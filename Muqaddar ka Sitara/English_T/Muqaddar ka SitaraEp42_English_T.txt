[01:08] Greetings Mother!
[01:09] Greetings darling! How are you?
[01:11] I'm doing all good. What about you?
[01:14] Yup! I'm fine too.
[01:15] Tell me that did Nisar come to pick you up?
[01:18] No mother! actually I'm still attending my last class. He'll come after this class ends.
[01:22] Have you informed him?
[01:24] Yes mother, I did.
[01:26] Fine!
[01:27] Darling! Stay conscious and careful!
[01:33] You understand, Right?
[01:34] Mother! Don't you worry at all. I know it.
[01:37] Good! I expected this from you.
[01:41] Listen! You're father said that if you ever need anything, do tell. He'll send you the money for it.
[01:48] No mother! I have cash on me already. I saved some from last month. I'll surely ask if I need some.
[01:53] Sure! Take good care of yourself.
[01:56] Listen! There is a fight between boys outside. Come on, leave this place quick!
[02:17] Fizza, don't worry. Come with me.
[02:19] Where are you talking me? You should not worry, I'm all good.
[02:22] Why should I not worry.
[02:24] Can't you see? They are fighting.
[02:26] Please let me help you.
[02:27] I don't need your help. I'll manage it myself.
[02:30] Fizza! Please.
[02:32] Don't act like a fool in such situation.
[02:35] Everybody else might need you. Go and help them out! Leave me alone.
[02:59] Hello!
[03:00] Hello! hello Fizza.
[03:04] Where are you Fizza?
[03:05] I'm all good! Where are you?
[03:08] You should send me your location. I'll come and pick you.
[03:11] No! No! You should not come inside the institute! There is a fight going on.
[03:14] You should wait at the gate. I'll come there myself! It's a fuss here.
[03:18] No! You wait there. I'll come and pick you myself.
[03:20] No! It's a rush of people inside. You should understand that it'll be difficult for you to find me.
[03:24] I'm coming to the gate myself!
[03:27] Fine! But be careful. I'm also arriving on the gate in a bit.
[03:30] Sure! I'm coming. OK, goodbye.
[05:20] I thought that we'll have a nice conversation, but after seeing you in such condition. I forgot everything.
[05:28] I'm still here for the next 2 months. I hope you won't deny meeting me again.
[05:38] Sure! But It'll be difficult for us to meet in university. You can meet me later at my home.
[05:46] That'll be great! I would love to see your home.
[05:49] It'll be great meeting uncle and aunt too.
[05:53] Should I drop you to your hostel now?
[05:55] No! I won't go to my hostel. You can drop me at my sisters home. Safdar uncle is there too.
[06:03] That's good. You'll also get proper care there too. You need it.
[06:08] And ask Hadia to care for you. She'll surely!
[06:11] This is why I think you should ....
[06:29] Just drop me as we are getting late already. Let's get going.
[06:35] Sure!
[07:16] Take care. I hope we'll meet soon!
[07:20] Sure!
[07:22] I'm really sorry! I wasted a lot of your time.
[07:26] No! Don't say that. It's nothing like that. I myself wanted to meet you and spend some time with you.
[07:32] And believe me! I enjoyed it.
[07:35] I just felt a little bad after seeing you in such condition.
[07:38] Don't you worry! I'll be fine soon. Take care.
[07:43] Goodbye!
[07:47] Goodbye!
[08:07] Ma'am!
[08:12] What?
[08:13] The younger sister of Hadia ma'am is here.
[08:17] Who? Fizza?
[08:19] She is injured and in a bad condition!
[08:24] It's always a new drama, every other day.
[08:27] Hadia ma'am told me to inform you and Safdar sir!
[08:32] Why! What's with us.
[08:36] Go! Wait a second.
[08:41] Go and tell Safdar sir about this! I'll go and see them.
[08:47] Sure ma'am.
[08:52] I should go and see what's with this Fizza now.
[09:03] Sit here comfortably. No one is going to disturb you.
[09:07] Sister! You are worried like I got in a deadly accident. It's just a minor scuff, and I am all good.
[09:12] Don't say such foolish stuff. Have you told father about this?
[09:17] No! I didn't tell father about this. You should also not. He'll get worried for nothing.
[09:23] OK! Now go ahead and drink some milk.
[09:27] Sister, I'm healthy and fit. It's just a minor injury. I was just a little scared at that time, that is why I quickly came to you.
[09:36] And I was just a bit upset because there was no family member with me at that time.
[09:43] And Nisar also wanted to drop me at your doorstep after seeing me in such condition.
[09:49] Oh! So you came here because of Nisar?
[09:53] No Sister! I also wanted to visit you myself!
[09:59] Sure! I understand it already.
[10:04] Now quickly finish your milk.
[10:07] You always force me sister. I'm all good! It's just a minor pain, it'll be fine in a bit.
[10:12] Milk will help you with your pain!
[10:14] Greetings!
[10:16] Greetings!
[10:18] Where are you coming from in such a condition?
[10:21] Actually, in university...  Greetings uncle!
[10:26] Greetings! Why are you injured Fizza? What happened in the university?
[10:33] Nothing uncle. It's just that some boys started to fight in groups, inside the university. I got entangled between them.
[10:41] It's good that you came here directly. This is also your house. Who would've looked after you in the hostel. Hadia is here for you.
[10:51] You should be here to take care of your sister as you know her condition, but whatever.
[10:58] No aunt! don't you worry at all. I won't disturb my sister at all.
[11:09] I just came here for a bit. I'll leave soon.
[11:12] You did a fine job of thinking to come here directly.
[11:15] I would have sent a driver for you, If you had called. How did you reach ?
[11:21] Nisar dropped me.
[11:33] Is Nisar back?
[11:36] Yes father! I was thinking of inviting him, uncle and aunt on a dinner.
[11:43] Sure! Why not? We'll also invite your parent's too.
[11:48] Just look at there condition right now. You still want to have a dinner in the house this urgent?
[11:53] They are both doing fine! They'll both enjoy when they meet their parents and relatives too. Now you should rest Fizza!
[12:02] You can stay here as long as you want to. It's just like your second home. Hadia is also feeling happy, as you've came to stay with her.
[12:11] Uncle I cannot stay! It won't look good.
[12:15] What are you talking about? Treat it as your own home. If you stay, It'll make us feel good too.
[12:24] And it'll be better if you skip your university for some days.
[12:30] It'll be better for you as we don't know what is gonna happen in next few days.
[12:37] Father won't allow me.
[12:38] Who'll inform your father?
[12:43] I'll talk to him myself. But don't let her leave this place for a week at all Hadia! Take good care of her.
[13:13] No one can speak in front of our father!
[13:27] Aleem is always acting so nice and caring, like he is the only one with nobility.
[13:30] But when his own daughter is roaming around in the whole city with her fiancée, where is his nobility?
[13:37] Or it's just because he doesn't know about anything.
[13:41] What are you talking about?
[13:44] There was a fight in her university! She would've been scared.
[13:48] If he came to pick her up, It's nothing bad. I felt good after listening to this.
[13:54] I think this is all in Aleem's notice already.
[14:00] Sure! You've become so broadminded.
[14:03] You have never allowed your daughter to ever meet or roam around with her male friends.
[14:08] It's because there is a difference between friends and fiancée.
[14:14] The boy is only here for two months. If Fizza interacts with him during this period, It's not a big deal at all.
[14:20] He is so innocent. I know his father really well! You know him as well. He is the son of Abdul Rehman !
[14:27] Whatever! I didn't like such an action of her. And why did you let her stay?
[14:33] Is there a need of your relatives in this house?
[14:39] She is the sister of Hadia! She can come and visit this house at anytime. We should not stop her from meeting her sister at all.
[14:46] And you know that Hadia is already depressed!
[14:50] It's so good that she came. They'll both get better and enjoy with each other.
[14:55] And if Hadia tells something to her sister. Then what?
[14:57] She won't! I have told her about this, and she understands.
[15:03] I can still trust Hadia.
[15:07] But her younger sister is too sharp. She can understand anything according to the situation.
[15:14] For god's sake Sheena! Don't go that deep.
[15:20] You should be happy that we are finally going to be grandparents. We all should be happy, but you've started to discuss some foolish stuff.
[15:27] And why did you allow to invite them all on a dinner? It's between Aleem and Rehman directly. Why should we arrange a dinner for them?
[15:35] Seriously? You know that they both are my mutual friends. It's my love for them that I invited them together. Now stop with these foolish questions.
[16:10] Greetings Safdar! How are you?
[16:13] Greetings Aleem! I'm doing fine. What about you, and how is your wife?
[16:19] Good! Great! Everything is fine and my wife is also good.
[16:24] It's just that she is lonely and always thinking about Hadia, and now Fizza has left for her studies in Karachi too. You know she stays worried for both.
[16:34] Tell her to not worry about them at all! Hadia is safe and healthy, and Fizza is also here to meet Hadia. I just met them both together. No need to worry at all.
[16:47] Fizza is at your place? When? Why? She didn't inform me.
[16:56] Aleem! Don't worry, as she is fine. Actually two groups started to fight in her university! She just felt a little disturbed. That's why she came to her sister.
[17:07] She didn't inform me at all after going through all of this? I'll come and pick her from your place, tomorrow! Thank you for informing.
[17:17] No! You don't need to come. She is at her own house. It's the same as Hadia is like my daughter, Fizza is too! As her university gets back to normal.
[17:25] I'll go myself and drop her to university! You should not worry about anything at all.
[17:30] As you wish! But I'll inform Khadija. If she gets this news afterwards, She'll get stressed.
[17:41] Then I'll see, If she wants to come. We'll inform.
[17:44] Sure! Take care. Goodbye!
[17:49] Goodbye!
[17:57] I should go and inform Khadija !
[18:06] Now this was left! What's wrong with Father? We have no privacy left at all.
[18:15] Your father bought this big house for his relatives to visit and stay!
[18:20] I no longer feel like this is my own home.
[18:23] I feel like staying at some other place.
[18:25] What has happened to you both? Relax! She is here only for a week, not her whole life.
[18:34] Listen! Try to ignore her. Don't converse with her that much.
[18:39] Do you really think that I'm that free. I won't.
[18:43] That's a fact! You never have time for your wife. Why would you manage some for her sister?
[18:51] What about that affair of yours! The one, Raazi informed us about. Is it true?
[19:03] Go ask Raazi yourself! Why are you asking me.
[19:09] Seriously?
[19:17] Mother! If Raazi has informed such a problem to us about Faizan. Why are we not taking it seriously.
[19:27] That Raazi is a huge hypocrite. Don't you ever take his name again, in front of me.
[19:52] What have done as a father of Hadia? How can you let Fizza stay there?
[19:58] It's just for a week.
[20:02] And she just went to her own sister's home! The situation in her university is bad, so it's not good for her to stay in hostel yet.
[20:11] I am satisfied of Hadia also living in Karachi.
[20:15] She could have came back to us. Lived with us for a while. I didn't force her to stay in her hostel in such situation.
[20:21] Why don't you understand Khadija? It's not just her sister's home. It's also her uncle's home.
[20:27] It's also her aunt's home! You know Sheena very well.
[20:34] Hadia is their daughter in law! Handling everything is her duty.
[20:38] But Fizza! Why should she cope up with their problems?
[20:44] I've already talked.
[20:48] This is your problem. You always talk without coordination.
[20:55] Try to think before taking any such action.
[21:02] I think my opinion is a disgrace to you, Right?
[21:08] Khadija darling! Why are you always so negative?
[21:12] Why shouldn't I be?
[21:17] You never deny to anything Safdar asks for! I know it surely that if he invites us to stay at his place, right now.
[21:24] It'll take you only some seconds to pack everything and move.
[21:30] Khadija!
[22:07] Hey! Where are you going so fast?
[22:11] I'm going to join Fizza in the lawn.
[22:14] Fizza is here right? She is not running anywhere.
[22:16] You should be careful!
[22:18] You don't care about yourself at all! But what will we say to your parents?
[22:23] That this is how we are taking your care?
[22:25] And your sister will surely tell everything about us, when she gets back to her home.
[22:31] I'll be careful from now on!
[22:33] And you only care about your close ones!
[22:37] You don't care about us at all!
[22:41] Have you ever thought of Natasha? The trauma she went through?
[22:48] Have you even talked or asked her about her health?
[22:51] I actually..
[22:52] I don't need your foolish explanation.
[22:57] Remember this! My kids should never be stressed because of you.
[23:04] You should start taking responsibility! Stay responsible to Faizan specially. As I can see you are non serious towards him.
[23:14] And also ask your sister to stay in one place. She should not start roaming around the whole place.
[23:21] She wasn't that injured, that we have to deal with her for the whole week.
[23:40] So bad! Why don't you complain about him.
[23:45] I'm thinking of complaining about him.
[23:50] But he just got his admission in this university. You know they'll expel him! It was so difficult for him already to get admitted in medical department.
[23:58] Mother and father have sent me here. I cannot break there trust in me.
[24:05] You are right but whats the other solution for this problem?
[24:09] I don't know sister. I'll let God handle with this. I am thinking of discussing about this with Nisar!
[24:16] He is so caring, sharp and broadminded! He might be helpful.
[24:20] You are so lucky that your partner is just like you.
[24:26] That's true!
[24:27] It's a fact madam! Keep yourself safe from evil eye. I really love your relationship.
[24:37] I'm just waiting for you both to get married. I'll enjoy so much.
[24:44] Don't mind. I've come here but I don't enjoy you and Faizan staying so distanced from each other. I didn't see such a thing in your photos of Murree.
[24:59] He is always busy with his official work. He comes to the house at night when he is tired. That's why I let him rest.
[25:05] What's with he staying so busy always sister?
[25:08] Safdar uncle is way more busy than him, but still gives proper attention and time to his family. Is Faizan more busy than him?
[25:17] Why are you thinking like that?
[25:20] He is really caring towards me! He even reminds me of my medicines if I forget to take them.
[25:26] May that be the truth!
[25:32] I still worry about you after I remember the behavior of Faizan in the beginning.
[25:38] May god be with you.
[25:41] Now at least eat these apples I've cut.
[25:45] No! You should eat. I don't want to.
[25:50] I'll get late! fine. OK! OK!
[25:58] Raazi!
[26:01] Can you drop me?
[26:05] Where? To your friends again?
[26:09] No! Father gave me a number of psychologist. I thought I should go meet.
[26:17] I have booked an appointment already.
[26:20] Psychologist? Why?
[26:24] Actually! I've been feeling lonely and depressed from so many days. I thought it'll be better for me to give psychologist a visit.
[26:32] To feel better, you don't need to visit a psychologist! You can visit your friends and enjoy with them.
[26:42] You are right but I don't feel like joining my old friends!
[26:48] I also don't want that to happen.
[26:51] You should forget the old ones.
[26:53] Make some new friends!
[26:55] Will you be my friend?
[26:58] Were we enemies?
[27:00] Sure! We were never enemies, but our relation was not that great ever.
[27:07] We were cousins the whole time, but never felt like we were. I know it's not your fault.
[27:12] Totally mine! I was the one who always misbehaved. So sorry. I understand.
[27:19] It's OK!
[27:21] You are still annoying!
[27:25] Aren't you getting late? Hurry! Get in the driving seat.
[27:29] If you don't mind me telling you this, but don't visit a psychologist.
[27:35] Because you are not my friend yet?
[27:37] What's the other way of becoming friends.
[27:42] It's OK! Will you consider your friend's one statement?
[27:46] I'll affirm with all of your statements!
[27:51] Listen Natasha! Right now, It won't be good for you to go outside.
[27:59] Do you understand?
[28:01] No!
[28:03] Girls don't leave there house when they are in iddat!
[28:07] It's just been some days since you took divorce.
[28:10] And in such situation, you should not interact with any male at all, except your father and your brother. You should not even interact with me.
[28:17] I'll take you on a dinner when your iddat completes!
[28:24] Fine?
[28:25] Sure!
[28:48] Natasha ma'am! Your mother is calling you.
[28:52] Go and tell her that I'm coming!
[29:21] Here! Look what I got for you.
[29:25] Mother! I already own so many clothes. I didn't need more yet.
[29:34] Natasha! Don't you remember your craze for shopping? It was like a hobby to you.
[29:42] Mother! I don't need such things anymore.
[29:48] This is all happening specifically because of that Sherry!
[29:52] You've changed so much! I feel hurt when I see you like this.
[29:58] Your mentality, your way of thinking and your taste in things. Everything has changed.
[30:04] Mother! I need to forget my past. Why would you take his name in front of me, again and again.
[30:10] So that you become like before.
[30:13] That is why your dad booked you an appointment with the best psychiatrist, which you wasted.
[30:19] Mother! I don't need any psychiatrist to help me out with myself. I have already figured out the thing that'll keep me happy.
[30:29] Mother! please forget my past, and think about my future.
[30:57] Faizan hasn't arrived yet? What happened with you?
[31:02] Why are you crying? Hey! did you guys fight?
[31:08] No! nothing like that happened.
[31:11] Then why are you crying? and why is he not home yet?
[31:15] I think something went in my eye.
[31:19] You know that Faizan comes late!
[31:22] Yes! I can see that.
[31:28] He is just with some of his friends.
[31:35] Tell me one thing! You are hiding something from me, right? There is something that is hurting you.
[31:42] Tell me about it.
[31:44] There is nothing like that. I think its too late, so you should go and sleep now.
[31:48] Sister! I know you are hiding something. Tell me what happened.
[31:54] I can see that you guys were so close and loving towards each other before. After coming back from Islamabad, you treat each other like a stranger.
[32:02] Don't think like that.
[32:04] There can be some little problems between husband and wife, so that doesn't mean..
[32:10] Sister!
[32:11] Please tell me what happened, and why don't you go and talk about Faizan's behavior with Safdar uncle specifically.
[32:18] Quite!
[32:19] Enough sister! You have already been through a lot.
[32:24] Go and talk to Safdar uncle and inform him about Faizan's behavior towards you.
[32:30] Fizza! Stay quite. You wouldn't discuss this at all with anyone. Neither with father, nor with mother!
[32:39] I don't want to stress my parents at all. Understood!
[33:41] What is wrong Safdar! You look worried.
[33:48] Nothing!
[33:51] It's been so much time since I got married to you. You think I cannot judge your mood by you facial expressions? Tell me what's wrong?
[34:02] Sheena I think there is someone in the office, who is trying to mess around with our accounts.
[34:08] What? Who can it be?
[34:16] I don't know yet, but soon I will.
[34:22] It might be Raazi!
[34:26] Please Sheena!
[34:28] Sheena listen! Raazi is not just my nephew, but also a wise and honest man.
[34:36] I can trust him with closed eyes! I have already allowed him to my accounts with millions in it. He has never done anything foolish.
[34:42] Whatever! Punish that man with the worse after you find out.
[34:46] Even if it's someone close.
[34:49] Why do you always target Raazi?
[34:54] That is because I'm not blindfolded like you.
[34:58] I can judge Raazi very well, so I can clearly tell you that this is him!
[35:05] This is your problem! Raazi is just like my right hand. I trust him.
[35:12] Fine! As I already said that I'll reach that person quickly after some investigation.
[35:27] What was the amount?
[35:33] Millions!
[35:47] What is your problem? Why are you calling again and again?
[35:49] When will you come?
[35:51] Why do you care? does it matter to you?
[35:54] Why doesn't it? I'm your wife!
[35:56] Really?
[35:58] I thought you forgot me as a husband.
[36:01] Enough Faizan!
[36:03] Do you know Hadia? I'm at a point of no return right now!
[36:07] It won't help me with any of your explanations or apologies.
[36:12] Faizan! You are the one who cheated.
[36:18] Shut up Hadia!
[36:20] Why? The truth is bitter?
[36:22] Sure! I know I'm unfaithful.
[36:25] But you also spend some time with Raazi, when I'm not there?
[36:31] Faizan! for god sake, stop with this foolish talk.
[36:34] Why? You felt bad?
[36:37] I also feel bad when you call me unfaithful or cheater.
[36:41] You get me scolded by my own father. Now he has even started a proper check on me and my actions.
[36:48] Hadia! If you want everything just like before. You want me to care for you! You have help me clean my character in front of father.
[36:56] And say that Raazi is a liar.
[37:00] I cannot blame him for your doings!
[37:05] Then just forget me!
[37:06] Faizan! Don't let this topic spread.
[37:09] Come home! I'll forgive you and try forgetting everything you did.
[37:16] You know my condition. I am taking stress continuously. It's really bad for our child health.
[37:22] Hadia! Don't blackmail me because of my child.
[37:25] You know very well that I forgave you just because of this child.
[37:29] Faizan!
[37:42] What are you talking about? How can this happen? Who is he?
[37:49] It's Raazi!
[37:50] He is the one who saw me and Faizan together! and also told Faizan's father about us.
[37:56] Wow! You have told me such an amazing thing.
[38:01] I'm so happy! But I still cannot believe that Hadia being so humble and innocent, can do this too.
[38:10] But I'm really happy.
[38:13] There's also a bad news!
[38:15] And when you hear it! Your excitement will vanish.
[38:18] What's that?
[38:21] Hadia is pregnant!
[38:23] What?
