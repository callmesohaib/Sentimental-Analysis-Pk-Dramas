[01:13] you've made a very good routine. To leave for office in the morning without having breakfast
[01:18] and to stay in your room after coming back from office
[01:22] this is good!
[01:24] look...
[01:27] change your routine. Earlier your routine was good
[01:38] Faizan has started to come to office
[01:41] yes, so what is the big deal?
 Its his father's office, he can visit anytime
[01:47] mom, he hasn't come like that
[01:49] soon he will join the office
[01:52] so what's the harm in it?
[01:54] after all, he has to handle the business in the future
[02:01] uncle asks me to tell Faizan something about business, explain him
[02:07] have you checked his behavior?
[02:09] he doesn't have manners to talk to anyone
[02:14] he will never fix himself
[02:16] mom, Honestly...  I can give you in writing.
[02:20] he got married just to take over uncle's business
[02:24] he doesn't have any interest in Hadia
[02:25] from where Hadia came in between?
[02:30] didn't you see how much drama he was doing in the wedding ceremony?
[02:33] that's why I was saying it
[02:39] mom, besides the hard work that I did for both the restaurants
[02:47] he will ruin my entire hard work
[02:50] I know dear
[02:52] but its your duty to fulfill your uncle's order
[02:56] you cannot refuse it. He is your uncle, as well as your boss
[03:02] dear look! your anger is absolutely correct. But please control your anger a bit
[03:07] and tolerate Faizan as well
[03:13] he pays you the salary in millions
[03:15] by paying me the salary of millions he cannot..
[03:21] mom, I just give preference to working with respect
[03:26] I know dear, but don't ever forget your uncle's favors
[03:33] its his right that you shall fulfill his orders
[03:39] may you get settled
[03:42] and you get married, then we'll leave this house
[03:54] mom, we'll see what will happen
[04:10] today Faizan hasn't come on the dining table again?
[04:14] he must be coming
[04:18] Shina look, make him understand
[04:21] he has got married, he shouldn't stay out of the house for late night
[04:24] but today he came early
[04:26] not today, but yesterday
[04:29] ask him to change his routine
[04:32] why shall I change my routine?
[04:35] I've got married, I haven't been tied up. My routine will remain the same
[04:40] but now you have to give time to Hadia
[04:44] I give her the time as much as she deserves
[04:48] Faizan!
[04:49] why are you always after me?
where is Razi?
[04:53] he is not here, you don't say anything to him. But you are always after me
[04:59] Ok, I'll see
[05:03] sister...
[05:05] is everything alright? We didn't see Razi yesterday at the breakfast, also he is not there at the dinner too
[05:11] he was saying that he is not hungry, he will eat once he feels like eating
[05:15] you are right
[05:17] actually...
[05:20] gathering together at the dining table is just an excuse, but in actual
[05:24] its important to sit together & talk to each other
[05:28] if everyone has to do the same thing & have to go inside the room, then what's the use of it?
[05:34] let me call him right away. Dear, go tell him that his uncle is calling him
[05:38] Okay
[05:40] he will come in a while
[05:43] shall we start eating?
[05:45] dear, have some
[05:50] pour me some water
[05:53] yes
[05:58] hey!
[06:01] greetings!
[06:03] greetings to you too! dear come, the rice are so delicious
[06:06] Hadia, pass them to Razi
[06:22] sister, do you know that today was Faizan's first day at office
[06:29] really! all praise to God. How was your day today?
[06:34] good
[06:35] I must say, if he will keep on giving time to Razi after leaving his stupid friends
[06:42] then that day is not far, when he will learn everything
[06:58] I'm done!
[07:23] Safder, there is a limit! You should leave a chance
[07:28] I accept that you nephew is very intelligent, but Faizan is your son
[07:34] at least don't degrade him in front of everyone
[08:01] dear, eat food please
[08:13] Natasha has agreed to marry Mrs. Rehman's son
[08:17] really!
[08:20] thank you, Khalid
[08:21] who told you this?
[08:24] she had told me herself
[08:26] So talk to them quickly
[08:30] what are you saying?
[08:32] Shina, I am a daughter's father. Will it look good if I will talk to him?
[08:36] what do you mean, Safder? Why are you being of so old school?
[08:39] nowadays, girls are proposing guys
[08:42] then why can't a girl's family talk to the boy's family?
[08:47] really? and where is it happening?
[08:49] come on I'm serious. Please quickly invite them for a dinner
[08:54] ok fine, Someday I will invite them on a dinner
[08:58] please invite them quickly, because their son Nisar is soon going back to America
[09:03] Shina, be careful about one thing
[09:06] please ask Natasha to...
[09:08] wear a nice dress in front of them, so that we don't have to face embarrassment in front of them
[09:14] no doubt they are filthy rich, but they are associated with their roots & culture
[09:20] I don't want to give them an impression that our children are very modern
[09:24] now see, there is an example in our house. Look at Hadia...
[09:27] please! you are talking about my daughter, so don't praise Hadia here
[09:38] if Natasha gets married to an industrialist's son
[09:42] then we'll be praised in the entire business circle
[09:45] what if it didn't happen, then?
[09:47] this needs to happen, and why won't it happen?
[09:50] you've got me humiliated by marrying Faizan with Hadia
[09:55] I mean, when my friends asks me that what does Faizan's father in law do
[10:00] I ignore them by staying quiet, what should I say to them?
[10:05] that he is the head master of a small school, which is gifted to him by my husband
[10:09] Shina, so much of proud is not good
[10:12] maybe your are forgetting that your daughter is unable to do graduation since past few years
[10:18] however, their son is going abroad to become a doctor
[10:22] if their son rejected your daughter, then your dream will be shattered that your daughter's father in law is such a big industrialist
[10:32] nowadays, status counts a lot more than education
[10:36] she is Safder Kamal's daughter, & that should be enough for them
[10:39] you are wrong!
[10:41] look! if this was the case then, I had brought Hadia as my daughter in law because of her education
[10:48] maybe she had completed her education, but she can never match the status
[10:56] may God show you the right path
[11:09] mom looks worried for you. You guys are always together, is everything fine?
[11:13] aren't you guys planning against my wife?
[11:16] wait! wife!
[11:18] haven't you accepted her?
[11:22] she is just like a doll
she is pretty & beautiful
[11:26] I like my room, in her presence
[11:30] wow! how you've defined your wife
[11:33] I've defined her, you also define Razi
[11:38] and why do I need to do that?
[11:41] because the way Hadia is imposed on me
[11:44] its dad's plan to impose Razi on your head in the same way. And I'm sure he can do that
[11:51] it won't happen now
[11:55] what do you mean?
[11:56] because I am getting ready to go to USA
[11:59] with the people of my own standard
[12:03] what! and why I don't know this matter?
[12:06] because you don't take an interest
[12:08] I do take interest but you...
ok I am interested now, so tell me the details
[12:14] well.. his name is Nisar, he is a doctor in USA. He is Mr. & Mrs. Rehman's son
[12:23] mom likes him, dad likes him. Its all set
[12:26] and yes, I kind of have to
[12:29] he is Rehman uncle's son, right?
he is a good guy, I know him
[12:32] yes
[12:33] he is a nice guy. You've got a lottery so easily, congratulations!
[12:38] but you got trapped so badly
[12:41] I'm not trapped
[12:43] I've just one motive
[12:47] to take over dad's business, that's it!
[12:50] So, its yours
[12:53] don't you know dad?
[12:56] he will always keep Razi as my boss, & I cannot tolerate that man
[13:00] I genuinely hate him
[13:04] I agree with you on that
[13:06] same here
[13:08] learn how to play
[13:11] you should learn how to shut up!
[13:16] mom!... mom
[13:18] what happen?
[13:22] oh God!
[13:24] my result came
[13:26] I've topped in my entire college
[13:29] congratulations!
[13:32] all praise to God!
I am going to order sweetmeats right away
[13:37] we will distribute it in the entire neighborhood
[13:39] what is the need to do this formality?
 Its not a big deal though
[13:45] what are you saying?
[13:48] my daughter has topped in her college
[13:52] and she got second position in the board
[13:55] is there any other girl in the entire Hyderabad, who did this?
[14:00] earlier, it was our Hadia and now its our Fizza
[14:04] very good my dear
[14:06] I'm proud of you
[14:09] oh yes! I'm thinking to send some sweetmeats to Karachi. To Hadia's house
[14:17] what is the need to do this uselessly?
[14:20] what do you mean by uselessly?
[14:23] its a joyous occasion
[14:26] its our happiness, not theirs. What connection do they have with it?
[14:30] how come they don't have a connection? We have a connection with Hadia, so think that we are sending it for her
[14:35] as it is, won't she be happy in her sister's happiness?
[14:40] how will you send it?
[14:45] we'll send it via courier
[14:47] courier? But I was thinking to tell sister myself
[14:56] Okay... 
[14:58] if this is the matter, then lets go there tomorrow
[15:03] done! but please don't call sister. We'll give her a surprise after going there
[15:09] Okay? Let me ask my friend about their results
[15:15] she is so happy
[15:16] yes... may God keep her happy
[15:21] now its confirmed that she will get an admission in the medical college
[15:24] you guys came all of a sudden. At least you should have informed me before coming so that I could have done some arrangements for you
[15:29] No, there is no need to do anything. Actually we were passing by, so we thought to meet you
[15:35] I hope we haven't disturbed you
[15:38] absolutely not, brother Rehman. In fact Safder will be happy to know that you guys are here
[15:44] by the way, where are your children? I can't see them
[15:47] actually Faizan has joined Safder's office
[15:53] this is such a good news
[15:55] and Natasha has gone to the salon. Let me go & call Safder, please sit for a while
[16:07] we have discussed this detail, what we need to do is... check these samples
[16:13] there shouldn't be any lacking in the color
[16:16] we have to work on the same color grading
[16:18] any questions?
one second
[16:23] hello!
[16:24] Safder, Mr. & Mrs. Rehman are here
[16:29] really! all of a sudden?
[16:31] ok tell me, where is Natasha?
[16:35] she has gone to the gym
[16:37] oh God! this girl... 
[16:39] anyways, do one thing. Make an arrangement for high tea
[16:44] and there shouldn't be anything missing. I'm leaving in ten minutes, Ok?
[16:49] Ok
[16:57] alright then, anymore questions?

[17:00] Okay, work on it. And ensure that I want the file on my table tomorrow
[17:05] ok

[17:08] take out the car, bring it at the front. I'm coming
[17:16] what to tell you, I'm so thankful to God that my son Faizan & nephew Razi
[17:22] both of them work with me
[17:25] and she is my daughter in law
[17:28] yes, I remember. I saw her at the wedding, and I haven't forgotten your daughter in law
[17:35] dear, what is your qualification?
[17:38] aunty, I've done masters in Urdu Literature
[17:43] wow!
very good!
[17:45] do you know, it was my favorite too
[17:48] do you know, my daughter in law used to handle the entire school in Hyderabad
[17:53] really! Glad to know this
[17:57] please take some brownies, Natasha had made them as she loves baking. She is always busy in the kitchen
[18:05] that's fine, but where is she?
[18:08] she has gone somewhere, she must be on her way back

[19:19] Okay
[19:22] dear come, what do you do? what are your hobbies?
[19:26] uncle, nothing to special
[19:28] nowadays, I am doing fashion designing, shopping & outing. That's it!
[19:36] these are the hobbies of the children of her age
[19:38] No, this is not the matter. Even my daughter is of the same age group
[19:43] she likes to read books like your daughter in law
[19:48] she doesn't like shopping at all. Do you know, I do shopping for her
[19:52] yes, if she likes something then its gardening
[19:56] and do you know, the lawn of her house is beautiful because of her
[20:00] I will show you whenever you will come to our house
[20:04] yes sure
[20:06] and dear, I think you like to do gardening as well
[20:10] yes aunty, your daughter's hobbies are like mine. I love to do gardening, book reading, also I love to keep pet animals too
[20:19] really! this is so good
[20:27] Hadia, will you keep on talking or will serve them?
[20:31] yes
[20:33] No dear, its ok. We have already eaten a lot
[20:39] greetings!*
[20:43] please come
[20:44] greetings!*
[20:47] please come in, brother Aleem
[20:51] it seems that we have disturbed you guys by coming here
[20:57] what are you saying, brother Aleem? its your own house
[21:02] please come, let me introduce you to my friend. He is Mr. Rehman
[21:05] and brother Rehman, he is Hadia's father
[21:12] greetings!*
[21:14] how are you?
fine?
[21:16] sister, do you know I have done top in the entire college
[21:20] really!
yes
[21:21] all praise to God, heartiest congratulations to you!
[21:25] all praise to God that my daughter has done top in FSC medical
[21:31] really! heartiest congratulations to you my dear
[21:35] thank you so much, uncle
[21:38] Safder, I had told you that my younger daughter wants to do medical
[21:43] since her result was announced today, so I thought to distribute sweet meats to you
[21:50] thanks a lot for so much of respect
[21:52] all praise to God, congratulations to you!
[21:54] thank you!
[21:55] both of your daughters are so intelligent
[21:58] just now I was talking to Hadia & she told us that she did her masters in Urdu Literature
[22:02] yes, actually both of them like studying
[22:07] Hadia wanted to become a lecturer & my younger one wants to become a Doctor
[22:13] good!
[22:14] our son is also doing medical residency in America
[22:19] Okay
[22:21] please sit, lets discuss other things by sitting. Please
[22:24] please sit
[23:02] have you seen the consequences of giving them a lot of importance?
[23:07] I mean, they have considered our house as theirs. They come here whenever they want to
[23:13] they don't have manners to call before coming here
[23:19] what's with you, Shina?
[23:21] its their daughter's house
[23:23] its not their daughter's house, but their daughter's in-laws house
[23:28] and there is a separate importance & status of a daughter's in-laws house
[23:33] you used to say that he has got very high self respect. That he won't drink the water of his daughter's in-laws house
[23:38] now see
[23:41] Safder, I am amazed that its been only a week that his daughter got married
[23:47] and they have visiting us so frequently. I don't get it
[23:51] I mean, they don't get tired by traveling for so long
[23:57] I think they are doing all of this intentionally, they came here intentionally
[24:03] what are you saying?
[24:05] how would they know about this matter?
[24:08] no doubt they are unaware of this matter, but he has checked out all of your friends families very well
[24:15] and Mrs. Rehman, what is the name of Hadia's sister? Fizza!
[24:20] she was looking at her in such a manner, as if she is some princess
[24:24] what do you think, haven't she noticed all of this?
[24:29] anyways, this is our delusion or maybe coincidence
[24:32] Safder, I don't agree. And who knows whether the news of her top rank is true or false
[24:40] there isn't any such thing
[24:43] I know these girls since childhood, they are so intelligent
[24:46] ok please, for God sake I don't want to hear a single word in their favor. And don't praise them please!
[24:53] look at this, I beg you. Make him understand
[24:59] tell him & stop him, for God sake!
[25:06] we were fortunate to get a good proposal for Natasha
[25:09] and that too..
[25:13] do you know how hurt Natasha is
[25:17] I tried to get rid of David with a lot of difficulty
[25:20] how come brother Aleem is at fault?
[25:22] why are you blaming him?
[25:24] if there is someone's fault, then its your daughter's
[25:27] didn't you see her style of coming & her dress?
[25:30] so, even Mr. & Mrs. Rehman came without informing
[25:34] don't know for what they came
[25:36] if Natasha learns to stay in her limits, then we won't have an objection upon anyone coming to our house uninvited
[25:43] this is happening because
[25:45] anyways leave it. Go & do shopping for her, make her wear what suits her
[25:52] people will keep visiting our house, please!
[25:56] you argue in every matter
[26:48] what is the matter?
[26:51] you are so quiet
[26:52] has anything happened yesterday?
[26:58] why do you always think this way?
[27:03] and why do you always refuse me?
[27:07] whenever you meet them, there is something hurting for sure
[27:15] accept it that you cannot hide anything from me
[27:18] I'm your wife
[27:19] we've been together since 25 years, its not a joke
[27:24] come on, now tell me what happened
[27:27] nothing as such has happened
[27:31] do you believe, that sister Shina didn't uttered a single word
[27:39] and don't know why but I had felt that
[27:43] brother Safder hadn't met with warmth of affection like he used to have it earlier
[27:49] it felt as if he doesn't like me coming over there
[27:53] why will he be happy to meet us now? as his work is already done
[28:00] he took our competent daughter for his incompetent son
[28:04] whether you accept it or not, but brother Safder has betrayed you in his friendship
[28:10] I had told you not to go there
[28:13] it wasn't such a big deal, as our daughters do top every year
[28:18] but you didn't listen to me at all. And now you've got yourself insulted
[28:28] anyways leave it, drink your tea its getting cold
[28:35] and listen! now don't arrange a party
[28:40] Fizza will celebrate at home with her friends, ok?
[28:47] now leave it, and drink this
[28:51] thank you!
[29:01] after all, what does he think of himself?
[29:03] I'm not a kid anymore, that he will teach me how to walk
[29:08] relax dear!
[29:10] look! I don't think so that its a bad idea
[29:15] you have never attended any business meeting as of yet, this way you will get some training too
[29:20] please mom! at least you don't talk like him. And training for what?
[29:26] I will understand everything by going to the office for a week, but no!
[29:29] he just want me to work under Razi & shall learn from him
[29:32] and who is Razi? Who is he? He is a useless guy. He is nobody
[29:37] look! don't get insulted by equating yourself with Razi
[29:44] your status is different definitely. 
But try to understand
[29:50] see, this is true that you are not well aware of the business as of yet & Razi
[29:56] he is still helping your father, he knows about the business dealings
[30:02] at least try to understand this point
[30:06] Ok I understand, fine!
[30:08] but only Razi can teach me? Can't I learn anything while staying with dad?
[30:14] your dad is usually busy my dear
[30:18] like always
[30:20] he never have time for me
[30:23] and guess what? Even I am not idle now
[30:27] tell him clearly, if I will go to the office then I will go as Safder Kamal's son
[30:32] and I need my own space, I want my own office
[30:35] and there is no need to impose a useless & non-sense guy like Razi on my head
[30:41] your ...
[30:46] we cannot talk in peace anywhere
[30:52] if I have disturbed you guys then I will come later
[30:57] since you've come now, so tell me what would you like to say?
[31:02] actually I wanted to tell you, that my father has kept a party on this weekend as Fizza has done top
[31:08] all of you are invited
[31:18] your father came on that day
[31:21] he came by himself or you had called him?
[31:25] he came to surprise me
[31:27] I know that
[31:29] I'm asking, whether he came by himself or you had called him here?
[31:35] he came by himself
[31:38] by the way, your father is such a traditional guy
[31:41] but didn't he mind coming to his daughter's in-laws house uninvited?
[31:48] I am unable to understand, what have you mind?
[31:53] my dad coming here, or the way he came here uninvited?
[31:58] your father shows a lot of traditions at all times
[32:01] doesn't he realize that he shouldn't go to his daughter's in-laws house without informing?
[32:11] tell me, will he come to blow the trumpets of such a petty matter that your sister has done the top?
[32:19] and is she the first girl who has done top?
[32:22] its not a very big deal, thousands of girls do top. But it doesn't mean that he will blow the trumpets
[32:28] you guys have impressed Mrs. Rehman
[32:32] what else do you want now?
[32:38] tell your father, that he has got his daughter married to Faizan Kamal
[32:44] he should sit in peace now
[32:46] maybe, it doesn't make any difference to him that he will travel to Karachi & Hyderabad constantly
[32:52] but we are not that idle to go to your house on petty matters
[32:58] aunty, don't be upset. I will tell him that you cannot come
[33:04] I & Faizan will go
[33:14] what!
[33:18] I will go with you?
[33:22] didn't you tell her that we had gone in the wedding with such a difficulty
[33:26] I mean...
[33:29] I will go to Hyderabad again? what is in there?
[33:33] I was too exhausted when I had gone there earlier, I won't go. Sorry!
[33:36] Faizan, please don't say this
[33:39] please come with me for once, my dad will be happy to see you. He has invited you all with lots of love
[33:44] your father does everything with so much of love
[33:47] but please Hadia, tell him not to blackmail us with his lovely gesture
[33:53] we don't have courage to reply back to his love
[34:04] now if you don't want to say anything else then...
[34:22] what was the matter of impressing Mrs. Rehman?
[34:27] what to tell you?
[34:29] that day they came...
[34:47] how will I refuse dad?
[34:51] he has invited everyone with so much of love
[34:54] even Fizza will be upset
[34:57] but I have to refuse him
[35:01] I have to make an excuse
[35:09] I've always kept Faizan & his family's mistakes as a secret
[35:14] I will do the same this time as well
[35:20] sister, you are here? And I have been searching for you in the entire house
[35:25] do you have any work?
[35:26] the lunch is served, come have it
[35:30] you guys eat, I am not hungry
[35:33] you haven't done the breakfast properly
[35:38] is there any matter? please tell me if there is any
[35:43] No, its nothing. Don't worry
[35:46] please eat, I will eat if I will feel hungry
[35:49] promise?
[36:23] yes sir?
[36:24] they are my special friends, so bring starters
[36:27] Sir, place an order
[36:28] tell Razi to send the best of the things in the menu
[36:31] and yes!
[36:47] sir Faizan has asked me to do a birthday arrangement in the restaurant of 40 to 45 people
[36:53] who had asked? Faizan?
[36:55] yes
[36:59] Ok fine
[37:05] Mr. Faiz
[37:06] what is all this?
[37:09] Sir, this is becoming his daily routine
[37:12] every other day his friends are partying, & they create disturbance by their presence
[37:17] and sir, now we have started to receive complains as well
[37:21] Sir, what do you say? Shall I arrange the party?
[37:24] yes, get it arranged
[37:26] and listen! Do I have any appointment in the evening?
[37:29] yes sir, you do have
[37:47] by the way, there is some problem for sure
[37:51] because I have never seen sister Hadia so worried ever
[37:56] yes, I haven't seen happiness on her face since she got married
[38:04] even this time its must be Faizan's fault
[38:07] he must have hurt that poor girl
[38:11] maybe now she would have realized
[38:16] that this marriage was her wrong decision
[38:19] I wish, Faizan shall straighten himself
[38:23] and shall not ruin Hadia's life, that's it!
[38:27] its very difficult, mom
[38:30] a person who doesn't have his father's respect in his heart, can he fix himself ever?
[38:33] all of this is the result of my brother's leniency
[38:36] if he would have been strict with his kids since beginning, then he wouldn't have faced this day
[38:40] other families also live in America, but everyone's kids aren't spoiled
[38:46] you are absolutely correct
[38:48] all of this is the result of wrong upbringing
[38:51] uncle is still concerned about his children, he wants to fix them
[38:56] but aunt Shina
[39:01] Natasha & brother Faizan are getting spoiled because of aunt Shina's support
[39:04] dear, just pray that God makes ease for everyone
[39:10] Amen
[39:15] mom, sister Hadia hadn't eaten anything
[39:18] really!
[39:20] anyways, let me go & check. This work is done, I'm going then
