[01:18] You think that no one would marry me if you'd refuse?
[01:26] Don't forget it
[01:28] I'm daughter of Safdar Kamal. Remember it
[02:03] Raazi
[02:05] You are here
[02:06] Go to your uncle. He needs you right now
[02:10] Let him be alone. He's too worried
[02:13] I don't believe it that she could do this
[02:16] God knows who manipulated her taking this big decision?
[02:21] hmm
[02:24] its good somehow
[02:27] now I have got rid of her
[02:35] Its too late. You go to bed
[02:39] hmm
[02:51] I have called her 10 times since morning. She isn't receiving my phone
[02:54] why are you trying?
[02:56] Leave her alone. She'll come when she'd have to
[03:00] She's my daughter. How can I leave her alone?
[03:10] Greetings!
[03:11] Greetings! Is everything okay? You are here early in the morning?
[03:17] Yes, I'm here to meet sister
[03:19] Okay! I think you have got all the news of this house
[03:24] You are here for the drama?
[03:27] No auntie, there is nothing like that
[03:30] what happened? Is everything okay? Why are you saying this?
[03:33] Hadia is upstairs. Go and meet her
[03:37] If any news would leak to your in laws, then remember
[03:41] I would ban her to enter this house
[03:56] what?
[03:58] what was the need of saying this in front of her?
[04:00] its her fault
[04:01] how is it her fault? Natasha had to run. She has
[04:05] Its her fault. Its Fizza's fault
[04:07] Natasha was disheartened after Nissar rejected her. This is why she ran away
[04:12] otherwise, she wasn't interested in Sherry
[04:15] Seriously mother?
[04:16] yes
[04:19] how will I live?
[04:27] At least pick up the phone
[04:29] I had only one class in university today
[04:31] I got free early so I thought
[04:33] to visit you. I'll sit for a while and talk
[04:37] but when I came here
[04:39] environment of the house looks disturbed. Everyone is tensed
[04:42] Brother Faizan seems upset
[04:45] Is everything okay?
[04:46] You shouldn't have come without informing. Next time, do inform me
[04:51] I'm so sorry. I had no idea
[04:54] that I'd have to inform before coming to your house
[04:57] it isn't that, Fizza
[05:00] Everyone is upset at home. You are here suddenly so Faizan and sister would now think
[05:05] that it is me who leaking things to my family
[05:08] what happened? Tell me?
[05:09] Promise that you won't tell anyone, especially father
[05:16] I told mother because she insisted
[05:20] fine but what happened?
[05:23] Natasha left the house
[05:26] she has left the house? Where?
[05:52] Look at this
[05:53] I got food for you from your favorite restaurant
[05:57] Lunch, dinner, breakfast, its the same routine since I'm here
[06:02] I'm getting bored now
[06:03] Natasha, what else can be done in this tension?
[06:12] Lets go outside. Lets plan a foreign tour
[06:16] what? how can this be possible?
[06:20] why? Don't people go on honeymoon after wedding?
[06:24] I want to go to U.S. and meet my old friends. I want to hang out with them and have fun
[06:30] you have left your parents in tension
[06:32] and want to go on foreign tour?
[06:35] no, at least I'm not this inconsiderate
[06:38] this is their own tension. Why are you showing this sympathy
[06:44] because I spent a long time of my life without these relationships
[06:49] you are lucky
[06:52] that people who love you and care about you are present in this world
[06:58] ask me
[07:00] I don't have these relationships
[07:03] every moment
[07:04] I miss these relationships
[07:08] mother and father
[07:09] sister and brother
[07:11] cousins
[07:13] how much special these relationships are
[07:17] please, never take these relationships for granted
[07:21] never hurt your parents
[07:25] because in this world
[07:28] these people love us the most
[07:30] I don't believe that you are saying this all
[07:33] why?
[07:35] Am I not a human?
[07:38] You are forgetting that you encouraged me to run from my house
[07:43] and now you are blaming me for everything?
[07:46] that I betrayed my parents and hurt them?
[07:50] what's wrong with you
[07:51] yes, I am to blame with you
[07:55] this is why I have decided that we'll go to your parents today
[08:00] and apologize to them
[08:01] we aren't going anywhere. Let them stay worried until they don't realized their mistake
[08:09] and I took this step to teach them a lesson
[08:12] otherwise you aren't this important to me that I would have left my house for you
[08:34] I know it very well.
[08:37] You only used me for your reasons
[08:41] but remember it
[08:43] I'm also using you for my purpose
[08:46] and my purpose is one
[08:49] to become son in law of Safdar Kamal
[08:55] I feel that she wasn't interested in brother Raazi
[09:01] yes
[09:03] I don't know why this happened
[09:09] now see
[09:13] betrayals ..
[09:21] this is the game of fate that you two parted ways
[09:25] what is this fate. It separates two lovers
[09:39] I used to think so much about him. I used to think so wrong
[09:45] but trust me
[09:47] I saw love in his eyes for you
[09:50] and it was true love
[09:56] what's the use of all this?
[09:59] Faizan was written in my fate
[10:01] if I was at your place
[10:04] I would have told it to father clearly that I don't want to marry Faizan. I like someone else
[10:10] Are you gone mad?
[10:11] the situation I got married, didn't you see it?
I had no other way but to be patient
[10:18] Faizan was written in my fate
[10:21] Sister, we get true love only for once. And out of people's fear ..
[10:25] Enough! I don't want to hear anything on this topic
[10:28] I'm so sorry. I was just explaining
[10:32] I was consoling
[10:33] that .. he isn't like this
[10:37] He loves your truly. And I have seen it in your eyes
[10:41] You aren't happy with brother Faizan
[10:51] Also, the decision they took in rush
[10:55] He thought you'd live happily your life. Today when he saw you unhappy, he's regretting
[11:05] I have closed this chapter
[11:08] you too accept it
[11:50] I was thinking so wrong about him
[11:55] I thought so wrong but trust me, I saw love in his eyes for you. True love
[12:11] what's the use of all this now?
Faizan was written in my fate
[12:19] If I was at your place, I would have taken stand for myself
[12:29] I would have clearly told father that I don't want to marry Faizan. I like someone else
[13:03] What is this? He isn't home yet
[13:27] Good evening sister! How are you?
[13:29] you and here?
[13:32] Sherry isn't at home
[13:34] I know it. I told him
[13:37] I'll stay here today
[13:39] but it isn't appropriate for you to stay here in absence of Sherry
[13:43] why are you nervous? He's my best friend
[13:46] it was different before
[13:48] I live here now. And I don't like you coming here daily
[13:57] You are getting nervous as if you haven't met any man before
[14:01] I know open minded girls like you very well
[14:05] who don't care about dignity when they are running away from house.
[14:07] But since I'm here, their dignity is at risk
[14:10] just shut up and get lost
[14:14] why?
[14:16] what will you do?
[14:19] this is my best friend's house. I can come here and stay here anytime
[14:24] I don't need your permission. Understood?
[15:36] hello?
[15:37] Sherry, where are you?
[15:39] Why are you calling me again and again
[15:42] What does your friend Rizwan has to do here? Why does he come here in your absence?
[15:48] He was taunting me
[15:51] He was staring me oddly. Ask me not to come here again
[15:57] okay
[15:58] I will stop him. Anything else?
[16:02] when are you coming back home?
[16:05] I can't fly and come
[16:07] I will take some time
[16:09] I'm alone at home. I'm scared
[16:12] You weren't scared when you left home during midnight
[16:15] Are you saying this, Sherry? I left my house for you
[16:23] I have left my house in anger
[16:26] but I feel that I left all my courage back too
[16:31] and made a big mistake by trusting you
[16:34] fine! I'm sorry
[16:37] don't be angry
[16:39] look
[16:41] because I love you so much, I get worried when you are stressed
[16:46] I can't see you like this
[16:49] this is why I asked you to introduce me to your parents soon so that I could apologize and fix everything
[17:00] Please, don't you worry. I'm reaching in 10 minutes
[17:04] bye!
[17:18] you left home for me?
[17:20] You left home only out of your ego
[17:24] You only used me
[17:27] but I won't leave you this easily now
[17:31] you got married? Now fulfill it
[19:03] so this is your real face
[19:09] marriage with me, and affair with someone else?
[19:15] I will find out whoever it was. But to scare you, this recording is enough
[19:23] it will be fun when father would find it out that his pious daughter in law was involved in someone else
[19:41] now live like this
[19:45] and see what I'd do
[19:58] when did you come?
[20:00] I didn't find it out
[20:04] how will you know if you will stay lost in someone's dreams
[20:11] I mean you were having a deep sleep
[20:14] you can't know it
[20:18] when I came
[20:22] you'd be liking it that I come home late
[20:26] staying alone
[20:29] and staying lost in someone's memories
[20:33] do you like it?
[20:34] nothing
[20:36] You go to sleep. I have to talk to Ramsha
[20:39] She must be waiting
[20:44] what happened? Why are you looking at me like this?
[20:47] Ramsha is my girl friend
[20:49] you know this
[20:53] now you'll talk to her in my presence too?
[20:57] I will
[21:00] Isn't it good that I talk in your presence instead of having a secret affair?
[21:04] Any objection?
[21:05] Faizan, I'm your wife
[21:08] Don't you care about my feelings?
[21:11] no!
[21:15] Hadia, do you know?
[21:17] I'm a bad person, and I accept it
[21:20] but I'm not that bad that I'd have a secret affair with someone
[21:25] Whatever it is
[21:26] I do it openly
[21:29] I'm fearless
[21:31] I am same inside out. I'm not a hypocrite
[21:36] and I hate fake girls like you who wear a mask of decency
[21:43] what did I do?
[21:45] I didn't hide anything. I am what I am
[21:50] Really?
[21:53] You didn't hide anything?
[21:56] okay
[21:59] what is this?
[22:01] I saw love in his eyes for you
[22:04] and true love
[22:07] what's the use of this all?
[22:10] Faizan was written in my fate
[22:13] this is your reality?
[22:16] this is what you are?
[22:22] how innocent do you look. How clever you are
[22:26] Faizan
[22:27] it isn't like what you think
[22:31] You are thinking about your ex-lover while being married to me
[22:36] secretly at night, you cry for him.
[22:39] And I am so dumb that I couldn't find it that why isn't my rough behavior and betrayal effecting you
[22:50] do you know why?
[22:52] because I don't exist for you. I don't matter for you
[22:55] For God's sake Faizan, there is nothing like that
[23:00] this isn't true, believe me
[23:03] then what's the truth?
[23:07] who is it that you love?
[23:09] No one! I don't have anyone in my life other than you, trust me
[23:14] how do I believe it, Hadia. I saw and heard everything
[23:18] I swear there is no one in my life other than you
[23:24] right now?
[23:27] there was before?
[23:29] who was it? Tell me? I don't mind
[23:35] okay, just relax
[23:37] its life
[23:39] what's done is done
[23:42] actually, I'm a broad minded guy
[23:44] I don't have problem with little affairs
[23:48] but
[23:50] what will happen if father would find it out?
[23:53] it would be a problem for you and your family
[23:56] by the way, you can share your love story with me
[24:01] Faizan, listen to me
[24:02] Fine, whatever it is. I don't have a problem
[24:07] Faizan, how do I explain?
[24:09] by the way, I really want to meet the guy. Who is that lucky guy
[24:14] who loved you and you loved him?
[24:17] Enough! For God's sake, be quiet!
[24:20] how fun would it be when this video would be viral in front of mother and father, Hadia?
[24:24] And what if your parents have seen it?
[24:29] you won't be able to face anyone
[24:31] your sister just got engaged. What will happen, man?
[24:36] you won't do anything
[24:38] my dignity is yours too
[24:40] you should have thought it before
[24:44] I can die but I can't think about anyone but you, Faizan
[24:49] lets make a deal
[24:52] I'll keep your secrets, you keep mine
[24:56] You won't interfere in my matters, and I won't interfere in yours
[25:01] You shouldn't have any problem if I talk to you in any way. I won't have any with you
[25:09] You won't complain to father
[25:13] otherwise, it would be too bad
[25:51] Why are you worried, man?
[25:54] I'll return you every penny
[25:58] you brought her saying 2 days
[26:00] its been a whole week
[26:04] what is your plan?
[26:06] man
[26:08] I'd have to do something
[26:10] I am thinking to take her back to her house
[26:13] I don't have any other option
[26:16] do quickly what you want to
[26:18] you don't have much time
[26:20] If he will come back
[26:22] there would be a bigger problem
[26:26] you'd have to vacate this house before he comes
[26:31] otherwise it would be a problem for me
[26:35] you don't know Mr. Rizvi
[26:37] He will take a minute to kick me out of job
[26:41] I'll do something. Don't you worry
[26:44] Tell me one thing
[26:46] Will Natasha keep relationship with you after knowing your reality?
[26:50] her parents?
[26:52] would they make you their son in law?
[26:55] no man
[26:57] it isn't that easy
[26:59] I'd have to win their trust first
[27:02] Mr. Safdar is a dignified man
[27:05] he has a good social status. He has a big name
[27:09] he won't let his daughter to get divorced so soon
[27:13] anyways, after a while he'd have to forgive us
[27:24] Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Natasha?
[27:29] Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Where are you going?
[27:32] Leave my hand. I don't want to listen to you
[27:37] Natasha?
[27:38] What you heard is a half truth. I'll tell you the truth
[27:42] I don't trust you, Sherry. It was my biggest mistake to trust you
[27:48] Natasha, I didn't want to deceive you. I did everything to get you.
[27:52] Would you marry me if I had told you my status?
[27:55] Leave me. Give me divorce right now or else I'll get you locked up behind bars
[28:01] Natasha, I'm your husband. You can't do any such thing with me.
[28:04] Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Natasha? Natasha?
[28:24] I'm a broad minded person
[28:27] These little affairs don't effect me
[28:30] but ..
[28:32] what if others know?
[28:35] it would be a problem for you and your family
[28:39] by the way, you can share your love story with me
[28:54] how much fun would it be when this video would be viral and come in front of mom and dad.
[28:59] What about your old parents?
[29:03] you won't be able to face anyone
[29:06] and your sister has just got engaged. What will happen?
[29:36] why are you standing there?
[29:58] Are you worried?
[30:03] I won't tell anyone. Don't take tension
[30:07] Relax
[30:24] Natasha, listen to me?
[30:26] Stop following me, before I do something that you'll regret
[30:30] Natasha listen to me
[30:31] try to understand. It was a misconception
[30:33] leave my hand. You'll get papers in few days
[30:37] Please listen to me
[30:39] Leave me
[30:43] Natasha!
[31:10] hey
[31:25] why are you taking so much stress?
[31:29] you haven't slept properly since 3 nights
[31:37] how can a failed and unlucky father like me sleep?
[31:44] Please Safdar, don't talk like this
[31:48] you are giving me pain too by saying so
[31:52] you know that I can't see you in this condition
[31:57] please
[31:58] for me
[32:00] forgive Natasha
[32:02] she is your daughter
[33:08] There is no fracture, they are minor injuries
[33:13] then why isn't she coming into senses?
[33:17] that's the medicine. There is nothing to worry about
[33:22] we will discharge her till evening
[33:53] you keep this
[33:54] I'll give you more when the work is done
[33:56] I will say such emotional dialogues that she will forgive you and go with you
[34:02] now go
[34:20] we have to submit this all today
[34:52] hello?
[34:52] hello? Greetings! Is Faizan in office?
[35:02] No, Faizan hasn't come to office yet
[35:06] is everything fine?
[35:08] I want to talk important
[35:12] what is it Hadia?
[35:15] why do you seem worried? Is everything okay?
[35:17] Actually ..
[35:42] look Hadia
[35:44] He'll blackmail you now
[35:46] he'll threaten you and scare you
[35:50] but you don't need to come under pressure
[35:53] hmm?
[35:56] look, you didn't do anything wrong
[35:58] you didn't do a sin
[36:00] but I accepted that I used to like someone
[36:05] you used to like me
[36:08] not don't now
[36:13] look Hadia
[36:15] Every person has a past
[36:18] Faizan also has
[36:19] infact ..
[36:20] he still talks to his ex-girlfriend
[36:24] he meets her
[36:33] as far as our relationship is concerned
[36:37] it was a past
[36:39] it was a fantasy
[36:42] neither we had a relationship before nor have now
[36:45] what if he tells this to father?
[36:48] what respect would have I?
[36:50] how will I face my parents?
[36:53] Fizza is about to get engaged
[36:55] They can even end Fizza's engagement if they'd find it out
[36:59] No one can do anything. I'm telling you
[37:03] he can't do anything
[37:05] he's a coward
[37:07] how can a person blackmail his own wife?
[37:15] look .. look Hadia
[37:17] You and Fizza didn't take my name
[37:20] then why are you worried?
[37:22] don't you worry
[37:27] and as far as that video is concerned
[37:30] listen to me
[37:31] its an easy mission
[37:33] take his cellphone when Faizan is sleeping
[37:36] and delete that video when you get a chance
[37:44] Hadia?
[37:46] I'm telling you, you can do this
[37:52] I'm with you
[37:54] thanks
[37:56] okay!
