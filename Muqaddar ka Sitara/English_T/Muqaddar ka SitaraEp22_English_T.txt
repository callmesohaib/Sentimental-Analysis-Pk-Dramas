[01:17] Safdar, Razi has asked for some time to think.
[01:23] How much time does he want?
[01:25] Just a few days. He said he'll think and tell me.
[01:31] I want a positive answer.
[01:40] This is true that a person becomes very selfish for the love of his children.
[01:51] And I'm doing this now.
[01:57] I'm imposing my wishes and decisions on you.
[02:04] I am embarrassed, trust me.
[02:11] You're very close to my heart.
[02:14] I respect you very much but
[02:17] I'm helpless against my children.
[02:27] Natasha, my daughter is a little pampered.
[02:32] She isn't mature.
[02:38] If we see Razi opposite to her, he's a very sensible and stable boy.
[02:46] And I believe, he will be able to handle Natasha once they're married.
[02:53] Please don't let me down.
[02:59] Safdar I will try my best to make Razi agree.
[03:04] Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[05:01] Hello?
[05:03] Why don't you say yes to marrying Natasha?
[05:06] Did mom ask you to tell me this?
[05:08] Nobody said anything to me.
[05:12] I think this would be best for everyone.
[05:16] Your mother wants to see you happy. Why are you doing this because of me?
[05:24] See, we have nothing between us.
[05:30] Why do you mention me to her again and again and worry her?
[05:34] Why don't you forget me?
[05:36] I am trying, Hadia
[05:39] but I cannot waste my life trying.
[05:45] The life you're spending with Faizan,
[05:48] I cannot spend such a life with my partner.
[05:53] We only get one life, Hadia
[05:57] and marriage is a very important decision.
[06:02] I cannot destroy my life to make others happy.
[06:08] If you have a problem with me or you don't like me living there, I'll leave.
[06:16] I'll never want me to be the reason of trouble in your marriage life.
[06:22] Bye.
[07:01] See Natasha, I cannot convince your dad, alone. Its very difficult.
[07:07] He will insult me.
[07:09] You claimed you loved me and you couldn't live without me and today?
[07:15] What happened to you today?
[07:17] Its very difficult, in fact, its impossible to convince him.
[07:23] There is only one solution. If you want to marry me, we can get married in the court.
[07:28] Hello. I haven't lost my mind yet.
[07:31] And neither will I die without you that I'll get married to you in the court.
[07:39] See this will make convincing him easy.
[07:43] Dad will throw me out of the house. I cannot take such a big risk.
[07:49] You should wait. I'll talk to Razi.
[07:54] I'll insult him so much that he'll back out himself.
[08:00] Alright. We'll see.
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
[08:23] See dear, I have to answer Safdar in the morning. Tell me what should I answer him.
[08:30] Don't say anything to him. I'll tell him myself that I cannot marry her.
[08:35] Razi what is wrong with you?
[08:37] Why do you want to embarrass me in front of my brother?
[08:41] Mom, I don't like Natasha. I hate her.
[08:46] Alright.
[08:48] Its not important to like someone before you get married.
[08:52] You can fall in love after getting married as well.
[08:57] I'm a human being. I'm alive. I have some feelings. I have likes and dislikes.
[09:03] How can I marry Natasha? I cannot marry such a proud and ill mannered girl.
[09:10] God knows what happened that uncle wants me to marry Natasha, all of a sudden.
[09:18] I'm telling you clearly.
[09:20] I will not make a liberal girl like Natasha, my life partner.
[09:26] How could you even think that?
[09:29] No.
[09:31] Something has definitely happened
[09:33] and this is why uncle wants to dump Natasha on my head. But I'm telling you clearly.
[09:42] Even if he gives me all the wealth in the world, I will not marry Natasha, even then.
[09:50] And if that is so. Then its fine. I'll poison myself and die.
God forbid.
[10:03] Alright.
[10:06] Do whatever you want to do.
[10:30] I cannot marry such a proud and ill mannered girl.
[10:35] I don't know what happened all of a sudden that uncle wants me to marry Natasha.
[10:42] Its better that I poison myself and die.
[10:44] Then die!
[10:47] What does he think of himself?
[11:11] What do you think of yourself?
[11:14] You'll live in my house and assassinate my character and you expect me to be quiet?
[11:20] Even I don't want you to be quiet.
[11:24] Why don't you tell uncle you don't like me
[11:28] because I cannot marry you at any cost?
[11:36] See Natasha, we have two different perspectives.
[11:42] You're a broadminded girl and I cannot keep such a girl happy.
[11:48] I have repeatedly said no to him but uncle is pressurizing me.
[11:53] I cannot say no to him again and again. It looks bad.
[11:56] How would you reject me Razi? I reject you.
[12:02] You're right.
[12:04] You will do absolutely right.
[12:06] I think you should marry a boy of your status, like that guy, Nisar Ahmed.
[12:15] You were dreaming of marrying him.
[12:22] Its another thing that he rejected you and said yes for an ordinary girl.
[12:31] Whats the use of such status and wealth?
[12:36] that a guy like Nisar rejected you. He had zero interest in you.
[12:42] How dare you!
[12:47] See Natasha, I didn't want to hurt you.
[12:52] In fact I wanted to make you understand.
[12:54] But you said such things that I had to answer you.
[12:58] I'm not your enemy.
[13:00] I just dislike a few of your habits.
[13:04] See,
[13:07] I'm your cousin and as a cousin its my responsibility to advise you.
[13:13] I have a request. Get rid of your loafer friends.
[13:17] If you get rid of them, then..
Then what?
[13:23] Then no respectable guy in the world will marry you.
[13:26] You think if you say no to marrying me, nobody would marry me?
[13:34] Don't forget. I am Safdar Kamal's daughter. Remember this.
[13:48] Arrogant!
[14:04] Hello?
Hie.
[14:08] Natasha? Why are you crying?
[14:11] Dad wants me to marry that Razi.
[14:15] Then?
[14:17] Then I don't want to marry him.
[14:20] I don't care whether dad agrees or not. I'll only marry you.
[14:26] Yes but Natasha, your father will not accept me and what if he throws you out?
[14:34] He will not do this. He will be upset but nothing more. We'll make it up to him.
[14:43] Are you sure?
[14:45] Marriage is not a child's play.
[14:49] I mean, if your father doesn't agree, you'll lose your half of the wealth.
[14:54] I don't care. I honestly don't.
[14:59] I've decided. You come and pick me right now. I'm waiting for you.
[15:23] There must be some magic in my personality.. Rizwan..
[15:37] Hello? Yes Rizwan. I'm coming to your house.
[15:42] So late at night. Is everything alright?
[15:45] I have a breaking news.
You'll lose your senses if you hear it.
[15:51] What?
[15:52] I'm bringing Natasha to your house.
[15:54] We'll get married urgently in the morning.
[15:57] Wow. You trapped the fish real soon.
[16:00] Listen I'm coming to you.
[16:03] We'll keep her there for a few days and then I'll take her to her father's house to apologize
[16:10] See, her father isn't any ordinary man.
[16:14] Once I'm legally her husband, he'll not be able to do anything. 
[16:19] He wouldn't want to make a spectacle of himself in the society.
[16:22] Alright, I'm coming to you. We'll sit and talk. 
[16:27] I've gotten a good catch now. My days will change.
[16:34] Alright. Bye.
Alright. Okay.
[18:34] How do you like the house?
[18:40] Lets go.
[18:44] Sherry
[18:50] I have left everything for you. Please don't disappoint me.
[18:57] Never.
[19:00] Do you love me?
[19:04] Do you have any doubts?
[19:06] Will you ever leave me?
[19:09] Never.
[19:12] Don't worry. I'll show you the guest room, get some rest. 
[19:17] Then we'll prepare for the wedding. Come on.
[21:37] Why would Razi say no? He always wanted to be your son in law.
[21:42] Sheena you're forgetting. He said no earlier as well.
[21:48] He said no because the girl he liked turned him down.
[21:55] sister Sajida gave me a lot of hope.
[22:00] Let her be. She has always made sure that you know about her son's abilities, respect and loyalty.
[22:10] Why would Razi say no to marrying Natasha. He came here for this.
[22:15] What are you saying?
[22:18]  I trust my nephew more than I trust myself.
[22:24] He's my nephew and my blood cannot deceive me.
[22:29] You shouldn't be trusting someone so blindly. Its your own kin that deceives you at times.
[22:37] Dad, did Natasha go somewhere last night?
[22:41] No.
[22:42] Why? What happened?
[22:43] Actually Khalid is saying that she went somewhere last night. Someone came to pick her 
[22:48] what!
and she also had a suitcase.
[22:51] What? Where is she now?
[22:55] I don't know. She isn't home and her phone is off. 
[22:58] Khalid said that he went to get a drink of water at 3am. When he got back, the door was opened.
[23:31] She left. She insulted all of us and left. Your daughter.
[23:36] Don't worry. 
[23:38] I'll do something. I'll find her and bring her back.
[23:42] Whats the use? We cannot earn back lost respect. 
[23:46] She tainted us for life. I'll never forgive her, Sheena.
[23:52] Faizan you should go and find out. Ask any of her friends.
[23:57] I don't know any of her friends. Who should I ask?
[24:01] Uncle don't worry.
[24:06] I'll do something.
[24:07] No use Razi. She left with that boy and perhaps she's already married him.
[24:14]  Sheena, we've been destroyed.
[24:19] Uncle, don't worry. I'll hint up something and find out through her friends. 
[24:26] I'll call the police if needs be.
[24:29] Have you lost your mind?
[24:32] Do you know the meaning of informing the police? Disrespecting ourselves even further.
[24:40] We don't have any other option. Anybody can misuse her because of Safdar's status.
[24:49] We should hurry up before its late. They'll trace her though her mobile phone.
[24:56] You want me and my daughter to be disrespected in the entire city.
[25:03] Why would I want that, auntie?
[25:04] Keep your suggestions to yourself Hadia. 
[25:09] Did you call her? Try calling her.
[25:12] I tried a number of times but her phone is off. 
[25:18] Safdar this is all because of you. 
[25:21] Had you not insisted that she shall marry Razi, she wouldn't have left home.
[25:28] If something happens to my daughter, I'll never forgive you, your sister and your nephew.
[26:27] Everybody must know by now that I'm not home. 
[26:33] Oh God, what did I do?!
[26:49] I wanted to show Razi down and took such a big step. 
[26:55] Dad will be very angry. 
[26:58] He'll taunt mom for the rest of her life.
[27:02]  I didn't want that.
[27:05] I wouldn't have done this if dad had listened to me.
[27:10]  I was forced because of his cold attitude. 
[27:15] Now I'll not go there until he accepts Sherry as my husband.
[27:33] Good morning, sweetheart. 
[27:37] Your breakfast is ready. 
[27:40] Come eat.
[27:47] What happened? You look worried?
[27:51] I just feel that maybe I did something wrong in the heat of the moment.
[27:58] There's no use regretting now. 
[28:01] Come on finish your breakfast and we'll go to the court today and get married?
[28:09] Today?
[28:11] Yes. I was thinking, it'll be good if we can get this done, today only. 
[28:19] What happened? 
[28:21] Did you change your mind?
[28:27] Or are you scared? 
[28:30] Do you not trust me?
[28:32] Its not that Sherry. I'm just worried. My family would be worried for me.
[28:45] Alright, do one thing.
[28:48]  Turn on your phone and talk to your family. They'll be at peace then.
[29:13] Alright don't worry.
[29:14]  I'll take you to your parents once we're married and we'll apologize. Alright?
[29:25] Come on get up. Your breakfast is getting cold.  
[29:27] Come on. 
[29:33] In fact I'll feed you with my own hands.
[29:38] Come on.
[30:06] Should we go?
[30:15] I am scared.
[30:19] Don't be scared. You crossed the biggest hurdle 
[30:23] and now you're scared of going to court.
[30:27] I'm just scared that if dad doesn't accept our marriage.
[30:34] See Natasha. I know your parents will react intensely.
[30:41] Let some time go by. They'll forgive you. 
[30:44] Please bear it for a few days. See, I'm with you.
[31:44] I'm afraid Faizi. 
[31:47] What if someone kidnapped her?
[31:49] Nobody kidnapped her. She went on her own. Razi just showed the CCTV footage to dad. 
[31:55] be honest mom, who is this guy?
[32:00] Sherry. Her friend. 
[32:03] She must have run away with that boy, that wretched girl.
[32:06] Why did she have to run? 
[32:08] She could have told me or dad. What was the need to get us insulted by running like this?
[32:14] I'm a man and yet I married that ordinary girl Hadia. 
[32:18] Why did she have to run away?
[32:24] Natasha? Where are you? Where did you go? 
[32:30] You got married?
[32:34] Hello? What did you do?
[32:39] I didn't expect you to do this stupidity?
[32:41] What else could I do Faizi? Did I have an option? 
[32:47] Nisar rejected me and married that ordinary girl. 
[32:52] And dad? He held his engagement in our house.
[32:57] He wanted me to marry Razi without asking me. 
[33:01] When nobody cares for me why should I?
[33:10]  What if dad forced me to marry Razi?
[33:16] I mean its too stupid of me to explain to you that you cannot be forced to marry. 
[33:23] Your consent is needed. 
[33:27] But lets not argue on the phone. Come back.
[33:32] I'm not coming
[33:34] I have married Sherry 
[33:37] and now I'll only come back when dad calls us happily. 
[33:44] Sherry is my legal husband now. 
[33:47] All of you will have to accept him and if you don't, forget that I'll ever come back.
[33:54] Alright. 
[33:55] Don't come back. 
[33:57] Nobody needs you here.
[34:13] What did she say?
[34:15] She's not coming back.
[34:31] Where were you dear? I've been calling you.
[34:35] Mom, I'll call you later. There's a big problem in our house.
[34:39] What happened dear, what problem?
[34:42] Don't tell dad. Natasha left the house.
[34:46] Where did she go? 
[34:49] God please keep the child safe. 
[34:54] She's immature. 
[34:57] How are her father and mother?
[35:00] They're very angry.
[35:01] I'm scared they might do something.
[35:04] Should I call?
[35:06] No. Don't call and please don't tell dad.
[35:16] Alright, I'll call you later.
[35:18] Okay. Bye.
[35:29] What happened? Why are you quiet? Tell your family about everything that is happening. 
[35:38] You have a chance to ridicule my sister.
[35:42] Whats wrong with you? Why will I ridicule your sister?
[35:47] My respect is concerned with yours but my family would have known. 
[35:52] I talk to them and if I hadn't Safdar uncle might..
[35:56] Your family isn't so important that we tell them everything.
[36:02]  Just be careful next time.
[36:06] Nothing related to this house or me should be known by your family in Hyderabad.
[36:13]  I don't like people being involved in my family matters. 
[36:18] Be careful.
[36:25] Your family in Hyderabad calls a lot. 
[36:27] Ask them to lessen the frequency.
[36:55] I don't believe this. How could she do this?
[37:04] She didn't like Razi,
[37:08]  that's why she left the house. 
[37:12] She doesn't even love Sherry.
[37:19] How could she think everything?
[37:28]  She only wants to take revenge from you.
[37:34] She got married.
[37:37] She went away with him and you say she didn't like him.
[37:42] Please don't interfere. I have to see this day because of your son Razi.
[37:52] Safdar I'm telling you. She did this because she was angry and being stubborn. 
[37:58] Sherry wasn't so important that she would leave house for him. 
[38:03] She did this to get rid of Razi.
[38:09] I'm telling you.
[38:10] Everything is because of your wrong upbringing.
[38:22] How can you hold me at fault? 
[38:26] Don't you remember how persistent and stubborn she has been ever since she has been a child?
[38:36] I'll go and bring her back tomorrow.
[38:39] Its no use.
[38:43] She has left. Forget her.
[38:50] Forget her.
[38:51] She tainted us for our lives. 
[38:55] You're a mother that's why you're getting emotional, but I..
[39:01] I'll never forgive her.
