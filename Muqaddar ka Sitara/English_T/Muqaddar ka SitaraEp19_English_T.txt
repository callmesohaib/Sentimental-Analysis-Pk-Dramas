[01:09] Natasha look, now spit your anger & come outside
[01:14] what are you achieving by shutting yourself in the room & doing hunger strike?
[01:20] neither you had an emotional attachment, nor any relation or chat with Nisar. Then why are you angry?
[01:28] so when did I say that I like him? Or I am dying after him?
[01:34] I am angry on my insult
[01:38] I am unable to digest the fact that how come they have liked that girl in my comparison?
[01:47] what is her worth?
[01:49] she isn't beautiful than me
[01:52] then how come they have liked Fizza, mom?
[01:57] look, they have seen something for sure
[01:59] that's why, they have preferred her after leaving Safder Kamal's only daughter
[02:05] I've told you many times, to focus on your way of talking with  people
[02:11] try talking to people with soft & polite attitude like Hadia
[02:18] for the sake of show off
[02:21] but try improving yourself
[02:25] at least try a bit how your father wants you to be, Natasha
[02:31] look! your only quality shouldn't be that you are Safder Kamal's daughter
[02:37] there should be grace & attraction in your personality
[02:42] so that you can be praised in our entire circle
[02:45] and then you'll see that you will get so many suitors
[02:49] please mom! I cannot pretend like your daughter in law
[02:54] I am fine the way I am
[02:57] why should I change myself for the suitors? What is the need for me to change myself?
[03:03] and what do you think?
[03:05] they liked Fizza because of these qualities?
[03:11] Not at all!
[03:15] their son must be disobedient like yours
[03:18] because of whom they wanted an innocent & poor girl, whom they can dominate
[03:23] No! Nisar is not a licentious or disobedient guy
[03:29] everyone praises him for his attitude in the entire cirlce
[03:33] that's why we wanted him to become our son in law
[03:37] but now its Mr. Aleem's fate
[03:39] he got a lottery. He must be so happy
[03:44] there isn't any such thing
[03:49] neither we are happy nor we are proud
[03:54] marriage are based upon fate
[03:58] our dad had never wished to wed us off in palaces
[04:04] he had always preferred honor over wealth
[04:08] oh really!
[04:09] that's why your father had wed off his dearest & wise daughter with a licentious & rich guy
[04:17] what's the big deal in it, mom?
[04:19] he is the only son of a rich father
[04:23] its not a bad deal, right sister?
[04:25] its your delusion
[04:27] this marriage didn't happen on my father's wish, but it had happened upon Safder uncle's insistence
[04:34] and Faizan's reality was kept as a secret from us before marriage
[04:38] if my parents had an idea about his bad deeds, then they wouldn't have wed me off over here ever
[04:44] no matter Faizan is licentious, but he is far more better than you
[04:49] if you wouldn't have got married to Faizan
[04:51] then you would have been sitting in some school's master's house, like your father
[04:57] rich guys doesn't have any scarcity of beautiful girls
[05:02] even today every beautiful girl is after my son
[05:07] not on him! but on his father's wealth
[05:11] and I am not among those girls who runs after money
[05:18] but still I will try my best to fix Faizan
[05:22] not because I am his wife & its my duty
[05:26] in fact, because he is Safder uncle's son
[05:31] and I respect him a lot
[05:35] I respect him like a father
[05:38] and I had promised my father
[05:42] that I will never give any chance to complain to Safder uncle
[05:46] I will fulfill all his expectations
[05:51] and in order to fulfill that promise, I am present in this house today
[05:57] and don't you worry
[06:01] my father will not marry his daughter at such a place
[06:05] where his friend will be hurt, if he ties relations with them
[06:20] now leave your anger, & have food as you haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[06:33] did you see?
[06:34] your father liked all these cruelties
[06:39] learn something from her
[06:41] this naive attitude, simplicity etc
[06:44] the parents of Pakistani guys like such things
[06:47] please, I don't need to impress anyone's parents
[06:52] next time if you seek any proposal for me, then make sure that he doesn't have parents
[06:57] he should be orphan, but rich & only son
[07:01] I don't like big families
[07:04] these in-law tantrums! I can't handle it
[07:09] now don't talk rubbish! Eat your food
[07:21] you know I love you right?
[07:23] Hadia cannot take your place
[07:28] what's the big deal if she came into my house, but only you are there in my heart
[07:32] and I promise, you will always be there
[07:35] No, don't even think of coming here
[07:39] first of all I want to earn my dad's trust & then I have to take over his business. And its very important for me
[07:50] Ramsha, try to understand. Its a big decision for me, & I cannot take it like that
[07:54] understand my position, nobody will accept this marriage
[07:59] leave dad, nobody else will accept it
[08:03] listen! right now I have nothing, its all of dad's
[08:11] Rmsha, I cannot take a stand right now. Please understand, Ok?
[08:25] I'll talk to you later, Ok... bye!
[08:31] you have to email these inspection reports of all the 3 restaurants to uncle, but...
[08:36] maybe you are very busy in your girl friends & their problems
[08:45] it seems that you are habitual of eavesdropping like your mother & sister
[08:52] they are at home
[08:55] and you are here in office
[08:59] Razi, listen to me very carefully
[09:04] the way my father gives you so much of importance
[09:08] its not because he loves you or considers you as his son
[09:13] he is using you
[09:16] he is taking advantage of you
[09:20] the day I take over all of this
[09:23] and started to run this business, that day you will learn your worth
[09:30] leaving office
[09:34] you won't get a place in our house as well
[09:37] even I don't want to live in such a house, Faizan
[09:41] what is the benefit of staying in such a house
[09:44] where people's heart is more harder than stone
[09:53] and for your kind information, Mr, Faizan
[10:01] I haven't come here on uncle's recommendation
[10:05] uncle had insisted me for this work
[10:09] in fact, the place where I was working. I was very happy & Satisfied
[10:15] what to do
[10:17] when a person's child proves to be worthless
[10:21] then he has to trust on a person like me
[10:28] anyways..
[10:36] are you really in love with that girl?
[10:41] what was the need for you to ruin Hadia's life?
[10:47] but no
[10:49] you need this property too
[10:53] you cannot afford the luxuriousness with girls without money
[11:01] Faizan
[11:03] no girl in this world will cater you without money, even if its Ramsha
[11:13] you really need to shut up Razi
[11:18] why you did this?
[11:22] fortunately if you have got a girl like Hadia
[11:27] then why are you doing this?
[11:29] Hadia doesn't deserve all this
[11:37] Faizan look
[11:39] there is still time
[11:41] tell uncle clearly & rectify your mistake, what if it gets too late
[11:46] what if a nice girl like Hadia leaves your life
[11:53] enough!
[11:55] enough of your rubbish!
[11:58] who gave you the right to talk in my personal matters!
[12:03] yes
[12:05] you are right
[12:07] who am I?
[12:10] its your personal matter
[12:15] its your life, spend it in whatever manner you want to
[12:17] but listen to me very carefully, Faizan
[12:24] I am giving you some time
[12:28] I will not allow you to play with Hadia's life anymore
[12:39] what if..
[12:42] I tell uncle about yours & Ramsha's entire love story
[12:52] you need to get out, Raazi
[12:55] right now!
[12:59] do think about it
[13:21] I need water in my office
[13:23] right away
[13:50] greetings aunty!
[13:54] greetings to you too! How come you are here? Have you come alone?
[13:58] actually my class ended a bit early & I was missing my sister so I came to meet her
[14:03] where is she?
[14:05] she is at home, inside her room. You may go
[14:09] Okay
[14:10] by the way, you've completely changed after coming to Karachi
[14:15] earlier, you used to wear head scarf but now you are wearing a scarf around your neck
[14:21] no aunty, actually I used to wear the scarf like this earlier as well
[14:25] hmm... and by the way, a person should always groom themselves
[14:30] and now you are getting proposals from rich families, look at your sister
[14:34] even after becoming the daughter in law of such a big family, she doesn't have a bit of fashion sense
[14:39] teach her something
[14:42] yes, shall I leave?
[14:44] yes, go.. now you will keep visiting
[14:47] since you've moved to Karachi
[14:49] yes
[14:51] greetings!
[14:59] why she came here?
[15:03] how dare she to come here?
[15:06] talk softly she will hear you. Her sister lives here, why she won't come?
[15:10] this is my father's house! Go, tell her
[15:13] if she likes to meet her sister, then she may call her to her house
[15:20] what is the need to come here on regular basis?
[15:36] surprise!
[15:39] how come you came here? All alone?
[15:41] yes! in an auto rickshaw
[15:43] why?
[15:45] because I am not a coward like you, that's why. I can come all alone
[15:49] mom was right
[15:51] you've changed a lot after coming to Karachi. And you know how to make talks
[15:55] really! so mom talks such things about me?
[16:00] Ok sit, let me ask them to make tea for you
[16:02] in fact, its lunch time. Lets have lunch together
[16:04] No, no... sit here
[16:07] sister, I don't want to eat lunch. I've already done
[16:11] sit with me for a while, I want to talk to you so much
[16:20] what happen, why are you crying?
[16:23] has someone said something to you?
[16:26] nobody has said anything
[16:29] I met you after so many days
[16:31] so I got a bit emotional after seeing you
[16:35] even I miss you a lot
[16:38] do you know
[16:40] mom & dad are so worried for you
[16:44] why?
[16:45] I haven't complain them about anything
[16:49] its not necessary that every time one shall complain with their mouth
[16:55] sometimes, a lot is said without saying
[16:59] and then the behavior of your in-laws
[17:05] there isn't any such thing. You guys are having a misunderstanding
[17:09] yes, aunty is a bit nosy and...
[17:12] Natasha is blunt, she says whatever is there in her heart
[17:15] but they are not bad at heart
[17:19] and brother Faizan?
[17:21] he is also very nice, he has started to take good care of me'
[17:25] don't worry for me
[17:29] whatever it is, sister
[17:31] my heart doesn't accepts this
[17:34] it doesn't seem by looking at you that you belong ton this family
[17:52] yes, greetings!
[17:55] I am absolutely fine
how are you brother Rahman, & how is your wife?
[18:02] they have refused?
[18:04] but why?
[18:07] what can I say?
[18:10] anyways, I will try my level best to convince them
[18:17] Ok, tell Nisar not to cancel his flight I...
[18:21] I will let you know within few days after talking to him
[18:25] Ok
[18:27] bye!
[18:36] Farwa, do one thing
[18:39] make me a cup of tea, I am having headache
[18:44] why didn't you tell me earlier? I would have given you a head massage
[18:47] greetings, sister!
[18:48] greetings to you too!
[18:50] where is Shina?
[18:52] she has gone to the parlor with Natasha
[18:55] Okay, and where is Hadia?
[18:59] her sister is here, so she is with her
[19:02] hmm.. Ok. Sister, I am going to get freshen up
[19:05] yes yes
[19:07] why didn't you tell me earlier, I would have given you a head massage
[19:09] leave it, just get me some tea
[19:12] Okay
[19:13] by the way, tell me something. Why you gave my number to Nisar?
[19:17] although you know that dad had rejected that proposal
[19:21] because I want you to take your life's decision yourself
[19:25] yes sister, but dad had already rejected that proposal and...
[19:30] you know the reason behind rejection
[19:32] I think dad did wrong
[19:37] in order to save my marriage, he had rejected such a good guy like Nisar
[19:45] dad have to reconsider his decision
[19:48] what do you think, dad has rejected this proposal just to save your marriage?
[19:55] he had rejected so that Safder uncle doesn't get upset
[19:59] and not just because he is your father in law
[20:02] its because he is dad's really good friend
[20:06] and dad doesn't want anything to come in between his & uncle Safder's friendship
[20:16] how can a person wed off his daughter, by upsetting his such a good & loyal friend
[20:24] sister look, we can get a lot of suitors
[20:28] but dad & Safder uncle's friendship is very precious
[20:33] God forbid if it got stained by any suspicion
[20:39] then dad will be shattered badly
[20:48] that's why dad got his dearest daughter married to his son without even thinking
[20:54] otherwise, just tell me there is a lot of difference in you & brother Faizan
[21:00] whatever it is, I just realize one thing
[21:05] no matter how rich a person becomes in this world
[21:08] they cannot write their children fate
[21:23] anyways, leave this topic. Tell me, tomorrow is a weekend
[21:28] when are coming to our house?
[21:30] I am going to Hyderabad, & you will come along with me. Ok?
[21:34] I cannot promise, but I will try my level best
[21:37] promise?
[21:40] thank you!
[21:41] how are your studies going?
[21:43] its going very well
[21:45] I've made new friends in the hostel, I enjoy in the university
[22:30] when they have rejected then what is the need for you to go there to convince them?
[22:35] how are you concerned with all these matters?
[22:37] they have refused because I was upset
[22:40] he had always sacrificed for me & my friendship. And I...
[22:44] I was being suspicious about him
[22:46] I have to convince brother Aleem at any cost
[22:49] otherwise, my conscious will keep criticizing me for life time
[22:53] and your daughter will never forgive you
[22:56] she will never tolerate that Nisar's wedding gets fixed with Fizza
[23:00] then tell her how to tolerate!
[23:02] you need to advise her how to tolerate, if you cannot do that then ask her to learn it from Hadia
[23:07] how she tolerates every bitter words of yours & your son's
[23:12] as far as Fizza is concerned
[23:14] her marriage will be fixed with Nisar at all cost, in fact her engagement
[23:17] I will do her engagement ceremony in my house
[23:19] what!
[23:20] yes!
[23:21] because brother Aleem did so many favors on me
[23:25] and now its my turn
[23:27] I won't let him lose such a good suitor
[23:29] try to think about your daughter ever, like a father
[23:33] you are doing injustice with her
[23:35] she is my daughter, the piece of my heart
[23:39] how can I do injustice with her, Shina?
[23:41] she is the piece of my heart, that's a different matter that she is disobedient
[23:44] I've talked to the city's biggest marriage bureau
[23:47] you'll get a suitor as per your expectations & status
[23:50] wait for a few days!
[23:52] please! and till then keep your mouth shut
[24:57] mom
[24:59] mom, Uncle Safder is here from Karachi. Dad has asked to do preparations for lunch
[25:03] Ok, come... let's meet him first
[25:07] hey Safder, what is the matter? you came in such a hurry, tell me what would you like to eat?
[25:12] No, brother Aleem there is no need to do any formality
[25:15] actually I want to talk sister in law about something important, so please call her
[25:20] greetings!
greetings to you, brother
[25:23] please sit
yes
[25:28] sister, the reason behind coming here to apologize to you from the bottom of my heart
[25:34] for what?
[25:35] believe me, I wasn't aware of what happened at my house yesterday
[25:42] but yes, I am amazed that you have rejected such a nice proposal
[25:48] brother Aleem, Mr. Rehman is a very old friend of mine
[25:52] and I know him, he is such a pious man
[25:55] and his son is a very well educated guy
[26:01] he is an intelligent guy. You guys could have taken my suggestion atleast
[26:10] their family background is quite religious, I mean
[26:14] I am sure that our daughter Fiza will stay very happy there
[26:18] I can guarantee you, you can handover your daughter to her with closed eyes
[26:23] I'm sure that they are very nice & respectable people
[26:31] but...
[26:33] we think that it would be better if they shall fix their son's marriage in a family as per their status
[26:44] maybe our daughter won't be able to adjust there
[26:47] what do you think?
[26:52] your daughter Hadia isn't happy in my house?
[26:56] No brother, this is not the matter
[27:02] actually the reality is that
[27:05] Hadia had told us that you guys are interested in Nisar for Natasha, that's why
[27:15] even Fiza is like my daughter
[27:22] what do you think that ..
[27:26] if they will like Fiza & reject Natasha, so I will mind it?
[27:30] do you think that I am like that?
[27:36] No Safder this is not the matter but..
no ifs or buts, brother Aleem
[27:42] they are coming on next Sunday for an engagement, just start your preparations
[27:49] both of the children will get married. I've decided, please!
[27:55] and one more thing, sister
[27:59] I will do Fizza's all arrangements myself
[28:02] I've got such a big team of my restaurant, we'll do the function somewhere. Its not an issue
[28:06] brother, how is this possible? What will people say?
[28:09] what about people, sister?
[28:11] let them say
[28:13] just look at your happiness & others ease
[28:18] sister, their friends circle is really big
[28:20] mostly his friend circle & relatives lives in Karachi, & for them coming over here. Please
[28:27] don't delay this, just proceed with it. Trust me
[28:31] everything will be fine, brother Aleem
[29:05] Safder has put me in an ambiguity once again
[29:10] I can't say anything about you
[29:14] you've agreed so quickly
[29:19] you didn't took time to think at Hadia's time, and same goes with Fizza
[29:26] you've agreed so quickly
[29:28] and...
[29:30] how did you agree to do the engagement ceremony at his house?
[29:35] you didn't let me say anything, also you stayed quiet too
[29:41] sister in law is not happy with this
[29:49] you shouldn't have said yes
[29:52] he had talked with such an honor, that I couldn't refuse
[30:03] you haven't learn to refuse
[30:07] I am worried that how will sister Shina react on this matter
[30:15] did you talk to Fizza?
[30:19] yes, yesterday I had a word with her
[30:23] So... doesn't she have an objection?
[30:29] we haven't given her an option to do an objection
[30:33] you've said yes on every word of brother Safder's
[30:37] you stayed quiet in front of Mr. Rehman, & agreed on everything
[30:42] now tell Hadia to come tomorrow
[30:46] also ask brother Safder too
[30:48] he can come if he has time
[30:51] I think it would be difficult for Safder to come but...
[30:55] Faizan will bring Hadia
[30:59] Faizan will come here?
[31:01] who had said this to you?
[31:03] look, Safder had told me that Faizan will bring Hadia
[31:08] in fact, he has promised that it will happen this way
[31:21] its out of question that I go there & that too with Hadia
[31:24] no way!
[31:26] Faizan, your dad is insisting
[31:30] if you can refuse him then go & talk to him
[31:33] I don't want to talk to him about anything
[31:35] Besides, its not an engagement just a formal ritual. There is no purpose of going there
[31:38] Faizan, please go today
[31:40] make your father happy for some time
[31:44] Besides, there is no need to go to the engagement ceremony as the function is going to happen at our house
[31:51] what!
[31:55] how can that girl's engagement ceremony happen in our house? How can dad agree to this?
[32:02] what do you mean?
[32:03] the entire proposal got fixed upon his insisting
[32:08] because brother Aleem had already refused
[32:10] they will refuse?
[32:12] its a lottery ticket for them, why would they refuse?
[32:15] by the way I don't get it
[32:17] how do they trap the parents of such rich guys?
[32:22] and mom, why didn't you stop him?
[32:25] only if somebody will listen to me
[32:28] there isn't any importance or value of my words
[32:32] I don't understand, why is he doing all this?
[32:34] a girl's family whom I don't give any importance, he is doing that family's function in this house
[32:40] he is doing a lot for this family, I don't understand why!
[32:43] nobody from us will attend the function, Faizan you too!
[32:47] whatever
[32:49] Faizan, I've already promised your father that you'll go this time
[32:54] you have promised him, so you may go. But I am not going
[32:57] Faizan, listen to me
Faizan
[33:13] how shall I contact him?
[33:15] his phone is coming to be switched off
[33:18] do one thing, send Hadia along with the driver
[33:24] what!
[33:26] the driver isn't there?
[33:29] Ok, let me do something
[33:35] uncle, this is the final report so please check it once
[33:40] yes dear, I will look into it. Do one thing
[33:42] go home, as you need to take Hadia to Hyderabad
[33:46] neither Faizan or driver is present in the house
[33:51] but uncle, I?
[33:53] yes dear, you
[33:55] Besides, few guests are coming to see Fizza so..
[33:58] do one thing, come back with Hadia as soon as their guests leave
[34:03] Ok
[34:04] thank you dear!
[34:19] yes mom, don't worry. I will be there on time
[34:22] Faizan must be here anytime
[34:25] it seems he is here. Ok, I am leaving, bye!
[34:34] maam Hadia
yes
[34:35] sir is waiting for you inside the car
[34:37] you go, I am coming
Ok
[35:38] thank you so much Faizan, mom & dad will be so happy...
[35:45] you!
[35:49] actually Faizan was busy somewhere
[35:54] so uncle had sent me to drop you to Hyderabad
[35:58] but why you?
[36:00] dad must have asked any driver
[36:02] you are right
[36:05] maybe, there wasn't any driver available
[36:09] therefore I had to come
[36:14] shall we go?
[36:16] wait a minute
[36:19] what happen, don't you want to go?
[36:30] let's go now
[37:27] can you please sit in the front?
[37:31] the journey is very long and...
[37:34] a lot of problems can come on the way
[37:37] if you will come in the front then
[37:48] actually I wanted to talk to you about something important
[37:51] maybe this way I won't be able to say it
[37:55] please come in the front so that I can tell you in detail
[38:00] but I don't want to talk to you about anything
[38:03] it would be better if you focus on your driving
[38:07] Hadia, I think there is a misunderstanding in between us
[38:13] and I think, we should remove this misunderstanding
[38:17] but I don't think any such thing
[38:20] Besides, we need to remove misunderstandings where we have a relation
[38:25] and we don't have any relation
[39:06] please, at least care about my respect
[39:12] no matter if we don't have a direct relation
[39:15] or close relation, but we had a relation
[39:19] please come out for its sake
[39:26] brother, park the car over there if you don't want to go inside
[39:30] yes
[39:31] Please
[39:37] Please
[39:49] mom, he has gone to Hyderabad
[39:53] he will come by night
[39:56] Razi should have refused. Safder asked him & he had gone
[40:01] you know, he doesn't say "No" to uncle
[40:07] and you gave this order to him
[40:09] my heart fears that there will be a storm in the house, if anyone gets a hint
[40:16] mom, nothing as such was there in between both of them
[40:19] it was a temporary attraction, which ended after sister Hadia's wedding
[40:25] Besides, they are living here since quite a long time. Has anyone got to know anything?
[40:29] but still
[40:31] but still its not appropriate for both of them to go together
[40:34] the same way its not appropriate for us to live here, but we are living here
[40:38] as uncle's puppets
[40:41] honestly speaking, even you cannot say "no" to uncle. And you've made brother follow the same habit
[40:47] according to me the entire fault is of uncle's
[40:50] why he had sent sister Hadia with a young stranger guy?
