[01:23] Hello, greetings mother, how are you?
Greetings to you too. I'm fine and how are you?
[01:29] I'm fine as well.
I was missing you...
[01:35] I wanted to meet you, but I don't think it's appropriate to visit you.
What are you saying? You can come whenever you want.
[01:42] I miss you too. I miss you and father.
[01:49] No, it's not a good thing to visit one's daughter at their in-laws frequently. How is Faizan?
[01:57] He's fine, and he has resumed his studies as well.
[02:05] Why has he started studying?
He didn't complete his degree, and that's why he rejoined the university.
[02:13] But... Hadia, was handling brother Safdar's business, right?
[02:18] Yes, he was... but now he wants to complete his studies.
[02:24] That's very strange.
Why?
[02:27] Meaning, why does he want to study now?
[02:30] He's not alone. He has your responsibility as well.
[02:34] Mother, don't worry. He is handling all of his responsibilities very well.
[02:39] And, he takes care of me as well.
[02:42] Alright, that's good. May God always keep you happy like that.
[02:52] I'll talk to you later.
Okay... farewell
[02:56] Take care...
Farewell.
[03:04] Thank God.
[03:28] I don't understand, how come you're so relaxed. We don't have much time Ramsha darling.
[03:35] You have to cheer up Faizan, no matter what.
[03:39] I think I'll have to tell you a way to cheer him up.
[03:43] No mother, I know all the ways. The training you gave me, lacks nothing.
[03:50] But... I don't think Faizan will agree so easily.
[03:56] He won't marry me in secret. He's a cowardly man.
He's a coward because you didn't make him brave.
[04:05] Listen to me, use your love and attention to manipulate him into spending most of his time with you.
[04:15] Attach him to yourself so that he doesn't think of anything but you.
[04:21] Relax, mother, everything will be fine, what's the rush?
I'm rushing because if you don't marry Faizan quickly...
[04:30] then it will be hard for me to refuse Mr. Razzaq.
[04:34] Don't say that old man's name in front of me. I hate that old man.
[04:39] Don't forget that it's been a long time since we've taken that loan from that old man. I don't have it in me to pay back that loan.
[04:47] He's pleading with me to get you married to him.
[04:51] He told me that he'll forget about the loan as soon as you marry him. And that bungalow in defense...
[04:56] he will transfer it to you.
Forget about that bungalow, even if he transfers all his possessions to me...
[05:01] even then I will not marry that old man, understand?
Then you have to convince Faizan to marry you.
[05:10] Otherwise, it would cause me much pain to see you going into that hell.
[05:30] I will read the emancipation papers, but that does not have any religious standing. Natasha can get a lawyer and take her share of the inheritance.
[05:39] I know.
[05:42] I also know that my daughter will go to that extent.
[05:48] And I also know that man...
[05:52] is behind all this. He wants...
[05:57] to get to my wealth through Natasha. But I will not let him succeed.
[06:04] No matter how wayward a child becomes, they cannot be deprived of their inheritance.
[06:11] That doesn't mean that children can keep making mistakes without expecting punishment from their parents.
[06:18] She should be punished.
You're angry right now. Don't make any decision in haste...
[06:23] that you would regret later. Think about it again and I'll visit you again.
[06:31] Allow me to leave now.
Farewell*
[06:52] What is all this uncle?
[06:56] Do you have any idea what you're doing?
[07:03] Uncle...
[07:06] For God's sake, take back your decision.
[07:10] I know that Natasha made a mistake, but it doesn't mean that you should punish her in this way.
[07:18] Children make mistakes.
[07:23] Children have rights as well.
[07:26] Do only children have rights?
Think about this calmly.
[07:32] What will the people say when they learn of emancipation in the news? Everyone will be aware of it then.
[07:42] I must punish her to teach her a lesson.
Uncle...
[07:47] this decision of yours will not solve this problem. Rather it will make it worse.
[07:54] Think about it calmly.
[07:58] Natasha is a US citizen. That man can run away with her to America, do you get that?
[08:06] What will you do then?
He intended to join himself with Natasha...
[08:12] and gain American nationality. But this is only possible if she has an American passport.
[08:19] Without a passport, one cannot travel.
[08:25] I burned Natasha's passport a long time ago.
[08:31] Because I learned of that man's true intentions.
[08:36] I won't let him...
[08:39] succeed at any cost.
[08:42] She should be punished.
[08:52] You told me that you find out about this and look at the CCTV footage. Take some help from Razi.
[08:58] What's the matter with you? Do you know what it means to tell Razi?
[09:03] He's my biggest enemy in this house. On top of that, he spies on me as well.
[09:07] He has taken my place at work and he wants to defame me in my home as well. I don't trust him, don't tell him.
[09:12] He tells father everything.
You have nothing to do with this, then why are you afraid?
[09:21] Were you suspecting me?
[09:25] No, I wasn't suspecting you.
[09:27] Then what was that? I know what you meant to say...
[09:33] I'm sorry I asked you to keep your things safe...
[09:40] My wife thinks that I stole her necklace!
[09:45] Faizan, it's nothing like that.
How could you think that I would steal your necklace?
[09:52] Who do you think I am? This house and this entire property are mine! What will I do to steal that ordinary necklace?
[10:00] Faizan, you have it wrong. It's nothing like that.
How is it then? You're driving me crazy! What's the worth of that necklace?
[10:07] Ten... twenty... fifty lacs? How much?
It's not about the money. You know how precious it was to me!
[10:13] I know your mother gave it to you, and it was not special. I'll buy a similar one for you!
[10:49] I'm sorry.
[10:56] Sorry
[11:14] I shouldn't have talked to you like that. I shouldn't have screamed.
[11:22] Whatever happened, we can't tell my parents about this. They'll react very badly.
[11:30] Don't tell your parents as well. They'll worry for no reason.
[11:46] I wish I could say that I would buy you fifty sets similar to that necklace, but I don't have anything like that right now.
[11:56] Father has taken away my salary, I only have my pocket money and we have to get by with that.
[12:11] Hadia, I promise...
[12:14] Soon, I will do a lot of things for you.
[12:18] I promise I will fulfill all your wishes.
[12:25] I spent my entire life like this. I didn't care for anyone...
[12:33] But I care for you...
[12:38] And I'm changing only for you.
[12:41] I want some time and that's it.
[12:49] Will you give me some time?
[13:00] Please.
[13:31] Uncle, I've researched everything about Sherry. He lives in an ordinary flat.
[13:40] His friends aren't good as well.
[13:44] He's a two-bit man.
That means that man has no job.
[13:50] Yes, uncle, you're right. There is a shop that provides him with enough money to pay rent.
[13:57] Shina was telling me that his parents died.
He's lying...
[14:03] His parents separated...
[14:07] In fact, because of his fraudulent behavior, his parents shoved him out of their home.
[14:12] His grandmother raised him.
[14:15] Shereyar is a man with a loose character.
[14:21] It's his job to hang out with scoundrels and entrap girls.
Razi, do something...
[14:30] Trace his home address. Send him a legal notice. As soon as he sees the emancipation papers, he will distance himself from Natasha.
[14:43] And Natasha's eyes will open as well.
Uncle...
[14:49] you're my elder, you always make the right decisions. But I have a request...
[14:55] It would be better if you save Natasha from Shery and bring her back home.
[15:02] She chose him, now let him suffer.
Uncle, how can you do this?
[15:10] She's your only daughter, please...
[15:17] How can you punish her like this?
She chose this punishment.
[15:23] She went on paths I asked her not to tread.
[15:28] She's not the only one to blame. Shina...
[15:33] is equally responsible for it. I tried making them understand a million times...
[15:39] but they didn't listen to me.
[15:44] It's better...
[15:46] that this happens. This way she won't ever do something like this again.
That will only make her more rebellious.
[15:57] You know very well that she's a stubborn girl. If she looks at the legal notice...
[16:04] then I think she'll be more worried.
Thank you for your advice...
[16:10] but a father always makes the best decision for his children.
[17:01] Thank God that she didn't discuss the necklace thing with father.
[17:19] It would have been troublesome, but she will tell her father, and if not, then she will surely tell her parents.
[17:28] I don't know what to do. I need to do something to keep her silent.
[18:02] Ramsha, I told you not to call me at this hour.
[18:05] So what am I called? I was missing you.
[18:09] You could have messaged me that. Don't call me again at this hour, Hadia is with me. It was hard for me to make her believe that we are over.
[18:20] You never feared her before, so what has happened now?
[18:24] I'm not scared of her, I just need to be careful, I told you this before.
[18:58] The weather is beautiful and I'm bored here. Let's go on a long drive, it's been a long time since we've been on a long drive.
[19:06] Long drive... sure I should do that so my father shoves me out of my home.
[19:12] I'm worried and you want to go on a long drive.
[19:18] You have no idea what I've done to make you happy. I stole my wife's necklace and that was such a strange thing to do.
[19:27] What?
[19:29] So that necklace was stolen?
[19:38] Liar! Fraud!
[19:41] You gifted me your wife's stolen necklace! What do you think of me? I'm not that deprived!
[19:52] I just hate you... I hate you... don't ever show me your face ever again!
[19:59] The notes are very important, be sure to bring them tomorrow.
[20:05] Bye.
[20:10] Hadia?
[20:17] What are you doing here at this hour?
I was talking to my friend. I thought you were asleep, why did you get up?
[20:22] When I opened my eyes, I saw you weren't there, so I came here.
[20:27] So you decided to spy on me, to see who I was talking to.
No Faizan, that wasn't my intention.
[20:33] I didn't ask for an explanation. What's wrong with you? Why don't you understand what I say?
[20:40] You suspect me in everything and you don't believe me. See for yourself who I was talking to.
[20:46] I was talking to Ramis, he's a university mate, and we were talking about notes.
[20:51] I didn't talk to him inside because you were sleeping and I didn't want to disturb you.
[20:55] I mean...
[21:26] See... I told you that it was a stolen necklace. Admit that your mother is very perceptive.
[21:36] I can predict the most unusual of things.
What should I do now? I want to throw that necklace at this face!
[21:45] Who does he think I am? Am I so deprived that I would wear his wife's hand-me-downs?
[21:51] That too which is stolen.
Calm down drama queen, no need to be so emotional.
[21:58] It is an expensive necklace. It will be no less than fifty lacs.
[22:04] There is no need to return it.
[22:05] Faizan is worried. She fears that if Hadia tells his father, he will be the first one that his father suspects.
[22:14] To drive away Faizan's suspicion I have an idea. Ask Faizan to make her a fake copy of that necklace. This will drive away Hadia's suspicion.
[22:28] She's not a child who can't distinguish between real and fake. Nor is she from a poor family...
[22:34] Her father owns a lot of land. And her parents gifted her that necklace.
Then ask Faizan...
[22:43] to go to our jeweler. He's a master at making fake jewelry. If he takes Hadia with him, Hadia won't suspect anything and this will be over.
[22:55] That's not a bad idea, I'll call Faizan right now.
[23:05] Is it ringing?
[23:10] Hello Faizan, I have an idea...
[23:14] Take Hadia to our jeweler. He'll make a fake copy of that necklace and Hadia won't suspect anything.
[23:21] I'll send you the address and number of the jeweler. Don't worry about that, I'll handle the rest.
[23:28] Okay bye...
It's sorted, right?
[23:32] Mother, you are great!
[23:35] Admit that your mother is a genius.
Faizan will Hadia a fool like I'm making Faizan.
[23:50] Faizan, come breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry, I'll eat at the university.
[23:54] Are you still upset about yesterday?
No...
[23:58] I'm not among those men who stay mad at their wives over small things. Forget about what happened.
[24:06] Why aren't you having breakfast then?
[24:08] Because I'm not hungry. I have an important class today and I don't want to miss it
[24:15] Alright fine. Be sure to eat when you feel hungry, don't starve yourself.
You're taking care of me like a western wife...
[24:23] When one starves, one eats. No one can stay hungry, even if they are upset. I've seen no person...
[24:31] who can stay hungry when they are upset. Besides, I'm not upset, so don't worry I'll eat.
[24:37] Okay... where are mom and dad?
They are up, they were asking about you.
[24:43] Tell them that I've left.
Go and spend time with them and eat breakfast, like a good daughter-in-law.
[24:51] I'll get going. Bye.
Farewell*
[25:08] Hadia, where are you going? Do you want something?
I was going to make Faizan's favorite paste.
[25:14] Ask Najma to make it.
No, I want to make it.
[25:20] A new bride is supposed to make something sweet first before partaking in house chores...
[25:26] But here, no one cares. You've started doing everything.
Don't worry, I'll make something sweet as well.
[25:34] Bless you, my dear.
I like it when you pray for me. I feel as though my mother is standing with me.
[25:42] Of course my dear, I am like your mother and you are just like Farwa to me...
[25:48] I pray for you and I used to pray for Natasha as well.
[25:56] But she ruined her life by hurting Safdar. May God create ease for her.
[26:03] Amen*
[26:07] I'll go and start preparing.
Alright.
[26:22] I don't know... the idea is good but...
[26:28] I fear one thing.
What's that?
[26:32] What if Hadia learns that the jewelry is fake?
[26:35] No, she will never know. I trust the jeweler I'm sending you to.
[26:42] We have used him before, right Ramsha?
[26:46] What mother means to say is that the jeweler is our old family jeweler.
[26:52] And, you can ask him to do anything. Hadia won't suspect a thing.
Alright.
[26:58] I'll take Hadia to him and buy her that set. I have to face my father's fear every day and it's getting terrible now.
[27:07] If you fear your father so much, then there was no need to give me your wife's stolen necklace to me.
[27:14] I did all of this for you.
Forget about what happened.
[27:20] Dragging this will only grow conflict. We have to fulfill our objective.
[27:25] I want that too... make her understand that. I'm not among those men who walk out in the middle.
[27:32] I'm always here with you two, but I need some time, to sort things out for myself.
[27:38] Sure, you're right. Ramsha doesn't think before she speaks.
[27:44] Will you have tea?
Sure...
[27:48] I'll be right back with it.
[28:15] Hey... you're back early today.
[28:17] Yes, I got free early. So I decided to come back home and spend time with you.
[28:22] Great, I've made your favorite white sauce paste. Change and I'll serve it for you.
[28:27] Thank you. I was thinking of going out to have lunch and we can go shopping as well.
[28:34] I don't need to shop, my wardrobe is full. But if you feel like going out, then let's go.
[28:42] I know that your wardrobe is full, but I was thinking of gifting you a gold necklace.
[28:47] That will be very expensive.
[28:51] I'm not that lightweight that I can't gift you a necklace. You endured a great loss and it's the least I can do.
[28:59] But...
No buts. I want no arguments. We'll do as I say...
[29:04] Besides, I didn't give you anything after our wedding, so let me do it, please.
[29:10] Just don't tell my parents. If you do it will be very bad for everyone.
[29:17] Don't worry, I won't tell them.
Get ready and we'll leave in a while. Can you keep this away?
[29:38] How much more will you eat?
There is taste in sister Hadia's hands.
[29:46] I've never eaten such tasty pasta.
It's all because of how her mother raised her.
[29:54] Her mother raised her well so that she wouldn't be embarrassed by her in-laws.
[30:01] Brother Faizan should have tasted it...
[30:08] Hmm... but... I'm happy that he's taken her out shopping.
[30:17] He's changing and his behavior has greatly improved as well.
[30:23] You don't know who brother Faizan is, he's very selfish. He'll go back to his old ways once he achieves his agenda.
[30:34] God forbid.
[30:37] God forbid it's like how we're thinking. Hadia has accepted him with open arms.
[30:45] I pray that Faizan accepts her too and that he doesn't betray her.
[30:52] Amen.
[30:58] Will you eat it? It's very tasty.
I've already eaten it. You've had enough as well.
[31:06] It's very tasty, you're missing out on it.
[31:10] I'll eat the entire thing. It's very tasty.
[31:24] You're my elder and you always make the right decision...
[31:31] But I have a request, please save Natasha from Shery.
[31:52] Hello... the legal notice that you were going to send my daughter...
[32:00] please stop it...
[32:04] What? You've already sent it out?
[32:10] Natasha would have gotten it by now.
[32:14] Lord knows how she will react.
[32:19] What if Razi's right?
[32:26] What if my daughter grows rebellious of me?
[33:25] Who was it?
[33:28] The courier. He brought a letter for you.
[33:32] A letter, from whom?
[33:36] From you rich father. It's a present for you.
[33:40] What?
[33:44] It's a legal notice. Your father has decided to disown you from his inheritance.
[33:55] What? But...
[34:00] Father can't do that...
