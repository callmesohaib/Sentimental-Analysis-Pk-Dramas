[01:08] I don't want it
[01:10] He did pay for ticket
[01:12] but have you thought of the future?
[01:16] You have spent all our savings
[01:19] Where will we live there? What will we eat? 
[01:24] Mother, how many times have I told you not to worry about these petty things
[01:28] There is no tension until Faizy is there
[01:31] He has arranged a place to stay for us
[01:33] what? Really?
[01:36] Where?
[01:37] Where we used to live. It was still empty. Faizan has paid 6 months rent. We will stay there.
[01:44] And he's coming to pick me from airport tomorrow. He will spend the whole day with me
[01:49] I don't want to stay in that rotten house. I don't feel like living there
[01:53] Ask Faizy to get us a house at a posh area.
[01:57] It can be rented
[02:00] Also hire some maids
[02:02] Mother, its a matter of few days only. Then we will get shifted with Faizy in his big house
[02:07] all your wishes will be fulfilled there
[02:10] enough
[02:12] I will see. He's a liar
[02:14] He keeps making false promises to you. He will never marry you. You can write it down
[02:20] I don't want to marry him in this situation
[02:23] he doesn't have anything of his own. Everything belongs to his father
[02:27] until he gets share from his property, I'm not interested in getting married to him
[02:32] Then stay like this your whole life
[02:35] That old man will never agree and won't give anything to Faizy from his wealth
[02:41] you will stay desperate for luxuries your whole life
[02:45] I'm your mother
[02:46] This is why I'm explaining it to you. Its for your betterment
[02:49] this is the time
[02:51] Pressurize him for wedding
[02:54] otherwise you'll spend your whole life in that old house as a girl friend
[02:59] marriage .. marriage .. marriage
[03:01] I'm tired of hearing this
[03:04] you also got married to my father
[03:07] what did you get?
[03:10] I'm living a good life style without even getting married
[03:14] what is it that I don't have?
[03:16] I'm beautiful and young
[03:19] I have many guys
[03:22] If not faizy, then someone else
[03:24] I won't ruin my life like you by getting married to a poor guy. Understood?
[03:28] Enough! Same taunts and rubbish. I have explained it to you a thousand times
[03:35] don't compare me with you. There is a huge difference between me and you
[03:41] I was helpless. I had no other option but to marry your poor father
[03:46] I had no one else
[03:48] but you have a rich guy like Faizy. Try to hold him
[03:53] mother, why don't you understand?
[03:55] I don't want to pressurize him by talking about wedding again and again. I don't want to upset him
[04:00] then fine, stop meeting and talking to him for some time
[04:05] then you'll see how will he come after you
[04:08] In this situation, going away from Faizy means that I'm giving Hadia a chance to get closer to him
[04:15] I won't make this mistake
[04:17] you aren't stuck to him the whole day
[04:20] she is with him for 24 hrs
[04:23] and don't trust a man
[04:26] there is no one more untrustworthy than a man
[04:29] you .. you talk to him about wedding
[04:32] if you can't then I will
[04:35] I will ask him what is it that my daughter doesn't have
[04:37] she isn't useless that anyone could have an affair and leave her
[04:42] he won't leave me ever
[04:45] I have complete faith in this
[04:49] its a blind trust
[04:51] when you know it very well that Hadia is more beautiful than you
[04:56] she might be. I don't care
[04:59] Only I rule Faizan's heart
[05:02] Hadia can never take my place. She can't
[05:07] Don't trust blindly
[05:09] its a big misconception
[05:11] Hadia is beautiful. She's around him 24 hrs. What do you think?
[05:16] there can't be place for her in Faizan's heart?
[05:19] You fool
[05:41] your dear son hasn't reached office
[05:45] when I told him that its an important meeting and he must come
[05:50] thanks to God that Raazi was present there
[05:53] otherwise I had to bear stress
[05:57] Faizan would have managed everything too
[06:00] but what's his fault if he got sick. He didn't go because he couldn't
[06:05] enough!
[06:07] you have crossed all the limits in supporting them
[06:11] We'd be in peace if you had shown strictness like me
[06:16] why do you blame me all the time
[06:19] you are at mistake too. You forcefully brought us back to Pakistan from America
[06:25] its obvious. Environment of both countries is too different
[06:27] Children couldn't adjust till now
[06:30] How many times would you tell me this? We have spent an ample of time here
[06:34] there should be change in them now. But now, they are still how they were
[06:38] nothing has changed
[06:42] come
[06:45] Sir, lawyer is here. He wants to meet you
[06:48] fine, you make him sit. I'm coming
[06:51] right sit
[06:55] why is a lawyer here?
[06:58] I have decided to take Natasha's name out of property
[07:42] yes?
[07:44] Hello Faizan? Where are you?
[07:46] Outside
[07:48] I know but with whom?
[07:51] with no one
[07:52] Faizan, don't lie
[07:54] I swear I'm not with anyone. There is no one
[07:58] For God's sake Faizan, I'm tired of your actions
[08:04] Didn't I ask you to go to office. Your father would be angry otherwise
[08:07] but you didn't listen to me
[08:12] Listen, I'm here to relax
[08:15] Please don't make me upset by talking about father. If there is anything important then tell me, otherwise I'm disconnecting
[08:20] Your father has called lawyer to take Natasha's name out of property
[08:24] How can he do this? What has happened to him? You have to stop him
[08:29] After what Natasha did, do you think your father would listen to me?
[08:33] Seriously, what has happened to him? Earlier he talked to disown me, and now Natasha?
[08:38] what has happened to him?
[08:40] you both have humiliated me in front of your father
[08:46] I couldn't explain or talk to Natasha 
[08:49] But please for God's sake, you do not take any such step
[08:52] that would make your father angry and he takes decision to disown you as well
[09:44] Natasha, this is a new phone
[09:47] I have put sim in it
[09:57] this is an old and cheap phone
[10:02] your husband is poor too
[10:05] I can afford this
[10:12] Listen, I'm going out for some time
[10:15] I have put some groceries in kitchen
[10:18] Before I come, do the cleaning and make dinner
[10:22] Neither I know how to clean nor I know how to cook
[10:27] look
[10:28] I have been ordering food for you since long. I'm out of budget. I can't afford
[10:33] you'd have to cook today
[10:36] I told you, I don't know how to cook
[11:20] Go and check. It would be your lover
[11:35] Finally, you thought about me and left your beautiful wife behind
[11:41] are you going to keep complaining here?
[11:43] won't you let me in?
[11:55] Faizan? Faizan? How are you? Come in
[11:59] its your house. Come anytime you want to
[12:03] who can stop you from coming here?
[12:06] by the way, your father has taken our house away
[12:10] she has spent all the savings
[12:13] now you are back
[12:15] don't you worry. You are my responsibility
[12:19] okay ..
[12:20] you sit and talk. I'll make something for you both
[12:33] Why are you upset?
[12:34] Why didn't you come to pick me to airport?
[12:38] you know it
[12:41] I swear, you are such a coward
[12:44] you breath with your father's permission
[12:49] are you done?
[12:53] lets go inside
[12:55] come
[13:16] hello? Who is this?
[13:21] Natasha?
[13:23] Natasha, where are you?
[13:25] how are you? why are you crying?
[13:28] mother?
[13:30] you didn't call me once and ask how am I and what condition am I in?
[13:34] what are you saying?
[13:36] do you know how much worried we are?
[13:39] your father hasn't slept since many days. I have been calling you again and again but your number was switched off
[13:44] where are you?
[13:47] I had an accident
[13:50] accident?
[13:51] how are you? where are you?
[13:54] I'm back home. I'm fine
[13:57] Give me your address. I'll come quickly
[14:01] Will you come to meet me not to take me?
[14:05] take you?
[14:07] what do you mean? do you want to come back?
[14:11] obviously mother
[14:13] I don't want to live in this hell anymore
[14:16] My child, you chose this hell for your own self
[14:21] what do you think? Your father will quickly accept you once you are back
[14:29] Give me some time and stay there for now. I'll come to meet you. We'll see what we can do
[15:18] We'd have to be more careful from now. Father's social circle is too big
[15:24] A lot of people know him professionally and personally
[15:27] We can't risk it. Whenever we have to meet
[15:30] we'll meet here, and I'll come
[15:33] for how long will we meet like this, Faizan?
[15:37] I'm helpless. This is how it will work for now. I have left office for you. I made an excuse of studying in university. And I will come to meet you during that time. 
[15:47] I have told everyone that all parties will be held at your home. So, we'll have fun
[15:54] You haven't done something good by leaving the office
[15:57] its foolishness. Without salary, you won't be able to bear your expenses. How will you afford her?
[16:04] I did send money on one call, before. I will send it again. You people are my responsibility
[16:09] but let us know from where will you bring this money
[16:16] this is my problem, but still if you want to know then I'll take money as university fee. When father would come to know that I'm continuing my studies, he'd be happy. I'm telling you, you don't have to worry
[16:33] I'm sorry, faizy
[16:35] I can't play this game anymore
[16:39] you'd have to tell your parents, otherwise ..
[16:43] you need to understand
[16:45] If father would know that you are back, you know what will happen. There will be a big problem
[16:55] He has taken decision to disown Natasha. Imagine, what will he do to me
[17:00] Faizy, are we going to spend our life meeting secretly like this?
[17:04] what has happened? Why don't you understand?
[17:08] She isn't listening to me. You explain it to her
[17:10] You explain it to me first, then talk to her
[17:17] Listen, you think my daughter is an ordinary person?
[17:22] what do you think? Shall I keep her single her whole life waiting for you?
[17:26] There are many proposals coming for her
[17:29] Many proposals came for her in Dubai. That Seth has reached my house for his son's proposal. but she refused saying this that she will only marry Faizy 
[17:43] and no one else
[17:47] I know but ..
[17:48] Enough! I have heard your stories of helplessness. I'm tired. Enough
[17:55] Now you'd have to decide who is more important in your life. Either Ramsha or Hadia?
[18:04] If you can't decide, then say good bye to her forever
[18:13] I can't leave her, you know this
[18:17] then you too try to understand me
[18:20] There is no one with Ramsha but me. She has no father. God forbid, if something happens to me tomorrow then who will look after her? Who?
[18:33] I want her to get married in my life. Look, you have to take decision today. If you want to marry her then its fine, otherwise I'll get her married somewhere else
[18:46] Look, wait a little more. Please!
[18:51] Its impossible for me to leave Hadia right now. And I can't do it
[18:55] And you both have to understand it
[19:02] have food. Have this
[19:05] Shall I give you water?
[19:07] No, its fine
[19:22] Its a good news that you are continuing your studies. I felt good hearing about it
[19:29] but my child, I won't suggest you to leave business
[19:34] I want you to continue it
[19:37] I won't say that education isn't important. Its very
[19:41] Take your business and studies together
[19:49] absolutely! I want the same
[19:54] Father, MBA won't be easy. The university I have got admission in, there is a tough competition
[20:00] I'd have to give time to studies. I don't want others to say that son of Safdar doesn't know how to run business
[20:09] University you are talking about, it is very difficult to get admission on merit there
[20:15] are you using some source?
[20:23] You think that my son can't get admission on merit?
[20:26] Let it go
[20:28] I promise I'll work hard as I can. I won't discontinue my studies this time
[20:38] well done
[20:40] I have decided to take financial management tutions after morning classes
[20:48] for the first time, after listening to such mature things from you
[20:52] I don't believe it that my son
[20:56] is this responsible
[20:58] wow
[20:59] and this all happened because of Hadia
[21:03] I have faith that she will change my son
[21:09] ofcourse
[21:12] Hadia has really changed me
[21:15] You were right about her. She's a blessing
[21:19] I'm happy that you chose Hadia for me. Thank you!
[21:24] Really?
[21:27] Ofcourse
[21:35] My child, I'm happy
[21:38] that you understood the value of this relationship finally
[21:42] I pray that you both stay happy like this
[21:46] What else would I want? Hadia, you tell me?
[21:51] do you have any complaints from Faizy?
[21:57] No!
[21:58] Are you upset? I mean does he take care of you?
[22:03] yes, very much
[22:07] fine my child, get admission tomorrow. Also, its been 3 months and you both haven't gone anywhere for outing
[22:13] I want you to go out somewhere for honeymoon
[22:19] Its a great plan. Fine, we'll do something
[22:24] I wish no evil eye catch these happiness
[22:27] May God keep you both happy always
[23:40] What was the need of lying to father?
[23:44] what kind of person are you?
[23:46] aren't you ashamed of playing with emotions of your elders?
[23:50] he was too satisfied hearing all this. When he'd come to know that it isn't me but Ramsha who lives in your heart
[23:56] then what will he go through?
[23:59] I didn't lie
[24:01] its the truth
[24:03] I'm happy with you
[24:08] I wasn't before. I do agree
[24:12] I have started liking you living with me
[24:15] your simplicity and beauty
[24:19] I like everything
[24:22] I generally feel that I'm lucky to have you with me
[24:27] enough, Faizan
[24:29] don't trap me like father. I know it very well who lives in your heart
[24:35] You are my wife, and she's my friend. Don't compare yourself with her
[24:42] you have a different position. No one can take your place in my heart
[24:48] then why don't you stop talking to her?
[24:50] I will .. very soon
[24:52] Why not now?
[24:53] I can't right now
[24:56] Hadia, I'm helpless
[25:03] I was committed to her before marrying you
[25:06] I promised her that I'll marry her but I ended up marrying you
[25:10] I came to know her reality after wedding. She and her mother blackmail me
[25:17] They have my few secrets
[25:19] If I'd stop talking to her, she'll tell those to father. And I don't want
[25:25] what secrets?
[25:28] Hadia, I can't tell those to you. Don't ask me anything else because I don't want to lie to you
[25:33] you are involved with such clever and blackmailer
[25:37] you talk to her the whole night on phone
[25:41] I don't believe it
[25:43] you are doing a new drama again
[25:44] I won't believe you
[25:59] Hadia, you are my wife
[26:02] you should support me
[26:05] the way I kept your secrets and didn't tell anyone
[26:09] I just need sometime. I promise you, I'll get rid of her
[26:14] And you know what, since we are married we didn't get time to spend with each other
[26:21] lets just go somewhere. Lets go away from this tension
[26:30] tell me?
[26:33] will you?
[26:34] come with me?
[27:17] you are satisfied with Faizan
[27:21] but think about Natasha now
[27:23] its been 10 days that she has left. Not once you asked about her
[27:27] don't take her name in front of me
[27:31] my blood pressure rises hearing her name
[27:35] for how long will this continue, Safdar?
[27:37] she is our daughter after all
[27:39] she was, not now
[27:42] she is dead for me
[27:44] what are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[27:46] I just got in senses. She didn't think about her father's dignity and his name
[27:57] she has ruined everything
[27:59] I don't want to hear a word about her. Go from here
[28:04] I won't talk about it further. Please, go
[28:08] Please!
[28:46] Faizan, wake up. Its first day of your university
[28:50] hmm! I'm waking up
[28:53] Take shower. I'll serve your breakfast
[29:06] you know what?
[29:08] you are very pretty
[29:13] sit
[29:16] sit
[29:22] Keep sitting with me today. I want to see you today
[29:31] why are you so shocked?
[29:34] you have never talked to me before
[29:37] I know, it was my mistake
[29:40] I ignored you, but I won't now
[29:44] I promise I will give you my most time
[29:47] I will
[29:49] I did make a mistake.
[29:54] I don't believe it
[29:56] about what?
[29:59] that ..
[30:01] how can someone change so suddenly?
[30:06] ask this to yourself
[30:09] your behavior and your simplicity
[30:13] your love has changed me
[30:15] I have changed because of you
[30:19] Hadia, you have won
[30:21] I have lost
[30:28] finally, I agreed why father chose you
[30:31] enough of the talks. Its too late now. Get ready, I'll serve you breakfast
[30:38] hey, servant will do everything
[30:43] I want to see you
[30:47] Now when I have started liking you, I don't want you to go away
[30:51] never
[31:10] If you had to go out with Faizan, then why did you wake me up?
[31:16] you know that I don't wake up early
[31:18] I feel sick
[31:20] now get used to of it
[31:22] Faizan will come to meet me daily
[31:27] Faizan's father is a clever person
[31:30] I don't think so this drama would continue in front of him
[31:34] Faizan isn't less, mother
[31:37] he did right thing by making an excuse of studying in university
[31:41] now we can meet easily, and no one would doubt us
[31:50] listen?
[31:52] I need some money
[31:54] money?
[31:56] I don't have money. All I had is finished
[32:00] Faizan sent so much money. How can you spend so soon?
[32:04] He sent few hundred thousands not millions. I spent them on home
[32:12] now you are going with Faizan
[32:14] Ask him money. You are his responsibility now
[32:18] Keep him under your control
[32:20] Fine, I'll talk but you too spend less
[32:24] Hey, I don't spend on myself. I spend on house
[32:30] now she'd tell me to spend less
[32:49] my child, you'd have to focus on your studies now
[32:53] outings
[32:56] and you have to avoid your friend's company
[33:01] father, I'll make sure I don't give you a chance to complain
[33:07] and I will give credit of this change to Hadia
[33:17] what do you mean? Am I not responsible?
[33:26] he would have changed long ago if you were responsible
[33:32] but I feel that a good and mature wife
[33:38] can bring her husband to the right track, no matter how spoiled he is.
[33:49] no, the credit goes to Faizan
[33:53] I am myself shocked how is he too changed?
[33:57] he has finally realized to study
[34:05] there is nothing wrong if one takes time in realizing his mistake
[34:08] Faizan, this is your semester fee. Deposit it
[34:13] and you have to take management classes in the evening. Have this my child
[34:18] Definitely
[34:20] and make sure
[34:23] you should have every facility to get these management classes
[34:27] I want, in future
[34:29] you have to look after many responsibilities and my whole business
[34:37] don't you worry about office. I and Raazi would handle everything
[34:42] its obvious
[34:44] a son is father's right hand
[34:54] shall I go?
[34:57] okay my child
[34:59] Okay!
[35:00] bye!
[35:03] you ladies go and have a look what's going on in kitchen. I'm too hungry
[35:07] yes
[35:15] Greetings! Raazi
[35:20] don't go to office
[35:22] I need something important
[35:32] you go to university
[35:36] and keep an eye on Faizan
[35:39] change in Faizan
[35:45] isn't understandable
[35:54] change is definitely good
[35:57] but I'm his father
[36:01] I am well familiar with his nature and habits
[36:06] I want you to see
[36:08] where is he going and what is his company
[36:12] isn't he meeting his rowdy friends again?
[36:17] I didn't refuse him because it could break his heart
[36:21] are you understanding what I'm telling you?
[36:39] I will wait for your call
[37:23] What is it, Ramsha? Why are you calling again and again?
[37:26] to ask where are you?
[37:29] you asked about 10 a.m. and its 10:30. I got ready early only for you
[37:34] I can't come right now. I'm going to university
[37:36] for what?
[37:39] have you taken admission in real?
[37:42] Father is doubtful about me. He has asked Raazi to spy on me
[37:46] He just wants to find out if I'm really in university
[37:50] I knew it
[37:51] I knew that it isn't easy to make your father fool
[37:57] what will happen now, Faizan? How will we meet?
[38:00] I will do something but let me deal with this first. I have to reach before him. I don't have time
[38:07] Ramsha, you just don't understand. I'm telling you my problem and you aren't getting it
[38:13] I just told you that I have to reach university. I have to be there before Raazi.
[38:18] and what are you talking about
[38:20] and how many times have I told you not to call me when Hadia is with me at night
[38:25] I have to pretend in front of her. I convinced her talking about love
[38:30] you don't know what's going to happen if she'd come to know
[38:33] Since when are you scared of her?
[38:35] I'm not but it is important to keep Hadia happy for father
