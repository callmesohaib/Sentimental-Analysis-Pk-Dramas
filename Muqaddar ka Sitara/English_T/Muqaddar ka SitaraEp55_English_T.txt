[01:22] Everyone at home must be worried about my and Faizan's absence. I need to be at home immediately.
[01:28] Yes, I'm trying. No one is picking up.
[01:36] The city is at least sixty to seventy kilometers away from here.
[01:42] In these conditions, you guys shouldn't have traveled here. I don't know why he brought you here.
[02:15] Are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine, what happened to the car?
[02:21] Let me check.
[03:12] The car's engine has heated up, that's why it has shut off. Let me check.
[03:25] Don't worry, I'll check. Please keep sitting.
[03:31] Give me whatever you have. Hurry up!
[03:35] Hurry up and give me everything!
[03:47] Give me your purse. Don't say anything and back off!
[03:56] Hurry up!
[04:11] Are you alright?
[04:37] Give me two minutes.
[05:12] Do something Razi... we're already late. We weren't able to reach anyone at home, and on top of that, our phones have been snatched as well.
[05:19] Borrow someone's phone and talk to Faizan, or at least reach out to someone at home.
[05:26] Hadia, our cell phones have been snatched.
[05:31] And I don't remember anyone's number, what should I do?
[05:38] Please calm down. Don't worry, everything will be alright.
[05:43] I've added water to the radiator. Soon the engine will cool down...
[05:50] and we'll leave. Besides, in this condition, you shouldn't take any stress.
[05:56] Please take me home by any means necessary. Lord knows what everyone at home must be thinking about me.
[06:04] I told you, don't worry.
[06:10] God willing everything will be alright
[06:29] Natasha, call Razi again and ask him where he is.
[06:34] Auntie, I've been trying for ages, I texted as well, but he's not answering.
[06:40] I'm worried as well. There is no news from anywhere.
[06:46] Shina, I told you not to send Hadia out in her state.
[06:51] In her state carelessness is not good. Faizan should have thought about that.
[06:58] May God have mercy.
[07:01] May God keep those children under His protection.
Natasha, call Faizan's friends.
[07:09] Mother, they are at a party, and it's normal for them to be late. I'm worried about Razi.
[07:18] He's not picking up or replying to any messages.
Father is here.
[07:24] Safdar...
Where was your father? We've been waiting for you for ages.
[07:29] What happened, is everything alright? Why are you guys sitting here at this hour?
[07:33] Safdar, I don't where Razi has gone. He's not picking up any calls or replying to any messages.
[07:40] And... Faizan isn't here as well. Both of them said that they'll be back by midnight and it has exceeded that.
[07:50] He hasn't come home yet and his phone is switched off as well.
[08:32] What happened? Is the car okay now?
[08:35] The engine is cooled down, and God willing the car will start soon.
[08:41] In the name of God...
[09:01] Faizan where were you? Have you looked at the time?
[09:08] Where's Hadia?
[09:12] What do you mean? She should be with you.
[09:16] She did go with me, but she didn't come back with me.
[09:23] What do you mean?
[09:25] We went to a party. I got unwell and fell unconscious when I woke up she wasn't there.
[09:38] Do you know where she is? She's with Razi right now.
[09:48] Faizan, what are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[09:53] Father, I'm telling the truth. When I woke up, my friends told me that she left with Razi.
[10:02] Auntie, after what your son has done he doesn't deserve to live in this house.
Enough Faizan!
[10:08] Not one more word. I will not hear anything!
[10:12] You will have to listen.
[10:19] I will not remain silent anymore because this matter now concerns the honor of this house and my wife!
[10:25] Do you know where he is with Hadia right now? Your son has back-stabbed us all!
[10:31] Faizan just shut up!
[10:33] Hadia went with you to the party.
Don't you understand what I'm saying? Don't you get it?
[10:41] She did go with me, but she didn't come back with me. She took advantage of my unconscious state. She called Razi and went with him.
[10:51] Enough... how much more lies will you tell? How many allegations will you put on them both?
[10:57] Tell us that all of this is a lie and you're alleging the two of them.
[11:09] Just wait... father check your phone.
[11:31] Safdar, all of this is a lie, Faizan is lying.
[11:37] My son cannot do this. My education is not lacking. This is not the way that I raised him.
[11:46] That's what's disappointing. Nothing was lacking in your education or my blessings.
[11:53] Then why did he do something so vile?
[11:55] Safdar?
[11:58] He has dishonored his own home. An honorable man can't even think of doing what he did.
[12:08] I raised Razi as my son, I trusted him as a member of my home, and in return...
[12:14] he did this. He has hurt my trust and love!
[12:23] I will never forgive him. More than that I never thought anything of my son in front of him.
[12:30] In return he... I feel ashamed. He used a meeting as an excuse to leave and God knows...
[12:43] Father... Hadia would never do this. Razia would never do something like this. You know them both.
[12:52] Razi would never cheat on me, nor would he betray me.
[13:04] I knew no one would believe me. That's why I brought proof. This phone has pictures of Hadia and Razi leaving together from the farmhouse.
[13:51] All of this is a lie. I don't believe these pictures. You are trying to defame Razi.
[13:58] You've gone insane! Why would I do all this?
[14:03] Because you hate Razi, that's why you did all this to him.
I'm not insane Natasha!
[14:15] Why would I expose my wife in front of everyone else?
[14:20] I told you so many times not to do this. You didn't trust me, can't you see it with your own eyes?
[14:40] Mother, why aren't you asking Faizan to quiet himself?
[14:45] Razi can never do something like this. Mother, say something.
[14:54] What should I say? I don't understand myself. I'm in shock as well.
[15:00] I could never imagine them doing something like this. I even feel ashamed saying it.
[15:24] Razi can never do something like this.
Natasha...
[17:05] Razi, you can't do this to me.
[17:09] I trusted you the most.
[17:14] I trusted you so much. I even handed my entire business over to you.
[17:28] I preferred you over my son. I even trusted you with my daughter, but you...
[17:38] This is how you repaid me? Look how you broke my trust.
[17:48] That's why you weren't even picking up my calls. And Hadia...
[17:55] how can you do all of this to me? How can you shatter my family's respect?
[18:08] If what I saw turns out to be the truth...
[18:12] then I will lose all faith in this entire world. I will never forgive you two.
[18:19] Never.
[19:30] God... please help me get out of this tough situation.
[19:35] My entire life's great deeds are on the line.
[19:40] You will help me in the hereafter. But help me in this world as well, as it is the place I'm currently in.
[19:49] God, I'm weak and helpless. I don't have the strength to endure such sadness at this age.
[20:00] Help me God... help me.
[21:56] You two are back! Why are you two here after spending the entire night together and destroying our family's honor?
[22:14] What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[22:21] I've come to my senses! Your ill deeds have been exposed to all of us!
[22:33] Do you even know what you're saying?
I know what I'm saying. We thought our son was a liar.
[22:42] And believed you two, and this is how you repaid me? And Hadia you...
[22:48] you thought yourself to be a saint. We thought that too, but look how you turned out to be
[22:56] Your parents used you to sing your praises to anyone who would hear it.
[23:01] But look at you and your sister. Your sister betrayed his fiance and had an affair with her class fellow...
[23:08] and you couldn't find anyone other than your husband's cousin to have an affair with.
[23:14] Quiet! I cannot hear more of this!
[23:32] Have some fear of God.
You two should be afraid of God.
[23:36] You two deceived everyone. This is how repaid your uncle. You fed off our scraps all your life.
[23:46] What didn't he do for you? Instead of being grateful to us...
[23:51] you did all of this. Hadia not once did you care about your old parent's reputation.
[24:02] If you say a word against my parents, then none will be worse than me!
[24:11] There is none worse than you. I feel ashamed calling a characterless girl like you my daughter-in-law.
[24:25] What are you saying? Why are putting these vile allegations on me? You took me there and then disappeared. I asked everyone...
[24:38] What? Was I the one who disappeared?
[24:42] Did I disappear, or did you leave with him?
[24:47] What nonsense is this?
[24:52] Take a look at their phones. They must have messages, that will prove that they have been meeting each other in hiding.
[25:06] We don't have our phones, they have been snatched!
I have evidence, how will you falsify them?
[25:14] This is not something that just happened. This has been going on since my marriage. I had evidence in my phone, but my phone was snatched.
[25:20] I tried telling everyone, but no one believed me.
Uncle, he's lying.
[25:28] I was at work when I received Hadia's message. I left immediately when I went there...
[25:36] he had already left Hadia there.
[25:42] It's another one of his ploys. He wants to degrade me in front of you.
[25:57] Do you think all of this is a ploy?
[26:01] Then look at this? How will you falsify these pictures?
[26:11] There is no truth in them.
[26:18] The truth between you two has been exposed. Before I humiliate you further, accept it!
[26:28] Hadia...
[26:32] I care about you, I want to forgive you. I don't care about him. You're my wife, their daughter-in-law, and the honor of this house.
[26:45] You're about to become the mother to my child. So please, apologize to everyone.
[26:51] Hadia, apologize to everyone. I want to forgive you, so please ask for forgiveness.
[27:03] When I didn't do anything, then what should I apologize for?
[27:13] I feel ashamed of you Faizan!
[27:21] I feel ashamed even thinking that a liar like you is my husband.
[27:33] I'm innocent father. I haven't done anything.
[27:39] I can swear on the Quran that I haven't done anything like this. Father, you know I'm not like this.
[27:46] All of this is an allegation. That place didn't have any signals and on the way, our car broke down.
[27:56] Then our phones were snatched... all of this is a lie!
Enough Hadia! How much more will you lie!?
[28:07] How can so much happen in one night? Even if that is the truth, then how did he reach there? Who told him the address?
[28:17] I didn't call him. Father, believe me, I didn't call him.
[28:34] Uncle...
[28:37] this is all Faizan's doing.
[28:41] He thinks he'll succeed in his plan, but I won't let him.
[28:48] Uncle...
[28:51] He has fallen so low in his hatred for me that he's alleging his wife.
[29:04] You hate me, right? Then take it out on me. I'll leave this house, but why are you putting allegations on Hadia?
[29:26] It seems that the thief is scolding the police officer.
[29:30] Why don't you say anything? Why are you silent?
[29:34] This is an allegation!
[29:39] All of this is nonsense!
Enough!
[29:43] Enough...
[30:00] I could never think that you could stoop so low.
[30:07] I, Safdar Kamal...
[30:11] end my relationship with you people.
[30:21] Before I lose control...
[30:24] get out. Get out!
[31:25] Let's go, mother.
[32:04] Natasha!
[32:27] Natasha... Safdar...
I'll bring water for her.
[32:32] Go away from here! Go!
[32:38] Natasha! Safdar look at her...
[32:42] Natasha... Natasha... 
[32:47] My dear... Natasha... hurry up with that water.
[32:53] Natasha...
Wow!
[32:56] This happened how I wanted it to happen. I've achieved what I wanted to!
[33:04] Sure... all the credit is yours... it's like I didn't do anything.
[33:09] No... Zohaib, it's not like that. I know how much of a well-wisher you are for me.
[33:16] And if you hadn't helped me, then maybe I wouldn't have achieved all of this alone.
[33:22] Obviously.
But you have to admit that I'm lucky.
[33:27] And, fate has been kind to me. Everything happened as I planned it
[33:36] Do one thing... call Faizan right now and ask about the situation over there.
[33:42] Up till now, they must have ousted Hadia, right?
[33:47] I don't know about Hadia, but Razi must have been ousted by now.
[33:54] Razi is not my problem, Hadia is.
[33:58] If you remember, I made a deal with you. I told you that I would have Hadia ousted from there.
[34:05] And now I want to enter Safdar Kamal's home soon.
[34:10] I can't tolerate Hadia in that home anymore.
[34:17] Yeah...
[34:23] Will you have tea?
No thanks.
[34:54] Razi... for God's sake, tell me the truth.
[35:01] My heart is shattered. What is the truth?
[35:06] You too mother?
[35:09] You too want the truth?
[35:15] Don't you trust me?
I trust you... I trust my son!
[35:21] I believe you and I know that my son can never do something so low.
[35:27] But, those pictures, those messages, what is all that?
Mother...
[35:35] Please...
[35:47] All of this is a lie. Faizan did all of that!
[35:52] I didn't do anything like that. I'm your son, Razi.
[35:57] I can never do anything wrong to anyone.
[36:03] You'll only have to trust me, please.
[36:06] Mother...
[36:13] Because mother I...
[36:16] I don't have anything but the truth to prove my innocence.
[36:25] You want to know, right? Then hear the truth...
[36:32] That night, I was at work... I got a message from Hadia's phone... the message read that there was trouble.
[36:41] I went straight to her since the farmhouse was very far away. The car broke down on our way back.
[36:47] Then some snatchers took away our phones. I couldn't contact you guys or a mechanic. We were isolated there for the entire night!
[36:54] I don't want to know who took the pictures, because I only intended to save Hadia.
[37:04] Faizan has put vile allegations against me.
[37:34] Her mental state is not stable. I've given her anti-depressant medications...
[37:40] If that doesn't make any difference, then we'll have to give her injections.
[37:44] But, that is not a solution. I asked you to treat her properly last time.
[37:51] She needs complete treatment. If she isn't treated, her condition will get worse.
[37:58] I'm writing some medicine... please make sure to give it to her on time.
[38:07] Take a look at these medications.
