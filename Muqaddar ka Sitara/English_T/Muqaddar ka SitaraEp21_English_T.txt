[04:09] Hadia, I think everyone had a misconception
[04:16] and this must be clarified
[04:19] but I don't think so
[04:22] Also, misconceptions are clarified when you have a relationship
[04:27] and we don't have a relationship
[04:48] you are a very good person
[04:52] there is no doubt in it
[04:58] but
[05:01] but now I ..
[05:03] don't need either your sympathy or help
[05:11] from heart
[05:14] take all the feelings out for me
[05:20] I ..
[05:22] have also taken it out
[05:58] Did you see? How is he suffering?
[06:03] mother
[06:08] brother will be fine soon
[06:11] don't you worry
[06:12] since the time he's back from Hyderabad, he seems lost.
[06:17] Neither he's eating nor drinking.
[06:19] He's just repeating the same thing, that Hadia made a mistake in recognizing
[06:25] She kept talking to him thinking he's Faizan
[06:29] you are right
[06:33] Sister Hadia isn't what we thought about her
[06:38] there was a misconception
[06:41] I have no interest in that. I curse the time when she entered my son's life
[06:48] and has made him crazy
[07:35] have milk
[07:38] what is it, mother?
[07:39] you are still awake
[07:44] you are awake too
[07:50] don't worry about me, mother. I'm used to of staying awake at night
[08:02] if you'll stay awake at night
[08:04] and stay upset
[08:08] then what will your mother go through?
[08:12] do you realize it?
[08:18] yes I ..
[08:21] I thought
[08:23] to go out of this country
[08:29] what?
[08:31] what are you saying?
[08:34] don't you worry. I'll call you as soon as I'll settle down
[08:39] also ..
[08:40] uncle's business is already established
[08:45] so I don't think so uncle needs me here anymore
[08:51] will you leave your mother and sister here alone and leave?
[08:56] no mother, I'll call you as soon as I'd settle down there
[09:01] you took this big decision alone?
[09:05] you did ask me or tell me?
[09:13] mother?
[09:16] I .. I am in extreme pain
[09:22] I think ..
[09:25] that this pain will only go away until I leave this place
[09:33] I want to reduce this pain
[09:36] to reduce this pain, I'll go away
[09:42] So ..
[09:45] you love Hadia a lot
[10:07] I do
[10:10] I do love her
[10:15] I love her a lot
[10:19] I love her extremely
[10:28] I try hard, mother
[10:31] to take myself out of this feeling
[10:36] but I always fail
[10:47] Mother, I feel
[10:51] that I'd have to go away from this all
[10:54] I have a request from you, please
[11:00] accept this
[11:06] this is better for us all
[11:11] Raazi?
[12:09] I used to say it before that brother Razi is a wonderful person
[12:12] you were having doubts for no reason
[12:15] Do you know, only father keeps talking about Raazi there days
[12:18] since the time he met him, he is always talking about brother Raazi
[12:22] Raazi is like this, or that ..
[12:26] Fizza, enough
[12:29] Do you want to talk about another topic?
[12:31] or shall I disconnect?
[12:32] Hey, why are you getting upset? I was just telling you
[12:38] Tell me this, how is your husband?
[12:41] He came to meet only for 5 minutes and then he disappeared. Is he fine with you?
[12:49] yes! Everything is fine
[12:51] By the way, he seems very boring
[12:54] I don't know how do you live with him
[12:57] You tell me, how is Nissar?
[13:00] Did he call after reaching U.S.?
[13:02] yes!
[13:03] He has called 50 times
[13:06] Sister, you are laughing?
[13:10] Fizza, because you are so adorable
[13:13] any person like Nissar can fall for you
[13:18] you are too lucky, by the way
[13:21] you have found a guy who loves you a lot and value you a lot
[13:27] I wish brother Faizan was the same
[13:30] and used to value you the same way
[13:32] Sometimes I think that I wish you had got married to brother Razi
[13:36] He's so nice. He takes such good care and love you a lot
[13:41] enough Fizza
[13:42] Don't annoy me by mentioning him again and again
[13:45] I'm so sorry
[13:46] but what do I do? I can't stop myself from mentioning him
[13:50] he's so good
[13:53] I wish there was no misconception between you both
[13:57] and you were married to him today and were living a peaceful life
[14:07] Sister?
[14:32] Think about it
[14:34] it won't be so easy to live life with me
[14:38] you are forgetting that you proposed me, not me
[14:46] I still have many options too
[14:48] I gave you priority because you are my friend
[14:55] and what is important for marriage
[14:58] to understand each other?
[15:03] and as far as love is concerned, it can happen later too
[15:09] really?
[15:11] yes, if you'll understand me give me liberty and luxuries
[15:17] that are important to spend a normal life
[15:21] Natasha
[15:22] you know how lonely I am
[15:25] and it would be difficult to convince your parents
[15:30] it is my job to convince my parents
[15:33] you just prepare to meet father
[15:37] and how do I prepare myself for that?
[15:40] umm .. father isn't an easy person to satisfy so prepare accordingly
[15:48] are you scaring me?
[15:50] no, I'm not. I'm just telling you that he's not an easy person. So get ready
[15:59] Sure!
[16:38] Come in, Natasha
[16:41] whats up?
[16:42] sit!
[16:46] who is this Sherry and how do you know him?
[16:51] Don't you remember? I introduced you to him on Kinza's birthday party
[16:56] Is he the same guy whose parents died in an accident?
[17:04] you ..
[17:05] you want to marry a guy who doesn't have parents and family?
[17:11] he lives in a weird apartment
[17:13] you want to get married to a middle class guy?
[17:17] no mother, its quiet the opposite. Kinza told us wrong
[17:21] he is very rich. He has ownership of many properties
[17:25] Actually, you know what? Kinza is jealous of me
[17:29] she doesn't want me to get a handsome and rich guy
[17:32] whatever. But ..
[17:34] neither I'm in favor of you getting married to such guy.
[17:38] And you know your father very well that how much importance does he give to relations and family
[17:44] Look, I won't let you do anything when it comes to wedding
[17:49] mother please, I want to live my life according to me.
[17:53] And I won't let you and father control it
[17:57] Don't be a fool, Natasha. He doesn't love you. He loves your wealth and your father's status
[18:05] So, what's wrong in it?
[18:08] Raazi also listens to father only for his money.
[18:12] And sister Hadia is ignoring all bad habits of brother only because of his money.
[18:22] mother, these days everyone is running after money.
[18:26] No one wants to see each other if he hasn't have a good status
[18:31] What do you think? Will your father let you marry such guy? Your father won't ever agree
[18:40] the one who has no name and no dignity
[18:44] Father also didn't have any status before going to U.S.
[18:48] He built everything after going to U.S. What was he before that? What was his family?
[18:56] Mother, you know that I always wanted a guy who is alone
[19:02] and finally I have got that thing. Be happy for me
[19:39] who is that guy?
[19:42] that she is talking about?
[19:50] Father, its my friend Sherry. Mother has met him
[20:08] I have clearly said it to you
[20:11] Madam, sir is calling you
[20:14] At this time?
[20:16] yes, he was asking me to call madam quickly
[20:19] you go, I'm coming
[20:25] I'll come with you too
[20:27] No, I'll go and listen to him. You stay here
[20:46] I can't even imagine that how could she think about getting married to a rowdy guy like Sherry?
[20:52] and what kind of mother you are? You are unaware of your daughter's activities?
[21:04] Come in!
[21:06] What is it, Safdar?
[21:07] I wanted to talk something important, infact I wanted to request
[21:13] why are you embarrassing me? What is it?
[21:18] umm
[21:26] Sister, make Natasha your daughter in law
[22:06] Sister?
[22:08] Make Natasha your daughter in law
[22:17] For God's sake, don't refuse. This week
[22:24] I want Raazi and Natasha to get married
[22:28] My dignity is in your hands
[22:34] that's fine, but exactly happened?
[22:38] what did Natasha do that ..
[22:42] Sister, one has many doubts about their children
[22:47] and when a father is wealthy like Safdar
[22:54] then many people get chance to manipulate innocent girls like Natasha
[23:00] this is it
[23:06] fine!
[23:08] I'll talk to Raazi
[23:11] but ..
[23:12] I can't make a promise
[23:15] because to take decision of his life ..
[23:19] If I try to find my whole life, still
[23:22] I can't find a pious and selfless son in law like Raazi
[23:26] I will even fold my hands in front of him, if I'd have to for my daughter's future
[23:32] no, Safdar
[23:34] don't do this
[23:37] I'll convince him. I'll try hard. He will be ready
[23:48] How can I forget your favors
[23:52] you took care of me and my children your whole life
[23:56] you had never let my children miss their father
[24:02] my brother, how can I refuse?
[24:05] who .. who is ours other than you?
[24:10] Sister, till tomorrow morning
[24:13] I want to hear yes as an answer. I want to fulfill my responsibility as soon as possible.
[24:22] Fine!
[24:24] I'll talk to him
[24:28] I also have a demand
[24:31] Order it
[24:35] I convinced Raazi to stay at this house after so much effort
[24:39] After wedding, he won't stay here in this house as a son in law
[24:44] Sister, there is no problem
[24:47] I'll shift you to my clifton house
[24:51] no, he won't agree
[24:54] we'll do this
[24:58] we'll rent a nearby house
[25:02] and after wedding
[25:05] Natasha would have to stay with us in that house
[25:09] as you wish. Thanks a lot
[25:13] Don't you worry
[25:15] Everything will be fine. I will try my best
[25:45] mother, what has happened to you all? This can't be possible
[25:51] Look Natasha
[25:53] no power in the world can change your father's decision
[25:59] Listen to me, I want the same.
[26:01] I want you to get married and stay in this house in front of me
[26:05] mother, what has happened to you?
[26:07] The guy I have already rejected, father wants me to marry him?
[26:12] I won't marry that guy even if he's the last guy in the world.
[26:17] And what happened to you? Since when have you started listening to father?
[26:21] Look, Natasha
[26:23] Try to understand. I'm trying to stop you from making another mistake. Its better for you
[26:31] Mother, stop it. Tell father that I won't marry Sherry and Raazi both
[26:40] The guy who is fed by my father, I would get married to him to make him son in law of this guy? No way mother. I had it
[27:00] What? What did uncle say?
[27:11] its the time, my child
[27:16] We should pay Safdar back
[27:21] what do you mean?
[27:30] you
[27:32] would have to get married to Natasha
[27:42] This isn't only Safdar's but mine decision too
[27:47] what?
[28:32] Look, I am not interested in Natasha's choice
[28:38] Safdar, you can't force about wedding
[28:43] I kept quiet when it came to Faizan and supported you. But I won't do it about Natasha
[28:52] You'd have to listen because I'm their father.
[28:56] As far as Natasha is concerned, she doesn't know right and wrong
[29:01] and she doesn't deserve guys like David and Sherry
[29:07] and as far as Ramsha is concerned
[29:09] forget her. All these people
[29:13] are after our children status, not our children
[29:16] their wealth. And I won't let it happen
[29:18] I won't let them ruin my children life and my wealth
[29:24] She won't marry Sherry. She made a promise
[29:28] But, she won't marry Raazi too
[29:34] tell me one thing. What flaw is it that you see in Raazi?
[29:39] He isn't of our status and standard.
[29:42] There is a huge difference in Natasha's and Raazi's personality
[29:46] and secondly, Natasha would never like to stay in this house after wedding
[29:59] I'm shocked
[30:19] Bring breakfast here. I'm not going outside.
[30:21] Why?
[30:23] Do what I asked you. Don't ask questions
[30:34] There is a lot of tension in home because of Natasha. I don't want to be a part of it. It ruins my mood
[30:40] she's your sister
[30:42] you should support her
[30:44] why so?
[30:47] She's a fool. She was with a wrong guy
[30:53] It doesn't happen but I'm with father in this matter
[30:58] she is stubborn and emotional but she can be explained with love
[31:07] if you say, shall I talk to her?
[31:12] go ahead if you want to be insulted
[31:16] there is no use
[31:19] father won't agree
[31:21] he would never
[31:25] but I'm not in favor of Raazi too
[31:31] He and his family stays here. That bothers me. If he'd get married to Natasha
[31:36] they'd settle here down permanently
[31:40] what is the problem in it?
[31:43] there are good people
[31:45] auntie and Farwa handle all house chores with me
[31:48] they keep an eye on maids and help in kitchen. And Raazi
[31:59] Raazi is a decent and hard working guy
[32:03] uncle considers him his right hand
[32:09] I told you that I don't like them and here you are praising them?
[32:16] Don't praise Raazi in front of me
[32:19] never
[32:24] Why are you standing here? Go! Bring me breakfast
[32:33] won't you go to office today?
[32:36] You didn't go yesterday and went only for 2 hours day before that
[32:39] what is your problem?
[32:41] What is your problem if I go to office or not?
[32:43] I'm saying because uncle is upset because of you.
[32:47] Enough is enough Faiza. Now help him in business like a responsible child
[32:54] Be my wife, don't be my teacher
[32:59] I'm explaining it to you because ..
[33:03] What?
[33:06] don't you like me to stay here and see my face?
[33:15] I know how happy you are in my absence
[33:18] you talk to your sister for hours
[33:22] there is nothing like that
[33:25] I'm just saying because uncle is worried about you
[33:29] he loves you a lot
[33:32] why do you keep him upset?
[33:36] Enough! I know what to do. You won't tell me
[33:42] you are my wife
[33:45] your job is to keep me happy
[33:50] now go and bring breakfast
[34:25] what does he think?
[34:28] wedding is the most important decision of one's life
[34:33] what is the use of this life if you can't take this decision yourself
[34:37] enough Raazi, for God's sake. Leave it. I have given him my word
[34:47] Fine then
[34:49] I will leave this country and go.
[34:52] That's the only solution of this problem
[34:56] fine, get separated after getting married to Natasha
[35:02] but take the thought of going to another country out of your mind
[35:07] you are my only son. I can't let you go out
[35:11] I won't go alone, mother. I will take you both with me
[35:18] Are you doing it because of Hadia?
[35:23] You don't want to face her staying here
[35:27] you can't take her out of your heart?
[35:30] is this why you want to go away?
[35:33] For how long will you keep punishing your mother for your failed love?
[35:41] You are right. This is what it is
[35:44] I can't tolerate her with with Faizan
[35:48] Don't you dare, Raazi
[35:51] no more words now
[35:55] Don't take Hadia's name next time. She is your sister in law
[35:59] I tried
[36:01] but I couldn't take her out of my heart
[36:07] I know it
[36:09] I know that she can never be mine but what do I do? 
[36:13] I don't have control on this heart
[36:19] this heart isn't ready to accept. If it was then I would have listened to you and uncle
