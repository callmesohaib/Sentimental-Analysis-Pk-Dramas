[01:27] are you going there? but my child ..
[01:29] I have taken permission from uncle
[01:31] I will take Natasha out of Sherry's trap
[01:34] that's fine my child but I'm worried about you
[01:37] he's a dangerous guy. What if he'd hurt you?
[01:41] Don't you worry, mother. Your prayers are with me
[01:45] mother please, pray for me
[01:47] I want to keep uncle's dignity
[01:49] my child, take care of yourself. God will give you success

[02:01] May God have mercy
[02:30] Man, do one more robbery at my house
[02:38] her cousin gave her a very expensive phone
[02:42] he might have given her some cash
[02:45] and if ..
[02:46] not now, he's give it later
[02:48] okay
[02:50] let that cousin come two more times
[02:53] once you have gathered some amount, I'll send my men
[02:57] I think, her cousin has a doubt on me
[03:00] he knows everything
[03:03] fool him
[03:04] He was revealing my truth in front of Natasha
[03:07] I handled her on time
[03:14] Does he know that you did that robbery?
[03:20] no!
[03:21] I don't think so he knows anything
[03:27] then why did he give her the phone?
[03:31] One should think
[03:36] but if he had told anything to Natasha, she wouldn't have spared me
[03:40] she was asking me ..
[03:42] why did my cousin call you fraud?
[03:46] now you go. She'd be coming now
[03:50] but you were saying she has gone for long
[03:54] yes, but one has to be careful
[03:57] also, if her cousin appears then we'd be in trouble
[04:01] Now go! pick up this stuff too
[04:15] Natasha, when did you come? I couldn't know
[04:20] the way I couldn't know your purpose of coming into my life
[04:25] Natasha, lets sit and talk
[04:27] Raazi was right about you. You are a big cheater
[04:33] Look, we'll sit and talk ..
[04:34] Don't touch me! I have heard all your rubbish
[04:39] Did you get married to me because .. because of my wealth?
[04:45] Did you do the robbery?
[04:49] Natasha?
[04:52] you might have forgotten that I'm a daughter of Safdar Kamal
[04:56] Enough!
[05:06] Be quiet! Get lost
[05:12] what did you think that you'll get rid of me easily?
[05:15] Sherry?
[05:17] what do you think of yourself?
[05:19] huh? what?
[05:21] Speak up! Look at me?
[05:30] You will get rid of me so easily?
[05:35] Natasha, are you fine?
[05:36] Raazi?
[05:40] He hit me a lot
[05:42] so only you were left?
[05:47] Raazi?
[06:02] how dare you?
[06:05] Raazi, he had hit me a lot
[06:10] send him to jail and take everything from him
[06:15] take everything from him
[06:20] I will
[06:22] I will teach him a lesson
[06:25] But right now, do this ..
[06:31] sign here. Sign here
[06:35] What is it?
[06:37] they are divorce papers
[06:42] Sign here
[06:44] You can't live without money but if you want your life then sign here otherwise you'll spend your whole life in jail
[06:52] sign it
[06:54] I am signing
[07:03] here too
[07:12] Natasha? Natasha? You ..
[07:24] Do not look at Natasha again
[07:27] if you want to stay alive
[07:30] otherwise I'll kill you
[07:38] Natasha, don't you worry. We'll go to doctor, okay?
[07:44] have strength. Come on
[07:50] Get up! You can do it
[08:00] come! come!
[08:04] don't worry
[08:06] nothing happened to you. Everything is fine
[08:09] careful
[08:18] My ears are tired, Ramsha but you aren't done scolding me. Don't you feel pity at me?
[08:27] Did you really go to check your lands?
[08:29] I swear I did and I am exhausted
[08:33] then come back
[08:35] how far is Murree
[08:44] Do I look fine?
[08:51] No, not fine
[08:58] you look really beautiful
[09:02] Don't joke, Faizan. Tell me? Is my makeup over?
[09:07] why did you do makeup?
[09:09] there is no need, you are naturally beautiful
[09:16] are you saying it to make me happy?
[09:23] I can put hand on my heart and say it
[09:30] that you are the most beautiful girl in the world
[09:39] this makeup isn't important
[09:50] shall we go?
[09:51] Lets go
[10:26] Father won't let me enter home
[10:29] why?
[10:30] why not?
[10:32] he has disowned me
[10:37] he hasn't
[10:44] Look Natasha ..
[10:49] uncle might show anger 
[10:52] its his right
[10:54] what you did was very wrong
[10:58] also ..
[11:00] if parents are strict with their children, this doesn't mean ..
[11:06] that they are doing wrong. Its always beneficial for us
[11:11] look at your own example
[11:17] uncle was asking you not to marry Sherry, 
[11:21] but you did
[11:27] uncle was forcing you again and again but you still went ahead
[11:35] now see, what happened?
[11:38] uncle's decision was proven right
[11:42] he knew that you didn't deserve that guy
[11:46] anyways ..
[11:50] remember one thing
[11:54] when a person makes a mistake
[11:59] he should be ashamed of it
[12:02] and if not ashamed, he should at least apologize
[12:05] he won't forgive me
[12:08] why?
[12:09] why do you think this way?
[12:12] I know him. He stays on his word. He won't forgive me
[12:18] I know it well that uncle keeps his word
[12:24] but trust me, uncle's all decision are proven right till now
[12:30] Did uncle wrongly choose Hadia for Faizan? 
[12:43] So did he choose you rightly for me?
[12:55] what happened?
[12:57] umm .. nothing
[13:03] everything will be fine
[13:08] God willing
[13:30] Pick up the phone. Its ringing since long
[13:32] You go inside. I'll take the call and come. Its a client
[13:39] Come soon, its getting cold
[13:57] What is it, Ramsha?
[13:59] I will put hand on my heart and say ..
[14:02] that there is no other girl more beautiful in this world than you. 
[14:06] I only love you
[14:08] you don't need any artificial makeup or jewelry
[14:12] I like you the way you are
[14:16] Were you saying this all in a meeting?
[14:21] how did you hear it all?
[14:24] leave it. I already know everything from before
[14:29] that you aren't in Islamabad but in Muree with that Hadia
[14:33] but I didn't question you
[14:36] because I wanted you to tell me the truth
[14:39] but Faizan you keep lying to me
[15:14] O wow
[15:17] wonderful! 
[15:24] so you are still awake? did you see the pictures?
[15:27] Show them to mother and father too if they are awake
[15:31] greetings sister?
[15:32] I was awake because I was studying. I have seen your pictures. You both look amazing
[15:39] I pray that your pair never catches evil eye
[15:43] also, I'll go and show pictures to mother and father. They'd be very happy
[15:47] Take care! Bye
[15:55] how beautiful is she looking
[16:07] I can put my hand on my heart
[16:12] that you are the most beautiful girl in the world
[16:17] you don't need make up 
[16:29] are you awake?
[16:30] yes, come in
[16:32] is everything okay?
[16:34] Yes, sister sent pictures. I couldn't hold myself so came to show them to you. See
[16:40] Its good that you have come
[16:42] o wow! see
[16:45] mother, there was a Qawali night. So these pictures are of that event. Aren't they both looking good?
[16:51] they both are looking great
[16:52] it seems that Faizan was very happy while taking pictures
[16:56] yes, he was taking selfies with sister
[17:00] but my child, do one thing
[17:02] transfer all these pictures to my phone
[17:06] you would
[17:08] then go to hostel. We'd be able to see whenever we'd want.
[17:14] right father
[17:24] what happened, father? Why are you crying?
[17:26] no my child
[17:29] I'm not crying
[17:32] umm
[17:33] when we see our children happy
[17:36] us parents get teary eyed
[17:40] actually, when Hadia's proposal was fixed
[17:47] your mother had many doubts
[17:52] and because of that
[17:54] I was too scared
[17:58] and kept on praying to God
[18:02] that all these doubts are proven wrong
[18:08] My respect stays firm in my daughter's eyes
[18:14] and
[18:15] I think God has heard my prayers
[18:18] He helped me
[18:31] Do send
[18:35] yes mother
[18:38] its beautiful
[18:44] Ramsha, listen to me please
[18:46] Faizan, there is nothing left to hear now
[18:50] You are spending vacation with that Hadia. You are romancing and enjoying
[18:55] you are praising her
[18:58] and you left me after 2 hrs of wedding
[19:03] is this my value?
[19:05] this is why you weren't even picking up my phone
[19:08] and if you pick it by mistake, then you are in rush to go to spend time with that Hadia
[19:14] tell me one thing truly
[19:18] why did you marry me?
[19:21] Ramsha, we'll talk later. I'm very very very tired
[19:26] you aren't
[19:28] you are frustrated of me
[19:30] you are in love with that Hadia
[19:33] you want to get rid of me
[19:37] but get one thing
[19:40] I will not leave you so easily
[19:45] Look, if Hadia knew about you, I would have talked to you in front of her
[19:49] but you know about her, that she's in my life
[19:52] and its important to give her time
[19:55] and I brought her here because father asked me, otherwise I wouldn't have
[20:00] Lie! you are lying again and again.
[20:03] understand one thing well
[20:06] I'm not a fool
[20:07] and I don't believe anything of yours, understood?
[20:11] If you don't then don't, what do I do?
[20:14] and honestly, I don't believe that you are being desperate for my love
[20:20] its jealousy talking. You are jealous that I'm with Hadia and not you
[20:24] Faizan, you are insulting my love
[20:29] I purely love you
[20:31] pure love?
[20:33] Ramsha, those who love purely don't ask for 500 million rupees as a wedding gift
[20:38] Faizan, I told you that mother
[20:41] enough!
[20:42] you and your mother ..
[20:44] Are you telling me that this happened without your will? I don't believe it
[20:49] infact, I think you asked your mother about it
[20:54] Ramsha, there is nothing like this in love
[20:57] it is very pure
[20:59] money reduces love and trust
[21:06] till today, Hadia never asked me anything
[21:10] although she knows that I'm son of Safdar Kamal
[21:14] but she never asked anything
[21:17] Faizan, I ..
[21:19] enough!
[21:21] Ramsha, I won't ignore your right. But please ..
[21:28] don't force me to think that you only got married to me for my status and money
[22:01] are you standing here and listening to me? Don't you have any manners?
[22:04] Why did you lie to me?
[22:07] when did you come? What did you hear?
[22:10] These are basic manners and ethics, Hadia
[22:13] Faizan I ..
[22:14] what? Don't I have any privacy? Whom do I talk and what do I do? You should know everything?
[22:20] I should have the same right
[22:22] What has happened to you, Faizan? I just came to call you. I didn't hear anything
[22:31] Hadia, do not interfere in my personal matters next time
[22:39] never
[25:07] uncle?
[25:16] someone is here
[25:20] Natasha?
[25:32] mother?
[25:34] my daughter
[25:41] what happened?
[25:43] huh? Some accident happened?
[25:46] Raazi, tell me?
[25:47] what happened?
[25:51] don't you worry
[25:55] Just be thankful
[26:01] that Natasha is home for ever
[26:03] Thanks to God
[26:07] Where is he?
[26:08] He ran away ..
[26:10] What? How?
[26:12] Don't you worry
[26:14] I have filed a report in police station
[26:18] problem won't be solved by that only. We should go to police station
[26:22] uncle, I told you
[26:25] don't you worry
[26:31] these are divorce papers
[26:33] it has all the proofs
[26:39] this is an evidence for us
[26:44] that guy ..
[26:46] is a small thief not a big gangster
[26:51] police will catch him soon
[27:38] Ramsha?
[27:41] Ramsha?
[27:48] what happened my child? Did you talk to Faizan?
[27:51] what was he saying? When will he return?
[27:55] I don't know mother
[27:58] what is it?
[27:59] did you fight with Faizan again?
[28:07] Look, I told you before. This isn't time to fight
[28:13] He lied to me
[28:16] He betrayed me and broke my heart
[28:19] He's enjoying vacations with that Hadia
[28:22] and I'm alone here ..
[28:24] Look Ramsha, if you'd keep acting like this
[28:29] then Hadia will soon make place in his heart
[28:33] and you'd sit idle
[28:36] then you tell me mother, what do I do?
[28:39] Faizan should at least tell the truth. I'm his wife. This is my right
[28:45] My dear, why do you forget this?
[28:48] that Faizan's father forced him to marry 
[28:53] his father might have sent him on this trip
[28:56] forcefully
[28:57] huh?
[29:01] enough my child
[29:04] everything will be fine
[29:09] be strong
[29:17] father didn't even talk to me
[29:21] he didn't ask
[29:23] my child ..
[29:25] he's your father
[29:28] he's upset
[29:31] but when you'll go talk to him with love, he'd hug you happily
[29:39] come, I'll take you to room
[29:46] come
[29:51] come
[29:53] be careful
[30:04] your son is a here
[30:07] yes!
[30:33] no
[30:34] come!
[30:46] I'm scared
[30:49] why?
[30:52] He's your father. He loves you
[30:55] come
[30:56] I have hurt him a lot. He won't forgive me
[31:01] She doesn't deserve my forgiveness
[31:08] Safdar please ..
[31:14] The disappointment I had to face because of you ..
[31:19] I can't forget it
[31:22] what is it that I haven't done for your happiness and your luxuries?
[31:28] what did you do to me in return?
[31:34] stress ..
[31:37] problems .
[31:42] this is what you did
[31:47] is this how daughters are?
[31:50] who do this to their father ..
[31:54] what do I say?
[31:56] she ..
[31:59] I have not only taken her out of my house
[32:01] but my heart too
[32:05] Safdar ..
[32:08] where will she go? She has no one
[32:14] I don't know
[32:16] she can go anywhere
[32:18] I told you mother, he won't forgive me
[32:29] father?
[32:33] Please? Please, forgive me
[32:45] I know it ..
[32:47] that I have hurt you
[32:55] Please forgive me
[33:00] I made a huge mistake
[33:05] I'm not upset
[33:08] father ..
[33:10] I fold my hands
[33:12] Please forgive my old mistakes
[33:17] you are back home
[33:20] so think that I have forgotten anything
[33:25] I have forgiven you by heart ..
[33:28] now stop crying
[33:34] How did this happen?
[33:38] father ..
[33:40] Sherry ..
[33:43] he had hit me a lot
[33:45] he assaulted me
[33:56] I won't ..
[33:57] I won't spare him
[33:59] I will break those hands he hit you with
[34:04] savage
[34:06] father ..
[34:08] I did unfair with you all
[34:14] I made a huge mistake
[34:48] she is a lot better now
[34:54] but she's in depression. She needs mental peace
[35:00] I'm prescribing her anti-depressants. Give her regularly
[35:30] Take care of her. Call me if needed
[35:50] I'm sorry
[35:53] I spoke too much
[35:55] you should also trust me. It wasn't just my mistake but yours too
[36:00] what happened, Faizan
[36:02] I trust you a lot, more than myself. But I don't know what happens to you. You get hyper
[36:08] I know, I get hyper. Its a problem
[36:12] I'm really sorry
[36:14] forgive me
[36:16] Fine! But next time if you'd scold me, I'll be upset for ever
[36:22] fine, you can. But this won't happen I promise
[36:34] its father calling
[36:38] Yes, father? How are you? How is everyone at home?
[36:43] what?
[36:46] How is she? What happened to her?
[36:52] I did tell you that this would happen one day. But no one listen to me
[36:57] I did tell her to come home and apologize but she'd too proud
[37:02] what are you saying? He has ran away?
[37:07] Its insane. Fine! Don't worry
[37:12] Definitely! Okay ..
[37:16] bye!
[37:17] umm
[37:22] Faizan?
[37:32] Uncle was forcing you again and again but you still got married
[37:41] now see what happened?
[37:43] uncle's decision was proven right
[37:49] he knew that you don't deserve that guy
[37:53] how dare you?
[37:55] Raazi, he had beaten me up a lot. Send him to jail and take everything from him
[38:11] You thought that you won't marry me so no one would marry me?
[38:19] don't forget that I'm daughter of Safdar Kamal. 
[38:22] Remember this
[38:38] Be quiet! Get lost
