[01:43] Hello...
[01:44] You called?
[01:48] What was so important that you disturbed my meeting?
[01:52] You went to Malaysia saying it was a business tour, right?
[01:55] Where are you?
[01:56] Who are you to ask me that?
[01:58] Your wife.
[01:59] If you're my wife, then stay within your limits.
[02:01] I know my limits, Faizan,
[02:03] But maybe you are forgetting yours.
Being with a girl, even though you have a wife...
[02:08] Shut up Hadia!
[02:11] That won't do a thing. You can tell  father when he asks you where you were
[02:17] Are you blackmailing me?
[02:23] Go and tell father. If you do, then it will be very bad for you.
[02:28] If a girl's husband spends his time with some other girl...
[02:32] what can be worse for her?
[02:40] Hadia I'm warning you. You can tell father if you want, but then it will be very bad for you.
[02:49] Faizan...
[02:51] hello?
[02:58] Come on... what should I do with her?
[03:17] Hello mama, Hadia has learned that I've not reached Malaysia.
[03:21] Please handle her, she's saying that she'll tell her father.
[03:25] This should not happen, so please handle her. I'll explain things later.
[03:32] Okay, please.
[03:39] Yes...
[03:42] Why wasn't Hadia at the breakfast table?
[03:47] You remember that she had food poisoning, right?
[03:50] Oh yes, I remember...
[03:52] If you want, I can take an appointment with the doctor, or call him home.
[03:57] It's not like that, she even had some soup in the morning.
[04:01] I'll check in on her.
[04:06] Thank you.
[04:08] Razi, did you mention those important points to Faizan over the phone?
[04:13] No uncle, not yet.
[04:18] My dear, they are very important points, you should have discussed them with him.
[04:23] You're right Faizan's number is switched off.
[04:27] How could I have told him if his number is switched off?
[04:33] Alright, let me check.
[04:42] The tea is very good.
[04:46] Hello... son, why is your phone off?
[04:50] No father, my phone is switched on.
[04:53] Alright, Razi is calling you. He will discuss those points with you at the meeting.
[05:01] Okay?
[05:04] Razi, you can call him, his phone is switched on.
[05:08] Sure uncle, I think my cellphone is in the room, I'll call him.
[05:17] Sister, believe me, when she makes tea, it reminds me of your tea.
[05:26] The taste and smell are the same.
[06:18] What is the matter with you?
[06:23] What need was there for you to call him at night?
[06:27] Mind your business and stay within your limits.
[06:34] You know that your marriage with Faizan was a forced one, right?
[06:40] It's not because he had another girl in his life...
[06:45] It's because he's an ill-mannered boy and your uncle Safdar...
[06:50] it was his idea that if he gets married to a sober girl, he might get better.
[07:01] If you want importance in Faizan's life, then leave him be.
[07:06] Stop interfering in his matters.
[07:09] How can it be?
[07:12] I'm Faizan's wife, how can I tolerate him with someone else?
[07:18] And believe me, she's not a good girl. She's bleeding Faizan dry
[07:22] It does not concern you, what she's doing.
[07:27] Faizan likes her 
[07:30] and if you try making space in Faizan's heart, instead of this room...
[07:36] then maybe you might succeed.
[08:35] Greetings*
[08:44] Congratulations your daughter has gained admission to a medical college.
[08:51] Congratulations!
[08:55] It's one of the top universities, and they gave her admission almost immediately.
[09:02] That was bound to happen because of your amazing grades.
[09:13] What is the matter, mother? Why did you get sad?
[09:20] It's nothing...
[09:23] After marrying one daughter, I wanted the other one to stay with us for a few years.
[09:29] But you're leaving us so soon.
[09:32] I have a solution for that.
[09:36] Why don't we rent a small house in Karachi? 
[09:39] That way, all of us will still live together. Alright, father?
[09:44] My dear, it's not that easy, and it's not just about the house. 
[09:48] On top of that, we have our house here and we have our land to look after as well.
[09:54] We have our friends as well... I have to look after the school as well, I have to look after the school with them.
[10:01] I'll be very alone there. What will I do there?
[10:04] There will be other girls at the hostel and you can visit us at the weekend.
[10:11] Sometimes your mother will come and sometimes I will.
[10:15]  On top of that, Hadia lives there as well.
[10:17] You can visit her when you want.
[10:22] No father, after that day, I don't feel like going there. I won't go there.
[10:32] Alright, forget about it.
[10:34]  When you feel like it, you can talk to Hadia over the phone.
[10:38] That's alright, but if Safdar learns of this, he will send a car every weekend to get her.
[10:46] It would be better if he doesn't learn of this.
[10:50] We don't want any more favors from him!
[10:54] How long will we hide this?
[11:00] Let him find out, we don't need to hide this. We're not sinning.
[11:05] Fizza, won't go there. Even if he insists on you visiting them...
[11:11] go there in the morning and come back in the evening. And hire a car for yourself.
[11:18] Sure mother, alright. Don't worry, that's exactly what I'll do.
[11:25] I'll go and rest for a while.
[11:37] Why are you worrying? God will make everything alright?
[11:42] The meeting didn't go at all well.
[11:47] The things I send him there for gave no results.
[11:52] He switched off his phone.
[11:56] Razi could have briefed him but...
[12:03] Safdar, he just came home. Let him rest a while.
[12:09] Did he come by road...
[12:12] that he's tired? 
[12:14] He came back luxuriously. 
[12:16] And he didn't do the work I assigned him to do.
[12:21] He didn't complete it.
[12:27] And tell me, before leaving, you made huge promises about the strides you'll make. 
[12:34] And this is what you've done.
[12:37] It would have been better if I had handed this to Razi.
[12:42]  I lost a big deal. You have disappointed me.
[12:47] Very much so.
[12:55] Did you see him?
[12:58] Instead of being upset about my loss...
[13:04] He left so stubbornly. If only...
[13:09] if I had handed this over to Razi. If I had I would have gotten a result, of one hundred percent!
[13:14] Your son has disappointed me.
[13:59] Didn't anyone tell you that I had come here?
[14:01] I knew you were coming.
[14:06] Then...
Then what?
[14:14] You are beautiful...
[14:18] What's the point...
[14:20] when you have someone else in your heart?
[14:24] That's a misunderstanding. 
[14:26] She's a colleague of mine, whilst I was at the toilet, she picked up my call and that was it.
[14:34] Did you have a meeting at a club, at two in the morning?
Okay...
[14:40] She's Ramsha, she's a friend... among many friends.
[14:44] The same Ramsha you called your love and took her dancing.
[14:50] And you also send your love, millions of rupees every month...
[14:55] Do you call all your friends your love and send them money?
[15:00] You know I was trying to excuse myself, but you're not worthy of that.
[15:06] She is my friend... she's even more than that. Do whatever you want. 
[15:11] Do you want to tell father, he's outside go and tell him.
[15:17] For one instance think about what effect this will have on your life and what effect it will have on your life.
[15:25] When you go to your home in Hyderabad, after getting a divorce, what effect will it have on your old father and simple mother?
[15:32] In the society we live in, if the elder daughter gets divorced, the proposals stop coming for the younger sister as well. 
[15:37] And I want to replace you.
[15:40] I want you to do something, that will make you leave and let Ramsha take your place.
[15:46] So whatever you want to do or say...
[15:49] think long and hard before it.
[17:20] You're here from Hyderabad. 
[17:23] Will you stay at the hostel, or a relative's?
[17:26] I don't have any relatives here, so I'll stay at the hostel.
[17:30] You topped at your college as well, right?
Yes...
[17:33] That means you will give us a tough time.
Or we will give her a tough time.
[17:37] Oh really? Who's the smartest who will give me a tough time?
[17:40] Everyone is smart.
That's very good.
[17:58] What? You let her leave... 
[18:01] yes
[18:02] you've been yearning for her since morning like you'll do something about it.
[18:05] That's why I let her leave.
[18:07] This was your chance. I don't understand you.
[18:11] You will not understand.
[18:13] If I talk to her now, she would have learned that I like her. So I need to be careful...
[18:20] Let me be slow and gradual... and let her yearn for me as well.
[18:24] Alright, I understand, whatever you think is right.
[18:47] It's good you came here...
Are you just saying, or did I disturb you?
[18:52] Not at all.
[18:54] The thing is that I and my wife wanted to visit you. 
[18:58] I decided to call you first, and take your permission.
[19:02] Then I decided to have tea with you at your office.
[19:06] You're embarrassing me now... we'll have dinner together.
[19:10] No, we'll have dinner at home with our wives.
[19:14] If it's possible, you can invite your friend from Hyderabad as well. It was nice to meet him.
[19:21] Who... brother Aleem?
[19:24] Yes, your daughter-in-law's father. Your brother-in-law.
[19:29] The thing is that we have been her fans.
[19:36] We were thinking of finding a girl like her. 
[19:40] The thing is that we have taken a liking for brother Aleem's youngest daughter for our son, Aleem.
[19:48] And... I wanted to talk to you about it first.
[19:54] My wife has taken a liking to her as well. 
[19:57] My son is becoming a surgeon and he likes the fact that the girl belongs to the same field as well.
[20:06] Sure, why not? That's very good.
[20:14] Yes...
[20:19] Thank you.
[20:31] So... I wanted to ask you what you think about it.
[20:36] What can be better than this?
[20:39] She's an honorable and capable young woman. But as far as brother Aleem is concerned...
[20:49] I think he would want to marry her in Hyderabad.
[20:55] Besides the girl is completing her studies.
[20:59] Her education is not a problem.
[21:03] Nisar is studying as well. We'll marry him after his specialization. 
[21:07] Until then his daughter's studies will be completed as well.
[21:13] Talk to brother Aleem and send my message to him.
[21:20] Sure...
[21:24] Alright...
[22:04] Sister, you don't know how happy I am.
[22:08] I can imagine it with the joy in your voice.
[22:11] I don't need to see you, to know how happy you are.
[22:15] That's why I called you as soon as I got here...
[22:19] How's the room?
[22:21] The room is great. 
[22:23] I was so afraid of how I would spend five years without mom and dad. 
[22:29] But these years will pass by quickly.
[22:32] Oh really... tell me, when are you coming to visit?
[22:38] I don't feel like it... why don't you visit me?
[22:43] What do you mean?
[22:44] I mean, I don't feel like leaving the hostel...
[22:49] That's why I'm asking you to come here. That way you can see my room.
[22:52] I don't want to hear it. Coming Saturday you are visiting me.
[22:57] Sure sister. Alright, I'll call you before I come.
[23:02] Okay, farewell*
[23:13] What has happened?
[23:15] Did I make a mistake mentioning brother Aleem in this conversation?
[23:33] I'll get going now...
You just got here, the party is just getting started.
[23:38] If my father sees that I'm not home, then there will be a scene at home.
[23:43] You said that before coming here, you notified your home.
[23:45] I told mother. But father doesn't know. Do you know what he does nowadays
[23:51] He comes into my room and sees if I'm there or not.
[23:54] How backward is your dad?
[23:57] Don't ask...
[23:59] What a shock! 
[24:02] Will you not stay for me?
[24:07] Bye!
[24:12] She won't even look at you. But you can continue wasting your time on him.
[24:16] What shortage do I have?
[24:18] We both know that. She doesn't know you belong to a middle-class family.
[24:25] If she finds out, do you know what will happen?
[24:28] Listen, can you do something for me?
[24:32] What do you mean? Have you fallen in love with her?
[24:34] Can't you do anything for me?
[24:37] Out of the question! This will end in four days, and Natasha won't take long to kick you out.
[24:44] You're not that cool.
[25:00] Shina was completely right. What she feared has happened.
[25:07] What will happen now? How will I make her understand now?
[25:13] Safdar, what is the matter? You've been standing here for ages, what are you thinking about?
[25:21] Nothing.
[25:24] Is everything alright?
[25:27] Yes, everything is fine.
[25:30] It doesn't seem so...
[25:35] I was just worried about something at work.
[25:42] I told you to take care of yourself. Don't bring your office tensions home.
[25:52] Anyways... you had a meeting with Mr. Rehman today...
[25:57] Faizan told me that he came to the office today and you had lunch with him.
[26:02] Yes, that's true.
[26:05] The meeting went fine.
What did you talk to him about?
[26:11] Nothing, he came here to take my advice on a new business he's starting.
[26:21] Are you hiding something from me?
Why would I hide anything from you?
[26:25] Why are you being angry? I just asked you a few questions.
[26:29] Why do you probe so much? Why don't you believe me?
[26:34] I told you what was up, but you don't believe it.
[26:49] Where is Natasha coming from in the middle of the night?
[27:02] Who is that man with him?
[27:06] She went with her friend somewhere out...
[27:10] What get-together? Do you even know where she goes?
[27:16] Yes, I do... she went out with her friends. 
[27:20] She told me before she left, I forgot to tell you.
[27:24] Did you forget to tell me, or are you hiding it from me?
[27:28] Look, listen to this with open ears. 
[27:32] I'm very sensitive when it comes to my daughter.
[27:35] As a mother, you should know where she comes and goes.
[27:40] Don't be so careless when it comes to your children.
[27:44] It's not appropriate to have such behavior with adolescent children. I will not tolerate this!
[27:49] Safdar, I know that man, he's from a good background.
[27:53] And... don't think that something is going on between them. They are just friends.
[27:59] Shina... stop putting a veil over your useless children's deeds.
[28:05] This is enough!
[28:07] I won't tolerate it now. I want every information...
[28:11] on your children. I want to know where they go and sit. Especially your daughter.
[28:18] Because your love has spoiled our son. But our daughter...
[28:22] Have some sense... she will get married one day. What will you say to the world then?
[28:28] Go and ask her where she went and whom she was with.
[28:33] Relax...
I am relaxed. I'm not dead. Do as I say.
[29:06] Who was the man you came home with?
[29:13] Is it a crime to ask a guy to drop me home?
[29:17] Natasha, I want the answer to my question!
[29:23] What is the matter? Is this a home or a police station
[29:27] You started interrogating me as soon as I reached home...
Enough!
[29:33] Tell me, where you are coming from?
[29:35] I went out with friends, where else?
[29:39] There is a time to be with friends. I never know when you leave and come back...
[29:46] Your father saw you getting off that man's car.
[29:51] Mother, I've already told you, he was my friend, Sherry.
Look, Natasha...
[29:57] I am not suspecting you or your character...
[30:03] But your father, you know how conservative he has become.
[30:08] People talk as well...
[30:11] Honestly mother...
[30:13] I've had it enough... ever since we've to Pakistan, I feel so suffocated...
[30:20] Because father has a problem with everything. I don't know what's gotten into him...
[30:26] Why has he become so narrow-minded? 
[30:29] Honestly, I don't bloody care what people do or say?
[30:34] One has to care. We have to listen to the people and care about what they say, in the society we live in...
[30:42] Look, it's been a while since we came back to Pakistan...
[30:47] You have to...
Mother stop... I cannot right now... I'm losing it.
[31:10] Yes, she is my friend, she greater than that. She's greater than everyone. Do whatever you want. 
[31:15] Tell father, he's right outside.
[31:21] For one instance, what effect it will have on your life and what effect it will have on your life?
[31:30] After you get divorced and go back home to Hyderabad, what will your old father and simple mother go through?
[32:11] Faizan...
[32:12] What happened to you? Get up?
Who are you and what are you doing in my room?
[32:17] What?
[32:21] Who are you and what are you doing in my room?
[32:25] Go...
[32:27] Go out...
Where should I go?
[32:31] I don't care where you go, just go out of my room.
[32:34] What's gotten into you?
Just leave!
[33:13] What is the matter? Why is he screaming?
I don't know.
[33:19] Alright... I understand.
[33:23] He does this when he's in that state. 
[33:26] Leave him alone, he'll get better in the morning.
[33:31] You're his wife, you should know how to take care of him in this state.
[33:38] Anyways... he had some bad friends in the US, and because of this, he got into these bad habits.
[33:47] But I have hope that he will soon leave these habits behind.
[33:52] Being his wife, you will help him lose these bad habits.
[34:00] One more thing, 
[34:02] I hope that you will not mention this to Safdar, or your family.
[34:12] That's what I like about you...
[34:15] that you're patient and you don't overreact.
[34:24] Good wives, don't talk badly about their in-laws, at their parent's house.
[34:31] Do you understand?
[34:35] Yes...
[34:39] Agreed?
[35:57] You just can't help yourself. 
[36:00] She's Fizza Aleem from Hyderabad, and she's from a middle-class family.
[36:04] Enough, I don't want to send a proposal to her. I just want her number.
[36:11] I know men like you. You just want to play your game.
[36:18] But there is one thing, it won't be easy to trap that girl. It will take time.
[36:25] She seems very intelligent and confident. She doesn't seem from a small city.
[36:30] I heard that she was a topper in her college.
I see...
[36:36] Let's go to the cafeteria.
[36:51] Samreen... did you see that girl looking at us. He's been looking at us for a while
[36:56] She's looking back.
[36:59] He's not looking at us, he's looking at Fizza. I noticed him looking at her yesterday as well.
[37:04] He was staring at Fizza. I think he has his heart set on Fizza.
[37:10] Don't talk about nonsense, what's the matter with you?
[37:12] Your beauty is enough for any guy to fall for you.
[37:19] I know how to set guys like him straight. I'll be right back.
[37:23] Where are you going?
[37:26] To set him straight.
No need to waste your breath on him.
[37:34] I think he's a true lover.
He's so rude.
[37:39] He's continuously staring at me, even though I'm angry. Guys like him should be set straight.
[37:45] Leave him be, don't waste your breath on him. Don't allow him to say anything.
[37:53] Besides, it's not your fault, it's your beauty's fault.
[37:58] Enough... let's go away from here. I feel very comfortable.
[38:16] Leave it, there's no point.
[38:19] Why?
I don't think you'll succeed.
[38:22] You don't know how good I am.
[38:25] Did you see her eyes? She'll eat you alive.
Watch me...
[38:30] Sure...
[38:40] What should I do to bury this here?
[38:44] If Shina learns of this, she'll create a scene.
[38:49] She's already against brother Aleem and his family.
[38:53] She has not yet accepted Hadia.
[38:57] And if she learns of this...
[39:02] she will get even angrier at me.
[39:06] No... this should not happen.
[39:11] This will not only affect my friendship with brother Aleem. 
[39:15] This also had a bad effect on Hadia and Faizan.
[39:19] Natasha's heart will break as well.
[39:22] I will not let this happen.
[39:28] I should talk to brother Aleem. He's a smart man...
[39:33] He will make a valid excuse and refuse him.
[39:39] Why would he refuse a good proposal? 
[39:42] It's hard to find a good bachelor like Nisar.
[39:46] It's true when they say that one can buy every luxury...
[39:53] but not the happiness and luck of one's children.
[39:59] Brother Aleem will have to cater to my friendship. I've done him many favors.
[40:06] How can he marry his daughter to a place, where I was hoping to marry my daughter to?
