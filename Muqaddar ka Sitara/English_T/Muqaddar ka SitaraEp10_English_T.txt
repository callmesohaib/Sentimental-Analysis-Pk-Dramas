[01:51] What are you thinking?
[01:55] Why are you putting henna on me right now? 
[01:59] We could do it at night.
[02:03] I'll put it again, it'll give you more color. 
[02:08] I don't know what sort of henna we get these days. There's no color.
[02:11] You're worried aren't you?
[02:17] You feel as if I'd run away.
[02:21] Had this been, I wouldn't have sent you to the salon with Fizza.
[02:26] I would have taken you myself.
[02:29] I trust you my dear.
[02:33] How will I live there? He stays in the same house.
[02:44] If your character is strong,
[02:47] nothing is difficult.
[02:52] But I will definitely ask him. Why did he do this to me?
No dear.
[02:59] Not at all. If you do this, it will raise questions on your character.
[03:06] Your upbringing will be questioned.
[03:41] Hello?
Faizi, its been a mess. Ramsha has attempted suicide.
[03:46] What?
You would never agree but she really loves you.
[03:51] She cannot live without you. Her mother called.
[03:55] From Dubai. She is in critical condition.
Why? Why?!
[04:11] What happened Faizan? What are you doing? Who attempted suicide?
[04:20] Why did you stop the car? What happened?
[04:25] Razi get off the car.
[04:28] What happened Faizan?
Get off the car.
[04:31] Faizan?
Razi get off the car please.
[04:50] How could you?! How could you!
[05:03] Whats wrong Razi? Its been so late, where are you people?
[05:07] Uncle, Faizan went to a friend of his.
[05:11] Which friend?
I don't know someone named Zohaib.
[05:15] He was talking on the phone and I heard one of his friends attempted suicide.
[05:22] What?
[05:24] Suicide attempt.
Uncle I don't know but I think aunt would know. Please ask her.
[05:32] Yes I'll ask her.
Okay. Bye.
[05:41] Sheena? Sheena?
[05:50] Yes.
It happened. Whatever I was afraid of.
[05:55] What do you mean? What are you saying?
[05:59] Your son has run away from the wedding.
[06:06] What are you saying? I don't understand. At least tell me what has happened?
[06:57] Faizan told me that he'll not marry that girl at any cost. He's sitting right next to me.
[07:20] He's tired trying to call you.
[07:23] But don't answer him yet. I told him that you're in the ICU. He's really worried for you.
[07:37] That's great Zohaib. Thank you so much. Listen, I'm coming to Pakistan on the first available flight.
[07:57] No don't. I told Faizi you're in a critical condition. If you come right away, Faizi will be in doubt.
[08:05] You will have to be very careful in this game. Wait for my next message.
[08:27] Your phone is ringing. Its Razi. Answer it. It must be something important.
[08:43] Yes tell me what is it?
Where are you Faizan?
[08:46] What does it matter, why did you call?
Do you even realize how much uncle is worried for you?
[08:52] So what is it to you? He's my dad.
Don't be nonsensical Faizan.
[08:58] Wherever you are, come back fast. Everybody is waiting for you.
[09:01] I'm not coming. I will not come home, do whatever you want to do.
[09:08] Do you even realize you're getting married today.
[09:10] What wedding are you talking about? I'll not get married. Tell dad, I'm not getting married.
[09:19] Have you lost your mind?
[09:21] Yes I have. What will you do? I will not get married. I will not marry the girl he chose.
[09:27]  Its because of him Ramsha is fighting for her life in the hospital.
[09:30] Whoever that girl is Faizan, why didn't you take a stand earlier? 
[09:34] Neither would that girl try to commit suicide nor would your to-be bride's life be destroyed. 
[09:39] Listen to me Faizan.
[09:42] See Faizan, if you don't want to get married, come and talk to your father so that he'll talk to Aleem uncle.
[09:51] Its the matter of someone's respect. A girl's life will be destroyed. 
[09:55] I'm asking you to come back in half an hour or...
[10:00] Or what? What can you or anybody else do?
[10:22] Was he calling you?
[10:26] Faizi don't listen to him. He's manipulating you because of your father.
[10:34] He's right. I should go. I should talk to dad. Its enough now.
[10:44] And if your dad convinces you again, will you get married then?
No way.
[10:50] If he hadn't done this thing about the money. Had he not paid Ramsha to leave, I might have listened to him but not anymore.
[11:00] Not now. I'm being stubborn now. I'll see how he gets me married now.
[11:33] Didn't you tell Aleem that I didn't want this trash furniture. 
[11:39] Wasn't it enough that his daughter was coming here that he sent all this trash along?
[11:47] I don't have enough space in the storeroom. Where will I keep all this?
[11:55] What happened?
Nothing.
[11:59] Is everything alright.
[12:01] Yes, everything is alright. I'm just a little upset thinking my daughter will leave today.
[12:12] Are you hiding something from me? 
[12:17] You do know I'm not satisfied with this relationship at all.
[12:23] He is not right for our Hadia.
Khadijah push out these doubts from your heart.
[12:35] But you..
[12:37] No ifs or buts now. Get ready. Its getting late. 
[12:43] The wedding procession will be here any moment.
[13:00] For God's sake, can someone tell me where Zohaib lives? Please.
Call him. Maybe he'll answer.
[13:09] I've been calling him for a while now but he isn't answering.
[13:14] Let him come home. What does he think of himself?
[13:17] I've been telling you Faizan is against this marriage but you want to force him.
[13:24] You should be quiet.
Why? Because I'm telling the truth?
[13:27] Uncle, aunt is right.
[13:30]  If Faizan loved someone else, you should have gotten him married to her. 
[13:36] Why are you destroying someone else's life?
[13:40] Yes Safdar, they're right. We cannot force someone to get married. God forbid, what if he says no,
[13:49] how will brother Aleem show his face to everyone? He'll be insulted.
[13:56] Dad, I think we're just wasting our time arguing.
[14:01]  Instead of calling Faizi we should call them and tell them we're not coming.
[14:07] This cannot be. We will go, listen to that. I'm going to find him myself.
[14:15] Where were you? Where were you? 
[14:20] We've been looking for you since forever. Where were you?
[14:25] Faizan what have you done to yourself?
[14:28] We're asking you. Answer us!
[14:39] You are a cheat. 
[14:42] You cheated me and Ramsha. 
[14:48] She's critical because of you. She's suffering.
[14:52] This means, you're still in touch.
I'm sorry.
[15:01] But I will not get married. Do whatever you want to do.
[15:04] Are you still in contact with that girl?
[15:08] Yes I am.
Just shut up!
[15:17] How dare you raise your voice in front of me. 
[15:22] Get out of my house right now. Razi call the lawyer. I'll cut him off right now.
[15:33] Safdar control yourself, you're angry right now.
[15:36] How dare he answer me back?! How dare he? Why aren't you calling? Call right now.
[15:53] I'll not be scared of your threats. Do you know what? You're a terrible father.
[16:05] This wedding will not happen and this is my final decision.
[16:14] Safdar. Get some water. Hurry up. Safdar, be strong.
[16:23] Safdar be strong. Everything will be alright. Hurry up!
[16:30] What face will I show to brother Aleem? 
[16:36] He hasn't left me able to show face anywhere.
[16:48] I will not get married. No matter what.
[16:54] Rather than calling Faizi we should call them that we're not coming.
[17:49] Hello?
How are you?
[17:54] Why did you call me?
[17:57] I had a relationship with you and that relation forced me to call you.
[18:04] That relation was very temporary and worthless. I have forgotten it. You should too.
[18:09] You won't believe.
[18:13] That I have not been able to forget you even for a single moment.
[18:18] Even though you deceived me.
[18:23] You talked to me all day and made me realize that maybe you liked me.
[18:34] What was all that?
[18:38] Was that okay?
You're the one who deceived me. Not me.
[18:44] What do you mean?
[18:52] What are you saying?
[18:52] I don't want to argue about it. Also you're forgetting I'm marrying your cousin today.
[19:00] What if this doesn't happen?
What do you mean?
[19:05] I mean, what if fate wants us to be together?
[19:11] What if it wants to provide us a chance to be together?
[19:15] This cannot happen.
This can happen Hadia.
[19:21] Nobody knows whats in our fate.
[19:26] There is a lot of power in true love 
[19:30] and my love and emotions for you were honest.
[19:39] And its some other thing that you only passed your time with me.
[19:42] Enough. You're crossing your limits.
[19:47] I will not allow you to insult me anymore.
[20:13] Brother..
[20:14] Brother, uncle is calling you. Come fast.
[21:06] Uncle please be strong. You'll fall sick.
[21:11] What does he think of himself?
Safdar you need to be strong.
[21:15] The wedding procession is ready and he says no to the wedding. He doesn't know me.
[21:20] I will throw him out. What will he do?
You guys also decided without thinking things through.
[21:26] You didn't even take his consent. Did you see how this forced relationship turned out?
His consent?
[21:33] You don't know about his friendships at all. 
[21:37] What if he had befriended a random girl and brought him home as his wife?
[21:42] That's fine but now think what should we do?
[21:45] You know Aleem is my dear old friend.
[21:49] He has always supported me more than he could afford. Is it less that,
[21:53] he gave his eligible daughter to my son?
[21:58] How will it affect him if I say no to this wedding at the last moment? What will he think?
[22:04] Even though his wife didn't support the proposal
[22:08] What should I do?
[22:10] What can we do now? Think about something.
[22:14] What will we do now?
I don't understand what should we do?
[22:32] Sister.
[22:35] Razi is like my son.
[22:40] If you think its alright, we'll get Razi married to Aleem's daughter.
[22:56] What.. What are you saying Safdar?
[23:34] You might not believe this.
[23:38] I hadn't been able to forget you for even a single second.
[23:44] This means, what if fate wants us to be together?
[23:49] What if fate wants us to be together and is giving us an opportunity? True love is very powerful.
[23:58] My love and emotions for you were absolutely real.
[24:13] What did you think and say no at the last minute? What if your dad actually throws you out?
[24:20] He will do nothing. He's just blackmailing me. And I don't care whether he throws me out.
[24:28] You've lost your mind. You don't know your father's anger.
[24:34] But you don't know that Ramsha is in the ICU because of him.
[24:40] I am his son. I'll do whatever he does to me, with him.
[24:47] Why are you behaving as if you'd die without that girl? 
[24:51] You don't even care about your dad's respect.
[24:55] And whatever he did. Was it right?
[24:58] Its because of him I was insulted in front of all my friends. 
[25:02] I made a commitment to Ramsha, what about that?
[25:06] Are you taking revenge from your father?
Yes. Think if you want to think that.
[25:13] This way he will not be able to enforce his decision on me.
[25:18] Mom, dad is getting Razi married instead of Faizi.
[25:25] See, you took your dad's anger lightly.
[25:29] Do you know how fast he is to decide things? He isn't blackmailing you.
[25:37] He will definitely do that. Right now its the question of his dear friend and his own respect.
[25:45] And if Razi supports him and keeps his respect intact.
[25:50] Do you even realize, how much he will respect Razi and how much he'll value all of them?
[25:57] He will give that penniless Razi all his wealth.
[26:02] Please for God's sake Faizan. Listen to me and understand me.
[26:08] Right now don't take any rash decision because you're angry. Try and understand.
[26:26] This color suits you very well. You look beautiful.
[26:31] Our daughter is so pretty. All colors suit her.
This is true.
[26:37] She looks very pretty as a bride. Isn't it?
[26:41] You really know how to talk. I'm thinking we should tell your dad that Hadia will leave now,
[26:47] We should think about getting you married as well.
Mom, what is wrong with you?
[26:53] She isn't married yet and you're talking about getting me married.
[26:57] As it is, I'll not leave you and dad so easily. Hadia, tell mom and dad that I want to study.
[27:04] I'll be a big doctor and no wedding until then.
Alright doctor.
[27:16] The color looks good and the makeup is good as well.
Yes.
[27:26] The crossroads you've reached because of your son, I can realize that.
[27:36] After Razi's father passed, you never let him feel he didn't have a father.
[27:45] And I'll never forgo this. But Safdar,
[27:52] don't put my son through this test.
[28:01] I cannot do this. Please forgive me.
[28:31] Lets go Safdar. We'll take the wedding procession. They'll be waiting for us.
[28:46] I'm ready. Lets go.
[28:51] Think and decide. I don't want you to take this decision because you know I'll through you out.
[29:01] And what if you say no later. I will not tolerate it.
[29:07] I'll stand by my decision. Don't worry.
[29:19] Both of you get ready as well. I don't want any more problems. Come on we're already late. Come out. I'm waiting.
[30:51] Hadia?
[31:15] Dear I, wanted to talk to you about something.
[31:23] See you're getting married today and going to your house. You'll start your married life.
[31:37] Dear, to make life successful, both husband and wife have to try but its good if a girl tries and compromise. Its good that way.
[32:00] Dear, keep one thing in mind.
[32:08] Think of your husband as your pride, your trust and your peace.
[32:21] And try that he doesn't have any complaints from you.
[32:30] See, God has given women a lot of abilities.
[32:39] A woman can change the atmosphere anywhere and adapt to any atmosphere.
[32:55] Everything is now depending on you, what you want.
[33:04] I know that Safdar's house and their ways are different than ours.
[33:20] And I know that the initial days will be difficult for you.
[33:32] But I believe that you will be able to make room for yourself in their hearts with your softness and warmth.
[33:45] And even if there is any problem you'll be able to solve it with your cool mind.
[33:57] Dear, whatever is going on in your mind right now, if you have any questions, 
[34:04] just take them out 
[34:07] and hope for the best. 
[34:12] God has planned the best for you.
[34:20] Do you understand what I'm saying dear? 
[34:25] May God keep you happy and blessed my child.
[36:51] Its very late Safdar. Ask brother Aleem to bring the bride and get done with everything.
[36:59] Whats wrong Sheena?
[37:02] Its your son's wedding. 
[37:04] We will sign the marriage contract and then there will be a photo session.
[37:08]  It'll take time. Whats wrong?
[37:11] I'm in a hurry I cannot stay in this chaos for long. It irritates me.
[37:16] I'm feeling the same. Its very chaotic.
[37:23] At least shut these drums. They're giving me a headache. The welcome is done. Whats the need now?
[37:29] Its a wedding event and that's synonymous with happiness. 
[37:35] Whats wrong with your people? 
[37:39] At least let me have peace here. 
[37:44] Now fix your mood everyone.
