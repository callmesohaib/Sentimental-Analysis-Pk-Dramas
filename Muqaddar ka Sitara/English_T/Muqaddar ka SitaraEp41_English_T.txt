[00:57] Najma... what is the matter? Why isn't breakfast served yet?
[01:01] It will be ready soon.
Where's Hadia?
[01:05] She's in her room.
[01:07] Alright. What about Faizan?
He's not at home.
[01:12] Not at home?
[01:15] Go and call Hadia to come downstairs and have breakfast.
[01:29] Was Razi telling the truth about Faizan?
[01:37] What should I do about him?
[01:47] Pick up, Faizan. What will I tell your father?
[01:52] Hello Faizan... where are you?
[01:56] Father is asking about you.
[02:00] Hurry up!
[02:04] Bye.
[02:10] All everyone does is worry me.
[02:27] Faizan, why are you leaving so soon?
[02:31] It's important, that's why.
What about me?
[02:35] Am I not important to you?
[02:39] When did I say that?
Try saying it then...
[02:44] Try telling me sometimes that I'm the only important thing to you.
[02:50] At least lie to make me happy.
[02:55] Why would I lie?
[03:01] I find peace with you, that's why I come here.
Then please don't go.
[03:08] We'll spend the day together and have breakfast at a nice place.
[03:14] Not today, some other day perhaps.
If you don't like going out, let me make breakfast for you.
[03:21] Please understand. Everyone suspects me today and I don't want that suspicion to turn into belief.
[03:27] I have to go.
[03:30] Alright, go!
[04:30] Hadia..
[04:36] I need to talk to you.
[05:40] Hadia, I only wanted to tell you that...
[05:45] you don't need to be worried by Faizan anymore.
[05:50] Think that whatever evidence he had against us is no more.
[06:00] Hadia, I only wanted to tell you that...
[06:05] you don't need to be worried by Faizan anymore.
[06:10] Think that whatever evidence he had against us is no more.
[06:22] What Faizan did, he did, but what you did to me wasn't right either. If you hadn't complained, then Faizan wouldn't have done anything as well.
[06:30] It's his business how many times he lies to his father. What need do you have to be a hero?
[06:45] I don't want to become a hero.
[06:48] I just want to tell you to not be worried.
[06:55] How can I believe you?
[07:01] Please trust me.
[07:07] I don't trust anything you say.
[07:55] Khadija, I'm leaving for work.
[08:08] What is the matter? Will you not escort me out today?
[08:16] Khadija?
[08:20] If you are not well...
[08:25] then I can stay.
[08:32] Will you not say anything?
[08:36] I told you so many times.
[08:42] I refused.
[08:45] I asked you not to marry Hadia there, but you didn't listen to me once.
[08:53] Now, look how unhappy my daughter is there.
[09:02] What happened? Did Hadia say something to you?
[09:08] Hadia never says anything.
[09:12] She endures everything silently.
[09:16] But...
[09:18] I know...
[09:22] You are being scared for no reason.
I'm not scared.
[09:31] Why do you ignore everything I say? Why do you think that everything I say is nonsense?
[09:40] I'm her mother.
[09:43] I know the state of my daughter's heart.
[09:47] Alright... don't worry. God willing, everything will get better.
[09:55] How can I not worry?
[10:01] What do you think...
[10:05] Do you think I'm wrong?
[10:11] Look... one should always hope for the best.
[10:18] Always expect the best from God...
[10:22] I'm sure that God will never leave our daughter alone.
[10:28] Besides, my daughter is not alone there. I believe that God is with her.
[10:37] Besides, we have another daughter, and we can't ignore her.
[10:45] She has to go meet Nisar as well. It would be better if you talk to her.
[10:54] Sure...
[10:56] This way you will feel better...
[11:02] Don't worry about Hadia, God will make everything alright.
[11:09] When you talk to Fizza ask her if she needs anything. If she does, I'll send it to her.
[11:21] Alright? I'll get going now.
[11:49] Father...
[11:52] I wanted to talk to you.
Sure my dear, sit down.
[11:57] What is it?
Father...
[12:01] If you allow me to, I would like to go to Hyderabad for a few days.
[12:08] I miss my mother and father.
[12:12] My dear, you can go whenever you want. You don't need to take permission.
[12:22] But you going like this won't be appropriate.
[12:28] You're not well and you need rest.
[12:33] Besides you're upset. I donâ€™t want your...
[12:41] parents to know about what happened.
[12:49] Do you know that...
[12:52] parents can...
[12:57] know the sadness of their children from their faces.
[13:02] Brother Aleem is a dear friend of mine.
[13:09] I don't want to be ashamed in front of him, because I promised him that...
[13:16] I will not tears appear in her daughter's eyes.
[13:20] I...
[13:25] don't want him to know that I was unsuccessful in keeping my promise.
[13:34] Don't worry. No one will no anything.
[13:41] I'm not worried about you my dear.
[13:46] But I...
[13:49] I'm ashamed.
[13:54] Very much so.
[13:57] I won't say that...
[14:01] Faizan is naive. He is responsible for his actions, good or bad. He is answerable to them...
[14:11] and he is answerable... to you and his God.
[14:21] Parents...
[14:25] are compelled by their children.
[14:30] You will learn that soon, as you'll be a parent soon.
[14:36] It's the same way for me as well...
[14:40] My dear...
[14:43] I'm compelled.
[14:49] And... I request you...
[14:54] to give Faizan one more chance. Maybe he'll get better when he becomes a father.
[15:01] My dear, on behalf of him, I beg you for forgiveness.
Father...
[15:06] Don't embarrass me, I have no complaints against you...
[15:14] No, my dear...
[15:18] I'm ashamed in front of you.
[15:22] May God always keep you happy.
[15:30] I...
[15:33] I don't trust Faizan, nor him, or Natasha,
[15:44] As far as your respect and honor are concerned...
[15:48] As far as you standing in this house is concerned, you are not at all behind Natasha in any way.
[15:56] In my eyes, you are equal to her.
[16:02] I trust you more than my children.
[16:09] Whatever Faizan did to you...
[16:14] he will regret it. Whatever he said...
[16:20] was a grave sin.
[16:34] Father...
[16:37] I never want to become a cause of your worries.
[16:42] I will not go to Hyderabad. I will stay here with you.
[16:53] I have no worries about you.
[16:59] You can go.
[17:03] I trust you.
[17:06] Go.
[17:08] Bless you.
[17:12] Take care of yourself.
[17:40] I'm sorry father, I'm really sorry that I lied about my admission.
[17:51] I just wanted to impress you, that's why I lied. There was no other reason.
[17:56] I promise I'll get admitted into a university this time.
What about your girlfriend?
[18:03] All of that is a lie. Razi is lying, it's not like that at all.
[18:07] I'm happy Hadia, I love her. I'm sincere and loyal to her. My family is about to get completed, there is no reason for me to leave her.
[18:17] I swear that I have no girlfriend.
[18:22] Safdar believe him, why would he lie?
[18:28] Your fake admission holds no importance to me.
[18:32] You have lied many times to me before and you have hurt me a great deal, many times before.
[18:39] But this time...
[18:43] Faizan, you have crossed all limits.
[18:46] Even after your wedding, you had affairs. I could never think you could stoop so low.
[18:55] You alleged your kind wife. I will find out about your affair, but...
[19:04] as far as I'm concerned about the allegations you made about Hadia...
[19:09] for that, you will apologize to her.
[19:15] And if you can't do that, then pick up your stuff and leave not this house, but my life as well.
[19:22] Safdar...
Don't get in between Shina.
[19:36] Alright, father, I am willing to apologize to Hadia.
[19:46] Natasha, call everyone in the house.
[19:59] Why is that?
When he alleged her in front of everyone...
[20:03] then he will have to apologize in front of everyone. 
[20:08] Go, Natasha.
[20:56] Mother... why didn't you come down for breakfast?
[21:01] I'm not hungry.
How will you take your medicine if you don't eat? Please eat.
[21:09] Where's Razi?
Maybe he's outside.
[21:24] Who is it?
[21:28] It's Hadia's mother.
Why aren't you picking up?
[21:32] What will I say to her?
[21:36] She must be calling for her daughter. What shall I tell her?
[21:44] I can't bring myself to talk to her.
Sister Hadia didn't come to breakfast today as well.
[21:51] She had breakfast in her room as well today.
[21:55] What's happening to her is not good. I feel sorry for her.
[22:01] My dear, why don't you go and sit with her for a while? That might make her feel a little better.
[22:08] She had no one here. She doesn't have her mother and sister. Who can she share her pain with?
[22:17] Faizan is not doing right by her.
[22:23] May God give guidance to Faizan.
[22:26] Amen... what else can we expect from brother Faizan?
[22:33] Yes... one can bear to lose everything, but not one's honor.
[22:40] I trust brother Razi, he can never do anything wrong. Brother Faizan did this on purpose.
[22:51] But he has sowed the seed of doubt in everyone's heart.
[22:56] He has done what he wanted to do. You are unaware of the cruel tricks of this world.
[23:03] You cannot see what I'm seeing.
[23:16] Auntie, father is asking you two to come downstairs.
[23:24] Sure, alright.
Farwa, where's Razi? Father is asking for him as well.
[23:30] He must be on the lawn, I'll call him.
I'll do that.
[23:34] Wait.
[23:37] Farwa, go and call Razi...
[23:49] Sure.
[24:55] I'm sorry Hadia, I shouldn't have said what I said.
[25:01] I want to apologize for that.
[25:12] Faizan... apologize to Razi as well.
[25:27] Out of the question. I can be wrong about Hadia, but I'm sure of what I said about Razi.
[25:38] I will not apologize to him. You can oust me if you want. I don't care.
[25:45] It's okay uncle.
[25:47] I don't need his apologies.
[25:55] It's enough that he's ashamed of what he did.
[26:04] I'm not ashamed! Ashamed at what?
[26:14] Silence yourself. You know what I'm saying is the truth!
[26:19] And I will prove that you have bad intentions toward my wife Hadia!
Faizan!
[26:26] You're being ill-mannered.
No, I'm not! I'm only answering it.
[26:32] Don't think that your son is an honorable man. I will unveil his face to everyone soon.
[26:40] I'm not saying much because my wife's name is involved in this, otherwise, I would have told everyone what a vile man you are.
[26:48] You're crossing all limits. My silence doesn't mean you can say whatever you want.
[26:54] You know I have reasons for saying these things. You know I have proof.
[27:02] Proof? Show it then?
[27:07] Where is your proof?
[27:11] I will... I will who it in front of everyone.
[27:15] Just wait and watch. I will prove to everyone that he's a snake in the grass.
[28:57] I will prove to everyone that he's a snake in the grass.
[30:04] I will unveil his true face to everyone. I'm not saying much because my wife's name is attached to all this.
[30:11] Otherwise, I would have told everyone how vile a man you are.
[30:18] You must be sad about what brother Faizan said.
[30:34] My sadness isn't anything... 
[30:39] in front of the pain that Hadia felt.
[30:41] Brother... you're still worried about her pain. you don't care about yourself.
[30:49] Hadia is in pain because of me.
[30:56] But, it was important to tell uncle about this, otherwise, brother Faizan would have kept on betraying sister Hadia.
[31:05] That's what he's taking revenge for.
[31:12] Can you not clear all of this with brother Faizan?
[31:20] Things can only be cleared with people who realize their mistakes.
[31:27] All Faizan wants to do is defame me in front of my uncle. He only wants to put a veil on his mistakes.
[31:35] He doesn't know that this will only harm him.
[31:47] I was only silent because of Hadia today. Because Hadia doesn't want to drag this out further.
[31:58] I don't want to cause her any more pain.
[32:02] Brother, even after all that happened you only care about her.
[32:12] I only want to see Hadia happy.
[32:16] Only happy.
[32:21] She was very happy with Faizan, but I don't know what happened. That man doesn't care for her...
[32:29] That man doesn't even care for his unborn child.
[32:33] It's unfair...
Brother...
[32:37] If only she could have seen your honesty and good intentions the same way...
[32:46] It's hard. Very hard.
[32:55] It is hard.
[33:06] But not impossible.
[33:43] Faizi, why aren't you eating? Eat this.
[33:48] Thank you.
[33:53] Sir, your bill.
[34:00] Faizi, where is your attention? The food has gone cold, what's wrong with you?
[34:07] Pack it up, your mother will eat it up.
Excuse me...
[34:11] Why would my mother eat our leftovers?
[34:16] I'm sorry... I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry.
[34:21] Sir, your card is not working.
What do you mean? Try again, your machine must not be working
[34:27] I've tried multiple times, kindly please pay in cash, sir.
[34:38] Who keeps cash nowadays...
[35:23] Mother, where's father? Is he okay now?
[35:29] He just took his medicine and went to sleep.
[35:33] I didn't expect this from Faizan.
[35:38] I wasn't expecting that as well. It was fine when it was just words, but seeing him being physical with him...
[35:44] I didn't expect that.
So absurd. Faizan is the one at fault here.
[35:53] I don't know what problem he has with Razi.
It's Razi's fault as well. This situation is like this because of him.
[36:03] What's wrong with you? Why do you always blame Razi? Why don't you try to make Faizan understand?
[36:10] Because he's wrong and I will blame him. I don't want to hear his name from you again, understand?
[36:16] What's wrong with you? Why do you always against what I like?
[36:22] Because you choose everything that is not of our status.
Razi is not a thing. I like him.
[36:30] And don't even talk about Faizan. Where is he all day? So much has happened and you're still scolding me. You didn't say a word to him.
[36:41] It's good that father blocked his cards.
[36:50] What kind of children are they? They are each other's enemies.
[37:02] Whenever your father is upset at you, he blocks your card.
[37:11] He doesn't care about me. He boasts about his wealth.
[37:21] Forget about it. He's your father, don't be upset at him.
[37:26] I know he's my father, but this is wrong.
[37:31] How will I manage our expenses?
[37:36] Faizan, don't worry about my expenses. I will get by.
[37:42] I will not complain to you.
[37:48] Thank you.
[37:50] Ramsha, I have always misunderstood you...
[37:56] you're very good.
It's alright. I'm just glad that you finally realize that.
[38:04] Better late than never.
[38:08] Should I give you some advice?
[38:11] What?
Whenever your card activates, withdraw cash and keep it aside.
[38:17] So that you don't face any worry again.
[38:22] That is a very good idea. I'll do that.
[38:28] Now tell me the real reason...
[38:32] Why did your father do this to you?
I told you... Razi told him about us.
[38:40] I think there is another reason. If that were the case, he would have investigated where I was.
[38:48] Faizan, you are hiding something from me. I've started noting that you're upset at Hadia all the time as well.
[38:55] It's not like that.
[38:57] Everything is alright with Hadia.
[39:03] We only have small arguments. Everything else is alright.
[39:07] Faizan please, you can trust me.
[39:11] Why don't you tell me the truth?
[40:17] Where are you coming from?
How's that your business?
[40:21] I'm your wife.
[40:24] Really?
[40:26] I was just with my girlfriend.
[40:30] Go and tell father. Why don't you tell Razi, and he'll tell father.
[40:40] I'm disappointed in you and your thinking.
[40:45] Who stopped you? Be as disappointed as you want.
[40:52] But don't expect anything from me.
[40:58] Not even a little bit.
