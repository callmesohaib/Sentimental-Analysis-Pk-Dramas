[01:14] What is it?
Where are you?
[01:17] I was in the market, taking care of something. I just got free.
[01:22] I'm going back, what is the matter?
Can you please pick me up from the salon?
[01:33] Alright, where are you?
I'm in phase 5, I was waiting for the driver, but he's with Hadia.
[01:40] Alright fine. Send me the location and I'll be right there.
[01:46] Okay, perfect. I'm dropping you the location.
Okay bye*
[02:25] Where are you going? We'll drop you off.
What nonsense!?
[02:28] Have you no shame in harassing a girl like that?
We're not harassing you, we're just praising your beauty.
[02:34] Just shut up and get lost.
Don't get angry, we're on our way and we'll drop you off.
[02:47] Who are they?
[03:13] Are you insane? Who asked you to wait outside? You could have waited inside.
[03:19] Razi, I thought you were almost about to reach, that's why I came outside. Why did you...
[03:26] talk to them. You know how dangerous they can be, they are carrying guns sometimes. What if something had happened to you?
[03:35] Really, what if something would have happened to you?
[03:42] Since when have you been so worried about me?
It's not about worry, it's about responsibility.
[03:48] I have to take care of you and you're no less than Farwa to me.
[03:58] Shall I say something?
[04:01] What?
[04:05] Don't you have some appropriate clothes?
[04:09] Now, what's wrong with my clothes?
[04:14] Let it go... I was just saying...
No, tell me the type of clothes I should wear.
[04:29] I think...
[04:32] you'll look good in shalwar kameez.
Alright fine, you'll only find me in shalwar kameez from now on.
[04:39] Look, forget about what I said. It's your life...
[04:45] I'm not forcing you, only wear it if you want to...
No, I like your suggestion.
[04:51] Turn the car around and let's go to the mall.
[04:55] Right now?
Yes.
[05:00] Don't you want to go home?
I did want to go home, but now I want to go shopping with you.
[05:06] Right now?
[05:08] Yes, right now.
[05:14] I need to go somewhere far because of mother and I'm already late.
I will hear no excuses today. We're going to the mall today.
[05:21] We'll shop, have ice cream and then we'll go home.
Natasha, please.
[05:28] Razi, please! Turn the car around and let's go.
[05:36] Okay.
[05:39] Yay shopping!
[08:01] Ramsha...
[08:03] All good? Why did you call me so urgently here?
Why haven't you come home in two days?
[08:09] Ramsha, I just...
[08:12] Enough... no more excuses. You don't pick up any of my calls...
[08:17] You use meetings as an excuse to turn off my calls. What game are you playing with me?
[08:26] No game.
[08:29] Some problems are going on at work. I'm really busy at work and I need to win my father's trust. I need your support.
[08:37] Faizan, I was scared. Will someone compel you to leave me?
[08:43] Ramsha...
[08:47] No, I will never leave you.
[08:51] Soon, I will tell everyone about our relationship.
[08:56] When will that time come?
[08:58] Soon... just let me be financially independent.
[09:04] But that will never happen until Hadia is still present with you. Why don't you leave her when you don't like her?
[09:11] Why don't you remove her from your life?
It's not that easy, and now it has become even more difficult because...
[09:23] Because what?
[09:25] Nothing...
Because she is pregnant?
[09:32] How do you know?
[09:35] You didn't tell me, but I learned it on my own.
[09:39] And if you want to know how? Then look at this video.
[09:47] I saw Hadia outside the clinic today.
[09:51] And I understood that she was pregnant.
[09:55] And who is that man, who took Hadia for a check-up?
[10:00] I didn't know that you guys are so liberal that another man would take Hadia for a check-up.
[10:10] He's my cousin, Razi.
[10:12] How come your cousin is so informal with your wife? So much so that he's holding her hand and roaming around with her.
[10:22] There is nothing like that in that video.
There wasn't...
[10:26] But that's the truth. I saw it.
[10:33] This is no concern to you.
Don't be angry with me and ask Hadia why she was with Razi.
[10:43] You act like a lion in front of me...
Ramsha enough...
[10:47] Not a word, please!
Otherwise, what will you do? Will you leave me?
[10:53] Faizan, once and for all, why don't you leave me? I don't like spending such a life as well.
[11:00] I've grown tired of this. You told me that you had no interest in Hadia and that you will leave her.
[11:06] But now she's pregnant, now it's harder for you to leave her.
[11:12] Very convenient. How much longer should I tolerate this?
[11:17] What is going on? Why are you two fighting like kids?
[11:22] Mother, Hadia is pregnant and he didn't tell me that. He's taking care of his pregnant wife...
[11:29] and he's lying to me that he's at work.
[11:33] You were right about him. He's a liar, a fraud, and a coward.
[11:39] He left no stone unturned in trying to ruin my life.
[11:44] It's better that I die rather than live this life. I don't want to remain unwanted in someone's life.
[11:51] Ramsha, listen to me... Ramsha... Ramsha!
[11:57] What happened Ramsha! Get up Ramsha!
Ramsha*
[12:06] Ramsha, call them...
[12:37] Note this.
[12:54] Doctor, what happened to my daughter? Why did she faint?
[12:58] No need to worry, this happens in her state. I have good news, your daughter is about to become a mother.
[13:05] What? Thank you very much. Thank you, God!
[13:11] Such great news! Did you hear? Many congratulations!
[13:17] You're about to become a father and I a grandmother. Thank God!
[13:21] Why are you standing there? Bring sweetmeats. I'll go check in on her.
[13:58] Where did you go?
[14:02] Hospital for a check-up.
[14:06] With whom?
You don't take me, so obviously with the driver.
[14:11] Don't lie to me.
[14:15] I saw you and Razi coming out of the clinic together.
[14:20] That doesn't mean I went with him. I saw him outside when I came out of the clinic.
[14:26] Go and ask the driver if you don't believe me.
Enough Hadia!
[14:32] I don't need to ask anyone anything. I saw you two.
[14:42] I'm warning you one last time. Stay away from him!
[14:51] Stay away!
[15:19] I'll ask the driver to pick it up. Faizan...
[15:28] Where are you going?
[15:36] To my friend.
So late at night?
[15:40] Faizan, there are greater things in life than your friends.
[15:47] One has to be practical to move forward in life.
[15:51] Relationships are more important than friends, do you understand that?
[15:57] Relationships? Since when have you started talking like that? Did you make a deal with father?
[16:03] Faizan, don't talk nonsense.
[16:07] You know that your father has strictly asked me to keep an eye on you.
[16:12] And you're giving him a chance to do such things.
So, will you spy on me now?
[16:18] Faizan...
I'm tired of my father's strictness and his dictatorship.
[16:24] How can he restrict me from going to places and meeting people? I can't spend my life according to him.
[16:29] Your father only wants you to give Hadia time...
I've grown tired of hearing her name, so enough!
[16:38] I don't want to make anyone happy. Not Hadia, or father. It's my life, can't I spend it my way?
[17:21] You look very nice...
Really? I don't look weird, right?
[17:26] Not at all.
[17:27] The dress is so beautiful. Do you choose it, or was it, auntie?
This one is mine.
[17:35] Come and sit... mother was telling me that you weren't feeling well. What happened? All okay?
[17:41] Yes, my blood pressure rose, that's it.
That's good.
[17:48] I wanted to apologize to you... I wasn't with you in your hard time...
[17:57] If Faizan hadn't had an accident, I would have been here.
[18:02] Forget about it Hadia.
[18:05] I don't want to remember the time. It's good that I got rid of a liar like Sherry,
[18:13] I'm very happy now.
[18:18] That's good. Because all of us want to see you happy.
[18:22] Hadia, I wanted to apologize to you for everything that has happened.
[18:28] Mother and I didn't like you before, but now I want you to forget the past.
[18:35] So that we can become friends. Is that possible?
[18:39] Why not?
[19:11] Safdar... you haven't changed yet, don't you have to go to work?
[19:19] I'll go at my leisure.
[19:22] You've never been late to work, why the sudden change?
[19:27] When children handle their responsibilities, then parents can find the time to relax.
[19:34] Thank God. That means that you're happy with Faizan.
[19:39] Maybe... and this way you'll find some time for me as well.
[19:47] My time has always been for you.
No way. You've always given more time to your business.
[20:01] I know... you've done everything for us.
I want my children to become my support in my old age.
[20:09] And I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully.
[20:13] If God is willing.
I was very satisfied seeing Faizan at work today.
[20:24] I hope everything happens as I'm planning it to. Where is he? Send him to me.
[20:30] Of course. He left as soon as he had breakfast. He told me that he had to learn some things at work.
[20:36] The manager was praising him. He said that Faizan was very involved in work.
[20:43] My son had always been brilliant, but you always compared him with Razi. Now see, everyone else is praising him as well.
[20:54] One shouldn't be so content so soon. I don't want this to be a flash in the pan...
[21:02] Please, Safdar, don't say such things about Faizan...
[21:06] Not only him, but you also demotivate me as well.
Alright, I won't do that...
[21:13] Alright... I told you something, but you didn't respond.
[21:20] About what?
About Fizza.
[21:23] Because of Hadia, Fizza's studies might get disturbed. Studying medicine is very hard.
[21:31] You're saying that like she's the only one studying medicine.
Alright... ask Hadia... if she agrees...
[21:39] then call her.
Why would she object? It would give her time to spend time with her sister.
[21:45] Do what you think is right. I'll go freshen up and then I have to leave for work.
[21:52] Alright, in the meantime I'll have breakfast served.
[22:27] Faizan have something sweet. I've made mutton pulao as well for you, be sure to eat it before you leave.
[22:36] Forget it mother, he won't eat it.
[22:45] The news of my pregnancy has struck him like lightning. He has lost his appetite.
[22:52] It's nothing like that.
If that were true, then your voice wouldn't be so hesitant.
[22:59] And you wouldn't have left me at the hospital yesterday.
I needed to go home, why don't you understand that?
[23:06] I understand everything.
[23:10] You're not happy with my pregnancy, rather you're sad.
[23:18] No Ramsha, it's not like that.
Your face tells me of your heart.
[23:27] But if you think that I will get myself rid of this child, then you are mistaken.
[23:33] What's the matter with you? Why are you being angry for no reason? I admit I'm tense about it, but that doesn't mean I'm not happy about this.
[23:40] That's the complaint I have against you. If you had any confidence you would have taken me home.
[23:50] You would have accepted me as your wife in front of everyone. You would not have continued to meet me in hiding.
[24:00] Anyways, whatever fate chooses for me.
[24:04] The sad thing is that I love a cowardly man...
[24:12] Listen to one thing with open ears, I will not compromise when it comes to my child.
[24:20] I will not let anything unjust happen to it. The time has come for you to make a decision.
[24:29] Otherwise, I would not let you see my face or my child's face. Understand?
[24:40] Don't worry Faizan. Ramsha is very angry, that's why she said such things. I'll make her understand, everything will get better.
[24:50] How can I not worry? Have you seen her attitude? How can I not be tense? I haven't told them about my marriage, then how can I tell them about a child?
[24:58] Faizan, Ramsha loves you.
[25:04] She has sacrificed a lot for you. She bet her entire life on you.
[25:13] I just have a request...
[25:18] Be mindful of her emotions. Don't be unjust to her.
[25:26] Do you understand what I'm saying, right?
[25:55] Hadia...
Yes?
[25:57] What are you doing?
I'm setting my wardrobe.
[26:01] Why? The doctors have asked you not to do such things. Why are you doing this, when you have servants at home who can do this for you?
[26:08] I do ask them to do things for me, but what's wrong with doing something on my own? I get bored at home.
[26:15] That's not okay. I've arranged something for that. I've asked Safdar to bring your sister Fizza here.
[26:23] There is no need for that, she just went away. This will affect her studies.
[26:27] Fizza being here will distract you. She will take care of her diet. Besides this way, there will be someone here you will listen to.
[26:37] I've called her here. She'll be here any moment.
[26:50] You just went there last week. Why are you going now?
Her in-laws told me that she isn't taking care of herself, so I'll do that.
[27:00] Besides, I have to stay there for a few days, after that my parents will come. Then I'll go on a long holiday.
[27:05] You complete the notes, right?
Yes, I have.
[27:10] We're getting late for our classes.
Go ahead, I'll be right there. Farewell*
[27:25] You have no respect, you didn't even thank me.
For what?
[27:30] What do you mean? I helped you get out of that rush.
[27:34] Thank you...
I haven't completed what I said.
[27:39] Everyone is watching, let go of my hand.
Alright, I apologize.
[27:44] But, you weren't listening to me, that's why I held your hand.
I've warned you before...
[27:50] Stay away from me! I'm warning you one last time, if you come near me again, I'll complain about you to the principal.
[27:57] But I need to talk to you. Until I complete what I say, I will not go anywhere.
[28:03] Do whatever you want. Scream if you want, but I will not go until I say what's in my heart.
[28:12] I love you Fizza... and if I don't have you...
[28:17] then I will die. I will really die.
[28:22] I really love you.
Are you mad?
[28:25] Do you even care about your self-respect? If I tell the principal about this, he will expel you.
[28:32] Your career will be ruined, do you even care about that?
What have I done that he will expel me?
[28:40] I only expressed my love, what's wrong with that?
You're insane, don't ever come near me again.
[28:48] Just say yes... I'll send my parents to you and take you away respectfully.
[28:58] I'm warning you one last time, otherwise, I'll shout and gather everyone. Then you'll be humiliated.
[29:04] Don't come near me.
[29:26] You're back soon.
Yes, mother...
[29:30] There wasn't much to do at work, so I decided that I should spend time with my mother.
[29:36] That's very good. Otherwise, I don't see your face all day.
[29:43] I only see at night.
[29:47] What can I do? I have to take care of things at work.
[29:51] All of that is right... but I have a complaint. You don't think about yourself.
[30:00] You're there for that. How can I think for myself when you're here? 
[30:06] Really... what will you do, when I'm not here. Will you think alone?
Mother...
[30:12] God forbid something happens to you. I can't live without you.
[30:19] Then why don't you stop being stubborn?
[30:24] Forget about it. Freshen up, then we'll talk.
[30:31] Alright... I don't see Farwa. Where is she?
She's making something for you in the kitchen.
[30:38] Really... that's great. I'll go freshen up.
[30:41] Alright.
[30:52] Wow... that smells good. What are you making?
Pasta.
[30:58] Brother Razi likes it...
Really? What else does he like?
[31:06] I was just asking.
[31:12] Where's auntie? I haven't seen her in a while.
[31:18] And... why are you doing this? Let the house help do this.
[31:26] Yes, there is... but I like staying busy.
[31:30] Why? Have you stopped studying?
No, why would I do that? It's my final year, so I have a lot of free time.
[31:41] I use that time to make brother Razi's favorite dishes.
[31:51] I feel like cooking nowadays...
[31:55] I was thinking of learning it from you and Hadia. Would you mind that?
[32:01] Why not? That's great.
[32:05] Let's start today. What have you added to the pasta?
I've just boiled the pasta. Let me tell you the name of the spices first.
[32:13] Hand me the chilly...
This one?
[32:18] You've gone very weak.
[32:19] It's good that aunt Shina called me here. I will take care of you.
[32:24] I do take care of myself.
I can see that.
[32:28] Now that I'm here, I will take good care of you.
Auntie didn't do right by calling you here.
[32:35] Because of me, your studies will be disturbed. I know how tough your studies are and still, you had to come here for me.
[32:43] Sister, why are you worrying? I will cover my course.
[32:49] You know how intelligent I am.
[32:54] Sure... I know that. Shall I have lunch served for you?
[32:58] No... I just had lunch.
Go and rest. We'll have tea in the evening.
[33:05] Sure... where's brother, Faizan?
[33:10] He's at work.
Is he finally enjoying work?
[33:18] Go and lay down. You must be tired.
[33:25] After you guys left, he came to me and said all sorts of nonsense.
[33:30] He's gone insane. I don't know what to do.
[33:36] I was thinking of complaining to the principal. I forgot my notes there as well.
That won't do you any good. That will only defame you
[33:47] Your name will be joined with that man in the university. And he will go to any lengths to take revenge on you.
[33:54] Listen to me... take a few days off from work for a few days and stay away from him.
[34:01] He'll forget about you when he doesn't see you.
But that's not a solution.
[34:06] He knows his sister's address as well. He followed me here when Nisar dropped me off last time.
[34:15] I fear that he might say something to Nisar.
Why don't you tell Nisar about this?
[34:21] I think it's time for you to tell Nisar about that man.
[34:27] You're right, I should do that.
[34:33] I will do that...
[34:36] I'll talk to you later. Farewell.
[34:53] Forget this... and choose a girl from this...
[35:00] Look how pretty they are, choose one.
[35:05] Should I look at a picture and choose them?
When did I say that? This is only a start.
[35:11] You can meet them later on. Who's stopping you?
[35:15] If you say yes now, only then I can move things forward.
But I don't want to marry right now.
[35:22] Enough Razi! When will you marry Razi? What are you waiting for?
[35:29] Listen to me. I want to leave this place!
[35:34] Hurry up and marry. So that we may leave this place.
[35:38] I want to marry Farwa and you. Look at me...
[35:47] If you like some girl then tell me.
[35:51] You know there's no one.
Yes, I know that, that's why I'm looking at girls for you.
[35:58] Listen to me... if you choose someone, it will make it easier for me.
[36:05] I want to marry you before Farwa.
[36:11] Mother... don't worry about me. Think about Farwa first.
[36:17] No... first you will marry, then it will be Farwa.
[36:30] Natasha my dear...
Auntie...
[36:35] I brought pasta...
Did you make it?
[36:39] No Farwa made it... but she asked me to bring it for Razi.
[36:43] That's why I brought it here.
Yes, he does like pasta a lot.
[36:48] I'll get going...
Sit down...
[36:51] No auntie. I was doing something.
[36:58] Here, eat this pasta.
[37:03] Leave it be and get up.
[37:07] Come on...
I'm not hungry. I'll eat it later.
[37:14] My God... my words do not affect him.
[37:21] Why are you always listening to something? Try listening to me for a change.
[37:26] Ramsha, you need to compel him to take you home with him.
[37:33] After all, you're his wife. He needs to accept you in front of everyone.
I did say that in front of you...
[37:46] If Hadia leave his life, then my life would be settled.
[37:52] What I don't understand is now that her affair with his cousin is exposed to him...
[38:01] then why doesn't he leave her?
It's not that easy. Hadia has Safdar Kamal's support.
[38:10] If I had that support, then I would have been in a strong position as well.
[38:16] But Faizi's father will never favor me.
[38:20] Yes, but if Hadia leaves Faizi, then that's something else entirely.
[38:27] She will.
[38:30] If Hadia's parents...
[38:34] learn about you...
