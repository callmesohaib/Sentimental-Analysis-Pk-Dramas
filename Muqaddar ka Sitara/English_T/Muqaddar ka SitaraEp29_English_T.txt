[01:05] Khadijah? Khadijah?
Yes?
[01:13] Come here. Is the food ready?
[01:18] Yes, almost. Some work is still left. Call and ask them when will they reach?
[01:24] I think they'll come till evening. I talked to Fizza, she said she was ready in her hostel.
[01:33] She's waiting for Faizan and Hadia.
Then I'll be done until then.
[01:38] Yes. As God wills. See what I brought.
[01:43] Show me. 
Hadia is coming with her husband for the first time.
[01:54] What is this?
I thought it would look bad if we send her back empty handed.
[02:00] Its good you did. I had forgotten. It skipped my mind.
[02:07] Now pray to God that Faizan likes what we brought. You know he has a different choice.
[02:18] Don't worry. I talked to Hadia and I was satisfied after I talked to her.
[02:27] She was very happy. She said Faizan has changed a lot and he's taking care of her. I hope he shows us some respect as well.
[02:40] I pray to God it does. I hope it is as you say.
[02:53] Look at the food. What if it burns?
[03:17] Wow Faizan, you look so handsome in this.
Really? Handsome? I'm very uncomfortable, I think I should change.
[03:26] No Faizan please. Please wear it today for me. Don't wear it ever again.
[03:32] Mom will make fun of me, if she sees me.
She isn't even home. I saw her leaving just now.
[03:39] Then nothing can be done. Alright. Lets go.
Okay.
[03:50] You will not leave so quickly. You've come to your in laws for the first time, you'll have to spend the entire day.
I'd say you should stay for the night.
[04:00] I'll take you on a tour of Safdar's land and I'll take you to the school as well.
Next time. Not this time. But Hadia will stay for a few days. In fact as long as she likes.
[04:15] Its fine then. You should stay with her then.
Oh, I just remembered. I heard you joined your university.
[04:24] Yes uncle. I think I need to have an MBA to look after the business.
That's fine dear but you could work alongside studies as well.
[04:36] There's no exchange for experience and its better than these wads of papers.
[04:44] You're absolutely right but I have problems when it comes to multitasking.
[04:50] I was thinking to join a course in the evening. I have assignments and group studies so I'll be busy.
You're right.
[04:59] By the way dear, we're happy to see this change of attitude in you.
[05:07] In fact Hadia was praising you a lot. May God bless you both with happiness.
Amen.
[05:20] Faizan please try these kebabs. Mom's kebabs are famous in the entire Hyderabad.
No. I'm quite full. I cannot eat anymore.
[05:30] You'll have to eat some. Mom made these for you.
No. Please thank you.
[05:37] Its all for you. Please take these kebabs.
I'm seriously full.
[05:44] If you want, should I make tea?
I think nobody makes tea better than Hadia so she should be making it.
[05:51] This is true. Hadia has come after such a long time and I want to taste the tea she makes.
[06:00] Until then, I'll sit and talk with Faizan.
[06:17] Isn't it amazing? How did Faizan agree to come with you?
I didn't even ask him. He wanted to surprise.
[06:28] Really? This means you've controlled him good. Isn't it?
Its not that.
[06:38] Tell me the truth. What did you do that you changed him overnight? I don't believe he's the same Faizan who wouldn't even talk to us.
[06:48] He's talking to all of us. In fact he has turned very romantic as well. I saw him stealing glances at you.
[06:57] He got admission in MBA as well. This seems like a miracle.
Didn't I tell you he had changed? He even took me on a long driver yesterday.
[07:08] We had dinner and then we went shopping as well.
Wow. I'm so happy for you. May God always keep you this happy and may Faizan stay like this forever.
[07:23] Amen.
Girls whats the delay? You know your dad has to go for prayers as well.
[07:31] Mom we're just bringing it.
Okay. Good. Hurry up.
[07:36] Yes mom.
[07:53] Dear tell me how is Safdar?
He's fine. I mean what would happen to him. He's perfect.
[08:02] Actually I heard he was upset about Natasha.
Everybody is upset about her. She ruined our family's respect. She shouldn't have done this.
[08:18] That's alright dear. Natasha might have done this because she was being emotional.
[08:27] But Safdar should be patient. If he cuts her off, she'll lose all hope.
[08:37] Uncle, he wouldn't understand this. He has always been strict with us. But whatever Natasha did isn't good either.
[08:51] I'm sure dad would have married her off somewhere good. She did wrong.
[09:03] I don't think he'll come today.
He'll definitely come. He promised me and he always keeps his promise.
[09:14] He also promised you that he'd marry you and nobody else. But now he's happily married and at his in laws. He doesn't bother about you.
Please mom..
[09:27] I'm already very disturbed, don't add onto it.
Ramsha my dear.. You're my daughter, my life.
[09:37] I'm your mother and its my duty to make you understand. I tell you eveyrthing because I'm worried about you. I'm worried Faizan will cheat on you.
[09:49] He will not deceive me. I trust him.
I hope it is so. Now call him and find out what he's up to at his in law's house.
[10:07] Dear answer your phone, its been ringing.
Its my friend's call. He's worried about our assignment. I'll talk to him when I get to Karachi.
[10:21] Okay dear.
[10:30] Have your tea dear.
Yes. I'll just put it on silent. It'll disturb us.
[10:46] Hey. I'm sorry, I'm late.
You coming late isn't something new Faizan. I'm now used to waiting for you.
[10:59] But let it be. Tell me how was your visit with your in laws?
[11:10] It was pathetic actually.
Really? Why?
[11:15] They're very pushy people. I'm not hungry and yet they insist me to eat and pile stuff on my plate.
[11:23] I got rid of them with a lot of difficulty. If they could, they would feed me themselves. I mean I didn't like it.
[11:41] Who is calling?
Hadia.
[11:46] Why is she calling you at this hour?
I don't know.
[11:51] Faizan don't answer it. Its my time with you and I'll not accept that you sit with me and talk to Hadia.
[12:09] Let me talk. Don't know why she's calling?
I'm warning you. Don't you pick up the call.
[12:16] If I don't answer, she'll disturb and call again and again. She might even call dad. He doesn't even know where I am.
[12:22] Faizan don't pick...
Let me talk to her Ramsha. What's wrong?
[12:25] Alright but put it on speaker.
Okay.
[12:32] Yes, what is it?
Hello. Are you home?
[12:35] Its been long.
But you didn't tell me.
[12:39] Is it important to tell you?
[12:42] You could have messaged me that you had reached Karachi safely. I was worried for you.
I'll tell you next time.
[12:51] Tell me what are you doing?
I'm missing you, very much.
[12:56] But you didn't even bother asking about me.
I just dropped you. You're at your parents' house. I didn't want to disturb you.
[13:04] Have fun. Stay as much as you like. I won't bother you.
I'll not stay for long. I'll be back in a day or two.
[13:12] Why?
Because you're not with me. I miss you very much. Don't you miss me?
[13:21] Hadia..
I cannot live with you now.
[13:29] People are right. Marriage is very powerful. It makes two strangers come close together.
[13:40] I didn't realize I would love you so much. Why aren't you saying something? Faizan?
[13:52] Hello? Faizan?
[14:26] Fine. I'll look into it. I'll be late.
Tea.
[14:35] Thank you.
You didn't go to office today?
[14:41] I'll be late for a few days.
[14:47] Uncle has given me the responsibility to spy on Faizan. He says I should keep an eye on him before I go to work.
Wow. Interesting. You should go then.
[15:01] I'm his nephew not a slave. If he wants someone to spy on his son, he should get a detective. Why me?
[15:11] Very bad. When uncle has given you a task, you should listen to him.
I'll lie to him and tell him he goes to his university.
[15:21] Will you lie?
Hmm..
[15:28] Farva I'm helpless. Even though I know Faizan fakes excuses for university and instead hangs out with his friends but its his personal life. Why should I bother?
[15:40] I don't want to interfere.
But you'll make uncle upset. Why are you doing this?
[15:47] See Farva, its best if he stays away from work. He doesn't work. He has also tricked uncle and took away millions from the hotel account along with the manager.
[16:03] I cannot bear it. I'm answerable to uncle.
Why don't you tell uncle?
[16:11] Its no use. He has the manager on his side. Both of them are taking away millions. I don't understand.
[16:23] He makes me realize this again and again that he is the owner's son and I'm an employee.
Whatever it is,
[16:33] it is true.
I'm an honest man and I work with all my self respect. I cannot tolerate all this.
[16:55] Right now I'm just happy that Faizan isn't coming to office. I'm working peacefully having gotten rid of him.
[17:08] Right now I'm just happy that Faizan isn't coming to office. I'm working peacefully having gotten rid of him.
Right now I'm just happy that Faizan isn't coming to office. I'm working peacefully having gotten rid of him.
[17:10] Right now I'm just happy that Faizan isn't coming to office. I'm working peacefully having gotten rid of him.
[17:51] Mom I don't want to live in this country. I'm a US citizen and I want to go back to the US.
I'm warning you if you do anything that turns your father against you.
[18:04] It would be best if you stay quiet for a few days. I'll then talk to your dad and then bring you back. You know your dad will not be upset with you for long.
[18:32] Lets go back to your dad and apologize to him. You're his daughter. He cannot just cut you off.
[18:44] Sherry please. I don't want to go anywhere especially with you.
See I'm your husband.
[18:55] Oh please just shut up.
See I know I made a mistake but this doesn't mean you insult me every time.
[19:09] I accept that I deceived you and hid things from you but I just wanted,
[19:19] you to leave everything and marry me. I really love you. I will never leave you.
Sherry please be quiet. I don't want to see your face or talk to you. Leave.
[19:37] Do you know I'm living here because I'm helpless. I don't like living with you here. If you don't leave, I will.
[20:01] Hello? Faryal? You told me that your uncle was a family lawyer? Please take me to him. I need to meet him urgently.
[20:14] I need to discuss two problems actually. I need to divorce Sherry and secondly dad has cut me off from his inheritance but I'm his daughter.
[20:28] I need to send him a notice about cutting me off. Okay fine. See you. Bye.
[21:44] Razi you got late in coming back.
Yes mom. I had some work in the office.
[21:54] Do you want to have dinner? Should I get you some food?
No mom. I'm not hungry.
[22:02] Hmm. Did you find anything about Natasha. Any news about her?
[22:13] Yes mom. There's a boy named Sherry. He is a cheater. I've requested uncle to think about it.
[22:24] Its up to him if he calls Natasha back or not.
I think Safdar should forgive Natasha. She's his daughter. How long can he be upset with her?
[22:38] I said the same thing mom. I even told uncle the same thing. But its his personal matter. He'll do as he finds best.
Yes dear.
[22:53] It is Safdar's right to decide whatever he wants but as a father he shouldn't be emotional but rather be sensible in deciding for his children.
[23:15] Mom the thing is, uncle has decided to cut off Natasha from his wealth.
What?
[23:26] What is wrong with Safdar? His haste always makes him regret things later.
[23:36] You're right.
Oh well. You should go and freshen up.
[23:45] Do you want tea? I'll get some for you.
No mom. Later.
[23:50] This boy...
[24:02] How long will you not bother about your daughter? Even people are asking me about her. The society is talking about her.
Haven't you realized it very soon?
[24:18] Do you even realize what a father feels when people question him about his daughter leaving the house?
[24:27] Aleem called the other day. When he told me to forgive her, I was so embarrassed. I felt as if I'd never be able to face him ever again.
[24:42] Leave everyone. Think about your daughter. She wants to come back home. She's missing all of us and insists she wants to come home.
[24:57] For God's sake Safdar, forgive her.
Nothing is wrong with her. She's just emotionally blackmailing you. Why do you listen to her?
[25:07] I'm her mother. I'm not being emotionally blackmailed by her. I'm not so insensitive that I don't care about my own children.
Enough Sheena. Stop supporting your good for nothing children all the time.
[25:22] Be quiet. If Natasha comes here, Sherry will follow her and I will not tolerate that useless boy in my house.
When did she say she wants him to come along? She wants to divorce him and get rid of him. I told you she was never interested in him.
[25:42] What? What are you saying? Natasha wants to get rid of him? Leave him? But she married him willingly.
[25:59] Marriage is not a child's play that she can get married today and leave him tomorrow. She's mistaken.
[26:06] If she things I'll let Sherry stay at my house, she's mistaken. I can cut off my children but I'll never take such a serious step. Do you hear me?
[26:20] But I'll not let my daughter rot in that hell. That boy is not worth Natasha at any cost. He doesn't work and is keeping her in that hole.
However he is,
[26:34] she liked him. She married him so she should stay with him and not think about coming here. You're not meeting her again.
I will.
[26:44] I will meet her a thousand times. I'm not stone hearted like you that after knowing my daughter had an accident,
[26:53] It was a small accident. You only told me she was fine and discharged from the hospital.
But still Safdar,
[27:02] you didn't even call her. She felt that. she was very emotional, upset and hurt.
She has no right to be upset with me.
[27:13] I will not forgive her unless she accepts her mistake.
She realized her mistake a long time ago. She's embarrassed.
[27:27] She wants to come back home Safdar but please you need to forgive her.
[27:57] You haven't slept?
[28:02] I don't know Fizza I'm just not sleepy.
[28:07] Oh, so you're missing Faizan. 
Probably.
[28:14] Hmm. I'm sure. He's made you sleepless.
Yes.
[28:25] What is wrong with me? I don't understand. I'm so restless without him.
Oh wow.
[28:33] You love him so much.
He also loves me too. He takes care of me now.
[28:42] Its a good thing but sometimes I doubt how he changed all of a sudden?
Yes even I don't know how he changed so fast.
[28:55] But I think marriage is as such that it makes two people fall in love.
I just hope to God that, Faizan takes care of you like this all your life.
[29:07] May he care for this relationship like this. Forever.
Amen.
[29:17] Come on its late. Lets go to sleep.
[29:38] She realized her mistake and she's very embarrassed. She wants to come home Safdar but please you forgive her now.
[30:13] I've kept everything, mom.
Why are you going? I didn't even realize. Three days went by so soon.
[30:20] I have had not my fill yet.
Thats true mom. Even I don't feel like going but if I don't go I will not get offs again and my studies will suffer as well.
[30:33] I understand but I'll be upset.
Why mom? Why will you be upset? Enjoy with your other daughter.
[30:45] I'm coming to Karachi with you as well.
Why?
[30:50] Why are you going?
Mom, I want to surprise Faizan.
[30:57] I will be all alone then.
[30:59] Faizan said you could stay for as long as you liked.
Mom, let her go.
[31:05] She's missing Faizan a lot and as it is she loves Faizan more than you. Let her go.
[31:11] You be quiet. You always turn mom against me.
Then stay with mom.
[31:18] Why are you going?
I have to go one day and if I go with you, I won't even feel.
[31:24] Mom and dad would be at peace that we went together.
[31:30] Alright. Both of you go together.
[31:35] But stay for a while. Meet your dad before you leave. He went to the market. He'll be here soon.
Alright.
[31:44] I'll keep these bags on a side.
Did you keep everything?
[31:48] Yes.
[31:58] When are you visiting the lawyer?
[32:02] How do you know?
I'm sorry but,
[32:07] I heard you and Faryal talking.
Its none of your business. Stop spying on me.
[32:15] I am not interfering in your matters. I'm only advising you.
[32:22] I don't need your advises.
I know you don't need my advises but I'll still support you.
[32:32] Because I love you.
[32:37] Natasha this court is a mess.
[32:42] Where will you get money to find a good lawyer?
I'll take it from mom and I've already hired a lawyer.
[32:50] Dad must have received the notice by now.
You'll upset him even more and lose your share of the wealth.
[33:03] Come with me. Both of us will go see your dad and apologize to him.
[33:09] He's your father. He'll not be upset with you for long.
If he's stubborn then I'm also his daughter.
[33:17] What will he be upset about? Now I'm upset with him.
[33:23] I've sent him such a notice. He'll never forget.
[33:47] Dad's calling.
Pick it up and talk to him.
[33:55] Hello?
Hello dear. How are you?
[33:59] So you miss me now? It seems you've received the notice my lawyer sent.
[34:05] May be you're scared thats why you're calling me that I'll take my share and leave this country.
What?
[34:14] Lawyer? Notice? What are you saying?
[34:19] If you can cut me off because you were angry then I'm your daughter as well.
[34:24] For your kind information. Nobody, not even you or anybody else in the world can stop me from taking whats mine. You'll get a notice from my lawyer in a day or two.
[34:36] I don't want to have any contact with a selfish father like you. Natasha is dead for you.
[35:00] I was thinking to forgive her and she wants to go in the court against me. No.
[35:11] I will not forgive her or her useless husband at any cost. She doesn't deserve and apology.
[35:22] Even after falling down so many times she has not realized anything.
[35:41] Hello.
Hello. Where were you? You spent so many days in Hyderabad.
[35:47] I just went for three days.
I missed you so much. The hostel seemed barren without you. Lets go to the canteen. I haven't eaten anything.
[35:56] I think we have 10 minutes for class. We can take the class and then go to the canteen.
I'm very hungry.
[36:03] Oh God. She's so hungry. I think you should not study medicine and instead open a restaurant.
[36:11] I think someone was waiting for you restlessly.
[36:15] Who?
That lover that you have. He had been waiting for you. He looks so happy now that you're here.
[36:28] Be quiet. What are you saying?
I think he really likes you otherwise the college is filled with beautiful girls.
[36:35] He doesn't even look at anyone. He really loves you.
[36:39] You're supporting this cheap boy in front of me. You do know I'm engaged.
[36:44] Don't talk about his love in front of me. I want to complain about him to the admin but I'm usually quiet because of my respect.
[36:52] Leave him. Don't complain about him and destroy his career. You have no idea about the punishment for harassment here.
[37:00] But he doesn't even bother about my respect, why should I then?
He tried asking me about you. Like where you lived and what your father did.
[37:08] Why?
What do you mean why? Don't you know he loves you? He wants to send over a proposal.
[37:16] How dare he? He knows I'm engaged and yet he's asking such questions.
I tried to tell him to stop thinking about you.
[37:25] But he's very stubborn. He loves you very much. I think you should talk to him. May be he'll understand if you tell him.
[37:36] I'm going. I have a class. I'll see you.
[37:50] Hello.
Hello. You're back so soon.
[37:57] Girls forget to return when they visit their parents and you're back in a few days.
Yes. I didn't feel like staying anymore.
[38:07] You could have told me you were coming back. I would have sent a car. You're our daughter in law after all.
[38:13] I didn't come alone. I came with Fizza. She went to the hostel and I came home. I, actually,
[38:19] wanted to surprise Faizan thats why I came without informing.
Surprise?
[38:27] Interesting. Oh well, the guy you want to surprise isn't home.
[38:33] Where is he?
He didn't tell me.
[38:37] No problem. I'll wait for him.
[38:43] Surprise. Faizan has her under his influence good.
[38:52] Such girls stay stupid all their lives.
