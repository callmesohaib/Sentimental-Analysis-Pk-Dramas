[01:09] This is what brother said?
[01:11] Yes darling! I've never seen my son so much stressed and guilty before!
[01:19] Now the relation has changed!
[01:21] Still Faizan feels jealous of Raazi?
[01:23] Yes darling! Raazi wants to leave this country, just because of Faizan!
[01:29] He wishes to leave them and get away!
[01:32] He doesn't want to meet them!
[01:35] Mother listen! If this is what brother wants.
[01:38] Then let him leave.
[01:40] But you are also here darling! How can I?
[01:44] Mother! Hamza is here for me.
[01:47] I'm really happy with him! You should not worry about me.
[01:51] For now! You should think about Raazi!
[01:54] It'll be a big problem if anything else happens later.
[01:58] Sure! Faizan is just there to complain about everything!
[02:03] He is always up to something negative.
[02:05] Yes! I think Faizan is silent because he is already up to something.
[02:11] Before anything goes south.
[02:15] You guys should leave the house!
[02:18] You guys should shift somewhere else in your own house.
[02:21] I'll talk to Safdar.
[02:23] If possible
[02:25] We might leave this house before marriage.
[02:30] Sure!
[02:34] Whatever! Leave everything and tell me about your health. How are you?
[02:40] I'm fine! Thank god. I'm totally fine. Don't you worry about me!
[03:39] For whom did you buy this 1.2 million jewelery set ?
[03:50] I've told you so many times to not interfere in my stuff. Don't you understand?
[03:54] Answer me! Who do you gift these expensive things ?
[03:58] You should just know that it was not for you.
[04:02] I'm not bound to answer you for everything Hadia!
[04:05] You are bound! I'm your wife! You should answer me.
[04:14] I'll tell everyone now about the things you are up to. Including your father!
[04:20] Hadia don't make me mad! You are not in the situation to argue with me.
[04:26] Will you hurt me?
[04:28] You are hurting yourself.
[04:30] Every other day, you are sick! Sometimes your blood pressure is high, sometimes it's low.
[04:34] Can you not live in peace?
[04:36] Stay peaceful in this condition, and let me live in peace too.
[04:39] When you know that there is someone and I gift her things, why are you questioning?
[04:44] Do I ask you questions about Raazi?
[05:00] May I work now?
[05:07] Work!
[05:43] What happened? Your kids didn't join us in the breakfast.
[05:48] I don't know! Natasha slept late at night. Faizan is getting ready I guess!
[06:04] Hadia! What's with you? Didn't you sleep? You look so tired.
[06:14] Is everything OK?
[06:18] Yes! I'm fine but I want to talk to you about something.
[06:22] About what darling?
[06:24] Faizan is involved with another girl.
[06:34] He talks to her every night! He even meets her now. Every other day!
[06:40] He even gifts her things worth millions!
[06:47] Don't lie so much. Hadia!
[06:50] What is wrong with you? How can Faizan afford such things? Safdar doesn't give him that much money.
[06:58] Why will Hadia lie?
[07:01] Father! I saw the receipt myself!
[07:06] Really? Then show me the receipt!
[07:10] Faizan has it!
[07:14] Can't you see her? There's no receipt but still she'll lie!
[07:19] Faizan doesn't have this much amount.
[07:21] You know this well that your son knows the amount, and you know about it too.
[07:28] Don't prove Hadia wrong! Call your son! Call him!
[07:33] Hello!
[07:35] What am I listening?
[07:39] What?
[07:40] You gifted someone an expensive gift?
[07:47] Me?
[07:48] Don't try to act strange Faizan!
[07:53] Tell me the truth about the thing I asked! Hadia is true!
[08:03] Who is she? Since when are you with her? Why did you gift her so expensive jewelery?
[08:14] Why do you suspect me so much Hadia? You have insulted me in front of mother and father.
[08:21] Talk to me! Don't ask her.
[08:28] For whom did you buy that jewelery set ? Answer me!
[08:40] I bought it for Hadia!
[08:47] He is lying! He didn't give it to me.
[08:51] I didn't give it because it's an anniversary gift!
[08:54] It was supposed to be a surprise! but you...
[08:57] Father! He agreed to me that he bought this set for that girl! He didn't want me to interfere in his matter and he told me that he'll not leave that girl.
[09:06] Father!
[09:07] Wait a min! Let me decide. If you really bought that set for her then bring it!
[10:06] Father!
[10:15] Hadia! Can't you see. Faizan has decided to hand you over the house, the car and bought this expensive gift for you. You still just want to humiliate him?
[10:34] You know well that if this set was for someone else, then Faizan wouldn't have it still.
[10:40] Hadia would've misunderstood! Please! Stop it.
[10:51] You can keep it now! I don't want to spend anniversary with you now!
[11:22] Hadia! Faizan is trying to change so help him with it.
[11:30] Help him daughter.
[11:33] Try to ignore his little mistakes! It'll be great for you both.
[11:41] Don't feel sad. Just apologize to him when he comes back.
[12:49] What is really the truth?
[12:53] Has that girl returned to Faizan's life again?
[13:02] No!
[13:05] This cannot happen.
[13:23] Did I play well?
[13:28] First of all! Try to knock before entering my room!
[13:38] Really?
[13:42] I'm the son of owner! Future CEO and I can do anything at anytime I want to.
[14:03] You might be the future CEO! But till then, I have the authority right now.
[14:12] You cannot enter my room without my permission! Get out.
[14:20] I'll break your ego Raazi like this!
[14:23] Just like I broke Hadia's ego.
[14:27] I can see everything!
[14:38] She might be dumb but she isn't cheap! You stole your own wife's necklace!
[14:46] Mind your language Raazi! Don't disrespect me.
[14:48] What is happening?
[14:52] Father! can't you see? He is trying to hurt me.
[14:58] He was threatening me that he'll kick me out of the office! You are hurting me Raazi.
[15:04] He is denying his mistake and trying to hide it.
[15:07] Father! He even said that he'll make me look bad. What is his problem with me?
[15:13] I'm telling you that he is lying! He was talking about Hadia!
[15:17] Father you can see what happened before when she blamed me! I am totally innocent! They all are trying to insult me! he has became so ignorant.
[15:34] Faizan!
[15:36] I'm warning you the last time! Silence.
[15:40] He is threatening me in front of you! You should think about what he does with me on your back.
[15:44] Faizan!
[15:45] Enough! don't even say a word.
[15:48] If you think he has some suspicious activities, you should have told me directly.
[15:53] Don't create a drama in this office so openly! We should appreciate him that he is trying to build himself now. He is changing from the old Faizan.
[16:07] He is coming on time and learning more! You should appreciate him! You are disgracing him.
[16:13] Raazi!
[16:15] Now! You have to relations with him! Don't forget that.
[16:21] You have disappointed me!
[16:37] As I said! That I'm the son of companies owner. The future CEO!
[16:48] So whenever you talk to me about anything. Think before talking. Be careful.
[16:59] You can sit now! You are allowed to.
[17:07] Sit down!
[18:14] Hello!
[18:15] Faizan! Where are you?
[18:16] I'm in the office.
[18:18] Saliq is calling you! Come quick.
[18:21] Why?
[18:22] You won't believe it!
[18:27] I'll believe anything today! What happened?
[18:31] Your factory got sold!
[18:35] What?
[18:36] I told you that you won't believe me.
[18:39] Now you are a big guy! Celebrate a little and quickly come here.
[18:44] Unbelievable! What was the deal?
[18:46] Leave the deal and stuff about it right now! Saliq is calling you, so quickly reach the place.
[18:55] You have to sign the papers.
[18:58] Oh god! I cannot come right now! Father is here with me in the office.
[19:03] You can make an excuse! You can tell him that you are going to visit a site. How can you miss such a happy moment Faizan?
[19:10] You are right! Wait, and let me try. I'll tell you about it.
[19:13] I have sent you the location! Quickly reach it!
[19:24] What a day! What a day.
[19:54] Congratulations!
[19:56] To you too!
[19:57] It would have been so great if you had bought this factory yourself and it would have later profited you and me.
[20:05] Yeah you are right! I'm sorry you are selling this factory for so less but my business depends on cash. I would have bought this factory for 800 million!
[20:17] The property would not have profited me that much.
[20:22] If you still feel that you have accepted a deal in loss
[20:29] You still have time.
[20:31] You can still cancel the deal.
[20:33] I have no objections.
[20:35] No! Not at all! That's not what I meant. I'm comfortable with the deal.
[20:39] That's great! You have to wait for your profit till next month.
[20:49] It feels great working with you.
[20:52] Same here!
[20:54] Wow! Big guys are having big deals. Nobody is asking this poor guy at all. A lunch will be great.
[21:02] We can arrange a party for later.
[21:05] This is what I'm talking about ! party.
[21:09] We can arrange a family party! You can bring your misses.
[21:15] Of course!
[21:17] Which one? Actually Faizan has two!
[21:23] Now this only depends on Faizan! Either he'll come with both or just with one.
[21:31] Yeah!
[22:25] So what have you thought?
[22:28] Who will you bring to the party? I mean which wife will you bring?
[22:34] I don't know! Hadia doesn't like such things and you know the situation already.
[22:40] If I take Rimsha! It's a big risk! I haven't told anyone about our marriage.
[22:46] Well said! I think you should bring Hadia.
[22:53] Keep Rimsha away from me after that farmhouse incident! As you know
[22:58] As you know! These high class parties don't happen everyday. It'll be a big opportunity for you to interact with high class people. He invites the elite class.
[23:11] But Hadia!
[23:12] Leave it Faizan! It's only for your own good. ask why?
[23:21] How?
[23:22] Hadia is respectful and educated. If you bring her to the party, Saliq and guests will be very happy to see her.
[23:34] There's respect for such girls in our society! You understand, Right?
[23:44] I'll try.
[23:45] Yeah!
[23:47] I'm sure that she won't deny!
[23:56] Raazi! I'm tired of these everyday talks.
[24:00] You know that Faizan is trying to disgrace you! You should be careful!
[24:06] After some days, we'll leave this house respectfully! Try to ignore him.
[24:16] I've got myself into an annoying problem after getting engaged with Natasha. I don't want any more help from uncle.
[24:27] Mother! You know well that I don't love Natasha!
[24:36] She asks me to love her.
[24:45] She is your future wife! She'll do it. If it was someone else. It would've been the same way.
[24:54] It would be better if you can forget that first love of yours.
[25:01] You don't want to forget her.
[25:04] And you know well that she can't become yours anymore!
[25:10] Who?
[25:13] Who are you talking about?
[25:17] No! Safdar! It's nothing like that.
[25:21] I listened about it from my ears.
[25:26] How can you let it go?
[25:28] Raazi! If there's some other girl in your life! tell me about it now. So we can decide on this moment
[25:36] Safdar! It's nothing like that! It's was an old affair of his in school days.
[25:43] He didn't even tell her ever!
[25:46] She has already got married somewhere else!
[25:49] He'll forget her later! He just liked her so much.
[25:53] He'll forget when he gets married to Natasha!
[25:58] Sister! My daughter is not that cheap.
[26:02] If he cannot decide! let's end the engagement now.
[26:07] It's true that I don't love Natasha! It's also true that I am marrying her on your order.
[26:21] You are my elder.
[26:25] As you wish!
[26:27] I promise you that after marriage I'll always keep Natasha happy just like a good husband does.
[26:36] Fine Raazi! I can agree with your saying.
[26:39] But I still want to give you a chance!
[26:42] You can still step back because after this marriage, I won't like to break Natasha heart.
[26:52] And the reason is that girl of yours! she might..
[26:55] No Safdar! She cannot comeback in his life. She is married.
[27:00] I have always agreed with your orders.
[27:05] I have always been honest with you.
[27:10] If you still suspect! You can get me married the next month.
[27:17] Even my own house is ready!
[27:20] A lot of people disagree with that.
[27:22] Safdar I agree with it.
[27:26] Sure! As you like!
[27:37] Tell me the truth! What was that 1.2 million jewelery for? Who did you give it too?
[27:44] I'm very tired right now! Can we talk about this later?
[27:46] No! Faizan I'm serious about it! tell me the truth. Who did you buy the necklace for?
[27:56] To a friend!
[27:59] Such an expensive gift? Are you mad? Hadia scolded you right!
[28:06] You better leave such acts! When you already have a wife.
[28:09] Which wife? Is she even that capable to be called as a wife! What's the matter with having a girlfriend?
[28:17] Still Faizan! You cannot gift her such expensive things.
[28:23] If your father has filled your account with such a big amount, it doesn't mean that you can start spending it so foolishly. You know that he can take it back.
[28:32] OK! I'll be careful.
[28:36] What about the necklace you gave to your wife Hadia?
[28:41] It's still yours! She won't keep it. She has a big ego. I'll return it.
[28:51] Let's go!
[29:05] Father! You are already here.
[29:09] Yes darling! I came early! Are you going somewhere?
[29:12] Yes! I actually ordered some clothes for my wedding!
[29:15] The boutique just called and told me to pick my order.
[29:20] That's good for you darling! Call your mother. I want to talk to her about something important.
[29:27] Is it a surprise father?
[29:30] Something like that. I want to talk about it in front of your mother.
[29:38] Wow! They are also here now. Come Sheena, sit ! I have to talk about something important.
[29:44] Important talk? About what?
[29:50] About what father? Tell us.
[29:53] Sure! It's about my daughter Natasha.
[30:01] Tell us quickly Safdar!
[30:04] Actually I have decided to get Natasha married next month now.
[30:14] That's so urgent! Did your sister ask you?
[30:17] No! Not at all.
[30:18] Raazi talked to me directly!
[30:24] I don't know why Raazi is in rush?
[30:27] He's getting a factory. This is why he is in rush. He would want to get married tomorrow.
[30:35] No my child, it isn't like this. I have already told you that he isn't a greedy person
[30:42] He's a good person
[30:47] Its an important call. I'm coming. Greetings! Yes, I was waiting for your call
[30:59] Don't do it. I'm telling you that you'd regret. Also, Raazi doesn't suit you. Why are you doing this?
[31:10] I know it very well what suits me or not
[31:16] If I was wrong, father wouldn't have supported me. He likes Raazi more than me
[31:23] father likes him because he doesn't know his reality.
[31:27] He and you both would regret the day he'd find out
[31:31] Faizan, Raazi isn't greedy at all otherwise he could take anything from father
[31:38] I do agree that he isn't greedy but he is a fraud. He's a cheater
[31:43] Hadia on one side, and you on the other. 
[31:50] Just shut up Faizan. Aren't you ashamed of putting such a disgusting blame on your wife?
[31:58] I'm saying what is true. Trust me, you'll regret and cry. Why don't you explain it to her?
[32:05] I explained her many times. I did. She first chose Sherry and now Raazi
[32:13] Sherry was my mistake, but do not compare Raazi with him. He isn't like him
[32:22] He belongs to a middle class background after all
[32:24] Father also used to live in a small town in Hyderabad. Why did you marry him then?
[32:36] Mother, I'm telling you this last time. Ask Faizan that I won't hear any word against Raazi
[32:44] He has gone blind in Raazi's hatred that he is blaming his simple wife
[32:52] Fine! Listen, he is getting married to you only because I got married to Hadia. He is taking revenge. He doesn't love you. Explain it to her.
[33:13] Natasha, if Faizan is telling you something again and again then try to understand it. Ponder on it. It might be true. Why aren't you getting it?
[33:25] Enough mother! I won't hear any other word against Raazi
[33:30] Keep your hatred to yourself. I would never get manipulated against Raazi. I trust him a lot
[33:54] Really? Are you telling the truth
[33:57] Yes! I keep my word and brother Saliq too. Now you should also keep your word
[34:04] Ofcourse, don't you worry. Tell me this, when are you getting my other work done?
[34:13] Consider it done. I asked brother Saliq to throw a party tomorrow. And I have convinced Faizan to bring Hadia there. After the party, brother Saliq would take his share and fly to Dubai, and Hadia would be out of Faizan's life.
[34:33] Very good! Does it mean?
[34:36] Catching two birds with one stone
[34:41] Listen, you remember the plan?
[34:45] Yes, I got everything you told me. Don't worry about it. By the way, its a a difficult task but since you are my old friend I have to do it
[35:00] Thank you Zohaib! Don't you worry, let me enter Safdar Kamal's house for once then you'd see that I'd take care of you too
[35:16] Its not about that. Look, its a tricky plan so we have to execute it carefully. But remember Ramsha, if I'd get caught then I won't spare you too
[35:30] Yes I know that you can execute it very well. Just remember one thing, stay in touch with me during party. And don't do something that Faizan would catch you
[35:49] Faizan shouldn't have any doubt about it. Got it?
[35:54] yeah!
[35:55] Good!
[36:01] You did right thing by coming here
[36:05] I missed you a lot
[36:08] I too missed you a lot my child
[36:17] mother, are you worried about something? You look too worried
[36:25] No, there is nothing like that
[36:30] You are hiding something from me. Tell me truly what is it? Your eyes are swollen too
[36:37] what do I have to hide?
[36:41] Look, Safdar has found out that Raazi used to like someone
[36:47] what? Brother Raazi and sister Hadia ..
[36:51] No, not that. 
[36:55] Then?
[36:56] that is what he didn't find out. Thanks to God that He saved my child's dignity
[37:03] then about which girl brother Raazi told uncle?
[37:09] mother, I'm not getting it. Tell me in detail
[37:15] what do I tell you?
[37:32] and Raazi has agreed to get married next month. I also had to say yes forcefully
[37:42] so soon?
[37:43] What could I do, my child? Things were getting complicated
[37:51] and I can't see my son in this condition. This is why I also said yes
[38:02] Mother, its always unfair with brother
[38:10] May God make everything alright. Ameen
[38:14] Sister Hadia's necklace?
[38:17] I don't understand what kind of person this Faizan is. He tells fake stories to everyone. Poor Hadia was embarrassed in front of everyone. May God have mercy on both kids
[38:34] what can we do? Mother, tell where is brother Raazi right now?
[38:40] He's at office. Meet him and go
[38:44] Yes! I'll call brother Raazi and tell him that I'm here
[38:49] I forgot to ask about Hamza in this all. Why didn't he come?
[38:56] Mother, it is him who dropped me. He was in rush. He had to go somewhere.
[39:03] Okay! What about your visa?
[39:09] I got it, mother. This is why I came 
[39:12] Really? Thanks to God
[39:16] Thanks to God that I had to hear some good news finally. Now go there and stay happily
[39:23] but mother, I'd be far from you.
