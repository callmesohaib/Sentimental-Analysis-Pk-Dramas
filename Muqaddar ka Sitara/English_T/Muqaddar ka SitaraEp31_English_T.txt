[03:04] God... 
[03:08] just now you came back from your mother's house, isn't she done yet?
[03:13] she was asking about my well being
[03:16] Hadia look, keep less contact with your family
[03:21] your sister Fizza, she calls you at every odd hour & wastes your time
[03:27] and your parents! don't they care a bit that its their daughter's in-laws house. They shouldn't come here so often
[03:36] if it will continue in this manner then it will be so bad, tell them to stay in their limits
[03:42] understand?
[04:14] hello! listen, Faizan is here. I just saw his car
[04:19] alert your entire team
[04:22] and listen! the acting should be really good
[04:26] Faizan shouldn't get to know that we've planned all of this
[04:30] and yes! I've explained the entire plan to my mother as well
[04:35] Okay
[04:51] hello listen!
[04:54] who are you? why do you come here?
[04:57] we've been noticing your visits over here since so many days
[05:00] so?
[05:02] who are you guys to question me? And how did you guys came inside?
[05:05] get out of here! I will complain to the landlord about you
[05:10] don't give us threats
[05:12] so?
[05:13] this is the society of respectable people, understand!
[05:16] this will not work here
[05:18] what will not work here? What rubbish are you talking?
[05:20] respectable & honorable people like us live here with our families
[05:24] and the environment of our society is getting bad because of licentious people like you
[05:29] and respectable people like us cannot live here anymore
[05:32] by the way, tell me one thing. What relation do you have with this girl?
[05:36] she is my cousin, ask her!
[05:38] but we have heard that they don't have any relatives in this city
[05:42] and its just you who visits here on regular basis
[05:45] are you having an affair with that girl?
[05:46] whatever the relation is, who are you to ask me?
[05:49] Ok tell us, who are you? and by what status you come here?
[05:54] and what relation do you have with that girl?
[05:56] hey! what is this happening?
[05:59] what is this drama!
[06:01] how dare you to enter my house & talk rubbish!
[06:06] get out right now, otherwise I will call the police
[06:09] we will call he police
[06:11] this is the society of respectable people, this won't work here!
[06:15] what are you trying to say? We are respectable & honorable people
[06:19] and you guys have no right to raise finger on our character & that too in our house
[06:24] Ramsha be quiet, let me talk
[06:27] what will you talk about? I will talk to them myself
[06:31] this guy is my cousin & my to be husband! are you guys satisfied now?
[06:36] now get out! and don't even think of stepping in our house ever
[06:42] lets go
[06:43] come on go... get out!
[06:46] everyone comes inside uselessly. Get out!
[06:51] who.. 
[06:58] Ramsha...
Ramsha
[07:10] Hadia look, keep less contact with your family
[07:15] your sister Fizza, she calls you at every odd hour & wastes your time
[07:21] and your parents! don't they care a bit that its their daughter's in-laws house. They shouldn't come here so often
[07:36] what happen?
[07:38] nothing
[07:41] is there any problem?
[07:45] I am making coffee, would you like to drink?
[07:48] by the way you make such a nice coffee, but I don't feel like drinking it now. Thank you!
[07:55] you enjoy
[08:04] what was the need to argue with those people!
[08:08] now they will defame you in the entire neighborhood
[08:11] mom, I did absolutely correct
[08:13] we should be talking to such people like this
[08:16] we are respectable & honorable people. Nobody has the right to raise finger on our character!
[08:22] and to talk rubbish about us!
[08:25] what if we don't have a man in this house. But we do have some respect
[08:30] I can't tolerate anymore
[08:32] that's why I don't like this country
[08:36] hey Faizan, don't say anything this country. Our country is really nice
[08:41] but the people in here & their thinking is quite low
[08:45] Now I am worried about her
[08:47] its so difficult for us to live here after so much had happened
[08:53] who will accept her after so much of insult & humiliation?
[08:57] oh God! please show some mercy on us. Honestly, a daughter is such a big burden
[09:06] I will try to reduce my visits here
[09:10] I was expecting the same from a coward & a loser guy like you!
[09:14] you made my spectacle in the entire society, you got me defamed
[09:20] and now you will leave me? I knew it that one day this will happen
[09:26] the situation is in front of you
[09:28] I don't want to create more problems for you
[09:31] I have a better solution, let me get you guys shifted to a better colony. We'll find a house in some better place
[09:36] leave it, nothing is going to change. What will happen by going to a new neighborhood?
[09:42] I have a request
[09:44] stop following my daughter, leave her alone!
[09:48] mom!
[09:49] be quiet!
[09:51] what do you want? Shall I die like this?
[09:56] I shouldn't see you getting married?
[10:01] I will wed you off in my life
[10:04] I pray to God that he sends a nice guy, so that I can wed you off with him
[10:09] No! I won't marry anyone else except Faizan
[10:14] if not Faizan, then nobody else. Got it?
[10:19] and Faizan, listen to me very carefully
[10:23] if you didn't marry me within 2 days, then I will kill myself in real
[10:30] oh Ramsha... Ramsha!
[10:35] I think, I should be leaving
[10:37] listen!
[10:40] do make a decision when you come next time
[10:43] my daughter is not so cheap that she shall ruin her life for you
[10:49] you've hurt my daughter so much
[10:53] first, you had hurt her by marrying Hadia and now this
[10:59] go away from here
leave!
[11:02] and don't come here next time
[11:05] go away from here!
[11:33] Natasha
[11:36] I've been apologizing to you since so many days
[11:40] for God sake please forgive me
[11:43] please don't make me mad. I am already having a headache
[11:50] see, I am going outside with my friends for a while
[11:54] in fact, do one thing. You also come along with me, your mood will get changed
[11:59] I don't want to go anywhere. You go
[12:02] see, come with me by considering me your friend if not a husband
[12:06] you don't go out at all since you came here
[12:13] lets do one thing, let me take you for a dinner today
[12:17] shall we?
[12:27] please come Natasha, I am waiting
[12:33] Ok go
[12:35] I am changing
[13:04] take more
[13:06] I had told you, Faizan will not marry me
[13:10] he is such a stubborn & coward guy
[13:13] we won't be able to grab him so easily
[13:15] this plan is also failed
[13:18] now think for another plan
[13:20] do something that Faizan gets compelled to marry me within 2 days
[13:25] hmm... 
[13:27] I have to think about something
[13:29] let me use my brain
[13:32] but you have to promise me
[13:34] that even this time, if we couldn't handle Faizan 
[13:38] then you will have to marry as per my choice
[13:42] see, Mr. Razzaq is restless to get married to you
[13:47] No! don't be angry. First, listen to me 
[13:52] he is 60 year old man, he can die anytime
[13:57] you will get the entire wealth after his death
[14:00] and see, he is transferring the ownership of such a big bungalow & some share of wealth in his life. What else do you want?
[14:08] and after his death, you can marry a young & handsome guy. That's it!
[14:12] don't take that old man's name in front of me!
[14:16] I don't want to marry him. Nor I want to ruin my life
[14:23] Faizan is not just handsome & rich but stupid too
[14:28] he is quite an easy target
[14:31] and I will ensure to get him
[14:34] Okay I accept
[14:37] that maybe you get married to Faizan
[14:41] but you won't be getting anything. Neither wealth or properties
[14:46] because until Faizan's father is alive, he won't give you guys a single penny
[14:52] nothing will be possible for you
[14:55] I will make the impossible possible. Just wait & watch
[15:05] you've ruined my pizza
[15:08] eat some more, take it
[15:12] enough
[15:37] hello! what happen, you look quite upset
[15:47] what happen? Enjoy.. have fun
[15:50] excuse me! stay in your limits Ok?
[15:53] you are reacting as if you've come here for the first time
[15:56] hello! what are you doing?
she is my wife
[15:59] Sheery! what do you think you are doing?
Leave him!
[16:03] I will break your legs if I see you here again
[16:47] what was the need to raise your hand on him?
[16:52] you've made my spectacle in front of all
[17:01] he was misbehaving with you
[17:04] So? how does it affect you?
[17:07] you didn't talked to me for once after going there
[17:10] now if somebody misbehaves with me or not, what goes of you?
[17:15] the previous times were different & now the matter is different
[17:21] if it was in my control, then I would have broken his face
[17:24] there is no need to become a hero!
[17:27] honestly! if you wouldn't have come in between then I wouldn't have spared him
[17:31] enough! there is no need to do drama
[17:35] you are such a selfish & deceitful person
[17:38] who knows, there is some motive of yours behind saving me
[17:44] it would have been good if I would have died
[17:46] what is the benefit of such a useless life?
[17:49] what do you mean by this?
[17:50] I had lied to you
[17:53] I had betrayed you
[17:55] I did wrong by hiding my status
[18:03] I got the girl whom I had loved the most
[18:09] but I won't be able to get her love & trust in my entire life
[18:21] and I know
[18:23] that soon you will leave me, & again I will be left alone
[18:29] maybe loneliness is written in my fate
[19:04] today I've made your favorite breakfast, piping hot flat breads & eggs
[19:11] really! very nice
[19:14] In the name of Allah, most gracious and merciful
[19:20] wow!
[19:22] you've refreshed my childhood memories
[19:27] my mother used to make such kind of flat breads when she was alive
[19:31] Hadia has got the taste of her mother's cooking in her hands
[19:35] sister, the women in the house should know how to cook
[19:39] because even a top class chef doesn't match the taste which a woman of the house have
[19:45] yes, absolutely correct!
[19:47] because it has got love & care along with the hard work
[19:55] aunty, please have some
[19:57] next time make the menu after discussing with me
[20:00] Safder don't eat such a heavy breakfast in weekdays
[20:05] we don't like such an oily food, specially me
[20:09] but I've prepared everyone's favorite breakfast
[20:13] Safder is not allowed to eat all these things
[20:16] there is no harm in eating this sometimes
[20:19] she has made it with a lot of love, and it won't harm you if you will have some. Taste a bit
[20:25] yes aunty, these flat breads are prepared with organic butter & its not harmful
[20:29] my father had brought it from Hyderabad, its pure
[20:32] tell him not to do this formality next time, I am allergic to the smell of organic butter
[20:39] Najma, bring my breakfast to my room
[20:53] no problem, I will eat
[20:56] let me go & give aunty's breakfast in her room
[20:59] No dear leave it, Najma will serve her
[21:02] I wanted to discuss something important with you & Faizan
[21:09] yes dad
[21:10] I am having a discussion with a Chinese brand, its quite a famous one
[21:15] and if God wills then we'll confirm a deal with them on this weekend
[21:22] congratulations to you Safder. May God bless your business with a lot of success. Amen
[21:30] thank you so much sister, all of this is because of your prayers
[21:36] so have you finalized any location?
[21:38] yes, I've marked a location in Islamabad.
I want you to take Hadia along with you
[21:44] check that location too & this way you guys will get to do an outing
[21:49] and I am sure that you will not disappoint me like your Malaysia's trip
[21:56] I'll make sure not to give you a chance to complain
[21:58] but dad, how will he study? Just now he has started to go to the university
[22:03] its not a big deal
[22:05] study & business can be managed side by side
[22:08] its not a big deal. And I am not asking him to join the office on a regular basis. He can visit sometimes
[22:14] at least, he should attend business meetings with me & Razi
[22:19] this way he will learn
[22:21] Razi, get their flight & hotel booking done
[22:27] be ready to go there
[22:29] I don't need his help, I will do all the arrangements
[22:47] Okay.. please have some
[23:28] your doubt was absolutely correct
[23:32] Sheena must have hurt Hadia's feelings
[23:36] didn't you see, how she left the breakfast prepared by her
[23:40] the poor girl had made it with a lot of hard work
[23:43] true
[23:45] but I don't understand, why sister Hadia hid this matter from me?
[23:50] although she knows that I am her well wisher & always think good about her
[23:56] the poor girl got scared of her mother in law. She doesn't want the matter to be exaggerated
[24:01] that's why the poor girl is tolerating everything quietly
[24:06] yes
[24:08] poor sister Hadia
[24:11] but there is one thing, Thank God that Faizan is treating her well
[24:16] and Safder is also sending them for an outing
[24:18] its a good thing, that they will spend sometime together. And the poor girl will stay away from Sheena for a while
[24:25] mom leave it, brother Faizan will never fix himself
[24:29] and I will always doubt him
[24:32] do you know, what brother Razi was telling me
[24:35] brother Razi was saying, that brother Faizan goes to meet someone else by making an excuse of going to the university
[24:39] what!
[24:40] yes
[24:42] So, did he inform Safder?
[24:46] No
[24:48] he is doing wrong, I will make him understand
[24:52] No mom let it be, there is no need to explain him. He is already very disturbed
[24:59] and do you know, what brother Faizan did?
[25:02] he has ruined the entire decorum of the office in a few days. That's why brother Razi doesn't want him to come to the office
[25:09] but this cannot happen
[25:11] after Safder, Faizan have to look after the entire business as he is the only heir
[25:16] and what about Razi, he is an employee over there
[25:20] yes
[25:37] quickly get ready, you are getting late for university
[25:40] what is the matter, you are quite energetic today
[25:43] yes, the matter is as such. Aren't you excited to go on a honeymoon?
[25:49] what's there to be excited about?
[25:50] I am so happy, we are going somewhere for the first time
[25:53] it will be such a good weather over there, we'll take a lot of pictures together
[25:57] and after that we'll make an album of it. So that our memories shall stay safe
[26:02] I will start the packing today, do let me know what do you want me to keep for you
[26:04] you are getting so over excited, its not like this will be the first & last trip of our life
[26:11] I am not getting excited to go on a trip, but to spend time with you
[26:16] you hardly give me any time here, as you go to the university in the morning & come back at night
[26:23] the trip that you... we aren't going for an outing
[26:26] dad is sending me off with a responsibility. I have to work there, I don't want to disappoint him
[26:36] Hadia, its been a lot of time that we got married
[26:38] and you aren't coming out of the thinking of the honeymoon
[26:41] Come out the world of fantasies, its the real world
[27:32] I was about to call you
[27:38] Ramsha, I won't be able to meet you for some time. We have to be careful, otherwise it will be a problem
[27:47] what happen, why are you crying?
[27:49] mom has fixed my wedding with Mr. Razzaq
[27:53] he will come to marry me next week
[27:56] what!
[27:58] has she gone mad! how can she do this?
[28:01] Faizan, mom made this decision by coming into people's pressure
[28:04] I go defamed in the entire society because of you & you don't care a bit
[28:10] mom was compelled to make this decision
[28:14] but I have clearly refused
[28:17] I have said to her, I will only marry Faizan!
[28:21] no matter if I have to wait for ten years
[28:24] Ramsha, you know I cannot take this decision right now
[28:28] its not the time
[28:30] fine! then let me go & tell everything to your wife
[28:35] are you insane!
[28:38] are you black mailing me?
[28:39] you haven't left any other option with me, Faizan
[28:43] I have already wasted a lot of time on you
[28:47] everyone thinks that we are engaged, that's why nobody looks at me
[28:53] Faizan, you have betrayed me
[28:55] you have left me for nowhere
[28:58] Faizan, if you won't accept me then where will I go? What will I do?
[29:04] and now, I don't have any other option left except for telling the entire truth to your wife
[29:12] Stop me if you can! 
I am coming to your house today
[29:16] Ramsha, listen to me. You won't do any such thing.
Ramsha!
[29:23] Ramsha!
[30:09] your suggestion worked
[30:13] her behavior has started to change a bit
[30:16] Okay! now don't waste time. Take her to her father's house as soon as possible
[30:23] she is a golden sparrow, she will change your life
[30:26] she is quite stubborn & she is adamant on her words
[30:30] for how many more days I will keep her? How will I manage her expenses?
[30:34] but she hadn't come empty hands
[30:37] you had told me that she had brought cash & jewelry along with her
[30:41] yes, she had brought. But I don't want to break her trust so soon
[30:49] then do one thing
[30:52] Straightforwardness with the straightforward, crookedness with the crooked
[30:58] what do you mean?
[31:00] I mean, go outside the house by making an excuse of doing some important work
[31:04] I will send a few guys at your house and we'll pretend it as a robbery. How is that?
[31:11] you are right!
[31:30] I had told you not to do this!
[31:33] and what I had said to you. Don't you value my words?
[31:37] for God sake Ramsha, stop doing childish acts
[31:39] if dad gets to know that you are here, he is going to disown me if we get married,
[31:43] what is with you? I had explained you all
[31:46] you are so coward & useless too!
[31:50] you are dependent on your father's wealth
[31:52] what do you have of your own? Nothing!
[31:54] fine! I don't have any thing. I have nothing! I am coward & useless
[31:59] but imagine, if we get married then what will you get? I won't be able to make you do the shopping of your choice
[32:06] Faizi, I am in love with you
[32:09] I love you!
[32:10] I can manage a simple lifestyle with you
[32:14] I don't have any interest in your wealth, I just want you
[32:18] I understand Ramsha, Ok?
[32:21] but we cannot discuss this right now, you go home. We'll discuss this in peace, please!
[32:25] move away from my way. I don't trust your words anymore!
[32:29] again you will appease me by going back home
[32:35] Ramsha what's wrong with you!
[32:38] what do you think? Everyone will greet, welcome you inside? And will get us married?
[32:43] its not going to happen!
have you forgotten what my father did last time?
[32:46] and this time he got me married with the girl of his choice
[32:52] you want to go inside, go! go & create a drama
[32:55] what do you think, this time he will send you to Dubai? I don't think so
[32:59] he will kill you directly, Ramsha
[33:01] go
[33:26] you should have gone to his house immediately
[33:29] and should have told the entire reality to his wife
[33:31] so mom, I had gone to do the same thing. But Faizan didn't let me go inside
[33:36] he had ousted me from outside
[33:38] you've spoiled my entire planning! what not I had thought
[33:44] oh Ramsha you!
[33:46] you don't care about me at all? What if I had died then?
[33:50] you know how dangerous Faizan's father is!
[33:54] leave it! its not an easy task to take someone's life
[33:57] Faizan had threatened you & you came back home
[34:01] my heart says that he will marry me for sure
[34:05] it is better to remove your delusion as soon as possible
[34:10] when I told him that I will wed you off with Mr. Razzaq. He didn't supported you, then how will he support you now?
[34:17] No!
[34:19] he will come, you'll see
[34:22] he will come for sure
[36:37] Natasha
[36:41] Natasha
[36:44] yes, tell me
[36:47] Natasha, I am going outside for an important work
[36:50] where? what work do you have?
[36:54] actually I had asked my friend about a job, so I am going to meet him
[36:59] till when I will sit idle?
[37:02] previous times were different, and now its different
[37:06] you are my responsibility
[37:08] I accept that I cannot give you those luxuries, but you won't face any problem in this house
[37:19] take care of yourself
[38:48] Ramsha
[38:50] go away from here
[38:52] I don't want to see your face even
[38:55] why?
[38:56] first of all you did such a childish act & then you are getting upset!
[39:00] what if dad would have seen you then? what if he had harmed you then?
[39:03] it would have been good! you could have got rid of me
[39:07] then you could have stayed happily with Hadia
[39:12] it my life's biggest mistake that I had fallen in love with you
[39:17] stop it Ramsha, stop it!
[39:21] why are you wasting your words in front of such a person, who doesn't care about your love
[39:27] Faizan will never marry you
[39:30] never!
[39:31] because he loves his wife a lot
[39:35] why are you tiring yourself by crying in front of him?
[39:38] but I cannot live without Faizan
[39:42] if I didn't get him then I will die
[39:44] then go die!
[39:47] if you cannot live without him then go die, but he won't marry you
