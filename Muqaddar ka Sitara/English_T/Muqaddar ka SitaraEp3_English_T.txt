[03:28] Come Safdar.
[03:47] This is the five-canal land that I mentioned. 
[03:52] It's suitable for a mosque and a small hospital.
[03:59] As God wills.
[04:02] I feel it's very suitable but you're the buyer.
[04:23] Thank you.
[05:24] Do you know, I like the atmosphere at brother Aleem's house. 
[05:32] Meeting him feels very comfortable.
[05:37] The family's love and devotion show how families ought to live and how to value relationships.
[05:56] Do they still live in that deserted mansion? 
[06:01] They could have at least gotten some renovations. 
[06:04] I'm scared of going there, what if it falls on my head?
[06:09] No auntie, their mansion is very nice. 
It's built anciently but they have maintained it well.
[06:18] I think Razi, your taste is rather antiquated.
[06:25] But brother Aleem is a humble and gracious human being 
[06:30] and his wife Khadijah, she's also very nice.
[06:34] Yes mom, they gave us a very good protocol
[06:39] Of course. They will give you the protocol. You went with your uncle.
[06:48] Dad, it's not good that you stayed the night in Hyderabad yesterday.
[06:52] You know I had a reservation at the restaurant.
[06:56] I had to cancel it because you didn't come.
[06:59] I'm sorry dear, our car broke down and we had to stay there.
[07:04] Why did you cancel the reservation?
[07:08] You could have taken your aunt along.
[07:13] Dad... You're the limit...
[07:18] By the way, I feel you staying there without a reason was an excuse only.
[07:22] You must be enjoying yourself. They are being so hospitable to you, and why wouldn't they be?
[07:29] You have done them so many favors.
[07:32]  Even them licking the dirt off your feet wouldn't be enough for them to repay you.
[07:36] What favors are you talking about?
[07:39] How many things should I remind you of?
[07:42] For the elder daughter, you had a school made and for the younger daughter, you're having a hospital made.
[07:46] Enough Shina.
[07:49] I'm not doing this for brother Aleem, I'm doing it for myself. 
[07:53] It was my late father's wish...
[07:56] to build a school. 
[07:58] Brother Aleem's daughter has done us a huge favor by teaching there, to date. 
[08:02] As far as this hospital & mosque is concerned...
[08:05] I'm doing all of this to make my Lord happy and you...
[08:12] Forget about it, Safdar. Stop talking about it and eat your dinner before it gets cold.
[08:19] I've already eaten, sister. Excuse me.
[08:22] Safdar... listen to me...
[08:26] He gets upset over little things. Don't worry Shina, he'll get better soon.
[08:32] Why don't you take something? How about flat bread?
[08:36] This is my home, and I'll eat whatever I want. If you guys have eaten...
[08:42] then I'll ask the driver to drop you guys home.
[08:45] Farewell.
[08:56] Let's go, mother.
[08:58] Listen to me...
We came here to eat and we've done that.
[09:03] Besides, all of your hosts are gone. I'm waiting for you outside.
[09:06] Alright... what's gotten into you?
I'm waiting for you outside!
[09:11] What's gotten into him? He has such a short temper.
[09:25] Shall I give you bread?
Sure, give me a slice.
[09:35] What happened to that boy?
What boy?
[09:40] I'm talking about Faizan... I don't think you'll have your way there as well.
[09:46] I think you're underestimating me.
[09:51] Leave it be.
You were so confident about Junaid as well.
[09:55] That is possible. But experience comes with time.
[09:59] If you spend your entire life waiting for experience to come, then nothing will come your way. 
[10:03] Life is not all about experiences.
[10:06] To spend a good life, one always needs money.
[10:11] Mother, Faizan is very different from Junaid.
[10:14] Yes, he's short-tempered and emotional, but I'll be able to handle him.
[10:21] Did you talk to him about marrying you?
[10:23] Yes, I did, but he's asked for some time.
[10:28] Some time? It's been so long since you two have been friends, how much time does he need?
[10:35] Mother, stop stressing out.
[10:38]  I know that Faizan will not marry anyone else but me.
[10:43] Think carefully about it.
[10:45] I don't want you to be left empty-handed.
Mother, why do you worry so much?
[10:51] If Faizan doesn't even marry me, even then I'll be able to extract a lot of money from him.
[10:58] By the time I'm your age, I'll have a lot of money to my name. I won't be empty-handed at all.
[11:09] Hello...
This is Safdar Kamal speaking.
[11:13] Yes, what is it?
What price do you want to leave my son's life?
[11:19] Pardon?
[13:08] What's wrong with her? Why is her cell phone switched off?
[13:54] Hello?
Thank God you picked up.
[13:57] You're Hadia, right?
[14:00] you!
[14:03] Why did you come to school today?
Did you not like it?
[14:06] No, but... I was shocked that you were there.
[14:11] Did you tell your father about it?
[14:15] No, but... if you had come so far, you should have met him.
[14:21] Sure.. I'll meet him some other time maybe.
[14:26] Then what was the meaning of you coming so far from Karachi to Hyderabad?
[14:31] To tell you the truth, I came here to see you.
[14:55] I can't believe what you're saying, Safdar.
[15:00] Meaning is there no other girl for our son, than that illiterate girl!
[15:05] That illiterate girl is better than that girl...
[15:09] The girl your son has chosen. By the way the girls you just called illiterate...
[15:14] is a university graduate and she's running a primary school.
[15:20] She's an educated and kind girl, who can bring our son on the right path.
[15:26] She can educate the next generation. Please don't become your son's enemy by opposing her.
[15:32] Alright fine, I'll accept what you're saying.
[15:37] For a moment, think that I've accepted what you're saying...
[15:41] But still, Natasha will never agree with Razi.
[15:45] I'm talking about Natasha, I'm talking about you. 
[15:48] How do you think Razi is for your daughter?
[15:52] Safdar, these are modern children, if we enforce our decisions on them...
[15:58] then they can take a wrong step as a reaction.
[16:02] I'm not a stranger. I'm their father, whatever I'll think for them will be for the best.
[16:09] All I want is for you to support me.
Sorry, Safdar...
[16:13] I can't support you in this matter.
What kind of wife and mother are you?
[16:19] Meaning, you have no problem with your daughter marrying a non-muslim and your son marrying a girl like Ramsha?
[16:26] What kind of decisions are you thinking about taking?
[16:28] Decision? You've already taken a decision.
[16:33] You forced us to shift to Pakistan from America.
[16:37] Did you ask about our opinion? 
Somehow I'll find a way to force myself to stay here...
[16:43] but our children are not used to this environment...
[16:47] I have no idea what they will do here and how will they live here!
[16:50] Then tell me, what would they have done there?
[16:53] At least over here, they will develop respect and character. 
[16:57] And there will be no fear of them marrying non-muslim people.
[17:00] Why don't you understand? 
Please, Shina, help me, one last time...
[17:06] Sorry Safdar...
[17:09] I can't talk to them about this topic. I can't force them. They are modern children...
[17:15] I don't have the strength to talk to them.
Okay...
[17:21] Thank you very much. I'll talk to my children myself.
[17:27] Excuse me.
[17:50] By God's good grace, my son seems very happy today.
[17:54] Is there any special reason for that?
[17:56] No mother, please sit with me.
[18:02] Tell me something...
[18:05] What magic do you hold that you learn about what's going on in your heart before I do?
[18:11] A mother has no magic...
[18:14] A mother has a heart that can read their child's happiness and sorrow.
[18:19] But looking at you, anyone could have told, me how happy you are.
[18:26] Tell me, what were you looking at on your phone?
[18:30] Forget about that. What is her name?
[18:36] Hadia.
[18:38] She's uncle Aleem's daughter.
[18:42] Mother, I don't know why...
[18:46] Looking at Hadia, I fell in love with her.
[18:49] I realized that this is the girl I imagined...
[18:55] Mother, Hadia is my ideal...
[18:58] If it's like that, I'll visit brother Aleem this week and talk to him.
[19:04] What's the hurry mother... I mean...
[19:08] Let me first talk to Hadia, and see what she wants...
Oh really...
[19:13] My son has become so modern that he will first propose to the girl on the phone and then he will send her mother.
[19:20] What's wrong with it mother?
[19:22] No there's nothing wrong with it, but brother Aleem's brother is very traditional
[19:26]  and it's possible that Hadia doesn't like it as well.
[19:30] Then?
I'll visit brother Aleem and talk to him.
[19:35] He'll tell me whether he agrees, or disagrees.
[19:41] Can he refuse?
Yes.
[19:44] He has the full right to... but it doesn't seem that he will refuse.
[19:50] My God's good grace is one in a million. 
[19:53] Even if he searches the entire world over, he won't be able to find such a great son-in-law...
[21:25] Did I disturb you?
[21:27] You called me, even though I told you not to call me.
[21:32] I'm not your friend, otherwise, I could have said that I missed you.
[21:37] Say what you called me to say.
[21:38] I called to inform you that you haven't sent me the second installment.
[21:45] You'll get it by tomorrow.
Thank you so much.
[21:49] I'm sure that you will not forget it tomorrow. I trust you.
[21:53] But I don't trust you. Let me remind you that this will be the second and last installment.
[21:58] I remember, don't you worry.
Remember your promise.
[22:04] You will not come back to Pakistan, nor will you keep any contact with my son.
[22:10] Okay, uncle.
[22:54] Hello... I need the first available flight to Dubai. Yes, this is an emergency.
[22:59] Please, let me know asap.
[23:09] Faizan...
[23:11] What is going on? Where are you going?
[23:13] I'm leaving for Dubai, right now.
[23:17] Are you insane? You're leaving home for what wretched girl!
[23:22] No matter how she is, she's my choice and my father has no right to do this to me.
[23:28] Faizan... that girl took a bribe from your father to go to Dubai.
[23:34] Can't you see how vile she is... she's not interested in you, she's interested in your wealth.
[23:40] Father threatened her! This is what he always does, he wants to impose his will, all the time!
[23:46] He doesn't care about our choice at all! 
He's a dictator and I will never forgive him for this.
[23:50] Faizan, why are you getting so aggressive for that girl?
[23:55] When you know that she isn't worthy...
[23:58] And you said that you will not marry her, then why are you running after her?
[24:03] I made a mistake...
[24:05] I asked father to relax so that he let things go...
[24:10] But I don't care anymore. Let me be very clear...
[24:15] I love her, why is it so hard for you to understand that? I can't leave her.
[24:21] Faizi, what's wrong with you? Why are you arguing with your mother and father about that stupid girl?
[24:27] Stay out of it and worry about yourself. Father is marrying Razi, did you tell her about it?
[24:35] What? Mother, do you know about this?
[24:40] I cannot believe this.
[24:56] Father... what's wrong with you? How can you even think of marrying me to Razi?
[25:04] I've told you, I like David and I will only marry him.
[25:09] And I've also told you that will not happen, while I'm alive.
[25:14] What's wrong with you? How can I marry someone who I can't even look at?
[25:22] And he survives on eating your scraps, how will I manage to live with him?
[25:27] Look, my dear, I've thought long and hard before selecting Razi for you.
[25:32] He's a hardworking and respectful man. Soon he'll be standing with me. He's a bright future.
[25:39] You're the one who will do all of this for him.
[25:43] Can't you see, this is so unfair?
[25:48] And listen to me, I won't let this happen.
[26:11] Where's my passport? Do you have it?
[26:13] Please listen to me and try and understand.
[26:17] Don't be so angry. I'll talk to father and he'll convince Ramsha back.
[26:22] I don't care about it anymore. 
[26:24] Give me my passport if you have it. If it's somewhere else, tell me and I'll get it.
[26:27] Faizi, you're not going alone, I'm coming along as well.
[26:32] I can't live in a home where one can't even breathe on their own will.
[26:46] Are you sure?
[26:57] Safdar, please do something. Both of them are leaving home.
[27:04] They'll come to their senses when they'll be isolated for a few days.
[27:07] For God's sake forget about your ego and think!
[27:10] How can you be happy by snatching your children's happiness?
I'm snatching their happiness?
[27:17] I'm ashamed of your thinking. 
[27:20] Your son is going crazy over their vile woman and your daughter is dying to marry that non-muslim.
[27:28] They're right and I'm wrong.
[27:31]  I'm trying to find good matches for them so that they can be married to good families...
[27:35] then I'm their enemy.
It's not that. I want you to control the situation somehow.
[27:41] Do you want me to cheer them up? That will not happen, Shina!
[27:45] Even if they threaten me with suicide, I will not accept their wrong demands.
[27:51] I'm not asking you to agree with them.
[27:54] But just stop them from going. If they leave, they may never come back.
[28:15] Where are you two going?
[28:18] Out of the country.
[28:21] And me too.
[28:22] Without a passport?
[28:28] Meaning, you have the passports.
[28:34] I want my passport.
Even if I want to, I can't give you your passport.
[28:39] Because I have...
[28:42] burned both of your passports. Not only that...
[28:46] I've blocked both of your credit cards as well.
[28:51] You can only get these things back...
[28:56] when Faizan, you decide to marry Hadia and you decide to marry Razi.
[29:03] Never!
[29:07] I will never marry that illiterate woman!
[29:10] Illiterate you say?
[29:14] Who told you this?
[29:16] What do you know about her? I've never seen...
[29:21] She is such an educated and respectful girl like her. Brother Aleem and his wife have raised her exceptionally well.
[29:26] Lucky people find relationships like that and you...
[29:31] Who are you to reject her... pray that she agrees to marry you.
[29:38] Why would she refuse?
 She'll get such a rich and handsome man!
[29:42] They've taken your money all their life and now you're giving them a blank checkbook.
[29:47] No matter what you think... I've decided...
[29:53] He'll have to do what I say. Faizan will have to marry Hadia, at all costs.
[30:00] And Razi, there is no better man than him for Natasha.
[30:08] Then listen to my decision as well.
[30:12] If I can't leave this country, then I won't stay in this house.
[30:18] Faizan stop, please...
[30:22] I won't come back until he changed his decision.
[30:27] Until I'm alive, no one can force you two. But if you do this out of anger...
[30:34] then nothing will be left in your hands.
I am sorry mother...
[30:40] If you're stubborn, then you should remember that I'm your son...
[30:48] Faizan!
[30:56] Whatever you're doing isn't right...
[31:00] Your son has left home and you're daughter wants to leave. 
[31:03] What are you doing?
Whatever I'm doing...
[31:06] is for their betterment. I'm their father, not their enemy.
[31:12] I lose sleep thinking...
[31:14] about where my children stand and what they're doing. What haven't I done for them?
[31:20] You're not the only father who does this... many fathers do what you've done and some even do more than you.
[31:26] You're not doing anything special, nor are you doing anyone, any favors!
[31:29] You have never cherished my hard work and sacrifices.
[31:33] Don't forget who gave you...
[31:37] what you have.
After all, you're their mother, so you will speak their tongue.
[31:42] The paths your children have chosen...
[31:45] is taking them toward their downfall. How can I see them drown in front of me?
[31:51] How can I marry them into those places?
Our religion...
[31:55] allows us to marry whomever we want.
Alright, I won't enforce my decision on them...
[32:01] but I will not allow them to go where they want to go.
[32:21] Mother, where's my phone? Has father hidden that as well?
[32:28] This is so stupid! Does he think that hiding my phone...
[32:34] will stop me from contacting David? 
[32:37] I have lots of other ways to contact David, you do know that, right mother?
[32:44] He can't stop us from taking our decisions.
[32:48] Does he think he's done some exceptional by sending Ramsha to Dubai?
[32:54] It's nothing like that.
[32:58] Why don't you say anything? Please give me some cash.
[33:05] I want to make my passport.
[33:08] Natasha, do you trust me?
[33:11] I do.
Then wait a while, and see what I do.
[33:20] But please try to get me my phone.
[33:25] Thank you.
[34:36] Brother Aleem's family is very traditional, maybe Hadia won't like it as well.
[35:05] I'm sorry, I was dialing someone else's number and mistakenly called you.
[35:12] Alright, I'll hang up then.
[35:16] It's you... how are you?
[35:19] Leave it be... why are you asking me that? You mistakenly dialed this number, right?
[35:25] I was just... sorry...
[35:29] Then tell me the truth, why have you called? What business do you have with your father?
[35:34] To tell you the truth, I had no business with your father.
[35:40] Then who were you trying to call?
[35:43] You...
Oh really?
[35:46] Why?
I was just...
[35:51] To tell you the truth, I was calling you.
[35:53]  Ever since I saw you for the first time, I took a liking to you.
[35:56] Please before hanging up, listen to me.
[36:00] I was attracted to your simple nature.
[36:04] To tell you the truth you are as beautiful inside, as you are outside.
[36:10] I only wanted to call you because my family will be visiting you very soon.
[36:16] To talk about our marriage.
[36:21] I hope that you won't send them back empty-handed.
[36:27] I'll be waiting.
[36:33] Hello?
[37:03] I was attracted to your simple nature.
[37:08] You are as beautiful inside...
[37:11] as you are outside.
[37:38] Think about it... how can someone...
[37:42] be so strict with their adolescent children.
I'm surprised to hear that as well...
[37:48] I don't know why Safdar is doing that...
[37:50] I didn't realize that he would get so stubborn.
[37:55] Don't worry... I'll talk to Safdar...
[38:01] Sister, you have to refuse this proposal.
[38:05] Natasha will never agree to marry Razi. And if she is forced...
[38:12] then she can take a drastic step as well.
[38:17] If you hadn't even said that, it would have been very hard for me to do this.
[38:23] Because Razi likes some other girl...
[38:27] And it's obvious that I'm happy for my son. We have to visit them next week.
[38:33] If they say yes, then I'll set the date.
[38:40] That's very good.
If God is willing.
[38:44] Drink your tea...
