[01:09] I knew it! I just knew that this will take place. I don't know why Natasha had to go against everyone and do all this.
[01:20] Its in the past now! She was at mistake but we are a family, if we don't support her then who will.
[01:29] And you know she isn't fully mature yet! I'm sure if we support her, she won't make anymore mistakes and learn from the mistakes that she did.
[01:40] Mother and father will be really upset! We have to be there.
[01:44] I'll book the first available flight. You should start with the packing please!
[01:48] Okay! Don't you worry, I'll start with the packing.
[02:00] Hello! Kindly book the first available flight departing from Islamabad to Karachi. I'm sending you the detail via Whatsapp! Okay.
[03:25] Faizan!
[03:30] I won't let you slide that easily!
[03:43] If she still doesn't learn the lesson! She would never know her limits. She'll keep taking advantage of our love.
[03:52] Now leave it Safdar, She is your daughter! Try to understand her condition too.
[03:57] We are not the reason for her condition! She was at fault!
[04:00] We are also suffering because of her mistake!
[04:05] We cannot change the past! She needs us, so that she can escape the torture.
[04:14] And this is only possible when you personally forgive her!
[04:19] I've already forgiven her! But as a father, I hope she understands that she hurt me really bad.
[04:30] What didn't I do for her? I have fulfilled her every wish almost! But in return she decided to come up with this!
[04:42] She has realized her mistake! Now forget the past.
[04:49] Did you call upon me, Father?
[04:51] That boy shouldn't be left like this at all! He needs a lesson too!
[04:56] Don't you worry!
[04:58] Police are already searching for him but they fear, he might try leaving the country.
[05:04] Police has a registered his name and details in ECR! He cannot hide for that long.
[05:10] You guys can stay calm! He'll be caught soon.
[05:12] He did what he had to. Pretty much destroyed my daughters life.
[05:17] Now what will we get by getting him punished?!
[05:20] Justice!
[05:22] In this whole procedure, we'll be the ones feeling embarrassed !
[05:28] We cannot forgive such a big criminal, just because of embarrassment!
[05:33] These type of people should be punished who play with the life of women.
[05:41] He mentally tortured Natasha! He betrayed her.
[05:50] This bastard must be punished.
[05:55] I wish! My kids had the same thinking. I wish!
[06:52] If father didn't forgive Natasha, what will happen with me? He would disown me when he gets to know that I secretly married Rimsha! Everything will be ruined, I'll loose everything.
[07:07] This won't happen! I cannot let this happen! This should be kept as a secret.
[07:15] What about Hadia?! If she finds out.
[07:21] She would leave me immediately! But why am I worried about her.
[07:32] Why am I scared off her getting her upset! Why do I feel like hurting her.
[07:41] I think I've started to like her!
[07:48] I'm cheating on Rimsha too! this cannot happen.
[07:56] I'll have to chose one from both of these! Rimsha or Hadia.
[08:11] Please inspector! This boy shouldn't escape at all. Try searching him with all your force! Please find him.
[08:28] Sure! I'll visit the police station tomorrow. Thank you and regards.
[08:34] Raazi! Natasha is back home. Now leave that boy.
[08:40] No mother! I won't sit peacefully until this bastard gets punished.
[08:47] And I have promised uncle that I won't stop until they get justice!
[09:00] I think you are in love with Natasha!
[09:04] Love?
[09:11] Love only happens a single time!
[09:18] This heart doesn't beat for anyone anymore.
[10:08] I'll be back tomorrow! I'll spend the whole day with you.
[10:13] No need to now! Stay with that Hadia of yours. I die or not! You should not worry anymore.
[10:48] Hello! I am really sorry Rimsha. I know it's my fault! I cannot spend my time anymore. Please try to understand.
[11:00] But I promise! I would spend the whole weekend with you after coming back.
[11:03] You'll have to come directly to me from the airport! It's just been 4 days since our wedding, and you left me alone. I'm your wife! I'm also a part of your life.
[11:16] Listen! I tried, but the weather's bad. All flight are canceled.
[11:21] You are lying again! Faizan I'm not that dumb! That every time I'll get fooled. I'm not like that Hadia.
[11:29] I saw her profile! I can see you smiling and enjoying in all her photos.
[11:35] So what should I do! Should I just leave her like that? What do you want me to do?
[11:42] Listen Rimsha! Please promise me that you'll cooperate. You are not keeping your promise, Okay?
[11:47] You are absolutely right! It's all my fault! That I put trust in you and married you.
[11:55] What is wrong with you! I think you are forgetting that I married you on some terms!
[12:00] That I'll stay with Hadia and spend time, and you won't hesitate or pressurize me!
[12:08] And If father finds out ! He'll never forgive me. I don't know what's gonna happen after that.
[12:14] I'll go and tell your father the truth myself!
[12:20] I'll tell him myself that I made a big mistake by trusting and marrying your son.
[12:26] Rimsha! you are again blackmailing me and pressurizing me. Please don't do this.
[12:34] Listen! I just want you to not call me that often. I don't want Hadia finding about us right now.
[12:41] Hadia! Hadia! Hadia! I'm tired of listening to this name!
[12:49] Hadia doesn't find out about us! Hadia doesn't get hurt! Hadia this, Hadia that! Faizan ! Am I not a part of your life? Where do I stand?
[13:00] Please understand me! Try to understand my compulsion Rimsha. Please!
[13:05] You are continuously lying to me, making me a fool. And you want me to stay silent!
[13:49] It was a normal accident! Some tissues are damaged, and there's swelling too. I am prescribing some medicines! Go for the X-ray if the swelling stays !
[13:58] This means I'm all good! We should get going, as we have a flight at 2 O'clock. Lets get ready!
[14:02] No! You cannot travel in such a condition.
[14:05] What condition Hadia? I'm all good!
[14:08] It'll take some time for your wounds to heal! Try not to travel in such a condition.
[14:13] He needs a complete rest for three consecutive days! I'm prescribing some more medicines. I'll check him tomorrow too.
[14:19] Ok! Take care.
[14:22] Thank you doctor!
[14:23] Your welcome! Thank you.
[14:42] Hadia we really need to go! I'm Okay!
[14:45] Faizan! What has happened to you. I understand that you are upset for Natasha but at least just listen to the doctor!
[14:53] I'm in a normal condition. I can walk, I can talk. I'm okay!
[14:57] You never listen! Do you know, how much will your parents be worried if they find out.
[15:04] Please don't tell them. They already are depressed due to Natasha!
[15:08] But first promise me one thing!
[15:12] What!
[15:12] You'll have to get complete bed rest for some days! I have always listened to you always. Please listen to me because I cannot compromise on your health
[15:25] Okay! Sure!
[15:28] Nothing more! Just take good care of yourself. I'll go make some soup for you.
[15:50] I have sent you the mail! Check it. Sure! Update me as early as possible!
[16:02] Here! Drink some tea.
[16:08] Thank you!
[16:10] Raazi! I'm really happy with you son.
[16:15] You have made me proud in front of my brother and his wife.
[16:19] I feel like I have returned the courtesy my brother on me, just because of you!
[16:28] I didn't do that much, mother!
[16:29] You did! You brought Natasha safe and sound back to home!
[16:34] I you wouldn't have reached in time! there must have been something bad going on.
[16:39] And your uncle will never forget this favor of yours.
[16:43] Mother! I didn't do this to return as a favor to him.
[16:50] Its my duty.
[16:51] God bless you son! I'm always proud of my kids.
[17:03] Thank you!
[18:36] Mother! Mother!
[18:41] Coming darling!
[18:45] Here! I have placed some good food in there! Enjoy it with your friends.
[18:50] Wow! Thank you so much mother! Now I know that you love me more than Hadia !
[18:57] Fool talks!
[18:59] Daughter! If you are ready, let's go.
[19:03] Sure father! I'll miss both of you.
[19:08] Quickly get your studies completed! Then I won't let you leave anywhere. Take care of yourself.
[19:14] Sure!
[19:15] I don't feel comfortable that you live in a hostel but on the other hand you also want to graduate as a doctor.
[19:25] Now I'll go! Take care of yourself, please.
[19:29] My darling! Sure!
[19:31] Lets go!
[19:32] Goodbye! Goodbye!
[19:46] Hello! Greetings! How are you doing.
[19:50] Greetings! Thank God I'm fine and healthy!
[19:55] You guys were worried about Natasha! I thought it'll be good to inform you that she is back home, safely.
[20:03] She is back? That is so nice to hear, Thank God she is back.
[20:08] Is Safdar satisfied?
[20:12] No Safdar is still hurt! I hope he forgives her soon.
[20:20] We were also really worried and praying for her! Today my husband asked again about her.
[20:28] How did she come back?
[20:30] Raazi brought her back! And the boy who married her, Raazi is also taking care of getting him properly punished.
[20:39] May God bless your son! He is such a gentleman! He always there for others.
[20:47] Amen! Remember him in your prayers.
[20:51] Sure! Take care of yourself! Goodbye!
[20:55] Goodbye!
[23:32] Hadia! now you should sleep.
[23:36] I cannot sleep!
[23:40] Don't lie to me! I can clearly see from your eyes that you are sleepy.
[23:45] I won't let you sleep till your temperature normalizes! I'll go get the thermometer!
[23:51] Leave it!
[23:56] Help me sit!
[24:23] You are not taking any rest! You haven't slept at all. Are you not tired?
[24:31] I love taking your care! I just want to be there for you my whole life! Now you won't go on walks alone.
[24:44] You actually love me that much?
[24:48] You are suspicious about my love?
[24:57] Can I ask you something?
[25:02]  A hypothetical question! If you ever find out I cheated on you, will you still love me the same way?
[25:15] What are you talking about?
[25:18] I'm a human! I can make mistakes!
[25:21] No you cannot! I know you will never.
[25:26] You've also left that Rimsha! Now no one else is there to interfere between us.
[25:33] No one!
[25:39] Hey! Faizan! Why are you so lost!
[25:47] Nothing! I'm just sleepy, you should also sleep.
[26:53] Hey Rimsha! after talking to you I had an accident. I cannot come early, as it might take 3 days for recovery.
[27:05] So you should take care of yourself! My phone will be off so it wouldn't be possible for you to contact me.
[27:15] Take care of yourself! I love you.
[28:11] I'm too worried about Safdar! As a father, I cannot imagine what he'll be facing right now.
[28:27] It would look good if we also go and ask about her! In such situations, only the real ones are there to help.
[28:38] But when I think about Safdar's wife, I know she won't appreciate such a deed.
[28:47] You are right! It won't look good if you go there right now.
[28:56] Sajida was telling that everyone is too depressed. Natasha is in a bad condition! She fainted when she entered the house.
[29:07] She got hurt pretty bad! It's obvious that it'll take some time for her to stabilize.
[29:16] I'll just call Safdar on phone and ask if they need anything. You tell me, that when are Hadia and Faizan coming back?
[29:27] After hearing about Natasha! They were coming early, but Faizan fell sick. Now they'll come in some days. Don't worry, Hadia is in contact!
[29:39] Then I'll just call and ask about Faizan's health.
[29:46] Sure! do it.
[30:00] Rimsha! Why have you called me here so urgently?
[30:04] Zohaib
[30:07] I need your help
[30:11] help? mine?
[30:12] Ramsha I have already told you that I can't help you further now
[30:18] why Zohaib?
[30:20] I really need your help
[30:22] you'd have to go with me to Islamabad to meet Faizan
[30:26] I take you to Islamabad to meet Faizan? I am already regretting after leaking information to you
[30:34] and by the way
[30:35] why do you want to go to Islamabad to Faizan?
[30:40] , actually there is a thing
[30:42] that you don't know
[30:45] Faizan and I ..
[30:47] have got married
[30:49] what? What rubbish are you saying? How can he get married to you? He has already got married to Hadia
[30:55] you know it well that he used to love me before that Hadia came
[31:00] he was about to get married to me
[31:03] He only got married to Hadia under his father's pressure
[31:09] oh!
[31:10] this means
[31:13] Faizy is betraying Hadia?
[31:16] Exactly Zohaib
[31:18] Also, that Hadia doesn't deserve Faizan
[31:21] you'll see
[31:23] I will take my Faizan away from that Hadia
[31:27] and you'd help me in this
[31:31] Look, I don't know what are the complications between Faizan and Hadia
[31:36] I don't know. But I'm not helping you Ramsha
[31:39] Zohaib, you will have to help me
[31:41] Otherwise you know it well what can I do?
[31:46] You'll take me to Islamabad
[31:49] Got it?
[31:56] Good!
[32:02] I'm too bad
[32:07] I have hurt you all a lot
[32:11] Father is right
[32:14] I don't know my ..
[32:16] good or bad
[32:19] Natasha ..
[32:20] have patience my child
[32:22] why are you hurting yourself thinking about it?
[32:26] what's done is done. It was written in fate
[32:29] no one can change it
[32:31] and you'll see ..
[32:33] in future, things will be easy for you
[32:35] and you'll get a wonderful partner
[32:38] no auntie
[32:40] no good person deserve me
[32:46] I have ruined my life myself
[32:54] look
[32:56] my dear daughter
[33:00] whom ..
[33:01] we brought up so delicately
[33:04] with love
[33:08] why did this happen to her?
[33:12] People have such good fate
[33:16] they get everything that they don't have
[33:20] like Hadia
[33:24] and my daughter
[33:26] don't say that Sheena
[33:28] a person learn from his mistakes
[33:31] and sense comes after bad times pass
[33:44] how are you feeling Natasha?
[33:49] she's been crying constantly since yesterday
[33:52] she hasn't eaten anything
[33:55] Farwa, why have you got this all?
[33:58] you didn't come for breakfast so I brought it here
[34:02] I have no mood to eat
[34:05] try to feed her
[34:09] auntie, you haven't eaten anything since last night too
[34:12] I don't want to eat anything, please
[34:14] Please eat something
[34:17] why won't you?
[34:22] don't listen to her
[34:24] forcefully feed her
[34:27] have this
[34:29] I told you, I don't want to eat
[34:31] Are you gone mad, Natasha?
[34:37] I have
[34:39] When I'm telling you that I don't want to eat then why are you forcing me?
[34:46] Please, leave me alone. Go from here
[34:55] Natasha, we know that you are too tensed right now
[35:02] everything will be fine. Don't you worry
[35:10] I don't need false sympathies
[35:14] sympathies aren't shown to people who are our own
[35:17] we take care of our people
[35:20] and we all love you a lot
[35:22] and are worried about you
[35:24] do you realize that your parents haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[35:32] you ..
[35:33] don't mind
[35:35] actually ..
[35:36] she is going through mental stress
[35:39] mental stress?
[35:42] why don't you tell the truth? That I have gone mad
[35:46] I have ruined my life, mother
[35:51] don't say that my child
[35:53] I have gone mad
[35:55] I couldn't understand what was happening to me
[35:59] I couldn't figure out what was happening to me
[36:07] I made a joke of myself
[36:10] all relatives would come to show sympathies to me
[36:14] although they won't be feeling sympathetic
[36:17] they'll come only to see my drama
[36:21] they'll talk about me. I'm going mad
[36:27] I am hating myself
[36:32] I don't want to live this life
[36:51] what is this?
[36:53] where are you going?
[36:55] I'm going to Islamabad with Zohaib
[36:58] Don't you worry. I'll come back soon
[37:00] Islamabad?
[37:01] but why?
[37:03] and who is this Zohaib you are going with?
[37:06] He is mine and Faizan's mutual friend
[37:08] He told me that Faizan has gone for vacation with Hadia, and not on business trip
[37:13] it doesn't mean
[37:14] that you go behind Faizan
[37:16] why not?
[37:17] he'd keep telling lie and I don't do anything?
[37:20] when he doesn't care about me, then why do I?
[37:23] Do you know he made a promise to me that he'd be back by morning today
[37:27] and now he's making excuses. He has switched off his phone
[37:30] He's telling me that he had an accident
[37:32] but actually, he's spending time with Hadia
[37:35] it might be possible that he's right
[37:37] that might be true
[37:40] don't follow Faizan now
[37:42] or else he'd get annoyed and end this relationship
[37:45] look I had already explained it to you
[37:47] I'm explaining it again
[37:50] this wedding happened after so much hard times
[37:52] and you have to fulfill this relationship
[37:55] look
[37:55] if you'd be emotional like this
[37:58] then Faizan would divorce you?
[38:01] he can't even think to divorce me
[38:05] from where will he bring 50 million rupees?
[38:17] How is he now?
[38:21] I did talk to him in the morning
[38:24] My child, he was praising you a lot
[38:28] he was saying ..
[38:30] you are taking good care of himself
[38:33] I liked it
[38:36] no my child
[38:38] there is no need to come back now
[38:41] and ..
[38:42] As far as Natasha is concerned, we are here. We will handle her
[38:46] You people spend time there. There is no need to come now
[38:50] okay my child, bye!
[38:53] uncle?
[38:55] yes my child?
[38:56] what's the news?
[38:58] Uncle, police has found Sherry
[39:01] he is under arrest right now
[39:04] thanks to God
[39:07] I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if this hadn't happened
[39:10] uncle
[39:12] police had a raid at his friend's place
[39:15] they found Natasha's things from there
[39:18] jewelry .. cellphone .. other things too
