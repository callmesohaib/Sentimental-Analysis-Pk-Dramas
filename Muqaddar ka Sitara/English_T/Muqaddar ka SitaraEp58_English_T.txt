[01:03] You have no relationship with this house anymore.
[01:09] Your friend is gone now.
[01:15] And you've already ousted your daughter-in-law.
[01:22] Go away from here.
[01:36] I'm deeply saddened by what happened. Not only was he my friend, he was my brother,
[01:50] Because of him...
[01:54] I want to give Hadia another chance.
[02:02] If she wants to forget her past and live with Faizan, then I'm willing to take her back.
[02:20] I don't want any favors for your forgiveness.
[02:29] My past was never shameful that I would want to forget about it.
[02:37] Everyone makes mistakes.
[02:43] But the wisest of us are the ones who accept our mistakes.
[02:50] Do you still hold me responsible?
[03:01] Your father wasn't able to bear this pain.
[03:07] One of us is responsible for this.
[03:18] Then what is the need in forgiving me and taking me back home?
[03:26] If you still doubt my character...
[03:34] then send me the divorce papers.
[03:41] Otherwise, I'll have it sent to you.
[03:48] I can sacrifice every relationship for my character.
[03:55] I don't want to live with your son.
[04:01] You can go from here.
[04:51] May God forgive his sins, amen,
[05:00] What happened? Who was it? Why did you get so upset?
[05:05] Brother Aleem has died.
What?
[05:08] How can that be?
There isn't any good news related to them.
[05:14] I don't understand. What happened so suddenly that took away his life?
[05:20] I heard that her elder daughter was having an affair with Safdar's nephew. After that brother, Aleem had a heart attack...
[05:31] Really... Shina was right then. I thought she was speaking the truth...
[05:40] What do you mean? What are you saying?
[05:43] A few days ago I was talking to Shina on the phone, and she was speaking ill about her daughter-in-law.
[05:50] But I didn't pay much attention to it. But now I'm shocked at how all of this can happen.
[05:59] I don't know how brother Aleem raised his children. But it's good that we don't have any association with them.
[06:07] Otherwise, we would have had to endure so much concerning these girls.
You are right.
[06:13] It's good that this relationship is over. But brother Aleem was a good man.
[06:20] May God forgive his sins.
Amen,
[06:24] There is no need for you to tell anything about this to Nisar. It was hard for him to forget about all this.
[06:31] I don't want that girl to be mentioned in this house again.
[06:35] Yes, don't worry, he won't find out about this.
When did he say that he was coming back?
[06:40] He'll get here tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow.
As soon as he comes back, prepare for his wedding.
[06:47] Please get me a cup of tea.
Sit down, I'll bring you one.
[07:33] Forgive me, brother Aleem.
[07:38] God be my witness, I didn't want to be cruel.
[07:43] If I made a mistake in haste, then I ask for your forgiveness.
[07:51] You leaving this world...
[07:55] is a source of great sadness for me.
[08:01] I have never forgotten your favors.
[08:05] I will never be able to... I tried repaying them by making Hadia my daughter-in-law, but...
[08:16] but I wasn't able to. You leaving like this has increased the burden on my heart.
[08:49] Where are you preparing to leave?
Mother, think that my prayer has been accepted.
[08:56] And now it's time for me to touch the sky.
Have you achieved something again?
[09:03] It's nothing small that I've achieved. Faizan is now under my control.
Enough of these riddles and be straightforward.
[09:13] Faizan has finally told his family about me, and he's also asked to pack.
Really?
[09:23] Yes, now only I will be Faizan's wife and Hadia's chapter is now closed.
[09:31] That is amazing news. I'll go pack my stuff as well.
[09:39] Mother, actually I can't take you with me right now.
[09:43] Why not? You promised me that you will take me wherever you go.
[09:51] I want to go to that big house as well.
Try and understand. Let me make my place in that house first.
[10:01] Then I'll call you to me.
Promise me...
[10:06] that you won't forget your mother.
How can that happen?
[10:11] Alright, when is Faizan is coming?
He didn't tell me that, but he said that he'll be here soon.
[10:19] I don't trust Faizan. He never comes when he says he will. I don't think he'll come this time as well.
[10:26] Why don't you go there yourself?
[10:31] I should go myself?
[10:33] Why not? Faizan has already told everyone about you there. Go that and take your right.
[10:41] I don't know about that... what if Faizan gets upset?
Forget about him... he's a coward.
[10:49] He doesn't know anything other than being afraid. You have a right over that home...
[10:54] Go there and live peacefully.
I don't know. I don't want to be hasty...
[11:00] and ruin my entire plan.
As you wish. But I'm very happy to hear you're going there.
[11:10] Don't forget me, alright?
Forget that and help me pack...
[11:16] Why are you taking these old clothes? You'll get new clothes there.
[11:22] Bless you... don't forget me.
[11:36] Hadia...
[11:40] My dear...
[11:45] Your father has left us...
[11:51] He left us here alone.
[11:58] Fizza's engagement has broken off as well.
[12:05] I was thinking...
[12:10] that you should accept what brother Safdar said.
[12:16] Compromise...
[12:21] At least your happiness can be salvaged.
What happiness?
[12:29] In this one year of marriage, I haven't seen a day of happiness.
[12:36] And the few days I did find happiness, turned out to be fake as well.
[12:45] This child's presence is the only thing that forces me to smile.
[12:51] Otherwise, I'm starting to forget how to smile. What happiness are you talking about?
[12:58] My dear, I was just...
Mother, I'll accept every one of your commands...
[13:04] but asking for forgiveness means that I accept that I had an affair with Razi...
[13:13] And that night I was the one who called him there.
[13:18] And if I go to that home after accepting something like that, then what respect will I have left in front of the people inside that house?
[13:30] I'll be taunted and my character will be blown to shreds every day.
[13:37] How can I endure all of this? I can manage to tolerate my in-laws' taunts...
[13:45] if my husband were to trust me. But for me...
[13:51] there is no ounce of respect for me over there. For whom should I apologize then?
[14:02] Forgive me, my dear.
[14:06] I didn't want to give you more pain by saying this.
[14:11] No mother...
[14:15] Nothing you say ever brings me pain...
[14:21] But I just cannot crush my self-respect...
[14:28] and go back there. Forgive me...
[14:35] And I can also understand that...
[14:41] life doesn't stop when one dies.
[14:49] We cannot turn away from the truth.
[14:55] That's why I have decided...
[15:00] that I will...
[15:05] run father's school so that we can get by.
[15:11] I'm with your sister. I will help you...
[15:36] Faizan is involved with some girl.
[15:46] He talks to her on the phone and he meets her every day.
[15:53] And he even buys her extravagant gifts. He just bought her a set worth twelve lacs.
[16:06] For Natasha, you need to find a good man from a good family, but don't worry about me.
[16:15] What do you mean?
[16:18] I've already married.
[16:20] With Ramsha.
[16:50] Safdar your medicine.
[16:55] Why did you go there when you know that you get unwell on such a long journey? We don't have anyone we know there as well
[17:03] You shouldn't go there for no reason.
[17:07] Please, I'm in no mood to talk right now. Please go.
But Safdar...
[17:10] I said please go.
[17:52] Mr. Razi, this is Ramzan speaking.
[17:56] You had some investigation done about Fawad?
Yes, I did. Did you find any information about him?
[18:03] Not only information, but Fawad is also sitting right in front of me.
[18:09] He has said a lot of things. If you want to find out something more, please come to the office.
[18:15] Very good. Thank you so much. No matter what happens, don't leave him. I'll be right there.
[18:22] Okay alright.
[18:29] Thank God.
[18:42] I've packed all my stuff, shall we go now?
[18:48] Sorry Ramsha, we can't go now.
[18:52] Faizan, you told me that you were going to take me with you.
[18:58] Then why are you turning away from what you said?
[19:05] Faizan, what is all this? How much longer will you keep playing with my emotions?
[19:11] I'm not playing with my emotions but please understand that I cannot take you anywhere right now.
[19:19] But why?
[19:22] Hadia's father has died, that's why.
[19:29] What's that have to do with you not taking me to your home?
[19:35] What's the matter with you?
[19:39] Why can't you take Ramsha home with you? She's your wife.
[19:46] And your home is her home.
Father is very upset. He was his childhood friend and his relative.
[19:54] I haven't told my father about us yet, only my mother.
What?
[19:59] You still haven't told father about us?
I told you Ramsha...
[20:07] Faizan is a cowardly man, we cannot trust him. But you didn't believe me... do you see now?
[20:17] Ramsha trust me, I will tell him when the time is right. But not now.
I don't trust anything you say anymore.
[20:25] Can you both please calm down?
[20:31] I'm already worried, and you two are only adding to it.
I said that I'll tell you, so I'll tell you.
[20:39] That time will never come.
[21:13] Mr. Razi..
Greetings, how are you?
[21:18] This is Fawad...
[21:23] He's taken money before to do these things before.
[21:27] There are many complaints against him. That's why he keeps switching cities...
[21:35] This time intended to stay in Nawabshah. He came back for his mother and we caught him.
[21:42] These are his phone call details.
[21:47] The rest is up to you.
[21:50] Thank you so much. You have given me the entire information.
[21:55] Thank you very much and thank you for permitting me as well.
[22:00] Thank you.
[22:17] I don't want to read these details.
[22:22] Who asked you to do this?
[22:26] Because I know that you're a serial blackmailer.
[22:30] Tell me.
[22:40] Fawad, time is precious, for you and me. Cherish it.
[22:46] I can have you out on bail...
[22:51] only if you tell me the truth. Otherwise, you'll be in jail for at least five years.
[22:57] I request you to tell me the truth and we'll forgive you.
[23:06] I didn't know her.
Wait for a second...
[23:21] Now speak.
I didn't know her...
[23:26] I met her at university. She asked me about Fizza...
[23:34] and after knowing a few things about Fizza...
[23:39] she asked me to do this.
[23:45] How much money did you take?
Ten lacs.
[23:53] Fawad, the thing I'm about to ask you now...
[23:56] tell me the truth about it. It will save you from this.
[24:02] Who was behind all this?
Mrs. Safdar Kamal.
[25:05] Enough my dear.
[25:08] Control yourself.
[25:14] Life doesn't end when someone leaves. It pains me to see you this way.
[25:20] Please come and sit with us.
[25:25] Enough father.
[25:29] Stop with this false affection.
[25:36] If you really loved me, then bring back Razi.
Don't say his name.
[25:44] Don't say his name. He is a liar who betrayed us all!
[25:51] No father...
[25:55] You know better than me that he can betray us.
[26:01] My heart still testifies that Razi has done nothing wrong. We are the ones who are doing wrong by him.
[26:08] Father, you know that Faizan alleged him. He has done nothing wrong.
[26:15] Father, please bring him back home. Don't do this.
I told you...
[26:21] I cannot do this. I'm sorry.
[26:57] Sir, there is someone called Razi here to meet you.
Razi?
[27:03] Here? Call him.
[27:10] What is he doing here?
[27:56] I don't have anything greater to prove Fizza's innocence.
[28:04] The truth is that I came here to tell you guys the truth about this.
[28:10] I can't believe that someone can stoop so low.
[28:15] But... I can't believe this. What can compel someone to hate someone so much?
[28:24] Auntie Shina... she was the reason.
[28:30] Auntie wanted to marry Natasha to your son Nisar.
[28:36] But you guys took a liking to Fizza. You guys decided to marry your son to Fizza.
[28:43] That's the thing...
[28:46] that auntie didn't like and this is how she took revenge.
[28:52] Oh my God.
[28:55] Shina is such a sly and vindictive woman.
[29:01] Razi... we didn't hear anything great about you as well.
[29:15] I know what you are speaking about.
[29:22] I will not prove my innocence to you.
[29:27] But I will say that is exactly the way how auntie defamed Fizza...
[29:37] Faizan defamed Hadia.
[29:45] That's the truth.
[29:56] Did Shina feel no shame alleging her daughter-in-law like this?
[30:05] We should be ashamed as well. We made a grave error.
[30:13] We alleged that an innocent girl.
[30:18] Nisar was right. We were hasty in this.
[30:24] Auntie, I have a request. It would be great if you guys pay attention to the decision you made...
[30:33] It's possible that everything might get better if you try.
[30:40] But my dear, I don't think Khadija will agree to his relationship again.
[30:49] Auntie please, I'm asking you to do this. Please try.
[30:55] We are ashamed that we made such a grave sin, but we will try because we want this.
[31:07] Thank you so much, sir.
[31:43] What's the problem?
[31:46] Who are you calling?
I'm calling a friend. Zohaib isn't picking up either.
[31:52] Zohaib what's the matter? Why aren't you picking up? Call me ASAP, I need to talk to you.
[32:03] I was calling Salek as well, but he isn't picking up either. I need to talk to him as well.
[32:09] When you talk to him, please ask him to call me. The bank called me and told me that some papers are missing. I don't know what to do.
[32:17] Please call me back.
[32:23] Did you talk to Zohaib?
No, I haven't talked to him for a while.
[32:30] Try calling him...
My phone is charging and you'll talk to him for hours.
[32:38] It will only take two minutes.
[32:58] Why isn't he picking up? Where is he?
[33:04] He must be busy, you can try later.
Lord knows where he is. I'll be right back.
[33:24] Hello... Zohaib, we were saved by an inch.
[33:30] Otherwise, Faizan would have learned everything.
[33:33] What happened?
Faizan was the one who was calling you from my phone a while ago.
[33:40] Thank God that you didn't pick up.
[33:43] Yes... he's called me seventy times since morning.
[33:47] Why aren't you picking up? He'll suspect something. He's been calling Salek as well.
[33:55] Brother Salek has left for Dubai, what would I have told Faizan?
[34:02] I think we'll get caught now, I'm very scared.
[34:07] Faizan has got a call from the bank as well. He's gotten notice that there are some papers missing.
[34:14] That means that I should leave as well.
Yes, leave as soon as you can.
[34:30] Natasha is getting worse.
[34:35] She hadn't forgotten about Sherry...
[34:39] and now she is in a damaged state because of Razi.
[34:43] I don't know why my daughter's luck is so bad.
[34:50] And I always told you that Razi was a greedy man but you never listened to me.
[35:06] Hello...
Mr. Safdar, did I disturb you?
[35:12] No, what is it, Mr. Siddiqui?
I wanted to discuss something important with you...
[35:18] I wanted to find out if you had sold your fruit factory.
[35:25] No... why would I sell that? I transferred that factory to Faizan.
[35:31] There were some problems with the payment of the taxes.
[35:36] When I visited the factory, I heard that its owner had been changed.
[35:46] And while discussing this, I learned that this factory had been sold by Faizan Kamal to Taimoor Qureshi.
[35:54] And after a few days, the documents have been transferred to Salek Masir.
Salek?
[36:03] The criminal builder that lives in Dubai?
But how?
[36:12] How can Salek have the factory when I never wanted to sell it to him?
[36:20] I'm sorry Mr. Safdar... but it seems that Faizan Kamal sold it.
[36:27] Faizan... how can he sell the factory against my will to that cheater.
[36:34] I want all the information. Where was this meeting held and who is involved in this?
[36:40] Please I'm waiting.
Sure, I'll get the entire details and call you back.
[36:47] Did you know all of this?
No Safdar, I didn't know this.
[36:51] Enough Shina... tell me the truth.
[36:55] Faizan cannot do anything without your approval.
[36:58] What else have you hidden from me?
I'm telling you the truth. I don't know anything.
[37:04] When have you ever... hello...
[37:12] Sir, I have one more piece of news. The account manager has told me...
[37:16] that Faizan has stolen millions from the company accounts.
[37:20] He has transferred that money to someone called Ramsha...
[37:24] The account manager told me that Faizan has married Ramsha in secrecy.
[37:41] No Zohaib you don't understand. If Safdar Kamal finds out that Faizan's factory has been sold...
[37:48] then it will be trouble for us. He must know Salek as well.
[37:54] Our name will be joined with Salek's as well.
What nonsense? We didn't buy it, nor did we sell it.
[38:03] Zohaib, you're not understanding... Safdar Kamal will not ask who sold the company.
[38:10] He will ask for all the information.
[38:16] And then... will he not ask Faizan how he met Salek...
[38:21] And Faizan doesn't know that Salek is the one who bought the factory using a fake name which is Taimoor Qureshi.
[38:30] Now what?
[38:33] I feel very afraid. My life was about to get set...
[38:39] Faizan was about to take me to his home and now this new problem has come out of nowhere.
[38:45] No... Ramsha, you are worrying for no reason. It might be that the bank called Faizan because of some other reason.
[38:55] Whatever it may be... we need to be very careful.
