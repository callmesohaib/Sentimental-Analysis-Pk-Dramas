[01:18] Dad have you forgiven me?
[01:26] May be I'll make a lot of mistakes in the beginning but we learn this way, isn't it?
[01:36] But if I get your guidance and trust, I'll learn to overcome my mistakes. Please trust me.
[01:48] And if you find it right, you can send me in your place.
[01:54] Alright then,
[01:57] get ready to go to Malaysia.
[02:00] Hadia will go with you.
[02:04] Dad what will Hadia do there?
[02:08] Its an official tour. We'll be working. She'll be bored.
[02:14] But you guys got married recently. She'll look around as an excuse.
[02:18] I'll get her visa urgently.
[02:22] But she doesn't have a passport. I don't think it can be done this urgently.
[02:30] Alright you go ahead. Next time.
[02:43] Thank you dad.
[03:15] Have you understood Mr. Asif?
Yes sir, I've understood.
[03:24] Razi please come and sit down.
You called uncle?
[03:28] Yes dear, this is Hadia's passport. Get her an urgent visa, don't care about the money.
[03:35] Hadia's passport. For what?
[03:40] Sorry dear, I forgot to tell you. I should have told you earlier.
[03:44] Faizan is going to Malaysia.
[03:47] I know nobody could have done this better than you
[03:52] but Faizan needs to learn right.
[03:56] He proclaims he'll be able to do big things but I'll know whether he is capable or not.
[04:08] Yes. Yes.
Thank you dear. Thank you.
[04:14] I'll get it done.
Okay dear.
[04:31] What does uncle think of me?
[04:35] He doesn't care for my respect or my emotions.
[04:41] That day he wanted to sacrifice me because his son was being stubborn.
[04:54] And he didn't even apologize
[04:58] and now..
[05:03] it was such a good chance for my career and he gave it to Faizan.
[05:18] There's no payback for my hard work and sacrifices.
[05:26] Mom, where have you brought us?
[05:31] Uncle is as selfish as his wife and children.
[05:40] Are you really going to Malaysia?
[05:43] Wow amazing. What will you get for me? How many days are you going for?
[05:50] Only four days?
[05:52] Its your honeymoon you should go for about two weeks at least.
[05:57] Alright, I'll tell mom. Bye.
[06:01] Mom?
[06:03] Yes dear?
[06:05] Do you know Hadia is going to Malaysia for her honeymoon?
Really?
[06:10] Yes.
[06:12] Oh wow. Is she happy?
[06:15] Yes dad. She's very happy.
[06:18] See I told you our daughter will be very happy there.
[06:23] Thank God.
[06:25] You didn't make me talk to Hadia, Fizza?
[06:28] Yes mom I wanted to but she needed to pack. She said she'll call before she leaves.
[06:37] Do you guys want tea?
[06:40] Sure.
[06:42] I'll just get it.
[06:44] Thank you God.
[06:47] Please keep our daughter happy always.
[07:01] What are you doing? You're packing for yourself? Where is Faizan?
[07:08] Do you know she's going to Malaysia with you?
[07:12] What? No. No way?!
[07:17] Who told you you're going with me? Did you talk to dad yourself?
[07:22] You don't even have a passport? How did you get a visa?
[07:26] Don't you know?
[07:29] Uncle got it made on urgent basis through Razi.
[07:32] What is this? I will not take her along. Talk to dad.
[07:36] Either she goes or I'll not go.
[07:39] My trip will be destroyed. Talk to him.
[07:49] Its the limit. Your husband is insulting you and yet you're adamant to go.
[07:57] Do you know how much your uncle is upset with Faizan?
[08:03] And now since he has a chance to get himself recognized why are you interfering?
[08:11] I will not disturb him.
[08:15] What do you mean you'll not disturb me? You will not disturb me when you go with me.
[08:22] Mom, all my trip is planned and my friends are aligned as well. Please.
[08:28] This is the limit.
[08:30] Its not even your fault.
[08:33] You came from Hyderabad to Karachi for the first time and now since you're getting a chance for an international trip for the first time, why will you turn it down?
[08:44] This isn't the last trip. You can go next time.
[08:55] Faizan, you should compromise.
[09:00] I am compromising. How much more do you want?
[09:05] She's not going on the trip with me. That's it. Talk to dad.
[09:18] You are absolutely shameless. I didn't realize that.
[09:25] Alright I won't go.
[09:27] Alright then go and tell your uncle?
[09:31] What?
[09:34] Yes, make an excuse. Tell your sister is getting engaged or something, lie.
[09:39] Why should I lie?
[09:42] As if you never lied before. What will one lie do?
[09:47] Why don't you tell him that Faizan doesn't want to take me along?
[09:52] Alright. I'll tell him something myself.
[10:17] Ask her yourself. I've called her.
[10:22] Uncle you called?
[10:24] Sit dear.
[10:28] What happened you're still here? Why didn't you go with Faizan?
[10:34] Actually I had packed everything but then I felt sick.
[10:39] Faizan wanted to cancel but I said I'd go next time.
[10:45] Is that so?
[10:49] Yes, you can ask auntie.
[10:57] Yes Safdar she was unwell last night.
[11:02] Alright.
[11:04] Dear why do you call us uncle and auntie?
[11:08] Call us mom or dad, mama or baba like Faizan and Natasha but not this. Please.
[11:16] Okay dad.
[11:17] Thank you dear. Please ask Parveen to send us two cups of tea.
[11:23] I'll make it myself.
[11:25] Why do you have to make it yourself? When we have so many servants...
[11:30] Why should you do this?
Oh.. its nothing.
[11:34] Whats wrong Sheena? If she wants to make it let her do that.
[11:44] As it is, I get bored in the house. There's nothing to do here.
[11:49] Hmm. So lets do one thing.
[11:55] You'll take charge of the evening tea. You'll make it for us daily.
[12:02] Of course. Why not?
[12:03] I was just kidding. I just want you to stay busy because you get bored.
[12:12] In fact do one thing.
[12:15] You should manage things around the house. Take a few things as your responsibility. It'll kill your boredom.
[12:25] So wasn't it being managed before?
[12:28] Of course they are being managed Sheena. What I mean is that Sheena she'll help you around and her boredom will be treated as well.
[12:35] Also, Hadia if you want to change something, ask Farwa, she'll help you.
[12:41] Thank you dad. I'll get tea for both of you.
Sure.
[12:51] At least leave an opportunity. Once at least.
[13:18] Mom? Mom.. See whose there.
[13:22] What happened?
[13:24] Oh Faizi.. You. All praise to the Lord.
[13:27] Thank God, you're here. She has destroyed yourself crying for you.
[13:33] That's why I'm here.
[13:34] If you give us permission, I want to take her for dinner.
[13:37] No. You must be tired.
[13:39] Sit down and I'll make dinner for you.
[13:41] Actually I have no time. I have a flight for Malaysia at night.
[13:45] I had a connecting flight. I got time in transit so I want to spend it with her.
[13:48] Alright, its your wish.
[13:51] But be careful. She's still weak. See how much she's glowing looking at you.
[13:59] She was absolutely drained a little while ago.
Of course I can see.
[14:05] I'll go get ready. You talk to mom.
Sure.
[14:08] Come sit.
Hurry up.
[14:10] She was so unwell. I was so worried. I didn't understand what to do with her.
[14:33] Oh wow Ramsha. You were absolutely right.
So you now believe me?
[14:40] Who else will I believe if not you. But do something strong this time.
[14:45] Don't you worry.
[14:47] Try to make him stay for two days at least. And,
[14:52] tell me one thing. Why is he here? Is everything alright?
[14:55] Look at him. Does it feel something's wrong?
[14:59] He seems absolutely fine. And now don't doll up so much. You just came back from the hospital.
[15:06] Oh I forgot that. Should I lessen the lipstick?
[15:09] No let that be. You look good. Tell Faizan you got ready for him.
[15:14] Just be careful when you walk. Walk slowly and don't eat anything spicy.
[15:20] Tell him the doctor allowed you a few things to eat only.
[15:24] Wow you told me a great thing.
[15:26] Who will tell you something good, if not I?
[15:29] Now I'm going to sit with him, get ready and come down. I'm excited.
[16:05] What do you think, should we set this portion?
Why not?
[16:09] What if aunties scolds me?
Why would she?
[16:14] When the head of the family has allowed you, why would she scold you? Do whatever you like.
[16:23] And you're their daughter in law you have all the right to do what you like.
[16:30] Alright, lets start then.
[16:32] Fine, where should we start?
I think lets start from here.
[17:13] Call Hadia and ask. She might have reached Malaysia by now.
[17:19] She had a morning flight, didn't she.
Yes she did.
[17:24] She didn't go.
[17:26] She got food poisoning and brother Faizan went all alone.
[17:30] Oh God. My child.
[17:34] I don't know why mom, I think Hadia is lying.
[17:38] Brother Faizan must have left her here deliberately.
[17:41] No dear this is wrong.
[17:44] You're accusing Faizan without a reason.
[17:48] As it is its not easy to get a visa. You don't know the mess.
[18:09] Oh I'm so tired. But it was fun. Now this room has become worthy of seating.
[18:18] What do you think? Will auntie be happy and let me set the other parts of the house?
[18:22] Why won't she? You changed the look of this room without spending anything. She will not object.
[18:32] Then? Do you want to do more right now or tomorrow?
[18:38] Alright, lets do it.
You're enjoying as well. Come on.
[18:53] Who made all these paintings?
[18:56] Brother Razi made these.
[18:58] He's very creative.
[19:01] Even though he studied the dry subject, business administration but he didn't quit painting.
[19:11] Farwa?
[19:13] yes Mom, I'm coming. I'll just listen to mom and come.
[20:19] You? What are you doing here?
[20:57] What are you doing here?
[21:24] You threw this picture
[21:28] but what about the picture in my heart?
[21:31] I hate you.
[21:32] You're lying.
[21:34] You didn't hate me.
[21:38] I saw the true colors of love in your eyes for myself, Hadia.
[21:44] You thought my love was not much important since Faizan was so rich?
[21:47] Those who flirt often blame others. I'm not at all surprised.
[21:56] And the only purpose you have these pictures is to get me insulted in front of Faizan.
[22:04] You're accusing me Hadia.
[22:10] You're not doing right.
[22:51] You threw away this picture but what about the picture in my heart?
[23:18] You're here and I was looking for you everywhere.
[23:21] Mom made tea and fritters. Lets have them.
[23:26] You go ahead. I'll freshen up and come.
[23:34] Alright.
[24:11] I hate you.
[24:23] Those who flirt often blame others. I'm not surprised at what you said.
[26:28] Afzal look at the plants, they have wilted.
[26:31] They'll be better once I separate the weeds. I'm looking after them but..
[26:37] Whats happening here?
[26:40] Sheena auntie, Hadia..
You be quiet. I'm not asking you. I'm asking Hadia.
[26:48] How dare you make changes in my garden?
[26:53] Please leave from here.
[26:54] Yes mam.
[27:00] Only whatever I want will happen in this house.
[27:05] Safdar allowed you to kill your boredom but you!
[27:10] You got serious about changing how the house looks!
[27:18] If you want to work, go help Najma in the kitchen.
[27:25] And you, why are you always surrounding her?
[27:29] She's our daughter in law. She'll stay here. But you, you're a guest. Stay like a guest.
[27:42] Keep everything back in its place.
[27:54] sister Hadia,
yes
[27:57] I'm so sorry you got scolded because of me.
[28:00] You were not at fault.
[28:03] Its all my fault. I advised you that we'd set the lawn.
[28:09] Don't be stupid. Come,
[28:12] lets ask brother Afzal to keep everything back.
Everything looked so good.
[28:18] Its alright. Lets get this back.
[28:38] Why did she say this to me mom?
[28:44] I feel as if she is under a big misunderstanding from my side.
[28:51] What could be misunderstood now?
[28:57] Mom, even I don't understand this.
[29:00] I was shocked when she called me a cheat.
[29:06] Every girl says this later since they don't have anything else to say.
[29:12] Its easy to accuse others.
[29:15] No mom. Its not that.
[29:21] What I mean to say is,
[29:24] I feel as if there was a big misunderstanding between us.
[29:31] Really! And who would that be?
[29:36] See dear, you wouldn't be able to find the one who created the misunderstanding and the reason.
[29:48] Razi, dear, she is married now. 
[29:52] Even if the misunderstanding between you two is cleared,
[29:57] it might make a soft corner in her heart for you 
[30:03] and this won't be correct for the two of you. 
[30:09] Don't act like the devil dear. 
[30:14] Don't weigh out your entire life for this temporary love.
[30:39] What happened to you?
[30:41] I don't know what is auntie's problem.
[30:44] Its very wrong. She's elder than you. Show some respect.
[30:49] So she should also realize that. 
[30:53] She competes for the smallest of things.
Will you tell me what actually happened?
[30:59] Mom, uncle allowed sister Hadia in front of you to make changes in the house. Right?
[31:05] Yes then?
[31:06] So sister Hadia was changing the plants. She wanted flowers. Sheena came and said no. Saying no is okay.
[31:16] But so much insult. She insulted her in front of everyone and took me under fire as well.
[31:26] She told me you're a guest and stay like a guest. 
[31:30] She said she hated me being with Hadia all the time.
[31:33] So she's right. Why do you have to tag with her all the time?
[31:38] When she's saying so, stay away.
[31:42] Mom you know how lonely she is. Neither Natasha, nor aunt gives her any company.
[31:48] And not even brother Faizan.
[31:50] That's not your problem dear. This is how this house is. Everybody is busy with their own work.
[31:57] When Sheena has told you not to talk to her. Be careful in the future.
[32:46] What is this? I will not take her. Talk to dad. 
[32:53] My trip will be spoilt. Its not going to happen. Talk to him.
[33:07] Its been 24 hours since Faizan left but he didn't even call once.
[33:17] He didn't even inform if he had reached safely.
[34:02] Hello Faizan? Have you reached?
[34:09] What are you doing? 
[34:11] I have my flight in a little while. I'll be flying to Malaysia and you're on the phone. Why?
[34:21] Faizi I want to spend my life with you.
We'll spend our lives as well. But right now lets dance.
[34:37] Faizi leave me. I'm okay here.
No. I'm not okay without you.
[35:06] Faizi what are you doing? We just came and you'll leave?
[35:11] I have a plane to catch. Connecting flight.
[35:15] I cannot be late. I just have this time.
[35:17] Faizi please. Just stay back a little.
[35:21] I wish I could but I cannot. 
[35:25] I'll be in trouble if I get late.
[35:28] This means you don't value me anymore.
[35:33] What are you talking about! I took such a big risk for you. 
[35:38] and you are saying that I don't value you. 
[35:40] If dad finds out, he'll disown me. I earned his trust with so much difficulty.
[35:46] I just want this meeting to be successful so that I can come here again and again. And dad trusts me more.
[35:57] Faizi, will we always live away from each other? 
[36:01] You in Pakistan and me in Dubai. How long will this go on?
[36:07] No. We'll be together. I have to go now. I'm getting late. Ramsha?
[36:23] Okay. I'll stay for a while but then you won't stop me. Promise?
[36:29] Promise?
[36:32]  I'll get more to drink. Do you want something?
[37:23] Oh no..
[37:32] Hadia called? Did you answer? 
[37:38] I'm asking you. Did you answer?
[37:42] Yes.
[37:42] Why?
Because I wanted to.
[37:47] You didn't wrong. This is wrong. You shouldn't have.
[37:52] Why? You didn't tell Hadia about me?
[37:56] Its not the problem. The problem is if she tells dad, everything will be ruined. The trust I earned. You just ruined it.
[38:09] Why?
[38:10] Oh come on Faizi. Does that girl hold more importance for your dad than you?
[38:16] If your father asks you something, just lie to him. 
[38:22] And if she asks you anything, just give her a shut up call. 
[38:26] She shouldn't have the worth to question you.
[38:30] I took such a big risk coming here, you have no idea
[38:35] and rather than being happy, you're spying on me. You've disappointed me Ramsha.
[38:41] Accept it that you saw Hadia's name and answered the call. Just don't lie to me.
[38:51] Say you're sorry.
[38:55] I'm sorry Faizi. 
[38:59] I'll not do it again. Lets forget it and enjoy please.
[39:05] You've ruined it. This will not happen again.
[39:09]  I made a mistake. I shouldn't have come.
Faizi, listen to me. Faizi?!!!
