[01:50] You came home late last night as well.
[01:52] So?
[01:54] You're asking me, but I'm compelled to answer you.
[01:59] You give Ramsha all your answers.
[02:05] I don't want to argue.
I'm not arguing.
[02:09] This is the grave reality of my life.
[02:14] And if you don't talk to me about this today, then it will be very late.
[02:19] Before everyone at home finds out, you'll have to explain your relationship to me with Ramsha.
[02:27] The way she followed you to Islamabad and you meeting her, saying that it was a business meeting. What was all that?
[02:33] I know who is putting this nonsense in your head.
[02:40] Whoever it is... they have always wanted to the best for us.
[02:48] Aren't you defending him quite a lot.
Enough.
[02:53] If you say anything uncivil again, it won't be good.
[02:58] What do you think about what you've been doing? Father should know about what you're doing.
[03:02] Alright. Go and tell father about Ramsha. But let me tell you this, I won't stay silent.
[03:10] I will tell him about Razi. So let it be...
[03:19] Don't come in front of me.
[03:23] When you do, your betrayal comes in front of me as well.
[03:30] We've both made mistakes, then why should I be the only one who is punished?
[03:36] You should be punished as well. What about your punishment? What about your mistakes?
[03:51] You want to tell father... go ahead.
[03:57] But you'll have to face the consequences as well, remember that.
[04:43] Sure alright, I'm leaving for the airport. Whatsapp me the details of the meeting.
[04:50] When will you be back?
[04:53] As soon as the meeting is over. It will take a few days
[04:57] Take me as well. I would have had an outing as well
What will you do over there?
[05:03] Hadia is about to become a mother. Being her mother-in-law, you have some responsibility.
[05:09] A mother-in-law is a second mother.
[05:13] Keep me away from this responsibility. There are servants to take care of her.
I knew you would say that.
[05:20] That's why I've asked sister to take care of her. Farewell.
[05:43] Faizan...
[05:45] Where are you going so angrily?
Office.
[05:48] Why the office?
You should go to university.
[05:52] You've taken so many days off, you should go to the university today.
[05:56] I've left the university. I'll give the papers privately.
[06:00] What do you mean you left university? Why?
[06:07] I'll go to the office from now on.
[06:10] To keep an eye on Razi.
[06:14] He's not just deceiving father, he's deceiving everyone. I'll make sure he's ousted not only from the office, but from this house as well.
[06:34] Alright fine, don't worry. 
[06:38] I'll find everything about Ramsha and tell you.
[06:42] I'll tell everything to uncle and make him aware of the truth.
[06:47] No, you won't say anything to anyone. Especially to father...
[06:53] Otherwise...
[06:55] Otherwise, what?
[06:59] Hadia, what are you afraid of?
[07:03] You don't know how angry Faizan is... if her expose his affair with Ramsha, then he would defame us.
[07:10] I can tolerate anything, but not a stain on my reputation.
[07:17] In this society, nothing is said to the man..
[07:21] But a woman's life is made hell.
[07:26] And I don't want to give my parents pain in their old age. Fizza is on her way to getting married...
[07:34] And I...
[07:39] I'm about to become a mother.
[07:44] I can't take such a high risk.
[07:49] You will say nothing to no one. This is what's the better for the two of us.
[07:54] Understand?
[08:42] Mr. Faizan, how are you? Mr. Safdar has left for Islamabad, but you must know that.
[08:49] Where's Razi?
He's in his room.
[09:03] You?
[09:11] Did you find the time to come to work?
[09:14] This is my father's office.
[09:17] Whether I come or not, no one can ask me anything. Especially you.
[09:35] What are you prideful of?
[09:41] Thank God that I'm not opening my mouth.
[09:46] About your affair with Ramsha, and how you used university as an excuse to steal money and have a good time with her.
[09:55] Think about it. What if I tell everyone about that?
[10:00] What if I tell you that you were having an affair with my wife.
[10:05] Shut up!
[10:08] If you say something so vile again...
[10:12] then I won't be able to restrain myself.
[10:18] Who are you?
[10:23] Don't restrain yourself. Tell my father that I'm having affairs.
[10:31] If you think your threats will silence me, then you are wrong.
[10:37] No.
[10:39] Don't think this is a threat.
[10:49] If you think you've become a hero bringing Natasha home, I can end that in a moment.
[10:57] It's your misunderstanding that my father likes and trusts you more than me. I am his son!
[11:08] I'm his son. And who are you?
[11:11] You are a salaried employee. Your family is feeding of our scraps!
Don't talk about my family!
[11:19] Don't go there.
[11:22] If I respect your mother and sister, then you should respect my mother and sister as well!
[11:33] Don't forget that she's not only my mother..
[11:38] she's you aunt as well.
[12:01] I'm warning you for the last time.
[12:05] Stay away from my business.
[12:08] Otherwise I will embarrass you so much in front of father that you can't even fathom it.
[12:18] Do whatever you want Faizan...
[12:21] I will not be bothered by you threats. I will do what I think is right.
[12:34] The basis on which you're so confident, if I open up my mouth, think what will happen to her.
[12:42] Think long and hard before doing anything.
[12:49] Be very mindful of it.
[12:57] Leave.
[13:38] This month you only gave me five lacs.
[13:43] Sir, I wasn't able to manage this much, this month. It's hard for me to do anything by hiding it from Mr. Safdar.
[13:51] Sir, he's been checking everything diligently nowadays. If he finds out I can lose my job.
[14:00] You're acting like a victim. You said yes to this because you could do it. It's not like father started checking up on things just now.
[14:14] I need ten lacs every month and you will get your commission as well.
[14:21] Go.
[14:25] Sure sir.
[15:10] You're sitting outside here?
[15:16] What is the matter Natasha?
[15:19] You've seemed lost nowadays. You're sitting here alone and smiling.
[15:27] What is the matter? What are you thinking about?
[15:31] Nothing mother. Look how good the weather is.
[15:37] Natasha, I'm your mother and I know you very well.
[15:45] You're thinking about...
[15:51] someone else. 
[15:58] Are you insane?
[16:00] Look, don't do anything foolish. I will not tolerate a stupid decision like that.
[16:08] If Safdar finds out, he will oust me, alongside you.
[16:15] Mother, don't worry. Nothing will happen.
[16:25] Who is he, by the way?
[16:34] Razi...
[16:39] Are you insane Natasha?
[17:52] You're back my dear.
[17:56] What is the matter? Why are you in a bad mood?
[18:00] I'm asking you something. Why are you angry? Why aren't you saying anything?
[18:07] I think we should leave this place.
[18:11] Did you have a fight with Faizan?
No.
[18:16] I had no fights.
Will I not find out...
[18:19] if you lie?
[18:32] Mother, tell me one thing. If someone were to tell you...
[18:38] put false allegations on me, in the future, will you believe it?
[18:46] Not at all.
[18:49] Because I know my son very well.
[18:53] Meaning you trust me.
[18:57] Yes... I trust my son.
[19:04] Thank you.
[19:10] Wash up and change...
[19:14] I'll serve dinner until then.
Okay.
[19:23] Something happened.
[19:26] I don't know what he's hiding from me.
[19:36] You rejected him, or did you forget?
[19:40] I remember.
[19:44] If you remember then don't forget that I won't accept Razi, or his mother.
Mother...
[19:51] auntie is not like how she once was, her status is changed.
She'll lose her status, if Razi loses his job.
[20:01] Why would he lose his job? He has handled father's business splendidly.
[20:09] That's the problem. If Razi wasn't involved with Safdar, I would have ousted them from this house, a long time ago.
[20:17] Natasha, you've fallen head over heels for Razi ever since he saved you from Sherry.
[20:23] For God' sake this is reality, this is life! This is not a film!
[20:29] Don't forget that you were like this for Sherry as well.
But you cannot deny that he saved your daughter from that vile man.
[20:38] What if he hadn't come there that day? What would have happened?
[20:42] You're right, this is not a movie, this is a reality. This happened.
[20:47] Look, no matter what, I will not accept Razi..
[20:51] nor will I make Safdar's sister my sister-in-law, understand?
You said the same thing for Hadia's parents as well.
[21:01] Mother, it's not important what I used to think about Razi...
[21:06] what's important is what I think of him now.
[21:10] And... what is the problem with this? Father likes Razi as well.
[21:15] Natasha, seriously I think you've lost your mind.
[21:19] You've just came back from living with Sherry.
[21:23] And... this is what you're doing.
[21:26] Don't forget that you were head over heels like this for Sherry as well.
[21:38] These kids will drive me crazy.
[22:45] Hello Hadir, how are you?
[22:48] Thank God, you tell me.
I'm sorry I'm calling you after a long time.
[22:53] It's alright. What is it?
[22:54] I have something for you.
Sure, what is it?
[22:57] If I had to remove any data from someone's phone, how should I do that.
It's so simple, first ask for their phone...
[23:08] and then when they give it to you, delete the data you want to delete.
[23:13] I'm serious.
[23:17] Alright don't worry. You want to delete someone's data...
[23:23] I have an idea.
[23:25] We can have their phone hacked.
No, no hacking.
[23:31] Give me some other idea.
Another idea...
[23:37] Yes..
[23:40] If you're not short on cash...
[23:45] If they don't need their phone that much...
[23:50] then let's steal their phone.
[24:25] Faizan has no place in his heart for me.
[24:32] What if he tells everyone?
[24:37] What will happen then?
[24:40] What will happen of that innocent soul?
[24:47] No... that can't happen.
[24:50] I'll have to stop Faizan at any cost.
[24:54] But how? God please help me.
[25:17] It was right of you to threaten her, but don't do anything more than that.
[25:22] It's a matter of her respect.
I don't care.
[25:24] It would be a disaster.
[25:30] Just think about it.
[25:34] Are these bikes following us?
[25:42] You think so?
[25:53] I don't have a mobile.
Show me your mobile!
[25:57] Give it to me!
I don't have anything!
[26:04] They took away my phone!
[26:08] What the hell! They took my phone!
[26:14] Listen... it had those videos, they took away my phone!
Calm down!
[26:22] He had a gun! Is your phone more important or your life?
[26:28] You don't understand. That phone had that video! Where are the keys!
[26:37] Here is your possession.
[26:42] Thank you.
[26:45] You don't know what a huge favor you've done for me.
[26:50] It's alright. A friend like you can have my life as well. But what I don't understand is...
[26:57] why did you do this? What I mean to say is...
[27:02] Why did you need Faizan's phone?
That is a secret.
[27:06] I can't tell you right now. But I promise that I will tell you everything at the right time. Thank you.
[27:14] It's alright. We'll meet soon.
[27:18] Farewell*
[27:21] Thank you...
Yes, greet auntie for me.
[27:26] Greetings to you too.
[27:29] Farewell.
[27:53] Faizan..
[28:06] Faizan, are you okay?
[28:10] What happened to you?
[28:21] Faizan, tell me, is everything alright?
Yes it is.
[28:27] You don't seem fine to me...
[28:32] I've made you favorite dish today. It will cheer you up
[28:44] Do you really love me?
[28:48] You doubt my love?
[28:57] Faizan, if you think I married you because I was impressed by your status...
[29:03] then look at me. I'm living in a small flat.
[29:09] I'm Safdar Kamal's daughter-in-law and Faizan Kamal's wife...
[29:14] but look at my state. Have I ever complained or demanded anything from you.
[29:22] Have I asked you to buy me a mansion, like the one Hadia is living in?
[29:28] No Faizan, I don't want anything from you.
[29:34] Still you doubt my love?
[29:41] Your father doesn't like me at all. What can't he do to remove me from you life.
[29:52] Still, I took such a big risk.
[29:56] Only for you Faizan...
[30:00] Is this not proof of my love?
[30:12] I am sorry...
[30:18] I never understood your love.
[30:24] But promise me one thing...
[30:28] You will never betray me.
[30:31] Please, promise...
[30:36] I promise.
[30:41] Faizan, did Hadia...
[30:46] No... it's nothing like that.
[30:54] Faizan, look me in the eyes.
[30:57] You're hiding something for me.
[31:06] I'm hiding nothing.
[31:09] That is the truth.
[31:14] Sit down, I'll bring lunch for you.
[31:18] Sure.
[32:03] How can I be so stupid? How can I be so stupid!
[32:10] There is no back up of that video. I don't know what I will do now.
[32:17] I'll have to do something, because I can't tolerate Razi anymore.
[32:41] What happened? Did Faizan leave?
[32:45] Yes mother.
He looked worried to me today.
[32:50] He is worried, and the reason for that is Hadia.
[32:55] Hadia? Why would he be worried because of Hadia? He was very happy with her.
[33:01] He was in Murree and Islamabad because of her.
[33:04] He was happy, but not now. I felt it.
[33:09] He's started hating Haida, and that is good for me.
[33:16] Because as far as he goes away from Hadia, the closer he'll get to me.
[33:21] Hadia... Hadia... Hadia... hearing her name make my ears hurt.
[33:28] What happened that turned Faizan's heart bad towards Hadia?
[33:32] Don't worry. I will find out what Hadia did..
[33:39] that made Faizan so upset at her.
Remember one thing...
[33:44] don't back off your objective. Achieve your objective.
[33:53] You understand me, right?
[33:56] Make me a cup of tea.
[33:59] Sure.
[34:03] Greetings. Yes, I'm fine. How are you and father?
You don't sound fine to me...
[34:12] Why are you saying that?
[34:14] That day when me and your father visited you when you came back from Murree.
[34:19] You didn't seem fine to me. You seem diminished to me.
[34:25] I told you that I was unwell and we came from the hospital that day.
I know.
[34:32] You told me, but I don't believe it.
[34:36] You didn't seem happy, even though you were expecting.
[34:43] You look diminished. My dear...
[34:48] I'm your mother.
[34:50] Tell me.
[34:53] It's alright, believe, trust me.
Hadia...
[35:00] Are you crying?
[35:05] I got emotional seeing how happy you were.
[35:15] Tell me...
[35:18] How's Fizza, when is she coming to Karachi?
[35:21] She's fine, she's in Karachi. She was asking about you.
[35:26] Really... tell her to take a week off. I have lots to talk to her about.
[35:32] She was saying that she'll visit you when you come back.
[35:41] Hello? Hello?
[35:59] Who were you talking to?
[36:02] I was speaking to my mother. She was asking about my health.
[36:07] I didn't ask what you were talking about. Do you know who explain themselves? People who are doing something wrong.
[36:18] I am doing nothing wrong.
[36:22] If you are so suspicious, here check it out.
[36:28] Why would I check your phone? You could have saved Razi's number under your mother's name.
[36:35] Who knows, you might have deleted it before I came here. He could be calling you from a different number.
[36:41] You are a liar, that's why you're giving me your phone so confidently.
[36:49] Hadia, change your old ways, at least do it now. Who know this baby...
Enough Faizan!
[36:58] I will no hear one more word after this. Tell whomever you want. I fear no one.
[37:07] Before alleging me, take a good look at yourself.
[37:11] You are giving my love and right to Ramsha...
[37:16] Is loyalty only imposed upon a wife?
[37:22] Should a man not comply to it?
[37:27] After marrying you, I didn't even think about anyone besides you.
[37:32] And you have fallen so low that you are alleging me vile accusations!
[37:39] Go and tell everyone. Then I'll tell everyone what you've been doing.
[37:49] Go!
