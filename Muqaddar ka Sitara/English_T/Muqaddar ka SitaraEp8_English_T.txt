[02:36] The groom is so handsome.
Even the bride is so gorgeous.
[02:40] Yes, they have a beautiful couple.
[05:51] Please smile.
[06:50] Alright, whoever wants to start off with the festivities should come on the stage. 
[06:54] Natasha please you start.
[07:28] Give sweets to your brother.
[07:30] Faizan, now you'll not be spared. Eat. Come on eat.
[07:41] Alright, sorry. Last time. Sorry. Last time.
[07:53] Now come here.
Whats wrong with you? I told you I didn't like all this.
[08:02] Whatever man!
[08:15] What is all this? I'm really not in the mood. I'm doing it all because of uncle.
[08:22] Please be quiet. Whats wrong? What can we do? 
[08:26] See, I also dressed up for your uncle's happiness.
[08:31] Just fix your mood. He shouldn't feel anything. Understood what I'm saying.
[08:38] Oh, you're here. Whats wrong with you? 
[08:44] Please look after the guests and where is Razi?
[08:47] Dear go and receive Mr. Hamdani. I have to look after everything myself.
Razi was right here.
[08:55] He isn't feeling well so he might have gone to get medicine.
[08:58] What happened? He could have asked the driver.
[09:01] Why did he have to go himself? You know I have under so much pressure today. 
[09:05] And why do you have the long face?
Uncle...
[09:08] What uncle? Please go and receive the guests. I'll go and receive Mr. Hamdani.
[09:13] yes we are going
Come on be quiet.
[09:49] Enough. Are you done with everything? Are you at peace? Can I go now?
[10:05] Let the event be over?
What? 
[10:09] You promised that you'd not let all this foolishness happen with me. 
[10:12] You didn't listen to me. Why should I listen to you?
[10:16] Faizan?
[12:16] Fizza I feel anxious. I feel something terrible is about to happen.
[13:20] Come on. We're done with the Mehendi event peacefully. Safdar arranged everything well.
[13:30] Did you see the food? There was ample for everyone. I ate my fill.
[13:38] Oh yes, he was insisting we stay there because it was late but I didn't find it appropriate to stay at my daughter's in laws' house.
[13:51] And then he said he'd get us a hotel booking but I didn't agree. He has a big heart.
[14:00] He didn't hold back from arranging the best event.
[14:11] Because we agreed to whatever they said. They will now take care of us.
[14:17] Its not that now. 
[14:20] His son in one in a million and he has ample girls around him.
[14:27] Now its something else that they liked Hadia. That's our good fortune.
Good fortune?
[14:39] What is fortunate about this? Did you see Faizan's attitude?
[14:46] And his wife and sister? They didn't even look at us forgetfully.
[14:53] We are his son's in laws.
[14:56] What difference does it make? We have nothing to do with them. Unless Faizan himself..
[15:02] Faizan? 
Hadia's dad.. we've already seen Faizan being so ill mannered.
[15:13] I'm amazed that you cannot see them.
[15:18] I'm amazed Khadijah that you're after one thing only.
[15:25] Come on, he's their only son. He comes from a rich family and has been brought up in America. 
[15:32] Its only been a little while that they came here.
[15:37] He will take time to learn the ways of our society and our Hadia will assist him in this.
[15:46] And as far as Sheena and her daughter are concerned, all mother and sister in laws are like this.
[15:58] Tell me the truth, had you found a match for your daughter here in Hyderabad,
[16:04]  wouldn't you fear the same for your daughter from her mother or sister in law?
[16:18] Faizan will get better. Don't worry. 
[16:24] As it is, what do you think, would I get my daughter married in a house where she'd be unhappy?
[16:40] I hope it is so.
[17:16] Please eat something.
Get me some poison.
[17:30] Why are you saying this?
You knew Fizza? Tell me the truth, did you know?
[17:36] Had I known, I would have told you. Why would I hide?
How can it be? Such a big deception.
[17:43] It was a deception. We misunderstood.
[17:46] Did he tell you he came from America or that he was Safdar uncle's son or that his name was Faizan?
[17:51] See, he didn't say anything.
But mom and dad..
[17:56] Why would they lie to you?
But then did Safdar uncle lie?
[18:00] No. Nobody lied. They didn't show as if they lied or hid something.
[18:08] And even mom dad didn't even feel as if they're meeting Faizan for the first time.
[18:11] Then who was the guy who came to our house and expressed his interest in me?
[18:18] He was Razi. He is Safdar uncle's nephew.
[18:22] Why didn't he tell me who he was? Why didn't he tell me his name?
What do I know?
[18:27] He came to our house. He called me so many times. 
[18:30] He said he would send his mother, but why didn't he?
[18:34] And why didn't he tell Safdar uncle that he liked me?
Can you tell mom?
[18:43] He's a man. He can tell.
[18:50] He didn't do good. 
[18:53] Why did this happen with me Fizza? I never hurt anyone. 
[18:58] If he wasn't written for me then why,
[19:02] why did he made me fall in love with him?
He was flirting with you.
[19:07] Had he loved you, he would have brought his family. 
[19:11] He lives with Safdar uncle. Wouldn't he know?
[19:15] Didn't he know that Safdar uncle was bringing a proposal for you from Faizan?
[19:20] That's why its useless to cry for such a man. Whats done is done.
[19:33] Have your breakfast. Hadia..
[20:15] Razi, come on, your uncle is calling for breakfast.
No mom. I'm not hungry.
[20:23] Why wouldn't you? You haven't eaten anything since last night. You'll get ill.
Let me fall ill.
[20:31] I'm not in the mood.
Brother, look at me.
[20:39] You didn't even sleep all night. You kept missing her.
[20:45] Razi, why are you punishing yourself? When you know Hadia cannot be yours.
[20:53] She now belongs to Faizan. Forget her now.
[20:58] Mom, I'm tired of making him understand this.
[21:03] She doesn't belong to you. Don't miss her now.
[21:05] I loved her with all my heart and if you love someone so much, you cannot forget them.
[21:12] You loved her truly but she, she made fun of your love.
[21:19] She hurt your feelings. Don't miss her so much.
[21:27] For God's sake Razi, my child. Try and understand.
[21:34] We cannot do anything that's why we're quiet.
[21:41] Please go. I'll eat later. Please leave me alone right now.
[21:54] Please.
[22:48] How did you like the function last night?
[22:51] It was amazing. More than we expected. Otherwise something or the other usually happens at weddings.
[23:02] You just need to have money and it solves everything. Nothing stays amiss, nothing goes wrong.
[23:08] Didn't you see, Faizan's in laws didn't object to anything.
[23:14] Hmm. Dear, Farwa, did you enjoy?
Yes uncle. I enjoyed a lot.
[23:23] Thank God. You'll see how I get Razi married like this with all the pomp and then you and Natasha.
[23:34] Sure.
Where are Faizan and Razi both? I haven't seen them.
[23:40] Razi hasn't been feeling well since last night. He said he would be late for work as well.
[23:49] Oh my God, whats wrong with you? Faizan..
[23:55] Are you okay?
No. I'm not okay. Its because of all of you.
[24:00] I did tell you that don't put henna on me but you didn't even listen to me. 
[24:03] You have no sense to organize a function.
[24:06] This keeps happening in wedding and all these events are important as well.
[24:11] Nothing happens. All this is nonsense and nothing else.
[24:15] Language. She is your aunt Faizan.
I'm sorry dad but Faizan is absolutely right.
[24:22] But yesterday, the bride's family misbehaved. Faizan tolerated everything. 
[24:28] Had it been me, I would have broken someone's hand or feet.
[24:35] I'm telling you clearly, if something similar happens to be during the wedding, I'll not tolerate it and I'll walk out.
[24:41] Have breakfast at least.
Excuse me.
[24:47] Yes, Hadia's family crossed all limits yesterday.
[24:55] When has a groom fallen sick like this?
[25:01] He just has an allergy. Can you recommend some medicine? Oh I just remembered,
[25:09] you made a herbal tea.
I'll make it. He'll be fine in an hour.
[25:18] Yes, please make that for him.
Let it be, I'll give him medicine.
[25:22] Alright. I'll just leave. Ask Razi to freshen up and join me in the office.
Okay.
[25:30] You should also ask Faizan to seriously take the business and meet me in the office.
[25:39]  He is now getting married. Alright. Bye.
[25:53] By the way mom, did you know, Christianity doesn't have these useless traditions. They have simple weddings.
[26:03] Yes, we have these useless, outdated traditions. What can I say?
[26:30] Enough, how much will you cry?
Maybe all my life.
[26:41] God forbid. Don't say like this. 
[26:44] You'll always be happy, if God wills.
How will I be happy Fizza?
[26:49] How will be I happy with a man who I don't love? The man I don't know. 
[26:57] I cannot tell you whats going on in my heart.
[27:05] I am marrying someone else, while I love someone else.
[27:10] Please don't be so loud. If mom hears us, it'll be chaotic.
[27:13] What about what is going on in my heart? Nobody cares about that.
Its very late.
[27:20] Accept brother Faizan as your fate.
[27:28] So easily?
What else can you do?
[27:32] I'll talk to mom and dad. I cannot get married.
[27:39] sister!
[27:51] Mom. What are you doing?
You're saying no to this wedding?
[27:58] Why? What happened in a day that you're saying no now?
[28:08] You were against me saying no until yesterday. What happened now?
[28:20] Mom.. its not that..
If its not that then are my ears deceiving me? Am I lying?
[28:30] I kept saying no to your father, only to avoid embarrassment but you..
[28:37] now you're saying no to the wedding one day before the wedding.
[28:41]  Wow Hadia. How did you get so brave?
[28:47] Who made you so brave? 
[28:51] When I was saying no, when I was against this wedding,
[28:56] you were unhappy. Why? Why were you unhappy if you had someone else in your heart?
[29:09] I was quiet because I was worried for your future. 
[29:14] Had you told me then, I would have said no. What do you think?
[29:21] Am I happy for this wedding? No. I'm not happy dear.
[29:31] But I cannot do anything. I cannot.
[29:35] Its all your fault. You liked someone else and said yes. So now you'll have to get married.
[29:48] I'll die mom..
You should die.
[29:56] Mom.. Mom..
[30:38] You're here and I'm looking for you in the whole house.
[30:41] I had a headache so I came here for some peace.
[30:48] If you're unwell, should I take you to the doctor.
No. Its alright.
[30:54] Actually, Faizi's wedding has created a lot of chaos and dad has brought aunt and her family. We don't get a moment of peace now.
[31:05] You're right. Our privacy has been disturbed. Earlier I could talk to Safdar but now I have to careful. What if she hears,
[31:19] or if she dislikes something.
I don't understand when will they leave?
[31:27] I think they'll be here all our life now. 
[31:31] Now get ready. Lets go to the salon. I've booked an appointment for you and myself.
[31:36] For what?
[31:39] I think you've forgotten, its Faizan's wedding.
[31:43] No please. I'm not well today.
[31:49] Can we go some other time? On the wedding day please.
Come on lets go.
[31:55] Please mom. Call them at home today. We'll have services at home.
Alright, I'll call them to come home.
[32:28] Enough Razi. 
[32:31] Dear, what have you done to yourself?
[32:34]  How long will you stay like this? Safdar has asked for you about fifty times.
[32:39] This isn't a good thing. There are thousands of things to do. He needs you and here you are, suffering.
[32:50] Come on get up and fix yourself. Eat breakfast and go to work.
Do you think this is all a drama?
[32:59] No dear. I don't think that.
Then why are you taking my feelings for granted?
[33:06] Its not that but I object to your condition. Why are you suffering like a lost lover? You'll make others suspicious.
[33:18] See dear, life is beautiful. Will you sacrifice it for a disloyal girl?
Mom, she isn't disloyal.
[33:26] Alright, she might not be but you cannot destroy your life for someone like this.
[33:37] Come dear, I've ironed your clothes. Go to office.
Why did she do this mom?
[33:45] What did I lack that she said yes for Faizan and not me.
[33:51] No dear. You don't lack anything but when girls see a lot of opportunities, they do what Hadia did.
[34:06] But its not her fault as well. Faizan's proposal was very attractive.
What do you mean?
[34:18] Whatever Hadia decided was right.
No dear. I am not saying that but she'll regret one day.
[34:29] Its just you should have a bigger heart and accept that she's marrying someone else and you have no connection to her.
No mom.
[34:43] The fire inside me. I'm burning inside.
[34:50] Leave me alone mom.
Alright. Do whatever you want to do.
[35:16] You hid this from me.
Mom we found out ourselves last night.
[35:22] Safdar uncle brought him along every time and we thought he was his son. 
[35:27] Hadia was happy because Safdar uncle brought the proposal.
[35:31] Even you people didn't mention that boy and we thought he was Safdar uncle's son.
[35:38] So Hadia likes Razi?
[35:42] Its good that our girls liked the boy who came in our house. Is that how we brought you up?
[35:47] No mom. please don't say this
[35:50] You know how many eligible students dad have. Hadia was never interested in anyone. Razi was different.
[36:01] He expressed his love to Hadia and she was impressed by his honesty. 
[36:08] She was happy because Safdar uncle brought a proposal.
[36:12] But mom, trust me, Razi is a very nice boy.
I agree Razi is a very good boy.
[36:21] But he shouldn't have just expressed his love. He should have sent his mom. 
[36:25] He declared his love and sat at home. This is not how gentlemen are.
[36:31] Mom this is where everything went home. Razi didn't mention to his family and Safdar uncle brought a proposal for his son.
[36:40] At least you could have told me.
[36:43] What should I do now? The arrow has left the bow. 
[36:47] Ask Hadia to focus on the boy she's getting married to.
[36:52] It doesn't suit respectable girls to keep their old flames in the heart.
But mom..
[36:59] Can nothing be done now?
[37:01] What will I do now Fizza? She is getting married in front of a hundred people tomorrow.
[37:09] What should we say no for? Do we have a basis? 
[37:12] And listen to me. I'm warning you against doing anything wrong.
[37:18] Our house has no space for all this.
[37:21] Mom, I will always tell you if I like someone.
