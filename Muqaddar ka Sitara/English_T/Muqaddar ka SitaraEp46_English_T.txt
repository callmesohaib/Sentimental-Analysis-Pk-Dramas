[00:54] Father, what happened?
[01:00] Brother Aleem, tell me something.
[01:07] What happened, is everything alright?
[01:18] Everything is over.
What?
[01:22] Everything is...
What are you saying? Control yourself.
[01:29] Bring water Farwa. Hurry up!
[01:52] Mom... dad, Fizza is not that type of girl. All of those pictures are lies, I don't believe them.
[01:58] But my dear, it isn't a good thing for someone to talk about a girl like that.
[02:04] What could that mean?
Whatever it may be, one shouldn't break relationships like that.
[02:09] This is how relationships are made and ended.
[02:12] Honor and respect matter a lot.
Father, you're right.
[02:18] Did you look at the picture, is Fizza smiling in any one of them? They are edited.
[02:24] Even then my heart is not content.
[02:27] If someone is doing that to her on purpose, then he has a reason behind it.
[02:32] I'm sure that something has been hidden from us. If he intended to break off this relationship and we don't do it...
[02:39] then think what he'll do with us.
Yes, he's right.
[02:44] My dear, think of how much we'll be defamed in our extended family. How long will you tolerate it?
[02:50] Mother, let me talk to Fizza about this, just once.
You wouldn't have achieved anything by doing that.
[02:55] I will still say that you guys were hasty in ending the relationship.
[03:02] Son...
[03:07] Alright, sit down. I'll talk to him.
[03:12] Uncle has a misunderstanding. Fizza is not like that.
How much more will you lie for your sister?
[03:19] Safdar and I saw her with a guy last night. She was with him by the gate.
[03:26] Tell me Fizza, am I lying?
[03:36] Silence yourself, Shina.
[03:39] What will my silence achieve? Brother Aleem should know...
[03:43] that his daughter, even though she's engaged, meets up with a guy.
[03:50] You know it, brother Rehman knows this as well. We've seen it as well.
[03:58] And one can't deny this labeling the truth as a misunderstanding.
[04:04] Whatever it may be, you have no business saying anything about this.
[04:08] It might be a personal matter, but since it is happening in my home, I can't stay silent.
[04:14] If I don't say anything today, she'll meet that guy again.
You are alleging my daughter.
[04:20] She's not like this. Say something my dear, tell me that she's lying.
[04:31] Tell me... am I lying?
[04:37] Enough sister, silence. Let me talk to my daughter. Tell me, dear, what happened?
[04:45] She is alleging us and humiliating us. Please say something.
[04:50] Mother... I've been wanting...
Don't try to make false stories to prove yourself innocent.
[04:59] Auntie, why are you coloring this the wrong way? It's not like this, you guys have a misunderstanding.
[05:09] Tell everyone the truth about everything. I'm with you... I believe you. Tell everyone about what happened.
[05:25] Fizza... don't test my patience. What is this that everyone knows, but we won't?
[05:35] What is this that your in-laws know which is making them end this relationship?
[05:44] They are not thinking of it, they have ended it. Maybe you didn't hear brother Aleem properly.
[05:58] I'm warning you one last time. This is their matter.
[06:03] What difference does it make? They found that relationship on our reference. What face will we have left in front of brother Rehman?
[06:21] Mother... that guy is my class fellow and for many days...
[06:44] Auntie, please.
[06:45] Let her speak, she wants to say something.
[06:49] What else is there left to be heard? She just said that he's her class fellow
[06:55] Auntie, please silence yourself.
[07:00] Auntie please... she's trying to say something. How can you decide anything without hearing her? At least listen to her.
[07:09] How can you guys hold her responsible without hearing her?
[07:15] Why are you interested in her matter? Why are you becoming her lawyer?
[07:24] Oh really! I'm becoming her lawyer under the same circumstances I became Natasha's lawyer.
[07:59] Don't worry brother Aleem.
[08:03] In all of this matter, I don't think Fizza is at fault. The only thing is that...
[08:12] she kept us unaware of this matter.
[08:25] Uncle, it is possible that Fizza was trying to solve this matter on her own.
[08:32] And maybe she couldn't do that.
[08:37] No matter who this guy is, he is vile.
[08:43] He doesn't care for anyone's respect.
[08:49] Uncle please, be strong.
[08:53] Uncle, please ask Fizza to send me that guy's number.
[08:59] Wherever he is, I'll teach him a lesson.
[09:03] No son... there is no point in doing that.
[09:09] He has done what he set out to do. He broke off my daughter's engagement.
[09:19] My head has fallen in shame in front of you all.
[09:23] What are you saying? You are like my elder brother. You're a part of this family.
[09:33] Brother Rehman should have asked before breaking the engagement. I will talk to him.
[09:44] No... Safdar, there is no need for you to talk to him about this.
[09:53] He did what he thought was right.
[09:58] And I am a father to a daughter...
[10:03] I cannot spread my hands in front of someone for my daughter's honor.
[10:13] But brother Aleem...
I have no complaints against anyone.
[10:18] My honor doesn't allow me...
[10:24] to question someone for Fizza.
[10:30] They are right in their way. After all, they have to stand before their extended family and answer for it.
[10:49] He is right.
[10:56] He should have called you before ending this relationship.
[11:00] What if learns tomorrow that Fizza had no fault in this, will he come back to rejoin the relationship?
[11:09] That can't be... one can't make or break off a relationship whenever one wants to. This is not child's play.
[11:19] You're right.
[11:47] Sister Khadija, I thought that your daughters were innocent, but they proved me wrong.
[11:57] What do you mean daughters?
[12:01] Besides, Fizza's matter has been cleared. It's not her fault.
[12:07] That is Fizza's part of the story, we haven't heard the other side.
Call the guy then.
[12:14] We can hear his story as well.
Why would I get into this matter? I don't know that guy.
[12:26] I've seen how much you care about this matter today.
Mother, Fizza told me about this a while ago.
[12:34] I was the one who stopped her from telling you and father.
[12:43] I knew that you guys would get worried. She was was so happy when she got admission to a medical university.
[12:50] If you would have called her back, would that not have ruined her career? She didn't complain about that guy because she didn't want to ruin his career.
[12:59] But he was not worthy of that. If I knew he could stoop so low, I would have told you about him a long time ago.
[13:20] Fizza, give me that guy's number.
[13:30] If I don't have that guy expelled from university then my name isn't Razi.
[13:39] Why are you trying to be a hero? Her engagement is broken.
[13:50] Fizza, if you didn't want to tell your parents, you could have told Razi.
[13:57] He likes solving such matters, ask your sister about that. He would have been very happy to solve your issue.
[14:11] You don't need to ask Hadia, you can ask Natasha how I saved her from that man.
[14:21] That man Sherry, who she was stuck with after she married him in secret.
[14:27] He was stealing from her. You can try mentioning that as well.
[14:39] Fizza... forward me his number.
[14:43] I'll sort him out.
[14:59] We should get going.
[15:03] Pack your stuff as well.
[15:07] Hadia is going nowhere, but you can take Fizza away.
[15:13] But I do want to go with my parents right now. They are worried and they need me.
[15:23] Alright...
[15:25] Fine, you can go. But no need to make excuses. I know how much you have your heart in this house.
[15:51] The doctor ordered some juice and I'll have it made for you.
[15:57] What happened to her?
[16:01] She's worried...
For what?
[16:04] For her sister.
[16:06] What did she do?
I'll tell you later. Tell me where you're coming from. Did you eat?
[16:14] I haven't. Have it served in five minutes?
Alright.
[16:19] Come on dear, gather your stuff, and let's go.
[16:25] We can't Hadia with us in her state, but we should get going.
[16:32] I was about to say that you guys can't take her away in this state so...
How's she feeling now?
[16:40] She's fine. The doctor said that her blood pressure came down.
[16:46] The doctor has ordered care.
[16:49] Take care of Hadia.
Will Safdar leave work to take care of her?
[16:55] It would be better if you would have asked me, or Faizan to do that.
[17:00] I've seen how much Faizan cares about her. He didn't even take a look at her.
[17:08] Since he's not happy, he doesn't care.
[17:15] Brother... after God I hand over my daughter to you.
[17:28] You asked for her hand with much love...
[17:33] Please stay on your word and promise.
[17:37] This is a mother's request.
[17:42] Why are you embarrassing me? Hadia is important to me more than my children
[17:48] I promise you that I will not let any pain come to her. As soon as she gets better I will bring her to Hyderabad.
[17:57] My dear... talk among yourselves. I'll come back later.
[18:07] Come on dear.
[18:11] Razi, what need is there for you to involve yourself in everyone's matters? Why don't you mind your business?
[18:20] How can you say that? This is uncle Aleem's family, they are not strangers.
[18:29] I don't remember that you've ever asked me not to help anyone. Then why today?
[18:35] Since when you have cared if someone is family or not?
Why are you not understanding me?
[18:42] Shina will make a mess of this situation. She will say that you're getting involved in this matter because Fizza is Hadia's sister.
[18:49] I don't care what she thinks. I helped Natasha as well, she wasn't Hadia's daughter.
[18:59] I don't care what aunt Shina thinks or plans...
[19:07] I can't change her thoughts. Tell me, mother, is Fizza such a girl?
[19:15] No, right? Then why are you stopping me from helping her?
[19:22] Auntie was wrong. She shouldn't have made a mess of this situation.
Her in-laws...
[19:30] have broken off the engagement, and you're saying that it wasn't a big issue.
[19:36] Mother, I'm a part of this house, how can I separate myself from this issue?
[19:43] I want to know who that man is and what his intention is... I want to teach him a lesson.
[19:50] Fizza has no brother. Who will help them if not me? Uncle Aleem is a simple man.
[19:57] He needs my help.
[20:06] God forbid if this had happened to Farwa...
[20:10] would you have stopped me then? No, right?
[20:16] Fizza and Farwa are my sisters. All sisters are the same.
[20:21] I don't care what auntie says and does. Do you think I'm doing this because of Hadia?
[20:32] My son... I don't want you getting in any mess.
[20:39] Lord knows who that man is, who's he working for... if God forbids he harms you...
[20:48] then I will die.
[20:57] Mother... nothing will happen to me.
[21:02] Your prayers are with me.
[21:04] Nothing like that will happen. Please...
[21:09] stop crying.
[21:13] You look good when you smile.
[23:43] My silence will not do anything. Brother Aleem should know...
[23:47] that his daughter meets a guy in the night, even though she has a fiance.
[24:10] We were impressed by you people. We thought your daughter was honorable, but things seem different now.
[24:22] You have deceived us by posing yourselves as honorable. But we are respectable people...
[24:27] We don't understand your hypocrisy.
[24:43] There is nothing bad about it. It's her life, let her enjoy and have fun.
[24:49] Razi was saying that those pictures were fake.
[24:55] How can he say that without taking a looking at them?
He's guessing they are.
[25:03] He's guessing... that's quite impressive.
[25:07] You know what, I think he's the one who took those pictures.
[25:12] Faizan, he's not like that.
He's not like that, nor is Fizza, or Hadia.
[25:19] We are the only ones who are at fault.
Both sisters flapped their wings after coming to Karachi.
[25:26] Did you take a look at Fizza? She was shining! Hadia might have gotten better living here with us...
[25:34] But Fizza...
[25:38] I've determined something about you... you have no control over your tongue.
[25:44] I will talk to you now. You...
[25:49] what are you doing here? You should be with Hadia right now. You find a few moments at home, that too you spend with your mother.
[25:58] Go and take care of her.
[26:07] My dear, you should go as well. I need to talk to your mother.
Sure.
[26:17] Now tell me, why did you talk in their matter?
[26:24] I don't understand you. Sometimes you defend them so much that you turn me into a stranger.
[26:32] How can I not speak about this? This was a huge matter!
I don't care about that. You had no business speaking.
[26:41] How is it not? You should remember that you saw Fizza with that guy at the gate of our house.
[26:49] How can you deny that?
Fizza forgot her assignment, and that guy came to return that.
[26:57] And Fizza told me everything. You made a mess of everything.
[27:02] I made a mess of things? Mr. Abdul Rehman broke off the engagement over something so trivial and you're saying that I made a mess of things.
[27:12] You were provoking things there. You were insulting brother Aleem and his wife.
[27:20] You were humiliating them. That guy was blackmailing Fizza...
[27:28] and you were torturing Fizza and her parents for no reason. You should have been standing by Fizza...
[27:36] Could you not have stayed silent like my sister?
The reason she stays silent is that her son participates for her.
[27:46] Why would I have remained silent? Fizza met that guy at the gate of my house,  who knows tomorrow he might come to her room
[27:55] I had no idea that both sisters could be so dishonorable. Enough!
[28:02] Not one more word about Fizza or Hadia?
Why should I not? Why do you want to put a veil over their deeds?
[28:10] I have no interest in putting a veil over their deeds. But I can be a witness to their character.
[28:16] They are honorable girls and their parents have raised the well.
[28:21] Brother Rehman was embarrassed by them, and you're saying that they are honorable.
[28:26] You were never embarrassed by what your children did.
[28:29] There is no point in having a moral high ground over other people's daughters.
[28:35] From now there is no need for you to speak in matters of Fizza and Hadia. If I catch you torturing them, then there will be none worse than me.
[31:31] No matter what anyone says. Whatever evidence they might present to me...
[31:39] I could never admit that my daughter could do something like this.
[31:45] Do you think I can?
[31:50] Both of our daughters grew up before our eyes. 
[31:57] I am aware of all of their colors.
[32:01] Where they went... what they did... I know everything.
[32:10] But... what happened was not good...
[32:16] Fizza should not have hidden this from us. If she had told us earlier...
[32:23] maybe we could have found a better solution for this.
[32:32] Maybe then sister Shina wouldn't have had the chance to humiliate us, or brother Rehman to break off the engagement.
[32:42] Brother Rehman turned out to be very impressionable... I could never have imagined...
[32:49] An educated man who lives in the city...
[32:55] he can't distinguish between right and wrong.
[33:05] I've lost all faith in him.
One shouldn't put their faith in anybody.
[33:14] God is the only one we can put our faith on.
[33:21] You're right.
[33:26] But... we should find out...
[33:31] why that man did this? What did he want from this?
[33:39] How will we find that out?
[33:43] We've already endured a loss.
[33:47] Should we stand by idly?
[33:53] Should we not prove that the allegation made against our daughter is wrong?
[34:00] If you ask me, I can talk to Razi. There is no need to talk to anyone.
[34:10] It's wrong to stay silent.
[34:14] That guy could harm Fizza again. After all, Fizza won't stay at home, she will return to her university.
[34:21] She will but tell Fizza...
[34:27] Father...
[34:33] Father, I'm prepared to testify over The Holy Quran.
[34:39] I don't know that man, I am not associated with him in any way.
[34:49] You don't need to testify over anything. I believe you.
[34:58] Both of you please forgive me. I beg you.
[35:03] Because of me you two were embarrassed and humiliated.
[35:08] My dear, you don't need to say anything. You don't need to explain yourself.
[35:17] I told you, I believe you. Whatever the people say...
[35:24] let them say it. I don't care about what they say.
[35:32] Father.
[35:35] Forgive me.
[35:49] Brother Aleem, I called you to apologize.
[35:55] I wanted to apologize for Shina's misbehavior.
You don't need to say anything, Safdar.
[36:03] But... after what happened yesterday...
[36:06] I think after that our relationship won't be as it was before.
[36:13] Why are you saying that... I extend my apologies to you.
[36:17] Safdar, my daughter is a part of me at your house. I request you...
[36:25] to take special care of her. Don't let any harm come to her.
Brother Aleem believe me...
[36:33] I will not let any harm come to Hadia. I promise you that.
[36:41] Farewell.
[37:02] Who were you talking to?
[37:06] No one...
I heard everything. What need was there to ask for forgiveness?
[37:11] Shina, this matter is between me and brother Aleem, better you stay away from it.
[37:16] You're forgetting that I have a relationship with him as well.
Oh really?
[37:22] Where was that, when you were ripping the honor of that relationship to shreds?
[37:28] Where was that then?
I have no guilt over what I did.
[37:34] That's what disappoints me. You didn't care for my old friendship with brother Aleem.
[37:41] Look at what their daughter did, how boldly she met that guy.
[37:46] Can a girl from an honorable family do that?
She was entrapped.
[37:52] She was entrapped.
How do you know that?
[37:57] That is my point of view and Razi thinks that as well.
[38:07] Why would anyone do that?
Whoever it is, I will find them.
[38:14] Anyways... do one thing. Some people are coming in the evening to look at Farwa...
[38:21] No need to worry. You don't need to do anything. I've talked to my sister, she'll look after the guests and the other arrangements as well.
[38:33] But please... don't do anything that will hurt me again.
[38:39] Please... it's a matter of a daughter.
