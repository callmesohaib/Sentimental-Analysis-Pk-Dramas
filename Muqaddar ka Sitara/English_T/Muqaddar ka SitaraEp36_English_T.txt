[01:20] Faizan...
[01:23] It's time for your medicine.
[01:47] I'll clean it up.
[01:54] I'll bring another shirt for you. I don't want you to catch a cold.
[02:05] Change.
[02:19] Iron this.
[02:35] Forget everything and return to life.
[02:43] There's nothing left in my life.
[02:48] Don't say such hopeless things. You're not alone.
[02:57] Sherry has been arrested today and instead of celebrating, you're being sad?
[03:09] I'm sad...
[03:13] because I believed a man like Sherry. I was unable to recognize the good people in life.
[03:23] I shouldn't have done what I did to you all.
[03:29] I didn't care for my father's name or the name of my extended family.
[03:38] I thought Razi was wrong, I doubted his intentions.
[03:46] But look how good he turned out to be.
[03:52] He saved me from there and asked father to forgive me.
[04:02] Do you know, he came to the apartment to make me understand...
[04:09] I abused him and ousted him.
[04:14] I was such a fool.
[04:19] When did he come there?
He came there a few days ago to make me understand.
[04:30] Mother, if he hadn't come to save me that day...
[04:35] then maybe I wouldn't be sitting here between you all. Sherry would have killed me.
[04:44] I'm only here because of Razi.
[04:51] Otherwise, I don't know what would have happened.
[05:13] Uncle, this is Natasha's jewelry, cellphone, and cash that the police retrieved from Sherry.
[05:26] You've fulfilled the promise that you made.
[05:31] I am grateful to you.
[05:36] It's alright...
[05:41] Uncle, I have a request...
[05:46] What is it?
[05:51] Please, forgive Natasha from all your heart. I feel...
[05:58] that she regrets what she did.
I will forgive her...
[06:07] but if ever again in life...
[06:10] she tries something like this, then I'll forget that she's my daughter.
[06:17] I will not only remove her from my inheritance, I will remove her from my life as well.
[06:26] That is your right, if...
[06:32] Uncle, the pain that Sherry caused Natasha...
[06:38] Believe me, she will never do anything like that again.
[06:45] Again I ask you and auntie to take care of her.
[06:57] Razi, that guy shouldn't get bailed out. He should be punished most rigorously.
[07:08] Don't worry uncle. He and his partners will be presented to the court tomorrow.
[07:15] I hope that the court will punish them strictly.
[07:23] That is how it should be. What's saddening is...
[07:31] that she spent so much time with such a man...
[07:37] I can't tolerate that.
[07:43] Digging at the past, one can only find sadness.
[07:51] One should forget it as soon as possible.
[07:57] If you forget that Natasha had some bad days...
[08:05] then I want to tell you...
[08:09] that soon Natasha will escape these memories.
[08:14] I pray to God that's true.
[08:41] Sir, the breakfast is ready and miss Hadia is waiting for you.
[08:50] Alright.
Yes sir.
[09:04] Ramsha, Faizan is not here.
Let me check.
[09:15] Greetings...
Where is Mr. Faizan?
[09:18] Who are you and where did you come from?
We're from Pindi and we've lost our way.
[09:22] Silence!
[09:24] Tell him that he has guests from Karachi.
Wait here, I'll tell him.
[09:32] I'm telling you that Faizan isn't here. It's a waste of time.
You don't know anything.
[09:39] Look at this beautiful place where Faizan is, with his wife Hadia.
[09:44] But he has locked me up in that small house. I won't let him get away with this.
[09:48] You won't let him get away with this?  He won't let me get away with this. I didn't tell him that I was bringing you here.
[09:53] Yes... if you would have told him, he wouldn't have let me come here. Don't worry, he won't say a word to you. I'll handle him.
[10:02] Come with me...
[10:08] Sir, there are some guests here to meet you.
Who?
[10:12] They are not telling me their name, but they are here from Karachi.
[10:15] If you want I can call them here.
No, I'll take care of it.
[10:23] Who can it be from Karachi?
[10:47] Hey buddy, what a pleasant surprise! When did you get here?
Just right now.
[10:53] How are you?
I'm fine and you?
[10:59] Faizi...
[11:10] How did you like the surprise?
[11:15] What are you doing? What is she doing here?
[11:20] Why?
[11:29] Where's Faizan?
[11:31] Miss, he's outside, he has some guests from Karachi.
Really?
[11:37] Ask him to bring the guest inside and arrange for some snacks with the tea.
Sure miss.
[12:01] Didn't you like me coming here?
I asked you not to do anything like this. Then, what is this?
[12:07] My husband is so sick and I'm here to ask how you're doing.
[12:13] I have as much right over you as Hadia. She has tended to you enough...
[12:21] Now I'm here, tell Hadia to leave for Karachi on the first flight back.
[12:26] Ramsha, that won't happen. Please don't create a scene in front of Hadia, otherwise, I'm warning you, I'll leave you.
[12:34] And you... why did you bring her here? Are you insane?
[12:37] I brought her here? She's the one who brought me here!
[12:41] Listen... I'll book a room for the two of you, I'll come and meet you. Okay?
[12:45] I won't go anywhere. I'm your wife and came here to see how you were doing.
[12:51] And you can't ask me to leave.
I'm forced to do this, try and understand.
[12:57] I'll book a room for you at the hotel. I'll meet you in the evening.
I'm not going anywhere.
[13:04] Enough... I've decided that I won't go anywhere. I'll stay where ever you stay.
[13:11] Please Ramsha, I can't talk right now...
[13:16] It will be a huge mess. Please go, I'll spend the entire day tomorrow with you.
[13:23] I don't trust your words anymore.
Faizan...
[13:58] Sultan told me that your friend was here.
[14:03] Will you keep them standing, or ask them to come inside?
I was about to ask them when you came.
[14:11] Introduce me to them.
This is my best friend...
[14:17] Zohaib.
Greetings*
[14:21] And this is Zohaib's wife...
[14:24] Sanam...
[14:29] Oh... greetings.
Hello.
[14:34] How are you?
I'm good
[14:36] They were nearby, so I asked them here.
[14:40] That's great that you did that. I haven't met any of Faizan's friends, that's why I'm happy that you're here.
[14:55] Come inside... come inside, Sanam.
Sure, why not?
[15:03] We need to talk.
[15:23] For how long are you guys here?
We were supposed to leave the day after tomorrow...
[15:27] but Faizan had a minor accident and then he got a viral infection...
[15:32] so we had to stay. We're here for a day... why don't you guys stay with us?
No, they can't stay, you told me that you guys had your flight...
[15:40] When is that?
Tomorrow.
[15:42] No for tonight, you told me, so they'll have to leave.
[15:47] Oh... I was thinking that all of us should go out to dinner tonight.
[15:52] It's not a problem, we can postpone our flight.
[15:56] If your husband doesn't mind, we can go to dinner.
[16:00] Why would he object? He'll get brother Zohaib's company and I will get yours.
[16:05] Let them go, the airport has a two-hour reporting time. You have that meeting with that multi-national client, right?
[16:12] Yes, of course.
[16:13] I'll ask the driver to drop you off.
Not a problem, I'll manage.
[16:18] I will not let them leave without having dinner.
No need to go through the trouble. We'll visit some other time.
[16:27] Zohaib what's the matter with you? We should stay if she's insisting.
That's more like it.
[16:35] Drink tea, then I'll have lunch served.
Great.
[17:11] Why are you two being so formal? Your plate is empty.
[17:16] No... thanks.
If you like something else, tell me, and I'll have it made right away.
[17:22] Actually, I'm on a diet and I don't eat such oily food.
[17:27] Forget your diet now, you're out to have a good time, so eat. Besides you're so slim and pretty, you don't need a diet.
[17:37] I'm not prettier than you...
[17:43] You're very lucky to have a beautiful wife Faizan.
[17:48] Was it an arranged, or love marriage?
Of course, it was love.
[17:53] It was arranged, but we fell in love after our marriage, right Faizan?
[18:00] Eat and I'll ask the driver to drop you guys off.
We'll go as we came. Don't worry about us.
[18:13] No Faizan, keep this back...
[18:17] Why, what happened?
[18:18] The doctor has asked you not to eat spicy food. I've asked Sultan to make soft food for you.
[18:29] There he is... at least be careful for a few days.
[18:35] Brother Sultan bring his medicine as well.
[18:40] Eat this and then you can have your medicine.
Faizan, you are lucky to have such a loving and caring wife.
[18:52] He's not lucky, I am. He takes care of me, as much as I care for him.
[19:08] What happened?
[19:10] My throat is hurting, could you please get the medicine?
[19:14] I've asked Sultan to get it.
He's taking ages, please go and get it.
[19:20] Okay sure.
[19:35] The two of you, get up and leave...
[19:39] I will not go anywhere.
Zohaib, make her understand.
[19:45] I'll meet you in the evening, but right now, leave.
[20:54] Where did they go?
[20:56] They were in a rush, that's why they left. I tried stopping them, but still they left.
[21:01] Come on Faizan, they didn't even finish having lunch. You could have at least let them finish.
[21:07] I have a meeting at night. I might get late, I hope you won't get bored.
[21:14] But you're not well.
I'm fine now. I feel better.
[21:28] He was right.
[21:31] I...
[21:32] am lucky.
[22:04] Hey...
Why are you here? What do you want?
[22:10] I came here to meet you.
Don't come to meet me secret.
[22:15] I'm your wife, not your girlfriend. You don't need excuses to meet me.
[22:21] I know but to the world...
I don't care about the world... I'm tired of this. Stop this cat-and-mouse game.
[22:29] Tell your parents about me.
[22:34] It's not possible. This can't happen and you know that.
[22:38] Why?
Do you know why, why do you argue over this again and again?
[22:42] Faizan, what will happen? How much longer should I wait, watching you enjoy with Hadia?
[22:51] You told me that this was a forced marriage, and neither of you was happy.
[22:55] But I think the situation is different. What is going on?
[23:00] Ramsha, listen to me...
I don't want to hear anything you say.
[23:05] You're a liar and fraud. Go away from here!
[23:09] Hadia is the one who is betrayed, not you. Hadia is the one who was cheated on, not you!
[23:17] What? What did you say?
[23:22] Initially, I had to come here for a business meeting. Father said Hadia with me, what's so wrong with it?
[23:30] You told me that you would be here for a few days, it's been a week, I'm alone there and you don't care at all.
[23:38] I was in an accident, don't you care about that, can't you see? Why are you fighting over this?
[23:54] I came here for you today... let's just go somewhere, we can talk about this some other day. Let's ruin our mood.
[24:01] I don't want to go anywhere with you. Go to your beautiful wife Hadia.
[24:07] Who you had an arranged marriage with and then fell in love with? I'm the one who is a foo.
[25:01] I think there is a misunderstanding between us.
[25:05] I think we should drive this misunderstanding.
But I don't think that.
[25:12] Misunderstandings are cleared where there are relationships and we don't have relationships.
[25:30] You're a good man... there is no doubt about that.
[25:40] But now...
[25:43] I don't need your sympathies or your help.
[26:25] May God give you happiness.
[26:29] Wherever you are...
[26:33] be happy.
[28:38] Faizan... get up.
[28:44] Not now, I'm very sleepy.
[28:48] You're bound to be, you were out all night. You don't care about your health at all.
[28:53] I'll ask father not to ask you to attend late-night meetings.
What?
[28:58] No, don't tell what father said, he'll think I asked you to say such things. I'm up...
[29:07] He already taunts me over everything. Wouldn't you like it if he sees me working?
[29:18] Alright, I won't say anything. Drink your tea and let's go outside. I want to shop for everyone today.
[29:26] I'll spend the entire day with you today. I'll go wherever you want.
[29:31] But I have to attend the meeting in the evening.
[29:36] Okay... drink your tea and then we'll leave.
[29:43] It's... hot.
[29:45] Sorry...
[29:49] The tickets are here, we have a flight tomorrow.
[29:52] Okay, I'll pack everything on time.
Sure...
[29:57] Alright, drink your tea and come outside.
[30:29] I thought Razi was so wrong. I used to always turn him away.
[30:36] And he didn't even care for my life for me.
[30:41] He freed me from a man like Sherry. He unveiled Sherry's true face to me.
[30:48] If it weren't for Razi, then maybe I wouldn't be in this home today.
[30:57] I was spending a life of helplessness with Sherry...
[31:03] And father maybe would have removed me from his inheritance. No matter how much I thank Razi isn't enough...
[31:32] Razi, our Chinese delegation is in Islamabad. Our contractor has a meeting in Burban with them.
[31:40] Faizan is not well, and he won't be able to make it. See that this is sorted.
[31:49] What happened, is everything alright?
He's been sick for the past few days. I want you to meet that delegation...
[32:01] I want to start the construction as soon as possible.
[32:06] Alright, as you wish.
[32:07] Book your ticket as soon as possible and give a presentation as soon as possible.
[32:16] I will call Faizan.
Don't do that. He's not well...
[32:23] Let him rest. I want him to spend some time with Hadia.
[32:30] As far as you are concerned, you can handle business matters better than him.
[32:42] Sure... I'll do that. Don't worry about that.
[32:46] Thank you, my dear.
[32:55] Sure Mr. Mazhar...
[33:00] Alright, book me on the flight that's leaving in four hours...
[33:04] Alright, thank you...
Brother Razi, mother said to keep warm clothes, it will be cold there.
[33:12] I've already done that.
What is this? Are you going right now?
[33:21] I've got an early flight, so I'll have to go.
[33:29] Why, what happened?
Brother...
[33:33] Are you alright?
[33:37] Yes... I'm fine. What's with you?
[33:43] No, I was just asking.
[33:47] It's good that uncle Safdar sent you out of the city. This way you'll get out of this tense environment.
[33:54] Look... I'm going to work, not to have a picnic.
[33:59] I know that, when the work is done, then you can have a picnic.
[34:05] If you're finished, may I leave, I'm already late.
[34:10] I was talking in your favor...
[34:13] I beg you to stop. 
[34:18] Take care and come back soon.
[34:27] You take care as well...
[34:29] Please, keep mother away. She's very sarcastic.
[34:33] And... as soon as possible.
[34:37] Okay? Okay... bye...
[34:53] Razi...
[34:59] I wanted to say something to you.
[35:05] What is it?
[35:07] I wanted to apologize to you and I wanted to thank you as well.
[35:15] No, it's okay.
[35:18] There is no need for you to apologize.
No, there is. I always thought you were wrong...
[35:25] I always degraded you, but still, you played on your life and saved me from that place. You saved my life.
[35:34] I don't know how to thank you and apologize to you.
[35:43] Look, Natasha...
[35:48] you are embarrassing me. If you want to apologize to someone, apologize to your mother and father.
[35:54] You've hurt them, right?
[36:01] Razi, I cried in front of father for forgiveness in front of you...
[36:06] But he hasn't forgiven me. He doesn't talk to me, he doesn't even look at me.
[36:12] I don't think his heart will ever be clear regarding me.
[36:17] Don't worry.
[36:19] Give him time, slowly he'll forget everything.
[36:23] And he'll behave normally with you again.
I will...
[36:29] But please, forget everything and forgive me.
[36:34] Can't we become good friends?
[36:41] On one condition...
What?
[36:46] The condition is simple, you have to take care of your parents.
[36:52] Don't ever worry about them. Promise me this...
[36:56] Definitely, I accept it. Shake my hand now.
[37:00] Haven't you forgiven me?
[37:04] I was never upset with you.
[37:08] Now please, you don't need to keep apologizing to me.
[37:13] You look more sensible and mature to me than before...
[37:17] And... promise me that you won't do anything like that again, alright?
[37:22] I won't.
[37:26] Good luck...
When are you coming back from Islamabad?
[37:32] Soon...
[37:34] Take care...
You take care as well.
[38:25] Hello mother, how are you?
You tell me, how are you?
[38:28] You didn't tell me how you were doing, once you reached there.
What are you saying?
[38:33] How can I forget you? Who do I have instead of you and Faizi?
[38:40] How's Faizan? Is everything alright?
[38:44] Was he upset at you, seeing you there?
No, rather I was upset at him...
[38:50] He came to Islamabad with Hadia, without telling me.
[38:53] Did Hadia recognize you?
No Faizi made an excuse...
[38:58] He told me that I was his friend Zohaib's wife.
What?
[39:03] And you let this happen? Didn't you stop him from doing this?
[39:08] No mother... I wasn't able to do anything for the moment.
[39:11] But, see what I'll do with Hadia...
[39:16] If I don't remove her from Faizan's life, then my name isn't Ramsha.
[39:26] Mother, I have to go now. I have to get ready and go for lunch.
[39:32] Alright fine. Take care, and keep me updated on things. Bye.
