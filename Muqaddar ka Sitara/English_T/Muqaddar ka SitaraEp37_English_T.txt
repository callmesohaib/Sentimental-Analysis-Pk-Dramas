[01:15] hello!
[01:17] have you seen the time? I've been waiting for you since an hour, where have you been!
[01:22] easy
[01:25] by the way, what's up with you?
[01:28] you guys completely change after marriage
[01:30] you used to only complain when you were a girlfriend, since you have become a wife
[01:34] now you complain, get angry & upset too
[01:37] Faizan, I think now its the right time that we shall tell everyone about our relation
[01:41] what do you think?
[01:43] what do you want me to do? Do you want me to shout & tell everyone that we have got married so that my dad will oust me from the house?
[01:47] when did I said that?
But Faizan, we have to take out the solution of this problem
[01:55] and, the biggest hurdle of our path is Hadia
[02:01] why don't we plan something that she shall go away from the path automatically?
[02:09] what!
[02:13] yes... why are you so amazed?
[02:17] what do you think? Will I be meeting you secretly for my entire life?
[02:21] listen to me Faizan
[02:22] I don't like to ruin my life, understand!
[02:28] as it is, you cannot divorce her because of your father
[02:32] so we have to plan something eventually
[02:34] what is wrong with you, what are you saying?
[02:41] Faizan, do you remember you had told me that Hadia had an affair in the past. Something like that
[02:48] yes, I had told you. So?
[02:50] don't you worry. Leave all the planning on me
[02:54] I will plan something that Hadia will be defamed & she won't be able to show her face to anyone
[03:01] then your father will oust her from his house & our path will be cleared
[03:09] Ramsha, I think you have gone mad
[03:12] what are you saying!
[03:14] Faizan, I am trying to help you
[03:20] this is the only solution to remove Hadia from our path
[03:35] I'm out of here, I think you've gone mad
[03:38] Faizan, listen to me
[03:40] Faizi! wait
[03:42] Faizan, listen to me... what's your problem?
[03:55] Faizi, listen to me
[03:57] Faizan, what is with you? wait a minute
what is it?
[04:02] Faizi, why are you being so upset? I said, I am sorry
[04:06] I will do whatever you will ask me to do
[04:09] I am not asking you to tell everyone right away. We won't tell anyone till you don't want to
[04:14] do you remember, we had got married on one condition that this marriage will remain a secret till I want it to be
[04:18] I know, and you know how much you mean to me
[04:22] I won't do anything to hurt you
[04:24] then why are you forcing me?
[04:26] Faizi, I said I'm sorry
[04:28] I said, I will do everything as per your will
[04:32] now come on, please cheer up. Fix your mood
[04:35] lets go somewhere else, come on
[04:37] come on Faizi, lets have some fun. Come
[04:40] come on
[05:01] today's episode is so interesting, right?
[05:04] yes
[05:06] ok tell me, did you call Razi?
[05:09] has he reached safely in the morning?
[05:12] there wasn't any network
[05:13] I am asking you that whether you have called Razi or not, & you are saying that there wasn't any network
[05:19] oh mom! I had called him but his phone wasn't connecting
[05:23] I think there are no network over there
[05:25] Okay
[05:27] its alright, I will call him myself
[05:31] by the way mom
[05:32] there is one thing
[05:33] yes?
[05:35] since sister Hadia is not here, so this house looks so deserted
[05:39] she used to keep me busy in some work when she was here
[05:44] I have become so bored without her
[05:46] yes, she is such a nice girl. She has a quality of keeping all the relations together
[05:52] she takes very good care of everyone
[05:58] her parents have done very nice upbringing of her
[06:03] there is so much liveliness int he house when she is around
[06:10] Natasha & Sheena! they hardly stays in the house
[06:20] sister Hadia must be enjoying a lot
[06:22] yes

[06:29] I just pray to God that they come back safely
[06:32] hmm.. Amen
[06:40] mom, tell me something
[06:43] yes
[06:44] by the grace of God, brother is getting a handsome salary now
[06:48] so why don't we go for an outing?
[06:53] I will tell Razi to take you as well
[06:56] only me? and what about you?
[06:59] what will I do by going? I don't feel like going anywhere
[07:04] if you will not go, then nobody will go
[07:06] oh

[07:11] she was just talking about some outing
[07:14] yes, one should go out. Till when you will keep yourself closed in a room?
[07:19] now see, Natasha is quite social. She keeps wandering around
[07:24] girls of your age goes out for outings
[07:29] Sheena, did you talk to the kids? are they fine?
[07:34] are they fine over there?
[07:36] yes, they must be fine
[07:38] Faizan was having light fever, but I'm sure he must be fine now
[07:42] I'm not that kind of a mother who disturbs their kids privacy by calling them again & again
[07:47] they are mature & they will handle it
[07:49] don't worry about my kids but yours
[07:54] but I was just saying like that
[08:02] I had told you not to talk to her much
[08:21] brother Sultan, is the dinner ready?
[08:23] yes madam, its ready. If you say so then shall I serve it?
[08:26] No, let Faizan come then serve it
[08:28] but sir had said that he will come late
[08:32] and he will come after dinner
[08:35] what happen, why the light has gone?
[08:37] let me check, the generator is not working since yesterday
[08:40] let me bring the lantern first, then I will get mechanic to fix the generator
[09:03] greetings, Sir Razi how are you?
[09:05] greetings to you too!
[09:20] why its so dark here?
[09:21] the light has gone & the generator is not working
[09:24] Okay
[09:26] where is Faizan?
[09:27] he hasn't come as of yet, but madam is inside
[09:29] ok fine
[09:40] Faizan! its good that you came
[09:43] I was so scared, you know there is no light & the generator is off as well
[09:51] Hadia
[09:55] I...
[09:58] I'm Razi
[10:01] you!
[10:15] Gul Muhammad, whose car is it? Who came?
[10:17] Mr. Razi is here
[10:19] who?
[10:19] Mr. Razi is here
[10:40] Hadia
[10:52] don't worry
[10:55] its my mistake
[11:00] why you came without informing?
[11:07] I'm sorry
[11:11] maybe I came on the wrong time... 
[11:16] I should have come after informing you
[11:23] you shouldn't have come
[11:26] even Faizan is not at home
[11:34] where is he?
[11:36] he has gone to meet the contractor
[11:38] dad had asked him to
[11:43] he said this to you, & you have believed it?
[11:52] what there to not believe?
[11:55] he does this to you on daily basis
[11:58] why didn't you tell uncle?
[12:00] he meets a girl by making an excuse of a business meeting
[12:04] what rubbish you are talking!
[12:13] Hadia
[12:17] Faizan is having an affair with a girl since so long
[12:21] yes
[12:24] and he had an affair before marriage, and I thought that he will fix himself after marriage but no!
[12:30] he is betraying you
[12:33] I had seen him with Ramsha with my own eyes 
[12:39] you are lying!
[12:41] Faizan doesn't have any relation with Ramsha anymore, he had sweared upon my life. He made me believed it
[12:50] you are... 
[12:54] so naive
[12:58] he is making you a fool so easily
[13:11] you don't have any right to interfere in my personal matters
[13:15] I completely trust Faizan
[13:20] you are right
[13:25] what to do?
[13:29] I cannot see anyone betraying you Hadia
[13:33] I wouldn't have come here ever
[13:36] I saw him with my own eyes
[13:38] if I wouldn't have seen him, then I wouldn't have come to you today
[13:41] I came to tell you
[13:44] I know that it is your personal matter, and I don't have any right but... 
[13:54] Hadia
[13:56] Faizan used to like someone else before marriage
[14:11] uncle forced him to marry you
[14:21] he often meets her secretly
[14:25] yes
[14:29] I think you are pretending to be unaware unintentionally
[14:34] look, you don't need to worry. You should talk to Faizan about this problem
[14:38] if Faizan doesn't listen to you, then talk to uncle please
[14:44] you shouldn't show anymore patience
[14:49] what difference will it make if I will raise my voice?
[14:55] if Faizan loves that girl truly
[15:02] then no power in this world can stop him
[15:08] you are his wife
[15:13] you are married to him
[15:16] and marriage hold a strong power, Hadia
[15:22] you should try
[15:27] look... 
[15:28] you don't need to worry, I am with you
[15:31] if you ever need anything, I am always there with you
[15:38] please try
[15:46] its such a strange thing
[15:52] the people with whom our thinking matches
[15:56] our fate isn't connected to them
[16:05] I wish... 
[16:06] I wish, I had sent your proposal before Faizan's
[16:10] then this wouldn't have happened
[16:19] today you've been mine instead of Faizan's
[16:26] I have lost a diamond like person like you
[16:34] even if I will search for a person with a light
[16:40] still I won't be able to find a girl like you
[16:56] I'm such an unfortunate
[17:03] that I lost you because of my slightest mistake
[17:16] Hadia
[17:27] Faizan
[17:29] when did you come?
[17:41] why?
[17:45] weren't you expecting me to come?
[17:54] you guys must be amazed
[18:06] do you have an idea that... 
[18:09] what you are talking!
[18:17] I know it very well that what I am saying
[18:23] better late, but I've got to know about the affair of you two
[18:30] I've listened everything
[18:33] I've recorded everything, I've made a video with my phone
[18:46] you were disgusting
[18:49] but you will become so much disgusting, I had never thought of it
[19:04] its not me who is disgusting, but you Razi
[19:08] what were you doing with my wife so late at night in my absence!
[19:13] stop your rubbish!
[19:17] Faizan there isn't any such thing, let me explain you
[19:19] what will you explain me!
[19:24] what will you tell me?
[19:26] I've heard everything, I saw everything!
[19:36] he was the guy for whom you used to cry secretly?
[19:39] he, my cousin!
[19:43] Faizan, stop your rubbish otherwise!
[19:45] otherwise what?
[19:48] otherwise, what will you do? what can you do?
[20:01] Hadia, what I had thought of you & what kind of a person you are
[20:05] such a disgusting act, Hadia
[20:07] Ramsha is better than you. She doesn't only says it. She truly loves me
[20:22] so finally today you've accepted 
[20:26] that still you are in a relation with Ramsha 
[20:29] you meet her secretly, right?
[20:32] you have been betraying me!
[20:34] am I betraying you, Hadia?
[20:36] its you who is betraying me!
[20:38] by having an affair in my house with my cousin, in front of me
[20:41] I said, stop your rubbish Faizan otherwise I will break your face
[20:45] what will you do!
[20:46] Razi please go from here. Please leave
[20:49] I won't leave like this
[20:52] he is putting such a disgusting allegation on you
[20:57] I will go after solving this problem over here
[21:06] this matter won't be resolved here, it will be resolved in front of dad
[21:09] when he will see the video & tell who is the liar & who is telling the truth
[21:15] really!
[21:17] so
[21:22] so you will black mail me?
[21:26] I am not blackmailing you, I'm telling the truth Razi
[21:29] just imagine when dad will get to know that his dearest nephew is having an affair with his daughter in law in his house. Then what will he do?
[21:37] Faizan!
Razi!
[21:39] leave each other
leave from here Razi
[21:41] please leave. I will explain him
[21:43] please leave for God sake, I beg you
[21:47] please leave
[21:49] I am leaving
[21:53] I'm leaving
[21:56] I'm going
[22:07] Hadia
[22:13] Hadia
Hadia, what happen?
[22:15] Hadia get up
Hadia!
[22:17] what happen?
Hadia, what happen to her?
[22:19] how would I know? whatever happened its because of you
[22:21] its not the right time to argue, just call the doctor
[22:23] Hadia
[22:24] Salman! bring water
[22:27] Hadia, get up!
[22:27] Salman!
Hadia
[22:29] be quick!
[22:31] Hadia
[22:33] Hadia
[22:36] be quick!
[23:54] there is no need to worry
[23:56] we have injected an IV to her, & sent few blood samples for the test
[24:01] we will let you know as soon as we get the reports
[24:10] you go
[24:13] I won't go
[24:15] I won't go anywhere till Hadia doesn't gain he conscious
[24:20] really!
[24:26] what do you want, Razi?
[24:30] what do you want?
[24:32] should I call dad & tell him about the love story of you two?
[24:37] shall I tell him, how his dearest nephew is meeting his daughter in law... my wife secretly?
[24:43] uncle will never believe on your rubbish!
[24:49] really!
[24:51] you think this way
[24:53] but when he will see the video & the proof, then what do you think what will he say?
[24:58] will he believe me or not?
[25:02] there isn't any reality in those proves
[25:05] and you know it very well
[25:10] if you don't care about my respect, then at least think about your wife's respect
[25:15] she has started to trust you
[25:17] because of Ramsha...
shut up Razi!
[25:19] just shut up!
[25:23] enough!
[25:26] you've taken enough of my place
[25:29] you've always been taking my place
[25:31] but now I'll humiliate you a lot in front of dad, that he won't even see your face
[25:39] uncle trusts me & Hadia more than you
[25:44] do you remember?
[25:45] when uncle got to know about Ramsha for the very first time, did you noticed his reaction?
[25:51] just think
[25:53] when he will get to know that you are still in contact with Ramsha, then what will he do?
[25:57] I don't believe how come Hadia is living with such a disgusting person like you!
[26:01] Razi Shut up!
[26:02] please talk politely. Its a hospital & you are not allowed to make noise over here
[27:44] who is Hadia's husband?
[27:47] yes
[27:48] there is a good news for you
[27:50] your wife is expecting
[27:53] if you want you can meet her
[27:55] as it is, we will discharge her in a while
[29:09] congratulations!
[29:14] you are very lucky Hadia
[29:18] who got a good news even in her bad times
[29:31] I'm ready
[29:33] to forget everything
[29:35] I'm ready to forgive you, but...
[29:38] you have to promise me that you
[29:42] will not keep any contact with Razi, you won't talk to him ever
[29:47] I am ready to forgive all your sins & mistakes, just because you are about to become the mother of my baby unfortunately
[29:55] which mistake?
[29:57] which sin?
[30:00] even after seeing everything, you are asking me this?
[30:07] how can you even think such a disgusting thing?
[30:11] you are asking me this question after seeing so much!
[30:18] I feel like killing you & Razi, but I can't do it
[30:26] Sadly, I cannot do this because you are about to become the mother of my baby
[30:30] and I'm telling you that I am ready to forgive you & forget everything, but that Raazi
[30:35] I just hate him, I cannot stand him anymore
[30:39] I hate his face, his existence. I cannot stand him anymore
[30:45] how shall I explain you!
[30:47] how shall I make you believe that I & Razi was...
enough!
[30:50] enough Hadia!
[30:55] no third person will come in between us, that's it!
[30:58] the third person that is there in between us is not Raazi but Ramsha
[31:05] whom you talk secretly & meet
[31:09] don't know since when you are betraying me, & I was such a fool that I thought you have started loving me
[31:15] I don't have any relation with Razi
[31:17] don't make me fall in my eyes by saying such things
[31:20] enough Hadia! enough!
[31:23] whatever I saw yesterday, after that I don't need any kind of clarification
[31:30] I am going to kick him out of the house as soon as I reach Karachi
[31:36] and I won't let him stay in my dad's office, because I cannot tolerate him anymore
[31:45] just cannot!
[31:47] if you will defame Razi, then the fingers will be pointed on me as well
[32:40] brother Aleem, my good deed came in the way that...
[32:45] thanks to God
[32:48] Natasha came back home safely
[32:50] by the way, please don't mind but
[32:57] brother, its your mistake as well
[33:02] when you guys already know that the intentions of that guy wasn't good
[33:06] then you should have brought Natasha home earlier
[33:11] you people were after your ego
[33:15] I know that a daughter's grief breaks a person apart
[33:23] both of you have to keep yourself very strong & composed
[33:31] as it is, kids do make mistakes
[33:38] you also forgive your daughter
[33:42] she is our daughter, obviously we will forgive her
[33:52] sister, how is Natasha now?
[33:55] she is fine
[33:57] Safder has got that guy arrested, and made him sign the divorce papers
[34:05] may God bless her with good fate
[34:08] may God bless her with a nice guy, who shall value her & take care of her
[34:14] Amen
[34:17] have you guys come to meet us, or to add salt on our wounds?
[34:25] No sister, there isn't any such thing
[34:29] Natasha made a mistake, and your entire family is here to add salts on our wounds
[34:37] remember one thing
[34:38] we really don't need such false sympathies & hopes
[34:45] Sheena
[34:47] on such occasions
[34:49] instead of giving false hopes & sympathies, you should have taken care of our privacy & emotions
[34:55] I will ask Hadia for sure
[34:57] that why she had shared such a private matter of her in-laws family in her house?
[35:04] sister, you are taking us wrong
[35:06] we came to share your grief
[35:09] there isn't any such thing
[35:11] this is our private matter
[35:13] it would be better for you to stay away from it
[35:16] this is your daughter's in-laws family, Khadija
[35:19] you can come here to meet us
[35:21] but there is no need to interfere in our children matters
[35:37] I think we should leave now
[35:44] come on dear
[35:48] thanks to God they are back
[35:53] greetings!*
[36:02] what happen?
[36:04] are you fine?
[36:06] Hadia!

[36:19] anyways, how was your tour?
[36:22] it was Okay
[36:23] was it only okay?
[36:25] you have spent a lot of time over there, did you guys roam around or not?

[36:37] what is the matter?
[36:39] are you fine?
