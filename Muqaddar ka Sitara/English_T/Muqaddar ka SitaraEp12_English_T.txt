[01:08] Why did you have to make so many objections?
[01:12] You and your son have become so obstinate.
[01:17] I couldn't even think that I would have to explain to you on every step that you need to cooperate.
[01:27] brother Alim is now our relative and you object on everything he does. Be considerate!
[01:35] If he is our relative, should I make him sit on my head, even if he is being stupid?
[01:41] What did he do now?
[01:44] Safdar didn't you see.
[01:46] First he sent some cheap furniture to my house
[01:50] and now he brought some cheap oily breakfast early in the morning.
[01:57] I think if he could, he would stay here.
[02:00] That's what you're thinking.
[02:02] He's a very self made man
[02:05] and such people don't even drink water from their daughter's house.
[02:10] Whether he does that or not, I really don't care
[02:13] but I don't like all this nonsense.
What nonsense?
[02:18] These are our traditions.
[02:19] Safdar leave these antique traditions behind.
[02:23] He is finding something after another.
[02:28] Tell me, couldn't I give your daughter in law breakfast at home?
[02:33] I feel you like this oily breakfast.
[02:36] Then why did you come for breakfast. You shouldn't have come like your children didn't.
[02:42] Your son.. After what your son did, you should have been ashamed.
[02:47] He was drunk! Be thankful to Hadia.
[02:52] She's not so innocent. She'll speak one day.
[02:56] And then everyone will know about your son's antics.
[03:01] Rather than being thankful you're just accusing that respectable man.
[03:48] Alright, so you're here and I'm looking for you everywhere.
[03:58] Why were you looking for me?
[04:01] You're usually not home at this time so I made tea to have it with you.
[04:13] Thank you.
[04:23] It seems the tea got cold because you were looking for me.
[04:34] Give it to me, I'll make another one.
No.
[04:42] Are you upset?
[04:46] Do you know
[04:48] when mom said no to uncle
[04:51] I thought mom was wrong
[04:55] but I couldn't understand mom's foresight.
[04:59] Had uncle turned back on his decision, mom would have been very upset.
[05:05] So do you think I'm not upset?
[05:08] I didn't mean that. You're a very strong person.
[05:13] You bore it. But mom, she would have been broken.
[05:22] But this decision has hurt me very much.
[05:29] We respect uncle so much but he..
[05:38] No Farwa.
[05:41] Uncle has done us a lot of favors.
[05:45] I agree he has done so much for us but this doesn't mean...
[05:50] No.
[05:52] Let it be, its alright.
[05:56] I think you need  to make me another tea. Go.
[06:02] Are you sending me away.
[06:04] Of course. You're talking weird. You're making me crazy.
[06:13] We shouldn't really be sympathizing with anyone.
[06:16] I'm upset for you and you...
[06:23] Farwa, when did you start watching such films and dramas.
[06:33] I was fine alone and you came here with your tea and stupid talk.
[06:41] Think about it. You're missing out on good tea.
Please Farwa.
[06:46] Okay fine. I'll give it to mom.
[07:37] Are you done sleeping?
[07:40] Have you stopped being hungover?
[07:43] Have some shame Faizan?
[07:47] I had to lie for you.
[07:51] If Hadia's parents find out that you left her and went out with your drunkard friends to get drunk,
[07:59] do you know what will happen?
[08:01] They'll end everything!
[08:06] And my respect will be torn to shreds.
[08:11] I did what you wanted!
[08:19] I married Hadia.
[08:22] Now what else do you want me to do? Should I die for her?
[08:28] How are you talking to me?!
[08:31] Please go. I don't want to talk to anyone.
[08:35] Even I don't want to talk to you. But remember this Faizan,
[08:42] If you do anything wrong in the function today, I'll make a spectacle out of you! Ill mannered!
[09:06] There's nobody worse than you!
[09:49] Here is your juice. Take it.
[09:59] Whose calling? Don't answer it.
[10:04] Let him pine. It'll be a lot of fun. He's pining.
[10:23] I pity this guy. How many times has he called?
[10:55] Natasha, its time for your salon appointment and you're still here.
[10:59] Whats up mom? You're very excited for Faizan's reception.
[11:04] You were very irritated yesterday.
[11:06] I'm not excited for Faizan's reception but your preparation.
[11:12] For me? What do you mean?
[11:15] Natasha, didn't I tell you the reception will have your father's friends Mr. and Mrs. Rehman.
[11:20] Their son Nisar is a doctor in America.
[11:25] And again, why are you telling me this?
[11:27] I'm not telling you, I'm repeating it.
[11:30] Your dad and I like Nisar for you
[11:36] and I want Mrs. Rehman to like you.
[11:43] Right.
[11:45] That's why you selected this dress for me and this appointment. in the salon.
[11:51] Of course.
[11:54] Natasha trust me. Nisar is hundred times better than Razi. You'll be very happy with him.
[12:04] Listen to me. Get up and get ready. Get up.
[12:13] You can be really pushy at times.
For your benefit.
[12:25] You don't understand my condition Zohaib. I love her. I cannot live without her.
[12:29] Faizan relax. Nothing will happen to Ramsha. Just pray for her.
[12:34] I've been doing that.
[12:38] As soon as the reception is done, I'll fly to her. I want to meet her.
[12:43] No. Don't do that.
[12:45] Ramsha's mother is very upset with you.
[12:48] Let me calm her down and then both of us will go to Dubai to ask about our friend.
[12:54] Alright.
[12:56] Talk to her mother and ask her to answer my phone. I want to apologize to her.
[13:01] I will. Don't worry. Just relax.
[13:05] How can I relax? I am not at peace
[13:09] ever since I found out that she left me because of dad. I'll never forgive my father.
[13:15] I can never forgive him.
[13:16] Faizan don't do anything harsh in your rage. Your father is your bank balance.
[13:23] If you leave him, you'll be in a loss yourself.
[13:30] Okay
[13:32] Alright I'll talk to you later.
[15:35] Hello Shazia. How are you? How are you dear Nisar?
[15:41] I'm fine aunty, how are you?
Absolutely fine.
[15:44] Excuse me.
Sure.
[15:48] Shazia this is my daughter Natasha.
[15:51] Hie aunty.
How are you dear?
[15:52] Absolutely fine.
[15:54] Did you take any refreshments. Should I send something?
[15:58] Oh no. Its okay. You have arranged an amazing event for the reception.
Thank you.
[16:05] Your daughter in law is very beautiful. She's looking like a doll sitting there.
[16:10] Tell me, does your daughter in law have a sister?
[16:15] Yes of course.
[16:19] She does.
[16:20] I think its the girl sitting next to her.
[16:29] Yes she's the same.
[16:32] She's very beautiful.
[16:34] Thank you. Please sit. I'll send over something for you.
[16:38] Okay, thank you.
[19:06] Razi please let go of these cheap antics.
[19:09] I know very well why you're doing everything.
[19:14] Really?
[19:17] Then tell me why I'm doing everything?
[19:21] Obviously you want to be frank with me but let me just tell you,
[19:25] its not going to work here so please stop.
[22:00] Please allow us to leave, its getting late. The arrangements were amazing.
[22:08] Thank you very much.
[22:09] Thank you for coming. You graced this event with your presence.
[22:16] Will Hadia come with us?
[22:22] What? You want the reception bride to go back to her house?
[22:28] This might be some tradition as well.
No. Its nothing.
[22:38] Brides can visit their parents whenever they want after their wedding.
[22:46] Nothing is mandatory.
[22:55] Alright, thank God.
[22:57] Don't worry brother Aleem. Faizan will bring Hadia to your place.
[23:16] Please go see them off to their car.
[23:29] Please come.
[23:38] Alright dear.
[24:45] Will you keep standing there?
[24:53] Do you expect me to come there, hold your hand and make you sit here?
[25:03] This won't happen.
[25:29] You are beautiful.
[25:36] And now you'll want me to gift you something valuable. Every girl wants that.
[25:41] You're my wife.
[25:46] Its your right.
[25:50] Come.
[26:11] I don't know where mom kept the gift.
[26:17] How are you feeling now?
[26:21] What happened to me?
[26:25] Aunty was telling me you had food poisoning.
[26:29] I got food poisoning?
[26:34] Yes. It was painful but I'm better now.
[26:40] And how is your friend?
[26:47] What happened to my friend?
[26:50] He got into an accident on our wedding night.
[26:55] Severe accident. Doctors said that he's critical. He got injured but doing better.
[27:05] Are you not feeling irritated because of this heavy dress? Do you want to change?
[27:14] And listen?
Yes?
[27:16] Make coffee for me.
[27:18] Right now?
[27:23] Yes.
[27:27] You look good.
[27:30] Make coffee we'll talk. I want to know you.
[27:36] I cannot hold a conversation without a coffee. It seems awkward. Make coffee.
[28:02] Where did you keep the gift?
[28:04] Gift? Why? Is she asking for it?
[28:08] No she isn't. I want to give her myself.
[28:11] Give it to her tomorrow. I don't remember where I kept it.
[28:14] What do you mean you don't remember? What is this?
[28:17] What do you mean? Give it to her tomorrow.
[30:28] You in the kitchen, at this hour?
[30:35] Did you want something?
[30:39] I wanted to make coffee
[30:45] but I can't find it.
[30:48] Did Faizan ask you to make it?
[30:58] What did you break here?
[31:08] What are you doing here?
[31:15] She's here to make coffee for Faizan.
[31:22] Yes he takes coffee at this hour.
[31:32] What are you doing here?
[31:35] I'm here to get water.
[31:38] Please help her to find coffee.
[31:42] She's worried.
[31:48] Good night.
[31:59] The coffee is in the last cabinet.
[32:03] And listen, make coffee and go to your room fast.
[32:08] Don't tell your uncle about it.
[33:07] Faizan?
[33:14] Faizan?
[33:59] Hello uncle.
Hello. May you live long. Set it here and call..
[34:06] Hello.
Hello. I was asking about you. Where is Razi?
[34:12] He was up all night and left for work early in the morning.
[34:17] Without breakfast?
[34:19] He said he would have breakfast in office.
[34:25] How can he live without eating? He'll eat at the office. You continue please.
[34:32] I will but where are Faizan and Hadia. Why aren't they here yet?
[34:38] Don't you know Faizan doesn't wake up early? Hadia might be asleep as well.
[34:44] I have to attend an important meeting. I stayed back to have breakfast with them. Go and call them.
[34:52] Sure uncle. I'll go and call them.
[34:57] You should have told them that we'll have breakfast together.
[35:32] Faizan
[35:36] please wake up. Its morning.
[35:40] What should I do if its morning? Its everyday.
[35:46] Lets have breakfast its 10'o clock.
[35:55] I wake up at 12. If you want to go, go ahead.
[36:13] Where are you going?
[36:27] Beautiful..
[36:32] Do you know something?
[36:41] I was worried without a reason.
[36:44] Dad's choice isn't bad at all.
[37:03] We're coming.
[37:11] You go ahead. I'm coming.
[37:41] Hello.
Hello. May you live long dear. Come sit with me.
[38:03] No dear. Come sit with Hadia.
[38:08] But I always sit there.
[38:11] Yes but you'll sit here with Hadia now.
[38:15] I don't care whether someone comes or leaves. I'm not changing my lifestyle.
[38:22] Faizan sit with Hadia. She'll like it and so will we.
[38:31] Please sit.
[38:54] What is all this? You know I get fresh juice every morning not all this. Get me one.
[39:00] I'll go make it.
[39:01] No dear. You sit. I'm done with my breakfast. I'll make it.
[39:18] Please start with the name of God dear.
