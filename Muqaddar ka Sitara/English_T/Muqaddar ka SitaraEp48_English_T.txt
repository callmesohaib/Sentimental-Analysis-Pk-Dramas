[01:11] Your sister is just like you!
[01:15] What do you mean?
[01:17] The same like you are cheating on me!
[01:22] Stop it Faizan.
[01:35] Your personality has changed! You just act innocent.
[01:41] You are not loyal at all.
[04:19] Hello! Hi!
[04:22] Good morning!
[04:25] Why are you so serious always?
[04:30] Serious? No I'm not.
[04:33] I might be!
[04:35] I actually like your this act!
[04:38] I'm just a little too talkative.
[04:43] No! I don't think that.
[04:48] So why are you not my proper friend yet?
[04:52] Friendship?
[04:54] I'm conversing with you! What else do you call a friendship?
[04:57] We don't have that understanding yet!
[05:03] So why is it important to build some understanding in friendship?
[05:09] It is really important for friends to understand each other.
[05:13] And now you have to give me proper time.
[05:16] We'll join each other on morning jogs.
[05:22] And enjoy some long drives later. How about that? We'll get to know each other better.
[05:27] That's all good Natasha but I think you should be friends with Farwa as she can be your good friend, and Fizza too. Also Hadia.
[05:43] You can talk to her too.
[05:45] I'm already friends with Farwa! As I'm learning to cook your favorite dishes.
[05:52] Why my favorite dishes?
[05:55] Look! I'm doing this all for you. I've left my old friends.
[06:02] Now I've started to study properly, and spend my time at home. I've started cooking as well.
[06:09] Why for me?
[06:11] You tell me! Can't you guess why I'm doing this all for you?
[06:17] No! I don't know.
[06:21] Raazi! Why do you act so dumb? I'm doing this all for you.
[06:27] It's because I love you and I want to become the girl that you desire for.
[06:41] Are you in your senses? What are you doing.
[06:46] What's wrong in it?
[06:49] What happened? What's wrong about that?
[06:54] Natasha! Do you remember how you used to misbehave with me when you came to Pakistan for the first time, and I used to live at your place.
[07:06] You used to tell me that I'm nothing without your father.
[07:11] Raazi I'm really sorry for what I've done.
[07:17] I was wrong at that time and I didn't realize my reaction towards you was embarrassing.
[07:22] But now I respect you.
[07:26] I feel sorry for everything that I've done and said!
[07:32] Why are you doing this all?
[07:34] I've started to fall in love with you. That's why!
[07:39] Don't act so childish Natasha! This is very bad.
[07:43] Why are you not taking me seriously?
[07:48] That's because we are different from each other.
[07:51] So Raazi that's good. Opposites attract!
[07:55] It's not mandatory for us to be the same, to get married.
[08:01] Raazi! I'll surely become the girl you like. Just like Hadia and Farwa's type.
[08:07] I'll only stay indoors for you. I'll change my style for you, and I'm also learning to cook for you.
[08:18] I'll become the girl that you desire for!
[08:23] No Natasha! I don't want that.
[08:29] You are perfect as you are! You don't need to change yourself. You are perfect.
[09:43] Fizza is absolutely right mother! She deserves a better guy than Nisar. It's like Nisar didn't deserve her. There will be soon more proposals for her.
[09:53] Sure daughter! But I liked that boy in reality.
[10:00] He was so educated, well mannered and respectful.
[10:03] I felt so bad.
[10:05] I also felt bad mother as I also praised his personality.
[10:09] You are absolutely right about him but what can we do now?
[10:13] I feel so angry and hefty right now.
[10:19] I might even kill him if I he decides to confront me. Why would he do such thing with my daughter?
[10:25] I would do the same but how would we find him?
[10:30] Sure darling!
[10:32] Raazi told me.
[10:36] Your Father didn't allow.
[10:39] Father is right!
[10:42] We'll get more embarrassed after such act!
[10:45] Why should we take favor from anyone! People nowadays don't even believe such things!
[10:51] Fizza's matter will be discussed widely in my house! And I don't want that.
[10:56] Now you should just pray that God should not forgive the one who played with our respect.
[11:03] Amen!
[11:05] Are you fine!
[11:08] I'm absolutely fine! What will happen to me?
[11:10] You should not worry about me!
[11:13] Why should I not worry?
[11:16] You should take care of yourself!
[11:34] I'm doing this all just for you! It's because I love you.
[11:41] I want to become the girl of your desire.
[11:52] This is not good at all.
[11:57] I don't know what's in her mind! If she talks about such a thing in her family, I'll be pressurized.
[12:07] Mother's right! I think I should leave.
[12:13] But uncle won't let me leave! What should I do?
[12:20] I cannot accept Natasha at all.
[12:28] I cannot return the favors of my uncle my whole life!
[12:33] But If I marry Natasha!
[12:59] Raazi! I've asked you so many times about your marriage. Why don't you answer?
[13:13] Mother! The pictures you showed me.
[13:21] You can choose according to your choice.
[13:24] Thank god!
[13:27] Thank god you said this! You know that I like a girl. Her name is Rubab.
[13:35] I'll send you her picture.
[14:25] Listen Zohaib! You cannot come here anytime you want too. Faizan can be here any moment!
[14:33] It would be bad for us.
[14:36] But Faizan didn't visit us after that day.
[14:40] That is more risky because he can come anytime.
[14:46] You are right but I just talked to Faizan. He is in office with his father.
[14:53] That's why I came.
[14:56] I also did! He is busy with his official work nowadays.
[15:02] He might not visit for a bit.
[15:04] How is he suddenly so busy nowadays.
[15:10] Mother if you ask the truth. I don't think that he is so interested in his office.
[15:15] I think it's just an excuse! There might be some problems with his wife. I'm just guessing it.
[15:24] You know well that he doesn't share things so often with me.
[15:27] You are so lucky Rimsha! We were discussing Hadia that day, and suddenly they both came in front of you and just like that you recorded them.
[15:38] Fine! But that recording didn't benefit me at all.
[15:43] When I showed that video to Faizan! He didn't react that much.
[15:49] I felt like he didn't care that much, that his wife is hanging out with his cousin so openly.
[15:58] He might be blindfolded or he has started to value her so much that these acts of her don't affect him.
[16:07] People always prefer there first wife always. Even if they don't love her.
[16:16] Second marriage is most of the times hidden. The groom doesn't show affection to his second wife at all.
[16:29] It's not a sin to marry again! The first wife always acts innocent in front of the world after her husband marries again.
[16:43] Men! Nowadays, men don't have the guts to talk about their second marriage at all.
[16:58] You are absolutely right! Faizan is not less than his father at all. After his father dies, He'll surely be the next Safdar but exclusive.
[17:10] Such people don't care about anything more than their status.
[17:16] Rimsha! He won't ever prefer you over Hadia at all.
[17:25] I'm worried if Hadia gives birth! She'll be on his mind my forever. Faizan won't leave her.
[17:37] Rimsha I know! You want yourself as Faizan's wife and part of his family but
[17:46] Just think about it! Even after trying so many things, you fail your plan. You still need another option, right? You should yourself be so rich.
[18:03] That you can live the life of your choice just like Hadia.
[18:11] Then you should yourself suggest me something Zohaib!
[18:17] I have a cousin in Dubai. He is a proper builder! Nowadays he is in Karachi.
[18:25] He has great opportunities for investment. I have myself invested. You should also invest a little amount.
[18:35] It'll surely profit you.
[18:38] How can I invest on my own? I don't have such amount. I can try taking some from Faizan!
[18:50] You can help me with this for sure.
[18:56] How?
[19:01] We can arrange a meeting of Faizan and your builder cousin on purpose.
[19:15] OK! Then this is what you should do.
[19:22] Organize a party! Invite me obviously! I'll bring my cousin with me.
[19:31] We'll get them to meet each other and my cousin has a very interesting personality.
[19:38] My cousin can handle everything on his own as he knows how to sell his investments.
[19:44] Are you sure that this won't bring any bad to me?
[19:51] Rimsha! Before taking any such step, you've to think twice or it might result in some loss later.
[20:01] Rimsha! If you don't trust me. It's completely fine.
[20:06] Nobody is actually forcing you!
[20:09] He always suggests something foolish.
[20:14] Mother we'll think about this properly. Relax! Why are you getting so worked up.
[20:20] We are in a kind of trouble Rimsha.
[20:24] We'll think about it.
[20:54] Mother! I have a question!
[20:59] Will you help me get married to Raazi? Yes or no?
[21:03] Never!
[21:05] Fine! Then I'll go and tell father that you were involved in Fizza's case and everything happened because of you.
[21:12] So you'll blackmail your own mother? You'll blackmail me?
[21:18] Sure! If you can perform such an act to break someones relationship.
[21:23] Then why can't I force you to get myself a relationship.
[21:27] You know well that what will be your father's reaction!
[21:30] You should have thought about this before Mother!
[21:35] Natasha! Don't test my patience! I'm warning you the last time.
[21:40] Then you need to stop pushing me as well mother!
[21:43] I'm also telling you last time.
[21:45] I'm in love with Raazi and I cannot live without him.
[21:56] You did this all because you could see me hurt, right? Can't you see now that I'm still getting hurt.
[22:35] This product has more sales and orders, so double it!
[22:43] I'll call you back in some time! Sure! OK!
[22:54] Yes Fizza?
[22:56] Greetings Raazi!
[22:57] Greetings!
[22:59] I have sent you his name, number and other details.
[23:08] Good!
[23:10] And also.
[23:13] Fawad doesn't love me at all! He just lies.
[23:18] If he really loved me.
[23:21] He wouldn't disrespect me like this! He would have cared for me.
[23:26] I just want to know the reason behind this all.
[23:32] Just let me know the reason.
[23:35] Don't worry! I'll inform you everything.
[23:40] Thank you! And listen.
[23:43] Don't let anyone know about this. Not even my parents.
[23:48] I told you.
[23:53] Don't worry.
[23:55] Thank you.
[23:57] No problem! Goodbye!
[24:39] Yes mother!
[24:39] Where are you son?
[24:41] Mother! I am
[24:44] Busy with some official work!
[24:46] I wanted to congratulate you.
[24:48] About what?
[24:50] The people who came for Farwa's proposal. They are happy with her.
[24:56] This is great! Congratulations.
[24:58] Congrats to you too! they were saying that we are ready for the wedding.
[25:05] Mother don't worry! I'll surely handle everything.
[25:08] I'll arrange her wedding in the best way.
[25:11] For sure!
[25:13] Son! Today I'm really happy.
[25:16] Sure mother! I'll be back in a bit.
[25:18] Listen! While coming back, give some charity!
[25:23] Sure mother! I'll do it.
[25:26] OK son! Now I'll hang up.
[25:28] I'll inform your uncle about this happy news too.
[25:30] Sure! Bye!
[25:32] Bye!
[25:51] I just got better a week ago! That guy was selfish. He didn't even tell his name in the hospital.
[26:01] When I became conscious, I saw him leaving.
[26:08] He didn't even tell me about his university! I searched for him at many institutes but finally today I've found him.
[26:17] Sir! I've a request.
[26:20] I know it's not your policy to provide any private information or details but for the sake of humanity.
[26:27] Let me know his number or home address, as I want to meet his family.
[26:34] I want to thank them! Please.
[27:04] Greetings! Are you Fizza's relative, right?
[27:11] Greetings!
[27:12] I'm Fizza's friend! She showed me her sister's wedding photos. I recognized you from there.
[27:20] OK!
[27:21] Fizza is not attending the university from so many days. I've tried calling her but she didn't pick any of my calls.
[27:28] Is she fine?
[27:29] She is absolutely fine! She actually went back to Hydrabad. She might not ever come back in this university.
[27:38] Yes! I know! It's all because of that Fawad.
[27:41] If he didn't tease Fizza! Fizza would have never left.
[27:46] Who is this Fawad?
[27:48] Do you know him?
[27:49] The whole university knows him!
[27:51] He is such a mentally disturbed boy. Fizza tried to help him so many times.
[27:56] But he didn't stop his foolish acts.
[27:59] The whole university saw his and Fizza's pictures. Just because of him.
[28:05] Fizza was just worried about his career! That is why she didn't take any action. He doesn't deserve it anyway.
[28:12] If you don't mind. Can you tell me about him something more interesting.
[28:19] Since the day Fizza's pictures went viral! I haven't seen Fawad in the university.
[28:31] Fine! Thank you so much. Your good name?
[28:34] Momal!
[28:36] Thank you for helping me with all this information.
[28:38] Your welcome! Tell Fizza that she should talk to me.
[28:43] Sure! Thank you! Thank you so much!
[28:53] Leave it! What about the factory?
[28:56] It's good that you guys are here. I wanted to tell something important.
[29:01] Sister! Come and sit. You seem so happy.
[29:05] Yes Safdar! I'm actually really happy today.
[29:09] Do you remember that we had invited some people over for Farwa's proposal.
[29:12] Yes! I remember.
[29:14] They have accepted the proposal.
[29:16] And now they want our response!
[29:18] Congrats sister!  Congrats sister!
[29:20] You should believe that I liked that boy the same day.
[29:23] He is a great guy! I was already waiting for them to accept the proposal.
[29:26] If you guys have time! Can we visit them next week?
[29:32] What are you talking about sister? I am always free for you.
[29:35] If you allow! We'll arrange an engagement on the coming Sunday.
[29:40] No! No need to arrange an engagement. They want to get them both married quickly.
[29:45] We'll arrange a small event and then they both will get married.
[29:49] That's also good sister!
[29:51] It's been so many days since there has been no enjoyment around our house. We'll enjoy this event.
[29:57] I'll get Farwa married the same way as I thought about Natasha!
[30:05] Natasha just.
[30:09] Don't get dis hearted Safdar! Kids make mistakes. Forget about it.
[30:16] After her iddat completes, Find a nice groom for hr and get her married.
[30:22] Sister! Why should we find?
[30:26] We have a guy already at home.
[30:29] Get Raazi married before as he is elder.
[30:38] I have told him but he always ignores me by telling me to get Farwa married.
[30:50] We can get them both married together. Farwa will depart and you can take your niece with yourself. What about it Safdar?
[31:11] What are you thinking sister?
[31:14] She is the daughter of your lovely brother, right?
[31:22] That's fine Sheena but you know there's a difference between Raazi's and Natasha's attitude.
[31:29] Only Safdar wanted this proposal to happen. Neither you nor Natasha!
[31:40] Leave the past behind now! I didn't know Raazi at that time. Now I know him very well. He is just like the guy I desired for Natasha!
[31:58] And now Natasha doesn't mind at all.
[32:05] But now Raazi won't accept.
[32:16] Try talking to him about this.
[32:21] I think Raazi will accept!
[32:25] But It looks like you don't want this to happen.
[32:30] Or it might be because you are hurt from our denial.
[32:38] No! It's nothing like that.
[32:42] Then you should accept this proposal, right! Natasha is your brother's most loving child.
[32:51] That brother of yours, who made your son such a huge business man and gave you a place to stay.
[32:59] Sheena!
[33:04] Let me speak! Tell me sister.
[33:09] Don't you feel good staying with us?
[33:13] Don't you feel respected when you stay in such a big house and travel in such luxurious cars?
[33:21] You feel good, right?
[33:26] Sheena please!
[33:28] Let me talk.
[33:29] This is not the way to talk!
[33:37] No Safdar! Let her speak.
[33:41] You are right! But Sheena
[33:44] Me and my kids will never forget the favors of Safdar!
[33:52] Why didn't you speak about this before?
[33:57] Only Safdar was happy with this proposal before.
[34:05] And Natasha also didn't agree with this proposal.
[34:11] Now that Natasha... Forgive me Safdar!
[34:17] But I'm forcefully saying this. My son Raazi is in front of you guys.
[34:31] You tell me yourself! Will your divorced daughter bring any good to my son?
[35:02] What's with you?
[35:03] What's with her?
[36:09] Rimsha arranged such a boring party!
[36:12] Whatever! A party is a party!
[36:13] Yeah!
[36:18] Who is this? I've never seen him before.
[36:19] What? oh!
[36:22] He wanted to meet you!
[36:26] Me?
[36:27] Yes you! He wanted some business tips from you.
[36:33] Who is he?
[36:35] He is a proper builder in Dubai. He has his own tower there.
[36:42] He wants to open a Pakistani cuisine based restaurant there. That's why he needs some suggestions. So I thought about uncle.
[36:51] So!
[36:52] Do you think your father will be interested in expanding his business in Dubai?
[36:58] Why would father open another one? He already owns a restaurant in Dubai. It's also a Pakistani cuisine.
[37:06] So! Why don't you open your own business? A separate restaurant for yourself!
[37:14] Are you kidding me? How can I? I don't have the capital or any experience.
[37:20] Faizan! Come on. Leave the capital and experience out of it. Don't underestimate yourself.
[37:28] Do you remember that sometime ago we went to a plaza and there was a restaurant and you helped that restaurant's staff with pointing out the flaws.
[37:41] Why they had less customers, you pointed it all out. I was very impressed by your knowledge about restaurants.
[37:45] Fine! But criticizing and giving opinions is easy but opening a proper restaurant is something different.
[37:52] If you ask me, you should think about your separate business.
[37:57] That is my opinion for you. But for now, share your expert advice with Saliq here as he is ready.
[38:05] Everything is ready but he is only looking for an experienced guy!
[38:11] I'm not interested yet!
[38:13] What is wrong with you Faizan? Why are you letting an opportunity slide?
[38:21] Try to think like a progressive man.
[38:26] And he might pay you for your expert advice.
[38:33] What do you mean?
[38:35] I mean he is a professional man! He is rich too!
[38:41] You might even mind but
[38:45] He can buy your father's restaurants just like that.
[38:51] But I know you feel uncomfortable right now. Let's leave it! Forget about it.
[39:03] Let's meet him!
[39:06] This is what I'm talking about.
[39:09] You are always jealous of me! Come.
[39:16] Saliq! let me introduce you to someone.
