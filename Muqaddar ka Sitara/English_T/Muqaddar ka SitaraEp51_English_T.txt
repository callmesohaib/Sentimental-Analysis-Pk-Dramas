[01:16] sister, you haven't sent the breakfast to Farwa
[01:19] thank God that you don't follow this tradition
[01:22] Sheena, we do follow this tradition
[01:25] Safder, do you remember?
[01:26] we had waited for Sheena's family for an entire day when you guys got married
[01:33] I remember it very well, sister
[01:36] when mom had called it was almost 1:30 PM, the afternoon prayers time
[01:40] upon calling we got to know that they don't know about this ritual, nor Sheena was aware of it
[01:46] but we should keep such traditions alive
[01:52] dad, will you bring breakfast for me?
[01:56] I will like it a lot
[01:59] what! will we bring breakfast from ground floor to first floor?
[02:04] I wanted to discuss something important with you all
[02:08] yes sister, please tell us
[02:11] actually, we want to shift from here with Natasha after the wedding
[02:21] but sister, I was thinking to get the upper portion renovated
[02:28] that's fine Safder, but.. 
[02:30] Razi doesn't want to live in this house as a live-in son in law
[02:36] we have such a big house, and you people have been living here so comfortably till now
[02:42] in fact, now I wanted Natasha to stay in front of our eyes
[02:45] and now you guys have taken this decision!
[02:48] because now I am getting married to Natasha
[02:54] if I would have got married to someone else then
[02:59] I would have stayed here
[03:02] now when... 
[03:04] I am getting married to Natasha, so i don't want to live here as a live-in son in law
[03:14] its a good thing, I don't have an objection on your decision
[03:19] then start looking for some nice house
[03:23] no uncle
[03:25] I've seen a house, in fact
[03:27] I've bought a house with my savings
[03:33] I've done advance payment, as soon as I will get the possession I will get it renovated
[03:37] Wow! you've done all of this & we didn't get to know
[03:49] aunt look, this matter is just one week old
[03:52] and second thing is that I... 
[03:56] I had to sell my father's land
[03:59] and I've to buy a new house after selling it off
[04:03] I didn't wanted to tell uncle
[04:07] because I know
[04:09] if I will tell uncle then he will buy me a house with his money
[04:14] and I didn't wanted this at all
[04:18] I wanted to buy my new house with my hard earned money
[04:25] I don't know whether that house is big or small
[04:30] whether Natasha will be able to stay happy over there or no
[04:33] I don't know that even
[04:36] whatever I could do as per my status for my family & their future
[04:42] I've done, rest is God's will
[04:47] you are right, dear
[04:50] it doesn't make any difference if the house is big or small
[04:54] and... one should always maintain their self respect
[04:59] a woman feels so happy where her man gives her respect, love.. 
[05:06] and protection
[05:08] I am happy & proud of your thinking
[05:14] and Razi
[05:16] even I don't have an objection
[05:19] it doesn't make any difference to me if the house is big or small
[05:23] for me your companionship is more important
[05:26] I am also really proud of you
[05:31] stay blessed my dear
[06:28] yes Mr. Safder tell me
[06:30] your entire property is divided in both of your children name at 40% each as per your will 
[06:37] and balance 20% will be given to your wife
[06:44] now tell me if you want to get any changes made in it
[06:53] yes absolutely!
[06:55] I wanted to make changes & also wanted to add two more names
[07:01] Sir, why not?
[07:03] just tell me who will be those two names
[07:09] one will be my daughter in law Hadia's name & the other one will be my nephew
[07:13] Razi
[07:18] now you have to make the pattern
[07:21] its obvious, gradually
[07:23] Faizan, Natasha, my wife, then my daughter in law Hadia
[07:27] and in the end my nephew Razi
[07:31] take out the percentage, show me the details then I will give you an approval
[07:35] it will be done, sir
[07:37] I will come to you with all the documentations & calculations
[07:46] get this work done as soon as possible
[07:48] don't worry, I will meet you soon. Bye!
[07:51] bye!
[08:24] what happen Faizan, why are you so angry?
[08:26] do you know what dad did? He is being so unfair right now
[08:30] No, I will get to know if you will tell me
[08:33] he has reduced your shares & named them after Razi & Hadia
[08:36] he has transferred the factory as well in Razi's name
[08:38] what! what are you saying?
[08:40] yes!
[08:42] I mean, how can he do this?
[08:43] we have the right on his each & everything, whether its his property or business
[08:47] how can he snatch our right & give it to a third person?
[08:50] I don't believe it that Safder can do this
[08:52] how he did such a big stupidity!
[08:55] I don't know
[08:57] he had always given priority to Razi
[09:00] please talk to him, if you cannot then tell me I will talk. I will fight for my right
[09:04] but I won't let my right go to someone else
[09:07] Ok relax, the work won't be done by fighting
[09:11] I will talk to your dad
[09:14] I cannot see Razi next to me, as he is not equivalent to me
[09:22] talk to him, Ok?
[09:23] yes, I will talk to him once he comes back from office
[10:03] do you need something?
[10:06] No, how can I bother you? You are not well yourself
[10:10] hey! I am not sick
[10:13] Besides, doctors don't stop you to do work in this condition
[10:18] do you know
[10:20] I was so happy to hear about your marriage but...
[10:23] now I've become sad
[10:25] but why?
[10:27] because earlier you used to live here
[10:29] and now you won't
[10:33] but still I am so happy
[10:37] I think, I can stay happy anywhere with Razi
[10:44] you've started to love him that much?
[10:46] yes
[10:49] honestly, I didn't get to know that when have I started to love him so much
[10:59] Hadia, I wanted to say sorry to you
[11:05] to me? why?
[11:08] actuality whatever Faizan had said about you & Razi
[11:15] I thought, Faizan won't say a thing after hearing about mine & Razi's wedding. But still he had said it
[11:22] I'm really sorry
[11:26] even I had thought the same, but..
[11:30] what can we do
[11:33] God willing, everything will be fine
[11:37] I am just waiting for good times
[11:40] anyways, leave it
[11:42] get well soon, so that we can start your wedding preparations
[11:46] we'll do the shopping together
[11:48] what kind of dress will you buy?
[11:50] I was thinking to buy something of Razi's choice
[11:56] but you also give your opinion, it will matter a lot
[12:01] No, I think you should buy the dress of his choice
[12:04] this will be good
[12:08] Hadia, if you don't mind then can I ask you a question?
[12:16] where is Fizza, & what is she doing?
[12:19] what's there to mind, you can ask me
[12:22] Fizza has taken an admission in another medical college
[12:26] oh! that's a good thing
[12:30] honestly! whatever happened with her. I'm pretty sure, she hadn't done anything wrong
[12:36] true that!
[12:47] Safder, I don't understand what have you done!
[12:51] what?
[12:53] you've given 5% shares to Razi from our business
[12:57] he isn't capable to get a towel factory as a wedding gift
[13:00] you've handover an entire business to him
[13:03] ok fine! but what was your motive while giving 5% of shares from our business?
[13:09] what are you trying to prove?
[13:11] what was my motive?
[13:13] what am I trying to prove?
[13:15] Sheena, you know it very well that I've always given importance to my children decisions
[13:20] and I don't like it if anyone explains anything to me!
[13:24] I've the right to make a decision for them, whatever I think is better for them I will do that Sheena
[13:28] their good or bad. What needs to be decided for them, nobody knows this better than me
[13:33] No Safder
[13:35] you need to tell me the reason behind giving preference to Razi over Faizan
[13:40] do you know, he is quite hurt. He had felt this a lot
[13:44] why is he feeling it? Which preference?
[13:47] whatever I have is of Faizan's after me
[13:50] that's right
[13:51] but give him some rights at least
[13:54] you've made him sit on an ordinary position in your office
[13:57] I mean, he is your son. Safder Kamal the CEO's son
[14:01] really! do you know the meaning of a big seat?
[14:04] big responsibilities & big decisions!
[14:07] your son isn't that capable yet
[14:10] ok fine, my son is not capable as per your thinking
[14:15] but at least transfer something on his name
[14:17] so that he can feel secure & confident
[14:20] this way, not only he will become suspicious from Hadia & Razi but with his sister too
[14:25] then explain him, Sheena
[14:27] what comparison does he have with Razi?
[14:31] he is my nephew
[14:33] he is Natasha's to be husband, ours to be son in law
[14:38] whatever we will give to Razi, eventually our daughter will get it
[14:42] he will be just the care taker, why don't you guys get it?
[14:46] Ok fine! I accept whatever you are saying
[14:50] tell me one thing, what was your motive in giving 10% to Hadia?
[14:55] you've given 10% to her from our shares, why?
[15:00] I've given nobody's share to anyone
[15:03] whatever is written in whomsoever fate, he will get it
[15:06] no injustice is being done with anyone
[15:08] please!
[15:45] Ok tell me what are the delivery reports
[15:50] Sir, Mr. Razi had asked me to stop them
[15:53] Razi had asked you to stop?
[15:55] yes sir
[15:57] but why?
[15:58] Sir, I don't know. I had asked him but he scolded me & asked me to be quiet
[16:02] and told me to stay away from this matter & mind my own business
[16:07] but you should have asked the reason
[16:09] Sir, I couldn't gather courage
[16:11] then Mr. Faizan asked me not to take tension, he will get it delivered himself
[16:16] and he will talk to Mr. Razi himself
[16:19] had Faizan said this to you?
[16:21] yes sir, now he has started to give time to office
[16:25] and... last night he stayed here till 9 PM
[16:28] if he wants to know or discuss something then he talks to me
[16:33] and sir, now he has started to take office work at home
[16:38] its such a good thing
[16:40] Ok send Razi to my room
[16:42] Sir, Mr. Razi is not in the office
[16:45] if not, then where is he?
[16:46] Sir, I don't know. And now he stays outside the office for quite a long time
[16:52] No, no... I know where he must have gone
[16:55] nowadays the construction is going on in his house, so he must be there
[16:59] anyways, look into it. I'll talk to you later
[17:02] yes sir
thank you!
[18:15] yes!
[18:17] No, there is no problem. Fix my meeting with Salik
[18:22] yes, I don't have that much amount in my account as of yet
[18:25] whatever I have, if I will take them out then my father will get to know & it will be a problem for me
[18:32] Ok, I was thinking that.. .
[18:35] we shall sell the food factory
[18:38] it will be sold in a good amount
[18:42] Ok fine
[18:45] yes, Okay... do sort the meeting too
[18:51] Okay bye!
[19:00] you are selling your dad's factory
[19:07] how can you stoop so low?
[19:10] cheating with your own father
[19:15] why?
[19:19] you haven't left your habit of eavesdropping
[19:21] I don't eavesdrop but you talk secretly
[19:25] and the work which is done secretly are wrong & gives loss
[19:29] I won't listen to your lectures, Hadia
[19:31] first of all tell me
[19:34] that why are you selling dad's factory?
[19:36] had he transferred on your name so that you shall sell it off?
[19:39] why are you interfering in my personal matters?
[19:42] and you've heard it wrong, I'm not selling the factory
[19:46] I've heard everything correct
[19:48] you cannot deny me
[19:50] what do you know about business that you are saying so much!
[19:54] dad should be aware of it that what you are doing behind his back
[19:59] I won't let you do this
[20:02] Okay, I am selling the factory
[20:05] not secretly, but after seeking his permission
[20:06] I am selling it off as per his suggestion & advice
[20:09] I mean, I sit with him in the business & i won't do anything without his permission
[20:14] but the problem is that you've always underestimated me
[20:18] you think I don't know work
[20:20] only Razi knows how to work
[20:23] dad trusts me
[20:25] but why am I talking about trust with you?
[20:29] its written on your face that you are lying
[20:33] think whatever you want to
[21:27] think once again
[21:29] she won't tell
[21:31] she hadn't told anything to dad prior to this
[21:33] man..
[21:36] the way you are black mailing your wife
[21:40] she can black mail you too
[21:45] she is not like me
[21:47] I'm telling you
[21:48] she won't tell
[21:54] Faizi, there is a possibility that you are underestimating your wife
[21:59] what if you stay in this mind set
[22:02] right?
 and our plan gets ruined
[22:07] I made a mistake, I shouldn't have talked in her presence
[22:09] and I have no clue what to do now. Tell me, what to do?
[22:15] look, there is a solution by which we can rectify your mistake
[22:21] but...
[22:23] listen
I'm listening
[22:25] first of all you need to focus on your wife 100%
[22:29] fix your relationship with your wife, awake your old love
[22:35] Okay?
[22:37] focus on her
[22:40] I don't know
[22:43] Okay let me try doing that too, but I don't know
[22:46] Faizi look! till the time your relation won't normalize with your wife
[22:52] till then, we cannot move to the next step of the plan
[22:57] I hope the factory matter also gets solved
[22:59] it will be solved too, I have talked to a few people
[23:03] we'll get an answer within few days
[23:05] Ok, when do we have to meet Salik?
[23:07] Salik?... let me align the meeting with him for tomorrow or day after. Don't worry
[23:13] hopefully till then the property will be transferred & I'll get the money as well
[23:16] remove this property matter from your mind
[23:20] your 100% focus should be on your wife right now, ok?
[23:24] if your relationship didn't normalize again
[23:27] then the property, factory won't matter. This wealth won't matter as well
[23:34] don't know how things gets so messed up & I don't understand
[23:37] that's life man! you know that
[23:44] Safder is giving a towel factory to Razi as a wedding gift
[23:49] what!
[23:50] don't you know?
[23:53] oh sister..
[23:55] you seem quite worried
[23:58] I thought you will be so happy
[24:01] as you will become a millionaire over night
[24:06] I wasn't expecting this reaction from you
[24:11] ok sister, tell me
[24:13] my daughter who is making you a millionaire over night
[24:18] what objection does Razi have while marrying her?
[24:22] what was the reason?
[24:25] No Sheena
[24:28] there isn't any such thing
[24:31] ok leave it
[24:33] I am thinking, why not we shall start wedding preparations?
[24:38] what do you think?
[24:41] yes
[24:43] Okay, as you wish
[24:48] Ok tell me
[24:50] what are you giving Natasha as a wedding gift?
[24:55] what?
[24:56] I think, the new bungalow that Razi has made
[25:03] you will give that to her as a wedding gift, right?
[25:12] this...
[25:13] will you talk to Razi?
[25:25] yes, I will talk to him
[25:44] mom, what was the need to demand a house from aunt?
[25:49] why? what's wrong in it?
[25:54] since she is getting a lot because of you
[25:58] So, can't they transfer the ownership of an ordinary house on your name?
[26:01] mom, dad had already transferred so many things on my name
[26:04] that's enough for me!
[26:06] leave it
[26:08] when Safder can transfer the entire factory on his name, then can't he transfer a house on your name?
[26:14] mom, Razi had made that house with a lot of hard work & love
[26:17] how will he transfer its ownership on my name?
[26:19] if he won't, then I will ensure that he does that
[26:22] mom please!
[26:24] Razi is my to be husband
[26:27] please don't do any such thing that he shall gets upset with me
[26:30] look! a wife has got her right on her husband's things
[26:35] and if you signify this right then you aren't doing any crime
[26:40] mom, but what will Razi think about us?
[26:44] that doesn't matter, I will handle that
[26:46] there is no need for you to worry about it, Ok?
[26:50] you are the only daughter of Safder Kamal
[26:53] the heir of millions
[26:57] if he can change his status by marrying you
[27:01] then you can also signify your right on his property
[27:04] mom, please try to understand
[27:07] I truly love Razi
[27:10] and all of these things doesn't hold any value for me
[27:13] please call aunt & tell her that we don't have any such demand
[27:19] Never!
[27:20] I won't do any such thing, understand?
[27:24] and look! stay away from all of these things
[27:28] I will do all of this & I will ensure to get it done
[27:30] just focus on your wedding preparations, understand!
[27:34] no go from here!
[27:46] mom, I've got no interest in his factory
[27:50] but he is giving it to you as a wedding gift
[27:54] factory in the wedding gift!
[27:56] mom, the business worth millions of rupees
[27:59] who gives such an expensive gift in the wedding?
[28:06] I don't know about anyone else
[28:08] but he is your uncle "Safder"
[28:16] whatever happens
[28:20] I don't want it
[28:28] such an expensive gift
[28:31] I cannot take, mom
[28:34] but I don't think so that
[28:36] he is giving it to you
[28:38] he is giving it to his daughter
[28:45] to whomsoever he is giving, still I don't want it
[28:51] everyone will become upset for no reason
[28:59] and your aunt Sheena, she will mind the most
[29:06] by the way...
[29:08] you can try
[29:10] but I don't think so that your uncle will agree
[29:14] whatever he is giving to his daughter is as per his status & happiness
[29:20] Besides, both the kids have their share in his wealth
[29:24] but still I want
[29:29] it would be better if you don't accept this wedding gift
[29:35] otherwise...
[29:39] otherwise?
[29:42] you have to give an expensive wedding gift as well
[29:48] the matter is not that but..
[29:50] will uncle agree if I will refuse?
[29:55] No
[29:57] I don't think so
[30:00] but still
[30:02] then?
[30:07] refuse to take it on the day of marriage
[30:15] mom, its very difficult for me
[30:17] but nothing can be done now
[30:48] hello! Greetings sister, how are you?
[30:52] greetings to you too! how are you doing?
[30:54] how is your new university? Did you make friends?
[30:57] the university is really good
[31:00] and I've made one friend
[31:02] I won't make anymore friends
[31:04] why?
[31:05] because what happened with me last time, after that I am so afraid
[31:10] what's with you?
[31:12] your friends were no nice to you, then why are you thinking like this?
[31:18] yes! the friends were nice
[31:23] but sister, I've decided that after lecture I will
[31:26] straight away go to my room in the hostel and..
[31:30] I won't sit in the cafeteria as well, I won't make any friends
[31:33] I've made Hafsa my friend just because
[31:37] she is my roommate
[31:38] hey! what happen to you Fizza?
[31:40] have you gone mad?
[31:43] you are my such a wise sister, I hadn't expected this from you
[31:48] sister please
[31:51] don't force me, in fact be my strength & courage
[31:56] whatever happened in the past, I cannot face it again
[32:00] but who told you that all of this will happen with you once again?
[32:03] even earlier nobody had told me
[32:06] still I had to face a lot of insult & humiliation
[32:10] Besides, don't discuss anything with mom & dad
[32:14] I've told brother Razi about Fawad
[32:16] what! Fizza!
[32:18] sister please!
[32:20] please don't tell this to mom & dad
[32:23] I want to know that why he did all of this to me
[32:27] what was the reason behind it
[32:30] he has ruined my life
[32:32] and I've told brother Razi
[32:36] it would be better to give him strict punishment as much as he can
[32:40] because the torment that he had given me
[32:44] now I won't leave a chance to ruin his career
[32:50] I will talk to you later, bye!
[33:19] Safder uncle has transferred few of his business shares along with a factory in Faizan's name
[33:26] really!
[33:28] a lot is transferred in Faizan's name!
[33:30] yes, you've won a lottery
[33:34] by the way what is my benefit in this? 
Already he spends everything on Hadia
[33:39] No, this is what you think
[33:41] nowadays Faizan & Hadia's relation isn't good
[33:48] if you want
[33:50] then you can take out as much money from him as you want
[33:54] really!
[33:56] but how?
[34:00] I have to tell this as well!
[34:02] call him
[34:06] talk emotional things to him, tell him that you miss him
[34:08] he will come to you running
[34:10] hmm...
[34:12] that's not a bad idea
[34:14] but if he didn't come, then?
[34:17] he will come
[34:20] ok tell me, what other information he gave
[34:24] nothing!
[34:26] besides, nowadays he is spending a lot of time at office in order to come into his dad's good books
[34:32] that's about it
[34:35] and what about Salik's case?
