[01:09] The groom looks very smart and rich.
[01:15] Yes but he doesn't look happy. Look at his mother and sister. They seem upset.
[01:21] Yes, they look arrogant. How will our simple Hadia manage?
[04:12] what! He went for the wedding?
[04:15] Yes even after I tried to make him understand, he went.
[04:19] Our plan failed.
But?
[04:21] But nothing.
Nothing can be done now, Ramsha.
[04:26] And yes, you don't have to come to Pakistan right now.
[04:30] I told him you were critical.
[04:33] But he went ahead with the wedding even knowing that.
[04:35] Yes. He heard that and yet he got married.
[04:39] He's a very obedient son.
No. He isn't obedient.
[04:44] His father is very stubborn. Now you'll have to talk to him.
[04:49] Nothing can be done Ramsha.
[04:52] I've already lied to Faizan to help you. If he finds out he'll boycott me as well.
[05:18] Why are you standing here all alone?
[05:22] Oh wait. I know.
[05:29] What do you mean?
[05:31] You thought dad would throw out Faizan and you'd be in luck.
[05:40] And you'll take the place of his son directly.
[05:45] But you're mistaken.
[05:48] You cannot be his son or his son in law.
[05:52] Understand this!
[05:55] Seriously?
[05:57] Listen,
[05:59] I'm not at all interested in taking Faizan's place.
[06:02] I'm happy in my place and my status
[06:07] and as far as being Safdar uncle's son in law is concerned,
[06:13] take out this misunderstanding out of your mind.
[06:16] Even if you're the only girl in the world, I'll not marry you.
[06:23] You got that?
[07:19] Now what tradition is this?
[07:20] You don't know about it. You'll have to drink this and give us a gift.
[07:30] Take a sip. She's requesting.
[07:39] Faizan take a sip and throw the money on her face.
[07:52] Its just a sip Faizan. You know your dad will be upset.
[08:12] Now happy?
Yes now give us the gift.
[08:15] We will take twenty five thousand in cash.
[08:19] For what?
[08:20] Now this is how the tradition goes?
[08:23] So much money for this milk? Come on..
[08:28] Here take 50 thousand and now don't come back for anything more.
[08:54] What will you get by being angry?
[08:59] How many times did I tell you to stay away from Faizan?
[09:03] You'll not get anything. But you didn't listen to me.
[09:07] No mom. I know Faizan got married because his father pushed him.
[09:12] He wouldn't have gotten married otherwise.
[09:14] Come on Ramsha. Get back in your senses.
[09:19] Had Faizan loved you even a little,
[09:23] he wouldn't have married any other girl.
[09:26] No mom. Faizan still loves me. His friend Zohaib told me.
[09:32] So? When did Zohaib tell the truth? He's a liar himself.
[09:37] He keeps sending you false news.
[09:39] NO mom, Zohaib wouldn't lie to me. He's telling the truth.
[09:45] I'm telling you Faizan got married because of a reason.
[09:50] I will find out what that reason is.
[09:55] Stupid girl.
[12:30] I'm going.
Where?
[12:34] To my friends.
[12:53] Right now? Don't you know?
[12:55] I'm exhausted. I need to relax. I'm going.
[12:58] But...
[12:59] What? I got married. Don't bother me anymore. What else should I do?
[13:05] Sheena, both of you take Hadia inside.
[13:09] Please dad. I'm really tired. I can't.
[13:17] sister Sajida and Farwa, please take Hadia inside
[13:22] and lets get done with everything. If there is any more never ending tradition that needs to be done.
[13:31] Come dear.
I'll show you your room.
[13:37] Come here. Your son doesn't leave any moment to insult me. What face will I show to Aleem?
[13:46] Had there been someone else.
Enough Safdar!
[13:49] didn't you know you forced him to get married.
Faizan got married now what more do you want?
[13:58] Ramsha committed suicide because of Faizan.
[14:07] What do you think? This is something small?
[14:11] Faizan just got married an hour ago.
[14:21] For God's sake give him some space.
[14:25] Even I'm tired. I'm going inside.
[14:49] Mom?
[14:52] Will sister Hadia be treated this way?
[14:57] What can we do?
[15:00] This was a forced marriage.
[15:05] Sheena shouldn't have done this.
[15:11] Safdar has destroyed the life of both these kids because of his own happiness.
[15:17] Not both but three.
[15:19] Enough Farwa. Quiet.
[15:24] Don't say this again.
[15:27] Mom..
[15:29] Enough. Don't argue.
[15:34] Do you even know how dangerous this is?
[15:37] God forbid if someone even gets a hint of it, that girl's life will be destroyed and,
[15:44] even Razi will be accused.
[15:46] And I don't want Safdar to think about it. I won't like it.
[15:52] By the way,
[15:54] my brother would have gotten his love,
[15:58] if only you had said yes.
[16:00] What could have happen if I had said yes?
[16:03] Faizan's mother brought him back with his consent.
[16:07] My Razi would have been hurt even more.
[16:10] At least I didn't lose my pride.
[16:14] And its fine. Whatever happened, happened for the best. My son isn't some lowlife that,
[16:23] Now tell me will you stay awake all night that you're still up.
[16:28] Half of the night has passed. I'll sleep after the morning prayers now.
[16:32] Alright fine.
[18:14] I'm too exhausted, I need to relax, I'm going.
But where?
[18:19] Don't bother me anymore. I got married. What else should I do?
[18:42] You know you forced him to get married and Faizan got married. Now what more do you want?
[18:58] Faizan is disturbed because he was forced to marry me.
[19:03] But why?
[19:51] Hello?
[19:53] How is Ramsha?
[19:56] She was brought out of the ICU just now.
[20:00] What did she do?
[20:02] You're asking me what she did?
You promised you'd marry my daughter.
[20:09] And you married someone else. Now you're asking me what happened to her?
[20:14] You destroyed my daughter's life.
[20:17] Tell me how she is. Make me talk to her.
[20:21] If you're so worried, come here right now and look at her yourself.
[20:28] Remember this,
[20:30] if something happens to my Ramsha, I'll not spare you. I will not.
[20:46] Now see how he comes running.
Good acting.
[24:30] Where is he coming from?
I just got married.
[24:34] What has he done to himself?
[24:43] He's drunk. What has he done to himself?
[24:47] Take him to the other room.
[24:51] Come on sir.
[24:52] In my room.
[24:56] What nonsense is this? I'm warning you. Don't take him to the room where the bride is.
[25:02] You're drunk. I want to..
Sir please. Let it be.
[25:07] Take him away.
Yes sir.
[25:10] Come on sir.
I got married today..
[25:19] I don't understand how will I face that girl.
[25:25] He hasn't left me able to show my face to anyone. Oh God, forgive me.
[25:31] Uncle, don't worry. Everything will be fine.
[25:38] Please go and get some rest. Its very late.
[25:47] Please.
[26:47] Hadia..
[26:51] Hadia..
[26:59] Oh God. What sort of a dream was this?
[27:04] Is my daughter really in trouble right now?
[27:09] Did I make a big mistake marrying her to a bold person like Faizan?
[27:18] No. This cannot be.
[27:22] Safdar promised me that he'll look after my daughter.
[27:29] He will not let her get hurt.
[27:33] Faizan too will change with time.
[27:58] Mom.. these are the sweets.
[28:07] Oh wow. So many things. I was thinking we'd get the breakfast items from Karachi.
[28:15] Maybe they'd like those.
[28:19] They wouldn't need our breakfast and even if we got stuff from Karachi, they'll find faults with it.
[28:25] I'm doing everything for my daughter. She must be waiting for us.
[28:30] If you're done preparing,
[28:34] you should get ready as well.
[28:38] Dear why are you standing here? Get ready.
[28:43] Yes sure, I'll get ready. I send Guddu to get savories for her. Why aren't you ready yet?
[28:49] So you're getting everything your sister liked.
[28:54] Okay, I'll go and get ready.
[28:57] You know we tried to take some good stuff.
[29:01] Mom and I couldn't sleep all night. We were busy making the arrangements for this.
[29:05] Fine dear. Get everything done. Its best if we reach on time, alright?
[29:12] I'll go and change as well.
[29:48] Hadia?
[29:50] Hello.
[29:51] Please sit dear. I came to ask,
[29:58] if you can change we'll have breakfast together
[30:02] and tell me what do you like to eat I'll make that for you.
[30:06] Nothing. Just tea.
[30:10] Fine. I'll ask Farwa to get your clothes. What would you wear dear?
[30:17] Anything.
[30:19] I'll ask Farwa to help you get ready.
[30:25] May you be blessed.
[30:47] Whatever I was afraid of happened.
[30:50] The reason I brought them here from America happened here as well.
[30:56] He wasn't in his room last night.
[30:58] In fact he shouldn't be with Hadia in that condition.
[31:04] What would she think?
[31:07] What if she tells brother Aleem something.
[31:11] I don't want them to know Faizan's reality just now.
[31:17] They will find one day so why not today.
[31:21] What are you saying?
[31:23] Have some fear.
[31:27] You brought someone else's daughter here, at least show her some respect.
[31:32] You and Natasha should have visited her but you didn't.
[31:41] Now tell me what do you want?
[31:44] What is there to say Sheena?
[31:53] Do one thing. Both of you, you and Natasha should go see her and convince her that last night his friend got into an accident.
[32:03] He went there in a hurry and when he got back he got food poisoning.
[32:10] Say anything but she shouldn't find out the truth.
[32:16] Sorry Safdar, I cannot do this.
[32:19] Why can't you?
[32:21] Sheena the place where my children are standing today is because of you
[32:28] because I left their upbringing to you.
[32:32] Both of you should have been there but instead my sister and Farwa took her to her room.
[32:42] Please solve this matter. Go.
[32:47] Go to her room and talk to her. Please I'm asking you.
[32:53] Go please, go to her room before brother Aleem and his wife comes.
[33:16] Wow. You look pretty in simplicity as well.
[33:21] Are you ready?
[33:24] What is this you're wearing?
Does a bride dress like this?
[33:31] You must have brought this from your home, I guessed only looking at it.
[33:34] Have you ever seen a bride look like this?
[33:41] I've never helped a bride get ready. I'll get something from what you brought.
[33:48] Let it be. Her family has already come. They'll be happy no matter how she looks.
[33:56] We'll go see the dining table then.
[34:03] By the way, did you ask them to bring breakfast?
[34:08] I've told them no a hundred times but they dare never listen.
[34:15] Faizan didn't come to his room last night. Even we were worried.
[34:21] But his friend got into an accident and he's still in the ICU.
[34:25] You will not tell this to your family.
[34:29] Good girls don't let their family know what goes on in her in laws.
[34:34] Do you understand or not?
[34:40] Now come downstairs.
[34:58] Its surprising brother Aleem. You didn't stop with the antiquated tradition of getting the bride breakfast.
[35:06] It seems you want your younger daughter to marry into a family like ours.
[35:11] You did all this hard work to bring breakfast and now you'll stay till tonight for the reception.
[35:28] We will be going back.
[35:46] Hadia, go take your mother and Fizza to see your room after breakfast.
[36:05] Please start.
Yes. Sure.
[36:17] I cannot eat all this oily food. I'll take fruits only.
[36:49] Oh wow. You have such a beautiful room.
Praise to the Lord.
[36:55] By the way, your father got this Rosewood furniture made for you on urgent basis.
[37:00] It was a little expensive but do you like it?
[37:05] Do you have to ask? Its very important for me.
[37:10] I'll keep them close to my heart.
[37:13] We shouldn't keep things close to our hearts but relations.
[37:19] Hadia where is Faizan?
[37:25] He is habitual of sleeping in late and so is Natasha, so both of them weren't there for breakfast.
[37:33] But where is he? This is his room right.
[37:41] He went to the other room to sleep when he heard you people were coming so that you wouldn't be disturbed.
[37:47] Dear is everything fine?
[37:56] Let everything be, tell me what did you get as a wedding gift.
[38:00] Fizza!
[38:04] Mom come sit please. Come.
[38:08] brother Aleem I apologize. I'm embarrassed. Please don't mind what Sheena said.
[38:19] No Safdar its nothing. I was just..
She isn't bad at heart.
[38:27] Its just she has a strict attitude. Its best if we ignore her.
[38:38] I can understand Safdar.
[38:42] I wanted to meet Faizan so I could ask how he was feeling.
[38:52] Of course. There's no harm in that but he took medicine and slept.
[39:00] Don't worry. You'll meet him in the event tonight.
[39:06] Of course we'll meet him there.
[39:11] Please call Fizza and Khadijah. Its a long trip back and we need to get some work done.
[39:21] Yes sure. Khaliq? Khaliq
Yes sir?
[39:27] Call Fizza and sister in law, brother Aleem has to get back.
Okay sir..
[39:36] So all arrangements done for the evening?
[39:39] Everything will be done when you come and grace the event with your presence.
[39:44] As God wills.
