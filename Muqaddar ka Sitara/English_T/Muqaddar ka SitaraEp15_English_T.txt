[01:07] How was it?
[01:12] How could it have been possible for us to not celebrate Mona's birthday?
[01:20] Thank you for coming.
[01:24] I will see you...
[01:40] Okay, guys...
[01:50] Sir... how was the party? I hope there wasn't a shortage of anything.
[01:54] No, it was good. Tell me about the sale today.
Sure sir, let me tell you.
[02:02] Sir, today's sale is eighty thousand...
What! Eighty thousand?
[02:06] Sir, because of your party we had to close it to the public, that's why.
[02:12] Tell me about the rest of the branches...
Sure sir...
[02:16] The branches in DHA...
[02:19] are doing well. Up till now, both of them have done a sale of five lacs.
[02:22] That's good... has the money been transferred.
[02:26] Yes sir.
Alright, then send me five lacs.
[02:30] Sir... without Mr. Safdar's permission...
[02:35] Who am I then? Have you forgotten, that I'm his son?
[02:41] It's not that... but I'm not allowed to transfer more than two lacs.
[02:47] For that, I'll need to ask Mr. Safdar or Mr. Razi.
[02:52] Mr. Razi?
[02:56] When did he gain so much respect?
[02:58] He's an employee like you, and he takes a salary from my father.
[03:04] Don't ever say his name so respectfully in front of me again. Go and get me the money.
[03:34] Fizza, it will be very hard for me to talk about it...
[03:36] Why sister? What happened now?
[03:40] Is aunt Shina creating a problem, or did brother Faizan say something?
[03:43] No, it's nothing like that.
[03:47] We're at a farmhouse. We'll spend two days here, so I can't come.
[03:55] You should have told father that when he invited you.
[04:01] actually Faizan's plan wasn't confirmed, that's why I said yes.
Are you sure?
[04:08] That's the truth, right?
[04:11] I don't know why, but I can't believe that's the truth.
[04:17] It's such a happy occasion for me. It will be so upsetting for me if my sister isn't there.
[04:26] Sister, what's the matter? Hello?
[04:41] You didn't do right by my sister at all.
[05:13] Hadia, you're crying?
[05:27] What are you doing here so late at night? Is everything alright?
[05:32] You're here as well, did I ask you anything?
[05:35] No... I came here to walk and...
[05:39] I came here to walk as well...
[05:43] You're crying...
[05:46] This is my personal matter... what's it to you?
[05:54] Did Faizan say something to you?
[06:07] I'm sorry, it's your personal matter.
[06:12] But, I need to talk to you about something important.
[06:14] There's nothing for us to talk about.
[06:23] Hadia, would you like to explain this behavior of yours?
Not at all...
[06:28] When you can do anything, then I don't have to answer anyone as well.
[06:35] What did I do?
Should I tell you that?
[06:38] Wow! You really are unaware!
[06:43] It's better to be unaware than to be disloyal.
[06:52] What are you two doing here alone, at this hour?
[07:00] I came out here to walk and ran into her.
[07:03] She was saying something about a school in Hyderabad.
[07:11] Oh...
[07:13] So you were telling him stories so late at night.
[07:26] It would be better if you keep your stories restricted to yourself.
[07:33] Your family's tales will eventually be revealed to everyone.
[07:39] There is no need to beat a drum about them.
[07:44] You don't even show some restraint to my guests!
[07:52] Excuse me...
Wait, Razi!
[07:59] It would be better if you go to your room.
[08:17] You know that it was not my will...
[08:22] to have you here.
[08:27] Yes... but I also know that I'm here because of my uncle.
[08:32] Not of my own will.
[08:36] I didn't want to come here.
[08:40] I don't care what you would have done and what you wouldn't have done.
[08:44] But listen to something with open ears... I have a daughter at home...
[08:50] And now a daughter-in-law. It would be better if you keep a distance from them...
[08:57] Natasha is like my sister...
[09:01] And Hadia...
[09:06] Hadia is like my sister-in-law.
[09:10] I respect both of them wholeheartedly
[09:14] I live here as well and sometimes we will eventually meet each other.
[09:21] Please, don't make an issue out of this again.
[09:25] If uncle finds out, he will not like it
[09:31] Good night.
[09:57] The small house you come from... isn't it considered bad talking to someone...
[10:04] so late at night?
[10:05] What do you mean? I don't understand.
[10:08] It's very clear what I said.
[10:10] We might have been living in the US. But it was unacceptable to us that a married woman...
[10:18] would talk to a strange man, out on the lawn, so late at night.
[10:23] When her husband wasn't at home.
[10:26] You have it wrong I was just...
[10:28] He's not your brother, your cousin, your brother-in-law, or your friend.
[10:34] The question does arise that why would you talk to him so late at night?
[10:44] There is no need for you to be so informal with Razi.
[10:49] I don't want to see you with Razi ever again, understand?
[11:38] Are you ready?
Yes...
[11:41] Come and have breakfast then.
[11:44] I won't have breakfast today.
Why? It's not that late.
[11:48] Safdar is at home as well.
I don't care if he's home, or not.
[11:55] From now on I won't have breakfast with them.
[11:57] Is everything alright... why are you so angry?
[12:03] Tell me something... is this how we will return uncle's favors? By being humiliated every day?
[12:09] What happened?
[12:12] Why are you so angry? Did someone say something?
[12:16] Are you angry at Faizan?
[12:19] He dare not say anything to me...
[12:21] Then tell me, what happened?
[12:25] You can understand...
[12:27] Aunt's daughter and daughter-in-law's honor is in danger because of me.
[12:30] What are you saying?
[12:34] I'm not saying this, auntie was saying it last night.
[12:39] Why did Shina say something like that?
[12:44] Last night, she saw me and Hadia talking.
[12:48] But what need was there for you to talk to Hadia?
[12:52] Mother, you know what was in my heart for Hadia. She doesn't know that
[12:58] She had no right to say what she said. I have a sister here as well...
[13:03] And Faizan roams around the entire house with no restraint. Did I ever say anything to her?
[13:09] Please...
[13:11] All of this has been mental torture.
[13:14] I don't feel like living here anymore.
[13:20] Do you know.. they are wealthy people...
[13:24] Rich people who live in such big houses have a very small mentality and small hearts.
[13:31] They are very selfish.
[13:34] When they love someone, it's only for their gain.
[13:41] And people like us, who live in humble abodes...
[13:45] we sacrifice our self-respect to pay back the favors that were given to us.
[13:59] Uncle Aleem might have married her daughter here, out of greed for money...
[14:04] but I won't do that.
[14:09] When I marry my sister I won't look at wealth or money...
[14:15] I will only look at honor and respect.
[14:41] Najma...
Yes?
[14:42] Make coffee for me...
Sure...
[14:52] Najma... do what you were doing. I'll make it.
[15:02] Ramsha, I'm warning you... you won't come now.
[15:06] Faizan....
No buts... if you want money, I'll send it to you.
[15:11] No... it's not like that.
Oh, come on!
[15:16] Why are you shy? You never hesitated before.
[15:21] Has father's money ended?
Are you taunting me?
[15:26] No, I'm joking. Tell me if you want it, and I'll send it to you.
[15:32] Faizi, you know I would never have asked you. But I am having a tough time here...
[15:40] My medicines...
[15:45] Did I ask you the reason?
[15:49] I'll send you the money... I can't send much right now...
[15:53] Will five lacs be enough?
[15:57] Alright... whatever is easy for you. Send me a picture of yours...
[16:05] And next time, video chat with me.
[16:10] Alright, I'll video call you next time and...
[16:28] Eavesdropping...
[16:31] Have you no shame?
[16:34] Did your parents not teach you this?
[16:37] I don't like his habit at all.
[16:46] May you like this habit or not... or whether my parents taught me respect or not...
[16:51] answer me this, is what you're doing okay?
[16:55] What do you mean? What am I doing?
Don't you know what you're doing?
[16:59] Is it okay talking to girls on the phone and sending them money, even though you have a wife?
[17:07] You need to shut up Hadia.
[17:10] Whatever I'm doing should be of no interest to you.
[17:19] I'm warning you... from now on, if you eavesdrop on me...
[17:26] then I don't know how I will react, but it will be very bad and it won't be good for you.
[17:54] What?
[17:56] Only five lacs... is that it?
[18:01] He'll send it every month.
[18:08] You are making a low-end deal..
[18:11] You're saying that as if though I only have Faizan...
[18:15] Yes, that's true... but I don't think this will last for long...
[18:21] Look, you're not his employee.... he can forget you, or he might get upset...
[18:28] or something else might happen...
What should I do then?
[18:32] You wasted two crores... and I'm really upset at you for that.
[18:39] For that amount, you could have bought a nice flat in Karachi.
[18:43] There would have been someplace for us to live.
[18:45] I've told you so many times, not to worry about this...
[18:50] Faizan is under my thumb, pray that he marries me soon.
[18:57] Sure... like his father will agree to it.
Who's asking him to agree?
[19:04] For me, Faizan is enough. Once Faizan is mine, then everything he has is mine.
[19:13] That's a nice dream.
[19:16] It can come true if you help me, instead of cursing me.
[19:22] Why would I curse you? I just don't understand your plan.
[19:28] You will understand that soon enough. Just give me some time...
[19:34] I'll force Faizan to do court-marriage...
That's fine...
[19:40] why don't you convince Faizan to make arrangements for us to come back to Karachi?
[19:47] He's asking me not to right now, but soon he will agree to it.
[19:56] What about his wife over there?
[20:01] You're so naive...
[20:03] when I'll become his wife, she won't be anymore.
[20:40] This week Faizan has arranged three buffet parties for his friends.
[20:46] And he also arranged a personal party for his female friend.
[20:55] Which friend?
A friend name Mona. This has all the details.
[21:05] Bills, parties, buffet menu, all of it is there.
[21:10] All of these bills have been paid by our company accounts.
[21:17] He kept doing all this, why didn't you stop him?
[21:24] Yes, uncle, I was unable to stop him.
[21:26] I'm just an employee in this company and he...
[21:31] he is the son of the owner of the restaurant.
[21:35] On top of that, he also took five lac cash from the manager.
[21:39] What?
[21:42] you are sitting here!
[21:46] He must be complaining about me...
[21:48] but that's all he can do. He can't stop me.
[21:51] I'm your son.
[21:56] Razi..
[21:58] From tomorrow, when any one of his friends shows up at the restaurant, you can shove him out. That's my order.
[22:10] He can't stop me...
[22:12] But I can, because I'm your father.
[22:16] I didn't open this restaurant for your friends.
[22:19] This is my restaurant, so what if my friends eat there?
[22:25] Many charities offer food, so ask them to go there.
[22:30] As far as my restaurant is concerned...
[22:32] they will not get even get a glass of water from there.
[22:36] Why did you take five lac rupees from Tajumbul?
[22:42] I took it as my salary...
[22:45] Five lac salary?
[22:48] Do you know how much hard work it takes to earn five lacs?
[22:52] If someone like you works hard all day...
[22:55] in a month you'll only be able to earn ten thousand.
[23:00] Why do you do this to me? Why do you humiliate me? What is this?
[23:06] How much intelligent is he, that you give him so much importance over me...
[23:09] Be respectful...
[23:13] I can't respect him.
[23:15] I will never respect anyone who turns you against me.
[23:19] There is no need for anyone to turn your father against you...
[23:25] Because of that, you're enough.
[23:28] Razi...
[23:31] Uncle...
[23:34] Whatever arrangements you have with Faizan
[23:37] should either be looked at by you or Sarfaraz.
[23:42] Please keep me away from him.
[23:45] Razi... my son wait and listen to me.
[23:57] Uncle...
[24:00] Whenever you call me, I'll be there...
[24:06] but I can't tolerate it if someone talks about my loyalty and respect.
[24:16] I beg you...
[24:22] whatever it is between you two, please sort it out between yourselves.
[24:46] Get out!
[24:49] Father...
[24:51] I said get out!
[26:11] What happened Faizan?
[26:14] Did something happen?
[26:26] I don't know when will Safdar will realize that there is a difference between his son and other people.
[26:33] But no... he will never admit it.
[26:41] Don't mind sister...
[26:43] but you won't like it if your son is dealt with unfairly.
[26:49] Tell your son to take it easy, it's not his father's business, it's Faizan's father's business.
[27:04] Eat.
[28:05] How much longer will you stay angry at your son because of your nephew?
[28:09] There is no need for anybody else to make me angry at him.
[28:13] He's sufficient to do that for himself.
[28:16] He's so arrogant and disrespectful. He respects no one... even though...
[28:22] he doesn't have a single talent.
[28:33] He will learn with time.
[28:38] When will that time come?
[28:41] He's not a school-going kid, he's a married man.
[28:46] He knows how to waste money.
[28:50] He knows how to be rude to people and he knows how to use his father's ATM.
[28:56] What he doesn't know is, how to work.
[28:59] I know very well why you and your son are jealous of Razi.
[29:05] It's because he works 12 hours a day.
[29:09] He wants to achieve something in life. He knows how to grow a business.
[29:14] The restaurant is making great strides because of him, can your son do that?
[29:22] Tea...
[29:28] Did you talk to brother Rehman?
No.
[29:35] I think we should go to their home, after all, they came here unannounced.
[29:42] I'm a father of a daughter.
[29:45] I've already expressed my wishes using words in disguise, only on your says-so.
[29:53] There was a reason for their surprise visit to our home...
[29:58] They wanted to see the environment of our house, and what did they see?
[30:03] Our daughter's ill-mannered behavior.
[30:06] Don't expect them to come back here.
[30:12] What did Natasha do?
[30:15] This is how all girls her age are...
[30:20] Those old-fashioned days of parading a trolley are finished.
[30:23] You need to take their thought out of your head.
[30:27] I don't want to be embarrassed in front of them again.
[30:29] If you want you can talk to a marriage bureau. Maybe they'll find a good relationship for our daughter.
[30:36] A marriage bureau is out of the question.
[30:39] It's hard to find good proposals in Pakistan.
[30:43] And... I will not marry my daughter to just anyone. They should match my daughter's worth.
[30:49] If a girl like Hadia can find a family like ours, then why not our daughter?
[31:00] It's hard for me to explain things to you. Please let me read.
[31:18] Brother Safdar is very nice, but I didn't enjoy meeting his family.
[31:24] Especially his wife and daughter.
[31:26] You're right, I felt that too.
[31:30] They are too liberal.
[31:32] It's obvious. They spent all their life in America.
[31:37] That's no excuse.
[31:39] We lived in Europe for ten years, but our daughter didn't become like them.
[31:44] I have always maintained a standard of your family culture and etiquette.
[31:49] To this day their in-laws have never complained about them.
[31:55] We have to find a daughter-in-law from this circle.
[31:58] And then... not everyone would have raised their daughters like us.
[32:03] You'll have to compromise on that.
[32:05] Out of the question...
[32:07] the girl I've brought for Sufyan from this circle...
[32:11] was a terrible decision.
[32:14] That girl paid no heed to us and took Sufyan to California.
[32:20] Let me tell you, I will find Nisar a good girl who will be like a daughter to me.
[32:25] I don't care if she belongs to a middle-class family.
[32:30] You might not have any objections, but your son might.
No, dad.
[32:35] I have no issues with it.
[32:37] Yes son, but we have to move with this society.
[32:41] And people will talk if we take this decision.
[32:47] To move forward we need to move with society.
[32:50] Dad, I don't believe all that. All I want is an innocent girl, who is respectful.
[32:57] It's better for me because I'm a doctor.
[32:59] It doesn't matter if they are middle class, all that matter is that they are honorable
[33:05] By God's good grace, my son's thinking is just like mine.
[33:11] What can I do if you two agree? Find a simple girl for her then.
[33:17] I don't want to find a simpleton for him. I want her to be educated and from a good family.
[33:24] Did you see brother Safdar's daughter-in-law's younger sister? How did you like her?
[33:30] Her... the one who is Safdar's friend's daughter.
[33:36] I liked her a lot.
[33:40] She was very mannered.
[33:43] Safdar's daughter-in-law is very nice as well. I hope her younger sister is like her.
[33:48] Alright, tell him that she topped her Fsc.
[33:55] Nisar... if you don't have any objections should we talk to them about it.
[34:00] If you guys don't mind, then I don't have any objections.
[34:03] Make sure you tell them that we will marry after two years.
[34:08] Sure... they won't be in a rush. It will take her at least four years to complete her medical.
[34:15] Yes but, we can finalize things.
[34:18] Whatever you guys think is best.
[34:21] Then talk to brother Safdar...
[34:25] Wait for now. It's not appropriate to talk to Safdar right now.
[34:29] He's already mentioned his daughter to me...
[34:35] God forbid I make his daughter my daughter-in-law. Out of the question!
[34:43] But, for everything there is time. Give me some time.
[34:48] We'll talk about it.
[34:59] Yes, come in.
[35:03] Uncle, these are some samples...
[35:10] Very nice...
[35:16] Razi, listen I won't be able to go to Malaysia.
[35:20]  I was thinking of sending you to my place.
[35:26] Uncle... me?
[35:29] Yes, you. What's so wrong with it?
[35:33] You have all the capabilities and you can handle the entire delegation.
[35:40] Yes but... it's such a large project and...
[35:46] I told you, son...
[35:49]  I have no doubts about your intelligence and your capabilities.
[35:57] I won't let you down.
[36:01] Bless you.
[36:05] Thank you.
[36:16] So what if he's going to Malaysia? Let him go...
[36:20] You don't understand. It's my right for me to go there.
[36:24] I should be the one to represent my father's company. As the son of the CEO, I should have been the one to lead that delegation.
[36:33] You're right... 
[36:35] but I don't understand what magic he and his mother did on your father.
[36:40] He doesn't listen to me or understand me. He just doesn't want to listen.
[36:46] I don't care. 
[36:48] Please... talk to him. Make him understand, tell him this is my right. I need to go there.
[36:54] Faizan, I'm sorry, I can't. You have to convince your father. 
[36:59] I can't be your lawyer every time.
[37:03] Seriously?
[37:43] Did I disturb you?
[37:46] What is the matter?
[37:50] I am very very sorry father.
[37:59] I'm ashamed.
[38:02] I want to ask for forgiveness.
[38:14] What are you ashamed of?
[38:17] Why are you asking for forgiveness?
For everything...
[38:21] that has hurt you.
[38:27] Father, I want to be the man you want me to become.
[38:34] Please...
[38:37] Please, forgive me.
[38:41] If you want me to become Razi, then I will. 
[38:43] But please, I need you to forgive me.
[38:46] I will learn from him.
[38:54] Just trust me. 
[38:57] Give me some responsibilities, and I promise I won't let you down.
[39:02] I will meet all of your expectations.
[39:08] Please, father, forgive me.
[39:13] Give me one chance.
[39:19] Involve me in your meetings and business. 
[39:22] I'm not saying I'll learn everything in a single day. Maybe I won't be able to provide any input at first, but I'll learn.
[39:29] I want to learn. And I will learn.
[39:36] I will become your ideal son.
[39:41] I will become like Razi.
[39:47] I will conduct all meetings and deals with your foreign clients as well.
[39:54] Father, have you forgiven me?
[40:02] I may make many mistakes in the beginning. But a man learns from his mistakes.
[40:11] And with your guidance and your trust, I will learn to manage those mistakes.
[40:18] Please trust me.
[40:23] If you think it's right... you can send me in your place.
[40:29] Alright...
[40:33] Prepare to go to Malaysia. 
[40:35] And Hadia will go with you.
