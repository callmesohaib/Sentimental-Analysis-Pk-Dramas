[01:24] What is the matter?
[01:28] Mother has refused. You can eat easily
[01:37] They will pressurize you now and you will remember his favors.
[01:41] I won't do anything like that. I hold your happiness dearer than anything in this world.
[01:47] When Natasha isn't agreeing to this proposal, then there is no point in me agreeing to this.
[01:52] If she doesn't agree today, she will agree to it someday.
[01:56] Uncle will surely pressurize her and if she agrees...
[02:01] then you won't be able to reject uncle.
[02:08] Mother you should have stated things from the beginning.
[02:11] You should have told him that I only love Hadia, and I'll only marry her.
[02:14] I didn't think it was appropriate to take Hadia's name at that moment.
[02:18] Now that he knows that you like another girl, we don't need to say anything else.
[02:24] After a few days, I'll take your proposal there.
[02:28] God willing, everything will be alright. Don't worry and eat.
[02:35] No mother, I don't feel like it.
Brother!
[03:12] Mother, where were you? You took so long over there.
[03:17] I went there to take care of things for you.
You should know that these things take time.
[03:23] Anyways, I'm sure you announced my decision to them.
[03:27] Of course, that's why I went there. I won't make that man my brother-in-law.
[03:32] Thank God that you care for my feeling, otherwise father left no stone unturned in hurting me.
[03:40] Sister said that he likes someone else and that she'd be taking his proposal for her very soon.
[03:45] I don't care who he likes, but at least I'm not marrying him now.
[03:51] Thank God. This is my final decision, and I'm adamant. You can tell father that.
[03:58] Ask father to give me my phone back, I want to talk to David.
[04:03] Be patient, otherwise, you'll ruin a set game.
[04:07] Mother, I haven't talked to him since morning. I've been missing since morning, and he'll be upset because of it.
[04:14] Natasha, please be patient and don't get reckless.
[04:33] Mother, you're still up?
What else am I supposed to do when you stay out till late?
[04:39] How can I fall asleep when you're out?
Which movie are you watching?
[04:44] What do you care? Go and enjoy your parties, whilst your mother gets bored at home.
[04:51] Who's asking to get bored at home, you can attend parties as well.
[04:58] I won't like going to parties at my age.
[05:01] Firstly, stop thinking that you're old mother.
[05:06] Alright, what else should I do then?
[05:12] You should attend parties and enjoy yourself.
[05:17] Don't make fun of what I say. I've been feeling bored for ages.
[05:22] I'm tired of watching TV all day.
[05:27] Ever since you brought me to Dubai, you don't give me any time. You've left me at home alone all day.
[05:33] I was better off in Karachi, I had friends there and I could go out.
[05:38] But here, I have no one. You have entrapped me here.
[05:44] If I keep going out like you, then the two crores I received from Safder Kamal will be gone in two days.
[05:51] One thing that upsets me is that it's hard to find simple men like Faizan nowadays.
[05:57] You should have married him, but you listened to his father.
[06:03] For two crores you threw such a good opportunity away.
Don't worry mother...
[06:10] There are many men like Faizan who are around me all day.
Then find one to marry.
[06:17] As soon as you start to age, all of them will leave you. Then what will you do?
[06:23] Mother, until then I would have accumulated a lot and my old age will be comfortable.
[06:30] All you do is talk, one day you will regret remembering my words, you'll see.
[06:36] To tell you the truth I'm upset that you left a man like Faizan.
I didn't leave him.
[06:42] Soon we'll go back to Pakistan...
[06:45] What are you saying? You made a deal with his father, that you won't contact Faizan, nor will you go back to Pakistan.
[06:55] Then how can we go back to Pakistan?
Indeed I did promise that.
[06:59] But I didn't sign any contract. I won't accept it when we go to Pakistan.
[07:05] What does Safdar Kamal have as proof?
[07:17] At least have dinner before you leave, you've been here after ages.
No, I'm not at all hungry.
[07:23] Auntie, I've made your favorite mince and potatoes.
[07:29] No, my friends have kept a get-together, and I'll have dinner with them.
[07:35] Besides, I don't like mince and potatoes. I grow tired of eating our cultural cuisine.
[07:41] I don't know why Safdar brought us back to Pakistan. I don't know what he sees.
[07:48] I don't understand it at all. I'll get going then.
Alright then... let me escort you out.
[08:13] Mother...
[08:19] Why are you still awake?
[08:22] No, I was just about to go to sleep. I was sitting here...
[08:28] Mother... you look worried. Tell me what you're thinking.
[08:34] No, my dear, it's nothing.
[08:38] I'm Razi...
[08:41] Won't you tell me?
My son...
[08:45] It's nothing like that. You know your aunt, Shina...
[08:50] I'm angry at her. Her thinking still hasn't changed.
[08:55] She's still bitter and she still has that attitude.
[08:59] You know her nature very well.
[09:02] She will never change.
[09:06] I have a request, please don't marry me to Natasha.
[09:11] Please...
[09:12] I know that... but I'm worried about your uncle. I don't want to upset him.
[09:25] No mother...
[09:27] I can't accept anyone else but Hadia
[10:17] Pick up your stuff and come with me.
[10:22] Sorry...
[10:27] I won't go to a place where I don't have any respect.
[10:30] I won't go to a place that doesn't care about what I like or not.
[10:34] Alright, stay here then.
[10:37] But don't forget that this is a hotel. You won't be able to live here for long.
[10:42] You don't have a single penny.
[10:45] You'll have to do all kinds of odd jobs, are you willing to do that?
[10:55] You seem very relaxed. Has father agreed to marry you to David?
[11:00] Well, he hasn't agreed yet... but he will agree soon.
[11:08] How?
[11:10] Not now, but I will make him agree.
[11:13] What will you do that will make him agree?
[11:21] Leave that to me, if you trust me.
[11:26] Please don't confuse me, and tell me what you can do for me.
[11:30] Because I don't want to marry a school teacher.
[11:33] I don't want my only, prince of a son, to marry that village girl.
[11:39] But remember, I can't marry you to Ramsha as well.
[11:48] Forget about that now.
If you stay like this...
[11:54] then your father will stay stubborn as well.
[11:57] We need to employ a different strategy for your father to make him happy.
[12:05] I miss her.
[12:08] To make your father happy, marry Hadia.
[12:17] What?
[12:21] How can you say that? You want me to do something, for which I left my home?
[12:27] That can't happen, it's impossible!
What's the matter with you?
[12:32] Alright then.
[12:35] Faizan, listen to me...
[12:38] Hadia is a simple girl. Girls like her are harmless.
[12:45] She'll do whatever you want.
She'll dance at your every whim.
[12:49] She'll sit when you want her to.
She won't say a word to your father.
[12:56] Trust me... you don't need to love her as well.
[13:00] But just to make your father happy, marry her.
Once you take control of the business...
[13:08] then you can do anything you want.
[13:13] No... I won't marry anyone but Ramsha, and that's it.
[13:18] Alright then... when your father removes you from his inheritance...
[13:23] then don't say anything to me.
I don't care.
[13:29] So stupid.
[13:32] Don't you think she and father are making a fool out of the two of us?
[13:35] First, she stopped you and now she's convincing me. I'm sure there's something fishy.
[13:40] Shut up, Faizan! How dare you think something like that.
[13:44] I constantly fight for you two with your father... and this is what you're saying.
[13:51] Alright then...
[13:52] Keep rotting away here!
When your father gives Razi his business...
[13:59] and when that two-bit man removes you from the business...
[14:05] then you'll have nothing left in your hands.
How can he do that?
[14:09] I'm his son, how can he give everything to him?
Does he not care about me?
[14:15] After all the praise he sings for Razi, he can surely do it.
[14:22] If you leave your place, then someone else will take your place.
[14:26] Remember that.
[14:28] Faizan if you think mother is playing a game with us...
[14:34] then you can do what you're doing now.
You can leave home again and come back.
[14:45] Let's go.
[15:27] So you're back from meeting your son.
Don't be so cold, he's your son as well.
[15:34] What's the point of having a son who goes against his father's decision?
[15:39] Life has changed and children have started making their life decisions.
[15:45] It would have been better if you would have understood.
[15:48] If you had, then Faizan wouldn't have been living in that hotel.
[15:52] It would be better if you make him understand, rather than making me understand.
[15:56] A father always does what's best for his children.
[16:02] Let it be Safdar. Your children are disturbed by such words.
[16:08] Shina, you're still trying to make me understand.
[16:11] I brought us all here from America... because I wanted my children close to my religion and culture.
[16:18] If they had stayed here, they would have gotten worse.
We're here, aren't we?
[16:21] We are here because of your stubbornness.
[16:25] But now, let them live their lives according to their will.
[16:30] Otherwise...
Otherwise what?
[16:32] Otherwise, anything can happen.
[16:33] Whatever will happen now...
[16:37] will be according to me.
[16:47] No Safdar, I won't let you do what you want.
[16:52] Never.
[16:55] It's not so good to be so strict with children
[16:59] otherwise, children can get wayward, and maybe let astray.
[17:04] Do you think...
[17:08] that I'm happy to be so strict?
[17:14] It doesn't feel nice being strict with one's children.
[17:17] But the truth can't be hidden.
[17:21] Things have gotten so far, that I can't even tell you.
[17:26] You're my sister, I don't want to hide anything from you. Staying in America...
[17:33] my children haven't adopted a single ounce of goodness.
[17:37] Whatever they have done is bad.
[17:40] It hurts me to tell you this...
[17:43] but my son Faizan has become an addict.
[17:48] And my daughter Natasha...
[17:52] is involved with a foreigner.
[17:56] Now tell me, what else should I have done? I had to bring them back.
[18:05] No matter how hard we try, if a catastrophe has to strike us...
[18:11] then there's nothing we can do. I'm with you on Natasha...
[18:18] she shouldn't marry a person out of our religion.
[18:24] And if Natasha doesn't want to marry Razi...
[18:31] then I think we shouldn't be too hard on her.
[18:35] And then...
[18:39] What can I say...
[18:41] Razi likes some other girl.
[18:44] We should be happy with our children's happiness.
[18:48] Really...
[18:50] Who is that girl?
[18:55] Let me check.
[19:10] You?
[19:12] Greetings*
[19:17] Where's Razi?
[19:20] He's at work right now, he's not at home.
Oh really... then why don't you...
[19:25] call your mother.
Alright sure.
[19:34] What more can I say? I haven't met that girl.
Mother...
[19:41] The landlord is here again... will you come with me?
[19:45] Alright... drink your tea. I'll be right back.
[20:00] Sure brother, we remember. We'll vacate it before the deadline.
[20:04] Alright... only a week is left before the deadline...
[20:09] I decided to make sure you guys remember it.
[20:12] Brother, we remember very well. I told you...
[20:16] God willing, we'll vacate it before you leave.
Alright, I'll get going.
[20:21] Sure... farewell.
[21:02] So much happened and you didn't tell me.
[21:06] It has gone so far that the landlord is visiting your doorstep constantly.
[21:11] Safdar, there is nothing to worry about.
Razi is looking at some options and I am too.
[21:21] What are you saying? There is no need for a rental home...
[21:26] You have your brother's home, you'll shift there.
What! What are you saying?
[21:33] How can we go there? Besides, sister Shina won't like it at all...
[21:39] You have your children and I have mine... all of them will get disturbed.
[21:44] No one will dislike it and no one's privacy will get disturbed.
[21:49] It's good that you said this... I was about to say it to you.
[21:55] Razi is with me, he's looking after my business. He's running my food chain,
[21:59] he'll often return home late.
[22:03] Staying here under these conditions with your daughter...
[22:07] and this area doesn't seem secure to me anymore.
[22:10] Uncle, you're right, this place isn't secure at all.
[22:15] It's often that this place has thefts and on top of that, this place is congested as well.
[22:22] What are you saying? So many people are living here...
Yes, they are...
[22:28] Look... I can't take care of the entire world...
[22:32] but I do care for you two... you two are my family...
[22:38] I can't even think of letting you guys stay here...
[22:40] Razi won't agree at all. Why not buy us a small portion for us in another area?
[22:48] But, for God's sake, don't be so persistent in taking us home.
[22:52] You guys will be alone in a portion as well... I just said...
[22:57] I keep leaving the country because of business... and Razi will be taking care of business...
[23:03] And he won't be able to stay home for long.
[23:05] Add to that the circumstances of the country, and it's not okay for you guys to be alone.
[23:09] This way I'll be satisfied that you guys are in front of me.
[23:14] But...
Listen to me. Don't worry about Razi, I'll convince him. He's a good man.
[23:21] He won't ignore what I say.
[23:24] What should I do?
[23:27] It's hard for me to say no to you.
[23:30] You've already done us so many favors... after Razi's father's demise...
[23:36] you are the one who took care of us.
[23:38] Sister please, don't embarrass me by saying such things. You're like a mother to me.
[23:50] I spent my entire youth...
[23:54] abroad... away from my family...
[23:59] Away from my country.
[24:02] Shina never let me be close to my children
[24:09] To tell you the truth... more than her, I'm the one at fault.
[24:15] I've decided...
[24:19] that...
[24:21] I can't live that machine-like life anymore.
[24:26] I want to...
[24:31] spend the rest of my life with my family.
[24:36] I want all of us to live lovingly under one roof.
[24:40] Together... I request you...
[24:45] Don't refuse... for my happiness.
[25:02] How could you even think of that? How could you do this?
[25:05] This is my home, not a hotel.
[25:09] You can't just bring anyone here. Today it's your sister and someday it will be brother Aleem
[25:14] Try and understand...
[25:15] How can I understand? You took such a big decision without telling me.
[25:22] Why do you want to make my life and my children's life hell?
[25:29] I'm doing this all-purpose and I don't want to argue with you.
[25:34] You know what, I don't even to explain anything to you.
[25:38] If you think you're taking this decision because...
[25:43] it will develop Razi and Natasha's understanding...
[25:48] then you're wrong.
[25:50] I agreed with your decision for Faizan, but I won't do that for Natasha.
[25:58] Please stop them. This is my home and I hold my privacy dear.
[26:03] I would have considered it if it was for a few days... but forever...
[26:09] I won't allow for this at all!
[26:12] I don't need your permission. This house is mine as much as it is yours.
[26:17] I know better than you who should come here and who shouldn't.
[26:22] You're getting angry at me because of them.
[26:24] You're giving them importance over me, I can't believe it.
[26:30] All your life you supported them. You filled their pockets.
[26:36] Now, his son is young... he can take care of his mother and sister.
[26:41] For God's sake, stop raising them!
[26:48] Razi is a smart and educated man.
[26:53] He can become my right hand in the future.
[26:57] He has the will to do a lot of things.
[27:02] He can reach the summit, then I'm sure Natasha would love to marry him.
[27:06] Please... don't be under that illusion. Be honest with each other.
[27:15] You should call spade a spade. Remember that.
[27:33] Why didn't you refuse... I won't go there at all.
[27:38] Ask your sister... I tried stopping Safdar, but he didn't listen to me.
[27:47] Mother's right. Uncle wanted us to live with them.
[27:52] Why did uncle have to come home today? If he hadn't he wouldn't have met that man.
[27:59] In a few days, we would have found a new place.
[28:02] But now uncle knows, we can't stop him now.
[28:07] He wishes for us to live under one roof.
But that's not possible.
[28:16] Uncle has already done us so many favors, on top of that how will we live in one house together?
[28:22] I don't understand this. Please clearly refuse!
[28:26] He's not willing to listen to me.
[28:30] You should leave this to God, and pray that whatever happens is the best for us.
[29:15] Uh...
[29:17] Look who's here.
[29:27] I knew it...
[29:30] you had no other option but to come back...
[29:36] Safdar enough... there is no need to be so cold.
[29:41] It was hard for me to convince him.
[29:44] Now...
[29:47] He won't bother you anymore... he won't talk about marrying that girl...
[29:54] He will help you out in business...
[29:57] And... he has agreed to marry Hadia.
[30:03] What? Really?
[30:07] Good... good my son...
[30:12] Parents can never make bad decisions for their children,
[30:15] as far as Hadia is concerned she's a kind girl.
[30:21] After the marriage, there will be...
[30:25] He will put a shine on our house.
[30:29] I will conduct your marriage with all pageantry.
[30:34] I have a surprise for you as well.
[30:40] I've bought a restaurant for you in a posh place.
[30:47] You will like that place a lot. It's launching next week.
[30:51] You should come with me.
[31:07] I don't understand why you were worried.
[31:11] Uncle... I spent my childhood in that place.
[31:17] All my childhood memories are attached to that place. I spent a lot of time with my father there.
[31:25] That's why that house is very important to me.
You're right...
[31:31] I won't refuse anything you say,
[31:35] but one should walk according to the time one is dealt.
[31:39] A good residence and a better place speak to the time of a person.
[31:47] This way all of you will be in front of me. Besides after Farwa's, my sister won't be alone.
[31:54] You're right... but I think...
[31:59] No buts... what I'm saying is right.
[32:04] Prepare yourself... the car will be there tomorrow...
[32:09] take your stuff and come to your new home.
[32:13] Whatever you think is best.
Bless you.
[32:27] Come... come, my dear... brother Khaliq...
[32:32] Keep this stuff in the two rooms in the corner. Shina will take care of the rest.
[32:37] Alright... from now on this house is your sister.
[32:45] Natasha, your aunt is here, greet her.
[33:02] Where's mother?
[33:05] She must be sleeping.
[33:08] Come here and show Farwa her room.
[33:13] Isn't it enough that you've brought them here?
[33:16] Should I go and take her to her room as well?
[33:19] She can go there herself.
[33:24] You guys go ahead, we'll meet each other at dinner.
[33:32] Alright, Safdar...
Please...
[33:38] Razi...
[33:55] I'm leaving...
[34:13] They're here.
[34:18] All their life, your father took care of their expenses...
[34:21] and now he's sitting on top of our heads!
[34:24] I don't understand... what kind of shameless people are they?
[34:29] On a single offer, they brought all of their stuff here. Father used to praise Razi...
[34:36] but he turned out to be greedy.
[34:40] They have bewitched your father. He prefers them over us.
[34:47] Mother, you should have stopped father.
Do you think I didn't try stopping him?
[34:54] He does what he wants all the time.
[35:01] I think I should do something.
[35:04] Please, don't argue with your father. I don't want him to marry you to Razi...
[35:11] Over my dead body. What's wrong with you? I'm not a coward like Faizan...
[35:18] I will not marry any relative of my father.
[35:22] I'm only silent because of you. If he pressurizes me, I will leave this house!
[35:32] Where are they now?
[35:34] Upstairs... and Razi... he kept staring at me.
[35:40] I don't know what's wrong with father.
[35:43] Where's father...
He left...
[35:50] Did you see their behavior... Natasha didn't even greet us.
[35:56] Aunt Shina didn't come to dinner as well.
[35:59] How can we live in a place like this?
[36:03] I told you so mother... I knew no one would talk to us but uncle.
[36:10] Didn't you see their behavior?
[36:14] That's the problem with mother. Uncle's word is set in stone for her.
[36:22] You talked to Safdar, didn't you?
[36:27] Me saying something is different, it has no value. You're the eldest of our extended family
[36:34] Your decision should have been final.
[36:37] We can't change what happened. Enough...
[36:41] Alright...
[36:43] I'll tell you what will happen now.
[36:46] We'll have to see our self-respect be blown to shreds.
[36:50] Uncle may have brought us here...
[36:55] Soon he'll ask you to tell me to marry her daughter and you'll agree.
[36:59] That won't happen.
[37:01] I've talked to sister Shina... soon I'll go to brother Aleem's house with your proposal.
[37:12] Mother... why don't you go tomorrow?
I can't.
[37:18] Safdar is friends with brother Aleem. If I go there without asking Safdar, he'll be upset.
[37:25] Mother...
[37:27] I think that you should go there now.
[37:31] I'll go there, be patient. I'll go there in a few days.
[37:36] Talk to him today.
I'll talk to him when I see the time is right.
[37:42] I will.
[37:50] Sister, there is everything present in my home.
[37:55] What I don't have are peace and love.
[38:01] That's what I come here to find.
[38:05] This is your home, you can come here anytime you want.
[38:10] We wanted you to bring your children as well.
[38:14] Sure, they'll come here in a few days as well.
[38:19] I've come here to ask something of you.
[38:26] And I hope that you won't turn me down.
[38:34] In your home...
[38:36] there is peace...
[38:40] and there is happiness.
[38:47] Seeing...
[38:50] this, I feel...
[38:54] bringing it to my house...
[39:02] I don't understand...
Sister, nowadays, girls are very sharp and sly...
[39:11] But your daughter Hadia is very sincere and smart.
[39:17] You have raised your children well.
[39:24] I'm looking...
[39:28] for such a girl for my son.
[39:34] I hope you won't...
[39:38] let me go empty-handed.
[39:59] What happened? Aren't you taking the tea?
You should take it.
[40:04] Alright, is everything alright?
[40:07] Nothing happened... go... it's getting cold.
