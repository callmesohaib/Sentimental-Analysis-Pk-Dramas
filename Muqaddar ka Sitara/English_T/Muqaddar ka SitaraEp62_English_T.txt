[16:30] now I don't have any association with you
[16:36] neither of my friend or of my son
[16:46] all of this
[16:50] is predestined by God
[17:00] Sometimes they associate us, and sometimes they separate us
[17:12] the nature's plays are rare
[17:21] dear, I am sure that
[17:25] you must have
[17:29] forgiven me
[18:31] greetings to you! 
how are you all?
[18:36] ok children, you know that our school competition is about to start
[18:40] these are inter school competition. And children will perform & participate from all the cities
[18:47] you know children will be coming from all the schools & cities. And it will be a tough competition for us
[18:53] but I trust you girls. Are you going to make us proud?
[20:23] brother
[20:25] have you decided to go abroad in real?
[20:28] yes Farwa
[20:31] its been a lot of time, besides Faizan will come back tomorrow
[20:36] I have helped uncle as much as I could
[20:40] but now I have to leave
[20:42] I don't think so that uncle needs me anymore
[20:45] this way uncle will be left alone
[20:47] I don't want to stay here
[20:50] there are a lot of bitter memories of the past
[20:53] I also have a life, I want peace as well
[20:56] so do you still love Hadia?
[20:59] anyways leave it, tell me how are you?
[21:01] you cannot ignore me this way
[21:04] tell me honestly
[21:06] do you still love Hadia?
[21:08] love is never ending, Farwa
[21:10] it keeps on increasing
[21:13] sometimes by becoming peace or grief
[21:16] then why are you running away from love?
[21:18] not from love
[21:21] I am running away from my fate
[21:23] Hadia's name is not written in my fate, Farwa
[21:26] but there isn't any compulsion at all
[21:30] now there is no one in between you & Hadia
[21:35] distances can be lessened if you take a step forward
[21:40] listen to your heart for once
[21:43] No Farwa
[21:44] I've controlled my heart with a lot of difficulty
[21:50] I don't want to tolerate all the bearings once again
[21:53] but brother, what is the harm in trying once?
[21:58] please agree on it
[21:59] don't insist Farwa
[22:01] sometimes a person's efforts go in vain
[22:06] I don't want to give false hopes to my heart once again, please
[22:09] brother, maybe... 
[22:12] this time your heart doesn't break
[22:18] the way you are waiting for happiness
[22:20] the same way, somebody else must be waiting for you on the other side
[22:27] just once
[22:30] try to think about it for once
[23:09] ma'am Hadia, there is a guy to meet you. 
He says, he wants to meet ma'am Hadia
[23:13] who?
[23:14] he isn't telling me the name, he says he wants to meet Ma'am Hadia
[23:18] Okay, send him in
[23:26] Natasha, my dear child
[23:30] here you go, drink milk
[23:57] I know my presence is hurting you
[24:04] I am not capable enough to come in front of you
[24:08] and to apologize to you
[24:15] everything is finished
[24:20] I've become completely alone. Everything is ruined
[24:24] you've chosen this destruction for yourself
[24:27] you have not only made me face the loss, but you did injustice to yourself
[24:32] Hadia, I've realized all my mistakes & injustices very late
[24:39] I am getting so hurt today while listening my name from your mouth
[24:44] there was a time when your companionship was everything for me in my life
[24:51] you don't have an idea that what you did with me
[24:56] you have shaken my soul & existence
[25:01] my father died
[25:05] in the grief just because he had handover his daughter to a wrong person
[25:11] you didn't spared your own child as well
[25:20] you had refused to accept your child as your own, who does that?
[25:26] forgive me, Hadia
[25:30] I am your culprit, I did a lot of injustices. Please
[25:34] Please forgive me otherwise I won't be able to stay alive
[25:41] Please
[25:43] Please
[25:46] forgive me
[25:50] how unfortunate I am that I couldn't see my daughter, I couldn't love her
[25:56] I couldn't give her my name
[25:59] you have decided this punishment for yourself
[26:02] I just came to apologize to you, and... 
[26:08] I came to meet my daughter for the last time. After this I will leave for forever, I won't show you my face ever
[26:15] I forgave you, Faizan
[26:19] just because... 
[26:23] Natasha is your daughter
[26:28] and I don't want to keep my daughter away from her father
[26:34] I wish I had valued you
[26:37] then all of this wouldn't have happened
[26:44] take care of yourself and... 
[26:51] of our daughter too
[26:55] bye!
[26:57] Faizan
[28:22] take care
[28:51] today I am going far away from this country empty hands, after losing everything

[30:15] by leaving me alone over here
[30:18] you are not alone, a lot of people are here
[30:20] no fair Farwa! I didn't expect this from you
[30:24] I am joking! my mother has invited you & your mother as well
[30:29] in fact, aunty has got ready too
[30:32] do you know, my mother & you have made up a great team 
[30:36] now tell me what is your order for me?
[30:40] the order for you is that, quickly go & get ready
[30:44] because mom had asked me to reach there before time
[30:48] right now?
[30:49] yes
[30:53] ok fine, I'm going to get freshen up. Meanwhile take out my clothes
[30:57] I've already taken out your clothes

[36:13] my love, my emotions are true for you
[36:19] till the time I am alive, this heart
[36:22] Raazi's heart will keep on beating by taking your name
[36:28] even after a lot of time has passed
[36:31] but still your love hasn't lessen for me
[36:46] you also come along with us, uncle
[36:51] No dear.. 
[36:54] my support was till here only
