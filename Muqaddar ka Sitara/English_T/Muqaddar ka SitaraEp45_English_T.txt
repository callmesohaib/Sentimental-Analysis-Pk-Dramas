[01:04] Why are you sitting here alone?
Fizza is studying in my room, that's why I came here.
[01:12] Alright. Look, Safdar will scold me into the afterlife if something happens to your health.
[01:22] So please take care of yourself and that unborn child as well.
[01:29] I will try to do so.
I know that you neglect others whilst trying to make others happy.
[01:37] But leave that habit for now. Focus on yourself and your husband.
[01:44] Go out somewhere with Faizan and keep yourself dressed up.
[01:49] A husband needs his wife's attention.
[01:54] And yes... if Safdar has called Fizza here, then tell her that he has called her here to take care of you.
[02:02] Not to think that this is her home. She should take care of you.
[02:08] Understand? So tell her!
[02:54] What a time it was when my father used to tell me to marry Razi, and I used to refuse.
[03:03] And now, I've started liking him so much that even thinking of losing him, scares me.
[03:11] Thank God there is no one in Razi's life.
[03:37] Greetings mother, how are you?
Greetings to you too. Have you reached your hostel?
[03:43] No, I'm at sister's home.
[03:45] I went to university, I took my class, and came here.
Why? You should have gone to your hostel.
[03:51] That was the plan, but uncle Safdar called me here.
[03:57] Why? What happened? Is Hadia well?
[04:02] Yes, she is. If I tell you something, promise me that you won't tell sister and you won't ask her questions about it as well.
[04:12] Fizza enough... tell me what happened.
[04:17] Mother, sister is not happy at her home.
[04:22] There's a reason why I'm worried sick for her.
Brother Faizan doesn't give her time at all.
[04:30] He doesn't take care of her at all. I've been here for a while...
[04:35] and I haven't seen them talking. Natasha and aunt Shina don't talk to her as well.
[04:42] Sister doesn't take care of herself either. Brother Faizan comes home so late. He doesn't talk to her or take care of her.
[04:50] I don't understand what's happening.
Stay there, my dear.
[04:57] I'll bring your father to Karachi tomorrow. I'll bring her back here. She'll stay with us until she haves her baby.
[05:06] I will talk to brother Safdar as well. He made such big promises when he took her away.
[05:12] He said that there never will be tears in her eyes. But as soon as he took her there, he left her, like she had no family.
[05:23] Mother...
Khadija...
[05:28] What happened? Is everything alright?
I'll talk to you later.
[05:39] We're going to Karachi tomorrow.
[05:48] Khadija tell me what happened.
So much happened and Hadia didn't tell us.
[05:56] You know how Hadia is living there. There is no one to take care of her there.
[06:05] Sister Shina and brother Safdar aren't taking care of her. Even in her state.
[06:09] Will she have to fight for her husband's attention in her state?
[06:16] I told you that she won't be happy there.
[06:21] I don't care what happens. We'll go there tomorrow and bring our daughter here.
[06:31] So much happened and Hadia didn't tell us anything.
[06:40] There is a reason I was worried for her. I could feel that she was in trouble, but you didn't listen to me.
[06:50] All you see is your friends and their luxuries.
[06:55] You don't see your daughter's pain.
[07:02] What are you saying?
[07:05] I chose Faizan for my daughter so that he may give her all the happiness...
[07:13] that we couldn't give her.
What's the point of living in palaces, if the people inside are hardhearted?
[07:22] My daughter's heart is made of wax...
[07:27] Still, she tolerated all that pain, so that we may be at ease.
[07:40] We'll leave for Karachi in the morning.
[07:46] So much happened, I don't know how Hadia is tolerating all of this.
[07:55] I will bring my daughter back and I will ask them...
[08:01] I will ask them why they lied about Faizan to us.
[08:08] They betrayed us...
Enough Khadija. We'll talk to them tomorrow. I will ask Safdar...
[08:19] My dear child.
[08:36] I'm tired of this. You told me that you had no interest in Hadia and that you will leave her.
[08:43] But now she's pregnant, now it's harder for you to leave her.
[08:49] Very convenient.
[09:08] I will not tolerate any compromise with my child. I will not let any injustice happen to it.
[09:16] And now it's time for you to decide about your future. Otherwise, I won't let you see my and my child's face.
[10:24] Ramsha, what is it? Why are you calling me right now?
[10:27] Faizan, where are you? I've been waiting for you for ages.
[10:31] Ramsha, please...
Faizan, I'm pregnant as well...
[10:36] I need your care and your attention as well.
[10:40] The way you take care of Hadia and give her attention...
[10:44] I need all of that too and listen to me, I won't let you treat me unjustly anymore.
[10:51] Tell me, when are you coming to me?
[10:59] Hello... hello?
[11:08] Are you spying on me? I have a right to spy on you.
[11:14] Okay then. Do it, I don't care.
[11:17] Faizan, you are being unjust to me.
[11:21] And you? What are you doing?
Alleging me doesn't put a veil over your deeds.
[11:29] I know that you've been having this affair for a long time.
[11:35] So what? What will you do about it?
[11:41] One thing is for sure, I will not stay silent. No matter who she is, you'll have to leave her now.
[11:47] Otherwise, I will tell my father and yours. They too should know...
[11:52] Who is this girl who calls you in the middle of the night? What relationship do you have with her?
[12:02] Tell me...
[12:14] Faizan...
[12:43] Hello...
I apologize for disturbing you...
[12:46] Who's this?
[12:48] Fawad...
[12:52] You?
[12:53] No matter how many times you block my number, I'll call you with a new number every time.
[12:58] You are lucky, I was about to complain about you to the principal.
[13:02] But you didn't do that. I'm sure your heart must have stopped you.
[13:07] If you had complained and if I had endured a loss, then you would have had to pay a heavy price for that.
[13:14] What nonsense is this? What would you have done?
You would have known that if I had done that.
[13:21] Right now I'm at your relative's house. Where you're living right now.
[13:27] You left your assignment at the cafeteria today, come and take it.
Right now?
[13:35] Have you seen the time? This is not the time to visit someone's home. Take it with you, I'll take it from you tomorrow, at the university.
[13:42] Should I come inside?
Are you insane? I'll take it tomorrow from you.
[13:48] I can't guarantee tomorrow...
[13:50] Who knows that I might lose it tonight.
Don't throw it away, I worked hard on it.
[13:58] Who's throwing it away? This is very close to my heart.
[14:03] Give it to the guard outside and begone.
That won't happen!
[14:09] I came here from very far away. Come outside and take this away from me.
[14:47] Give me the assignment and begone.
[14:51] I'm warning you one last time. Either give it to me or begone from here, I'll make a new one.
[14:56] Will you work so hard again?
[15:09] Safdar, come here.
[15:12] What happened?
[15:14] Come here, I want to show you something.
[15:26] What is it?
[15:34] Who are these two?
[15:37] I don't know about the guy, but the girl...
[15:41] is Fizza...
What are you saying?
[15:46] How can that be?
[15:50] Stand here and look for a while and you'll know it.
[15:56] Wait a minute, what's the hurry? Look at this.
[16:10] How did you like that? You mentioned going to the dean and complaining about me.
[16:17] If you go there, in return I have this present for you.
[16:20] How do you like that?
I could never imagine that you could be so vile.
[16:24] I will complain about you. You will learn when your career is ruined.
[16:30] Alright sure, complain about me. But remember, if you do complain about me...
[16:37] then these pictures will go to your fiance. After that, if your life gets ruined...
[16:43] then let it be.
What do you want from me?
[16:46] I only want to become your friend.
I don't want to see your face and you're asking me to become your friend.
[16:54] Alright fine. When your family learns about this, all of them will spit at you for this.
[17:00] Because these pictures and videos are going viral on social media.
[17:06] Do whatever you want, I won't be scared by your threats. Begone!
[17:31] Do you believe it now seeing it with your own eyes?
[17:35] Go and ask her, who that man was and why she was meeting him like this.
[17:41] Shina, I'll find the right time to talk to her about it.
[17:47] You will not say anything to Hadia or Fizza about this. Please...
[18:30] Alright, Alright sure, complain about me. But remember...
[18:37] if you do complain about me, then these pictures will go to your fiance. After that, if your life gets ruined...
[18:43] After that, if your life gets ruined, then let it be.
[18:59] I don't want to see your face and you're asking me to become your friend.
Alright fine...
[19:04] When your family learns about this, all of them will spit at you for this. Because these pictures and videos will be viral on social media.
[19:45] Why do you think I'm obligated to answer you? Do whatever you want. I'm not scared anymore.
[19:53] I will have affairs, I will meet her every day and I'll marry her as well.
[19:59] I will not let you do that.
Who are you to stop me?
[20:04] You have lost rights over me.
You are wrong. You know that you are being unjust to me!
[20:10] To hide your sins you're being unjust to me. But I won't tolerate it anymore, I'll tell father everything.
[20:15] Stop threatening me with father.
[20:22] I told you, I don't get scared of your threats anymore.
[20:28] I'll do as I feel like. I will have affairs and marriages.
[20:39] Do whatever you want.
Faizan! Faizan!
[21:07] Sister...
[21:10] Fizza...
[21:12] Faizan...
I know everything, I've seen it.
[21:17] What's my fault in this? He's being disloyal to me and alleging me for it.
[21:23] Control yourself. We won't stay here anymore, we'll go home. I didn't like brother Faizan treat you like this.
[21:33] No, mother and father shouldn't find out about this.
Why? Why do you want to hide this from everyone?
[21:38] Thank God that I saw this myself.
[21:42] You never tell us anything.
[21:46] This has gone long enough. I will everyone about this.
This will only make matters worst and I don't want to destroy my home.
[21:56] Control yourself, sister.
You will not say a word to anyone.
[22:03] No... I won't hide anything from anyone. It's not good to hide things from parents.
[22:08] You tolerated as much as you, no more.
No, you won't say a word to your mother and father.
[22:16] You will not say anything.
Control yourself and stop crying.
[22:21] I'm fine.
[22:25] Mother and father shouldn't know about this.
[22:45] Mother, did you call me?
Yes, my dear.
[22:51] Tell me, do you need to go to work tomorrow?
[22:57] Mother, I have a meeting, other than that, if you have something I'll try to manage it.
[23:04] I came to tell you at night, but you were sleeping.
[23:09] Actually, some people are coming to see Farwa tomorrow.
[23:15] Really... that's good. Who are they?
[23:20] They are strangers. The matchmaker I asked to find a proposal for you was telling me...
[23:28] that she has an acquaintance with a family, whose son is educated, and with a good job.
[23:34] I decided to invite them tomorrow. This way we'll meet them and see what kind of family they are.
[23:41] What do you say?
[23:44] That's very good. What about Farwa's education?
[23:48] They have no objections.
Alright. Can you invite them this evening?
[23:56] I will invite them tomorrow if I show haste it won't leave a good impression.
[24:02] And besides... I need to talk about this with Safdar as well.
[24:07] And... then I will invite them tomorrow.
Alright, mother.
[24:11] As you wish. I was going for a walk...
[24:15] Should I bring something back for you?
Not for me, but I was thinking of buying new clothes for Farwa.
[24:22] That's a good idea. It would be better if Farwa chooses her dress.
[24:29] That's true. Let her buy for herself.
[24:35] Tell me... the pictures I showed you, did you like a girl from among them?
[24:42] Mother, let Farwa get married first, then we'll take a look at it.
[24:48] Did you ask Farwa if she was willing to marry or not?
[24:54] My dear, she has left everything to us.
[24:58] Still mother, you should know Farwa's opinion.
[25:04] Only Farwa has the right to choose the man. I won't say yes if Farwa doesn't like the guy.
[25:11] Of course, I want that too. I want Farwa to make her life decisions.
[25:17] Show me the pictures, and let me see how the man looks.
[25:27] Here you go.
[25:57] Good morning*
[26:02] How do you feel now?
[26:06] I feel better, but I still have a headache. You fought with Hadia last night, right?
[26:15] No... the way you were talking in your sleep, it seemed that way.
[26:21] I was tired, and one can say anything when they are sleepy.
[26:26] But Faizan, you refused to come here...
[26:33] Yes, but I realized that you might need me here that's why I came here.
[27:01] It's a call from the office.
[27:07] Hello...
[27:10] Cancel it, I'll take a look at it later.
[27:19] Faizan, since when you've started ignoring Hadia?
What's the matter Ramsha?
[27:27] Is there no other topic you can talk about other than Hadia?
Alright relax, I won't talk about Hadia.
[27:37] We'll talk about something else. Did your position at work get stronger?
[27:46] I'm trying. It will happen.
[27:57] Shall I make breakfast for you?
[28:01] No, not now, in a little while.
[28:14] Uncle Safdar, you called me?
[28:17] Sit down.
[28:22] Yes?
[28:25] My dear, who was that guy who came to meet you last night?
[28:30] He is my class fellow...
[28:36] Why was he here?
[28:42] My assignment was left with him, he came to return it.
[28:47] In the middle of the night?
[28:53] Look, my dear...
[28:57] I trust you.
[29:01] You are my brother Aleem's daughter and hence you are my daughter as well.
[29:10] I'm not suspecting you, but the society we live in...
[29:17] we need to be careful of the way it works.
[29:24] No matter if he's your college friend...
[29:28] I have no objection if you exchange notes with each other...
[29:35] but in the middle of the night, you can call him home. I have no objections, I allow you to...
[29:44] But my dear it would be better...
[29:48] from now on he doesn't come home, especially not at night.
[29:53] Yes, I won't give you a chance to complain again.
[30:02] Bless you. You can go.
[30:16] Sister...
What happened Fizza?
[30:19] Sister...
[30:23] Tell me what happened. I've been wanting to talk to you since last night but...
[30:29] but...
Stop crying and tell me what happened.
[30:36] Fawad came here last night...
[30:40] He came here and uncle Safdar saw him as well. He threatened me as well. I don't know what will happen now.
[30:47] What?
[30:48] Yes... he told me that he'll do something that will defame me in front of everybody
[30:57] He also told me that he will tell Nisar everything as well. What will I do now?
How dare he!
[31:05] How could he stoop so low?
[31:09] You should have complained about him for a long time. You are late.
I was thinking of his career. I didn't want to ruin it.
[31:17] To hell with him. He doesn't deserve to be thought of in a good way.
[31:22] Anyways... we can't change what happened. We need to think carefully about this now.
[31:29] But what will I do now? Look, he's calling me... I won't pick up his call.
[31:38] Pick up and talk to him...
No sister...
[31:41] Pick up and listen to what he has to say.
[31:48] Hello... why are you calling me now?
[31:53] It's nothing bad, it's a surprise. You will get a surprise from me today.
[31:59] This was my last call to you, because from now on...
[32:06] you will call me...
Hello... what are you saying...
[32:12] What is he saying?
[32:17] Miss Hadia your parents are here.
[32:20] Mother and father...
[32:25] Don't tell them anything, they will be so worried.
You will not say a word.
[32:33] I will take care of this. We'll do something about this.
Alright, go ahead. I'll wash my face.
[32:38] Wipe your tears and come downstairs. I'll deal with my mother and father.
[33:12] It's been a while since we met you.
[33:15] Yes, we do visit you guys often, but it seems you guys have forgotten the way to our home.
[33:22] Hadia is dropped off by the driver as well.
[33:27] Faizan has joined work nowadays, so he stays busy with that.
[33:33] Faizan is something special.
[33:36] He didn't visit us even when he didn't go to work.
[33:42] Razi my dear, what's going on nowadays?
[33:50] Nothing special, I mostly stay in the office and I do not find much time off.
[33:56] That's great. Sister Sajda...
[34:00] when are you marrying Razi then?
[34:04] Brother, I explain that to him a lot but he doesn't listen to me. Please try to make him understand...
[34:12] Why don't you agree Razi? This house should have a second daughter-in-law.
[34:19] Greetings.
[34:22] Greetings to you too.
[34:25] Greetings to you too. How are you Hadia?
[34:29] What is the matter Hadia? Are you feeling well?
[34:35] You look diminished, is everything alright?
[34:39] No... I am taking care of myself. Continue sitting, I'll go check what's happening in the kitchen.
[34:49] Hadia is perfectly well, we've been taking good care of her. Maybe you feel that way because you're seeing her after a long time.
[34:59] I think you should focus on your daughter Fizza...
[35:04] She seems lost and diminished nowadays, right Fizza?
[35:15] What is the matter, my dear?
[35:19] Nothing, everything is alright.
[35:22] Sister, children tend to get this way when they are burdened with education.
[35:29] Yes, brother... I wanted to take your permission on something brother...
[35:36] I wanted to take away Hadia with me.
Why not? You can take her away whenever you want.
[35:47] Rather... if you allow it I would like Hadia to stay with us until the delivery.
[35:56] Till the delivery? There's a lot of time in that, how is that possible?
[36:06] Yes... I don't see anything wrong with it...
[36:11] Besides, I think maybe Faizan gets disturbed when she's here.
[36:19] What do you mean?
Nothing. I just want my daughter to be happy.
[36:26] That has a good effect on the baby.
[36:31] Sister, you can take Hadia with you for as long as you want. But our house won't be the same without her.
[36:42] I won't let you guys leave without having dinner. This way the driver will drop you guys off in the evening as well.
[36:46] No brother, there's no need for that. We'll just leave.
[36:52] Right, dear?
We can't allow you to leave without having dinner.
[37:01] Nisar is here nowadays... let's invite brother Rehman and his family.
[37:10] All of us will sit together and have lunch. What do you think Fizza?
[37:15] Brother Aleem, I think you should marry them both.
[37:21] The circumstances nowadays are very bad. This way they'll be saved from a lot of bad.
[37:30] Sister... I'm not only looking to marry them both...
[37:35] rather I want to send her away immediately after she gets married.
[37:40] After her education is over.
That is four years from now.
[37:48] Lord knows what might happen in between all these years.
[37:58] Shina please, she is his daughter and he knows better.
[38:15] Brother Rehman calling.
Excuse me.
[38:21] Greetings.
[38:23] You have embarrassed us, brother Aleem. Why did you engage your daughter with our son, when she was involved with someone else?
[38:33] What are you saying brother Rehman, I don't understand that at all.
[38:42] We have received some pictures of your daughter with one of her class fellows.
[38:47] She set a hundred conditions with Nisar, but she was so casual with that boy in those photographs.
[38:58] We were impressed by you people, but it seems like we were wrong.
Brother Nisar.
[39:06] You have it wrong.
No, we don't. Everything is clear.
[39:11] You have deceived us. But we are honorable people
[39:16] We don't understand your hypocrisy. We have been embarrassed in our extended family.
[39:21] Think that this relationship is over...
Brother Rehman...
[39:49] Father, what happened?
[39:56] Brother Aleem, tell me what happened.
[40:03] Uncle, is everything okay?
[40:13] Everything is over.
What?
