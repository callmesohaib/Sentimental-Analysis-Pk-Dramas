[01:28] I wanted to assure you that I never flirted with you.
[01:34] I never expressed false emotions to you.
[01:40] Everything I said wasn't a lie.
[01:48] We can't change what happened.
[01:50] Now I think that a misunderstanding has developed between us.
[01:58] Maybe you thought that I was uncle Safdar's son, right?
[02:07] It never occurred to me that uncle Safdar would ask your hand in marriage for Faizan.
[02:17] Anyways, when I heard this...
[02:21] I was very hurt and I was shocked as well.
[02:29] I was sure that...
[02:31] a sensitive and sensible girl could never choose a man like Faizan.
[02:40] That's why I was suspicious...
[02:43] I'm sure that there was some misunderstanding between us. 
[02:46] I thought you got greedy seeing all the wealth...
[02:58] I was upset at you...
[03:02] I won't lie to you.
[03:05] That's why...
[03:10] Anyways...
[03:12] We can't change what happened.
[03:17] Today I respect you even more.
[03:29] I feel envious of Faizan's luck.
[03:36] Love at first sight...
[03:40] I didn't believe it before...
[03:46] Ever since I met you...
[03:52] I started to believe it.
[03:56] Anyways...
[04:01] We can't change what happened.
[04:04] It seems that our relationship was only to a certain degree.
[04:10] Maybe it's our fate to live in one house.
[04:15] But Hadia...
[04:18] I wanted to request something...
[04:23] From now on, please trust me...
[04:30] I will never become a cause for worry for you.
[04:33] I promise that if you ever need me with any difficulty...
[04:40] you can please call me, without hesitating.
[04:45] I'll be there to help you.
[04:54] You...
[04:56] You are a good man.
[05:00] There is no doubt about that.
[05:06] But now...
[05:09] I don't need your sympathies and your help.
[05:18] Remove...
[05:22] all feeling that you have for me...
[05:28] I...
[05:30] I have removed them as well.
[05:35] Hadia...
[06:33] Mother... father, I think sister is here.
Khadija hurry up.
[06:40] Sure, I'm coming.
Our son-in-law is here, let's go and welcome him.
[06:59] Greetings*
[07:03] Greeting* How are you, my dear?
I'm well, how are you?
[07:08] Greetings*
How are you, son? It's been a while since I met you.
[07:14] Faizan had to go to an important meeting. There was no driver at home...
[07:20] So, uncle asked me to drop her off.
That's alright. You're family as well.
[07:27] This way I got to meet you.
Thank you so much. I should leave now.
[07:32] Where are you going? Lunch is ready and I won't let you leave without eating.
[07:38] Uncle... I have something important to take care of, 
[07:41] I didn't want to come here, but my uncle asked me to come here to drop Hadia off.
[07:47] Don't call her Hadia, call her your sister-in-law. She's your sister-in-law now.
[07:52] It doesn't seem nice. Don't be so formal, wash up, until then I'll serve lunch.
[07:57] Come, my dear. Come on.
[08:01] Come, son.
[08:05] Did you face any trouble on the way here?
[08:10] You came here such a long way, with that man, alone. Are you insane?
[08:16] Mother, Faizan was busy...
[08:18] So you shouldn't have come. You didn't need to come here.
[08:21] Uncle Safdar sent me here with him. There was no driver available as well.
[08:26] He might have said that, but you should have used your head. He was just getting rid of the problem.
[08:32] You should have had some sense.
[08:35] What if something had happened? I would have asked your father to pick you up.
[08:41] Mother, enough.
[08:44] What's the matter with you? Don't you trust my sister?
It's not about trust.
[08:50] There is a lot of difference in life, before and after marriage. A girl must be very cautious of her in-laws.
[08:56] I trust you, but not in the world.
[09:01] Alright, don't worry, please.
I'm not worried.
[09:07] I'm afraid.
[09:11] What if someone tells people about you and Razi?
Who would do that?
[09:16] Razi himself can tell.
No, he won't. He is not like that.
[09:22] He isn't like how we thought him to be.
[09:25] Rather, all of my misunderstandings have drifted away.
Stop praising him.
[09:31] No man is worthy of trust, especially a man who has endured a loss.
[09:35] Mother, I'm not the only one praising him. Uncle Safdar praises him as well. 
[09:39] He has also handed his entire business to Razi.
[09:42] He thinks he's more capable than Faizan. He trusts him a lot.
I'm your mother...
[09:48] I raised you. My hair didn't gray in the sun. I know the ups and downs of life
[09:54] Don't take what I say lightly.
[09:58] Alright, don't worry. I'll be careful from now on.
[10:19] You didn't do right by sending Hadia with Razi.
[10:23] What's so wrong with it?
[10:25] He's Faizan's brother.
[10:27] He's Faizan's brother, but he isn't Hadia's brother.
[10:31] For God's sake Shina...
[10:34] What kind of thing is that to say?
[10:36] Safdar, you don't know how these men from little cities are...
[10:40] They live their entire lives in suffocation. They lose all control at the very sight of any independence.
[10:48] It was not so important for her to meet her parents.
[10:50]  If we fulfill her every whim and fancy, she'll run circles around us!
[10:57] Hadia, will not forget her place.
[11:01] Do one thing.
[11:04] Take Hadia with you. Groom her and take her out shopping.
[11:09] I want my daughter-in-law...
[11:13] to stand out.
[11:16] Of course, don't worry.
[11:20] I'll need some money of course.
[11:39] Son, I like these people.
[11:44] They are good.
[11:46] What do you think?
[11:48] Uncle, my feelings are the same.
[11:51] Apart from that, they also happily accepted the time we asked of them.
[11:58] Tell me, did anything seem strange to you about them?
[12:04] No, uncle, they seemed good people to me. I didn't feel anything like that from him.
[12:12] If it were anything like that, I would have shared it with you.
[12:15] Look, uncle...
[12:18] Fizza is like my sister.
[12:20] Don't worry, take this decision in God's name.
[12:25] Thank you, son. It makes me happy to hear that from you. I feel more at peace now.
[12:33] Thank you so much.
The only thing is that...
[12:37] If Faizan could have come...
[12:42] I can understand sir, don't worry... from next time he'll be present whenever you need him to be.
[12:53] He had to go somewhere urgently...
Yes son, I know.
[13:01] I'm running late uncle...
[13:04] could please call her...
Yes, it is getting late.
[13:11] Hadia... my dear. Hurry up my dear, it's getting late.
[13:20] These girls, never stop talking.
[13:27] Farewell.
[13:29] Farewell.
[13:35] Okay uncle, farewell.
[13:58] You look more interested in your phone than in me.
[14:01] Will you do that in the future as well?
[14:05] What do you mean in the future?
[14:07] I'm talking about after our marriage. You'll marry me, right?
[14:11] Are you in your senses?
What did I say... in fact...
[14:17] I love you.
[14:19] I wanted to say that to you multiple times but...
[14:23] you never seem to appreciate me.
[14:29] Are you making fun of me?
[14:31] No, but... I don't think of you in that way...
[14:36] That's not a big deal...
[14:40] You might think that I'm a middle-class guy...
[14:44] You think I'm lacking somewhere and there is something that is lacking in me...
[14:48] I'm alone, I don't have a family, maybe that's why you think I'm not reliable.
[14:54] Because of that, I'm hesitating to talk to your father.
[14:59] It's good that you hesitated because you should have talked to me first.
[15:06] I'm talking to you right now.
[15:09] Look, we're just friends and I don't want to think about anything more than that about you.
[15:13] Look, Natasha, you are being hasty.
[15:18] Think about it calmly, then make a decision.
[15:23] Sherry please, I don't want to talk about this topic.
[15:29] Natasha...
[15:33] If you don't mind, could you drop me at home? My car broke down today.
[15:40] Let's go.
[16:00] I was sure...
[16:02] that a sensitive and sensible girl could never choose a man like Faizan
[16:11] I suspected...
[16:14] that there was some misunderstanding between us.
[16:18] I felt as though you said yes in greed for wealth, as most girls do.
[16:50] If you have prayed, we're going out.
[16:53] Where?
Shopping
[16:55] Shopping?
[16:57] Father said that I should take you out shopping for your sister's engagement.
[17:02] But, isn't it late?
[17:06] This is Karachi, the city doesn't sleep at night.
[17:11]  I'm changing, you should do. We'll leave in a little while.
[17:47] This is the one...
You live here...
[17:57] But didn't I drop you off at a flat?
[18:00] No... that's my friend Basit's flat. When I'm bored I go there.
[18:06] This is my real house.
[18:09] You live alone in this big house.
Yes, because I have no one.
[18:16] What is the matter?
Why are you so shocked seeing that house?
[18:22] Maybe you thought I was just an ordinary guy, right?
[18:26] It's not your fault. I don't have any such official activity
[18:31] You thought that I useless guy.
[18:36] But Natasha if I were really like that...
[18:39] then I would never have dared to propose to you.
[18:44] You're surprised because I don't have any official business.
[18:53] My father has two major plazas in this city.
[18:59] And he left a small business behind for me. 
[19:02] I have a big rest house in Murree, for which I receive a few shares
[19:06] We have two cars, I think this wealth is enough for me.
[19:12] It will be enough for my wife as well.
[19:18] Won't you come inside?
[19:22] No, I have to go.
[19:25] Okay...
See you bye.
[19:45] We'll visit a stylist tomorrow.
[19:48] Why?
To get a great haircut.
[19:52] I don't need a haircut.
You do.
[19:56] I don't like this hair on you.
[19:59] But, I like it this way.
[20:03] I just told you that I don't like your hair. 
[20:06] Being my wife you should be stylish. Change your wardrobe and your hairstyle.
[20:12] And... as my wife, you should listen to me and be aware of what I like, and what I don't.
[20:19] Yes but, I won't feel comfortable.
[20:23] And... I will never cut my hair.
[20:28] I heard that Pakistani wives listen to everything that their husbands tell them, but you...
[20:32] just say no every time.
[22:03] Yes, mom?
[22:05] Faizan where have you been for so long with Hadia?
[22:09] You say the strangest things. 
[22:11] You never asked me that when I was with my girlfriends. But now that I'm with my wife...
[22:16] Father gave me money to shop, so I'm here to do that.
[22:19] Buy her something cheap.
[22:21] For her, that will be enough.
[22:24] I want her to look stylish with me, so I'll buy her good clothes.
[22:31] Whatever it may be, hurry on back.
Okay...
[22:52] Shall we go somewhere else, they don't have my type of dresses.
[22:55] But they do have a dress according to my type.
[22:58] How does this look?
[23:06] Doesn't it look nice? Let's go and look inside. Come in.
[24:18] You look beautiful.
[24:21] Why didn't you buy the dress I bought you?
[24:25] I told you that I don't wear such clothes, please...
[24:29] don't ever ask me to wear such clothes again.
[24:34] Okay.
[24:36] I won't.
[26:12] Natasha, why aren't you ready yet?
[26:16] Because I don't want to go.
[26:20] What if your father asks?
[26:23] What if I ask him why he did all of this to me, then what?
[26:28] Natasha, you are giving me a headache arguing over this!
[26:35] Yeah, right! You think this is nonsense as well...
[26:39] A man who was about to marry me is getting married to them and father is hosting their engagement in my home.
[26:47] Very good, I have no value in this house.
[26:50] You know very well why your father...
[26:52] arranged the engagement party here, he doesn't want to hurt you.
[26:57] I'm sure that's right... whatever! Please go.
[27:01] Go and have fun at the engagement party.
Natasha look at me!
[27:06] You're getting ready in five minutes and coming downstairs. I don't want to hear any arguments.
[27:12] I'm not going anywhere, and you can leave
[29:20] Are you happy now? Go and offer your family something sweet.
[29:52] Tomorrow morning is Nisar's flight. 
[29:56] You have made it much easier for us by accepting our wishes.
[30:01] I am thankful to both of you.
What's the matter with you?
[30:06] It's not a big deal.
It is Safdar.
[30:10] It was our wish that when Nisar leaves, he should be married or engaged.
[30:16] There wasn't much time if you and brother Aleem hadn't cooperated then...
[30:25] Whatever happened was because of Safdar.
[30:31] If they hadn't taken the initiative, this would have happened. To tell you the truth...
[30:38] when I heard you, I was a little worried.
[30:43] You two are embarrassing me...
[30:49] As far as our daughters are concerned, they are all the same to me. 
[30:54] I didn't do any favors to anyone.
[31:00] Brother, do you remember your promise...
[31:09] We can't send Fizza away before three years. Fizza needs to complete her education.
[31:16] Don't worry about it. Their studies take priority. 
[31:21] Don't worry, Nisar needs time to complete his specialization as well.
[31:41] By God's good grace, they were such good people. 
[31:43] If only Hadia had gotten a great family like them.
[31:46] Khadija, surely they are great people. But don't complain all the time.
[31:54] I'm not complaining but you know...
[31:59] Sister Shina's behavior is growing worse. 
[32:03] I admit that she doesn't like us visiting them...
[32:06] but at least they should treat Hadia well. She's a diamond.
May God...
[32:14] give all happiness in the world to our daughter.
[32:19] Safdar is a good man, that's why I married my daughter into his home.
[32:23] I know that he will always keep her happy and he will not allow anything bad to happen to her.
[32:31] He's the one who found this suitor for Fizza.
[32:36] You were just praising him a while ago.
[33:00] Yes...
[33:01] Of course, anytime... you're most welcome.
[33:08] Really... why don't you come in the evening today. It's your home.
[33:14] Alright, I'll be waiting. Farewell.
[33:25] Is it a diamond?
[33:26] It can only be a diamond. His fiance is a rich man, doing his doctorate in the US
[33:32] They are diamond people.
[33:34] You are very lucky to get married into such a rich family.
[33:37] Enough... why are you constantly mentioning their wealth.
[33:41] My parents didn't fix this marriage because they are rich...
[33:47] they fixed this marriage because they are educated and cultural people. 
[33:50] If I wanted to marry into a rich family, why would they have chosen me?
[33:57] Have you met your fiance?
[34:00] I think you should meet him.
[34:05] How can I? He left for the US, last night.
[34:12] Talk to him on the phone. Talk to him on a video call and have him talk to us as well.
[34:17] Alright, it's time for my class, I'll get going.
[34:21] Sure...
[34:24] I'll meet you in the evening. Come on.
[34:33] Fizza has engaged someone.
[34:37] She's out of your hands.
[34:39] How come you're so relaxed, I just said...
Easy...
[34:43] It's only an engagement. People break off weddings and this is only an engagement.
[34:50] You don't know me. See what I'll do now.
[35:02] Fizza wait...
I'll be right there.
[35:08] You're engaged?
[35:10] Yes... you knew I liked you...
[35:14] Still...
[35:16] Firstly, I didn't know that you liked me.
[35:21] Secondly, if you even liked me, it makes no difference to me...
[35:25] And lastly, I chose to get myself engaged. 
[35:29] So there is no point in discussing the first two things.
[35:32] From now on, don't stop me like that. Understand?
[35:47] Don't worry, Mrs. Safdar, I will find a suitor according to your demands for your daughter.
[35:53] I have a few proposals from abroad.
[35:56]  I'll check their recent status and update you.
[36:00] Call Natasha, and let me meet her.
[36:03] Sure. Najma, ask Natasha to come to the drawing room.
[36:13] Hello Natasha... how are you?
What kind of proposals do you have for me?
[36:18] I mean what background do they have and what are their demands?
[36:23] Natasha, I've discussed that with her. You need not involve yourself in such matters.
[36:28] If they want a bookworm don't bring their proposal here.
[36:34] It doesn't matter to me what kind of girl they want, just find me a guy according to my needs.
[36:40] The guy should be abroad and rich...
[36:46] He should have a living lifestyle like us. 
[36:49] I don't care about what religion he is.
Natasha...
[36:54] When I'm speaking, you need not get in between this. Ask Najma to make tea for her.
[37:03] You're looking for a suitor for me and I shouldn't give my opinion.
[37:07] Maybe you're forgetting, in our religion, we are allowed to marry whomever we want.
[37:13] Please, auntie, don't bring a proposal from a typical and conservative family.
[37:18] The guy should be like me. 
[37:20] Someone who is stylish, modern, and broad-minded. Alright?
[37:25] And I can't stay in a joint family as well.
[37:29] So, take care of that as well.
[37:32] I cannot handle relationships with mothers and sisters-in-law...
[37:37] What's the point of living if one has to live in suffocation after one's marriage?
[37:43] My dear, your father wants you to get married to honest, honorable, and educated people.
[37:48] Even if they aren't equal to your status.
[37:52] But still, I'll try that whatever proposals I bring you aren't from a joint family.
[37:57] Honorable people prefer living in a joint family.
[38:01] Don't try, you will find the proposal I deserve.
[38:06] The guy's standard should be exactly like ours.
[38:12] If you can find a guy like that, introduce me to him.
[38:16] Otherwise don't come here again. Thanks.
[38:26] Don't mind... she's a child. She says whatever she feels.
[38:34] Please eat...
