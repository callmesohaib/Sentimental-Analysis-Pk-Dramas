[01:19] Who are you, people?
Give us all the cash and jewelry you have!
[01:22] We have nothing at home. Go away!
We'll take it ourselves.
[01:29] Sit down here.... give me the bag.
Is there anyone? Save me!
[01:35] Leave my bag alone, they only have clothes.
Shut up! Open up the bag!
[01:44] I have nothing in my bag...
Look at the jewelry...
[01:49] Save me... help!
[01:54] Help! Help! Help!
Silence!
[02:00] Let's go.
[02:43] Arbab this is great. I didn't expect this much loot. It would be easy for us to get by if we manage to find a loot like this once every four months.
[02:55] Your three months quota is completed.
Please have this sold. I'll pay the house rent with it.
[03:03] Sure, don't worry.
[03:07] Tell me, why didn't she call you? She should have informed you. She just got robbed.
[03:17] You're right. I was thinking that I should go.
[03:22] Did you guys hurt her?
No, we didn't even touch her.
[03:28] Don't worry. That will never happen.
[03:31] Let's go. Wind this up...
Alright.
[03:46] Natasha?
[03:49] What happened, why are you sitting here?
[03:54] What happened? Why are you crying? Tell me, what happened.
[03:58] We have been robbed, Sherry. They took all of my stuff.
[04:06] How did they get inside? Why did you open the door?
[04:13] You should have at least called me.
[04:17] How could I have called you, they took my phone as well. I don't know where you are.
[04:25] What would you have done even if you were here? They had a gun.
[04:32] Natasha, you don't like me being at home. When I'm home, you stay busy on your phone and don't even talk to me.
[04:42] Look, that's why I ask you to close the door when I leave...
[04:47] because I know this place isn't safe, nor are there any guards nearby. Anything can happen at any time.
[04:56] Alright, please relax. Forget what happened. Think that you gave it all to charity.
[05:01] Such a huge amount for charity?
What did they take?
[05:05] All of my jewelry, my phone, they took away everything.
[05:19] Please stop crying. Everything will be alright.
[06:12] You're late again today.
Why were you waiting Hadia?
[06:18] You should have slept.
[06:23] I told you that I would get late for the hospital.
[06:28] You shouldn't have waited.
How can I sleep when you're so worried?
[06:38] What happened Faizan?
[06:42] How is he now?
[06:47] It's the same. He's not alright.
[06:57] I'll stay with him at the hospital tomorrow.
[07:08] Why? Doesn't he have a family?
What's the big deal if I stay?
[07:13] That's why I don't share anything with you. You always say something different.
[07:40] I'm sorry.
[07:47] Don't get upset, I'm apologizing.
I never know when you might get upset
[07:53] You get angry over everything. You were so pleasant with me just a few days ago and now it's reverted. Why don't you tell me what you want?
[08:13] Try to understand my behavior.
[08:20] Honestly, I'm very disturbed right now. I'm very upset.
[08:27] I need some space.
[08:31] My friend is very critical.
[08:35] I need to go.
[08:39] I have to go.
[10:06] Hello...
Rizwan, you have put me into trouble.
[10:10] Why, what happened?
Your guy took her phone as well.
[10:13] I'll have to buy her a new one now, what is the point of the robbery now?
I have it here, come take it.
[10:20] Really, what will I tell her when she asks me where I got it from?
[10:27] Tell her that you found it at home, behind a sofa, or in a cupboard.
[10:32] She's Natasha, she remembers everything. She told me that her phone was on the table.
[10:40] Alright then, what can be done now?
She won't just be happy with any old phone.
[10:44] Sure then, sell this and buy a similar one for her. What difference does it make?
[10:50] I'll do something about it. Bye.
Alright.
[11:13] Are you visiting your friend?
[11:16] Yes...
Should I come alone?
[11:21] Why?
[11:23] That way I'll be able to spend time with you. Besides, I get bored sitting at home.
[11:30] No, you can't go there. He's in the ICU. I'm going there because his family needs financial help.
[11:41] I might stay the night. I promise that I would help him in tough times. I might stay the night as well.
[11:52] That is very thoughtful, but you'll have to promise me one thing as well.
[11:57] What?
That you'll take me out to have ice cream tomorrow.
[12:04] I don't like ice cream.
I don't like it as well, but I need a reason to go out with you.
[12:12] Alright, we'll go if something important doesn't come up.
[12:18] Tell me, which hospital are you going to?
Why are you asking?
[12:23] I'll send lunch for you through the driver.
I'm not going to a party.
[12:34] I'm going to the hospital. I'll find food there.
[12:38] Alright, be sure to eat it on time.
[12:47] Now go.
[12:51] Faizan...
[12:56] Don't go. I feel very worried.
[13:18] If I hadn't promised...
[13:21] then I wouldn't have gone.
[13:57] Ramsha, are you ready?
[14:02] By God's good grace, you look so lovely.
You don't look any less than me.
[14:12] Did you tell the cleric about the dower?
Yes, I did, and I told him not to mention them to the groom.
[14:22] I told him that the groom agreed to it.
But Faizan will be surprised by the amount of the dower.
[14:28] Let him, what can he do then? Nothing.
[14:34] I have to hand it to you. Though it was hard, you still managed to control him.
[14:41] I told you that it isn't easy to leave me. But the conditions he made, I don't understand them at all...
[14:50] I didn't like them as well.
If you hadn't decided to go to his father that day...
[14:55] then maybe he wouldn't have written those conditions. He hasn't arrived yet, call and ask him where he is.
[15:03] He must be on his way, I'll call and ask him.
Sure, I'll check in on the guests.
[15:09] God bless you!
[15:32] Drink this.
[15:35] Why, what is in this?
It's blessed water, it will drive all your tensions away.
[15:51] Faizan...
[15:56] Don't go, I feel very worried.
[16:33] Hello.
[16:34] Faizan, where are you? All the guests are here. The cleric is asking for you as well.
[16:44] I'm on the way. Faizan, you're coming, right? You're not betraying me, right?
[16:54] You know what, if you don't trust me, then why have you decided to spend the rest of your life with me?
[17:03] If you don't trust me, then don't marry me.
It's not like that, I trust you more than I trust myself.
[17:16] I was asking you because of my mother. I don't think she still trusts you.
[17:22] Your mother can't change. I committed to come and so I will.
[17:28] I know that very well. Hurry up, so that all my mother's doubts clear away.
[17:36] And so that we are together, forever.
[18:38] With your permission, may I start the wedding ceremony?
Yes...
[18:43] Son, you can read these wedding documents if you want, this is your right.
[18:51] Go ahead, there is no need for that.
[18:54] Faizan Kamal, son of Safdar Kamal you are being married to Ramsha Ahmed, daughter of Murad Ahmed...
[19:04] in the presence of these witnesses, do you accept this?
[19:36] Yes...
[19:38] Faizan Kamal, son of Safdar Kamal you are being married to Ramsha Ahmed, daughter of Murad Ahmed for a dower of five crore rupees...
[19:46] in the presence of these witnesses, do you accept this?
[19:52] Yes.
[19:52] Faizan Kamal, son of Safdar Kamal you are being married to Ramsha Ahmed, daughter of Murad Ahmed for a dower of five crore rupees...
[20:01] in the presence of these witnesses, do you accept this?
[20:08] Yes...
[20:27] Many congratulations Faizan. Congratulations to you too.
[20:51] Bring the sweetmeats for Faizan. May God bless this union!
[21:32] Why is Natasha's phone off?
[21:36] She has never switched off her phone before. Is my daughter in some sort of trouble?
[21:46] Where are you going?
I...
[21:51] I just got the PNR for the tickets. I was thinking of telling Faizan and Hadia about their tickets to Islamabad. They have a surprise waiting for them there.
[22:02] Try thinking about your daughter for once. You don't care whether she's alive or not.
[22:11] I don't want to talk about her right now, please.
Safdar!
[22:15] She's your daughter, she's your honor.
Did she think about my honor? No, right?
[22:53] Five crores as the amount of the dower?
[22:59] I needed a fail-safe for my daughter's happiness and this is my wish.
[23:06] Fail-safe for what?
I don't want you leaving my daughter because of your first wife.
[23:15] If I wanted to leave her, then why would I have married her?
[23:19] You will do no such thing, but your father can do everything.
[23:26] What didn't he try to do to remove Ramsha from your life? I'm sure you didn't forget.
[23:33] And why are you so worried?
[23:40] You married Ramsha to stand by her for the rest of your life. You're not leaving her, then why are you worried about the dower?
[23:47] I have nothing in my hands, you know that.
You don't have it today, but you will have it someday.
[23:53] Ramsha is not asking it for today, whether it be a month, two months, or a couple of years...
[24:00] you can give it to her whenever you feel like it.
[24:04] You should have informed me.
I couldn't find the time, all of this happened so suddenly.
[24:11] Yesterday you agreed to marry her and today you got married. When should we have discussed this?
[24:18] Try and understand Faizan. Your first wife was chosen by your parents.
[24:26] She lives in your house and the entire world knows that she is your wife.
[24:31] But Ramsha, she doesn't have that. No one knows that she's Safdar Kamal's daughter-in-law, or if she's your wife.
[24:43] No one will accept her right.
[24:50] No one will acknowledge a relationship with her.
[24:53] And, if one day you refuse to acknowledge this marriage as well...
[24:57] then think about it, what will happen to my daughter, where will she go?
[25:03] In such a situation, you have to give my daughter the security of a safe future.
[25:34] Miss Hadia, Mr. Safdar is asking for you.
Sure.
[25:45] Father, you called me?
Yes, sit down.
[25:49] I've texted you something, check it out.
[25:54] I've booked your and Faizan's tickets to Islamabad. You two are going there on Friday. You guys have to check the land over there as well.
[26:03] The land you two will build your restaurant on.
[26:06] Thank you, father.
[26:09] I should thank brother Aleem... for giving me such an honorable and loving daughter.
[26:17] I'm lucky to have a daughter like you in my home.
[26:22] Announce this good news Faizan as well.
Sure father.
[27:15] What happened Faizan? Are you happy?
[27:21] Faizan, say something. Please.
[27:27] At least smile looking at me. Tell me how beautiful I am.
[27:44] I knew that you would smile like that looking at me.
[27:49] Faizan, today we are finally together, and I'm so happy, that I can't even explain it in words.
[28:02] Faizan, you feel the same way as well, right?
[28:07] I'll have to go.
[28:11] What?
[28:16] You'll leave me right now?
[28:22] We just got married and you'll leave right away.
[28:33] We'll have to go. I have to sit at the breakfast table in the morning. No one knows I'm gone.
[28:45] Faizan, will you leave me like this every day? I won't let you go.
[28:52] I am sorry.
[28:57] I know I'm wrong, it's not fair to you.
[29:04] But no one at home knows...
[29:08] about this marriage.
[29:13] We'll have to be cautious for some time.
[29:19] I have to go.
[30:40] You're back.
[30:51] You're still up?
I can't sleep without you.
[31:02] Why do you love me so much?
Why do you always ask me this question?
[31:08] Because I think that you're enduring a loss loving me so much.
[31:14] You are wasting your energy on me.
It's not like that.
[31:20] If you start loving me this way, this loss will become profitable.
[31:28] You must be tired, should I bring breakfast for you?
[31:33] Just get me tea, and I'll have breakfast with everyone else.
[31:37] Okay.
[31:42] How is your friend feeling now?
[31:52] Alright... he's fine now.
[31:57] Thank God.
[33:02] You'll go on a business trip to Islamabad, even though we just got married yesterday.
[33:08] And we should spend time with each other.
I have to go, I can't say no to my father.
[33:15] What is the matter? I've been noticing that your father has been involving you in business a lot.
[33:23] Yes, it's a good sign, right?
Yes, in a way it is.
[33:29] It's great in all ways. This way I'll learn the business and I won't have to ask my father for money.
[33:41] How many days are you going for?
[33:44] For a week?
What! Are you going for a business meeting or to attend a workshop?
[33:50] A week? The meeting will end in an hour and the travel isn't that long either. Then why a week?
[33:57] Father has his eye on some land for his restaurant. I have to visit it and work on it. I'm not going alone, Razi will be there with me as well.
[34:06] When are you going?
Tomorrow.
[34:12] Faizi, why don't you try to understand? I don't want to live without you anymore.
[34:22] I understand but please, be patient for a while.
[34:30] I think I should leave. It's an early morning flight, I've got to go.
[34:41] Will you not escort me out?
[34:49] Let's go.
[34:55] Greetings* How are you?
I called you to tell you that Faizan and I are leaving for Islamabad.
[35:03] That's good. May you two always be happy.
[35:07] Mother, your prayers are what has blessed my life.
[35:12] No, my dear, God is the one who does these things. We can only pray.
I'll visit you, once I come back.
[35:20] Sure... I'll wait for you.
Faizan is calling me, I'll talk to you later.
[35:27] Sure, take care.
Farewell.
[35:35] Who was it?
It was Hadia.
[35:39] Why did you hang up? I wanted to talk to her.
[35:42] I would have given it to you, but she was getting late for her flight.
[35:47] Alright fine.
Thank God that she's happy.
[35:54] God has accepted our prayers.
[35:58] Thank God that you're finally at peace. Otherwise, you were always so concerned over Faizan.
[36:05] I told you that one day his attitude would change.
[36:12] This has happened because of Haida.
You're right, this did happen because of Hadia.
[36:22] And... Safdar was praising Hadia as well.
[36:28] With all this praise to one side, I'm hungry. Please serve lunch.
Sure
[36:43] This time was mine. Faizan should have given me time.
[36:49] Why did he go to Islamabad leaving me here like this?
[36:53] But it's good that this father is involving him in business.
[37:00] This is good for me, but did he take Hadia with him?
[37:10] No, that can't be. Faizan can't lie to me.
[37:17] But it can happen.
[37:21] I need to find out why Faizan went to Islamabad.
[37:35] Alright, take care. Enjoy yourself.
[37:39] I'll miss you. Take care of him.
[37:44] Shall we?
[37:45] Okay...
[38:18] Hello... Ramsha what is it?
Zohaib...
[38:23] tell me, where has Faizan gone to?
[38:27] Alright, I'll call and find out.
[38:29] I don't know how you do it, but I want all of his updates in five minutes.
[38:37] Bye.
