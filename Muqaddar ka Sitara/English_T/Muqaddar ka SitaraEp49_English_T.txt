[01:11] oh mom, what happen?
[01:15] get me water
[01:24] oh God! you had gone to uncle so happily then what happened?
[01:38] nothing is right
[01:42] I am not getting positive vibes
[01:45] from whom?
[01:49] Safder & Sheena, whom else?
[01:54] what are you saying? I am not getting anything
[01:58] what shall I tell you?
[02:02] Sheena
[02:05] Sheena is asking for Razi's proposal
[02:08] what!
[02:10] what are you saying, mom?
[02:12] have you refused?
[02:15] yes
[02:16] thank God!
[02:19] but... 
[02:22] but now Safder
[02:26] Natasha wants to get married with Razi
[02:32] and you know how Sheena is
[02:35] she loves her daughter a lot
[02:38] she will make our life a living hell!
[02:41] I'm afraid, what if she harms my son
[02:47] God forbid
[02:49] but mom, what will we do now?
[02:53] what was the need to talk to my sister?
[02:55] why! You wanted Natasha to marry Razi, right?
[03:00] then what is the objection now?
[03:02]  it was a different matter at that time. Our daughter was unmarried
[03:06] she is a divorcee now
[03:08] the nerve, Safder!
[03:10] if you will use this word for your daughter, then others will also get a chance
[03:15] I am showing you the mirror, Sheena
[03:17] and I am telling you the truth that I have seen with my eyes
[03:20] Natasha is in love with Razi now, she had shared her feelings with me
[03:26] then you should have explained her
[03:28] or at least, you should have talked to me before talking to my sister
[03:32] why I should have talked to you? if your daughter likes someone then what's the harm in it?
[03:37] and now its your own nephew Razi, with whom you want to marry her
[03:41] really!
[03:43] this is what you are saying!
[03:45] who used to point out all the demerits in him
[03:53] I have digested this bitter truth for the sake of my daughter's happiness
[03:57] its of no use now, the situation has been changed
[04:01] the situation hasn't changed at all! They are still under the burden of our favors
[04:06] stop it Sheena!
[04:08] tell me one thing
[04:10] what do they want to prove by rejecting Natasha?
[04:15] whatever they have is given to them by us
[04:18] you are exaggerating the matter!
[04:20] I will talk to Natasha myself & will tell her not to think in this manner or be stubborn about it
[04:25] this is not her contumacy but her wish
[04:28] whatever it is, whether contumacy or wish
[04:30] I will explain my daughter in both the matters
[04:33] if something is not possible then it is not!
[04:35] as far as Natasha is concerned
[04:38]  her happiness is more precious to me than anything in this world
[04:41] because she is my only daughter
[04:51] fine! try talking to her
[04:54] she won't agree
[05:07] what kind of a problem is this!
[05:12] our fate is so bad, happiness doesn't suit my children
[05:20] don't worry
[05:24] God willing, God will make a way out
[05:26] I must say, we'll talk to aunt Sheena & uncle face to face once brother Razi comes
[05:32] call Razi
[05:34] and ask him where is he. Tell him to come home quickly
[05:38] yes, I am doing it. Please don't worry so much, your blood pressure will shoot up
[05:41] please drink water
[05:43] Okay
[05:45] I'm fine
[05:47] shall I give you medicine?
[05:48] yes
[05:55] what will happen!
[06:44] Razi!
[06:52] you cannot marry me because I am a divorcee?
[06:55] right?
[06:57] you have the right to refuse, Razi
[07:01] but tell me yourself
[07:03] just because of my single mistake
[07:07] can't I do something good in my life ever?
[07:09] I cannot spend a good life
[07:12] Natasha, when have I said that?
[07:16] if you haven't said that then accept me
[07:19] I love you a lot, Razi
[07:21] what are you saying? people will hear
[07:24] I don't care!
[07:26] I don't care about anyone anymore
[07:31] actually, I don't care about myself
[07:34] if you didn't say 'yes' to marry me, then I... 
[07:40] I will kill myself
[07:41] Natasha... 
[07:42] and I'm damn serious about it!
[07:44] please don't do this, what non-sense!
[07:47] what is this childish attitude? What is this misbehavior!
[07:50] this is not a childish act!
[07:54] as I said, I love you & I cannot live without you
[08:03] Natasha please! think wisely.. 
[08:07] come down for two minutes, we'll talk in peace Ok?
[08:10] what will we talk about?
[08:16] Natasha
[08:17] nobody will come inside
[08:19] Natasha, open the door
[08:21] otherwise, I will kill myself
[08:28] Natasha!
[08:41] uncle, look at Natasha... 
[08:42] what is she doing!
[08:44] what is this happening?
[08:44] Natasha, come down you will fall!
[08:47] Natasha!
[08:48] dad, please don't stop me
[08:51] I will kill myself today
[08:53] Razi doesn't loves me, he will not marry me & I cannot live without him
[08:58] Natasha, please don't do any such thing!
[09:02] look! I will talk to Razi
[09:04] I promise, he will marry you
[09:07] but please come down
[09:09] mom please stop lying to me, even aunt doesn't want this to happen
[09:14] dear, have some mercy on me please. Please come down
[09:19] dad, I'm telling you. I cannot live without Razi
[09:25] I will change myself as per his choice, but he is not agreeing
[09:30] sister, if something happened to my daughter then I will never forgive you
[09:33] dear Razi, please solve this matter for the sake of expedience
[09:38] yes uncle
[09:42] Natasha!
[09:44] fine! I am ready for this marriage
[09:47] I know, you are saying this to save me. You guys are lying to me
[09:53] I am not lying! see... 
[09:58] look! I've also brought a ring for you. I wanted to surprise you
[10:03] come down please!
[10:06] Natasha please come down, listen to your father
[10:10] Natasha... please
[10:14] I'm coming
[10:18] Natasha!
[10:20] Natasha... 
[10:26] where is it!
[10:29] don't know where have I kept it
[10:37] where it has gone?
[10:41] why are you sitting here with the bundle of documents?
[10:44] I don't know where... 
[10:47] have I kept my ID card, I've been searching for it since so long bu I can't find it
[10:52] you should have asked me, I would have told you. 
I know where is it
[10:57] wait, I am bringing it
[11:02] I've been looking for it madly since so long
[11:05] oh God!
[11:08] anyways... 
[11:12] here you go
[11:15] thank you!
[11:16] I had completely lost my mind while searching for it
[11:19] by the way, why were you searching your ID card?
[11:24] I'm thinking to go & get Fizza's migration done to another university
[11:32] so that she can start her studies once again
[11:36] yes, one more thing. Don't tell her about it
[11:42] let she get the admission first, and let me find a hostel for her
[11:46] then together we'll give her this good news
[11:50] yes
[11:52] better, I won't tell her
[11:55] but Fizza's documents are with her, how will do it?
[12:00] don't worry, Fizza's documents are already with me
[12:10] aren't we hurrying in getting her admission done once again?
[12:16] don't know why
[12:18] I'm scared of these educational institutions
[12:22] since Fizza had experienced this accident
[12:29] I start fearing by thinking that she will join another college
[12:32] I feel scared
[12:35] yes
[12:37] you are right
[12:39] even I was scared
[12:43] but after looking at Fizza's bravery & courage, even I've gained confidence
[12:49] and how wisely she did this decision of her life
[12:54] I think, we should appreciate her
[13:00] you also give her courage so that she shall become successful in her motive
[13:05] God willing
[13:08] Okay... 
[13:12] had they contacted again?
[13:16] No, it didn't happen
[13:18] its good!
[13:20] be careful... 
[13:23] it is better not have such kind of contact
[13:26] let she get the admission first
[13:29] God willing Fizza will handle everything on her own
[13:33] yes, sure
[13:36] Ok, let me clear this mess now
[13:47] thanks to God!
[14:14] hello!
[14:17] at least.. its not a big deal
[14:21] its a matter of 40 million
[14:30] at least get the stock released
[14:33] I can give you 10% profit
[14:36] on 40 million
[14:41] Okay
[15:14] understand, brother Salik?
[15:15] yes
[15:20] bro, I am so happy
[15:23] if brother Salik helped you, then you will beat Safder uncle in the business world
[15:33] hey you!
[15:34] what are you saying?
[15:35] man! I'm not joking. Stop laughing, you start laughing on every matter
[15:40] brother, I'm serious. Didn't you see that guy
[15:43] he gave 10% profit on an investment of 40 million
[15:47] I wish I had that much amount then I would be earning so easily
[15:50] I mean the guy seems legit
[15:51] yes, of course he is
[15:53] in fact, I am thinking to take 5 crores from you & do an investment with Salik
[15:58] from me? a loan?
[15:59] can't you do this much for your friend?
[16:02] just think, do the math
[16:04] I will give 5 crores, and we'll get a profit of 50 lacs on it. Right brother?
[16:07] slowly & gradually I will return your money
[16:41] dear, at that time I had asked you many times to get married
[16:46] if you had listened to me on that day, then we wouldn't have to face this day
[16:54] did you see?
[16:56] what that crazy girl has done to herself
[17:01] you are so late
[17:32] Natasha like Razi
[17:37] even he?
[17:39] I pray to God that Natasha must be fine
[18:19] do get an idea from his talks that what he has decided
[18:25] if he will give the money to Salik
[18:28] then its confirmed then
[18:31] first of all explain me
[18:34] that how will he give the money?
[18:36] he doesn't even have a single penny
[18:41] you are right. He doesn't have his own money
[18:44] but he gathers the money somehow by doing different frauds
[18:48] even he spends a lot of money on his luxuries
[18:51] and he will arrange the money for sure for such kind of offer
[18:58] I don't know Zohaib, but I don't find any direct profit in this
[19:04] really!
[19:06] do you think his intentions will change after taking 50 lacs every month?
[19:10] yes?
[19:12] its just the matter of time
[19:15] you'll see, he will do a big fraud with his dad's account
[19:19] and that big fraudulent amount will come to you
[19:24] hmm... 
[19:27] so, do you accept that I am your best friend?
[19:33] well Ms. Ramsha millionaire
[19:37] don't forget your friend
[19:41] absolutely not!
[19:47] you are such a greedy person
[20:18] hello!
[20:21] calm down Faizan, where are you? What happen?
[20:27] Ok fine, send me the location I'm coming
[20:30] yes
[20:32] what happen?
[20:33] don't know Faizan is calling me
[20:35] I'm not greedy, aunty
[20:40] stupid guy!
[20:42] he is making us a fool
[20:43] relax mom, we'll see. First let our work get done
[20:49] he wants his share
[20:51] leave him!
[21:30] I've been calling your incompetent son since so long
[21:32] but he isn't responding at all!
[21:41] great! now he has switched it off
[21:44] what kind of a son he is?
what kind of a brother he is?
[21:47] his sister is in the hospital & what is he doing!
[21:51] how would he know that his sister is in the hospital?
[21:53] instead of calling him, you are cursing your son
[21:59] what else shall I do?
[22:00] God had to give me such an incompetent children
[22:04] I don't understand anything
[22:06] what's with you, Safder? Is this the right time to say such things?
[22:10] leave it
[22:11] sister, they haven't left me a chance
[22:14] look, we've reached to this extent because of all of them
[22:18] I don't understand anything
[22:20] its a hospital, please
[22:22] aunt... 
[22:25] aunt, I've brought juice for you. Please drink it
[22:29] I don't want!
[22:31] you are already in stress, you will fall sick please
[22:35] as I said, I don't need your false sympathies!
[22:48] I am not showing sympathy
[22:51] I am really worried about you
[23:31] there is nothing to worry about
[23:33] her arm got fractured, and there is a minor injury on the left leg
[23:37] thanks to God that there hasn't been any major loss
[23:39] thanks to God a million times
[23:42] the main thing is that there isn't any serious head injury
[23:46] but still we need to get her scans done
[23:48] sure! do whatever you feel is better
[23:52] Can we meet her?
[23:53] yes sure, you can go
[23:56] come
[24:08] my child...
[24:10] Natasha, what was this? what if something would have happened to you then?
[24:15] what's her fault in it?
[24:17] all of this is done by your nephew & sister
[24:21] what was the problem if your sister hadn't refused for the marriage?
[24:24] as it is, his son is not someone very special
[24:28] what quality my daughter lacks?
[24:30] stop it Sheena!
[24:32] at least think before you speak, you start everywhere!
[24:35] be quiet!
[24:37] how can you ask me to be quiet?
[24:40] who would have been responsible if something would have happened to my daughter?
[24:46] mom, I am responsible
[24:49] its my mistake
[24:51] aunt & Razi aren't our slaves
[24:54] that whatever we will ask them to do, they will do
[24:58] Razi has got complete right to refuse
[25:02] and aunt has got complete right to chose her daughter in law
[25:05] the entire fault is mine
[25:08] I consider it my right to achieve everything
[25:14] dad, I'm really sorry
[25:17] I want to apologize to you for all of my mistakes
[25:24] actually I have started to fall in love with Razi
[25:28] and have started to become like the same person as he wants me to be
[25:33] the way he took me out of Sherry's trap
[25:37] I thought, maybe he will accept me too
[25:42] but its not necessary
[25:44] I can be his very good cousin too
[26:07] Razi, I'm really sorry
[26:12] I won't force you anymore
[26:19] you are free to marry the person of your choice
[26:27] how can he back off so easily?
[26:29] he had said at home that he will marry you. Also, he had brought a ring for you
[26:34] make her wear the ring then!
[26:42] there is no need of it, Sheena
[26:44] our daughter has realized her mistake, & that's enough for us
[26:48] I am proud of my daughter
[26:51] stay blessed dear
[26:55] and don't ever do this mistake ever, please!
[26:58] I had almost lost my life!
[27:03] my son will not back off
[27:12] if he has agreed to marry
[27:15] then he will marry for sure
[27:25] yes!
[27:27] make her wear the ring
[29:36] congratulations to you too Razi
[30:48] first uncle has pressurized me & now you
[30:51] at least you should have supported me
[30:54] what do you mean?
[30:57] if you were not agreed for this proposal then
[31:01] why were you showing that ring to Natasha?
[31:05] mom, I had brought that ring for Farwa not for Natasha
[31:09] I had lied to Natasha, in order to save her life
[31:15] please
[31:17] I don't want to marry Natasha
[31:20] if I had to marry Natasha, then I wouldn't have asked to look for a proposal for me
[31:40] what happen? what did the doctor said? are the scans report here?
[31:44] sister, the scanning report will take some time. And for now, they want to keep Natasha under observation
[31:49] dear Razi, do one thing
