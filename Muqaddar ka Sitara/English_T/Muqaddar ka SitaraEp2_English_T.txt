[01:08] uncle is coming after such a long time
[01:11] yes, true that
[01:14] do you remember, when he came last time. Our entire neighborhood gathered to see his shining car
[01:21] because my brother's car was so nice
[01:24] leave the car. Look at his lavish house
[01:31] I think, his drawing room is equivalent to our entire house
[01:38] his house is so nice, right?
we get to see such houses in films & dramas only
[01:43] yes
[01:46] it seems somebody is there, go check
[01:50] it must be brother Razi
[01:51] so won't you open the door for Razi?
[01:53] I will...
come on, go
[02:13] greetings!
[02:17] greetings to you too!
[02:21] chaat, my favorite! thank you!
[02:30] look at this, my favorite chaat. let me serve it
[02:34] Okay fine
[02:38] greetings mom!
[02:39] greetings to you too! stay blessed my son
[02:42] what's the matter? You got so late today
[02:52] actually I had gone to the property dealer
[02:55] uncle had asked me to get a house in defence
[03:00] in defence? but for whom?
[03:05] for us
[03:07] for us?
[03:09] but dear, how come for us? We are not so rich to take a house there
[03:17] mom, uncle has given me a new job in his company
[03:20] he wants us to shift over there, because the office is quite far from there
[03:27] that's fine, we cannot ignore what he had said but...
[03:31] how will we pay so much of rent? It must be so expensive over there
[03:37] mom, I tried to explain him a lot. But he didn't listen to me
[03:42] he is saying, no need to worry about the rent. The company will pay
[03:47] Okay
[03:51] what can I say? We cannot ignore your uncle
[03:55] anyways, go & freshen up. Meanwhile let me get the tea prepared
[03:59] I won't drink only tea, ask her to serve chaat too. Otherwise, she will eat all
[04:03] No, she is serving it
[04:05] Farwa, dear prepare a cup of tea & bring chaat along with it
[04:13] dad
[04:14] thank you!
yes dear
[04:16] do you remember David?
[04:21] he used to be my class fellow in the US
[04:27] you are still in contact with him? Its been two years that we came back
[04:32] anyways, so yesterday he proposed me & I said yes
[04:40] what rubbish you are talking!
[04:44] are you in your senses, Natasha?
[04:48] what happen? What wrong have I said?
[04:49] by thinking what you've accepted his proposal?
[04:52] you didn't bother to tell us before taking such a big decision?
[04:56] so, I'm telling you now
[04:57] now! when you've said yes
[04:59] dad look! I am not a kid, I can take my own decisions
[05:04] I've got a guy after such a long time, who is like minded & understands me
[05:10] and I shall leave him because you've got objections with him
[05:15] he is leaving his religion for me
[05:22] Natasha...
[05:29]  the biryani is good
[05:43] why are you taking so much of tension of the kids?
[05:46] they are naive, with time they will be wise
[05:51] at first I was worried about Faiza, & now Natasha
[05:54] Sheena, I wish you would have done their right brought up. Then we wouldn't have to see this day
[06:00] and neither these tensions
[06:02] not only mother but father is also answerable in children upbringing
[06:17] mom
[06:20] I love David, I cannot live without him. Please help me a bit
[06:24] Natasha, this is not possible. You know marrying David is not possible
[06:30] and neither I want this to happen
[06:32] then even I don't care
[06:34] Natasha, why don't you get my point?
[06:37] when I've told you that you cannot marry David, then you cannot!
[06:41] we have to live in this society & in this country
[06:43] mom, you guys need to stop pressurizing me
[06:46] and I swear to God, if I didn't marry David then i will die
[07:05] mom
[07:06] yes
[07:07] uncle & his family has left, they must be arriving soon
[07:09] Razi just told me, I know
[07:14] do you know, I've informed all my friends that my uncle is coming
[07:18] you'll see, the entire neighborhood will gather to see his car
[07:23] by the way, does he have the same car or he has changed it?
[07:27] how would I know? we'll get to know once he comes
[07:30] right now, I'm preparing my brother's favorite food
[07:35] in which there is curry rice, meatballs, & eggplant
[07:40] and I'm cooking chinese for sister in law & kids
[07:43] by the way mom, you are doing a lot of hard work
[07:46] aunt Sheena is so diet conscious. If she didn't like it & said that
[07:51] uff! there are a lot of calories in it & I can't eat. Then?
[07:55] don't worry, I've prepared as per her taste
[07:57] if you are done talking, then go & check the drawing room
[08:00] do the dusting, it should be spic & span. You know how your aunt is
[08:04] you make me do a lot of work
[08:49] I feel so hopeless after meeting Sheena & he kids
[08:52] I thought, she must have changed as per her age
[08:57] by the way, aunt is so smart. She looks so young as per her age
[09:03] yes, even her daughter is like her. The same nature & attitude
[09:08] leave it mom, why do we care!
[09:17] mom, don't be upset
[09:19] soon we are about to shift in a house in defence. Not as big as theirs but we will have a house too
[09:26] and yes, tomorrow uncle has invited us on the dinner
[09:28] really! to his house?
[09:31] it will be fun
[09:32] but Sheena didn't tell me
[09:35] maybe she doesn't know about it
[09:37] what do you mean?
[09:38] I mean, its not necessary that uncle discusses all his plans with aunt
[09:43] he liked it so he invited us, that's it!
[09:45] oh! So it means that uncle has changed a lot
[09:51] maybe Sheena had mind it that Safder has given you a job in his office on a very good position
[09:57] and he is getting us shifted too. By the way, I am a bit afraid
[10:02] what if Safder asks me about his children marriage
[10:08] mom, why are you thinking this way? There is a lot of difference in our class, they are quite rich people
[10:14] as it is, he will wed off his kids as per his status
[10:16] dear, do you know my brother is not like that
[10:19] he has showed his desire of marrying his kids in the family
[10:25] and I am feeling so anxious while thinking about it
[10:27] what if my brother said this to me, then how will I refuse him?
[10:32] this marriage cannot happen!
[10:35] like this! what's a big deal?
[10:38] do you even know, your uncle has done so many favors on us
[10:41] after your father's demise, he used to take care of this house expense on regular basis
[10:47] and then he used to fulfill the expense of the education of you both
[10:53] what are you guys talking about!
[10:56] I remember, tomorrow I am going to Hyderabad with uncle to uncle Aleem's house
[10:59] do pay my regards to Khadija, its been ages that I met her
[11:04] we had met in some wedding
yes
[11:08] please sit & talk, I'm coming
[11:12] would you like to have green tea?
[11:14] yes, make it. I was about to ask you for the same
let me bring it
[11:18] I'm so tired today
[11:22] everything got so changed
[11:25] I can see new things
[11:27] I can't believe this is the same place where I had spent my childhood
[11:31] yes uncle, you are right
[11:33] by the way, you should do some shopping for aunt on our way back
[11:38] Okay
[11:40] do you visit brother Aleem's house?
[11:42] No uncle
[11:44] I'm going there with you for the first time. But yes, mom & Farwa had met them
[11:50] in some wedding. But after that they couldn't meet
[11:54] but you are going there as if you visit there frequently
[11:58] google maps
[11:59] oh ok ok
[12:03] lets go
[12:23] Guddu! Guddu, check who is there on the gate
[12:31] Guddu!
[12:43] yes, who?

[12:51] tell me, who are you & whom do you want to meet?
[12:56] hello!
[12:58] don't you speak?
[13:03] dear, are you Hadia?
[13:07] and you are Safder uncle!
[13:11] go, call your father
[13:13] greetings uncle!
[13:14] greetings to you too!
[13:15] please come in
[13:17] Okay...

[13:21] lets go
[13:35] sorry uncle, I couldn't recognize you
[13:38] no problem dear
[13:40] you have recognized me after so many years, & this much love of yours is enough is for me
[13:45] stay blessed
[13:46] dad is not at home, let me call him & ask him to come. But first, let me call mom
[13:50] mom.. mom, see who is here
[13:54] what happen Hadia?
[13:56] come & see outside
[13:58] greetings, sister
[13:59] greetings to you too! brother you!

[14:03] just now
[14:04] why are you standing outside? Come in
[14:08] you made uncle stand outside
[14:10] actually I...
[14:14] please come in. Do one thing, call your father & don't tell him that brother is here
[14:21] Okay
[14:22] he will be happy to see you, please come
[14:25] sister, there is a boy standing outside at the gate. It would be good if you can call him in
[14:32] Hadia... go & bring him in
[14:35] sorry, let me bring him in
[14:38] please come in
[15:22] please come in
[15:24] do you treat your guests in this manner?
[15:29] sorry
[15:33] but now I won't come inside
[15:36] how would I know that you came to meet dad
[15:41] I haven't told you even now
[15:43] that I came to meet your dad
[15:45] yes, but now I've understood
[15:49] what you've understood?
[15:52] that you are not our guest, but you've come along with our special guest
[15:57] that's why...
Hadia
[16:02] please come in
[16:08] Ok fine, I'll see
bye!
[16:11] this girl...
[16:13] he is such a weird guy
[16:15] about whom you are talking? What happen?
[16:17] the one who came with Safder uncle, he was looking at me so weirdly
[16:21] oh... maybe he is Safder uncle's son. His name is Faizan
[16:27] is he Safder uncle's son?
yes
[16:32] ok come in the kitchen, lets make tea
[16:35] come
[16:37] its fun to give surprise to someone
[16:40] you are absolutely correct
[16:42] but if you would have informed before coming then we would have done some arrangements for your welcome and...
[16:47] I would have asked your sister in law to prepare your favorite food
[16:50] that's why I haven't told you, so that you don't do any formality
[16:55] oh brother, what kind of formality?
[16:58] what do you think? Will we let you go without having anything? Absolutely not!
[17:03] let me do the preparations for lunch
[17:05] till date I am a fan of the delicious food cooked by you
[17:08] now your sister in law is retired from the kitchen
[17:13] now everything is handled by Hadia, the kitchen as well as the house
[17:17] and when you'll eat the food cooked by her, then you'll forget the taste of your sister in law's cooking
[17:24] this is not possible that I shall forget my sister in law's cooking
[17:29] Razi, I still remember various dishes cooked by her
[17:37] such as curry rice, egg plants etc. How can I forget them?
[17:43] I accept that the time is less, but I will definitely cook something of your choice
[17:48] by the way brother, I've one complain
[17:52] you haven't brought your wife along with you
[17:54] she will come soon
[17:58] for now Sheena has sent few gifts for sister in law & your daughters
[18:03] Razi, go & get the gifts from the car
[18:05] yes uncle, let me bring them
[18:11] Razi seems quite an obedient child
[18:15] and now Faizan and Natasha would have grown up too
[18:19] yes, since the kids are growing up so we have to get old
[18:23] I've become old
[18:25] I've got white hair, but you are still young
[18:29] what are you saying!
[18:38] sister.. 
[18:39] yes
[18:40] be quick, why are you taking so long to make tea
[18:42] at least do your work properly. You couldn't fry these kebabs in half an hour
[18:47] I've fried the samosas too, you just come here to eat
[18:53] you know I can't do house chores, specially kitchen related work
[18:57] still you & mom ask me to take care of the kitchen. I won't be able to become a doctor like this
[19:01] give it to me
[19:03] No, I'm doing it leave
[19:04] you are burning the kebabs, quickly take out the tea in the cups
[19:11] Safder uncle should have informed before coming, so that we could done the arrangements
[19:16] Ok talk less & work more. Be quick
[19:18] Okay... by the way fry one kebab for me. I also want to eat
[19:26] I was joking, what happen to you!
[20:04] be quick, sister
[20:18] what was the need to do a lot of formality?
[20:23] it was enough that you came to meet me from so far
[20:28] say thanks to your wife from my side
[20:30] sure
[20:32] Razi, how is your mother? Its been ages that I met her
[20:37] yes, they are fine
[20:42] Next time, I will bring them for sure
[20:44] she was paying her regards to you
[20:47] yes sure... ok tell me how is Farwa?
[20:50] she must be grown up. What is she doing?
[20:54] Farwa... recently she has completed her studies
[20:58] she helps mom in the house
that's great!
[21:04] Razi looks like your son more than your nephew. He is so intelligent like you
[21:12] you are right. I tell everyone that I have not one but 2 sons
[21:18] Faizan's number comes after Razi
[21:23] do you know, he & Faizan will look after my business after me
[21:29] and you'll see that he will prove to be a better businessman than me
[21:33] may God keep this love intact within you people
[21:37] Amen
amen!
[21:38] keep praying like this for us
[21:42] here comes the tea on a very good time
greetings!
[21:44] greetings to you too dear!
[21:55] how is the school going?
[21:57] very nice! I would have taken you for a visit if it was operational
[22:01] next time
[22:03] Ok tell me, what are your plans after graduation?
[22:07] I've planned to do private Masters
[22:09] stay blessed
[22:18] Ok, serve the tea then do the preparations for lunch
[22:22] Okay mom
[22:36] brother, please take something
[22:38] yes
[22:40] dear, don't put more sugar
[22:42] Okay
[23:22] what happened?
[23:24] Guddu, what are you doing with my Sonu?
[23:27] I've to sacrifice your Sonu today
[23:30] what! you will slay my Sonu?
[23:34] its your father's order, sister
[23:35] don't you dare to touch my Sonu ever
[23:38] the entire cage is filled with chickens, but all you can see is my Sonu
[23:42] he is the most healthy, and we make bar b q of the most healthiest
[23:47] if you kept a bad eye on my Sonu, then I will break your arms
[23:51] leave it. Leave!
[23:53] go!
[23:56] sorry sorry.. I hope you are not hurt
[23:59] you should have been walking carefully
[24:02] I'm extremely sorry
[24:05] actually I was busy in a message, so I didn't get to know. Sorry!
[24:12] is there any mosque nearby?
[24:18] do you offer prayers too?
[24:21] what do you mean?
[24:23] don't you think that I am a Muslim?
[24:28] No.. I didn't mean that
[24:34] Thanks to God
[24:36] I pray 5 times a day
[24:39] that's great!
[24:42] there is a mosque in the next street
[24:47] thank you!
[24:49] listen!
[24:50] yes
[24:53] nothing!
[24:55] thank you!
[25:06] I've come to my ancestral land after such a long time
[25:15] it feels as if I've gone back to my past
[25:20] everything is same
[25:24] the same familiarity
[25:28] the same our loved ones
[25:31] the same fragrance
[25:33] Safder... our land, its mud & its people are different
[25:41] you are right
[25:45] brother Aleem, I know we don't have facilities over here like we had in America
[25:50] neither we have clean water to drink
[25:53] nor we have abundance of electricity
[25:56] also the health related facilities are in front of you
[26:00] but still...
[26:05] they are our people
[26:09] and our land
[26:12] I didn't observe this much familiarity anywhere in the entire world
[26:17] you are absolutely correct!
[26:20] I remember my childhood after listening to you
[26:24] do you remember, you used to like the sweetmeats prepared by my mother
[26:34] what have you remind me!
[26:41] how can I forget the taste of the things made by her hands
[26:46] may God bless her with the highest place in the paradise
[26:51] shall I tell you something?
[26:53] my daughter Hadia makes exactly the same sweetmeats like her granny used to make
[26:59] she had learnt it from her
[27:00] that's great!
[27:03] our childhood days were so carefree
[27:09] a lot of worries are there to achieve success
[27:16] we've forgotten everything in the greed of earning money
[27:23] believe me even today
[27:27] whenever I look back
[27:30] now I realize that
[27:33] the real beauty was this
[27:39] absolutely!
[27:42] Safder, its been more than a year that you've moved to Karachi
[27:48] So, what are you doing in business?
[27:52] brother Aleem, I have started with the leather factory
[27:56] now I want to do something for charity
[28:00] I have a plan to build a mosque in Hyderabad
[28:04] and I've planned to make a hospital too
[28:10] that's great! may God give you success
[28:17] Safder, there is something in my mind so I thought to ask you
[28:23] yes yes
[28:24] look... sister Sheena had lived in America for so many years. So its obvious, that she must be habitual of that environment
[28:33] and... even your kids grew up over there
[28:38] now, will you go back to America if they didn't like staying here?
[28:45] brother Aleem, I came here after burning all the bridges
[28:49] now I have no plans of going back
[28:52] I've planned to stay in my country with my people
[28:59] I want to live here and..
[29:03] also want to die here
[29:06] Besides, I want to get my children married here
[29:31] what happened, Razi? Is there any problem or so?
[29:35] uncle. don't know I am not getting anything. The car isn't starting
[29:39] dear, if its big problem then there is a mechanic nearby. Call him & show the problem
[29:45] No uncle, actually its a computerized car. An ordinary mechanic won't be able to fix it
[29:51] it requires a specific machine
[29:54] dear, that's why I was asking you to take the driver along. He would have solved these petty issues
[30:00] its not a big problem. Stay here for tonight, tomorrow morning we will show the car in some showroom
[30:07] No, there is no need of it. Thank you very much. Lets hire a private car
[30:12] the driver will come in the morning & get the car
[30:16] do you have an emergency? 
Stay here for tonight, I will take you for a school visit in the morning
[30:21] also I will show you the land I have in mind for the hospital
[30:25] as it is, Razi came here after so many years
[30:33] stay here for my sake
[30:38] as it is, we get happiness with a lot of difficulty
[30:46] No uncle, what are you saying? You are making me feel guilty
[30:50] I will obey you order. We will stay here
[30:55] Ok now close the car's bonnet. 
let's go & sit inside
[31:02] dad had called
[31:04] his car broke down, so he will stay in Hyderabad
[31:08] but dad couldn't sleep anywhere else than his bed
[31:12] and I've heard that the condition of their house is not good, even they don't have AC
[31:17] thanks God that I haven't been there, otherwise I had to stay as well
[31:21] their house condition is way too bad
[31:26] you can find animals more than humans
[31:30] I feel so annoyed with such people
[31:33] even after getting a lot of education, its of no use
[31:36] they have made their daughters groovy even after educating them a lot
[31:41] I don't understand, how come dad enjoys his company?
[31:46] your dad cannot hear a single word against his villager friends
[31:52] don't know what magic they have caste on him
[31:54] last time when he had visited them, he was praising them 24/7
[31:58] in fact, he is such a big fan of Khadija's cooking
[32:03] I swear! I get quite bothered by their hospitality
[32:08] they force us to eat, and if we refuse then they mind it. I mean we are not hungry & we don't want to eat
[32:13] what's there to mind?
[32:15] I swear to God! that's so stupid & annoying
[32:19] even aunt's house has same condition, both of them are same to same
[32:23] I know the reason behind your aunt's hospitality
[32:27] she does this for her own benefit
[32:29] they have been living their entire life on our charity
[32:33] Razi became independent just now
[32:36] otherwise, after brother Arshad's death your father took care of their entire expenses
[32:40] he used to send dollars from America, and they have been living a luxurious life here
[33:17] yes, who?
[33:19] who do you want to meet?
[33:23] tell me, who are you & whom do you want to meet?
[33:38] yes
[33:48] sir, milk
[33:49] hey no... I don't want it. Thank you!
[33:53] do you want something else?
[33:54] No, thank you!
[34:20] do you treat your guests in this manner?
[34:23] how would I know that you came to meet dad
[34:28] I haven't told you even now
[34:30] that I came to meet your dad
[34:33] who is telling you jokes secretly, that you are smiling?
[34:36] Fizza, you haven't slept as of yet?
[34:39] I saw you smiling while I was about to sleep
[34:42] tell me something, who was making you smile?
[34:44] don't talk too much, go to sleep
[34:47] Ok, I will go to sleep. But first tell me
[34:50] Aren't the angels tickling you in your dreams, the way they do to small kids
[34:54] you talk so rubbish, Fizza
[34:58] anyways, tell me something. If I ask you something, then won't you get angry?
[35:05] say it
[35:06] first, promise me that you won't be angry
[35:09] now say it
[35:10] how do you find Safder uncle?
[35:13] he is a very nice person
[35:15] he is so down to earth although he is so rich
[35:19] I have seen such kind of a person first time in my life
[35:22] right?
[35:23] he is very nice
[35:24] and... what about his son Faizan?
[35:30] what do you mean?
[35:31] I like brother Faizan a lot, he is very nice & decent just like his father
[35:36] thanks to God that he is not like his mother, egoistic. Otherwise, he would have been status conscious at all times
[35:41] don't say this, its not a good thing
[35:43] but I'm right. Look! he is so nice, decent and handsome
[35:48] he is such a nice person
[35:49] anyways, he is not that handsome
[35:52] really! by the way... he was looking at you secretly
[35:57] when we sitting at the dining table for the dinner, his focus was more on you that the food
[36:03] I think, he likes you
[36:06] by the way, tell me something. What if he likes you and he asks Safder uncle to bring a marriage proposal for you then?
[36:12] it will be so good. You will get married into such a rich family
[36:17] wow!
[36:18] don't talk non-sense. He won't think that way at all
[36:21] as it is, there is a lot of difference in our status
[36:24] oh sister! all of these things doesn't matter
[36:27] if it would have mattered, then Safder uncle wouldn't have been friends with our father
[36:32] as it is, my sixth sense says that not only brother Faizan, But you also like him
[36:40] Fizza, fix yourself!
[36:43] look! such things happen with the people who speaks the truth
[36:47] if you like someone then accept it, say it in front of all that you like him. What's wrong in it?
[36:53] you can't do a single word, but you can talk non-stop at all times
[36:57] if you can't sleep then go & knead the dough for puris
[37:00] Safder uncle has requested to prepare Halwa Puri in the breakfast
[37:03] he has requested you not me
[37:06] so, neither I will knead the dough nor I will make the puris. Do it yourself, I am sleeping
[37:11] I will see you in the morning, free loader!
[37:25] Cherry, have you eaten your food?
[37:28] Sonu, you also eat something. 
Why he isn't eating anything since yesterday?
[37:31] this poor guy is upset because yesterday his fiance was martyred
[37:37] oh Guddu! you've martyred is fiance?
[37:41] didn't you feel ashamed while separating two loved ones?
[37:44] sister, separation was written in their fate
[37:47] if she hadn't died, then Sonu would have been sacrificed
[37:51] after all, it was important to prepare tikka for the kids
[37:54] you are so cruel! you've slayed his fiance
[38:07] even I like to pet the animals like you
[38:18] whenever you will come to my house
[38:20] then I will make you meet my pets
[38:23] the difference is that, I haven't kept their names like you have done
[38:28] now I'm thinking to keep their names
[38:32] So, will you help me in keeping their names?
[38:36] I haven't kept their names, Gudda has named them
[38:39] sister takes very good care of them, and love them a lot
[38:43] she gives them food with her own hands
[38:46] sometimes sister Fizza also give them food
[38:48] but Sonu... he only eats with sister's hands
[38:57] Guddu
[38:58] yes sir!
lets go Sonu
[39:09] So...
[39:12]  what names Gudda has kept?
[39:17] this one is Cuckoo...
[39:21] and the one next to it is Pinky
[39:23] and this is Cherry
[39:26] Okay
[39:28] he stays very angry
[39:31] can I hold it?
[39:35] as I said, he is always angry so he minds
[39:39] so give it to me
[39:41] I hope he won't be angry
