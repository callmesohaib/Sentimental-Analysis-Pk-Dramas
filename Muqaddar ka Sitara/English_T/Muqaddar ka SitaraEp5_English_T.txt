[01:16] You're right. If this is the case, you should have brought along sister Shina.
[01:22] Of course, you're right. As I said, she'll visit in a few days.
[01:29] I came here to resolve matters of the mosque with brother Aleem.
[01:35] While I was here, I decided to tell you what was going on in my heart.
[01:43] Can we answer you back after talking to each other about it?
[01:48] But I want the answer to be yes.
[01:53] I want to make Hadia my daughter-in-law and take her away from here, today.
[02:12] So that's why you were so shy.
[02:17] Brother Faizan turned out to be very clever, he sent a proposal so quickly.
[02:20] Silence yourself, someone will hear you.
[02:23] This is called true love. Are you shy?
Enough!
[02:35] Did you serve the tea?
Yes, and everyone praised the tea as well.
[02:48] I want to marry Faizan and Hadia...
[02:52] as soon as possible.
[02:55]  Don't worry, there will be no shortage on our end.
[03:00] She'll have every luxury in this world. 
[03:03] I'm not talking here away from here as my daughter-in-law...
[03:07] but as my daughter. That is my promise to you.
[03:13] Yes, brother, there is no doubt about that, but...
[03:16] we haven't seen Faizan in such a long time.
[03:21] We saw him when he was a child, and that was a long time ago. 
[03:25] Also, we need to take Hadia's approval as well.
[03:31] Yes sure... ask Hadia. Let her ask, I don't have any objections.
[03:39] Khadija, Safdar is my childhood friend...
[03:45] You know that and it's hard to find a good man like him.
[03:52] Obviously, his son would be like him. As far as Hadia is concerned, I know...
[04:01] that whatever decision we take for her, she'll accept it. 
[04:06] We won't be able to find a better proposal for her than this.
[04:14] Now bring something sweet.
[04:19] But...
No buts... this is a moment of happiness...
[04:25] And I've never let Safdar return empty-handed and...
[04:32] I won't let him return empty-handed today...
[04:36] Bring something sweet.
[04:52] She is a mother, and she's bound to be a little cautious.
[05:08] Brother Aleem, I think that sister has some concerns over Shina. She didn't seem happy.
[05:17] It's nothing like that Safdar. 
[05:20] Women are bound to say something.
Brother Aleem, believe me...
[05:27] My son is a smart and sober man.
[05:33] He's helping me out with my business...
[05:38] I have decided to hand over a franchise to him.
[05:43] He's come here from abroad, so he's a little different. But he is a man of simple taste.
[05:50] As far as Shina is concerned, I'll bring her here next time.
[05:55] I told you...
Safdar...
[05:59] why are you explaining yourself? 
[06:02] I know that your son is just like you.
[06:07] And I have no worries regarding Faizan in my heart.
[06:15] Thank you.
[06:49] Greetings...
[06:52] It seems you were waiting for my call.
No, it's nothing like that.
[06:57] I was near the phone, that's why I picked it up on the first ring.
[07:01] It seems you tend to live in false happiness.
[07:06] And only you have the treatment for this sickness.
[07:10] What sickness and what treatment?
[07:13] Just tell me, what does your heart say to you about me?
[07:17] Think that my sickness will cure itself if you tell me.
[07:23] I think your sickness is untreatable.
[07:28] No...
[07:31] Hadia, if I ask you a question, will you answer me honestly?
[07:37] How do I seem to you?
What if I don't answer?
[07:42] Then don't.
[07:44] Whatever you wish... but Hadia...
[07:48] I know that the emotions I have for you are similar to the emotions you have for me.
[07:54] The only difference is that you hesitate in expressing them, but one day you'll have to.
[08:01] I know that...
[08:04] Hadia... believe me...
[08:09] My emotions for you are pure.
[08:14] I've fallen in love with you...
[08:17] Not only do I love you, but I respect you with all my heart.
[08:22] Believe me...
[08:25] You will not regret marrying me, I promise you...
[08:30] Are you listening?
[08:34] Hello...
[08:37] Hello...
[09:05] You shouldn't have agreed so quickly. You could have at least asked for more time.
[09:10] We should have asked Hadia, you agreed without asking her.
[09:13] He asked for Hadia's hand so respectfully, that I wasn't able to refuse.
[09:20] You were wrong to do that. 
[09:22] I'm not saying that you should have refused but you should have asked for more time.
[09:27] I can't imagine my daughter being Shina's daughter-in-law. You know how she is...
[09:34] She didn't even come here, Lord knows how she will treat my daughter.
[09:40] Tell me, what do we know about Faizan, we haven't even met him. 
[09:46] He's come here from abroad...
[09:48] We don't know how nature is... will Hadia be able to manage with him, or not?
[09:55] Don't worry about Faizan...
[09:59] He's Safdar Kamal's son...
[10:02] And like how daughters resemble their mothers, similarly sons are just like their fathers.
[10:10] Safdar was telling me that he is a smart and sober man.
[10:16] And he helps out Safdar in his business as well.
[10:21] I don't know...
[10:23] My heart doesn't agree with this. It feels that we're doing something wrong.
[10:29] You shouldn't have agreed so quickly...
Khadija...
[10:34] Don't worry for no reason. Everything will be alright, have faith in God.
[10:40] And we'll meet Faizan in a few days, and as far as Hadia is concerned...
[10:47] I won't take any decision against her will...
[10:53] I will go and talk to her right now.
[10:56] Alright?
[11:18] Hadia, my dear.
[11:21] Father, you should have called me.
Keep sitting.
[11:29] I needed to talk to you.
[11:34] Sure, father...
You know how Safdar and I are old friends.
[11:40] And now he wants that we turn this friendship into a relationship.
[11:50] To tell you the truth, I want this as well.
[11:55] He was here to ask your hand in marriage for his son.
[12:00] I have no objections to this proposal.
[12:05] But, before I give a final answer, I'd like to know your opinion.
[12:13] Without it, I will take no decision.
Whatever you and mother decide...
[12:19] I will accept it.
[12:24] Bless you, my dear.
[12:28] May God bless you with happiness.
[12:54] Uncle, you went to Hyderabad yesterday?
[12:57] Yes, I had to go there to take care of documentation for our mosque. 
[13:03] I also met my brother Aleem and talked to him about Faizan's marriage.
[13:10] I needed to talk to brother Aleem...
[13:17] but I decided that I should take your advice first.
[13:19] Coincidentally I need your advice as well, rather I have an announcement.
[13:24] What kind of announcement?
[13:27] I went to my brother Aleem and I requested him...
[13:32] I asked for Hadia's hand for Faizan and thank God that he said yes.
[13:53] You know brother Aleem's elder daughter Hadia, right?
[13:59] Yes...
[14:02] I know her. I've decided that...
[14:07] on the sacred day of Friday, we'll arrange a small gathering and on that day we'll decide the date of the wedding.
[14:18] My son's wedding will be arranged with all pageantry.
[14:24] Razi just left, he'll be taking care of all the arrangements. 
[14:29] Sister, you have to do all of the shopping with Shina and Farwa...
[14:36] you have to invite all of your friends and have a grand time. After all your brother is getting married.
[14:42] Sure, uncle.
[14:45] Thank God for this... go ahead and eat.
[15:08] Razi... listen to me.
[15:12] You were late.
What should I have done? Everything was in front of you...
[15:17] You shouldn't have wasted a day coming here. Look how I've endured a loss now.
[15:22] Yes, we've endured a loss, I do know that.
No...
[15:27] You don't know... if you had, then you wouldn't have wasted so much time being courteous.
[15:33] You shouldn't have waited to ask permission from uncle to go talk to uncle Aleem.
[15:39] Listen to me... I'll talk to Safdar.
What will you say to him?
[15:46] Will you ask him to take his son's proposal back, because you want to marry your son to Hadia?
[15:54] For God's sake mother...
[15:57] Leave me alone.
[16:00] I'm not in the position to speak right now, I just want to sleep.
[16:13] Farwa, you can leave as well...
[16:20] Please...
[16:33] How can she do this to me?
[16:37] She knew I loved her.
[16:42] I shared my feeling with her as well.
[16:46] Still, she left me and agreed to marry Faizan.
[16:53] She betrayed me.
[16:56] She wronged me.
[17:01] She made a fool out of my love and emotions.
[17:06] She wasn't right to do this.
Maybe, uncle, Aleem forced her...
[17:15] No, I know him, they are very respectful people.
[17:22] I'm sure that uncle Aleem will never force his daughter.
[17:35] Should I say something if you don't take it the wrong way?
[17:42] It's possible that she doesn't like you.
[17:55] She's never...
[17:58] been clear to me.
[18:02] She didn't stop me... she always answered me.
[18:07] She used to wait for my calls. Then what was all of that?
[18:20] I should tell uncle that I love Hadia and...
No brother...
[18:26] No...
[18:29] If you do this then everything will go bad.
[18:33] I don't have any other choice, what else should I do?
[18:40] I feel as though I'll die without her.
[19:06] Sister!
[19:09] What?
[19:11] What are you thinking about? Is everything alright? You look busy in thought.
It's nothing...
[19:19] Sure, I know that very well and I've been noticing it for the past few days...
[19:25] Ever since father mentioned brother Faizan's proposal to you...
[19:28] there has been a different smile on your face.
[19:32] What is the matter?
It's nothing like that, I'm always happy.
[19:39] That is true, you always stay happy and keep others happy as well...
[19:44] But since the past few days, there has been a completely different reason for your happiness.
[19:48] Will you tell me, or should I? Okay, let me tell you...
[19:56] It seems that brother Faizan is the reason behind this smile, right?
[20:02] Silence yourself Fizza! Don't you have studying to do today? Go and study.
[20:07] Sure, I'll do that. But tell me what you were thinking.
[20:13] Go away from here...
Alright, don't be shy, I'm leaving.
[20:57] We don't have much time, but I'll talk to Khadija.
[21:03] Farewell.
[21:07] I think he wants to get the engagement and the marriage over with as soon as possible.
[21:12] But, I've asked him for a month.
[21:17] Only a month?
[21:20] How will I prepare for everything in such a short amount of time?
[21:23] They said that they don't want anything, then what's the need in preparing anything?
[21:28] What should we do then? Send our daughter there empty-handed?
[21:33] Thank God we have everything.
[21:38] Then why do you want to embarrass us in front of everybody?
[21:41] Whatever is ours belongs to our daughter and I will give my daughter everything that we can offer.
[21:49] So that she may never be taunted by her in-laws.
[21:52] But Safdar has strictly refused a dowry.
[21:56] He even said that even if we send a needle, he'll send it back.
[22:01] Besides, he's taking Hadia as his daughter, not a daughter-in-law.
[22:07] I have full faith in brother Safdar...
[22:11] But forgive me, I don't have any expectations from my sister-in-law.
[22:15] You might have said, otherwise I wouldn't have agreed without verifying everything.
[22:24] You're repeating the same old things. Listen to me...
[22:28] If they have refused to take a dowry, then why should we hurt them?
[22:35] I will make him aware that all the property I have will be equally divided between both of my daughters.
[22:43] Alright?
Alright.
[22:46] Don't worry... and would you please get me a glass of cold water?
Sure
[23:10] Greetings.
[23:14] Father will be here in a while, you can call back later.
[23:18] Farewell.
[23:22] It seems that you're waiting for someone's call.
[23:28] No, it's nothing like that.
[23:34] Oh really... anyways...
[23:39] uh...
[23:43] He didn't call you once since yesterday, right?
[23:46] It might be that he's afraid of his father, or that he's busy.
[23:52] Yes, that's true. I think he truly loves you, that's why he send a proposal.
[24:01] Do you know...
[24:06] Ask me what...
Speak...
[24:09] Uncle Safdar and auntie are coming here to conduct the ritual.
[24:17] And you're telling me this now!
Better late than never.
[24:23] What will I wear?
We'll decide that soon, but do you know what the best part is...
[24:30] it's possible that he might come along as well.
Really... no way!
[24:37] We'll go early in the morning and go shopping.
Done!
[24:41] Faizan, you need to come with us, otherwise, you know your dad will get upset
I don't care.
[24:49] What do you mean you don't care? How will we conduct the engagement then? What will they think?
[24:54] I only agreed to marry her because of you, I have no interest in Hadia.
[25:00] It's for your betterment that you marry Hadia...
[25:05] Otherwise, your father would have taken away your inheritance. If I hadn't made this plan...
[25:11] then maybe you wouldn't have been in this home.
[25:15] Come with me.
[25:18] I don't want to go! You guys go ahead with the engagement. I'll come on the wedding day.
[25:33] I asked him... I pleaded but he was adamant that he won't go.
[25:41] Shina, Faizan has to put the ring on Hadia. 
[25:45] Besides, brother Aleem and sister want to meet him.
[25:53] It was hard for me to convince him, don't put to much pressure on him.
[25:58] What if he does something regrettable out of anger?
What will I say to them?
[26:06] You should have thought of that before.
[26:10] Alright...
[26:12] We'll make an excuse, I'll put the ring on Hadia, besides I think that...
[26:18] they won't like the girl and the boy sitting down and talking to each other before the wedding.
[26:24] Yes, you're right.
[26:30] But...
[26:32] still take care of it.
[26:46] Sister... hurry up, they'll be here any moment now.
I'm almost done.
[26:53] If you would have listened to me, we would have gotten ready at the salon.
[26:58] No need for us to get ready at a salon for a small ritual.
[27:01] You can do everything for the wedding.
That I'll do.
[27:07] I'll fulfill all my dreams... but for now, show me how you look.
[27:12] Why have you applied such less makeup? Let me do it for you.
[27:15] No... I've applied as much as I like it on me.
[27:18] It's your engagement and everyone will look at you.
[27:23] More than everyone it will be brother Faizan who will be looking at you.
[27:27] Fizza!
I'm here mother!
[27:39] You look so beautiful. May God save you from harm.
[27:45] Thank you mother for always praying for me.
[27:50] Mother, I'm your daughter as well. Why don't you bless me as much as you do sister?
[27:57] Why do you say such things?
[27:59]  I pray for both of my daughters, may God bless both of my daughters!
[28:04] Mother, forget about her, she's always teasing you. Did you have something for me?
[28:09] Your father was telling me that brother Safdar called to tell him that they have left. They'll be here any moment now.
[28:17] Oh really!
Come to the kitchen and help me out.
[28:23] I'll come as well.
[28:24] No need for that... you will not do anything today. Sit down.
[28:28] She'll do everything today.
That truly is amazing!
[28:50] Farwa, hurry up, we're running late.
[28:54] Where is she?
I'm here mother.
[28:57] We're running late.
[28:59] Come on...
Mother...
[29:04] I don't feel like going at all, you go ahead...
What are you saying?
[29:09] First, it was Razi who refused and now you're refusing to go. What will I say to Razi?
[29:16] Brother Razi is in pain, I can't see him like this.
Look...
[29:23] We're all forced to bear this pain. Hadia wasn't fated to be with Razi.
[29:29] We should accept that.
Sister are you ready, brother Aleem is waiting for us.
[29:36] Sure, Safdar, we are ready, let's go.
[29:38] Where's Razi, I can't see him anywhere.
He isn't well, I stopped him from going.
[29:45] What happened?
Nothing to worry about. He just has a fever...
[29:51] If need be, we'll take him to the doctor when we come back.
Sure, let's go.
[30:01] Yes brother Rizwan, such are the circumstances nowadays...
[30:08] You're right...
[30:11] Alright... God willing, we'll talk again soon...
[30:15] Farewell.
[30:18] Khadija!
[30:21] Khadija! Hurry up, they are here!
[30:26] Come on...
Should I bring sister?
[30:29] No, my dear, we'll bring her when everyone's seated.
I feel very excited...
[30:36] Come on...
[30:47] Is everything done?
Yes it is... is there anything else to do?
[30:51] No, everything is fine.
I've fried the samosas and served them on the plates.
[30:55] Check the tea and see if it tastes good.
[30:59] Mother... what is the matter?
[31:03] Is everything alright? Why the long face?
[31:09] I don't why, but I feel anxious.
[31:13] Mother, today is a day of happiness, then why are you worried?
[31:19] I don't know why, but it feels that something bad is about to happen with Hadia.
[31:26] God forbid, what are you saying? May God always keep sister happy, don't say that.
[31:33] God willing, everything goes well and God always keeps her happy.
[31:38] Yeah... but I don't know why brother Faizan didn't come with everybody.
[31:45] That's what worries... he should have come today...
[31:51] Yes... he should have. Don't worry... maybe he got busy with something else, and couldn't come.
[31:58] Besides, father is talking, we'll soon know why he didn't come.
[32:06] Go and sit with Hadia, send her when I call on your name.
[32:12] Alright... don't worry.
[33:13] Sister...
[33:17] Sister...
[33:20] What? You're always lost thinking about brother Faizan.
[33:27] Why are you here?
[33:29] Mother sent me to sit here with you. I have to take you when she calls for me.
[33:35] Is everyone here...
Not all of them, but there are a few people here.
[33:40] What do you mean?
Meaning, brother Faizan didn't come.
[33:43] What?
[33:45] Enough... don't overreact like mother. Maybe he was busy with some work.
[33:53] Why are you so sad?
Silence... and let's go.
[33:57] Not now, mother said that she'll call for us.
[34:00] Be patient.
[35:15] Wow... this has been wonderful...
[35:18] Brother Aleem, there was no need for you to go through this trouble.
[35:21] We're already very late and it takes about three hours for us to go back to Karachi.
[35:26] I offered Safdar to stay with her for the night and leave in the morning.
[35:33] That's not at all possible. Faizan is waiting for us there.
Sister...
[35:40] Why didn't you bring him along... that way we would have met our son-in-law.
[35:46] I wanted Faizan to come here and put the ring on Hadia but...
[35:51] I thought that maybe you wouldn't like it...
[35:58] We're not primitive people, besides Faizan is our son, and there are no formalities with him.
[36:05] When you guys visit us next week, you can meet your son-in-law.
[36:18] How does the 25th sound brother Aleem?
[36:22] So soon! How will we prepare for it?
[36:32] Why are you worrying?
[36:35] Everything will be alright. Send your daughter to us in a simple manner, we don't want a thing.
[36:42]  If you do want to give us something...
[36:45] then give us your prayers.
[36:49] I understand that, but how is that possible?
[36:52] We're taking away your most prized possession, your daughter. 
[36:56] Apart from her, we want nothing.
[36:59] She is enough for us.
[37:06] No Safdar, it isn't like that...
[37:10] Look, we only have two daughters and this is the first marriage of our house so...
[37:17] Khadija wants to fulfill some of her desires.
[37:22] Brother Aleem everything will be taken care of... this will be a grand wedding!
[37:28] If God is willing.
[37:42] Fizza, go and bring the desserts.
