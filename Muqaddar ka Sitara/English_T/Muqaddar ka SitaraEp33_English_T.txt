[01:14] Hey Faizan, why aren't you picking up phone?
[01:27] Greetings uncle Saleem
[01:29] how are you?
[01:30] Hey, Faizan wasn't ..
[01:32] picking up my call
[01:34] do you know where is he?
[01:40] With Hadia? To farm house? Where?
[01:59] Hello? Did you find out where he is?
[02:01] Yes I did. I talked to uncle Saleem
[02:06] He told me that he's with Hadia
[02:07] and has gone to farm house
[02:10] what?
[02:17] Faizan!
[02:44] Greetings sir!
[02:46] Greetings!
[03:55] Come in sir!
[04:01] Sir, you get fresh. I'll organize the table
[04:03] Okay!
[04:06] Wow! How beautiful is this place
[04:08] how beautiful is everything
[04:10] really amazing
[04:12] yes, its beautiful
[04:13] There is something over there too. There is a mini zoo
[04:15] There is also go karting
[04:17] A person gets tired, but farm house doesn't end
[04:20] father has made such good arrangements for us
[04:23] how much he care about us
[04:28] If I knew coming here would make you so happy
[04:30] I would have already arranged it
[04:32] No problem! I'm going to enjoy a lot even now
[04:38] lets go change
[04:40] I'm hungry. Lets have lunch
[05:21] what is it?
[05:23] you seem very angry
[05:24] Yes, I'm too angry
[05:27] I feel like burning the whole world
[05:30] what happened?
[05:32] what did Faizan do now?
[05:35] I know this well
[05:37] that only Faizan is the reason of your anger
[05:40] it isn't difficult for me to get it
[05:44] now tell me, what did he do?
[05:46] My doubt was right
[05:48] Faizan hasn't gone to Islamabad on business trip
[05:51] infact, he has gone to Muree with that Hadia
[05:54] so?
[05:55] what's to worry about it?
[05:59] how can he do this to me, mother?
[06:02] its been only 2 days that we are married
[06:05] my dear ..
[06:07] you chose this difficult path yourself
[06:10] I used to always tell you ..
[06:13] that Faizan isn't strong
[06:15] neither he is sensible nor loyal
[06:17] and he has no sense at all
[06:20] mother, what rubbish are you saying?
[06:23] my concern isn't this right now that either Faizan is a fool or sensible
[06:27] so?
[06:28] then why are you crying?
[06:30] Faizan will keep doing this
[06:33] now he's riding two boats
[06:36] and do remember one thing
[06:38] he will leave some one of you
[06:41] and ..
[06:42] I think it would be you
[06:44] Hadia's father in law would save her
[06:47] he is also my father in law
[06:49] how could he leave me?
[06:51] when he'd come to know that I'm his son's wife
[06:55] hey! hey!
[06:56] how innocent you are
[06:58] take this misconception out of your mind
[07:01] we can use these threats only on Faizan
[07:04] if by mistake
[07:06] Safdar Kamal would know about it ..
[07:09] then we'd have to suffer
[07:11] He will send us somewhere over the night
[07:13] and no police would be able to find us
[07:16] no one would know where we are
[07:19] then?
[07:20] then mother, you tell me? What do I do?
[07:23] I can't tolerate it at all
[07:25] that Faizan is with that Hadia
[07:27] and I'm alone here
[07:30] you'd have to tolerate
[07:33] Cool down
[07:36] or else it would back fire
[08:05] wow!
[08:07] so much?
[08:08] sir ordered us
[08:12] what is the menu of dinner?
[08:14] your reservation in hotel is already done
[08:17] Fine! You can go
[08:18] if you need anything, do let me know
[08:23] he is controlling us here as well
[08:26] what happened Faizan
[08:27] he would want to surprise us
[08:29] I am really liking everything
[08:31] you shouldn't think negative too
[08:45] who is calling?
[08:47] father!
[08:52] give it to me, I'll talk
[08:54] he would be asking, how is everything
[08:55] no, I'm doing it
[08:58] greetings father
[09:00] who is with you?
[09:01] in front of whom it is difficult to talk to me
[09:04] Everything is really good, father
[09:07] are you in some meeting?
[09:08] yes!
[09:09] then talk normally without taking my name
[09:12] no one will ask
[09:14] also, a wife can call anytime
[09:18] yes, but we are having lunch right now
[09:22] I'll talk to you later
[09:28] Hadia is very happy
[09:29] thank you so much!
[09:35] Okay! bye!
[09:39] hello?
[09:40] hello?
[10:11] Hey, father is calling me now
[10:14] there is no need to talk
[10:17] what happened? he won't like it
[10:19] I'll talk
[10:21] He won't. I have just talked. Why is he calling again? 
[10:24] we are on honeymoon. He should leave us alone
[10:27] I'm putting your phone on airplane mode
[10:30] so that no one disturb us
[10:32] I'll put mine too
[10:36] I'm very hungry. Can I please have food now?
[10:52] her phone is switched off
[10:55] whose?
[10:56] Natasha's
[11:00] I ..
[11:01] I'm scared, what if she'd leave the country
[11:03] she can't go anywhere. I have her passport
[11:07] what if she goes to U.S embassay and complain about you?
[11:11] don't you worry. I'll look after this
[11:15] She's doing everything because of that clever person
[11:19] otherwise, I know that she isn't that sensible
[11:30] you check this
[11:31] she made such a big mistake
[11:35] she won't do this all if she had sense
[11:37] she wants me to give her property worth millions so that her husband would take it and run away?
[11:45] huh
[11:45] and then she comes back to us? She won't go out
[11:49] he would go
[11:51] and as far as ..
[11:52] complaint is concerned
[11:54] she can complaint anywhere
[11:56] I don't care
[11:58] you still care about your millions?
[12:01] you don't think at all in what condition your daughter is?
[12:06] I haven't contacted her since 2 days
[12:09] for you, your ego might be valuable but for me 
[12:12] there is nothing more important than my children
[12:17] if I have to give away this whole wealth
[12:20] to get my daughter back? I will definitely go for it
[12:29] if you won't support me
[12:32] then fine
[12:32] I will still fight. But I won't leave my daughter alone in this pain
[13:09] Hadia, are you ready?
[13:11] 2 minutes
[13:13] be quick
[13:55] you look very beautiful
[14:03] infact ..
[14:05] you are
[14:07] very beautiful
[14:09] you always do look
[14:12] shall we go?
[14:22] I don't feel like going
[14:40] such a bad person is calling right now
[14:43] I just ..
[14:47] who is that bad person?
[14:50] father asked for some work
[14:52] that person is calling. I have to cordinate something
[14:54] you go sit in the car, I'm coming
[14:56] Okay! Come soon
[14:58] hmm
[15:06] here!
[15:17] how many times have I told you not to call me here. I'm here for work
[15:20] I'll call when I'd be free
[16:17] what if I have made a mistake?
[16:22] but I had no option but this
[16:27] I do .. I do love Ramsha
[16:39] and Hadia ..
[16:42] I don't want to betray her
[16:46] how innocent is she
[16:48] and how much she loves me
[17:00] she'd be too hurt if she'd find out that I'm betraying her
[17:09] and Ramsha would kill me if I'd ignore her. I don't know what will she do if she'd find out that I'm with Hadia
[17:24] she also loves me a lot
[18:17] I wish
[18:18] father hadn't forced me. Then I wasn't stuck between two girls like this
[18:43] you don't think at all in what condition your daughter is?
[18:48] I couldn't contact her since past 2 days
[19:01] for you, your ego might be valuable but for me there is nothing more important than my children
[19:47] You?
[19:52] won't you ask me to come in?
[20:07] did father send you?
[20:13] I want to talk something important
[20:17] come in
[20:17] lets go and talk
[20:18] I don't want to talk to anyone
[20:46] come in my child
[20:48] Khadija?
[20:50] Khadija?
[20:54] Greetings mother!
[20:55] Greetings!
[20:57] my daughter is here. Its good that you are here
[21:01] House was empty without you
[21:03] yes!
[21:03] I got leaves for few days so I thought to go to my parents quickly
[21:07] this is why I came rushing here
[21:08] you did good, my child
[21:10] since the day, Faizan and Hadia are gone to Muree
[21:14] your mother
[21:16] is missing them both a lot
[21:19] now that you are here
[21:20] she'd be happy too
[21:23] sister is very lucky
[21:25] sometimes, she is in Islamabad. Sometimes, Muree. Sometimes, somewhere else
[21:29] they are beautiful places
[21:31] I really wish to go. I have never gone
[21:34] no problem
[21:35] when you'll get married
[21:36] then go with your husband
[21:38] no, I don't want to get married
[21:41] hey, can you hear her?
[21:43] one has to get married
[21:46] also ..
[21:47] I'm just worried about you
[21:51] why do you worry, Khadija?
[21:54] we are done with the responsibility of our elder daughter
[21:57] we'll fulfill the younger one's too soon. God will help us
[22:02] come on, wash your face
[22:03] put your luggage inside. I'll make breakfast for you
[22:06] yes mother!
[22:07] go!
[22:11] I had been trying your number since long
[22:14] why wasn't it responding?
[22:17] my phone was stolen
[22:18] at home ..
[22:19] why didn't you try to contact anyone at home?
[22:23] do you know how much auntie is worried for you?
[22:27] look
[22:28] whatever happened has happened
[22:30] I'm here to take you. Come! Uncle is too worried about you. Come
[22:33] who are you to order me?
[22:36] who am I?
[22:38] think that I sympathize to you
[22:40] I'm trying to take you out of this trap
[22:44] come with me
[22:48] Natasha? Natasha?
[22:50] I do agree that you got married
[22:52] you took the right decision
[22:54] but the guy you got married to is wrong
[22:56] he isn't right. You don't deserve him
[22:59] and this is why uncle is worried about you
[23:01] how ever Sherry is, he is my husband
[23:04] I know it well how good or bad he is
[23:08] father can be worried about me
[23:10] but why are you here?
[23:12] and you talking against my husband
[23:13] Natasha ..
[23:15] I won't just speak
[23:17] I will prove it to you as well
[23:20] you don't deserve that guy
[23:22] he's greedy
[23:24] do you know why he got married to you?
[23:25] because he knows that you are daughter of Safdar Kamal
[23:29] he doesn't love you
[23:31] he loves your status
[23:34] come with me
[23:36] who is he?
[23:38] he's Raazi. My cousin
[23:40] the one I was getting married to
[23:43] what is he here for?
[23:45] I'm here to take her
[23:47] she's my wife
[23:49] she might be
[23:51] but you don't deserve this
[23:55] do you know
[23:57] she might not know about you but I know you
[24:01] you are a greedy person and a hypocrite
[24:04] you got married to her only for money
[24:06] shut up!
[24:09] or else I'll break your teeth
[24:12] what do you think?
[24:14] you'd scream at me and I'd be quiet?
[24:18] remember this, Sherry
[24:20] I will come back
[24:23] I will take Natasha with me. Remember that
[24:25] Go away! I saw many like you
[24:27] I am not scare of your threats
[24:35] and you ..
[24:37] if I'd see your cousin here next time
[24:40] I'd break his legs
[24:45] what happened?
[24:46] you are upset because I insulted that cousin of yours?
[25:04] Raazi?
[25:05] what was the need of going there?
[25:07] are you in your senses?
[25:09] I can't tolerate uncle's sadness
[25:13] he looks fine but he is too worried about Natasha
[25:17] huh
[25:17] when they'll raise their children like this ..
[25:20] then they'd have to face this day
[25:22] mother?
[25:24] this isn't uncle's fault
[25:25] its his fault
[25:27] father doesn't have this responsibility only
[25:29] that he fulfills his children wishes
[25:32] and put all other responsibilities on mother
[25:35] and mother ..
[25:36] that too like Sheena
[25:37] couldn't Safdar see?
[25:40] these children aren't spoiled just now
[25:42] they are spoiled since childhood
[25:44] mother, why are you talking about past? Someone would hear it
[25:48] it wasn't your responsibility
[25:49] it was Faizan's responsibility. He should have gone
[25:51] Are you saying this?
[25:53] mother you used to say this that I'm like his son
[25:57] and you have not raised me this way that I won't help my uncle who is like my father when he is worried
[26:03] seriously?
[26:06] Natasha ..
[26:08] has always insulted you
[26:11] how ever she is
[26:12] I don't care
[26:16] mother?
[26:20] being a dignified man ..
[26:22] I would never want my uncle's children worried
[26:27] and I won't help them?
[26:34] mother?
[27:27] Natasha?
[27:31] for how long will you be upset?
[27:34] can you make me a cup of tea?
[27:36] I'm having headache
[27:42] look I know that you are worried
[27:46] didn't you see
[27:47] what was he saying about me?
[27:50] he was blaming me wrongly
[27:53] if he wasn't your cousin
[27:55] he had no idea what I could do to him
[27:57] Sherry, you have taken revenge of your insult
[27:59] there is no need to do anything
[28:03] you ..
[28:05] look
[28:06] in front of him
[28:08] you were calling me your husband again and again ..
[28:12] and now when I held his collar, it is making you upset?
[28:17] thankfully he wasn't angry
[28:20] he would have beaten you up if was angry too
[28:23] I'm enough to talk to him, so please
[28:27] Okay!
[28:28] I'm really sorry
[28:29] look
[28:30] I have right on you
[28:33] I can't tolerate anyone to look at you
[28:36] Just now you were saying that you got angry because he blamed you?
[28:41] I was angry at that too
[28:43] but you tell me?
[28:45] if someone would blame a decent man so wrongly, won't he get upset?
[28:49] but ..
[28:50] why was he blaming you? There would be something
[28:54] Natasha, you are getting manipulated by him for no reason
[28:56] he wanted to take you along. He needed a reason for that
[29:03] Natasha, I'm warning you
[29:05] if your cousin would come here again
[29:07] I will report a case against him
[29:09] that he kidnapped my wife
[29:11] but next time if you'd raise your hand on him or do anything
[29:15] then I'd go with him myself
[29:17] are you getting it, Sherry?
[29:35] he did one right thing
[29:42] mother, brother Raazi shouldn't have gone there
[29:45] what if something would have happened to him?
[29:47] I was worried about it too
[29:50] what if something would have happened to my son?
[29:53] I would have died
[29:55] we are well aware of auntie's and Natasha's nature
[29:59] they don't see anyone's sacrifice
[30:02] also ..
[30:03] we have no relation with Natasha now
[30:06] still brother took risk for her
[30:10] my child ..
[30:12] he is doing this all because of his uncle
[30:15] he doesn't want Safdar to face any trouble
[30:20] also ...
[30:22] somewhere ..
[30:23] he sympathizes with Natasha too
[30:26] You know it very well what feelings do Natasha have in her heart for us. How much she hates us
[30:31] especially with brother
[30:32] yes my child ..
[30:34] no matter what she thinks about us
[30:37] but I haven't raised you this way
[30:40] that you'd see someone in worry
[30:42] and leave him alone
[30:46] right now, Safdar ..
[30:47] need us
[30:50] we should help him
[30:53] He's worried about Natasha
[30:57] no matter ..
[30:58] he doesn't say anything by mouth
[31:00] but he is suffering inside
[31:04] hmm
[31:06] fine!
[31:08] we'll do what you'd say
[31:12] but I'm worried about brother Raazi
[31:15] I have seen him broken once
[31:18] because of sister Hadia
[31:20] it was hard for him to take control of himself
[31:23] but now 
[31:24] if something happens, I won't be able to tolerate
[31:29] May God have mercy
[31:36] so
[31:37] tell me this first, how is your trip going?
[31:40] haven't you forgotten us?
[31:41] its amazing
[31:43] its such a beautiful and big farm house
[31:46] I'm enjoying a lot. Weather is too good too
[31:49] I don't feel like coming back
[31:51] wow! That's great
[31:53] Tell me, how's brother Faizan
[31:55] isn't he in bad mood?
[31:57] is he scolding you again?
[31:58] o no! He's really nice. He takes such good care of me
[32:02] I'm enjoying here because of him
[32:04] otherwise no matter how good a farm house is
[32:06] if Faizan wasn't treating me well
[32:09] then I wasn't enjoying
[32:10] Wow! Wonderful
[32:13] now don't talk much
[32:16] we'll go for dinner tonight
[32:18] I'll send you pictures. Do show those to mother
[32:21] Sure! Do take care of yourself. Bye!
[32:25] bye! Take care

[32:54] at least they left something
[32:56] I thought thief took that too
[32:58] by the way
[32:59] you should fulfill all my needs
[33:01] but then I think ..
[33:04] its useless to keep a hope, right?
[33:06] look Natasha?
