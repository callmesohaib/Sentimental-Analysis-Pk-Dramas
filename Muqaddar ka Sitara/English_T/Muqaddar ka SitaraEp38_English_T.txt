[01:00] My child, take care of yourself
[01:03] We'll leave now
[01:03] Mother, don't go. I just came
[01:06] God knows when will we meet then?
[01:08] And you people hadn't have dinner yet
[01:11] my child ..
[01:12] Permit us to leave today
[01:14] We'll have dinner some other day
[01:17] Look, we have to go to Fizza's hostel as well 
[01:20] we have to meet her too and then ..
[01:22] we have to reach home before midnight
[01:25] later ..
[01:26] Fine, I'll wait for you both
[01:29] listen?
[01:31] Take good care of yourself, eh?
[01:33] understood? Shall we go?
[01:36] Okay my child
[01:37] lets go!
[01:38] Bye!
[01:56] Sheena, your attitude today
[01:58] with sister and brother
[02:00] was really inappropriate
[02:03] taunting has become your habit
[02:05] and today?
[02:06] you have crossed all the limits
[02:09] such bad manners?
[02:11] such attitude
[02:14] they didn't stop even after hearing the good news
[02:16] you should have stopped them at least for dinner
[02:18] I did
[02:20] You wanted me to fold my hands in front of them?
[02:23] O God!
[02:25] Brother Aleem is my very old and close friend
[02:28] and now this friendship has converted into a relationship
[02:30] whenever he comes here
[02:32] he should get a protocol. I'm telling you
[02:35] They should also stay in their limit
[02:37] Ask them to stay in contact only with their daughter
[02:40] They better don't interfere in our personal matters
[02:44] They were just asking about Natasha ..
[02:46] Enough of supporting them
[02:48] I know such people very well
[02:51] when they get a chance
[02:53] to find our weakness
[02:55] they start taunting
[02:57] they aren't such people
[02:58] why do you always think negative about them?
[03:01] your opinion about ..
[03:02] Hadia wasn't right as well
[03:04] but see
[03:05] how much lucky is she proven for our house
[03:09] Becoming a mother isn't a big deal?
[03:11] Many women in the world are going through this phase
[03:14] as if she has done a big thing
[03:17] Sheena
[03:18] I'm not just talking about that
[03:21] You see how much Faizan has changed after wedding
[03:25] he's acting mature
[03:27] he's focusing on his studies as well
[03:29] and is also taking interest in business
[03:32] People do get sense of responsibility and become mature after wedding
[03:37] if you ..
[03:39] want to give credit to Hadia for this all
[03:41] then fine, I don't care
[03:43] Enough of this Sheena
[03:47] Fix your mood
[03:49] Hadia ..
[03:50] is daughter in law of this house
[03:52] she's our daughter
[03:54] and it is your responsibility to take care of her health, food and everything
[04:01] Look, you ask a maid to always take care of her
[04:06] Also, I forgot one thing
[04:08] Send baskets of sweets to brother Aleem's house as well
[04:12] what is the need to send it now?
[04:15] When the time would come
[04:17] when Faizan would have a child
[04:19] then I will distribute sweet among the whole family with my own hands
[04:23] not just family, distribute it in the whole city. I have no objection
[04:27] but for now, do what I'm asking you
[04:30] Ask Raazi for some baskets of sweet
[04:33] and ask him to give it to brother Aleem's house
[05:13] Aren't you happy of becoming a mother?
[05:19] why would you?
[05:22] If Raazi was at my place
[05:24] you might be happy then?
[05:27] what do you want?
[05:29] why do you insult me again and again?
[05:31] Be thankful that I'm silent
[05:36] I haven't told anything to anyone. The day they'll find it out, you have no idea what chaos will it cause?
[05:41] he chaos has already happened
[05:43] what is left more?
[05:44] you doubted on me
[05:46] and have shown how small your heart is
[05:50] Hadia, I'm only silent because of this child
[05:54] otherwise?
[05:56] whatever has happened?
[05:58] Hadia, if someone else was there he would have done God knows what
[06:04] but why are you quiet?
[06:08] if you doubt me this much then leave me
[06:11] go and tell everyone
[06:14] am I mad?
[06:18] I'll leave you so that you can go to Raazi?
[06:20] this is what he wants
[06:20] enough!
[06:22] enough of this Faizan
[06:23] I have heard you enough
[06:25] now you'd listen to me
[06:48] mother, can I say something?
[06:50] yes?
[06:53] I don't feel that sister Hadia 
[06:55] is very happy
[06:58] what do you mean?
[06:59] I mean ..
[07:01] I feel that something happened between sister Hadia and brother Faizan in Islamabad
[07:05] why do you think this way?
[07:07] I don't feel any such thing
[07:09] Faizan is very happy with her
[07:11] She gave him such a big news
[07:14] yes, brother Faizan was happy but sister Hadia looked very dull
[07:19] she might be tired because of travel
[07:21] She'll be fine after rest. Didn't you see how happy she was after meeting her parents?
[07:26] yes
[07:28] It might be a misconception
[07:31] but I felt so
[07:33] otherwise, I have never seen sister Hadia this sad ever
[07:37] leave this 
[07:39] you go and check food in kitchen
[07:42] Raazi is about to come
[07:45] Tell me, why didn't brother Raazi come back with them?
[07:48] I don't know. I'll ask when he'd be here
[08:05] The relation I and Raazi had
[08:09] it was in past
[08:11] that was only limited to phone
[08:17] I started liking Raazi considering him Faizan
[08:23] I didn't know that you were Faizan
[08:28] It was a misunderstanding
[08:34] When uncle Safdar came to our house for the first time
[08:40] Fizza told me that he's Faizan
[08:42] his son
[08:50] On first sight ..
[08:52] he liked me
[08:59] We didn't even meet after that
[09:02] We only talked on phone
[09:08] When Raazi confessed his liking to me
[09:13] Next day, uncle Safdar came with the proposal
[09:19] The Faizan he brought the proposal for ..
[09:22] was actually Raazi
[09:25] I came to know about this during henna night that he is someone else and you are uncle Safdar's son Faizan
[10:12] Shall I call father and tell him your love story?
[10:17] Shall I tell him how his dear nephew meet his daughter in law and my wife secretly?
[10:31] You had always taken my place but now I will humiliate you in front of father so much that he won't see your face
[10:59] Is this why you were very formal with me?
[11:02] There was someone else in your heart and mind
[11:05] only in the beginning
[11:07] that was also because you didn't love me
[11:10] you weren't giving me attention
[11:12] you were insulting me again and again
[11:16] you didn't like my existence
[11:19] I tried hard to get closer to you 
[11:23] but there was someone else in your heart
[11:25] you kept cheating on me because of that Ramsha and now you are blaming me for betrayal?
[11:29] I am a man. I can do anything
[11:31] Don't compare yourself with me
[11:34] wow!
[11:38] how is this fair?
[11:41] Because you are a man, all your sins are forgiven?
[11:44] because I'm a woman, no one should even believe my innocence?
[11:49] you aren't that innocent, Hadia
[11:52] you got married to me but loved someone else
[11:55] it wasn't love
[11:57] it was a misunderstanding
[11:59] I only loved one person and that is you
[12:03] I can swear upon our unborn child
[12:06] I took Raazi out of my heart after our wedding
[12:10] and trust me ..
[12:11] besides living in the same house
[12:13] Raazi never tried to come closer to me or talk to me. That day, suddenly ..
[12:17] Enough!
[12:19] Enough!
[12:21] do you think that I would believe your false explanations?
[12:28] enough!
[12:31] don't lie further
[12:36] I will keep a firm eye on you both
[12:40] what you do or say or where you go ..
[12:43] it will be according to me
[12:46] your life is under my control
[12:50] and if I have heard anything wrong
[12:53] I will tell everything to father
[14:14] Yes mother?
[14:15] Where are you Raazi?
[14:17] You aren't here. Its too late
[14:19] You are back from Islamabad
[14:21] Yes mother, I have
[14:24] I was out for some work
[14:27] I'll be late 
[14:29] don't you worry
[14:31] why won't I be?
[14:33] your uncle has asked many times
[14:36] why aren't you picking up his call?
[14:42] answer me
[14:45] hello?
[14:47] hello?
[14:52] huh?
[14:54] he disconnected the call
[14:59] this guy ..
[15:27] Faizan my child, are you going somewhere?
[15:30] yes!
[15:31] Did Hadia have her dinner?
[15:33] I don't know
[15:35] My child, take good care of her
[15:37] she is becoming mother of your child
[15:39] I know
[15:41] do you want to say something else or shall I go?
[15:44] umm
[15:44] I was just ..
[15:46] try to explain it to you
[15:50] did you not like it?
[15:52] auntie, give these advice to your dear son
[15:55] not me
[15:56] my parents are alive to advice me
[16:00] and I think I'm mature enough. I don't need advice
[16:03] so please, be careful next time
[16:05] what if I misbehave. Then you'd complaint to your dear brother
[16:09] and environment of house will be ruined
[16:11] what happened to you Faizan
[16:13] why would I complain?
[16:18] Auntie, you and your son can do anything
[16:21] I know this
[16:22] Did you have a fight with Raazi?
[16:24] did he say something?
[16:37] mother?
[16:39] He's ill-mannered. He'd always be
[16:41] how many times have I told you not to talk to them
[16:44] why do you talk to him?
[16:47] he ..
[16:48] did he have a fight with Raazi?
[16:51] what happened?
[16:53] nothing!
[16:55] He is habitual of blaming brother
[16:59] leave it
[17:00] lets go
[17:45] people with similar thinking
[17:52] are not in our fate
[17:58] I wish
[18:00] I wish I had sent proposal to you before Faizan
[18:04] then today ..
[18:09] you were mine instead of Faizan
[18:16] I have lost a diamond like you
[18:52] Stop! Where are you going in rush?
[18:55] Are you taking it for Faizan?
[18:57] yes!
[18:58] what happened to him?
[19:00] I don't know. He isn't telling anything
[19:02] He looks sad and lost
[19:05] shall I ask him?
[19:06] No, you don't go
[19:07] he's very angry right now
[19:10] angry?
[19:12] what if Hadia has found out about you both?
[19:15] I don't know. May be ..
[19:17] but I will find it out
[19:19] He will stay here tonight
[19:21] its good
[19:23] Go and take care of him
[19:25] its a good chance
[19:26] okay? Go!
[19:57] Faizan, what has happened to you?
[20:00] At least, tell me?
[20:02] you are very upset
[20:03] I can't see you like this
[20:07] how many times will you ask?
[20:10] nothing happened
[20:13] I will keep asking until you tell me the truth
[20:17] you are really upset
[20:19] And I care about you a lot. I can't see you like this
[20:23] and may be I can help you
[20:25] Ramsha, I'm telling you. Nothing happened
[20:27] leave me
[21:48] you?
[21:50] you are calling at this time? Is everything okay?
[21:52] umm
[21:53] its midnight
[21:54] Faizan hasn't come back
[21:57] I know where would he be right now
[21:59] don't you worry
[22:03] you mean?
[22:05] with Ramsha?
[22:07] yes
[22:09] he won't go anywhere else than her
[22:11] anyways, don't you worry
[22:13] I will find out
[22:15] no! you ..
[22:16] you don't call
[22:18] I don't know why I called you
[22:20] he will come back
[22:24] God knows what will happen if Faizan has a doubt that I called you
[22:29] you don't need to be worried
[22:31] you didn't do anything
[22:34] look
[22:37] you don't need to be scared of anyone
[22:40] I here
[22:42] okay?
[22:44] Bye!
[23:26] If I wasn't in love with Hadia
[23:29] then I wasn't worried
[23:31] I would have let her go
[23:36] now she isn't only my wife
[23:38] she'd be a mother soon
[23:40] its impossible to leave her
[23:48] I can't tolerate it
[23:51] What if Hadia is telling the truth
[23:54] She might have a relationship with Raazi in past
[23:59] whatever it is
[26:28] you?
[26:29] what are you doing here?
[26:31] umm
[26:33] umm
[26:34] Farwa ..
[26:35] I was finding Farwa ..
[26:37] where is she?
[26:40] Farwa's room
[26:42] is there
[26:44] this is my room
[26:46] oh

[30:00] you didn't tell me why were you so upset?
[30:03] but I got it
[30:12] you had a fight with your wife?
[30:16] she might have found out
[30:18] that I also came to farmhouse with Zohain the other day
[30:24] hello?
[30:25] Faizan?
[30:26] Why aren't you answering?

[32:31] I and Farwa slept waiting for you
[32:34] tell me this, why did you go straight to office after coming back from Islamabad?
[32:37] why didn't you come back home?
[32:39] mother ..
[32:43] I had to attend an important meeting
[32:46] this is why I couldn't come directly home
[32:49] okay!
[32:51] listen?
[32:53] did you have a fight with Faizan?
[32:57] no!
[32:59] what happened? Did something happen?
[33:01] see
[33:02] I was telling you this
[33:04] that if something had happened
[33:07] then brother Raazi had told you the truth before anyone
[33:11] but ..
[33:12] his mood wasn't fine
[33:14] he was upset
[33:16] mother ..
[33:17] he is always like this
[33:19] anyways ..
[33:21] leave him
[33:22] I don't care
[33:23] but he should change his habit now
[33:26] he's going to be a father
[33:32] brother, shall I serve you breakfast?
[33:36] no!
[33:39] I am going for walk. I'm not hungry
[33:48] Come mother!
[34:11] Be quiet!
[34:12] Get lost!
[34:43] I won't let Sherry get on my nerves
[35:33] Raazi?
[35:38] you are awake this early? Is everything alright?
[35:41] yes ..
[35:42] I woke up
[35:44] are you going outside?
[35:49] umm .. I
[35:51] just asked
[35:55] Is everything okay, Natasha?
[35:58] umm .. yes
[36:01] Even if it isn't
[36:04] I want it to be alright
[36:08] these days
[36:09] I have weird dreams
[36:13] I can't sleep properly
[36:16] anyways, everything will be fine
[36:19] don't you worry
[36:20] I'm going for walk
[36:22] you can ..
[36:23] join if you want to
[36:27] umm

[36:31] yeah!
[36:34] okay then
[36:35] wait
[36:36] I'll go and change
[36:38] wait for me
[36:39] I'm waiting outside
[37:33] what happened mother?
[37:41] mother?
[37:42] yes?
[37:44] what happened?
[37:46] no, nothing
[37:48] I am worried
[37:50] I just saw Natasha with Raazi
[37:55] its okay. They might have left for some work
[37:58] but I'm scared
[38:00] and I find it weird too
[38:03] what if Natasha ..
[38:04] has started taking interest in Raazi?
[38:10] Natasha has changed
[38:15] I have been noticing too
[38:17] I mean
[38:19] she has started talking nicely
[38:22] her behavior has changed a lot
[38:24] she talks really nicely especially with brother Raazi
[38:27] Raazi too ..
[38:29] no mother, brother Raazi 
[38:31] you know brother Raazi
[38:34] he ..
[38:34] he won't take interest in girl like Natasha
[38:37] also ..
[38:39] Brother Raazi refused earlier for the proposal
[38:41] yes, but Natasha refused too
[38:44] She rejected my son earlier
[38:47] and now see
[38:48] she is after him
[38:51] this is good ..
[38:53] what does she think of my son?
[38:56] first, reject him
[38:57] then ..
[38:59] come after him
[39:01] mother, its a matter of time
[39:03] situation has changed now
[39:06] Natasha might have realized her mistake now
[39:09] this is why she's changing. 
[39:11] and taking interest in brother Raazi
[39:13] no!
[39:15] I won't let it happen
[39:17] I would never accept Natasha as my daughter in law
[39:21] I accepted her earlier because of my brother
[39:25] but now ..
[39:26] there is no question
[39:30] I ..
[39:32] want a daughter in law like Hadia
[39:35] pious
[39:36] and obedient
[39:49] Leave it. Don't take tension. Have tea. It will be cold
[39:53] I'll give it to you
[39:56] have it
