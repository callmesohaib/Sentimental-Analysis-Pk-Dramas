[01:15] Razi...
[01:20] My dear, why are you sitting here like this? Did you eat?
[01:28] Have you put Faizan's ring on her?
[01:34] Forget her.
[01:37] He just went out with his wayward friends. He won't be back till morning.
[01:45] Mother, he has no interest in the fact that he was getting engaged today.
[01:50] I told you, enough. Forget her.
He's not worthy of her, mother!
[01:59] It's all just an act. He's not even worthy of the dust beneath her feet.
[02:02] Hadia is not the last girl on this earth.
For me, she is.
[02:09] I have never felt like this for anyone in my life.
[02:13] Why did you do this to me?
[02:16]  If she wasn't supposed to mine, then why did we meet?
[02:19] why that worthless guy is getting her?
[02:25] To this day, I've never asked God for anything.
[02:33] This was the first time I took a liking to a girl.
[02:39] And...
[02:43] God took her away from me.
Be patient.
[02:47] Be patient.
[02:50] Be strong and control yourself.
How can I do that?
[02:57] The fire burning inside me is provoking me to ruin everything.
[03:05] Razi...
[03:07] What are you doing? Control yourself.
[03:11] Bury all of your desires and your love.
[03:15] After two weeks she's getting married.
After getting married she'll come to this house.
[03:21] How can I see her with someone else?
[03:24] No... I can't stay here.
Have you gone insane?
[03:28] Where will you go?
Anywhere but not here.
[03:34] I used to think that my son was patient and brave.
[03:38] Why don't you understand that I love her!
[03:45] I can't see her being with someone else.
[03:49] Look at me...
[03:55] You're my entire life's work...
[03:59] You're my entire world.
[04:02] Your mother can't see you like this.
Alright...
[04:09] If you're worried about me... then you will not attend the wedding.
What can I do son?
[04:17] What can I do? There will be a wedding soon...
[04:22] It's not good to leave under such circumstances.
[04:26] Look... everyone is preparing for the wedding.
[04:31] Listen to me, after the wedding is done, we'll leave.
[04:37] I promise...
[04:40] just wait until the wedding. Then we'll leave.
[04:45] I can't tolerate this...
For God's sake Razi...
[04:52] For God's sake, open your heart.
[04:57] Listen to me. You have to attend the wedding.
[05:03] And you have to help your uncle prepare for the wedding.
[05:08] Do you understand me? My son has a great character...
[05:16] Don't despair my son.
[05:22] Enough...
[05:24] My dear son.
[05:36] Enough my dear.
[05:49] Why haven't you slept yet?
[05:53] It seems that brother Faizan's memory isn't letting you sleep.
[05:57] Don't say anything right now.
Sure, you won't like me speaking now.
[06:02] Now you'll like what brother Faizan will say.
Tell me something.
[06:08] Before the engagement, brother Faizan used to come here and we used to talk on the phone as well.
[06:14] Ever since our relationship has been fixed, he didn't call, nor did he come today.
[06:20] Aunt Shina was telling me that he's very shy.
[06:23] He was anxious to meet you, that's why he didn't come.
[06:27] He came here before, and back then he met me.
[06:31] He wasn't shy at all.
[06:33] It was different before. You two will be getting married soon.
[06:41] At least he could have called and congratulated me.
[06:44] Yes... why don't you call him?
[06:50] No, I won't.
[06:52] You're upset at him and the marriage hasn't even started yet.
[06:57] If he doesn't care about my feelings, then why should I call?
[07:01] Hey!
[07:05] Alright, I'm going to sleep. You can keep thinking about brother Faizan.
[07:18] It was hard for me to stop Razi, otherwise, he was going to leave home.
[07:24] He was right. We should leave.
[07:31] If we go like this, then everyone will suspect.
[07:37] You're still not worried about brother, you're worried about uncle and his family.
[07:42] What kind of mother wouldn't care about his son?
 I know my son's pain very well.
[07:51] But we can't do anything... did you not feel it?
[07:55] It's not just Safdar's family, brother Aleem's family was very happy as well.
[08:03] And Hadia...
[08:05] she was happy as well. Rather, she was very happy.
[08:10] I don't know why brother is going mad at her.
[08:16] I think Hadia never loved brother.
[08:20] She was fooling him and brother isn't understanding that.
[08:29] You can wear this at the dholki.
Sure, after all, it is a house event.
[08:37] Hello!
[08:40] Wow... what the hell?
[08:43] They are just clothes. What will you wear at the Mehndi?
[08:48] I told you I have no interest in this, then why are you asking me this question?
[08:54] Faizan, your father is trying to arrange a grand wedding for you.
[08:59] He wants to arrange a mehndi, barat, and dholki.
[09:03] Rubbish!
[09:06] Faizan, since you've agreed, you'll have to attend all functions.
[09:12] You've trapped me.
[09:14] Please! I don't have the strength to explain this to you again and again.
[09:18] I'm not refusing... I'm just saying...
[09:22] I have no interest in all this. I'm marrying her aren't I? Don't expect anything else from me.
[09:28] If your father finds out about what you've been doing at the night, then all of us will have to pay for it.
[09:34] Please don't make life difficult for us.
That won't happen. Do you know why?
[09:39] Because he's drowning in my favors to him. 
[09:42] It was his dream to have Hadia as his daughter-in-law and I'm making that dream come true.
[09:51] Once the wedding is done, just see what I'll do.
[09:55] If he wants to see Hadia happy, he'll have to transfer all his property to me.
[10:01] Excuse me... not all, only half.
[10:05] Whatever.
[10:37] Look what I have for you brother... your favorite biryani...
[10:41] I'm not hungry Farwa, take it back.
[10:46] You haven't eaten a thing since last night. If you keep this up, you'll get sick.
That's good
[10:53] Let me get sick.
[10:55] At least this way, I'll lose my life.
God forbid! What are you saying?
[11:01] Please don't say anything like that again.
[11:09] All of my happiness has been ruined Farwa...
[11:17] I don't want to live.
[11:19] I couldn't believe that this was how you'd react after a girl betrayed you.
[11:24] She's not disloyal...
[11:28] She's not.
Really...
[11:32] She's not disloyal...
[11:37] If she wasn't disloyal, then she wouldn't be happy at the wedding.
[11:44] If she had loved you, she would have refused brother Faizan's proposal.
[11:49] But no... she didn't do that.
[11:54] She put on brother Faizan's ring happily.
[12:04] No Farwa.
[12:07] She wasn't like this...
[12:10] I think that someone forced her.
[12:15] For God's sake brother...
[12:21] Face the truth...
[12:24] She did betray you... she is disloyal!
[12:35] Now hurry up and eat
[12:41] No.
[12:43] Leave me alone.
[12:46] At least a little bit.
Farwa, please...
[13:15] I told you that apart from brother Safdar, no one is happy with the wedding.
[13:21] Did you see how heartless sister Shina was?
 There was no happiness on her face.
[13:28] And her daughter...
[13:34] Looking at brother Safdar could anyone guess that he was a rich man conducting a simple engagement for his son?
[13:41] There were only four people and Faizan didn't come as well. 
[13:44] I'm telling you that something is wrong.
[13:47] Try and find out...
I think that...
[13:50] all these thoughts in your head have no base to them.
[13:55] Sister Shina has always been like that. Everyone knows.
[14:00] Her daughter is just like her. Just like how your daughter is just like you.
[14:09] Simple and respectful.
We had to insist to make them stay for dinner.
[14:13] What kind of a person doesn't eat at their son's engagement? She was acting like how she usually does.
[14:19] Razi didn't come as well... and sister Sajda...
What about her?
[14:23] Our daughter won't be going to Sajda's house, she'll be going to Safdar's house after her wedding.
[14:29] And I know that Safdar will keep her happy there.
[14:34] As far as Faizan is concerned...
[14:38] I know that after some time his attitude toward our daughter will change...
[14:44] Our daughter is simple and loving.
[14:48] I know that she'll make her place at her in-laws' very soon.
What about the simple engagement?
[14:55] The wedding is in two weeks. You can fulfill all your wishes then. As far as the engagement is concerned...
[15:02] it doesn't matter if it's big or small, it doesn't have any religious standing.
[15:06] But, it's not non-religious to see one's son-in-law. 
[15:10] Tell them that we are coming tomorrow and I want to meet Faizan at any cost.
[15:14] Alright, I'll tell them.
[15:19] It's time for the night prayers, I'll be right back.
[15:27] Safdar, by the grace of God you have a lovely home.
[15:31] It's all thanks to God and your prayers. It's good that you guys came by.
[15:38] In a few days, I would have invited you.
[15:45] Ever since we shifted to Karachi, we haven't visited you.
[15:50] We came to Karachi to buy some things for the wedding...
[15:57] so we decided to visit our soon-to-be son-in-law.
Faizan...
[16:04] He's out with his friends right now. Since you guys came un-informed...
[16:11] I think he'll be late in coming back. Otherwise, I would have surely stopped him from going.
[16:17] You guys drink your tea, I'll check in on lunch.
[16:26] Allow me to make an important phone call, brother Aleem. I'll be right back.
[16:33] Be hospitable.
[17:08] It's my father.
[17:12] Greetings.
Where are you?
[17:14] I'm out hunting with my friends.
[17:17] Come home immediately.
I'm very far... how can I come home right away?
[17:21] Hadia's parents are here, you need to be home.
[17:25] If they are here to meet me, tell them to come some other time. I'm very far.
[17:29] No matter how far you are...
[17:32] I don't care. I said come home immediately.
[17:36] Otherwise, I'll have your account frozen right this instance.
[17:47] What kind of blackmailing father is he?
[17:53] Sorry guys, we'll have to go back.
[17:59] I'll teach his guests a lesson.
[18:03] My brother was so stubborn, so I had to shift here.
[18:13] Hello... greetings*
Natasha...
[18:20] Guests are here... we've been waiting for you. Faizan hasn't come back as well...
[18:25] Mom, actually I went to the gym and after that, I went outside with friends.
[18:30] I lost track of time. Anyways I'm gonna go, hit the showers, and see you guys later. Bye!
[18:39] I'm sorry I'm late...
[18:42] How are you?
I'm well.
[18:45] What was the emergency that you called me here for? 
[18:48] I told mother that I would be late, what was the rush?
[18:51] Faizan, maybe you didn't recognize them. This is uncle Aleem and his wife, your auntie.
[18:57] They are your in-laws as well.
I've met them. What more shall I do?
[19:04] Son, we came here with the sherwani for you to see...
[19:11] For what?
To wear at the wedding.
[19:22] Whose wedding is it? It's mine, so I'll choose my clothes. 
[19:27] I told you, and you should have conveyed that message to him.
[19:39] Look, son, this is a ritual...
[19:44] And in our culture, the bride's family sends the groom's suit.
[19:50] Son, that's why we wanted you to try it on. 
[19:54] If there's any alteration needed, then we'll ask the tailor to do it.
[19:59] Apart from that, your auntie brought some gifts for you and Fizza...
[20:05] You guys went to the trouble for no reason...
[20:07] There was no need for this...
[20:11] I only wear a select few things and a sherwani...
[20:17] is not one of them. You should have told them.
[20:22] Son... they've brought that sherwani with love...
Don't force it, father.
[20:28] You know I don't like sherwani and looking at it...
[20:33] what is that red thing?
[20:36] I don't like the color. I feel suffocated just looking at it. 
[20:41] You can take it away with you when you leave.
[20:50] Why didn't you guys bring Hadia?
Hadia?
[21:00] You should have brought Hadia. This way I would have met her. 
[21:04] I've only heard her praises and looked at her picture.
[21:09] Nowadays everything is so artificial, with all the makeup and filter. 
[21:14] One can never know what someone looks like in person.
[21:16] Sometimes people are completely different from their photographs.
[21:31] My dear, it's not in their culture for the bride to come to the groom's house before the wedding.
[21:42] It makes no sense. 
[21:45] She has to come here after the wedding and live here with me. Then why not before the wedding?
[21:50] It's absurd.
[21:56] Faizan enough.
[23:21] He was an ill-mannered and disrespectful man. Did you see their daughter?
[23:26] She was so bold!
[23:29] I was so embarrassed in front of brother.
[23:36] They had no respect for how to speak to one's elders.
[23:44] I told you that it was important to meet Faizan, but you paid no heed to me.
[23:52] You just believed what your friend told you.
[23:57] Do you see the outcome? Look how he betrayed you.
Silence Khadija!
[24:04] I'm already very worried.
[24:08] I've made a grave mistake.
[24:12] What can I do now?
Clearly refuse, what else?
[24:19] The wedding is after a week... the invitations have been sent out. I'm sure they've reached by now.
[24:29] We will be defamed and people will make a meal out of it.
[24:35] They will ask questions...
[24:38] People will raise questions about Hadia's character...
[24:43] Safdar won't lose anything.
[24:47] He won't lose a thing.
It's a matter of our daughter's life.
[24:53] There is nothing greater than her happiness.
[25:00] Don't pressurize me by saying such things.
[25:05] My head is pounding with pain hearing such things.
[25:13] I feel like picking up the phone and asking him...
[25:39] It would have been better if I would have been childless instead of having a son like him.
[25:45] You were wrong to slap me for those two-bit people.
[25:53] Shut up your nonsense and get out!
[26:03] I made a grave mistake...
[26:08] fixing this ill-mannered man's marriage to that innocent woman.
[26:14] There's still time to rectify that mistake. Besides, they know Faizan's real face...
[26:22] This is a wedding... not a game we can start and end at any moment.
[26:29] Your son has no respect, but that girl does.
[26:34] What will she go through, 
[26:36] when she learns that her relationship broke off two days before the wedding?
[26:41] Go and make your disobedient son understand, otherwise I will surely remove him from my inheritance!
[26:51] Go!
[26:59] Do you see?
[27:02] Look what they are doing with me.
[27:06] He's a child, don't be so angry.
[27:11] Cool yourself down.
[27:24] What more could have been expected from him, that's what brother Faizan is like.
[27:29] I'm worried about Hadia, Lord knows how badly Faizan will treat her.
[27:36] You don't need to worry about Hadia, whatever that's happening to her is right.
[27:42] She hurt brother Razi's heart, so God has written her fate with a man like brother Faizan.
[27:47] It's good what happened to her.
Don't say that.
[27:52] It is possible that Hadia never loved Razi. 
Razi could have had a misunderstanding as well...
[27:58] Indeed and that has what happened. I'm sure that Hadia never loved him.
[28:06] She was playing with his emotions and brother Razi is acting crazy for her.
[28:16] We can't change what happened. Pray that Razi escapes her memories.
[28:22] May he forget her. I can't see my son in pain.
[28:27] Yes mother
[28:30] I talked to brother Razi as well. I tried making him understand.
[28:35] God willing, he will forget. I asked him to forget Hadia and her memory.
[28:40] But you have to do one thing as well.
[28:43]  Arrange for us to leave this house, because if Hadia comes here...
[28:48] then I won't be able to tolerate her either.
What are you saying?
[28:52] I'm worried because of Razi and now you're speaking his tongue as well.
[28:56] It's not as easy to leave this place, as you guys think it is. I want to leave as well...
[29:02] But at least let me talk to Safdar...
[29:06] And listen to me, until then you can't say anything untoward.
[29:12] And you have to keep Razi in control as well.
Sure.
[29:26] Thank God you guys are back. It seems they were very hospitable.
[29:32] As they should, after all, you're his father-in-law.
[29:37] Mother, what happened?
[29:42] What happened, why is she crying? Father, what's happened to her?
[29:46] My dear.... she's getting emotional thinking of Hadia's wedding.
[29:53] She's been crying over anything since yesterday. I've tried making her understand but...
[30:03] It's now like your sister is moving to a different country, you can meet her any time.
[30:08] And sister can come here at any moment.
[30:14] Tell me, did brother Faizan like the sherwani, and did he like the perfumes I sent?
[30:21] He did, right?
My dear, your mother is very tired right now...
[30:25] The travel was very long...
[30:29] Keep these questions for tomorrow morning.
[30:35] Did you guys eat?
We...
[30:40] ate, my dear.
[30:43] Shall I make tea?
Sure.
[30:49] I'll be right back.
[31:01] Why are you worrying her?
[32:29] Why would you pick up my phone now?
[32:35] You are greedy and a liar.
[32:40] There was greed behind your innocence.
[32:56] It's not your fault, it's mine.
[34:25] Hadia!
Yes, father?
[34:27] Hadia my dear?
[34:31] My dear, have you seen my silver socks?
[34:36] I've been looking for them for a while, and I can't find them.
[34:37] I gave them to Jerry, I've bought new ones for you.
[34:41] Why did you give them to Jerry? I could have worn them a few more times.
[34:47] Father, we went out shopping and we bought some socks as well...
[34:53] so I decided to buy a pair for you.
[34:57] I didn't want to go, and Fizza forced me to go.
[35:02] It's alright... it's obvious you guys went to buy things that you two needed.
[35:08] Give me those socks then.
[35:12] Father, wear the white pair today. You can wear the new pair with the new suit, the day after tomorrow.
[35:17] With the new suit?
[35:20] Why would I wear a new suit, the day after tomorrow?
[35:24] The Mayun function is the day after tomorrow.
[35:34] Alright, my dear.
[35:53] Forgive me, dear.
It's alright mother.
[35:57] You'll take the medicine and tomorrow morning you'll be alright. 
[36:00] The Mayun is tomorrow and you have to get better at all costs.
[36:07] I'll make soup for you and be right back.
[36:19] Have mercy on my child
[36:23] Forgive me.
[37:14] Sir, all the preparations are done, it looks good, right?
[37:20] I've placed everything, including the lights and the flowers.
[37:30] Father...
[37:33] This drum seems off, please find us a small dholki.
[37:38] Alright?
[38:05] Did you talk to the girls?
[38:11] I couldn't find the courage to.
[38:16] They are so happy, how can I talk to them?
[38:25] Safdar called...
[38:29] What did you say?
What could I have said...
[38:35] How can I listen to him...
[38:38] and how can I tell him what's going on in my heart?
[38:45] The things going in my head...
[38:50] is making my heart anxious.
[39:45] Who can it be ringing the bell so late at night?
Lord knows who it is.
[39:51] Let me check.
