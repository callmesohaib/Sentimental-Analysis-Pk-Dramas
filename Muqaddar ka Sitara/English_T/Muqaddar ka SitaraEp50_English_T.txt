[00:54] Many congratulations to you all.
Thank you*
[00:59] Father, when are you marrying Natasha then?
Whenever sister asks me to.
[01:06] What should I do? I have to marry Farwa first, as her in-laws are insisting upon it.
[01:13] Otherwise, I wanted to marry the two of them together.
[01:18] It's alright. Farwa is like my daughter as well. Besides, it will take some time for Natasha to get better.
[01:28] I'm in no rush to get Natasha married, as she is my only daughter.
[01:34] I will arrange her wedding with all pageantry. It will be a grander marriage than Faizan's.
[01:41] Go ahead and marry Farwa. As we'll be waiting for Natasha's wedding.
[01:49] Natasha, you must be tired, go home and rest.
[01:54] I was about to say the same thing. Go and rest my dear.
[01:59] Take her Farwa.
Sure, come on Natasha.
[02:07] I'm tired, so I should go as well.
Where are you going? I need your advice on Farwa's wedding.
[02:15] Whatever it is you can discuss it with sister, why do you need me?
[02:22] There is nothing to worry about. Let me prepare for the wedding.
[02:26] Father, you can take the important decisions, whereas I will do all of the shopping for the wedding.
[02:31] Wow... you've sorted out all the problems. Thank you, my dear.
[02:59] Mother...
[03:01] You know me very well, still, you took this decision. How can I even do this?
[03:10] Yes mother, how could you even think that brother Razi can agree to marry Natasha?
[03:17] You gave her the ring, what if you had taken back on your word...
Then that would have been that.
[03:24] I would have told them that I did that only because of her childish behavior.
What if she had tried to do something like that again?
[03:31] I admit that I made a mistake. But now, will you not maintain a keepsake of your mother's word?
[03:39] That's what I did. Didn't I put the ring on her?
[03:45] My dear, you'll have to commit yourself to this relationship as well.
[03:51] Safdar already has...
Sure...
[03:54] Uncle Safdar already has done a lot of favors for us! For God's sake, enough mother!
[04:06] I think that even if I give him the rest of my life, even then you won't be satisfied.
[04:13] I'm ashamed and regretful of my mistake.
[04:32] What's the point in you being ashamed?
[04:36] My life has been ruined. Alright then...
[04:43] I have always agreed with everything you've asked me to do. In the future, I will carry on doing the same. I will never let you be ashamed.
[04:57] Are you happy now? Stay happy then.
[05:06] Why and how did this happen?
[05:10] Mother, you know brother very well. You know brother has never talked to you like that.
[05:19] I don't understand how all this happened.
[05:25] Why did I have such a big misunderstanding?
[05:31] Don't worry about it too much. We can't change what happened. Pray that God finds a solution for this.
[05:59] Your doubt should be cleared away now. Razi is marrying your sister.
[06:03] He's lying, he deceiving Natasha and all of us.
[06:10] He's doing all of this so that he can prove that I'm a liar.
[06:14] Natasha likes Razi, but he doesn't like her.
[06:20] She tried committing suicide for him. She's after him. Razi isn't after her.
[06:29] If you're still not aware of that then that is a shame.
[06:34] Even after living in the same house, you're unaware of your sister's feelings.
You know what Hadia...
[06:40] your speech won't have any effect on me.
[06:44] Your deeds will be hidden behind this marriage. Natasha can be a fool, but not me.
[06:51] One day... if not today, then tomorrow, I will prove all this.
[07:23] Razi...
[07:26] Can we talk for a minute?
[07:30] What is it?
[07:33] Did you give me that ring because you were compelled to?
[07:42] There is no point in asking that question.
Razi, I feel embarrassed.
[07:49] I think that my suicide threats and what my mother said compelled you to give that ring to me.
[07:56] It's not like that Natasha, please...
[08:00] Razi, I know that I'm not your ideal and you don't like girls like me.
[08:11] You're right... I'm really sorry, but...
[08:17] I don't like emotional girls like you, who are prone to giving suicide threats.
[08:27] Anyways, you got what you wanted. There's no point in this anymore.
[08:33] If you really want to change yourself for me, then, please...
[08:39] become smart and mature. Try saying good things.
[08:45] Make new friends, read books... have discussions. If you do all this...
[08:53] then I'll start liking you more.
[08:58] Anyways, how are you feeling now?
[09:02] Better...
Good.
[09:06] And yes, Farwa's wedding is near...
[09:09] help her. Girls have a lot of problems, such as clothes, make-up...
[09:16] Help her as a sister...
I will.
[09:20] Good. I like responsible girls.
[09:24] Be responsible. I'm going out to buy a few things. Do you want anything?
[09:31] Actually, I wanted a dress for Farwa's wedding. If you could buy something for me...
[09:48] Okay... farewell*
[10:09] Fizza my dear...
[10:18] Yes, father? You must be tired, should I bring you a glass of water?
No, my dear.
[10:22] Forget about that and sit down.
[10:29] Here you go.
[10:45] Father, thank you so much.
You're most welcome my dear.
[10:52] After so many days I've seen you so happy. Believe me...
[10:58] that has made me very happy.
Don't worry. You won't be troubled by me anymore.
[11:06] I will study hard.
I have full faith in you.
[11:13] My dear... it's better if you forget about the past and think about your future.
[11:21] God willing, you will become a big doctor someday. May God give you success.
[11:33] Fizza.... my dear your phone has been ringing for a while.
It's my college friend, let me talk to her.
[11:44] What is this?
Take a look.
[11:52] Oh my... it's done?
Yes, our daughter's migration is done.
[11:57] God willing, she'll go to a different university. By God's good graces, Fizza is very happy.
[12:05] May God keep it that way.
May God give her success as well.
[12:15] How are you?
I'm fine. Where are you? Do you know how many times I called you?
[12:23] And you didn't call me back once. Your cousin came to university...
[12:31] didn't he give you my message?
Yes...
[12:36] brother Razi told me.
Still, you didn't call me, and you left your studies as well.
[12:44] And you didn't even come to visit us.
I don't want to come there.
[12:49] Whatever happened to me, I want to forget it.
[12:56] I don't want to make any friends. Don't ever call me back.
Will you forget our friendship?
[13:09] Fizza, listen to me.
[13:32] Five crores? What are you saying?
[13:37] There is nothing I can do to dispense such a large amount from the accounts.
[13:42] My future depends on this.
Sir this is a matter of my life.
[13:48] Mr. Faizan, minor thefts are okay, but committing fraud on such a large scale...
[13:54] I cannot do that. If Mr. Safdar finds out he will have me thrown in jail for a lifetime.
[14:01] You turned out to be useless. You have disappointed me.
[14:06] I'm very compelled, please try to understand.
If that's the case, then sure. But there is something that you have to do.
[14:16] Sir, don't let it be anything difficult. I don't have much domain.
[14:22] Once I open up my office, I will give you all the powers.
[14:30] Sir, if it's like that, then tell me what it is.
[14:36] The thing you have to do is...
[14:54] This is the phone number and all the details. Verify it for me and let me know.
[15:05] Think that this is done.
Thanks.
[15:11] But tell me something. First, it was that phone, and now it's this.
[15:18] What's the deal?
[15:23] There is a man at work who has run away after stealing some money.
[15:29] We're tracking him.
Alright...
[15:34] Don't worry... I will find out in a day or two and let you know.
[15:40] Thank you...
[16:18] There's an event going on and you're sitting here. Come outside.
[16:26] You go ahead, what are you doing here?
[16:30] I'm here to take you outside. If not for me, then do it for the world. Everyone is asking me where you are.
[16:39] Then tell them the truth, I can't lie in front of the world like you. Father asked me to stay, otherwise, I would have left a long time ago.
[16:48] This noise is giving me a headache.
Do you need medicine?
[16:54] I need peace, can I get that?
[17:00] Father asked me to go shopping with you tomorrow, for Farwa's wedding.
[17:06] What should I tell him?
I'm busy, I don't have time for this. Go with either mother or Natasha.
[17:17] I expected that much, but still, I thought I should ask.
[17:26] I will tell father the same thing. If he asks you, tell him the same.
[17:34] Close the door on your way out.
[19:45] Razi...
[19:48] Yes, mother?
Drink coffee.
[19:55] You guys stayed up for so long last night. Farwa is still sleeping.
[20:04] Mother, let her sleep...
[20:09] Only two days are left till her wedding.
[20:12] Yes... there's still a lot to do.
[20:16] I feel worried thinking about it. There's still a lot to do at the market. How will we complete them all?
[20:25] God willing, everything will be done.
[20:28] Don't worry about it.
[20:30] Tell me... did you go to the jeweler?
[20:36] I'll go in the evening today.
[20:40] Natasha said that she'll go with me. I'll take all of you together.
[20:47] That's very good. We'll go altogether. They can buy whatever they like.
[20:55] My dear, ask Safdar for a few days off from work.
[21:04] Alright, I'll ask uncle that.
[21:11] I want to visit my brother Aleem and give him the card personally.
[21:19] Alright, mother... I don't think brother Aleem...
[21:24] and his wife will come to the wedding.
[21:30] That's why I want to go. I want to end all the complaints and misunderstandings.
[21:37] Alright fine.
[21:41] I'll take you to Hyderabad.
[21:44] Tell me, have you created a list of all the guests?
[21:51] Make sure that we don't forget anyone. If you forget something, ask me.
[21:56] No mother, all the lists are done. I've saved them on my cellphone as well, don't worry
[22:05] Alright fine. There's a lot to do, let me check in on them.
[26:13] They are Hadia's in-laws, that's why I came. Otherwise, I would never have come here.
[26:19] Forget about that Khadija...
[26:24] Sister Sajda visited us from a long way to give us the invitation. We had to come here.
[26:33] I've come here only because of her love and respect.
[26:38] Otherwise, I don't even want to talk to anyone here.
[26:44] You may be right about that. But Razi and sister Sajda are not at fault for anything that happened.
[26:53] Besides, Razi is a respectful man.
[26:58] He is an honorable man and he helped me that day.
[27:05] Their only mistake is that they live here. If sister Sajda was living somewhere else...
[27:12] then I would have helped her out. But I don't even feel like stepping foot inside this house.
[27:21] You're right.
[27:24] I think the marriage ceremony has been done.
It seems to be...
[30:43] Give my sister the respect and love which every wife deserves.
[30:50] Thank you.
[31:38] Sister...
[31:41] Thank God that everything went very well.
[31:45] We can't thank God enough.
[31:50] May God always keep our daughter happy in that place.
[31:55] Amen... thank God who helped us fulfill my responsibility towards my daughter.
[32:04] Thank you, Safdar, you have always helped me at every turn.
[32:11] Don't embarrass me. It was all thanks to God that this happened.
[32:18] Your son worked hard on it.
Yes, Safdar, I thank God...
[32:23] for giving me, such obedient children.
No doubt.
[32:32] Faizan... the way Razi participated in Farwa's wedding, will you do that for my wedding, or will you stay busy on your phone?
[32:49] Faizan?
[32:57] Was someone talking to me?
[33:02] I'm really tired and I'm going to my room.
[33:06] Safdar... Natasha is well now. Tell me...
[33:12] when will you give me her wedding date?
[33:18] Sister, she's your sister. You can take her away whenever you want.
[33:23] Thank you. I expected this from you.
[34:20] Greetings*
What is it?
[34:25] Is this Fawad's home? I wanted to meet him.
He's not at home. Did you have something for him?
[34:31] Actually, I was from his college. He's gotten a scholarship from us and I wanted to discuss that with him.
[34:38] When will he be back?
He has left for Nawabshah.
[34:42] Nawabshah? What does that mean?
[34:47] He said that the college has sent him to study in Nawabshah for a few days.
[34:54] Where is he staying in Nawabshah? Is he staying at a hostel or a relative's house? Can I get their number?
[35:01] No... we don't have any relatives there. He calls sometimes.
[35:08] He contacts the shop at the end of the corner.
Alright...
[35:13] I'll come back after two months. You stay in contact with him, right?
Yes. If the college is asking for him, then he will surely come.
[35:22] Sure... we'll call him. This is some money...
[35:29] from the college. This is my...
[35:35] visiting card. It has my number on it...
[35:39] As soon as you contact him, please let me know. And I have a request...
[35:46] don't tell Fawad about this. He'll be very happy when he gets this money as a surprise...
[35:53] But be sure to contact him.
Yes, I will. Farewell*
[36:20] Are you busy? Can I talk to you right now?
Sure brother Razi, what is it?
[36:25] That man has run away to Nawabshah.
What? He's ran away?
[36:31] But why, how... when?
I don't know that but...
[36:35] he will come back. His mother would have told him by now and if he is greedy...
[36:42] then he will come back soon.
But why did he run away?
[36:46] Was he afraid of someone?
I don't know about that as well.
[36:52] Anyways... don't worry about it, he will come back.
204
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,895a
Trust me... tell me... what happened about your new admission?
[37:04] Everything is done. I'm joining a different university starting tomorrow.
[37:09] Great. Good luck. Don't worry, I'll update you as soon as that man comes back.
[37:17] Leave this problem to me... one matter where he hides...
[37:21] I will find him.
Sure. Farewell...
[37:26] Good luck. Farewell.
