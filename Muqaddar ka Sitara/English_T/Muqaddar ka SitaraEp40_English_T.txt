[01:11] hello!
[01:12] greetings! how are you Fizza?
[01:15] greetings to you too!
you!
[01:18] this seems Pakistani number
[01:21] yes, its Pakistan's number because I'm in Pakistan
[01:25] you came to Pakistan, but you didn't tell me
[01:28] I thought to give you a surprise!
[01:32] really! so... 
[01:34] Ok tell me, tomorrow shall I pick you from the university?
[01:38] what!
[01:39] yes? Lets go on a coffee & talk something about our future
[01:43] actually, I've come to Pakistan for two months that's why
[01:47] why don't you come to my house, we will meet over there
[01:51] I will come to your house too
[01:53] but will you mind if we will sit & talk in private for some time?
[01:59] if you can please take permission from my father
[02:03] yes, let me call & seek permission from uncle
[02:06] Okay, bye!
[02:08] Okay
[02:10] bye!
[02:28] mom
[02:30] didn't you talk to aunt as of yet?
[02:33] Natasha look! if you think that I will go & talk to your aunt, then its not possible at all
[02:40] but mom please
[02:42] Natasha please
[02:44] if Razi is also interested in you, then ask him to go & tell his mother
[02:48] then your aunt will come to seek your proposal from me
[02:51] then it will be possible otherwise its not possible at all!
[02:54] but I... 
[02:56] what's up?
[02:58] I was passing by so I heard Razi's name, am I right?
[03:04] you heard it right
[03:07] why were you guys discussing him?
[03:10] ask your sister
[03:15] what's up?
[03:18] nothing!
[03:21] Ok, leave her
[03:23] you tell me, last night I heard some noise of fighting from your room. What is the matter?
[03:32] nothing! I was talking on the phone. You must have felt that way
[03:35] tell me about Razi, what is it?
Faizan... 
[03:38] you have started to hide something from me
[03:40] I will tell you on the right time, then I will tell everyone
[03:44] but tell me why were you discussing Razi, what's happening?
[03:50] your sister has started to like him now
[03:54] wait what!
[03:58] have you gone mad!
[03:59] first Sherry & now Razi, don't you have a caliber?
[04:02] its not going to happen, Ok?
[04:04] she got rid of Sherry few days ago, and now Razi's chapter got opened. What's happening?
[04:10] I am trying to oust him from the factory & she is trying to involve him more in the house. Its not going to happen, Ok?
[04:15] I hate that guy!
[04:32] what do you mean, you gave permission?
[04:36] see, he took permission from me & I liked it
[04:43] this shows his obedience and... 
[04:47] upbringing too
[04:50] now see, if he would have reached Fizza's hostel without seeking my permission
[04:56] then what I would have done?
[04:59] you are right
[05:02] but they will be noticed by people
[05:05] and its just an engagement
[05:07] if he wanted to talk to her, then he could have come here 
[05:12] yes... but its fine Khadija
[05:16] the time has changed
[05:19] and we should change our thinking too
[05:25] with time, I've come to a conclusion that... 
[05:29] if we give importance to our children likes & dislikes when it comes to the matter of their wedding
[05:36] then they spend their lives happily
[05:41] otherwise, they keep on fighting uselessly by making a mole out of mountains
[05:51] I hadn't thought about it while marrying Hadia
[05:57] but... 
[05:59] thanks to God a million times
[06:04] he kept my honor intact
[06:07] although, you also know that
[06:11] in the beginning, our daughter had to face a lot of hardships
[06:22] but thanks to God that now things are quite better
[06:47] don't know whether dad had given the permission or not
[06:50] Nisar will mind if dad had refused
[06:54] oh God! I'm stuck in such a big problem
[07:04] this is the same number from which Nisar had called on that day
[07:07] what shall I do?
[07:11] hello! greetings!
[07:14] Fizza, there is a bad news
[07:15] I'm really sorry, I knew it my father won't allow. I apologize on his behalf
[07:21] please don't mind, I'm really sorry
[07:26] are you laughing?
[07:27] yes, I'm laughing because your father hadn't refused. In fact he had allowed me to take you
[07:35] what!
[07:36] I mean, why didn't you tell me before?
[07:40] if I would have told you on the spot then how you would have realized the importance of your father & respect of your to be husband
[07:46] oh...
[07:48] ok, I'll talk to you later as its my class time
[07:51] Ok fine, but be ready tomorrow
[07:54] see you tomorrow then
[07:55] yes, bye!
[08:21] Khadija's call
[08:23] at this hour!
[08:26] what's the problem!
[08:28] hello!
[08:29] greetings, sister Sheena. I hope I haven't disturbed you by calling at this time
[08:36] No, not at all. Tell me what is it?
[08:39] sister, actually I wanted to talk to you about Hadia
[08:44] about what?
[08:47] I was saying, if you can take good care of her
[08:53] actually girls misses their homes during such times, specially their mothers
[08:59] and I'm not there
[09:01] I agree that a mother in law is also like a mother, therefore if you can please take good care of her
[09:07] sister Khadija look! you don't need to tell this to me
[09:11] I know how to take care of my daughter in law
[09:15] she has got all the luxuries of this world
[09:17] she eats very well, she wears very well. What else does she want?
[09:22] No, no.. I was just
Khadija look
[09:26] one should not interfere in their daughter's in-laws matters
[09:30] otherwise their families gets ruined
[09:34] God forbid sister, what are you saying!
[09:37] I'm saying the right thing
[09:39] Next time, think before calling
[09:45] yes sister
[09:46] your daughter is Safder Kamal's daughter in law, its not a small thing
[09:51] bye!
[10:46] Khadija's call?
[10:50] hello! greetings!
[10:53] greetings to you too!
[10:55] how are you?
I hope I haven't disturbed you
[10:59] oh no no Khadija, what are you saying!
[11:01] I wait for your call myself
[11:06] tell me, is everything alright?
[11:08] yes
[11:10] actually I am so worried about Hadia
[11:17] last time I saw her when she came back with Faizan
[11:24] at that time, I saw weird emptiness on her face 
[11:29] since then I'm feeling so anxious
[11:33] I feel as if she is hiding something from me
[11:37] No, no there isn't any such thing. Hadia is very happy, don't worry
[11:43] you know, a girl always misses her mother in this condition
[11:49] and I cannot stay with her at all times
[11:55] I don't have any expectations with sister Sheena
[11:59] I want to request you
[12:01] can you please take special care of Hadia for my sake?
[12:05] what are you saying? Hadia is also like my daughter
[12:09] if you wouldn't have said, still I would have taken good care of her
[12:13] remove all the delusions for her from your heart
[12:17] all praise to God, she is very happy & pray
[12:20] that God keeps her happy with Faizan
[12:23] may their marriage be blessed
[12:27] Amen
[12:29] thank you sister!
[12:30] thank you so much
[12:32] Ok, bye!
[12:35] bye!
[13:01] Momal, come here for a minute
yes?
[13:03] come here
[13:07] tell me, how is this dress looking?
[13:10] its good
[13:12] is it good or very good?
[13:13] its very nice, but why are you asking me like this?
[13:16] you had never taken anyone's suggestion while selecting your dress
[13:19] yes, but today I am a bit confused that's why I am asking
[13:23] why so, what as such has happened?
[13:26] actually Nisar is in Pakistan, so tomorrow I am going to meet him
[13:30] oh my God! I mean all of this is happening & nobody is telling us
[13:34] I wouldn't have gone without informing you, I would have informed you first
[13:37] actually he called me abruptly that's why
[13:39] Ok tell me, is this dress looking good?
[13:41] no matter whatever my friend wears, everything suits her
[13:44] and this dress is really nice
[13:46] really!
[13:47] Nisar is in Pakistan since few days, that's why I am going to meet him
[13:52] by the way, where your to be husband will take you?
[13:56] he didn't tell me that where will we go
[13:58] yesterday he had called & asked me to be ready as he will come to pick me from the university 
[14:02] I see, so this is the matter
[14:03] Ok fine, thank you!
[14:08] yesterday did you guys had a fight in the office?
[14:14] what do you guys think?
[14:17] if you guys will not tell me, then won't I get to know?
[14:21] No uncle
[14:23] there isn't any such thing
[14:25] we were having a discussion on a deal
[14:29] and we had an argument over it
[14:33] since when Faizan has started to take so much interest in office work that you guys had an argument on the deal?
[14:41] you are right, dad
[14:45] there wasn't any discussion on the deal, it was a personal matter. Very personal matter!
[14:51] what kind of personal matter? Tell me, I would like to know
[14:57] if the matter is about personal matter, then listen to me uncle. This guy!
[15:04] this guy doesn't used to go to the university, I got to know this later
[15:07] he has been taking quite a hefty amount from the manager, by making an excuse of the university
[15:11] stop your rubbish!
one minute!
[15:13] he is provoking you against me
[15:15] uncle, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanted to discuss this matter but... 
[15:18] this guy is still meeting Ramsha secretly!
[15:21] what!
[15:24] what is he saying?
[15:27] Faizan... 
[15:28] is this true?
[15:30] you are still in contact with that sly girl?
[15:35] you have deceived me once again? You had lied to me!
[15:38] I'm sorry!
[15:40] I'm really sorry that I lied to you & deceived you. But he is not a pious man as well
[15:48] if you get to know what he did, then maybe you won't be able to listen
[15:53] what he did?
[15:55] I took money from you by lying, right?
[15:58] if you get to know what he did, then you will push him & oust from this house
[16:01] don't beat about the bush!
[16:03] tell me the matter clearly!
[16:17] he is having an affair with your daughter in law!
[16:20] what!
[16:27] what rubbish!
[16:29] what!
[16:35] glass.. 
[16:41] what rubbish you are talking?
[16:43] you should be ashamed of talking like this!
[16:47] I'm telling the truth, I'm in my complete senses
[16:51] both of them were having an affair before our marriage, tell him!
[16:54] Hadia, why don't you tell him that he came to the farm house to meet you!
[17:02] he came, but not to meet me
[17:19] uncle
[17:21] I haven't gone to Islamabad as per my will
[17:24] you had sent me, right?
[17:28] but this guy!
[17:31] this guy has stooped so low in my jealousy that he is putting false allegation on his wife!
[17:44] he should be ashamed
[17:47] ask him
[17:49] if he has a proof then show us
[17:51] stop your rubbish!
[18:01] I will talk to you later
[18:04] I swear dad, I had a proof. I had a video in my phone
[18:08] I don't know where that video has gone
go away from here!
[18:11] be quiet & get lost!
[18:17] you can stoop so low
[18:20] you are putting a false allegation on your pious wife, just to degrade him in front of me?
[18:25] I am feeling ashamed while calling you my son
[18:29] you have forgotten the fact that she is about to become the mother of your baby!
[18:34] I swear dad I'm telling the truth, at least believe me for once please. I had a proof
[18:40] go away from my sight otherwise I will kill you
Safder!
[18:43] leave him!
[18:46] do you want to know the truth?
[18:48] he is doing all of this in Razi's jealousy
[18:50] he is jealous of him & his achievements
[18:53] and while doing this he didn't even noticed
[18:56] and blamed his pious wife. Get lost!
[19:00] take him away from here
[19:21] uncle... 
[20:19] enough Safder, now there is no reason left for us to stay here
[20:24] Shina & your children behavior was already so bad with us
[20:28] and now Faizan! he has crossed all the limits
[20:32] is this how my son's hard work is re payed?
[20:36] is this how his honesty is re paid?
[20:40] my children never wanted to live here
[20:43] they stayed here upon my orders & my request
[20:47] and I respected you all your life
[20:49] whatever I had tolerated is because of you
[20:54] but one's favors shouldn't be repaid by humiliating others
[20:59] you are right, sister
[21:03] I respect you a lot, you are my elder sister
[21:06] I am so guilty
[21:09] and about Razi I...
[21:11] I can never think this way
[21:14] I trust him more than myself
[21:16] and that girl Hadia is very innocent
[21:20] she can never do any such thing
[21:23] yes! you cannot think but you didn't stopped your son to do all this
[21:29] I apologize to you sister, but... 
enough Safder!
[21:32] don't stop us now
[21:33] let us go
[21:35] we will be grateful to your favors our entire life
[21:39] but don't get us humiliated a lot that we shall feel so ashamed
[21:43] may God bless you guys & keep you happy
[21:47] let us leave
[21:49] how come like this?
[21:51] dear Razi, please convince your mother
[21:53] I accept whether Faizan said & did was wrong, but I didn't questioned you at all
[22:00] uncle...
[22:00] dear, I beg in front of you
[22:02] please, what are you doing?
[22:04] please don't do this!
[22:08] you are like my father
[22:12] don't make me guilty by apologizing like this, in fact I apologize to you
[22:16] No.. if you want to do something then please
[22:21] convince your mother, please
[22:40] which evidence Faizan was talking about?
[22:42] what does he have?
[22:45] tell me!
[23:02] I'm not saying it uselessly
[23:06] here is something in between both of them
[23:10] I had made a video but the phone got snatched, otherwise I would have shown it to everyone
[23:13] just shut up, Faizan
[23:15] go & tell these stories to someone else
[23:18] not just your father, even I am not going to bind to this rubbish
[23:23] whatever it was earlier, no matter I don't used to like Hadia
[23:27] but I'm sure
[23:30] that she is not bad in character
[23:34] and even Razi is not like that
[23:36] you don't know Faizan, you've done so wrong
[23:40] you've insulted your wife & her to be born baby in the jealousy of Razi
[23:46] what's wrong with you!
[23:49] stay out of it
[23:51] I know why are you taking his side
[23:55] yes, I like him
[23:57] and I trust him too
[24:00] even you have started to like Hadia, Right?
[24:03] then you should have trusted her, Faizan
[24:07] but you have insulted your wife in front of everyone
[24:12] if you had some problem or jealousy with Razi then
[24:16] you should have taken out your anger on him, like a man
[24:22] what was the need to drag your wife in all of this?
[24:28] I'm telling you the last time
[24:31] don't interfere in my matters, stay out of it
[24:37] even I don't like to interfere in your matters, Faizan
[24:40] but your matter is creating problems in my life
[24:45] you do realize that if Razi left this house in anger, then he will never marry me
[24:51] and have you thought about dad's loss?
[24:55] what if he left going to the office then who is going to help dad?
[24:59] you don't do a single work!
[25:04] don't dare to speak ill about Faizan in front of your father
[25:13] did you see?
[25:15] how low your son has gone!
[25:20] Safder, you should have listened to him
[25:23] what I should have listened? Tell me Shine, what?
[25:26] I should listen to his disgusting allegations?
[25:28] Ok you tell me
[25:30] what do you think?
[25:32] whatever he is saying is true?
[25:34] the characters of both of them are in front of you
[25:37] look at Razi, & look at your son
[25:42] look at his personality
[25:44] look at his attitude, nature & progress towards business
[25:49] and our son!
[25:51] I feel ashamed while taking his name
[25:52] leave all this! the blame that he had put on Hadia, I will never tolerate that!
[25:58] Faizan would have never said such a big thing if there wasn't any truth in it
[26:03] earlier it was different, but now he has started to like Hadia
[26:07] both of them went to Murree (hill station) together
[26:09] they were so happy over there
[26:11] and now Hadia is about to become the mother of her baby
[26:15] Faizan would have never said any such thing
[26:19] if there wasn't any truth in it
[26:44] why such a long face?
[26:48] relax, I saved you
[26:50] you saved me?
[26:53] Faizan, you got me humiliated in front of all
[26:59] but my father didn't said a single word to you
[27:01] he had raised his hand on me, he choked my throat
[27:04] if you think that he hadn't raised his hand on me, and I didn't got insulted then you are mistaken
[27:12] you've made me half dead by associating my name with Razi in front of everyone
[27:16] what is left now?
[27:20] you know what, whether you accept it or not. But you had an affair with him
[27:23] if not today, but it was there
[27:29] but the thing is that I love you
[27:31] that's why, whether dad beats me or do anything. I won't tell him or show him anything
[27:39] go & show it to everyone
[27:42] why aren't you showing it?
[27:44] what kind of love is this?
[27:47] go & show them
[27:49] go, show them... I am no scared of anyone
[28:13] Ramsha please!
[28:14] why do you always come to me in an off mood?
[28:17] I'm sick of your mood swings
[28:19] your tantrums are never ending, I'm fed up!
[28:22] Razi had told my dad about us, we have to be more careful now!
[28:26] he did very well
[28:28] Faizan, I think this is a good chance. Let's tell the truth to everyone
[28:31] have you gone mad Ramsha!
[28:34] how many times shall I tell you one thing? Why don't you get it?
[28:37] my father will not like it, he will humiliate me a lot. Why don't you understand!
[28:48] ok listen
[28:50] Faizan relax, please calm down
[28:54] lets think about something
[28:57] everything will be fine
[29:06] I will ensure to tell your father now
[29:15] Faizan, everything will be fine. I'm with you
[29:20] It will be alright
[29:23] I'm sorry!
[29:41] Razi, something might have happened there that's why Faizan was saying such things in front of all
[29:48] tell me, what had happened there?
[29:51] look, don't hide anything from me
[29:54] I know this very well, that you haven't forgotten Hadia till date
[30:02] but what as such Faizan saw over there
[30:05] what he had heard, that he was saying such things?
[30:09] no mom, there isn't any such thing
[30:14] its a misunderstanding, & nothing more than that
[30:18] I know Faizan very well, he is playing a game
[30:21] he isn't that crazy
[30:23] yes, but he is a fool
[30:25] really! so you think that your mother is also a fool
[30:28] that's why you were asking on that day, that you will never distrust me
[30:32] it means, you knew it very well that one day Faizan will bring this matter in front of all
[30:40] Razi, I was scared of the same thing
[30:44] that one day this matter will come in front of all for sure
[30:49] why didn't you tell me earlier?
[30:52] what shall I do to you?
[30:55] mom, that's why I was asking you again & again to move somewhere else from here
[30:59] really!
[31:01] it means, this is the solution of this problem?
[31:04] because I had asked you to stay away from Hadia
[31:09] I haven't done anything, nothing as such has happened. Why don't you believe me?
[31:14] I do believe you
[31:16] I trust you completely
[31:18] but why Faizan was saying such a big thing!
[31:21] after all, what had happened at the farm house?
[31:24] what had happened, tell me
[31:26] mom, nothing had happened over there
[31:30] and you know it very well that I hadn't gone there myself, uncle had sent me there
[31:34] really! so why you didn't refuse at that time? You knew it that Hadia was there
[31:40] and tell me, what was the need to complain about Faizan to his father?
[31:46] when you will say that he is having an affair with some girl
[31:50] you know his nature very well
[31:53] will he stay quiet? he will definitely put a blame on you
[31:59] you know he is jealous of you
[32:03] that's why he is putting allegations on you
[32:05] mom, if I wouldn't have told uncle then someone else would have. What's the use?
[32:09] it would have made any difference if someone else would have told, but since you've told your uncle therefore there has been a huge mess
[32:17] I am not capable to face anyone
[32:20] and that girl! that poor girl got humiliated for no reason
[32:23] I will talk about justice, Razi
[32:26] presently you are at mistake
[32:29] if you would have stayed quiet, then maybe he would have kept his mouth shut
[32:33] and your respect would have stayed intact
[32:36] it has become so difficult for me to stay here
[32:39] Safder trusts you
[32:41] but Faizan & Shina, they will exaggerate this matter for sure
[32:45] what shall I do?
[32:48] I will not stay here for a minute, I will leave
[32:52] alright!
[32:54] but now I will stay here & I don't want to go anywhere from here
[32:57] why?
[33:00] can't you feel your insult?
[33:02] the matter is not about insult
[33:05] if I will leave from here right now, then everyone will think that its my fault
[33:10] and maybe whatever Faizan is saying, everyone will believe him
[33:14] mom, I'm telling you. Till I don't clear this problem, I won't leave from here
[33:19] really! so how will you clear it? the matter is true
[33:22] the matter is not about insult
[33:24] only you know it that I & Hadia used to like each other, right?
[33:29] but after her marriage, there isn't any such thing in between us
[33:32] and neither I used to look at her in that way
[33:35] yes, it would have been wrong. If Hadia would have stayed in contact with me after her marriage
[33:40] but there isn't any such thing, mom
[33:42] I'm telling you
[33:44] I will ensure to solve this problem
[35:27] you know what, whether you accept it or not. But you had an affair with him
[35:30] if not today, but it was there
[35:46] ,but the thing is that I love you
[35:48] that's why, whether dad beats me or do anything.
[35:52] I won't tell him or show him anything
[36:41] both of them had an affair before marriage, tell him!
[36:44] Hadia, why don't you tell him that he came to the farm house to meet you.
[37:00] its good from one aspect, & bad from one aspect
[37:04] Faizan is such a coward man
[37:06] he can leave you by coming into his father's pressure
[37:10] but we won't face much loss
[37:13] 5 crores are confirmed
[37:15] I will ensure to take that money from them
[37:19] but right now, I think the loss will be ours
[37:23] if Faizan's father stopped his pocket money, then how will he be able to take care of our expenses?
[37:29] he will become so miser
[37:31] you are saying the right thing
[37:34] but don't you worry
[37:36] and for now, don't talk about money in front of Faizan
[37:42] now I will trap Faizan in a different way
[37:45] I will show him that I am like Hadia
[37:49] like Hadia?
[37:51] but how?
[37:52] by becoming an obedient & lovely wife
[37:56] Faizan likes such things
[38:00] I want to show him that I only love him, I don't have any concern with his wealth
[38:05] then you'll see
[38:09] Besides, I think that there has been a very big fight between Faizan & Hadia
[38:16] how come you get to know all this?
[38:19] nothing is confirmed, but he seems quite worried since past few days
[38:24] fights do happen between a wife & a husband, its not a big deal
[38:28] mom, this is not a normal fight
[38:30] I think, there has been a very big fight between them
[38:34] because that day Faizan was asking me, "I hope you won't be disloyal to me"
[38:40] what does this mean?
[38:42] come on, Ramsha
[38:45] because of these beautiful wives, husbands are always cautious
[38:50] and that's why he had asked you too
[38:52] because you are also very beautiful, right?
[38:57] and then Hadia is such a simple & innocent girl
[39:00] how can she do this?
oh please!
[39:03] she isn't a simple or innocent girl
[39:05] the girls who look so innocent by face, they are quite clever & sly from inside
[39:10] anyways, let them fight. Why are you getting worried?
[39:16] you should take the advantage of this situation
[39:19] the more they will fight, the more advantage you will get
[39:22] look, if he will come here in tension
[39:26] then you become more closer to him
[39:28] and... then you'll see
[39:31] one day he will come out of his delusion
