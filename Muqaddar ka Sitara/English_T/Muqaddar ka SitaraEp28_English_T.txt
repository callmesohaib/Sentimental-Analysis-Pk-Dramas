[01:04] Natasha, your father said it only in anger
[01:07] okay?
[01:08] and you know his anger
[01:10] it comes and goes like a wave
[01:12] mother?
[01:13] I won't let father do this injustice to me
[01:17] how did he think to disown me?
[01:23] he is short tempered?
[01:24] I'm too. I'm his daughter
[01:27] now you'll see
[01:29] I will go to court and hire a good lawyer
[01:32] and I will take my share
[01:40] and mother, I don't want to live in this country anymore
[01:43] I am a U.S. citizen and I want to go back to U.S.
[01:47] Don't you dare do something that would make your father upset again
[01:53] its better
[01:55] to stay silent for few days
[01:58] and then I'll convince your father and bring to you
[02:02] you know that your father can't stay upset for long
[02:06] Stop lying to me, mother please
[02:09] you always say this and nothing happens later
[02:14] fine, I made a mistake
[02:16] but I don't deserve all of this
[02:19] and which father does this to his daughter or children
[02:24] I know it
[02:26] but I'm helpless right now
[02:28] Natasha, please try to understand
[02:30] Trust me
[02:32] He will forgive you in sometime, and bring you home
[02:36] how many days are passed that I'm here
[02:39] and father has disowned me?
[02:43] you are still saying that things will be alright
[02:47] enough Natasha
[02:49] enough!
[02:50] why aren't you trusting me?
[02:56] I'm telling you
[02:57] that I will convince your father
[03:01] its better
[03:02] that you stay quiet for few days
[03:05] and don't worry about money. I'll keep sending
[03:08] but don't you dare to think ..
[03:10] to go to court
[03:13] why do you want ..
[03:15] us to be disappointed in front of the world?
[03:18] and I'm sure, this disgusting suggestion of going to court
[03:21] is given by Sherry
[03:24] Natasha, I'll call back
[03:49] you?
[03:51] yes!
[03:52] Natasha wants to go to court against me?
[03:55] she wasn't to disappoint her father?
[03:59] she would hire a lawyer against me?
[04:03] she's just saying these things. She's emotional
[04:07] you
[04:10] you might not know
[04:12] but I was thinking to forgive her today
[04:15] but now I completely trust that my children
[04:18] are selfish
[04:20] and greedy
[04:23] they just love
[04:25] luxuries and wealth
[04:28] not me
[04:33] do one thing
[04:35] keep it in your mind
[04:38] from today
[04:39] you won't stay in contact with Natasha, neither will you send any money in her account
[04:43] I can't do this
[04:46] and you can't be this cold. She's our daughter
[04:49] neither would I leave talking to her
[04:51] nor stop caring about her
[04:53] okay!
[04:56] if you really cared about her
[04:58] then you would have raised her
[05:01] the way sister raised both her daughters
[05:04] enough
[05:06] enough of praising them
[05:08] I'm frustrated
[05:09] I don't know what have those mother and daughters given you
[06:00] cry
[06:03] you will feel light
[06:07] Please Sherry, I don't need your sympathies right now
[06:14] take your anger out
[06:17] You can take out on me
[06:19] yes
[06:21] because this happened because of you
[06:24] what has my life become
[06:27] I didn't deserve this
[06:32] father isn't talking to me
[06:35] where would I go?
[06:38] I accept that I made a mistake
[06:42] and I kept apologizing to you
[06:44] what do I do now?
[06:46] shall I cut my head and put in your feet?
[06:48] do one thing, just leave
[06:50] otherwise I'll leave
[06:52] and will go to police station
[06:53] to report an FIR against you
[06:55] in case of betrayal
[06:58] fine!
[07:00] go!
[07:01] do this too
[07:04] what did you get by doing this to me?
[07:09] father is too upset
[07:11] I never thought he'd be this upset
[07:16] why don't you stop thinking about your selfish family?
[07:20] they don't care about you
[07:22] not once they asked how are you and in what condition are you?
[07:28] what's the use of this wealth?
[07:30] that children can't use
[07:34] I do agree that children make mistakes, but this doesn't mean that they disown their children
[07:40] your father is selfish
[07:43] where will he take this much wealth? In grave?
[07:46] Just shut up!
[07:49] I left my house because you brainwashed me
[07:53] still you are saying this all?
[07:56] Shame on you, Sherry
[07:58] You should be ashamed
[08:02] listen, I sympathize to you
[08:05] don't consider me an enemy
[08:08] I do agree that you don't love me
[08:11] fine!
[08:13] but don't hate this much
[08:15] that I won't be able to tolerate it
[08:19] this is true that I lied to you
[08:22] I kept cheating to hide my status
[08:26] but ..
[08:27] I swear to my late mother, that I truly love you
[08:32] and until I'm alive
[08:35] I will keep telling you that
[08:39] and do you want to know what can I do?
[08:42] do you want to know?
[08:44] you want to know ..
[08:45] what are you doing Sherry?
[08:45] leave me ..
[08:47] Leave it, are you gone mad?
[08:50] what do I say?
[09:20] Thank you Faizan!
[09:22] for what?
[09:24] to spend such a good time with me. And that necklace ..
[09:28] you shouldn't have spent money. I didn't need it
[09:33] honestly, if I could
[09:35] I would have got you all the jewelry
[09:39] but ..
[09:41] I don't have this much money right now
[09:43] but I promise, very soon
[09:44] I'll do what you'll ask
[09:50] I have another surprise for you
[09:55] ask?
[09:56] what?
[09:57] I'll take you to Hyderabad this weekend
[09:59] really?
[10:01] will you come along?
[10:02] ofcourse, it my plan. I'll go along
[10:04] do you have any objection?
[10:06] not at all. I am too happy
[10:10] You always complaint that I don't take you along
[10:13] so I thought to do so
[10:16] and you'd be happy too
[10:18] Faizan, you have no idea how happy mother and father would be listening to me. I'll message mother and inform her
[10:23] okay!
[10:25] we'll do one thing
[10:26] we'll leave on Friday
[10:28] I'll drop you there
[10:30] do let me know when you have to come back, then I'll send the driver
[10:34] what is the need of staying there? I'll come back with you
[10:37] you are going after long. You should stay
[10:40] you never went to stay after wedding
[10:42] your parents might thing that I don't permit you
[10:45] they don't think that way
[10:47] but if you are insisting too much, then I'll stay
[10:51] wonderful!
[10:55] Hadia, keep smiling
[10:58] you don't look good when you are sad
[11:42] no, I enjoyed a lot
[11:48] I'll go to friend's place to get notes
[11:50] I might get late
[11:52] don't wait. Go to sleep
[11:55] Fine!
[11:55] Take care and come soon
[11:58] what if I don't come?
[11:59] what do you mean?
[12:02] I'm kidding. 
[12:03] Go! Take care
[12:07] Take care! Bye
[12:09] Bye!
[12:55] Speak up?
[12:58] I wanted to talk something important
[13:02] I'm not doing anything
[13:07] all I want to say
[13:09] is to keep an eye on Faizan
[13:12] its not good to trust blindly
[13:16] look, someone who can betray his parents
[13:18] how can he be loyal to you?
[13:21] he isn't cheating
[13:23] He had a girl in his life, who isn't there now
[13:26] hmm
[13:27] are you certain?
[13:29] He swore upon in front of me
[13:31] I do trust that
[13:35] that husband and wife's relationship is based on trust
[13:40] hmm!
[13:43] I wish its true
[13:46] I just want to see you happy
[13:53] also ..
[13:55] mother was telling me that an expensive necklace was stolen from your cupboard?
[14:02] yes ..
[14:03] some servant might ..
[14:05] no!
[14:07] no servant does it
[14:10] what do you want to say?
[14:11] say it openly
[14:13] you might not like it but ..
[14:20] Hadia, only Faizan could do this
[14:23] no one else can do it
[14:26] he can't do it at all
[14:28] how dare you to say this?
[14:30] I know Faizan more than you
[14:33] I am familiar with his actions
[14:36] and he hasn't done this before
[14:39] he's a thief since childhood
[14:43] he has already sold auntie's jewelry many times before
[14:47] look
[14:48] I won't listen to any other word
[14:50] Hadia, I'm amazed
[14:53] you have no doubt on Faizan?
[14:56] So much has happened. Why didn't you tell anything to uncle?
[15:00] why did you hide?
[15:02] Such expensive thing is stolen from house. You should have told uncle
[15:06] this is our personal matter
[15:08] you don't need to get involved
[15:10] you are right
[15:13] but I ..
[15:15] I'm saying it for your betterment
[15:18] I have no other purpose
[15:20] if you think that you would brainwash me against me by talking like this, then this won't happen
[15:27] Faizan is changing
[15:29] and I'm the reason
[15:31] My patience has forced him to change
[15:36] whom are you talking?
[15:51] I was talking to Fizza
[15:52] This Fizza ..
[15:54] She has made you crazy
[15:56] she talks to you for 24 hrs
[15:59] God knows how and why she keeps brainwashing you against Faizan. 
[16:02] she is the one who talks against Faizan
[16:06] No, there is nothing like that
[16:08] enough!
[16:09] I can see and hear everything
[16:12] as soon as she arrived Karachi
[16:13] she has started flying
[16:16] keep less contact with her
[16:18] these girls
[16:19] don't let their sisters live peacefully
[16:24] where is Faizan?
[16:25] I saw him ..
[16:27] dropping you outside home and left
[16:30] he went to his friend's place
[16:32] is everything okay?
[16:33] he took you out for the first time
[16:37] he took me for dinner and shopping
[16:40] oh!
[16:42] shopping?
[16:45] how did he get this change?
[16:47] anyways ..
[16:49] what shopping?
[16:54] he got me 2 and 4 dresses. Nothing else
[18:26] Faizy, you are leaving too early
[18:29] its only 2 a.m.
[18:32] I'm getting calls again and again
[18:34] then make an excuse
[18:36] tell her that you are with some friend
[18:39] or your friend had an accident
[18:41] she isn't a child
[18:43] that she'll believe every time I'll make an excuse
[18:47] If I won't reach in time
[18:48] She will wake father up and then there will be drama
[18:51] Faizy, I planned this party and did all the arrangements only for you
[18:56] and you are leaving?
[18:58] its not fair
[18:59] and you do this always
[19:01] you ditch me for her
[19:03] because she cares about me
[19:11] she gets worried
[19:26] what happened? Why did Faizy leave?
[19:28] he's a coward
[19:29] he's a slave of his wife
[19:31] no go behind him quickly
[19:32] he can't drive
[20:19] Faizan?
[20:21] What did you do? You came drunk home again?
[20:24] Don't argue
[20:28] I'm sleepy
[20:29] how did you come alone in this condition?
[20:34] A friend dropped me
[20:38] you made a promise
[20:40] that you'd leave this all
[20:42] you broke the promise
[20:51] don't tell father
[20:56] on one condition
[21:00] you will leave these bad habits forever and won't do again
[21:14] promise
[21:16] I won't
[21:19] I promise
[21:20] I won't do it again
[21:22] I won't
[21:23] I won't do it again
[22:25] I don't want to talk about Natasha
[22:29] The way she has ruined my dignity
[22:32] I can't forget it
[22:35] Its fine that she has decided to go to court against me
[22:39] I too
[22:41] will answer her in court
[22:43] look
[22:44] forget Natasha's mistake for once
[22:48] and think that she's your daughter
[22:50] she's your own blood
[22:53] Children make mistake
[22:55] and parents have to forgive those mistakes
[22:59] Safdar ..
[23:00] for me
[23:02] for once, forgive Natasha
[23:04] after that
[23:05] you won't get a chance to complaint
[23:08] she will do what you would want. She will get married to whom you want
[23:13] Please, for once ..
[23:14] take this decision back
[23:17] its too late now
[23:21] I wanted her to get married to Raazi
[23:25] but she had no interest in Raazi
[23:29] if she had listened to me, everything would have been fine
[23:33] and ..
[23:35] our dignity wasn't ruined
[23:42] its too late, please!
[24:02] Yes mother, I and Faizan both are coming to you
[24:05] I don't believe it
[24:07] Faizan got ready to come with you?
[24:10] Faizan has changed a lot, mother
[24:12] he takes good care of me
[24:16] I think, God has heard me
[24:18] and faizan's attitude is changed 
[24:21] listen?
[24:22] I have talked to Fizza. I'm bringing her too. She has taken leaves
[24:26] That's great
[24:29] Both my daughters are coming back home
[24:31] my house will be full again
[24:34] I will wait eagerly for you both
[24:37] Faizan is too happy too
[24:38] He wants to meet you both
[24:41] May God keep you both happy, always
[24:44] Amen!
[24:47] Okay ..
[24:48] how's sister Sheena
[24:50] and brother Safdar?
[24:51] its been ages that we haven't talked
[24:54] Aleem wanted to call yesterday
[24:56] tell me?
[24:59] What do I tell, mother
[25:01] father is too worried
[25:04] he ..
[25:05] has decided to disown Natasha
[25:08] why?
[25:44] Khadija?
[25:46] why aren't you having breakfast?
[25:50] what is it?
[25:52] since last few days I can see that you
[25:54] look worried
[25:56] yes!
[25:58] I'm worried about Hadia
[26:02] about her?
[26:07] She is happy at her home
[26:11] Hadia was telling
[26:13] brother Safdar has disowned Natasha
[26:17] disowned Natasha?
[26:20] hey ..
[26:21] what has she done that ..
[26:23] Safdar took this extreme step?
[26:27] she did love marriage
[26:30] she hasn't done something wrong
[26:34] I don't understand that he disowned her on this little issue?
[26:39] it isn't a little thing
[26:41] she ..
[26:42] ran away from home
[26:44] and did court marriage to a rowdy guy
[26:47] and you know brother Safdar's anger
[26:51] yes, I know Safdar
[26:54] but still ..
[26:55] being so strict with children
[26:58] isn't good
[27:02] I will talk to Safdar
[27:05] not to brother Safdar
[27:07] someone should talk to sister Sheena
[27:10] she has spoiled her children
[27:13] she didn't teach them manners
[27:18] Hadia was telling
[27:19] brother Safdar wanted her to get married to Raazi
[27:23] but Natasha didn't like him
[27:27] its her foolishness
[27:30] She couldn't get a better guy than Raazi
[27:39] leave it
[27:40] shall I give you a good news?
[27:42] sure?
[27:44] Hadia called
[27:46] she was saying that she and Faizan will come on lunch tomorrow
[27:50] Mr. Faizan is also coming?
[27:51] hmm
[27:53] yes!
[27:54] and ..
[27:55] they'll bring Fizza along
[27:57] then you have to make good lunch arrangements
[28:00] after wedding, our son in law
[28:02] is coming to our place for the first time
[28:06] I have started preparations
[28:10] do you know ..
[28:12] after wedding, for the first time I felt that Hadia is too happy
[28:15] Thanks to God
[28:17] thanks to God!
[28:18] now have breakfast
[28:23] yes
[28:37] Faizan?
[28:42] Faizan?
[28:47] Get up!

[28:51] I don't have to go to university
[28:53] you are forgetting
[28:55] you made a promise to me yesterday
[29:01] I remember
[29:07] I have to listen to you
[29:09] no, one more promise
[29:17] what?
[29:19] you have to take me to my parents today
[29:25] Ofcourse, I remember
[29:27] We will definitely go. We will go today
[29:32] Then get ready quickly. Lets have breakfast. We also have to take permission from your parents
[29:41] for what?
[29:44] I don't take permission. We'll go and I'll inform
[29:49] yes ..
[29:50] father would be happy 
[29:54] but I think ..
[29:55] auntie would be upset
[29:59] Let them be upset
[30:02] its not your problem
[30:04] and don't get scared. I'm with you
[30:09] we ..
[30:10] are individuals. Both of us ..
[30:12] can take our decisions on our own
[30:14] we'll do what we want to
[30:17] yeah?
[30:20] Give me 10 or 15 minutes. I'll go and change
[30:49] what is it, son?
[30:52] how are you awake this early?
[30:55] He made a promise ..
[30:57] He will wake up early and have breakfast with us
[31:00] wow!
[31:02] well done!
[31:04] Can you see Sheena?
[31:05] your son is on right track
[31:08] tell me more?
[31:09] how are you studies going?
[31:11] they are going fine, father
[31:13] I had an off so I thought to take Hadia to Hyderabad to her house
[31:18] We'll leave in some time. I'll come back in evening and she'll stay for few days
[31:21] I don't want to stay but he's insisting
[31:25] then go my child if he's insisting
[31:28] girls are very happy when they go to their parent's house
[31:31] they are different girls, sister
[31:34] as far as our daughter in law is concerned
[31:37] she is very sensible
[31:41] which house is hers ..
[31:44] she knows it well
[31:49] I ..
[31:50] really like this thing about her
[31:54] Shall I give you tea?
[31:57] no!
[31:59] My child, you are going to Hyderabad for the first time. Don't go empty hands
[32:06] Raazi, my child ..
[32:08] few sweets and fruits cartons
[32:11] put them in car, my child
[32:16] what's the need?
[32:18] auntie is right, it isn't needed. Father won't like it
[32:25] my child, these are the ways of decent families
[32:29] do what I'm telling you, Raazi my child
[32:34] umm
[32:35] I think that ..
[32:37] he doesn't know the route very well. Raazi my child, you go with him
[32:43] This way, you'll go there too
[32:47] and they'll reach there easily
[32:49] yes!
[32:51] umm
[32:52] This isn't needed. We'll go with driver
[32:55] and father will show Faizan the lands himself
[32:58] Infact, I'll show him my school too
[33:00] will you see my school?
[33:04] as you wish
[33:19] umm
[33:21] I have pressed kurta and shalwar for you

[33:28] I?
[33:29] no!
[33:30] I can't wear that. Sorry!
[33:33] Haven't you ever worn it?
[33:36] No, I have never
[33:38] I don't have it
[33:40] you have it. Father gave you many Shalwar Kameez as wedding gifts
[33:44] you never wore them
[33:46] father would like it if you'll wear them today
[33:53] Hadia, I won't be able to carry it
[33:55] I'll look stupid
[33:57] you'll look great
[33:59] wear it for me for once
[34:01] you'll look handsome
[34:03] okay! If you say so
[34:06] I will
[34:08] I was thinking to wear that gold necklace that you gifted me
[34:15] no, you leave it
[34:17] you wear it on some event
[34:19] on some wedding
[34:20] or reception

[34:38] okay!
[34:40] thank you!
[34:47] what is it?
[34:48] you look so happy?
[34:50] I think Faizan is taking good care of you
[34:54] he's taking you to shopping
[34:56] he's taking you to dinners, and now ..
[34:58] he's taking you to Hyderabad too?
[35:02] He took you to shopping
[35:04] you didn't show me?
[35:08] umm
[35:09] I'll show you 
[35:11] leave it
[35:13] go and bring juice first
[35:23] what is it?
[35:25] that you are showing so much love for that girl?
[35:28] you are buying her expensive gifts?
[35:32] why are you acting like typical mother in laws?
[35:35] she is my wife. Either I keep her happy or sad
[35:38] its up to me whatever way I keep her
[35:40] the girl yo didn't like till yesterday
[35:43] today ..
[35:44] you are getting her expensive things?
[35:47] you are doing expensive dinners and going out?
[35:50] also ..
[35:52] how did you think about taking her to Hyderabad?
[35:56] what is your problem?
[35:59] that I took her for shopping?
[36:01] or taking her to Hyderabad or treating her well?
[36:03] what's your problem?
[36:07] I know you very well
[36:09] you won't do favor to your own father without something in return
[36:13] what is it?
[36:19] and this gold necklace?
[36:21] why did you get her?
[36:26] its not gold
[36:27] its gold plated. I gave her only to make her happy
[36:31] you can make a fool to Hadia
[36:33] not me
[36:35] there is nothing
[36:37] wait
[36:38] I'll show it to you. You'd be satisfied
[37:02] are you satisfied?
[37:07] why are you doing it?
[37:08] why are you doubting me?
[37:14] because I know you really well
[37:19] I'm doing it because you asked so
[37:22] you suggested me to get married to Hadia so that father would be happy
[37:25] and I don't think he'd be happy only by getting married
[37:28] I have to keep her happy
[37:30] then only father would be happy
[37:32] otherwise, he'd kick me out of house like he did to Natasha. I don't want that
[37:36] I'm not an emotional fool like your daughter. I'd do everything with complete planning
[37:41] not just like that
[37:43] so let me do what I'm doing
[37:45] please, don't interfere next time
[37:53] thank you!
[37:58] congrats
[37:59] its beautiful
[38:01] umm
[38:02] I was about to show it to you
[38:04] but Faizan ..
[38:07] take care of this
[38:10] situation isn't good
[38:26] I'll go and change
[38:28] hmm
