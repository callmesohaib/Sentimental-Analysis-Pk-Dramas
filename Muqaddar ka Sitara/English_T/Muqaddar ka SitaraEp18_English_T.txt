[01:36] I was thinking of going to Karachi on my way back from school.
[01:41] Fizza asked for some things for her home. I'll give those to her and I'll also meet brother Safdar.
[01:51] You can meet brother Safdar at work. It doesn't seem nice going to our daughter's house so frequently.
[01:57] That is my friend's house first and then it is Hadia's in-laws.
[02:02] Who can it be?
[02:05] Look who it is... it's Safdar.
[02:08] God has blessed him with a long life
[02:11] Greetings... we were just mentioning you. Is everything alright?
[02:19] How's Hadia?
Everything is fine and Hadia is well too.
[02:25] It would be great if you could visit me this week...
[02:31] and I have to talk about something important as well. We'll discuss that as well.
[02:34] Coincidentally, I'm coming to Karachi today.
[02:40] Your niece, Fizza, has got admission into a medical college.
[02:46] I have to go visit him at the hostel.
Congratulations! Why are you telling me this good news just now?
[02:52] Hadia didn't mention it to me as well.
I asked her not to tell you, as I wanted to surprise you.
[03:00] I knew that you would be very happy to hear that.
[03:05] Do you remember that Fizza promised that she would become a doctor and manage your charitable hospital?
[03:12] Soon your wish and your desire would come true.
[03:17] By God's good grace, she will be this family's first girl to become a doctor.
[03:23] Alright then, we'll see each other today.
If God is willing.
[03:28] Safdar, what is the matter? You sound worried.
[03:45] Everything must be alright.
I know... but he did sound worried to me.
[03:52] Lord knows what it is...
[03:59] Listen, there is only a week left before Nisar's departure.
[04:03] I wanted him to get engaged before he left.
[04:07] I'm in no rush. It's just, she's a great girl and I don't want us to lose her.
[04:13] And Nisar likes her as well.
I did mention it to Safdar.
[04:19] But, he didn't respond at all. On the contrary, I felt as though he got upset.
[04:25] I told you that she was interested in Nisar for his daughter.
[04:31] For that, you should talk to brother Aleem directly.
[04:35] No, that's not appropriate right now. Safdar said that he would talk to them today and tell us.
[04:46] Call and remind him then. He might have forgotten about it.
[04:51] Alright, I'll call him.
[05:03] Hello.... greetings. How are you, Safdar? Did I disturb you?
No...
[05:11] Why have you called me?
I just wanted to remind you of the thing we talked about.
[05:15] Don't worry, I've invited brother Aleem this evening to talk about this.
[05:21] That is very good. Why don't we visit you as well? This way we can talk face-to-face.
[05:27] No, but...
[05:31] Uncle... the warehouse at Clifton has caught fire, we have to leave immediately!
[05:36] What?
Yes, please!
[05:46] Hello... 
[05:49] Hello...
What is the matter? Is everything alright?
[05:53] I don't know, I think he hung up, or the line got disconnected.
[05:58] What did he say?
He has invited brother Aleem in the evening.
[06:06] That's very good. Be sure to get ready. Before leaving, call sister Shina, because Safdar seemed busy to me.
[06:16] She should know why we're visiting them.
[06:20] That is true, I'll call her right now.
Get ready.
[06:37] Greetings sister, how are you? I'm fine, how's brother?
We're fine as well.
[06:46] We were just talking to brother Safdar, but I think he's very busy with some meetings.
[06:51] I'm sure he must have told you that we were coming to your house and he must also have told you why we were coming there.
[06:58] This evening... sure, most welcome. This is your house as well.
Alright, we'll see you.
[07:04] Okay, farewell.
[07:11] Thank God...
Good.
[07:16] That means that things will get finalized.
[07:21] Safdar didn't tell me and asked them to bring a proposal.
[07:28] I'll tell Natasha.
[07:31] Get me the plates, so that I may take this out. The cake is baking, and we'll serve the kebabs, hot.
[07:41] Alright.
[07:46] What is happening here? Are you guys talking, or working?
Everything is ready. I've taken out the crockery. We'll serve it when they arrive
[07:55] Go and check the drawing room, everything must be set. Farwa, go with Najma and set up the new teapot.
[08:04] Come on Najma.
[08:07] Serve this properly.
Sure.
[08:16] No... I think you should talk to her. That's not how it's supposed to be.
[08:24] Natasha...
Wait, I'm gonna call you back, it's my mother...
[08:30] Yup?
Why haven't you changed yet? They'll be here any moment now.
[08:35] There is so much time till they get here. Why should I get ready so early, that too in kurta and shalwar!
[08:41] You know I feel suffocated getting ready so early.
[08:45] Don't say anything like that in front of them. We need to leave a good impression.
[08:53] Alright mother, tell father.... that I won't bring a trolley.
[09:02] We have servants to do that.
[09:05] I feel scared when you say such things. I don't want you to lose such a good proposal.
[09:11] Yeah right... I've become a burden to you two, right? You guys are in such a rush.
[09:18] Don't talk nonsense. Get up and get ready.
[09:21] I'll get ready...
[09:25] Don't talk nonsense... get up...
[09:33] Greetings father.
Greetings to you too.... bless you, my dear.
[09:37] I'm fine, how are you? Please have a seat.
[09:42] Why are you here so out of the blue? Is everything alright?
[09:43] Yes, everything is well... I came here to visit Fizza at her hostel...
[09:49] I thought of meeting you as well...
It's good you came here.
[09:54] I don't see Safdar anywhere, is he not home yet?
[09:57] Father will be here any moment today. Some people are coming today to see Natasha.
[10:03] That's very good. May God bless her fate.
[10:08] Amen... did you have something with your father?
[10:12] Yes, Safdar wanted to talk about something important...
[10:18] and that I should come here. I thought that this was a good opportunity to meet you.
[10:34] Farwa... who are you taking this for?
[10:37] I'm taking this to uncle Aleem, he's sitting in the drawing room.
[10:41] Why is here here, and why did you seat him in the drawing room? You know my special guests are coming.
[10:48] Yes... sister Hadia...
Tell her that if she wants to meet her father, take her to her room.
[10:53] I don't want anyone to sit in front of my guests.
[10:58] Go... lord knows where Safdar is.
[11:01] I've been calling him, and he's not picking up.
[11:05] Call Razi and ask him to put Safdar on the phone.
[11:08] Sure, shall I take this, and then I'll call him.
[11:15] Lord knows where Safdar is, he knows that guests are coming.
[11:23] Shina... listen...
[11:27] Razi just called that its bad news...
[11:32] There was a fire at the warehouse in Clifton.
What?
[11:36] Such a great loss...
Thank God that Safdar and the kids are safe.
[11:43] The fire brigade reached there on time and they were able to control the fire.
[11:48] Razi said that they would be late.
[12:06] Father, you should have brought mother with you...
I would have...
[12:10] Greetings* Bless you, my dear. How are you?
I'm well, how are you?
[12:15] Thank God.
[12:17] Sister...
[12:20] Aunt Shina is asking you to take uncle to your room because she's expecting some guests.
[12:35] Sure... let's wait upstairs...
[12:40] I'll meet Safdar when he comes back.
[12:45] Come...
[12:51] Greetings* How are you?
Very well.
[12:55] How are you, brother?
I'm well. I can't see Safdar anywhere.
[12:59] He is actually at the office right now. Something urgent came up, he'll be here any moment now.
[13:04] He was very excited to hear about you guys.
[13:08] Shall we?
Let's go.
[13:10] I'll take this there.
[13:12] Come on.
Thank you.
[13:15] Come in...
[13:18] Mr. Aleem, we're lucky that you're here.
[13:23] How's your wife?
She's well.
[13:25] Did she not come with you?
[13:27] No... I had some things to discuss with Safdar, that's why I came alone.
[13:33] Brother Safdar knew we were coming, but he still hasn't reached.
[13:39] Why are you guys standing? Please sit.
[13:41] Come on...
Farwa, come to the kitchen with me.
[13:57] It's good you're here, otherwise, I would have to come to Hyderabad to meet you.
[14:03] We will need to come o Hyderabad, to meet my sister-in-law.
[14:06] We met her at the wedding, she's an elegant woman.
[14:10] Look how well she has raised both of her daughters.
[14:16] Fizza has gotten admission to a university, right?
[14:20] Yes... all thanks to God.
[14:24] What is the matter, Shina? Brother Safdar hasn't arrived yet.
[14:28] He's on his way. Please take some cake, Natasha baked it.
[14:38] What need was there to go through this trouble? This is our home.
[14:43] Natasha is here. Come and sit with my dear.
[14:51] Last time I wasn't able to meet you properly. And Faizan hasn't met us since his wedding.
[14:58] What can we do? He's going to the office daily, helping Safdar out with the business.
[15:03] We don't see him all day.
That's very good.
[15:08] A son is his father's right hand. Safdar is lucky to have a capable and hard-working son.
[15:15] All credit goes to you.
[15:18] Safdar must stay busy with work... you are the one who raised your children.
[15:25] You're right... Shina has raised his son well, whilst living in the US.
[15:31] That's why brother Aleem has him as his daughter.
[15:38] It is our wish as well...
[15:42] that a girl like Hadia become the light of our house as well.
[15:57] I'm sure Safdar told you why we came here.
[16:02] Yes...
We should have talked about this at their home in Hyderabad.
[16:08] But first I wanted your and Safdar's approval. If you guys don't have any objections, then we would like to bring a formal proposal to your home.
[16:24] I don't understand...
Brother Aleem...
[16:31] we're here to ask for your younger daughter, Fizza's hand in marriage for our son Nisar.
[16:45] Don't answer me right now. You can think about it. We will bring a formal proposal to your home.
[17:13] Thank you so much for this respect but...
[17:21] I can't...
[17:26] answer you without discussing it with Safdar.
[17:30] I don't think Safdar would have any objections, but I wanted to know your opinion.
[17:36] But I... without taking my wife's opinion...
[17:42] Father... Fizza is still studying and she wants to become a doctor...
[17:50] My dear, we have no objections to her studying. We can wait for a few days.
[17:55] And if she wants to study, she can go to the US with Nisar and continue studying there.
[18:01] You guys know that Nisar likes educated and confident girls.
[18:07] And... he is the one who expressed his desire to marry Fizza.
[18:13] We are in no rush. You guys can think about it.
[18:17] I think we should get going now...
[18:22] Alright...
[18:57] Mr. Aleem, we're here to ask for your youngest daughter, Fizza's hand...
[19:01] in marriage for our son Nisar.
[19:20] Did you see it? This is the result we get for joining relationships with those poor people! They have shown their true face!
[19:29] Natasha I...
What mom!?
[19:33] I don't deserve all this. I was embarrassed in my home!
[19:39] I will never be able to forget this!
[19:42] Alright... just relax...
Just what!
[19:47] How dare they come to our house and bring a proposal for that girl!
[19:55] And you kept watching! Why didn't you shove them out?
[20:00] Natasha, they are still sitting downstairs.
Oust that girl and her father from this house.
[20:06] I won't tolerate them here. They will remember what I'll do to them for the rest of their lives!
[20:15] Throw them out!
How can I? Safdar invited them.
[20:22] You can't do anything, right? They came here for me, then how come did they choose that girl?
[20:30] Your daughter-in-law must have done something. They must have plotted something.
[20:37] Your father did all of this... this is all his fault.
[20:43] I won't tolerate this at all. Tell the father to cancel this relationship
[20:51] They insulted me in my home and you did nothing.
[20:57] Hadia must be so happy right now. Will Fizza try to compete with me, Natasha Kamal!?
[21:06] I will not let her get away with this. I will strangle her if she comes in front of me!
[21:11] Relax... why are you going crazy?
How can I relax?
[21:18] Why did you do this to me? Why did you show me dreams of becoming Nisar's wife?
[21:25] How could you do this to me? What does she have that I don't? Is she more beautiful than me?
[21:33] How did they see her and not me? It would have been better if I hadn't come to Pakistan. I'm not livestock!
[21:42] From now on you will look for no proposals for me. It would have been better if I hadn't come to Pakistan.
[22:35] My dear, don't worry.
[22:40] I will not let this relationship be at all costs.
[22:43] I will call them tomorrow and excuse myself.
[22:49] My dear, I can't ruin one daughter's home, just to marry the other one.
[22:57] Don't worry about me, it is such a good proposal for Fizza. It's hard to find such a good proposal.
[23:05] Turning away from such a proposal is going against the will of God.
[23:09] Try talking to your father.
[23:13] My dear, what are you saying?
[23:17] Should I marry my daughter to a place, where Safdar wanted to marry his daughter?
[23:24] If I do this, he will stop trusting me.
[23:28] And... besides, sister Shina, will make your life difficult in this house.
[23:36] She will never tolerate this embarrassment.
Time heals everything.
[23:43] I'm just asking you to not be hasty. Think long and hard before taking any decision.
[23:52] Alright, my dear, I'll do that.
[23:57] Take care of yourself. I'll get going.
Farewell*
[24:19] Well-done.
[24:22] Good going. You have succeeded in your plan.
[24:27] Pardon?
Don't act... you wanted Nisar to get married to your sister, right?
[24:35] Speak... you knew very well that we were interested in Nisar for Natasha.
[24:41] That's why you invited your father here on purpose and told them directly.
[24:48] Is this how you are? How dare you turn a proposal coming your sister-in-law's way to your sister.
[24:55] It's nothing like that. I can't even think of doing that.
Forget it.
[25:01] I know sly and sharp women like you very well.
[25:06] You're not how you appear to be.
[25:11] You can make a fool out of Safdar, but not me.
[25:15] Your entire family has put a veil over Safdar's eyes and now you want to make a fool out of them.
[25:24] Tell your father to refuse this proposal immediately.
[25:31] Otherwise, it won't be good for me. Faizan's cold behavior towards you...
[25:37] will turn permanent. I'm telling the truth, I didn't know that they were interested in Fizza.
[25:45] Father didn't know as well. He came here because uncle Safdar invited him here. He wanted to meet him.
[25:50] What is going on? I can't hear the voices coming outside.
[25:55] You're very late today.
There was a fire in one portion of the factory.
[26:00] We've endured a loss of millions.
[26:04] We endured a loss here as well
[26:09] What loss?
It's good you're late.
[26:13] You saved yourself from being embarrassed in front of everyone, like me.
[26:17] Shina, stop speaking in riddles.
[26:20] My dear Hadia tell me...
Your friend, Mr. Rehman came here.
[26:25] With his wife.
[26:27] He came here with a proposal for her capable and educated sister.
[27:43] My daughter doesn't deserve all this, Safdar!
[27:46] Ask them, why they did this to us.
[27:51] What are you saying?
[27:55] As a father, it won't look nice if I ask them why they rejected my daughter, to choose another girl.
[28:01] You will have to ask them why they gave us hope.
[28:07] If they wanted to send a proposal to them, why did they embarrass us here?
[28:16] Is your friend...
[28:19] your enemy? Did your friend do this on purpose to embarrass you?
[28:26] Is that friend of yours a snake in the garden?
[28:30] What are you saying? What's gotten into you? Why are you thinking so negatively?
[28:35] It's not their fault, it's mine. I'm the one who made a mistake.
[28:40] Brother Rehman called me and he told me that he's interested in their daughter, Fizza.
[28:48] I was the one who forgot to tell you.
[28:51] You knew all this!
[28:54] Yes... I didn't tell you because I feared you might get hyper. Which you are being right now.
[28:59] You didn't do good by hiding this. If you hadn't done this, my daughter wouldn't have been embarrassed.
[29:08] You're right.
[29:11] I should have told you. I'm sorry.
[29:15] It was my fault. But what would I have done? Brother Rehman called me...
[29:22] But before I could talk to him, the warehouse caught fire, and I went there. I was the one who called brother Aleem here.
[29:29] Why do you get upset at him for no reason? Listen to me...
[29:35] Couples are made in heaven. So what if they chose their daughter, instead of ours? All daughters are the same.
[29:43] Our children...
[29:46] Look how we've raised them. Then there are their children. Look how good their daughter is...
[29:52] You see all the badness in the world in our children!
[29:56] What happiness have our children given us?
[29:59] For God's sake.
[30:02] Shina, listen to me...
[30:06] This marriage won't happen because I know brother Aleem very well...
[30:11] She won't marry his sister at a place, where we wanted to marry our daughter.
[30:18] Don't be under that illusion... if they were so aware...
[30:22] they wouldn't have come here today.
[30:25] Please... enough. I won't hear one more word. You will have to listen to Mr. Safdar.
[30:31] Because all of your relatives and friends are so greedy that...
[30:38] I feel ashamed to introduce them to anyone.
[30:42] And you've given them too much slack. Enough is enough...
[30:48] What will they think about us? My daughter's respect has been compromised.
[30:54] And I hold you responsible for it... I will never forgive you for my daughter's disrespect.
[31:02] Shina listen to me...
[31:39] You must be very happy today...
[31:42] Happy that they rejected my sister and chose your sister.
[31:47] How come you always think so negatively about me?
[31:53] Even though you don't think of me as your family, I do.
[32:00] Natasha is like a sister to me.
[32:06] Whatever happens, happens for the best. God must have something good planned for him.
[32:10] As far as Fizza is concerned, she has just started her MBBS. Father won't marry her right away.
[32:18] And he surely won't marry her at a place where uncle was interested in Natasha.
[32:24] You know what... you can act innocent in front of your father, not in front of me. Don't try to make a fool out of me!
[32:31] I'm not making a fool out of you. I'm just trying to make you understand that neither I nor my father knew about what happened today.
[32:42] Then why did your father come here? Especially when such important guests were supposed to arrive.
[32:48] You could have refused, but you didn't. Do you know why?
[32:53] Because you want your sister to get married into a big home, like you!
It's nothing like that.
[33:00] Don't lie, I know your planning. Don't you get tired of lying?
[33:05] Enough Faizan, don't put such a vile allegation on me!
[33:11] Don't test my patience so much that I tell uncle about the things that I've hidden up till now.
[33:33] What will you tell him?
[33:35] Going to meet Ramsha, using the business meeting as a cover. Talking to her over the phone all night...
[33:42] sending her expensive gifts worth millions and coming home intoxicated every day.
[33:50] I had been tolerating how you've been treating me up till now, but I can't tolerate it anymore.
[34:10] Do you think I'll get scared of these threats?
[34:16] Cowards give threats...
[34:18] I'm not a coward, I've been silent up till now...
[34:23] only because of the respect and peace of this house.
[34:29] Don't think of my silence as my weakness.
[34:34] I'm trying to maintain your honor and you're getting upset at me...
[34:41] Remember one thing Faizan... when I open up my mouth...
[34:46] then it will be very bad for you.
[35:25] Thank you.
[35:35] What are you thinking about? There is nothing to think about, refuse the proposal.
[35:41] Don't give anyone hope.
[35:44] They will feel very bad. They will think that we didn't even take time to think.
[35:51] Besides, it's not good to reject such a good proposal without thinking about it.
[35:59] I don't care what they think. Think about the daughter that is in that house.
[36:04] Sister Shina must have told her off by now...
[36:08] And do you think brother must have liked it?
[36:15] Why would they want our daughter to get married into a wealthy family?
[36:20] He was so silent when he heard that Fizza had been accepted into a medical university...
[36:25] May God save my daughter from harm.
[36:33] You're right.
[36:36] But I don't know why, but it seems to be that if this marriage happens, Fizza would be happy there.
[36:45] It's hard to find such people.
[36:49] You thought this for Hadia as well, and what happened?
Thank God she's happy in her home.
[36:57] I understand that there is a lot of lacking in Shina and Faizan...
[37:03] The rest is fine. As far as Mr. Rehman is concerned he is very different from them.
[37:11] It's hard to find such honorable people.
[37:37] Hello... greetings...
[37:40] Is this Fizza Aleem speaking?
[37:44] Yes... who are you?
My name is Nisar Ahmed...
[37:48] My father and your uncle Safdar are old friends.
[37:53] I'm sure you understand by now.
[37:57] Yes... where did you get my number from?
[37:59] Your sister Hadia. I insisted upon it...
[38:04] Sister did? But...
[38:07] My parents send my proposal to your home, for marriage.
[38:11] Which your father rejected without any reason. I wanted to know...
[38:18] Look... if my parents have rejected it, then there must be some reason behind it...
[38:25] I have no problem with it...
That's fine...
[38:29] I wanted to know your opinion.
[38:32] When my parents have refused, I have no problem with it. Why are you insisting upon it?
[38:38] You've never seen me or met me...
[38:41] I saw you at Faizan's reception... I was the one who asked my parents to take a proposal to you...
[38:48] If you're refusing because it's an issue of your studies...
[38:54] then that's not a problem, I'll wait. I too want...
[38:59] to be married to someone related to the medical field. This way both of our fields will be the same.
[39:06] I have no shortage of girls, but me and my parents took a liking to you as soon as we saw you.
[39:13] And I decided that if I will marry anyone, then that will be you.
[39:34] Fizza... I don't understand this topic. Could you help me out?
[39:41] Sure, which one is it?
