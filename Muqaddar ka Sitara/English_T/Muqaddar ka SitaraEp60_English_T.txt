[01:08] I didn't believe it before
[01:11] you know it Fizza
[01:13] yes
[01:14] but you tell me, it won't matter
[01:20] I had an objection of father breaking the engagement. I argued a lot too
[01:26] what else could I do? He is my father
[01:29] and I couldn't say further
[01:34] Put yourself in my shoes and think. What if your father had taken a decision against me?
[01:39] then what would have you done?
[01:44] I fought a lot for you, and also wanted to meet you
[01:49] but neither you agreed, nor father
[01:54] now you tell me, what could I do? I only had one option
[01:58] to go back to US forever and not return back
[02:04] this was a big punishment for parents who had only one son
[02:10] and only for you, I did this too
[02:15] Nisar, my father has passed away
[02:19] He couldn't tolerate constant blames on his daughters and left us
[02:27] now you tell me, as an obedient daughter
[02:39] you are right ..
[02:41] your loss is huge
[02:44] and it can't be paid off
[02:46] we can only send peace to uncle's sould. I believe if his daughters would be able to make their house again ..
[02:54] then it can be possible
[03:01] I won't do the engagement now. I will marry you directly
[03:15] I will wait for your decision
[03:58] how much I used to warn you
[04:01] about Ramsha. But you didn't hear anything I said
[04:05] after this disgusting girl
[04:08] you have given us a huge loss. Do you even know it?
[04:11] Look at your sister. What has happened to her because of that Raazi
[04:16] your friends?
[04:18] I never liked your friends
[04:21] I had always warned you not to be friends with them
[04:25] you trusted that disgusting Zohaib who is a fraud
[04:29] and gave your father a loss of millions
[04:32] how could you be so stupid, Faizan?
[04:35] and you?
[04:41] Have  you always supported him?
[04:45] Have you always thought for his benefit?
[04:54] Why are you taunting me about my sister?
[04:58] you never liked Raazi then why are you blaming me?
[05:04] and why would I only consider Natasha's condition? Why not my own?
[05:10] My life is ruined too. You kicked my wife out of this house
[05:18] Hadia ..
[05:25] too much injustice happened to her
[05:28] too much injustice
[05:34] I accept that all my decisions of life were wrong but I took those decisions because you asked me
[05:44] I had never met Raazi. I hated because you asked me
[05:49] I couldn't give space to Hadia in my heart just because of you.
[05:52] Faizan?
[05:53] Enough!
[05:59] as far as hurting father is concerned
[06:06] I accept, I did it
[06:10] I accept that I hurt him and never listened to him
[06:16] but what did you do?
[06:18] You spent his wealth with both your hands. To ruin Fizza's reputation you gave away 1 million rupees
[06:28] its pointless now
[06:35] its too late
[06:40] everything is finished.
[07:42] Faizan?
[09:48] Safdar? Please forgive me
[09:59] I know that ..
[10:03] I made a huge mistake
[10:09] but I'm ready to correct my mistake
[10:16] I'll apologize to Fizza
[10:20] and ..
[10:22] I'm ready to hold her feet and apologize
[10:29] I will apologize to Hadia too
[10:36] you ..
[10:38] you take me to them, please
[10:43] Trust me, Safdar
[10:56] Trust?
[11:07] You don't deserve it
[11:18] I trusted you everytime
[11:26] about me
[11:28] about my children
[11:32] in return
[11:35] everytime
[11:37] you have broken my trust
[11:44] and now ..
[11:47] in hatred of Hadia and Raazi
[11:51] you have crossed all the limits and have ruined your own children happiness
[12:02] look
[12:05] look at her condition
[12:12] you are to blame for this
[12:17] I'm ready to apologize to Raazi as well
[12:24] I know that he will forgive me. He's too good
[12:29] He will forgive me .. please
[12:31] There is no doubt in it that he's such a good person. I also know that he'd forgive you too
[12:42] but using kindness of others for your own benefit ..
[12:47] it would be unfair too, Sheena
[12:52] its of no use now
[12:56] he's leaving
[12:58] Forever, he's not just leaving the city
[13:06] but the country too
[13:09] you .. you stop him
[13:12] take me to him. I'll apologize
[13:16] I will apologize for all my sins and mistake. Please take me to him
[13:23] I'll apologize
[13:26] its too late
[13:27] its late
[13:30] in your ego
[13:32] and your hatred, you have crossed every limit
[13:36] you didn't care about those pious girls as well
[13:42] you have ruined our relationship too
[13:48] if possible, you and your son should bow down ..
[13:54] and ask for apology from God
[13:58] May be, He'd forgive you
[15:31] You are continuously taking care of me, and aren't sleeping. You'll get tired
[15:37] You don't get tired serving your own people
[15:41] I want to look after you my whole life
[15:45] You won't go on a walk without me now
[15:50] Do you really love me this much?
[15:54] Is there any doubt?
[18:43] Hadia, I was calling you
[18:47] you didn't pick
[18:48] and that's fine, why would you?
[18:58] so ..
[19:00] I wanted to apologize
[19:07] Do you know, something is happening
[19:12] I feel like I'm breaking from inside. I don't understand what to do?
[19:19] I did wrong
[19:29] too wrong. If possible ..
[19:35] forgive me, I'm really sorry
[20:06] no!
[20:10] I will never forgive
[20:14] I could forgive all the sins
[20:18] but when you character assassinated
[20:22] I can't forgive it ever. Do not wait for me to return back
[20:29] I have burned all the boats
[20:32] I won't come back
[20:41] Was it brother Faizan calling? What was he saying?
[20:46] He was apologizing
[21:03] I can never forgive
[21:08] I could forgive all the sins but when you character assassinated, I can't forgive it ever. Do not wait for me to return. I have burned all the boats I won't come back
[22:03] Have you forgiven him?
[22:06] Do you think I could forgive what he did?
[22:19] He has no connection with my life now
[22:24] This is why do not mention him next time
[22:31] the person who has gone from my life
[22:37] I don't care about his apology
[22:45] I have told mother
[22:51] as soon as possible
[22:54] send them divorce papers
[23:38] its of no use now
[23:41] he's leaving
[23:44] forever. No only he's leaving this city but
[23:50] he's leaving the country
[23:53] Mother and father would never bring Raazi back
[23:57] I'd have to talk to Raazi myself
[24:03] no .. phone
[24:07] I'll go to Raazi's house
[24:10] and convince him
[24:12] I'll convince auntie too
[24:15] It wasn't my fault in this all
[24:20] I never thought wrong about Raazi
[24:23] I love him a lot
[24:29] I should convince Raazi and apologize
[24:35] I believe that he'll accept me
[24:39] I can't live without him
[25:10] don't you think Fizza, that it wasn't right to reject Nissar?
[25:16] He was the only one standing with you when everyone was blaming you
[25:28] Sister, you all
[25:29] Fizza, everyone claim that they love, but the one who supports you in difficult time
[25:36] he loves you truly
[25:42] and it isn't sensibleness to reject such people. Its thanklessness
[25:52] condition of our house is in front of you
[25:57] father has left
[26:00] I'm alone
[26:05] In this all..
[26:08] you have two examples, one Faizan and one Nissar
[26:17] if you can't really differentiate between good and bad
[26:21] then you can't reject Nissar
[26:24] but now ..
[26:25] nothing has happened now. He called you 6 times. If you'll call him one time, it won't hurt you
[26:34] Call him
[27:14] You Fraud .. you disgusting man
[27:17] I want my money back
[27:20] This is why I called you
[27:22] otherwise, a buyer doesn't care after the deal
[27:26] Saliq, you have to return every penny of mine or else I'll deal with you badly
[27:32] You don't need to do anything. But yes, speak properly
[27:38] then I can talk to you about work
[27:44] Speak up
[27:45] Ramsha and Zohaib not only betrayed you but me too
[27:53] betrayed?
[27:55] you?
[27:59] how dare them
[28:03] anyways, I'm happy what your father did to them. Both are behind bars now
[28:12] anyways, you do one thing. Go to Ramsha's house
[28:16] There is a bag of mine
[28:18] you send that bag to me
[28:22] one minute, what are you saying?
[28:26] I'm in Dubai right now. But I do have a known person in Karachi
[28:31] He has his flight after an hour. You send that bag to him
[28:38] and I promise, as soon as I'd get my bad, I'll transfer your money to you
[28:45] and also the factory
[28:47] but why would I trust you? You have already cheated me
[28:54] My dear Faizan, you have no other option left but to trust me
[29:05] and you are the only person who can send my bag to me
[29:12] you save me from loss, I'll save you
[29:17] How can this be possible. I don't know where did she keep her bag?
[29:22] Look, you'll find it when you'll search for it. If you'll keep questioning
[29:31] then 2 hrs will be passed. And if I won't get my bag, then you can also forget your money and factory
[29:45] fine
[29:47] stay in contact
[29:49] okay!
[30:26] Natasha, where are you going?
[30:29] mother, I'm going to convince Raazi. I know that he'll forgive me
[30:35] you aren't going anywhere. You aren't well. You aren't allowed driving
[30:41] mother, please let me go
[30:44] He will leave the country and go, and will never come back
[30:49] Natasha listen to me?
[30:52] Faizan?
[30:53] For God's sake, stop her. She is going after Faizan
[30:57] I have something important
[30:59] Please, her life is under risk. She is not allowed to drive
[31:02] This is my last chance to convince father. I really have to go
[31:55] Natasha ..
[31:57] from now, you will stay with me here forever
[32:09] Natasha?
[32:29] How many times have I stopped you not to allow her to go out of home like this? You know her mental condition really well
[32:37] I tried hard to stop her but she didn't listen. She left
[32:43] You do one thing, call Raazi and ask if she has reached or not
[32:47] I will call Raazi. Where is Faizan
[32:51] I don't know. He left in emergency. He was saying its something important
[32:58] Its Natasha calling
[33:01] My child, where are you? I have been calling you since long .. you ..
[33:06] accident?
[33:09] what are you saying?
[33:12] Safdar?
[33:14] He was saying that Natasha had an accident?
[33:16] what?
[33:28] Natasha? Natasha?
[33:32] how did this happen?
[33:33] Let us do our work please. Don't worry and pray
[34:46] Who is this speaking?
[34:47] This is Saliq speaking. Tell me, is Faizan there?
[34:52] We have nothing to do with Faizan now. He has ruined my daughter's life. Police has arrested Ramsha as well with Zohaib. And this all happened because of you.
[35:06] Listen to me carefully, bail my daughter out in two days. Otherwise, it won't be good for you
[35:15] I will tell the truth to Safdar Kamal
[35:18] I promise, I will bail out Ramsha soon
[35:24] You do one thing. Faizan will be there very soon. There is a bad in Ramsha's room. Give that bag to Faizan. Also, keep one thing in mind. There is no need to question Faizan
[35:43] What's in it?
[35:45] Don't question a lot. Do what I asked you
[35:51] and I promise that Ramsha will be bailed out soon and will be with you
[36:26] you?
[36:29] You ruined my daughter's life
[36:33] I ruined her life?
[36:35] you both ruined me. She wasn't loyal to me. Neither she became mine nor let Hadia be mine. It's me who is being punished
[36:44] No, your are being punished for your cowardliness
[36:51] a man who couldn't decide who to stay with 
[36:56] should be punished like this
[37:02] Go inside, and pick whatever you want to. And listen, do not show me your face ever
