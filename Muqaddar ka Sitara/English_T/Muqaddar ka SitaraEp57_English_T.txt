[01:11] Razi... he hit me a lot.
Was this the only thing that was left?
[01:25] I'm doing this all because of you. It's because I love you.
[01:32] And... I want to become the girl that you want me to become.
[02:27] So much happened, you should have at least called to let us know.
I didn't know what to do.
[02:36] No one helped me. No one believed me. Even Faizan asked me to leave.
[02:44] Why did you leave with him? Didn't you know how your husband was?
I made a mistake.
[02:52] I made a mistake in understanding things.
[03:00] My dear, you aren't the one who made the mistake, we are the ones who made the mistake
[03:07] We handed you over to brother Safdar.
[03:17] Razi...
[03:21] My dear, how can I thank you?
[03:26] You brought me, my daughter. You protected her and took care of her.
[03:33] Whatever I said to you, please forgive me for that.
[03:40] No auntie, what are you saying?
[03:45] This was my duty. I did you no favors.
[03:51] I only did this out of kindness.
[03:57] It was Faizan's duty as well.
[04:03] To protect her.
[04:09] He didn't stand by his duty. But you did.
[04:20] Auntie, don't worry. Everything will be alright. I'll go and meet the doctor.
[04:31] How's father now?
He'll be fine.
[04:40] Where's father?
[05:39] Why Hadia?
[05:43] Why? Why did you betray me like this?
[05:52] Why? Why?
[05:57] Why? Hadia, why?!
[06:13] I didn't expect this from you.
[06:19] I was a fool. I was a fool!
[06:27] I was a fool.
[07:18] If only I had proposed to you before Faizan.
[07:22] If I had, then this wouldn't have happened.
[07:31] If I had you would have been mine instead of Faizan's.
[07:38] I lost a diamond like you.
[08:08] Even if I find a magic lamp, I still won't be able to find a girl like you.
[09:24] Hello?
Where are you?
[09:26] Where are you?
[09:28] I'm in the car, I'm coming to you.
Weren't you supposed to rest today?
[09:34] You went to that party with Hadia as well. Tell me, how was that party? I'm sure you must not have enjoyed yourself without me.
[09:43] I won't go anywhere without you anymore.
[09:49] You'll be with me... and I'll be with you. I'll declare our marriage. I'll tell the whole world about us.
[09:58] I'll bring you home.
What about Hadia?
[10:03] Hadia's chapter is now closed.
[10:07] What does that mean?
I've decided to remove her from my life.
[10:13] I don't want anyone to be between us. I want to be yours and stay with you.
[10:19] I want us to live together and spend our life together. Think of that as done.
[10:25] No one is between us anymore, nor will there be anyone.
[10:29] Faizan, I'm so happy. I can't tell you how happy I am to hear this.
[10:34] Hurry up and come to me. I'm waiting for you.
[10:38] I'm coming.
Okay bye.
[10:55] Ramsha... what game are you playing? On one hand, you planning to steal Faizan's wealth with Zohaib.
[11:04] And on the other hand, you're calling him to you. What do you want, to stay with him, or loot his wealth and run off to Dubai?
[11:14] I'm considering both options. Because of the wealth Salek gave us, I don't think we can spend the rest of our lives with it.
[11:24] I was thinking that we should live in Safdar Kamal's home. Faizi has now agreed to take me with him.
[11:31] What if Safdar Kamal doesn't accept you as his daughter-in-law?
If he doesn't accept me...
[11:40] then we will run off with the money. Even if I leave Faizan, I won't be at a loss.
[11:47] Until then I'll be able to steal enough money to spend the rest of our life comfortably. What's there to lose in me considering my options?
[12:00] I don't understand it. You're playing a dangerous game.
[12:30] Pray for your father's health.
[12:38] What happened brother Razi? What are the doctors saying? Is father alright?
[12:44] Tell me.
[12:48] I will not give you all false hope.
[12:53] Uncle Aleem is still in critical condition.
[13:00] He's on a ventilator.
[13:04] He has grown weak and because of it, the doctors cannot do surgery.
[13:15] But they are trying.
[13:19] To tell you the truth, right now, only your prayers can save uncle Aleem.
[13:30] I'll go and meet the doctor.
Brother Razi...
[13:35] Call uncle Safdar, ask him to come here and...
[13:40] free him from this pain. If he comes here and drives away his misunderstandings...
[13:47] Then father will be freed from this pain. Call uncle Safdar to bring his son here and make him take back his allegations.
[13:58] What are you saying?
I'm right mother,
[14:04] I think uncle Safdar should come here and apologize to him. He should take back the allegations. There is not much time left.
[14:15] There is no need to be a witness to Hadia's character.
[14:22] Not one of us doubts her purity and her character.
[14:31] Both of you are your father's pride.
[14:44] If someone didn't cherish you two, then that is their loss.
[14:49] But father...
[14:55] Hadia...
[14:58] He's not in that state because of shame. He's not that weak.
[15:13] He...
[15:16] Pain..
[15:19] has broken him down.
[15:23] This pain was given to him by his closest friend.
[15:28] Who he trusted and believed. He thought of him as his brother.
[15:40] I will never forgive brother Safdar.
[15:46] I will never forgive him.
[16:40] Father, I'm innocent. I did nothing.
[16:46] I can swear on the Quran, I didn't do this. You know I'm not like this.
[16:54] All of these are allegations. There weren't any signals over there. On our way back our car broke down.
[17:04] Then there were thieves, who stole our phones, and then...
Enough Hadia... how much more will you lie?
[17:39] Please pick up the phone!
[18:47] Natasha... soup...
[19:19] Natasha... my dear...
[19:30] I cannot...
[19:36] see you like this.
[19:43] Natasha, please try and understand...
[19:47] It's not like you've lost everything.
[19:53] He was never worthy of you.
[19:57] Why don't you understand that?
[20:02] You deserve much better.
[20:13] My dear, look...
[20:20] Come back to life. If you close yourself in your room like this...
[20:27] what will you achieve?
[20:34] Talk to me... share with me.
[20:43] Speak about the pain that is in your heart.
[20:50] But please come out of this.
[21:01] Natasha, look at me...
[21:13] Natasha, please.
[21:33] Be sure to have your soup.
[22:48] Good morning.*
[22:51] Your breakfast is ready.
Not now, I have to go.
[22:57] Faizi please, don't go now.
[23:01] Father called. Natasha is not well... she's upset, I have to go.
Faizan, why don't you understand?
[23:08] These short meetings do not fulfill my heart. I want to spend time with you.
[23:15] Why don't you leave everyone and come to me? Or, why don't you take me with you?
[23:22] Hadia is not in our way as well.
[23:26] That day is near. Please wait.
[23:30] Alright... but please don't go now. My heart sinks when I hear that you're leaving.
[23:42] Don't worry. Soon I'll be back and take you away from here.
[23:48] Promise?
[23:51] Promise.
[23:54] I'll wait for you.
[25:47] Razi... my dear how's brother Aleem now?
He's not well.
[25:54] The doctor said he won't be able to survive more than two days.
[25:59] The condition is very critical.
May God have mercy. How can this happen?
[26:06] That is my suspicion...
Your suspicion was correct.
[26:13] The last person uncle Aleem talked to was aunt Shina.
[26:19] After that, he had a heart attack.
What has she done? She has ruined their life and her hereafter.
[26:28] What kind of careless and cold woman is she?
Pray that a miracle happens.
[26:38] Pray that uncle Aleem is saved.
Tell me, how is Hadia?
[26:44] She's very upset. She holds her responsible for the entire situation.
What happened to her was bad.
[26:54] May God create ease for her. Amen.
[26:59] Amen...
My dear, take good care of yourself and everyone there.
[27:04] Keep me updated on uncle Aleem's health.
[27:09] Sure mother.
Farewell*
[27:13] God, please have mercy. Poor brother Aleem...
[27:48] How dare you call me? Did you feel no shame in calling me?
Faizan I didn't call to argue with you.
[27:56] I want to talk to my uncle. I want to tell him something important because uncle Aleem is in the hospital.
[28:05] He's in a lot of pain. He had a heart attack.
[28:12] Alright... so? What should I do?
Don't do anything.
[28:18] Just inform uncle about it. Ask him to come here, meet him, and talk to him.
[28:25] It's possible that if he apologizes, uncle Aleem might get better.
[28:31] Faizan please, I request you...
[28:36] please bring your uncle here to the hospital with you. Try apologizing and see what happens...
[28:47] Faizan... apologize and take Hadia with you.
[28:53] Everything will get better if you apologize. Everything will be forgotten. I promise that...
[29:02] I won't ever interfere in your life.
Didn't you take a lot of time in saying that?
[29:08] You should have done that earlier. It's an open field for you now.
[29:13] I will divorce Hadia, then you can marry her. That's what you wanted right?
[29:18] And what should I apologize for? I wasn't the one who made the mistake, it was you.
[29:25] You should be the one to apologize, not me.
[30:08] Brother Aleem is awake and his condition is stable now.
[30:14] Thank God...
He was asking for Hadia as soon as he woke up.
[30:18] Who is that?
It's me, I'm his daughter.
[30:21] You can meet him.
Thank you, doctor.
[30:31] Hadia my dear... forgive me. 
[30:40] I wasn't able to make the correct decisions for your life.
[30:47] I trusted my childhood friend and handed him the most precious thing I had.
[30:59] Forgive me, my dear. The one responsible for ruining your life...
[31:08] is me. Only me.
[31:14] I thought that with time Faizan will change.
[31:22] But... he turned about to be characterless.
[31:27] But... he's not the one to blame.
[31:33] Safdar is the one to blame for this. He was my friend.
[31:40] He kept lying to me.
[31:47] I will never forgive him.
[31:56] You won't ever forgive him as well. Promise me...
[32:02] that you will not go back to that house.
[32:08] And you will never forgive them. 
[32:17] Father, I'll do as you say. I will not hand my child over to that characterless man. I will do as you say. I just want you to get better.
[32:29] Hurry up and get better. I have no complaints against you. Father...
[32:39] Father...
[32:44] Father...
[32:47] Father... doctor...
[33:04] Father, wake up. Talk to me, father.
[33:23] Father... I can't let you go like this.
[33:27] You can't leave me like this.
[33:31] I will not let you go.
[33:37] Father, wake up.
[33:41] Father, please talk to me. I want to talk to you.
[33:46] Father, wake up.
[33:54] Father...
[34:11] Mother...
[34:13] I can't see father anywhere. He wasn't at work as well. Where is he?
[34:18] Your father-in-law has died. He's gone there.
[34:24] What?
[34:32] When and how?
[34:34] I don't know. Some relative called and told him. Your wife and mother-in-law didn't have the decency to tell us themselves,
[34:42] Your father is there and there is no reason for you to go there.
I should offer my condolences.
[34:49] For God's sake Faizan, you have no relationship with Hadia anymore.
[34:53] Please understand that.
Her father had a heart attack after witnessing what Hadia did.
[35:01] How much grief will we face? One should have some self-respect. End whatever relationship you have with her. Send her divorce papers.
[35:10] I will marry you and Natasha into wealthy families.
[35:17] For Natasha, you'll have to find a man from a good family. But don't worry about me.
[35:24] Why, what does that mean?
[35:29] I've already married Ramsha.
[35:36] Are you insane? What nonsense is this? We just got rid of Hadia and now you're after Ramsha.
[35:45] I don't believe you, Faizan. I will not bring her to this house as my daughter-in-law.
[35:52] Look at me! Do you understand me, or not?
[35:57] She has become your daughter-in-law and she is also expecting.
[36:02] What nonsense is this? I don't believe you, Faizan. I won't let her step a foot inside this house. If your father finds out, he'll kill you.
[36:13] Do whatever you want. I have married her and she has become your daughter-in-law.
[36:19] She's going to be a mother soon, so you'll have to accept her. I did marry someone you guys chose before...
[36:25] and look how it turned out to be.
This won't turn out good as well. Your father knows her.
[36:34] I have to make a call.
[36:40] Hello Ramsha... guess what? I've told everyone about us at home.
[36:50] Get ready... very soon you'll be at Safdar Kamal's home.
[37:14] This was bound to happen. I had waited for this day for a long time. Now...
[37:21] I'll see how you'll stop me from coming to your home, Safdar Kamal.
[37:42] Auntie... please...
[37:46] Father...
Wait, brother Safdar...
[37:56] I cannot allow you to touch his casket.
[38:14] No...
[38:16] Don't take away my father...
[38:20] Father...
In the name of the Lord!
[38:25] In the name of the Lord!
Stop them...
[38:32] Father... father...
[38:42] Fizza, they are taking away father.
[38:46] Father...
[38:53] You can go back home.
[39:03] You have no association with this home anymore.
[39:09] Your friend is gone.
[39:15] And you've already ousted your daughter-in-law.
[39:22] Go away from here!
