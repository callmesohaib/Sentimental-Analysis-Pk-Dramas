[04:24] what to tell you, I've become so busy
[04:27] don't say this, all of us do business but we meet frequently
[04:32] you are right
[04:33] brother Safder, we can't see Faizan. Where is he?
[04:37] Faizan just went inside after offering prayers
[04:40] Okay
[04:41] Ok, my wife must be waiting for me. See you guys later
[04:44] OK brother Safder, do visit us with your wife'
[04:46] God willing
[05:06] Hadia

[05:10] dear, is everything prepared? the guests must be on their way
[05:13] yes, everything is ready. I've kept the cutlery in the drawing room
[05:16] I will send piping hot tea when dad's guests will arrive
[05:19] very nice! stay blessed, may God keep you always happy
[05:24] let me go & check everything
[05:27] where is Faizan & Natasha?
[05:31] you know they don't wake up early
[05:36] Sheena, at least wake the up early for today
[05:41] and what are you wearing?
[05:46] at least wear some traditional dress for today, what's with you!
[05:50] its fine, you know I feel so uncomfortable in those clothes
[05:56] the limit!
[05:58] ok tell me, would you like to have coffee or cereal? what would you like to have in breakfast?
[06:02] what do you mean? even today we will have the routine breakfast?
[06:05] I mean, you haven't prepared any sweet dish?
[06:12] come on Safder, who eats such a heavy breakfast nowadays?
[06:16] by the way, those days were different Sheena when we used to go to offer prayers in the mosque & upon coming back the women used to serve us delicious food
[06:28] all of that tradition is not there anymore
[06:32] the time has changes but you haven't
[06:34] and I don't want to change
[06:36] its a different matter that I've spent my entire life in America, but it doesn't mean that I shall forget my manners & culture
[06:44] OK leave it, let me do the routine breakfast
[06:46] please go & wake them up for today
[06:52] how shall I wake them up & to whom?
[06:54] you know Natasha doesn't wake up before 12 pm
[06:57] and Faizan wasn't at home the entire night
[07:01] what! and you are telling me this right now?
[07:06] dad, you are eating the sweet dish so quietly. Didn't you like it?
[07:11] dear, what are you saying? Is it possible that my daughter cooks something & I don't like it
[07:18] then why you haven't taken more?
[07:20] dear, if I will keep on eating this sweet dish then who will eat these dates sweets?
[07:26] and they will get finish by the evening
[07:30] hmm... don't talk much. Give me the eidi as I've done my breakfast
[07:34] you've done your breakfast?
[07:37] your breakfast must be done, but I am still doing
[07:40] pass me the dates sweets
[07:43] No, you cannot eat them
[07:46] why so?
[07:47] because the way he was praising sister after eating the sweet dish
[07:51] the same way he will eat dates sweet & say that nobody can make dates sweets like my Hadia
[07:58] true that, because Hadia cooks very tasty things
[08:02] but look, don't be upset. We are joking with you
[08:06] we eat the mince prepared by you, then?
[08:12] yes but... nobody talks like my Fizza does
[08:18] dad, today is Eid. And if I got upset today, then you have to bear the consequences of it. So just think
[08:24] here you go, your eidi
[08:26] yes dad, give it to her. Otherwise, her fines will keep on increasing
[08:31] don't worry, I cannot compete your eidi even if I add the fine
[08:37] bad habit
[08:39] and dear, this is for you
[08:42] thank you dad
[08:44] thank you so much...
[09:12] what is this happening? what are you doing inside the kitchen?
[09:16] just a while ago you had breakfast with me. So for whom you are making coffee?
[09:20] has somebody come?
[09:22] it must be Shakila's aunt for sure, as she likes coffee so much. Right?
[09:26] nobody has come, mom. Your greedy relatives will come on lunch
[09:29] today is Eid's day, anyone can come at any time
[09:32] oh mom! the coffee will become cold in this argument
[09:36] Ok tell me who has come for whom you are making coffee
[09:39] for Faizi
[09:41] he is sleeping in the guestroom
[09:43] what! Faizi! Last night Faizi had stayed at our house?
[09:46] talk slowly mom, he will listen
[09:49] last night he came with me because of his father
[09:52] why he came here? tell me!
[09:56] whom I had brought before him?
[09:57] today is Eid's day, anyone can come anytime. What will we do?
[10:01] if Faizi goes out of the house & somebody from the neighborhood saw him then they will gossip around
[10:06] mom, then say it that he is our relative & he came to meet us on the Eid day
[10:10] oh my God.. what to do with you? Its very difficult to explain you
[10:16] mom, you know how important he is for us
[10:20] he is a millionaire & you are talking like this for him?
[10:24] Ramsha, I was just saying..
[10:28] mom listen to me, I know how to handle every situation
[10:34] don't worry yourself for these trivial matters, nor worry me
[10:39] and before the time this coffee becomes cold coffee, move!
[10:44] I was just.. 
[11:57] hello!
[12:00] hello!
[12:02] who is it?
[12:04] I'm Ramsha speaking, Faizi's friend
[12:09] where is Faizan?
[12:11] uncle, he is sleeping. I've been trying to wake him up since so long
[12:17] what!
[12:25] what happen? is everything alright?
[12:28] do you have an idea, that where was your son the entire night?
[12:33] where?
[12:34] he had spent the entire night in some stranger woman's house
[12:38] oh! you got me scared. What's the big deal in it?
[12:42] it means, its not a big deal for you?
[12:44] your son spend the entire night in some stranger woman's apartment & its not a big deal for you!
[12:49] he will come back as soon as he gets up.  Just relax
[12:52] now I understood
[12:55] the mothers like you do the wrong upbringing of their children
[12:58] then we have to see such days
[13:00] earlier he was wasting the money on his friends, and now on this girl!
[13:04] dad, we cannot do all those things in order to make you happy that we don't want to do
[13:09] please leave us alone!
[13:12] we cannot adjust as per the environment here
[13:16] we came to Pakistan because you had insisted, what else do you want?
[13:22] mom, send my breakfast to my room
[13:27] this is what you call an Eid?
[13:35] Hadia, everything was so delicious. Everyone was praising it
[13:40] why not? after all my daughter is so nice
[13:46] I remember, let me call Safder to say Eid Mubarak
[13:51] you always remember him
[13:53] but brother & his wife never thinks about us
[13:56] it was different when he was in America, but now its been a year that he moved back
[14:02] and its not difficult for them to come to Hyderabad from Karachi
[14:06] Khadija, how many times I've told you not to keep any grudge for anyone in your heart
[14:13] and then you know Safder, how nice person he is
[14:18] Besides, he had constructed a school here for poor children
[14:23] there are a lot more rich people, except for him
[14:25] who didn't bothered to make a small mosque over here
[14:30] you are right but
[14:33] nobody is as rich as brother Safder in this area
[14:36] may God bless him with more
[14:39] but this is true that which ever thing brother touches, becomes gold
[14:43] yes, dad was telling me that when he had gone to America 25 years ago. He just had 3 lacs in his pocket
[14:49] and that too he took a loan from dad
[14:52] and now he have is own restaurants & plaza in Karachi
[14:55] dear, all of this is the result of his hard work. He is such a hard working & self made person
[15:04] and the truth is that he isn't proud at all even though he is a very big businessman
[15:11] he is still the same
[15:13] and do you know, as soon as he became independent he returned my loan
[15:20] what I would have done if he wouldn't have returned it?
dad
[15:23] yes dear
[15:23] its Safder uncle's call from Karachi
[15:26] see, I had told you that he will call
[15:30] I'm coming
[15:38] so tell me, how is your wife?
[15:42] pay my regards to her
[15:45] I miss your daughters, how are they?
[15:48] how old they are?
[15:49] everyone is fine. Hadia has completed her graduation
[15:55] and the younger one is doing F.Sc in medical
[15:59] she is saying that she will become a doctor, & will make a hospital where she will treat the patients free of cost
[16:06] may God give her success
[16:08] tell her to let me know as soon as she becomes a doctor
[16:12] this is my promise to her that I will make a hospital for her
[16:16] what was your elder daughter's name?
[16:20] Hadia! yes...
[16:23]  what is she doing after graduation?
[16:25] she is teaching. Also she helps me to run the school with me, which you had made
[16:32] may God bless you, you've done such a great job by making that school here
[16:37] no doubt
[16:39] all of this is God's blessing, my brother
[16:42] I serve his humanity because he gave me a chance
[16:45] I want to build a very big mosque & a hospital too
[16:50] that's great! it seems as if you will earn paradise in here
[16:56] actually, it was my deceased father's dream & I want to fulfill it
[17:01] may God gives you success in your plans
[17:04] its been so long that you didn't visited us. Why don't you visit us sometime?
[17:10] oh yes yes! I will definitely come if I will visit Hyderabad
[17:13] in fact, my children loves to meet you
[17:17] do you know
[17:19] often I tell them, whatever I am today & wherever I am standing today
[17:23] its all because of your uncle after God
[17:26] because he had helped me a lot in my bad times
[17:30] Safder, you are making me feel guilty
[18:11] what the hell is he doing?
[18:14] what!
[18:16] Faizi, stop him. He is doing so cheap actions
[18:19] instead of stopping him, you are doing the same thing
[18:22] well we are having fun
[18:25] Faizi, listen to me. Don't bring your friends in our meetings, it disturbs our privacy
[18:32] they are your friends too, we all are common friends. Right?
[18:35] I know Faizi, but earlier it was different
[18:39] now I am your special friend
[18:42] and I like to spend time with you alone
[18:46] punch me this time!
[18:50] stop it!
[19:51] Faizan, please stop the car
[19:55] stop it! please stop the car
[20:12] Mister
[20:13] yes, tell me
[20:15] you have broken a signal
[20:17] So?
[20:18] I have to give you a fine
[20:21] who will fine me? Will you
[20:24] who will fine me?
[20:27] I'm standing in front of you, so I will fine you
[20:31] do you know who am I?
[20:33] it doesn't make any difference
[20:35] whether you are a Prime Minister's son. Duty is duty
[20:42] stay in your limits & sit
[20:47] you stay in your limits & sit in the car, because I am leaving
[20:54]  you cannot run. Wait!
[20:56] Faizi!
[21:02] Sir, all the three samples are in front of you. We just need your approval to upgrade them
[21:07] Ok fine but..
one minute
[21:11] yes?
[21:14] what!
[21:18] make a call to Wasay
[21:22] Ok, send me the file. Let me check it
[21:25] thank you so much!
[21:35] hello!
[21:38] yes Wasay listen
[21:40] go to the police station right away, Faizan is there
[21:44] and solve this issue now
[21:48] right now!
[22:22] audacious
 shameless
[22:26] stop it! what words you are using for your young son
[22:29] have you seen the actions of your young son?
[22:32] is this how a young son is?
[22:34] my manager got them bailed out from the police station
[22:37] to him & to his licentious friends too
[22:40] he has defamed me in the entire city. 
Where are you going? Wait!
[22:44] take him along
[22:46] hey! explain him & take him away
[22:49] otherwise I will push him & oust him from this house. Take him away
[22:53] shameless!
[22:54] do you know, I've built this empire by working day & night
[22:59] but somebody shall take care of it. Such children will handle it? Get out!
[23:06] look at his actions. Have you seen?
[23:12] get lost!
[23:14] go!
[23:23] don't know how God has punished me with such a disobedient children
[23:30] oh God please forgive me
[23:46] Faizan, why don't you leave your licentious friends?
[23:50] as you know that your father doesn't like them
[23:55] my father doesn't like it
[23:59] he had enjoyed his entire young age in America
[24:04] and now he remembered his religion & country in this age
[24:09] he wants to be a good muslim & a patriotic person?
[24:13] tell him that he had brought us here forcefully
[24:16] Faizan, stop it!
[24:19] the thing is that I cannot change
[24:22] accept me whoever I am, and I won't change myself for him
[24:28] and tell him to stop interfering in my personal matters now
[24:34] talk slowly, he will listen!
[24:36] let him listen! I don't care. He should know that he is a very bad father
[24:40] and he had brought me here forcefully
[24:42] both of you have made my life a living hell!
[24:45] I've become fed up of listening to your father's taunt & now the entire family is taunting me for the bad upbringing of both of you
[25:01] brother Safder had called just now
[25:05] he is saying that he will come to Hyderabad
[25:08] his wife will also come?
[25:10] I didn't ask
[25:13] maybe she will also come along
[25:16] his wife never wanted to meet us
[25:18] brother Safder calls us sometimes
[25:22] its been a year that he had shifted to Pakistan
[25:25] by the way, I'm sure that his wife is not happy after migrating here
[25:29] as per her nature, she cannot live in Pakistan
[25:34] for sure, the children must be like of her nature
[25:37] don't know why brother Safder came back
[25:41] he had a very big business over there, right?
[25:43] yes, but sometimes a person makes such decision for the sake of their children future
[25:50] secondly, Safder wants to wed off his kids in his family
[25:57] he is so much into his culture
[26:00] he is so patriotic & he wants his children to love their country in the same manner
[26:08] will he marry his kids here?
[26:10] yes... I think so
[26:14] in fact, he had discussed Hadia so many times
[26:23] what are you saying?
[26:25] we have a very big class difference
[26:29] and how will he convince his wife & kids?
[26:33] our Hadia & his son doesn't have any match
[26:37] Safder is a very nice person
[26:40] I don't deny that, he must be
[26:44] but we don't know anything about his son
[26:48] our Hadia won't be able to adjust there
[26:50] you don't know my daughter
[26:53] she knows how to adjust in all kind of people & environment
[26:58] my daughter is very patient
[27:15] Faizan, come with me. I want to talk to you about something important
[27:17] but I don't want to
[27:18] come!
[27:20] I cannot...
save me!
[27:22] you are on your own
[27:24] what is it?
my mother wants to meet you
[27:27] but I don't want to meet her
[27:31] I'm juts kidding. Why does she want to meet?
[27:34] for our marriage, what else?
[27:37] why are you in a hurry to get married?
[27:39] Faizan, its not me who is in a hurry but she is. She has got so many proposals for me & she is pressurizing me
[27:45] but I've told her clearly that if I will marry then only Faizan, no one else
[27:51] Faizan, are you listening to me?
[27:53] yes
[27:54] I love you so much & I can't imagine my life without you
[28:00] I know
[28:02] and I love you too a lot
[28:06] a lot!
[28:08] but the problem is I am not ready for this commitment. Its a very big responsibility
[28:14] look at me! I am everywhere. Do you think I am ready for marrying?
[28:20] and you don't know my father
[28:23] he is such a dangerous man!
[28:26] you know what is his problem?
 whatever I want
[28:30] he doesn't want to give that to me
[28:32] don't know there is something anti. Like this
[28:38] give me some time, let me convince him. Then we'll see what needs to be done
[28:42] how much more time do you want?
[28:45] I can wait for you as long as you say
[28:49] but please don't make commitment to someone else, except for me
[28:52] if I didn't get you, then I will die
[28:58] we are in a party, why are you talking about dying? Have you gone mad? We will get married
[29:07] live in the present. 
Today is the day, lets have fun
[29:13] lets dance, we will get married
[29:18] where are my drinks?
[29:19] what happen?
[29:20] where are my drinks?
[29:21] what happen?
[29:22] where are the drinks?
Okay come here
[29:35] who is Ramsha? what is it?
[29:40] mom is asking about your girlfriend, with whom you are spending a lot of time nowadays
[29:48] just finish it off. Stop this rubbish!
[29:52] what? why!
[29:53] because I don't like her
[29:56] I've heard a lot about her family, which I don't like
[30:01] Okay, so what is a good family in your eyes?
[30:05] well settled? rich? Stylish or modern?
[30:11] I agree, she isn't that rich. But she is stylish & modern, we look good together. That's it!
[30:18] one's class doesn't change by wearing modern clothes
[30:23] I have heard about her mother that she is a single parent
[30:26] and both the mother daughter duo traps rich guys like you to get money
[30:31] So?
[30:33] I don't care if its true
[30:35] I love her, not her family background. So that's ...
[30:41] correct!
[30:42] I was thinking, none of your girlfriend had stayed with you for more than two weeks
[30:47] and this Ramsha, its been 3 months man! Are you Ok?
[30:53] do you know, mom is tensed what if you get married to her
[30:57] I really don't want to have this conversation with you
[31:00] and relax! I am not marrying, and presently not marrying anyone
[31:04] its just that we share good chemistry, that's all!
[31:08] that's why we are tensed, what if your chemistry matches with that girl & you married her
[31:15] then our family's name will be ruined
[31:20] family's name!
[31:22] No, you don't worry. Presently, I am not marrying anyone
[31:26] the thing is, I don't believe in marriage.. its a life long commitment
[31:34] I don't trust this institution. What's there in getting married?
[31:39] I have no idea! How can people spend their life with a single person?
Its insane!
[31:46] have some shame
[31:50] he is making fun of a sanctified relation like marriage
[31:54] do you know, what is its importance in our religion?
don't teach me religion
[32:00] by opening a charity school in Hyderabad, you think that you are a good muslim?
[32:04] you are a very religious & pious person? 
I mean...
[32:08] what you haven't done in your entire life, how do you expect that from both of us that we will do?
[32:13] and these useless lectures at all times, makes no sense
[32:18] we were brought up in States, we were born there not in Pakistan. Where kids don't have their will, they will only do everything as per their parents consent
[32:24] I mean, its not going to happen now
[32:27] whoever Ramsha is, however she is. I like her
[32:31] I don't care how her family background is. Or how she was in the past
[32:36] I don't care!
[32:42] and genuinely I think our problem is this generational gap
[32:47] you don't talk, you just order
[32:51] the society has moved on, but you are still standing there
[32:59] you think you are modern?
[33:02] yes?
[33:05] you are a stain in the name of modernism
[33:10] this hype in your circle is because of me
[33:15] if I take a stand then you won't be able to complete your studies too. So what are you proud of?
[33:20] tell me!
[33:22] have you seen Mr. Hamdani's family? They have lived in America for their entire life
[33:26] but his kids are still associated to their culture & identity
[33:31] and my kids? what to say!
[33:35] my kids... I feel ashamed while introducing them
[33:40] this is my house. I'm talking to you!
[33:43] here! look at me... only I will order here
[33:49] even we keep respectable pet at home
[33:52] and its very important to know a girl's family background when we take a proposal to her house
[33:58] and you are saying that girl, whose reputation is defamed in the entire city
[34:04] he wants to keep a relation with her? 
What do they think of me?
[34:08] what shall I do!
[34:11] have breakfast
[34:19] at least you have breakfast
[34:21] there is no tissue on the table
[34:23] at least keep the tissue
[34:27] Faizan!
[35:04] God has blessed with a beautiful & healthy son
[35:07] congratulations to you!
[35:10] dad, your grandson is just like you
[35:15] I will do a very good upbringing of my son
[35:19] I will make him a pious & good muslim
[35:22] don't forget your religion & traditions while living in a foreign land
[35:28] and ensure to pronounce Azaan in your son's ear by some good & pious muslim
[35:37] and dear, the way you are a good & pious muslim
[35:42] the same way do the upbringing of your children
[36:11] don't take Faizi's words so seriously
[36:21] I cannot see my children following the wrong path
[36:25] because one day I have to answer my God
[36:29] he is a kid
[36:31] he will fix himself once he will get the responsibilities
[36:36] Sheena, I can tolerate everything but...
[36:39] I cannot tolerate a girl as my daughter in law, who shall destroy my upcoming generation
[36:46] he has already said, that he won't marry her
[36:51] but I don't trust him
[36:54] and if he did any such thing
[36:57] then not just me, but I will disinherit from my wealth & properties
[37:05] you won't so any such thing
[37:07] don't you remember,  he had called child services in America when you had tried to raise your hand on him
[37:13] this is why
[37:16] Sheena, this is the reason I have come here after winding up my everything from that country
[37:21] so that our children shouldn't forget their culture & identity
[37:24] do you have an idea, that what injustice you've done to your kids?
[37:30] those kids were habitual of that environment
[37:32] they feel suffocated here, in this conservative environment
[37:35] I've made an arrangement so that they don't feel suffocated
[37:39] what do you mean?
[37:40] I mean, I've decided to marry them
[37:46] what!
[37:47] yes
[37:48] and Sheena, I hope that you will support me in this decision
[37:52] absolutely not! don't even think that I will support you in such kind of decision
[37:56] first of all you have brought us here forcefully from America after uprooting us. There was a culture shock
[38:01] and now you want marry them forcefully without their consent & permission
[38:07] I cannot support you in this decision. Not at all!
[38:10] I'm their father
[38:12] I know what's good or bad for them better than you
[38:16] this is better for them
listen!
[38:18] I will go to my sister's house tomorrow
[38:23] all of a sudden, why are you discussing your sister?
[38:26] why?
[38:28] she is my elder sister, she has got complete right on me
[38:32] I couldn't visit her since I came here. In fact, you also come along, as its important for you to come with me
[38:38] not just there, but we will visit brother Aleem's house as well
[38:42] its fine to visit your sister's house
[38:46] but brother Aleem? His status doesn't match ours
[38:50] the status that you are talking about, its maintained because of him
[38:53] if he wouldn't have helped us in our bad times, then today we would have been facing bad times
[38:58] and you are also forgetting that you've returned his favor to him doubled
[39:03] Sheena, why do you...
[39:07] the limit!
