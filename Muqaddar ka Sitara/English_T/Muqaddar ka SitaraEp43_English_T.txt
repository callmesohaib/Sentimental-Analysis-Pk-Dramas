[01:02] Come in.
[01:05] Uncle, did you look at this audit report? Fifty to sixty lacs are missing from the Islamabad branch.
[01:18] Sit down.
[01:24] I was worried about this as well...
[01:31] My business is being drained for millions...
[01:36] I know who's doing this and why this is happening.
[01:41] Faizan has crossed his limits and Shina is responsible for that.
[01:47] Her love is making me endure this today...
[01:53] I don't understand a thing. The only thing I can do is monitor the branches in Lahore and Islamabad myself.
[02:07] He has crossed all limits.
[02:12] Uncle, please be strong. Don't worry.
[02:19] I'll inquire about this with the audit team.
[02:25] As far as Faizan is concerned.
[02:28] He's not at home, so how can he come to work?
[02:33] What do you mean?
Maybe you don't know this, but he doesn't stay at home for long.
[02:40] He's stays out all night
[02:44] I saw him returning home in the morning.
[02:48] Uncle, I'm really sorry, I didn't want to complain about him to you...
[02:58] I can't tolerate it anymore.
[03:03] Hadia didn't discuss this with me.
I cannot convince Faizan to come to the office.
[03:12] You'll have to do that yourself.
[03:16] I have a request uncle...
[03:19] After the vile accusations that Faizan put on me, my self-respect doesn't allow me to continue working with him.
[03:30] Please separate me and Faizan.
[03:43] Thank you.
[03:54] I was saddened...
[03:57] to hear about your daughter?
What can I say Khadija, that's how daughters are...
[04:04] They don't want to cause their parents pain by telling them their pain.
I can understand.
[04:10] But she could have shared her pain with you.
She told me about it indirectly.
[04:15] I was the one who couldn't understand. It's our fault, we always taught our daughters...
[04:23] that in-laws are everything. We taught them to stay silent and not answer back.
[04:30] Silence is the cure for everything we said. And we always asked her to be patient.
[04:35] That is what encouraged them and for my daughter's patience...
[04:45] We can only pray for her.
May God save parents from the pain their children endure
[04:51] Amen.
[05:04] Have your tea.
[05:23] I don't understand what's going on with the accounts.
[05:29] Uncle don't worry. Whatever it is, it will open up before us very soon.
[05:37] That is true Razi but... Where are you coming from?
[05:46] What is going on?
[05:50] I don't see you at work or at home. I've not been seeing you at breakfast for two days as well. What's going on?
[05:59] I was with a friend.
[06:07] Friend, or girlfriend?
[06:10] Father...
I understand everything. It's not possible for you to deceive me so easily.
[06:19] Who's deceiving whom, only time will tell you that.
[06:24] But you don't trust me, so it would be better if I stay silent.
[06:44] What was so urgent that you had to stay out all night, last night?
[06:52] This is the first time that I've stayed out. I don't do this every day.
[06:58] Faizan if this is a girl, then end your friendship with her.
[07:05] Is this the same girl you had an affair with?
[07:09] There is no one in my life other than Hadia. Razi lied to defame me in front of you.
[07:19] Stop it. I know everything, You are my son, is this the same girl who took two crores rupees from your father to leave me?
[07:28] She needed the money, you offered her and she took it.
[07:37] This tells me that you are still in contact with her and you must meet her as well.
[07:42] Even after having a wife like Hadia, you're involved with that greedy woman. What are you doing Faizan?
[07:51] I apologized to Hadia because of you. Should I breathe according to you as well?
[07:59] No! Listen to me...if you try contacting her again, you will not forget what I'll do to you.
[08:09] It was my mistake that I married a girl like Hadia to you. The truth is that...
[08:17] you're not worthy of Hadia. I don't have anything to say to you, begone!
[08:36] I'm not worthy of Hadia?
[08:46] I'm not worthy of Hadia...
[09:16] Greetings, how are you? What's going on?
I've been studying since last night for my exams and making notes.
[09:24] That means that you must be very tired. Not so much that I can't talk to you.
[09:30] That's very good. That means you've reached the place you wanted to reach.
[09:36] Almost, in a few months, you'll become my bride and come to my home.
[09:41] What will happen to my studies then?
[09:45] You can complete that here.
[09:47] Really?
Of-course...
[09:50] After our marriage, I will change your routine.
What do you mean?
[09:54] Meaning, how will you give time between university and all the other things that you do?
[09:59] You will need to give me time as well.
Why not? Sure I will.
[10:05] Tell me, did you have lunch?
[10:08] I didn't find the time to do that...
That's no excuse
[10:13] Between work and university, you don't care about your diet at all. Eat something right now, otherwise, I'll get upset with you.
[10:20] Alright, I'm going. Why don't you come as well, we'll have lunch together.
Right now?
[10:27] No, not now. I'm at my sister's home. Father's not here to permit me.
[10:33] So what? Come here with your sister...
[10:37] I can think about this offer of yours, but not today. Have lunch and we can talk some other time.
[10:46] Farewell.
[11:07] Where were you all night, last night?
[11:12] Are the people here only to inquire about me? Father stops and you begin.
[11:17] I'm not inquiring, I'm just asking.
[11:23] You don't seem well to me.
Enough Hadia...
[11:27] Why are you asking? Why do you even care?
Who will care if not me?
[11:34] You don't even know how much I love you.
[11:38] Forget everything that happened.
[11:43] Hadia, don't expect me...
[11:47] to say emotional dialogues and lie to you.
[11:54] You know what?
[11:57] No matter how I am, my heart is clear.
That's good.
[12:03] I don't want you to say something that's not in your heart.
[12:07] How do you do all this? How do you show this false love? I can't do this.
[12:18] Even after staying so near you, I was unable to recognize you.
[12:25] This is not false love.
[12:29] If you still suspect something...
I'm not suspicious...
[12:34] I'm sure.
[13:01] Your son has tied my hands. I don't understand how, after having a loving wife like Hadia...
[13:07] I don't understand how he got into having affairs.
Hadia is at fault as well.
[13:11] She couldn't become as good a wife as you expected her to be.
[13:16] The nerve of you.
[13:20] Your hatred for her hasn't lessened. Stop hating her.
[13:25] Every truthful thing I say is wrong.
You know...
[13:30] I chose Hadia very carefully. I was sure that she would change Faizan.
[13:36] But it was unsuccessful because she didn't try.
No...
[13:42] We lacked in educating him properly.
[13:47] Before blaming her, we should take a good look at ourselves.
[13:54] As parents the mistakes we've made...
[13:59] How can we hand a girl, who just came here, the responsibility of handling our wayward son?
[14:04] My son is not bad as you think he is.
[14:10] Tell me, why did you hire Razi to spy on Faizan?
[14:15] Do you know how angry Faizan will get when he learns of this?
[14:20] Razi and Faizan do not like each other. Razi can do anything to degrade Faizan and become a hero in your eyes.
[14:29] He can even put false allegations about my son.
That is wrong.
[14:35] I know Razi very well, he's not like that at all. As far as your son Faizan is concerned...
[14:41] then he has an old habit of being friends with girls.
[14:46] No matter who this girl is, I will find out about it.
[14:50] Really... what will you gain by finding out? Will you give her money to leave him, like you do every time?
[14:56] How many girls will you pay off?
I will do everything to keep people like that away from him.
[15:03] Faizan is naive and foolish like his sister, Natasha. Girls like that first become friends, and they try to marry.
[15:11] What will we do if he marries someone and brings them here.
He's not a fool who will just marry any girl and bring her here.
[15:19] Really! Do you think your son is very smart?
[15:23] You are misunderstood.
[15:51] What is the matter Khadija? Are you here because you couldn't sleep?
[15:59] No... I woke up...
[16:03] I was thinking about our children.
[16:06] What are you worried about? Tell me...
[16:12] Nothing...
[16:13] Look, my vision isn't that weak that I can't see the tears in your eyes.
[16:22] What happened? Tell me.
[16:27] I was just worried.
[16:35] Ever since sister Shabnam told me about her daughter, I've been worried for Hadia.
[16:44] Look... why are you worried about something that someone else said?
[16:55] I admit that what happened to their daughter was very wrong.
[17:03] I'm sad about that as well.
[17:07] But it's not necessary that happens to our daughter as well.
[17:15] Should I call Hadia?
What are you saying?
[17:21] It's not appropriate to call anyone at this hour. Even if it's your daughter.
[17:30] As far as Hadia is concerned, she will sort out her problems.
[17:38] Besides... it's not good to involve oneself in the matters of a married couple.
[17:48] I don't want anything that we say...
[17:52] to cause a problem in her household matters.
[17:56] Look...
[17:59] I admit that after the wedding Faizan's attitude towards Hadia was not good.
[18:07] He's getting better, believe me.
[18:15] Sometimes parents must understand unsaid things that their children try to say.
[18:22] The silence of parents make their daughters weak.
If it were something like that then Fizza would have told me.
[18:31] Did she call you?
[18:35] If she didn't call you then why are you worried?
[18:43] Stop worrying and come back to sleep.
[18:48] Go ahead, I'll be right there.
[19:13] Faizan, I've ironed your shirt.
Did I ask you to do that?
[19:19] It's such a boring color, take it away.
[19:21] I'll iron a different one, it will only take a few minutes.
Enough Hadia.
[19:26] What is the matter Faizan? I'm only doing this because it's your first day at work.
[19:34] Yes... you want that... you want me to go to work, so that you may have more freedom.
[19:42] Faizan, what's wrong with you?
[19:46] I'm trying so hard for things to get better between us...
[19:52] But I don't understand your upset attitude.
When have you ever understood me?
[19:58] You never even tried to understand me.
[20:06] When you come in front of me, I remember that night...
[20:10] When you and him...
Enough Faizan! It seems that I've been stuck in quicksand!
[20:18] Do you think this house is quicksand?
Not this house, but our relationship.
[20:23] It is shattering because of you. I don't know why there is much poison in you, for me.
[20:34] I don't have time to hear these useless things. Don't come in front of me.
[21:39] You must have understood the rest of the details. Razi is here and he will give you the rest of the details.
[21:49] Good morning*
[21:53] I don't think it's necessary for me to brief you more on this.
Yes sir.
[22:01] Excuse me.
[22:16] Sit down...
[22:27] Why did you come here?
I'll come here daily and I promise that I won't disappoint you.
[22:34] Faizan... there are some rules in this office. Rules that even I follow.
[22:43] It's good that you've realized your mistake and that you want to come here.
[22:51] Like all workers, you need to be punctual. I'll have you instated in the accounts department with Mr. Zafar...
[23:01] I hope you won't disappoint me.
I promise I won't.
[23:14] Call Mr. Zafar...
[24:37] I'm glad I've gotten the opportunity to work in the accounts department with you. I'm sure we will take this company to heights it has never seen before.
[24:47] Thank you so much, Mr. Faizan. But I won't be able to help you like I have in the past.
[24:54] The reason is that Mr. Safdar is handling all the accounting matters directly.
[25:00] And the fraud we two committed for the amount of fifty lacs, Mr. Safdar and Razi are investigating that.
[25:12] Don't worry about that. The amount was in cash and it can't be traced.
[25:21] That's good, but I won't be able to do anything like that again.
What are you saying? I just need a small favor.
[25:31] What is that?
[25:35] I want to oust Razi from here
[25:38] How can I do that?
[25:43] Only you can do that. Do something, make a fraudulent case on him.
[25:48] It's not possible to make a case of fraud on him because Mr. Razi's accounts are clear.
[25:56] He keeps tabs on all his expenses, even the minor ones. So it's impossible to make a case against him.
[26:07] Alright, let's think of something else then.
[26:13] Because I can't tolerate him anymore. Not in this office or at home.
[26:35] Should I come in?
Sure... you don't need to ask.
[26:42] Did you pack for everything?
Yes.
[26:48] Time passed so quickly.
[26:52] I don't want you to go.
Really? I'll stay here for a few more days.
[26:59] No... you have already spend a lot of time away from studying. Go to your hostel and study hard.
[27:05] Sure... if it weren't for the assignment, I would have stayed for two more days.
[27:12] At least I could have taken you to the doctor for a check up.
Why are you worrying?
[27:17] Faizan is here. I'll go with him when he comes back from work.
[27:22] Will brother Faizan go with you?
Yes, why not? He might be upset at me, but he's concerned about his child.
[27:33] I hope your misunderstanding comes true.
[27:39] Anyways... you have to take good care of yourself. You will eat on time and don't stress about anything.
[27:48] Fizza, you've started talking like mother.
[27:53] Mother asked me to tell you all this.
[27:56] Alright... that's why. Mother...
[28:02] I'll ask the driver to bring the car around.
Go ahead, I'll follow you.
[28:07] Did you eat?
Yes I did.
[28:17] Shina, Faizan's routine will get better if God is willing.
[28:24] Otherwise, he used to sleep all day and spend all night outside.
[28:31] Take care that Faizan doesn't leave home after eleven at night.
[28:39] I'm not worried about Faizan, but I am worried for Natasha.
[28:47] It's been three months in his divorce. In a few days her waiting period will end.
[28:56] I just want us to find a good match for her and get her married.
[29:02] I'm worried for her as well.
[29:06] There is no moment that I'm unaware of her.
[29:14] Our daughter is naive. I don't want her to take a wrong decision again.
[29:23] Because, she doesn't recognize how people are.
[29:31] Tell her that we won't allow her to make such a decision. Whatever it will be, we will decide it.
[29:41] That can't be Safdar. She's young..
[29:45] She can do what she wants. We can't force her.
[29:50] The way you enforced your decision on her last time...
[29:54] you were at fault for what she did as well.
Mother, please...
[30:02] Don't blame father for the mistakes I made.
[30:06] He was thinking the best for me. I was the one who wronged myself and all of us.
[30:25] Father...
[30:30] Father, I wanted to apologize to you...
[30:35] You don't know how ashamed I am.
[30:40] I can't look at myself in the eyes, or you.
[30:48] Please forgive me.
[30:50] No my dear, it's not like that. It's enough for me that you realize that. Bless you.
[30:57] You know what... you're the best dad in this world.
[31:05] I promise you... I will never disappoint you again.
[31:10] And also... I overheard you two talking. I will marry whomever you ask me to... otherwise, I won't marry.
[31:23] Bless you, my dear. May God always give you happiness.
[31:53] You never understood me... you didn't even try to understand...
[32:04] When you come in front of me, I remember that night. You and him...
[32:27] Are you here alone? Where is your husband?
[32:33] He lives out of the city, because of business.
Bring him here next time. The first trimester is about to end.
[32:41] You need to be more careful now. There is no need to worry your reports are normal.
[32:49] But your blood pressure is high. I'll write you medicine for that...
[32:56] Other than that there is no problem.
[33:10] Faizan going to work is a good sign. What's the problem with that?
[33:16] He's started staying very busy. He doesn't give me enough time as it is and he meets me in secret, like a thief.
[33:23] But he uses work as an excuse to disappear for days.
Since when you've been interested in Faizan, It was his money...
[33:32] I thought you were interested in it.
Whatever it may be, he's my husband and I can't let him be away from me.
[33:39] Meaning, you don't want to lose Faizan or his wealth.
[33:44] This was not part of your plan Ramsha.
[33:50] But now it is.
[33:53] Whatever it may be, I don't want to lose Faizan at any cost.
[33:59] I want to have the status and respect in Faizan's house which I worked hard to get all my life.
[34:06] I've yearned for it all my life. Being Safdar Kamal's daughter-in-law...
[34:13] I want all the luxuries that Hadia is enjoying. And you'll see...
[34:21] that time isn't far away when I'll remove Hadia from Faizan's life.
[34:27] And you will help me do all this.
[34:32] Sure, I'll help you and how's that?
Find out about Razi...
[34:37] Reach him some way, he's the only person who can help us remove Hadia from Faizan's life.
[34:46] No... that can't be.
[34:50] Why not? Come on Zohaib...
[34:55] After all, you are Faizan's best friend. If you don't help me out, who will?
[35:03] This cannot happen, Razi is an honorable man. He is loyal to his uncle and he owes his uncle a lot.
[35:11] If he were that loyal, he wouldn't be having an affair with Hadia.
What?!
[35:17] No way! And even if he was having an affair with Hadia, he would never have the nerve to try and get her.
[35:26] No... you must find another way where you can degrade Hadia in front of Faizan and his father.
[35:36] That's why I want. But I need your help. I need your help.
[35:43] I'll think of something...
[35:50] Is that Hadia?
[36:10] What a pleasant surprise!
[36:30] What are you doing here alone?
I'm waiting for the driver. I was here for a check-up.
[36:36] That's Razi. The same guy we were just talking about.
[36:40] Wow! So this is Razi... that means...
[36:47] they really are having an affair.
See, I told you so...
[36:56] You should have come here with Faizan.
He had an important meeting, that's why I didn't disturb him.
[37:04] If he wasn't available, then you could have come with Fizza.
[37:09] And you could have asked Fizza to stay with you for a few days.
[37:25] I'll drop you off.
[38:07] It truly is amazing what happened today. The evidence that you needed...
[38:13] walked itself to you. It's your lucky day.
No Zohaib...
[38:19] These pictures and videos are not proof enough. We need solid proof to remove Hadia from Faizan's life.
[38:29] You'll find some way to do that as well.
[38:34] Call Faizan and show him that video...
[38:40] Show him these videos... end of discussion. No power on earth can take Faizan away from you now.
[38:49] Why don't you understand? All of this is not that easy. Hadia is about to become the mother to Faizan's child.
[38:58] He won't leave her so easily.
[39:02] Hadia and Razi. That's not a problem, you can give him a child as well.
[39:11] Can't believe that Hadia and Razi are having an affair.
[39:15] Fiza must not know this.
