[01:06] Sir, I've got one more information
[01:08] the account manager has told me that Faizan has done a fraud of millions of rupees from the company's account
[01:13] and he has transferred all the money in a girl's account namely Ramsha
[01:19] Faizan has married Ramsha secretly
[01:36] what happen Safder, at least say something
[01:47] go away from here
[01:50] I shall leave? what do you mean? At least say something
[01:54] both of you mother son duo had betrayed me
[01:58] what betrayal? I don't understand anything
[02:01] you knew everything, Sheena
[02:03] still you had kept me in the dark!
[02:07] our son married Ramsha
[02:09] still you stayed quiet & didn't even tell me
[02:15] I wish, you had done the right upbringing of your son & daughter
[02:21] then today I wouldn't be facing this day
[02:24] I had never thought of bringing Ramsha into Faizan's life
[02:27] I never wanted this. Why are you blaming me for this?
[02:31] no doubt that you haven't said that
[02:34] but if you had given Hadia her rightful status in her life
[02:38] then Faizan would have understood her importance
[02:40] and Ramsha would have stayed away from his life
[02:42] however, you know that Ramsha wasn't a nice girl
[02:45] So Hadia didn't proved to be a nice girl as well
[02:48] she did such a disgusting act which any noble girl couldn't have done
[02:52] she had hurt your affiance
[02:55] you used to consider her so pious
[02:58] still... 
[03:00] Hadia was far more better than that girl
[03:03] our son didn't give her that respect & status, which was her right
[03:07] and during this, anyone could have done a mistake
[03:09] since Hadia is your choice, therefore all of her mistakes are forgivable!
[03:14] yes I know, because she is the daughter of a noble man
[03:18] your son did a lot of injustice with her, I can never forget that
[03:24] I can forgive hundred of her such mistakes
[03:26] Faizan did this act just because of you, like the way Natasha.. 
[03:29] you are justifying your son's mistakes!
[03:32] there is a limit of shamelessness, Sheena
[03:35] call him! Call your son right away
[03:39] right away!
[03:56] we should talk to Nisar on this matter
[04:01] let Nisar come back first, then we will think about it
[04:05] Still I can't believe, how can Sheena play such a big game with our children
[04:10] I won't spare her so easily
[04:13] what will you do?
[04:15] I will go to her house
[04:17] No! there is no need for you to go there
[04:20] why?
[04:22] Safder shouldn't know what poisonous game her wife is playing with us!
[04:26] she had not only betrayed us, but she had played with our son's emotions
[04:31] and I will not forget both of them for this
[04:35] you are right
[04:36] honestly, you should go & tell the entire reality to brother Safder about his wife
[04:40] So that he should know what his wife is doing behind his back
[04:46] don't worry, I won't spare her so easily
[04:50] they have to answer me
[04:53] I will also go with you
[04:55] No, no.. for now I will go alone
[05:37] Razi, I cannot gather courage to go inside
[05:41] how will I tell everything to Khadija?
[05:44] she is already in a lot of trouble
[05:48] you are right
[05:51] Fizza was innocent & aunty knew it
[05:56] and the reality is that... 
[05:59] aunt Sheena has ruined the happiness of their other daughter as well
[06:06] may God have mercy
[06:08] yes dear
[06:10] Sheena did so wrong
[06:14] lets go, mom
[06:24] I don't understand
[06:28] whether I shall celebrate on this matter or I should curse my enemies
[06:34] our Fizza is innocent, we knew it from the very first day
[06:40] the loss is just that
[06:43] a good person like Nisar had left from Fizza's life
[06:49] I'm amazed
[06:51] I can't believe how come Sheena we so cold hearted
[06:57] but I am not amazed
[07:01] a person who cannot think good for their children, then how will they think good about other's children
[07:08] what kind of upbringing she did of her son & daughter
[07:12] and she isn't realizing it in this age as well?
[07:16] God willing
[07:19] God will make Fizza's fate better
[07:22] God willing
[07:29] as it is... 
[07:31] whatever you feel appropriate is fine
[07:34] but I will say, you should talk to Fizza's in-laws
[07:40] tell them the entire reality, they should know the truth
[07:45] and ask Sheena as well
[07:47] why she did such a big thing? What did she got by doing this?
[07:58] No sister Sajida
[08:03] I don't want to say anything to anyone
[08:08] I don't want to ask any question or so
[08:13] I've handover the matter of my both daughters in God's hands
[08:19] whoever had stained their character
[08:23] and whoever had believed it
[08:28] will be answerable to God
[08:35] my husband died
[08:41] my daughters have become an orphan
[08:47] no question or answer
[08:49] can rectify our grief & sorrows
[08:57] you are right
[09:05] aunty
[09:09] I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't or should have done this but... 
[09:16] I have told everything to Mr. Rehman
[09:25] you are my elder
[09:27] you know how to make a better decision but... 
[09:31] I've a request
[09:34] I think we should give one more chance to Mr. Rehman in this entire case
[09:41] because if someone else would have been in his place then he would have done the same thing for their children
[09:47] please
[09:49] if he comes again for Fizza then
[09:53] don't reject
[10:12] whenever I had trusted your son
[10:17] I had experienced pratfall
[10:22] actually your son is not capable for my trust
[10:32] dad
[10:34] is everything Okay? anything happened?
[10:42] dad, what happen say it. What's wrong?
[11:03] you are not capable to be called my son
[11:08] what not I did for you guys
[11:14] I gave you all the luxuries of this world
[11:18] and what you guys gave me in return? Grief & problems
[11:25] you had shown these days to a father who gave you a lifestyle of a prince
[11:31] disgusting person!
[11:33] you didn't feel a bit shameful
[11:36] furthermore... 
[11:38] you kept on blaming that innocent girl!
[11:42] while you were lying
[11:45] you had got married
[11:49] I've got to know that you... 
[11:51] are still sending her money from my account
[11:55] furthermore, you have sold my food factory
[12:05] oh Mr. Rehman you!
[12:09] I used to respect you & your wife a lot, Safder
[12:15] and I couldn't even think of anything wrong about you
[12:20] even today I won't talk to you with disrespect
[12:22] although you deserve it
[12:25] but I will question you
[12:27] what you got by doing this?
[12:30] brother Rehman, I didn't get anything
[12:36] ask your wife & tell me
[12:39] what did she get by giving millions of rupees to Fawad to defame my to be daughter in law
[12:46] what!
[12:52] why will Sheena do this?
[12:54] I knew it that you will say this
[12:57] that's why I... 
[13:00] I've brought proofs with me
[13:23] one should think before defaming anyone else's daughter
[13:27] that we also have a daughter in our house
[13:30] I will apologize to that girl anyhow
[13:34] but you also ask your wife, that what will she do now!
[13:44] Safder...
[13:46] don't know what is saying! he is lying
[13:52] you...
[13:55] why you did this, Sheena?
[13:58] dad, let me tell you
[14:03] actually mom did all of this because
[14:49] a woman whose own upbringing is not good cannot do her children upbringing in a good manner
[14:56] not only you did wrong upbringing of your children but..
[15:00] you weren't loyal to me
[15:04] I had trusted you a lot for my entire life
[15:09] and this is how you had repaid me
[15:21] you are not capable to live with me
[15:25] I end my relation with you
[15:31] I divorce you!
[15:32] dad please! don't say anything else please. Don't utter a single word please
[15:48] this woman doesn't worth my trust
[15:55] I had trusted her
[16:00] whatever you had said & asked me to do, I did!
[16:04] and she....
[16:05] She had put such a disgusting allegation on that girl!
[16:10] because of her allegation, my best friend Aleem who was more than a brother to me
[16:16] he left this world with that pain
[16:21] you are responsible for this deathjk, Sheena
[16:25] you are responsible for all these humiliations
[16:28] God will never forgive you
[16:32] women like you are a burden on this world
[16:43] how are you standing in front of me!
[16:48] I can never forgive you
[16:50] I don't have any place for you in my life!
[16:53] no relation...
[16:54] dad please! don't say anything else
[17:00] mom made a mistake
[17:02] I apologize on her behalf, please
[17:06] you
[17:07] you are apologizing! are your sins less?
[17:12] have some shame
[17:14] I was half of your age, I left my house
[17:19] I worked hard day & night
[17:22] I became independent
[17:24] made this house & factories, so that I could provide you a luxurious lifestyle
[17:32] but what you guys gave me in return?
[17:35] you guys gave me only humiliation!
[17:38] and griefs
[17:41] what was I thinking!
[17:45] I don't want such life
[17:49] where neither a wife is loyal nor the kids are obedient
[17:53] where is my money?
[17:55] tell me
[17:57] return me my money, give back my factory
[18:01] return my factory
[18:02] Salik had sold it right? He is behind it?
[18:05] yes
[18:06] where is he right now?
[18:09] he has gone to Dubai
[18:13] was there any third person who gave you this suggestion? Tell me his name
[18:17] it was Zohaib, he had introduced me to him. I didn't know him personally
[18:21] Zohaib
[18:23] come with me right away
[19:10] greetings!*
[19:13] where is Zohaib? he is not receiving my phone
[19:15] Mr. Zohaib is not at home, sir
[19:16] where is he?
[19:17] he is going to Dubai by tonight's flight
[19:20] also he had left with his luggage
[19:24] who else is at home
nobody
[20:42] hi Taimoor, how are you?
[20:43] you fled away by putting me into hot water
[20:46] I had forbidden you not to transfer the ownership of the factory in my name
[20:50] what do you mean? Is everything alright?
[20:53] ask me what not had happened
[20:55] Safder Kamal came here to my office to investigate about you
[20:58] what!
[21:00] then?
[21:00] I said, I sold that factory to you as per my will after purchasing it from Faizan
[21:05] and now I am not concerned about this matter
[21:09] remember one more thing, Salik
[21:11] if any matter will come on my head, then I won't spare you & Zohaib
[21:17] Okay, don't take tension. Let me do something
[22:04] Safder Kamal has got to know everything...
[22:07] you & Ramsha leave for Dubai from the very first flight
[22:09] what!
[22:11] what rubbish! how?
[22:13] don't know one of you did a stupidity and...
[22:16] they have got the entire detail
[22:22] so now?
[22:23] Taimoor had called as well
[22:26] he is also quite worried, the police has reached his house
[22:41] Safder Kamal has got to know about our plan
[22:55] no, no...
[22:58] we cannot stay here, we have to go
[22:59] right away! lets go
[23:02] all the documents are in front of you
[23:05] Salik is the person who had provoked my son & transferred the ownership of the factory in his name
[23:11] and he escaped from the country with all the money
[23:15] we've sent a letter to UAE consulate about Salik
[23:21] another guy was involved with him in this matter, what was his name...
[23:25] Zohaib
[23:26] yes Zohaib
[23:28] that guy is also escaping from the country tonight
[23:30] and along with him, there is a ticket of a girl namely Ramsha
[23:34] whatever it is
[23:37] make sure to arrest all of them
[23:39] before they escape the country
[23:42] they are the reason behind this destruction
[23:52] hello!
[23:54] yes yes, Okay
[23:57] put Ramsha & Zohaib's name in ECL as well
[24:00] yes, the arrest warrant is ready
[24:03] ok don't worry
[24:07] yes
[24:10] thank you, sir
[24:12] welcome
[24:21] I must say, both of you guys shall leave from here as soon as possible
[24:24] Safder Kamal will be here anytime with the police
[24:27] what if they arrested us at the airport, then?
[24:30] that's why I'm saying, leave from here as soon as possible
[24:34] they will be here anytime
[24:36] and yes! do leave the cash over here otherwise the custom will take it at the airport
[24:41] aunty, what are you saying? Its a matter of one crore rupees. How can we leave them over here?
[24:44] I'm here, why are you worrying? tomorrow I will deposit them to Ramsha's account
[24:49] and you guys shall leave from here as soon as possible
[24:51] take the first flight
[24:54] if they reach here, then you won't be able to get away
[24:56] look, we don't have any other option than this one. Come on be quick
[25:13] go!
[25:13] don't you dare! Nobody will move a bit
[25:17] you back stabber! I had considered you my friend. Fraudster!
[25:29] I thought you love me
[25:30] No Faizan
[25:32] I haven't done anything
[25:34] believe me, I haven't done anything
[25:37] all of this was Zohaib's planning
[25:41] I, myself got fooled by him
[25:47] Safder uncle, get him arrested
[25:53] he got your factory sold
[25:56] I'm your daughter in law, the honor of your family. How could you get me arrested?
[26:01] the girls of a respectable family don't do such things that you did
[26:04] start your proceedings
[26:06] proceedings?
 I'm telling you, I have done nothing!
[26:10] Zohaib made us meet Salik
[26:13] I didn't even knew him
[26:18] and Faizan, why are you quiet?
[26:23] you know I am not that kind of a girl
[26:26] I love you
[26:29] and I am about to become the mother of your baby
[26:33] what!
[26:35] what is she saying, Faizan?
[26:36] Faizan, save me! please save me
[26:39] unlce, she is lying! Faizan, she is doing a drama of pregnancy
[26:43] shut up! you wretched person! Fraudster
[26:48] it was your idea to sell off Faizan's factory by Salik's help
[26:53] and you will get punished for it for sure
[26:56] I am innocent, are you guys listening!
[26:58] Mr. Safder, my daughter is innocent. She haven't done anything
[27:03] the entire drama is created by Salik & Zohaib, they did everything
[27:08] she is so naive & not criminal minded to do such acts
[27:12] how criminal minded your daughter is, let me tell them!
[27:16] uncle! Faizan, listen to my story for once. After that I will accept whatever you say
[27:23] uncle, let me tell you the entire truth
[27:26] Ramsha had trapped me along with her mother
[27:29] hey! he is lying.. we haven't done any such thing
[27:32] I'm not lying!
[27:34] it was their plan
[27:35] Faizan, for how long do you know me? I had told you earlier as well to get over Ramsha
[27:40] had I or not?
[27:42] they did an entire drama to remove Hadia from your life, it was a plan by them!
[27:47] I had explained this to you earlier as well
[27:49] uncle, I swear it to you. Faizi, there isn't any such thing
[27:53] I haven't made any plan for that factory, nothing as such had happened. She even black mailed me for this
[27:59] enough of your drama! 
Arrest both of them!
[28:04] hey no, no...
take them away
[28:06] leave me! I won't go
take them
[28:08] leave me!
come to the police station!
[28:10] for God sake leave my daughter, forgive her. She hasn't done anything
[28:14] Faizan, you love her right?
[28:18] but Faizan, you love her!
[28:28] dad, I'm sorry
[28:32] trust me, I didn't know that they are of such kind
[28:38] I was blinded, I didn't know what to do
[28:44] I'm really sorry
[29:18] hello!
[29:19] Salik, we are destroyed!
[29:23] Faizan & Safder Kamal has got to know everything about us
[29:28] just a while ago, they came here along with the police
[29:33] they took away Ramsha & Zohaib after arresting them
[29:38] oh my God!
[29:40] for God sake do something
[29:42] do something, get my daughter released
[29:46] I don't have anyone in this world except for Ramsha
[29:49] for God sake, get her out
[29:54] aunty, don't you worry
[30:02] just wait & watch, what I am going to do with Faizan
[30:24] what shall I do, oh God!
[30:27] my Ramsha...
[30:32]  my Ramsha...
[30:48] their son & daughter both were present there
[30:52] Safder wasn't aware of all this
[30:55] you did very well by going there & exposing Sheena in front of all
[31:00] yes maybe...
[31:02] Sheena didn't had an idea that her alacrity will come like this in front of all
[31:09] she should know how to feel by making others life a living hell
[31:13] the people who adds poison to others life don't sit in peace ever
[31:18] one day or the other their life also becomes a living hell
[31:20] So, what do you think? Will they agree for reconciliation?
[31:26] what can I say?
[31:28] what's the harm in trying
[31:32] if brother Aleem would have been alive today, then I would have personally apologized to him
[31:37] he had complete trust on his daughters, but we didn't listen to a single word
[31:42] that poor guy didn't uttered a word when I had called to call off the engagement
[31:48] if someone else would have been in his place then he would have misbehaved with me
[31:52] but the poor guy, he didn't even uttered a single word
[31:56] may God rest his soul in peace
[31:59] Amen
[32:01] so tell me, when are we visiting their house?
[32:04] let Nisar come, then we will go together
[32:08] I think we shouldn't take Nisar right now
[32:12] let us go first & check this matter on our own
[32:25] how life take turns
[32:30] we are unable to understand
[32:36] whatever we saw
[32:39] whatever we had suffered
[32:41] don't know whether it was reality or a dream
[32:52] how we had planned to come into this house
[32:56] and how we came here
[33:03] we had never thought that we had to come here in such a hurry
[33:10] and now soon we'll leave this house
[33:18] mom I...
[33:21] I'm guilty
[33:23] maybe all of this had happened because of me, but you know the reality
[33:33] don't worry
[33:38] the place where I have applied for the job
[33:41] I'm very sure that I will get a job there
[33:47] once we will leave this country then
[33:52] God willing everything will be fine
[34:00] who came at this hour?
[34:04] go check
[34:06] let me go & check
[34:30] I don't have words to start this conversation
[34:41] I...
[34:43] I took my decisions so hastily
[34:49] I took no time in putting allegations
[34:56] sister, I'm not only guilty on my actions but...
[35:02] I'm regretting
[35:06] I didn't even think for once that what a big allegation I'm about to put on Razi
[35:13] I blamed my daughter in law
[35:21] and I'm facing its consequences
[35:25] what is happening with my family, its in front of you
[35:32] I am almost ruined, sister
[35:44] what else I can do, that I shall fold my hands...
[35:46] please uncle!
[35:55] I have always considered you as my father
[36:03] you can beat me, scold me but you cannot apologize to me
[36:08] I was expecting this from you
[36:12] stay blessed
[36:18] stay happy
[36:24] will you guys keep on talking while standing here or will you sit?
[36:28] let me bring tea
[36:30] yes
[36:31] uncle, come.. sit
[36:36] I've made this small house with my hard work
[36:39] All praise to God!
[36:45] it takes an entire life to understand someone
[36:49] and we understand some matters at the end of our life
[36:55] I had a doubt that, if some else would have been in my place then he would have done the same thing
[37:04] but today, after brother Aleem's death
[37:09] I've realized that..
[37:12] if brother Aleem would have been in my place then he would have never done this
[37:17] its just
[37:19] the matter of everyone's nature
[37:23] I cannot reach his status
[37:29] I became the reason of his hurting
[37:35] and it will always keep me upset
[37:41] may God bless your with a long life for your daughters
[37:46] I came with a request of reconciliation by apologizing to you
[38:04] brother, only suffering was written in our fate
[38:10] nobody can change the fate
[38:15] its just that
[38:17] whichever allegations were put on my daughters are removed
[38:22] they are proved pious
[38:27] thank God!
[38:30] I'm happy
[38:35] and I'm sure that
[38:38] their father must be happy there
[38:51] its just that
[38:56] nobody comes back from there
[39:05] this loss is irreparable
[39:11] so sister Khadija...
[39:14] are we allowed to make Fizza wear the ring once again?
[39:19] my daughter was so hurt
[39:24] because of the breaking of this relation
[39:31] she had to listen a lot of taunts by people
[39:38] she had tolerated dirty stares
[39:46] she had locked herself in a room
[39:50] she changed her college
[39:53] she lost her trust from her friends
[40:01] she has tolerated a lot of suffering
[40:08] therefore....
[40:11] I cannot make this decision for her
[40:17] Fizza will make this decision herself
[40:23] whether she wants to get into this relation
[40:27] or to continue with it
[40:30] only she will tell you
[40:33] not me
