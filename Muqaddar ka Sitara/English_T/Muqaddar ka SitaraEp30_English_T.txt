[01:11] You shouldn't have talked to your father like that. You don't listen to me.
[01:17] No matter how he is, he's your father and you should respect him.
[01:22] It's the children that always have to take care of the responsibility. But what about the parents? Don't they have any responsibility?
[01:28] I've been here for so many days, but father hasn't asked about me once.
[01:34] And when he called today, he didn't ask me how I am, where I am...
[01:40] or the state I am in.
I admit that he's at fault.
[01:44] But you're not right as well.
[01:47] Natasha, you should fight for your right, but not in a way that upsets him.
[01:53] Natasha, you are very naive, I have to understand everything about you.
[02:01] Look, if you do as I say, you will endure any loss.
[02:06] I know that you hate me, but I'm still looking out for you.
[02:13] Because I love you.
[02:18] Whether you admit it or not, this is love.
[02:23] Seeing you in trouble makes me worried about you.
[02:27] If you listen to me, you will never endure a loss.
[02:32] I'm with you.
[02:35] Please, don't ever think that you're alone. There is always a certain time...
[02:40] and way to do something.
[02:43] Listen to me, call your lawyer and tell him not to go against your father.
[02:51] Look, I'll tell you what you need to do and when you need to do it.
[02:58] Natasha, these matters of inheritance are not sorted out by being brash.
[03:03] That way you will only antagonize your parents even more.
[03:07] But I won't let that happen.
[03:11] But I am your well-wisher.
[03:14] Don't worry.
[04:08] Greetings, how are you? How do you like my surprise?
[04:13] What surprise?
[04:15] I came back early.
So, you could have stayed.
[04:20] Are you not happy I'm here?
[04:22] When did I say that? I'm just saying that you went back after such a long time, you should have stayed, it would have made your parents very happy.
[04:28] But I was very sad, I can't bear to live without you. So I've decided that whenever I go back, I won't go to stay.
[04:35] And even if I do, I'll take you with me. How did you spend your two days? How goes your studies?
[04:43] Good...
[04:55] Tell me, how was your day at work today? Was work well?
[05:01] Yes, thank God.
[05:03] Here is tea for the two of you.
Only two cups? Why didn't you make one for yourself?
[05:08] I've already had mine.
Really... that was quick.
[05:14] Thank you so much Farwa.
You're welcome
[05:17] Razi, did you and Safdar come back home together from work?
[05:21] No mother, I left for home early.
[05:26] Uncle was at work.
[05:28] My dear, Safdar is very worried because of Natasha.
[05:34] Take care of your uncle at work.
[05:37] If you need anything, ask me.
[05:42] Sure mother, I'll be sure to do that.
[05:46] Mother, brother Razi seems different, doesn't he? He doesn't seem like his older version.
[05:54] By God's good grace, he seems very happy.
[05:58] Yes... it seems that way to me as well.
Tell me, what is it?
[06:04] No, it's nothing like that. You two are misunderstood.
[06:08] No, my dear, there is a reason. Both of us can't be wrong.
[06:14] Mother, I'm very happy about my work.
[06:18] A new project is incoming and I'm expecting to lead it.
[06:24] Really?
[06:26] Yes...
Wow... thank God.
[06:32] May God give you overnight success. This is great news!
Amen.
[06:41] Yes mother, if God is willing.
[06:44] So, does that mean that brother Faizan will stop interfering in your matters?
[06:49] He still isn't involved in it.
[06:52] Once I get this project, I'll go far away from here.
[06:58] What are you saying? Don't say such things.
[07:01] No, I was saying that regarding my work.
[07:08] Still, I won't let you go far away from my gaze.
[07:11] But mother, come with me.
[07:15] Alright, tell me, when is your project starting?
[07:19] No, we've just started working on it. As soon as uncle finalizes it, then it will go further.
[07:29] What about Faizan? Is he not with you?
[07:31] Mother, please pray...
[07:37] that uncle doesn't think of that.
[07:40] I don't know why, I can't tolerate that man.
[07:46] That's very bad, you shouldn't say that.
[07:49] Faizan is your cousin and he's like your brother.
[07:52] One doesn't nurture hatred for family.
No mother, I know...
[07:59] You know me, I can never think bad for anyone.
[08:06] But that man...
[08:09] always degrades me, and that's why I want to go far away from him.
[08:14] Why do you feel bad? God has promised us nourishment...
[08:19] He is the one who nourishes us all. He gives to his people from places that they do not know.
[08:27] You will get the nourishment that is destined for you.
[08:31] Just comply with the decisions of God.
[08:34] He makes everything better.
[08:43] My name is Razi...
[08:46] And Razi always complies with the decisions of God.
[08:53] Brother, don't you think you're forgetting something?
[08:59] You needed to pay my semester fees.
[09:02] Oh yes, I remember it. Don't worry about it...
[09:07] God willing, I'll pay for it on my way to work tomorrow.
Thank you.
[09:10] Welcome.
[09:22] She's very innocent.
[09:26] She's very simple.
[09:31] I don't know why...
[09:34] but she thinks my false love for her is true.
[09:37] And... for the first time in my life, I feel guilty and you know that I don't feel guilty.
[09:44] I never used to get upset, no matter what.
[09:49] Nothing is right.
[09:53] She loves me unconditionally and I...
[09:57] am constantly being disloyal to her.
[10:02] I mean...
[10:07] I'm lying to her continuously.
[10:12] She's your wife and it's in her nature to love you.
[10:17] Besides, you were impressed by her beauty.
I tried staying away from her.
[10:23] I mean, I did try...
[10:29] Her innocence...
[10:32] Her beauty...
[10:35] attracts me to her.
[10:42] I've started to like Hadia...
[10:53] I don't know, but I can't leave Ramsha...
[10:58] I've promised her as well. But I don't want to leave Hadia as well...
[11:02] I promised Ramsha if my father learns of this, he will never forgive me. You know how he is...
[11:07] He will disown me and that's insane.
[11:12] You understand right? I can't hurt anyone, neither Ramsha nor Hadia.
[11:18] I promised her that I'll marry her and I don't think I can follow through with that promise.
[11:23] Are you insane?
[11:27] You've become a sandwich between two girls.
[11:30] A man traveling on two separate ships can never be happy.
[11:35] Listen to me, get rid of Ramsha...
[11:39] If your dad learns of this, he will oust you from his home.
[11:44] And if that happens, forget about Ramsha, no girl in this world will look at you.
I can't leave her...
[11:53] Do you love her?
[11:57] What kind of question is that?
Do you love her?
[12:04] Of course, I do.
I don't think that it's love.
[12:08] I think you're only afraid of her.
[12:13] Ramsha has used a lot of people and developed a firm grip on you.
[12:19] Sly girls like Ramsha fool men like you...
What are you saying?
[12:24] I'm telling you that I love her and you're saying that nonsense. She has suffered a lot for me...
[12:34] I promised her that we'll live and die together and I won't break her heart. I can't break Hadia's heart for anyone!
[12:44] We were talking about Ramsha.
[12:54] Bro, you love Hadia, I knew it.
[13:01] At least don't lie to me... I knew it.
[13:05] Why am I even talking to you?
Alright, I'm sorry...
[13:10] Okay, I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry Faizi.
[13:16] I said I'm sorry. Come on Faizi!
[13:43] Liar... coward!
[13:46] What is it now? Who are you angry at now?
[13:50] Faizan, ever since his wife came back, he hasn't been picking up my calls.
[13:55] He didn't come to meet me as well. I had entrapped him...
[14:00] He couldn't pass a day without meeting me...
[14:05] I will not let Hadia ruin my hard work so easily.
[14:13] Faizan will have to be mine.
I told you so many times...
[14:17] that you won't succeed, but you didn't listen once to me...
[14:23] You will gain nothing from a cowardly man like Faizan.
[14:30] I don't know about that, but right now I don't have much time to think about some fling.
[14:36] Right now I'm thinking of ways to entrap Faizan...
[14:41] I'm not only worried about that. Faizan still hasn't given me this month's allowance.
[14:47] If Faizan stops his hand, then where will we go?
You're not his wife...
[14:53] that he would give you a monthly allowance to spend.
[14:58] Ramsha this is enough. Forget about Faizan...
[15:02] Think of some other option.
Don't tell me about other options, just tell me how to win Faizan over.
[15:10] What should I do that makes him mine and makes him marry me?
[15:15] You will not gain anything by marrying him. Safdar will never accept you.
[15:21] I'll remove that old man out of the way in a snap once Faizan is mine.
[15:28] Mother, please help me. Tell me something that will force Faizan to marry me.
[15:36] I don't care if he married me in hiding. Once he marries me...
[15:41] then I will find a way.
He will never accept.
[15:46] He is a cowardly man.
[15:51] Anyways...
[15:52] If you're that desperate...
[15:56] then I'll have to think of something.
[16:09] He's not picking up?
No, he's not.
[16:14] I'll find some way.
[16:36] Natasha...
[16:41] Natasha...
Hmm?
[16:46] I've bought these things for the kitchen, I'll hire a maid from tomorrow. But you'll have to cook.
[16:54] I told you before and I'm telling you again...
[16:58] I don't know how to cook. Until I'm here, I'll bear my expenses.
[17:05] And my mother gave me some money. When they end, she'll send some more through her driver.
[17:12] And, did you service my car? I could hear a noise coming from it.
[17:17] I did go to the mechanic, but the bill to fix that is very high.
[17:23] I don't have so much money right now
[17:27] Take the money from me tomorrow.
[17:33] I may be poor but I'm not that shallow...
[17:37] I'm your husband, I can't spread my hands in front of you for everything.
[17:42] I'll do everything for you according to my standard.
[17:48] I will make sure you lack nothing.
[18:01] As if anything he says is the truth. I know him very well.
[19:10] Yes, auntie...
Faizan, where are you, my dear?
[19:13] You haven't visited us in two days. Ramsha is very upset, she misses you.
[19:19] I'm busy right now. I won't be able to visit for a few days, I did tell her that. I've transferred the money to your account.
[19:25] Faizan we don't need your money, we need you.
[19:29] Sure, auntie, I'll come by. Tell her to be ready, I'll take her for dinner tonight.
[19:35] Enough is enough. How much longer will you stall on my daughter because of your father?
[19:41] People have been making all sorts of stories about visits. The landlord has asked us to empty the house.
[19:51] What do you want?
[19:52] You're not a child who doesn't understand. This is not America...
[19:58] where there is a boyfriend-and-girlfriend culture. This is our religion...
[20:04] and this is our country. We have to act accordingly. To prove our love...
[20:10] we need to send out proposals...
[20:16] You'll have to marry Ramsha soon.
You know that isn't possible right now.
[20:21] Enough Faizan. Things are out of our control.
[20:27] The water has gone over our heads.
[20:30] The affair between you and Ramsha has spread in our society, what do you want?
[20:36] Do you want to defame my daughter? So that you don't accept her, nor does anyone else.
[20:42] Will my daughter wait for you for her entire life? Men lose nothing in such matters...
[20:48] Girls are the ones who are defamed...
[20:52] I admit that Ramsha's father lives in a different city, but he is not unaware of her. He knows everything.
[20:58] If this reaches his ears, he will file a complaint against you.
[21:03] He will drag you through the mud.
[21:08] What do you want?
Our neighbors are making all sorts of stories about your visits here...
[21:14] Before the landlord ousts us...
[21:18] I want you to marry Ramsha.
[21:22] Marry her... once you get married to her...
[21:27] you and your family will have to comply. Then you can convince your family.
[21:34] What?
Once you have a child, your parents will have to agree.
[21:40] Bring a few friends on Friday, marry Ramsha, and take her with you.
[21:47] I'll take care of Ramsha's father. Once the marriage is done, no one will be able to do anything.
[21:54] The rest we'll figure out later.
[21:57] Auntie, you know this is a big step and I can't take it hiding it from my family.
[22:02] You need to do this the way you...
[22:08] met my daughter in secret...
[23:14] What is the matter, Faizan?
[23:20] Ever since I've returned I can see that you've been upset.
[23:24] It's nothing like that.
[23:27] There is something that you're hiding from me.
[23:32] As I said, it's nothing like that.
[23:35] Are you sure?
[23:37] Of course, I'm sure. Why are you so persistent? I'm your husband, you should believe me.
[23:42] When I said it's nothing like that, then there isn't.
I fully trust you.
[23:50] I fear that you might get upset with me again.
[23:58] Faizan, there is no trusting your mood. Sometimes you're good, sometimes you're not.
[24:09] Do you know what the problem is?
[24:14] You're very nice...
[24:17] You take such good care of me...
[24:20] Why would I be upset at you?
[24:29] I just get afraid.
[24:32] Of what?
Of losing you.
[24:36] I fear that you might go far away from me...
[24:40] Do you know...
[24:42] You are the one I trust the most in this world.
[24:47] Is that the truth...
[24:57] Don't love me too much.
[25:07] I'm not worthy of your love.
[26:12] If you miss her that much...
[26:16] then call her back.
[26:18] Forgive her.
[26:25] I forgave her...
[26:31] she made me realize...
[26:36] that I made a mistake forgiving her.
[26:43] Actually, she is...
[26:46] not worthy of my forgiveness.
[26:50] Please Safdar...
[26:52] She's your daughter.
[26:57] She made a mistake, she's naive.
[27:02] Naive?
[27:06] Naive is someone who regrets their mistake.
[27:12] Naive is someone who is ashamed.
[27:14] Not someone who makes the mistake over and over again.
[27:21] She's my daughter...
[27:25] I couldn't even imagine staying away from her.
[27:34] I had no intention of removing her from my inheritance.
[27:40] This was all a show, so she comes back home, out of fear.
[27:48] But...
[27:52] what did she do?
[27:58] She ruined my respect.
[28:12] She threatened me to drag me through court.
[28:17] She said that she'll talk about me in the media.
[28:25] It's not her fault.
[28:28] It's our fault.
[28:34] We didn't raise her the way we should have.
[28:43] I wonder about those lucky parents...
[28:53] The only thing I've taken from this is that...
[29:03] I'll never be able to experience joy from my children.
[29:20] Excuse me.
[30:36] Drink this.
[30:39] Why, what is in it?
[30:41] It's blessed water. Drinking it will drive your tensions away.
[30:49] How do you know I'm tense?
I know everything.
[30:56] No matter whether you share it with me, or not. But I know that you're worried since last night.
[31:01] I decided to help you out. Drink, it will work as an anti-depressant for you...
[31:12] What is mixed into it?
It's blessed water. I blew holy verses into it.
[31:23] Do you believe these things?
[31:28] Tell me one thing, why do you eastern girls employ such tactics to control their husbands?
[31:35] What tactics? I don't need to do these things to win over your love.
[31:43] I've been trying to do that with my love and care.
[31:48] And I will continue doing so and then one day I'll succeed.
[31:59] You don't need to do anything to impress me.
[32:06] You've already made your place in m heart.
[32:10] Really?
[32:14] You're so lovely and innocent.
[32:22] No one may dislike you.
[32:48] It's magical, there's magic inside it.
I told you so.
[32:57] It's working.
So soon?
[33:01] What you did wasn't right Natasha! It was hard for me to make your place in Safdar's heart.
[33:12] You burned all bridges.
You were wrong to think that he could forgive me.
[33:19] He doesn't care about me.... please help me mother, don't add to my worries.
[33:28] Nothing has happened. Talk to your lawyer and take your case back.
[33:35] I promise that I will Safdar to you and he will accept you.
[33:41] No mother, I will stay on the decision I've taken. No matter to what extent I have to go to.
[33:48] I will take my rights.
[33:52] Are you insane? You know your father, right? He won't name a single penny to your name.
[34:00] How will he not?
[34:03] I don't know how I should make you understand.
Don't try and make me understand, make father understand.
[34:10] Give me my right, otherwise, he'll be responsible for what happens.
You will do no such thing.
[34:17] You will take such a step.
[34:19] I will, and everyone will witness it. I've seen father's hatred, now he'll see mine.
[34:53] She's very nice... I mean...
[34:58] I mean so nice that I'm attracted to her. I can't stop that from happening.
[35:05] It's becoming impossible
[35:12] I'm talking to you.
Trying to sort out your marriage issue is making me feel like a married man.
[35:19] Help me out, I'm sharing something with you.
What is the problem...
[35:25] she's your wife, you're her husband. You're attracted to her and she is too, it's very natural. Isn't this how it happens?
[35:34] But... what have you decided about Ramsha...
Ramsha...
[35:47] Speak of the devil, she's calling.
Pick it up...
[35:52] I'll talk to her later, not now.
You're avoiding her.
[35:56] That means you're not interested in her anymore.
No, I'm not avoiding her.
[36:02] You don't understand Faizi, you're not interested in Ramsha anymore.
I'm not avoiding her...
[36:10] The problem is that Ramsha and I don't have normal conversations anymore. We always fight when we talk.
[36:17] All we do is fight and nothing else. Maybe it's my fault because I'm unable to give her time nowadays.
[36:24] Listen to me, save yourself from Ramsha. You're already in trouble...
[36:32] be in between. Do you think uncle will forgive you for doing this?
[36:38] What about Hadia? How much pain it will cause her when she learns of it?
[36:45] You're cheating on Hadia.
I love Ramsha and I only love her.
[36:52] Hadia is just too nice. I'm only attracted to her because of that. It's not love.
[36:58] I promised Ramsha that I can't leave her.
[37:07] Hadia knows a little about Ramsha.
What!
[37:15] You told her about Ramsha...
I did not... I told her a little bit... but it's sorted now.
[37:25] She believed you?
[37:30] What kind of innocent girl is she?
[37:34] What else should I do? That's exactly what I'm saying. I don't know what to do. On one hand, is Hadia and on the other is Ramsha.
[37:42] What should I do?
[37:51] Faizi... take this.
[37:55] Come here...
[38:04] It's not bad.
[38:10] Safdar didn't have breakfast today. He left without eating.
Aunt Shina seems off as well.
[38:18] I think they fought.
[38:21] They are worried because of Natasha. Especially Safdar.
[38:28] That foolish girl has ruined her parents because of her desires.
[38:34] Lord knows if she's happy or not. Sister Shina has always been worried for her.
[38:42] She's been upset ever since her uncle decided to remove Natasha from the inheritance.
[38:48] Why would she want Safdar to remove her daughter from her inheritance?
[38:53] God forbid, what if that happens?
If that happens, then it is very worrisome.
[39:01] Sister Shina is already upset at us. If this happens she won't tolerate us here for a moment.
[39:10] If it were up to her she would oust her today. We're staying here because of my uncle.
[39:16] I was thinking about it... if this happens we'll leave on our own accord.
[39:26] Obviously, we'll have to do that, what else...
