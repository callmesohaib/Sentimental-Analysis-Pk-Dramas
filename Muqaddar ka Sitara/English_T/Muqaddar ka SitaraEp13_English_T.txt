[01:07] Listen,
[01:10] Hadia's in laws are coming for dinner for the first time.
[01:14] Have you made all preparations?
[01:18] See, nothing should be amiss.
[01:21] No don't worry. We don't need anything. Fizza and I will manage everything.
[01:28] Its good.
[01:31] By the way Khadijah, tell me something, are you alright?
[01:37] Yes.
[01:39] I mean, you were a little disturbed last night. It seems you didn't sleep well.
[01:50] I was missing Hadia.
[01:54] I was worried whether she's happy there or not.
[01:59] Why wouldn't she be happy there?
[02:01] Safdar is there to take care of him.
[02:06] And Faizan?
[02:11] Will Faizan care for Hadia?
[02:17] Will he give her the respect she deserves?
[02:21] As God wills. He will take care.
[02:26] Our daughter is very happy there.
[02:29] We should always hope for the good from God.
[02:38] Should I call Hadia?
[02:42] This isn't the right time. Wait a little
[02:49] Alright. I'll go and check things in the kitchen.
[02:53] Alright. You do that. I'll go check my clothes.
[03:02] I'm fine mom. How are you?
[03:04] I'm fine too. I was missing you so I thought I'd call.
[03:09] Even I am missing you.
[03:12] I just want to come to you running.
[03:15] Tell me is everyone coming for dinner tonight?
[03:20] I don't know mom. Nobody said anything yet.
[03:23] Why? Aleem told me that brother Safdar promised he'll bring everyone.
[03:30] That's why Faizan has gone to uncle's room to talk.
[03:34] Is Faizan behaving fine with you, dear?
[03:38] Yes mom. He's good.
[03:42] Thank God, dear. I was very much worried.
[03:45] Mom, I'm happy here. Don't worry.
[03:49] May God always keep you happy.
[03:53] Parents are always worried about their daughters even if they're married.
[03:57] Let it be. Just come fast. And pay my regards to everyone.
[04:03] Even I cannot wait. I just want the evening to come so that I can come to you.
[04:08] I'll meet you then. Take care. Bye.
[04:14] Bye.
[04:28] What? I'll take Hadia to her house in Hyderabad?
[04:34] Impossible. I'm not going back there.
[04:38] I went for the wedding once.
[04:40] I'm not going again. Its enough.
[04:46] I was expecting this answer from you.
[04:49] Go once, I'll not ask you again.
[04:53] I went once, I'll not go again. The place irritates me. I'm sorry.
[05:15] Both of you take her.
[05:20] What? We?
[05:25] No way dad. I'm not going at all.
[05:30] What behavior is this? She is the daughter in law of our house.
[05:35] Its her right to be taken to her house. I would have taken her myself if I didn't have a meeting.
[05:40] You people talk weirdly. At least look into things a little.
[05:44] Uncle you called?
[05:46] Yes dear. Come and sit.
[05:54] I'll just go and look at Kulsoom in the kitchen.
[05:57] I'm also getting a call. I'll see you.
[06:09] Dear, you must talk to brother Aleem, how is your mother?
[06:17] I just talked to mom.
[06:20] Everything is fine, thanks to God. She send her regards and asked if everyone was coming for dinner.
[06:26] greetings to her as well.
[06:29] Dear I called you for this reason.
[06:33] Your auntie has some work and I have an important meeting.
[06:41] We will not be able to go but I apologize.
[06:44] I know brother Aleem and your mother invited us with so much love.
[06:49] I promise we'll go some other time.
[06:52] I have a request dear.
Can I send you with the driver, would it be okay?
[07:01] I'll call brother Aleem and tell him, I think he'll not mind as well.
[07:06] Isn't Faizan going as well?
[07:10] Faizan?
[07:14] Alright, I'll go with the driver. Don't worry.
Thank you dear.
[07:22] Your auntie told you about Faizan and his friend.
Yes she did.
[07:32] Please don't mention it to your family.
[07:36] Don't worry.
[07:40] I know Hadia dear, there is a lot of difference in our house and your house.
[07:48] But now you have to spend your life here so adjust to this environment.
[07:57] I will try my best.
[08:00] But don't just adjust yourself. In fact the positive traits I liked in you,
[08:10] I went to brother Aleem's house, that traditions, the love and closeness,
[08:15] you have to build that here as well.
[08:21] Prayers, closeness to family, respect for elders.
[08:27] Dear, I know my family is very dissociated from all this,
[08:32] but you can instill this in their hearts.
[08:38] This isn't easy uncle,
[08:42] if there is no love for something in your heart, it becomes difficult to accept it.
[08:48] I will try my best but it will take time.
[08:52] Dear, take as much time as you want.
[08:56] I have no objections. I trust you completely.
[09:01] May you live long. Come on get ready.
[09:14] Hadia, are you ready dear?
Yes almost done.
[09:18] Where is Faizan? Isn't he coming with you?
No.
[09:24] Why?
[09:26] He has some important meeting that's why he couldn't go.
[09:30] Important meeting? But he doesn't even visit Safdar's office.
[09:42] He might have had to meet his friend. I don't know.
[09:46] Alright but,
[09:51] this isn't right. You're going to see your family after your wedding. Someone should have gone with you.
[09:59] Won't your family disapprove of it.
[10:01] No, its alright. I'll tell them.
[10:04] The driver is waiting. Should I leave?
Yes. Bye.
[10:11] Pay my regards to your mother.
yes
[10:17] I missed you so much, you have no idea.
[10:22] Are you mad? We just met yesterday and you missed me?
[10:25] Yes of course because I love you so much. If you loved me, you would have realized.
[10:32] Listen to her talk. She's talking as if she met you after ages.
[10:36] Of course mom. I am not used to living without Hadia. My room is so empty.
[10:42] You'll not leave before a month now.
[10:45] Leave her dear, she'll keep on talking. Tell me, why are you alone...
[10:49] Mom, where is dad?
[10:52] He went to the market to get something for you. He'll come after prayers.
[10:56] Dad will ask the same question that you stopped mom from asking.
[11:01] You hide things from us as well.
[11:05] There's nothing to tell. What should I tell?
[11:09] Safdar uncle said brother Faizan would come to drop you himself.
[11:13] Actually he got food poisoning and his friend got into a serious accident.
[11:23] So will you go back alone or will he come to pick you up?
[11:28] I'll find out tomorrow.
[11:32] Fizza, you have started an inquiry from her.
[11:35] You were making arrangements since yesterday, now show them to her.
[11:40] Let dad come and I'll show everyone together.
[11:43] But you bought a dress from the market. Go get those.
[11:51] Dear, are you alright?
[11:55] Yes mom.
[12:01] Fizza is right. The house is empty without you.
[12:17] Do you miss me now?
[12:18] Hello love.
[12:21] How are you?
[12:22] What do you care whether I live or die.
[12:27] You cannot imagine how worried I was for you. I missed you.
[12:31] Oh please. I was fighting for my life and you got married peacefully.
[12:38] Ramsha, I was forced to get married but trust me I was worried about you.
[12:44] I don't need that. Please keep your fake concern to yourself.
[12:49] Alright tell me how much did you have to spend, I'll send you the money.
[12:52] I don't need any money. You think I'm greedy like your dad did.
[12:58] I told you I took that money for my mother..
[13:02] Listen you also cheated me so don't forget that.
[13:06] and the matter is that...
[13:09] I love you. I cannot live without you.
[13:11] So why don't you just accept that you love me?
[13:14] Do I have to say everything?
[13:16] Yes. Its important to remind you because you often forget me.
[13:23] Like you forgot me after your wedding.
[13:26] Okay. I didn't know you thought this about me.
[13:29] Alright so I'm not supposed to even think and you do everything.
[13:34] Faizan, you getting married isn't something small.
[13:40] Where is your wife?
[13:41] I don't know. She was with me last night, I don't know now.
[13:47] What happened?
[13:50] Honestly, you girls cannot even hear any other girl's name. You get jealous.
[13:55] And you boys? You love someone else and get married to someone else, is that alright?
[14:08] Is your wife really beautiful?
[14:12] She is.
[14:15] More than me?
[14:18] Of course more than you.
[14:23] I haven't seen her properly.
[14:28] She isn't like you. She's not even stylish. She's very simple.
[14:34] You haven't even looked at her properly. She's simple, not stylish. How did you know that?
[14:42] Why are we talking about her? Lets talk about us.
[14:47] I married her because dad forced me.
[14:51] Nobody can take your place in my heart.
[14:57] Faizan, do you really love me so much?
[15:02] Of course. I love you. I cannot live without you.
[15:09] Faizan even I cannot live without you. I miss you very much.
[15:15] I'm coming to Pakistan on the next flight.
[15:18] No. You cannot do this.
[15:21] Listen! Dad's anger hasn't cooled down yet.
[15:26] You took the money and you insulted me in my parent's eyes. Not now.
[15:32] Faizan I told you I took that money because I was helpless otherwise I'm not interested in the money.
[15:38] I know, I get it but they don't understand
[15:42] and I have to do a few important things.
[15:45] What are those important things?
[15:51] Dad's business.
[15:53] Yes. The business is yours
[15:57] because he's your dad and he would want you to join his company and work with him.
[16:03] Yes but he wants to work through proper channel and I want to own the business.
[16:07] Faizan it shouldn't be hard for you. He's your father, he'll listen to you.
[16:15] You're absolutely right.
[16:18] Nothing is difficult for me.
[16:20] Faizan decide what you want to decide for me right away. I'm telling you, I cannot wait anymore.
[16:35] How did you like this dress?
[16:37] Very beautiful. Your choice is very good.
[16:41] See mom? I told you Hadia would love it.
[16:45] Has she ever pointed fault with any gifts she has received?
She always accepts them with her heart.
[16:53] My sister is so good.
[16:55] Of course she is. May God always keep her happy.
[17:00] Amen.
[17:01] Mom. Dad isn't back yet?
[17:04] Its been too long. He should have come by now. I'll go call him.
[17:09] He's here.
Hello dad.
[17:12] Hello dear. May you live long. Sit down.
[17:17] Dear, I cannot see Faizan. Where is he?
[17:28] Faizan didn't come.
[17:41] Dad please sit I'll get you tea.
[17:55] Nobody came Hadia's dad. You made me do so many arrangements.
[18:02] Hadia told us everybody was busy.
[18:07] They'll come some other time.
[18:09] Nobody came and trust me nobody will come in the future as well.
[18:15] Khadijah it was our duty to invite them.
[18:18] If they come or not, its their wish. I just wanted Faizan to come.
[18:27] He won't come as well. He would have come tomorrow if he wanted to come.
[18:33] Dear, there might be something...
[18:35] Stop it dad.
[18:37] At least don't give yourself false hope. We all know why Hadia came alone.
[18:44] Because nobody wanted to come.
[18:47] Don't keep expectations in the future.
[18:50] Fizza is right.
[18:53] And listen to me as well.
[18:56] We will get Fizza married to people like us.
[19:00] Oh God mom. Why do you end everything on my marriage?
[19:03] I don't want to get married. I want to study and become a doctor.
[19:10] Dear, get good marks in FSC and then you'll go to a medical college.
Yes.
[19:16] My result is coming in two days. You'll know because I'll top in the college. You'll see. As God wills.
[19:25] Look at your daughter's confidence.
So?
[19:30] I love my daughter's attitude
[19:34] and not only she, but even I also believe, she'll top in her college.
[19:41] But I'm worried.
[19:45] She wants to study medicine and it takes five years 
[19:51] and we don't have a good college in Hyderabad. Where will she go?
[19:57] We have Jamshoro as well but I will send my daughter to the best university in Karachi.
[20:07] But where will she live?
[20:13] Will you send her to Hadia?
[20:16] No. Its not feasible for a sister to live with her sister's in laws.
[20:26] She can live in a hostel. 
[20:29] There are hundreds of other girls in a hostel 
[20:32] and I completely trust my daughter, more than myself.
[20:47] Please have your tea. It'll get cold.
[20:52] Please have your tea.
thank you!
[20:55] you haven't brought for yourself?
I don't feel like it.
[21:03] Fariya got married Natasha, what is your plan?
[21:07] What does she care, she has a line of proposals.
[21:12] This is the problem. She has so many suitors she'll need a lifetime to find someone.
[21:20] What should I tell you? My father wants me to get married to his nephew?
[21:28] How is he?
[21:33] Don't tell me. Is he so bad?
[21:37] Not bad but he isn't from my class.
[21:41] He's so poor and nerdy. He's not my type.
[21:46] So how is your type?
[22:24] Where are you lost?
[22:31] Nowhere. I'm saying, lets go somewhere else. How long will we stay here? 
[22:42] Lets go.
[23:44] Yes. Okay love. Will talk to you later. Bye.
[23:52] You should knock before you come in.
[23:54] This is my room too. Should I knock before I come in?
[24:02] You're very confident.
[24:05]  I didn't know. Good! Impressive.
[24:11] You came back early?
[24:14] Do you not like me coming back early? 
[24:18] Maybe I disturbed you.
[24:22] You were talking to some girl.
[24:31] Yes she was my girlfriend. Do you have an objection?
[24:39] If you liked someone else, you shouldn't have married me.
[24:43] I said she's my girlfriend and I can have a girlfriend.
[24:48] I know you didn't want to marry me.
[24:54] I heard auntie talking to uncle that you were forced into this marriage. You aren't happy.
[25:00] Yes. I was forced and who doesn't want to marry someone they like.
[25:08] But you aren't bad. You're good.
[25:15]  I'm telling you clearly that I have a girlfriend 
[25:18] but I don't have any affair so you shouldn't be doubting me.
[25:30] What happened? Why are you looking at me like this? 
[25:33] Did you not have any boyfriend?
[25:35] No. I did not have any relationship.
[25:42] Unbelievable. I cannot believe this. 
[25:45] Maybe you didn't tell anyone but you might have one.
[25:48] What are you saying?
[25:51] Exactly what you're saying.
[26:02] Don't question me next time. I don't like it. 
[26:07] Have I ever asked you what you did before you got married?
[26:59] You came back very early. 
[27:02] Its only 11 o clock.
[27:04] Whats your problem? I told my parents I was going to a birthday party and I'd get late.
[27:11] Birthday party? 
[27:14] Sitting in the parking area and smoking with your friends. Is that a party for you? 
[27:20] Is it some new trend?
[27:22] I heard it the first time.
[27:24] Who are you to question me?
[27:30] I am not interested to be linked to you in any way.
[27:37] I'm warning you for the last time. Stop spying on me or else it'll not be good for you.
[27:43] I'm not spying on you Natasha.
[27:47] I don't have the time or interest in any such thing
[27:52]  I just want to tell you to stay away from those people.
[27:56] Get rid of smoking and your cheap friends. Its for your best.
[27:59] Don't say a word about my friends. Understood?
[28:06] Alright. 
[28:08] It was my duty as your cousin to make you understand but 
[28:12] its your life, your decision.
[28:42] Yes, I was forced into this marriage and who doesn't want to marry someone they like.
[29:08] And yet let me tell you that I have a girlfriend 
[29:11] but since I don't have an affairs you don't have to doubt me.
[29:24] Don't question me again. I don't like it. 
[29:30] Did I ever ask you what you did before we got married?
[29:44] Razi dear, Faizan is under you.
[29:49]  You should teach him all the techniques of business. 
[29:53] I want him to be perfect like you.
[30:00] And Faizan dear, you will learn work under Razi from today.
[30:05] I will not work under him. Its an insult to me.
[30:10] What do you mean? 
[30:12] Dear you don't know anything about the business.
What does he know?
[30:18] He was an ordinary clerk earlier.
[30:22] Uncle, I think you should give this responsibility of Mr. Sarfaraz. 
[30:28] As it is,
[30:30] I will be uncomfortable with Faizan because of his behavior.
[30:35] You should just stay relaxed dear. 
[30:38] As far as Faizan is concerned, he doesn't know anything about business.
[30:44] If you guide him he'll learn better.
[30:48]  If he keeps on doing this, it will be problematic for the company and himself as well. You...
[30:53] I know him very well.
[30:55] He is innocent and he turns you against me.
[30:58] What is this way Faizan? Sit down and talk like a respectful man.
[31:03] I will not work under him and that is it.
[31:06] What difference does it make? You have to work under someone to learn. 
[31:13] What is the matter? He is your cousin after all.
[31:17] No.
[31:19] What are you saying? He isn't a stranger but your cousin. 
[31:23] I want you people to work together to achieve something.
[31:30] Uncle, please, I'm really sorry. I think I should head back to my seat. 
[31:38] Faizan will be more comfortable with you alone.
[31:45] Have some shame. 
[31:47] Is this how you talk to family? 
[31:50] He's not a stranger but your cousin.
[31:53] Do you know how was the DHA branch? 
[31:55] He made it flourish in two months because of his capability and you!
[32:01] What am I thinking, what is he thinking and what you're thinking! 
[32:05] I thought I'd give you a branch to take care of but your attitude,
[32:11] its important to take a course and work under someone to learn hotel management but you... Please leave!
[33:20] This is our cash counter. We normally deal here. 
[33:29] Its manual and computerized as well. 
[33:33] You don't have to sit here but inquire.
[33:40] Come. I'll give you further details. Come.
[34:13] Mrs. Rehman is the limit.
[34:17] Mom, please don't take her name in front of me. 
[34:20] You were so excited and what happened?!
[34:24] She liked Hadia's sister, that classless girl, Fizza.
[34:32] And if dad can make Hadia his daughter in law, why can't they chose Fizza?
[34:38] Not everybody is stupid like your father. They will open their eyes once they see their true face.
[34:44] If we got trapped, it doesn't mean everybody will be trapped.
[34:48] Mom, don't placate me.
[34:52] We got to know her class there and then. Did you see her dress? 
[34:56] That girl has no dressing sense and Mrs. Rehman couldn't stop looking at her.
[35:03] I'm telling you, this Mrs. Rehman is such a conservative woman. 
[35:08] You must be so disappointed.
[35:12] I? Disappointed? 
[35:15] Nothing this small disappoints me.
[35:18]  Dear I know this likeness at first sight is never permanent.
[35:25] Oh God. You mean you will still stalk Mrs. Rehman?
[35:33] Natasha I'm telling you. I like that boy for you. 
[35:38] He's good looking, he earns good. He's educated and has a good standard. He works in America.
[35:45] He is the perfect candidate for you 
[35:48] and you'll see I'll get you married to him. 
[35:53] Forget that David.
[35:55] Mom, don't worry about David.
[35:59] You might not know, David and I broke up a few days ago.
[36:05] Are you telling the truth or just trying to put me off?
[36:10] No mom. You were right. 
[36:13] Its difficult for people from different cultures to match. 
[36:16] We couldn't live together.
[36:21]  You and dad were right.
[36:27] I made a mistake. I was wrong.
[36:31] At least you understood what your dad and I said. 
[36:36] Now don't contact David again.
[36:40] Yes.
[37:36] Tell me, you're alone...
Mom, where is dad?
[37:41] They went to the market to get something for you. He'll come after prayers.
[37:44] He'll ask the same question, you stopped mom from asking.
[37:50] You've started hiding things from us.
[38:03] Unbelievable. I cannot believe you didn't have a boyfriend. 
[38:07] Perhaps not in the open but in secret.
[38:10] What are you saying?
[38:13] Exactly what you're saying.
[38:31] Are you crying?
[38:36] I was just missing mom and dad.
[38:43] You said and I believed you.
[38:48] What do you mean?
[38:49] I mean you have such a big house, an army of servants and all the luxuries in your life and yet you're crying.
[39:00] Anybody other than me would question.
[39:04] What are you trying to say?
[39:07] I mean to say that you're ungratefulness will make everybody think you're not happy in this marriage.
[39:17] Its not that.
[39:20] How can I believe that?
[39:23] Why are you stressing on something imaginary. 
[39:26] You should make Faizan understand. His girlfriend.
[39:29] How dare you say something about Faizan!
[39:37] He has a lot of friends. 
[39:39] He was brought up in America and he's an open minded man. 
[39:44] If you try to bind his thoughts, you'll tire yourself out.
[39:49] But this isn't right. You should have taken his consent.
[39:54] Children play with a lot of toys 
[39:57] and then they throw them away once they're done.
[40:02] Does this mean we should stop the child from playing?
