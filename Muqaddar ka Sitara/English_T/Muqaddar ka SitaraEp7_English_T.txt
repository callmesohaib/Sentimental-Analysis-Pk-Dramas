[01:36] Who can it be so late at night?
Lord knows who it is.
[01:42] Let me check.
Be careful.
[01:47] Sure...
[02:11] Safdar?
[02:14] Sister Shina...
[02:22] Come in... come in.
[02:32] It makes me very happy to see this.
[02:37] You guys are preparing for the wedding. I just saw everything.
[02:41] We're making similar arrangements.
[02:45] He's our only son and we don't want to miss anything.
[02:59] I understand why you're worried.
[03:03] That day Faizan...
We're not just worried...
[03:08] Looking at Faizan and meeting him has snatched away our sleep.
[03:13] I don't understand how our simple girl will live in your home.
[03:21] You didn't do right by deceiving us.
Please brother Aleem...
[03:28] Let her talk and say whatever she wants. It's her right.
[03:35] Let her question us and express her emotions. Speak whatever there is in your heart.
[03:43] You kept us in the dark.
[03:46] Is this any way to fix your child's marriage?
[03:52] I was always suspicious.
This is how boys are at this age.
[03:58] You should be thankful...
[04:00] that your daughter is getting a son-in-law who is handsome, educated, and has an American passport.
[04:07] Girls yearn to marry guys like Faizan.
[04:12] I'm surprised that you're ungrateful, you should be thankful to us.
[04:18] What are you saying... we didn't do them any favors, rather...
[04:24] they are the ones who have done us a favor.
[04:32] They gave us the relationship of a girl like Hadia.
[04:35] All my life I will never forget this.
We are helpless.
[04:42] All the invitations have been sent out to our extended family.
[04:47] We...
[04:50] don't have any way to save our honor.
[05:02] You didn't do right by us.
[05:08] You're right.
[05:11] You're right to be upset.
[05:14] There is truth in what you say. Both of their personalities don't match, I know that.
[05:20] But, at this age, this is how boys are... when they are burdened with responsibility...
[05:28] they get better.
[05:30] Apart from this, believe me, there is nothing wrong with Faizan.
[05:37] Whatever flaws there are in my son's personality will vanish when Hadia comes into his life...
[05:43] I believe that.
[05:49] The thing is that we not only have a difference in status...
[06:00] there are big differences in a lot of things. 
[06:03] Our daughter can never be happy in your home.
[06:11] Come, my dear.
Greetings*
[06:17] How are you, my dear?
I'm good.
[06:22] My dear, I am a fan of your tea. I'm happy that I'll be getting your tea daily, very soon.
[07:10] Leave it be my dear. I'll serve it, you can go.
[07:15] Sure.
[07:22] Brother, we said what we wanted to say.
[07:28] Please...
[07:30] enough, why are you making it worse?
[07:35] Did you not see what Hadia was going through?
[07:39] Please... if you break off the relationship a few days before the wedding, over something trivial...
[07:46] then what effect will that have on your daughter?
[07:48] It will have a very bad effect. It's very hard to find good households to marry into nowadays.
[07:56] Please I request you...
Will she be able to stay happy marrying the wrong person?
[08:06] She should stay at her parent's home.
[08:14] Maybe in a few years, but we'll be able to find a good proposal.
[08:19] Nothing is absolute.
[08:27] We are honest people.
[08:30] People know who we are.
[08:33] Honest people don't back on their word as well.
[08:37] We are the groom's family and nothing bad will happen to us...
[08:42] But if the girl's relationship breaks off, then people are bound to pose questions.
[08:51] Shina, please...
[08:54] Don't add to their worries.
[08:58] Brother Aleem...
[09:02] I guarantee you...
[09:05] God willing, it won't be like how sister is thinking.
[09:10] I admit that my son is a little rude, but that's because he isn't aware of the culture here.
[09:21] With time, he will mature.
[09:25] Please.
[09:27] Please don't refuse altogether.
[09:31] I request you two, please...
[10:05] Why did mother say that?
[10:09] Why does she want to end this relationship all of a sudden?
[10:14] Faizan isn't at all like how his mother said he is.
[10:21] Sister... why are you standing here? Your in-laws are leaving, don't you want to greet them? Come on...
[10:31] What happened, why are you crying?
[10:34] You're not going anywhere today, there is still a lot of time left.
[10:40] And, what are you worried about? After the wedding, I'll come on every weekend to stay with you and you can come here as well.
[10:48] Enough, stop crying.
[10:56] Mother, look at her... she's already crying. I told her that there is still a lot of time before her leaving.
[11:03] Go outside, I want to talk to her.
[11:07] Sure.
[11:15] Hadia I know...
[11:17] you are hurt by what I said.
[11:21] But we are your parents.
[11:24] It's our responsibility to think good for you.
[11:27] We are the ones who can take the right decisions for you.
[11:30] We will not think anything bad for you.
Faizan isn't like that.
[11:33] How much do you know about him?
[11:41] But, won't this defame us?
Do you think...
[11:48] we're not aware of this?
Then why?
[11:51] We are concerned for your happiness more than we are concerned for our defamation.
[12:20] Why don't you call my brother and his wife?
[12:24] Ask them to have breakfast.
[12:31] What need was there to leave for Hyderabad so late at night?
[12:34] I think they went there to apologize for Faizan's behavior.
[12:40] I think they will refuse because brother Faizan was very rude.
[12:45] Don't make opinions on your own.
[12:49] Think about it mother.
[12:52] Why would someone give their honorable daughter to a characterless man? Not everyone is that greedy.
[12:59] Besides, uncle and auntie have seen how brother Faizan behaves.
[13:09] Why are you so happy?
[13:14] I'm not happy.
[13:17] I know that my uncle will be able to convince him.
[13:26] There is no doubt that they are greedy... but...
[13:30] Wealth can cover up even the greatest of flaws.
[13:36] Whatever it may be...
[13:39] I'm praying that they refuse.
[13:45] Farwa, why do you speak nonsense and bother your brother? Listen to my Razi...
[13:52] Even if they refuse, you can't marry there.
[13:58] That's because we stay in the same house. You said that girl loved you right?
[14:05] That she was always on the phone with you, then what happened that she agreed to marry you?
[14:13] My dear, I think you had a misunderstanding...
[14:17] or maybe seeing all the wealth she got greedy.
[14:24] No Hadia isn't like that.
Oh really! Like you know what sheâ€™s really like.
[14:29] Don't give me explanations.
Greetings*
[14:35] What is the matter, Safdar? Was everything alright?
Thank God.
[14:42] Actually, Hadia's parents had some worries...
[14:49] Not only did we clear them up, but we also assured them.
[14:53] It's obvious that it's a matter of their daughter's honor.
[14:57] Maybe they won't accept it, but if the relationship had ended they would have to face humiliation.
[15:13] My dear, why the long face? Your brother is getting married.
[15:17] Invite your friends and have a good time.
[15:22] You know Natasha doesn't have a friend circle, this way she'll find some friends.
[15:29] Sure, uncle.
[15:30] Sister, if you want you can invite your friends as well.
[15:37] Razi you too.
[15:40] Uh...
[15:42] Uncle, I don't have friends. There was one, he got married and went to the UK.
[15:50] Alright, no matter. At least there should be some noise in the house.
[15:55] Let's start eating.
[16:05] It was such a good opportunity. You would have gotten rid of that useless girl.
[16:10] But mother and father talked to them and convinced them.
[16:15] They already agreed. They were just being dramatic to show their importance.
[16:22] People from their class do these things...
[16:26] Look at me, will they refuse me just because I'm rude? I don't think so.
[16:34] Let that girl come here...
[16:38] You'll see what I'll do to her.
[16:41] What do you mean?
Four days...
[16:45] If she doesn't run away in four days, then you can change my name.
[16:55] Don't worry about Faizan, brother Aleem.
[17:01] I know that Faizan will change after he marries Hadia.
[17:07] I guarantee you that.
Khadija was very disturbed because of Faizan's behavior.
[17:16] She was afraid of certain things, but they have gone away now.
[17:24] I apologize on Faizan's behalf.
[17:28] Don't embarrass me by apologizing again and again.
[17:32] We are old friends and these things hold no importance.
[17:38] It's a matter of our daughter...
[17:42] that's why we were a little worried.
[17:46] No need to worry, believe me, I'm bringing Hadia...
[17:54] here as my daughter. I will try that she doesn't have any pain here.
[18:01] It will be my wish to fulfill all of her desires.
I know that Safdar.
[18:07] I know that you will take good care of my daughter...
[18:11] Make sure that Faizan will take care of her similarly.
God willing, it will be that way.
[18:20] Brother Aleem, I wanted to talk to you about something.
[18:23] I was wondering if the mehndi function could be combined with us here
[18:33] Uh...
[18:37] Safdar...
[18:41] I'll talk it over and let you know.
No problem with that...
[18:47] Alright... farewell.
[19:14] Uh...
[19:16] Safdar called.
[19:21] Forget everything...
[19:25] and pray to God that he doesn't test Hadia.
What was he saying?
[19:32] He was assuring me and apologized.
[19:37] He promised that...
[19:41] he will not any sorrow enter Hadia's life.
[19:49] And he was always saying that Faizan will change after marriage.
[19:55] Habits might change...
[19:58] but what if the problem is in his blood?
God forbid... what are you saying?
[20:05] He's Safdar's son...
He's sister Shina's son as well.
[20:11] It's not set in stone that only daughters are like their mothers. Sons can be like their mothers too.
[20:17] You're well aware of sister Shina's habits. An honorable man like brother Safdar couldn't change her.
[20:24] Will Hadia be able to change their manner less son?
[20:31] Leave it be Khadija...
I am silent...
[20:35] Silently I'm pushing my daughter into the fire.
[20:39] What else do you want me to do? 
[20:41] Do you not want me to cry?
[20:48] Why don't you admit that we've made the wrong decision... we've made a mistake.
[20:56] Not us, you... you are the one who has made a mistake.
[21:01] I told you so many times...
[21:06] I say there is still time.
[21:10] I don't care about anything. I don't care if we get defamed.
[21:17] Think about it...
[21:20] He was asking to arrange a combined mehndi function at this house.
[21:28] He was requesting... he was saying that he'll look after the arrangements and...
[21:36] we will send a car for us...
Before the wedding?
[21:44] The times have changed...
[21:49] Circumstances have changed...
[21:55] These things don't matter when one is celebrating. It's not like Hadia is going alone.
[22:03] We'll be with her.... and there will be guests with us as well.
[22:10] It's not good to be critical of everything.
[22:16] We should listen to some of their points as well.
We've listened to everything they've said.
[22:21] What else should we listen to?
[22:24] You've already said yes, that's why you're trying to convince me.
[22:31] When you've already said yes...
[22:35] then what's the point in me agreeing or not?
[22:39] Alright...
[22:42] Whatever you want.
[23:30] Mother and father were telling me that your mehndi function will be combined with brother Faizan and will be hosted at uncle Safdar's house.
[23:37] We'll have so much fun. Mother was saying that they'll send cars for our guests as well.
[23:43] Wow... that's very good. I was thinking of taking all of my friends.
[23:49] We practiced our dance steps in secret as well. We'll have a great time.
[23:56] One of my friends was saying... sister...
[24:02] Are you listening to me?
[24:05] What is the matter? You look disturbed, is everything alright?
I don't know, I feel worried.
[24:12] It seems that something bad is about to happen.
God forbid that happens.
[24:18] God forbid anything like that happens. God willing everything will go well.
[24:24] If you keep up that face of yours, you won't have any good pictures at the wedding.
[24:45] A place will be made for Hadia in Faizan's heart.
[24:49] And our son Faizan will accept her.
[24:54] I don't think it will make any difference to him.
[24:57] You know Faizan, he will not accept Hadia.
[25:02] He will have to.
[25:04]  It's hard to find kind and honorable girls like her nowadays.
[25:10] I'm bringing her here as my daughter and if your son does anything untoward to her...
[25:16] then there will be none worse than me.
[25:19] Hadia hasn't arrived here and already she has bewitched him.
[25:25] Listen, I've transferred money into your account.
[25:30] Buy some things for Hadia, there should be no shortage of anything.
[25:37] Alright, let me check in on Natasha.
[25:43] Come and sit sister. I wanted to talk to you.
[25:48] What is it, Safdar?
I...
[25:53] I am hosting a combined mehndi function for the kids.
[25:56] Really... that's very good.
[25:59] Thank God for that...
[26:03] Shina is doing everything,
[26:06] but you know there are lots of other arrangements and I don't think she'll be able to do it.
[26:13] If you think it's appropriate, please help her out.
[26:16] Safdar, what are you saying? Why not? I'll help with everything.
[26:22] I'll ask Razi to monitor all the wedding arrangements.
[26:26] You have eased my burden... I needed Razi...
[26:32] Where is he by the way?
[26:37] He's in his room.
[26:43] David, you need to stop worrying about it. I've told you a thousand times...
[26:49] My future there with you in America, I'm gonna be there soon.
[26:54] Yes, I did apply for the new passport, it will be here in the next ten to fifteen days, I guess.
[27:01] Well, I do not care about my father.
[27:05] He doesn't care about my feeling, then why should I care about him?
[27:12] I miss you too David.
Hang up the phone, I want to talk to you.
[27:20] David, can I call you back in a minute.
[27:24] Yeah...
[27:25] I'm gonna call you back, take care... bye.
[27:31] That man still hasn't let go of you
What seems to be the problem?
[27:36] Why are you disturbing me?
I thought your affair with that man would have been over by now.
[27:41] If your father finds out it will be very bad.
[27:46] Mother, it's impossible... if father hadn't burned my passport, I would have been long gone.
[27:51] Just shut up! You know that I don't like that guy, I don't want you talking to him in the future.
[27:59] When did you get so conservative like father?
You know you can't marry David. It will make a mockery out of us!
[28:11] Oh my God... wait a second. Since when have you started caring about people?
[28:16] What difference does it make between what the people say and what they don't?
[28:19]  I'll go there, court marry him and that will be it.
[28:23] Don't you dare think of that.... if you even try to take such a step, it will be very bad.
[28:32] Okay, mom, I'm not doing anything right now, so relax and let me be.
Get up...
[28:38] Get and get ready. I have to go shopping with you.
[28:42] Why do you have to go shopping?
[28:44] Maybe you're forgetting that Faizan is getting married. Your father has given me money to shop for her.
[28:50] Why do we need to shop for that two-bit girl?
[28:57] Don't forget that girl is a soon-to-be daughter-in-law of Safdar Kamal.
[29:04] I will shop according to her worth. But my real intention is to shop for you and me.
[29:12] We have invited Safdar's close friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rehman to the wedding.
[29:18] Their son Nisar is a practicing doctor and he's a surgeon at a huge hospital in America.
[29:25] I want Mrs. Rehman to choose you for her son.
[29:29] I cannot... not right now...
[29:32] I just explained to you that I like David and I want to marry him.
You know very well that David can't give you anything...
[29:43] Marrying Nisar means that you'll play with millions.
[29:47] Mother, I have no shortage of money. I already have so much money.
[29:52] And... in my life...
Enough... I don't want to hear childish things.
[30:01] I want you to get ready within fifteen minutes! Understand?
[30:17] All of you, come to my home. I've taken mother's permission. 
[30:21] I've been calling Rumaisa for ages, but she isn't picking up, bring her with you.
[30:27] Alright, I'm going to get ready. Hurry up.. be here quickly.
Who are you inviting?
[30:33] Why?
Because it's your dholki...
[30:37] What?
Does it seem like there's going to be a wedding... there's no noise
[30:43] I've invited everyone in the evening. 
[30:46] We'll dance and have a good time, so that everyone may know that there is a marriage incoming soon.
[30:50] There is a mehndi incoming soon... you can enjoy yourself soon.
We'll be going to Karachi and I don't how that will be.
[30:59] Let me enjoy myself here, please.
What need was there for you to do this?
[31:05] Sister, I've already talked to my friends, all you have to do is get ready.
[31:12] I feel anxious, I'm not getting ready.
[31:17] So what... I'm in the mood.
[31:20] I wanted to enjoy myself at my sister's wedding and you're here feeling anxious.
[31:25] Go on and get ready... dress well, all of my friends are coming.
[31:30] What do you think about this?
[31:35] Mom, please... Faizan is the one who's getting married, go and ask him.
[31:42] What are you saying, what does Faizan know?
[31:45] We've got this for the bride. I won't buy new jewelry for Hadia.
[31:50] I decided to give her a few from this...
[31:54] But I don't feel like giving her anything from my set.
[31:58] Won't father know if you give her from one of your sets?
[32:03] Like your father remembers.
[32:07] Shina... Safdar said that...
[32:11] Come sit sister.
By God's good grace it looks beautiful...
[32:16] All of this is for Hadia?
What are you saying, sister?
[32:21] Do you think I'll give these sets of mine to her? They are made of diamonds, gold, and white gold.
[32:28] I was just thinking of giving her a few of these.
[32:32] Each set of mine is of six tolas. Are fifteen tolas not enough?
[32:40] Sure, you're right. Can't you make up your mind on which one to give her?
[32:44] Yes, I can't make up my mind. I love all of my sets, I don't feel like giving her any one of these.
[32:53] Which one is my mother's set? The one which is our family heirloom.
[32:59] This is not the one. Thanks for reminding me, I'll give that one to her.
[33:06] It was an old-fashioned set, I'll give it to her.
[33:11] And, Natasha tells me about this one.
[33:15] Please, whatever! So whatever you want.
[33:20] You are useless. You don't help at all.
[33:54] I don't know why mother is upset at Faizan. Why isn't she happy with my wedding to him?
[34:01] If she didn't like him, then why did she agree?
[34:28] Razi, your uncle needs you right now. How can you run away from your responsibilities?
[34:34] You don't understand my emotions. I don't want to face Hadia.
[34:41] It would be better if you let me go to my friend's house.
[34:45] How can you forget your uncle's favors?
[34:51] Sometimes were are so forced that we become helpless.
[34:55] It puts an end to all emotions...
[35:02] Please keep my respect and do as I say...
[35:07] Tomorrow we have the mehndi function and I've told your uncle...
[35:11] that you'll handle all the arrangements. Please listen to me.
[35:19] It's very hard mother...
Razi, listen to me.
[35:25] Alright... meaning they'll be here by the evening...
[35:31] Okay...
[35:33] Alright, thank you. Razi, brother Aleem will be here in a few hours.
[35:43] Look after the banquet affairs, I'll go and meet the caterers.
[35:48] Sure, uncle...
[35:51] Bless you...
[35:55] Hello... yes?
[36:41] My dear... why aren't you ready yet?
[36:46] What should I get ready for?
[36:49] You have your mehndi today. Guests are at the hall and Hadia's parents will be there soon as well.
[36:56] It's your celebration, what will I do there?
[37:00] What do you mean? You're the groom and today is your mehndi.
[37:06] Come on! All of these suit women... I'm not interested.
[37:14] People do this out of happiness...
[37:19] This is our ritual. People find happiness in them.
[37:27] For God's sake, don't create a mess...
[37:33] It's just a matter of a few days... after that, I won't say anything to you...
[37:38] Faizan, your shalwar kameez is hanging in your room. Go and wear it.
[37:45] Excuse me?
[37:48] Kurta shalwar? Out of the question!
[37:54] I can't wear a kurta shalwar. No one will ask me to dance and no one will ask me to put on the mehndi...
[38:01] I won't partake in any ritual.
Sure don't do all of that.
[38:09] But please go and get ready, we're already very late.
Okay...
[38:15] But I'll go like this... do you accept it or not?
[38:21] Alright...
[38:24] Come on.
[38:36] At least you get ready...
[38:39] All I have to do is make my hair and put on jewelry. I came here to check on him.
[38:43] Alright... please.
[38:47] Her and her son
[38:50] Hello!
[39:02] Many congratulations!
[39:05] Same to you...
Bless you!
[39:17] Greetings*
Is everyone well?
[39:26] By God's good grace Hadia is getting married into a rich family. May God make every daughter's fate like hers.
[39:36] Let me know if you need anything.
