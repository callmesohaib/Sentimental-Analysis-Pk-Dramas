[01:13] Mother?
[01:15] Do you know?
[01:16] People are coming for Farwa's proposal?
[01:19] Your father did tell me
[01:23] I'm amazed at your auntie
[01:25] I mean this all happened secretly. They have fixed Farwa's proposal and informed me like strangers.
[01:33] and I'm shocked that how did that Farwa get such a rich and decent family?
[01:42] Mother, how does it matter?
[01:43] It does. By getting her married in such wealthy family, she just wants to compete with us. Nothing else
[01:50] No, mother
[01:52] Auntie isn't like this. She doesn't care about wealth
[01:57] enough Natasha!
[01:59] Its useless to talk to you
[02:01] Leave it mother. Do you know, I'm so excited. Such event is happening at home after long
[02:07] I'm not happy at all. Neither I have any interest in getting involved
[02:12] what do you mean?
[02:14] If you won't be there
[02:16] what will we tell people? Auntie won't like it, mother ...
[02:19] Let her. Do you think I care if she won't like it? Also, I think you have forgotten what did her son say about you.
[02:30] mother, Raazi and I both have forgotten that
[02:35] Its better if you too forget it
[02:39] Never
[02:40] I will never forget it
[02:42] Both these mother and son are very clever. I know that this was their planning. First, they manipulated your father, and now they manipulated you.
[02:54] mother please, don't involve Raazi in this matter unreasonably
[02:59] As far as auntie is concerned, she did what father asked her
[03:04] Natasha, I had it
[03:06] Its enough. You keep siding with them in everything and call me wrong
[03:11] mother, it isn't like that
[03:13] you are exaggerating things
[03:16] auntie just expressed a wish for us to participate in her happiness. That's it
[03:21] I don't want to participate. Understood?
[03:24] Mother, what are you saying?
[03:26] If you won't be there. Everyone would ask about you. What would we say?
[03:29] Make some excuse. I don't care. Tell them that I was busy
[03:35] and yes ..
[03:37] there is no need to get free with them. Understood?
[03:41] Mother, please listen to me. If they ..
[03:47] If I won't convince mother then Raazi won't like it. I can't do this
[04:03] hello?
[04:04] Greetings Mrs. Rehman. How are you?
[04:07] Greetings! I'm fine. You tell?
[04:11] What do I tell you? I'm too embarrassed. Whatever Fizza did, I wasn't able to talk to you
[04:19] no! leave it. When relation has ended, it is useless to talk about it
[04:24] Absolutely! But it was essential to talk to you. After all, you chose them because of us
[04:32] no! you don't need to be embarrassed
[04:35] you were still fortunate. It was just an engagement. But we have got the elder one married to our son
[04:41] we are trapped badly
[04:44] Look Sheena, don't ruin your relationship with your daughter in law because of us
[04:49] your daughter in law ..
[04:50] what? Leave it. She is like Fizza
[04:55] Sheena, if you don't mind can we talk later?
[04:59] Actually, I have some guests at home
[05:02] yes absolutely! No problem. Infact, I'd visit you some day
[05:07] yes!
[05:09] okay bye!
[05:12] bye!
[05:42] listen?
[05:44] yes?
[05:45] Did Fizza have breakfast?
[05:51] no!
[05:55] She isn't eating anything. She is lost
[06:02] where is she?
[06:06] in her room
[06:10] okay ..
[06:12] I'll go check her
[06:14] you bring breakfast
[06:17] yes
[06:54] Fizza, my child
[06:58] yes father?
[07:01] my child ..
[07:02] didn't you have breakfast?
[07:06] umm
[07:08] I wasn't hungry
[07:11] my child, what is this?
[07:14] look
[07:15] no matter how much a person is worried. He can't live without food.
[07:24] so why are you angry at food?
[07:29] also ..
[07:31] if you won't eat 
[07:34] then how would I be able to eat?
[07:41] Come on ..
[07:44] come my child, lets have breakfast together
[08:06] hello!
[08:06] Well done! The work is done nicely
[08:12] so, when are you giving me my prize?
[08:13] very soon
[08:15] listen, I was thinking if you can go out of city for few days
[08:21] but why?
[08:23] just like that ..
[08:26] what do you mean?
[08:29] Do I have some risk?
[08:32] O no! what risk .. her father is a very simple person. He's hiding from people. He can't harm you
[08:39] I was saying just like that
[08:41] then why would I leave the city?
[08:45] Actually, the girl is very clever
[08:49] what if she takes your name in college?
[08:52] she'll try to expose you. I was saying it for your reputation but if you don't feel it necessary then it doesn't matter
[09:02] I don't think so she'd come back to university
[09:04] forget complaining. Also, if she'd take my name, she'll ruin her own reputation too
[09:11] hmm .. you are right though
[09:14] you will get your prize soon
[09:18] I really liked working with you
[09:21] okay bye!
[09:26] so you did this all, mother?
[09:32] Natasha? I ..
[09:34] I don't believe it, you can stoop this low?
[09:38] you insulted her in front of everyone. Her parents were too embarrassed
[09:45] you broke her engagement. It was you behind this all?
[09:49] How do I believe that my mother can do this all
[09:53] Don't get disheartened. Sit with me and listen to me. I did this all for you
[10:00] what do you mean, for me?
[10:03] Those people rejected you and chose Fizza. You were so hurt
[10:09] I did this to take revenge
[10:12] mother please, don't involve me in your sin
[10:16] I was hurt but I never thought about it. Did I ask you that I would do something wrong if I won't get Nissar? No right?
[10:25] then why did you do this all?
[10:27] you ruined her life
[10:29] Natasha, you are forgetting
[10:31] you were very disheartened. This is why you got married to that rowdy Sherry
[10:37] You were in too much pain. Not just you, I was also in pain. We had to hear many taunts
[10:45] Your father taunted me a lot about you. I couldn't tolerate this all. I was going in depression
[10:52] and this is the solution your found about your depression?
[10:56] Did you know any better and skillful guy in your social circle than Nissar with whom you could get me married. That was a better decision, mother
[11:06] You should have got me married. But, what did you do?
[11:11] you broke her engagement and humiliated her
[11:15] you didn't leave her capable of facing anyone
[11:19] Natasha, don't exaggerate things. It was just an engagement
[11:22] mother, those people just refused my proposal
[11:26] then didn't reject me. They didn't choose me and then leave me or Fizza didn't snatch Nissar from me
[11:33] That poor girl doesn't have any idea
[11:36] Natasha, don't be angry. Think with a cool mind. Its not a big deal. That Nissar would find another girl a lot better than Fizza
[11:46] and Fizza would find another guy too
[11:49] and what did you get?
[11:53] I found peace. First, that Hadia entered my house and then her sister took my daughter's right
[12:02] both sisters ruined my children life. I couldn't tolerate it
[12:07] mother, Hadia is still here
[12:11] and I haven't got Nissar too. What peace are you talking about?
[12:17] You did wrong.
[12:33] Your sister is also like you
[12:38] what do you mean?
[12:40] I mean, you are also having an affair besides being married
[12:43] and she too ..
[12:45] enough Faizan
[12:47] don't say another word
[12:51] nothing good can happen
[12:56] you are not in my heart anymore
[12:58] the more you act pious
[13:02] actually, you are a cheater
[13:05] and you?
[13:06] aren't you betraying me? Do you think you live in my heart?
[13:12] All the respect and love has gone
[13:15] I'm helpless because of this child otherwise, I would have left you long ago for all the blames you have put on me
[14:01] what have you done, mother?
[14:04] I had started making place in Raazi's heart
[14:08] and mother, you?
[14:11] what if Raazi would find out the truth? He'd start hating mother and me too
[14:17] I can't lose Raazi
[14:21] I won't let Raazi go away from me
[14:24] what do I do?
[14:33] Natasha?
[14:34] Hadia madam is calling you
[14:37] okay, you go. I'm coming
[14:39] Yes!
[14:52] your sister is like you
[14:56] what do you mean?
[14:58] I mean you are also having an affair besides having a husband, and she too besides having a fiance ..
[15:07] Natasha, please keep the eye makeup light
[15:10] don't you worry, I will do such a good makeup that groom's family would say yes immediately
[15:17] don't blink eyes otherwise it would ruin your makeup
[15:21] Farwa, don't you worry. Natasha would do a wonderful job
[15:25] have you heard it?
[15:27] come on
[15:29] Girls, aren't you ready yet?
[15:32] Almost done, auntie
[15:34] I think they are here
[15:35] they are here
[15:37] one minute
[15:43] one minute
[15:45] now you are all set. Get ready for final round now
[15:48] Sister, look at her. She is annoying me
[15:51] Natasha, don't do it. And why are you tensed? Relax! Answer peacefully whatever they ask
[15:57] why are you tensed
[15:58] I'm too scared
[16:00] nothing would happen
[16:01] come on
[16:03] have this
[16:11] you look beautiful
[16:13] sister, you did good
[16:16] that you brought Hamza along
[16:18] actually
[16:19] Hamza's father had to go out of city for some work
[16:22] otherwise he really wanted to meet you
[16:27] umm
[16:29] sister, I want to say something to you
[16:32] sure!
[16:35] this house and wealth belongs to my brother
[16:40] After my husband's death, he raised and supported my children
[16:46] and the position my children are at today, is because of him
[16:51] what is the need of this, sister?
[16:54] its important, Safdar
[16:56] when you have to build relationships, it is good not to have misconception
[17:03] actually ..
[17:04] I had some doubts in my heart before coming here. But after seeing your love and sincerity I'm satisfied now
[17:14] People usually keep such things secret
[17:18] Sister, you are lucky that you have a daughter. A daughter is no less than any wealth
[17:24] Thanks to God. Sister, I think you should call Farwa
[17:29] yes, I'll bring her
[18:11] why are you calling me again and again and disturbing me?
[18:13] Look Fizza, I want to talk
[18:15] why? with what relation will you talk?
[18:19] I want to tell that I didn't end this engagement
[18:24] if you or anyone else, it doesn't matter
[18:28] Fizza please, meet me
[18:29] I want to talk to you
[18:31] Look, I didn't want to end this engagement
[18:33] Nissar, the engagement is broken. There is no relation between you and me now. Also, there is no reason to talk
[18:42] Look Fizza, I want to save this relation
[18:45] I will save it. Lets sit and talk
[18:49] but I don't want to keep this relation. I don't want to talk
[18:54] Also, where were you at the time when you should have come and talked to me and asked me my fault. But you .. 
[19:05] and your parents humiliated my parents
[19:10] insulted them
[19:12] infact, you saw a picture and broke the engagement without investigating it?
[19:16] this is why, now ..
[19:18] I don't want to keep any ties
[19:20] Also, don't call me again
[19:23] Fizza, listen ..
[20:19] Come
[20:20] Come my child
[20:22] Come
[20:25] come!
[20:26] this is our daughter 
[20:29] how are you my child?
[20:30] I'm fine
[20:32] how much have you studied?
[20:34] I'm in final year of honors
[20:37] what are you hobbies?
[20:41] hobbies? I read books ..
[20:44] cooking and baking. House chores ..
[20:57] wonderful!
[20:58] otherwise, girls these days have different interests. Isn't it brother Safdar?
[21:04] you are right
[21:07] I don't like to lie
[21:10] truth is in which ever house our daughter ..
[21:13] Farwa would go
[21:15] she will make that house beautiful
[21:17] Absolutely! Why not?
[21:19] Yes
[22:49] you ..
[22:53] are in lawn at this time?
[22:55] why? is there any time fixed?
[23:01] no, I mean .. are you fine?
[23:08] I'm fine. It would be better if you mind your own business
[23:18] I ..
[23:20] want number of that guy. Can you give it?
[23:24] I don't have it
[23:26] then ask Fizza 
[23:29] what is your problem?
[23:31] why are you so interested in our problems?
[23:37] you are considering it wrong
[23:40] Fizza is like my sister
[23:42] She is like your sister, but she isn't
[23:46] how does it matter
[23:47] it does. Many things matter a lot but you don't understand it or don't care
[23:53] you are standing here with me. This can matter a lot for someone
[23:58] at least think about my dignity
[24:02] this is my in laws house. People are joining our names and making stories. My husband taunts me about you day and night. My life has become hell
[24:12] shall I .. shall I bring water for you?
[24:15] no, I don't need anything. I just want you not to talk to me. Please! Go
[25:13] Greetings!
[25:15] Greetings, how are you?
[25:18] I'm fine
[25:21] I need his number
[25:24] Brother Raazi ..
[25:26] Now you'd say it doesn't matter. Why are you taking interest in my matter? its done now .. 
[25:34] Don't be foolish Fizza! I don't expect this from you
[25:41] Look Fizza, why did he do? Who was he and what was his purpose? It is important to know it, so tell me?
[25:54] Fizza, listen to me. For whatever he has done, doesn't he deserve a punishment?
[26:02] He harmed you. He ruined your image in front of people
[26:08] Hey, I'm not sad about your engagement. That Nissar also didn't deserve you. You will find many other guys like him
[26:16] but listen to me?
[26:18] Please, give me his details
[26:24] Fizza?
[26:28] Don't you worry
[26:29] Listen to me carefully
[26:32] There is nothing to be worried about. Trust me. I will wait and send me his number
[26:40] okay!
[26:41] okay!
[26:43] good!
[27:10] For how long will we keep Fizza at house?
[27:15] she has to go to university some day
[27:21] yes
[27:24] she will go to university
[27:30] but ..
[27:32] its better if she goes after some time
[27:42] I don't know
[27:44] what is the environment in university right now
[27:51] I don't know
[27:53] did that guy send us the pictures only ..
[27:58] or ..
[28:01] did he show them to others too
[28:08] after that ..
[28:09] who knows what is the reaction
[28:12] of her class fellows
[28:21] no!
[28:24] I don't want
[28:27] my daughter is have a bad influence
[28:40] for now let her study from home
[28:47] its better
[28:53] by the way
[28:56] there is another thing that is bothering me
[29:00] what is it?
[29:05] Hadia's father, not many people know about engagement right now
[29:13] but when they'd find out and they'll ask, what will we say? She has to get married
[29:27] God knows what kind of proposal would she get?
[29:33] look
[29:35] For now, we shouldn't mention it to anyone 
[29:46] if we won't talk
[29:50] no one will question
[29:55] also ..
[29:58] there were still 4 or 5 years left to get married to Nissar
[30:05] that's a long time
[30:13] Our God 
[30:15] will handle everything
[30:28] in this time, misconception of brother Abdul Rehman
[30:31] would go away
[30:38] No matter it the misconception is clear
[30:43] if they'll bring the proposal again
[30:46] then refuse them
[30:50] I know that a girl's dignity is more delicate than a glass and a little stain can make it blur
[31:02] but what's the fault of glass in it? Fault is of the people who make it dirty
[31:09] yes my child, but the world ..
[31:14] I don't care about the world
[31:17] If you both trust me then I don't care about the world
[31:23] you shouldn't too. Why are you waiting for someone?
[31:32] I am too concerned about my dignity
[31:35] and I won't give anyone a right ..
[31:38] to take decision of my life
[31:44] this right is only yours. And if someone if character assassinating your daughter then don't let him enter your house and send him away
[31:59] I will study. I will become doctor and make my career
[32:04] so that tomorrow if something happens, I face it firmly
[32:11] yes my child
[32:14] do make your career my child but it isn't everything. You have to get married in life too
[32:22] I'm not refusing to get married
[32:25] I will get married too but first I will make my career so that I can answer everyone
[32:33] for this, I only need you both and your trust
[32:40] please!
[32:46] fine my child ..
[33:11] Father, I'm going back from tomorrow's flight
[33:14] tomorrow? why? you still had time
[33:19] yes, I thought to stay for a month. But I'm going back
[33:25] but my child, why so early? Umair and Fatima are also getting married.
[33:30] I'm not interested in anyone's wedding
[33:33] my studies are effecting
[33:35] I know why you are doing this all? You want us to realize that we took a wrong decision
[33:42] I'm sorry father but I have objection regarding your decision
[33:47] my child, we broke this engagement after giving it a thought and its better for you
[33:52] you don't break engagements by only hearing things from others
[33:59] father, at least once
[34:01] you should have given chance to uncle and fizza. You should have talked to them. If they were proven guilty, I would have parted ways myself
[34:11] someone showed you 2 pictures ..
[34:15] we had no other choice
[34:18] Okay! I too don't have any option
[34:23] Nissar my child?
[34:31] listen?
[34:33] what if we took a wrong decision in rush?
[34:36] for once if we imagine that someone is conspiring against that girl, then we should think why ..
[34:43] why would he do this? what was the matter that he is forced to do this all?
[35:04] it might be possible ..
[35:06] that she has been trapped
[35:08] how do you know this?
[35:12] this is my idea and Raazi thinks the same
[35:26] why would someone do this?
[35:29] anyways, whoever he would be I will catch him
[35:46] hello?
[35:47] who?
[35:50] Fawad?
[35:51] have you changed your number?
[35:56] you have gone out of city?
[35:58] okay! That's good. yes, I will keep sending money
[36:06] And look, don't call me again now. Also, no one should know that you are out of city
[36:17] yes!
[36:19] Fine, okay!
[36:31] Did he call back?
[36:33] no, don't you remember? He said that he won't call from now but I would
[36:43] what kind of person is he? He has no idea that how many lives are suffering because of him
[36:51] what happened sister? Did something happen after we left? Did auntie Sheena say anything?
[36:58] no! no one said anything
[37:04] Thank God
[37:07] I was scared
[37:09] I don't want any trouble happen to you because of me
[37:13] Also sister, brother Faizan would have certainly asked. Did auntie Sheena say anything?
[37:20] He was very sad 
[37:24] If he was .. 
[37:27] then he would have visited to console us
[37:31] he didn't even call and ask. Look at brother Raazi, we have no relation with him but he's supporting us.
[37:40] he's helping us
[37:43] and brother Faizan
[37:45] he should be standing with father right now
[37:48] Father would have some hope. He would have thought that he has a son. I didn't expect this from brother Faizan. He didn't even say anything
[38:00] what is this?
[38:04] are you hearing?
[38:06] hello? sister? sister, are you crying?
[38:12] Sister, I'm so sorry. I didn't want to hurt you
[38:18] Faizan wanted to talk but I stopped him. I told him that father in tension so he shouldn't talk. He will. Don't you worry
[38:28] Faizan is with us
[38:33] yes sister!
[38:34] Did you talk to Nissar
[38:37] He did call but I refused to talk
[38:43] why?
[38:44] what's the use sister? When he should have, he didn't
[38:48] now he's calling again and again and asking to talk. I don't want to
[38:56] anyways, tell me?
[38:59] Did you find anything about Farwa?
[39:03] Yes, its under discussion. Things might be fixed
[39:08] fine sister! Take care. I'll talk later
[39:13] okay!
[39:15] bye!
