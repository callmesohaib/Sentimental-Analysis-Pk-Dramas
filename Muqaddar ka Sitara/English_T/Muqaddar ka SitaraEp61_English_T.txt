[05:36] Natasha died in a car accident
[05:42] oh God...
[05:46] dear, sister Sajida was telling that
[05:52] Faizan got arrested at the airport for money laundering
[06:03] Hadia, Faizan had done a second marriage secretly
[06:09] and maybe, that girl got him trapped
[06:30] where are you going?
[06:31] I'm going to Natasha's funeral
[06:33] will you go there even after listening to so many taunts?
[06:37] mom, I have no relation with Faizan
[06:40] no association
[06:45] Faizan got the punishment for his actions
[06:49] he got the punishment for being disloyal to me, but mom... 
[06:52] there wasn't any fault of Natasha in it
[07:01] I have to go
[08:48] control yourself, Sheena
[08:51] we should repent
[08:54] before the doors of apologizing shall be closed on us
[09:00] we should repent
[09:04] may God forgive us
[09:58] Razi, I will become that type of a girl which you like
[10:02] Hadia & Farwa type
[10:04] you like those girls who stays indoors, right? 
So I will become one
[10:07] you don't like my styling sense, right?
I will change my style
[10:11] you know, I am trying to learn cooking for you. So please
[10:15] I will become that type of a girl which you want me to be
[10:20] No
[10:22] Natasha look... 
[10:23] I don't want this
[10:26] however you are, you are completely perfect
[10:29] you don't need to change yourself
[10:31] you are perfect!
[11:53] Hadia dear, you here!
[11:56] I couldn't hold myself when I get to know about Natasha
[11:59] I am so sorry
[12:02] may God makes ease for her
[12:04] how did it happen?
[12:07] all are God's decisions
[12:10] nobody can delay what is written in fate
[12:16] everyone left me
[12:20] Natasha died & Faizan went to the jail
[12:24] I am destroyed
[12:32] even you had left
[12:35] honestly speaking... 
[12:37] it seems that your curse has affected us
[12:39] No, no... 
[12:41] God knows, I have never cursed you all
[12:44] Natasha was just like my sister. Believe me, I am feeling so sad
[12:52] I am sure, whatever you are saying is right
[12:56] we are unfortunate, that we couldn't value such a precious daughter like you
[13:06] if possible then forgive us
[13:10] may God always keep you happy
[14:00] oh dear, what are you doing here?
[14:04] its been only 2 days that you came back, and you are here in the kitchen
[14:07] there are a lot of servants, they will do the work
[14:10] aunty, I am habitual of doing the work
[14:13] I used to help my mom at my house
[14:15] all praise to God. Always stay happy
[14:17] but don't do all these things now, servants will do all the work
[14:22] I will like it if you will give me the responsibility of this house
[14:27] I like to do work, honestly I don't have any problem in doing kitchen chores
[14:32] this kitchen is yours, and also this house is yours. You have to handle everything
[14:36] but on the right time
[14:39] Ok tell me, how was your mother?
[14:42] thanks to God she is doing very well
[14:45] she was paying regards to you
[14:46] greetings to her too!
[14:48] I wanted to go along with you, but I didn't find it appropriate as you had gone there for the very first time
[14:54] next time I will go along with you for sure
[14:56] really?
[14:58] she will like it a lot if you will come along 
[15:01] please do come
[15:02] absolutely! I will
[15:04] what about Razi's job?
[15:07] Hamza was telling me that he got a very nice job, so when is he joining?
[15:12] yes, all praise to God. His job is really good
[15:15] but only 2 weeks are left for him to leave Pakistan
[15:18] So, your mom hadn't thought about his proposal?
[15:22] its my mother's desire, but brother Razi doesn't want
[15:27] what is the problem now? He got such a good jog, along with the house. What is he waiting for?
[15:33] maybe he is waiting for somebody's "yes"
[15:36] have you said something?
[15:38] No, I was saying... brother Razi wants to wait for a little more time
[15:45] actually Natasha died recently, and its been very less days of her death
[15:51] you are right. But it is better to put an ointment on the wound so that it can heal quickly
[16:08] would you like to drink tea?
[16:10] No, not right now. Let Hamza come then we'll drink the tea together. Ok?
[16:15] Ok, let me prepare salad till then
[16:17] Ok fine
Ok
[17:30] Safder, I have served the dinner
[17:34] please come inside to have dinner
[17:37] you haven't eaten properly since so many days, I am so worried about your health
[17:42] I am not hungry
[17:45] Safder, please...
please, as I said I am not hungry
[19:17] What kind of person are you? 
[19:20] What kind of person? 
[19:22] One shouldn't even call you a human.
[19:28] Aren't you ashamed? 
[19:31] Didn't your heart tremble cursing your own child?
[19:43] I expected everything from you but this
[19:52] and you .. 
[19:54] I haven't seen such cold hearted woman in my life
[20:01] God will take revenge from you. 
[20:05] Keep your son with you. 
[20:08] Your son and your house should go to hell.
[20:13] I'm leaving forever.
[21:53] congratulations! you've become a grand mother. Its a baby girl
[21:58] Hadia is absolutely fine, now you can meet her
[22:00] thank you so much, doctor
[22:20] isn't she crying now?
[22:23] she is your xerox
[22:28] you are so cute
[22:31] oh God! all praise to God
[22:35] what will be her name?
[22:38] yes, little Hadia
[22:43] my baby...
[22:44] give her to me
[22:52] mom, uncle Safder is quite worried
[23:01] he keeps crying in front of Natasha's grave for hours
[23:09] yes dear
[23:11] even I am so worried about Safder
[23:17] Sheena was telling me
[23:20] that my brother has left eating & drinking properly
[23:27] he isn't even taking any interest in his business
[23:31] everything is facing loss
[23:37] and...
[23:40] he had left going to office as well
[23:55] my brother has become alone
[23:58] completely alone!
[24:00] that poor guy has become hopeless from life
[24:08] but dear
[24:10] all of us together have to bring him back to life
[24:19] and... I won't be able to do this alone
[24:24] you have to help me
[24:27] if you will leave
[24:30] then who will handle him?
[24:42] the business for which he had done the hard work day & night
[24:47] everything is ruined! 
Nobody is there to handle it
[24:52] you are right, mom
[24:55] I am sorry about it
[24:59] but nothing will happen by being sorry
[25:04] what else I can do?
[25:08] I am not his real son
[25:10] but he is my real brother
[25:13] and I cannot leave my brother in this condition
[25:20] you should support him in this condition, my dear
[25:24] you should become his support, you should become his son
[25:30] don't know Faizan
[25:33] when will Faizan get released from the jail
[25:39] till then
[25:42] till then handle him
[25:49] you have to save his sinking ship
[25:53] only you
[25:55] I?
[25:57] but mom, I have already applied for the job
[26:00] you will get the job, you will get another job
[26:05] but God forbid, if something happened to Safder then?
[26:10] God forbid, mom
[26:13] what are you saying?
[26:14] I'm saying the right thing, my dear
[26:19] you have to postpone your plan for sometime
[26:25] as soon as Safder will recover
[26:29] we'll leave from here
[26:31] wherever you will say, I will go with you. But not right now
[26:36] I will not go anywhere after leaving my brother
[26:46] Ok mom
[26:48] as you say so
[26:58] stay blessed
[27:05] Hadia
[27:06] dear, do remember to invite sister Sajida & Razi
[27:14] I think you should called brother Safder & his wife as well
[27:20] mom, I try to contact them a lot but they don't respond
[27:24] neither he receives my call, nor he replies to my messages
[27:28] in fact, I had sent him Natasha's pictures too
[27:31] but they didn't answered
[27:34] I can understand
[27:37] the grief of one's child shatters a person
[27:43] Yesterday, I had a word with sister Sajida
[27:47] she was saying, your father in law stays quite worried
[27:52] he has broken completely after so many griefs
[27:59] neither he can handle the business, nor he goes to his office
[28:03] even his business is going into crisis
[28:09] don't know why Hadia, but I think we should make her meet him
[28:15] Faizan is in the jail
[28:18] but after all, they are her grand parents
[28:24] we shouldn't keep them away from their grand daughter
[28:27] mom, even I think the same
[28:30] that I should make Natasha meet her grand parents
[28:33] they shall love her & see her
[28:37] they have equal right on her, as we have
[28:41] don't worry, we'll go to Karachi as soon as we get free from Fizza's wedding
[28:47] and we'll make her meet her grand parents
[28:52] in fact, I am thinking if Faizan wants to meet his daughter sometimes
[28:57] then I won't have an objection
[29:03] however he is
[29:05] after all, he is her father
[29:08] and I don't want to keep my daughter away from her father's love
[29:14] I am proud of you, dear
[29:16] I was expecting this from you
[29:20] I've written the names on the cards, do check if I've left someone's name
[29:26] do check it yourself
[29:28] ensure to invite Razi & sister Sajida
[29:33] and dear, do try to call your father in law & mother in law once again
[29:42] my princess... my life
[30:01] oho Mr. Rehman, how can you forget this?
[30:07] what have I forgotten now?
[30:09] I am talking about Fizza's wedding gift
[30:13] oh... I forgot that
[30:17] what will happen now?
[30:18] I knew it, you don't remember anything. I've to remind you everything
[30:22] how will we arrange it so soon?
[30:24] why do you get worried so quickly?
[30:27] everything is ready, I have met the lawyer as well
[30:31] Thank God! Ok, have you mentioned all those things that I had told you
[30:36] everything is exactly the same as per your instructions
[30:39] ok listen! what if Khadija objects on it?
[30:44] why will she have an objection?
[30:45] you don't know they have very high self-respect. What if they take our gesture in a wrong manner
[30:51] they don't only have high self respect but they are very wise
[30:54] rest, if we are giving something to our daughter in law as per our will & happiness
[30:59] then why will they object on it?
[31:01] Mr. Rehman, its not something small. Why aren't you getting it?
[31:04] I don't find anything objectionable in it
[31:08] we are giving all of this to our daughter as per our happiness
[31:12] this way our daughter in law will become our business partner by 40%
[31:17] and then whether she gives our hospital project her name or he father's name
[31:23] So, I don't think so that anyone will have an objection on it
[31:27] so, what do you think?
[31:30] even I am thinking the same, that's why I have asked you to prepare these papers
[31:35] but don't know why I don't want anything to get wrong
[31:39] why do you get worried so quickly? Everything will be fine
[31:42] just do the preparations & chill. And enjoy the wedding event
[31:47] your son is the reason behind these worries
[31:50] what if he refused to come back here? What will we do then?
[31:55] when have I asked him to shift here after leaving his business?
[32:00] he Malik Abdur Rehman's son, he can live wherever he want to
[32:04] and in the same manner, our daughter in law has got complete right to spend her life here or abroad
[32:10] why do we need to worry?
[32:12] you just enjoy & make this party a memorable one
[32:18] yes, I am so excited & happy
[32:25] so are all the preparations done?
[32:28] yes, some of them are left
[33:00] Khaliq, what is the date today?
[33:02] Sir, today is 27th
[33:08] 27th? Who came to gave this card?
[33:11] oh sir, its been a lot of days. Mr. Rehman had handover the card from outside
[33:16] so Khaliq, you should have told me
[33:18] sorry sir, I made a mistake
[33:20] its alright.
Ok do one thing
[33:23] today on wards, only my chair will be kept here
[33:25] pick up the rest of the chairs once I get up
[33:28] Ok sir
[33:29] Okay
