Najma... what is the matter? Why isn't breakfast served yet?
It will be ready soon.
Where's Hadia?
She's in her room.
Alright. What about Faizan?
He's not at home.
Not at home?
Go and call Hadia to come downstairs and have breakfast.
Was Razi telling the truth about Faizan?
What should I do about him?
Pick up, Faizan. What will I tell your father?
Hello Faizan... where are you?
Father is asking about you.
Hurry up!
Bye.
All everyone does is worry me.
Faizan, why are you leaving so soon?
It's important, that's why.
What about me?
Am I not important to you?
When did I say that?
Try saying it then...
Try telling me sometimes that I'm the only important thing to you.
At least lie to make me happy.
Why would I lie?
I find peace with you, that's why I come here.
Then please don't go.
We'll spend the day together and have breakfast at a nice place.
Not today, some other day perhaps.
If you don't like going out, let me make breakfast for you.
Please understand. Everyone suspects me today and I don't want that suspicion to turn into belief.
I have to go.
Alright, go!
Hadia..
I need to talk to you.
Hadia, I only wanted to tell you that...
you don't need to be worried by Faizan anymore.
Think that whatever evidence he had against us is no more.
Hadia, I only wanted to tell you that...
you don't need to be worried by Faizan anymore.
Think that whatever evidence he had against us is no more.
What Faizan did, he did, but what you did to me wasn't right either. If you hadn't complained, then Faizan wouldn't have done anything as well.
It's his business how many times he lies to his father. What need do you have to be a hero?
I don't want to become a hero.
I just want to tell you to not be worried.
How can I believe you?
Please trust me.
I don't trust anything you say.
Khadija, I'm leaving for work.
What is the matter? Will you not escort me out today?
Khadija?
If you are not well...
then I can stay.
Will you not say anything?
I told you so many times.
I refused.
I asked you not to marry Hadia there, but you didn't listen to me once.
Now, look how unhappy my daughter is there.
What happened? Did Hadia say something to you?
Hadia never says anything.
She endures everything silently.
But...
I know...
You are being scared for no reason.
I'm not scared.
Why do you ignore everything I say? Why do you think that everything I say is nonsense?
I'm her mother.
I know the state of my daughter's heart.
Alright... don't worry. God willing, everything will get better.
How can I not worry?
What do you think...
Do you think I'm wrong?
Look... one should always hope for the best.
Always expect the best from God...
I'm sure that God will never leave our daughter alone.
Besides, my daughter is not alone there. I believe that God is with her.
Besides, we have another daughter, and we can't ignore her.
She has to go meet Nisar as well. It would be better if you talk to her.
Sure...
This way you will feel better...
Don't worry about Hadia, God will make everything alright.
When you talk to Fizza ask her if she needs anything. If she does, I'll send it to her.
Alright? I'll get going now.
Father...
I wanted to talk to you.
Sure my dear, sit down.
What is it?
Father...
If you allow me to, I would like to go to Hyderabad for a few days.
I miss my mother and father.
My dear, you can go whenever you want. You don't need to take permission.
But you going like this won't be appropriate.
You're not well and you need rest.
Besides you're upset. I donâ€™t want your...
parents to know about what happened.
Do you know that...
parents can...
know the sadness of their children from their faces.
Brother Aleem is a dear friend of mine.
I don't want to be ashamed in front of him, because I promised him that...
I will not tears appear in her daughter's eyes.
I...
don't want him to know that I was unsuccessful in keeping my promise.
Don't worry. No one will no anything.
I'm not worried about you my dear.
But I...
I'm ashamed.
Very much so.
I won't say that...
Faizan is naive. He is responsible for his actions, good or bad. He is answerable to them...
and he is answerable... to you and his God.
Parents...
are compelled by their children.
You will learn that soon, as you'll be a parent soon.
It's the same way for me as well...
My dear...
I'm compelled.
And... I request you...
to give Faizan one more chance. Maybe he'll get better when he becomes a father.
My dear, on behalf of him, I beg you for forgiveness.
Father...
Don't embarrass me, I have no complaints against you...
No, my dear...
I'm ashamed in front of you.
May God always keep you happy.
I...
I don't trust Faizan, nor him, or Natasha,
As far as your respect and honor are concerned...
As far as you standing in this house is concerned, you are not at all behind Natasha in any way.
In my eyes, you are equal to her.
I trust you more than my children.
Whatever Faizan did to you...
he will regret it. Whatever he said...
was a grave sin.
Father...
I never want to become a cause of your worries.
I will not go to Hyderabad. I will stay here with you.
I have no worries about you.
You can go.
I trust you.
Go.
Bless you.
Take care of yourself.
I'm sorry father, I'm really sorry that I lied about my admission.
I just wanted to impress you, that's why I lied. There was no other reason.
I promise I'll get admitted into a university this time.
What about your girlfriend?
All of that is a lie. Razi is lying, it's not like that at all.
I'm happy Hadia, I love her. I'm sincere and loyal to her. My family is about to get completed, there is no reason for me to leave her.
I swear that I have no girlfriend.
Safdar believe him, why would he lie?
Your fake admission holds no importance to me.
You have lied many times to me before and you have hurt me a great deal, many times before.
But this time...
Faizan, you have crossed all limits.
Even after your wedding, you had affairs. I could never think you could stoop so low.
You alleged your kind wife. I will find out about your affair, but...
as far as I'm concerned about the allegations you made about Hadia...
for that, you will apologize to her.
And if you can't do that, then pick up your stuff and leave not this house, but my life as well.
Safdar...
Don't get in between Shina.
Alright, father, I am willing to apologize to Hadia.
Natasha, call everyone in the house.
Why is that?
When he alleged her in front of everyone...
then he will have to apologize in front of everyone. 
Go, Natasha.
Mother... why didn't you come down for breakfast?
I'm not hungry.
How will you take your medicine if you don't eat? Please eat.
Where's Razi?
Maybe he's outside.
Who is it?
It's Hadia's mother.
Why aren't you picking up?
What will I say to her?
She must be calling for her daughter. What shall I tell her?
I can't bring myself to talk to her.
Sister Hadia didn't come to breakfast today as well.
She had breakfast in her room as well today.
What's happening to her is not good. I feel sorry for her.
My dear, why don't you go and sit with her for a while? That might make her feel a little better.
She had no one here. She doesn't have her mother and sister. Who can she share her pain with?
Faizan is not doing right by her.
May God give guidance to Faizan.
Amen... what else can we expect from brother Faizan?
Yes... one can bear to lose everything, but not one's honor.
I trust brother Razi, he can never do anything wrong. Brother Faizan did this on purpose.
But he has sowed the seed of doubt in everyone's heart.
He has done what he wanted to do. You are unaware of the cruel tricks of this world.
You cannot see what I'm seeing.
Auntie, father is asking you two to come downstairs.
Sure, alright.
Farwa, where's Razi? Father is asking for him as well.
He must be on the lawn, I'll call him.
I'll do that.
Wait.
Farwa, go and call Razi...
Sure.
I'm sorry Hadia, I shouldn't have said what I said.
I want to apologize for that.
Faizan... apologize to Razi as well.
Out of the question. I can be wrong about Hadia, but I'm sure of what I said about Razi.
I will not apologize to him. You can oust me if you want. I don't care.
It's okay uncle.
I don't need his apologies.
It's enough that he's ashamed of what he did.
I'm not ashamed! Ashamed at what?
Silence yourself. You know what I'm saying is the truth!
And I will prove that you have bad intentions toward my wife Hadia!
Faizan!
You're being ill-mannered.
No, I'm not! I'm only answering it.
Don't think that your son is an honorable man. I will unveil his face to everyone soon.
I'm not saying much because my wife's name is involved in this, otherwise, I would have told everyone what a vile man you are.
You're crossing all limits. My silence doesn't mean you can say whatever you want.
You know I have reasons for saying these things. You know I have proof.
Proof? Show it then?
Where is your proof?
I will... I will who it in front of everyone.
Just wait and watch. I will prove to everyone that he's a snake in the grass.
I will prove to everyone that he's a snake in the grass.
I will unveil his true face to everyone. I'm not saying much because my wife's name is attached to all this.
Otherwise, I would have told everyone how vile a man you are.
You must be sad about what brother Faizan said.
My sadness isn't anything... 
in front of the pain that Hadia felt.
Brother... you're still worried about her pain. you don't care about yourself.
Hadia is in pain because of me.
But, it was important to tell uncle about this, otherwise, brother Faizan would have kept on betraying sister Hadia.
That's what he's taking revenge for.
Can you not clear all of this with brother Faizan?
Things can only be cleared with people who realize their mistakes.
All Faizan wants to do is defame me in front of my uncle. He only wants to put a veil on his mistakes.
He doesn't know that this will only harm him.
I was only silent because of Hadia today. Because Hadia doesn't want to drag this out further.
I don't want to cause her any more pain.
Brother, even after all that happened you only care about her.
I only want to see Hadia happy.
Only happy.
She was very happy with Faizan, but I don't know what happened. That man doesn't care for her...
That man doesn't even care for his unborn child.
It's unfair...
Brother...
If only she could have seen your honesty and good intentions the same way...
It's hard. Very hard.
It is hard.
But not impossible.
Faizi, why aren't you eating? Eat this.
Thank you.
Sir, your bill.
Faizi, where is your attention? The food has gone cold, what's wrong with you?
Pack it up, your mother will eat it up.
Excuse me...
Why would my mother eat our leftovers?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry.
Sir, your card is not working.
What do you mean? Try again, your machine must not be working
I've tried multiple times, kindly please pay in cash, sir.
Who keeps cash nowadays...
Mother, where's father? Is he okay now?
He just took his medicine and went to sleep.
I didn't expect this from Faizan.
I wasn't expecting that as well. It was fine when it was just words, but seeing him being physical with him...
I didn't expect that.
So absurd. Faizan is the one at fault here.
I don't know what problem he has with Razi.
It's Razi's fault as well. This situation is like this because of him.
What's wrong with you? Why do you always blame Razi? Why don't you try to make Faizan understand?
Because he's wrong and I will blame him. I don't want to hear his name from you again, understand?
What's wrong with you? Why do you always against what I like?
Because you choose everything that is not of our status.
Razi is not a thing. I like him.
And don't even talk about Faizan. Where is he all day? So much has happened and you're still scolding me. You didn't say a word to him.
It's good that father blocked his cards.
What kind of children are they? They are each other's enemies.
Whenever your father is upset at you, he blocks your card.
He doesn't care about me. He boasts about his wealth.
Forget about it. He's your father, don't be upset at him.
I know he's my father, but this is wrong.
How will I manage our expenses?
Faizan, don't worry about my expenses. I will get by.
I will not complain to you.
Thank you.
Ramsha, I have always misunderstood you...
you're very good.
It's alright. I'm just glad that you finally realize that.
Better late than never.
Should I give you some advice?
What?
Whenever your card activates, withdraw cash and keep it aside.
So that you don't face any worry again.
That is a very good idea. I'll do that.
Now tell me the real reason...
Why did your father do this to you?
I told you... Razi told him about us.
I think there is another reason. If that were the case, he would have investigated where I was.
Faizan, you are hiding something from me. I've started noting that you're upset at Hadia all the time as well.
It's not like that.
Everything is alright with Hadia.
We only have small arguments. Everything else is alright.
Faizan please, you can trust me.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Where are you coming from?
How's that your business?
I'm your wife.
Really?
I was just with my girlfriend.
Go and tell father. Why don't you tell Razi, and he'll tell father.
I'm disappointed in you and your thinking.
Who stopped you? Be as disappointed as you want.
But don't expect anything from me.
Not even a little bit.
