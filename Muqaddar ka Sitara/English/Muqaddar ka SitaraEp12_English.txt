Why did you have to make so many objections?
You and your son have become so obstinate.
I couldn't even think that I would have to explain to you on every step that you need to cooperate.
brother Alim is now our relative and you object on everything he does. Be considerate!
If he is our relative, should I make him sit on my head, even if he is being stupid?
What did he do now?
Safdar didn't you see.
First he sent some cheap furniture to my house
and now he brought some cheap oily breakfast early in the morning.
I think if he could, he would stay here.
That's what you're thinking.
He's a very self made man
and such people don't even drink water from their daughter's house.
Whether he does that or not, I really don't care
but I don't like all this nonsense.
What nonsense?
These are our traditions.
Safdar leave these antique traditions behind.
He is finding something after another.
Tell me, couldn't I give your daughter in law breakfast at home?
I feel you like this oily breakfast.
Then why did you come for breakfast. You shouldn't have come like your children didn't.
Your son.. After what your son did, you should have been ashamed.
He was drunk! Be thankful to Hadia.
She's not so innocent. She'll speak one day.
And then everyone will know about your son's antics.
Rather than being thankful you're just accusing that respectable man.
Alright, so you're here and I'm looking for you everywhere.
Why were you looking for me?
You're usually not home at this time so I made tea to have it with you.
Thank you.
It seems the tea got cold because you were looking for me.
Give it to me, I'll make another one.
No.
Are you upset?
Do you know
when mom said no to uncle
I thought mom was wrong
but I couldn't understand mom's foresight.
Had uncle turned back on his decision, mom would have been very upset.
So do you think I'm not upset?
I didn't mean that. You're a very strong person.
You bore it. But mom, she would have been broken.
But this decision has hurt me very much.
We respect uncle so much but he..
No Farwa.
Uncle has done us a lot of favors.
I agree he has done so much for us but this doesn't mean...
No.
Let it be, its alright.
I think you need  to make me another tea. Go.
Are you sending me away.
Of course. You're talking weird. You're making me crazy.
We shouldn't really be sympathizing with anyone.
I'm upset for you and you...
Farwa, when did you start watching such films and dramas.
I was fine alone and you came here with your tea and stupid talk.
Think about it. You're missing out on good tea.
Please Farwa.
Okay fine. I'll give it to mom.
Are you done sleeping?
Have you stopped being hungover?
Have some shame Faizan?
I had to lie for you.
If Hadia's parents find out that you left her and went out with your drunkard friends to get drunk,
do you know what will happen?
They'll end everything!
And my respect will be torn to shreds.
I did what you wanted!
I married Hadia.
Now what else do you want me to do? Should I die for her?
How are you talking to me?!
Please go. I don't want to talk to anyone.
Even I don't want to talk to you. But remember this Faizan,
If you do anything wrong in the function today, I'll make a spectacle out of you! Ill mannered!
There's nobody worse than you!
Here is your juice. Take it.
Whose calling? Don't answer it.
Let him pine. It'll be a lot of fun. He's pining.
I pity this guy. How many times has he called?
Natasha, its time for your salon appointment and you're still here.
Whats up mom? You're very excited for Faizan's reception.
You were very irritated yesterday.
I'm not excited for Faizan's reception but your preparation.
For me? What do you mean?
Natasha, didn't I tell you the reception will have your father's friends Mr. and Mrs. Rehman.
Their son Nisar is a doctor in America.
And again, why are you telling me this?
I'm not telling you, I'm repeating it.
Your dad and I like Nisar for you
and I want Mrs. Rehman to like you.
Right.
That's why you selected this dress for me and this appointment. in the salon.
Of course.
Natasha trust me. Nisar is hundred times better than Razi. You'll be very happy with him.
Listen to me. Get up and get ready. Get up.
You can be really pushy at times.
For your benefit.
You don't understand my condition Zohaib. I love her. I cannot live without her.
Faizan relax. Nothing will happen to Ramsha. Just pray for her.
I've been doing that.
As soon as the reception is done, I'll fly to her. I want to meet her.
No. Don't do that.
Ramsha's mother is very upset with you.
Let me calm her down and then both of us will go to Dubai to ask about our friend.
Alright.
Talk to her mother and ask her to answer my phone. I want to apologize to her.
I will. Don't worry. Just relax.
How can I relax? I am not at peace
ever since I found out that she left me because of dad. I'll never forgive my father.
I can never forgive him.
Faizan don't do anything harsh in your rage. Your father is your bank balance.
If you leave him, you'll be in a loss yourself.
Okay
Alright I'll talk to you later.
Hello Shazia. How are you? How are you dear Nisar?
I'm fine aunty, how are you?
Absolutely fine.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Shazia this is my daughter Natasha.
Hie aunty.
How are you dear?
Absolutely fine.
Did you take any refreshments. Should I send something?
Oh no. Its okay. You have arranged an amazing event for the reception.
Thank you.
Your daughter in law is very beautiful. She's looking like a doll sitting there.
Tell me, does your daughter in law have a sister?
Yes of course.
She does.
I think its the girl sitting next to her.
Yes she's the same.
She's very beautiful.
Thank you. Please sit. I'll send over something for you.
Okay, thank you.
Razi please let go of these cheap antics.
I know very well why you're doing everything.
Really?
Then tell me why I'm doing everything?
Obviously you want to be frank with me but let me just tell you,
its not going to work here so please stop.
Please allow us to leave, its getting late. The arrangements were amazing.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming. You graced this event with your presence.
Will Hadia come with us?
What? You want the reception bride to go back to her house?
This might be some tradition as well.
No. Its nothing.
Brides can visit their parents whenever they want after their wedding.
Nothing is mandatory.
Alright, thank God.
Don't worry brother Aleem. Faizan will bring Hadia to your place.
Please go see them off to their car.
Please come.
Alright dear.
Will you keep standing there?
Do you expect me to come there, hold your hand and make you sit here?
This won't happen.
You are beautiful.
And now you'll want me to gift you something valuable. Every girl wants that.
You're my wife.
Its your right.
Come.
I don't know where mom kept the gift.
How are you feeling now?
What happened to me?
Aunty was telling me you had food poisoning.
I got food poisoning?
Yes. It was painful but I'm better now.
And how is your friend?
What happened to my friend?
He got into an accident on our wedding night.
Severe accident. Doctors said that he's critical. He got injured but doing better.
Are you not feeling irritated because of this heavy dress? Do you want to change?
And listen?
Yes?
Make coffee for me.
Right now?
Yes.
You look good.
Make coffee we'll talk. I want to know you.
I cannot hold a conversation without a coffee. It seems awkward. Make coffee.
Where did you keep the gift?
Gift? Why? Is she asking for it?
No she isn't. I want to give her myself.
Give it to her tomorrow. I don't remember where I kept it.
What do you mean you don't remember? What is this?
What do you mean? Give it to her tomorrow.
You in the kitchen, at this hour?
Did you want something?
I wanted to make coffee
but I can't find it.
Did Faizan ask you to make it?
What did you break here?
What are you doing here?
She's here to make coffee for Faizan.
Yes he takes coffee at this hour.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to get water.
Please help her to find coffee.
She's worried.
Good night.
The coffee is in the last cabinet.
And listen, make coffee and go to your room fast.
Don't tell your uncle about it.
Faizan?
Faizan?
Hello uncle.
Hello. May you live long. Set it here and call..
Hello.
Hello. I was asking about you. Where is Razi?
He was up all night and left for work early in the morning.
Without breakfast?
He said he would have breakfast in office.
How can he live without eating? He'll eat at the office. You continue please.
I will but where are Faizan and Hadia. Why aren't they here yet?
Don't you know Faizan doesn't wake up early? Hadia might be asleep as well.
I have to attend an important meeting. I stayed back to have breakfast with them. Go and call them.
Sure uncle. I'll go and call them.
You should have told them that we'll have breakfast together.
Faizan
please wake up. Its morning.
What should I do if its morning? Its everyday.
Lets have breakfast its 10'o clock.
I wake up at 12. If you want to go, go ahead.
Where are you going?
Beautiful..
Do you know something?
I was worried without a reason.
Dad's choice isn't bad at all.
We're coming.
You go ahead. I'm coming.
Hello.
Hello. May you live long dear. Come sit with me.
No dear. Come sit with Hadia.
But I always sit there.
Yes but you'll sit here with Hadia now.
I don't care whether someone comes or leaves. I'm not changing my lifestyle.
Faizan sit with Hadia. She'll like it and so will we.
Please sit.
What is all this? You know I get fresh juice every morning not all this. Get me one.
I'll go make it.
No dear. You sit. I'm done with my breakfast. I'll make it.
Please start with the name of God dear.
