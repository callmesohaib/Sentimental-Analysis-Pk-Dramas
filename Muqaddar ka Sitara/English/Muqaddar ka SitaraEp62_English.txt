you!
come inside
you don't seem well, brother
sister Sajida was telling me that you don't take care of yourself
brother Safder
believe me
I feel so sorry about Natasha
I wanted to come but the situation was as such that I couldn't come
I can understand, sister
everything got destroyed even though my intentions were good
may God never gives a child's grief to anyone
I have been through this trial
and I am unsuccessful
I am left with nothing
Natasha died
I know your Natasha had died
but... 
a small Natasha has also come
look who is here
if you wouldn't have come today to meet your grand daughter, then I would have brought her myself
All praise to God
she is so cute, All praise to God
what is her name?
Natasha
all of us have kept her name Natasha
and brother look
she is exactly like Natasha
she is so cute
Okay... 
please sit, let me bring something to eat
I had never listened to you
I have always betrayed you
I had always done the other way of whatever you had asked me to do
always... 
but today I...
I am promising you by making God the witness, that whatever you will say
I will do it
will you do whatever I will ask you to do?
dad, I swear
I swear upon my life
I swear upon mom, you & Natasha
I swear upon Natasha
sign these papers
what is this, dad?
these are divorce papers
Hadia wants to end her every relation with you
she... 
free her
Faizan, just now you had promised me that whatever I will tell you. You will do it
Faizan, do you know
I made a hasty decision of marrying you with Hadia & I got you guys married
and I am regretting my decision till date
but now when
I am asking you to sign these divorce papers
I'm sure, that my this decision
will be a better decision for Hadia's life
look... 
if you
won't sign these papers then I... 
I won't sign the papers of lessening your imprisonment
and it is decided that when you will be released from the jail then
you won't be able to see my face ever
I have less time
before this time ends you.. 
please do the signatures on these papers so that... 
I shall leave from here
this... 
please don't do this oppression
dad, Hadia is the only happiness in my life
she is the last hope for me, don't snatch it from me
don't snatch my happiness from me, please don't do this injustice to me dad
don't do this oppression
Hadia also have a right to stay happy, my dear
now I... 
cannot snatch this right from her
you have to sign these papers
dad
look... 
today I won't say to you to forgive me for the last time
but I have a request
since Natasha is not there anymore
and I am also not there with mom, so please take care of her
dad please take care of her
even I am not there
I... 
I had never imagined you to be like this
but... 
maybe it was predestined
yes
take care of yourself
don't lose hope
if life allowed me
I will wait for you
there was a time when I had made you my daughter in law
by going against everyone
and now its me
who is giving you the divorce deed in your hands and... 
ending my all relations with you
now I don't have any association with you
neither of my friend or of my son
all of this
is predestined by God
Sometimes they associate us, and sometimes they separate us
the nature's plays are rare
dear, I am sure that
you must have
forgiven me
greetings to you! 
how are you all?
ok children, you know that our school competition is about to start
these are inter school competition. And children will perform & participate from all the cities
you know children will be coming from all the schools & cities. And it will be a tough competition for us
but I trust you girls. Are you going to make us proud?
brother
have you decided to go abroad in real?
yes Farwa
its been a lot of time, besides Faizan will come back tomorrow
I have helped uncle as much as I could
but now I have to leave
I don't think so that uncle needs me anymore
this way uncle will be left alone
I don't want to stay here
there are a lot of bitter memories of the past
I also have a life, I want peace as well
so do you still love Hadia?
anyways leave it, tell me how are you?
you cannot ignore me this way
tell me honestly
do you still love Hadia?
love is never ending, Farwa
it keeps on increasing
sometimes by becoming peace or grief
then why are you running away from love?
not from love
I am running away from my fate
Hadia's name is not written in my fate, Farwa
but there isn't any compulsion at all
now there is no one in between you & Hadia
distances can be lessened if you take a step forward
listen to your heart for once
No Farwa
I've controlled my heart with a lot of difficulty
I don't want to tolerate all the bearings once again
but brother, what is the harm in trying once?
please agree on it
don't insist Farwa
sometimes a person's efforts go in vain
I don't want to give false hopes to my heart once again, please
brother, maybe... 
this time your heart doesn't break
the way you are waiting for happiness
the same way, somebody else must be waiting for you on the other side
just once
try to think about it for once
ma'am Hadia, there is a guy to meet you. 
He says, he wants to meet ma'am Hadia
who?
he isn't telling me the name, he says he wants to meet Ma'am Hadia
Okay, send him in
Natasha, my dear child
here you go, drink milk
I know my presence is hurting you
I am not capable enough to come in front of you
and to apologize to you
everything is finished
I've become completely alone. Everything is ruined
you've chosen this destruction for yourself
you have not only made me face the loss, but you did injustice to yourself
Hadia, I've realized all my mistakes & injustices very late
I am getting so hurt today while listening my name from your mouth
there was a time when your companionship was everything for me in my life
you don't have an idea that what you did with me
you have shaken my soul & existence
my father died
in the grief just because he had handover his daughter to a wrong person
you didn't spared your own child as well
you had refused to accept your child as your own, who does that?
forgive me, Hadia
I am your culprit, I did a lot of injustices. Please
Please forgive me otherwise I won't be able to stay alive
Please
Please
forgive me
how unfortunate I am that I couldn't see my daughter, I couldn't love her
I couldn't give her my name
you have decided this punishment for yourself
I just came to apologize to you, and... 
I came to meet my daughter for the last time. After this I will leave for forever, I won't show you my face ever
I forgave you, Faizan
just because... 
Natasha is your daughter
and I don't want to keep my daughter away from her father
I wish I had valued you
then all of this wouldn't have happened
take care of yourself and... 
of our daughter too
bye!
Faizan
take care
today I am going far away from this country empty hands, after losing everything
there is nothing left for me in this country
except for regrets
which are laughing on me
yes mom, I am coming. We are leaving in a while
yes, aunty will also come along
No, I will stay over. Don't worry. Bye!
where are you planning to go?
to my mother's house
why?
there is a joyous occasion
I didn't get it
there is a very big surprise for brother Raazi
and we want to celebrate it together
Oh! so you are going alone over there to enjoy
by leaving me alone over here
you are not alone, a lot of people are here
no fair Farwa! I didn't expect this from you
I am joking! my mother has invited you & your mother as well
in fact, aunty has got ready too
do you know, my mother & you have made up a great team 
now tell me what is your order for me?
the order for you is that, quickly go & get ready
because mom had asked me to reach there before time
right now?
yes
ok fine, I'm going to get freshen up. Meanwhile take out my clothes
I've already taken out your clothes
thank you!
dear, if you consider me an honorable person for you then
listen to me
enter Raazi in your life
maybe this way
he won't go abroad and.. 
changes his decision
uncle, now I want to spend the rest of my life with Natasha
dear... 
I am being punished for my wrong decisions till date
maybe they get rectified by your decision
he loves you even today
your "yes"
can bring him back to life
the decision is yours, my dear
did you say something?
I wanted to say a lot, Hadia
but I am unable to say it
this heart is scared of losing you again & again
do you know
my love, my emotions are true for you
till the time I am alive, this heart
Raazi's heart will keep on beating by taking your name
even after a lot of time has passed
but still your love hasn't lessen for me
you also come along with us, uncle
No dear.. 
my support was till here only
may God bless your new chapter of life
dear, I have a small request
how many times I have told you
you won't request but order
dear, no matter what happen
never make me realize in my life that... 
my daughter is no more in this world
dad!
