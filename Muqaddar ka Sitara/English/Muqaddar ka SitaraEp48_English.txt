Your sister is just like you!
What do you mean?
The same like you are cheating on me!
Stop it Faizan.
Your personality has changed! You just act innocent.
You are not loyal at all.
Hello! Hi!
Good morning!
Why are you so serious always?
Serious? No I'm not.
I might be!
I actually like your this act!
I'm just a little too talkative.
No! I don't think that.
So why are you not my proper friend yet?
Friendship?
I'm conversing with you! What else do you call a friendship?
We don't have that understanding yet!
So why is it important to build some understanding in friendship?
It is really important for friends to understand each other.
And now you have to give me proper time.
We'll join each other on morning jogs.
And enjoy some long drives later. How about that? We'll get to know each other better.
That's all good Natasha but I think you should be friends with Farwa as she can be your good friend, and Fizza too. Also Hadia.
You can talk to her too.
I'm already friends with Farwa! As I'm learning to cook your favorite dishes.
Why my favorite dishes?
Look! I'm doing this all for you. I've left my old friends.
Now I've started to study properly, and spend my time at home. I've started cooking as well.
Why for me?
You tell me! Can't you guess why I'm doing this all for you?
No! I don't know.
Raazi! Why do you act so dumb? I'm doing this all for you.
It's because I love you and I want to become the girl that you desire for.
Are you in your senses? What are you doing.
What's wrong in it?
What happened? What's wrong about that?
Natasha! Do you remember how you used to misbehave with me when you came to Pakistan for the first time, and I used to live at your place.
You used to tell me that I'm nothing without your father.
Raazi I'm really sorry for what I've done.
I was wrong at that time and I didn't realize my reaction towards you was embarrassing.
But now I respect you.
I feel sorry for everything that I've done and said!
Why are you doing this all?
I've started to fall in love with you. That's why!
Don't act so childish Natasha! This is very bad.
Why are you not taking me seriously?
That's because we are different from each other.
So Raazi that's good. Opposites attract!
It's not mandatory for us to be the same, to get married.
Raazi! I'll surely become the girl you like. Just like Hadia and Farwa's type.
I'll only stay indoors for you. I'll change my style for you, and I'm also learning to cook for you.
I'll become the girl that you desire for!
No Natasha! I don't want that.
You are perfect as you are! You don't need to change yourself. You are perfect.
Fizza is absolutely right mother! She deserves a better guy than Nisar. It's like Nisar didn't deserve her. There will be soon more proposals for her.
Sure daughter! But I liked that boy in reality.
He was so educated, well mannered and respectful.
I felt so bad.
I also felt bad mother as I also praised his personality.
You are absolutely right about him but what can we do now?
I feel so angry and hefty right now.
I might even kill him if I he decides to confront me. Why would he do such thing with my daughter?
I would do the same but how would we find him?
Sure darling!
Raazi told me.
Your Father didn't allow.
Father is right!
We'll get more embarrassed after such act!
Why should we take favor from anyone! People nowadays don't even believe such things!
Fizza's matter will be discussed widely in my house! And I don't want that.
Now you should just pray that God should not forgive the one who played with our respect.
Amen!
Are you fine!
I'm absolutely fine! What will happen to me?
You should not worry about me!
Why should I not worry?
You should take care of yourself!
I'm doing this all just for you! It's because I love you.
I want to become the girl of your desire.
This is not good at all.
I don't know what's in her mind! If she talks about such a thing in her family, I'll be pressurized.
Mother's right! I think I should leave.
But uncle won't let me leave! What should I do?
I cannot accept Natasha at all.
I cannot return the favors of my uncle my whole life!
But If I marry Natasha!
Raazi! I've asked you so many times about your marriage. Why don't you answer?
Mother! The pictures you showed me.
You can choose according to your choice.
Thank god!
Thank god you said this! You know that I like a girl. Her name is Rubab.
I'll send you her picture.
Listen Zohaib! You cannot come here anytime you want too. Faizan can be here any moment!
It would be bad for us.
But Faizan didn't visit us after that day.
That is more risky because he can come anytime.
You are right but I just talked to Faizan. He is in office with his father.
That's why I came.
I also did! He is busy with his official work nowadays.
He might not visit for a bit.
How is he suddenly so busy nowadays.
Mother if you ask the truth. I don't think that he is so interested in his office.
I think it's just an excuse! There might be some problems with his wife. I'm just guessing it.
You know well that he doesn't share things so often with me.
You are so lucky Rimsha! We were discussing Hadia that day, and suddenly they both came in front of you and just like that you recorded them.
Fine! But that recording didn't benefit me at all.
When I showed that video to Faizan! He didn't react that much.
I felt like he didn't care that much, that his wife is hanging out with his cousin so openly.
He might be blindfolded or he has started to value her so much that these acts of her don't affect him.
People always prefer there first wife always. Even if they don't love her.
Second marriage is most of the times hidden. The groom doesn't show affection to his second wife at all.
It's not a sin to marry again! The first wife always acts innocent in front of the world after her husband marries again.
Men! Nowadays, men don't have the guts to talk about their second marriage at all.
You are absolutely right! Faizan is not less than his father at all. After his father dies, He'll surely be the next Safdar but exclusive.
Such people don't care about anything more than their status.
Rimsha! He won't ever prefer you over Hadia at all.
I'm worried if Hadia gives birth! She'll be on his mind my forever. Faizan won't leave her.
Rimsha I know! You want yourself as Faizan's wife and part of his family but
Just think about it! Even after trying so many things, you fail your plan. You still need another option, right? You should yourself be so rich.
That you can live the life of your choice just like Hadia.
Then you should yourself suggest me something Zohaib!
I have a cousin in Dubai. He is a proper builder! Nowadays he is in Karachi.
He has great opportunities for investment. I have myself invested. You should also invest a little amount.
It'll surely profit you.
How can I invest on my own? I don't have such amount. I can try taking some from Faizan!
You can help me with this for sure.
How?
We can arrange a meeting of Faizan and your builder cousin on purpose.
OK! Then this is what you should do.
Organize a party! Invite me obviously! I'll bring my cousin with me.
We'll get them to meet each other and my cousin has a very interesting personality.
My cousin can handle everything on his own as he knows how to sell his investments.
Are you sure that this won't bring any bad to me?
Rimsha! Before taking any such step, you've to think twice or it might result in some loss later.
Rimsha! If you don't trust me. It's completely fine.
Nobody is actually forcing you!
He always suggests something foolish.
Mother we'll think about this properly. Relax! Why are you getting so worked up.
We are in a kind of trouble Rimsha.
We'll think about it.
Mother! I have a question!
Will you help me get married to Raazi? Yes or no?
Never!
Fine! Then I'll go and tell father that you were involved in Fizza's case and everything happened because of you.
So you'll blackmail your own mother? You'll blackmail me?
Sure! If you can perform such an act to break someones relationship.
Then why can't I force you to get myself a relationship.
You know well that what will be your father's reaction!
You should have thought about this before Mother!
Natasha! Don't test my patience! I'm warning you the last time.
Then you need to stop pushing me as well mother!
I'm also telling you last time.
I'm in love with Raazi and I cannot live without him.
You did this all because you could see me hurt, right? Can't you see now that I'm still getting hurt.
This product has more sales and orders, so double it!
I'll call you back in some time! Sure! OK!
Yes Fizza?
Greetings Raazi!
Greetings!
I have sent you his name, number and other details.
Good!
And also.
Fawad doesn't love me at all! He just lies.
If he really loved me.
He wouldn't disrespect me like this! He would have cared for me.
I just want to know the reason behind this all.
Just let me know the reason.
Don't worry! I'll inform you everything.
Thank you! And listen.
Don't let anyone know about this. Not even my parents.
I told you.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
No problem! Goodbye!
Yes mother!
Where are you son?
Mother! I am
Busy with some official work!
I wanted to congratulate you.
About what?
The people who came for Farwa's proposal. They are happy with her.
This is great! Congratulations.
Congrats to you too! they were saying that we are ready for the wedding.
Mother don't worry! I'll surely handle everything.
I'll arrange her wedding in the best way.
For sure!
Son! Today I'm really happy.
Sure mother! I'll be back in a bit.
Listen! While coming back, give some charity!
Sure mother! I'll do it.
OK son! Now I'll hang up.
I'll inform your uncle about this happy news too.
Sure! Bye!
Bye!
I just got better a week ago! That guy was selfish. He didn't even tell his name in the hospital.
When I became conscious, I saw him leaving.
He didn't even tell me about his university! I searched for him at many institutes but finally today I've found him.
Sir! I've a request.
I know it's not your policy to provide any private information or details but for the sake of humanity.
Let me know his number or home address, as I want to meet his family.
I want to thank them! Please.
Greetings! Are you Fizza's relative, right?
Greetings!
I'm Fizza's friend! She showed me her sister's wedding photos. I recognized you from there.
OK!
Fizza is not attending the university from so many days. I've tried calling her but she didn't pick any of my calls.
Is she fine?
She is absolutely fine! She actually went back to Hydrabad. She might not ever come back in this university.
Yes! I know! It's all because of that Fawad.
If he didn't tease Fizza! Fizza would have never left.
Who is this Fawad?
Do you know him?
The whole university knows him!
He is such a mentally disturbed boy. Fizza tried to help him so many times.
But he didn't stop his foolish acts.
The whole university saw his and Fizza's pictures. Just because of him.
Fizza was just worried about his career! That is why she didn't take any action. He doesn't deserve it anyway.
If you don't mind. Can you tell me about him something more interesting.
Since the day Fizza's pictures went viral! I haven't seen Fawad in the university.
Fine! Thank you so much. Your good name?
Momal!
Thank you for helping me with all this information.
Your welcome! Tell Fizza that she should talk to me.
Sure! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Leave it! What about the factory?
It's good that you guys are here. I wanted to tell something important.
Sister! Come and sit. You seem so happy.
Yes Safdar! I'm actually really happy today.
Do you remember that we had invited some people over for Farwa's proposal.
Yes! I remember.
They have accepted the proposal.
And now they want our response!
Congrats sister!  Congrats sister!
You should believe that I liked that boy the same day.
He is a great guy! I was already waiting for them to accept the proposal.
If you guys have time! Can we visit them next week?
What are you talking about sister? I am always free for you.
If you allow! We'll arrange an engagement on the coming Sunday.
No! No need to arrange an engagement. They want to get them both married quickly.
We'll arrange a small event and then they both will get married.
That's also good sister!
It's been so many days since there has been no enjoyment around our house. We'll enjoy this event.
I'll get Farwa married the same way as I thought about Natasha!
Natasha just.
Don't get dis hearted Safdar! Kids make mistakes. Forget about it.
After her iddat completes, Find a nice groom for hr and get her married.
Sister! Why should we find?
We have a guy already at home.
Get Raazi married before as he is elder.
I have told him but he always ignores me by telling me to get Farwa married.
We can get them both married together. Farwa will depart and you can take your niece with yourself. What about it Safdar?
What are you thinking sister?
She is the daughter of your lovely brother, right?
That's fine Sheena but you know there's a difference between Raazi's and Natasha's attitude.
Only Safdar wanted this proposal to happen. Neither you nor Natasha!
Leave the past behind now! I didn't know Raazi at that time. Now I know him very well. He is just like the guy I desired for Natasha!
And now Natasha doesn't mind at all.
But now Raazi won't accept.
Try talking to him about this.
I think Raazi will accept!
But It looks like you don't want this to happen.
Or it might be because you are hurt from our denial.
No! It's nothing like that.
Then you should accept this proposal, right! Natasha is your brother's most loving child.
That brother of yours, who made your son such a huge business man and gave you a place to stay.
Sheena!
Let me speak! Tell me sister.
Don't you feel good staying with us?
Don't you feel respected when you stay in such a big house and travel in such luxurious cars?
You feel good, right?
Sheena please!
Let me talk.
This is not the way to talk!
No Safdar! Let her speak.
You are right! But Sheena
Me and my kids will never forget the favors of Safdar!
Why didn't you speak about this before?
Only Safdar was happy with this proposal before.
And Natasha also didn't agree with this proposal.
Now that Natasha... Forgive me Safdar!
But I'm forcefully saying this. My son Raazi is in front of you guys.
You tell me yourself! Will your divorced daughter bring any good to my son?
What's with you?
What's with her?
Rimsha arranged such a boring party!
Whatever! A party is a party!
Yeah!
Who is this? I've never seen him before.
What? oh!
He wanted to meet you!
Me?
Yes you! He wanted some business tips from you.
Who is he?
He is a proper builder in Dubai. He has his own tower there.
He wants to open a Pakistani cuisine based restaurant there. That's why he needs some suggestions. So I thought about uncle.
So!
Do you think your father will be interested in expanding his business in Dubai?
Why would father open another one? He already owns a restaurant in Dubai. It's also a Pakistani cuisine.
So! Why don't you open your own business? A separate restaurant for yourself!
Are you kidding me? How can I? I don't have the capital or any experience.
Faizan! Come on. Leave the capital and experience out of it. Don't underestimate yourself.
Do you remember that sometime ago we went to a plaza and there was a restaurant and you helped that restaurant's staff with pointing out the flaws.
Why they had less customers, you pointed it all out. I was very impressed by your knowledge about restaurants.
Fine! But criticizing and giving opinions is easy but opening a proper restaurant is something different.
If you ask me, you should think about your separate business.
That is my opinion for you. But for now, share your expert advice with Saliq here as he is ready.
Everything is ready but he is only looking for an experienced guy!
I'm not interested yet!
What is wrong with you Faizan? Why are you letting an opportunity slide?
Try to think like a progressive man.
And he might pay you for your expert advice.
What do you mean?
I mean he is a professional man! He is rich too!
You might even mind but
He can buy your father's restaurants just like that.
But I know you feel uncomfortable right now. Let's leave it! Forget about it.
Let's meet him!
This is what I'm talking about.
You are always jealous of me! Come.
Saliq! let me introduce you to someone.
