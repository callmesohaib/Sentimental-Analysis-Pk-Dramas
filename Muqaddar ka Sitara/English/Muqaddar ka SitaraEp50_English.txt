Many congratulations to you all.
Thank you*
Father, when are you marrying Natasha then?
Whenever sister asks me to.
What should I do? I have to marry Farwa first, as her in-laws are insisting upon it.
Otherwise, I wanted to marry the two of them together.
It's alright. Farwa is like my daughter as well. Besides, it will take some time for Natasha to get better.
I'm in no rush to get Natasha married, as she is my only daughter.
I will arrange her wedding with all pageantry. It will be a grander marriage than Faizan's.
Go ahead and marry Farwa. As we'll be waiting for Natasha's wedding.
Natasha, you must be tired, go home and rest.
I was about to say the same thing. Go and rest my dear.
Take her Farwa.
Sure, come on Natasha.
I'm tired, so I should go as well.
Where are you going? I need your advice on Farwa's wedding.
Whatever it is you can discuss it with sister, why do you need me?
There is nothing to worry about. Let me prepare for the wedding.
Father, you can take the important decisions, whereas I will do all of the shopping for the wedding.
Wow... you've sorted out all the problems. Thank you, my dear.
Mother...
You know me very well, still, you took this decision. How can I even do this?
Yes mother, how could you even think that brother Razi can agree to marry Natasha?
You gave her the ring, what if you had taken back on your word...
Then that would have been that.
I would have told them that I did that only because of her childish behavior.
What if she had tried to do something like that again?
I admit that I made a mistake. But now, will you not maintain a keepsake of your mother's word?
That's what I did. Didn't I put the ring on her?
My dear, you'll have to commit yourself to this relationship as well.
Safdar already has...
Sure...
Uncle Safdar already has done a lot of favors for us! For God's sake, enough mother!
I think that even if I give him the rest of my life, even then you won't be satisfied.
I'm ashamed and regretful of my mistake.
What's the point in you being ashamed?
My life has been ruined. Alright then...
I have always agreed with everything you've asked me to do. In the future, I will carry on doing the same. I will never let you be ashamed.
Are you happy now? Stay happy then.
Why and how did this happen?
Mother, you know brother very well. You know brother has never talked to you like that.
I don't understand how all this happened.
Why did I have such a big misunderstanding?
Don't worry about it too much. We can't change what happened. Pray that God finds a solution for this.
Your doubt should be cleared away now. Razi is marrying your sister.
He's lying, he deceiving Natasha and all of us.
He's doing all of this so that he can prove that I'm a liar.
Natasha likes Razi, but he doesn't like her.
She tried committing suicide for him. She's after him. Razi isn't after her.
If you're still not aware of that then that is a shame.
Even after living in the same house, you're unaware of your sister's feelings.
You know what Hadia...
your speech won't have any effect on me.
Your deeds will be hidden behind this marriage. Natasha can be a fool, but not me.
One day... if not today, then tomorrow, I will prove all this.
Razi...
Can we talk for a minute?
What is it?
Did you give me that ring because you were compelled to?
There is no point in asking that question.
Razi, I feel embarrassed.
I think that my suicide threats and what my mother said compelled you to give that ring to me.
It's not like that Natasha, please...
Razi, I know that I'm not your ideal and you don't like girls like me.
You're right... I'm really sorry, but...
I don't like emotional girls like you, who are prone to giving suicide threats.
Anyways, you got what you wanted. There's no point in this anymore.
If you really want to change yourself for me, then, please...
become smart and mature. Try saying good things.
Make new friends, read books... have discussions. If you do all this...
then I'll start liking you more.
Anyways, how are you feeling now?
Better...
Good.
And yes, Farwa's wedding is near...
help her. Girls have a lot of problems, such as clothes, make-up...
Help her as a sister...
I will.
Good. I like responsible girls.
Be responsible. I'm going out to buy a few things. Do you want anything?
Actually, I wanted a dress for Farwa's wedding. If you could buy something for me...
Okay... farewell*
Fizza my dear...
Yes, father? You must be tired, should I bring you a glass of water?
No, my dear.
Forget about that and sit down.
Here you go.
Father, thank you so much.
You're most welcome my dear.
After so many days I've seen you so happy. Believe me...
that has made me very happy.
Don't worry. You won't be troubled by me anymore.
I will study hard.
I have full faith in you.
My dear... it's better if you forget about the past and think about your future.
God willing, you will become a big doctor someday. May God give you success.
Fizza.... my dear your phone has been ringing for a while.
It's my college friend, let me talk to her.
What is this?
Take a look.
Oh my... it's done?
Yes, our daughter's migration is done.
God willing, she'll go to a different university. By God's good graces, Fizza is very happy.
May God keep it that way.
May God give her success as well.
How are you?
I'm fine. Where are you? Do you know how many times I called you?
And you didn't call me back once. Your cousin came to university...
didn't he give you my message?
Yes...
brother Razi told me.
Still, you didn't call me, and you left your studies as well.
And you didn't even come to visit us.
I don't want to come there.
Whatever happened to me, I want to forget it.
I don't want to make any friends. Don't ever call me back.
Will you forget our friendship?
Fizza, listen to me.
Five crores? What are you saying?
There is nothing I can do to dispense such a large amount from the accounts.
My future depends on this.
Sir this is a matter of my life.
Mr. Faizan, minor thefts are okay, but committing fraud on such a large scale...
I cannot do that. If Mr. Safdar finds out he will have me thrown in jail for a lifetime.
You turned out to be useless. You have disappointed me.
I'm very compelled, please try to understand.
If that's the case, then sure. But there is something that you have to do.
Sir, don't let it be anything difficult. I don't have much domain.
Once I open up my office, I will give you all the powers.
Sir, if it's like that, then tell me what it is.
The thing you have to do is...
This is the phone number and all the details. Verify it for me and let me know.
Think that this is done.
Thanks.
But tell me something. First, it was that phone, and now it's this.
What's the deal?
There is a man at work who has run away after stealing some money.
We're tracking him.
Alright...
Don't worry... I will find out in a day or two and let you know.
Thank you...
There's an event going on and you're sitting here. Come outside.
You go ahead, what are you doing here?
I'm here to take you outside. If not for me, then do it for the world. Everyone is asking me where you are.
Then tell them the truth, I can't lie in front of the world like you. Father asked me to stay, otherwise, I would have left a long time ago.
This noise is giving me a headache.
Do you need medicine?
I need peace, can I get that?
Father asked me to go shopping with you tomorrow, for Farwa's wedding.
What should I tell him?
I'm busy, I don't have time for this. Go with either mother or Natasha.
I expected that much, but still, I thought I should ask.
I will tell father the same thing. If he asks you, tell him the same.
Close the door on your way out.
Razi...
Yes, mother?
Drink coffee.
You guys stayed up for so long last night. Farwa is still sleeping.
Mother, let her sleep...
Only two days are left till her wedding.
Yes... there's still a lot to do.
I feel worried thinking about it. There's still a lot to do at the market. How will we complete them all?
God willing, everything will be done.
Don't worry about it.
Tell me... did you go to the jeweler?
I'll go in the evening today.
Natasha said that she'll go with me. I'll take all of you together.
That's very good. We'll go altogether. They can buy whatever they like.
My dear, ask Safdar for a few days off from work.
Alright, I'll ask uncle that.
I want to visit my brother Aleem and give him the card personally.
Alright, mother... I don't think brother Aleem...
and his wife will come to the wedding.
That's why I want to go. I want to end all the complaints and misunderstandings.
Alright fine.
I'll take you to Hyderabad.
Tell me, have you created a list of all the guests?
Make sure that we don't forget anyone. If you forget something, ask me.
No mother, all the lists are done. I've saved them on my cellphone as well, don't worry
Alright fine. There's a lot to do, let me check in on them.
They are Hadia's in-laws, that's why I came. Otherwise, I would never have come here.
Forget about that Khadija...
Sister Sajda visited us from a long way to give us the invitation. We had to come here.
I've come here only because of her love and respect.
Otherwise, I don't even want to talk to anyone here.
You may be right about that. But Razi and sister Sajda are not at fault for anything that happened.
Besides, Razi is a respectful man.
He is an honorable man and he helped me that day.
Their only mistake is that they live here. If sister Sajda was living somewhere else...
then I would have helped her out. But I don't even feel like stepping foot inside this house.
You're right.
I think the marriage ceremony has been done.
It seems to be...
Give my sister the respect and love which every wife deserves.
Thank you.
Sister...
Thank God that everything went very well.
We can't thank God enough.
May God always keep our daughter happy in that place.
Amen... thank God who helped us fulfill my responsibility towards my daughter.
Thank you, Safdar, you have always helped me at every turn.
Don't embarrass me. It was all thanks to God that this happened.
Your son worked hard on it.
Yes, Safdar, I thank God...
for giving me, such obedient children.
No doubt.
Faizan... the way Razi participated in Farwa's wedding, will you do that for my wedding, or will you stay busy on your phone?
Faizan?
Was someone talking to me?
I'm really tired and I'm going to my room.
Safdar... Natasha is well now. Tell me...
when will you give me her wedding date?
Sister, she's your sister. You can take her away whenever you want.
Thank you. I expected this from you.
Greetings*
What is it?
Is this Fawad's home? I wanted to meet him.
He's not at home. Did you have something for him?
Actually, I was from his college. He's gotten a scholarship from us and I wanted to discuss that with him.
When will he be back?
He has left for Nawabshah.
Nawabshah? What does that mean?
He said that the college has sent him to study in Nawabshah for a few days.
Where is he staying in Nawabshah? Is he staying at a hostel or a relative's house? Can I get their number?
No... we don't have any relatives there. He calls sometimes.
He contacts the shop at the end of the corner.
Alright...
I'll come back after two months. You stay in contact with him, right?
Yes. If the college is asking for him, then he will surely come.
Sure... we'll call him. This is some money...
from the college. This is my...
visiting card. It has my number on it...
As soon as you contact him, please let me know. And I have a request...
don't tell Fawad about this. He'll be very happy when he gets this money as a surprise...
But be sure to contact him.
Yes, I will. Farewell*
Are you busy? Can I talk to you right now?
Sure brother Razi, what is it?
That man has run away to Nawabshah.
What? He's ran away?
But why, how... when?
I don't know that but...
he will come back. His mother would have told him by now and if he is greedy...
then he will come back soon.
But why did he run away?
Was he afraid of someone?
I don't know about that as well.
Anyways... don't worry about it, he will come back.

Trust me... tell me... what happened about your new admission?
Everything is done. I'm joining a different university starting tomorrow.
Great. Good luck. Don't worry, I'll update you as soon as that man comes back.
Leave this problem to me... one matter where he hides...
I will find him.
Sure. Farewell...
Good luck. Farewell.
