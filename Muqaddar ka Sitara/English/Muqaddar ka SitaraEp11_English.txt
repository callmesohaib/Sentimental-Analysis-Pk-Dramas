The groom looks very smart and rich.
Yes but he doesn't look happy. Look at his mother and sister. They seem upset.
Yes, they look arrogant. How will our simple Hadia manage?
what! He went for the wedding?
Yes even after I tried to make him understand, he went.
Our plan failed.
But?
But nothing.
Nothing can be done now, Ramsha.
And yes, you don't have to come to Pakistan right now.
I told him you were critical.
But he went ahead with the wedding even knowing that.
Yes. He heard that and yet he got married.
He's a very obedient son.
No. He isn't obedient.
His father is very stubborn. Now you'll have to talk to him.
Nothing can be done Ramsha.
I've already lied to Faizan to help you. If he finds out he'll boycott me as well.
Why are you standing here all alone?
Oh wait. I know.
What do you mean?
You thought dad would throw out Faizan and you'd be in luck.
And you'll take the place of his son directly.
But you're mistaken.
You cannot be his son or his son in law.
Understand this!
Seriously?
Listen,
I'm not at all interested in taking Faizan's place.
I'm happy in my place and my status
and as far as being Safdar uncle's son in law is concerned,
take out this misunderstanding out of your mind.
Even if you're the only girl in the world, I'll not marry you.
You got that?
Now what tradition is this?
You don't know about it. You'll have to drink this and give us a gift.
Take a sip. She's requesting.
Faizan take a sip and throw the money on her face.
Its just a sip Faizan. You know your dad will be upset.
Now happy?
Yes now give us the gift.
We will take twenty five thousand in cash.
For what?
Now this is how the tradition goes?
So much money for this milk? Come on..
Here take 50 thousand and now don't come back for anything more.
What will you get by being angry?
How many times did I tell you to stay away from Faizan?
You'll not get anything. But you didn't listen to me.
No mom. I know Faizan got married because his father pushed him.
He wouldn't have gotten married otherwise.
Come on Ramsha. Get back in your senses.
Had Faizan loved you even a little,
he wouldn't have married any other girl.
No mom. Faizan still loves me. His friend Zohaib told me.
So? When did Zohaib tell the truth? He's a liar himself.
He keeps sending you false news.
NO mom, Zohaib wouldn't lie to me. He's telling the truth.
I'm telling you Faizan got married because of a reason.
I will find out what that reason is.
Stupid girl.
I'm going.
Where?
To my friends.
Right now? Don't you know?
I'm exhausted. I need to relax. I'm going.
But...
What? I got married. Don't bother me anymore. What else should I do?
Sheena, both of you take Hadia inside.
Please dad. I'm really tired. I can't.
sister Sajida and Farwa, please take Hadia inside
and lets get done with everything. If there is any more never ending tradition that needs to be done.
Come dear.
I'll show you your room.
Come here. Your son doesn't leave any moment to insult me. What face will I show to Aleem?
Had there been someone else.
Enough Safdar!
didn't you know you forced him to get married.
Faizan got married now what more do you want?
Ramsha committed suicide because of Faizan.
What do you think? This is something small?
Faizan just got married an hour ago.
For God's sake give him some space.
Even I'm tired. I'm going inside.
Mom?
Will sister Hadia be treated this way?
What can we do?
This was a forced marriage.
Sheena shouldn't have done this.
Safdar has destroyed the life of both these kids because of his own happiness.
Not both but three.
Enough Farwa. Quiet.
Don't say this again.
Mom..
Enough. Don't argue.
Do you even know how dangerous this is?
God forbid if someone even gets a hint of it, that girl's life will be destroyed and,
even Razi will be accused.
And I don't want Safdar to think about it. I won't like it.
By the way,
my brother would have gotten his love,
if only you had said yes.
What could have happen if I had said yes?
Faizan's mother brought him back with his consent.
My Razi would have been hurt even more.
At least I didn't lose my pride.
And its fine. Whatever happened, happened for the best. My son isn't some lowlife that,
Now tell me will you stay awake all night that you're still up.
Half of the night has passed. I'll sleep after the morning prayers now.
Alright fine.
I'm too exhausted, I need to relax, I'm going.
But where?
Don't bother me anymore. I got married. What else should I do?
You know you forced him to get married and Faizan got married. Now what more do you want?
Faizan is disturbed because he was forced to marry me.
But why?
Hello?
How is Ramsha?
She was brought out of the ICU just now.
What did she do?
You're asking me what she did?
You promised you'd marry my daughter.
And you married someone else. Now you're asking me what happened to her?
You destroyed my daughter's life.
Tell me how she is. Make me talk to her.
If you're so worried, come here right now and look at her yourself.
Remember this,
if something happens to my Ramsha, I'll not spare you. I will not.
Now see how he comes running.
Good acting.
Where is he coming from?
I just got married.
What has he done to himself?
He's drunk. What has he done to himself?
Take him to the other room.
Come on sir.
In my room.
What nonsense is this? I'm warning you. Don't take him to the room where the bride is.
You're drunk. I want to..
Sir please. Let it be.
Take him away.
Yes sir.
Come on sir.
I got married today..
I don't understand how will I face that girl.
He hasn't left me able to show my face to anyone. Oh God, forgive me.
Uncle, don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Please go and get some rest. Its very late.
Please.
Hadia..
Hadia..
Oh God. What sort of a dream was this?
Is my daughter really in trouble right now?
Did I make a big mistake marrying her to a bold person like Faizan?
No. This cannot be.
Safdar promised me that he'll look after my daughter.
He will not let her get hurt.
Faizan too will change with time.
Mom.. these are the sweets.
Oh wow. So many things. I was thinking we'd get the breakfast items from Karachi.
Maybe they'd like those.
They wouldn't need our breakfast and even if we got stuff from Karachi, they'll find faults with it.
I'm doing everything for my daughter. She must be waiting for us.
If you're done preparing,
you should get ready as well.
Dear why are you standing here? Get ready.
Yes sure, I'll get ready. I send Guddu to get savories for her. Why aren't you ready yet?
So you're getting everything your sister liked.
Okay, I'll go and get ready.
You know we tried to take some good stuff.
Mom and I couldn't sleep all night. We were busy making the arrangements for this.
Fine dear. Get everything done. Its best if we reach on time, alright?
I'll go and change as well.
Hadia?
Hello.
Please sit dear. I came to ask,
if you can change we'll have breakfast together
and tell me what do you like to eat I'll make that for you.
Nothing. Just tea.
Fine. I'll ask Farwa to get your clothes. What would you wear dear?
Anything.
I'll ask Farwa to help you get ready.
May you be blessed.
Whatever I was afraid of happened.
The reason I brought them here from America happened here as well.
He wasn't in his room last night.
In fact he shouldn't be with Hadia in that condition.
What would she think?
What if she tells brother Aleem something.
I don't want them to know Faizan's reality just now.
They will find one day so why not today.
What are you saying?
Have some fear.
You brought someone else's daughter here, at least show her some respect.
You and Natasha should have visited her but you didn't.
Now tell me what do you want?
What is there to say Sheena?
Do one thing. Both of you, you and Natasha should go see her and convince her that last night his friend got into an accident.
He went there in a hurry and when he got back he got food poisoning.
Say anything but she shouldn't find out the truth.
Sorry Safdar, I cannot do this.
Why can't you?
Sheena the place where my children are standing today is because of you
because I left their upbringing to you.
Both of you should have been there but instead my sister and Farwa took her to her room.
Please solve this matter. Go.
Go to her room and talk to her. Please I'm asking you.
Go please, go to her room before brother Aleem and his wife comes.
Wow. You look pretty in simplicity as well.
Are you ready?
What is this you're wearing?
Does a bride dress like this?
You must have brought this from your home, I guessed only looking at it.
Have you ever seen a bride look like this?
I've never helped a bride get ready. I'll get something from what you brought.
Let it be. Her family has already come. They'll be happy no matter how she looks.
We'll go see the dining table then.
By the way, did you ask them to bring breakfast?
I've told them no a hundred times but they dare never listen.
Faizan didn't come to his room last night. Even we were worried.
But his friend got into an accident and he's still in the ICU.
You will not tell this to your family.
Good girls don't let their family know what goes on in her in laws.
Do you understand or not?
Now come downstairs.
Its surprising brother Aleem. You didn't stop with the antiquated tradition of getting the bride breakfast.
It seems you want your younger daughter to marry into a family like ours.
You did all this hard work to bring breakfast and now you'll stay till tonight for the reception.
We will be going back.
Hadia, go take your mother and Fizza to see your room after breakfast.
Please start.
Yes. Sure.
I cannot eat all this oily food. I'll take fruits only.
Oh wow. You have such a beautiful room.
Praise to the Lord.
By the way, your father got this Rosewood furniture made for you on urgent basis.
It was a little expensive but do you like it?
Do you have to ask? Its very important for me.
I'll keep them close to my heart.
We shouldn't keep things close to our hearts but relations.
Hadia where is Faizan?
He is habitual of sleeping in late and so is Natasha, so both of them weren't there for breakfast.
But where is he? This is his room right.
He went to the other room to sleep when he heard you people were coming so that you wouldn't be disturbed.
Dear is everything fine?
Let everything be, tell me what did you get as a wedding gift.
Fizza!
Mom come sit please. Come.
brother Aleem I apologize. I'm embarrassed. Please don't mind what Sheena said.
No Safdar its nothing. I was just..
She isn't bad at heart.
Its just she has a strict attitude. Its best if we ignore her.
I can understand Safdar.
I wanted to meet Faizan so I could ask how he was feeling.
Of course. There's no harm in that but he took medicine and slept.
Don't worry. You'll meet him in the event tonight.
Of course we'll meet him there.
Please call Fizza and Khadijah. Its a long trip back and we need to get some work done.
Yes sure. Khaliq? Khaliq
Yes sir?
Call Fizza and sister in law, brother Aleem has to get back.
Okay sir..
So all arrangements done for the evening?
Everything will be done when you come and grace the event with your presence.
As God wills.
