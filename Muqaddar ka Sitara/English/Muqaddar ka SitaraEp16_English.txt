Dad have you forgiven me?
May be I'll make a lot of mistakes in the beginning but we learn this way, isn't it?
But if I get your guidance and trust, I'll learn to overcome my mistakes. Please trust me.
And if you find it right, you can send me in your place.
Alright then,
get ready to go to Malaysia.
Hadia will go with you.
Dad what will Hadia do there?
Its an official tour. We'll be working. She'll be bored.
But you guys got married recently. She'll look around as an excuse.
I'll get her visa urgently.
But she doesn't have a passport. I don't think it can be done this urgently.
Alright you go ahead. Next time.
Thank you dad.
Have you understood Mr. Asif?
Yes sir, I've understood.
Razi please come and sit down.
You called uncle?
Yes dear, this is Hadia's passport. Get her an urgent visa, don't care about the money.
Hadia's passport. For what?
Sorry dear, I forgot to tell you. I should have told you earlier.
Faizan is going to Malaysia.
I know nobody could have done this better than you
but Faizan needs to learn right.
He proclaims he'll be able to do big things but I'll know whether he is capable or not.
Yes. Yes.
Thank you dear. Thank you.
I'll get it done.
Okay dear.
What does uncle think of me?
He doesn't care for my respect or my emotions.
That day he wanted to sacrifice me because his son was being stubborn.
And he didn't even apologize
and now..
it was such a good chance for my career and he gave it to Faizan.
There's no payback for my hard work and sacrifices.
Mom, where have you brought us?
Uncle is as selfish as his wife and children.
Are you really going to Malaysia?
Wow amazing. What will you get for me? How many days are you going for?
Only four days?
Its your honeymoon you should go for about two weeks at least.
Alright, I'll tell mom. Bye.
Mom?
Yes dear?
Do you know Hadia is going to Malaysia for her honeymoon?
Really?
Yes.
Oh wow. Is she happy?
Yes dad. She's very happy.
See I told you our daughter will be very happy there.
Thank God.
You didn't make me talk to Hadia, Fizza?
Yes mom I wanted to but she needed to pack. She said she'll call before she leaves.
Do you guys want tea?
Sure.
I'll just get it.
Thank you God.
Please keep our daughter happy always.
What are you doing? You're packing for yourself? Where is Faizan?
Do you know she's going to Malaysia with you?
What? No. No way?!
Who told you you're going with me? Did you talk to dad yourself?
You don't even have a passport? How did you get a visa?
Don't you know?
Uncle got it made on urgent basis through Razi.
What is this? I will not take her along. Talk to dad.
Either she goes or I'll not go.
My trip will be destroyed. Talk to him.
Its the limit. Your husband is insulting you and yet you're adamant to go.
Do you know how much your uncle is upset with Faizan?
And now since he has a chance to get himself recognized why are you interfering?
I will not disturb him.
What do you mean you'll not disturb me? You will not disturb me when you go with me.
Mom, all my trip is planned and my friends are aligned as well. Please.
This is the limit.
Its not even your fault.
You came from Hyderabad to Karachi for the first time and now since you're getting a chance for an international trip for the first time, why will you turn it down?
This isn't the last trip. You can go next time.
Faizan, you should compromise.
I am compromising. How much more do you want?
She's not going on the trip with me. That's it. Talk to dad.
You are absolutely shameless. I didn't realize that.
Alright I won't go.
Alright then go and tell your uncle?
What?
Yes, make an excuse. Tell your sister is getting engaged or something, lie.
Why should I lie?
As if you never lied before. What will one lie do?
Why don't you tell him that Faizan doesn't want to take me along?
Alright. I'll tell him something myself.
Ask her yourself. I've called her.
Uncle you called?
Sit dear.
What happened you're still here? Why didn't you go with Faizan?
Actually I had packed everything but then I felt sick.
Faizan wanted to cancel but I said I'd go next time.
Is that so?
Yes, you can ask auntie.
Yes Safdar she was unwell last night.
Alright.
Dear why do you call us uncle and auntie?
Call us mom or dad, mama or baba like Faizan and Natasha but not this. Please.
Okay dad.
Thank you dear. Please ask Parveen to send us two cups of tea.
I'll make it myself.
Why do you have to make it yourself? When we have so many servants...
Why should you do this?
Oh.. its nothing.
Whats wrong Sheena? If she wants to make it let her do that.
As it is, I get bored in the house. There's nothing to do here.
Hmm. So lets do one thing.
You'll take charge of the evening tea. You'll make it for us daily.
Of course. Why not?
I was just kidding. I just want you to stay busy because you get bored.
In fact do one thing.
You should manage things around the house. Take a few things as your responsibility. It'll kill your boredom.
So wasn't it being managed before?
Of course they are being managed Sheena. What I mean is that Sheena she'll help you around and her boredom will be treated as well.
Also, Hadia if you want to change something, ask Farwa, she'll help you.
Thank you dad. I'll get tea for both of you.
Sure.
At least leave an opportunity. Once at least.
Mom? Mom.. See whose there.
What happened?
Oh Faizi.. You. All praise to the Lord.
Thank God, you're here. She has destroyed yourself crying for you.
That's why I'm here.
If you give us permission, I want to take her for dinner.
No. You must be tired.
Sit down and I'll make dinner for you.
Actually I have no time. I have a flight for Malaysia at night.
I had a connecting flight. I got time in transit so I want to spend it with her.
Alright, its your wish.
But be careful. She's still weak. See how much she's glowing looking at you.
She was absolutely drained a little while ago.
Of course I can see.
I'll go get ready. You talk to mom.
Sure.
Come sit.
Hurry up.
She was so unwell. I was so worried. I didn't understand what to do with her.
Oh wow Ramsha. You were absolutely right.
So you now believe me?
Who else will I believe if not you. But do something strong this time.
Don't you worry.
Try to make him stay for two days at least. And,
tell me one thing. Why is he here? Is everything alright?
Look at him. Does it feel something's wrong?
He seems absolutely fine. And now don't doll up so much. You just came back from the hospital.
Oh I forgot that. Should I lessen the lipstick?
No let that be. You look good. Tell Faizan you got ready for him.
Just be careful when you walk. Walk slowly and don't eat anything spicy.
Tell him the doctor allowed you a few things to eat only.
Wow you told me a great thing.
Who will tell you something good, if not I?
Now I'm going to sit with him, get ready and come down. I'm excited.
What do you think, should we set this portion?
Why not?
What if aunties scolds me?
Why would she?
When the head of the family has allowed you, why would she scold you? Do whatever you like.
And you're their daughter in law you have all the right to do what you like.
Alright, lets start then.
Fine, where should we start?
I think lets start from here.
Call Hadia and ask. She might have reached Malaysia by now.
She had a morning flight, didn't she.
Yes she did.
She didn't go.
She got food poisoning and brother Faizan went all alone.
Oh God. My child.
I don't know why mom, I think Hadia is lying.
Brother Faizan must have left her here deliberately.
No dear this is wrong.
You're accusing Faizan without a reason.
As it is its not easy to get a visa. You don't know the mess.
Oh I'm so tired. But it was fun. Now this room has become worthy of seating.
What do you think? Will auntie be happy and let me set the other parts of the house?
Why won't she? You changed the look of this room without spending anything. She will not object.
Then? Do you want to do more right now or tomorrow?
Alright, lets do it.
You're enjoying as well. Come on.
Who made all these paintings?
Brother Razi made these.
He's very creative.
Even though he studied the dry subject, business administration but he didn't quit painting.
Farwa?
yes Mom, I'm coming. I'll just listen to mom and come.
You? What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You threw this picture
but what about the picture in my heart?
I hate you.
You're lying.
You didn't hate me.
I saw the true colors of love in your eyes for myself, Hadia.
You thought my love was not much important since Faizan was so rich?
Those who flirt often blame others. I'm not at all surprised.
And the only purpose you have these pictures is to get me insulted in front of Faizan.
You're accusing me Hadia.
You're not doing right.
You threw away this picture but what about the picture in my heart?
You're here and I was looking for you everywhere.
Mom made tea and fritters. Lets have them.
You go ahead. I'll freshen up and come.
Alright.
I hate you.
Those who flirt often blame others. I'm not surprised at what you said.
Afzal look at the plants, they have wilted.
They'll be better once I separate the weeds. I'm looking after them but..
Whats happening here?
Sheena auntie, Hadia..
You be quiet. I'm not asking you. I'm asking Hadia.
How dare you make changes in my garden?
Please leave from here.
Yes mam.
Only whatever I want will happen in this house.
Safdar allowed you to kill your boredom but you!
You got serious about changing how the house looks!
If you want to work, go help Najma in the kitchen.
And you, why are you always surrounding her?
She's our daughter in law. She'll stay here. But you, you're a guest. Stay like a guest.
Keep everything back in its place.
sister Hadia,
yes
I'm so sorry you got scolded because of me.
You were not at fault.
Its all my fault. I advised you that we'd set the lawn.
Don't be stupid. Come,
lets ask brother Afzal to keep everything back.
Everything looked so good.
Its alright. Lets get this back.
Why did she say this to me mom?
I feel as if she is under a big misunderstanding from my side.
What could be misunderstood now?
Mom, even I don't understand this.
I was shocked when she called me a cheat.
Every girl says this later since they don't have anything else to say.
Its easy to accuse others.
No mom. Its not that.
What I mean to say is,
I feel as if there was a big misunderstanding between us.
Really! And who would that be?
See dear, you wouldn't be able to find the one who created the misunderstanding and the reason.
Razi, dear, she is married now. 
Even if the misunderstanding between you two is cleared,
it might make a soft corner in her heart for you 
and this won't be correct for the two of you. 
Don't act like the devil dear. 
Don't weigh out your entire life for this temporary love.
What happened to you?
I don't know what is auntie's problem.
Its very wrong. She's elder than you. Show some respect.
So she should also realize that. 
She competes for the smallest of things.
Will you tell me what actually happened?
Mom, uncle allowed sister Hadia in front of you to make changes in the house. Right?
Yes then?
So sister Hadia was changing the plants. She wanted flowers. Sheena came and said no. Saying no is okay.
But so much insult. She insulted her in front of everyone and took me under fire as well.
She told me you're a guest and stay like a guest. 
She said she hated me being with Hadia all the time.
So she's right. Why do you have to tag with her all the time?
When she's saying so, stay away.
Mom you know how lonely she is. Neither Natasha, nor aunt gives her any company.
And not even brother Faizan.
That's not your problem dear. This is how this house is. Everybody is busy with their own work.
When Sheena has told you not to talk to her. Be careful in the future.
What is this? I will not take her. Talk to dad. 
My trip will be spoilt. Its not going to happen. Talk to him.
Its been 24 hours since Faizan left but he didn't even call once.
He didn't even inform if he had reached safely.
Hello Faizan? Have you reached?
What are you doing? 
I have my flight in a little while. I'll be flying to Malaysia and you're on the phone. Why?
Faizi I want to spend my life with you.
We'll spend our lives as well. But right now lets dance.
Faizi leave me. I'm okay here.
No. I'm not okay without you.
Faizi what are you doing? We just came and you'll leave?
I have a plane to catch. Connecting flight.
I cannot be late. I just have this time.
Faizi please. Just stay back a little.
I wish I could but I cannot. 
I'll be in trouble if I get late.
This means you don't value me anymore.
What are you talking about! I took such a big risk for you. 
and you are saying that I don't value you. 
If dad finds out, he'll disown me. I earned his trust with so much difficulty.
I just want this meeting to be successful so that I can come here again and again. And dad trusts me more.
Faizi, will we always live away from each other? 
You in Pakistan and me in Dubai. How long will this go on?
No. We'll be together. I have to go now. I'm getting late. Ramsha?
Okay. I'll stay for a while but then you won't stop me. Promise?
Promise?
 I'll get more to drink. Do you want something?
Oh no..
Hadia called? Did you answer? 
I'm asking you. Did you answer?
Yes.
Why?
Because I wanted to.
You didn't wrong. This is wrong. You shouldn't have.
Why? You didn't tell Hadia about me?
Its not the problem. The problem is if she tells dad, everything will be ruined. The trust I earned. You just ruined it.
Why?
Oh come on Faizi. Does that girl hold more importance for your dad than you?
If your father asks you something, just lie to him. 
And if she asks you anything, just give her a shut up call. 
She shouldn't have the worth to question you.
I took such a big risk coming here, you have no idea
and rather than being happy, you're spying on me. You've disappointed me Ramsha.
Accept it that you saw Hadia's name and answered the call. Just don't lie to me.
Say you're sorry.
I'm sorry Faizi. 
I'll not do it again. Lets forget it and enjoy please.
You've ruined it. This will not happen again.
 I made a mistake. I shouldn't have come.
Faizi, listen to me. Faizi?!!!
