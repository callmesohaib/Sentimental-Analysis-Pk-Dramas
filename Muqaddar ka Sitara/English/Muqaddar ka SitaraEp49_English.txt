oh mom, what happen?
get me water
oh God! you had gone to uncle so happily then what happened?
nothing is right
I am not getting positive vibes
from whom?
Safder & Sheena, whom else?
what are you saying? I am not getting anything
what shall I tell you?
Sheena
Sheena is asking for Razi's proposal
what!
what are you saying, mom?
have you refused?
yes
thank God!
but... 
but now Safder
Natasha wants to get married with Razi
and you know how Sheena is
she loves her daughter a lot
she will make our life a living hell!
I'm afraid, what if she harms my son
God forbid
but mom, what will we do now?
what was the need to talk to my sister?
why! You wanted Natasha to marry Razi, right?
then what is the objection now?
 it was a different matter at that time. Our daughter was unmarried
she is a divorcee now
the nerve, Safder!
if you will use this word for your daughter, then others will also get a chance
I am showing you the mirror, Sheena
and I am telling you the truth that I have seen with my eyes
Natasha is in love with Razi now, she had shared her feelings with me
then you should have explained her
or at least, you should have talked to me before talking to my sister
why I should have talked to you? if your daughter likes someone then what's the harm in it?
and now its your own nephew Razi, with whom you want to marry her
really!
this is what you are saying!
who used to point out all the demerits in him
I have digested this bitter truth for the sake of my daughter's happiness
its of no use now, the situation has been changed
the situation hasn't changed at all! They are still under the burden of our favors
stop it Sheena!
tell me one thing
what do they want to prove by rejecting Natasha?
whatever they have is given to them by us
you are exaggerating the matter!
I will talk to Natasha myself & will tell her not to think in this manner or be stubborn about it
this is not her contumacy but her wish
whatever it is, whether contumacy or wish
I will explain my daughter in both the matters
if something is not possible then it is not!
as far as Natasha is concerned
 her happiness is more precious to me than anything in this world
because she is my only daughter
fine! try talking to her
she won't agree
what kind of a problem is this!
our fate is so bad, happiness doesn't suit my children
don't worry
God willing, God will make a way out
I must say, we'll talk to aunt Sheena & uncle face to face once brother Razi comes
call Razi
and ask him where is he. Tell him to come home quickly
yes, I am doing it. Please don't worry so much, your blood pressure will shoot up
please drink water
Okay
I'm fine
shall I give you medicine?
yes
what will happen!
Razi!
you cannot marry me because I am a divorcee?
right?
you have the right to refuse, Razi
but tell me yourself
just because of my single mistake
can't I do something good in my life ever?
I cannot spend a good life
Natasha, when have I said that?
if you haven't said that then accept me
I love you a lot, Razi
what are you saying? people will hear
I don't care!
I don't care about anyone anymore
actually, I don't care about myself
if you didn't say 'yes' to marry me, then I... 
I will kill myself
Natasha... 
and I'm damn serious about it!
please don't do this, what non-sense!
what is this childish attitude? What is this misbehavior!
this is not a childish act!
as I said, I love you & I cannot live without you
Natasha please! think wisely.. 
come down for two minutes, we'll talk in peace Ok?
what will we talk about?
Natasha
nobody will come inside
Natasha, open the door
otherwise, I will kill myself
Natasha!
uncle, look at Natasha... 
what is she doing!
what is this happening?
Natasha, come down you will fall!
Natasha!
dad, please don't stop me
I will kill myself today
Razi doesn't loves me, he will not marry me & I cannot live without him
Natasha, please don't do any such thing!
look! I will talk to Razi
I promise, he will marry you
but please come down
mom please stop lying to me, even aunt doesn't want this to happen
dear, have some mercy on me please. Please come down
dad, I'm telling you. I cannot live without Razi
I will change myself as per his choice, but he is not agreeing
sister, if something happened to my daughter then I will never forgive you
dear Razi, please solve this matter for the sake of expedience
yes uncle
Natasha!
fine! I am ready for this marriage
I know, you are saying this to save me. You guys are lying to me
I am not lying! see... 
look! I've also brought a ring for you. I wanted to surprise you
come down please!
Natasha please come down, listen to your father
Natasha... please
I'm coming
Natasha!
Natasha... 
where is it!
don't know where have I kept it
where it has gone?
why are you sitting here with the bundle of documents?
I don't know where... 
have I kept my ID card, I've been searching for it since so long bu I can't find it
you should have asked me, I would have told you. 
I know where is it
wait, I am bringing it
I've been looking for it madly since so long
oh God!
anyways... 
here you go
thank you!
I had completely lost my mind while searching for it
by the way, why were you searching your ID card?
I'm thinking to go & get Fizza's migration done to another university
so that she can start her studies once again
yes, one more thing. Don't tell her about it
let she get the admission first, and let me find a hostel for her
then together we'll give her this good news
yes
better, I won't tell her
but Fizza's documents are with her, how will do it?
don't worry, Fizza's documents are already with me
aren't we hurrying in getting her admission done once again?
don't know why
I'm scared of these educational institutions
since Fizza had experienced this accident
I start fearing by thinking that she will join another college
I feel scared
yes
you are right
even I was scared
but after looking at Fizza's bravery & courage, even I've gained confidence
and how wisely she did this decision of her life
I think, we should appreciate her
you also give her courage so that she shall become successful in her motive
God willing
Okay... 
had they contacted again?
No, it didn't happen
its good!
be careful... 
it is better not have such kind of contact
let she get the admission first
God willing Fizza will handle everything on her own
yes, sure
Ok, let me clear this mess now
thanks to God!
hello!
at least.. its not a big deal
its a matter of 40 million
at least get the stock released
I can give you 10% profit
on 40 million
Okay
understand, brother Salik?
yes
bro, I am so happy
if brother Salik helped you, then you will beat Safder uncle in the business world
hey you!
what are you saying?
man! I'm not joking. Stop laughing, you start laughing on every matter
brother, I'm serious. Didn't you see that guy
he gave 10% profit on an investment of 40 million
I wish I had that much amount then I would be earning so easily
I mean the guy seems legit
yes, of course he is
in fact, I am thinking to take 5 crores from you & do an investment with Salik
from me? a loan?
can't you do this much for your friend?
just think, do the math
I will give 5 crores, and we'll get a profit of 50 lacs on it. Right brother?
slowly & gradually I will return your money
dear, at that time I had asked you many times to get married
if you had listened to me on that day, then we wouldn't have to face this day
did you see?
what that crazy girl has done to herself
you are so late
Natasha like Razi
even he?
I pray to God that Natasha must be fine
do get an idea from his talks that what he has decided
if he will give the money to Salik
then its confirmed then
first of all explain me
that how will he give the money?
he doesn't even have a single penny
you are right. He doesn't have his own money
but he gathers the money somehow by doing different frauds
even he spends a lot of money on his luxuries
and he will arrange the money for sure for such kind of offer
I don't know Zohaib, but I don't find any direct profit in this
really!
do you think his intentions will change after taking 50 lacs every month?
yes?
its just the matter of time
you'll see, he will do a big fraud with his dad's account
and that big fraudulent amount will come to you
hmm... 
so, do you accept that I am your best friend?
well Ms. Ramsha millionaire
don't forget your friend
absolutely not!
you are such a greedy person
hello!
calm down Faizan, where are you? What happen?
Ok fine, send me the location I'm coming
yes
what happen?
don't know Faizan is calling me
I'm not greedy, aunty
stupid guy!
he is making us a fool
relax mom, we'll see. First let our work get done
he wants his share
leave him!
I've been calling your incompetent son since so long
but he isn't responding at all!
great! now he has switched it off
what kind of a son he is?
what kind of a brother he is?
his sister is in the hospital & what is he doing!
how would he know that his sister is in the hospital?
instead of calling him, you are cursing your son
what else shall I do?
God had to give me such an incompetent children
I don't understand anything
what's with you, Safder? Is this the right time to say such things?
leave it
sister, they haven't left me a chance
look, we've reached to this extent because of all of them
I don't understand anything
its a hospital, please
aunt... 
aunt, I've brought juice for you. Please drink it
I don't want!
you are already in stress, you will fall sick please
as I said, I don't need your false sympathies!
I am not showing sympathy
I am really worried about you
there is nothing to worry about
her arm got fractured, and there is a minor injury on the left leg
thanks to God that there hasn't been any major loss
thanks to God a million times
the main thing is that there isn't any serious head injury
but still we need to get her scans done
sure! do whatever you feel is better
Can we meet her?
yes sure, you can go
come
my child...
Natasha, what was this? what if something would have happened to you then?
what's her fault in it?
all of this is done by your nephew & sister
what was the problem if your sister hadn't refused for the marriage?
as it is, his son is not someone very special
what quality my daughter lacks?
stop it Sheena!
at least think before you speak, you start everywhere!
be quiet!
how can you ask me to be quiet?
who would have been responsible if something would have happened to my daughter?
mom, I am responsible
its my mistake
aunt & Razi aren't our slaves
that whatever we will ask them to do, they will do
Razi has got complete right to refuse
and aunt has got complete right to chose her daughter in law
the entire fault is mine
I consider it my right to achieve everything
dad, I'm really sorry
I want to apologize to you for all of my mistakes
actually I have started to fall in love with Razi
and have started to become like the same person as he wants me to be
the way he took me out of Sherry's trap
I thought, maybe he will accept me too
but its not necessary
I can be his very good cousin too
Razi, I'm really sorry
I won't force you anymore
you are free to marry the person of your choice
how can he back off so easily?
he had said at home that he will marry you. Also, he had brought a ring for you
make her wear the ring then!
there is no need of it, Sheena
our daughter has realized her mistake, & that's enough for us
I am proud of my daughter
stay blessed dear
and don't ever do this mistake ever, please!
I had almost lost my life!
my son will not back off
if he has agreed to marry
then he will marry for sure
yes!
make her wear the ring
congratulations to you too Razi
first uncle has pressurized me & now you
at least you should have supported me
what do you mean?
if you were not agreed for this proposal then
why were you showing that ring to Natasha?
mom, I had brought that ring for Farwa not for Natasha
I had lied to Natasha, in order to save her life
please
I don't want to marry Natasha
if I had to marry Natasha, then I wouldn't have asked to look for a proposal for me
what happen? what did the doctor said? are the scans report here?
sister, the scanning report will take some time. And for now, they want to keep Natasha under observation
dear Razi, do one thing
take them home as its quite late night
I will bring Sheena as well
No uncle, I request you
take mom & aunt home, I'm here
I will call to inform you about the reports
but dear...
Razi is right, he will stay here
uncle please
don't worry, I'm telling you
I will not leave Natasha alone
ok fine, do keep in contact with me on the phone
yes
ok fine, do keep in contact with me on the phone
sister, let me bring Sheena
and you also take care of yourself
yes mom
how are you feeling now?
I'm better
where is dad?
they have gone home
since there is a lot of time for the reports, so I will inform them as soon as we get the reports
you didn't go?
somebody had to stay here with you
Razi
are you angry with me?
presently you need to rest, Natasha
do rest
we'll talk once you get better
yes, come in
thank you!
Razi please no
No

don't you want to recover early?
if you want to go home early then you have to eat
please, have some
ok little
yes, its already less
yes
mom
where is everyone? Why there is so much silence at home?
at the hospital
what!
at the hospital! why? Is everything alright?
how is mom & dad? 
Hadia tell me what happened?
Natasha had fallen on the terrace
what! how and...
Ok tell me which hospital? And why nobody had informed me?
at least check your phone, I did so many calls & messages to you
my phone's battery had died. Ok tell me, she is in which hospital?
you will get to know only if you stay at home, but you are never at home
sorry dad, my phone was off. 
Are you fine?
what happen? I hope she isn't badly injured
I'm good
No, its a small fracture
Natasha sit
yes, she will be fine within a week's time
but the desire she had in her mind has been fulfilled
means?
I mean, right don't worry about her injury just congratulate her
for what?
we have engaged Natasha & Razi
what!
Natasha & Razi's engagement, means?
how? I mean how can you do this?
but it has been done
congratulations man!
I'm your to be brother in law, now you have to pay me respect
I have an objection on this engagement
but Faizan, you don't have any right to object
when mom, dad & aunt is happy in my happiness then you also stay happy
Natasha is right
don't argue with him, talk to me whatever you want to say
and participate in your sister's joyous occasion
