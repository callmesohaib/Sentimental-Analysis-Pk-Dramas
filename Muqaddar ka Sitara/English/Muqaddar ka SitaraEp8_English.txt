The groom is so handsome.
Even the bride is so gorgeous.
Yes, they have a beautiful couple.
Please smile.
Alright, whoever wants to start off with the festivities should come on the stage. 
Natasha please you start.
Give sweets to your brother.
Faizan, now you'll not be spared. Eat. Come on eat.
Alright, sorry. Last time. Sorry. Last time.
Now come here.
Whats wrong with you? I told you I didn't like all this.
Whatever man!
What is all this? I'm really not in the mood. I'm doing it all because of uncle.
Please be quiet. Whats wrong? What can we do? 
See, I also dressed up for your uncle's happiness.
Just fix your mood. He shouldn't feel anything. Understood what I'm saying.
Oh, you're here. Whats wrong with you? 
Please look after the guests and where is Razi?
Dear go and receive Mr. Hamdani. I have to look after everything myself.
Razi was right here.
He isn't feeling well so he might have gone to get medicine.
What happened? He could have asked the driver.
Why did he have to go himself? You know I have under so much pressure today. 
And why do you have the long face?
Uncle...
What uncle? Please go and receive the guests. I'll go and receive Mr. Hamdani.
yes we are going
Come on be quiet.
Enough. Are you done with everything? Are you at peace? Can I go now?
Let the event be over?
What? 
You promised that you'd not let all this foolishness happen with me. 
You didn't listen to me. Why should I listen to you?
Faizan?
Fizza I feel anxious. I feel something terrible is about to happen.
Come on. We're done with the Mehendi event peacefully. Safdar arranged everything well.
Did you see the food? There was ample for everyone. I ate my fill.
Oh yes, he was insisting we stay there because it was late but I didn't find it appropriate to stay at my daughter's in laws' house.
And then he said he'd get us a hotel booking but I didn't agree. He has a big heart.
He didn't hold back from arranging the best event.
Because we agreed to whatever they said. They will now take care of us.
Its not that now. 
His son in one in a million and he has ample girls around him.
Now its something else that they liked Hadia. That's our good fortune.
Good fortune?
What is fortunate about this? Did you see Faizan's attitude?
And his wife and sister? They didn't even look at us forgetfully.
We are his son's in laws.
What difference does it make? We have nothing to do with them. Unless Faizan himself..
Faizan? 
Hadia's dad.. we've already seen Faizan being so ill mannered.
I'm amazed that you cannot see them.
I'm amazed Khadijah that you're after one thing only.
Come on, he's their only son. He comes from a rich family and has been brought up in America. 
Its only been a little while that they came here.
He will take time to learn the ways of our society and our Hadia will assist him in this.
And as far as Sheena and her daughter are concerned, all mother and sister in laws are like this.
Tell me the truth, had you found a match for your daughter here in Hyderabad,
 wouldn't you fear the same for your daughter from her mother or sister in law?
Faizan will get better. Don't worry. 
As it is, what do you think, would I get my daughter married in a house where she'd be unhappy?
I hope it is so.
Please eat something.
Get me some poison.
Why are you saying this?
You knew Fizza? Tell me the truth, did you know?
Had I known, I would have told you. Why would I hide?
How can it be? Such a big deception.
It was a deception. We misunderstood.
Did he tell you he came from America or that he was Safdar uncle's son or that his name was Faizan?
See, he didn't say anything.
But mom and dad..
Why would they lie to you?
But then did Safdar uncle lie?
No. Nobody lied. They didn't show as if they lied or hid something.
And even mom dad didn't even feel as if they're meeting Faizan for the first time.
Then who was the guy who came to our house and expressed his interest in me?
He was Razi. He is Safdar uncle's nephew.
Why didn't he tell me who he was? Why didn't he tell me his name?
What do I know?
He came to our house. He called me so many times. 
He said he would send his mother, but why didn't he?
And why didn't he tell Safdar uncle that he liked me?
Can you tell mom?
He's a man. He can tell.
He didn't do good. 
Why did this happen with me Fizza? I never hurt anyone. 
If he wasn't written for me then why,
why did he made me fall in love with him?
He was flirting with you.
Had he loved you, he would have brought his family. 
He lives with Safdar uncle. Wouldn't he know?
Didn't he know that Safdar uncle was bringing a proposal for you from Faizan?
That's why its useless to cry for such a man. Whats done is done.
Have your breakfast. Hadia..
Razi, come on, your uncle is calling for breakfast.
No mom. I'm not hungry.
Why wouldn't you? You haven't eaten anything since last night. You'll get ill.
Let me fall ill.
I'm not in the mood.
Brother, look at me.
You didn't even sleep all night. You kept missing her.
Razi, why are you punishing yourself? When you know Hadia cannot be yours.
She now belongs to Faizan. Forget her now.
Mom, I'm tired of making him understand this.
She doesn't belong to you. Don't miss her now.
I loved her with all my heart and if you love someone so much, you cannot forget them.
You loved her truly but she, she made fun of your love.
She hurt your feelings. Don't miss her so much.
For God's sake Razi, my child. Try and understand.
We cannot do anything that's why we're quiet.
Please go. I'll eat later. Please leave me alone right now.
Please.
How did you like the function last night?
It was amazing. More than we expected. Otherwise something or the other usually happens at weddings.
You just need to have money and it solves everything. Nothing stays amiss, nothing goes wrong.
Didn't you see, Faizan's in laws didn't object to anything.
Hmm. Dear, Farwa, did you enjoy?
Yes uncle. I enjoyed a lot.
Thank God. You'll see how I get Razi married like this with all the pomp and then you and Natasha.
Sure.
Where are Faizan and Razi both? I haven't seen them.
Razi hasn't been feeling well since last night. He said he would be late for work as well.
Oh my God, whats wrong with you? Faizan..
Are you okay?
No. I'm not okay. Its because of all of you.
I did tell you that don't put henna on me but you didn't even listen to me. 
You have no sense to organize a function.
This keeps happening in wedding and all these events are important as well.
Nothing happens. All this is nonsense and nothing else.
Language. She is your aunt Faizan.
I'm sorry dad but Faizan is absolutely right.
But yesterday, the bride's family misbehaved. Faizan tolerated everything. 
Had it been me, I would have broken someone's hand or feet.
I'm telling you clearly, if something similar happens to be during the wedding, I'll not tolerate it and I'll walk out.
Have breakfast at least.
Excuse me.
Yes, Hadia's family crossed all limits yesterday.
When has a groom fallen sick like this?
He just has an allergy. Can you recommend some medicine? Oh I just remembered,
you made a herbal tea.
I'll make it. He'll be fine in an hour.
Yes, please make that for him.
Let it be, I'll give him medicine.
Alright. I'll just leave. Ask Razi to freshen up and join me in the office.
Okay.
You should also ask Faizan to seriously take the business and meet me in the office.
 He is now getting married. Alright. Bye.
By the way mom, did you know, Christianity doesn't have these useless traditions. They have simple weddings.
Yes, we have these useless, outdated traditions. What can I say?
Enough, how much will you cry?
Maybe all my life.
God forbid. Don't say like this. 
You'll always be happy, if God wills.
How will I be happy Fizza?
How will be I happy with a man who I don't love? The man I don't know. 
I cannot tell you whats going on in my heart.
I am marrying someone else, while I love someone else.
Please don't be so loud. If mom hears us, it'll be chaotic.
What about what is going on in my heart? Nobody cares about that.
Its very late.
Accept brother Faizan as your fate.
So easily?
What else can you do?
I'll talk to mom and dad. I cannot get married.
sister!
Mom. What are you doing?
You're saying no to this wedding?
Why? What happened in a day that you're saying no now?
You were against me saying no until yesterday. What happened now?
Mom.. its not that..
If its not that then are my ears deceiving me? Am I lying?
I kept saying no to your father, only to avoid embarrassment but you..
now you're saying no to the wedding one day before the wedding.
 Wow Hadia. How did you get so brave?
Who made you so brave? 
When I was saying no, when I was against this wedding,
you were unhappy. Why? Why were you unhappy if you had someone else in your heart?
I was quiet because I was worried for your future. 
Had you told me then, I would have said no. What do you think?
Am I happy for this wedding? No. I'm not happy dear.
But I cannot do anything. I cannot.
Its all your fault. You liked someone else and said yes. So now you'll have to get married.
I'll die mom..
You should die.
Mom.. Mom..
You're here and I'm looking for you in the whole house.
I had a headache so I came here for some peace.
If you're unwell, should I take you to the doctor.
No. Its alright.
Actually, Faizi's wedding has created a lot of chaos and dad has brought aunt and her family. We don't get a moment of peace now.
You're right. Our privacy has been disturbed. Earlier I could talk to Safdar but now I have to careful. What if she hears,
or if she dislikes something.
I don't understand when will they leave?
I think they'll be here all our life now. 
Now get ready. Lets go to the salon. I've booked an appointment for you and myself.
For what?
I think you've forgotten, its Faizan's wedding.
No please. I'm not well today.
Can we go some other time? On the wedding day please.
Come on lets go.
Please mom. Call them at home today. We'll have services at home.
Alright, I'll call them to come home.
Enough Razi. 
Dear, what have you done to yourself?
 How long will you stay like this? Safdar has asked for you about fifty times.
This isn't a good thing. There are thousands of things to do. He needs you and here you are, suffering.
Come on get up and fix yourself. Eat breakfast and go to work.
Do you think this is all a drama?
No dear. I don't think that.
Then why are you taking my feelings for granted?
Its not that but I object to your condition. Why are you suffering like a lost lover? You'll make others suspicious.
See dear, life is beautiful. Will you sacrifice it for a disloyal girl?
Mom, she isn't disloyal.
Alright, she might not be but you cannot destroy your life for someone like this.
Come dear, I've ironed your clothes. Go to office.
Why did she do this mom?
What did I lack that she said yes for Faizan and not me.
No dear. You don't lack anything but when girls see a lot of opportunities, they do what Hadia did.
But its not her fault as well. Faizan's proposal was very attractive.
What do you mean?
Whatever Hadia decided was right.
No dear. I am not saying that but she'll regret one day.
Its just you should have a bigger heart and accept that she's marrying someone else and you have no connection to her.
No mom.
The fire inside me. I'm burning inside.
Leave me alone mom.
Alright. Do whatever you want to do.
You hid this from me.
Mom we found out ourselves last night.
Safdar uncle brought him along every time and we thought he was his son. 
Hadia was happy because Safdar uncle brought the proposal.
Even you people didn't mention that boy and we thought he was Safdar uncle's son.
So Hadia likes Razi?
Its good that our girls liked the boy who came in our house. Is that how we brought you up?
No mom. please don't say this
You know how many eligible students dad have. Hadia was never interested in anyone. Razi was different.
He expressed his love to Hadia and she was impressed by his honesty. 
She was happy because Safdar uncle brought a proposal.
But mom, trust me, Razi is a very nice boy.
I agree Razi is a very good boy.
But he shouldn't have just expressed his love. He should have sent his mom. 
He declared his love and sat at home. This is not how gentlemen are.
Mom this is where everything went home. Razi didn't mention to his family and Safdar uncle brought a proposal for his son.
At least you could have told me.
What should I do now? The arrow has left the bow. 
Ask Hadia to focus on the boy she's getting married to.
It doesn't suit respectable girls to keep their old flames in the heart.
But mom..
Can nothing be done now?
What will I do now Fizza? She is getting married in front of a hundred people tomorrow.
What should we say no for? Do we have a basis? 
And listen to me. I'm warning you against doing anything wrong.
Our house has no space for all this.
Mom, I will always tell you if I like someone.
