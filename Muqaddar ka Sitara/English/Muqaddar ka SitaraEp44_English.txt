What is it?
Where are you?
I was in the market, taking care of something. I just got free.
I'm going back, what is the matter?
Can you please pick me up from the salon?
Alright, where are you?
I'm in phase 5, I was waiting for the driver, but he's with Hadia.
Alright fine. Send me the location and I'll be right there.
Okay, perfect. I'm dropping you the location.
Okay bye*
Where are you going? We'll drop you off.
What nonsense!?
Have you no shame in harassing a girl like that?
We're not harassing you, we're just praising your beauty.
Just shut up and get lost.
Don't get angry, we're on our way and we'll drop you off.
Who are they?
Are you insane? Who asked you to wait outside? You could have waited inside.
Razi, I thought you were almost about to reach, that's why I came outside. Why did you...
talk to them. You know how dangerous they can be, they are carrying guns sometimes. What if something had happened to you?
Really, what if something would have happened to you?
Since when have you been so worried about me?
It's not about worry, it's about responsibility.
I have to take care of you and you're no less than Farwa to me.
Shall I say something?
What?
Don't you have some appropriate clothes?
Now, what's wrong with my clothes?
Let it go... I was just saying...
No, tell me the type of clothes I should wear.
I think...
you'll look good in shalwar kameez.
Alright fine, you'll only find me in shalwar kameez from now on.
Look, forget about what I said. It's your life...
I'm not forcing you, only wear it if you want to...
No, I like your suggestion.
Turn the car around and let's go to the mall.
Right now?
Yes.
Don't you want to go home?
I did want to go home, but now I want to go shopping with you.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
I need to go somewhere far because of mother and I'm already late.
I will hear no excuses today. We're going to the mall today.
We'll shop, have ice cream and then we'll go home.
Natasha, please.
Razi, please! Turn the car around and let's go.
Okay.
Yay shopping!
Ramsha...
All good? Why did you call me so urgently here?
Why haven't you come home in two days?
Ramsha, I just...
Enough... no more excuses. You don't pick up any of my calls...
You use meetings as an excuse to turn off my calls. What game are you playing with me?
No game.
Some problems are going on at work. I'm really busy at work and I need to win my father's trust. I need your support.
Faizan, I was scared. Will someone compel you to leave me?
Ramsha...
No, I will never leave you.
Soon, I will tell everyone about our relationship.
When will that time come?
Soon... just let me be financially independent.
But that will never happen until Hadia is still present with you. Why don't you leave her when you don't like her?
Why don't you remove her from your life?
It's not that easy, and now it has become even more difficult because...
Because what?
Nothing...
Because she is pregnant?
How do you know?
You didn't tell me, but I learned it on my own.
And if you want to know how? Then look at this video.
I saw Hadia outside the clinic today.
And I understood that she was pregnant.
And who is that man, who took Hadia for a check-up?
I didn't know that you guys are so liberal that another man would take Hadia for a check-up.
He's my cousin, Razi.
How come your cousin is so informal with your wife? So much so that he's holding her hand and roaming around with her.
There is nothing like that in that video.
There wasn't...
But that's the truth. I saw it.
This is no concern to you.
Don't be angry with me and ask Hadia why she was with Razi.
You act like a lion in front of me...
Ramsha enough...
Not a word, please!
Otherwise, what will you do? Will you leave me?
Faizan, once and for all, why don't you leave me? I don't like spending such a life as well.
I've grown tired of this. You told me that you had no interest in Hadia and that you will leave her.
But now she's pregnant, now it's harder for you to leave her.
Very convenient. How much longer should I tolerate this?
What is going on? Why are you two fighting like kids?
Mother, Hadia is pregnant and he didn't tell me that. He's taking care of his pregnant wife...
and he's lying to me that he's at work.
You were right about him. He's a liar, a fraud, and a coward.
He left no stone unturned in trying to ruin my life.
It's better that I die rather than live this life. I don't want to remain unwanted in someone's life.
Ramsha, listen to me... Ramsha... Ramsha!
What happened Ramsha! Get up Ramsha!
Ramsha*
Ramsha, call them...
Note this.
Doctor, what happened to my daughter? Why did she faint?
No need to worry, this happens in her state. I have good news, your daughter is about to become a mother.
What? Thank you very much. Thank you, God!
Such great news! Did you hear? Many congratulations!
You're about to become a father and I a grandmother. Thank God!
Why are you standing there? Bring sweetmeats. I'll go check in on her.
Where did you go?
Hospital for a check-up.
With whom?
You don't take me, so obviously with the driver.
Don't lie to me.
I saw you and Razi coming out of the clinic together.
That doesn't mean I went with him. I saw him outside when I came out of the clinic.
Go and ask the driver if you don't believe me.
Enough Hadia!
I don't need to ask anyone anything. I saw you two.
I'm warning you one last time. Stay away from him!
Stay away!
I'll ask the driver to pick it up. Faizan...
Where are you going?
To my friend.
So late at night?
Faizan, there are greater things in life than your friends.
One has to be practical to move forward in life.
Relationships are more important than friends, do you understand that?
Relationships? Since when have you started talking like that? Did you make a deal with father?
Faizan, don't talk nonsense.
You know that your father has strictly asked me to keep an eye on you.
And you're giving him a chance to do such things.
So, will you spy on me now?
Faizan...
I'm tired of my father's strictness and his dictatorship.
How can he restrict me from going to places and meeting people? I can't spend my life according to him.
Your father only wants you to give Hadia time...
I've grown tired of hearing her name, so enough!
I don't want to make anyone happy. Not Hadia, or father. It's my life, can't I spend it my way?
You look very nice...
Really? I don't look weird, right?
Not at all.
The dress is so beautiful. Do you choose it, or was it, auntie?
This one is mine.
Come and sit... mother was telling me that you weren't feeling well. What happened? All okay?
Yes, my blood pressure rose, that's it.
That's good.
I wanted to apologize to you... I wasn't with you in your hard time...
If Faizan hadn't had an accident, I would have been here.
Forget about it Hadia.
I don't want to remember the time. It's good that I got rid of a liar like Sherry,
I'm very happy now.
That's good. Because all of us want to see you happy.
Hadia, I wanted to apologize to you for everything that has happened.
Mother and I didn't like you before, but now I want you to forget the past.
So that we can become friends. Is that possible?
Why not?
Safdar... you haven't changed yet, don't you have to go to work?
I'll go at my leisure.
You've never been late to work, why the sudden change?
When children handle their responsibilities, then parents can find the time to relax.
Thank God. That means that you're happy with Faizan.
Maybe... and this way you'll find some time for me as well.
My time has always been for you.
No way. You've always given more time to your business.
I know... you've done everything for us.
I want my children to become my support in my old age.
And I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully.
If God is willing.
I was very satisfied seeing Faizan at work today.
I hope everything happens as I'm planning it to. Where is he? Send him to me.
Of course. He left as soon as he had breakfast. He told me that he had to learn some things at work.
The manager was praising him. He said that Faizan was very involved in work.
My son had always been brilliant, but you always compared him with Razi. Now see, everyone else is praising him as well.
One shouldn't be so content so soon. I don't want this to be a flash in the pan...
Please, Safdar, don't say such things about Faizan...
Not only him, but you also demotivate me as well.
Alright, I won't do that...
Alright... I told you something, but you didn't respond.
About what?
About Fizza.
Because of Hadia, Fizza's studies might get disturbed. Studying medicine is very hard.
You're saying that like she's the only one studying medicine.
Alright... ask Hadia... if she agrees...
then call her.
Why would she object? It would give her time to spend time with her sister.
Do what you think is right. I'll go freshen up and then I have to leave for work.
Alright, in the meantime I'll have breakfast served.
Faizan have something sweet. I've made mutton pulao as well for you, be sure to eat it before you leave.
Forget it mother, he won't eat it.
The news of my pregnancy has struck him like lightning. He has lost his appetite.
It's nothing like that.
If that were true, then your voice wouldn't be so hesitant.
And you wouldn't have left me at the hospital yesterday.
I needed to go home, why don't you understand that?
I understand everything.
You're not happy with my pregnancy, rather you're sad.
No Ramsha, it's not like that.
Your face tells me of your heart.
But if you think that I will get myself rid of this child, then you are mistaken.
What's the matter with you? Why are you being angry for no reason? I admit I'm tense about it, but that doesn't mean I'm not happy about this.
That's the complaint I have against you. If you had any confidence you would have taken me home.
You would have accepted me as your wife in front of everyone. You would not have continued to meet me in hiding.
Anyways, whatever fate chooses for me.
The sad thing is that I love a cowardly man...
Listen to one thing with open ears, I will not compromise when it comes to my child.
I will not let anything unjust happen to it. The time has come for you to make a decision.
Otherwise, I would not let you see my face or my child's face. Understand?
Don't worry Faizan. Ramsha is very angry, that's why she said such things. I'll make her understand, everything will get better.
How can I not worry? Have you seen her attitude? How can I not be tense? I haven't told them about my marriage, then how can I tell them about a child?
Faizan, Ramsha loves you.
She has sacrificed a lot for you. She bet her entire life on you.
I just have a request...
Be mindful of her emotions. Don't be unjust to her.
Do you understand what I'm saying, right?
Hadia...
Yes?
What are you doing?
I'm setting my wardrobe.
Why? The doctors have asked you not to do such things. Why are you doing this, when you have servants at home who can do this for you?
I do ask them to do things for me, but what's wrong with doing something on my own? I get bored at home.
That's not okay. I've arranged something for that. I've asked Safdar to bring your sister Fizza here.
There is no need for that, she just went away. This will affect her studies.
Fizza being here will distract you. She will take care of her diet. Besides this way, there will be someone here you will listen to.
I've called her here. She'll be here any moment.
You just went there last week. Why are you going now?
Her in-laws told me that she isn't taking care of herself, so I'll do that.
Besides, I have to stay there for a few days, after that my parents will come. Then I'll go on a long holiday.
You complete the notes, right?
Yes, I have.
We're getting late for our classes.
Go ahead, I'll be right there. Farewell*
You have no respect, you didn't even thank me.
For what?
What do you mean? I helped you get out of that rush.
Thank you...
I haven't completed what I said.
Everyone is watching, let go of my hand.
Alright, I apologize.
But, you weren't listening to me, that's why I held your hand.
I've warned you before...
Stay away from me! I'm warning you one last time, if you come near me again, I'll complain about you to the principal.
But I need to talk to you. Until I complete what I say, I will not go anywhere.
Do whatever you want. Scream if you want, but I will not go until I say what's in my heart.
I love you Fizza... and if I don't have you...
then I will die. I will really die.
I really love you.
Are you mad?
Do you even care about your self-respect? If I tell the principal about this, he will expel you.
Your career will be ruined, do you even care about that?
What have I done that he will expel me?
I only expressed my love, what's wrong with that?
You're insane, don't ever come near me again.
Just say yes... I'll send my parents to you and take you away respectfully.
I'm warning you one last time, otherwise, I'll shout and gather everyone. Then you'll be humiliated.
Don't come near me.
You're back soon.
Yes, mother...
There wasn't much to do at work, so I decided that I should spend time with my mother.
That's very good. Otherwise, I don't see your face all day.
I only see at night.
What can I do? I have to take care of things at work.
All of that is right... but I have a complaint. You don't think about yourself.
You're there for that. How can I think for myself when you're here? 
Really... what will you do, when I'm not here. Will you think alone?
Mother...
God forbid something happens to you. I can't live without you.
Then why don't you stop being stubborn?
Forget about it. Freshen up, then we'll talk.
Alright... I don't see Farwa. Where is she?
She's making something for you in the kitchen.
Really... that's great. I'll go freshen up.
Alright.
Wow... that smells good. What are you making?
Pasta.
Brother Razi likes it...
Really? What else does he like?
I was just asking.
Where's auntie? I haven't seen her in a while.
And... why are you doing this? Let the house help do this.
Yes, there is... but I like staying busy.
Why? Have you stopped studying?
No, why would I do that? It's my final year, so I have a lot of free time.
I use that time to make brother Razi's favorite dishes.
I feel like cooking nowadays...
I was thinking of learning it from you and Hadia. Would you mind that?
Why not? That's great.
Let's start today. What have you added to the pasta?
I've just boiled the pasta. Let me tell you the name of the spices first.
Hand me the chilly...
This one?
You've gone very weak.
It's good that aunt Shina called me here. I will take care of you.
I do take care of myself.
I can see that.
Now that I'm here, I will take good care of you.
Auntie didn't do right by calling you here.
Because of me, your studies will be disturbed. I know how tough your studies are and still, you had to come here for me.
Sister, why are you worrying? I will cover my course.
You know how intelligent I am.
Sure... I know that. Shall I have lunch served for you?
No... I just had lunch.
Go and rest. We'll have tea in the evening.
Sure... where's brother, Faizan?
He's at work.
Is he finally enjoying work?
Go and lay down. You must be tired.
After you guys left, he came to me and said all sorts of nonsense.
He's gone insane. I don't know what to do.
I was thinking of complaining to the principal. I forgot my notes there as well.
That won't do you any good. That will only defame you
Your name will be joined with that man in the university. And he will go to any lengths to take revenge on you.
Listen to me... take a few days off from work for a few days and stay away from him.
He'll forget about you when he doesn't see you.
But that's not a solution.
He knows his sister's address as well. He followed me here when Nisar dropped me off last time.
I fear that he might say something to Nisar.
Why don't you tell Nisar about this?
I think it's time for you to tell Nisar about that man.
You're right, I should do that.
I will do that...
I'll talk to you later. Farewell.
Forget this... and choose a girl from this...
Look how pretty they are, choose one.
Should I look at a picture and choose them?
When did I say that? This is only a start.
You can meet them later on. Who's stopping you?
If you say yes now, only then I can move things forward.
But I don't want to marry right now.
Enough Razi! When will you marry Razi? What are you waiting for?
Listen to me. I want to leave this place!
Hurry up and marry. So that we may leave this place.
I want to marry Farwa and you. Look at me...
If you like some girl then tell me.
You know there's no one.
Yes, I know that, that's why I'm looking at girls for you.
Listen to me... if you choose someone, it will make it easier for me.
I want to marry you before Farwa.
Mother... don't worry about me. Think about Farwa first.
No... first you will marry, then it will be Farwa.
Natasha my dear...
Auntie...
I brought pasta...
Did you make it?
No Farwa made it... but she asked me to bring it for Razi.
That's why I brought it here.
Yes, he does like pasta a lot.
I'll get going...
Sit down...
No auntie. I was doing something.
Here, eat this pasta.
Leave it be and get up.
Come on...
I'm not hungry. I'll eat it later.
My God... my words do not affect him.
Why are you always listening to something? Try listening to me for a change.
Ramsha, you need to compel him to take you home with him.
After all, you're his wife. He needs to accept you in front of everyone.
I did say that in front of you...
If Hadia leave his life, then my life would be settled.
What I don't understand is now that her affair with his cousin is exposed to him...
then why doesn't he leave her?
It's not that easy. Hadia has Safdar Kamal's support.
If I had that support, then I would have been in a strong position as well.
But Faizi's father will never favor me.
Yes, but if Hadia leaves Faizi, then that's something else entirely.
She will.
If Hadia's parents...
learn about you...
