My child, take care of yourself
We'll leave now
Mother, don't go. I just came
God knows when will we meet then?
And you people hadn't have dinner yet
my child ..
Permit us to leave today
We'll have dinner some other day
Look, we have to go to Fizza's hostel as well 
we have to meet her too and then ..
we have to reach home before midnight
later ..
Fine, I'll wait for you both
listen?
Take good care of yourself, eh?
understood? Shall we go?
Okay my child
lets go!
Bye!
Sheena, your attitude today
with sister and brother
was really inappropriate
taunting has become your habit
and today?
you have crossed all the limits
such bad manners?
such attitude
they didn't stop even after hearing the good news
you should have stopped them at least for dinner
I did
You wanted me to fold my hands in front of them?
O God!
Brother Aleem is my very old and close friend
and now this friendship has converted into a relationship
whenever he comes here
he should get a protocol. I'm telling you
They should also stay in their limit
Ask them to stay in contact only with their daughter
They better don't interfere in our personal matters
They were just asking about Natasha ..
Enough of supporting them
I know such people very well
when they get a chance
to find our weakness
they start taunting
they aren't such people
why do you always think negative about them?
your opinion about ..
Hadia wasn't right as well
but see
how much lucky is she proven for our house
Becoming a mother isn't a big deal?
Many women in the world are going through this phase
as if she has done a big thing
Sheena
I'm not just talking about that
You see how much Faizan has changed after wedding
he's acting mature
he's focusing on his studies as well
and is also taking interest in business
People do get sense of responsibility and become mature after wedding
if you ..
want to give credit to Hadia for this all
then fine, I don't care
Enough of this Sheena
Fix your mood
Hadia ..
is daughter in law of this house
she's our daughter
and it is your responsibility to take care of her health, food and everything
Look, you ask a maid to always take care of her
Also, I forgot one thing
Send baskets of sweets to brother Aleem's house as well
what is the need to send it now?
When the time would come
when Faizan would have a child
then I will distribute sweet among the whole family with my own hands
not just family, distribute it in the whole city. I have no objection
but for now, do what I'm asking you
Ask Raazi for some baskets of sweet
and ask him to give it to brother Aleem's house
Aren't you happy of becoming a mother?
why would you?
If Raazi was at my place
you might be happy then?
what do you want?
why do you insult me again and again?
Be thankful that I'm silent
I haven't told anything to anyone. The day they'll find it out, you have no idea what chaos will it cause?
he chaos has already happened
what is left more?
you doubted on me
and have shown how small your heart is
Hadia, I'm only silent because of this child
otherwise?
whatever has happened?
Hadia, if someone else was there he would have done God knows what
but why are you quiet?
if you doubt me this much then leave me
go and tell everyone
am I mad?
I'll leave you so that you can go to Raazi?
this is what he wants
enough!
enough of this Faizan
I have heard you enough
now you'd listen to me
mother, can I say something?
yes?
I don't feel that sister Hadia 
is very happy
what do you mean?
I mean ..
I feel that something happened between sister Hadia and brother Faizan in Islamabad
why do you think this way?
I don't feel any such thing
Faizan is very happy with her
She gave him such a big news
yes, brother Faizan was happy but sister Hadia looked very dull
she might be tired because of travel
She'll be fine after rest. Didn't you see how happy she was after meeting her parents?
yes
It might be a misconception
but I felt so
otherwise, I have never seen sister Hadia this sad ever
leave this 
you go and check food in kitchen
Raazi is about to come
Tell me, why didn't brother Raazi come back with them?
I don't know. I'll ask when he'd be here
The relation I and Raazi had
it was in past
that was only limited to phone
I started liking Raazi considering him Faizan
I didn't know that you were Faizan
It was a misunderstanding
When uncle Safdar came to our house for the first time
Fizza told me that he's Faizan
his son
On first sight ..
he liked me
We didn't even meet after that
We only talked on phone
When Raazi confessed his liking to me
Next day, uncle Safdar came with the proposal
The Faizan he brought the proposal for ..
was actually Raazi
I came to know about this during henna night that he is someone else and you are uncle Safdar's son Faizan
Shall I call father and tell him your love story?
Shall I tell him how his dear nephew meet his daughter in law and my wife secretly?
You had always taken my place but now I will humiliate you in front of father so much that he won't see your face
Is this why you were very formal with me?
There was someone else in your heart and mind
only in the beginning
that was also because you didn't love me
you weren't giving me attention
you were insulting me again and again
you didn't like my existence
I tried hard to get closer to you 
but there was someone else in your heart
you kept cheating on me because of that Ramsha and now you are blaming me for betrayal?
I am a man. I can do anything
Don't compare yourself with me
wow!
how is this fair?
Because you are a man, all your sins are forgiven?
because I'm a woman, no one should even believe my innocence?
you aren't that innocent, Hadia
you got married to me but loved someone else
it wasn't love
it was a misunderstanding
I only loved one person and that is you
I can swear upon our unborn child
I took Raazi out of my heart after our wedding
and trust me ..
besides living in the same house
Raazi never tried to come closer to me or talk to me. That day, suddenly ..
Enough!
Enough!
do you think that I would believe your false explanations?
enough!
don't lie further
I will keep a firm eye on you both
what you do or say or where you go ..
it will be according to me
your life is under my control
and if I have heard anything wrong
I will tell everything to father
Yes mother?
Where are you Raazi?
You aren't here. Its too late
You are back from Islamabad
Yes mother, I have
I was out for some work
I'll be late 
don't you worry
why won't I be?
your uncle has asked many times
why aren't you picking up his call?
answer me
hello?
hello?
huh?
he disconnected the call
this guy ..
Faizan my child, are you going somewhere?
yes!
Did Hadia have her dinner?
I don't know
My child, take good care of her
she is becoming mother of your child
I know
do you want to say something else or shall I go?
umm
I was just ..
try to explain it to you
did you not like it?
auntie, give these advice to your dear son
not me
my parents are alive to advice me
and I think I'm mature enough. I don't need advice
so please, be careful next time
what if I misbehave. Then you'd complaint to your dear brother
and environment of house will be ruined
what happened to you Faizan
why would I complain?
Auntie, you and your son can do anything
I know this
Did you have a fight with Raazi?
did he say something?
mother?
He's ill-mannered. He'd always be
how many times have I told you not to talk to them
why do you talk to him?
he ..
did he have a fight with Raazi?
what happened?
nothing!
He is habitual of blaming brother
leave it
lets go
people with similar thinking
are not in our fate
I wish
I wish I had sent proposal to you before Faizan
then today ..
you were mine instead of Faizan
I have lost a diamond like you
Stop! Where are you going in rush?
Are you taking it for Faizan?
yes!
what happened to him?
I don't know. He isn't telling anything
He looks sad and lost
shall I ask him?
No, you don't go
he's very angry right now
angry?
what if Hadia has found out about you both?
I don't know. May be ..
but I will find it out
He will stay here tonight
its good
Go and take care of him
its a good chance
okay? Go!
Faizan, what has happened to you?
At least, tell me?
you are very upset
I can't see you like this
how many times will you ask?
nothing happened
I will keep asking until you tell me the truth
you are really upset
And I care about you a lot. I can't see you like this
and may be I can help you
Ramsha, I'm telling you. Nothing happened
leave me
you?
you are calling at this time? Is everything okay?
umm
its midnight
Faizan hasn't come back
I know where would he be right now
don't you worry
you mean?
with Ramsha?
yes
he won't go anywhere else than her
anyways, don't you worry
I will find out
no! you ..
you don't call
I don't know why I called you
he will come back
God knows what will happen if Faizan has a doubt that I called you
you don't need to be worried
you didn't do anything
look
you don't need to be scared of anyone
I here
okay?
Bye!
If I wasn't in love with Hadia
then I wasn't worried
I would have let her go
now she isn't only my wife
she'd be a mother soon
its impossible to leave her
I can't tolerate it
What if Hadia is telling the truth
She might have a relationship with Raazi in past
whatever it is
you?
what are you doing here?
umm
umm
Farwa ..
I was finding Farwa ..
where is she?
Farwa's room
is there
this is my room
oh
umm
I'm sorry
Faizan?
Hello?
Hello Faizan?
Where are you?
You left me early in the morning
you didn't tell me why were you so upset?
but I got it
you had a fight with your wife?
she might have found out
that I also came to farmhouse with Zohain the other day
hello?
Faizan?
Why aren't you answering?
are you listening to me?
hello Faizan?
hello?
Raazi?
Greetings mother
Greetings! Live long my son
what happened?
Did you come late last night?
I and Farwa slept waiting for you
tell me this, why did you go straight to office after coming back from Islamabad?
why didn't you come back home?
mother ..
I had to attend an important meeting
this is why I couldn't come directly home
okay!
listen?
did you have a fight with Faizan?
no!
what happened? Did something happen?
see
I was telling you this
that if something had happened
then brother Raazi had told you the truth before anyone
but ..
his mood wasn't fine
he was upset
mother ..
he is always like this
anyways ..
leave him
I don't care
but he should change his habit now
he's going to be a father
brother, shall I serve you breakfast?
no!
I am going for walk. I'm not hungry
Come mother!
Be quiet!
Get lost!
I won't let Sherry get on my nerves
Raazi?
you are awake this early? Is everything alright?
yes ..
I woke up
are you going outside?
umm .. I
just asked
Is everything okay, Natasha?
umm .. yes
Even if it isn't
I want it to be alright
these days
I have weird dreams
I can't sleep properly
anyways, everything will be fine
don't you worry
I'm going for walk
you can ..
join if you want to
umm
are you sure?
yeah!
okay then
wait
I'll go and change
wait for me
I'm waiting outside
what happened mother?
mother?
yes?
what happened?
no, nothing
I am worried
I just saw Natasha with Raazi
its okay. They might have left for some work
but I'm scared
and I find it weird too
what if Natasha ..
has started taking interest in Raazi?
Natasha has changed
I have been noticing too
I mean
she has started talking nicely
her behavior has changed a lot
she talks really nicely especially with brother Raazi
Raazi too ..
no mother, brother Raazi 
you know brother Raazi
he ..
he won't take interest in girl like Natasha
also ..
Brother Raazi refused earlier for the proposal
yes, but Natasha refused too
She rejected my son earlier
and now see
she is after him
this is good ..
what does she think of my son?
first, reject him
then ..
come after him
mother, its a matter of time
situation has changed now
Natasha might have realized her mistake now
this is why she's changing. 
and taking interest in brother Raazi
no!
I won't let it happen
I would never accept Natasha as my daughter in law
I accepted her earlier because of my brother
but now ..
there is no question
I ..
want a daughter in law like Hadia
pious
and obedient
Leave it. Don't take tension. Have tea. It will be cold
I'll give it to you
have it
