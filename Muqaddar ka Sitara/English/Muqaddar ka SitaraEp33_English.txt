Hey Faizan, why aren't you picking up phone?
Greetings uncle Saleem
how are you?
Hey, Faizan wasn't ..
picking up my call
do you know where is he?
With Hadia? To farm house? Where?
Hello? Did you find out where he is?
Yes I did. I talked to uncle Saleem
He told me that he's with Hadia
and has gone to farm house
what?
Faizan!
Greetings sir!
Greetings!
Come in sir!
Sir, you get fresh. I'll organize the table
Okay!
Wow! How beautiful is this place
how beautiful is everything
really amazing
yes, its beautiful
There is something over there too. There is a mini zoo
There is also go karting
A person gets tired, but farm house doesn't end
father has made such good arrangements for us
how much he care about us
If I knew coming here would make you so happy
I would have already arranged it
No problem! I'm going to enjoy a lot even now
lets go change
I'm hungry. Lets have lunch
what is it?
you seem very angry
Yes, I'm too angry
I feel like burning the whole world
what happened?
what did Faizan do now?
I know this well
that only Faizan is the reason of your anger
it isn't difficult for me to get it
now tell me, what did he do?
My doubt was right
Faizan hasn't gone to Islamabad on business trip
infact, he has gone to Muree with that Hadia
so?
what's to worry about it?
how can he do this to me, mother?
its been only 2 days that we are married
my dear ..
you chose this difficult path yourself
I used to always tell you ..
that Faizan isn't strong
neither he is sensible nor loyal
and he has no sense at all
mother, what rubbish are you saying?
my concern isn't this right now that either Faizan is a fool or sensible
so?
then why are you crying?
Faizan will keep doing this
now he's riding two boats
and do remember one thing
he will leave some one of you
and ..
I think it would be you
Hadia's father in law would save her
he is also my father in law
how could he leave me?
when he'd come to know that I'm his son's wife
hey! hey!
how innocent you are
take this misconception out of your mind
we can use these threats only on Faizan
if by mistake
Safdar Kamal would know about it ..
then we'd have to suffer
He will send us somewhere over the night
and no police would be able to find us
no one would know where we are
then?
then mother, you tell me? What do I do?
I can't tolerate it at all
that Faizan is with that Hadia
and I'm alone here
you'd have to tolerate
Cool down
or else it would back fire
wow!
so much?
sir ordered us
what is the menu of dinner?
your reservation in hotel is already done
Fine! You can go
if you need anything, do let me know
he is controlling us here as well
what happened Faizan
he would want to surprise us
I am really liking everything
you shouldn't think negative too
who is calling?
father!
give it to me, I'll talk
he would be asking, how is everything
no, I'm doing it
greetings father
who is with you?
in front of whom it is difficult to talk to me
Everything is really good, father
are you in some meeting?
yes!
then talk normally without taking my name
no one will ask
also, a wife can call anytime
yes, but we are having lunch right now
I'll talk to you later
Hadia is very happy
thank you so much!
Okay! bye!
hello?
hello?
Hey, father is calling me now
there is no need to talk
what happened? he won't like it
I'll talk
He won't. I have just talked. Why is he calling again? 
we are on honeymoon. He should leave us alone
I'm putting your phone on airplane mode
so that no one disturb us
I'll put mine too
I'm very hungry. Can I please have food now?
her phone is switched off
whose?
Natasha's
I ..
I'm scared, what if she'd leave the country
she can't go anywhere. I have her passport
what if she goes to U.S embassay and complain about you?
don't you worry. I'll look after this
She's doing everything because of that clever person
otherwise, I know that she isn't that sensible
you check this
she made such a big mistake
she won't do this all if she had sense
she wants me to give her property worth millions so that her husband would take it and run away?
huh
and then she comes back to us? She won't go out
he would go
and as far as ..
complaint is concerned
she can complaint anywhere
I don't care
you still care about your millions?
you don't think at all in what condition your daughter is?
I haven't contacted her since 2 days
for you, your ego might be valuable but for me 
there is nothing more important than my children
if I have to give away this whole wealth
to get my daughter back? I will definitely go for it
if you won't support me
then fine
I will still fight. But I won't leave my daughter alone in this pain
Hadia, are you ready?
2 minutes
be quick
you look very beautiful
infact ..
you are
very beautiful
you always do look
shall we go?
I don't feel like going
such a bad person is calling right now
I just ..
who is that bad person?
father asked for some work
that person is calling. I have to cordinate something
you go sit in the car, I'm coming
Okay! Come soon
hmm
here!
how many times have I told you not to call me here. I'm here for work
I'll call when I'd be free
what if I have made a mistake?
but I had no option but this
I do .. I do love Ramsha
and Hadia ..
I don't want to betray her
how innocent is she
and how much she loves me
she'd be too hurt if she'd find out that I'm betraying her
and Ramsha would kill me if I'd ignore her. I don't know what will she do if she'd find out that I'm with Hadia
she also loves me a lot
I wish
father hadn't forced me. Then I wasn't stuck between two girls like this
you don't think at all in what condition your daughter is?
I couldn't contact her since past 2 days
for you, your ego might be valuable but for me there is nothing more important than my children
You?
won't you ask me to come in?
did father send you?
I want to talk something important
come in
lets go and talk
I don't want to talk to anyone
come in my child
Khadija?
Khadija?
Greetings mother!
Greetings!
my daughter is here. Its good that you are here
House was empty without you
yes!
I got leaves for few days so I thought to go to my parents quickly
this is why I came rushing here
you did good, my child
since the day, Faizan and Hadia are gone to Muree
your mother
is missing them both a lot
now that you are here
she'd be happy too
sister is very lucky
sometimes, she is in Islamabad. Sometimes, Muree. Sometimes, somewhere else
they are beautiful places
I really wish to go. I have never gone
no problem
when you'll get married
then go with your husband
no, I don't want to get married
hey, can you hear her?
one has to get married
also ..
I'm just worried about you
why do you worry, Khadija?
we are done with the responsibility of our elder daughter
we'll fulfill the younger one's too soon. God will help us
come on, wash your face
put your luggage inside. I'll make breakfast for you
yes mother!
go!
I had been trying your number since long
why wasn't it responding?
my phone was stolen
at home ..
why didn't you try to contact anyone at home?
do you know how much auntie is worried for you?
look
whatever happened has happened
I'm here to take you. Come! Uncle is too worried about you. Come
who are you to order me?
who am I?
think that I sympathize to you
I'm trying to take you out of this trap
come with me
Natasha? Natasha?
I do agree that you got married
you took the right decision
but the guy you got married to is wrong
he isn't right. You don't deserve him
and this is why uncle is worried about you
how ever Sherry is, he is my husband
I know it well how good or bad he is
father can be worried about me
but why are you here?
and you talking against my husband
Natasha ..
I won't just speak
I will prove it to you as well
you don't deserve that guy
he's greedy
do you know why he got married to you?
because he knows that you are daughter of Safdar Kamal
he doesn't love you
he loves your status
come with me
who is he?
he's Raazi. My cousin
the one I was getting married to
what is he here for?
I'm here to take her
she's my wife
she might be
but you don't deserve this
do you know
she might not know about you but I know you
you are a greedy person and a hypocrite
you got married to her only for money
shut up!
or else I'll break your teeth
what do you think?
you'd scream at me and I'd be quiet?
remember this, Sherry
I will come back
I will take Natasha with me. Remember that
Go away! I saw many like you
I am not scare of your threats
and you ..
if I'd see your cousin here next time
I'd break his legs
what happened?
you are upset because I insulted that cousin of yours?
Raazi?
what was the need of going there?
are you in your senses?
I can't tolerate uncle's sadness
he looks fine but he is too worried about Natasha
huh
when they'll raise their children like this ..
then they'd have to face this day
mother?
this isn't uncle's fault
its his fault
father doesn't have this responsibility only
that he fulfills his children wishes
and put all other responsibilities on mother
and mother ..
that too like Sheena
couldn't Safdar see?
these children aren't spoiled just now
they are spoiled since childhood
mother, why are you talking about past? Someone would hear it
it wasn't your responsibility
it was Faizan's responsibility. He should have gone
Are you saying this?
mother you used to say this that I'm like his son
and you have not raised me this way that I won't help my uncle who is like my father when he is worried
seriously?
Natasha ..
has always insulted you
how ever she is
I don't care
mother?
being a dignified man ..
I would never want my uncle's children worried
and I won't help them?
mother?
Natasha?
for how long will you be upset?
can you make me a cup of tea?
I'm having headache
look I know that you are worried
didn't you see
what was he saying about me?
he was blaming me wrongly
if he wasn't your cousin
he had no idea what I could do to him
Sherry, you have taken revenge of your insult
there is no need to do anything
you ..
look
in front of him
you were calling me your husband again and again ..
and now when I held his collar, it is making you upset?
thankfully he wasn't angry
he would have beaten you up if was angry too
I'm enough to talk to him, so please
Okay!
I'm really sorry
look
I have right on you
I can't tolerate anyone to look at you
Just now you were saying that you got angry because he blamed you?
I was angry at that too
but you tell me?
if someone would blame a decent man so wrongly, won't he get upset?
but ..
why was he blaming you? There would be something
Natasha, you are getting manipulated by him for no reason
he wanted to take you along. He needed a reason for that
Natasha, I'm warning you
if your cousin would come here again
I will report a case against him
that he kidnapped my wife
but next time if you'd raise your hand on him or do anything
then I'd go with him myself
are you getting it, Sherry?
he did one right thing
mother, brother Raazi shouldn't have gone there
what if something would have happened to him?
I was worried about it too
what if something would have happened to my son?
I would have died
we are well aware of auntie's and Natasha's nature
they don't see anyone's sacrifice
also ..
we have no relation with Natasha now
still brother took risk for her
my child ..
he is doing this all because of his uncle
he doesn't want Safdar to face any trouble
also ...
somewhere ..
he sympathizes with Natasha too
You know it very well what feelings do Natasha have in her heart for us. How much she hates us
especially with brother
yes my child ..
no matter what she thinks about us
but I haven't raised you this way
that you'd see someone in worry
and leave him alone
right now, Safdar ..
need us
we should help him
He's worried about Natasha
no matter ..
he doesn't say anything by mouth
but he is suffering inside
hmm
fine!
we'll do what you'd say
but I'm worried about brother Raazi
I have seen him broken once
because of sister Hadia
it was hard for him to take control of himself
but now 
if something happens, I won't be able to tolerate
May God have mercy
so
tell me this first, how is your trip going?
haven't you forgotten us?
its amazing
its such a beautiful and big farm house
I'm enjoying a lot. Weather is too good too
I don't feel like coming back
wow! That's great
Tell me, how's brother Faizan
isn't he in bad mood?
is he scolding you again?
o no! He's really nice. He takes such good care of me
I'm enjoying here because of him
otherwise no matter how good a farm house is
if Faizan wasn't treating me well
then I wasn't enjoying
Wow! Wonderful
now don't talk much
we'll go for dinner tonight
I'll send you pictures. Do show those to mother
Sure! Do take care of yourself. Bye!
bye! Take care
hey?
where are you going?
grocery is finished at home
I'm going to store
where will you get money?
I don't have it now
leave it. I have credit card
oh
okay
at least they left something
I thought thief took that too
by the way
you should fulfill all my needs
but then I think ..
its useless to keep a hope, right?
look Natasha?
I do what I can
this doesn't mean that you make fun of my love and emotions
love?
my foot
hello?
yeah?
she's gone now
o mother
I really missed this breakfast of yours. 
their taste is same today
it isn't changed
take dessert too
mother, do you know?
I have a university friend
I also shared this breakfast with her
and she's a fan too
she really wanted to come along
you should have brought her
I would mother
but she didn't get leaves
she said she'd come next time
then she'll have it
sure
Hadia also likes this breakfast
we would have enjoyed if she was here too
you keep saying Hadia all the time
I'm your daughter too
I met you after long. Give me some importance
don't be upset
you know it Fizza
I love you both equally
I know it mother
I was kidding
I will beat you. I thought you are upset in real
why would I be upset?
I know it
you and father both love us a lot
and the sacrifices you have made for us
we value that a lot
and will always do
you have grown up
now eat
dessert is amazing too
