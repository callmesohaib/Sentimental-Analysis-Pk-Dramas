Greetings Mother!
Greetings darling! How are you?
I'm doing all good. What about you?
Yup! I'm fine too.
Tell me that did Nisar come to pick you up?
No mother! actually I'm still attending my last class. He'll come after this class ends.
Have you informed him?
Yes mother, I did.
Fine!
Darling! Stay conscious and careful!
You understand, Right?
Mother! Don't you worry at all. I know it.
Good! I expected this from you.
Listen! You're father said that if you ever need anything, do tell. He'll send you the money for it.
No mother! I have cash on me already. I saved some from last month. I'll surely ask if I need some.
Sure! Take good care of yourself.
Listen! There is a fight between boys outside. Come on, leave this place quick!
Fizza, don't worry. Come with me.
Where are you talking me? You should not worry, I'm all good.
Why should I not worry.
Can't you see? They are fighting.
Please let me help you.
I don't need your help. I'll manage it myself.
Fizza! Please.
Don't act like a fool in such situation.
Everybody else might need you. Go and help them out! Leave me alone.
Hello!
Hello! hello Fizza.
Where are you Fizza?
I'm all good! Where are you?
You should send me your location. I'll come and pick you.
No! No! You should not come inside the institute! There is a fight going on.
You should wait at the gate. I'll come there myself! It's a fuss here.
No! You wait there. I'll come and pick you myself.
No! It's a rush of people inside. You should understand that it'll be difficult for you to find me.
I'm coming to the gate myself!
Fine! But be careful. I'm also arriving on the gate in a bit.
Sure! I'm coming. OK, goodbye.
I thought that we'll have a nice conversation, but after seeing you in such condition. I forgot everything.
I'm still here for the next 2 months. I hope you won't deny meeting me again.
Sure! But It'll be difficult for us to meet in university. You can meet me later at my home.
That'll be great! I would love to see your home.
It'll be great meeting uncle and aunt too.
Should I drop you to your hostel now?
No! I won't go to my hostel. You can drop me at my sisters home. Safdar uncle is there too.
That's good. You'll also get proper care there too. You need it.
And ask Hadia to care for you. She'll surely!
This is why I think you should ....
Just drop me as we are getting late already. Let's get going.
Sure!
Take care. I hope we'll meet soon!
Sure!
I'm really sorry! I wasted a lot of your time.
No! Don't say that. It's nothing like that. I myself wanted to meet you and spend some time with you.
And believe me! I enjoyed it.
I just felt a little bad after seeing you in such condition.
Don't you worry! I'll be fine soon. Take care.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Ma'am!
What?
The younger sister of Hadia ma'am is here.
Who? Fizza?
She is injured and in a bad condition!
It's always a new drama, every other day.
Hadia ma'am told me to inform you and Safdar sir!
Why! What's with us.
Go! Wait a second.
Go and tell Safdar sir about this! I'll go and see them.
Sure ma'am.
I should go and see what's with this Fizza now.
Sit here comfortably. No one is going to disturb you.
Sister! You are worried like I got in a deadly accident. It's just a minor scuff, and I am all good.
Don't say such foolish stuff. Have you told father about this?
No! I didn't tell father about this. You should also not. He'll get worried for nothing.
OK! Now go ahead and drink some milk.
Sister, I'm healthy and fit. It's just a minor injury. I was just a little scared at that time, that is why I quickly came to you.
And I was just a bit upset because there was no family member with me at that time.
And Nisar also wanted to drop me at your doorstep after seeing me in such condition.
Oh! So you came here because of Nisar?
No Sister! I also wanted to visit you myself!
Sure! I understand it already.
Now quickly finish your milk.
You always force me sister. I'm all good! It's just a minor pain, it'll be fine in a bit.
Milk will help you with your pain!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Where are you coming from in such a condition?
Actually, in university...  Greetings uncle!
Greetings! Why are you injured Fizza? What happened in the university?
Nothing uncle. It's just that some boys started to fight in groups, inside the university. I got entangled between them.
It's good that you came here directly. This is also your house. Who would've looked after you in the hostel. Hadia is here for you.
You should be here to take care of your sister as you know her condition, but whatever.
No aunt! don't you worry at all. I won't disturb my sister at all.
I just came here for a bit. I'll leave soon.
You did a fine job of thinking to come here directly.
I would have sent a driver for you, If you had called. How did you reach ?
Nisar dropped me.
Is Nisar back?
Yes father! I was thinking of inviting him, uncle and aunt on a dinner.
Sure! Why not? We'll also invite your parent's too.
Just look at there condition right now. You still want to have a dinner in the house this urgent?
They are both doing fine! They'll both enjoy when they meet their parents and relatives too. Now you should rest Fizza!
You can stay here as long as you want to. It's just like your second home. Hadia is also feeling happy, as you've came to stay with her.
Uncle I cannot stay! It won't look good.
What are you talking about? Treat it as your own home. If you stay, It'll make us feel good too.
And it'll be better if you skip your university for some days.
It'll be better for you as we don't know what is gonna happen in next few days.
Father won't allow me.
Who'll inform your father?
I'll talk to him myself. But don't let her leave this place for a week at all Hadia! Take good care of her.
No one can speak in front of our father!
Aleem is always acting so nice and caring, like he is the only one with nobility.
But when his own daughter is roaming around in the whole city with her fiancée, where is his nobility?
Or it's just because he doesn't know about anything.
What are you talking about?
There was a fight in her university! She would've been scared.
If he came to pick her up, It's nothing bad. I felt good after listening to this.
I think this is all in Aleem's notice already.
Sure! You've become so broadminded.
You have never allowed your daughter to ever meet or roam around with her male friends.
It's because there is a difference between friends and fiancée.
The boy is only here for two months. If Fizza interacts with him during this period, It's not a big deal at all.
He is so innocent. I know his father really well! You know him as well. He is the son of Abdul Rehman !
Whatever! I didn't like such an action of her. And why did you let her stay?
Is there a need of your relatives in this house?
She is the sister of Hadia! She can come and visit this house at anytime. We should not stop her from meeting her sister at all.
And you know that Hadia is already depressed!
It's so good that she came. They'll both get better and enjoy with each other.
And if Hadia tells something to her sister. Then what?
She won't! I have told her about this, and she understands.
I can still trust Hadia.
But her younger sister is too sharp. She can understand anything according to the situation.
For god's sake Sheena! Don't go that deep.
You should be happy that we are finally going to be grandparents. We all should be happy, but you've started to discuss some foolish stuff.
And why did you allow to invite them all on a dinner? It's between Aleem and Rehman directly. Why should we arrange a dinner for them?
Seriously? You know that they both are my mutual friends. It's my love for them that I invited them together. Now stop with these foolish questions.
Greetings Safdar! How are you?
Greetings Aleem! I'm doing fine. What about you, and how is your wife?
Good! Great! Everything is fine and my wife is also good.
It's just that she is lonely and always thinking about Hadia, and now Fizza has left for her studies in Karachi too. You know she stays worried for both.
Tell her to not worry about them at all! Hadia is safe and healthy, and Fizza is also here to meet Hadia. I just met them both together. No need to worry at all.
Fizza is at your place? When? Why? She didn't inform me.
Aleem! Don't worry, as she is fine. Actually two groups started to fight in her university! She just felt a little disturbed. That's why she came to her sister.
She didn't inform me at all after going through all of this? I'll come and pick her from your place, tomorrow! Thank you for informing.
No! You don't need to come. She is at her own house. It's the same as Hadia is like my daughter, Fizza is too! As her university gets back to normal.
I'll go myself and drop her to university! You should not worry about anything at all.
As you wish! But I'll inform Khadija. If she gets this news afterwards, She'll get stressed.
Then I'll see, If she wants to come. We'll inform.
Sure! Take care. Goodbye!
Goodbye!
I should go and inform Khadija !
Now this was left! What's wrong with Father? We have no privacy left at all.
Your father bought this big house for his relatives to visit and stay!
I no longer feel like this is my own home.
I feel like staying at some other place.
What has happened to you both? Relax! She is here only for a week, not her whole life.
Listen! Try to ignore her. Don't converse with her that much.
Do you really think that I'm that free. I won't.
That's a fact! You never have time for your wife. Why would you manage some for her sister?
What about that affair of yours! The one, Raazi informed us about. Is it true?
Go ask Raazi yourself! Why are you asking me.
Seriously?
Mother! If Raazi has informed such a problem to us about Faizan. Why are we not taking it seriously.
That Raazi is a huge hypocrite. Don't you ever take his name again, in front of me.
What have done as a father of Hadia? How can you let Fizza stay there?
It's just for a week.
And she just went to her own sister's home! The situation in her university is bad, so it's not good for her to stay in hostel yet.
I am satisfied of Hadia also living in Karachi.
She could have came back to us. Lived with us for a while. I didn't force her to stay in her hostel in such situation.
Why don't you understand Khadija? It's not just her sister's home. It's also her uncle's home.
It's also her aunt's home! You know Sheena very well.
Hadia is their daughter in law! Handling everything is her duty.
But Fizza! Why should she cope up with their problems?
I've already talked.
This is your problem. You always talk without coordination.
Try to think before taking any such action.
I think my opinion is a disgrace to you, Right?
Khadija darling! Why are you always so negative?
Why shouldn't I be?
You never deny to anything Safdar asks for! I know it surely that if he invites us to stay at his place, right now.
It'll take you only some seconds to pack everything and move.
Khadija!
Hey! Where are you going so fast?
I'm going to join Fizza in the lawn.
Fizza is here right? She is not running anywhere.
You should be careful!
You don't care about yourself at all! But what will we say to your parents?
That this is how we are taking your care?
And your sister will surely tell everything about us, when she gets back to her home.
I'll be careful from now on!
And you only care about your close ones!
You don't care about us at all!
Have you ever thought of Natasha? The trauma she went through?
Have you even talked or asked her about her health?
I actually..
I don't need your foolish explanation.
Remember this! My kids should never be stressed because of you.
You should start taking responsibility! Stay responsible to Faizan specially. As I can see you are non serious towards him.
And also ask your sister to stay in one place. She should not start roaming around the whole place.
She wasn't that injured, that we have to deal with her for the whole week.
So bad! Why don't you complain about him.
I'm thinking of complaining about him.
But he just got his admission in this university. You know they'll expel him! It was so difficult for him already to get admitted in medical department.
Mother and father have sent me here. I cannot break there trust in me.
You are right but whats the other solution for this problem?
I don't know sister. I'll let God handle with this. I am thinking of discussing about this with Nisar!
He is so caring, sharp and broadminded! He might be helpful.
You are so lucky that your partner is just like you.
That's true!
It's a fact madam! Keep yourself safe from evil eye. I really love your relationship.
I'm just waiting for you both to get married. I'll enjoy so much.
Don't mind. I've come here but I don't enjoy you and Faizan staying so distanced from each other. I didn't see such a thing in your photos of Murree.
He is always busy with his official work. He comes to the house at night when he is tired. That's why I let him rest.
What's with he staying so busy always sister?
Safdar uncle is way more busy than him, but still gives proper attention and time to his family. Is Faizan more busy than him?
Why are you thinking like that?
He is really caring towards me! He even reminds me of my medicines if I forget to take them.
May that be the truth!
I still worry about you after I remember the behavior of Faizan in the beginning.
May god be with you.
Now at least eat these apples I've cut.
No! You should eat. I don't want to.
I'll get late! fine. OK! OK!
Raazi!
Can you drop me?
Where? To your friends again?
No! Father gave me a number of psychologist. I thought I should go meet.
I have booked an appointment already.
Psychologist? Why?
Actually! I've been feeling lonely and depressed from so many days. I thought it'll be better for me to give psychologist a visit.
To feel better, you don't need to visit a psychologist! You can visit your friends and enjoy with them.
You are right but I don't feel like joining my old friends!
I also don't want that to happen.
You should forget the old ones.
Make some new friends!
Will you be my friend?
Were we enemies?
Sure! We were never enemies, but our relation was not that great ever.
We were cousins the whole time, but never felt like we were. I know it's not your fault.
Totally mine! I was the one who always misbehaved. So sorry. I understand.
It's OK!
You are still annoying!
Aren't you getting late? Hurry! Get in the driving seat.
If you don't mind me telling you this, but don't visit a psychologist.
Because you are not my friend yet?
What's the other way of becoming friends.
It's OK! Will you consider your friend's one statement?
I'll affirm with all of your statements!
Listen Natasha! Right now, It won't be good for you to go outside.
Do you understand?
No!
Girls don't leave there house when they are in iddat!
It's just been some days since you took divorce.
And in such situation, you should not interact with any male at all, except your father and your brother. You should not even interact with me.
I'll take you on a dinner when your iddat completes!
Fine?
Sure!
Natasha ma'am! Your mother is calling you.
Go and tell her that I'm coming!
Here! Look what I got for you.
Mother! I already own so many clothes. I didn't need more yet.
Natasha! Don't you remember your craze for shopping? It was like a hobby to you.
Mother! I don't need such things anymore.
This is all happening specifically because of that Sherry!
You've changed so much! I feel hurt when I see you like this.
Your mentality, your way of thinking and your taste in things. Everything has changed.
Mother! I need to forget my past. Why would you take his name in front of me, again and again.
So that you become like before.
That is why your dad booked you an appointment with the best psychiatrist, which you wasted.
Mother! I don't need any psychiatrist to help me out with myself. I have already figured out the thing that'll keep me happy.
Mother! please forget my past, and think about my future.
Faizan hasn't arrived yet? What happened with you?
Why are you crying? Hey! did you guys fight?
No! nothing like that happened.
Then why are you crying? and why is he not home yet?
I think something went in my eye.
You know that Faizan comes late!
Yes! I can see that.
He is just with some of his friends.
Tell me one thing! You are hiding something from me, right? There is something that is hurting you.
Tell me about it.
There is nothing like that. I think its too late, so you should go and sleep now.
Sister! I know you are hiding something. Tell me what happened.
I can see that you guys were so close and loving towards each other before. After coming back from Islamabad, you treat each other like a stranger.
Don't think like that.
There can be some little problems between husband and wife, so that doesn't mean..
Sister!
Please tell me what happened, and why don't you go and talk about Faizan's behavior with Safdar uncle specifically.
Quite!
Enough sister! You have already been through a lot.
Go and talk to Safdar uncle and inform him about Faizan's behavior towards you.
Fizza! Stay quite. You wouldn't discuss this at all with anyone. Neither with father, nor with mother!
I don't want to stress my parents at all. Understood!
What is wrong Safdar! You look worried.
Nothing!
It's been so much time since I got married to you. You think I cannot judge your mood by you facial expressions? Tell me what's wrong?
Sheena I think there is someone in the office, who is trying to mess around with our accounts.
What? Who can it be?
I don't know yet, but soon I will.
It might be Raazi!
Please Sheena!
Sheena listen! Raazi is not just my nephew, but also a wise and honest man.
I can trust him with closed eyes! I have already allowed him to my accounts with millions in it. He has never done anything foolish.
Whatever! Punish that man with the worse after you find out.
Even if it's someone close.
Why do you always target Raazi?
That is because I'm not blindfolded like you.
I can judge Raazi very well, so I can clearly tell you that this is him!
This is your problem! Raazi is just like my right hand. I trust him.
Fine! As I already said that I'll reach that person quickly after some investigation.
What was the amount?
Millions!
What is your problem? Why are you calling again and again?
When will you come?
Why do you care? does it matter to you?
Why doesn't it? I'm your wife!
Really?
I thought you forgot me as a husband.
Enough Faizan!
Do you know Hadia? I'm at a point of no return right now!
It won't help me with any of your explanations or apologies.
Faizan! You are the one who cheated.
Shut up Hadia!
Why? The truth is bitter?
Sure! I know I'm unfaithful.
But you also spend some time with Raazi, when I'm not there?
Faizan! for god sake, stop with this foolish talk.
Why? You felt bad?
I also feel bad when you call me unfaithful or cheater.
You get me scolded by my own father. Now he has even started a proper check on me and my actions.
Hadia! If you want everything just like before. You want me to care for you! You have help me clean my character in front of father.
And say that Raazi is a liar.
I cannot blame him for your doings!
Then just forget me!
Faizan! Don't let this topic spread.
Come home! I'll forgive you and try forgetting everything you did.
You know my condition. I am taking stress continuously. It's really bad for our child health.
Hadia! Don't blackmail me because of my child.
You know very well that I forgave you just because of this child.
Faizan!
What are you talking about? How can this happen? Who is he?
It's Raazi!
He is the one who saw me and Faizan together! and also told Faizan's father about us.
Wow! You have told me such an amazing thing.
I'm so happy! But I still cannot believe that Hadia being so humble and innocent, can do this too.
But I'm really happy.
There's also a bad news!
And when you hear it! Your excitement will vanish.
What's that?
Hadia is pregnant!
What?
