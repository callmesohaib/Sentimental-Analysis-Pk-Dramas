You came home late last night as well.
So?
You're asking me, but I'm compelled to answer you.
You give Ramsha all your answers.
I don't want to argue.
I'm not arguing.
This is the grave reality of my life.
And if you don't talk to me about this today, then it will be very late.
Before everyone at home finds out, you'll have to explain your relationship to me with Ramsha.
The way she followed you to Islamabad and you meeting her, saying that it was a business meeting. What was all that?
I know who is putting this nonsense in your head.
Whoever it is... they have always wanted to the best for us.
Aren't you defending him quite a lot.
Enough.
If you say anything uncivil again, it won't be good.
What do you think about what you've been doing? Father should know about what you're doing.
Alright. Go and tell father about Ramsha. But let me tell you this, I won't stay silent.
I will tell him about Razi. So let it be...
Don't come in front of me.
When you do, your betrayal comes in front of me as well.
We've both made mistakes, then why should I be the only one who is punished?
You should be punished as well. What about your punishment? What about your mistakes?
You want to tell father... go ahead.
But you'll have to face the consequences as well, remember that.
Sure alright, I'm leaving for the airport. Whatsapp me the details of the meeting.
When will you be back?
As soon as the meeting is over. It will take a few days
Take me as well. I would have had an outing as well
What will you do over there?
Hadia is about to become a mother. Being her mother-in-law, you have some responsibility.
A mother-in-law is a second mother.
Keep me away from this responsibility. There are servants to take care of her.
I knew you would say that.
That's why I've asked sister to take care of her. Farewell.
Faizan...
Where are you going so angrily?
Office.
Why the office?
You should go to university.
You've taken so many days off, you should go to the university today.
I've left the university. I'll give the papers privately.
What do you mean you left university? Why?
I'll go to the office from now on.
To keep an eye on Razi.
He's not just deceiving father, he's deceiving everyone. I'll make sure he's ousted not only from the office, but from this house as well.
Alright fine, don't worry. 
I'll find everything about Ramsha and tell you.
I'll tell everything to uncle and make him aware of the truth.
No, you won't say anything to anyone. Especially to father...
Otherwise...
Otherwise, what?
Hadia, what are you afraid of?
You don't know how angry Faizan is... if her expose his affair with Ramsha, then he would defame us.
I can tolerate anything, but not a stain on my reputation.
In this society, nothing is said to the man..
But a woman's life is made hell.
And I don't want to give my parents pain in their old age. Fizza is on her way to getting married...
And I...
I'm about to become a mother.
I can't take such a high risk.
You will say nothing to no one. This is what's the better for the two of us.
Understand?
Mr. Faizan, how are you? Mr. Safdar has left for Islamabad, but you must know that.
Where's Razi?
He's in his room.
You?
Did you find the time to come to work?
This is my father's office.
Whether I come or not, no one can ask me anything. Especially you.
What are you prideful of?
Thank God that I'm not opening my mouth.
About your affair with Ramsha, and how you used university as an excuse to steal money and have a good time with her.
Think about it. What if I tell everyone about that?
What if I tell you that you were having an affair with my wife.
Shut up!
If you say something so vile again...
then I won't be able to restrain myself.
Who are you?
Don't restrain yourself. Tell my father that I'm having affairs.
If you think your threats will silence me, then you are wrong.
No.
Don't think this is a threat.
If you think you've become a hero bringing Natasha home, I can end that in a moment.
It's your misunderstanding that my father likes and trusts you more than me. I am his son!
I'm his son. And who are you?
You are a salaried employee. Your family is feeding of our scraps!
Don't talk about my family!
Don't go there.
If I respect your mother and sister, then you should respect my mother and sister as well!
Don't forget that she's not only my mother..
she's you aunt as well.
I'm warning you for the last time.
Stay away from my business.
Otherwise I will embarrass you so much in front of father that you can't even fathom it.
Do whatever you want Faizan...
I will not be bothered by you threats. I will do what I think is right.
The basis on which you're so confident, if I open up my mouth, think what will happen to her.
Think long and hard before doing anything.
Be very mindful of it.
Leave.
This month you only gave me five lacs.
Sir, I wasn't able to manage this much, this month. It's hard for me to do anything by hiding it from Mr. Safdar.
Sir, he's been checking everything diligently nowadays. If he finds out I can lose my job.
You're acting like a victim. You said yes to this because you could do it. It's not like father started checking up on things just now.
I need ten lacs every month and you will get your commission as well.
Go.
Sure sir.
You're sitting outside here?
What is the matter Natasha?
You've seemed lost nowadays. You're sitting here alone and smiling.
What is the matter? What are you thinking about?
Nothing mother. Look how good the weather is.
Natasha, I'm your mother and I know you very well.
You're thinking about...
someone else. 
Are you insane?
Look, don't do anything foolish. I will not tolerate a stupid decision like that.
If Safdar finds out, he will oust me, alongside you.
Mother, don't worry. Nothing will happen.
Who is he, by the way?
Razi...
Are you insane Natasha?
You're back my dear.
What is the matter? Why are you in a bad mood?
I'm asking you something. Why are you angry? Why aren't you saying anything?
I think we should leave this place.
Did you have a fight with Faizan?
No.
I had no fights.
Will I not find out...
if you lie?
Mother, tell me one thing. If someone were to tell you...
put false allegations on me, in the future, will you believe it?
Not at all.
Because I know my son very well.
Meaning you trust me.
Yes... I trust my son.
Thank you.
Wash up and change...
I'll serve dinner until then.
Okay.
Something happened.
I don't know what he's hiding from me.
You rejected him, or did you forget?
I remember.
If you remember then don't forget that I won't accept Razi, or his mother.
Mother...
auntie is not like how she once was, her status is changed.
She'll lose her status, if Razi loses his job.
Why would he lose his job? He has handled father's business splendidly.
That's the problem. If Razi wasn't involved with Safdar, I would have ousted them from this house, a long time ago.
Natasha, you've fallen head over heels for Razi ever since he saved you from Sherry.
For God' sake this is reality, this is life! This is not a film!
Don't forget that you were like this for Sherry as well.
But you cannot deny that he saved your daughter from that vile man.
What if he hadn't come there that day? What would have happened?
You're right, this is not a movie, this is a reality. This happened.
Look, no matter what, I will not accept Razi..
nor will I make Safdar's sister my sister-in-law, understand?
You said the same thing for Hadia's parents as well.
Mother, it's not important what I used to think about Razi...
what's important is what I think of him now.
And... what is the problem with this? Father likes Razi as well.
Natasha, seriously I think you've lost your mind.
You've just came back from living with Sherry.
And... this is what you're doing.
Don't forget that you were head over heels like this for Sherry as well.
These kids will drive me crazy.
Hello Hadir, how are you?
Thank God, you tell me.
I'm sorry I'm calling you after a long time.
It's alright. What is it?
I have something for you.
Sure, what is it?
If I had to remove any data from someone's phone, how should I do that.
It's so simple, first ask for their phone...
and then when they give it to you, delete the data you want to delete.
I'm serious.
Alright don't worry. You want to delete someone's data...
I have an idea.
We can have their phone hacked.
No, no hacking.
Give me some other idea.
Another idea...
Yes..
If you're not short on cash...
If they don't need their phone that much...
then let's steal their phone.
Faizan has no place in his heart for me.
What if he tells everyone?
What will happen then?
What will happen of that innocent soul?
No... that can't happen.
I'll have to stop Faizan at any cost.
But how? God please help me.
It was right of you to threaten her, but don't do anything more than that.
It's a matter of her respect.
I don't care.
It would be a disaster.
Just think about it.
Are these bikes following us?
You think so?
I don't have a mobile.
Show me your mobile!
Give it to me!
I don't have anything!
They took away my phone!
What the hell! They took my phone!
Listen... it had those videos, they took away my phone!
Calm down!
He had a gun! Is your phone more important or your life?
You don't understand. That phone had that video! Where are the keys!
Here is your possession.
Thank you.
You don't know what a huge favor you've done for me.
It's alright. A friend like you can have my life as well. But what I don't understand is...
why did you do this? What I mean to say is...
Why did you need Faizan's phone?
That is a secret.
I can't tell you right now. But I promise that I will tell you everything at the right time. Thank you.
It's alright. We'll meet soon.
Farewell*
Thank you...
Yes, greet auntie for me.
Greetings to you too.
Farewell.
Faizan..
Faizan, are you okay?
What happened to you?
Faizan, tell me, is everything alright?
Yes it is.
You don't seem fine to me...
I've made you favorite dish today. It will cheer you up
Do you really love me?
You doubt my love?
Faizan, if you think I married you because I was impressed by your status...
then look at me. I'm living in a small flat.
I'm Safdar Kamal's daughter-in-law and Faizan Kamal's wife...
but look at my state. Have I ever complained or demanded anything from you.
Have I asked you to buy me a mansion, like the one Hadia is living in?
No Faizan, I don't want anything from you.
Still you doubt my love?
Your father doesn't like me at all. What can't he do to remove me from you life.
Still, I took such a big risk.
Only for you Faizan...
Is this not proof of my love?
I am sorry...
I never understood your love.
But promise me one thing...
You will never betray me.
Please, promise...
I promise.
Faizan, did Hadia...
No... it's nothing like that.
Faizan, look me in the eyes.
You're hiding something for me.
I'm hiding nothing.
That is the truth.
Sit down, I'll bring lunch for you.
Sure.
How can I be so stupid? How can I be so stupid!
There is no back up of that video. I don't know what I will do now.
I'll have to do something, because I can't tolerate Razi anymore.
What happened? Did Faizan leave?
Yes mother.
He looked worried to me today.
He is worried, and the reason for that is Hadia.
Hadia? Why would he be worried because of Hadia? He was very happy with her.
He was in Murree and Islamabad because of her.
He was happy, but not now. I felt it.
He's started hating Haida, and that is good for me.
Because as far as he goes away from Hadia, the closer he'll get to me.
Hadia... Hadia... Hadia... hearing her name make my ears hurt.
What happened that turned Faizan's heart bad towards Hadia?
Don't worry. I will find out what Hadia did..
that made Faizan so upset at her.
Remember one thing...
don't back off your objective. Achieve your objective.
You understand me, right?
Make me a cup of tea.
Sure.
Greetings. Yes, I'm fine. How are you and father?
You don't sound fine to me...
Why are you saying that?
That day when me and your father visited you when you came back from Murree.
You didn't seem fine to me. You seem diminished to me.
I told you that I was unwell and we came from the hospital that day.
I know.
You told me, but I don't believe it.
You didn't seem happy, even though you were expecting.
You look diminished. My dear...
I'm your mother.
Tell me.
It's alright, believe, trust me.
Hadia...
Are you crying?
I got emotional seeing how happy you were.
Tell me...
How's Fizza, when is she coming to Karachi?
She's fine, she's in Karachi. She was asking about you.
Really... tell her to take a week off. I have lots to talk to her about.
She was saying that she'll visit you when you come back.
Hello? Hello?
Who were you talking to?
I was speaking to my mother. She was asking about my health.
I didn't ask what you were talking about. Do you know who explain themselves? People who are doing something wrong.
I am doing nothing wrong.
If you are so suspicious, here check it out.
Why would I check your phone? You could have saved Razi's number under your mother's name.
Who knows, you might have deleted it before I came here. He could be calling you from a different number.
You are a liar, that's why you're giving me your phone so confidently.
Hadia, change your old ways, at least do it now. Who know this baby...
Enough Faizan!
I will no hear one more word after this. Tell whomever you want. I fear no one.
Before alleging me, take a good look at yourself.
You are giving my love and right to Ramsha...
Is loyalty only imposed upon a wife?
Should a man not comply to it?
After marrying you, I didn't even think about anyone besides you.
And you have fallen so low that you are alleging me vile accusations!
Go and tell everyone. Then I'll tell everyone what you've been doing.
Go!
