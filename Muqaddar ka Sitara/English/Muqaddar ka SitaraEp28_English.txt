Natasha, your father said it only in anger
okay?
and you know his anger
it comes and goes like a wave
mother?
I won't let father do this injustice to me
how did he think to disown me?
he is short tempered?
I'm too. I'm his daughter
now you'll see
I will go to court and hire a good lawyer
and I will take my share
and mother, I don't want to live in this country anymore
I am a U.S. citizen and I want to go back to U.S.
Don't you dare do something that would make your father upset again
its better
to stay silent for few days
and then I'll convince your father and bring to you
you know that your father can't stay upset for long
Stop lying to me, mother please
you always say this and nothing happens later
fine, I made a mistake
but I don't deserve all of this
and which father does this to his daughter or children
I know it
but I'm helpless right now
Natasha, please try to understand
Trust me
He will forgive you in sometime, and bring you home
how many days are passed that I'm here
and father has disowned me?
you are still saying that things will be alright
enough Natasha
enough!
why aren't you trusting me?
I'm telling you
that I will convince your father
its better
that you stay quiet for few days
and don't worry about money. I'll keep sending
but don't you dare to think ..
to go to court
why do you want ..
us to be disappointed in front of the world?
and I'm sure, this disgusting suggestion of going to court
is given by Sherry
Natasha, I'll call back
you?
yes!
Natasha wants to go to court against me?
she wasn't to disappoint her father?
she would hire a lawyer against me?
she's just saying these things. She's emotional
you
you might not know
but I was thinking to forgive her today
but now I completely trust that my children
are selfish
and greedy
they just love
luxuries and wealth
not me
do one thing
keep it in your mind
from today
you won't stay in contact with Natasha, neither will you send any money in her account
I can't do this
and you can't be this cold. She's our daughter
neither would I leave talking to her
nor stop caring about her
okay!
if you really cared about her
then you would have raised her
the way sister raised both her daughters
enough
enough of praising them
I'm frustrated
I don't know what have those mother and daughters given you
cry
you will feel light
Please Sherry, I don't need your sympathies right now
take your anger out
You can take out on me
yes
because this happened because of you
what has my life become
I didn't deserve this
father isn't talking to me
where would I go?
I accept that I made a mistake
and I kept apologizing to you
what do I do now?
shall I cut my head and put in your feet?
do one thing, just leave
otherwise I'll leave
and will go to police station
to report an FIR against you
in case of betrayal
fine!
go!
do this too
what did you get by doing this to me?
father is too upset
I never thought he'd be this upset
why don't you stop thinking about your selfish family?
they don't care about you
not once they asked how are you and in what condition are you?
what's the use of this wealth?
that children can't use
I do agree that children make mistakes, but this doesn't mean that they disown their children
your father is selfish
where will he take this much wealth? In grave?
Just shut up!
I left my house because you brainwashed me
still you are saying this all?
Shame on you, Sherry
You should be ashamed
listen, I sympathize to you
don't consider me an enemy
I do agree that you don't love me
fine!
but don't hate this much
that I won't be able to tolerate it
this is true that I lied to you
I kept cheating to hide my status
but ..
I swear to my late mother, that I truly love you
and until I'm alive
I will keep telling you that
and do you want to know what can I do?
do you want to know?
you want to know ..
what are you doing Sherry?
leave me ..
Leave it, are you gone mad?
what do I say?
Thank you Faizan!
for what?
to spend such a good time with me. And that necklace ..
you shouldn't have spent money. I didn't need it
honestly, if I could
I would have got you all the jewelry
but ..
I don't have this much money right now
but I promise, very soon
I'll do what you'll ask
I have another surprise for you
ask?
what?
I'll take you to Hyderabad this weekend
really?
will you come along?
ofcourse, it my plan. I'll go along
do you have any objection?
not at all. I am too happy
You always complaint that I don't take you along
so I thought to do so
and you'd be happy too
Faizan, you have no idea how happy mother and father would be listening to me. I'll message mother and inform her
okay!
we'll do one thing
we'll leave on Friday
I'll drop you there
do let me know when you have to come back, then I'll send the driver
what is the need of staying there? I'll come back with you
you are going after long. You should stay
you never went to stay after wedding
your parents might thing that I don't permit you
they don't think that way
but if you are insisting too much, then I'll stay
wonderful!
Hadia, keep smiling
you don't look good when you are sad
no, I enjoyed a lot
I'll go to friend's place to get notes
I might get late
don't wait. Go to sleep
Fine!
Take care and come soon
what if I don't come?
what do you mean?
I'm kidding. 
Go! Take care
Take care! Bye
Bye!
Speak up?
I wanted to talk something important
I'm not doing anything
all I want to say
is to keep an eye on Faizan
its not good to trust blindly
look, someone who can betray his parents
how can he be loyal to you?
he isn't cheating
He had a girl in his life, who isn't there now
hmm
are you certain?
He swore upon in front of me
I do trust that
that husband and wife's relationship is based on trust
hmm!
I wish its true
I just want to see you happy
also ..
mother was telling me that an expensive necklace was stolen from your cupboard?
yes ..
some servant might ..
no!
no servant does it
what do you want to say?
say it openly
you might not like it but ..
Hadia, only Faizan could do this
no one else can do it
he can't do it at all
how dare you to say this?
I know Faizan more than you
I am familiar with his actions
and he hasn't done this before
he's a thief since childhood
he has already sold auntie's jewelry many times before
look
I won't listen to any other word
Hadia, I'm amazed
you have no doubt on Faizan?
So much has happened. Why didn't you tell anything to uncle?
why did you hide?
Such expensive thing is stolen from house. You should have told uncle
this is our personal matter
you don't need to get involved
you are right
but I ..
I'm saying it for your betterment
I have no other purpose
if you think that you would brainwash me against me by talking like this, then this won't happen
Faizan is changing
and I'm the reason
My patience has forced him to change
whom are you talking?
I was talking to Fizza
This Fizza ..
She has made you crazy
she talks to you for 24 hrs
God knows how and why she keeps brainwashing you against Faizan. 
she is the one who talks against Faizan
No, there is nothing like that
enough!
I can see and hear everything
as soon as she arrived Karachi
she has started flying
keep less contact with her
these girls
don't let their sisters live peacefully
where is Faizan?
I saw him ..
dropping you outside home and left
he went to his friend's place
is everything okay?
he took you out for the first time
he took me for dinner and shopping
oh!
shopping?
how did he get this change?
anyways ..
what shopping?
he got me 2 and 4 dresses. Nothing else
Faizy, you are leaving too early
its only 2 a.m.
I'm getting calls again and again
then make an excuse
tell her that you are with some friend
or your friend had an accident
she isn't a child
that she'll believe every time I'll make an excuse
If I won't reach in time
She will wake father up and then there will be drama
Faizy, I planned this party and did all the arrangements only for you
and you are leaving?
its not fair
and you do this always
you ditch me for her
because she cares about me
she gets worried
what happened? Why did Faizy leave?
he's a coward
he's a slave of his wife
no go behind him quickly
he can't drive
Faizan?
What did you do? You came drunk home again?
Don't argue
I'm sleepy
how did you come alone in this condition?
A friend dropped me
you made a promise
that you'd leave this all
you broke the promise
don't tell father
on one condition
you will leave these bad habits forever and won't do again
promise
I won't
I promise
I won't do it again
I won't
I won't do it again
I don't want to talk about Natasha
The way she has ruined my dignity
I can't forget it
Its fine that she has decided to go to court against me
I too
will answer her in court
look
forget Natasha's mistake for once
and think that she's your daughter
she's your own blood
Children make mistake
and parents have to forgive those mistakes
Safdar ..
for me
for once, forgive Natasha
after that
you won't get a chance to complaint
she will do what you would want. She will get married to whom you want
Please, for once ..
take this decision back
its too late now
I wanted her to get married to Raazi
but she had no interest in Raazi
if she had listened to me, everything would have been fine
and ..
our dignity wasn't ruined
its too late, please!
Yes mother, I and Faizan both are coming to you
I don't believe it
Faizan got ready to come with you?
Faizan has changed a lot, mother
he takes good care of me
I think, God has heard me
and faizan's attitude is changed 
listen?
I have talked to Fizza. I'm bringing her too. She has taken leaves
That's great
Both my daughters are coming back home
my house will be full again
I will wait eagerly for you both
Faizan is too happy too
He wants to meet you both
May God keep you both happy, always
Amen!
Okay ..
how's sister Sheena
and brother Safdar?
its been ages that we haven't talked
Aleem wanted to call yesterday
tell me?
What do I tell, mother
father is too worried
he ..
has decided to disown Natasha
why?
Khadija?
why aren't you having breakfast?
what is it?
since last few days I can see that you
look worried
yes!
I'm worried about Hadia
about her?
She is happy at her home
Hadia was telling
brother Safdar has disowned Natasha
disowned Natasha?
hey ..
what has she done that ..
Safdar took this extreme step?
she did love marriage
she hasn't done something wrong
I don't understand that he disowned her on this little issue?
it isn't a little thing
she ..
ran away from home
and did court marriage to a rowdy guy
and you know brother Safdar's anger
yes, I know Safdar
but still ..
being so strict with children
isn't good
I will talk to Safdar
not to brother Safdar
someone should talk to sister Sheena
she has spoiled her children
she didn't teach them manners
Hadia was telling
brother Safdar wanted her to get married to Raazi
but Natasha didn't like him
its her foolishness
She couldn't get a better guy than Raazi
leave it
shall I give you a good news?
sure?
Hadia called
she was saying that she and Faizan will come on lunch tomorrow
Mr. Faizan is also coming?
hmm
yes!
and ..
they'll bring Fizza along
then you have to make good lunch arrangements
after wedding, our son in law
is coming to our place for the first time
I have started preparations
do you know ..
after wedding, for the first time I felt that Hadia is too happy
Thanks to God
thanks to God!
now have breakfast
yes
Faizan?
Faizan?
Get up!
What is it Hadia? Let me sleep today
I don't have to go to university
you are forgetting
you made a promise to me yesterday
I remember
I have to listen to you
no, one more promise
what?
you have to take me to my parents today
Ofcourse, I remember
We will definitely go. We will go today
Then get ready quickly. Lets have breakfast. We also have to take permission from your parents
for what?
I don't take permission. We'll go and I'll inform
yes ..
father would be happy 
but I think ..
auntie would be upset
Let them be upset
its not your problem
and don't get scared. I'm with you
we ..
are individuals. Both of us ..
can take our decisions on our own
we'll do what we want to
yeah?
Give me 10 or 15 minutes. I'll go and change
what is it, son?
how are you awake this early?
He made a promise ..
He will wake up early and have breakfast with us
wow!
well done!
Can you see Sheena?
your son is on right track
tell me more?
how are you studies going?
they are going fine, father
I had an off so I thought to take Hadia to Hyderabad to her house
We'll leave in some time. I'll come back in evening and she'll stay for few days
I don't want to stay but he's insisting
then go my child if he's insisting
girls are very happy when they go to their parent's house
they are different girls, sister
as far as our daughter in law is concerned
she is very sensible
which house is hers ..
she knows it well
I ..
really like this thing about her
Shall I give you tea?
no!
My child, you are going to Hyderabad for the first time. Don't go empty hands
Raazi, my child ..
few sweets and fruits cartons
put them in car, my child
what's the need?
auntie is right, it isn't needed. Father won't like it
my child, these are the ways of decent families
do what I'm telling you, Raazi my child
umm
I think that ..
he doesn't know the route very well. Raazi my child, you go with him
This way, you'll go there too
and they'll reach there easily
yes!
umm
This isn't needed. We'll go with driver
and father will show Faizan the lands himself
Infact, I'll show him my school too
will you see my school?
as you wish
umm
I have pressed kurta and shalwar for you
you wear that
kurta and shalwar?
yes!
I?
no!
I can't wear that. Sorry!
Haven't you ever worn it?
No, I have never
I don't have it
you have it. Father gave you many Shalwar Kameez as wedding gifts
you never wore them
father would like it if you'll wear them today
Hadia, I won't be able to carry it
I'll look stupid
you'll look great
wear it for me for once
you'll look handsome
okay! If you say so
I will
I was thinking to wear that gold necklace that you gifted me
no, you leave it
you wear it on some event
on some wedding
or reception
change clothes
wear something nice. We are going to your place for the first time
fine, I'll change
in how much time are we leaving?
in some time
can you make juice before going?
okay!
thank you!
what is it?
you look so happy?
I think Faizan is taking good care of you
he's taking you to shopping
he's taking you to dinners, and now ..
he's taking you to Hyderabad too?
He took you to shopping
you didn't show me?
umm
I'll show you 
leave it
go and bring juice first
what is it?
that you are showing so much love for that girl?
you are buying her expensive gifts?
why are you acting like typical mother in laws?
she is my wife. Either I keep her happy or sad
its up to me whatever way I keep her
the girl yo didn't like till yesterday
today ..
you are getting her expensive things?
you are doing expensive dinners and going out?
also ..
how did you think about taking her to Hyderabad?
what is your problem?
that I took her for shopping?
or taking her to Hyderabad or treating her well?
what's your problem?
I know you very well
you won't do favor to your own father without something in return
what is it?
and this gold necklace?
why did you get her?
its not gold
its gold plated. I gave her only to make her happy
you can make a fool to Hadia
not me
there is nothing
wait
I'll show it to you. You'd be satisfied
are you satisfied?
why are you doing it?
why are you doubting me?
because I know you really well
I'm doing it because you asked so
you suggested me to get married to Hadia so that father would be happy
and I don't think he'd be happy only by getting married
I have to keep her happy
then only father would be happy
otherwise, he'd kick me out of house like he did to Natasha. I don't want that
I'm not an emotional fool like your daughter. I'd do everything with complete planning
not just like that
so let me do what I'm doing
please, don't interfere next time
thank you!
congrats
its beautiful
umm
I was about to show it to you
but Faizan ..
take care of this
situation isn't good
I'll go and change
hmm
