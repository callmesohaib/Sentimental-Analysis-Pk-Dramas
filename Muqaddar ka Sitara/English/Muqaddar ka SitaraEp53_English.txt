This is what brother said?
Yes darling! I've never seen my son so much stressed and guilty before!
Now the relation has changed!
Still Faizan feels jealous of Raazi?
Yes darling! Raazi wants to leave this country, just because of Faizan!
He wishes to leave them and get away!
He doesn't want to meet them!
Mother listen! If this is what brother wants.
Then let him leave.
But you are also here darling! How can I?
Mother! Hamza is here for me.
I'm really happy with him! You should not worry about me.
For now! You should think about Raazi!
It'll be a big problem if anything else happens later.
Sure! Faizan is just there to complain about everything!
He is always up to something negative.
Yes! I think Faizan is silent because he is already up to something.
Before anything goes south.
You guys should leave the house!
You guys should shift somewhere else in your own house.
I'll talk to Safdar.
If possible
We might leave this house before marriage.
Sure!
Whatever! Leave everything and tell me about your health. How are you?
I'm fine! Thank god. I'm totally fine. Don't you worry about me!
For whom did you buy this 1.2 million jewelery set ?
I've told you so many times to not interfere in my stuff. Don't you understand?
Answer me! Who do you gift these expensive things ?
You should just know that it was not for you.
I'm not bound to answer you for everything Hadia!
You are bound! I'm your wife! You should answer me.
I'll tell everyone now about the things you are up to. Including your father!
Hadia don't make me mad! You are not in the situation to argue with me.
Will you hurt me?
You are hurting yourself.
Every other day, you are sick! Sometimes your blood pressure is high, sometimes it's low.
Can you not live in peace?
Stay peaceful in this condition, and let me live in peace too.
When you know that there is someone and I gift her things, why are you questioning?
Do I ask you questions about Raazi?
May I work now?
Work!
What happened? Your kids didn't join us in the breakfast.
I don't know! Natasha slept late at night. Faizan is getting ready I guess!
Hadia! What's with you? Didn't you sleep? You look so tired.
Is everything OK?
Yes! I'm fine but I want to talk to you about something.
About what darling?
Faizan is involved with another girl.
He talks to her every night! He even meets her now. Every other day!
He even gifts her things worth millions!
Don't lie so much. Hadia!
What is wrong with you? How can Faizan afford such things? Safdar doesn't give him that much money.
Why will Hadia lie?
Father! I saw the receipt myself!
Really? Then show me the receipt!
Faizan has it!
Can't you see her? There's no receipt but still she'll lie!
Faizan doesn't have this much amount.
You know this well that your son knows the amount, and you know about it too.
Don't prove Hadia wrong! Call your son! Call him!
Hello!
What am I listening?
What?
You gifted someone an expensive gift?
Me?
Don't try to act strange Faizan!
Tell me the truth about the thing I asked! Hadia is true!
Who is she? Since when are you with her? Why did you gift her so expensive jewelery?
Why do you suspect me so much Hadia? You have insulted me in front of mother and father.
Talk to me! Don't ask her.
For whom did you buy that jewelery set ? Answer me!
I bought it for Hadia!
He is lying! He didn't give it to me.
I didn't give it because it's an anniversary gift!
It was supposed to be a surprise! but you...
Father! He agreed to me that he bought this set for that girl! He didn't want me to interfere in his matter and he told me that he'll not leave that girl.
Father!
Wait a min! Let me decide. If you really bought that set for her then bring it!
Father!
Hadia! Can't you see. Faizan has decided to hand you over the house, the car and bought this expensive gift for you. You still just want to humiliate him?
You know well that if this set was for someone else, then Faizan wouldn't have it still.
Hadia would've misunderstood! Please! Stop it.
You can keep it now! I don't want to spend anniversary with you now!
Hadia! Faizan is trying to change so help him with it.
Help him daughter.
Try to ignore his little mistakes! It'll be great for you both.
Don't feel sad. Just apologize to him when he comes back.
What is really the truth?
Has that girl returned to Faizan's life again?
No!
This cannot happen.
Did I play well?
First of all! Try to knock before entering my room!
Really?
I'm the son of owner! Future CEO and I can do anything at anytime I want to.
You might be the future CEO! But till then, I have the authority right now.
You cannot enter my room without my permission! Get out.
I'll break your ego Raazi like this!
Just like I broke Hadia's ego.
I can see everything!
She might be dumb but she isn't cheap! You stole your own wife's necklace!
Mind your language Raazi! Don't disrespect me.
What is happening?
Father! can't you see? He is trying to hurt me.
He was threatening me that he'll kick me out of the office! You are hurting me Raazi.
He is denying his mistake and trying to hide it.
Father! He even said that he'll make me look bad. What is his problem with me?
I'm telling you that he is lying! He was talking about Hadia!
Father you can see what happened before when she blamed me! I am totally innocent! They all are trying to insult me! he has became so ignorant.
Faizan!
I'm warning you the last time! Silence.
He is threatening me in front of you! You should think about what he does with me on your back.
Faizan!
Enough! don't even say a word.
If you think he has some suspicious activities, you should have told me directly.
Don't create a drama in this office so openly! We should appreciate him that he is trying to build himself now. He is changing from the old Faizan.
He is coming on time and learning more! You should appreciate him! You are disgracing him.
Raazi!
Now! You have to relations with him! Don't forget that.
You have disappointed me!
As I said! That I'm the son of companies owner. The future CEO!
So whenever you talk to me about anything. Think before talking. Be careful.
You can sit now! You are allowed to.
Sit down!
Hello!
Faizan! Where are you?
I'm in the office.
Saliq is calling you! Come quick.
Why?
You won't believe it!
I'll believe anything today! What happened?
Your factory got sold!
What?
I told you that you won't believe me.
Now you are a big guy! Celebrate a little and quickly come here.
Unbelievable! What was the deal?
Leave the deal and stuff about it right now! Saliq is calling you, so quickly reach the place.
You have to sign the papers.
Oh god! I cannot come right now! Father is here with me in the office.
You can make an excuse! You can tell him that you are going to visit a site. How can you miss such a happy moment Faizan?
You are right! Wait, and let me try. I'll tell you about it.
I have sent you the location! Quickly reach it!
What a day! What a day.
Congratulations!
To you too!
It would have been so great if you had bought this factory yourself and it would have later profited you and me.
Yeah you are right! I'm sorry you are selling this factory for so less but my business depends on cash. I would have bought this factory for 800 million!
The property would not have profited me that much.
If you still feel that you have accepted a deal in loss
You still have time.
You can still cancel the deal.
I have no objections.
No! Not at all! That's not what I meant. I'm comfortable with the deal.
That's great! You have to wait for your profit till next month.
It feels great working with you.
Same here!
Wow! Big guys are having big deals. Nobody is asking this poor guy at all. A lunch will be great.
We can arrange a party for later.
This is what I'm talking about ! party.
We can arrange a family party! You can bring your misses.
Of course!
Which one? Actually Faizan has two!
Now this only depends on Faizan! Either he'll come with both or just with one.
Yeah!
So what have you thought?
Who will you bring to the party? I mean which wife will you bring?
I don't know! Hadia doesn't like such things and you know the situation already.
If I take Rimsha! It's a big risk! I haven't told anyone about our marriage.
Well said! I think you should bring Hadia.
Keep Rimsha away from me after that farmhouse incident! As you know
As you know! These high class parties don't happen everyday. It'll be a big opportunity for you to interact with high class people. He invites the elite class.
But Hadia!
Leave it Faizan! It's only for your own good. ask why?
How?
Hadia is respectful and educated. If you bring her to the party, Saliq and guests will be very happy to see her.
There's respect for such girls in our society! You understand, Right?
I'll try.
Yeah!
I'm sure that she won't deny!
Raazi! I'm tired of these everyday talks.
You know that Faizan is trying to disgrace you! You should be careful!
After some days, we'll leave this house respectfully! Try to ignore him.
I've got myself into an annoying problem after getting engaged with Natasha. I don't want any more help from uncle.
Mother! You know well that I don't love Natasha!
She asks me to love her.
She is your future wife! She'll do it. If it was someone else. It would've been the same way.
It would be better if you can forget that first love of yours.
You don't want to forget her.
And you know well that she can't become yours anymore!
Who?
Who are you talking about?
No! Safdar! It's nothing like that.
I listened about it from my ears.
How can you let it go?
Raazi! If there's some other girl in your life! tell me about it now. So we can decide on this moment
Safdar! It's nothing like that! It's was an old affair of his in school days.
He didn't even tell her ever!
She has already got married somewhere else!
He'll forget her later! He just liked her so much.
He'll forget when he gets married to Natasha!
Sister! My daughter is not that cheap.
If he cannot decide! let's end the engagement now.
It's true that I don't love Natasha! It's also true that I am marrying her on your order.
You are my elder.
As you wish!
I promise you that after marriage I'll always keep Natasha happy just like a good husband does.
Fine Raazi! I can agree with your saying.
But I still want to give you a chance!
You can still step back because after this marriage, I won't like to break Natasha heart.
And the reason is that girl of yours! she might..
No Safdar! She cannot comeback in his life. She is married.
I have always agreed with your orders.
I have always been honest with you.
If you still suspect! You can get me married the next month.
Even my own house is ready!
A lot of people disagree with that.
Safdar I agree with it.
Sure! As you like!
Tell me the truth! What was that 1.2 million jewelery for? Who did you give it too?
I'm very tired right now! Can we talk about this later?
No! Faizan I'm serious about it! tell me the truth. Who did you buy the necklace for?
To a friend!
Such an expensive gift? Are you mad? Hadia scolded you right!
You better leave such acts! When you already have a wife.
Which wife? Is she even that capable to be called as a wife! What's the matter with having a girlfriend?
Still Faizan! You cannot gift her such expensive things.
If your father has filled your account with such a big amount, it doesn't mean that you can start spending it so foolishly. You know that he can take it back.
OK! I'll be careful.
What about the necklace you gave to your wife Hadia?
It's still yours! She won't keep it. She has a big ego. I'll return it.
Let's go!
Father! You are already here.
Yes darling! I came early! Are you going somewhere?
Yes! I actually ordered some clothes for my wedding!
The boutique just called and told me to pick my order.
That's good for you darling! Call your mother. I want to talk to her about something important.
Is it a surprise father?
Something like that. I want to talk about it in front of your mother.
Wow! They are also here now. Come Sheena, sit ! I have to talk about something important.
Important talk? About what?
About what father? Tell us.
Sure! It's about my daughter Natasha.
Tell us quickly Safdar!
Actually I have decided to get Natasha married next month now.
That's so urgent! Did your sister ask you?
No! Not at all.
Raazi talked to me directly!
I don't know why Raazi is in rush?
He's getting a factory. This is why he is in rush. He would want to get married tomorrow.
No my child, it isn't like this. I have already told you that he isn't a greedy person
He's a good person
Its an important call. I'm coming. Greetings! Yes, I was waiting for your call
Don't do it. I'm telling you that you'd regret. Also, Raazi doesn't suit you. Why are you doing this?
I know it very well what suits me or not
If I was wrong, father wouldn't have supported me. He likes Raazi more than me
father likes him because he doesn't know his reality.
He and you both would regret the day he'd find out
Faizan, Raazi isn't greedy at all otherwise he could take anything from father
I do agree that he isn't greedy but he is a fraud. He's a cheater
Hadia on one side, and you on the other. 
Just shut up Faizan. Aren't you ashamed of putting such a disgusting blame on your wife?
I'm saying what is true. Trust me, you'll regret and cry. Why don't you explain it to her?
I explained her many times. I did. She first chose Sherry and now Raazi
Sherry was my mistake, but do not compare Raazi with him. He isn't like him
He belongs to a middle class background after all
Father also used to live in a small town in Hyderabad. Why did you marry him then?
Mother, I'm telling you this last time. Ask Faizan that I won't hear any word against Raazi
He has gone blind in Raazi's hatred that he is blaming his simple wife
Fine! Listen, he is getting married to you only because I got married to Hadia. He is taking revenge. He doesn't love you. Explain it to her.
Natasha, if Faizan is telling you something again and again then try to understand it. Ponder on it. It might be true. Why aren't you getting it?
Enough mother! I won't hear any other word against Raazi
Keep your hatred to yourself. I would never get manipulated against Raazi. I trust him a lot
Really? Are you telling the truth
Yes! I keep my word and brother Saliq too. Now you should also keep your word
Ofcourse, don't you worry. Tell me this, when are you getting my other work done?
Consider it done. I asked brother Saliq to throw a party tomorrow. And I have convinced Faizan to bring Hadia there. After the party, brother Saliq would take his share and fly to Dubai, and Hadia would be out of Faizan's life.
Very good! Does it mean?
Catching two birds with one stone
Listen, you remember the plan?
Yes, I got everything you told me. Don't worry about it. By the way, its a a difficult task but since you are my old friend I have to do it
Thank you Zohaib! Don't you worry, let me enter Safdar Kamal's house for once then you'd see that I'd take care of you too
Its not about that. Look, its a tricky plan so we have to execute it carefully. But remember Ramsha, if I'd get caught then I won't spare you too
Yes I know that you can execute it very well. Just remember one thing, stay in touch with me during party. And don't do something that Faizan would catch you
Faizan shouldn't have any doubt about it. Got it?
yeah!
Good!
You did right thing by coming here
I missed you a lot
I too missed you a lot my child
mother, are you worried about something? You look too worried
No, there is nothing like that
You are hiding something from me. Tell me truly what is it? Your eyes are swollen too
what do I have to hide?
Look, Safdar has found out that Raazi used to like someone
what? Brother Raazi and sister Hadia ..
No, not that. 
Then?
that is what he didn't find out. Thanks to God that He saved my child's dignity
then about which girl brother Raazi told uncle?
mother, I'm not getting it. Tell me in detail
what do I tell you?
and Raazi has agreed to get married next month. I also had to say yes forcefully
so soon?
What could I do, my child? Things were getting complicated
and I can't see my son in this condition. This is why I also said yes
Mother, its always unfair with brother
May God make everything alright. Ameen
Sister Hadia's necklace?
I don't understand what kind of person this Faizan is. He tells fake stories to everyone. Poor Hadia was embarrassed in front of everyone. May God have mercy on both kids
what can we do? Mother, tell where is brother Raazi right now?
He's at office. Meet him and go
Yes! I'll call brother Raazi and tell him that I'm here
I forgot to ask about Hamza in this all. Why didn't he come?
Mother, it is him who dropped me. He was in rush. He had to go somewhere.
Okay! What about your visa?
I got it, mother. This is why I came 
Really? Thanks to God
Thanks to God that I had to hear some good news finally. Now go there and stay happily
but mother, I'd be far from you.
