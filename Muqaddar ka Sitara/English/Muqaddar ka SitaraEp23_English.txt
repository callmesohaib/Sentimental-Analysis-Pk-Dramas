You think that no one would marry me if you'd refuse?
Don't forget it
I'm daughter of Safdar Kamal. Remember it
Raazi
You are here
Go to your uncle. He needs you right now
Let him be alone. He's too worried
I don't believe it that she could do this
God knows who manipulated her taking this big decision?
hmm
its good somehow
now I have got rid of her
Its too late. You go to bed
hmm
I have called her 10 times since morning. She isn't receiving my phone
why are you trying?
Leave her alone. She'll come when she'd have to
She's my daughter. How can I leave her alone?
Greetings!
Greetings! Is everything okay? You are here early in the morning?
Yes, I'm here to meet sister
Okay! I think you have got all the news of this house
You are here for the drama?
No auntie, there is nothing like that
what happened? Is everything okay? Why are you saying this?
Hadia is upstairs. Go and meet her
If any news would leak to your in laws, then remember
I would ban her to enter this house
what?
what was the need of saying this in front of her?
its her fault
how is it her fault? Natasha had to run. She has
Its her fault. Its Fizza's fault
Natasha was disheartened after Nissar rejected her. This is why she ran away
otherwise, she wasn't interested in Sherry
Seriously mother?
yes
how will I live?
At least pick up the phone
I had only one class in university today
I got free early so I thought
to visit you. I'll sit for a while and talk
but when I came here
environment of the house looks disturbed. Everyone is tensed
Brother Faizan seems upset
Is everything okay?
You shouldn't have come without informing. Next time, do inform me
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
that I'd have to inform before coming to your house
it isn't that, Fizza
Everyone is upset at home. You are here suddenly so Faizan and sister would now think
that it is me who leaking things to my family
what happened? Tell me?
Promise that you won't tell anyone, especially father
I told mother because she insisted
fine but what happened?
Natasha left the house
she has left the house? Where?
Look at this
I got food for you from your favorite restaurant
Lunch, dinner, breakfast, its the same routine since I'm here
I'm getting bored now
Natasha, what else can be done in this tension?
Lets go outside. Lets plan a foreign tour
what? how can this be possible?
why? Don't people go on honeymoon after wedding?
I want to go to U.S. and meet my old friends. I want to hang out with them and have fun
you have left your parents in tension
and want to go on foreign tour?
no, at least I'm not this inconsiderate
this is their own tension. Why are you showing this sympathy
because I spent a long time of my life without these relationships
you are lucky
that people who love you and care about you are present in this world
ask me
I don't have these relationships
every moment
I miss these relationships
mother and father
sister and brother
cousins
how much special these relationships are
please, never take these relationships for granted
never hurt your parents
because in this world
these people love us the most
I don't believe that you are saying this all
why?
Am I not a human?
You are forgetting that you encouraged me to run from my house
and now you are blaming me for everything?
that I betrayed my parents and hurt them?
what's wrong with you
yes, I am to blame with you
this is why I have decided that we'll go to your parents today
and apologize to them
we aren't going anywhere. Let them stay worried until they don't realized their mistake
and I took this step to teach them a lesson
otherwise you aren't this important to me that I would have left my house for you
I know it very well.
You only used me for your reasons
but remember it
I'm also using you for my purpose
and my purpose is one
to become son in law of Safdar Kamal
I feel that she wasn't interested in brother Raazi
yes
I don't know why this happened
now see
betrayals ..
this is the game of fate that you two parted ways
what is this fate. It separates two lovers
I used to think so much about him. I used to think so wrong
but trust me
I saw love in his eyes for you
and it was true love
what's the use of all this?
Faizan was written in my fate
if I was at your place
I would have told it to father clearly that I don't want to marry Faizan. I like someone else
Are you gone mad?
the situation I got married, didn't you see it?
I had no other way but to be patient
Faizan was written in my fate
Sister, we get true love only for once. And out of people's fear ..
Enough! I don't want to hear anything on this topic
I'm so sorry. I was just explaining
I was consoling
that .. he isn't like this
He loves your truly. And I have seen it in your eyes
You aren't happy with brother Faizan
Also, the decision they took in rush
He thought you'd live happily your life. Today when he saw you unhappy, he's regretting
I have closed this chapter
you too accept it
I was thinking so wrong about him
I thought so wrong but trust me, I saw love in his eyes for you. True love
what's the use of all this now?
Faizan was written in my fate
If I was at your place, I would have taken stand for myself
I would have clearly told father that I don't want to marry Faizan. I like someone else
What is this? He isn't home yet
Good evening sister! How are you?
you and here?
Sherry isn't at home
I know it. I told him
I'll stay here today
but it isn't appropriate for you to stay here in absence of Sherry
why are you nervous? He's my best friend
it was different before
I live here now. And I don't like you coming here daily
You are getting nervous as if you haven't met any man before
I know open minded girls like you very well
who don't care about dignity when they are running away from house.
But since I'm here, their dignity is at risk
just shut up and get lost
why?
what will you do?
this is my best friend's house. I can come here and stay here anytime
I don't need your permission. Understood?
hello?
Sherry, where are you?
Why are you calling me again and again
What does your friend Rizwan has to do here? Why does he come here in your absence?
He was taunting me
He was staring me oddly. Ask me not to come here again
okay
I will stop him. Anything else?
when are you coming back home?
I can't fly and come
I will take some time
I'm alone at home. I'm scared
You weren't scared when you left home during midnight
Are you saying this, Sherry? I left my house for you
I have left my house in anger
but I feel that I left all my courage back too
and made a big mistake by trusting you
fine! I'm sorry
don't be angry
look
because I love you so much, I get worried when you are stressed
I can't see you like this
this is why I asked you to introduce me to your parents soon so that I could apologize and fix everything
Please, don't you worry. I'm reaching in 10 minutes
bye!
you left home for me?
You left home only out of your ego
You only used me
but I won't leave you this easily now
you got married? Now fulfill it
so this is your real face
marriage with me, and affair with someone else?
I will find out whoever it was. But to scare you, this recording is enough
it will be fun when father would find it out that his pious daughter in law was involved in someone else
now live like this
and see what I'd do
when did you come?
I didn't find it out
how will you know if you will stay lost in someone's dreams
I mean you were having a deep sleep
you can't know it
when I came
you'd be liking it that I come home late
staying alone
and staying lost in someone's memories
do you like it?
nothing
You go to sleep. I have to talk to Ramsha
She must be waiting
what happened? Why are you looking at me like this?
Ramsha is my girl friend
you know this
now you'll talk to her in my presence too?
I will
Isn't it good that I talk in your presence instead of having a secret affair?
Any objection?
Faizan, I'm your wife
Don't you care about my feelings?
no!
Hadia, do you know?
I'm a bad person, and I accept it
but I'm not that bad that I'd have a secret affair with someone
Whatever it is
I do it openly
I'm fearless
I am same inside out. I'm not a hypocrite
and I hate fake girls like you who wear a mask of decency
what did I do?
I didn't hide anything. I am what I am
Really?
You didn't hide anything?
okay
what is this?
I saw love in his eyes for you
and true love
what's the use of this all?
Faizan was written in my fate
this is your reality?
this is what you are?
how innocent do you look. How clever you are
Faizan
it isn't like what you think
You are thinking about your ex-lover while being married to me
secretly at night, you cry for him.
And I am so dumb that I couldn't find it that why isn't my rough behavior and betrayal effecting you
do you know why?
because I don't exist for you. I don't matter for you
For God's sake Faizan, there is nothing like that
this isn't true, believe me
then what's the truth?
who is it that you love?
No one! I don't have anyone in my life other than you, trust me
how do I believe it, Hadia. I saw and heard everything
I swear there is no one in my life other than you
right now?
there was before?
who was it? Tell me? I don't mind
okay, just relax
its life
what's done is done
actually, I'm a broad minded guy
I don't have problem with little affairs
but
what will happen if father would find it out?
it would be a problem for you and your family
by the way, you can share your love story with me
Faizan, listen to me
Fine, whatever it is. I don't have a problem
Faizan, how do I explain?
by the way, I really want to meet the guy. Who is that lucky guy
who loved you and you loved him?
Enough! For God's sake, be quiet!
how fun would it be when this video would be viral in front of mother and father, Hadia?
And what if your parents have seen it?
you won't be able to face anyone
your sister just got engaged. What will happen, man?
you won't do anything
my dignity is yours too
you should have thought it before
I can die but I can't think about anyone but you, Faizan
lets make a deal
I'll keep your secrets, you keep mine
You won't interfere in my matters, and I won't interfere in yours
You shouldn't have any problem if I talk to you in any way. I won't have any with you
You won't complain to father
otherwise, it would be too bad
Why are you worried, man?
I'll return you every penny
you brought her saying 2 days
its been a whole week
what is your plan?
man
I'd have to do something
I am thinking to take her back to her house
I don't have any other option
do quickly what you want to
you don't have much time
If he will come back
there would be a bigger problem
you'd have to vacate this house before he comes
otherwise it would be a problem for me
you don't know Mr. Rizvi
He will take a minute to kick me out of job
I'll do something. Don't you worry
Tell me one thing
Will Natasha keep relationship with you after knowing your reality?
her parents?
would they make you their son in law?
no man
it isn't that easy
I'd have to win their trust first
Mr. Safdar is a dignified man
he has a good social status. He has a big name
he won't let his daughter to get divorced so soon
anyways, after a while he'd have to forgive us
Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Natasha?
Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Where are you going?
Leave my hand. I don't want to listen to you
Natasha?
What you heard is a half truth. I'll tell you the truth
I don't trust you, Sherry. It was my biggest mistake to trust you
Natasha, I didn't want to deceive you. I did everything to get you.
Would you marry me if I had told you my status?
Leave me. Give me divorce right now or else I'll get you locked up behind bars
Natasha, I'm your husband. You can't do any such thing with me.
Natasha? Natasha, listen to me? Natasha? Natasha?
I'm a broad minded person
These little affairs don't effect me
but ..
what if others know?
it would be a problem for you and your family
by the way, you can share your love story with me
how much fun would it be when this video would be viral and come in front of mom and dad.
What about your old parents?
you won't be able to face anyone
and your sister has just got engaged. What will happen?
why are you standing there?
Are you worried?
I won't tell anyone. Don't take tension
Relax
Natasha, listen to me?
Stop following me, before I do something that you'll regret
Natasha listen to me
try to understand. It was a misconception
leave my hand. You'll get papers in few days
Please listen to me
Leave me
Natasha!
hey
why are you taking so much stress?
you haven't slept properly since 3 nights
how can a failed and unlucky father like me sleep?
Please Safdar, don't talk like this
you are giving me pain too by saying so
you know that I can't see you in this condition
please
for me
forgive Natasha
she is your daughter
There is no fracture, they are minor injuries
then why isn't she coming into senses?
that's the medicine. There is nothing to worry about
we will discharge her till evening
you keep this
I'll give you more when the work is done
I will say such emotional dialogues that she will forgive you and go with you
now go
we have to submit this all today
hello?
hello? Greetings! Is Faizan in office?
No, Faizan hasn't come to office yet
is everything fine?
I want to talk important
what is it Hadia?
why do you seem worried? Is everything okay?
Actually ..
look Hadia
He'll blackmail you now
he'll threaten you and scare you
but you don't need to come under pressure
hmm?
look, you didn't do anything wrong
you didn't do a sin
but I accepted that I used to like someone
you used to like me
not don't now
look Hadia
Every person has a past
Faizan also has
infact ..
he still talks to his ex-girlfriend
he meets her
as far as our relationship is concerned
it was a past
it was a fantasy
neither we had a relationship before nor have now
what if he tells this to father?
what respect would have I?
how will I face my parents?
Fizza is about to get engaged
They can even end Fizza's engagement if they'd find it out
No one can do anything. I'm telling you
he can't do anything
he's a coward
how can a person blackmail his own wife?
look .. look Hadia
You and Fizza didn't take my name
then why are you worried?
don't you worry
and as far as that video is concerned
listen to me
its an easy mission
take his cellphone when Faizan is sleeping
and delete that video when you get a chance
Hadia?
I'm telling you, you can do this
I'm with you
thanks
okay!
