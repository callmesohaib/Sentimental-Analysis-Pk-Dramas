yes mother?
Where are you my child? I have been waiting since long. Why are you not home yet?
I'm going to get Natasha
are you going there? but my child ..
I have taken permission from uncle
I will take Natasha out of Sherry's trap
that's fine my child but I'm worried about you
he's a dangerous guy. What if he'd hurt you?
Don't you worry, mother. Your prayers are with me
mother please, pray for me
I want to keep uncle's dignity
my child, take care of yourself. God will give you success
Be careful
Bye!
May God have mercy
Man, do one more robbery at my house
her cousin gave her a very expensive phone
he might have given her some cash
and if ..
not now, he's give it later
okay
let that cousin come two more times
once you have gathered some amount, I'll send my men
I think, her cousin has a doubt on me
he knows everything
fool him
He was revealing my truth in front of Natasha
I handled her on time
Does he know that you did that robbery?
no!
I don't think so he knows anything
then why did he give her the phone?
One should think
but if he had told anything to Natasha, she wouldn't have spared me
she was asking me ..
why did my cousin call you fraud?
now you go. She'd be coming now
but you were saying she has gone for long
yes, but one has to be careful
also, if her cousin appears then we'd be in trouble
Now go! pick up this stuff too
Natasha, when did you come? I couldn't know
the way I couldn't know your purpose of coming into my life
Natasha, lets sit and talk
Raazi was right about you. You are a big cheater
Look, we'll sit and talk ..
Don't touch me! I have heard all your rubbish
Did you get married to me because .. because of my wealth?
Did you do the robbery?
Natasha?
you might have forgotten that I'm a daughter of Safdar Kamal
Enough!
Be quiet! Get lost
what did you think that you'll get rid of me easily?
Sherry?
what do you think of yourself?
huh? what?
Speak up! Look at me?
You will get rid of me so easily?
Natasha, are you fine?
Raazi?
He hit me a lot
so only you were left?
Raazi?
how dare you?
Raazi, he had hit me a lot
send him to jail and take everything from him
take everything from him
I will
I will teach him a lesson
But right now, do this ..
sign here. Sign here
What is it?
they are divorce papers
Sign here
You can't live without money but if you want your life then sign here otherwise you'll spend your whole life in jail
sign it
I am signing
here too
Natasha? Natasha? You ..
Do not look at Natasha again
if you want to stay alive
otherwise I'll kill you
Natasha, don't you worry. We'll go to doctor, okay?
have strength. Come on
Get up! You can do it
come! come!
don't worry
nothing happened to you. Everything is fine
careful
My ears are tired, Ramsha but you aren't done scolding me. Don't you feel pity at me?
Did you really go to check your lands?
I swear I did and I am exhausted
then come back
how far is Murree
Do I look fine?
No, not fine
you look really beautiful
Don't joke, Faizan. Tell me? Is my makeup over?
why did you do makeup?
there is no need, you are naturally beautiful
are you saying it to make me happy?
I can put hand on my heart and say it
that you are the most beautiful girl in the world
this makeup isn't important
shall we go?
Lets go
Father won't let me enter home
why?
why not?
he has disowned me
he hasn't
Look Natasha ..
uncle might show anger 
its his right
what you did was very wrong
also ..
if parents are strict with their children, this doesn't mean ..
that they are doing wrong. Its always beneficial for us
look at your own example
uncle was asking you not to marry Sherry, 
but you did
uncle was forcing you again and again but you still went ahead
now see, what happened?
uncle's decision was proven right
he knew that you didn't deserve that guy
anyways ..
remember one thing
when a person makes a mistake
he should be ashamed of it
and if not ashamed, he should at least apologize
he won't forgive me
why?
why do you think this way?
I know him. He stays on his word. He won't forgive me
I know it well that uncle keeps his word
but trust me, uncle's all decision are proven right till now
Did uncle wrongly choose Hadia for Faizan? 
So did he choose you rightly for me?
what happened?
umm .. nothing
everything will be fine
God willing
Pick up the phone. Its ringing since long
You go inside. I'll take the call and come. Its a client
Come soon, its getting cold
What is it, Ramsha?
I will put hand on my heart and say ..
that there is no other girl more beautiful in this world than you. 
I only love you
you don't need any artificial makeup or jewelry
I like you the way you are
Were you saying this all in a meeting?
how did you hear it all?
leave it. I already know everything from before
that you aren't in Islamabad but in Muree with that Hadia
but I didn't question you
because I wanted you to tell me the truth
but Faizan you keep lying to me
O wow
wonderful! 
so you are still awake? did you see the pictures?
Show them to mother and father too if they are awake
greetings sister?
I was awake because I was studying. I have seen your pictures. You both look amazing
I pray that your pair never catches evil eye
also, I'll go and show pictures to mother and father. They'd be very happy
Take care! Bye
how beautiful is she looking
I can put my hand on my heart
that you are the most beautiful girl in the world
you don't need make up 
are you awake?
yes, come in
is everything okay?
Yes, sister sent pictures. I couldn't hold myself so came to show them to you. See
Its good that you have come
o wow! see
mother, there was a Qawali night. So these pictures are of that event. Aren't they both looking good?
they both are looking great
it seems that Faizan was very happy while taking pictures
yes, he was taking selfies with sister
but my child, do one thing
transfer all these pictures to my phone
you would
then go to hostel. We'd be able to see whenever we'd want.
right father
what happened, father? Why are you crying?
no my child
I'm not crying
umm
when we see our children happy
us parents get teary eyed
actually, when Hadia's proposal was fixed
your mother had many doubts
and because of that
I was too scared
and kept on praying to God
that all these doubts are proven wrong
My respect stays firm in my daughter's eyes
and
I think God has heard my prayers
He helped me
Do send
yes mother
its beautiful
Ramsha, listen to me please
Faizan, there is nothing left to hear now
You are spending vacation with that Hadia. You are romancing and enjoying
you are praising her
and you left me after 2 hrs of wedding
is this my value?
this is why you weren't even picking up my phone
and if you pick it by mistake, then you are in rush to go to spend time with that Hadia
tell me one thing truly
why did you marry me?
Ramsha, we'll talk later. I'm very very very tired
you aren't
you are frustrated of me
you are in love with that Hadia
you want to get rid of me
but get one thing
I will not leave you so easily
Look, if Hadia knew about you, I would have talked to you in front of her
but you know about her, that she's in my life
and its important to give her time
and I brought her here because father asked me, otherwise I wouldn't have
Lie! you are lying again and again.
understand one thing well
I'm not a fool
and I don't believe anything of yours, understood?
If you don't then don't, what do I do?
and honestly, I don't believe that you are being desperate for my love
its jealousy talking. You are jealous that I'm with Hadia and not you
Faizan, you are insulting my love
I purely love you
pure love?
Ramsha, those who love purely don't ask for 500 million rupees as a wedding gift
Faizan, I told you that mother
enough!
you and your mother ..
Are you telling me that this happened without your will? I don't believe it
infact, I think you asked your mother about it
Ramsha, there is nothing like this in love
it is very pure
money reduces love and trust
till today, Hadia never asked me anything
although she knows that I'm son of Safdar Kamal
but she never asked anything
Faizan, I ..
enough!
Ramsha, I won't ignore your right. But please ..
don't force me to think that you only got married to me for my status and money
are you standing here and listening to me? Don't you have any manners?
Why did you lie to me?
when did you come? What did you hear?
These are basic manners and ethics, Hadia
Faizan I ..
what? Don't I have any privacy? Whom do I talk and what do I do? You should know everything?
I should have the same right
What has happened to you, Faizan? I just came to call you. I didn't hear anything
Hadia, do not interfere in my personal matters next time
never
uncle?
someone is here
Natasha?
mother?
my daughter
what happened?
huh? Some accident happened?
Raazi, tell me?
what happened?
don't you worry
Just be thankful
that Natasha is home for ever
Thanks to God
Where is he?
He ran away ..
What? How?
Don't you worry
I have filed a report in police station
problem won't be solved by that only. We should go to police station
uncle, I told you
don't you worry
these are divorce papers
it has all the proofs
this is an evidence for us
that guy ..
is a small thief not a big gangster
police will catch him soon
Ramsha?
Ramsha?
what happened my child? Did you talk to Faizan?
what was he saying? When will he return?
I don't know mother
what is it?
did you fight with Faizan again?
Look, I told you before. This isn't time to fight
He lied to me
He betrayed me and broke my heart
He's enjoying vacations with that Hadia
and I'm alone here ..
Look Ramsha, if you'd keep acting like this
then Hadia will soon make place in his heart
and you'd sit idle
then you tell me mother, what do I do?
Faizan should at least tell the truth. I'm his wife. This is my right
My dear, why do you forget this?
that Faizan's father forced him to marry 
his father might have sent him on this trip
forcefully
huh?
enough my child
everything will be fine
be strong
father didn't even talk to me
he didn't ask
my child ..
he's your father
he's upset
but when you'll go talk to him with love, he'd hug you happily
come, I'll take you to room
come
come
be careful
your son is a here
yes!
no
come!
I'm scared
why?
He's your father. He loves you
come
I have hurt him a lot. He won't forgive me
She doesn't deserve my forgiveness
Safdar please ..
The disappointment I had to face because of you ..
I can't forget it
what is it that I haven't done for your happiness and your luxuries?
what did you do to me in return?
stress ..
problems .
this is what you did
is this how daughters are?
who do this to their father ..
what do I say?
she ..
I have not only taken her out of my house
but my heart too
Safdar ..
where will she go? She has no one
I don't know
she can go anywhere
I told you mother, he won't forgive me
father?
Please? Please, forgive me
I know it ..
that I have hurt you
Please forgive me
I made a huge mistake
I'm not upset
father ..
I fold my hands
Please forgive my old mistakes
you are back home
so think that I have forgotten anything
I have forgiven you by heart ..
now stop crying
How did this happen?
father ..
Sherry ..
he had hit me a lot
he assaulted me
I won't ..
I won't spare him
I will break those hands he hit you with
savage
father ..
I did unfair with you all
I made a huge mistake
she is a lot better now
but she's in depression. She needs mental peace
I'm prescribing her anti-depressants. Give her regularly
Take care of her. Call me if needed
I'm sorry
I spoke too much
you should also trust me. It wasn't just my mistake but yours too
what happened, Faizan
I trust you a lot, more than myself. But I don't know what happens to you. You get hyper
I know, I get hyper. Its a problem
I'm really sorry
forgive me
Fine! But next time if you'd scold me, I'll be upset for ever
fine, you can. But this won't happen I promise
its father calling
Yes, father? How are you? How is everyone at home?
what?
How is she? What happened to her?
I did tell you that this would happen one day. But no one listen to me
I did tell her to come home and apologize but she'd too proud
what are you saying? He has ran away?
Its insane. Fine! Don't worry
Definitely! Okay ..
bye!
umm
Faizan?
Uncle was forcing you again and again but you still got married
now see what happened?
uncle's decision was proven right
he knew that you don't deserve that guy
how dare you?
Raazi, he had beaten me up a lot. Send him to jail and take everything from him
You thought that you won't marry me so no one would marry me?
don't forget that I'm daughter of Safdar Kamal. 
Remember this
Be quiet! Get lost
what did you think that you'd get rid of me so easily?
What do you think of yourself?
huh? what?
Speak up! Look at me?
