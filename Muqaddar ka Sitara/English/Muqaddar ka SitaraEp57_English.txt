Razi... he hit me a lot.
Was this the only thing that was left?
I'm doing this all because of you. It's because I love you.
And... I want to become the girl that you want me to become.
So much happened, you should have at least called to let us know.
I didn't know what to do.
No one helped me. No one believed me. Even Faizan asked me to leave.
Why did you leave with him? Didn't you know how your husband was?
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake in understanding things.
My dear, you aren't the one who made the mistake, we are the ones who made the mistake
We handed you over to brother Safdar.
Razi...
My dear, how can I thank you?
You brought me, my daughter. You protected her and took care of her.
Whatever I said to you, please forgive me for that.
No auntie, what are you saying?
This was my duty. I did you no favors.
I only did this out of kindness.
It was Faizan's duty as well.
To protect her.
He didn't stand by his duty. But you did.
Auntie, don't worry. Everything will be alright. I'll go and meet the doctor.
How's father now?
He'll be fine.
Where's father?
Why Hadia?
Why? Why did you betray me like this?
Why? Why?
Why? Hadia, why?!
I didn't expect this from you.
I was a fool. I was a fool!
I was a fool.
If only I had proposed to you before Faizan.
If I had, then this wouldn't have happened.
If I had you would have been mine instead of Faizan's.
I lost a diamond like you.
Even if I find a magic lamp, I still won't be able to find a girl like you.
Hello?
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm in the car, I'm coming to you.
Weren't you supposed to rest today?
You went to that party with Hadia as well. Tell me, how was that party? I'm sure you must not have enjoyed yourself without me.
I won't go anywhere without you anymore.
You'll be with me... and I'll be with you. I'll declare our marriage. I'll tell the whole world about us.
I'll bring you home.
What about Hadia?
Hadia's chapter is now closed.
What does that mean?
I've decided to remove her from my life.
I don't want anyone to be between us. I want to be yours and stay with you.
I want us to live together and spend our life together. Think of that as done.
No one is between us anymore, nor will there be anyone.
Faizan, I'm so happy. I can't tell you how happy I am to hear this.
Hurry up and come to me. I'm waiting for you.
I'm coming.
Okay bye.
Ramsha... what game are you playing? On one hand, you planning to steal Faizan's wealth with Zohaib.
And on the other hand, you're calling him to you. What do you want, to stay with him, or loot his wealth and run off to Dubai?
I'm considering both options. Because of the wealth Salek gave us, I don't think we can spend the rest of our lives with it.
I was thinking that we should live in Safdar Kamal's home. Faizi has now agreed to take me with him.
What if Safdar Kamal doesn't accept you as his daughter-in-law?
If he doesn't accept me...
then we will run off with the money. Even if I leave Faizan, I won't be at a loss.
Until then I'll be able to steal enough money to spend the rest of our life comfortably. What's there to lose in me considering my options?
I don't understand it. You're playing a dangerous game.
Pray for your father's health.
What happened brother Razi? What are the doctors saying? Is father alright?
Tell me.
I will not give you all false hope.
Uncle Aleem is still in critical condition.
He's on a ventilator.
He has grown weak and because of it, the doctors cannot do surgery.
But they are trying.
To tell you the truth, right now, only your prayers can save uncle Aleem.
I'll go and meet the doctor.
Brother Razi...
Call uncle Safdar, ask him to come here and...
free him from this pain. If he comes here and drives away his misunderstandings...
Then father will be freed from this pain. Call uncle Safdar to bring his son here and make him take back his allegations.
What are you saying?
I'm right mother,
I think uncle Safdar should come here and apologize to him. He should take back the allegations. There is not much time left.
There is no need to be a witness to Hadia's character.
Not one of us doubts her purity and her character.
Both of you are your father's pride.
If someone didn't cherish you two, then that is their loss.
But father...
Hadia...
He's not in that state because of shame. He's not that weak.
He...
Pain..
has broken him down.
This pain was given to him by his closest friend.
Who he trusted and believed. He thought of him as his brother.
I will never forgive brother Safdar.
I will never forgive him.
Father, I'm innocent. I did nothing.
I can swear on the Quran, I didn't do this. You know I'm not like this.
All of these are allegations. There weren't any signals over there. On our way back our car broke down.
Then there were thieves, who stole our phones, and then...
Enough Hadia... how much more will you lie?
Please pick up the phone!
Natasha... soup...
Natasha... my dear...
I cannot...
see you like this.
Natasha, please try and understand...
It's not like you've lost everything.
He was never worthy of you.
Why don't you understand that?
You deserve much better.
My dear, look...
Come back to life. If you close yourself in your room like this...
what will you achieve?
Talk to me... share with me.
Speak about the pain that is in your heart.
But please come out of this.
Natasha, look at me...
Natasha, please.
Be sure to have your soup.
Good morning.*
Your breakfast is ready.
Not now, I have to go.
Faizi please, don't go now.
Father called. Natasha is not well... she's upset, I have to go.
Faizan, why don't you understand?
These short meetings do not fulfill my heart. I want to spend time with you.
Why don't you leave everyone and come to me? Or, why don't you take me with you?
Hadia is not in our way as well.
That day is near. Please wait.
Alright... but please don't go now. My heart sinks when I hear that you're leaving.
Don't worry. Soon I'll be back and take you away from here.
Promise?
Promise.
I'll wait for you.
Razi... my dear how's brother Aleem now?
He's not well.
The doctor said he won't be able to survive more than two days.
The condition is very critical.
May God have mercy. How can this happen?
That is my suspicion...
Your suspicion was correct.
The last person uncle Aleem talked to was aunt Shina.
After that, he had a heart attack.
What has she done? She has ruined their life and her hereafter.
What kind of careless and cold woman is she?
Pray that a miracle happens.
Pray that uncle Aleem is saved.
Tell me, how is Hadia?
She's very upset. She holds her responsible for the entire situation.
What happened to her was bad.
May God create ease for her. Amen.
Amen...
My dear, take good care of yourself and everyone there.
Keep me updated on uncle Aleem's health.
Sure mother.
Farewell*
God, please have mercy. Poor brother Aleem...
How dare you call me? Did you feel no shame in calling me?
Faizan I didn't call to argue with you.
I want to talk to my uncle. I want to tell him something important because uncle Aleem is in the hospital.
He's in a lot of pain. He had a heart attack.
Alright... so? What should I do?
Don't do anything.
Just inform uncle about it. Ask him to come here, meet him, and talk to him.
It's possible that if he apologizes, uncle Aleem might get better.
Faizan please, I request you...
please bring your uncle here to the hospital with you. Try apologizing and see what happens...
Faizan... apologize and take Hadia with you.
Everything will get better if you apologize. Everything will be forgotten. I promise that...
I won't ever interfere in your life.
Didn't you take a lot of time in saying that?
You should have done that earlier. It's an open field for you now.
I will divorce Hadia, then you can marry her. That's what you wanted right?
And what should I apologize for? I wasn't the one who made the mistake, it was you.
You should be the one to apologize, not me.
Brother Aleem is awake and his condition is stable now.
Thank God...
He was asking for Hadia as soon as he woke up.
Who is that?
It's me, I'm his daughter.
You can meet him.
Thank you, doctor.
Hadia my dear... forgive me. 
I wasn't able to make the correct decisions for your life.
I trusted my childhood friend and handed him the most precious thing I had.
Forgive me, my dear. The one responsible for ruining your life...
is me. Only me.
I thought that with time Faizan will change.
But... he turned about to be characterless.
But... he's not the one to blame.
Safdar is the one to blame for this. He was my friend.
He kept lying to me.
I will never forgive him.
You won't ever forgive him as well. Promise me...
that you will not go back to that house.
And you will never forgive them. 
Father, I'll do as you say. I will not hand my child over to that characterless man. I will do as you say. I just want you to get better.
Hurry up and get better. I have no complaints against you. Father...
Father...
Father...
Father... doctor...
Father, wake up. Talk to me, father.
Father... I can't let you go like this.
You can't leave me like this.
I will not let you go.
Father, wake up.
Father, please talk to me. I want to talk to you.
Father, wake up.
Father...
Mother...
I can't see father anywhere. He wasn't at work as well. Where is he?
Your father-in-law has died. He's gone there.
What?
When and how?
I don't know. Some relative called and told him. Your wife and mother-in-law didn't have the decency to tell us themselves,
Your father is there and there is no reason for you to go there.
I should offer my condolences.
For God's sake Faizan, you have no relationship with Hadia anymore.
Please understand that.
Her father had a heart attack after witnessing what Hadia did.
How much grief will we face? One should have some self-respect. End whatever relationship you have with her. Send her divorce papers.
I will marry you and Natasha into wealthy families.
For Natasha, you'll have to find a man from a good family. But don't worry about me.
Why, what does that mean?
I've already married Ramsha.
Are you insane? What nonsense is this? We just got rid of Hadia and now you're after Ramsha.
I don't believe you, Faizan. I will not bring her to this house as my daughter-in-law.
Look at me! Do you understand me, or not?
She has become your daughter-in-law and she is also expecting.
What nonsense is this? I don't believe you, Faizan. I won't let her step a foot inside this house. If your father finds out, he'll kill you.
Do whatever you want. I have married her and she has become your daughter-in-law.
She's going to be a mother soon, so you'll have to accept her. I did marry someone you guys chose before...
and look how it turned out to be.
This won't turn out good as well. Your father knows her.
I have to make a call.
Hello Ramsha... guess what? I've told everyone about us at home.
Get ready... very soon you'll be at Safdar Kamal's home.
This was bound to happen. I had waited for this day for a long time. Now...
I'll see how you'll stop me from coming to your home, Safdar Kamal.
Auntie... please...
Father...
Wait, brother Safdar...
I cannot allow you to touch his casket.
No...
Don't take away my father...
Father...
In the name of the Lord!
In the name of the Lord!
Stop them...
Father... father...
Fizza, they are taking away father.
Father...
You can go back home.
You have no association with this home anymore.
Your friend is gone.
And you've already ousted your daughter-in-law.
Go away from here!
