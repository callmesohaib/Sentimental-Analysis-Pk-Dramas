Faizan...
It's time for your medicine.
I'll clean it up.
I'll bring another shirt for you. I don't want you to catch a cold.
Change.
Iron this.
Forget everything and return to life.
There's nothing left in my life.
Don't say such hopeless things. You're not alone.
Sherry has been arrested today and instead of celebrating, you're being sad?
I'm sad...
because I believed a man like Sherry. I was unable to recognize the good people in life.
I shouldn't have done what I did to you all.
I didn't care for my father's name or the name of my extended family.
I thought Razi was wrong, I doubted his intentions.
But look how good he turned out to be.
He saved me from there and asked father to forgive me.
Do you know, he came to the apartment to make me understand...
I abused him and ousted him.
I was such a fool.
When did he come there?
He came there a few days ago to make me understand.
Mother, if he hadn't come to save me that day...
then maybe I wouldn't be sitting here between you all. Sherry would have killed me.
I'm only here because of Razi.
Otherwise, I don't know what would have happened.
Uncle, this is Natasha's jewelry, cellphone, and cash that the police retrieved from Sherry.
You've fulfilled the promise that you made.
I am grateful to you.
It's alright...
Uncle, I have a request...
What is it?
Please, forgive Natasha from all your heart. I feel...
that she regrets what she did.
I will forgive her...
but if ever again in life...
she tries something like this, then I'll forget that she's my daughter.
I will not only remove her from my inheritance, I will remove her from my life as well.
That is your right, if...
Uncle, the pain that Sherry caused Natasha...
Believe me, she will never do anything like that again.
Again I ask you and auntie to take care of her.
Razi, that guy shouldn't get bailed out. He should be punished most rigorously.
Don't worry uncle. He and his partners will be presented to the court tomorrow.
I hope that the court will punish them strictly.
That is how it should be. What's saddening is...
that she spent so much time with such a man...
I can't tolerate that.
Digging at the past, one can only find sadness.
One should forget it as soon as possible.
If you forget that Natasha had some bad days...
then I want to tell you...
that soon Natasha will escape these memories.
I pray to God that's true.
Sir, the breakfast is ready and miss Hadia is waiting for you.
Alright.
Yes sir.
Ramsha, Faizan is not here.
Let me check.
Greetings...
Where is Mr. Faizan?
Who are you and where did you come from?
We're from Pindi and we've lost our way.
Silence!
Tell him that he has guests from Karachi.
Wait here, I'll tell him.
I'm telling you that Faizan isn't here. It's a waste of time.
You don't know anything.
Look at this beautiful place where Faizan is, with his wife Hadia.
But he has locked me up in that small house. I won't let him get away with this.
You won't let him get away with this?  He won't let me get away with this. I didn't tell him that I was bringing you here.
Yes... if you would have told him, he wouldn't have let me come here. Don't worry, he won't say a word to you. I'll handle him.
Come with me...
Sir, there are some guests here to meet you.
Who?
They are not telling me their name, but they are here from Karachi.
If you want I can call them here.
No, I'll take care of it.
Who can it be from Karachi?
Hey buddy, what a pleasant surprise! When did you get here?
Just right now.
How are you?
I'm fine and you?
Faizi...
How did you like the surprise?
What are you doing? What is she doing here?
Why?
Where's Faizan?
Miss, he's outside, he has some guests from Karachi.
Really?
Ask him to bring the guest inside and arrange for some snacks with the tea.
Sure miss.
Didn't you like me coming here?
I asked you not to do anything like this. Then, what is this?
My husband is so sick and I'm here to ask how you're doing.
I have as much right over you as Hadia. She has tended to you enough...
Now I'm here, tell Hadia to leave for Karachi on the first flight back.
Ramsha, that won't happen. Please don't create a scene in front of Hadia, otherwise, I'm warning you, I'll leave you.
And you... why did you bring her here? Are you insane?
I brought her here? She's the one who brought me here!
Listen... I'll book a room for the two of you, I'll come and meet you. Okay?
I won't go anywhere. I'm your wife and came here to see how you were doing.
And you can't ask me to leave.
I'm forced to do this, try and understand.
I'll book a room for you at the hotel. I'll meet you in the evening.
I'm not going anywhere.
Enough... I've decided that I won't go anywhere. I'll stay where ever you stay.
Please Ramsha, I can't talk right now...
It will be a huge mess. Please go, I'll spend the entire day tomorrow with you.
I don't trust your words anymore.
Faizan...
Sultan told me that your friend was here.
Will you keep them standing, or ask them to come inside?
I was about to ask them when you came.
Introduce me to them.
This is my best friend...
Zohaib.
Greetings*
And this is Zohaib's wife...
Sanam...
Oh... greetings.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm good
They were nearby, so I asked them here.
That's great that you did that. I haven't met any of Faizan's friends, that's why I'm happy that you're here.
Come inside... come inside, Sanam.
Sure, why not?
We need to talk.
For how long are you guys here?
We were supposed to leave the day after tomorrow...
but Faizan had a minor accident and then he got a viral infection...
so we had to stay. We're here for a day... why don't you guys stay with us?
No, they can't stay, you told me that you guys had your flight...
When is that?
Tomorrow.
No for tonight, you told me, so they'll have to leave.
Oh... I was thinking that all of us should go out to dinner tonight.
It's not a problem, we can postpone our flight.
If your husband doesn't mind, we can go to dinner.
Why would he object? He'll get brother Zohaib's company and I will get yours.
Let them go, the airport has a two-hour reporting time. You have that meeting with that multi-national client, right?
Yes, of course.
I'll ask the driver to drop you off.
Not a problem, I'll manage.
I will not let them leave without having dinner.
No need to go through the trouble. We'll visit some other time.
Zohaib what's the matter with you? We should stay if she's insisting.
That's more like it.
Drink tea, then I'll have lunch served.
Great.
Why are you two being so formal? Your plate is empty.
No... thanks.
If you like something else, tell me, and I'll have it made right away.
Actually, I'm on a diet and I don't eat such oily food.
Forget your diet now, you're out to have a good time, so eat. Besides you're so slim and pretty, you don't need a diet.
I'm not prettier than you...
You're very lucky to have a beautiful wife Faizan.
Was it an arranged, or love marriage?
Of course, it was love.
It was arranged, but we fell in love after our marriage, right Faizan?
Eat and I'll ask the driver to drop you guys off.
We'll go as we came. Don't worry about us.
No Faizan, keep this back...
Why, what happened?
The doctor has asked you not to eat spicy food. I've asked Sultan to make soft food for you.
There he is... at least be careful for a few days.
Brother Sultan bring his medicine as well.
Eat this and then you can have your medicine.
Faizan, you are lucky to have such a loving and caring wife.
He's not lucky, I am. He takes care of me, as much as I care for him.
What happened?
My throat is hurting, could you please get the medicine?
I've asked Sultan to get it.
He's taking ages, please go and get it.
Okay sure.
The two of you, get up and leave...
I will not go anywhere.
Zohaib, make her understand.
I'll meet you in the evening, but right now, leave.
Where did they go?
They were in a rush, that's why they left. I tried stopping them, but still they left.
Come on Faizan, they didn't even finish having lunch. You could have at least let them finish.
I have a meeting at night. I might get late, I hope you won't get bored.
But you're not well.
I'm fine now. I feel better.
He was right.
I...
am lucky.
Hey...
Why are you here? What do you want?
I came here to meet you.
Don't come to meet me secret.
I'm your wife, not your girlfriend. You don't need excuses to meet me.
I know but to the world...
I don't care about the world... I'm tired of this. Stop this cat-and-mouse game.
Tell your parents about me.
It's not possible. This can't happen and you know that.
Why?
Do you know why, why do you argue over this again and again?
Faizan, what will happen? How much longer should I wait, watching you enjoy with Hadia?
You told me that this was a forced marriage, and neither of you was happy.
But I think the situation is different. What is going on?
Ramsha, listen to me...
I don't want to hear anything you say.
You're a liar and fraud. Go away from here!
Hadia is the one who is betrayed, not you. Hadia is the one who was cheated on, not you!
What? What did you say?
Initially, I had to come here for a business meeting. Father said Hadia with me, what's so wrong with it?
You told me that you would be here for a few days, it's been a week, I'm alone there and you don't care at all.
I was in an accident, don't you care about that, can't you see? Why are you fighting over this?
I came here for you today... let's just go somewhere, we can talk about this some other day. Let's ruin our mood.
I don't want to go anywhere with you. Go to your beautiful wife Hadia.
Who you had an arranged marriage with and then fell in love with? I'm the one who is a foo.
I think there is a misunderstanding between us.
I think we should drive this misunderstanding.
But I don't think that.
Misunderstandings are cleared where there are relationships and we don't have relationships.
You're a good man... there is no doubt about that.
But now...
I don't need your sympathies or your help.
May God give you happiness.
Wherever you are...
be happy.
Faizan... get up.
Not now, I'm very sleepy.
You're bound to be, you were out all night. You don't care about your health at all.
I'll ask father not to ask you to attend late-night meetings.
What?
No, don't tell what father said, he'll think I asked you to say such things. I'm up...
He already taunts me over everything. Wouldn't you like it if he sees me working?
Alright, I won't say anything. Drink your tea and let's go outside. I want to shop for everyone today.
I'll spend the entire day with you today. I'll go wherever you want.
But I have to attend the meeting in the evening.
Okay... drink your tea and then we'll leave.
It's... hot.
Sorry...
The tickets are here, we have a flight tomorrow.
Okay, I'll pack everything on time.
Sure...
Alright, drink your tea and come outside.
I thought Razi was so wrong. I used to always turn him away.
And he didn't even care for my life for me.
He freed me from a man like Sherry. He unveiled Sherry's true face to me.
If it weren't for Razi, then maybe I wouldn't be in this home today.
I was spending a life of helplessness with Sherry...
And father maybe would have removed me from his inheritance. No matter how much I thank Razi isn't enough...
Razi, our Chinese delegation is in Islamabad. Our contractor has a meeting in Burban with them.
Faizan is not well, and he won't be able to make it. See that this is sorted.
What happened, is everything alright?
He's been sick for the past few days. I want you to meet that delegation...
I want to start the construction as soon as possible.
Alright, as you wish.
Book your ticket as soon as possible and give a presentation as soon as possible.
I will call Faizan.
Don't do that. He's not well...
Let him rest. I want him to spend some time with Hadia.
As far as you are concerned, you can handle business matters better than him.
Sure... I'll do that. Don't worry about that.
Thank you, my dear.
Sure Mr. Mazhar...
Alright, book me on the flight that's leaving in four hours...
Alright, thank you...
Brother Razi, mother said to keep warm clothes, it will be cold there.
I've already done that.
What is this? Are you going right now?
I've got an early flight, so I'll have to go.
Why, what happened?
Brother...
Are you alright?
Yes... I'm fine. What's with you?
No, I was just asking.
It's good that uncle Safdar sent you out of the city. This way you'll get out of this tense environment.
Look... I'm going to work, not to have a picnic.
I know that, when the work is done, then you can have a picnic.
If you're finished, may I leave, I'm already late.
I was talking in your favor...
I beg you to stop. 
Take care and come back soon.
You take care as well...
Please, keep mother away. She's very sarcastic.
And... as soon as possible.
Okay? Okay... bye...
Razi...
I wanted to say something to you.
What is it?
I wanted to apologize to you and I wanted to thank you as well.
No, it's okay.
There is no need for you to apologize.
No, there is. I always thought you were wrong...
I always degraded you, but still, you played on your life and saved me from that place. You saved my life.
I don't know how to thank you and apologize to you.
Look, Natasha...
you are embarrassing me. If you want to apologize to someone, apologize to your mother and father.
You've hurt them, right?
Razi, I cried in front of father for forgiveness in front of you...
But he hasn't forgiven me. He doesn't talk to me, he doesn't even look at me.
I don't think his heart will ever be clear regarding me.
Don't worry.
Give him time, slowly he'll forget everything.
And he'll behave normally with you again.
I will...
But please, forget everything and forgive me.
Can't we become good friends?
On one condition...
What?
The condition is simple, you have to take care of your parents.
Don't ever worry about them. Promise me this...
Definitely, I accept it. Shake my hand now.
Haven't you forgiven me?
I was never upset with you.
Now please, you don't need to keep apologizing to me.
You look more sensible and mature to me than before...
And... promise me that you won't do anything like that again, alright?
I won't.
Good luck...
When are you coming back from Islamabad?
Soon...
Take care...
You take care as well.
Hello mother, how are you?
You tell me, how are you?
You didn't tell me how you were doing, once you reached there.
What are you saying?
How can I forget you? Who do I have instead of you and Faizi?
How's Faizan? Is everything alright?
Was he upset at you, seeing you there?
No, rather I was upset at him...
He came to Islamabad with Hadia, without telling me.
Did Hadia recognize you?
No Faizi made an excuse...
He told me that I was his friend Zohaib's wife.
What?
And you let this happen? Didn't you stop him from doing this?
No mother... I wasn't able to do anything for the moment.
But, see what I'll do with Hadia...
If I don't remove her from Faizan's life, then my name isn't Ramsha.
Mother, I have to go now. I have to get ready and go for lunch.
Alright fine. Take care, and keep me updated on things. Bye.
