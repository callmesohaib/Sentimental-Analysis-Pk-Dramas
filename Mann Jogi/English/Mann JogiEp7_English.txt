You should treat him like a student or an assistant,
which is his rightful place.
He will understand all the ways in a single day
and he will become mature too.
Can’t you see the danger I am facing?
I can see that but you also become brave.
I have to leave early in the morning.
I came to take my black suit.
If its not pressed then give it to me, I’ll do it myself.
No, no, I had pressed it.
Here you go.
You keep him close to you all day long.
And you make the poor soul sleep on the floor at this time.
Forget about what others are saying…
And talking about.
Focus on what you want.
And most importantly, what does he want?
What would that poor man can desire for?
This the problem that you think of him as helpless.
He doesn’t even take my name.
He starts shivering if he tries to become informal.
There is a lot of distance between us.
Do you want to end this distance?
Buddy, I just want to live with him…
No matter how he chooses to live with me.
Then tell him about this.
The poor man thinks that you will be ok without him, nothing will happen to you.
Tell him this, it’s important.
You take a day off tomorrow.
Forget it, I will talk to Aunty myself.
Ok?
Come…Sit, sit.
Have a seat, please.
You please, sit down.
No, no, please sit.
No, no, I will not sit.
Look, there are couples all around, please, have a seat. Please.
Sit.
Look, its valentine’s day.
Everyone expresses their inner most feelings.
You two also have to share your feelings.
Ok?
OK.
I am standing right at the gate, I will not let you go, if you guys don’t talk.
And I will order food for both of you.
Ok?
Ok…and what about you?
I also have someone.
You have to talk.
OK.
Huh!
Say something, please.
First, you speak, tell me something about yourself.
Once, liked a girl.
Nomads, they were shepherds.
Every year, during the summers…
She used to come along with her cattle.
I used to wait for her.
Do you miss her?
Boys were scared of me.
She being a girl, dared to confront me.
So…
Do you like girls who are always fighting?
Ibrahim, there are so many aggressive girls in our hostel as well.
Bushra…
Umm…Salma, Naureen.
Which one do you like?
Aliya.
I like Aliya Madam.
Do you find me aggressive?
No.
You look brave.
The one who fights for herself.
So…actually…
Did you have a love marriage?
No, no…no.
Ibrahim, I truly fell in love with just one man.
With whom?
My Father.
He was a very nice man.
My marriage with Shabbir was arranged.
When Fathers die, sisters become a burden on brothers.
Yes.
Yes, but Shabbir says that he fell in love with me.
Anita sister has brought us to a good place.
Happy valentines.
Bunty!
Keep sitting, keep sitting.
You must have been tired…after a long shopping.
And…what have you bought for Shabbir today?
You are roaming around with his measurement.
Keep sitting brother, keep sitting, keep sitting.
I have also come here to celebrate valentines.
And tell me something…
Couldn’t you refuse to me personally?
If you did not want to meet me then you should have said it clearly.
Why did you make me confront that old lady?
And I am not interested in meeting you.
It was actually Bubbly who was repeatedly mentioning you and wanted to meet you…
Before leaving.
Where did bubbly go?
America…
Breast cancer.
God knows, if she comes back or not.
Anyways…
You celebrate valentines.
Why would you care?
I shall go.
I met Aliya yesterday.
Hmm.
Which secret place?
She was celebrating valentines.
Wow! Great!
Mr. Chaudry is having fun.
She was with someone else.
No way.
I used to idealize this girl a lot.
She turned out to be so cheap.
Who was the man?
I can’t believe it.
Tell me.
He is the Muezzin in his mosque.
Look at her standards.
Do you know him?
She used to roam around with him…
Making an excuse of shopping for Shabbir.
Aaa.
Shabbir has made a big issue of this.
He has filed a report against him.
Obviously…
There will be an issue.
He is not blind.
All tasks will be carried out in the same way.
Cleaning, tidying up, maintenance, cooking.
And laundry will be fifty, fifty.
Food and accommodation are free.
Now you decide the salary.
You decide, we don’t know, whatever is fine with you.
We have thought of 25000.
25 each?
No, no…we count both of you as one.
Both of you work together, right?
Ok, forget it.
With his assistance….
I will give you 5000 more.
I can’t increase more than this.
Ok?
Come on get up, start working, there is a lot to do.
Come on, get up.
Come on, get started, get started.
Greetings Mr. Chaudry!
Greetings Mr. Butt!
So, Mr. Butt, did someone offer you any cooldrinks?
No, no, Mr. Chaudry, there is no need.
I am in a rush.
Tell me, why did you call me?
Buddy…what’s the Muezzin’s issue?
I don’t know, Mr. Chaudry…
But it seems like pointless political ploy.
Otherwise, how much money could there be in the charity box?
This much money is spent, if two people go out for a meal.
He would have had spent it by now, how will we recover it?
No, no, Mr. SHO.
The matter is serious.
Your special attention is required in this case.
I think, that boy has runaway with some other valuables too.
Tea is good.
Yes.
Dusting, cleaning, mopping, he does everything very well.
Do you know how to make coffee?
No.
He doesn’t know how to make coffee but he doesn’t know how to steal as well.
Nothing will go missing from the kitchen to the cabin.
And if it does then I will be responsible.
It’s my personal guarantee.
Hmm.
Done!
Thank you!
Let’s go.
Aliya Madam!
Aliya…
Leave everything and have sweet.
For what?
Have it and then I will tell you.
Oho!
May I feed you?
Actually…I have got a job.
Where?
At Anita Sister’s office.
Day and night duty for five days…Two days off.
Salary is 40,000.
Aliya Madam, didn’t you like it?
Telling me about groceries, did you go to find a job with her?
Oh no, it was Anita Sister’s idea, she asked me.
Don’t lie.
Aliya Madam, I don’t lie.
What is it then if it’s not a lie?
You leave for something else and you return doing something else.
It’s is a lie, right?
Don’t try to fool me.
Aliya Madam, you are taking it wrong, I haven’t...
Ibrahim, leave from here at the moment.
Go, I am working, distribute the sweet among the others.
OK.
How can he do this?
He is bound with us.
He has signed an agreement.
Show me his agreement.
Verbal commitment holds some value.
Aunty, innocent people have no language.
And by the way, Aliya is your employee.
You are getting Ibrahim for free anyways.
Ok then he may take Aliya along.
We don’t need them.
Think about it, Uncle.
Aunty, Ibrahim, is getting a package worth 40,000, they both will manage very easily in that.
Its you, who will be in trouble.
Will you get someone like Aliya in that money?
Think about it.
Ok, ok.
If Aliya can do it then ask her to carry on.
OK.
I have talked to them, they have no objection.
I do have an objection.
Bushra is right, you will never let him out of your reach.
Yesterday, you were talking about reducing the distance and today you are increasing it.
Oh Aliya, let him meet himself first, only then he will be able to meet you.
You are worth 25000 and he is worth 5000, who is a good for nothing for you.
Where would he gain his confidence from?
How will he stand by you?
Buddy, he can’t manage alone, he is very innocent.
Stop it, stop talking rubbish, buddy.
You can’t get over your high stance of being Mrs. Chaudry.
You want a man, whom you can support.
I don’t lie, Aliya Madam.
I have never lied to you.
I know, Ibrahim.
Why did you fight with me then?
You got upset for no reason.
No.
I was not fighting with you but I was fighting with my own self.
Honestly speaking, I can’t understand anything.
Anita Sister said that you will be very happy when I will tell you, I had no idea that you will…
You will get upset like this.
How should I explain it to you man, you will not understand?
Try to explain it, I will understand.
Let me understand it myself first, Ibrahim.
Aliya Madam!
Look…I don’t even know how much is 40,000, how are they supposed to be spent,
what can we buy with it?
Anita Sister told me that you will be happy, I was doing it for you, that is enough for me.
Things will go as per your wish.
If you will say go to office, I will go to office,
if you will ask me to keep sitting with you, I will stay with you all day long but…
Things will happen as per your desire, you just…
Don’t get upset with me.
I don’t like it.
Give it to me.
I shall leave.
Take care of yourself.
You too.
Bye!
Ibrahim, give me the tester.
Ibrahim!
This…
Did you do this?
Yes.
I went to the market with Anita…
So, I bought it.
It was there in your room, right?
Did you like it?
A lot.
Aliya Madam!
Thank you!
I liked it very much.
And this…
This…
This looks exactly like my village.
Isn’t it?
Yes, exactly.
When I saw it, I also felt the same.
Yes.
Awesome!
Ibrahim, where do you sleep over there?
In the kitchen.
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
I sleep well.
Liar!
No, no, honestly, you know, I am habitual of sleeping on the floor so, I sleep.
Aaaa…
Come here.
Sit here.
Sit.
What are you doing?
You will sleep here.
Oh no, what are you talking about?
Ibrahim sir, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You sleep here.
No, no.
Sit.
Aliya Madam, it will not look nice that you sleep on the floor and I sleep up here.
I will not feel comfortable, I am used to it, you come here.
Ibrahim!
I also have become habitual.
I have been sleeping here, since you left.
I like it here.
Really?
Come.
Greetings!
Wow! Great!
You look so change today.
Ibrahim!
You look like a gentleman.
Thank you!
You also look very nice.
In fact, together, you both look very good.
Actually…
We needed a day off.
Why?
Actually…
I am taking Aliya Madam out for dinner.
Are you taking her out for dinner?
Look, don’t lose him once again.
It’s the only piece.
No, I don’t need money.
I have money.
He has brought advance.
Really?
Ok…then go.
Be happy and enjoy.
Thank you!
Bye!
It’s a very nice place.
How did you get to know about it?
Actually…
I came with Anila Madam.
Who Anila?
The one in the office.
Aliya Madam!
May I sing for you?
Did you sing it for Anila as well?
No, why would I sing for her?
Then she must have sung one for you.
No, why would she sing for me?
Why did you come here then?
To pick up food.
She was getting married, so she had invited the office staff, that’s why I came.
Ibrahim! Ibrahim!
Go and sing now.
May I go?
Go.
This song…
Is Aliya Madam’s favorite that’s why it is for her.
The word has reached Zubair.
He has assigned personnel to find Ibrahim.
And has given strict orders from the authorities as well.
I will bring tea for you.
Don’t handle me like a child.
But you are my child.
Mother!
Mother!
I feel like everybody has got to know.
Everybody stares at me, Mother.
Mother!
Everybody is staring at me, Mother.
Yes, everybody will look at you…
Why wouldn’t they look at you?
You are not an ordinary person.
My status will become even lower than the ordinary, Mother.
All my politics will be ruined, if Zubair get to know about it.
Mother!
Mother!
Earlier, you were praying that she should be found.
Now…now, please, you have to pray…
That she doesn’t get caught by the police, Mother.
Mother, will you?
Mother!
Sure, sure.
Don’t you worry.
Don’t worry, everything will be fine, don’t worry.
Don’t worry, my child.
Have patience.
Ibrahim!
Yes, Sir.
Buddy, you can’t get a day off today.
Pervaiz’s wife is very ill.
He was pleading that…
Ok?
Sir…
Aliya Madam must be waiting at home, I had told her that I will come, she will get upset.
You will get paid for the overtime man.
Two or two and half thousand cash.
Give it to her when you go home.
She will become happy.
And we have a misunderstanding that they are missing us.
Aliya Madam!
What did you understand?
Sir, but…
You can’t get it man.
Ok Sir.
OK.
Hmm.
What special is being cooked for him today.
Nothing.
Why do you hide?
You are the one, who hides.
You made my entire film that day and you hid your valentine.
I would have shown, if there would have been someone.
Don’t talk rubbish.
My favorite.
I will give you only, if there is any left.
All of it will be left today.
It’s his favorite, he doesn’t leave it.
I will give you, if there is some left.
Your poor man is not coming today.
He is working overtime on the weekend.
I came to tell you this.
Give this paper in the accounts department.
Ok, Sir.
Aliya Madam!
You here?
Have you come alone?
This is Aliya Madam.
She is my wife.
Hello Mam’
Is everything alright?
No.
Tell me, what has happened?
Do you want to create a scene before the entire office here?
Come inside…come.
Come, come inside.
What happened?
Tell me, is everything alright?
Aliya Madam, you look worried.
Tell me, what has happened?
Aliya Madam, you look very worried, tell me.
Why would you care?
You keep sitting in greed of a little money.
I do care.
what someone is going through, you have got nothing to do with that.
No Aliya Madam, I am doing all this for you only.
Are you doing it for me?
What did I ask for Ibrahim?
What did I ask for that you have become so greedy?
What are you getting here that you keep me waiting there and completing your over time hours here?
I thought that you…
What are you getting which is more important and precious for you than me waiting?
It’s nothing, I thought you will be happy that I am working.
Will I be happy?
I made a mistake.
Ibrahim, I don’t want all this.
I want nothing.
I want you.
I want you Ibrahim, can you understand?
I can’t live without you, not even for a day or an hour or a minute.
You have fever.
Sit comfortably.
Put your feet up.
Here you go.
Finish the water.
Did you bring him last night?
No.
He brought me.
He kept putting cold strips too all night long.
Congratulations!
He has been fired from his job.
Hello!
I have found Anita’s address, Brother.
She works in some call center.
You will rot in this dark cell all your life.
And she will spend her entire life washing dishes...
For a stranger.
I have come to inquire about Ibrahim…
Why have you arrested him?
What is your relation with him?
He is my husband.
Oh, don’t do it.
Oh! Oh! For God’s sake, don’t do it, brother.
Stop it, brother, Oh! Oh! Don’t do it.
Oh!
Aaaa!
