Ibrahim, shut the door.
Shut the door.
I divorce you!
Oh Shabbir, no.
Shabbir, no.
No, Shabbir.
I divorce you!
Shabbir don’t do this.
I divorce you!
Prayer is better than sleep.
Prayer is better than sleep.
God is the greatest, God is the greatest.
There is no God but Allah.
Where are both of them?
Where are they?
Haven’t they reached yet?
Hurry up, dear.
The time for call to prayer is running out.
Be quick.
They might have gone from the next street…
To avoid being seen by people.
Aliya!
Aliya!
Shabbir, what happened?
Aliya hasn’t returned yet, isn’t it?
No, what happened?
What has happened?
Wait Mother.
Tell me, what has happened?
Aliya!
Oh my God, what has happened?
Who are you calling?
Hey!
Shabbir, tell me something.
What has happened?
What…Where is the phone ringing?
She has run away.
I made a mistake, Aliya Madam.
Be careful!
Be careful! Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Stay here, I will bring it.
Greetings!
Noora, at least, look at how I am sitting,
you just let anyone in the house.
Madam, he is not a stranger, he is our Ibrahim.
He is the mosque’s servant.
His and the Religious Scholar’s meals…
Go from here only.
Forgive me, I didn’t know.
Let Mother finish her prayers and then
she will give you the food.
Actually…
Madam…
asked me to bring the motor.
Ibrahim, come here.
Hmm?
Come here, come here.
Yes.
This belt…yes, hold it tightly…yes.
Just a minute!
Leave it.
Leave it, leave it.
Turn on the switch.
Hmm?
Switch.
From where?
Inside.
Turn it on.
It’s the second button.
Who is Chaudry Zubair?
Hmm?
Who is he?
Where does he stand? What is his worth?
He is funded by the British government.
He has been paid, to get his own people arrested…
These lands…Over which he parades as a landlord.
You are absolutely right.
This business, these shops,
where has this come from?
His Father is a subservient to his officers.
He is a fraud.
He is a thief….a robber
One holds a character.
What is this cheap man’s character?
He is a thief, a thief.
All the funds of the municipal committee…
He has collected in his trunk.
What has he turned this town into?
Broken roads, dirty streets, sewers.
If I don’t drag him into these streets…
Then I am not Chaudry Shabbir.
Your Brother, my Brother…
I will rip open his stomach…
And take out, all your money.
Your Brother, my Brother!
Make my hands stronger.
I will make sure he faces the consequences.
Your Brother, my Brother!
Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
Your Brother, my Brother!
May I help you?
Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
No, it’s almost done.
Take this.
Your Brother, my Brother!
Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
And bring the dirty dishes, if there are any.
Sure, ok.
Where are both of them?
Apparently…
He has taken nothing with him.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Sir!
Once during my childhood, my ball fell
into the neighbor’s house.
They were not returning it.
Four people’s head…
Two arms…
And a leg…I broke and injured all
these and brought my ball back.
That was just a ball.
This is my wife.
No one will be spared.
Not even you.
Don’t you want to go to school?
You don’t want to go?
Don’t go.
Don’t eat my brains.
You are always whining.
I have told you so many times not to raise
your hand on my daughter, leave her.
Am I raising my hand?
I am scolding her.
You go ahead and fulfill her demands.
Come and sit.
I don’t have a single penny.
What is the matter? What does my Princess want?
I want a trolley bag.
All my friends have it, I can’t carry so many books.
That’s it?
Yes, that’s it.
Do you know, how much is the trolley bag for?
It’s for 5000 rupees.
Ok tell me, what is the date today?
17.
17…So…
How many days are left for the
next month to start? 13 days.
Do you know how will you carry your bag then?
Like this.
Like a trolley.
Wow! Great!
You and your sister…
Both are experts in making a fool out of the girl.
She also said that she will get a trolley bag.
Since that day till date, the bag never came.
Where is the phone?
Did you have breakfast?
What did you eat?
Bread and peas.
Your sister has a very long life.
I think, your trolley bag has arrived.
There you go…
It’s your Aunt’s call.
She must be missing you.
Talk to her.
Good morning Aunty, where are you?
What?
Give it to me
Hello!
It’s me dear.
Yes, greetings Aunty.
How are you?
God is great, you tell me, how are you?
All is well, how are things with you?
Has Aliya arrived safely?
No.
Aliya left for your house early in the morning.
No Aunty, she has not reached here….
Is everything alright?
She has not reached?
Yes, both husband and wife had a fight.
The husband left for somewhere
and she left for somewhere.
It’s like this.
This is very strange, one doesn’t
leave the house like this.
Its ok.
Safely…
When she reaches safely, let me know.
I am worried.
Ok Aunty, I will let you know and I will
talk to her too, when she comes.
No, no, don’t say anything to her, don’t
make a fuss, just keep her there.
You just inform me, I will come and talk to her myself.
And listen…
You will not talk to her, you don’t know anything…..Did you get it?
OK.
Just make her stay there, ok?
Ok Aunty, you don’t worry.
Ok, may God protect you.
Oh my God!
Leave it, leave it.
I said leave it.
If she needed to get home, she
would have had arrived by now.
So… What will you do? What will you do then?
What do I do then? Should I keep sitting idle?
Yes.
Leave it.
Mother, don’t test me.
I said, leave it.
Leave it.
Shabbir, this is not your politics…
That you will stand on the main
road and utter rubbish,
and someone will come running
to put a hand on your mouth.
One doesn’t find a fish by only jumping into the river.
One has to put a fish trap and wait patiently.
Will she come back home by herself?
What will you do then?
Tell me, what will you do?
Neither you have a clue about the girl
nor are there any traces of the boy.
You will keep roaming around, with a toy
in your hand…And will keep firing.
Will the people not hear the silence in this house?
Look!
You get hold of yourself.
Let me handle the rest.
For how long Mother? For how long?
I can’t understand it myself that what has happened?
Neither has Aliya got the guts to run away…
Nor that boy has the courage to make her run away.
Look!
Cool down and think about it.
Just think, that…
that what has happened?
How has this happened?
Huh?
Come on…
Cool down…
Calm down…
Mother, leave me.
Come on, my son.
Keep quiet.
Be brave!
Coming! Be patient.
People don’t want to wait.
Wait, I am coming.
Aliya!
Greetings!
Greetings!
You are here so early in the morning,
is everything alright?
What has happened?
Who is inside?
Who would be inside?
You are making me anxious.
Where are you going?
Come.
Who?
Greetings!
Greetings!
Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Sit right here.
What have you put in Aliya’s room?
Some round sweets.
Where have you brought it from?
From my home.
You did not have money to buy
5kgs of flour till yesterday…
Today, you are distributing sweet.
My husband has returned from Lahore last night…
Tell me honestly.
I swear Madam.
You will get beaten up, liar!
You have put it twice earlier as well, isn’t it?
I can swear upon the Holy Book
madam, I am not lying.
You have started paying visits to Chaudry
Zubair’s house, right?
Not me, she sent it through my Sister in law.
Leave.
Madam, listen to me.
I said, leave from here.
Madam, I have small kids.
Don’t show me your face from today onwards.
Madam, listen to me at least.
Really?
You get fed here and bring sweet from there.
Madam!
Leave from here
Chaudry Zubair, sent it through his wife.
Get lost from here.
Shameless!
She would have had come every day
and asked about her.
You have already given up, Mother.
Whether the journey is long or short…
One should not carry unnecessary burden, dear.
Show me.
No, no,
I did not tell anything.
That boy…
Who calls out to prayer in the mosque…
Yes.
He has come with her.
Will you ask me everything on the phone?
Come here quickly.
Hurry up!
Come quick.
Brother left early today.
Yes.
He has gone to drop Rimsha to school.
She had created a fuss…
That she wants a trolley bag…
So,
She missed the bus too.
He has taken her along with great difficulty.
She doesn’t let us buy it.
She says that Aunty has promised me…
I will take it from her only.
Will you not tell anything?
What has happened?
Did you have a fight?
No problem.
Husband and wife, do fight over petty issues.
Don’t you remember…
Afshan and Mehmood?
Such a trivial matter, had escalated
to the point of divorce.
If your husband would not have
had intervened that day…
They would have gotten divorced…
Here…
Sitting right here, she used to cry here all day long.
Listen!
A man’s anger…
Is like a cracker.
Such huge noise…
And …
such a small spark.
The far you stay away from it, the better.
Or you will burn yourself.
Listen!
A woman’s clothes catch fire first.
Do you have an ointment or something
else to apply on the wound?
Najma: Open this cupboard and see…
It must be inside it.
Ok tell me…
What will you have in breakfast?
Eggs,
flat bread,
chicken and peas,
beef stew.
Tell me quickly, Usman will bring it on his way back.
Nothing.
Listen!
Your Mother in law called…
A while ago.
Your husband has also run away from the house.
The poor woman is very worried.
Tell me honestly…
What has happened?
What is the argument about?
Sister in law, don’t tell anything
to anyone at the moment.
Ask Brother also not to.
Here you go.
The bathroom is at the back.
Clean it properly, or it will get infected.
Coming.
Greetings Brother!
May you live long.
Listen!
Sit.
You go to the bathroom.
I hope you didn’t inform her Mother in law.
She is asking not to.
She didn’t fight or argue over a small issue.
There must be a big problem.
Whether the problem is small or big…
Go and drop her to her house.
This will maintain respect for both you and us.
Don’t prolong the matter.
Go
OK.
Ahem
May I go?
Do I have your permission?
Have breakfast at least.
No…
I will get late.
Where will you go?
To the mosque.
I will go there only.
They will kill you.
I have to go after all.
Let me talk to Brother in front of you,
we will think about it later then.
OK.
Its Zubair’s wife.
Which prison cell are you living in?
Even the prisoners in the jail have the
permission to eat and drink.
You don’t have that even.
Yes, Mrs. Chaudry, you are absolutely right.
It is exactly like this.
Aliya is living a prison cell, she doesn’t
get to eat or drink and…
She is not allowed to meet anyone as well.
Please, don’t trouble yourself too.
For no reason….
You will get disheartened
Aliya!
Take this phone.
And you are not allowed to answer anyone’s
call also from today onwards.
I will just tell them that you have reached safely.
She sounded very worried.
Brother, you will call them,
their problem will get solved…
But when you people will get disturbed,
there is no limit to that.
You forget it, I will talk to them in my own way.
It’s not going to create a disaster.
Ok then, you talk to them…
Resolve their troubles, I shall leave.
Ok, sit…
Sit down.
This conflict did not start last night, Brother.
It actually ended last night.
I have been enduring extreme stress for
the past three months and ten days.
Najma.
Yes.
Take Brother inside, serve him breakfast, let us talk.
We will discuss it in his presence.
Aliya!
Household matters should stay within the house.
Come on Brother, get up.
Come Brother.
No, keep sitting Ibrahim.
Ok fine.
Get up, we shall go inside and talk.
Yes, come.
We will talk right here.
Aliya!
Why are you dragging this poor man in this?
Things will leak out tomorrow…
Your husband will mind it.
Which husband?
Shabbir has divorced me.
This is my husband, Ibrahim.
I got married to him last night.
And Shabbir himself, has got this marriage done.
Is she gone?
No.
You will go and drop her.
These are your clothes.
Shoes…
Suit….
She bought them today only.
Wear this and get ready, come on.
Let’s take the drummers along too.
Let’s take the entire wedding procession.
You stay busy with your processions and rallies.
How would you know the joys
of a wedding procession?
She went today.
She went with Ibrahim.
To buy shoes, clothes, vests, socks for you…..
And so many other things she bought.
She met Zubair’s wife there, who dragged her along.
And she went along.
Her daughter had passed away.
It’s a cat, which has died Mother.
She also got to know after she reached there.
And when she was running away…
Your enemy’s procession arrived, right then.
You should have asked.
You should have listened to her for once at least…You should have let her explain,
should have let her speak.
You did not listen to her at all.
You should have believed in whatever
she would have had said…
After that you could have scolded
her as much as you wanted…
You could have killed her.
You should have listened to her once at least,
to know what she has to say.
What did you do? You destroyed everything,
you ruined everything
You buried your own joys, along with the cat.
What did you do? What did you do?
What did you do? you fool, what did you do?
Stay away…Just stay away…we have been
ruined; we have been destroyed.
Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Nothing has happened.
She is forbidden for you….Leave her hand.
I said, leave her hand.
Mother, what is wrong with you?
I said it out of anger.
Does someone give a divorce out of love too?
Ok, I will give charity Mother…
What is wrong with you?
There is no room for adjustments in Islamic laws.
Mother, God is the witness, I was
not in my senses at that time.
This is not your political statement…
Which you can change the next day.
It is not your government but
it’s about the rules of God.
Ok, it’s between me and my God, ok?
Ok fine.
Then I cannot stay under the same roof.
Then go and drop her at her place.
Don’t let him hold your hand.
God will curse you.
The divorce has been done.
There is no doubt about it.
Seeking any excuse in this regard…
Is against the Islamic laws.
Neither
charity,
alms…
Nor repentance…
Can invalidate this.
That woman…
Is no longer bound by your marriage.
Sir!
You are like our family member.
The entire situation is before you,
you know about everything.
The ups and downs of our house, the problems…
Everything…and…
You know
about his nature too.
You are aware of our honor as well.
Being our own, give us an advice
which could resolve this matter.
God says…
That if a husband gives a divorce, then she…
That is the woman…
Will not be lawful for that man…
Until…
She marries another man.
Then, if he…
that is the second husband…
If he divorces her…
There is no sin on either,
if they come back together…
And remarry…
Provided they believe they will uphold God's limits.
And all of this…
is part of God's boundaries…
Which He makes clear for those…
Who understand.
