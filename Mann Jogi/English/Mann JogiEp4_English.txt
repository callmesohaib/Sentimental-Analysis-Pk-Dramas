No, no, Aunty, not Ibrahim.
Why?
Why not Ibrahim?
If, not Ibrahim then…
Have you found someone else?
A suicide attempt has been made…
Because…
I have seen them both alive.
Divorce…
How…?
Here…?
Right now?
Divorce…
No, no divorce.
This is what was decided between us
that before morning prayers, I will…
I said, no divorce.
You are not understanding the point, we…
We will never meet again.
Its ok.
You ….
will be bound.
This restriction is my freedom.
You may go Ibrahim, thank you very much.
May I….
May I tell you something?
I was not going to the mosque.
And
I can’t lie…standing there.
Where are you going then, Ibrahim?
I don’t know.
She has been found.
She is sitting at her Brother’s house…
With Ibrahim.
Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Why are you doing all this?
Where would you go?
It’s my problem…
No matter where I go….I….
I am not your responsibility.
And why do you want to suffer with me?
I have to anyways.
These people can’t bear my burden.
In front of Shabbir, Brother breathes
after taking permission from him
You…you do one thing…you take care of your situation.
I will take care of my situation.
What will you do or what can you do,
don’t I know that?
Let’s go now.
Ibrahim, let’s go.
They are running away.
It’s with me.
And it will stay with me from now on.
You said that he came to drop you.
So, he is not going to the mosque.
What have you got to do with it?
I also need a shelter to stay.
This is your house; don’t you have a share in it?
You can’t fight with Shabbir.
There is nothing to fight about,
if he has divorced you then it’s over.
Things will not get over so simply
Brother, you also know this.
Things will not get over even like this, Aliya.
Ok then both of you get out of this,
it’s between me and him.
You tell us,
what is the truth, we will step aside.
Sister in law!
He is saying that the divorce never happened.
The matter is something else.
Have you told Shabbir that I am here?
Yes.
We will have to talk to him after all.
Then you go ahead and talk to him.
We will talk in front of you.
No, I have ended the matter.
We are not the neighbors, who
will sit and listen to stories.
We also have to answer the people.
And Brother I only know what answer
I have to give to my God.
Shut the door.
Sister in law!
Let me see how she leaves.
Brother!
Shut the door.
Don’t make a sound.
Don’t you have manners?
You are misbehaving with your elder brother.
Come on Brother, you also leave.
Come on.
Brother!
Sister in law….leave the door…
Listen to me.
We have to resolve the matter very wisely.
Don’t lose your temper at all.
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Because of this nature of yours,
we have reached this situation
Mother don’t lecture me at this time.
I am extremely annoyed
Listen to me…
Wisdom lies in, quietly and
calmly discussing things…
Otherwise, the mustache that
keep on twirling, will be gone too.
That’s it.
I will speak and you will stay silent, that’s it.
You will not speak at all.
Come on, get off.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Speak up…where is she?
Brother…
She has left.
She has left?
Where did she go?
How did she go?
Didn’t you stop her?
Were your hands broken?
Brother!
A man was along with her too.
She was not alone.
Come on Brother, you also leave.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Save your life, Brother.
He is coming.
Don’t you know about Shabbir?
Come on…
Come on…
Come on…
Come on…
Sister in law, where would he live,
he is not allowed in the mosque?
You stand quietly, he may go wherever he
wants to, you relax and stand here.
Sister in law, he cannot stay there.
He may stay wherever but you will stay here, that’s it.
Shabbir Brother…
Listen to your Brother, Shabbir may
leave, you will stay here.
I have a man with me.
No way.
Aliya, Aliya, Aliya, Aliya, stop, stop.
We will be badly disgraced, badly defamed.
If, not yours then at least consider our honor.
Kill me then.
Kill me, poison me.
That house is more suffocating for me than a grave.
Neither you are from the neighborhood
nor from a nearby area.
This is why I came to you.
To tell you the truth.
May the whole world curse me…
But you should know about what
happened with your sister.
But I know that you can’t bear the burden…
This is why I am removing you from the situation.
Give love to Ramsha, Sister in law.
Let’s go Ibrahim.
You should get your hands and feet broken
and start begging on the road.
God knows, what kind of a shameless Brother are you?
Brother!
Shut up!
Oho!
What’s the point in sitting home and fighting?
Go out and look for her.
She must not have gone far, she must be nearby.
What are you doing?
Mother!
Listen to me.
Mother!
Now…
Where will go?
You may go.
Where?
I don’t know where….
This is such a big world, there is a huge
crowd of people, go somewhere, hide.
I don’t know any place apart from the mosque
and the chamber.
There must be someone.
Some relative, some friend,
some old companion or mate.
How is it possible that one doesn’t have anyone?
It’s only the cleric.
God knows, what situation he must be in?
Mr. Chaudry will take out all his anger on him only.
You…
you tell me about yourself, you…
Must have thought something about yourself.
Where will you go?
There is another grave of my
Father in this city, I will go there.
Ok…
fine, then let’s go.
You will stay safe, if you will stay without me.
Please, go.
I can’t leave you alone, under the open sky.
Let me drop you to some doorstep or some shelter then I will go from there.
Come, please.
Yousuf!
Hmm.
Hey Yousuf!
Hmm.
Look over there.
Aliya?
Yes.
Aliya!
Aliya!
Father!
Father!
Yousuf Uncle, leave me.
Father!
Father!
Yousuf Uncle, I want to go with Father.
Father!
Yousuf Uncle!
Listen to me Maryam.
This time…
Its our turn, to burn in the fire.
Have to pay Yaseen’s debt.
Tea.
Oh, there was no need for this.
Its ok, have tea.
I still can’t believe it
How can she do this, Aunty?
I, myself can’t believe that boy.
He never dared to look at anyone.
He was a boy, raised in our house.
He would turn out to be so disloyal,
I could have never imagined
She never paid head to even the best of them.
I don’t know…
What did she see in this foolish man…?
And that too in the presence of a
handsome man like Shabbir.
Yes, I also kept thinking…
That he is an orphan, she must be
feeling pity and sorry for him.
Give her a divorce and set her free.
What’s the point of keeping such a woman?
Our honor is intact…
Yours….mine, everybody’s honor.
From Yaseen Brother, to your daughter.
The stain of divorce…
will mark everyone.
She will still not refrain.
The condition, I saw her in…
Oh God!
May God forgive me.
If it would have been some other woman…
She would have been shivering with fear.
She was standing so close to him in the store as well.
Anyways…
Let me ……
visit the neighbors.
I might get a clue of her.
I will be back in a short while.
Ok.
Now tell me, what is this white wire for?
It’s a cold wire.
And what about this red one?
Hot wire.
When we make a connection, which wire do we…?
Hot…
Yaseen Brother, Yaseen Brother, Yaseen Brother.
Yaseen Brother.
There has been a big trouble.
There is fire everywhere.
Do one thing, take the girl and leave quickly.
Dear, come here.
Yousuf, you listen to me.
Take Aliya along and go.
I will deal with them, don’t worry.
Are you in your senses Yaseen Brother?
Buddy, do as I ask you to do.
Dear, go with Uncle.
No,
No…No
No.
No, no.
Father!
Father!
Aliya dear!
Yousuf Uncle, leave me.
Aliya dear, come.
Father!
Father!
Yousuf Uncle, I have to go with Father.
Aliya dear, hurry up.
Father!
Yousuf Uncle, no…no.
I want to go to Father.
I want to go to Father.
Leave me, please.
I want to go to Father.
I want to go to Father.
Father pleaded a lot with them.
He begged them a lot.
But their anger did not allow
them to listen to anything.
The fire spread in midst of this turmoil…
And I saw my Father one last time in that very fire.
Burning and trembling.
It is called martyrdom.
Usman came over…
With an excuse of checking the meter.
But there is one thing…
He must be sure that you can go anywhere
but you will not come here.
Why did you guys stand up?
Sit down, my lovely daughter….
Sit down and have water at least.
I have sent Maryam.
I have asked her to find out and inquire about them.
Why are you getting worried?
Sit down, my lovely daughter
Don’t worry.
Sit down.
Have water.
Hey
Maryam Aunty, it’s you?
How come you are here after such a long time?
Both families had very good terms.
You may say that they were one family.
All the joys and sorrows were mutual.
Sweets on festivals…
Cake on the big day.
Crackers on Easter and holy festivals.
Everything was mutual.
She was very little.
She would come every second or third
day on the cycle with her Father.
At the back…
The toolbox was kept
and she would sit in the front.
Her Father used to call her junior mechanic.
Wherever Yaseen would work in the neighborhood…
The Father and daughter would come and have tea and biscuits at my place on their way back.
He used to do the church work…for free.
If anything was required,
he would bring it from his own pocket.
May be this is why God…
Gave him the status of a martyr.
When the bill is paid,
there’s no money left for food.
It seems like the neighbor’s units
are also being added into ours.
I came to show it to Usman.
One
fan…and two bulbs…
they have given us such a huge bill.
Huh?
Usman came in the neighborhood…
to check the meters.
He doesn’t visit us.
Yousuf stopped me a lot…
But I said…
They will not shut the door on me.
Isn’t it?
We have only stopped visiting but there is no conflict…
There is no enmity.
No.
You give this to me.
I will show it to Usman…when he comes.
Yes.
I swear
the inflation rate is so high,
it’s hard to manage.
It’s a big problem.
Do look after it.
Ok?
Give my love to Aliya.
I pray for her a lot.
Sure.
She needs your prayers a lot.
Ok then.
Ok.
I shall leave.
Aunty!
I have peeped into each and every house.
She is nowhere.
I don’t know where would she have gone?
I can’t understand.
Hmm.
She came to get a hint.
Aliya is indeed at her place.
Who?
Maryam Aunty?
No way.
She can’t go there.
She can do anything.
Haven’t you guys understood it by now?
You have dropped me to a shelter, now go.
Are you safe here?
I am not your responsibility, Ibrahim.
Whatever you have done for me,
it was not obligatory on you.
But I am thankful to you.
You may go now.
I am dragging myself, I can’t bear your burden along.
Look….
I talked to you about divorce
that as soon as we arrive…
There will be no divorce.
This marriage will hold Shabbir and me back.
Go.
Ok.
Yousuf!
Yousuf!
Yousuf!
Didn’t I say that there is no need to go there.
We have made them suspicious.
What has happened?
Oh! His Mother is a very sharp lady.
You may say that she is about to arrive here.
Uncle!
Usman dear.
Welcome!
I feel so good.
You have made me meet Yaseen’s
fragrance after a long time dear.
How are you?
Are you alright?
What is it? Have you started dieting?
You used to eat the others share as well.
All is well….What about you Uncle?
God has been great.
He has been great.
Aunty came over to our house with the bill.
Oh man, she is so hasty for no reason….
If she will watch TV the whole night…
The amount of the bill is bound to rise
He is Aliya’s husband.
Our…
Oh! That’s great.
Today…God has
blessed us with two joys…
Where are they?
Where are they?
Come dear, come, come.
This is your own house.
It’s no problem.
Yousuf!
What is the matter?
Usman dear, is everything alright?
Look around properly dear,
satisfy yourself completely.
Uncle, a man can hide…
But his fragrance cannot.
The whole church was filled
with the fragrance of perfume,
if you don't believe me, you may ask someone else.
Ibrahim was there.
And if Ibrahim was there…
Then Aliya was also there.
Is this lady traveling with you, Brother?
Hey Brother!
What is your relation with her?
Brother…he is my husband.
Is he your husband?
Then why are you sitting so far apart?
Get closer.
Another passenger will sit there.
Come on, come on…get up from there, come on.
Sit, sit, sit.
Come, come, come.
Come, come, sit.
Sir, make the lady passengers sit in the front.
Where is she?
Tell me.
Dear, listen to me.
Tell me, where is she?
Listen to me.
Dear, listen to me, listen to me.
Look, if the wife is upset, she doesn’t hide.
She would sit in front of you with a long face…
With her knees on her husband’s chest.
And till he doesn’t please her, she doesn’t get up from there.
No matter how upset Aliya is…
How can she come here?
She has not stepped in here,
after her Father’s martyrdom.
You keep quiet lady…keep quiet.
And you know everything.
Tell me, where is she?
Brother, wait, wait.
Let me speak.
Uncle…
You are like her Father.
How can you tolerate that she
runs away with someone else?
She has not runaway…
She has gone with her husband.
She went away with the man, she was married to.
She is my wife.
She is my wife.
Look son!
can’t help you more than keeping my mouth shut.
What you have done…
I will not tell anyone.
I can’t do anything further for you.
Aliya’s Father was martyred serving this place of worship.
So, for his daughter…
I can die.
The rest is up to you.
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me.
Maula Daad!
Oh!
Maula Daad!
Hey, Maula Daad!
Maula!
Where has he disappeared?
They have hired all the lazy people…here only.
Anita!
Hey Anita!
Anita!
Where were you?
Is this how you guard?
You left the door open and you disappeared.
I went to buy groceries for Bushra Madam.
What do you mean by Bushra Madam’s groceries?
Look…
if Anita is upstairs or has
she left early in the morning?
She must be in her room.
Then go and check her quickly.
What?
Come on, leave from here.
Bushra Madam’s groceries!
Yes, Yousuf Brother.
Yes, yes.
Is everything ok?
I have sent him.
I will inform you once he is back.
I will inform you.
Yes.
All the girls are the same.
They go to sleep with ear phones in the ears.
Whether it's a storm, a whirlwind, or an earthquake…
They remain completely unaware.
I will inform, only when I get some information.
Yes.
Yes Aunty!
Why aren’t you answering the phone?
I was sleeping. My shift ended at 6 o’clock.
I had a night shift.
Call at your home.
It’s an emergency.
They are calling repeatedly.
What?
Greetings Father, sorry, my phone was on mute mode, what’s the emergency, is Mother alright?
