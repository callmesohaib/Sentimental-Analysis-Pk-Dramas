You can’t fight with Shabbir.
There is nothing to fight about,
if he has divorced you then it’s over.
Aliya’s Father was martyred
serving this place of worship.
So, for his daughter…
I can die.
The rest is up to you.
Come on, eat it.
Aunty, you also eat something.
Should I make tea for you?
Eat it.
I think its him.
What happened?
Did you find her or not?
I will tell you, take her inside.
Uh
Ramsha dear…
Come, let me change your clothes, come.
I know, where has Aunty gone to…
Are you alright?
How are you?
Did you reach here comfortably?
It must have been very difficult for you, you don’t even have a phone.
I could have at least sent you the location.
No, it’s ok.
Greetings!
I think that…
She must have gone to Anita.
Who is Anita?
She is Uncle Yousuf’s daughter.
Where can we find her?
Will have to find out.
Then get up.
Brother,
not like this…
It will take time.
Will have to find out.
What do you mean by it will take time?
Brother, everybody keeps secrets from each other after that incident.
No one tells about anybody’s address.
I also did not go back then.
First boarding then hostel.
Mother and Father also come here to meet me.
Oh…
My shift will end at 8 o’clock…
So…we will meet here at 10 o’clock and will decide about what to do next.
Till then I will settle down Aliya in my hostel…
And you find a place here to stay.
Ok?
Where will he go?
There are many hotels in the market here,
he will find a place.
Then I will also go along with him.
Do you have the marriage certificate?
If you don’t have one, how will you stay then,
they ask for it.
He has lived in a mosque all his life, he cannot live alone, I will stay with him.
There is a mosque also nearby.
Anita, in fact, you leave it.
We will manage something for ourselves, its ok.
We will manage it.
Ibrahim, finish the tea so that we can go.
Forget it.
Leave it, let me think for a few minutes.
We will find a solution, ok?
Maula daad!
Maula daad!
There is no water.
Come.
Come….Come
Ok…
The lights will remain switched off.
Because if it remains switched on,
then anyone can come on.
My shift is about to start, I will come back by 6 o’clock…We will decide, what to do after that.
This is water, jug and there are biscuits and chips in the cupboard, ok?
Ok…
I am leaving.
Take off the veil.
What?
Take off the veil.
Hmm
Aliya Madam…
Take off my veil.
Aliya Madam!
Father, what could I have done and where would I have taken them?
I could do only this much in 15 minutes.
Her husband is also a loser, total zero.
No, no, it’s a weekend and all the girls have gone to their houses. There is no one on my floor as well.
I have decided to take an off, two or two and half hours earlier from my shift…
Come and get them out of here,
before Aunty wakes up.
Yes.
Ok, I will get them out, bye!
Come.
Come on.
Where is the plumber coming from, when he has not reached for three days?
It’s a limit, there is not a single drop of water.
I can’t climb up because of my knees.
Wait, wait, see for yourself…
Look at the condition yourself.
Why are you showing it to me?
Maula daad!
Hey Maula daad!
I have sent him to get something.
Your tasks are never ending.
You keep sending him here and there all day long.
When will he go to call for the electrician or the plumber?
He keeps roaming around for you guys.
Maula daad: Madam, I couldn’t find it, I visited two or three shops.
Its ok, its ok, no problem, I will do it.
The condition here is such…
That I can’t stay, I’m looking for another place for myself, I will not stay.
Go ahead and arrange for another place.
You guys show attitude as if you guys are living at your Mother’s place.
Yes.
Where were you?
Aaa…
Madam had sent me to get some stuff.
Keep doing these things.
Sometimes, it’s this Madam, sometimes its Bushra, sometimes its Anita, sometimes its Zubi.
Go ahead and keep working for them.
Huh
Keep roaming around for them.
Don’t you have anything else to do?
Is this how you guard?
Listen to me very carefully.
What I will tell you…
You must do that first.
Otherwise, I will beat you properly.
Go from here.
Ok, ok.
They have made me go crazy.
Oh!
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Aunty!
Shall we go inside and talk?
What are you doing?
Actually
I am performing dry ablution;
I couldn’t complete the ablution.
Well…
Do you know where the prayer mat is kept?
Ok, ok.
Oh no, no, my Sister, why are you
making me a sinner?
Don’t do this.
Stop it.
a woman’s matter is such.
One loses his worth.
I apologize on his behalf.
Please, forgive him.
I have nothing in my heart.
I have forgiven him.
May God keep you happy.
May God keep your daughter happy.
The torment we are enduring…May God never put you through such a torment.
Aunty…
I can’t see Anita around…
Where is she these days?
Actually…
Dear…she is sometimes here,
sometimes somewhere else.
Neither she stays in one place nor
does she stick to one job.
We are very worried about her.
This is the problem Aunty…
When a girl loses her mind…
She belongs to nowhere then.
Neither here nor there.
We are also mourning about the same.
I can’t understand that what spell has that unfortunate casted?
What has he done to her?
The girl is not in her senses, she has gone crazy.
Neither any shame, nor any dignity.
Neither any regard,
nor any sense of sin or virtue,
she doesn’t remember anything.
Look at my son…
Look at him.
Is he mad?
Has he lost his mind?
Why would he divorce a good and decent wife?
Tell me.
And brother…
There is no concept of divorce in our family.
We deal with the woman in a strict manner
Just once…
I left home without permission just once…
His Father had tied my legs.
Look…
You people…
If, you can do something… Then
help us.
Its about our family’s honor.
Brother look…
It’s a matter of Brother Yaseen’s honor.
Despite her shamelessness, my son is ready to keep her, he will forgive her.
Look…
For his martyrdom’s sake.
Save his honor.
Mother, leave it.
Keep quiet!
I will be grateful.
What did you get, Mother?
After getting yourself humiliated and me insulted….
Did you get anything else besides shame and disgrace?
I didn’t feel this low and disgraced even then…
When he looked into my eye and told me that
Aliya is not my wife….
Mine?
Why didn’t I shoot him?
Why didn’t I shoot him?
Why didn’t I shoot him?
Mother, I am going to shoot myself,
if you utter such a thing again.
I am not so low…
That she would fall for someone living off my scraps.
I have divorced her…Chaudry Shabbir
has divorced her.
She was begging and imploring
She was even ready to become a housemaid…
I will keep her as a housemaid…
I will make her feel worthless.
Worthless!
Oh no man!
I told you…
Whatever Aunty has to throw away…
She takes it out of the fridge and gives it to others.
The same happened with Rabia and Arishmal.
They kept going to the washroom for two days.
I was also wondering that a woman who doesn’t give anything for free…
She is distributing beef patties?
And that too with a smile.
I ate it because of you, buddy.
Bushra buddy, come out.
I am in a very bad state.
Bushra!
Bushra!
Is it you?
Bushra!
Hello! This is Anita Yousuf, how can I help you?
May I now your name to address you?
Would you like to hold please?
Can you please tell me where you are right now, try your ATM card again a
nd tell me what is written on the screen?
Would you like to hold on once again?
Greetings!
Crimes are happening here.
People are being retrieved from the washrooms.
And you are having breakfast over there with free loader retired officers.
Come quick.
They have made me go crazy.
My knee ache, God knows…
I will deal with you later.
You are the culprit.
What is wrong with this fan?
Once you are done with these tasks…
Only then you can get these taps and fans fixed.
Sister, I have asked Younus brother…
He is delaying it every day.
I have tried it myself…
I got a serious shock.
I will get someone tomorrow…
Dear, you will go to the jail tomorrow, dear….
You will see.
Sister,
I swear upon God, I don’t know, how they have got in.
They have dropped from the rooftop?
She is a very good mechanic.
Maryam!
Maryam!
Yes.
What is it?
It’s Madam Bilqees’s call from the hostel.
Answer it then.
Look, what she has to say.
Answer it.
Greetings Madam!
Do you know Aliya and Ibrahim?
Yes, of course.
What is your relation with them and who are they?
You may say, she is my daughter.
Ibrahim is her husband.
We have a five-year-old relationship….
I am sure that you must not be lying to us.
No, no, Madam, why would I lie?
Is everything ok?
No, nothing is ok.
Your daughter has broken my hostel rules.
All of you will have to bear the punishment for this.
So…
What happened?
Tell me.
They have been caught.
Oh…
I don’t even pass by this mean man.
But I had to fall into his clutches today.
Ok listen.
Don’t make any more mistakes.
Whatever I am telling you…You will say that only.
You both have come here in search of work.
Someone fed you something on your way and you both got unconscious…
He stole everything and left…
ID card, money, clothes, everything.
Ok?
Sir!
Sir, there had been an emergency.
Sorry, Sir.
Sorry, Sir.
Seems like, I have lost my job too.
What have you decided then?
What should be done to them?
Expel this girl from the hostel…
And file a report against both of them.
Hmm.
This is justified.
If tomorrow she brings someone
else with a veil here…
Who will send girls to this hostel then?
Uncle, please.
I will apologize, will beg…If you want, I will even rub my nose in front of everyone.
But please…Don’t do this.
No.
Rules are rules.
Ok.
I am ok….If you want to expel me, go ahead.
But please, spare them, it’s not their fault.
People trust us and send their girls to this hostel…
And because of people like you…
We should ruin our reputation?
Uncle, do you know, I am about to lose my job even.
When Aunty called, I left the customer on hold there…
And the company has taken a serious
notice against this.
They should have taken the notice.
Uncle, please…
Aunty…
I have been living here for the past five years, please.
You guys sit outside.
Let me do something.
Maula daad!
No one should go out of the gate.
Madam, you were not fair.
If, I lose my job then you will be responsible for that.
What do you say then?
Give it a thought.
That girl is skilled in all kinds of tasks.
Electrician,
plumbing, woodwork, cooking, cleaning, moping…Everything.
And that boy must also be skilled to some extent.
If nothing, then he can be a guard.
Farooq!
If, a single electrical or plumbering task has to be done…
One has to beg the mechanics.
One has to plead them.
Even to tighten a single screw…None of them charge less than 500.
And the sweeper, if I instruct him a little, he starts giving looks.
And that maid…She shows attitude over everything.
And that Watchman…You know about him.
I will get the work of five to six people done by this husband and wife.
You will see.
Neither do they have an address,
nor any identity, no guarantees.
Yousuf Maseeh is there for the address and identities.
As far as the guarantee is concerned…
It’s his daughter.
It’s a five-year-old relationship.
One gets to know someone in such a long time.
Hmm?
Okay
Listen!
Aliya Madam!
I have an idea.
If …
If the police come now…
Tell the police that you don’t know me…
And you have no relation with me.
And this way,
they will talk to me about everything that concerns you, you will be safe.
I will deal with it.
Hmm?
I, Anita Yousuf, daughter of Yousuf Maseeh…
Solemnly, declare that Mohammad Ibrahim, son of Mohammad Ilyas…
And Aliya Yaseen, daughter of Miyan Mohammad Yaseen, are husband and wife.
And I guarantee that in Madam Bilqees hostel for women…
They will display good behavior and exemplary conduct.
Furthermore, I take full responsibility for any damage, theft, fraud, or deceit during their stay…
And will compensate for any losses incurred in this regard.
Otherwise, legal action of any kind may be taken against me.
Signature, Anita Yousuf, daughter of Yousuf Maseeh.
I already drank some.
Blow it.
I have given your guarantee as well.
And….Don’t leave this gate next time.
Ibrahim will do the outside work.
May God keep you happy Madam.
Buddy, when I saw at night, no I got scared.
Why did you get scared?
I did not know.
Quiet!
Are all the girls present?
Yes Ma’am!
I can’t see Aiman and Fauzia.
They refused and have gone out.
Hmm.
Two days back, whatever happened in this hostel…
You guys must have told that to each other adding more spice to it.
Yes Sir.
Stop all this.
What is this nonsense?
Give it to me.
Their social media never ends.
Whatever Anita did…
If, anyone of you wants to do that then go ahead and fulfill your desire.
But what a heavy price Anita had to pay, listen to that…
This ….
apology letter…
10,000 rupees fine…
Which Anita has gone to submit.
Apart from this…
For one month…
They both ….
will work for free in this hostel.
Cleaning and mopping,
kitchen,
laundry
and groceries.
Apart from this…
Whatever this office
orders them…
They will have to fulfill it.
This was the first incident of this hostel…
That’s why they were dealt leniently.
Cleaning and mopping apart…
I will make you guys clean the floor with your nose.
Do you guys get it?
Yes Sir.
You may go.
Ok Sir.
I think, you guys must also have understood it.
Go now…
and get started.
Come on, Good! Good!
The customer is on hold for fifteen hours.
I tried to convince a lot saying,
please, hang up…
He says, no…
He will hang up only when the person who asked him to hold, will say it.
Sorry Sir, there was a very big emergency.
I hope the patient will survive.
Yes, Sir, I hope.
Uh…
Should I consider myself unemployed?
You will not be dealt leniently next time.
Thank you, Sir.
Sorry Sir, it will not happen again.
Thank you!
I pray to God…
That there is good news.
Good news will not come from my side Cleric Sir, it will come from your side.
There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.
My patience is running out, Cleric Sir.
Before, I hire a hitman to finish him off
Give it another try.
Mr. Chaudry…
Tell me honestly…
What can I do?
You…
can file a theft report against him.
Honorable, Mr. SHO…
Murshidabad police station, district Rangpura.
It is requested that I have been serving as the leader of the Shaam Nagar mosque for a long time…
For the upkeep, cleanliness, and five times call to prayer…
A person, Mohammad Ibrahim, son of Mohammad Ilyas, is assigned.
For all the mosque’s expenses, a donation box has been placed.
Is it ok?
It is ok.
From which approximately, 25 to 30 thousand, is recovered monthly.
The entire charity amount along with Mohammad Ibrahim, have been missing for the last five days.
Therefore, I request that you immediately arrest the above mentioned accused and recover the amount.
Mosque leader, Rangpura.
Cleric, Ghulam Rasool.
Sign it, Cleric Sir.
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty, Anita!
Bilqees Aunty!
What happened?
What happened? Why are you crying?
Why are you crying so bitterly?
Tell me why are you crying? Why are you getting distressed?
Aunty, Ibrahim has left.
