I have come to ask about Ibrahim, why have you arrested him?
What is your relation with him?
He is my husband.
According to our information, he is unmarried.
What’s his crime?
Aliya!
Aliya, I beg of you.
Shabbir!
I beg you.
For God’s sake, forgive me, I have made a very big mistake.
Shabbir, someone is coming.
Sit up.
I will be thankful to you.
Shabbir, sit on the chair.
I made a very big mistake, forgive me.
Ok, sit on the chair.
Sit on the chair.
Come, let’s go home.
Come, please, let’s go home.
I will not go without Ibrahim.
I know…
You are protecting that beggar from me.
I can understand.
I forgot about that matter, I forgave him, leave it.
I have found you, what else do I need?
Just…
don’t go beyond that Aliya.
There is destruction beyond that, there is no way back.
You and that beggar are a noose around my neck, you will ruin everything.
You…
You…
wanted to live like a maid in the house, right?
To hell with that.
You continue living like the lady of the house.
No Shabbir, I have not come for you, Shabbir!
You just come home.
Shabbir, I have come for Ibrahim.
Shabbir, leave my hand.
I don’t want anyone other than Ibrahim.
I just want Ibrahim.
What is your relation with him?
Hmm?
What is your relation with him?
Is this you asking me?
Don’t you know my relation with him?
I have folded my hands before you, apologized to you.
For God’s sake forgive me.
Don’t torture me any further.
And it won't be just me asking; everyone will ask you, what proof do you have?
Are you done reading?
And the proof of the divorce…
Anita must have sent you its video.
Oh!
Are you…
Involved with Chaudry Zubair in this conspiracy?
Tell me?
Yes, it’s my conspiracy.
I am doing all this.
First, I got myself divorced…
Then I got married to Ibrahim forcefully.
Now, I am provoking you with this proof of marriage and divorce.
You are not getting it.
You are not getting what Chaudry Zubair is doing with us.
What big game is he playing.
He is making you stand against me so that we both get destroyed.
No one will get anything from this…
Except for humiliation, we will get nothing.
I have got what I wanted.
Now, you deal with your own matters.
Great!
Mother was right.
Seems like that beggar has casted a spell on you.
You are even talking like him.
Yes, he has casted a spell on me.
He has really casted a spell on me, Shabbir.
And I will not come out of his spell now.
Wow! Great!
Very good!
You have chosen a very good place.
Its great pleasure.
I met my ex-girlfriend right here for the first time.
Get up, you have a visitor.
Ibrahim!
Are you ok?
Are you ok?
I hope no one has harmed you.
Why have you come?
Tell me, if someone has harmed you.
You should not have come here Aliya Madam.
You…
I hope no one has misbehaved with you.
First answer me…Has someone harmed you?
You should not have had come here.
Please, answer me, has someone harmed you or not?
Shabbir…
Did he raise his hand on you?
He is going crazy for you.
You should not have had come, if he sees you, he will kidnap you.
He is not that daring.
Aliya Madam!
For God’s sake, go from here, this place is not suitable for you.
Where should I go?
How should I go?
I will not go without you.
I will come back, I can understand the ways now.
This is not a mosque from where you will come back to me.
Do you always have to have it your way?
No.
I am agreeing with you.
You can’t live without me, right?
You can’t live without me at all, right?
Aliya Madam, I can.
I can even bear the distance…
For the sake of your respect and honor.
You go from here.
This is our fight.
We will fight it together.
Mr. Chaudhry, are you aware that till date…
What have I held a grudge against you?
For the slap…
Which Senior Mr. Chaudry gave me.
My ball spilled the tea on the table.
Lick it!
Lick this!
Senior Mr. Chaudry said this.
You were riding your cycle nearby.
Today…
After so many years…
I am ready to lick that same tea.
Just don’t give me another slap.
I will declare my inclusion in your party along with all my party members.
Without any condition…
You in the forefront…
And I will follow you.
I will raise slogans in your name as well.
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
So…
Is the meeting over?
Huh?
See, we have kept him with great love up till now.
Tea, refreshment, food…
You may ask him.
Yes, thank you!
Untie his hands, he will not run away.
Where will he run to?
And as long as he is sitting here…
You also are not going anywhere.
I am joking.
I will talk to Chaudry Zubair’s wife…
She will definitely take her complaint back.
There is no need to go anywhere.
There is no need for any reference.
We are already releasing him tomorrow.
There is just a minor paper work left.
And we will get the handcuffs unlocked too.
Mudassir!
Unlock Mr. Ibrahim’s hand cuffs buddy.
And get his face washed.
Don’t worry…its just a matter of tonight.
We will release him.
Wow!
You both are looking very good together.
Make some Tik tok.
Ok?
Come on, go out.
And shut the door.
And listen, no one should come in.
Come on, both of you, sit here.
Didn’t you hear me?
Come and sit here.
Yes…
Remove this, please.
Madam, remove this, hurry up, we don’t have that much time.
Why are you making a video?
I can even file a case against you under Hudood Ordinance.
Do you know what is Hudood Ordinance?
Are you aware of it?
Illegitimate relationships.
Speak cautiously, Sir!
She is my wife.
Stop talking rubbish.
I know whose wife is she.
Shabbir has divorced me.
Really?
I swear upon God.
Why?
Why has he divorced you?
Because of Chaudry Zubair.
So, you have ties with Chaudry Zubair too.
Sir, I said…
Be careful when you speak, she is my wife.
I had no relations with him.
I have a relation with his wife.
She is my friend.
I went to her house one day…
Tell the truth Madam, don’t make stories.
I am telling you the truth, Sir.
You want me to beat him up in front of you, right?
Bring the Holy Book, if you have, I can take an oath on that.
The truth is that he used to visit Chaudry Shabbir.
There you both started an affair…
And he ran away with you.
No.
The truth is that Shabbir himself has got me married to him.
Why would he get his wife married to someone, do you think we are fools?
For the sake of remarrying.
Now he wants me to take a divorce from him and remarry him.
Ok!
So, this is the story.
It’s a great mess.
It’s a very interesting story.
Ok, narrate this story then.
Shabbir should be narrating this story.
If you will narrate it…
Then he will also narrate.
I will not narrate like this.
Really?
How will you narrate then?
Tell me.
Sir, Shabbir divorced me due to his enmity with Zubair.
Now Zubair wants to use this divorce against Shabbir in enmity.
What is my fault in all this?
Why am I suffering in their politics?
If you think that Shabbir can gain a few extra votes by exposing me, then its ok.
Make my video.
Show my helplessness to the world.
Yes, whatever goods that boy has stolen…
Shabbir will compensate for that loss.
Yes…I take my complaint back.
Let him go, set him free.
Let’s discuss the rest, when we meet.
Thanks a lot.
Whatever trouble you both have been through…
I apologize for that.
No problem, Sir.
It’s not your fault.
This is their politics.
Whoever is in authority…
He humiliates the other publicly.
At the moment, I think…
At the moment, I think…
They have joined each other.
And this is more dangerous for both of you.
Shabbir has got the freedom and…
He can do anything.
Now, it’s very dangerous for both of you to live there.
My men have seen that place and…
Anyone of them will reveal it before him.
The car is ready, Sir.
OK.
Mudassir will get you a bus.
Take care of yourselves beyond that.
I have to visit a check post.
I shall leave.
Thank you, thanks a lot.
And yes…
Ibrahim…
You sing very well buddy.
Keep singing.
Aliya Madam!
We are not going to the hostel.
We will have to go once at least.
We will get our luggage from there and then move ahead.
For how long will we run like this?
I am tired.
I also want to lead a life without embarrassment and fear, holding your hand.
That’s true but there is no other way out.
There is.
Let’s stand before them.
If we will run like this secretly, they will twist this matter into something else, you know that, right?
You can understand this, right?
Hmm, I do understand but I don’t care at all.
I do care this time.
Ibrahim, he will kill you.
Let him kill me, I don’t care, there is nothing more important for me than your honor.
I don’t know, what are you talking about, let’s go…
Aliya Madam, I have agreed with everything you have said without asking any questions.
This time, you will listen to me.
We will go to the mosque to Cleric Sir.
Trust me.
My Dear Son!
You should take it…
As there was some divine purpose behind this.
He had to end your enmity like this only.
And women are not a problem.
They keep coming and going in men’s lives…
Like a shoe.
If a shoe starts hurting, one can change it.
And if you like…
You can keep even two and three.
When your own shoe hits on your head, Mother…
It hurts a lot.
You did not see her eyes.
That beggar was shining in them.
She was talking like him.
Forget her.
She deserved it.
She was worth that beggar only.
It was you who picked her from the ground and made her sit on the throne.
Did she deserve it?
Neither was she pretty or beautiful, nor she held any character.
Now you see…
The kind of a girl I will bring for you.
Let me burry her first.
I have already buried her, I have totally buried her.
I will spread the news of her being infertile all around…
I will make sure, everyone gets to know about.
And that boy…
He will get lost along with the charity box.
Do you know…
No one even curses the Muezzin, if he turns out to be a thief.
Why have you come here?
To leave honorably.
Because I ran away earlier.
Who will bring your wedding procession?
You.
You will bring it, right?
Get out from here.
Leave, I am telling you.
Before Shabbir’s anger burn you to ashes, run away from here.
We will not leave.
Ask Mr. Chaudry…
To announce the divorce after the night prayers.
Such a bold statement…
Doesn’t suit coming from someone like you.
Mother, it is not about me.
It is God and his Prophet’s saying.
OK.
Should I also distribute sweets for your marriage after this?
That’s our personal matter, we will deal with that.
Stop talking rubbish.
Both of you leave from here quietly.
I am giving you this much privilege, consider this enough.
We will leave, once the divorce is announced.
You wanted this traitor, right?
Ye got him out of the lock up and handed him over to you.
He surrendered his politics to his enemy… to Chaudry Zubair.
Oh, you fool, think about his prestige a little.
I am regarding his prestige.
This is why I want him to announce the divorce himself.
He will be badly insulted, if I announce it.
He will be left with nothing.
So, Chaudry Shabbir!
Is everything alright?
I hope you have not changed your mind.
No, Mr. Chaudry.
I have actually come to lick tha table today, on which I had once spilled tea.
Huh!
What are you saying?
You don’t believe verbal statements otherwise.
Why did you feel so?
You set both of them free from the police station and settled them in the mosque.
Mosque?
She is asking me to announce it.
Before all the worshippers in the mosque.
So, do you cook food yourself now?
Yes, dear…
Since you guys have left…
I somehow manage to cook on my own.
Have they stopped sending you food as well?
No, dear
I have stopped it myself.
Why?
A leader of the mosque should do it on his own.
So that someone else’s favor…
Does not become a reason of hinderance in speaking the truth.
How do you earn?
I have started doing a job at a place after morning till evening prayers.
I look after the administration there.
I also have learnt a lot from her.
I can cook vegetables.
God bless!
He has learnt cooking but he has not yet learnt to eat.
He takes it from others share as well.
Especially, when there is sweet dish.
Especially, carrot pudding.
Greetings Madam!
They being together in the mosque…
Is a big question within itself.
Even if they don’t say anything to anyone.
You will have to prepare an answer for it.
A stinging reply.
I mean, your narrative.
I hope you understand the meaning of narrative.
A fabricated story.
A tale so big and powerful…
That it leaves all the other stories in silence.
Yes, Bunty.
What are you doing in the mosque?
I am about to cook at the moment, why?
Have you gone mad?
Get out of there.
They both are sitting here together.
God knows, what will they do with you?
What will they do?
Shabbir’s anger…and Zubair’s conspiracy…
If they get together, what could happen?
Think about it yourself.
Bunty, I have left everything over to God.
I am sitting in His house.
Whether its honor or disgrace…it’s up to Him.
Go Noora!
What did he say?
He has dug a grave.
One of us has to get buried.
Either me or Aliya.
The decision is yours.
Why are you guys so astonished?
No.
Don’t get astonished.
Brothers do fight with each other.
Sometimes over wealth, sometimes property, sometimes politics.
But self-respect is mutual for brothers.
This shamelessness…
Is even a disgusting disease then corona.
Once, it starts spreading, it keeps spreading.
From one person to another…
From one house to another house…
It keeps spreading, it keeps spreading.
What I have come here to talk about…
Though it is very serious and bitter.
Imagine, it’s so bitter and serious…
That these two young men…
Who raise slogans in rallies and processions…
Even they can’t say it.
They have brought me…
Saying that Mother you talk about it.
So, be courageous now.
And listen!
This mosque of yours…
Where you and us, offer prayers five times a day…
Where we cry and bow down before God, ask for forgiveness…
Today, shamelessness has taken refuge in that mosque.
We…
We had considered it a relationship as of a Sister in law and a Brother in law.
I swear, we had never even doubted.
I have seen it myself.
But I did not tell anything to my Shabbir.
I said, no…
He is very aggressive by nature, he will ruin everything.
Yes…
I explained it to my Daughter in law.
I put strict restrictions on her.
But all in vain.
It is said that…
When one becomes shameless…
When one loses all sense of decency…
Then one becomes blind.
No restriction could stop her.
She jumped over all restriction and ran away with him.
Yours, mine, charity…she ran away with all of it.
The girl was illiterate…
She was uneducated, we could say that but…
The boy…
Imagine, he was so religious, a prayer caller.
Neither could he see the Holy Book, nor the religious laws.
He went blind due to shamelessness.
And not only this…
This is not enough, look at this.
He got married to her, got married.
You have changed so much.
I am amazed when I look at you.
This is not the same Ibrahim.
This is all thanks to your brilliance.
The fear of losing someone makes one weak…
And brave too.
I had nothing.
Ever since I have found you…
I have started feeling more respectable in myself.
This is why neither did I feel nervous in the police station…
Nor did my tongue tremble before Mother.
Anything can happen.
I am aware of Shabbir’s temperament.
He can go to any extent.
Don’t you worry.
I will not let any harm come to you.
I will die myself, but I will not let any harm come to you.
Why do you think of me apart from yourself?
If we are to live, we will live together…
If we are to die, we will die together.
I am helpless.
I can’t think of your death…
Even if it’s with me.
Stop it! Stop it!
Put an end to this shamelessness!
Stop it! Stop it!
Put an end to this shamelessness!
Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
Restore! Restore!
Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
Restore! Restore!
Bring them out!
Bring the shameless out!
Bring them out!
Bring the shameless out!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop the indecency!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop the indecency!
Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
Restore! Restore!
Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
Restore! Restore!
Please, show respect for the mosque’s sanctity.
It’s the sanctity that we have come to restore, Cleric Sir.
For 25 years…
I have been watching over this mosque.
And you…
have become the watchmen in just a single day.
Shameless and immoral people have come here, Cleric Sir.
You have come here to tell this to me?
These two have entered into a marriage upon marriage, Cleric Sir.
They deserve to die.
Yes, Cleric Sir.
Who are you to decide?
This is our mutual decision.
Look at their deeds, Cleric Sir.
They have entered into a marriage upon marriage.
Wait!
Wait!
If they have committed a major sin…
Then I will be the first on to throw a stone at them.
First…A court will be set.
But…
before that…
Any step…
Is illegal…and UnIslamic.
Found them, found them.
Found the culprits.
Found the culprits.
Found the culprits, found the culprits, found them.
Found the culprits, found them.
Found the culprits, found them.
Move back! Move back!
Move back! Move back!
Move!
Move!
Leave them!
The court will decide about them, move back.
Move back!
Move back!
I swear upon the Holy Book…
Which is the guide and the light.
I swear by the prostrations taking place in this mosque…
Aliya and Ibrahim’s marriage…
Was conducted in this place of prostration.
I am the officiant of this marriage myself…
And among the witnesses were…
Chaudry Shabbir and her honorable Mother…Herself.
On January 13, 2024…
In a state of anger…
Chaudhry Shabbir to his wife, Lady Aliya…
With his political opponent…
Chaudhry Zubair Ahmad’s wife…
Due to their friendship…
Divorced her.
Chaudry Shabbir…
Was guilty on his act…
And…on 24th April, 2024…
After completing the waiting period…
Lady Aliya and Ibrahim’s were married in the same mosque…
Before Chaudry Shabbir.
The reason was…that Ibrahim…
After getting married…
Divorces his wife, Aliya…
Will pave the way for Chaudry Shabbir for remarriage.
Listen carefully!
Listen carefully!
Any marriage…
Or a divorce after that…
Is done with the intention of remarrying…
Then according to the teachings of God, and his Prophet, Peace be upon him…
Is an undesirable deed.
Therefore, Ibrahim and Aliya…
Both refused to it.
And due to Chaudry Shabbir’s rage and anger…
And fear of his power and authority…
They disappeared.
And today…
Approximately after 2 months…
For his marriage…
And
announcement of the divorce…
Which is exactly according to the Islamic laws…
Came and settled in the mosque.
And put forward their demand to Chaudry Shabbir.
But Chaudry Shabbir…
Prioritized his honor over the religious laws.
And by providing false statements to all of you…
Provoked all of you.
Now whoever…
Doubts my truthfulness…
Or he thinks…
That I used false statements from the sacred pulpit…
Then they may stone this sacred bond.
Whoever thinks…
That I have…led you with honesty…
Give you teachings of justice and truth…
They may go to Chaudry Shabbir…
And question him about his false statements.
Surely, I am also equally a part of this sin.
And I am ready for the punishment.
This is why…
For disrespecting the mosque…
The first punishment…
Should be given to me.
