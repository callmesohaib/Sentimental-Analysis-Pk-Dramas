God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
Aliya!
Aliya!
Aliya!
Leave all this.
It’s getting late, hurry up.
Leave it, I am talking to you Aliya.
Don’t look at me like this.
My heart sinks.
Get up, let’s go.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Let’s go.
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Forgive me Sir, it slipped by mistake,
I was just a little…
I don’t know how it slipped from my hand, it slipped…
I will just go and refill it.
Apologies, I will refill it, Sir.
I am very scared Sir.
My heart is feeling very anxious.
I can’t figure out anything.
Don’t get nervous dear.
He will fix everything.
You go…
Change your clothes.
Tidy up your room.
Is there no other way out?
Shabbir!
You should have taken her to the parlor.
Nothing should have been missing.
She was sitting like a living dead.
I took her from the kitchen to the dressing table.
It was necessary Shabbir.
Don’t increase my suffering any further Mother.
Don’t do this.
The suffering is mutual.
All of us have to bear it.
Madam Aliya…
Daughter of…
Mohammad Yaseen.
Mohammad Yaseen.
Do you accept this marriage…
Against a dowry amount of…
Ten thousand rupees Pakistani….
With...
Mohammad Ibrahim…
Son of, Mohammad Riaz…
Do you accept?
Yes, she does.
Aliya!
Aliya!
I do.
He does.
A woman has to make a lot of
sacrifices to save her house.
Tonight…
Will be like doomsday for Shabbir…
And for me too.
Just…
Just…
Spend this single night…
Then tomorrow it will be you…
And your heaven.
Shabbir!
Ibrahim!
After morning prayers.
Hey!
What has happened to you?
Hey!
Get up!
Get up from here, don’t create a scene, get up.
Enough my son, get up.
Get up, come on, let’s go home.
Come on, get up.
Get up, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
Hurry up dear.
Time is short.
It’s going to be dawn in a while.
I am here to give the dower amount.
She should be at my home before morning prayers.
Great injustice has been done, Mother.
Great injustice has been done, Mother.
I have…
My own Aliya…
I gave the dower amount to my Aliya, Mother.
Mother!
Stop it, stop it,
stop it my son.
I went to give the dower amount, Mother.
Mother: Stop it, stop it my son, enough!
How will I meet…?
My parents…
My siblings…
My friends…
My Grandmother.
Obviously, they all will go to heaven.
I will go to hell.
Brother did wrong.
He was very unfair to me.
I tried to explain him that it is wrong,
It is a lie…
It’s a theft.
It’s a joke with the followers of God.
But he did not agree.
Now, I am the one who will suffer the punishment.
I am the one, who will go to hell.
All my good deeds are wasted.
All my efforts have turned to dust.
These prayers and calls to prayers
will be returned to me.
Do you know…
For the last fifteen years, every day…
I have swept the mosque…
Have washed the Religious scholar’s feet…
Have fixed people’s shoes, for what, so that I may go to heaven, to meet my loved ones,
who were martyred in the earthquake.
Only I escaped.
For this misfortune?
The sad part is that…
The Religious scholar also did not listen to me
He restricted me.
How could I ignore his command?
He has brought me up like a Father.
I tried to run away from there…
To save myself from this sin but I couldn’t.
Where would have I gone?
I don’t know any place other than the mosque and this neighborhood…
And even if I had been courageous enough and left…
Then how the Religious scholar
would have had survived?
We are supposedly in the house of God, but at the mercy of His people.
I am destroyed.
My life is ruined.
I am destroyed.
How am I going to face?
Ibrahim, shut the door.
Shut the door.
Shut the door.
The light too.
What?
Aa…
Look, I had told the Religious scholar that I can only get married and I can’t go beyond that.
I respect you a lot… You are a very good person but…
We shouldn’t go beyond this.
God’s severe punishment will befall us anyways, for this grave sin we have committed.
We should not go beyond this.
I don’t want to be cursed by God anymore.
Aaaa…
Neither will I be able to meet my parents, nor…
Aaa….
Do you know since when have you been my bride?
Do you remember sister Waheeda’s wedding?
You…back then…were in class 9th then,
I guess, right?
Which song did you give a dance performance on?
Hey boy! Hey boy, leave my stole…
Isn’t it?
You acted like a boy and danced with a girl.
Give me water.
I told Mother that very day…
That I will get married to you only,
give me water, give me water.
Your brother had created quite a fuss.
He said that it was his late Father’s wish that our Aliya becomes an engineer.
Don’t worry.
Hmm.
Its ok.
Hold it, hold it.
I will fulfill your Father’s wish.
You will give the exams sitting on this bed only.
After all, you are Chaudry Shabbir’s wife.
You are not an ordinary girl, isn’t it?
Oho!
Forget it Shabbir, it’s a little tight.
No problem, it will fit.
It is slightly stuck…That’s all
Oh my God!
He must have got it made himself…
That’s why the size is a little small, especially for you.
Oh my God! That naughty has got his
name engraved too.
I did not notice.
It must have struck his mind.
If something strikes his mind…
Then…
Regardless of what happens in the world…
He has to fulfill his will.
Oh my God, what are you doing?
Aunty, the engraved letters are hurting.
Oh, no problem dear.
It’s a little hard in the beginning then
one becomes habitual.
Its ok, its ok.
Have some biscuits.
Shabbir is also the same.
He is very nice.
He is just a little strict.
Have some tea.
Leave it, have tea.
You don’t worry Sir.
Birds never perch on a tree, which is
brought in from outside.
They also have brought Shabbir from outside and made him join politics …
The ones whom Shabbir used to oblige.
Otherwise, no one from his family knew anything about politics.
Great Grandfather was a sergeant in army…
Grandfather was a clerk in railways…
His Father was a schoolteacher and
he,himself is illiterate.
Yes, yes.
He used to roam on the streets aimlessly.
This is why his politics starts from the streets…
And ends there.
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Your brother, my brother…
Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
Your brother, my brother…
Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Hello mr. Sho.
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Chaudry Zubair!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Move back.
Hey! Move back!
Hey! Move back!
I hope you were not hurt.
It’s a routine.
Why do you become so angry?
Anger is my weapon.
It’s a very dangerous weapon.
One sometimes injures himself too.
Its fine with me.
But nothing should happen to you, my love.
If something happens to you…
I will not tolerate.
Shabbir!
Be ready for every situation.
You are a politician’s wife.
Yes, Mother.
Chaudry Zubair is here to meet you.
Leader!
No matter what…
Mr. Chaudry has the style.
Congratulations on your wedding.
I have heard that we have become Brother in laws.
You have married my wife’s friend.
Seems like I have changed a lot, Mr. Chaudry.
But she is still the same.
Just like Kareem brother’s savory snack.
One falls in love in a single glance.
Bunty, greetings!
How are you?
I am absolutely fine.
There you go.
The friends have reunited.
Wow Aalo!
Your husband is crazy about you.
He has filled the entire room with photographs.
Bubbly shared your picture in the group.
I saw you there.
Where did she get it from?
There you go.
Photographs are not available
in the albums only these days.
Where is Bubbly?
She did not meet me after school.
She must have got married in the
Chaudry family like me.
Since she got married to Zubair’s cousin.
Don’t tell me.
Seriously?
I swear.
She danced so well in my wedding,
she danced so well…
That the boy from my in-laws…
Went crazy for her.
She must have become fat like you too.
Loaded with jewelry, Mrs. Chaudry.
You also will become like that…
When your husband will get a ministry.
Come on, have some tea.
Why are you so rude?
You are always raging with anger.
What are you angry about?
All thanks to you, Mr. Chaudry.
It’s all your love.
I am just returning what I had collected.
Things might have gotten a little messed up.
I don’t remember anything.
I remember everything.
I have even set an alarm in my watch.
Morning, afternoon, evening…
Even if I forget…
It rings up.
Engage in politics…
Don’t make enemies.
You are new in this game.
We have been doing this since four generations.
The old stuff is not getting sold, Mr. Chaudry.
That’s why you are sitting here.
I have just brought my wife to meet
her friend, that’s it.
That’s it.
You won the move here.
I do politics on my own.
I don’t use my wife for my politics.
Aah!
Then you will keep getting beaten up…
While showing off like this.
I will wait.
You have to come.
God willing.
You also do come.
And do send her to my place.
Ok?
Bye!
Bye!
I get beaten up by her husband…
And you are seeing her off happily.
I am talking to you.
Shabbir!
You don’t interfere, it’s a husband
and wife personal matter.
If it’s between the husband and wife
then it should stay inside…
Your voice can be heard outside.
Hey, are you deaf or have you lost your tongue?
Shabbir…
You know that it’s not my fault.
Why are you doing this?
And don’t bring this politics at home,
I’ll be grateful, please.
You listen to me.
When I am talking to you, you have to listen to me.
Shabbir!
And you will answer that too, do you get it?
Shabbir its hurting.
Shabbir!
What have I done? Why are you humiliating me?
The wounds you were trying to heal, you have rubbed salt on them, this is what you have done.
What would I have had done then?
How should I have seen off the guests?
How should you have had seen them off?
You should have seen her off like this.
If you would have had kicked her out of the house…
Only then I would have known that you feel my pain.
From today onwards, if she steps in this house…
I will not throw you on this bed…
I will kick you out of this house.
We used to play cricket in Chaudry Zubair’s street.
One day, I hit a six and the ball went
straight into their bungalow.
Now who would go to bring the ball…?
Except Chaudry Shabbir.
So, I went inside the bungalow confidently.
The ball had…
Spilled the tea, from the cup placed on the table.
Lick it.
Lick it.
Lick it.
Zubair’s Father, Chaudry Sohail said.
Gave me a tight slap on my face.
1…
Shabbir!
2…
Sshhh…
3…
4…
These slaps still hurt my face.
He got me beaten up by his servants...
And kicked me out of the bungalow…
And that too empty handed.
He is insulting me till date.
He turned my victory into defeat in the elections.
Oh!
He has humiliated and disgraced me.
Show some more for him, brother.
You are doing shopping.
Greetings!
I hope, I have not caught you.
What?
Who is this handsome?
He is Shabbir’s brother.
Where did Shabbir’s brother come from?
He is a foster brother.
He is muezzin in the mosque nearby our house.
What are you here for?
Wait!
I hope its not tight on your foot.
Stand up and show me.
Is it ok?
Sit down…Ibrahim
Show him another shoe.
Listen!
Hmm
Your husband is sealing his own fate.
Bunty, what rubbish?
Listen brother…
Hold this.
You keep sitting here with this stuff.
Madam is just coming, ok?
Where?
I have to talk about something important.
Let’s go.
Ibrahim…stay here
Let’s go.
Where?
It will taste just like Kareem brother’s snacks…
The one who used to have a stall outside our school.
Was this your important thing?
So, what?
Friends rubbish is their important thing.
Bunty, he doesn’t like me meeting you at
all…..He totally hates it.
This is why I have come here to meet you.
Hello!
Yes Banjo!
What?
What are you saying?
Oh my God!
I left her healthy and happy.
Oh, my daughter.
Oh, my Zoyee!
Aliya my Zoyee.
Aliya my Zoyee has passed away.
May God have mercy.
My daughter has passed away.
Zoyee!
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
Long live!
Long live!
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
Long live!
Long live!
I divorce you!
Oh Shabbir, no.
Shabbir no.
No Shabbir.
I divorce you!
Shabbir don’t do this.
I divorce you!
If I don’t drag him into these very own streets…
Then I am not Chaudry Shabbir.
Your brother, my brother…
I will rip open his stomach
and take out all your money.
