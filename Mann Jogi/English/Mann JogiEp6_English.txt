Ok listen.
Don’t make any more mistakes.
Whatever I am telling you…You will say that only.
You both have come here in search of work.
Someone fed you something on your way and you both got unconscious…
He stole everything and left…
ID card, money, clothes, everything.
Ok?
Hey! Let me, let me do this.
Let me do this, I will do it.
No, I am doing it.
You take care of these clothes, I will do it.
I am doing it.
It’s no problem, I know how to do it.
Actually, it is supposed to be like this from here, like this…
And…this is ready.
I never knew how to do this task, I used to get scolded too on this task.
I only know how to do this.
I will take care of it.
Hmm
Ibrahim!
Mop inside as well, it’s very dirty
Ibrahim!
Madam has asked not to go inside.
Give it to me, you go.
You tell me, what to do, I will do it.
Come.
What happened? Is everything ok?
It’s very dirty.
You give me your stole.
Give it to me, give it to me, give me your stole.
Why?
Give it to me, don’t question me.
Why?
Give this to me.
No Ibrahim, I will do it.
I will do it, you will not do this.
You leave it please, leave it, I will do it.
I said, you will not do it, you give it to me.
Why not?
Because you are very respectable…And this
And this task doesn’t suit you.
And because I am present here.
I will do it, I am an expert in this task.
This is just one, there were four in the mosque.
Its not a problem, I will do it.
I will take care of it.
Hey! It’s not a problem.
He has found this from the washroom.
Should I…
Tell you something?
Hmm…tell me.
Actually
You cook potatoes with spinach very well.
Just potato with spinach?
No.
Mutton gravy, lady finger with meat, potato with minced meat…
You cook everything very well but…
The carrot pudding that you make…
That is very, very good by God’s grace.
You know, ever since the food started coming from your side…
The taste of the meals had completely changed.
Cleric Sir also used to praise your food a lot.
May I tell you one more thing?
Now, you must tell me.
Once, because of you…
I had to cheat big time.
May God forgive me.
Do you remember, once you sent carrot pudding?
I ate all of it, secretly in my room.
And
I did not tell Cleric Sir that you had sent carrot pudding.
Do you even know how to lie?
No.
But when the pudding comes before me…
I lose my mind, God knows what happens to me.
When will you cook it again?
These might be of some use to both of you…
Thank you!
No, I will take these.
No, give it to me, give it to me.
The clothes are nice.
Hmm.
I will go put them.
You look nice.
Thank you!
You also look nice.
Without looking?
No, I did see you.
Ibrahim!
Take a look, you won’t become a sinner.
I am your lawful wife.
Yes…
It’s the first time, I have seen a girl…
So closely.
Let’s go and cook food, come.
Aliya Madam!
In these clothes?
Yes.
People cook, wearing such clothes in big hotels.
No…
Uh
I will come when my clothes dry up.
What is wrong with these?
It doesn’t look nice.
It feels weird,
it’s the first time I am wearing pants.
I am not habitual.
But I am saying you look nice.
You did not even look at me and said that I am looking nice and I agreed.
I am looking at you so closely and telling you… That you look nice…
You don’t believe it.
I do believe.
Let’s go then.
Let’s go.
Ahan! Love birds.
What…
What does it mean, what was she saying?
She was praising.
I knew it…
That these clothes will fit both of you.
We also were slim like both of you…smart.
You look nice.
Oh!
God knows, when will this knee pain end?
Election is just a game.
If, we have lost today then we will win tomorrow.
But politics is not a game.
Politics is life.
Brother, the one who loses this, consider him dead.
Election is a trophy.
If we don’t get it today then we will get it tomorrow.
But politics…
Politics is an image, it’s an image.
Do you understand what is an image?
Love!
Affection!
Trust!
Faith!
Respect!
Esteem!
Which people have for you in their hearts.
Once it ends…
No trophy can bring it back.
And anyways…
We have just lost an ordinary committee election of the market
No election is ordinary, Sir.
It leaves a great impact.
When did I say not to get affected?
Do get affected.
Get affected for sure.
Keep your spirits high, instead of getting disheartened.
Look at your mistakes and weaknesses.
Prepare for the bigger elections.
In fact, I think, Chaudry Zubair…
Should get a congratulations message from Chaudry Shabbir.
Huh
Messages of congratulations are being sent through back door, Comrade…
And…
Sister in law also reached there with the sweets.
Oh, no, no, no, no, leave him.
Women of the family are not supposed to be mentioned in the politics.
Oh, come on, Mr. Chaudry!
How dare you take her name?
Oh let it go…Relax…
Calm down.
Wow! Great!
Awesome!
Aliya Madam, may I tell you something?
You cook potatoes with spinach…
very well.
You cook this so well that if you cook it every day, I can eat it every day.
And if you cook it three or four times a day…
I will eat it even then.
Shabbir also liked it a lot.
He used to make requests every other day or so.
His Mother had handed over the whole kitchen over to Noora.
She would cook just for the sake of it and leave.
So, now…
Will they ever be…
blessed by the food cooked by you?
Are you asking me or are you asking yourself?
I can’t even think about this, even if I were dead.
Even if you die, Shabbir will not be so lucky to have food made by me.
This is the main line…
And this is the hot wire…
Which brings the current.
Which one?
This one, right?
Yes, this one.
And this one is the cold.
OK.
And this is the cold wire.
What else do you teach him?
Cut it from here.
How did you both get married?
Was it love or arrange?
I guess, it was arranged.
Your parents must have forced him upon you.
Its good that he is at least helping you.
Mine was a big loser.
He used to sit at home and enjoy free meals.
I left him within a year.
It's better to keep a dog or a cat than have a husband like that.
At least they wag their tales when their stomach is full.
I have put the clothes….
for laundry.
I will pay the due amount.
Listen!
We both had a love marriage.
We went against everyone and got married.
Where are the clothes?
I have put them.
Which is the hot and the cold wire?
Which is the hot wire?
I forgot.
Aliya is not home.
I have come from her brother’s house…
She is not there too.
Why are you looking for her?
I have something important to discuss with her.
Baalay!
Enough of this! Leave from here.
This is the trait of a person with a higher status.
He picks up the indirect hints.
Shabbir brother…
Her friend has been diagnosed with cancer.
She wants to meet her once.
We will inform her, once she is back.
What have we women got to do with your politics?
You both may settle scores as you wish.
We have been friends even before this.
Hey Baalay!
You are still standing here, haven’t you left?
Come on, get out!
This is the problem of people from the lower cast.
They don’t understand something said repeatedly.
Get going.
Are you leaving or should l come?
Come on leave from here, get out!
Cheap man!
Maula daad brother!
Will you bring this from outside?
I am badly stuck with my assignment.
Sister! The outside chores are not my responsibility anymore.
He is sitting over there, send him.
Bringing groceries, is his duty now.
Ok!
So, Mr. Ibrahim will be responsible for the external duties now.
Will you be able to handle it?
Yes.
Come on, go and bring this.
Room no 204.
Which room?
204.
Repeat
204.
Get going, bring it quickly.
Ibrahim, grab a basket.
This is called a basket.
Ibrahim, here you go.
Give it to me, give it to me, I will do it, give it to me.
Give it to me, I will do it.
Forget it…Lady
I went outside, and I got late.
You just go and see where is your husband.
He might get lost.
They are enjoying so much, Aunty.
They are dating 24 hours.
From cleaning to grocery…
They are always glued together, it’s a limit.
And let me tell you something.
No matter how much you punish them…
They are happy with it.
Aliya!
What am I listening to?
Don’t do this again.
Bushra Madam, shouldn’t get a chance to complain.
I am saying this for the last time.
You go, she will do it and bring it.
Ibrahim can’t do groceries.
He has spent all his life in the mosque, he doesn’t have the experience.
What do you want now?
Should he spend all his life in a hostel?
You are not being fair to him.
Aliya Madam!
Hmm.
You must be thinking…
That what a big loser I am.
Useless!
No.
I don’t think like that at all.
Thanks a lot.
Otherwise, the rest of them think the same way.
You are upset with what Bushra has said, right?
No.
I don’t mind anything, anybody says.
Only you matter the most to me.
And I feel scared that you might get offended by something I say.
If you mind something…
God knows, what will I do.
Ibrahim, have you always been like this?
I mean…
Anxious, frightened, nervous….. and a useless person.
No, no.
I was not saying this.
If you are a useless person then everybody should be like you.
The world will become a better place.
I mean, simple.
No.
You know,
I used to be very sharp in my childhood.
My Grandmother had named me magic.
Because I was beyond anyone’s grasp.
I used to move my hands and legs so much while sleeping
that people used to think that I might runaway somewhere.
There was a hotel on the mountain top.
Then our house.
Below that was a bazaar.
I would roam around all day long.
Sometimes the hotel and then to the bazaar.
I was aware of everything.
What is there in the cabinet of which shop…
Who has come into the hotel to stay? Where has he come from? I knew everything.
My Grandmother used to say…
That you will become a bigger guide than your Father.
You will take people on a tour of every nook and corner of Kashmir.
But…
The earthquake destroyed it all.
Kashmir…
and my magic too.
This is why I am like this today.
Come, come Mr. Chaudry.
All good? What brings you here?
The Cleric of our mosque has filed a complaint.
The muezzin of the mosque has stolen the charity money and fled.
Oh, yes.
Rafaqat!
Rafaqat!
Listen to what Mr. Chaudry has to say….
Mr. Chaudry, I shall take your leave.
The SSP has called an emergency meeting.
What should I talk to the supervisor about Mr. SHO?
It’s been a week the complaint has been filed and you don’t even know about it.
Mr. Chaudry, within a week, a petrol pump has been robbed,
two murders have been committed…
And three VIP duties have been assigned.
Petrol pump…
VIP movement!
Are you comparing the petrol pump with a mosque?
Rafaqat!
Go.
No, Mr. Chaudry.
I am not comparing it.
You are…
You surely are comparing it.
If you are not comparing it but you are giving it equal importance as that of a mosque.
I did not mean this, I am just telling you about my commitment.
Mosque should be above all, Mr. SHO.
Above all.
Theft of even a single rupee from the mosque…
Is worth more than the crores stolen from a petrol pump.
You are right.
But what I mean to say is that…
You don’t catch the thieves of the mosques…
This is why the petrol pumps get robbed.
Mr. SHO, all your focus…
Should be on the mosque’s thief.
Otherwise, I have other ways to draw your focus.
Ibrahim!
Yes.
We are playing a game today.
Let’s see who wins the game?
Here…
The items mentioned in this list…
I will bring half of it and you will bring the other half.
It’s all here.
And whoever ….
At the counter ….
reaches here first…
Will win.
Ok?
Here you go.
Hold it.
Let me bring the trolley.
Go and bring the trolley.
Where will the money come from?
Bilqees Aunty will give it.
From where?
I don’t know from where, its her problem, you go and bring the trolley.
Ok don’t go, I am going to get it.
Where will I meet you?
Here, at this counter…
You will find me.
Ok bye!
Aliya Madam!
Yes.
I will not be able to do it, I am not getting it, I am just…
If you can’t do it then get lost.
Aliya Madam!
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty!
Bilqees Aunty, Anita!
Bilqees aunty!
What happened?
What happened? why are you crying?
Why are you crying so bitterly?
Tell me, why are you crying? why are you getting distressed?
Aunty, Ibrahim has left.
Where?
I don’t know.
Anita, call Anita.
Where can he go? Did you have a fight with him?
I asked him to get lost.
Where can he go?
He can’t move even a little without you.
He will really get lost, he will get lost, he will die, he has no one except me in this world.
Bilqees Aunty!
Ok, ok, ok.
Did you have a fight?
I also can’t move without him, I can’t move even a single step, I swear upon God, Aunty…
Bilqees Aunty, I will work for you for free all my life, I will serve you, please, look for Ibrahim, find him.
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
Listen, listen, listen to me.
Listen, stop, stop crying, quiet and listen to me.
Listen to me.
If I find him…
Then you will not leave this hostel for the rest of your life.
Ok?
Even if your punishment is over.
I will not leave, I will not leave, I swear, I will not leave.
Stand by your words then.
Ok?
I will, I will not go anywhere, find him.
Bilqees Aunty, call Anita.
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
Come on, lets look for him, let’s find him, let’s do it.
Stop crying.
Let’s go.
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
Come.
Your wife can’t move even a little without you.
Where were you?
Where did you go, where did you go?
He came with me.
Crazy girl, you left him in the mall, he was wandering there.
If I would not have had met him, he would have had got lost in actual.
I thought, you left me.
I thought that you left me…Ibrahim
Do you have a doubt on anyone other than Ibrahim?
Everything…
was under Ibrahim’s control.
There's no point in suspecting anyone else except him.
Isn’t it, Cleric Sir?
Hmm.
This seems like a problem.
Seems like a big problem.
A person, who has never seen the world outside the mosque…
Surely, someone else must have shown him this way.
Have to make it broad.
The circle of investigation….
needs to be broadened.
And Mr. Chaudry…
For that, I need your co-operation.
At your service, Mr. SHO.
Father used to do the same with me.
He would make me face the things, I was afraid of.
I was scared of height,
so he would take me to heights…
Would make me sit on high swings.
I was afraid of the streets, so he would take me to the market and then disappear himself.
Then I used to find a way home on my own.
I was scared of the dark,
so he would take me to the graveyard saying that we have to recite prayer.
This is why, I am not scared anymore.
Neither of the heights…
Nor of new paths or the dark
But I got scared today, Ibrahim.
I felt very scared.
As if, while showing you the path…I…
I lost track of my own way.
And there is only darkness ahead.
I got scared of this darkness.
I got very scared.
When after the earthquake…
I reached my village…
There was a heap of plunder there.
Everything was submerged…
Except for one hand that was outside.
My Mother’s.
Under a big stone.
I kept sitting there, holding that hand.
Kept crying…
Until I was conscious.
Then I fainted.
When I regained consciousness…then I…
I was in a bus.
I was in the Cleric Sir’s lap.
I cried a lot that day.
I cried bitterly.
For that hand.
And even today…
I felt like crying the same way.
By the way, what is the difference between you and the Cleric Sir?
He also was showing him the right path.
Then one day, he asked him to leave the right path.
You should treat him like a student or an assistant, which is his rightful place.
He will understand all the ways in a single day and he will become mature too.
Can’t you see the danger I am facing?
I can see that but you also become brave.
If he would have been so weak, he would not have been with me.
He is with you…
But are you with him?
Look, I have noticed that both of you share a very insecure relationship.
Anyone can abandon anyone, at any time.
He also has a fear and you also are scared.
What is this?
Look, whatever has happened with both of you…
That was an accident.
You have to build a relationship…
Only then you can come out of that accident.
And this is not only my idea…
Mother and Father also think the same.
Allah has planted the fragrant seed of love in my heart.
Your voice is very nice.
Do you know only one song?
It’s not a song…
It’s spiritual poetry.
Oh, my beloved! Without you…
My heart doesn't feel content.
Oh, my beloved! There is no one, more charming than you.
Wherever I might be…
I think about you only.
Don’t ask me about where my heart is…
It’s always with you.
The pain of parting from you…
Only my heart knows or God knows.
Here you go.
What is this for?
Keep it.
It’s for you.
I charge 50 rupees for laundry, for a single suit from every girl.
Cost price is 20 rupees.
The rest 30 rupees, are yours.
I am not that tyrant.
I have to act strict…
Otherwise, these girls can’t be controlled.
Thank you!
Listen!
Your punishment is ending next Sunday.
I hope, you remember your promise?
I will not make you work for free.
You have paid me even now
Oh, my beloved! Without you…
My heart doesn't feel content.
Oh, my beloved! There is no one, more charming than you.
Wherever I might be…
Hmhmhmhmhmhm.
Don’t ask me about where my heart is…
It’s always with you.
The pain of parting from you…
My heart doesn't feel content.
