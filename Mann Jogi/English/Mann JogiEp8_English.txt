My favorite.
I will give you, only if there is any left.
All of it will be left today.
It’s his favorite, he doesn’t leave it.
I will give you, if there is some left.
Your poor man is not coming today.
He is working overtime on the weekend.
I came to tell you this.
What will you do now?
I will do, what I am doing.
I will water the plants.
There, at the office…
There are only machines all around.
Man is obsessed with the computer…
Computer has overpowered the man.
Not…not even a single plant is there at the office.
You must have been feeling very angry towards me, right?
Not at all.
Doomsday is still far away.
Ibrahim!
Let’s go.
Let’s go to your office.
I will tell them that its because of me and I forced you.
I will plead them, beg before them, come on, let’s go.
No.
That job is not worth so much…
That you plead and beg before someone.
Ibrahim, let’s go, please, I am feeling very bad.
Aliya Madam!
What would I have had earned from that job?
What I had to earn…
You have already paid me lump sum.
May I say something?
I also can’t live without you.
Not even for a day…
Not even for an hour…
Not even for a second.
Anita, you have guests.
They are sitting outside in the common room.
OK.
Yes.
How are you, Anita?
You may ask for more if you need.
Just one would have been enough for me, if I had any information about both of them.
The rest is for both of them.
If Aliya needed of money, why would she have been wandering with a pauper?
Ask her to leave that man and live with her Brother.
I also would not keep any contact with her.
People have started talking.
The elections are due in a few months…
Brother’s position will worsen a lot.
It’s the woman, who faces problem after the divorce.
What problem does a man has?
He will announce the divorce after the election.
Isn’t it brother?
For the sake of my martyr Father…tell me.
You are saying as if she is sitting at my place.
If it had been so, I would have had definitely helped you.
You would…definitely help.
You have used this option with my parents as well.
It’s useless.
I have other options too…
Which you would not want to know about.
I do have an idea, Mr. Chaudry.
But I can’t help you any further.
My advice to you is that you let them be on their own…
And announce your divorce publicly.
Otherwise, she will do this herself.
Public…
They have nothing to announce publicly…
Except for humiliation.
Now you tell me, Mr. Chaudry…
How may more options do you have?
Don’t you feel scared?
You guys are enough to feel scared.
Now this is the divorce proof.
Now you both need a marriage certificate.
It’s very important.
Aunty, you ask Aliya, only then she would agree.
Where is Aunty?
Yes Aunty, you called for me.
Aliya!
These girls want to do something.
Aliya!
How did you and Ibrahim get married?
I had already told about it.
What do you mean?
Were there no pre-wedding functions or festivities or dancing?
No.
But we want to do all that.
Why are you looking at me, its Aunty’s plan.
Bilqees: Aliya, she wants an old woman like me to be a part of it.
I have told them that I can see my youth in Aliya.
I came to the city exactly like this holding your Uncle’s hand.
And created this whole set up.
It’s Aunty and Uncle’s 30th anniversary.
We want to have some fun but they are not ready to become the bride and the groom again.
Everybody is putting their share…
You both also put your share.
Our share…How should we both participate?
All these girls in the hostel have fallen in love with your love.
They are only making me an excuse.
We will celebrate your pre-wedding function only.
Some music.
A ritual…no, no, no, no.
Please! Say yes, say yes, please Aliya!
refuse to them…no, no, no.
Refuse to them, no way.
Please, Aliya, please, Aliya.
I, I…Ibrahim!
What is your problem?
Why are you bugging Aliya Madam?
Ooooo! Alaiya Madam!
Its justified now.
Yes, yes, its justified now.
Oh, my beloved! Without you…
My heart doesn't feel content.
Oh, my beloved!
There is no one, more charming than you.
Wherever I might be…
Don’t ask me about…
Greetings, Ibrahim brother!
Greetings!
How are you?
I am fine, Ibrahim brother.
Ibrahim brother, had great fun last night.
Yes.
Everybody was happy.
And I didn’t know that you also can dance.
No, I can’t dance, everybody forced me, so I danced a little just like that.
Ibrahim brother, it just struck me, someone is here to meet you.
With me?
Yes.
Who is it?
It’s some Cleric, he is standing downstairs.
What was his name?
Aaa…Cleric…
Cleric, Ghulam Rasool?
Yes.
Cleric, Ghulam Rasool.
He is standing downstairs.
Down stairs?
Yes.
Tell him that I am coming.
Ok, fine.
Aliya Madam!
Aliya Madam!
Where is Mr. Cleric?
Greetings!
Greetings!
Are you Mr. Ibrahim?
Yes, where is Mr. Cleric?
He is there at the end of the street.
Then call him upstairs.
No, no, he is sitting in the car, you come along, lets meet him, come.
Come, boss come, he is sitting in the car, it’s not a problem.
You should have brought him upstairs, we would have comfortably…
The car couldn’t turn, this street is very narrow.
Ok, ok.
It’s no problem, you relax and come.
When did the Cleric Sir come?
He came 5 minutes back.
OK.
Yes.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Police!
Come on, sit in the car.
You can’t do this.
Sit in the car.
Sit in the car.
Let’s go, let’s go.
Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Aliya Madam!
Aliya Madam!
Aliya Madam!
Yes, Maula Daad.
The police have arrested Ibrahim brother.
They seem like the ones under cover.
how could they be under cover?
You must know it.
You gave their guarantee.
He has done it, who else could it be other than Shabbir?
How did Shabbir reach here?
Who Shabbir?
The way he reached your call center, Anita.
Tell us also, a man has been arrested from here.
We also will be interrogated tomorrow.
Nothing will happen to you guys.
Why wouldn’t nothing happen to us?
After all, he has been arrested from here.
I have given the guarantee.
We saw your guarantee.
When police will raid the girl’s hostel, who will send their daughters here then?
I had asked you not to…
Stop it, you guys.
A man has been arrested here and you guys are worried about your business.
Have some fear of God, please.
Hello Fauzi buddy, how are you?
Buddy, there has been a problem.
Hello Fauzi!
Yes, yes, yes.
Was the police mobile from there?
Confirm?
OK.
Ok, fine, fine, I will let you know.
OK.
Its Shabbir.
Let’s go, Cleric Sir.
Salute to Mr. SHO.
May you live long.
Mr. Chaudry, don’t do this, it’s my duty.
You are awesome, you are great!
Cleric Sir, please come, have a seat, come.
Sir!
Wow! Wow!
Where did you find this shameless from then?
Don’t ask me Mr. Chaudry.
I found him with great difficulty.
You may say that we had deployed the entire city’s CID after him.
We have dug him out of the ground.
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Did you find him alone?
Oh, come on Mr. Chaudry, there won’t be a whole gang for a small charity box.
No, no, but you yourself said that there might be some other people behind him…
This is why I was asking.
Let’s see.
Let’s beat him up and then see, who he mentions.
Mr. Cleric!
I think, you should talk to him.
Act strict with him.
He might tell easily.
It’s a matter concerning the mosque.
Things will stay under wraps.
Isn’t it Mr. SHO?
What do you say Mr. SHO?
He is a kid, Sir.
But Mr. Butt, I want to appreciate.
You have done a great job.
Where did you find him from?
Rafaqat!
Present Mr. Chaudry’s man before him.
Yes, Sir
So, you were telling me about where did you find him from?
Enjoy the fruit Mr. Chaudry…
Why do you want to keep a score?
He must be hiding in some mosque, isn’t it?
Mr. Chaudry, you may say that we have…
Arrested him illegally.
Going beyond our limits.
We have kidnapped him in a way.
So, you…may say it was a mosque.
We have mentioned the same in the report as well.
Wonderful! Wonderful!
May you live long.
You go and have some tea and refreshment.
And take a little longer.
Good!
Where is she?
Where is Aliya?
Where is Aliya?
No, Mr. Chaudry.
Let me talk to him.
Let me…let me talk to him.
Dear…
Mr. Chaudry knows about everything.
Whatever you did was based on your faith.
As per her desire…
As per her wish…
The mistake you have made. dear…
Come on…now fix it.
Ibrahim dear!
Come on.
Dear!
I have done nothing wrong, Mr. Cleric.
Whatever I did, is with my own willingness.
Dear…
We have…
Given our word to Mr. Chaudry.
It’s a breach of trust.
If the commitment goes against our faith, one can always go against it.
His matter…is against the Islamic laws.
I have told you so many times…
Not to teach me Islamic rules.
Do you get it?
Should I talk to him or should I leave?
Make him understand Cleric Sir, make him understand.
I will explain it to him.
Dear…
Dear…
Whatever had to be done is past now.
Do you want to find a better solution or not?
A better solution has been found, Cleric Sir.
Me and Aliya…
Hey!
How dare you take Aliya’s name?
She is Chaudry Shabbir’s woman and suits him only and not with a sewer worm like you.
Whatever had to happen, dear…
It’s done.
Dear, you both don’t have a match.
Why are you causing trouble for yourself for no reason?
Me and Aliya are happy together.
Oh, your happiness…
What’s your happiness?
Just two meals on request, that’s it.
God knows, who is the poor girl begging before to feed you, you shameless!
She has ruined herself out of sheer stubbornness.
Dear…
I don’t think…
That whatever you are saying is wrong…
But it is stupidity.
If you don’t believe me, Cleric Sir…
Come with me.
Let’s go.
Come on, Mr. Cleric, let’s go quickly.
Let’s go quickly.
Not you Mr. Chaudry.
You are not permissible for her.
Not without her permission.
What do you think?
That I need your divorce.
You will rot in this dark cell all your life.
And she will spend her entire life washing dishes...
For this impermissible.
Why can’t you understand, Mr. Chaudry?
I am not scared of you today.
I feel pity for you.
Mr. Chaudry! Mr. Chaudry!
Nonsense.
Mr. Chaudry!
Mr. Chaudry, I think your anger is adding more fuel to the situation.
The matters which are caught up in emotions, are resolved with mutual understanding.
Give him a chance at least.
Let me meet that lady…
So that I can understand the situation a little.
Mr. Chaudry…
I have found a way out.
We will have to be patient to untangle it.
So, Mr. Chaudry…
Did you come up to some solution?
The boy has agreed.
It’s just collection time.
Very good!
It’s a good thing.
He is a kid.
He made a mistake.
He will improve himself.
Human beings do make mistakes.
Ok, it’s absolutely correct.
Cleric Sir…
Is ready to take back his complaint.
Ok?
Let’s withdraw Cleric Sir’s complaint.
We will do it for sure.
We can’t return the boy at the moment.
There is another complaint, filed against him.
About what?
About committing theft.
Chaudry Zubair has also filed a complaint against him…
That Ibrahim has stolen something from his house as well.
You guys just have to highlight Chaudry Shabbir’s name.
You must ensure his party somehow…
That if Chaudry Shabbir receives the ticket…
Victory is assured.
Why Mr. Chaudry?
Why should we contribute to the enemy's strength with our own efforts?
No matter how strong a fort made of sand is…
After all it’s made of sand.
No, Mr. Chaudry…
He has greatly provoked the emotions of those rowdy boys.
Don’t consider him so weak.
Relax!
My cards are very strong.
I will show, when the time comes.
Mr. Chaudry!
Cleric Ghulam Rasool is here to meet you.
You guys continue, I will just be back.
You sing very well.
You sing very well.
I enjoyed a lot.
Your harmony and tune are absolutely proper.
You were very good at giving the call to prayer.
We used to listen to it here five times.
If you would not have had sung this song…
Then I would not have had been able to reach you.
I reached your hotel through this song.
To the call center from there…
And to the hostel from there.
I hope you had not left the Cleric Sir because of this song.
Tell me.
And…people say that the matter is something else.
Seems like a big issue.
You tell me…
How big is this issue?
Have tea at least, come on, have some tea.
Drink it, drink it.
The tea is getting cold.
Hot tea soothes the throat somehow.
Have it.
Tell me, that…
What is your and Chaudry Shabbir’s problem?
Tell me.
I did not commit theft, Sir.
What, what?
I did not commit theft, Sir.
I also know that you did not commit theft.
But you are still sitting here.
There is surely something wrong.
Why?
What…what is the matter?
Actually…
Mr. Chaudry has become upset over something.
Mr. Chaudry has become upset.
About what?
I am asking, what is Chaudry Shabbir upset about?
God keeps a man’s faults hidden, Sir.
Man should also…
Keep a man’s faults hidden.
Look!
For the sake of this hidden secret…
You will suffer big time.
7 to 8 months is the minimum.
You are not getting my point, buddy.
Just tell me that what is the matter between you and Chaudry Shabbir?
That’s it.
Then I will drop you, where you came from…
Safe and sound…
In one piece.
I know it, Cleric Sir…that he is not a thief.
Then, Mr. Chaudry…
Why did you file a report against him?
You also know, Cleric Sir that he is not a thief.
Why did you file a report against him?
Actually…
He was lost…he had left.
How is this going to work?
I will consider it, only if you will tell me the truth.
Have mercy on that innocent.
I will pray for you all my life.
Ah! You are right.
Prayers are important but we don’t need prayers only.
We need votes as well.
My apologies, I came to meet you leaving a meeting.
People are waiting for me.
Bye!
So.
I hope you know what to do.
You have to ensure his party that Chaudry Shabbir will get the ticket.
Mr. Chaudry…
Why should we make our enemy’s fort stronger?
Who do we have in the lock up?
Sir, Shehzad Sarwar and Mitthoo.
Who is the most dramatic among them?
Sir, its Sarwar.
He screams on the top of his voice, if we touch him.
But he doesn’t accept.
OK.
Do one thing…
Beat him up in front of this boy.
Yes, Sir.
Ok, Sir.
His wife is here, Sir.
Whose?
Ibrahim’s.
Wife?
She is saying the same, Sir.
What not is coming out of this charity box.
Send her in.
Sir!
Yes.
Greetings!
I have come to ask about Ibrahim, why have you arrested him?
What is your relation with him?
He is my husband.
According to our information, he is unmarried.
What’s his crime?
When did you guys get married?
It’s been 2 months and 11 days.
Do you know Chaudry Shabbir?
Yes, I definitely know him.
What is his problem with Ibrahim?
I am here to ask the same that what is his problem with Ibrahim?
Who had asked you to go and talk to him, Cleric Sir?
You should have held his collar.
You have a great power…
The power of the pulpit.
Who said so?
Who said that the pulpit is power?
Pulpit is a belonging.
I am already sunk into a guilt of a problem.
He will destroy everything…
He will ruin everything.
He will destroy me.
The door of the repentance is still open, Mr. Chaudry.
Turn to Him.
Don’t you care even a little about Ibrahim?
God will protect him.
Oh God!
Yes, Mr. Butt.
Ibrahim’s wife is sitting here in my police station.
She wants to meet you.
Bunty!
There has been a blast.
Aliya has reached the police station and she is saying that she is Ibrahim’s wife.
I thought there is going to be a bomb blast.
There has been an atomic explosion.
You get out of this.
He is caught in my grasp and you are telling me that…
If you want to cut his throat then but it in the battle field.
Not barging into his house.
You were abusing Aliya yesterday and today…
You may also abuse her.
Abuse her as much as you want to…
But in front of me only.
Not on the street outside, at the square, or on this phone.
Do politics Zubair…
Don’t do cheap stunts.
What is wrong with you?
Take some cold water and get back to conscious.
Aliya has really got married to Ibrahim.
She called me…
To ask about bubbly.
Oh no! oh stop! Oh! Oh no! my nose got cut.
Oh! Oh!
For God’s sakes, don’t do this brother.
Stop it brother.
Oh!
Aaa!
Leave me!
Aaa!
Leave me!
Aaa!
You answer me please, I hope no one has harmed you.
No.
Shabbir…
Did he raise his hand on you?
He is going crazy for you.
if he sees you, he will kidnap you.
You should not have had come,
The truth is that Shabbir himself has got me married to him.
Why would he get his wife married to someone else?
Do you think we are fools?
For remarrying.
Both of you leave from here silently.
I am being that much lenient, you should consider it enough.
