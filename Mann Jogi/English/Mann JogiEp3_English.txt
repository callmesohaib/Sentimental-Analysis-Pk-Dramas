Mother, what is wrong with you?
I said it out of anger.
Does someone give a divorce out of love too?
Ok, I will give charity Mother, what is wrong with you?
There is no room for adjustments in Islamic laws.
My apologies.
Have some water.
What…
what were you doing?
What should I have been doing then?
I am not even worthy to be cursed…
Don’t …don’t be stubborn, have some water.
Aliya Madam, don’t worry.
The man is responsible in such matters.
I will give the answer, I will take care of it, you…
No one will question you.
As if woman is some vessel.
One dirties it and hands it over to the other person.
The other person cleans it and returns it to the first.
I will not go back, Ibrahim.
Better to die at the hands of an honorable
person than to live with a shameless person.
My blood is forgiven for you; I will write it down.
No, I can’t do this.
Aliya Madam, I can’t do this, I …
What can you do then?
What can you do?
You are scared of humans, you are scared of God.
If you did not have the courage to refuse
then you should have runaway.
You couldn’t do that either.
You stayed here to be taken care by Shabbir.
If you would have had runaway, I would
not have had to face this night.
I had packed my bags but the cleric stood before me.
I tried to runaway but…
He could not runaway, he would
have been answerable, he…
Ok then fulfill the responsibility that
the cleric has imposed on you.
Why are you sitting here and crying for your parents?
Ibrahim!
Ibrahim!
The time for morning prayers is close.
Shabbir is waiting for his belonging, get up.
Get up.
Let me run away, Ibrahim.
You can do this much at least, in God’s name.
Hey, hey, hey,
Aunty!
What are you doing?
Its Usman inside.
Then where did…she go?
She?
Who she?
Our Aliya, who else?
Aliya?
Where did she come from?
Oh! Since she has got married to Chaudry Shabbir…
She has forgotten about us, poor folks.
Aunty!
Who told you about Aliya?
I have seen her myself coming towards your house.
There was a man also with her.
Aunty!
You have searched the whole house, have you?
Hmm.
Only the rooftop is left.
Go and check the rooftop too, go.
Where did she go then?
Have some water.
Then…
Who was she then?
She…
Oh yes, I remember, the polio team came over.
To give drops to the children.
OK.
I became happy thinking that I will get to meet Aliya…
And I will tell her husband…
To get my son a job.
I have heard that he has a lot
of influence in the offices.
I had brought this chit…
And a little money too…
For the sweet.
I thought that he will give it to the officers…
And my son will get a job.
You do one thing…
Let me talk to her on the mobile phone.
I don’t have balance in my mobile.
Ok…
fine, then give it to her.
And give her my message too.
OK.
Scorpion
Tsh!
Tsh! Tsh! Tsh!
Aaaa!
Aliya Madam!
Where is your stole?
Anyways…
Whatever is happening…
You must have forgotten about the stole.
Sister in law was asking me
about where my stole was?
Brother, Shabbir did not let it be on my head.
His anger left me unveiled.
I kept thinking that he must have
done that out of anger.
But he did not decide about the
Halala marriage out of anger.
He must have imagined but he
still took the same decision.
He was not saving me, Brother.
He was saving his honor and his politics.
One commits a sin…
And someone else bears the atonement,
this is not fair, Brother.
And…
To go through an act, which makes you feel sick.
He did not have to go through it, I had to go through it.
That’s why he is a nobody to me.
He is dead with all his ego.
What did you decide then?
I won’t be able to do it.
What can’t you do?
I can’t go to another man…
You will not go just like that.
You will get married properly.
You weren’t that old when you became a widow…
Why didn’t you get married then?
Death snatched my husband from me.
Life is snatching it away from you,
you can take him back.
Shabbir has no objection that
I will go to another man…
Again, the same thing.
He will be your husband and no stranger.
And Shabbir too, will go through this pain.
It’s like death for a husband to
send his wife to another man.
You guys will have to go through it.
Now that you have made a mistake then…
It wasn’t my mistake.
Ok, it wasn’t your mistake?
Did she tie your hands and feet and took you along?
And the videos you got made and
hand them over to everyone.
My son got embarrassed before the whole party.
He is still ready to own you.
He is holding your hand after walking over embers.
But you are so thankless.
What should we do, should we send
you to your Brother’s house?
Tell me.
Your Brother will kill himself.
He went through such a hard time while
saving his Sister in law’s house.
Look…
You will go to some other man too anyways.
Tell me.
After leaving from here….
You will knock at someone else’s door too
There is no space for you in your Brother’s house.
Should I hand her over to anyone random man?
What will you do then?
Will you take her marriage proposal yourself?
Even an animal licks and cleans its plate…
What does this mean?
Can a person eat food in it?
Anyways…
it is not so…..We will have to look
for a relative or an outsider.
Anyways…
Don’t you worry.
We will find a way out.
Let me offer prayers.
Ok?
If someone asks about Shabbir,
tell them that he is not home.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Actually
The mosque’s electricity is gone.
Its time for call to prayer.
Call some electrician.
Jawaid has gone to Lahore and…
The Cleric doesn’t allow Altaf.
He says
that he is a Non-Muslim.
Shabbir is sleeping, he is not well.
You guys do something on your own.
Sister!
If sister helps us…
She is skilled in electrical work.
It will make the job easier, I will give a call to prayer.
It will not take long, just for a short time, if she…
Helps us, it will be good.
Can’t you understand once?
I said, do something on your own.
My apologies…I…
I will look after it, don’t be angry.
My apologies.
I shall leave.
Shabbir!
Shabbir!
I have found the guy.
Ibrahim.
Ibrahim!
Read it loudly.
Finish your school.
I have to talk to you.
OK.
Hey!
Finish the lesson, I had told you and you too.
I will be back in an hour and will listen to it.
Ok, good boys?
Let’s go.
Ibrahim, buddy!
I have made a huge mistake.
I need your help.
God will do best.
You just order me.
It’s not an order, buddy…
It’s a request.
I am at your service brother, tell me.
Buddy…
I have…
Given a divorce to Aliya.
There is no power or strength except with Allah.
What do I do now?
Brother…
The cleric can guide you better but what
I have heard from him is that…
In such a situation, you should choose
to separate yourself with courtesy.
If you have given any gifts or if you owe
her any rights, fulfill those please.
Yes, yes, yes.
Don’t teach me the Islamic rules.
Sure, my apologies.
I know, I am aware of it.
If she marries someone else and gets a
divorce from him, she can remarry me.
Yes, yes, exactly.
Isn’t it?
Is it so?
Yes.
So then…
This has to be done.
This has to be done, Ibrahim.
You…
Get married to Aliya.
Did he agree?
You may say…
That he has almost agreed.
No, no, Aunty, not Ibrahim.
Why?
Why not Ibrahim?
If not Ibrahim, then…
have you found someone else?
Someone else?
I mean,
some old acquaintance, someone
from the neighborhood…
Someone from school or college,
who might have been after you.
Beautiful girls do have lovers.
Aunty!
Look, why can’t you understand?
Shabbir loves you a lot.
He doesn’t want to send you to some loser.
Ok…if, not Ibrahim…
Then suggest someone of your choice.
He is like a Brother to me.
Before marriage, Shabbir was also…
like a brother to you, what kind of a logic is this?
He is a very pious boy…Aunty.
So?
Do you want to marry a thief, a rogue
or a troublemaker?
I am sorry, Mr. Chaudry.
What you are talking about….
is a very big sin.
I can’t go ahead with this marriage.
I respect her a lot…
This is why I am asking you Ibrahim.
This is why, I am asking you that she will restart her life with the same respect and honor, where it broke off from.
Otherwise, she…
will become homeless and destitute.
If you will not agree…
then what will I do?
I will hold her hand and left her to her Brother’s house….Whatever will happen to her life after that…
Who will be responsible for that?
Who will it be, it will be you, who else?
Sir, me…?
My Mother has brought you up like his own child.
Yes…yes.
I have treated you like a younger Brother.
Yes, definitely.
If you will not stand by me in this
hard time, then who else will?
Mr. Chaudry, the thing is that…
My honor…
My dignity, my privacy, everything…
Everything, is in your hands now.
Look…
I have hardened my heart, haven’t I?
I have hardened my heart, haven’t I?
Yes.
Aliya will also do so.
Its just
You also harden your heart.
Whatever you will say…
I will follow that all my life.
I will not forget about your favor, all my life.
Mr. Chaudry, I am…
not a big religious scholar.
What you are saying…
is a sin Mr. Chaudry…it’s a sin.
I have told you…
Don’t teach me the Islamic laws.
Take your belongings and…
And get out of this house.
Right now.
And ask your Brother to find a new man for you.
Our relationship is over.
After the divorce….
You have got only these two dresses
Come on, get out.
Pack my bags too.
You…
There will be no space for me
in the mosque after this.
You are not at fault in this.
I was the one, who brought you on my shoulders.
A mosque is God’s house.
Why are you leaving then?
After this insult…
It is not justified for me, to stay here.
You couldn’t bear it during your youth…
How will I be able to tolerate all this in this old age?
Chaudry Shabbir…
Will account for every single morsel.
The politics here has made him generous.
When that will not exist…
Then why would he allow me to stay here?
Can’t I stay like Noora in this house?
You get remarried.
I am already facing taunts for my infertility.
You can’t spend a day with another man and…
You are tying me with another woman,
for the rest of my life.
It’s difficult for a woman…
Very difficult, in fact, it is impossible.
She can hand herself over to one man only.
Aliya, a woman can not at all look at another man.
To get you again…
Only I know the suffering, I will endure
Ibrahim…
is a very clean and tidy man…
If he would not have been there…then I myself,
would have had separated from you.
I would never have had let you
pass through this stinky path.
I had a word with Ibrahim….
He respects you a lot and…
To make you restart an honorable life…He..
I will never be able to meet them.
Everything has been destroyed.
My life has been ruined.
It is not so dear.
It is so.
It is exactly like that.
Either you are lying to me now or you
have been lying to me all your life.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Mother, it is not needed.
It’s ok.
There is a need.
Here you go.
Take a shower and wear it.
Take a good shower and…
wear it.
This is for you.
Thank you
When Shabbir had died for you…
Why were you sitting in that house then?
Were you waiting for this day?
I was waiting for my death, Sister-in-law.
What do you think, Mr. Chaudry?
If she is dead… then
where is the dead body?
A suicide attempt has been made…
Because
I have seen both of them alive.
Cleric Sir!
I hope you are not hiding anything.
How can I become a reason for your
disgrace and dishonor, Mr. Chaudry?
And neither can Ibrahim dare to do this.
What is happening then, Sir?
Where should I look for them? Where should I search for them? Whom should I hold accountable?
Whom should I confront?
If you don’t mind…
May I say something, Mr. Chaudry?
There is only one door…
Which has the answer to it.
Repentance.
There is just one door…
Where we can find an answer to it.
In this act…
There has been a violation of divine commands.
Please, appeal to Him…
To show mercy and resolve this problem.
Ease these difficulties.
And the one that is hidden and concealed ….
reveal and unhide it…
Cleric Sir, nothing like that is going to happen.
Because I will not stay idle.
You…
You will come with me to his house.
House?
His entire village was a heap of debris.
Only one child was left there…..
Whom I
brought here in my lap.
What have you done?
Story is not…
What she is narrating.
The matter is different.
She has not been divorced.
She has fled in the name of love.
What rubbish are you talking about?
I am not talking rubbish.
I am right…..You will see, it will
turn out to be like this later.
May I leave?
Yes.
What will you tell them?
What had been decided…
That you ran away and I was looking for you.
You can’t say this anymore.
The cleric saw us leaving together, didn’t he?
Now you will say that you were coming to drop me back home and I ran away on the way.
Then you returned after looking for me.
Do you get it?
OK.
You don’t seem like you have understood.
No…
there is
there is a problem.
What problem?
Divorce…
How…?
Here…?
Right now?
