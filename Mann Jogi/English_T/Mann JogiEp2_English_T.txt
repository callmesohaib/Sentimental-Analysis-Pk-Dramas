[00:37] Ibrahim, shut the door.
[00:46] Shut the door.
[00:47] I divorce you!
[00:49] Oh Shabbir, no.
[00:50] Shabbir, no.
[00:51] No, Shabbir.
[00:51] I divorce you!
[00:53] Shabbir don’t do this.
[00:54] I divorce you!
[01:06] Prayer is better than sleep.
[01:13] Prayer is better than sleep.
[01:21] God is the greatest, God is the greatest.
[01:30] There is no God but Allah.
[01:45] Where are both of them?
[01:49] Where are they?
[01:50] Haven’t they reached yet?
[02:11] Hurry up, dear.
[02:13] The time for call to prayer is running out.
[02:19] Be quick.
[02:29] They might have gone from the next street…
[02:32] To avoid being seen by people.
[02:41] Aliya!
[02:45] Aliya!
[02:48] Shabbir, what happened?
[02:49] Aliya hasn’t returned yet, isn’t it?
[02:50] No, what happened?
[02:52] What has happened?
[02:53] Wait Mother.
[02:54] Tell me, what has happened?
[02:55] Aliya!
[02:56] Oh my God, what has happened?
[02:58] Who are you calling?
[02:59] Hey!
[03:02] Shabbir, tell me something.
[03:04] What has happened?
[03:10] What…Where is the phone ringing?
[03:24] She has run away.
[05:05] I made a mistake, Aliya Madam.
[05:08] Be careful!
[05:17] Be careful! Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!
[06:27] Greetings!
[06:28] Greetings!
[06:29] Stay here, I will bring it.
[06:40] Greetings!
[06:43] Noora, at least, look at how I am sitting,
you just let anyone in the house.
[06:48] Madam, he is not a stranger, he is our Ibrahim.
[06:50] He is the mosque’s servant.
[06:52] His and the Religious Scholar’s meals…
[06:55] Go from here only.
[07:38] Forgive me, I didn’t know.
[08:35] Let Mother finish her prayers and then
she will give you the food.
[08:37] Actually…
[08:40] Madam…
[08:41] asked me to bring the motor.
[08:46] Ibrahim, come here.
[08:48] Hmm?
[08:49] Come here, come here.
[08:52] Yes.
[08:53] This belt…yes, hold it tightly…yes.
[08:58] Just a minute!
[09:02] Leave it.
[09:03] Leave it, leave it.
[09:07] Turn on the switch.
[09:09] Hmm?
[09:10] Switch.
[09:14] From where?
[09:16] Inside.
[09:32] Turn it on.
[09:34] It’s the second button.
[10:10] Who is Chaudry Zubair?
[10:13] Hmm?
[10:14] Who is he?
[10:15] Where does he stand? What is his worth?
[10:21] He is funded by the British government.
[10:25] He has been paid, to get his own people arrested…
[10:28] These lands…Over which he parades as a landlord.
[10:31] You are absolutely right.
[10:32] This business, these shops,
where has this come from?
[10:36] His Father is a subservient to his officers.
[10:38] He is a fraud.
[10:40] He is a thief….a robber
[10:42] One holds a character.
[10:45] What is this cheap man’s character?
[10:49] He is a thief, a thief.
[10:53] All the funds of the municipal committee…
[10:55] He has collected in his trunk.
[10:58] What has he turned this town into?
[11:00] Broken roads, dirty streets, sewers.
[11:03] If I don’t drag him into these streets…
[11:07] Then I am not Chaudry Shabbir.
[11:10] Your Brother, my Brother…
[11:11] I will rip open his stomach…
[11:13] And take out, all your money.
[11:15] Your Brother, my Brother!
[11:16] Make my hands stronger.
[11:18] I will make sure he faces the consequences.
[11:20] Your Brother, my Brother!
[11:22] Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
[11:23] Your Brother, my Brother!
[11:25] May I help you?
[11:26] Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
[11:27] No, it’s almost done.
[11:29] Take this.
[11:31] Your Brother, my Brother!
[11:33] Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
[11:34] And bring the dirty dishes, if there are any.
[11:36] Sure, ok.
[12:52] Where are both of them?
[12:59] Apparently…
[13:03] He has taken nothing with him.
[13:30] Oh! Oh! Oh!
[13:35] Sir!
[13:39] Once during my childhood, my ball fell
into the neighbor’s house.
[13:42] They were not returning it.
[13:45] Four people’s head…
[13:49] Two arms…
[13:51] And a leg…I broke and injured all
these and brought my ball back.
[13:58] That was just a ball.
[14:03] This is my wife.
[14:08] No one will be spared.
[14:12] Not even you.
[14:23] Don’t you want to go to school?
[14:24] You don’t want to go?
[14:25] Don’t go.
[14:26] Don’t eat my brains.
[14:28] You are always whining.
[14:29] I have told you so many times not to raise
your hand on my daughter, leave her.
[14:33] Am I raising my hand?
[14:34] I am scolding her.
[14:35] You go ahead and fulfill her demands.
[14:36] Come and sit.
[14:37] I don’t have a single penny.
[14:39] What is the matter? What does my Princess want?
[14:41] I want a trolley bag.
[14:43] All my friends have it, I can’t carry so many books.
[14:47] That’s it?
[14:48] Yes, that’s it.
[14:50] Do you know, how much is the trolley bag for?
[14:52] It’s for 5000 rupees.
[14:54] Ok tell me, what is the date today?
[14:55] 17.
[14:57] 17…So…
[14:59] How many days are left for the
next month to start? 13 days.
[15:02] Do you know how will you carry your bag then?
[15:05] Like this.
[15:06] Like a trolley.
[15:09] Wow! Great!
[15:11] You and your sister…
[15:13] Both are experts in making a fool out of the girl.
[15:14] She also said that she will get a trolley bag.
[15:16] Since that day till date, the bag never came.
[15:21] Where is the phone?
[15:22] Did you have breakfast?
[15:24] What did you eat?
[15:24] Bread and peas.
[15:26] Your sister has a very long life.
[15:27] I think, your trolley bag has arrived.
[15:29] There you go…
[15:30] It’s your Aunt’s call.
[15:32] She must be missing you.
[15:33] Talk to her.
[15:34] Good morning Aunty, where are you?
[15:40] What?
[15:40] Give it to me
[15:41] Hello!
[15:42] It’s me dear.
[15:44] Yes, greetings Aunty.
[15:46] How are you?
[15:47] God is great, you tell me, how are you?
[15:49] All is well, how are things with you?
[15:52] Has Aliya arrived safely?
[15:54] No.
[15:56] Aliya left for your house early in the morning.
[16:03] No Aunty, she has not reached here….
Is everything alright?
[16:07] She has not reached?
[16:09] Yes, both husband and wife had a fight.
[16:13] The husband left for somewhere
and she left for somewhere.
[16:17] It’s like this.
[16:19] This is very strange, one doesn’t
leave the house like this.
[16:23] Its ok.
[16:24] Safely…
[16:26] When she reaches safely, let me know.
[16:28] I am worried.
[16:29] Ok Aunty, I will let you know and I will
talk to her too, when she comes.
[16:33] No, no, don’t say anything to her, don’t
make a fuss, just keep her there.
[16:37] You just inform me, I will come and talk to her myself.
[16:41] And listen…
[16:42] You will not talk to her, you don’t know anything…..Did you get it?
[16:45] OK.
[16:46] Just make her stay there, ok?
[16:48] Ok Aunty, you don’t worry.
[16:50] Ok, may God protect you.
[16:58] Oh my God!
[16:59] Leave it, leave it.
[17:00] I said leave it.
[17:00] If she needed to get home, she
would have had arrived by now.
[17:02] So… What will you do? What will you do then?
[17:04] What do I do then? Should I keep sitting idle?
[17:05] Yes.
[17:06] Leave it.
[17:06] Mother, don’t test me.
[17:07] I said, leave it.
[17:09] Leave it.
[17:11] Shabbir, this is not your politics…
[17:14] That you will stand on the main
road and utter rubbish,
[17:16] and someone will come running
to put a hand on your mouth.
[17:20] One doesn’t find a fish by only jumping into the river.
[17:23] One has to put a fish trap and wait patiently.
[17:26] Will she come back home by herself?
[17:29] What will you do then?
[17:30] Tell me, what will you do?
[17:31] Neither you have a clue about the girl
nor are there any traces of the boy.
[17:33] You will keep roaming around, with a toy
in your hand…And will keep firing.
[17:36] Will the people not hear the silence in this house?
[17:40] Look!
[17:41] You get hold of yourself.
[17:43] Let me handle the rest.
[17:46] For how long Mother? For how long?
[17:48] I can’t understand it myself that what has happened?
[17:51] Neither has Aliya got the guts to run away…
[17:54] Nor that boy has the courage to make her run away.
[17:57] Look!
[17:59] Cool down and think about it.
[18:01] Just think, that…
[18:02] that what has happened?
[18:04] How has this happened?
[18:05] Huh?
[18:07] Come on…
[18:08] Cool down…
[18:09] Calm down…
[18:10] Mother, leave me.
[18:10] Come on, my son.
[18:12] Keep quiet.
[18:13] Be brave!
[18:59] Coming! Be patient.
[19:03] People don’t want to wait.
[19:05] Wait, I am coming.
[19:09] Aliya!
[19:10] Greetings!
[19:11] Greetings!
[19:13] You are here so early in the morning,
is everything alright?
[19:15] What has happened?
[19:17] Who is inside?
[19:19] Who would be inside?
[19:20] You are making me anxious.
[19:22] Where are you going?
[19:24] Come.
[19:25] Who?
[19:29] Greetings!
[19:30] Greetings!
[19:34] Let’s go.
[19:37] Let’s go.
[19:42] Sit right here.
[20:09] What have you put in Aliya’s room?
[20:11] Some round sweets.
[20:13] Where have you brought it from?
[20:14] From my home.
[20:16] You did not have money to buy
5kgs of flour till yesterday…
[20:18] Today, you are distributing sweet.
[20:20] My husband has returned from Lahore last night…
[20:22] Tell me honestly.
[20:23] I swear Madam.
[20:25] You will get beaten up, liar!
[20:26] You have put it twice earlier as well, isn’t it?
[20:28] I can swear upon the Holy Book
madam, I am not lying.
[20:30] You have started paying visits to Chaudry
Zubair’s house, right?
[20:33] Not me, she sent it through my Sister in law.
[20:35] Leave.
[20:36] Madam, listen to me.
[20:37] I said, leave from here.
[20:38] Madam, I have small kids.
[20:39] Don’t show me your face from today onwards.
[20:40] Madam, listen to me at least.
[20:41] Really?
[20:42] You get fed here and bring sweet from there.
[20:44] Madam!
[20:44] Leave from here
[20:45] Chaudry Zubair, sent it through his wife.
[20:46] Get lost from here.
[20:48] Shameless!
[20:58] She would have had come every day
and asked about her.
[21:03] You have already given up, Mother.
[21:08] Whether the journey is long or short…
[21:12] One should not carry unnecessary burden, dear.
[21:40] Show me.
[21:42] No, no,
[21:43] I did not tell anything.
[21:45] That boy…
[21:46] Who calls out to prayer in the mosque…
[21:48] Yes.
[21:49] He has come with her.
[21:52] Will you ask me everything on the phone?
[21:53] Come here quickly.
[21:56] Hurry up!
[21:57] Come quick.
[22:10] Brother left early today.
[22:12] Yes.
[22:13] He has gone to drop Rimsha to school.
[22:16] She had created a fuss…
[22:17] That she wants a trolley bag…
[22:19] So,
[22:20] She missed the bus too.
[22:22] He has taken her along with great difficulty.
[22:26] She doesn’t let us buy it.
[22:27] She says that Aunty has promised me…
[22:30] I will take it from her only.
[22:36] Will you not tell anything?
[22:39] What has happened?
[22:41] Did you have a fight?
[22:44] No problem.
[22:45] Husband and wife, do fight over petty issues.
[22:49] Don’t you remember…
[22:49] Afshan and Mehmood?
[22:51] Such a trivial matter, had escalated
to the point of divorce.
[22:55] If your husband would not have
had intervened that day…
[22:57] They would have gotten divorced…
[22:59] Here…
[23:00] Sitting right here, she used to cry here all day long.
[23:05] Listen!
[23:07] A man’s anger…
[23:09] Is like a cracker.
[23:11] Such huge noise…
[23:13] And …
[23:14] such a small spark.
[23:16] The far you stay away from it, the better.
[23:18] Or you will burn yourself.
[23:21] Listen!
[23:23] A woman’s clothes catch fire first.
[23:31] Do you have an ointment or something
else to apply on the wound?
[23:34] Najma: Open this cupboard and see…
[23:35] It must be inside it.
[23:40] Ok tell me…
[23:41] What will you have in breakfast?
[23:42] Eggs,
[23:43] flat bread,
[23:44] chicken and peas,
[23:45] beef stew.
[23:46] Tell me quickly, Usman will bring it on his way back.
[23:47] Nothing.
[23:48] Listen!
[23:50] Your Mother in law called…
[23:52] A while ago.
[23:54] Your husband has also run away from the house.
[23:56] The poor woman is very worried.
[23:58] Tell me honestly…
[24:00] What has happened?
[24:00] What is the argument about?
[24:04] Sister in law, don’t tell anything
to anyone at the moment.
[24:06] Ask Brother also not to.
[24:24] Here you go.
[24:26] The bathroom is at the back.
[24:30] Clean it properly, or it will get infected.
[24:41] Coming.
[25:00] Greetings Brother!
[25:01] May you live long.
[25:10] Listen!
[25:11] Sit.
[25:23] You go to the bathroom.
[25:29] I hope you didn’t inform her Mother in law.
[25:31] She is asking not to.
[25:32] She didn’t fight or argue over a small issue.
[25:35] There must be a big problem.
[25:36] Whether the problem is small or big…
[25:39] Go and drop her to her house.
[25:41] This will maintain respect for both you and us.
[25:44] Don’t prolong the matter.
[25:46] Go
[25:48] OK.
[26:12] Ahem
[26:16] May I go?
[26:19] Do I have your permission?
[26:21] Have breakfast at least.
[26:25] No…
[26:28] I will get late.
[26:31] Where will you go?
[26:36] To the mosque.
[26:39] I will go there only.
[26:42] They will kill you.
[26:49] I have to go after all.
[26:58] Let me talk to Brother in front of you,
we will think about it later then.
[27:08] OK.
[27:38] Its Zubair’s wife.
[27:55] Which prison cell are you living in?
[27:57] Even the prisoners in the jail have the
permission to eat and drink.
[28:00] You don’t have that even.
[28:03] Yes, Mrs. Chaudry, you are absolutely right.
[28:06] It is exactly like this.
[28:07] Aliya is living a prison cell, she doesn’t
get to eat or drink and…
[28:12] She is not allowed to meet anyone as well.
[28:14] Please, don’t trouble yourself too.
[28:17] For no reason….
[28:18] You will get disheartened
[28:21] Aliya!
[28:22] Take this phone.
[28:24] And you are not allowed to answer anyone’s
call also from today onwards.
[28:54] I will just tell them that you have reached safely.
[28:56] She sounded very worried.
[28:58] Brother, you will call them,
their problem will get solved…
[29:02] But when you people will get disturbed,
there is no limit to that.
[29:05] You forget it, I will talk to them in my own way.
[29:07] It’s not going to create a disaster.
[29:12] Ok then, you talk to them…
[29:14] Resolve their troubles, I shall leave.
[29:17] Ok, sit…
[29:19] Sit down.
[29:34] This conflict did not start last night, Brother.
[29:37] It actually ended last night.
[29:41] I have been enduring extreme stress for
the past three months and ten days.
[29:46] Najma.
[29:47] Yes.
[29:47] Take Brother inside, serve him breakfast, let us talk.
[29:51] We will discuss it in his presence.
[29:53] Aliya!
[29:54] Household matters should stay within the house.
[29:57] Come on Brother, get up.
[29:59] Come Brother.
[30:01] No, keep sitting Ibrahim.
[30:03] Ok fine.
[30:05] Get up, we shall go inside and talk.
[30:07] Yes, come.
[30:08] We will talk right here.
[30:11] Aliya!
[30:13] Why are you dragging this poor man in this?
[30:16] Things will leak out tomorrow…
[30:18] Your husband will mind it.
[30:20] Which husband?
[30:24] Shabbir has divorced me.
[30:26] This is my husband, Ibrahim.
[30:29] I got married to him last night.
[30:33] And Shabbir himself, has got this marriage done.
[31:06] Is she gone?
[31:10] No.
[31:12] You will go and drop her.
[31:18] These are your clothes.
[31:22] Shoes…
[31:23] Suit….
[31:24] She bought them today only.
[31:29] Wear this and get ready, come on.
[31:33] Let’s take the drummers along too.
[31:37] Let’s take the entire wedding procession.
[31:42] You stay busy with your processions and rallies.
[31:46] How would you know the joys
of a wedding procession?
[31:50] She went today.
[31:51] She went with Ibrahim.
[31:53] To buy shoes, clothes, vests, socks for you…..
And so many other things she bought.
[31:59] She met Zubair’s wife there, who dragged her along.
[32:02] And she went along.
[32:05] Her daughter had passed away.
[32:21] It’s a cat, which has died Mother.
[32:24] She also got to know after she reached there.
[32:28] And when she was running away…
[32:30] Your enemy’s procession arrived, right then.
[32:36] You should have asked.
[32:37] You should have listened to her for once at least…You should have let her explain,
[32:41] should have let her speak.
[32:42] You did not listen to her at all.
[32:44] You should have believed in whatever
she would have had said…
[32:46] After that you could have scolded
her as much as you wanted…
[32:49] You could have killed her.
[32:50] You should have listened to her once at least,
to know what she has to say.
[32:53] What did you do? You destroyed everything,
you ruined everything
[32:58] You buried your own joys, along with the cat.
[33:02] What did you do? What did you do?
[33:06] What did you do? you fool, what did you do?
[33:14] Stay away…Just stay away…we have been
ruined; we have been destroyed.
[33:26] Let’s go.
[33:29] Let’s go.
[33:31] Nothing has happened.
[33:33] She is forbidden for you….Leave her hand.
[33:36] I said, leave her hand.
[33:41] Mother, what is wrong with you?
[33:42] I said it out of anger.
[33:44] Does someone give a divorce out of love too?
[33:47] Ok, I will give charity Mother…
What is wrong with you?
[33:50] There is no room for adjustments in Islamic laws.
[33:54] Mother, God is the witness, I was
not in my senses at that time.
[33:58] This is not your political statement…
[34:01] Which you can change the next day.
[34:03] It is not your government but
it’s about the rules of God.
[34:06] Ok, it’s between me and my God, ok?
[34:08] Ok fine.
[34:09] Then I cannot stay under the same roof.
[34:12] Then go and drop her at her place.
[34:18] Don’t let him hold your hand.
[34:21] God will curse you.
[34:31] The divorce has been done.
[34:36] There is no doubt about it.
[34:41] Seeking any excuse in this regard…
[34:45] Is against the Islamic laws.
[34:50] Neither
[34:51] charity,
[34:52] alms…
[34:54] Nor repentance…
[34:57] Can invalidate this.
[35:03] That woman…
[35:06] Is no longer bound by your marriage.
[35:10] Sir!
[35:12] You are like our family member.
[35:18] The entire situation is before you,
you know about everything.
[35:21] The ups and downs of our house, the problems…
[35:25] Everything…and…
[35:27] You know
[35:28] about his nature too.
[35:30] You are aware of our honor as well.
[35:33] Being our own, give us an advice
which could resolve this matter.
[35:43] God says…
[35:47] That if a husband gives a divorce, then she…
[35:50] That is the woman…
[35:53] Will not be lawful for that man…
[35:57] Until…
[35:59] She marries another man.
[36:03] Then, if he…
[36:05] that is the second husband…
[36:07] If he divorces her…
[36:10] There is no sin on either,
if they come back together…
[36:14] And remarry…
[36:16] Provided they believe they will uphold God's limits.
[36:24] And all of this…
[36:26] is part of God's boundaries…
[36:29] Which He makes clear for those…
[36:33] Who understand.
