[01:41] I have come to ask about Ibrahim, why have you arrested him?
[01:46] What is your relation with him?
[01:49] He is my husband.
[01:51] According to our information, he is unmarried.
[01:56] What’s his crime?
[02:20] Aliya!
[02:25] Aliya, I beg of you.
[02:27] Shabbir!
[02:29] I beg you.
[02:31] For God’s sake, forgive me, I have made a very big mistake.
[02:33] Shabbir, someone is coming.
[02:34] Sit up.
[02:34] I will be thankful to you.
[02:35] Shabbir, sit on the chair.
[02:36] I made a very big mistake, forgive me.
[02:36] Ok, sit on the chair.
[02:38] Sit on the chair.
[02:41] Come, let’s go home.
[02:42] Come, please, let’s go home.
[02:44] I will not go without Ibrahim.
[02:50] I know…
[02:53] You are protecting that beggar from me.
[02:55] I can understand.
[02:59] I forgot about that matter, I forgave him, leave it.
[03:05] I have found you, what else do I need?
[03:07] Just…
[03:09] don’t go beyond that Aliya.
[03:12] There is destruction beyond that, there is no way back.
[03:16] You and that beggar are a noose around my neck, you will ruin everything.
[03:20] You…
[03:21] You…
[03:23] wanted to live like a maid in the house, right?
[03:26] To hell with that.
[03:27] You continue living like the lady of the house.
[03:28] No Shabbir, I have not come for you, Shabbir!
[03:30] You just come home.
[03:30] Shabbir, I have come for Ibrahim.
[03:31] Shabbir, leave my hand.
[03:35] I don’t want anyone other than Ibrahim.
[03:40] I just want Ibrahim.
[03:55] What is your relation with him?
[03:57] Hmm?
[03:59] What is your relation with him?
[03:59] Is this you asking me?
[04:01] Don’t you know my relation with him?
[04:02] I have folded my hands before you, apologized to you.
[04:05] For God’s sake forgive me.
[04:07] Don’t torture me any further.
[04:09] And it won't be just me asking; everyone will ask you, what proof do you have?
[04:43] Are you done reading?
[04:47] And the proof of the divorce…
[04:49] Anita must have sent you its video.
[05:08] Oh!
[05:16] Are you…
[05:20] Involved with Chaudry Zubair in this conspiracy?
[05:24] Tell me?
[05:27] Yes, it’s my conspiracy.
[05:30] I am doing all this.
[05:32] First, I got myself divorced…
[05:35] Then I got married to Ibrahim forcefully.
[05:38] Now, I am provoking you with this proof of marriage and divorce.
[05:40] You are not getting it.
[05:42] You are not getting what Chaudry Zubair is doing with us.
[05:46] What big game is he playing.
[05:47] He is making you stand against me so that we both get destroyed.
[05:51] No one will get anything from this…
[05:53] Except for humiliation, we will get nothing.
[05:56] I have got what I wanted.
[05:58] Now, you deal with your own matters.
[06:03] Great!
[06:07] Mother was right.
[06:11] Seems like that beggar has casted a spell on you.
[06:15] You are even talking like him.
[06:20] Yes, he has casted a spell on me.
[06:23] He has really casted a spell on me, Shabbir.
[06:27] And I will not come out of his spell now.
[06:37] Wow! Great!
[06:39] Very good!
[06:43] You have chosen a very good place.
[06:46] Its great pleasure.
[06:48] I met my ex-girlfriend right here for the first time.
[06:56] Get up, you have a visitor.
[07:10] Ibrahim!
[07:17] Are you ok?
[07:19] Are you ok?
[07:21] I hope no one has harmed you.
[07:22] Why have you come?
[07:24] Tell me, if someone has harmed you.
[07:26] You should not have come here Aliya Madam.
[07:28] You…
[07:29] I hope no one has misbehaved with you.
[07:30] First answer me…Has someone harmed you?
[07:33] You should not have had come here.
[07:34] Please, answer me, has someone harmed you or not?
[07:38] Shabbir…
[07:39] Did he raise his hand on you?
[07:41] He is going crazy for you.
[07:43] You should not have had come, if he sees you, he will kidnap you.
[07:45] He is not that daring.
[07:47] Aliya Madam!
[07:48] For God’s sake, go from here, this place is not suitable for you.
[07:51] Where should I go?
[07:52] How should I go?
[07:53] I will not go without you.
[07:55] I will come back, I can understand the ways now.
[07:57] This is not a mosque from where you will come back to me.
[08:00] Do you always have to have it your way?
[08:01] No.
[08:03] I am agreeing with you.
[08:05] You can’t live without me, right?
[08:06] You can’t live without me at all, right?
[08:07] Aliya Madam, I can.
[08:09] I can even bear the distance…
[08:11] For the sake of your respect and honor.
[08:13] You go from here.
[08:17] This is our fight.
[08:19] We will fight it together.
[08:29] Mr. Chaudhry, are you aware that till date…
[08:33] What have I held a grudge against you?
[08:41] For the slap…
[08:44] Which Senior Mr. Chaudry gave me.
[08:50] My ball spilled the tea on the table.
[08:56] Lick it!
[09:01] Lick this!
[09:05] Senior Mr. Chaudry said this.
[09:10] You were riding your cycle nearby.
[09:25] Today…
[09:30] After so many years…
[09:39] I am ready to lick that same tea.
[09:48] Just don’t give me another slap.
[09:57] I will declare my inclusion in your party along with all my party members.
[10:05] Without any condition…
[10:09] You in the forefront…
[10:11] And I will follow you.
[10:16] I will raise slogans in your name as well.
[10:20] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[10:27] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[10:42] So…
[10:44] Is the meeting over?
[10:45] Huh?
[10:47] See, we have kept him with great love up till now.
[10:50] Tea, refreshment, food…
[10:52] You may ask him.
[10:54] Yes, thank you!
[10:57] Untie his hands, he will not run away.
[11:00] Where will he run to?
[11:02] And as long as he is sitting here…
[11:05] You also are not going anywhere.
[11:08] I am joking.
[11:10] I will talk to Chaudry Zubair’s wife…
[11:14] She will definitely take her complaint back.
[11:18] There is no need to go anywhere.
[11:20] There is no need for any reference.
[11:23] We are already releasing him tomorrow.
[11:25] There is just a minor paper work left.
[11:29] And we will get the handcuffs unlocked too.
[11:31] Mudassir!
[11:33] Unlock Mr. Ibrahim’s hand cuffs buddy.
[11:37] And get his face washed.
[11:40] Don’t worry…its just a matter of tonight.
[11:42] We will release him.
[11:58] Wow!
[12:00] You both are looking very good together.
[12:03] Make some Tik tok.
[12:04] Ok?
[12:05] Come on, go out.
[12:09] And shut the door.
[12:11] And listen, no one should come in.
[12:17] Come on, both of you, sit here.
[12:24] Didn’t you hear me?
[12:26] Come and sit here.
[12:39] Yes…
[12:41] Remove this, please.
[12:47] Madam, remove this, hurry up, we don’t have that much time.
[12:51] Why are you making a video?
[12:54] I can even file a case against you under Hudood Ordinance.
[12:58] Do you know what is Hudood Ordinance?
[13:00] Are you aware of it?
[13:04] Illegitimate relationships.
[13:07] Speak cautiously, Sir!
[13:10] She is my wife.
[13:12] Stop talking rubbish.
[13:14] I know whose wife is she.
[13:16] Shabbir has divorced me.
[13:18] Really?
[13:19] I swear upon God.
[13:20] Why?
[13:21] Why has he divorced you?
[13:23] Because of Chaudry Zubair.
[13:26] So, you have ties with Chaudry Zubair too.
[13:28] Sir, I said…
[13:31] Be careful when you speak, she is my wife.
[13:32] I had no relations with him.
[13:34] I have a relation with his wife.
[13:36] She is my friend.
[13:38] I went to her house one day…
[13:39] Tell the truth Madam, don’t make stories.
[13:42] I am telling you the truth, Sir.
[13:43] You want me to beat him up in front of you, right?
[13:47] Bring the Holy Book, if you have, I can take an oath on that.
[13:51] The truth is that he used to visit Chaudry Shabbir.
[13:56] There you both started an affair…
[13:58] And he ran away with you.
[14:01] No.
[14:02] The truth is that Shabbir himself has got me married to him.
[14:05] Why would he get his wife married to someone, do you think we are fools?
[14:08] For the sake of remarrying.
[14:10] Now he wants me to take a divorce from him and remarry him.
[14:18] Ok!
[14:21] So, this is the story.
[14:23] It’s a great mess.
[14:27] It’s a very interesting story.
[14:30] Ok, narrate this story then.
[14:33] Shabbir should be narrating this story.
[14:35] If you will narrate it…
[14:37] Then he will also narrate.
[14:39] I will not narrate like this.
[14:41] Really?
[14:42] How will you narrate then?
[14:44] Tell me.
[14:55] Sir, Shabbir divorced me due to his enmity with Zubair.
[14:59] Now Zubair wants to use this divorce against Shabbir in enmity.
[15:04] What is my fault in all this?
[15:07] Why am I suffering in their politics?
[15:15] If you think that Shabbir can gain a few extra votes by exposing me, then its ok.
[15:22] Make my video.
[15:25] Show my helplessness to the world.
[15:39] Yes, whatever goods that boy has stolen…
[15:42] Shabbir will compensate for that loss.
[15:46] Yes…I take my complaint back.
[15:48] Let him go, set him free.
[15:52] Let’s discuss the rest, when we meet.
[15:54] Thanks a lot.
[15:56] Whatever trouble you both have been through…
[15:58] I apologize for that.
[16:01] No problem, Sir.
[16:03] It’s not your fault.
[16:05] This is their politics.
[16:08] Whoever is in authority…
[16:09] He humiliates the other publicly.
[16:15] At the moment, I think…
[16:17] At the moment, I think…
[16:19] They have joined each other.
[16:22] And this is more dangerous for both of you.
[16:26] Shabbir has got the freedom and…
[16:29] He can do anything.
[16:31] Now, it’s very dangerous for both of you to live there.
[16:37] My men have seen that place and…
[16:40] Anyone of them will reveal it before him.
[16:44] The car is ready, Sir.
[16:47] OK.
[16:48] Mudassir will get you a bus.
[16:51] Take care of yourselves beyond that.
[16:54] I have to visit a check post.
[16:56] I shall leave.
[16:57] Thank you, thanks a lot.
[17:06] And yes…
[17:07] Ibrahim…
[17:09] You sing very well buddy.
[17:11] Keep singing.
[17:23] Aliya Madam!
[17:28] We are not going to the hostel.
[17:30] We will have to go once at least.
[17:32] We will get our luggage from there and then move ahead.
[17:36] For how long will we run like this?
[17:40] I am tired.
[17:43] I also want to lead a life without embarrassment and fear, holding your hand.
[17:50] That’s true but there is no other way out.
[17:52] There is.
[17:54] Let’s stand before them.
[17:57] If we will run like this secretly, they will twist this matter into something else, you know that, right?
[18:01] You can understand this, right?
[18:04] Hmm, I do understand but I don’t care at all.
[18:06] I do care this time.
[18:09] Ibrahim, he will kill you.
[18:10] Let him kill me, I don’t care, there is nothing more important for me than your honor.
[18:15] I don’t know, what are you talking about, let’s go…
[18:17] Aliya Madam, I have agreed with everything you have said without asking any questions.
[18:20] This time, you will listen to me.
[18:21] We will go to the mosque to Cleric Sir.
[18:26] Trust me.
[18:44] My Dear Son!
[18:46] You should take it…
[18:48] As there was some divine purpose behind this.
[18:53] He had to end your enmity like this only.
[18:58] And women are not a problem.
[19:01] They keep coming and going in men’s lives…
[19:04] Like a shoe.
[19:06] If a shoe starts hurting, one can change it.
[19:10] And if you like…
[19:12] You can keep even two and three.
[19:16] When your own shoe hits on your head, Mother…
[19:21] It hurts a lot.
[19:28] You did not see her eyes.
[19:34] That beggar was shining in them.
[19:39] She was talking like him.
[19:42] Forget her.
[19:43] She deserved it.
[19:45] She was worth that beggar only.
[19:47] It was you who picked her from the ground and made her sit on the throne.
[19:50] Did she deserve it?
[19:52] Neither was she pretty or beautiful, nor she held any character.
[19:57] Now you see…
[20:00] The kind of a girl I will bring for you.
[20:04] Let me burry her first.
[20:06] I have already buried her, I have totally buried her.
[20:11] I will spread the news of her being infertile all around…
[20:14] I will make sure, everyone gets to know about.
[20:18] And that boy…
[20:20] He will get lost along with the charity box.
[20:27] Do you know…
[20:29] No one even curses the Muezzin, if he turns out to be a thief.
[21:06] Why have you come here?
[21:16] To leave honorably.
[21:17] Because I ran away earlier.
[21:20] Who will bring your wedding procession?
[21:24] You.
[21:26] You will bring it, right?
[21:29] Get out from here.
[21:31] Leave, I am telling you.
[21:32] Before Shabbir’s anger burn you to ashes, run away from here.
[21:36] We will not leave.
[21:44] Ask Mr. Chaudry…
[21:45] To announce the divorce after the night prayers.
[21:50] Such a bold statement…
[21:54] Doesn’t suit coming from someone like you.
[21:59] Mother, it is not about me.
[22:02] It is God and his Prophet’s saying.
[22:07] OK.
[22:09] Should I also distribute sweets for your marriage after this?
[22:20] That’s our personal matter, we will deal with that.
[22:22] Stop talking rubbish.
[22:24] Both of you leave from here quietly.
[22:26] I am giving you this much privilege, consider this enough.
[22:28] We will leave, once the divorce is announced.
[22:31] You wanted this traitor, right?
[22:34] Ye got him out of the lock up and handed him over to you.
[22:37] He surrendered his politics to his enemy… to Chaudry Zubair.
[22:42] Oh, you fool, think about his prestige a little.
[22:45] I am regarding his prestige.
[22:47] This is why I want him to announce the divorce himself.
[22:50] He will be badly insulted, if I announce it.
[22:53] He will be left with nothing.
[23:04] So, Chaudry Shabbir!
[23:06] Is everything alright?
[23:09] I hope you have not changed your mind.
[23:14] No, Mr. Chaudry.
[23:20] I have actually come to lick tha table today, on which I had once spilled tea.
[23:26] Huh!
[23:29] What are you saying?
[23:31] You don’t believe verbal statements otherwise.
[23:35] Why did you feel so?
[23:41] You set both of them free from the police station and settled them in the mosque.
[23:49] Mosque?
[23:51] She is asking me to announce it.
[23:55] Before all the worshippers in the mosque.
[24:00] So, do you cook food yourself now?
[24:04] Yes, dear…
[24:05] Since you guys have left…
[24:07] I somehow manage to cook on my own.
[24:09] Have they stopped sending you food as well?
[24:12] No, dear
[24:14] I have stopped it myself.
[24:16] Why?
[24:20] A leader of the mosque should do it on his own.
[24:23] So that someone else’s favor…
[24:26] Does not become a reason of hinderance in speaking the truth.
[24:36] How do you earn?
[24:37] I have started doing a job at a place after morning till evening prayers.
[24:41] I look after the administration there.
[24:48] I also have learnt a lot from her.
[24:52] I can cook vegetables.
[24:54] God bless!
[24:56] He has learnt cooking but he has not yet learnt to eat.
[25:00] He takes it from others share as well.
[25:02] Especially, when there is sweet dish.
[25:05] Especially, carrot pudding.
[25:11] Greetings Madam!
[25:13] They being together in the mosque…
[25:16] Is a big question within itself.
[25:20] Even if they don’t say anything to anyone.
[25:23] You will have to prepare an answer for it.
[25:27] A stinging reply.
[25:30] I mean, your narrative.
[25:33] I hope you understand the meaning of narrative.
[25:36] A fabricated story.
[25:39] A tale so big and powerful…
[25:42] That it leaves all the other stories in silence.
[25:51] Yes, Bunty.
[25:53] What are you doing in the mosque?
[25:56] I am about to cook at the moment, why?
[25:58] Have you gone mad?
[25:59] Get out of there.
[26:00] They both are sitting here together.
[26:03] God knows, what will they do with you?
[26:05] What will they do?
[26:07] Shabbir’s anger…and Zubair’s conspiracy…
[26:09] If they get together, what could happen?
[26:12] Think about it yourself.
[26:17] Bunty, I have left everything over to God.
[26:20] I am sitting in His house.
[26:22] Whether its honor or disgrace…it’s up to Him.
[26:30] Go Noora!
[27:02] What did he say?
[27:05] He has dug a grave.
[27:11] One of us has to get buried.
[27:16] Either me or Aliya.
[27:26] The decision is yours.
[27:49] Why are you guys so astonished?
[27:51] No.
[27:52] Don’t get astonished.
[27:54] Brothers do fight with each other.
[27:57] Sometimes over wealth, sometimes property, sometimes politics.
[28:02] But self-respect is mutual for brothers.
[28:09] This shamelessness…
[28:11] Is even a disgusting disease then corona.
[28:14] Once, it starts spreading, it keeps spreading.
[28:16] From one person to another…
[28:19] From one house to another house…
[28:21] It keeps spreading, it keeps spreading.
[28:28] What I have come here to talk about…
[28:32] Though it is very serious and bitter.
[28:35] Imagine, it’s so bitter and serious…
[28:38] That these two young men…
[28:40] Who raise slogans in rallies and processions…
[28:43] Even they can’t say it.
[28:46] They have brought me…
[28:47] Saying that Mother you talk about it.
[28:53] So, be courageous now.
[28:55] And listen!
[28:57] This mosque of yours…
[29:00] Where you and us, offer prayers five times a day…
[29:04] Where we cry and bow down before God, ask for forgiveness…
[29:09] Today, shamelessness has taken refuge in that mosque.
[29:17] We…
[29:19] We had considered it a relationship as of a Sister in law and a Brother in law.
[29:21] I swear, we had never even doubted.
[29:28] I have seen it myself.
[29:32] But I did not tell anything to my Shabbir.
[29:34] I said, no…
[29:36] He is very aggressive by nature, he will ruin everything.
[29:38] Yes…
[29:39] I explained it to my Daughter in law.
[29:41] I put strict restrictions on her.
[29:44] But all in vain.
[29:47] It is said that…
[29:48] When one becomes shameless…
[29:51] When one loses all sense of decency…
[29:53] Then one becomes blind.
[29:57] No restriction could stop her.
[29:59] She jumped over all restriction and ran away with him.
[30:04] Yours, mine, charity…she ran away with all of it.
[30:11] The girl was illiterate…
[30:13] She was uneducated, we could say that but…
[30:15] The boy…
[30:16] Imagine, he was so religious, a prayer caller.
[30:20] Neither could he see the Holy Book, nor the religious laws.
[30:23] He went blind due to shamelessness.
[30:26] And not only this…
[30:28] This is not enough, look at this.
[30:30] He got married to her, got married.
[30:53] You have changed so much.
[30:56] I am amazed when I look at you.
[31:00] This is not the same Ibrahim.
[31:03] This is all thanks to your brilliance.
[31:09] The fear of losing someone makes one weak…
[31:14] And brave too.
[31:18] I had nothing.
[31:28] Ever since I have found you…
[31:32] I have started feeling more respectable in myself.
[31:39] This is why neither did I feel nervous in the police station…
[31:43] Nor did my tongue tremble before Mother.
[31:47] Anything can happen.
[31:50] I am aware of Shabbir’s temperament.
[31:53] He can go to any extent.
[31:55] Don’t you worry.
[31:58] I will not let any harm come to you.
[32:01] I will die myself, but I will not let any harm come to you.
[32:06] Why do you think of me apart from yourself?
[32:12] If we are to live, we will live together…
[32:15] If we are to die, we will die together.
[32:22] I am helpless.
[32:28] I can’t think of your death…
[32:34] Even if it’s with me.
[32:47] Stop it! Stop it!
[32:49] Put an end to this shamelessness!
[32:50] Stop it! Stop it!
[32:52] Put an end to this shamelessness!
[32:53] Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
[32:55] Restore! Restore!
[32:57] Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
[32:59] Restore! Restore!
[33:00] Bring them out!
[33:02] Bring the shameless out!
[33:04] Bring them out!
[33:05] Bring the shameless out!
[33:07] Stop it! Stop it!
[33:08] Stop the indecency!
[33:10] Stop it! Stop it!
[33:11] Stop the indecency!
[33:13] Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
[33:15] Restore! Restore!
[33:17] Restore the sanctity of the mosque!
[33:18] Restore! Restore!
[33:20] Please, show respect for the mosque’s sanctity.
[33:22] It’s the sanctity that we have come to restore, Cleric Sir.
[33:24] For 25 years…
[33:27] I have been watching over this mosque.
[33:31] And you…
[33:32] have become the watchmen in just a single day.
[33:34] Shameless and immoral people have come here, Cleric Sir.
[33:38] You have come here to tell this to me?
[33:40] These two have entered into a marriage upon marriage, Cleric Sir.
[33:42] They deserve to die.
[33:44] Yes, Cleric Sir.
[33:46] Who are you to decide?
[33:48] This is our mutual decision.
[33:52] Look at their deeds, Cleric Sir.
[33:54] They have entered into a marriage upon marriage.
[33:56] Wait!
[33:58] Wait!
[33:59] If they have committed a major sin…
[34:03] Then I will be the first on to throw a stone at them.
[34:08] First…A court will be set.
[34:11] But…
[34:13] before that…
[34:15] Any step…
[34:17] Is illegal…and UnIslamic.
[34:20] Found them, found them.
[34:22] Found the culprits.
[34:23] Found the culprits.
[34:25] Found the culprits, found the culprits, found them.
[34:28] Found the culprits, found them.
[34:30] Found the culprits, found them.
[34:33] Move back! Move back!
[34:35] Move back! Move back!
[34:37] Move!
[34:40] Move!
[34:41] Leave them!
[34:43] The court will decide about them, move back.
[34:44] Move back!
[34:47] Move back!
[35:05] I swear upon the Holy Book…
[35:10] Which is the guide and the light.
[35:13] I swear by the prostrations taking place in this mosque…
[35:17] Aliya and Ibrahim’s marriage…
[35:21] Was conducted in this place of prostration.
[35:25] I am the officiant of this marriage myself…
[35:28] And among the witnesses were…
[35:30] Chaudry Shabbir and her honorable Mother…Herself.
[35:38] On January 13, 2024…
[35:41] In a state of anger…
[35:43] Chaudhry Shabbir to his wife, Lady Aliya…
[35:49] With his political opponent…
[35:51] Chaudhry Zubair Ahmad’s wife…
[35:54] Due to their friendship…
[35:56] Divorced her.
[35:58] Chaudry Shabbir…
[36:00] Was guilty on his act…
[36:03] And…on 24th April, 2024…
[36:08] After completing the waiting period…
[36:11] Lady Aliya and Ibrahim’s were married in the same mosque…
[36:17] Before Chaudry Shabbir.
[36:20] The reason was…that Ibrahim…
[36:24] After getting married…
[36:26] Divorces his wife, Aliya…
[36:30] Will pave the way for Chaudry Shabbir for remarriage.
[36:35] Listen carefully!
[36:37] Listen carefully!
[36:39] Any marriage…
[36:43] Or a divorce after that…
[36:45] Is done with the intention of remarrying…
[36:48] Then according to the teachings of God, and his Prophet, Peace be upon him…
[37:00] Is an undesirable deed.
[37:02] Therefore, Ibrahim and Aliya…
[37:06] Both refused to it.
[37:09] And due to Chaudry Shabbir’s rage and anger…
[37:11] And fear of his power and authority…
[37:13] They disappeared.
[37:15] And today…
[37:16] Approximately after 2 months…
[37:19] For his marriage…
[37:21] And
[37:23] announcement of the divorce…
[37:25] Which is exactly according to the Islamic laws…
[37:28] Came and settled in the mosque.
[37:31] And put forward their demand to Chaudry Shabbir.
[37:36] But Chaudry Shabbir…
[37:39] Prioritized his honor over the religious laws.
[37:44] And by providing false statements to all of you…
[37:48] Provoked all of you.
[37:51] Now whoever…
[37:54] Doubts my truthfulness…
[37:56] Or he thinks…
[37:59] That I used false statements from the sacred pulpit…
[38:06] Then they may stone this sacred bond.
[38:13] Whoever thinks…
[38:16] That I have…led you with honesty…
[38:22] Give you teachings of justice and truth…
[38:25] They may go to Chaudry Shabbir…
[38:28] And question him about his false statements.
[38:33] Surely, I am also equally a part of this sin.
[38:38] And I am ready for the punishment.
[38:41] This is why…
[38:44] For disrespecting the mosque…
[38:47] The first punishment…
[38:49] Should be given to me.
