[01:42] You should treat him like a student or an assistant,
[01:46] which is his rightful place.
[01:47] He will understand all the ways in a single day
[01:50] and he will become mature too.
[01:52] Can’t you see the danger I am facing?
[01:55] I can see that but you also become brave.
[02:28] I have to leave early in the morning.
[02:30] I came to take my black suit.
[02:32] If its not pressed then give it to me, I’ll do it myself.
[02:34] No, no, I had pressed it.
[02:43] Here you go.
[02:46] You keep him close to you all day long.
[02:48] And you make the poor soul sleep on the floor at this time.
[03:19] Forget about what others are saying…
[03:21] And talking about.
[03:22] Focus on what you want.
[03:25] And most importantly, what does he want?
[03:27] What would that poor man can desire for?
[03:29] This the problem that you think of him as helpless.
[03:32] He doesn’t even take my name.
[03:34] He starts shivering if he tries to become informal.
[03:37] There is a lot of distance between us.
[03:39] Do you want to end this distance?
[03:45] Buddy, I just want to live with him…
[03:48] No matter how he chooses to live with me.
[03:50] Then tell him about this.
[03:52] The poor man thinks that you will be ok without him, nothing will happen to you.
[03:55] Tell him this, it’s important.
[04:05] You take a day off tomorrow.
[04:08] Forget it, I will talk to Aunty myself.
[04:10] Ok?
[04:19] Come…Sit, sit.
[04:23] Have a seat, please.
[04:24] You please, sit down.
[04:25] No, no, please sit.
[04:26] No, no, I will not sit.
[04:26] Look, there are couples all around, please, have a seat. Please.
[04:30] Sit.
[04:32] Look, its valentine’s day.
[04:34] Everyone expresses their inner most feelings.
[04:37] You two also have to share your feelings.
[04:39] Ok?
[04:40] OK.
[04:41] I am standing right at the gate, I will not let you go, if you guys don’t talk.
[04:44] And I will order food for both of you.
[04:46] Ok?
[04:47] Ok…and what about you?
[04:49] I also have someone.
[04:51] You have to talk.
[04:52] OK.
[04:54] Huh!
[05:33] Say something, please.
[05:37] First, you speak, tell me something about yourself.
[05:44] Once, liked a girl.
[05:49] Nomads, they were shepherds.
[05:54] Every year, during the summers…
[05:58] She used to come along with her cattle.
[06:04] I used to wait for her.
[06:07] Do you miss her?
[06:09] Boys were scared of me.
[06:12] She being a girl, dared to confront me.
[06:16] So…
[06:18] Do you like girls who are always fighting?
[06:21] Ibrahim, there are so many aggressive girls in our hostel as well.
[06:24] Bushra…
[06:26] Umm…Salma, Naureen.
[06:29] Which one do you like?
[06:30] Aliya.
[06:38] I like Aliya Madam.
[06:49] Do you find me aggressive?
[06:54] No.
[06:59] You look brave.
[07:02] The one who fights for herself.
[07:16] So…actually…
[07:21] Did you have a love marriage?
[07:24] No, no…no.
[07:30] Ibrahim, I truly fell in love with just one man.
[07:33] With whom?
[07:37] My Father.
[07:39] He was a very nice man.
[07:43] My marriage with Shabbir was arranged.
[07:48] When Fathers die, sisters become a burden on brothers.
[07:52] Yes.
[07:57] Yes, but Shabbir says that he fell in love with me.
[08:04] Anita sister has brought us to a good place.
[08:11] Happy valentines.
[08:14] Bunty!
[08:14] Keep sitting, keep sitting.
[08:15] You must have been tired…after a long shopping.
[08:18] And…what have you bought for Shabbir today?
[08:22] You are roaming around with his measurement.
[08:24] Keep sitting brother, keep sitting, keep sitting.
[08:27] I have also come here to celebrate valentines.
[08:30] And tell me something…
[08:31] Couldn’t you refuse to me personally?
[08:33] If you did not want to meet me then you should have said it clearly.
[08:36] Why did you make me confront that old lady?
[08:38] And I am not interested in meeting you.
[08:40] It was actually Bubbly who was repeatedly mentioning you and wanted to meet you…
[08:43] Before leaving.
[08:44] Where did bubbly go?
[08:46] America…
[08:47] Breast cancer.
[08:48] God knows, if she comes back or not.
[08:51] Anyways…
[08:52] You celebrate valentines.
[08:53] Why would you care?
[08:54] I shall go.
[09:07] I met Aliya yesterday.
[09:08] Hmm.
[09:09] Which secret place?
[09:12] She was celebrating valentines.
[09:13] Wow! Great!
[09:15] Mr. Chaudry is having fun.
[09:17] She was with someone else.
[09:22] No way.
[09:25] I used to idealize this girl a lot.
[09:28] She turned out to be so cheap.
[09:32] Who was the man?
[09:34] I can’t believe it.
[09:36] Tell me.
[09:39] He is the Muezzin in his mosque.
[09:42] Look at her standards.
[09:45] Do you know him?
[09:47] She used to roam around with him…
[09:48] Making an excuse of shopping for Shabbir.
[09:53] Aaa.
[09:55] Shabbir has made a big issue of this.
[09:57] He has filed a report against him.
[09:59] Obviously…
[10:00] There will be an issue.
[10:01] He is not blind.
[10:07] All tasks will be carried out in the same way.
[10:09] Cleaning, tidying up, maintenance, cooking.
[10:13] And laundry will be fifty, fifty.
[10:15] Food and accommodation are free.
[10:17] Now you decide the salary.
[10:28] You decide, we don’t know, whatever is fine with you.
[10:32] We have thought of 25000.
[10:35] 25 each?
[10:37] No, no…we count both of you as one.
[10:39] Both of you work together, right?
[10:47] Ok, forget it.
[10:49] With his assistance….
[10:50] I will give you 5000 more.
[10:53] I can’t increase more than this.
[10:55] Ok?
[10:57] Come on get up, start working, there is a lot to do.
[11:01] Come on, get up.
[11:03] Come on, get started, get started.
[11:20] Greetings Mr. Chaudry!
[11:21] Greetings Mr. Butt!
[11:24] So, Mr. Butt, did someone offer you any cooldrinks?
[11:27] No, no, Mr. Chaudry, there is no need.
[11:29] I am in a rush.
[11:30] Tell me, why did you call me?
[11:32] Buddy…what’s the Muezzin’s issue?
[11:37] I don’t know, Mr. Chaudry…
[11:39] But it seems like pointless political ploy.
[11:43] Otherwise, how much money could there be in the charity box?
[11:46] This much money is spent, if two people go out for a meal.
[11:50] He would have had spent it by now, how will we recover it?
[11:54] No, no, Mr. SHO.
[11:55] The matter is serious.
[11:57] Your special attention is required in this case.
[12:01] I think, that boy has runaway with some other valuables too.
[12:18] Tea is good.
[12:20] Yes.
[12:20] Dusting, cleaning, mopping, he does everything very well.
[12:26] Do you know how to make coffee?
[12:30] No.
[12:32] He doesn’t know how to make coffee but he doesn’t know how to steal as well.
[12:35] Nothing will go missing from the kitchen to the cabin.
[12:38] And if it does then I will be responsible.
[12:40] It’s my personal guarantee.
[12:43] Hmm.
[12:47] Done!
[12:49] Thank you!
[12:50] Let’s go.
[13:00] Aliya Madam!
[13:01] Aliya…
[13:02] Leave everything and have sweet.
[13:04] For what?
[13:04] Have it and then I will tell you.
[13:08] Oho!
[13:09] May I feed you?
[13:16] Actually…I have got a job.
[13:21] Where?
[13:21] At Anita Sister’s office.
[13:23] Day and night duty for five days…Two days off.
[13:26] Salary is 40,000.
[13:34] Aliya Madam, didn’t you like it?
[13:38] Telling me about groceries, did you go to find a job with her?
[13:41] Oh no, it was Anita Sister’s idea, she asked me.
[13:44] Don’t lie.
[13:46] Aliya Madam, I don’t lie.
[13:48] What is it then if it’s not a lie?
[13:50] You leave for something else and you return doing something else.
[13:52] It’s is a lie, right?
[13:53] Don’t try to fool me.
[13:58] Aliya Madam, you are taking it wrong, I haven’t...
[13:59] Ibrahim, leave from here at the moment.
[14:05] Go, I am working, distribute the sweet among the others.
[14:12] OK.
[14:27] How can he do this?
[14:29] He is bound with us.
[14:30] He has signed an agreement.
[14:32] Show me his agreement.
[14:33] Verbal commitment holds some value.
[14:36] Aunty, innocent people have no language.
[14:38] And by the way, Aliya is your employee.
[14:40] You are getting Ibrahim for free anyways.
[14:42] Ok then he may take Aliya along.
[14:45] We don’t need them.
[14:46] Think about it, Uncle.
[14:47] Aunty, Ibrahim, is getting a package worth 40,000, they both will manage very easily in that.
[14:53] Its you, who will be in trouble.
[14:55] Will you get someone like Aliya in that money?
[14:57] Think about it.
[14:58] Ok, ok.
[15:00] If Aliya can do it then ask her to carry on.
[15:03] OK.
[15:09] I have talked to them, they have no objection.
[15:19] I do have an objection.
[15:20] Bushra is right, you will never let him out of your reach.
[15:23] Yesterday, you were talking about reducing the distance and today you are increasing it.
[15:26] Oh Aliya, let him meet himself first, only then he will be able to meet you.
[15:30] You are worth 25000 and he is worth 5000, who is a good for nothing for you.
[15:34] Where would he gain his confidence from?
[15:36] How will he stand by you?
[15:37] Buddy, he can’t manage alone, he is very innocent.
[15:41] Stop it, stop talking rubbish, buddy.
[15:45] You can’t get over your high stance of being Mrs. Chaudry.
[15:48] You want a man, whom you can support.
[16:19] I don’t lie, Aliya Madam.
[16:24] I have never lied to you.
[16:28] I know, Ibrahim.
[16:36] Why did you fight with me then?
[16:39] You got upset for no reason.
[16:41] No.
[16:42] I was not fighting with you but I was fighting with my own self.
[16:44] Honestly speaking, I can’t understand anything.
[16:47] Anita Sister said that you will be very happy when I will tell you, I had no idea that you will…
[16:52] You will get upset like this.
[16:54] How should I explain it to you man, you will not understand?
[16:57] Try to explain it, I will understand.
[17:01] Let me understand it myself first, Ibrahim.
[17:05] Aliya Madam!
[17:07] Look…I don’t even know how much is 40,000, how are they supposed to be spent,
[17:11] what can we buy with it?
[17:12] Anita Sister told me that you will be happy, I was doing it for you, that is enough for me.
[17:17] Things will go as per your wish.
[17:18] If you will say go to office, I will go to office,
[17:20] if you will ask me to keep sitting with you, I will stay with you all day long but…
[17:24] Things will happen as per your desire, you just…
[17:27] Don’t get upset with me.
[17:29] I don’t like it.
[17:54] Give it to me.
[18:05] I shall leave.
[18:09] Take care of yourself.
[18:13] You too.
[18:18] Bye!
[20:40] Ibrahim, give me the tester.
[20:43] Ibrahim!
[21:03] This…
[21:04] Did you do this?
[21:06] Yes.
[21:08] I went to the market with Anita…
[21:10] So, I bought it.
[21:11] It was there in your room, right?
[21:14] Did you like it?
[21:16] A lot.
[21:19] Aliya Madam!
[21:21] Thank you!
[21:22] I liked it very much.
[21:28] And this…
[21:29] This…
[21:31] This looks exactly like my village.
[21:32] Isn’t it?
[21:33] Yes, exactly.
[21:35] When I saw it, I also felt the same.
[21:37] Yes.
[21:39] Awesome!
[21:43] Ibrahim, where do you sleep over there?
[21:45] In the kitchen.
[21:47] On the floor?
[21:48] Yes, on the floor.
[21:50] I sleep well.
[21:52] Liar!
[21:53] No, no, honestly, you know, I am habitual of sleeping on the floor so, I sleep.
[21:56] Aaaa…
[21:57] Come here.
[21:58] Sit here.
[21:59] Sit.
[22:00] What are you doing?
[22:01] You will sleep here.
[22:02] Oh no, what are you talking about?
[22:04] Ibrahim sir, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:05] You sleep here.
[22:06] No, no.
[22:06] Sit.
[22:09] Aliya Madam, it will not look nice that you sleep on the floor and I sleep up here.
[22:11] I will not feel comfortable, I am used to it, you come here.
[22:13] Ibrahim!
[22:18] I also have become habitual.
[22:20] I have been sleeping here, since you left.
[22:23] I like it here.
[22:27] Really?
[22:39] Come.
[22:43] Greetings!
[22:45] Wow! Great!
[22:47] You look so change today.
[22:51] Ibrahim!
[22:52] You look like a gentleman.
[22:56] Thank you!
[22:58] You also look very nice.
[23:00] In fact, together, you both look very good.
[23:10] Actually…
[23:11] We needed a day off.
[23:15] Why?
[23:21] Actually…
[23:23] I am taking Aliya Madam out for dinner.
[23:26] Are you taking her out for dinner?
[23:31] Look, don’t lose him once again.
[23:34] It’s the only piece.
[23:39] No, I don’t need money.
[23:41] I have money.
[23:42] He has brought advance.
[23:48] Really?
[23:50] Ok…then go.
[23:53] Be happy and enjoy.
[23:55] Thank you!
[23:56] Bye!
[24:37] It’s a very nice place.
[24:38] How did you get to know about it?
[24:40] Actually…
[24:41] I came with Anila Madam.
[24:45] Who Anila?
[24:46] The one in the office.
[25:02] Aliya Madam!
[25:07] May I sing for you?
[25:11] Did you sing it for Anila as well?
[25:14] No, why would I sing for her?
[25:17] Then she must have sung one for you.
[25:19] No, why would she sing for me?
[25:22] Why did you come here then?
[25:24] To pick up food.
[25:26] She was getting married, so she had invited the office staff, that’s why I came.
[25:37] Ibrahim! Ibrahim!
[25:39] Go and sing now.
[25:41] May I go?
[25:41] Go.
[26:02] This song…
[26:04] Is Aliya Madam’s favorite that’s why it is for her.
[26:13] The word has reached Zubair.
[26:17] He has assigned personnel to find Ibrahim.
[26:20] And has given strict orders from the authorities as well.
[26:23] I will bring tea for you.
[26:24] Don’t handle me like a child.
[26:27] But you are my child.
[26:29] Mother!
[26:31] Mother!
[26:33] I feel like everybody has got to know.
[26:36] Everybody stares at me, Mother.
[26:38] Mother!
[26:39] Everybody is staring at me, Mother.
[26:41] Yes, everybody will look at you…
[26:43] Why wouldn’t they look at you?
[26:44] You are not an ordinary person.
[26:45] My status will become even lower than the ordinary, Mother.
[26:49] All my politics will be ruined, if Zubair get to know about it.
[26:53] Mother!
[26:54] Mother!
[26:56] Earlier, you were praying that she should be found.
[26:59] Now…now, please, you have to pray…
[27:03] That she doesn’t get caught by the police, Mother.
[27:05] Mother, will you?
[27:06] Mother!
[27:07] Sure, sure.
[27:08] Don’t you worry.
[27:09] Don’t worry, everything will be fine, don’t worry.
[27:12] Don’t worry, my child.
[27:14] Have patience.
[27:24] Ibrahim!
[27:25] Yes, Sir.
[27:28] Buddy, you can’t get a day off today.
[27:31] Pervaiz’s wife is very ill.
[27:34] He was pleading that…
[27:37] Ok?
[27:38] Sir…
[27:41] Aliya Madam must be waiting at home, I had told her that I will come, she will get upset.
[27:46] You will get paid for the overtime man.
[27:48] Two or two and half thousand cash.
[27:50] Give it to her when you go home.
[27:51] She will become happy.
[27:53] And we have a misunderstanding that they are missing us.
[27:58] Aliya Madam!
[27:59] What did you understand?
[28:01] Sir, but…
[28:03] You can’t get it man.
[28:05] Ok Sir.
[28:06] OK.
[28:19] Hmm.
[28:20] What special is being cooked for him today.
[28:22] Nothing.
[28:23] Why do you hide?
[28:25] You are the one, who hides.
[28:26] You made my entire film that day and you hid your valentine.
[28:30] I would have shown, if there would have been someone.
[28:32] Don’t talk rubbish.
[28:33] My favorite.
[28:35] I will give you only, if there is any left.
[28:36] All of it will be left today.
[28:38] It’s his favorite, he doesn’t leave it.
[28:40] I will give you, if there is some left.
[28:42] Your poor man is not coming today.
[28:43] He is working overtime on the weekend.
[28:45] I came to tell you this.
[28:56] Give this paper in the accounts department.
[28:58] Ok, Sir.
[29:05] Aliya Madam!
[29:08] You here?
[29:09] Have you come alone?
[29:13] This is Aliya Madam.
[29:15] She is my wife.
[29:16] Hello Mam’
[29:24] Is everything alright?
[29:26] No.
[29:30] Tell me, what has happened?
[29:36] Do you want to create a scene before the entire office here?
[29:45] Come inside…come.
[29:51] Come, come inside.
[30:03] What happened?
[30:06] Tell me, is everything alright?
[30:10] Aliya Madam, you look worried.
[30:21] Tell me, what has happened?
[30:24] Aliya Madam, you look very worried, tell me.
[30:26] Why would you care?
[30:29] You keep sitting in greed of a little money.
[30:33] I do care.
[30:33] what someone is going through, you have got nothing to do with that.
[30:37] No Aliya Madam, I am doing all this for you only.
[30:39] Are you doing it for me?
[30:41] What did I ask for Ibrahim?
[30:44] What did I ask for that you have become so greedy?
[30:48] What are you getting here that you keep me waiting there and completing your over time hours here?
[30:53] I thought that you…
[30:54] What are you getting which is more important and precious for you than me waiting?
[30:58] It’s nothing, I thought you will be happy that I am working.
[31:01] Will I be happy?
[31:03] I made a mistake.
[31:03] Ibrahim, I don’t want all this.
[31:06] I want nothing.
[31:08] I want you.
[31:13] I want you Ibrahim, can you understand?
[31:16] I can’t live without you, not even for a day or an hour or a minute.
[31:41] You have fever.
[31:49] Sit comfortably.
[31:51] Put your feet up.
[31:58] Here you go.
[32:07] Finish the water.
[33:45] Did you bring him last night?
[33:46] No.
[33:48] He brought me.
[33:50] He kept putting cold strips too all night long.
[33:52] Congratulations!
[33:53] He has been fired from his job.
[34:48] Hello!
[34:49] I have found Anita’s address, Brother.
[34:51] She works in some call center.
[35:20] You will rot in this dark cell all your life.
[35:25] And she will spend her entire life washing dishes...
[35:28] For a stranger.
[35:30] I have come to inquire about Ibrahim…
[35:32] Why have you arrested him?
[35:34] What is your relation with him?
[35:36] He is my husband.
[35:37] Oh, don’t do it.
[35:38] Oh! Oh! For God’s sake, don’t do it, brother.
[35:40] Stop it, brother, Oh! Oh! Don’t do it.
[35:42] Oh!
[35:43] Aaaa!
