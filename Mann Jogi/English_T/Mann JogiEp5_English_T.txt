[01:20] You can’t fight with Shabbir.
[01:22] There is nothing to fight about,
if he has divorced you then it’s over.
[01:25] Aliya’s Father was martyred
serving this place of worship.
[01:31] So, for his daughter…
[01:33] I can die.
[01:36] The rest is up to you.
[02:50] Come on, eat it.
[02:53] Aunty, you also eat something.
[02:55] Should I make tea for you?
[02:58] Eat it.
[03:06] I think its him.
[03:21] What happened?
[03:28] Did you find her or not?
[03:29] I will tell you, take her inside.
[03:31] Uh
[03:32] Ramsha dear…
[03:33] Come, let me change your clothes, come.
[03:38] I know, where has Aunty gone to…
[04:05] Are you alright?
[04:07] How are you?
[04:09] Did you reach here comfortably?
[04:12] It must have been very difficult for you, you don’t even have a phone.
[04:15] I could have at least sent you the location.
[04:17] No, it’s ok.
[04:24] Greetings!
[04:46] I think that…
[04:48] She must have gone to Anita.
[04:51] Who is Anita?
[04:52] She is Uncle Yousuf’s daughter.
[04:54] Where can we find her?
[04:56] Will have to find out.
[04:57] Then get up.
[04:59] Brother,
[05:00] not like this…
[05:01] It will take time.
[05:02] Will have to find out.
[05:04] What do you mean by it will take time?
[05:07] Brother, everybody keeps secrets from each other after that incident.
[05:10] No one tells about anybody’s address.
[05:18] I also did not go back then.
[05:20] First boarding then hostel.
[05:23] Mother and Father also come here to meet me.
[05:30] Oh…
[05:31] My shift will end at 8 o’clock…
[05:33] So…we will meet here at 10 o’clock and will decide about what to do next.
[05:38] Till then I will settle down Aliya in my hostel…
[05:41] And you find a place here to stay.
[05:43] Ok?
[05:47] Where will he go?
[05:49] There are many hotels in the market here,
he will find a place.
[05:55] Then I will also go along with him.
[05:58] Do you have the marriage certificate?
[06:05] If you don’t have one, how will you stay then,
they ask for it.
[06:12] He has lived in a mosque all his life, he cannot live alone, I will stay with him.
[06:17] There is a mosque also nearby.
[06:30] Anita, in fact, you leave it.
[06:32] We will manage something for ourselves, its ok.
[06:34] We will manage it.
[06:36] Ibrahim, finish the tea so that we can go.
[06:43] Forget it.
[06:44] Leave it, let me think for a few minutes.
[06:47] We will find a solution, ok?
[07:52] Maula daad!
[07:54] Maula daad!
[07:56] There is no water.
[08:07] Come.
[08:07] Come….Come
[08:22] Ok…
[08:23] The lights will remain switched off.
[08:24] Because if it remains switched on,
then anyone can come on.
[08:27] My shift is about to start, I will come back by 6 o’clock…We will decide, what to do after that.
[08:31] This is water, jug and there are biscuits and chips in the cupboard, ok?
[08:36] Ok…
[08:36] I am leaving.
[08:40] Take off the veil.
[08:41] What?
[08:42] Take off the veil.
[08:44] Hmm
[08:50] Aliya Madam…
[08:51] Take off my veil.
[09:02] Aliya Madam!
[09:05] Father, what could I have done and where would I have taken them?
[09:08] I could do only this much in 15 minutes.
[09:11] Her husband is also a loser, total zero.
[09:14] No, no, it’s a weekend and all the girls have gone to their houses. There is no one on my floor as well.
[09:18] I have decided to take an off, two or two and half hours earlier from my shift…
[09:22] Come and get them out of here,
before Aunty wakes up.
[09:25] Yes.
[09:26] Ok, I will get them out, bye!
[09:29] Come.
[09:31] Come on.
[09:35] Where is the plumber coming from, when he has not reached for three days?
[09:39] It’s a limit, there is not a single drop of water.
[09:42] I can’t climb up because of my knees.
[09:44] Wait, wait, see for yourself…
[09:45] Look at the condition yourself.
[09:47] Why are you showing it to me?
[09:50] Maula daad!
[09:52] Hey Maula daad!
[09:53] I have sent him to get something.
[09:55] Your tasks are never ending.
[09:57] You keep sending him here and there all day long.
[10:00] When will he go to call for the electrician or the plumber?
[10:02] He keeps roaming around for you guys.
[10:05] Maula daad: Madam, I couldn’t find it, I visited two or three shops.
[10:07] Its ok, its ok, no problem, I will do it.
[10:11] The condition here is such…
[10:12] That I can’t stay, I’m looking for another place for myself, I will not stay.
[10:16] Go ahead and arrange for another place.
[10:18] You guys show attitude as if you guys are living at your Mother’s place.
[10:21] Yes.
[10:23] Where were you?
[10:24] Aaa…
[10:26] Madam had sent me to get some stuff.
[10:28] Keep doing these things.
[10:30] Sometimes, it’s this Madam, sometimes its Bushra, sometimes its Anita, sometimes its Zubi.
[10:34] Go ahead and keep working for them.
[10:35] Huh
[10:36] Keep roaming around for them.
[10:37] Don’t you have anything else to do?
Is this how you guard?
[10:40] Listen to me very carefully.
[10:43] What I will tell you…
[10:44] You must do that first.
[10:46] Otherwise, I will beat you properly.
[10:49] Go from here.
[10:50] Ok, ok.
[10:53] They have made me go crazy.
[10:55] Oh!
[12:45] Ibrahim!
[12:48] Ibrahim!
[13:34] Aunty!
[13:36] Shall we go inside and talk?
[13:57] What are you doing?
[14:00] Actually
[14:01] I am performing dry ablution;
I couldn’t complete the ablution.
[14:12] Well…
[14:15] Do you know where the prayer mat is kept?
[14:22] Ok, ok.
[14:30] Oh no, no, my Sister, why are you
making me a sinner?
[14:33] Don’t do this.
[14:36] Stop it.
[14:38] a woman’s matter is such.
[14:40] One loses his worth.
[14:42] I apologize on his behalf.
[14:45] Please, forgive him.
[14:48] I have nothing in my heart.
[14:50] I have forgiven him.
[14:53] May God keep you happy.
[14:55] May God keep your daughter happy.
[14:58] The torment we are enduring…May God never put you through such a torment.
[15:03] Aunty…
[15:05] I can’t see Anita around…
[15:08] Where is she these days?
[15:09] Actually…
[15:11] Dear…she is sometimes here,
sometimes somewhere else.
[15:15] Neither she stays in one place nor
does she stick to one job.
[15:19] We are very worried about her.
[15:22] This is the problem Aunty…
[15:25] When a girl loses her mind…
[15:27] She belongs to nowhere then.
[15:30] Neither here nor there.
[15:35] We are also mourning about the same.
[15:38] I can’t understand that what spell has that unfortunate casted?
[15:43] What has he done to her?
[15:45] The girl is not in her senses, she has gone crazy.
[15:47] Neither any shame, nor any dignity.
[15:49] Neither any regard,
[15:51] nor any sense of sin or virtue,
she doesn’t remember anything.
[15:54] Look at my son…
[15:56] Look at him.
[15:57] Is he mad?
[15:58] Has he lost his mind?
[15:59] Why would he divorce a good and decent wife?
[16:02] Tell me.
[16:04] And brother…
[16:06] There is no concept of divorce in our family.
[16:09] We deal with the woman in a strict manner
[16:13] Just once…
[16:14] I left home without permission just once…
[16:17] His Father had tied my legs.
[16:22] Look…
[16:24] You people…
[16:26] If, you can do something… Then
[16:28] help us.
[16:30] Its about our family’s honor.
[16:33] Brother look…
[16:35] It’s a matter of Brother Yaseen’s honor.
[16:39] Despite her shamelessness, my son is ready to keep her, he will forgive her.
[16:45] Look…
[16:47] For his martyrdom’s sake.
[16:49] Save his honor.
[16:55] Mother, leave it.
[16:58] Keep quiet!
[17:02] I will be grateful.
[17:34] What did you get, Mother?
[17:38] After getting yourself humiliated and me insulted….
[17:43] Did you get anything else besides shame and disgrace?
[17:54] I didn’t feel this low and disgraced even then…
[17:58] When he looked into my eye and told me that
[18:00] Aliya is not my wife….
[18:04] Mine?
[18:12] Why didn’t I shoot him?
[18:17] Why didn’t I shoot him?
[18:21] Why didn’t I shoot him?
[18:24] Mother, I am going to shoot myself,
if you utter such a thing again.
[18:30] I am not so low…
[18:34] That she would fall for someone living off my scraps.
[18:39] I have divorced her…Chaudry Shabbir
has divorced her.
[18:48] She was begging and imploring
[18:50] She was even ready to become a housemaid…
[18:53] I will keep her as a housemaid…
[18:59] I will make her feel worthless.
[19:04] Worthless!
[19:59] Oh no man!
[20:04] I told you…
[20:05] Whatever Aunty has to throw away…
[20:08] She takes it out of the fridge and gives it to others.
[20:11] The same happened with Rabia and Arishmal.
[20:14] They kept going to the washroom for two days.
[20:18] I was also wondering that a woman who doesn’t give anything for free…
[20:22] She is distributing beef patties?
[20:25] And that too with a smile.
[20:28] I ate it because of you, buddy.
[20:32] Bushra buddy, come out.
[20:35] I am in a very bad state.
[20:42] Bushra!
[20:49] Bushra!
[20:50] Is it you?
[20:53] Bushra!
[21:46] Hello! This is Anita Yousuf, how can I help you?
[21:49] May I now your name to address you?
[21:52] Would you like to hold please?
[21:56] Can you please tell me where you are right now, try your ATM card again a
[22:00] nd tell me what is written on the screen?
[22:06] Would you like to hold on once again?
[22:13] Greetings!
[22:14] Crimes are happening here.
[22:17] People are being retrieved from the washrooms.
[22:19] And you are having breakfast over there with free loader retired officers.
[22:22] Come quick.
[22:26] They have made me go crazy.
[22:30] My knee ache, God knows…
[22:34] I will deal with you later.
[22:36] You are the culprit.
[22:53] What is wrong with this fan?
[22:56] Once you are done with these tasks…
[22:59] Only then you can get these taps and fans fixed.
[23:01] Sister, I have asked Younus brother…
[23:04] He is delaying it every day.
[23:06] I have tried it myself…
[23:07] I got a serious shock.
[23:09] I will get someone tomorrow…
[23:10] Dear, you will go to the jail tomorrow, dear….
You will see.
[23:13] Sister,
[23:13] I swear upon God, I don’t know, how they have got in.
[23:16] They have dropped from the rooftop?
[23:38] She is a very good mechanic.
[24:16] Maryam!
[24:19] Maryam!
[24:20] Yes.
[24:23] What is it?
[24:24] It’s Madam Bilqees’s call from the hostel.
[24:26] Answer it then.
[24:29] Look, what she has to say.
[24:32] Answer it.
[24:36] Greetings Madam!
[24:38] Do you know Aliya and Ibrahim?
[24:41] Yes, of course.
[24:42] What is your relation with them and who are they?
[24:45] You may say, she is my daughter.
[24:48] Ibrahim is her husband.
[24:52] We have a five-year-old relationship….
[24:54] I am sure that you must not be lying to us.
[24:57] No, no, Madam, why would I lie?
[25:00] Is everything ok?
[25:01] No, nothing is ok.
[25:03] Your daughter has broken my hostel rules.
[25:06] All of you will have to bear the punishment for this.
[25:09] So…
[25:12] What happened?
[25:13] Tell me.
[25:15] They have been caught.
[25:16] Oh…
[25:33] I don’t even pass by this mean man.
[25:36] But I had to fall into his clutches today.
[25:40] Ok listen.
[25:42] Don’t make any more mistakes.
[25:43] Whatever I am telling you…You will say that only.
[25:45] You both have come here in search of work.
[25:47] Someone fed you something on your way and you both got unconscious…
[25:50] He stole everything and left…
[25:52] ID card, money, clothes, everything.
[25:54] Ok?
[25:55] Sir!
[25:57] Sir, there had been an emergency.
[25:59] Sorry, Sir.
[26:01] Sorry, Sir.
[26:05] Seems like, I have lost my job too.
[26:25] What have you decided then?
[26:27] What should be done to them?
[26:29] Expel this girl from the hostel…
[26:31] And file a report against both of them.
[26:35] Hmm.
[26:37] This is justified.
[26:39] If tomorrow she brings someone
else with a veil here…
[26:42] Who will send girls to this hostel then?
[26:45] Uncle, please.
[26:46] I will apologize, will beg…If you want, I will even rub my nose in front of everyone.
[26:51] But please…Don’t do this.
[26:54] No.
[26:55] Rules are rules.
[26:57] Ok.
[26:58] I am ok….If you want to expel me, go ahead.
[27:01] But please, spare them, it’s not their fault.
[27:04] People trust us and send their girls to this hostel…
[27:08] And because of people like you…
[27:10] We should ruin our reputation?
[27:12] Uncle, do you know, I am about to lose my job even.
[27:15] When Aunty called, I left the customer on hold there…
[27:19] And the company has taken a serious
notice against this.
[27:23] They should have taken the notice.
[27:25] Uncle, please…
[27:27] Aunty…
[27:28] I have been living here for the past five years, please.
[27:35] You guys sit outside.
[27:37] Let me do something.
[27:42] Maula daad!
[27:44] No one should go out of the gate.
[27:56] Madam, you were not fair.
[27:59] If, I lose my job then you will be responsible for that.
[28:06] What do you say then?
[28:09] Give it a thought.
[28:12] That girl is skilled in all kinds of tasks.
[28:14] Electrician,
[28:15] plumbing, woodwork, cooking, cleaning, moping…Everything.
[28:21] And that boy must also be skilled to some extent.
[28:24] If nothing, then he can be a guard.
[28:28] Farooq!
[28:29] If, a single electrical or plumbering task has to be done…
[28:34] One has to beg the mechanics.
[28:37] One has to plead them.
[28:39] Even to tighten a single screw…None of them charge less than 500.
[28:43] And the sweeper, if I instruct him a little, he starts giving looks.
[28:47] And that maid…She shows attitude over everything.
[28:51] And that Watchman…You know about him.
[28:55] I will get the work of five to six people done by this husband and wife.
[28:58] You will see.
[29:03] Neither do they have an address,
[29:05] nor any identity, no guarantees.
[29:07] Yousuf Maseeh is there for the address and identities.
[29:10] As far as the guarantee is concerned…
[29:12] It’s his daughter.
[29:13] It’s a five-year-old relationship.
[29:16] One gets to know someone in such a long time.
[29:20] Hmm?
[29:24] Okay
[29:38] Listen!
[29:44] Aliya Madam!
[29:46] I have an idea.
[29:50] If …
[29:51] If the police come now…
[29:54] Tell the police that you don’t know me…
[29:57] And you have no relation with me.
[29:59] And this way,
[30:00] they will talk to me about everything that concerns you, you will be safe.
[30:04] I will deal with it.
[30:06] Hmm?
[31:01] I, Anita Yousuf, daughter of Yousuf Maseeh…
[31:04] Solemnly, declare that Mohammad Ibrahim, son of Mohammad Ilyas…
[31:09] And Aliya Yaseen, daughter of Miyan Mohammad Yaseen, are husband and wife.
[31:15] And I guarantee that in Madam Bilqees hostel for women…
[31:20] They will display good behavior and exemplary conduct.
[31:24] Furthermore, I take full responsibility for any damage, theft, fraud, or deceit during their stay…
[31:33] And will compensate for any losses incurred in this regard.
[31:39] Otherwise, legal action of any kind may be taken against me.
[31:44] Signature, Anita Yousuf, daughter of Yousuf Maseeh.
[32:09] I already drank some.
[32:22] Blow it.
[33:03] I have given your guarantee as well.
[33:04] And….Don’t leave this gate next time.
[33:08] Ibrahim will do the outside work.
[33:10] May God keep you happy Madam.
[33:16] Buddy, when I saw at night, no I got scared.
[33:20] Why did you get scared?
[33:21] I did not know.
[33:23] Quiet!
[33:25] Are all the girls present?
[33:27] Yes Ma’am!
[33:29] I can’t see Aiman and Fauzia.
[33:31] They refused and have gone out.
[33:34] Hmm.
[33:36] Two days back, whatever happened in this hostel…
[33:40] You guys must have told that to each other adding more spice to it.
[33:45] Yes Sir.
[33:46] Stop all this.
[33:48] What is this nonsense?
[33:49] Give it to me.
[33:51] Their social media never ends.
[33:54] Whatever Anita did…
[33:57] If, anyone of you wants to do that then go ahead and fulfill your desire.
[34:03] But what a heavy price Anita had to pay, listen to that…
[34:08] This ….
[34:09] apology letter…
[34:12] 10,000 rupees fine…
[34:15] Which Anita has gone to submit.
[34:18] Apart from this…
[34:20] For one month…
[34:22] They both ….
[34:23] will work for free in this hostel.
[34:27] Cleaning and mopping,
[34:29] kitchen,
[34:30] laundry
[34:31] and groceries.
[34:33] Apart from this…
[34:35] Whatever this office
[34:36] orders them…
[34:39] They will have to fulfill it.
[34:42] This was the first incident of this hostel…
[34:45] That’s why they were dealt leniently.
[34:47] Cleaning and mopping apart…
[34:50] I will make you guys clean the floor with your nose.
[34:53] Do you guys get it?
[34:55] Yes Sir.
[34:55] You may go.
[34:56] Ok Sir.
[35:04] I think, you guys must also have understood it.
[35:10] Go now…
[35:12] and get started.
[35:18] Come on, Good! Good!
[35:20] The customer is on hold for fifteen hours.
[35:23] I tried to convince a lot saying,
[35:25] please, hang up…
[35:27] He says, no…
[35:28] He will hang up only when the person who asked him to hold, will say it.
[35:32] Sorry Sir, there was a very big emergency.
[35:36] I hope the patient will survive.
[35:38] Yes, Sir, I hope.
[35:41] Uh…
[35:42] Should I consider myself unemployed?
[35:49] You will not be dealt leniently next time.
[35:51] Thank you, Sir.
[35:52] Sorry Sir, it will not happen again.
[35:54] Thank you!
[36:20] I pray to God…
[36:25] That there is good news.
[36:27] Good news will not come from my side Cleric Sir, it will come from your side.
[36:33] There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.
[36:42] My patience is running out, Cleric Sir.
[36:46] Before, I hire a hitman to finish him off
[36:54] Give it another try.
[36:59] Mr. Chaudry…
[37:01] Tell me honestly…
[37:03] What can I do?
[37:05] You…
[37:09] can file a theft report against him.
[37:20] Honorable, Mr. SHO…
[37:22] Murshidabad police station, district Rangpura.
[37:25] It is requested that I have been serving as the leader of the Shaam Nagar mosque for a long time…
[37:30] For the upkeep, cleanliness, and five times call to prayer…
[37:34] A person, Mohammad Ibrahim, son of Mohammad Ilyas, is assigned.
[37:39] For all the mosque’s expenses, a donation box has been placed.
[37:44] Is it ok?
[37:46] It is ok.
[37:48] From which approximately, 25 to 30 thousand, is recovered monthly.
[37:53] The entire charity amount along with Mohammad Ibrahim, have been missing for the last five days.
[37:58] Therefore, I request that you immediately arrest the above mentioned accused and recover the amount.
[38:06] Mosque leader, Rangpura.
[38:08] Cleric, Ghulam Rasool.
[38:10] Sign it, Cleric Sir.
[38:42] Bilqees Aunty!
[38:44] Bilqees Aunty!
[38:48] Bilqees Aunty!
[38:51] Bilqees Aunty, Anita!
[38:53] Bilqees Aunty!
[38:54] What happened?
[38:56] What happened? Why are you crying?
[38:58] Why are you crying so bitterly?
[39:00] Tell me why are you crying? Why are you getting distressed?
[39:02] Aunty, Ibrahim has left.
