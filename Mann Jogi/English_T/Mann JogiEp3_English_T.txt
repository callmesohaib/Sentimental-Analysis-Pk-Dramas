[01:26] Mother, what is wrong with you?
[01:28] I said it out of anger.
[01:29] Does someone give a divorce out of love too?
[01:32] Ok, I will give charity Mother, what is wrong with you?
[01:34] There is no room for adjustments in Islamic laws.
[01:44] My apologies.
[01:58] Have some water.
[02:15] What…
[02:17] what were you doing?
[02:23] What should I have been doing then?
[02:27] I am not even worthy to be cursed…
[02:36] Don’t …don’t be stubborn, have some water.
[02:44] Aliya Madam, don’t worry.
[02:46] The man is responsible in such matters.
[02:48] I will give the answer, I will take care of it, you…
[02:51] No one will question you.
[02:56] As if woman is some vessel.
[03:01] One dirties it and hands it over to the other person.
[03:05] The other person cleans it and returns it to the first.
[03:15] I will not go back, Ibrahim.
[03:22] Better to die at the hands of an honorable
person than to live with a shameless person.
[03:30] My blood is forgiven for you; I will write it down.
[03:32] No, I can’t do this.
[03:34] Aliya Madam, I can’t do this, I …
[03:36] What can you do then?
[03:39] What can you do?
[03:42] You are scared of humans, you are scared of God.
[03:47] If you did not have the courage to refuse
then you should have runaway.
[03:50] You couldn’t do that either.
[03:52] You stayed here to be taken care by Shabbir.
[03:56] If you would have had runaway, I would
not have had to face this night.
[03:58] I had packed my bags but the cleric stood before me.
[04:01] I tried to runaway but…
[04:03] He could not runaway, he would
have been answerable, he…
[04:05] Ok then fulfill the responsibility that
the cleric has imposed on you.
[04:09] Why are you sitting here and crying for your parents?
[04:15] Ibrahim!
[04:17] Ibrahim!
[04:21] The time for morning prayers is close.
[04:23] Shabbir is waiting for his belonging, get up.
[04:31] Get up.
[04:39] Let me run away, Ibrahim.
[04:46] You can do this much at least, in God’s name.
[04:52] Hey, hey, hey,
[04:53] Aunty!
[04:54] What are you doing?
[04:54] Its Usman inside.
[04:57] Then where did…she go?
[04:59] She?
[05:00] Who she?
[05:02] Our Aliya, who else?
[05:04] Aliya?
[05:05] Where did she come from?
[05:07] Oh! Since she has got married to Chaudry Shabbir…
[05:11] She has forgotten about us, poor folks.
[05:14] Aunty!
[05:15] Who told you about Aliya?
[05:17] I have seen her myself coming towards your house.
[05:20] There was a man also with her.
[05:23] Aunty!
[05:23] You have searched the whole house, have you?
[05:25] Hmm.
[05:25] Only the rooftop is left.
[05:26] Go and check the rooftop too, go.
[05:28] Where did she go then?
[05:30] Have some water.
[05:37] Then…
[05:37] Who was she then?
[05:40] She…
[05:41] Oh yes, I remember, the polio team came over.
[05:43] To give drops to the children.
[05:45] OK.
[05:46] I became happy thinking that I will get to meet Aliya…
[05:49] And I will tell her husband…
[05:51] To get my son a job.
[05:53] I have heard that he has a lot
of influence in the offices.
[05:55] I had brought this chit…
[05:58] And a little money too…
[05:59] For the sweet.
[06:00] I thought that he will give it to the officers…
[06:02] And my son will get a job.
[06:04] You do one thing…
[06:06] Let me talk to her on the mobile phone.
[06:09] I don’t have balance in my mobile.
[06:15] Ok…
[06:16] fine, then give it to her.
[06:18] And give her my message too.
[06:21] OK.
[06:26] Scorpion
[06:32] Tsh!
[06:37] Tsh! Tsh! Tsh!
[06:42] Aaaa!
[06:59] Aliya Madam!
[07:14] Where is your stole?
[07:16] Anyways…
[07:17] Whatever is happening…
[07:20] You must have forgotten about the stole.
[07:29] Sister in law was asking me
about where my stole was?
[07:33] Brother, Shabbir did not let it be on my head.
[07:38] His anger left me unveiled.
[07:43] I kept thinking that he must have
done that out of anger.
[07:46] But he did not decide about the
Halala marriage out of anger.
[07:50] He must have imagined but he
still took the same decision.
[07:55] He was not saving me, Brother.
[07:58] He was saving his honor and his politics.
[08:02] One commits a sin…
[08:03] And someone else bears the atonement,
this is not fair, Brother.
[08:08] And…
[08:09] To go through an act, which makes you feel sick.
[08:13] He did not have to go through it, I had to go through it.
[08:18] That’s why he is a nobody to me.
[08:21] He is dead with all his ego.
[08:42] What did you decide then?
[08:52] I won’t be able to do it.
[08:55] What can’t you do?
[09:00] I can’t go to another man…
[09:04] You will not go just like that.
[09:06] You will get married properly.
[09:12] You weren’t that old when you became a widow…
[09:15] Why didn’t you get married then?
[09:18] Death snatched my husband from me.
[09:21] Life is snatching it away from you,
you can take him back.
[09:28] Shabbir has no objection that
I will go to another man…
[09:31] Again, the same thing.
[09:33] He will be your husband and no stranger.
[09:38] And Shabbir too, will go through this pain.
[09:42] It’s like death for a husband to
send his wife to another man.
[09:47] You guys will have to go through it.
[09:50] Now that you have made a mistake then…
[09:52] It wasn’t my mistake.
[09:54] Ok, it wasn’t your mistake?
[09:56] Did she tie your hands and feet and took you along?
[09:58] And the videos you got made and
hand them over to everyone.
[10:02] My son got embarrassed before the whole party.
[10:05] He is still ready to own you.
[10:07] He is holding your hand after walking over embers.
[10:09] But you are so thankless.
[10:11] What should we do, should we send
you to your Brother’s house?
[10:14] Tell me.
[10:15] Your Brother will kill himself.
[10:17] He went through such a hard time while
saving his Sister in law’s house.
[10:26] Look…
[10:28] You will go to some other man too anyways.
[10:31] Tell me.
[10:35] After leaving from here….
[10:37] You will knock at someone else’s door too
[10:43] There is no space for you in your Brother’s house.
[11:00] Should I hand her over to anyone random man?
[11:05] What will you do then?
[11:06] Will you take her marriage proposal yourself?
[11:09] Even an animal licks and cleans its plate…
[11:13] What does this mean?
[11:15] Can a person eat food in it?
[11:17] Anyways…
[11:19] it is not so…..We will have to look
for a relative or an outsider.
[11:24] Anyways…
[11:26] Don’t you worry.
[11:27] We will find a way out.
[11:32] Let me offer prayers.
[11:34] Ok?
[11:57] If someone asks about Shabbir,
tell them that he is not home.
[12:03] Greetings!
[12:06] Greetings!
[12:08] Greetings!
[12:09] Actually
[12:11] The mosque’s electricity is gone.
[12:13] Its time for call to prayer.
[12:16] Call some electrician.
[12:19] Jawaid has gone to Lahore and…
[12:22] The Cleric doesn’t allow Altaf.
[12:25] He says
[12:26] that he is a Non-Muslim.
[12:29] Shabbir is sleeping, he is not well.
[12:32] You guys do something on your own.
[12:34] Sister!
[12:38] If sister helps us…
[12:41] She is skilled in electrical work.
[12:42] It will make the job easier, I will give a call to prayer.
[12:45] It will not take long, just for a short time, if she…
[12:47] Helps us, it will be good.
[12:50] Can’t you understand once?
[12:53] I said, do something on your own.
[12:56] My apologies…I…
[12:58] I will look after it, don’t be angry.
[13:03] My apologies.
[13:04] I shall leave.
[13:43] Shabbir!
[13:45] Shabbir!
[13:48] I have found the guy.
[13:54] Ibrahim.
[14:29] Ibrahim!
[14:30] Read it loudly.
[14:38] Finish your school.
[14:41] I have to talk to you.
[14:42] OK.
[14:45] Hey!
[14:46] Finish the lesson, I had told you and you too.
[14:48] I will be back in an hour and will listen to it.
[14:49] Ok, good boys?
[14:51] Let’s go.
[15:43] Ibrahim, buddy!
[15:48] I have made a huge mistake.
[15:53] I need your help.
[15:58] God will do best.
[16:02] You just order me.
[16:05] It’s not an order, buddy…
[16:08] It’s a request.
[16:11] I am at your service brother, tell me.
[16:21] Buddy…
[16:26] I have…
[16:31] Given a divorce to Aliya.
[16:40] There is no power or strength except with Allah.
[16:43] What do I do now?
[16:48] Brother…
[16:49] The cleric can guide you better but what
I have heard from him is that…
[16:53] In such a situation, you should choose
to separate yourself with courtesy.
[16:57] If you have given any gifts or if you owe
her any rights, fulfill those please.
[17:02] Yes, yes, yes.
[17:05] Don’t teach me the Islamic rules.
[17:07] Sure, my apologies.
[17:10] I know, I am aware of it.
[17:13] If she marries someone else and gets a
divorce from him, she can remarry me.
[17:17] Yes, yes, exactly.
[17:18] Isn’t it?
[17:18] Is it so?
[17:19] Yes.
[17:20] So then…
[17:22] This has to be done.
[17:27] This has to be done, Ibrahim.
[17:34] You…
[17:37] Get married to Aliya.
[17:46] Did he agree?
[17:50] You may say…
[17:52] That he has almost agreed.
[18:12] No, no, Aunty, not Ibrahim.
[18:16] Why?
[18:17] Why not Ibrahim?
[18:20] If not Ibrahim, then…
[18:22] have you found someone else?
[18:27] Someone else?
[18:30] I mean,
[18:32] some old acquaintance, someone
from the neighborhood…
[18:35] Someone from school or college,
who might have been after you.
[18:41] Beautiful girls do have lovers.
[18:44] Aunty!
[18:55] Look, why can’t you understand?
[18:57] Shabbir loves you a lot.
[19:01] He doesn’t want to send you to some loser.
[19:06] Ok…if, not Ibrahim…
[19:09] Then suggest someone of your choice.
[19:21] He is like a Brother to me.
[19:25] Before marriage, Shabbir was also…
[19:28] like a brother to you, what kind of a logic is this?
[19:30] He is a very pious boy…Aunty.
[19:35] So?
[19:36] Do you want to marry a thief, a rogue
[19:39] or a troublemaker?
[20:09] I am sorry, Mr. Chaudry.
[20:15] What you are talking about….
[20:18] is a very big sin.
[20:22] I can’t go ahead with this marriage.
[20:25] I respect her a lot…
[20:27] This is why I am asking you Ibrahim.
[20:33] This is why, I am asking you that she will restart her life with the same respect and honor, where it broke off from.
[20:42] Otherwise, she…
[20:43] will become homeless and destitute.
[20:46] If you will not agree…
[20:47] then what will I do?
[20:49] I will hold her hand and left her to her Brother’s house….Whatever will happen to her life after that…
[20:54] Who will be responsible for that?
[20:56] Who will it be, it will be you, who else?
[20:59] Sir, me…?
[21:02] My Mother has brought you up like his own child.
[21:05] Yes…yes.
[21:06] I have treated you like a younger Brother.
[21:09] Yes, definitely.
[21:11] If you will not stand by me in this
hard time, then who else will?
[21:15] Mr. Chaudry, the thing is that…
[21:16] My honor…
[21:19] My dignity, my privacy, everything…
[21:21] Everything, is in your hands now.
[21:25] Look…
[21:27] I have hardened my heart, haven’t I?
[21:31] I have hardened my heart, haven’t I?
[21:32] Yes.
[21:34] Aliya will also do so.
[21:37] Its just
[21:38] You also harden your heart.
[21:41] Whatever you will say…
[21:43] I will follow that all my life.
[21:46] I will not forget about your favor, all my life.
[21:52] Mr. Chaudry, I am…
[21:54] not a big religious scholar.
[21:57] What you are saying…
[21:59] is a sin Mr. Chaudry…it’s a sin.
[22:10] I have told you…
[22:14] Don’t teach me the Islamic laws.
[22:35] Take your belongings and…
[22:37] And get out of this house.
[22:38] Right now.
[22:40] And ask your Brother to find a new man for you.
[22:44] Our relationship is over.
[22:47] After the divorce….
[22:49] You have got only these two dresses
[22:51] Come on, get out.
[23:38] Pack my bags too.
[23:47] You…
[23:50] There will be no space for me
in the mosque after this.
[23:55] You are not at fault in this.
[24:01] I was the one, who brought you on my shoulders.
[24:08] A mosque is God’s house.
[24:14] Why are you leaving then?
[24:23] After this insult…
[24:27] It is not justified for me, to stay here.
[24:30] You couldn’t bear it during your youth…
[24:33] How will I be able to tolerate all this in this old age?
[24:39] Chaudry Shabbir…
[24:41] Will account for every single morsel.
[24:44] The politics here has made him generous.
[24:47] When that will not exist…
[24:50] Then why would he allow me to stay here?
[25:15] Can’t I stay like Noora in this house?
[25:21] You get remarried.
[25:26] I am already facing taunts for my infertility.
[25:31] You can’t spend a day with another man and…
[25:34] You are tying me with another woman,
for the rest of my life.
[25:38] It’s difficult for a woman…
[25:42] Very difficult, in fact, it is impossible.
[25:48] She can hand herself over to one man only.
[25:51] Aliya, a woman can not at all look at another man.
[26:01] To get you again…
[26:05] Only I know the suffering, I will endure
[26:13] Ibrahim…
[26:17] is a very clean and tidy man…
[26:19] If he would not have been there…then I myself,
would have had separated from you.
[26:23] I would never have had let you
pass through this stinky path.
[26:31] I had a word with Ibrahim….
He respects you a lot and…
[26:37] To make you restart an honorable life…He..
[29:51] I will never be able to meet them.
[29:59] Everything has been destroyed.
[30:11] My life has been ruined.
[30:14] It is not so dear.
[30:15] It is so.
[30:20] It is exactly like that.
[30:25] Either you are lying to me now or you
have been lying to me all your life.
[30:36] Greetings!
[30:38] Greetings!
[30:59] Mother, it is not needed.
[31:00] It’s ok.
[31:02] There is a need.
[31:17] Here you go.
[31:20] Take a shower and wear it.
[31:28] Take a good shower and…
[31:30] wear it.
[31:43] This is for you.
[31:45] Thank you
[32:26] When Shabbir had died for you…
[32:30] Why were you sitting in that house then?
[32:35] Were you waiting for this day?
[32:41] I was waiting for my death, Sister-in-law.
[33:08] What do you think, Mr. Chaudry?
[33:14] If she is dead… then
[33:17] where is the dead body?
[33:22] A suicide attempt has been made…
[33:27] Because
[33:30] I have seen both of them alive.
[34:02] Cleric Sir!
[34:06] I hope you are not hiding anything.
[34:09] How can I become a reason for your
disgrace and dishonor, Mr. Chaudry?
[34:15] And neither can Ibrahim dare to do this.
[34:19] What is happening then, Sir?
[34:23] Where should I look for them? Where should I search for them? Whom should I hold accountable?
[34:27] Whom should I confront?
[34:31] If you don’t mind…
[34:33] May I say something, Mr. Chaudry?
[34:38] There is only one door…
[34:42] Which has the answer to it.
[34:50] Repentance.
[34:54] There is just one door…
[34:58] Where we can find an answer to it.
[35:04] In this act…
[35:07] There has been a violation of divine commands.
[35:12] Please, appeal to Him…
[35:15] To show mercy and resolve this problem.
[35:19] Ease these difficulties.
[35:26] And the one that is hidden and concealed ….
[35:29] reveal and unhide it…
[35:32] Cleric Sir, nothing like that is going to happen.
[35:34] Because I will not stay idle.
[35:42] You…
[35:45] You will come with me to his house.
[35:48] House?
[35:51] His entire village was a heap of debris.
[35:56] Only one child was left there…..
[36:01] Whom I
[36:03] brought here in my lap.
[36:17] What have you done?
[36:19] Story is not…
[36:21] What she is narrating.
[36:23] The matter is different.
[36:25] She has not been divorced.
[36:28] She has fled in the name of love.
[36:30] What rubbish are you talking about?
[36:32] I am not talking rubbish.
[36:33] I am right…..You will see, it will
turn out to be like this later.
[36:57] May I leave?
[37:04] Yes.
[37:05] What will you tell them?
[37:07] What had been decided…
[37:11] That you ran away and I was looking for you.
[37:14] You can’t say this anymore.
[37:17] The cleric saw us leaving together, didn’t he?
[37:24] Now you will say that you were coming to drop me back home and I ran away on the way.
[37:29] Then you returned after looking for me.
[37:31] Do you get it?
[37:38] OK.
[37:39] You don’t seem like you have understood.
[37:43] No…
[37:46] there is
[37:47] there is a problem.
[37:49] What problem?
[37:50] Divorce…
[37:56] How…?
[38:00] Here…?
[38:04] Right now?
