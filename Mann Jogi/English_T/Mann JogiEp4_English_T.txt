[01:20] No, no, Aunty, not Ibrahim.
[01:25] Why?
[01:26] Why not Ibrahim?
[01:29] If, not Ibrahim then…
[01:31] Have you found someone else?
[01:33] A suicide attempt has been made…
[01:35] Because…
[01:37] I have seen them both alive.
[01:40] Divorce…
[01:45] How…?
[01:49] Here…?
[01:53] Right now?
[01:57] Divorce…
[02:00] No, no divorce.
[02:02] This is what was decided between us
that before morning prayers, I will…
[02:06] I said, no divorce.
[02:10] You are not understanding the point, we…
[02:13] We will never meet again.
[02:15] Its ok.
[02:23] You ….
[02:24] will be bound.
[02:29] This restriction is my freedom.
[02:31] You may go Ibrahim, thank you very much.
[02:49] May I….
[02:51] May I tell you something?
[02:57] I was not going to the mosque.
[03:02] And
[03:03] I can’t lie…standing there.
[03:08] Where are you going then, Ibrahim?
[03:18] I don’t know.
[03:34] She has been found.
[03:41] She is sitting at her Brother’s house…
[03:45] With Ibrahim.
[04:26] Let’s go.
[04:29] Let’s go.
[04:37] Why are you doing all this?
[04:40] Where would you go?
[04:42] It’s my problem…
[04:45] No matter where I go….I….
[04:49] I am not your responsibility.
[04:53] And why do you want to suffer with me?
[04:56] I have to anyways.
[04:58] These people can’t bear my burden.
[05:01] In front of Shabbir, Brother breathes
after taking permission from him
[05:12] You…you do one thing…you take care of your situation.
[05:15] I will take care of my situation.
[05:18] What will you do or what can you do,
don’t I know that?
[05:21] Let’s go now.
[05:26] Ibrahim, let’s go.
[05:34] They are running away.
[05:59] It’s with me.
[06:13] And it will stay with me from now on.
[06:23] You said that he came to drop you.
[06:25] So, he is not going to the mosque.
[06:26] What have you got to do with it?
[06:28] I also need a shelter to stay.
[06:30] This is your house; don’t you have a share in it?
[06:32] You can’t fight with Shabbir.
[06:33] There is nothing to fight about,
if he has divorced you then it’s over.
[06:36] Things will not get over so simply
Brother, you also know this.
[06:40] Things will not get over even like this, Aliya.
[06:42] Ok then both of you get out of this,
it’s between me and him.
[06:45] You tell us,
[06:45] what is the truth, we will step aside.
[06:47] Sister in law!
[06:48] He is saying that the divorce never happened.
[06:50] The matter is something else.
[06:51] Have you told Shabbir that I am here?
[06:53] Yes.
[06:54] We will have to talk to him after all.
[06:56] Then you go ahead and talk to him.
[06:58] We will talk in front of you.
[06:59] No, I have ended the matter.
[07:01] We are not the neighbors, who
will sit and listen to stories.
[07:03] We also have to answer the people.
[07:05] And Brother I only know what answer
I have to give to my God.
[07:08] Shut the door.
[07:08] Sister in law!
[07:09] Let me see how she leaves.
[07:09] Brother!
[07:10] Shut the door.
[07:11] Don’t make a sound.
[07:11] Don’t you have manners?
[07:13] You are misbehaving with your elder brother.
[07:13] Come on Brother, you also leave.
[07:16] Come on.
[07:18] Brother!
[07:21] Sister in law….leave the door…
[07:32] Listen to me.
[07:33] We have to resolve the matter very wisely.
[07:36] Don’t lose your temper at all.
[07:37] Hmm?
[07:39] What are you doing?
[07:41] Because of this nature of yours,
we have reached this situation
[07:45] Mother don’t lecture me at this time.
[07:48] I am extremely annoyed
[07:50] Listen to me…
[07:51] Wisdom lies in, quietly and
calmly discussing things…
[07:56] Otherwise, the mustache that
keep on twirling, will be gone too.
[08:01] That’s it.
[08:02] I will speak and you will stay silent, that’s it.
[08:04] You will not speak at all.
[08:05] Come on, get off.
[08:16] Where is she?
[08:21] Where is she?
[08:26] Speak up…where is she?
[08:29] Brother…
[08:31] She has left.
[08:34] She has left?
[08:37] Where did she go?
[08:40] How did she go?
[08:43] Didn’t you stop her?
[08:44] Were your hands broken?
[08:46] Brother!
[08:47] A man was along with her too.
[08:48] She was not alone.
[08:56] Come on Brother, you also leave.
[08:59] Come on, man.
[09:02] Come on.
[09:06] Save your life, Brother.
[09:08] He is coming.
[09:09] Don’t you know about Shabbir?
[09:12] Come on…
[09:12] Come on…
[09:13] Come on…
[09:15] Come on…
[09:29] Sister in law, where would he live,
he is not allowed in the mosque?
[09:31] You stand quietly, he may go wherever he
wants to, you relax and stand here.
[09:34] Sister in law, he cannot stay there.
[09:36] He may stay wherever but you will stay here, that’s it.
[09:38] Shabbir Brother…
[09:38] Listen to your Brother, Shabbir may
leave, you will stay here.
[09:41] I have a man with me.
[09:41] No way.
[09:58] Aliya, Aliya, Aliya, Aliya, stop, stop.
[10:01] We will be badly disgraced, badly defamed.
[10:03] If, not yours then at least consider our honor.
[10:05] Kill me then.
[10:06] Kill me, poison me.
[10:09] That house is more suffocating for me than a grave.
[10:26] Neither you are from the neighborhood
nor from a nearby area.
[10:31] This is why I came to you.
[10:35] To tell you the truth.
[10:40] May the whole world curse me…
[10:44] But you should know about what
happened with your sister.
[10:50] But I know that you can’t bear the burden…
[10:55] This is why I am removing you from the situation.
[11:05] Give love to Ramsha, Sister in law.
[11:09] Let’s go Ibrahim.
[11:28] You should get your hands and feet broken
and start begging on the road.
[11:33] God knows, what kind of a shameless Brother are you?
[11:37] Brother!
[11:38] Shut up!
[11:38] Oho!
[11:40] What’s the point in sitting home and fighting?
[11:43] Go out and look for her.
[11:44] She must not have gone far, she must be nearby.
[11:53] What are you doing?
[11:55] Mother!
[11:57] Listen to me.
[12:00] Mother!
[12:18] Now…
[12:20] Where will go?
[12:24] You may go.
[12:28] Where?
[12:31] I don’t know where….
[12:35] This is such a big world, there is a huge
crowd of people, go somewhere, hide.
[12:45] I don’t know any place apart from the mosque
[12:49] and the chamber.
[12:52] There must be someone.
[12:54] Some relative, some friend,
[12:56] some old companion or mate.
[12:59] How is it possible that one doesn’t have anyone?
[13:01] It’s only the cleric.
[13:05] God knows, what situation he must be in?
[13:10] Mr. Chaudry will take out all his anger on him only.
[13:15] You…
[13:16] you tell me about yourself, you…
[13:19] Must have thought something about yourself.
[13:22] Where will you go?
[13:25] There is another grave of my
Father in this city, I will go there.
[13:28] Ok…
[13:29] fine, then let’s go.
[13:32] You will stay safe, if you will stay without me.
[13:34] Please, go.
[13:35] I can’t leave you alone, under the open sky.
[13:40] Let me drop you to some doorstep or some shelter then I will go from there.
[13:48] Come, please.
[14:38] Yousuf!
[14:39] Hmm.
[14:40] Hey Yousuf!
[14:42] Hmm.
[14:43] Look over there.
[14:56] Aliya?
[14:58] Yes.
[15:07] Aliya!
[15:10] Aliya!
[15:31] Father!
[15:32] Father!
[15:33] Yousuf Uncle, leave me.
[15:35] Father!
[15:37] Father!
[15:38] Yousuf Uncle, I want to go with Father.
[15:41] Father!
[15:47] Yousuf Uncle!
[16:05] Listen to me Maryam.
[16:07] This time…
[16:09] Its our turn, to burn in the fire.
[16:13] Have to pay Yaseen’s debt.
[16:44] Tea.
[16:45] Oh, there was no need for this.
[16:48] Its ok, have tea.
[16:52] I still can’t believe it
[16:55] How can she do this, Aunty?
[16:59] I, myself can’t believe that boy.
[17:02] He never dared to look at anyone.
[17:04] He was a boy, raised in our house.
[17:07] He would turn out to be so disloyal,
I could have never imagined
[17:12] She never paid head to even the best of them.
[17:15] I don’t know…
[17:17] What did she see in this foolish man…?
[17:19] And that too in the presence of a
handsome man like Shabbir.
[17:22] Yes, I also kept thinking…
[17:25] That he is an orphan, she must be
feeling pity and sorry for him.
[17:30] Give her a divorce and set her free.
[17:33] What’s the point of keeping such a woman?
[17:35] Our honor is intact…
[17:37] Yours….mine, everybody’s honor.
[17:39] From Yaseen Brother, to your daughter.
[17:43] The stain of divorce…
[17:45] will mark everyone.
[17:48] She will still not refrain.
[17:51] The condition, I saw her in…
[17:54] Oh God!
[17:55] May God forgive me.
[17:57] If it would have been some other woman…
[17:59] She would have been shivering with fear.
[18:02] She was standing so close to him in the store as well.
[18:07] Anyways…
[18:09] Let me ……
[18:10] visit the neighbors.
[18:12] I might get a clue of her.
[18:15] I will be back in a short while.
[18:24] Ok.
[18:25] Now tell me, what is this white wire for?
[18:27] It’s a cold wire.
[18:28] And what about this red one?
[18:30] Hot wire.
[18:31] When we make a connection, which wire do we…?
[18:33] Hot…
[18:34] Yaseen Brother, Yaseen Brother, Yaseen Brother.
[18:36] Yaseen Brother.
[18:37] There has been a big trouble.
[18:39] There is fire everywhere.
[18:41] Do one thing, take the girl and leave quickly.
[18:44] Dear, come here.
[18:46] Yousuf, you listen to me.
[18:49] Take Aliya along and go.
[18:50] I will deal with them, don’t worry.
[18:52] Are you in your senses Yaseen Brother?
[18:53] Buddy, do as I ask you to do.
[18:55] Dear, go with Uncle.
[18:56] No,
[18:57] No…No
[18:58] No.
[18:59] No, no.
[19:01] Father!
[19:02] Father!
[19:03] Aliya dear!
[19:04] Yousuf Uncle, leave me.
[19:05] Aliya dear, come.
[19:06] Father!
[19:07] Father!
[19:08] Yousuf Uncle, I have to go with Father.
[19:11] Aliya dear, hurry up.
[19:12] Father!
[19:53] Yousuf Uncle, no…no.
[19:55] I want to go to Father.
[19:57] I want to go to Father.
[19:59] Leave me, please.
[20:01] I want to go to Father.
[20:03] I want to go to Father.
[20:21] Father pleaded a lot with them.
[20:27] He begged them a lot.
[20:33] But their anger did not allow
them to listen to anything.
[20:41] The fire spread in midst of this turmoil…
[20:47] And I saw my Father one last time in that very fire.
[20:54] Burning and trembling.
[21:03] It is called martyrdom.
[21:15] Usman came over…
[21:17] With an excuse of checking the meter.
[21:21] But there is one thing…
[21:23] He must be sure that you can go anywhere
[21:26] but you will not come here.
[21:29] Why did you guys stand up?
[21:30] Sit down, my lovely daughter….
[21:31] Sit down and have water at least.
[21:34] I have sent Maryam.
[21:37] I have asked her to find out and inquire about them.
[21:43] Why are you getting worried?
[21:44] Sit down, my lovely daughter
[21:45] Don’t worry.
[21:47] Sit down.
[21:48] Have water.
[22:17] Hey
[22:18] Maryam Aunty, it’s you?
[22:21] How come you are here after such a long time?
[22:30] Both families had very good terms.
[22:34] You may say that they were one family.
[22:36] All the joys and sorrows were mutual.
[22:40] Sweets on festivals…
[22:45] Cake on the big day.
[22:47] Crackers on Easter and holy festivals.
[22:51] Everything was mutual.
[22:57] She was very little.
[23:00] She would come every second or third
day on the cycle with her Father.
[23:03] At the back…
[23:05] The toolbox was kept
[23:06] and she would sit in the front.
[23:11] Her Father used to call her junior mechanic.
[23:16] Wherever Yaseen would work in the neighborhood…
[23:19] The Father and daughter would come and have tea and biscuits at my place on their way back.
[23:24] He used to do the church work…for free.
[23:28] If anything was required,
[23:29] he would bring it from his own pocket.
[23:38] May be this is why God…
[23:41] Gave him the status of a martyr.
[23:49] When the bill is paid,
[23:50] there’s no money left for food.
[23:52] It seems like the neighbor’s units
are also being added into ours.
[23:57] I came to show it to Usman.
[23:59] One
[24:00] fan…and two bulbs…
[24:03] they have given us such a huge bill.
[24:05] Huh?
[24:07] Usman came in the neighborhood…
[24:09] to check the meters.
[24:11] He doesn’t visit us.
[24:13] Yousuf stopped me a lot…
[24:16] But I said…
[24:17] They will not shut the door on me.
[24:20] Isn’t it?
[24:21] We have only stopped visiting but there is no conflict…
[24:23] There is no enmity.
[24:25] No.
[24:27] You give this to me.
[24:29] I will show it to Usman…when he comes.
[24:31] Yes.
[24:32] I swear
[24:33] the inflation rate is so high,
[24:35] it’s hard to manage.
[24:36] It’s a big problem.
[24:38] Do look after it.
[24:40] Ok?
[24:43] Give my love to Aliya.
[24:45] I pray for her a lot.
[24:48] Sure.
[24:49] She needs your prayers a lot.
[24:55] Ok then.
[24:56] Ok.
[24:57] I shall leave.
[25:05] Aunty!
[25:07] I have peeped into each and every house.
[25:09] She is nowhere.
[25:10] I don’t know where would she have gone?
[25:12] I can’t understand.
[25:15] Hmm.
[25:18] She came to get a hint.
[25:21] Aliya is indeed at her place.
[25:24] Who?
[25:25] Maryam Aunty?
[25:27] No way.
[25:28] She can’t go there.
[25:29] She can do anything.
[25:31] Haven’t you guys understood it by now?
[25:56] You have dropped me to a shelter, now go.
[26:05] Are you safe here?
[26:09] I am not your responsibility, Ibrahim.
[26:13] Whatever you have done for me,
it was not obligatory on you.
[26:18] But I am thankful to you.
[26:23] You may go now.
[26:28] I am dragging myself, I can’t bear your burden along.
[26:36] Look….
[26:42] I talked to you about divorce
that as soon as we arrive…
[26:45] There will be no divorce.
[26:50] This marriage will hold Shabbir and me back.
[26:59] Go.
[27:05] Ok.
[27:21] Yousuf!
[27:22] Yousuf!
[27:24] Yousuf!
[27:26] Didn’t I say that there is no need to go there.
[27:28] We have made them suspicious.
[27:31] What has happened?
[27:32] Oh! His Mother is a very sharp lady.
[27:35] You may say that she is about to arrive here.
[28:34] Uncle!
[28:40] Usman dear.
[28:42] Welcome!
[28:46] I feel so good.
[28:48] You have made me meet Yaseen’s
fragrance after a long time dear.
[28:52] How are you?
[28:54] Are you alright?
[28:57] What is it? Have you started dieting?
[29:00] You used to eat the others share as well.
[29:02] All is well….What about you Uncle?
[29:05] God has been great.
[29:08] He has been great.
[29:09] Aunty came over to our house with the bill.
[29:12] Oh man, she is so hasty for no reason….
[29:15] If she will watch TV the whole night…
[29:18] The amount of the bill is bound to rise
[29:24] He is Aliya’s husband.
[29:27] Our…
[29:29] Oh! That’s great.
[29:32] Today…God has
[29:34] blessed us with two joys…
[29:36] Where are they?
[29:39] Where are they?
[30:00] Come dear, come, come.
[30:02] This is your own house.
[30:04] It’s no problem.
[30:23] Yousuf!
[30:24] What is the matter?
[30:26] Usman dear, is everything alright?
[30:57] Look around properly dear,
satisfy yourself completely.
[31:06] Uncle, a man can hide…
[31:10] But his fragrance cannot.
[31:14] The whole church was filled
with the fragrance of perfume,
[31:17] if you don't believe me, you may ask someone else.
[31:24] Ibrahim was there.
[31:27] And if Ibrahim was there…
[31:31] Then Aliya was also there.
[32:20] Is this lady traveling with you, Brother?
[32:28] Hey Brother!
[32:29] What is your relation with her?
[32:34] Brother…he is my husband.
[32:36] Is he your husband?
[32:38] Then why are you sitting so far apart?
[32:39] Get closer.
[32:40] Another passenger will sit there.
[32:42] Come on, come on…get up from there, come on.
[32:44] Sit, sit, sit.
[32:45] Come, come, come.
[32:47] Come, come, sit.
[32:49] Sir, make the lady passengers sit in the front.
[33:06] Where is she?
[33:07] Tell me.
[33:07] Dear, listen to me.
[33:08] Tell me, where is she?
[33:09] Listen to me.
[33:10] Dear, listen to me, listen to me.
[33:13] Look, if the wife is upset, she doesn’t hide.
[33:16] She would sit in front of you with a long face…
[33:18] With her knees on her husband’s chest.
[33:20] And till he doesn’t please her, she doesn’t get up from there.
[33:22] No matter how upset Aliya is…
[33:25] How can she come here?
[33:26] She has not stepped in here,
[33:28] after her Father’s martyrdom.
[33:29] You keep quiet lady…keep quiet.
[33:31] And you know everything.
[33:32] Tell me, where is she?
[33:33] Brother, wait, wait.
[33:34] Let me speak.
[33:35] Uncle…
[33:37] You are like her Father.
[33:38] How can you tolerate that she
runs away with someone else?
[33:41] She has not runaway…
[33:43] She has gone with her husband.
[33:46] She went away with the man, she was married to.
[33:48] She is my wife.
[33:50] She is my wife.
[33:52] Look son!
[33:57] can’t help you more than keeping my mouth shut.
[34:01] What you have done…
[34:03] I will not tell anyone.
[34:06] I can’t do anything further for you.
[34:10] Aliya’s Father was martyred serving this place of worship.
[34:18] So, for his daughter…
[34:21] I can die.
[34:24] The rest is up to you.
[34:26] You want to shoot me?
[34:27] Shoot me.
[35:02] Maula Daad!
[35:05] Oh!
[35:07] Maula Daad!
[35:10] Hey, Maula Daad!
[35:13] Maula!
[35:15] Where has he disappeared?
[35:17] They have hired all the lazy people…here only.
[35:23] Anita!
[35:25] Hey Anita!
[35:29] Anita!
[35:32] Where were you?
[35:34] Is this how you guard?
[35:35] You left the door open and you disappeared.
[35:37] I went to buy groceries for Bushra Madam.
[35:39] What do you mean by Bushra Madam’s groceries?
[35:40] Look…
[35:41] if Anita is upstairs or has
she left early in the morning?
[35:43] She must be in her room.
[35:44] Then go and check her quickly.
[35:46] What?
[35:47] Come on, leave from here.
[35:50] Bushra Madam’s groceries!
[35:56] Yes, Yousuf Brother.
[35:58] Yes, yes.
[36:00] Is everything ok?
[36:03] I have sent him.
[36:05] I will inform you once he is back.
[36:07] I will inform you.
[36:13] Yes.
[36:14] All the girls are the same.
[36:16] They go to sleep with ear phones in the ears.
[36:19] Whether it's a storm, a whirlwind, or an earthquake…
[36:21] They remain completely unaware.
[36:23] I will inform, only when I get some information.
[36:26] Yes.
[36:31] Yes Aunty!
[36:34] Why aren’t you answering the phone?
[36:36] I was sleeping. My shift ended at 6 o’clock.
[36:38] I had a night shift.
[36:40] Call at your home.
[36:41] It’s an emergency.
[36:42] They are calling repeatedly.
[36:44] What?
[36:56] Greetings Father, sorry, my phone was on mute mode, what’s the emergency, is Mother alright?
