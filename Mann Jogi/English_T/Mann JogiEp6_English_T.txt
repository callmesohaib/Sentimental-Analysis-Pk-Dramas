[01:43] Ok listen.
[01:45] Don’t make any more mistakes.
[01:46] Whatever I am telling you…You will say that only.
[01:48] You both have come here in search of work.
[01:50] Someone fed you something on your way and you both got unconscious…
[01:53] He stole everything and left…
[01:54] ID card, money, clothes, everything.
[01:57] Ok?
[01:58] Hey! Let me, let me do this.
[02:00] Let me do this, I will do it.
[02:01] No, I am doing it.
[02:02] You take care of these clothes, I will do it.
[02:03] I am doing it.
[02:03] It’s no problem, I know how to do it.
[02:05] Actually, it is supposed to be like this from here, like this…
[02:09] And…this is ready.
[02:12] I never knew how to do this task, I used to get scolded too on this task.
[02:15] I only know how to do this.
[02:17] I will take care of it.
[02:20] Hmm
[02:27] Ibrahim!
[02:28] Mop inside as well, it’s very dirty
[02:32] Ibrahim!
[02:35] Madam has asked not to go inside.
[02:39] Give it to me, you go.
[02:42] You tell me, what to do, I will do it.
[02:44] Come.
[03:00] What happened? Is everything ok?
[03:01] It’s very dirty.
[03:07] You give me your stole.
[03:10] Give it to me, give it to me, give me your stole.
[03:11] Why?
[03:12] Give it to me, don’t question me.
[03:13] Why?
[03:17] Give this to me.
[03:18] No Ibrahim, I will do it.
[03:20] I will do it, you will not do this.
[03:20] You leave it please, leave it, I will do it.
[03:22] I said, you will not do it, you give it to me.
[03:23] Why not?
[03:26] Because you are very respectable…And this
[03:28] And this task doesn’t suit you.
[03:30] And because I am present here.
[03:33] I will do it, I am an expert in this task.
[03:35] This is just one, there were four in the mosque.
[03:37] Its not a problem, I will do it.
[03:39] I will take care of it.
[03:40] Hey! It’s not a problem.
[03:59] He has found this from the washroom.
[04:24] Should I…
[04:28] Tell you something?
[04:29] Hmm…tell me.
[04:33] Actually
[04:35] You cook potatoes with spinach very well.
[04:39] Just potato with spinach?
[04:40] No.
[04:41] Mutton gravy, lady finger with meat, potato with minced meat…
[04:46] You cook everything very well but…
[04:50] The carrot pudding that you make…
[04:53] That is very, very good by God’s grace.
[04:56] You know, ever since the food started coming from your side…
[05:01] The taste of the meals had completely changed.
[05:04] Cleric Sir also used to praise your food a lot.
[05:20] May I tell you one more thing?
[05:23] Now, you must tell me.
[05:26] Once, because of you…
[05:29] I had to cheat big time.
[05:31] May God forgive me.
[05:33] Do you remember, once you sent carrot pudding?
[05:36] I ate all of it, secretly in my room.
[05:39] And
[05:40] I did not tell Cleric Sir that you had sent carrot pudding.
[05:44] Do you even know how to lie?
[05:46] No.
[05:48] But when the pudding comes before me…
[05:51] I lose my mind, God knows what happens to me.
[05:58] When will you cook it again?
[06:07] These might be of some use to both of you…
[06:15] Thank you!
[06:26] No, I will take these.
[06:27] No, give it to me, give it to me.
[06:33] The clothes are nice.
[06:35] Hmm.
[06:35] I will go put them.
[06:58] You look nice.
[07:01] Thank you!
[07:16] You also look nice.
[07:19] Without looking?
[07:21] No, I did see you.
[07:28] Ibrahim!
[07:30] Take a look, you won’t become a sinner.
[07:32] I am your lawful wife.
[07:35] Yes…
[07:39] It’s the first time, I have seen a girl…
[07:43] So closely.
[07:49] Let’s go and cook food, come.
[07:51] Aliya Madam!
[07:55] In these clothes?
[07:57] Yes.
[07:59] People cook, wearing such clothes in big hotels.
[08:03] No…
[08:04] Uh
[08:05] I will come when my clothes dry up.
[08:08] What is wrong with these?
[08:11] It doesn’t look nice.
[08:12] It feels weird,
[08:13] it’s the first time I am wearing pants.
[08:15] I am not habitual.
[08:17] But I am saying you look nice.
[08:21] You did not even look at me and said that I am looking nice and I agreed.
[08:26] I am looking at you so closely and telling you… That you look nice…
[08:30] You don’t believe it.
[08:34] I do believe.
[08:36] Let’s go then.
[08:40] Let’s go.
[08:52] Ahan! Love birds.
[08:56] What…
[08:57] What does it mean, what was she saying?
[08:59] She was praising.
[09:09] I knew it…
[09:10] That these clothes will fit both of you.
[09:13] We also were slim like both of you…smart.
[09:17] You look nice.
[09:20] Oh!
[09:23] God knows, when will this knee pain end?
[09:27] Election is just a game.
[09:30] If, we have lost today then we will win tomorrow.
[09:33] But politics is not a game.
[09:36] Politics is life.
[09:38] Brother, the one who loses this, consider him dead.
[09:43] Election is a trophy.
[09:46] If we don’t get it today then we will get it tomorrow.
[09:49] But politics…
[09:51] Politics is an image, it’s an image.
[09:53] Do you understand what is an image?
[09:56] Love!
[09:57] Affection!
[09:59] Trust!
[10:01] Faith!
[10:03] Respect!
[10:04] Esteem!
[10:05] Which people have for you in their hearts.
[10:09] Once it ends…
[10:11] No trophy can bring it back.
[10:14] And anyways…
[10:15] We have just lost an ordinary committee election of the market
[10:20] No election is ordinary, Sir.
[10:23] It leaves a great impact.
[10:24] When did I say not to get affected?
[10:27] Do get affected.
[10:28] Get affected for sure.
[10:30] Keep your spirits high, instead of getting disheartened.
[10:34] Look at your mistakes and weaknesses.
[10:37] Prepare for the bigger elections.
[10:40] In fact, I think, Chaudry Zubair…
[10:43] Should get a congratulations message from Chaudry Shabbir.
[10:48] Huh
[10:49] Messages of congratulations are being sent through back door, Comrade…
[10:52] And…
[10:55] Sister in law also reached there with the sweets.
[10:58] Oh, no, no, no, no, leave him.
[11:00] Women of the family are not supposed to be mentioned in the politics.
[11:02] Oh, come on, Mr. Chaudry!
[11:03] How dare you take her name?
[11:05] Oh let it go…Relax…
[11:06] Calm down.
[11:12] Wow! Great!
[11:13] Awesome!
[11:16] Aliya Madam, may I tell you something?
[11:19] You cook potatoes with spinach…
[11:21] very well.
[11:26] You cook this so well that if you cook it every day, I can eat it every day.
[11:30] And if you cook it three or four times a day…
[11:33] I will eat it even then.
[11:37] Shabbir also liked it a lot.
[11:40] He used to make requests every other day or so.
[11:43] His Mother had handed over the whole kitchen over to Noora.
[11:47] She would cook just for the sake of it and leave.
[11:53] So, now…
[11:57] Will they ever be…
[12:00] blessed by the food cooked by you?
[12:05] Are you asking me or are you asking yourself?
[12:13] I can’t even think about this, even if I were dead.
[12:20] Even if you die, Shabbir will not be so lucky to have food made by me.
[12:49] This is the main line…
[12:51] And this is the hot wire…
[12:52] Which brings the current.
[12:54] Which one?
[12:55] This one, right?
[12:57] Yes, this one.
[12:58] And this one is the cold.
[13:01] OK.
[13:03] And this is the cold wire.
[13:04] What else do you teach him?
[13:07] Cut it from here.
[13:08] How did you both get married?
[13:11] Was it love or arrange?
[13:13] I guess, it was arranged.
[13:15] Your parents must have forced him upon you.
[13:19] Its good that he is at least helping you.
[13:22] Mine was a big loser.
[13:28] He used to sit at home and enjoy free meals.
[13:31] I left him within a year.
[13:33] It's better to keep a dog or a cat than have a husband like that.
[13:37] At least they wag their tales when their stomach is full.
[13:41] I have put the clothes….
[13:43] for laundry.
[13:45] I will pay the due amount.
[13:48] Listen!
[13:52] We both had a love marriage.
[13:54] We went against everyone and got married.
[13:57] Where are the clothes?
[13:59] I have put them.
[14:08] Which is the hot and the cold wire?
[14:12] Which is the hot wire?
[14:17] I forgot.
[14:19] Aliya is not home.
[14:21] I have come from her brother’s house…
[14:22] She is not there too.
[14:25] Why are you looking for her?
[14:26] I have something important to discuss with her.
[14:29] Baalay!
[14:30] Enough of this! Leave from here.
[14:33] This is the trait of a person with a higher status.
[14:36] He picks up the indirect hints.
[14:39] Shabbir brother…
[14:40] Her friend has been diagnosed with cancer.
[14:43] She wants to meet her once.
[14:46] We will inform her, once she is back.
[14:48] What have we women got to do with your politics?
[14:51] You both may settle scores as you wish.
[14:53] We have been friends even before this.
[14:55] Hey Baalay!
[14:56] You are still standing here, haven’t you left?
[14:58] Come on, get out!
[15:00] This is the problem of people from the lower cast.
[15:02] They don’t understand something said repeatedly.
[15:04] Get going.
[15:04] Are you leaving or should l come?
[15:06] Come on leave from here, get out!
[15:08] Cheap man!
[15:15] Maula daad brother!
[15:17] Will you bring this from outside?
[15:18] I am badly stuck with my assignment.
[15:20] Sister! The outside chores are not my responsibility anymore.
[15:25] He is sitting over there, send him.
[15:27] Bringing groceries, is his duty now.
[15:34] Ok!
[15:35] So, Mr. Ibrahim will be responsible for the external duties now.
[15:39] Will you be able to handle it?
[15:41] Yes.
[15:42] Come on, go and bring this.
[15:44] Room no 204.
[15:48] Which room?
[15:50] 204.
[15:51] Repeat
[15:53] 204.
[15:55] Get going, bring it quickly.
[16:14] Ibrahim, grab a basket.
[16:29] This is called a basket.
[16:54] Ibrahim, here you go.
[16:57] Give it to me, give it to me, I will do it, give it to me.
[16:58] Give it to me, I will do it.
[16:59] Forget it…Lady
[17:00] I went outside, and I got late.
[17:01] You just go and see where is your husband.
[17:03] He might get lost.
[17:05] They are enjoying so much, Aunty.
[17:07] They are dating 24 hours.
[17:09] From cleaning to grocery…
[17:11] They are always glued together, it’s a limit.
[17:14] And let me tell you something.
[17:16] No matter how much you punish them…
[17:18] They are happy with it.
[17:20] Aliya!
[17:21] What am I listening to?
[17:24] Don’t do this again.
[17:26] Bushra Madam, shouldn’t get a chance to complain.
[17:29] I am saying this for the last time.
[17:31] You go, she will do it and bring it.
[17:37] Ibrahim can’t do groceries.
[17:40] He has spent all his life in the mosque, he doesn’t have the experience.
[17:44] What do you want now?
[17:47] Should he spend all his life in a hostel?
[17:50] You are not being fair to him.
[18:01] Aliya Madam!
[18:03] Hmm.
[18:05] You must be thinking…
[18:09] That what a big loser I am.
[18:12] Useless!
[18:14] No.
[18:16] I don’t think like that at all.
[18:19] Thanks a lot.
[18:24] Otherwise, the rest of them think the same way.
[18:30] You are upset with what Bushra has said, right?
[18:33] No.
[18:38] I don’t mind anything, anybody says.
[18:42] Only you matter the most to me.
[18:45] And I feel scared that you might get offended by something I say.
[18:50] If you mind something…
[18:53] God knows, what will I do.
[18:59] Ibrahim, have you always been like this?
[19:02] I mean…
[19:04] Anxious, frightened, nervous….. and a useless person.
[19:08] No, no.
[19:10] I was not saying this.
[19:12] If you are a useless person then everybody should be like you.
[19:15] The world will become a better place.
[19:17] I mean, simple.
[19:21] No.
[19:23] You know,
[19:24] I used to be very sharp in my childhood.
[19:26] My Grandmother had named me magic.
[19:30] Because I was beyond anyone’s grasp.
[19:32] I used to move my hands and legs so much while sleeping
[19:34] that people used to think that I might runaway somewhere.
[19:37] There was a hotel on the mountain top.
[19:41] Then our house.
[19:43] Below that was a bazaar.
[19:47] I would roam around all day long.
[19:50] Sometimes the hotel and then to the bazaar.
[19:54] I was aware of everything.
[19:57] What is there in the cabinet of which shop…
[20:00] Who has come into the hotel to stay? Where has he come from? I knew everything.
[20:04] My Grandmother used to say…
[20:07] That you will become a bigger guide than your Father.
[20:10] You will take people on a tour of every nook and corner of Kashmir.
[20:15] But…
[20:20] The earthquake destroyed it all.
[20:24] Kashmir…
[20:28] and my magic too.
[20:37] This is why I am like this today.
[20:51] Come, come Mr. Chaudry.
[20:54] All good? What brings you here?
[20:59] The Cleric of our mosque has filed a complaint.
[21:04] The muezzin of the mosque has stolen the charity money and fled.
[21:07] Oh, yes.
[21:09] Rafaqat!
[21:12] Rafaqat!
[21:14] Listen to what Mr. Chaudry has to say….
[21:16] Mr. Chaudry, I shall take your leave.
[21:17] The SSP has called an emergency meeting.
[21:19] What should I talk to the supervisor about Mr. SHO?
[21:23] It’s been a week the complaint has been filed and you don’t even know about it.
[21:27] Mr. Chaudry, within a week, a petrol pump has been robbed,
[21:31] two murders have been committed…
[21:32] And three VIP duties have been assigned.
[21:36] Petrol pump…
[21:39] VIP movement!
[21:42] Are you comparing the petrol pump with a mosque?
[21:49] Rafaqat!
[21:50] Go.
[21:54] No, Mr. Chaudry.
[21:56] I am not comparing it.
[21:58] You are…
[21:59] You surely are comparing it.
[22:02] If you are not comparing it but you are giving it equal importance as that of a mosque.
[22:10] I did not mean this, I am just telling you about my commitment.
[22:13] Mosque should be above all, Mr. SHO.
[22:18] Above all.
[22:22] Theft of even a single rupee from the mosque…
[22:25] Is worth more than the crores stolen from a petrol pump.
[22:31] You are right.
[22:33] But what I mean to say is that…
[22:34] You don’t catch the thieves of the mosques…
[22:39] This is why the petrol pumps get robbed.
[22:44] Mr. SHO, all your focus…
[22:48] Should be on the mosque’s thief.
[22:52] Otherwise, I have other ways to draw your focus.
[23:08] Ibrahim!
[23:08] Yes.
[23:10] We are playing a game today.
[23:12] Let’s see who wins the game?
[23:14] Here…
[23:15] The items mentioned in this list…
[23:17] I will bring half of it and you will bring the other half.
[23:20] It’s all here.
[23:22] And whoever ….
[23:23] At the counter ….
[23:25] reaches here first…
[23:26] Will win.
[23:27] Ok?
[23:36] Here you go.
[23:37] Hold it.
[23:38] Let me bring the trolley.
[23:52] Go and bring the trolley.
[23:53] Where will the money come from?
[23:56] Bilqees Aunty will give it.
[23:57] From where?
[23:59] I don’t know from where, its her problem, you go and bring the trolley.
[24:03] Ok don’t go, I am going to get it.
[24:05] Where will I meet you?
[24:07] Here, at this counter…
[24:08] You will find me.
[24:10] Ok bye!
[24:11] Aliya Madam!
[24:13] Yes.
[24:16] I will not be able to do it, I am not getting it, I am just…
[24:19] If you can’t do it then get lost.
[24:36] Aliya Madam!
[26:14] Ibrahim!
[26:15] Ibrahim!
[26:19] Ibrahim!
[26:25] Ibrahim!
[26:54] Bilqees Aunty!
[26:57] Bilqees Aunty!
[27:00] Bilqees Aunty!
[27:03] Bilqees Aunty, Anita!
[27:05] Bilqees aunty!
[27:06] What happened?
[27:09] What happened? why are you crying?
[27:10] Why are you crying so bitterly?
[27:12] Tell me, why are you crying? why are you getting distressed?
[27:15] Aunty, Ibrahim has left.
[27:18] Where?
[27:18] I don’t know.
[27:21] Anita, call Anita.
[27:25] Where can he go? Did you have a fight with him?
[27:27] I asked him to get lost.
[27:31] Where can he go?
[27:32] He can’t move even a little without you.
[27:35] He will really get lost, he will get lost, he will die, he has no one except me in this world.
[27:40] Bilqees Aunty!
[27:41] Ok, ok, ok.
[27:43] Did you have a fight?
[27:45] I also can’t move without him, I can’t move even a single step, I swear upon God, Aunty…
[27:51] Bilqees Aunty, I will work for you for free all my life, I will serve you, please, look for Ibrahim, find him.
[27:58] Ok, ok, ok, ok.
[28:00] Listen, listen, listen to me.
[28:02] Listen, stop, stop crying, quiet and listen to me.
[28:05] Listen to me.
[28:06] If I find him…
[28:08] Then you will not leave this hostel for the rest of your life.
[28:11] Ok?
[28:12] Even if your punishment is over.
[28:14] I will not leave, I will not leave, I swear, I will not leave.
[28:16] Stand by your words then.
[28:18] Ok?
[28:18] I will, I will not go anywhere, find him.
[28:19] Bilqees Aunty, call Anita.
[28:22] Ok, ok, ok, ok.
[28:22] Come on, lets look for him, let’s find him, let’s do it.
[28:25] Stop crying.
[28:26] Let’s go.
[28:27] Ibrahim!
[28:30] Ibrahim!
[28:31] Come.
[28:32] Your wife can’t move even a little without you.
[28:35] Where were you?
[28:37] Where did you go, where did you go?
[28:40] He came with me.
[28:41] Crazy girl, you left him in the mall, he was wandering there.
[28:45] If I would not have had met him, he would have had got lost in actual.
[28:51] I thought, you left me.
[29:18] I thought that you left me…Ibrahim
[29:44] Do you have a doubt on anyone other than Ibrahim?
[29:49] Everything…
[29:50] was under Ibrahim’s control.
[29:53] There's no point in suspecting anyone else except him.
[29:58] Isn’t it, Cleric Sir?
[30:03] Hmm.
[30:06] This seems like a problem.
[30:09] Seems like a big problem.
[30:11] A person, who has never seen the world outside the mosque…
[30:17] Surely, someone else must have shown him this way.
[30:21] Have to make it broad.
[30:25] The circle of investigation….
[30:26] needs to be broadened.
[30:28] And Mr. Chaudry…
[30:29] For that, I need your co-operation.
[30:36] At your service, Mr. SHO.
[30:47] Father used to do the same with me.
[30:51] He would make me face the things, I was afraid of.
[30:58] I was scared of height,
[31:00] so he would take me to heights…
[31:03] Would make me sit on high swings.
[31:07] I was afraid of the streets, so he would take me to the market and then disappear himself.
[31:12] Then I used to find a way home on my own.
[31:17] I was scared of the dark,
[31:19] so he would take me to the graveyard saying that we have to recite prayer.
[31:26] This is why, I am not scared anymore.
[31:31] Neither of the heights…
[31:34] Nor of new paths or the dark
[31:42] But I got scared today, Ibrahim.
[31:46] I felt very scared.
[31:52] As if, while showing you the path…I…
[31:56] I lost track of my own way.
[32:02] And there is only darkness ahead.
[32:07] I got scared of this darkness.
[32:13] I got very scared.
[32:16] When after the earthquake…
[32:19] I reached my village…
[32:23] There was a heap of plunder there.
[32:27] Everything was submerged…
[32:30] Except for one hand that was outside.
[32:35] My Mother’s.
[32:38] Under a big stone.
[32:45] I kept sitting there, holding that hand.
[32:49] Kept crying…
[32:52] Until I was conscious.
[32:55] Then I fainted.
[33:00] When I regained consciousness…then I…
[33:04] I was in a bus.
[33:07] I was in the Cleric Sir’s lap.
[33:12] I cried a lot that day.
[33:14] I cried bitterly.
[33:18] For that hand.
[33:26] And even today…
[33:30] I felt like crying the same way.
[34:36] By the way, what is the difference between you and the Cleric Sir?
[34:40] He also was showing him the right path.
[34:42] Then one day, he asked him to leave the right path.
[34:47] You should treat him like a student or an assistant, which is his rightful place.
[34:53] He will understand all the ways in a single day and he will become mature too.
[34:58] Can’t you see the danger I am facing?
[35:00] I can see that but you also become brave.
[35:06] If he would have been so weak, he would not have been with me.
[35:09] He is with you…
[35:11] But are you with him?
[35:14] Look, I have noticed that both of you share a very insecure relationship.
[35:17] Anyone can abandon anyone, at any time.
[35:20] He also has a fear and you also are scared.
[35:22] What is this?
[35:25] Look, whatever has happened with both of you…
[35:27] That was an accident.
[35:29] You have to build a relationship…
[35:31] Only then you can come out of that accident.
[35:35] And this is not only my idea…
[35:37] Mother and Father also think the same.
[35:45] Allah has planted the fragrant seed of love in my heart.
[36:10] Your voice is very nice.
[36:14] Do you know only one song?
[36:17] It’s not a song…
[36:19] It’s spiritual poetry.
[36:34] Oh, my beloved! Without you…
[36:38] My heart doesn't feel content.
[36:42] Oh, my beloved! There is no one, more charming than you.
[36:51] Wherever I might be…
[36:54] I think about you only.
[36:58] Don’t ask me about where my heart is…
[37:02] It’s always with you.
[37:07] The pain of parting from you…
[37:10] Only my heart knows or God knows.
[37:30] Here you go.
[37:33] What is this for?
[37:34] Keep it.
[37:35] It’s for you.
[37:37] I charge 50 rupees for laundry, for a single suit from every girl.
[37:42] Cost price is 20 rupees.
[37:44] The rest 30 rupees, are yours.
[37:48] I am not that tyrant.
[37:51] I have to act strict…
[37:54] Otherwise, these girls can’t be controlled.
[37:59] Thank you!
[38:03] Listen!
[38:05] Your punishment is ending next Sunday.
[38:08] I hope, you remember your promise?
[38:11] I will not make you work for free.
[38:16] You have paid me even now
[38:27] Oh, my beloved! Without you…
[38:30] My heart doesn't feel content.
[38:34] Oh, my beloved! There is no one, more charming than you.
[38:41] Wherever I might be…
[38:48] Hmhmhmhmhmhm.
[38:51] Don’t ask me about where my heart is…
[38:55] It’s always with you.
[38:59] The pain of parting from you…
[39:02] My heart doesn't feel content.
