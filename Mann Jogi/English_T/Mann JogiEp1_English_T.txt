[01:53] God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
[02:02] God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
[02:18] Aliya!
[02:19] Aliya!
[02:21] Aliya!
[02:22] Leave all this.
[02:23] It’s getting late, hurry up.
[02:26] Leave it, I am talking to you Aliya.
[02:33] Don’t look at me like this.
[02:37] My heart sinks.
[02:49] Get up, let’s go.
[02:50] Get up.
[02:51] Get up.
[02:53] Get up.
[02:55] Let’s go.
[03:49] Ibrahim!
[03:52] Ibrahim!
[03:56] Forgive me Sir, it slipped by mistake,
I was just a little…
[03:58] I don’t know how it slipped from my hand, it slipped…
[04:00] I will just go and refill it.
[04:02] Apologies, I will refill it, Sir.
[04:05] I am very scared Sir.
[04:09] My heart is feeling very anxious.
[04:11] I can’t figure out anything.
[04:13] Don’t get nervous dear.
[04:17] He will fix everything.
[04:21] You go…
[04:24] Change your clothes.
[04:28] Tidy up your room.
[04:34] Is there no other way out?
[06:24] Shabbir!
[06:38] You should have taken her to the parlor.
[06:41] Nothing should have been missing.
[06:43] She was sitting like a living dead.
[06:45] I took her from the kitchen to the dressing table.
[06:52] It was necessary Shabbir.
[06:54] Don’t increase my suffering any further Mother.
[06:57] Don’t do this.
[07:05] The suffering is mutual.
[07:08] All of us have to bear it.
[08:41] Madam Aliya…
[08:44] Daughter of…
[08:47] Mohammad Yaseen.
[08:48] Mohammad Yaseen.
[08:51] Do you accept this marriage…
[08:55] Against a dowry amount of…
[08:59] Ten thousand rupees Pakistani….
[09:07] With...
[09:10] Mohammad Ibrahim…
[09:13] Son of, Mohammad Riaz…
[09:16] Do you accept?
[09:19] Yes, she does.
[09:29] Aliya!
[09:37] Aliya!
[09:39] I do.
[09:43] He does.
[10:00] A woman has to make a lot of
sacrifices to save her house.
[10:08] Tonight…
[10:10] Will be like doomsday for Shabbir…
[10:14] And for me too.
[10:17] Just…
[10:20] Just…
[10:22] Spend this single night…
[10:25] Then tomorrow it will be you…
[10:28] And your heaven.
[10:47] Shabbir!
[11:07] Ibrahim!
[11:10] After morning prayers.
[11:35] Hey!
[11:36] What has happened to you?
[11:37] Hey!
[11:38] Get up!
[11:39] Get up from here, don’t create a scene, get up.
[11:41] Enough my son, get up.
[11:43] Get up, come on, let’s go home.
[11:45] Come on, get up.
[11:46] Get up, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
[11:52] Hurry up dear.
[11:55] Time is short.
[11:59] It’s going to be dawn in a while.
[13:06] I am here to give the dower amount.
[13:25] She should be at my home before morning prayers.
[14:25] Great injustice has been done, Mother.
[14:29] Great injustice has been done, Mother.
[14:37] I have…
[14:39] My own Aliya…
[14:40] I gave the dower amount to my Aliya, Mother.
[14:45] Mother!
[14:46] Stop it, stop it,
[14:48] stop it my son.
[14:49] I went to give the dower amount, Mother.
[14:51] Mother: Stop it, stop it my son, enough!
[15:32] How will I meet…?
[15:37] My parents…
[15:39] My siblings…
[15:44] My friends…
[15:51] My Grandmother.
[15:58] Obviously, they all will go to heaven.
[16:06] I will go to hell.
[16:13] Brother did wrong.
[16:16] He was very unfair to me.
[16:20] I tried to explain him that it is wrong,
[16:24] It is a lie…
[16:25] It’s a theft.
[16:26] It’s a joke with the followers of God.
[16:36] But he did not agree.
[16:41] Now, I am the one who will suffer the punishment.
[16:44] I am the one, who will go to hell.
[16:52] All my good deeds are wasted.
[16:55] All my efforts have turned to dust.
[17:00] These prayers and calls to prayers
will be returned to me.
[17:04] Do you know…
[17:08] For the last fifteen years, every day…
[17:12] I have swept the mosque…
[17:15] Have washed the Religious scholar’s feet…
[17:16] Have fixed people’s shoes, for what, so that I may go to heaven, to meet my loved ones,
[17:20] who were martyred in the earthquake.
[17:22] Only I escaped.
[17:26] For this misfortune?
[17:38] The sad part is that…
[17:44] The Religious scholar also did not listen to me
[17:49] He restricted me.
[17:54] How could I ignore his command?
[17:58] He has brought me up like a Father.
[18:04] I tried to run away from there…
[18:07] To save myself from this sin but I couldn’t.
[18:11] Where would have I gone?
[18:13] I don’t know any place other than the mosque and this neighborhood…
[18:15] And even if I had been courageous enough and left…
[18:18] Then how the Religious scholar
would have had survived?
[18:22] We are supposedly in the house of God, but at the mercy of His people.
[18:29] I am destroyed.
[18:31] My life is ruined.
[18:34] I am destroyed.
[18:38] How am I going to face?
[18:46] Ibrahim, shut the door.
[18:55] Shut the door.
[19:00] Shut the door.
[19:48] The light too.
[19:49] What?
[20:01] Aa…
[20:03] Look, I had told the Religious scholar that I can only get married and I can’t go beyond that.
[20:09] I respect you a lot… You are a very good person but…
[20:13] We shouldn’t go beyond this.
[20:15] God’s severe punishment will befall us anyways, for this grave sin we have committed.
[20:19] We should not go beyond this.
[20:21] I don’t want to be cursed by God anymore.
[20:23] Aaaa…
[20:24] Neither will I be able to meet my parents, nor…
[20:25] Aaa….
[20:56] Do you know since when have you been my bride?
[21:00] Do you remember sister Waheeda’s wedding?
[21:06] You…back then…were in class 9th then,
I guess, right?
[21:12] Which song did you give a dance performance on?
[21:15] Hey boy! Hey boy, leave my stole…
[21:20] Isn’t it?
[21:21] You acted like a boy and danced with a girl.
[21:24] Give me water.
[21:27] I told Mother that very day…
[21:29] That I will get married to you only,
give me water, give me water.
[21:33] Your brother had created quite a fuss.
[21:36] He said that it was his late Father’s wish that our Aliya becomes an engineer.
[21:43] Don’t worry.
[21:46] Hmm.
[21:51] Its ok.
[21:52] Hold it, hold it.
[21:55] I will fulfill your Father’s wish.
[22:02] You will give the exams sitting on this bed only.
[22:05] After all, you are Chaudry Shabbir’s wife.
[22:10] You are not an ordinary girl, isn’t it?
[22:15] Oho!
[22:19] Forget it Shabbir, it’s a little tight.
[22:22] No problem, it will fit.
[22:28] It is slightly stuck…That’s all
[22:36] Oh my God!
[22:38] He must have got it made himself…
[22:39] That’s why the size is a little small, especially for you.
[22:42] Oh my God! That naughty has got his
name engraved too.
[22:45] I did not notice.
[22:48] It must have struck his mind.
[22:51] If something strikes his mind…
[22:53] Then…
[22:54] Regardless of what happens in the world…
[22:57] He has to fulfill his will.
[22:58] Oh my God, what are you doing?
[23:00] Aunty, the engraved letters are hurting.
[23:02] Oh, no problem dear.
[23:04] It’s a little hard in the beginning then
one becomes habitual.
[23:07] Its ok, its ok.
[23:10] Have some biscuits.
[23:11] Shabbir is also the same.
[23:13] He is very nice.
[23:14] He is just a little strict.
[23:16] Have some tea.
[23:19] Leave it, have tea.
[23:21] You don’t worry Sir.
[23:23] Birds never perch on a tree, which is
brought in from outside.
[23:27] They also have brought Shabbir from outside and made him join politics …
[23:31] The ones whom Shabbir used to oblige.
[23:33] Otherwise, no one from his family knew anything about politics.
[23:37] Great Grandfather was a sergeant in army…
[23:39] Grandfather was a clerk in railways…
[23:41] His Father was a schoolteacher and
he,himself is illiterate.
[23:46] Yes, yes.
[23:50] He used to roam on the streets aimlessly.
[23:52] This is why his politics starts from the streets…
[23:57] And ends there.
[23:58] Chaudry Zubair!
[23:59] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:01] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:01] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:03] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:04] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:06] Your brother, my brother…
[24:08] Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
[24:10] Your brother, my brother…
[24:12] Chaudry Shabbir! Chaudry Shabbir!
[24:14] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:15] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:17] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:18] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:19] Hello mr. Sho.
[24:20] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:20] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:22] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:23] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:25] Chaudry Zubair!
[24:26] Shame on you! Shame on you!
[24:26] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[24:27] Move back.
[24:29] Hey! Move back!
[24:32] Hey! Move back!
[24:34] I hope you were not hurt.
[24:37] It’s a routine.
[24:41] Why do you become so angry?
[24:45] Anger is my weapon.
[24:49] It’s a very dangerous weapon.
[24:51] One sometimes injures himself too.
[25:01] Its fine with me.
[25:04] But nothing should happen to you, my love.
[25:08] If something happens to you…
[25:11] I will not tolerate.
[25:14] Shabbir!
[25:18] Be ready for every situation.
[25:20] You are a politician’s wife.
[25:23] Yes, Mother.
[25:26] Chaudry Zubair is here to meet you.
[25:44] Leader!
[26:04] No matter what…
[26:06] Mr. Chaudry has the style.
[26:09] Congratulations on your wedding.
[26:12] I have heard that we have become Brother in laws.
[26:16] You have married my wife’s friend.
[26:19] Seems like I have changed a lot, Mr. Chaudry.
[26:21] But she is still the same.
[26:23] Just like Kareem brother’s savory snack.
[26:25] One falls in love in a single glance.
[26:27] Bunty, greetings!
[26:30] How are you?
[26:31] I am absolutely fine.
[26:32] There you go.
[26:33] The friends have reunited.
[26:39] Wow Aalo!
[26:40] Your husband is crazy about you.
[26:42] He has filled the entire room with photographs.
[26:45] Bubbly shared your picture in the group.
[26:47] I saw you there.
[26:50] Where did she get it from?
[26:52] There you go.
[26:52] Photographs are not available
in the albums only these days.
[26:57] Where is Bubbly?
[26:58] She did not meet me after school.
[27:00] She must have got married in the
Chaudry family like me.
[27:02] Since she got married to Zubair’s cousin.
[27:05] Don’t tell me.
[27:06] Seriously?
[27:07] I swear.
[27:08] She danced so well in my wedding,
she danced so well…
[27:11] That the boy from my in-laws…
[27:13] Went crazy for her.
[27:15] She must have become fat like you too.
[27:17] Loaded with jewelry, Mrs. Chaudry.
[27:20] You also will become like that…
[27:21] When your husband will get a ministry.
[27:23] Come on, have some tea.
[27:24] Why are you so rude?
[27:27] You are always raging with anger.
[27:30] What are you angry about?
[27:35] All thanks to you, Mr. Chaudry.
[27:39] It’s all your love.
[27:42] I am just returning what I had collected.
[27:45] Things might have gotten a little messed up.
[27:47] I don’t remember anything.
[27:53] I remember everything.
[27:58] I have even set an alarm in my watch.
[28:02] Morning, afternoon, evening…
[28:05] Even if I forget…
[28:08] It rings up.
[28:11] Engage in politics…
[28:13] Don’t make enemies.
[28:15] You are new in this game.
[28:17] We have been doing this since four generations.
[28:22] The old stuff is not getting sold, Mr. Chaudry.
[28:27] That’s why you are sitting here.
[28:30] I have just brought my wife to meet
her friend, that’s it.
[28:33] That’s it.
[28:36] You won the move here.
[28:43] I do politics on my own.
[28:47] I don’t use my wife for my politics.
[29:00] Aah!
[29:03] Then you will keep getting beaten up…
[29:05] While showing off like this.
[29:07] I will wait.
[29:08] You have to come.
[29:10] God willing.
[29:12] You also do come.
[29:13] And do send her to my place.
[29:16] Ok?
[29:17] Bye!
[29:21] Bye!
[29:24] I get beaten up by her husband…
[29:26] And you are seeing her off happily.
[29:28] I am talking to you.
[29:29] Shabbir!
[29:30] You don’t interfere, it’s a husband
and wife personal matter.
[29:32] If it’s between the husband and wife
then it should stay inside…
[29:35] Your voice can be heard outside.
[29:39] Hey, are you deaf or have you lost your tongue?
[29:42] Shabbir…
[29:44] You know that it’s not my fault.
[29:46] Why are you doing this?
[29:47] And don’t bring this politics at home,
I’ll be grateful, please.
[29:50] You listen to me.
[29:52] When I am talking to you, you have to listen to me.
[29:54] Shabbir!
[29:55] And you will answer that too, do you get it?
[29:57] Shabbir its hurting.
[29:58] Shabbir!
[30:00] What have I done? Why are you humiliating me?
[30:02] The wounds you were trying to heal, you have rubbed salt on them, this is what you have done.
[30:06] What would I have had done then?
[30:07] How should I have seen off the guests?
[30:09] How should you have had seen them off?
[30:11] You should have seen her off like this.
[30:15] If you would have had kicked her out of the house…
[30:17] Only then I would have known that you feel my pain.
[30:20] From today onwards, if she steps in this house…
[30:23] I will not throw you on this bed…
[30:25] I will kick you out of this house.
[31:19] We used to play cricket in Chaudry Zubair’s street.
[31:25] One day, I hit a six and the ball went
straight into their bungalow.
[31:31] Now who would go to bring the ball…?
[31:34] Except Chaudry Shabbir.
[31:39] So, I went inside the bungalow confidently.
[31:46] The ball had…
[31:51] Spilled the tea, from the cup placed on the table.
[32:02] Lick it.
[32:08] Lick it.
[32:11] Lick it.
[32:18] Zubair’s Father, Chaudry Sohail said.
[32:25] Gave me a tight slap on my face.
[32:39] 1…
[32:40] Shabbir!
[32:41] 2…
[32:42] Sshhh…
[32:43] 3…
[32:45] 4…
[32:54] These slaps still hurt my face.
[33:02] He got me beaten up by his servants...
[33:07] And kicked me out of the bungalow…
[33:11] And that too empty handed.
[33:28] He is insulting me till date.
[33:35] He turned my victory into defeat in the elections.
[33:42] Oh!
[33:44] He has humiliated and disgraced me.
[34:29] Show some more for him, brother.
[34:35] You are doing shopping.
[34:38] Greetings!
[34:40] I hope, I have not caught you.
[34:43] What?
[34:45] Who is this handsome?
[34:46] He is Shabbir’s brother.
[34:48] Where did Shabbir’s brother come from?
[34:50] He is a foster brother.
[34:51] He is muezzin in the mosque nearby our house.
[34:53] What are you here for?
[34:54] Wait!
[34:55] I hope its not tight on your foot.
[34:57] Stand up and show me.
[34:59] Is it ok?
[35:01] Sit down…Ibrahim
[35:03] Show him another shoe.
[35:06] Listen!
[35:07] Hmm
[35:07] Your husband is sealing his own fate.
[35:10] Bunty, what rubbish?
[35:13] Listen brother…
[35:14] Hold this.
[35:15] You keep sitting here with this stuff.
[35:17] Madam is just coming, ok?
[35:19] Where?
[35:20] I have to talk about something important.
[35:21] Let’s go.
[35:22] Ibrahim…stay here
[35:23] Let’s go.
[35:23] Where?
[35:26] It will taste just like Kareem brother’s snacks…
[35:29] The one who used to have a stall outside our school.
[35:31] Was this your important thing?
[35:33] So, what?
[35:34] Friends rubbish is their important thing.
[35:37] Bunty, he doesn’t like me meeting you at
all…..He totally hates it.
[35:41] This is why I have come here to meet you.
[35:49] Hello!
[35:50] Yes Banjo!
[35:52] What?
[35:54] What are you saying?
[35:57] Oh my God!
[35:59] I left her healthy and happy.
[36:03] Oh, my daughter.
[36:04] Oh, my Zoyee!
[36:06] Aliya my Zoyee.
[36:09] Aliya my Zoyee has passed away.
[36:11] May God have mercy.
[36:13] My daughter has passed away.
[36:21] Zoyee!
[36:29] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[36:31] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[36:32] Long live!
[36:34] Long live!
[36:36] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[36:38] Long live! Chaudry Zubair!
[36:39] Long live!
[36:41] Long live!
[37:57] I divorce you!
[37:59] Oh Shabbir, no.
[38:00] Shabbir no.
[38:00] No Shabbir.
[38:01] I divorce you!
[38:03] Shabbir don’t do this.
[38:03] I divorce you!
[39:06] If I don’t drag him into these very own streets…
[39:09] Then I am not Chaudry Shabbir.
[39:12] Your brother, my brother…
[39:13] I will rip open his stomach
[39:15] and take out all your money.
