[01:41] My favorite.
[01:43] I will give you, only if there is any left.
[01:44] All of it will be left today.
[01:47] It’s his favorite, he doesn’t leave it.
[01:48] I will give you, if there is some left.
[01:50] Your poor man is not coming today.
[01:52] He is working overtime on the weekend.
[01:54] I came to tell you this.
[02:03] What will you do now?
[02:08] I will do, what I am doing.
[02:11] I will water the plants.
[02:13] There, at the office…
[02:15] There are only machines all around.
[02:18] Man is obsessed with the computer…
[02:20] Computer has overpowered the man.
[02:23] Not…not even a single plant is there at the office.
[02:29] You must have been feeling very angry towards me, right?
[02:34] Not at all.
[02:37] Doomsday is still far away.
[02:41] Ibrahim!
[02:43] Let’s go.
[02:44] Let’s go to your office.
[02:45] I will tell them that its because of me and I forced you.
[02:48] I will plead them, beg before them, come on, let’s go.
[02:52] No.
[02:55] That job is not worth so much…
[02:58] That you plead and beg before someone.
[03:03] Ibrahim, let’s go, please, I am feeling very bad.
[03:16] Aliya Madam!
[03:20] What would I have had earned from that job?
[03:24] What I had to earn…
[03:26] You have already paid me lump sum.
[03:43] May I say something?
[03:48] I also can’t live without you.
[03:51] Not even for a day…
[03:54] Not even for an hour…
[03:56] Not even for a second.
[04:01] Anita, you have guests.
[04:02] They are sitting outside in the common room.
[04:03] OK.
[04:11] Yes.
[04:14] How are you, Anita?
[04:27] You may ask for more if you need.
[04:30] Just one would have been enough for me, if I had any information about both of them.
[04:35] The rest is for both of them.
[04:38] If Aliya needed of money, why would she have been wandering with a pauper?
[04:42] Ask her to leave that man and live with her Brother.
[04:45] I also would not keep any contact with her.
[04:48] People have started talking.
[04:50] The elections are due in a few months…
[04:52] Brother’s position will worsen a lot.
[04:54] It’s the woman, who faces problem after the divorce.
[04:56] What problem does a man has?
[04:58] He will announce the divorce after the election.
[05:01] Isn’t it brother?
[05:05] For the sake of my martyr Father…tell me.
[05:08] You are saying as if she is sitting at my place.
[05:12] If it had been so, I would have had definitely helped you.
[05:21] You would…definitely help.
[05:28] You have used this option with my parents as well.
[05:31] It’s useless.
[05:33] I have other options too…
[05:36] Which you would not want to know about.
[05:38] I do have an idea, Mr. Chaudry.
[05:40] But I can’t help you any further.
[05:44] My advice to you is that you let them be on their own…
[05:48] And announce your divorce publicly.
[05:49] Otherwise, she will do this herself.
[05:52] Public…
[05:55] They have nothing to announce publicly…
[05:58] Except for humiliation.
[06:03] Now you tell me, Mr. Chaudry…
[06:06] How may more options do you have?
[06:21] Don’t you feel scared?
[06:24] You guys are enough to feel scared.
[06:26] Now this is the divorce proof.
[06:29] Now you both need a marriage certificate.
[06:32] It’s very important.
[06:36] Aunty, you ask Aliya, only then she would agree.
[06:40] Where is Aunty?
[06:44] Yes Aunty, you called for me.
[06:46] Aliya!
[06:48] These girls want to do something.
[06:50] Aliya!
[06:51] How did you and Ibrahim get married?
[06:54] I had already told about it.
[06:55] What do you mean?
[06:57] Were there no pre-wedding functions or festivities or dancing?
[07:01] No.
[07:03] But we want to do all that.
[07:06] Why are you looking at me, its Aunty’s plan.
[07:08] Bilqees: Aliya, she wants an old woman like me to be a part of it.
[07:12] I have told them that I can see my youth in Aliya.
[07:16] I came to the city exactly like this holding your Uncle’s hand.
[07:19] And created this whole set up.
[07:21] It’s Aunty and Uncle’s 30th anniversary.
[07:24] We want to have some fun but they are not ready to become the bride and the groom again.
[07:30] Everybody is putting their share…
[07:32] You both also put your share.
[07:33] Our share…How should we both participate?
[07:36] All these girls in the hostel have fallen in love with your love.
[07:41] They are only making me an excuse.
[07:45] We will celebrate your pre-wedding function only.
[07:47] Some music.
[07:48] A ritual…no, no, no, no.
[07:50] Please! Say yes, say yes, please Aliya!
[07:52] refuse to them…no, no, no.
[07:53] Refuse to them, no way.
[07:55] Please, Aliya, please, Aliya.
[08:00] I, I…Ibrahim!
[08:01] What is your problem?
[08:03] Why are you bugging Aliya Madam?
[08:04] Ooooo! Alaiya Madam!
[08:08] Its justified now.
[08:11] Yes, yes, its justified now.
[11:23] Oh, my beloved! Without you…
[11:27] My heart doesn't feel content.
[11:31] Oh, my beloved!
[11:35] There is no one, more charming than you.
[11:38] Wherever I might be…
[11:41] Don’t ask me about…
[11:45] Greetings, Ibrahim brother!
[11:47] Greetings!
[11:48] How are you?
[11:48] I am fine, Ibrahim brother.
[11:50] Ibrahim brother, had great fun last night.
[11:54] Yes.
[11:55] Everybody was happy.
[11:58] And I didn’t know that you also can dance.
[12:00] No, I can’t dance, everybody forced me, so I danced a little just like that.
[12:09] Ibrahim brother, it just struck me, someone is here to meet you.
[12:13] With me?
[12:14] Yes.
[12:15] Who is it?
[12:16] It’s some Cleric, he is standing downstairs.
[12:18] What was his name?
[12:20] Aaa…Cleric…
[12:23] Cleric, Ghulam Rasool?
[12:25] Yes.
[12:26] Cleric, Ghulam Rasool.
[12:27] He is standing downstairs.
[12:29] Down stairs?
[12:30] Yes.
[12:35] Tell him that I am coming.
[12:36] Ok, fine.
[13:00] Aliya Madam!
[13:05] Aliya Madam!
[13:39] Where is Mr. Cleric?
[13:41] Greetings!
[13:42] Greetings!
[13:43] Are you Mr. Ibrahim?
[13:44] Yes, where is Mr. Cleric?
[13:46] He is there at the end of the street.
[13:47] Then call him upstairs.
[13:49] No, no, he is sitting in the car, you come along, lets meet him, come.
[13:52] Come, boss come, he is sitting in the car, it’s not a problem.
[13:55] You should have brought him upstairs, we would have comfortably…
[13:57] The car couldn’t turn, this street is very narrow.
[14:00] Ok, ok.
[14:00] It’s no problem, you relax and come.
[14:02] When did the Cleric Sir come?
[14:04] He came 5 minutes back.
[14:05] OK.
[14:06] Yes.
[14:07] Where is he?
[14:08] Where is he?
[14:11] Police!
[14:12] Come on, sit in the car.
[14:13] You can’t do this.
[14:13] Sit in the car.
[14:14] Sit in the car.
[14:15] Let’s go, let’s go.
[14:17] Let’s go.
[14:19] Let’s go.
[14:24] Aliya Madam!
[14:26] Aliya Madam!
[14:30] Aliya Madam!
[14:31] Yes, Maula Daad.
[14:33] The police have arrested Ibrahim brother.
[15:11] They seem like the ones under cover.
[15:12] how could they be under cover?
[15:14] You must know it.
[15:15] You gave their guarantee.
[15:17] He has done it, who else could it be other than Shabbir?
[15:19] How did Shabbir reach here?
[15:21] Who Shabbir?
[15:23] The way he reached your call center, Anita.
[15:25] Tell us also, a man has been arrested from here.
[15:28] We also will be interrogated tomorrow.
[15:30] Nothing will happen to you guys.
[15:32] Why wouldn’t nothing happen to us?
[15:34] After all, he has been arrested from here.
[15:36] I have given the guarantee.
[15:37] We saw your guarantee.
[15:39] When police will raid the girl’s hostel, who will send their daughters here then?
[15:44] I had asked you not to…
[15:45] Stop it, you guys.
[15:47] A man has been arrested here and you guys are worried about your business.
[15:51] Have some fear of God, please.
[15:53] Hello Fauzi buddy, how are you?
[15:55] Buddy, there has been a problem.
[16:44] Hello Fauzi!
[16:45] Yes, yes, yes.
[16:47] Was the police mobile from there?
[16:49] Confirm?
[16:50] OK.
[16:52] Ok, fine, fine, I will let you know.
[16:54] OK.
[16:56] Its Shabbir.
[17:44] Let’s go, Cleric Sir.
[18:12] Salute to Mr. SHO.
[18:14] May you live long.
[18:16] Mr. Chaudry, don’t do this, it’s my duty.
[18:19] You are awesome, you are great!
[18:22] Cleric Sir, please come, have a seat, come.
[18:27] Sir!
[18:28] Wow! Wow!
[18:31] Where did you find this shameless from then?
[18:33] Don’t ask me Mr. Chaudry.
[18:35] I found him with great difficulty.
[18:37] You may say that we had deployed the entire city’s CID after him.
[18:41] We have dug him out of the ground.
[18:43] Wonderful! Wonderful!
[18:45] Did you find him alone?
[18:47] Oh, come on Mr. Chaudry, there won’t be a whole gang for a small charity box.
[18:51] No, no, but you yourself said that there might be some other people behind him…
[18:55] This is why I was asking.
[18:59] Let’s see.
[19:00] Let’s beat him up and then see, who he mentions.
[19:06] Mr. Cleric!
[19:07] I think, you should talk to him.
[19:12] Act strict with him.
[19:14] He might tell easily.
[19:15] It’s a matter concerning the mosque.
[19:17] Things will stay under wraps.
[19:18] Isn’t it Mr. SHO?
[19:20] What do you say Mr. SHO?
[19:25] He is a kid, Sir.
[19:29] But Mr. Butt, I want to appreciate.
[19:32] You have done a great job.
[19:34] Where did you find him from?
[19:40] Rafaqat!
[19:46] Present Mr. Chaudry’s man before him.
[19:48] Yes, Sir
[19:49] So, you were telling me about where did you find him from?
[19:53] Enjoy the fruit Mr. Chaudry…
[19:55] Why do you want to keep a score?
[19:59] He must be hiding in some mosque, isn’t it?
[20:03] Mr. Chaudry, you may say that we have…
[20:05] Arrested him illegally.
[20:08] Going beyond our limits.
[20:11] We have kidnapped him in a way.
[20:15] So, you…may say it was a mosque.
[20:18] We have mentioned the same in the report as well.
[20:23] Wonderful! Wonderful!
[20:25] May you live long.
[20:58] You go and have some tea and refreshment.
[21:01] And take a little longer.
[21:02] Good!
[21:09] Where is she?
[21:10] Where is Aliya?
[21:11] Where is Aliya?
[21:13] No, Mr. Chaudry.
[21:13] Let me talk to him.
[21:15] Let me…let me talk to him.
[21:17] Dear…
[21:20] Mr. Chaudry knows about everything.
[21:22] Whatever you did was based on your faith.
[21:25] As per her desire…
[21:27] As per her wish…
[21:28] The mistake you have made. dear…
[21:30] Come on…now fix it.
[21:33] Ibrahim dear!
[21:35] Come on.
[21:38] Dear!
[21:40] I have done nothing wrong, Mr. Cleric.
[21:44] Whatever I did, is with my own willingness.
[21:47] Dear…
[21:49] We have…
[21:52] Given our word to Mr. Chaudry.
[21:54] It’s a breach of trust.
[21:56] If the commitment goes against our faith, one can always go against it.
[22:02] His matter…is against the Islamic laws.
[22:06] I have told you so many times…
[22:07] Not to teach me Islamic rules.
[22:09] Do you get it?
[22:10] Should I talk to him or should I leave?
[22:12] Make him understand Cleric Sir, make him understand.
[22:14] I will explain it to him.
[22:16] Dear…
[22:17] Dear…
[22:18] Whatever had to be done is past now.
[22:20] Do you want to find a better solution or not?
[22:26] A better solution has been found, Cleric Sir.
[22:30] Me and Aliya…
[22:32] Hey!
[22:33] How dare you take Aliya’s name?
[22:36] She is Chaudry Shabbir’s woman and suits him only and not with a sewer worm like you.
[22:45] Whatever had to happen, dear…
[22:47] It’s done.
[22:49] Dear, you both don’t have a match.
[22:52] Why are you causing trouble for yourself for no reason?
[22:56] Me and Aliya are happy together.
[22:57] Oh, your happiness…
[23:00] What’s your happiness?
[23:02] Just two meals on request, that’s it.
[23:08] God knows, who is the poor girl begging before to feed you, you shameless!
[23:13] She has ruined herself out of sheer stubbornness.
[23:18] Dear…
[23:21] I don’t think…
[23:23] That whatever you are saying is wrong…
[23:25] But it is stupidity.
[23:28] If you don’t believe me, Cleric Sir…
[23:32] Come with me.
[23:33] Let’s go.
[23:34] Come on, Mr. Cleric, let’s go quickly.
[23:35] Let’s go quickly.
[23:39] Not you Mr. Chaudry.
[23:42] You are not permissible for her.
[23:45] Not without her permission.
[23:55] What do you think?
[23:59] That I need your divorce.
[24:04] You will rot in this dark cell all your life.
[24:09] And she will spend her entire life washing dishes...
[24:13] For this impermissible.
[24:17] Why can’t you understand, Mr. Chaudry?
[24:22] I am not scared of you today.
[24:25] I feel pity for you.
[24:29] Mr. Chaudry! Mr. Chaudry!
[24:30] Nonsense.
[24:31] Mr. Chaudry!
[24:35] Mr. Chaudry, I think your anger is adding more fuel to the situation.
[24:38] The matters which are caught up in emotions, are resolved with mutual understanding.
[24:45] Give him a chance at least.
[24:47] Let me meet that lady…
[24:49] So that I can understand the situation a little.
[24:52] Mr. Chaudry…
[24:54] I have found a way out.
[24:56] We will have to be patient to untangle it.
[25:07] So, Mr. Chaudry…
[25:09] Did you come up to some solution?
[25:12] The boy has agreed.
[25:14] It’s just collection time.
[25:17] Very good!
[25:18] It’s a good thing.
[25:20] He is a kid.
[25:22] He made a mistake.
[25:24] He will improve himself.
[25:26] Human beings do make mistakes.
[25:28] Ok, it’s absolutely correct.
[25:30] Cleric Sir…
[25:31] Is ready to take back his complaint.
[25:36] Ok?
[25:38] Let’s withdraw Cleric Sir’s complaint.
[25:40] We will do it for sure.
[25:43] We can’t return the boy at the moment.
[25:47] There is another complaint, filed against him.
[25:50] About what?
[25:52] About committing theft.
[25:55] Chaudry Zubair has also filed a complaint against him…
[25:58] That Ibrahim has stolen something from his house as well.
[26:08] You guys just have to highlight Chaudry Shabbir’s name.
[26:12] You must ensure his party somehow…
[26:15] That if Chaudry Shabbir receives the ticket…
[26:17] Victory is assured.
[26:19] Why Mr. Chaudry?
[26:21] Why should we contribute to the enemy's strength with our own efforts?
[26:24] No matter how strong a fort made of sand is…
[26:27] After all it’s made of sand.
[26:28] No, Mr. Chaudry…
[26:30] He has greatly provoked the emotions of those rowdy boys.
[26:33] Don’t consider him so weak.
[26:35] Relax!
[26:38] My cards are very strong.
[26:41] I will show, when the time comes.
[26:43] Mr. Chaudry!
[26:45] Cleric Ghulam Rasool is here to meet you.
[26:48] You guys continue, I will just be back.
[27:08] You sing very well.
[27:10] You sing very well.
[27:11] I enjoyed a lot.
[27:12] Your harmony and tune are absolutely proper.
[27:16] You were very good at giving the call to prayer.
[27:18] We used to listen to it here five times.
[27:22] If you would not have had sung this song…
[27:24] Then I would not have had been able to reach you.
[27:28] I reached your hotel through this song.
[27:30] To the call center from there…
[27:33] And to the hostel from there.
[27:38] I hope you had not left the Cleric Sir because of this song.
[27:45] Tell me.
[27:46] And…people say that the matter is something else.
[27:49] Seems like a big issue.
[27:51] You tell me…
[27:54] How big is this issue?
[28:03] Have tea at least, come on, have some tea.
[28:05] Drink it, drink it.
[28:07] The tea is getting cold.
[28:08] Hot tea soothes the throat somehow.
[28:11] Have it.
[28:22] Tell me, that…
[28:25] What is your and Chaudry Shabbir’s problem?
[28:31] Tell me.
[28:47] I did not commit theft, Sir.
[28:49] What, what?
[28:50] I did not commit theft, Sir.
[28:53] I also know that you did not commit theft.
[28:56] But you are still sitting here.
[28:59] There is surely something wrong.
[29:01] Why?
[29:05] What…what is the matter?
[29:11] Actually…
[29:14] Mr. Chaudry has become upset over something.
[29:18] Mr. Chaudry has become upset.
[29:23] About what?
[29:30] I am asking, what is Chaudry Shabbir upset about?
[29:36] God keeps a man’s faults hidden, Sir.
[29:41] Man should also…
[29:43] Keep a man’s faults hidden.
[29:48] Look!
[29:49] For the sake of this hidden secret…
[29:52] You will suffer big time.
[29:54] 7 to 8 months is the minimum.
[29:58] You are not getting my point, buddy.
[30:02] Just tell me that what is the matter between you and Chaudry Shabbir?
[30:07] That’s it.
[30:10] Then I will drop you, where you came from…
[30:13] Safe and sound…
[30:16] In one piece.
[30:23] I know it, Cleric Sir…that he is not a thief.
[30:27] Then, Mr. Chaudry…
[30:29] Why did you file a report against him?
[30:32] You also know, Cleric Sir that he is not a thief.
[30:36] Why did you file a report against him?
[30:39] Actually…
[30:43] He was lost…he had left.
[30:46] How is this going to work?
[30:49] I will consider it, only if you will tell me the truth.
[30:56] Have mercy on that innocent.
[31:00] I will pray for you all my life.
[31:03] Ah! You are right.
[31:06] Prayers are important but we don’t need prayers only.
[31:11] We need votes as well.
[31:14] My apologies, I came to meet you leaving a meeting.
[31:17] People are waiting for me.
[31:19] Bye!
[31:27] So.
[31:31] I hope you know what to do.
[31:33] You have to ensure his party that Chaudry Shabbir will get the ticket.
[31:38] Mr. Chaudry…
[31:40] Why should we make our enemy’s fort stronger?
[31:45] Who do we have in the lock up?
[31:49] Sir, Shehzad Sarwar and Mitthoo.
[31:55] Who is the most dramatic among them?
[31:58] Sir, its Sarwar.
[32:00] He screams on the top of his voice, if we touch him.
[32:02] But he doesn’t accept.
[32:05] OK.
[32:08] Do one thing…
[32:09] Beat him up in front of this boy.
[32:12] Yes, Sir.
[32:16] Ok, Sir.
[32:24] His wife is here, Sir.
[32:28] Whose?
[32:29] Ibrahim’s.
[32:33] Wife?
[32:34] She is saying the same, Sir.
[32:38] What not is coming out of this charity box.
[32:41] Send her in.
[32:51] Sir!
[33:05] Yes.
[33:07] Greetings!
[33:09] I have come to ask about Ibrahim, why have you arrested him?
[33:14] What is your relation with him?
[33:16] He is my husband.
[33:19] According to our information, he is unmarried.
[33:24] What’s his crime?
[33:26] When did you guys get married?
[33:28] It’s been 2 months and 11 days.
[33:32] Do you know Chaudry Shabbir?
[33:37] Yes, I definitely know him.
[33:41] What is his problem with Ibrahim?
[33:46] I am here to ask the same that what is his problem with Ibrahim?
[33:59] Who had asked you to go and talk to him, Cleric Sir?
[34:06] You should have held his collar.
[34:13] You have a great power…
[34:20] The power of the pulpit.
[34:23] Who said so?
[34:26] Who said that the pulpit is power?
[34:29] Pulpit is a belonging.
[34:33] I am already sunk into a guilt of a problem.
[34:36] He will destroy everything…
[34:38] He will ruin everything.
[34:42] He will destroy me.
[34:45] The door of the repentance is still open, Mr. Chaudry.
[34:48] Turn to Him.
[34:52] Don’t you care even a little about Ibrahim?
[34:57] God will protect him.
[35:03] Oh God!
[35:12] Yes, Mr. Butt.
[35:14] Ibrahim’s wife is sitting here in my police station.
[35:17] She wants to meet you.
[35:34] Bunty!
[35:37] There has been a blast.
[35:38] Aliya has reached the police station and she is saying that she is Ibrahim’s wife.
[35:42] I thought there is going to be a bomb blast.
[35:43] There has been an atomic explosion.
[35:45] You get out of this.
[35:47] He is caught in my grasp and you are telling me that…
[35:49] If you want to cut his throat then but it in the battle field.
[35:51] Not barging into his house.
[35:52] You were abusing Aliya yesterday and today…
[35:55] You may also abuse her.
[35:56] Abuse her as much as you want to…
[35:58] But in front of me only.
[35:59] Not on the street outside, at the square, or on this phone.
[36:02] Do politics Zubair…
[36:04] Don’t do cheap stunts.
[36:05] What is wrong with you?
[36:06] Take some cold water and get back to conscious.
[36:08] Aliya has really got married to Ibrahim.
[36:10] She called me…
[36:11] To ask about bubbly.
[36:23] Oh no! oh stop! Oh! Oh no! my nose got cut.
[36:28] Oh! Oh!
[36:29] For God’s sakes, don’t do this brother.
[36:31] Stop it brother.
[36:31] Oh!
[36:33] Aaa!
[36:35] Leave me!
[36:38] Aaa!
[36:39] Leave me!
[36:41] Aaa!
[37:11] You answer me please, I hope no one has harmed you.
[37:14] No.
[37:15] Shabbir…
[37:16] Did he raise his hand on you?
[37:18] He is going crazy for you.
[37:19] if he sees you, he will kidnap you.
[37:20] You should not have had come,
[37:22] The truth is that Shabbir himself has got me married to him.
[37:25] Why would he get his wife married to someone else?
[37:27] Do you think we are fools?
[37:28] For remarrying.
[37:29] Both of you leave from here silently.
[37:31] I am being that much lenient, you should consider it enough.
