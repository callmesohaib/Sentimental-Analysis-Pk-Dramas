Greetings aunt.
How are you Rani Bibi
I am good. You people doing good?
Oh no no no. Don’t you dare
stop right now,
Ugh!
Petrol had to end now?
Greetings uncle
Hello child live long
uncle
here’s 50 rupees fill up the tank
the inflation is too high
you can’t even get a pack
of chips for 50 rupees.
maybe not a pack of chips
but 50 rupees is enough
for this petrol.
you see illegal stuff can’t be
sold at legal prices
if you say we can just call
the cops and ask them
oh no child there’s no need
to call the cops
I was just kidding
oh really?
I didn’t know we had
that kind of relationship
why didn’t you tell me before
oh don’t be funny do u want me
to fill up the tank?
No just take these 50 rupees and
put some fuel in so I can get home.
Okay, okay
Oh,
look at those hot patties,
why do I never have enough money?
I am not that broke
I can get one patty.
Brother give me a patty a hot one,
how much is it.
Oh,
Mine or yours it’s all the same,
take anything it’s all free.
Oh really? The shop is mine?
Mine or yours it’s all the same
Of course.
Hey kids over here,
come here yes come come
So kids this shop is mine
for the day
and I happen to be
in a very good mood
so you guys eat all you want.
(Kids yelling)
Oh, madam don’t do this. oh,
leave it alone
He took it away;
madam, please stop them
they’re going to take it all away.
You don’t know
who you messed up well
I should go,
gotta tell you father you signed
the shop off to me.
Please madam no please forgive me
I swear on my life no I swear
on my father’s life
I will never catcall again I’ll never
even look at you again
but please don’t tell my father
Should've thought of that before
you decided to catcall me?
The future prime minister of the country.
Son, wait till I get into the office
I’ll announce capital punishment for people like you.
Madam, I have made mistake.
Hey, you!
What are you doing sitting here
didn’t I ask you to get groceries.
I called brother he straight up
refused to give me money.
Refused? Why?
Where is he?
There he is.
Listen here!
Why did you refuse him money?
First of all,
tell me one thing grandma
who made this grocery list.
I did
Grandma why so many groceries?
Seems like we are responsible
for the entire town’s supply
You got to do what you got to do,
this new area is weird people here
don’t socialize with one another.
So, in order to get with these people,
you have to be smart
now you see the general store here
we are going to buy so many groceries
that the shopkeeper will get confused
I asked Shenshah to tell
the man at the store
that all this is going the family of royals.
I wish this was really the family of royals.
It’s the same lie you people told my family
to lure me into this family
Listen to me
There was no allurement
my great-grandfather’s name
was nawab
and so was his attitude
Wow! Everyone is so obsessed
with themselves in this house
no one cares about me
Look,
my dear uncle here is so lazy
that if he gets up to do anything
he can’t keep his breath
and his laziness is the reason
why I am responsible for his whole family
And hey look at her
my aunt’s daughter Rabail!
She’s resting in peace while
I take care of her responsibilities.
I have no life!
I have worked so hard to build everything
I have but what’s the point?
This bodybuilder here eats
everything what do I do
look at him, Shenshah,
feels like he employs us and not him.
My poor dad,
he used to send so many dollars
but now he sends so little like
something in the camel’s mouth…
Rice?
No, no biryani, nothing else
Something fragrant as far as I can remember
Rose?
Cumin?
Yes cumin!
Send as many dollars
 as cumin in a camel’s mouth
Cumin in the camel’s mouth is very strange
Which reminds me of curry
cumin’s added in that too.
We can whip some curry up
that’s not a big deal.
Make some naan too
Also, curry doesn’t have cumin in it
you can look it up
on YouTube if you want
It does actually
I’ll go see my mother’s old recipes
greetings
how nice look everyone came
today everything okay?
greetings
please
I have come here with
a very important matter
my family’s name is being disrespected
because of this woman
and my son just won’t listen to me
no so Mr. Charlie can you please
shed some light on the matter
my wife has labelled my daughter in law
unfortunate for not having a son
see now that’s not good
exactly.
Auntie how do you know your son
isn’t the one who’s unfortunate
Why did you even marry her
If you couldn’t protect her?
I don’t know anything I want to
get my son married again
but this idiot is all under
his wife’s spell
what if the second wife didn’t
give him a son? then?
that logic has weight
what if the second one didn’t
give you a son too?
we’ll only find that out if he
agrees to get married again
so, it means ruining the lives
of two different women.
my son is reaching 30
and when he gets old who will take care
of all of our land and properties?
Enemies are looking for a chance
they’ll just take it all.
right
so I think
instead of trying something new
why don’t we try the old method
that’s been proven successful
see auntie’s son isn’t ready to remarry
so why don’t we get auntie’s
husband married again.
Long live Rania. Long live!
so, it’s settled
then I’ll get married again let’s go
Okay
I’ll never let that happen,
rivers of blood will
flow through the streets
let it flow but at least there’ll be
an heir to look after our legacy.
I am so grateful to you ma’am
my heart is soothed.
Let’s go father I’ll find you a beautiful bride
let’s go I’ll find the matchmaker
Mian sahab, I am telling you this granddaughter
of yours is evil.
You need to put a leash on
her she’s ruining my life.
look at her squirming. What about when
she was doing the same to her daughter in law.
Mian Sahab I am telling you really need to control her
the entire village will know everything
that woman said about her
Troublemaker and cunning
Rani I am warning you keep
your tongue in control or else…
I will kill you!
oh wait
child your mother has a fragile heart
she gets scared
but I am very proud of you
you always say the right thing.
Give some of this confidence
to your mother as well.
Sure Mian Sahab

00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:16,639
brother Kamal here’s you 5 thousand
5 thousand?
we talked about three rounds, right?
But we brought all the trucks in
one round hence it’s 5000
but you brought only three trucks
that’s because…
why are you staring
at me like a gangster
yes, I am a gangster
why are you walking around with gangsters
I thought you were a decent man.
Hey dude do you have some
extra money on you?
no
in situations like these your
own friends become strangers
Why don’t you come over on Sunday
now!
Let’s go
easy man it’s my house
mama you in the kitchen?
Means you cooked?
yes, son you care for me too much
but in this new place
I’ll have to take care of cooking
and cleaning till we find a maid
what have you made?
Eggplant curry
how will we eat this?
I don’t know
everything’s all set up
Hopefully this new area
will be good for us.
Actually, I think why don’t you invite
the ladies from the neighbourhood
and have a little kitty party for them
something nice on Sunday
and we’ll do some socializing too.
you’re always worried
about yourself
Korean recipe I assume?
For the new neighbourhood
I made eggplant curry
eggplant curry?
Our swimming pool has
less water in it than this.
what did you say?
I mean it looks very good
Laiba set the table we’ll
all eat together
oh, but I am observing a fast
for the new house
I’ll break it at sunset
fast?
I am on a diet can’t take
up too many calories
I had a big breakfast
I am not hungry at all
I did so much work for what?
What delicious food I cooked,
it’ll all go to waste now.
ugh
For god’s sake
you two are still playing?
When will you do your homework.
There’s a test tomorrow.
And you? I told you to get off
the bed two hours ago
Tell me something Hammad did you
take an oath in your childhood
that you’ll be lazy forever.
what’s wrong?
why do you have so many issues
with my content life.
because your happy life has made
mine horrible
I live like a widow and your kids
orphans even though you’re alive
that’s your issue.
You think too negatively and
it reflects in your life.
what about all that generational wealth
and riches your mother promised?
where is it?
Why are living like this looking to
your rude nephew and his American father?
After brother Dabeer left
who was going to take care of it all?
We sold half
and the rest was taken away from us
but not all of it is gone my lion of nephew
Mahir is taking good care of what’s left
and you? What’s your purpose?
You know what today I feel like going
to a five-star restaurant
and ordering a nice & expensive meal
we’ll go too, us too
how will we go?
There’s nothing in our pockets.
that is true
and to top it all off my mother called
she told me Mona’s planning on coming
how was I supposed to tell her
that we are living in this house like
second class citizens already
my poor sister doesn’t know
what she’s getting into
that is also true
I don’t know why I am even
playing flute to this buffalo.
wait
do you have money?
Are we going?
No, I was saying can you maybe
pick my phone up from there?
pick it up yourself,
bending a little won’t
fracture your spine.
what a strange woman.
useless man
hello dad, how are you.
what is this dad?
Don’t call me that
It reminds me of those
shameless American dad
Call me “Abba ji” “baba Jani”
Saying that makes you
feel very respectable.
You understand?
You little centipede
do you know when I mention my dad
in conversation with my friends
they are filled with respect
and anyway “abba” “baba” are
very local terms here.
”Dad” makes you feel imported.
You are one stubborn son.
do whatever you want
I can’t live here so far
and still use the old ways
there’s a different sense
to Pakistani fathers
Sometimes I just feel like getting on
a train and coming to Pakistan
and disciplining all the kids
the traditional way.
hey hey what are you saying?
consider we’ve sent you off
to America for good.
Your only home is in America
now stay there!
what are you even saying son?
I am right.
Do you know what I’ve told
my friends?
I told them my father is a big
American businessman
and his personality?
He doesn’t even look like my father
he looks like my brother.
And look at you dad,
you don’t even look like my dad
you like dad’s dad.
What have you done to yourself?
America did this to me,
swallowed my youth
Your luxurious life back home
came at a cost.
I have lived off of spearmint sauce
and loaves of bread
and sometimes
when the bread would go stiff
then I would dip it in water to make it
bearable I have worked so hard
while you lot are having the time
of your life over there
Do you know what happened once?
Let me tell you a story son
Dad, dad, dad,
I think I should go
and you should eat some spearmint
sauce doctors say it’s good for health.
You go rest and I’ll do the same
Talk later ok bye bye bye.
huh,
my coffee went cold
because of this idiot.
Oh no it’s still hot
Dabeer did you set
the table for dinner?
yes yes ma’am I am about to,
I was just doing the dishes.
why does he get so emotional
for no reason every time
Little does he know
how hard my life is,
the entire family’s responsibility
is on my shoulder,
and look at him,
having a blast in America.
Here I thought I’d get a new car
I even told all my friends
God knows how I’ll face them now
I saw you at the rooftop yesterday.
Since then I am thinking
whether you are prettier or…
Or the sparkling moon on the sky.
I am unable to decide.
You tell.
Why are you saying so?
He didn’t curse me.
He just asked an innocent question.
Hmm.
Men your age must be married,
with at least two to three children.
A boy can’t say these foolish
things to you.
That means I should keep an eye
over all the married men near me.
You are right, Rania.
He must be someone disloyal
and bored from his wife.
Such men should be cursed
thousand times.
Don’t worry.
Just let me come into
power just once.
I will make such a law for such lustful men.
They are not ashamed at all.
Well, reply him.
Reply to him in such a way
that teaches him a lesson.
No, no, Rania.
I will not. Leave it.
Let it go.
Hey, why won’t you?
Your niece will not stay silent.
Hey, Rania.
Are you out of your mind?
Will you defame me
in the neighbourhood?
Leave it.
Why should I leave it?
I should know who he is.
I will text him for sure.
I will not spare him.
You say such cute things, right?
You will be cute by face
as well for sure.
Show me your face, please.
You see. He will not be spared.
Did he reply?
Yes.
He is saying that I cannot glow
in front of your face, Asma.
I swear, you are unique.
I swear?
Whose catch word is this?
Got him.
I had a correct idea.
He is a lustful oldie.
I will go show these messages
to his wife tomorrow.
Then he will get to know
how unique we are.
You know him?
Tell me too. Who is he?
Tomorrow, the house that will echo
with the voices of a man screaming,
be assured that he lives
in that house.
I will also take some
battler women with me.
He will not be spared.
Is he married?
Yes.
Does he have children too?
Yes.
And not just two. He has five.
And he is flirting with
an unmarried girl like me.
Now don’t say that you will hit him
when you will become a PM.
Because such a scoundrel
should be hit right now.
He made fun of my feelings.
He made my Bebo cry, right?
I will not spare him.
Hey?
Who is she?
For God’s sake.
At least listen to me.
Shameless man.
For God’s sake. Listen to me.
Hey? Hey?
Hey, oldie.
Take this. Hit him with this.
Beat him with this. Beat him more.
To hell with you.
Shameless scoundrel.
Take this. Beat him with this too.
Take this.
Come out.
Shano, save me.
Will she save you?
She will save you?
Come out.
Hey? Hey, hey?
I swear I am not that kind of a boy.
Boy?
I have not sent any such texts to anyone.
If you don’t believe then ask my Shano.
You are being treated right.
Really?
Whose number is this?
Yes? Look at this, aunt.
Have a look. What cheap texts
he has sent to our child.
Child?
Is she a child?
Hey, will I call her a moon?
Am I blind?
Hey, if I’d have to call someone a moon,
I’d say that to my Shano.
Who even looks like a moon.
Lustful oldie,
you are being treated right.
Hit him.
Hey, hey? One minute.
One minute.
Listen to me.
I got it. It is not my mistake.
It’s my son’s mistake.
It’s… It’s…
It’s…
Hey?
You tell me.
You are sitting silent.
Tell me honestly.
I am being beaten up because of you.
You have done it, right?
You sent this sms, right?
Tell me?
Father, you have the cell phone all the time,
and now you are blaming me.
I am a child, not a fool.
Shut up. Hey?
You argue with your father?
Shano, are you watching him?
Hey, your actions are as such.
You must have sent those texts.
Beat him. Beat him more.
Hey, hey? One minute.
One minute.
Forgive me, forgive me.
I agree, it’s my mistake.
But after today,
I will never send any text to any girl.
I repent. Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Next time,
if you flirt with any other girl
apart from your wife,
then I will bring the police next time.
I will get you arrested.
Get it?
I apologize.
Make some parathas for them.
Let’s go, aunt.
Enough for today.
You people don’t know your friend.
Hey, we are rich from generations.
My father is in the US.
Where in the US?
Changa Manga.
I am talking. Keep quiet.
Dude, make less noise.
Yes, so what was I saying?
Hey, no, dude. Yes.
Where in the US?
Hey, ask me how many places
does he live at?
Hey, he is such a big businessman.
He doesn’t have just one place to stay.
Yes. Well, listen?
I have decided.
I will come to Dilawar Shah’s
wedding by myself.
And I will give him such a gift
that people will see.
Yes. Okay. Bye.
Grandmother, tell me one thing.
I have to give such a gift to a friend’s
wedding that it elevates my respect.
What should I give?
Then gift him this house.
What about us?
We will live on the trees.
Just like your husband, you have
said such a cheap thing, aunt.
Grandmother, you tell me.
Hey, just give him 10 or 15 thousand
as a wedding gift.
It will work as a showoff too.
Hey, the thing you said about the gift,
you know your father has not send us
any money this month, right?
With the house rents,
we will barely survive.
Grandmother, don’t take tension.
I am here, right?
Show me this ring.
Oho, grandmother.
What a design!
Is it gold’s?
Yes, yes. All my rings are gold’s
with diamonds on it.
Grandmother, it should weigh
at least one tola, right?
Yes, yes.
Do remind me.
When Saman’s father-in-law would come,
I will show off my rings in front of him too.
Yes, yes. Wear it now.
Hmm.
What do you mean?
Why did you put in your pocket?
Hey, grandmother.
The problem is solved.
This ring, right?
I will give this ring.
Are you not ashamed?
Yes? Are you keeping an eye
on your grandmother’s jewellery?
You, thief! Take it out.
Hey, grandmother. This ring is nothing
in front of our respect and glory.
People even give their lives
for the sake of their respect.
This is just a ring.
And I am not asking for it forever.
When I will get some money,
I will give you even heavier than this one.
You have made such promises to her
a hundred times earlier as well.
Mother?
Do you remember?
The necklace made from real stones
that I used to like a lot too…
After that, the jewellery box made
from elephant teeth…
And after that…
Well, that’s enough.
I have not kept anything.
Hey, I will return.
But not now.
When I will have money, then.
He’s right.
We have to do everything
for our respect.
Exactly.
By the way, son.
Tell me one thing.
For how long should I be hopeful
that my loss will be recovered?
Grandmother,
that I can’t tell you now.
But very soon.
Very soon.
Okay, I am going, grandmother.
Okay, okay.
Respect, and glory.
All of that is only for the grandson
and his grandmother.
We don’t have any respect.
I have not sent your husband
to make a monkey dance, right?
She just talks and nothing else.
She knows nothing else.
Lift it.
What happened?
Are you tired?
Yes?
Hey?
Stop, stop, stop.
Where?
I have stopped.
Get off, carefully.
Good.
Javed?
In the name of Allah.
Greeting, mister.
How are you, mister?
What did I tell you? I told you
that your son Abdullah,
Yes, yes.
I shouldn’t see him working here
during school timings.
Yes, actually the inflation is so high.
I also like my son to study.
It’s the inflation, don’t I know?
Send him there during the school timings,
I have even talked to the headmaster.
Mother asked me to bring tomatoes,
shall I go buy them?
I will obey your order, sir.
Sister?
Such a nice suit!
From where did you buy it?
I went to Lahore city.
I brought it from there.
It costs Rupees eight thousand.
I bought five suits like these.
Hey, all your veggies are stale.
How much for a kg potato?
Sister, they are for sixty a kg.
Sixty rupees?
I will pay only forty rupees.
Sister, fear God.
Even I don’t buy for forty rupees.
I said forty, then I will only pay forty.
One minute. One minute. Aunt?
You can buy clothes for
six to seven thousand.
But you can’t pay this poor man
the right price for his veggies?
Here you go. She is here too.
A welfare worker.
How are you related to this
that you are interfering?
I am just saying that
he is a poor man.
If he will earn from here,
he will feed his children two times.
And besides, he is coming to
our neighbourhood for so many years.
We all know that
he is such an honest man.
Why do you bother him?
Hunh!
May God bless,
may God bless.
May God keep you safe.
Your granddaughter is an angel.
Life of a cartoon is so pretty.
I envy seeing their lives.
Father, have some shame.
A child is sitting here.
What are you saying?
You are envying what…
My luck!
Greetings!
Mother is here.
Have a seat, grandmother.
Mother, shall I bring you water?
No, child.
He fed me juice on our way.
Wow. Wow. Wow.
This huge shopping?
What have you brought?
Hey, aunt.
We bought the whole mall.
Show it.
Yes, yes. Showing it.
Have some patience.
Where should I start?
Yes, I should start from a shirt.
Check this, uncle.
See this, see this,
see this.
What a print!
What a cloth!
Hey, wow!
Whose is it for?
What do you mean whose?
It’s mine.
It will look so good
when I will wear it, dude.
Uncle, look at this.
Camel colour.
And this colour is so inn these days.
Show more.
Hey, have some patience.
I am taking it out.
Where has it gone?
Here it is.
This shawl is for my pretty grandmother.
And here is the bedsheet for her bed.
I forbade him but he insisted
to buy these for me.
Hey?
How did I forget?
Here. Here it is, uncle.
See how fit this pant is.
You will see when I will wear it.
That’s for you too?
Yes.
You didn’t buy anything for us?
Aunt, so you said it like strangers, right?
Hey, what is this ‘yours and mine’?
We live in one house as a family.
Hey, whether I wear these clothes,
you wear them, or Rabail.
What difference would it make?
When I will wear it, then of course
we all will be respected, right?
Hey, what…?
Did I say anything wrong?
Hammad?
Your wife is such an envious person.
She was hurt the most for my shawl
and my stuff.
Tell him.
She knows the royal anger, right?
Look there. Look,
my granddaughter is sitting there.
She is happy, right?
She was not jealous.
Grandmother is absolutely right, uncle.
Grandmother, this world is like this.
Everyone is selfish.
Hey? No, no.
Your aunt is not selfish.
She is a bit sick.
That’s why she was angry.
She is so happy seeing all of this.
Very good.
The cartoon is nice too.
Hey?
Look at this.
Uncle, check this.
Who is coming in such a big car?
Sister? Sister has come.
Sister?
Hey, bring the sweets.
Hey, I am amazed.
This beggar Rafique bought
a new shining car?
I am jealous.
Greetings, grandmother.
Live long, live long.
Love you, love you.
My dearest is here.
Greetings, sister.
Greetings.
How are you?
Thanks to God. You say?
Wow, you have brought
a new shining car, right?
Saman?
Tell your grandmother that
we have brought sweets for her.
Here you go.
We have brought sweets made
with ghee weighing 10 kgs.
As we bought a new car.
Yes, that I can see.
But you should have hired a driver too.
Why so, grandmother?
Because you see, your personality…
It doesn’t suit you driving this car.
So on the front seat,
there should a person in the uniform
driving this car.
So this way people will know that the person
sitting behind is the owner of this car.
By the way, I came here
in such a good mood.
So I didn’t tell your family background
in front of the children either.
You wore such a nice
white suit today.
Seems like a black crow
is wearing it.
Mother, talk to me too.
I have come for you.
Greetings.
Greetings, son.
Saman, child.
Tell your grandmother
about the car.
It is such an amazing car,
honestly.
Very nice!
By the way, mother.
Without selling our old house,
we are buying a new house.
You sold your old house
and bought this bungalow.
Material invested here is not good.
I would say one should never
buy a readymade house.
Listen to me.
There was not a single labour
in our last seven generations.
How would we know whether
the material is cheap or whatever.
We forgot.
I should have called you.
Right, son Hammad?
Brother, congratulations
for the new car.
Thanks, thanks.
Thank you very much.
By the way, Hammad.
Tell me one thing.
Are you on job somewhere
or are you still high on the royalty?
Hey, listen to me.
Why does he need to do odd jobs?
His brother is sitting in the US.
He showers dollars.
He doesn’t have any load.
You will see the dinner table.
We have five dishes to eat.
And after dinner,
we will have teas of five kinds.
But today, our chef is on leave so
we just have potato meat curry for today.
Do eat it before you leave.
Potato meat curry?
Potato meat curry?
Mother, you didn’t treat
my father-in-law well.
He respects you so much.
You disrespected him.
Oho, you don’t worry, okay?
He is used to getting
ridiculed from me.
Do you what the real thing is?
His father was your
grandfather’s employees.
Your grandfather used to
have warehouses in the city.
He used to work there.
Then why didn’t you get me married
to people equal to us?
Hey, daughter.
It’s better to have son-in-law
from a lower family.
I didn’t know that
they will compete me.
Now see, to make me jealous,
he brought a new car.
Maheer, listen to me.
Next week,
Saman, Rafique,
and his son are coming.
So before they come,
bring a new car and
park it in our veranda.
Don’t act in front of me
like you are petrified.
I am jealous.
Grandmother, be mindful a bit.
We just bought this huge house.
How will he bring the car?
Did you hear what did he say
about the house?
Son of a labour!
He said that the material
used is cheap.
Yes? Maheer, son.
Do one thing.
Find an experienced worker,
call him, and show him this house.
And ask him whether
the material is right or not.
My heart is pounding.
Grandmother,
what is wrong with you?
Why are you thinking about that?
Hey, our house is superb.
Strong and beautiful.
Hey, they are jealous from us.
They are saying so out of jealousy.
They can’t digest our success.
Ignore them.
Really? Is this so?
Then prepare to make them
more jealous.
That’s it. Bring a nice car.
You tell, Saman.
Is Rafique Ahmed and
his son treating you well?
Well, well.
They are very fine with me.
Okay. Hey,
it’s time for me to pray.
I am going.
Maheer, do remember.
You need to bring the car.
I don’t know how!
It’s about grandmother’s honour now.
We will have to buy the car.
I am going to Dilawar Shah’s wedding.
I will see after coming back from there.
I will buy a little Prado or something.
Prado is big, right?
Yes, but it’s little for us, right?
How many dollars would it require?
I am telling you.
Don’t you dare go to that mechanic.
Why can’t I go?
I don’t have legs or I don’t know
how to sit in a bus?
Because you are a girl.
Girls are human too, mother.
And every mature person should
do his/her job themselves.
It’s been so many days
that mechanic has taken my bike
to fix it to his village.
Now he doesn’t even pick my call,
nor return my bike to me.
I will fix him by going
to his village.
Father, do you know?
He must be taking a ride on my bike
with his family every day.
Yes, I think his intentions are not good.
That is why he is not returning your bike.
To hell with him.
Let him come tomorrow.
I will bring my bike back myself.
Hey, hey? You will go only
when I will allow you to go.
I will break your legs.
Era has changed.
The trust we used to give our sons,
we have to give the same
to our daughters now.
Even I can go with her
but I am not because she can handle
these petty issues herself.
But what will people say?
Hey, we have made our daughters
weak just out of the fear what will people say.
They can say
whatever they want to.
Yes, she will go there herself.
I will not do this.
She will go deal with that
mechanic herself.
Yes? Right?
Yes, father.
You will see what I will do
to that mechanic.
Oh, uncle?
Don’t you feed your horse?
He is not running at all.
I swear I would have reached there
on foot earlier than this.
That’s the limit.
Those kids…
Even kids are ahead of us.
At least speed us now.
Oh, child.
You can go on foot.
I will take my horse back
to my village.
Hey, uncle?
Why do you take everything
to your heart?
I want to become the prime minister.
As soon as I become a PM,
I will gift you a CNG auto.
Just make me reach there fast, okay?
Auto? Promise?
Promise by God.
Now you will see my horse’s speed.
Let’s go.
Now we are talking.
Here I go.
Yes, how much?
Rupees 150.
They are 150.
Hey, Mukhtar?
Serve tea.
Hey, why is this shop closed?
Brother, listen? Is there a funeral
to Sheday’s house?
What are you saying?
It is not necessary to close the shop
only at a funeral.
It can be closed for
a happy moment too.
Actually, Sheda got a duty
at the Malik house.
Today is their daughter’s wedding.
He is sitting at the generator.
You already know the load shedding
schedule here.
Yes, that’s true.
I will solve this problem first
as soon as I become the PM.
Prime minister…
Well, tell me.
Where is the Malik house?
Just go straight.
You will find yourself.
Okay.
By the way, if you say,
shall I drop you at my bike?
Why?
Are you my aunt’s son?
Get lost. They just get free
if I talk to them once.
Prime minister…
Aunt?
Hey, we are about to win, wait.
Aunt? Have you seen
the Sheda mechanic?
Did you think of a mechanic
after seeing me?
I have engineers in my neighbourhood.
My standard is high
since I was young, girl.
Did you get it?
By the way,
are you from the bride’s side?
Come let’s have a dance competition.
I don’t know how to dance.
So you are afraid, right?
