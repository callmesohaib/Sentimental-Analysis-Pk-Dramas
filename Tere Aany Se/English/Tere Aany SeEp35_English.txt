Brother, Shahanshah is telling me
Rania is here.
Yes, she is here.
But she came to Farhad’s home,
and not to meet us.
So you should have invited her home,
why didn’t you call her?
Rabail, after all that she has faced,
after that how do I call her to our home?
mama is calling her, come with me,
lets get her. One second.
First let me deal with my dad’s wife.
Let me tell her that
her scheming won’t work on me.
Brother,
we will tell her later,
right now let’s please meet Rania.
Come on. Come quickly.
Come on. Man. Come on, come.
You know sister Rania,
uncle sings in his sleep at night
and he dances around while walking.
When you ask him, he says that
I am practicing to dance on my wedding.
The grooms nowadays dance on
their own wedding,
so I too am practicing the same.
I am preparing daily,
I am practicing daily.
I have a doubt in my heart,
that what if your rich father converts this
happy occasion into a sad one.
Don’t worry about him,
sing happily.
Only people
with good fate get this opportunity.
Because not everyone has happiness in their fate.
Rania!
Rabail.
How are you? I am fine, how are you?
how is everyone at home?
Everyone is fine.  Sit.
Yes, yes,
she is really worried about home.
I met her a while back,
she didn’t even bother asking me,
that you are unwell,
how are you feeling now?
Hah,
the ones who don’t care about themselves,
what should one ask them?
And since that Honey came,
he came following her.
and when mama went to call him,
he clearly refused
remove this misunderstanding from your heart.
I am still doing all this because of mama.
Grandma had told me that
I have to attend uncle and Bebo’s marriage from home.
So then,
why didn’t you come to our home?
Did you wait for me?
Mian Jee was getting upset,
he was saying he is such a fool he
didn’t even come to greet me.
When you came to our home,
we served you so much,.
You remember, right?
Yes, I remember everything.
You know
I have done something like a donkey,
I will come.
and yes,
you had to discuss something related to
business with my papa.
Have you forgotten?
Or did you change your mind?
No, no, why would I change my mind?
In fact, I am even more adamant now.
I have understood that
if I stay homeless, useless like this,
then what father would give me his daughter?
So I will come really soon.
Oh, okay.
So this is the deal.
All this is for a girl.
You got that right.
I am doing it for a girl.
Tell me, when should I come?
He is not that idle,
he is a big businessman.
Go and take advice from someone else.
Hey, hey, hey, her attitude changed since
she found a rich father.
Listen madam,
your father is not the only rich man in this city,
there are several rich people ready to
give advice at any time.
And you know Rania,
that honey is better than you.
One second,
where did the mention
of Honey come from?
What is in the heart comes on the tongue.
Let him mention Honey.
Tell me more,
what other qualities does your Honey have?
What? What do I tell you?
At least she is a million times better than you.
She understands
what the other person says,
she cares for the feelings of the other person,
you are…
Since when did you start liking these things?
Hey,
his thoughts have changed.
It feels like Honey
has been a blessing in your life.
Quiet. Quiet.
Excuse me.
You people have gathered here
to talk about my marriage.
I mean, you are not talking about my marriage
and you are talking about your family,
you go
and have this discussion in your own home.
What is going on?
Uncle, I have told you not to worry.
I am true to what I say.
When I said that this proposal will be fixed,
then it will be fixed.
Hey, how will it happen?
How will it happen?
We will think about it.
I will leave now. Rania,
mama is restless to meet you,
this is why I came to call you.
What?
Sister Rania,
you came after so long and
you are going so soon.
You still haven’t even met mama.
Wait for some time, she must be coming,
meet her and then go.
Leave it child,
now sister Rania is not the same sister Rania.
She is now the daughter of a rich father,
when will she meet anyone?
Let her go.
Laiba, I will go greet mama.
When I come back, aunty will be home too,
then I will meet her as well.
Rania, what will happen to me, then?
Uncle, right now the situation is bad,
we cannot talk about good things even
if we want to.
Your time will come, okay?
Come on Rabail. Come.
Hey, damn it. Come, we will do the dance practice.
Come on, let’s not waste time.
What was the need for to mess things up?
Now suffer. You have ruined it all.
I am suffering,
what else am I doing?
Look at him.
Leave him, listen to me.
Tell me something, how do you find Rania?
What do you mean how do I find him?
Hey she is ill-mannered,
short tempered and she has tantrums.
She doesn’t understand anyone’s feelings.
I got it. I got it.
Come on, we will dance. Hey, come on,
don’t be shy. Come on.
I don’t want to do it. Uncle, I don’t want to…
Hey, this step.
This is the step son. This. This.
Why is everyone from that
home so short tempered?
Hey, at least you come. Come here.
Oh, Honey, what have you done to yourself?
Be dressed up, do a little makeup
Aunty, I always stay like this. Simple
Okay, to hell with it.
Just follow what I tell you to do.
You?
How dare you come here?
Your father took you with a lot of pride from here.
Why have you come here, now?
I didn’t come to meet you,
and nor do I want to talk to you.
Listen,
even I am not interested in talking to you,
but right now, you are standing in my home,
so it is necessary for me to ask you.
Not at all,
this is my mama’s home,
she is the real owner of this home
and I don’t like arguing with
people who make claims for no reason
and nor do I have time.
Come on, Rabail. One minute.
How are you talking to my aunty?
Just like your aunty is talking.
You are your aunt’s sympathizer.
You take her side.
You are a drama just like your aunt.
Shut up.
Don’t get your face broken by me.
What do you think? I have come from America
so I cannot fight the local way?
I will insult you so badly that
you will have steam coming from your ears and
tears from your eyes. Understand?
I think your bad days are near.
It is time for you to pack your bags.
I understand your cunningness really well.
Mahir was not home for so long,
you didn’t even bother peeking here.
Now Mahir is here, so you came after him.
What do you think?
You will have Mahir following you
after your father’s wealth?
You will not get anything,
I wont let this happen.
Mahir will get married where he wants.
Understand?
Stop this nonsense.
What are you saying?
Hey she came to this home after so long,
how are you talking to her?
This girl is standing in my home and
misbehaving with me.
Her father got some money,
and she has forgotten to respect you and old.
Uncle, aunty is absolutely right,
this girl’s behavior is not right with aunty at all.
Honey you don’t interfere,
you don’t know anything.
Come,
you come to my room.
She has a mental issue. Rabail child,
inform Seema and Mona too,
my child has come after so long.
We will have some fun.
Come on. Come on. Come.
This girl is so shameless,
she came to this home again.
Aunty,
what is the issue you have with this girl?
Tell me something.
Oh Honey darling, you are really innocent,
you don’t know.
This girl is after Mahir.
Anyway, I have decided,
I wont let them become one.
Aunty.
Aunty, listen to me. Honey,
you want to know what issue aunty
and Rania have?
I will tell you child all that
aunty has done with Rania.
Where are you?
Yes, yes, I am standing outside,
you please come quickly.
Fine. Okay, come quickly.
Are you going home?
Yes, the driver is on his way.
Rania, I am really embarrassed.
Whatever aunty did with you
was extremely wrong.
Whatever she did was her own doing,
now because of that I cannot stay away
from such loving relations, just,
that’s why I came today.
You did good
because the ones who hide at home are guilty
and don’t you worry,
I have made aunty understand.
She will not misbehave from now onwards.
Are you going back? So soon?
Yes, I had to go back.
And not soon, I am going after a lot of hours.
The driver must be on his way.
What is the need for a driver?
This bike is here, I will drop you.
No. There is no need for that.
The driver must be coming.
Obviously,
now when will you like my bike.
It is not that,
it wont seem reasonable going
with you like this.
You don’t have this thought going
with Wasiq.
Don’t say something wrong.
I have never sat with Dr. Wasiq on a bike.
He doesn’t even have a bike.
So what do you have a problem with?
My bike or me?
Both.
I understand well.
Your style and actions are changing,
I am noticing it.
Yes, you are right.
what is in the heart is evident from
the eyes and face.
end I understand everything.
But you too remember one thing,
those selfish in relations are always left alone.
When have I been selfish, Rania?
My car is here.
Goodbye.
She has left.
Now you too come back
and tell me what the deal is.
There is no deal.
There is something.
She is just the daughter of a rich father,
it is just this.
Mahir.
Mahir, listen…
Didn’t you take too long to come.
Yes,
I went after a long time,
so everyone gathered,
I didn’t know how time passed.
if they could they wouldn’t have let me come,
still.
Then you should have stayed there today.
I mean, that…
you used to live there earlier too.
It was different earlier,
now I have a home in this same city.
That’s it
or do you want to ask anything more?
No, I was just asking you. Give me way.
Oh, they are here. Those people are here.
They are not here yet, don’t scream so much.
Take care of her.  Yes.
Mama, you get off. You get off.
I am opening the door.
Such a high car, oh God.
Thank you brother. Thank you.
Come on. Come on. How are you?
Thank God. Come on. Hey,
you are in a hurry to go in.
Me? Hurry?
Hey, I didn’t want to come.
I came only cause of you people.
If you want, we will go back. Hey no,
you have come here,
now if you leave it will look like stupidity
and you don’t seem this stupid to me.
Come now. Come on.
Oh.  Hey…
Are you fine?
Yes. Are you okay?
The reason for me to come here is complete.
What do you mean?
I don’t understand.
Meaning, we might have brought another proposal to this home
or is it just what I think.
mama, greetings.
Live long. Live long, my love.
She too is here. Huh? How is my child?
How are you? Thank God. Thank God.
Now I have come here today
with the proposal of the most decent man in this city.
Yes. Today it feels like you are the boy’s family.
I swear.
You look good.
Yes, think that I am from the boy’s side.
And I will see how you
say no to your elder sister.
Sister, you brought a decent man,
but our girl is such that you wont find another one, she is such.
Listen, one is enough for me,
why would I look for another one?
Okay, thank God for that too. Wow. Wow.
such a great environment.
Love is all around.
Do you want to fix the proposal standing here?
I mean don’t you want to come inside?
Do you have time?
The people in the city don’t have time.
We got free time for you.
come on. Come. Come. Come.
Come on. Come on. Come. Come.
Thank God. Come on.
By the way,
I feel that really soon just like uncle Ayaz,
I too have to come to this home.
There is a big difference
between you and uncle Ayaz.
What if this happens that
your father says to me
take my daughter’s proposal and
let me thank you.
Today you are our guest,
so you can be as stupid as you want.
We wont say anything,
or else we know how to shut you up.
I am the elder son,
it was right for me to go with mama,
but because of your actions,
I am unable to face anyone.
Dabeer,
what will you do showing the world this face?
Seeing this face of yours the world can be sad,
they can be worried,
but they can never be happy.
Will you please shut up?
I don’t know what must be going on there?
What must be going on? Huh?
What must be going on? Everyone must be eating
or the proposal must be getting fixed, that’s it.
Dabeer,
I have noted something.
Since you have come to Pakistan,
you have stopped enjoying my company.
Listen,
do you have an affair
with someone coming here?
It is useless to talk to you.
Yes, then don’t talk to me,
you only listen to me.
By the way, I am thinking that
now we should fix Honey
and Mahir’s proposal.
What do you say?
Are you in your senses?
Mahir and Honey’s proposal?
There is no fault in my mind.
What does Honey lack?
She is American. She is American.
She is American.
She is. She is. When am I saying she isn’t?
Hey, the fault is not in Honey,
it is in you, you are her aunt.
No one will accept
this matchless relation in our family.
And Mahir?
He will not agree at all.
What if he leaves the home and goes again.
Mad woman!
Dabeer,
I am not saying this for my own benefit,
it has your benefit and your family’s benefit.
Look, if Honey and Mahir get married,
then Mahir will come to America with you,
he will work in the store with you.
Whatever we own will be theirs and
whatever is theirs will be ours.
I am not half minded like you that
I sit at home all day and make up stories.
They must be having fun there
and I am sitting here
with this sister of Sheikh Chili and hearing stories.
Did Sheikh Chili have a sister?
There was.
Her husband choked her to death.
Hey, nothing will happen,
why are you scared? Calm down.
I am not scared.  My papa is really good.
Greetings.
Absolutely fine Absolutely fine
Greetings.
Live long. Live long. Zaman, live long.
I apologize you people had to wait.
I got an important call
so I was busy on the phone.
Aunt, are you fine?
Thank God. He is great.
Rania child, what use is this juice?
Get snacks and breakfast served.
Yes, I will just get it served.
Child, we will have breakfast and also have tea.
If you ask us, we will also have food.
But the question we have come with to you,
you just answer it with a yes.
Zaman son,
we have seen the boy,
we have done our verification too,
now you just answer.
Yes, son.
His eyes, ears and teeth everything is fine,
thank God.
So do you do a job or your own business?
Yes, job. Job. I do a job.
and if you don’t mind,
can I ask you how much is your salary?
If you are okay telling me.
Brother, I think that if husband and
wife have good understanding then
if you lack money it doesn’t matter.
Even I. I think the same thing.
Yes, yes uncle,
I agree with this.
Now see,
money is something nor worth trusting,
today I have it tomorrow someone else will have it.
There is no news till now.
I feel uncle Zaman is taking a tough interview.
If he says no, then?
Hey even I am worried. If the boy is like Ayaz,
then anyone can say no.
Hey, what nonsense are you
people talking about?
the news I am going to give you after that
your hearts will stop beating,
so hold on to your heart.
Oh God, they said no?
I had said they would say no.
Oh God. What will happen now?
I feel that before my marriage
uncle Ayaz will return to God.
Oh, I am not talking about him
Then who are you talking about?
Say it clearly,
don’t create suspense like your sister.
Brother Dabeer and sister in law Sweetie
have together fixed
Honey’s marriage with Mahir.
What?
Yes
Hey madam,
why are you taking out the sweets?
Has the proposal been finalized.
It hasn’t been fixed yet,
but it will surely get fixed.
Rania.
Hey, Rania.
Come quickly.
Go control your dad,
he is asking weird questions.
He is asking about the salary,
now in a while,
he will start asking about the property.
Are these questions to ask from a boy’s family.
I am worried about myself.
Come on, man. Come. Come quickly.
Oh God, this papa is too much.
Listen, you prepare the tea.
In fact, first go put these
sweets on the dining table. Okay?
Fine, I will just do it.
I will go check on papa.
You didn’t answer my question…Ayaz.
Yes, sir, sir,
actually my salary is fifty thousand rupees.
Since the dollar rate has increased,
they are waiting for it to come down,
so the salary will also increase.
I will have an increment
and also a promotion.
Sir, they have also promised a car,
by the way the head of the company is sister.
That’s why. Yes, yes, yes,
the company has given us a home,
it is a really big home.
And me and brother,
together the two of us are running the home,
and we don’t lack anything.
Believe me,
Asma will not have any complaints.
I think all the questions are done,
lets have sweets.
Yes. I will just get sweets. Child, wait.
These are matters of elders,
children shouldn’t interfere.
After all this marriage is a serious matter.
Anyway,
you are our respectable guests
and one daughter of our is coming
to your home as your daughter in law,
so we have a relation.
So please not just tea,
eat something and go.
Yes, brother,
then what hope should we have?
You don’t make such decisions so easily.
I will think and
let you know in a few days.
Mona, listen to me.
This is not the time for useless jokes. Go.
Go inside and do your work.
The two of us are in a lot of tension
and waiting for an important phone call,
don’t disturb us.
Come on. Come on.
Go. Go and call Khaver,
he will hear this nonsense from you and he wont even mind.
Oh, hey I have spoken to him
and I am really not joking.
I have heard with
my own beautiful ears brother Dabeer
and sister in law Sweetie talking,
they are really serious.
You don’t believe me, right?
You don’t believe me either?
Come with me.
Come with me and ask them yourself.
Mian Jee.
Mian Jee.
Yes?
Papa is not treating my uncle Ayaz well.
He is so disappointed.
If he gets a heart attack out of tension,
then we will be responsible for his death
and you are the girl’s father Mian Jee,
so use your right.
Zaman, son,
you can take as much time as you want.
But remember the decision must be in our favour.
I will not hear no for an answer.
Yes. Yes. Yes. I was going to say this.
Yes, yes, this will be really good.
The guests are smiling,
this means they are going to put the sweets
and they were just waiting for me.
Greetings. Greetings.
Do you see?
Your dad has made everyone sad.
He is really cruel.
Leave my dad
and focus on your character,
that would be better.
Listen,
if you can focus a little on my character,
wont it be a little better?
I don’t care what is good for you
and what not.
Think about it, if I stop caring for you,
you will regret it.
I have not been fooled by anyone earlier,
nor will I be fooled by anyone now. Okay?
Go and sit down.
Your neck is stiff cause of pride,
your neck too will get stiff,
go and sit.
Why did you come?
I feel he is standing in your respect.
Go and sit
or else he will be left hanging like this.
Listen,
till your brother doesn’t stay yes,
we wont give up.
We will keep on visiting.
Don’t worry.
Oh my…Oh I am dead.
Such a big conspiracy.
I don’t believe this, this Sweetie thinks
she will take over our Mahir.
Never. I am telling you,
I wont let this happen.
That’s it you let it be.
You cannot control brother.
Have you seen sister in law Sweetie,
whatever she wants,
whatever she puts her hand on, she gets it.
Yes, you are right but not now.
Understand? Now she wont be successful.
Now I wont do anything. I will go straight to mama and
reveal this dangerous conspiracy in front of her.
Then mama will do everything.
You know your sister
has a hard time keeping secrets.
Could you not have kept quiet?
What was the need to tell her?
You have started a new story.
Did you people notice another thing?
Mahir and Honey,
both are going around together.
I think the setting is final between them.
You are right, even I have noted it.
She is always stuck like a chewing gum,
she is always doing this,
she is going around him.
And even at the time of the proposal
she reached with us to Rania’s.
I feel something is fishy.
They have set a trap to catch Mahir.
I don’t like this Honey.
I don’t like her at all. I am telling you,
if these two get married
I will have to participate cause of you,
but I wont give any envelope or gift,
I have told you already.
Hey, you people don’t worry,
don’t worry at all. When the time comes,
I will tell mama everything to mama myself.
Promise. No.
Oh God. You have given your word.
Mama,
Asma is not answering the phone.
I feel something is fishy.
What if Asma has gone against her brother’s decision
and brother snatched her phone out of anger.
What if,
her brother has her behind a wall
or locked her in a room
and in anger he has said that
if you step out of the home to meet Ayaz,
then I will break your legs.
Hey, why is this damned brother
of his acting like a wall between us? Why?
Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Ayaz,
what are you thinking?
Sister I feel that I will die single.
Hey I came to the world,
so that I attend the reception of people?
What else did I say apart from this?
Ayaz,
the same nonsense again.
I am really angry. Be quiet. Be quiet.
Sister, my expiry date is passing,
and you are asking me to be quiet…Be patient.
I be patient? The fruit of patience is sweet.
You said the same things to your husband,
hey that innocent man went mad.
He went mad. he came home well,
he went mad and got admitted in the mental asylum.
I meet the doctor every month,
the doctor tells me to take him, he is not mad.
I meet brother,
he says that your sister is mad,
get out of here.
You will drive me mad.
You want that I go to the mental asylum.
When will you come and meet me? Quiet.
Quiet. This is my personal matter.
This is not personal. It is not personal.
The whole family knows.
You fed a good man, potatoes and curry,
and not even curry it has water in it.
You fed it to him,
and drove him mad, sister.
You are getting young yourself,
getting injections and you have made that
man a psycho.
Ayaz, too much. Too much.
Sister,
make a call. Who knows,
maybe he really blocked my phone.
Don’t touch my phone. Don’t touch my phone.
I will hit you in the head with the phone.
This is what you did with brother.
You burned him with an iron. An iron!
Uncle, Zaman had breakfast early and went.
and Bebo is not here yet. Is she fine?
She says she doesn’t feel like it.
Huh? Call her.
Leave it, Mian Jee.
Right now whatever you
say will not have an impact on her.
Happiness came in her life
after so many years, but…
Uncle,
you make Mr. Zaman understand,
Ayaz is a good boy, he should agree.
That’s the deal, huh?
Tell me something Mian Jee,
our Mian Jee who preaches love and
satisfaction for so many years,
how did he forget what he preached.
He said no to such a good proposal
due to lack of salary.
Hey, that’s not the thing, child.
The thing is that Zaman
has come home after so long,
so he wants to do something for his sister,
so I didn’t want to interfere,
but now I feel I will have to interfere.
That’s what I am saying to you.
People listen to you in the village,
then how will your own son not listen to you?
That’s it,
when papa comes you have to tell him that
you have taken the authority
back in your hands.
Earlier you had a right to decide,
and even now you have the right to decide.
That’s it,
now I have made my full and
final decision that I will fix this proposal.
Mian Jee.
Mian Jee, you are great. I will go tell Bebo.
Bebo fix your mood.
Don’t bother me,
my mood is not fine, Rania
I have come with an explosive news,
then don’t say you didn’t find out.
I have convinced Mian Jee for uncle Ayaz and
I also made him promise that he will convince papa too.
Really? Congratulations. Really?
Do you believe me or not?
Ayaz is calling.
You know he has been calling for so long,
but I am not answering it.
Give it to me. Swear to me that you
won’t tell him anything right now.
I will go home and tell him myself.
I can bother him a little. Right? Rania!
Uncle? Ayaz.
Ayaz. Oh God,
this poor thing disappointed heart
couldn’t tolerate such a big news.
Oh God what will happen now?
I will call the ambulance. Ambulance.
Not ambulance, you get the patient
water on such an occasion, sister.
Thank God, maybe he is alive.
Not maybe. He is alive.
He is alive.
He is alive.
He is alive. Uncle was alive yesterday,
uncle is alive today.
Are you joking?
I would come from so far for such a bad joke?
I have convinced Mian Jee and
I have also told him to tell papa that the proposal is final.
Rania,
you have lit a lamp of happiness in
my brother’s dark life.
I have to do really big things,
this was something ordinary. But yes,
uncle is responsible to keep this lamp lit.
Hey I will do everything but I don’t understand
how to express this happy occasion?
How do I express it? I will sing,
I will dance, I will do it, I will party.
One, two, three go.
One second,
I will go give the good news to the neighbours.
Poor mama was so worried,
she should also know that
I can solve every issue, right?
Yes. Yes. You go,
we will party again.
