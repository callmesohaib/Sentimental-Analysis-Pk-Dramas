Oh, I swear Mian Jee,
I really wanted to meet you.
Without seeing you
I had considered me my Mian Jee.
Do you have any objection?
No child, what is there to object?
You consider me your Mian Jee,
I consider you my daughter.
Oh. Thank you Mian Jee.
I don’t know
if Mahir is eating diet food or not.
Rania, child, what did you get cooked?
Rice and lentils, curry of organic
chicken without oil and spices.
Without oil and spices?
This sounds like the menu
of Dr. Wasiq’s hospital.
Mian Jee is absolutely fine.
Sorry, I don’t know what I was thinking.
What is the deal?
Is there some worry? is all fine?
Yes. no.
Huh? Yes and no.
Both things. I don’t understand.
Are you fine, child?
Mama had to come, she still hasn’t come.
All my focus is over there.
in fact, I will call her and ask.
I don’t know if she reached or not.
She should make sure she scolds him as soon as
she reaches and she shouldn’t listen to anyone.
She needs to be strict.
Hey, Rania, what are you saying?
Why will she pull our ears?
I don’t know what is wrong with me?
I think I have gone mad in
the happiness of you people coming here.
We think the same way.
I think that is it.
I don’t believe it, did this really happen?
You said something like this about a girl.
You know, may God not even
give an enemy a friend like you.
Mahir, I ruined your image in
front of another girl. Sorry.
I will deal with you later.
My health…
grandma.
Mahir.
Grandma, you. Greetings.
Greetings. Greetings. Oh my son.
Greetings, grandma.
Greetings.
I will teach you a lesson today.
You didn’t even bother to
tell us that the child is unwell.
Mahir, Rania told us that you are unwell.
What?
Rania told you people?
Leave all this, and now come home.
Come on. Come home.
Honey, this is Mahir’s grandmother and
that is his uncle and this is Honey, my cousin.
She has come from America.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings. Live long. Live long.
Grandma, you ask Mahir,
how much she has cared for him.
Really?
I don’t have the words to thank you.
There is nothing like that.
Salik brings her over, bring her to our home.
Sure. Sure.
Come on, lets go home.
That’s it. It is enough.
No grandma,
I don’t want to go to anywhere.
Hey,
good children don’t argue.
Right now, come home.
When you get well, you can make another
reason and leave home. Come on.
No.
Till the time aunt Sweetie
is in that home, I wont go.
You people don’t worry at all.
We will take care of Mahir really well.
Yes. I know that but
what do I do about my heart.
Till the time he is not in front of my eyes,
I don’t find peace.
Look at him, see,
my lion has such a small face like a bird.
So I cannot leave him in this illness, and go.
Come on, Mahir , take out your things,
I will not leave you here in this illness.
Come on, come on.
Mahir, you drink the soup,
we will talk about the rest with it.
I don’t want to drink anything.
Please. Please.
Hamad, you take out his things.
Lets go then. We are getting late.
Then we also have to go over to Rania’s home.
What?
Rania’s home?
Why?
I won’t go to Rania’s home.
Hear that, that poor child
agreed to keep you at her home,
she will care for you and you are saying no.
You surprise me. I swear.
Rania is ready to care for me?
Thank you, child.
Okay.
Mian Jee,
I have made Farhad my brother,
he is really interested in meeting you.
Is this the same Farhad
whose proposal got fixed with Rabail?
Yes. Yes.
They are really good people, Mian Jee.
And his uncle, uncle Ayaz,
he too is a good man. You meet him too.
Our daughter Rania is praising him,
I am sure they will be good people.
What else?
By the way, Mian Jee,
I have heard you do a lot
of social work in the village.
Child, you people call it
social work in the city,
we think that it is the responsibility
of one person to help another.
Wow. Wow.
Mian Jee you said something amazing.
You are a great man and
you also have great thinking.
By the way,
Dr. Wasiq really serves humanity.
He has the pain for humanity inside him.
And don’t think that he is single
because he failed in love.
Actually, he never got time to
think about himself
or else he is a good, decent,
friendly and caring doctor.
Right? Right? Right?
Yes, sure.
When I asked him to go and check Mahir
cause he is unwell, he made a hundred excuses.
Hey, Mahir is unwell?
Yes, Mian Jee.
Oh, so you people are telling me right now.
Actually, it is my own fault,
I should have met him as soon as I came over.
He is a good child.
I only for him with my heart.
He has really cared.
He is a really good boy, I swear.
Hmmm.
Okay come on, eat.
What happened? What happened?
Hello.
Why are you messaging me again
and again like a young boy?
No, no, I was just calling to confirm if you people
reached Rania’s home or not. I am worried.
Yes, we have reached safely, don’t worry.
and Rania has started her
mission as soon as we got here.
She is busy praising you.
No, no, Rania is a really good girl,
thank her from me.
Actually, I wanted to ask
who can ask tougher questions?
Mian Jee or brother?
Actually, I have been in the bad habit
to getting papers leaked that
if I find out right now, life will be easy.
So who will ask tougher questions?
No. No.
Nothing like this will happen this time.
You will have to come fully prepared.
And you can expect strict
behavior from brother Zaman.
Huh? What if brother says no.
The palace of my dreams
will fall to the ground
and what if I get killed under
the load of that palace.
Do something. Do something.
Oh, what are you saying?
earlier I was not getting married
and now finally I am getting married with difficulty
and you plan on making me a widow.,
Hello. Yes Rabail,
did mama go to Mahir or not?
Okay, thank God.
Now she should bring him or else…
Here talk to Ayaz.
Okay, I will talk to you later.
I don’t want to talk to anyone.
You know that Mahir…
Hey, leave that Mahir.
You talk to Ayaz, he is really worried.
He is worried cause of brother Zaman
that he might mess things up.
Here. Here. Here.
Hello. Yes uncle.
What happened? Why are you worried?
I am here, I will take care of everything.
After all, my papa has changed now.
Still Rania, the heart is worried.
There is tension.
Hey, what is wrong?
Nothing will happen, I am telling you.
You just prepare to bring a proposal here.
Still I have doubts that are bothering me.
My heart is sinking. What do I do?
Then I have an advice for you.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Tell me.
You don’t bother coming here,
sit at home and all the worries,
tensions and doubts will be
removed at home themselves.
Leave it. You let it be.
If you, yourself have been
through such a situation,
then you would know
what the heart goes through.
How difficult it is to see your
love going away from you.
Hello.
Yes, Ayaz,
no, no,
why are you so worried?
Nothing will happen.
That is the problem.
I am going through such a situation
and the one I am restless for,
he doesn’t care about me even a little.
This is my madness,
I had some other dreams,
then why do I start thinking about
Mahir even when I don’t want to.
If he finds out what is in my heart,
he will celebrate his victory.
He will make a lot of fun of me.
Greetings mama.
Greetings child.
Child, live long. Live long.
Greetings uncle.
Greetings. Greetings.
You did good that you went.
I was sure he wouldn’t ignore what you say.
By the way, where is he?
Who? Who are you talking about?
Mahir. Did he not come?
Child, he is really stubborn.
I insisted a lot but he didn’t agree.
Then you should have
slapped him twice, mama.
What is this? He is unwell
and at a friend’s place.
What would Salik’s family be thinking that no one
cares about him, there is no one to care for him?
No, child, there is nothing like that.
See Salik is childhood friend,
he loves him a lot, along with that
his family is also caring for him a lot.
and that new guest that
has come to their home,
that girl is really caring for him,
like she knows him for a life time.
Greetings. Hello.
Greetings. Greetings.
Greetings.
You too are here. Very good. Very good.
The place must be really lively. How are you?
I am just like before.
But, I don’t think Rania is fine.
Right, Rania?
And where is Mahir?
Why did he not come?
Come on, brother Anwaar is waiting. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Rania, tell me,
why did Mahir not come?
What do you mean why would he come?
He is at his friend’s home,
his friend’s cousin has come over.
She was going around him is
he mad that he will come?
Oh God, thank you.
I don’t believe it, Salik.
Rania called grandma,
she showed so much concern about my illness.
Rania told grandma herself to
send Mahir to my home,
I will take care of him.
So don’t believe it.
You have driven me mad saying
the same thing again and again. Please.
Hey man,
I am in a good mood, don’t spoil it.
First let me enjoy this.
By the way Salik,
I think,
that if Rania cares for me so much,
then why doesn’t she show it on my face?
Right now she is observing you.
She is seeing if you are really
worth her love or not.
Hmmm…I am thinking the same.
Rania must think that someone smart,
dashing, rich and someone with
so many qualities like Mahir,
am I worthy of him or not.
This arrogance of yours
will get you killed one day.
Your step mother did the right thing with you.
Hey, hello, I am going to teach
a lesson to my step mother, you will see.
I have to become a really
big businessman on my own.
You wait and watch.
When I go in front of her becoming
a successful man, it will be fun.
Mahir.
Oh man.
It is time for your fruits.
This extra sweet bubble gum cousin of yours,
she has driven me mad.
She is after me. I am leaving, you handle her.
Okay. Okay.
What on earth are you doing here?
You should be in the room.
But anyway,
it is time for your fruits, sit down.
You bothered for no reason,
what was the need for this?
I want that you get fine soon,
so that we enjoy together.
See the courage of my innocent cousin.
She is planning on enjoying with
this bloody boring man. Idiot.
You know you are a little boring.
Actually, I didn’t understand
your behavior with your family.
First that girl came, she was so cute,
you didn’t give her any importance.
Then your grandma came,
you didn’t listen to her at all.
What is the matter with you?
This entire issue is because of that cute girl.
I don’t get it.
Hey, no, no, there is nothing
to understand in what he says.
He is speaking nonsense.
Just ignore him.
Yes. Yes. and you dive in
the depth of what he says, in fact memorize it.
Salik, calm down.
Calm down, don’t fly so high.
I feel I will have to complain
about you to Ifrah.
Oh, I remembered Ifrah,
how is she?
When are you making me meet her?
and you, are you engaged?
No. No. No. No.
He doesn’t get engaged,
he only keeps hopes.
That are broken often.
You be quiet.
You come inside with me,
I will tell you more detail about him.
Hey, you are leaving me here.
Okay, this..this fruit.
Come on. Come on.
Should I not feed him this fruit?
No. No. Come quickly.  Quick.
Okay, one bite.
I am coming. I am coming.
I should have gone with grandma.
Yes. Yes.
This shirt will look good on me.
See this, with flowers.
Nonsense.
If you wear this shirt and go in front of Mian Jee,
you know what he will think?
The boy belongs to
a family of entertainers.
He will clearly say no
to giving you his daughter.
Really?
Yes uncle, brother is right.
This doesn’t look good at all.
Really? One minute. One minute.
This one looks decent.
It looks decent on me, right? Sober.
What is wrong with you?
Your fashion sense is so old.
If you wear this shirt and go,
then everyone will say no to the proposal.
Tell me about this one little one. This one.
Tell me about this. It is brand new. I just got it.
Wow. Wow.
Ayaz.
Yes? Yes, sister?
What have you done to the room?
I am showing off my shopping.
Uncle was preparing to show off his shopping.
Do people prepare to show
off their shopping like this?
Then how do they do it, sister?
Ayaz those people wont select you
seeing your shirt, print and stitching.
If you have to work hard on something,
work on your personality.
Yes, sister.
Yes,
mama this is what I was explaining to him,
but he didn’t understand.
Huh? When did this happen brother?
Mama, brother was not helping him,
he was confusing him.
Be quiet. I mean,
I was going to explain it…
Okay be quiet.
Ayaz pick up all these clothes
and hang them back.
Yes, sister.
and listen to me carefully.
Yes.
If you fail in this interview,
you will see the worst in me.
Sister,
who wants to fail?
I wish.
I wish someone tells me what
the questions will be in the interview.
What is the boy’s age?
Three years older than the nephew.
What does the boy do?
Useless just like his nephew.
Stop this nonsense.
Ayaz, you fix your personality.
Yes, sister.
From today, right now, start practicing.
Absolutely, I will start it right now.
and the profile picture of yours on Insta.
I put it up today.
Hey, remove it.
But why?
you look like an elderly young man.
Huh? Really?
This is the limit.
Who will make these people understand?
Sister.
Don’t worry, you need to
enhance your personality.
How do I do that?
I will teach you how to walk.
I walk? Okay,
how will I walk when I enter the home.
Hey you are so stiff while walking.
What do I do?
Hey, you have to marry the girl,
you don’t have to kidnap her.
Yes.
With love with patience, decent walk.
Decent, okay.
Hey you are walking like a tired hen.
With love, decent boy.
Come on, get out. Get out.
Come on, child, go out. go out. Out! Out!
He will teach me. he will teach his uncle.
Hey, I….
practice.
Uncle, back.
Hey, I am going to say something
to brother Anwaar and Zaman.
That we are bringing a really good proposal
for Asma and I wont take no for an answer.
Brother,
why are you sitting here with such a long face?
Did you commit a big crime?
Hey, no brother Hammad. Actually,
I have seen that often boys from decent families
react like this, in such situation. I have seen this.
Boy.
Have you seen how decent boys behave.
Hey, nowadays, where do you
get such decent boys from?
Asma is really lucky.
But mama, when are we taking the proposal?
We should have a new suit,
we should go with preparation.
What preparation do you have to make?
You always think about ways to spend money.
I plan for going to Umrah right after marriage.
Oh hello everyone,
why is everyone sitting together over here?
We are thinking of ways to drag you out.
My dear mama,
you don’t have to put in so much effort.
I have already decided that
I will spend my life with you.
I have to give a good news to all of you.
God be kind.
My niece Honey is coming from America.
All of you will be really happy to meet her.
Hey, how much happiness
will we face like this?
I am getting her bedroom set,
so I am really busy.
Sorry Anila, I cannot give you time.
She doesn’t need your time anyway, okay?
Go do your work.
Okay dear mama.
Seema, call Mahir,
and tell him that aunt Sweetie is calling him quickly,
he should come immediately.
Then he will surely come.
Well if he doesn’t come,
then I will go pick him myself.
Very good,
so that means that he will not even be
able to breath peacefully there either.
You are so funny.
Call him. Call him. Call Mahir.
Voice call, Mahir.
Wow.
Yes?
Yes, it is me.
Greetings. Greetings.
Listen, you come here immediately.
It is something important, you come here.
Whatever you are dressed in, come in it.
I am in an emergency, that’s it.
Come on, right now. Here, cut it.
The discussion of my proposal
is stuck in the middle brother.
Brother such an important
matter is being discussed here,
you are bringing your proposal in the middle.
This is a one way traffic right now,
you please wait right now.
Hey,
why are you packing your bags?
I should have gone.
His grandma called,
there has been an emergency, he has to leave.
Okay this is good.
I wanted to introduce you two to
my uncle and aunty, they are the sweetest.
And Mahir if you want any help in future,
if you want something done, do tell me.
I will be willing to help you.
Thank you so much Honey,
you are really sweet.
You too are really sweet.
I will call uncle and aunty.
Uncle, aunty, come in. Come.
What are you doing? Keep your shirt straight.
Uncle, aunty, this is my cousin Salik.
Greetings uncle.
Hello son, how are you?
And this is Salik’s friend, this poor thing…
You? Mahir. What are you doing here?
Dad.
You know Mahir?
Yes, he is our son.
Dabeer, did you not tell Honey?
Honey never asked.
Honey, how do you know him?
This means you are Mahir’s step mom?
Yes.
Mama Seema was telling me,
Saman called, they are asking for
the wedding date. What do you say?
I say that our issues are not resolved
and they are asking for the wedding date.
I am telling you clearly,
till the time my son doesn’t come back,
till my Mahir doesn’t come back,
I don’t give permission for any marriage.
Mama, this is something that won’t happen,
you know how stubborn he is.
So he won’t come and then
the wedding won’t take place ever.
Say something nice for a change.
The idiom is correct that if you look beautiful,
then you say good things too.
Grandma.
Grandma. Greetings. Greetings uncle.
How are you grandma? I have come.
Oh my prince, live long, live long.
I knew you would come. Are you fine my love?
Grandma you called me
suddenly is everything fine?
This girl, child, you come on.
Come on. Have a seat.
Consider it your own home. Come. Come.
Hello.
This is Honey,
my niece, but just like my daughter.
My life, my princess.
Is she your daughter, Sweetie?
The one from America?
Yes.
Then what was she doing at Salik’s home?
Salik is her uncle’s son.
She said she first wants to meet her uncle,
then she will come stay here.
Coincidentally she met Mahir there,
the two of them became friends.
And now they have become best friends.
Back then I didn’t know that
Honey is aunt Sweetie’s adopted daughter.
Mahir, let the past be, let it go.
I am happy that you two have come home.
A new twist in the story.
So much spice.
I will go call Mona, why is she missing it.
Grandma, you tell me,
you called me suddenly I got scared.
Is everything fine?
Everything is fine, I will tell you later.
Right now you go and rest in your room.
Come on, go.
I too want to rest.
You people show me my room.
Hey, what is the need to rest right now?
You are acting like you have walked
all the way from America to here.
Sit next to mama, talk to her,
take her prayers.
God knows if you will get
the chance again or not.
Yes, what else?
Mama has to curse her, right mama?
I cannot face anyone.
I am really embarrassed.
Be quiet.
Yes, Rania.
How are you?
You called after so long.
Yes, tell me, did Mahir come home?
I called Salik to find out how he is,
so he said…
Yes, yes, he has come back home
and you know who he came back with?
Sweetie aunt’s adopted daughter
who is her niece, he came back with her.
Huh?
Where did Mahir find this little witch.
This is the fun thing,
she is brother Salik’s uncle’s daughter.
And she was living in their home
and brother Mahir and
she has really good understanding.
It is so funny, he has a fight with mama
and he is friends with the daughter.
I feel that there will be a really dangerous
environment at home for a few days.
So that Honey,
she is aunt Sweetie’s daughter.
That’s why!
That’s why I didn’t like her at the first look.
My heart bore witness that
this girl is really cunning and sharp.
Really?
That’s how you felt?
But when did you meet her?
Leave that.
Rabail, you have to save Mahir
from that Honey. Understand?
Me?
How can I protect him and if brother Mahir likes
that girl, then I cannot change his opinion.
So then you are useless, Rabail.
Rania listen to me. Hello?
How do I save brother Mahir?
Hey Honey, this is good that you became friends
with Mahir as soon as you came to Pakistan.
I am so happy. I am so happy. Oh God.
and you have no idea how embarrassed I am.
How will I face Mahir now?
You are mad,
what is there to be embarrassed in this?
What have you not done with him?
Do you have any idea?
Oh that’s the thing.
You don’t worry.
You go and give him the good news that
I have given up the idea of taking his entire property.
How can you take his property?
Don’t challenge Sweetie,
she can get everything done.
Right now, go and give him the good news
that I have given up on the idea.
Go, he will get happy.
I am not going anywhere,
nor will I become part of any politics.
What is going on, Mona? Huh?
This Sweetie’s daughter and
she is Mahir’s friend, what is going on?
Hey, what would we know?
We are plain and simple people.
How will we understand
the politics of these foreigners?
No, you are wrong.
Along with foreigners,
I feel internal people are also involved.
I am telling you, this Mahir is really sharp,
he is going to make a big move.
I have always said he is really smart.
Hey, so he can be, what can we do?
he can be anything.
Khaver is really plain and simple,
you talk a little loudly he gets scared.
He says he will always be my slave.
Hey he cannot control,
if he gets the date,
he will come tomorrow with his family.
I hope mama calls him soon.
We will call them. We will call them.
We will call everyone.
Now not one but two marriages
will take place in this home.
Sister in law, who is the second marriage for?
Who is marrying whom?
This is an open surprise.
The boy is at home and so is the girl.
It will be so much fun that
the whole world will see.
Oh, I am dead.
Mona, I feel all hell going to break
loose in this home, a big earthquake.
I will go an inform Hammad that
he should stop it if possible.
Yes, mama on one side
and Sweetie on the other.
Oh, God knows what will happen.
Hammad.
Hey there is nothing like that.
Hammad listen to me.
I will tell you, listen to me.
Listen. What if my wedding is left
because of these people.
No. Khaver. Love.
Whatever aunt Sweetie did with you,
I am embarrassed and I apologize.
I promise you that I will not let
anything wrong happen with you in future.
Thank you Honey.
Brother.
Brother, what are you doing?
What game are you playing,
will you tell me too?
Game.
What game Rabail?
You are marrying the adopted
daughter of your cunning stepmother?
What is wrong with you?
Save yourself. You will get ruined.
Both those mother and daughter will…
Drive you mad?
Is this what you want to say?
Yes, I want to say that.
And if I say I am not like aunt Sweetie?
Will you believe me?
Okay then I will prove it to you
that I am not like aunt Sweetie.
And I will support Mahir completely.
.
I promise.
Thank you Honey,
but I don’t want anyone’s help or support.
I will fight my own battle, I will win it.
Farhad!
You call me your sister,
but so much happened,
all hell broke loose,
and you didn’t even bother informing me.
All hell broke loose?
No hell broke loose,
we are living hell, madam.
By the way you are no less than a storm?
What happened? Why are you so angry?
That…cunning girl,
she is uncle Dabeer’s adopted daughter.
Cunning…cunning girl? What cunning girl?
Why do you taunt someone with wrong names?
Oh my God.
She has taken over your thoughts too?
She is a really cunning girl.
She is really smart.
By the way, tell me,
what is your issue with her?
I have no personal issue with her,
I am worried for mama.
This mother and daughter
want to ruin the customs of the home.
You tell me, your uptight neighbours,
what is their opinion about her?
I have heard they have become good friends.
By the way, I don’t understand, why do you
men become so stupid in these moments?
These women like Honey and aunty Sweetie
will sell you and you wont even know.
You will see, you will see,
Mahir will be treated badly, I am telling you.
Really?
When did you get the power
to see the unforeseen?
Look, I have been trying to make her
understand that she is an innocent girl,
don’t curse her, but she doesn’t agree.
I feel she dislikes Honey a lot.
and I feel you have a special
attachment with Honey.
You know, she is pretty. Ask Mahir.
Yes, do you men ever find a girl to be bad?
You know, listen to me,
us men don’t like smart girls and
we find the ones with big dreams the worst.
I swear. These stupid girls are really cute.
Right, Mahir?
Yes, but Rania is not cute at all.
No.
I am not stupid either.
and boys don’t even like smart girls,
so are you not smart either?
I will break your head.
Okay man, why are you getting angry?
Anger doesn’t suit you.
You look like a small squirrel when angry.
Yes, you are right. this was true.
Yes, today you seem really happy.
I feel you got a big happiness.
Oh, I wish I could get it.
Right now there are no chances for a long time.
And the damned person,
from whom I will get happiness
cannot take a hint.
It is really disappointing,
you should have at least cared for mama.
Remember, relations are
more important than wealth.
I have understood this well Rania,
but sadly I understood it late.
I am not joking, I am serious.
Even I am serious.
