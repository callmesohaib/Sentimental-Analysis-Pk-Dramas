Her Mother-in-law treats her like a maid
at least the maids get paid for their work
I don’t get that either
But I have always told her to be patient
Your sun will someday rise
But Mian Sahab it’s gone way too far,
this time her mother-in-law threw her 
out of the house over nothing
And her husband just stood 
there watching
oh,
that’s not good
Please talk to them
I am a widow, who do I plead to?
Please ask them to take her back
Mian Sahab, I don’t think we should coax
 and cajole such barbaric people.
You wouldn't understand the cruel ways 
of society, you are only a kid.
Rani, go to the kitchen
and help Bebo prepare dinner.
These people need me 
more than Bebo does.
Sister, listen to me.
Your brother must have sisters.
I mean, you must have sisters-in-law.
yes, I do,
she’s married and well-pampered 
by my husband and Mother-in-law
They'd freak out 
if she was pierced by a thorn,
but they don't mind if I'm crushed 
beneath mountains of problems.
there you go aunt
You just ask our permission
and go cry your heart out at 
her husband’s sister’s in-laws’ house
about the hell those people 
put your daughter through
They'll get a taste of their own medicine.
When their own daughter is humiliated
by her in-laws for her mother's treatment 
of your daughter
Mian Sahab, please stop her
she’s adding fuel to the fire.
Mian Sahab I think your granddaughter
 is absolutely right!
Why didn’t you think 
of this before?
let’s go mother, 
to Tamanna’s house
I am going to cry a river 
about their injustice to me
Yes exactly, spice it up 
and exaggerate
I’ll do just that
Thank you, Mian Sahab!
listen be reasonable there’s 
no need to go feral
Absolutely, keep your cool 
and have fun with it.
There is no reason 
to become enraged.
Sitting around moping 
doesn't always work;
sometimes you have to take a stand.
Alright, I will keep you updated 
on everything.
Gooday Mian Sahab!
Let’s go
goodbye!
No wait, don’t do that.
Come over here
What did you just do?
Mother it’s not like I did something wrong
Listen here, you little “Savior 
of the Oppressed."
Why did you have to put ideas 
into their heads
They were here to ask 
Mian Sahab’s opinion;
why did you have to intervene
It's my responsibility to help those 
who have been wronged.
Now, aren't you 
the princess of the people?
I'm telling you, Mian Sahab,
you need to send her to Lahore.
Call your sister and send her there.
She has to enroll in a university,
or else her shenanigans will taint 
your name across the village.
Tell me, why did you have to stick your nose 
into someone else’s business?
Lahore?
Yes, ma’am Lahore!
Only then you’ll get your act together
when you have to study all the time without 
the comfort of a home away from all this drama
Only then you’ll get some sense,
Send her away. Mian Sahab. Call your 
sister and send her away!
Oh,
so you’ll go to Lahore,
study,
and eventually become 
the prime minister
Who can say no to you Mian Sahab
You can send me wherever you want
listen to me
This is your own house;
we are all here for you
but now you are going to someone 
else’s house and you have to be careful
Your mother is scared of you
and all the stunts and pranks that you pull.
She’s afraid of your bravery.
She wants you to be a 
non-threatening person
Do you think you can be 
that person?
No?
All right, then talk to your sister.
Yes, I will do that.
Lahore, get ready; 
I am coming!
Yay!
yes!
look, this will go straight in.
"Uncle, get up; it’s your turn.
uncle, what are you doing?
Man, did it go in?
yes!
“Uncle’s planning on breaking 
all records of laziness anyway.
hello everyone, listen to this
and keep it in your mind
that I have spent my whole life trying 
to build name for this family
Which is why all my relatives not 
only respect but also trust as well
Take my cousin, 
Anwar ahmed for example;
his granddaughter is coming from 
Khushhaal Pur to lahore for her studies,
and Anwar contacted me to wish his 
desire to have her stay at our house
while she’s here I don’t want her to go 
through any troubles here at all
coming from Khushhal Pur 
to Lahore for studies?
Tell her to stay where she is
Education cannot change 
these small town people
you shouldn’t say that,
actually, these small town people are
more passionate and driven
listen to me.
You two can argue later, 
let me finish what I was saying first
This girl is like my own granddaughter
and well-pampered by Anwar
Now that my father has 
sadly passed away,
I want to rebuild my relationship 
with my brother.
Oh, so now we have to coddle a guest 
who wasn’t even invited?
What's your issue?
Are we feeding her through your money?
but Mother-in-law that wasn’t my intention
I understand all your intentions
Rabail Let me tell you,
she is around your age,
so take care of her, okay?
Treat her like a friend,
I don’t want you all fighting her thinking 
she’s just some simple girl;
Yes, I understand; 
don’t you worry.
I also have some good news.
what?
My sister, Mona, is coming to stay.
OH, thank God!
As if one wasn’t enough.
the house will be so quiet without her.
exactly!
I was ranting in frustration,
but Mian Sahab took it seriously.
And look at this girl, so excited 
and happy.
I always intended to pursue 
my education in a big city.
Don’t worry I’ll come back as soon as
 my studies are finished, I won’t stay there
Is everything ready?
I will take you there myself
Why would you go?
I am not a child and Lahore is right
 around the corner
It'll only take twenty minutes 
on the bus,
and I have a phone as well;
 if there's any problem,
I'll call you right away.
And didn't you have to appear 
in court with Uncle Manzoor?
Getting his land back is far more 
important than dropping me off.
Hey, listen.
I have memorized Mother’s address as well 
I’ll be fine don’t worry
That's fine, but listen to me,
and please act like a normal person 
when you're there.
Mian Sahab, are you listening to her?
I am right,
just don’t say anything stupid 
and give me a hug
Don’t be absurd; eat on time, 
and don’t start any drama.
mother, please take care of my bike
you take care as well.
Mian Sahab.
Bye Bebo
keep an eye out for someone 
handsome
I am going to study.
Woman, I am saying for myself.
Okay Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Dilawar’s wedding will 
forever be remembered
You are absolutely right
we really enjoyed ourselves,
 didn't we?
The food was amazing, 
and so was the dancing,
except for this foot fracture.
And you kept me for a few extra days,
and now my grandma in Lahore 
is upset with me because of you.
Grandma will be fine once 
she sees your face
and Real men don't care 
about these little injuries
Yes, you are correct;
now get me back to Lahore 
as soon as possible.
Are you sure this piece of junk 
will get to Lahore?
Brother, this isn’t a car, 
it's a jet."
We'll be in Lahore in no time, 
so relax.
Well, then speed up;
woah, what happened?
What happened, sir?
I think the bus broke down
Try again; it might work.
Did you have to die on me now?
ugh!
I had to reach Lahore.
Ma'am, please exit the bus.
Quickly! Quickly!
what happened? 
Where is everyone going?
ma’am didn't you hear? 
The bus broke down.
what?
there’s a workshop right 
around the corner,
let’s take the car there
Man, are you of your mind?
Look at my leg, it’s injured. 
How will I push this car?
And I don’t have time; 
I have to get to Lahore.
you said this bus will fly us to Lahore
in a few minutes like an airplane
Ma'am, be reasonable;
do planes not malfunction?
Get off the bus and 
get another one
I'll have to take the bus now;
give me my bag.
And You!
you should add some money and 
trade this piece of junk for bicycle,
that’ll be more reliable than this
I have never been on a bus 
my whole life,
and now I have to 
because of you.
How far is it?
just a few steps.
Take care of yourself
yeah yeah
and call us when you get there
okay
Tell me something, can't you people 
examine the vehicle before hitting the road?
You have wasted so much time 
and ruined my journey
God knows when
 I'll get to Lahore.
ma’am I’d be very grateful if you could 
please continue this speech in the other bus
There are other passengers behind you
too please exit the bus
Quickly!
Ma’am please be quick.
Ma’am please be quick.
I am being quick.
Son, how are your mother 
and father?
yes, uncle they’re doing better now
May God have mercy.
I think maybe you’re in the mood
to get torn to pieces
Man,
the heart’s not going anywhere,
and who would object 
if you were the one breaking it?
uncle! Uncle!
This man is a thief,
he pickpocketed you
He’s a thief
hey you!
You son of a …
Get him!
She's lying. 
She’s lying! That’s my purse
do you know why these people 
are beating that poor man up?
Excuse me?
You!
you!
Man, what are you doing here?
Yes, me, so what?
You are following me.
What?
Man, are you insane? Why on earth 
would I be following you?
psycho!
you look well-educated but 
your frivolous ways contradict that
It seems as though you have 
forgotten your loss that day.
hey easy, you winning over me?
You won that day 
because you cheated.
Oh, really? “The winner cheated” 
that’s what the losers always say
(The bus is here, let’s go)
don’t mess with me
back off! Over there
why should I back off? 
Why don’t you take a step back?
you back off.
Don't try to mess with me, idiot.
step away.
don’t raise your finger at me
Oh, really? 
I’ll do just that
take your finger out of my face!
I won’t take my finger down
I’ll shove my thumb in your face then
Here you go
I’ll miss the bus because of you
Hey, stop the bus
 wait!
Stop! Stop!
calm your horses,
the bus is filled with passengers
and there’s only one seat left
Now you decide which one of you 
will get it
So, put my luggage on the bus, 
and what are you doing staring at me?
And why is that? Hey conductor,
whatever your bus fare is,
I’ll pay you double of that 
because that seat is mine.
It works for me.
get in.
there’s no issue 
because we are together
together? What? 
yes, together.
No, she’s not with me; she’s lying!
put this in.
Hurry up, it’s getting so late,
we have to get to Lahore
Sister, could you scoot 
over a little?
(let’s go)
I also have to go to 
Lahore on this bus.
Actually NO, that woman,
no I don’t want to go on that bus
I’d rather walk.
Finally, okay, make room.
how?
Do you see any space here?
There’s no space here; move along.
You are such a selfish person
that even though you can see
 that my leg is hurt,
you still won't give me some room.
Have you no shame?
Can’t the rest of the passengers 
see that your leg is injured?
If they don’t care, why should I?
you are such a double-faced person
I paid twice as much for this seat;
remember you said that we'd adjust,
so now adjust.
I already did; this is my bag;
here’s me with my phone,
and everything’s chill.
Are you just going to stand here 
the whole time?
Go stand over there.
Move along.
You’ll pay for this,
Cursed with an injured man’s maledictions
it’s very hot in here, 
Thank God
What is this? Huh?
What is this? Two purses?
You ignorant man!
You see a girl alone and you think 
you can get free with her?
Have you no shame?
Don’t you know how to stand?
Are you out of your mind?
I have no interest 
in falling over you
I wasn’t the idiot 
who pushed the breaks,
and if you’re that bothered, 
go sit on the roof.
why don’t you go sit on the roof?
And oh, driver can’t you drive properly?
or are you driving for the first time?
Man, the bandits are here!
the bus is already at capacity
and now we have to make room 
for the bandits too
They’re not here for seats; 
they’re here to rob us, you idiot.
what?
To rob us? Now what?
Sit down now!
Man, they're here! 
They are here!
making noise won’t 
do you any good,
don’t try to act smart 
or else I will shoot you
Everyone take your stuff 
and get off the bus
(inaudible)
Don’t you worry brother Anwar; 
I’ll call you the minute she gets here
no, I am not worried I was just calling 
to ask if she has arrived yet or not.
It’s just that my grandson isn’t home
and neither is Hammad
otherwise they would’ve picked her up 
from the bus station.
She does everything on her own here
but I did give her 
your contact number
So, if there’s any issue, 
she will call you
You did well,
so I'll ask her to call you
as soon as she arrives.
alright!
oh, Dear God I had so many dreams,
I wanted to something for my country
Oh God, grant me a long life, 
Ameen!
Stay quiet!
It’s all happening because of you
and how you treated me so unjustly
everyone, take out all your valuables 
and place them here
I don’t have anything of value on me,
I was worrying for no reason
You worry about you 
and your expensive watch.
Now you’ll know.
Stay quiet!
It’s just that my leg is injured;
otherwise, I would've taken 
these bandits down in a snap.
Oh, please,
it’s not like you got shot,
you are just trying to be a hero.
hey lady it seems like you 
have some unique problems
You're making so much noise, 
take it all out
We don’t have all day 
we are busy people
but brother I don’t have anything
I am very poor even my Ticket was 
bought by this great man,
he's a rich guy from the city and 
he even has a touchscreen phone
Give it to me, quickly!
do it.
okay okay, I am handing it over
Here you go.
Hey, you clever girl, you too,
hand it over or you’ll regret it.
How will I alert Mian Sahab now?
for the love of God be quiet
your wails are going to get you killed 
and buried around here somewhere
Quiet!
Hey you Robber, you’re acting 
so brave with that gun in your hands
Give them to me and 
we’ll see who’s braver.
Hands up!
I am here alone and 
you all are clapping
Come here and take the guns!
get them!
beat them up, 
and him too.
police is on their way, 
you will rot in jail now
please forgive us.
oh, now you want forgiveness?
please forgive us
I got sucked into this mess 
because of you
One second, take this;
don’t let these people go 
till the police arrive.
keep them tied up.
This is your punishment, 
rot in hell.
(inaudible)
It’s true what they say,
there is nothing else like Lahore.
Hey, if the journey has been good, 
one should leave after saying farewell.
I guess whatever floats your boat
where are the taximen? 
Taxi?
Taxi?
brother there is a strike going 
on these taxis are not operating
dude
What's the situation? Is there a strike
 every day in your city?
no, actually, every taxi driver 
in the city went on strike
when they learned that a great personality
like you was visiting the city.
I think there’s someone 
inside that car
Hello brother, good morning; 
wake up
Will I go to Model town?
There’s a strike.
yes, I am aware 
but I’ll pay you more
how much?
you tell me
It should be around five hundred.
I’ll take a thousand
Okay, thousand it is, 
start the car.
Come on, let's go to model town.
What are you doing?
I am the one who negotiated the fare 
and I am the one who will be going
Get out, now!
So, what if you negotiated
 the fare first?
It seems as though you have never 
used local transport
Whoever sits first,
gets the seat.
You made the same mistake
 in bus as well
Brother, start the car.
What the hell, man? I just agreed 
on a fare with you,
and I am willing to pay you twice as much,
and you are willing to leave without me?
brother my taxi is very spacious,
over 6 people can travel 
in it you can sit as well
Are you insane?
I am not going to travel alone 
with a strange man.
strange man?
There is no way 
you are leaving without me
Let’s see if you can go without me.
Leave it! 
Move aside madam.
Okay brother! Let’s go.
(thinking)
I wonder what kind of a man he is,
who knows maybe he’s pretending
to be a passenger
but is actually involved in the business
of abducting beautiful girls
brother take a right from here
no brother, take a left, 
I have to go left
left? Why? No, Take a right from here
oh hero, if you want turn right so bad
then get out and take another one because 
this taxi isn’t going in that direction
Take a left brother.
Did you eat crows for breakfast today?
You just keep fighting with me
Do you have zero manners?
that’s just how to talk to strangers,
if you have an issue then get out!
Oh, really? So, you can take up
 the whole taxi?
Never.
Stay in this lane and stop 
if there’s a medical store nearby.
Okay brother.
Let's go brother, 
start the taxi now!
ma’am but sir hasn’t returned
sir?
That man even looks shady
and we were attacked by robbers 
right after he got in the bus
I never trusted him;
I think he went to bring his partner 
so he can snatch your taxi from you
Leave him here and go! 
Throw away his luggage and drive.
Ma'am, are you serious?
I swear, throw away his things, 
and let’s go.
Go, go, go.
Pull over there. 
Yes, here is the location.
Thank God, 
I have finally arrived.
How much do I owe you?
you, ma’am, owe me 
fifteen hundred rupees
1500?
Why the shock, ma’am? 
You said you will pay more
Hmm, I did say that.
Do you even have money?
What do you mean I don't?
How dare you? 
Do I look broke to you?
When I become the prime minister,
you’ll be the first one behind bars
You’re one to talk.
give me my money so I can go
a little patience won’t kill you
Here’s your 1500, 
now go!
hello!
Hello?
oh hello,
you must be a guest here
and you must be the host,
Bebo did say that a 
really smart guy lives there.
oh really? 
Your bebo said that?
yes
it sounds like your Bebo can spot 
a diamond in the mud.
yes, she can
So, shall we go inside the house?
whose house?
your house, mine is really far away 
and you were obviously waiting for me
I had no idea that 
I was waiting for you,
I mean, I didn’t know that 
you were coming over
Did Ammaji not tell you?
No
One second, Ammaji?
 Who’s Ammaji?
Where does she live?
 who?
At your house, where else?
my house? No, she doesn't
Did you kick her out?
what?
one second, who are you? 
What’s your name?
My name is Farhad.
Frahad?
What's this “cheap motorcycle guy” 
doing out here?
cheap motorcycle?
Ammaji’s guest
Yes, Ammaji, and uncle...
uncle Hammad, he lives here too
Yes, they live here.
oh, okay okay so you’re
the neighbours’ guest
Shall I go then?
Who's even stopping you?
Why are you getting mad?
If you are a guest of our neighbours,
then we consider you ours as well.
I am available to assist you
 at any time.
okay you can go now
Sister, give the bags to me; 
that’s for me to do.
okay take this too.
What a nice antique bag.
What's for lunch?
I am starving.
it’s a surprise
I'm not sure where that girl 
got stuck.
Hammad had to go out too
otherwise he would’ve picked her up 
from the bus stop.
Hey, call your husband and
ask when he will get home?
okay Ammaji
Your guest is here!
Greetings, Greetings!
Thank God
I was waiting for you all day
Yeah, I am here, 
but don't ask how I got here.
It’s a long story, 
I’ll explain later
okay okay come in.
Greetings!
this is Seema, 
your uncle’s wife
Mrs. actually.
Come sit, you must be exhausted
Shenshah go get something 
refreshing for her
Greetings!
This is my granddaughter, Saman.
And this is Rania,
my cousin’s granddaughter,
and this is her younger sister, Rabail.
Greetings!
Grandma I think we’re going 
to hit off really well
Sure.
and myself, Shenshah Khan, 
must’ve heard the name
(inaudible) No, no, not him.
Ammaji, the girl is very innocent
 and sweet,
I really like her
Just like my Mahir;
he has taken the responsibility of this house 
from a very young age.
(Thinking) here we go again 
with Mahir’s praises,
it’s almost as if she doesn’t even 
see anyone else
That picture over there, 
is his.
Him?
Greetings!
Greetings to you too.
My son’s finally back
Greetings! 
How are you, Rabail?
Greetings Grandma, 
how are you?
You really worried me, where have you been
Grandma, don’t ask what happened
Who’s that?
That's Rania, my cousin’s granddaughter
 that I told you about.
yes, I remember
that’s her
Oh, look at her getting all shy,
my grandson is very innocent 
and sweet.
Greetings!
you?
Her?
Yes, that’s her, Rania.
Greetings!
She’s being polite, 
Answer her,
I heard her
hey don’t act unreasonable,
I have been singing your praises,
don’t show your real face
Did she tell you the tales 
of her innocence?
she doesn’t have to;
it’s written all over her face.
written where? 
I don’t see it.
Ammaji, I just remembered 
where I have seen him before
He was in the same bus as I was, 
he didn't even have seat
I took a look at his injury and 
gave him some space on my seat.
His days aren’t going so well
because you know 
what happened?
Bandits broke into our bus 
and attacked it!
They beat him up so bad 
I had to jump in to save him
If it weren't up to me, he wouldn’t 
be standing here today.
what.
What is this girl saying?
You said you’re getting 
VIP treatment there, serving you
But they sent you back on a bus?
Who does that? 
I told you not to go,
but you never listen to me.
grandma listen to me 
without interrupting,
you don’t know her at all
She’s super cunning.
don’t you dare get angry at her
Oh, Grandma, she’s lying!
Everything she’s saying is a lie
why? Didn't the bandits tell you to be
quiet and sit tight or they'd kill you?
no such thing happened,
in fact because of all her noise 
the bandits’ attention shifted towards me.
You don’t know her, she’s a coward
Girls are mostly fearful and
 innocent, understand?
it’s over now, whatever happened 
is in the past,
we have to live in the same house now,
we should live with peace and harmony
I swear I'll never even mention how much 
the bandits insulted you,
and I just remembered
 the full story.
He's very brave himself, 
you know he beat them all up...
Brother Mahir
What's that witch doing here?
I came over to stay here
No, I'm referring to 
that evil witch Rania;
why is she here?
What are you talking about? 
She's super cute.
She’s Grandma’s cousin’s 
granddaughter,
heard she’s pretty smart and 
is here for higher education.
Don’t say something stupid 
in front of her, okay?
I don't understand
 Grandma’s obsession
with making all her relatives 
live in this house.
What's the matter?
 Are you guys fighting?
Do you know her?
Why would I be fighting with her?
Even my rivalry has a high level.
I don’t know her.
anyway, forget it let’s go sit 
with everyone outside
I am in no mood at all,
I am very tired and my foot hurts
I totally forgot to ask, 
how was the wedding?
First class!
Your brother was hit there
People were praising me 
more than the groom.
I knew you would have great time
Can you get me some tea, please?
I am on it.
"Something needs to be done 
about Rania.
oh, uncle you came to bring me 
back so early
I told you I’d stay a few more days, 
then I’ll come back
actually, child the thing is, that house 
feels empty without you
And that husband of yours just wanders 
around the house like a lost pigeon
I can’t see him like that
there was no need for all this fruit
 you’ve brought,
do you think we don’t buy 
our own fruit?
of course, you do,
but the thing is that this fruit 
is the best of quality
and everyone deserves 
that once in a while
this is Saman’s Brother and 
Father-in-law, come greet them.
Greetings! Greetings! So, 
they are Saman’s in-laws
But you said they’re pretty well-off
yes, we are,
I just bought 4 acres of land
and we have very big house in the city
and we have our own business as well
Tell them Khawar or 
do I have to tell them everything?
yes, he’s absolutely right.
if you are so well-off
why didn't it ever occur to you 
to name some land after her?
yeah, so that…
Dad, Ammaji is absolutely right;
we should transfer some property 
to my Sister-In-Law’s name.
wow, you have such revolutionary ideas.
Daughter-in-law’s share 
in father-in-law’s assets,
wow you’ve made me fan.
Thank you!
who are you child? 
I didnt recognize you
She's the granddaughter of my cousin, 
Anwar Ahmed Siddique.
God bless you! So, tell more.
What type of business 
does your father run?
my father has sadly passed away
but my grandpa is the headmaster 
of our village Khushhaal Pur’s school,
he’s retired now and 
about our assets,
that I don’t know; we must have 
some but I never asked
she's being modest because her 
"some property" is greater than
the sum of your and 
your father's assets.
Do you remember when you used
 to live in a house of only 12 yards,
or have you forgotten those times?
Is that so father?
we should really get going’
you are not going anywhere; no guest leaves 
our house without having eaten something
and I am also remembering
A lot of childhood stories I’d like 
to entertain the kids with while we eat.
What was I saying?
you were talking about
 his cage-sized house
yes!
well then Saman, kid I think 
we really should go now,
we’ll eat some other time 
Let’s go
show off!
You don’t know 
what Azra Jahan is capable of,
I am not impressed 
by the likes of him
He brought fruit!
Fruit of the best quality, 
that’s the state of him.
you know Ammaji, 
you are my Ideal from now on.
be a little careful 
they're my in-laws
It’s for you that 
I don’t let his head too high
I keep him under my toes
because if you get a little too friendly 
with people like him
They forget their limits
yes!
And you won’t find 
these lessons in books
What Amma means is that
you shouldn’t give too much power 
to those lesser than you
Ammaji , I think I will learn 
a lot from you
