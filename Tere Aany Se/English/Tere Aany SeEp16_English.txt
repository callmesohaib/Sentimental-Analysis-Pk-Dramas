I always wished my sister-in-law
to be humorous,
and what a joke you've made, slippers.
I admire your sense of humor.
Hey brother-in-law, why are you quiet?
You can also chip in, I won't mind.
Wow,
today you changed your skin
just like a snake.
We used to think you don't even
have a tongue in that mouth.
Earlier you were my brother's in-laws,
now that you're my in-laws as well,
I feel like a family.
You know,
my confidence level increased.
Rania, tell him why we are here.
What?
Say no to this relationship.
What are you saying?
See, I'm not liking your jokes anymore.
And we are not liking this relationship.
We can't marry off Rabail to some lizard.
See, grandmother chose me herself
for her granddaughter.
Grandmother was wrong.
And none of us can accept this.
Say no to this.
Excuse me.
Yes?
See, my father isn't home,
nor my brother or sister-in-law.
If they were here, they would have
gotten offended.
Because respected people don't back off
once they establish a relationship.
Respected my.
It's a compulsion.
They are compelled to.
Do we not know how stupid and illogical
traditions, respected families have?
And they sacrifice their
whole lives after it.
Who could understand it
better than you?
Mahir, tell him.
Yes, she's right.
What's right?
For God's sake Khawar.
I called you my brother,
consider that at least.
Aren't you my sweet brother?
How happy I was to see you
both here.
Little did I know,
you're here to kill my dreams.
Okay, even if I say no,
do you know what my father
would do to me?
And grandmother? God forbid.
I'm sorry I won't even be able
to bear her reactions.
Listen to me,
main character of national geographic.
If you won't be able
to bear her reactions?
Then get ready to bear my reactions.
Leave him.
Mahir.
Leave me.
Leave him.
Let go.
Let go.
Hey, Khawar,
you only have a few days,
think about it.
We'll visit again soon, and next time,
it won't be so pleasant,
hope you understand.
Think about it.
Let's go Mahir.
Let's go.
You used to seem very brave,
that's how easily
you're giving up?
I'm not giving up,
I'll go again,
I'll go again and again,
till he agrees.
Just keep doing as I say.
This is how bad my time is,
I have to play according
to her plans.
I'm so stressed,
don't want to go home.
Can we go on a long drive? We'll feel
better in a fresh environment.
She's in her own games,
wants to spend more time with me.
She's falling for me.
You've won my heart
by supporting Rabail.
I don't know how I included you
in my plan.
Idea.
Why don't you get married
instead of Rabail?
Grandmother's attention will be
diverted to you.
And Rabail will be spared.
That's an amazing idea,
why didn't I think of it earlier?
I'd need a girl to get married,
do you have someone
in your mind?
Yes, I do.
Now she’ll take her name.
Clever girl
If it's like this,
then tell me her name.
No, no, no, don't be shy.
If you've started the conversation
then complete it.
Say her name.
The one and only, Mona.
You can marry Mona,
Mona is such a nice girl.
And do you know,
she likes you too.
You will be really happy
for the rest of your life.
Wedding.
Girls have a weird psyche.
If they love someone, they get mad
at him and they ignore him.
She talks a lot,
it’s all so strange.
The weather outside is really nice,
such a refreshing breeze.
Let's go to the lawn?
I'll even make tea for you.
Okay,
you want me to come
to lawn with you?
Yes,
let's go?
Now even your friends are
getting married.
And Salik and Ifrah are
so happy together.
Randomly, I was thinking
don't give your family
the similar happiness as well?
Mona, you can marry Mona,
she likes you too.
You will be really happy
for the rest of your life.
Wedding.
Hot and delicious coffee
for my brother.
Come on Mahir, hurry,
it's still hot.
The assumptions we make
about girls Salik.
That if you're rude to a girl,
she'll love you.
If you ignore her,
she'll come after you.
If you show her attitude,
she'll fall for you.
All these assumptions are a lie,
false and fake.
What happened?
Let me know.
Whatever they show
in the films is fake.
Nothing like that happens
in real life.
Sounds like a good story,
tell me all the details.
Let it go.
I am really angry right now.
Don't say anything to me.
"Good story".
Seems like you just got insulted
by a beautiful woman.
Well all of that wasn't wrong.
It's an exceptional case that
you got a difficult woman.
Who was it?
No one.
And nobody can insult me.
Mahir.
I was thinking
she is impressed by me.
But it's nothing like that.
She's asking me to marry Mona.
That means she has no feelings
for me in her heart.
Hello?
Hello? Rania, I'm Anjum.
Staff Anjum, from the hospital.
Oh, sister Anjum,
how are you?
Rania, Mahir got into an accident,
he's at our hospital.
What?
How? Is he alright?
They just brought him here, I can't say
anything about his condition.
Please come fast.
Okay, we're coming.
Damn, that's what happens
when you order online.
I ordered golden they delivered silver.
Uncle.
Come on in Rania.
Uncle, uncle.
Hey?
He's sleeping.
Aunt, aunt,
where are the keys to his bike?
It's there.
What happened?
Why do you seem so worried?
Mahir got into an accident.
I am going to the hospital,
you wake him up.
I don't know in what condition
he must be.
Oh God, mercy.
Hammad, wake up.
Hammad,
Hammad,
Hammad.
Wake up.
What happened?
Now one can't even sleep
peacefully in this house?
Mahir got into an accident,
he is at the hospital.
Wake up, wake up fast.
When? How?
Where?
Are you going to ask
for all the information here
or do you want to go to the hospital?
Wake up fast.
Open your eyes,
it's an emergency.
Here are your slippers,
what happened?
Oh God, wear your slippers.
Oh God, go now.
My poor Mona, she got affected
by the evil eye.
What do I do?
Nail paint hasn't dried yet.
Nurse, it hurts really bad.
I can feel at least one of my bones
is definitely fractured.
You people didn't examine correctly.
Check again,
I'm saying check again
there must be a fracture.
You're all right, just some minor injuries.
You'll be perfectly fine
in a few days.
Nothing happened, stay calm,
new brother-in-law.
What?
Brother-in-law?
Who is brother-in-law,
whose brother-in-law?
I'm not a new brother-in-law,
don't hurt me more by calling me that.
You're so funny, still joking
in such a condition, wow.
I've called your woman, she must be
flying to the hospital.
Who did you call?
That Rania?
My pain isn't getting any better.
I think the painkiller
you're giving me is fake.
This whole hospital is useless.
All of you should put a lock
on this hospital.
Really?
Then let me do something,
I will give you an injection,
that too a big one.
What?
No, no, no, no,
I don't want an injection.
I'll see who dares give me
an injection.
That's our job,
let me call the male nurse,
he'll easily give you an injection,
calmly.
You won't even feel it,
honestly.
No, no, hey nurse, listen.
I don't want an injection.
Nurse.
I don't know what hospital is this.
My leg is already hurting
and now they want it to hurt even more
by giving an injection.
Hello? Send 2 male nurses.
Yes, yes, they're needed.
Fast.
Sister Anjum.
Don't give me any bad news.
Oh God, this yearning is called love.
Calm down,
nothing happened to your hero.
Just some minor injuries.
But I don't know why he is yelling
at us lying on the bed.
What? Minor injuries?
That means it wasn't a
major accident?
So I came here in such
a hurry for no reason?
I got saved from several accidents.
This spoiled man must be driving rash,
why won't he get into an accident?
His mind is always on the 7th skies,
seems like that's exactly
where he wants to go.
Where is he resting now?
First room on the first floor,
go and meet your lover.
Yes Salik,
what's in it for the biker,
he swayed away.
My car collided,
it was a big loss.
And on top of that
I'm at the hospital.
You?
You, how did you come so fast?
Not my fault,
sister Anjum described the crisis
in such a way that I came like a hurricane.
But you are quite alright.
All my tension and worries are wasted.
Oh, that's so bad.
Nurse should have given you the news of
my death considering your tension and worries.
And why are you even here?
I don't even need your help.
Go away.
You're absolutely right,
people like you do not deserve help,
they deserve a punishment.
What records for the speed did you
want to make, with your big car?
You think of poor people as a bug.
Disgusting.
Tell me,
what has happened to the poor child
you ran over with your car?
Oh God, who knows how many families suffered
the death of their beloved due to this cruel person?
Oh, brake, brake, hit the brakes.
Nothing happened to him,
he went away swaying his bike.
My car crashed,
my leg is hurt
and it seems like you got
an injury to your brain.
Staff, patients have some rights.
I don't want to see this girl,
take her away.
Aww, true love must be like this.
See how he forgot his own pain
over your worries.
He can't see you sad that's why
he's asking you to go.
Aww, you both will write the tale
of true love in this era.
Before you came, he disturbed
the whole hospital with his screams,
and look at him now.
How he’s at peace quietly, for you,
just for you Rania.
Well I brought this injection
but I don’t think he needs it anymore.
But I’m right outside if needed.
What were you thinking?
What worlds did you want to explore?
If grandmother finds out
she’ll lose her mind.
And uncle Dabeer?
How worried he’d be
in a foreign country.
And that Mona would be
worried the most.
I think she might’ve fainted
after hearing the news by now.
She’d be having seizures.
Are you going back with respect?
Or do I call the doctor
to get you banned?
Get me banned,
but let me check first did you even get injured
or all this chaos is for no reason?
Doctor.
I was already in so much pain
and then you.
Grandmother,
Oh my child,
what happened?
Do you need help?
Get away.
May God forgive us,
not even an enemy would need
your help.
What happened brother?
How are you?
Slowly.
Grandmother,
my foot hurts really bad.
Careful.
Give charity in his name.
She’ll fall.
Here, take this strong shoulder.
I am unable to walk.
Careful, careful, careful, careful.
Uncle.
Shehenshah, go lift him.
Shehenshah, go.
Go help him.
Hold his hand.
I can’t walk, aunt please give me
some support.
Thousands of thanks to God,
it wasn’t a fracture.
Oh God, what are you saying?
Thankfully his leg is fine.
It’s very painful.
Oh God, whose evil eye affected
my happy and thriving household?
What accident happened
to my prince?
Look at him,
his complexion is pale as yellow.
Mother, no.
I think Tipu hit Mano again.
Tipu, hold on a minute.
That chaos doesn’t end.
Grandmother, pray for me.
Praying.
Although he does not need my help.
But I have taken it on me to make his
pale complexion back to normal again.
See, I made such a healthy soup,
it’s a crab soup.
Only the fortunate ones get
to have a soup made by me.
Come one, hurry up,
Open your mouth fast, good job.
No, no, I don’t want any soup, any crab.
I’m feeling better than before.
I don’t want it, go.
If you don’t take the soup, how will you
take the medicines you innocent?
You have to have the soup.
Good job my child.
No, no, no.
I’m not going to have this soup.
What did you say?
You won’t, have it?
No.
You have to.
Or I’ll ask uncle Hammad and Shahenshah to hold
your nose opens your mouth and pour all of it.
What is this behavior?
Good, that’s like a good boy,
good job.
Come on, open your mouth again.
What is this? How I’m stuck
in this trouble?
Have it, have it my child.
I don’t want this soup.
Should I take their help?
Open your mouth,
open your mouth.
Good, good job.
Don’t worry all your bones are saved,
your eyes and ears are fine.
Just take a rest and you will be fine.
And decrease your overacting,
it’s very obvious.
Mona will be here,
she’ll take care of you.
She’ll engage you in sweet conversations
and then everything will be alright.
I don’t want to listen
to anything sweet
There is no need
for anyone to come,
I am already telling you,
uncle say no to that Mona.
Hey, that’s the way to talk?
That poor girl is taking out some time
from her busy routine
to give company to someone
as boring as you.
And you’re not done
with your tantrums.
Okay now get straight,
it’s time for your medicine,
we’ll take medicine.
You can go from here,
I can take my medicine.
My hands and legs are fine.
No, no, no, no, uncle Hammad,
don’t listen to him.
Psychopaths like him throw away
their medicines to elongate their illnesses.
So they could get attention
from the people.
He’ll have to take medicines
in front of us.
To hell with you.
Why would I do that uncle?
Shehenshah, hold his hands.
Hey, don’t even get close to me.
Come on.
I’ll not give you the salary for the month.
Get away, go away.
Good job.
God is sufficient.
It’s so bitter,
what illness is it going to cure?
Ruined my taste buds.
He got the energy.
Get sweets for me.
Next medicine.
Next medicine?
That’s important.
I’m not sick.
No, I, I, I, I feel better.
I’m feeling better.
I feel like I’m fine.
Pack this one.
For how much?
2,500/-
What? 2,500?
No then, leave this one.
Where is the small one?
Tell me about this?
Pack this one, this one is nice.
This will be 2,450/- for you my sister.
2,450 rupees? Are you.
What happened?
Be considerate of a sister.
I need to give this to a patient.
Sister, 2,450/- is the least I’m willing to go,
not more than that.
Oh God, you’re looting people.
I can get a pair of sandals
for the same.
Then do one thing, buy sandals
and give it to the patient.
Shut up,
I don’t like excessive joking,
especially from you.
How much for this?
Sister, this is for 500/-.
What? This is also for 500?
I’m not going to pay anything
more than 100/- for this.
And if that Rania hadn’t insisted,
I wouldn’t have wasted this 100/- either.
Take this.
Sister, 100/-?
Shut up, okay bye.
You?
What are you doing here?
Thank God,
you’ve escaped death.
Or our future planning would’ve
been left incomplete.
If I’ve escaped,
then let me escape.
Why are you here to terrify me
in this black dress?
I understand well,
you’re angry at me, right?
That I came to meet you too late?
Actually, I went to get a flower.
Rania told me to get a flower.
So much of my time was consumed
in bargaining.
God forgive us all, things to leave
on graves have also gotten expensive.
But I still bought one for you.
Yellow flower?
Does that mean you want me
to stay sick like this forever?
Oh God, when did I say that?
I really don’t want it.
This was the cheapest
so I got this one.
What did you do?
He agreed on 100
after such a long argument.
If you didn’t want one
you could’ve told me,
I would’ve had ice cream
for 100 rupees.
I already have a headache,
do not make it worse
with your voice.
And go away, go.
Okay I’ll be quiet.
Okay listen.
Oh man, leave me alone.
Please, please, please, go away.
Please.
Okay then I’ll sit outside,
call me if you need anything.
Bye.
Are you asleep or awake?
You’re awake.
Now why are you here?
I told you,
I really don’t need this
efficiency of yours.
Please leave me alone
for a while, please.
I know, I know, I know that you want
to see Mona in place of me?
No problem, have these fruits,
I’ll call her in a minute.
Oh hello, hello, hello?
Please, there is no need
to call anyone.
I am okay, I am fit and fine.
You are getting shy?
Why are you hiding it from me?
I know everything,
Mona told me all about
your love story with her.
I made Mona my sister,
which makes you my brother-in-law.
And brother-in-law and
sister-in-law can joke, right?
It’ll be fun,
just wait for 2 minutes,
I’ll get her right away.
Hey, hey, hey? Listen, listen.
There is no need to call her. Listen.
God, why is it happening to me?
Hello?
Hey, Shehenshah, is it you?
Can you not hear me?
Yes, tell me if everything is fine at home?
Everything alright?
Where is everyone? Where is the mother?
Where is Mahir?
Master, Thank God, but brother Mahir
got into an accident.
But don’t worry,
don’t get tensed,
God blessed him
with another life.
What are you saying?
What nonsense?
Are you informed right?
Where is my Mahir?
Did he get severely injured?
Yes but when he’s in pain I look after him,
I massage his legs sometimes.
Oh God, Thank God.
Thank you God that
you saved my son.
You saved my centipede.
Why are you not letting me talk to him?
Let me talk to him.
That.
Rash driving,
the arrogance of big cars.
When they drive like the road
is their father’s property,
that’s exactly what the results will be.
Thank God that he’s saved.
But let your pampered child know
that fate isn’t always so kind.
Well, his condition is fine now.
Just screams here and
there to get attention.
But listen to me,
you really need to scold him.
Let him know to drive like a human.
He’s a human,
but I’ll tell him to drive carefully.
Okay then I will go inside and
let you talk to him on a video call.
And get a firm tone in your accent.
Bye.
Why don’t you clearly tell grandmother?
Why can’t you tell her that you do not
want to marry Khawar? Simple.
It won’t matter if I talk to her or not.
Grandmother thinks that she has made
the best decision in the world for me.
But that’s plain cruelty, and we should
protest against this cruelty.
We can’t do anything now.
Now only Rania can do something.
She is our only support and
she has told me to believe in her,
that she will make everything right.
And also,
brother Mahir is strictly against
this relationship.
So why can’t he do anything?
He pretends to be smart all the time.
Yes he might have done something
but he got into an accident.
Yes, okay, okay.
Listen, I’ve talked to my mother about you.
And thank God, she has finally decided
to make you her daughter-in-law.
We are just waiting for you.
I’ll bring my family
whenever you ask me to.
To ask for your hand in marriage.
No, no. Not yet.
Let Rania come up with a solution first.
Then bring your family, not before that.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Your father called,
he wants to talk to you.
Here, talk to him.
Hello father?
How are you father?
Many congratulations to you,
it’s all a result of your prayers
that your son is sitting here alive
and well.
Father, it was a narrow escape.
My foot?
Look at it father,
look at the swelling,
look here at the side,
see.
It hurts a lot.
That’s exactly what should’ve
happened to you.
Yes, did your brain get
into the right place
or you’ll do the same things
after getting out of the bed?
What do you mean?
What do you mean
by what do you mean?
Why were you in a hurry?
Why was there a need to do rash driving?
Did you give time to somebody
that you had to reach there then?
You can’t drive calmly?
Who told you that?
Who told me that?
I still have a lot of well-wishers in that house,
true well-wishers
So what do you think?
I get all the updates.
These true well-wishers of yours
just appeared a while back?
If you keep believing in them,
then I,
your own son will be soon
standing outside the house.
Oh stop it, don’t be dramatic.
You’re acting.
Why are you on the bed like girls?
You’ve defamed me.
Be a man, be a man, and get up.
Lying on the bed.
I didn’t expect this from your father.
Bye.
What?
Here you go, crying over the facts.
100 witches must’ve died
to make a place for you.
There is a limit to being a snitch.
You were the one to tell all of this
to my father?
Yes, I told him.
You enjoy here and your poor fathers
get worried there.
That’s why I told him what’s the truth,
what’s wrong with that?
Oh, how can you ever be wrong?
We are wrong,
you are always right.
Thank God at least you get it now.
Let me recover first,
then I’ll tell you what Mahir Ahmed is.
To this day no girl has ignored me,
and her attitude isn’t getting any better.
Wants me to get with that Mona?
If I couldn’t make you fall in love,
then my name isn’t Mahir Ahmed.
Challenge accepted.
Thank God, brother Mahir is better now.
I got really scared when
I heard about his accident.
Sister is he getting the right treatment?
You shouldn’t have brought him home
so soon.
You could have told me,
I would’ve taken him to
an expensive hospital.
He would be more comfortable there
than at his home.
Listen to me, we could have also
taken him to an expensive hospital,
we're never short of money here.
But the doctor himself told us
that his injuries are not that deep,
so why do you want to keep him
on the hospital? Right?
Uncle, Mahir is perfectly fine,
he'd be running like a horse
in a few days.
Yes, if God wills.
Sister Saman, can I have you
for a moment?
I need to talk to you
about something important.
Well sister,
I've bought shares at a hospital,
you could've taken him
to that hospital.
They'd all be at your service,
he'd have fun.
Is your mind in the right place?
They have already committed
Whatever you are saying,
considered it impossible.
I do not want to marry him,
have you looked at his face?
He looks like an alien.
I don't want to get married.
Have you heard what kind
of names she is calling him?
How will she ever respect him
as a husband?
Your brother-in-law's life will be ruined.
Yes.
Grandmother has already given her word.
She won't change that,
it's against her principles.
That's why I am telling you,
pressurize your brother-in-law.
Tell him to say no or
it won't be good for him.
Shehenshah,
go get Khawar a little, fast.
Why should I get only a little of Khawar?
I should get him whole.
Okay, go get him fast.
You are not doing right
with my brother-in-law.
Look at her, still thinking
about her brother-in-law,
doesn't care about her sister.
I won't get engaged to that dumb head.
Take him away from here.
Rabail, you're speaking a lot,
along with your excessive thinking.
Shehenshah,
since I got injured,
you've stopped listening to me.
I've been calling you for so long.
Mr. Injured, you arrived
at the right moment.
I think we should settle the matter
between Rabail and Khawar.
Okay?
Come have a seat here.
Come on.
Bring me a glass of water,
I'm thirsty.
Mr. Khawar, come,
take a seat.
Yes so Mr. Khawar,
what did you think,
when are you going to say no to
this relationship with Rabail?
See, it's not as easy.
That's what I am saying,
the elders decided to form
this relationship.
And their decisions are like
a carving on a stone.
I don't understand this,
what is this obsession our family has,
they carve on every stone.
Listen to me, hurry up and decide
when are you going to say no?
Brother, what can I say?
You are not as innocent
as you pretend to be.
See grandmother's taunts,
father's beating will be on my side
and brother Arbab will get angry as well,
I can't say no.
Please understand.
Okay so, imagine, just imagine.
At the exact time of engagement,
a woman enters the venue
with a child.
And as she enters, she announces
that she is your wife.
And you're the father of that child.
Then imagine
how much you'll get beaten up
from all 4 sides.
Imagine, and count the beating.
And your picture will be printed
in the newspaper.
It'll be so much fun.
People love to hear
about spicy rumors,
and they spread the word as well.
I accept, whatever you'll say I accept.
I'll say no but I really care
about my honor.
I knew it, my sweet brother
will definitely do as I say.
I'll sacrifice my life for you,
you've respected the word of your sister.
Now go inside and enjoy a free party,
grandmother has made really good
arrangements to show off her greatness.
Eat as much as you want.
And listen,
when you’re done eating,
stand firm
and just say no in front of everyone,
okay?
Go now, good luck.
Oh my brother-in-law.
Why do you look upset?
Celebrate it, dance and sing.
What happened?
We’ll get you ice cream later.
That’s exactly how I look,
and I’m not interested in playing music
nor in eating.
Your wish, we’ll definitely go.
I am only tolerating you
because of Rabail.
Cheap girl.
And we have to go inside and
look like we’re enjoying.
Because grandmother would know
looking at your sobbing face.
And yes,
Farhad has to look the happiest
at this event,
so nobody would doubt.
Do you understand?
You’re really nice.
Thank God, it happened.
I’m getting more scared now.
What if that Khawar refused
to do that?
I’ll have to marry him?
Nothing like that will happen,
calm down and have the ice cream.
I’m here, I’ll manage everything.
Hey, Doctor?
What are you doing here?
Greetings.
Greetings.
Why are you so surprised?
Do you think all the doctors spend
their lives at the hospital?
They shouldn’t have anything
to do with the outside world?
Wow, you’re smiling a lot today,
also talking really sweet.
Oh no, and to be honest,
I’ve learned to smile from you.
From me?
How?
Now I can casually talk to people,
make casual conversations,
smile and laugh.
You’ll learn everything in near future.
Oh and they’ll be getting married soon,
you have to come, okay?
Oh I didn’t introduce.
This is Rabail, my cousin.
And you’ve met Farhad,
and you know Laiba very well
she was your patient.
Laiba? How are you now?
I’m perfectly fine.
But I miss your scolding.
