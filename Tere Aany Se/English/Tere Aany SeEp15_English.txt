Grandmother,
grandmother
Where is grandmother?
She's sleeping in her room.
If you need something you can tell me.
This Rania, this girl.
Calling her a girl is
an insult to all girls.
She is a witch that roams around
in our home.
She's always having meetings
with useless people.
There is Mona, look at her.
I've never seen her having meetings
with random people.
Whenever I see her she's sitting
somewhere quietly,
and doesn't talk to anyone.
But that Rania,
makes relationships with everyone.
She's a stupid girl.
That means, you have a lot of
complaints about Rania.
You don't like her at all?
So what is so good about it?
You won't understand,
it's a deep thought.
Look at Mona, she understood
because my Mona is very smart.
She understands the depth of things.
No matter who I talk to, everyone
becomes a philosopher in this home.
I'm going to my friend's house.
Inform grandmother
when she wakes up.
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry,
our Mona will manage everything
in your absence.
I'm going to my friend's house,
not to a war or a heist.
"She'll manage everything".
Then why do you look like
an angry bird?
Because, because I'm angry.
On Rania?
All of our assumptions were wrong,
there is no such thing like that.
Doesn't matter, he doesn't have
a thing with me either.
Are you deaf?
He was admiring you,
Mona this, Mona that.
Didn't you hear that,
stupid girl.
Listen to me,
that will increase eventually,
that's how it all starts.
Sure?
Yes, God promise.
Yes.
I was thinking if I should go
and get ready.
What else do we need
to do to get ready?
If I apply a little blush
I'll look better.
Wow man.
What is it?
You look delighted today.
Even you look happier today.
I'm always happy, nothing new.
Won't be happy for long.
She doesn't even know
but Mahir thinks about her.
Can I go and tell her if you let me?
No, you'll get the evil eye.
Have you gone mad?
Do not make a mistake like this.
She'll start to compete
with you out of jealousy.
We have to win over
such people with love.
Just once your relationship is finalized
so I'll get rid of all my worries.
I'll ask Hammad to talk to mother
in subtle hints in a day or two.
And when mother is convinced,
our game will succeed.
And yes, try to get the sympathy
of this social worker.
She'll help you win over Mahir.
I was thinking should I send him
my TikTok?
Yes, yes.
Here
Let's make it.
Take a selfie first.
Yes.
What happened?
Hey brother?
What happened?
Why is your face so dull?
Something happened right?
Tell me.
What do I tell you, man.
Ifrah is mad at me,
girls have a different psyche.
If they love someone, they get mad
at him and they ignore him.
She talks a lot,
it's all so strange.
Rania also ignores me,
and gets mad at me as well.
Does that mean
Rania also loves me?
What is there to smile about?
No, nothing.
Listen to me,
nobody can understand girls
better than me.
You should start ignoring
Ifrah right back,
don't receive her calls,
and show some attitude.
Then you will see how
she comes running after you.
Brother, keep such suggestions
to yourself for God's sake, okay?
If you had ever loved someone
then you'd talk about it.
Getting mad, showing attitude
is a right of a beloved.
And making up to them is
a lover's responsibility.
Brother, look. You don't need to love
in order to advise other people.
Haven't you watched it
in the movies?
When a hero is giving
his girl an attitude,
she falls deeply in love with him.
Just for once take my advice
and then you'll see,
how Ifrah will get crazy after you.
You're always up to talk about movies.
Dude, just try it once.
And brighten up, and chill.
How can we chill?
Don't make karhai extra spicy
Just make sure the meat is properly tender
because if it takes a lot to chew it
loses the taste.
Okay?
What are you looking at my face?
Go my brother, leave.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Get me the phone.
Hurry.
I should also get you that thing
to scratch the itch.
Because if you move your hand you'll lose
some weight and might get tired as well.
Yeah, give.
If you want, do I also scratch?
It'll reach there.
Oh no, no, no, no.
I'll do it myself, I'll do it.
Hammad.
Stop this music,
I need to talk to you urgently.
I'm listening, speak.
I'll be listening with my ears.
Yes?
You'll go to mother and talk about
Mahir and Mona's relationship.
Listen to me, it's your and
your sister's matter,
keep me away from him.
Hammad.
Oh God.
You are talking like this relationship
won't benefit you in any way.
It's not easy to marry that obnoxious
and arrogant man.
My sister is ready for this sacrifice.
And also ready to jump in a hell
named Mahir.
Okay so tell her to jump
but I won’t talk to mother,
I'm already so tired after explaining
everything to Shehenshah.
Wife, wife, listen to me.
If I go and talk to mother about this,
her answer will end up insulting me.
Mona is pretty clever,
tell her to try herself.
It won't be difficult for her to get
a simple guy like Mahir.
Just like how you got me.
Just tell her to trap Mahir,
and spare me, I won't talk
to mother, not me.
I am done saying
what I wanted to say,
and you only do
what I told you to.
Understand?
I am starving.
I'm so glad you visited,
I was missing you a lot.
Are you alright?
You're fine?
Yes grandmother,
I'm really happy.
Today, at the breakfast table,
uncle said
you didn't visit your family in a while.
Go, meet them, and Khawar was available
so he said he'll take me.
Actually Arbab is going out of town,
he's starting a new project.
And you know who'll manage it?
Our Khawar.
Really?
Yes.
Wow, congratulations son, good job.
Yes grandmother, that's why we thought,
let's bring fruits and sweets to celebrate.
Son, there was no need for it,
we have enough fruits at home.
We brought it with our choice.
Oh, great people are visiting today.
How are you?
I'm good, you tell.
You look really pretty.
You too.
Khawar, how are you?
All good thanks to God,
we've started a new project
so we're here to get blessings
from grandmother.
By the grace of God,
such a beautiful mindset you have.
Men should be working like this.
Men who are not doing anything
are a burden on this earth.
So now that you're earning,
I'd suggest get married.
See, he got shy.
Well, being shy is a trait of pious men.
The men who don't change
an expression are already lousy.
No grandmother? Am I saying
something wrong?
Oh that's right, listen to me
Call Mahir, tell him that Saman
and Khawar are here,
come and greet the guests,
what is he doing?
Sure, it'll get him.
Yes, go.
Why are you sitting here?
We have guests over, go arrange
some tea or snacks.
Go now.
So son, will you stay here for work
or you'll move to another city?
Yes if brother says so I'll have to go,
otherwise I'm here.
By the grace of God.
Our Khawar is very obedient.
Yes, why not, why not.
Oh wow, Mr. Mahir.
Such personality you've got.
Thank you God,
thank you so much.
Girls don't wish for getting
you for no reason.
But the moon isn't written
in everyone's fate.
I think,
this Rania is also into me.
Probably that's why she keeps getting
into arguments with me.
She's looking for the excuses
to talk to me.
She wants my attention,
I understand everything.
Come on in.
Come on out.
Why?
Do you want to go out with me?
Didn't I tell you?
I don't need you
in order to go out.
Sister Saman is here and
her in-laws as well,
so please come and greet them.
Is that it? Or are you going
to ask anything else as well?
What am I going to get by asking
anything to you?
I don't have time for
irrelevant arguments,
or I would have answered in detail.
Okay, I won't argue with you,
I'll accept your answer.
Well I'm understanding all of this.
Arguing with me on petty issues,
fighting,
interfering in my matters.
Why don't you say it clearly?
That you.
Oh God,
I don't have time to hear
your newsletter.
Everyone is waiting for you
at the table so please come.
And yes, everyone is really happy,
keep the use of your tongue
as minimum as possible.
Just please don't ruin anything, okay?
Come on now.
That's also her way.
Thank you God.
What a personality I've got.
Hey go and.
Listen to me, go get Seema
and her sister.
Or else later she'll say
we didn't even ask her.
Sit down.
Mother, both the sisters
have gone shopping.
Their shopping never ends.
Okay, Khawar tell me,
are you interested in work?
We have to take interest
in work grandmother.
Ask sister-in-law,
how hardworking I am.
Yes, he's absolutely right.
Grandmother, he's such a
hardworking boy.
See, how fortunate Rafique Ahmed is.
He got rich and yet how respecting
and hardworking his children are.
Not like our offspring.
Okay mother, I should get going.
Why? Is it past your bedtime?
Sit here quietly.
We have guests over,
at least consider that.
Rabail my child make tea.
Oh, Rabail will do it, leave it.
You make it, at least care
about something.
Khawar, take the snacks,
fresh and hot snacks.
No grandmother.
Here you go.
Just a bite.
No, no.
Have it.
Listen to me, don't rush to go back.
Instead, be comfortable,
go after dinner.
Grandmother, there are other people
in this house as well.
Whom you could ask for snacks.
You also only think about yourself
like your uncle.
Grandmother, I've taken an oath
that I'll take my business to such heights
that the world will admire.
Wow, think like that,
there is no limit to imagination.
What I have to say is, uncle set up a factory
or two in your imagination as well.
You made really good tea.
Are you still sleepy?
I think mother, now I should get going.
Oh, grandmother, it's a business call,
I have to attend to this.
Oh, it's a business call?
Yes.
It's for work?
Yes.
Hello?
Mona, why are you sitting here?
You look a little upset,
what happened?
I'm going back.
So soon?
Yes, because it doesn't matter
if I live here or not.
Mahir disappointed me a lot.
He didn't even consider
our childhood friendship.
And he became so arrogant
and forgot everything.
Then why should I
stay here anymore?
Hey, that's it?
And you're disappointed so soon?
Mahir isn't as arrogant
as he seems like.
If you talk to him calmly, with love,
he understands.
Okay, let me try once?
But don't go till then, please stay.
Please.
You, you're going to talk
to him for me?
You'll convince him?
Yes,
I'll do anything it takes to get you
both together. I swear.
I want to be a prime minister.
This is a small issue.
Just remember that
we're friends from now on.
You have a friend named Rania
in this world that'll make Mahir yours.
Thank you so much Rania,
you're really sweet.
Thank you,
I knew that already.
What?
That I'm sweet.
Listen to me, when you'll
go to talk to him.
No Salik, I'm not coming today.
Grandmother taunted me in such
a sweet manner today.
What do I say, it killed the mood.
Grandmother taunted you?
That's surprising.
Not only that, she taunted me
in front of everyone.
Looks like you got insulted
in front of Rania
and that's why you're upset.
Right?
Dude, I don't know what do you have
against her?
If you look at her from my point of view,
she's a great person.
Leave that Rania,
tell me is Ifrah talking to you again?
Brother, all good, all good.
I'll say, you're an expert
in these matters.
You were right.
Girls only show attitude till
we give them attention,
and once you stop giving them
the attention,
they'll settle down.
And about Ifrah,
her anger is settled,
she's running after me.
And it all happened because of you,
thank you because you've really
helped me brother.
When you follow brother's advice,
you'll always.
Hey, I'll call you later.
Okay then we'll meet later.
For how long are you going
to smile for?
You'll get tired.
Confess what you have in your heart.
No, there is nothing special.
I just came here randomly.
I thought you might be rotting
in the room
so I should give you company.
Really?
I was just thinking about you.
Really? See,
the devil's name
and the devil appear.
No, no, I won't call you a devil.
Do you know,
I had all the wrong assumptions
about you,
you're not like that at all.
Really?
What did you assume about me?
I used to think you're full of yourself
and not good for anything.
And your personality is extremely misbehaving,
shameless, and inconsiderate.
And I had decided that I'll be the one
to teach him a lesson.
Why are you making such faces,
I'm telling you,
they were just assumptions.
And congratulations to you,
for the first time in my life,
my assumptions were wrong.
I swear.
The weather outside is really nice,
such a refreshing breeze.
Let's go to the lawn?
I'll also make tea for you.
Okay,
you want me to come
to the lawn with you?
Yes,
let's go?
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go?
Stupid girl, she's thinking
I'm enchanted by her.
And I'm singing songs in her love.
She's so mistaken.
Ms. Rania,
I'll make fun of you so bad,
that you'd hide from everyone.
Application for leave.
Respected Madam Sweetie.
It is my kind request that on February.
February? Oh again,
he wants to have days off from
work so he could meet his family.
Please accept his absence
for a few days.
Sincerely, your servant.
Dabeer Ahmed.
It was such a small thing and Dabeer
you were scared for no reason.
Look at this,
now I'll put this on her bedside.
She'll read this application
and sign just like this.
Now go Dabeer, prepare for it,
you don't know when the moment
of acceptance would be.
Very kind of you.
Bye.
Anything special?
You wanted to tell me
in this pleasant environment?
Carry on.
Everything I say is special.
Okay.
So randomly I was thinking,
now even your friends are getting married.
And Salik and Ifrah are
so happy together.
And grandmother,
grandmother is happy as well.
And their mothers?
They'll extremely happy.
Yes right, I know, then?
Oh, nothing,
I was thinking
don't give everyone
the similar happiness as well?
Oh,
she came to the point too soon.
No, no, I've thought
if anyone confesses their love for me,
I'll not disappoint them.
Instead I'll answer that with love.
Really?
You ended up being a really good person,
I was calling you names for no reason.
Poisonous snake, arrogant horse,
stubborn donkey.
Hey, that’s enough,
that’s enough respect.
Hello.
Farhad?
Are you here to teach the children?
Yes.
Wait for me right here,
I’ll get him to the children.
Stay here, okay?
Come.
Mona, I succeeded, the way is clear,
go shoot your shot.
Yes.
Go.
Poisonous snake?
She’s a poisonous snake.
Escaped the situation
by crawling away.
Hey Mona, get off me.
Hey, you recognize it’s me even
with your eyes closed?
Today I had a really important mission,
for which I forgave Mahir and
became friends with him.
See, my curse affected you,
at the end, you’re in love with him, right?
Hey?
I am yet to have such terrible days.
What happened?
What?
The weather is so pleasant, right?
This is pleasant?
It’s so sunny I feel hot.
Yes,
but one can capture really good pictures
in this sunlight, our pictures.
Go and get a picture with that tree,
the selfie will look good, go.
Really? Why? He’s cute,
I think many girls would die on him,
nobody would live though.
What do I do, die if they want to die.
My mindset is way beyond marriage.
I want to be something
after getting the education,
and I want to do something
for my country.
Very nice.
Come along with me,
we’ll get really good pictures.
Okay then, let’s go.
What are you looking at?
Pictures will look better from this side,
go there.
What are they talking about
for so long?
Listen, I don’t have the knowledge
of every living being,
I don’t know.
She looks really happy with this boy,
I don’t know why.
Because that boy makes her happy
if someone makes me happy like this.
I’d look happier and glow even more.
Listen if you’re done with the inquiry
then can we decide the spot to take pictures.
Shut up at least.
I don’t know what they were talking
and laughing about, for so long.
This guy is such a pervert,
I don’t like him at all.
Oh God,
but I like you a lot.
Go away.
Listen.
He didn’t even say bye.
Okay bye.
Where are you planning
to slip all secretly?
No, no, Madam Sweetie,
not secretly,
I’ve written a proper application
for leave.
Yes, this one, this is the one I wrote.
Not accepted,
not accepted.
Your request for leave is not accepted.
I’d written it with.
Go put this bag back
where you took it from.
Madam Sweetie,
there should have been a leave to meet
our loved ones at least once after so many years.
Am I not your beloved?
While trapping me and promising me
for marriage 20 years ago,
didn’t I say you’d do everything
according to my choice?
Then do this thing,
send me away from the country
with your own will,
just like how you throw me
out of the bedroom.
Shouldn’t I throw you
to the police station?
All it is going to take is a phone call.
That this illiterate man was beating me.
Please, I was kidding Madam Sweetie,
it was a joke.
You’re really jolly Mr. Dabeer.
You’re also really fake.
Really jolly, jolly.
I was joking,
I was joking,
I’m not going anywhere.
Dabeer, come here and
bring your suitcase.
Yes? Yes, coming, coming.
Sister, Saman told me that
you’ve been missing me,
I told Khawar to get
the new big car.
Sister missed me,
we have to reach there.
You’ve bought another car?
Yes grandmother, this time,
it’s a result of my hard work.
Okay then,
let me give you a gift
for your hard work.
Rafique Ahmed,
I don’t just say it, I truly value Khawar,
and think of him as my son.
That’s why I am thinking,
there should’ve been someone
to take care of him
The one who’d give him chicken with
original butter, so he could get healthy.
You’re absolutely right.
Uncle, how many teaspoons of sugar?
Oh my child, add 3-4 of them.
Okay.
And for that reason, Rafique Ahmed,
after a lot of thinking and analysing
the situation I’ve come to decide
that I want to get him married
to my daughter,
I want him to get together with Rabail,
if you do not object.
Sister, am I awake?
I mean, am I dreaming?
Oh, you were never going to think about it
so I decided on my own,
that along with Saman,
I want Rabail to go to the same family.
Thank you so much, sister. I’m indebted.
Hey, go get sister’s blessings and love.
Live long, live long, my son.
Oh stop it, if you stir it so much
the tea will turn into a juice.
Grandmother,
I want to say something to you.
I know you’re always there
to ruin everything,
so keep quiet,
I’ve made my decisions.
Mother-in-law,
I want to say something as well.
I know about you too,
how sweetly you speak, right?
You go and wake your husband to tell him
that mother made another amazing decision,
completing her hat trick.
Yes.
Mahir, go get some sweets,
so we could give it a sweet start.
Go, get going.
Sister, I’ve lost my senses after this amazing
decision of yours, all of them.
Rania, call Rabail.
She has been to neighbors,
unaware of the unfortunate future
she’s discussing the present with them.
I’ll go get her.
Show me your finger,
in which one does the ring go?
It’ll fit this one,
hey I’ve decided it
and made a commitment now
the discussion is complete.
Consider this an engagement ring.
Stop it sister, how much are you
going to cry?
Why do the elders always play with the
feelings of emotions of young generation?
I don’t understand why?
It’s not like the new generation asked them
before starting a relationship.
I won’t get married to Khawar.
How can grandmother do that to me?
It’s very cruel.
Stop crying Rabail.
How my brother dreamt
of the days.
Have you started a drama?
We won’t get anything by crying.
We have to think practically
in this scenario.
Think practically?
What do you mean?
I’m not the one to cry
and do nothing.
And I can do anything
for my friends.
Do anything you want
but please hurry.
I’ll forever be indebted to you,
please.
Let me think.
Yes, think.
Did you think of something?
No.
Didn’t think of anything.
Now?
No.
What are you doing?
Go sit there, sit there,
sit quietly.
There is one thing for sure,
I won’t let this happen.
A life partner should be one
who you like. Right?
Yes.
Rabail, do you like him?
Yes.
Look closely.
Yes.
You like her?
Yes.
Do you love each other?
Yes.
Okay then,
I’ll help you both get together.
I will.
Grandmother, I can’t even believe it.
How can you think like that?
How can you even think about making a guy
as dumb as Khawar a son-in-law of this house?
Even actual parents disown such kids.
Think about it, that alien being
the son-in-law.
Grandmother, I’m telling you,
this is not happening.
I’ll protest against it.
Stop it, “dumb”.
That dumb boy is a better
businessman than you.
Extremely responsible
and innocent child.
He is not surviving on
his father’s money.
He earns for himself.
And doesn’t even raise his head
in front of me.
That’s how I want my son-in-laws
to be for our daughters,
the one’s we can dominate.
Accept our superiority
and keep our daughters respected
and loved forever.
Grandmother,
what logic is this?
I accepted brother Arbab
when you insisted
but not Khawar.
I will never let it happen,
grandmother.
You have to change your decision.
I’m a family woman,
I don’t go against my word.
Okay, don’t listen to him,
but at least ask Rabail first.
If she even agrees to this relationship.
I’m not going to ask anyone,
I’ve made my decision and
now we’re done taking.
Grandmother,
grandmother you’re being really cruel.
I’ll never let this happen.
When Saman got married,
I was young, not wise enough.
Now I’m an adult, I have friends,
I have a social circle,
what are they going
to think about it?
Look at Mahir’s standard
and his class,
and look at his brother-in-law,
an alien.
Rabail doesn’t agree to this marriage.
And if Rabail doesn’t agree,
I’ll also never let this happen.
You won’t let this happen?
Really? What are you going to do?
Not only me, you’ll help me as well.
We’ll go to this Khawar’s house,
and first explain him nicely to say
no to this relationship.
And if he doesn’t accept then.
Then.
Then we’ll resort to threats.
Girls are being treated like
silent animals even in this era.
Their marriages are fixed
without their consent.
It’s cruel, it’s pure cruelty.
Okay, okay, calm down.
We’ll go, okay?
Wow, wow.
What a move you made.
Oh, welcome, welcome.
Come on, be seated.
This man is my brother-in-law and.
Greetings mister.
Greetings madam.
May God bless your pair,
may God bless you with a cute.
Enough, stop, stop.
Hit the brakes don’t say a word
beyond that.
What should I get for you people?
Ask for a slipper,
so you can be whopped
when needed.
Allah Rakhi, get two cups of coffee.
Okay.
I always wished my sister-in-law
to be humorous,
and what a joke you made, slippers.
I admire your sense of humor.
Hey brother-in-law, why are you quiet?
You can also chip in, I won’t mind.
Wow,
today you changed your skin
just like a snake.
We used to think you don’t even have
a tongue in that mouth.
Earlier you were my brother’s in-laws,
now that you’re my in-laws as well,
I feel like a family.
You know,
my confidence level increased.
Rania, tell him why we are here.
What?
Say no to this relationship.
