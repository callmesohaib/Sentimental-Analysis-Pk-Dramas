So how was the story?
Okay now so let's have a
singing competition,
I sing when I am really happy.
Raise your hand,
whoever wants to sing first.
You.
Me?
Wasiq, I will go and
wait in your room.
Okay?
Uncle,
stay for a while
the children would like it
and you might as well.
Sure.
Hey Rania, sing a song,
children are waiting.
Are you guys waiting?
Then let's sing together.
She gives a performance
wherever she goes.
She loves to seek attention.
Yay.
Hey, Mahir, you?
Come on, join us.
No thanks, I am having a sore throat.
And you.
Sister Anjum,
who are you talking to?
Have even heard his voice?
He sounds like a broken drum.
Children, children, children,
when this uncle sings,
it sounds like a crow
making a sound.
And, and, and, when he speaks,
it sounds like thunder.
That's why he's just staring.
Come on now, sit here.
Hey, Mahir, where are you going?
She's only joking to make
the children happy.
If you want to joke
to make children happy,
then do that to each other,
not to me.
And you,
I'll only wait 5 minutes
for you in the car,
if you get there in time then okay,
else goodbye.
Really?
This is what it is, then go
and attend grandmother's lecture,
you know how you'll get scolded
if you go back alone.
Now why are you standing here?
Go, go.
You've trapped grandmother
in your enchantment,
she is naive, she cannot understand it.
Really? Then thank God,
you understood.
Yes, I've understood really well.
Are you coming or should I leave?
Sorry children, I'll have to go.
But all of you make me a promise
that you'll take care of yourself.
Promise?
Good.
Okay then I should leave.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll visit again.
Dr. Wasiq, I'm leaving.
Thank you for coming Rania.
You responded to my first call.
And see how all the children have smiles
and hope on their faces because of you.
Thank you for coming.
You'll visit again?
Definitely.
It was good to meet you, uncle.
Now she'll fool this uncle as well.
Drama queen,
she doesn't spare anyone.
I hope to meet you again.
Hopefully.
Take care of yourself.
Bye.
Bye.
Let's go?
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know why
I don't like anything
when this useless person
is mad at me.
You really enjoyed?
To sit in the middle of everyone
and sing horribly?
Those children were sick.
They're staying in such a depressing
environment at the hospital.
If we had some fun to get rid of their
hopelessness then what's wrong with that?
So what am I saying about it?
I have nothing to do with this.
If you don't have anything to do with this
then why are you showing this attitude?
Anyways, I get annoyed
by upset faces,
so please kindly make
your mood better.
My mood is quite alright, okay?
Whether you sing or
dance like monkeys,
it really doesn't matter to me.
And who was the man you were
wanting to meet again?
Look here, tell me,
who was he?
I liked his daughter for you,
wanting to get you married to her.
Have you ever answered sanely
to any question?
Have you ever asked a sane question?
You always ask me questions
that make me mad.
Don't forget, your grandfather
sent you here for studies,
not for participating in
extracurricular activities.
And that Wasiq? That doctor.
I dislike him from the first day.
Who do you even like?
And how much do you know Dr. Wasiq?
You are saying as if
he's your childhood friend.
And that uncle too.
That uncle is a fraud as well.
I won't hear a single thing about him.
Do you understand?
Looking at you I am reminded of
an old lady in my area.
So?
You're like her,
she didn't like anyone either,
she criticized everyone, opposed everyone.
You're like that too.
If you miss that old lady or her uncle,
I don't care.
Do it in your heart, silently,
I don't want to hear that voice in my ears.
If my father were alive,
he would be exactly like him,
same face, and the same age.
How decent and sweet he is.
I don't know when will I get
to meet him again.
She actually got quiet.
Hope she doesn't complain
when we reach home.
I have to make alliances better,
let me ask for the ice cream.
She's greedy for that,
she'll say yes instantly.
Listen?
Do you want to have ice cream?
No, and don't disturb me again.
I want to stay quiet for a while,
you should also drive silently.
Rabail's in-laws want to have
a grand celebration for the wedding.
What? Really?
God, it'll be so much fun.
Hey mother, maintain a relationship.
But I'm telling you, don't hold
any celebration until I return.
I'm returning this time, secretly.
You have been giving the same hopes for
the last 20 years but you never returned.
Telling you, mother, this time I am returning,
definitely returning, very soon.
And I'll land directly at your feet,
in my paradise.
It'll be so much amusement and entertainment,
we'll have so much fun,
why did you send Mona so early?
I was going to talk to uncle Dabeer about
the marriage of that Prince Charming and Mona.
But Mona left,
who gives up that easily?
Seema, come here, come here,
fast, come on.
Here, talk to your brother-in-law,
but don't act like stupids, you don't
show your face or forehead.
Greetings brother Dabeer,
how are you? Alright?
Greetings, Seema, live long.
How are you? Alright?
And how is my idiot brother?
Hello, listen,
if you try to plan anything
by enchanting my father.
So keep in mind,
I'll get you married to uncle Rafique's son,
that lizard Khawar.
Cunning.
You're always making
strategies against me,
always wishing for my downfall.
I'll fix you,
let the right time comes.
Brother Dabeer, everyone
misses you so much here,
we really feel your absence.
Just return soon,
and see how your brother has managed
the whole house.
He took each and every responsibility
of this house on his delicate shoulders.
That's a lot.
Oh, by the grace of God,
you've told me a great news.
Greetings uncle, how are you?
Greetings, my child Rania,
how are you? Is everything alright?
Your uncle is coming back soon.
To Pakistan.
Okay tell me, what does my child want?
What should I bring you from here?
No I.
Oh yes, father,
bring her an extra tongue while returning.,
Her own isn’t enough
for her speaking skills.
Hey? Fair monkey,
you’re here as well?
Tell me how are your injuries now,
everything alright?
Injuries healed a long time ago,
but the brain still hasn’t recovered yet.
It seems like even the warranty
has ended for that.
You are correct.
Father, actually I.
Hey, father.
Brother Dabeer,
bring a lot of chocolates.
Yes, all the greedy ones are here,
waiting for you,
come soon with all the stuff.
Father.
Even if you don’t bring the perfumes,
chocolates.
Open your mouth Mano.
What happened?
Finish your breakfast fast
you are getting late for school.
Mother why do we have to eat
boiled eggs in the morning?
No Tipu, I think you’d be getting
beating instead of egg.
Aunt, I’ll make them eat the breakfast,
they listen to me.
Sure?
Sure.
Thank God.
Come on children, start eating.
Tell me what do you want to eat? Cake?
Yes.
Here you go.
What do you want?
Cake.
Good boy, here you go eat fast.
Wait a second.
Did you recite Bismillah?
Good job, and we should never
throw tantrums while eating.
We should just thank God
and start eating.
Okay? Eat now.
I made such a healthy soup,
it’s a crab soup.
Only the fortunate ones get
to have a soup made by me.
Okay now open your mouth,
fast, fast, good job.
Hello?
Who are you remembering
so early in the morning?
You are also smiling while remembering.
No, nothing.
You won’t understand.
I don’t understand? Okay then, let it go.
Have your breakfast it’s getting cold.
Rania,
can you pass me the tea?
Cake too.
There is an egg too, pass me that as well.
What happened?
Is your mind alright,
you are asking me for everything.
Seeing you, taking care
of everyone like this,
it reminded me of my mother.
Nobody gave me food like this,
nobody took care of me,
nobody cares about the small things.
Sorry,
I should get the car keys,
then I will have to drop you guys at school.
It looks like brother Mahir
is missing his mother.
Aww,
a child without mother,
who knows what he has
hidden in his heart,
really,
nobody can love like a mother.
He doesn’t have a mother, that’s why
he’s off the rails sometimes.
Children, if you are done with breakfast,
should we leave?
Yes, go safely, return safely.
Come on.
Come on Tipu.
Wait a second, wait a second, stop,
stop, stop. Thank God I remembered.
Done, now go.
Bye.
Come on, kids let’s go.
And yes,
so finish your lunch, don’t forget.
Yes.
He’s missing his mother
so early in the morning.
The way I miss my father,
he feels the absence of his mother.
Both of us have emptiness in our lives.
Our sorrow is alike.
So here we go Rafique Ahmed,
me and Rabail’s mother-in-law together,
are going to arrange a grand event.
So that people get to know that
Azra Jahan does not get her children
married off to some ordinary families.
And now you’re also
a part of our family.
Sister, you call so here I am,
because this useless son of mine
embarrassed me a lot.
I’m not even able to show
my face somewhere.
No, no, uncle,
there is nothing like that.
Look at it, it’s actually good
from one perspective.
See how our Rabail got such a nice boy.
If she had gotten together with Khawar
so what would the world say?
They’d express disappointment.
Rafique Ahmed, don’t be disheartened.
Considering how rich Khawar is,
he’ll get a lot of proposals.
Why are you getting worried?
He’ll be happy if he marries
someone of his choice.
I asked a lot, sister,
but he says I’ve always addressed
all the girls as my sisters
because all the girls only want that
from me, nothing else.
That’s inferiority complex,
it’s not even that bad Khawar,
what happened?
I’m here, I’ll look for a girl for Khawar.
I’ll tell them his car model and bank balance
before showing his face,
then we’ll see many proposals he’ll get.
No, no, there is no need for many,
we have our Mona.
We can get Mona married to Khawar.
Mona, you gave such a great idea.
Good idea, very good idea.
Listen, you were telling me that
Mona is getting committed?
No, no, it was just about to,
not married yet,
and Khawar is stronger
financially anyway.
How can Mona find
an amazing guy like Khawar?
We can’t find him.
Consider it yes from our side.
I’d suggest you all to think again,
because if my relationship
fails a second time,
I will get defamed and
nobody will marry me.
Listen Seema, ask Mona first,
discuss it at your home,
think about it,
it’s a matter of a girl’s life.
I’d suggest you get his information.
The decision has been made mother,
and Mona is my younger sister
I will say and she’ll agree.
Is such a nice, rich, wealthy guy,
it’s okay if he has a few flaws.
Here we go sister, we formed
another relation with your family.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
May God save us.
Did she make a decision
about my marriage?
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Congrats it’s a good thing.
The relationship is fixed,
congratulations to you.
Khawar and Mona’s.
Here my child, congratulations to you.
Many congratulations to you.
Once again I will be a
son-in-law to this family.
Sit straight, you son-in-law of the family.
I’ll go and inform Mrs. Khawar.
Yes, yes.
Come Mahir, sit here.
Here, eat something.
Yes, yes, have a snack.
Hammad.
Give me your phone fast, fast.
Here it is, pick it up.
Hello Mona, I have such
a great news for you,
I did not only find a really rich,
wealthy, innocent and naive guy for you,
I also decided on your relationship with him.
But why,
I did inform you the proposals here
are also about to be finalized.
It was about to happen there,
it has already happened here.
He’s so rich, house, properties,
mansions, cars.
You’ll have a luxurious life.
You are fortunate, fortunate.
There is only one truth in this world,
money.
Now look at me a useless, lazy person
is tied to me, now my life is ruined.
You, my love, you are fortunate.
Well tell me one thing, how did you
suddenly find a proposal for me?
Or did Mahir agree?
No, no, no, no, good looking prince
like Mahir aren’t good for marriage.
Their wives are always
worried about them.
Always having affairs here
and there.
At the end, they end up becoming
a heart patient.
That’s why I’ve chosen an extremely rich
but really innocent boy for you.
A boy, girls don’t even
look at him twice.
They call him brother as soon as
they see him.
What?
Who is he?
What are you trying to do with me?
I am your sister,
not your enemy,
that’s why I have chosen a gem
like Khawar for you.
What?
That Khawar?
Even Rabail doesn’t give him attention,
why are you giving him to me?
Oh that stupid girl will regret later.
Don’t think about Khawar,
think about the shopping malls
across the world,
where you will go to shop.
And listen once you get rich
don’t forget your poor sister.
Now hurry, book the tickets
and come, okay?
Love you.
Okay that’s fine but,
hello, listen to me.
Oh God, what do I do now?
When did this happen,
nobody asked me about it?
At least now realize
your value in this home.
Because you’re idle.
My room, this tidy?
Is this my room or someone else’s?
No, it’s your room,
I clean it myself,
changed a few things too.
Hope you don’t hate it.
No.
Actually, I wanted to apologize
to you for my behavior earlier.
Tea?
You’ll have tea? I’ll make one for you,
without sugar?
Let me get it for you.
Hello? Yes, Salik how are you?
Oh, I’m pretty good.
Do you know
I was confused about
one thing for a while?
I had never met a girl
who ignored me,
this Rania was the first,
but now she’s good too.
She’s impressed with me.
Today, just for me,
she cleaned my whole room
and even changed the setting.
Right now?
She went to make the tea,
without sugar.
Okay, I’ll talk to you later.
Bye.
Why am I happy that
she is giving me attention?
What happened to me?
Tea.
Thank you.
Without sugar?
I’ll have it.
She brought me tea,
smiled when she looked at me,
why do I feel so good?
It looks like Mr. Mahir,
you’re getting out of your mind.
Son if Mahir were home,
I would have never bothered you.
There is nothing like that grandmother,
it’s his responsibility as well
he is our future son-in-law.
And anyway,
the tradition of giving son-in-laws
an unreasonable amount of respect,
does not exist anymore.
Was it an appreciation
or an insult?
Yes, yes, grandmother,
Rania is absolutely right.
Actually Rania was the one to break
that tradition, just about now.
Yes of course, and I’ll break more
traditions like this on my way.
Rania my child, do one thing,
call Mahir and tell him.
That grandmother is only going to
the hospital for a routine checkup,
there is nothing to worry about,
pick us up on the way back.
What are you saying, grandmother?
You’re talking like a stranger, no, no.
If I picked you,
I’ll drop you as well, please.
God, thank you my child,
thank you.
Yes, yes, we’re just about to reach,
we’ll take a left and we’ll be there.
We’re there already?
Yes, yes.
Seema,
you’ve fixed Mona’s relationship
without asking brother or Mona,
when they’re also looking
for a boy for Mona.
Now if they reject,
we’ll have no respect here.
Hammad, as if you already
have so much respect?
Whatever I did, is really good.
I want my sister to live to the fullest,
with all her heart.
Do you understand?
Not like me, her sister, who’s deprived
of even the smallest things.
What do you think, I don’t feel like
traveling to England on first-class flights?
My hair to be glamorous.
To wear high heels and
shop at the malls.
And tremble and fall,
and the teeth fall out.
Then get the new ones,
on in-laws’ expenses.
“To travel in planes, get hairstyles,
wear heels”
Be grateful to God that you found
such an obedient husband.
The one who always stay
in front of your eyes,
you don’t have to investigate after him.
It was Zaman,
how would my eyes not recognize
my own nephew?
I think he didn’t look at me,
if he had, he would’ve recognized.
But what if he acted like a stranger
even after recognizing?
Greetings, brother.
Greetings.
How are you brother?
I’m good, sister, by the blessings of God.
You tell, I called to ask your condition.
I’m good too.
Your voice doesn’t sound
like you’re alright.
I can’t hear the thunder in your voice.
Ammar, I saw Zaman today,
after so many years.
Just think of it as a reflection
for a moment.
He just sat in a car and went away.
He didn’t see me.
Even if he had,
we would’ve passed you like a stranger,
he wouldn’t have stopped.
Just like how he left his wife, children,
and us, a while ago.
Do you miss him?
Sister, I called to ask about you,
how are you?
And how is Rania?
Your Rania is the life of our house,
it feels like she’s been here forever.
Okay listen,
Dabeer is returning from America,
you all have to be here,
the whole family.
All of you have to come
and stay here to attend 2-4 events as well.
But you have to visit, don’t forget.
Father,
father, I think my in-laws won’t respect me
as much as they should respect a son-in-law.
How do you think about this?
My son, I think the amount of respect
they give you is more than enough,
they shouldn’t even be
respecting that much.
Do you remember what you did
or you forgot?
I don’t understand what kind of father’s
support their children.
The ones whose children do things
that are worth supporting.
Remember what you did,
you disrespected
their beautiful daughter.
Broke off the engagement
in front of everyone.
But they proved,
they’re respected people.
We lost respect because of you.
Father I don’t get it
how do I make you understand?
Shut up and sit quietly.
Don’t ruin my tea.
Tea only tastes better when slurp it,
better to drink poison than drink tea
with etiquette like rich.
But father,
I’ve made a decision
that I’ll stay in attitude
with my in-laws.
Because I just read somewhere
that when people do not
respect themselves,
nobody respects them.
So now I’m done with disrespect,
now it’s time to get respect.
Hey,
go and feed my pet chickens.
Mr. respectable,
if you really want to care
about something?
Go take care of your beard.
Looking at it reminds me
of a broomstick
that has been disassembled
by a little kid.
Do something about them
or it’ll just remove its existence.
You look stupid since you rejected
Rabail on the engagement.
If you weren’t my son,
I wouldn’t let you marry
your whole life.
Yes my child Rania,
how are you?
All of this chaos was spread by Rania.
If she wouldn’t have forced me
to say no to Rabail,
father wouldn’t be angry at me.
But now just wait and watch Rania.
I’m coming back, as a son-in-law,
you all will regret it.
Here you go, grandmother.
Oh, my Dabeer is returning
after so many years.
I am so happy I cannot even tell you.
Do one thing my child set his room
under your supervision.
Okay grandmother, don’t worry
I’ll manage everything.
Please.
Walk fast, you guys become a tortoise.
Don’t you want to go?
Mother we are going on an outing,
we return late, don’t worry.
Okay, go, go.
But how will you go?
Salik took the car.
Okay then, plan canceled,
let’s go, let’s go.
Hammad, listen to me,
today, even if we have to go on a
donkey cart we’ll go for an outing.
Do you understand?
Don’t even try to go back to our room.
We’ll go on a bike.
What are you doing, if 4 of us sit on
the same bike it’ll pass away.
Haven’t you seen 7 people on a bike
in the city, we are only 4.
Today I think our bike will be sacrificed
for my wife’s plan.
Lazy, go take your children.
And Seema, make him
travel the whole city.
Okay, okay, mother.
Come on, come on.
Go, go my children, enjoy.
Thank you mother.
Mother promised.
God, I’m dead.
Hammad.
What are you doing?
You’re scaring us.
Wake up and let’s go.
Mother, where do I sit?
Sit on this tank.
Oh God.
Mother, I have to sit as well,
where do I sit?
Scoot a little more,
Tipu also has to sit.
Where do I go?
Sit on the handle?
Adjust him in the middle here.
Where do I adjust him
I am about to fall.
Scoot a little forward, father.
Do one thing, add another chair
at the back.
We’re not going anywhere,
you’ve started a drama.
Come on.
What do you mean?
It took me an hour to get ready,
we are going.
Let’s go.
Okay then you tell me how can we adjust
four people on this motorcycle. Tell.
None of my concern,
we are going.
Okay then the 3 of us will stay here,
you can go alone on the motorcycle.
Why do you always say illogical things,
you always ruin the mood.
Wait a second, wait a second,
what happened, why are you fighting?
Mahir, look at this, I always
have to kill my ambitions.
We were happy, we were going
on an outing but no, I am unfortunate.
What happened?
We can’t fit on the bike.
Okay then do this,
leave the children here,
you both can go.
Brother Mahir, we also want to go.
I’m here, I’ll take you both,
come on, come on.
Let your parents go,
come on.
Really? Thank you,
see our problem is solved.
Come on, get off.
Husband, do you have
any other excuse?
I was getting spared
you trapped me again.
Okay, bye.
Say bye to your parents.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Brother Mahir,
there is no car at the home,
how will we go?
Why are you getting worried?
Brother Mahir is here.
I’ll take you, we’ll call a cab,
but there is one condition.
Sister Rania?
Tell her to come with us.
To look after you,
you’re so difficult.
We’ll only go if she’s coming with us.
Yes, brother Mahir, it’ll be
more fun if she comes with us.
Really Mano? It’ll be fun with her,
not with brother?
Listen, go inside,
and call her.
How is that a difficult task,
I’ll get her.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don’t tell her that I called her.
You’re calling her
because you both insisted.
Obviously, she won’t come if you call her.
She doesn’t take you seriously.
Don’t say nonsense, do what is told.
He’s getting really annoying.
Brother Mahir,
do you like her just like us?
What? Rania?
Why would I like her?
She’s a witch.
I’m only taking her
so she could look after you.
Well I don’t understand
how do you all enjoy her company,
she is so boring.
Today will be so much fun.
Tipu said you called me?
What? I called you? Tipu.
He’s lying,
the children were insisting
that we’re going out
so we should take sister Rania as well,
I said okay, why not.
Really?
I also have to shop
for uncle Dabeer’s room,
so I’ll shop as well.
Also, should I change or it’s okay?
Change if you want to,
don’t if you don’t want,
why does it matter?
