Hey.
What happened to you? Get up.
What happened? Come to your senses.
Oh God. Water.
There is no water either. Get up.
Come to your senses. Is anyone there?
Brother.
Get up. Is anyone there?
Someone there?
Get up. What happened to her?
Why has she fainted? Get up.
Uncle. Uncle, come quickly.
Come and see, quickly.
Who is that child?
I am sure she is your sister.
How did she faint?
You tell me, how is she?
Did she regain consciousness?
All that will be told by Dr. Wasiq.
First you do one thing, pay the fees.
I pay the fees?
Have you seen my patient’s condition?
Have you seen my condition?
I don’t have my phone or money.
I myself went to get to the store to get chips.
I met her on the way.
Have you seen her condition and
you are worried about the fees?
D…doctor.
Doctor, how is she?
Thank God you got her to the hospital in time.
She is out of danger.
Thank God. Can I meet her?
In a while.
She has not regained consciousness completely.
Sister Anjum will tell you. Please.
Okay fine.
Thank you.
Are you satisfied now?
Go pay the fee quickly.
Listen.
Listen.
You are Mahir’s friend, Ifrah, right?
You are Mahir’s maid, right?
Is everything fine?
I need your help.
I have to make a call, I don’t have a phone.
I don’t even remember
the phone number of anyone at home.
You must have Mahir’s number, right?
I will call him. Don’t worry.
Hello. Yes, Ifrah, how are you?
Yes, hi Mahir.
Yes, yes, I am fine.
How is grandma?
Grandma is a little unwell
She is still hospitalized. Listen to me.
Your maid, she wants to talk to you.
My maid? Who?
You talk to her.
Hello. Hello Mahir.
The hospital you got me that day,
come there quickly.
Rania, what are you doing there?
A girl fainted on the way,
I have brought her to the hospital.
I don’t have my phone or money,
I don’t even know her family.
You please come quickly.
Man. You are too much.
You are in the habit to get in trouble.
Okay fine, you have got her to the hospital.
Come home quickly.
How can I come like this?
Okay fine, then don’t come. Suffer. I am busy,
I am going to the university. Bye.
Mahir. Mahir.
Such cruel and stonehearted
people exist in this world, man.
What happened? Is he not coming?
No.
He is really selfish.
He is not selfish, you are really sensitive.
You don’t even know that girl.
No.
You are not related to her
and you are still so worried for her.
She is nothing to me,
but she must be someone’s sister or daughter.
Just like I am dear for my mother,
the same way she too
must be dear for her mother.
Congratulations,
your patient regained consciousness.
Thank God. Can I meet her?
Yes, you can meet her,
but first let us shift her to the room
Yes, don’t talk to her for too long.
How will this poor thing talk to her for long?
She doesn’t know her.
She got her here out of humanity.
Really?
She was worried like she is really dear to her.
Okay, I will just come.
Give me this bill.
I will pay it.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It is okay.
Excuse me.
How are you?
You are fine, now, right?
I am fine. who are you?
I am the one who got you to the hospital.
okay, you go one thing,
give me the number of your family,
I will call them and ask them to come.
I don’t remember anyone’s number at home.
You please, call my mama or brother.
Okay. Okay. Don’t worry.
I will do something.
You try to remember it comfortably,
you will remember something.
Anything. You tell me,
do you live near to where you fell?
Yes, I live in that area.
Hey, I too live in that area.
Can you tell me a landmark of your home?
My home is in lane 2,
the gate colour is brown,
and the neighbours is black.
Is a carriage without a horse
parked outside your home?
Yes. Yes.
Your brother’s name is Farhad?
Yes, yes, you please call brother Farhad.
What happened?
Child, how are you now?
Rania, what happened to her?
How is the child, now?
She is fine, and you know who she is?
She is your neighbours.
These people in the city are so weird,
so unaware of people around them.
What? This child is our neighbour?
Yes, now that you have come,
go call mama and tell her to give a message
to Farhad that his sister is in the hospital.
I will. I will. Child, don’t worry,
I am informing at your home. Okay?
Yes, he is calling.
All of them will come just now.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Come on, go out. she needs to rest.
Oh, right now, don’t worry, rest.
Your family must be on the way.
Okay? I am outside.
Child, are you fine now?
Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes, grandma, I have reached.
You tell uncle to go and inform them.
Fine. No, nothing to worry about.
No, Rania is also here.
Okay.
I have told them, nothing to worry about.
Did you not have a class?
I did, but I suddenly remembered that
if you get involved with the police and court,
then who will have to run around?
Me.
That is why I left my class
and came here for you.
I have informed her family,
those people will come soon.
Let’s go.
No, no, I am not going anywhere,
till her family comes.
I cannot leave her alone and go like this.
Fine. Let’s stay here then.
See, you have come after her.
You couldn’t resist.
I had told you, I understand everything.
It is the matter of the heart.
Matter of the heart?
These people,
I don’t know what they would think.
I don’t know how long
we will have to stand guard for her.
Oh hey, hello.
What is the scene?
We informed her family a long time back,
till now no one came asking for her.
How long do we have to wait?
They don’t give helicopters on rent.
We informed them thirty minutes back,
those poor people cannot come flying.
If you want go somewhere,
then you can go.
if you are here because of me,
then don’t wait. I will come myself.
Hello.
Keep your advice to yourself.
I know you.
If I leave you at any corner of the world,
you will come back.
I am sitting here, not because of you,
I care about grandma,
that is why I am waiting.
Then do this favour to grandma too,
no need to say anything to me.
Look, you…
Hi Mahir.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
How is your patient?
She is fine.
I have to thank you again.
Had you not been there,
that poor thing wouldn’t have been treated.
Thank you.
Man, don’t embarrass me and
Mahir how did you come?
You had said you won’t come.
I didn’t have to come.
But I am out of mind that
I came here when she asked me.
I have not even had a cup of tea since morning,
I am hungry, guarding this girl.
I don’t know when her family will come.
You have got such a good maid.
She is so caring,
she has such a good heart.
You don’t get such servants nowadays.
What is your name?
My name.
You ask him for my name.
Now I don’t know
what he would like to name me.
So what name did you decide for me, Mahir?
What do you mean?
Ifrah, actually, man,
that day…
she is not my maid, she is my cousin.
Distant.
Distant cousin.
You spoke such a big lie to us, Mahir.
I am sorry. But why?
Hey, man…
Because he feels that if makes a simple girl
who wears simple clothes his relative,
then his respect will be reduced.
People will look down on him.
His own friends.
And then his name and position will get affected.
And it is possible he will stop getting proposals.
Yuck. Is this how you think?
And what proposals are you getting?
Hey, what is wrong with you?
Who are you listening to?
Yes, this is how he thinks.
He feels that a person doesn’t have respect,
his money, wealth and property have respect.
Quiet. You be quiet.
Don’t you see the environment?
We are in the hospital.
You don’t see the place, and you start.
I start? And what about you
murmuring for so long?
If this was not a hospital and our home,
then I would have showed you stars in the day.
Hello, keep these stars in your pocket.
If I lose my mind, it won’t be good.
Here. Mama, come here.
Rania, how is my sister?
Yes, she is fine now. She is out of danger.
Thank God.
Farhad, take me to my daughter.
Yes.
I will take you.
I have made good contacts in the hospital
in this time, no one will stop us.
Child, is my Laiba fine?
Has she regained consciousness?
Yes. Yes, she is conscious.
But you people thank God,
you got out of a big trouble.
Give charity aunty.
Thank God.
Child, thank you so much,
or else who helps others nowadays.
No matter if anyone does it or not, I do it.
If a person doesn’t help another,
how will the problems be solved?
Come on, I will take you. the room is there.
come on. Come on.
Hey, what?
What? Why are you going inside with them?
Let me make them,
you are not missing your train.
Now you will also make them meet?
Laiba.
Laiba, child, what happened to you?
How are you now? Are you fine now?
Yes, mama, I am fine.
I don’t know how all this happened.
You know,
she is the one who got me to the hospital.
Yes, child, I cannot repay her favour.
Child, what is your name?
Oh,
the times are so bad,
neighbours know nothing about neighbours.
Hey, she is our neighbour.
Her uncle came to inform us about Laiba.
Yes, you come to our Khushalpur some time.
It seems like the walls in the home
in our village are just a formality.
The neighbours seem like family.
If someone gets pricked in someone’s home,
the whole neighbourhood reaches there.
You seem to be from a really liberal village.
Yes, a lot.
If this was our Khushalpur,
the whole hospital would have
been filled with the neighbours.
Mama, I want water.
Water?
Hey, what happened?
Why did you stop?
Please continue.
What were you saying,
the crowd of the neighbours.
Yes. From there. From there.
Yes, so …
She is right.
nowadays we consider it unimportant
to stay in touch with each other.
Mama, our neighbours are really good,
if you go to their home, you will be really happy.
You will be a fan of mama when you meet her.
When Laiba comes home from the hospital,
I will surely go to meet them.
Child, you didn’t tell me your name.
your name?
I have a good name.
You will really like it. Rania.
Rania Ahmed.
My Mian Jee named me. it so good right?
Rania, your name is really beautiful.
Child, I will go to thank your mother myself.
She has brought you up so well.
Taught you to help others.
For that you will have
to come to our village, Khushalpur.
You must have seen the change in this
man’s dressing and my dressing, right? See.
Actually, I am her distant close relative.
Actually, he is your neighbour.
Greetings aunt.
Greetings son, live long.
They are great people.
Happy, educated.
Someone with a great past and future.
Aunty. Aunty, now that you are here,
you take care of her.
We were waiting for you.
We will go now. We will go. right?
Thank you so much, child. Goodbye.
I will come again tomorrow.
Yes, yes, child do come.
In fact, if you want,
I will send food with Mahir…
Okay, aunty. Okay.
Okay child, take care of yourself.
Okay aunty. Thank you. Okay, goodbye.
Sister we have happy looking poor
people living in our neighbourhood.
Think about it.
Why did you pull me?
Could you not have waited
for two minutes? I was talking.
I know what you were talking about.
You wanted to stay there,
and people praise you and you enjoy that.
Hah, I don’t need to do that at all.
People praise me just like that.
I was just telling Farhad’s mother not to worry, I will…
I will clean their home.
In fact, I will clean it completely, right?
Don’t say this again.
Once I get angry,
I don’t care where I am.
I was telling them that
I would send them food.
Oh, you have made me hungry
further by mentioning food.
I have been hungry for so long, anyway.
It is really late, I had no idea.
Even I am really hungry.
I was mad.
I was asking you to come
along for so long, but no.
So what? It is our city,
we have a car, we will go now.
Fine, first let’s eat something then we will go home.
What will you feed me?
I will see when we go forward.
We will have restaurant,
salad or steak, we will see.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
What happened? What happened?
Chaudary Dhaba,
famous lentils from Khushalpur,
we will have this now.
Are you in your senses?
Do you see how bad the place is,
the food will be so bad.
Let’s go forward,
we will eat at a good restaurant.
Don’t say that about food.
If we eat here, we won’t die and I will eat here.
Please Rania, what are you doing?
Stop. Come sit in the car. Rania.
This girl is mad. Rania.
Listen to me?
Are you mad?
Where have you gotten off?
Get up and sit in the car right now, hey,
we will get something on the way. Come on.
Nothing happens, come on sit here.
We will get really good food here.
If someone recognizes me, I will get insulted.
Oh, brother.
Greetings.
Greetings. Okay listen,
get two plates of your special butter lentils,
one chicken karahi, lets also get a chicken tikka,
three chapatis and two oiled flat breads. Okay?
Hey, stop, stop, stop. What are you doing?
Are you ordering for the whole village?
Brother, what is the sweet dish?
Gulab Jamun.
Gulab Jamun? That’s it?
Okay then get the gulab jamuns too. Okay?
Listen, two cup hot cardamom tea, with cream.
Bring it quickly. I am really hungry.
Why did you order so much?
Who will have four flat breads.
When the food is served,
then it won’t be left. You will see.
It is really delicious.
We also get this in our area.
What if I get an upset stomach.
Where are the children?
Hamad call them.
Oh mama, they have gone to the hospital,
it takes time. They will come.
I don’t understand anything.
Mahir went to the university,
and Rania had gone to the corner shop
to get chips for the children.
You are right mama,
but we will find out when they come.
Let them come.
I was thinking I will also go see
the neighbours’ girl at the hospital.
Oh my, why will you go mama?
Me and Hamad will go.
What do you say Hamad?
If we get time we will go.
Come on. Come on.
Do you hear your lazy son? If we get time.
He talks like he is the busiest man in the world.
What does he do?
No, today, you tell mama and me
that what secret missions you go to.
God knows what sin I committed
that I got married to this lazy person.
Do you hear that? Do you hear that?
I get insulted because of you so much. Huh?
Stop it. Stop it. I will get you hired at a factory
that too on a double shift, then don’t cry.
This is the solution for him. Huh?
He doesn’t even move
and drink water. Huh?
Tell me. When he does double shifts,
he will learn his lesson.
Hey, no mama,
how dare I that I don’t listen to my wife.
We will go to the hospital.
For sure. Absolutely.
That’s better for you.
I really enjoyed it. It was so much fun.
What are you doing, man?
What sort of language are you using?
We have people around us.
What will they think about us?
They won’t think anything.
The thing is people of
my class don’t think so much.
Your respect won’t be on the line.
Talk slowly.
Do you have a loud speaker in your mouth?
Wow. It is so much fun.
The food was so good and
the tea at the dhabba is different.
Can we go now?
Or do you want to eat food for
two to three hundred more people?
Let me finish my tea.
Don’t order butter milk after tea.
Good idea.
Mama, I am tired of eating this,
now serve food, I am really hungry.
Listen, let the children come.
Hey, Rabail.
Yes?
Where is saman?
Take care of her.
She sits in the corner as
the queen of emotions all the time.
Can someone see her and say that
she is the granddaughter of a lion heart grandma like me?,
Huh? But Rania takes up after me.
Really mama, Rania is a great girl,
she is a pretty girl.
God be kind, the children are
still not home. God be kind.
Mama, why do you worry?
they will come in a while.
Pass this nimco to me.
Here you go.
Shehansha, also have this.
Thank you.
Oh I ate so much,
I am really sleepy, I don’t feel like driving.
I told you to teach me driving for this day.
If you had taught me today, then I would have driven
and you would have slept peacefully.
But no.
Okay listen.
Go ahead.
Teach me driving from tomorrow,
I will learn fast.
Me?
I teach you driving?
Isn’t it better that I pray today and pray to God,
that after today I never get your company.
You know it is a different class
of people who sit with other people
and improve their behaviour like them.
Me being with you has made
no difference to you.
Good people.
Today is a damned day.
You made me spend half my money at the hospital
and you spent the remaining eating the food
for these two to three hundred people.
I will check.
Thank God, I have money for petrol.
Yes, don’t cry.
I will give back the money I took.
Rich for no reason.
I am losing my mind, Rania!
Be quiet and sit.
If you say a word, I will drop you off here.
You are talking continuously.
Really?
What is she doing?
What are you doing?
Why are you ruining my respect?
Now go home without me,
I am sitting here.
I will tell you this that I don’t have any
money to get a cab and come home.
Hey, talk slowly.
Do you have a loud speaker in your mouth?
People are looking,
I am being made a joke out of.
Sit quietly in the car. Sit.
You were really threatening me earlier.
If you don’t sit in the car now,
I will lift you up and throw you in the car.
Really? Come on, lift me and throw me.
if you have the courage then pick me up.
Talk slowly.
Okay listen to me,
I have a really bad headache.
Please have mercy on my condition,
sit in the car.
Please.
Hey, for the sake of your Hoshyar, Khushalpur.
Hey, for the sake of your Mian Jee,
sit in the car, please. Please.
I have to become the prime minister,
and once I sit in protest no damned
person can make me get up.
But the person whose sake you gave me
is really big, so I will have to get up.
Come on, get up.
I can get up myself.
No problem, she is a mental patient.
Poor mental patient. She is like that.
Hello.
Why are you yawning?
Sit alert or the driver will also fall sleepy.
Please keep your eyes open when driving.
You will die because of your mistake
and innocent me will also die.
And right now, I don’t plan on dying.
I have a lot of work to do.
Greetings boss.
Take the flowers.
What will I do with these flowers?
Go forward.
Sir get it for your wife.
What wife? Who is my wife?
Are you in your senses?
The one sitting next to you.
She is so pretty.
First you get your eyes tested
and leave from here.
I have lost my mind listening
to this nonsense since morning.
Before I take out my anger on you,
go, leave from here. Run. Run.
One minute.
Who talks to children like this?
Child, come here. Come here.
Hey, he…
Loser.
He is a little upset.
Show me, hey these are really pretty.
Give me two.
Hey, why are you getting two?
What will you do with these flowers?
I will wear them, what else will I do?
Pay him.
Give him money.
I am.
How much is it for?
Two. No in fact three hundred for one.
What? Three hundred for one?
Are these flowers made of gold?
The flowers are not made of gold,
but your wife is made of gold.
Give it for her sake.
That’s bad, children don’t watch too many films.
And when did he buy them for me out of love,
I myself forcefully got them.
Give the poor thing money.
Go.
Hey. Change. Change.
What is wrong? Miser.
It was worth fifty,
you gave him five hundred.
If this was not a signal,
I would have taught him a lesson.
Thank God today ended.
I am tired today.
You didn’t know her,
you didn’t even know the girl’s name
and we wasted today at the hospital.
You know if you ask me, today was really sad.
The poor girl reached the hospital
after the accident, but…
Buy you really enjoyed it, right?
You got praised. You got appreciated.
You gathered a lot of praises.
Why are you saying
the same thing again and again?
What do you mean?
I help people to receive praises?
And I get famous.
Exactly. You understand correct,
because this is the truth.
What times have come?
People form such misunderstandings about people.
They don’t even fear God.
Yes, so fine. What do we do now?
Do you want go inside
or stand here and lecture me.
Listen,
today was already frustrating.
Don’t go in front of grandma and complain.
She will scold me,
and right now I am in no mood to get scolded.
Greetings.
Greetings. Greetings.
Hey, you people took so long.
Oh.
How is the child now?
Thank God she is fine.
Thank God she didn’t get hurt badly.
She will be home in two to three days.
Thank God.
Sister should I serve food now?
Yes, child serve food.
The children are here, they must be hungry.
No grandma, we don’t need food.
We ate food.
Okay, have tea then.
We also had tea, leave it.
Nowadays do the hospital people
put on garlands to welcome people?
Hey, no aunt.
Mahir got these on the way.
They are good, right?
Yes.
Grandma, I am tired, I will rest for a while.
Yes, son, go and rest. You must be tired.
Hey look at that, everyone was so worried.
Mama was so worried.
We are sitting hungry waiting for you,
we are waiting and here they have also eaten,
brought garlands, put them on.
They got so busy that
they didn’t bother calling home.
Hey mama, I didn’t have my mobile
or else I would have surely called.
Okay, no problem, child. No problem.
You go and rest you must be tired.
Yes.
Tell me something.
How did you take that girl to the hospital?
Huh? And how did you know
that she was our neighbour?
I didn’t know. I helped her out of humanity.
Now you don’t only help the people you know.
What do you say mama?
This the upbringing of my family.
They too are always ready to help humanity 24/7.
You didn’t have a mobile, huh?
Then how did you call Mahir?
You must have called from the hospital.
This means, you remember Mahir’s number.
I am hungry.
Shall we serve food?
Yes, serve the food. Son, serve food,
the children ate and came, so we…
I have been saying for so long, I am hungry.
I will also go rest, mama.
Yes, child, you go and rest.
You must be tired.
I have been saying this for so long that
pack your bags and come here, but no,
Mona won’t be Mona if she listens to her sister.
Hey sister, your in-laws are not running away,
it is my beloved friend’s wedding, I won’t miss it.
Wow, even if you miss
the chance of your own marriage.
Why is it so important tell me?
If you don’t dance at the wedding then
will the wedding not be accepted.
Or tell me if the boy’s family put a condition
that she has to dance on the wedding?
Hey, you get really out in your anger.
Okay, don’t worry, I will come.
And yes, listen,
give love to Mahir from me.
Okay bye.
Listen…
Are you done?
I had asked you to serve food.
You eat food, enjoy feasts.
This is the limit.
I have been married to such a selfish,
worry free man.
Do you have no worry of the future?
Do you not worry?
IF you are worried about, then it is food.
What is it? Why are you getting upset?
Why are you taking out
someone else’s anger on me?
Hamad, listen to me. did you see?
Did you see or not? Huh?
Both of them came together.
The hospital was just an excuse,
they had food,
they had tea too and
he even bought garlands for her too.
Yes, I saw a little.
Then how can you be so satisfied?
What else can I do? After all,
it doesn’t suit me to be dissatisfied on this.
Oh man, Hamad,
tell me honesty, are you on drugs?
Everything is happening right
under your nose, don’t you see it.
I don’t understand,
I have this useless man here,
and on the other her,
who can miss every chance of her marriage,
but she will dance on her best friend’s wedding.
Where am I stuck?
Okay do one thing,
you stay stuck, I will eat myself.
Check out her cunningness.
She left with the excuse to get chips and biscuits,
he left with the university as an excuse, huh?
Then both of them met.
You can do what you want, Mahir.
Son, you will get married to Mona,
or else my name won’t be Seema.
Shehanshah, chop it thin,
you chop the chili really thick.
Mama, you go and sit,
the breakfast will be ready in ten minutes.
I was thinking child, Rania,
that the neighbours
we have their mother and
daughter are at the hospital,
so why don’t we send something
for them from here.
Oh, it slipped my mind.
Poor Farhad and his uncle will be alone at home.
Yes.
Let’s invite them here instead of sending something.
Best.
That’s better.
Son, Shehansha,
you go and tell the neighbours
that till the time your child and
their mother is at the hospital, they eat here.
Listen, if they say no as a formality,
don’t come back with that face.
Bring them over.
Now I cannot bring them forcefully.
They are such big men, how will I lift them?
I will come with you.
Mama, don’t worry,
I will come back with them. Come on.
Sister will you lift them up?
Me saying it is enough.
I talk sweetly. Come on, now.
Go, I will come after drinking juice.
Your stomach is never full.
You will drink juice and go.
Shehansha come quickly now.
Oh man, there is so much place,
but no, you have to collide with me.
You roam around the home like a bull.
Hey, hey, easy, I didn’t bump into you,
you bumped into me. Stupid girl.
Who did you call stupid? Huh?
Who did you call stupid?
I don’t have time right now
that is why I am not responding.
When I get time,
I will tell you who is stupid.
Shehansha,
come on,
we don’t have time for useless talk.
She hurt my ear.
I don’t know from
where she takes out that sound.
She is a really good girl.
Will I get breakfast in this home?
Hey wait, we have guests coming over.
Hey, now who else is coming to this home?
Listen, the neighbours, I have told them that till
the time that girl and her mother are in the hospital,
they should come and eat at our home.
Very good.
You feed them breakfast,
I am heading to the university.
Where are you going?
Eat and go. have breakfast and go.
Don’t you dare leave without eating.
I will have breakfast comfortably
in the university cafeteria.
You feed breakfast to your
neighbours and their neighbours.
Oh God, he never listen to me.
Come on. Come on.
Don’t be shy. Come quickly.
Uncle she is right.
Consider it your home, don’t be shy.
I am not mad that
I consider a strangers home my own.
Rabail. Rabail, see who is here.
Greetings.

Uncle, put your hand on her hand,
wish her well.
Child, I admit that
I am unluckily your uncle by relation,
but I am not that old in age that I can put a
hand on a girl’s head and wish her well.
Don’t make me do these cheap things,
understand?
You people come, I will serve breakfast.
Come on Shehansha.
Go. Go. Go.
Oh, did you see uncle,
she is such a decent,
well trained and friendly girl. He, that sells.
Nephew you are making me count
the qualities of the girl
like you are the aunt
who gets weddings done.
Son, stop throwing your
number outside girl colleges.
Stop these cheap actions.
Okay? Understand?
I will introduce you people to mama.
She will be really happy to meet you.
Come on uncle.
I am not your uncle.
Control.
I mean, I am not your uncle.
I am his uncle. Shall we go?
Yes, come on.
Why is she calling me uncle?
Come on.
So what else do you people do apart
from getting ready in the morning?
By the way.
My uncle likes joking around. Control.
Okay.
Have some.
We came to thank you,
you people arranged so much.
You have made us even more thankful.
This is nothing.
We make even more
arrangements than this daily.
Today our chef is on leaves,
so we kept it at a minimal.
We have a rich family,
so our table is always full.
Go ahead, have some.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Very good.
A lot of arrangement has been made.
Curry, flat bread, sandwich, butter milk, is it Eid
or I have come to someone else’s home.
I see my own wife.
Hamad, these are our neighbours.
Greetings brother.
Greetings. How are you?
Greetings.
Greetings.
So you came alone?
Didn’t your family come. I mean, your wife?
Actually, my uncle is single, he is still looking.
Actually, I haven’t met my soul mate till now.
The curry must be getting cold.
Serve it. Serve it.
Pass me the spoon.
