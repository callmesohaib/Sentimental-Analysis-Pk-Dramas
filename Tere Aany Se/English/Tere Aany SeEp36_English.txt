I would say Rania’s father made a good
decision by not giving his sister’s proposal to Mr. Ayaz.
Hey do these poor people have a life?
Hey, I want the government
to ban the marriages of poor.
Hey, this a game of rich people.
Rich people only.
Hello. Hey wow,
today brother Khaver is also here.
What is this?
You still are not worried?
I feel someone hasn’t taught you a lesson.
No problem, I am here, I will remind you
that you have come to your future in-laws.
May God get your marriage sorted soon,
I have to take revenge from you for everything.
Okay, I have a really good news.
My Mian Jee he can come into action like a hero of a film
and he has fixed the proposal of uncle and Bebo.
What? Really?
Do you hear that Khaver?
Now I will need a new
dress on every event and yes,
Mahir and Honey’s proposal
is also going to get fixed.
We will have more functions, so more clothes.
I will dress up well in every function.
What? What are you saying?
I mean, Honey is aunt Sweetie’s relative,
so how can Mahir agree?
Hey, I don’t have the answer
for all these questions.
But both of them are well set,
and on top of that Mahir
will not let go of such a rich proposal.
Yes, this is what smart people do.
send Mahir, I will congratulate him a little.
Hey, no, no, not right now.
We will congratulate him on the day of the engagement.
Where are you going, Rania?
Don’t you have to give everyone
the news of Bebo’s proposal?
I told you, you tell everyone.
Rania.
I will immediately take Honey’s side.
I have to take revenge from this damned Mahir.
He has messed with a lot,
and I will mess with him double.
Hey, be quiet.
No one knows about this right now,
brother Hammad has told me not to tell anyone.
Hey I don’t understand your brother Hammad.
What is happening to me?
I know it well that he doesn’t love me,
so will I ruin my respect?
I will plead for the sake of my love,
I will request him to have mercy on me,
he should sympathize with me,
he should marry me?
Damn you, Rania.
You can live your life without love,
but living without respect is
no less than a punishment.
And I will never express my love and
give him a chance to laugh at me.
After all, I have to go ahead.
I have to become the prime minister of the country.
What?
Really?
Meaning, her aunty has fixed
my proposal without asking me.
Why? Who is she?
Hey, if she fixes my proposal with the girl I like,
then I will say no to it in my stubbornness.
She thinks so highly of herself.
Okay, so I am not the girl you like?
And you are saying this to my face?
Have shame. Say sorry.
Sorry. Sorry, but I didn’t mean that.
Man, your aunty, she has made me face a lot of loss,
and I am not going to be fooled by any of her conspiracy.
Meaning, I am so bad?
No, Honey, it is not that.
You are not the one I like.
So who is the one you like?
Yes so we too should know
who brother Mahir likes.
Man, the one I like,
right now she has gone far away from me
and the reason for that too is your aunty.
She left me nowhere.
Poor aunt Sweetie has no fault,
you are the one who left the battle field and went.
But I understand well that you like Rania.
We understand this,
but still you are not ready to admit it.
You know, today Rania came
and she came so happy,
but when she found out that you and
Honey’s proposal has been fixed, she went pale.
She went back as sad as she came happy.
I stopped her a lot, but she didn’t stop. She left.
She must have gotten upset on something else,
you have a misunderstanding.
Hey, I am not stupid like you.
Just like I know the secret of your heart,
just like that I know what is going on in Rania’s head.
Honey is right.
Come on, get up, take out the car,
we will go to Rania’s place right now.
What for? Tell me as well, after all,
I broke this news. What happened?
Brother, get up.
Sir, this is the file with the bills.
You always bring bills.
Madam, tea.
Rania, why are you so sad?
Now Mian Jee has convinced your father,
for Ayaz. And Bebo too is really happy.
I am also happy.
Uncle Ayaz is a good man,
he will really keep Bebo happy.
Sorry, if you are happy then
why don’t I see this happiness on your face?
I…
Bebo will go far from us, that’s why.
I have heard that girls become
strangers after marriage.
By the way Rania,
what did you think about yourself?
What do you mean?
Meaning, will you get married by your
liking or by the decision of your family?
Marriage is not my priority,
I have to do many other big things.
After all,
I don’t like anyone,
so when the time comes
I will accept the decision of the elders.
Really? Honestly?
Yes, I wont get an award lying to you.
after all, my Mian Jee can never
make a wrong decision for me.
Madam Rania, madam is calling you.
Okay, I will come.
You people have tea, I will come.
Doctor, you worry for no reason,
the girl agrees and the girl’s father
he wont have any objection.
Here, have my tea in this happiness.
No, what are you doing…
Rania is okay.
Sister, this Mian Jee and sister in law
are constantly staring at me.
They are looking at me from every angle.
Do I look like a sight to them?
There is nothing like that, sit quietly.
Actually, the thing is,
I was talking to the child.
I have a nephew,
we were talking about a girl for him.
I went to the girl’s home.
So I entered the girl’s home
and my feet stopped there.
Sir, I think the water for the tea is boiling.
I will go check on the tea myself instead of they see it.
I will make first class tea with sweets.
I will come in two minutes.
You will ask why?
Yes, so Mian Jee, you were telling me that
your feet refused to move forward.
Very interesting. Very interesting.
The thing is I knew this doctor from earlier.
Really?
He was a man from our area, he was a registrar,
and he used to take bribes.
Oh.
So I thought that his grandfather is like that
and the affect will be in the kids.
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
You don’t have any such
grandfather in your relatives, right?
It is possible.
Then forget about it.
This secret shouldn’t be told to anyone.
I forgot it. Forgot it.
Yes, Mian Jee, you made the right decision.
You did the right thing,
blood shows its colours one day.
Are you okay?
You look worried.
I am worried.
You know Mahir is in great difficulty.
Rania, don’t you feel that
you are extra conscious for Mahir.
I mean, you think about him a lot,
but he never takes you that seriously, I think.
How he is and how he isn’t with me,
is my issue with him.
Anyway, right now,
Mahir will be in a big trouble.
You know his stepmother,
she wants to fix her adopted
daughter’s proposal with Mahir forcefully.
His life will be ruined.
Rania,
is Mahir a western girl,
tied up in chains of helplessness?
He is a man and he can decide for himself.
He knows what is good or bad.
If he wants to get married or not,
he will decide about this,
why are you worried about this for no reason?
Hey, I am worrying for no reason?
Yes.
He is my cousin.
When I can think for the good of every person,
then I will surely think for him.
Do you want something?
Yes, the children in
the hospital really miss you.
Hey, the boy doesn’t know that
girls bring these trolleys and trays.
He is an eastern boy.
Yes, eastern.
Yes.
Yes, yes,
it is the first time, so he is really excited.
Son, what other work do you do?
Sir, I can make round flat bread,
I can also take out the scarfs that
get stuck in the chains of motorcycles.
Sir, I can connect the wire of the cable.
Ayaz,
I was telling them that,
he is really cooperative.
He helps me with all the work
and he does all the work outside,
he doesn’t do the work at home.
He does all the work outside.
You shouldn’t be that cooperative.
Hey son, what is there to worry about.
I am the girl’s father,
I am not the arguing aunt of the girl
that I will take out flaws in you
and end the proposal there.
No, you know what it was.
Breaking news, the proposal has been fixed.
We just need to fix the date, why do you worry?
Congratulations. Congratulations.
I will go get sweets, sir.
He is feeling shy.
I just don’t understand you Mahir.
You say anything to anyone’s face.
You are really outspoken.
But Rania, who is a sweet girl,
you cannot say to her that you love her?
Rania is a smart girl.
It is not that he will say I love you and
she will accept it considering it her good luck.
She won’t accept this love so easily.
So how will she accept it?
You people are really complicated.
You don’t know Honey,
these two have fought a lot.
and their diplomatic relations
have also stayed really bad.
And Rania doesn’t have
a good opinion about our friend.
But this mister didn’t think of it then that he will;
love the same girl in future. Now suffer.
Yes, so I am suffering,
what else am I doing?
Whatever was left,
Honey, your aunt has completed that.
She has put claims on my property.
How do I go to Rania’s father
to ask for her proposal?
I am poor, I have nothing.
Now do I go to Rania’s millionaire father with this face?
As a poor man? Hey, my life is ruined.
Fine, then sit and cry, don’t do anything.
Man, I cannot do anything in this issue.
At least you people help me out.
Can you people not find
the solution for such a small problem?
Mahir, it is such a small issue and you were saying that
you have made a room in Rania’s Mian Jee’s heart.
Yes, so should I marry Mian Jee?
Look at you talk.
Hey, I should make room in
the heart of the person I want to marry.
Now this is something difficult.
Hey, you stay quiet.
The situation is already really tense and
you start your commentary in the middle.
Salik, I am going home.
And I will go meet Rania,
and I will talk to Rania for Mahir myself.
Honey, I will come with you,
the two of us will talk to Rania together
because now brother won’t be able to do anything.
Hey, he is a good boy, I swear.
Honestly, so decent, so sober, respecting.
I am surprised at the generation of today.
and uncle, he was also really well trained.
He served the tea himself.
Yes, for this I have given him extra numbers.
He got tea himself as well.
Zaman, we don’t have to delay,
I have thought that we fix a date for
the first week of next month for the wedding.
Now it is your job to fix
what the exact date will be.
No Mian Jee, how dare I?
if you have fixed everything,
then also fix the date too.
I just wanted to say that look around yourself too.
We have a good sober, well settled boy around us.
I wanted to fix Rania’s proposal with her.
Rania’s proposal?
Are you talking about Dr. Wasiq?
Uncle, he is a good boy, I really like him.
Then what do you say, Mian Jee?
Yes, but I mean,
he has a different temperament.
I mean he is serious type.
This is his quality, Mian Jee,
you cannot call it his weakness.
And when do we want to make
Rania’s husband do standup comedy?
There is an age difference, but anyway,
there is no need to be hasty in this.
Look, you are Rania’s father,
but I am the father’s father.
I am well aware of her.
Whatever decision I make will be better for her.
You wait for this a little.
Fine, Mian Jee as you see fit.
Greetings mama. How are you?
Greetings.
Mama, it has been long,
I have not seen Mahir. Where is he?
Where is Mahir?
Your wife dragged him out of the home,
that poor thing doesn’t want to come home.
Mama, that is why I am saying,
do you remember even that
day I had spoken to you
that we should fix the proposal
between Mahir and Honey.
Everything will be in Mahir’s control,
I am telling you.
look I am his father,
I will not make a wrong decision.
You just say yes, I would say.
I am not the one who will say ‘I accept’,
‘I accept’, when he won’t agree, what do I do?
Mama.
Yes?
It was time for your tea, so I got it made.
Look at that, my love, live long, live long.
Child why did you get into this formality,
Seema and Rabail would have brought it. You are our guest.
Sit my child.
You drink it and tell me how it is.
I make really good tea. Will you have it?
Then it must be good.
No. No, child.
Right now I am sweet talking mama right now.
I will have sweet tea later.
Great tea child. Thank you child.
Right mama, she made good tea.
She is a really good girl,
she is happy and jolly.
I would say mama,
such girls are hard to find in today’s time.
Mahir and Honey’s pair will look good together.
You ask him once, it is possible
he doesn’t have an objection on this.
What do you say?
Should we ask about the proposal?
There is no issue in that.
There is no issue. Yes. I will ask him.
Enjoy your tea, mama.
What are you people planning to do with me?
Hey, you are good friends with Mahir
and just like it happens in the films,
this friendship will also change into love.
Aunty, please be quiet.
Do you think my life is a joke?
Child, if you don’t find a husband
that is subdued by you,
then life becomes a joke,
and that too such a joke that
you always cry on instead of laughing.
I don’t understand, aunty.
You don’t like Mahir, nor his family, then why do you
want me to get married in the people you don’t like?
Politics, child. You call this politics.
Just like Dabeer is an obedient husband,
I feel Mahir too will turn out to be an obedient husband.
And you don’t find this class of men in America.
Just like I rule my husband,
I want that you too rule your husband the same way.
Just let these desis come to America,
then you will see how they become our slave.
Aunty.
Oh, Mahir.
Hello. Yes, Honey, go ahead.
Mahir come home immediately.
Why? what hell has broken loose?
Will you only come when hell breaks loose?
Honey, right now I am at Salik’s home,
and I am going to do
something important with him.
I cannot come right now.
Okay tell me, where are you going?
I will come there.
What is the thing?
What is the emergency, tell me at least.
I will come and tell you, tell me,
where are you going?
I am going to hell.
Will you come to meet me?
You won’t tell me, right?
Fine. I will call Salik and ask him.
Hi. Salik, where is Mahir going?
By the way while shopping you look so innocent,
so cute…how many kurtis did you get till now?
These are not kurtis, these are dresses.
You deserve dresses.
You get them.
They will look good on you.
This one is so pretty.
Oh wow, the color will look good.
Get two of these.
My salary is fifty thousand.
Fifty thousand.
Are you sure?
Yes.
This is a little dark.
But it will look good on you.
the time for black will
never go out of fashion. Great.
This one is also good.
This is a pair, right?
Fifty thousand?
This place has almost fifty thousand varieties.
I think that one is more in. come on.
What is the problem?
You people had to shop,
you people got me along for no reason.
Do you people see her?
Do you hear her talk?
Are you not happy in my happiness?
I used to think you would be
the most excited on my marriage.
And look at your attitude.
Okay, why are you getting upset?
I have a bad headache.
Then why didn’t you tell me earlier?
I will get you tea from here, this will fix your headache
and till then your shopping will be done as well.
I don’t want to have tea.
Come on, please.
Hey, he is insisting so much, then go ahead.
You will have a headache for no reason
and you will stand here with that face.
Have tea, you will go in the open air,
we too will spend some time together,
we will shop. You too shop.
Come on, please.
Okay, then please do me
a favour and come soon.
We will come really soon.
You take care of Rania.
Yes, sure, you please continue.
I think we should go to the Friday market,
because things are coming there from the entire
world and maybe you will like the variety?
Shall we go?
It is right here. Come on.
Man, this pair of jeans looks so good.
Salik, if you want to shop, then go ahead,
I have to talk to Mahir about something important.
What are you saying Honey?
If I wanted to shop alone,
why would I have brought him along?
Consider the seriousness of the situation.
It will take ten minutes.
Just ten minutes.
I will really bring Mahir back.
Hey…
Hey, I will get bored here alone.
Hey Honey, where are you taking me?
I am telling you. you didn’t even
listen to me properly on the phone.
I don’t know what you want
to talk about? At least tell me.
We will sit and talk.
Come from here, I cannot sit here.
Why? Why? Why? Why?
What happened?
Those two live in the same home,
can they not leave together for some work?
They cannot.
Honey this is not America,
this is Pakistan and all this doesn’t happen here.
Hi.
Hi. How are you people?
You are together,
so you must be happy and satisfied,
or else why is anyone with someone.
You are right,
no one goes around
with anyone without a reason.
Can we join you people?
Hey, when will you enjoy our company?
Look at Mr. Mahir’s face,
he has got a bad temper just hearing this.
You people sit, have a seat,
enjoy each other’s company.
We were about to go.
we had to shop a little.
Shall we go Dr. Wasiq?
The tea?
I will get that for you from a good place.
From a tea stall. We will go.
Bye.
Mahir, you are stupid.
We got such a good chance, but you…
What chance? You…
You are useless.
Shall we sit now?
Mahir.
Rania, we had to have tea.
I didn’t want to have it,
it was your advice.
But what happened suddenly?
I had told you earlier my head hurts,
I want to go back home.
Fine. I agree, but listen to me.
I told you I don’t want to hear anything,
I want to go back home right now.
Rania, how will you go alone?
For your information,
I came to your city from my village, alone.
So can I not go home alone?
Okay fine, I will drop you. You…
There is no need for that.
Will you live with me all your life? No, right?
After all, I am used to doing my own work,
I can go, you check on Beno.
Hey doctor, how are you?
Greetings.
Who else will I meet here?
I mean, you are here, I met Mahir
and whoever she was on the top floor.
Yes. Yes. I have come with Mahir and Honey.
Then you should have stayed with them,
you have worried people.
What do you mean?
No, nothing. That…
You were buying something, right?
Hey Honey,
leave me I don’t want to come.
I don’t know what issue this Salik has,
why he dropped me here and left?
Salik dropped you here
so that you listen to me calmly. But you…
I don’t want to go…
Oh my son is here.
I am so happy prince.
Honey, I knew you will bring him here.
You naughty boy,
I knew you would never say no to Honey.
Oh Honey, you two look
so good standing together.
Honey, you?
You conspired with your mother
and got me here…
Honey, I didn’t expect this from you
and you also involved Salik with you.
There is nothing like that, Mahir, trust me.
Stop it, man. I will not stay here
even for a moment. I am going.
No. No. No.
Leave me.
Where are you going? Please come,
it is your own home, you will live here now.
Leave me.
Mahir, listen to me, your mother in law is right,
I mean your future mother in law.
Hey look you are mama’s beloved,
you are the light of this home.
Now your wedding is getting fixed,
at least help with the arrangements.
Wedding is getting fixed.
Why are you joking with me?
I am not joking, you know just between us,
you two don’t look good together.
Mahir, no.
Mahir. Mahir.
Okay good, he came inside.
Brother Anwaar has fixed the engagement
date for Asma and Ayaz’s engagement.
So I was thinking…
You are thinking right mama,
lets fix Mahir and Honey’s proposal too.
Absolutely right.
Grandma, what is going on behind
my back in this home?
What conspiracy is being created against me?
What conspiracy son?
What are you saying?
Okay,
the boy has been informed and
this news has fallen on the child as lightening.
Now we will see on who all does
this boy falls on as lightening.
Everyone hear one thing clearly,
no one can force me.
Hey son, what are you saying?
We won’t make a wrong decision for you.
After all, I am your father, man.
I know but before being my father,
you are her husband too.
What are you saying?
Hey, you are good friends with Honey,
no we said it, you are getting angry.
So dad, you are making me angry.
I am telling you,
I will not come in under anyone’s pressure.
It is a clear no from me for this proposal.
Hey, hey, look son, don’t be emotional.
Calm down. Calm down.
Go inside the room,
lie down, have cold water.
Think with a cool mind.
The decision we are making is
right in your favour, it is not wrong.
Tell him Honey how good you are,
what good of a child are you?
I will tell him, uncle. I think Mahir is feeling shy,
give him some time, don’t get angry.
What are you saying?
By the way Honey, on such occasions,
the future bride gets shy in our home.
They must feel shy, but the thing is,
I don’t know how to feel shy.
The child is right,
the country she has come from there,
there is no shame.
I request all of you to give Mahir some time.
Mahir will not disappoint you at all.
Mahir, go to the lawn,
take deep breaths, relax,
you are lucky that I came in your life,
your fate has been awakened.
What fate? What?
Go. Go.
I don’t know what she is talking about.
Now we will not talk about this topic again.
Honey, what are you saying?
I don’t understand.
Nothing against Mahir’s will, will happen.
This means that this marriage will not take place.
Huh?
To hell with this drama on TV,
the real drama is taking place in this home.
You don’t care.
