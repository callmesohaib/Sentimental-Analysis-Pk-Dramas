Son, call your father.
It has been a few days that
he didn’t call, I am worried.
Hey grandma,
you don’t need to worry,
and when does papa call daily.
He must be fine.
Really?
and I also wanted to tell you something.
He is going to talk about Ifrah.
Yes, tell me what is it?
Grandma, I am going
to Murree with my friends,
I will come back in three to four days.
Okay.
Really?
Who are they?
Tell their names as well.
I am talking to my grandma,
irrelevant people should stay out of it.
Do you see mama,
how he is talking to me?
I see it.
I had told you earlier as well,
this girl is
my youngest brother’s
last family member.
So you deal with her
with love and affection.
and you will see grandma,
really soon,
this last family member will not only set fire
to this home, but also this entire city.
God forbid.
Hide it. Hide it,
as much as you can.
But the learned people have said,
love and scent doesn’t stay hidden,
no matter how much you try.
Huh? What are you saying?
It is a secret.
But swear to God,
you won’t mention it to anyone.
Is it something dangerous?
It is dangerous for me.
If Mahir finds out I leaked his secret,
God knows what he will do with me.
But you are not in danger.
Okay come on, tell me quickly.
Your beloved is in love.
He is in love? Huh?
Slowly. Slowly.
With whom?
That’s what I am spying on,
and I have full hopes that
I will be successful soon.
Hey, I cannot tell you how happy
I am to hear this news.
He always used to say that
my standard is so high
that no girl can reach that standard.
But now she likes someone,
then it means he found
a girl his standard.
But I don’t understand one thing,
why is he hiding it from anyone?
Why is he planning so secretly?
really? What planning?
Someday, some people will come
to this home with excuses.
For example, they want a home on rent,
or it is possible they will say
they want to buy a home.
They will ask you if there is any room
available in the neighbourhood.
Then what do I have to say?
Say anything.
This is just an excuse, mama.
Actually, they are coming over
to review the home and all of us.
This means, that we need
to be ready every day.
Yes, what else?
But I didn’t understand one thing.
Then ask, mama. Ask,
why am I here? Ask me. Ask.
Look, as per the rule the boy’s family
first visits the girl’s family,
but here the girl’s family is first
coming here to the boy’s family.
Yes.
It is the opposite.
I got it. I feel mama,
your grandson has got his hands
at a high place.
He has trapped a pretty and
delicate temperament girl.
What?
The girl I feel has surely put a condition
that till the time she doesn’t like
the family along with the boy,
she will not say yes.
Right?
That’s how it must be.
You know the girls nowadays
have a lot of tantrums.
Fine then, let’s prepare...
You have to wear good and expensive
dresses like this daily
and wear these earrings etc.
After all, you are the boy’s grandmother,
right?
Yes, that I am.
Hello. Hello.
Oh hello dad, greetings.
How are you?
You must be fine.
Yes, son, you are right.
Only humans get unwell,
I am not human.
I am a robot.
Have robots ever gotten unwell?
Tell me,
are all the humans there fine?
Hey dad, you get emotional
on everything.
Who do you take up after?
All of us here are really practical.
I forgot to tell you the most important thing.
Okay dad, I am going
to Murree with my friends.
It is snowing there,
to see that.
Hey son, is snowfall even a thing to see?
Here, you have knee height snow
here all the time.
We are tired of seeing it.
You are going to see snowfall.
By the way,
son as far as I can remember,
there are a lot of monkeys there,
people go there to see monkeys.
If you have to go see monkeys then go.
Yes, yes, I will also see that dad.
But I am going there,
but I cannot go.
Why are you talking like a monkey?
You just said that you are going.
Did you join politics?
You always change your statements.
Idiot.
Dad, it is not that.
It is really cold in Murree,
for that dad, you need
a lot of warm clothes.
I don’t have money to buy warm clothes.
What?
You don’t have money?
You don’t have money.
Hey, what do you people
do with the dollars?
Do you make paper boats with it
and sail them over water?
Or do you put them at the fire place,
set them on fire and warm your hands?
Whenever you call,
you just say one thing.
We don’t have money. We don’t have money.
We don’t have money.
So you tell me,
what I should do?
The inflation has reached the skies
and the family is so big,
who have so many expenses.
Dad, you are sitting comfortably over there
and enjoying your life.
Here, who has the responsibility
of the entire home?
Poor me.
The responsibility of the whole home
is on my weak shoulders.
Dad, you tell me, what should I do?
You tell me, should I quit studies.
Should I quit studies,
and become a driver, or a rider?
If you tell me,
I will setup a fruit stall.
No. No. No.
My son. No.
Why will you do these small things?
To do these things, your father is alive,
he is here,
to send you the dollars.
Why will you do this my love?
Dad, don’t drag it. Tell me,
when are you going to send the money?
I will send it by tomorrow evening.
love you dad. Love you.
You are the best dad.
But listen to me.
Okay dad, the battery is low.
The battery is low.
Huh? He disconnected it and went.
Look at that, they are so selfish.
As soon as their objective is met,
they quickly say okay dad
I am going I am getting late.
Yes, we have the time.
The work is done.
The dollars will come.
Now I will enjoy the trip.
Should I keep this or not?
Can I come?
You have already come inside.
Do you want something?
I have been seeing for so long
that you are so busy,
so I thought I would help you out.
Give it to me, I will pack…
There is no need to touch anything.
Thank you.
Look, now your own help you out.
But I feel that you still haven’t added me
in the list of your own.
Correct. You feel the right thing.
It is really wrong.
Hey, you will help me,
when I will pack something and take it.
I will shop for everything new,
and all my friends will be left staring.
What difference does new clothes
make to your friends?
Hey, who shops fresh
for such a short trip?
This is something only
a spend thrift like me can do.
Who has a big pocket, a big heart,
he has more respect.
Okay,
so you mean to say that
respect is increased with clothes.
Correct.
My husband has a lot of respect
in his city
and he doesn’t shop daily.
I have a total of four dresses,
but thank God,
I have a lot of respect in my city,
and after coming here, here too…
Are you done?
Is your speech over?
So you can leave.
Thank you.
Keep on sitting.
Yes, Salik. Yes. Yes.
The plan is done.
You know he is a big show off.
God have mercy on Irfah.
Why are there no signals? Oh. Oh.
Oh. Hey, mama is here
I had to go for an interview,
I forgot.
You have to do one thing,
if sister asks about my interview,
then you say that
uncle went for the interview,
it went well, it was great but right at the
last moment, someone came through contacts
and he got the job.
What will you say?
Repeat.
Meaning, you….
Oh, I am tired today.
What happened?
You came so soon, mama.
Ayaz, get me water.
Yes, sister.
Hey, when did I go to attend
a mehndi function?
It was Sarwat’s second husbands
third day of mourning,
poor thing looked really sad.
Sarwat’s husband is dead?
Sarwat’s husband is dead.
Sarwat’s husband is dead.
Hey, what do you mean?
Why do you have a glow in your eyes?
Have you forgotten,
this is the same Sarwat,
who said no to your proposal
when she was single.
She considered your salary to be low.
She married that fat businessman,
and if your memory works correctly,
then after the death of that fat businessman,
you sent a proposal and got me insulted
and even then, she rejected your proposal
and accepted the proposal of that businessman.
Now. Now, what do you want?
Such an arrogant aunty.
She ignored uncle twice.
I am telling you forget about this aunty.
There are many other girls
in the world, consider them.
Where are those girls?
Where are those girls?
Huh?
Waiting for them,
I have white hair,
my eyesight got weak,
where are those girls?
I have knee pain.
Where are those girls, sister?
I was single,
I am single, I will remain single.
Hey, God forbid,
what nonsense are you speaking?
Disappointment is a sin.
I am telling you,
you will wear a flowered veil soon.
Where is that veil?
And where are those flowers?
Where is the veil?
Sister, where is that veil?
Okay, you tell me,
you had an interview today,
how did it go?
I am crying, you tell her the tragedy.
Yes, yes, I remembered.
Actually mama,
she went for the interview,
his interview went really well,
but at the last moment someone
got the job through contacts.
That’s what you told me, right?
Sister…
Meaning, you didn’t get a job,
and instead of getting worried for this,
you are dying to get married.
Who will give their daughter
to someone jobless like you?
Sister, that is why I am saying
that if there is a widow, a divorcee,
even she would do.
What do you mean?
Will the not have to be fed?
Will she consume air?
Hey, when will you learn?
Sister, where are those billionaires,
whose husband’s die,
who gets divorced.
Why am I not getting proposals
for them? Huh?
What do we need to cook
for food today?
This jacket looks good,
how much is it for?
25000?
It is fine, it is just 100 dollars.
Mahir.
Yes, grandma.
I am thinking of getting you married.
Grandma, right now I am shopping
to go to Murree,
this marriage…
marriage?
One second,
I hope you are not thinking of getting me
married to your beloved brother’s granddaughter.
You got shocked, right?
Don’t worry, I don’t believe
in forcing relations.
After all, I will get you married
by your liking.
Thank God, grandma.
I am able to breathe again.
Why?
My blood pressure just jumped up.
Mine too.
Why yours?
Mama, there should be a match too.
My nephew is a prince, and then she..,
And then your brother’s amazing last child,
who in future will set the whole city on fire.
God forbid.
Say something good for once.
She is such a good girl,
so respecting, obedient.
Yes, yes, she is a really good girl.
But the eyes you need
to see her qualities,
we don’t have that grandma.
Right, aunt?
Yes, I agree with you people.
You don’t have that sight.
Grandma, I am thinking
I will get something for you.
there is a sale.
To hell with it.
Hey, don’t move. Don’t move.
Is it out.
Oh God, Rabail,
you have a whole colony.
Thank God I have come,
or else you would have a
whole society till now.
You know, I swear to God, she has had
lices in her hair since childhood.
God forbid, she lies so much,
even she used to get it.
Hey, don’t move.
Don’t move. One more.
Oh God, such long hair,
you also have to keep it clean.
Okay, what am I thinking?
Lets take Rania to a good place
for shopping.
Yes, good thought.
What do you say, Rania?
Will you come with us.
Yes. By the way, sister Saman.
Yes?
You don’t care about
your poor husband at all.
You don’t sympathize with him at all.
The poor thing is suffering in your love.
At times he sends his father,
he sends his brother.
He is calling you again and again.
But you don’t move an inch.
You don’t care about him one bit.
Arbab is like that.
Whenever I come to my parents’ home,
he gets sad.
Actually, he loves me a lot.
Then you should also care for his love.
Right, Rabail?
Yes, you should.
Such husbands are one in a million.
And your father in law, and that...
what is his name, Khawar?
My brother in law.
Yes.
He loves you so much
and cares for you.
But you.
you don’t care at all.
Go home, I am telling you.
Go sit at home and take care of him.
You know that is true,
I am really lucky,
when it comes to love.
I am thinking I will go soon.
I won't bother Arbab too much.
Fine, then I will also come to your home.
Hey, we will come and see all the stories
your father in law tells us,
what Taj Mahal has he built.
Oh, move. Move. Move.
What happened?
What happened?
What happened to her?
Hey, apply oil before you go, Rania.
She always does things incomplete.
She is calling me now.
Hello. Where are you lost, Salik?
I have been calling you for so long,
at least answer my call.
Okay listen, listen, listen,
all the setting is made,
the girl’s family will come to your home
with the excuse of looking for a home.
Just be careful about one thing,
for God’s sake,
don’t misbehave with them.
Yes,
this happens.
It is love.
You have to put in some
extra effort in love.
Hey, when the family doesn’t agree,
then what can a person do?
No issues. No issues,
you have to put in some effort
to get your love.
Fine. Fine. Okay listen, one important…
The bulb of my room got fused,
it was kept here.
Did you give my number to one
of your close relative?
No. For no reason? Why?
Hey, why do you come over
when I get a call?
What do you think that
I am an enemy of the state
or an agent from another country
that I am conveying a message
on the phone.
That’s what I am thinking.
It didn’t feel that way earlier,
but now I feel that way.
That is why you say secret things
on the phone.
Who were you talking to?
Hey, I am talking to Salik.
He is my friend. Do you want to talk to him?
Do you? Should I make you talk to him?
Why would I want to?
that’s what I am asking you,
why do you want to interfere
in my matters?
You know, you can trust me.
I know how to keep a secret a secret.
After all, I don’t mind anything you say,
because I know you have
a lot of pain inside you.
The pain of loneliness bothers
you day and night.
You want to cry,
but this damned manliness
comes in the way.
I didn’t know,
I am in such a bad shame.
My God.
Thank you so much you told me.
I want to feel my pain alone,
I want to cry openly.
You go from here.
Huh?
Can you please, get out.
Loneliness.
I want to cry?
Mama, fix your eyeliner.
Huh?
Yes, it is fine.
Is it fine now? Listen, call Naheed.
They said they would be back in two days,
it is three days now.
Ask where he went?
And where are his guests?
I sit daily doing makeup,
and we don’t know where they are.
Mama, what guests are you
talking about?
Oh.
Mama. Mama,
an old man, and a young man,
who looks like a butcher,
they are saying
you are selling a property.
That’s them. That’s them, mama.
That’s them.
They have come to check on us
with an excuse.
Hey what are you looking at?
Go seat them.
Listen, bring them with a lot of respect.
Understand?
Go. Oh mama, I am so excited,
I cannot tell you.
come on, let’s go.
Come on. Come on.
Mama, by the way, who are these people?
What property are they talking about?
Mama, see the words they are using.
Do you want to give us
your property or not?
What is a bigger wealth for us,
then Mahir? Huh?
You know I don’t understand
what you people are talking about?
Hey they have come
with a proposal for Mahir,
and actually, they have come
to see our home and behaviour.
Now you people be really courteous.
What if we miss this proposal
cause of you people.
Yes, and this girl is Mahir’s love.
Come on, come on, hey,
I didn’t wear my shoes.
Wait for me.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Hey, mama, this is your home, right?
Sit. Sit. Come on, sit.
Yes. yes.
Come, sit. Sit.
Yes.
Shehanshah, go arrange tea
and snacks. Come on.
No. No. there is no need for that.
We came here to talk about the property.
My name is Nizam Uddin and
this is my son, Imamdin.
We have heard that
you have a property for sale.
Hah,
by saying sale,
you have hurt my heart.
I didn’t like that at all. No. No.
So, you tell me,
what word should we use?
Uncle, we don’t believe in selling,
we are presenting a present to you.
Believe me,
it is mama’s entire universe.
You just accept the gift,
don’t say no,
or else it will break our heart.
No. No. No. We wont say no,
and we accept it.
We accept it completely.
Let’s go have tea. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come.
Will you tell me some details?
Look these are delicate matters,
in fact, I would say that if you let us
meet a man of your home,
it would be better.
Why not? Why not?
We will introduce you to everyone.
We know well that you have come
to meet the man of the home,
but unfortunately, he is not at home.
You will have to visit again.
But anyway, now we will have visits.
Look, then you got into the formality
of this tea and snacks for no reason.
Okay, then we will leave.
You do one thing,
you give us your contact number
and you take our number.
Now we will have to stay in touch.
So, soon?
We won’t let you go so soon uncle.
We too want to do some inquiry,
right mama?
Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.
We should inquire.
Yes, so we have no objections either.
Yes, this is the sign of people
from good families.
So, how many children do you have?
I have three children.
Okay.
This is my elder son, and then
I have another son after him,
who helps us out in the business.
I also have a daughter,
she is studying right now.
This is really good.
You should educate girls, right?
But what if the proposal gets fixed,
there is no harm in that.
Girls study after marriage too.
Right, mama?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.
You tell me, what do you think?
Yes, I find what you say really reasonable.
You found it to be reasonable, right?
then we found it to be really reasonable.
So what is the delay for?
Should we fix the proposal?
To fix the proposal of a girl,
you need a boy too, sister.
Hey, you are calling me your sister,
and you are also acting like a stranger.
Hey, we have a boy at our home,
that is why we are talking.
Papa, I say that the environment of
the home looks decent through the women,
the son will also be good,
reasonable, take things forward.
Yes, yes, all that is fine,
but suddenly like this?
Not suddenly,
this was a long planning we know this.
We like your girl with all our heart.
Without seeing her?
Hey, what is there to see?
She is your daughter so she would be
simple and smart like you, right?
My samosa. 
Give me my samosa.
Give me my samosa.
I want my samosa.
Give me my samosa.
Give it. I will cry a lot.
I want the mobile.
Give me the mobile.
Get me a mobile.
I don’t know, they feel confused.
Mama, one second.
One second.
The whole family knows about
our daughter’s angry temperament.
That is why no one sends a proposal.
These people are getting trapped,
so we shouldn’t say no.
Hey papa, we will fix
the proposal before we leave.
Hey, all that is fine,
but what if the boy is handicapped,
blind, deaf, or mute.
Here you go,
here is the boy too.
Isn’t he handsome?
You are asking for our daughter’s hand
for this prince?
They want it like this.
see how they are acting,
they have come with the excuse
of the property.
Yes.
We really liked you people.
Yes, even we don’t have an objection,
but the thing is we will ask
for time as per the custom.
We are the girl’s family.
Yes, why not? Sure.
Hey papa, before their mind changes,
we should leave. Fix everything.
Then consider the proposal final
from us as well.
Oh congratulations.
Have sweets. Have sweets.
Have some sweets. Have some sweets.
You too have it. Have some sweets.
Yes, great.
Okay, then I will wait
for your phone call.
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
We will go now sister.
Yes, there my son and
daughter in law are here.
Come. Come.
These are Mahir’s future in-laws
and we have fixed Mahir’s proposal.
Okay, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mama, what are you saying?
How can you fix Mahir’s proposal.
Hamad, did you see?
What I say is right,
you have no place in this home. Because of you,
no one respects me either.
They didn’t even bother asking us,
they did everything behind our back
and now she is announcing it.
Be quiet.
Don’t instigate my son being
the queen of emotions.
This proposal hasn’t been fixed
with our will, but with Mahir’s will.
Oh, with Mahir’s will?
He used to think so highly.
I thought he would marry a princess.
See these people,
they don’t even look like the servants
working at the castle of a princess.
Even my heart is worried,
but thank God, Mahir has agreed
to get married.
Now I pray to God,
that the girl is as per our standard.
What if we get a shock seeing her.
It was such a memorable trip.
I had fun, I would say let’s go back.
Lets do one thing,
we will drop him here.
You go back, brother.
Hey, great weather and such friends.
It is amazing. Wow.
Hey man, all of you stay quiet,
I am getting a call from home.
Hey you…
Yes, greeting grandma.
Greetings son,
when are you reaching?
Grandma, I will reach in an hour.
Okay great. I am waiting for you
impatiently come quickly.
Okay grandma. okay. I am coming.
Come soon.
His face tells us that he is shocked
to hear about his marriage.
This is a joke, right?
You people are joking with me, right?
This is not a joke,
it is a reality.
And all this happened cause of Rania.
Thank her.
Mama, what is the need to thank me?
This was my responsibility.
Tell me, something.
Who sent you here?
What is the conspiracy that
you have come here with?
What do you mean?
Don’t lie to me.
Who wants to ruin my happiness?
There is someone who has sent you
on a mission that go,
go and ruin Mahir’s life.
Who is he? Who is he?
Oh, what is wrong with you?
What are you saying?
I think he has lost his mind a
little out of happiness, mama.
Really?
If I have lost my mind a little,
then you have lost your mind completely.
Who told you that I want
to get married like this?
Don’t deny it.
Don’t deny it.
I had heard with my own ears,
he was giving new ideas.
Send the family over to check
the property as an excuse.
Where?
Home, where else?
Whose home?
Hey, you must have called them
to our home.
Hey idiot,
I had asked Ifrah’s family
to go to Salik’s home.
Why?
Because Salik and Ifrah love each other.
Stop. Stop. Where?
First answer me,
who told you to interfere in my matter?
Son, the wish to get you married was
in my heart for so long.
But when Rania told me that
you are planning secretly with a girl,
then I had put her to spy on you.
This is the limit.
Salik is such a good friend of mine,
and Irfah too.
She is such an old friend of mine.
They will think that I did all this.
I stabbed them in the back.
Now how will I go explain to them
that I didn’t show this enmity,
it has been done by mama’s beloved.
Mahir, I sympathize with you completely.
You leave it. Please.
I don’t want any sympathies from you.
One minute. Everyone wait.
Control your emotions and
hear me out.
Hey, for God’s sake,
I beg you, I request you,
now don’t give any more ideas,
we will handle it.
You go and rest in your room. Go.
Mama.
Yes?
The thing to think about is
that Mahir had told Ifrah to send her family
over to Salik’s home with an excuse.
So that they can change their opinion
by showing their good nature.
That’s what you had said, right?
Yes, so?
So then why did Ifrah’s family come here
and not go to Salik’s home?
Yes.
This is something
we need to think about.
Yes, mama, now there can only be
two things.
Either that madam Ifrah likes him
and she sent her family here on purpose
instead of Salik’s home
or else…
or else,
those people who came, they…
they were not Ifrah’s family.
Yes, this.
This second thing is correct.
Oh.
This means those people actually came here
for the property.
Yes.
that’s how it seems.
I found them to have really good luck.
They came for something ordinary and
something so big happened.
They got such a good proposal
doing nothing.
What is wrong, uncle?
Are you still stuck on the same thing?
No, not at all.
I am telling you grandma,
I am not the hero from the 80s
that I will get married where you tell me
to and to whom you want.
I will get married by my will.
Now nothing can be done, brother Mahir.
The proposal is fixed,
and we are people from a good family,
we don’t step back after giving our word.
Really?
If you care so much about
your family’s customs and traditions,
then this uncle who is sitting here,
get him married for the second time.
What? What is wrong?
What are you saying?
Why are your eyes glowing up?
everyone listen to me carefully,
I am the daughter in law of this home.
I swear to Hamad’s head,
you don’t have to repeat this again.
You come with me.
What is wrong?
We have a serious issue here,
my presence here is important.
Come on.
I say come on.
This is the limit.
Oh, what will happen now?
What would I know?
it is a problem of you people,
deal with it yourself.
What is wrong? Why are you so angry?
Drink cold water.
Cool down. I don’t like your style.
I saw with these eyes,
how your eyes got a glow like a 200 watt bulb
on the mention of the second marriage.
I don’t know,
did I have a glow in my eyes?
You should have at least scolded Mahir
on such a bad joke.
I…I…I…I…was about to scold him,
you started scolding me.
Had you waited a little you would have seen
how badly I would have scolded him.
I am going out to check the scene.
And if you try to come out,
I will break your…
I understand. I understand.
Second marriage.
Hey, hey, hey, brother Mahir,
you cannot go anywhere.
Where are you going?
This matter is yours equally as it is ours.
Had you not advised that girl secretly,
neither would we have had
a misunderstanding.
Mama,
you must have the number of those
elderly people in your phone, right?
Give it to me,
I will sort the issue right now.
Oh hello, leave it.
No need to give her the phone, grandma.
I cannot trust you,
if you could you would fix
my wedding date today.
Mama, you are worried how we have to
excuse ourselves, right?
Yes.
Then I will talk to them. I will talk
diplomatically in a decent manner.
Hey, I am an expert in these things.
Give it to me.
No, grandma, no.
Grandma…
Okay, the game is over,
give me all the money
that you had bet.
Here…
Hey, it wasn’t fifty rupees, the bet was for
sixty rupees, give me ten rupees more.
Yes,
it is fine.
One minute.
Greetings. Mr. Nizam Uddin.
How are you?
Who are you?
I am the same where you fixed
the wedding of your unlucky girl.
What are you saying?
Why would our daughter be unlucky?
You too are unlucky.
You didn’t think for a moment,
these people who are fixing the proposal
without seeing your daughter,
there can be an issue.
Hey, okay, you didn’t fix the proposal,
but we asked for the proposal, right?
Hey, the old woman got impressed
with the decency on our face
and asked for the proposal.
I think uncle you have never seen
your face in the mirror.
You look like a spy.
And your son, he looks like a
mad wolf, I swear.
Hey, hey, who are you?
Why are you insulting me so much?
I am a member of this family.
My conscience woke up,
and I thought I would inform you.
You don’t be fooled by these schemers.
Their son is completely mad.
And they are planning to get him
married to a family like yours.
Huh?
Are you speaking the truth?
Yes, it is 100% true.
You know, he is not that mad,
but when he gets a fit,
God forgive me,
it is an intense attack, I swear.
He does weird things,
he loses his senses.
He starts biting on the bed sheet,
and on top of that, he holds on hard
to the pillow and starts singing.
Hey, do you not have shame?
You were going to fix the proposal of
such a mad man with our daughter?
Huh.
I pray to God his wedding
is fixed with you.
Hey, uncle, you are praying for me.
You know there are no chances,
but miracles do happen.
Hey, listen to one thing carefully,
don’t call me again.
Yes. Yes. Better.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Here, it was just a game of two minutes,
I got it sorted.
After today,
you stay away from my matters.
Understand?
If you talk to me like this,
then I will call up Mr. Nizamuddin again.
And you don’t know me,
if I get stuck on something,
the proposal is something ordinary,
I will get you married by the evening.
Understand?
Hey, then go get yourself married.
Idiot.
Look at him.
Instead of thanking me,
he is showing me attitude.
Don’t mind, mama, you left a lot of lacking
in his upbringing.
Now there is just one solution,
find a wife, who fixes him.
Hey, it is really difficult
to find such a girl.
Hey, leave that to me.
I will find such a girl that
you will thank me.
You will pray for me.
You will pray.
He is so angry at you,
that whatever proposal you bring,
he will never agree now.
Leave him,
everything will be done secretly.
I will find the girl,
you take the credit, okay?
Okay, then lets try.
Let’s try.
