And tell me, which ring should I give?
Mother, the one I gave you.
So that's why you got me the ring.
Oh I die, mother, look who's here.
Rafique Ahmed, you haven't left yet?
Listen, if you're here to get your son
engaged to our Rabail again
then that isn't possible.
If you're here as Saman's father-in-law
to join in our celebration then welcome.
Welcome, come on, come on.
Rania we have guests over,
make way for them.
Welcome, welcome,
come on in.
Uncle, with a big heart,
congratulate grandmother.
See, her granddaughter got engaged
even after your rejection.
And look how they got such a nice guy,
in a few minutes.
Rafique Ahmed, come here
and sit with us.
Come on, spit the anger.
Brother Khawar,
have a seat.
Come on, come on.
Proud of you.
Sister Anjum?
Why did you come so late?
Oh so this is what it is?
That's what you were hiding from me?
That's him.
Come let me introduce you
to the bride and groom.
Here we have our sister Anjum.
Here's our brother groom,
and she's our bride.
You got a nice catch.
Okay, now we will dance.
Get up, get up, get up.
Get up brother.
Get up.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
My sister's marriage?
That too with that monkey Farhad?
Never.
Rabail won't be marrying him.
I think there was a prior planning.
People think a thousand times
before sending a proposal
and they did it in a moment.
There is something fishy,
there is something fishy.
What are you doing here?
The guests are asking for you.
Why?
Why are they asking for me?
When did I become so important?
If I were important everything would be
happening according to me today,
not according to that Rania.
"Asking for me"
And you should go,
go look for that Rania.
If she is not here,
how will the world manage?
Go, go.
Mahir my child,
there is a time for everything,
you should see if it's an appropriate time
before you get mad.
Do you understand?
There are so many guests outside.
How can Hammad manage on his own?
He can't even manage his hair,
how can he manage the guests?
And don't forget,
you are Rabail's brother.
I don't approve of this relationship.
You don't approve of this?
People outside are happily
dancing like crazy.
Now come on, come.
Okay then,
I'll also stand here and wait for you.
Even if my plan gets spoiled.
I was going to dance,
a video was going to be recorded.
My dance partner Rania,
she's also waiting for me.
But doesn't matter.
You can join us, it's not a problem
if you can dance with an injured leg.
I'm not going outside.
I don't want to go, I'm good here.
You're good here?
If that brother Rafique and family
can return and enjoy our event,
then what are you?
Uncle Rafique, returned?
Yes, he went and returned,
everyone is celebrating,
come and see for yourself
if you don't believe.
Come on, let's go.
For my sake, come on.
Where did this woman
hide the passport?
Brother Khawar, move aside a little.
Everyone dances on their own happiness,
what matters is when someone dances
on another's happiness.
Now look,
2-3 dance moves are justified
for such a joyous occasion.
People who got angry at your rejection
will also get happy.
Really?
Yes, have I ever given someone
the wrong advice?
No.
Then, come on let’s go.
Hey, brother Khawar is here,
brother Khawar is here.
Look, was I lying?
Everyone is happy.
Have you seen it?
Aunt.
Clever girl,
she made a fool out of everyone.
Rania.
Took advantage of my innocence.
Had me on her side by talking sweet.
Farhad? Like a brother?
He's like her biological brother.
Cheater, liar, and dishonest,
just like her.
I won't spare him.
It seems like nobody fed you sweets,
let me get the sweets.
Don't try to be an over smart,
I understand everything.
All this planning, all this arrangement
is yours, right?
Just look at me now,
you have underestimated me a lot.
I'll end this relationship right now,
in a minute.
What happened, are you mad?
What do you even want,
for two of Rabail's relationship
to fail in a day?
First Khawar rejected
in front of everyone,
now you're planning to scare off
Farhad as well.
Poor Rabail won't be able
to take it anymore.
And people will make grandmother's
life hell by taunts.
And the respect lost won't be recovered even
by the dollars sent by your father.
Think about it.
First you sabotaged the relationship
with Khawar
and now you have a problem
with Farhad?
What, I did or you did?
How dramatic you are.
Look, look at them,
my sweet brother looks even
more cute while dancing.
If he really looks that cute,
then go,
be with him, dance with him,
do whatever you want with him,
die with him.
Okay, if someone asks me,
I will tell them that his lover left him
and that's why he is in sorrow.
Okay? Keep standing here,
I'm going.
Brother, wait a second.
One second, one second.
How are you getting your
video recorded with this face?
It's a video, not a picture.
You'll regret it your whole life.
Smile or I'll tickle you, smile.
Smile,
a bigger smile.
Brother? A solo.
Father,
you still wake me up like
I'm going to school.
I've grown up now.
You'll always be like
a little girl to me,
the one who used to walk to school,
holding my hand,
and the one I carried
on the way back home.
The one who made a lot of demands.
Really?
I still make demands
but they don't come true.
Really?
When did it happen that you asked me
something and I didn't get it for you?
That means it wasn't important,
my father forgot.
Might have forgotten, tell me
what did you ask for?
You don't remember?
Give me a hint at least.
I gave you a hint every day.
Father, I want to study law.
Coming.
Hello?
Hello?
Please, please listen to me,
don't hang up the phone.
How many times we have told you
to not waste our time or your time?
You don't have any relation left with us.
Even the memories died a death of time.
I understand that I do not deserve
the forgiveness.
But I still call anyway,
just in hope of one thing.
You're the only one
who can get me forgiveness
from father.
Now I'll make a request to you.
Don't call here,
I've hardly picked up the pieces
of my existence,
if it shatters again,
I won't be able to hold myself together.
Go back to your world
and let us stay happy in ours.
At least let me know
how is my daughter?
What daughter?
You don't have a daughter.
Don't say this.
The daughter's fathers are
very responsible,
they save their daughter from
every harsh thing if the world,
stay with her like a shadow.
You left your young wife
and daughter in the responsibility
of your old father Mr. Zaman.
Think about it,
do you deserve forgiveness?
Father? What's the matter?
Are you alright?
Let me check your blood pressure.
Oh no, I'm quite alright.
Did you have dinner?
Son, I was thinking I should go back.
What do you mean father?
Did I make a mistake?
Son it's just that...
I can find peace in these populated places.
For the last 2 years,
I was spending my retired life,
in a valley surrounded by the mountains.
Probably that's better for me.
Father, I cannot let you go in this condition,
please get this thought out of your mind.
I haven't eaten either,
I'll ask them to serve the dinner
then we'll eat together.
Okay.
They own a cow farm.
And apart from that
they have a clinic as well,
one in the neighborhood,
the other is in Lahore.
Along with the animals, he sometimes
treat humans as well.
He has a sweet tooth that's why
he talks sweetly.
Let us know how many animals
have you cured?
I never counted
but all the hens are satisfied with me.
And all the cows as well,
there is a great business of milk.
Brother Sadiq, tell them comfortably.
Oh I brought farm eggs
and pure milk for Asma.
You people can try as well.
Yes but what matters to us, is the reputation,
background, not the eggs.
Bebo?
If you want to say talk about something
with the doctor then go ahead.
Yes, I have an important inquiry.
Actually the problem is my friend's dog
has gone mad,
he's biting everyone at the street
for no reason,
and the problem is he isn't
even telling us the reason.
Can you discuss it with the dog
and find out the reason behind it?
Yes I can,
instead we can go right now
and talk to the dog.
It's a yes from my side.
It shouldn't be a problem
to go together.
From our side, it's a.
No.
Because I can't come in between
you and your cows.
You can have the dessert.
Thank God,
Rabail will be getting married
to such a nice family.
Because after listening to the stories surrounding
Khawar's character I was so worried.
Farhad is a really nice guy
and family is good too.
And did this madam tell you
about this?
Yes, I told her, then?
She said and you believed.
She didn't know them
for ages either.
It wasn't even a week and you decided
on Rabail's relationship.
And you did very wrong with
Rabail by believing her.
If it was really bad then
you could have found a proposal.
God blessed this family with such
a great and calm son-in-law,
and look at him.
Being ungrateful.
Tell me grandmother,
what did I do in all this?
Did I force Farhad to get engaged
to Rabail at gunpoint?
Not at all,
it was their humanity that
they cared enough.
Well I'm observing, you're getting
mannerless day by day.
I think, there should be someone
in your life.
Wow, what did you just say,
grandmother.
Absolutely right.
And you don't even have to look far away,
We have someone at our home, Mona.
What a pair it'll be,
one arrogant the other idle.
I mean, she's naive,
she'll agree easily.
Because any smart girl won't even
look at such boys.
If a person cannot say good things about
another one then they should stay quiet.
Grandmother, please explain to her,
tell her to not interfere in my matters.
And whoever I will marry,
will be my decision,
not someone else's.
No what do you think,
I'll find some random girl for you?
To make your bride?
Yes, that's what I think.
Because you haven’t been thinking
with your own mind lately,
you are thinking
with someone else's.
Here we go,
started complaining again.
Okay grandmother,
I am going to the university.
Do you know my name is on the merit list,
that too on top.
I have to go to the university,
for the rest of the process.
Wow my child.
I'm sympathizing with the university.
They'll have to face all this.
What good is this verbal sympathy,
it'll matter if you go then and
cancel my admission.
Grandmother, call your brother
and tell him,
it's better to get her married
than spending whatever he has collected
all his life on her education.
Because when girls like her go out
in the society they can cause a riot.
My grandfather is not near-sighted
and narrow-minded like you.
My grandfather is very broad-minded
and has a progressive mind.
Do you understand?
Oh, leave him, let him be.
How will you go to the university?
I'll go by a taxi grandmother,
uncle took the bike and I don't know
how to drive a car.
I have asked your grandson
a number of times
but he never taught me.
Listen to me, go, and drop her off
at the University.
What?
Me, and drop her off?
Grandmother, I don't have so much spare time
to drop her off at the university.
There is a small request,
so please don't ask me for the tasks of
such random, strange, and useless people.
I'm leaving.
You have no idea how much you've hurt me
with your words.
Sorry grandmother,
but what can I do,
I have to use such words because of
your brother's spoiled granddaughter.
Let it be grandmother,
I'll go by myself,
how long would it take maximum?
4 hours.
It's okay.
Have some shame,
have some shame.
You've disgraced me.
Let it be grandmother,
why are you getting embarrassed?
He is not even listening to you.
It's not like that grandmother I really
have to go for something important.
Where? To Salik?
Then to a restaurant?
Let me tell you,
I'm not idle like you.
I run my own business along
with the studies.
I buy and sell properties,
I'm going for that.
Here we go.
Keep it up.
You've disgraced your old grandmother.
Leave him grandmother,
I'm leaving,
don't worry, and take care of yourself.
Bye.
Listen,
you're the guest at our house,
we have to serve you.
Let's go?
Thank you, grateful, indebted.
Good job, son, good job.
I knew you wouldn't ignore my request.
Now go, take her to the university,
and then bring her home,
how will she return alone?
Bring her back as well?
Should we go?
You first.
Bye.
Nice, very nice,
yay yay.
Oh, how did the TV turn off?
What happened brother?
Hello? I'm missing the game.
Oh brother what happened?
Why did you turn off?
Where is the connection?
Start working.
Oh man.
Whose passport is this?
Yes, yes this is mine.
This is my passport.
Thank God, I found it,
found it.
Man, in awe of this woman's mind.
Where did she hide,
I wouldn't have looked here all my life.
you brother, thank you.
I've found my passport because of you.
Dabeer.
Dabeer.
Yes, yes, yes?
Why did you switch off the TV?
My favorite drama was up next.
I didn't switch it off,
it turned off on its own,
I was just trying to make it work.
Where is the remote?
Remote is right here but there might be
a problem from the back.
I'll get back,
I'll be back, in a minute,
I'll be back in a minute.
Why do you always have
an upset stomach?
Don't know where she is at.
Should we leave if you are done?
Now that you are going to the university,
stay reserved,
don't start interfering in
everyone's matters there as well.
Not everyone is cool minded like me
don't forget this.
Okay, anything else?
I am dropping you off only
because of grandmother,
don't expect me to give you pick
and drop daily.
I also don't have any interest,
I'm going there out of compulsion,
who would want it?
Can we go now?
Sit, have a seat.
You are going there in a Prado,
don’t start bragging.
Don’t forget the lies don’t last.
Because if someone asks me,
I’ll tell them honestly,
she came here by bus from Khushlalpur.
Bragging is only a trait
for people like you.
Smart girls like me always
have a plan B.
I know your plan B.
Stop the car, stop the car.
What happened now?
I will tell you.
Where are you going?
Farhad, hi, are you going
to the university?
Yes, why?
Could you drop yes well?
Yes, why not?
Come, have a seat.
Just a second.
Mahir, you can go,
manage your great business.
I’m leaving, bye.
Hey.
Bye.
Thank you, man.
It’s okay, my pleasure.
University ends a while ago.
Where is she?
Sister arrived.
She’s here? Then why isn’t
she coming in?
I didn’t ask her to come in.
I understand, she must have gone
to his house with him.
He’s such a bitter person,
I know him very well.
Brother Mahir,
who are you talking about?
Who are you talking about?
Mona’s taxi.
Where did this Mona come from?
Here she is.
Sister, give me the bags,
that’s my job.
My Mona is leaving.
Oh, okay okay, bye.
I’ll be getting married, do attend
when I’ll invite you.
Okay, okay. I’ll see.
And if I couldn’t attend it, I will send you
an envelope or a gift.
That’s your own choice
whether you’ll come or not.
Ok bye.
Bye Mona.
I’ll miss you.
Call me.
Thank you so much Farhad,
you’re really nice.
Bye.
Bye.
Admission in university,
that means another dream came true.
Now I’ll keep moving forward
like this if God wills.
You went to the university?
Yes, so?
Can you see the time?
Yes, such delicate times it is,
a brother isn’t true to their brother
in this time.
Move away, why are you standing
in front of me like to this?
For so long I’ve been concerned.
Grandmother, has been concerned
for you for so long.
And you don’t care about her?
I informed her while going.
And I’m not returning at midnight
from a picnic.
Move away I’ll talk to her by myself.
She’s not here, she went to the neighbors
Oh, that’s good, for some time
I want to dream with my eyes open.
Don’t disturb me with your loud voice,
okay? Bye.
Do you know
when I went to the university with her,
he took me for the ice cream.
Oh wow.
And he also talked a lot.
Do you want to know
what he was talking about?
Tell me.
He mentioned you in every sentence.
I even got annoyed at one point.
I said stop it now, but no,
he kept talking about you.
He loves you a lot.
Lucky you.
I know that’s why I stay so happy.
Listen to me,
keep this University aside,
find a good guy, and get married.
You’re exactly like your brother.
You have the same mindset.
Your brother said, marry her off.
But I won’t let go of my purpose
because of people like Mahir.
Let me get in power once.
Then I’ll arrange for their 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th marriage as well.
Then they will get to know.
The ones who want me to get married.
4 marriages aren’t a lot?
Oh hello, hero.
You’re posing really cute.
Seems like you’re trying to impress
your fiancé, right?
Seems like he heard my kind thoughts
about him secretly.
Sister Anjum, let me clear it
for you today,
he is not my fiancé.
What? Oh God.
He broke the engagement?
Anyway, pretty boys are ugly at heart.
But don’t worry,
I won’t let this happen to you,
I will go and talk to the hero.
Hey, no, listen.
Come here, sit.
I’ll tell you, come sit, sit, sit.
Sit.
It would be cruel only if there were
ever an engagement.
There was never and engagement
and there never will.
It’s better to die
then marry a person like that.
Well Rania,
I couldn’t completely grasp that.
You can’t possibly.
Tell me how are you visiting?
Oh, I remembered.
I am here to examine grandmother,
she insisted at Rabail’s engagement.
And I also had to convey
Dr. Wasiq’s message to you.
What message?
Actually, we are arranging a small event
at the children’s ward of our hospital.
We just want to make the set
and sad children happy.
Just for a short time but we are
trying to help with their pain.
And Dr. Wasiq really wants you
to attend.
Me?
Yes.
It’s such a kind act,
I’ll definitely come and participate.
Okay.
Now tell me the story in detail,
what’s with you and Mahir?
Ideal couple,
isn’t a couple anymore?
Oh God, oh my God.
Okay, okay, don’t cry.
I’m ideal, him?
He’s a bad idea.
It’s a long story,
listen carefully.
Who wants this car?
Are you interested in cars?
You want this?
Will you play with this?
Here you go then, it’s yours.
Very nice.
There are a lot of gifts for you all as well.
Who wants this? Bat and ball?
You?
You’re good at cricket?
Here you go then. It’s yours.
And this will be yours and this, yours.
Wait a second,
why are all the children so bored?
You’re my friends, right?
Right?
Then you’ll have to be active like me,
stay happy like me and laugh like me.
Like this.
Good job.
You all are so brave.
All of you are like me.
Are you scared of insects?
No, I’m not scared
of the mouse as well.
What’s funny in it?
You don’t think I’m brave?
Just a little?
Just a little? Not a lot?
Grandmother?
Yes, grandmother?
Son Mahir, where are you?
I’m on my way home.
Do one thing, Rania is out,
she went to Dr. Wasiq’s hospital,
so when you return pick her up.
Hospital? Why?
Is everything alright?
Yes, yes, everything is alright,
but there is an event at the hospital
so Dr. Wasiq invited her.
So pick her up on your way home.
Grandmother, even we don’t know
enough people in so many years
than she got to know
in such a small time.
What are you saying?
Nothing, I will bring her.
Okay, well, bye.
I don’t know what events are happening.
I think this doctor is interested and her.
This Rania, spoiled my mood.
Friendship with everyone,
talks to everyone.
She thinks of this city
as her grandfather’s Khushalpur.
I have to do something about her.
Father.
Greetings father.
How does it all look?
It looks great.
Rania, this is Dr. Wasiq’s father.
Hey, father.
This is Rania, she agreed on my one call,
on my request.
And she’s such a nice girl.
Really?
Yes.
She decorated the whole ward,
in fact, helping me keep children happy
and making them smile.
You’re doing a great job.
Because only the people who spread
happiness deserves to be called human.
You’re definitely a great girl,
your parents taught you well.
Thank you.
Well, how long are you going to take?
I’m here to pick you up.
Father, I’ll get a little late.
Do one thing, have a seat here, today
we’ll have lunch with all these children.
Yes, yes, sure.
Thank you father.
Come, please, have a seat.
Sister will you tell us a story?
I can also tell a story.
No, I don’t want to listen to you.
You give injections
and bitter medicines.
Bad habit, good ones
don’t talk to elders like this.
All of you are really good children,
you have to have the bitter medicines
and the injection as well,
how else will you get better?
You want to go home soon?
Then you have to bear this,
these doctors and
nurses are your friends,
just like I’m your friend.
All of us want you to get well soon,
get healthy soon,
and go back to your homes happily.
Okay so I’ll tell you a story.
Want to hear it?
I’ll tell you a story
about a very brave girl,
who wanted to become
a prime minister.
