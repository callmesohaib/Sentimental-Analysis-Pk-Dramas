Feed me quickly,
or I will turn off the video.
I am feeding you.
You two know well that
in the greed to watch videos you are making
your lazy father, lazier. Huh?
Now it has come to this that
you cannot even peel the peanuts,
I don’t know how you are chewing it.
Get out of here.
I should see books in your hand,
do your homework.
What is this?
I don’t like this informality at all.
Okay?
Hamad, right now
I just know one thing
that my sister and I have
no respect in this home.
Zero.
They have taken us lightly.
Oh.
What, oh?
Your arrogant,
haughty nephew.
I had just said that
hey take my Mona for ice cream.
He said no to my face.
Clear no.
Really?
Yes.
Mona has her hands and feet,
tell her to eat ice cream herself.
What is the big deal in this?
It is not that. It is that saying to Mona,
he made Rania sit in the car
and he went away.
Oh.
There is a limit to shamelessness.
They are so close and
go together everywhere.
And mama?
Mama too has closed her eyes,
she is really lenient.
Hamad you are Mahir’s uncle.
I say use your right,
stop all this.
I use my right.
Taking Rania with him comes
under shamelessness,
so from tomorrow
he should take Mona.
I should say this, right?
Oh God, I had forgotten
who I was coming to for help.
You don’t even realize
that all the effort
that I am putting in is for whom?
For you, for our children.
Once Mona gets married to Mahir and
comes to this home, our life will be set.
Think of a reasonable plan,
then come to me.
Right now, don’t disturb me.
I am really busy.
I am really very busy.
Now I think of a plan as well,
you don’t want to do anything yourself.
Hey, you know how
to conspire and plan,
I don’t know how to do it.
If you cannot do anything else,
then do one small thing.
Can you go to mama and tell her
that they are going alone for outing
it puts a question on our family’s name.
I can say that.
Yes, then go say it.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
Fine.
Hamad.
Why does Mahir dislike his name
with yours so much?
I don’t know. It’s up to him.
Your friend is really self-loving.
Oh God.
My friend
and nothing for you?
Sadly, he is my relative,
but he is always fighting with me.
You know since I found out
about his mental issue,
I have cut down on the fighting
with him.
Now I feel sympathy seeing him.
Poor thing.
One minute.
What mental issue?
I read about such a person
in the psychology book.
It stated…
Rania.
Hey, is your duty off?
It will get over soon.
Okay, you tell me how are you?
How is your neighbour’s girl Laiba?
Everything is fine.
You tell me about your doctor,
did his sorrows reduce a little or not?
Huh? What sorrows?
There is some sorrow,
that is why he goes around
with a face that has just cried.
What is going on, here?
Sir, I didn’t even start anything right now,
I already stopped.
Had I not stopped myself,
I would have been in trouble.
Greetings doctor.
How are you?
Will you have some?
You are back here, again?
Yes, till the time
you don’t fix our patient,
we will keep on visiting. Right?
that elderly woman’s condition
is much better,
she will be discharged till tomorrow.
So why are you saying this
with so much sorrow?
What are you saying?
Why would I say this with sorrow?
And staff is your duty time over?
No, sir, just two minutes are left.
Then go and do your duty in the ward,
don’t stand here and talk.
Sure.
And you people go sit
in your patient’s room,
what is the reason to roam around
in the hospital like this?
Yes, doctor we were going. Yes, Rania,
come on let’s go. Yes, doctor.
What is his problem?
He is such a negative person.
Instead of being a doctor,
he should have been a jailer.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Yes, where are you?
Are you still in the hospital
or have you left?
My duty just got off,
I will leave shortly.
Okay, do one thing.
When coming home, do meet Salwa,
she must be waiting for you.
Hello.
Hey, what is the matter?
Why are you not answering me?
What do I say, papa?
She doesn’t care about me.
If she cared for me even a little,
then she would have called me,
but she didn’t call me.
I always call her.
I convince her,
even if it is my fault or not.
And you…
I think you don’t even know this.
Maybe you never noted him.
But this time I have decided
that I wont call her now,
I will let her be.
I will wait for her to call me.
You are so upset.
Okay, no problem.
When you come home
we will talk.
Goodbye.
Yes, fine. Goodbye.
You?
Yes, I came to talk to you
about something.
You were busy on the call,
maybe you were discussing
a personal matter.
I am so sorry…
You say what you have come to say.
There is nothing left to say now.
I have heard you talk.
You, yourself…
You please say what you came to say.
I told you.
Okay.
I just came to tell you
that a doctor’s medication
doesn’t affect a patient
as much as his smile and good nature.
But what I heard you talk about,
it makes me realize that your own life…
Excuse me, miss, whoever you are,
I don’t like discussing
my personal life with anyone.
You can leave.
It is a good habit.
It is a really good habit.
You should solve your own issues.
Okay, I will leave then.
Goodbye.
By the way convincing someone
doesn’t reduce your respect,
it increases,
and the one who takes the first step
in ending a fight,
that person is the strongest.
That is, it.
Mama, Mahir and Rania
haven’t come till now.
Yes, so do you want something?
What would I want?
I am used to doing all my work
with my own hands.
Since when?
No mama, I was saying that
Mahir and Rania haven’t come back till now.
It is so late at night,
the two of them are out at this hour of the night,
it doesn’t seem reasonable.
Our family has a custom,
and we are proud of it.
The girls of our family are really decent,
respectable and good character
and the boys of our family, oh,
they are the protectors
of the respect of our family.
The customs of our family
should remain like this.
Our children shouldn’t be
affected by the society.
Stop it.
What is the need for such
a long drama. Be quiet.
Yes, mama?
What do you want to say?
Oh mama, what is wrong?
I will have to say all this again?
Why did you not hear it at the first time,
mama?
I heard every single word of yours.
Thank God.
How did you even think that
Rania would do anything wrong,
and that Mahr, can you ever think
anything wrong about him?
No. No, mama. I was saying that
those two have been gone since the evening,
they are still not back. That’s it.
They have gone to the hospital
to meet a patient.
Hospital.
So what do you think
he has taken her out for ice cream.
Hey mama, where did the ice cream
come from? This…
Come on, go. Go and rest.
You must be tired, you have been
talking for so long. Huh?
You are not used to working or talking.
You are acting like the protector
of the family name and respect.
Mama, tea.
Give him tea.
He must be tired of coming here
from him room, to complain.
Mama, if he drinks tea,
he will get tired too.
Tea.
Is it hot?
What?
Mama, can I go to my room?
Get lost.
Thank God, Ifrah’s grandmother
is fine now.
The staff was telling me that she will
get discharged from the hospital soon.
You were getting
so frank with the staff
like she is your childhood friend.
Yes. Like you are my childhood fiancé.
When they were calling you my fiancé,
your face was a to watch.
I had a lot of fun.
I had a lot of fun. Enough.
It was not that funny.
I saw how you were enjoying it,
ask me what my heart
was going through.
Listen to me, don’t be so arrogant.
So much self-loving is not good.
Believe me.
As far as I am concerned,
I will make a will when I die,
no girl should marry an arrogant
and short tempered man.
She should die single,
but never get into this problem.
By the way, your wife,
poor thing, will be the unluckiest girl
in the world.
Rania, If you say another word,
I am telling you,
I will bang the car somewhere.
Oh God, so much anger
on something so small.
Right now I am being lenient,
I am explaining it to you
in a friendly manner.
I am explaining it to you
for your betterment.
I know you are a broken
and sad man on the inside.
God knows what mental issues
you suffer from.
Are you mad?
I am broken, sad, and mental?
Are you mad?
You don’t need to express
what you think of me, please.
This.
The way you scream and talk,
it tells me what goes on in your heart.
I didn’t scream,
but now I will scream so loudly
that you will open the car door
and jump outside.
You…
you don’t come in front of me.
I lose my temperament seeing you.
Oh God, I hurt a mad man.
Forgive me.
Here you go, your tea.
What happened?
What are you thinking?
Arbab didn’t call me or message
and I am sitting here packing my bags.
Hey, Khawar has said that all the matters
between you and mama have been sorted,
then why are you worried?
And I am sure brother Arbab
is busy in some work,
that is why he didn’t come.
Don’t worry.
Yes, so what is the issue
in making a call or message?
Don’t think useless things sitting here,
he will come.
Hey, Shehanshah,
you are playing here with the kids,
and you have an exam today.
Have you made any preparations?
Sister Rania is working so hard on you.
And you?
If you fail again, then you will see
what I will do.
I will take your phone.
Come on, get up. Get up.
Are the kids home?
Rania and Mahir?
No mama, they have not come till now.
Hey, brother Mahir is here.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings grandma. Grandma,
I will never take your beloved
anywhere after today.
Hey, what happened?
What is the issue?
She is an ill-mannered girl.
She has no manners. See, this.
She doesn’t know how to talk to anyone.
Leave it. I cannot believe this.
She is so pretty, she has a smiling face.
And there is you, you have a frown
on your face all the time.
Learn, come on.
See, the wives of upset men
are tired of them.
I don’t know why you always take her side.
I feel you are not my grandmother.
Hey, don’t you people want to eat?
We have been waiting for you,
we are sitting here, hungry.
Yes, get the food served.
This lawn sale!
Hello.
Hey, Rania, child,
how are you?
I am fine, how are you?
and Mian Jee? And aunt?
Like you really care.
You have forgotten us going to the city,
you have gotten busy.
You don’t call.
Bebo is really upset with you,
you know.
I have really become really busy,
think that I got the chance
to do social work now.
Hey, what work?
Don’t get in any work, don’t embarrass us,
don’t ruin our respect.
What is there to be embarrassed
in this, mama?
I have never understood this,
nor will I ever understand it.
Rania, listen to me,
you don’t have to get involved
in any problem. Understand?
Okay leave it, I have called you to tell you
something really weird.
God be kind. What happened?
You know, me and Rabail went
to a really big mall for shopping.
Rabail was shopping,
I didn’t want to get anything.
I was just looking at people
come and go.
And you know what I saw.
What did you see?
Mama, papa’s look alike.
It felt like papa came out of the picture
and came in front of me.
Papa?
Papa, meaning Mian Jee?
No, no, papa, meaning my papa.
What are you saying, Rania?
You too got surprised right?
I felt the same way.
Then I realized,
I am making such a big mistake,
my father is no longer in this world.
It was a stranger,
who didn’t even know.
You did good that
you didn’t go after him.
You don’t go after
any stranger like this.
And nor do you ask any questions.
Even if you see him again,
don’t go after him,
nor ask him any questions.
Do you understand me?
Fine. You know, mama,
when papa passed away,
I must really miss him,
I used to cry as well, right?
I have told you so many times
that you were really young.
Just remember this
that your Mian Jee has brought you up,
he has taken care of your wishes like father.
He has taken care of your desires.
By the way, how was papa?
He must really love me.
What is wrong? No. No, he didn’t love you,
he didn’t stay with us.
Why are you talking about these
useless things after so many years?
Whenever I talk to you
or Mian Jee about papa,
you people avoid the discussion.
He was my father, it is my right
to know about him.
Okay child, you have a lot of time.
I have been up since morning,
I am tired of working.
Now we will talk tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Can you people not play any silent games?
Like carom, or ping pong.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Mahir.
Good morning.
By the way, Mahir, I was noticing
that my Mona and
you have the same habits.
She too sleeps all day long on a holiday,
your temperament, your habit,
you know what people call this
beautiful coincidence?
Made for each other.
Aunt, please, for God’s sake,
don’t spoil my mood
early in the morning.
I am really hungry, get me breakfast.
Shehanshah,
you still haven’t broomed the place,
I have already cleaned mama’s room.
Work fast.
What are you doing?
The dust is coming in my mouth.
People with delicate temperament
can leave from here,
because we will clean
all day long today.
Oh.
Careful. Careful. Careful.
Did you hurt yourself?
No.
But thank you so much,
you saved me.
Mona, Mahir. Mahir Mona,
both of them are in a bad mood
on a holiday.
Shehanshah,
I feel this sofa will have to move.
Come on, get up. Get up.
Come on. Get up.
What is your problem?
What do you mean, problem?
God knows what trash has been
thrown under this.
Now we have to clean up.
I don’t have all day, madam.
You will have to get up.
Come on, get up.
Listen. Listen. Listen.
I have an idea.
You people go sit in my room,
I will also send breakfast there,
you people talk to each other.
There is no need for that,
I am not going anywhere,
I am fine here.
Hey, is this how you talk to elders?
She must be saying it
after thinking.
Or are you afraid of Mona
by any chance?
I am not afraid of anyone.
Then come on, please.
Then go, let me clean up.
Come on.
I am sending flat bread with
cheese omelette. Okay? Huh?
Uncle.
Yes?
Yes.
Are you busy?
I wanted to talk about something.
Okay fine, I will talk later, then.
Hey, no, sit talk to me. Sit.
Here you go.
Here.
I am no longer busy.
What happened?
Uncle, Rania called yesterday.
Okay.
She went with Rabail
to the mall for shopping.
Yes.
So she was saying she saw a man
who looked like her father there.
Usman?
Then did he meet him?
Talk to him?
She went to talk to him.
But he got lost in the crowd,
she couldn’t talk to him.
Uncle.
Uncle, Rania is my only wealth,
I don’t want to lose her.
You do anything,
just call her back.
What are you saying?
Rania knows what she has to do.
Rania is ours,
he cannot take her and go.
Uncle, he is her father.
Hey, you are her mother.
I am also there. Mian Jee.
You surprise me.
As much as we love her,
she loves us equally.
She won’t go anywhere.
Uncle, the city she is in,
Usman is in the same city.
If not sooner, then later,
she will come face to face with him.
You make any excuse and call her back.
I want my daughter here.
Don’t worry, she won’t go anywhere.
Come on, go.
Wow. Wow.
Child, you have made everything
shine in a way
that everything looks new.
Well done. Well done.
Mona, if you are done with breakfast,
then go with Shehanshah
and set Mahir’s room as well.
You have a lot of style?
Me? Why?
Are the servants at home freeloaders,
and you know my lifestyle,
how can I do all this?
It is fine, no need for it.
My room is clean.
No one will come to my room.
Mama you sent brother Mahir
for no reason.
He was in no mood to go with Mona.
Child, she is a guest.
She is our relative.
See it is our responsibility
to take care of her.
Still mama,
he was not in the mood…
Mama, guests have come over.
Guests?
My in-laws must have come.
Come on, mama.
I am coming.
I am coming.
Who is there?
Our neighbours.
The ones who live next door.
Oh…
Sit. Sit. Have a seat, aunty.
I will get tea arranged for you.
Hey, no child, where are you going?
You sit next to me.
I find her so pretty,
sit next to me.
Aunt, see your neighbours are here.
Hey, have a seat.
Have a seat.
Sit. Sit.
Welcome hundred times.
Greetings mama,
you must know me,
we have met earlier.
You had also praised me,
do you remember?
I don’t praise anyone for no reason.
How is your daughter now?
Thank God, she will start going
to school in a few days.
I came to thank you.
Rania has done a good deed with us.
The way you cared for Ayaz and
Farhad when I was in the hospital,
I really want to thank you for it.
Hey no, neighbours help neighbours.
There is a good idiom for it.
Blaming others for you own faults.
How can a monkey appreciate
the taste of ginger?
A person who copies others…
The neighbour is like a relative.
Yes, that idiom.
Yes, you are absolutely right.
See this girl has said something so good,
she is angel, always smiling.
Mama.
Mama, this is Rabail,
she is Rania’s cousin,
she too is really good, really caring.
Greetings aunty.
Greetings, live long.
So what was I telling you?
she used to take care of everyone
at the hospital.
She cared for all the patients.
She used to get connected to everyone,
she used to get their good wishes.
she is a really good child.
Mama. Mama,
Rabail’s college is right next
to Laiba’s school.
So, why don’t we send Laiba
with Rabail from tomorrow, huh?
Yes, we can think about it.
Okay so child, Rania,
what are you getting an admission?
You know, I am thinking that
a smart child like you,
whichever institute you go
to for your education,
you will make them proud.
My Rania is my brother
Anwar Siddique’s copy.
Both of them are pride of the family.
Yes, yes, I praise her day and night.
I have also told Laiba that she should spend
maximum amount of time, day and night, with Rania.
I find her to be so pretty,
I want to take her to my home.
The child is so smart.
This world’s most beautiful, good, and caring
girl is my sister from today.
Okay?
Congratulations. Congratulations.
Congratulations.
By the way, why are you so quiet, and good,
and great, coolness ends at you,
why didn’t you get married
till now?
Listen to me,
her husband is a big feudal.
I think we should leave now,
sister.
Sit down.
everyone is married.
Did you want to make someone
your sister too?
Hey, no.
You already have a sister at home,
then why did you need
to start a new conversation.
Such a pretty, caring and loving girl,
I had thought, she will come to my home
and my home will lighten up.
But, when do I have this happiness
or peace in my life?
Hey, you look around,
there is a lot of happiness…
Move back, don’t talk to me.
Mama, what happened?
Ask him. What happened?
Laiba I will tell you,
I in the presence of all the witnesses put a veil
on Rania’s head and made her my sister forever.
Wow. This is a good thing.
So from today, I too announce
to make Rania my sister.
Hey you are the only one left,
you too announce it.
Hey, sister,
I have my own sorrows,
I don’t get into all this.
And by the way,
you too know that who in this home
who is not married,
who is the elder.
That is me.
Is anyone thinking about me?
No one is thinking.
I am going.
Where are you going?
Hey, I am going to get yogurt,
you had asked me to get it.
Whatever home she goes to
she will change it for the good.
I had thought I would talk with signals,
but how could I talk?
My son announced to make her,
his sister.
It won’t happen.
Hey mama, you are great.
It is your turn now.
Here you go.
Give mama another turn.
She is winning.
Mama, go ahead.
Brother Mahir is here.
I was about to call you.
It is good you people are back.
Yes, mama was thinking that the pair
of moon and sun have stepped out,
the world will die of amazement.
Mona, so many things? Show me,
what all did you get?
I will not show it right now.
When I put it on
you can see for yourself.
Showing something again and again,
makes it old, no?
I think she didn’t show him anything,
she just showed him the bags.
That is why he is so pale.
Did someone ask you to speak?
And grandma, all the guests
that come to this home,
they are all your guests.
You don’t give me their responsibility.
Oh, my son is tired.
That is why he is saying all this.
You are absolutely right.
Same temperament.
When I get tired,
I too become ill-mannered like this.
Grandma,
I will not go anywhere
with this girl after today.
She is totally mad.
I met my friends in the mall
coincidentally.
She was coming on to me
in front of them,
like we have a scene.
Here you go,
mama, the boy is feeling shy.
We thought he was tired.
Mama, you make her be quiet.
Tell her not to interfere in my matters.
Okay come on, go to sleep.
I know you are tired. Go.
Watch now.
Watch, mama.
This shot is really easy.
I will try one more time.
No, no, you don’t get two turns.
Mama, she is cheating.
Why is he coming back in our lives
after so long?
I put a stone on my heart,
when Rania finds out
her father is alive,
will she be able to put
a stone on her heart?
The way she talked about
her father yesterday,
I feel she will forgive him.
Sister,
why do you worry?
It is possible that is written in fate.
But I will not forgive him.
Usman.
Usman, listen to me.
Don’t do this.
If not me, then care about your daughter.
Look, if you leave us and go,
then the world will kill us in our life.
Then make your uncle understand this.
He too should know
the result of a forced marriage.
From today, you and your child
are their responsibility.
And if this child asks, then tell her
that her father is dead.
Don’t do that, Usman.
Don’t do that.
This is our daughter,
she is both our responsibility,
don’t do that.
Leave me,
I said leave me.
You want to make this girl
the shackles of my leg,
and I won’t let that happen.
Leave me.
No, no, listen to me.
I won’t let you go.
Don’t go Usman.
Don’t go Usman.
Don’t go.
Don’t go leaving us, Usman.
Don’t cry, Rania.
I promise you child,
from today
I am your mother and father.
Usman is dead.
He is dead.
He is dead for my Rania.
Hey wow,
you can also ride a bike.
It is surprising.
Good.
Oh, you too can ride a bike.
It is surprising.
Hah,
I was really praising you with my heart.
How are you?
A-one, you tell me.
All good.
I was waiting for you since morning.
Let me meet Rabail.
Why?
I mean just like that.
She is a really good girl, that is why.
She is really good, everyone likes her.
Hey, I didn’t mean that.
She is good.
I was saying that,
I am in love with her.
Love?
Yes.
Go. Go.
I know the love of you loafers well.
I don’t trust you.
Hey,
what sort of cruel girl are you?
I hadn’t even imagined that
you could be so cruel.
I can be a lot crueller than this.
Huh?
Have you forgotten,
I made you my sister.
A brother is in trouble and
you won’t even help him?
I need your help.
Sister!
Oh yes, bro. I just remembered.
Yes. Yes.
Yes. I need your help.
I will have to think about it.
But I will tell you something.
If you are involving me, then
I will make this story reach the end
and if child, you lose your path,
get scared or run away,
then this sister will break your legs.
Understand?
Okay.
Bye bro.
Bye.
Don’t forget.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
Brother.
Go ahead.
What is the dish that
doesn’t require onions?
This one has made me cry like crazy.
The maids don’t come home,
like we will eat them.
Hey. Oh.
Oh.
Ouch. Oh damn it,
if the maid isn’t coming,
then work yourself.
Everyday I slip and fall
on the sofa or on the floor.
I don’t have the courage to get
my bones broken in this age.
Oh my back. Oh,
what happened to you?
I am alive. I am safe.
I have not died that you are crying.
Hey papa, I am not crying
cause you feel,
this onion has me crying.
Oh,
son, Arbab.
Son, listen to me.
Both maids have quit the job and
went saying there is no woman at home.
We cannot work in a home
that has just three men.
I know, papa
Then what have you thought, son?
We will keep a mail servant,
I cannot plead to the servants daily.
Hey idiot,
you can please to your wife, right?
Not at all.
I can beg a servant that madam
for God’s sake work in our home,
but not there.
Khawar, do you hear him?
He is in the mood to get me insulted
in front of sister.
What will she think about us?
That we are such misers and cheap.
We started sweating when asked to put
a little wealth in the daughter in law’s name.
Tell them that this home has
no worth in our eyes,
we are really rich.
It doesn’t matter to me
what your sister says.
I don’t want a wife that loves money.
Hey Khawar, make him understand.
In fact, leave it.
You get ready,
the two of us will get Saman.
Yes.
Hey, no papa, leave it today.
Lets wait for a day or two,
I will make him understand,
I will convince him.
Okay fine,
then make tea for me, quickly.
Hey…
Chop the onions at least, papa.
Why did you bring me
to their home?
You should meet up with the neighbour,
you always tired girl.
And Laiba came back
from the hospital,
now is it your responsibility
to ask how she is, or not?
Yes, that is fine, but…
Am I dreaming?
Ouch.
You are not dreaming,
it is the reality.
The thing is that Rania Ahmad turns
dreams into reality, Mr. Neighbour.
This means you have done
another favour on my life.
What favour?
Tell her,
what favour are you talking about?
I will tell you.
I will tell you.
First you come inside,
we will talk.
I…
we just came to meet Laiba,
right? so…
Oh,
I wish I was admitted in the hospital
instead of Laiba,
so you would have come to ask how I was.
You would have come, right?
No issue. Get run over by a truck,
we will come daily to find out
how you are. For sure.
You talk a lot man.
You come in.
Come in.
