Oh no, and to be honest,
I've learned to smile from you.
From me?
How?
Now I can casually talk to people,
make casual conversations,
smile and laugh.
You'll learn everything in near future.
Oh and they'll be getting married soon,
you have to come okay?
Oh I didn't introduce.
This is Rabail, my cousin.
And you've met Farhad,
and you know Laiba very well
she was your patient.
Laiba? How are you now?
I'm perfectly fine.
But I miss your scolding.
Okay so I'll meet you guys later,
take care.
Yes, bye.
This person is the father of Dr. Wasiq?
He's a doppelganger of my father.
Hello?
Where, where are you lost?
Nowhere, nowhere.
Can we go home now?
We'll have the ice cream
on the way back home.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
Mother, I don’t know where did I lose
the passport I cannot find it,
but I'm trying my beloved mother.
As soon as I find my passport,
I'll book the tickets
and land on your feet.
No, no, no, no, no bands or music.
There is no need for drums or bands.
Dabeer.
Here we go.
Yes Madam Sweetie,
today you've returned so soon?
Who were you talking to? Tell me.
What do you mean by who?
I only have a mother,
I was talking to my mother.
My mother, my mother.
Dabeer, everyone has only one mother,
but yours is equal to 100.
This woman couldn't learn English
for 30 years.
What are you trying to speak without
the volume? Speak up.
Get me my passport.
Oh so you finally said it out loud,
the cat is out of the bag,
you want the passport?
That's your mother, the one you have been
secretly talking to,
the one who has been asking you
to return for 20 years?
You want passport?
Do not make me angry.
If I get angry, I'll kick you out of the house
in this cold, you'll freeze.
No, Madam Sweetie,
I'm already shivering.
You know already how cold I get.
No, no, no, no, you're joking, right?
I'm not joking, I'll make it happen,
I'm going to open the door.
That's also a joke, right?
No, no, I'll make it true today,
get away.
Come on doctor, come on.
Have a seat.
Greetings.
Doctor, it looks like the patient
was waiting for you.
Hello Mahir, how are you?
Where did he come from?
Yes, I'm fine.
Let me get some tea for you.
Oh no, there is no need for that,
let it be, have a seat.
No, no, there is a need, that's why.
I'll just be back.
Injury is, this leg or?
Oh this leg.
Oh it's here man.
Okay sorry.
It's on this one?
Sorry.
Well, I haven't seen your cousin around?
Doctor, I am your patient,
not my cousin.
Forget about her and examine me.
It seems like, the injury has negatively
impacted his temperament.
It will be fine, okay?
Don't worry,
everything will be fine.
Don't worry doctor,
nothing happened to his temperament
it has been like this forever.
Exactly like a bitter gourd.
Rania told me.
What, what, what, what?
Rania has been telling all this?
Oh no, she used different words
but they implied the same meanings.
She didn't tell you anything
about herself?
If I'm like a bitter gourd,
she's not like honey either.
Oh, oh, oh, you both recently fought?
Well, the fights between
the lovers are so much fun.
I wish to get into such fights.
Well, let Rania know that I'm here,
so I could meet her as well.
She has an amazing personality.
Your amazing personality is not at home doctor,
she has gone too far and she'll return very late.
If you want to meet someone else, some uncles,
do you want me to call them for you?
No, no, please calm down, calm down,
why are you getting angry?
Nurse I think his blood pressure
is getting high.
I think we should check his
blood pressure first of all.
We'll also check your temperature.
Doctor, how is he?
Mother, apart from his mood,
everything is fine.
Okay, now I want to tell you
that next Friday,
my granddaughter is getting engaged,
you both are invited.
Grandmother that is our private event,
only family members are invited
so we'll invite them sometime else.
He is also our family doctor,
he has to come.
Who else leave their patients at the hospital
to check someone at home?
You are right, we will definitely come now
that you're insisting.
Right?
Okay now come on the tea is served.
Come on, have some tea.
Come on.
Bag?
Come on, start preparations.
A wedding will take place.
Who's getting married, uncle?
Sister's granddaughter Rabail?
Rabail is getting married.
She was telling that our Rania is in the front line,
making all the arrangements.
She was telling me that we're only going
for a simple engagement now.
Later we'll have a grand wedding.
All of you will be invited,
then we will go.
No, no, uncle.
I really want to meet Rania.
You can join later at the wedding,
I'll go now.
Bebo? Why do you lose
your mind like this?
We'll go to the wedding together.
No I cannot wait any more,
I want to go now.
Let her go uncle,
she really wants to go
and Rania will also be delighted
to see her.
Okay then go.
Really?
Thank you, uncle,
I love you so much.
Here we go, haven't even reached
Lahore yet,
and already you're speaking English.
Call and inform Rania.
No, no.
Nobody is going to tell Rania,
I'll surprise her.
Okay, that's also good.
What happened?
What's the purpose of this corner meeting,
what's the meaning, what's the agenda?
Why did you call me here?
I am going.
Hey, let me tell you.
The agenda is,
that we want to include you in our team.
Because the more votes we get,
the more the chances for succeeding, right?
Thank God, for the first time
she said something smart, good.
Uncle, it's simple,
we don't want that lizard-like khawar
to be a son and law of this house.
Son, It won't matter
what you want or don't.
All of this is decided.
We've compelled him to say no
to this wedding, by pressuring him.
When you've already done all this,
then what do you want from me?
I don't know,
she brought you here.
I told her,
what if you go and tell this to our aunt?
And she went to tell the grandmother.
Our secret will be out before time.
Why would he tell anyone?
Our uncle is not a tattletale.
Or someone crazy, or wife's servant,
who'd tell anyone.
Right uncle?
This child is absolutely right,
I'm not a tattletale,
wife's servant, or crazy who'd tell
everyone or tell his wife.
She's right.
Oh wow.
Okay now listen to me.
Wait a minute,
there's tell something left to say?
A whole movie is remaining my friend.
Okay so the situation is Khawar
agreed to say no,
but he's scared of our grandmother
and his father.
So now all we have to do is,
not invest anything and
get the best results.
Meaning?
Don't ask me the meaning,
I've hardly learned the line.
It means, to get our way without
anyone finding out.
Yes.
This girl is clever as a fox.
Right uncle?
Never got arrogant about it.
And what's this clever?
You could have called me intelligent.
But those are the words
people with low IQ use.
Okay well.
Grandmother is free at the moment,
I think it's the best time to talk to her.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on uncle.
Come on.
I have asked you a thousand times
why are you going back Mona?
Because it really doesn't matter if I stay here,
that's why I am going back.
You are not going anywhere.
Till the day mother announces
your engagement
with Mahir on top of her lungs.
You can't go anywhere.
I can't live in this delusion anymore.
I'm not wasting any more time
in these false hopes.
Because Mahir clearly said no to me.
And that Parvez got engaged
to someone in the village.
And the other one?
He's also involved with another girl.
If I don't go back in time,
I will lose all the other boys too.
That's why I am not going to waste
my time in this delusion.
That's why please spare me, I'm going,
your Mahir has a lot of attitudes.
Forget everyone else,
but tell me.
Mahir said no to you and only now
you're telling this to me?
It is not a good news that
I should have given you earlier.
Whatever,
I've told Parvez that
I'm coming back.
First we'll get engaged then
he will marry me.
And till then, he should stay away
from all the other girls.
What's with you,
you will get married to the Romeo
of that neighborhood,
but my whole plan failed.
Why do you want all my boys to run away
just for the sake of your plan?
Hey?
This packing?
Are you going somewhere?
Yes, my innocent sister is going back
after being disappointed.
Why?
There is nothing like that,
I am just going back.
Then don't go back yet,
attend my engagement first,
then you can go.
Yes, Mona, you're not going
anywhere till the event.
What if something impossible happens?
Aren't you my sister?
Please, Mona.
Just say yes, say yes, yes.
Your elder sister is asking you,
please say yes.
Yes.
Khawar was roaming wandering
in a park holding s girl's hand?
I can't believe this.
Uncle couldn't believe this
either but then.
Uncle, tell her how are you believed,
think about it.
How did I believe? I don't know.
I can't remember it.
He forgot about it, he has a disease
of forgetting things.
You told me by yourself
that when you went near them,
Khawar ran away, scared.
I remember it now, you did well
by reminding me on time.
I have this disease from childhood
that I forget everything that I memorize,
right mother?
Yes, grandmother,
even I saw him.
At a restaurant, with a girl, yes.
When?
You were bedridden for days.
His friend texted, grandmother.
Mahir received a message
from his friend,
he sent a picture of a boy and a girl.
And there was also a message.
And when Mahir saw that picture?
Yes, grandmother, grandmother,
when I saw the picture,
I lost my senses.
It was him, in the picture,
it was that Khawar.
Brother-in-law, I mean,
brother-in-law to be.
Mahir's condition after seeing
that picture, grandmother.
Mahir started crying when
he thought about his sister's sorrow.
Mahir, show grandmother,
how you cried.
God, my child's fate.
Well, it isn't so late grandmother.
I'd suggest, calling them right now
and cancelling the engagement.
That's the problem,
respected people do not go
against their word.
We have to keep our word.
Now look, one of our girls is married
to that family,
if we say no to this,
her life will be a tornado.
And if we tell Rafique,
then Khawar will deny it.
And then Saman's father-in-law will think
I'm taking out the old quarrel.
Oh God, what will happen to my child?
I see.
Mother, don't worry,
don't take the stress.
Everything will be alright,
Rania will manage everything,
right Rania?
Yes.
Grandmother, me, a delicate soul,
how many things will I manage on my own?
I think we should all try our best.
How happy I was,
such a great son-in-law
I'll be getting.
Who won't even look us in the eye,
you'll respect us.
How cunning he actually is.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's exactly what I was telling you earlier,
grandmother.
That he does not deserve my sister.
Where are you going?
To tell that cunning unfortunate
to just say no confidently,
I solved the problem on grandmother's side.
Mister, can you please solve
the problem of our land?
It'll be solved,
I talked to a registrar about it,
but you know such matters take time.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Asma, where are you returning from?
With so many things?
Aunt, I'm preparing to go to Lahore.
Here we go, I told a boy's family
that you're here.
And you're preparing to leave.
Hey bebo, remember that doctor?
Who sent the marriage proposal?
Which one?
The one who mistakenly gave his wife
the wrong injection.
That veterinary doctor?
He's alive again?
A doctor is a doctor, whether it’s
for humans or for animals.
He didn't give her the wrong injection,
it was the nurse.
She gave his wife the wrong injection
out of jealousy.
Whatever,
he has already sent a proposal once
and I've rejected it.
And only an animal's doctor left
for me now?
Bebo, listen to me,
is it necessary to pick cons
in all the proposals?
You said the same thing earlier
and rejected.
Getting married is also important,
you'll end up alone like this.
Then let it be.
Because I'm not staying here anyway.
And also I'm not interested
in that doctor in the stables.
But we're interested,
and we've called them,
and we'll talk to them.
Mister, it's a good thing,
you'll save a lot on milk expenses
after her relationship,
and he also has a business of eggs.
Nothing, have the tea.
Brother?
You're getting ready like
it's your engagement.
Yes it's mine.
What?
No, no, I mean doesn't matter who is getting
engaged, it's an engagement.
And also we should learn to be happy
in other's happiness.
I really don't want to go,
Farhad I made up my mind
after listening to you.
To make Rabail my daughter-in-law.
Hey.
You're getting late, come on fast.
Nice.
Mother, why are you not wearing a ring?
Where is the ring?
Hey, leave it, let it be.
How can I leave it?
Laiba?
So and get that round cut ring from inside.
Go, get it.
Didn't wear a ring.
Hey, we'll get late.
What if we reach there exactly
at the dinner time?
All eyes on us?
Then the food isn't swallowed,
it gets stuck here.
See, I understand your emotions,
don't get too sentimental.
Yes Laiba, here.
I don't understand why the videographers
at the wedding are only interested in one shot?
I mean if someone is taking out
more food,
is it necessary to make his video?
Okay now, come on.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Greetings aunt,
how are you?
Greetings.
Greetings, how are you?
Come on in.
Look how our Mano is looking.
Cute.
She's looking cute right?
Mano, look at sister Laiba's bangles,
they are beautiful right?
The boy's family has arrived.
The boy's family has arrived?
Greetings uncle.
Greetings my child, live long.
Welcome, welcome.
Greetings
Greetings, how are you, all good?
Greetings, live long, live long.
Greetings, welcome.
How are you?
Greetings.
Greetings sister.
Greetings.
What?
Recently learned to walk?
Intend to step somewhere and
ending up somewhere else?
How can you understand
my condition?
I feel like I'm going towards a warzone.
I'm really nervous.
Don't worry,
I've managed that as well.
I cannot believe you.
Believe her my child,
believe her.
You don't look so well?
Yes, that.
Khawar, Khawar, come forward.
Brother Khawar, come forward.
You're a special guest today,
you'll have to sit there.
And also it's such a happy day we'll
have double relations with this family.
Come, come, come, come.
Come on, sit here.
Take a seat.
He isn't going to deceive, right?
Listen to me,
if you cheat us, then.
You came here on your own feet
but you will return on 4 shoulders.
Understand?
Smile, smile.
Hey nephew,
I can see a lot of potential
on table number 8,
who are these people?
Keep in mind, you'll only say no.
Or it won't end well for you.
Rabail sent a message.
What?
That if you say yes,
then you’ll be the one responsible
for her death.
And she’ll write your name
on her suicide note.
People will look down on the whole family.
The hard-earned respect will turn to dust.
And if something happens to my sister
then you know what will happen
to you, right?
Smile.
Let’s take a picture.
I’m sure they’re the freeloaders.
Confirm freeloaders I’m telling you.
Have you seen him, anywhere else
when the weddings?
Here, ladies and gentlemen.
I didn’t introduce myself.
My name is Rafique Ahmed,
And from family background,
we were not the people who used to
do minimum wage work.
We’re wealthy for generations.
That’s why after my one son,
sister has decided to make my other son
part of her family as well.
I wish I didn’t care about the community,
I would’ve said no.
But being part of a respectable community,
my tongue is locked.
Mother, don’t worry,
Rania will make everything alright,
don’t take the stress.
If what Rania has said doesn’t happen,
then make arrangements for yourself.
You know I got a 1.5 tolah ring made
for my daughter-in-law.
With a real ruby engraved,
it’ll tell its value later.
So sister, call our child Rabail,
so I could give her something.
Two things that are rightfully her.
First this ring, second Khawar.
Then she is free to do whatever
she wants with the two of them.
Go, Seema, get her.
Sure.
Good luck.
Do you understand?
What do you think,
he is going to say no?
If God wills.
Come on, brother, let’s go.
Come on.
Come on sister.
Here you go my child Khawar,
give her the ring.
Father, no.
What? What brother Khawar?
What no?
What?
Grandmother? No.
Our brother-in-law is very humorous.
Say clearly brother-in-law, what no?
He’s being shy, my child is very shy.
Being shy about giving his bride the ring.
If his heaven-resident mother were alive,
she would’ve given this ring
to her daughter-in-law.
But no problem, I’m his father.
I can give this ring to my daughter-in-law.
Here my child,
give me your hand.
Do something, do something,
do something.
Uncle.
What are you doing uncle?
It doesn’t happen like this in rich
and elite families,
they consider it very inappropriate.
Yes.
Brother Khawar was saying something.
Brother Khawar, speak up.
What were you saying?
Speak up Khawar.
Say clearly, clearly.
I, am ending this relationship.
What are you saying Khawar?
How can you even think about this?
Leave it, Rafique Ahmed,
the matters of marriage aren’t a
game of dolls.
Agreements of our children are important,
we should listen to them.
And it’s good that he told us on time.
Well-done brother Khawar,
well done.
Enough, take this cartoon away
from my sight.
Or else.
Or else, what if I as a brother
get angry and I.
No.
No, Mahir.
Let go, let go of me.
No, no.
Uncle, I think you should leave now.
Go home and take some rest.
And give me your word, you won’t say
anything to this sweet brother of mine.
He probably likes someone else,
it’s okay.
Sister, why are you not angry?
I’m concerned.
Is this calm an indication of the storm?
No, Rafique Ahmed,
there is nothing like that.
Actually I’m a respectable woman,
so I understand the delicacy of relationships.
And also our child Saman is your
daughter-in-law, and she’s happy.
That’s all we care about.
You’re great sister, you’re great.
But this characterless son of mine
has turned my respect into dust
in front of you.
Now let us leave.
Yes, yes.
Come on, you shameless, come.
Bye.
Let’s go.
Bye.
Bye.
Careful brother, let it stop first.
Oh God, how sparkling it looks.
It’ll be so much fun.
Hey, hey sister, give me my fare,
I have to go somewhere else.
Oh God, what’s the problem?
Khawar, I didn’t expect this from you.
Father I didn’t expect this from me either.
Actually I really tried not to say no
but I got the strength and said it out loud.
I’ll tell you about this strength
as we reach home.
Drivers, bring all the cars.
Fast.
Grandmother.
My daughter, my Rabail.
Were about to get engaged.
It’d for the better,
it’s for the better.
People will make rumors,
they’ll draw conclusions.
How many people would we answer?
Grandmother who will marry me now?
Aunt, aunt,
it’s a great chance,
take advantage of it.
What are you thinking? This offer
is only limited for a few seconds.
Grandmother is very emotional right now.
She’ll agree on another proposal instantly.
What are you thinking? Don’t use
too much of your mind, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Start with the name of God.
Come.
No, no, don’t think like this.
Mother?
Yes?
I want to ask Rabail ’s hand
in marriage for my Farhad.
Believe us,
we won’t draw conclusions
nor will we taunt.
What?
How?
We don’t know you people, your cast,
or your background.
The ones who came forward to honor
our daughter in such a time
must be from a high background.
And then, our girl will be spared of
people’s taunts and pointless stories.
Think about it grandmother,
every second person will point
their finger at our girl.
They’d say, there must be
some probably with her,
that’s why even that
cartoon Khawar rejected her.
No, no.
Look at them,
those women are already gossiping,
grandmother, do something.
Okay look,
if you’re not satisfied with it then okay.
Oh, no, no, no, no, aunt,
what happened?
Actually we’re the girl’s family,
so a little hesitation is justified.
Because we could never find
a match better than Farhad.
Right, grandmother?
Grandmother, don’t think too much,
just make up your mind
and decide.
We can’t find a better match
than Farhad.
Grandmother, say something,
grandmother.
Speak up.
Say it, grandmother.
Say it, grandmother.
Speak up.
Grandmother.
I accept.
Play the music.
Thank you so much grandmother.
What are you people doing here?
You are not invited?
Rania is really nice,
she invited me right away to the event
of Rabail and Farhad.
And you’re relatives at least.
It’s okay if you weren’t invited,
follow me I’ll let you people in.
What did she just say?
Farhad and Rabail’s engagement?
Father, she’s stupid,
she just said some rubbish.
No, no, no, no, they’re still playing
the music inside.
We’ve left the engagement,
why are they still playing the songs?
Come let’s go and
see what’s happening.
Dabeer,
did someone die back in Pakistan?
A funeral?
If not pretty enough at least
say something nice.
What do you mean?
I was just saying Madam Sweetie,
that God has blessed you
with such a beautiful face,
use it to say something beautiful.
Oh, your tongue is working fine.
That means nobody died in Pakistan.
Then why do you seem so upset?
Leave that, tell me, where are you going
with so much makeup?
We only get one day off a weekend,
a person could spend that at home.
A person is sitting here to spend
the weekend at home.
I can’t do that, I get so many offers
for lunch and dinner.
Today my friend invited me
for dinner so I said yes.
Yes, why not, go ahead,
go with your friends.
Enjoy the life,
I’d suggest if any friend of yours asks you
to stay over for 3-4 days,
you can stay there for 3-4 days,
I don’t have any problem with that.
I am not one of those husbands
who think of their wives as their property.
A person should have properties to think
of their wife as a property.
Here, a freeloader got a landlady.
Okay listen, I’m going out,
lock all the doors and the windows,
it’s really cold outside.
If you get cold and catch pneumonia,
then I won’t spare you in the morning.
Don’t scare me.
Bye.
Go safely.
Thank God. The witch has left,
this woman scares the hell out of me.
Here we go, Dabeer,
this witch will return 3-4 hours later,
it’s the right opportunity to look for your passport,
where did she hide it?
But man my brain doesn’t work,
I should do this,
I should think like sweetie,
where could she hide?
That’s a good idea, Dabeer.
Okay then,
become Sweetie.
I look like sweetie.
Now I should look with sweetie’s mind,
where she must’ve hidden my passport.
Let’s see.
And tell me,
which ring should I give?
Mother, the one I gave you.
So that’s why you got me the ring.
