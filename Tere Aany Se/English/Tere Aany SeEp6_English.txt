If you have to bore me like this,
then don’t call me.
You have gone to your parents’ home
and stayed there for long.
You don’t care at all that there is no woman
in this home to take care of the home,
to take care of us.
And on top of that you want me
to talk to you happily,
I praise you for this selfishness of yours.
I swear you have become really selfish,
just like your grandma.
What did you say? What did you say?
You have once again disrespected
my grandmother.
Yes, so why doesn’t she make you
understand, man,
that go to your in-laws.
You fulfil our condition,
I will come.
What condition?
Wow, that’s great.
You have forgotten already.
This is the worth of what the wife and
grandma says in your eyes.
Okay,
so you are talking about getting
the property in your name, right?
Yes, so I am not greedy
for all your wealth,
at least put a small land
or home in my name.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Hey, what? She is talking, let her.
You have to interfere in everything.
You be quiet.
Hey Saman, one home,
two shops, this is nothing,
it is all yours. All yours.
Don’t try to fool me,
I know the dialogues of clever men
like you really well.
First you trap your wife in your love
and you don’t give her a penny
in the name of love.
Very good. Very good.
So this means you are not coming?
Yes, so fulfil my wish,
I will come today.
This is not your wish,
this is your mama’s wish,
that I will never fulfil,
because maybe she doesn’t know
that this wealth,
this land means nothing in the true love
of husband and wife.
For God’s sake,
think about what I said.
Okay?
Goodbye.
What happened?
What was he saying?
The home is empty without me,
it is really haphazard,
so he was missing me.
Hey, what did he say
about the property?
Is he naming it to you?
No.
Then fine,
there is no need for you
to go back there,
stay here.
Hey, why is there no need?
Sister Saman, that is your home,
you should surely go.
That is not Saman’s home,
it is Mr. Arbab’s home.
So who does Mr. Arbab belong to?
Sister Saman. Right?
Saman, you have seen the amazing feats
this girl has achieved with her thinking,
don’t focus on anything she says.
You won’t go there.
Why are you speaking in the matter
of husband and wife?
Sister Saman, he is creating misunderstandings
between you and your husband.
He doesn’t want to get married
himself, and neither
does he want anyone else to remain married.
I think he has a mental issue.
Hey, I am already really
upset with you,
don’t upset me further.
Go from here.
Saman, you won’t go anywhere.
Yes, here Mr. Mahir is waiting to put
all the property in your name,
wait to gather it.
What will Mr. Arbab give you?
You know, point to ponder, sister.
The demands you have put
in front of your husband,
if you put the same in front of
your sympathetic brother,
then you will see
what answer do you get.
Do think about what I said.
Saman.
Yes?
This girl is stupid.
Don’t pay attention
to anything she says.
This is no longer the issue
between you two.
It is our matter it is a matter of our home,
it is a matter of our respect.
And most importantly
it is a matter of aunt’s ego.
Till he doesn’t fulfil the requirements,
you are not going anywhere.
The wind is really fast today.
Rabail.
Yes?
All else is fine
but I was thinking we should
have a plant of jasmine here.
Yes, but we can also plant
another flower,
why a jasmine flower?
It looks really good.
The flowers are pure and white,
and the scent, oh man,
it touches the soul,
it refreshes a person.
I will talk to mama,
I will get a plant of jasmine here.
It will look really good.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
I am fine, how are you?
Thank God I got to see you.
Hey, at times I am inside the home,
sometimes outside, I don’t get to see you.
Visit our home for a change.
We live next door.
Yes, yes, I will come. I will.
I am just a little busy right now,
but I will visit soon
you talk so much.
Why don’t you talk? Are you fasting?
No, she is not fasting.
Then why don’t you speak?
Now, what can I say?
Rania is answering to every question,
so how can I speak?
I asked you a question,
I also want the answer from you.
Actually, I wanted salt, we have
run out of salt in our home.
Oh, salt.
We have a lot of salt at home.
Tell me, how much do you want?
I will go and get it.
Around, two spoons.
I will get it in two minutes.
I will get two spoons of salt soon.
Greetings sir,
I am Farhad.
I live next door.
Mahir.
This home is mine.
I mean, my own, personal
and all the people who live here,
their food, their expenses,
all their responsibility,
I am the guy.
Yes, yes, all our responsibility
is on his weak shoulders.
Oh..
What are you doing here?
I am introducing you nicely.
Salt.
Hey, thank you so much.
Had I not got this salt today,
then we would have had
to eat tasteless food.
I am surprised.
In our Khushalpur,
neighbours come to each other’s home
without hesitating, they eat freely.
Once I smell pulao,
I land at their home.
So cute.
You two go inside.
Grandma was asking about you.
Okay, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Is this your bike?
Yes.
There is sound in its silencer,
get it fixed.
I have a Hayabusa,
I am speaking about of experience.
Busa?
Oh hello,
wait.
Listen to me, frank neighbour.
What was this?
Are you on a mission to get us
insulted everywhere?
What would he be thinking about us?
The smell of pulao?
Quick neighbour.
I don’t know what.
I think I stepped on his tail again.
Sister.
Hey, sister.
What is it?
Sister Rabail has asked me to make tea,
should I make it for you too?
I don’t want it.
You go from here.
Don’t disturb me now.
Leave.
Fine.
Where was my hand?
Shehanshah, get tea and
two to three biscuits.
Huh?
Why are you standing here
like a sad pigeon?
Nothing,
I just don’t want to talk to anyone.
Yes,
when you hand over the management of
your life to these people with fake respect,
name and worth, this will happen.
Your life is ruined.
Ruined?
Yes.
 And he?
He will play music in the victory
of his fake pride.
And remember one thing,
in fact, I would say note it down,
this person will turn out
to be a wife’s pet.
How is that?
The boys who are arrogant,
they have a bad attitude
and show tantrums,
when their wife comes,
she fixes them.
Then they don’t remember any ego,
nor do they care about
the family’s name.
Tell me,
did you come to this home
on a mission?
Or have you been officially launched?
Hey, since you have come,
you are after me.
I didn’t even know you.
You are insulting me everywhere,
in front of everyone.
Oh God,
you get insulted really easily.
Poor me came on the mission
to get my admission.
Then get your admission done,
leave us alone.
I wont leave you alone
for the next two years.
The thing is, now that I have come,
I will leave after my masters.
After all, there is a long time
to the admission.
By the way, tell me something,
what have I done to you?
What have I done?
What have you done?
Hey, you are after me from day one.
I bought the bus ticket and
she snatched the seat.
I booked the taxi,
she went away in it.
And God knows who she was
forcefully getting me married to.
She went in front of the neighbours
and spoke nonsense,
she got my respect ruined
there as well,
and then she asks,
what have I done?
Sister Rania, you have shaken
the cores of this home.
You have been disrespecting
brother Mahir again and again.
Again and again.
In front of him,
not even mama says anything,
she listens to him quietly.
You turned out to be superman’s sister.
Wow, sister Rania,
wow, amazing.
Wow Rania, wow.
You turned out to be something great.
Right?
Applause.
Wow, you are really intelligent.
Wow, this is great, a single girl
dared to do so much.
This is great. Wow.
Hey, be quiet.
Silence.
I didn’t tell you all this to you people
so that you people praise her.
They are honest people,
they speak the truth,
they like the truth,
and you cannot keep them under your
pressure for a long time. Understand?
Oh, hello. Calm down.
You are a guest in our home,
only that’s why I am tolerating you,
or else I…
Really?
What? Or else what? Or else
what would you have done?
I would have squished you
between my fingers like this.
He paid the bus fare,
I took the seat.
He hired the cab,
and I escaped in it.
I was not your guest then,
what were you able to do, then?
Who are you threatening?
Grandma.
Grandma.
I will go complain to grandma,
and I will tell her
that even if idiots like this girl
get educated,
still nothing will change for them,
they will stay illiterate.
I will go talk to grandma right now,
I will get your bags packed and have you
sent away from here to your village.
Okay listen,
develop the courage to hear
the truth and face it.
It will be great for you, I swear.
Wow.
Well done.
You find it really funny.
You find it really funny?
Brother Mahir. Brother Mahir,
he is a child.
Why have you made
the environment so tense?
Such small quarrels happen in my life.
It is okay.
Chill.
Shahanshah, pour tea.
You come on.
All is fine, but I am worried cause of Saman.
What happened to Saman, mama?
Her centipede like father in law,
you know him, right?
Do you know what worth and
what position those people were in.
And now?
He starts talking about money
and ends it on money.
You are right, mama.
And us, who were from a rich family
have come to America,
in this cold weather and sighing.
We are working day and night,
putting in effort like donkeys.
I swear mama, look at my hands,
they are crooked,
their shape has changed.
Hey, why?
Has the shape of your hands
also turned like your feet?
Leave it, I know well how much hard work
you put in.
The sons that go from Pakistan
who go to America to work,
they send so much money that
they setup of grand palaces in Pakistan.
Then there is us,
the grand home we live in,
it was built selling the wealth
your father left us.
We hardly survive with
the money you send us.
Who are you talking to mama?
Uncle Naveed.
This is Rania,
your uncle Anwar’s grand daughter.
Okay. Okay.
How are you child? How is uncle?
Your uncle is fine.
Oh, but I…
what do I tell you about myself?
But if you are asking me,
I will tell you.
Hey, since I have come to this home,
I have gotten tired of getting insulted.
Insult?
Hey child, who can insult you?
Who has the courage?
Your son.
He considers himself the son
of a king and nor yours.
And he considers the whole family,
especially me his servant.
He orders everyone around,
all the time.
Now see, I am a guest,
I am here today,
I will leave in two years,
but this family,
my heart is really sad seeing them.
Mama, what is this I hear?
Hey, nothing.
You know both of them are smart
and they are also strong headed.
I will handle it.
You worry about sending money.
It is Mahir’s birthday on the first of
next month it is also Mahir’s birthday,
and you how big of
a function he arranges.
And then Saman is also over,
if not sooner or later,
she will go home.
I will not send her empty handed.
I will send her with so much that
Anwar’s father is left looking,
in fact, he will be left staring.
Yes. Yes. Yes, mama.
You are right. Absolutely right.
Okay, I will try then, mama.
Goodbye then.
Hey wait,
where is that queen of yours?
Huh?
Does she not have the time
to come and greet me?
Mama, I…I…I..I had to go to work,
mama.
I think she is ironing my clothes.
I will ask her.
Sweety,
are my clothes ironed?
She is ironing my clothes,
I will let you talk to her next time.
Okay goodbye. Bye.
Rania child, goodbye.
You don’t need to worry about anything,
I will talk to him well. How dare he?
Damn him.
Yes, you don’t worry.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Here you go, my work is done.
Look at that,
she is messing with the lion
staying in the jungle.
God be kind.
I will become like aunt Rania
when I grow up.
My love, don’t say this
in front of your brother Mahir,
or else all hell will break loose.
Yes, for no reason.
What is the matter?
Everyone is smiling.
I feel that you people are talking
about something special.
Guess what is so special?
Rabail’s marriage?
Oh sister, fear God, stop this marriage,
marriage, marriage, marriage.
Stop this marriage discussion.
Now you are after sister Rabail.
Don’t be sad,
his wife will come fix him.
Are we playing a game?
Yes.
Can I play too?
Yes.
Come sister, sit here.
Come. Come.
Hey. Hey, idiot.
You are asking me for so much
for your birthday.
You will feed my hard-earned money
to useless people, huh?
Hey, do I earn by unlawful means here?
This is the limit.
You just ask me to send you
dollars from here.
I am surprised. And that niece of mine
at home, Rania,
you threaten her?
Who? That Rania?
Dad, can someone threaten her?
Now you see yourself,
you are sitting so far from home,
and she called you and complained
about me falsely.
Hey, she didn’t tell me anything.
Stop it, dad.
Don’t try to cover up for her.
If she didn’t tell you,
then how did you find out?
Hey, I am your father.
Your father.
I am updated on whatever happens
their every moment.
What do you think of yourself?
That I won’t find out?
I know. I know everything.
Hey, listen to me carefully.
If in future you say anything to Raina,
then I will come straight to Pakistan,
I will beat you up, I will….
I am your father or
are you my father?
Okay. Okay, dad.
I accept what you are saying.
Now get my work done too.
Dad, I have so many friends,
and they are all asking for a treat.
Send some dollars.
Yes, celebrate your birthday.
If you don’t celebrate it,
then will I celebrate it.
Your father is alive,
had my father been alive,
I too would have been having a good time.
I too would have been having a good time.
Your father is alive,
you feed people.
Hey, invite them for my funeral,
feed them what I earn.
This is the limit.
I don’t have parents.
I have to work hard.
How much money do you want?
Oh, yes, thank you dad.
Thank you so much.
Bye.
She complained about me.
I will cook something good and
take it to the neighbours.
This way I will also get to meet them.
I only see lentils,
have we only cooked lentils?
Hey, lentils again, today?
Oh, Uncle?
Uncle!
what is this uncle?
We have lentils again at home.
I am telling you,
some learned man, has told mama
not to cook good food.
They are serving mutton
thrice a week at shrines.
At shrines.
My whole plan is ruined.
I had a great idea.
I was thinking that
I will keep it in a plate,
put a handkerchief on it.
What the hell will I take?
I will get insulted.
We have cooked lentils at home.
Last time I went to ask for salt,
this time chili.
No, not chili, it is a bad idea.
Tea leaf.
Yes, tea leaf.
Tea leaf is a good excuse.
I will go ask for tea,
they will say son,
why do you want tea leaf,
you come and have tea with us.
Yes, tea leaf is fine.
Hey, nephew, you are singing a lot.
Oh yes, to celebrate the hat-trick of lentils.
Because the homes in which the doors
of the home are closed on wedding functions,
in those homes a person can also celebrate
eating lentils three days in a row.
Dance.
Dance.
Hey, the menu in the jail has also changed,
you don’t even get lentils there.
Tea leaf.
Mama, the food is ready,
I have cooked it.
Tell the girls to make bread,
so that we eat quickly.
Where are the girls?
I don’t hear any noise.
Rania is teaching Rabail
how to ride a bike.
They are all gathered there.
Really?
You know, Rania is really brave.
She does it first,
thinks later.
Hey, see, the way Mahir is our beloved,
just like that she is her
grandfather’s beloved.
Oh, only her grandfather’s beloved?
Not her father’s?
Doesn’t he care for her?
She lives with her grandfather.
Doesn’t the father live with
the grandfather?
Does he live somewhere else?
Why?
Shehanshah, where are you?
Yes, mama, go ahead.
Go, tell the girls outside to come inside.
Is this the time for them to ride the bike.
Come and prepare bread,
Mahir too must be on his way.
Go.
Okay mama, I will go.
Listen,
ask Hamad to come to me,
I also have to lecture him.
Okay, mama.
She thinks highly of herself,
she doesn’t live with her father,
where is the father?
I will just tell you.
Oh God, your creation has a
small request,
the one who is going to meet,
make him meet her.
Ameen. Bell. Bell. Bell. Yes, Bell.
I pray to God, she comes.
She comes. She comes.
Where is she?
Yes?
Greetings, how are you?
Greetings. Yes, go ahead?
Are you home all day long? I mean,
don’t you come out anywhere?
You came to ask about this?
Hey, no, no, I was asking
this as your neighbour.
Actually, today we are out of tea left
in our home,
I really wanted to have tea.
If you can give me tea leaf, then…
Yes. Yes. I will just get the tea leaf.
She has such a dry temperament.
A person is saying they want tea leaf,
they feel like having tea,
you invite them in, but no.
Damn you Faraz,
you fell for such a girl.
Hey, Mr. Neighbour, you?
Did you ring the bell?
Yes, I did this stupidity.
Okay, so you were going to run away after
ringing the bell and I caught you, right?
I am a really smart girl, you cannot be saved
from me, you know!
Here you go.
What is this?
Tea leaf.
He came to get tea leaf,
and you gave it.
Well done, I am proud of such great,
smart citizens like you.
You come inside, I will make tea
for you and get it for you.
Come on. Come in.
Yes, sure, sure, sure.
I am sorry, it is your home.
Sorry. Sorry.
I was a little too happy.
Come in. Come in.
Sure. Sure.
Mama, I am running out of patience.
You have such a stupid
and useless son,
he knows nothing apart
from playing games on the mobile.
He does. He does.
He knows how to love,
he can insist to get married.
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
I had said that my son is lazy,
he is useless, he knows nothing.
But you didn’t listen.
I was your enemy back then.
Now suffer. Suffer. Suffer yourself,
don’t complain to me.
Mama, you too…
I had lost my mind back then.
A person makes mistakes.
Right now, give me money,
I have to go shopping.
Mama, look here,
give her money.
I swear, she treats me
so badly in the room,
I cannot tell you. I shed tears.
Die. Oh God,
you have defamed my entire family.
You shed tears.
Don’t say anything like this
in front of my Mahir,
my son has a lot of self-respect.
Oh my, may I die.
He shed tears. He shed tears.
Promise by God, we will come back
and listen to you praise Mahir.
Right now, give us money,
we are short on time.
Hey, do I have trees with
money growing on them?
You are always asking for money.
Freeloaders, useless people,
they come over just like that.
What happened to her?
Don’t worry,
these titles are not for you.
Yes, this is mama’s love,
she has not gotten upset.
This is love. If this is love,
then she must shoot bullets in her anger.
Try to upset her,
she is sitting right in front of you.
Just kidding. Come on,
come inside. Come inside.
Mama.
Mama, this innocent boy
is your neighbour.
Greetings.
Greetings.
How are you?
Hey didn’t you bother too soon?
Huh?
Meaning asking how neighbours is a custom,
but only people from good families
understand it.
And people nowadays inspired
by fashion know nothing of this.
Hey, we have been in this home
for two months, yes?
And during this time, we didn’t see
a single damned neighbour’s face.
Mama, they shifted here two weeks back
and they too have the same complaint
from her neighbours.
Mama, what is the order for us?
You too ask how the neighbour is,
how he is feeling?
Greetings Mr. Neighbour, how are you?
Are you fine? Are you feeling okay?
Do visit soon. Fine?
Yes, yes, absolutely,
it feels really homely here and this mama,
mama is just like my mama, really sweet.
She is a lovely woman.
We have the same liveliness in our home.
and I am this home’s and
mama’s lucky daughter in law.
And I have the responsibility
of the entire home on me.
Grocery and everything else.
We have so many expenses,
but we are from a good family
and we have good expenses,
and mama? Mama gives me money
for the grocery.
Mama has such a big heart.
You ask her for twenty thousand,
she gives you thirty thousand.
Wow, wow, wow.
Mama give me the money,
we are running out of time
for the grocery.
Okay, here you go.
Wallet. Okay fine, wallet.
One, two, three.
Here.
Come on, let’s go.
Thank you, mama.
And thank you very much,
you came at the right time.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
When children, dish,
they are of ten.
Shehanshah, it is not of ten,
it is often.
My ears hurt hearing your English.
Shehanshah,
make a cup of tea quickly.
Sister, can you not see,
I am studying English.
Shehanshah, please make a cup of tea.
Please make it quickly.
Mama has strictly told me
there is no need to do any work
in between my studies.
If I fail this time, she will take my
thirteen pro and sell it off.
Come on, go.
This boy doesn’t do
any work properly ever.
I have already been insulted so much.
Sister, I am making tea,
you quickly fry kebabs.
Why? Do we have any guests over?
My in-laws?
Not at all.
Those poor people will come here after
they put bandages on their old wounds.
What do you mean?
Meaning that the servants of this home
is much more than your in-laws.
I don’t know what I am talking about.
I am making tea,
you please quickly fry kebabs.
The neighbours from next door are here.
Hmmm.
What is your name and what do you do?
My name is Faraz.
I am a student, I am studying law.
I have a bright future.
Mama, I feel that he is smart just like me.
You have knowledge of the unknown?
Unknown? No.
Then how do you know
you have a bright future?
We have seen many people with
degrees going around aimlessly.
Oh man,
you are just like my grandma.
She too is like this.
She is out spoken like you,
I mean, she insults really badly.
I have a request from you,
give me permission
to come to your home.
This way, I will keep on looking at you
and feasting my eyes.
Please.
You have my permission.
We have a grand temperament
and open heart
We have no issues with guests.
Even if 100 people come over,
we don’t care.
Just stay great like this.
Life will be made.
Whose?
Mine, I mean, how much is left?
Oh.
So what does your father do?
Nothing.
Huh?
Rania, I feel that in the neighbours there is also
a fashion of breaking beds just like our home.
Yes, mama it feels that way.
Hey, no, no, mama.
Actually, my father passed away,
so what do I tell you?
He is not in the world,
so what will he do?
And what is your family background?
I don’t know.
I mean, I don’t know about it,
but my mama knows.
My mama is a working woman,
she is really educated.
When you meet her, you will really like it.
The neighbours are not as per our standard.
When the boy doesn’t know of his ancestors,
hey, if they had done something great,
then the mother would have told them.
Right. Absolutely right, mama.
You have tea now.
Yes. Yes.
Go ahead, have tea.
Can I get water?
Sure.
Daughter.
Yes, mama?
You call home, right?
Yes. Yes.
I talk to them 10 times in the day.
Oh God.
Don’t worry, I have praised
everyone here a lot.
And I have also said that
everyone really cares for me.
Really?
Yes,
and the family aside, even
the neighbours miss me a lot.
Oh, that’s good.
Yes, yes, you people don’t worry
about anything. I am here.
All the arrangements have been made.
One second. Hold on for a second.
Grandma, I gave you my charger,
where is it?
It is there.
It is there, okay?
Yes. Yes, invite as many guests as you want,
invite the whole class.
It is Mahir’s birthday. Restaurant?
Hey, I got a booking in a five star hotel
as per my standard.
Yes, yes, invite everyone.
Invite them. No problem.
Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
Expenses all the time.
Birthday.
God knows who he did a favour to,
getting born.
Oh mama, very good news.
My Mona is coming.
Really?
She too will be there on Mahir’s birthday.
I will inform her,
to get ready well.
Grandma,
now why is this Mona giving
an entry in our home?
She is her sister.
She is coming to meet her sister.
You are mistaken that
she is coming in her love.
You don’t know,
she is a big drama.
After all, grandma,
do we not have enough
useless people in this home,
that this Mona will come as well?
Useless?
Who did you call useless?
Hey…
Mama, did you hear
what he is calling me.
I have had enough,
call uncle Naveed right now,
I too will tell him that God knows why
his son considers himself a prince.
Call? Why?
How is he talking about me?
Rania, child, you stop being upset,
stop it.
No mama, today I will make sure
I talk to uncle Naveed.
Why are you standing quietly?
Say sorry.
I? I say sorry to her?
Yes, say sorry. She is the attachment
of my parents’ home and…
and your only granddaughter
of your only brother,
she is the heir of the home,
she has come to make our home lively.
And we see how well
she has made this home lively.
Really?
Now I understand, mama,
actually, he is jealous of me.
Mama, did you not tell her,
explain to him,
that the one who is jealous
only face loss themselves.
It is my heart that is soft,
I don’t want that your son burns
to ashes in his jealousy.
Me?
Grandma, I will be jealous of her?
Yes, you are jealous of me,
and you don’t even know,
let me become prime minister once,
then he is a goner.
What?
Prime minister?
Grandma,
she will become the prime minister?
Prime Minister.
Grandma, if she becomes
the prime minister,
then the whole world will give us
donations themselves.
Pakistan will progress a lot.
Okay, the food is served,
just have food.
And please don’t make
so many stories again,
he has a stomach ache
cause of laughter.
Grandma, the prime minister’s protocol
is coming on a cycle.
What if someday the wind blows fast,
and the prime minister flies away.
Stop it.
You will get unwell,
stop laughing.
Hey, what did your mother say to you?
That you don’t have to talk about
the prime minister, in front of others.
People laugh then.
They are stupid.
They laugh, that is why they cannot
become the prime minister. Idiots.
It slipped my tongue,
and so what if I said it?
Can I not become the prime minister?
What do I lack?
Yes, my beloved,
what do you lack?
What are you saying?
No. No. See,
you can become what you want.
Mahir doesn’t know you,
we do.
That is why I am telling you that
you keep your plan to yourself.
Yes,
you know I can even get
an evil eye like this Mian Jee.
You are right.
Okay tell me,
has my mark sheet arrived?
Yes, it has arrived.
You think I will send it
to you in a day or two.
You know I was thinking
that I too come to Lahore there,
and I will get you admitted
and come back.
Hey, no, no,
how will you come to the city?
You have a lot of work there anyway.
Believe me,
I will do everything here myself.
Don’t worry. Okay?
Hey Rani, we believe you,
that is why we sent you so far.
Had we not believed in you then
we would have made you stay at home.
I came to find out if this is their home or not.
Someone is standing there.
Excuse me.
Is this Mahir’s home?
Yes. Yes. 
This is her home.
You? Mona.
 Are you Mona?
None of us is Mona,
we are Mahir’s friends and since
he shifted we came for the first time.
Oh, then you have come
to the right home.
Come on, come inside.
Mahir has two more friends too,
should I call them?
Yes, yes, you surprise me, when they can come,
then why can’t they come?
Salik. Jahanzaib.
Here we are.
Which amongst them is Salik?
Yes, I am Salik.
I am Ifrah and this is Tania.
Hey, Ifrah.
You have no idea,
how much I wanted to meet you.
You know me?
Didn’t Mahir tell you?
Hey because of you we had such
a big scene in our home.
And your friend. Mr. Mahir,
he almost got caught up
in such a big misunderstanding.
Mahir didn’t tell me all this.
he didn’t tell you? So what?
I will tell you. I am here.
Come on. Come on.
Lets go inside.
Come on. Come on.
You people also come.
Come on, come in.
Come in. Come in.
Shehanshah.
Shahenshah.
Go call your sir Mahir,
his friends are here.
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Come on.
You people come sit comfortably.
Right now, Mahir will wake up,
he will take out his branded clothes,
get them ironed, wear them and come.
By the way, you are his friends,
why don’t you make him understand?
Hey, for a friend a friend is dear,
not his branded clothes.
Er…
you are right, but…
Hi guys, what’s up?
Hey you people had come over,
you should have told me earlier.
I would have come sooner.
How are you?
Buddy, we thought
we would surprise you,
but you are dressed up in a way
that maybe you are going somewhere.
Hey, this is my swag.
I stay this way at home too.
With style.
What are you doing standing here?
We have guests over,
make arrangements for tea for them.
Sure.
Go.
Who is this girl? Is she a relative?
Relative?
Hey, she is my servant,
she works at home.
She and my relative?
I am not going through such a bad time.
Hey, to be my relative,
a person should have class,
they should have some standard.
