I wasn't there,
who took care of grandfather?
Don't worry Rania,
God is great,
he's aware of every pain we have,
my brother's son came back,
he'll take care of him.
Sons are like arms for fathers,
their brilliance and their hope.
Now you'll see,
my Anwar will have different mannerisms.
What are you talking about grandmother?
Daughter Rania, I want to tell you a story,
it's a long story
but you have to hear it with patience.
Grandmother,
you're seeing her poor condition,
she's not in the situation
to hear a story.
You just drive the car,
don't say anything,
instead you should think about Sweetie
and what to do with her.
I'm running out of patience with her I'll ask
Dabeer to send her back to America.
You were telling me something
grandmother.
Rania
I want to tell you that,
your father,
Anwar's son,
he's alive and well.
And he's at Anwar's home.
What are you saying, grandmother?
My father?
Yes my child,
your father is alive and well.
He just made a really big mistake
that he left everyone behind chasing
after his dreams.
But he must've realized
that even after getting everything
he's empty-handed,
because his people are far away
from him.
No,
how is this possible?
I cannot accept this,
how can someone do this?
How can someone be so selfish
that he leaves his blood relations
for the sake of wealth?
Grandmother,
I feel strange to hear this,
a man can leave his father,
his wife, his sister,
and even his own child for the sake of
wealth and luxury.
That means not even a single relationship
could hold him back?
How can someone forgive
a man like this?
I cannot forgive him, no.
But grandmother,
there is something to think about,
why did they lie to Rania?
There are a lot of fathers
who walk away from their families
then why did they tell her
that her father isn't alive.
His son's disobedience crushed Anwar,
so he declared his living son dead,
because he was really angry
and he decided he won't even
look at his son's face.
He must've thought
he should protect Rania
from this agony,
who'll be living her life without a father
even when her father is alive.
I can still feel that agony today,
it would've been better if they had
just told me the truth.
Why am I tested like this
for no reason?
Life is a name of tests and trials,
you're fortunate that you're a grandchild
to someone like Anwar,
who never let you feel the absence.
My child, not you
but your grandfather needs a support.
Your mother and your aunt forgave
your father with a big heart,
your grandfather opened the door of
his heart and his house for his son,
and now you want to push him
back to sadness
and disappointment again
with your reactions.
You're a child,
you don't understand the demands
of the times and situations.
Whatever decision your elders made,
listen to it quietly and accept it.
My child I understand
it's not easy for you
but you have to accept the reality
for the sake of your grandfather.
It's not like your father didn't try to come
and apologize in past years,
he came
but now he got forgiveness.
Come on my child,
forgive your father with a big heart,
humans make mistakes.
Mahir why did you stop the car? Drive,
we have to reach there on time,
Anwar must be waiting
for his granddaughter,
let's go.
Yes.
Thanks a ton to God
that father's condition is
a little better now.
Asia,
have you really forgiven me Asia?
And my daughter?
Will she forgive me too?
I don't know,
I talked to the sister, she's coming
so you can ask by yourself.
Thanks a million to you my Creator,
I'm really restless to meet my daughter.
Well Zaman,
didn't you think about it
a little too late?
You throw me and my daughter aside
while leaving,
if it weren't for uncle,
we would've jumped in a river.
Asia,
I made a big mistake.
My daughter and I bore
the consequences of that mistake.
I also bore the consequences
of that mistake,
I'll explain everything
when we'll have time.
Then do the reckoning,
who was at loss.
Zaman,
you reaped what you sow,
my daughter and I were punished
for the crime we didn't commit.
I'll do anything to make up
for that mistake.
I promise you
I won't let any worry or
sorrow come near you.
Let it be,
all your attempts will be nullified,
but I've forgiven you by moving past
all your mistakes,
just don't expect anything else from me.
Greetings.
Greetings greetings.
Won't you meet grandfather?
How is my brother?
He's better than before.
Come on.
Rani,
Rani
I'm seeing you back at home
after such a long time.
Father is only waiting for you,
if not for yourself then forgive my brother
for the sake of father.
Rania,
let's go inside,
father and brother are waiting for you.
But I'm not waiting for anyone,
I don't want to meet anyone,
please leave me alone for a while.
Come on.
Where is my brother Anwar?
Where is he, where is my brother?
Hey whose evil eye affected him?
That my brother is bedridden.
Greetings.
Greetings.
How are you my child,
how is my brother?
Better.
Okay okay.
Greetings Aunt.
Zaman, live long my child,
live long.
You're fine? How are you?
I'm alright,
what could happen to
an unfortunate like me.
You're fortunate that you came back home
before the evening.
To be honest I was mad at you
but if my brother has forgiven you
then I've forgiven you as well.
And this is, my grandson Mahir,
son of Dabeer.
Aunt, tell me, my daughter didn't come?
She did,
but she's sitting outside,
she's upset to know about your arrival.
I'll see.
Aunt come, take a seat.
He's that, doctor's father,
which means Dr. Wasiq
is Rania's stepbrother?
That's what we call
a beautiful coincidence.
Bebo, Bebo, Bebo,
he's your biological brother?
Yes.
He's Rania's father? Biological father.
Yes.
Thanks to God.
The happiness I got by
meeting him today,
I can't even describe.
Hey, Rania,
what are you doing here?
I was.
That means,
you are my daughter.
Rania, this is Dr. Wasiq's father.
Hey, father, this is Rania,
she agreed to come on my one call,
on my request.
She decorated the whole ward,
in fact, helping me keep children happy
and making them smile.
You're doing a great job.
Because only the people who spread
happiness deserves to be called human.
You're definitely a great girl,
your parents taught you well.
My child.
Don't say anything,
I won't hear a word.
If I knew
you are my father
who came alive,
I would have never met you
nor would I come here.
My child, listen to me.
I've heard everything you have to say,
now I have realized,
I don't have what it takes
to forgive you.
Rania.
Mahir, Mahir I have to go back,
I can't stay here please take me back.
Please hold yourself.
No I can't stay here why don't you understand,
please take me back.
Okay okay, we'll go back,
you just came here,
go and meet your grandfather.
No, I don't want to meet anyone,
please.
Please take me back.
Okay okay, you call yourself strong,
then prove that,
please contain yourself,
go and meet your grandfather,
go.
She is going through a very
difficult phase in her life,
give her some time and
she will be fine.
Rani,
Rani get up.
Why did everyone tell me
that my father is dead?
What else we could have said?
The person who breaks all the ties
with their family,
that person dies.
How can you say that
we that wrong Rani?
When I believed he died then
how can I accept that he's alive?
You didn't do right by me,
you people cannot understand
what I am going through,
you people can never understand.
Only I know the condition of my heart,
nobody else knows.
Rani,
father is waiting for you,
he has forgiven my brother,
please don't say anything
that makes him worried again.
He's satisfied with the return of his son,
don't do anything to make
dissatisfaction his fate again.
Rania, we've forgiven him
for the sake of father,
we can't trouble him more
in this age and condition.
And I know you will understand
our situation.
Cap.
It's imported,
I've brought all this stuff
for you from America.
But it says "made in Sahiwal".
Yes, Sahiwal,
Sahiwal is a name of a city in America,
it was made there.
It must be very expensive.
Cap.
Perfume, with fragrance.
And now I'll give you the biggest gift.
Dollars.
For me?
Yes.
It's heavy must be real, sister,
you're sweet just like your name.
We'll count it later,
it'll take a week.
Brother, I'm really happy,
congrats to you on Zaman's return.
Now that your son is back,
you're not alone,
he'll be your support.
My child, come sit here, sit here.
Sister told you all the reality.
Yes.
Did you meet your father?
Yes,
I met him,
but nobody can take
your place grandfather,
you’re like a father to me
and grandfather as well.
Thanks to him that
he came to meet you,
we wouldn’t have died if didn’t come.
We’ve spent so much of our lives,
we could’ve spent the rest as well.
My child your resentment is justified,
then complain to him,
express your anger so he’ll know.
What complaint?
Resentment for what?
You spoilt me and you were the one
who fulfilled my dreams.
I wasn’t left empty that
I complain to him.
Your love always fulfilled me,
I have no complaints from anyone.
Okay then.
What do I tell you Salik,
the one I used to think of
as my enemy and rival,
ended up being my future brother-in-law.
Interesting, that’s a very filmy situation,
isn’t it?
I wish I were there too,
it would be fun.
Brother, you accepted or not,
all this help is from the God.
Well it was a very emotional scene,
poor Rania was very surprised
and shocked,
but my heart was dancing,
I wanted to dance to the music.
The danger I always had of Dr. Wasiq,
who could it be?
Rania’s elder step-brother.
That means my future brother-in-law.
Now that you’re my brother,
take this advice from me,
anyhow win the heart of your father-in-law,
then you’ll see the girl
will agree inevitably.
Currently my father-in-law is taking
his daughter’s resentment,
just let the matters settle for once
then you’ll see,
now I’ll impress uncle with my manners
and obedience.
But there is one problem.
What now?
Since the arrival of my step-mother,
I got poor,
and since the return of this uncle
Rania got rich.
I hope my poverty doesn’t make me
an unsuccessful lover.
No worries, there will be a solution
for that as well, don’t worry.
Sister, I told everyone that Madam Sweetie
invited everyone.
I don’t know what kind of people they are,
it’s morning already and they’re still sleeping.
They don’t have anything to do,
they’re very stubborn.
Sweetie, what fits you’re throwing
so early in the morning?
You could have used your mind,
it’s a day of everyone is resting.
You should also rest for God’s sake
and let us rest as well.
Listen to me
if your mother isn’t home
that doesn’t mean
the sun won’t rise on us,
nobody will wake up and
won’t do anything.
This is not happening.
Yes Sweetie?
Did you call?
Today is the day off so Mona and
I am taking the kids to the Zoo.
Why do you need to go to a zoo?
This house is a zoo itself,
just look at your face in the mirror
you will understand.
Now watch your faces later,
first of all, everyone makes a queue,
come on, stand in a straight line.
Dabeer.
Yes.
You too, go make a queue.
Yes, I’m going to make a queue.
Shehenshah, you didn’t hear that?
Get on, come on fast.
Shehenshah will stay here,
here you go have the juice.
Come on, madam.
You made a queue?
Make a queue.
Move aside.
Come on, come on fast.
Come, make a queue.
We’ve made a queue Sweetie.
Dabeer, from today onwards you’ll iron
all the clothes in this house,
do you understand?
And you, lazy person,
you’ll go get the groceries
for the house,
you’ll go right now and on foot, okay?
Seema, you’ll complete all the house chores
and exactly 2 hours,
not more, not less, exact 2 hours,
understand?
And you, go outside and
water the plants,
each plant in the garden
should be watered.
And you, imaginary princess,
go to the kitchen and
wash all the dirty dishes,
dishes from dinner last night
are still in the sink, go.
Excuse me, you don’t know who I am,
I am the only beautiful wife
of such a wealthy man,
if I wash the dishes it’ll be
an insult to my in-laws.
That’s going to happen or pack your bags
and go back to your real home,
and I’ll call your in-laws to tell them
that this alien has nothing to do with us,
do you understand?
Brother Dabeer,
you’re heading all this,
why are you not saying something?
Dabeer has got blisters in his mouth,
he won’t be able to speak,
do you understand?
And all of you, listen to me clearly,
I’ve seized mother-in-law’s place now,
and even mother-in-law herself
can’t get this back.
Do you all understand?
So it’s better for all of you
to behave well,
or I’ll make you better with
my own hands, understand?
And only the one who has been through
this can understand what it’s like, yes.
Dismissed.
She’s not the one
who could benefit anyone,
I made a big mistake,
I was persuading this arrogant woman
for no reason,
she’s an unkind woman, dangerous.
Let mother come back,
I’ll apologize for my treachery
and join mother’s group.
Dabeer?
Yes, yes, yes, Sweetie.
This seat has a lot of power,
and power has its own distinguished taste.
It might, Sweetie,
if you say so.
But I never had the taste of power
so how would I know?
Listen to me,
before your mother returns,
there has to be a golden nameplate with
my name outside this house, understood?
Oh hi, May I come in?
Do you need something?
No, there is nothing.
Then why did you come to my room?
Randomly, to see how you are doing,
is your anger still the same
or did it get better
That’s none of your problem,
you shouldn’t have come to my room.
Why, why is there a problem with that?
I mean what would he think of you
what would he think if he saw you here.
Oh,
that means what he thinks,
what his opinion is,
it matters to you.
Oh,
thank God,
which means your anger finally settled,
so the family was worried for no reason.
Wait, let me go and tell them.
No, wait,
don’t say anything to anyone.
I was angry then, I’m angry now.
Rania,
what good is the anger
that only harms you,
you should be happy instead that
your grandfather found his long-lost son
and see how he got better
since he met his son.
You don’t know anything,
you shouldn’t speak so much,
and getting angry is my right.
I also have feelings,
I also have a heart.
Well, can I say something?
It’s good that you didn’t become
the prime minister,
if you were you would be
the prime minister of children.
Dude, you’re just like a child,
very immature.
Why are you laughing so much,
and listen, don’t call me dude
or child here,
I already don’t like this informality,
do you understand?
Go away.
Okay, okay, okay, express
all the anger you want,
until you get out of this room,
I’m not going anywhere,
I’m here.
That,
he was here to convey
grandfather’s message,
he’s calling me so I should go.
Why are you lying?
What message did I bring?
She’s lying Bebo,
since the morning
she’s locked in this room,
I was worried for her,
if she got sick or something,
right dude?
Agian dude?
I told you to not use
this word for me.
Okay Rani,
what’s there to get angry about it?
You could say it calmly as well.
Leave it Bebo, let it be,
she’s getting angry at me,
let her do it,
and anyway a person
only gets angry at people
he thinks he has a right over.
Doesn’t matter Rania,
you have a right over me,
express your anger.
What right? Which right?
There is nothing like that running
in my mind, do you understand?
Bebo
I have decided that
I am going back to Lahore,
if mother and Mahir want to stay here
then they should.
Why would I stay here?
I am already getting bored here,
I’ll tell grandmother to stay here
as long as she wants,
Rania and I are going back to Lahore.
Go wash your face,
I am not going back with you,
I only came here with you because
I heard about grandfather’s condition.
But I won’t go back, do you understand?
Tell me one thing,
did your niece have some
electric shock in childhood?
Then why does the fuse of her brain
never work?
We try to say one thing,
she understands some other.
I can’t understand her.
Okay leave all this,
tell me what is your progress?
What do I say about the progress,
currently this girl isn’t even calling her
father her father.
What’s there to stress about it,
if she doesn’t want to call him father
then she can call him papa,
dad or pops,
what’s to worry about?
Dude the way you say senseless things
with so much confidence,
I hate it.
Okay okay,
why are you getting angry?
Look, listen to something important,
take advantage of the opportunity,
understanding?
Grandfather and her father,
make a place in their heart,
not heart, make a place in their minds.
Force them to think
that you are the boy
who can bring spring into the life
of their daughter.
Then let Rania show as much attitude
as she wants,
she won’t be able to get
away from you.
They say absolutely right,
dirty minds think alike,
I also had the same planning
in my mind,
that’s what I have to do.
At least you did something smart,
now take me to a dinner
at a nice restaurant,
you made a bet or two that you lost.
Really,
I did lose the bet,
but for the first time I’m happy to lose.
I am surprised about my condition.
Well-done, these are the symptoms
of true lovers my child.
We are the old players of this game
and we know all of this.
I don’t understand
how did I fall in love with her,
but I also get worried thinking
about one thing Salik.
What if Rania rejects me?
How can she reject you?
We won’t play the shallow game,
we’ll plan every move properly.
Just do one thing,
don’t say “I love you”
if you get emotional,
only focus on the family for now.
Okay, okay, okay,
teacher Salik Ali khan,
I’ll do exactly what you tell me.
Okay now don’t waste your time
grandfather and father,
butter them a little, look after them.
And think, if they’ll consider a stupid
like you for their only daughter?
What?
Stupid?
Who are you calling stupid?
I called you, you crazy,
who could be more stupid than you,
you went to make a girl
fall in love with you
and you yourself are diving
into the Oceans of love.
Hello?
Greetings Asma,
how are you?
How is your father’s condition now?
Yes, he’s better now, thank God.
Thank God, I was getting concerned
thinking about your worries.
It was good to hear
that my worries matter
that much to someone.
Asma, I’ve decided to make you
mine wholeheartedly,
I’ll walk beside you at every turn of life.
I swear.
If God wills, it’ll be like that.
Just, as soon as the situation gets better
then you can come here
along with your sister,
I’ll wait for you.
Really?
Okay, bye.
Bye.
