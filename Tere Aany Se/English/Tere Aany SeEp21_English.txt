Oh, Mona arrived, welcome,
welcome, welcome.
Stop this, leave it,
stop pretending to be happy.
Because I texted you an hour ago
to please pick me up,
but you did not even respond.
Where is your phone?
Do you even know how I got here,
I asked for a lift,
and that too, only because
I found up cute boy.
But yes the car was
so stinky I can't tell.
If my darling Khawar finds out about this,
do you know how angry he will be?
And if I had texted
my darling Khawar instead,
he would've reached there
with so many cars.
Mona's, don't be angry, please.
Don't be angry actually Mahir
took the car,
I texted him about it
but he probably didn't see.
I know, when there is only one car
in the house,
they have such problems often,
I really don't like it.
Thank God,
Khawar has many cars,
I won't be stressed about it.
Hey, Mona darling.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
I had been waiting for you,
good thing you're here.
Yes, I was going to come,
darling Khawar Insisted so much
that we'll shop when I'll be here.
Your choice of dresses,
shoes and a lot more,
also he said, whichever expensive dress
you choose I'll bring it to you.
By the grace of God,
my sister has such a beautiful fate.
Yes, no doubt.
I was after a stone,
but God blessed me with a big diamond.
My darling Khawar at one hand,
and useless people on the other.
Okay now come on, look at my shopping
then we'll talk about your love.
Come on.
Bye.
She called me so many names.
And you love to interrupt and
talk in everyone's matter,
but in my matter,
you didn't say a word.
We don't have a love story going on,
that you get called names
and I feel hurt.
Fight your own wars.
You're extremely insensitive.
Mother,
this time when brother return tells him
to set up a business for me as well.
Look at Mona,
how she was admiring her husband to be,
what's his name? Khawar.
And my wife, your daughter-in-law
gave me a nasty look,
I don't know what is going
to happen to me.
Whatever happens to you
is not enough.
Really?
Now go away.
No.
I'm watching TV, get away.
I made a mistake
I should have given Khawar's address
to those robbers.
They would have robbed him
of all his money.
It would have been fun.
You were eager to get out of there,
I was going to get
their contact numbers.
Yes you should have asked for
the numbers
and then should've joined them later.
Good idea.
You still have a chance, they might have
a page on Instagram, check it and follow them.
We will see.
Your dress looks really beautiful.
Thank you.
I heard brother Mahir brought you the dress.
He doesn't even give his fever to someone,
and he brought you a dress,
it's a big deal.
Is everything okay?
Yes, yes, everything alright.
If one of his relatives showed up to
such a grand event in some casual outfits.
It would have been embarrassing for him,
only that's why, there is no other reason.
Your brother is stingy.
That's why I asked you.
Rania, do we have to request you?
To please come and spread
the magic of your voice.
Me? No, no, I have a sore throat.
It wouldn't matter even
if your throat was fine,
because you're going
to sing off-key anyway.
Okay, okay, come on, come on.
No, no, I can't sing,
I don't know how to sing.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Dude, I've never sung before.
Come on.
Come on Rania, come on Rania.
Rania, Rania, Rania,
Rania, Rania.
Rania, Rania,
Rania, Rania.
Oh wow.
Now it’s your turn.
Tiger.
Okay then,
are you ready team Mahir?
1, 2, 3, go.
Do you know everyone is laughing,
talking, singing, dancing,
and I am over here alone talking to you.
Why are you sitting in the room?
You should also go dance, sing,
and enjoy with everyone else.
No,
you know I don't like anything
without you.
What happened?
Oh, nothing you just said it with
so much love that It just slipped.
Okay, darling,
I mean, darling Khawar,
I wanted to say that please just bring
just a ring for the ceremony,
bring a whole jewellery set.
Yes, yes, we will bring a whole jewellery set,
why are you getting worried?
Really?
There should be a personal car for me.
I don't like taking lifts.
It is not even something to mention,
just order what you want.
Oh really?
That's it for now,
I haven't seen a man
as beautiful as you.
You are really beautiful Khawar,
really pretty, I love you.
Mother?
Yes?
I wanted to say, it would have been nice if you
had invited Rafique Ahmed and his family as well.
Yes we should have invited them as well.
Yes, uncle is absolutely right.
I am saying that this singing
is continued
but call someone funny so
there would be some dance too
and we would also enjoy,
right children?
Yes.
Call them, invite them.
Hello, hello, greetings to everyone
from Anjum.
Live long, live long,
Sister Anjum.
Rania.
Where is Dr. Wasiq,
he didn't come with you?
What do I tell you Rania?
You know about
that arrogant doctor,
he doesn't attend functions like this.
He excused.
But he promised me
that he will attend all the events
and even his father would come.
Yes but what can I do
about this Rania?
How can he excuse himself
just like that,
I will call him right away and ask.
You should take a seat.
Yes, yes.
Hello?
Greetings,
Rania speaking.
Greetings,
how are you?
However I am,
but are a reneger.
You promised me that
you will come, why didn't you?
Actually, at the hospital.
I asked you to come and
bring your father as well,
I was waiting, and you
or your father didn't come.
Hello? Hello?
Yes, doctor,
you don't have to come,
she is naive,
she does not understand that
a person has so many things to do.
No, no, no, you shouldn't come,
and I'd suggest, don't even pick up
her calls if she calls again.
Stay busy, stay busy,
okay bye.
Bye.
I was talking to him,
what is this behavior?
Do you even have self-respect or not?
If a person does not want to come
even after you are insisting so much,
then let it be, you're pining after him.
But I want him and his father to come.
Hey?
You are not even a little bit ashamed?
How you're saying this
in front of me?
What's wrong with that?
I am just telling you my wishes.
Same thing again,
let's go outside,
everyone is waiting for you.
This Dr. Wasiq
Okay now give it to me,
I will show you
how to actually play this.
Listen, you are saying this as if I was
banging a box instead of playing the drum.
Well that's what it sounded like.
Okay, all the girls,
sing with me, okay?
And if I don't hear your voice,
look at this,
I'll give you an injection as big as this,
understand?
Aunt, do you want water?
Yes my child.
Well aunt, look at Laiba,
how she's enjoying.
Yes.
Here you go.
Well, it would have been fun
if Farhad and uncle Ayaz were here too.
Yes, they were going to come
But my father has a land in a village,
and there was a problem with it
so they went out of town to solve it.
Oh, so when will they return?
By tomorrow.
Okay, have some water
I'm going to sit with them.
Yes.
Hello? Hello?
Yes brother.
Order for sweets brother,
the event has started,
when are you going to deliver?
What?
Yes, what?
Your child is unwell,
what happened?
Oh, stomach,
which hospital?
Yes take him there, no problem, no, no,
do your thing first then deliver the sweets.
Oh, mother.
Hello? Son, what happened?
We are having an event here.
And these sweets are not in a small amount,
we ordered about 40 kgs,
that hasn't arrived yet.
Okay I understand your child is sick,
ask your wife to take him
to the hospital in a cab
and you reach here with the sweets.
What?
Two hours? How can you?
We're waiting for you here, two hours
is a lot of time, arrive right now, yes.
Here, that's how you talk,
or they won't come.
Mother,
40 kgs of sweets isn't excessive?
Oh it's just to show off,
who even eats the sweets anymore,
every second person has diabetes.
Just, the sweets I ordered,
I'll send some to your house and
some to Rafique Ahmed's.
Then Rafique Ahmed will do better than
me in their turn after seeing our sweets.
And the rest I'll distribute
to the neighborhood,
they'll be happy too,
and we can show off as well.
Well, what do you like in sweets?
I actually don't eat sweets.
See, nobody likes nowadays.
Everyone has diabetes.
Come on.
The grace of God, wow.
Mother decorated the house
with delight.
Oh, my beloved home.
Wow.
Thank you brother,
thank you.
You arrived so soon?
Well, tell me.
Is it a complete 40 kg?
It’s complete.
Really good,
what were you going to miss
if you had brought 2-3 guys with you?
Who's going to pick up
all this now?
Well, pick up these two at least,
come on.
Come on Dabeer,
go to your mother.
And now this one.
Hey, Mr. Guest, see
how you arrived just in time.
There is sit basket, help us a little,
take it inside with us.
I, I, I, I take it inside?
Yes, who else? My father will pick it up?
You have a long tongue.
Well, Mr. Guest, it's not a big deal,
it's just a basket, pick it up.
You'll go inside, eat, drink,
and go back to your home.
Mother is really angry
because he arrived so early.
Come on Mr. Guest, pick it up.
Come with him.
Carefully, it's really expensive.
Okay, okay, let's meet mother.
Even the tea is served but
where is the man with sweets,
he’s on his way for the last 30 minutes,
where is he?
Call him, it’s too late.
Hey, mother, where do I
put this basket of sweets?
Put it down,
why are you standing on my head?
Mother, won’t you pay labor?
Oh, oh, I’m dead.
Father, give us some
attention as well.
My father returned,
my father has arrived.
Mother, when I used to talk to him
on Skype,
he seemed so scrawny,
look at him now how handsome he is.
Isn’t he exactly like how
I was when I was young?
Are you kidding?
I feel great to meet everyone.
Uncle, I’m Rania,
we talked a lot on Skype.
Come here, my child.
Obviously I recognized, who could
forget a beautiful face like this?
Live long, live long.
Oh, come on,
let’s have some entertainment.
Come on.
Who else can play drum
in presence of Dabeer?
Oh, Mona.
Greetings.
Hey Mona, how are you?
Absolutely fine.
Congratulations,
live long, live long.
Now listen to my drums.
Uncle Dabeer’s.
Let’s sit.
My skills are famous across the border.
Come on everyone,
listen to my father.
Place your knee,
place your knee here.
Okay so I’m starting, then
we’ll sing loud and good songs.
Okay? Ready, 1, 2.
Here you go,
that’s how you play it now.
I’ll go to my mother now.
Here my king.
Come on.
Wow.
My mother.
I’ll sit on my mother’s feet.
Okay, tell me, you did not
bring seety with you?
Mother, it’s pronounced sweetie.
Whatever, why did you not bring her
with you?
Mother I told you,
her legs broke into pieces.
She is not allowed
to travel in a plane
that’s why I didn’t bring her.
But don’t worry,
I’ll introduce you to her.
Enjoy the entertainment now.
I want to frame and preserve
this delight in my heart forever.
Who knows if I ever get to witness
this again or not?
Tell me Rania,
you are alright?
Father?
You’re alright,
let me ask her.
She’s pretty.
Come on, play it girls,
why are you quiet? Come on.
Yes.
Mother carefully,
carefully, focus.
Come on, Shehenshah son,
go and open the gate.
What happened to Rafique Ahmed?
Does he need permission
to come to our house?
He used to come here every second day,
what happened now.
This person, Rafique Ahmed,
he’s a sweet person.
Really?
And he really respect me a lot.
Sure.
He is not arrogant at all,
and doesn’t like to show off.
Really? That’s good.
Greetings, welcome father.
Greetings, greetings.
Greetings sister.
Hey Dabeer. Greetings.
Wow, wow, wow.
What happened to you?
Did you all fight before coming here,
coming in all separate cars?
No sister,
but if we have four cars in the house
then why should we only use one?
Come on, should we go inside or
do you want red carpet here as well?
No, no, sister,
there is no need for that.
Actually I do not want to bother you else,
the groom’s father does deserve
the red carpet, right?
And you didn’t tell us,
such great people are here.
American citizen,
where he has numerous big stores.
Big reputation.
Wow.
Why are you humiliating me?
Come on, come on.
Greetings, brother Khawar.
Today you look, not pleasant.
You should’ve washed your face
with a nice face wash instead.
Oh Khawar,
who are you even listening to.
Did you see that?
He only wanted to get married to Mona,
how he showed his true colors.
How he used to act like
a poor soul earlier.
Leave it, let it be.
What do we have to do with
that if Mona is happy.
Why are you acting like a
problematic aunt?
Mona?
Mona is flying so high in the sky as if she’s
getting married to a prince of a great kingdom.
Why are you getting angry over it?
Your rich father is also here,
there are showing off their wealth there,
you can say the same
about yours here.
No Rania,
I don’t have the habit to brag.
But I want to take down Khawar.
I want to do something to
humiliate him so much
that he’d never be able to brag
in front of me out of embarrassment.
Let Mona be a part of his life,
he’ll learn his lesson.
They’ll all be obeying her orders.
Come on, let’s go inside.
Mother, what are you saying?
We just arrived and
everyone is enjoying right now,
I’m not going home.
Laiba, aren’t you listening to me?
Let’s go home I’m suffocated.
What happened aunt?
Are you alright?
Yes Rania, this shine of money,
this display of wealth,
what is all this?
See, I don’t have all this for showoff,
I won’t be able to do that.
Aunt why are you getting worried,
I don’t like any of those either.
And please don’t take
any of this to your heart,
don’t listen to anyone
just enjoy this event.
Here you go, your own daughter-in-law
does not like anytime like this,
now you shouldn’t be worried at all.
But Rania, people will compare.
We will find a solution
for that later,
but now you should enjoy first,
see how sad is Laiba.
Everyone is singing outside,
let’s go and sing,
come on, come on.
Aunt come on, please.
Just for a little while.
Come on.
It’s so entertaining,
I’m seeing after 20 years.
Wow.
Come and sit here,
with everyone else.
Come on, take a seat.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings sister, how are you?
How is everything at the office?
All thanks to God.
Well you’re a great woman,
in this inflation,
I don’t know how you’re managing
the expenses.
Uncle, Aunt has an amazing job
and she earns pretty well.
Well, grandmother was telling me
you used to have a hard time
making ends meet.
And just recently got rich.
And these people have
generational wealth.
What?
See, I already had an idea,
I knew it was new money.
There used to be a custom of
serving tea or beverages at your place,
does it not exist anymore?
Are we here to talk only?
Oh no, no,
why would the customs
not exist anymore?
We have a lot of tea,
drink if you want to drink,
and dive if you want to dive in it.
Yes, and dive with your cars,
you can do more showoff.
Tell us, with which car
would you dive first?
Brother?
Yes, I’ll be back.
Mahir and Rania,
I don’t understand
why are you always giggling with
your heads close to each other.
We have respectable guests,
why are you ignoring them?
I will make tea for you brother-in-law.
And mother specially ordered
40 kgs of sweets just for you.
I’ll go get it.
Father,
we forgot the sweets,
we came empty-handed,
isn’t it embarrassing?
You didn’t remind me,
well we can’t do anything now.
Sit properly you look like a hamster.
Sister, where did Dabeer go?
He just got here, so he said
he’ll go and freshen up.
He’s been wearing the same clothes
since yesterday, the ones he wore on the plane.
Okay, then it’s fine.
Here you go brother-in-law,
I made it by myself
with jaggery, pistachio,
and almond.
She never made tea for me
with so much love,
money has a lot of power,
even the dumbest man
looks good to people.
And take the sweets too.
Yes, take the sweets,
it’s round like your face.
I’ll be back.
Sister-in-law Saman.
Yes?
Why is your sister’s
mother-in-law so quiet?
She’s probably feeling inferior
among wealthy people.
Listen.
Currently, you’re staring at Rabail
and Mona is staring at you.
I hope there won’t be blades
that’ll cut both your legs,
so I’d suggest, focus on Mona.
Instead of Rabail,
because you’re happy
with this marriage, right?
Yes, yes, Salik dance.
Yes, Salik is dancing.
Wait a minute,
that’s what you call a dance?
This isn’t called dance,
you should have flexibility
in your body for dance.
Yes.
And you should have so much
passion in you
that you set that dance floor on fire.
Thank you, take a side,
I’ll demonstrate.
Sit, watch, and learn.
Very good.
Dj, please play the song.
Me? Dj?
Stand here, the enemy of my dignity.
You shouldn’t be doing things
you know nothing about.
People are saying did you adopt
a monkey’s child.
People are jealous of us, father.
Currently my brain is also on fire.
Do not get smacked by me today.
Whenever I plan on gaining respect
or getting appreciation, you ruin it.
Hey Shehenshah, come here.
Go and tell my drivers
to take away 2 cars,
we’ll return in only one.
No, instead tell them
to take away all the cars,
we’ll return by public transport,
that’s what we deserve.
Owl.
