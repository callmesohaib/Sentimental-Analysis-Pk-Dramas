Did you guys see,
how she was emphasizing every word,
that I call father,
whenever I want money.
Who is she to say anything,
I will ask for money whenever I want,
I have a right to that.
Oh don't be angry, don't get mad,
she's an unkind woman.
She doesn't even respect our mother.
I am getting restless looking at her.
I don't know when will she return,
if I could I would go away from
this house for a while.
Why would you go? Why would
any of us go anywhere?
This house belongs to all of us,
if someone has to go, it's her.
But she said this is her house.
She won't get the ownership of this house
just by saying that it's hers.
I got this house built
by my own hands,
this is my house,
I mean this is our house.
I have decided that
I am going back tomorrow.
Bebo why would you go back?
You came recently. Rania,
please convince her.
She is wiser than me,
she knows a person is responsible
for their own dignity.
Oh, it looks like a meeting is in process,
some important decisions are being made.
Was I wrong to come here?
No, no, come on have a seat.
And why did you get up so soon?
You must be tired after a long flight,
you should rest.
The ones who have so many
responsibilities on their shoulder
can only think about taking rest,
cannot actually take rest.
Pakistani people only assume
that dollars grow on trees,
that's not true,
we have to work really
to earn in dollars.
And when those hard-earned
dollars are wasted,
it really saddens.
Just like how I'm sad.
Why are you sad about giving
people their rightful money?
It's a long story
but wait for it your question
will be answered.
Tea?
Do you want tea?
I make really good tea.
Yes,
even the tea would be prepared
in a bucket here,
I would like to try some.
You will really like it, Seema special milk
and tea, extra jaggery.
Rabail, I'm going to my friend's,
inform grandmother.
Listen,
leave the car keys inside,
I have to go somewhere.
He is showing attitude as if
it’s his father's car.
Hey my luck, my luck.
So in this moment of joy why not
we go to some five-star restaurant?
Me too, me too.
No problem at all,
I can take your whole crew with you
if you ask me to,
I have a lot of money.
Oh no, no.
I mean what would
these poor people do,
going to a restaurant, they already
have problems of their own.
Brother Dabeer's wife
has returned from America,
she's been
Really?
She also scolded brother Mahir.
Yes, she annoyed him the most.
Wow, live long, live long,
just know that I'll come to your house
very soon to see his live insult.
Dabeer, when I told that mannerless
son of yours to leave the keys here
then why did he take the car?
Sweetie, don't get angry
without any reason,
I'll talk to him when he'll return.
What are you going to tell him?
You need to explain this stray cat,
it's Mahir's car why would
he leave the car at home?
He didn't go for some aimless wandering,
he went for some work,
explain this to her,
she's been ringing like a whistle all day.
Dabeer, tell your mother to not
meddle in my matters,
you could be jailed for talking like this
if it were America.
Hey, listen to me,
this is not your America,
this is our Pakistan. I'll speak,
I will definitely speak,
tell her, if she won't understand
then take her to a hotel.
What?
Dabeer, listen to
what your mother is saying,
she is telling me to shift to a hotel.
Why would I shift to a hotel,
I would shift you all to a road.
I'm dead.
Sweetie, let's go to our room
for a few minutes,
we'll talk there, come,
let's go to the room.
Okay, we'll talk in the room,
because if I say anything here,
your family won't be able
to bear your insult.
Come, come to the room,
come to the room with me.
What happened?
What happened grandmother?
I can't breathe.
Oh grandmother,
grandmother is not well.
I think we should take her
to the hospital,
I will call brother Dabeer
and brother Hammad.
No, it will only spread the stress,
do one thing, go to the neighbors
and tell Farhad to get the car.
Okay.
Grandmother,
try to breathe,
I will get water for you,
wait, wait, wait.
Why did you bring me to a hospital,
I'm quite alright, I am telling you
I just got mad so blood pressure
must've raised, nothing else.
Grandmother, you should focus
on your health
and let that Sweetie be on her own,
don't listen to her.
I am telling you,
I won't get admitted here,
that's why don't come to the hospital
I get suffocated,
please take me home.
Okay but see the doctor first he will
prescribe a medicine or two, that's it.
Or wait, I'll get you a wheelchair.
There is no need for that,
I can walk,
nothing happened to me,
I am not as weak as that
foreign woman thinks of me.
Yes grandmother, but relax first
and get the receipt.
Yes.
Sorry, sorry,
we left the file in the car, I'll go get it.
No, no, Farhad, take her to get
the receipt, give me the keys.
Sure?
Yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
here you go, here's the keys.
Come on grandmother, come.
Asma.
Asma, my sister.
But what are you doing here?
Is everything alright?
Asma,
Asma please, my sister.
Don't look away,
I'm really ashamed.
Want to apologize for what I did.
The time for apologizing and forgiveness
has long gone, brother.
You were occupied in your own world
and we learned to live without you.
Just wait for a little more, Dr. Wasiq
would be here any moment,
we will go once we see him and
I won't take any of your excuses.
Where is Bebo, I'll go see her,
you stay here, don't move, I'll be back.
Okay.
How are you?
I'm alright.
I,
I'm really ashamed of my behavior that day,
actually I couldn't understand your emotions.
It's okay,
maybe I overreacted.
No, no, you didn't do anything,
actually I was trapped in my own mind
that's why I couldn't understand your feelings.
You,
you should come to visit me,
tell me your story,
you lost your father
and I lost everything.
Oh, leave me, I'm alright.
Calmly.
I am not as weak to not even compete
with that American pest.
Really, you're alright, right?
What happened maximum?
You forgot to take the medicine for 2 days
in the joy of the arrival of your daughter-in-law.
The doctor is crazy to prescribe
all those medicines.
I am telling you,
I am taking all the medicines on time
because I need to fight that
stray cat and win.
Very good,
we're with you in this mission.
We won't sit back till you win,
right Bebo.
Bebo? Bebo.
Did you hear what
grandmother had to say?
She is the one behind all this.
I'll go get the medicines, okay?
Yes.
Rania my child, call Mahir
and ask if he has reached
home or not.
Since this witch arrived he does
not find peace at home.
He will reach home, he is not a child
and he is not even as naive as you think.
He knows how to fight very well.
Rania,
what is your problem?
You are the one with the problem
that you are entering someone's room
without knocking on the door.
Go back outside and take permission first.
Did you ask permission
before entering our lives?
Grandmother was unwell
and you didn't even call me
to inform,
you know how close I am with her,
how much I love her.
There are already so many
problems in this house
so I thought everyone would
panic even more.
Well, grandmother is absolutely fine,
you can go meet her if you want.
And yes,
only express anger on the ones
you're angry at,
I'm not here to tolerate
everyone's tantrums.
Hey mother,
you went to the hospital alone,
you didn't tell anyone.
What were you going to do,
are you a doctor?
Mother you make us laugh I swear.
You should have taken along someone.
I didn't go all alone,
he went with me, Farhad.
And with me was Rania,
everyone at the hospital knows Rania,
everyone left their work
and catered to us.
Okay then eat this as well.
Okay.
Well that's true, Rania knows
how to win the hearts.
Yes.
Mother, leave all this,
tell me are you alright?
Yes I am absolutely alright,
just looking at that stray cat
makes my blood boil.
It's ancestral blood,
it boils fast.
Tell me one thing you told us that,
your wife's leg fractured,
did you lie to us?
Now you will see,
I'll send her back with the fractured leg.
Thank God grandmother
you are alright,
do you know how worried
I was for you?
Not only alright
you are also ready to attack.
What do you think,
your grandmother is a strong woman.
I am not scared of American caterpillars.
Leave her grandmother
she is already mad, stupid.
Why would we let her go?
Do you know all those years when
you enabled and ignored her behavior,
that is the reason she does not
consider us anything now.
How does she talk to
grandmother like that?
You should be ashamed
she is older than you
talk to her with respect.
When did I misbehave?
I was behaving quite alright
and you should tell her that
I am not accustomed to this attitude,
she shouldn't talk to me like that.
I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.
Why you shouldn't have come?
I am your mother,
I yearned to see your face.
And don't be your wife's slave,
be a man and learn to say what's true.
Yes brother she's right.
I made this especially for you with jaggery,
you know brown sugar.
Thank you.
Well sister-in-law can you see
how there is chaos at your house?
Yes, I realized it
as soon as I reached,
the whole family is looting
my dollars with both hands.
100%, apart from my family.
Okay tell me one thing,
why are there so many irrelevant
relatives living in this house?
On top of that, even the neighbors
are always here,
this is the limit.
Well,
now that Sweetie is here,
she'll make everything alright.
Sweetie sister-in-law,
I'm with you, I'll be right beside you.
And also I think of you
as my older sister.
Well, I don't need anyone,
but it's okay if you insist.
Okay tell me, why does Dabeer's son
always have an attitude?
Please explain to me.
He's pampered by grandmother,
he's like that to everyone,
he's really arrogant and ill-natured.
He's the one in possession of
all your dollars,
and he only shops for himself.
Hammad, why are you clearing
your throat like this?
I'm not saying wrong,
anyways I don't have the habit to lie.
There are only two people who sympathize
with you in the whole house,
my sister Mona and I, Seema.
Seema, come outside with me,
I need to talk to you
about something important.
Excuse me sister in law
we will be back.
Go, I'm coming.
Come.
Sister-in-law if you need anything
snacks, juice, tea or coffee,
just call out my name
and I will be there.
You called me?
That is so wrong Seema
I can't even tell you how much
you have disappointed me.
You have been talking ill about
the family in front of her,
it's the same people who care
about you, who respect you.
They arranged your sister's engagement
with so much luxury.
And Mahir, how much
he cares about our children,
he fulfills all their needs.
And you were talking like
that about him.
Take your phone and
start playing games on it
because that's all you're capable of.
If you don't know the matter don't try
to include yourself in it.
I don't want to see you talking with
sister-in-law Sweetie like this again.
I will, I know very well
where the river flows.
Sister-in-law Sweetie is the
next big thing,
anyone on her side will be
benefited from this.
If you want to support the opposite group
then you do you,
who is there to stop you?
it's good for you.
Listen to me.
Yes, Mr. Listen to me.
Listen Khawar,
won't you have time for me
after marriage as well?
You know you are my first
and last love
I cannot even imagine
going away from you.
What, really? It's true?
I can't believe.
Are you standing in front of a mirror?
Yes.
Then move your existence
to somewhere else,
you might believe then.
Okay, okay.
Mona darling,
how long is this film going to run?
Why do you have a problem
with such things?
You know the stressed environment
in the house,
and this Khawar is not running anywhere,
he'll stay.
Listen to me,
I did not bring this tension here,
and now don't interrupt me
in the middle of it.
Yes darling,
you should definitely come,
I'll wait for you.
Here we go, she's inviting
Khawar as well,
As if there's is a circus at this house
that everyone should watch.
The way everyone is behaving
with me in his house,
I'm not accustomed to it,
I hope I won't leave the house.
Why would you leave the house,
if someone has to leave it
should be Sweetie.
What that Sweetie makes noise
it hurts my ears.
What happened, why does everyone
look so worried and sad?
It looks like some
important plan has failed.
You tell me,
when are you planning to return?
I'm not planning anything like that,
I feel quite at home at this place
and I have been seeing a lot of things
I need to fix around the house,
then I will think about it.
Sweetie, you're here?
The weather outside is very pleasant,
I think you feel really good sitting there.
You are telling me to go sit in the lawn,
so all of you could sit here comfortably.
No, no, no, no, no.
God's forgiveness,
what are you saying Sweetie,
how could this be true?
Coward. Wife's servant.
Why do you all look so scared of me,
what do you think,
am I going to take the count
of every dollar from you?
What, what, what, what?
What did you say?
Tally of dollars? What dollars?
Which dollars is she talking about?
No, no, no, no,
Sweetie is just telling a joke.
Yes, I have a habit of making
dangerous jokes,
and sometimes I get serious
while joking, right Dabeer?
You didn't tell them?
And I never joke,
I'm always serious,
didn't you tell her Dabeer?
I, I'm a lone soul,
what am I going to tell?
Both of these have
so many good qualities.
Hello, hello, hello.
I have a good news.
Uncle Rafique,
who is my father-in-law,
he's coming to visit us with his family.
Now tell us the good news.
This is the good news,
whenever you say something
it's useless.
This Rafique doesn't have
peace at his place,
listen, tell Seema to arrange
dinner for them.
Okay, bye.
There is always a luster at this place,
sometimes Rabail's in-laws,
sometimes Mona's in-laws,
a lot of dollars are being spent,
right Dabeer?
No, yes, no, yes.
You could've refused at least.
What happened?
What happened? Nothing.
I realized my mistake a long ago,
I just delayed the return.
I went home, I begged father,
I apologized to Aasia but
they didn't forgive me.
Please Bebo, please,
put in the good words for me.
Tell me how is my doll?
You remember you also had a child?
You're apologizing to me,
what do I forget?
And how do I forgive,
you are in debt of a lot of people
not just me.
If possible,
please think about me
and contact me.
What happened,
why are you standing here alone?
Nothing.
Rani, I was just thinking,
now I should go back,
Brother Dabeer's wife?
Her behavior isn't right.
It seems like
she has assumed that we are staying here
to get free favours.
Yes,
I also think that I won't be able
to live here for long,
I will have to shift to a hostel.
Bebo, talk to grandfather,
tell him that I'll spend
as less as possible,
but I can't stay here anymore.
Okay, you don't have to worry.
Hey Sweetie,
what are you doing here
in Mahir's room?
This is Mahir's room?
Yes, yes.
I thought this room belonged
to some prince.
What's happening here?
Your father is saying that
this is your room
and I am saying that it seems like a
big showroom of a luxury brand.
Wow, everything is branded.
Have you ever asked your father?
He spends the whole year in just
two pairs of shirts and trousers.
What are you trying to say?
What would I say? I am speechless.
Are you a son of a salesman like Dabeer
or are you the son of the owner
of a superstore like Sweetie.
What?
Salesman.
Yes, your father is bragging everywhere,
I'm the owner of that superstore,
Sweetie.
Oh God, you people robbed me
of my money.
Oh, Mahir, seems like you got upset.
Dabeer would you like to shed
some light on this matter?
Look, you shouldn't get so angry,
you'll get sick.
I'm really angry,
and till I take it all out on someone
I won't get better.
Sweetie, listen to me calmly,
guests are coming to meet you,
you should be careful you'll get sick,
we will talk later.
Yes, yes, Mr. Dabeer tell me,
tell me my crown,
state what you're saying.
Don't get angry,
don't get angry.
Sweetie.
Oh wait a minute dude.
Salesman.
For so many years,
you have been cheating on me,
you have been deceiving me, and you’ve
been sending all my dollars here.
No, no, no, Sweetie,
there is nothing like that,
I never hid anything from you,
I tell you everything.
And anyway, Mahir has
his own business here.
Really?
Tell me, what business does he have?
Tell me right now.
He has a business of property.
Really?
He deals with the properties?
Yes.
Father sends my dollars here and
the son buys the properties here,
that's a business of properties.
It is not like this Sweetie.
Then all of these properties are
built on my money.
That means this mansion was
also built from my dollars,
then this mansion belongs
to Sweetie Madam.
Now you will transfer the registration
of this house to my name,
right now, first thing.
Do you understand?
Don't do this Sweetie,
what are you saying?
For God's sake have mercy
on my situation.
No mercy, no sympathy,
you have to do this right now.
This house does not have
anything called privacy,
a person cannot even peacefully
argue and their own room,
come on, come on.
Uncle the guests have arrived.
Guests arrived so soon?
Actually they wanted to see you
so they came so soon.
Oh yes, they also have to meet the rich,
wealthy American daughter-in-law.
Uncle, you don't have to
put on any makeup,
let her do it, you look good anyway,
come, hurry up.
Hey, hey, how ill-mannered she is.
Well, nobody can be more
ill-mannered than me,
I was famous as the most
belligerent in my village.
Also tell me, should I be sorry
about this or proud?
I'll tell this to you later.
Sister Sweetie will be here,
2 minutes.
Greetings,
greetings.
Greetings, uncle how are you?
We're good.
I'm good uncle
but I'm upset at you.
Why? Why are you upset with me,
what did I do?
The funny kind, why didn't you bring
aunt to our home?
We have such a big house.
Yes, yes my child why won't I come,
I'll come.
Hey Arbab, come dude,
how are you?
I'm absolutely fine.
This fair look suits you.
Oh my uncle.
Oh pride of this family.
Mr. Dabeer.
Uncle you humiliate me.
You should sit, take a seat.
My lovely sister, these are not only
Saman's in-laws
they're also the in-laws
of my sister Mona.
Please be considerate,
remember I'm on your team,
that's Khawar.
Here comes your aunt.
Hello everyone.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
Yes excuse me,
this is me wealthy Khawar.
In coming times, we'll be counted
as one of the most elite people.
Oh, so you are Khawar, future elite.
It seems like along with your health
your brain is also in a bad condition,
you should keep eating like us.
We have so many businesses
in America,
we don't get impressed
by such small things.
Tea, let me get the tea.
Yes, you should bring the tea.
Aunt, come here, you're so sweet,
come sit with uncle.
Sure.
Sit, sit. Uncle Rafique,
this is my uncle Rafique.
So you don't have anything here
in Pakistan.
No here as well,
my father has a village,
he is the head of the community
in his village.
And he has a lot of cows
and other animals.
We're also generationally wealthy,
my grandfather's busses used to
roam around the whole Pakistan.
Really?
My father has horses, cows,
and donkeys as well,
and father's donkeys are so famous,
they destroy all the fields
in the village.
But nobody dares disrespect
my father's donkeys.
Yes, yes, at the end of the day
they're donkeys.
My grandfather had such big mansions
that they used to play polo
in the drawing room.
Well my father's mansions are still there,
we're still generationally wealthy,
not surviving on the past achievements.
Sweetie, listen about the present times.
You must have heard about
the cut mountain in Karachi,
why is it named like this,
this mountain belonged to us,
we cut it in half and shipped it
to Lahore to have in our backyard.
Oh, oh, let me tell you about
an incident from last year,
Trump invited me for tea.
Oh.
Not oh, not that, this tea.
Oh you drank tea.
We also drank a lot
but don't mention it in public.
We keep drinking.
Let it go, let it go,
I was telling you.
Should I reheat the dinner for you,
you want some?
I am not in the mood.
Okay, whatever you want.
Are you seeing their behavior against me,
this woman's?
She is always after me,
I don't know when will she leave,
we will be relieved.
Whenever I see her,
she is shooting arrows of tantrums.
She thinks, the whole house
is being run on her money,
as if we don't do anything,
we're useless.
Hello?
I am talking to you,
why are you not saying anything?
What do I say, it's a matter
of your house.
So this house is not yours?
You also live here,
you should also say something.
I am only a guest here,
I am here today, I will go tomorrow.
You have a say in everyone's problems,
help everyone,
now that it's about me,
you became a guest?
I think you don't need my help,
I only help weak people.
I have been observing Rania,
you've started ignoring me a lot,
did you also team up with this woman?
There is nothing like that,
I have no interest in meddling
in your matters.
I'll shift to a hostel very soon,
my classes are about to start.
How can you shift to a hostel
just like that?
You came here on grandmother's suggestion,
I'll see who dares send you away from here.
But yes if you try to leave on your own,
then do remember,
nobody would be worse than me.
How good you are at acting,
if I hadn't heard those things with Salik,
I would have made a fool out of myself.
I am talking to grandfather about this,
I will shift to a hostel.
I don't want to live here.
Greetings.
Greetings.
You must be here to meet aunt,
come let me get you inside.
No, no, no, no. What if I say
I am here to meet you?
You haven't been visiting lately?
Daily after returning from the office
I make two cups of tea,
lit some candle-lights, and make
a romantic environment just to wait for you.
But from now on,
you'll have to drink that tea alone.
Because I'm going back to the village.
Everything alright?
Did you get offended
by something I said or did?
There is nothing like that.
Then why are you going?
Because I came here as a guest
now I have to go.
Stay a few more days.
That's not possible for me anymore.
Okay so you met up with Rania
and you invited her to our home?
That's awesome.
But father tell me,
what did she say?
Nothing special.
I mean.
She is a pretty sweet girl
she agreed instantly.
Okay, then she will definitely visit
in a day or two.
Father do one thing when she comes,
please call me as well.
Why?
No, she'll be coming to meet me,
so what will you do?
I have something really important
so father please call me.
Yes, yes, what this important thing is,
it's being obviously from your face.
Father, she,
she is a really nice girl.
When did I say she is not nice,
yes, she is an amazing girl.
It seems like her parents must've
brought her up in the right manner.
Obviously,
I am getting late for the hospital,
I'll leave father.
Have a good day.
Thank you.
Okay.
Bye.
Why is he not coming back?
Why is he not coming? His house is next door,
where is he, must've stayed for the tea.
Come on, he came.
Uncle, I don't know
what you make me do things.
Come, come and see for yourself,
it seems like he hasn't eaten in days.
He'll die in a few days.
Uncle, what am I seeing?
What condition you've made of yourself?
I don't want to talk to anyone,
I am heartbroken.
They're going, go.
Your heart broke for no reason,
something must have happened.
Not something, a lot of things happened,
that's what he isn't even telling us.
That's why we have called you,
he might tell you.
I even applied for a job for her
and she left me alone.
You're talking about Aunt?
Yes.
Aunt rejected your love?
It didn't even reach till love confession,
the garden died before
spring could arrive.
Uncle, the autumn, I mean
aunt's departure has a lot of times.
You should go tell her about your love
and confess at least,
make her believe in your loyalty.
Well I think, they might have been
some effects there as well.
What? What? What?
What are you saying?
How? Confirmed?
Not.
But it's my assumption.
You shouldn't worry,
I will call grandfather directly
and tell him there is a gem like uncle,
who lives in the neighborhood of grandmother.
Not uncle, my child, not uncle.
Tell him in grandmother's neighborhood
there is a gem like, beautiful gem-like boy.
By the way, there would be hardly two years
of an age difference between me and Farhad.
Farhad must've been
two years older than me,
I've increased the age
because of the government job.
Okay, okay, I'll say this,
don't worry.
I'll tell him, I've found
a gem-like boy for aunt.
You're telling the truth?
This can actually happen?
Yes, why won't it happen?
It'll definitely happen.
Now think of me
as aunt's representative,
I accept this relationship from my side.
Done.
Done.
Where are the wedding bands playing?
