Ah, my new car!
oh wow
Whose car is this? Is it yours?
I mean I don’t have car service station
so if a car this big is standing
in my lawn it must be mine
If you have such a big car,
then why were you on the bus
the other day?
That was just fate making sure
that I saw your real face
who you really are.
Yeah, so listen,
will you teach me how to drive?
Teach you? No, I’ll buy you one
All you will have to do is just pull
the thread and it’ll move on its own
Haha
look at yourself you can’t handle a car,
get a bike or something
if you have one, I’ll get one too
Wait a second, that means she's.."
Nonsense!
She thinks she’s on my level,
people can be so delusional sometimes
Don’t you worry, you will have fun.
Greetings, Mian Sahab,
how is everyone?
How’s mom and Bebo?
everything’s alright here
just it’s been very quiet here
since you left
There are so many voices here
Mian Sahab
but none of them are yours
or mom’s or bebe’s
My heart‘s been sad too
Yeah, but don’t you forget!
you are there for a reason
you have to study hard and make
your headmaster grandpa proud
hopefully.
to be honest the bright lights here
almost blinded me
I am so used to your love
and kindness
that I couldn’t even bear
a harsh comment,
but it’s better now
By the way,
is everything okay with you?
yes, everything is perfectly alright,
Ammaji is like a carbon copy of yours
and everyone else is nice as well
And you know me,
I am prone to building my own world;
I'll make everyone like me,
and those who aren't in my favour,
I'll let them know
I am not to be messed with.
But anyway, tell me what Mom
and Aunt are doing.
Get them on the phone
Your mother, I believe, is praying,
and Bebu is in the kitchen cooking.
I can get them if you want
no no, you stay put,
i’ll talk to them tonight
but give them my regards.
okay look,
we sent you before
your result came out
you have plenty of time
to look at different universities
so you can take admission
Don’t you worry; I'll do it,
and you know Rabail?
Ammaji’s granddaughter;
she’ll help me out.
take care
okay Mian Sahab,
I’ll talk to you later.
Bye
Bye.
Hammad, put your phone away.
I have to talk to you about
something important.
I am listening.
I swear Hammad one day
I’ll lose my patience
and either I’ll break this phone
or your head
why do you get so hyper for no reason?
I am utterly focused on
whatever you have to say.
Hammad, tell me
why do you think Ammaji has
invited this girl to our house?
There's no reason to invite
your relatives to your house,
they just come and go.
I think something’s up
what?
I think Ammaji has her
in mind for Mahir.
no no, it’s nothing like that,
she’s only here to get an education.
I don’t know, you have to make sure
Mona’s chances remain intact.
that girl is way too innocent to compete
with mona’s cleverness.
Hammad!
at least allow me to speak my truth.
My poor sister is willing to marry
that rude nephew of yours just for our sake
and what are you saying about her?
My sister is very innocent
oh yes she’s innocent, just like you.
Nice and innocent.
Uncle, do you want me
to bring you lunch?
oh no, not right now
I don’t feel like it.
Rania’s been gone for only two days,
and you’re already getting sad.
I called her
What did she say?
How is she?
Does she miss us?
it’s her first time being
so far away from us
she’s very brave and courageous,
she can handle herself
That she is.
she said she’ll call tonight
to talk to you and Bebo
Nice,
You should call your sister
and ask how's everything
who knows what our little devil
has done yet.
No, no, my Rania is very smart,
and she knows what to do.
I explained it all to her.
if you don’t feel like eating
I can make you some tea
tea sounds good
well smile then, don’t be sad
I am not that sad.
you didn’t negotiate with
the shopkeeper at all,
you just handed him all the money
You do realize money doesn't grow
on trees, do you?
It seems like it does.
What do you mean?
Ammaji and Brother Mahir told me
not to bargain for these small things,
it’s a norm for poor people and
we are the elite, it doesn't suit us
I swear this Mahir Sahab of yours
is so insufferable
go, go
the kids are back
go, quickly
Hey you, stop, now!
Can’t you see? He didn’t even get off
and you started moving
you shameless man.
Oh, ma'am, they do it every day;
they are well-practiced.
we don’t send our kids to a circus,
if you ever do such a thing again
I swear i’ll make you regret it
Don’t you dare come here
asking for you fee,
you’re not getting anything
from us this month
what are you saying the kid
is perfectly fine
Let’s go
wait a second,
what happened?
he pushed the kid out
of a moving vehicle
He did what?
How dare you?
she’s lying, i did no such thing
show me
Oh my god, this man injured our child
Just say the word, and
I’ll punch his nose off his face.
Why should we take the law into
our own hands?
We should just hand him over to the police,
they’ll teach him a proper lesson
Ma’am please forgive me,
I swear i’ll never to do it again
Here I’ll do however many sit-ups
you like but please forgive me
Okay, I am letting you go this time,
but from now on you’ll wait until
the kids are in the house.
Do you understand?
Why wait?” I’ll take them inside myself.
okay okay you can go now
So it’s all good, right?
Yes, okay, let’s go.
No wait, don’t start,
don’t leave without me
hey kids, let’s go inside
let’s go
Is there anything else
I can do for you?
No, thank you for having my back.
He threw him out of the moving van;
what would I have done if my Tipu
had been seriously injured?
this is exactly what happens to the kids
whose fathers stay in bed all day
The driver must’ve thought,
“Who’s going to ask about him?”
Ammaji, Sister Rania dealt
with him really well
and also told him he won’t get
the following month’s fee
You did the right thing.
Very good Rania, Very Good.
I was wondering, Uncle,
why don’t you take
the kids to the van?
Since Uncle is home the entire day
and can pick up and drop off the kids,
I think there is no need for a van.
Everyone agrees that parents are the best
people to handle the children’s obligations,
thus, Uncle will now pick up
and drop off the children.
This wouldn’t be a problem if you were
that responsible in the first place.
Come here, my son,
it has been decided that
from this day forward,
I shall drive my kids to
and from school.
Greetings!
Hello?
Hello?
there’s no need to peak
in every room,
she hasn’t come back
That woman has never shown me
any respect,
she always brings up old stories to
embarrass me in front of the children,
She refuses to acknowledge the fact
that the past is in the past
and we are now much more
richer than them
I don’t care what Aunt says,
you went to bring her home yourself,
she should’ve respected you and came back
I am going to call her now.
Sure, get insulted,
I won’t stop you this time.
How can she do this?
Greetings!
Hello, why didn’t you come back?
Why are you speaking to me
in that tone?
I mean, my respected father came
to bring you home himself,
so why didn’t you come back?
Ammaji asked me to stay
a few more days
I am so sick of your Ammaji
How dare you insult
my grandmother like that?
no, no I did no such thing,
I was only saying that
you should have come…
Saman? Hello?
She cut the call?
I’ll deal with you later
Greetings sir!
Your bike is in very good condition
that’s my first love,
bought it in my college days
and kept her safe ever since
hello!
hello, hello.’
Daddy, do you know
he’s our neighbour
you cutie.
it’s nice to meet you,
I have to take the kids to school
we’ll talk in detail some other time
Okay kids, get on the bike, come.
Tipu, Mano you both forgot
your lunch again
take it, be quick, let’s go
Did you give it to them?
yes!
Bye.
Hi neighbour, how are you?
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?
You must be dropping your kids
off to school
Do you think I look like someone
who has kids?
I go to university, and look,
I have a bag too.
Listen, where have you been?
At home; where else would I be?
I mean to say I don’t really
see you around much
There’s nothing to do on the roads for me,
so I stay home.
you are so witty, I am so impressed by you
You should come over sometime,
I want to talk more about this humour of yours.
Can I go?
you didn’t say when
you will come to our house
I think you should come to our house;
we are very hospitable people.
I have a beautiful Mom,
A cute sister
and there’s an uncle as well
He’s neither beautiful nor cute;
he’s just kind of there.
I will someday,
but I can’t tell you when. Bye.
so I’ll have to wait again
I have to agree,
Rania is very persuasive.
Hammad, who has never listened
to anyone his whole life,
listened to her and agreed.
He’s dropping the kids off
to school today
My cousin is just like that, he’s a very
respected personality in his area
I was thinking,
Why don’t you get her an admission
in the same university as you?
Grandma,
I have a great reputation
at the university I am in
and I would like to keep it that way
What do you mean?
What I mean is, what does
a respectable, clever,
and pious girl like her have
to do with such a place?
Get her admitted somewhere else.
What you don’t know
about me is that
I have secured first position in every class
since I was a little girl,
and whichever university I choose,
would be honoured to have me.
that’s exactly what I am saying
My university and you are
on very different levels
and it’s not like I have some personal rivalry
with an educational institution
otherwise I would’ve gotten her in there
your call, I can do it myself
Ammaji, tell him not to bother. huh!
Best of luck..
the dish, please.
Grandma, sit; let’s eat.
I have already eaten.
stop trying to turn Ammaji against me,
it’s not going to work
Mona, why are you so stubborn,
I told you to come as quick as possible
and you’re still nowhere to be seen
Tell me, when are you coming?
I am waiting.
Keep attending your friends’ weddings
because you’ll never get there
if you miss this chance
You’re so confident as if Mahir has
already said yes to the wedding
listen to me you idiot!
There’s a new girl here,
clever as a fox
She says she’s here
to continue her studies,
but I am sure she was sent here
on some other mission.
Do you understand?
really?
Who is she? What does she look like?
Tell me
well in terms of looks she wins
by a long shot
But how long will you keep getting
these updates from me,
listen to me you need to get here
as soon as possible
What will I do there?
I came once before and Mahir
wasn’t very welcoming.
He’s so rude
listen to me,
forget about all that,
we’ll achieve nothing if you lose
your strength now
Just come!
But listen to me!
I don’t want to hear anything more
Bye.
Look how gorgeous I am,
I wonder who’s there then
I must go there now.
why are you forcing her to come
if she doesn’t want to?
Hammad, I only like you
when you are silent
You never did anything in your life and
you’re holding me back as well
I am just saying,
she failed the last time she was here
and the same thing will happen again
She's not Mahir’s type
you are outwardly insulting
my sister now
You sisters take offense in a second;
what can a man do?
A man like you won’t ever do anything
You will just stay in this bed forever
Do you think I am doing this for Mona?
No, I am doing this for us,
our children and our future
I understand, I completely understand
Don’t you dare try to wreck my plans.
I am warning you.
you are right,
but listen flower,
listen to me dear
If the families aren’t supportive
of the relationship
then the couple has to put
in a little more effort.
You must go through these hardships
to prove your love,
make some drama
The thing is,
the guy’s parents aren’t willing to meet
with the girl’s family, right?
Hmm...
you see it’s not crucial
for the Girl’s family
to introduce themselves as her parents
to the man’s parents
They can just go over to their house
and say something like, Um..
Like,
“We are looking for a house in this area;
do you people have a house in mind?”
Then a conversation will start
which will lead to acquaintance,
then friendship
and and after that there will be
no need to send a proposal,
everything will work out on its own
Do you like my idea?
Who knew Mr. Maheer here would turn out
to be such a filmy person
and in love even though he acts so rude?
What a betrayal!
What a betrayal to Ammaji!
It seems as though the Girl’s parents will be
coming here soon enough.
Sister,
I have sauteed the onion now.
What should I add next?
Tomatoes or yogurt?
What a disaster has happened,
and you’re here worried
about tomatoes and yogurt?
Add them both and go away
And don’t come back,
I have some thinking to do
But how much yogurt and
how many tomatoes?
ugh!
I don’t know go ask aunt,
I am a also a kid myself I don’t know
about these things
Auntie can’t even cook an egg, and here
you are talking about meatballs.
Neither do I, but I have a recipe
Wait, I’ll give it to you
but you need to go right now.
It needs more salt
Go away!
I am going.
Mahir sahab
who lives with such entitlement,
how would he feel
if rain all over his parade.
What if I treat the ones
who are coming in such a way
that they never even think
of coming back’
Haha.
Did you see that?
Yes, I did. Look now.
okay
Look at these useless people
watching cartoon at this age]
Uncle put this show on
I just came here
For god’s sake,
I know I have a thin neck but that doesn’t
mean you can always present me for slaughter
Stop arguing and tell me why you haven’t
done the chores around the house before my arrival.
Why should I do this and
go to the office as well?
You are absolutely right. Mama,
have you seen the girls next door?
They’re so well-mannered
and respectful
What do you mean?
Have you met those girls?
Yeah, I mean, no.
they’re our neighbours so I heard
that about them from here
Okay, when you came to the neighbourhood,
you started making friends?
Hey, I am giving you the last warning.
Just focus on your studies.
I don't want dumb people in this house.
Maybe you are pointing towards me?
Not maybe, I am definitely
pointing towards you.
Laiba? Come to the kitchen.
Knead the dough and do the dishes.
I am coming, mother.
What is it? I am available
for free for them.
I am supposed to do the house chores,
as well as go to the office, do this, do that.
Why does sister abuse me
like this all the time?
What am I?
Be patient, uncle. Be patient.
Because those who are patient
are being rewarded great.
I thought when there will be a decision
about father's property,
then when I will get my share,
I will plan a trip after selling that.
Visit Thailand and Russia.
And maybe get married
to some white woman
I had even selected
the travel packages
But our uncle is sitting on that
land like a poisonous snake,
he’s not even giving me
that little fruit garden
Where do I go?
All my dreams have died,
and no one even cares
about getting me married.
should I bring you some water?
go drown in it instead.
Let the girl’s family come.
They will run away.
They will never get ready to have
the wedding fixed here.
Maheer thinks he is something
out of this world.
I will reverse all his efforts.
I will enjoy a lot.
Sister, Rabia.
Grandmother was calling you
to press her clothes.
Rania?
Come here fast.
What happened?
Come here.
Did you close that? Yes.
If you remember 38’s, do tell me.
Will you teach maths
to the children?
Grandmother has called me
to press her clothes.
Maths? I can easily do it.
Give it to me.
Here you go.
I will be right back after ironing
grandmother’s clothes.
Here, take this pencil, fast.
Rabi? Yes?
What are you doing?
What?
Are you mad?
Are you even concerned about
the children’s future or not?
Hey, our children are the students
of the model school of O’levels.
And this madam?
She has graduated from a small
government school in her village.
If she will teach our children,
not only our money would go
in waste,
future of these children
will be ruined too.
Oh, yes! In our old school,
five plus five was not ten, rather eleven.
Hey, we don’t study maths
in English or Urdu.
We study in another planet’s language.
Right?
Then you come and teach them.
Come on.
Hey, don’t need to mind it.
They are such intelligent children.
And I don’t want that
because of you,
future of these children gets ruined.
Why would I mind it?
It is my good luck,
that I am in the company of
intelligent people like you.
I am learning a lot, right?
For example,
considering yourself out of this world
in front of others.
And how to talk by making faces
and throwing tantrums, right?
And how to degrade others
while talking.
And I have learned
so many other things too.
But now I can’t mention them all,
right?
Right? You are just…
Children?
If you don’t get full marks
in the test tomorrow,
then you may change my name.
Aristotle’s uncle!
You guys are laughing, yes?
Now you ask chocolates.
Concentrate on your studies.
And, you too?
I am going to iron grandmother’s clothes.
I have not done anything.
Come, show me your copy.
What are you doing?
Such bad homework?
What kind of handwriting is this?
I feel like tearing the copy apart.
Oh God! I am amazed.
How do people show attitude
on this quality of education?
Come here to me, fast.
Now do as I teach you.
Get it?
Look here.
You will add first.
Mano?
Then you will multiply.
If you need to ask anything,
ask your brother Maheer.
Mano?
Show me your book.
Show it to me.
Let me see what you are doing.
Oh God! I repent. God,
all the situation is same.
Go bring the eraser.
You will have to do it all over again.
Thankfully, I saw it.
Erase it all.
We will write it again.
Okay?
Erase it now.
The answer is…
Okay this one.
Grandmother?
What is happening?
I was downloading this beauty app.
But it’s not downloading.
Come show me, I will do it.
It’s easy.
You know the old one, right?
Yes, this one.
See this. You need to go here.
Yes.
Open this. Click this.
And the downloading starts.
Grandmother?
Yes?
I have such a big news for you.
Yes?
Your grandson…
Mr. Maheer…
Oh, child.
When he was a baby,
his mother passed away.
And his father went abroad.
And he got married again
after going there.
Exactly.
So that’s why my son was left alone.
And as much as he laughs and smiles,
in reality, he is totally sad.
He just keeps what’s in his heart,
to his heart.
He doesn’t share it with anyone.
Boys his age do fun
and gossip around.
And he has taken all responsibility
on his head.
And the responsibility has
made him serious.
Oh my God!
Did anyone ask him for tea or not?
He must be sitting without having tea.
Oh God!
Thankfully, everything is clear.
Otherwise, I would have done
so wrong.
I misjudged this poor thing.
Poor thing’s mother passed away.
And father?
He got married after going abroad.
He forgot about his living son,
and left him alone,
to face the world alone.
That is why…
That is why he made Ifrah his life.
But that is also my promise.
I will make Ifrah and
Maheer united.
From today onwards, in this house…
Rather no.
In this whole world, I am the biggest
supporter of Maheer.
I will support that great person.
I will never mind anything that
depressed person would say.
Grandmother?
You just say. I will give tea
to Maheer myself.
Just wait.
Look, Ifrah.
You will have to do a little effort, right?
You will have to do some efforts
in such cases.
Hey, I am with you.
Nothing will happen.
Yes, but you will have to be
a little courageous.
Yes, then what else? Now you will
have to be a little courageous. Right?
What are you doing here?
I have brought tea for you.
I will talk to you later on.
Hey, why?
You can talk in front of me
without hesitating.
Consider me your friend.
Share your problems with me.
I will solve them in minutes.
I am such an expert
in solving problems.
I will give you such a nice suggestion…
I don’t need any suggestion of yours.
Thank you.
Hey, what did you just say?
Knowledge and wisdom are not
lessened if shared.
They are rather increased.
I am seeing the actions
of your wisdom.
Bananas with the tea?
Nice combination.
Now see,
you don’t take care of yourself.
You burn your blood by drinking tea.
You are always tangled.
There are deep thoughts in your eyes.
Blankness on your face.
There is something else on your mind,
and something else at your tongue.
That is why I have brought
bananas for you.
Okay, so if I will have these bananas
dipped in the tea,
that will cure all my diseases?
Oh?
So, how many times in a day
should I take this dose?
No.
You don’t have to have bananas
with the tea.
I have brought biscuits with the tea.
You can eat bananas
anytime in the day.
Thankfully!
By the way, you are so lucky.
Now see, I have decided
to be friends with you. Yes?
[thinks]
Oh Allah!
I am not such a sinner. Please
don’t give me such a punishment.
What are you thinking?
You don’t worry.
From today onwards,
all your problems are mine.
Hmm.
Can I have my tea now?
Yes, yes. You can have it.
I like to have my tea alone.
Okay. So I should go?
By the way, I don’t mind
anything you say now.
Okay then I will leave now.
Enjoy your tea.
Who is she to give
suggestions to me now?
When you are done cleaning the vase,
then give me a cup of tea.
I am busy.
Come on, child, Rania.
Where are you busy?
I am so busy right now.
I need your bike keys.
Why?
Why the keys?
Rabel wants to go to the market.
I said I will drop you.
You know how to ride a bike?
You know how to ride a bike too?
Yes, totally.
You can have race with me.
Then I will tell you.
And now Maheer is even teaching me
to drive a car.
Well, give me your keys.
Here you go, child.
Drive carefully.
You don’t worry. I am not riding it
for the first time.
Right? Thank you.
What a girl she is.
And you gave her the keys so easily.
There is a limit.
She is such a cute girl.
Maheer is teaching her how to drive a car.
That means they are friends now.
Give me your mobile.
Give me the mobile.
Hello Moanna?
Do you know…?
Hmm.
Sister Rania,
you can ride a bike too?
Hey, I can even fly a plane.
That’s another thing that there is no guarantee
that whether it will return or not.
Will you teach me?
To fly a plane?
No, to ride a bike.
Oh, so you want to learn
how to ride a bike?
I will teach you.
You see.
It is so easy.
Here goes your key.
There you go with the kick.
Oh, hero?
Where are you going?
Are you alone or your father
has come too?
No, no.
I have come alone.
I came to say hello
to the sister-in-law.
Okay, okay. Then go.
Who has stopped you?
Yes.
Rania?
Shall we go?
Hey? When did you come?
I have just come.
For what did you come?
I wanted to meet the sister-in-law.
Okay, okay.
Now do you want to interview him
or shall we go?
Hey, Rania.
We will go in a while.
He is a guest. Besides,
no one pays respect to him.
Atleast let me ask him tea
or something.
Let’s go.
Okay.
If that’s the thing, then let’s go.
Come on.
Actually, brother was missing
sister-in-law so much.
Poor thing is sad.
Really?
Then didn’t he come himself?
He doesn’t like your grandmother,
that is why.
Hey?
You are saying bad things about
our grandmother in front of us?
Are you not ashamed?
No, sorry.
The truth slipped out of my mouth.
Be careful and sensible.
She just got angry over something wrong.
Otherwise, she has such a nice heart.
Yes, our father praises her
morality a lot.
He doesn’t go tired.
Sorry.
Let’s go.
It’s your house. You come.
Boy is not that innocent,
as much as I thought he was.
I told you I didn’t want
to come back now.
I want to stay at grandmother’s house
for a few days.
Why don’t you understand what I say?
And now I am even offended with him.
The other day, he sent such wrong things
to me over phone call.
What?
When did this happen?
You didn’t tell me?
I would have scolded both the son
and his father,
that they would remember
all their lives.
Anyway, I didn’t do that.
But now this boy is in my cage.
No, grandmother.
I am also tired of those
father and son.
They abuse me too.
Consider me against them.
I am not with them at all.
Don’t give me the punishment
for what they have done, please.
They got the money but
they didn’t learn the humanity.
Okay, mother. I will leave now.
Sit down.
Don’t you dare go back
without having tea.
Good families do not send guests back
without serving them anything.
Go say this to your father
after going back,
as long as he doesn’t come back here
and say sorry for all his ill doings,
till then,
I will not send Saman back.
But grandmother,
how will brother Arbab live without
sister Saman for this many days?
You shut up. What do you know?
You just interfere.
Go make tea.
Go.
Just look at her!
There she goes!
[thinks]
Mother, take care of my bike.
Child, Asia?
Yes, uncle?
Did you need anything?
No, I didn’t want anything.
I am seeing you.
What happened to you?
Yes? You are silent. What do you
keep on thinking about?
Nothing, uncle.
My heart is sad since Rani left.
There is nothing else.
Hey, let her come back. She has just
left a couple of days ago.
[…] Right?
If you say, I will ask her
to come back.
No, uncle.
Don’t call her back.
Rani child has to study a lot.
She has to become a big officer in the city.
Hmm.
When she will be done studying,
and will become a big officer,
uncle, this stain will be
washed away too,
that her father is alive
but doesn’t want to meet his daughter.
Then people will come to ask for
Rani’s hand-in-marriage from far away.
Then nobody will question this,
what did her mother lack?
That her father left her and
didn’t even ask about her?
If I would be alive, I will tell them.
You didn’t lack anything.
That ill-fated person was as such.
He considered all that glitter as gold.
Her daughter was born,
that ill-fated person didn’t even
come back for her.
Rania,
will make our dreams come true.
I just think about Rania only.
And Farah?
What is she doing this early
in the morning?
Hello?
Thank God, dude.
You called.
I was waiting for your call.
Now tell me.
Did things proceed further?
Yes, yes?
Really? Then?
Oho.
Hmm.
No, no. Listen, listen.
Don’t worry about me.
What are you doing, dude?
You tore my head off.
I am being dizzy.
What were you doing here?
Yes?
What were you doing here?
I can’t recall
what I was here to do?
Wow.
Why am I seeing everything blurry?
Seems like I am blind.
Oh God!
What is happening here?
We are fighting.
You can join too.
Then it’s fine.
I thought, may God forbid,
there is a friendly atmosphere here.
Carry on fighting.
Why did you disconnect the call?
Whose call was it by the way?
It was my friend Farid’s call
Do you want to talk?
Shall I? Yes?
No, no.
Why would I talk to him?
You just stay away from me.
To hell with this Farid.
She said it would be Ifrah’s call,
they must be planning.
