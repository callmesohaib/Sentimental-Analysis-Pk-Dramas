What is it?
Nothing.
Go and play, don’t stand here
This time you have hurt
my heart, Rania.
Buddy, are you mad?
There everyone is waiting for you,
and you instead of getting ready,
sitting and smiling.
Even Mr. Hammad has called four times.
I am coming. Come on.
and listen, get ready, look at your get up.
I am fine this way.
You cannot improve, man. Come on.
Rania,
I don’t see Ayaz.
Yes, because he is not here.
Why is he not here?
Go and check.
Hey Bebo, don’t ask me
to do anything right now.
Don’t go, just sit here.
Ayaz is here,
see he has such a long life.
Are you mad?
Sit here quietly.
You are going to get married
in a few days.
Act a little that
you are feeling shy.
Hey brother,
your son in law is here.
Come. Come my son
he looks so good.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Live long, how are you?
Absolutely fine. Absolutely fine.
So give the gift that you brought with
so much love, why are you feeling shy?
Gift?
For you Mian Jee.
Okay fine.
Son, your coat is unbuttoned,
button it up.
Yes, sir. Yes sir.
All of them?
Seema, what do you do?
what do you do?
that poor thing had brought the flower
for Bebo and not for Mian Jee.
Why did you have
to make an entry?
Their romance was about to start,
you ruined it.
Don’t lecture me.
Have you ever cared about your wife?
Given her any importance?
Then why should I care
about the emotions of others?
It is ruined, okay?
Fix it.
I would say don’t waste
the opportunity,
express your love
Yes, I don’t waste the opportunity
and express my love,
and she will go in front of everyone
and tell them about the bet,
and whatever respect
I have left it will be ruined too.
You don’t know Rania, Honey.
Brother, what do you want,
then?
I want that Rania accepts
my love with her heart.
Even if she says no
on the face of it,
but her eyes tell me
what is in her heart.
Impossible. Nothing like
that can happen.
You just start crying
on your failed love.
Man, you..
Guys, relax.
Don’t lose hope.
I have told you that
I will resolve this issue.
Honey, you are all talk
and no walk.
Since you have come you have been
saying you will fix it,
I will just tell you the plan,
you have nothing.
Shhh…let me think.
What is she doing?
I was thinking that on the occasion
of fixing Mona and Khaver’s date,
we fix Ayaz and Asma’s wedding date.
What do you elders think?
Rania, tell her no.
I don’t want to get married right now.
First I will have the engagement
with a big celebration,
then I will think about the marriage.
Then say no yourself.
Thankless people.
She is getting married and
she still is showing tantrums.
No, it is a good thought. Yes.
What do you say, sister?
Should we not at least fix Asma
and Ayaz’s date?
Hey, I would say that don’t delay
something good.
Let brother Rafiq Ahmad come,
then we will fix everything.
I don’t know where he is. Child,
Rania, call Saman and…
Yes, I will just call, mama.
Ask her where they are.
Mian Jee, I am sure he must be standing
at a sweet shop that sells organic sweets.
He is a show off, upstart.
Mama, I feel Khaver is washing his face
with a dish washing soap,
that is why he got late.
I want to clean your face
with the same too.
Don’t you dare say anything about
my future brother in law.
Do you understand?
I need to fix the teeka.
Let me fix the teeka.
If he likes this girl so much,
then why did he say no
to getting married.
They are always together.
These three are conspiring against me.
They are Mahir’s friends,
so they will try to make him win.
It is decided,
Mahir can never improve.
Just try to make Rania believe
your love for the last time.
If she says no,
then, I will start my drama.
Done.
Thank you, man.
Thank you so much Honey,
you are really good.
If mama finds out,
we will be in trouble.
I am going to talk
to Rania right now,
you people please pray for me.
May God give me success.
My boy,
go put your hand in the bee hive,.
Poor Mahir.
He is not that poor.
Come on, we have to support him too.
Where are they?
Why are they not here till now?
I will call and find out.
Yes, okay, leave my hand.
Rania can you come for a second,
I want to talk to you about
something important.
I don’t have time to waste,
go from here.
Rania, just listen to me
for two minutes,
I have to talk about
something important.
I told you, I don’t want to talk to you.
Go from here.
Bebo, ask her, please.
Go. when he is saying he wants
to talk about something important,
then go listen to him.
What is the problem?
I don’t want to hear it.
Rania, go and listen to him.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
Come on.
Listen, have you not seen Mahir
behaving weirdly with Raina?
Hey, I didn’t focus on that,
but I have thought on the issue of making
both of them one in future.
You have said something great,
but didn’t you feel that there is a serious
misunderstanding between these two? Yes.
Huh? Why?
I have been trying to search
for the answer of this why.
I will find out.
Shehanshah, you don’t look good
sitting on this sofa.
Go out, special guests are about to come,
bring them in.
Hey Mona, what special guests?
And do we need them
to inaugurate this place?
What do you mean?
It is my future in-laws.
Come on, be quick.
Yes, so when are they coming
for the first time?
They come daily,
why are you so excited?
You will see the insults with
which mama will welcome them
and they will consider
this their respect.
Okay, enough.
No need for all this nonsense.
Come on.
Come.
Where is Mona going?
She has gone mad.
Hello.
Hello everybody.
This daughter in law of mine.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello everybody. Hello.
Hello everybody.
Oh Mian Jee. Mian Jee.
Greetings. Mian Jee.
Mian Jee, how are you? are you fine?
I am fine. Is she the same?
Yes. Yes. She is the same.
Has she come for a function
at home or for the Oscars?
I feel that she is coming
from the Oscars,
she didn’t get it there, so now
she will receive the Oscars from us.
She is acting like
she has to make a speech.
Have a seat, Miss Sweetie.
It is enough. Sit. Sit. Sit.
Come, have a seat.
Mama, I was saying that
till brother Rafiq and everyone else
doesn’t come,
I will go and rest.
They are late anyway, when they come
I will come immediately.
Sit down,
don’t you see respectable
guests are here,
or do you feel you don’t deserve
to sit with them?
Sit down.
Dabeer.
Yes, Sweetie?
I think all the women of
your family are blind.
Why? What happened?
No one appreciated
my great gold jewellery.
Oh leave them,
I am praising you.
you look so good,
is it less?
It is really less.
Understand?
Viewers and listeners,
today’s respectable guests,
uncle Rafiq and my future prince,
are arriving.
You people become alert.
Make her sit.
Make her sit and have a glass of water.
What does she mean that we should be alert?
Will there be an attack here?
Hah.
Brother, what was I saying?
You two are talking about Mahir
and Rania, right?
I too came to talk
about both of them.
Huh?
I told you I don’t want
to hear anything.
Rania, please.
I admit it was my fault.
I realize it.
I am also embarrassed
on the mistake I made.
That is why I am apologizing to you.
I am sorry.
Please forgive me.
Okay fine. Fine.
I heard you.
I forgive you.
You really forgive me
with your heart?
Yes, this is my greatness
and don’t talk to me
on this topic again.
Oh God, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Rania.
You don’t know
what a big favour you have done on me.
Hey, I was thinking that someone stubborn,
uptight and arrogant girl will take some time.
What if she gets stubborn.
But thank God,
you agreed immediately.
Yes.
Rania, I love you.
He is now on the real topic.
This means my doubt was correct.
This was what they were planning.
Mahir, Honey and Salik were
talking about this and laughing.
He wants me to say
I love you as well,
but I wont get trapped.
I love you.
Where did this I love you come from?
Where did it come from?
Rania, why don’t you believe my love?
What do I lack? Tell me.
I am smart, I am intelligent,
I am a little handsome too.
The man who comes in the dreams of
thousands of girl is accepting his love for you, man.
Please agree. Okay.
See this, here.
I am sitting on my knees
and proposing you.
I love you.
Please agree.
Mr. Mahir,
I am not as stupid as you think I am.
So don’t speak this nonsense with me.
and think a hundred times before
you say this nonsense to me.
I think I will have to make her
admit on gun point.
So Mian Jee and mama,
this is the real thing.
Okay you did good,
at least you told us everything honestly.
What is this Mahir did?
Rania has no fault.
He has lost his trust himself.
Yes, but Mahir knows that he was stupid,
he made a mistake.
He is embarrassed, but
will Rania agree now or not?
This is the thing.
Never.
Mian Jee.
Yes?
Mama.
There is a solution for this problem.
If you want, I can tell you.
What? Go ahead.
You people announce
my wedding with Mahir.
What?
What are you saying?
I…this…
this date fixing came in front suddenly.
I couldn’t believe my ears.
I felt I was dreaming.
This sound?
Did you call the orchestra
to celebrate the date fixing?
No. The date has been fixed
in front of you.
This orchestra, this noise,
this turmoil, I don’t like it at all.
I am an introvert, someone
who stays quiet, listens to ghazals.
I often sit wearing a shawl,
I warm my hands, basically.
I feel some showoff has done this.
If you didn’t invite these people,
then who invited them?
Anyway, being happy in someone’s
happiness is also something good.
Shall we go?
It looks so good.
Yes.
Papa, they will be impressed
with us, right?
Hey, why wont they get impressed?
No one in their seven generations would
have come so grandly to fix the date.
Son, Arbab, get out
of the car and dance.
Papa, they are my in-laws,
I have some respect
in front of my in-laws.
Hey I too am asking you to dance,
and not beg.
Man…
Get off. Get off,
come on. Come on.
Papa, man…
Huh?
Dabeer, what are you doing?
Is this a way?
Learn something from your brother.
Mama, once the drum starts beating,
I cannot control myself.
You tell me, do you feel proud?
I find it really good.
You should have put some sense
in them, Saman.
Is this the way to come
to get the date?
Did you see your husband?
He looked like a monkey dancing.
You could have put some sense
in him or no?
Mama, you have sworn
to insult your sons in laws.
It is fine.
Arbab, you looked like
a fairy when dancing.
Come on.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Come on, lets fix the date.
Sister,
you should have at least arranged garlands
for the respectable guests.
Or you should have asked me,
I would have gotten garlands
for everyone with me.
Hey, what is the big deal in this?
Dabeer, take a necklace from
your wife’s neck and put it in his neck.
Okay mama.
Give me one.
Give the small one.
No. No sister.
Stop him.
I didn’t mean that.
You do something every time.
Sit nicely like a man now.
Respectable guests,
on today’s great day,
I want to make an important
announcement.
That my beloved, prince like,
my grandson, Mahir Ahmed,
I am fixing his wedding with my son Dabeer
and his wife Sweetie’s adopted daughter Honey.
So now soon those two
will be engaged as well.
Congratulations.
Hey, sit down.
Sit and clap. Sit.
Grandma, what are you saying?
I admit my life is lonely.
But fine,
maybe this is my fate.
So let my life be lonely.
I told you the decision has been made,
it is over. That’s it.
That’s it.
But grandma,
what is the need for all this?
My poor brother.
He knew,
no one would believe his love,
that is why he agreed to the family
out of helplessness.
Here you go, congratulations.
It has been confirmed.
The girl has gotten jealous badly hearing
about the news of the boy’s engagement.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to you too.
Hey boys, why are you sitting?
Dance. Dance a little.
Come on, get up.
Oh my,
look at this, why is Mahir
dancing madly like this?
Oh, look at that sad girl.
I didn’t expect this from Mahir.
I love you.
Where did this I love you come from?
Where did it come from?
Rania, why don’t you believe my love?
What do I lack? Tell me.
I am smart, I am intelligent,
I am a little handsome too.
The man who comes in the dreams of
thousands of girls is accepting his love for you, man.
Please agree. Okay.
See this, here.
I am sitting on my knees
and proposing you.
I love you.
Please agree.
On today’s great day,
I want to make an important
announcement.
That my beloved, prince like,
my grandson, Mahir Ahmed,
I am fixing his wedding with my son Dabeer
and his wife Sweetie’s adopted daughter Honey.
So now soon those two
will be engaged as well.
Oh,
what are you doing here?
Tsk. Tsk. Poor girl.
I know you got jealous of my Honey
and Mahir’s engagement.
I can see your face expressions.
For you it would be better
that you remove these expressions of yours.
You go from here, I don’t want to talk to you.
I too am not dying to talk to you,
but remember one thing,
that in future if you come around
my son in law in future,
then you will see the worst in me.
Understand?
Fix your tone.
I am not used to this tone
and words like these.
If I see you around Mahir again,
then my tone and words will be
worse than this.
If you weren’t Mrs. Dabeer,
then you cannot imagine how my words
and tone could have been.
I would have insulted you so badly that
you would have remembered all your life.
Right now, remember, you are talking
to Zaman Ahmad’s daughter.
If my daughter wants
then she can hire ten boys like Mahir
on the salary they want for her company.
Do you understand?
Papa.
I don’t want to go in front of
everyone inside.
Lets go back please.
What are you saying?
Hey, only weak people run hiding
their face like this
and if you get scared of what this cheap woman
said then you will be scared all your life.
I am thinking I will talk
to brother Dabeer immediately
and complain about
this woman’s behaviour.
No,
for my sake, you won’t do
anything like this.
Okay fine, I won’t say anything,
now come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come.
Today was a great day today.
First Mona’s wedding got fixed,
the date got fixed,
Then our Mahir’s wedding also got fixed.
Absolutely.
So now Asma and Ayaz are left.
Lets fix their date too.
Mama, finalize the date for
one month after Mona’s wedding?
One month?
No, no.
Yes, brother you are right.
it is really soon,
you will have to prepare.
Take six months.
Till then our children will also
have their summer vacations.
So when am I ringing the bell
at the school of the children.
I mean to say that where did the vacations
of the children come in between, sister?
Brother, what do you want?
Not soon, nor late?
Do you want to marry
our Bebo or not?
Hey, how can be in greater hurry
than me?
Ayaz. Ayaz,
can you sit quietly for a minute.
I mean this.
Mama…
Yes?
Is it possible that along
with Mona’s marriage,
you also marry Asma?
What do you think?
As you order.
What do you say, Zaman?
As you people see fit,
we can prepare for
the wedding in a week too.
In a week?
Hey, congratulations child.
Yes, congratulations
to you too child.
Congratulations to everyone.
Yes, to everyone.
My poor brother, he knew
that no one would have
believed his love,
that is why he agreed to the family
out of helplessness.
What is the matter?
You don’t look happy.
No…
The decision is correct, right?
Yes.
Sure?
We have fulfilled our daughter’s
responsibility in my life time.
Thank God.
And Ayaz’s sister said
something so good.
She said that,
we don’t need any show, we don’t
need any dowry, end of story.
They are smart people,
they are educated,
they would have made such a decision.
What else?
Absolutely right.
Mian Jee, I too have made a decision
and I hope you will appreciate
my decision.
What is that decision?
I have decided to fix
Rania’s proposal with Wasiq.
Such a big decision suddenly?
What is sudden in this, Mian Jee?
I had mentioned it to you.
No, I think you are being hasty, Zaman.
What is the haste in this, Mian Jee?
And I want such a great man
for my daughter.
Now see, Dr. Wasiq is a sober man,
he belongs to an affluent family,
he is a qualified doctor, Mian Jee,
and along with it
he owns a big property.
Rania will stay really happy with him.
Zaman, even now for you, property and
wealth have a lot of importance for you?
Huh?
I thought that your thinking would
have changed in all these years,
you are the same man.
I apologize, Mian Jee,
but in the end money is the
greatest wealth,
and this is the reality,
you cannot deny it.
Zaman, ask Rania once.
Hey, what do I ask Rania?
She is my daughter,
I will think of the best for her.
and she is a child,
what would she know?
Whatever decision that has to be made,
has to be made by me.
Huh?
Uncle, I was saying that this Wasiq
of ours is a good boy.
You think about your decision.
Okay?
I am,
I am thinking about it.
I cannot believe that
you are the same Rania,
who used to fight with anyone
in the village for their right,
and today it is about your right,
so you are quiet.
Who do I fight with?
With papa? And what for?
Look Rania,
I am not a child.
I know you don’t like Dr. Wasiq,
you…
Enough Bebo,
end this discussion here,
there is no point.
