Thank you for inviting me,
to be honest,
I’ve enjoyed after a long time.
I had stopped doing all this,
going to the gatherings like this.
Then you should keep visiting,
think of us as your family.
Just like how we think of you
as our family.
That is so nice of you Rania.
Hopefully I’ll be like this.
Hopefully.
The whole venue is empty,
all the guests have left,
only one or two are remaining.
We’ll rest once they leave,
we’re tired.
No, I’m not tired yet,
we’ll tease Mona all night.
Rania, allow me to go,
we’ll meet soon.
I’ll say it’s better to meet
the doctor as late as possible.
You’re humorous,
you’re good at jokes.
Bye Rania.
But, tea.
Some other day,
father is waiting for me.
Okay, but do tell father,
I would’ve liked if he had come.
Pay my regards to him.
Yes, sure.
Bye.
Bye.
Doctor, come let me walk you
to the door.
Yes, yes, let’s go.
No, no there, this side, come.
Did you see it yesterday?
Rania was giving a little too much
attention to Dr. Wasiq,
I don’t know what the conversation
was about that wasn’t ending.
I have been observing Mr. Mahir,
aren’t you getting a little sensitive
over Rania?
Walk a little carefully,
be cautious,
don’t confess your love she’ll reject.
Rania is a different type.
Oh Rania is pretentious,
she only pretends to be cold.
It’s my experience dude,
I’ve seen it in her eyes.
Secretly, she’s into me,
just like other girls.
She loves me, she’s always after me,
I’ve seen it.
You’ll see,
I’ll have her confess her love
by herself.
Do you bet?
Well, jokes apart,
she’s good at heart,
she thinks good for everyone,
she helps everyone.
She is a nice girl.
You are right.
I always knew how egocentric you are,
but I didn’t realize you think
that low of me.
I am sad,
I am disappointed in you,
I can never trust you again.
But I will never let you know
that I have seen your real face,
that I am aware of your mindset.
Rania,
what happened,
why did you bring back the tea?
I forgot the sugar,
it’s there now,
you can take it to them.
Listen?
What happened Rania,
is something to worry about?
You were crying?
No, why would I cry without any reason?
The tea is getting cold, please take it.
There is something, she’s not like this.
You’re down bad, Mr. Mahir.
You used to think this girl will also fall
for you one day just like other girls.
Instead you are the one madly
in love with her,
and there is no way back.
Hello.
Oh, hello, hello, hello?
Where are you lost?
I’m grilling the corns,
want some?
Why are you getting so rude?
I asked you a random question,
and such a bitter answer?
Because I am not a random girl and
do not mistake me for a random girl.
What happened to her,
she was fine till the engagement.
Mr. Mahir, you fell in love with her
and she got arrogant?
Are you studying?
Good,
you can ask me if there is anything.
Also I’m really good in.
This subject.
Oh, wow mother, wow,
vegetables and hooves.
Wow mother, I really
don’t want to go back.
Do you remember the time
when all you wanted was
to go to America,
I said no multiple times yet
you didn’t understand.
You got on the plane wilfully.
You are right mother,
I made a big mistake.
Well mother Pakistan has
also changed drastically,
people here are not like
how they used to be.
I would say people’s looks have changed,
their lifestyle has changed but the love
in their hearts, it’s the same.
Oh brother, you’re here, I have been
looking for you everywhere.
I need to talk to you about
something very important.
Yes, yes, tell me what is it?
Your younger brother.
What happened to him?
He is a 100% useless and idle.
Eat, sleep, repeat,
eat, sleep, repeat.
Bed to sofa to bed to sofa.
For God’s sake take him
to America with you,
make him work at a store,
do whatever you want.
Haven’t you asked
for something easy?
Like it’s a child’s play for me?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much,
I’ll tell the good news to Hammad.
Hey, hey Seema, wait a minute.
Tell me about it, mother.
What am I saying?
What is she comprehending?
Are you making tea?
A cup for me too.
Can you also fry an egg?
Half fry.
But please make sure
the yolk doesn’t break,
if it breaks then.
It’s hard to eat.
Why are you upset?
Have you taken a vow of silence?
You should mind your own business.
And you?
What about when you meddle in
everyone’s business, nothing about that?
I help them for their own good,
there is a big difference
between you and me.
What is the big difference,
we should also get to know.
Try telling me what’s in your heart,
who knows I might be able to help.
Only talk about things
you can control,
don’t brag all the time.
You fried a really nice egg.
It looks like you measured.
What did you do?
Why did you break the yolk, I told you
I don’t eat eggs with runny yolks.
Really?
Then make one for yourself,
because I can’t do anything else
for you at the moment.
Rania, Rania, stop.
Why are you so upset with me,
what did I do?
You would know what you did,
and I am like this,
do you have any objection?
Why would I have
an objection to that?
Stay whatever you are,
how does it matter to me.
Exactly.
Okay listen,
remember you said you want
to learn how to drive,
I am free today I can teach you.
I’m really good.
No, thanks.
Actually I have changed my mind,
I don’t have a car,
I’ll learn when I’ll have one.
And you shouldn’t really
with thinking about me,
because it won’t help you.
I don’t know what happened to her.
Sister, sister,
I want to talk to you about
something important.
Yes, I’m listening.
Sister, I have made a decision,
I’ll apply for a job.
What? Repeat that.
I can’t stay idle, sister.
Please arrange a job for me.
But you wanted to start
a business.
That was my childhood,
I’ve matured now.
You’re not kidding?
Serious, sister, a 100% serious,
whatever the job will be, I’ll do it.
Farhad,
have you been listening to
what your uncle is saying?
We should distribute the sweets.
Yes sure but I am trying to find out
how could he change suddenly.
You’re misbehaving?
What?
I’m 4 years older than you.
2 years.
You’re demotivating me after
I have made my decision to have a job.
Sister, do something sister,
make some arrangements.
Just think you’ve got a job.
I’ve got a job?
Yes, absolutely.
If I’ve got a job then
we should tease about marriage as well.
What? Is it a girl that we tease?
Ayaz, there is something, I’ve been
noticing something is different.
The wise man was right,
you can’t hide love
or fragrance.
What?
Love?
Love.
Oh, oh, God!
I thought he was getting on
a straight path,
he’s lost even more.
Ayaz, your love can go to hell,
I won’t let you marry anyone
without proper inquiry.
What happened,
you are lost in thoughts?
Nothing, uncle.
I am missing Bebo,
I’m sad, you should call her.
Should I serve you tea?
You’re so shy,
when you smile it seems like
the clouds are growling.
Rani.
Don’t announce there that
Bebo insisted so we came.
But you said you wanted to meet aunt,
what’s wrong if I tell them?
Don’t you understand
what I am saying?
I was getting bored at home so I thought
we should visit the neighbours.
Okay then let’s go inside.
Oh my luck, oh my luck,
great people are visiting today.
Well I was just thinking about you.
Why?
Because, b, that.
She’s a guest,
so that’s why,
if she’s feeling lonely.
Rabail isn’t here?
Oh, poor Rabail is stuck,
grandmother forbid her,
she told her not to visit
before marriage.
Okay, that’s fine.
There, your student is waiting for you.
Where?
There, sitting right there.
Laiba.
That’s a great custom at your house,
before you also get
the same restrictions,
I should show you around.
Randomly, just to know the house.
What are you talking about?
Very serious,
I have applied for a job Asma.
The place where I applied had
so many referrals
and I was the only one on merit.
They took my interview,
the boss asked if I had a source,
I said no, I gave a really good interview.
When sister calls, then they’ll hire me
because it’s sister’s company.
So she was saying
it will be confirmed.
That is a really good news.
As soon as I’ll get the job
I’ll get sweets for you.
Didn’t you get informal a little too fast?
Enough time is wasted already,
so why shouldn’t we do everything soon.
Come, let me show you around
before you get restricted.
These plants.
Let me go tell the mother.
What?
That you came.
Oh, yes, let’s go.
What is this matter?
There is a whole film going on right under
my nose and I didn’t find out?
That’s enough,
but am I misunderstanding?
No,
I don’t know.
Rania, can I tell you some good news?
This brother of mine,
has completely changed.
He’s changed? How?
He has started talking wisely,
he wakes up early in the morning
and goes jogging,
even has breakfast on time.
And he is even worried about a job,
also he has been pleasant lately.
He’s even humming sometimes.
Sister, mention the poetries also,
the ones I say.
Yes, yes, he has also been doing poetry.
If you don’t mind can I say a couplet?
Yes, yes, say it.
The couplet goes,
This love isn’t easy, think of it as.
This love isn’t easy,
think of it as.
It is a river of fire and
you have to dive in it.
Drown, drown.
Drown in it, drown in it,
the same thing.
Wow, wow, another one uncle.
Another couplet by Meer Sard.
He said it in the winters of Siberia.
It’s cold.
Box in a box, box in a box,
cake in a box.
Box in a box, cake in a box.
My neighbor, one in a million.
Wow, loved it,
it was amazing.
Let’s have another one.
Another couplet...
Ayaz, Ayaz, stop, enough for today.
Okay sister.
Well aunt, uncle has changed completely.
Yes, I think he is in love with someone.
Love? love,
with whom?
That’s what we have to find out.
But it isn’t difficult for me
I will find out the girl.
Okay whenever you find out,
you have to tell me.
It is not something to mention,
I will tell you and if the girl is nice,
we will take the proposal.
We will take aunt as well.
Yes, why not.
No, not Bebo, not Bebo,
Bebo will be there,
I mean both of you will be there,
and Bebo too, we’ll all be there.
Yes, we will be together,
will be together.
I have a collection of some rare books,
if you have some spare time,
can we go to the library? Both of us?
Let’s go?
Grandmother, what are you doing
here sitting alone?
My child, my reports have
arrived from the hospital,
I want to show them to Dr. Wasiq.
I’ll send it to him
when Mahir arrives.
To Dr. Wasiq?
Master, should I get you lunch?
Go away.
Master, you haven’t taken
the medicine yet,
and the doctor said.
I told you to go,
and don’t try to scare me with doctors.
Yes.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Wasiq is at the hospital,
you can visit him there.
But I’m here to meet you.
Me?
I don’t like to meet people
nor do I feel the need to.
But I really need to meet you.
I mean,
I am here to tell you
why I wanted to meet you.
Just give me a few minutes,
please.
You won’t go without saying
what you want.
Come on.
Actually, my father has died,
I have only seen him in pictures.
When I saw you for the first time,
it felt like my father came alive
from the pictures in front of me.
I swear uncle,
believe me,
I am telling the truth.
Your face exactly resembles
my father’s.
Maybe that’s why,
I want to be in your company,
keep talking to you.
Yes, but there is nothing
unusual about it,
I mean a lot of people resemble
each other,
they have some similarities.
But you know the truth
so you know that your father
is not alive anymore.
Still coming after a man like this,
who isn’t even related to you,
it isn’t appropriate for a girl like you.
You don’t have a daughter
maybe that’s why you can’t understand
what my feelings are.
You don’t know the importance
of a father for his daughter.
No, it is nothing like this.
I mean to say,
I understand your feelings
but I can’t do anything about them.
I can just advise you,
learn to face the reality.
Look, you are a really nice girl,
don’t run after an illusion like this.
Now go,
go to your home.
Yes.
Bye.
And listen,
take care of yourself.
Does my daughter also look for
my reflection in every random stranger?
Feels my absence just like this?
Your neighbors are such nice people,
I really liked them,
very welcoming and sociable.
Really good.
Right? Everyone is so nice
and that family.
Well how did you like meeting Farhad?
Farhad is also nice,
but his uncle, he’s really nice.
You liked uncle?
Why? He’s not nice?
Where’s Rania?
Rania isn’t home,
you can tell me if there is something.
Why would I have something?
What work of mine stops
if Rania isn’t there?
I was just randomly asking,
and Bebo did you notice one thing?
This Rani does not stay home,
like it’s okay if you know
how to ride a bike, it’s okay,
but that doesn’t mean you can go anywhere,
anytime whenever you want.
One should also stay at home,
right?
What happened,
don’t say this.
Grandmother is not well,
she went to Dr. Wasiq.
Dr. Wasiq,
it seems like there is only Dr. Wasiq
in this whole city
who has been blessed by God to have
some special cure for everything.
The patient, even before
getting his medicine,
gets cured just by getting
in front of him. Wow.
When Rania returns,
you should tell her,
these Dr. Wasiq type people are really
frauds and scammers.
How do you know
if his degree is real or fake?
I really don’t like Dr. Wasiq.
Why does he have a problem
with Dr. Wasiq?
He’s right,
he does not have any relation with me,
only his face resembles my father.
But my face doesn’t resemble
any of his sister or daughter.
The way I think emotionally of him,
he cannot think like that.
Rania,
what happened?
Why are you sitting like this,
alone? Sad?
I’m not sad.
That, Mahir was asking for you.
You’re also an idiot,
just go wherever you want,
don’t you have to ask for permission?
I took permission from grandmother.
And this complain?
Mahir must’ve said this?
No, no, he was just asking,
he was worried for you.
He does not care about me,
he just pretends.
He just wants everyone
to do as he says.
Why?
Is he our grandmother?
What does he think of himself?
Random.
You both were friends till yesterday?
You both insulted that
poor Khawar together.
And today you are talking about him
as if he is your old enemy.
There was no friendship between us,
and a girl like me can never be friends
with someone arrogant like him,
he’s a hypocrite.
There is nothing like that,
he is a nice guy.
Yes, as if you’re really good
at recognizing people.
What is your problem?
Did you have a fight with someone?
No.
Rania, listen to me.
What are you going to say
and what do I listen?
What I have heard is enough,
that’s why always remember,
a person is not what he seems like.
Rania?
Such an idiot she is.
It’s my turn now, stop it.
You’ll get powder on your face you
already have enough.
Don’t worry, we’ll defeat them.
Oh damn.
Wow, wow.
Here you go.
I wish you had brought sister-in-law along,
I really want to meet her.
Oh I came in a hurry,
I’ll bring her the next time I’ll visit,
also she’s currently on bed rest.
Think because you speak,
you’ve returned after 20 years,
if your woman were that obedient,
you would’ve returned after 20 years?
Oh, mother, what are you saying.
It’s not casual,
your son has a lot of command and
respect over Sweetie, yes.
If I growl once,
your daughter-in-law shivers like this,
like this, yes.
It’s all about fate brother,
I can’t even think of this dominance.
But our fate isn’t that beautiful,
I’d say mothers should ask for son’s
good fate as much as daughter’s.
Mother, I think you didn’t pray
enough on my time,
this is what I got as a wife.
Stop this, stop,
it’ll get very difficult for you to sit here
if I start my sad stories.
This is a voice,
the bed is calling you,
it isn’t used to staying alone without
you for a long time.
Are you seeing this brother?
This, this is what she does to me.
Every time, this,
I swear, enough.
Hey my child,
wives don’t respect for no reason,
a man should have a skill for that.
Do one thing, try to adopt my personality,
then you’ll see.
Hey, make your move.
Brother, I’m having a headache.
Are you seeing this mother?
Can you see?
Learn, learn something
from your elder brother.
Your wife already does not respect you,
and when he will come
that Khawar, rat alike,
he won’t even count you as anything.
And I won’t tolerate that,
I’m warning you.
It has been 20 years mother,
the way she used to respect me
the first day,
she still respects me the same way.
There isn’t even an increase,
I mean a decrease in that.
Hey mother, your son has her
on a tight leash.
Mother, when I talk to her
in a firm tone,
minus 20-degree centigrade,
negative, it’s ice cold mother.
It’s a luxurious house.
The car is also big,
must’ve taken a lot of my dollars.
Dabeer, you’re gone.
Hello? Madam,
who are you?
Inside without permission?
When I scold her,
she starts sweating.
I have her in control.
Good job.
I’ve tightened her leash.
What stray cat is that?
Oh sister, stop.
Mother, she’s a strange woman,
came straight to the house
without even introducing.
Seems like she’s short on hearing.
Mrs. Sweetie, you’re here?
Sweetie.
Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie.
Sweetie has arrived.
I’ve gone crazy to see you,
in happiness, in happiness.
How happy I am,
to see you.
You were always mad,
I was blind who couldn’t see.
She’s joking.
Sweetie, you’re here for the first time,
after so long, greet them.
Greetings.
Greetings Sweetie sister-in-law.
Sweetie, mother, Sweetie.
Greetings.
Greetings, my elder daughter-in-law
has arrived.
Yes Sweetie.
Come, Sweetie.
Have a seat.
Sit, sit, sit.
Introduce me to your mother
who is very sick,
bedridden and you’re on her bedside
looking after her day and night.
His mother is alright and healthy,
tell me about yourself,
your leg was fractured?
Mother is asking how are you?
Yes your leg, it fractured into pieces,
it healed so soon?
It’s really delicious,
really yummy, eat.
Leg will be fractured now,
but not mine, someone else’s.
That means you’ve been lying to me?
For the last 20 years, you had been
in such pathetic company
that you’ve learned to lie?
Mother, I, I, I should go get Seema.
Not only Seema,
call everyone to come
and see what a wonder came
to our house.
Sweetie, mother, sweetie.
Yes, call everyone.
Listen, you’re visiting your in-laws
for the first time,
you should be wearing
something appropriate.
What would people say?
People will come to meet you.
Everyone in this house wear
nice clothes because of me.
Dabeer, I really liked
this new house of mine.
Yes, it’s really nice, it’s very good.
Dabeer why are you standing
there like a cow?
The owner of this house came
for the first time,
go get me a cold drink.
Hey, I’m reminded of my father’s farm
from cows of Sahiwal.
Servant, leave the cold drink,
get me a chilled lassi.
Go, go fast.
And add malai on the lassi.
I used to make lassi
by myself, like this.
Hey, sister Rania,
sister Rabail.
Go and see,
what arrived from America.
What arrived?
I mean, see who came.
Who came? Let’s go and see.
I think this house will face
an apocalypse soon.
What nonsense is this?
What apocalypse?
What happened to him,
come let’s see.
So many people,
is it a home or a guest house?
Don’t put an evil eye on my family
All this family is being fed in this house?
What problem do you have?
Excuse me I am talking to my husband
so you should keep quiet.
Dabeer, what am I seeing?
So many people,
that’s why my dollars get stolen
every now and then.
Sweetie, be considerate.
What do I care about?
It seems like this house has
a whole wedding party.
The wedding will also happen, soon.
What? Dabeer,
what am I hearing?
Hey Sweetie,
I’m becoming your fan,
what a hairstyle, what a beauty,
what a dressing, wow.
Thank you,
well these comments are not new to me,
I’ve been hearing these compliments
since an early age.
Who is this, someone please introduce.
Why would someone else introduce
I can introduce myself.
Me, myself Sweetie,
came from America
and I’m the owner of this house,
where all of you are staying
without my permission.
Mr. Dabeer introduce everyone,
why are you hiding in the back?
Yes, yes, why not Sweetie,
why not.
This, the one sitting in front of you
is my beloved mother.
Yes, the one who didn’t like my arrival,
anyway carry on.
This, this is Shehenshah,
he’s not our servant
more like our son.
This is Seema, my sister-in-law,
along with her is my younger brother,
what was your name?
Hammad, Hammad.
Hammad, Hammad.
These are his two children.
This is Mano, this is Tipu.
After that, it’s Rania,
Rania is, mother’s cousin
who is just like a brother to her,
she’s his granddaughter.
And this, the sister of mine who died,
she’s her daughter.
And that Mona,
she’s Seema’s younger sister.
And the beautiful girl standing
on your right side,
she’s mother’s adopted brother’s cousin
sister’s daughter.
Mr. Dabeer, is it all or some
of your relatives remaining?
Wait a minute, Sweetie,
let me breathe.
You forgot to introduce him my crown.
Yes, this is my son, Mahir.
So this is the prince
that calls every week to annoy us
about the dollars.
