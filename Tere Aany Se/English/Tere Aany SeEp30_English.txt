What's the matter Bebo,
smiling like this alone in the kitchen?
Everything alright?
Nothing, I just remembered a joke.
Joke?
Tell me, I'll also laugh.
No, it wasn't that good,
leave it.
I'm just cutting some fruits for father,
doctor strictly asked to feed him fruits,
even if he denies it.
You're cutting these for grandfather?
Bebo,
can I go and give them
to grandfather? Please.
Why,
do you want to add your points?
Something like that, please.
Okay, take them,
and tell him you cut these,
I won't tell anyone.
Wow, you are a great woman,
I would say we don't have
such a woman nowadays,
May God fulfill all your wishes
as well as mine.
Thank you.
Hey,
tell me what is the wish of your heart?
Why are these attempts
of flattery on father?
If a boy is looking after
the elders of the house,
then what could be the purpose?
I get some of it.
You're getting it right,
it's such a difficult mission,
pray to God to make me successful.
Okay.
He's a nice guy,
he'll also look good
with Rania as a pair,
but where is Rania?
Hello?
Yes my child, greetings.
How are you, everything alright?
It's good?
Did Sweetie create some turmoil
behind my back?
Oh, no, no, no, mother,
she's managing everything with
so much integrity and skills,
you'll be surprised to see this
on your return.
Sweetie is managing
the house really well.
Okay, I'll believe it if you say so,
but it's quite unbelievable.
Tell more.
If I'm telling you it must be true,
okay tell me mother, how is uncle?
Look mother, if uncle needs money
for treatment
then tell me, I'll bring it myself.
Live long, live long.
Okay then, greetings.
What were you saying?
Greetings.
Before that,
you were talking about
the treatment of some relative,
you were offering them my dollars?
No, no, there is nothing like that Sweetie.
I just said it randomly.
How can it be randomly?
It's the same example,
you went to spend when you didn't
have a penny in your pocket.
If you're having such sympathies
with your relatives
then admit him to some charity hospital.
Turn down your volume Sweetie.
Why would I turn down the volume?
Why would I turn the volume down,
did I ask for a debt from someone?
Or am I eating by borrowing
from someone?
Sister-in-law, sister-in-law,
shout a little low, please.
Seema did all the house chores,
scolded me,
and now went to sleep peacefully,
if she wakes up again
she'll start attacking again,
so please, slow.
Tell me how to yell slowly?
And your Seema,
how did she sleep at this time?
Now who'll reheat the food for me?
Me, I'm here, your husband,
I'll reheat it for you, Sweetie.
Oh no sister-in-law, I'm here
I'll reheat the dinner for you, me.
Why would you do that?
I'm her husband,
I have the responsibility
to look after her
and reheat the food,
are you her uncle?
Oh, brother what happened,
I'm a brother-in-law,
if I reheat food for sister-in-law
it'll be my duty,
give me a chance to earn
a good deed.
No, no, no, no, I'll reheat the food,
you can leave it.
Oh no, brother it’s my duty,
I'll reheat the food.
Duty can go to hell,
it's my right I am the husband I'll get it.
Oh no, brother, it's my duty
I'll reheat the food, end of discussion.
It's my right.
First it's my duty.
First it’s my right.
Oh no.
Right first.
Duty is first.
Right.
No brother.
Shut up,
you make a drama out of everything.
I hate arguments, I'll go and
reheat the food myself.
Here you go,
let's make it our routine,
it'll save us.
As you say brother, as you say.
Okay go and get the bottle.
Oh water bottle, of cold water,
I'm thirsty that's why I'm asking.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing,
I am getting bored, what else?
I came all the way for
an inconsiderate girl to her village,
and her welcome?
Oh wow, what do I tell.
I didn't ask you to come,
but still you drove me here
because of my problem,
thank you for that.
I'll try to return that favour
some time in my life.
Return the favor later madam,
I'm visiting your village
for the first time,
show me around.
There is nothing according
to your luxury here.
Neither me nor my village.
What are you talking about Rania?
You're a daughter of such
a rich millionaire father.
I'm not anyone's daughter,
I'm only my grandfather's granddaughter.
Only your grandfather's granddaughter?
Then prove it.
There is no need for proof in love,
grandfather knows
I love him the most.
And you don’t need to get worried
about my concern,
I'll talk to grandfather by myself,
he'll understand me.
I know this.
Rania, tea.
Thank you,
put it here I'm busy right now.
Have it, it'll get cold.
And why are you packing your bag?
I'm going back.
You're going back and
you didn't tell me?
Why would I tell you?
Because I am also getting bored here,
I'll do this, I'll go to grandmother
and tell her clearly
that if you want to stay here you can,
but I'm going.
If you want to go then go gladly,
but I'll never go back with you
no matter what.
Wow,
you can come with me
but can't go back?
Why?
Then, grandfather's condition made me
worried that's why I had to come.
Now that he's better,
and happy with his son,
I'm going.
Rania since when did you
start talking like this?
You used to settle other's matters,
what happened now,
can't settle your own matter?
Because I don't want to
settle this matter.
Did you hear that?
You're a strange girl,
it's very difficult to understand you.
So who asked you to do
a research on me?
Rania,
you don't care about
anyone's feelings at all?
You do?
Then go and tell them to consider you
as their daughter from now.
Ask forgiveness from God,
who's talking about those feelings,
I was talking about my feelings.
Your?
Feelings?
You're one of those
who only live for themselves.
Your ego gets hurt on every small thing,
and only take a stand
for their own rights,
whatever they do it's for them,
their benefit.
I don't want to waste my time
on a person like you,
do you understand?
Rania.
You really think that about me?
Yes, that's what I think about you
and it won't change.
You've lost the bet Mahir,
go and celebrate your loss
with your friends
because Rania Ahmed didn't fall for you.
My child, I don't want to force you
but my health is declining
and I get worried for you.
I don't have the strength or time,
I'm a man of limited time now,
a collapsing wall,
and at this moment if I have something
to worry about, it's you.
I always want you to live
under a cool shed.
Grandfather,
I don't want to live under a shed,
I want to be the tree
that provides shelter to others.
The confidence and teaching made me able
to fight back in any kind of situation.
You shouldn't worry about me.
So you won't forgive him?
Whenever I try to move towards him,
my feet sink to the ground,
my heart gets failed with complaints,
he didn't do right by us.
I want to forgive him
but I am not able to.
Mother's sad eyes,
your never-ending hard work,
my orphan childhood,
how many things do I forget?
No my child,
I don't want to force you,
do you understand?
Zaman did us wrong,
but when your heart longs for love
and love wins over resentment
then forgive him.
Are you mad at me?
No my child,
you're my life,
how can anyone be mad at you?
Hey sister.
Tell me fast what news did you bring?
Wait a minute.
What you asked me to do,
I did it honestly. I swear on you.
I met big lawyers, just for you.
That's alright but tell me
did they give some hope?
Yes but there is a problem,
everyone repeated the same thing,
all of them are saying that if you try
to have this legal battle you will lose.
I mean you'll be disgraced,
and you won't be able to prove
that this house, this car,
this chair, this couch is made
with your dollars.
What? My foot.
Dollars are very powerful,
haven't you heard?
Might is right.
And I have the power of dollars.
Sister, you could have told me earlier,
you casually waste in my time.
What do you mean?
I gave you Dollars to do this job.
Madam Sweetie,
I meant to say that
the time I wasted in running
after the lawyers
I wouldn't have done that.
We could've come up with some cunning
and clever plan on our own.
You're right,
I'll also make such a plan,
everyone will be surprised,
and then all of this will be in my hands.
Aunt you could've stayed a little more,
we were all enjoying
your company here.
My child, Dabeer and
Sweetie are there alone,
I don't know what turmoil
she could've created there.
Live long, live long Zaman,
take care and do visit in Lahore.
Aunt.
Yes my child, you too,
you both really took care of me,
looked after me and Rania so much.
I've tried a lot,
but my mind cannot accept
reviving a dead relationship.
Take care of yourself.
Why did you stop the car?
Grandmother,
I'm in love with this place,
look at it,
such beautiful views and fresh air.
I feel like staying here, let me get out.
Come Rania, let's walk.
No, I don't feel like.
What's the matter, you seem upset,
what happened?
Nobody forced you for anything
whatever you decided,
you did it on your own.
Then why are you sad?
Why are you worried,
go look at how beautiful the place is,
such fresh air.
Go, go, have a look.
Look, I want my old Rania back,
the one who always smiled
and laughed,
listen you've always been
my brave girl, right?
Then throw away all these worries
outside and go enjoy, go.
Then you should also come.
How can I go? You both should go.
Come.
Go, go.
Carefully.
Grandmother we'll be back after a walk.
Go, go.
What is this?
This, this is wheat.
Okay,
and that, there is a swing,
can we go there?
Why?
You haven't seen a swing before?
Also, grandmother is alone,
so leave it.
Grandmother.
Yes.
Rania is saying you're alone
in the car,
that's why she isn't going far.
Oh, who'd take away this old lady?
You both can go enjoy,
and Rania, show this kid around, go.
Come on kid,
let me show you around,
and if you do anything mischievous
nobody would be worse than me,
and anyway this is my area nobody
would come to save you.
Who even wants to be saved.
What did you say?
Nothing, now you look like my Rania.
Come.
Hello Rania.
Hey, what's up?
Wow, you're speaking a lot of English,
talk to them in their local language
so they could understand.
What do you think, they don't get it?
These are very hardworking
and intelligent girls,
no matter what language you speak,
they'll understand.
What happened Rania?
Why do you get sad so often?
You’re serious again.
Look,
what you’re feeling, I know,
I can understand.
Frustration, anger,
but things will get better with time,
give it some time.
Do one thing,
share your feelings with me,
I’ll listen to everything like
a good friend,
but please don’t get sad like this.
You came into this world
to solve other’s problems.
Really?
And my problems?
Who’d solve them?
You, yourself.
Who could be smarter than you.
You’re buttering?
Oh no, I’m telling the truth.
You’re being wise today,
where did the sun rise from?
From Khushalpur.
Rania time is the best teacher
of person’s life,
it teaches us everything.
You can look at me,
till yesterday I was a rich and
wealthy person on my own
and used to think the power of money
is greater than everything.
And today? I’m empty-handed,
I have nothing,
but I have a vision,
now I’ll get everything in life.
I’ll get a lot of success and
earn a lot of money,
but on my own.
And you,
you never respected money,
never gave any importance
and now look
today you’re a daughter of
such a rich man.
I’m so happy for you.
I don’t have any interest in my father
or his wealth.
Yes but he’s your father,
you accept it or not,
but it’s true,
that you can’t deny.
Can we go now?
Grandmother is alone in the car.
So soon?
It’s been too long.
I didn’t even remember the route,
we should roam around, sit for a while.
There is a shortcut, I’ll tell you, come on.
Okay.
Thank God you’re back,
I missed you so much.
You came back at the right time,
if you were a few days late
you would have lost the authority
to this house.
This house didn’t feel like home,
it felt like a prison
as if we’re the prisoners sentenced
without a crime.
Nobody is born who could
take over my place.
How did she become a jailer,
I was absent for a few days and
she believed herself to be an owner.
I’ll let her know,
my name is Azra Jahan
and I’m not even afraid
of someone’s father.
Yes, here we go,
grandmother got her full rage
and now we’ll have a chaos.
Call everyone.
Come on everyone,
you got an invitation.
Greetings, greetings, greetings.
I’ve missed you guys a lot.
We also missed you.
Next time I visit my village,
you both should come,
I’ll also take you for a ride on my pickoo.
Really? I didn’t get that offer?
I offer according to people’s faces.
Mother,
mother, welcome home.
Welcome home, welcome home.
Oh my child, my Hammad.
Mother we missed you a lot, what do I tell.
Really?
Ask Rabail, ask children.
This house became a hell.
Oh I can smell my mother.
Oh my mother is back, this house
seemed silent without you.
Oh mother, you’re back I’m so happy,
I missed you so much.
Mahir, my son, the house was
deserted without him,
I missed him so much.
Why?
What why?
You’re Dabeer’s son
so you’d be my son as well.
Husband, wife and a child,
family complete.
Hey, you’ve gotten so weak,
you didn’t get proper food there?
You must be getting lentils or vegetable,
they’re poor relatives.
Yes you’re right,
they didn’t have food like our house,
they had healthy diet there,
chicken from their own farms daily,
cattle from their farm, wow.
If start getting the same food at our house
then in a few days your dollars would….end.
Very funny,
your sense of humor is really good Mahir,
such people are really
appreciated in America.
Seema go and serve the food,
mother and my son must be tired,
if you would’ve told me earlier I could’ve
prepared something nice for you.
You’d prepare food?
Then who else prepares the food?
Go set the table.
Excuse me.
Rania, you should also go and
help Seema in the kitchen.
Yes.
Wait Rania,
you’re tired,
you travelled so much, you’d look good
working in the kitchen?
Go take rest.
Yes Rania, you should rest,
I’ll help, come on Shehenshah.
Come, come fast.
Tell me more darling Mahir,
how was the travel,
did the car run smoothly?
Did my baby get tired?
Dabeer, why is she acting
like this with Mahir?
Mother, leave her on her own,
you should sit comfortably I’ll give you
a foot massage you must be tired.
Mother, I can also give you
a foot massage.
Really? Then get on it, let’s see.
Oh God, come on.
Listen to me,
you eat equal to a whole crew
and you have no strength
in your hands.
Massage properly,
more, more strength,
yes.
Seema, Rabail, serve the dinner fast,
the gases are going to mother’s brain
because of empty stomach. Hurry.
I won’t have dinner for a while,
for an hour, you massage my feet.
Yes properly.
Wow, your village is so beautiful Rania.
The people are also very beautiful.
Yes but not more than you.
What?
No, no, nothing, look at this picture,
this is from Rania’s house.
She has such cute parrots and pigeons.
Aww, they’re so cute,
Rania if you didn’t take me next time,
I won’t talk to you.
Done, you should come with me
the next time.
Sure?
Me too?
No, not you.
Next time, not you,
I will take you both along with me.
Aren’t you getting too informal?
Then let him be,
my brother Mahir doesn’t get
informal with anyone anyway,
what’s wrong if he’s getting
informal with you?
There are more pictures, see.
Oh wow, whose house is this?
This, remember I told you about my friend.
Don’t sit here, and go away from here.
What happened Rabail,
why are you talking
to Shehenshah like this?
You don’t know, I’ve been noticing him
for a few days,
he’s always after aunt Sweetie,
I think he tells our stories to her.
Shehenshah.
What is this?
Sister, you gave a space in your house
to an orphan like me,
you think of me as a part of a family
instead of a servant,
made me sit with you
on the dining table.
How could you even think
this Shehenshah would deceive you?
Sister always remember,
I’m a pathan,
once I’m loyal to someone
I can give my life
but won’t do treachery.
I agree I have a big appetite
but I only eat halal,
I won’t even consider haram stuff like this.
I was with her only for the purpose
of finding out
what she’s planning next and
saving you from the upcoming danger.
Shehenshah.
Shehenshah.
You’re like a brother.
Well from all these things,
it seems like the part about
your appetite came from the heart.
Shehenshah, I’m sorry,
please forgive.
Forgiven.
Take a seat Shehenshah.
Shehenshah, what’s aunt Sweetie
planning next?
Sweetie was telling,
she changed her strategy,
that if she couldn’t get her way easily
then she’ll twist her plans.
What are you talking about,
tell us clearly what’s the plan?
Brother Mahir,
you’re in a great danger,
she’ll trap you by pretending to love you
to get everything from you,
and you’ll be stuck there,
you won’t be able to do anything.
She laid out this trap already,
Tell us what she is planning next?
Sister I don’t know all the details
but I know one thing,
no matter if she loves or she hates,
it will be a loss to brother Mahir.
Brother Mahir, you’re very unsafe,
she taught this English to me.
Brother, what are you thinking now?
We don’t know anything Rabail,
what’s going to happen next.
But I can’t live in a place that has
so many conspiracies going on,
I have to leave this house.
Thank you so much Shehenshah.
It’s enough now, I’ve decided,
that today I’ll leave her house.
But Mahir a person like you,
who has always seen a prosperous life,
spent a good like,
how can you leave all this
and live alone?
I don’t know,
but I can’t tolerate all this,
I’ve never spent my life like this,
so much of tantrums so many taunts,
and earlier she used to taunt and
how suddenly a change of behavior.
I’m understanding everything,
why is there a change,
and father had told me earlier
that all the dollars he sent
belonged to aunt Sweetie,
I swear to God I wouldn’t have
asked even once.
And now the family property and
the money they sent is all mixed,
we never kept a tally of it.
Okay don’t worry,
if you don’t want to stay here,
my house is available to you,
we’ll live in the same house,
we’ll share a room, what else?
I never would’ve thought,
I’d have such situations,
I did understand
that she was playing a game,
she wanted to manipulate me into
signing the property documents.
Brother Mahir,
just stay on your word,
don’t get deceived,
she shouldn’t get this property
because this is also your family inheritance
which would be a lot more than
the dollars they sent.
That’s true,
only God knows what will happen next.
Share your feelings with me,
I’ll listen to everything like a good friend,
but please don’t get sad like this.
You came into this world
to solve others’ problems.
Where are you lost?
You’re thinking about your father, right?
Why are you hurting yourself,
why don’t you forgive him?
Do you even know what he did,
how can someone do this
to their child?
I can’t forgive him.
Rania these relationships are
really precious
don’t look away from them,
look at me,
I don’t have a mother or father,
ask me the importance of
these relationships.
But I had,
but he left me,
and now that I’ve learned
to live without him
then why would I accept him?
Rania, it’s a really big decision,
give yourself some time, try to understand
then make a decision
and then some decisions are made
by time for us.
Grandmother was telling
he lives in the same city.
Yes, he lives with Dr. Wasiq,
I’ve met him often,
I didn’t know
the person I was meeting because of
my dead father is actually my dead father.
The one who rejected me
in my childhood.
Does that mean Dr. Wasiq
is your brother?
But he seems older than you.
Okay, so that means uncle
had already married earlier.
Oh no, he’s not my brother,
he’s a son of some friend of father’s,
but lives with my father.
Well,
don’t worry,
you’ll see God will solve
all your problems soon.
Ameen,
you’re really nice.
Thank you.
Listen, Mahir hasn’t returned
since the morning?
Yes it’s been a while,
he went in the morning
now it’s evening,
he should’ve been back,
I don’t know where he is.
Then call him and find out,
it’s not right to disappear like this.
You’re right, I’ll call.
Yes.
Let me ask where is he?
Mahir hasn’t returned,
we should be the ones worried about
it because we are his family, not you.
But sadly, you aren’t,
so let me worry.
Listen to me girl,
you’re here only for a while
don’t think of yourself
as a part of this family,
do your work and get on your way back,
do you understand?
Rest depends on me
and my son.
Your son?
Rabail are you seeing this change?
Aunt, this changed
the behavior of yours,
isn’t being digested by any of us,
it seems like there is a bell
of danger ringing.
I think the biggest reason why everyone
at the home stays upset with me, is you.
You manipulated everyone
to be against me.
They say the truth,
we should stay away
from the poor relatives.
Jealous people.
No matter how much you try,
but in this house,
I won’t leave you,
I’ll always be on your head
if you’re here.
Rania.
You’ll see.
Rania what happened, put it down,
come here, come.
Come Rania, what are you doing,
you’ve gone crazy.
