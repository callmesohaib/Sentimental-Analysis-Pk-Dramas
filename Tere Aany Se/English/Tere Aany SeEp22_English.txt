I don't know what is happening to me,
I keep thinking about this girl 24/7.
I have to admit
I have some distinguished
feelings for her.
When she is in front of me
I don't like anything else.
If she is out of my sight
there is nothing I want to see.
I didn't want this,
what is happening to me?
Although she does not even
fall to my standards, yet,
yet I don't know why.
Well she's really egoistic,
she won't ever agree.
But me,
I've made up my mind,
you'll be the one to approach me.
You'll have to give up,
that's how our love story
will move forward.
Uncle,
uncle.
Uncle, wake up, open your eyes.
How are you?
Fine,
don't need to worry.
If you're not getting better
by this doctor
then we should change the doctor.
No there is nothing like that,
I just have a fever,
it'll go away in a while.
Okay then I should call Rania here,
at least you'll be comforted.
No don't call Rania,
she will be worried for no reason.
Also, they're having a good time
at sister's house,
let her participate in it as well.
I'm just tired,
I got tired.
It happens when one gets tired,
we get a fever.
It'll be fine, nothing happened.
Okay, then I'll get lunch for you.
No.
I'm not going to listen to you.
I'm going to get you a meal
and you have to eat it.
I'm going to get it.
Mr. Dabeer you've disappeared
from here
like the horns from
the donkey's head.
The one I held captive for 20 years,
ran away.
Well,
I won't sit back,
Mr. Dabeer Ahmed Chaudhary,
I'll chase you till your grave.
Oh God,
seems like I'm getting really
sentimental thinking about all this.
No, no, no, no.
I won't chase anyone till grave
not Dabeer's nor mine.
What am I even thinking,
I'm crazy.
If he has pride in himself,
he isn't wrong for it.
Sister-in-law,
what's happening to father?
He was well, why does he get
so sick so often now?
Father had a lot of hopes
for this proposal,
the one you rejected.
To be honest he is tired
now my responsibility,
concern for you,
care about Rania.
He is all alone,
how long will he manage?
I think his strength is giving up.
Why are you scaring me?
I am not scaring you,
I am explaining to you.
Uncle is really worried about
your marriage, get married.
To be honest, your fate scared me.
Your deserted life became
a fear for me.
I don't want some cruel and
cold-hearted man to be a part of my life.
And also I heard,
a sister or a daughter has to bear
the consequences of a man's actions.
No Bebo,
uncle's nobility and piousness will
always protect you and Rania.
Don't let your heart be the victim
of these suspicions.
Move forward with your life,
get settled,
do you understand?
Oh, okay, this is the list for
Mona's engagement, okay, okay.
Yes, prepared it for you.
Rent for the venue,
meal for 500 people.
Fireworks, flower garlands,
watches as gifts, groom's gift.
400 kgs of sweets.
Groom's outfit, bridal dress,
bridal jewelry, giveaways for family.
10 drummers, rings for the bride and groom.
Sound system, money for gifts.
Oh God.
And oh, there is more, it isn't ending.
Dabeer, keep reading.
Sweets.
Flower petals, garlands,
drummers.
Decorators, chairs, children's clothes,
snacks, ice cream, money for charity.
Horse ride and what is this?
A monkey's play for the guests?
Oh fear the God, mother.
All of this won't be possible.
You're absolutely right uncle,
I agree with you.
How can't this be possible?
Did you forget what family
do you belong to?
What parent's and
ancestor's offspring you are?
Your grandfather had elephants
hanging from the door.
Elephants hanging?
Yes.
What a sight it must be,
elephants taking a swing.
Well the rope that was used must've been
imported from some genie's kingdom, right?
Rania, the amount of meals
they are preparing,
I think they've actually
invited genies and ghosts.
The girl who's getting married,
is my daughter-in-law
Seema's younger sister,
she's her biological sister, right?
And the Rafique Ahmed,
where she's getting married,
there are rivers of cash flowing there.
And that son of his, that.
That cricket sized.
Yes, yes, cricket-sized son.
He, since this proposal was finalized,
has been too arrogant.
I didn't like this relationship at all.
But Seema was impressed
by the money.
And that's how we got
all the responsibilities.
Thank God, that our Rabail is saved.
And that Mona, she's a wonder,
she'll recite an enchantment,
and that Khawar will turn into
her own flying monkey.
My child, leave the cricket and
flying monkey, talk about me.
Mother, look at this, I'm begging you
to please have mercy on me.
Forgive me for God's sake,
I can't make all of this happen.
If my Mahir had enough money,
my heart wouldn't be broken today.
On my one call,
he would give all his treasures,
and he'd spend money like this, like this.
Stop it mother, "spend like this".
I've asked this pale monkey
so many times, mother.
I've been sending him dollars all my life,
and I advised him,
to not spend it all, save them.
But him, you know
what this idiot did?
Bought some houses here,
rented them
and now he's living off of the rent.
If this idiot were smart,
we'd have 4-7 plazas in this city.
You're absolutely right uncle.
Now that you are back look at
the shopping of this strange prince,
he'd decorate his jacket with the moon
and the stars if he could.
What are you staring at?
I will tell the reality to my uncle.
Uncle, focus on his brought up,
doesn't perceive poor people
as human.
The poor have no respect or status
and front of him.
I don't know what he thinks of himself.
And, and, the idea of showing off
at the wedding it was also his,
innocent grandmother just
agrees with him.
Hey, what am I hearing?
Father, father, I don't know
what is she saying,
I am also hearing this
for the first time.
I am more surprised than you are,
don't you have manners?
Stop your nonsense,
you keep saying whatever comes
to your mind.
"I'm more surprised than you"
you don't have any wisdom, you donkey.
Hello? Yes, wife? How are you?
Dabeer, why don't you
answer my calls?
Return first,
then I'll let you know in a way
you won't forget.
Yes, yes, yes,
okay, okay.
Absolutely already, okay.
Is he talking to his wife or his boss?
So when is my crown returning?
Husband's audacity, I'll return
whenever you order me to.
Well sweetie,
I gave you a leave application
for 1 month.
I tore off that application right there.
And tell me honestly, how many dollars
did you take from here?
Money? No, no, no,
I didn't bring any money. Sweetie.
What is that witch saying?
Let me talk to her,
I will make her right, give it to me.
She isn't saying anything mother,
she is sending you greetings.
Yes, I told the mother that
you are sending your regards.
Sweetie, I fell off the stairs
while talking to you.
Hello? Hello?
I'll talk to you later.
Hello?
Oh, thank God.
Damn you.
What did I do?
Disgraced our whole family.
You are my son and
yet that coward?
Get lost, I'm so angry,
I'm going.
Mother, don't be so angry,
your blood pressure will go up.
Listen, listen to me calmly,
some situations demand
a certain thing.
Rania, Rania my child,
explain this to mother.
Yes, grandmother look.
Why would she explain,
she is the only smart person
in the house?
There are a lot of people in this house
who're smarter than her.
You are not one of them,
sit quietly,
you wooden monkey,
you keep speaking anything.
Look, mother, I am still telling you,
send the message to the groom's family
that we will have a simple engagement.
I am not going to waste my
hard-earned money by myself.
Whatever she does with you,
she is right.
Listen to me very clearly,
I will sell a house but
won't cut the expenses.
Oh mother listen to me.
What does that mean?
Mother stop.
Don't do this stupidity, don't sell the house,
I only have one property in my name.
Well, tell me honestly,
why did you call me here,
do you know how difficult
it was for me to get here?
Well actually,
I was thinking to meet you before
the engagement, I do have the right.
And I swear I fell and love with
you the first time I saw you.
Oh God, swear?
I swear on you.
Then why didn't you tell me?
You didn't have the guts to do that.
Don't talk about guts the world uses
the examples of my bravery.
Listen, come out,
it was just a tire burst.
So what were you saying?
My bravery.
Yes I witnessed.
You must've seen that day,
on the engagement I said no
at the last moment.
Because I was falling for you.
Well tell me honestly,
what do you think of me?
See, I can't speak the truth,
but yes
I'm not the one to live
in the Dreamland.
I never imagined my future husband
to be like a movie star,
I mean he should be,
but a blonde monkey.
But yes he should have a big house,
a shiny new car,
and nothing else in his wallet
except my picture and money.
Look, I'm blonde but not a monkey,
you'll see on the engagement day,
I'll get ready at the salon,
and I'll look so good your friends
will want to keep looking at me.
And that damned Rabail will regret.
What, what did you just say?
Look, listen to me.
If you have anything in your heart,
tell me already.
No, I only have you
in my lungs or hearts.
I could swear if you want.
No there is no need for that,
but can you do one thing for me?
I'll do two things.
I always wanted to receive a car
as a wedding gift from you.
Two, I'll gift you two cars.
The one I'll drive on my own.
I'll get scolded at home,
nothing else.
Listen? What do you keep mumbling?
Nothing, don't worry my darling.
Can I call you darling?
Yes, yes, why not darling?
Listen, that's enough talking,
now order something to eat.
Yes, yes, waiter.
Two of whatever you have cooked.
We'll have one here then one later.
Yes, have this in the car.
Brother you have given me a lot of hope
see we are an average household,
my son just started his job.
We can't be doing all these
excessive expenses.
Sister, what are you saying?
Have you looked at me? Do I look like
a nawab's son?
I am a really hard-working person,
I work really hard in America.
I have spent a very sad life there, mint.
Well, leave it, let it go.
So we've decided that we won't arrange
Rabail and Farhad's wedding
along with Mona and
Khawar's wedding.
We'll do it separately, according
to our budget, okay sister?
Thank you.
What pious thinking you have,
what great mindset you've got.
I don't know why I feel like forming
a relationship with your family.
I mean.
Ayaz.
No, no, uncle the matter is,
we're only two brothers,
a sister had died.
If I had a younger sister
I would have thought about you.
I am already impressed
with your family.
Uncle what do you do in America?
Yes uncle, what else,
I just do labor work for my children.
Brother, you're here alone,
you could've brought your wife along.
Yes, that, well sister,
it's better not to mention her.
She appears if you think about her.
You didn't understand?
It’s okay, let it be,
let's have the tea.
So we're done with the decision.
Sister-in-law.
Yes.
Look how beautiful Rani looks.
Really, with the grace of God.
It looks like she grew up in Lahore.
How easily she adjusted
to that environment.
You know Bebo, that's
the traits of brave girls,
they either adjust with the situation
or adjust the situation.
Father taught both of these to her.
That's true, our Rani is very smart
and brave.
Not like either of us.
Hey, what are you saying?
Rani has so many traits from you,
it seems like she is more like you
and her grandfather than me.
Exactly like her aunt and grandfather.
Thank God she is not like her father.
Sorry, sister-in-law.
I don't know how it slipped
through my tongue.
Sometimes the bitterness of the heart gets
to the tongue even if we stop it a thousand times.
It’s okay, bebo.
Forget what happened.
That time is long gone.
I was saying,
uncle's condition is a lot better now,
you can visit Lahore,
they're preparing for the wedding
so you can attend that as well.
You should come along, it will be
more fun if we're both together.
How can I go,
there are so many things to do here
who is going to do that?
Also my students will have exams soon,
they'll be in a loss.
And greater than anything,
uncle needs someone,
how can I leave him alone?
I can't go leaving him alone,
you should go
Rani will be happy to see you.
You have also done the preparations.
Where did the TV remote go?
Pass me the remote.
Why do you make such a beautiful face
when you look at me?
Hello?
Don't try to befriend me
for no reason.
What? What? What?
I, being frank with you,
believe in God, dude.
Listen,
who are you calling dude?
I don't like anyone being frank like this,
so talk to me with manners.
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.
Yes and I know very well,
why you keep making the same mistake.
Why?
Because you are finding excuses
to befriend me.
And now that you have lost me
you regret it.
Well you and Khawar a perfect pair,
both of you are extremely
delusional about yourselves.
You will suit each other,
best of luck.
And I know very well
who you dream of.
What do you mean?
Oh hello?
That fiancé of yours?
Your husband-to-be?
Richest, most beautiful Khawar,
go investigate after him.
Leave me alone.
Always after me,
spoiled my mood.
I’ve stopped pining
after you a long time ago,
now I am only after my Khawar.
And he’s after me.
Let me send him a picture of me.
Oh wow, I feel so much better.
I’ll sacrifice my life for my mother,
there is magic in my mother’s hands.
Oh mother,
I feel so relaxed.
The way you’ve massaged my head,
I feel like youth flowing
through me again.
Mother, I don’t want to go back.
Our country is our country.
I don’t want to return.
Then don’t return,
why are you going back,
call your wife here as well.
Oh that reminded me of,
how are her legs?
She has such long legs mother.
What do you mean?
Didn’t her leg fracture?
Is it healed? What did the doctor say?
It did fracture, her leg did fracture.
Then?
The doctor joint it back again,
it was really hard but it is healed.
And now she dances around the house.
I had a wish that my elder daughter-in-law,
the eldest daughter-in-law of this house should
do all the preparations under her supervision.
Oh mother, don’t even worry about that,
even from far away she has her eyes here.
She has updates on everything.
By the grace of God.
Look everyone has certain good qualities,
sweetie would have some too.
A lot of good qualities mother,
a lot of good qualities.
Uncle, here is your lassi.
Oh, live long, live long.
Thank you, my child, thank you.
Mother, what an aroma lassi
of my own country has.
Okay now tell me,
what do you want for dinner?
For dinner? Hold this.
Mother, I want fenugreek,
spinach with meat.
meat?
What a big deal.
I’ll get it made.
Get it prepared.
Really? You’ll prepare it?
Okay.
Another thing,
for the breakfast.
Mother.
Yes?
I want the potato flatbreads.
I’ll sacrifice for you.
Not a problem uncle, I will get them
made early in the morning.
You wake up early in the morning?
I wake up at dawn.
Live long, live long.
Mother, I really like this girl
for my Mahir.
Oh you said what was in my heart,
but what can I do?
Every sane person
in this world likes her
but your son on the other hand.
He lacks some sense,
he only sees imperfections
in this girl.
I don’t know what standards
he has said for his wife,
that my Rania does
not fall to his standards.
He will never approve of this.
Donkey’s offspring.
What?
I mean extremely dumb.
Yes.
It’s okay this way,
I’m not dying after that crazy cat,
I already don’t want to marry so soon.
Because I want to be a prime minister.
It is my bat, I will bat first.
No.
What no?
We’ll decide with the game.
There won’t be a game.
Uncle why are you always crying?
How much?
1000 rupees.
What? That’s too much.
No ma’am.
No, no, that’s too much,
tell me the right fare.
Madam petrol is getting expensive,
we have travelled a long distance.
I only have this.
No, no, give me 1000.
That’s a lot, this is all I got,
take this, go.
Go, go, go.
That’s the right address
but which house is it?
This one or that one?
Excuse me, excuse me,
can I help you?
Yes, do you know
which one is grandmother’s
I mean Azra Jahan begum’s house?
This one or that one?
Azra Jahan begum,
grandmother’s house.
I know,
I know, actually only one in the
whole neighborhood to know her house.
I remember now, it’s there,
should we go?
Do I look like someone without hands?
No.
Then why did you carry my luggage,
I can pick it up myself.
Actually don’t take it the wrong way,
I get this feeling of responsibility
as a man whenever I see a woman.
Actually my family’s customs,
traditions,
and teachings tell us that
whenever you see woman,
help her carry her things
and drop her home.
Should we go?
The woman looks attractive
but how do I find out
if she is for my type or married?
Ayaz, gather the strength,
gather the strength.
You’re probably a guest?
What kind of question is that?
I am a guest that’s why I am asking
for the address to the house.,
Does anyone ever ask for the address
of their own house from others?
No, I meant to say you are all
alone in this big city,
nobody accompanied you,
you’re alone, everything alright?
So you belong to the category of man
that cannot look at the girls
getting independent.
Girls?
You call yourself a girl,
I think you are unmarried, right?
So then?
Oh my God.
I can’t say anything now.
This is grandmother’s house,
it seems like you’re here for a while,
your bag seems heavy.
No, only for a few days.
I’ll work in a few days.
What?
They are such nice people,
very respectable.
I’ve met them, nice people.
You can adjust inside?
Here’s your bag.
Thank you.
Go, go.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, God.
You’re the last hope,
my only hope,
you’re the one to keep my respect,
my last hope.
Why did you shut my mouth?
I told you, you can’t do it,
I don’t want you to do it,
I wanted to go to some
expensive salon.
Have you gone mad?
Brother Dabeer will have a heart attack
if he hears that.
Haven’t you seen
how stingy he is?
He has been saying his dollars.
It’s okay if he does not give me money,
I don’t have anything to do
with his dollars.
If I ask My Darling Khawar,
he will get me anything.
Shut up, it’s about our honor,
what is he going to think about it,
we are that useless, we are poor,
we cannot afford it?
You don’t value your sister
am I sanding your face?
Sister you have already ruined
the faces of the girls back and village,
don’t do these experiments on me.
Shut your mouth,
it does not look good, the facial
won’t work if you don’t stay quiet.
You keep going on and on.
How did you come here?
How did you like my surprise?
I loved it.
Do you know Rani
how much I missed you?
Do you know
how much I missed you?
I’m so happy.
Mona.
Hi.
Bebo.
Bebo it wasn’t a surprise
it was a heart attack.
Hello.
Greetings.
Hello.
Asia my child,
Yes uncle?
ask bebo, did she reach or not?
Uncle Bebo called,
she has reached safely.
And our Rani is also very happy
to see her.
It proved to be a really good surprise.
Okay, thank God.
It must be the tuition students,
I’ll beat them today,
I told them to get here on time and
they always come before the time.
Aren’t you going to invite me in?
Asia.
Do you remember my name?
Thank you.
I thought you must’ve forgotten it.
I’m really ashamed Asia.
I’m here to apologize.
For what?
Asia my child, who’s there?
Father,
my father.
Father,
father.
Who are you,
I couldn’t recognize.
Father,
what are you saying, father.
Father, I’m Zaman,
your Zaman.
Father, I made a great mistake,
forgive me, father.
It was a really big mistake, father.
I still regret it.
Please forgive me.
You’re among big people,
with a lot of money.
Why are you apologizing
to a small man like me?
You’re embarrassing me,
we...
We don’t have anything to give you.
Go,
go back to your world.
Father,
father, I came here with a lot of hope,
please forgive me.
I’m really hopeless,
really lonely.
Father at least ask what happened to me
in all those years.
Did you ever think,
you left a young girl
and an infant daughter
what happened to them?
That, in your life,
she’s been living like your widow.
Your daughter thinks you are dead.
And you really are dead for us,
dead do not return.
We don’t have any space
for you in our lives.
Father I made a mistake,
a really big mistake,
please forgive me.
We bore the consequences
of your mistake.
You rejected my child
she bore the pain for that.
We don’t have any place
for you in our hearts.
Father,
father for God’s sake.
Don’t test my patience.
Go away.
Asia,
for God’s sake listen to me.
The gate is open.
