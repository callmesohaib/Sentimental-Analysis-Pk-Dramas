How are you?
You finally miss home?
I don’t miss home,
but yes, I missed you and wanted to come here.
I have heard someone was going
to take out a missing campaign for me.
Someone was really worried for me,
they wanted to call me home, huh?
Stop smiling and you don’t need to get so happy.
Yes, but mama got ready sad
by that action of yours.
By the way, leaving the battle field
and running away is not bravery.
Then what else could I do, Rania?
Fight with my dad?
My step mother?
No man,
I have not been brought up like that.
So now, what will you do now?
You don’t have the temperament to do a job,
and then you don’t find a job so easily nowadays.
And how long will you stay at your friend’s home?
He will excuse himself one day.
Who told you that I will stay at my friend’s home?
Hey, we have really rich relatives.
I have an uncle, he is really rich,
servant, bank balance, cars, he has everything.
I will live with him.
What was the uncle’s name?
Uncle Zaman. Yes.
I am not joking, I am serious.
So when am I joking? See, I am serious.
I have one relationship with uncle Zaman,
now if this second one gets formed,
I will be in for a treat.
I will come back.
He is dying more than
me for my father’s wealth.
Oh God.
This world is all about money.
If you have it, you are in trouble,
if you don’t, you are in trouble.
This is the limit.
Honey tell me, will you come
or should I come get you.
I need your help so much,
but you are not coming.
When did I say no?
I am coming to Pakistan.
But as soon as I land,
first I will go to my uncle’s home.
That uncle, whose face you
have not seen for so long.
Honey, why are you making
my blood pressure rise so much?
Aunty, I have a blood relation with him.
We often talk on call.
Now mama passed away,
that doesn’t mean that our relation is over.
I will stay there for two to four days,
then I will come to you.
You are really stubborn,
if you get stuck on something, you don’t agree.
Rania. Rania, wait.
Okay bye.
Okay, I was asking, should I drop you?
I told you there is no need for that,
the van must be on its way.
Man, I agree that I have a small ride,
it is what the poor drive,
but I can drop you. Come on
Don’t talk this nonsense with me.
For me a man and humanity are
worth more than money and wealth.
And I have nothing to do with the elder papa,
nor do I have anything to do with his wealth,
so in future don’t talk about this nonsense.
Yes, but that is the reality Rania.
The wheel of time spun in such a way
that now you are rich and I am poor.
The same thing again.
If you are so worried about the wheel of time,
then do something yourself.
Don’t take favours from anyone.
Just like I don’t.
I have decided to work hard, Rania.
And I have decided I will do something myself.
For the first time in my life,
I heard something smart from you.
Hmmm..
smile and talk to her.
But madam Sweetie has decided you
wont get anything in your hands.
Neither my dollars, nor Mahir.
Because you threw a brick at me,
now I will throw a stone at you.
My van must be there.
You made me get late.
Hey, I will drop you.
Hello.
Did you have breakfast?
I will.
Okay come on,
today I will make breakfast for you.
There is no need for that.
Aunt is inside, I will ask her,
she will make flat bread for me.
Thank you.
Okay listen,
do you want to go to America?
I can take you along.
It is a simple thing for me.
I have no interest in going to America
or some other country.
This is Pakistan, my birth place.
I won’t leave it and go anywhere. No.
There are other people who leave their country
and go live in the country of others
as second class citizens, but not me.
So thank you and sorry.
Where are Mona and Rabail?
Call them.
They are working in the kitchen.
Oh okay. Fine.
Mama, I want to talk to you about
something really important.
Yes, go ahead.
What do you want to talk about?
Now?
Yes.
The thing is that Khaver has told Mona that
brother Rafiq is coming with his
family to get the wedding date.
But I have lost my sleep after
what he said after that.
That boy Khaver, that innocent, naive,
simple boy, he has completely changed.
He cannot keep his feet on the ground,
he is flying high.
He has told Mona that I will have really
rich friends that will come to the marriage,
so the dowry should be grand.
Don’t embarrass me.
Tell him, not to embarrass us,
come with your face covered.
We too will have relatives comes over.
People from the community will come. Yes?
Mama, so I was saying, I don’t understand
from where we will arrange the dowry.
Uncle Salim has a government job,
even he cannot arrange it.
His sisters have been
upset since the engagement.
I don’t understand what we should do.
This has a simple solution,
break the wedding.
So why do you worry?
I have taken the responsibility of
Mona’s wedding, and I will fulfill it.
You will see, I will make the dowry,
it will be worth more than Khaver.
What is your problem?
God have given me enough that
I will not take a favour from you.
You don’t worry Seema,
I will live up to my promise.
Oh mama,
you are great.
You have removed all my worry.
May your shadow always
be on our heads. Ameen.
Ameen.
Greetings.
Greetings. You are here?
You should have gone inside.
No, there is no need for that.
You didn’t visit the hospital for so long,
nor did you come home.
Are You upset with me as well?
No, I am not upset with anyone.
Don’t lie.
My poor papa is worried.
He is really worried.
In fact, you come with me,
I will show you. Come on.
No.
I cannot go to your home now.
Rania, please don’t do that.
And won’t you listen to me, either?
Don’t punish papa so badly
for that mistake of his?
Is that mistake worth forgiving?
Is this mistake only a small mistake?
For me this was injustice,
it was extreme cruelty,
and my mother, me, mian jee
and bebo have suffered for it.
You go and tell him that you he goes back to
them for whose sake he broke all relations.
Because now we have learned to live without him.
But he finds this life incomplete without you.
He is waiting for you.
But why?
I will never go to him now.
Never.
What a useless film. It is so useless.
You are scared for no reason.
There are no ghosts.
You will see once again, nothing will happen.
The same thing has been happening
for an hour, no ghosts are showing up.
This means fate is on my side.
Rania is busy watching a movie.
No. No.
Sweetie.
Sweetie. Sweetie.
Hey, Sweetie, what are you doing here?
Brother Rafiq is going to come.
This is the limit. Be quick. Come outside.
Nabeel, we have been robbed.
We have been robbed.
Huh? What are you saying Sweetie?
yes, Nabeel, I had kept thousand dollars
and my diamond ring in my purse myself,
it is not there, it has disappeared,
it has been stolen.
Okay, calm down. Calm down.
You search carefully,
the things must be there.
We have never had things
stolen from our home.
I have looked everywhere carefully.
I know it has been stolen.
Sweetie,
come I will help search with you.
Come on. Come.
I know we will not find anything from anywhere,
and I know who stole it, I will never forgive them.
Hey, talk slowly madam Sweetie.
What are you saying?
We cannot put a blame on
anyone for theft in this home.
If the robbery happened here in this home,
so I will put the blame on
the people living in this home.
You can sit quietly over here.
I am not that bad grandma,
that I enjoy on the wealth
of my rich father all my life.
Yes, son.
Hey not rich father,
the dollars of the stepmother.
Sister talks so much about dollars,
I am thinking I will take my salary in dollars too.
You know it is not a bad idea, Shahanshah.
Right?
Oh. Oh. I got ruined, I got robbed.
Oh my Nabeel, I had told him
so many times not to eat these Nihari,
trotters, brain, curry,
he never listened to me.
Go check on him, what happened?
Take him to the hospital.
Sister in law, wear bangles right now
and break them on the table.
What are you two staring at?
Go, go and take him to the hospital.
There is a possibility
that there is some home.
I…I will take him.
Mahir, Mahir, call the ambulance.
I will call the ambulance.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Dad. Hey, dad is here.
What happened? How are you?
Brother, does anyone walk
around like this after a heart attack?
You have shown me stars in the day.
What happened? What happened?
I am fine. Move back.
I am fine, right in front of you.
What attack are you people talking about?
Hey your dad has thick skin,
I got robbed, I got ruined.
All my dollars and diamond ring got stolen.
Hey, you created such a scene that
something happened to my Nabeel.
All of you note that
she will make me have a heart attack.
Mama, you don’t need to
worry so much for Nabeel.
Anyway, this is a long debate, right now I need
my thief who stole everything and ran away.
What are you saying?
How would we know? Huh?
And thousands of people get robbed on the streets,
who told you to keep a diamond
ring in your purse and also dollars.
Madam, the robbery happened in
this home and I know who the robber is.
Hey, then what the need to worry?
If you know then catch them.
Here, I caught you.
What are you doing? We don’t joke around?
Yes. But we hate each other.
I know from the start you hate me.
Hey if you needed money,
then you should have told me,
I would have given it in charity.
But you thought stealing was right.
You must be in the habit to steal
money since childhood.
Aunt Sweetie,
do you have any idea of how big of
an allegation you are putting on Rania?
What need does she have to steal your dollars?
Leave her hand. Leave it. You move.
Hey, she needed it the most.
She is the one who used to talk about doing a job.
She needed money the most.
Hey, be quiet.
Or else I will forget that you are
the elder daughter in law of this home.
You can do whatever you want,
but I will search her room.
Nobody dare to do this.
No Mahir, why do you get angry?
All of us know that Rania didn’t do
anything, then why are we scared?
Let sister in law Sweetie search.
Her heart will be satisfied.
And what if you don’t find your
dollars in Rania’s room, then?
Will you apologize to her in front of everyone.
Fine, I give everyone my word,
I will search her room and
if I don’t find anything in her room,
then I will hold my ears and beg
forgiveness from this girl.
But I have to search her room.
Enough?
Are you satisfied?
Are you happy?
Look at this, for God’s sake, stop this drama.
See how the poor thing is in
a bad shape, ask for forgiveness.
One minute.
She is still not satisfied.
What sort of a woman is she?
See. My doubt was correct.
This.
How did this get here?
I don’t know. I don’t know, mama.
Yes, you don’t know.
How would you know, huh?
I didn’t do anything.
Yes, you are really innocent.
The dollars started walking that
they came walking in your room.
And then they hid in your pillow.
Mama, I never even went in her room.
How will I get it?
I know you be quiet child.
I didn’t do it.
I know, you didn’t do it. She is a liar.
Aunt Sweetie kept this herself.
Oh God.
Oh God. Oh God.
You are blaming me.
I never saw your room, why would I do that?
Mama, last night aunt Sweetie…
Be quiet.
Nabeel, this girl is a thief,
I cannot tolerate a thief in my home.
I am dragging her out of this home.
You get out. Hey, you thief.
Hey, how are you dragging her out like this?
Hey Sweetie, have you gone mad?
Hey, wait. Stop. Hey.
What is going on here?
I ask, what is happening here?
If anyone looks at my daughter with
a dirty eye, they will see the worst in me.
Now why are you all stand quietly?
Will someone tell me what is happening?
Zaman,
she has gone mad in her arrogance of wealth.
She has lost it.
But the allegation she put on
our daughter, we have all rejected it.
We know our daughter cannot
do something so cheap.
Brother Zaman,
Rania child, see,
I am begging you for forgiveness.
Finger has been pointed at you at this home,
a baseless allegation has been put on you.
I am apologizing on everyone’s behalf, forgive is.
If you were so brave,
you should have attacked me face to face.
Why did you attack me like a coward like this?
You should have shown some courage.
A coward for an enemy is worse
than a brave enemy, aunt Sweetie.
And the allegation you have
put it is not just on Rania,
it is on the respect of our family,
and we wont forget it ever.
We will always remember it.
Oh, this is the same example that
the robber is scolding the one who caught them.
All of you know that this girl is wrong,
but she your relative so you
find her right, and I, who is right,
I am wrong because I am an outsider
and no one sympathizes with me.
Shut up. Shut up.
Don’t you dare say a word to this girl,
I will cut your tongue.
Control yourself Mr. Nabeel.
How can you say this to me in my home?
I will make one call to the embassy,
they will come here,
and they will send you and also your
family to the jail. Do you understand?
Come on, Rania, child.
Come with me.
From today, you will live with me.
I will tell this woman
that I can buy thousand such
homes for my daughter, come on.
No. No. Uncle Zaman,
please you don’t take Rania anywhere.
I am sorry son,
but if Rania herself tells me she wants to live here,
still I won’t let her live here.
She is not an orphan
or oppressed girl that whoever
wants blames her when they want.
Her father is alive and
she will live with her father.
And if someone has the courage
then they should try to stop me.
Come on, child.
Such a low life woman trampled
the respect of my family under her feet.
She blamed an innocent girl of theft.
Mama, don’t call it a blame.
I don’t know why all of you
are ready to ignore this fact.
Leave us. Leave us alone and go.
Go away to where you came from.
It is weird. All of you sympathize with her.
You people are behaving
like I went to Rania’s room myself
and kept the dollars that go child,
have fun. It is weird.
Papa, last night…
Stop it Tipu. Stop it right now.
Go to your room my son. Go my son, go.
Don’t worry, everything will be fine.
How will it be fine?
Shall we go?
What is the matter?
Please child. Please, stop crying.
Now only weak people cry,
and what are you worried about?
Your father is standing with you.
Now do you understand
how I must have lived
my life without my father.
How Mian Jee took care of his
old age and weakness, just for me.
To become my shadow,
how he must have burned in the sun.
Child, forgive me.
Today she put such a big allegation
on me considering me alone.
She made me fall in everyone’s eyes.
Right now everyone is calling me innocent.
But once at one time they
will think that maybe I did this.
I did this cheap thing for some need.
I cannot face anyone right now.
Never.
Never.
You promise me,
you wont say anything to Dr. Wasti.
You wont tell him anything.
What respect will I have left?
Why do you worry so much?
Please don’t think so much.
See, no one was thinking like that about you,
nor will anyone think this way.
Everyone was standing with you.
Don’t burden your mind
so much for no reason.
Now come on.
Come.
Come on.
The question is,
why was the doubt on Rania?
The people of this home are in
an even worse situation than Rania.
Have you seen uncle Hamad,
he is jobless, the expenses of his children.
And aunt?
Aunt is always sad about the fact that
why she is not as rich as aunt Sweetie?
Why can she not wear
such expensive clothes.
And me?
All my expenses are taken care of uncle Dabeer.
Then why didn’t she doubt all of us?
Why did she search Rania’s room first?
Because she wanted to
insult Rania in front of everyone.
She wanted to insult Rania in front of everyone
and drag her out of this home.
Because obviously, it was Rania who didn’t listen
to her, she used to argue with her.
Okay,
so all this has done through
a well thought out plan.
Rania has been sent out of this
home through a conspiracy. Grandma.
Mahir,
take out the car and take me to Rania.
Don’t ask me any questions,
just take out the car.
Hey, how do I take it out grandma?
Your beloved daughter in law
has the keys to the car as well.
I will not ask her for the keys.
Then get a taxi and take me.
Fine, I will get a cab.
I will also come along.
Okay.
Who am I?
The eldest daughter in law of this home,
on whom the responsibility of taking care of this
entire family has been put and my respect?
Hey you have no respect.
The one who makes their respect is respected.
You have made my head bow down with shame.
Everyone trusts that stranger girl so much,
and no one cares for the one
who has faced so much loss.
Hey, to hell with your loss.
What did Rania do to you that
you have become her enemy?
Hey, now I understand,
you want to drag everyone
out of this home one by one.
Because you want to take over our home.
Your home? Do you have no shame?
How are you calling this your home?
This home is mine.
I had a small wish that my name
plate is put outside this home, but now?
Now it has become my desire.
You know well, Sweetie makes the thing
that she gets after her own.
What are you saying, man?
Meaning aunty Sweetie put
a blame of theft on Rania?
How can she do that?
Sister Rania was crying a lot as well.
Didn’t her family say anything?
Everyone was saying that
sister Rania cannot do this,
but this aunt sweetie is really cunning.
She must have kept
the dollars in aunt Rania’s room,
that is why she went to her room at night.
One second.
Aunt went in Rania’s room?
But when?
And how do you know this?
I saw her myself,
I got up to drink water at night.
One second.
Come here, tell me everything in detail.
What happened at night?
Oh,
okay listen to me.
Did you tell everyone this?
I was telling everyone,
but no one was listening to me.
They were all saying that you be quiet.
Come on.
Come home with me, I will also see
how your family doesn’t agree. Come on.
Zaman son,
I am really embarrassed
that in my own home,
while I was alive,
someone puts a cheap allegation on my Rania.
Oh I am saying that how will I face
my brother and my daughter Rania,
and how will I live
with this embarrassment?
Aunt, why are you blaming yourself?
You have no fault in this.
Child, Rania must not want
to see anyone of our faces.
You request her that
Rania doesn’t look away from us,
and she is not misled
about us in her heart.
No aunt, no,
she is not misled about anyone of you.
The poor thing fears that you people too
listen to Sweetie and don’t blame her.
Hey, no, no nothing like that uncle.
We also know Rania and we are also
witness of Mrs Nabeel’s behaviour.
None of us can think wrong about Rania.
Thank you,
but you can understand that
this is such a cheap allegation.
My daughter’s soul has been hurt from the inside,
she is unable to forget this moment.
Well done. Listen,
all that you have told us,
you have to go there and tell there as it is.
Come on. Come.
I am also coming along, and we have to
come back and embarrass that Sweetie.
Hey, where will you go?
I am going to tell mama all
the details, I will tell her.
No Hammad, this is a really important
moment, it is necessary that I go.
I don’t understand one thing,
those who had died for so long,
how did they come to life in such a filmy way.
Hey, I don’t understand this.
How did he come suddenly?
Hamad, did you see properly,
was he really Rania’s father?
He was brother Zaman,
I saw him clearly.
But he didn’t die, so don’t say anything
stupid when you go there, okay?
Okay, we are going son.
Come on. Come on.
Who cares about living people?
Come on. Come on.
Rania, how did you even think
that I would trust Mrs. Dabeer,
I mean, I will trust her and doubt you?
Never.
I trust you.
I was standing with you tomorrow
and I am standing with you even today.
You trust me so much?
More than myself.
Yes, if I talk about myself,
I can be selfish and do this,
but my Rania can never do that.
Grandma and Rabail are
waiting for you, they are worried.
They have to meet you.
Mama is here?
Why did you not tell me earlier?
Now I have told you. Come on.
Rania is innocent,
we were sure of that,
but now that we have proof,
I will go throw it in Sweetie’s face.
She put such a cheap allegation on my daughter,
I will never forgive her.
She has insulted me and my family.
Greetings.
Greetings. Come. Come.
Hey, my daughter.
Have a seat, mama.
Your mama will stand till you forgive her.
In my own home, in my presence,
that woman put a cheap allegation on you.
I cannot face myself, I am so badly shocked.
Yes,
you trust me right.
That is enough for me?
You please sit. Sit.
Rania child, nature has supported you.
We even have a witness for you.
That is why we came after mama.
The day aunt Sweetie kept dollars in your room,
Tipu saw her with her own eyes.
What?
Tipu saw her,
then why didn’t you speak up, idiot?
Brother Mahir, I was speaking up,
then but no one listened to me.
Because I am a child.
Rania child, you come home now.
Aunt, her father is still alive,
and in my presence
I cannot separate her from me.
Mama, I will come.
I will surely come and I will also get all
the preparations for Mona’s marriage done.
Don’t worry.
You people are my own.
Well done my princess.
My brave daughter.
I know you were never
afraid of anyone earlier,
and don’t be afraid of
anyone in the future either. Okay?
This Sweetie is just dirt in the way,
don’t worry about her. Okay?
Understand what I am saying.
Thank God this matter is sorted.
Now lets come to the other story.
I am restless to hear it for so long.
God be kind, what happened?
Rania’s papa, where did he come from?
I mean, where did he suddenly…
tell us, we have a right too.
I…
Tell her or she will keep on
going in circles in her restlessness.
Yes.
Okay, I will tell them.
Where did everyone go?
They have gone to
aunt Rania’s father’s home.
They can go to hell. Who cares?
Sweetie, don’t spoil your mood.
I want to praise you.
You have such a great mind.
Since I have heard about it,
I am shaken to the core.
I mean, you put an allegation
of theft on the cunning Rania.
Such a conspiracy sister,
I am your fan, I swear.
I didn’t setup a conspiracy,
there has really been a theft.
Sister, what is there to hide from us?
We are servants of the home,
we find out everything.
Sister, I swear I too am cunning like you.
I would say make me your student,
I will come for tuition to you.
I want to be as cunning as you.
If I was cunning, then all these people
wouldn’t have been living in my home like this
and they wont be spending my dollars.
I mean, they are living in my home
and they are showing attitude to me.
Am I..am I…what do they call it?
Low life?
Yes, yes, That. No.
Why would I be a low life?
Look this home is mine,
the car parked outside is also mine.
The super stores in America are also mine.
Low life is someone
who lives on someone else’s money.
Anyway, I have also thought
that first I will get all these
things in my name
and then once I take
Dabeer to America with me,
I will not let him come back.
In fact, now I have decided that
I will get what I want with interest.
Meaning?
Now should I tell you everything?
