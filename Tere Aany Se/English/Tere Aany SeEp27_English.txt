Listen, it's good that I found you here,
can you drop me at Saman's house?
Khawar and I are going for shopping.
If you are going with Khawar
ask him to pick up and drop you.
Why would I do that?
Do I run a cab service?
Oh, calm down,
why are you getting so angry?
You won’t be wasted if you drop me,
you're sitting idle
and Khawar is always busy with his work,
his business.
What keeps him busy?
Which office are you talking about?
He just stays there,
brother Arbab and uncle Rafique
do all the work.
And even if he is busy,
what do I do about it,
am I an employee?
If you really want to go,
get a cab and leave.
Hey, behave yourself,
do you know who I am?
The only future wife of a business man.
And I? Travel in a taxi?
Never.
Mona,
Mona.
I've heard Khawar has invited you
to shop and dinner?
It's true.
But he isn't dropping me there
and I'm getting late.
Let him go and listen to me,
I was the one who did all the hard work
to make this relationship possible.
And both you and Khawar
excluded me so conveniently.
So that's why I have decided,
you won't be going alone today,
I will go with you for shopping and
then we'll have dinner together.
I'd say Mahir,
you should join us as well,
especially since sister-in-law Sweetie
has disregarded you so much,
it's okay that you can't
afford expensive shoes,
phone, and clothes anymore.
It's all about time,
how we used to long for things,
but it's okay, come, join us.
We're getting late.
I'll don’t care about money.
And I'm not in such bad times
that I'll have to enjoy his money.
Okay, you stay at home,
and damn it,
we're getting late,
come on Mona.
Us? Not us, only me.
I, alone would be going for shopping and
dinner because he invited me only, not you.
Also it's your turn to
wash the dishes today,
and anyway if you aren't dropping me
then I can take lifts as well,
okay bye.
I could have asked Hammad.
How she's taunting me,
father's wife,
I have to do something for her.
I have to include Rania as well,
I'll tolerate her bitterness as well
but I can't tolerate
this madam Sweetie.
Only Rania can fight her
because poison kills poison.
It is a big mistake,
if I were in place of his daughter,
would I be able to forgive
such a father?
Yes, I might have forgiven him.
I would have forgotten everything
if I had my father in front of me,
and would run to hug him.
I should meet his daughter
and other family members,
I understand that
his fault is major
but I'll talk to them about him.
You are sitting here alone?
All good?
It feels nice.
Well, my father's second wife,
isn't she weird?
What do you mean?
Don't you think she's weird?
She changed suddenly,
she says she can see her mother
in our grandmother.
Can you believe it?
Rania, I think she's planning
for something big.
I don't know where do
uncle's family live.
And did you see?
She made grandmother her fan,
grandmother was talking strangely
at the dinner table.
I think she's planning a big game,
right?
I am thinking
I should consult aunt.
Why, what is the need
to consult aunt?
Everything is very obviously visible.
Who?
What are you talking about?
I said something,
did you hear anything?
Where are you lost?
I'm thinking about Dr. Wasiq...
Dr. Wasiq.
Now I understand,
that's why you are here,
alone at night,
lost in your thoughts.
He might have said something.
What did he say?
I should also know.
Not everything is to share.
Also,
I think you won't understand
the depth of this matter.
You're right,
only you or a qualified doctor like Dr. Wasiq
can understand the depth of this situation.
I might drown if I try to understand it.
It's something like this.
Okay, I'm sorry, it was my fault,
I thought you're alone so I should
give her some company,
sorry.
Stay alone.
If I didn't know your reality,
I would have fallen into your traps.
Why did you want to give me company,
I know it all too well.
Wasiq, Wasiq, Wasiq,
she's only saying his name.
If I could I would remove the name of
Dr. Wasiq from her heart and her mind forever.
Mahir, she's an independent citizen
of an independent country,
you can't restrict her.
I was the one who got you into
a relationship with Ifrah,
and how I think
I shouldn't have done that.
Rania played the main role
in that as well.
Whose friend are you? Mine or...
Hey, Rania, come here,
I have to scold you.
Salik.
Don't say something stupid,
she'll overreact.
How are you?
How is life?
What do I tell you,
life is very sad.
Who made my brother sad?
Must be Ifrah's family.
The issues of everyone around
the world matters to her but mine?
She takes it as a joke.
Can you see that?
Which problem?
That American mother issue?
I believe she's sent
to break your arrogance,
it's a role of nature,
you shall reap what you sow.
Did you see Salik?
She has such a negative
approach regarding me.
Rania, don't play with his soft
and delicate emotions.
Soft and delicate emotions?
And his?
May God forgive us.
Yes, that Dr. Wasiq has soft and
delicate emotions, not me.
Again Dr. Wasiq?
If your evil stepmother is being
cruel to you
so what does Dr. Wasiq
have to do with this?
Neither did Dr. Wasiq call his mother here
nor he's paying her to be cruel to him.
I don't know why you're after him.
And listen,
whatever she's doing
it’s her own ideas.
Okay now don't make a sad face,
I'll help you for God's sake.
Rania please, it'll be a favor.
He's buying a bike.
Bike? What do you mean?
Where is that, Hayabusa?
That bike?
Our hero gifted it to Mr. Malik
at his wedding long ago.
What?
Just for show-off?
Make fun of me,
as much as you want,
that's exactly what happens at the end,
she makes fun of all my issues.
Okay, I won't make fun.
Let's do one thing, Pickup, my scooty,
it's parked in Khushalpur,
import it and ride it for a while.
You'll remember it.
What? That scooty?
I'll ride?
And anyway I don't take
financial help from girls.
This, this is his narrow mindset.
Now ask me for help.
It's very good, whatever is happening
to you it’s well deserved.
I'll ask you when a woman will be
the prime minister of this country.
Which woman? We can't see a strong,
political woman currently.
I'm talking about the future
Mr. Salik, future.
Me, Rania Ahmed,
future prime minister.
Well Salik, that's an advantage
of talking to her,
come let's chant.
Prime minister, Rania Ahmed.
Long live, prime minister.
Long live, prime minister.
I want to slap them.
Don't discuss your big dreams
in front of narrow-minded people.
How do we our leader to be?
Like Rania Ahmed.
It's a compulsion, Rania Ahmed is needed.
Say it loud, Rania Ahmed.
Shout it, Rania Ahmed.
Say it slow, Rania Ahmed.
Say it loud, Rania Ahmed.
What are you doing?
Now say what?
I'm thinking to take Rabail
to a jeweller in a few days,
to get the jewellery of her choice.
You're thinking right,
I'll also meet her this way,
I mean I can give suggestions.
I'm getting your tricks, come,
you'll remember.
Well mother, it's just about suggestions,
I can give it too,
I can come along.
Hey, hey, hey, what kind of sister
you are, my enemy.
You have exams go and study.
I wish my fate was like that too,
I too, could take someone
to buy her jewelry.
But I'm unlucky,
moonlight for 4 days then
the same dark night.
Look at the jewelry.
Uncle? Why are you sitting here?
I'm getting vitamin D
in this scorching heat.
You look sad.
I'd be sad.
Everyone is setting
my dreams on fire.
4 years younger, 3 ¾ years
younger nephew is getting married.
They're doing preparations.
Tents are being arranged.
And I, am I going
to babysit his child?
Am I going to play with his children
and change their diapers?
What am I going to do?
My that, what do we call that?
Headdress, headdress, headdress.
When will the flowers for my headdress bloom?
When will the flowers bloom?
When will they carry my palanquin?
What? Palanquin is carried for girls,
boys take the barat.
Barat?
Yes.
Then when will my barat go?
And from where?
When will I get ready,
wearing a groom's headdress?
When will they do the videography
for my wedding?
When will they hide my shoes
or give me milk as a custom?
When will I wear a headdress
and take a, what is it?
Handkerchief like this?
When will the girls dance
at my ceremonies?
When? When will
all this happen? When?
Well it's saddening,
such a big social worker lives
next door, runs after you.
And you're getting so hopeless?
Now give,
give me your phone.
Phone?
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Phone.
I'm giving you aunt's contact number.
Aunt's contact is.
It is already saved,
then you should call,
you spend a good time,
you will be occupied.
I could call on
but I am afraid what if
your grandfather answers the call,
I heard he's in contact with
village's goons.
He's running a proper network,
what if they break my legs.
Oh, no, no, nothing like this
is going to happen,
instead it's a good thing
it will make your way.
And stop being coward,
be a lion, lion.
Call her, just like that,
let me get scotch tape from the house,
I have to wrap Tipu's book.
You be a lion.
Lion.
How many times I have told these ill-mannered
children to not play in front of the house,
they don't understand,
I will tell them now, today
I will break their legs.
This son of a Romeo
is calling again.
How many times have I told him
that I do not want to marry him.
He doesn't understand,
I'll correct his brain now.
How dare you call me,
I told you won't marry you,
is there grass in your head
instead of a brain?
That you don't understand it?
Ill-mannered,
fraud, boomer.
What do you mean?
That day you answered
with a smile,
so what do I think of it?
Who?
Are you Ayaz?
Yes, yes,
I'm that ill-mannered,
misbehaving,
and a little overage Ayaz.
I am sorry,
I didn't mean to say all that to you.
A crazy person here is after me,
he's annoying me I thought it was his call.
Very sorry, very sorry.
Okay leave this, tell me,
how are you?
I'm awake,
I mean I came alive Asma,
your sweet words gave life
to this dead.
Oh God, you talk so sweet.
Really?
Really.
Asma,
Asma.
The places we leave behind in the
journey of life, don't come back again.
Don't come back again.
Asma when you laugh,
it feels like spring is taking over.
Here you go,
an additional of a good deed
in my list of actions.
I connected two hearts,
well both of them were close
to their expiry date, well saved.
Thank you, God.
It feels like a storm.
You seem so happy,
where are you coming from?
Where are you coming from?
Where are you going?
Even my grandfather did not ask
so many questions.
I wish he did, would've saved us.
I am not in the mood to argue
because I am actually very happy,
do you know I almost finalized the
relationship between Uncle Ayaz and Bebo.
What?
You already fixed the relationship
between uncle Ayaz and Bebo?
Yes, what's so surprising in it?
The world accepts my wisdom.
Both liked each other
I got the hint and then what,
the love story started.
I think along with Rabail,
my aunt will also be getting married,
do your preparations and
don't say I didn't tell.
She recognizes everyone's love
but mine,
can't you see that?
Very strange wisdom you have.
Well-done Mr. Mahir,
you had to stick
to this crazy woman?
What can we do?
Now that we're stuck,
we have to make a sacrifice.
26, 26, hey my game. Hey.
Here, give me your thumbprint.
Game. You dare take this phone
from me again.
Hey listen to me,
listen to me,
don't suspect me, I know
that I'm really beautiful
but that doesn't mean,
you will stay in your suspensions.
Listen to me,
it's about 15-20 years old occurrence
when you use to look good.
When you get time from
playing the game
then look in the mirror for once,
you'll be scared.
You know I am very sensitive,
think before you say anything to me
that my heart can break.
Hammad, I'll listen to your
emotional stories later,
I'm very surprised,
not even surprised I'm worried.
Really? Tell me,
what happened?
Your sister-in-law.
What happened?
She's not a human.
What are you saying?
She's a riddle,
which I'm unable to solve.
She impressed mother-in-law,
she was admiring her.
Well you are right.
As soon as we get out of here,
it's better for us.
Hand me the phone.
Hello, hello,
hello, hello.
I'm really tired by going everywhere.
Khawar took me to so many places,
so many places, that I can't tell.
Then don't tell, who is asking?
Can't you see
a husband and a wife are having
an important discussion?
And listen to me, the way
you are roaming around with Khawar,
and shopping and dining, stop this,
it's not a part of our culture.
Really?
So now the elder sisters getting jealous
of her younger sister.
And why do I stop all this?
Did you forget your time,
where was it in your culture,
when you used to roam around with
brother Hammad on his bike secretly.
Now that the younger sister is going out
in a bigger car you are getting jealous.
Oh I'll die, Hammad did you see,
I got a taunt on your bike.
And listen to me,
your "Khawar weds Mona"?
I made this relationship happen,
if you misbehave with me like this
then I'll stop it.
Really? If that is what it is like,
then try it and if you succeed,
change my name.
Brother Hammad, Khawar is lovely,
and you know?
He's already miserable after me,
miserable.
My child, not miserable,
he's mad, he's crazy after you.
No it's not like that,
he really loves me
and do you know what he was saying?
He said Mona darling,
you're really beautiful
and modern,
and there is no one as innocent
and naive as you.
Innocent and naive our Mona.
I think I am really tired
and I also have to put these away,
okay bye.
Well what was I saying?
You were saying today onwards,
you will never repeat the mistakes
of your past,
you will respect me and
you won't snatch my phone for me.
When did I say that?
I will cut off your thumb
if you annoy me.
Here.
Thank you.
I became a maid here,
what are you asking me to do?
I have to include at least someone
in this act of mine.
Seema?
No, she's very.
Mona?
Madam Sweetie, for you,
Shehenshah's special strong tea
with extra sugar.
Shehenshah, you can go now,
when I am done
with making the breakfast
then you can come to set the table.
Okay, go now.
Okay.
What are you doing early
in the morning?
Oh, today was my day off
from the university
so I thought I should make
breakfast for everyone.
Okay listen, how long have
you been here?
A few months have passed,
actually I got admission
at a university here.
And for how long are you
planning to stay?
Actually it isn't appropriate to live
at someone else's house,
no matter how close they are.
I've heard you don't have a father,
who pays your fees?
My fees?
The neighbors collect
donations to pay it,
but don't worry
I won't ask you.
If you have another question
then ask away,
I have proper answers
to every question.
Mother, I've set the breakfast,
I've told everyone about the breakfast,
now I'm going to clean up.
Okay, but first of all, my elder
daughter-in-law Sweetie,
clean her room.
See, she came from broad,
they don't have dust in their houses,
her room should shine like a glass.
Don't worry mother,
just see my magic.
Rania my child, come sit with me.
It’s our house, my child,
what happened? You look upset.
Grandmother, here you go, car keys.
Give them to Aunt Sweetie
and tell her she can take the car
if she wants to go shopping.
You did really well my child,
Sweetie is also a part of the family,
what good is fighting with family?
I’ve made a decision,
now just waiting to see
if it results good or bad.
I think you made a right decision.
See, Sweetie isn’t a bad person,
since she got here,
she’s trying to adjust with us,
and we should support her.
Mother your maid came back
but I made breakfast
with my own hands,
I also served it on the table,
just going to get the fresh juice.
You did really good,
I want to try the breakfast
my daughter-in-law prepared,
it’ll taste different.
Rania, come and help aunt.
No, no, let it be mother,
she’s a guest, today she’s here,
tomorrow she’ll be somewhere else.
I can’t expect a guest to help.
I’m understanding really well,
what you’re trying to convey to me.
Where are you going? Breakfast.
I’m not hungry.
Oh you naughty girl,
I understand everything,
you want to go out in the name
of university
then you’ll have fun and
go to the restaurants, right?
I should eat.
Me too.
Excuse me.
You want egg?
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
Young kids,
they have bigger appetites.
Thank you, thank you,
Sweetie, thank you.
Carefully Dabeer,
don’t burn any dress,
or what am I going
to tell your mother?
Sorry, sorry, Sweetie.
There as such soft fabrics,
I am afraid to put a cold iron on it
and you want me to hot iron these?
What am I going to do?
Dabeer, talk less and work more.
I already thought of so many other
chores that you are going to do.
Have mercy on me Sweetie,
I was wrong to come here,
I’ll never come back to Pakistan
in my life again.
I swear on my father.
If you want me to, I can draw lines
with my nose like this.
Don’t try to act oppressed,
do you understand?
What do you think,
why am I asking you to do all this?
It’s good for you it’s adding your points,
when people will appreciate your wife,
won’t you like it? You will, right?
I would, I would like it very much,
my example is like
that daughter-in-law
that works like a donkey all they
and the daughter takes credit
at the end of the day.
Right?
You’ve been speaking a lot since
you came back to Pakistan.
Mahir, this is your step-mother
but both are exactly the same.
Both are dramatic.
95, 96, 99,
10,000.
Sister I completed 10,000 steps.
Shehenshah, take this,
have some water, you must be tired.
Yes, yes, drink it.
I’ve brought a lot of gifts
for you from America.
You don’t say. Give me.
Not now, I will give it
to you later, later.
Hey Rania, you’re back so soon
from the university?
Well now that you’re back so soon,
go and work in the kitchen, go.
What are you saying aunt,
I’m a guest,
and guests don’t do the house chores.
And also I didn’t come from the university
to work in the kitchen,
what are you saying?
Wow, whose bike is this? Friend’s?
Why would it be friend’s? It’s my own.
Can I ride it?
You can ride it later, but first,
come let me give you a round on this.
No, I want to ride it on my own.
Yes, yes, ride it,
come on.
Shehenshah,
take my bag inside.
Hold tight.
Bye.
Now it’s decided,
now you both will travel on the bike,
you won’t get the car ever.
Madam Sweetie has decided.
Greetings Doctor.
Greetings.
That, you.
You came alone?
It wasn’t an occasion to bring along a band,
so I had to come alone.
No, I meant to say, Rania.
I mean, Ms. Rania also had to come,
father was telling me.
Yes, Rania had to come,
but Mahir was there and she had to go
with him so she couldn’t come.
Why?
Were you waiting for her?
Obviously,
when you know come has to come,
you wait for them.
Did you tell Rania?
What?
That, that you miss her.
No, when did I say that?
You didn’t say but understood
without saying.
You like meeting and
talking to Rania.
But you’re scared to even
admit it to yourself, right?
Maybe.
Okay, I’ll do one thing,
I’ll talk to Rania for you,
I’ll say what you are not able
to express.
No, no, no, don’t do this,
I think I should be the one telling
this to her.
Yes, you’re right doctor.
Well, I loved to hear
this secret from you.
Rania is a really sweet person,
you’ve made a perfect decision.
Thank you.
Okay tell me, where is father?
Father, is in his room,
I don’t know
why he has been sad lately,
he seems lost.
That’s why I was saying,
father would’ve liked it
if Rania had come.
Can I meet him? I’ll check
his blood pressure
and you know my company is great,
he’ll be happy with me.
Please.
What will be the reaction of Rania
after listening to me?
Mahir seems to like having
a right over Rania,
so do they have something?
Where did you bring me?
I told you I don’t want to go very far.
Hey it doesn’t matter Rania, get off.
Today I’ve bought a new bike,
in the joy of getting a new bike
I’m giving you a treat.
Randomly?
Forceful treat?
I don’t want it, I told you we’d stay
near the neighborhood.
Okay dude,
but we’re here already,
look how nice the restaurant is,
and how delicious the food would be.
Come in.
I told you, I don’t want to eat,
take me home.
Are you having issues
with your dressing?
Because this is a nice place
and you’re dressing like this,
is it the reason?
I don’t care about such things,
only you are concerned with the outfits
because your thinking starts from
the shoes and ends with the dresses.
I have a very progressive mindset,
and I’m happy the way I am.
And secondly,
if you spend here then you’ll have to
tell your new mother when we reach home,
and I don’t want her dollars
to be spent on me.
Oh, no, no.
I bought this bike with my own money,
I get rent for the property,
and the treat I’ll give you,
it’ll also be my money.
Come on dude,
let’s go inside, please.
Can I ask why are you being
so kind to me?
You have a lot of friends,
then why me?
Just,
because I wanted to give you a treat.
You want to, but I don’t,
and I’m not obligated to your wants,
do you understand?
So you go inside, eat, drink, enjoy.
I’m taking a rickshaw to home.
Hey, stop, stop, stop.
Do you know you’re a little crazy.
Not a little, I’m completely crazy, happy?
Now I’m going.
Okay wait, stop.
Sit, I’ll drop you.
Sit and hold tight,
I’ll ride fast I’m angry.
No, you’re ungrateful, it’s enough
now pack your bags.
You, here?
Yes it’s my home,
it’s my choice wherever I sit.
Well it’s your love that
you think of this as your own house.
No, no, no, no. It’s my dollars
that make me this of this house
as my own.
Oh, why are you discussing
these boring things?
Let me show you something.
Look at this,
darling Khawar gave me a gift.
It’s really expensive.
Very nice,
your Khawar seems not only rich
but generous as well.
Yes, and not only Khawar,
his father, his brother
all of them are generous,
that’s why I got her engaged
to that family.
If I had left it on her she would have.
Okay, enough,
she understood.
You don’t have to tell everything why are you
always trying to make fun of me, be quiet.
This, Rania and Mahir used to go for
such outings for so long earlier as well?
What can I say, we don’t have enough
spare time to keep an eye on others.
When will Rania come?
Oh, what do you think,
she’ll be back soon?
Don’t even think like that.
She went with Mahir,
she’ll roam around and
spend his money,
and anyway does anyone
say no to a free party?
She won’t be back on time,
keep in mind.
These middle-class girls from
small cities are like this.
Well, she won’t get Mahir
or this property.
Hello.
Hello.
Why are they looking at us like this?
Habitual, getting jealous.
You love to act, let’s do this.
Greetings. Greetings.
You went for a round,
it took you too long.
Actually, aunt Sweetie,
I’m a middle-class, naive,
narrow-minded girl
from a small city,
so when I saw the lights here
I was amazed,
didn’t want to come back.
Hey Rania, what are you saying?
Why hide from them?
Actually aunt Sweetie you know
I bought a new bike.
So for that, I took her for a treat,
then for dinner then juice
we got late in all that.
Well Rania,
you were absolutely right,
the car isn’t as much fun,
compared to roaming around
the city on a bike.
If you’ve bought a new bike,
will you only give a treat to her?
Not to us?
Yes, she’s right, all of us want a treat.
Oh yes, I’ll call Khawar as well.
Well no,
you’ll go to some casual place,
and my darling is used to of going
to 5-star hotels in Karachi.
If he eats at small places
he’ll get food poison,
you know food poison.
Stop it madam,
keep your mouth shut,
I know you and your
monkey husband very well,
you’re talking.
He grew up in front of me
in my city,
I know him since his childhood.
After school, he grew up buying chicken
claw soup from roadside cart for 15/- rupees.
You’ve insulted her recent fiancé,
let her show off
In front of aunt Sweetie.
She is newly engaged,
it’s justified.
Well not everyone gets a fiancé,
only the fortunate ones get fiancé.
Tell me more, how is Bebo,
did you find a suitor for her?
Well we should all pray for her,
her aunt is getting old but
she’s not getting any proposals.
My Bebo gets proposals all day,
there is a queue for proposals
but my Bebo is not desperate like Mona,
to get any cartoon and
get engaged instantly.
Do you remember,
remember how khawar was looking
at his engagement?
At Asma’s age girls shouldn’t be choosy,
we compromise at this age.
Age doesn’t matter aunt Sweetie,
whatever one has in his fate he gets it.
Take your example,
when you married my father
you were 10-15 years older than Bebo,
yet you found a gem like my father, right.
So Bebo will find as well.
Dabeer,
I’ll go and see what Dabeer is doing.
And you, listen to me very clearly,
don’t brag all the time,
your fiance?
The one with the face of a dead snake,
talk to him only.
That’s what happens to people
who hurt their elder sisters.
