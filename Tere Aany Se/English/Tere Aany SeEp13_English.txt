What happened?
Why are you so angry.
You were fine a minute ago.
I have decided!
and I am certain that I will study law
and be a lawyer.
well, okay that's great.
why are you so angry?
I am angry because of another thing.
I was being polite because I thought
that person was born sad.
but no, that man deserves
no politeness.
Who? What are you talking about?
There’s a limit to being self-obsessed.
I swear I am not going
to be discreet now
I am going to my room.
No, wait, why?
Stay, we’ll hang out,
watch TV and eat snacks.
The circumstances are no longer
suitable for hanging out.
I am going.
what did you say to her?
what?
Why would I say anything to her?
I don't have the time to engage
with stupid people.
and that one isn't just stupid,
she's also insane
what has gotten into you brother?
She's a very nice girl; don’t say that.
only you think that.
you have offended the poor thing.
you were right,
No one respects you in this house
and now you have proof
this house is run by Ammaji
and Mahir only
Every decision is made
by those two
Yeah, that’s plausible,
but what has happened to Mahir?
He has become even more cold
and apathetic than the last time.
he used to be so frank with me
when I first came here
but now, he doesn't even
properly talk to me
His face gets so expressionless
when he sees me
that is not his fault
it’s all that Rania’s doing
she’s has got him under her hands
yeah, I don’t like her
that is why I have called you here
so you can take control of Mahir
as soon as possible
our lives will get so much better
once that happens
What do I do?
I keep trying, but he doesn't
even look at me?
don't lose hope.
If that doesn't work,
then I have other ways of
getting what I want.
I have made up my mind;
I'll get you married to Mahir.
the only girl Mahir will ever marry is you.
Doctor
yes?
my throat hurts really bad and
this medicine doesn't work at all
please prescribe me a new one
you want me to hand you a piece of magic
that will solve all your troubles
you people don’t take care of yourself at all
here, take you file
there has to be a limit
A doctor’s medicine doesn't help a patient
as much as a kind smile does
okay so don't worry
God willing, you will be fine
just taking this medicine on time
and come back for checkup in 2 days
okay?
take this medicine on time
Yes, I will but tell me one thing,
are you feeling alright?
He's fine, uncle.
you have got your medicine now leave!
bye.
Get the next patient.
That was the last one.
really?
Tell me one thing.
Ask away.
Why did you get so worried?
I wanted to ask about that friend of yours
who would take care of the patients
around the hospital.
Are you still in contact with her?
You must be asking about Rania?
Rania? Yes, her.
How is she?
We don't talk that often,
but these days she’s very busy
with her new mission.
mission?
What mission?
Yes, sir, she’s trying to help
four people find love.
four people?
Sorry Sir, I’ll explain better
Two of them are husband & wife,
and the issue is that society
is keeping them apart.
and the other two are single,
and their issue is also the society
keeping them apart.
Oh, well the next you speak with her ask her
how she is on my behalf.
she’s a nice girl
You remember her?
People like her cannot be forgotten
It’s time for the walkaround
Tell me, have you eaten yet?
me?
Yes you, who else is here?
okay?
I didn’t even bother to ask the doctor.
I guess Dr. Wasiq’s screws got fixed.
His tone is filled with sweetness
instead of bitterness.
Come in!
You took so long
teacher should be punctual
Yeah, sure, tell me
if I am dressed appropriately.
Will Ammaji be impressed?
According to historical evidence,
no Ammaji cared about a man’s attire when deciding
whether or not he should be her son-in-law.
What matters is the man’s education,
his disposition, his character, and his status.
Dude, I have all of those things.
Don’t worry.
blowing your own trumpet,
I see.
Sit down; I’ll bring the kids’ mother.
Why the kids’ mother?
Bring Ammaji.
I am very eager to impress her
please!
Shenshah!
Shenshah, where are you?
Ammaji, look who’s here.
This is Farhad from next door
Greetings! Ammaji.
Greetings! Greetings!
You’re lucky that I am in a
very good mood today.
And you’ll be even happier to know
that Mr. Farhad here will now
tutor Tipu and Mano.
But is there a shortage of educated folks
at our own house
that you have to ask
the neighbour’s help?
Ammaji it was very hard
to convince him
You know how hard it is
to deal with our kids,
and he’ll be tutoring them for free.
Oh, okay, okay.
Thank you so much!
we are very grateful to you for agreeing
to tutor our stupid children
I’ll go bring them in
God knows where they are
Tipu! Mano!
Come see who’s here.
Your master is here to tutor you
Listen to me,
call Rabail
At Least I’ll get to see her.
I will break your legs.
Greetings!
Go sit and study!
I’ll study tomorrow, Mama.
No, not tomorrow, Sit over there and study.
What’s wrong with studying today?
See what a good and well-dressed
tutor you have.
Do you think
he has nothing else to do?
Is he an idiot, insane, or a donkey
that he is here to tutor you?
bring out your books and study.
Greetings!
Thank you so much for tutoring my kids
I’ll go get Mano as well
Tipu, get your books out.
Hello?
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Which book should I open?
Any book that you can read
without my help will do.
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Is this fine?
Yes, that’s fine.
Do you know the ABCs?
read that.
Are you serious?
I cannot believe our very own rude doctor
is exhibiting signs of kindness.
It seems as though he wants to kiss
and hug all the patients.
he has been mingling
with everyone a lot
You should come;
you’ll be surprised to see him.
I am coming,
this is not something
one should miss out on.
Your words have real weight, Rania.
Yes, they do,
I can make them all behave.
Except the feral cat
who lives in this house
He just keeps misbehaving.
I see, you are talking about that
handsome boy, right?
To be honest, his attitude suits him.
Okay, stop it now,
there’s no need to sing his praises.
by the way, you are very lucky to be
blessed with a hero like Mahir.
I see you can’t stop
singing his praises.
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you so much!
You have not only made
my journey easier;
you have also laid down
a soft rug on the road.
I can now meet Rabail
any time I want.
Anyway, I should go,
I’ll visit the hospital soon.
Well, okay, talk later.
Okay, goodbye!
What were you saying?
You seem pretty happy.
I am sorry you were on a call
and I interrupted you.
Actually, Ammaji not only had tea
made for me,
she also joined me for…
What’s that proper word?
Sipped?’
You mean she sipped tea with you?
What? No.
What’s that word?
Savor! Yeah
She savoured tea alongside me.
she also interviewed me and
she sat super close to me.
Do you think you’ll be able
to clear that interview?
My name is Farhad and
Farhad never loses.
Well, congratulations
but let me tell you these interviews
are a bit different from the rest.
Even the best of the conquerors can fail
Don’t scare me.
Now that you have helped me so much,
can you do one last thing?
plan a picnic or outing someday.
I want to spend the day in a refreshing
and peaceful place with Rabail.
Hey, don’t expect that from me.
I have helped you enough.
I don't understand why people get
so out of hand after falling in love.
If you love her that much
then propose,
and once you are engaged
I don’t care if you go out for coffee
or spend the day at a broken park bench
saying you love each other.
No one would object,
do you understand?
This girl is so cruel.
Dear God, please make her fall in love
with some as well.
Ameen.
yes!
cream cake!
this isn’t for you.
I made this for Mahir.
ordered,
Same thing.
And for your kind information Mahir
and I will be having tea together.
And we have been very close friends
since childhood.
We have an understanding.
And soon that friendship will be
turning into something more.
What?
Why did no one tell me that?
This is breaking news.
Two clowns together!
Everyone in the family and the neighbours
will be in God's protection.
What did you say?
Oh look, Mahir is here.
Mahir, come sit.
The tea is getting cold.
Where is everyone else?
Don’t worry about everyone else
and have some tea.
And listen—why are you here?
Don’t you…
Oh, yes, I was just about to sit.
I meant you can’t sit here because
you have to go assist my sister in the kitchen;
she may need your help.
Go!
Wow, look at the preparations at the table
for the evening tea today.
Bring me some tea as well.
wow.
Why is there sugar in my tea?
Is it too much? It’s okay,
try this cake instead.
Cake and sugar,
I don't eat such things.
It'll compromise my diet.
Give me some tea and
cut me a piece of cake.
It looks delicious.
yes definitely.
Let's eat it together.
I'll give you some now.
It looks so tasty.
Give me a fork.
I'll eat it with a fork as well.
one minute!
Mona, where did you order
this cake from?
It's so tasty.
Very tasty!
Very, very tasty!
Mona, my love, If you do this every day,
I swear it’ll be a treat.
I wouldn't mind that.
There’s no cup left for Mona;
how will she have her tea?
That's no issue; we can always
make more tea.
Try this nugget.
Do you want some?
Actually, no, it might mess
with your diet.
We’ll eat it.
Give me some of those biscuits,
Forget the biscuits,
try this yellow thingy.
That’s tart! Lemon tart.
Come in, Come in.
Easy.
I can’t believe you came to
my house on your own accord.
I am here to meet Auntie and Laiba.
Right! You girls are so clever.
I know why you are here.
You are here to meet me.
Say that in front of Rania,
and she’ll let you know
what clever means.
Why are you getting upset?
Come in.
Mama! Mama!
Look who’s here.
the whole house is brightened
because of her.
If you are going to say stupid things,
I'll leave.
Mama’s here.
Greetings! Auntie.
Greetings! Rabail, you’re here?
Why are you standing there?
Come! sit!
She thought you weren’t home
and she wasn’t coming in.
She thinks if there are no women
in the house, she shouldn’t come.
That’s just how smart girls think.
come! sit!
Where’s Laiba? Call her.
Greetings! Uncle.
It's Ayaz.
Greetings! Sister Rabail,
how are you?
You've come after so long.
I get so bored around the house,
you should come here more often.
Laiba, you should visit her as well.
They’re great people;
there are no restrictions from me.
By the way, my mom doesn't like
a lot of people.
That's probably
why I am still unmarried.
Because my sister doesn’t like anyone.
Shut up, Ayaz!
You always do this.
what happened? I mean,
was there a tragedy?
It's a very long story,
and it’s also super boring.
So, if you know anyone, I mean,
if there’s anyone in your friends circle
Who has an older sister,
even a divorcee,
who’s interested in getting married
or someone who hasn’t found their ideal.
you can refer them to me.
Don’t you worry.
I’ll ask Rania
and she’ll do anything to get you married
Even if she has to split up another couple
What, really? She sounds like
a woman of quality
I'll contact her myself.
My nephew has made her his sister
and that makes her my niece as well
Ayaz, please shut up.
Child
Where does your parents live?
My parents are no more
in this world,
they died in my childhood,
and since then, me and my elder sister
lives with my grandmother’s house.
Oh! Sorry,
I wasn’t aware of it, I hurt you.
No, aunt, it’s not like that.
How is she?
what does he do?
He has his own salon.
It’s not that good, next.
Okay one minute,
how is he?
He is crazily love with me,
he said that he will bring moon
and stars for me.
And what he does?
He loves me.
And?
He does something?
What?
He has his own phone shop,
and he gifted this phone to me as well
You look happy.
I am very happy,
I went to Farhan’s house.
Wow
And his family is better than him.
Great.
I will just come.
Okay.
greetings.
Greetings, come on,
you have a long age,
and Mona was missing you.
My son has done the shopping.
Yes grandmother,
I am famous in the city,
it is important to do shopping,
with these brands and all,
grandmother,
I have to do this,
Where are you going?
I am a big brand conscious person,
will you not give your opinion about
my shopping and spoil my mood?
I don’t interfere in people’s matter.
have you all listen to it children?
The change is there.
Mother, have you seen,
now if I will say anything,
he will get jealous.
Why can’t you both be friends?
You always argue with each other,
on small matters.
I don’t argue, at all,
I don’t want to talk to him as well
but he is there who always tried
to get free with me.
Me? She is stupid.
Child, she is a nice girl,
why do you mind
whatever she is saying?
I don’t understand,
are you my grandmother, or her?
Whenever you see,
you always support her.
Leave it child.
Mother, Raina should not talk
like this about our Mahir.
She is just joking,
you are taking this seriously
for no reason.
It wasn’t looking like a joke to me,
just leave your phone.
Have you noticed,
our Mona is so mature now.
Really?
What have you seen in her that
you are saying she is mature?
There is so much seriousness on her face
the forehead is also shining.
Leave it,
I can’t see properly,
so I can’t see all this,
but if you are saying,
so it is enough for me.
Go ahead.
Now you see mother, since
she came here she is in the house,
can you ask Mahir to take her out.
Mahir doesn’t have all the responsibility,
you can ask Hammad to take her out.
Sister,
Mother.
Yes?
Mother, we are going out to take some
book in the market,
we will come soon, lets go.
Wait,
Mona, get up,
and wear some proper dress,
you can go out with them,
you always want to go out.
No mother,
we are not going out
for some enjoyment,
we have to take 2 4 books.
Right.
Let’s go. Bye.
They are so happy,
they were ready too,
they are going to take books,
I am amazed.
What is your problem?
Nothing.
Thank God, we cut Mona off,

Yes, I was scared.
I think she mind it.

He is calling.
Receive the call.
Hello, yes, hello,

in the food court.
So what are you doing here?

Yes, you can go and have
a date with him,

Goodluck!
What will we do now?
Shopping.
No.
We will do shopping,
I am thinking please take
something from here,
there are so nice things over here,

There is 50% off right now.
Please exchange this brother
Sure sir, is there an issue in your size?
Size is fine, actually,
our prince six packs are not
getting prominent in these shirts.
What he is doing here?
we will be killed for sure.
We will be killed only when
he will see us, just step back.
He is joking,
I have other prints as well,
I don’t repeat the prints again.
We will get something new.
I will exchange it,

Okay come on.
This will look nice on you.
Yes, these prints are in these days,
I will also share.

He is here to shop.
Mahir, I am hungry,
let’s have food and then
we will do something else.
we just came here to shop,
and you are hungry.
Hungry.
Now will we shop
or have food first?
You earn in dollars,
still you are so miser.
I am not being miser, you will remember,
you have a rich friend,
first we will eat something and then
we will come again for shirt exchange.
Let’s go to food court.
Food court, sister.
Call sister
I don’t get my phone,
Do you have the number?
I don’t have the phone as well.
Oh, I am telling you today, with us, sister
and Arbab brother will be gone too.
We have to stop them.
Do something.
We have to stop them.
Please say something Arbab,
I miss you so much.
I miss you so much.
I miss you too.
its enough,
I mean we are husband and wife
and we have to meet like this,
if Rania would not have been there,
we would not have met yet.
You are right!
Please sorry, you know
that I become angry,
but you know this as well,
that I love you so much.
I also love you so much,
that is why I am sitting here,
otherwise,
I would not have come here,
I just pray that everything will be fine
and you will come home
as soon as possible.
yes, it will happen,
ask me how?
How?
Rania has taken over this matter,
she will handle Mahir brother
and mother.
Really?
What will you eat?
Tikka.
Your face is turning into Tikka as well,
lets eat something else.
Burger.
Thief, thief.
What are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
I came here for some work.
Where is the thief? Where is he gone?
There.
There?
what did he steal?
Her phone.
Where were you
when he took the phone.
In front of me.
I mean, where were you?
Lets check the CCTV camera.
But from where it has been stolen?
There.
There is CCTV.
I swear,
that house is like a zoo without you.
Yes, Khawar told me.
There is a lot of fuss and
you don’t stop being romantic.
What happened?
its just 5 minutes I am being romantic and
I met my husband after so long.
If you will not go from here
in 2 minutes,
then you cannot see
the face of sister again,
because Mahir brother is in the mall,
and he is coming here, run from here
Are you mad?
She is my wife,
you are saying as if I will be
caught I will get infamous.
Yes, husband and
wife doesn’t go on date,
but you please go from here.
Are you asking me to leave?
I miss you.
Love, if we will be alive,
we will meet again,
I'll see you soon.
lets go.
Come from here.
If you both will get caught,
it would have been so bad,
Mahir brother will tell you so much.
You are saying right Raina,
you have done a good trick,
good,
they both were worried that
what is going on.
Okay, before mother will come here and
she will ask you the reason of your laugh.
So go in your room please.
Yes, mother will ask us to show the books
that we went to purchase.
Yes, lets go.
He was telling me he will fix me.
Oh God,
please get me out of here,
it must be someone,
Greetings, uncle,
how are you this is Rania?
greetings,
how are you Rania?
Is everything okay?
Is there any problem there?
Leave it this matter.
That means,
there is some problem,
don’t be scared,
tell me what is the matter?
Everything is fine,
but your son,
I guess, he doesn’t like me
staying here.
Why child?
You are very nice.
He doesn’t think like this,
he thinks, since I am here,
my expenses have been increased,
I am thinking that I will start
giving him my expense.
He is thinking like this being
the child of Dabeer Hassan,
go and call him, I will fix him.
Not now, he will roam around the city
and will come late at night,
and do you know he comes late,
and no one ask him
where is he coming from,
of course,
if he will take the expenses
of the entire house,
then he will be proud anyways.
Oh God.
Do you know, he is angry always
and the whole family is scared
of his anger.
Listen to me, child, you don’t have
to get scared of his anger,
and whatever he says,
just ignore it,
this is your uncle’s house,
you can stay here easily, and
do keep me posted of everything.
Okay uncle, thank you so much, bye.
Bye.
Yes Mahir, now you will be fixed.
This problem is also solved,
I am tired.
Dabeer.
Yes, I am just mixing the coffee.
Come here.
Give me 5 minutes,
coffee will be here
Greetings father
Greetings
Are you awake?
Yes, I was waiting for you.
you are late.
Yes there was an emergency,
so I am late because of this,
my job is like this, I got late.
I was just waiting for you,
when you come, I see you
and sleep peacefully,
you had food?
No, father,
the patient was in the serious condition,
but thank God,
the patient was fine,
his parents were happy too,
I didn’t think of eating in all this.
Okay, servants were sleeping as well,
you just go and change,
I will pre hot the food.
No father, you don’t need to bother,
I feel ashamed.
What is there to be shameful off,
I didn’t have food too,
you just go and change.
okay.
Who is calling at this time?
Father.
Hello father, how are you?
The son of the father,
who is ill mannered,
who is insulting other people,
and being proud what kind of
a condition that father will be in?
I don’t know,
I am asking you how are you?
it’s good that you called me,
I was about to call you in a while.
Why?
Actually, I need some dresses child,
my friends.
Enough, I know that
my son only called me,
when he needs money.
I know father you are very busy there,
that is why I don’t want to call you
repeatedly,
whenever I have work for you,
I will call you.
I used to be very proud of you,
but you insulted me.
Why? what have I done?
You cannot be that innocent now,
you are exposed now.
Exposed?
What are you saying?
Are you joking?
The one whose life is a joke
by his child,
how can he do joke,
don’t do this, you still have time,
just look at your father,
I am still the same
in this freedom as well,
and you are in Pakistan and
ended all your traditions.
What have I done?
You came late in nights and no one
have the permission to ask you
that where were you?
Who said this to you?
No one has the courage
to complain about you,
you have pressurized everyone,
I am disappointed,
now you want to know
the name of the person
who told this to me, go to hell.
Its not like that father.
Hello...
Dabeer.
Yes.
I am coming.
the one who is saying the truth
that means she is a girl,
I know who she is,
but let me take the proves as well,
I will make her condition bad
that she will remember.
