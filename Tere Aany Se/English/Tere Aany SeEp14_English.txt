I don't know why I've been having
an intense headache since morning.
How do I tell?
Make tea for me.
Tea doesn't cure headaches,
I'll oil your hair and give
a head massage.
No, I don't want to get my hair oiled.
Hey, try it once at least.
Grandmother,
yesterday, father called me.
Really? What was he saying?
He was asking about you,
I told him you have to offer
prayer early morning
so you sleep early at night.
It’s me, a wanderer
who roams around with friends,
and comes home late.
That's why I attended the call.
Mother, I should bring the heated oil.
Wait, where are you going?
Listen to what father had to say.
What am I going to do about it?
He is your father,
he can say anything.
Oh, no, no, Rania.
You were mentioned a lot yesterday.
You should hear about it.
Mine?
Random, casually.
No, no one is discussed randomly.
Grandmother,
father is becoming her fan.
The stories of her greatness,
her qualities and her purity
reached America.
And father became her fan.
I told him to call her to America.
That'd be great right?
This way our country would be spared of
this backbiting and backstabbing girl.
My child now you should go
get the hair oil for me.
Go get it.
Yes.
Oh wow Mahir,
today you're at home.
What is she saying,
was she the one who complained
about me to father?
What do you mean?
What are you trying to say?
Just that,
if not the people at your home than
at least care about your guests.
That's also a tradition
at your house,
to respect your guests,
give them attention.
Right grandmother?
My child, are we not taking care of you?
What do you need, tell us.
I want to go out somewhere.
She must've done it.
When my guests will be here, I'll give
them attention and respect them as well.
But for backstabbers like
them I have no respect
and nor do I have any space
in my home.
I really dislike the people
who are always complaining.
Mahir
Pathetic.
What are you saying?
Chaos.
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.
We're done, we're done.
Come on children, game over.
Let's go inside, open your bags
and take out your books.
Your teacher is coming
to teach you.
No sister Rania,
he won't be coming today.
Who told you that?
He, himself.
Hey, Khawar,
come inside if you're already here,
where are your pupils wandering?
Oh uncle, welcome.
How are you?
Oh child, forget about us,
tell us what's the situation here?
Everything is alright.
And anyway, in my presence,
God only write peace.
Listen to me sister,
is brother Mahir inside?
I'm telling you, if I'm here you don't have
to be worried or afraid.
Come on, let's go inside.
Come on.
Let's go my child, have courage.
Let's go.
Come on.
Mano, throw the ball.
Mother,
place your hand on your heart
and answer me honestly.
Should we or shouldn't we misbehave
with the guests at home?
Here we go.
She complained to you.
Your sister does not know
anything else.
She's always causing a scene
or complaining.
Even if she has 10,000 things to do,
she'll leave everything to make time for this.
Mother, she has a small,
fragile heart.
She's crying ever since
and she's still crying.
Well Mahir you misbehave
with her a lot.
At least think about me
I'm your aunt.
Mother, see who's here.
Who's here?
Come on and check
for yourself who this is.
Is it an appropriate time
for someone to come?
Oh God.
Chaos.
Come on in Mother.
Come on.
Here they are.
Greetings sister.
Greetings, greetings.
Have a seat.
Let me get sister Saman
Stop, stop, stop, wait a minute.
Why are you in a hurry?
Let us talk first.
Rafique Ahmed,
what lead you here?
Sister, you're requested
to get Saman called.
Sure, go call Saman.
I'll get her.
Hey Shehensha,
prepare some tea, go.
Yes? Speak.
Let Saman come,
then we'll tell.
Greetings.
Greetings my child, live long.
Come, come sit with us.
Sister, we won't take much time.
Arbab.
Here, mother,
we've bought the papers.
You can check this,
this is what you wanted?
Sister, I've transferred my house
to Saman's name.
Well whatever
I own is for my children.
But still respecting your wishes,
I've named my house
to Saman in my life.
Give it to her.
No, keep it Rasheed Ahmed, keep it.
Keep the papers, keep your properties.
It was only about values.
May she stay happy at her house.
That's it.
Take this.
Uncle,
I only need your love and prayers.
Sister, now can we take the honor
of our home with us?
Why not.
I'll get Ammad,
she should be here on this event as well.
Yes, call her.
Live forever, uncle Rafique.
This is how great people are,
the ones who do not value money
and properties.
Instead, people are important to them,
they value their daughter-in-laws
and daughters.
Wow uncle,
I swear you made us
all delighted today.
I hope, the young ones could learn
from the elders as well.
I should get something sweet
for this joyous occasion.
What happened?
You're escaping quietly today?
Aren't you going to ruin anything today?
Bye.
Take care.
Go to your home with happiness.
May God keep you happy and healthy.
Okay sister, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye. Let's go, son.
Bye.
Finally, my child went to her home.
Let's go, let's go.
Thank God,
my child went back home.
Hey, you could've come
to see off your sister.
The whole caravan went to see her off,
was I important?
Why are you angry now?
You don't understand grandmother.
They were showing off their wealth.
"We don't have a problem in transferring
a tiny house to Saman's name "
All of it was a show,
they just wanted to degrade us.
Here we go, new chaos.
They're such good people.
They've given so much respect
in agreeing to mother.
Or they could've stayed away
by taking this as a problem for their ego.
You shouldn't say anything
in the matters of our home.
Go inside.
Do not breathe fire at all times.
It's enough for us that they heard us
and took our daughter with respect.
Okay,
but if Saman ever comes back here
after a fight or argument,
don't say anything to me.
I won't engage in her matters
today onwards.
You shouldn't worry,
they'll value her,
take care of her.
They're good people.
We'll see!
Thank God our plan succeeded and
sister Saman is finally at her home.
All credit goes to you.
If you hadn't gone to uncle Rafique’s house
and told brother Arbab
that sister has become sick
by missing him
and she needs his love,
not his wealth.
Without you saying all this,
he wouldn't have come here.
You should praise my plan.
Wow what a brilliant thing
you have done.
Is this praise enough?
Or do you want more
Coming into someone's room
without permission is unethical,
I guess no one taught you that.
Poking your nose in someone's
family matter is also unethical,
guess no one taught you that.
Saving other people’s homes
is a blessing
and I can proudly say that
I have earned this blessing.
Your father and my uncle Dabeer
has given me this authority.
And he said that if their stupid son
interferes in my business
then I should inform him so he could
knock some sense into you.
So that was you,
you told lies about me to my father.
You’ve manipulated the truth so much
that he’s angry and disappointed in me.
Because of you, I got angry
at that poor Mona.
Oh! That poor Mona.
quickly go and talk to her what if
she complains about you in real?
I’ll get back at you.
Okay.
Is he mad?
He heard everything.
So what?
We are not afraid of anyone.
Hi Ifrah, yes.
Hi Mahir,
how are you?
I am good, now get to the point,
why did you call?
Mahir,
mother and father are back from
London can you come over?
I can but, I guess I should come,
I am not in a good mood I guess visiting
you people will cheer me up.
Good, come quickly
and bring Rania with you,
grandmother really misses Rania
I have to bring Rania?
Then the plan cancelled,
I am not coming.
Why are you showing
so much attitude Mahir,
I already told you Grandmother
is waiting for both of you.
I am not talking to her.
Oh then I will call Rania,
and I will talk to her so you don't have
to worry about anything.
You just have to bring her here
what the heck.
You’re getting a call.
Here.
Yes Ifrah?
Rania, grandmother is missing you,
I have talked to Mahir
so you can come with him.
Elders are calling me and
I won’t come? That’s just not possible
of course, I will come,
just don’t worry.
Okay, okay. Bye.
It was Ifrah,
her grandmother has become my fan.
God,
how long is it going to take
for him to get ready?
Well the man who takes so long in getting
ready will never succeed in his life.
Yes Ifrah?
I have been ready for so long,
I am waiting for your best friend.
Can you just call him again
and ask if he is ready?
Strange.
Here we go, Prince is here
he is dressed up as if
he is going on dinner.
Wow you came so early,
only my feet are hurting yet,
you could've come after I fainted.
Okay, okay I will fulfill this wish
of yours as well,
now can we go?
Or do you want to keep standing here?
Take it easy,
like this,
it is a car, not a rickshaw.
Calmly.
The smell of a new car is just
out of this world.
You should thank me
that you're sitting in this car
because of me,
lucky you are.
Yes Of course when the car is
from father's hard-earned money
then it feels even better.
There is an entirely different joy
from father's money.
You know how the saying goes,
nobody understands the value of free stuff.
you've said something useless
exactly like your mind.
Taking you because I'm forced to,
only because of Ifrah I have let you
sit in my car.
I am also going because of Ifrah,
Ifrah’s sick Grandmother wants
to see me she is missing me.
You know what,
that once I meet someone they wish
to meet me again and again.
Allah has given me such a personality
But even once in my life
I get arrogant about it.
yes your personality is just like that,
cunning, clever and
excessive overacting.
You make a fool out of people because
you are clever and act innocent.
Be thankful to me that
I allowed you to sit with me,
so just sit with your mouth shut.
your voice sounds like someone
has burned my ears,
I get a headache by listening to you.
And listen
I am taking you there,
if I saw you trying to show fake love
to anyone you will see my anger.
What is this fake love?
Whoever I meet I meet them
wholeheartedly,
don’t think of me like you.
and who are you trying to scare?
I am not scared of anyone.
I haven’t scared you yet,
when I will scare you for real you
will run for your life.
Looks like father’s scolding
was not enough for you
that’s why you are still in attitude.
Thank you for reminding me,
apologize to Mona
when we will return.
Wow,
where did this Mona come from,
listen I didn’t say anything to your Mona.
I don’t even talk to her much,
if she is in a bad mood
it is not because of me.
Anyways look what love is,
such an arrogant person became
mellow for his lover.
Can’t even bear her anger, and.
Wait a second,
who are you calling my lover?
Mona, who else?
Your childhood love,
well you can tell just by looking at her
that she is childhood’s mistake,
people do get smarter by adulthood.
and you?
You are not even smart as an adult.
Looks like you have done some sort
of specialization in stupidity.
Don’t say her name
in front of me again.
Did she fall from the sky?
I shouldn’t be taking her name,
or blaming her.
and you keep yelling at me?
Making fun of me?
God will ask you about it.
Shut up, I’m only doing this out of compulsion.
God please allow me to fix him.
Shut up, shut up, shut up,
I have to sit with you just
because of compulsion.
Hey,
how are you?
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you Mahir, for bringing her here.
I only brought her here because of
your grandmother’s wish.
And please tell your grandmother
to make such illogical demands again.
Actually Salik’s mother
visited unannounced
and she cannot know that
you both are not engaged.
That’s why you have to act like that.
What?
What?
What do you mean?
No, no.
I am not in the mood of having
this relationship even as a joke.
What are they going
to think about me?
Such a nice girl and
such a bad choice.
Oh hello?
What bad choice?
Please, Rania.
Please, just for my sake.
I was admiring you just this morning
with grandmother.
If she finds out that you are single,
she’ll definitely choose you
instead of me.
Please save my home.
Mahir, please convince her.
Okay,
just for the sake of your love,
I’ll choose this poison.
Even thinking about it makes me
want to vomit.
My heart feels weird.
My heart and mind both are not right
at the moment.
I would rather die than be
in a relationship with this man.
Kill her.
Rania, please just for my sake,
you won’t actually become his fiancé.
God forbid, my fate is not that bad yet.
Please explain to her.
Just for your sake, just for you.
I’ll tolerate this bitter person.
But this is the last time, I won’t be
able to act like this again.
Sure thing, it will never happen again.
Thank you so much.
Now do one thing,
exchange the rings.
What?
We’ll have to do this as well?
I’ll have to give this ring to her?
Ifrah.
What can I do?
You have to wear a ring to act like a fiancé.
Mahir, please.
I’m doing this out of compulsion.
Thank you.
Bring your hand forward.
See how she’s doing it.
Give it to me.
Is it your hands or ginger?
Look at her, how illiterate she is.
She doesn’t even know the ring finger,
look she put it on my thumb.
That’s exactly where illiterates like
you should wear it.
Oh I am illiterate?
And you’re a dean at some university?
At least I’m smarter than you.
Do not point fingers at me.
Do not raise your voice.
Please make your mood better,
Get in a better mood please, they’re waiting.
Now let’s go, please, without fighting.
What?
Why are you static?
Getting your picture clicked?
Come on.
You go ahead.
Come on.
Don’t touch me.
Now come.
Move.
Oh God.
Don’t touch me.
What happened?
They’re here.
Thank God.
They’d be here any minute.
What happened?
They were right behind me.
They’re here.
Greetings, greetings, greetings.
Greetings grandmother,
how are you?
Greetings, live long my child.
You both have a long life,
we were just talking about you.
Oh. You haven’t met this girl yet?
She’s such a good person,
her name is Rania.
And she’s also Mahir’s fiance.
Greetings.
Greetings, aunt, how are you?
I’m good,
congratulations to both of you.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Aunt, how are you?
I’m absolutely fine.
You should come here,
sit with me.
Yes.
No, no, aunt,
she loves me a lot.
She gets shy and doesn’t
sit with anyone else.
She won’t sit there.
How cute.
Right?
Rania you should visit often,
ask Ifrah how much I miss you.
A lot.
Don’t worry grandmother
if I’m here
From now on it’s my responsibility
to bring her here.
Right Rania? We’ll visit daily.
Yes.
Promise?
Promise.
Yes.
So did you guys get engaged
in the childhood?
No it’s.
She’s lying, it’s aunt,
don’t hide it from her.
I’ll tell you,
actually we got engaged
in early childhood.
Wouldn’t have I said no
if I were a grown-up?
We just exchanged
the rings a while back.
Now we only need your prayers.
He likes to crack jokes.
Oh,
so that means you both got engaged
with the blessings of your elders.
No.
Yes, yes, yes,
that’s exactly how.
Oh what are you doing love,
it’s all elders.
Don’t do this in front of them,
it looks inappropriate.
Please.
Wow, such a cute romantic couple.
It’s nothing like that brother Salik.
Oh she’s getting shy.
She’s really shy,
she acts like this in front of everyone.
And she gets really embarrassed
when she thinks about her activities
throughout the day, at night.
She’s like that sometimes,
not a problem.
How cute.
We really don’t have such
shy girls in this generation.
Ifrah, go and check
if the tea is served or not.
Go.
I’ll also go with Ifrah.
Oh she will manage,
you can take a seat.
Let go of my hand.
Complain a little more to my father.
Let go of my hand.
So, what is your plan for marriage?
Aunt, I planned on completing
my education first.
Then start a business and
then I’ll marry peacefully.
But her? Impatient.
She can’t wait,
she wants to get married
even this evening.
She’s insisting,
now what can I do?
Can’t ignore her wishes.
Tea is served,
please come.
Yes, yes, yes, let’s go,
have some tea.
Come on, have some tea.
Hey please,
get going.
Come.
What happened Mahir,
there is nothing on your plate.
You’re not eating anything?
Do you want something?
All of these are sweet.
Yes sure, I’ll take some.
Oh, I forgot Mahir,
you didn’t have breakfast
or the lunch.
What’s going to happen to me
if something ever happens to you?
Offer him something.
Here offer this.
Yes aunt, I’m completely aware
of his likes and dislikes.
This chocolate cake?
That’s his favorite.
Then give him.
Right Mahir?
I’ll get it for you,
I’ll fill your plate and
you’ll have to finish it.
Why are you taking that much?
I won’t be eating all of that.
Do you know
I bake this cake daily on his request,
I learnt it just for him.
Really?
The donut looks really appetizing,
we’ll have this as well.
Donut as well?
How colorful it is,
here you go.
You have to eat all this,
hurry up.
Yes, yes,
I’ll have it.
Start eating. Eat.
Yes, about to.
Seems like he’s getting shy,
please tell him not to be formal.
Yes.
Have it.
That small of a bite?
Take a bigger bite, please.
Good boy.
Mahir, you’re really lucky.
Where can you even find such
a caring and loving girl in this era?
He says the same.
He offers a prayer daily to thank God
that I’m in his life.
He loves me so much,
he doesn’t ignore anything that I say.
Right Mahir?
And, oh, look at it.
That’s why he’s not having the tea,
I didn’t add sugar.
Exactly 4 teaspoons.
4 teaspoons?
1, 2, 3, 4.
Here you have it, it’s hot.
Have it or it’ll get bad.
Oh, wait a second.
He says it increases love.
Aww.
Here you have it, take a sip.
Have something.
Did you see how loving he is?
Do you know he loves me so much,
sometimes I feel like I am living
in the old movies.
He sometimes loves me so much
that I can’t even process it.
If he could he’d sing for me
while hugging trees.
He admires me so much,
he says you’re so nice Rania,
you’re so intelligent.
You should be the prime minister
of this country.
By the grace of God,
you’re not only smart
you’re beautiful as well.
His life bloomed.
Yes!
Hey, you didn’t have the donut.
See, I have to force him to eat everything.
Okay have a bite with my hands.
It’s okay, I’m eating.
With my hands please,
just a little.
Just a little bit more,
open your mouth.
Another, another bite.
Good.
Okay, have it calmly.
Mahir, value her a lot after marriage,
take care of her,
and love her a lot.
In this generation,
you can’t find a girl like this
even if you look for them
with a searchlight.
Right?
Right.
She’s such a nice girl.
Yes, yes.
Reach home, I’ll tell you.
I’ll see you later.
Why are you so boring?
Play some music at least.
Stay quiet, “Play some music”.
If you say another word,
I’ll drop you off at the side
of the road right now.
Oh hello? I’m not that useless.
And don’t you remember
what Salik’s mother said?
Value me.
That’s how you value your fiance?
Why did you lie to Salik’s mother
like that?
Why did you tell her that
I’m crazy in your love?
A guy like me being crazy for you?
I don’t know what she must be
thinking about me.
I can’t even look her in the eye.
I’m embarrassed because of you.
You can possibly get embarrassed?
I don’t know what damned moment
it was when you met them.
Okay now, stop it.
How much are you going to cry?
I’m bored.
You’re a trouble,
not a girl.
What they must be thinking about me.
And did you look at grandmother?
She was admiring my fate.
And fate like this.
Let us reach home,
I’ll tell everything to grandmother.
Hey, calm down.
If I tell her about your deeds
that you were doing.
Holding hands, sitting close,
you won’t be able to show your face
to anyone at home.
Do you understand?
People should look at themselves
before complaining.
I’ve decided, from this day onwards
I’ll never take you anywhere with me.
You’re not even worth taking you anywhere.
Oh God, what did you just say?
If you won’t take me anywhere,
I’ll die in the confined walls of a house.
No, please don't be so cruel.
Get lost.
What do you think if you won't take me
anywhere so I won't be able to go anywhere?
I know how to ride a bike,
I know how to call a cab as well.
And then why did I have a boy
as close as my brother?
So I could rely on him.
And you know?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, let go of my hand.
I'm not leaving this ring with you.
Am I stealing it?
Who knows about you,
what if you sell it to get
two shirts for yourself?
Open the door first.
Hello madam.
Aren't you a little too early?
I don't know, didn't check the time.
Yes, you must've not felt
the time passing, right?
You're already educated enough,
what are you going to do
by getting more education?
What are you doing to do
by going to a university?
You're speaking like
you're paying my fees.
And what good is this illogical jealousy?
You've ruined yourself,
look at your face.
You look even older
than my mother.
Take back your words.
I don't take back anything.
Well whatever you say
doesn't matter to me.
Why are you so proud of yourself?
What even are you?
Ask this question to Mahir,
and he'll tell you in detail, okay?
You are back?
Do you care about anyone?
At least care about your best friend,
you don't care about me at all that
someone is here for you.
And I'm seeing that
you are blindfolded.
You don't care about me.
Look, Mona, I'm already too tired.
I don't know.
Can I listen to all your complaints
tomorrow?
Really?
Go away,
you'll only get back your senses
when your hands will be empty.
I got back my senses today.
Such sugary tea,
I've eaten so much of deserts
that I still feel weird.
I'm not letting Rania get away.
Okay listen, do you know,
she insulted me a lot, talk to her.
Does she respect anyone?
She insults everyone.
It must be someone really fortunate
if she respects him.
Hey?
Nobody listens to me,
nobody takes me seriously.
Now I'm up against this Rania.
I'll snatch Mahir away from her.
I'll let her know,
that I am Mona.
Children,
I can't see your sister,
is she not home?
She's at home.
What does it mean,
does she not know I'm here yet?
I don't know.
Can you please hurry, we have to go
for ice cream today with sister Rania.
Oh, that's a really good idea.
You won't be going there alone,
I'll join you.
Not only me,
but we will take Rabail as well,
she stays home all the time,
she's naive.
Okay, so call sister Rabail.
Her number is also switched off,
where is she?
Here you go, your tea.
Sister Rabail, today we're all going
for ice cream
and sir Farhad suggested that
you should come with us.
Me?
How can I go?
Just like how we are going.
But mother.
I'm teaching these devil's spawn just to get
a reflection of yours, getting my life together.
You can't come to get the ice cream?
How will you spend your life?
I'll spend it but convince
my family before that.
That's exactly what I'm doing,
I'm doing all this because of you,
and love makes us do all this.
Oh God,
so many people are sitting here
and none of you cared that
water is wasting for so much.
The country got into this situation just
because of the insensitivity of people like you.
Really? If you could you’d shoot us
with a canon.
Yes not a bad idea,
we have to do this for 3-4,
only then the rest will understand.
And you will be the first.
Why me? I’m such a harmless person.
You know what you should do?
Write Mahir’s name.
The world already has a lot of them,
the world would be better off.
This is not a bad idea.
What’s happening here?
What’s happening here?
We’re chatting and having a good time,
nothing of your concern.
There are books in front
of the children,
who’s teaching them?
You should be ashamed,
all of you should be ashamed.
Brother Maheer we’re going for ice cream,
do you want to join?
No one is going anywhere,
sit here.
And Rabail, go inside, go get inside.
Okay now, let’s continue the class,
take out your books.
And madam Rania, please
it’s time for them to study,
you can go inside.
Is this the time for ice cream?
Not at all.
Okay now, take out your books.
Sit properly.
Hey, what?
I was joking in front of him.
Shut up, you liar,
I don’t want a selfish friendship like this,
how can you be my brother?
Please try to understand,
it’s a delicate matter,
he’s my future brother-in-law.
