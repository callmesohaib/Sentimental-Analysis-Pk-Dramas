Bebo?
Uncle likes you.
I swear, since he heard you are leaving,
he is suffering from fever.
He is wandering here and there at home.
Bebo?
Do you also like uncle? Yes?
He is okay.
Then why are you going?
Because of aunt sweetie?
No matter what the reason,
I just can’t live here now. I must go.
Yes. That is right too.
He will come
with your proposal only when you will go. Bebo,
swear upon me,
don’t say no for the proposal.
Okay, I will see.
What is wrong with you?
It turns out to be so good that you came to Lahore.
Miyan Jee and mother will be so happy.
The search for you is over.
The search is indeed over.
Right?
Then be happy. Are you going crazy?
What is wrong with you?
It’s such a moment of happiness.
Okay, fine.
I am so happy.
I will finally wear a braid tassel.
Why? Grandmother?
Explain it to Bebo.
She just came,
and she is already talking about going back.
Actually, you people know sister-in-law and
Miyan Jee is alone there.
And Miyan Jee is sick as well.
So, that is why I will have to go.
Child, how can I stop you?
There is so much ominous in this house,
that even my soul wants to go somewhere.
Good morning. Good morning,
everybody.
She has come to speak her English.
Listen to me.
Did no one teach to greet?
Yes? Mother,
I am greeting everyone in my own style.
39,
There is such a good smell in the whole house.
Even in the back store.
Wow, it’s such a good atmosphere here.
Hmm.
One spends carefully
if he earns with hard work.
Here, everything is for free.
Cook however you like. Eat however you like.
Spend whatever you like. Hmm?
Hey, girl? Make me tea.
What is this “hey, girl”?
Her name is Rania.
Oho. Madam, Rania?
Please make me a cup of tea.
Yes. You will not take sugar, right?
Because someone must
save your halal dollars, right?
Listen? Don’t try to be clever.
I will take two tablespoon sugar
because this is my wealth.
And there is no shame in using your wealth. Got it?
Hmm. Yes.
Dabeer, darling?
Now this house should be
transferred to my name.
Now what did you do as such that
I get this house transferred to your name?
And that I should transfer all
my property to your name? Yes?
Listen to me.
This house belongs to my grandson.
It belongs to my heir.
No need to pour more salt than necessary.
Dabeer?
Tell your mother that
I am talking to my husband.
She should not interfere.
Don’t talk about your demands on the dining table.
I am not demanding anything.
I am saying the correct and
the right thing.
Sweetie?
You are taking undue
advantage of my leniency,
and speaking non-stop.
Fear that day when I will get angry.
Wow, mother. Wow.
Now mother is rightly excited.
I will definitely get this house
transferred to my name.
Rania?
You need to go to the university, right?
Come on, let me drop you.
Listen to me? Put the car keys here before going.
I need to go to shopping today.
You need to go to the kitchen,
rather than shopping.
Go make two-eggs’ omelette for me.
Your tantrums
and your mistakes has compelled me
to be a traditional mother-in-law.
Dabeer?
Are you listening to your mother?
Rania?
This spectacle will continue in this house.
Let’s go.
Bring your bag.
Let me drop you at the university.
Yes, I will go bring my bag.
Sweetie, darling?
I don’t want to be a sinner by interfering in your fight
between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.
Will you be a sinner
if you will take your mother’s side? Yes?
Dabeer,
do you the outcome of leaving your
wife among her enemies?
No.
No?
No. You don’t know?
No. No?
Oh! I died.
Oh, God!
You are laughing with your teeth open.
Yes?
I will make you stop laughing.
Mother, are you watching? Yes?
I am being harassed mentally and by dress.
I am tired. I am tired in my own house.
I have never seen such a coward person in
my life ever.
Dabeer?
Come back to your place.
Come back to your place.
Yes, yes.
I have… I have come back. I have…
Coward…
Oh, hello? Where?
I said I will drop you.
Come, sit in the car.
Thanks. But no thanks.
I am going on uncle Hammad’s bike.
See. Look…
Both the tyres of your bike are punctured.
Now you will not look good
mending the punctures.
No problem. I will drop you.
Come on. Let’s go.
Is this done by you?
Elders say that there is prosperity in movement.
Now not everyone is lucky like my uncle.
that one gets property without movement.
Anyway, don’t worry. I am here.
I will drop you. Come on. Come.
I don’t want to go with you.
Why are you throwing weird tantrums?
I am explaining you.
Can’t you understand it?
Look, I am already short-tempered.
Don’t be rude with me.
You cannot force me. Understood?
Well, listen, listen, listen, listen. Look?
I am sorry. I am sorry.
I am requesting you with love.
Rania,
I have something really important to talk to you.
Please, come with me.
Please.
I tried to stop aunt a lot.
But she left without informing me.
Oh, honey, child.
I came to search for peace for four days.
But I think I don’t have it destined for me.
I am stuck in problems after coming here.
Try to explain it to her. So,
what else am I doing, honey, child?
I am doing the same. I am trying to explain it to her.
But she doesn’t understand anything.
Honey, child?
I came to meet my family after 20 years.
But ever since this woman has come,
she has made this house a battlefield.
Instead of becoming the daughter-in-law,
she is acting like a wrestler here.
Aunt is doing such a wrong thing.
Hey, not just an ordinary wrong thing,
honey, child.
Hey, she embarrassed me in front
of the whole family.
You… You don’t worry.
I will talk to her. I will make her understand.
What will you explain to her?
She doesn’t understand anything anyone says.
Try it yourself. You will waste your efforts.
What should I do? I am stuck, honey, child.
I will talk to her, right?
And I will explain it to her in my own way.
And you will see.
She will change very soon.
Don’t worry.
Rania, you…
What should I say, man?
I would tell her had
she not been father’s wife.
I have been taught since childhood that
we should respect elders.
I don’t understand
what did she think before saying that?
Hey, that is my house.
Why should I transfer
my house to her name?
What a weird claim is this, man?
And you too?
You were sitting in front of her silently.
You are so ill-manner other ways.
You interfere in everyone’s fights.
But when it comes to me,
you are completely silent.
You couldn’t even speak a word in my favour?
Because my elders have taught me
to respect the elders.
And I am ill-mannered?
Then what are you?
What words will you use for yourself?
Man, look at this.
I am folding my hands in front of you.
I don’t want to fight with you at this time.
Man, I am worried.
I am stuck in this situation.
Give me any suggestion, any idea.
Something as such should happen that this lady
should go back to America forever and
never come back.
Greetings, doctor Wasiq.
How are you?
Greetings. I am absolutely fine.
You tell me. Where are you lost?
Father was also asking about you.
Hey, what should I tell you?
University has started. So, I am a bit busy.
But I will come pay you a visit.
When will you come?
I will come soon, don’t worry.
Well, talk to you later.
Take care, goodbye.
I have noticed,
whenever doctor Wasiq calls,
your face glows a lot.
There is so much glow in your house too.
Did I put any objection?
I mean if my small face glows a little bit,
you can’t even digest that.
They rightly say.
Everyone is jealous nowadays.
No one can digest anyone’s happiness.
Man, tell me something.
When you talk to everyone,
with so much love,
you talk while smiling and laughing,
but when my turn comes,
why do you make such a bad face, man?
It is not like that.
Actually, the thing is,
while looking at your rotting face,
my face has become like this.
What to do?
When will your class end?
I will come to pick.
No need to go through this trouble.
I will come myself.
Go home and take rest.
And plan against your stepmother.
Fine?
What should I think?
She has already made my life hell.
That time was amazing, by the way.
When it was your rule.
You used to show off in front of the whole family.
By wearing new and branded clothes,
you used to show off.
You used to weigh every person
with money.
By the way,
Mrs. Dabeer came and showed you the mirror.
Tell me one thing.
Are you at my side or hers?
Have you shaken hands with the enemies?
Hmm. I am not like rural people.
We, desi people, don’t change our loyalty.
I will come to pick you
after your class ends.
And now stop it, please. Please.
Don’t argue, man.
Ever since I entered this house,
I am very sad.
All these people are enjoying on my dollars.
These people have made such big property.
Anyway,
I have also decided.
Until I transfer all this property to my name,
I will not come back.
This task is very difficult,
but I am also very stubborn.
Aunt,
you are very innocent.
That I am.
But here, everyone is very clever.
I know they will not let
this task be completed this easily.
I do have one way out,
through which you
will easily get all the property.
You just need to cast your magic.
Yes, I know
what way you are trying to tell me.
I have also seen the advertisements here
for mystic man and spiritual sister.
But I don’t have experience with them here.
What if the effect of their magic spell goes wrong way?
And I lose this property.
Aunt,
you don’t need to go to the magicians for this.
You can cast the spell yourself.
Me? How?
Aunt,
change your style.
If you will fight,
they all will fight with you altogether.
If you listen to me, be sweet.
Talk with love to all the elders and youngsters.
Hey, honey. This is very difficult.
Think of something else apart from this.
Hmm. You must try.
Then see how you will get the property.
You can control them this way.
Haven’t you heard of this?
Soft words bring victory.
Hmm.
You are right at saying this.
This is the war I should win.
I have taken the decision.
Ever since I came to this house,
I feel like having
my name plate in front of this house.
Begum Sweetie, daughter Chaudhary.
So, that’s it.
Apply my formula.
Everything will be set.
Dabeer’s scoundrel son is here.
Aunt, what did I just explain to you?
Okay, okay, fine. I understood.
Now just see my acting.
Bye.
I hope this works on her.
Here comes my cuddly son.
Welcome home sweet home.
What happened to her?
Seems like she caught heat in this summer.
She has got dementia.
Dementia? What is it?
Britishers left and left you behind.
I mean heat has affected her brain,
and it has stopped working.
The brain swells. Don’t you know this?
You are right.
And seems like the attack is very severe.
Look, look, look.
How constantly she is smiling?
Hmm. Handle her.
Let me go grab ice from the fridge.
Yes, good idea.
Mother? My beautiful mother,
my… My… My mother?
I have one request for you.
What request do you want to make? Yes?
You must be here to put forward
your fatso’s recommendations, right?
I am telling you.
I will not accept any of her recommendations. Yes.
No, no. It’s not a recommendation, mother.
I just wanted to tell you that
sweetie is not bad, mother. She is very kind at heart.
She just gets furious a bit.
Don’t you dare take her side in front of me.
I will kick you both out of this house and
will confiscate your passports.
I think you have forgotten my anger.
No, mother. I have not forgotten it.
I still have the mark on my back and
can still feel the pain till today.
Mother, I am just trying to tell you,
that what I used to tell you all the time that
the huge superstore I have in the US,
it’s actually Sweetie’s.
Sweetie is also mentioning it again and again,
right?
It… It is not ours.
What nonsense are you uttering?
Yes? Say it openly.
Mother, I am telling you openly.
You are not listening to me.
Listen to me calmy, mother. Mother,
what I am trying to say is,
that sweetie has four brothers.
She has three sisters.
Those seven people also have
a share in that superstore.
Me and Sweetie are not the sole owners.
Yes, mother. I am telling you the truth.
We both spouses live in a small cage.
When sweetie came here
and saw this house,
so, mother. She got this mental disorder.
So, should I tell you what to do?
Take your oldie to America,
then get her brain’s treatment done.
Even if I die,
I will not transfer this house
to Sweetie’s name.
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.
When am I asking you to transfer this house to her name, mother?
Just listen to me calmy.
My beautiful mother, what I am saying is,
put her name plate in front of the house.
She will be happy for a while.
You are making my blood pressure high.
Sorry, mother. Sorry, mother.
Mother? Sorry.
So… Don’t know even if there are tablets for
the high blood pressure at home or not?
Oh, mother?
What is the matter, Bebo?
You are very sad ever since you
came back from Lahore.
Seeing your loved one after so long and
then leaving them behind,
it does make one sad, right?
You just went to meet Rania, right?
You are even sad after coming back.
That is why I didn’t go to meet her.
Once I would have hugged her,
then I wouldn’t leave her.
My heart doesn’t agree.
Hey, Bebo?
Shall I tell you one thing?
We have got such a nice proposal for you.
Boy is from America.
He got married there to a white then
couldn’t settle down.
So, that’s it.
He wants to marry in Pakistan…
Pakistan, what?
He wants to have another experience in Pakistan?
That it will be okay if it works.
Goodbye otherwise.
Sister-in-law, listen to me.
I am not fond of marrying for an experience.
No matter how I am,
I am very happy in my life.
What happened to her?
She was not this rude.
Let me call Rania and ask her.
What problems occur there?
Greetings, mother.
Dabeer, am I dreaming?
Don’t know, mother. How can I know?
Take a pinch out of mother.
Yes.
Look. No, no, it’s a reality. It’s a reality.
I am the one who woke up from the sleep,
mother.
I am very sorry.
I know I was so over.
But I apologize to you.
Now I will show you being a good daughter-in-law.
It will not happen next time.
I am ashamed of my rudeness.
Rania, put my recommendation.
Recommendation?
I can’t understand anything myself.
Mother,
in my village,
such people are taken to the spiritual man.
He brings the jinn out of people.
And his way is a bit different.
He beats the people with the broom with twigs.
But even if the jinn is foreigner,
it surely runs away.
No, no. Sweetie can’t catch a jinn.
They fear Sweetie themselves.
They die out of fear.
Sweetie, you are joking, right?
I know you are joking.
By the way, your jokes are so weird.
Right?
No joke. No lies.
I am very serious.
But why are you serious?
Your tone has changed suddenly.
I just made a mistake.
Dabeer, tell mother?
That Sweetie has such sweet nature.
Really?
This is breaking news.
This is breaking news.
Well, let’s do one thing.
Note me for some days.
Look for 10 to 15 days.
Then you will scream and
will tell the whole world yourself,
that my sweetie is the best
daughter-in-law in the whole world.
And then you
will make me your heir yourself.
Dabeer,
what do you say jaannasheen in English?
Oh, I don’t know.
I cannot understand anything.
My brain has gone numb.
Neither I understand Urdu, nor English.
I am just amazed.
Mother, pinch me, am I dreaming?
Have you become the cannibal? Yes?
You took a bit out of my beloved son?
Yes?
Mother, no matter how I am,
I am your sweet daughter-in-law, Sweetie.
Have you seen a clock going anti-clockwise?
No.
They go forward, not backwards.
Life also goes forward towards its end.
Don’t worry.
Miyan Jee will be fine.
God will do good.
Miyan Jee never talked about
such things ever before, Bebo.
My heart is pounding.
My courage and strengths are diminishing.
Sister-in-law,
you have always been this timid.
Atleast learn something from your daughter.
Nothing will happen to Miyan Jee.
My heart says so.
And we will make
Miyan Jee pay a visit to a big renowned doctor.
Everything will be fine.
No doctor has the treatment for Miyan Jee,
Bebo.
Miyan Jee’s son has his treatment.
Sadness of being away from
his son is eating him within.
He is his strength.
But Miyan Jee,
is unable to forgive him because of us.
Everything will be fine.
You didn’t go today? Is it your day off?
No. I just have one class.
It will start at 12.
What will I do after going so early?
I will go comfortably.
Fine.
I will do one thing. Let me ask brother Maheer.
He will drop you.
Leave your brother Maheer.
I don’t want him to take the car from
his stepmother giving her my excuse.
Besides, I have already taken the
bike keys from uncle Hammad.
By the way, poor brother Maheer
is facing so much oppression.
Not that much oppression.
You don’t know
yet what stepmothers do to the children.
Aunt Sweetie is still lenient.
Ask him to endure.
Are you being too rude to my brother?
No.
Your brother is not that much important to me.
That I will be rude to him
or offended with him.
Anyway, leave.
You tell me.
Did you meet my brother?
Did he come to jog today?
Yes. He comes every day to jog.
But Rania, honestly speaking,
I can’t wake up early in the morning.
Man, I can’t wake up. What to do?
By the way, I repent.
Girls nowadays are so ungrateful.
You are getting such a loving life-partner and
you are not done with your tantrums.
No, it’s not about being ungrateful.
I am just a bit lazy.
Now what to do?
I will get a little influenced by
uncle Hammad, right?
If Miya Jee gets a good treatment in the city,
then he will be fine.
Sister-in-law was right.
To kick brother out of his life,
the way Miyan Jee was gone stone hearted,
it’s so heavy today,
that it is not letting Miyan Jee breathe.
I will have to call brother.
I was keen to move forward.
If my father got me higher education,
then it was just
because I could become a good human being.
But I was crazy to become rich.
My first job,
was just giving me a few thousand
which was too low for me.
My heart was so sad.
But my moderation-lover father was so happy.
Whereas I thought that
if I would get a chance to have a shortcut,
I will definitely not lose that chance.
After my wedding,
I left my wife with my father and sister,
I came back to the city,
when accidentally and coincidentally,
my boss’ daughter came into my life.
Now she was a divorcee woman.
She was older than me.
But I knew.
that if she comes into my life,
then I will get everything I would wish for.
I forgot my wife during those days.
I forgot her completely.
Hmm.
You didn’t… You didn’t think
of your daughter while doing all of this?
I didn’t even see her face.
Then I left all of them
and married Yusra and
moved to another country.
And now…
After so many years…
I am feeling that loss.
I am knocking those closed doors,
that are closed on me forever.
Do you know?
Girls without their fathers,
how do those girls survive
without their fatherly love and shelter?
No matter how complete they are,
they do get something missing in them.
I did make a mistake.
I made a huge mistake. And…
And I want to fix that mistake.
I want to hug my daughter.
I want to take the burden off of
my weak father.
But…
But…
Those people are used to living without me.
No matter if I am there or not,
it doesn’t matter at all.
This… This can’t be true.
This can’t be true at all.
Your place must be empty till today.
Your family must be waiting for you.
You must be a bit late in going back but…
But… But this is possible. You…
Don’t lose hope, uncle.
Keep on knocking the closed doors.
One day, the doors will be opened.
Your daughter is so lucky.
That her father is alive.
And now he is about to meet her.
With God will.
My…
My father cannot meet me.
But your family will not be offended
with you for so long.
If they will be, let me know,
I will go with you.
I will talk to them and will make them
understand that they should forgive you.
And they will forgive you.
Thanks a lot, daughter.
Thank you so much.
You gave me courage.
You showed me a ray of hope.
Otherwise, I was really disappointed.
When someone loses hopes,
my job starts from there. Yes?
Well, uncle. I will go now.
I am getting late. Yes.
Come, please.
Where are you going?
You just came. Please sit.
No, I am already late.
Mother must be waiting.
I told her that I am going for a while.
Okay.
Let me drop you.
How will you go alone? Come on.
I didn’t come alone.
I came with sister Anjum.
Don’t know where did
she go in the kitchen?
She was saying that
she was cooking chanmbeli koftay.
She should have been done by now.
Not chanmbeli, nargisi koftay.
Oh, okay, okay.
The same, the same.
What are you looking at, doctor?
Please call her. I am getting late.
Oh, yes. Let me go call her.
Faster, please.
Come.
Bebo?
What is the matter?
Whom are you calling?
All good?
Just like that…
All good, you sure? Hmm.
Mother?
What do you want me to cook today?
Tell me?
I know you consider me dumb.
But I am not that dumb.
Whatever you will ask me,
as per your instructions, all the lentils,
vegetables, I will cook them all.
You just tell me. What do you want to eat?
Oh. Then you have come at the right time.
Because the one who cooks food
has taken her day off today.
Then you do one thing,
don’t look after, cook food yourself today.
Make karahi chicken.
Yes? Yes. Karahi chicken would work.
Chicken karahi?
What the hell?
Honey,
what problem did you make me stuck to?
Hey, mother?
Why are you sitting alone?
Yes? And Rania has not come yet too.
Where are our family members?
What is wrong with you?
Why are you getting worried?
Mother?
You are saying so as
if don’t know what I asked you.
Besides, it was nothing to be offended at.
It is to be offended at.
My daughter-in-law has come and is cooking.
And you don’t care at all.
I do care a lot.
But I am compelled.
Children have got so much homework.
And their tests are starting.
I am teaching them.
Come on,
you both go and cook food together.
Yes. For sure, mother.
You go to the kitchen.
I will join you after doing two to
three petty tasks.
Yes? Okay.
Tipu?
Mano?
This boy is wonderful too like this house.
He just has one bad thing.
He is my stepson.
But the property is in his possession.
If I somehow control
this boy along with this house,
then my honey’s future will be secured too.
Hmm…
This will turn out to be second
Dabeer for our family.
Stop, stop the bike.
What ill-manners are these?
Why have you come at front?
If you are so fond of dying then
go stand in front of some trucks.
And those trucks with their breaks failed.
Shut up, Rania.
Do you know what time is it?
Your university was closed long ago.
Where have you been?
How are you talking to me?
I won’t come under anyone’s pressure.
Understood?
I know.
Answer my question.
Where were you?
At Dr. Wasiq’s place.
Okay? Now take a side. Why?
Why did you go to that doctor’s place?
What storm occurred as such?
Why should I tell you?
Why did I go? What is your problem?
You live in our house.
You are our responsibility.
We are answerable to your mother
and Miyan Jee.
Otherwise, I am not fond of guarding you.
Fine.
I was late for real today.
I will not be late next time.
One second.
You will go to that
Dr. Wasiq’s house again?
What is your problem?
Me coming late or me going to
Dr. Wasiq’s place?
Why don’t you mind your own business?
Yes?
Anyway, whatever it is.
I don’t want to argue at this time.
I am tired. Okay?
I am going. I am worried for you for so long.
I am walking here and there.
Don’t you care at all?
Did I ask you to be worried or to wait?
I was talking about mother.
Okay. Then let me go talk to mother.
And for your information,
I informed mother before going.
Listen?
I was the one worried for you.
I was the one walking here and there.
And you will justify in front of grandmother?
What problem do you have with me, Rania?
Why do you go alone everywhere?
You could have told me.
I would have taken you
to that scoundrel myself.
What are you saying?
You called that innocent man a scoundrel?
You point of flaws in everyone, right?
You find flaws in everyone but yourself.
Change yourself.
Fix yourself.
This American mother who is being sent here,
she has been imposed on you like hell.
She will fix you.
Why are you being hyper
if I said something about Wasiq?
Not just Wasiq. Dr. Wasiq.
Address him with respect.
And yes.
I am going hyper.
So, be careful next time.
And stop considering me your responsibility.
Thanks to God,
my guardians are alive.
I would have been shifted to a hostel long ago
if mother didn’t swear on her love for me.
