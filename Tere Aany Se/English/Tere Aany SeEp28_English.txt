Bebo.
Father's condition isn't getting
any better,
doctor has written more tests,
how will we manage all that?
Everything will be managed
sister-in-law,
don't worry.
I was thinking
the money uncle put aside
for Rania's wedding,
we should use it for his treatment,
we will save again.
We only have to convince him
to move to Lahore,
and Bebo you have to help me with it,
I can't do it alone.
Rania is calling.
Sister-in-law, don't tell her anything
about father's condition,
she will get worried and
father won't like it either.
Better.
Hello, my child, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you all?
And where is grandfather?
What is he doing,
he's not answering my calls.
Father fell asleep a while ago,
did you see the time,
it's not the time to be awake.
Bebo and I were having a conversation
but why didn't you sleep yet?
I was about to sleep,
actually mother I wanted
to talk about something.
Yes, yes my child tell me,
everything alright?
I'm thinking to shift at a hostel
instead of grandmother's house.
At a hostel? Why is that?
Actually, I cannot study here,
there is a lot of disturbance
and always some noise,
that's why I thought I should move to a hostel,
I'll study with dedication.
Ms. Disturbance,
the ones who want to study can
study under the streetlights,
they don't get disturbed,
and they manage everything.
You're not a daughter of an elite man,
you're the granddaughter of
an old weak man,
who's fighting so many conditions
just to fulfil your dream.
I knew you'll never approve,
I'll talk to grandfather on my own.
Don't you dare Rani,
that you talk to uncle,
I won't spare you.
If there is that much disturbance that
you can't study, then damn it and come back.
Get the thoughts of higher education
out of your mind.
Mother what are you talking about?
I am absolutely right Rani,
uncle does not have enough strength anymore
to waste money on you, you need to understand.
Mother is everything alright?
Yes, yes, everything is alright,
you just made me angry with these
stupid thoughts of yours.
Look Rani, your mother
is absolutely right,
look, running away from
your problems is not bravery,
you need to face the challenges,
that's courage.
And when you talk about going to the hostel
earlier grandmother didn't like it,
if you mention it again
she will get offended.
That's why you should live in their house
and only focus on your studies
and ignore everything else.
But Bebo,
I don't think I will be able
to stay here for long.
Look Rani, don't be so stubborn.
Look Rani, if you cannot manage everything
then leave it and come back.
End it all.
Mother.
Come on, hurry up, I can't even have
my breakfast comfortably because of you.
Fast.
Seema listen to me I am going
to drop them off,
make hot and fresh flatbread and
omelette for when I will return.
So I could have breakfast properly.
Okay?
Hammad, it won't make it any better,
even if you have breakfast 4 times,
you won't be comfortable.
Why?
Oh come on, come on, we're getting late,
get your bag, bag, bag.
You didn't brush your hair?
Oh they're brushed, come on.
Say bye, bye.
Bye children.
Sweetie, where is Dabeer?
Tell him to come and have breakfast.
Mother, he's asleep.
He got up early the last 2-3 days
because of you all,
and now he's back to his routine.
Grandmother, I have to raise
an objection to you.
Yes, tell me, what happened?
Grandmother, does my future fiancé,
this darling Khawar,
does he have no respect
in this house?
Yesterday Mahir, called him
names. Why?
Good thing you reminded me
I also wanted to tell you,
something grandmother, last night
a group of snakes came to me.
They were really offended
by Mahir's comment,
they recorded a proper protest.
Have some shame,
he's our son-in-law.
Respect him, it's true
that he's a good kid.
And Mona, don't be so emotional,
he also means something to them
and they have a right to joke with him.
And listen, in a few days,
you will be saying Mahir and
Rania were absolutely right,
he's indeed a snake.
Grandmother, did you hear that?
Have your breakfast quietly,
don't speak anything.
Okay grandmother,
I'm leaving, I'm getting late.
Then I'll drop you, let's go.
No, there is no need for that.
What? How will you go?
I am going just there, it will be in my route,
I will drop you.
Grandmother,
say something, tell her.
You should go with him, he'll drop you,
he has to take the same route,
why would you suffer in public bus.
Okay,
I'll get the bag.
Okay I'll wait outside.
There is a limit to everything,
this girl that has been living in this house
and eating for free,
I really dislike her.
Who are you talking about?
Who?
When you sit there being all clueless,
I hate it.
I am talking about Rania,
why does she have a spacious
well-furnished bedroom?
She roams around this house
like she's the future owner.
Oh, her, she's only here
to complete her studies,
her grandfather is mother's first cousin,
and they both love each other
like real siblings.
Well there is something Sweetie,
you've been forgetting our customs and traditions
from here since you've been living in America.
Our elders have a lot of love,
they maintain their relationships.
These sympathies of yours,
have you ever thought?
How many useless people
do you have in your house?
Your brother, who runs away from work
as a doctor has prescribed against it.
And your sister-in-law's
ill-minded sister Mona,
and then your niece Rabail.
Why do all of them stay in this house?
She's my deceased sister's daughter,
mother's real granddaughter.
Okay I accept that she's your niece,
but that Rania?
She doesn't have any right over is,
she's eating for free here.
Sweetie, I just told you,
she is mother's brother's granddaughter,
she's an innocent girl,
what harm is she causing you?
Let her stay here.
All these useless people
are causing me harm,
they're being fed on our dollars,
and I think she came up with a plan
to seize all this property.
Seize the property? Whose?
My property, who’s else?
Sweetie,
your property is out there in America,
and to go there,
we can’t even get visa to go there.
How can Rania go there and
seize your property?
Everything here,
this is also mine.
I'm only giving respect to your mother
because Honey asked me to.
You know I feel disgraced
to respect others.
Yes, yes, that I know,
that I know.
So now, kick all these useless people
out of this house
or I'll have to do something on my own.
I explained it to aunt
and she is still behaving like this?
Convince her, convince her Honey,
convince her.
You know as fat as she is,
her mind is even more dense.
She does not understand
if you only tell her once.
My child, for God's sake,
please convince her.
If she stays here 2-4 more days,
she will destroy all the love
of our family.
Honey, do something,
and to get property in her name
she has been playing with the whole family.
Uncle, don't worry,
I'll come to Pakistan very soon,
and I'll fix everything
as soon as I arrive.
Oh, thank you Honey, my child.
You lifted 250g weight off my chest
by giving this news.
You don't have to let it
weigh you down,
you did all the hard work on the store,
I know all this property belongs to you,
your mother and your son.
Aunt doesn't have any right over it.
Honey my child, Honey, listen, come soon,
I'd say take a flight and get here right now
so we could end this argument.
I will.
Okay bye, bye Honey, bye.
Thank you, God.
Honey my child,
nobody can reason with that
arrogant woman except you.
Mona got it made specially.
Greetings Aunt.
Oh you, how are you.
Exactly how he looks like, right?
Look at him, pure gold buttons
on branded shalwar-kameez,
doesn't he look like
shiney-happy Khawar.
Brother Hammad,
where are you going, greet him
look who's here.
He saw that's why
he was going back.
How are you brother Khawar?
It seems like you have shopped for expensive
things again that's why you are here to show it.
Only the one who has the money,
shows off, right?
That's absolutely true,
poor Rania is an orphan
and her grandfather is only headmaster,
oh, retired headmaster.
And also she used to live in a village?
It’s about a person's capabilities aunt,
even if I had the money
I'd still won't show off.
Actually my grandfather taught me,
only the empty pots
make the most noise,
the people who're empty are the ones
who show off.
Brother Khawar, you came alone?
You should've brought
along sister as well.
Hey Rabail, did you forget?
Only one person uses a car
at a time at their place.
Hey brother Khawar, you didn't
tell all this to aunt Sweetie?
She gets really impressed
by such things.
In the past, uncle Rafique asked
for some money from grandmother,
they had some problem
so grandmother helped.
So if you want you can claim
that money as well
because father sent the money to grandmother
which means they were yours,
so if you want you can do this.
Shut up Mahir, behave yourself.
What did I say? Instead,
I spoke in your favor.
I know very well
why you are so jealous,
I'm not stupid or crazy to get mad
about all these comments.
How am I stuck in this bullfighting?
I'll leave, I'll leave.
Sit.
Brother Khawar leave
after you have the tea,
it's a tradition that we don't let
the guests go without having anything.
And who am I to think of you as a
stupid arrogant and stubborn?
You're so smart
that since you got here you ruined
the whole management of this house.
Yes,
the environment of this house
did change for you,
earlier you used to roam around
in the car now you're on a bike.
Earlier you used to shop often
now you are dependent for money.
The environment did change
since I got here.
Your thinking is severely wrong,
wealth and money do not have
an importance in human life,
I am talking about respect,
relationships and love that
you can never understand.
Rania and Rabail, let's go,
we don't have anything to do here.
Yes, let's go.
You sit.
Brother leave
after you have the tea,
it's a tradition that we don't let
the guests go without having anything.
Drink the tea then leave.
Darling, tea?
No.
I have been lenient
for too long now
I think I have to take a strict action.
Dabeer, Dabeer.
Tea.
Your customs can go to hell,
that Mahir only broke my button yet,
he'll come back and break me.
I'm leaving.
Stop, Khawar, listen to me.
Mona, pass the chocolate biscuits.
Yes, but.
Very bad, very bad,
you misbehaved a lot with Sweetie.
It's okay if she's a step-parent
but she's your mother.
Stop this father,
you've done really bad to me,
you've been in America for so long
and you didn't even earn a penny?
You were the slave of that
aunt Sweetie your whole life?
I used to ask for money
because you're my father
and a son has all the rights
over father's earnings.
Little did I know,
you used to send me all the dollars
taking from her.
What will happen to my life?
I've spent such a luxury life
and now what she's doing with me.
She leaves me no good,
what am I going to tell people.
Enough? Are you done talking?
It's fine that store was her,
she owned it
but my son I worked hard
my whole life,
I did all the labor.
Physically,
physically it was my hard work.
There is a limit, I used to send
my hard earned money.
Son we need to use politics,
we should try to befriend her,
it's okay that she's a little difficult
but we have to be smart, right?
Just a little difficult?
Yes.
Father,
what she's doing with Rania,
how she insults her every now and then,
that doesn't mean anything.
So, all the problems
you have against Sweetie,
you're doing this because of Rania?
Tell me one thing,
do you have a soft spot
in your heart for Rania?
No uncle, there is nothing like that,
I am here for a very noble cause,
I need to complete my studies.
I can't think anything like that from Mahir,
please take this misunderstanding
out of our mind.
You're saying right, it's true?
Then the problem is solved,
there is nothing to worry about.
Don't worry both of you,
go and take rest.
Just give me this and
take away the tray.
I'm understanding everything,
why he's having
so many sympathies
but I won't fall for that.
How fast she replied that
there is nothing between us.
Why didn't you tell father
the whole thing?
What thing?
That, you're the future
prime minister of Pakistan.
I'd say you should add me
in your party,
I'll chant so loud,
I'll run such campaigns
that no matter people vote for you
or not they'll definitely give you love.
Will you include?
God's forgiveness,
I mistakenly told you one thing
and you picked it.
Obviously, if it’s something
like this I'll have to hold it.
Hey, tell me the name of the party.
Your head.
My head?
Yes sir, it was Sunday
so I thought I can work for a few hours,
yes sir, just that
I don't like being at home,
I'm getting so used to of office that
I wanted some today as well.
What? You were sleeping?
Okay, sorry, sir sorry.
Hello?
Actually, they can't run
the office without me.
Wow, uncle has been
really happy lately.
Yes, and all the credit goes to you.
What did I do?
I only motivated him,
uncle did the rest on his own.
You're absolutely right.
Uncle has been really fit lately,
they talk daily,
this damned love is something like this,
and it changes the human.
I think, before Farhad,
I will be married,
actually she only gave
a hint to send proposal.
Really?
That's a really good news uncle.
But there is a problem,
you have to play a double role here.
I mean you have to talk to sister as well
so that she could take my proposal
and then you have to talk to
grandfather as well
to approve of my proposal.
Actually my sister,
expect a no from her 98%,
she's not agreeing,
and I've heard grandfather
let his dogs loose,
if someone asks for his family member
in marriage.
No there is nothing like this,
it's all a lie.
You don't have to worry,
I do this happily.
Okay then it's fine,
you should talk to mother happily
and already mother doesn't say
no to you.
Grandfather won't say no either,
I'll do this, today I'll call him
and talk to him, okay?
This aunt Seema was taunting my Bebo,
now she'll see my Bebo's groom,
then see how surprised she'll be.
My uncle doesn't even
know how to blush,
how many things
do I have to teach you?
Oh don't worry,
I'll teach him how to blush,
but you should please
talk to grandfather, please.
Yes okay,
they'll I'll go like this and return like this,
then we'll talk to your mother too.
Thank you.
Thank you.
She's a wonderful girl,
I became her fan, well-done.
It's good to blush but I'll help you
practice how to blush.
Should I do.
Shehenshah, pour more juice,
come on,
let’s drink the juice,
the whole glass.
Oh my God.
Take the whole glass.
Hey Sweetie,
it's enough now I'm tired,
we'll do the rest tomorrow.
No, no, no, we'll have
to do everything today,
won't leave anything for tomorrow.
What have you done to my lawn,
well understandable,
who cares about someone else’s property?
Now that I am here I will protect
my lawn and my house on my own.
Okay, this pot, the heavy one,
quickly put it away.
Sweetie, it's a really heavy pot,
hey come here Shehenshah,
what are you doing sitting there?
Come here with me.
You dare say something
to Shahenshah again I like this,
use your child labor get your
passport cancelled.
Don't you feel ashamed,
asking such a young boy to do all this,
heavy lifting?
You're always saying something to me.
Listen to me,
these two of your relatives
that are passing from here,
call them here and ask them
to move the pots, come on, fast.
Sweetie, you're wonderful,
she's such a skinny girl,
soft and delicate,
will they be able to lift these?
That's the only way I have to
kick them all out of here.
You want all of us to run away from here,
but I won't let this happen.
Take this strawberry, this one,
look how red it is, eat this.
Father,
father.
Rania.
Hello, Rani, how are you?
Leave me, tell me
where is grandfather,
his phone is off whenever I call him,
I have to talk to him but something
very important, let me talk to him.
Rani, father is.
Do you know what I am going
to talk to him about?
About your and
uncle Ayaz's relationship.
Also he will ask for your opinion,
don't waste time in getting shy
just straight away tell him
he's one in a million,
I will take care of your rest, okay?
Get him on the phone.
Rani, father went
to check on his land,
he probably didn't have networks there.
You can call later
Oh,
okay what can we do,
if it's a delay from God's side.
Well you must have mentioned
uncle Ayaz with mother,
what was her reaction?
Rani I am busy at the moment,
can we talk later? Bye
Bye? Hello?
What's going on?
Why are they distracting me?
Oh my God,
did she change her mind?
Hello?
Hello?
I'm Asma speaking.
Asma?
Asma how are you my child?
Is everything alright?
Can you come home
at this time brother?
Father’s condition is really bad.
He is in need of your support,
you should come and
take away his pain.
Give peace to his weak existence.
Complete your obligation.
Father is sick?
I’m coming Asma, I am just leaving,
you take care of him.
Sister-in-law,
don’t call my decision wrong,
the father is getting really weak,
he is not able to fight this disease,
he is in need of support,
in need of a treatment.
I didn’t beg brother for anything,
neither had I asked for a favor,
I just reminded him of his duty.
And talked about the right
that father has over him,
all the complaints aside sister-in-law,
but at this moment
we all have to think about father.
Rani,
Rania is really emotional,
it won’t be easy for her
to accept all this.
Whether you forgive him
or not that is your choice,
I won’t force you for this.
How is father?
Come inside.
Father,
father.
Yes?
How are you father?
Father,
father please forgive me father.
If you won’t forgive me
God won’t forgive me either.
Yes, I’ve forgiven him,
you should also forgive him.
I know I am terrible,
I don’t deserve forgiveness
but
please do this favor to me.
I’ve protected your valuables
with all honesty,
saved them from the scorching sun
with the whole existence of mine.
But now I’m tired,
broken,
your valuables are
your responsibility now.
Grandmother,
give me a head massage.
Mother’s sacrifice,
oil massage? Go get it.
Why do we bring it,
I’ll ask Shehenshah.
Shehenshah.
Listen to me, if you live and
this place then do some work.
Work?
I don’t a habit of working.
Now you’ll ask me to iron the clothes,
I’ll burn them,
ask me to dust, something will break.
Yes, if you ask me to cook
then you’ll have to starve,
but it’ll be a good diet for you.
You are talking as if you are
daughter of a landlord.
Mother, I’ve decided today
onwards except Shehenshah,
all the extra chores will be done by her,
Mona and Rabail.
And that Seema,
she’s idle all day,
she’ll do all the work
in the kitchen.
I was doing all the chores
for so many days,
now I have decided
this is going to happen.
You made this decision.
Yes I’ll decide, who else would?
These decisions of yours will be
implied at your home,
this house is mine
I will make all the decisions.
Servants, I’m thinking
we should get one or two more,
what do you think?
There is a need.
It’s such a big house.
You have gone mad mother-in-law.
Oh I’ll die, what are you saying sister?
Don’t do this, she’ll slap you across
the face so bad in anger
that you’ll have to treat it for 4 days.
I am speaking from experience,
well I would say mother let’s have,
this be the lion.
House belongs to the one who paid for it.
No, I mean house belongs to the one
who has the documents in their name.
I’m just like this, this house
will go to my son Mahir.
What?
Yes.
Dabeer.
Listen.
Dabeer.
Listen, from where did uncle Dabeer
come in this situation?
That poor man gets in trouble
for everything.
Doesn’t get it without any reason,
he was the one who brought her here.
I thought she got better but
she lost her mind again.
Dabeer,
Dabeer.
Ms. Making decisions here,
I have also decided now I will act like
a Queen instead of mother-in-law.
Wow, It’ll be fun.
And listen, come here,
she also needs a treatment terribly.
What happened mother,
what did I do?
What did you do?
You became so diplomatic,
here for a moment and
there the next moment.
You became a spoon.
And go call your useless husband,
both of you are taking
advantage of my leniency.
Okay mother.
Wow mother, it was amazing,
what Punjabi movie did you watch
before falling asleep last night?
I don’t need to watch any Punjabi movie,
I myself am a film.
I want to scold everyone
to show Sweetie,
so she won’t take me lightly.
I’m a very difficult woman.
What a wonder you are,
I thought you lost the presidency
of this house from your hands
but I was wrong.
Oh my grandmother.
Listen to me call Dabeer,
I’ll give him a dose as well
he also needs that,
You’re absolutely right,
I will call him right now.
Yes.
Mother, Hammad is sleeping.
What time is this to sleep?
Go wake him up,
if she doesn’t wake up then
pour a jug of water on him.
Bucket.
And your Mona,
if I see her wandering somewhere
wearing makeup I’ll kick her,
tell her kid’s study is
her responsibility today.
Mother my kids will fail.
Let them be.
And Rania you.
Yes.
You came here to study,
I’ve never seen you studying,
today onwards whenever I see you,
you must have a book in your hand.
Yes mother.
Yes Salik I do have some money.
and that’s what I’ve thought
I’ll invest them somewhere
and then I’ll run the house
with the profit I get.
Brother, you need experience
for business.
You’ll waste what you’re left with.
I have to take the risk dude,
I also have some dignity,
I can’t get insulted by
Mrs. Dabeer daily over dollars.
You had an attitude over this wealth,
you were so arrogant,
and you made fun of me
and even had a bet on me.
Maybe nature taught you a lesson.
Dude,
the advices are right but
we have to do something now.
I can’t take this anymore.
But I can’t be happy
about your situation,
my grandfather didn’t teach me
to smile on someone’s pain,
I still have sympathies for you.
I’ll help you.
I’ll talk to them, okay? Relax.
Okay.
Hey, Rania, wait.
Salik I’ll call you later.
Have a seat,
I need to talk to you.
Speak.
I was going to say,
Rania please help me,
get some idea or some remedy,
how do we tackle Mrs. Dabeer?
She’s in tolerable.
She insults me every now and then.
Now everyone can’t function according
to your choice, your likes and dislikes,
so it’s better for you
to build tolerance.
I’ve tried to tolerate,
but I can’t,
and I think she’ll directly attack
on me now.
Then you should make yourself attack-proof
instead of focusing on her.
This matter isn’t as light
as you’re taking this,
she’s in hopes of excluding me
from my house
and I’ve heard it,
she was talking to some lawyer
so maybe legally or by going to a court,
she wants to seize this house, car and property.
So what?
You’ll live in a small house without
a car and without any facility.
There will be a problem,
how will you look at other people
like they’re inferior?
And how will you show off?
Hey, then you
and I will be equals,
that you won’t be able to process,
it’ll be a little difficult.
Your replies sound like you
disliked my comments,
Did I hurt you?
Forgive me dude.
I don’t get hurt over
small things like this,
actually I know some people are habitual
but if you can realize the ugliness
of your behavior then it’s a good thing.
Will you help me in this matter?
I’ll think about it.
You’ll still think about it?
I just apologized
What?
Zaman has returned?
And Anwar forgave him?
Grandmother,
actually father is really sick,
he needs a support in this condition.
And brother has taken all the
responsibilities since he came,
we’ve forgiven him.
But Rania,
she doesn’t even
know her father is alive,
and despite being alive he always
stayed away from her responsibilities.
I don’t know if she’ll be able to forgive him
when she finds out.
Look,
she’s a young blood,
it’ll be really difficult for her,
the matter has greatly escalated.
You just tell Rania that
father is really sick,
and she should come back
for a few days,
then when she’ll return
I’ll manage everything here.
My brother is sick then
how can I stay here?
I’ll bring Rania along with me, okay?
Okay, bye.
Okay, okay, bye, bye.
Mahir,
hey Mahir, listen to me.
Enough, enough,
why are you getting worried?
Asma called and she said your
grandfather is a lot better now,
if God wills he’ll be fine.
Enough my child.
That’s why grandfather
wasn’t answering my calls,
if Bebo or mother would’ve told me
earlier I’d be with grandfather by now.
Everything will be alright,
you’ll see,
your grandfather will be fine soon.
Both of us will go together,
she’ll get worried alone,
then do this,
take our bags to the car.
Okay grandmother.
In the car? I’ll need the car.
Say no, tell her no,
or I’ll say something to her by
leaving she’ll be dancing on one leg.
I’m going and I’ll make all the decisions
when I come back.
Sweetie, is it the time
to talk about all this?
Mother, go peacefully,
today I won’t play games
instead I’ll pray with my heart
for uncle’s health, you should go.
Yes.
Yes Rania, don’t worry,
you’ll see grandfather will be perfectly fine
