Here there is an allegation for theft,
there father is upset.
Not father, in fact, rich,
wealthy, educated papa.
Call him daddy. Call him papa.
Call him papa love.
Now calling him father is not reasonable.
It doesn’t suit his personality.
He is a rich man.
Rich. Man, I am dead.
Was that girl any less than any firework?
Now his papa entered the picture,
that too rich papa.
Now she will turn out to be a missile.
Hey, listen to me first.
Hold. Hold. Sister in law.
Sister in law. Sister in law.
All hell broke loose at your home.
An action film is taking place,
just the after shock is left.
Khaver, have you lost your mind?
What nonsense is this?
Who are you talking to?
Let me talk to them.
Hey, leave who I am talking to.
That Rania’s father somehow came
to life and he is rich and wealthy as well.
What? What are you saying?
Sister in law, I am right,
I have a great spy that lives in that home
and look at aunt Sweetie,
she put an allegation of dollar
theft on a rich man’s daughter,
meaning Rania and
she dragged her out of the home.
Dollar theft? Rich father?
Rich father’s daughter, Rania.
What else? Tell me the rest of the story.
I swear to God brother Zaman,
usually everyone in our
home used to love Rania,
but I have loved her like a mother.
Yes. I have failed all of
sister in law Sweetie’s moves.
I stood in front of Rania like a shield.
Stop it, it is enough. Stop. Stop.
No, no, uncle, aunt is absolutely right.
in fact, I am thankful to all of you.
You people have really
supported me in my tough times.
Brother, I always stand with
what is right and true.
By the way, you didn’t tell us,
why did you leave your second wife?
Hey.
No, I was just asking.
If you don’t want to tell me,
then there is no need.
Leave it now.
Shall we go Mahir. Shall we go home?
Do you too have a superstore in America?
No. No. Nothing like that.
Fine.
Come on Mahir, order a taxi, we will go.
Hey, what are you saying? I will drop you.
Thank you very much.
Hamad bring the bike home.
I will bring Tipu with mama.
I will go and check where Tipu is.
He is really mischievous.
This way I will get to see the home.
Come on, let’s go.
Grandma.
Grandma, you go home.
I wont come.
Why wont you come? It is your own home.
You are afraid of Sweetie. Let her play.
Please grandma, don’t insist.
I am already really angry
because of what Mrs. Dabeer has done
and if I go, then I wont care about that
Mrs. Dabeer, and nor will I be diplomatic.
I will say something wrong for no reason,
then dad will have a long face.
So it would be better grandma
that I don’t go to that home.
Rania,
I will come to meet you.
You take care of yourself.
Where did this rich father of Rania come from?
God, I am really confused.
Wherever he came from, sister, leave it.
Our mission was to have her sent out
of the home, so we did. End of story.
That is fine, but I find her rich father
coming in as some sort of drama.
If she was the daughter of such a rich father,
then why would she be looking for a job?
She would have called her father once,
her father would have showered her with money.
There is something wrong,
that I don’t understand.
Her father coming in suddenly
hasn’t put my revenge to rest.
Look, madam Sweetie,
listen to me really carefully. Okay?
I am really worried for you.
The haste you have shown putting this allegation
of theft, these people will not tolerate it.
And I feel that Rania’s father
will also take revenge from you.
I feel that your bad days in Pakistan have started.
Before they do something,
I would suggest that you slowly pack
your bags and get ready to leave.
I will help you pack. Come on.
Listen, don’t do this overacting
of sympathy in front of me.
My name is Sweetie,
but I am really stubborn and bitter.
I have decided to be stubborn till
the time I don’t get this home in my name.
and that Mahir who has become
a supporter of that Rania,
he too will be mine.
I will get my Honey married to that Mahir.
Oh sister so this is your plan?
Look sister, make me your disciple,
you wont find a better follower than me.
No, the evil is my follower.
My aunt’s son comes to me.
No one can do this work better than me,
think about it.
Hey, I told you my entire plan.
Hear me clearly,
if you tell anyone my plan,
I will call the American embassy
and I will file a harassment case on you
and then you will go to jail. Understand?
Understand?
I wont tell anyone.
Hmmm.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Okay listen, get me a cup of coffee.
This 48 hour job takes a person’s life.
I am really tired.
In fact, bring me my coffee in my room.
I will just bring it.
Greetings.
Rania, you? When did you come?
Hey, after all,
she is my daughter,
so obviously she will come
to live with her father.
Why? Why are you so surprised?
Are you not happy?
No papa,
I am really happy to see him here.
Think that all my tiredness is gone.
I have become fresh.
I mean, that,
you too were worried cause of her,
now everything will be normal.
Yes.
What do you say, Rania?
Okay, then you go and change,
then we will all sit and eat together.
I am not hungry.
Why? What happened to you?
Papa, leave all this.
we will celebrate this.
Lets go to a good restaurant,
we will have dinner there
and we will celebrate this happiness there.
What do you say?
I like it. It is a great idea.
I don’t want to go anywhere.
Rania, please.
I am asking you.
after all, I have listened to you so much,
I have changed myself because you asked me.
I have started to laugh,
I have started to talk to people,
Wont you agree to something
so small from me? Please.
If you have changed thinking that
you will make deals with me, then please,
you become like you were earlier, damned.
I don’t care.
After all,
I didn’t come here because of any
reason that should be celebrated.
Fate is on a mission to make you meet me.
First my hospital, now my home,
and you will see that you will enter my life too.
And I am waiting for that moment desperately.
I am surprised to hear about your brother.
I mean, he made a filmy entry.
If this happens in dramas,
people ask a hundred questions.
But your brother has created a real
scene in real life. Real scene part.
You are still not aware of the real scene,
that is going to happen soon.
There is still something left to happen.
I am unable to digest that you are
a really rich man’s only sister.
Not accepting the reality only ruins a
person’s memory, it achieves nothing else.
Now what it is, it is.
And we will shift to the city really soon.
To your brother’s big home, right?
Obviously.
Okay, Mian Jee is calling me,
I will talk to you later, or maybe we will meet.
Goodbye.
I feel there is no line of marriage in my fate.
First I met a girl, then she became really rich,
and now the girl’s brother, what do I do?
What do I do?
Rania.
Rania will fix everything. Rania.
Ahem.
What new continent are
you planning on discovering?
Right now I am trying to discover myself.
I don’t understand what my real identity is.
The one that I was told
or the one that was hidden from me.
Rania, you are really smart.
Just understand this,
that at times a lot of truths need
to be hidden cause of the situation.
The lies that I was told to hide this truth,
it was not good.
Papa, loves you in fact all of you a lot.
If this was really true,
then you wouldn’t have had to bear witness
to this standing in front of his daughter.
Rania, even if you consider me a stranger,
but you can ask papa.
I don’t just call him papa,
but consider him papa too.
He is not just my late parents’ friend,
but also my family too now.
So please, you consider this home yours
and live here with all your right.
I didn’t come here for any right…
I didn’t come here to show my right,
in fact, I have been brought here out of helplessness.
I will buy a home my daughter likes for her.
You tell me,
when will you come to see a home with me?
Whatever you have done for me is enough.
There is no need to buy any home.
I too have your blood in my veins.
Who knows when I will leave
everything and run away?
Papa.
Papa, everything will be fine.
Why do you worry?
I know Rania well,
she cannot stay upset with anyone for long.
Please.
I am really surprised in this age,
and such pretty hair.
What do you mean in this age?
What is my age?
There in America everyone
considers me unmarried.
They must all be blind.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
In fact, I would say that you look so pretty,
when I get married,
you style your hair just like this.
You will look equally pretty.
All my friends will be there
in my marriage, and you?
You are the life of this family, respect,
pride, and God knows what all you are.
And sister Seema, she is nothing
in front of you, she is just plain.
Oh, I am dead.
What did you do with her hair?
I think there was a blind eagle and the poor thing
had an epilepsy attack while making her nest.
Stop. Stop. Leave it.
I know well that you are jealous of
sister in law Sweetie’s love and beauty.
And I know well, that you don’t like the love
between me and sister in law, Sweetie.
Not just your love, I don’t like you at all.
You look poisonous.
I don’t feel like calling you my sister.
Hey, you are like a nail.
Show-off, uptight, you still have no wealth and
look at you, how you have changed your face.
What does this mean?
Wealth hasn’t come, in fact,
wealth has already come.
Since I got engaged to Khaver darling,
precious gifts have come for me.
And if you don’t believe it,
then go survey my room, you will find out.
After all, smart people have said correctly,
a person should go around with
people their own standard.
What do you say Sweetie?
You are right.
Seema, I don’t know
where you have gone to today.
Go and make me tea.
I am tired.
Listen, whatever you are getting, get two.
And don’t add sugar in my tea,
because I am on a diet.
Oh, your existence is like a stone.
My whole body has been crushed.
Khaver. Khaver darling where are you?
Please lets go. Hospital.
I have told aunty clearly that after
I come to Pakistan, I will meet my family.
I will go to my uncle’s home,
and then I will come to meet her.
You did good.
You know everyone really misses you here.
Mahir, come here.
Honey, I will talk to you a little later. Okay?
My friend has come over to stay nowadays.
He is a little upset.
No, no worries, you give him time,
we will talk later. Bye.
Okay, bye, bye, bye.
What happened? Are you okay?
Yes, I am fine, man. I just have a headache.
You tell me, who were you talking to?
Honey, aunt’s daughter.
Actually aunt passed away in America a long time back,
but then her aunt adopted her.
But she hasn’t been able to forget
anyone from her mummy’s family.
She is coming here for a few days.
You tell me, how was your day?
How will it be?
The same as it passes daily.
With you coming to this home
has brought life to this home.
Seeing you here, I feel that
dreams are turning into reality.
What?
You used to dream of me in this home?
Why?
Now I don’t have any answer for this why.
Okay,
if your dreams really turn into reality,
then will you dream something for me.
Tell me,
what do you want to see in the dream?
You dream that Mahir is really rich,
all his worries are over.
And he has become a big businessman.
You really worry for Mahir,
you always think about him.
I will worry.
Right now the difficulties Mahir is in,
when you hear it,
you too will think about him all the time.
His step mother, aunt Sweetie…
Can we not talk about something else?
Yes.
You are right.
You shouldn’t mention aunty Sweetie,
it spoils the mood.
You tell me about yourself,
how long do you know him…papa?
This is something old.
Papa and my parents used
to be really good friends.
He was upset with his Mrs. behavior
he used to often come to our home.
Papa used to be really worried in those days
and he was also embarrassed.
If I tell you honestly,
he used to really miss all of you people.
He used to talk about you people.
During that time,
my mother passed away.
In that situation papa became
a really good friend of mine,
he became a partner in my sorrows,
he shared my sorrow.
That’s it, during that time,
my papa too went to my mama.
And papa became my real papa.
What happened?
Why did you get quiet?
Tell me more.
What do I tell you?
You didn’t tell me anything about yourself.
Papa tells me that your
grandfather brought you up.
Yes, my Mian Jee.
My Mian Jee,
brought me up with a lot of love,
attention and affection.
He will come in a few days,
you meet him.
You will really like it.
Yes.
You know, my Mian Jee has a really good heart
and he really likes smart and respecting people.
I am sure when you meet him,
you will become friends with him,
the same way Mahir has become his friend.
I pray to God that you too start liking me,
I make a home in your heart.
You take my name instead
of Mahir on everything.
I pray to God this happens.
You really miss Mahir?
I don’t miss him, but at times I think of him.
He is in so much difficulty.
And mama, Mahir’s grandma,
she is my Mian Jee’s sister.
So this way me
and Mahir are close relatives,
and you know, relatives have so much right.
Just that’s why.
This dress is for my Bebo.
It is really pretty.
and see, all these are for Rania.
She will like them, right?
Why wont she like them?
And my dress is really pretty.
Do you like it?
Where is yours?
I don’t need it Bebo.
Why don’t you need it?
You really need it,
and now you have to take care of yourself.
I have to take you to
Haar Singhar for a facial.
Idiot. When there was time,
I never got a facial done, and I go right now.
There is no time,
and when a person is young,
they are fresh and beautiful.
He doesn’t need these things.
So all this is for this age.
The time you spend alone in your life,
it is time for it to end is here.
Now you have to focus on yourself,
you have to take care of yourself.
Bebo,
everything seems fine on the outside.
Everything is normal.
But my heart doesn’t agree.
That man,
who kicked me out of his life,
the one who rejected me,
today he has come back,
so who will account for the days of my life
that I spent without him, when I needed him?
This thing doesn’t leave my heart.
Sister,
brother has made a big mistake,
but the issue is that it took him
a long time to realize his mistake.
But sister in law everything is good now,
Rania too has reached her father.
He also calls you daily.
He is calling us all to the city.
And have you not seen Mian Jee,
it feels he never had an ailment.
This is really true.
Mian Jee is really fresh,
like he was suffering from the sorrow of his son.
Okay, thank God,
he made the father meet his son.
If I tell you the truth, all this is fruit of your
patience that our family is connected again.
Everything is good.
Now you will see, we will make time pay for
all our present and past happiness.
That is true.
You know Bebo,
what is the name of the biggest happiness?
Uncle Ayaz.
Sister in law, at least now you
don’t call him uncle. Poor thing.
Okay see, how is it? It is good, right?
It is really pretty.
This colour purple is also really pretty.
Hey,
what happened?
Why did you suddenly come out here?
No, nothing, just like that.
I understand what is in your heart,
and I admit my fault too.
But I know admitting my mistake
I still cannot make amends for your loss.
Child, it is not in my hands to
bring back time that has happened,
but whatever happened with
you at aunt’s home that day,
I cannot forget it.
As much as I hold that woman responsible,
I consider myself equally responsible.
This home was made by Wasiq’s father.
Wasiq wanted to go abroad for his specialization,
he wanted to sell this home.
So I decided to buy this home.
But now I have decided that
I will put this home in your name.
In my name? Why?
There is no need for that.
I know Mian Jee didn’t bring you up like that.
You are not interested in wealth or money,
but what can we do child,
this society runs on its own rules.
The one who has property and
money is the one who gets respected.
I have spoken to Wasiq.
He is not ready to give me
this home by taking a payment.
But we will pay the complete price for it.
I am calling the lawyer for this tomorrow.
Please don’t buy it on my name.
Why? It will be in your name tomorrow.
After I die, it will all be in your name,
then why not today?
I will call the lawyer tomorrow, be ready.
Rania, child,
I have wasted a lot of my life,
now maybe I have little time.
Now if you don’t forgive this sinner father,
then I too don’t want this life.
Papa.
I forgive you.
Asma. Asma, tell me the date when you
are coming to Lahore, then you see my haste.
Imagine if you come today,
then I will bring my heart tomorrow.
I mean, tomorrow,
I will come with a proposal for you at your home.
Have you spoken to sister?
She will agree, right?
I will talk to sister?
Whatever I say is the rule of this home. Okay?
I take the decisions of this home.
What I say happens.
Without my will , nothing can be moved
in this home. It moved. It moved.
One minute, wait. Sister will kill me.
Yes, so you do one thing,
don’t worry, you just wait.
It is possible I come with a ring,
and it is also possible I bring a molvi,
I might surprise you.
No. No. No need to be so hasty.
First you pray that my family agrees as well.
Because only what Mian Jee
says happens in our home.
What he says, he says.
What are you saying Asma?
You had said everything is fine,
Mian Jee will agree.
Everyone at home is happy.
What sort of news are you giving me, Asma?
This is like saying no, in a way.
This means, if you look at it,
I don’t have marriage in my fate.
I am even dreaming of wedding choirs.
I had also chosen my wedding dress.
Asma, you say this is a lie.
You are lying, right? You are lying, right, Asma?
What is wrong?
I have only expressed one fear.
You know another interviewer
has been added to the list, brother.
So it is possible he will ask a difficult question,
so you prepare and come.
Okay? Goodbye.
Hey, how do I prepare?
Should I get my knives sharpened?
What do I do that her stubborn father
and rich brother agree.
What do I do? God what do I do?
Hey unfaithful girl, your madness.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop singing this song. Quiet.
What happened? Did you not like the song.
If you want, I can sing a song you like.
This is Zeeshan Ahmad’s song, by the way.
You know, by the way, you are the sort of
people who get happiness on a platter, for free.
How would you know the emotions of love?
If you have loved you would know.
Oh uncle, you have made this tragic face again.
Now you will see, you will think of something bad,
and surely something bad will happen with you.
Child, I am already almost dead.
Both you brother and sister scare me to death.
Hey, the news will run on Geo,
a single, twenty eight year old man
has been laid to rest after his funeral.
Because his hopes have been ruined.
His hopes have been ruined.
Uncle, what are you saying?
How do you get these bad thoughts in your head?
Brother, what does mama say?
An idle mind is a devil’s workshop,
so uncle is facing the same.
I will respond to this later.
I need your help Farhad.
Ask Rania to ask her father that the single,
good, decent and honest man
he is looking for his sister who is standing here,
look at him and think about him.
Man, you talk to her, things will workout,
something will happen.
Why does everyone make
me praise them falsely?
Look, you are making me put in a
good word even before the entrance.
I don’t know what his father
will ask me in the interview.
Will there be MCQs or not?
Don’t worry, I am telling you,
everything will be fine.
hey they wont ask you for the formula of making
an atom bomb, or how to take off a plane.
They wont ask you for such a technique.
You don’t worry, everything will be fine.
Really?
But you promise you will talk
to Rania about me, right?
Fine, okay.
I will ask Rabail to go to Rania
and talk to her. That’s it?
Yes. I don’t know what will happen.
Whether I will survive the interview or not.
Congratulations child,
this home is yours from today.
Congratulations Rania,
this home is really yours.
But I didn’t want all this.
But this is what fate wants.
Take it.
Thank you, papa.
Hey, what is there to thank me in this?
Mr. Mahir has come outside.
Mahir is here?
So why have you made him
stand outside? Bring him inside.
He is no stranger.
He is my mama’s real grandson. Call him.
I will just call him.
Mahir, how are you?
Fine.
How is this possible?
Someone who orders his pawns around
is away from them and he is happy too?
You are hiding something from me, right?
Fine, don’t tell me, I wont ask you either.
Greetings uncle.
Greetings.
How are you uncle? Are you fine?
Greetings.
Greetings.
Have a seat.
Sure.
Rania, get tea made, in fact also order sweets.
Sweets?
What for uncle?
I will tell you.
first you tell me about yourself.
Uncle,
I have decided to start my business.
Okay.
The investment is a little low,
but if I can get your guidance,
it would be better.
So what? Papa will give you a loan.
No. No. I don’t need a loan uncle,
I just needed your advice.
Look, first, don’t hesitate when talking to me.
After all, I am your uncle, not a stranger,
and Rania is right.
Your own help you.
I will surely help you.
By the way, you tell him your good news.
Yes, Mahir,
papa has bought this home from
Dr. Wasiq and put it in my name.
I told him not to,
but papa made everyone from mama
to Mian Jee put in a good word.
Bought it?
What do you mean?
He is your son.
You too thought the same just like me.
Earlier I too thought that
Dr. Wasiq is papa’s son.
Meaning, he is not your brother?
Hey, no, no, there is nothing like that.
Not at all.
Papa is my father’s friend,
but now he is my papa.
I will get sweets.
Mahir, all good?
