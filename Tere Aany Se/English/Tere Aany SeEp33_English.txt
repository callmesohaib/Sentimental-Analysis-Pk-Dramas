Mian Jee, I am really sad.
I want to come to you.
But my education.
Hey, don’t worry, we are coming to
you to the city. I spoke to Zaman.
Really? When?
You have made me really happy
giving me this news, Mian Jee.
When are you people coming?
I want that you come quickly
and I run and hug you.
Hey, I am coming to meet my daughter,
what else?
Oh God, today is really good.
I already had a feeling that
today would be good.
Okay, you start your preparation quickly.
When you come, I will invite mama
and everyone, we will party together.
Yes, do what you want,
just tell me how is sister?
Now you know the situation of the home,
and that Mahir?
Even Mahir left the home and went.
He is staying at a friend’s home.
Yes.
Aunty Sweetie has bothered
everyone including me.
Listen, to me. the thing is that
God has betterment in everything.
Now this woman, her allegations,
because of that you and
your father has come together
or else God knows how long these
distances would have lasted.
Even in future if we stay strong,
everything will be fine.
There is nothing like that.
These worries will be converted in happiness.
Tell Mahir not have a small heart,
tough times don’t last.
Fine, I will make him understand.
Okay fine, I am waiting for you people.
Goodbye.
Okay child.
Live long. Live long. My prince.
I worry for you so much.
Grandma, you don’t need to worry about me,
I am absolutely fine. Just pray for me.
I do that, but I think about you often how
my prince will be living in a stranger’s home.
Welcome. Welcome. Mahir. How are you?
I am so happy to see you.
You know, I was so worried for you,
ask your father.
I don’t need to ask anyone anything
and you too shouldn’t worry for me.
Thank you.
Mahir, look I…
I am really embarrassed on my past behavior
and I promise this wont happen in future.
Look, your step mom
has such a big home
and you have left it and
you are staying with someone else.
It doesn’t look nice.
Come on, leave it, you come back.
I think you are preparing
for a new game. Huh?
I will tell you something,
now I wont tolerate it.
I want to blow you away with a canon.
Mama, I am telling you
that Mahir comes back.
After all, why shouldn’t he?
It is his house. I am really saying it
with my heart, Mahir you come back.
I will.
Don’t worry. I will come back really soon,
but after I do something on my own.
Grandma,
even if small,
I have decided to start my own business.
Congratulations. Congratulations
You wont get anything doing
a business in this country.
Grandma,
uncle Zaman has said he will really
help me out in my business.
Any form of guidance or any loan
I require, he is willing to give it.
Look Mahir, all this is yours,
why do you need to do a business.
Okay, come on, let go of your anger.
Okay, you tell me, what should I cook for you?
What do you want to eat?
Food?
Hey, grandma, Rania had made such
great food that I ate so much.
Rania has a lot of taste in her hand.
I ate at uncle Zaman’s home,
my stomach is full.
Oh, that is great.
Grandma,
I will take guidance from uncle Zaman,
but taking a loan from him,
my pride doesn’t allow me
to take money from him.
I will say no to him.
But to start the business,
I will still need money, you will help me, right?
Hey when do you need my help son?
This entire home,
this whole wealth is in your name,
whenever you want, you can sell it
and invest it in your business.
Don’t worry about us,
I will live in a small home. Don’t worry.
No, no, grandma, nothing like that will ever happen.
Thank you so much.
Without your permission,
I couldn’t even think of doing anything like that.
After all, you are the head of this family.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you have so much courage?
Do you consider me so weightless?
Who?
I am the one who showed you
stars in the day time.
I hope you recognize me now.
Oh, okay. Mama’s bad luck…
oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
are you mama’s bad luck?
Shut up.
Control your tongue.
Mahir is our son,
how dare you offer him help?
He is our son and
he is now living at our home.
You stay away from him, understand?
You are wasting your time.
You know I will not listen to you. Right?
I will become stubborn instead.
So it is better that you go and
tell Mahir to stay away from me.
Hmm…
I think you forgot your insult.
No. No. I will always remember that.
And it would better that
you don’t call me again.
Because it is possible that next time
I wont be able to talk with respect.
I too am not interested in calling you.
I am just warning…
She is a stubborn and ill-mannered girl.
Hey that old woman is
really cunning and cheap.
She has changed her methods
in such a way that I am scared.
They say for such people that being their friend
is not good, nor is being their enemy good.
I am not stupid.
I see it all and I also understand.
Okay grandma, I will leave now.
You just came, sit.
By the way, Mahir, ask Rabail,
everyone misses you so much.
You took the liveliness
of the home with you.
My children are always sad,
they are asking for brother Mahir all the time.
I know, but you don’t be sad.
All of us will live together really soon.
Okay tell me, you are coming for uncle Ayaz
and Bebo’s engagement, right?
First let their proposal get fixed.
I don’t know
if they accept his proposal or not.
By the way, Rania will try.
Uncle Ayaz is good
and he really likes Bebo.
Oh, is this it?
Then I too am Rania’s grandmother,
I will make sure this proposal gets fixed.
No matter what Zaman says,
I will make sure this proposal gets fixed.
Long live, mama.
You know, the prayers of sad
hearts are answered quickly
and uncle Ayaz will raise his hand
and pray for you all his life.
Okay then.
Okay grandma, I will leave.
Take care, I am late.
Take care.
Goodbye.
Live long. Live long.
Goodbye. Okay uncle, goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Greetings madam.
Greetings.
Please make me a cup of tea.
I have a bad headache.
I will just make it.
Is papa back?
No, he has not come till now.
Okay, just make me tea.
Madam, this sir is also
waiting for elder sir.
Mahir, you?
Sorry, I didn’t see you.
Obviously,
now you have become
so rich that you don’t see us.
I am still the same Rania,
but those who give preference to wealth
over people wont understand me.
Anyway, it is okay.
Make a cup of tea for him too.
Sure.
No, there is no need for that. It is okay.
Why? Why is there no need?
Have you stopped drinking tea?
Come on.
First you tell me something, Rania.
Why did you hide something
so big from me?
That Dr. Wasiq is not your brother,
why didn’t you tell me this?
What are you saying?
when did I hide it and when did you ask me?
Yes, fine, I didn’t ask you,
but still,
you should have mentioned it to me.
Mentioned what?
I feel you are not well.
Now you won’t find me well,
nor will you think I am feeling well.
If you say these things,
then I really won’t feel you are fine.
You have changed a lot, Rania.
If that Dr. Wasiq is not your brother,
then with what relation is
he living in this home?
Papa must be on his way,
you can ask him. Okay?
And also record your objection.
I feel you are really disturbed at Salik’s home,
that is why you are saying such weird things.
I am not saying weird things.
And I don’t like this Dr. Wasiq one bit.
So this is your issue. Not mine.
Who have you liked till today?
You have always praised yourself.
You feel that if you look at a girl properly,
she will fall in love with you.
You are mistaken, and remember,
those who praise themselves,
are often left alone.
Papa must be coming,
I will send tea.
I shouldn’t have spoken
so rudely to Mahir.
The poor thing is already in a tough situation.
He came to ask papa for advice.
What must he be thinking?
That my mind is in the skies,
I am showing tantrums.
Argh, what is wrong with me.
I am doing stupid things.
I made such a big mistake.
I should have stood by him
like a sincere person.
I shouldn’t have asked Rania about Dr. Wasiq.
What must she be thinking about me?
I don’t know what is wrong
with me nowadays.
I am acting so stupid.
I go to say one thing and I say another.
My respect is ruined.
What do I do now?
Should I go and say sorry?
I will go say sorry.
Madam Rania, sir is asking about you.
Okay, I am coming.
Listen, the guest that came,
he is still there, right?
No madam, he left.
He left?
Didn’t papa stop him for dinner?
Hey madam, sir stopped him
and he even agreed,
but he left as soon as little master came.
He said he has something important to do.
Okay I am coming, you go.
Sure.
Man, this is the limit.
Mahir is mad.
Now what do I do?
I don’t know what issue
he has with Dr. Wasiq.
Salik, I feel that my life has been
surrounded by difficulties from all sides
and I am unable to handle it.
I don’t know
what I am doing in my worry?
Look Mahir, good and
bad situations are part of life.
Don’t worry like this, don’t worry.
after all I have spoken to papa,
the loan will get approved, you will see.
Hey loan…
it is not about money, man.
I am worried cause of Rania.
One minute. One minute. One minute.
Did you misbehave
with his respectable father?
Mahir, how many times have
I told you not to show attitude.
Keep it on the side.
Be down to earth.
Man, you be quiet.
Don’t talk nonsense.
Hey, did his father drag you out
thinking of you as a poor relative?
If this was my home,
then I would have surely
dragged you out of this home.
But what can I do?
I am helpless,
this is your home.
I myself am dependent on you.
Mahir, what are you saying?
What is this your and mine?
In future please don’t say this again.
Whatever I have is all yours. Okay?
Okay stop now.
Don’t be too filmy.
This home is mine.
Man, Salik,
this journey of mine is tough and long.
I don’t know who all will be
able to walk with me.
I don’t want to lose Rania.
If Rania is with me,
I can handle the most difficult
of situations like this, easily.
But she is becoming really distant from me.
What if she goes really far?
Okay, one crispy green beans and
surely bring shrimps, also California roll.
Two. Ceaser salad.
And yes, coconut curry. Vegetable.
And crispy honey chicken too
and do please bring fresh lime.
Have we invited someone else too?
No, just the two of us. Two doves.
Just order enough that we can eat.
This is not the last lunch of our life.
Listen to me, I hate miserly men.
Okay sorry, I was joking.
Brother bring whatever you have.
There is no need.
Just bring what we ordered.
I don’t eat much, this is enough.
Enough? It should be enough.
Go.
Listen, should I give you a shocking news?
Farhad’s uncle is getting
married to Rania’s aunt.
He is average. Middle class.
I sympathize with Bebo.
Poor thing.
I don’t understand, how can someone
spend their life without money.
I too want to shock you too.
Oh God.
I know you are going gift
me a new phone, right?
Our business is really down.
I have asked papa Mona is unlucky.
Since we fixed the proposal,
we are facing loss.
Now what if Mona that till the marriage
we face so much loss
that we are forced to go into our great
grandfather’s business…I mean scrap business.
But you know what papa said?
He said no one has dark steps,
it is the situation of the country that
a person doesn’t have money to eat food,
so where will a person gather cement etc,
to make a home, why would he think about it?
What happened?
Why are you staring at me so much?
Did you get spice in your eyes?
Take this.
What did you call me?
What happened?
You heard about the loss in the business
and decided to end all relations.
Have patience, calmly,
everything will be fine my love.
Listen, now no need to
call me love before marriage,
because I am not that type of girl.
Okay sorry, I wont. Promise.
What else did you say?
You called me unlucky.
Okay. Okay. Sorry. It slipped my tongue.
I don’t know what and
where you have to say to a girl.
Look we have ordered so much food,
at least eat it and go,
or else you will think at night
that I wish I had eaten.
Please sit, please. Sorry.
You don’t want to eat anything else, right?
Yes, I forgot to ask him for coffee,
do tell him to bring it.
Honey, we have met after so many years,
happy to see you. How was your journey?
It was good but tiring.
Yeah.
Meet him, the most arrogant,
handsome and dashing man
has come to welcome you.
His name is Mahir.
Hi.
Hi, how are you?
I am good, how are you?
I am…
sick.
I don’t think you are fine.
Salik, I think we should take him to the doctor.
You know, flu can be very contagious.
No. No. it is fine.
In America they are scared of flu,
but here it is really common.
I will be fine. if a medical store comes on the way,
stop the car, I will get some medication.
Honey, don’t worry at all.
He is absolutely fine.
You started your drama seeing a girl.
Please, can you pass?
Salik, very bad.
What sort of a friend are you?
He has a high fever.
We should take him to a doctor.
No. No. It is okay.
I told you,
there is no need to go to a doctor.
I will get fine after taking medication
from the medical store. Thank you.
Mahir.
Bless you.
Dr. Wasiq’s clinic is on the way,
should I get you treated there properly?
Salik, you will feel really embarrassed
being beaten in front of your cousin.
If you want to save yourself from embarrassment,
then medical store and medicines.
Did you clean it properly?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Mian Jee, Bebo and mama are
coming in exactly three hours.
I am so happy I cannot tell you.
I will do this, you go check
the arrangements in the kitchen.
Yes, I will.
Do one thing, tell me what my order was.
Yes, are those two done?
Fine. Fine.
And do bring those cold drinks.
I will send you my address. Yes. Yes.
Hey Salik, how are you?
I am fine, Rania, but Mahir is not well
and he is not agreeing to go to the hospital.
He is insisting for no reason.
I cannot control him at all.
What? What happened to Mahir?
He has high fever.
Okay I am coming. Yes, yes,
I am coming right now. I am reaching shortly.
Okay. Okay.
I will just SMS…
Doctor. Doctor.
You will have to come with me.
Right now?
The guests are about to arrive.
Hey, when will they go back
if we are not here?
There is anyway a lot of
time for them to come still.
Mahir is unwell, he needs me.
Please come with me.
Okay,
now I understand this worry of yours.
You understand, right?
Shall we go?
Come on. Come on.
Just a second.
Careful.
One minute. One minute.
Thank you.
Bless you.
Honey, you are my cousin.
Meaning both my respect and shame.
And this is Pakistan,
here you don’t hold arms.
Is this the time to talk about these things?
See, he is so unwell.
No. No. It is okay. Thank you.
I am fine. actually, in my home…
Bless you.
I have never fallen ill like this. that’s why.
You go inside and meet uncle and aunty,
they must be waiting for you.
Are you sure?
Yes. Yes. I am fine.
Are they here? They are here!
Greetings!
How are you my love?
Greetings.
My child. How are you?
I am fine.
How was your journey, child?
Really good.
Come on. Come on.
She has grown up so much,
she must be tired.
Come child, come quickly.
This cousin of yours,
sympathizes a little more than 
what is required.
Come on, take me to the room.
Yes, so come on.
Who has stopped you?
Why are you pushing me?
I am already unwell,
my head is spinning, I also see less.
Mahir, you are not that unwell, okay?
I know you well.
Don’t consider me like Honey.
Come on. Come on. Listen,
keep this Honey away from my room.
Hello dear Honey.
How are you?
Are you fine? have you reached safely?
Was there any issue in the flight?
Not at all.
Actually the flight was really comfortable.
Very good. Very good.
Okay tell me, Honey,
are you uncle and aunt fine?
Yes, they are all fine.
actually they got really happy to see me.
You know old relations
have a different attraction.
Yes, Honey, child, that is true. That is true.
Hello Honey, you immediately called uncle after
reaching Pakistan, you should have called me.
You are always jealous of me.
This is the limit.
I was also going to call you.
Honey, you should have called me first.
I am your real relative.
Here I am tired of conspiring for
your bright future but you don’t care.
That is not true aunty,
actually uncle was saying for a few days….
Okay leave all this
and come home immediately.
Sorry aunty,
I cannot come so soon.
What do you mean you
cannot come so soon?
Listen to me, Honey.
I am as hard as I am soft.
What if I come to get you myself?
Aunty I told you I will stay here for a few days,
I cannot come. Okay bye.
I think this Honey wants
her legs broken by me.
Oh, there she also has
a cousin from his uncle.
Oh, if they trap Honey,
then my entire plan will fail.
She didn’t even call.
Salik,
you had said that you
informed Rania that I am unwell.
Hey Mahir, I informed her, I wont lie to you.
You informed her?
She didn’t come even
after you informed her.
this means she doesn’t care about me.
She can go to hell.
This means brother you have failed to win her heart,
 and you have also lost your bet.
Hey, to hell with that bet,
and don’t even mention that bet after today.
How are you feeling now?
Everything is absolutely fine,
you don’t need to worry.
It is time for his medication.
Did you call his parents or not?
Hey, I only have fever.
What is the need to call and
inform the whole of Pakistan?
Look, listen to me,
you took a long flight and rest.
Don’t worry about me.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Salik.
Salik.
Hey, Rania is here. Rania is here.
Are you okay? He has fainted.
Oh God, what did you do to him?
Why have you still not
taken him to the hospital?
What are you standing there for?
Come and check him.
I should check? Yes.
He is absolutely fine. Nothing happened to him.
Nothing to worry about.
Huh? Yes.
Yes, yes I am absolutely fine.
Nothing to worry about.
What will happen to me?
I was staging a drama in front of you people.
And this friend of mine, Salik, 
he cares about me.
He cares for me that is why he called you people 
and asked you to come.
And why have you people come here?
You people don’t need to care for me.
Go from here. Leave. I am fine.
How is he fine?
See how out of breath he is.
He is not well at all.
He should have a complete
check up from a good doctor.
What do you mean?
Is he not a good doctor?
He is a capable doctor,
he has fixed the best.
Rania, you are using the wrong idiom.
So? Hang me.
Man, you people stop arguing.
Here I am unwell
and you people are arguing.
Go. Leave. Leave from here.
I don’t need anyone, leave me alone.
I cannot leave you alone like this.
This way your stress level will go up.
Who is she? What is she doing here?
Sorry, I forgot to introduce you to her.
This is my cousin, she came from America.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh now I understand
why Mr. Mahir was in a bad mood.
We came at the wrong time,
there are already enough
people to care for him here.
Come on, doctor.
Okay come on.
I am leaving.
I am not in the habit to care
for someone for no reason.
Rania. Rania. Rania, you just came
and doctor you came for the first time,
I will get great tea for you.
No. No. No.
There is no need for this formality.
After all, I just came here
because Rania asked me.
As far as tea is concerned,
we will have it on the way.
This way we will have an outing too.
Shall we go, Rania?
Yes.
Shall we.
Lets go.
Come on. Take care.
They had to go for an outing and
they used me as the excuse.
Why does this happen with me?
Yes, sir?
Two special tea.
Okay.
Please.
The tea here is really famous,
if you want anything else,
I can get that too.
Can I get poison?
Will you eat it here or at home?
Very funny.
You were fine like you were earlier,
annoyed and ill-mannered.
You are the one who taught me to laugh.
Yes, I was mad.
But right now fix your mind.
Please, fix your mood,
your family is coming over, what will they think?
that we have kept you sad.
Right now I am really angry.
Did you see?
Did you see how happily
he was talking to them
and as soon as I went he closed his eyes
and lied down like he was unwell.
He couldn’t wait for me to leave
and his party time would start.
How many times will you
repeat the same thing,
you have been saying this all the way,
stop it now.
That cunning girl.
Did you see how informal she was.
These people from America are really clever.
I didn’t pay attention.
But I paid attention.
Okay whoever she was,
whatever she was doing, why do you care?
Yes, you are right.
But I must have gotten insulted.
Those people must be laughing at me
that I came running hearing the news.
And Mahir too didn’t give me any attention.
It is all that Salik’s fault,
he shouldn’t have told me.
I am sorry, it is all your fault,
you shouldn’t have gone there.
I am caring,
I cannot see anyone in pain.
Now I will go if they tell me
he is unwell. What if?
What if Mahir is staying there
for so long because of this?
Yes, it is possible.
The girl was really good.
Yes, but maybe she was caring for him.
Hey wow. Wow. Wow.
Where did the sun come out from today?
A cap on your head?
Tasbeeh in your hands.
Is everything fine, uncle?
I am praying. Praying.
What is wrong, uncle?
Why do you look so worried?
Is everything fine?
Yes, Asma called, those people have
reached Lahore. I am worried.
Yes, so what is there to worry in this?
Mian Jee is not a gang and
they have not come to rob Lahore.
Talk with respect,
he is my future father in law.
Father in law? Yes. When did that happen?
Lets imagine that your future
father in law and his son fail you, then?
Scare me. you too scare me.
Your mama is doing this well
with me for a few days.
No, you too scare me. Scare me.
Hey, I am not scaring you uncle,
I am trying to make you understand.
Look, see, you should get a shock slowly.
No, what do I lack?
I have biceps of metal, I look like Fawad.
Chaudary? Yes, 
he too is a hero in his mother’s eyes. Okay?
What do I lack?
I am one in a million. One is million.
I will tell you what you lack.
Hey you don’t walk with confidence,
what you say has no weightage,
you have no money in your pocket,
and everything else is first class? Third class.
Hey, I have a good job,
there is a good chance of promotion.
Fine. Fine. it is good to be
mistaken a person stays happy.
Mistaken?
I think I will concentrate on my prayers.
Uncle, don’t worry. You are forgetting,
we have a soldier there.
Yes. Rania.
Yes. Rania will never let this mission fail.
You are right, she will never step back.
That girl will stand till the last moment.
May God give her success. Ameen.
You are right, uncle.
Right now Rania really needs prayers.
I am praying for her.
You do one thing,
get eleven different type of fruit,
and make a doll out of dough,
and pin lemon in its eyes,
and then bury it in any such grave,
who has died of corona virus.
Okay. Where did you see this prayer?
What is behind you? What is it?
Oh God. God. God,
accept this prayer of mine.
After this I wont any prayer after this.
this is the last one. The last one.
Yes, Rania.
Where is mama? Let me talk to her.
Yes, yes, mama is right in front of me. here.
Mama I am putting it on speaker,
you talk to Rania.
Yes, give it.
Hello child. Is brother there?
No, he has not come yet.
I called to say that Mahir left the home
and you took him out of your heart too.
Have you forgotten his love, his affection,
his great sacrifice and his great nature,
that you used to mention in front of everyone.
Everything else is fine,
but I don’t remember his great nature and sacrifice.
Which one was it?
Oh, sorry, sorry,
I said too much out of emotion.
Mama, Mahir is unwell.
What?
How?
He is unwell. What happened to him?
Oh my poor son,
please take me to him as well.
Yes, he is lying alone
at his friend’s home.
Go and bring him somehow and
if he doesn’t come then, then pick him up.
You did good that you told me.
I will go right now and bring him.
But you know he is stubborn,
God knows if he will come or not.
What is the issue? He will come here,
at least that witch aunt wont be there.
Huh? What did you say, child?
I didn’t hear you.
I am saying mama,
just like I was living at his home,
he too can live at my home.
It is the same thing.
Yes, it is the same thing. Yes. Okay. Come on.
Come on, I will put the phone down.
We will come with Mahir.
I will bring him and come. Okay bye.
Here, hold your phone.
Come on, let’s go.
I will go get my son,
I don’t know what condition he will be in.
Mama, take me with you too.
If you go he will never come. You sit here.
Mama, you will see,
I will act like a real mother.
Doctor,
why are you so worried?
I would say it is not right to go so deep.
I would say that present
your case to Kali Baba,
you will get success or
you can change my name.
Okay? Tell me.
This issue is solved.
What issue Rania?
I told mama to bring her beloved home
and keep him home, take care of him.
She has left him with strangers.
Rania, you are thinking about Mahir,
you are scheming?
Yes, so why should I not scheme?
Did you see doctor,
how that girl was getting frank with Mahir?
What is her relation with Mahir?
Fine, I admit she is Salik’s cousin,
but that doesn’t mean she stays
on Mahir’s head all the time.
Rania, why are you acting like a crowd.
It is possible Mahir gave her permission himself.
That’s not possible.
Bless you.
if you have some oranges then
your weakness will be removed.
But till then lets check your fever.
Open up.
No, no, I don’t have fever…Oh.

Hey, I will tell you.
