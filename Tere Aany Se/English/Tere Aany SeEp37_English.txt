Yes,
what are you thinking about?
Huh? My smart child.
Nothing, Mian Jee, just like that.
Child,
when you came in this world,
then the first person
who picked you in his arms was me.
I can read your face.
But you are really smart,
several times I don’t find out.
Tell me, share it with Mian Jee,
your burden will be reduced.
I told you Mian Jee,
there is nothing like that.
Then why are you sitting sad like this?
You are worried for no reason.
Tell me, did you need something?
Yes, I wanted something.
Sit here. Sit down.
I wanted to ask you a question,
are you ready to answer?
Yes, I am ready, ask me.
I want to ask what do you
think about the engagement?
Now don’t give me stories,
answer straight forward.
If someone else is getting engaged,
it is a good thought,
and if you are talking about my engagement,
then it is a clear no.
Mian Jee, as per my personal
opinion both things must happen.
First engagement, then marriage.
Like this people will get
a chance to attend two functions.
And it will be a lot of fun.
I want to talk about a serious topic,
and you are….
Go come on, make tea.
Make tea and also fry some fritters.
Mian Jee, this will take a lot of time.
Yes, so I also need a lot of time to talk.
Come on, go.
Ye child, then tell me,
what do you want to do in your future life?
You know my plan from the start, Mian Jee,
I have to become the prime minister.
In fact, I am thinking it is time
to enter professional politics too.
Yes, child.
The lessons for professional politics
can also start from home.
For example,
the politics of mother and daughter in law.
the politics of daughter and sisters in law,
the politics of husband and wife.
If a person goes from home prepared like this,
then they can be really successful in the world.
Yes. everything is possible.
You know this boy, Wasiq, he is good.
Mian Jee, I came to ask
what pakoras will you have?
Eggplant or spinach?
Hey, make it out of sand, do anything.
I am talking on a serious topic here.
Come on, go.
Okay, then I will make it out of potatoes,
even Rania likes them.
No need to bother for me.
I don’t want to eat them.
The same problem all the time.
What happened to her, Mian Jee?
Can you not see, she doesn’t like pakoras.
Problems, trouble.
Anyway, Mahir is coming in the evening,
tell Asiya to get food made under her supervision.
Why is this Mahir coming?
No need to serve him.
His American returned mother is there,
she will take care of him.
She will cook for him.
Now she has even invited her help,
her adopted daughter.
Cunning woman.
Mahir wanted such a girl. He deserves this.
Cunning. Witch.
Child, isn’t this a bit much?
Do you have a personal problem with her?
You will see Mian Jee,
this mother and daughter will
make Mahir move to their orders.
Oh my.
Did you fry the pakoras?
I hadn’t started,
I just came to ask you right now.
Hey Honey, what do you feel
I will think something wrong for you?
Right now I have not thought about it,
but I know this that
you didn’t take this decision in my love.
You did it for your own benefit.
You need this home and you also know
that you can never get it by force.
Hey, damn you Honey.
This means you don’t trust me.
Madam Sweetie.
Madam Sweetie. Madam Sweetie.
One minute, first hear me out.
If you don’t look good,
you should say good things.
This Honey has burned my heart.
Sweetie, I came to tell you
that Mahir out of all the people…
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
I was sure this would happen.
I knew Mahir is a clever boy,
he will get a little upset, but he will agree after that.
Hey, this is the sad part, he didn’t understand
and he has said no in front of everyone.
Damn it, idiot.
Now he will see the bad consequences
of this with his own eyes.
I am going to the lawyer,
will you come with me or not?
We will now decide about the property in the court.
Hey Sweetie, calm down.
Look, we can sit and calmly find a solution for this.
You have become stubborn like the politicians.
Return all the dollars you used to send
these people from there, I will cool down.
What are you saying, Sweetie?
The dollars I used to earn there by working hard,
I have sent those to my family.
Does someone take money for helping out their wife?
Only a low life like you do this.
Now you will see, I will make the life of
every single family member of yours hell.
Aunt Sweetie, you get hyper really quickly.
You don’t need to make anyone’s life hell.
What you say will happen,
and I will handle everything.
You just don’t need to get angry.
If you were worthy of this,
then he wouldn’t have publicly said no like this.
Only time will tell what I am worth.
Right now, you won’t go to a lawyer, okay?
Okay.
I will wait for a few days,
but if nothing happens during this time,
then I am going to the lawyer.
Okay. Okay. I don’t need a lot of time.
Relax.
The situation doesn’t change
if you close your eyes like a pigeon.
Today we have come to either fix
or finish this story.
So be brave and come on.
Oh wow.
Greetings Mian jee.
Hey, great to see you all.
Where are you young people coming from today?
Huh? Mahir, you have forgotten your
Mian Jee, yes? You don’t even meet me.
Mian Jee, how is this possible?
Hey it is possible,
you don’t come, I keep on waiting.
If I tell you honestly Mian Jee,
you are great people.
What if you think that
I come here often for a reason.
Son, a great person is one who has humanity,
I consider him to be great.
You are a good man.
You should meet me. Okay, enjoy yourself.
I will go pray. Come on.
Come, you people, have a seat.
I will send tea.
Rania, we didn’t come here to have tea.
We came to meet you. You come and sit with us.
Whether you drink it or not,
but we have guests over,
it is my responsibility to serve them.
I will send tea.
I will come with you.
Okay.
You people sit.
I don’t know where these two are.
How long will they make us wait?
Hey Rabail must be making
Rania understand, it will take time.
And Mahir hear me out clearly,
today you won’t stay stubborn.
When Rabail will convince Rania,
then you too come in front and then you too…
what do they say?
Express your love. Express it. Okay?
Let us also go. Let’s go. come on. Come.
You give these two teas
and send them on their way.
You can stay with me,
but send away Mahir and his friend.
Hmmm…I fell you are jealous.
Why would I be jealous of useless people?
That is true as well.
You know, brother has said no to marrying Honey.
Really?
Okay as he wishes, why would I care?
By the way, they look good together.
Brother loves you.
Who said this to you?
He told me himself and
Salik too was witness to this.
Oh, okay.
Rania, care for this love.
If he expresses it, don’t reject it, please.
You are really naïve Rabail,
you know nothing.
Yes, I am naïve, but not stupid like you.
Rania, a man wants to marry you,
what can be a bigger proof of someone’s love than this?
How can a selfish,
arrogant and cruel man like him understand love?
I don’t think he even knows what love is.
Maybe he just traps girls in his love and laughs at them.
He bets.
Then when he wins the bet, he celebrates his victory.
A girl like me,
for whom her self-respect and name is everything,
I cannot be trapped in his love.
What I am saying, this is the truth.
Good.
Very good.
This should happen with a man like you.
You were really proud of yourself.
See.
See, how that girl made you bow down?
Is the bet you made?
You wanted to make fun of Rania?
You know, I used to consider Rania wrong
and you my friend. I am so stupid.
Rania has shown you the mirror brother.
In future don’t even try to make fun of a girl.
Oh hey, easy. Relax.
I was not making a joke out of her.
I really love her.
Yes, but this is also true
that you had bet with me.
Oh man. Yes I did.
I did bet. But that was my stupidity.
I made a mistake that I…
I really love her, man.
I don’t want to lose her.
Are you speaking the truth?
This is the truth.
I agree betting was my fault
and I am also embarrassed on that fault.
And he.
You know everything, man,
still you are standing against me with them.
Hey, I made a mistake
but you also see how much
I have served her grandfather.
What for? To make room in his heart.
I broke all records of decency in front of her father.
Seeing her with Dr. Wasiq, I burned my heart,
I ate fire, I did it all, I sacrificed it, for whom? For Rania.
Look girls, he is right.
He really loves this girl.
But Rania doesn’t trust you at all.
I know,
she is mad.
She has a lot of ego.
You people will have to help me.
How can we help you?
Mahir you talk a lot otherwise
and today a naïve girl is not able to believe your love.
Show the magic of your sweet tongue.
Rania has always been misled about me, man.
No matter what I do,
she will never believe me.
But you people,
she will listen to you people.
You people can help me.
What?
Why are you staring at each
other with flat expressions?
Help me out.
Hey, what sort of friends are you people?
Can you not see this sadness,
this sorrow, this sad face of mine?
See. See. See. See.
Laughing faces don’t mean
that they don’t get hurt,
in fact, it means that
they know how to deal with their pains...
That’s it man, stop being so cringey,
we heard you. Yes, it is done.
Come. so, I was saying that somehow...
You be quiet.
Your tea.
Yes, thank you.
Hey this Mahir and the girls they left suddenly,
did you not invite them for food?
Leave it, Mian Jee.
These are busy people of the city,
they don’t have so much time.
What is the matter?
Did you have a fight between you and Mahir?
Huh?
No. No Mian Jee, what sort of fight?
Okay.
He is going to get married,
did you congratulate him?
No. No Rabail told me,
Mahir has said no to the proposal.
This had to happen,
how could Mahir get in a relation with
aunt Sweetie’s adopted daughter?
He really dislikes aunt Sweetie.
He said no?
He did something stupid, he is a good girl.
Okay, I will make him understand.
What? You will make him understand?
Mian Jee for my sake, you won’t do this.
Hah, why?
You just won’t do it.
In fact, you promise me that you won’t do it.
In the village, us grandfather and granddaughter would
solve everyone’s issues, what is the matter here?
The people of the city are different.
We should get into the fights of others.
Okay.
If we shouldn’t then we won’t.
Hey Rafiq Ahmed,
Khaver and Mona’s proposal got fixed,
we fixed the date.
So you have two weeks,
so you can tighten his nuts.
He is out of his mind.
Mama, please understand my position.
Give me a little respect like a son in law.
Be quiet Khaver, sister is absolutely right.
Mama, why don’t we make things lively?
Let’s have a musical evening or something.
It will be fun. Right? after all,
I have got so many clothes stitched, when will I show off?
Your wife is right, you know.
Yes, she is right.
Is this even something to say?
I know you.
You do one thing call the neighbours,
then ask for a drum, then also call Rania to come.
It will be fun so that everyone knows
that there is a wedding in this home.
Mahir, son, why do you have a long face,
did you lose something?
My heart is lost, grandma.
You lost your heart?
What?
I have lost the locket with a heart.
I was talking about it.
Oh, don’t take it to your heart.
No problem. Why worry about the locket?
Your friend had a shop,
he has several lockets.
Mahir, you don’t worry,
we will all find it together.
You will find your heart locket soon.
thank you, Honey.
Yes, yes, son. Yes.
I will order it from Dubai for you.
Come on son, don’t have this
long face for a small locket.
God will give you a lot more.
Seema, call Rania,
ask her to come, so that we can enjoy.
I don’t enjoy it when she is not here, I swear.
Okay, mama.
Child, what is this drama?
This girl keeps on crying.
Qalandar.
Yes I don’t know our prayers don’t get answered.
Hah.
Sister in law.
Sister in law.
Yes. Yes.
You know, mama called.
She said that they are coming to fix Mona’s date.
They have invited us all.
Wow.
It will be so much fun,
we will also play the drum.
Yes.
This is true, we will have fun.
Hey Rania, why are you always in
a corner like a sick chicken?
Decide what you want to wear tomorrow.
Uncle, I would say that along with Mona,
we should also send off our Bebo.
After all, her in-laws are really restless.
Yes, the sooner a person fulfils their responsibility
towards their daughters, the better.
What else? Fine.
Mian Jee.
Yes?
I want to talk to you and
Asiya about Rania’s proposal.
Go ahead.
Wasiq is a good boy.
He will keep Rania really happy.
I think there can be no better
proposal for our Rania than this.
Oh, I swear, I really like Wasiq.
The best thing is that he is a real doctor.
At our village, even the fake doctors have
a lot of respect, Bebo. He is a real doctor.
Hey, it is really good that he is a doctor but
this wedding is not a game of dolls.
A person fixes a wedding after thinking hard.
That boy is not leaving the home
and going, he is here.
Hey, no, Mian jee, he is an obedient boy,
why would he do this?
Then calm down,
whatever has to happen will happen.
Okay sister in law, be quick.
We have to prepare too.
Mama must be waiting, we will get late.
Hey, Bebo, the function is not today,
it is tomorrow.
Someone is really restless to go to sister’s home.
Come on, let’s go to the kitchen.
Will you come with us? Huh?
No, Mian Jee, what will I do there?
You people go ahead.
Yes, you are a serious man.
When do you sit with jolly people?
No, Mian Jee, I don’t mean that.
Hey, this drama is the same too,
the girl is crying again.
All this is the doctor’s conspiracy
or else where did papa
think of my marriage suddenly?
I will not leave this doctor.
I will make sure he forgets about marriage.
Damn him.
What are you talking to yourself about?
Leave me alone right now, Bebo.
I am really angry.
That is what I came to find out
that what is my Rania angry about.
Okay, so I tell you this myself too?
Did you not hear what your brother said?
I am sure mama must be agreeing to him.
So what is bad about the doctor?
I mean, Rania,
parents look for the best of
the best for their children.
And when such a good proposal is
present at home, then you do think.
See.
See, you too agree with your brother.
All of you have made me alone.
You and me are separate, that is not possible.
Even if you don’t tell me
what is in your heart or not, I know it all.
Yes, but maybe you don’t know
what is in your heart,
or maybe you are acting like
you are unaware on purpose.
You are back.
Yes, I am back.
I feel you were waiting for me restlessly.
Yes. I was waiting for you really restlessly.
Tell me something, for so many years,
you were single, there was no issue then.
What is the problem now that
you immediately want to get married?
Problem?
Yes.
It feels like you don’t like me getting married.
There is something like that.
Tell me father,
that you don’t want to get married right now.
Or else you will see the worst in me.
You are weird, my life has become hell.
Problem?
Okay uncle, you made the tea get cold.
NI cooled it down with difficulty.
Uncle, you make Rania understand.
What?
She was scolding the doctor and the poor,
innocent doctor is listening to her
with his head bowed down.
She is such a small girl
and she has raised hell.
Tell her not to become everyone’s aunt.
hey, what was she saying?
I didn’t hear it clearly,
but she was saying something like
I have spent my entire life single,
why do you want to get married now?
These things this girl says,
we will miss out on such a good proposal.
I am saying uncle before anything goes wrong,
I would say fix the proposal.
What are you thinking? I am right.
Hey, the thing is that everyone is saying
that the boy is really good.
That is true.
Then does the girl have any will or not?
Does anyone from amongst
us has to get married or her?
When I gave my daughter
the right to marry by her will,
then what do you think
I won’t give this right to my granddaughter.
She will do what she wills.
So she wants to become the prime minister,
she will do that.
Should be reject such a good proposal
for the sake of her mad wishes?
Those who dare to dream are able to fulfill them.
You don’t worry about Rania so much,
think about Asma.
Will we get gas at Sehri time or not.
The city is worried.
You are worried about Rania.
We will have a gas loadshedding,
should I heat your tea.
No, I just told you that
I have cooled it down with difficulty.
Let it be. I will have it.
Asma, I am Ayaz.
When this little sunlight falls on your face,
what if you get a sunburn.
You are so fair.
Oh yes, this?
I got this flower for you.
Would you like to marry me, Asma?
Oh, I will bow down and say it.
Asma…oh what if brother sees me.
What if brother sees me. One minute.
Asma, how are you? Brother, how are you?
Sister.
What madness is this?
Sister I was practicing for tomorrow.
Why for tomorrow?
Mona and their event,
I was practicing to give Asma a flower there.
Flower?
Yes.
Huh? Bloody fool.
Did you iron the clothes?
I have ironed three dresses sister.
Three. I am thinking I will wear white.
I am not talking about your dress,
I am asking about my dress.
Sister, I don’t understand if I should iron
your Sari or this trouser or…
Yes, yes, how will you understand?
You are madly in love.
Hey sister what are you saying?
what are you saying?
Do you want that
I turn your age and die single?
You want this? Do you want this?
No, right? I do all your work.
I do every type of work.
I iron your clothes.
I am going around this home like a gardener,
I go around like a chef.
I am your maid, she doesn’t come.
I am going around the home, getting it cleaned.
At times I am cleaning the pipes, right?
Yes, and what about the great food
I cook with a lot of effort?
God forgive me.
Not even the animals are eating
that potatoes with eggplant.
I threw it outside the home,
even the animals looked away, It was so tasteless.
That’s it. That’s it That’s it.
You are insulting my potatoes with eggplant again?
Not anymore.
Don’t insult my food, I am telling you.
Sister, it is an insult.
If you are considering it food,
it is an insult. It is an insult.
Fine, you eat now.
You eat now.
I will keep you hungry.
I will keep you hungry. Yes. Yes.
Sister is turning into Hitler
I will practice again.
Hello Asma, how are you?
Hey brother, how are you? All well?
Hey brother. Brother, what is that?
If I won’t go,
then wont her functions happen?
If they want to fix Khaver and Mona’s date,
then they should do it without me.
I don’t want to come.
Put up a fake smile to convince the world.
When is being two faced something new for you?
You, be quiet man.
You are just a friend in name.
You cannot do something small
that your brother is in pain,
go and make Rania understand,
that whatever happened was a joke.
A mischief. I really love her.
No, man, no. she is stubborn number.
Even if I stand on my head and
make her believe, she still won’t accept it.
I don’t know what was that damned moment
when I listened to you and spoke nonsense?
You often speak such nonsense about yourself.
Now today you are blaming me.
What did you say? I told you.
Yes, you are right about this.
I feel Rania loves Mahir secretly.
Yes, I feel the same way.
She loves you but…
That’s what I am saying,
that it is not possible that someone smart,
dashing and handsome boy is around
and the girl doesn’t dream about me.
See. Did you people see?
This is him being mistaken.
You can write it down,
you will die one day, you won’t get Rania.
and hearing you talk, I want to...
Hey, enough. Enough. Enough.
Yes, Rabail what were you saying, that Rania…
I was saying that she loves you,
she is just scared to say it.
She doesn’t like defeat.
And she is afraid that
when she expresses her love,
what will be your reaction?
That’s it I have decided,
Rania will have to confess her love.
Hey, Honey don’t mess it up. Please.
Doctor Wasiq is ready to attack like an eagle.
If we make any mistake, and he will…be careful, please.
Hey, nothing will go wrong.
I will fit the formula this time.
What do we have to do?
I will tell you when it is time.
Hey Honey.
Honey, by sharing the plan,
even we can put our input in it.
Tell us at least what is the plan.
I will tell you, have patience.
Hey, at least give a hint.
Uh-huh.
Hey Honey, the plan…
You have a cruel cousin.
She says she is helping me,
but I don’t feel her help.
I don’t what plan is in her head,
she didn’t tell me anything.
My blood pressure is rising.
I don’t think you are fine.
We will do one thing,
we will go to Dr. Wasiq, we will get you treated.
Even if I am dying
I still won’t go to that doctor Wasiq.
Yes, yes, don’t go to Dr. Wasiq,
what if he gives you a poison injection.
Yes.
You two are totally thankless.
I have helped so much,
but when brother is in trouble…go ahead.
What help?
Joke around. Really?
Do you remind you what else?
Don’t be disheartened, we will do something.
Aunty what is all this?
Today, I will tell everyone
how rich of a woman I am.
What is the point aunt?
No one will get Impressed.
Oh, I just remembered,
I don’t have to talk to you.
What sort of a girl are you?
You couldn’t trap a boy like Mahir.
If you had given importance to what I had said,
then we wouldn’t have had to see this day today.
What happened?
So what I faced a loss of millions, so what?
Aunt Sweetie, you be happy.
I have decided to trap Mahir.
Very soon, we will also get engaged.
You just don’t create a scene.
Hey Honey, are you joking?
No, no, I am speaking the truth, I promise.
Oh, I will wear double
the Jewellery in this happiness.
No, no, don’t wear anymore.
If grandma sees you in this condition,
she will give you a funny title
and you will just sit and cry.
Now mama has to cry all her life
when I fly away with her son,
along with her grandson to America.
Oh Honey, you have made me happy.
Rania, be quick, everyone must be waiting.
It has been so long.
It is done.
Bebo.
Yes?
Tell me something.
Can a narcissist,
arrogant and flirty person love someone truly?
You know Rania,
these matters of the heart are really strange.
You don’t know when someone
comes close to your heart.
Now you look at me.
Yes, but how will we find out
if a person is really serious or is it a bet…
I mean how will we find out
that the love is real.
I don’t know,
I never got involved with such a person.
And now you leave all this.
We will come home comfortably at night
and find a solution for this problem.
You get ready quickly.
Yes..
You know Mahir has clearly said no to
marring that American return Honey.
I feel Mahir loves someone else.
I don’t know if he did it in someone’s love
or if aunt Sweetie’s hatred made him do this.
Hmmm.
This is such a problem, man,
you cannot find out the truth.
What is the deal?
You are thinking a lot about Mahir today.
Yes,
so he is our relative.
No matter how she is, we have a relation,
we can think about him.
We even have a relation with Dr. Wasiq
and sister in law was telling me you have said no to
that poor thing, that there is no need to get married.
This is my personal matter.
Oh, Rania, why am I all rosy?
Did I ask you to do this?
Hey, when is it too much?
You ruined my entire makeup.
You look fresh.
Uncle likes rosy.
Pink is his favourite colour.
Really?
Yes.
Hey Asiya,
how did you think of this worthless man today?
where are you?
You questioned me just like a wife.
I am your wife,
do you have any doubt?
Not just a wife,
a faithful wife.
It is not easy to sit waiting for an unfaithful man.
Leave it.
I had buried this discussion in
a corner of my home in the village.
You too don’t say these things.
As you order, madam.
Now will you tell me, why did you call?
Do you remember,
papa had told you to come to aunt’s home.
You come there, uncle will be really happy.
Fine, I will reach as soon
as I get done with work.
Any other order?
What order will I give,
you do what you want.
We will meet in the evening.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Who knows Mahir might really love me.
It is also possible.
After all, what do I lack?
I am good, educated and
also the future prime minister.
I will try to find out,
at least, I will be on one side.
