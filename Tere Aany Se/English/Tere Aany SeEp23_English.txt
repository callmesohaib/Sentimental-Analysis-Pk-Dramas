Father,
father for God's sake.
Don't test my patience.
Go away.
Aasia, for God's sake listen to me.
The gate is open.
Hurry up,
I have to close the door.
I am going, Aasia.
I will go but I will return.
I'll keep coming back
until you forgive me.
Now that the evening is over
you're coming back,
it's a little too late now.
It's very late now,
I waited for you carrying baby Rania,
but you never returned.
Sister, sister.
Uncle she's not home.
What? She should have been home,
where did she go?
What happened,
you seem so happy?
It is something to be happy about.
Won’t you share it with me?
Yes, why not, why not.
Then tell me.
Actually the thing is,
even I don't know what it is.
Laiba, I'm tired,
please bring water for me fast.
Yes mother, let me get it.
Ayaz,
you seem really happy.
Yes sister, actually even
I don't know why am I so happy.
Oh you.
Sister, can we go to grandmother's house
for tea time?
Why?
Did they invite us?
No, neighbors don't have
such formalities.
I just wanted to go.
Okay, let's see.
We won't see, let's go.
Okay, let's go.
No, we will go, sister.
Please, can I go and get ready?
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, beloved sister.
What happened to him?
I don't know mother,
well leave him, tell me.
When are we going to have an event
for brother Farhad?
I want to invite so many
of my friends.
My child, after we get done with Mona's event,
we will have our own.
Well, I didn't see Farhad,
where is he?
Brother went out for some errands.
I've taken out some clothes for the tea time,
how does it look?
What are you preparing for?
It has a lot of checks.
I will look a little boyish in this one.
No, no.
What happened to you?
What are you preparing for?
Sister, we have to go on
in the evening.
Yes.
You should also get ready then
we will go in the evening okay?
We have to go, okay?
Rabail.
Yes?
Where is that witch?
Who is the witch?
Who are you talking about?
Dude, we only have one witch
at our place, Rania.
Where is she?
It's such a bad thing, calling
a nice girl a witch.
And anyway, she is arguing with grandmother
and aunt Asma about the current situations.
Okay then it's fine.
Listen,
can you come to a shopping mall with me?
Please, please, please.
No I don't have to shop.
You have to shop with me.
Why would I shop for you,
I don't know anything about boys.
Not for boys stupid, listen to
the whole sentence.
We have to buy some things
for that Rania.
You just got her clothes.
It was just one dress,
there are so many events
at our house,
she won't be wearing the same dress
in all the events.
That's why, let's go.
Oh, why do you suddenly
care about her?
Whatever you are thinking,
there is nothing like that.
I'm only doing this
because she's an idiot,
if we don't buy her dresses
then she'll wear
whatever she feels like,
and who will be insulted? Us.
That's why. And anyway,
she's grandmother's
only brother's only grandchild,
that's her right.
Oh so this is what it is?
That's exactly what it is.
And listen,
whatever girls wear
at the weddings,
like sandals, jewelry,
bangles and whatnot.
Get all the stuff.
But don't tell her that
I bought her all that stuff,
she'll show off later, okay?
Okay, get the car out,
I will come right back after
giving this to grandmother.
Yes, yes.
The clothes are ironed.
Enough my daughter, live long,
stay happy, stay happy.
Bebo, my child,
tell me how is my brother?
What is he doing after retirement?
Whenever I call him
he says only one thing.
Sister, I'm occupied
with a lot of things,
what business he has started?
Oh, Aunt, there is no business,
people come to him with their problems
and that's what keeps him busy all day.
Okay, okay.
This princess of mine,
she's exactly like her grandfather.
She is such a lovely girl.
Aunt, stop, please stop,
she'll catch an attitude.
Appreciation is rightly deserved
she is such a nice girl,
so pious, so kind, right?
I'll pray to God to make her
more fortunate.
She stays happy
wherever she goes.
Ameen.
Let it be, grandmother, let's talk
about something else.
Where is uncle?
He, ever since he has returned
it seems like he came out of a prison.
So happy, so delighted,
he's here or there all day,
just like a little child.
God's forgiveness,
what have you done?
Seems like nobody even touched it
for the last 20 years.
Hey, hey dumb-head,
tell me one thing, what do you do
all day idle person?
Maintain it somewhat.
And listen, Seema was telling me that
you have managed the whole house.
That's how you manage the house?
Oh brother, what happened?
These are not the chores for us to do.
That Shehenshah, him, he'll do it.
Come here, come on.
I'll do it?
I was just water for you today
that is big deal,
mother has strictly forbidden me
to do anything today, I'll only study.
Don't tell her she will
take away my iPhone.
Here you go,
did you see his shoes,
they looked better than my face.
You're here acting like a Nawab's son
and there I'm being a
donkey's son for 20 years.
Really? No, no, brother,
what happened?
You are getting emotional,
there is nothing like that brother.
How am I emotional,
what are you saying?
Hammad?
What? Hammad.
What are you doing here?
For what did I send you?
I waited for you for so long
then did it myself.
Oh, I, I, actually I forgot.
Where is your focus?
That you forgot my thing.
I'm noticing your behavior.
There is no change in behavior
I'm just going to do your work.
I'm going.
Then do it fast.
I'm going.
Oh God.
Your wife insulted you in front of
your older brother.
And you kept doing
"I, I, this, that"
You've disgraced us
in the whole family.
Slave of your wife.
No brother I.
"No, I, this, that"
Sister-in-law Sweetie?
Pay my regards to her.
How do I pay your regards,
I haven't even answered the call yet.
Be patient.
Hello, darling Sweetie,
how are you?
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been
answering my phone?
That, I, that, that, I.
It has been ringing for so long,
I'm tired of calling you,
why didn't you answer?
Sweetie, that's what I've been
meaning to tell you,
I was in the bathroom.
Everyone is in the same situation,
whether it's America or Pakistan.
Wives have the same ways
everywhere.
Brother.
Whenever I call you,
you're in the bathroom,
is your stomach alright?
Yes, yes, my stomach is quite alright.
Nothing wrong with it,
I was just generally unwell.
I'm unwell, I'll talk to you later,
I have to go to the bathroom again.
That's what you get for running
away like this.
Listen, if you're that sick then
come back, come right back.
Sweetie, how can I return?
Mother isn't well either,
I have to look after her and
take her to the hospital,
you know how costly medicines
are in Pakistan.
I was saying, Sweetie,
please send some money.
She's getting stingy.
Brother do you know
what we used to think?
That you're a millionaire in America.
But you are.
Thank God,
he gave you a chance to talk about
something today, idle.
Leave, and go,
go do your wife's work.
My child it's 4:00 pm and there are
no traces of tea in this house.
Grandmother,
there are still 4 minutes left in 4,
you'll get the tea by 4,
I've given special instructions
to Shehenshah.
Mother.
Yes.
Where are you coming from?
I'm taking Mona to a salon
for a facial.
Yeah, take her it might
make a difference.
Mother.
Now what?
Mother nothing is for free,
so for facial.
Whenever you appear
it's to get money.
Here you go.
Here.
Give some extra,
I'll also get some.
Here, now that's enough.
Thank you, bye.
Oh, wow, our special guests just arrived.
Greetings.
Greetings.
How are you?
Greetings. Greetings.
Welcome uncle, do you know
our village had a similar habit,
people used to come over
whenever they want.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.
Take a seat, take a seat.
How are you?
We haven't been seeing Farhad lately,
where does he go?
He has been staying busier now,
I'll convey your message,
he'll come to meet you.
Bebo,
hurry, hurry.
Look who's here,
Rabail's in-laws,
Farhad's mother and
this is Farhad's uncle.
And this is my aunt, Bebo.
But everyone says
she looks like my sister.
People are right.
You didn't tell,
you were aunt's close relative?
Why didn't you tell,
you are Rania's Bebo?
Wait a second, wait a second,
you both know each other already?
But how?
That is a long story.
Now I have to get to know this story.
It looks like you both know each other
for a very long time,
were you class-fellows in school?
It's not like this but it feels like this.
Tea?
Shehenshah.
Your Instagram id?
Lonely_bebo.
And yours?
I love you too.
Greetings little master.
Greetings.
Should I serve the dinner for you?
No, no, not yet, in a while.
Tell me, has father returned?
He returned a few minutes ago,
but since he has returned,
he's really quiet,
and he said no to dinner as well.
Okay,
I'll see.
okay.
Hey Rabail, stop.
Yes?
Give this to Rania,
but she can never find out that
I bought this for her.
I know very well,
she won't find out.
If she gets to know
she won't accept these gifts.
Okay that's it, now go, go.
What is happening madam?
I'm repairing the buttons
on uncle Dabeer's shirt,
where were you since the morning,
didn't it take a little too long to shop?
Look at what I've bought.
Okay, show me.
Look at this, I'll see this.
Oh wow,
this is such a beautiful dress Rabail,
it'll suit you.
And this one?
How will it look on you?
These both are the same.
Yes, one for me,
one for you.
What? Rabail, no.
Rania, please don't say no,
I have shopped with
so much love for you,
if you reject it,
I will be heartbroken.
Rabail, they must be very expensive.
I'm telling you,
I'll be heartbroken if you say no.
Okay, then I'll take this.
Well how did you know
it's my favorite color?
Because I knew this colour
will look good on you.
Does that mean
we will wear the same dress?
Yes.
Yay.
Okay go and try it fast,
let me know does it fit you?
Yes, I will go and try.
Well, Rania and brother Mahir
have completely opposite mindsets,
but they go so well together.
God, whatever I’m thinking,
please make it happen,
Ameen.
Now pick up the spoon.
And stir it.
And stir it.
Inside the pot.
Yes, in the pot.
Hey,
sister, sister, what are you doing,
everything alright?
I can only cook in the kitchen
I won’t be ironing the clothes.
Oh, you’re getting witty,
you’re giving answers.
Ayaz, tell me why you’re here,
stop spinning it all.
Okay, potato aubergine?
Good.
Sister, Rania’s aunt is here
so why don’t we invite her over
for the snacks and tea.
Tea?
Yes.
Ayaz, isn’t this tea getting
important for you?
Yesterday you went there
for the tea,
now you want to invite her
for the tea.
If you’re Rania’s aunt it means
you’re like my aunt as well,
come have a seat, please.
You’re right.
Yes, yes, please, have a seat,
be comfortable.
Please, I’ll call mother.
Mother, mother.
Hey mother.
Uncle?
I could smell a soft fragrance,
what a beautiful co-incidence,
I was just talking about you
to my sister.
Sister was saying Rania’s aunt is here
so we should invite her to dinner or tea,
sister you were saying, right?
Yes, yes, yes.
Greetings. Greetings.
Have a seat,
you should’ve brought
Rania along too.
Actually I was just getting
some sunlight in the garden,
Farhad forced me to come.
Sunlight and heat aren’t made for you,
for you there are shadows,
relaxing environments,
valleys, sparrows,
some place in Europe.
You have European features,
even after being from a village.
Well our Rabail is really fortunate,
that she got all of you as in-laws.
You people are really nice.
Thank you, thank you, actually,
do I make tea for you?
No, no.
Ayaz, why would you make the tea,
tell Laiba to make it.
Sister, sister, I do all the house chores,
so I can make tea as well, what’s a big deal?
And she’ll make a really bad tea,
I’ll make it myself.
And I won’t give you a chance
to complain about it, ever.
I’ll be back, be here, don’t go.
Keep her occupied.
Tea, tea, tea.
Hot water.
Potato aubergine?
Water, water, water.
Yes, then sugar.
Now what? Tea leaves.
Hey uncle that’s spices.
Spices.
I think you’ll burn the dish of your hopes
with your own hands.
Hey Farhad, I’m getting nervous
in happiness,
I’m losing my senses in tension,
what is happening to me, what is this?
I’ll tell you the name of this disease later.
As of now, listen to me,
your special guest is outside,
give her the company.
She must be waiting for me.
Asma, I’m coming.
Darling Asma,
I’m coming.
What happened,
is it ready?
No, no, sister,
Farhad is preparing the tea.
Farhad was telling me that
a guest is like an angel
but you’re not an angel.
What is it,
why are you smiling so much?
He must’ve remembered a joke.
Yes.
Tell us the joke.
A man used to fall from
the other side of his bed,
so how did it stop?
His family got him married.
Double bed, you know,
double bed.
An elephant got a speeding ticket,
so the driver was revealed,
it was an ant.
An elephant and his girlfriend
were having sushi.
Elephants are vegetarian.
It seems like you really like elephants.
No, no, not me, my friend.
My friend wrote a book,
elephant, my partner.
He lives near the book market,
the book is in my library
if you want to see.
Mother stop moving for God’s sake.
Enough.
Put on this lip gloss.
Okay.
I’m going to pick up Mona
from the parlor,
its getting late she’ll start crying.
Okay okay, you should go.
Bye.
Mother,
mother, it’s getting late and
you’re still getting ready.
Such long preparation.
I think the groom’s side will arrive
and we won’t even be ready.
What do you think about yourself?
What do I think mother?
I’m ready, absolutely ready.
That’s your preparations?
Old pants and an ugly shirt on it?
Mother, you people are nawabs,
I’m a labor, hardworking man.
That’s how you dress in America,
you can go anywhere,
people don’t make new dresses for years,
whatever you wear.
It’s absolutely alright,
I’ll go like this.
What do you mean, we should
also be careless like them?
Are you forgetting
what parent’s son you are?
Go and wear a nice suit,
did you bring a suit along?
I, I, I did bring it.
Go wear it.
Mother I get suffocated in a suit,
it looks fine, let it be.
Okay mother I’ll wear it.
Well mother,
I’ll sacrifice in your name,
you look like Queen Elizabeth
in this getup.
I want to pay my respect to you.
Greetings, greetings queen Elizabeth.
Stop now go.
Okay listen to me, listen to me, come here,
come sit here I need to talk.
Yes mother, tell me, tell me.
We have to give a heavy
amount of money to the groom,
and while you’re giving it,
make a video.
So in case anyone denies it
in the future,
we’d have a proof to show them
to their faces.
Yes, Basheer, do I look perfect?
Yes, royalty, today the thunder of your beauty
will burn alot of people.
What heavy moustaches
Shakeel gave to me.
Sir, I think these moustaches might
weigh heavier than you, leave it.
Why do I leave it?
I’m getting this look
after putting them on.
You’ll see, my in-laws must be impatiently
grieving for me at this time.
Sir grief is for the funeral.
Wow, wow, wow,
it’s marvellous, right mother?
It’s an excellent arrangement.
Father, it’s my choice,
how can it be not excellent?
Very nice, very nice.
Come on mother,
let’s meet the guests.
Come on.
Hey, stop, stop, stop.
Wow, same dresses.
You both look beautiful.
Come on, come on, come on.
Rabail, listen, listen,
grandmother was looking for you,
she went this side.
Okay.
I’ll come with you.
Stop, stop, where are you going?
There?
It’s time for groom’s family to arrive.
Stay here with me to welcome them.
Groom’s family is coming? Did they call?
Yes, yes, yes, I got a call.
Okay then we’ll stay here.
Yes.
Hey, greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Where is Farhad,
he didn’t come?
Yes, he couldn’t make it due to work
but he’s missing the event.
Oh, okay, you should come inside.
Come on.
Wait, stop, dupatta,
it’s an expensive dress.
God, my back hurts sitting there
for so long.
And you didn’t have a better car
to pick me up?
You came with a car
that didn’t have the AC.
It was so hot.
You’re ungrateful, 
I paid by myself,
do you understand, there was a
discount on non-AC cars.
Okay everything is alright,
but it’s too hot,
order a chilled juice for me, fresh.
Mona, do I look like a waiter that
you’re demanding juice?
Stay quiet, I’m upset.
I requested mother to give me
some family jewelry,
I got nothing, I’m wearing all artificial,
does it look obvious?
Sorry, poor man’s wives are
like that. Poor.
Mona if you say something
like that again,
I won’t consider you a bride,
I’ll slap you across the face
with my sandals.
Greetings.
Even the AC aren’t working,
there is nothing like my standards here father,
nothing is settled father.
I’ll.
Not so soon, not now,
well handle him later.
God, I’ll die,
I mean wow.
You’ve got a look.
Liar will rot in hell,
aunt, careful.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Look, look, look, look at this walk,
how he’s strutting.
My blood is boiling and
you’re smiling?
I’m smiling on what
Mona is going to do to him.
Look at him, how he put on fake moustaches,
he looks like a cartoon.
Obviously not everyone
can be smart,
handsome, and intelligent like me,
right Salik?
People are delusional,
this Khawar is a thousand times
better than you.
What?
This chimpanzee?
Better than me?
Is your mind in the right place?
Actually I didn’t want to tell the truth,
but you just said,
liars will go to hell,
so I have to tell the truth.
Your brother-in-law could’ve gotten
a proper sleep at least today.
God’s forgiveness,
I’m the one sitting next to you,
in such expensive makeup.
How beautiful do I look
and instead of looking at me,
you are looking at other people?
Look at me and don’t look
at anyone else except me.
This enemy of mine,
I feel like getting him
thrown out of the hall.
Who?
Is he looking at me
or is he looking at you?
He is looking at you.
Oh, this Mahir.
Do you know this Mahir did not
want me to get married in this family,
did not want me to be the son-in-law
of this house.
Oh, so you also found out,
But why is he looking at me like this?
he wanted to marry me, I rejected.
But he was still after me for a few days
and now that I am getting married to you,
he is getting jealous.
Jealous.
I don’t know what happened to him.
Ignore him, we should take
our pictures, come on.
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
Rania.
What?
Why is this Khawar staring
at me like this? Look.
Really,
his arrogance isn’t getting
better today.
Do one thing,
arrange a pedestal fan fast, and
a packet of chewing gum as well.
Pedestal fan,
chewing gum? Why?
Subhan, I get it that the bride
and groom are important
but the actual beauty is standing here.
Please take a nice picture of us.
And send me as a
WhatsApp document, okay?
My that angle doesn’t look good,
take from this angle.
Are you only going
to take our pictures?
There is bride and groom,
get theirs as well.
By the way,
how did you like our arrangements?
It’s good.
Thank you, thank you.
But do you know?
At our place,
we have a set up on the street
and manage all the events.
And here, such a small event
and so much waste of money.
It’s good to know that
you’re simple like me.
A little.
A little?
You look so cute speaking that.
Rania?
Yes.
It looks like he has a cervical issue,
look at how stiff his neck is.
He's stiff like this
since he arrived.
It’s not a cervical problem,
it's a wealth problem.
Rich men sit with their necks
straight like this.
But he's not a rich man,
actually he doesn't seem like a man at all,
he looks like a pet bird to me.
Here I got it.
Found the pedestal fan, but finding
this chewing gum was really difficult.
Really? Give it to me.
What's the plan?
Nothing, get it plugged in, go.
Chewing gum?
Chewing gum is to chew.
Plug it in.
Plug, plug, plug.
Come on, come, bring it here.
Place it here.
Yes I'm bringing.
The groom is getting hot
for so long.
Poor man, place it right
in front of his face.
He should get the air
on this face.
Plug it, plug it, plug it Salik.
Brother-in-law, switch on the fan,
it's too hot.
Yes, I'll plug it.
If we cover his head he'll
look prettier than the girl.
That's how we get the revenge.
Pick it up, pick it up Dabeer.
Before I run out of patience.
What happened aunt?
Don't talk to me right now,
I'm really angry.
Okay.
Dabeer isn't answering the call.
How dare he? I call him
and he doesn't answer.
Well, I understand the tricks of in-laws.
I'm also Pakistani not
an American girl.
I'm thinking to go to Pakistan
and tell my in-laws.
Come on aunt.
My village blood is boiling.
Do one thing, arrange my ticket.
Listen, you dare tell anything
to uncle Dabeer.
You're my brother's daughter,
you're like a child to me,
so you'll favor me, understand?
Aunt but like this?
I returned after 20 years
but I feel like everything is the same.
Nothing changed.
Brother we're getting family pictures,
they're calling you.
Okay, you go I'll come.
Coming, coming, coming.
Excuse me brother Nasir,
wait a minute.
Hello?
Yes, yes, yes sweetie?
Come on Mr. Groom, smile,
act like a cute cat.
Hey, he can be a cat but
being cute is very difficult.
Picture, picture, picture.
3, 2, 1, cheese.
One more, one more, one more.
1, 2, 3, smile.
Dr. Wasiq,
you're so late, I've been waiting
for you for so long.
Your father didn't come?
I told you to bring him along.
Actually I did convey
your message to father
but he wasn't really well
so he couldn't come.
He's unwell?
What happened to him?
Let me talk to him.
Oh, no, no he isn't even that sick,
you should enjoy this
event peacefully.
You can come to our place,
you can meet him there.
Okay I'll visit tomorrow
to meet him.
Okay now come I'll introduce you
to everyone.
Yes, please.
Come on.
Congratulations, congratulations,
congratulations to both of you.
We're done with the ceremony.
Bring your hand forward.
Congratulations.
Here, look at this pure 10 tolas.
10 tolas?
We've started this as well?
Life with me is a life of luxury.
Are you seeing this?
Showering her with gold
even before the marriage.
And then there is me,
generational daughter-in-law.
I long for the smallest things.
Hey, you didn't take anything?
Your plate is empty.
I'll get it, no I'll get it.
I'm eating it.
No, no, I'll get it.
Kebabs, fish kebabs.
Qorma is delicious.
No, no, I.
It’s delicious.
Have it.
I can’t eat all of it.
Taste it, take the fish kebabs,
here, here.
This, this is fish kebab, have it.
I’d only heard it till now that people
of Lahore are really welcoming,
I’m witnessing it now.
People of Lahore are very loving,
I mean when you live here you’ll realize
what I am trying to say.
Can I ask you something
if you don’t mind?
Do you have high standards?
Or low standards?
Or something in the middle?
What do you even mean?
I couldn’t understand.
I mean to ask, how can someone
reject a beautiful girl like you,
I’m sure you must’ve kicked off
everyone, right?
I can’t even understand,
I don’t get it.
You’re absolutely right.
I don’t have high standards,
but I hate selfish
and greedy people.
You’re right.
Do you know, all the proposals
I got till now,
all of them asked father, of his house,
properties, business, all of it.
Like there is no value for humans,
I really don’t like such people.
What a pious thinking you have,
the world is getting so materialistic,
people are hating other people
on the basis of their wealth.
People are greedy,
people are enemies of other people, right?
Have this, this qorma is delicious.
I’ve heard you haven’t married yet either,
so would you like to tell the reason?
Actually,
we have almost similar stories.
I’ve sent proposals,
they ask what does the guy do?
Whether or not he has a government job,
will he give a car to the girl,
does he have a green card or not.
Then it gets stuck on the fact that
