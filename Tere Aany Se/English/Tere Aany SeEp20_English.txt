Brother Mahir,
do you like her just like us?
What? Rania?
Why would I like her?
She's a witch.
I'm only taking her
so she could look after you.
Well I don't understand
how do you all enjoy her company,
she is so boring.
No?
Today will be so much fun.
Tipu said you called me?
What? I called you? Tipu.
He's lying,
the children were insisting
that we're going out
so we should to take sister Rania as well,
I said okay, why not.
Really?
I also have to shop for
uncle Dabeer's room,
so I'll shop as well.
Also, should I change or it's okay?
Change if you want to,
don't if you don't want,
why does it matter?
You won't get any attention among
the beautiful girls in this city.
Right children?
Children?
You're underestimating me.
You don't what Rania is.
People use my example in the village.
That means everyone in the village
is mad like you.
Everyone only talks according
to their brain capacity.
Let's go kids before he hears any more
appreciation from me.
Yes?
The cab is here, let's go.
Yes, itâ€™s the black gate.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, okay.
Well, where are we going?
You tell, where do you want to go?
I think, let's go to Dr. Wasiq's house.
We have to invite him to
Mona's engagement as well.
Yes sure, let's go.
And after that, we'll go to
sister Anjum's place, okay?
Yes.
And then Khawar, it's been so long
since we met him.
Oh yes, we have to meet him.
We're going for a children's outing Rania,
not for a meetup with your friends.
And children will be really bored looking
at Dr. Wasiq's face.
Right, kids?
If you had to do what you wanted
then why'd you ask?
Please forgive me,
I made a huge mistake.
Children, you tell,
where do you want to go?
Brother Mahir, let's go to the zoo.
No, no. It'll get really late,
I have to go shopping and
then I have to set uncle's room.
Yes I think she is absolutely right,
so let's do one thing,
we should go to the zoo.
Yay.
Oh God, what kind of useless people
I am stuck with.
Your father is returning,
do you care about that?
What kind of care,
you don't know my father,
he is very decent and simple.
He won't like a decorated room, relax.
Right?
Okay.
I think he's like my grandfather.
My grandfather is also very simple,
he doesn't like to show off.
Do you know,
even the most influential people
in my city are scared of him, yes.
Children, we'll go for ice cream
after the zoo.
Don't do this now,
it'll get pretty late.
Brother, drive fast, please.
Mano, careful.
Grandmother was telling me
about your father,
that he is not alive anymore.
Sorry,
but what was he like?
I'm sure you must've seen him.
I didn't see him,
I was very young when he died.
Oh, you must remember
something about him.
Hey, madam,
May god bless your pair,
give charity in your love's name.
What are you saying? Sorry,
we don't have any spare change.
Madam, stay happy,
May God bless you with a lot,
please give charity in his name.
I'm telling you we don't have any,
please leave.
Here you go, keep this money
and remember us in your prayers.
May God keep you both happy.
Why did you give her any money?
She was healthy.
We shouldn't be giving money
to such people.
It's okay, she was giving
so many well-wishes,
it made sense to pay her.
You tell,
how was your father?
Yes, I don't really remember much.
But yes, he was very educated,
he had a great job.
And he was really handsome,
it seems like you're like him.
Oh,
so that means,
you're finally admitting
that I am handsome after all.
Yes, God did bless you with a nice face.
Now I know what you are going
to say next,
physical beauty does not matter,
the real beauty is inner beauty, right?
Absolutely, physical appearance
doesn't last,
what matters is a person's morality
and his character.
All of these sound really good on Facebook
status and forward messages.
But in practical life.
Brother Mahir, brother Mahir,
do you know I saw a white tiger there.
Okay my child,
go forward there are more tigers.
Come with me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Hey.
I'm coming in a second.
Okay, now show, what is it?
Oh.
Are you blind? Can't you see?
Oh, sorry, my eyes squinted looking
at your beautiful face.
Really? Take off your glasses
it'll pop your eyes out.
At least tell us your name.
Tell us anything.
Tell me your Instagram id?
Give us your phone number?
Do I give you my shoe number?
Hey, she looks even cuter
when she's angry.
Get lost.
Don't you have any shame?
Hey, Mahir.
Hey, sorry brother,
I was just joking.
You are joking?
Ask for forgiveness.
Sister.
Ask for forgiveness.
Sister, sister please, I was kidding,
I swear to God.
Mahir
I swear to God I was joking sister.
Mahir, let him go.
He's a goon.
I'll kill you, get lost from here.
Mano.
What happened?
The kids are worried.
Sorry, I shouldn't have left you
alone like this.
It's fine.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Where is Tipu?
He's there.
Let's go.
Mother, I enjoyed it a lot,
it was too much fun.
It looks like only you had fun,
looking at him it seems like he had
to push the motorcycle to home.
Mother didn't have to push
the motorcycle
but I had to pull your daughter-in-law.
She did not want to go back home.
Oh mother, my back hurts mother,
I swear.
Where is Mahir, he didn't return yet
with the children.
Oh don't worry mother,
he will be back.
Okay I wanted to talk about something
very important.
Yes mother.
Listen, did Mona agree or not?
What if we do all the preparations and
then find out the girl doesn't agree?
Absolutely not.
What do you think mother,
this is possible?
Why can't this be possible?
She's your younger sister,
everything is possible.
In fact, sometimes I get scared
she doesn't cause a scene like you.
Listen,
you are responsible for this relationship,
do not embarrass me.
Rafique shouldn't think we're taking
a revenge for saying no to Rabail.
And also, get all the information
about Khawar,
it's a matter of a girl's life.
Mother, I am giving you my word,
I made this decision very wisely and
Mona is more understanding than me.
No matter how Khawar is,
she'll control him.
She's not innocent and
naive like me.
The kids have returned.
You got really late.
Where were you, grandmother
was getting worried.
Today we enjoyed a lot,
it was so much fun.
We didn't notice the time passing,
enjoyed a lot.
Kids did.
Yes, they were enjoying so much.
Okay, okay.
Okay mother, we're tired
now we're going to sleep.
Okay?
Go, go. Good night.
Change your clothes.
Grandmother, we're also tired,
we should also get fresh.
Go, go to sleep and rest.
Good night.
Listen, call Mona, and ask her.
Also, did your brother and sister-in-law
approved of this?
All of them agreed just the sister-in-law
as a little jealous type,
already making excuses
of fake sickness.
She got her gallbladder removed
10 years ago
and now she is saying she is having
some pain in the gallbladder.
I didn't think she'll allow brother.
First I was really sad that brother and
sister-in-law won't be there.
Then I thought, get lost,
I have my mother-in-law.
If you made me a part of your family
then my sister is also part of your family,
that's what respectable people do.
Yes, yes.
I'll go get my phone in 2 seconds
and make you talk to Mona
on a video call.
For your reassurance,
so you'd stop worrying.
I pity poor Khawar, pity.
Listen to me, we didn't force
this relationship,
it was Khawar and his father's choice.
And your wife,
she wholeheartedly wanted her sister
to get married to him.
So who are we to get
in between them?
Khawar isn't less than anyone,
I'm telling you.
Cunning people got more cunning people.
Mother, I'm a little tired, can I go?
Go, go away.
He's always tired.
Hey, this list doesn't have
Sarwat's name, we forgot.
Yes what's the name of her husband?
Shahrukh.
Oh no, the 3rd one.
No, not Shahrukh, what was it?
Fat something, no, Quddous.
Oh no, 3rd.
Yes, Shafeeq,
Shafeeq, yes.
He'll die as well.
What are you saying?
Mother, write all of my friend's names,
I'll invite all of my friends.
Oh no, they eat a lot,
don't invite them.
No, they eat a lot less than
your friends.
Remember mother, when brother
invited his friends over for Eid,
they ate everything,
there was nothing left for us to eat.
Stop it.
You always start your
own fight everywhere.
And here I am thinking
mother married off her other
granddaughter in a very rich family
that likes to show off,
people will compare our things
and gifts with theirs.
Then let them do it,
how does it matter to us,
right uncle?
What can I say, I have no experience
in such matters.
Everyone is getting married one by one
and then there is me,
my wedding flowers already withered,
already withered.
Uncle, we were talking about
such positive things,
couldn't you express your grief later?
We get cold from your cold sighs.
You didn't do good for me,
there must be a lot of teachers at your school,
some of them might be old,
some of them waiting to get married.
You never tried to talk about
your uncle's proposal?
How can you arrange
your son's wedding,
when your brother, when your
biological brother isn't married yet?
You are not thinking about me,
you are thinking about your son.
Don't worry, don't get disheartened,
I've talked to a lot of people,
you will definitely get married.
Yes I will, one day definitely,
when Farhad will be old and
his kids will be young.
And then they'll make memes on me,
they'll make memes on me with my wife.
An old man getting married
to a young woman.
And even the children
will make fun of me.
They'll do cyber-attacks on me,
they'll make videos on me for YouTube.
What are you talking about?
You are a little too far in the future,
in present I am getting married,
it's my wedding.
Focus on me.
So mother, tell me about the list.
I am just thinking if I leave someone out.
Write another name,
Razia Saleem.
She was my ex, and my boss's name.
Now they have 3 children together.
Visit whenever you want Rafique Ahmed,
this is like your own house.
Keeping guests, is a tradition
of our family.
We're respected people,
we feel happy while inviting people
and feeding them.
Yes.
Oh no, no, no,
I don't need anything,
everything is available here.
Okay then bring it,
if you're insisting so much.
You know those chocolates,
the ones that have purple wrapping.
Yes that one, bring that one only,
a kg or 2, nothing else.
Yes.
Okay then we're waiting for you.
So, this is also settled.
Yes?  Are you done with it?
Did you add the stitches to my shirt?
Yes about to.
What are you doing,
learning how to stitch?
Yes, yes grandmother,
I was learning how to stitch.
Mother, mother.
Yes?
Mona said yes.
Thank God, she said yes.
Listen, prepare some amazing tea,
Mona's in-laws and her groom
are coming over,
arrange tea for them.
You gave a really good news.
Mona has a small list of wishes that
she wants to give to Khawar.
Yes, why not, it'll be her right.
She should definitely give,
when one gets so much money
they spent on their wives.
I'll go and make tea.
Yes.
Grandmother,
hasn't Khawar been
visiting a lot lately?
He has a right.
Khawar is Mona's future husband,
yet he has a right to this house.
I am Mona's elder sister's husband,
yet nobody recognized
my right in this house.
Hammad, you don't use your arms or legs,
but you have been using a lot of brains
to think about such things.
Sorry, mother,
sorry.
Yes are you done?
Done with the stitch?
Yes, stitched.
Grandmother it seems like it is joint.
Yes, it is done.
Here you go sister,
your chocolates.
Rafique Ahmed,
thank you, thank you.
Is the purple one there?
Yes, yes, just saw it.
You brought so many.
That's nothing, sister.
Aww, thank you.
Where is Khawar?
He went to park the car,
he'll be back soon.
Here he comes.
What happened to him?
I think he sprinted his back,
why is he walking like that?
Khawar my child,
why are you so stiff?
It looks like you had a dip
in cold water.
My son's body got stiff.
No, grandmother there is
nothing like that.
Only the ones who are rich and
powerful walk with this attitude.
Father, you didn't tell them?
I did other deal on a property.
Yes, yes.
Congratulations Rafique Ahmed.
Congratulations.
It would be a really fortunate girl
who would come to my home
as my bride.
He is not even a son-in-law yet,
are you seeing his arrogance?
If he shows son-in-law's arrogance
then we'll turn it to dust as in-laws.
Do you want tea brother Khawar?
There is no need for tea Rania,
we should give him almond milk.
So his eyesight could improve and
he gets rid of these glasses.
You know about our Mona,
when she gets mad,
she throws things around.
And if he has weak eyesight,
then things will hit him on the head
and he will get injured.
Yes.
Yes, I'm worried, what will happen to him
if he gets a head injury?
This power, this way of life,
what will he do about it?
Listen to me Mr. Mahir,
I am about to get a LASIK surgery,
it's just a matter of a few days and
then I will get rid of these glasses.
Then you'll witness my attitude.
And about catching things, I have joined
a very expensive sports club,
I'll practice catching things from there.
Sports club? Uncle,
do they have another sports club
for dumb people?
Maybe.
Oh no, new times, new things.
And new businesses are thriving
because of dumb people like him.
Listen to me, I'm not dumb,
I'm an innocent boy and girls
are dying for this Innocence.
Well don't admire me so much,
brother Mahir won't be able to process it.
Father, tell them which hall did
we book for the engagement?
Hey show off,
first tell me are you here to
greet grandmother or to brag?
Father, everyone respects
money nowadays,
it is very necessary.
Who could understand
better than you?
And yes grandmother, I will choose
my own dress for the event.
Actually I don't understand
everyoneâ€™s stitching style,
so I have my personal tailor,
he's a little expensive
but works according to me.
You also have a choice.
The tailor must be the first one
to take his choice into consideration.
Father, look at them,
they are making fun of me.
Look, brother-in-law,
you're at your in-laws
so you'll get such treatment,
brother Rafique do you have
any objections?
No, no, my child I have no objection.
It's your thing,
use it however you want.
We also have to introduce you
to our friends, brother Khawar.
Oh, then mentally prepare
yourself for that before,
girls nowadays are very sharp,
they ruin such boys.
Father, father, what is he saying?
Calmly, uncle.
Don't insult our future son-in-law.
Look at him, he looks like
he's about to cry.
Oh, no, that's just
how he looks all the time.
Brother Khawar, I would suggest
on the day of the wedding,
hide your face with some accessories.
Because we don't know what people
will say, looking at your face.
Add fairy lights to
the accessories as well.
It'll look really good.
Write Eid Mubarak as well.
Father, are you listening,
to what they're saying?
Enjoy my child,
it's not easy to be a son-in-law,
the family who's giving their daughter
also makes fun of you.
See how lovingly
they're making fun of you.
Love?
Are you marrying or do I hit you?
I'll marry.
He's on track now.
Mother your tea with jaggery.
Live long, live long, live long.
Listen to me, how many days
are left in the engagement,
when will Mona arrive?
I talked to her this morning,
she's saying she'll reach
as soon as possible.
Okay then, that's a good thing.
Did you listen to
what Khawar had to say?
They're spending money like crazy.
So we will spend double
the amount of money.
Yes we will grandmother, why not,
weâ€™ll spend extravagantly.
Yes, good job, you made me happy,
I'm proud of you.
Well grandmother, call your son
and tell him,
the dollars he earned
while being in America,
when are we going to use them?
This is the time to show it off.
Grandmother, that day when
I talked to him about dollars,
he cut off the call,
talk to him about it.
No, no, he'll give, why won't he?
I'll talk to him.
Call him, I'll talk to him.
Grandmother, what happened?
We don't hurt ourselves if we look
at other people with a red faces.
If they're doing, let them spend
extravagant amounts,
but we shouldn't do that.
Hey Rania, you don't understand.
Grandmother, if she could, she'd ruin
our respect in front of them.
Don't listen to her.
Son, and daughter,
you can't understand all this.
It's ringing.
Stay on call.
Greetings brother Dabeer.
Greetings, father, hello?
Here, talk to mother.
Greetings.
Greetings, greetings.
Tell me how are your preparations
to return? Have you booked a ticket?
Mother, just assume
that I've gotten tickets,
I'll be at your feet very soon.
Here we have a competition
to show off wealth,
we're in need of a lot of money.
Can't back off.
Mother, businesses were
in a very bad place last year,
conditions here are not good.
You could go in loss,
it doesn't matter to me.
The matter is escalated here.
Your mother can't appear smaller
than Rafique, in front of people.
Listen, when you return this time,
bring your wife as well, that sweetie,
it's been 20 years and
we haven't seen her face.
Mother, leave her, what am I going
to do by bringing her here?
Are you kidding,
she's my daughter-in-law,
and she hasn't shown her face yet.
This time when you come,
bring sweetie with you
because we are done playing hide
and seek, just bring her here.
That, that, that.
Mother I forgot to tell you sweetie
got into a major accident.
Legs are fractured,
the bones are broken
at multiple points,
doctor advised her the bed rest
after giving her the plaster.
She cannot get up from her bed
for 6 months mother.
What? Did you hear that?
Your mother's legs broke.
How did it happen?
Oh God, then itâ€™s a compulsion.
Okay then let me talk to her,
so I could ask about her condition.
There is some disturbance in line,
we'll talk later.
What happened?
What happened?
The call ended.
What did you do?
I didn't even touch.
See, he disappeared.
Uncle? What are you doing?
Oh it's just water.
I'm drinking it to only leave
a little remaining.
So I could drown and die in it.
Amazing,
there is such a happy environment at home,
your nephew is getting married and
you're sitting here in such a sad mood.
You should've gotten a drum till now,
it would've been entertaining,
we'd enjoy.
Drums? You won't understand,
nobody can understand.
My 4 years younger,
3 and a quarter years younger nephew,
first got engaged now getting married.
Do you know what people are going to say?
Look, he is the same guy
whose nephew got married,
but he's still single.
But why am I telling all this to you,
you cannot understand my feelings,
I can understand,
I can absolutely understand,
in fact, I am mad at myself I don't know
why did I not understand earlier,
but don't worry now.
Getting you married is
now my responsibility.
See, don't forget.
Is it even something to forget?
I will get you married as many times
as you want.
Okay now get up,
let's go inside,
we should talk to them as well,
they don't care.
Uncle is sitting outside like orphan.
Come on, get up.
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Wonderful, nobody cared about uncle.
I mean outside, he was lying outside,
drinking water
and nobody was there
to ask him anything?
What happened?
What happened is that he should have
been married twice by now,
he should have had 4 children by now.
Listen to me,
a nephew getting married before uncle?
Wonâ€™t you be embarrassed?
No, no, why are you spoiling my plan?
Listen to me.
What do I listen,
your heart didn't say anything when
you were being cruel to this innocent man?
Take a breath,
listen to me.
I won't listen to anything,
you listen to me.
Aunt? Aunt,
I'll call grandfather today,
and tell him to tell
the women in the village
to find a girl for uncle,
we want an urgent proposal, right now.
In fact, give me your phone,
I'll call him right now.
Hey, listen to us, take a seat.
How can I calmly take a seat?
Come on, look at this innocent face,
look at these eyes, so full of greed,
I mean desires,
so full of wishes, look.
Ayaz? You didn't tell Rania?
How many proposals
have I brought for you,
how many times have I tried
for your relationship,
and you rejected all of them.
If you're still a bachelor then itâ€™s your fault.
Rania, he has an inverted brain,
he does not like any proposal.
Oh, so is that so?
Okay then, we'll find a girl,
when we find the perfect girl we'll just inform
him, there is no need to involve him, okay?
What happened, what are you saying?
Be quiet,
family searches for a good proposal,
good boys don't interrupt.
Do you understand?
Okay then, we'll look for a girl.
Now be happy,
she called you a boy.
Hey, why did you come here?
Oh, why did I come and
what did you distract me with.
Farhad, grandmother is calling you,
we'll decide on your wedding outfit.
Grandmother said the outfit should be so good,
nobody could take eyes off it.
Mona's engagement and your wedding
with be celebrated on a grand scale, okay?
Okay, okay.
Come fast, she's waiting.
Did you see?
Sister?
Sister?
When will I get my dress?
Let me look for your bride first.
I'm asking for the event.
See mother,
I donâ€™t know anything,
I want a gold jewelry set.
And a very heavy and
amazing wedding dress.
Wow.
I want people to stare at me
when I walk.
And itâ€™ll be your greatness.
And if itâ€™s not up to the mark,
then my in-laws will get the taunts
that mean you and your family.
No, no taunts, I canâ€™t take any insults,
itâ€™ll be really embarrassing.
Call Mahir, Iâ€™ll give him the money then
you can shop for anything you like.
There is nothing greater than a
personâ€™s respect and reputation.
Mother, explain this clearly to Mahir,
to not be stingy in my matters.
Iâ€™m going to call him.
Grandmother, what is happening?
It seems like either you have a well
for money or that alien Khawar has.
So much waste of money?
On daughter-in-laws sister?
Sheâ€™s also like our daughter,
and daughterâ€™s sister like also
a part of family.
Grandmother, let me explain.
Rania, see, these are the matters
of wealthy households,
let me handle it.
Grandmother,
weâ€™ll not get a better chance to prove
that our family is richer
then Khawarâ€™s family.
Yes.
And weâ€™re not misers,
we spend wholeheartedly.
Yes, yes.
Mother, thatâ€™s how you make
an impact on people.
When the brideâ€™s sister will be wearing
the most expensive outfit.
Else everything is okay.
But grandmother, such expense
on just an engagement?
Grandmother, if you have taken
the responsibility of Monaâ€™s wedding,
then you should not back off.
No, no, why would I back off?
Yay.
Thatâ€™s like a man.
Then listen to me,
Iâ€™ll come to this event wearing
casual clothes.
Iâ€™ll see whoâ€™s going to throw me
out of the venue,
or how will my respect decrease.
Grandmother, what is she saying?
Explain it to her.
I am already telling you,
do not try to talk to me.
What a doom,
the tradition that can be carried out by
feeding 2 sweets and enjoying on music,
why would you spend
so much money on that?
Iâ€™ve made my mind,
before anything else,
Iâ€™ll get this show-off banned.
What, what, what?
Youâ€™ll get it banned?
You? How?
Why do I tell you she could put
an evil I on it?
Grandmother, I think she has already
planned on the wedding day,
sheâ€™ll climb the electric pole
and protest.
Just keep watching,
Iâ€™ll hang the people from the pole,
the ones who waste money.
Just waiting for my time.
Leave her, mother, ask Mahir,
when is he going to give me money
so I could go and shop?
Why would I give the money?
Father was going to send the money.
Grandmother, call father.
Iâ€™ll call him, but Seema Iâ€™m wondering,
where is Mona?
I hope it doesnâ€™t happen that the whole venue
is prepared and the bride doesnâ€™t arrive.
God, itâ€™ll be so much fun if it happens,
your show-off will go down the drain.
No, God forbid, no, no.
Donâ€™t say this, theyâ€™re already going,
go shop with them, for my sake.
Wonâ€™t you make me happy?
Go get a dress or two,
and some small jewelry, go,
go, my child.
Grandmother.
Go, Iâ€™m telling you,
go for my sake,
go and shop.
Now she must be thinking
how many people could get groceries
and how many of their needs
met with this money.
These poor people always have
eyes on othersâ€™ money,
now what do we do?
Wear rags?
We should give away our clothes,
our money, our everything?
Are we a non-profit organization?
Yes obviously, youâ€™re such a rich
and wealthy familyâ€™s heir,
and your husband, a millionaire,
billionaire, or Prince Saleem?
How can you understand
poor peopleâ€™s problems?
You only know
how to insult others.
Mother, tell him,
Iâ€™m going to get my bag,
take me to shopping.
Yes, yes.
Listen, buy her whatever she asks for.
And also get some things for Rania.
Okay?
Where is Rabail? Who you went to bring.
She is not coming letâ€™s go.
At least tell me where we are going.
To the same mall where you buy

Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You are leaving without me, God Iâ€™m dead.

It took me two seconds to get changed
and you were leaving without me.
You are also coming with us?

First decide who wants to come,

Mahir, what route is this?
This a shortcut aunt.
I didnâ€™t have much time
to take the long route
Look at those people,
their bike broke down,
go and help them.
They show should fix it
on the side,
not in the middle of the road.
Hey stop.
No, no, no, no.
They look like snatchers

What are you looking
at hide your phone.
They are dacoits.
Give us everything.
I swear I have nothing,
all of this is artificial,
bought everything on sale
I have nothing.
Donâ€™t try to be over smart,
is this your age to joke?
Quick, give me everything.
Old lady?
He called me an old lady.
Stay quiet let me handle this.
Take out.
You coward, why are you
pointing your gun at him,

Roll over the windows.
Take out everything.
Donâ€™t you have any shame,

at a woman?
If you are a real man then come here
and talk to me.

You keep going there.

easily, calmly.
Donâ€™t shoot, weâ€™ll give,

Brothers, she is crying for so long
and you didnâ€™t even ask
that why is she crying?
You couldâ€™ve asked as a fellow human,
all Muslims are brothers and sisters,
did you ask, why is she crying?
What do we tell?
We have already been robbed
on the last stop,
there were two evil, I mean,
needy people like you,
took everything from us.
They didnâ€™t leave us with anything,
we have to travel a very long way
to meet his sick mother
and we donâ€™t have money for fuel.
Poor people donâ€™t have
such luxurious car.
You were also fooled by the car,
this car doesnâ€™t belong to us.
Take off your glasses.
Look at his face he looks like
Muneeb butt,
only from his face
otherwise he is poor,
his jacket, shoes, everything is thrifted,
he is a very poor man.
Are you mad?
Stop your nonsense.
And her? You have already
called her an old lady,
she doesnâ€™t even have a phone, no wonder
how she talks to her husband at night.
Now look at my health,
compare me to yourself,
and tell me who is poor?
Sorry sister,
your story made me very sad,
here take this 500 rupees for fuel,
go, may you have a safe journey.
Just 500?
Thatâ€™s all we could rob since morning.
Thank you so much brothers,
remember your sister in your prayers,
and may God give you success
in your business.
Amen.
Come on, letâ€™s go before
another one comes.
You two listen to me,
all this happened
because of my good deeds.
Thank God that I was with you.
I have memorized their faces,
if I ever find them without guns
I will beat them very badly.
Bloody blinds,
calling me an old lady.
Five Thousand,
Oh God,
is everything this expensive?
Rania, come here
Yes.
How is the dress?
Very nice, for who?
For you.
For me?
Yes.
I wonâ€™t wear such an expensive dress,
Iâ€™ve stopped buying expensive things.
Where is the tag? It is not that expensive,
it must be around 3000-4000.
Here is the tag,
itâ€™s of nine thousand.
So buy it.
He is being so kind you should take it,
why are you being so stubborn?
Kind? No, no,
I am not being kind.
She is our guest,
if she doesnâ€™t wear anything good,
we will be insulted
thatâ€™s why I am saying
she should buy it.
I am not responsible for your nose
Fine,
you have already decided that
you want to get grandmother insulted
but I am not going to let that happen.
I will buy anything of my choice for you.
You are very stupid,
if he would have offered me, I would have
asked for two instead of one,
he has the habit of
only spending on himself.
Daughter-in-law of the house.
