Yes, Mona.
No need to worry about anything, child.
You get all sorts vehicles for hire
outside the Lahore station.
Hire anything and come over.
The engine has failed.
It will take more time?
That is good.
No, I mean nothing to worry about, child.
The train is parked in the jungle?
Then enjoy the jungle, child.
Come on.
Okay. Okay. We will talk again.
The train engine has failed,
so the train will reach in the morning.
Okay, did I have food?
Yes, I did. I am going to sleep now.
Don’t disturb me, okay?
Eat food, sleep.
Wake up, eat food and sleep.
Are you not disturbed with your own life?
What is wrong?
Why are you shouting so much?
I am lying near you.
After all, now Mona coming over
is going to be useless.
here you go, tell her not to come.
Tell her to get off the train and
get the train on the other side. Here.
Your stubborn, beloved, lovely, arrogant
nephew is in love with some other girl.
Yeah?
Oh, okay. Okay.
What are you staring at me for?
What fault do I have?
No, Hammad, you have no fault.
It is all my fault. I had seen a dream
that I will rule this entire home.
I was the one who dreamed
that for the first time in your life
you will get off this bed
and rule this home as the owner.
With you alive,
no change will come in my life.
God knows when he will wake up.
Oh my drama grandma, you turned
out to be a great actor, my love.
You know to tell you the truth,
I had no hope,
but you acted so well.
Amazing.
You were even better than
Sabiha Khannum.
You know, grandma,
if Rania was not there,
then this wouldn’t have happened.
All credit goes to Rania.
Thank you Rania.
No worries, buddy.
It was responsibility.
Shall we go now
or is there someone else
whose issues you have to resolve?
Come on.
No, its done.
It is enough for today.
You did something great today.
Yes, what else?
Now come on.
I am coming. I will go, then.
Okay, bye, bye, Rania.
Okay, take care of yourself, bye.
You too, Ifrah. Bye.
Okay, aunty, I too will leave.
I will come tomorrow.
Yes, I too will come tomorrow.
Okay? Bye. Come on.
Grandma!
I still don’t believe it.
What happened? Stop at least.
What happened?
Are you not happy with their proposal?
Are you also in love with Ifrah?
You just realized it.
If you want, I can get the proposal cancelled,
you give it a shot.
Quiet. Absolutely quiet.
Don’t guess too much about me.
And you don’t even talk to me.
Why? Listen to me.
Why are you so jealous of my success?
Hey, if God has made me smarter than you,
then what is my fault in this?
Who told the hospital staff that
you are my fiancée?
Oh, okay, so this is the matter.
Okay stop. Stop.
Stop these dramas.
I know everything.
You stop dreaming with open eyes.
These dreams of yours will
never turn into reality.
Oh wow, you are badly mistaken.
Man, I am not interested in hitting
the foot with an axe.
Salik’s mother liked me,
she was planning to ask
for my proposal,
which is why I had to say this.
And even if by mistake your family
tries to fix this proposal,
I will give you poison
but I will not get married.
Understand?
He thinks so highly of himself.
Come on, now.
Be quiet damn it.
Be quiet.
Oh wow, she is such an amazing girl,
she gets frank with everyone quickly.
He is ready to do everyone’s work immediately.
But her fiancé,
I found him to be really rude.
Hey, what fiancé?
How is he her fiancé?
Hey, he is not her fiancé.
He is her cousin
What? Really?
Actually, Salik’s mother wanted
to get Irfah and Mahir married.
Okay,
so this is the deal.
Ayaz, when you meet her,
you too will be really happy.
Yes. Yes, absolutely.
Once Laraib gets fine,
we will go meet Rania directly.
Brother, I am absolutely fine.
Please take me home
Child, you are absolutely fine
in our eyes.
Look, you are really unwell
in the eyes of the hospital.
This hospital is on sister’s office panel,
so the doctors are saying three
to four more tests are left.
Enjoy.
Ayaz, you be quiet.
Yes, we will surely go to their home.
Rania has done us a big favour bringing
Laiba to the hospital in time.
Yes, yes, mama, you will be
really happy going there,
because a lot of other good people
live there. Right, uncle?
Not uncle. Ayaz.
Okay, Mr. Ayaz,
you know how good women live there,
really well mannered, pretty.
Hey, I didn’t see anyone who could be
my match there, as such.
Sister, we have come
to such weird times,
the time of widows and
divorcees are getting over.
Oh.
You don’t lose hope.
You are not that old.
You will find someone your match.
You will. Laiba, am I right?
I don’t know, I want to go home.
Are the nurses on strike?
I think I will ask nurse Rebecca.
Excuse me, madam Rebecca.
She knows the entire procedure.
Rebecca.
Madam Rebecca.
Excuse me.
Mano, Tipu, how many times
do I have to call you people?
I will drag you inside.
This is the limit.
Mama, just a little while.
No.
Oh no.
Hey, sister Rania is here.
Hello childrens.
Sister Rania,
where did you go?
Oh, it is a long story,
I will sit and tell you comfortably.
Today, I did something good.
Come inside, I will tell you.
Hey, Ifrah’s grandma acted so well
on my direction.
If you people were there
you would have surely praised me.
Ifrah’s grandmother was lying on the bed
as a sculpture of sympathy.
But that Salik’s mother turned out
to be really stone-hearted.
She wasn’t agreeing.
Hey, even I am hungry.
Shehanshah get food for me as well.
Shehanshah quickly heat the food
and bring it for her.
Then, what happened next?
Yes, then...
Hey, I will tell you what happened then.
She lied so much, praising Ifrah...
You, focus on your food.
It is not necessary to speak
in every matter.
Hey, when did I lie?
I just made Salik’s mother realize
that Ifrah’s her son’s choice
and she should be careful
about her son’s liking.
Tell me, what is wrong in that?
Yes, then she got insulted so badly,
I really enjoyed it.
Ifrah’s mother told her,
who are you to interfere
in the matter of our home.
And she didn’t get embarrassed
she said she is Salik’s friend,
Mahir, that is my future wife.
What?
Such a big lie.
Mahir, tell me honestly
did she really say that?
No, no, aunt, I...
Yes, the moment she said it
the whole staff of the hospital came
to sympathise with me.
They say, man,
we are really sorry,
your life is over before it started.
She is your future wife?
Hey, it was me,
I handled the situation.
I told them we fixed the proposal
in the family’s pressure.
I won’t marry her.
So, when am I dying to marry you?
I told you, I said to handle the situation.
But no, he will tell this to everyone
again and again, on purpose.
To feel good about himself that such a
beautiful girl got ready to marry him.
Beautiful?
Have you ever seen your face
in the mirror?
She looks like the straw in
an empty bottle, right?
It was funny, man.
She has turned everyone towards her
A person suffering from inferiority complex
is actually suffering from mental illness.
Such a person hides their true self
and tries to portray themselves
as something that they are not.
Such a person should be tackled
like a patient with sympathy.
Our Mahir turned out to be someone
suffering for mental illness.
These statements he makes
praising himself,
it is actually his inferiority complex.
I couldn’t understand something so small.
From today I will deal with him
the same way it is written in this book.
Come on, Rania,
you will become the prime minister,
try to an expert psychiatrist
for a few days.
Finish it quickly.
Who eats a sandwich with
a spoon and fork?
Eat properly.
Hey, Mahir, listen,
please drop the children to school.
They are getting late.
Why?
Where is their father?
Okay.
They will go themselves.
There is nothing like
that you clearly refused,
now someone had to go
pick up my poor Mona.
This means that Mona...
Mona has come.
yes.
Be quick brother will drop you
at school. Be quick.
I am not dropping anyone,
anywhere.
I have a lot of work to do.
I have to go to the hospital
to meet Ifrah’s grandma,
then I have to go to university as well.
I have a lot of other things
to do as well. I am not available.
Book a cab, and drop them yourself.
You know, no child should
get a brother like you.
Why do you worry aunt?
The bike is at home,
I will go drop the children.
What do you, children?
Hey, yes.
I had forgotten children,
we have the aunty who likes serving
humanity presents in our home.
You do one thing,
first drop the children
to school on the bike,
then drop Rabail to college.
After that, go to meet Ifrah’s grandmother
and Farhad’s sister.
And..and..and...see if there is
something needed at home,
then go and get it as well.
Okay?
She thinks she will sort
the matters of the home,
she doesn’t understand that
she is the biggest issue.
She thinks so highly of herself.
Now
I don’t get upset at anything you say.
In fact, I sympathize with you.
You can say anything to me,
I won’t mind. I swear.
You didn’t get the love of parents
in childhood that’s why...
What?
What are you saying?
Hey, I know it all.
You do all this to hide your lacking
from the world,
you have a new mask
on your face often.
I know it all.
I have understood the sorrow inside you.
Lacking? Sorrow?
Have you gone mad?
Are you dreaming?
You are saying weird things.
Come on, children come.
I will drop you to school.
What if she sleeps riding a bike,
we will face a loss.
Sleep properly at night.
Okay, breakfast?
Sorrow inside.
Drive carefully.
Lunch. Okay eat this.
Don’t you give him a lunch box?
What will he eat when
he goes to the university?
Wear a helmet
when riding the bike.
All of them are the same in this home.
I don’t know what
he will eat at the university.
Okay, I will go outside
and start the bike.
Where is Saman?
In her room
Hey, the problems of that girl don’t end.
Now if her husband is not coming to get her,
she will keep on mourning?
What will Seema think?
Her sister is coming
and Saman is not happy?
There is really no happiness, mama.
She is a weird woman.
She says things, insults people and
when you respond, she gets upset.
Okay, she is coming for a few days,
tolerate it.
Where is Hamad?
He left in the morning to get them.
The train must have gotten late,
what else?
Hey child, what are you doing?
The maid will do it, you leave it.
Mama, I am bored of sitting idle.
I don’t know when
my admission will be open.
I am not used to sitting idle.
Oh my love…
Oh…oh, mama.
Careful. Careful.
Put it down. Put it down.
She has brought the entire home.
Okay, she is here.
Mama. Mama. Mona is here.
Huh? Where is she?
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
Oh hello grandma.
Greeting. Greetings.
Are you fine, child?
How was your journey?
My journey was really good,
just like me,
but the train got a little late,
but no problem.
Come on. Come on.
Have a seat. Sit down.
Shehanshah, get some juice.
Come on.
So this is Rania?
You had made so much noise for no reason.
She is no beauty queen.
I will run her over with my style.
Greetings.
Greetings.
How are you Rania?
I am fine
Sister praised you a lot
Really?
and Rabail you?
I am fine too.
You look really pretty,
and I don’t see the rest of the people.
The kids have gone for tuition.
No, she is not talking about the kids,
she is talking about Mahir,
they have good understanding.
What? Really?
Then you did good
that you came.
Mama, call Mahir, tell him Mona is here,
he should come quickly.
Actually he needs a good friend
a lot right now.
Rania, stay quiet for some time,
you don’t know anything right now.
I am finding out everything,
that’s why.
Rania, please be quiet,
you really don’t know anything.
Why are you tired like this? Huh?
Did you push the train?
I am tired lifting the luggage.
All of you leave it, I will call Mahir.
Should I call him?
No, leave it, sit.
What?
Mona is here.
So? What do I do?
Really? Don’t act so much.
I know well how good an understanding
you two have.
You know I thanked God she came.
With her coming over, you will get
liveliness in your sad life.
You instead of spitting fire,
will smile.
Sad life? Mine?
Why?
Has my lover left me
and run away?
Don’t say these stupid things about me.
Sad life.
And one more thing,
you are not writing a book on me,
so if you express your feelings,
then I will forget that you are a relative
of my grandma’s beloved brother,
whatever you are.
Understand?
Deprivations have made you
really bitter.
I feel that the inferiority complex
is really deep.
But no problem, I understand,
I will fix it.
Uncle is usually
at home all day long,
but right now he had to take the bike.
We could have easily gone on his bike.
So, it is fine, we will take a rickshaw from
the corner of the road and go quickly to the mall.
What is the tension?
Okay, listen, don’t take too long.
I don’t enjoy this shopping at all.
It won’t take time at all.
I will get some things for myself,
a birthday gift for my friend and
we will quickly come back.
Sure?
Yes, sure. I promise.
Fine, then.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
I have a complaint from you.
From me? Why?
What did I do?
You didn’t even come to the hospital
to ask about my sister’s health.
I… I…
I had sent Rania,
she visits often.
But I was waiting for you.
Err…
now how would this poor thing know
that you are waiting for her. Huh?
Okay, we are in a hurry,
we will meet again. Okay? Bye.
Okay.
We will come to your home soon.
Why?
Now what does he want?
Why would he come to our home?
I don’t know, we will come back
and think about it. Come on.
Come, lets check out these shoes.
Hey, we get such shoes
in Khushalpur as well.
Are you the same person who has a shop
in the big market in Khushalpur?
Yes.
He is the same. I told you.
You get it, he will give a discount.
You will give us a discount, brother?
Man, I am tired Rabail. Stop it.
Let’s go home, come on.
Let me get some make up from here…
No. No. No. No. I am hungry,
I want to eat something.
See, coffee. Lets do one thing,
let’s get coffee and cupcakes. Okay?
Yes, okay.
Come, we will have coffee from here.
Okay, they also have really good
sandwiches.
Come here. Come.
Check this. Okay…
Rania.
Rania.
What happened?
Where were you?
I have been looking for you for so long.
Come on, don’t you want to have coffee?
You were so hungry and
now you have come here.
Come on.
Greetings.
Did she lose her phone and
purse on gun point?
She went inside really quietly.
She is not that innocent.
Nothing like that happened.
She was fine when leaving home,
she was also okay in the mall,
suddenly something happened there
and she got in a bad mood.
I have been asking her for so long,
but she is not telling me anything.
She got in a bad mood,
going to the mall.
Oh, I got it.
Poor thing.
What do you mean?
What did you understand?
Obviously, you must be
shopping in the mall.
You must have got expensive things,
you must have eaten,
the poor thing must have felt
a lot seeing you.
That is why she has the long face.
No, there is nothing like that.
When I was shopping,
she was looking at me surprised
that why I am buying such
cheap things so expensive.
Yes, that is obvious, so that
you find out that she felt it.
Rabail,
why are you sitting here, idle?
Please, will you go teach the children?
I am unable to handle them at all.
Please.
Fine.
I will keep these things and
take care of the children.
Yes, quickly.
When did you come?
And why do you watch
such boring things?
Put on a good movie,
both of us will watch it together.
Yes, movie.
Yes.
We should put on a movie.
Good idea.
Fine, I will go to my room and
put on a good movie.
Yes, but I too want to watch it with you.
Please, wait.
If my papa was alive,
then he would have been this age.
That man was just like my papa.
Who was he?
How can he look
so much like my father?
Papa doesn’t even have a brother,
no relative, no friends,
I should have met him.
I should have talked to him,
I should have asked who he is.
I made such a big mistake, man.
Now where do I look for him?
Listen.
Listen to me.
Since I have come here,
you didn’t even talk to me properly.
I don’t know how to talk properly,
that is why I talk less. You too try it.
Meaning?
Do I not talk properly?
Hey, you have become really smart.
Do you even know how far I have come
from and that too only for you.
Why?
Can I know the reason
for such a big favour?
You were not like this earlier,
you have changed a lot,
you have become really weird.
Please become like you were earlier.
Please.
Mona, when did I used to take you
for lunch and dinner earlier?
Or we used to go on a long drive?
Wow. Long drive?
Good idea. Shall we go?
I will go get ready and come.
Ready?
Yes.
You will be ready further?
For God’s sake Mona,
you put on so much make up
on your face,
how does your skin breathe?
You don’t breathe with your skin,
you breath with your mouth, idiot.
Hello.
Yes, Ifrah, hey,
you are still in the hospital?
Hmmm…sister was absolutely right,
this Rania is a a magician.
Seeing her face,
he doesn’t know the worth
of my branded makeup.
But I too won’t leave him,
I will teach him a lesson.
What?
Grandma wants to meet Rania?
You mean to say,
grandma is missing Rania?
Not just missing her,
she is missing her badly.
Oh my God,
this means that grandma’s condition
is really critical.
The medication has directly
affected her mind.
You go, get the medication changed
by the doctor, immediately.
What? What do you mean?
I mean, hey, Rania,
she is so irritating,
how can someone miss her?
I mean, can some long to meet her?
It is impossible.
No, she is a really good girl,
she is really sweet,
even I want to meet her.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Now tell me what you think of me.
Please, man, Ifrah,
I am so shocked.
I am surprised.
You be shocked,
but do bring Rania tomorrow.
Understand? Bye.
How can I… bye.
They have all gone mad.
Mahir, isn’t that Rania?
What is she doing alone
in the garden?
Hey, this is Rania grandma,
she has a license for madness.
Even if she hangs upside down
from the tree,
then you don’t worry.
You sit calmly.
It is late in the evening,
and the weather is changing,
you go and see what she is doing.
Hey, grandma nothing will happen to her.
I am anyway, playing an important game.
I am telling you to go.
Fine, I will go because you are asking me.
What is this problem!
Grandma is worried.
What happened?
I mean, what are you doing
sitting here so late?
Tell her I will come in a while,
don’t worry.
She is not worried about you.
She is worried that the ghosts and
monsters that live on these trees for years,
their children might get scared of you
and runaway.
More than mama
I feel you are worried for them.
Are you in love with a witch?
Oh God, forgive me.
Never bring such a bad time in my life
that I have to love her.
Do I look like a witch?
Just cause Mona came in your life,
you like to joke around all the time
You don’t look like a witch,
you are a witch.
Child, why are you walking around
alone in the garden?
Look, the weather is changing
you might fall ill.
Mama, the weather has changed.
The one who used to frown
all time are now always smiling.
Hey the life of people has changed.
Their life is full of spring.
Come on, come inside. Come on.
Come.
Come. I came after you.
Oh, you have such a long face.
You are disappointed like
you don’t know about him.
He is like that, stubborn and annoyed.
If you know his temperament is
stubborn and annoyed,
then why have you given me hope?
First he had a lot of tantrums,
he didn’t give me any lift,
he had a lot of pride. But now,
now he is in love with someone.
And now he is so in love seeing
that villagers washed face,
that he doesn’t like my face.
My make up!
Did Mahir say something?
Not something,
he said a lot and on top of that
he made fun of me.
Oh, so this is the matter.
Look Mona,
this girl is really cunning.
Like a cunning vixen.
She has the whole family
in the palm of her hand.
We have to break her magic,
I am telling you.
We don’t have to give up.
We will degrade her in Mahir’s eyes.
But how?
Both us sisters will sit
and plan something.
Whatever you want to do,
do it quickly.
I don’t have time.
And whatever time is left,
I don’t want to waste it on him.
There the contractor’s poor son
is waiting for me there.
Now I don’t want to miss
my other chance for him.
Damn you, Mona.
Here, I have found a prince like boy for you
and you are dreaming about the stupid,
illiterate son of the contractors.
Don’t mention him in front of me again.
Understand?
Mahir correctly made fun of you.
Look at your level.
Your standard has fallen so low.
Hey, I didn’t say he is my prince charming.
I have just kept him in reserve.
For God’s sake be quiet.
If someone hears us,
then I don’t know about you,
but I will be really embarrassed.
Okay fine, but tell me
what will you do now and how?
I will tell Mahir that the kids are insisting
on eating ice cream,
I will stop the kids at the last moment,
you go with him.
That’s what I am talking about. Fine,
I will quickly go and get ready.
Oh God, Mona, how much
more will you dress up?
Oh man,
everyone has an issue with my makeup.
I am used to living in a modern lifestyle
and I cannot change myself for anyone.
I will go touch up. Okay, bye.
She is really stubborn.
Come in.
Irfah called yesterday,
her grandma has sent
a message for you.
I am sure she sent her greetings.
Greetings from me to her as well.
There is something greater
than the greetings.
She has been impressed
by your buttering.
She wants to be inspired
by your smartness.
She has called you to meet her.
Really?
I will surely go to meet her.
I am leaving for the hospital.
You have half an hour,
get ready and come
or else I will leave.
Why half an hour?
I will just come.
Okay, then.
He is leaving her room,
he doesn’t even come to my room.
Be quiet.
Are you ready?
Yes, for so long.
Mahir.
Mahir. Mahir.
Listen to me.
See, since my Mona has come,
she is locked up at home,
take her out for ice cream.
Aunt, right now I am going to the hospital.
Mona, why don’t you do one thing,
go out with uncle and aunt for ice cream.
This way the kids will also have it too.
It is a nice idea.
Come on. Come on.
are really late .
Thank you so much for your advice.
Cool. Cool. Stay cool.
You will sit in front all your life.
I wanted to go.
I will make such a plan that
you will be with her all your life.
Come on, come inside now.
The sun is shining hard,
we will get tanned.
Oh, I don’t believe it,
Ifrah and her grandma asked for me.
Hey, madam Rania,
you have no idea about your qualities.
Hey, you have such a personality
that if a person meets you once,
and they don’t meet you again,
it is not possible.
Huh? Really?
Yes, yes, what do you think?
I am lying to you?
You have an amazing personality.
You have so much knowledge
that once someone talks to you,
he is unable to survive without
benefitting from your learnings
Don’t praise me so much.
Hey, I am right
In fact, I think a book should be
written on your life. Huh?
Yes, and the title of the book will be,
legends of Rania Jutt.
You are riding on a horse
and approaching, you say,
Rania doesn’t die till Rania kills Rania.
Go ahead, speak up, what happened?
why did you get quiet?
Speak up, come on. I want to benefit
from your learnings.
You are mistaken and badly mistaken.
Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome.
Greetings, how are you?
I am absolutely fine,
but you have a long life.
I was just thinking about you.
I was thinking of taking your number
from Ifrah and call you.
I was really missing you talking
and your innocent face.
Oh, hi hero.
He too has come along.
Hey, he doesn’t leave you alone.
Hey, you should give him a
one hour class daily.
Hey teach him to laugh and smile.
He is really different
from your personality.
I will go meet grandma.
By the way, the boy is really good,
but isn’t he a little stubborn?
You will have to work a little hard
and this flaw will also be removed.
Why would I work hard?
His wife will come, she will fix him.
What?
You two are not engaged?
Who said this to you?
I was thinking something else.
Okay, right now
I am going to meet grandma,
when I come back,
I will give you my number.
You can call me when you want.
Okay?
You are so cute yourself.
I will come
You have something, I made all this
myself and brought it for you.
Hey, you made so many things?
Why so much formality, sister?
Hey, there is no formality.
Okay come, have these oats.
Taste it. This is really good for you.
So many things.
I don’t know where Rania is,
she has not come till now.
She has made so many relatives
in the hospital.
She must be busy talking to someone.
She will come in a while.
Hey, what do I tell you
about that child?
She is not our blood,
we have no relation with her,
but it feels she is my own blood.
It seems like she is
my own granddaughter.
Why? Because of her good behaviour.
What else?
You are right.
Hey Mahir, you are really lucky.
Yes?
Yes, thank you.
Child, you don’t find such a good girl
in today’s time, even if you search.
You are right.
You are absolutely right.
I have had enough.
Aunty, I will tell you
that I am not the lucky one…
Mahir.
This…
this bottle…I am unable
to open its cap.
What is the bottle that you are unable
to remove the cap from it?
You wanted to ruin all our efforts?
Really?
And what about how you people have
connected that useless girl’s name with mine?
Can you not tolerate it for a while?
Tolerate it for me and Salik.
After all, she is not that bad.
She is a really good girl.
Now if you say another word
praising her,
then I will tell everyone the truth.
Greetings.
Greetings.
How are you?
Live long. Stay happy.
How are you?
I am fine, we were just talking
about you.
How are you feeling?
I am much better, thank God.
It is such a good coincidence that
I came and you people are also here.
We got to meet each other.
Yes, I was just saying this to Mahir,
that he really lucky that
he got a life partner like you.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Yes. Yes,
Mahir is lucky in every matter.
Yes, absolutely.
She is right aunty.
I am so lucky that I got engaged
to her in childhood.
Luck knocked on my door in childhood.
Hey, so she is your fiancée
since childhood?
Mahir, why did you not tell us
this earlier?
He did. He told us many times.
He told me and Salik several times.
Right, Salik? He told us, right?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
He has even asked me to ask mama
to fix my wedding date.
I cannot wait anymore.
Mahir,
whether you invite us to
your wedding or not,
we will all surely come.
Sure. Sure.
Sure, do come
Hey child, see this.
Taste it.
I made all this with my hands
and brought it.
Really?
