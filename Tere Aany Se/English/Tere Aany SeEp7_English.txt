Come on, come in.
Come in. Come in.
Shehanshah.
Shahenshah.
Go call your sir Mahir,
his friends are here.
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Come on.
You people come sit comfortably.
Right now,
Mahir will wake up,
he will take out his branded clothes,
get them ironed,
wear them and come.
By the way, you are his friends,
why don’t you make him understand?
Hey, for a friend a friend is dear,
not his branded clothes.
Er…
you are right, but…
Hi guys, what’s up?
Hey you people had come over,
you should have told me earlier.
I would have come sooner.
How are you?
Buddy, we thought
we would surprise you,
but you are dressed up in a way
that maybe you are going somewhere.
Hey, this is my swag.
I stay this way at home too.
With style.
What are you doing standing here?
We have guests over,
make arrangements for tea for them.
Sure.
Go.
Who is this girl?
Is she a relative?
Relative?
Hey, she is my servant,
she works at home.
She and my relative?
I am not going through such a bad time.
Hey, to be my relative,
a person should have class,
they should have some standard.
Greetings aunt.
Hello. Rania.
How are you?
I am not good.
Huh?
What happened?
Is everything fine?
I am coming back.
You people talk,
I am coming.
What are you saying?
I said I am coming back.
Oh man,
I am dead.
She will go again and
complain about me.
I will get scolded.
How do I convince her?
In fact, what is the need
to convince her.
She can stay this way.
I am not scared of her.
But, what happened?
Did someone say something to you?
Did mama scold you?
Why would mama scold me?
She is really good just like Mian Jee,
she really cares for me.
Then brother Hamad scold you?
Uncle Hamad doesn’t even scold
his little children,
how would he scold me?
Then what happened?
Mama agreed to make you stay
at her home with her happiness.
Look Rania,
you didn’t go there to spend time.
You have such a big objective
in front of you.
You have to turn your
dreams into reality.
You have to make Mian Jee
raise his head with pride.
And if you come back,
then you education will remain incomplete.
Look Rania,
if Mian Jee has to bear your hostel
expense along with the college fees,
then he won’t be able to tolerate it.
If there is some small worry,
then tolerate it.
Tolerate it for your better future.
See, what if you have to regret later.
Thank you, aunt.
You gave me the right advice.
I shouldn’t listen to these useless people.
I should put my entire focus on
the objective I came here with.
I will do that.
Well done,
that’s what I am talking about.
Now you put all your focus
on your education.
Okay?
And yes, aunt,
don’t tell Mian Jee and mama,
they will worry for no reason.
Yes, yes, don’t worry. Okay?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
If he called me the relative
of a servant,
then why did I get so angry?
Is my thinking also changing living here?
My Mian Jee says all humans are equal.
Being rich and poor is not the measure
to be called respectable.
Then why am I talking someone’s
useless comment to my heart.
Sorry Mian Jee,
I was forgetting what you taught me.
But now, I will not make this mistake.
Come on, madam prime minister Rania,
you are not going anywhere.
First you will get an admission here,
then you will study with all your heart.
You have to fulfil your Mian Jee’s dream.
Wow. Wow. Wow.
Wow. Just wow.
Nephew.
Hey, nephew, congratulations.
Today I made food.
Hey, poor sister goes to the office,
she comes back tired,
then she goes into the kitchen,
so I thought today I will do her a favour.
By the way,
cooking is not difficult at all.
I have an idea.
Eating such food is difficult.
I have a request from you,
don’t call me on the dinner table.
I cannot praise falsely.
You are insulting uncle’s food openly
Will you leave me alone?
Don’t bother me,
I am already very disturbed.
God be kind,
such an unbelievable situation.
Wont you share your tension
with your four year elder uncle?
Hey, what happened?
Uncle, this old woman
in our neighbourhood.
Yes?
I cannot tell you how stonehearted
and haughty she is.
Oh no. Hey, she can be,
why do we care?
I care. I…oh…
I went to their home
and I guess they didn’t like me at all.
Son, I don’t understand what tone
I should use with you.
Okay, I agree that
you are ordinary.
Such people exist,
learn to manage in this,
don’t learn to be arrogant.
You are being arrogant
and going there you are suffering
from inferiority complex.
Confirm. It is confirmed that you have been
suffering from an inferiority complex.
Hey, it is not about inferiority complex.
You don’t get it.
I mean all this happened
because of my family.
I went there, and I don’t know
about my family background.
What do we do? What not?
What is my family tree?
I cannot tell you, how insulted I felt.
What would you have done?
We had invested in crypto.
Hey, to hell with crypto.
It is the fault of you two,
no one else.
I smell something burning.
I think the dish is burning.
If it gets burned a lot,
I wont leave you.
I am telling you.
What will happen?
What is the matter Saman?
Why the long face?
You always look worried.
Mama, I feel that Babar and
uncle Rafiq wont listen to us.
For them the wealth is more important
than their daughter in law.
Not just property, they wont even
put a few hundred thousand in my name.
Then fine,
Saman too doesn’t have
to go back grandma.
Huh?
My sister is not that worthless for me.
They took me really lightly.
It is time to show them my true colours.
I will see now.
Oh
Mama.
Mama..
Yes, child?
Where did she come from?
Mama. I want to talk to you
about something.
Yes, go ahead child.
What do you want to say.
Now she will surely talk about leaving,
and she will exaggerate and tell mama
the reason for her leaving.
I….
I…I will tell you grandma.
Actually, she wants to go back
to her home
and she will make the excuse
that I didn’t give her my respect,
I mean I didn’t give her respect
and importance.
However, the actual reason
is something else.
She came here because
her parents forced her.
Hey, this studying, and advanced studies
is not her cup of tea.
Now she is giving up and
wants to go back.
So leave, who is stopping you?
What has happened to him?
What is he saying?
I don’t know what stories
he is telling you.
There is nothing like that.
I came to ask you
what I should get cooked today,
and look at him what nonsense
is he speaking.
I feel he has really lost his mind.
Child, he is joking.
He does this, you know.
He takes up after his grandfather.
Yes.
Okay tell me,
what did you want to ask?
I was asking about food.
What do I get cooked?
Hey, get whatever you want cooked.
Just make sure there is rice.
Fine. Once Shehansha comes,
I will inform him.
Yes, yes, okay.
Hey, hey, let me stop.
There are some etiquettes,
some manners. My game…
You stop, don’t give me a lecture.
Listen to me.
On the face of it there is no issue
between Rania and Mahir,
but they are always taunting
each other.
Even as an argument, but
they are engaged with each other.
They keep on taunting each other.
So let it be,
now should I become a referee
and find a middle ground?
You cannot be a referee,
Mr. Hamad,
in that you have to move
your hands and feet.
When will you work so hard?
Listen to me, this fighting
is not a good sign,
it is pointing at something else.
What do you mean?
First firsts,
then small arguments,
then love.
This is what I have seen
in films and dramas.
And if Mahir and Rania fall in love,
then what will happen to my Mona?
Did you fall from the stairs
in childhood?
No. Why?
Because a person loses their mind
falling from the stairs.
I too have seen it in films.
Give back my phone.
Make your own tea,
and also make it for me.
Sister, I have added the coriander, now?
Now mix it well.
Yes, sister, I have mixed it now.
Now leave it alone. Go, get the rice.
Mama has said that we will also have
rice for dinner. Come on, go.
Okay, I will bring it.
You were really giving messages
on the phone,
that I will not stay here any longer,
I am coming back.
Why didn’t you leave?
Why do you care?
I know well.
You will leave all these luxuries and
comfort and go to that village of yours?
It is not possible.
All these are your attention
seeking tactics.
I know it all.
Really wrong thinking.
The real thing is that
my determination is stronger
than the mountains,
and I didn’t see these dreams that
I open my eyes and they break.
I have to fulfil my dreams.
And the most important thing for
this is that I make myself strong,
and ignore everything any
useless person says. Understand?
What happened, Rania?
What happened?
What happened?
Show me?
Where did you burn yourself?
Hey, where? This hand.
Where did it get burned?
Man, this looks bad.
My hand.
You?
hey, you close your mouth.
Go and get some medication.
Her hand caught fire.
There is no fire, I will bring it.
It got burned a little.
Show me. Show me.
Lets pour water. Lets pour water.
It hurts a lot.
Lets pour water and see if it hurts.
There is no water.
Where did your injury go?
Where is the injury? Where is it?
Here you go.
Why are you giving it to me?
Apply it on her hand.
I felt the way the condition is,
you would want to apply it yourself.
Hey, why would I apply it?
I am no compounder.
Hey, show me your hand.
Where does it hurt?
I don’t see the injury.
Are you blind?
Hey, nothing happened.
You are just acting up.
Hey, why would I act up?
The blind man cannot see my injury.
You must have been so lost
in talking that you didn’t see.
Yes, maybe.
Where is it? There is no mark.
The whole hand.
Your whole family has brought you up
with a lot of love,
or else you get these small wounds.
It is not small, had you gotten it,
you would have known.
Oh Mian Jee.
Your tea.
Hey, man, man, man,
what are you doing? Were you
about to commit suicide?
Are you mad?
I will commit suicide jumping
in the swimming pool?
Is this a lake?
Here you go son.
What is this?
Son, these are the papers
of the home.
Why are you giving this to me?
I have put this home
in Saman’s name.
Now you show these papers to sister,
and bring back Saman.
Not at all. I will never do that.
I will never agree to
this condition of their’s.
Papa, relations are formed on
the basis of love and affection.
Relations formed on the basis
of greed are not relations.
And if Saman doesn’t care about
our love and affection,
then she can stay at her parents’ home.
Son, don’t be stubborn.
Sort the matter that can be sorted.
You are seeing after she left this home
is no longer a home.
Neither the three of us are the same.
We go around hiding out faces from
each other, tired, silent, lie in a corner.
Especially you.
Seeing you I am reminded of a lazy
venomous snake lying in the cold weather.
He doesn’t even want to sting anyone.
When she comes you will come back
to life as well.
You know, papa, couldn’t you have given
the example of a sad nightingale?
Son, the nightingale wouldn’t have liked it.
Hah,
papa, the real thing is left in the middle
Nothing is left in the middle.
This is the test of her love.
If she truly loves me,
then she will come back to this home without
getting any of her conditions approved.
After all, the snake has some respect.
Papa, I think brother didn’t like
what you said.
No son, he is being stubborn.
If we look at it, it is not that wrong.
But if two people come
at a dead lock,
then one of them has to bend
or else it doesn’t take relations
to get over.
This means,
I will have to do something.
Not this, bring the other homeo tube,
it is really good for burns.
Homeo?
I will go and check inside.
No, not at all.
These tubes from the city
wont work. Mama!
I feel I got the evil eye,
it is burning a lot.
Stop this drama.
You act like you are really
delicate for no reason.
Nothing happened to you.
Grandma, even I got worried at first,
then I checked myself.
Hey she didn’t even get a scratch.
What are you saying?
Is this even something
you should say?
My daughter doesn’t create
a scene for no reason.
I think that some injuries cannot
be seen on the outside.
We will have to take her
to the doctor.
You do one thing, take out
the car and take her.
What?
Hey, grandma, there is no need
to take her to the doctor.
She got such a small injury.
Yes, so even my daughter
is like a flower.
Look, you take her to the doctor
and then after you get the medication
prescribed, go feed her something.
The Dahi Balay of Lahore,
and then the butter milk along with it.
After you feed her, do take her
out somewhere too.
Since she has come,
the poor thing has been locked up in
the home. You take her for an outing.
Butter milk?
Yes.
Dahi ballay?
Yes.
Grandma, before all this, the doctor
will admit me in the mental hospital.
I will be insulted.
Ouch,
the burning has spread
in the entire arm, mama.
It hurts a lot. Oh,
I am dead. Oh.
We don’t even have the tube.
Oh, then we will have to go. Come on,
take out the car, take her along.
Yes, come on, come.
What if you die cause of the pain?
Yes. Come on. Come on.
See. Did you see grandma. Did you see?
She is fine, she is acting.
Oh…
Hey, she is acting.
I feel dizzy.
Come on.
Should I get a wheel chair for you?
Where is he taking the girl
holding her like that?
Rania burned her hand so much,
brother Mahir took her
to the doctor.
So much? How much?
It was a minor injury.
We even applied your tube,
then why is he taking her to the doctor?
I have sent her, now speak!
Why is aunt so angry?
She is jealous.
Yes, I will go get the tube
from her.
Doctor.
Yes, I will talk to you.
How are you Mahir?
I am fine, doctor.
I am good.
This is my cousin, Rania,
she burned her hand, check it.
Show me the hand that got burned.
This is the hand. It hurts a lot, doctor.
Hey she has the lifestyle of a princess,
doctor.
The family really cares for her,
they never made her do any work.
You see, try searching with
a magnifying glass.
Who knows, you might find a
small wound somewhere. See.
You know, who has so many
people to care for her,
she will throw tantrums.
Experience, doctor.
A lot of experience.
You know, I can count
the wings of a bird.
Fine, if you have checked her,
then can we go now?
Hey,
he has more pain on his face,
than her.
What do you say, doctor?
Absolutely.
Come on. Thank you.
Thank you doctor.
Hey wait,
She has no special
or ordinary wound.
I think she got scared.
Make her have juice,
feed her curry,
so that she can become
a little healthy.
Take her out so that
she gets fresh.
Thank you doctor,
you are really good.
Thank you.
Fine, thank you.
Here you go.
Thank you. Come on.
Yes, come on.
Get up.
We have to eat a lot as well.
Absolutely.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Seeing them reminds me
of my college days,
the whole college used to be
after me like this.
Me too.
This place is so lively.
I think there is custom of sitting
at home in this city.
It feels like the whole city
is on the road.
Fine. Fine.
We have come to have juice.
Quickly drink juice
so that you come to your senses,
and come on.
No. No. I just won’t have juice.
Did you not hear
what the doctor said?
I have a bad injury,
you should keep me happy.
You know, my mind especially comes
into place by eating gol gappay.
Where did you get me caught?
What is there to be caught in this?
I didn’t ask you to get something
from the moon.
We have come to the restaurant,
you need to order, pay the money,
you don’t have to make
anything yourself.
Okay fine. Fine.
Order. Come on, now.
Shall we go upstairs?
What is wrong?
Why don’t you sit comfortably?
Where are they?
I had told you aunt,
they went to the doctor.
You go to the doctor for a reason.
This is a chill program.
Listen to her,
does anyone go
to the doctor to chill?
I had told you,
I had sent them.
It has been so long...
Aren’t they late?
Even if they are late,
why do you have a problem?
Go sit with your useless husband.
You are taunting me like I got the useless,
stupid and lazy husband here from my home.
Hey…
Hey grandma, so much anger.
So much tension?
You know, because of anger and tension,
you get wrinkles on your face.
I have no tension, no anger.
I was bored,
I thought that when we all gather
we will have fun.
Now you have had fun, now, come on, go.
Go, get your children to do their homework.
Okay mama.
She is a weird woman.
She is worried about
Mahir and Rania.
She is getting slim in its sorrow.
Nothing else.
I already had few peanuts,
and now half of them are burnt.
it is really delicious.
I wish Babo and mama were here.
Bebo and mama really
like gol gappay.
Oh we should have got
Rabail along with us.
Had she come, she would have
had so much fun, right?
It is really delicious.
You too eat.
Don’t look at me like this,
what if I get a stomach home
after getting home.
Hey, hello. Hello. Hello.
I asked you to eat,
I didn’t ask you to eat
from my plate.
Order for yourself
if you want to eat it,
I don’t share food.
When was I eating it.
After all, I don’t eat this nonsense.
And eat with some manners, decently.
Everyone is looking at our table.
If someone I know sees me,
then what will they think about me,
that what ill-mannered person
am I sitting with and eating.
Really?
So what is the big deal in that?
Say that she is the cousin of your servant.
Servant’s cousin?
And I am sitting here with my servant’s
cousin and eating food?
I have made my respect
with a lot of difficulty.
For God’s sake, please, for…
There is no point.
There is no point trying
to make you understand.
Spicy.
It is really spicy. One second,
give this to me.
If it is really spicy, then should I order
two to three tanks of water, drink them.
Just order one more of this.
Waiter.
Have breakfast properly,
what armies are after you?
Hey, grandma it is just fine.
I have to go to the university,
I am getting late.
I will have it later.
Okay, I am done.
Clean your plate and go.
okay, bye.
Bye. Bye brother Mahir.
Bye. Goodbye.
What is wrong?
have breakfast or you will get
slapped before going to school.
Mama, even brother Mahir went
without having breakfast,
no one said anything to him.
Because no one stopped him as a child.
If he was slapped as a child,
I would have seen how he would have
gone without eating his breakfast.
You said the right thing, aunt.
I always say the right thing,
if someone agrees then.
Anyway, leave me, tell me,
did you enjoy with Mahir?
What did you do? What did you eat?
Where did you go?
Hey, we ate a lot.
We had dahi ballay,
we even had butter milk, it is delicious,
you people should have it too.
We also had gol gappay.
Rabail, you should have come along,
I really missed you.
it would have been a lot of fun.
My son is so caring,
he doesn’t let anyone get bored.
Who are you talking about?
Mahir, who else?
He is so easy going.
Really? I don’t know,
maybe he laughs seeing himself
in the mirror.
He is always annoyed usually.
Come on, finish the breakfast,
why are you people taking so long?
Don’t the children have to go to school?
Yes, this.
Cheating.
I am not cheating.
This is confirmed cheating.
No. I am not cheating at all.
Here you go.
Ayaz, if you get free from this important work,
then listen to me too.
Sister, I am listening.
I am listening.
I have a colleague, Nazia.
What? Has she become a widow?
Or did her husband divorce her?,
Hey damn you, listen to me completely.
Go ahead.
Hey, she has an elder sister,
she didn’t get along with her husband,
they got separated three years back.
Okay, I am thinking
I will send your proposal.
Why ask before doing something good.
Sister, go ahead.
Okay, but what do I say?
That my brother considers these
ordinary jobs as per his standard
and he plans to do big businesses.
He doesn’t have a penny in his pocket,
so all the plans are left incomplete.
What good news did I want to give you?
I wanted to tell you that
I am thinking of finding a job.
Yes.
Oh thank God, you thought
of something good.
So sister, I am applying
for the jobs today.
I have some multinationals
in my mind by the way.
You talk about that marriage.
Just pray that those people agree,
they don’t say no looking at you.
What do I lack?
You lack sense.
Okay.
Mama,
by the way what are you doing
in the evening?
Pay the neighbours a visit.
Why is that?
Hey, you got angry.
I was just saying it.
Even neighbours have rights,
you should meet them.
I don’t have spare time like you people,
understand?
Shehanshah.
Shehanshah.
Mama has been calling you for so long.
You are sitting here. Go.
First listen to me.
Do what I am saying.
Take this shirt, and go iron it.
Quickly. Quickly.
Give me the shirt, I will do it.
You go. Go. Go. Go.
What are you doing?
I asked you to do something and you…
Return my shirt.
You know how expensive it is?
You don’t have manners
to do anything right.
If my shirt gets burned,
it will be a big loss. Return it.
You know,
I iron clothes well,
it is up to you. If you don’t want it,
then do it yourself.
I do it myself?
There are so many servants
in the home,
what do I pay them for?
Me? Hello.
Who are you showing off
in front of?
Listen to me,
it's easy to be arrogant
on your father’s earning.
It is only good if a person
does things himself.
After all,
I have heard, that an arrogant mother
also lives with papa abroad.
If mama tells papa not
to send you money one day,
then what will happen to you?
In defence…
I know. I know.
you have a lot of property,
but that too belongs
to your papa. Right?
What do you own?
For no reason.
Hey, someone also teach us
to show off for no reason.
I don’t know how people
show off like this.
You know, this is a talent
I will have to learn it.
To show off a person
should have a quality.
If you show off,
people will consider you mad.
Really?
What quality do you have?
Quality?
I have qualities.
Go ask the girls in my university.
Girls die for me.
They must not be girls,
they must be goats.
It is useless to talk to you.
He looks okay,
he is good at heart too,
girls might die after him.
His pride stops me from
speaking the truth.
Come on, come quickly.
Sister, let me play a little longer.
Your mama is really angry,
even if two minutes… Hello.
Hi.
I was waiting for you.
Why?
Do you need anything else now?
It is not necessary that a person will
only come for tea leaf and salt.
I came to ask when
you are coming to our home?
No, no, we have everything
present at our home,
so we don’t need to go to anyone’s home,
to ask for anything.
You are insulting me badly.
I was asking when you would
come to our home,
to meet my mama,
to meet my sister,
speak up.
When will you come?
Wow,
you suddenly became
so informal from being formal.
Why?
Didn’t you like it?
Tell me honestly.
Come on.
Greet mama from me.
Are you mad?
if I greet mama then she will ask me
a hundred questions.
Who is it? Where did you meet him?
What did you talk about?
How will I answer for
so many questions?
Oh,
so this means,
I will have to come to your home
to greet her.
Yes, maybe.
Okay fine,
we will meet again this way.
What did you think of suddenly?
Hey, grandma, whether I remember it
while sitting or standing,
it is right, right?
You think yourself,
there his second wife
is having a good time.
And here, papa just sends us
a few dollars
and gets rid of all his responsibilities.
Grandma, that’s it,
it is enough.
Now it won’t happen.
You talk to papa
and ask him to increase
the amount of dollars
and put this property in my name.
Hey son,
you are your father’s only son,
it all belongs to you.
Hey, is belongs to her
for no reason?
And that poor other mother,
does she not have a right?
No, this will be a big mistreatment,
mama.
He is my father, our property,
who are you to interfere?
Who am I? I am bearer of justice.
And I will not let that innocent girl
get mistreated, mama.
Such greedy sons, God forbid,
you don’t give wealth to such sons,
you disown them.
And be afraid of the time, when I put
all the of you in a corner.
Grandma, I am talking to you about
something so important and she…
That thing is over,
I have told you,
I will not that oppressed
woman gets mistreated.
She has a full right on the wealth.
Grandma, make her shut up.
I am telling you,
make her shut up.
Go from here,
don’t drive me mad. Go.
Okay, here you go, then.
Grandma, we will talk about
our home privately.
I don’t know what has happened
to him suddenly, huh?
He has me worried.
I don’t know who put
all this in his head.
Here you go.
What happened?
What are you thinking?
Did you not talk to brother Arbab?
Rabail, Arbab didn’t even call me.
Oh, why? Maybe he is upset.
He is surely upset.
I just asked a small share
in the property,
he is not talking to me.
He got so upset.
So you give up this wish.
I will not give up this wish
even when I die.
I know his reality.
He only loves his wealth.
I have no importance in his eyes.
Hey, if you know his reality,
everything is clear in front of you,
then why are you getting tired
thinking about everything?
To hell with it.
Do I want to stay sad?
To miss him?
But when I remember that
he only loves his wealth,
he doesn’t care about me at all.
My heart hurts.
I get really sad,
I don’t like it at all.
Don’t be sad,
come here.
Keep my cup too.
Come here. Come here.
Come here to me.
My lovely sister.
Write well, such bad handwriting,
you will get beaten. Come on,
write it this small. Understand?
Wow, you are studying hard.
Good.
Come on,
go write it there.
You people have to come first,
hear me out.
By the way, Rania,
I was thinking,
you are always mentioning Mian Jee,
but you never talk about
your father. Why?
I was really young,
when papa passed away.
How young?
I don’t know,
I wasn’t even in my senses,
so I don’t remember anything.
Okay,
so did you not ask Mian Jee
about your papa.
I have. I have asked him
many times.
But, this mention makes him sad,
so he doesn’t talk much.
All of you are here, huh?
Come, mama. Come. Have a seat,
see the weather is so good.
Yes, that is why I came to the lawn too.
You did good.
Yes.
Mama, aunt was asking how young
was I when papa passed away.
You must remember,
how old was I?
Child, what has passed,
has passed.
now you are Mian Jee’s daughter,
and my brother has worked
really hard on you.
He left nothing unattended.
Now you too have to make him proud.
Without a doubt. Without a doubt.
By the way,
what did Rania’s father do?
He was an educated,
young man.
He lived and earned well.
Really? No one ever told me this.
What had papa studied?
Hey child, what old things are
you people talking about.
I came to say that also care
about Saman,
she keeps sitting alone,
she gets disappointed,
talk to her, have fun with her,
divert her attention.
Mama, how do we divert her attention,
we have our own issues.
If you listen to me, send her.
Give up on your conditions.
If it takes long, we will be at loss.
You mean that I being really rich,
give up in front of that upstart?
I take back my conditions and
send Saman back to her in-laws?
Mama, this was my small opinion.
You have to do
what you think is right.
I will tell you this, that,
that upstart is much richer than us.
Listen to me,
us rich people are not impressed
by these things.
To hell with it. Bloody miser.
I found out about this today,
that my papa was a really educated man.
I am surprised, no one ever told me this.
I am the daughter of such a capable man.
I should know everything about my papa.
When I go home this time, I will ask
Mian Jee about everything.
I will ask him everything.
How was he?
What did he think about me?
He must love me a lot.
I wish.
I wish he was alive today.
