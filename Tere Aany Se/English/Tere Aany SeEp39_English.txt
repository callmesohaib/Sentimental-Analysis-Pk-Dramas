Mian Jee, I agree it is my fault.
Whatever happened, it is all my fault.
That is why I am begging you
for forgiveness today.
Mian Jee,
all of us came to apologize
on his behalf.
But brother Zaman has
fixed Rania’s decision.
Hey, to hell with it.
I mean, to hell with that proposal,
Mian Jee.
Look at our boy, see his face.
He is sitting embarrassed.
Hey, turn your face. See.
Mian Jee,
who doesn’t make mistake,
brother Zaman made a mistake,
everyone forgave him.
Forgive this poor thing too,
Mian Jee.
Mian Jee, don’t sit quietly like that.
Say something.
Forgive me.
I will also apologize to Rania.
Yes, Mian Jee, and brother will
even say no to the proposal
that has been fixed with Honey.
Hey, Honey…Honey was just a drama,
Mian Jee.
You know it.
It is a no from me for her.
Hey, I know it was a drama,
there is no such emergency.
Mian Jee, I don’t have this
big grand home,
a lot of money,
and big business like uncle Zaman.
But I promise you, Mian Jee,
I will work really hard,
I will do something on my own,
I will be successful.
Please listen to me,
don’t take Rania away from me.
I will accept,
but who will make Zaman understand?
Hey, my legs hurt bad, here.
Massage it. Yes. Yes.
Hey Mian Jee, if you say something to him,
how will he say no?
He cannot reject what you say.
Understanding you is the most
difficult thing in the world.
Yes, so who told you
to research on me?
Rania,
don’t you care about the feelings
of anyone else?
You do, right?
so you go and tell him to consider you
his daughter from today.
God forbid.
He is talking about his feelings,
I am talking about my feeling.
Your?
Feelings?
You are amongst those people
who only live for themselves.
Your ego gets hurts
on every small thing,
and if you raise your voice
it is for your own right.
if you do anything then it is for yourself,
for your benefit.
I don’t want to waste my time
on a man like you.
Do you understand?
Rania,
do you really think about me like this?
Yes, that’s how I think about you and
this opinion will not change.
Hi Rabail.
Oh wow, you recognized me.
I thought, just like brother
you have forgotten all of us too.
I had no such relation with your brother,
but yes, you are my friend
I have a deep relation with you.
You are lying to yourself again.
Stop it, Rania.
All of us can see the relation
you have with brother.
But you two?
You two have been stupid on your own
and are on a mission to ruin this relation.
You know,
brother fixed this false relation
to make you feel jealous,
and your father?
He came to play the role of the villain
in the film.
Come on, Rania, this is not fair.
You know, I have never seen brother
as worried as he is today.
If you two behave like this,
then brother will really
get engaged to Honey.
Although, I have confirmed
that he loves you,
Rania and he is doing
all this to get you.
He is not even caring
about his ego.
And he is apologizing
to everyone and you?
You are not even able
to forgive him.
You have become so selfish?
Rania, you always solve
everyone’s issues,
today I am asking you for my brother.
Solve my brother’s problem, please.
Mahir.
Bebo, when did you come?
Who else came with you?
No one else came right now.
I used the parlour as an excuse
to meet you.
And to ask you what you two
are doing with each other?
You tell me, what do I do?
hey, I have gotten tired asking for
forgiveness but Rania isn’t forgiving me.
She feels I am the biggest cheat
and liar of the world.
You tell me, what do I do?
Mahir, things have gotten out
of Rania’s hands.
But no matter what
you have to make her yours.
You are a boy,
you should be this strong.
You do one thing,
talk to brother Zaman.
As soon as Dr. Wasiq’s chapter is closed,
we will convince Rania ourselves.
Hey, yes. You are right.
Thank you Bebo.
I really like it that you are with me.
Hey, why not?
Only you two look good as a pair.
Mahir,
Where are you going, son?
I am going to do something important dad,
pray that I become successful in it.
What are you saying? son?
Hey, I won’t pray for you?
You are my only son. Only.
I love you more than myself,
but son, I feel that whatever
is happening with you,
I too am responsible for it somewhere.
Go.
I really love you, dad.
But it is the problem of this love,
you only find out when
you have hurt your beloved.
Go son,
I too really love you a lot.
in fact, all off are with you.
Go win your world.
Mahir, where are you going?
Hey, you never call someone
from behind.
And where he is heading he will never tell you
where he is going, do you understand?
Dabeer, aren’t you being
a little too sentimental?
I wanted that he takes the car,
after all he is my future son in law.
There is no need for that,
I am fine on my bike. Bye dad.
Goodbye son.
Go son, in God’s protection.
Shall we go inside?
What are you doing standing here?
Come. He has left.
Uncle, whatever was the truth,
I have told you.
It was just a small mischief, that’s it.
I admit it was my mistake,
that mistake became a punishment
for me as well.
But I had no such intention.
That’s what happens, son.
At times the small mistakes
of life give us big lessons.
Uncle you see, see here,
I beg you and apologize,
please forgive me.
Give Rania’s hand in my hand.
I know only you have all the right.
Please uncle.
Why do you want to embarrass me?
You are apologizing and that too
to a sinner like me?
See, you are a really good boy,
my own blood
but Rania is my daughter,
for whom I couldn’t do
anything all my life,
and now when there is a chance,
I want to do everything for her.
That is why I chose Dr. Wasiq,
because he will keep Rania happy.
Uncle, what do you think?
Wont I be able to keep Rania happy?
You are just like Rania,
neither she trusts me, nor do you.
I trust you son.
I trust you completely.
But I don’t trust your
step mother at all.
She has enmity with
my daughter for no reason.
Hey uncle,
she has nothing to do with me.
Aunty Sweetie cannot interfere
in my life.
She has already interfered in your life.
And sorry to say, but I cannot send
my daughter to such a home,
where there will be
a new problem daily.
Dr. Wasiq is someone we know,
he has no one but us.
We are his family and he is our family,
that is why he will be better.
Uncle, you please think about
what I said with a cool mind…
I liked seeing your courage.
At least, you said this looking in my eyes.
I know you will go really far in life.
How will I go far uncle?
You are snatching my life from me.
I am making my daughter’s life.
Goodbye.
You know, Rania,
I don’t like seeing you sad like this.
I want to say no to the wedding as well.
Don’t you dare.
Don’t even think about it.
Poor uncle will drink poison and die.
Why poison?
Because sleeping pills are
really expensive.
Uncle will think when I have to die,
then I will die cheap.
It is so wrong, you are so bad.
Yes, maybe.
Is Mahir calling?
Yes.
then talk to him.
When you have decided
to go your separate ways,
then say goodbye to him nicely.
Then he will start his life with Honey,
and you accept Dr. Wasiq.
Maybe this is the end of this story.
Pick up the phone.
Your dad is even more stubborn
than you, Rania.
I tried pleading, begging,
requesting him,
but he is not ready to listen to me.
He doesn’t see anyone
beyond Dr. Wasiq.
If papa has told you his decision,
why did you call me?
Look Rania nothing is ruined till now.
All my family is standing with me.
even Mian Jee and Bebo are with us.
Once we get married,
everything will be fine,
no one will say anything.
Do you understand?
What do you want to say?
I go against my father’s decision
and marry you?
It is true that I don’t want
to marry Dr. Wasiq,
it is also true that I like you,
still…
still I cannot sadden my father.
This is a question of our life.
Life is something
you cannot trust Mahir,
and I will not break my father’s trust
for something that cannot be trusted.
no matter the whole family
is standing with us.
Don’t be emotional
and decide, Rania.
Think with a cool mind.
I have always been emotional
and emotional people have a
soft heart too.
I have seen Mian Jee suffer
because of my papa’s disobedience,
I don’t want that my papa stays restless
because of me all his life.
You…
you get in the relation with Honey.
No matter how Aunty Sweetie is,
Honey is not like her.
She is a really good girl.
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
Nephew, thank God you landed.
Come quickly to the event,
come quickly…what?
The plane is not flying?
The flight got canceled?
It is raining in Karachi?
What are you saying?
you are not coming to the event?
Oh my,
what excuse will I make?
Here, talk to Rabail.
Rabail, talk to him.
I don’t want to talk to him.
Talk to him.
No.
She doesn’t want to talk to you.
Greetings sister.
Greetings Mian Jee.
Greetings. Greeting. Listen,
did you hurt your neck, huh?
It look stiff.
Oh sister,
I am really tired of this habit
of joking of yours.
After all, I am father of the groom.
I need to show this much attitude.
Hah, okay then
you keep your attitude,
we are seeing the dance.
I am also seeing it and doing it.
What happened?
Did you get scared?
I am not even scared of my father.
Music.
Stop the drum. Stop it.
Where is the DJ? DJ,
give me a mic. Give me a mic.
Yes. Yes. Is it on?
Hello. Hello.
Greetings.
And I want to say that today,
me and my brother Anwaar Ahmed
Siddique have decided
that today on this happy occasion,
we will make the function even better.
Listen. Listen.
I want to have my lovely grandson
Mahir’s engagement today,
our lovely granddaughter,
my stupid Rania.
This is cheating.
Mahir’s proposal has been fixed
with my Honey.
Where did this Rania come from?
Hey, be quiet.
Give me this.
Here. Here.
Be quiet,
all of you listen to me.
These children consider me
their elder and sympathizer,
and I too am really their
true sympathizer,
so sister and I have decided
for their wedding.
Okay?
And now everyone has to create
an issue in this decision.
What do you understand?
Yes.
Rania, child,
Mahir truly loves you.
Understand.
In the past whatever he did
knowingly and unknowingly,
he is embarrassed on it himself,
so leave the past behind
and step in the future.
Yes, that’s the deal.
Yes, the decision that
you have made for Mahir,
he will regret it all his life.
I will put this home,
this wealth in my name
and these useless freeloaders
living in my home
I will drag them out. Mr. Zaman,
you too think about it,
will you give your daughter
to this poor man?
With all due respect, rich people like
you are the poor people,
who don’t know the importance of love.
It took me a long time to
understand it as well.
Aunty Sweetie,
before you make the wish
to snatch this home, see this.
What is this?
This is the accounts for the salary you
didn’t pay uncle Dabeer in the past 20 years.
He used to care for your shop
like an employee
and you never paid him a salary,
and you kept on saying who takes
a salary to care for his own shop?
But now I feel that the time is here
and it is necessary.
First we will clear the accounts
for the past twenty years
and then we will talk about
anything else.
Honey, how can you go against me
like this?
I feel embarrassed calling you
my life partner.
If you want to go to America,
then go.
I will stay here in Pakistan
with my Honey.
Listen, Sweetie,
you go, leave us alone.
Come we will complete the ceremony.
Come on. Come on child. Come.
Hello. Hello.
Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad Jumman
speaking.
Hey, give it to me.
Mian Jee…
Mahir, son, my prince,
your grandfather gave me this ring,
now you put this on your wife’s finger,
my son.
Live long, you too live long.
My love.
Come on, put the ring on her finger.
One second. One second.
What happened?
I want you to promise me something.
Promise?
Fine, I will fulfill all promises, okay?
No, I want you to promise.
What promise?
Promise me that you will not stop me
to from becoming the prime minister.
What? Prime Minister?
I accept. I accept. Mahir,
say that you accept it.
Accept it. Yes. Yes.
Say it son, say it.
Accept it.
Okay fine. Fine. I accept.
Wasiq, son,
for the sake of my happiness,
she was sacrificing her happiness, so…
Papa,.
You made the right decision.
If the relations of a life time,
are made with the heart instead
of the mind, then they last forever.
I am happy.
This is what I expected from you.
Congratulations from me as well.
Dabeer, why is everyone staring
at me like this?
Everyone is surprised on how
you changed your style suddenly.
You know I like joking.
Was this you joking?
In future will you remain
in your senses?
Mama, she was joking, fine,
accept what she said.
She was joking.
Hey, not this music, that one.
Let me have some romantic moment.
By the way…
I feel…
You did something big making
two lovers meet.
You don’t get disheartened,
those two were made for each other.
