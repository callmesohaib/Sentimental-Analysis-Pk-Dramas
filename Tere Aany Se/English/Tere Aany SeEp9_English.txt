Keep on standing.
What would they think about me?
Huh?
This old woman exaggerates a lot,
and along with that she shows-off.
She speaking all this nonsense
to impress us.
Keep on standing.
Because of you I got insulted
so badly.
Sorry mama,
but I feel that
I have no fault in all this.
Huh?
Can you not see straight?
The guests were sitting
having breakfast.
Couldn’t you have shut up?
Mama.
You are getting emotional
for no reason.
I think those people were
so busy eating
that they didn’t even hear uncle talk.
You are embarrassed for no reason,
it is fine, let it go.
Yes, yes, mama.
When those people eating
all their focus was on the food,
they didn’t hear anything we said.
Yes, mama,
I think the same thing.
Okay fine,
keep on standing.
Are you people speaking the truth?
Huh?
Yes, mama.
Okay then, sit down.
Hey, no mama,
I remembered,
when he came and
said if today is Eid,
both of them laughed a lot.
What? Stand up!
Hey, was it the Olympics of exaggeration?
The old lady was showing off,
we set this table at our home daily.
Hey, if we had stayed a little longer,
then she would have declared herself
as the family of Mughal-e-Azam.
God bless that lost man who came
and revealed her exaggeration
or else she was not stopping.
Uncle it is really bad,
you don’t say these things
about your well-wishers.
They have done us so many favours,
do you see that?
They took Laiba to the hospital,
taking care of her
and inviting us for breakfast today.
It is really bad.
Hey, we were sitting
on the breakfast table,
like we had gone to get a proposal.
By the way, nephew,
they seemed like a decent family,
they have liveliness.
So find out, apart from that table,
I think all of them booked,
if there is someone else
who I can look at and things get set.
Something happens.
What are you saying, uncle?
Hey, I don’t know who lives there,
and what not?
I went there for the first time myself.
I don’t know.
Son, find out.
If with you I too settle down,
then what is wrong in that? Huh?
Okay fine, I will find out.
Okay?
How did you like that girl…
She was not a girl, she was the wife
of that man who had come.
Hey, no, no, not her.
The girl we met outside.
The shy one, the pretty one.
Rania!
She is a good girl.
I will thank her,
since she has done a lot.
I am not talking about Rania,
I am talking about the other girl
on whose head you refused to
put your hand on. That one. That one.
The one that was quiet?
Yes.
The one who was sitting mute?
Hey, I don’t like such people.
Yes, talk about Rania,
she has potential. Work on her.
Hey, no Rabail is smarter,
sober and pretty.
Smart, sober, pretty,
how do you know?
Did you do an Istikhara sitting there?
Because I know better than you.
Huh?
Yes,
I know people, and don’t you dare
praise Rania in front of mama.
I am telling you.
It is so surprising,
you are putting such a weird
restriction on me
It is time for my university,
I am getting late.
You go to Laiba at the hospital.
I am going.
Hey, have I started a pick and
drop service in this home?
I am getting late.
Hey, you are getting late,
what am I doing in this home?
I will see. One minute,
where is my phone?
It is upstairs. I will see.
I am going to the hospital.
I will come soon. Don’t worry.
You are going to the hospital again?
Mama, Laiba is still in the hospital.
Now being their neighbours
we have this responsibility
that we ask them how they are.
How will we go?
Listen, Saman, call Hammad.
Say that it is something important.
Leave it.
By the time he wakes up,
it will be lunch time
instead of breakfast.
I am not a child,
I will go myself.
And then I will go on uncle’s bike,
I have a license too.
Okay, wear a helmet.
Okay, goodbye.
Go, safe.
Why do you have a long face?
Huh?
It feels like I have made you stay here
through a conspiracy and not for your benefit.
mama, I was thinking
I will go back home.
Listen, don’t get slapped by me.
Now it is the matter of my ego,
that’s it.
I am the daughter of rich people,
and what do you think,
I will give up in front of that up-start?
Don’t you dare take another
step without my permission.
Mama.
Be quiet.
Ifrah is calling?
Hello. Yes, Irfah. How are you?
I am fine.
Where are you? first tell me this.
I am going to the university.
You tell me. How is grandma?
Grandma didn’t like it at all that
you came to the hospital
and went without meeting her.
Man, try to understand,
the situation was such.
Okay listen, listen, listen,
I think sir Zeeshan doesn’t have
his class today,
and I think miss Saliya
won’t be here right now.
So, I will do one thing, I will come
to the hospital and meet grandma.
Fine. come quickly, me and
grandma are waiting for you. Okay?
Okay. Okay. I am coming.
I am coming. Bye.
Bye.
Oh Ifrah, what do I tell you?
Your grandma bothers me so much.
I have been trying to feed her food
for so long, she is not eating.
I don’t know what her issue is.
Greetings, how are you people?
Greetings.
We are fine, you tell me,
how are you?
You have come alone?
Where is he?
He? Who he?
Do you see how naïve she is acting,
like she doesn’t know
who I am talking about.
Hey I am talking about your hero,
love.
He hasn’t come.
Where is he?
He is actually in university,
he is just…
Okay should I tell you
something interesting?
That hero looks just like my ideal.
Since childhood, I have been
dreaming of such a prince.
Oh. I remember a couplet.
Go ahead, ask me to recite it.
Recite it. Recite.
This is the complaint I have from life.
This is the complaint I have from life…
it's been a long time since I got it.
Hey, you didn’t have to laugh on this,
you had to appreciate it. Say wow.
Wow. Amazing Wow.
Wow. Wow.
You know Rania,
you got saved at my hands.
Had I met you earlier,
I would have killed you.
Huh? I will go meet Laiba.
Yes.
Yes. Yes. Go. Go. You know
Laiba is much better now.
I forgot, Dr. Wasiq had called me.
I will go.
Oh God, I will come.
God!
Laiba, child,
you still haven’t had breakfast?
Okay, have a little fruit.
Mama, you know I cannot eat
this diet food.
I don’t like it here.
I want to go home.
Greetings!
How are you, now?
You know the staff told me that
by the grace of God you are much better. Huh?
Yes, she is insisting to go home.
Sister Rania, I am getting really bored here,
and then this tasteless food.
Hah, so I have come to remove
your boredom and see,
I got such delicious food
for you people.
Rania, what was the need
for this formality?
The first thing is that
this is not a formality,
being your neighbour
it is my responsibility.
Now quickly, go and wash your hands,
we will eat together.
You are a really good girl.
Okay fine, I will come.
Come on.
Oh God, I knew it.
I knew it.
You would surely come.
You came after her.
Hey, I was just…
See, our Romeo is also here.
What do you mean?
He admitted it?
You two are now set?
Amazing man.
Hey, hello. What setting?
Have you gone mad?
What are you saying?
Hey, you say such good things.
But I was talking about your Romeo.
Hey, Dr. Wasiq had asked me
for this list.
I will just come.
This staff shouldn’t be
in this hospital,
they should be in a mental hospital.
And you?
What were you saying?
I have a setting?
Are you in your senses?
What was I saying?
I was standing quietly.
I feel you are hearing things.
Really?
I am hearing things?
And this staff,
what she said and went,
what did this mean?
Dr. Wasiq gave her a file…
Okay quiet. I am not stupid,
I understand everything
that is happening.
Give me the file for bed 24.
Sister Anjum?
Yes. Yes. Yes, sir?
Is there a monkey show outside?
No sir.
Then what are you trying to peak
at bending your neck?
Actually sir, some shows are even
more interesting than a monkey show.
And such a show is taking place outside.
Huh?
But when will you understand these things,
it is a matter of the heart.
Your profession is a respectable
profession.
And leave this nonseriousness.
Understand your profession.
Give me the file.
What I am thinking sir has nothing
to do with my profession,
it is linked to the heart.
And everyone has a heart, sir.
Huh!
I am adding this medicine
in the file of bed 24.
Please check it.
It is time for the round
of the private room,
and please get serious.
Oh God,
hey, is it a crime for people from a
respectable profession to smile and laugh?
What would doctor Wasiq know
how relaxed patients feel
with our frankness.
Half their ailment is removed
with our good behaviour.
But who will explain this
to this damned Dr. Wasiq.
Brother, pack three cups of tea quickly.
This is really bad,
I cannot eat it.
Ifrah, you?
Had I known, I would have brought food
for you along with aunt Anila.
Man, actually, mom and
dad are out of country.
They will come in a few days,
so I will manage.
What do you mean?
You are handling all this alone?
Why did you not tell me earlier?
Okay, from today, we will take care
of grandma together.
I will spend some time with her,
and you spend some time with her.
Okay?
Rania, you are so good.
I have never seen a girl
like you till today.
Shall I make you meet aunt?
Yes, let me just give tea to aunt Anila,
then we will meet.
Quickly.
Is the tea ready?
How much money?
Hey child,
we are tired of lying here.
Tell them to discharge me
and leave me alone.
Hey aunty,
the doctors will discharge you
when they feel reasonable.
You rest. Now tell me,
how are you…
Greetings, grandma.
How are you?
Yes, I am fine, greetings.
Grandma, this is Rania.
Hey, Rania. This is that girl
who got that child,
that stranger’s child to the hospital.
Right?
Yes. Yes.
Hey, you give me a hug.
She is that girl.
Wow. Wow.
Well done, child. Well done.
You did something good.
Yes, grandma.
She has a beautiful heart.
From today,
she is my best friend.
Okay, your best friend is really good.
Grandma,
Rania talks well as well.
Now you won’t get bored.
Yes, I am really bored,
talk about good things.
Ifrah, what is wrong with you?
You were fine till yesterday,
what happened today?
Say it. No, no, say it,
she is under my influence.
Mahir, Rania is a really good girl,
she has also said that
she will solve Salik’s matter.
What?
Are you mad?
She said it and you believed it?
She can only ruin matters,
not solve them.
Hey, she does such weird things,
what is wrong with you?
Are you challenging me?
Me? and I will challenge you?
Are you in your senses?
You came to fulfil your responsibility
towards the neighbours,
so go to their room.
What are you doing here?
You be quiet. Ifrah,
you call Salik.
Tell Salik to bring all the elders,
I mean the heads of their family here
and tell them that his friend’s
grandmother is really unwell.
Okay?
I will handle the rest.
Oh wow, what a great plan.
Too good.
You know what she will do now?
She will kidnap the elder of their family
and as ransom,
she will ask for your proposal
for Salik, right?
Stupid plan.
Always think negative.
Hey, when Salik’s family will come,
they will meet our great grandmother
that is when their thinking will change.
And then grandma too
will meet them.
She will meet them,
they will see her,
understand them, then only will
she be able to decide. Right grandma?
Yes, the girl has weight
in what she is saying.
Then what are you waiting for?
You call Salik.
Okay.
that’s it.
I have had enough of your dramas.
This will do nothing.
I am going home.
Do you want to come home
with me or not?
Hey, how can I go home?
I have a lot of work.
Hey two people
I know are hospitalized.
I am really busy, you go.
Busy?
To hell with your busyness.
Fine, then stay here,
I am going home.
Grandma, I will leave.
Okay child, goodbye.
Bye.
Do visit at night.
We have to show you the achievement
of my smartness as well.
Lets see.
Tell me more.
What more do I tell you?
You tell me.
Hello. Salik.
Salik, I had to tell you…
It was really bitter.
Brother, I want to go home.
Please you talk to the doctor.
I will. It will be done.
Hey Farhad,
you have come at the right time.
I really needed you.
Irfah, take out the money.
I will give you money,
go quickly and get sweets.
Huh? Sweets? What is the sweet for?
There is no labor ward here.
it is possible that we need sweets.
Her in-laws are coming.
Oh, I didn’t introduce her.
This is Irfah.
Hello. Hello.
I am Rania’s friend.
Hello.
Aunty,
pray that things work out,
her wedding is fixed today.
Now do you fix proposals
in the hospital as well?
Had I known earlier, I would have
got uncle treated here as well.
Anyway, you sit,
I will get the sweets.
Yes, just bring it quickly.
Okay. Okay
Yes, quickly.
Aunty,
you have performed ablution, right?
You will pray, right?
Just pray extra today,
and pray.
It is really important. Come,
we will also tell the rest.
Come on.
Okay tell me, did you give the patient
on bed 420.
Sister Anjum.
Sister Anjum, pray.
You people also pray.
The prayers of the nurses are answered soon.
We really need prayers right now.
Hey, what are you two doing?
Come on.
Aunty, you too pray, please.
Pray. All of you pray.
All that is fine, but
what are we praying for?
He knows…
What?
What happened?
Why are you praying?
Is some patient serious?
Why are you all praying?
Doctor, not the patient,
the patient’s granddaughter
is in serious condition.
We really need prayers.
You too pray.
We really need them.
Pray. Pray. Go ahead.
Pray. Pray.
Ameen.
Thank you.
Come on lets go.
Sister Anjum, what happened?
Something must have surely happened.
This Shehanshah is really lazy,
he doesn’t do anything properly.
This Rania is totally mad,
she also drives everyone else mad.
Oh wow,
who has driven my brother mad?
Rabail, right now I am really angry,
don’t joke with me.
I think the matter is really serious.
Listen to me,
you have to worry and
definitely don’t take any tension.
If there is any tension,
you just make one call to Rania,
she will fix all your issues.
Rania?
Don’t take Rania’s name
in front of me,
she is a completely mad girl.
Should I tell you?
Wait a minute.
The phone had to ring right now.
Hello Rania. Yes, Rania,
go ahead.
Oh, okay. Okay okay,
I will tell him. Okay bye.
Listen to me, you have forgotten
your phone there in your anger.
Argh!
Where are you going?
She will bring your phone.
She has said she has kept it safe.
I have no trust on this girl.
Hey, whatever home
such girls go to,
they ruin the peace and
comfort of that home.
And I feel that her Mian Jee
has sent her here on purpose,
that go, go and ruin the peace and
comfort of Mahir’s home completely.
What is wrong with you?
I don’t know what sort of things you say.
There is nothing like that.
It is like that.
I am speaking the truth.
Her Mian Jee must dance
there in Khushalpur
that thank God he got rid of her.
The problem has been avoided.
Listen to me,
you avoid her company.
Congratulations.
I got good news.
What happened?
Did the henna on the feet of
your husband gets removed?
Oh, I wish. I am not that lucky.
I just came to inform you that
Mona has gotten on the train.
Mona has gotten on the train?
Why?
To come here, and I am really happy.
What? Is Mona really coming?
Yes.
But why?
Why not? It is her sister’s home,
she too has a right.
Mahir, please go and
get her from the station,
she will really like it.
But I wont like it at all.
Forgive me aunt,
but it is a no from me.
Hey, why?
Hey that husband of yours,
who is always lying on the bed,
tell him to get her.
I have a lot of work to do.
I have a long list.
For example?
Example.
I have a lot of work. I don’t have
time to tell you right now.
And I am going, my phone has been
left in the hospital.
Make your husband get up.
He has lost his mind, and
I know well why he lost his mind.
Anyway, Mona is coming.
Yes, so what will Mona do?
When Mona comes,
she will tell herself what she will do.
Rabail, you know
what I am thinking?
I will pack my bags.
Arbab will be coming to pick me
at any moment.
Wow. Wow. Someone is really happy
to go home.
Obviously, I am going to my home.
It is good. May God always keep you
happy and you go home safely.
What are you talking about?
What are you two talking about? Huh?
Mama, sister is really happy
because brother Arbab will come
to pick her at any moment.
Yes, she should go.
She should go. Why not?
She should go to her home.
Now I am not stopping you.
I got them to agree what we wanted.
You were worried for no reason.
Hey, be brave like me.
Sure, grandma.
and Rabail child,
you too listen to me carefully.
Look, you too have to get married,
go to your in-laws,
you have to get married too.
There is something else,
girls don’t get respect being
submissive towards their in-laws.
They should stay strong.
Listen to me, Saman,
in future you don’t have to hesitate,
you don’t have to worry.
Yes, grandma.
Stay happy.
Yes.
You people are not having tea?
Ask for it.
I will just ask Shehanshah for it.
Shehanshah,
get tea for mama.
Oh.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Hey, what is wrong?
Where are these people?
Why do they have us waiting?
Whether they come or not,
I am sleeping.
Hey, aunty, come on.
Come on. Come inside.
Consider this your own room as well.
Come on. Come on.
The boy’s family is not here?
They must be on the way.
Grandma, these are our neighbours.
This is aunt Anila, and this…
This is her son Farhad.
Greetings. Greetings.
How are you?
I am fine. How are you?
How are you feeling?
Hey, what do I tell you?
So many ailments have surrounded me
in such a young age.
Now I am living in the hopes to see
the happiness of this child.
This! This is the pain we need,
grandma.
You have to speak the same dialogue
in front of Salik’s parents, with the same feel.
Full emotional, make everyone cry.
Ditto.
Rania. Rania. Rania. Rania.
Some people have come.
They were asking for
you on the reception.
I feel it is the boy’s family.
You know I am so excited,
this is the first time an engagement
is taking place in our hospital.
I want to get the drum.
Oh, my luck.
But that Dr. Wasiq,
he is a pain.
Hey, grandma, you lie down.
Why are you standing?
Quick. Quick. Quick.
Okay. Okay.
Create sadness and tension of your face.
see, like this?
Yes, like this. Absolutely. And make sounds
in pain. Sounds of pain.
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Aunty, you too make a sad face,
and sit in this corner.
I will do one thing, Rania,
I will also apply a drip.
Yes, put the drip.
Hey, no, no. No drip.
What are you doing? Eat it quickly,
and do one thing, take it,
take it to your room.
When I ask for it, bring it then.
Quickly. Farhad,
walk quickly. Bye.
Have you put the drip?
Oh God, ouch.
Listen, give her an injection.
Yes.
What is the injection for?
It will look like a drama, grandma.
Hey, don’t put it in,
I am really scared.
Yes, sister.
I just..
I just wanted to ask that
did I bother you too much?
She has a happy
go lucky temperament.
Hey brother Anwar,
what are you saying?
She is my own daughter.
If she bothers me,
I won’t mind it.
You know, can I say something?
She is a really good girl.
Really respecting.
There was no misbehaviour,
she didn’t do any mischief either.
You have brought her up well.
You just have to do one thing, that you
get her admitted in a university soon.
That poor thing went
with this intention.
It is her dream and ours too.
We will get her admitted.
We will.
Once the admissions are open,
we will get her admitted.
Why do you worry?
I just wanted to say it.
Is everything else fine?
Yes.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Yes. Goodbye. Goodbye.
Breathe.
grandma.
Breathe.
Grandma.
Yes?
Can you breathe?
Uncle, aunty,
we are thankful to you
that you people came.
Hey, Salik told us that
Ifrah’s grandma is unwell.
By the way, tell us
what happened to her?
What is her ailment?
She..uncle..that…
if she has one ailment
I will tell you uncle.
Now grandma just has one wish.
She says that she wants
to see Ifrah get married.
She doesn’t want anything else.
She is really sad.
Sad.
By the way,
I don’t see Ifrah’s parents.
They went to Dubai for the first time.
We thought why bother them?
So we didn’t inform them.
First time?
We had heard that Ifrah is
from a well-off family.
Err..
err...
yes, they are really rich people.
Actually, they go to France
for shopping,
so they suddenly got the idea
that they have not been to Dubai,
so they went to Dubai.
Oh, I see.
You?
How are you related to Ifrah?
Neighbour.
The room next door is ours,
my daughter is admitted.
And what are you to them?
Me? I am their neighbour.
They are all neighbours here.
Does she not have anyone
her own here?
Alone,
lonely,
unwell,
helpless, poor.
Oh.
Oh. Oh.
You people sit, please.
Come. Sit. Sit. Sit.
No child, nothing like that.
We are with her.
So sweet aunty.
Hey see, Ifrah
and Salik are friends,
so it is our responsibility
that we take care of mama.
Absolutely.
You said something great uncle.
Wow.
Now if you have a good proposal
for our innocent IFrah,
do tell us.
The thing is that mama just once…
once wants to see her
Ifrah dressed as a bride.
The God knows
when she will depart.
We are short on time.
Yes, yes, child, sure, why not?
I will surely tell you.
in fact, Salik has a friend,
what is his name, son?
Mahir. Mahir.
Yes, Mahir.
He is a really good boy,
if mama asks me,
I can get Ifrah wedding fixed there.
Aunty, you keep your update to yourself.
that..,
I…
I…
I am Mahir’s…
fiancee.
What?
You are Mahir’s fiancée?
Yes.
Look at that boy,
he doesn’t get tired calling me aunt,
and he hid something so big from us.
I didn’t know he is engaged.
Mahir is a little shy and
gets worried easily.
So he doesn’t say much.
Or else he got after me
and got engaged.
Let him come now.
You will see I will teach him
a lesson he won’t forget.
He hid something so big from me.
I will mind it if I stay alive
after making this statement.
Mahir will kill me.
Papa, don’t let go of this chance
to do a good deed.
Return the breaths to a dying patient.
Today…
Today if you don’t ask for Ifrah’s hand,
then I will ask for Ifrah’s hand
for my neighbour’s son.
and I can do this.
You have one and only son
will live his life mourning and
suffering like a failed lover.
Child, you don’t understand.
This is not my issue.
Actually, Salik’s mother is against
marriage based on liking.
What?
This was the issue?
I will have to think of something, man!
Where is my daughter?
Hey, my child, greetings.
Welcome.
Hey, are you good?
Saman.
Why don’t I see you?
Because papa she has not come
from mama’s home.
God be kind. Did sister
increase her demand?
There is nothing like that papa.
Then why didn’t she come?
Because I didn’t go to get her.
And nor do I plan on going.
Hey, don’t talk in riddles.
When I don’t know the answer
to a riddle my whole body starts to itch.
And I want to scratch the face
of the person in front of me,
or I kick the person next to me
and send them out of the room.
Don’t talk in riddles.
Papa, I want a support in my good
and bad times in form of a wife,
what will I do with this worshiper
of wealth? Huh?
And the condition they have put for
the property, they have disrespected my love.
I won’t go to get her.
Here we go, a new issue.
Brother Arbab,
sister in law really loves you,
in fact, she…
You be quiet,
you don’t know anything about
the matters of the heart.
Papa, I won’t.
Hey, now I will show you my anger.
You cannot tolerate the beating
at the hands of my branded sandal.
You will go and
get my daughter in law.
Hey, this is the question of my,
Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad’s, respect.
What will they think,
the sister who is proud
of her family’s respect,
that I just asked to put a small portion of
the wealth in the name of my daughter in law,
and Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad Juman
couldn’t do it.
Hey, you will have to go,
or you will be a victim of my wrath!
Arbab!
Arbab!
How long have we been here for?
She has not come to her
senses even once.
Why don’t you take her
to another doctor.
Yes, we will,
but first this issue should get resolved.
What issue?
This.
No. No.
Will you have juice?
No. I…I…
Rania, who do I need to feed
the sweets to?
You.
We need to feed the sweets
to you. Eat.
What? The proposal hasn’t been
fixed yet?
They are worse than our thinking,
how will we fix the proposal?
Do something.
What?
Madam, why don’t you understand?
Don’t be so stubborn.
Salik likes Ifrah and then,
we should respect our child’s desire.
Ifrah is a good girl,
agree to me wife of mine. Agree.
Aunty,
uncle, I have heard you
two whispering.
Aunty,
whatever uncle is saying is right.
You won’t get a girl like Ifrah anywhere,
I am telling you.
Not at all.
You know what happens
in a love marriage,
if you and I had gotten
married out of love,
then till now we would
have been divorced.
Here we go,
now no learned man has
the cure for superstition.
Then, I…
I will leave then.
I have to go to room 420 to mourn.
Why?
What happened there?
What do I tell you, uncle?
What do I tell you?
It is a really sad story,
my heart hurts telling it.
A boy was admitted there,
it must be our Salik’s age.
The same laughing, smiling face.
He fell in love with an innocent girl
like Ifrah.
But his mother was just like aunty.
She stood in the way
like the cruel world.
She said loves marriages don’t
have happen in our family.
Then what?
The wedding got canceled.
So what is there to be sad in this?
It is something to be sad about.
It is something to be sad about, aunty?
The thing is the boy got an ailment,
the poor thing died.
Now you think yourself?
Young…
the parents are taking the dead body
of their young child,
you need to mourn.
Of course,
you should mourn.
I will leave then, okay?
Oh seeing Salik’s face
I remembered,
I will get the doctor’s name
and number.
God forbid, if you need it tomorrow.
You should have all the information,
right uncle?
Okay. Fine,
then I will leave now.
I…
I…
I am going.
She is going.
You stop her.
I am going.
She is leaving, I would say take it…
I mean think about it.
I am gone.
Wife of mine, stop her. Please.
Stop.
I don’t want any doctor’s number,
may God give life to my son.
Ameen.
Move.
I accept Ifrah.
Now she will be my Salik’s wife.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Sweets. Sweets. Sweets.
What is this noise?
Is some patient in a serious condition?
Move.
No, no, sir if you go to this room,
then along with the patient’s family,
my condition will also become serious.
Hey, move out of my way.
Move, let me go.
Sir, to go in this room,
you will have to cross my dead body.
Sister Anjum, what is the drama?
What is this?
When I go inside I will know
what is happening inside. Move.
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
Move. Move. I will go and see.
Sir. Sir, Dr. Zeeshan is calling you
in the ICU. Come quickly sir.
Yes. Yes sir, there is an emergency,
that’s the thing. Go. Yes.
Hey, sir come on.
What is the problem?
Come on. Come on.
Hey, hero.
How are you?
Hey, you are really lucky that
you got such an amazing fiancée.
No. No, uncle no.
You will have to eat another Lado.
Hey, I have eaten three already.
I cannot have anymore.
Hey have the fourth as the last one.
With difficulty.
Hey, no you will feed me.
Please. Please, this, last.
Hey mama, congratulations to you.
Look at her, she was saying no.
Congratulations to you.
Congratulations?
Hey, you are here?
Open your mouth.
What is this?
Gulab Jamun.
That I know, I am asking
about this drama.
This is not a drama,
I had told you that
I will set Ifrah and Salik,
so their proposal has been finalized.
Congratulations to you too.
What is happening?
The wedding date?
So soon? Yes.
Yay!
It will be fun.
