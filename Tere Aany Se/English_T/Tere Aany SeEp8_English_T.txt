[00:46] Hey.
[00:50] What happened to you? Get up.
What happened? Come to your senses.
[00:54] Oh God. Water.
[00:56] There is no water either. Get up.
Come to your senses. Is anyone there?
[00:58] Brother.
[01:00] Get up. Is anyone there?
Someone there?
[01:03] Get up. What happened to her?
Why has she fainted? Get up.
[01:06] Uncle. Uncle, come quickly.
Come and see, quickly.
[01:23] Who is that child?
I am sure she is your sister.
[01:26] How did she faint?
[01:27] You tell me, how is she?
Did she regain consciousness?
[01:30] All that will be told by Dr. Wasiq.
First you do one thing, pay the fees.
[01:36] I pay the fees?
[01:37] Have you seen my patient’s condition?
[01:40] Have you seen my condition?
I don’t have my phone or money.
[01:42] I myself went to get to the store to get chips.
I met her on the way.
[01:46] Have you seen her condition and
you are worried about the fees?
[01:48] D…doctor.
Doctor, how is she?
[01:52] Thank God you got her to the hospital in time.
[01:55] She is out of danger.
[01:56] Thank God. Can I meet her?
[01:58] In a while.
[01:59] She has not regained consciousness completely.
[02:01] Sister Anjum will tell you. Please.
[02:03] Okay fine.
Thank you.
[02:05] Are you satisfied now?
Go pay the fee quickly.
[02:17] Listen.
[02:19] Listen.
[02:20] You are Mahir’s friend, Ifrah, right?
[02:22] You are Mahir’s maid, right?
Is everything fine?
[02:26] I need your help.
[02:28] I have to make a call, I don’t have a phone.
[02:30] I don’t even remember
the phone number of anyone at home.
[02:32] You must have Mahir’s number, right?
[02:34] I will call him. Don’t worry.
[02:42] Hello. Yes, Ifrah, how are you?
[02:44] Yes, hi Mahir.
[02:46] Yes, yes, I am fine.
How is grandma?
[02:47] Grandma is a little unwell
She is still hospitalized. Listen to me.
[02:51] Your maid, she wants to talk to you.
[02:55] My maid? Who?
[02:57] You talk to her.
[03:00] Hello. Hello Mahir.
[03:02] The hospital you got me that day,
come there quickly.
[03:06] Rania, what are you doing there?
[03:08] A girl fainted on the way,
I have brought her to the hospital.
[03:12] I don’t have my phone or money,
I don’t even know her family.
[03:17] You please come quickly.
[03:19] Man. You are too much.
You are in the habit to get in trouble.
[03:23] Okay fine, you have got her to the hospital.
Come home quickly.
[03:27] How can I come like this?
[03:29] Okay fine, then don’t come. Suffer. I am busy,
I am going to the university. Bye.
[03:33] Mahir. Mahir.
[03:37] Such cruel and stonehearted
people exist in this world, man.
[03:41] What happened? Is he not coming?
[03:43] No.
[03:45] He is really selfish.
[03:48] He is not selfish, you are really sensitive.
[03:52] You don’t even know that girl.
[03:55] No.
[03:56] You are not related to her
[04:00] and you are still so worried for her.
[04:03] She is nothing to me,
[04:05] but she must be someone’s sister or daughter.
[04:08] Just like I am dear for my mother,
[04:10] the same way she too
must be dear for her mother.
[04:13] Congratulations,
your patient regained consciousness.
[04:15] Thank God. Can I meet her?
[04:17] Yes, you can meet her,
but first let us shift her to the room
[04:20] Yes, don’t talk to her for too long.
[04:22] How will this poor thing talk to her for long?
[04:24] She doesn’t know her.
She got her here out of humanity.
[04:28] Really?
[04:29] She was worried like she is really dear to her.
[04:38] Okay, I will just come.
[04:44] Give me this bill.
[04:48] I will pay it.
[04:50] Thank you.
[04:51] Thank you so much.
[04:53] It is okay.
[04:55] Excuse me.
[05:01] How are you?
[05:02] You are fine, now, right?
[05:04] I am fine. who are you?
[05:06] I am the one who got you to the hospital.
[05:08] okay, you go one thing,
give me the number of your family,
[05:10] I will call them and ask them to come.
[05:13] I don’t remember anyone’s number at home.
[05:15] You please, call my mama or brother.
[05:19] Okay. Okay. Don’t worry.
I will do something.
[05:23] You try to remember it comfortably,
you will remember something.
[05:28] Anything. You tell me,
do you live near to where you fell?
[05:34] Yes, I live in that area.
[05:36] Hey, I too live in that area.
[05:38] Can you tell me a landmark of your home?
[05:42] My home is in lane 2,
[05:44] the gate colour is brown,
and the neighbours is black.
[05:50] Is a carriage without a horse
parked outside your home?
[05:54] Yes. Yes.
[05:55] Your brother’s name is Farhad?
[05:57] Yes, yes, you please call brother Farhad.
[06:00] What happened?
[06:02] Child, how are you now?
[06:03] Rania, what happened to her?
How is the child, now?
[06:06] She is fine, and you know who she is?
She is your neighbours.
[06:09] These people in the city are so weird,
so unaware of people around them.
[06:13] What? This child is our neighbour?
[06:15] Yes, now that you have come,
[06:17] go call mama and tell her to give a message
to Farhad that his sister is in the hospital.
[06:23] I will. I will. Child, don’t worry,
I am informing at your home. Okay?
[06:26] Yes, he is calling.
All of them will come just now.
[06:28] Hey, what are you doing here?
Come on, go out. she needs to rest.
[06:32] Oh, right now, don’t worry, rest.
[06:37] Your family must be on the way.
Okay? I am outside.
[06:42] Child, are you fine now?
[06:44] Yes.
[06:47] Yes. Yes. Yes, grandma, I have reached.
[06:49] You tell uncle to go and inform them.
[06:52] Fine. No, nothing to worry about.
[06:55] No, Rania is also here.
[06:56] Okay.
[07:01] I have told them, nothing to worry about.
[07:04] Did you not have a class?
[07:06] I did, but I suddenly remembered that
if you get involved with the police and court,
[07:13] then who will have to run around?
[07:15] Me.
[07:16] That is why I left my class
and came here for you.
[07:22] I have informed her family,
those people will come soon.
[07:25] Let’s go.
[07:26] No, no, I am not going anywhere,
till her family comes.
[07:29] I cannot leave her alone and go like this.
[07:35] Fine. Let’s stay here then.
[07:46] See, you have come after her.
[07:48] You couldn’t resist.
[07:50] I had told you, I understand everything.
[07:53] It is the matter of the heart.
[07:59] Matter of the heart?
[08:24] These people,
[08:25] I don’t know what they would think.
[08:28] I don’t know how long
we will have to stand guard for her.
[08:35] Oh hey, hello.
[08:37] What is the scene?
[08:39] We informed her family a long time back,
till now no one came asking for her.
[08:43] How long do we have to wait?
[08:44] They don’t give helicopters on rent.
[08:47] We informed them thirty minutes back,
those poor people cannot come flying.
[08:52] If you want go somewhere,
then you can go.
[08:55] if you are here because of me,
then don’t wait. I will come myself.
[08:58] Hello.
[08:59] Keep your advice to yourself.
[09:01] I know you.
[09:03] If I leave you at any corner of the world,
[09:05] you will come back.
[09:07] I am sitting here, not because of you,
[09:10] I care about grandma,
that is why I am waiting.
[09:13] Then do this favour to grandma too,
no need to say anything to me.
[09:17] Look, you…
[09:18] Hi Mahir.
[09:20] Oh, hi.
[09:22] Hello.
[09:23] How is your patient?
[09:24] She is fine.
[09:26] I have to thank you again.
[09:28] Had you not been there,
[09:29] that poor thing wouldn’t have been treated.
[09:32] Thank you.
[09:33] Man, don’t embarrass me and
Mahir how did you come?
[09:37] You had said you won’t come.
[09:39] I didn’t have to come.
[09:40] But I am out of mind that
I came here when she asked me.
[09:44] I have not even had a cup of tea since morning,
I am hungry, guarding this girl.
[09:48] I don’t know when her family will come.
[09:50] You have got such a good maid.
[09:54] She is so caring,
she has such a good heart.
[09:57] You don’t get such servants nowadays.
[09:59] What is your name?
[10:01] My name.
[10:02] You ask him for my name.
[10:04] Now I don’t know
what he would like to name me.
[10:08] So what name did you decide for me, Mahir?
[10:10] What do you mean?
[10:12] Ifrah, actually, man,
[10:14] that day…
[10:17] she is not my maid, she is my cousin.
[10:20] Distant.
[10:21] Distant cousin.
[10:22] You spoke such a big lie to us, Mahir.
[10:25] I am sorry. But why?
[10:27] Hey, man…
[10:28] Because he feels that if makes a simple girl
who wears simple clothes his relative,
[10:35] then his respect will be reduced.
[10:36] People will look down on him.
His own friends.
[10:39] And then his name and position will get affected.
[10:42] And it is possible he will stop getting proposals.
[10:44] Yuck. Is this how you think?
And what proposals are you getting?
[10:48] Hey, what is wrong with you?
Who are you listening to?
[10:51] Yes, this is how he thinks.
[10:53] He feels that a person doesn’t have respect,
his money, wealth and property have respect.
[10:56] Quiet. You be quiet.
Don’t you see the environment?
[10:59] We are in the hospital.
You don’t see the place, and you start.
[11:01] I start? And what about you
murmuring for so long?
[11:04] If this was not a hospital and our home,
then I would have showed you stars in the day.
[11:07] Hello, keep these stars in your pocket.
If I lose my mind, it won’t be good.
[11:31] Here. Mama, come here.
[11:33] Rania, how is my sister?
[11:36] Yes, she is fine now. She is out of danger.
[11:38] Thank God.
[11:40] Farhad, take me to my daughter.
[11:42] Yes.
[11:42] I will take you.
[11:43] I have made good contacts in the hospital
in this time, no one will stop us.
[11:47] Child, is my Laiba fine?
Has she regained consciousness?
[11:50] Yes. Yes, she is conscious.
[11:52] But you people thank God,
you got out of a big trouble.
[11:57] Give charity aunty.
[11:58] Thank God.
[12:00] Child, thank you so much,
or else who helps others nowadays.
[12:04] No matter if anyone does it or not, I do it.
[12:06] If a person doesn’t help another,
how will the problems be solved?
[12:10] Come on, I will take you. the room is there.
[12:12] come on. Come on.
[12:14] Hey, what?
[12:16] What? Why are you going inside with them?
[12:18] Let me make them,
you are not missing your train.
[12:20] Now you will also make them meet?
[12:23] Laiba.
[12:25] Laiba, child, what happened to you?
How are you now? Are you fine now?
[12:29] Yes, mama, I am fine.
[12:31] I don’t know how all this happened.
[12:34] You know,
[12:35] she is the one who got me to the hospital.
[12:38] Yes, child, I cannot repay her favour.
[12:43] Child, what is your name?
[12:44] Oh,
[12:45] the times are so bad,
[12:47] neighbours know nothing about neighbours.
[12:50] Hey, she is our neighbour.
[12:53] Her uncle came to inform us about Laiba.
[12:56] Yes, you come to our Khushalpur some time.
[12:59] It seems like the walls in the home
in our village are just a formality.
[13:03] The neighbours seem like family.
[13:05] If someone gets pricked in someone’s home,
the whole neighbourhood reaches there.
[13:10] You seem to be from a really liberal village.
[13:13] Yes, a lot.
[13:14] If this was our Khushalpur,
[13:16] the whole hospital would have
been filled with the neighbours.
[13:20] Mama, I want water.
Water?
[13:26] Hey, what happened?
[13:27] Why did you stop?
[13:28] Please continue.
[13:30] What were you saying,
the crowd of the neighbours.
[13:32] Yes. From there. From there.
[13:32] Yes, so …
She is right.
[13:34] nowadays we consider it unimportant
to stay in touch with each other.
[13:39] Mama, our neighbours are really good,
if you go to their home, you will be really happy.
[13:43] You will be a fan of mama when you meet her.
[13:45] When Laiba comes home from the hospital,
I will surely go to meet them.
[13:50] Child, you didn’t tell me your name.
your name?
[13:52] I have a good name.
[13:54] You will really like it. Rania.
[13:56] Rania Ahmed.
[13:57] My Mian Jee named me. it so good right?
[13:59] Rania, your name is really beautiful.
[14:03] Child, I will go to thank your mother myself.
[14:06] She has brought you up so well.
[14:09] Taught you to help others.
[14:11] For that you will have
to come to our village, Khushalpur.
[14:15] You must have seen the change in this
man’s dressing and my dressing, right? See.
[14:20] Actually, I am her distant close relative.
Actually, he is your neighbour.
[14:27] Greetings aunt.
[14:28] Greetings son, live long.
[14:30] They are great people.
[14:33] Happy, educated.
[14:35] Someone with a great past and future.
[14:38] Aunty. Aunty, now that you are here,
you take care of her.
[14:42] We were waiting for you.
We will go now. We will go. right?
[14:47] Thank you so much, child. Goodbye.
[14:49] I will come again tomorrow.
Yes, yes, child do come.
[14:51] In fact, if you want,
I will send food with Mahir…
[14:54] Okay, aunty. Okay.
Okay child, take care of yourself.
[14:56] Okay aunty. Thank you. Okay, goodbye.
[14:59] Sister we have happy looking poor
people living in our neighbourhood.
[15:02] Think about it.
[15:07] Why did you pull me?
[15:08] Could you not have waited
for two minutes? I was talking.
[15:10] I know what you were talking about.
[15:12] You wanted to stay there,
[15:15] and people praise you and you enjoy that.
[15:17] Hah, I don’t need to do that at all.
[15:19] People praise me just like that.
[15:21] I was just telling Farhad’s mother not to worry, I will…
[15:25] I will clean their home.
In fact, I will clean it completely, right?
[15:28] Don’t say this again.
[15:30] Once I get angry,
I don’t care where I am.
[15:33] I was telling them that
I would send them food.
[15:36] Oh, you have made me hungry
further by mentioning food.
[15:39] I have been hungry for so long, anyway.
[15:42] It is really late, I had no idea.
[15:44] Even I am really hungry.
[15:46] I was mad.
[15:47] I was asking you to come
along for so long, but no.
[15:51] So what? It is our city,
we have a car, we will go now.
[15:57] Fine, first let’s eat something then we will go home.
[15:59] What will you feed me?
[16:01] I will see when we go forward.
[16:02] We will have restaurant,
salad or steak, we will see.
[16:18] Stop. Stop. Stop.
What happened? What happened?
[16:21] Chaudary Dhaba,
[16:22] famous lentils from Khushalpur,
we will have this now.
[16:25] Are you in your senses?
[16:26] Do you see how bad the place is,
the food will be so bad.
[16:29] Let’s go forward,
we will eat at a good restaurant.
[16:32] Don’t say that about food.
If we eat here, we won’t die and I will eat here.
[16:37] Please Rania, what are you doing?
Stop. Come sit in the car. Rania.
[16:40] This girl is mad. Rania.
[16:58] Listen to me?
[16:59] Are you mad?
Where have you gotten off?
[17:02] Get up and sit in the car right now, hey,
we will get something on the way. Come on.
[17:05] Nothing happens, come on sit here.
We will get really good food here.
[17:10] If someone recognizes me, I will get insulted.
[17:15] Oh, brother.
[17:18] Greetings.
[17:18] Greetings. Okay listen,
get two plates of your special butter lentils,
[17:23] one chicken karahi, lets also get a chicken tikka,
three chapatis and two oiled flat breads. Okay?
[17:28] Hey, stop, stop, stop. What are you doing?
[17:30] Are you ordering for the whole village?
[17:31] Brother, what is the sweet dish?
Gulab Jamun.
[17:34] Gulab Jamun? That’s it?
[17:35] Okay then get the gulab jamuns too. Okay?
[17:37] Listen, two cup hot cardamom tea, with cream.
[17:41] Bring it quickly. I am really hungry.
[17:43] Why did you order so much?
Who will have four flat breads.
[17:46] When the food is served,
then it won’t be left. You will see.
[17:48] It is really delicious.
We also get this in our area.
[17:51] What if I get an upset stomach.
[17:54] Where are the children?
[17:56] Hamad call them.
[17:58] Oh mama, they have gone to the hospital,
it takes time. They will come.
[18:03] I don’t understand anything.
[18:05] Mahir went to the university,
[18:07] and Rania had gone to the corner shop
to get chips for the children.
[18:12] You are right mama,
but we will find out when they come.
[18:16] Let them come.
[18:17] I was thinking I will also go see
the neighbours’ girl at the hospital.
[18:23] Oh my, why will you go mama?
[18:26] Me and Hamad will go.
What do you say Hamad?
[18:28] If we get time we will go.
Come on. Come on.
[18:31] Do you hear your lazy son? If we get time.
[18:34] He talks like he is the busiest man in the world.
[18:37] What does he do?
[18:38] No, today, you tell mama and me
that what secret missions you go to.
[18:42] God knows what sin I committed
that I got married to this lazy person.
[18:47] Do you hear that? Do you hear that?
[18:50] I get insulted because of you so much. Huh?
[18:53] Stop it. Stop it. I will get you hired at a factory
that too on a double shift, then don’t cry.
[19:00] This is the solution for him. Huh?
[19:03] He doesn’t even move
and drink water. Huh?
[19:05] Tell me. When he does double shifts,
he will learn his lesson.
[19:09] Hey, no mama,
how dare I that I don’t listen to my wife.
[19:13] We will go to the hospital.
For sure. Absolutely.
[19:16] That’s better for you.
[19:23] I really enjoyed it. It was so much fun.
[19:25] What are you doing, man?
What sort of language are you using?
[19:27] We have people around us.
What will they think about us?
[19:30] They won’t think anything.
[19:31] The thing is people of
my class don’t think so much.
[19:34] Your respect won’t be on the line.
[19:36] Talk slowly.
Do you have a loud speaker in your mouth?
[19:41] Wow. It is so much fun.
[19:44] The food was so good and
the tea at the dhabba is different.
[19:47] Can we go now?
[19:48] Or do you want to eat food for
two to three hundred more people?
[19:50] Let me finish my tea.
[19:53] Don’t order butter milk after tea.
[19:55] Good idea.
[19:57] Mama, I am tired of eating this,
now serve food, I am really hungry.
[20:01] Listen, let the children come.
Hey, Rabail.
[20:04] Yes?
Where is saman?
[20:06] Take care of her.
[20:09] She sits in the corner as
the queen of emotions all the time.
[20:13] Can someone see her and say that
she is the granddaughter of a lion heart grandma like me?,
[20:19] Huh? But Rania takes up after me.
[20:24] Really mama, Rania is a great girl,
she is a pretty girl.
[20:32] God be kind, the children are
still not home. God be kind.
[20:37] Mama, why do you worry?
they will come in a while.
[20:39] Pass this nimco to me.
[20:44] Here you go.
[20:47] Shehansha, also have this.
[20:51] Thank you.
[20:56] Oh I ate so much,
[20:58] I am really sleepy, I don’t feel like driving.
[21:01] I told you to teach me driving for this day.
[21:03] If you had taught me today, then I would have driven
and you would have slept peacefully.
[21:07] But no.
[21:08] Okay listen.
Go ahead.
[21:12] Teach me driving from tomorrow,
I will learn fast.
[21:17] Me?
[21:18] I teach you driving?
[21:20] Isn’t it better that I pray today and pray to God,
that after today I never get your company.
[21:28] You know it is a different class
of people who sit with other people
[21:31] and improve their behaviour like them.
[21:32] Me being with you has made
no difference to you.
[21:35] Good people.
[21:41] Today is a damned day.
[21:43] You made me spend half my money at the hospital
[21:46] and you spent the remaining eating the food
for these two to three hundred people.
[21:51] I will check.
[21:54] Thank God, I have money for petrol.
[21:57] Yes, don’t cry.
[21:58] I will give back the money I took.
Rich for no reason.
[22:02] I am losing my mind, Rania!
Be quiet and sit.
[22:06] If you say a word, I will drop you off here.
[22:08] You are talking continuously.
Really?
[22:23] What is she doing?
[22:28] What are you doing?
Why are you ruining my respect?
[22:34] Now go home without me,
I am sitting here.
[22:37] I will tell you this that I don’t have any
money to get a cab and come home.
[22:41] Hey, talk slowly.
[22:42] Do you have a loud speaker in your mouth?
[22:44] People are looking,
I am being made a joke out of.
[22:46] Sit quietly in the car. Sit.
[22:48] You were really threatening me earlier.
[22:52] If you don’t sit in the car now,
[22:55] I will lift you up and throw you in the car.
[22:56] Really? Come on, lift me and throw me.
if you have the courage then pick me up.
[23:00] Talk slowly.
[23:03] Okay listen to me,
[23:05] I have a really bad headache.
[23:06] Please have mercy on my condition,
sit in the car.
[23:10] Please.
[23:11] Hey, for the sake of your Hoshyar, Khushalpur.
[23:15] Hey, for the sake of your Mian Jee,
sit in the car, please. Please.
[23:19] I have to become the prime minister,
[23:21] and once I sit in protest no damned
person can make me get up.
[23:26] But the person whose sake you gave me
is really big, so I will have to get up.
[23:29] Come on, get up.
[23:31] I can get up myself.
[23:37] No problem, she is a mental patient.
Poor mental patient. She is like that.
[24:00] Hello.
[24:02] Why are you yawning?
Sit alert or the driver will also fall sleepy.
[24:07] Please keep your eyes open when driving.
[24:09] You will die because of your mistake
and innocent me will also die.
[24:13] And right now, I don’t plan on dying.
[24:15] I have a lot of work to do.
[24:19] Greetings boss.

Are you in your senses?
[24:30] The one sitting next to you.
She is so pretty.
[24:35] First you get your eyes tested
and leave from here.
[24:39] I have lost my mind listening
to this nonsense since morning.
[24:42] Before I take out my anger on you,
go, leave from here. Run. Run.
[24:46] One minute.
[24:47] Who talks to children like this?
[24:49] Child, come here. Come here.
Hey, he…
[24:52] Loser.
[24:54] He is a little upset.
Show me, hey these are really pretty.
[24:58] Give me two.
[25:00] Hey, why are you getting two?
What will you do with these flowers?
[25:03] I will wear them, what else will I do?
[25:06] Pay him.
[25:21] Give him money.
[25:23] I am.
[25:25] How much is it for?
[25:26] Two. No in fact three hundred for one.
[25:27] What? Three hundred for one?
Are these flowers made of gold?
[25:32] The flowers are not made of gold,
but your wife is made of gold.
[25:35] Give it for her sake.
[25:36] That’s bad, children don’t watch too many films.
[25:39] And when did he buy them for me out of love,
I myself forcefully got them.
[25:44] Give the poor thing money.
[25:46] Go.
[25:47] Hey. Change. Change.
[25:49] What is wrong? Miser.
[25:53] It was worth fifty,
[25:55] you gave him five hundred.
[25:56] If this was not a signal,
I would have taught him a lesson.
[26:14] Thank God today ended.
[26:17] I am tired today.
[26:20] You didn’t know her,
[26:22] you didn’t even know the girl’s name
and we wasted today at the hospital.
[26:27] You know if you ask me, today was really sad.
[26:31] The poor girl reached the hospital
after the accident, but…
[26:35] Buy you really enjoyed it, right?
[26:38] You got praised. You got appreciated.
You gathered a lot of praises.
[26:43] Why are you saying
the same thing again and again?
[26:45] What do you mean?
[26:47] I help people to receive praises?
And I get famous.
[26:51] Exactly. You understand correct,
because this is the truth.
[26:55] What times have come?
[26:58] People form such misunderstandings about people.
[27:01] They don’t even fear God.
[27:02] Yes, so fine. What do we do now?
[27:04] Do you want go inside
or stand here and lecture me.
[27:07] Listen,
[27:10] today was already frustrating.
[27:12] Don’t go in front of grandma and complain.
[27:17] She will scold me,
[27:19] and right now I am in no mood to get scolded.
[27:25] Greetings.
[27:27] Greetings. Greetings.
Hey, you people took so long.
[27:32] Oh.

[27:35] Thank God she is fine.
[27:37] Thank God she didn’t get hurt badly.

put on garlands to welcome people?
[28:04] Hey, no aunt.

[28:18] Grandma, I am tired, I will rest for a while.
[28:21] Yes, son, go and rest. You must be tired.
[28:26] Hey look at that, everyone was so worried.
Mama was so worried.
[28:31] We are sitting hungry waiting for you,
we are waiting and here they have also eaten,
[28:36] brought garlands, put them on.
[28:37] They got so busy that
they didn’t bother calling home.
[28:40] Hey mama, I didn’t have my mobile
or else I would have surely called.
[28:44] Okay, no problem, child. No problem.
[28:47] You go and rest you must be tired.
[28:50] Yes.
[28:50] Tell me something.
How did you take that girl to the hospital?
[28:55] Huh? And how did you know
that she was our neighbour?
[28:59] I didn’t know. I helped her out of humanity.
[29:04] Now you don’t only help the people you know.
What do you say mama?
[29:07] This the upbringing of my family.
[29:12] They too are always ready to help humanity 24/7.
[29:17] You didn’t have a mobile, huh?
Then how did you call Mahir?
[29:21] You must have called from the hospital.
[29:24] This means, you remember Mahir’s number.
[29:29] I am hungry.
[29:31] Shall we serve food?
[29:34] Yes, serve the food. Son, serve food,
the children ate and came, so we…
[29:39] I have been saying for so long, I am hungry.
[29:43] I will also go rest, mama.
[29:45] Yes, child, you go and rest.
You must be tired.
[29:53] I have been saying this for so long that
pack your bags and come here, but no,
[29:57] Mona won’t be Mona if she listens to her sister.
[30:00] Hey sister, your in-laws are not running away,
it is my beloved friend’s wedding, I won’t miss it.
[30:09] Wow, even if you miss
the chance of your own marriage.
[30:13] Why is it so important tell me?
[30:16] If you don’t dance at the wedding then
will the wedding not be accepted.
[30:19] Or tell me if the boy’s family put a condition
that she has to dance on the wedding?
[30:24] Hey, you get really out in your anger.
[30:27] Okay, don’t worry, I will come.
[30:30] And yes, listen,
[30:32] give love to Mahir from me.
[30:35] Okay bye.
[30:37] Listen…
[30:42] Are you done?
[30:45] I had asked you to serve food.
[30:48] You eat food, enjoy feasts.
[30:51] This is the limit.
[30:53] I have been married to such a selfish,
worry free man.
[30:57] Do you have no worry of the future?
[30:59] Do you not worry?
IF you are worried about, then it is food.
[31:02] What is it? Why are you getting upset?
[31:04] Why are you taking out
someone else’s anger on me?
[31:07] Hamad, listen to me. did you see?
[31:10] Did you see or not? Huh?
Both of them came together.
[31:14] The hospital was just an excuse,
they had food,
[31:17] they had tea too and
he even bought garlands for her too.
[31:20] Yes, I saw a little.
[31:23] Then how can you be so satisfied?
[31:25] What else can I do? After all,
it doesn’t suit me to be dissatisfied on this.
[31:31] Oh man, Hamad,
tell me honesty, are you on drugs?
[31:36] Everything is happening right
under your nose, don’t you see it.
[31:40] I don’t understand,
I have this useless man here,
[31:43] and on the other her,
who can miss every chance of her marriage,
[31:47] but she will dance on her best friend’s wedding.
[31:50] Where am I stuck?
[31:52] Okay do one thing,
you stay stuck, I will eat myself.
[32:08] Check out her cunningness.
[32:10] She left with the excuse to get chips and biscuits,
he left with the university as an excuse, huh?
[32:15] Then both of them met.
[32:18] You can do what you want, Mahir.
[32:20] Son, you will get married to Mona,
or else my name won’t be Seema.
[32:30] Shehanshah, chop it thin,
you chop the chili really thick.
[32:34] Mama, you go and sit,
the breakfast will be ready in ten minutes.
[32:37] I was thinking child, Rania,
that the neighbours
[32:42] we have their mother and
daughter are at the hospital,
[32:44] so why don’t we send something
for them from here.
[32:47] Oh, it slipped my mind.
[32:51] Poor Farhad and his uncle will be alone at home.
[32:54] Yes.
[32:55] Let’s invite them here instead of sending something.
[32:58] Best.
[32:59] That’s better.
[33:00] Son, Shehansha,
you go and tell the neighbours
[33:05] that till the time your child and
their mother is at the hospital, they eat here.
[33:12] Listen, if they say no as a formality,
don’t come back with that face.
[33:16] Bring them over.
[33:18] Now I cannot bring them forcefully.
They are such big men, how will I lift them?
[33:22] I will come with you.
[33:24] Mama, don’t worry,
I will come back with them. Come on.
[33:27] Sister will you lift them up?
[33:28] Me saying it is enough.
I talk sweetly. Come on, now.
[33:33] Go, I will come after drinking juice.
[33:34] Your stomach is never full.
[33:36] You will drink juice and go.
[33:39] Shehansha come quickly now.
[34:08] Oh man, there is so much place,
but no, you have to collide with me.
[34:14] You roam around the home like a bull.
[34:15] Hey, hey, easy, I didn’t bump into you,
you bumped into me. Stupid girl.
[34:20] Who did you call stupid? Huh?
Who did you call stupid?
[34:23] I don’t have time right now
that is why I am not responding.
[34:25] When I get time,
I will tell you who is stupid.
[34:28] Shehansha,
[34:30] come on,
[34:31] we don’t have time for useless talk.
[34:33] She hurt my ear.
[34:36] I don’t know from
where she takes out that sound.
[34:38] She is a really good girl.
[34:42] Will I get breakfast in this home?
[34:44] Hey wait, we have guests coming over.
[34:46] Hey, now who else is coming to this home?
[34:49] Listen, the neighbours, I have told them that till
the time that girl and her mother are in the hospital,
[34:56] they should come and eat at our home.
[35:00] Very good.
[35:01] You feed them breakfast,

[35:55] but I am not that old in age that I can put a
hand on a girl’s head and wish her well.
[36:00] Don’t make me do these cheap things,
