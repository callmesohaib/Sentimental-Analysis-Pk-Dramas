[00:16] So how was the story?
[00:19] Okay now so let's have a
singing competition,
[00:22] I sing when I am really happy.
[00:24] Raise your hand,
whoever wants to sing first.
[00:27] You.
Me?
[00:30] Wasiq, I will go and
wait in your room.
[00:33] Okay?
Uncle,
[00:35] stay for a while
[00:37] the children would like it
and you might as well.
[00:44] Sure.
[00:47] Hey Rania, sing a song,
children are waiting.
[00:51] Are you guys waiting?
Then let's sing together.
[01:43] She gives a performance
wherever she goes.
[01:47] She loves to seek attention.
[01:50] Yay.
[01:56] Hey, Mahir, you?
Come on, join us.
[02:00] No thanks, I am having a sore throat.
[02:02] And you.
Sister Anjum,
[02:04] who are you talking to?
[02:06] Have even heard his voice?
He sounds like a broken drum.
[02:12] Children, children, children,
when this uncle sings,
[02:15] it sounds like a crow
making a sound.
[02:20] And, and, and, when he speaks,
it sounds like thunder.
[02:25] That's why he's just staring.
[02:34] Come on now, sit here.
Hey, Mahir, where are you going?
[02:37] She's only joking to make
the children happy.
[02:39] If you want to joke
to make children happy,
[02:42] then do that to each other,
not to me.
[02:45] And you,
[02:47] I'll only wait 5 minutes
for you in the car,
[02:49] if you get there in time then okay,
else goodbye.
[02:54] Really?
[02:56] This is what it is, then go
[02:59] and attend grandmother's lecture,
[03:02] you know how you'll get scolded
if you go back alone.
[03:06] Now why are you standing here?
Go, go.
[03:08] You've trapped grandmother
in your enchantment,
[03:11] she is naive, she cannot understand it.
[03:15] Really? Then thank God,
you understood.
[03:18] Yes, I've understood really well.
[03:21] Are you coming or should I leave?
[03:28] Sorry children, I'll have to go.
[03:31] But all of you make me a promise
that you'll take care of yourself.
[03:36] Promise?
[03:38] Good.
Okay then I should leave.
[03:40] Bye.
Bye.
[03:42] I'll visit again.
[03:47] Dr. Wasiq, I'm leaving.
[03:51] Thank you for coming Rania.
[03:53] You responded to my first call.
[03:55] And see how all the children have smiles
and hope on their faces because of you.
[04:00] Thank you for coming.
[04:03] You'll visit again?
Definitely.
[04:05] It was good to meet you, uncle.
[04:08] Now she'll fool this uncle as well.
[04:11] Drama queen,
she doesn't spare anyone.
[04:15] I hope to meet you again.
[04:17] Hopefully.
[04:26] Take care of yourself.
[04:30] Bye.
Bye.
[04:36] Let's go?
[04:40] Bye.
[04:42] Bye.
[05:04] I don't know why
I don't like anything
[05:07] when this useless person
is mad at me.
[05:18] You really enjoyed?
[05:21] To sit in the middle of everyone
and sing horribly?
[05:24] Those children were sick.
[05:26] They're staying in such a depressing
environment at the hospital.
[05:28] If we had some fun to get rid of their
hopelessness then what's wrong with that?
[05:32] So what am I saying about it?
[05:35] I have nothing to do with this.
[05:37] If you don't have anything to do with this
then why are you showing this attitude?
[05:40] Anyways, I get annoyed
by upset faces,
[05:45] so please kindly make
your mood better.
[05:47] My mood is quite alright, okay?
[05:49] Whether you sing or
dance like monkeys,
[05:51] it really doesn't matter to me.
[05:53] And who was the man you were
wanting to meet again?
[06:03] Look here, tell me,
who was he?
[06:05] I liked his daughter for you,
wanting to get you married to her.
[06:10] Have you ever answered sanely
to any question?
[06:13] Have you ever asked a sane question?
[06:15] You always ask me questions
that make me mad.
[06:17] Don't forget, your grandfather
sent you here for studies,
[06:22] not for participating in
extracurricular activities.
[06:25] And that Wasiq? That doctor.
[06:29] I dislike him from the first day.
[06:31] Who do you even like?
[06:32] And how much do you know Dr. Wasiq?
[06:34] You are saying as if
he's your childhood friend.
[06:37] And that uncle too.
[06:39] That uncle is a fraud as well.
[06:40] I won't hear a single thing about him.
Do you understand?
[06:43] Looking at you I am reminded of
an old lady in my area.
[06:46] So?
[06:47] You're like her,
[06:50] she didn't like anyone either,
she criticized everyone, opposed everyone.
[06:55] You're like that too.
[06:57] If you miss that old lady or her uncle,
I don't care.
[07:00] Do it in your heart, silently,
I don't want to hear that voice in my ears.
[07:10] If my father were alive,
[07:12] he would be exactly like him,
[07:14] same face, and the same age.
[07:17] How decent and sweet he is.
[07:19] I don't know when will I get
to meet him again.
[07:27] She actually got quiet.
[07:30] Hope she doesn't complain
when we reach home.
[07:32] I have to make alliances better,
let me ask for the ice cream.
[07:35] She's greedy for that,
she'll say yes instantly.
[07:43] Listen?
[07:46] Do you want to have ice cream?
No, and don't disturb me again.
[07:50] I want to stay quiet for a while,
you should also drive silently.
[08:08] Rabail's in-laws want to have
a grand celebration for the wedding.
[08:13] What? Really?
[08:15] God, it'll be so much fun.
[08:17] Hey mother, maintain a relationship.
[08:21] But I'm telling you, don't hold
any celebration until I return.
[08:26] I'm returning this time, secretly.
[08:29] You have been giving the same hopes for
the last 20 years but you never returned.
[08:33] Telling you, mother, this time I am returning,
definitely returning, very soon.
[08:38] And I'll land directly at your feet,
in my paradise.
[08:42] It'll be so much amusement and entertainment,
we'll have so much fun,
[08:45] why did you send Mona so early?
[08:47] I was going to talk to uncle Dabeer about
the marriage of that Prince Charming and Mona.
[08:52] But Mona left,
who gives up that easily?
[08:54] Seema, come here, come here,
fast, come on.
[08:58] Here, talk to your brother-in-law,
[09:00] but don't act like stupids, you don't
show your face or forehead.
[09:04] Greetings brother Dabeer,
how are you? Alright?
[09:07] Greetings, Seema, live long.
[09:10] How are you? Alright?
And how is my idiot brother?
[09:17] Hello, listen,
[09:19] if you try to plan anything
by enchanting my father.
[09:24] So keep in mind,
[09:27] I'll get you married to uncle Rafique's son,
that lizard Khawar.
[09:33] Cunning.
[09:34] You're always making
strategies against me,
[09:37] always wishing for my downfall.
[09:40] I'll fix you,
[09:42] let the right time comes.
[09:44] Brother Dabeer, everyone
misses you so much here,
[09:47] we really feel your absence.
[09:49] Just return soon,
[09:51] and see how your brother has managed
the whole house.
[09:56] He took each and every responsibility
of this house on his delicate shoulders.
[10:01] That's a lot.
[10:03] Oh, by the grace of God,
you've told me a great news.
[10:09] Greetings uncle, how are you?
[10:11] Greetings, my child Rania,
[10:14] how are you? Is everything alright?
[10:16] Your uncle is coming back soon.
[10:20] To Pakistan.
[10:21] Okay tell me, what does my child want?
What should I bring you from here?
[10:25] No I.
Oh yes, father,
[10:27] bring her an extra tongue while returning.,
[10:30] Her own isn’t enough
for her speaking skills.
[10:32] Hey? Fair monkey,
you’re here as well?
[10:35] Tell me how are your injuries now,
everything alright?
[10:39] Injuries healed a long time ago,
[10:41] but the brain still hasn’t recovered yet.
[10:42] It seems like even the warranty
has ended for that.
[10:45] You are correct.
[10:47] Father, actually I.
Hey, father.
[10:50] Brother Dabeer,
bring a lot of chocolates.
[10:55] Yes, all the greedy ones are here,
waiting for you,
[10:58] come soon with all the stuff.
Father.
[11:03] Even if you don’t bring the perfumes,
chocolates.
[11:09] Open your mouth Mano.
[11:10] What happened?
[11:12] Finish your breakfast fast
you are getting late for school.
[11:15] Mother why do we have to eat
boiled eggs in the morning?
[11:19] No Tipu, I think you’d be getting
beating instead of egg.
[11:22] Aunt, I’ll make them eat the breakfast,
they listen to me.
[11:27] Sure?
Sure.
[11:29] Thank God.
[11:30] Come on children, start eating.
Tell me what do you want to eat? Cake?
[11:34] Yes.
Here you go.
[11:36] What do you want?
Cake.
[11:39] Good boy, here you go eat fast.
[11:41] Wait a second.
Did you recite Bismillah?
[11:44] Good job, and we should never
throw tantrums while eating.
[11:47] We should just thank God
and start eating.
[11:50] Okay? Eat now.
[12:08] I made such a healthy soup,
it’s a crab soup.
[12:10] Only the fortunate ones get
to have a soup made by me.
[12:14] Okay now open your mouth,
fast, fast, good job.
[12:45] Hello?
[12:46] Who are you remembering
so early in the morning?
[12:48] You are also smiling while remembering.
[12:51] No, nothing.
[12:55] You won’t understand.
[12:56] I don’t understand? Okay then, let it go.
[12:59] Have your breakfast it’s getting cold.
[13:05] Rania,
[13:07] can you pass me the tea?
[13:16] Cake too.
[13:26] There is an egg too, pass me that as well.
[13:32] What happened?
Is your mind alright,
[13:35] you are asking me for everything.
[13:40] Seeing you, taking care
of everyone like this,
[13:44] it reminded me of my mother.
[13:49] Nobody gave me food like this,
[13:52] nobody took care of me,
[13:54] nobody cares about the small things.
[14:02] Sorry,
[14:04] I should get the car keys,
[14:06] then I will have to drop you guys at school.
[14:09] It looks like brother Mahir
is missing his mother.
[14:12] Aww,
[14:14] a child without mother,
[14:16] who knows what he has
hidden in his heart,
[14:20] really,
[14:21] nobody can love like a mother.
[14:25] He doesn’t have a mother, that’s why
he’s off the rails sometimes.
[14:33] Children, if you are done with breakfast,
should we leave?
[14:35] Yes, go safely, return safely.
[14:38] Come on.
Come on Tipu.
[14:40] Wait a second, wait a second, stop,
stop, stop. Thank God I remembered.
[14:52] Done, now go.
[14:54] Bye.
[14:56] Come on, kids let’s go.
[14:58] And yes,
[15:00] so finish your lunch, don’t forget.
[15:03] Yes.
[15:08] He’s missing his mother
so early in the morning.
[15:13] The way I miss my father,
[15:17] he feels the absence of his mother.
[15:22] Both of us have emptiness in our lives.
[15:26] Our sorrow is alike.
[15:40] So here we go Rafique Ahmed,
[15:43] me and Rabail’s mother-in-law together,
are going to arrange a grand event.
[15:47] So that people get to know that
[15:50] Azra Jahan does not get her children
married off to some ordinary families.
[15:57] And now you’re also
a part of our family.
[16:00] Sister, you call so here I am,
[16:04] because this useless son of mine
embarrassed me a lot.
[16:09] I’m not even able to show
my face somewhere.
[16:12] No, no, uncle,
there is nothing like that.
[16:15] Look at it, it’s actually good
from one perspective.
[16:18] See how our Rabail got such a nice boy.
[16:20] If she had gotten together with Khawar
so what would the world say?
[16:23] They’d express disappointment.
[16:25] Rafique Ahmed, don’t be disheartened.
[16:28] Considering how rich Khawar is,
he’ll get a lot of proposals.
[16:33] Why are you getting worried?
[16:34] He’ll be happy if he marries
someone of his choice.
[16:37] I asked a lot, sister,
[16:39] but he says I’ve always addressed
all the girls as my sisters
[16:44] because all the girls only want that
from me, nothing else.
[16:51] That’s inferiority complex,
[16:56] it’s not even that bad Khawar,
what happened?
[16:59] I’m here, I’ll look for a girl for Khawar.
[17:02] I’ll tell them his car model and bank balance
before showing his face,
[17:06] then we’ll see many proposals he’ll get.
[17:08] No, no, there is no need for many,
we have our Mona.
[17:11] We can get Mona married to Khawar.
[17:16] Mona, you gave such a great idea.
[17:21] Good idea, very good idea.
[17:22] Listen, you were telling me that
Mona is getting committed?
[17:25] No, no, it was just about to,
not married yet,
[17:29] and Khawar is stronger
financially anyway.
[17:32] How can Mona find
an amazing guy like Khawar?
[17:36] We can’t find him.
[17:38] Consider it yes from our side.
[17:40] I’d suggest you all to think again,
[17:42] because if my relationship
fails a second time,
[17:44] I will get defamed and
nobody will marry me.
[17:46] Listen Seema, ask Mona first,
discuss it at your home,
[17:52] think about it,
it’s a matter of a girl’s life.
[17:56] I’d suggest you get his information.
[17:58] The decision has been made mother,
[18:00] and Mona is my younger sister
I will say and she’ll agree.
[18:02] Is such a nice, rich, wealthy guy,
it’s okay if he has a few flaws.
[18:08] Here we go sister, we formed
another relation with your family.
[18:13] Congratulations.
Congratulations.
[18:17] May God save us.
[18:19] Did she make a decision
about my marriage?
[18:23] Congratulations.
Congratulations.
[18:26] Congrats it’s a good thing.
The relationship is fixed,
[18:28] congratulations to you.
[18:31] Khawar and Mona’s.
[18:33] Here my child, congratulations to you.
[18:36] Many congratulations to you.
[18:40] Once again I will be a
son-in-law to this family.
[18:44] Sit straight, you son-in-law of the family.
[18:47] I’ll go and inform Mrs. Khawar.
[18:50] Yes, yes.
[18:52] Come Mahir, sit here.
[18:57] Here, eat something.
Yes, yes, have a snack.
[19:07] Hammad.
[19:08] Give me your phone fast, fast.
[19:12] Here it is, pick it up.
[19:22] Hello Mona, I have such
a great news for you,
[19:26] I did not only find a really rich,
wealthy, innocent and naive guy for you,
[19:31] I also decided on your relationship with him.
[19:34] But why,
[19:36] I did inform you the proposals here
are also about to be finalized.
[19:39] It was about to happen there,
it has already happened here.
[19:44] He’s so rich, house, properties,
mansions, cars.
[19:49] You’ll have a luxurious life.
[19:52] You are fortunate, fortunate.
[19:54] There is only one truth in this world,
money.
[19:57] Now look at me a useless, lazy person
is tied to me, now my life is ruined.
[20:04] You, my love, you are fortunate.
[20:06] Well tell me one thing, how did you
suddenly find a proposal for me?
[20:11] Or did Mahir agree?
[20:14] No, no, no, no, good looking prince
like Mahir aren’t good for marriage.
[20:21] Their wives are always
worried about them.
[20:25] Always having affairs here
and there.
[20:28] At the end, they end up becoming
a heart patient.
[20:31] That’s why I’ve chosen an extremely rich
but really innocent boy for you.
[20:36] A boy, girls don’t even
look at him twice.
[20:42] They call him brother as soon as
they see him.
[20:44] What?
[20:46] Who is he?
[20:48] What are you trying to do with me?
[20:50] I am your sister,
not your enemy,
[20:53] that’s why I have chosen a gem
like Khawar for you.
[20:58] What?
[21:00] That Khawar?
[21:02] Even Rabail doesn’t give him attention,
why are you giving him to me?
[21:06] Oh that stupid girl will regret later.
[21:09] Don’t think about Khawar,
[21:12] think about the shopping malls
across the world,
[21:15] where you will go to shop.
[21:17] And listen once you get rich
don’t forget your poor sister.
[21:22] Now hurry, book the tickets
and come, okay?
[21:25] Love you.
[21:26] Okay that’s fine but,
hello, listen to me.
[21:30] Oh God, what do I do now?
[21:33] When did this happen,
nobody asked me about it?
[21:37] At least now realize
your value in this home.
[21:40] Because you’re idle.
[21:55] My room, this tidy?
[21:58] Is this my room or someone else’s?
[22:00] No, it’s your room,
I clean it myself,
[22:04] changed a few things too.
[22:06] Hope you don’t hate it.
[22:08] No.
[22:10] Actually, I wanted to apologize
to you for my behavior earlier.
[22:18] Tea?
[22:19] You’ll have tea? I’ll make one for you,
without sugar?
[22:22] Let me get it for you.
[22:34] Hello? Yes, Salik how are you?
[22:37] Oh, I’m pretty good.
[22:40] Do you know
[22:41] I was confused about
one thing for a while?
[22:45] I had never met a girl
who ignored me,
[22:48] this Rania was the first,
[22:52] but now she’s good too.
[22:55] She’s impressed with me.
[22:58] Today, just for me,
[23:00] she cleaned my whole room
and even changed the setting.
[23:04] Right now?
[23:05] She went to make the tea,
without sugar.
[23:11] Okay, I’ll talk to you later.
[23:13] Bye.
[23:21] Why am I happy that
she is giving me attention?
[23:28] What happened to me?
[23:30] Tea.
[23:34] Thank you.
[23:44] Without sugar?
[23:48] I’ll have it.
[23:54] She brought me tea,
[24:00] smiled when she looked at me,
[24:02] why do I feel so good?
[24:04] It looks like Mr. Mahir,
[24:07] you’re getting out of your mind.
[24:14] Son if Mahir were home,
I would have never bothered you.
[24:21] There is nothing like that grandmother,
it’s his responsibility as well
[24:24] he is our future son-in-law.
[24:26] And anyway,
[24:27] the tradition of giving son-in-laws
an unreasonable amount of respect,
[24:29] does not exist anymore.
[24:31] Was it an appreciation
or an insult?
[24:33] Yes, yes, grandmother,
Rania is absolutely right.
[24:37] Actually Rania was the one to break
that tradition, just about now.
[24:42] Yes of course, and I’ll break more
traditions like this on my way.
[24:47] Rania my child, do one thing,
[24:50] call Mahir and tell him.
[24:53] That grandmother is only going to
the hospital for a routine checkup,
[24:57] there is nothing to worry about,
pick us up on the way back.
[25:03] What are you saying, grandmother?
[25:05] You’re talking like a stranger, no, no.
[25:07] If I picked you,
I’ll drop you as well, please.
[25:12] God, thank you my child,
thank you.
[25:14] Yes, yes, we’re just about to reach,
we’ll take a left and we’ll be there.
[25:19] We’re there already?
Yes, yes.
[26:17] Seema,
[26:21] you’ve fixed Mona’s relationship
without asking brother or Mona,
[26:25] when they’re also looking
for a boy for Mona.
[26:28] Now if they reject,
we’ll have no respect here.
[26:33] Hammad, as if you already
have so much respect?
[26:36] Whatever I did, is really good.
[26:39] I want my sister to live to the fullest,
with all her heart.
[26:43] Do you understand?
[26:44] Not like me, her sister, who’s deprived
of even the smallest things.
[26:47] What do you think, I don’t feel like
traveling to England on first-class flights?
[26:51] My hair to be glamorous.
[26:54] To wear high heels and
shop at the malls.
[26:57] And tremble and fall,
and the teeth fall out.
[27:00] Then get the new ones,
on in-laws’ expenses.
[27:04] “To travel in planes, get hairstyles,
wear heels”
[27:08] Be grateful to God that you found
such an obedient husband.
[27:13] The one who always stay
in front of your eyes,
[27:16] you don’t have to investigate after him.
[27:41] It was Zaman,
[27:43] how would my eyes not recognize
my own nephew?
[27:48] I think he didn’t look at me,
[27:51] if he had, he would’ve recognized.
[27:56] But what if he acted like a stranger
even after recognizing?
[28:08] Greetings, brother.
[28:10] Greetings.
[28:12] How are you brother?
[28:13] I’m good, sister, by the blessings of God.
[28:17] You tell, I called to ask your condition.
[28:21] I’m good too.
[28:22] Your voice doesn’t sound
like you’re alright.
[28:25] I can’t hear the thunder in your voice.
[28:29] Ammar, I saw Zaman today,
[28:34] after so many years.
[28:36] Just think of it as a reflection
for a moment.
[28:39] He just sat in a car and went away.
[28:44] He didn’t see me.
[28:45] Even if he had,
[28:47] we would’ve passed you like a stranger,
he wouldn’t have stopped.
[28:50] Just like how he left his wife, children,
and us, a while ago.
[28:55] Do you miss him?
[28:56] Sister, I called to ask about you,
[29:00] how are you?
And how is Rania?
[29:05] Your Rania is the life of our house,
[29:08] it feels like she’s been here forever.
[29:14] Okay listen,
Dabeer is returning from America,
[29:17] you all have to be here,
the whole family.
[29:21] All of you have to come
[29:25] and stay here to attend 2-4 events as well.
[29:28] But you have to visit, don’t forget.
[29:49] Father,
[29:52] father, I think my in-laws won’t respect me
as much as they should respect a son-in-law.
[29:58] How do you think about this?
[30:00] My son, I think the amount of respect
they give you is more than enough,
[30:04] they shouldn’t even be
respecting that much.
[30:06] Do you remember what you did
or you forgot?
[30:08] I don’t understand what kind of father’s
support their children.
[30:11] The ones whose children do things
that are worth supporting.
[30:15] Remember what you did,
[30:18] you disrespected
their beautiful daughter.
[30:21] Broke off the engagement
in front of everyone.
[30:24] But they proved,
they’re respected people.
[30:27] We lost respect because of you.
[30:30] Father I don’t get it
how do I make you understand?
[30:33] Shut up and sit quietly.
[30:35] Don’t ruin my tea.
[30:38] Tea only tastes better when slurp it,
[30:42] better to drink poison than drink tea
with etiquette like rich.
[30:48] But father,
I’ve made a decision
[30:50] that I’ll stay in attitude
with my in-laws.
[30:53] Because I just read somewhere
[30:55] that when people do not
respect themselves,
[30:57] nobody respects them.
[31:00] So now I’m done with disrespect,
[31:02] now it’s time to get respect.
[31:05] Hey,
[31:06] go and feed my pet chickens.
[31:10] Mr. respectable,
[31:12] if you really want to care
about something?
[31:15] Go take care of your beard.
[31:17] Looking at it reminds me
of a broomstick
[31:20] that has been disassembled
by a little kid.
[31:24] Do something about them
[31:26] or it’ll just remove its existence.
[31:29] You look stupid since you rejected
Rabail on the engagement.
[31:35] If you weren’t my son,
[31:37] I wouldn’t let you marry
your whole life.
[31:46] Yes my child Rania,
how are you?
[31:51] All of this chaos was spread by Rania.
[31:54] If she wouldn’t have forced me
to say no to Rabail,
[31:56] father wouldn’t be angry at me.
[31:58] But now just wait and watch Rania.
[32:01] I’m coming back, as a son-in-law,
[32:04] you all will regret it.
[32:12] Here you go, grandmother.
[32:14] Oh, my Dabeer is returning
after so many years.
[32:17] I am so happy I cannot even tell you.
[32:21] Do one thing my child set his room
under your supervision.
[32:26] Okay grandmother, don’t worry
I’ll manage everything.
[32:30] Please.
[32:32] Walk fast, you guys become a tortoise.
[32:34] Don’t you want to go?
[32:36] Mother we are going on an outing,
we return late, don’t worry.
[32:41] Okay, go, go.
But how will you go?
[32:43] Salik took the car.
[32:44] Okay then, plan canceled,
let’s go, let’s go.
[32:46] Hammad, listen to me,
[32:49] today, even if we have to go on a
donkey cart we’ll go for an outing.
[32:52] Do you understand?
Don’t even try to go back to our room.
[32:55] We’ll go on a bike.
[32:56] What are you doing, if 4 of us sit on
the same bike it’ll pass away.
[33:01] Haven’t you seen 7 people on a bike
in the city, we are only 4.
[33:05] Today I think our bike will be sacrificed
for my wife’s plan.
[33:11] Lazy, go take your children.
[33:14] And Seema, make him
travel the whole city.
[33:17] Okay, okay, mother.
Come on, come on.
[33:20] Go, go my children, enjoy.
[33:23] Thank you mother.
[33:35] Mother promised.
[33:39] God, I’m dead.
[33:40] Hammad.
[33:42] What are you doing?
You’re scaring us.
[33:45] Wake up and let’s go.
[33:48] Mother, where do I sit?
Sit on this tank.
[33:53] Oh God.
[33:55] Mother, I have to sit as well,
where do I sit?
[33:58] Scoot a little more,
Tipu also has to sit.
[34:01] Where do I go?
Sit on the handle?
[34:03] Adjust him in the middle here.
[34:05] Where do I adjust him
I am about to fall.
[34:07] Scoot a little forward, father.
[34:08] Do one thing, add another chair
at the back.
[34:11] We’re not going anywhere,
you’ve started a drama.
[34:12] Come on.
What do you mean?
[34:14] It took me an hour to get ready,
we are going.
[34:16] Let’s go.
[34:17] Okay then you tell me how can we adjust
four people on this motorcycle. Tell.
[34:24] None of my concern,
we are going.
[34:26] Okay then the 3 of us will stay here,
[34:28] you can go alone on the motorcycle.
[34:32] Why do you always say illogical things,
you always ruin the mood.
[34:34] Wait a second, wait a second,
what happened, why are you fighting?
[34:36] Mahir, look at this, I always
have to kill my ambitions.
[34:41] We were happy, we were going
on an outing but no, I am unfortunate.
[34:45] What happened?
[34:46] We can’t fit on the bike.
[34:49] Okay then do this,
[34:53] leave the children here,
you both can go.
[34:55] Brother Mahir, we also want to go.
[34:57] I’m here, I’ll take you both,
come on, come on.
[35:01] Let your parents go,
come on.
[35:04] Really? Thank you,
see our problem is solved.
[35:07] Come on, get off.
[35:09] Husband, do you have
any other excuse?
[35:11] I was getting spared
you trapped me again.
[35:14] Okay, bye.
Say bye to your parents.
[35:16] Bye.
Bye.
[35:18] Bye.
[35:23] Brother Mahir,
there is no car at the home,
[35:26] how will we go?
[35:28] Why are you getting worried?
Brother Mahir is here.
[35:32] I’ll take you, we’ll call a cab,
but there is one condition.
[35:37] Sister Rania?
Tell her to come with us.
[35:41] To look after you,
you’re so difficult.
[35:44] We’ll only go if she’s coming with us.
[35:46] Yes, brother Mahir, it’ll be
more fun if she comes with us.
[35:50] Really Mano? It’ll be fun with her,
[35:53] not with brother?
[35:56] Listen, go inside,
and call her.
[35:58] How is that a difficult task,
I’ll get her.
[36:01] Wait, wait, wait.
Don’t tell her that I called her.
[36:05] You’re calling her
because you both insisted.
[36:08] Obviously, she won’t come if you call her.
[36:11] She doesn’t take you seriously.
[36:13] Don’t say nonsense, do what is told.
[36:15] He’s getting really annoying.
[36:21] Brother Mahir,
do you like her just like us?
[36:24] What? Rania?
[36:26] Why would I like her?
She’s a witch.
[36:30] I’m only taking her
so she could look after you.
[36:34] Well I don’t understand
[36:36] how do you all enjoy her company,
she is so boring.
[36:42] Today will be so much fun.
[36:47] Tipu said you called me?
[36:49] What? I called you? Tipu.
[36:52] He’s lying,
[36:55] the children were insisting
that we’re going out
[36:57] so we should take sister Rania as well,
I said okay, why not.
[37:00] Really?
[37:01] I also have to shop
for uncle Dabeer’s room,
[37:05] so I’ll shop as well.
[37:06] Also, should I change or it’s okay?
[37:08] Change if you want to,
don’t if you don’t want,
[37:11] why does it matter?
