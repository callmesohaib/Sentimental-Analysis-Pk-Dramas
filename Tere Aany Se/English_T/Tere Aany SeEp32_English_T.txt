[00:18] Here there is an allegation for theft,
there father is upset.
[00:24] Not father, in fact, rich,
wealthy, educated papa.
[00:30] Call him daddy. Call him papa.
Call him papa love.
[00:33] Now calling him father is not reasonable.
[00:35] It doesn’t suit his personality.
[00:38] He is a rich man.
[00:42] Rich. Man, I am dead.
[00:45] Was that girl any less than any firework?
[00:48] Now his papa entered the picture,
that too rich papa.
[00:51] Now she will turn out to be a missile.
[00:53] Hey, listen to me first.
[00:56] Hold. Hold. Sister in law.
Sister in law. Sister in law.
[00:58] All hell broke loose at your home.
[01:01] An action film is taking place,
just the after shock is left.
[01:04] Khaver, have you lost your mind?
What nonsense is this?
[01:06] Who are you talking to?
Let me talk to them.
[01:08] Hey, leave who I am talking to.
[01:09] That Rania’s father somehow came
to life and he is rich and wealthy as well.
[01:15] What? What are you saying?
[01:17] Sister in law, I am right,
I have a great spy that lives in that home
[01:21] and look at aunt Sweetie,
[01:22] she put an allegation of dollar
theft on a rich man’s daughter,
[01:25] meaning Rania and
she dragged her out of the home.
[01:28] Dollar theft? Rich father?
[01:31] Rich father’s daughter, Rania.
[01:34] What else? Tell me the rest of the story.
[01:43] I swear to God brother Zaman,
[01:47] usually everyone in our
home used to love Rania,
[01:50] but I have loved her like a mother.
[01:52] Yes. I have failed all of
sister in law Sweetie’s moves.
[01:56] I stood in front of Rania like a shield.
[02:00] Stop it, it is enough. Stop. Stop.
[02:02] No, no, uncle, aunt is absolutely right.
[02:06] in fact, I am thankful to all of you.
[02:10] You people have really
supported me in my tough times.
[02:13] Brother, I always stand with
what is right and true.
[02:17] By the way, you didn’t tell us,
why did you leave your second wife?
[02:20] Hey.
[02:22] No, I was just asking.
[02:25] If you don’t want to tell me,
then there is no need.
[02:26] Leave it now.
[02:27] Shall we go Mahir. Shall we go home?
[02:30] Do you too have a superstore in America?
[02:35] No. No. Nothing like that.
[02:38] Fine.
[02:40] Come on Mahir, order a taxi, we will go.
[02:42] Hey, what are you saying? I will drop you.
[02:46] Thank you very much.
[02:49] Hamad bring the bike home.
[02:52] I will bring Tipu with mama.
[02:54] I will go and check where Tipu is.
He is really mischievous.
[02:58] This way I will get to see the home.
[03:03] Come on, let’s go.
Grandma.
[03:06] Grandma, you go home.
[03:08] I wont come.
[03:10] Why wont you come? It is your own home.
[03:13] You are afraid of Sweetie. Let her play.
[03:16] Please grandma, don’t insist.
[03:18] I am already really angry
because of what Mrs. Dabeer has done
[03:23] and if I go, then I wont care about that
Mrs. Dabeer, and nor will I be diplomatic.
[03:28] I will say something wrong for no reason,
then dad will have a long face.
[03:32] So it would be better grandma
that I don’t go to that home.
[03:37] Rania,
[03:40] I will come to meet you.
[03:42] You take care of yourself.
[03:46] Where did this rich father of Rania come from?
[03:48] God, I am really confused.
[03:51] Wherever he came from, sister, leave it.
[03:53] Our mission was to have her sent out
of the home, so we did. End of story.
[03:56] That is fine, but I find her rich father
coming in as some sort of drama.
[04:01] If she was the daughter of such a rich father,
[04:03] then why would she be looking for a job?
[04:05] She would have called her father once,
her father would have showered her with money.
[04:11] There is something wrong,
that I don’t understand.
[04:14] Her father coming in suddenly
hasn’t put my revenge to rest.
[04:19] Look, madam Sweetie,
listen to me really carefully. Okay?
[04:23] I am really worried for you.
[04:25] The haste you have shown putting this allegation
of theft, these people will not tolerate it.
[04:32] And I feel that Rania’s father
will also take revenge from you.
[04:36] I feel that your bad days in Pakistan have started.
[04:40] Before they do something,
[04:42] I would suggest that you slowly pack
your bags and get ready to leave.
[04:46] I will help you pack. Come on.
[04:48] Listen, don’t do this overacting
of sympathy in front of me.
[04:53] My name is Sweetie,
but I am really stubborn and bitter.
[04:57] I have decided to be stubborn till
the time I don’t get this home in my name.
[05:04] and that Mahir who has become
a supporter of that Rania,
[05:07] he too will be mine.
I will get my Honey married to that Mahir.
[05:10] Oh sister so this is your plan?
[05:16] Look sister, make me your disciple,
you wont find a better follower than me.
[05:22] No, the evil is my follower.
[05:24] My aunt’s son comes to me.
[05:27] No one can do this work better than me,
think about it.
[05:31] Hey, I told you my entire plan.
[05:36] Hear me clearly,
[05:39] if you tell anyone my plan,
[05:41] I will call the American embassy
[05:45] and I will file a harassment case on you
and then you will go to jail. Understand?
[05:50] Understand?
[05:51] I wont tell anyone.
[05:54] Hmmm.
[06:07] Greetings.
[06:07] Greetings.
[06:08] Okay listen, get me a cup of coffee.
[06:10] This 48 hour job takes a person’s life.
[06:13] I am really tired.
[06:14] In fact, bring me my coffee in my room.
I will just bring it.
[06:46] Greetings.
[06:48] Rania, you? When did you come?
[06:51] Hey, after all,
[06:53] she is my daughter,
[06:54] so obviously she will come
to live with her father.
[07:01] Why? Why are you so surprised?
Are you not happy?
[07:05] No papa,
[07:07] I am really happy to see him here.
[07:10] Think that all my tiredness is gone.
I have become fresh.
[07:15] I mean, that,
[07:17] you too were worried cause of her,
[07:20] now everything will be normal.
[07:21] Yes.
[07:23] What do you say, Rania?
[07:26] Okay, then you go and change,
then we will all sit and eat together.
[07:32] I am not hungry.
[07:33] Why? What happened to you?
[07:36] Papa, leave all this.
[07:38] we will celebrate this.
[07:42] Lets go to a good restaurant,
we will have dinner there
[07:45] and we will celebrate this happiness there.
What do you say?
[07:48] I like it. It is a great idea.
[07:51] I don’t want to go anywhere.
[07:53] Rania, please.
[07:57] I am asking you.
[07:59] after all, I have listened to you so much,
I have changed myself because you asked me.
[08:05] I have started to laugh,
[08:07] I have started to talk to people,
[08:10] Wont you agree to something
so small from me? Please.
[08:13] If you have changed thinking that
you will make deals with me, then please,
[08:19] you become like you were earlier, damned.
[08:22] I don’t care.
[08:25] After all,
[08:27] I didn’t come here because of any
reason that should be celebrated.
[08:52] Fate is on a mission to make you meet me.
[08:56] First my hospital, now my home,
[08:59] and you will see that you will enter my life too.
[09:02] And I am waiting for that moment desperately.
[09:15] I am surprised to hear about your brother.
[09:17] I mean, he made a filmy entry.
[09:20] If this happens in dramas,
people ask a hundred questions.
[09:23] But your brother has created a real
scene in real life. Real scene part.
[09:30] You are still not aware of the real scene,
that is going to happen soon.
[09:35] There is still something left to happen.
[09:37] I am unable to digest that you are
a really rich man’s only sister.
[09:41] Not accepting the reality only ruins a
person’s memory, it achieves nothing else.
[09:46] Now what it is, it is.
[09:47] And we will shift to the city really soon.
[09:52] To your brother’s big home, right?
[09:54] Obviously.
[09:56] Okay, Mian Jee is calling me,
[09:59] I will talk to you later, or maybe we will meet.
[10:05] Goodbye.
[10:09] I feel there is no line of marriage in my fate.
[10:13] First I met a girl, then she became really rich,
[10:17] and now the girl’s brother, what do I do?
[10:20] What do I do?
[10:22] Rania.
[10:24] Rania will fix everything. Rania.
[10:44] Ahem.
[10:47] What new continent are
you planning on discovering?
[10:53] Right now I am trying to discover myself.
[10:58] I don’t understand what my real identity is.
[11:04] The one that I was told
[11:08] or the one that was hidden from me.
[11:12] Rania, you are really smart.
[11:17] Just understand this,
[11:19] that at times a lot of truths need
to be hidden cause of the situation.
[11:28] The lies that I was told to hide this truth,
[11:33] it was not good.
[11:37] Papa, loves you in fact all of you a lot.
[11:45] If this was really true,
[11:48] then you wouldn’t have had to bear witness
to this standing in front of his daughter.
[11:52] Rania, even if you consider me a stranger,
but you can ask papa.
[11:58] I don’t just call him papa,
but consider him papa too.
[12:02] He is not just my late parents’ friend,
but also my family too now.
[12:07] So please, you consider this home yours
and live here with all your right.
[12:13] I didn’t come here for any right…
[12:19] I didn’t come here to show my right,
[12:22] in fact, I have been brought here out of helplessness.
[12:37] I will buy a home my daughter likes for her.
[12:42] You tell me,
[12:44] when will you come to see a home with me?
[12:48] Whatever you have done for me is enough.
[12:55] There is no need to buy any home.
[12:58] I too have your blood in my veins.
[13:01] Who knows when I will leave
everything and run away?
[13:18] Papa.
[13:19] Papa, everything will be fine.
[13:23] Why do you worry?
[13:25] I know Rania well,
[13:29] she cannot stay upset with anyone for long.
[13:31] Please.
[13:52] I am really surprised in this age,
and such pretty hair.
[13:57] What do you mean in this age?
What is my age?
[14:00] There in America everyone
considers me unmarried.
[14:03] They must all be blind.
[14:05] Absolutely. Absolutely.
[14:07] In fact, I would say that you look so pretty,
[14:13] when I get married,
you style your hair just like this.
[14:17] You will look equally pretty.
[14:19] All my friends will be there
in my marriage, and you?
[14:23] You are the life of this family, respect,
pride, and God knows what all you are.
[14:29] And sister Seema, she is nothing
in front of you, she is just plain.
[14:34] Oh, I am dead.
[14:36] What did you do with her hair?
[14:38] I think there was a blind eagle and the poor thing
had an epilepsy attack while making her nest.
[14:43] Stop. Stop. Leave it.
[14:47] I know well that you are jealous of
sister in law Sweetie’s love and beauty.
[14:53] And I know well, that you don’t like the love
between me and sister in law, Sweetie.
[14:59] Not just your love, I don’t like you at all.
[15:03] You look poisonous.
I don’t feel like calling you my sister.
[15:06] Hey, you are like a nail.
[15:08] Show-off, uptight, you still have no wealth and
look at you, how you have changed your face.
[15:14] What does this mean?
[15:15] Wealth hasn’t come, in fact,
wealth has already come.
[15:18] Since I got engaged to Khaver darling,
precious gifts have come for me.
[15:22] And if you don’t believe it,
then go survey my room, you will find out.
[15:27] After all, smart people have said correctly,
[15:29] a person should go around with
people their own standard.
[15:33] What do you say Sweetie?
You are right.
[15:36] Seema, I don’t know
where you have gone to today.
[15:38] Go and make me tea.
I am tired.
[15:42] Listen, whatever you are getting, get two.
[15:45] And don’t add sugar in my tea,
because I am on a diet.
[15:48] Oh, your existence is like a stone.
[15:55] My whole body has been crushed.
Khaver. Khaver darling where are you?
[16:01] Please lets go. Hospital.
[16:12] I have told aunty clearly that after
I come to Pakistan, I will meet my family.
[16:17] I will go to my uncle’s home,
and then I will come to meet her.
[16:19] You did good.
[16:21] You know everyone really misses you here.
[16:26] Mahir, come here.
[16:28] Honey, I will talk to you a little later. Okay?
[16:30] My friend has come over to stay nowadays.
[16:33] He is a little upset.
[16:36] No, no worries, you give him time,
we will talk later. Bye.
[16:39] Okay, bye, bye, bye.
[16:43] What happened? Are you okay?
[16:46] Yes, I am fine, man. I just have a headache.
[16:50] You tell me, who were you talking to?
[16:52] Honey, aunt’s daughter.
[16:55] Actually aunt passed away in America a long time back,
but then her aunt adopted her.
[17:00] But she hasn’t been able to forget
anyone from her mummy’s family.
[17:03] She is coming here for a few days.
You tell me, how was your day?
[17:07] How will it be?
[17:10] The same as it passes daily.
[17:36] With you coming to this home
has brought life to this home.
[17:40] Seeing you here, I feel that
dreams are turning into reality.
[17:46] What?
[17:48] You used to dream of me in this home?
[17:51] Why?
[17:54] Now I don’t have any answer for this why.
[17:58] Okay,
[18:00] if your dreams really turn into reality,
then will you dream something for me.
[18:06] Tell me,
[18:08] what do you want to see in the dream?
[18:11] You dream that Mahir is really rich,
[18:16] all his worries are over.
[18:18] And he has become a big businessman.
[18:22] You really worry for Mahir,
you always think about him.
[18:28] I will worry.
[18:30] Right now the difficulties Mahir is in,
[18:32] when you hear it,
you too will think about him all the time.
[18:35] His step mother, aunt Sweetie…
[18:37] Can we not talk about something else?
[18:42] Yes.
[18:45] You are right.
[18:47] You shouldn’t mention aunty Sweetie,
it spoils the mood.
[18:52] You tell me about yourself,
[18:54] how long do you know him…papa?
[19:03] This is something old.
[19:07] Papa and my parents used
to be really good friends.
[19:12] He was upset with his Mrs. behavior
he used to often come to our home.
[19:19] Papa used to be really worried in those days
[19:23] and he was also embarrassed.
[19:26] If I tell you honestly,
[19:28] he used to really miss all of you people.
[19:32] He used to talk about you people.
[19:36] During that time,
[19:39] my mother passed away.
[19:42] In that situation papa became
a really good friend of mine,
[19:47] he became a partner in my sorrows,
he shared my sorrow.
[19:51] That’s it, during that time,
my papa too went to my mama.
[19:58] And papa became my real papa.
[20:04] What happened?
[20:05] Why did you get quiet?
[20:06] Tell me more.
[20:10] What do I tell you?
[20:12] You didn’t tell me anything about yourself.
[20:15] Papa tells me that your
grandfather brought you up.
[20:20] Yes, my Mian Jee.
[20:22] My Mian Jee,
[20:24] brought me up with a lot of love,
attention and affection.
[20:28] He will come in a few days,
you meet him.
[20:30] You will really like it.
[20:33] Yes.
[20:34] You know, my Mian Jee has a really good heart
[20:39] and he really likes smart and respecting people.
[20:43] I am sure when you meet him,
you will become friends with him,
[20:47] the same way Mahir has become his friend.
[20:51] I pray to God that you too start liking me,
[20:53] I make a home in your heart.
[20:55] You take my name instead
of Mahir on everything.
[21:00] I pray to God this happens.
[21:03] You really miss Mahir?
[21:09] I don’t miss him, but at times I think of him.
[21:13] He is in so much difficulty.
[21:16] And mama, Mahir’s grandma,
she is my Mian Jee’s sister.
[21:21] So this way me
and Mahir are close relatives,
[21:25] and you know, relatives have so much right.
[21:28] Just that’s why.
[21:38] This dress is for my Bebo.
[21:41] It is really pretty.
[21:43] and see, all these are for Rania.
[21:47] She will like them, right?
[21:48] Why wont she like them?
And my dress is really pretty.
[21:51] Do you like it?
[21:54] Where is yours?
[21:55] I don’t need it Bebo.
[21:58] Why don’t you need it?
[21:59] You really need it,
and now you have to take care of yourself.
[22:03] I have to take you to
Haar Singhar for a facial.
[22:06] Idiot. When there was time,
I never got a facial done, and I go right now.
[22:12] There is no time,
[22:14] and when a person is young,
they are fresh and beautiful.
[22:17] He doesn’t need these things.
So all this is for this age.
[22:22] The time you spend alone in your life,
it is time for it to end is here.
[22:26] Now you have to focus on yourself,
you have to take care of yourself.
[22:33] Bebo,
[22:36] everything seems fine on the outside.
[22:40] Everything is normal.
[22:43] But my heart doesn’t agree.
[22:48] That man,
[22:50] who kicked me out of his life,
[22:54] the one who rejected me,
[22:57] today he has come back,
[23:00] so who will account for the days of my life
that I spent without him, when I needed him?
[23:11] This thing doesn’t leave my heart.
[23:16] Sister,
[23:21] brother has made a big mistake,
[23:24] but the issue is that it took him
a long time to realize his mistake.
[23:32] But sister in law everything is good now,
[23:35] Rania too has reached her father.
[23:38] He also calls you daily.
[23:40] He is calling us all to the city.
[23:43] And have you not seen Mian Jee,
it feels he never had an ailment.
[23:50] This is really true.
[23:53] Mian Jee is really fresh,
[23:56] like he was suffering from the sorrow of his son.
[24:00] Okay, thank God,
[24:02] he made the father meet his son.
[24:06] If I tell you the truth, all this is fruit of your
patience that our family is connected again.
[24:13] Everything is good.
[24:14] Now you will see, we will make time pay for
all our present and past happiness.
[24:20] That is true.
[24:22] You know Bebo,
[24:24] what is the name of the biggest happiness?
[24:29] Uncle Ayaz.
[24:30] Sister in law, at least now you
don’t call him uncle. Poor thing.
[24:37] Okay see, how is it? It is good, right?
It is really pretty.
[24:41] This colour purple is also really pretty.
[24:55] Hey,
[24:57] what happened?
Why did you suddenly come out here?
[25:01] No, nothing, just like that.
[25:05] I understand what is in your heart,
and I admit my fault too.
[25:11] But I know admitting my mistake
I still cannot make amends for your loss.
[25:20] Child, it is not in my hands to
bring back time that has happened,
[25:27] but whatever happened with
you at aunt’s home that day,
[25:31] I cannot forget it.
[25:34] As much as I hold that woman responsible,
I consider myself equally responsible.
[25:42] This home was made by Wasiq’s father.
[25:48] Wasiq wanted to go abroad for his specialization,
[25:52] he wanted to sell this home.
[25:56] So I decided to buy this home.
[25:59] But now I have decided that
I will put this home in your name.
[26:05] In my name? Why?
[26:09] There is no need for that.
[26:12] I know Mian Jee didn’t bring you up like that.
[26:17] You are not interested in wealth or money,
[26:21] but what can we do child,
[26:24] this society runs on its own rules.
[26:28] The one who has property and
money is the one who gets respected.
[26:32] I have spoken to Wasiq.
[26:35] He is not ready to give me
this home by taking a payment.
[26:39] But we will pay the complete price for it.
[26:43] I am calling the lawyer for this tomorrow.
[26:47] Please don’t buy it on my name.
[26:50] Why? It will be in your name tomorrow.
[26:54] After I die, it will all be in your name,
then why not today?
[27:00] I will call the lawyer tomorrow, be ready.
[27:04] Rania, child,
[27:06] I have wasted a lot of my life,
[27:09] now maybe I have little time.
[27:12] Now if you don’t forgive this sinner father,
[27:15] then I too don’t want this life.
[27:24] Papa.
[27:32] I forgive you.
[27:53] Asma. Asma, tell me the date when you
are coming to Lahore, then you see my haste.
[27:58] Imagine if you come today,
then I will bring my heart tomorrow.
[28:02] I mean, tomorrow,
I will come with a proposal for you at your home.
[28:06] Have you spoken to sister?
She will agree, right?
[28:10] I will talk to sister?
[28:12] Whatever I say is the rule of this home. Okay?
[28:14] I take the decisions of this home.
[28:16] What I say happens.
[28:18] Without my will , nothing can be moved
in this home. It moved. It moved.
[28:22] One minute, wait. Sister will kill me.
[28:27] Yes, so you do one thing,
don’t worry, you just wait.
[28:33] It is possible I come with a ring,
[28:36] and it is also possible I bring a molvi,
I might surprise you.
[28:40] No. No. No need to be so hasty.
[28:44] First you pray that my family agrees as well.
[28:48] Because only what Mian Jee
says happens in our home.
[28:51] What he says, he says.
[28:53] What are you saying Asma?
[28:55] You had said everything is fine,
Mian Jee will agree.
[28:57] Everyone at home is happy.
What sort of news are you giving me, Asma?
[29:00] This is like saying no, in a way.
[29:03] This means, if you look at it,
I don’t have marriage in my fate.
[29:07] I am even dreaming of wedding choirs.
[29:10] I had also chosen my wedding dress.
[29:12] Asma, you say this is a lie.
You are lying, right? You are lying, right, Asma?
[29:17] What is wrong?
I have only expressed one fear.
[29:21] You know another interviewer
has been added to the list, brother.
[29:27] So it is possible he will ask a difficult question,
so you prepare and come.
[29:32] Okay? Goodbye.
[29:38] Hey, how do I prepare?
Should I get my knives sharpened?
[29:41] What do I do that her stubborn father
and rich brother agree.
[29:46] What do I do? God what do I do?
[29:49] Hey unfaithful girl, your madness.
[29:54] Stop it. Stop it. Stop singing this song. Quiet.
[29:57] What happened? Did you not like the song.
[29:59] If you want, I can sing a song you like.
This is Zeeshan Ahmad’s song, by the way.
[30:03] You know, by the way, you are the sort of
people who get happiness on a platter, for free.
[30:08] How would you know the emotions of love?
If you have loved you would know.
[30:14] Oh uncle, you have made this tragic face again.
[30:17] Now you will see, you will think of something bad,
and surely something bad will happen with you.
[30:20] Child, I am already almost dead.
[30:22] Both you brother and sister scare me to death.
[30:25] Hey, the news will run on Geo,
[30:26] a single, twenty eight year old man
has been laid to rest after his funeral.
[30:30] Because his hopes have been ruined.
His hopes have been ruined.
[30:33] Uncle, what are you saying?
How do you get these bad thoughts in your head?
[30:38] Brother, what does mama say?
[30:40] An idle mind is a devil’s workshop,
so uncle is facing the same.
[30:44] I will respond to this later.
I need your help Farhad.
[30:48] Ask Rania to ask her father that the single,
good, decent and honest man
[30:53] he is looking for his sister who is standing here,
look at him and think about him.
[30:57] Man, you talk to her, things will workout,
something will happen.
[31:00] Why does everyone make
me praise them falsely?
[31:04] Look, you are making me put in a
good word even before the entrance.
[31:06] I don’t know what his father
will ask me in the interview.
[31:09] Will there be MCQs or not?
[31:12] Don’t worry, I am telling you,
everything will be fine.
[31:16] hey they wont ask you for the formula of making
an atom bomb, or how to take off a plane.
[31:23] They wont ask you for such a technique.
[31:25] You don’t worry, everything will be fine.
[31:26] Really?
[31:27] But you promise you will talk
to Rania about me, right?
[31:33] Fine, okay.
[31:34] I will ask Rabail to go to Rania
and talk to her. That’s it?
[31:39] Yes. I don’t know what will happen.
[31:41] Whether I will survive the interview or not.
[31:49] Congratulations child,
this home is yours from today.
[31:53] Congratulations Rania,
[31:55] this home is really yours.
[31:57] But I didn’t want all this.
[32:01] But this is what fate wants.
[32:06] Take it.
[32:13] Thank you, papa.
[32:14] Hey, what is there to thank me in this?
[32:18] Mr. Mahir has come outside.
[32:20] Mahir is here?
[32:21] So why have you made him
stand outside? Bring him inside.
[32:23] He is no stranger.
He is my mama’s real grandson. Call him.
[32:27] I will just call him.
[32:34] Mahir, how are you?
[32:36] Fine.
[32:38] How is this possible?
[32:40] Someone who orders his pawns around
is away from them and he is happy too?
[32:44] You are hiding something from me, right?
Fine, don’t tell me, I wont ask you either.
[32:50] Greetings uncle.
[32:51] Greetings.
[32:52] How are you uncle? Are you fine?
[32:53] Greetings.
Greetings.
[32:55] Have a seat.
Sure.
[32:59] Rania, get tea made, in fact also order sweets.
[33:03] Sweets?
[33:05] What for uncle?
[33:06] I will tell you.
[33:08] first you tell me about yourself.
[33:11] Uncle,
[33:14] I have decided to start my business.
[33:16] Okay.
[33:17] The investment is a little low,
[33:19] but if I can get your guidance,
it would be better.
[33:22] So what? Papa will give you a loan.
[33:26] No. No. I don’t need a loan uncle,
I just needed your advice.
[33:31] Look, first, don’t hesitate when talking to me.
[33:37] After all, I am your uncle, not a stranger,
[33:40] and Rania is right.
[33:44] Your own help you.
[33:47] I will surely help you.
[33:51] By the way, you tell him your good news.
[33:53] Yes, Mahir,
[33:56] papa has bought this home from
Dr. Wasiq and put it in my name.
[33:59] I told him not to,
[34:01] but papa made everyone from mama
to Mian Jee put in a good word.
[34:05] Bought it?
[34:07] What do you mean?
[34:08] He is your son.
[34:12] You too thought the same just like me.
[34:14] Earlier I too thought that
Dr. Wasiq is papa’s son.
[34:18] Meaning, he is not your brother?
[34:19] Hey, no, no, there is nothing like that.
Not at all.
[34:24] Papa is my father’s friend,
but now he is my papa.
[34:35] I will get sweets.
[34:43] Mahir, all good?
