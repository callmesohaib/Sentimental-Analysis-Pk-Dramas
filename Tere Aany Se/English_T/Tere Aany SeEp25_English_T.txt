[00:17] Did you guys see,
[00:19] how she was emphasizing every word,
[00:22] that I call father,
whenever I want money.
[00:25] Who is she to say anything,
[00:27] I will ask for money whenever I want,
I have a right to that.
[00:31] Oh don't be angry, don't get mad,
she's an unkind woman.
[00:35] She doesn't even respect our mother.
[00:38] I am getting restless looking at her.
[00:40] I don't know when will she return,
[00:41] if I could I would go away from
this house for a while.
[00:44] Why would you go? Why would
any of us go anywhere?
[00:48] This house belongs to all of us,
if someone has to go, it's her.
[00:51] But she said this is her house.
[00:54] She won't get the ownership of this house
just by saying that it's hers.
[00:57] I got this house built
by my own hands,
[01:01] this is my house,
I mean this is our house.
[01:04] I have decided that
I am going back tomorrow.
[01:09] Bebo why would you go back?
[01:10] You came recently. Rania,
please convince her.
[01:14] She is wiser than me,
[01:16] she knows a person is responsible
for their own dignity.
[01:19] Oh, it looks like a meeting is in process,
[01:22] some important decisions are being made.
[01:24] Was I wrong to come here?
[01:25] No, no, come on have a seat.
[01:29] And why did you get up so soon?
[01:31] You must be tired after a long flight,
you should rest.
[01:35] The ones who have so many
responsibilities on their shoulder
[01:38] can only think about taking rest,
[01:40] cannot actually take rest.
[01:43] Pakistani people only assume
that dollars grow on trees,
[01:47] that's not true,
[01:48] we have to work really
to earn in dollars.
[01:51] And when those hard-earned
dollars are wasted,
[01:55] it really saddens.
[01:57] Just like how I'm sad.
[01:59] Why are you sad about giving
people their rightful money?
[02:02] It's a long story
[02:04] but wait for it your question
will be answered.
[02:08] Tea?
[02:09] Do you want tea?
I make really good tea.
[02:12] Yes,
[02:13] even the tea would be prepared
in a bucket here,
[02:16] I would like to try some.
[02:18] You will really like it, Seema special milk
and tea, extra jaggery.
[02:25] Rabail, I'm going to my friend's,
[02:28] inform grandmother.
[02:30] Listen,
[02:31] leave the car keys inside,
I have to go somewhere.
[02:39] He is showing attitude as if
it’s his father's car.
[02:59] Hey my luck, my luck.
[03:03] So in this moment of joy why not
we go to some five-star restaurant?
[03:11] Me too, me too.
[03:12] No problem at all,
[03:13] I can take your whole crew with you
if you ask me to,
[03:16] I have a lot of money.
[03:18] Oh no, no.
[03:19] I mean what would
these poor people do,
[03:24] going to a restaurant, they already
have problems of their own.
[03:28] Brother Dabeer's wife
has returned from America,
[03:31] she's been
[03:35] Really?
She also scolded brother Mahir.
[03:37] Yes, she annoyed him the most.
[03:41] Wow, live long, live long,
[03:43] just know that I'll come to your house
very soon to see his live insult.
[03:48] Dabeer, when I told that mannerless
son of yours to leave the keys here
[03:54] then why did he take the car?
[03:56] Sweetie, don't get angry
without any reason,
[03:59] I'll talk to him when he'll return.
[04:01] What are you going to tell him?
[04:03] You need to explain this stray cat,
[04:06] it's Mahir's car why would
he leave the car at home?
[04:09] He didn't go for some aimless wandering,
[04:12] he went for some work,
explain this to her,
[04:15] she's been ringing like a whistle all day.
[04:17] Dabeer, tell your mother to not
meddle in my matters,
[04:22] you could be jailed for talking like this
if it were America.
[04:25] Hey, listen to me,
this is not your America,
[04:28] this is our Pakistan. I'll speak,
I will definitely speak,
[04:32] tell her, if she won't understand
then take her to a hotel.
[04:39] What?
[04:41] Dabeer, listen to
what your mother is saying,
[04:45] she is telling me to shift to a hotel.
[04:47] Why would I shift to a hotel,
I would shift you all to a road.
[04:52] I'm dead.
[04:53] Sweetie, let's go to our room
for a few minutes,
[04:58] we'll talk there, come,
let's go to the room.
[05:01] Okay, we'll talk in the room,
[05:04] because if I say anything here,
[05:07] your family won't be able
to bear your insult.
[05:10] Come, come to the room,
come to the room with me.
[05:14] What happened?
[05:16] What happened grandmother?
[05:17] I can't breathe.
[05:18] Oh grandmother,
grandmother is not well.
[05:20] I think we should take her
to the hospital,
[05:23] I will call brother Dabeer
and brother Hammad.
[05:25] No, it will only spread the stress,
[05:26] do one thing, go to the neighbors
and tell Farhad to get the car.
[05:29] Okay.
Grandmother,
try to breathe,
[05:30] I will get water for you,
wait, wait, wait.
[05:42] Why did you bring me to a hospital,
I'm quite alright, I am telling you
[05:46] I just got mad so blood pressure
must've raised, nothing else.
[05:50] Grandmother, you should focus
on your health
[05:52] and let that Sweetie be on her own,
don't listen to her.
[05:56] I am telling you,
I won't get admitted here,
[05:59] that's why don't come to the hospital
I get suffocated,
[06:04] please take me home.
[06:06] Okay but see the doctor first he will
prescribe a medicine or two, that's it.
[06:09] Or wait, I'll get you a wheelchair.
[06:11] There is no need for that,
I can walk,
[06:14] nothing happened to me,
[06:15] I am not as weak as that
foreign woman thinks of me.
[06:19] Yes grandmother, but relax first
and get the receipt.
[06:21] Yes.
Sorry, sorry,
[06:23] we left the file in the car, I'll go get it.
[06:25] No, no, Farhad, take her to get
the receipt, give me the keys.
[06:29] Sure?
Yes, yes.
[06:31] Thank you, thank you, thank you,
here you go, here's the keys.
[06:33] Come on grandmother, come.
[07:04] Asma.
[07:06] Asma, my sister.
[07:16] But what are you doing here?
[07:21] Is everything alright?
[07:26] Asma,
[07:27] Asma please, my sister.
[07:31] Don't look away,
[07:34] I'm really ashamed.
[07:37] Want to apologize for what I did.
[07:40] The time for apologizing and forgiveness
has long gone, brother.
[07:43] You were occupied in your own world
and we learned to live without you.
[07:47] Just wait for a little more, Dr. Wasiq
would be here any moment,
[07:50] we will go once we see him and
I won't take any of your excuses.
[07:56] Where is Bebo, I'll go see her,
[07:59] you stay here, don't move, I'll be back.
Okay.
[08:21] How are you?
I'm alright.
[08:24] I,
[08:25] I'm really ashamed of my behavior that day,
[08:30] actually I couldn't understand your emotions.
[08:33] It's okay,
[08:36] maybe I overreacted.
[08:38] No, no, you didn't do anything,
[08:41] actually I was trapped in my own mind
[08:46] that's why I couldn't understand your feelings.
[08:50] You,
[08:51] you should come to visit me,
tell me your story,
[08:55] you lost your father
[08:59] and I lost everything.
[09:08] Oh, leave me, I'm alright.
Calmly.
[09:13] I am not as weak to not even compete
with that American pest.
[09:18] Really, you're alright, right?
[09:21] What happened maximum?
[09:23] You forgot to take the medicine for 2 days
in the joy of the arrival of your daughter-in-law.
[09:26] The doctor is crazy to prescribe
all those medicines.
[09:29] I am telling you,
[09:30] I am taking all the medicines on time
[09:33] because I need to fight that
stray cat and win.
[09:37] Very good,
[09:39] we're with you in this mission.
[09:40] We won't sit back till you win,
right Bebo.
[09:46] Bebo? Bebo.
[09:48] Did you hear what
grandmother had to say?
[09:51] She is the one behind all this.
[09:53] I'll go get the medicines, okay?
Yes.
[09:57] Rania my child, call Mahir
[10:00] and ask if he has reached
home or not.
[10:02] Since this witch arrived he does
not find peace at home.
[10:06] He will reach home, he is not a child
[10:10] and he is not even as naive as you think.
[10:13] He knows how to fight very well.
[10:37] Rania,
[10:39] what is your problem?
[10:41] You are the one with the problem
[10:43] that you are entering someone's room
without knocking on the door.
[10:45] Go back outside and take permission first.
[10:48] Did you ask permission
before entering our lives?
[10:50] Grandmother was unwell
[10:52] and you didn't even call me
to inform,
[10:54] you know how close I am with her,
how much I love her.
[10:57] There are already so many
problems in this house
[11:00] so I thought everyone would
panic even more.
[11:03] Well, grandmother is absolutely fine,
you can go meet her if you want.
[11:07] And yes,
[11:08] only express anger on the ones
you're angry at,
[11:10] I'm not here to tolerate
everyone's tantrums.
[11:27] Hey mother,
you went to the hospital alone,
[11:30] you didn't tell anyone.
[11:31] What were you going to do,
are you a doctor?
[11:33] Mother you make us laugh I swear.
[11:36] You should have taken along someone.
[11:39] I didn't go all alone,
he went with me, Farhad.
[11:43] And with me was Rania,
everyone at the hospital knows Rania,
[11:48] everyone left their work
and catered to us.
[11:52] Okay then eat this as well.
Okay.
[11:54] Well that's true, Rania knows
how to win the hearts.
[11:59] Yes.
[12:01] Mother, leave all this,
tell me are you alright?
[12:05] Yes I am absolutely alright,
[12:07] just looking at that stray cat
makes my blood boil.
[12:13] It's ancestral blood,
it boils fast.
[12:17] Tell me one thing you told us that,
your wife's leg fractured,
[12:23] did you lie to us?
Now you will see,
[12:25] I'll send her back with the fractured leg.
[12:29] Thank God grandmother
you are alright,
[12:31] do you know how worried
I was for you?
[12:34] Not only alright
you are also ready to attack.
[12:37] What do you think,
your grandmother is a strong woman.
[12:42] I am not scared of American caterpillars.
[12:44] Leave her grandmother
she is already mad, stupid.
[12:48] Why would we let her go?
[12:50] Do you know all those years when
you enabled and ignored her behavior,
[12:54] that is the reason she does not
consider us anything now.
[13:00] How does she talk to
grandmother like that?
[13:01] You should be ashamed
she is older than you
[13:04] talk to her with respect.
[13:05] When did I misbehave?
[13:08] I was behaving quite alright
[13:09] and you should tell her that
I am not accustomed to this attitude,
[13:12] she shouldn't talk to me like that.
[13:15] I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.
[13:17] Why you shouldn't have come?
[13:19] I am your mother,
I yearned to see your face.
[13:24] And don't be your wife's slave,
be a man and learn to say what's true.
[13:29] Yes brother she's right.
[13:40] I made this especially for you with jaggery,
you know brown sugar.
[13:45] Thank you.
[13:48] Well sister-in-law can you see
how there is chaos at your house?
[13:53] Yes, I realized it
as soon as I reached,
[13:57] the whole family is looting
my dollars with both hands.
[14:00] 100%, apart from my family.
[14:04] Okay tell me one thing,
[14:05] why are there so many irrelevant
relatives living in this house?
[14:09] On top of that, even the neighbors
are always here,
[14:12] this is the limit.
[14:15] Well,
[14:16] now that Sweetie is here,
[14:18] she'll make everything alright.
[14:21] Sweetie sister-in-law,
[14:23] I'm with you, I'll be right beside you.
[14:27] And also I think of you
as my older sister.
[14:30] Well, I don't need anyone,
[14:34] but it's okay if you insist.
[14:38] Okay tell me, why does Dabeer's son
[14:40] always have an attitude?
Please explain to me.
[14:44] He's pampered by grandmother,
he's like that to everyone,
[14:47] he's really arrogant and ill-natured.
[14:50] He's the one in possession of
all your dollars,
[14:52] and he only shops for himself.
[14:58] Hammad, why are you clearing
your throat like this?
[15:01] I'm not saying wrong,
[15:03] anyways I don't have the habit to lie.
[15:05] There are only two people who sympathize
with you in the whole house,
[15:08] my sister Mona and I, Seema.
[15:11] Seema, come outside with me,
[15:14] I need to talk to you
about something important.
[15:16] Excuse me sister in law
we will be back.
[15:18] Go, I'm coming.
Come.
[15:23] Sister-in-law if you need anything
[15:26] snacks, juice, tea or coffee,
[15:28] just call out my name
and I will be there.
[15:44] You called me?
[15:45] That is so wrong Seema
[15:47] I can't even tell you how much
you have disappointed me.
[15:50] You have been talking ill about
the family in front of her,
[15:53] it's the same people who care
about you, who respect you.
[15:56] They arranged your sister's engagement
with so much luxury.
[15:59] And Mahir, how much
he cares about our children,
[16:02] he fulfills all their needs.
[16:05] And you were talking like
that about him.
[16:07] Take your phone and
start playing games on it
[16:11] because that's all you're capable of.
[16:13] If you don't know the matter don't try
to include yourself in it.
[16:18] I don't want to see you talking with
sister-in-law Sweetie like this again.
[16:24] I will, I know very well
where the river flows.
[16:31] Sister-in-law Sweetie is the
next big thing,
[16:34] anyone on her side will be
benefited from this.
[16:37] If you want to support the opposite group
then you do you,
[16:40] who is there to stop you?
it's good for you.
[16:41] Listen to me.
Yes, Mr. Listen to me.
[16:49] Listen Khawar,
[16:51] won't you have time for me
after marriage as well?
[16:54] You know you are my first
and last love
[16:59] I cannot even imagine
going away from you.
[17:03] What, really? It's true?
[17:06] I can't believe.
[17:07] Are you standing in front of a mirror?
[17:10] Yes.
[17:11] Then move your existence
to somewhere else,
[17:14] you might believe then.
Okay, okay.
[17:17] Mona darling,
[17:19] how long is this film going to run?
[17:20] Why do you have a problem
with such things?
[17:22] You know the stressed environment
in the house,
[17:24] and this Khawar is not running anywhere,
he'll stay.
[17:27] Listen to me,
I did not bring this tension here,
[17:30] and now don't interrupt me
in the middle of it.
[17:34] Yes darling,
[17:36] you should definitely come,
I'll wait for you.
[17:40] Here we go, she's inviting
Khawar as well,
[17:43] As if there's is a circus at this house
that everyone should watch.
[17:50] The way everyone is behaving
with me in his house,
[17:52] I'm not accustomed to it,
[17:54] I hope I won't leave the house.
[17:57] Why would you leave the house,
[17:59] if someone has to leave it
should be Sweetie.
[18:01] What that Sweetie makes noise
it hurts my ears.
[18:05] What happened, why does everyone
look so worried and sad?
[18:09] It looks like some
important plan has failed.
[18:11] You tell me,
when are you planning to return?
[18:15] I'm not planning anything like that,
[18:17] I feel quite at home at this place
[18:19] and I have been seeing a lot of things
I need to fix around the house,
[18:24] then I will think about it.
[18:26] Sweetie, you're here?
[18:30] The weather outside is very pleasant,
[18:33] I think you feel really good sitting there.
[18:36] You are telling me to go sit in the lawn,
[18:39] so all of you could sit here comfortably.
[18:41] No, no, no, no, no.
God's forgiveness,
[18:44] what are you saying Sweetie,
how could this be true?
[18:48] Coward. Wife's servant.
[18:53] Why do you all look so scared of me,
[18:56] what do you think,
[18:57] am I going to take the count
of every dollar from you?
[19:00] What, what, what, what?
[19:01] What did you say?
Tally of dollars? What dollars?
[19:04] Which dollars is she talking about?
No, no, no, no,
[19:06] Sweetie is just telling a joke.
[19:09] Yes, I have a habit of making
dangerous jokes,
[19:13] and sometimes I get serious
while joking, right Dabeer?
[19:17] You didn't tell them?
[19:19] And I never joke,
[19:22] I'm always serious,
didn't you tell her Dabeer?
[19:25] I, I'm a lone soul,
what am I going to tell?
[19:29] Both of these have
so many good qualities.
[19:33] Hello, hello, hello.
I have a good news.
[19:36] Uncle Rafique,
who is my father-in-law,
[19:38] he's coming to visit us with his family.
[19:42] Now tell us the good news.
This is the good news,
[19:44] whenever you say something
it's useless.
[19:47] This Rafique doesn't have
peace at his place,
[19:50] listen, tell Seema to arrange
dinner for them.
[19:54] Okay, bye.
[19:58] There is always a luster at this place,
[20:00] sometimes Rabail's in-laws,
sometimes Mona's in-laws,
[20:04] a lot of dollars are being spent,
right Dabeer?
[20:08] No, yes, no, yes.
[20:13] You could've refused at least.
[20:15] What happened?
What happened? Nothing.
[20:26] I realized my mistake a long ago,
[20:29] I just delayed the return.
[20:31] I went home, I begged father,
[20:35] I apologized to Aasia but
they didn't forgive me.
[20:39] Please Bebo, please,
put in the good words for me.
[20:44] Tell me how is my doll?
[20:48] You remember you also had a child?
[20:53] You're apologizing to me,
what do I forget?
[20:57] And how do I forgive,
[21:01] you are in debt of a lot of people
not just me.
[21:10] If possible,
[21:14] please think about me
and contact me.
[21:24] What happened,
why are you standing here alone?
[21:28] Nothing.
[21:30] Rani, I was just thinking,
[21:33] now I should go back,
[21:35] Brother Dabeer's wife?
Her behavior isn't right.
[21:42] It seems like
[21:44] she has assumed that we are staying here
to get free favours.
[21:52] Yes,
[21:54] I also think that I won't be able
to live here for long,
[22:00] I will have to shift to a hostel.
[22:04] Bebo, talk to grandfather,
[22:07] tell him that I'll spend
as less as possible,
[22:10] but I can't stay here anymore.
[22:14] Okay, you don't have to worry.
[23:06] Hey Sweetie,
[23:08] what are you doing here
in Mahir's room?
[23:12] This is Mahir's room?
Yes, yes.
[23:14] I thought this room belonged
to some prince.
[23:18] What's happening here?
[23:21] Your father is saying that
this is your room
[23:24] and I am saying that it seems like a
big showroom of a luxury brand.
[23:28] Wow, everything is branded.
[23:32] Have you ever asked your father?
[23:34] He spends the whole year in just
two pairs of shirts and trousers.
[23:38] What are you trying to say?
[23:41] What would I say? I am speechless.
[23:43] Are you a son of a salesman like Dabeer
[23:46] or are you the son of the owner
of a superstore like Sweetie.
[23:51] What?
[23:52] Salesman.
[23:54] Yes, your father is bragging everywhere,
[23:58] I'm the owner of that superstore,
Sweetie.
[24:01] Oh God, you people robbed me
of my money.
[24:09] Oh, Mahir, seems like you got upset.
[24:14] Dabeer would you like to shed
some light on this matter?
[24:18] Look, you shouldn't get so angry,
you'll get sick.
[24:23] I'm really angry,
[24:26] and till I take it all out on someone
I won't get better.
[24:30] Sweetie, listen to me calmly,
[24:32] guests are coming to meet you,
[24:34] you should be careful you'll get sick,
we will talk later.
[24:40] Yes, yes, Mr. Dabeer tell me,
tell me my crown,
[24:43] state what you're saying.
[24:45] Don't get angry,
don't get angry.
[24:48] Sweetie.
[24:49] Oh wait a minute dude.
[24:55] Salesman.
[24:57] For so many years,
you have been cheating on me,
[25:01] you have been deceiving me, and you’ve
been sending all my dollars here.
[25:05] No, no, no, Sweetie,
there is nothing like that,
[25:08] I never hid anything from you,
I tell you everything.
[25:12] And anyway, Mahir has
his own business here.
[25:18] Really?
[25:19] Tell me, what business does he have?
Tell me right now.
[25:25] He has a business of property.
[25:27] Really?
He deals with the properties?
[25:30] Yes.
[25:31] Father sends my dollars here and
the son buys the properties here,
[25:35] that's a business of properties.
[25:38] It is not like this Sweetie.
[25:41] Then all of these properties are
built on my money.
[25:48] That means this mansion was
also built from my dollars,
[25:52] then this mansion belongs
to Sweetie Madam.
[25:55] Now you will transfer the registration
of this house to my name,
[25:59] right now, first thing.
[26:01] Do you understand?
Don't do this Sweetie,
[26:04] what are you saying?
[26:05] For God's sake have mercy
on my situation.
[26:07] No mercy, no sympathy,
you have to do this right now.
[26:13] This house does not have
anything called privacy,
[26:17] a person cannot even peacefully
argue and their own room,
[26:19] come on, come on.
[26:22] Uncle the guests have arrived.
[26:24] Guests arrived so soon?
[26:26] Actually they wanted to see you
so they came so soon.
[26:29] Oh yes, they also have to meet the rich,
wealthy American daughter-in-law.
[26:35] Uncle, you don't have to
put on any makeup,
[26:37] let her do it, you look good anyway,
come, hurry up.
[26:41] Hey, hey, how ill-mannered she is.
[26:45] Well, nobody can be more
ill-mannered than me,
[26:48] I was famous as the most
belligerent in my village.
[26:51] Also tell me, should I be sorry
about this or proud?
[26:56] I'll tell this to you later.
[27:03] Sister Sweetie will be here,
2 minutes.
[27:07] Greetings,
greetings.
[27:10] Greetings, uncle how are you?
We're good.
[27:14] I'm good uncle
but I'm upset at you.
[27:16] Why? Why are you upset with me,
what did I do?
[27:19] The funny kind, why didn't you bring
aunt to our home?
[27:23] We have such a big house.
[27:24] Yes, yes my child why won't I come,
I'll come.
[27:28] Hey Arbab, come dude,
how are you?
[27:32] I'm absolutely fine.
This fair look suits you.
[27:36] Oh my uncle.
[27:39] Oh pride of this family.
[27:43] Mr. Dabeer.
[27:46] Uncle you humiliate me.
[27:49] You should sit, take a seat.
[27:57] My lovely sister, these are not only
Saman's in-laws
[28:01] they're also the in-laws
of my sister Mona.
[28:03] Please be considerate,
remember I'm on your team,
[28:07] that's Khawar.
[28:12] Here comes your aunt.
[28:14] Hello everyone.
[28:15] Hello.
[28:16] Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[28:20] Yes excuse me,
this is me wealthy Khawar.
[28:23] In coming times, we'll be counted
as one of the most elite people.
[28:28] Oh, so you are Khawar, future elite.
[28:32] It seems like along with your health
your brain is also in a bad condition,
[28:37] you should keep eating like us.
[28:39] We have so many businesses
in America,
[28:41] we don't get impressed
by such small things.
[28:44] Tea, let me get the tea.
[28:46] Yes, you should bring the tea.
[28:48] Aunt, come here, you're so sweet,
come sit with uncle.
[28:51] Sure.
[28:52] Sit, sit. Uncle Rafique,
this is my uncle Rafique.
[28:56] So you don't have anything here
in Pakistan.
[28:59] No here as well,
my father has a village,
[29:03] he is the head of the community
in his village.
[29:04] And he has a lot of cows
and other animals.
[29:09] We're also generationally wealthy,
[29:12] my grandfather's busses used to
roam around the whole Pakistan.
[29:18] Really?
[29:19] My father has horses, cows,
and donkeys as well,
[29:24] and father's donkeys are so famous,
[29:27] they destroy all the fields
in the village.
[29:29] But nobody dares disrespect
my father's donkeys.
[29:33] Yes, yes, at the end of the day
they're donkeys.
[29:36] My grandfather had such big mansions
[29:40] that they used to play polo
in the drawing room.
[29:43] Well my father's mansions are still there,
[29:47] we're still generationally wealthy,
[29:49] not surviving on the past achievements.
[29:52] Sweetie, listen about the present times.
[29:54] You must have heard about
the cut mountain in Karachi,
[29:58] why is it named like this,
this mountain belonged to us,
[30:03] we cut it in half and shipped it
to Lahore to have in our backyard.
[30:08] Oh, oh, let me tell you about
an incident from last year,
[30:12] Trump invited me for tea.
[30:15] Oh.
[30:16] Not oh, not that, this tea.
[30:19] Oh you drank tea.
[30:20] We also drank a lot
but don't mention it in public.
[30:26] We keep drinking.
[30:33] Let it go, let it go,
I was telling you.
[31:13] Should I reheat the dinner for you,
you want some?
[31:16] I am not in the mood.
[31:18] Okay, whatever you want.
[31:21] Are you seeing their behavior against me,
[31:23] this woman's?
She is always after me,
[31:27] I don't know when will she leave,
we will be relieved.
[31:30] Whenever I see her,
she is shooting arrows of tantrums.
[31:34] She thinks, the whole house
is being run on her money,
[31:37] as if we don't do anything,
we're useless.
[31:42] Hello?
[31:43] I am talking to you,
why are you not saying anything?
[31:48] What do I say, it's a matter
of your house.
[31:53] So this house is not yours?
[31:55] You also live here,
you should also say something.
[32:01] I am only a guest here,
I am here today, I will go tomorrow.
[32:08] You have a say in everyone's problems,
help everyone,
[32:11] now that it's about me,
you became a guest?
[32:15] I think you don't need my help,
[32:18] I only help weak people.
[32:20] I have been observing Rania,
[32:21] you've started ignoring me a lot,
[32:25] did you also team up with this woman?
[32:28] There is nothing like that,
[32:30] I have no interest in meddling
in your matters.
[32:33] I'll shift to a hostel very soon,
my classes are about to start.
[32:36] How can you shift to a hostel
just like that?
[32:39] You came here on grandmother's suggestion,
[32:41] I'll see who dares send you away from here.
[32:45] But yes if you try to leave on your own,
[32:49] then do remember,
[32:51] nobody would be worse than me.
[33:01] How good you are at acting,
[33:04] if I hadn't heard those things with Salik,
[33:09] I would have made a fool out of myself.
[33:14] I am talking to grandfather about this,
[33:16] I will shift to a hostel.
I don't want to live here.
[33:29] Greetings.
[33:31] Greetings.
[33:33] You must be here to meet aunt,
come let me get you inside.
[33:36] No, no, no, no. What if I say
I am here to meet you?
[33:40] You haven't been visiting lately?
[33:41] Daily after returning from the office
I make two cups of tea,
[33:46] lit some candle-lights, and make
a romantic environment just to wait for you.
[33:50] But from now on,
you'll have to drink that tea alone.
[33:54] Because I'm going back to the village.
[33:57] Everything alright?
[33:58] Did you get offended
by something I said or did?
[34:02] There is nothing like that.
[34:03] Then why are you going?
[34:06] Because I came here as a guest
now I have to go.
[34:10] Stay a few more days.
[34:14] That's not possible for me anymore.
[34:24] Okay so you met up with Rania
and you invited her to our home?
[34:29] That's awesome.
[34:31] But father tell me,
what did she say?
[34:34] Nothing special.
[34:36] I mean.
[34:38] She is a pretty sweet girl
she agreed instantly.
[34:41] Okay, then she will definitely visit
in a day or two.
[34:45] Father do one thing when she comes,
please call me as well.
[34:49] Why?
[34:50] No, she'll be coming to meet me,
so what will you do?
[34:54] I have something really important
so father please call me.
[35:02] Yes, yes, what this important thing is,
it's being obviously from your face.
[35:07] Father, she,
she is a really nice girl.
[35:09] When did I say she is not nice,
yes, she is an amazing girl.
[35:13] It seems like her parents must've
brought her up in the right manner.
[35:16] Obviously,
[35:19] I am getting late for the hospital,
I'll leave father.
[35:21] Have a good day.
Thank you.
[35:23] Okay.
Bye.
[35:29] Why is he not coming back?
Why is he not coming? His house is next door,
[35:32] where is he, must've stayed for the tea.
[35:36] Come on, he came.
[35:40] Uncle, I don't know
what you make me do things.
[35:47] Come, come and see for yourself,
[35:50] it seems like he hasn't eaten in days.
[35:52] He'll die in a few days.
[35:54] Uncle, what am I seeing?
[35:57] What condition you've made of yourself?
[35:58] I don't want to talk to anyone,
I am heartbroken.
[36:03] They're going, go.
[36:06] Your heart broke for no reason,
[36:08] something must have happened.
[36:09] Not something, a lot of things happened,
that's what he isn't even telling us.
[36:12] That's why we have called you,
he might tell you.
[36:15] I even applied for a job for her
and she left me alone.
[36:26] You're talking about Aunt?
Yes.
[36:30] Aunt rejected your love?
[36:32] It didn't even reach till love confession,
[36:36] the garden died before
spring could arrive.
[36:41] Uncle, the autumn, I mean
aunt's departure has a lot of times.
[36:48] You should go tell her about your love
and confess at least,
[36:51] make her believe in your loyalty.
[36:54] Well I think, they might have been
some effects there as well.
[36:58] What? What? What?
What are you saying?
[37:01] How? Confirmed?
[37:05] Not.
[37:07] But it's my assumption.
[37:10] You shouldn't worry,
I will call grandfather directly
[37:14] and tell him there is a gem like uncle,
who lives in the neighborhood of grandmother.
[37:19] Not uncle, my child, not uncle.
[37:21] Tell him in grandmother's neighborhood
there is a gem like, beautiful gem-like boy.
[37:25] By the way, there would be hardly two years
of an age difference between me and Farhad.
[37:29] Farhad must've been
two years older than me,
[37:31] I've increased the age
because of the government job.
[37:35] Okay, okay, I'll say this,
don't worry.
[37:39] I'll tell him, I've found
a gem-like boy for aunt.
[37:47] You're telling the truth?
This can actually happen?
[37:49] Yes, why won't it happen?
It'll definitely happen.
[37:52] Now think of me
as aunt's representative,
[37:54] I accept this relationship from my side.
[37:56] Done.
Done.
[37:59] Where are the wedding bands playing?
