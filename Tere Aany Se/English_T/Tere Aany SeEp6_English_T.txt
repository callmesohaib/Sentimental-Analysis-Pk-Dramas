[00:19] If you have to bore me like this,
[00:22] then don’t call me.
[00:24] You have gone to your parents’ home
and stayed there for long.
[00:27] You don’t care at all that there is no woman
in this home to take care of the home,
[00:31] to take care of us.
[00:32] And on top of that you want me
to talk to you happily,
[00:35] I praise you for this selfishness of yours.
[00:39] I swear you have become really selfish,
just like your grandma.
[00:42] What did you say? What did you say?
[00:44] You have once again disrespected
my grandmother.
[00:47] Yes, so why doesn’t she make you
understand, man,
[00:49] that go to your in-laws.
[00:50] You fulfil our condition,
I will come.
[00:54] What condition?
[00:56] Wow, that’s great.
You have forgotten already.
[00:59] This is the worth of what the wife and
grandma says in your eyes.
[01:03] Okay,
[01:04] so you are talking about getting
the property in your name, right?
[01:07] Yes, so I am not greedy
for all your wealth,
[01:11] at least put a small land
or home in my name.
[01:13] Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
[01:16] Hey, what? She is talking, let her.
[01:19] You have to interfere in everything.
[01:21] You be quiet.
[01:22] Hey Saman, one home,
two shops, this is nothing,
[01:26] it is all yours. All yours.
[01:28] Don’t try to fool me,
[01:30] I know the dialogues of clever men
like you really well.
[01:33] First you trap your wife in your love
[01:35] and you don’t give her a penny
in the name of love.
[01:38] Very good. Very good.
[01:39] So this means you are not coming?
[01:41] Yes, so fulfil my wish,
I will come today.
[01:44] This is not your wish,
this is your mama’s wish,
[01:47] that I will never fulfil,
[01:48] because maybe she doesn’t know
that this wealth,
[01:52] this land means nothing in the true love
of husband and wife.
[01:58] For God’s sake,
think about what I said.
[02:00] Okay?
Goodbye.
[02:04] What happened?
What was he saying?
[02:06] The home is empty without me,
[02:10] it is really haphazard,
so he was missing me.
[02:12] Hey, what did he say
about the property?
[02:14] Is he naming it to you?
[02:17] No.
[02:19] Then fine,
[02:20] there is no need for you
to go back there,
[02:23] stay here.
[02:24] Hey, why is there no need?
[02:26] Sister Saman, that is your home,
you should surely go.
[02:30] That is not Saman’s home,
it is Mr. Arbab’s home.
[02:33] So who does Mr. Arbab belong to?
[02:35] Sister Saman. Right?
[02:39] Saman, you have seen the amazing feats
this girl has achieved with her thinking,
[02:42] don’t focus on anything she says.
You won’t go there.
[02:47] Why are you speaking in the matter
of husband and wife?
[02:50] Sister Saman, he is creating misunderstandings
between you and your husband.
[02:54] He doesn’t want to get married
himself, and neither
does he want anyone else to remain married.
[02:56] I think he has a mental issue.
[02:58] Hey, I am already really
upset with you,
[03:00] don’t upset me further.
Go from here.
[03:03] Saman, you won’t go anywhere.
[03:06] Yes, here Mr. Mahir is waiting to put
all the property in your name,
[03:10] wait to gather it.
What will Mr. Arbab give you?
[03:13] You know, point to ponder, sister.
[03:15] The demands you have put
in front of your husband,
[03:18] if you put the same in front of
your sympathetic brother,
[03:20] then you will see
what answer do you get.
[03:22] Do think about what I said.
[03:30] Saman.
Yes?
[03:32] This girl is stupid.
[03:34] Don’t pay attention
to anything she says.
[03:37] This is no longer the issue
between you two.
[03:39] It is our matter it is a matter of our home,
[03:41] it is a matter of our respect.
[03:42] And most importantly
it is a matter of aunt’s ego.
[03:46] Till he doesn’t fulfil the requirements,
you are not going anywhere.
[04:07] The wind is really fast today.
[04:09] Rabail.
Yes?
[04:11] All else is fine
[04:13] but I was thinking we should
have a plant of jasmine here.
[04:16] Yes, but we can also plant
another flower,
[04:19] why a jasmine flower?
[04:21] It looks really good.
[04:22] The flowers are pure and white,
[04:25] and the scent, oh man,
[04:27] it touches the soul,
it refreshes a person.
[04:29] I will talk to mama,
[04:31] I will get a plant of jasmine here.
[04:33] It will look really good.
[04:36] Hello.
[04:37] Hello.
[04:39] How are you?
[04:41] I am fine, how are you?
[04:45] Thank God I got to see you.
[04:48] Hey, at times I am inside the home,
sometimes outside, I don’t get to see you.
[04:56] Visit our home for a change.
We live next door.
[04:59] Yes, yes, I will come. I will.
[05:02] I am just a little busy right now,
but I will visit soon
[05:06] you talk so much.
[05:10] Why don’t you talk? Are you fasting?
[05:13] No, she is not fasting.
[05:16] Then why don’t you speak?
Now, what can I say?
[05:19] Rania is answering to every question,
so how can I speak?
[05:23] I asked you a question,
I also want the answer from you.
[05:32] Actually, I wanted salt, we have
run out of salt in our home.
[05:36] Oh, salt.
We have a lot of salt at home.
[05:39] Tell me, how much do you want?
I will go and get it.
[05:41] Around, two spoons.
[05:43] I will get it in two minutes.
[05:45] I will get two spoons of salt soon.
Greetings sir,
[05:49] I am Farhad.
I live next door.
[05:55] Mahir.
[05:57] This home is mine.
[05:59] I mean, my own, personal
[06:03] and all the people who live here,
[06:05] their food, their expenses,
[06:08] all their responsibility,
I am the guy.
[06:11] Yes, yes, all our responsibility
is on his weak shoulders.
[06:16] Oh..
[06:18] What are you doing here?
[06:19] I am introducing you nicely.
[06:23] Salt.
[06:24] Hey, thank you so much.
[06:26] Had I not got this salt today,
[06:29] then we would have had
to eat tasteless food.
[06:31] I am surprised.
[06:32] In our Khushalpur,
[06:35] neighbours come to each other’s home
without hesitating, they eat freely.
[06:38] Once I smell pulao,
I land at their home.
[06:42] So cute.
You two go inside.
[06:45] Grandma was asking about you.
[06:50] Okay, goodbye.
[06:51] Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[06:54] Is this your bike?
[06:57] Yes.
[06:59] There is sound in its silencer,
get it fixed.
[07:04] I have a Hayabusa,
[07:07] I am speaking about of experience.
[07:11] Busa?
[07:16] Oh hello,
[07:18] wait.
[07:19] Listen to me, frank neighbour.
[07:22] What was this?
[07:23] Are you on a mission to get us
insulted everywhere?
[07:27] What would he be thinking about us?
The smell of pulao?
[07:30] Quick neighbour.
I don’t know what.
[07:36] I think I stepped on his tail again.
[07:45] Sister.
[07:47] Hey, sister.
What is it?
[07:50] Sister Rabail has asked me to make tea,
should I make it for you too?
[07:53] I don’t want it.
You go from here.
[07:55] Don’t disturb me now.
Leave.
[07:58] Fine.
[08:00] Where was my hand?
[08:02] Shehanshah, get tea and
two to three biscuits.
[08:10] Huh?
[08:14] Why are you standing here
like a sad pigeon?
[08:17] Nothing,
[08:19] I just don’t want to talk to anyone.
[08:22] Yes,
[08:23] when you hand over the management of
your life to these people with fake respect,
[08:31] name and worth, this will happen.
[08:34] Your life is ruined.
[08:39] Ruined?
[08:40] Yes.
 And he?
[08:42] He will play music in the victory
of his fake pride.
[08:47] And remember one thing,
in fact, I would say note it down,
[08:50] this person will turn out
to be a wife’s pet.
[08:55] How is that?
[08:57] The boys who are arrogant,
they have a bad attitude
[09:01] and show tantrums,
[09:03] when their wife comes,
[09:05] she fixes them.
[09:08] Then they don’t remember any ego,
[09:10] nor do they care about
the family’s name.
[09:14] Tell me,
[09:17] did you come to this home
on a mission?
[09:21] Or have you been officially launched?
[09:24] Hey, since you have come,
you are after me.
[09:27] I didn’t even know you.
[09:29] You are insulting me everywhere,
in front of everyone.
[09:32] Oh God,
[09:33] you get insulted really easily.
[09:36] Poor me came on the mission
to get my admission.
[09:40] Then get your admission done,
leave us alone.
[09:46] I wont leave you alone
for the next two years.
[09:49] The thing is, now that I have come,
I will leave after my masters.
[09:53] After all, there is a long time
to the admission.
[09:56] By the way, tell me something,
[09:58] what have I done to you?
What have I done?
[10:02] What have you done?
[10:03] Hey, you are after me from day one.
[10:05] I bought the bus ticket and
she snatched the seat.
[10:09] I booked the taxi,
she went away in it.
[10:11] And God knows who she was
forcefully getting me married to.
[10:14] She went in front of the neighbours
and spoke nonsense,
[10:17] she got my respect ruined
there as well,
[10:20] and then she asks,
what have I done?
[10:24] Sister Rania, you have shaken
the cores of this home.
[10:28] You have been disrespecting
brother Mahir again and again.
[10:32] Again and again.
[10:34] In front of him,
not even mama says anything,
[10:37] she listens to him quietly.
[10:39] You turned out to be superman’s sister.
[10:42] Wow, sister Rania,
wow, amazing.
[10:44] Wow Rania, wow.
[10:46] You turned out to be something great.
Right?
[10:49] Applause.
Wow, you are really intelligent.
[10:52] Wow, this is great, a single girl
dared to do so much.
[10:53] This is great. Wow.
Hey, be quiet.
[10:55] Silence.
[10:56] I didn’t tell you all this to you people
so that you people praise her.
[11:02] They are honest people,
they speak the truth,
[11:04] they like the truth,
[11:06] and you cannot keep them under your
pressure for a long time. Understand?
[11:09] Oh, hello. Calm down.
[11:12] You are a guest in our home,
only that’s why I am tolerating you,
[11:17] or else I…
Really?
[11:20] What? Or else what? Or else
what would you have done?
[11:22] I would have squished you
between my fingers like this.
[11:27] He paid the bus fare,
I took the seat.
[11:31] He hired the cab,
and I escaped in it.
[11:34] I was not your guest then,
[11:36] what were you able to do, then?
Who are you threatening?
[11:40] Grandma.
[11:42] Grandma.
[11:44] I will go complain to grandma,
and I will tell her
[11:46] that even if idiots like this girl
get educated,
[11:49] still nothing will change for them,
[11:52] they will stay illiterate.
[11:54] I will go talk to grandma right now,
[11:55] I will get your bags packed and have you
sent away from here to your village.
[12:00] Okay listen,
[12:01] develop the courage to hear
the truth and face it.
[12:05] It will be great for you, I swear.
[12:09] Wow.
Well done.
[12:14] You find it really funny.
You find it really funny?
[12:16] Brother Mahir. Brother Mahir,
he is a child.
[12:33] Why have you made
the environment so tense?
[12:37] Such small quarrels happen in my life.
[12:40] It is okay.
Chill.
[12:42] Shahanshah, pour tea.
You come on.
[12:48] All is fine, but I am worried cause of Saman.
[12:52] What happened to Saman, mama?
[12:54] Her centipede like father in law,
you know him, right?
[12:57] Do you know what worth and
what position those people were in.
[13:01] And now?
[13:02] He starts talking about money
and ends it on money.
[13:06] You are right, mama.
[13:07] And us, who were from a rich family
have come to America,
[13:11] in this cold weather and sighing.
[13:14] We are working day and night,
putting in effort like donkeys.
[13:18] I swear mama, look at my hands,
[13:20] they are crooked,
their shape has changed.
[13:24] Hey, why?
[13:26] Has the shape of your hands
also turned like your feet?
[13:29] Leave it, I know well how much hard work
you put in.
[13:32] The sons that go from Pakistan
who go to America to work,
[13:35] they send so much money that
they setup of grand palaces in Pakistan.
[13:40] Then there is us,
the grand home we live in,
[13:44] it was built selling the wealth
your father left us.
[13:48] We hardly survive with
the money you send us.
[13:53] Who are you talking to mama?
[13:55] Uncle Naveed.
[13:56] This is Rania,
[13:58] your uncle Anwar’s grand daughter.
[14:00] Okay. Okay.
[14:01] How are you child? How is uncle?
[14:05] Your uncle is fine.
[14:09] Oh, but I…
[14:12] what do I tell you about myself?
[14:14] But if you are asking me,
I will tell you.
[14:16] Hey, since I have come to this home,
[14:19] I have gotten tired of getting insulted.
[14:23] Insult?
[14:24] Hey child, who can insult you?
[14:27] Who has the courage?
[14:28] Your son.
[14:30] He considers himself the son
of a king and nor yours.
[14:33] And he considers the whole family,
especially me his servant.
[14:39] He orders everyone around,
all the time.
[14:42] Now see, I am a guest,
I am here today,
[14:46] I will leave in two years,
[14:47] but this family,
[14:50] my heart is really sad seeing them.
[14:52] Mama, what is this I hear?
[14:55] Hey, nothing.
[14:56] You know both of them are smart
and they are also strong headed.
[15:00] I will handle it.
[15:03] You worry about sending money.
[15:05] It is Mahir’s birthday on the first of
next month it is also Mahir’s birthday,
[15:09] and you how big of
a function he arranges.
[15:12] And then Saman is also over,
[15:14] if not sooner or later,
she will go home.
[15:17] I will not send her empty handed.
[15:20] I will send her with so much that
Anwar’s father is left looking,
[15:25] in fact, he will be left staring.
[15:27] Yes. Yes. Yes, mama.
You are right. Absolutely right.
[15:32] Okay, I will try then, mama.
[15:35] Goodbye then.
[15:37] Hey wait,
[15:39] where is that queen of yours?
Huh?
[15:41] Does she not have the time
to come and greet me?
[15:43] Mama, I…I…I..I had to go to work,
mama.
[15:48] I think she is ironing my clothes.
I will ask her.
[15:52] Sweety,
[15:55] are my clothes ironed?
[15:58] She is ironing my clothes,
I will let you talk to her next time.
[16:02] Okay goodbye. Bye.
[16:04] Rania child, goodbye.
[16:07] You don’t need to worry about anything,
[16:09] I will talk to him well. How dare he?
[16:13] Damn him.
[16:14] Yes, you don’t worry.
[16:16] Goodbye. Goodbye.
[16:19] Here you go, my work is done.
[16:22] Look at that,
[16:24] she is messing with the lion
staying in the jungle.
[16:28] God be kind.
[16:31] I will become like aunt Rania
when I grow up.
[16:36] My love, don’t say this
in front of your brother Mahir,
[16:39] or else all hell will break loose.
[16:41] Yes, for no reason.
[16:44] What is the matter?
Everyone is smiling.
[16:47] I feel that you people are talking
about something special.
[16:48] Guess what is so special?
[16:51] Rabail’s marriage?
[16:52] Oh sister, fear God, stop this marriage,
marriage, marriage, marriage.
[16:57] Stop this marriage discussion.
Now you are after sister Rabail.
[17:00] Don’t be sad,
his wife will come fix him.
[17:05] Are we playing a game?
Yes.
[17:07] Can I play too?
Yes.
[17:09] Come sister, sit here.
Come. Come.
[17:17] Hey. Hey, idiot.
[17:19] You are asking me for so much
for your birthday.
[17:23] You will feed my hard-earned money
to useless people, huh?
[17:27] Hey, do I earn by unlawful means here?
[17:30] This is the limit.
[17:31] You just ask me to send you
dollars from here.
[17:34] I am surprised. And that niece of mine
at home, Rania,
[17:37] you threaten her?
[17:40] Who? That Rania?
[17:43] Dad, can someone threaten her?
[17:46] Now you see yourself,
[17:47] you are sitting so far from home,
[17:49] and she called you and complained
about me falsely.
[17:53] Hey, she didn’t tell me anything.
[17:55] Stop it, dad.
Don’t try to cover up for her.
[17:57] If she didn’t tell you,
then how did you find out?
[18:00] Hey, I am your father.
Your father.
[18:04] I am updated on whatever happens
their every moment.
[18:07] What do you think of yourself?
[18:10] That I won’t find out?
[18:11] I know. I know everything.
[18:13] Hey, listen to me carefully.
[18:16] If in future you say anything to Raina,
then I will come straight to Pakistan,
[18:21] I will beat you up, I will….
[18:25] I am your father or
are you my father?
[18:31] Okay. Okay, dad.
I accept what you are saying.
[18:35] Now get my work done too.
[18:37] Dad, I have so many friends,
and they are all asking for a treat.
[18:39] Send some dollars.
Yes, celebrate your birthday.
[18:44] If you don’t celebrate it,
then will I celebrate it.
[18:46] Your father is alive,
[18:48] had my father been alive,
[18:50] I too would have been having a good time.
[18:53] I too would have been having a good time.
[18:56] Your father is alive,
you feed people.
[18:58] Hey, invite them for my funeral,
feed them what I earn.
[19:03] This is the limit.
I don’t have parents.
[19:07] I have to work hard.
[19:11] How much money do you want?
[19:13] Oh, yes, thank you dad.
Thank you so much.
[19:16] Bye.
[19:21] She complained about me.
[19:28] I will cook something good and
take it to the neighbours.
[19:31] This way I will also get to meet them.
[19:33] I only see lentils,
have we only cooked lentils?
[19:39] Hey, lentils again, today?
[19:42] Oh, Uncle?
[19:44] Uncle!
[19:47] what is this uncle?
[19:48] We have lentils again at home.
[19:51] I am telling you,
[19:52] some learned man, has told mama
not to cook good food.
[19:57] They are serving mutton
thrice a week at shrines.
[19:59] At shrines.
[20:00] My whole plan is ruined.
[20:03] I had a great idea.
[20:06] I was thinking that
I will keep it in a plate,
[20:09] put a handkerchief on it.
What the hell will I take?
[20:12] I will get insulted.
We have cooked lentils at home.
[20:17] Last time I went to ask for salt,
this time chili.
[20:20] No, not chili, it is a bad idea.
[20:22] Tea leaf.
Yes, tea leaf.
[20:24] Tea leaf is a good excuse.
[20:26] I will go ask for tea,
they will say son,
[20:28] why do you want tea leaf,
you come and have tea with us.
[20:31] Yes, tea leaf is fine.
[20:37] Hey, nephew, you are singing a lot.
[20:41] Oh yes, to celebrate the hat-trick of lentils.
[20:43] Because the homes in which the doors
of the home are closed on wedding functions,
[20:48] in those homes a person can also celebrate
eating lentils three days in a row.
[20:51] Dance.
Dance.
[20:54] Hey, the menu in the jail has also changed,
you don’t even get lentils there.
[21:00] Tea leaf.
[21:02] Mama, the food is ready,
I have cooked it.
[21:05] Tell the girls to make bread,
so that we eat quickly.
[21:08] Where are the girls?
I don’t hear any noise.
[21:12] Rania is teaching Rabail
how to ride a bike.
[21:15] They are all gathered there.
Really?
[21:18] You know, Rania is really brave.
[21:20] She does it first,
thinks later.
[21:22] Hey, see, the way Mahir is our beloved,
[21:25] just like that she is her
grandfather’s beloved.
[21:28] Oh, only her grandfather’s beloved?
[21:31] Not her father’s?
Doesn’t he care for her?
[21:34] She lives with her grandfather.
[21:36] Doesn’t the father live with
the grandfather?
[21:38] Does he live somewhere else?
Why?
[21:41] Shehanshah, where are you?
[21:44] Yes, mama, go ahead.
[21:46] Go, tell the girls outside to come inside.
[21:49] Is this the time for them to ride the bike.
[21:50] Come and prepare bread,
Mahir too must be on his way.
[21:53] Go.
[21:54] Okay mama, I will go.
[21:56] Listen,
[21:58] ask Hamad to come to me,
I also have to lecture him.
[22:01] Okay, mama.
[22:06] She thinks highly of herself,
she doesn’t live with her father,
[22:09] where is the father?
I will just tell you.
[22:13] Oh God, your creation has a
small request,
[22:16] the one who is going to meet,
make him meet her.
[22:19] Ameen. Bell. Bell. Bell. Yes, Bell.
[22:27] I pray to God, she comes.
She comes. She comes.
[22:30] Where is she?
[22:31] Yes?
[22:36] Greetings, how are you?
[22:39] Greetings. Yes, go ahead?
[22:43] Are you home all day long? I mean,
don’t you come out anywhere?
[22:48] You came to ask about this?
[22:50] Hey, no, no, I was asking
this as your neighbour.
[22:52] Actually, today we are out of tea left
in our home,
[22:55] I really wanted to have tea.
If you can give me tea leaf, then…
[22:59] Yes. Yes. I will just get the tea leaf.
[23:02] She has such a dry temperament.
[23:04] A person is saying they want tea leaf,
they feel like having tea,
[23:07] you invite them in, but no.
[23:09] Damn you Faraz,
you fell for such a girl.
[23:13] Hey, Mr. Neighbour, you?
Did you ring the bell?
[23:17] Yes, I did this stupidity.
[23:20] Okay, so you were going to run away after
ringing the bell and I caught you, right?
[23:25] I am a really smart girl, you cannot be saved
from me, you know!
[23:29] Here you go.
What is this?
[23:31] Tea leaf.
[23:34] He came to get tea leaf,
and you gave it.
[23:36] Well done, I am proud of such great,
smart citizens like you.
[23:42] You come inside, I will make tea
for you and get it for you.
[23:45] Come on. Come in.
Yes, sure, sure, sure.
[23:49] I am sorry, it is your home.
Sorry. Sorry.
[23:52] I was a little too happy.
Come in. Come in.
[23:53] Sure. Sure.
[24:04] Mama, I am running out of patience.
[24:08] You have such a stupid
and useless son,
[24:11] he knows nothing apart
from playing games on the mobile.
[24:14] He does. He does.
[24:17] He knows how to love,
he can insist to get married.
[24:22] Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
[24:24] I had said that my son is lazy,
he is useless, he knows nothing.
[24:30] But you didn’t listen.
[24:32] I was your enemy back then.
[24:34] Now suffer. Suffer. Suffer yourself,
don’t complain to me.
[24:37] Mama, you too…
I had lost my mind back then.
[24:40] A person makes mistakes.
[24:42] Right now, give me money,
I have to go shopping.
[24:44] Mama, look here,
give her money.
[24:48] I swear, she treats me
so badly in the room,
[24:50] I cannot tell you. I shed tears.
[24:53] Die. Oh God,
[24:56] you have defamed my entire family.
[25:00] You shed tears.
[25:02] Don’t say anything like this
in front of my Mahir,
[25:04] my son has a lot of self-respect.
[25:06] Oh my, may I die.
He shed tears. He shed tears.
[25:10] Promise by God, we will come back
and listen to you praise Mahir.
[25:14] Right now, give us money,
we are short on time.
[25:16] Hey, do I have trees with
money growing on them?
[25:18] You are always asking for money.
[25:20] Freeloaders, useless people,
they come over just like that.
[25:25] What happened to her?
[25:26] Don’t worry,
these titles are not for you.
[25:29] Yes, this is mama’s love,
she has not gotten upset.
[25:34] This is love. If this is love,
then she must shoot bullets in her anger.
[25:39] Try to upset her,
she is sitting right in front of you.
[25:41] Just kidding. Come on,
come inside. Come inside.
[25:43] Mama.
[25:45] Mama, this innocent boy
is your neighbour.
[25:50] Greetings.
[25:52] Greetings.
[25:54] How are you?
[25:56] Hey didn’t you bother too soon?
Huh?
[26:00] Meaning asking how neighbours is a custom,
[26:08] but only people from good families
understand it.
[26:13] And people nowadays inspired
by fashion know nothing of this.
[26:19] Hey, we have been in this home
for two months, yes?
[26:23] And during this time, we didn’t see
a single damned neighbour’s face.
[26:29] Mama, they shifted here two weeks back
[26:33] and they too have the same complaint
from her neighbours.
[26:36] Mama, what is the order for us?
[26:40] You too ask how the neighbour is,
how he is feeling?
[26:43] Greetings Mr. Neighbour, how are you?
Are you fine? Are you feeling okay?
[26:46] Do visit soon. Fine?
[26:49] Yes, yes, absolutely,
[26:52] it feels really homely here and this mama,
[26:55] mama is just like my mama, really sweet.
[26:58] She is a lovely woman.
[27:00] We have the same liveliness in our home.
[27:03] and I am this home’s and
mama’s lucky daughter in law.
[27:06] And I have the responsibility
of the entire home on me.
[27:09] Grocery and everything else.
[27:10] We have so many expenses,
[27:13] but we are from a good family
and we have good expenses,
[27:15] and mama? Mama gives me money
for the grocery.
[27:18] Mama has such a big heart.
[27:20] You ask her for twenty thousand,
she gives you thirty thousand.
[27:22] Wow, wow, wow.
Mama give me the money,
[27:23] we are running out of time
for the grocery.
[27:28] Okay, here you go.
[27:32] Wallet. Okay fine, wallet.
[27:37] One, two, three.
[27:41] Here.
Come on, let’s go.
[27:44] Thank you, mama.
[27:46] And thank you very much,
you came at the right time.
[27:49] Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[27:56] When children, dish,
[28:01] they are of ten.
[28:05] Shehanshah, it is not of ten,
it is often.
[28:08] My ears hurt hearing your English.
[28:11] Shehanshah,
make a cup of tea quickly.
[28:13] Sister, can you not see,
I am studying English.
[28:16] Shehanshah, please make a cup of tea.
[28:17] Please make it quickly.
Mama has strictly told me
[28:20] there is no need to do any work
in between my studies.
[28:24] If I fail this time, she will take my
thirteen pro and sell it off.
[28:31] Come on, go.
[28:32] This boy doesn’t do
any work properly ever.
[28:35] I have already been insulted so much.
[28:37] Sister, I am making tea,
you quickly fry kebabs.
[28:41] Why? Do we have any guests over?
My in-laws?
[28:45] Not at all.
[28:46] Those poor people will come here after
they put bandages on their old wounds.
[28:50] What do you mean?
[28:51] Meaning that the servants of this home
is much more than your in-laws.
[28:57] I don’t know what I am talking about.
[28:58] I am making tea,
you please quickly fry kebabs.
[29:00] The neighbours from next door are here.
[29:03] Hmmm.
[29:07] What is your name and what do you do?
[29:10] My name is Faraz.
[29:11] I am a student, I am studying law.
[29:13] I have a bright future.
[29:16] Mama, I feel that he is smart just like me.
[29:22] You have knowledge of the unknown?
[29:24] Unknown? No.
[29:27] Then how do you know
you have a bright future?
[29:30] We have seen many people with
degrees going around aimlessly.
[29:36] Oh man,
[29:37] you are just like my grandma.
[29:40] She too is like this.
[29:43] She is out spoken like you,
I mean, she insults really badly.
[29:46] I have a request from you,
[29:50] give me permission
to come to your home.
[29:52] This way, I will keep on looking at you
and feasting my eyes.
[29:55] Please.
You have my permission.
[29:58] We have a grand temperament
and open heart
[30:02] We have no issues with guests.
Even if 100 people come over,
[30:06] we don’t care.
[30:07] Just stay great like this.
[30:10] Life will be made.
[30:11] Whose?
Mine, I mean, how much is left?
[30:15] Oh.
[30:16] So what does your father do?
[30:18] Nothing.
[30:21] Huh?
[30:23] Rania, I feel that in the neighbours there is also
a fashion of breaking beds just like our home.
[30:28] Yes, mama it feels that way.
[30:31] Hey, no, no, mama.
[30:33] Actually, my father passed away,
so what do I tell you?
[30:39] He is not in the world,
so what will he do?
[30:41] And what is your family background?
[30:45] I don’t know.
[30:46] I mean, I don’t know about it,
but my mama knows.
[30:50] My mama is a working woman,
she is really educated.
[30:53] When you meet her, you will really like it.
[30:56] The neighbours are not as per our standard.
[30:58] When the boy doesn’t know of his ancestors,
[31:01] hey, if they had done something great,
then the mother would have told them.
[31:05] Right. Absolutely right, mama.
[31:11] You have tea now.
[31:13] Yes. Yes.
Go ahead, have tea.
[31:16] Can I get water?
[31:17] Sure.
[31:37] Daughter.
[31:38] Yes, mama?
You call home, right?
[31:41] Yes. Yes.
[31:42] I talk to them 10 times in the day.
[31:44] Oh God.
[31:46] Don’t worry, I have praised
everyone here a lot.
[31:48] And I have also said that
everyone really cares for me.
[31:51] Really?
Yes,
[31:53] and the family aside, even
the neighbours miss me a lot.
[31:57] Oh, that’s good.
[31:59] Yes, yes, you people don’t worry
about anything. I am here.
[32:02] All the arrangements have been made.
One second. Hold on for a second.
[32:05] Grandma, I gave you my charger,
where is it?
[32:07] It is there.
It is there, okay?
[32:09] Yes. Yes, invite as many guests as you want,
invite the whole class.
[32:13] It is Mahir’s birthday. Restaurant?
[32:16] Hey, I got a booking in a five star hotel
as per my standard.
[32:20] Yes, yes, invite everyone.
[32:22] Invite them. No problem.
Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
[32:26] Expenses all the time.
[32:28] Birthday.
[32:29] God knows who he did a favour to,
getting born.
[32:32] Oh mama, very good news.
My Mona is coming.
[32:35] Really?
[32:36] She too will be there on Mahir’s birthday.
[32:39] I will inform her,
to get ready well.
[32:43] Grandma,
[32:45] now why is this Mona giving
an entry in our home?
[32:48] She is her sister.
She is coming to meet her sister.
[32:50] You are mistaken that
she is coming in her love.
[32:53] You don’t know,
[32:56] she is a big drama.
After all, grandma,
[33:00] do we not have enough
useless people in this home,
[33:02] that this Mona will come as well?
[33:04] Useless?
[33:07] Who did you call useless?
[33:09] Hey…
[33:10] Mama, did you hear
what he is calling me.
[33:12] I have had enough,
call uncle Naveed right now,
[33:14] I too will tell him that God knows why
his son considers himself a prince.
[33:18] Call? Why?
How is he talking about me?
[33:20] Rania, child, you stop being upset,
stop it.
[33:23] No mama, today I will make sure
I talk to uncle Naveed.
[33:27] Why are you standing quietly?
Say sorry.
[33:30] I? I say sorry to her?
[33:32] Yes, say sorry. She is the attachment
of my parents’ home and…
[33:35] and your only granddaughter
of your only brother,
[33:37] she is the heir of the home,
she has come to make our home lively.
[33:41] And we see how well
she has made this home lively.
[33:44] Really?
[33:46] Now I understand, mama,
actually, he is jealous of me.
[33:51] Mama, did you not tell her,
explain to him,
[33:54] that the one who is jealous
only face loss themselves.
[33:56] It is my heart that is soft,
[33:57] I don’t want that your son burns
to ashes in his jealousy.
[34:00] Me?
[34:02] Grandma, I will be jealous of her?
Yes, you are jealous of me,
[34:06] and you don’t even know,
[34:07] let me become prime minister once,
then he is a goner.
[34:11] What?
[34:13] Prime minister?
[34:20] Grandma,
[34:22] she will become the prime minister?
[34:25] Prime Minister.
[34:27] Grandma, if she becomes
the prime minister,
[34:30] then the whole world will give us
donations themselves.
[34:38] Pakistan will progress a lot.
[34:41] Okay, the food is served,
just have food.
[34:44] And please don’t make
so many stories again,
[34:48] he has a stomach ache
cause of laughter.
[34:54] Grandma, the prime minister’s protocol
is coming on a cycle.
[35:00] What if someday the wind blows fast,
and the prime minister flies away.
[35:05] Stop it.
[35:07] You will get unwell,
stop laughing.
[35:14] Hey, what did your mother say to you?
[35:16] That you don’t have to talk about
the prime minister, in front of others.
[35:21] People laugh then.
[35:23] They are stupid.
[35:25] They laugh, that is why they cannot
become the prime minister. Idiots.
[35:29] It slipped my tongue,
and so what if I said it?
[35:33] Can I not become the prime minister?
What do I lack?
[35:36] Yes, my beloved,
[35:39] what do you lack?
What are you saying?
[35:43] No. No. See,
you can become what you want.
[35:48] Mahir doesn’t know you,
we do.
[35:51] That is why I am telling you that
you keep your plan to yourself.
[35:58] Yes,
[35:59] you know I can even get
an evil eye like this Mian Jee.
[36:01] You are right.
[36:03] Okay tell me,
has my mark sheet arrived?
[36:05] Yes, it has arrived.
[36:07] You think I will send it
to you in a day or two.
[36:10] You know I was thinking
[36:12] that I too come to Lahore there,
[36:16] and I will get you admitted
and come back.
[36:19] Hey, no, no,
how will you come to the city?
[36:21] You have a lot of work there anyway.
[36:23] Believe me,
I will do everything here myself.
[36:25] Don’t worry. Okay?
[36:27] Hey Rani, we believe you,
that is why we sent you so far.
[36:31] Had we not believed in you then
we would have made you stay at home.
[36:50] I came to find out if this is their home or not.
[36:53] Someone is standing there.
[36:57] Excuse me.
[36:59] Is this Mahir’s home?
[37:02] Yes. Yes. 
This is her home.
[37:03] You? Mona.
 Are you Mona?
[37:08] None of us is Mona,
[37:10] we are Mahir’s friends and since
he shifted we came for the first time.
[37:14] Oh, then you have come
to the right home.
[37:17] Come on, come inside.
[37:18] Mahir has two more friends too,
should I call them?
[37:21] Yes, yes, you surprise me, when they can come,
then why can’t they come?
[37:24] Salik. Jahanzaib.
Here we are.
[37:27] Which amongst them is Salik?
[37:29] Yes, I am Salik.
[37:31] I am Ifrah and this is Tania.
[37:33] Hey, Ifrah.
[37:34] You have no idea,
how much I wanted to meet you.
[37:39] You know me?
[37:41] Didn’t Mahir tell you?
[37:43] Hey because of you we had such
a big scene in our home.
[37:46] And your friend. Mr. Mahir,
[37:48] he almost got caught up
in such a big misunderstanding.
[37:52] Mahir didn’t tell me all this.
[37:54] he didn’t tell you? So what?
I will tell you. I am here.
[37:57] Come on. Come on.
Lets go inside.
[37:59] Come on. Come on.
You people also come.
[38:03] Come on, come in.
Come in. Come in.
[38:06] Shehanshah.
[38:09] Shahenshah.
[38:11] Go call your sir Mahir,
his friends are here.
[38:15] Go. Go. Go. Go.
[38:16] Come on. Come on.
You people come sit comfortably.
[38:20] Right now, Mahir will wake up,
[38:22] he will take out his branded clothes,
[38:25] get them ironed, wear them and come.
[38:27] By the way, you are his friends,
why don’t you make him understand?
[38:30] Hey, for a friend a friend is dear,
not his branded clothes.
[38:35] Er…
[38:36] you are right, but…
Hi guys, what’s up?
[38:40] Hey you people had come over,
you should have told me earlier.
[38:42] I would have come sooner.
How are you?
[38:43] Buddy, we thought
we would surprise you,
[38:46] but you are dressed up in a way
that maybe you are going somewhere.
[38:51] Hey, this is my swag.
[38:54] I stay this way at home too.
With style.
[38:58] What are you doing standing here?
[39:01] We have guests over,
make arrangements for tea for them.
[39:04] Sure.
Go.
[39:06] Who is this girl? Is she a relative?
Relative?
[39:08] Hey, she is my servant,
[39:10] she works at home.
[39:12] She and my relative?
[39:14] I am not going through such a bad time.
[39:16] Hey, to be my relative,
a person should have class,
[39:20] they should have some standard.
