[00:21] Mian Jee, I agree it is my fault.
[00:24] Whatever happened, it is all my fault.
[00:28] That is why I am begging you
for forgiveness today.
[00:33] Mian Jee,
[00:35] all of us came to apologize
on his behalf.
[00:39] But brother Zaman has
fixed Rania’s decision.
[00:43] Hey, to hell with it.
[00:46] I mean, to hell with that proposal,
Mian Jee.
[00:50] Look at our boy, see his face.
He is sitting embarrassed.
[00:54] Hey, turn your face. See.
[00:59] Mian Jee,
who doesn’t make mistake,
[01:02] brother Zaman made a mistake,
[01:04] everyone forgave him.
[01:06] Forgive this poor thing too,
Mian Jee.
[01:09] Mian Jee, don’t sit quietly like that.
[01:12] Say something.
[01:15] Forgive me.
[01:18] I will also apologize to Rania.
[01:20] Yes, Mian Jee, and brother will
even say no to the proposal
[01:23] that has been fixed with Honey.
[01:24] Hey, Honey…Honey was just a drama,
Mian Jee.
[01:28] You know it.
It is a no from me for her.
[01:31] Hey, I know it was a drama,
there is no such emergency.
[01:36] Mian Jee, I don’t have this
big grand home,
[01:42] a lot of money,
and big business like uncle Zaman.
[01:47] But I promise you, Mian Jee,
[01:50] I will work really hard,
[01:52] I will do something on my own,
I will be successful.
[01:58] Please listen to me,
[02:01] don’t take Rania away from me.
[02:03] I will accept,
[02:05] but who will make Zaman understand?
[02:09] Hey, my legs hurt bad, here.
[02:12] Massage it. Yes. Yes.
[02:14] Hey Mian Jee, if you say something to him,
how will he say no?
[02:18] He cannot reject what you say.
[03:47] Understanding you is the most
difficult thing in the world.
[03:50] Yes, so who told you
to research on me?
[03:53] Rania,
[03:56] don’t you care about the feelings
of anyone else?
[03:59] You do, right?
[04:01] so you go and tell him to consider you
his daughter from today.
[04:04] God forbid.
[04:08] He is talking about his feelings,
[04:10] I am talking about my feeling.
[04:14] Your?
[04:15] Feelings?
[04:20] You are amongst those people
who only live for themselves.
[04:25] Your ego gets hurts
on every small thing,
[04:27] and if you raise your voice
it is for your own right.
[04:31] if you do anything then it is for yourself,
for your benefit.
[04:35] I don’t want to waste my time
on a man like you.
[04:40] Do you understand?
[04:44] Rania,
[04:49] do you really think about me like this?
[04:52] Yes, that’s how I think about you and
this opinion will not change.
[05:30] Hi Rabail.
[05:32] Oh wow, you recognized me.
[05:36] I thought, just like brother
you have forgotten all of us too.
[05:40] I had no such relation with your brother,
[05:43] but yes, you are my friend
[05:47] I have a deep relation with you.
[05:50] You are lying to yourself again.
[05:52] Stop it, Rania.
[05:54] All of us can see the relation
you have with brother.
[05:57] But you two?
[05:59] You two have been stupid on your own
and are on a mission to ruin this relation.
[06:04] You know,
[06:06] brother fixed this false relation
to make you feel jealous,
[06:10] and your father?
[06:12] He came to play the role of the villain
in the film.
[06:15] Come on, Rania, this is not fair.
[06:17] You know, I have never seen brother
as worried as he is today.
[06:23] If you two behave like this,
[06:26] then brother will really
get engaged to Honey.
[06:28] Although, I have confirmed
that he loves you,
[06:33] Rania and he is doing
all this to get you.
[06:38] He is not even caring
about his ego.
[06:40] And he is apologizing
to everyone and you?
[06:43] You are not even able
to forgive him.
[06:44] You have become so selfish?
[06:47] Rania, you always solve
everyone’s issues,
[06:51] today I am asking you for my brother.
[06:53] Solve my brother’s problem, please.
[07:39] Mahir.
[07:40] Bebo, when did you come?
Who else came with you?
[07:44] No one else came right now.
[07:45] I used the parlour as an excuse
to meet you.
[07:48] And to ask you what you two
are doing with each other?
[07:51] You tell me, what do I do?
[07:52] hey, I have gotten tired asking for
forgiveness but Rania isn’t forgiving me.
[07:56] She feels I am the biggest cheat
and liar of the world.
[08:00] You tell me, what do I do?
[08:01] Mahir, things have gotten out
of Rania’s hands.
[08:04] But no matter what
you have to make her yours.
[08:08] You are a boy,
you should be this strong.
[08:12] You do one thing,
talk to brother Zaman.
[08:15] As soon as Dr. Wasiq’s chapter is closed,
[08:18] we will convince Rania ourselves.
[08:21] Hey, yes. You are right.
[08:24] Thank you Bebo.
[08:25] I really like it that you are with me.
Hey, why not?
[08:28] Only you two look good as a pair.
[08:43] Mahir,
[08:45] Where are you going, son?
[08:46] I am going to do something important dad,
[08:48] pray that I become successful in it.
[08:50] What are you saying? son?
Hey, I won’t pray for you?
[08:53] You are my only son. Only.
[08:56] I love you more than myself,
[08:59] but son, I feel that whatever
is happening with you,
[09:04] I too am responsible for it somewhere.
[09:13] Go.
[09:14] I really love you, dad.
[09:17] But it is the problem of this love,
[09:19] you only find out when
you have hurt your beloved.
[09:24] Go son,
[09:26] I too really love you a lot.
[09:29] in fact, all off are with you.
[09:31] Go win your world.
[09:34] Mahir, where are you going?
[09:35] Hey, you never call someone
from behind.
[09:37] And where he is heading he will never tell you
where he is going, do you understand?
[09:42] Dabeer, aren’t you being
a little too sentimental?
[09:45] I wanted that he takes the car,
[09:47] after all he is my future son in law.
[09:49] There is no need for that,
[09:51] I am fine on my bike. Bye dad.
[09:54] Goodbye son.
[09:59] Go son, in God’s protection.
[10:03] Shall we go inside?
What are you doing standing here?
[10:05] Come. He has left.
[10:12] Uncle, whatever was the truth,
I have told you.
[10:17] It was just a small mischief, that’s it.
[10:20] I admit it was my mistake,
[10:23] that mistake became a punishment
for me as well.
[10:28] But I had no such intention.
[10:31] That’s what happens, son.
[10:33] At times the small mistakes
of life give us big lessons.
[10:44] Uncle you see, see here,
[10:46] I beg you and apologize,
please forgive me.
[10:49] Give Rania’s hand in my hand.
[10:57] I know only you have all the right.
[11:00] Please uncle.
[11:01] Why do you want to embarrass me?
[11:03] You are apologizing and that too
to a sinner like me?
[11:11] See, you are a really good boy,
[11:14] my own blood
but Rania is my daughter,
[11:18] for whom I couldn’t do
anything all my life,
[11:22] and now when there is a chance,
I want to do everything for her.
[11:27] That is why I chose Dr. Wasiq,
[11:29] because he will keep Rania happy.
[11:31] Uncle, what do you think?
[11:33] Wont I be able to keep Rania happy?
[11:35] You are just like Rania,
[11:37] neither she trusts me, nor do you.
[11:40] I trust you son.
I trust you completely.
[11:44] But I don’t trust your
step mother at all.
[11:47] She has enmity with
my daughter for no reason.
[11:50] Hey uncle,
she has nothing to do with me.
[11:53] Aunty Sweetie cannot interfere
in my life.
[11:55] She has already interfered in your life.
[11:59] And sorry to say, but I cannot send
my daughter to such a home,
[12:02] where there will be
a new problem daily.
[12:05] Dr. Wasiq is someone we know,
he has no one but us.
[12:09] We are his family and he is our family,
that is why he will be better.
[12:13] Uncle, you please think about
what I said with a cool mind…
[12:15] I liked seeing your courage.
[12:17] At least, you said this looking in my eyes.
[12:21] I know you will go really far in life.
[12:23] How will I go far uncle?
[12:25] You are snatching my life from me.
[12:27] I am making my daughter’s life.
[12:33] Goodbye.
[13:00] You know, Rania,
[13:03] I don’t like seeing you sad like this.
[13:07] I want to say no to the wedding as well.
[13:11] Don’t you dare.
Don’t even think about it.
[13:15] Poor uncle will drink poison and die.
[13:19] Why poison?
[13:21] Because sleeping pills are
really expensive.
[13:24] Uncle will think when I have to die,
then I will die cheap.
[13:28] It is so wrong, you are so bad.
[13:32] Yes, maybe.
[13:36] Is Mahir calling?
[13:42] Yes.
[13:44] then talk to him.
[13:46] When you have decided
to go your separate ways,
[13:49] then say goodbye to him nicely.
[13:52] Then he will start his life with Honey,
[13:57] and you accept Dr. Wasiq.
[14:00] Maybe this is the end of this story.
[14:07] Pick up the phone.
[14:29] Your dad is even more stubborn
than you, Rania.
[14:31] I tried pleading, begging,
requesting him,
[14:34] but he is not ready to listen to me.
[14:37] He doesn’t see anyone
beyond Dr. Wasiq.
[14:39] If papa has told you his decision,
why did you call me?
[14:43] Look Rania nothing is ruined till now.
[14:46] All my family is standing with me.
[14:49] even Mian Jee and Bebo are with us.
[14:52] Once we get married,
[14:54] everything will be fine,
no one will say anything.
[14:56] Do you understand?
[14:58] What do you want to say?
[15:00] I go against my father’s decision
and marry you?
[15:15] It is true that I don’t want
to marry Dr. Wasiq,
[15:19] it is also true that I like you,
[15:31] still…
[15:33] still I cannot sadden my father.
[15:41] This is a question of our life.
[15:45] Life is something
you cannot trust Mahir,
[15:49] and I will not break my father’s trust
for something that cannot be trusted.
[15:55] no matter the whole family
is standing with us.
[15:58] Don’t be emotional
and decide, Rania.
[16:00] Think with a cool mind.
[16:01] I have always been emotional
[16:04] and emotional people have a
soft heart too.
[16:11] I have seen Mian Jee suffer
because of my papa’s disobedience,
[16:19] I don’t want that my papa stays restless
because of me all his life.
[16:33] You…
[16:36] you get in the relation with Honey.
[16:41] No matter how Aunty Sweetie is,
Honey is not like her.
[16:45] She is a really good girl.
[17:45] Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
[17:48] Nephew, thank God you landed.
[17:52] Come quickly to the event,
come quickly…what?
[17:56] The plane is not flying?
[17:58] The flight got canceled?
[17:59] It is raining in Karachi?
[18:01] What are you saying?
you are not coming to the event?
[18:04] Oh my,
[18:05] what excuse will I make?
Here, talk to Rabail.
[18:08] Rabail, talk to him.
I don’t want to talk to him.
[18:10] Talk to him.
No.
[18:13] She doesn’t want to talk to you.
[18:45] Greetings sister.
[18:48] Greetings Mian Jee.
[18:50] Greetings. Greeting. Listen,
did you hurt your neck, huh?
[18:54] It look stiff.
[18:56] Oh sister,
[18:58] I am really tired of this habit
of joking of yours.
[19:02] After all, I am father of the groom.
[19:06] I need to show this much attitude.
[19:09] Hah, okay then
[19:11] you keep your attitude,
we are seeing the dance.
[19:15] I am also seeing it and doing it.
[21:10] What happened?
Did you get scared?
[21:15] I am not even scared of my father.
[21:19] Music.
[22:48] Stop the drum. Stop it.
[22:52] Where is the DJ? DJ,
[22:55] give me a mic. Give me a mic.
[22:59] Yes. Yes. Is it on?
[23:01] Hello. Hello.
[23:04] Greetings.
[23:07] And I want to say that today,
[23:10] me and my brother Anwaar Ahmed
Siddique have decided
[23:17] that today on this happy occasion,
[23:20] we will make the function even better.
[23:27] Listen. Listen.
[23:29] I want to have my lovely grandson
Mahir’s engagement today,
[23:38] our lovely granddaughter,
my stupid Rania.
[24:52] This is cheating.
[24:53] Mahir’s proposal has been fixed
with my Honey.
[24:56] Where did this Rania come from?
[24:57] Hey, be quiet.
Give me this.
[25:00] Here. Here.
Be quiet,
[25:02] all of you listen to me.
[25:04] These children consider me
their elder and sympathizer,
[25:13] and I too am really their
true sympathizer,
[25:16] so sister and I have decided
for their wedding.
[25:22] Okay?
[25:23] And now everyone has to create
an issue in this decision.
[25:28] What do you understand?
Yes.
[25:30] Rania, child,
[25:32] Mahir truly loves you.
Understand.
[25:37] In the past whatever he did
knowingly and unknowingly,
[25:41] he is embarrassed on it himself,
[25:43] so leave the past behind
and step in the future.
[25:48] Yes, that’s the deal.
[25:58] Yes, the decision that
you have made for Mahir,
[26:00] he will regret it all his life.
[26:02] I will put this home,
this wealth in my name
[26:06] and these useless freeloaders
living in my home
[26:09] I will drag them out. Mr. Zaman,
you too think about it,
[26:12] will you give your daughter
to this poor man?
[26:15] With all due respect, rich people like
you are the poor people,
[26:19] who don’t know the importance of love.
[26:22] It took me a long time to
understand it as well.
[26:28] Aunty Sweetie,
[26:29] before you make the wish
to snatch this home, see this.
[26:32] What is this?
[26:33] This is the accounts for the salary you
didn’t pay uncle Dabeer in the past 20 years.
[26:38] He used to care for your shop
like an employee
[26:40] and you never paid him a salary,
[26:42] and you kept on saying who takes
a salary to care for his own shop?
[26:45] But now I feel that the time is here
and it is necessary.
[26:48] First we will clear the accounts
for the past twenty years
[26:51] and then we will talk about
anything else.
[26:53] Honey, how can you go against me
like this?
[26:56] I feel embarrassed calling you
my life partner.
[27:01] If you want to go to America,
then go.
[27:03] I will stay here in Pakistan
with my Honey.
[27:12] Listen, Sweetie,
you go, leave us alone.
[27:14] Come we will complete the ceremony.
Come on. Come on child. Come.
[27:36] Hello. Hello.
[27:37] Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad Jumman
speaking.
[27:40] Hey, give it to me.
[27:42] Mian Jee…
[27:48] Mahir, son, my prince,
[27:53] your grandfather gave me this ring,
[27:56] now you put this on your wife’s finger,
my son.
[28:01] Live long, you too live long.
My love.
[28:06] Come on, put the ring on her finger.
[28:25] One second. One second.
[28:26] What happened?
[28:28] I want you to promise me something.
[28:31] Promise?
[28:32] Fine, I will fulfill all promises, okay?
[28:35] No, I want you to promise.
[28:38] What promise?
[28:40] Promise me that you will not stop me
to from becoming the prime minister.
[28:43] What? Prime Minister?
[28:45] I accept. I accept. Mahir,
say that you accept it.
[28:48] Accept it. Yes. Yes.
Say it son, say it.
[28:51] Accept it.
Okay fine. Fine. I accept.
[29:26] Wasiq, son,
[29:28] for the sake of my happiness,
she was sacrificing her happiness, so…
[29:32] Papa,.
[29:34] You made the right decision.
[29:38] If the relations of a life time,
[29:41] are made with the heart instead
of the mind, then they last forever.
[29:46] I am happy.
[29:48] This is what I expected from you.
[30:05] Congratulations from me as well.
[30:22] Dabeer, why is everyone staring
at me like this?
[30:26] Everyone is surprised on how
you changed your style suddenly.
[30:32] You know I like joking.
[30:35] Was this you joking?
[30:36] In future will you remain
in your senses?
[30:39] Mama, she was joking, fine,
accept what she said.
[30:42] She was joking.
[30:50] Hey, not this music, that one.
[30:54] Let me have some romantic moment.
[31:21] By the way…
I feel…
[31:27] You did something big making
two lovers meet.
[31:31] You don’t get disheartened,
[31:34] those two were made for each other.
