[02:39] you can’t even get a pack
of chips for 50 rupees.
[02:43] maybe not a pack of chips
[02:45] but 50 rupees is enough
for this petrol.
[02:47] you see illegal stuff can’t be
sold at legal prices
[02:52] if you say we can just call
the cops and ask them
[02:54] oh no child there’s no need
to call the cops
[02:58] I was just kidding
[03:00] oh really?
[03:01] I didn’t know we had
that kind of relationship
[03:04] why didn’t you tell me before
[03:05] oh don’t be funny do u want me
to fill up the tank?
[03:08] No just take these 50 rupees and
put some fuel in so I can get home.
[03:11] Okay, okay
[03:15] Oh,
[03:16] look at those hot patties,
[03:22] why do I never have enough money?
[03:25] I am not that broke

[03:30] Brother give me a patty a hot one,
how much is it.
[03:33] Oh,

[03:38] Oh really? The shop is mine?
[03:42] Mine or yours it’s all the same
[03:44] Of course.
[03:47] Hey kids over here,
[03:50] come here yes come come
[03:53] So kids this shop is mine
for the day
[03:57] and I happen to be
in a very good mood
[03:59] so you guys eat all you want.
[04:01] (Kids yelling)
[04:03] Oh, madam don’t do this. oh,

[04:08] He took it away;
[04:10] madam, please stop them

[04:15] You don’t know
[04:17] who you messed up well

[04:19] gotta tell you father you signed
the shop off to me.
[04:24] Please madam no please forgive me
[04:27] I swear on my life no I swear
on my father’s life
[04:32] I will never catcall again I’ll never
even look at you again
[04:35] but please don’t tell my father
[04:37] Should've thought of that before
you decided to catcall me?
[04:40] The future prime minister of the country.
[04:43] Son, wait till I get into the office
I’ll announce capital punishment for people like you.
[04:51] Madam, I have made mistake.
[05:05] Hey, you!
[05:07] What are you doing sitting here
didn’t I ask you to get groceries.
[05:11] I called brother he straight up
refused to give me money.
[05:15] Refused? Why?
Where is he?
[05:18] There he is.
[05:52] Listen here!
Why did you refuse him money?
[05:54] First of all,
tell me one thing grandma
[05:57] who made this grocery list.
[05:59] I did
[06:01] Grandma why so many groceries?
[06:02] Seems like we are responsible
for the entire town’s supply
[06:06] You got to do what you got to do,
[06:09] this new area is weird people here
don’t socialize with one another.
[06:15] So, in order to get with these people,
you have to be smart
[06:19] now you see the general store here
[06:22] we are going to buy so many groceries
[06:25] that the shopkeeper will get confused
[06:27] I asked Shenshah to tell
the man at the store
[06:30] that all this is going the family of royals.
[06:33] I wish this was really the family of royals.
[06:35] It’s the same lie you people told my family
to lure me into this family
[06:39] Listen to me
There was no allurement
[06:42] my great-grandfather’s name
was nawab
[06:44] and so was his attitude
[06:47] Wow! Everyone is so obsessed
with themselves in this house
[06:51] no one cares about me
[06:53] Look,
[06:55] my dear uncle here is so lazy
[06:58] that if he gets up to do anything
he can’t keep his breath
[07:01] and his laziness is the reason
why I am responsible for his whole family
[07:05] And hey look at her
my aunt’s daughter Rabail!
[07:08] She’s resting in peace while
I take care of her responsibilities.
[07:14] I have no life!
[07:15] I have worked so hard to build everything
I have but what’s the point?
[07:19] This bodybuilder here eats
everything what do I do
[07:23] look at him, Shenshah,
[07:25] feels like he employs us and not him.
[07:28] My poor dad,
[07:29] he used to send so many dollars
[07:31] but now he sends so little like
something in the camel’s mouth…
[07:37] Rice?
[07:37] No, no biryani, nothing else
[07:39] Something fragrant as far as I can remember
[07:43] Rose?
[07:46] Cumin?
[07:47] Yes cumin!
[07:48] Send as many dollars
 as cumin in a camel’s mouth
[07:51] Cumin in the camel’s mouth is very strange
[07:54] Which reminds me of curry
[07:57] cumin’s added in that too.
[07:58] We can whip some curry up
that’s not a big deal.
[08:02] Make some naan too
[08:05] Also, curry doesn’t have cumin in it
[08:07] you can look it up
on YouTube if you want
[08:10] It does actually
[08:12] I’ll go see my mother’s old recipes
[08:28] greetings
[08:30] how nice look everyone came
today everything okay?
[08:33] greetings
please
[08:38] I have come here with
a very important matter
[08:41] my family’s name is being disrespected
because of this woman
[08:49] and my son just won’t listen to me
[08:52] no so Mr. Charlie can you please
shed some light on the matter
[08:56] my wife has labelled my daughter in law
unfortunate for not having a son
[09:01] see now that’s not good
[09:02] exactly.
[09:04] Auntie how do you know your son
isn’t the one who’s unfortunate
[09:07] Why did you even marry her
If you couldn’t protect her?
[09:09] I don’t know anything I want to
get my son married again
[09:12] but this idiot is all under
his wife’s spell
[09:17] what if the second wife didn’t
give him a son? then?
[09:19] that logic has weight
[09:23] what if the second one didn’t
give you a son too?
[09:25] we’ll only find that out if he
agrees to get married again
[09:29] so, it means ruining the lives
of two different women.
[09:34] my son is reaching 30
[09:38] and when he gets old who will take care
of all of our land and properties?
[09:43] Enemies are looking for a chance
they’ll just take it all.
[09:47] right
[09:49] so I think
[09:52] instead of trying something new
[09:53] why don’t we try the old method
that’s been proven successful
[09:59] see auntie’s son isn’t ready to remarry
[10:02] so why don’t we get auntie’s
husband married again.
[10:10] Long live Rania. Long live!
[10:14] so, it’s settled
[10:15] then I’ll get married again let’s go
[10:18] Okay
[10:20] I’ll never let that happen,
[10:23] rivers of blood will
flow through the streets
[10:25] let it flow but at least there’ll be
an heir to look after our legacy.
[10:31] I am so grateful to you ma’am
my heart is soothed.
[10:36] Let’s go father I’ll find you a beautiful bride
let’s go I’ll find the matchmaker
[10:52] Mian sahab, I am telling you this granddaughter
of yours is evil.
[10:57] You need to put a leash on
her she’s ruining my life.
[11:08] look at her squirming. What about when
she was doing the same to her daughter in law.
[11:13] Mian Sahab I am telling you really need to control her
[11:18] the entire village will know everything
that woman said about her
[11:21] Troublemaker and cunning
[11:24] Rani I am warning you keep
your tongue in control or else…
[11:29] I will kill you!
[11:31] oh wait
[11:40] child your mother has a fragile heart
[11:43] she gets scared
[11:45] but I am very proud of you
[11:48] you always say the right thing.
[11:52] Give some of this confidence
to your mother as well.
[11:56] Sure Mian Sahab
[12:00] 160
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:16,639
brother Kamal here’s you 5 thousand
[12:17] 5 thousand?
[12:18] we talked about three rounds, right?
[12:19] But we brought all the trucks in
one round hence it’s 5000
[12:25] but you brought only three trucks
[12:27] that’s because…
[12:28] why are you staring
at me like a gangster
[12:30] yes, I am a gangster
[12:31] why are you walking around with gangsters
I thought you were a decent man.
[12:35] Hey dude do you have some
extra money on you?
[12:37] no
[12:38] in situations like these your
own friends become strangers
[12:41] Why don’t you come over on Sunday
now!
[12:43] Let’s go
easy man it’s my house
[12:52] mama you in the kitchen?
[12:54] Means you cooked?
[12:56] yes, son you care for me too much
[12:59] but in this new place
I’ll have to take care of cooking
[13:02] and cleaning till we find a maid
[13:05] what have you made?
[13:06] Eggplant curry
[13:11] how will we eat this?
[13:13] I don’t know
[13:14] everything’s all set up
[13:18] Hopefully this new area
will be good for us.
[13:20] Actually, I think why don’t you invite
the ladies from the neighbourhood
[13:24] and have a little kitty party for them
something nice on Sunday
[13:29] and we’ll do some socializing too.
[13:31] you’re always worried
about yourself
[13:33] Korean recipe I assume?
For the new neighbourhood
[13:41] I made eggplant curry
[13:42] eggplant curry?
[13:47] Our swimming pool has
less water in it than this.
[13:50] what did you say?
[13:51] I mean it looks very good
[13:55] Laiba set the table we’ll
all eat together
[14:00] oh, but I am observing a fast
for the new house
[14:02] I’ll break it at sunset
[14:06] fast?
[14:08] I am on a diet can’t take
up too many calories
[14:12] I had a big breakfast
I am not hungry at all
[14:19] I did so much work for what?
[14:22] What delicious food I cooked,
it’ll all go to waste now.
[14:46] ugh
[14:47] For god’s sake
[14:50] you two are still playing?
When will you do your homework.
[14:53] There’s a test tomorrow.
[14:55] And you? I told you to get off
the bed two hours ago
[14:59] Tell me something Hammad did you
take an oath in your childhood
[15:02] that you’ll be lazy forever.
[15:04] what’s wrong?
[15:06] why do you have so many issues
with my content life.
[15:11] because your happy life has made
mine horrible
[15:18] I live like a widow and your kids
orphans even though you’re alive
[15:23] that’s your issue.
[15:25] You think too negatively and
it reflects in your life.
[15:29] what about all that generational wealth
and riches your mother promised?
[15:35] where is it?
[15:36] Why are living like this looking to
your rude nephew and his American father?
[15:43] After brother Dabeer left
who was going to take care of it all?
[15:47] We sold half
[15:49] and the rest was taken away from us
[15:51] but not all of it is gone my lion of nephew
Mahir is taking good care of what’s left
[15:56] and you? What’s your purpose?
[15:59] You know what today I feel like going
to a five-star restaurant
[16:02] and ordering a nice & expensive meal
[16:04] we’ll go too, us too
[16:06] how will we go?
There’s nothing in our pockets.
[16:10] that is true
[16:11] and to top it all off my mother called
[16:13] she told me Mona’s planning on coming
[16:16] how was I supposed to tell her
[16:18] that we are living in this house like
second class citizens already
[16:21] my poor sister doesn’t know
what she’s getting into
[16:23] that is also true
[16:26] I don’t know why I am even
playing flute to this buffalo.
[16:31] wait
[16:32] do you have money?
Are we going?
[16:34] No, I was saying can you maybe
pick my phone up from there?
[16:39] pick it up yourself,
[16:41] bending a little won’t
fracture your spine.
[16:48] what a strange woman.
[16:51] useless man
[16:55] hello dad, how are you.
[16:57] what is this dad?
Don’t call me that
[17:01] It reminds me of those
shameless American dad
[17:07] Call me “Abba ji” “baba Jani”
[17:13] Saying that makes you
feel very respectable.
[17:17] You understand?
You little centipede
[17:19] do you know when I mention my dad
in conversation with my friends
[17:23] they are filled with respect
[17:27] and anyway “abba” “baba” are
very local terms here.
[17:32] ”Dad” makes you feel imported.
[17:35] You are one stubborn son.
[17:38] do whatever you want
[17:41] I can’t live here so far
and still use the old ways
[17:47] there’s a different sense
to Pakistani fathers
[17:54] Sometimes I just feel like getting on
a train and coming to Pakistan
[17:59] and disciplining all the kids
the traditional way.
[18:07] hey hey what are you saying?
[18:09] consider we’ve sent you off
to America for good.
[18:13] Your only home is in America
now stay there!
[18:17] what are you even saying son?
[18:20] I am right.
[18:22] Do you know what I’ve told
my friends?
[18:24] I told them my father is a big
American businessman
[18:28] and his personality?
[18:29] He doesn’t even look like my father
he looks like my brother.
[18:32] And look at you dad,
[18:35] you don’t even look like my dad
you like dad’s dad.
[18:39] What have you done to yourself?
[18:41] America did this to me,
swallowed my youth
[18:47] Your luxurious life back home
came at a cost.
[18:56] I have lived off of spearmint sauce
[18:59] and loaves of bread
[19:02] and sometimes
when the bread would go stiff
[19:05] then I would dip it in water to make it
bearable I have worked so hard
[19:10] while you lot are having the time
of your life over there
[19:12] Do you know what happened once?
Let me tell you a story son
[19:15] Dad, dad, dad,
I think I should go
[19:18] and you should eat some spearmint
sauce doctors say it’s good for health.
[19:22] You go rest and I’ll do the same
[19:23] Talk later ok bye bye bye.
[19:25] huh,
[19:26] my coffee went cold
because of this idiot.
[19:32] Oh no it’s still hot
[19:36] Dabeer did you set
the table for dinner?
[19:38] yes yes ma’am I am about to,
I was just doing the dishes.
[19:44] why does he get so emotional
for no reason every time
[19:46] Little does he know
how hard my life is,
[19:50] the entire family’s responsibility
is on my shoulder,
[19:54] and look at him,
having a blast in America.
[19:59] Here I thought I’d get a new car
[20:01] I even told all my friends
[20:05] God knows how I’ll face them now
[20:27] I saw you at the rooftop yesterday.
[20:30] Since then I am thinking
whether you are prettier or…
[20:34] Or the sparkling moon on the sky.
[20:38] I am unable to decide.
[20:40] You tell.
[20:42] Why are you saying so?
He didn’t curse me.
[20:47] He just asked an innocent question.
[20:50] Hmm.
[20:52] Men your age must be married,
[20:56] with at least two to three children.
[20:59] A boy can’t say these foolish
things to you.
[21:02] That means I should keep an eye
over all the married men near me.
[21:09] You are right, Rania.
[21:11] He must be someone disloyal
and bored from his wife.
[21:16] Such men should be cursed
thousand times.
[21:18] Don’t worry.
[21:19] Just let me come into
power just once.
[21:23] I will make such a law for such lustful men.
They are not ashamed at all.
[21:26] Well, reply him.
[21:27] Reply to him in such a way
that teaches him a lesson.
[21:30] No, no, Rania.
I will not. Leave it.
[21:33] Let it go.
[21:34] Hey, why won’t you?
[21:36] Your niece will not stay silent.
[21:39] Hey, Rania.
Are you out of your mind?
[21:42] Will you defame me
in the neighbourhood?
[21:44] Leave it.
[21:45] Why should I leave it?
[21:46] I should know who he is.
[21:49] I will text him for sure.
I will not spare him.
[21:54] You say such cute things, right?
[21:56] You will be cute by face
as well for sure.
[22:00] Show me your face, please.
[22:05] You see. He will not be spared.
[22:07] Did he reply?
Yes.
[22:09] He is saying that I cannot glow
in front of your face, Asma.
[22:16] I swear, you are unique.
[22:20] I swear?
[22:21] Whose catch word is this?
[22:24] Got him.
[22:26] I had a correct idea.
He is a lustful oldie.
[22:29] I will go show these messages
to his wife tomorrow.
[22:31] Then he will get to know
how unique we are.
[22:34] You know him?
[22:35] Tell me too. Who is he?
[22:37] Tomorrow, the house that will echo
with the voices of a man screaming,
[22:40] be assured that he lives
in that house.
[22:43] I will also take some
battler women with me.
[22:46] He will not be spared.
[22:48] Is he married?
[22:49] Yes.
[22:51] Does he have children too?
Yes.
[22:53] And not just two. He has five.
[22:57] And he is flirting with
an unmarried girl like me.
[23:01] Now don’t say that you will hit him
when you will become a PM.
[23:05] Because such a scoundrel
should be hit right now.
[23:09] He made fun of my feelings.
[23:13] He made my Bebo cry, right?
[23:15] I will not spare him.
[23:19] Hey?
Who is she?
[23:21] For God’s sake.
At least listen to me.
[23:23] Shameless man.
For God’s sake. Listen to me.
[23:29] Hey? Hey?
Hey, oldie.
[23:31] Take this. Hit him with this.
Beat him with this. Beat him more.
[23:34] To hell with you.
Shameless scoundrel.
[23:37] Take this. Beat him with this too.
[23:38] Take this.
Come out.
[23:40] Shano, save me.
[23:41] Will she save you?
She will save you?
[23:43] Come out.
Hey? Hey, hey?
[23:46] I swear I am not that kind of a boy.
[23:48] Boy?
[23:49] I have not sent any such texts to anyone.
[23:50] If you don’t believe then ask my Shano.
[23:52] You are being treated right.
[23:54] Really?
[23:55] Whose number is this?
[23:56] Yes? Look at this, aunt.
[23:57] Have a look. What cheap texts
he has sent to our child.
[24:00] Child?
[24:01] Is she a child?
[24:02] Hey, will I call her a moon?
Am I blind?
[24:06] Hey, if I’d have to call someone a moon,
I’d say that to my Shano.
[24:08] Who even looks like a moon.
[24:10] Lustful oldie,
you are being treated right.
[24:12] Hit him.
[24:13] Hey, hey? One minute.
One minute.
[24:15] Listen to me.
I got it. It is not my mistake.
[24:18] It’s my son’s mistake.
[24:19] It’s… It’s…
It’s…
[24:21] Hey?
[24:22] You tell me.
You are sitting silent.
[24:25] Tell me honestly.
[24:26] I am being beaten up because of you.
[24:28] You have done it, right?
[24:30] You sent this sms, right?
Tell me?
[24:32] Father, you have the cell phone all the time,
and now you are blaming me.
[24:35] I am a child, not a fool.
[24:37] Shut up. Hey?
You argue with your father?
[24:39] Shano, are you watching him?
[24:41] Hey, your actions are as such.
You must have sent those texts.
[24:43] Beat him. Beat him more.
[24:45] Hey, hey? One minute.
One minute.
[24:47] Forgive me, forgive me.
[24:49] I agree, it’s my mistake.
[24:50] But after today,
[24:52] I will never send any text to any girl.
[24:54] I repent. Forgive me.
Forgive me.
[24:56] Next time,
[24:57] if you flirt with any other girl
apart from your wife,
[25:01] then I will bring the police next time.
[25:04] I will get you arrested.
Get it?
[25:06] I apologize.
Make some parathas for them.
[25:08] Let’s go, aunt.
Enough for today.
[25:14] You people don’t know your friend.
[25:16] Hey, we are rich from generations.
[25:19] My father is in the US.
[25:21] Where in the US?
Changa Manga.
[25:24] I am talking. Keep quiet.
[25:26] Dude, make less noise.
[25:28] Yes, so what was I saying?
[25:30] Hey, no, dude. Yes.
Where in the US?
[25:33] Hey, ask me how many places
does he live at?
[25:35] Hey, he is such a big businessman.
He doesn’t have just one place to stay.
[25:38] Yes. Well, listen?
[25:40] I have decided.
[25:41] I will come to Dilawar Shah’s
wedding by myself.
[25:44] And I will give him such a gift
that people will see.
[25:47] Yes. Okay. Bye.
[25:51] Grandmother, tell me one thing.
[25:53] I have to give such a gift to a friend’s
wedding that it elevates my respect.
[25:57] What should I give?
Then gift him this house.
[25:59] What about us?
We will live on the trees.
[26:02] Just like your husband, you have
said such a cheap thing, aunt.
[26:05] Grandmother, you tell me.
[26:07] Hey, just give him 10 or 15 thousand
as a wedding gift.
[26:09] It will work as a showoff too.
[26:11] Hey, the thing you said about the gift,
[26:15] you know your father has not send us
any money this month, right?
[26:18] With the house rents,
we will barely survive.
[26:21] Grandmother, don’t take tension.
I am here, right?
[26:24] Show me this ring.
[26:26] Oho, grandmother.
What a design!
[26:29] Is it gold’s?
[26:30] Yes, yes. All my rings are gold’s
with diamonds on it.
[26:34] Grandmother, it should weigh
at least one tola, right?
[26:37] Yes, yes.
Do remind me.
[26:39] When Saman’s father-in-law would come,
I will show off my rings in front of him too.
[26:42] Yes, yes. Wear it now.
[26:44] Hmm.
[26:45] What do you mean?
Why did you put in your pocket?
[26:48] Hey, grandmother.
The problem is solved.
[26:51] This ring, right?
I will give this ring.
[26:54] Are you not ashamed?
[26:55] Yes? Are you keeping an eye
on your grandmother’s jewellery?
[26:57] You, thief! Take it out.
[26:59] Hey, grandmother. This ring is nothing
in front of our respect and glory.
[27:03] People even give their lives
for the sake of their respect.
[27:06] This is just a ring.
[27:07] And I am not asking for it forever.
[27:10] When I will get some money,
I will give you even heavier than this one.
[27:13] You have made such promises to her
a hundred times earlier as well.
[27:15] Mother?
Do you remember?
[27:17] The necklace made from real stones
that I used to like a lot too…
[27:20] After that, the jewellery box made
from elephant teeth…
[27:22] And after that…
Well, that’s enough.
[27:24] I have not kept anything.
Hey, I will return.
[27:27] But not now.
[27:29] When I will have money, then.
[27:31] He’s right.
[27:32] We have to do everything
for our respect.
[27:35] Exactly.
[27:36] By the way, son.
Tell me one thing.
[27:38] For how long should I be hopeful
that my loss will be recovered?
[27:45] Grandmother,
that I can’t tell you now.
[27:47] But very soon.
Very soon.
[27:49] Okay, I am going, grandmother.
Okay, okay.
[27:51] Respect, and glory.
[27:54] All of that is only for the grandson
and his grandmother.
[27:55] We don’t have any respect.
[27:57] I have not sent your husband
to make a monkey dance, right?
[28:02] She just talks and nothing else.
She knows nothing else.
[28:09] Lift it.
[28:11] What happened?
Are you tired?
[28:13] Yes?
[28:20] Hey?
Stop, stop, stop.
[28:22] Where?
[28:26] I have stopped.
[28:28] Get off, carefully.
[28:30] Good.
Javed?
[28:31] In the name of Allah.
Greeting, mister.
[28:35] How are you, mister?
[28:36] What did I tell you? I told you
that your son Abdullah,
[28:40] Yes, yes.
[28:40] I shouldn’t see him working here
during school timings.
[28:43] Yes, actually the inflation is so high.
[28:45] I also like my son to study.
[28:47] It’s the inflation, don’t I know?
[28:49] Send him there during the school timings,
I have even talked to the headmaster.
[28:54] Mother asked me to bring tomatoes,
shall I go buy them?
[28:58] I will obey your order, sir.
[29:00] Sister?
[29:01] Such a nice suit!
From where did you buy it?
[29:05] I went to Lahore city.
I brought it from there.
[29:08] It costs Rupees eight thousand.
[29:10] I bought five suits like these.
[29:13] Hey, all your veggies are stale.
[29:17] How much for a kg potato?
[29:20] Sister, they are for sixty a kg.
[29:22] Sixty rupees?
[29:25] I will pay only forty rupees.
[29:27] Sister, fear God.
[29:30] Even I don’t buy for forty rupees.
[29:32] I said forty, then I will only pay forty.
[29:35] One minute. One minute. Aunt?
[29:38] You can buy clothes for
six to seven thousand.
[29:41] But you can’t pay this poor man
the right price for his veggies?
[29:43] Here you go. She is here too.
[29:45] A welfare worker.
[29:47] How are you related to this
that you are interfering?
[29:51] I am just saying that
he is a poor man.
[29:53] If he will earn from here,
he will feed his children two times.
[29:57] And besides, he is coming to
our neighbourhood for so many years.
[30:00] We all know that
he is such an honest man.
[30:02] Why do you bother him?
[30:04] Hunh!
[30:06] May God bless,
may God bless.
[30:08] May God keep you safe.
[30:10] Your granddaughter is an angel.
[30:18] Life of a cartoon is so pretty.
[30:21] I envy seeing their lives.
[30:24] Father, have some shame.
[30:26] A child is sitting here.
What are you saying?
[30:27] You are envying what…
My luck!
[30:30] Greetings!
[30:31] Mother is here.
[30:34] Have a seat, grandmother.
[30:37] Mother, shall I bring you water?
[30:38] No, child.
He fed me juice on our way.
[30:43] Wow. Wow. Wow.
[30:45] This huge shopping?
What have you brought?
[30:48] Hey, aunt.
We bought the whole mall.
[30:51] Show it.
[30:53] Yes, yes. Showing it.
Have some patience.
[30:55] Where should I start?
[30:57] Yes, I should start from a shirt.
Check this, uncle.
[31:00] See this, see this,
see this.
[31:01] What a print!
What a cloth!
[31:04] Hey, wow!
Whose is it for?
[31:06] What do you mean whose?
It’s mine.
[31:09] It will look so good
when I will wear it, dude.
[31:11] Uncle, look at this.
[31:14] Camel colour.
[31:16] And this colour is so inn these days.
[31:18] Show more.
[31:20] Hey, have some patience.
I am taking it out.
[31:22] Where has it gone?
Here it is.
[31:24] This shawl is for my pretty grandmother.
[31:26] And here is the bedsheet for her bed.
[31:29] I forbade him but he insisted
to buy these for me.
[31:34] Hey?
[31:35] How did I forget?
[31:37] Here. Here it is, uncle.
[31:39] See how fit this pant is.
[31:42] You will see when I will wear it.
[31:44] That’s for you too?
Yes.
[31:47] You didn’t buy anything for us?
[31:49] Aunt, so you said it like strangers, right?
[31:51] Hey, what is this ‘yours and mine’?
[31:53] We live in one house as a family.
[31:55] Hey, whether I wear these clothes,
you wear them, or Rabail.
[31:57] What difference would it make?
[31:58] When I will wear it, then of course
we all will be respected, right?
[32:06] Hey, what…?
Did I say anything wrong?
[32:09] Hammad?
[32:10] Your wife is such an envious person.
[32:13] She was hurt the most for my shawl
and my stuff.
[32:17] Tell him.
[32:18] She knows the royal anger, right?
[32:20] Look there. Look,
my granddaughter is sitting there.
[32:22] She is happy, right?
She was not jealous.
[32:25] Grandmother is absolutely right, uncle.
[32:27] Grandmother, this world is like this.
[32:30] Everyone is selfish.
[32:31] Hey? No, no.
Your aunt is not selfish.
[32:33] She is a bit sick.
That’s why she was angry.
[32:36] She is so happy seeing all of this.
[32:39] Very good.
The cartoon is nice too.
[32:41] Hey?
Look at this.
[32:43] Uncle, check this.
[32:55] Who is coming in such a big car?
[32:57] Sister? Sister has come.
[33:00] Sister?
[33:03] Hey, bring the sweets.
[33:04] Hey, I am amazed.
[33:06] This beggar Rafique bought
a new shining car?
[33:09] I am jealous.
[33:11] Greetings, grandmother.
Live long, live long.
[33:14] Love you, love you.
[33:17] My dearest is here.
[33:21] Greetings, sister.
Greetings.
[33:24] How are you?
Thanks to God. You say?
[33:27] Wow, you have brought
a new shining car, right?
[33:32] Saman?
[33:34] Tell your grandmother that
we have brought sweets for her.
[33:38] Here you go.
[33:40] We have brought sweets made
with ghee weighing 10 kgs.
[33:44] As we bought a new car.
[33:46] Yes, that I can see.
[33:48] But you should have hired a driver too.
[33:52] Why so, grandmother?
[33:54] Because you see, your personality…
[33:57] It doesn’t suit you driving this car.
[34:00] So on the front seat,
[34:03] there should a person in the uniform
driving this car.
[34:06] So this way people will know that the person
sitting behind is the owner of this car.
[34:11] By the way, I came here
in such a good mood.
[34:14] So I didn’t tell your family background
in front of the children either.
[34:18] You wore such a nice
white suit today.
[34:21] Seems like a black crow
is wearing it.
[34:27] Mother, talk to me too.
I have come for you.
[34:31] Greetings.
Greetings, son.
[34:34] Saman, child.
[34:36] Tell your grandmother
about the car.
[34:38] It is such an amazing car,
honestly.
[34:41] Very nice!
[34:42] By the way, mother.
Without selling our old house,
[34:48] we are buying a new house.
[34:50] You sold your old house
and bought this bungalow.
[34:56] Material invested here is not good.
[34:58] I would say one should never
buy a readymade house.
[35:02] Listen to me.
[35:03] There was not a single labour
in our last seven generations.
[35:07] How would we know whether
the material is cheap or whatever.
[35:12] We forgot.
I should have called you.
[35:14] Right, son Hammad?
[35:16] Brother, congratulations
for the new car.
[35:19] Thanks, thanks.
Thank you very much.
[35:22] By the way, Hammad.
Tell me one thing.
[35:25] Are you on job somewhere
or are you still high on the royalty?
[35:31] Hey, listen to me.
Why does he need to do odd jobs?
[35:35] His brother is sitting in the US.
[35:37] He showers dollars.
[35:40] He doesn’t have any load.
You will see the dinner table.
[35:45] We have five dishes to eat.
[35:48] And after dinner,
we will have teas of five kinds.
[35:52] But today, our chef is on leave so
we just have potato meat curry for today.
[35:57] Do eat it before you leave.
[35:59] Potato meat curry?
[36:03] Potato meat curry?
[36:08] Mother, you didn’t treat
my father-in-law well.
[36:11] He respects you so much.
You disrespected him.
[36:14] Oho, you don’t worry, okay?
[36:17] He is used to getting
ridiculed from me.
[36:19] Do you what the real thing is?
[36:22] His father was your
grandfather’s employees.
[36:27] Your grandfather used to
have warehouses in the city.
[36:30] He used to work there.
[36:31] Then why didn’t you get me married
to people equal to us?
[36:34] Hey, daughter.
[36:35] It’s better to have son-in-law
from a lower family.
[36:38] I didn’t know that
they will compete me.
[36:42] Now see, to make me jealous,
he brought a new car.
[36:46] Maheer, listen to me.
[36:48] Next week,
[36:49] Saman, Rafique,
and his son are coming.
[36:52] So before they come,
[36:55] bring a new car and
park it in our veranda.
[37:00] Don’t act in front of me
like you are petrified.
[37:02] I am jealous.
[37:05] Grandmother, be mindful a bit.
We just bought this huge house.
[37:09] How will he bring the car?
[37:10] Did you hear what did he say
about the house?
[37:13] Son of a labour!
[37:15] He said that the material
used is cheap.
[37:17] Yes? Maheer, son.
[37:19] Do one thing.
[37:20] Find an experienced worker,
call him, and show him this house.
[37:25] And ask him whether
the material is right or not.
[37:26] My heart is pounding.
[37:28] Grandmother,
what is wrong with you?
[37:30] Why are you thinking about that?
[37:31] Hey, our house is superb.
[37:33] Strong and beautiful.
[37:35] Hey, they are jealous from us.
[37:36] They are saying so out of jealousy.
[37:39] They can’t digest our success.
[37:41] Ignore them.
Really? Is this so?
[37:43] Then prepare to make them
more jealous.
[37:46] That’s it. Bring a nice car.
[37:49] You tell, Saman.
[37:50] Is Rafique Ahmed and
his son treating you well?
[37:54] Well, well.
They are very fine with me.
[37:56] Okay. Hey,
[37:58] it’s time for me to pray.
I am going.
[38:00] Maheer, do remember.
[38:03] You need to bring the car.
I don’t know how!
[38:07] It’s about grandmother’s honour now.
[38:11] We will have to buy the car.
[38:13] I am going to Dilawar Shah’s wedding.
[38:16] I will see after coming back from there.
[38:18] I will buy a little Prado or something.
[38:19] Prado is big, right?
[38:21] Yes, but it’s little for us, right?
[38:24] How many dollars would it require?
[38:26] I am telling you.
[38:27] Don’t you dare go to that mechanic.
[38:31] Why can’t I go?
[38:32] I don’t have legs or I don’t know
how to sit in a bus?
[38:35] Because you are a girl.
[38:37] Girls are human too, mother.
[38:38] And every mature person should
do his/her job themselves.
[38:42] It’s been so many days
[38:43] that mechanic has taken my bike
to fix it to his village.
[38:46] Now he doesn’t even pick my call,
nor return my bike to me.
[38:49] I will fix him by going
to his village.
[38:51] Father, do you know?
[38:52] He must be taking a ride on my bike
with his family every day.
[38:57] Yes, I think his intentions are not good.
[38:59] That is why he is not returning your bike.
[39:01] To hell with him.
[39:03] Let him come tomorrow.
I will bring my bike back myself.
[39:07] Hey, hey? You will go only
when I will allow you to go.
[39:11] I will break your legs.
[39:13] Era has changed.
[39:15] The trust we used to give our sons,
[39:18] we have to give the same
to our daughters now.
[39:20] Even I can go with her
[39:22] but I am not because she can handle
these petty issues herself.
[39:25] But what will people say?
[39:27] Hey, we have made our daughters
weak just out of the fear what will people say.
[39:32] They can say
whatever they want to.
[39:34] Yes, she will go there herself.
[39:36] I will not do this.
[39:37] She will go deal with that
mechanic herself.
[39:40] Yes? Right?
Yes, father.
[39:42] You will see what I will do
to that mechanic.
[40:41] Oh, uncle?
[40:42] Don’t you feed your horse?
[40:44] He is not running at all.
[40:46] I swear I would have reached there
on foot earlier than this.
[40:49] That’s the limit.
[40:51] Those kids…
Even kids are ahead of us.
[40:52] At least speed us now.
[40:54] Oh, child.
You can go on foot.
[40:57] I will take my horse back
to my village.
[41:00] Hey, uncle?
[41:02] Why do you take everything
to your heart?
[41:03] I want to become the prime minister.
[41:05] As soon as I become a PM,
I will gift you a CNG auto.
[41:08] Just make me reach there fast, okay?
[41:09] Auto? Promise?
[41:11] Promise by God.
[41:12] Now you will see my horse’s speed.
[41:15] Let’s go.
Now we are talking.
[41:53] Here I go.
[41:55] Yes, how much?
[41:57] Rupees 150.
[41:58] They are 150.
[42:01] Hey, Mukhtar?
Serve tea.
[42:03] Hey, why is this shop closed?
[42:05] Brother, listen? Is there a funeral
to Sheday’s house?
[42:08] What are you saying?
[42:10] It is not necessary to close the shop
only at a funeral.
[42:13] It can be closed for
a happy moment too.
[42:14] Actually, Sheda got a duty
at the Malik house.
[42:18] Today is their daughter’s wedding.
[42:20] He is sitting at the generator.
[42:22] You already know the load shedding
schedule here.
[42:25] Yes, that’s true.
[42:26] I will solve this problem first
as soon as I become the PM.
[42:30] Prime minister…
[42:32] Well, tell me.
Where is the Malik house?
[42:33] Just go straight.
You will find yourself.
[42:37] Okay.
[42:38] By the way, if you say,
shall I drop you at my bike?
[42:42] Why?
Are you my aunt’s son?
[42:44] Get lost. They just get free
if I talk to them once.
[42:49] Prime minister…
[43:47] Aunt?
[43:48] Hey, we are about to win, wait.
[43:51] Aunt? Have you seen
the Sheda mechanic?
[43:56] Did you think of a mechanic
after seeing me?
[43:58] I have engineers in my neighbourhood.
[43:59] My standard is high
since I was young, girl.
[44:02] Did you get it?
[44:07] By the way,
[44:08] are you from the bride’s side?
Come let’s have a dance competition.
[44:13] I don’t know how to dance.
[44:14] So you are afraid, right?
