[00:25] What happened?
[00:26] Why are you so angry.
You were fine a minute ago.
[00:29] I have decided!
[00:31] and I am certain that I will study law
and be a lawyer.
[00:37] well, okay that's great.
why are you so angry?
[00:43] I am angry because of another thing.
[00:45] I was being polite because I thought
that person was born sad.
[00:49] but no, that man deserves
no politeness.
[00:55] Who? What are you talking about?
[00:57] There’s a limit to being self-obsessed.
[00:59] I swear I am not going
to be discreet now
[01:07] I am going to my room.
No, wait, why?
[01:10] Stay, we’ll hang out,
watch TV and eat snacks.
[01:13] The circumstances are no longer
suitable for hanging out.
[01:17] I am going.
[01:24] what did you say to her?
what?
[01:27] Why would I say anything to her?
[01:29] I don't have the time to engage
with stupid people.
[01:33] and that one isn't just stupid,
she's also insane
[01:36] what has gotten into you brother?
She's a very nice girl; don’t say that.
[01:40] only you think that.
[01:42] you have offended the poor thing.
[02:24] you were right,
[02:26] No one respects you in this house
[02:29] and now you have proof
[02:32] this house is run by Ammaji
and Mahir only
[02:36] Every decision is made
by those two
[02:37] Yeah, that’s plausible,
but what has happened to Mahir?
[02:40] He has become even more cold
and apathetic than the last time.
[02:44] he used to be so frank with me
when I first came here
[02:49] but now, he doesn't even
properly talk to me
[02:52] His face gets so expressionless
when he sees me
[02:56] that is not his fault
[02:58] it’s all that Rania’s doing
[03:00] she’s has got him under her hands
[03:02] yeah, I don’t like her
[03:03] that is why I have called you here
[03:06] so you can take control of Mahir
as soon as possible
[03:08] our lives will get so much better
once that happens
[03:11] What do I do?
[03:12] I keep trying, but he doesn't
even look at me?
[03:16] don't lose hope.
[03:17] If that doesn't work,
[03:21] then I have other ways of
getting what I want.
[03:24] I have made up my mind;
[03:26] I'll get you married to Mahir.
the only girl Mahir will ever marry is you.
[03:39] Doctor
yes?
[03:41] my throat hurts really bad and
this medicine doesn't work at all
[03:47] please prescribe me a new one
[03:49] you want me to hand you a piece of magic
that will solve all your troubles
[03:53] you people don’t take care of yourself at all
here, take you file
[03:59] there has to be a limit
[04:05] A doctor’s medicine doesn't help a patient
as much as a kind smile does
[04:22] okay so don't worry
[04:27] God willing, you will be fine
[04:31] just taking this medicine on time
[04:34] and come back for checkup in 2 days
okay?
[04:47] take this medicine on time
[04:50] Yes, I will but tell me one thing,
[04:54] are you feeling alright?
[04:59] He's fine, uncle.
you have got your medicine now leave!
[05:02] bye.
[05:10] Get the next patient.
That was the last one.
[05:14] really?
[05:18] Tell me one thing.
Ask away.
[05:22] Why did you get so worried?
[05:23] I wanted to ask about that friend of yours
[05:26] who would take care of the patients
around the hospital.
[05:30] Are you still in contact with her?
[05:31] You must be asking about Rania?
[05:35] Rania? Yes, her.
How is she?
[05:40] We don't talk that often,
[05:42] but these days she’s very busy
with her new mission.
[05:45] mission?
[05:47] What mission?
[05:48] Yes, sir, she’s trying to help
four people find love.
[05:54] four people?
[05:56] Sorry Sir, I’ll explain better
[05:59] Two of them are husband & wife,
[06:00] and the issue is that society
is keeping them apart.
[06:02] and the other two are single,
[06:04] and their issue is also the society
keeping them apart.
[06:09] Oh, well the next you speak with her ask her
how she is on my behalf.
[06:14] she’s a nice girl
[06:15] You remember her?
[06:17] People like her cannot be forgotten
[06:22] It’s time for the walkaround
[06:27] Tell me, have you eaten yet?
[06:30] me?
Yes you, who else is here?
[06:34] okay?
[06:36] I didn’t even bother to ask the doctor.
[06:41] I guess Dr. Wasiq’s screws got fixed.
[06:45] His tone is filled with sweetness
instead of bitterness.
[06:50] Come in!
[06:51] You took so long
[06:52] teacher should be punctual
[06:54] Yeah, sure, tell me
if I am dressed appropriately.
[06:58] Will Ammaji be impressed?
[07:01] According to historical evidence,
[07:02] no Ammaji cared about a man’s attire when deciding
whether or not he should be her son-in-law.
[07:07] What matters is the man’s education,
his disposition, his character, and his status.
[07:13] Dude, I have all of those things.
[07:17] Don’t worry.
[07:18] blowing your own trumpet,
I see.
[07:20] Sit down; I’ll bring the kids’ mother.
[07:23] Why the kids’ mother?
Bring Ammaji.
[07:27] I am very eager to impress her
[07:30] please!
Shenshah!
[07:31] Shenshah, where are you?
[07:34] Ammaji, look who’s here.
[07:36] This is Farhad from next door
[07:38] Greetings! Ammaji.
Greetings! Greetings!
[07:41] You’re lucky that I am in a
very good mood today.
[07:45] And you’ll be even happier to know
[07:48] that Mr. Farhad here will now
tutor Tipu and Mano.
[07:52] But is there a shortage of educated folks
at our own house
[07:57] that you have to ask
the neighbour’s help?
[07:59] Ammaji it was very hard
to convince him
[08:02] You know how hard it is
to deal with our kids,
[08:05] and he’ll be tutoring them for free.
Oh, okay, okay.
[08:08] Thank you so much!
[08:10] we are very grateful to you for agreeing
to tutor our stupid children
[08:13] I’ll go bring them in
God knows where they are
[08:16] Tipu! Mano!
Come see who’s here.
[08:19] Your master is here to tutor you
[08:23] Listen to me,
call Rabail
[08:25] At Least I’ll get to see her.
I will break your legs.
[08:29] Greetings!
[08:30] Go sit and study!
[08:32] I’ll study tomorrow, Mama.
[08:34] No, not tomorrow, Sit over there and study.
What’s wrong with studying today?
[08:38] See what a good and well-dressed
tutor you have.
[08:41] Do you think
he has nothing else to do?
[08:44] Is he an idiot, insane, or a donkey
that he is here to tutor you?
[08:48] bring out your books and study.
[08:50] Greetings!
[08:51] Thank you so much for tutoring my kids
I’ll go get Mano as well
[08:55] Tipu, get your books out.
[09:31] Hello?
Sir!
[09:33] Sir!
[09:36] Sir!
[09:37] Which book should I open?
[09:40] Any book that you can read
without my help will do.
[10:25] Sir!
[10:27] Sir!
[10:30] Sir!
[10:32] Is this fine?
[10:34] Yes, that’s fine.
[10:37] Do you know the ABCs?
read that.
[10:46] Are you serious?
[10:49] I cannot believe our very own rude doctor
is exhibiting signs of kindness.
[10:55] It seems as though he wants to kiss
and hug all the patients.
[11:02] he has been mingling
with everyone a lot
[11:04] You should come;
you’ll be surprised to see him.
[11:08] I am coming,
[11:10] this is not something
one should miss out on.
[11:12] Your words have real weight, Rania.
[11:15] Yes, they do,
I can make them all behave.
[11:19] Except the feral cat
who lives in this house
[11:22] He just keeps misbehaving.
[11:25] I see, you are talking about that
handsome boy, right?
[11:30] To be honest, his attitude suits him.
[11:33] Okay, stop it now,
[11:35] there’s no need to sing his praises.
[11:37] by the way, you are very lucky to be
blessed with a hero like Mahir.
[11:40] I see you can’t stop
singing his praises.
[11:46] Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you so much!
[11:51] You have not only made
my journey easier;
[11:53] you have also laid down
a soft rug on the road.
[11:57] I can now meet Rabail
any time I want.
[11:59] Anyway, I should go,
I’ll visit the hospital soon.
[12:02] Well, okay, talk later.
Okay, goodbye!
[12:12] What were you saying?
You seem pretty happy.
[12:15] I am sorry you were on a call
and I interrupted you.
[12:18] Actually, Ammaji not only had tea
made for me,
[12:21] she also joined me for…
What’s that proper word?
[12:26] Sipped?’
You mean she sipped tea with you?
[12:29] What? No.
What’s that word?
[12:32] Savor! Yeah
[12:35] She savoured tea alongside me.
[12:37] she also interviewed me and
she sat super close to me.
[12:43] Do you think you’ll be able
to clear that interview?
[12:46] My name is Farhad and
Farhad never loses.
[12:51] Well, congratulations
[12:54] but let me tell you these interviews
are a bit different from the rest.
[12:57] Even the best of the conquerors can fail
[13:02] Don’t scare me.
[13:04] Now that you have helped me so much,
can you do one last thing?
[13:11] plan a picnic or outing someday.
[13:12] I want to spend the day in a refreshing
and peaceful place with Rabail.
[13:15] Hey, don’t expect that from me.
[13:19] I have helped you enough.
[13:22] I don't understand why people get
so out of hand after falling in love.
[13:29] If you love her that much
then propose,
[13:32] and once you are engaged
[13:34] I don’t care if you go out for coffee
[13:36] or spend the day at a broken park bench
saying you love each other.
[13:39] No one would object,
do you understand?
[13:46] This girl is so cruel.
[13:48] Dear God, please make her fall in love
with some as well.
[13:52] Ameen.
[13:59] yes!
[14:01] cream cake!
this isn’t for you.
[14:06] I made this for Mahir.
[14:09] ordered,
Same thing.
[14:13] And for your kind information Mahir
and I will be having tea together.
[14:20] And we have been very close friends
since childhood.
[14:23] We have an understanding.
[14:25] And soon that friendship will be
turning into something more.
[14:30] What?
[14:32] Why did no one tell me that?
[14:34] This is breaking news.
[14:37] Two clowns together!
[14:38] Everyone in the family and the neighbours
will be in God's protection.
[14:41] What did you say?
[14:43] Oh look, Mahir is here.
[14:45] Mahir, come sit.
The tea is getting cold.
[14:48] Where is everyone else?
[14:49] Don’t worry about everyone else
and have some tea.
[14:52] And listen—why are you here?
Don’t you…
[14:55] Oh, yes, I was just about to sit.
[14:57] I meant you can’t sit here because
you have to go assist my sister in the kitchen;
[15:01] she may need your help.
Go!
[15:07] Wow, look at the preparations at the table
for the evening tea today.
[15:13] Bring me some tea as well.
wow.
[15:16] Why is there sugar in my tea?
[15:18] Is it too much? It’s okay,
[15:21] try this cake instead.
[15:24] Cake and sugar,
I don't eat such things.
[15:28] It'll compromise my diet.
[15:30] Give me some tea and
cut me a piece of cake.
[15:34] It looks delicious.
yes definitely.
[15:36] Let's eat it together.
[15:38] I'll give you some now.
[15:43] It looks so tasty.
Give me a fork.
[15:46] I'll eat it with a fork as well.
[15:48] one minute!
[15:52] Mona, where did you order
this cake from?
[15:54] It's so tasty.
[15:56] Very tasty!
Very, very tasty!
[15:58] Mona, my love, If you do this every day,
I swear it’ll be a treat.
[16:02] I wouldn't mind that.
[16:06] There’s no cup left for Mona;
how will she have her tea?
[16:09] That's no issue; we can always
make more tea.
[16:13] Try this nugget.
[16:18] Do you want some?
[16:20] Actually, no, it might mess
with your diet.
[16:21] We’ll eat it.
[16:24] Give me some of those biscuits,
[16:25] Forget the biscuits,
try this yellow thingy.
[16:28] That’s tart! Lemon tart.
[16:42] Come in, Come in.
Easy.
[16:46] I can’t believe you came to
my house on your own accord.
[16:49] I am here to meet Auntie and Laiba.
[16:52] Right! You girls are so clever.
[16:56] I know why you are here.
[16:58] You are here to meet me.
[17:00] Say that in front of Rania,
[17:02] and she’ll let you know
what clever means.
[17:06] Why are you getting upset?
Come in.
[17:11] Mama! Mama!
Look who’s here.
[17:14] the whole house is brightened
because of her.
[17:17] If you are going to say stupid things,
I'll leave.
[17:19] Mama’s here.
[17:21] Greetings! Auntie.
[17:23] Greetings! Rabail, you’re here?
[17:26] Why are you standing there?
Come! sit!
[17:30] She thought you weren’t home
and she wasn’t coming in.
[17:33] She thinks if there are no women
in the house, she shouldn’t come.
[17:36] That’s just how smart girls think.
[17:38] come! sit!
Where’s Laiba? Call her.
[17:41] Greetings! Uncle.
It's Ayaz.
[17:45] Greetings! Sister Rabail,
how are you?
[17:48] You've come after so long.
[17:51] I get so bored around the house,
you should come here more often.
[17:53] Laiba, you should visit her as well.
[17:56] They’re great people;
there are no restrictions from me.
[17:59] By the way, my mom doesn't like
a lot of people.
[18:03] That's probably
why I am still unmarried.
[18:07] Because my sister doesn’t like anyone.
[18:09] Shut up, Ayaz!
You always do this.
[18:13] what happened? I mean,
was there a tragedy?
[18:17] It's a very long story,
and it’s also super boring.
[18:21] So, if you know anyone, I mean,
if there’s anyone in your friends circle
[18:24] Who has an older sister,
even a divorcee,
[18:30] who’s interested in getting married
or someone who hasn’t found their ideal.
[18:36] you can refer them to me.
[18:39] Don’t you worry.
[18:40] I’ll ask Rania
[18:41] and she’ll do anything to get you married
Even if she has to split up another couple
[18:44] What, really? She sounds like
a woman of quality
[18:46] I'll contact her myself.
[18:49] My nephew has made her his sister
[18:51] and that makes her my niece as well
[18:54] Ayaz, please shut up.
[18:56] Child
[18:57] Where does your parents live?
[19:00] My parents are no more
in this world,
[19:02] they died in my childhood,
[19:04] and since then, me and my elder sister
lives with my grandmother’s house.
[19:07] Oh! Sorry,
[19:08] I wasn’t aware of it, I hurt you.
[19:12] No, aunt, it’s not like that.
[19:32] How is she?
what does he do?
[19:34] He has his own salon.
[19:36] It’s not that good, next.
[19:38] Okay one minute,
how is he?
[19:40] He is crazily love with me,
[19:43] he said that he will bring moon
and stars for me.
[19:45] And what he does?
[19:47] He loves me.
And?
[19:53] He does something?
What?
[19:56] He has his own phone shop,
and he gifted this phone to me as well
[20:01] You look happy.
[20:03] I am very happy,
[20:05] I went to Farhan’s house.
Wow
[20:07] And his family is better than him.
[20:09] Great.
I will just come.
[20:12] Okay.
[20:16] greetings.
[20:18] Greetings, come on,
you have a long age,
[20:22] and Mona was missing you.
[20:25] My son has done the shopping.
[20:27] Yes grandmother,
I am famous in the city,
[20:30] it is important to do shopping,
with these brands and all,
[20:34] grandmother,
I have to do this,
[20:36] Where are you going?
[20:38] I am a big brand conscious person,
[20:40] will you not give your opinion about
my shopping and spoil my mood?
[20:47] I don’t interfere in people’s matter.
[20:50] have you all listen to it children?
[20:53] The change is there.
[20:57] Mother, have you seen,
[21:00] now if I will say anything,
he will get jealous.
[21:04] Why can’t you both be friends?
[21:10] You always argue with each other,
on small matters.
[21:14] I don’t argue, at all,
[21:16] I don’t want to talk to him as well
[21:21] but he is there who always tried
to get free with me.
[21:26] Me? She is stupid.
[21:29] Child, she is a nice girl,
[21:32] why do you mind
whatever she is saying?
[21:37] I don’t understand,
are you my grandmother, or her?
[21:40] Whenever you see,
you always support her.
[21:43] Leave it child.
[21:46] Mother, Raina should not talk
like this about our Mahir.
[21:50] She is just joking,
[21:53] you are taking this seriously
for no reason.
[21:56] It wasn’t looking like a joke to me,
[21:58] just leave your phone.
[22:07] Have you noticed,
[22:09] our Mona is so mature now.
[22:13] Really?
[22:14] What have you seen in her that
you are saying she is mature?
[22:22] There is so much seriousness on her face
the forehead is also shining.
[22:26] Leave it,
[22:28] I can’t see properly,
so I can’t see all this,
[22:33] but if you are saying,
so it is enough for me.
[22:37] Go ahead.
[22:43] Now you see mother, since
she came here she is in the house,
[22:47] can you ask Mahir to take her out.
[22:51] Mahir doesn’t have all the responsibility,
[22:55] you can ask Hammad to take her out.
[22:57] Sister,
Mother.
[22:59] Yes?
[23:00] Mother, we are going out to take some
book in the market,
[23:03] we will come soon, lets go.
Wait,
[23:06] Mona, get up,
[23:08] and wear some proper dress,
[23:10] you can go out with them,
you always want to go out.
[23:13] No mother,
[23:15] we are not going out
for some enjoyment,
[23:17] we have to take 2 4 books.
[23:20] Right.
Let’s go. Bye.
[23:22] They are so happy,
they were ready too,
[23:27] they are going to take books,
I am amazed.
[23:29] What is your problem?
Nothing.
[23:45] Thank God, we cut Mona off,

[23:48] Yes, I was scared.
[23:50] I think she mind it.

Receive the call.
[23:55] Hello, yes, hello,

[24:09] Yes, you can go and have
a date with him,

[24:14] Go.
[24:16] Goodluck!
[24:20] What will we do now?

[24:22] No.
[24:23] We will do shopping,

something from here,
[24:29] there are so nice things over here,

[24:30] okay they belong to boys.
[24:32] There is 50% off right now.
[24:36] Please exchange this brother
Sure sir, is there an issue in your size?
[24:40] Size is fine, actually,
[24:42] our prince six packs are not
getting prominent in these shirts.
[24:46] What he is doing here?

[24:49] We will be killed only when
he will see us, just step back.
[24:52] He is joking,
I have other prints as well,
[24:57] I don’t repeat the prints again.
[25:00] We will get something new.

He is here to shop.
[25:15] Mahir, I am hungry,
[25:17] let’s have food and then
we will do something else.
[25:20] we just came here to shop,
and you are hungry.
[25:22] Hungry.
[25:23] Now will we shop
or have food first?
[25:25] You earn in dollars,
still you are so miser.
[25:28] I am not being miser, you will remember,
you have a rich friend,
[25:32] first we will eat something and then
we will come again for shirt exchange.
[25:36] Let’s go to food court.
[25:38] Food court, sister.

[30:03] Everything is fine,
but your son,
[30:07] I guess, he doesn’t like me
staying here.
[30:09] Why child?
You are very nice.
[30:13] He doesn’t think like this,
[30:15] he thinks, since I am here,
my expenses have been increased,
[30:18] I am thinking that I will start
giving him my expense.
[30:24] He is thinking like this being
the child of Dabeer Hassan,
[30:31] go and call him, I will fix him.
[30:35] Not now, he will roam around the city
and will come late at night,
[30:41] and do you know he comes late,
[30:42] and no one ask him
where is he coming from,
[30:46] of course,
[30:49] if he will take the expenses
of the entire house,
[30:51] then he will be proud anyways.
[30:53] Oh God.
[30:55] Do you know, he is angry always
[30:57] and the whole family is scared
of his anger.
[31:00] Listen to me, child, you don’t have
to get scared of his anger,
[31:04] and whatever he says,
[31:06] just ignore it,
[31:08] this is your uncle’s house,
[31:10] you can stay here easily, and
do keep me posted of everything.
