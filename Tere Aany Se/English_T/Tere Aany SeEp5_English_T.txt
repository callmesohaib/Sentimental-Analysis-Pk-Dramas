[00:18] Son, call your father.
[00:22] It has been a few days that
he didn’t call, I am worried.
[00:25] Hey grandma,
you don’t need to worry,
[00:28] and when does papa call daily.
[00:30] He must be fine.
Really?
[00:32] and I also wanted to tell you something.
[00:34] He is going to talk about Ifrah.
[00:36] Yes, tell me what is it?
[00:38] Grandma, I am going
to Murree with my friends,
[00:41] I will come back in three to four days.
[00:42] Okay.
Really?
[00:43] Who are they?
Tell their names as well.
[00:45] I am talking to my grandma,
[00:47] irrelevant people should stay out of it.
[00:50] Do you see mama,
how he is talking to me?
[00:52] I see it.
[00:53] I had told you earlier as well,
this girl is
[00:56] my youngest brother’s
last family member.
[01:00] So you deal with her
with love and affection.
[01:03] and you will see grandma,
really soon,
[01:06] this last family member will not only set fire
to this home, but also this entire city.
[01:09] God forbid.
[01:12] Hide it. Hide it,
as much as you can.
[01:14] But the learned people have said,
[01:17] love and scent doesn’t stay hidden,
no matter how much you try.
[01:19] Huh? What are you saying?
[01:23] It is a secret.
But swear to God,
[01:25] you won’t mention it to anyone.
[01:27] Is it something dangerous?
[01:28] It is dangerous for me.
[01:30] If Mahir finds out I leaked his secret,
[01:33] God knows what he will do with me.
[01:35] But you are not in danger.
[01:37] Okay come on, tell me quickly.
[01:39] Your beloved is in love.
[01:44] He is in love? Huh?
[01:45] Slowly. Slowly.
[01:47] With whom?
[01:49] That’s what I am spying on,
[01:51] and I have full hopes that
I will be successful soon.
[01:54] Hey, I cannot tell you how happy
I am to hear this news.
[01:58] He always used to say that
my standard is so high
[02:01] that no girl can reach that standard.
[02:04] But now she likes someone,
[02:05] then it means he found
a girl his standard.
[02:09] But I don’t understand one thing,
[02:12] why is he hiding it from anyone?
[02:15] Why is he planning so secretly?
[02:17] really? What planning?
[02:20] Someday, some people will come
to this home with excuses.
[02:23] For example, they want a home on rent,
[02:26] or it is possible they will say
they want to buy a home.
[02:29] They will ask you if there is any room
available in the neighbourhood.
[02:33] Then what do I have to say?
[02:34] Say anything.
[02:36] This is just an excuse, mama.
[02:38] Actually, they are coming over
to review the home and all of us.
[02:42] This means, that we need
to be ready every day.
[02:45] Yes, what else?
[02:47] But I didn’t understand one thing.
[02:49] Then ask, mama. Ask,
why am I here? Ask me. Ask.
[02:53] Look, as per the rule the boy’s family
first visits the girl’s family,
[02:58] but here the girl’s family is first
coming here to the boy’s family.
[03:02] Yes.
[03:03] It is the opposite.
[03:04] I got it. I feel mama,
[03:07] your grandson has got his hands
at a high place.
[03:12] He has trapped a pretty and
delicate temperament girl.
[03:16] What?
[03:16] The girl I feel has surely put a condition
[03:18] that till the time she doesn’t like
the family along with the boy,
[03:21] she will not say yes.
[03:24] Right?
That’s how it must be.
[03:26] You know the girls nowadays
have a lot of tantrums.
[03:29] Fine then, let’s prepare...
[03:31] You have to wear good and expensive
dresses like this daily
[03:35] and wear these earrings etc.
[03:38] After all, you are the boy’s grandmother,
right?
[03:41] Yes, that I am.
[03:54] Hello. Hello.
[03:57] Oh hello dad, greetings.
[03:58] How are you?
You must be fine.
[04:01] Yes, son, you are right.
[04:05] Only humans get unwell,
I am not human.
[04:08] I am a robot.
Have robots ever gotten unwell?
[04:11] Tell me,
[04:13] are all the humans there fine?
[04:15] Hey dad, you get emotional
on everything.
[04:19] Who do you take up after?
[04:21] All of us here are really practical.
[04:24] I forgot to tell you the most important thing.
[04:25] Okay dad, I am going
to Murree with my friends.
[04:28] It is snowing there,
to see that.
[04:30] Hey son, is snowfall even a thing to see?
[04:33] Here, you have knee height snow
here all the time.
[04:36] We are tired of seeing it.
[04:38] You are going to see snowfall.
[04:40] By the way,
son as far as I can remember,
[04:43] there are a lot of monkeys there,
people go there to see monkeys.
[04:47] If you have to go see monkeys then go.
[04:49] Yes, yes, I will also see that dad.
[04:51] But I am going there,
but I cannot go.
[04:54] Why are you talking like a monkey?
[04:56] You just said that you are going.
[04:58] Did you join politics?
[05:01] You always change your statements.
Idiot.
[05:04] Dad, it is not that.
It is really cold in Murree,
[05:07] for that dad, you need
a lot of warm clothes.
[05:09] I don’t have money to buy warm clothes.
[05:12] What?
[05:13] You don’t have money?
You don’t have money.
[05:15] Hey, what do you people
do with the dollars?
[05:18] Do you make paper boats with it
and sail them over water?
[05:21] Or do you put them at the fire place,
set them on fire and warm your hands?
[05:25] Whenever you call,
you just say one thing.
[05:28] We don’t have money. We don’t have money.
We don’t have money.
[05:30] So you tell me,
what I should do?
[05:32] The inflation has reached the skies
[05:34] and the family is so big,
[05:36] who have so many expenses.
[05:38] Dad, you are sitting comfortably over there
and enjoying your life.
[05:41] Here, who has the responsibility
of the entire home?
[05:43] Poor me.
[05:44] The responsibility of the whole home
is on my weak shoulders.
[05:46] Dad, you tell me, what should I do?
[05:47] You tell me, should I quit studies.
[05:49] Should I quit studies,
and become a driver, or a rider?
[05:51] If you tell me,
I will setup a fruit stall.
[05:53] No. No. No.
My son. No.
[05:56] Why will you do these small things?
[05:58] To do these things, your father is alive,
he is here,
[06:02] to send you the dollars.
[06:05] Why will you do this my love?
[06:07] Dad, don’t drag it. Tell me,
when are you going to send the money?
[06:11] I will send it by tomorrow evening.
[06:13] love you dad. Love you.
You are the best dad.
[06:14] But listen to me.
[06:16] Okay dad, the battery is low.
The battery is low.
[06:18] Huh? He disconnected it and went.
[06:20] Look at that, they are so selfish.
[06:23] As soon as their objective is met,
[06:25] they quickly say okay dad
I am going I am getting late.
[06:28] Yes, we have the time.
[06:30] The work is done.
[06:33] The dollars will come.
[06:36] Now I will enjoy the trip.
[06:38] Should I keep this or not?
Can I come?
[06:42] You have already come inside.
[06:45] Do you want something?
[06:46] I have been seeing for so long
that you are so busy,
[06:48] so I thought I would help you out.
[06:50] Give it to me, I will pack…
[06:51] There is no need to touch anything.
[06:53] Thank you.
[06:55] Look, now your own help you out.
[06:59] But I feel that you still haven’t added me
in the list of your own.
[07:02] Correct. You feel the right thing.
[07:06] It is really wrong.
[07:07] Hey, you will help me,
[07:10] when I will pack something and take it.
[07:13] I will shop for everything new,
[07:16] and all my friends will be left staring.
[07:19] What difference does new clothes
make to your friends?
[07:22] Hey, who shops fresh
for such a short trip?
[07:26] This is something only
a spend thrift like me can do.
[07:29] Who has a big pocket, a big heart,
[07:32] he has more respect.
[07:35] Okay,
[07:36] so you mean to say that
respect is increased with clothes.
[07:40] Correct.
[07:41] My husband has a lot of respect
in his city
[07:44] and he doesn’t shop daily.
[07:46] I have a total of four dresses,
[07:49] but thank God,
I have a lot of respect in my city,
[07:52] and after coming here, here too…
Are you done?
[07:55] Is your speech over?
So you can leave.
[07:57] Thank you.
Keep on sitting.
[08:01] Yes, Salik. Yes. Yes.
The plan is done.
[08:06] You know he is a big show off.
[08:09] God have mercy on Irfah.
[08:13] Why are there no signals? Oh. Oh.
[08:17] Oh. Hey, mama is here
[08:19] I had to go for an interview,
I forgot.
[08:23] You have to do one thing,
if sister asks about my interview,
[08:25] then you say that
uncle went for the interview,
[08:27] it went well, it was great but right at the
last moment, someone came through contacts
[08:30] and he got the job.
What will you say?
[08:33] Repeat.
Meaning, you….
[08:37] Oh, I am tired today.
[08:42] What happened?
You came so soon, mama.
[08:45] Ayaz, get me water.
Yes, sister.
[08:48] Hey, when did I go to attend
a mehndi function?
[08:50] It was Sarwat’s second husbands
third day of mourning,
[08:52] poor thing looked really sad.
[08:54] Sarwat’s husband is dead?
[08:55] Sarwat’s husband is dead.
Sarwat’s husband is dead.
[08:58] Hey, what do you mean?
Why do you have a glow in your eyes?
[09:02] Have you forgotten,
this is the same Sarwat,
[09:04] who said no to your proposal
when she was single.
[09:08] She considered your salary to be low.
[09:10] She married that fat businessman,
[09:12] and if your memory works correctly,
[09:15] then after the death of that fat businessman,
[09:17] you sent a proposal and got me insulted
[09:19] and even then, she rejected your proposal
and accepted the proposal of that businessman.
[09:23] Now. Now, what do you want?
[09:25] Such an arrogant aunty.
She ignored uncle twice.
[09:29] I am telling you forget about this aunty.
[09:32] There are many other girls
in the world, consider them.
[09:35] Where are those girls?
Where are those girls?
[09:37] Huh?
[09:39] Waiting for them,
I have white hair,
[09:42] my eyesight got weak,
where are those girls?
[09:44] I have knee pain.
Where are those girls, sister?
[09:47] I was single,
[09:49] I am single, I will remain single.
[09:51] Hey, God forbid,
what nonsense are you speaking?
[09:53] Disappointment is a sin.
I am telling you,
[09:56] you will wear a flowered veil soon.
[09:57] Where is that veil?
And where are those flowers?
[09:59] Where is the veil?
Sister, where is that veil?
[10:01] Okay, you tell me,
you had an interview today,
[10:04] how did it go?
[10:05] I am crying, you tell her the tragedy.
[10:07] Yes, yes, I remembered.
[10:09] Actually mama,
she went for the interview,
[10:11] his interview went really well,
[10:13] but at the last moment someone
got the job through contacts.
[10:15] That’s what you told me, right?
Sister…
[10:16] Meaning, you didn’t get a job,
[10:19] and instead of getting worried for this,
you are dying to get married.
[10:22] Who will give their daughter
to someone jobless like you?
[10:24] Sister, that is why I am saying
[10:26] that if there is a widow, a divorcee,
even she would do.
[10:29] What do you mean?
Will the not have to be fed?
[10:32] Will she consume air?
Hey, when will you learn?
[10:35] Sister, where are those billionaires,
[10:37] whose husband’s die,
who gets divorced.
[10:40] Why am I not getting proposals
for them? Huh?
[10:44] What do we need to cook
for food today?
[10:50] This jacket looks good,
how much is it for?
[10:53] 25000?
[10:57] It is fine, it is just 100 dollars.
[10:59] Mahir.
[11:01] Yes, grandma.
[11:03] I am thinking of getting you married.
[11:06] Grandma, right now I am shopping
to go to Murree,
[11:10] this marriage…
[11:13] marriage?
[11:14] One second,
[11:15] I hope you are not thinking of getting me
married to your beloved brother’s granddaughter.
[11:18] You got shocked, right?
[11:20] Don’t worry, I don’t believe
in forcing relations.
[11:23] After all, I will get you married
by your liking.
[11:28] Thank God, grandma.
I am able to breathe again.
[11:30] Why?
[11:31] My blood pressure just jumped up.
[11:33] Mine too.
[11:35] Why yours?
[11:36] Mama, there should be a match too.
[11:39] My nephew is a prince, and then she..,
[11:42] And then your brother’s amazing last child,
[11:46] who in future will set the whole city on fire.
[11:48] God forbid.
Say something good for once.
[11:51] She is such a good girl,
so respecting, obedient.
[11:55] Yes, yes, she is a really good girl.
[11:56] But the eyes you need
to see her qualities,
[11:59] we don’t have that grandma.
Right, aunt?
[12:03] Yes, I agree with you people.
[12:06] You don’t have that sight.
[12:10] Grandma, I am thinking
I will get something for you.
[12:12] there is a sale.
To hell with it.
[12:14] Hey, don’t move. Don’t move.
[12:15] Is it out.
[12:17] Oh God, Rabail,
you have a whole colony.
[12:21] Thank God I have come,
[12:23] or else you would have a
whole society till now.
[12:25] You know, I swear to God, she has had
lices in her hair since childhood.
[12:29] God forbid, she lies so much,
[12:31] even she used to get it.
[12:32] Hey, don’t move.
Don’t move. One more.
[12:35] Oh God, such long hair,
you also have to keep it clean.
[12:39] Okay, what am I thinking?
[12:41] Lets take Rania to a good place
for shopping.
[12:43] Yes, good thought.
[12:45] What do you say, Rania?
Will you come with us.
[12:47] Yes. By the way, sister Saman.
Yes?
[12:49] You don’t care about
your poor husband at all.
[12:53] You don’t sympathize with him at all.
[12:55] The poor thing is suffering in your love.
[12:58] At times he sends his father,
he sends his brother.
[13:00] He is calling you again and again.
[13:02] But you don’t move an inch.
[13:04] You don’t care about him one bit.
[13:06] Arbab is like that.
[13:07] Whenever I come to my parents’ home,
he gets sad.
[13:10] Actually, he loves me a lot.
[13:12] Then you should also care for his love.
Right, Rabail?
[13:16] Yes, you should.
[13:19] Such husbands are one in a million.
[13:21] And your father in law, and that...
what is his name, Khawar?
[13:25] My brother in law.
Yes.
[13:26] He loves you so much
and cares for you.
[13:29] But you.
[13:31] you don’t care at all.
Go home, I am telling you.
[13:34] Go sit at home and take care of him.
[13:36] You know that is true,
[13:38] I am really lucky,
when it comes to love.
[13:39] I am thinking I will go soon.
[13:41] I won't bother Arbab too much.
[13:44] Fine, then I will also come to your home.
[13:46] Hey, we will come and see all the stories
your father in law tells us,
[13:50] what Taj Mahal has he built.
[13:57] Oh, move. Move. Move.
What happened?
[14:00] What happened?
What happened to her?
[14:04] Hey, apply oil before you go, Rania.
[14:07] She always does things incomplete.
[14:10] She is calling me now.
[14:11] Hello. Where are you lost, Salik?
[14:14] I have been calling you for so long,
at least answer my call.
[14:17] Okay listen, listen, listen,
[14:18] all the setting is made,
[14:20] the girl’s family will come to your home
with the excuse of looking for a home.
[14:24] Just be careful about one thing,
[14:26] for God’s sake,
don’t misbehave with them.
[14:28] Yes,
[14:31] this happens.
[14:33] It is love.
[14:36] You have to put in some
extra effort in love.
[14:39] Hey, when the family doesn’t agree,
[14:41] then what can a person do?
[14:43] No issues. No issues,
[14:45] you have to put in some effort
to get your love.
[14:51] Fine. Fine. Okay listen, one important…
[14:58] The bulb of my room got fused,
it was kept here.
[15:02] Did you give my number to one
of your close relative?
[15:05] No. For no reason? Why?
[15:08] Hey, why do you come over
when I get a call?
[15:12] What do you think that
I am an enemy of the state
[15:15] or an agent from another country
[15:16] that I am conveying a message
on the phone.
[15:18] That’s what I am thinking.
[15:20] It didn’t feel that way earlier,
[15:21] but now I feel that way.
[15:23] That is why you say secret things
on the phone.
[15:24] Who were you talking to?
[15:26] Hey, I am talking to Salik.
[15:27] He is my friend. Do you want to talk to him?
Do you? Should I make you talk to him?
[15:29] Why would I want to?
[15:30] that’s what I am asking you,
[15:32] why do you want to interfere
in my matters?
[15:34] You know, you can trust me.
[15:38] I know how to keep a secret a secret.
[15:41] After all, I don’t mind anything you say,
[15:44] because I know you have
a lot of pain inside you.
[15:50] The pain of loneliness bothers
you day and night.
[15:55] You want to cry,
[15:56] but this damned manliness
comes in the way.
[15:59] I didn’t know,
[16:01] I am in such a bad shame.
[16:03] My God.
[16:05] Thank you so much you told me.
[16:07] I want to feel my pain alone,
[16:12] I want to cry openly.
You go from here.
[16:17] Huh?
[16:18] Can you please, get out.
[16:24] Loneliness.
[16:26] I want to cry?
[16:33] Mama, fix your eyeliner.
[16:35] Huh?
Yes, it is fine.
[16:37] Is it fine now? Listen, call Naheed.
[16:41] They said they would be back in two days,
it is three days now.
[16:44] Ask where he went?
[16:45] And where are his guests?
I sit daily doing makeup,
[16:49] and we don’t know where they are.
[16:51] Mama, what guests are you
talking about?
[16:53] Oh.
[16:54] Mama. Mama,
[16:56] an old man, and a young man,
who looks like a butcher,
[17:00] they are saying
you are selling a property.
[17:04] That’s them. That’s them, mama.
That’s them.
[17:06] They have come to check on us
with an excuse.
[17:08] Hey what are you looking at?
Go seat them.
[17:11] Listen, bring them with a lot of respect.
Understand?
[17:14] Go. Oh mama, I am so excited,
I cannot tell you.
[17:17] come on, let’s go.
[17:19] Come on. Come on.
[17:20] Mama, by the way, who are these people?
What property are they talking about?
[17:22] Mama, see the words they are using.
[17:25] Do you want to give us
your property or not?
[17:29] What is a bigger wealth for us,
then Mahir? Huh?
[17:33] You know I don’t understand
what you people are talking about?
[17:35] Hey they have come
with a proposal for Mahir,
[17:38] and actually, they have come
to see our home and behaviour.
[17:41] Now you people be really courteous.
[17:44] What if we miss this proposal
cause of you people.
[17:46] Yes, and this girl is Mahir’s love.
[17:50] Come on, come on, hey,
I didn’t wear my shoes.
[17:55] Wait for me.
[18:09] Greetings.
[18:11] Greetings.
[18:12] Hey, mama, this is your home, right?
Sit. Sit. Come on, sit.
[18:15] Yes. yes.
[18:19] Come, sit. Sit.
[18:21] Yes.
[18:24] Shehanshah, go arrange tea
and snacks. Come on.
[18:27] No. No. there is no need for that.
[18:30] We came here to talk about the property.
[18:34] My name is Nizam Uddin and
this is my son, Imamdin.
[18:39] We have heard that
you have a property for sale.
[18:44] Hah,
[18:45] by saying sale,
you have hurt my heart.
[18:48] I didn’t like that at all. No. No.
[18:53] So, you tell me,
what word should we use?
[18:58] Uncle, we don’t believe in selling,
[19:03] we are presenting a present to you.
[19:08] Believe me,
it is mama’s entire universe.
[19:12] You just accept the gift,
don’t say no,
[19:16] or else it will break our heart.
[19:17] No. No. No. We wont say no,
[19:20] and we accept it.
[19:22] We accept it completely.
[19:34] Let’s go have tea. Come on.
[19:36] Come on. Come on.
Come.
[19:43] Will you tell me some details?
[19:47] Look these are delicate matters,
[19:50] in fact, I would say that if you let us
meet a man of your home,
[19:55] it would be better.
[19:57] Why not? Why not?
[19:59] We will introduce you to everyone.
[20:00] We know well that you have come
to meet the man of the home,
[20:06] but unfortunately, he is not at home.
[20:08] You will have to visit again.
[20:11] But anyway, now we will have visits.
[20:14] Look, then you got into the formality
of this tea and snacks for no reason.
[20:18] Okay, then we will leave.
[20:20] You do one thing,
[20:22] you give us your contact number
and you take our number.
[20:26] Now we will have to stay in touch.
[20:29] So, soon?
[20:30] We won’t let you go so soon uncle.
[20:32] We too want to do some inquiry,
right mama?
[20:36] Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.
We should inquire.
[20:41] Yes, so we have no objections either.
[20:43] Yes, this is the sign of people
from good families.
[20:48] So, how many children do you have?
[20:51] I have three children.
[20:53] Okay.
[20:54] This is my elder son, and then
I have another son after him,
[20:57] who helps us out in the business.
[21:00] I also have a daughter,
she is studying right now.
[21:05] This is really good.
[21:07] You should educate girls, right?
[21:10] But what if the proposal gets fixed,
there is no harm in that.
[21:15] Girls study after marriage too.
Right, mama?
[21:17] Yes, yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[21:19] You tell me, what do you think?
[21:22] Yes, I find what you say really reasonable.
[21:26] You found it to be reasonable, right?
[21:29] then we found it to be really reasonable.
[21:33] So what is the delay for?
[21:35] Should we fix the proposal?
[21:37] To fix the proposal of a girl,
you need a boy too, sister.
[21:44] Hey, you are calling me your sister,
and you are also acting like a stranger.
[21:48] Hey, we have a boy at our home,
that is why we are talking.
[21:54] Papa, I say that the environment of
the home looks decent through the women,
[21:58] the son will also be good,
reasonable, take things forward.
[22:04] Yes, yes, all that is fine,
but suddenly like this?
[22:09] Not suddenly,
[22:10] this was a long planning we know this.
[22:13] We like your girl with all our heart.
[22:18] Without seeing her?
[22:20] Hey, what is there to see?
[22:21] She is your daughter so she would be
simple and smart like you, right?
[22:43] My samosa. 
Give me my samosa.
[22:46] Give me my samosa.
I want my samosa.
[22:48] Give me my samosa.
Give it. I will cry a lot.
[23:00] I want the mobile.
[23:02] Give me the mobile.
Get me a mobile.
[23:12] I don’t know, they feel confused.
[23:16] Mama, one second.
One second.
[23:19] The whole family knows about
our daughter’s angry temperament.
[23:23] That is why no one sends a proposal.
[23:26] These people are getting trapped,
so we shouldn’t say no.
[23:30] Hey papa, we will fix
the proposal before we leave.
[23:32] Hey, all that is fine,
[23:34] but what if the boy is handicapped,
blind, deaf, or mute.
[23:38] Here you go,
here is the boy too.
[23:42] Isn’t he handsome?
[23:51] You are asking for our daughter’s hand
for this prince?
[23:56] They want it like this.
[23:58] see how they are acting,
[24:01] they have come with the excuse
of the property.
[24:03] Yes.
[24:04] We really liked you people.
[24:07] Yes, even we don’t have an objection,
[24:10] but the thing is we will ask
for time as per the custom.
[24:14] We are the girl’s family.
[24:16] Yes, why not? Sure.
[24:18] Hey papa, before their mind changes,
we should leave. Fix everything.
[24:22] Then consider the proposal final
from us as well.
[24:27] Oh congratulations.
Have sweets. Have sweets.
[24:30] Have some sweets. Have some sweets.
You too have it. Have some sweets.
[24:35] Yes, great.
[24:39] Okay, then I will wait
for your phone call.
[24:43] Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
We will go now sister.
[24:47] Yes, there my son and
daughter in law are here.
[24:49] Come. Come.
These are Mahir’s future in-laws
[24:53] and we have fixed Mahir’s proposal.
[24:57] Okay, goodbye.
Goodbye.
[25:14] Mama, what are you saying?
How can you fix Mahir’s proposal.
[25:18] Hamad, did you see?
What I say is right,
[25:21] you have no place in this home. Because of you,
no one respects me either.
[25:24] They didn’t even bother asking us,
[25:27] they did everything behind our back
and now she is announcing it.
[25:29] Be quiet.
[25:30] Don’t instigate my son being
the queen of emotions.
[25:33] This proposal hasn’t been fixed
with our will, but with Mahir’s will.
[25:36] Oh, with Mahir’s will?
[25:38] He used to think so highly.
[25:40] I thought he would marry a princess.
[25:43] See these people,
[25:44] they don’t even look like the servants
working at the castle of a princess.
[25:47] Even my heart is worried,
[25:50] but thank God, Mahir has agreed
to get married.
[25:53] Now I pray to God,
that the girl is as per our standard.
[25:56] What if we get a shock seeing her.
[26:05] It was such a memorable trip.
[26:06] I had fun, I would say let’s go back.
[26:08] Lets do one thing,
we will drop him here.
[26:11] You go back, brother.
[26:13] Hey, great weather and such friends.
[26:16] It is amazing. Wow.
[26:18] Hey man, all of you stay quiet,
I am getting a call from home.
[26:21] Hey you…
[26:22] Yes, greeting grandma.
[26:23] Greetings son,
when are you reaching?
[26:27] Grandma, I will reach in an hour.
[26:29] Okay great. I am waiting for you
impatiently come quickly.
[26:34] Okay grandma. okay. I am coming.
[26:36] Come soon.
[26:45] His face tells us that he is shocked
to hear about his marriage.
[26:55] This is a joke, right?
[26:57] You people are joking with me, right?
[27:00] This is not a joke,
it is a reality.
[27:04] And all this happened cause of Rania.
Thank her.
[27:08] Mama, what is the need to thank me?
[27:11] This was my responsibility.
[27:18] Tell me, something.
[27:21] Who sent you here?
[27:25] What is the conspiracy that
you have come here with?
[27:28] What do you mean?
[27:29] Don’t lie to me.
[27:31] Who wants to ruin my happiness?
[27:33] There is someone who has sent you
on a mission that go,
[27:36] go and ruin Mahir’s life.
Who is he? Who is he?
[27:41] Oh, what is wrong with you?
What are you saying?
[27:45] I think he has lost his mind a
little out of happiness, mama.
[27:49] Really?
[27:51] If I have lost my mind a little,
[27:54] then you have lost your mind completely.
[27:56] Who told you that I want
to get married like this?
[28:01] Don’t deny it.
Don’t deny it.
[28:03] I had heard with my own ears,
[28:06] he was giving new ideas.
[28:08] Send the family over to check
the property as an excuse.
[28:11] Where?
Home, where else?
[28:14] Whose home?
[28:16] Hey, you must have called them
to our home.
[28:20] Hey idiot,
[28:22] I had asked Ifrah’s family
to go to Salik’s home.
[28:25] Why?
[28:26] Because Salik and Ifrah love each other.
[28:47] Stop. Stop. Where?
[28:50] First answer me,
[28:52] who told you to interfere in my matter?
[28:55] Son, the wish to get you married was
in my heart for so long.
[29:02] But when Rania told me that
you are planning secretly with a girl,
[29:08] then I had put her to spy on you.
[29:12] This is the limit.
[29:13] Salik is such a good friend of mine,
[29:16] and Irfah too.
She is such an old friend of mine.
[29:18] They will think that I did all this.
[29:21] I stabbed them in the back.
[29:23] Now how will I go explain to them
[29:25] that I didn’t show this enmity,
it has been done by mama’s beloved.
[29:30] Mahir, I sympathize with you completely.
[29:33] You leave it. Please.
[29:35] I don’t want any sympathies from you.
[29:36] One minute. Everyone wait.
[29:39] Control your emotions and
hear me out.
[29:43] Hey, for God’s sake,
I beg you, I request you,
[29:47] now don’t give any more ideas,
we will handle it.
[29:50] You go and rest in your room. Go.
[29:52] Mama.
Yes?
[29:53] The thing to think about is
[29:55] that Mahir had told Ifrah to send her family
over to Salik’s home with an excuse.
[30:02] So that they can change their opinion
by showing their good nature.
[30:05] That’s what you had said, right?
Yes, so?
[30:07] So then why did Ifrah’s family come here
and not go to Salik’s home?
[30:11] Yes.
[30:13] This is something
we need to think about.
[30:15] Yes, mama, now there can only be
two things.
[30:18] Either that madam Ifrah likes him
[30:23] and she sent her family here on purpose
instead of Salik’s home
[30:27] or else…
[30:28] or else,
[30:31] those people who came, they…
[30:36] they were not Ifrah’s family.
[30:42] Yes, this.
[30:44] This second thing is correct.
[30:46] Oh.
[30:48] This means those people actually came here
for the property.
[30:52] Yes.
[30:53] that’s how it seems.
[30:55] I found them to have really good luck.
[30:58] They came for something ordinary and
something so big happened.
[31:01] They got such a good proposal
doing nothing.
[31:04] What is wrong, uncle?
[31:05] Are you still stuck on the same thing?
[31:07] No, not at all.
[31:09] I am telling you grandma,
I am not the hero from the 80s
[31:12] that I will get married where you tell me
to and to whom you want.
[31:14] I will get married by my will.
[31:17] Now nothing can be done, brother Mahir.
The proposal is fixed,
[31:20] and we are people from a good family,
[31:22] we don’t step back after giving our word.
[31:23] Really?
[31:25] If you care so much about
your family’s customs and traditions,
[31:28] then this uncle who is sitting here,
[31:30] get him married for the second time.
[31:36] What? What is wrong?
[31:38] What are you saying?
[31:40] Why are your eyes glowing up?
[31:43] everyone listen to me carefully,
[31:45] I am the daughter in law of this home.
[31:47] I swear to Hamad’s head,
you don’t have to repeat this again.
[31:50] You come with me.
[31:52] What is wrong?
We have a serious issue here,
[31:54] my presence here is important.
[31:58] Come on.
[31:59] I say come on.
[32:02] This is the limit.
[32:05] Oh, what will happen now?
[32:08] What would I know?
[32:09] it is a problem of you people,
[32:11] deal with it yourself.
[32:28] What is wrong? Why are you so angry?
[32:30] Drink cold water.
[32:32] Cool down. I don’t like your style.
[32:35] I saw with these eyes,
[32:36] how your eyes got a glow like a 200 watt bulb
on the mention of the second marriage.
[32:42] I don’t know,
[32:43] did I have a glow in my eyes?
[32:45] You should have at least scolded Mahir
on such a bad joke.
[32:49] I…I…I…I…was about to scold him,
[32:52] you started scolding me.
[32:54] Had you waited a little you would have seen
how badly I would have scolded him.
[32:59] I am going out to check the scene.
[33:04] And if you try to come out,
I will break your…
[33:07] I understand. I understand.
[33:11] Second marriage.
[33:18] Hey, hey, hey, brother Mahir,
you cannot go anywhere.
[33:21] Where are you going?
[33:22] This matter is yours equally as it is ours.
[33:24] Had you not advised that girl secretly,
[33:27] neither would we have had
a misunderstanding.
[33:30] Mama,
[33:31] you must have the number of those
elderly people in your phone, right?
[33:33] Give it to me,
I will sort the issue right now.
[33:36] Oh hello, leave it.
[33:38] No need to give her the phone, grandma.
[33:40] I cannot trust you,
[33:42] if you could you would fix
my wedding date today.
[33:45] Mama, you are worried how we have to
excuse ourselves, right?
[33:48] Yes.
[33:49] Then I will talk to them. I will talk
diplomatically in a decent manner.
[33:51] Hey, I am an expert in these things.
Give it to me.
[33:54] No, grandma, no.
Grandma…
[34:00] Okay, the game is over,
[34:01] give me all the money
that you had bet.
[34:07] Here…
[34:10] Hey, it wasn’t fifty rupees, the bet was for
sixty rupees, give me ten rupees more.
[34:15] Yes,
[34:16] it is fine.
[34:20] One minute.
[34:23] Greetings. Mr. Nizam Uddin.
How are you?
[34:27] Who are you?
[34:30] I am the same where you fixed
the wedding of your unlucky girl.
[34:35] What are you saying?
[34:37] Why would our daughter be unlucky?
[34:41] You too are unlucky.
[34:43] You didn’t think for a moment,
[34:46] these people who are fixing the proposal
without seeing your daughter,
[34:50] there can be an issue.
[34:52] Hey, okay, you didn’t fix the proposal,
but we asked for the proposal, right?
[34:56] Hey, the old woman got impressed
with the decency on our face
[35:00] and asked for the proposal.
[35:04] I think uncle you have never seen
your face in the mirror.
[35:07] You look like a spy.
[35:09] And your son, he looks like a
mad wolf, I swear.
[35:14] Hey, hey, who are you?
[35:16] Why are you insulting me so much?
[35:20] I am a member of this family.
[35:23] My conscience woke up,
[35:25] and I thought I would inform you.
[35:27] You don’t be fooled by these schemers.
[35:31] Their son is completely mad.
[35:34] And they are planning to get him
married to a family like yours.
[35:37] Huh?
[35:39] Are you speaking the truth?
[35:41] Yes, it is 100% true.
[35:43] You know, he is not that mad,
but when he gets a fit,
[35:47] God forgive me,
it is an intense attack, I swear.
[35:50] He does weird things,
he loses his senses.
[35:54] He starts biting on the bed sheet,
[35:58] and on top of that, he holds on hard
to the pillow and starts singing.
[36:03] Hey, do you not have shame?
[36:05] You were going to fix the proposal of
such a mad man with our daughter?
[36:09] Huh.
[36:10] I pray to God his wedding
is fixed with you.
[36:13] Hey, uncle, you are praying for me.
[36:16] You know there are no chances,
but miracles do happen.
[36:20] Hey, listen to one thing carefully,
[36:23] don’t call me again.
[36:26] Yes. Yes. Better.
Thank you.
[36:28] Goodbye.
[36:31] Here, it was just a game of two minutes,
I got it sorted.
[36:35] After today,
[36:36] you stay away from my matters.
Understand?
[36:39] If you talk to me like this,
[36:41] then I will call up Mr. Nizamuddin again.
[36:44] And you don’t know me,
[36:46] if I get stuck on something,
[36:49] the proposal is something ordinary,
[36:50] I will get you married by the evening.
Understand?
[36:53] Hey, then go get yourself married.
[36:55] Idiot.
Look at him.
[36:57] Instead of thanking me,
he is showing me attitude.
[37:01] Don’t mind, mama, you left a lot of lacking
in his upbringing.
[37:05] Now there is just one solution,
find a wife, who fixes him.
[37:11] Hey, it is really difficult
to find such a girl.
[37:14] Hey, leave that to me.
[37:16] I will find such a girl that
you will thank me.
[37:19] You will pray for me.
You will pray.
[37:20] He is so angry at you,
[37:23] that whatever proposal you bring,
he will never agree now.
[37:26] Leave him,
[37:27] everything will be done secretly.
[37:31] I will find the girl,
you take the credit, okay?
[37:39] Okay, then lets try.
Let’s try.
