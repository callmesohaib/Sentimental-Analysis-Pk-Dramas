[00:19] Father,
[00:21] father for God's sake.
[00:23] Don't test my patience.
[00:26] Go away.
[00:35] Aasia, for God's sake listen to me.
[00:43] The gate is open.
[01:21] Hurry up,
[01:24] I have to close the door.
[01:27] I am going, Aasia.
[01:30] I will go but I will return.
[01:35] I'll keep coming back
until you forgive me.
[01:58] Now that the evening is over
you're coming back,
[02:02] it's a little too late now.
[02:05] It's very late now,
[02:10] I waited for you carrying baby Rania,
[02:16] but you never returned.
[02:34] Sister, sister.
[02:36] Uncle she's not home.
[02:38] What? She should have been home,
where did she go?
[02:41] What happened,
you seem so happy?
[02:43] It is something to be happy about.
[02:45] Won’t you share it with me?
Yes, why not, why not.
[02:48] Then tell me.
[02:49] Actually the thing is,
even I don't know what it is.
[02:52] Laiba, I'm tired,
[02:56] please bring water for me fast.
[02:58] Yes mother, let me get it.
[03:02] Ayaz,
[03:04] you seem really happy.
[03:07] Yes sister, actually even
I don't know why am I so happy.
[03:11] Oh you.
[03:13] Sister, can we go to grandmother's house
for tea time?
[03:19] Why?
Did they invite us?
[03:20] No, neighbors don't have
such formalities.
[03:23] I just wanted to go.
[03:24] Okay, let's see.
[03:26] We won't see, let's go.
[03:28] Okay, let's go.
[03:29] No, we will go, sister.
Please, can I go and get ready?
[03:33] Thank you, thank you,
thank you, beloved sister.
[03:40] What happened to him?
[03:42] I don't know mother,
well leave him, tell me.
[03:46] When are we going to have an event
for brother Farhad?
[03:48] I want to invite so many
of my friends.
[03:51] My child, after we get done with Mona's event,
we will have our own.
[03:54] Well, I didn't see Farhad,
where is he?
[03:57] Brother went out for some errands.
[04:01] I've taken out some clothes for the tea time,
how does it look?
[04:06] What are you preparing for?
It has a lot of checks.
[04:08] I will look a little boyish in this one.
No, no.
[04:13] What happened to you?
What are you preparing for?
[04:15] Sister, we have to go on
in the evening.
[04:17] Yes.
[04:18] You should also get ready then
we will go in the evening okay?
[04:22] We have to go, okay?
[04:40] Rabail.
Yes?
[04:41] Where is that witch?
[04:42] Who is the witch?
Who are you talking about?
[04:44] Dude, we only have one witch
at our place, Rania.
[04:47] Where is she?
[04:48] It's such a bad thing, calling
a nice girl a witch.
[04:51] And anyway, she is arguing with grandmother
and aunt Asma about the current situations.
[04:56] Okay then it's fine.
Listen,
[04:58] can you come to a shopping mall with me?
Please, please, please.
[05:00] No I don't have to shop.
You have to shop with me.
[05:04] Why would I shop for you,
I don't know anything about boys.
[05:06] Not for boys stupid, listen to
the whole sentence.
[05:09] We have to buy some things
for that Rania.
[05:11] You just got her clothes.
[05:14] It was just one dress,
[05:16] there are so many events
at our house,
[05:17] she won't be wearing the same dress
in all the events.
[05:19] That's why, let's go.
[05:20] Oh, why do you suddenly
care about her?
[05:25] Whatever you are thinking,
there is nothing like that.
[05:28] I'm only doing this
because she's an idiot,
[05:33] if we don't buy her dresses
[05:35] then she'll wear
whatever she feels like,
[05:37] and who will be insulted? Us.
[05:41] That's why. And anyway,
[05:43] she's grandmother's
only brother's only grandchild,
[05:46] that's her right.
[05:48] Oh so this is what it is?
[05:50] That's exactly what it is.
[05:51] And listen,
[05:53] whatever girls wear
at the weddings,
[05:55] like sandals, jewelry,
bangles and whatnot.
[05:59] Get all the stuff.
[06:01] But don't tell her that
I bought her all that stuff,
[06:05] she'll show off later, okay?
[06:08] Okay, get the car out,
[06:10] I will come right back after
giving this to grandmother.
[06:11] Yes, yes.
[06:13] The clothes are ironed.
[06:18] Enough my daughter, live long,
stay happy, stay happy.
[06:23] Bebo, my child,
[06:25] tell me how is my brother?
[06:28] What is he doing after retirement?
[06:33] Whenever I call him
he says only one thing.
[06:38] Sister, I'm occupied
with a lot of things,
[06:41] what business he has started?
[06:45] Oh, Aunt, there is no business,
[06:48] people come to him with their problems
[06:51] and that's what keeps him busy all day.
[06:54] Okay, okay.
[06:56] This princess of mine,
she's exactly like her grandfather.
[07:01] She is such a lovely girl.
[07:05] Aunt, stop, please stop,
she'll catch an attitude.
[07:09] Appreciation is rightly deserved
she is such a nice girl,
[07:14] so pious, so kind, right?
[07:18] I'll pray to God to make her
more fortunate.
[07:22] She stays happy
wherever she goes.
[07:25] Ameen.
[07:27] Let it be, grandmother, let's talk
about something else.
[07:31] Where is uncle?
[07:33] He, ever since he has returned
it seems like he came out of a prison.
[07:41] So happy, so delighted,
[07:43] he's here or there all day,
just like a little child.
[07:55] God's forgiveness,
what have you done?
[07:59] Seems like nobody even touched it
for the last 20 years.
[08:03] Hey, hey dumb-head,
[08:05] tell me one thing, what do you do
all day idle person?
[08:10] Maintain it somewhat.
[08:12] And listen, Seema was telling me that
you have managed the whole house.
[08:16] That's how you manage the house?
[08:18] Oh brother, what happened?
These are not the chores for us to do.
[08:23] That Shehenshah, him, he'll do it.
[08:26] Come here, come on.
I'll do it?
[08:29] I was just water for you today
that is big deal,
[08:31] mother has strictly forbidden me
to do anything today, I'll only study.
[08:35] Don't tell her she will
take away my iPhone.
[08:39] Here you go,
[08:41] did you see his shoes,
[08:43] they looked better than my face.
[08:46] You're here acting like a Nawab's son
[08:49] and there I'm being a
donkey's son for 20 years.
[08:53] Really? No, no, brother,
what happened?
[08:55] You are getting emotional,
there is nothing like that brother.
[08:57] How am I emotional,
what are you saying?
[08:59] Hammad?
What? Hammad.
[09:01] What are you doing here?
For what did I send you?
[09:04] I waited for you for so long
then did it myself.
[09:07] Oh, I, I, actually I forgot.
[09:10] Where is your focus?
That you forgot my thing.
[09:14] I'm noticing your behavior.
[09:16] There is no change in behavior
I'm just going to do your work.
[09:20] I'm going.
[09:21] Then do it fast.
I'm going.
[09:25] Oh God.
[09:27] Your wife insulted you in front of
your older brother.
[09:32] And you kept doing
"I, I, this, that"
[09:38] You've disgraced us
in the whole family.
[09:41] Slave of your wife.
No brother I.
[09:44] "No, I, this, that"
[09:47] Sister-in-law Sweetie?
Pay my regards to her.
[09:51] How do I pay your regards,
I haven't even answered the call yet.
[09:54] Be patient.
[09:59] Hello, darling Sweetie,
how are you?
[10:03] Where have you been?
[10:04] Why haven't you been
answering my phone?
[10:07] That, I, that, that, I.
[10:11] It has been ringing for so long,
I'm tired of calling you,
[10:14] why didn't you answer?
[10:15] Sweetie, that's what I've been
meaning to tell you,
[10:18] I was in the bathroom.
[10:21] Everyone is in the same situation,
[10:24] whether it's America or Pakistan.
[10:26] Wives have the same ways
everywhere.
[10:30] Brother.
[10:31] Whenever I call you,
you're in the bathroom,
[10:34] is your stomach alright?
[10:35] Yes, yes, my stomach is quite alright.
[10:39] Nothing wrong with it,
I was just generally unwell.
[10:43] I'm unwell, I'll talk to you later,
I have to go to the bathroom again.
[10:48] That's what you get for running
away like this.
[10:50] Listen, if you're that sick then
come back, come right back.
[10:55] Sweetie, how can I return?
Mother isn't well either,
[10:59] I have to look after her and
take her to the hospital,
[11:02] you know how costly medicines
are in Pakistan.
[11:05] I was saying, Sweetie,
please send some money.
[11:16] She's getting stingy.
[11:21] Brother do you know
what we used to think?
[11:23] That you're a millionaire in America.
But you are.
[11:31] Thank God,
[11:32] he gave you a chance to talk about
something today, idle.
[11:39] Leave, and go,
go do your wife's work.
[12:07] My child it's 4:00 pm and there are
no traces of tea in this house.
[12:12] Grandmother,
there are still 4 minutes left in 4,
[12:15] you'll get the tea by 4,
[12:17] I've given special instructions
to Shehenshah.
[12:20] Mother.
[12:21] Yes.
[12:22] Where are you coming from?
[12:24] I'm taking Mona to a salon
for a facial.
[12:26] Yeah, take her it might
make a difference.
[12:29] Mother.
[12:33] Now what?
[12:34] Mother nothing is for free,
so for facial.
[12:37] Whenever you appear
it's to get money.
[12:43] Here you go.
[12:50] Here.
[12:51] Give some extra,
I'll also get some.
[12:56] Here, now that's enough.
[12:57] Thank you, bye.
[13:00] Oh, wow, our special guests just arrived.
[13:03] Greetings.
Greetings.
[13:05] How are you?
Greetings. Greetings.
[13:07] Welcome uncle, do you know
our village had a similar habit,
[13:10] people used to come over
whenever they want.
[13:12] Sit, sit, sit, sit.
[13:13] Take a seat, take a seat.
[13:16] How are you?
[13:18] We haven't been seeing Farhad lately,
where does he go?
[13:21] He has been staying busier now,
[13:24] I'll convey your message,
he'll come to meet you.
[13:28] Bebo,
[13:38] hurry, hurry.
[13:39] Look who's here,
Rabail's in-laws,
[13:42] Farhad's mother and
this is Farhad's uncle.
[13:45] And this is my aunt, Bebo.
[13:47] But everyone says
she looks like my sister.
[13:51] People are right.
[13:54] You didn't tell,
you were aunt's close relative?
[13:59] Why didn't you tell,
you are Rania's Bebo?
[14:04] Wait a second, wait a second,
you both know each other already?
[14:09] But how?
[14:10] That is a long story.
[14:15] Now I have to get to know this story.
[14:18] It looks like you both know each other
for a very long time,
[14:22] were you class-fellows in school?
[14:24] It's not like this but it feels like this.
[14:32] Tea?
[14:33] Shehenshah.
[14:40] Your Instagram id?
[14:44] Lonely_bebo.
[14:48] And yours?
I love you too.
[15:00] Greetings little master.
Greetings.
[15:03] Should I serve the dinner for you?
[15:04] No, no, not yet, in a while.
[15:07] Tell me, has father returned?
[15:09] He returned a few minutes ago,
[15:11] but since he has returned,
he's really quiet,
[15:13] and he said no to dinner as well.
[15:17] Okay,
[15:19] I'll see.
okay.
[15:26] Hey Rabail, stop.
Yes?
[15:30] Give this to Rania,
[15:32] but she can never find out that
I bought this for her.
[15:36] I know very well,
she won't find out.
[15:38] If she gets to know
she won't accept these gifts.
[15:41] Okay that's it, now go, go.
[15:57] What is happening madam?
[15:58] I'm repairing the buttons
on uncle Dabeer's shirt,
[16:00] where were you since the morning,
didn't it take a little too long to shop?
[16:03] Look at what I've bought.
[16:05] Okay, show me.
Look at this, I'll see this.
[16:11] Oh wow,
[16:13] this is such a beautiful dress Rabail,
it'll suit you.
[16:15] And this one?
How will it look on you?
[16:18] These both are the same.
[16:20] Yes, one for me,
one for you.
[16:23] What? Rabail, no.
Rania, please don't say no,
[16:27] I have shopped with
so much love for you,
[16:29] if you reject it,
I will be heartbroken.
[16:31] Rabail, they must be very expensive.
[16:34] I'm telling you,
I'll be heartbroken if you say no.
[16:37] Okay, then I'll take this.
[16:40] Well how did you know
it's my favorite color?
[16:46] Because I knew this colour
will look good on you.
[16:50] Does that mean
we will wear the same dress?
[16:52] Yes.
Yay.
[16:54] Okay go and try it fast,
let me know does it fit you?
[16:56] Yes, I will go and try.
[17:01] Well, Rania and brother Mahir
have completely opposite mindsets,
[17:06] but they go so well together.
[17:09] God, whatever I’m thinking,
please make it happen,
[17:12] Ameen.
[17:17] Now pick up the spoon.
[17:21] And stir it.
[17:22] And stir it.
[17:24] Inside the pot.
[17:28] Yes, in the pot.
[17:31] Hey,
[17:33] sister, sister, what are you doing,
everything alright?
[17:38] I can only cook in the kitchen
I won’t be ironing the clothes.
[17:42] Oh, you’re getting witty,
you’re giving answers.
[17:47] Ayaz, tell me why you’re here,
stop spinning it all.
[17:55] Okay, potato aubergine?
Good.
[17:57] Sister, Rania’s aunt is here
[18:00] so why don’t we invite her over
for the snacks and tea.
[18:04] Tea?
Yes.
[18:05] Ayaz, isn’t this tea getting
important for you?
[18:08] Yesterday you went there
for the tea,
[18:10] now you want to invite her
for the tea.
[18:13] If you’re Rania’s aunt it means
you’re like my aunt as well,
[18:16] come have a seat, please.
You’re right.
[18:19] Yes, yes, please, have a seat,
be comfortable.
[18:23] Please, I’ll call mother.
[18:25] Mother, mother.
[18:28] Hey mother.
[18:30] Uncle?
[18:32] I could smell a soft fragrance,
[18:34] what a beautiful co-incidence,
[18:37] I was just talking about you
to my sister.
[18:39] Sister was saying Rania’s aunt is here
[18:43] so we should invite her to dinner or tea,
sister you were saying, right?
[18:46] Yes, yes, yes.
Greetings. Greetings.
[18:49] Have a seat,
[18:50] you should’ve brought
Rania along too.
[18:52] Actually I was just getting
some sunlight in the garden,
[18:56] Farhad forced me to come.
[18:58] Sunlight and heat aren’t made for you,
[19:00] for you there are shadows,
relaxing environments,
[19:04] valleys, sparrows,
some place in Europe.
[19:09] You have European features,
even after being from a village.
[19:12] Well our Rabail is really fortunate,
[19:15] that she got all of you as in-laws.
[19:17] You people are really nice.
[19:20] Thank you, thank you, actually,
do I make tea for you?
[19:25] No, no.
[19:26] Ayaz, why would you make the tea,
tell Laiba to make it.
[19:31] Sister, sister, I do all the house chores,
so I can make tea as well, what’s a big deal?
[19:35] And she’ll make a really bad tea,
I’ll make it myself.
[19:39] And I won’t give you a chance
to complain about it, ever.
[19:44] I’ll be back, be here, don’t go.
[19:47] Keep her occupied.
[19:50] Tea, tea, tea.
[19:52] Hot water.
Potato aubergine?
[19:55] Water, water, water.
[20:02] Yes, then sugar.
[20:09] Now what? Tea leaves.
[20:15] Hey uncle that’s spices.
Spices.
[20:16] I think you’ll burn the dish of your hopes
with your own hands.
[20:21] Hey Farhad, I’m getting nervous
in happiness,
[20:23] I’m losing my senses in tension,
what is happening to me, what is this?
[20:28] I’ll tell you the name of this disease later.
[20:30] As of now, listen to me,
[20:33] your special guest is outside,
give her the company.
[20:40] She must be waiting for me.
[20:42] Asma, I’m coming.
[20:44] Darling Asma,
I’m coming.
[20:51] What happened,
is it ready?
[20:54] No, no, sister,
Farhad is preparing the tea.
[20:55] Farhad was telling me that
a guest is like an angel
[20:59] but you’re not an angel.
[21:05] What is it,
[21:07] why are you smiling so much?
[21:08] He must’ve remembered a joke.
Yes.
[21:12] Tell us the joke.
[21:13] A man used to fall from
the other side of his bed,
[21:15] so how did it stop?
[21:19] His family got him married.
[21:25] Double bed, you know,
double bed.
[21:27] An elephant got a speeding ticket,
[21:29] so the driver was revealed,
it was an ant.
[21:38] An elephant and his girlfriend
were having sushi.
[21:42] Elephants are vegetarian.
[21:45] It seems like you really like elephants.
[21:48] No, no, not me, my friend.
[21:50] My friend wrote a book,
elephant, my partner.
[21:52] He lives near the book market,
[21:54] the book is in my library
if you want to see.
[22:04] Mother stop moving for God’s sake.
Enough.
[22:08] Put on this lip gloss.
[22:10] Okay.
[22:11] I’m going to pick up Mona
from the parlor,
[22:12] its getting late she’ll start crying.
Okay okay, you should go.
[22:15] Bye.
[22:17] Mother,
[22:19] mother, it’s getting late and
you’re still getting ready.
[22:22] Such long preparation.
[22:24] I think the groom’s side will arrive
[22:26] and we won’t even be ready.
[22:30] What do you think about yourself?
[22:31] What do I think mother?
I’m ready, absolutely ready.
[22:35] That’s your preparations?
Old pants and an ugly shirt on it?
[22:39] Mother, you people are nawabs,
[22:42] I’m a labor, hardworking man.
[22:45] That’s how you dress in America,
you can go anywhere,
[22:49] people don’t make new dresses for years,
whatever you wear.
[22:53] It’s absolutely alright,
I’ll go like this.
[22:57] What do you mean, we should
also be careless like them?
[23:00] Are you forgetting
what parent’s son you are?
[23:04] Go and wear a nice suit,
did you bring a suit along?
[23:08] I, I, I did bring it.
Go wear it.
[23:11] Mother I get suffocated in a suit,
it looks fine, let it be.
[23:19] Okay mother I’ll wear it.
[23:22] Well mother,
I’ll sacrifice in your name,
[23:25] you look like Queen Elizabeth
in this getup.
[23:30] I want to pay my respect to you.
[23:32] Greetings, greetings queen Elizabeth.
[23:36] Stop now go.
[23:38] Okay listen to me, listen to me, come here,
come sit here I need to talk.
[23:41] Yes mother, tell me, tell me.
[23:43] We have to give a heavy
amount of money to the groom,
[23:46] and while you’re giving it,
make a video.
[23:51] So in case anyone denies it
in the future,
[23:53] we’d have a proof to show them
to their faces.
[24:03] Yes, Basheer, do I look perfect?
[24:06] Yes, royalty, today the thunder of your beauty
will burn alot of people.
[24:12] What heavy moustaches
Shakeel gave to me.
[24:16] Sir, I think these moustaches might
weigh heavier than you, leave it.
[24:21] Why do I leave it?
[24:23] I’m getting this look
after putting them on.
[24:26] You’ll see, my in-laws must be impatiently
grieving for me at this time.
[24:32] Sir grief is for the funeral.
[24:43] Wow, wow, wow,
it’s marvellous, right mother?
[24:49] It’s an excellent arrangement.
[24:51] Father, it’s my choice,
how can it be not excellent?
[24:54] Very nice, very nice.
[24:56] Come on mother,
let’s meet the guests.
[24:58] Come on.
[25:02] Hey, stop, stop, stop.
Wow, same dresses.
[25:06] You both look beautiful.
[25:08] Come on, come on, come on.
Rabail, listen, listen,
[25:10] grandmother was looking for you,
she went this side.
[25:13] Okay.
[25:13] I’ll come with you.
Stop, stop, where are you going?
[25:16] There?
[25:17] It’s time for groom’s family to arrive.
[25:19] Stay here with me to welcome them.
[25:20] Groom’s family is coming? Did they call?
[25:22] Yes, yes, yes, I got a call.
[25:24] Okay then we’ll stay here.
Yes.
[25:32] Hey, greetings.
Greetings.
[25:35] Greetings.
[25:36] Where is Farhad,
he didn’t come?
[25:38] Yes, he couldn’t make it due to work
but he’s missing the event.
[25:43] Oh, okay, you should come inside.
[25:45] Come on.
[25:47] Wait, stop, dupatta,
it’s an expensive dress.
[25:52] God, my back hurts sitting there
for so long.
[25:57] And you didn’t have a better car
to pick me up?
[26:00] You came with a car
that didn’t have the AC.
[26:03] It was so hot.
[26:05] You’re ungrateful, 
I paid by myself,
[26:08] do you understand, there was a
discount on non-AC cars.
[26:11] Okay everything is alright,
but it’s too hot,
[26:13] order a chilled juice for me, fresh.
[26:18] Mona, do I look like a waiter that
you’re demanding juice?
[26:24] Stay quiet, I’m upset.
[26:25] I requested mother to give me
some family jewelry,
[26:30] I got nothing, I’m wearing all artificial,
does it look obvious?
[26:36] Sorry, poor man’s wives are
like that. Poor.
[26:42] Mona if you say something
like that again,
[26:44] I won’t consider you a bride,
[26:47] I’ll slap you across the face
with my sandals.
[26:52] Greetings.
[26:55] Even the AC aren’t working,
[26:56] there is nothing like my standards here father,
nothing is settled father.
[27:01] I’ll.
[27:02] Not so soon, not now,
well handle him later.
[27:07] God, I’ll die,
I mean wow.
[27:10] You’ve got a look.
[27:13] Liar will rot in hell,
aunt, careful.
[27:17] Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[27:23] Look, look, look, look at this walk,
how he’s strutting.
[27:29] My blood is boiling and
you’re smiling?
[27:32] I’m smiling on what
Mona is going to do to him.
[27:35] Look at him, how he put on fake moustaches,
he looks like a cartoon.
[27:39] Obviously not everyone
can be smart,
[27:42] handsome, and intelligent like me,
right Salik?
[27:45] People are delusional,
[27:47] this Khawar is a thousand times
better than you.
[27:50] What?
[27:51] This chimpanzee?
Better than me?
[27:53] Is your mind in the right place?
[27:55] Actually I didn’t want to tell the truth,
but you just said,
[27:58] liars will go to hell,
so I have to tell the truth.
[28:27] Your brother-in-law could’ve gotten
a proper sleep at least today.
[28:31] God’s forgiveness,
I’m the one sitting next to you,
[28:33] in such expensive makeup.
[28:35] How beautiful do I look
[28:37] and instead of looking at me,
you are looking at other people?
[28:39] Look at me and don’t look
at anyone else except me.
[28:45] This enemy of mine,
[28:47] I feel like getting him
thrown out of the hall.
[28:50] Who?
[28:51] Is he looking at me
or is he looking at you?
[28:52] He is looking at you.
[28:55] Oh, this Mahir.
[28:56] Do you know this Mahir did not
want me to get married in this family,
[29:00] did not want me to be the son-in-law
of this house.
[29:02] Oh, so you also found out,
[29:04] But why is he looking at me like this?
[29:06] he wanted to marry me, I rejected.
[29:09] But he was still after me for a few days
and now that I am getting married to you,
[29:15] he is getting jealous.
Jealous.
[29:18] I don’t know what happened to him.
[29:20] Ignore him, we should take
our pictures, come on.
[29:24] Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
[29:35] Rania.
What?
[29:37] Why is this Khawar staring
at me like this? Look.
[29:41] Really,
[29:43] his arrogance isn’t getting
better today.
[29:53] Do one thing,
[29:55] arrange a pedestal fan fast, and
a packet of chewing gum as well.
[29:59] Pedestal fan,
chewing gum? Why?
[30:02] Subhan, I get it that the bride
and groom are important
[30:05] but the actual beauty is standing here.
[30:06] Please take a nice picture of us.
[30:08] And send me as a
WhatsApp document, okay?
[30:11] My that angle doesn’t look good,
take from this angle.
[30:18] Are you only going
to take our pictures?
[30:20] There is bride and groom,
get theirs as well.
[30:26] By the way,
[30:28] how did you like our arrangements?
[30:31] It’s good.
Thank you, thank you.
[30:33] But do you know?
[30:35] At our place,
[30:37] we have a set up on the street
and manage all the events.
[30:41] And here, such a small event
and so much waste of money.
[30:47] It’s good to know that
you’re simple like me.
[30:52] A little.
[30:53] A little?
[30:55] You look so cute speaking that.
[31:02] Rania?
Yes.
[31:04] It looks like he has a cervical issue,
[31:07] look at how stiff his neck is.
[31:10] He's stiff like this
since he arrived.
[31:13] It’s not a cervical problem,
it's a wealth problem.
[31:17] Rich men sit with their necks
straight like this.
[31:21] But he's not a rich man,
[31:23] actually he doesn't seem like a man at all,
he looks like a pet bird to me.
[31:33] Here I got it.
[31:35] Found the pedestal fan, but finding
this chewing gum was really difficult.
[31:38] Really? Give it to me.
What's the plan?
[31:41] Nothing, get it plugged in, go.
[31:42] Chewing gum?
[31:43] Chewing gum is to chew.
[31:45] Plug it in.
Plug, plug, plug.
[31:47] Come on, come, bring it here.
[31:48] Place it here.
[31:50] Yes I'm bringing.
[31:52] The groom is getting hot
for so long.
[31:54] Poor man, place it right
in front of his face.
[31:56] He should get the air
on this face.
[31:58] Plug it, plug it, plug it Salik.
[31:59] Brother-in-law, switch on the fan,
it's too hot.
[32:01] Yes, I'll plug it.
[32:26] If we cover his head he'll
look prettier than the girl.
[32:43] That's how we get the revenge.
[32:56] Pick it up, pick it up Dabeer.
[32:58] Before I run out of patience.
[33:02] What happened aunt?
[33:03] Don't talk to me right now,
I'm really angry.
[33:06] Okay.
[33:07] Dabeer isn't answering the call.
[33:09] How dare he? I call him
and he doesn't answer.
[33:13] Well, I understand the tricks of in-laws.
[33:16] I'm also Pakistani not
an American girl.
[33:20] I'm thinking to go to Pakistan
and tell my in-laws.
[33:27] Come on aunt.
[33:29] My village blood is boiling.
[33:33] Do one thing, arrange my ticket.
[33:38] Listen, you dare tell anything
to uncle Dabeer.
[33:42] You're my brother's daughter,
you're like a child to me,
[33:46] so you'll favor me, understand?
[33:51] Aunt but like this?
[33:56] I returned after 20 years
[33:58] but I feel like everything is the same.
Nothing changed.
[34:01] Brother we're getting family pictures,
they're calling you.
[34:06] Okay, you go I'll come.
Coming, coming, coming.
[34:10] Excuse me brother Nasir,
wait a minute.
[34:14] Hello?
[34:15] Yes, yes, yes sweetie?
[34:21] Come on Mr. Groom, smile,
act like a cute cat.
[34:28] Hey, he can be a cat but
being cute is very difficult.
[34:36] Picture, picture, picture.
[34:39] 3, 2, 1, cheese.
[34:48] One more, one more, one more.
1, 2, 3, smile.
[35:04] Dr. Wasiq,
[35:09] you're so late, I've been waiting
for you for so long.
[35:12] Your father didn't come?
I told you to bring him along.
[35:16] Actually I did convey
your message to father
[35:18] but he wasn't really well
so he couldn't come.
[35:22] He's unwell?
[35:23] What happened to him?
Let me talk to him.
[35:25] Oh, no, no he isn't even that sick,
[35:27] you should enjoy this
event peacefully.
[35:30] You can come to our place,
you can meet him there.
[35:34] Okay I'll visit tomorrow
to meet him.
[35:39] Okay now come I'll introduce you
to everyone.
[35:41] Yes, please.
Come on.
[35:53] Congratulations, congratulations,
congratulations to both of you.
[35:58] We're done with the ceremony.
[36:07] Bring your hand forward.
[36:11] Congratulations.
[36:21] Here, look at this pure 10 tolas.
[36:26] 10 tolas?
We've started this as well?
[36:36] Life with me is a life of luxury.
[36:39] Are you seeing this?
[36:41] Showering her with gold
even before the marriage.
[36:43] And then there is me,
generational daughter-in-law.
[36:46] I long for the smallest things.
[36:53] Hey, you didn't take anything?
[36:55] Your plate is empty.
I'll get it, no I'll get it.
[36:59] I'm eating it.
No, no, I'll get it.
[37:05] Kebabs, fish kebabs.
[37:09] Qorma is delicious.
[37:10] No, no, I.
It’s delicious.
[37:15] Have it.
[37:16] I can’t eat all of it.
[37:18] Taste it, take the fish kebabs,
here, here.
[37:22] This, this is fish kebab, have it.
[37:29] I’d only heard it till now that people
of Lahore are really welcoming,
[37:33] I’m witnessing it now.
[37:34] People of Lahore are very loving,
[37:38] I mean when you live here you’ll realize
what I am trying to say.
[37:46] Can I ask you something
if you don’t mind?
[37:52] Do you have high standards?
[37:55] Or low standards?
Or something in the middle?
[37:58] What do you even mean?
I couldn’t understand.
[38:00] I mean to ask, how can someone
reject a beautiful girl like you,
[38:06] I’m sure you must’ve kicked off
everyone, right?
[38:09] I can’t even understand,
I don’t get it.
[38:13] You’re absolutely right.
[38:16] I don’t have high standards,
[38:19] but I hate selfish
and greedy people.
[38:24] You’re right.
[38:26] Do you know, all the proposals
I got till now,
[38:29] all of them asked father, of his house,
properties, business, all of it.
[38:36] Like there is no value for humans,
[38:39] I really don’t like such people.
[38:41] What a pious thinking you have,
[38:44] the world is getting so materialistic,
[38:47] people are hating other people
on the basis of their wealth.
[38:50] People are greedy,
[38:52] people are enemies of other people, right?
[38:55] Have this, this qorma is delicious.
[38:58] I’ve heard you haven’t married yet either,
[39:02] so would you like to tell the reason?
[39:10] Actually,
[39:12] we have almost similar stories.
[39:17] I’ve sent proposals,
they ask what does the guy do?
[39:21] Whether or not he has a government job,
[39:23] will he give a car to the girl,
does he have a green card or not.
[39:26] Then it gets stuck on the fact that
[39:29] I live at my sister’s house and
she got it from her company.
[39:32] I don’t understand
what answer would they like.
[39:37] Do you know,
[39:38] I feel like the world isn’t made
for people like you and me.
[39:43] Point.
[39:44] We should’ve been born way earlier,
[39:48] when there was a value of a good human,
piousness, morality.
[39:55] You’re right,
[39:56] but when you’re really dedicated do you
end up finding what you want.
