[00:20] Her Mother-in-law treats her like a maid
[00:23] at least the maids get paid for their work
[00:26] I don’t get that either
[00:27] But I have always told her to be patient
[00:34] Your sun will someday rise
[00:36] But Mian Sahab it’s gone way too far,
[00:39] this time her mother-in-law threw her 
out of the house over nothing
[00:42] And her husband just stood 
there watching
[00:45] oh,
[00:46] that’s not good
[00:47] Please talk to them
[00:49] I am a widow, who do I plead to?
[00:51] Please ask them to take her back
[00:54] Mian Sahab, I don’t think we should coax
 and cajole such barbaric people.
[00:58] You wouldn't understand the cruel ways 
of society, you are only a kid.
[01:04] Rani, go to the kitchen
[01:05] and help Bebo prepare dinner.
[01:08] These people need me 
more than Bebo does.
[01:10] Sister, listen to me.
[01:12] Your brother must have sisters.
I mean, you must have sisters-in-law.
[01:15] yes, I do,
[01:16] she’s married and well-pampered 
by my husband and Mother-in-law
[01:19] They'd freak out 
if she was pierced by a thorn,
[01:22] but they don't mind if I'm crushed 
beneath mountains of problems.
[01:26] there you go aunt
[01:28] You just ask our permission
[01:30] and go cry your heart out at 
her husband’s sister’s in-laws’ house
[01:34] about the hell those people 
put your daughter through
[01:40] They'll get a taste of their own medicine.
[01:42] When their own daughter is humiliated
[01:44] by her in-laws for her mother's treatment 
of your daughter
[01:47] Mian Sahab, please stop her
[01:50] she’s adding fuel to the fire.
[01:53] Mian Sahab I think your granddaughter
 is absolutely right!
[01:57] Why didn’t you think 
of this before?
[01:59] let’s go mother, 
to Tamanna’s house
[02:01] I am going to cry a river 
about their injustice to me
[02:04] Yes exactly, spice it up 
and exaggerate
[02:08] I’ll do just that
[02:09] Thank you, Mian Sahab!
[02:11] listen be reasonable there’s 
no need to go feral
[02:16] Absolutely, keep your cool 
and have fun with it.
[02:18] There is no reason 
to become enraged.
[02:21] Sitting around moping 
doesn't always work;
[02:24] sometimes you have to take a stand.
[02:28] Alright, I will keep you updated 
on everything.
[02:30] Gooday Mian Sahab!
[02:32] Let’s go
goodbye!
[02:34] No wait, don’t do that.
[02:38] Come over here
What did you just do?
[02:41] Mother it’s not like I did something wrong
[02:43] Listen here, you little “Savior 
of the Oppressed."
[02:46] Why did you have to put ideas 
into their heads
[02:49] They were here to ask 
Mian Sahab’s opinion;
[02:51] why did you have to intervene
[02:52] It's my responsibility to help those 
who have been wronged.
[02:54] Now, aren't you 
the princess of the people?
[02:57] I'm telling you, Mian Sahab,
[02:59] you need to send her to Lahore.
[03:01] Call your sister and send her there.
[03:03] She has to enroll in a university,
[03:06] or else her shenanigans will taint 
your name across the village.
[03:14] Tell me, why did you have to stick your nose 
into someone else’s business?
[03:18] Lahore?
[03:19] Yes, ma’am Lahore!
[03:21] Only then you’ll get your act together
[03:23] when you have to study all the time without 
the comfort of a home away from all this drama
[03:30] Only then you’ll get some sense,
[03:31] Send her away. Mian Sahab. Call your 
sister and send her away!
[03:36] Oh,
[03:38] so you’ll go to Lahore,
[03:40] study,
[03:42] and eventually become 
the prime minister
[03:45] Who can say no to you Mian Sahab
[03:48] You can send me wherever you want
[03:51] listen to me
[03:53] This is your own house;
[03:56] we are all here for you
[04:00] but now you are going to someone 
else’s house and you have to be careful
[04:06] Your mother is scared of you
[04:09] and all the stunts and pranks that you pull.
She’s afraid of your bravery.
[04:16] She wants you to be a 
non-threatening person
[04:20] Do you think you can be 
that person?
[04:22] No?
[04:26] All right, then talk to your sister.
[04:28] Yes, I will do that.
[04:33] Lahore, get ready; 
I am coming!
[04:37] Yay!
[04:42] yes!
[04:44] look, this will go straight in.
[04:49] "Uncle, get up; it’s your turn.
[04:51] uncle, what are you doing?
[04:55] Man, did it go in?
[04:56] yes!
[04:58] “Uncle’s planning on breaking 
all records of laziness anyway.
[05:01] hello everyone, listen to this
[05:03] and keep it in your mind
[05:07] that I have spent my whole life trying 
to build name for this family
[05:15] Which is why all my relatives not 
only respect but also trust as well
[05:22] Take my cousin, 
Anwar ahmed for example;
[05:25] his granddaughter is coming from 
Khushhaal Pur to lahore for her studies,
[05:29] and Anwar contacted me to wish his 
desire to have her stay at our house
[05:33] while she’s here I don’t want her to go 
through any troubles here at all
[05:37] coming from Khushhal Pur 
to Lahore for studies?
[05:39] Tell her to stay where she is
[05:41] Education cannot change 
these small town people
[05:45] you shouldn’t say that,
[05:47] actually, these small town people are
more passionate and driven
[05:50] listen to me.
[05:52] You two can argue later, 
let me finish what I was saying first
[05:56] This girl is like my own granddaughter
[05:59] and well-pampered by Anwar
[06:01] Now that my father has 
sadly passed away,
[06:06] I want to rebuild my relationship 
with my brother.
[06:12] Oh, so now we have to coddle a guest 
who wasn’t even invited?
[06:15] What's your issue?
[06:17] Are we feeding her through your money?
[06:19] but Mother-in-law that wasn’t my intention
I understand all your intentions
[06:23] Rabail Let me tell you,
[06:25] she is around your age,
[06:27] so take care of her, okay?
Treat her like a friend,
[06:30] I don’t want you all fighting her thinking 
she’s just some simple girl;
[06:33] Yes, I understand; 
don’t you worry.
[06:35] I also have some good news.
[06:38] what?
[06:41] My sister, Mona, is coming to stay.
[06:42] OH, thank God!
[06:44] As if one wasn’t enough.
[06:54] the house will be so quiet without her.
[06:58] exactly!
[07:00] I was ranting in frustration,
[07:03] but Mian Sahab took it seriously.
[07:06] And look at this girl, so excited 
and happy.
[07:09] I always intended to pursue 
my education in a big city.
[07:15] Don’t worry I’ll come back as soon as
 my studies are finished, I won’t stay there
[07:19] Is everything ready?
[07:22] I will take you there myself
[07:24] Why would you go?
[07:26] I am not a child and Lahore is right
 around the corner
[07:28] It'll only take twenty minutes 
on the bus,
[07:30] and I have a phone as well;
 if there's any problem,
[07:32] I'll call you right away.
[07:34] And didn't you have to appear 
in court with Uncle Manzoor?
[07:38] Getting his land back is far more 
important than dropping me off.
[07:41] Hey, listen.
[07:43] I have memorized Mother’s address as well 
I’ll be fine don’t worry
[07:46] That's fine, but listen to me,
[07:50] and please act like a normal person 
when you're there.
[07:54] Mian Sahab, are you listening to her?
[07:56] I am right,
[07:58] just don’t say anything stupid 
and give me a hug
[08:00] Don’t be absurd; eat on time, 
and don’t start any drama.
[08:05] mother, please take care of my bike
[08:07] you take care as well.
[08:11] Mian Sahab.
[08:15] Bye Bebo
[08:17] keep an eye out for someone 
handsome
[08:20] I am going to study.
Woman, I am saying for myself.
[08:22] Okay Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[08:40] Dilawar’s wedding will 
forever be remembered
[08:42] You are absolutely right
[08:45] we really enjoyed ourselves,
 didn't we?
[08:48] The food was amazing, 
and so was the dancing,
[08:51] except for this foot fracture.
[08:54] And you kept me for a few extra days,
[08:57] and now my grandma in Lahore 
is upset with me because of you.
[09:02] Grandma will be fine once 
she sees your face
[09:05] and Real men don't care 
about these little injuries
[09:08] Yes, you are correct;
[09:10] now get me back to Lahore 
as soon as possible.
[09:12] Are you sure this piece of junk 
will get to Lahore?
[09:15] Brother, this isn’t a car, 
it's a jet."
[09:18] We'll be in Lahore in no time, 
so relax.
[09:22] Well, then speed up;
[09:25] woah, what happened?
[09:34] What happened, sir?
[09:37] I think the bus broke down
[09:39] Try again; it might work.
[09:44] Did you have to die on me now?
[09:47] ugh!
[09:49] I had to reach Lahore.
[09:51] Ma'am, please exit the bus.
[09:54] Quickly! Quickly!
[09:55] what happened? 
Where is everyone going?
[09:58] ma’am didn't you hear? 
The bus broke down.
[10:01] what?
[10:02] there’s a workshop right 
around the corner,
[10:04] let’s take the car there
[10:06] Man, are you of your mind?
[10:07] Look at my leg, it’s injured. 
How will I push this car?
[10:10] And I don’t have time; 
I have to get to Lahore.
[10:12] you said this bus will fly us to Lahore
in a few minutes like an airplane
[10:16] Ma'am, be reasonable;
do planes not malfunction?
[10:19] Get off the bus and 
get another one
[10:22] I'll have to take the bus now;
[10:24] give me my bag.
[10:26] And You!
[10:28] you should add some money and 
trade this piece of junk for bicycle,
[10:30] that’ll be more reliable than this
[10:32] I have never been on a bus 
my whole life,
[10:34] and now I have to 
because of you.
[10:36] How far is it?
[10:38] just a few steps.
Take care of yourself
[10:40] yeah yeah
[10:41] and call us when you get there
okay
[10:44] Tell me something, can't you people 
examine the vehicle before hitting the road?
[10:47] You have wasted so much time 
and ruined my journey
[10:51] God knows when
 I'll get to Lahore.
[10:53] ma’am I’d be very grateful if you could 
please continue this speech in the other bus
[10:57] There are other passengers behind you
too please exit the bus
[11:01] Quickly!
Ma’am please be quick.
[11:08] Ma’am please be quick.
I am being quick.
[11:18] Son, how are your mother 
and father?
[11:21] yes, uncle they’re doing better now
[11:24] May God have mercy.
[11:55] I think maybe you’re in the mood
to get torn to pieces
[11:58] Man,
[11:59] the heart’s not going anywhere,
[12:01] and who would object 
if you were the one breaking it?
[12:09] uncle! Uncle!
[12:11] This man is a thief,
he pickpocketed you
[12:14] He’s a thief
hey you!
[12:18] You son of a …
Get him!
[12:20] She's lying. 
She’s lying! That’s my purse
[12:31] do you know why these people 
are beating that poor man up?
[12:34] Excuse me?
[12:39] You!
you!
[12:41] Man, what are you doing here?
[12:42] Yes, me, so what?
[12:45] You are following me.
What?
[12:47] Man, are you insane? Why on earth 
would I be following you?
[12:51] psycho!
[12:52] you look well-educated but 
your frivolous ways contradict that
[12:55] It seems as though you have 
forgotten your loss that day.
[12:57] hey easy, you winning over me?
[13:00] You won that day 
because you cheated.
[13:03] Oh, really? “The winner cheated” 
that’s what the losers always say
[13:06] (The bus is here, let’s go)
don’t mess with me
[13:09] back off! Over there
[13:11] why should I back off? 
Why don’t you take a step back?
[13:13] you back off.
Don't try to mess with me, idiot.
[13:15] step away.
don’t raise your finger at me
[13:17] Oh, really? 
I’ll do just that
[13:19] take your finger out of my face!
I won’t take my finger down
[13:21] I’ll shove my thumb in your face then
Here you go
[13:23] I’ll miss the bus because of you
[13:25] Hey, stop the bus
 wait!
[13:27] Stop! Stop!
[13:28] calm your horses,
[13:32] the bus is filled with passengers
and there’s only one seat left
[13:36] Now you decide which one of you 
will get it
[13:39] So, put my luggage on the bus, 
and what are you doing staring at me?
[13:41] And why is that? Hey conductor,
[13:43] whatever your bus fare is,
[13:45] I’ll pay you double of that 
because that seat is mine.
[13:47] It works for me.
get in.
[13:49] there’s no issue 
because we are together
[13:53] together? What? 
yes, together.
[13:55] No, she’s not with me; she’s lying!
put this in.
[13:59] Hurry up, it’s getting so late,
we have to get to Lahore
[14:04] Sister, could you scoot 
over a little?
[14:07] (let’s go)
[14:08] I also have to go to 
Lahore on this bus.
[14:11] Actually NO, that woman,
no I don’t want to go on that bus
[14:16] I’d rather walk.
[14:20] Finally, okay, make room.
[14:23] how?
[14:25] Do you see any space here?
[14:26] There’s no space here; move along.
[14:29] You are such a selfish person
[14:31] that even though you can see
 that my leg is hurt,
[14:33] you still won't give me some room.
Have you no shame?
[14:36] Can’t the rest of the passengers 
see that your leg is injured?
[14:40] If they don’t care, why should I?
[14:42] you are such a double-faced person
[14:45] I paid twice as much for this seat;
[14:47] remember you said that we'd adjust,
so now adjust.
[14:50] I already did; this is my bag;
[14:52] here’s me with my phone,
and everything’s chill.
[15:01] Are you just going to stand here 
the whole time?
[15:03] Go stand over there.
[15:06] Move along.
[15:10] You’ll pay for this,
[15:11] Cursed with an injured man’s maledictions
[15:13] it’s very hot in here, 
Thank God
[15:19] What is this? Huh?
[15:22] What is this? Two purses?
[15:30] You ignorant man!
[15:33] You see a girl alone and you think 
you can get free with her?
[15:36] Have you no shame?
Don’t you know how to stand?
[15:38] Are you out of your mind?
[15:39] I have no interest 
in falling over you
[15:41] I wasn’t the idiot 
who pushed the breaks,
[15:43] and if you’re that bothered, 
go sit on the roof.
[15:45] why don’t you go sit on the roof?
[15:47] And oh, driver can’t you drive properly?
[15:49] or are you driving for the first time?
[15:54] Man, the bandits are here!
[15:56] the bus is already at capacity
[15:59] and now we have to make room 
for the bandits too
[16:01] They’re not here for seats; 
they’re here to rob us, you idiot.
[16:03] what?
[16:06] To rob us? Now what?
[16:10] Sit down now!
[16:12] Man, they're here! 
They are here!
[16:14] making noise won’t 
do you any good,
[16:17] don’t try to act smart 
or else I will shoot you
[16:20] Everyone take your stuff 
and get off the bus
[16:26] (inaudible)
[16:29] Don’t you worry brother Anwar; 
I’ll call you the minute she gets here
[16:36] no, I am not worried I was just calling 
to ask if she has arrived yet or not.
[16:42] It’s just that my grandson isn’t home
[16:46] and neither is Hammad
[16:48] otherwise they would’ve picked her up 
from the bus station.
[16:52] She does everything on her own here
[16:57] but I did give her 
your contact number
[16:59] So, if there’s any issue, 
she will call you
[17:01] You did well,
[17:02] so I'll ask her to call you
as soon as she arrives.
[17:06] alright!
[17:13] oh, Dear God I had so many dreams,
[17:17] I wanted to something for my country
[17:20] Oh God, grant me a long life, 
Ameen!
[17:23] Stay quiet!
[17:26] It’s all happening because of you
[17:28] and how you treated me so unjustly
[17:30] everyone, take out all your valuables 
and place them here
[17:33] I don’t have anything of value on me,
I was worrying for no reason
[17:39] You worry about you 
and your expensive watch.
[17:44] Now you’ll know.
[17:45] Stay quiet!
[17:48] It’s just that my leg is injured;
[17:49] otherwise, I would've taken 
these bandits down in a snap.
[17:53] Oh, please,
[17:55] it’s not like you got shot,
you are just trying to be a hero.
[17:59] hey lady it seems like you 
have some unique problems
[18:02] You're making so much noise, 
take it all out
[18:05] We don’t have all day 
we are busy people
[18:07] but brother I don’t have anything
[18:10] I am very poor even my Ticket was 
bought by this great man,
[18:14] he's a rich guy from the city and 
he even has a touchscreen phone
[18:18] Give it to me, quickly!
[18:20] do it.
okay okay, I am handing it over
[18:27] Here you go.
[18:31] Hey, you clever girl, you too,
[18:35] hand it over or you’ll regret it.
[18:53] How will I alert Mian Sahab now?
[18:57] for the love of God be quiet
[19:00] your wails are going to get you killed 
and buried around here somewhere
[19:04] Quiet!
[19:06] Hey you Robber, you’re acting 
so brave with that gun in your hands
[19:11] Give them to me and 
we’ll see who’s braver.
[19:56] Hands up!
[20:04] I am here alone and 
you all are clapping
[20:06] Come here and take the guns!
[20:10] get them!
[20:14] beat them up, 
and him too.
[20:19] police is on their way, 
you will rot in jail now
[20:22] please forgive us.
[20:24] oh, now you want forgiveness?
please forgive us
[20:29] I got sucked into this mess 
because of you
[20:32] One second, take this;
[20:34] don’t let these people go 
till the police arrive.
[20:38] keep them tied up.
[20:41] This is your punishment, 
rot in hell.
[20:44] (inaudible)
[21:16] It’s true what they say,
there is nothing else like Lahore.
[21:27] Hey, if the journey has been good, 
one should leave after saying farewell.
[21:34] I guess whatever floats your boat
[21:47] where are the taximen? 
Taxi?
[21:51] Taxi?
[21:52] brother there is a strike going 
on these taxis are not operating
[21:55] dude
[21:57] What's the situation? Is there a strike
 every day in your city?
[22:01] no, actually, every taxi driver 
in the city went on strike
[22:07] when they learned that a great personality
like you was visiting the city.
[22:11] I think there’s someone 
inside that car
[22:14] Hello brother, good morning; 
wake up
[22:17] Will I go to Model town?
There’s a strike.
[22:19] yes, I am aware 
but I’ll pay you more
[22:22] how much?
you tell me
[22:24] It should be around five hundred.
I’ll take a thousand
[22:26] Okay, thousand it is, 
start the car.
[22:28] Come on, let's go to model town.
[22:30] What are you doing?
[22:31] I am the one who negotiated the fare 
and I am the one who will be going
[22:34] Get out, now!
[22:35] So, what if you negotiated
 the fare first?
[22:37] It seems as though you have never 
used local transport
[22:40] Whoever sits first,
gets the seat.
[22:42] You made the same mistake
 in bus as well
[22:46] Brother, start the car.
[22:48] What the hell, man? I just agreed 
on a fare with you,
[22:51] and I am willing to pay you twice as much,
and you are willing to leave without me?
[22:54] brother my taxi is very spacious,
[22:55] over 6 people can travel 
in it you can sit as well
[22:59] Are you insane?
[23:01] I am not going to travel alone 
with a strange man.
[23:04] strange man?
[23:05] There is no way 
you are leaving without me
[23:11] Let’s see if you can go without me.
[23:14] Leave it! 
Move aside madam.
[23:19] Okay brother! Let’s go.
[23:39] (thinking)
I wonder what kind of a man he is,
[23:45] who knows maybe he’s pretending
to be a passenger
[23:48] but is actually involved in the business
of abducting beautiful girls
[24:04] brother take a right from here
[24:09] no brother, take a left, 
I have to go left
[24:11] left? Why? No, Take a right from here
[24:14] oh hero, if you want turn right so bad
[24:16] then get out and take another one because 
this taxi isn’t going in that direction
[24:20] Take a left brother.
[24:21] Did you eat crows for breakfast today?
[24:23] You just keep fighting with me
[24:25] Do you have zero manners?
[24:27] that’s just how to talk to strangers,
[24:30] if you have an issue then get out!
[24:32] Oh, really? So, you can take up
 the whole taxi?
[24:35] Never.
[24:37] Stay in this lane and stop 
if there’s a medical store nearby.
[24:40] Okay brother.
[24:51] Let's go brother, 
start the taxi now!
[24:54] ma’am but sir hasn’t returned
[24:56] sir?
[24:57] That man even looks shady
[24:59] and we were attacked by robbers 
right after he got in the bus
[25:01] I never trusted him;
[25:02] I think he went to bring his partner 
so he can snatch your taxi from you
[25:07] Leave him here and go! 
Throw away his luggage and drive.
[25:12] Ma'am, are you serious?
[25:13] I swear, throw away his things, 
and let’s go.
[25:22] Go, go, go.
[25:45] Pull over there. 
Yes, here is the location.
[25:48] Thank God, 
I have finally arrived.
[25:58] How much do I owe you?
[26:00] you, ma’am, owe me 
fifteen hundred rupees
[26:02] 1500?
[26:03] Why the shock, ma’am? 
You said you will pay more
[26:07] Hmm, I did say that.
[26:10] Do you even have money?
[26:12] What do you mean I don't?
[26:14] How dare you? 
Do I look broke to you?
[26:18] When I become the prime minister,
[26:20] you’ll be the first one behind bars
[26:23] You’re one to talk.
give me my money so I can go
[26:26] a little patience won’t kill you
[26:31] Here’s your 1500, 
now go!
[26:40] hello!
[26:44] Hello?
[26:45] oh hello,
[26:47] you must be a guest here
[26:49] and you must be the host,
[26:52] Bebo did say that a 
really smart guy lives there.
[26:56] oh really? 
Your bebo said that?
[26:59] yes
[27:00] it sounds like your Bebo can spot 
a diamond in the mud.
[27:03] yes, she can
[27:05] So, shall we go inside the house?
[27:07] whose house?
[27:08] your house, mine is really far away 
and you were obviously waiting for me
[27:13] I had no idea that 
I was waiting for you,
[27:18] I mean, I didn’t know that 
you were coming over
[27:20] Did Ammaji not tell you?
[27:22] No
[27:23] One second, Ammaji?
 Who’s Ammaji?
[27:26] Where does she live?
 who?
[27:28] At your house, where else?
my house? No, she doesn't
[27:32] Did you kick her out?
[27:34] what?
[27:35] one second, who are you? 
What’s your name?
[27:39] My name is Farhad.
[27:40] Frahad?
[27:41] What's this “cheap motorcycle guy” 
doing out here?
[27:43] cheap motorcycle?
[27:45] Ammaji’s guest
[27:46] Yes, Ammaji, and uncle...
[27:49] uncle Hammad, he lives here too
[27:51] Yes, they live here.
[27:53] oh, okay okay so you’re
the neighbours’ guest
[27:56] Shall I go then?
[27:58] Who's even stopping you?
[27:59] Why are you getting mad?
[28:01] If you are a guest of our neighbours,
then we consider you ours as well.
[28:04] I am available to assist you
 at any time.
[28:08] okay you can go now
[28:10] Sister, give the bags to me; 
that’s for me to do.
[28:13] okay take this too.
[28:17] What a nice antique bag.
[28:19] What's for lunch?
I am starving.
[28:21] it’s a surprise
[28:28] I'm not sure where that girl 
got stuck.
[28:32] Hammad had to go out too
[28:35] otherwise he would’ve picked her up 
from the bus stop.
[28:38] Hey, call your husband and
ask when he will get home?
[28:42] okay Ammaji
[28:43] Your guest is here!
[28:45] Greetings, Greetings!
[28:51] Thank God
I was waiting for you all day
[28:54] Yeah, I am here, 
but don't ask how I got here.
[28:58] It’s a long story, 
I’ll explain later
[29:00] okay okay come in.
Greetings!
[29:02] this is Seema, 
your uncle’s wife
[29:05] Mrs. actually.
[29:07] Come sit, you must be exhausted
[29:09] Shenshah go get something 
refreshing for her
[29:15] Greetings!
This is my granddaughter, Saman.
[29:18] And this is Rania,
[29:19] my cousin’s granddaughter,
[29:21] and this is her younger sister, Rabail.
Greetings!
[29:25] Grandma I think we’re going 
to hit off really well
[29:28] Sure.
[29:30] and myself, Shenshah Khan, 
must’ve heard the name
[29:34] (inaudible) No, no, not him.
[29:41] Ammaji, the girl is very innocent
 and sweet,
[29:44] I really like her
[29:46] Just like my Mahir;
[29:48] he has taken the responsibility of this house 
from a very young age.
[29:53] (Thinking) here we go again 
with Mahir’s praises,
[29:57] it’s almost as if she doesn’t even 
see anyone else
[30:00] That picture over there, 
is his.
[30:07] Him?
[30:13] Greetings!
[30:15] Greetings to you too.
My son’s finally back
[30:18] Greetings! 
How are you, Rabail?
[30:20] Greetings Grandma, 
how are you?
[30:23] You really worried me, where have you been
Grandma, don’t ask what happened
[30:26] Who’s that?
[30:28] That's Rania, my cousin’s granddaughter
 that I told you about.
[30:31] yes, I remember
that’s her
[30:34] Oh, look at her getting all shy,
[30:37] my grandson is very innocent 
and sweet.
[30:42] Greetings!
[30:47] you?
[30:52] Her?
[30:53] Yes, that’s her, Rania.
[30:56] Greetings!
[30:58] She’s being polite, 
Answer her,
[30:59] I heard her
[31:01] hey don’t act unreasonable,
[31:03] I have been singing your praises,
don’t show your real face
[31:09] Did she tell you the tales 
of her innocence?
[31:13] she doesn’t have to;
[31:15] it’s written all over her face.
[31:17] written where? 
I don’t see it.
[31:22] Ammaji, I just remembered 
where I have seen him before
[31:27] He was in the same bus as I was, 
he didn't even have seat
[31:30] I took a look at his injury and 
gave him some space on my seat.
[31:38] His days aren’t going so well
[31:41] because you know 
what happened?
[31:42] Bandits broke into our bus 
and attacked it!
[31:45] They beat him up so bad 
I had to jump in to save him
[31:49] If it weren't up to me, he wouldn’t 
be standing here today.
[31:54] what.
[31:55] What is this girl saying?
[31:56] You said you’re getting 
VIP treatment there, serving you
[32:00] But they sent you back on a bus?
[32:03] Who does that? 
I told you not to go,
[32:06] but you never listen to me.
[32:07] grandma listen to me 
without interrupting,
[32:10] you don’t know her at all
[32:12] She’s super cunning.
[32:13] don’t you dare get angry at her
[32:15] Oh, Grandma, she’s lying!
[32:17] Everything she’s saying is a lie
[32:18] why? Didn't the bandits tell you to be
quiet and sit tight or they'd kill you?
[32:22] no such thing happened,
[32:25] in fact because of all her noise 
the bandits’ attention shifted towards me.
[32:29] You don’t know her, she’s a coward
[32:32] Girls are mostly fearful and
 innocent, understand?
[32:38] it’s over now, whatever happened 
is in the past,
[32:42] we have to live in the same house now,
[32:44] we should live with peace and harmony
[32:46] I swear I'll never even mention how much 
the bandits insulted you,
[32:50] and I just remembered
 the full story.
[32:54] He's very brave himself, 
you know he beat them all up...
[33:16] Brother Mahir
[33:18] What's that witch doing here?
[33:19] I came over to stay here
[33:21] No, I'm referring to 
that evil witch Rania;
[33:23] why is she here?
[33:25] What are you talking about? 
She's super cute.
[33:27] She’s Grandma’s cousin’s 
granddaughter,
[33:31] heard she’s pretty smart and 
is here for higher education.
[33:35] Don’t say something stupid 
in front of her, okay?
[33:39] I don't understand
 Grandma’s obsession
[33:41] with making all her relatives 
live in this house.
[33:45] What's the matter?
 Are you guys fighting?
[33:47] Do you know her?
[33:48] Why would I be fighting with her?
[33:50] Even my rivalry has a high level.
[33:54] I don’t know her.
[33:57] anyway, forget it let’s go sit 
with everyone outside
[34:00] I am in no mood at all,
[34:01] I am very tired and my foot hurts
[34:04] I totally forgot to ask, 
how was the wedding?
[34:08] First class!
[34:09] Your brother was hit there
[34:12] People were praising me 
more than the groom.
[34:14] I knew you would have great time
[34:18] Can you get me some tea, please?
I am on it.
[34:23] "Something needs to be done 
about Rania.
[34:29] oh, uncle you came to bring me 
back so early
[34:32] I told you I’d stay a few more days, 
then I’ll come back
[34:35] actually, child the thing is, that house 
feels empty without you
[34:39] And that husband of yours just wanders 
around the house like a lost pigeon
[34:46] I can’t see him like that
[34:49] there was no need for all this fruit
 you’ve brought,
[34:52] do you think we don’t buy 
our own fruit?
[34:56] of course, you do,
[34:58] but the thing is that this fruit 
is the best of quality
[35:02] and everyone deserves 
that once in a while
[35:06] this is Saman’s Brother and 
Father-in-law, come greet them.
[35:10] Greetings! Greetings! So, 
they are Saman’s in-laws
[35:15] But you said they’re pretty well-off
[35:17] yes, we are,
[35:21] I just bought 4 acres of land
[35:23] and we have very big house in the city
[35:26] and we have our own business as well
[35:29] Tell them Khawar or 
do I have to tell them everything?
[35:32] yes, he’s absolutely right.
[35:34] if you are so well-off
[35:37] why didn't it ever occur to you 
to name some land after her?
[35:41] yeah, so that…
[35:43] Dad, Ammaji is absolutely right;
[35:45] we should transfer some property 
to my Sister-In-Law’s name.
[35:47] wow, you have such revolutionary ideas.
[35:50] Daughter-in-law’s share 
in father-in-law’s assets,
[35:52] wow you’ve made me fan.
[35:55] Thank you!
[35:56] who are you child? 
I didnt recognize you
[35:59] She's the granddaughter of my cousin, 
Anwar Ahmed Siddique.
[36:04] God bless you! So, tell more.
[36:09] What type of business 
does your father run?
[36:13] my father has sadly passed away
[36:16] but my grandpa is the headmaster 
of our village Khushhaal Pur’s school,
[36:20] he’s retired now and 
about our assets,
[36:23] that I don’t know; we must have 
some but I never asked
[36:29] she's being modest because her 
"some property" is greater than
[36:31] the sum of your and 
your father's assets.
[36:35] Do you remember when you used
 to live in a house of only 12 yards,
[36:38] or have you forgotten those times?
Is that so father?
[36:41] we should really get going’
[36:44] you are not going anywhere; no guest leaves 
our house without having eaten something
[36:52] and I am also remembering
[36:56] A lot of childhood stories I’d like 
to entertain the kids with while we eat.
[36:59] What was I saying?
[37:00] you were talking about
 his cage-sized house
[37:03] yes!
[37:05] well then Saman, kid I think 
we really should go now,
[37:09] we’ll eat some other time 
Let’s go
[37:15] show off!
[37:18] You don’t know 
what Azra Jahan is capable of,
[37:20] I am not impressed 
by the likes of him
[37:24] He brought fruit!
[37:26] Fruit of the best quality, 
that’s the state of him.
[37:31] you know Ammaji, 
you are my Ideal from now on.
[37:37] be a little careful 
they're my in-laws
[37:39] It’s for you that 
I don’t let his head too high
[37:43] I keep him under my toes
[37:46] because if you get a little too friendly 
with people like him
[37:50] They forget their limits
[37:51] yes!
[37:52] And you won’t find 
these lessons in books
[37:55] What Amma means is that
[37:57] you shouldn’t give too much power 
to those lesser than you
[37:59] Ammaji , I think I will learn 
a lot from you
