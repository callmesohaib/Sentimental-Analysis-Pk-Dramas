[00:16] Bebo?
[00:18] Uncle likes you.
[00:21] I swear, since he heard you are leaving,
he is suffering from fever.
[00:25] He is wandering here and there at home.
[00:29] Bebo?
[00:31] Do you also like uncle? Yes?
[00:34] He is okay.
[00:36] Then why are you going?
[00:37] Because of aunt sweetie?
[00:40] No matter what the reason,
[00:41] I just can’t live here now. I must go.
[00:44] Yes. That is right too.
[00:47] He will come
with your proposal only when you will go. Bebo,
[00:51] swear upon me,
don’t say no for the proposal.
[00:55] Okay, I will see.
[01:00] What is wrong with you?
It turns out to be so good that you came to Lahore.
[01:03] Miyan Jee and mother will be so happy.
[01:04] The search for you is over.
[01:09] The search is indeed over.
[01:11] Right?
[01:12] Then be happy. Are you going crazy?
[01:15] What is wrong with you?
It’s such a moment of happiness.
[01:17] Okay, fine.
[01:19] I am so happy.
[01:20] I will finally wear a braid tassel.
[01:26] Why? Grandmother?
[01:28] Explain it to Bebo.
[01:29] She just came,
and she is already talking about going back.
[01:33] Actually, you people know sister-in-law and
Miyan Jee is alone there.
[01:38] And Miyan Jee is sick as well.
[01:40] So, that is why I will have to go.
[01:44] Child, how can I stop you?
[01:46] There is so much ominous in this house,
[01:50] that even my soul wants to go somewhere.
[01:53] Good morning. Good morning,
everybody.
[01:57] She has come to speak her English.
[02:01] Listen to me.
[02:02] Did no one teach to greet?
[02:04] Yes? Mother,
I am greeting everyone in my own style.
39,
[02:16] There is such a good smell in the whole house.
[02:19] Even in the back store.
[02:20] Wow, it’s such a good atmosphere here.
Hmm.
[02:25] One spends carefully
if he earns with hard work.
[02:28] Here, everything is for free.
[02:29] Cook however you like. Eat however you like.
Spend whatever you like. Hmm?
[02:37] Hey, girl? Make me tea.
[02:41] What is this “hey, girl”?
[02:43] Her name is Rania.
[02:45] Oho. Madam, Rania?
[02:48] Please make me a cup of tea.
[02:51] Yes. You will not take sugar, right?
[02:54] Because someone must
save your halal dollars, right?
[02:57] Listen? Don’t try to be clever.
[03:01] I will take two tablespoon sugar
[03:04] because this is my wealth.
And there is no shame in using your wealth. Got it?
[03:09] Hmm. Yes.
[03:12] Dabeer, darling?
[03:13] Now this house should be
transferred to my name.
[03:20] Now what did you do as such that
I get this house transferred to your name?
[03:25] And that I should transfer all
my property to your name? Yes?
[03:28] Listen to me.
[03:29] This house belongs to my grandson.
[03:31] It belongs to my heir.
[03:33] No need to pour more salt than necessary.
[03:37] Dabeer?
[03:38] Tell your mother that
[03:40] I am talking to my husband.
[03:43] She should not interfere.
[03:46] Don’t talk about your demands on the dining table.
[03:49] I am not demanding anything.
[03:51] I am saying the correct and
the right thing.
[03:54] Sweetie?
[03:56] You are taking undue
advantage of my leniency,
[03:59] and speaking non-stop.
[04:02] Fear that day when I will get angry.
[04:06] Wow, mother. Wow.
[04:07] Now mother is rightly excited.
[04:11] I will definitely get this house
transferred to my name.
[04:17] Rania?
[04:19] You need to go to the university, right?
[04:21] Come on, let me drop you.
[04:22] Listen to me? Put the car keys here before going.
I need to go to shopping today.
[04:26] You need to go to the kitchen,
rather than shopping.
[04:29] Go make two-eggs’ omelette for me.
[04:32] Your tantrums
[04:33] and your mistakes has compelled me
to be a traditional mother-in-law.
[04:37] Dabeer?
Are you listening to your mother?
[04:43] Rania?
[04:44] This spectacle will continue in this house.
[04:46] Let’s go.
[04:47] Bring your bag.
[04:49] Let me drop you at the university.
[04:50] Yes, I will go bring my bag.
[04:52] Sweetie, darling?
[04:54] I don’t want to be a sinner by interfering in your fight
between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.
[05:00] Will you be a sinner
if you will take your mother’s side? Yes?
[05:06] Dabeer,
[05:07] do you the outcome of leaving your
wife among her enemies?
[05:11] No.
[05:12] No?
[05:13] No. You don’t know?
[05:15] No. No?
[05:21] Oh! I died.
[05:27] Oh, God!
[05:28] You are laughing with your teeth open.
Yes?
[05:31] I will make you stop laughing.
[05:32] Mother, are you watching? Yes?
[05:34] I am being harassed mentally and by dress.
[05:36] I am tired. I am tired in my own house.
[05:42] I have never seen such a coward person in
my life ever.
[05:47] Dabeer?
[05:49] Come back to your place.
[05:51] Come back to your place.
[05:52] Yes, yes.
[05:54] I have… I have come back. I have…
[05:56] Coward…
[06:05] Oh, hello? Where?
[06:08] I said I will drop you.
[06:09] Come, sit in the car.
[06:11] Thanks. But no thanks.
[06:13] I am going on uncle Hammad’s bike.
[06:20] See. Look…
[06:21] Both the tyres of your bike are punctured.
[06:22] Now you will not look good
mending the punctures.
[06:25] No problem. I will drop you.
Come on. Let’s go.
[06:27] Is this done by you?
[06:30] Elders say that there is prosperity in movement.
[06:32] Now not everyone is lucky like my uncle.
[06:35] that one gets property without movement.
[06:36] Anyway, don’t worry. I am here.
[06:38] I will drop you. Come on. Come.
[06:40] I don’t want to go with you.
[06:41] Why are you throwing weird tantrums?
[06:43] I am explaining you.
Can’t you understand it?
[06:45] Look, I am already short-tempered.
[06:47] Don’t be rude with me.
[06:49] You cannot force me. Understood?
[06:54] Well, listen, listen, listen, listen. Look?
[06:56] I am sorry. I am sorry.
[06:57] I am requesting you with love.
[06:59] Rania,
I have something really important to talk to you.
[07:02] Please, come with me.
[07:04] Please.
[07:14] I tried to stop aunt a lot.
[07:17] But she left without informing me.
[07:18] Oh, honey, child.
[07:20] I came to search for peace for four days.
[07:22] But I think I don’t have it destined for me.
[07:25] I am stuck in problems after coming here.
[07:28] Try to explain it to her. So,
what else am I doing, honey, child?
[07:32] I am doing the same. I am trying to explain it to her.
But she doesn’t understand anything.
[07:38] Honey, child?
[07:39] I came to meet my family after 20 years.
[07:43] But ever since this woman has come,
[07:45] she has made this house a battlefield.
[07:47] Instead of becoming the daughter-in-law,
she is acting like a wrestler here.
[07:51] Aunt is doing such a wrong thing.
[07:53] Hey, not just an ordinary wrong thing,
honey, child.
[07:56] Hey, she embarrassed me in front
of the whole family.
[08:00] You… You don’t worry.
[08:03] I will talk to her. I will make her understand.
[08:05] What will you explain to her?
She doesn’t understand anything anyone says.
[08:09] Try it yourself. You will waste your efforts.
What should I do? I am stuck, honey, child.
[08:13] I will talk to her, right?
And I will explain it to her in my own way.
[08:17] And you will see.
She will change very soon.
[08:19] Don’t worry.
[08:25] Rania, you…
[08:26] What should I say, man?
[08:29] I would tell her had
she not been father’s wife.
[08:32] I have been taught since childhood that
we should respect elders.
[08:35] I don’t understand
what did she think before saying that?
[08:38] Hey, that is my house.
[08:40] Why should I transfer
my house to her name?
[08:42] What a weird claim is this, man?
[08:44] And you too?
[08:45] You were sitting in front of her silently.
[08:48] You are so ill-manner other ways.
[08:50] You interfere in everyone’s fights.
[08:51] But when it comes to me,
you are completely silent.
[08:54] You couldn’t even speak a word in my favour?
[08:58] Because my elders have taught me
to respect the elders.
[09:03] And I am ill-mannered?
[09:04] Then what are you?
[09:05] What words will you use for yourself?
[09:07] Man, look at this.
I am folding my hands in front of you.
[09:10] I don’t want to fight with you at this time.
[09:13] Man, I am worried.
I am stuck in this situation.
[09:16] Give me any suggestion, any idea.
[09:19] Something as such should happen that this lady
[09:21] should go back to America forever and
never come back.
[09:28] Greetings, doctor Wasiq.
[09:30] How are you?
[09:32] Greetings. I am absolutely fine.
[09:35] You tell me. Where are you lost?
[09:38] Father was also asking about you.
[09:40] Hey, what should I tell you?
University has started. So, I am a bit busy.
[09:44] But I will come pay you a visit.
[09:46] When will you come?
[09:47] I will come soon, don’t worry.
[09:50] Well, talk to you later.
[09:51] Take care, goodbye.
[09:57] I have noticed,
[09:59] whenever doctor Wasiq calls,
[10:02] your face glows a lot.
[10:05] There is so much glow in your house too.
[10:08] Did I put any objection?
[10:09] I mean if my small face glows a little bit,
[10:12] you can’t even digest that.
[10:14] They rightly say.
[10:16] Everyone is jealous nowadays.
[10:18] No one can digest anyone’s happiness.
[10:21] Man, tell me something.
[10:22] When you talk to everyone,
[10:24] with so much love,
you talk while smiling and laughing,
[10:28] but when my turn comes,
[10:30] why do you make such a bad face, man?
[10:32] It is not like that.
[10:34] Actually, the thing is,
while looking at your rotting face,
[10:37] my face has become like this.
[10:38] What to do?
[10:44] When will your class end?
[10:46] I will come to pick.
[10:48] No need to go through this trouble.
[10:50] I will come myself.
[10:52] Go home and take rest.
[10:54] And plan against your stepmother.
Fine?
[10:57] What should I think?
[10:58] She has already made my life hell.
[11:02] That time was amazing, by the way.
When it was your rule.
[11:06] You used to show off in front of the whole family.
[11:09] By wearing new and branded clothes,
you used to show off.
[11:13] You used to weigh every person
with money.
[11:19] By the way,
Mrs. Dabeer came and showed you the mirror.
[11:25] Tell me one thing.
[11:27] Are you at my side or hers?
[11:30] Have you shaken hands with the enemies?
[11:32] Hmm. I am not like rural people.
[11:34] We, desi people, don’t change our loyalty.
[11:40] I will come to pick you
after your class ends.
[11:42] And now stop it, please. Please.
Don’t argue, man.
[11:54] Ever since I entered this house,
I am very sad.
[11:57] All these people are enjoying on my dollars.
[12:00] These people have made such big property.
[12:03] Anyway,
[12:04] I have also decided.
[12:05] Until I transfer all this property to my name,
[12:09] I will not come back.
[12:11] This task is very difficult,
[12:13] but I am also very stubborn.
[12:14] Aunt,
[12:16] you are very innocent.
[12:19] That I am.
[12:20] But here, everyone is very clever.
[12:23] I know they will not let
this task be completed this easily.
[12:26] I do have one way out,
[12:28] through which you
will easily get all the property.
[12:32] You just need to cast your magic.
[12:35] Yes, I know
what way you are trying to tell me.
[12:38] I have also seen the advertisements here
for mystic man and spiritual sister.
[12:42] But I don’t have experience with them here.
[12:45] What if the effect of their magic spell goes wrong way?
And I lose this property.
[12:49] Aunt,
you don’t need to go to the magicians for this.
[12:53] You can cast the spell yourself.
[12:55] Me? How?
[12:58] Aunt,
[12:59] change your style.
[13:01] If you will fight,
[13:02] they all will fight with you altogether.
[13:04] If you listen to me, be sweet.
[13:07] Talk with love to all the elders and youngsters.
[13:10] Hey, honey. This is very difficult.
Think of something else apart from this.
[13:14] Hmm. You must try.
[13:17] Then see how you will get the property.
[13:20] You can control them this way.
[13:23] Haven’t you heard of this?
[13:24] Soft words bring victory.
[13:27] Hmm.
[13:28] You are right at saying this.
[13:31] This is the war I should win.
I have taken the decision.
[13:36] Ever since I came to this house,
[13:38] I feel like having
my name plate in front of this house.
[13:42] Begum Sweetie, daughter Chaudhary.
[13:45] So, that’s it.
[13:46] Apply my formula.
[13:48] Everything will be set.
[13:53] Dabeer’s scoundrel son is here.
[13:55] Aunt, what did I just explain to you?
[13:58] Okay, okay, fine. I understood.
[14:00] Now just see my acting.
[14:02] Bye.
[14:05] I hope this works on her.
[14:15] Here comes my cuddly son.
Welcome home sweet home.
[14:20] What happened to her?
[14:22] Seems like she caught heat in this summer.
[14:24] She has got dementia.
[14:26] Dementia? What is it?
[14:29] Britishers left and left you behind.
[14:30] I mean heat has affected her brain,
and it has stopped working.
[14:35] The brain swells. Don’t you know this?
[14:38] You are right.
[14:40] And seems like the attack is very severe.
[14:42] Look, look, look.
[14:43] How constantly she is smiling?
[14:45] Hmm. Handle her.
[14:48] Let me go grab ice from the fridge.
[14:50] Yes, good idea.
[15:13] Mother? My beautiful mother,
my… My… My mother?
[15:17] I have one request for you.
[15:21] What request do you want to make? Yes?
[15:23] You must be here to put forward
your fatso’s recommendations, right?
[15:25] I am telling you.
I will not accept any of her recommendations. Yes.
[15:29] No, no. It’s not a recommendation, mother.
[15:31] I just wanted to tell you that
sweetie is not bad, mother. She is very kind at heart.
[15:36] She just gets furious a bit.
[15:38] Don’t you dare take her side in front of me.
[15:43] I will kick you both out of this house and
will confiscate your passports.
[15:47] I think you have forgotten my anger.
No, mother. I have not forgotten it.
[15:51] I still have the mark on my back and
can still feel the pain till today.
[15:56] Mother, I am just trying to tell you,
[15:59] that what I used to tell you all the time that
[16:04] the huge superstore I have in the US,
it’s actually Sweetie’s.
[16:09] Sweetie is also mentioning it again and again,
right?
[16:12] It… It is not ours.
[16:15] What nonsense are you uttering?
Yes? Say it openly.
[16:18] Mother, I am telling you openly.
You are not listening to me.
[16:23] Listen to me calmy, mother. Mother,
what I am trying to say is,
[16:28] that sweetie has four brothers.
[16:30] She has three sisters.
[16:32] Those seven people also have
a share in that superstore.
[16:36] Me and Sweetie are not the sole owners.
[16:39] Yes, mother. I am telling you the truth.
[16:41] We both spouses live in a small cage.
[16:43] When sweetie came here
and saw this house,
[16:49] so, mother. She got this mental disorder.
[16:53] So, should I tell you what to do?
[16:54] Take your oldie to America,
[16:57] then get her brain’s treatment done.
[17:01] Even if I die,
[17:03] I will not transfer this house
to Sweetie’s name.
[17:06] Don’t do it. Don’t do it.
When am I asking you to transfer this house to her name, mother?
[17:10] Just listen to me calmy.
My beautiful mother, what I am saying is,
[17:15] put her name plate in front of the house.
[17:19] She will be happy for a while.
You are making my blood pressure high.
[17:24] Sorry, mother. Sorry, mother.
[17:27] Mother? Sorry.
[17:30] So… Don’t know even if there are tablets for
the high blood pressure at home or not?
[17:32] Oh, mother?
[17:44] What is the matter, Bebo?
[17:46] You are very sad ever since you
came back from Lahore.
[17:49] Seeing your loved one after so long and
then leaving them behind,
[17:54] it does make one sad, right?
[17:56] You just went to meet Rania, right?
[17:58] You are even sad after coming back.
[18:01] That is why I didn’t go to meet her.
[18:04] Once I would have hugged her,
[18:06] then I wouldn’t leave her.
[18:08] My heart doesn’t agree.
[18:12] Hey, Bebo?
[18:13] Shall I tell you one thing?
We have got such a nice proposal for you.
[18:16] Boy is from America.
[18:18] He got married there to a white then
couldn’t settle down.
[18:21] So, that’s it.
[18:22] He wants to marry in Pakistan…
Pakistan, what?
[18:24] He wants to have another experience in Pakistan?
[18:28] That it will be okay if it works.
Goodbye otherwise.
[18:31] Sister-in-law, listen to me.
[18:33] I am not fond of marrying for an experience.
[18:36] No matter how I am,
I am very happy in my life.
[18:41] What happened to her?
[18:44] She was not this rude.
[18:47] Let me call Rania and ask her.
[18:49] What problems occur there?
[19:06] Greetings, mother.
[19:08] Dabeer, am I dreaming?
[19:11] Don’t know, mother. How can I know?
[19:13] Take a pinch out of mother.
[19:16] Yes.
[19:17] Look. No, no, it’s a reality. It’s a reality.
[19:22] I am the one who woke up from the sleep,
mother.
[19:24] I am very sorry.
[19:26] I know I was so over.
[19:28] But I apologize to you.
[19:31] Now I will show you being a good daughter-in-law.
It will not happen next time.
[19:34] I am ashamed of my rudeness.
[19:37] Rania, put my recommendation.
[19:40] Recommendation?
[19:41] I can’t understand anything myself.
[19:44] Mother,
[19:45] in my village,
[19:47] such people are taken to the spiritual man.
[19:51] He brings the jinn out of people.
[19:53] And his way is a bit different.
[19:55] He beats the people with the broom with twigs.
[19:58] But even if the jinn is foreigner,
[20:00] it surely runs away.
[20:02] No, no. Sweetie can’t catch a jinn.
[20:06] They fear Sweetie themselves.
They die out of fear.
[20:11] Sweetie, you are joking, right?
[20:15] I know you are joking.
[20:17] By the way, your jokes are so weird.
Right?
[20:21] No joke. No lies.
[20:23] I am very serious.
[20:24] But why are you serious?
[20:26] Your tone has changed suddenly.
[20:28] I just made a mistake.
[20:29] Dabeer, tell mother?
[20:31] That Sweetie has such sweet nature.
[20:34] Really?
[20:35] This is breaking news.
[20:38] This is breaking news.
[20:39] Well, let’s do one thing.
Note me for some days.
[20:43] Look for 10 to 15 days.
[20:45] Then you will scream and
will tell the whole world yourself,
[20:48] that my sweetie is the best
daughter-in-law in the whole world.
[20:51] And then you
will make me your heir yourself.
[20:55] Dabeer,
what do you say jaannasheen in English?
[20:58] Oh, I don’t know.
[20:59] I cannot understand anything.
[21:01] My brain has gone numb.
[21:03] Neither I understand Urdu, nor English.
[21:06] I am just amazed.
[21:08] Mother, pinch me, am I dreaming?
[21:12] Have you become the cannibal? Yes?
[21:18] You took a bit out of my beloved son?
Yes?
[21:24] Mother, no matter how I am,
I am your sweet daughter-in-law, Sweetie.
[21:36] Have you seen a clock going anti-clockwise?
[21:40] No.
[21:41] They go forward, not backwards.
[21:45] Life also goes forward towards its end.
[21:59] Don’t worry.
[22:02] Miyan Jee will be fine.
[22:05] God will do good.
[22:07] Miyan Jee never talked about
such things ever before, Bebo.
[22:11] My heart is pounding.
[22:14] My courage and strengths are diminishing.
[22:17] Sister-in-law,
[22:18] you have always been this timid.
[22:20] Atleast learn something from your daughter.
[22:23] Nothing will happen to Miyan Jee.
[22:25] My heart says so.
[22:27] And we will make
Miyan Jee pay a visit to a big renowned doctor.
[22:32] Everything will be fine.
[22:33] No doctor has the treatment for Miyan Jee,
Bebo.
[22:37] Miyan Jee’s son has his treatment.
[22:43] Sadness of being away from
his son is eating him within.
[22:47] He is his strength.
[22:51] But Miyan Jee,
[22:54] is unable to forgive him because of us.
[23:02] Everything will be fine.
[23:12] You didn’t go today? Is it your day off?
[23:14] No. I just have one class.
It will start at 12.
[23:17] What will I do after going so early?
I will go comfortably.
[23:19] Fine.
[23:19] I will do one thing. Let me ask brother Maheer.
He will drop you.
[23:22] Leave your brother Maheer.
[23:24] I don’t want him to take the car from
his stepmother giving her my excuse.
[23:27] Besides, I have already taken the
bike keys from uncle Hammad.
[23:31] By the way, poor brother Maheer
is facing so much oppression.
[23:35] Not that much oppression.
[23:37] You don’t know
yet what stepmothers do to the children.
[23:41] Aunt Sweetie is still lenient.
[23:43] Ask him to endure.
[23:46] Are you being too rude to my brother?
[23:50] No.
[23:51] Your brother is not that much important to me.
[23:53] That I will be rude to him
or offended with him.
[23:57] Anyway, leave.
[23:59] You tell me.
[24:00] Did you meet my brother?
Did he come to jog today?
[24:05] Yes. He comes every day to jog.
[24:09] But Rania, honestly speaking,
I can’t wake up early in the morning.
[24:13] Man, I can’t wake up. What to do?
[24:15] By the way, I repent.
Girls nowadays are so ungrateful.
[24:20] You are getting such a loving life-partner and
you are not done with your tantrums.
[24:23] No, it’s not about being ungrateful.
[24:27] I am just a bit lazy.
[24:29] Now what to do?
[24:30] I will get a little influenced by
uncle Hammad, right?
[24:38] If Miya Jee gets a good treatment in the city,
[24:41] then he will be fine.
[24:46] Sister-in-law was right.
[24:49] To kick brother out of his life,
[24:53] the way Miyan Jee was gone stone hearted,
[24:55] it’s so heavy today,
[24:58] that it is not letting Miyan Jee breathe.
[25:05] I will have to call brother.
[25:09] I was keen to move forward.
[25:18] If my father got me higher education,
[25:22] then it was just
[25:24] because I could become a good human being.
[25:28] But I was crazy to become rich.
[25:37] My first job,
[25:40] was just giving me a few thousand
which was too low for me.
[25:48] My heart was so sad.
[25:51] But my moderation-lover father was so happy.
[25:55] Whereas I thought that
[25:57] if I would get a chance to have a shortcut,
[26:00] I will definitely not lose that chance.
[26:05] After my wedding,
I left my wife with my father and sister,
[26:08] I came back to the city,
[26:11] when accidentally and coincidentally,
[26:16] my boss’ daughter came into my life.
[26:20] Now she was a divorcee woman.
[26:24] She was older than me.
[26:26] But I knew.
[26:29] that if she comes into my life,
[26:32] then I will get everything I would wish for.
[26:38] I forgot my wife during those days.
[26:41] I forgot her completely.
[26:44] Hmm.
[26:47] You didn’t… You didn’t think
of your daughter while doing all of this?
[26:55] I didn’t even see her face.
[26:59] Then I left all of them
[27:04] and married Yusra and
moved to another country.
[27:11] And now…
[27:13] After so many years…
[27:16] I am feeling that loss.
[27:19] I am knocking those closed doors,
[27:23] that are closed on me forever.
[27:27] Do you know?
[27:30] Girls without their fathers,
[27:34] how do those girls survive
without their fatherly love and shelter?
[27:40] No matter how complete they are,
[27:44] they do get something missing in them.
[27:48] I did make a mistake.
[27:50] I made a huge mistake. And…
[27:53] And I want to fix that mistake.
[27:58] I want to hug my daughter.
[28:01] I want to take the burden off of
my weak father.
[28:08] But…
[28:11] But…
Those people are used to living without me.
[28:19] No matter if I am there or not,
[28:25] it doesn’t matter at all.
[28:30] This… This can’t be true.
[28:34] This can’t be true at all.
Your place must be empty till today.
[28:41] Your family must be waiting for you.
[29:00] You must be a bit late in going back but…
[29:06] But… But this is possible. You…
[29:08] Don’t lose hope, uncle.
[29:12] Keep on knocking the closed doors.
[29:16] One day, the doors will be opened.
[29:23] Your daughter is so lucky.
[29:26] That her father is alive.
[29:29] And now he is about to meet her.
[29:32] With God will.
[29:35] My…
[29:37] My father cannot meet me.
[29:41] But your family will not be offended
with you for so long.
[29:45] If they will be, let me know,
I will go with you.
[29:48] I will talk to them and will make them
understand that they should forgive you.
[29:53] And they will forgive you.
[29:56] Thanks a lot, daughter.
[29:59] Thank you so much.
[30:01] You gave me courage.
[30:05] You showed me a ray of hope.
[30:08] Otherwise, I was really disappointed.
[30:13] When someone loses hopes,
[30:17] my job starts from there. Yes?
[30:21] Well, uncle. I will go now.
[30:23] I am getting late. Yes.
[30:28] Come, please.
[30:34] Where are you going?
[30:35] You just came. Please sit.
[30:38] No, I am already late.
[30:39] Mother must be waiting.
[30:41] I told her that I am going for a while.
[30:43] Okay.
[30:45] Let me drop you.
How will you go alone? Come on.
[30:48] I didn’t come alone.
[30:50] I came with sister Anjum.
[30:51] Don’t know where did
she go in the kitchen?
[30:53] She was saying that
she was cooking chanmbeli koftay.
[30:55] She should have been done by now.
[30:57] Not chanmbeli, nargisi koftay.
[31:00] Oh, okay, okay.
The same, the same.
[31:03] What are you looking at, doctor?
[31:05] Please call her. I am getting late.
[31:08] Oh, yes. Let me go call her.
[31:10] Faster, please.
[31:13] Come.
[31:18] Bebo?
[31:20] What is the matter?
Whom are you calling?
[31:22] All good?
[31:24] Just like that…
[31:27] All good, you sure? Hmm.
[31:44] Mother?
[31:45] What do you want me to cook today?
Tell me?
[31:47] I know you consider me dumb.
But I am not that dumb.
[31:52] Whatever you will ask me,
[31:53] as per your instructions, all the lentils,
vegetables, I will cook them all.
[31:59] You just tell me. What do you want to eat?
[32:00] Oh. Then you have come at the right time.
[32:04] Because the one who cooks food
has taken her day off today.
[32:07] Then you do one thing,
[32:09] don’t look after, cook food yourself today.
[32:12] Make karahi chicken.
[32:14] Yes? Yes. Karahi chicken would work.
[32:18] Chicken karahi?
[32:19] What the hell?
[32:20] Honey,
what problem did you make me stuck to?
[32:26] Hey, mother?
[32:28] Why are you sitting alone?
[32:30] Yes? And Rania has not come yet too.
[32:32] Where are our family members?
[32:34] What is wrong with you?
[32:35] Why are you getting worried?
[32:40] Mother?
[32:41] You are saying so as
if don’t know what I asked you.
[32:45] Besides, it was nothing to be offended at.
[32:47] It is to be offended at.
[32:48] My daughter-in-law has come and is cooking.
And you don’t care at all.
[32:51] I do care a lot.
[32:52] But I am compelled.
[32:54] Children have got so much homework.
[32:56] And their tests are starting.
I am teaching them.
[32:58] Come on,
you both go and cook food together.
[33:01] Yes. For sure, mother.
[33:04] You go to the kitchen.
[33:06] I will join you after doing two to
three petty tasks.
[33:10] Yes? Okay.
[33:12] Tipu?
[33:14] Mano?
[33:22] This boy is wonderful too like this house.
[33:25] He just has one bad thing.
[33:27] He is my stepson.
[33:30] But the property is in his possession.
[33:34] If I somehow control
this boy along with this house,
[33:39] then my honey’s future will be secured too.
[33:43] Hmm…
[33:45] This will turn out to be second
Dabeer for our family.
[33:59] Stop, stop the bike.
[34:00] What ill-manners are these?
Why have you come at front?
[34:02] If you are so fond of dying then
go stand in front of some trucks.
[34:05] And those trucks with their breaks failed.
Shut up, Rania.
[34:09] Do you know what time is it?
[34:10] Your university was closed long ago.
[34:12] Where have you been?
[34:13] How are you talking to me?
[34:15] I won’t come under anyone’s pressure.
Understood?
[34:18] I know.
[34:19] Answer my question.
[34:20] Where were you?
[34:24] At Dr. Wasiq’s place.
[34:25] Okay? Now take a side. Why?
[34:27] Why did you go to that doctor’s place?
[34:29] What storm occurred as such?
[34:30] Why should I tell you?
[34:31] Why did I go? What is your problem?
[34:33] You live in our house.
[34:35] You are our responsibility.
[34:37] We are answerable to your mother
and Miyan Jee.
[34:40] Otherwise, I am not fond of guarding you.
[34:42] Fine.
[34:43] I was late for real today.
[34:45] I will not be late next time.
[34:46] One second.
[34:47] You will go to that
Dr. Wasiq’s house again?
[34:50] What is your problem?
[34:52] Me coming late or me going to
Dr. Wasiq’s place?
[34:55] Why don’t you mind your own business?
Yes?
[34:58] Anyway, whatever it is.
[34:59] I don’t want to argue at this time.
I am tired. Okay?
[35:02] I am going. I am worried for you for so long.
[35:04] I am walking here and there.
[35:05] Don’t you care at all?
[35:07] Did I ask you to be worried or to wait?
[35:11] I was talking about mother.
[35:15] Okay. Then let me go talk to mother.
[35:17] And for your information,
I informed mother before going.
[35:26] Listen?
[35:32] I was the one worried for you.
[35:34] I was the one walking here and there.
[35:36] And you will justify in front of grandmother?
[35:39] What problem do you have with me, Rania?
[35:41] Why do you go alone everywhere?
[35:43] You could have told me.
[35:45] I would have taken you
to that scoundrel myself.
[35:50] What are you saying?
[35:51] You called that innocent man a scoundrel?
[35:57] You point of flaws in everyone, right?
[36:01] You find flaws in everyone but yourself.
[36:05] Change yourself.
[36:07] Fix yourself.
[36:08] This American mother who is being sent here,
[36:10] she has been imposed on you like hell.
[36:13] She will fix you.
[36:15] Why are you being hyper
if I said something about Wasiq?
[36:19] Not just Wasiq. Dr. Wasiq.
[36:22] Address him with respect.
[36:24] And yes.
[36:25] I am going hyper.
[36:27] So, be careful next time.
[36:30] And stop considering me your responsibility.
[36:32] Thanks to God,
my guardians are alive.
[36:36] I would have been shifted to a hostel long ago
[36:39] if mother didn’t swear on her love for me.
