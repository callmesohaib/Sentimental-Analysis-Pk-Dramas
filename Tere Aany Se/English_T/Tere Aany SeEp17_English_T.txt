[00:18] Oh no, and to be honest,
[00:21] I've learned to smile from you.
[00:24] From me?
[00:27] How?
[00:28] Now I can casually talk to people,
[00:30] make casual conversations,
smile and laugh.
[00:33] You'll learn everything in near future.
[00:36] Oh and they'll be getting married soon,
[00:38] you have to come okay?
[00:40] Oh I didn't introduce.
[00:41] This is Rabail, my cousin.
[00:43] And you've met Farhad,
[00:44] and you know Laiba very well
she was your patient.
[00:48] Laiba? How are you now?
[00:50] I'm perfectly fine.
[00:52] But I miss your scolding.
[01:06] Okay so I'll meet you guys later,
take care.
[01:09] Yes, bye.
[01:27] This person is the father of Dr. Wasiq?
[01:38] He's a doppelganger of my father.
[01:42] Hello?
[01:44] Where, where are you lost?
[01:45] Nowhere, nowhere.
[01:47] Can we go home now?
[01:49] We'll have the ice cream
on the way back home.
[01:51] Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
[01:57] Mother, I don’t know where did I lose
the passport I cannot find it,
[02:01] but I'm trying my beloved mother.
[02:04] As soon as I find my passport,
[02:06] I'll book the tickets
and land on your feet.
[02:10] No, no, no, no, no bands or music.
[02:13] There is no need for drums or bands.
[02:15] Dabeer.
[02:18] Here we go.
[02:23] Yes Madam Sweetie,
[02:25] today you've returned so soon?
[02:28] Who were you talking to? Tell me.
[02:30] What do you mean by who?
[02:32] I only have a mother,
I was talking to my mother.
[02:36] My mother, my mother.
[02:37] Dabeer, everyone has only one mother,
[02:40] but yours is equal to 100.
[02:44] This woman couldn't learn English
for 30 years.
[02:47] What are you trying to speak without
the volume? Speak up.
[02:50] Get me my passport.
[02:53] Oh so you finally said it out loud,
[02:57] the cat is out of the bag,
you want the passport?
[03:00] That's your mother, the one you have been
secretly talking to,
[03:03] the one who has been asking you
to return for 20 years?
[03:06] You want passport?
Do not make me angry.
[03:10] If I get angry, I'll kick you out of the house
in this cold, you'll freeze.
[03:15] No, Madam Sweetie,
I'm already shivering.
[03:18] You know already how cold I get.
No, no, no, no, you're joking, right?
[03:24] I'm not joking, I'll make it happen,
I'm going to open the door.
[03:29] That's also a joke, right?
[03:31] No, no, I'll make it true today,
get away.
[03:56] Come on doctor, come on.
[03:58] Have a seat.
Greetings.
[04:01] Doctor, it looks like the patient
was waiting for you.
[04:07] Hello Mahir, how are you?
[04:10] Where did he come from?
[04:12] Yes, I'm fine.
[04:14] Let me get some tea for you.
[04:16] Oh no, there is no need for that,
let it be, have a seat.
[04:19] No, no, there is a need, that's why.
I'll just be back.
[04:26] Injury is, this leg or?
Oh this leg.
[04:30] Oh it's here man.
[04:32] Okay sorry.
[04:34] It's on this one?
[04:38] Sorry.
[04:42] Well, I haven't seen your cousin around?
[04:48] Doctor, I am your patient,
not my cousin.
[04:53] Forget about her and examine me.
[04:56] It seems like, the injury has negatively
impacted his temperament.
[05:00] It will be fine, okay?
Don't worry,
[05:02] everything will be fine.
[05:03] Don't worry doctor,
[05:05] nothing happened to his temperament
it has been like this forever.
[05:09] Exactly like a bitter gourd.
[05:12] Rania told me.
[05:14] What, what, what, what?
[05:17] Rania has been telling all this?
[05:18] Oh no, she used different words
[05:22] but they implied the same meanings.
[05:24] She didn't tell you anything
about herself?
[05:26] If I'm like a bitter gourd,
she's not like honey either.
[05:30] Oh, oh, oh, you both recently fought?
[05:34] Well, the fights between
the lovers are so much fun.
[05:38] I wish to get into such fights.
[05:41] Well, let Rania know that I'm here,
[05:44] so I could meet her as well.
[05:46] She has an amazing personality.
[05:49] Your amazing personality is not at home doctor,
[05:51] she has gone too far and she'll return very late.
[05:54] If you want to meet someone else, some uncles,
do you want me to call them for you?
[05:56] No, no, please calm down, calm down,
why are you getting angry?
[06:00] Nurse I think his blood pressure
is getting high.
[06:02] I think we should check his
blood pressure first of all.
[06:04] We'll also check your temperature.
[06:06] Doctor, how is he?
[06:09] Mother, apart from his mood,
everything is fine.
[06:12] Okay, now I want to tell you
that next Friday,
[06:15] my granddaughter is getting engaged,
you both are invited.
[06:21] Grandmother that is our private event,
[06:26] only family members are invited
[06:29] so we'll invite them sometime else.
[06:32] He is also our family doctor,
he has to come.
[06:35] Who else leave their patients at the hospital
to check someone at home?
[06:40] You are right, we will definitely come now
that you're insisting.
[06:45] Right?
[06:46] Okay now come on the tea is served.
[06:47] Come on, have some tea.
[06:49] Come on.
[06:53] Bag?
[07:04] Come on, start preparations.
[07:08] A wedding will take place.
[07:10] Who's getting married, uncle?
[07:12] Sister's granddaughter Rabail?
[07:15] Rabail is getting married.
[07:16] She was telling that our Rania is in the front line,
making all the arrangements.
[07:21] She was telling me that we're only going
for a simple engagement now.
[07:25] Later we'll have a grand wedding.
[07:27] All of you will be invited,
then we will go.
[07:30] No, no, uncle.
I really want to meet Rania.
[07:33] You can join later at the wedding,
I'll go now.
[07:36] Bebo? Why do you lose
your mind like this?
[07:38] We'll go to the wedding together.
[07:40] No I cannot wait any more,
I want to go now.
[07:44] Let her go uncle,
she really wants to go
[07:47] and Rania will also be delighted
to see her.
[07:49] Okay then go.
Really?
[07:52] Thank you, uncle,
I love you so much.
[07:55] Here we go, haven't even reached
Lahore yet,
[07:57] and already you're speaking English.
[08:01] Call and inform Rania.
[08:03] No, no.
[08:04] Nobody is going to tell Rania,
I'll surprise her.
[08:08] Okay, that's also good.
[08:16] What happened?
[08:17] What's the purpose of this corner meeting,
what's the meaning, what's the agenda?
[08:19] Why did you call me here?
I am going.
[08:21] Hey, let me tell you.
The agenda is,
[08:23] that we want to include you in our team.
[08:27] Because the more votes we get,
the more the chances for succeeding, right?
[08:32] Thank God, for the first time
she said something smart, good.
[08:36] Uncle, it's simple,
[08:38] we don't want that lizard-like khawar
to be a son and law of this house.
[08:41] Son, It won't matter
what you want or don't.
[08:44] All of this is decided.
[08:46] We've compelled him to say no
to this wedding, by pressuring him.
[08:54] When you've already done all this,
then what do you want from me?
[08:58] I don't know,
she brought you here.
[09:01] I told her,
[09:03] what if you go and tell this to our aunt?
[09:05] And she went to tell the grandmother.
[09:07] Our secret will be out before time.
[09:11] Why would he tell anyone?
Our uncle is not a tattletale.
[09:15] Or someone crazy, or wife's servant,
who'd tell anyone.
[09:19] Right uncle?
[09:21] This child is absolutely right,
I'm not a tattletale,
[09:24] wife's servant, or crazy who'd tell
everyone or tell his wife.
[09:28] She's right.
Oh wow.
[09:30] Okay now listen to me.
Wait a minute,
[09:33] there's tell something left to say?
[09:35] A whole movie is remaining my friend.
[09:38] Okay so the situation is Khawar
agreed to say no,
[09:43] but he's scared of our grandmother
and his father.
[09:47] So now all we have to do is,
[09:49] not invest anything and
get the best results.
[09:52] Meaning?
[09:54] Don't ask me the meaning,
I've hardly learned the line.
[09:57] It means, to get our way without
anyone finding out.
[10:01] Yes.
[10:03] This girl is clever as a fox.
Right uncle?
[10:06] Never got arrogant about it.
[10:07] And what's this clever?
You could have called me intelligent.
[10:10] But those are the words
people with low IQ use.
[10:13] Okay well.
[10:14] Grandmother is free at the moment,
[10:16] I think it's the best time to talk to her.
[10:18] Let's go.
Let's go.
[10:20] Let's go.
Let's go.
[10:21] Come on uncle.
Come on.
[10:25] I have asked you a thousand times
why are you going back Mona?
[10:28] Because it really doesn't matter if I stay here,
that's why I am going back.
[10:33] You are not going anywhere.
[10:34] Till the day mother announces
your engagement
[10:37] with Mahir on top of her lungs.
You can't go anywhere.
[10:41] I can't live in this delusion anymore.
[10:44] I'm not wasting any more time
in these false hopes.
[10:47] Because Mahir clearly said no to me.
[10:50] And that Parvez got engaged
to someone in the village.
[10:53] And the other one?
[10:54] He's also involved with another girl.
[10:56] If I don't go back in time,
I will lose all the other boys too.
[10:59] That's why I am not going to waste
my time in this delusion.
[11:03] That's why please spare me, I'm going,
your Mahir has a lot of attitudes.
[11:07] Forget everyone else,
but tell me.
[11:10] Mahir said no to you and only now
you're telling this to me?
[11:14] It is not a good news that
I should have given you earlier.
[11:19] Whatever,
[11:20] I've told Parvez that
I'm coming back.
[11:23] First we'll get engaged then
he will marry me.
[11:26] And till then, he should stay away
from all the other girls.
[11:29] What's with you,
[11:30] you will get married to the Romeo
of that neighborhood,
[11:33] but my whole plan failed.
[11:35] Why do you want all my boys to run away
just for the sake of your plan?
[11:40] Hey?
[11:42] This packing?
[11:43] Are you going somewhere?
[11:44] Yes, my innocent sister is going back
after being disappointed.
[11:50] Why?
[11:51] There is nothing like that,
I am just going back.
[11:55] Then don't go back yet,
[11:57] attend my engagement first,
then you can go.
[12:00] Yes, Mona, you're not going
anywhere till the event.
[12:04] What if something impossible happens?
[12:06] Aren't you my sister?
Please, Mona.
[12:09] Just say yes, say yes, yes.
[12:11] Your elder sister is asking you,
please say yes.
[12:16] Yes.
[12:19] Khawar was roaming wandering
in a park holding s girl's hand?
[12:27] I can't believe this.
[12:29] Uncle couldn't believe this
either but then.
[12:32] Uncle, tell her how are you believed,
think about it.
[12:37] How did I believe? I don't know.
[12:41] I can't remember it.
[12:43] He forgot about it, he has a disease
of forgetting things.
[12:46] You told me by yourself
[12:49] that when you went near them,
Khawar ran away, scared.
[12:53] I remember it now, you did well
by reminding me on time.
[12:57] I have this disease from childhood
[13:00] that I forget everything that I memorize,
right mother?
[13:02] Yes, grandmother,
even I saw him.
[13:08] At a restaurant, with a girl, yes.
[13:11] When?
You were bedridden for days.
[13:17] His friend texted, grandmother.
[13:23] Mahir received a message
from his friend,
[13:26] he sent a picture of a boy and a girl.
[13:28] And there was also a message.
[13:29] And when Mahir saw that picture?
[13:31] Yes, grandmother, grandmother,
when I saw the picture,
[13:34] I lost my senses.
[13:35] It was him, in the picture,
it was that Khawar.
[13:39] Brother-in-law, I mean,
brother-in-law to be.
[13:43] Mahir's condition after seeing
that picture, grandmother.
[13:48] Mahir started crying when
he thought about his sister's sorrow.
[13:51] Mahir, show grandmother,
how you cried.
[13:59] God, my child's fate.
[14:02] Well, it isn't so late grandmother.
[14:05] I'd suggest, calling them right now
[14:08] and cancelling the engagement.
[14:09] That's the problem,
[14:12] respected people do not go
against their word.
[14:16] We have to keep our word.
[14:18] Now look, one of our girls is married
to that family,
[14:22] if we say no to this,
her life will be a tornado.
[14:25] And if we tell Rafique,
then Khawar will deny it.
[14:29] And then Saman's father-in-law will think
I'm taking out the old quarrel.
[14:33] Oh God, what will happen to my child?
[14:38] I see.
[14:40] Mother, don't worry,
don't take the stress.
[14:44] Everything will be alright,
[14:45] Rania will manage everything,
right Rania?
[14:50] Yes.
[14:52] Grandmother, me, a delicate soul,
how many things will I manage on my own?
[14:56] I think we should all try our best.
[15:03] How happy I was,
[15:05] such a great son-in-law
I'll be getting.
[15:08] Who won't even look us in the eye,
[15:11] you'll respect us.
[15:14] How cunning he actually is.
[15:17] Yes.
Yes.
[15:19] Yes.
[15:21] That's exactly what I was telling you earlier,
grandmother.
[15:22] That he does not deserve my sister.
[15:27] Where are you going?
[15:28] To tell that cunning unfortunate
to just say no confidently,
[15:33] I solved the problem on grandmother's side.
[15:49] Mister, can you please solve
the problem of our land?
[15:54] It'll be solved,
I talked to a registrar about it,
[15:57] but you know such matters take time.
[16:03] Greetings.
Greetings.
[16:07] Asma, where are you returning from?
With so many things?
[16:12] Aunt, I'm preparing to go to Lahore.
[16:15] Here we go, I told a boy's family
that you're here.
[16:19] And you're preparing to leave.
[16:21] Hey bebo, remember that doctor?
[16:24] Who sent the marriage proposal?
[16:25] Which one?
[16:27] The one who mistakenly gave his wife
the wrong injection.
[16:33] That veterinary doctor?
He's alive again?
[16:38] A doctor is a doctor, whether it’s
for humans or for animals.
[16:42] He didn't give her the wrong injection,
it was the nurse.
[16:45] She gave his wife the wrong injection
out of jealousy.
[16:47] Whatever,
[16:48] he has already sent a proposal once
and I've rejected it.
[16:53] And only an animal's doctor left
for me now?
[16:55] Bebo, listen to me,
[16:57] is it necessary to pick cons
in all the proposals?
[16:59] You said the same thing earlier
and rejected.
[17:01] Getting married is also important,
[17:04] you'll end up alone like this.
Then let it be.
[17:07] Because I'm not staying here anyway.
[17:08] And also I'm not interested
in that doctor in the stables.
[17:12] But we're interested,
[17:14] and we've called them,
and we'll talk to them.
[17:17] Mister, it's a good thing,
[17:20] you'll save a lot on milk expenses
after her relationship,
[17:23] and he also has a business of eggs.
[17:32] Nothing, have the tea.
[17:38] Brother?
[17:40] You're getting ready like
it's your engagement.
[17:43] Yes it's mine.
What?
[17:44] No, no, I mean doesn't matter who is getting
engaged, it's an engagement.
[17:49] And also we should learn to be happy
in other's happiness.
[17:53] I really don't want to go,
[17:55] Farhad I made up my mind
after listening to you.
[17:58] To make Rabail my daughter-in-law.
[18:01] Hey.
[18:02] You're getting late, come on fast.
[18:05] Nice.
[18:06] Mother, why are you not wearing a ring?
[18:08] Where is the ring?
[18:10] Hey, leave it, let it be.
[18:12] How can I leave it?
Laiba?
[18:13] So and get that round cut ring from inside.
[18:17] Go, get it.
[18:19] Didn't wear a ring.
[18:21] Hey, we'll get late.
[18:22] What if we reach there exactly
at the dinner time?
[18:24] All eyes on us?
[18:26] Then the food isn't swallowed,
it gets stuck here.
[18:30] See, I understand your emotions,
[18:33] don't get too sentimental.
Yes Laiba, here.
[18:36] I don't understand why the videographers
at the wedding are only interested in one shot?
[18:40] I mean if someone is taking out
more food,
[18:42] is it necessary to make his video?
Okay now, come on.
[18:45] Come on.
Hurry up.
[19:24] Greetings aunt,
how are you?
[19:27] Greetings.
[19:28] Greetings, how are you?
Come on in.
[19:34] Look how our Mano is looking.
Cute.
[19:37] She's looking cute right?
[19:38] Mano, look at sister Laiba's bangles,
they are beautiful right?
[20:01] The boy's family has arrived.
[20:03] The boy's family has arrived?
[20:10] Greetings uncle.
[20:12] Greetings my child, live long.
[20:15] Welcome, welcome.
Greetings
[20:16] Greetings, how are you, all good?
Greetings, live long, live long.
[20:20] Greetings, welcome.
How are you?
[20:23] Greetings.
[20:25] Greetings sister.
[20:28] Greetings.
[20:32] What?
[20:34] Recently learned to walk?
[20:36] Intend to step somewhere and
ending up somewhere else?
[20:38] How can you understand
my condition?
[20:40] I feel like I'm going towards a warzone.
[20:42] I'm really nervous.
[20:44] Don't worry,
I've managed that as well.
[20:48] I cannot believe you.
[20:49] Believe her my child,
believe her.
[20:52] You don't look so well?
Yes, that.
[20:54] Khawar, Khawar, come forward.
[20:58] Brother Khawar, come forward.
You're a special guest today,
[21:00] you'll have to sit there.
[21:02] And also it's such a happy day we'll
have double relations with this family.
[21:05] Come, come, come, come.
[21:09] Come on, sit here.
Take a seat.
[21:20] He isn't going to deceive, right?
[21:22] Listen to me,
if you cheat us, then.
[21:28] You came here on your own feet
[21:31] but you will return on 4 shoulders.
[21:33] Understand?
[21:35] Smile, smile.
[21:37] Hey nephew,
[21:38] I can see a lot of potential
on table number 8,
[21:42] who are these people?
[21:48] Keep in mind, you'll only say no.
[21:55] Or it won't end well for you.
[21:57] Rabail sent a message.
What?
[22:00] That if you say yes,
[22:02] then you’ll be the one responsible
for her death.
[22:06] And she’ll write your name
on her suicide note.
[22:10] People will look down on the whole family.
[22:14] The hard-earned respect will turn to dust.
[22:19] And if something happens to my sister
[22:22] then you know what will happen
to you, right?
[22:27] Smile.
Let’s take a picture.
[22:31] I’m sure they’re the freeloaders.
Confirm freeloaders I’m telling you.
[22:34] Have you seen him, anywhere else
when the weddings?
[22:39] Here, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:42] I didn’t introduce myself.
[22:46] My name is Rafique Ahmed,
[22:48] And from family background,
[22:50] we were not the people who used to
do minimum wage work.
[22:53] We’re wealthy for generations.
[22:57] That’s why after my one son,
[22:59] sister has decided to make my other son
part of her family as well.
[23:09] I wish I didn’t care about the community,
[23:13] I would’ve said no.
[23:15] But being part of a respectable community,
my tongue is locked.
[23:19] Mother, don’t worry,
[23:22] Rania will make everything alright,
don’t take the stress.
[23:26] If what Rania has said doesn’t happen,
then make arrangements for yourself.
[23:30] You know I got a 1.5 tolah ring made
for my daughter-in-law.
[23:35] With a real ruby engraved,
it’ll tell its value later.
[23:43] So sister, call our child Rabail,
[23:46] so I could give her something.
Two things that are rightfully her.
[23:51] First this ring, second Khawar.
[23:55] Then she is free to do whatever
she wants with the two of them.
[24:02] Go, Seema, get her.
[24:05] Sure.
[24:07] Good luck.
[24:09] Do you understand?
[24:19] What do you think,
he is going to say no?
[24:21] If God wills.
[25:08] Come on, brother, let’s go.
[25:11] Come on.
[25:12] Come on sister.
[25:34] Here you go my child Khawar,
[25:37] give her the ring.
[25:43] Father, no.
[25:47] What? What brother Khawar?
What no?
[25:50] What?
[25:52] Grandmother? No.
[25:56] Our brother-in-law is very humorous.
[25:59] Say clearly brother-in-law, what no?
[26:02] He’s being shy, my child is very shy.
[26:07] Being shy about giving his bride the ring.
[26:11] If his heaven-resident mother were alive,
[26:14] she would’ve given this ring
to her daughter-in-law.
[26:18] But no problem, I’m his father.
[26:22] I can give this ring to my daughter-in-law.
[26:33] Here my child,
give me your hand.
[26:37] Do something, do something,
do something.
[26:50] Uncle.
[26:54] What are you doing uncle?
[26:58] It doesn’t happen like this in rich
and elite families,
[27:01] they consider it very inappropriate.
Yes.
[27:03] Brother Khawar was saying something.
[27:05] Brother Khawar, speak up.
[27:06] What were you saying?
Speak up Khawar.
[27:08] Say clearly, clearly.
[27:12] I, am ending this relationship.
[27:33] What are you saying Khawar?
[27:36] How can you even think about this?
[27:40] Leave it, Rafique Ahmed,
[27:43] the matters of marriage aren’t a
game of dolls.
[27:49] Agreements of our children are important,
we should listen to them.
[27:54] And it’s good that he told us on time.
[27:57] Well-done brother Khawar,
well done.
[28:00] Enough, take this cartoon away
from my sight.
[28:04] Or else.
[28:05] Or else, what if I as a brother
get angry and I.
[28:09] No.
No, Mahir.
[28:11] Let go, let go of me.
No, no.
[28:13] Uncle, I think you should leave now.
[28:16] Go home and take some rest.
[28:18] And give me your word, you won’t say
anything to this sweet brother of mine.
[28:21] He probably likes someone else,
it’s okay.
[28:25] Sister, why are you not angry?
[28:29] I’m concerned.
[28:31] Is this calm an indication of the storm?
[28:36] No, Rafique Ahmed,
there is nothing like that.
[28:41] Actually I’m a respectable woman,
so I understand the delicacy of relationships.
[28:47] And also our child Saman is your
daughter-in-law, and she’s happy.
[28:54] That’s all we care about.
[28:58] You’re great sister, you’re great.
[29:03] But this characterless son of mine
[29:06] has turned my respect into dust
in front of you.
[29:11] Now let us leave.
[29:13] Yes, yes.
[29:14] Come on, you shameless, come.
[29:17] Bye.
Let’s go.
[29:19] Bye.
Bye.
[29:47] Careful brother, let it stop first.
[29:51] Oh God, how sparkling it looks.
[29:54] It’ll be so much fun.
[30:01] Hey, hey sister, give me my fare,
I have to go somewhere else.
[30:05] Oh God, what’s the problem?
[30:09] Khawar, I didn’t expect this from you.
[30:14] Father I didn’t expect this from me either.
[30:16] Actually I really tried not to say no
but I got the strength and said it out loud.
[30:20] I’ll tell you about this strength
as we reach home.
[30:25] Drivers, bring all the cars.
Fast.
[30:29] Grandmother.
My daughter, my Rabail.
[30:33] Were about to get engaged.
[30:36] It’d for the better,
it’s for the better.
[30:38] People will make rumors,
they’ll draw conclusions.
[30:42] How many people would we answer?
[30:44] Grandmother who will marry me now?
[30:51] Aunt, aunt,
[30:53] it’s a great chance,
take advantage of it.
[30:57] What are you thinking? This offer
is only limited for a few seconds.
[31:01] Grandmother is very emotional right now.
[31:03] She’ll agree on another proposal instantly.
[31:07] What are you thinking? Don’t use
too much of your mind, come on.
[31:11] Come on, come on, come on.
Start with the name of God.
[31:12] Come.
[31:13] No, no, don’t think like this.
Mother?
[31:17] Yes?
[31:18] I want to ask Rabail ’s hand
in marriage for my Farhad.
[31:21] Believe us,
[31:23] we won’t draw conclusions
nor will we taunt.
[31:28] What?
[31:29] How?
[31:31] We don’t know you people, your cast,
or your background.
[31:36] The ones who came forward to honor
our daughter in such a time
[31:40] must be from a high background.
[31:43] And then, our girl will be spared of
people’s taunts and pointless stories.
[31:50] Think about it grandmother,
[31:52] every second person will point
their finger at our girl.
[31:55] They’d say, there must be
some probably with her,
[31:57] that’s why even that
cartoon Khawar rejected her.
[32:01] No, no.
[32:02] Look at them,
[32:04] those women are already gossiping,
grandmother, do something.
[32:12] Okay look,
[32:14] if you’re not satisfied with it then okay.
[32:17] Oh, no, no, no, no, aunt,
what happened?
[32:21] Actually we’re the girl’s family,
so a little hesitation is justified.
[32:24] Because we could never find
a match better than Farhad.
[32:28] Right, grandmother?
[32:30] Grandmother, don’t think too much,
[32:33] just make up your mind
and decide.
[32:37] We can’t find a better match
than Farhad.
[32:40] Grandmother, say something,
grandmother.
[32:43] Speak up.
Say it, grandmother.
[32:45] Say it, grandmother.
Speak up.
[32:49] Grandmother.
I accept.
[32:57] Play the music.
[33:04] Thank you so much grandmother.
[33:20] What are you people doing here?
[33:23] You are not invited?
[33:26] Rania is really nice,
[33:27] she invited me right away to the event
of Rabail and Farhad.
[33:31] And you’re relatives at least.
[33:33] It’s okay if you weren’t invited,
follow me I’ll let you people in.
[33:38] What did she just say?
[33:40] Farhad and Rabail’s engagement?
[33:44] Father, she’s stupid,
she just said some rubbish.
[33:47] No, no, no, no, they’re still playing
the music inside.
[33:52] We’ve left the engagement,
why are they still playing the songs?
[33:55] Come let’s go and
see what’s happening.
[34:01] Dabeer,
[34:02] did someone die back in Pakistan?
[34:05] A funeral?
[34:07] If not pretty enough at least
say something nice.
[34:09] What do you mean?
[34:10] I was just saying Madam Sweetie,
[34:13] that God has blessed you
with such a beautiful face,
[34:17] use it to say something beautiful.
[34:20] Oh, your tongue is working fine.
[34:23] That means nobody died in Pakistan.
[34:25] Then why do you seem so upset?
[34:29] Leave that, tell me, where are you going
with so much makeup?
[34:34] We only get one day off a weekend,
a person could spend that at home.
[34:39] A person is sitting here to spend
the weekend at home.
[34:42] I can’t do that, I get so many offers
for lunch and dinner.
[34:46] Today my friend invited me
for dinner so I said yes.
[34:49] Yes, why not, go ahead,
go with your friends.
[34:53] Enjoy the life,
[34:54] I’d suggest if any friend of yours asks you
to stay over for 3-4 days,
[34:59] you can stay there for 3-4 days,
[35:01] I don’t have any problem with that.
[35:03] I am not one of those husbands
[35:05] who think of their wives as their property.
[35:09] A person should have properties to think
of their wife as a property.
[35:14] Here, a freeloader got a landlady.
[35:16] Okay listen, I’m going out,
[35:19] lock all the doors and the windows,
it’s really cold outside.
[35:23] If you get cold and catch pneumonia,
then I won’t spare you in the morning.
[35:28] Don’t scare me.
Bye.
[35:29] Go safely.
[35:31] Thank God. The witch has left,
[35:33] this woman scares the hell out of me.
[35:37] Here we go, Dabeer,
[35:39] this witch will return 3-4 hours later,
[35:46] it’s the right opportunity to look for your passport,
where did she hide it?
[35:50] But man my brain doesn’t work,
[35:54] I should do this,
I should think like sweetie,
[35:59] where could she hide?
[36:03] That’s a good idea, Dabeer.
[36:06] Okay then,
become Sweetie.
[36:10] I look like sweetie.
[36:12] Now I should look with sweetie’s mind,
where she must’ve hidden my passport.
[36:17] Let’s see.
[36:36] And tell me,
which ring should I give?
[36:38] Mother, the one I gave you.
[36:41] So that’s why you got me the ring.
