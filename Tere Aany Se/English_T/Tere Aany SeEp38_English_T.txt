[01:03] What is it?
[01:05] Nothing.
[01:06] Go and play, don’t stand here
[02:06] This time you have hurt
my heart, Rania.
[02:25] Buddy, are you mad?
[02:27] There everyone is waiting for you,
[02:29] and you instead of getting ready,
sitting and smiling.
[02:33] Even Mr. Hammad has called four times.
[02:36] I am coming. Come on.
[02:38] and listen, get ready, look at your get up.
[02:42] I am fine this way.
[02:44] You cannot improve, man. Come on.
[03:07] Rania,
[03:10] I don’t see Ayaz.
[03:13] Yes, because he is not here.
[03:15] Why is he not here?
Go and check.
[03:18] Hey Bebo, don’t ask me
to do anything right now.
[03:22] Don’t go, just sit here.
[03:35] Ayaz is here,
see he has such a long life.
[03:39] Are you mad?
Sit here quietly.
[03:42] You are going to get married
in a few days.
[03:44] Act a little that
you are feeling shy.
[03:47] Hey brother,
your son in law is here.
[03:50] Come. Come my son
[03:52] he looks so good.
[03:54] Greetings.
Greetings.
[04:00] Live long, how are you?
[04:02] Absolutely fine. Absolutely fine.
[04:03] So give the gift that you brought with
so much love, why are you feeling shy?
[04:07] Gift?
[04:14] For you Mian Jee.
[04:22] Okay fine.
[04:23] Son, your coat is unbuttoned,
button it up.
[04:26] Yes, sir. Yes sir.
All of them?
[04:29] Seema, what do you do?
what do you do?
[04:31] that poor thing had brought the flower
for Bebo and not for Mian Jee.
[04:35] Why did you have
to make an entry?
[04:37] Their romance was about to start,
you ruined it.
[04:41] Don’t lecture me.
[04:42] Have you ever cared about your wife?
Given her any importance?
[04:45] Then why should I care
about the emotions of others?
[04:49] It is ruined, okay?
[04:52] Fix it.
[05:04] I would say don’t waste
the opportunity,
[05:06] express your love
[05:08] Yes, I don’t waste the opportunity
and express my love,
[05:11] and she will go in front of everyone
and tell them about the bet,
[05:13] and whatever respect
I have left it will be ruined too.
[05:16] You don’t know Rania, Honey.
[05:19] Brother, what do you want,
then?
[05:21] I want that Rania accepts
my love with her heart.
[05:26] Even if she says no
on the face of it,
[05:29] but her eyes tell me
what is in her heart.
[05:35] Impossible. Nothing like
that can happen.
[05:38] You just start crying
on your failed love.
[05:41] Man, you..
Guys, relax.
[05:43] Don’t lose hope.
[05:45] I have told you that
I will resolve this issue.
[05:48] Honey, you are all talk
and no walk.
[05:52] Since you have come you have been
saying you will fix it,
[05:53] I will just tell you the plan,
you have nothing.
[05:55] Shhh…let me think.
[05:58] What is she doing?
[06:09] I was thinking that on the occasion
of fixing Mona and Khaver’s date,
[06:13] we fix Ayaz and Asma’s wedding date.
[06:17] What do you elders think?
[06:20] Rania, tell her no.
[06:22] I don’t want to get married right now.
[06:24] First I will have the engagement
with a big celebration,
[06:25] then I will think about the marriage.
[06:27] Then say no yourself.
Thankless people.
[06:30] She is getting married and
she still is showing tantrums.
[06:31] No, it is a good thought. Yes.
[06:34] What do you say, sister?
[06:35] Should we not at least fix Asma
and Ayaz’s date?
[06:42] Hey, I would say that don’t delay
something good.
[06:47] Let brother Rafiq Ahmad come,
then we will fix everything.
[06:52] I don’t know where he is. Child,
Rania, call Saman and…
[06:56] Yes, I will just call, mama.
[06:57] Ask her where they are.
[06:59] Mian Jee, I am sure he must be standing
at a sweet shop that sells organic sweets.
[07:06] He is a show off, upstart.
[07:09] Mama, I feel Khaver is washing his face
with a dish washing soap,
[07:16] that is why he got late.
[07:19] I want to clean your face
with the same too.
[07:22] Don’t you dare say anything about
my future brother in law.
[07:25] Do you understand?
[07:26] I need to fix the teeka.
Let me fix the teeka.
[08:21] If he likes this girl so much,
[08:23] then why did he say no
to getting married.
[08:25] They are always together.
[08:33] These three are conspiring against me.
[08:37] They are Mahir’s friends,
so they will try to make him win.
[08:41] It is decided,
[08:43] Mahir can never improve.
[08:51] Just try to make Rania believe
your love for the last time.
[08:56] If she says no,
[08:58] then, I will start my drama.
[09:00] Done.
[09:01] Thank you, man.
[09:02] Thank you so much Honey,
you are really good.
[09:04] If mama finds out,
we will be in trouble.
[09:07] I am going to talk
to Rania right now,
[09:09] you people please pray for me.
[09:11] May God give me success.
[09:13] My boy,
[09:15] go put your hand in the bee hive,.
[09:23] Poor Mahir.
[09:26] He is not that poor.
[09:27] Come on, we have to support him too.
[09:36] Where are they?
[09:37] Why are they not here till now?
I will call and find out.
[09:54] Yes, okay, leave my hand.
[09:58] Rania can you come for a second,
[10:02] I want to talk to you about
something important.
[10:04] I don’t have time to waste,
go from here.
[10:06] Rania, just listen to me
for two minutes,
[10:08] I have to talk about
something important.
[10:10] I told you, I don’t want to talk to you.
Go from here.
[10:13] Bebo, ask her, please.
[10:15] Go. when he is saying he wants
to talk about something important,
[10:17] then go listen to him.
[10:19] What is the problem?
I don’t want to hear it.
[10:20] Rania, go and listen to him.
[10:24] Okay.
[10:25] Thank you. Thank you.
Come on.
[10:29] Listen, have you not seen Mahir
behaving weirdly with Raina?
[10:41] Hey, I didn’t focus on that,
[10:44] but I have thought on the issue of making
both of them one in future.
[10:50] You have said something great,
[10:53] but didn’t you feel that there is a serious
misunderstanding between these two? Yes.
[10:59] Huh? Why?
[11:00] I have been trying to search
for the answer of this why.
[11:04] I will find out.
[11:08] Shehanshah, you don’t look good
sitting on this sofa.
[11:11] Go out, special guests are about to come,
bring them in.
[11:15] Hey Mona, what special guests?
[11:17] And do we need them
to inaugurate this place?
[11:19] What do you mean?
[11:21] It is my future in-laws.
Come on, be quick.
[11:24] Yes, so when are they coming
for the first time?
[11:26] They come daily,
why are you so excited?
[11:29] You will see the insults with
which mama will welcome them
[11:32] and they will consider
this their respect.
[11:34] Okay, enough.
No need for all this nonsense.
[11:36] Come on.
Come.
[11:41] Where is Mona going?
[11:43] She has gone mad.
[11:44] Hello.
[11:46] Hello everybody.
[11:48] This daughter in law of mine.
Hello.
[11:52] Hello.
[11:54] Hello.
[11:55] Hello everybody. Hello.
[11:58] Hello everybody.
[12:00] Oh Mian Jee. Mian Jee.
[12:03] Greetings. Mian Jee.
[12:05] Mian Jee, how are you? are you fine?
[12:07] I am fine. Is she the same?
[12:09] Yes. Yes. She is the same.
[12:13] Has she come for a function
at home or for the Oscars?
[12:16] I feel that she is coming
from the Oscars,
[12:19] she didn’t get it there, so now
she will receive the Oscars from us.
[12:23] She is acting like
she has to make a speech.
[12:27] Have a seat, Miss Sweetie.
[12:29] It is enough. Sit. Sit. Sit.
[12:32] Come, have a seat.
[12:38] Mama, I was saying that
[12:41] till brother Rafiq and everyone else
doesn’t come,
[12:43] I will go and rest.
[12:46] They are late anyway, when they come
I will come immediately.
[12:50] Sit down,
[12:51] don’t you see respectable
guests are here,
[12:54] or do you feel you don’t deserve
to sit with them?
[12:58] Sit down.
[13:00] Dabeer.
Yes, Sweetie?
[13:02] I think all the women of
your family are blind.
[13:05] Why? What happened?
[13:06] No one appreciated
my great gold jewellery.
[13:09] Oh leave them,
I am praising you.
[13:12] you look so good,
is it less?
[13:15] It is really less.
Understand?
[13:18] Viewers and listeners,
today’s respectable guests,
[13:22] uncle Rafiq and my future prince,
are arriving.
[13:26] You people become alert.
[13:29] Make her sit.
[13:30] Make her sit and have a glass of water.
[13:32] What does she mean that we should be alert?
Will there be an attack here?
[13:36] Hah.
[13:42] Brother, what was I saying?
[13:44] You two are talking about Mahir
and Rania, right?
[13:48] I too came to talk
about both of them.
[13:50] Huh?
[13:55] I told you I don’t want
to hear anything.
[14:00] Rania, please.
[14:03] I admit it was my fault.
[14:05] I realize it.
[14:07] I am also embarrassed
on the mistake I made.
[14:11] That is why I am apologizing to you.
[14:14] I am sorry.
[14:17] Please forgive me.
[14:18] Okay fine. Fine.
I heard you.
[14:22] I forgive you.
[14:26] You really forgive me
with your heart?
[14:30] Yes, this is my greatness
[14:33] and don’t talk to me
on this topic again.
[14:37] Oh God, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
[14:40] Thank you, Rania.
[14:41] You don’t know
[14:42] what a big favour you have done on me.
[14:45] Hey, I was thinking that someone stubborn,
uptight and arrogant girl will take some time.
[14:51] What if she gets stubborn.
[14:53] But thank God,
you agreed immediately.
[14:56] Yes.
[15:04] Rania, I love you.
[15:08] He is now on the real topic.
[15:11] This means my doubt was correct.
[15:13] This was what they were planning.
[15:16] Mahir, Honey and Salik were
talking about this and laughing.
[15:19] He wants me to say
I love you as well,
[15:22] but I wont get trapped.
[15:33] I love you.
[15:37] Where did this I love you come from?
[15:40] Where did it come from?
[15:45] Rania, why don’t you believe my love?
[15:49] What do I lack? Tell me.
[15:51] I am smart, I am intelligent,
I am a little handsome too.
[15:55] The man who comes in the dreams of
thousands of girl is accepting his love for you, man.
[15:59] Please agree. Okay.
See this, here.
[16:02] I am sitting on my knees
and proposing you.
[16:05] I love you.
[16:06] Please agree.
[16:08] Mr. Mahir,
[16:10] I am not as stupid as you think I am.
[16:14] So don’t speak this nonsense with me.
[16:17] and think a hundred times before
you say this nonsense to me.
[16:38] I think I will have to make her
admit on gun point.
[16:51] So Mian Jee and mama,
this is the real thing.
[16:58] Okay you did good,
[17:00] at least you told us everything honestly.
[17:05] What is this Mahir did?
[17:08] Rania has no fault.
[17:10] He has lost his trust himself.
[17:12] Yes, but Mahir knows that he was stupid,
he made a mistake.
[17:17] He is embarrassed, but
[17:21] will Rania agree now or not?
This is the thing.
[17:26] Never.
[17:51] Mian Jee.
Yes?
[17:53] Mama.
[17:54] There is a solution for this problem.
[17:56] If you want, I can tell you.
What? Go ahead.
[17:59] You people announce
my wedding with Mahir.
[18:03] What?
[18:05] What are you saying?
[18:21] I…this…
[18:23] this date fixing came in front suddenly.
[18:26] I couldn’t believe my ears.
[18:30] I felt I was dreaming.
[18:46] This sound?
[18:48] Did you call the orchestra
to celebrate the date fixing?
[18:52] No. The date has been fixed
in front of you.
[18:56] This orchestra, this noise,
this turmoil, I don’t like it at all.
[19:01] I am an introvert, someone
who stays quiet, listens to ghazals.
[19:05] I often sit wearing a shawl,
I warm my hands, basically.
[19:10] I feel some showoff has done this.
[19:32] If you didn’t invite these people,
then who invited them?
[19:37] Anyway, being happy in someone’s
happiness is also something good.
[19:42] Shall we go?
[19:43] It looks so good.
Yes.
[19:46] Papa, they will be impressed
with us, right?
[19:48] Hey, why wont they get impressed?
[19:50] No one in their seven generations would
have come so grandly to fix the date.
[19:56] Son, Arbab, get out
of the car and dance.
[20:01] Papa, they are my in-laws,
[20:04] I have some respect
in front of my in-laws.
[20:06] Hey I too am asking you to dance,
and not beg.
[20:11] Man…
Get off. Get off,
[20:13] come on. Come on.
Papa, man…
[21:03] Huh?
[21:05] Dabeer, what are you doing?
Is this a way?
[21:09] Learn something from your brother.
[21:11] Mama, once the drum starts beating,
I cannot control myself.
[21:18] You tell me, do you feel proud?
[21:20] I find it really good.
[21:22] You should have put some sense
in them, Saman.
[21:24] Is this the way to come
to get the date?
[21:28] Did you see your husband?
He looked like a monkey dancing.
[21:32] You could have put some sense
in him or no?
[21:34] Mama, you have sworn
to insult your sons in laws.
[21:38] It is fine.
[21:41] Arbab, you looked like
a fairy when dancing.
[21:46] Come on.
Come.
[21:49] Come.
Come.
[21:51] Come on, lets fix the date.
[21:56] Sister,
[21:58] you should have at least arranged garlands
for the respectable guests.
[22:04] Or you should have asked me,
[22:05] I would have gotten garlands
for everyone with me.
[22:08] Hey, what is the big deal in this?
[22:10] Dabeer, take a necklace from
your wife’s neck and put it in his neck.
[22:14] Okay mama.
[22:15] Give me one.
Give the small one.
[22:18] No. No sister.
Stop him.
[22:21] I didn’t mean that.
[22:23] You do something every time.
[22:27] Sit nicely like a man now.
[22:43] Respectable guests,
[22:44] on today’s great day,
[22:47] I want to make an important
announcement.
[22:50] That my beloved, prince like,
my grandson, Mahir Ahmed,
[22:56] I am fixing his wedding with my son Dabeer
and his wife Sweetie’s adopted daughter Honey.
[23:05] So now soon those two
will be engaged as well.
[23:11] Congratulations.
[23:15] Hey, sit down.
Sit and clap. Sit.
[23:21] Grandma, what are you saying?
[23:25] I admit my life is lonely.
[23:27] But fine,
[23:28] maybe this is my fate.
[23:31] So let my life be lonely.
[23:34] I told you the decision has been made,
it is over. That’s it.
[23:37] That’s it.
[23:38] But grandma,
what is the need for all this?
[24:02] My poor brother.
[24:04] He knew,
[24:05] no one would believe his love,
[24:08] that is why he agreed to the family
out of helplessness.
[24:25] Here you go, congratulations.
[24:29] It has been confirmed.
[24:33] The girl has gotten jealous badly hearing
about the news of the boy’s engagement.
[24:40] Congratulations.
[24:42] Congratulations to you too.
[24:43] Hey boys, why are you sitting?
[24:47] Dance. Dance a little.
Come on, get up.
[25:13] Oh my,
[25:15] look at this, why is Mahir
dancing madly like this?
[25:19] Oh, look at that sad girl.
[25:22] I didn’t expect this from Mahir.
[26:09] I love you.
[26:11] Where did this I love you come from?
[26:13] Where did it come from?
[26:18] Rania, why don’t you believe my love?
[26:22] What do I lack? Tell me.
[26:24] I am smart, I am intelligent,
[26:26] I am a little handsome too.
[26:28] The man who comes in the dreams of
thousands of girls is accepting his love for you, man.
[26:32] Please agree. Okay.
See this, here.
[26:35] I am sitting on my knees
and proposing you.
[26:37] I love you.
[26:39] Please agree.
[26:45] On today’s great day,
[26:47] I want to make an important
announcement.
[26:50] That my beloved, prince like,
my grandson, Mahir Ahmed,
[26:56] I am fixing his wedding with my son Dabeer
and his wife Sweetie’s adopted daughter Honey.
[27:06] So now soon those two
will be engaged as well.
[27:29] Oh,
[27:31] what are you doing here?
[27:34] Tsk. Tsk. Poor girl.
[27:36] I know you got jealous of my Honey
and Mahir’s engagement.
[27:41] I can see your face expressions.
[27:44] For you it would be better
[27:46] that you remove these expressions of yours.
[27:52] You go from here, I don’t want to talk to you.
[27:54] I too am not dying to talk to you,
[27:57] but remember one thing,
[27:59] that in future if you come around
my son in law in future,
[28:02] then you will see the worst in me.
Understand?
[28:05] Fix your tone.
[28:08] I am not used to this tone
and words like these.
[28:11] If I see you around Mahir again,
[28:15] then my tone and words will be
worse than this.
[28:20] If you weren’t Mrs. Dabeer,
[28:25] then you cannot imagine how my words
and tone could have been.
[28:30] I would have insulted you so badly that
you would have remembered all your life.
[28:33] Right now, remember, you are talking
to Zaman Ahmad’s daughter.
[28:40] If my daughter wants
[28:42] then she can hire ten boys like Mahir
on the salary they want for her company.
[28:48] Do you understand?
[28:54] Papa.
[28:56] I don’t want to go in front of
everyone inside.
[28:59] Lets go back please.
[29:01] What are you saying?
[29:04] Hey, only weak people run hiding
their face like this
[29:07] and if you get scared of what this cheap woman
said then you will be scared all your life.
[29:14] I am thinking I will talk
to brother Dabeer immediately
[29:17] and complain about
this woman’s behaviour.
[29:19] No,
[29:20] for my sake, you won’t do
anything like this.
[29:23] Okay fine, I won’t say anything,
now come on.
[29:25] Come on. Come on.
Come.
[29:33] Today was a great day today.
[29:37] First Mona’s wedding got fixed,
the date got fixed,
[29:43] Then our Mahir’s wedding also got fixed.
[29:47] Absolutely.
So now Asma and Ayaz are left.
[29:50] Lets fix their date too.
[29:54] Mama, finalize the date for
one month after Mona’s wedding?
[30:00] One month?
[30:02] No, no.
[30:03] Yes, brother you are right.
[30:05] it is really soon,
you will have to prepare.
[30:08] Take six months.
[30:09] Till then our children will also
have their summer vacations.
[30:12] So when am I ringing the bell
at the school of the children.
[30:15] I mean to say that where did the vacations
of the children come in between, sister?
[30:19] Brother, what do you want?
Not soon, nor late?
[30:22] Do you want to marry
our Bebo or not?
[30:24] Hey, how can be in greater hurry
than me?
[30:26] Ayaz. Ayaz,
[30:28] can you sit quietly for a minute.
[30:30] I mean this.
[30:32] Mama…
Yes?
[30:34] Is it possible that along
with Mona’s marriage,
[30:38] you also marry Asma?
[30:48] What do you think?
[30:50] As you order.
[30:51] What do you say, Zaman?
[30:53] As you people see fit,
[30:57] we can prepare for
the wedding in a week too.
[31:05] In a week?
[31:12] Hey, congratulations child.
[31:14] Yes, congratulations
to you too child.
[31:23] Congratulations to everyone.
[31:25] Yes, to everyone.
[32:03] My poor brother, he knew
[32:06] that no one would have
believed his love,
[32:09] that is why he agreed to the family
out of helplessness.
[32:13] What is the matter?
You don’t look happy.
[32:15] No…
[32:17] The decision is correct, right?
Yes.
[32:42] Sure?
[32:44] We have fulfilled our daughter’s
responsibility in my life time.
[32:50] Thank God.
[32:51] And Ayaz’s sister said
something so good.
[32:54] She said that,
[32:56] we don’t need any show, we don’t
need any dowry, end of story.
[33:00] They are smart people,
they are educated,
[33:02] they would have made such a decision.
What else?
[33:04] Absolutely right.
[33:05] Mian Jee, I too have made a decision
[33:08] and I hope you will appreciate
my decision.
[33:10] What is that decision?
[33:12] I have decided to fix
Rania’s proposal with Wasiq.
[33:33] Such a big decision suddenly?
[33:36] What is sudden in this, Mian Jee?
[33:38] I had mentioned it to you.
[33:40] No, I think you are being hasty, Zaman.
[34:05] What is the haste in this, Mian Jee?
[34:08] And I want such a great man
for my daughter.
[34:11] Now see, Dr. Wasiq is a sober man,
[34:15] he belongs to an affluent family,
[34:18] he is a qualified doctor, Mian Jee,
[34:20] and along with it
he owns a big property.
[34:22] Rania will stay really happy with him.
[34:24] Zaman, even now for you, property and
wealth have a lot of importance for you?
[34:31] Huh?
[34:32] I thought that your thinking would
have changed in all these years,
[34:35] you are the same man.
[34:37] I apologize, Mian Jee,
[34:39] but in the end money is the
greatest wealth,
[34:42] and this is the reality,
you cannot deny it.
[34:44] Zaman, ask Rania once.
[34:48] Hey, what do I ask Rania?
She is my daughter,
[34:51] I will think of the best for her.
[34:53] and she is a child,
what would she know?
[34:56] Whatever decision that has to be made,
has to be made by me.
[35:05] Huh?
[35:06] Uncle, I was saying that this Wasiq
of ours is a good boy.
[35:13] You think about your decision.
Okay?
[35:16] I am,
[35:18] I am thinking about it.
[35:41] I cannot believe that
you are the same Rania,
[35:45] who used to fight with anyone
in the village for their right,
[35:49] and today it is about your right,
so you are quiet.
[35:53] Who do I fight with?
[35:56] With papa? And what for?
[36:01] Look Rania,
[36:02] I am not a child.
[36:04] I know you don’t like Dr. Wasiq,
you…
[36:09] Enough Bebo,
[36:10] end this discussion here,
[36:13] there is no point.
