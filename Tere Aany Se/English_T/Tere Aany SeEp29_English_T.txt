[00:22] I wasn't there,
[00:26] who took care of grandfather?
[00:29] Don't worry Rania,
[00:32] God is great,
[00:35] he's aware of every pain we have,
[00:39] my brother's son came back,
[00:42] he'll take care of him.
[00:46] Sons are like arms for fathers,
[00:51] their brilliance and their hope.
[00:56] Now you'll see,
[00:58] my Anwar will have different mannerisms.
[01:03] What are you talking about grandmother?
[01:07] Daughter Rania, I want to tell you a story,
[01:12] it's a long story
[01:15] but you have to hear it with patience.
[01:18] Grandmother,
you're seeing her poor condition,
[01:21] she's not in the situation
to hear a story.
[01:23] You just drive the car,
don't say anything,
[01:26] instead you should think about Sweetie
and what to do with her.
[01:30] I'm running out of patience with her I'll ask
Dabeer to send her back to America.
[01:37] You were telling me something
grandmother.
[01:40] Rania
[01:43] I want to tell you that,
[01:47] your father,
[01:48] Anwar's son,
[01:52] he's alive and well.
[01:57] And he's at Anwar's home.
[02:11] What are you saying, grandmother?
[02:18] My father?
[02:23] Yes my child,
[02:27] your father is alive and well.
[02:39] He just made a really big mistake
[02:42] that he left everyone behind chasing
after his dreams.
[02:55] But he must've realized
[02:59] that even after getting everything
he's empty-handed,
[03:05] because his people are far away
from him.
[03:15] No,
[03:17] how is this possible?
[03:21] I cannot accept this,
[03:24] how can someone do this?
[03:27] How can someone be so selfish
[03:30] that he leaves his blood relations
for the sake of wealth?
[03:40] Grandmother,
I feel strange to hear this,
[03:44] a man can leave his father,
his wife, his sister,
[03:51] and even his own child for the sake of
wealth and luxury.
[03:58] That means not even a single relationship
could hold him back?
[04:03] How can someone forgive
a man like this?
[04:08] I cannot forgive him, no.
[04:13] But grandmother,
there is something to think about,
[04:16] why did they lie to Rania?
[04:19] There are a lot of fathers
who walk away from their families
[04:21] then why did they tell her
that her father isn't alive.
[04:28] His son's disobedience crushed Anwar,
[04:35] so he declared his living son dead,
[04:42] because he was really angry
[04:45] and he decided he won't even
look at his son's face.
[04:53] He must've thought
[04:55] he should protect Rania
from this agony,
[04:58] who'll be living her life without a father
even when her father is alive.
[05:08] I can still feel that agony today,
[05:11] it would've been better if they had
just told me the truth.
[05:15] Why am I tested like this
for no reason?
[05:20] Life is a name of tests and trials,
[05:27] you're fortunate that you're a grandchild
to someone like Anwar,
[05:32] who never let you feel the absence.
[05:38] My child, not you
[05:40] but your grandfather needs a support.
[05:51] Your mother and your aunt forgave
your father with a big heart,
[05:58] your grandfather opened the door of
his heart and his house for his son,
[06:05] and now you want to push him
back to sadness
[06:10] and disappointment again
with your reactions.
[06:16] You're a child,
[06:19] you don't understand the demands
of the times and situations.
[06:24] Whatever decision your elders made,
[06:27] listen to it quietly and accept it.
[06:34] My child I understand
it's not easy for you
[06:39] but you have to accept the reality
for the sake of your grandfather.
[06:48] It's not like your father didn't try to come
and apologize in past years,
[06:55] he came
[06:57] but now he got forgiveness.
[07:06] Come on my child,
[07:09] forgive your father with a big heart,
[07:15] humans make mistakes.
[07:20] Mahir why did you stop the car? Drive,
[07:23] we have to reach there on time,
[07:25] Anwar must be waiting
for his granddaughter,
[07:29] let's go.
Yes.
[08:19] Thanks a ton to God
[08:22] that father's condition is
a little better now.
[08:27] Asia,
[08:32] have you really forgiven me Asia?
[08:43] And my daughter?
[08:45] Will she forgive me too?
[08:51] I don't know,
[08:55] I talked to the sister, she's coming
[08:58] so you can ask by yourself.
[09:01] Thanks a million to you my Creator,
[09:08] I'm really restless to meet my daughter.
[09:14] Well Zaman,
[09:17] didn't you think about it
a little too late?
[09:23] You throw me and my daughter aside
while leaving,
[09:28] if it weren't for uncle,
[09:32] we would've jumped in a river.
[09:40] Asia,
[09:44] I made a big mistake.
[09:49] My daughter and I bore
the consequences of that mistake.
[09:55] I also bore the consequences
of that mistake,
[09:59] I'll explain everything
when we'll have time.
[10:03] Then do the reckoning,
who was at loss.
[10:08] Zaman,
[10:11] you reaped what you sow,
[10:16] my daughter and I were punished
for the crime we didn't commit.
[10:26] I'll do anything to make up
for that mistake.
[10:31] I promise you
[10:33] I won't let any worry or
sorrow come near you.
[10:42] Let it be,
[10:45] all your attempts will be nullified,
[10:49] but I've forgiven you by moving past
all your mistakes,
[10:57] just don't expect anything else from me.
[11:20] Greetings.
[11:21] Greetings greetings.
[11:24] Won't you meet grandfather?
[11:32] How is my brother?
[11:35] He's better than before.
[11:37] Come on.
[11:41] Rani,
[11:47] Rani
[11:50] I'm seeing you back at home
after such a long time.
[11:55] Father is only waiting for you,
[11:59] if not for yourself then forgive my brother
for the sake of father.
[12:25] Rania,
[12:27] let's go inside,
[12:30] father and brother are waiting for you.
[12:34] But I'm not waiting for anyone,
[12:37] I don't want to meet anyone,
[12:41] please leave me alone for a while.
[12:50] Come on.
[13:51] Where is my brother Anwar?
[13:54] Where is he, where is my brother?
[13:57] Hey whose evil eye affected him?
[14:00] That my brother is bedridden.
[14:04] Greetings.
Greetings.
[14:07] How are you my child,
how is my brother?
[14:10] Better.
[14:11] Okay okay.
Greetings Aunt.
[14:15] Zaman, live long my child,
live long.
[14:18] You're fine? How are you?
I'm alright,
[14:22] what could happen to
an unfortunate like me.
[14:25] You're fortunate that you came back home
before the evening.
[14:31] To be honest I was mad at you
[14:34] but if my brother has forgiven you
then I've forgiven you as well.
[14:39] And this is, my grandson Mahir,
[14:43] son of Dabeer.
[14:45] Aunt, tell me, my daughter didn't come?
[14:50] She did,
[14:52] but she's sitting outside,
[14:53] she's upset to know about your arrival.
[14:57] I'll see.
[15:04] Aunt come, take a seat.
[15:07] He's that, doctor's father,
[15:11] which means Dr. Wasiq
is Rania's stepbrother?
[15:17] That's what we call
a beautiful coincidence.
[15:22] Bebo, Bebo, Bebo,
he's your biological brother?
[15:25] Yes.
[15:26] He's Rania's father? Biological father.
Yes.
[15:30] Thanks to God.
[15:32] The happiness I got by
meeting him today,
[15:35] I can't even describe.
[16:16] Hey, Rania,
[16:20] what are you doing here?
I was.
[16:39] That means,
you are my daughter.
[16:57] Rania, this is Dr. Wasiq's father.
[17:00] Hey, father, this is Rania,
[17:03] she agreed to come on my one call,
on my request.
[17:05] She decorated the whole ward,
[17:07] in fact, helping me keep children happy
and making them smile.
[17:11] You're doing a great job.
[17:14] Because only the people who spread
happiness deserves to be called human.
[17:20] You're definitely a great girl,
[17:22] your parents taught you well.
[17:32] My child.
[17:34] Don't say anything,
[17:37] I won't hear a word.
[17:42] If I knew
[17:46] you are my father
who came alive,
[17:54] I would have never met you
[17:57] nor would I come here.
[18:03] My child, listen to me.
[18:06] I've heard everything you have to say,
[18:10] now I have realized,
[18:13] I don't have what it takes
to forgive you.
[18:29] Rania.
[18:30] Mahir, Mahir I have to go back,
I can't stay here please take me back.
[18:34] Please hold yourself.
[18:36] No I can't stay here why don't you understand,
please take me back.
[18:39] Okay okay, we'll go back,
you just came here,
[18:43] go and meet your grandfather.
[18:45] No, I don't want to meet anyone,
please.
[18:47] Please take me back.
Okay okay, you call yourself strong,
[18:53] then prove that,
[18:55] please contain yourself,
go and meet your grandfather,
[18:58] go.
[19:12] She is going through a very
difficult phase in her life,
[19:16] give her some time and
she will be fine.
[19:51] Rani,
[19:54] Rani get up.
[19:57] Why did everyone tell me
that my father is dead?
[20:03] What else we could have said?
[20:06] The person who breaks all the ties
with their family,
[20:10] that person dies.
[20:13] How can you say that
we that wrong Rani?
[20:18] When I believed he died then
how can I accept that he's alive?
[20:25] You didn't do right by me,
[20:30] you people cannot understand
what I am going through,
[20:33] you people can never understand.
[20:41] Only I know the condition of my heart,
[20:45] nobody else knows.
[20:55] Rani,
[20:57] father is waiting for you,
[21:01] he has forgiven my brother,
[21:07] please don't say anything
that makes him worried again.
[21:14] He's satisfied with the return of his son,
[21:19] don't do anything to make
dissatisfaction his fate again.
[21:28] Rania, we've forgiven him
for the sake of father,
[21:33] we can't trouble him more
in this age and condition.
[21:40] And I know you will understand
our situation.
[22:00] Cap.
[22:03] It's imported,
[22:05] I've brought all this stuff
for you from America.
[22:09] But it says "made in Sahiwal".
[22:13] Yes, Sahiwal,
[22:16] Sahiwal is a name of a city in America,
it was made there.
[22:20] It must be very expensive.
[22:22] Cap.
[22:28] Perfume, with fragrance.
[22:33] And now I'll give you the biggest gift.
[22:39] Dollars.
[22:42] For me?
Yes.
[22:46] It's heavy must be real, sister,
you're sweet just like your name.
[22:52] We'll count it later,
it'll take a week.
[23:08] Brother, I'm really happy,
[23:11] congrats to you on Zaman's return.
[23:15] Now that your son is back,
you're not alone,
[23:19] he'll be your support.
[23:23] My child, come sit here, sit here.
[23:34] Sister told you all the reality.
[23:39] Yes.
[23:42] Did you meet your father?
[23:47] Yes,
[23:52] I met him,
[23:55] but nobody can take
your place grandfather,
[24:03] you’re like a father to me
[24:07] and grandfather as well.
[24:12] Thanks to him that
he came to meet you,
[24:15] we wouldn’t have died if didn’t come.
[24:21] We’ve spent so much of our lives,
[24:24] we could’ve spent the rest as well.
[24:27] My child your resentment is justified,
[24:32] then complain to him,
[24:36] express your anger so he’ll know.
[24:43] What complaint?
[24:46] Resentment for what?
[24:51] You spoilt me and you were the one
who fulfilled my dreams.
[24:58] I wasn’t left empty that
I complain to him.
[25:07] Your love always fulfilled me,
[25:15] I have no complaints from anyone.
[25:28] Okay then.
[25:39] What do I tell you Salik,
[25:42] the one I used to think of
as my enemy and rival,
[25:46] ended up being my future brother-in-law.
[25:49] Interesting, that’s a very filmy situation,
isn’t it?
[25:52] I wish I were there too,
it would be fun.
[25:55] Brother, you accepted or not,
all this help is from the God.
[25:59] Well it was a very emotional scene,
[26:02] poor Rania was very surprised
and shocked,
[26:05] but my heart was dancing,
[26:08] I wanted to dance to the music.
[26:13] The danger I always had of Dr. Wasiq,
who could it be?
[26:18] Rania’s elder step-brother.
[26:23] That means my future brother-in-law.
[26:26] Now that you’re my brother,
take this advice from me,
[26:29] anyhow win the heart of your father-in-law,
[26:32] then you’ll see the girl
will agree inevitably.
[26:36] Currently my father-in-law is taking
his daughter’s resentment,
[26:40] just let the matters settle for once
then you’ll see,
[26:44] now I’ll impress uncle with my manners
and obedience.
[26:50] But there is one problem.
[26:52] What now?
[26:54] Since the arrival of my step-mother,
[26:56] I got poor,
[26:58] and since the return of this uncle
Rania got rich.
[27:02] I hope my poverty doesn’t make me
an unsuccessful lover.
[27:05] No worries, there will be a solution
for that as well, don’t worry.
[27:18] Sister, I told everyone that Madam Sweetie
invited everyone.
[27:24] I don’t know what kind of people they are,
it’s morning already and they’re still sleeping.
[27:28] They don’t have anything to do,
they’re very stubborn.
[27:34] Sweetie, what fits you’re throwing
so early in the morning?
[27:39] You could have used your mind,
it’s a day of everyone is resting.
[27:43] You should also rest for God’s sake
and let us rest as well.
[27:46] Listen to me
[27:47] if your mother isn’t home
[27:50] that doesn’t mean
the sun won’t rise on us,
[27:52] nobody will wake up and
won’t do anything.
[27:54] This is not happening.
[27:56] Yes Sweetie?
[27:59] Did you call?
[28:01] Today is the day off so Mona and
I am taking the kids to the Zoo.
[28:05] Why do you need to go to a zoo?
[28:07] This house is a zoo itself,
[28:09] just look at your face in the mirror
you will understand.
[28:16] Now watch your faces later,
[28:19] first of all, everyone makes a queue,
[28:20] come on, stand in a straight line.
[28:22] Dabeer.
Yes.
[28:24] You too, go make a queue.
Yes, I’m going to make a queue.
[28:27] Shehenshah, you didn’t hear that?
Get on, come on fast.
[28:30] Shehenshah will stay here,
here you go have the juice.
[28:33] Come on, madam.
You made a queue?
[28:36] Make a queue.
Move aside.
[28:38] Come on, come on fast.
Come, make a queue.
[28:42] We’ve made a queue Sweetie.
[29:08] Dabeer, from today onwards you’ll iron
all the clothes in this house,
[29:13] do you understand?
[29:14] And you, lazy person,
[29:17] you’ll go get the groceries
for the house,
[29:19] you’ll go right now and on foot, okay?
[29:22] Seema, you’ll complete all the house chores
and exactly 2 hours,
[29:26] not more, not less, exact 2 hours,
understand?
[29:30] And you, go outside and
water the plants,
[29:33] each plant in the garden
should be watered.
[29:36] And you, imaginary princess,
[29:38] go to the kitchen and
wash all the dirty dishes,
[29:41] dishes from dinner last night
are still in the sink, go.
[29:44] Excuse me, you don’t know who I am,
[29:48] I am the only beautiful wife
of such a wealthy man,
[29:51] if I wash the dishes it’ll be
an insult to my in-laws.
[29:55] That’s going to happen or pack your bags
and go back to your real home,
[30:01] and I’ll call your in-laws to tell them
[30:03] that this alien has nothing to do with us,
do you understand?
[30:07] Brother Dabeer,
[30:09] you’re heading all this,
why are you not saying something?
[30:11] Dabeer has got blisters in his mouth,
he won’t be able to speak,
[30:15] do you understand?
[30:16] And all of you, listen to me clearly,
[30:19] I’ve seized mother-in-law’s place now,
[30:22] and even mother-in-law herself
can’t get this back.
[30:25] Do you all understand?
[30:27] So it’s better for all of you
to behave well,
[30:29] or I’ll make you better with
my own hands, understand?
[30:35] And only the one who has been through
this can understand what it’s like, yes.
[30:42] Dismissed.
[30:54] She’s not the one
who could benefit anyone,
[30:57] I made a big mistake,
[30:58] I was persuading this arrogant woman
for no reason,
[31:02] she’s an unkind woman, dangerous.
[31:04] Let mother come back,
[31:05] I’ll apologize for my treachery
and join mother’s group.
[31:17] Dabeer?
[31:18] Yes, yes, yes, Sweetie.
[31:21] This seat has a lot of power,
[31:24] and power has its own distinguished taste.
[31:28] It might, Sweetie,
if you say so.
[31:32] But I never had the taste of power
so how would I know?
[31:37] Listen to me,
[31:38] before your mother returns,
[31:41] there has to be a golden nameplate with
my name outside this house, understood?
[32:11] Oh hi, May I come in?
[32:15] Do you need something?
[32:16] No, there is nothing.
[32:20] Then why did you come to my room?
[32:23] Randomly, to see how you are doing,
[32:25] is your anger still the same
or did it get better
[32:29] That’s none of your problem,
you shouldn’t have come to my room.
[32:33] Why, why is there a problem with that?
[32:37] I mean what would he think of you
what would he think if he saw you here.
[32:44] Oh,
[32:46] that means what he thinks,
[32:50] what his opinion is,
it matters to you.
[32:54] Oh,
[32:56] thank God,
[32:57] which means your anger finally settled,
[32:59] so the family was worried for no reason.
[33:01] Wait, let me go and tell them.
[33:03] No, wait,
[33:05] don’t say anything to anyone.
[33:08] I was angry then, I’m angry now.
[33:22] Rania,
[33:27] what good is the anger
[33:29] that only harms you,
[33:34] you should be happy instead that
your grandfather found his long-lost son
[33:41] and see how he got better
since he met his son.
[33:46] You don’t know anything,
you shouldn’t speak so much,
[33:50] and getting angry is my right.
[33:53] I also have feelings,
[33:56] I also have a heart.
[33:58] Well, can I say something?
[34:01] It’s good that you didn’t become
the prime minister,
[34:04] if you were you would be
the prime minister of children.
[34:10] Dude, you’re just like a child,
very immature.
[34:15] Why are you laughing so much,
[34:17] and listen, don’t call me dude
or child here,
[34:20] I already don’t like this informality,
[34:23] do you understand?
Go away.
[34:26] Okay, okay, okay, express
all the anger you want,
[34:29] until you get out of this room,
[34:32] I’m not going anywhere,
I’m here.
[34:41] That,
[34:42] he was here to convey
grandfather’s message,
[34:44] he’s calling me so I should go.
[34:48] Why are you lying?
What message did I bring?
[34:52] She’s lying Bebo,
[34:54] since the morning
she’s locked in this room,
[34:57] I was worried for her,
[34:59] if she got sick or something,
right dude?
[35:03] Agian dude?
[35:04] I told you to not use
this word for me.
[35:06] Okay Rani,
[35:08] what’s there to get angry about it?
You could say it calmly as well.
[35:12] Leave it Bebo, let it be,
[35:14] she’s getting angry at me,
let her do it,
[35:18] and anyway a person
only gets angry at people
[35:21] he thinks he has a right over.
[35:23] Doesn’t matter Rania,
you have a right over me,
[35:26] express your anger.
What right? Which right?
[35:29] There is nothing like that running
in my mind, do you understand?
[35:34] Bebo
[35:36] I have decided that
I am going back to Lahore,
[35:38] if mother and Mahir want to stay here
then they should.
[35:41] Why would I stay here?
I am already getting bored here,
[35:45] I’ll tell grandmother to stay here
as long as she wants,
[35:48] Rania and I are going back to Lahore.
[35:51] Go wash your face,
I am not going back with you,
[35:56] I only came here with you because
I heard about grandfather’s condition.
[35:58] But I won’t go back, do you understand?
[36:05] Tell me one thing,
[36:07] did your niece have some
electric shock in childhood?
[36:12] Then why does the fuse of her brain
never work?
[36:15] We try to say one thing,
she understands some other.
[36:20] I can’t understand her.
[36:27] Okay leave all this,
tell me what is your progress?
[36:29] What do I say about the progress,
[36:33] currently this girl isn’t even calling her
father her father.
[36:37] What’s there to stress about it,
[36:39] if she doesn’t want to call him father
[36:40] then she can call him papa,
dad or pops,
[36:44] what’s to worry about?
[36:47] Dude the way you say senseless things
with so much confidence,
[36:51] I hate it.
[36:53] Okay okay,
why are you getting angry?
[36:55] Look, listen to something important,
[36:56] take advantage of the opportunity,
understanding?
[36:59] Grandfather and her father,
make a place in their heart,
[37:01] not heart, make a place in their minds.
[37:04] Force them to think
[37:06] that you are the boy
[37:08] who can bring spring into the life
of their daughter.
[37:11] Then let Rania show as much attitude
as she wants,
[37:13] she won’t be able to get
away from you.
[37:15] They say absolutely right,
dirty minds think alike,
[37:19] I also had the same planning
in my mind,
[37:21] that’s what I have to do.
[37:22] At least you did something smart,
[37:24] now take me to a dinner
at a nice restaurant,
[37:27] you made a bet or two that you lost.
[37:30] Really,
[37:32] I did lose the bet,
[37:34] but for the first time I’m happy to lose.
[37:37] I am surprised about my condition.
[37:39] Well-done, these are the symptoms
of true lovers my child.
[37:43] We are the old players of this game
and we know all of this.
[37:48] I don’t understand
[37:51] how did I fall in love with her,
[37:55] but I also get worried thinking
about one thing Salik.
[38:00] What if Rania rejects me?
[38:02] How can she reject you?
[38:04] We won’t play the shallow game,
we’ll plan every move properly.
[38:07] Just do one thing,
[38:09] don’t say “I love you”
if you get emotional,
[38:12] only focus on the family for now.
[38:14] Okay, okay, okay,
teacher Salik Ali khan,
[38:17] I’ll do exactly what you tell me.
[38:20] Okay now don’t waste your time
grandfather and father,
[38:24] butter them a little, look after them.
[38:27] And think, if they’ll consider a stupid
like you for their only daughter?
[38:31] What?
[38:32] Stupid?
[38:34] Who are you calling stupid?
[38:36] I called you, you crazy,
who could be more stupid than you,
[38:38] you went to make a girl
fall in love with you
[38:41] and you yourself are diving
into the Oceans of love.
[38:59] Hello?
[39:00] Greetings Asma,
how are you?
[39:03] How is your father’s condition now?
[39:06] Yes, he’s better now, thank God.
[39:10] Thank God, I was getting concerned
thinking about your worries.
[39:15] It was good to hear
[39:17] that my worries matter
that much to someone.
[39:20] Asma, I’ve decided to make you
mine wholeheartedly,
[39:25] I’ll walk beside you at every turn of life.
[39:30] I swear.
[39:32] If God wills, it’ll be like that.
[39:34] Just, as soon as the situation gets better
[39:37] then you can come here
along with your sister,
[39:40] I’ll wait for you.
[39:42] Really?
[39:44] Okay, bye.
[39:47] Bye.
