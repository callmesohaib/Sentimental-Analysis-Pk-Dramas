[00:16] I would say Rania’s father made a good
decision by not giving his sister’s proposal to Mr. Ayaz.
[00:21] Hey do these poor people have a life?
[00:24] Hey, I want the government
to ban the marriages of poor.
[00:28] Hey, this a game of rich people.
Rich people only.
[00:32] Hello. Hey wow,
today brother Khaver is also here.
[00:37] What is this?
[00:38] You still are not worried?
[00:40] I feel someone hasn’t taught you a lesson.
[00:43] No problem, I am here, I will remind you
that you have come to your future in-laws.
[00:48] May God get your marriage sorted soon,
I have to take revenge from you for everything.
[00:53] Okay, I have a really good news.
[00:56] My Mian Jee he can come into action like a hero of a film
and he has fixed the proposal of uncle and Bebo.
[01:04] What? Really?
[01:06] Do you hear that Khaver?
[01:08] Now I will need a new
dress on every event and yes,
[01:11] Mahir and Honey’s proposal
is also going to get fixed.
[01:14] We will have more functions, so more clothes.
I will dress up well in every function.
[01:19] What? What are you saying?
[01:22] I mean, Honey is aunt Sweetie’s relative,
so how can Mahir agree?
[01:28] Hey, I don’t have the answer
for all these questions.
[01:31] But both of them are well set,
[01:34] and on top of that Mahir
will not let go of such a rich proposal.
[01:38] Yes, this is what smart people do.
send Mahir, I will congratulate him a little.
[01:44] Hey, no, no, not right now.
We will congratulate him on the day of the engagement.
[01:49] Where are you going, Rania?
[01:51] Don’t you have to give everyone
the news of Bebo’s proposal?
[01:54] I told you, you tell everyone.
[01:58] Rania.
[02:00] I will immediately take Honey’s side.
[02:04] I have to take revenge from this damned Mahir.
[02:06] He has messed with a lot,
and I will mess with him double.
[02:09] Hey, be quiet.
[02:11] No one knows about this right now,
brother Hammad has told me not to tell anyone.
[02:14] Hey I don’t understand your brother Hammad.
[02:26] What is happening to me?
[02:28] I know it well that he doesn’t love me,
[02:35] so will I ruin my respect?
[02:38] I will plead for the sake of my love,
I will request him to have mercy on me,
[02:42] he should sympathize with me,
he should marry me?
[02:48] Damn you, Rania.
[02:51] You can live your life without love,
[02:54] but living without respect is
no less than a punishment.
[02:59] And I will never express my love and
give him a chance to laugh at me.
[03:05] After all, I have to go ahead.
[03:09] I have to become the prime minister of the country.
[03:20] What?
[03:21] Really?
[03:24] Meaning, her aunty has fixed
my proposal without asking me.
[03:29] Why? Who is she?
[03:31] Hey, if she fixes my proposal with the girl I like,
then I will say no to it in my stubbornness.
[03:36] She thinks so highly of herself.
[03:38] Okay, so I am not the girl you like?
[03:41] And you are saying this to my face?
[03:44] Have shame. Say sorry.
[03:47] Sorry. Sorry, but I didn’t mean that.
[03:50] Man, your aunty, she has made me face a lot of loss,
and I am not going to be fooled by any of her conspiracy.
[03:57] Meaning, I am so bad?
[03:59] No, Honey, it is not that.
[04:03] You are not the one I like.
[04:10] So who is the one you like?
[04:14] Yes so we too should know
who brother Mahir likes.
[04:23] Man, the one I like,
[04:27] right now she has gone far away from me
and the reason for that too is your aunty.
[04:34] She left me nowhere.
[04:36] Poor aunt Sweetie has no fault,
you are the one who left the battle field and went.
[04:41] But I understand well that you like Rania.
[04:45] We understand this,
but still you are not ready to admit it.
[04:48] You know, today Rania came
and she came so happy,
[04:52] but when she found out that you and
Honey’s proposal has been fixed, she went pale.
[04:58] She went back as sad as she came happy.
I stopped her a lot, but she didn’t stop. She left.
[05:13] She must have gotten upset on something else,
you have a misunderstanding.
[05:17] Hey, I am not stupid like you.
[05:20] Just like I know the secret of your heart,
just like that I know what is going on in Rania’s head.
[05:24] Honey is right.
[05:26] Come on, get up, take out the car,
we will go to Rania’s place right now.
[05:28] What for? Tell me as well, after all,
I broke this news. What happened?
[05:32] Brother, get up.
[05:37] Sir, this is the file with the bills.
[05:40] You always bring bills.
[06:11] Madam, tea.
[06:20] Rania, why are you so sad?
[06:23] Now Mian Jee has convinced your father,
for Ayaz. And Bebo too is really happy.
[06:30] I am also happy.
[06:32] Uncle Ayaz is a good man,
he will really keep Bebo happy.
[06:39] Sorry, if you are happy then
why don’t I see this happiness on your face?
[06:44] I…
[06:47] Bebo will go far from us, that’s why.
[06:52] I have heard that girls become
strangers after marriage.
[06:59] By the way Rania,
what did you think about yourself?
[07:04] What do you mean?
[07:05] Meaning, will you get married by your
liking or by the decision of your family?
[07:12] Marriage is not my priority,
[07:16] I have to do many other big things.
[07:18] After all,
[07:21] I don’t like anyone,
[07:23] so when the time comes
I will accept the decision of the elders.
[07:26] Really? Honestly?
[07:29] Yes, I wont get an award lying to you.
[07:33] after all, my Mian Jee can never
make a wrong decision for me.
[07:39] Madam Rania, madam is calling you.
[07:42] Okay, I will come.
[07:46] You people have tea, I will come.
[07:55] Doctor, you worry for no reason,
[07:59] the girl agrees and the girl’s father
he wont have any objection.
[08:05] Here, have my tea in this happiness.
No, what are you doing…
[08:08] Rania is okay.
[08:18] Sister, this Mian Jee and sister in law
are constantly staring at me.
[08:26] They are looking at me from every angle.
Do I look like a sight to them?
[08:34] There is nothing like that, sit quietly.
[08:41] Actually, the thing is,
I was talking to the child.
[08:45] I have a nephew,
we were talking about a girl for him.
[08:49] I went to the girl’s home.
[08:52] So I entered the girl’s home
and my feet stopped there.
[08:56] Sir, I think the water for the tea is boiling.
[09:00] I will go check on the tea myself instead of they see it.
[09:04] I will make first class tea with sweets.
I will come in two minutes.
[09:12] You will ask why?
[09:14] Yes, so Mian Jee, you were telling me that
your feet refused to move forward.
[09:20] Very interesting. Very interesting.
[09:23] The thing is I knew this doctor from earlier.
[09:28] Really?
[09:29] He was a man from our area, he was a registrar,
and he used to take bribes.
[09:35] Oh.
[09:36] So I thought that his grandfather is like that
and the affect will be in the kids.
[09:44] Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
[09:48] You don’t have any such
grandfather in your relatives, right?
[09:52] It is possible.
[09:54] Then forget about it.
This secret shouldn’t be told to anyone.
[09:57] I forgot it. Forgot it.
[09:59] Yes, Mian Jee, you made the right decision.
[10:04] You did the right thing,
blood shows its colours one day.
[10:33] Are you okay?
[10:35] You look worried.
[10:37] I am worried.
You know Mahir is in great difficulty.
[10:44] Rania, don’t you feel that
you are extra conscious for Mahir.
[10:51] I mean, you think about him a lot,
but he never takes you that seriously, I think.
[11:01] How he is and how he isn’t with me,
is my issue with him.
[11:05] Anyway, right now,
Mahir will be in a big trouble.
[11:10] You know his stepmother,
[11:12] she wants to fix her adopted
daughter’s proposal with Mahir forcefully.
[11:16] His life will be ruined.
[11:18] Rania,
[11:20] is Mahir a western girl,
tied up in chains of helplessness?
[11:25] He is a man and he can decide for himself.
He knows what is good or bad.
[11:31] If he wants to get married or not,
he will decide about this,
[11:35] why are you worried about this for no reason?
[11:37] Hey, I am worrying for no reason?
Yes.
[11:40] He is my cousin.
[11:41] When I can think for the good of every person,
then I will surely think for him.
[11:49] Do you want something?
[11:52] Yes, the children in
the hospital really miss you.
[12:20] Hey, the boy doesn’t know that
girls bring these trolleys and trays.
[12:29] He is an eastern boy.
Yes, eastern.
[12:31] Yes.
Yes, yes,
[12:34] it is the first time, so he is really excited.
[12:38] Son, what other work do you do?
[12:40] Sir, I can make round flat bread,
[12:43] I can also take out the scarfs that
get stuck in the chains of motorcycles.
[12:46] Sir, I can connect the wire of the cable.
Ayaz,
[12:48] I was telling them that,
he is really cooperative.
[12:52] He helps me with all the work
and he does all the work outside,
[12:57] he doesn’t do the work at home.
He does all the work outside.
[13:00] You shouldn’t be that cooperative.
[13:03] Hey son, what is there to worry about.
[13:07] I am the girl’s father,
I am not the arguing aunt of the girl
[13:10] that I will take out flaws in you
and end the proposal there.
[13:14] No, you know what it was.
[13:18] Breaking news, the proposal has been fixed.
We just need to fix the date, why do you worry?
[13:25] Congratulations. Congratulations.
[13:27] I will go get sweets, sir.
[13:29] He is feeling shy.
[13:35] I just don’t understand you Mahir.
You say anything to anyone’s face.
[13:39] You are really outspoken.
[13:41] But Rania, who is a sweet girl,
you cannot say to her that you love her?
[13:47] Rania is a smart girl.
[13:50] It is not that he will say I love you and
she will accept it considering it her good luck.
[13:55] She won’t accept this love so easily.
[13:57] So how will she accept it?
You people are really complicated.
[14:02] You don’t know Honey,
these two have fought a lot.
[14:07] and their diplomatic relations
have also stayed really bad.
[14:10] And Rania doesn’t have
a good opinion about our friend.
[14:15] But this mister didn’t think of it then that he will;
love the same girl in future. Now suffer.
[14:20] Yes, so I am suffering,
what else am I doing?
[14:23] Whatever was left,
Honey, your aunt has completed that.
[14:27] She has put claims on my property.
[14:30] How do I go to Rania’s father
to ask for her proposal?
[14:34] I am poor, I have nothing.
[14:36] Now do I go to Rania’s millionaire father with this face?
As a poor man? Hey, my life is ruined.
[14:42] Fine, then sit and cry, don’t do anything.
[14:45] Man, I cannot do anything in this issue.
At least you people help me out.
[14:49] Can you people not find
the solution for such a small problem?
[14:52] Mahir, it is such a small issue and you were saying that
you have made a room in Rania’s Mian Jee’s heart.
[14:57] Yes, so should I marry Mian Jee?
Look at you talk.
[15:00] Hey, I should make room in
the heart of the person I want to marry.
[15:03] Now this is something difficult.
[15:05] Hey, you stay quiet.
[15:07] The situation is already really tense and
you start your commentary in the middle.
[15:13] Salik, I am going home.
[15:16] And I will go meet Rania,
and I will talk to Rania for Mahir myself.
[15:22] Honey, I will come with you,
[15:24] the two of us will talk to Rania together
because now brother won’t be able to do anything.
[15:32] Hey, he is a good boy, I swear.
[15:34] Honestly, so decent, so sober, respecting.
I am surprised at the generation of today.
[15:43] and uncle, he was also really well trained.
He served the tea himself.
[15:47] Yes, for this I have given him extra numbers.
He got tea himself as well.
[15:53] Zaman, we don’t have to delay,
[15:57] I have thought that we fix a date for
the first week of next month for the wedding.
[16:03] Now it is your job to fix
what the exact date will be.
[16:07] No Mian Jee, how dare I?
[16:09] if you have fixed everything,
then also fix the date too.
[16:12] I just wanted to say that look around yourself too.
[16:17] We have a good sober, well settled boy around us.
I wanted to fix Rania’s proposal with her.
[16:28] Rania’s proposal?
[16:29] Are you talking about Dr. Wasiq?
Uncle, he is a good boy, I really like him.
[16:38] Then what do you say, Mian Jee?
[16:39] Yes, but I mean,
[16:42] he has a different temperament.
I mean he is serious type.
[16:49] This is his quality, Mian Jee,
you cannot call it his weakness.
[16:53] And when do we want to make
Rania’s husband do standup comedy?
[16:57] There is an age difference, but anyway,
there is no need to be hasty in this.
[17:02] Look, you are Rania’s father,
but I am the father’s father.
[17:07] I am well aware of her.
[17:09] Whatever decision I make will be better for her.
[17:13] You wait for this a little.
[17:16] Fine, Mian Jee as you see fit.
[17:48] Greetings mama. How are you?
Greetings.
[17:53] Mama, it has been long,
I have not seen Mahir. Where is he?
[17:57] Where is Mahir?
[17:59] Your wife dragged him out of the home,
that poor thing doesn’t want to come home.
[18:03] Mama, that is why I am saying,
[18:06] do you remember even that
day I had spoken to you
[18:09] that we should fix the proposal
between Mahir and Honey.
[18:12] Everything will be in Mahir’s control,
I am telling you.
[18:16] look I am his father,
I will not make a wrong decision.
[18:20] You just say yes, I would say.
[18:22] I am not the one who will say ‘I accept’,
‘I accept’, when he won’t agree, what do I do?
[18:27] Mama.
[18:29] Yes?
It was time for your tea, so I got it made.
[18:31] Look at that, my love, live long, live long.
[18:35] Child why did you get into this formality,
Seema and Rabail would have brought it. You are our guest.
[18:41] Sit my child.
You drink it and tell me how it is.
[18:43] I make really good tea. Will you have it?
Then it must be good.
[18:46] No. No, child.
[18:48] Right now I am sweet talking mama right now.
I will have sweet tea later.
[18:53] Great tea child. Thank you child.
[18:56] Right mama, she made good tea.
[18:58] She is a really good girl,
she is happy and jolly.
[19:02] I would say mama,
such girls are hard to find in today’s time.
[19:07] Mahir and Honey’s pair will look good together.
[19:10] You ask him once, it is possible
he doesn’t have an objection on this.
[19:15] What do you say?
[19:16] Should we ask about the proposal?
There is no issue in that.
[19:19] There is no issue. Yes. I will ask him.
[19:26] Enjoy your tea, mama.
[19:34] What are you people planning to do with me?
[19:36] Hey, you are good friends with Mahir
and just like it happens in the films,
[19:41] this friendship will also change into love.
[19:44] Aunty, please be quiet.
Do you think my life is a joke?
[19:49] Child, if you don’t find a husband
that is subdued by you,
[19:52] then life becomes a joke,
[19:54] and that too such a joke that
you always cry on instead of laughing.
[19:58] I don’t understand, aunty.
[20:00] You don’t like Mahir, nor his family, then why do you
want me to get married in the people you don’t like?
[20:06] Politics, child. You call this politics.
[20:10] Just like Dabeer is an obedient husband,
I feel Mahir too will turn out to be an obedient husband.
[20:16] And you don’t find this class of men in America.
[20:20] Just like I rule my husband,
I want that you too rule your husband the same way.
[20:26] Just let these desis come to America,
then you will see how they become our slave.
[20:32] Aunty.
[20:36] Oh, Mahir.
[20:46] Hello. Yes, Honey, go ahead.
[20:48] Mahir come home immediately.
[20:49] Why? what hell has broken loose?
[20:52] Will you only come when hell breaks loose?
[20:54] Honey, right now I am at Salik’s home,
[20:56] and I am going to do
something important with him.
[20:58] I cannot come right now.
[20:59] Okay tell me, where are you going?
I will come there.
[21:01] What is the thing?
What is the emergency, tell me at least.
[21:05] I will come and tell you, tell me,
where are you going?
[21:09] I am going to hell.
Will you come to meet me?
[21:11] You won’t tell me, right?
Fine. I will call Salik and ask him.
[21:21] Hi. Salik, where is Mahir going?
[21:27] By the way while shopping you look so innocent,
so cute…how many kurtis did you get till now?
[21:34] These are not kurtis, these are dresses.
[21:36] You deserve dresses.
You get them.
[21:40] They will look good on you.
[21:42] This one is so pretty.
[21:43] Oh wow, the color will look good.
Get two of these.
[21:45] My salary is fifty thousand.
Fifty thousand.
[21:48] Are you sure?
Yes.
[21:52] This is a little dark.
[21:54] But it will look good on you.
[21:56] the time for black will
never go out of fashion. Great.
[21:59] This one is also good.
[22:00] This is a pair, right?
[22:02] Fifty thousand?
[22:04] This place has almost fifty thousand varieties.
I think that one is more in. come on.
[22:11] What is the problem?
[22:12] You people had to shop,
you people got me along for no reason.
[22:16] Do you people see her?
Do you hear her talk?
[22:18] Are you not happy in my happiness?
[22:21] I used to think you would be
the most excited on my marriage.
[22:24] And look at your attitude.
[22:26] Okay, why are you getting upset?
I have a bad headache.
[22:30] Then why didn’t you tell me earlier?
[22:32] I will get you tea from here, this will fix your headache
and till then your shopping will be done as well.
[22:36] I don’t want to have tea.
Come on, please.
[22:40] Hey, he is insisting so much, then go ahead.
[22:42] You will have a headache for no reason
and you will stand here with that face.
[22:45] Have tea, you will go in the open air,
[22:48] we too will spend some time together,
we will shop. You too shop.
[22:52] Come on, please.
[22:54] Okay, then please do me
a favour and come soon.
[22:57] We will come really soon.
You take care of Rania.
[23:00] Yes, sure, you please continue.
[23:03] I think we should go to the Friday market,
[23:07] because things are coming there from the entire
world and maybe you will like the variety?
[23:14] Shall we go?
[23:16] It is right here. Come on.
[23:24] Man, this pair of jeans looks so good.
[23:26] Salik, if you want to shop, then go ahead,
I have to talk to Mahir about something important.
[23:30] What are you saying Honey?
[23:31] If I wanted to shop alone,
why would I have brought him along?
[23:34] Consider the seriousness of the situation.
It will take ten minutes.
[23:36] Just ten minutes.
I will really bring Mahir back.
[23:39] Hey…
Hey, I will get bored here alone.
[23:43] Hey Honey, where are you taking me?
[23:45] I am telling you. you didn’t even
listen to me properly on the phone.
[23:48] I don’t know what you want
to talk about? At least tell me.
[23:50] We will sit and talk.
[23:57] Come from here, I cannot sit here.
Why? Why? Why? Why?
[24:02] What happened?
[24:05] Those two live in the same home,
can they not leave together for some work?
[24:08] They cannot.
[24:10] Honey this is not America,
this is Pakistan and all this doesn’t happen here.
[24:38] Hi.
[24:45] Hi. How are you people?
[24:48] You are together,
so you must be happy and satisfied,
[24:51] or else why is anyone with someone.
[24:54] You are right,
[24:56] no one goes around
with anyone without a reason.
[25:03] Can we join you people?
[25:07] Hey, when will you enjoy our company?
[25:11] Look at Mr. Mahir’s face,
he has got a bad temper just hearing this.
[25:15] You people sit, have a seat,
enjoy each other’s company.
[25:20] We were about to go.
we had to shop a little.
[25:22] Shall we go Dr. Wasiq?
[25:24] The tea?
[25:26] I will get that for you from a good place.
From a tea stall. We will go.
[25:32] Bye.
[25:38] Mahir, you are stupid.
We got such a good chance, but you…
[25:41] What chance? You…
You are useless.
[25:46] Shall we sit now?
[25:49] Mahir.
[25:52] Rania, we had to have tea.
[25:55] I didn’t want to have it,
it was your advice.
[25:57] But what happened suddenly?
[26:00] I had told you earlier my head hurts,
I want to go back home.
[26:03] Fine. I agree, but listen to me.
[26:06] I told you I don’t want to hear anything,
I want to go back home right now.
[26:10] Rania, how will you go alone?
[26:12] For your information,
I came to your city from my village, alone.
[26:15] So can I not go home alone?
[26:17] Okay fine, I will drop you. You…
[26:19] There is no need for that.
Will you live with me all your life? No, right?
[26:22] After all, I am used to doing my own work,
I can go, you check on Beno.
[26:30] Hey doctor, how are you?
[26:35] Greetings.
[26:37] Who else will I meet here?
[26:39] I mean, you are here, I met Mahir
and whoever she was on the top floor.
[26:44] Yes. Yes. I have come with Mahir and Honey.
[26:48] Then you should have stayed with them,
you have worried people.
[26:52] What do you mean?
No, nothing. That…
[26:58] You were buying something, right?
[27:06] Hey Honey,
leave me I don’t want to come.
[27:07] I don’t know what issue this Salik has,
why he dropped me here and left?
[27:10] Salik dropped you here
so that you listen to me calmly. But you…
[27:14] I don’t want to go…
[27:15] Oh my son is here.
I am so happy prince.
[27:20] Honey, I knew you will bring him here.
[27:23] You naughty boy,
I knew you would never say no to Honey.
[27:27] Oh Honey, you two look
so good standing together.
[27:31] Honey, you?
[27:33] You conspired with your mother
and got me here…
[27:36] Honey, I didn’t expect this from you
and you also involved Salik with you.
[27:39] There is nothing like that, Mahir, trust me.
[27:41] Stop it, man. I will not stay here
even for a moment. I am going.
[27:44] No. No. No.
Leave me.
[27:45] Where are you going? Please come,
it is your own home, you will live here now.
[27:49] Leave me.
[27:50] Mahir, listen to me, your mother in law is right,
I mean your future mother in law.
[27:54] Hey look you are mama’s beloved,
you are the light of this home.
[27:57] Now your wedding is getting fixed,
at least help with the arrangements.
[28:01] Wedding is getting fixed.
Why are you joking with me?
[28:04] I am not joking, you know just between us,
you two don’t look good together.
[28:08] Mahir, no.
[28:11] Mahir. Mahir.
[28:14] Okay good, he came inside.
[28:21] Brother Anwaar has fixed the engagement
date for Asma and Ayaz’s engagement.
[28:26] So I was thinking…
[28:27] You are thinking right mama,
lets fix Mahir and Honey’s proposal too.
[28:32] Absolutely right.
[28:34] Grandma, what is going on behind
my back in this home?
[28:39] What conspiracy is being created against me?
[28:41] What conspiracy son?
What are you saying?
[28:44] Okay,
[28:46] the boy has been informed and
this news has fallen on the child as lightening.
[28:51] Now we will see on who all does
this boy falls on as lightening.
[28:56] Everyone hear one thing clearly,
no one can force me.
[29:00] Hey son, what are you saying?
We won’t make a wrong decision for you.
[29:05] After all, I am your father, man.
[29:06] I know but before being my father,
you are her husband too.
[29:12] What are you saying?
[29:14] Hey, you are good friends with Honey,
no we said it, you are getting angry.
[29:19] So dad, you are making me angry.
[29:22] I am telling you,
I will not come in under anyone’s pressure.
[29:25] It is a clear no from me for this proposal.
[29:28] Hey, hey, look son, don’t be emotional.
Calm down. Calm down.
[29:32] Go inside the room,
lie down, have cold water.
[29:36] Think with a cool mind.
[29:37] The decision we are making is
right in your favour, it is not wrong.
[29:43] Tell him Honey how good you are,
what good of a child are you?
[29:47] I will tell him, uncle. I think Mahir is feeling shy,
give him some time, don’t get angry.
[29:52] What are you saying?
[29:54] By the way Honey, on such occasions,
the future bride gets shy in our home.
[30:00] They must feel shy, but the thing is,
I don’t know how to feel shy.
[30:03] The child is right,
[30:05] the country she has come from there,
there is no shame.
[30:10] I request all of you to give Mahir some time.
[30:13] Mahir will not disappoint you at all.
[30:16] Mahir, go to the lawn,
take deep breaths, relax,
[30:18] you are lucky that I came in your life,
your fate has been awakened.
[30:21] What fate? What?
Go. Go.
[30:23] I don’t know what she is talking about.
[30:29] Now we will not talk about this topic again.
[30:32] Honey, what are you saying?
I don’t understand.
[30:35] Nothing against Mahir’s will, will happen.
[30:39] This means that this marriage will not take place.
[30:43] Huh?
[30:50] To hell with this drama on TV,
the real drama is taking place in this home.
[30:55] You don’t care.
