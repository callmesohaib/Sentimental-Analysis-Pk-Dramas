[00:39] Yes,
[00:41] what are you thinking about?
Huh? My smart child.
[00:48] Nothing, Mian Jee, just like that.
[00:53] Child,
[00:54] when you came in this world,
[00:57] then the first person
who picked you in his arms was me.
[01:01] I can read your face.
[01:03] But you are really smart,
several times I don’t find out.
[01:06] Tell me, share it with Mian Jee,
your burden will be reduced.
[01:11] I told you Mian Jee,
there is nothing like that.
[01:14] Then why are you sitting sad like this?
[01:17] You are worried for no reason.
Tell me, did you need something?
[01:23] Yes, I wanted something.
Sit here. Sit down.
[01:29] I wanted to ask you a question,
are you ready to answer?
[01:33] Yes, I am ready, ask me.
[01:39] I want to ask what do you
think about the engagement?
[01:44] Now don’t give me stories,
answer straight forward.
[01:48] If someone else is getting engaged,
it is a good thought,
[01:53] and if you are talking about my engagement,
then it is a clear no.
[01:57] Mian Jee, as per my personal
opinion both things must happen.
[02:02] First engagement, then marriage.
[02:04] Like this people will get
a chance to attend two functions.
[02:07] And it will be a lot of fun.
[02:08] I want to talk about a serious topic,
and you are….
[02:13] Go come on, make tea.
[02:16] Make tea and also fry some fritters.
[02:18] Mian Jee, this will take a lot of time.
[02:21] Yes, so I also need a lot of time to talk.
[02:23] Come on, go.
[02:29] Ye child, then tell me,
[02:31] what do you want to do in your future life?
[02:35] You know my plan from the start, Mian Jee,
I have to become the prime minister.
[02:40] In fact, I am thinking it is time
to enter professional politics too.
[02:44] Yes, child.
[02:45] The lessons for professional politics
can also start from home.
[02:50] For example,
[02:52] the politics of mother and daughter in law.
[02:55] the politics of daughter and sisters in law,
the politics of husband and wife.
[02:59] If a person goes from home prepared like this,
[03:03] then they can be really successful in the world.
[03:05] Yes. everything is possible.
You know this boy, Wasiq, he is good.
[03:15] Mian Jee, I came to ask
what pakoras will you have?
[03:20] Eggplant or spinach?
[03:22] Hey, make it out of sand, do anything.
[03:25] I am talking on a serious topic here.
[03:28] Come on, go.
[03:29] Okay, then I will make it out of potatoes,
even Rania likes them.
[03:34] No need to bother for me.
I don’t want to eat them.
[03:36] The same problem all the time.
[03:38] What happened to her, Mian Jee?
[03:40] Can you not see, she doesn’t like pakoras.
[03:42] Problems, trouble.
[03:43] Anyway, Mahir is coming in the evening,
[03:47] tell Asiya to get food made under her supervision.
[03:51] Why is this Mahir coming?
[03:53] No need to serve him.
[03:55] His American returned mother is there,
she will take care of him.
[03:59] She will cook for him.
[04:00] Now she has even invited her help,
her adopted daughter.
[04:03] Cunning woman.
[04:05] Mahir wanted such a girl. He deserves this.
[04:09] Cunning. Witch.
[04:13] Child, isn’t this a bit much?
Do you have a personal problem with her?
[04:17] You will see Mian Jee,
[04:19] this mother and daughter will
make Mahir move to their orders.
[04:22] Oh my.
[04:30] Did you fry the pakoras?
[04:32] I hadn’t started,
I just came to ask you right now.
[04:37] Hey Honey, what do you feel
I will think something wrong for you?
[04:41] Right now I have not thought about it,
[04:43] but I know this that
you didn’t take this decision in my love.
[04:46] You did it for your own benefit.
[04:47] You need this home and you also know
that you can never get it by force.
[04:52] Hey, damn you Honey.
This means you don’t trust me.
[04:57] Madam Sweetie.
Madam Sweetie. Madam Sweetie.
[04:59] One minute, first hear me out.
[05:03] If you don’t look good,
you should say good things.
[05:06] This Honey has burned my heart.
[05:09] Sweetie, I came to tell you
that Mahir out of all the people…
[05:12] Oh, thank God. Thank God.
I was sure this would happen.
[05:18] I knew Mahir is a clever boy,
he will get a little upset, but he will agree after that.
[05:24] Hey, this is the sad part, he didn’t understand
and he has said no in front of everyone.
[05:31] Damn it, idiot.
[05:34] Now he will see the bad consequences
of this with his own eyes.
[05:38] I am going to the lawyer,
will you come with me or not?
[05:41] We will now decide about the property in the court.
[05:44] Hey Sweetie, calm down.
[05:47] Look, we can sit and calmly find a solution for this.
You have become stubborn like the politicians.
[05:54] Return all the dollars you used to send
these people from there, I will cool down.
[06:00] What are you saying, Sweetie?
[06:02] The dollars I used to earn there by working hard,
I have sent those to my family.
[06:07] Does someone take money for helping out their wife?
[06:09] Only a low life like you do this.
[06:12] Now you will see, I will make the life of
every single family member of yours hell.
[06:18] Aunt Sweetie, you get hyper really quickly.
[06:21] You don’t need to make anyone’s life hell.
[06:24] What you say will happen,
and I will handle everything.
[06:27] You just don’t need to get angry.
[06:28] If you were worthy of this,
then he wouldn’t have publicly said no like this.
[06:32] Only time will tell what I am worth.
[06:34] Right now, you won’t go to a lawyer, okay?
[06:41] Okay.
[06:42] I will wait for a few days,
[06:44] but if nothing happens during this time,
then I am going to the lawyer.
[06:47] Okay. Okay. I don’t need a lot of time.
[06:52] Relax.
[06:57] The situation doesn’t change
if you close your eyes like a pigeon.
[07:00] Today we have come to either fix
or finish this story.
[07:02] So be brave and come on.
[07:04] Oh wow.
[07:06] Greetings Mian jee.
[07:07] Hey, great to see you all.
[07:11] Where are you young people coming from today?
[07:13] Huh? Mahir, you have forgotten your
Mian Jee, yes? You don’t even meet me.
[07:19] Mian Jee, how is this possible?
[07:20] Hey it is possible,
you don’t come, I keep on waiting.
[07:24] If I tell you honestly Mian Jee,
you are great people.
[07:29] What if you think that
I come here often for a reason.
[07:33] Son, a great person is one who has humanity,
I consider him to be great.
[07:37] You are a good man.
[07:39] You should meet me. Okay, enjoy yourself.
I will go pray. Come on.
[07:47] Come, you people, have a seat.
I will send tea.
[07:50] Rania, we didn’t come here to have tea.
We came to meet you. You come and sit with us.
[07:55] Whether you drink it or not,
but we have guests over,
[07:58] it is my responsibility to serve them.
[08:01] I will send tea.
I will come with you.
[08:04] Okay.
[08:05] You people sit.
[08:17] I don’t know where these two are.
[08:20] How long will they make us wait?
[08:21] Hey Rabail must be making
Rania understand, it will take time.
[08:25] And Mahir hear me out clearly,
today you won’t stay stubborn.
[08:29] When Rabail will convince Rania,
then you too come in front and then you too…
[08:32] what do they say?
[08:37] Express your love. Express it. Okay?
[08:40] Let us also go. Let’s go. come on. Come.
[08:47] You give these two teas
and send them on their way.
[08:50] You can stay with me,
but send away Mahir and his friend.
[08:56] Hmmm…I fell you are jealous.
[09:01] Why would I be jealous of useless people?
[09:06] That is true as well.
[09:08] You know, brother has said no to marrying Honey.
[09:16] Really?
[09:18] Okay as he wishes, why would I care?
[09:23] By the way, they look good together.
[09:30] Brother loves you.
[09:33] Who said this to you?
[09:39] He told me himself and
Salik too was witness to this.
[09:45] Oh, okay.
[09:51] Rania, care for this love.
If he expresses it, don’t reject it, please.
[10:00] You are really naïve Rabail,
[10:02] you know nothing.
[10:04] Yes, I am naïve, but not stupid like you.
[10:08] Rania, a man wants to marry you,
what can be a bigger proof of someone’s love than this?
[10:16] How can a selfish,
[10:18] arrogant and cruel man like him understand love?
[10:27] I don’t think he even knows what love is.
[10:30] Maybe he just traps girls in his love and laughs at them.
[10:34] He bets.
[10:37] Then when he wins the bet, he celebrates his victory.
[10:45] A girl like me,
[10:47] for whom her self-respect and name is everything,
[10:51] I cannot be trapped in his love.
[11:01] What I am saying, this is the truth.
[11:46] Good.
[11:47] Very good.
[11:49] This should happen with a man like you.
[11:52] You were really proud of yourself.
[11:54] See.
[11:55] See, how that girl made you bow down?
[11:58] Is the bet you made?
[12:00] You wanted to make fun of Rania?
[12:02] You know, I used to consider Rania wrong
and you my friend. I am so stupid.
[12:11] Rania has shown you the mirror brother.
[12:13] In future don’t even try to make fun of a girl.
[12:17] Oh hey, easy. Relax.
[12:19] I was not making a joke out of her.
I really love her.
[12:25] Yes, but this is also true
that you had bet with me.
[12:27] Oh man. Yes I did.
[12:30] I did bet. But that was my stupidity.
[12:32] I made a mistake that I…
[12:36] I really love her, man.
[12:39] I don’t want to lose her.
[12:44] Are you speaking the truth?
This is the truth.
[12:47] I agree betting was my fault
[12:50] and I am also embarrassed on that fault.
[12:53] And he.
[12:54] You know everything, man,
still you are standing against me with them.
[12:58] Hey, I made a mistake
[13:01] but you also see how much
I have served her grandfather.
[13:05] What for? To make room in his heart.
[13:09] I broke all records of decency in front of her father.
[13:12] Seeing her with Dr. Wasiq, I burned my heart,
I ate fire, I did it all, I sacrificed it, for whom? For Rania.
[13:21] Look girls, he is right.
[13:24] He really loves this girl.
[13:27] But Rania doesn’t trust you at all.
[13:32] I know,
[13:34] she is mad.
[13:36] She has a lot of ego.
[13:41] You people will have to help me.
[13:45] How can we help you?
[13:46] Mahir you talk a lot otherwise
[13:49] and today a naïve girl is not able to believe your love.
[13:52] Show the magic of your sweet tongue.
[13:57] Rania has always been misled about me, man.
[14:03] No matter what I do,
[14:05] she will never believe me.
[14:07] But you people,
[14:09] she will listen to you people.
[14:11] You people can help me.
[14:14] What?
[14:16] Why are you staring at each
other with flat expressions?
[14:19] Help me out.
[14:21] Hey, what sort of friends are you people?
[14:23] Can you not see this sadness,
this sorrow, this sad face of mine?
[14:29] See. See. See. See.
[14:37] Laughing faces don’t mean
that they don’t get hurt,
[14:43] in fact, it means that
they know how to deal with their pains...
[14:51] That’s it man, stop being so cringey,
we heard you. Yes, it is done.
[14:56] Come. so, I was saying that somehow...
You be quiet.
[15:09] Your tea.
[15:10] Yes, thank you.
[15:12] Hey this Mahir and the girls they left suddenly,
did you not invite them for food?
[15:21] Leave it, Mian Jee.
[15:22] These are busy people of the city,
they don’t have so much time.
[15:25] What is the matter?
Did you have a fight between you and Mahir?
[15:29] Huh?
[15:29] No. No Mian Jee, what sort of fight?
[15:32] Okay.
[15:34] He is going to get married,
did you congratulate him?
[15:39] No. No Rabail told me,
Mahir has said no to the proposal.
[15:44] This had to happen,
[15:46] how could Mahir get in a relation with
aunt Sweetie’s adopted daughter?
[15:49] He really dislikes aunt Sweetie.
[15:52] He said no?
[15:54] He did something stupid, he is a good girl.
[15:57] Okay, I will make him understand.
[15:59] What? You will make him understand?
[16:03] Mian Jee for my sake, you won’t do this.
[16:06] Hah, why?
[16:09] You just won’t do it.
In fact, you promise me that you won’t do it.
[16:15] In the village, us grandfather and granddaughter would
solve everyone’s issues, what is the matter here?
[16:21] The people of the city are different.
We should get into the fights of others.
[16:26] Okay.
[16:28] If we shouldn’t then we won’t.
[16:34] Hey Rafiq Ahmed,
[16:36] Khaver and Mona’s proposal got fixed,
we fixed the date.
[16:41] So you have two weeks,
[16:45] so you can tighten his nuts.
[16:48] He is out of his mind.
[16:55] Mama, please understand my position.
[16:58] Give me a little respect like a son in law.
[17:01] Be quiet Khaver, sister is absolutely right.
[17:05] Mama, why don’t we make things lively?
Let’s have a musical evening or something.
[17:10] It will be fun. Right? after all,
I have got so many clothes stitched, when will I show off?
[17:15] Your wife is right, you know.
Yes, she is right.
[17:18] Is this even something to say?
[17:20] I know you.
[17:22] You do one thing call the neighbours,
then ask for a drum, then also call Rania to come.
[17:29] It will be fun so that everyone knows
that there is a wedding in this home.
[17:35] Mahir, son, why do you have a long face,
did you lose something?
[17:40] My heart is lost, grandma.
[17:42] You lost your heart?
What?
[17:45] I have lost the locket with a heart.
I was talking about it.
[17:50] Oh, don’t take it to your heart.
No problem. Why worry about the locket?
[17:54] Your friend had a shop,
he has several lockets.
[17:59] Mahir, you don’t worry,
we will all find it together.
[18:01] You will find your heart locket soon.
[18:04] thank you, Honey.
Yes, yes, son. Yes.
[18:06] I will order it from Dubai for you.
[18:10] Come on son, don’t have this
long face for a small locket.
[18:13] God will give you a lot more.
[18:15] Seema, call Rania,
ask her to come, so that we can enjoy.
[18:20] I don’t enjoy it when she is not here, I swear.
Okay, mama.
[18:29] Child, what is this drama?
This girl keeps on crying.
[18:34] Qalandar.
[18:35] Yes I don’t know our prayers don’t get answered.
[18:38] Hah.
[18:40] Sister in law.
[18:42] Sister in law.
[18:43] Yes. Yes.
[18:44] You know, mama called.
[18:47] She said that they are coming to fix Mona’s date.
[18:49] They have invited us all.
[18:51] Wow.
[18:52] It will be so much fun,
we will also play the drum.
[18:54] Yes.
[18:55] This is true, we will have fun.
[18:56] Hey Rania, why are you always in
a corner like a sick chicken?
[19:00] Decide what you want to wear tomorrow.
[19:03] Uncle, I would say that along with Mona,
we should also send off our Bebo.
[19:07] After all, her in-laws are really restless.
[19:11] Yes, the sooner a person fulfils their responsibility
towards their daughters, the better.
[19:16] What else? Fine.
[19:18] Mian Jee.
Yes?
[19:21] I want to talk to you and
Asiya about Rania’s proposal.
[19:25] Go ahead.
[19:26] Wasiq is a good boy.
[19:29] He will keep Rania really happy.
[19:32] I think there can be no better
proposal for our Rania than this.
[19:36] Oh, I swear, I really like Wasiq.
[19:40] The best thing is that he is a real doctor.
[19:43] At our village, even the fake doctors have
a lot of respect, Bebo. He is a real doctor.
[19:47] Hey, it is really good that he is a doctor but
this wedding is not a game of dolls.
[19:54] A person fixes a wedding after thinking hard.
[19:56] That boy is not leaving the home
and going, he is here.
[19:59] Hey, no, Mian jee, he is an obedient boy,
why would he do this?
[20:03] Then calm down,
whatever has to happen will happen.
[20:06] Okay sister in law, be quick.
We have to prepare too.
[20:08] Mama must be waiting, we will get late.
[20:11] Hey, Bebo, the function is not today,
it is tomorrow.
[20:14] Someone is really restless to go to sister’s home.
[20:18] Come on, let’s go to the kitchen.
[20:21] Will you come with us? Huh?
[20:25] No, Mian Jee, what will I do there?
You people go ahead.
[20:29] Yes, you are a serious man.
[20:32] When do you sit with jolly people?
[20:35] No, Mian Jee, I don’t mean that.
[20:38] Hey, this drama is the same too,
the girl is crying again.
[20:44] All this is the doctor’s conspiracy
[20:47] or else where did papa
think of my marriage suddenly?
[20:52] I will not leave this doctor.
[20:54] I will make sure he forgets about marriage.
[21:01] Damn him.
[21:06] What are you talking to yourself about?
[21:09] Leave me alone right now, Bebo.
I am really angry.
[21:15] That is what I came to find out
that what is my Rania angry about.
[21:21] Okay, so I tell you this myself too?
[21:25] Did you not hear what your brother said?
I am sure mama must be agreeing to him.
[21:32] So what is bad about the doctor?
[21:34] I mean, Rania,
[21:38] parents look for the best of
the best for their children.
[21:43] And when such a good proposal is
present at home, then you do think.
[21:48] See.
[21:49] See, you too agree with your brother.
All of you have made me alone.
[21:56] You and me are separate, that is not possible.
[22:01] Even if you don’t tell me
what is in your heart or not, I know it all.
[22:07] Yes, but maybe you don’t know
what is in your heart,
[22:12] or maybe you are acting like
you are unaware on purpose.
[22:38] You are back.
[22:39] Yes, I am back.
[22:43] I feel you were waiting for me restlessly.
[22:47] Yes. I was waiting for you really restlessly.
[22:50] Tell me something, for so many years,
you were single, there was no issue then.
[22:54] What is the problem now that
you immediately want to get married?
[22:58] Problem?
Yes.
[23:02] It feels like you don’t like me getting married.
[23:05] There is something like that.
[23:07] Tell me father,
that you don’t want to get married right now.
[23:10] Or else you will see the worst in me.
[23:12] You are weird, my life has become hell.
[23:22] Problem?
[23:26] Okay uncle, you made the tea get cold.
NI cooled it down with difficulty.
[23:32] Uncle, you make Rania understand.
What?
[23:36] She was scolding the doctor and the poor,
[23:38] innocent doctor is listening to her
with his head bowed down.
[23:42] She is such a small girl
and she has raised hell.
[23:45] Tell her not to become everyone’s aunt.
[23:48] hey, what was she saying?
[23:49] I didn’t hear it clearly,
[23:52] but she was saying something like
I have spent my entire life single,
[23:55] why do you want to get married now?
[23:57] These things this girl says,
we will miss out on such a good proposal.
[24:01] I am saying uncle before anything goes wrong,
I would say fix the proposal.
[24:06] What are you thinking? I am right.
[24:09] Hey, the thing is that everyone is saying
that the boy is really good.
[24:13] That is true.
[24:16] Then does the girl have any will or not?
[24:20] Does anyone from amongst
us has to get married or her?
[24:22] When I gave my daughter
the right to marry by her will,
[24:26] then what do you think
I won’t give this right to my granddaughter.
[24:30] She will do what she wills.
[24:32] So she wants to become the prime minister,
she will do that.
[24:36] Should be reject such a good proposal
for the sake of her mad wishes?
[24:39] Those who dare to dream are able to fulfill them.
[24:41] You don’t worry about Rania so much,
think about Asma.
[24:45] Will we get gas at Sehri time or not.
The city is worried.
[24:48] You are worried about Rania.
[24:50] We will have a gas loadshedding,
should I heat your tea.
[24:52] No, I just told you that
I have cooled it down with difficulty.
[24:55] Let it be. I will have it.
[25:04] Asma, I am Ayaz.
[25:09] When this little sunlight falls on your face,
[25:14] what if you get a sunburn.
[25:16] You are so fair.
[25:18] Oh yes, this?
[25:20] I got this flower for you.
[25:27] Would you like to marry me, Asma?
[25:32] Oh, I will bow down and say it.
[25:34] Asma…oh what if brother sees me.
[25:39] What if brother sees me. One minute.
[25:41] Asma, how are you? Brother, how are you?
[25:46] Sister.
[25:49] What madness is this?
Sister I was practicing for tomorrow.
[25:55] Why for tomorrow?
[25:56] Mona and their event,
I was practicing to give Asma a flower there.
[26:01] Flower?
Yes.
[26:02] Huh? Bloody fool.
Did you iron the clothes?
[26:06] I have ironed three dresses sister.
Three. I am thinking I will wear white.
[26:10] I am not talking about your dress,
I am asking about my dress.
[26:12] Sister, I don’t understand if I should iron
your Sari or this trouser or…
[26:18] Yes, yes, how will you understand?
You are madly in love.
[26:22] Hey sister what are you saying?
what are you saying?
[26:26] Do you want that
I turn your age and die single?
[26:27] You want this? Do you want this?
[26:29] No, right? I do all your work.
[26:32] I do every type of work.
I iron your clothes.
[26:35] I am going around this home like a gardener,
I go around like a chef.
[26:40] I am your maid, she doesn’t come.
[26:42] I am going around the home, getting it cleaned.
At times I am cleaning the pipes, right?
[26:45] Yes, and what about the great food
I cook with a lot of effort?
[26:49] God forgive me.
[26:50] Not even the animals are eating
that potatoes with eggplant.
[26:53] I threw it outside the home,
even the animals looked away, It was so tasteless.
[26:56] That’s it. That’s it That’s it.
You are insulting my potatoes with eggplant again?
[26:59] Not anymore.
[27:00] Don’t insult my food, I am telling you.
[27:02] Sister, it is an insult.
[27:04] If you are considering it food,
it is an insult. It is an insult.
[27:08] Fine, you eat now.
[27:10] You eat now.
[27:12] I will keep you hungry.
I will keep you hungry. Yes. Yes.
[27:17] Sister is turning into Hitler
I will practice again.
[27:24] Hello Asma, how are you?
Hey brother, how are you? All well?
[27:27] Hey brother. Brother, what is that?
[27:35] If I won’t go,
then wont her functions happen?
[27:38] If they want to fix Khaver and Mona’s date,
then they should do it without me.
[27:41] I don’t want to come.
[27:42] Put up a fake smile to convince the world.
When is being two faced something new for you?
[27:48] You, be quiet man.
[27:50] You are just a friend in name.
[27:52] You cannot do something small
that your brother is in pain,
[27:54] go and make Rania understand,
that whatever happened was a joke.
[27:58] A mischief. I really love her.
[28:01] No, man, no. she is stubborn number.
[28:04] Even if I stand on my head and
make her believe, she still won’t accept it.
[28:08] I don’t know what was that damned moment
when I listened to you and spoke nonsense?
[28:14] You often speak such nonsense about yourself.
Now today you are blaming me.
[28:19] What did you say? I told you.
[28:22] Yes, you are right about this.
[28:25] I feel Rania loves Mahir secretly.
[28:30] Yes, I feel the same way.
[28:33] She loves you but…
[28:35] That’s what I am saying,
that it is not possible that someone smart,
[28:40] dashing and handsome boy is around
and the girl doesn’t dream about me.
[28:44] See. Did you people see?
[28:46] This is him being mistaken.
[28:48] You can write it down,
you will die one day, you won’t get Rania.
[28:52] and hearing you talk, I want to...
[28:55] Hey, enough. Enough. Enough.
Yes, Rabail what were you saying, that Rania…
[28:58] I was saying that she loves you,
she is just scared to say it.
[29:02] She doesn’t like defeat.
[29:05] And she is afraid that
when she expresses her love,
what will be your reaction?
[29:09] That’s it I have decided,
Rania will have to confess her love.
[29:14] Hey, Honey don’t mess it up. Please.
[29:17] Doctor Wasiq is ready to attack like an eagle.
If we make any mistake, and he will…be careful, please.
[29:28] Hey, nothing will go wrong.
I will fit the formula this time.
[29:31] What do we have to do?
[29:33] I will tell you when it is time.
Hey Honey.
[29:35] Honey, by sharing the plan,
even we can put our input in it.
[29:39] Tell us at least what is the plan.
[29:41] I will tell you, have patience.
Hey, at least give a hint.
[29:44] Uh-huh.
Hey Honey, the plan…
[29:48] You have a cruel cousin.
[29:50] She says she is helping me,
but I don’t feel her help.
[29:54] I don’t what plan is in her head,
she didn’t tell me anything.
[29:57] My blood pressure is rising.
[29:59] I don’t think you are fine.
[30:01] We will do one thing,
we will go to Dr. Wasiq, we will get you treated.
[30:06] Even if I am dying
I still won’t go to that doctor Wasiq.
[30:11] Yes, yes, don’t go to Dr. Wasiq,
what if he gives you a poison injection.
[30:16] Yes.
[30:18] You two are totally thankless.
[30:22] I have helped so much,
[30:25] but when brother is in trouble…go ahead.
[30:27] What help?
Joke around. Really?
[30:30] Do you remind you what else?
[30:32] Don’t be disheartened, we will do something.
[30:45] Aunty what is all this?
[30:47] Today, I will tell everyone
how rich of a woman I am.
[30:52] What is the point aunt?
No one will get Impressed.
[30:54] Oh, I just remembered,
I don’t have to talk to you.
[30:58] What sort of a girl are you?
You couldn’t trap a boy like Mahir.
[31:02] If you had given importance to what I had said,
then we wouldn’t have had to see this day today.
[31:07] What happened?
So what I faced a loss of millions, so what?
[31:09] Aunt Sweetie, you be happy.
[31:12] I have decided to trap Mahir.
[31:14] Very soon, we will also get engaged.
You just don’t create a scene.
[31:19] Hey Honey, are you joking?
[31:21] No, no, I am speaking the truth, I promise.
[31:24] Oh, I will wear double
the Jewellery in this happiness.
[31:29] No, no, don’t wear anymore.
[31:31] If grandma sees you in this condition,
[31:33] she will give you a funny title
and you will just sit and cry.
[31:38] Now mama has to cry all her life
[31:41] when I fly away with her son,
along with her grandson to America.
[31:46] Oh Honey, you have made me happy.
[31:55] Rania, be quick, everyone must be waiting.
It has been so long.
[31:59] It is done.
[32:02] Bebo.
Yes?
[32:03] Tell me something.
[32:06] Can a narcissist,
[32:09] arrogant and flirty person love someone truly?
[32:14] You know Rania,
these matters of the heart are really strange.
[32:18] You don’t know when someone
comes close to your heart.
[32:21] Now you look at me.
[32:24] Yes, but how will we find out
if a person is really serious or is it a bet…
[32:29] I mean how will we find out
that the love is real.
[32:35] I don’t know,
I never got involved with such a person.
[32:38] And now you leave all this.
[32:40] We will come home comfortably at night
and find a solution for this problem.
[32:43] You get ready quickly.
Yes..
[32:48] You know Mahir has clearly said no to
marring that American return Honey.
[32:57] I feel Mahir loves someone else.
[33:03] I don’t know if he did it in someone’s love
or if aunt Sweetie’s hatred made him do this.
[33:09] Hmmm.
[33:12] This is such a problem, man,
you cannot find out the truth.
[33:17] What is the deal?
You are thinking a lot about Mahir today.
[33:23] Yes,
[33:24] so he is our relative.
[33:26] No matter how she is, we have a relation,
we can think about him.
[33:31] We even have a relation with Dr. Wasiq
[33:33] and sister in law was telling me you have said no to
that poor thing, that there is no need to get married.
[33:39] This is my personal matter.
[33:55] Oh, Rania, why am I all rosy?
Did I ask you to do this?
[34:00] Hey, when is it too much?
You ruined my entire makeup.
[34:03] You look fresh.
[34:06] Uncle likes rosy.
Pink is his favourite colour.
[34:10] Really?
Yes.
[34:35] Hey Asiya,
[34:37] how did you think of this worthless man today?
[34:40] where are you?
[34:41] You questioned me just like a wife.
[34:44] I am your wife,
[34:46] do you have any doubt?
[34:48] Not just a wife,
[34:50] a faithful wife.
[34:52] It is not easy to sit waiting for an unfaithful man.
[34:58] Leave it.
[35:01] I had buried this discussion in
a corner of my home in the village.
[35:06] You too don’t say these things.
[35:08] As you order, madam.
Now will you tell me, why did you call?
[35:12] Do you remember,
papa had told you to come to aunt’s home.
[35:16] You come there, uncle will be really happy.
[35:20] Fine, I will reach as soon
as I get done with work.
[35:24] Any other order?
[35:26] What order will I give,
you do what you want.
[35:30] We will meet in the evening.
Take care of yourself.
[35:35] Goodbye.
[35:36] Goodbye.
[37:14] Who knows Mahir might really love me.
[37:31] It is also possible.
[37:34] After all, what do I lack?
[37:38] I am good, educated and
also the future prime minister.
[37:45] I will try to find out,
[37:48] at least, I will be on one side.
