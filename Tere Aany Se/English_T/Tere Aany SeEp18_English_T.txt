[00:18] And tell me, which ring should I give?
[00:21] Mother, the one I gave you.
[00:23] So that's why you got me the ring.
[00:51] Oh I die, mother, look who's here.
[00:55] Rafique Ahmed, you haven't left yet?
[01:03] Listen, if you're here to get your son
engaged to our Rabail again
[01:08] then that isn't possible.
[01:10] If you're here as Saman's father-in-law
to join in our celebration then welcome.
[01:14] Welcome, come on, come on.
[01:17] Rania we have guests over,
make way for them.
[01:20] Welcome, welcome,
come on in.
[01:22] Uncle, with a big heart,
congratulate grandmother.
[01:27] See, her granddaughter got engaged
even after your rejection.
[01:31] And look how they got such a nice guy,
in a few minutes.
[01:40] Rafique Ahmed, come here
and sit with us.
[01:46] Come on, spit the anger.
[01:51] Brother Khawar,
have a seat.
[01:54] Come on, come on.
[01:57] Proud of you.
[01:58] Sister Anjum?
Why did you come so late?
[02:03] Oh so this is what it is?
[02:04] That's what you were hiding from me?
That's him.
[02:08] Come let me introduce you
to the bride and groom.
[02:13] Here we have our sister Anjum.
[02:16] Here's our brother groom,
and she's our bride.
[02:19] You got a nice catch.
[02:21] Okay, now we will dance.
[02:24] Get up, get up, get up.
Get up brother.
[02:27] Get up.
[02:28] Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
[02:49] My sister's marriage?
[02:50] That too with that monkey Farhad?
Never.
[02:53] Rabail won't be marrying him.
[02:57] I think there was a prior planning.
[03:00] People think a thousand times
before sending a proposal
[03:02] and they did it in a moment.
[03:04] There is something fishy,
there is something fishy.
[03:08] What are you doing here?
[03:09] The guests are asking for you.
[03:11] Why?
[03:12] Why are they asking for me?
When did I become so important?
[03:15] If I were important everything would be
happening according to me today,
[03:18] not according to that Rania.
[03:21] "Asking for me"
[03:22] And you should go,
go look for that Rania.
[03:24] If she is not here,
how will the world manage?
[03:27] Go, go.
[03:28] Mahir my child,
there is a time for everything,
[03:30] you should see if it's an appropriate time
before you get mad.
[03:32] Do you understand?
There are so many guests outside.
[03:34] How can Hammad manage on his own?
He can't even manage his hair,
[03:38] how can he manage the guests?
[03:39] And don't forget,
you are Rabail's brother.
[03:42] I don't approve of this relationship.
[03:44] You don't approve of this?
[03:47] People outside are happily
dancing like crazy.
[03:50] Now come on, come.
[03:54] Okay then,
[03:56] I'll also stand here and wait for you.
Even if my plan gets spoiled.
[04:01] I was going to dance,
a video was going to be recorded.
[04:03] My dance partner Rania,
she's also waiting for me.
[04:06] But doesn't matter.
[04:07] You can join us, it's not a problem
if you can dance with an injured leg.
[04:11] I'm not going outside.
[04:13] I don't want to go, I'm good here.
[04:15] You're good here?
[04:17] If that brother Rafique and family
can return and enjoy our event,
[04:22] then what are you?
[04:25] Uncle Rafique, returned?
[04:27] Yes, he went and returned,
everyone is celebrating,
[04:31] come and see for yourself
if you don't believe.
[04:34] Come on, let's go.
[04:35] For my sake, come on.
[04:38] Where did this woman
hide the passport?
[04:50] Brother Khawar, move aside a little.
[04:59] Everyone dances on their own happiness,
[05:02] what matters is when someone dances
on another's happiness.
[05:07] Now look,
[05:08] 2-3 dance moves are justified
for such a joyous occasion.
[05:12] People who got angry at your rejection
will also get happy.
[05:17] Really?
[05:19] Yes, have I ever given someone
the wrong advice?
[05:22] No.
[05:23] Then, come on letâ€™s go.
[05:27] Hey, brother Khawar is here,
brother Khawar is here.
[05:30] Look, was I lying?
[05:34] Everyone is happy.
[05:43] Have you seen it?
[05:45] Aunt.
[05:51] Clever girl,
[05:53] she made a fool out of everyone.
[05:57] Rania.
[05:58] Took advantage of my innocence.
[05:59] Had me on her side by talking sweet.
[06:03] Farhad? Like a brother?
[06:05] He's like her biological brother.
[06:08] Cheater, liar, and dishonest,
just like her.
[06:10] I won't spare him.
[06:25] It seems like nobody fed you sweets,
[06:28] let me get the sweets.
Don't try to be an over smart,
[06:30] I understand everything.
[06:32] All this planning, all this arrangement
is yours, right?
[06:35] Just look at me now,
you have underestimated me a lot.
[06:38] I'll end this relationship right now,
in a minute.
[06:42] What happened, are you mad?
[06:45] What do you even want,
[06:46] for two of Rabail's relationship
to fail in a day?
[06:50] First Khawar rejected
in front of everyone,
[06:52] now you're planning to scare off
Farhad as well.
[06:53] Poor Rabail won't be able
to take it anymore.
[06:56] And people will make grandmother's
life hell by taunts.
[07:02] And the respect lost won't be recovered even
by the dollars sent by your father.
[07:07] Think about it.
[07:08] First you sabotaged the relationship
with Khawar
[07:11] and now you have a problem
with Farhad?
[07:13] What, I did or you did?
How dramatic you are.
[07:17] Look, look at them,
[07:19] my sweet brother looks even
more cute while dancing.
[07:21] If he really looks that cute,
then go,
[07:24] be with him, dance with him,
[07:27] do whatever you want with him,
die with him.
[07:30] Okay, if someone asks me,
[07:33] I will tell them that his lover left him
and that's why he is in sorrow.
[07:38] Okay? Keep standing here,
I'm going.
[07:52] Brother, wait a second.
[07:54] One second, one second.
[07:57] How are you getting your
video recorded with this face?
[08:00] It's a video, not a picture.
[08:01] You'll regret it your whole life.
Smile or I'll tickle you, smile.
[08:06] Smile,
[08:11] a bigger smile.
[08:15] Brother? A solo.
[08:42] Father,
[08:44] you still wake me up like
I'm going to school.
[08:49] I've grown up now.
[08:52] You'll always be like
a little girl to me,
[08:54] the one who used to walk to school,
holding my hand,
[08:56] and the one I carried
on the way back home.
[08:58] The one who made a lot of demands.
[09:00] Really?
[09:02] I still make demands
but they don't come true.
[09:05] Really?
[09:06] When did it happen that you asked me
something and I didn't get it for you?
[09:08] That means it wasn't important,
my father forgot.
[09:12] Might have forgotten, tell me
what did you ask for?
[09:14] You don't remember?
[09:16] Give me a hint at least.
[09:19] I gave you a hint every day.
[09:22] Father, I want to study law.
[09:57] Coming.
[09:59] Hello?
Hello?
[10:01] Please, please listen to me,
don't hang up the phone.
[10:05] How many times we have told you
[10:08] to not waste our time or your time?
[10:12] You don't have any relation left with us.
[10:16] Even the memories died a death of time.
[10:21] I understand that I do not deserve
the forgiveness.
[10:24] But I still call anyway,
just in hope of one thing.
[10:29] You're the only one
[10:31] who can get me forgiveness
from father.
[10:35] Now I'll make a request to you.
[10:39] Don't call here,
[10:43] I've hardly picked up the pieces
of my existence,
[10:49] if it shatters again,
[10:52] I won't be able to hold myself together.
[10:55] Go back to your world
[10:58] and let us stay happy in ours.
[11:02] At least let me know
how is my daughter?
[11:07] What daughter?
[11:08] You don't have a daughter.
[11:10] Don't say this.
[11:11] The daughter's fathers are
very responsible,
[11:16] they save their daughter from
every harsh thing if the world,
[11:22] stay with her like a shadow.
[11:25] You left your young wife
[11:27] and daughter in the responsibility
of your old father Mr. Zaman.
[11:36] Think about it,
[11:39] do you deserve forgiveness?
[12:24] Father? What's the matter?
[12:27] Are you alright?
[12:28] Let me check your blood pressure.
[12:29] Oh no, I'm quite alright.
[12:37] Did you have dinner?
[12:42] Son, I was thinking I should go back.
[12:47] What do you mean father?
[12:49] Did I make a mistake?
[12:55] Son it's just that...
[13:01] I can find peace in these populated places.
[13:07] For the last 2 years,
[13:10] I was spending my retired life,
in a valley surrounded by the mountains.
[13:17] Probably that's better for me.
[13:23] Father, I cannot let you go in this condition,
[13:27] please get this thought out of your mind.
[13:32] I haven't eaten either,
[13:35] I'll ask them to serve the dinner
then we'll eat together.
[13:42] Okay.
[14:09] They own a cow farm.
[14:11] And apart from that
they have a clinic as well,
[14:14] one in the neighborhood,
the other is in Lahore.
[14:17] Along with the animals, he sometimes
treat humans as well.
[14:22] He has a sweet tooth that's why
he talks sweetly.
[14:27] Let us know how many animals
have you cured?
[14:34] I never counted
[14:38] but all the hens are satisfied with me.
[14:43] And all the cows as well,
there is a great business of milk.
[14:47] Brother Sadiq, tell them comfortably.
[14:51] Oh I brought farm eggs
and pure milk for Asma.
[14:57] You people can try as well.
[14:59] Yes but what matters to us, is the reputation,
background, not the eggs.
[15:06] Bebo?
[15:08] If you want to say talk about something
with the doctor then go ahead.
[15:13] Yes, I have an important inquiry.
[15:15] Actually the problem is my friend's dog
has gone mad,
[15:19] he's biting everyone at the street
for no reason,
[15:22] and the problem is he isn't
even telling us the reason.
[15:24] Can you discuss it with the dog
and find out the reason behind it?
[15:29] Yes I can,
[15:31] instead we can go right now
and talk to the dog.
[15:37] It's a yes from my side.
[15:42] It shouldn't be a problem
to go together.
[15:48] From our side, it's a.
No.
[15:56] Because I can't come in between
you and your cows.
[16:05] You can have the dessert.
[16:16] Thank God,
[16:18] Rabail will be getting married
to such a nice family.
[16:22] Because after listening to the stories surrounding
Khawar's character I was so worried.
[16:28] Farhad is a really nice guy
and family is good too.
[16:32] And did this madam tell you
about this?
[16:35] Yes, I told her, then?
[16:38] She said and you believed.
[16:41] She didn't know them
for ages either.
[16:43] It wasn't even a week and you decided
on Rabail's relationship.
[16:46] And you did very wrong with
Rabail by believing her.
[16:50] If it was really bad then
you could have found a proposal.
[16:54] God blessed this family with such
a great and calm son-in-law,
[16:58] and look at him.
Being ungrateful.
[17:01] Tell me grandmother,
[17:03] what did I do in all this?
[17:05] Did I force Farhad to get engaged
to Rabail at gunpoint?
[17:09] Not at all,
[17:10] it was their humanity that
they cared enough.
[17:13] Well I'm observing, you're getting
mannerless day by day.
[17:18] I think, there should be someone
in your life.
[17:21] Wow, what did you just say,
grandmother.
[17:24] Absolutely right.
[17:25] And you don't even have to look far away,
We have someone at our home, Mona.
[17:29] What a pair it'll be,
one arrogant the other idle.
[17:34] I mean, she's naive,
she'll agree easily.
[17:37] Because any smart girl won't even
look at such boys.
[17:41] If a person cannot say good things about
another one then they should stay quiet.
[17:46] Grandmother, please explain to her,
tell her to not interfere in my matters.
[17:50] And whoever I will marry,
will be my decision,
[17:54] not someone else's.
No what do you think,
[17:56] I'll find some random girl for you?
To make your bride?
[18:01] Yes, that's what I think.
[18:03] Because you havenâ€™t been thinking
with your own mind lately,
[18:05] you are thinking
with someone else's.
[18:08] Here we go,
started complaining again.
[18:11] Okay grandmother,
I am going to the university.
[18:13] Do you know my name is on the merit list,
that too on top.
[18:17] I have to go to the university,
for the rest of the process.
[18:19] Wow my child.
I'm sympathizing with the university.
[18:22] They'll have to face all this.
[18:25] What good is this verbal sympathy,
[18:28] it'll matter if you go then and
cancel my admission.
[18:33] Grandmother, call your brother
and tell him,
[18:37] it's better to get her married
[18:40] than spending whatever he has collected
all his life on her education.
[18:46] Because when girls like her go out
in the society they can cause a riot.
[18:51] My grandfather is not near-sighted
and narrow-minded like you.
[18:57] My grandfather is very broad-minded
[18:59] and has a progressive mind.
[19:04] Do you understand?
[19:05] Oh, leave him, let him be.
[19:07] How will you go to the university?
[19:09] I'll go by a taxi grandmother,
[19:11] uncle took the bike and I don't know
how to drive a car.
[19:15] I have asked your grandson
a number of times
[19:17] but he never taught me.
[19:19] Listen to me, go, and drop her off
at the University.
[19:23] What?
[19:25] Me, and drop her off?
[19:27] Grandmother, I don't have so much spare time
to drop her off at the university.
[19:30] There is a small request,
[19:32] so please don't ask me for the tasks of
such random, strange, and useless people.
[19:36] I'm leaving.
[19:38] You have no idea how much you've hurt me
with your words.
[19:44] Sorry grandmother,
but what can I do,
[19:46] I have to use such words because of
your brother's spoiled granddaughter.
[19:51] Let it be grandmother,
I'll go by myself,
[19:55] how long would it take maximum?
[19:57] 4 hours.
[20:01] It's okay.
[20:02] Have some shame,
have some shame.
[20:05] You've disgraced me.
[20:08] Let it be grandmother,
[20:10] why are you getting embarrassed?
[20:12] He is not even listening to you.
[20:15] It's not like that grandmother I really
have to go for something important.
[20:18] Where? To Salik?
Then to a restaurant?
[20:22] Let me tell you,
I'm not idle like you.
[20:25] I run my own business along
with the studies.
[20:27] I buy and sell properties,
I'm going for that.
[20:30] Here we go.
[20:34] Keep it up.
[20:35] You've disgraced your old grandmother.
[20:41] Leave him grandmother,
I'm leaving,
[20:44] don't worry, and take care of yourself.
[20:48] Bye.
[20:51] Listen,
[20:57] you're the guest at our house,
we have to serve you.
[21:01] Let's go?
[21:03] Thank you, grateful, indebted.
[21:06] Good job, son, good job.
[21:08] I knew you wouldn't ignore my request.
[21:11] Now go, take her to the university,
[21:13] and then bring her home,
how will she return alone?
[21:17] Bring her back as well?
[21:19] Should we go?
[21:20] You first.
[21:29] Bye.
[21:38] Nice, very nice,
[21:42] yay yay.
[21:49] Oh, how did the TV turn off?
[21:51] What happened brother?
[21:54] Hello? I'm missing the game.
[21:57] Oh brother what happened?
Why did you turn off?
[22:02] Where is the connection?
[22:05] Start working.
[22:10] Oh man.
[22:30] Whose passport is this?
[22:35] Yes, yes this is mine.
[22:38] This is my passport.
[22:41] Thank God, I found it,
found it.
[22:44] Man, in awe of this woman's mind.
[22:49] Where did she hide,
[22:51] I wouldn't have looked here all my life.
[22:54] you brother, thank you.
[22:55] I've found my passport because of you.
[22:58] Dabeer.
[23:01] Dabeer.
Yes, yes, yes?
[23:03] Why did you switch off the TV?
My favorite drama was up next.
[23:06] I didn't switch it off,
it turned off on its own,
[23:09] I was just trying to make it work.
[23:13] Where is the remote?
[23:14] Remote is right here but there might be
a problem from the back.
[23:18] I'll get back,
[23:20] I'll be back, in a minute,
I'll be back in a minute.
[23:25] Why do you always have
an upset stomach?
[23:39] Don't know where she is at.
[23:51] Should we leave if you are done?
[23:53] Now that you are going to the university,
stay reserved,
[23:56] don't start interfering in
everyone's matters there as well.
[24:00] Not everyone is cool minded like me
don't forget this.
[24:03] Okay, anything else?
[24:05] I am dropping you off only
because of grandmother,
[24:08] don't expect me to give you pick
and drop daily.
[24:13] I also don't have any interest,
[24:15] I'm going there out of compulsion,
who would want it?
[24:18] Can we go now?
Sit, have a seat.
[24:23] You are going there in a Prado,
[24:25] donâ€™t start bragging.
[24:28] Donâ€™t forget the lies donâ€™t last.
[24:31] Because if someone asks me,
Iâ€™ll tell them honestly,
[24:34] she came here by bus from Khushlalpur.
[24:37] Bragging is only a trait
for people like you.
[24:42] Smart girls like me always
have a plan B.
[24:45] I know your plan B.
[24:51] Stop the car, stop the car.
[24:52] What happened now?
I will tell you.
[24:55] Where are you going?
[24:57] Farhad, hi, are you going
to the university?
[24:59] Yes, why?
Could you drop yes well?
[25:02] Yes, why not?
Come, have a seat.
[25:03] Just a second.
[25:04] Mahir, you can go,
manage your great business.
[25:08] Iâ€™m leaving, bye.
[25:11] Hey.
[25:13] Bye.
[25:20] Thank you, man.
Itâ€™s okay, my pleasure.
[26:00] University ends a while ago.
[26:02] Where is she?
[26:08] Sister arrived.
[26:10] Sheâ€™s here? Then why isnâ€™t
she coming in?
[26:13] I didnâ€™t ask her to come in.
[26:16] I understand, she must have gone
to his house with him.
[26:19] Heâ€™s such a bitter person,
I know him very well.
[26:23] Brother Mahir,
who are you talking about?
[26:25] Who are you talking about?
[26:26] Monaâ€™s taxi.
[26:27] Where did this Mona come from?
[26:30] Here she is.
[26:33] Sister, give me the bags,
thatâ€™s my job.
[26:40] My Mona is leaving.
[26:42] Oh, okay okay, bye.
[26:46] Iâ€™ll be getting married, do attend
when Iâ€™ll invite you.
[26:50] Okay, okay. Iâ€™ll see.
[26:52] And if I couldnâ€™t attend it, I will send you
an envelope or a gift.
[26:54] Thatâ€™s your own choice
whether youâ€™ll come or not.
[26:56] Ok bye.
[26:59] Bye Mona.
[27:01] Iâ€™ll miss you.
[27:03] Call me.
[27:15] Thank you so much Farhad,
youâ€™re really nice.
[27:19] Bye.
Bye.
[27:30] Admission in university,
[27:32] that means another dream came true.
[27:35] Now Iâ€™ll keep moving forward
like this if God wills.
[27:42] You went to the university?
[27:43] Yes, so?
Can you see the time?
[27:46] Yes, such delicate times it is,
[27:49] a brother isnâ€™t true to their brother
in this time.
[27:52] Move away, why are you standing
in front of me like to this?
[27:54] For so long Iâ€™ve been concerned.
[27:58] Grandmother, has been concerned
for you for so long.
[28:00] And you donâ€™t care about her?
[28:02] I informed her while going.
[28:03] And Iâ€™m not returning at midnight
from a picnic.
[28:06] Move away Iâ€™ll talk to her by myself.
[28:08] Sheâ€™s not here, she went to the neighbors
[28:11] Oh, thatâ€™s good, for some time
I want to dream with my eyes open.
[28:15] Donâ€™t disturb me with your loud voice,
okay? Bye.
[28:24] Do you know
[28:26] when I went to the university with her,
[28:29] he took me for the ice cream.
Oh wow.
[28:32] And he also talked a lot.
[28:34] Do you want to know
what he was talking about?
[28:36] Tell me.
[28:37] He mentioned you in every sentence.
[28:39] I even got annoyed at one point.
[28:43] I said stop it now, but no,
he kept talking about you.
[28:48] He loves you a lot.
[28:50] Lucky you.
[28:53] I know thatâ€™s why I stay so happy.
[28:56] Listen to me,
[28:58] keep this University aside,
find a good guy, and get married.
[29:03] Youâ€™re exactly like your brother.
[29:06] You have the same mindset.
[29:07] Your brother said, marry her off.
[29:11] But I wonâ€™t let go of my purpose
because of people like Mahir.
[29:15] Let me get in power once.
[29:17] Then Iâ€™ll arrange for their 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th marriage as well.
[29:20] Then they will get to know.
[29:22] The ones who want me to get married.
[29:24] 4 marriages arenâ€™t a lot?
[29:25] Oh hello, hero.
[29:27] Youâ€™re posing really cute.
[29:29] Seems like youâ€™re trying to impress
your fiancÃ©, right?
[29:34] Seems like he heard my kind thoughts
about him secretly.
[29:41] Sister Anjum, let me clear it
for you today,
[29:44] he is not my fiancÃ©.
[29:46] What? Oh God.
He broke the engagement?
[29:50] Anyway, pretty boys are ugly at heart.
[29:54] But donâ€™t worry,
[29:56] I wonâ€™t let this happen to you,
I will go and talk to the hero.
[30:00] Hey, no, listen.
Come here, sit.
[30:02] Iâ€™ll tell you, come sit, sit, sit.
[30:05] Sit.
[30:06] It would be cruel only if there were
ever an engagement.
[30:10] There was never and engagement
and there never will.
[30:13] Itâ€™s better to die
then marry a person like that.
[30:20] Well Rania,
I couldnâ€™t completely grasp that.
[30:22] You canâ€™t possibly.
Tell me how are you visiting?
[30:26] Oh, I remembered.
[30:27] I am here to examine grandmother,
[30:29] she insisted at Rabailâ€™s engagement.
[30:33] And I also had to convey
Dr. Wasiqâ€™s message to you.
[30:36] What message?
[30:38] Actually, we are arranging a small event
at the childrenâ€™s ward of our hospital.
[30:43] We just want to make the set
and sad children happy.
[30:48] Just for a short time but we are
trying to help with their pain.
[30:52] And Dr. Wasiq really wants you
to attend.
[30:55] Me?
[30:56] Yes.
Itâ€™s such a kind act,
[30:58] Iâ€™ll definitely come and participate.
[31:01] Okay.
[31:03] Now tell me the story in detail,
[31:05] whatâ€™s with you and Mahir?
[31:08] Ideal couple,
isnâ€™t a couple anymore?
[31:12] Oh God, oh my God.
[31:15] Okay, okay, donâ€™t cry.
[31:17] Iâ€™m ideal, him?
Heâ€™s a bad idea.
[31:21] Itâ€™s a long story,
listen carefully.
[31:29] Who wants this car?
Are you interested in cars?
[31:32] You want this?
Will you play with this?
[31:34] Here you go then, itâ€™s yours.
[31:36] Very nice.
[31:37] There are a lot of gifts for you all as well.
Who wants this? Bat and ball?
[31:40] You?
[31:42] Youâ€™re good at cricket?
Here you go then. Itâ€™s yours.
[31:47] And this will be yours and this, yours.
[31:52] Wait a second,
[31:54] why are all the children so bored?
[31:57] Youâ€™re my friends, right?
Right?
[31:59] Then youâ€™ll have to be active like me,
[32:02] stay happy like me and laugh like me.
Like this.
[32:05] Good job.
[32:07] You all are so brave.
[32:09] All of you are like me.
[32:12] Are you scared of insects?
[32:15] No, Iâ€™m not scared
of the mouse as well.
[32:19] Whatâ€™s funny in it?
You donâ€™t think Iâ€™m brave?
[32:23] Just a little?
[32:24] Just a little? Not a lot?
[32:32] Grandmother?
[32:35] Yes, grandmother?
Son Mahir, where are you?
[32:39] Iâ€™m on my way home.
[32:41] Do one thing, Rania is out,
she went to Dr. Wasiqâ€™s hospital,
[32:49] so when you return pick her up.
[32:52] Hospital? Why?
Is everything alright?
[32:54] Yes, yes, everything is alright,
[32:57] but there is an event at the hospital
so Dr. Wasiq invited her.
[33:02] So pick her up on your way home.
[33:04] Grandmother, even we donâ€™t know
enough people in so many years
[33:08] than she got to know
in such a small time.
[33:10] What are you saying?
[33:12] Nothing, I will bring her.
[33:14] Okay, well, bye.
[33:20] I donâ€™t know what events are happening.
[33:23] I think this doctor is interested and her.
[33:28] This Rania, spoiled my mood.
[33:34] Friendship with everyone,
talks to everyone.
[33:37] She thinks of this city
as her grandfatherâ€™s Khushalpur.
[33:41] I have to do something about her.
[33:50] Father.
[33:52] Greetings father.
[33:55] How does it all look?
[33:56] It looks great.
[33:58] Rania, this is Dr. Wasiqâ€™s father.
[34:01] Hey, father.
[34:03] This is Rania, she agreed on my one call,
on my request.
[34:08] And sheâ€™s such a nice girl.
[34:09] Really?
Yes.
[34:11] She decorated the whole ward,
[34:13] in fact, helping me keep children happy
and making them smile.
[34:17] Youâ€™re doing a great job.
[34:20] Because only the people who spread
happiness deserves to be called human.
[34:26] Youâ€™re definitely a great girl,
[34:28] your parents taught you well.
[34:33] Thank you.
[34:35] Well, how long are you going to take?
[34:38] Iâ€™m here to pick you up.
[34:40] Father, Iâ€™ll get a little late.
[34:44] Do one thing, have a seat here, today
weâ€™ll have lunch with all these children.
[34:50] Yes, yes, sure.
[34:51] Thank you father.
Come, please, have a seat.
[34:54] Sister will you tell us a story?
[34:58] I can also tell a story.
[35:01] No, I donâ€™t want to listen to you.
[35:03] You give injections
and bitter medicines.
[35:09] Bad habit, good ones
donâ€™t talk to elders like this.
[35:12] All of you are really good children,
[35:15] you have to have the bitter medicines
and the injection as well,
[35:19] how else will you get better?
You want to go home soon?
[35:24] Then you have to bear this,
[35:25] these doctors and
nurses are your friends,
[35:29] just like Iâ€™m your friend.
[35:31] All of us want you to get well soon,
[35:34] get healthy soon,
[35:36] and go back to your homes happily.
[35:40] Okay so Iâ€™ll tell you a story.
Want to hear it?
[35:44] Iâ€™ll tell you a story
about a very brave girl,
[35:47] who wanted to become
a prime minister.
