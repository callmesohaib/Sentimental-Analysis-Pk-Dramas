[00:18] Bebo.
[00:21] Father's condition isn't getting
any better,
[00:24] doctor has written more tests,
[00:27] how will we manage all that?
[00:31] Everything will be managed
sister-in-law,
[00:34] don't worry.
[00:37] I was thinking
[00:38] the money uncle put aside
for Rania's wedding,
[00:42] we should use it for his treatment,
we will save again.
[00:46] We only have to convince him
to move to Lahore,
[00:50] and Bebo you have to help me with it,
I can't do it alone.
[00:57] Rania is calling.
[00:59] Sister-in-law, don't tell her anything
about father's condition,
[01:03] she will get worried and
father won't like it either.
[01:09] Better.
[01:11] Hello, my child, how are you?
[01:13] I'm fine, how are you all?
[01:15] And where is grandfather?
What is he doing,
[01:17] he's not answering my calls.
[01:20] Father fell asleep a while ago,
[01:23] did you see the time,
it's not the time to be awake.
[01:25] Bebo and I were having a conversation
[01:28] but why didn't you sleep yet?
[01:29] I was about to sleep,
[01:32] actually mother I wanted
to talk about something.
[01:37] Yes, yes my child tell me,
everything alright?
[01:39] I'm thinking to shift at a hostel
instead of grandmother's house.
[01:46] At a hostel? Why is that?
[01:51] Actually, I cannot study here,
[01:54] there is a lot of disturbance
and always some noise,
[01:57] that's why I thought I should move to a hostel,
[02:00] I'll study with dedication.
[02:01] Ms. Disturbance,
[02:03] the ones who want to study can
study under the streetlights,
[02:08] they don't get disturbed,
and they manage everything.
[02:11] You're not a daughter of an elite man,
[02:13] you're the granddaughter of
an old weak man,
[02:15] who's fighting so many conditions
just to fulfil your dream.
[02:19] I knew you'll never approve,
[02:22] I'll talk to grandfather on my own.
[02:24] Don't you dare Rani,
that you talk to uncle,
[02:27] I won't spare you.
[02:28] If there is that much disturbance that
you can't study, then damn it and come back.
[02:32] Get the thoughts of higher education
out of your mind.
[02:35] Mother what are you talking about?
[02:38] I am absolutely right Rani,
[02:39] uncle does not have enough strength anymore
to waste money on you, you need to understand.
[02:44] Mother is everything alright?
[02:48] Yes, yes, everything is alright,
[02:51] you just made me angry with these
stupid thoughts of yours.
[02:56] Look Rani, your mother
is absolutely right,
[02:59] look, running away from
your problems is not bravery,
[03:02] you need to face the challenges,
that's courage.
[03:07] And when you talk about going to the hostel
earlier grandmother didn't like it,
[03:11] if you mention it again
she will get offended.
[03:15] That's why you should live in their house
and only focus on your studies
[03:18] and ignore everything else.
[03:21] But Bebo,
[03:23] I don't think I will be able
to stay here for long.
[03:26] Look Rani, don't be so stubborn.
[03:29] Look Rani, if you cannot manage everything
then leave it and come back.
[03:34] End it all.
[03:35] Mother.
[03:48] Come on, hurry up, I can't even have
my breakfast comfortably because of you.
[03:52] Fast.
[03:54] Seema listen to me I am going
to drop them off,
[03:57] make hot and fresh flatbread and
omelette for when I will return.
[04:01] So I could have breakfast properly.
Okay?
[04:04] Hammad, it won't make it any better,
[04:06] even if you have breakfast 4 times,
you won't be comfortable.
[04:11] Why?
[04:14] Oh come on, come on, we're getting late,
get your bag, bag, bag.
[04:17] You didn't brush your hair?
Oh they're brushed, come on.
[04:20] Say bye, bye.
[04:22] Bye children.
[04:23] Sweetie, where is Dabeer?
Tell him to come and have breakfast.
[04:25] Mother, he's asleep.
[04:27] He got up early the last 2-3 days
because of you all,
[04:30] and now he's back to his routine.
[04:54] Grandmother, I have to raise
an objection to you.
[04:57] Yes, tell me, what happened?
[05:00] Grandmother, does my future fiancé,
this darling Khawar,
[05:04] does he have no respect
in this house?
[05:06] Yesterday Mahir, called him
names. Why?
[05:12] Good thing you reminded me
I also wanted to tell you,
[05:15] something grandmother, last night
a group of snakes came to me.
[05:18] They were really offended
by Mahir's comment,
[05:20] they recorded a proper protest.
[05:28] Have some shame,
he's our son-in-law.
[05:31] Respect him, it's true
that he's a good kid.
[05:36] And Mona, don't be so emotional,
[05:39] he also means something to them
[05:41] and they have a right to joke with him.
[05:44] And listen, in a few days,
[05:45] you will be saying Mahir and
Rania were absolutely right,
[05:48] he's indeed a snake.
[05:50] Grandmother, did you hear that?
[05:52] Have your breakfast quietly,
don't speak anything.
[06:03] Okay grandmother,
I'm leaving, I'm getting late.
[06:06] Then I'll drop you, let's go.
No, there is no need for that.
[06:10] What? How will you go?
[06:13] I am going just there, it will be in my route,
I will drop you.
[06:16] Grandmother,
say something, tell her.
[06:17] You should go with him, he'll drop you,
he has to take the same route,
[06:21] why would you suffer in public bus.
[06:24] Okay,
[06:27] I'll get the bag.
Okay I'll wait outside.
[06:39] There is a limit to everything,
[06:40] this girl that has been living in this house
and eating for free,
[06:43] I really dislike her.
[06:45] Who are you talking about?
Who?
[06:47] When you sit there being all clueless,
I hate it.
[06:52] I am talking about Rania,
[06:53] why does she have a spacious
well-furnished bedroom?
[06:55] She roams around this house
like she's the future owner.
[06:59] Oh, her, she's only here
to complete her studies,
[07:02] her grandfather is mother's first cousin,
[07:07] and they both love each other
like real siblings.
[07:10] Well there is something Sweetie,
[07:15] you've been forgetting our customs and traditions
from here since you've been living in America.
[07:19] Our elders have a lot of love,
they maintain their relationships.
[07:25] These sympathies of yours,
have you ever thought?
[07:28] How many useless people
do you have in your house?
[07:30] Your brother, who runs away from work
as a doctor has prescribed against it.
[07:33] And your sister-in-law's
ill-minded sister Mona,
[07:36] and then your niece Rabail.
[07:38] Why do all of them stay in this house?
[07:40] She's my deceased sister's daughter,
[07:42] mother's real granddaughter.
[07:44] Okay I accept that she's your niece,
but that Rania?
[07:48] She doesn't have any right over is,
she's eating for free here.
[07:51] Sweetie, I just told you,
she is mother's brother's granddaughter,
[07:55] she's an innocent girl,
[07:57] what harm is she causing you?
Let her stay here.
[08:00] All these useless people
are causing me harm,
[08:02] they're being fed on our dollars,
[08:04] and I think she came up with a plan
to seize all this property.
[08:09] Seize the property? Whose?
[08:12] My property, who’s else?
[08:14] Sweetie,
[08:16] your property is out there in America,
[08:18] and to go there,
we can’t even get visa to go there.
[08:21] How can Rania go there and
seize your property?
[08:25] Everything here,
this is also mine.
[08:29] I'm only giving respect to your mother
because Honey asked me to.
[08:32] You know I feel disgraced
to respect others.
[08:37] Yes, yes, that I know,
that I know.
[08:40] So now, kick all these useless people
out of this house
[08:43] or I'll have to do something on my own.
[08:50] I explained it to aunt
[08:52] and she is still behaving like this?
[08:54] Convince her, convince her Honey,
convince her.
[08:58] You know as fat as she is,
her mind is even more dense.
[09:05] She does not understand
if you only tell her once.
[09:09] My child, for God's sake,
please convince her.
[09:11] If she stays here 2-4 more days,
[09:13] she will destroy all the love
of our family.
[09:20] Honey, do something,
[09:22] and to get property in her name
she has been playing with the whole family.
[09:28] Uncle, don't worry,
I'll come to Pakistan very soon,
[09:31] and I'll fix everything
as soon as I arrive.
[09:33] Oh, thank you Honey, my child.
[09:36] You lifted 250g weight off my chest
by giving this news.
[09:42] You don't have to let it
weigh you down,
[09:44] you did all the hard work on the store,
[09:46] I know all this property belongs to you,
[09:49] your mother and your son.
[09:51] Aunt doesn't have any right over it.
[09:53] Honey my child, Honey, listen, come soon,
[09:56] I'd say take a flight and get here right now
so we could end this argument.
[10:01] I will.
[10:02] Okay bye, bye Honey, bye.
[10:06] Thank you, God.
[10:09] Honey my child,
[10:10] nobody can reason with that
arrogant woman except you.
[10:14] Mona got it made specially.
Greetings Aunt.
[10:16] Oh you, how are you.
[10:20] Exactly how he looks like, right?
[10:22] Look at him, pure gold buttons
on branded shalwar-kameez,
[10:26] doesn't he look like
shiney-happy Khawar.
[10:30] Brother Hammad,
[10:31] where are you going, greet him
look who's here.
[10:35] He saw that's why
he was going back.
[10:37] How are you brother Khawar?
[10:39] It seems like you have shopped for expensive
things again that's why you are here to show it.
[10:42] Only the one who has the money,
shows off, right?
[10:47] That's absolutely true,
[10:50] poor Rania is an orphan
[10:52] and her grandfather is only headmaster,
[10:54] oh, retired headmaster.
[10:57] And also she used to live in a village?
[11:00] It’s about a person's capabilities aunt,
[11:03] even if I had the money
I'd still won't show off.
[11:06] Actually my grandfather taught me,
[11:08] only the empty pots
make the most noise,
[11:10] the people who're empty are the ones
who show off.
[11:17] Brother Khawar, you came alone?
[11:19] You should've brought
along sister as well.
[11:21] Hey Rabail, did you forget?
[11:23] Only one person uses a car
at a time at their place.
[11:26] Hey brother Khawar, you didn't
tell all this to aunt Sweetie?
[11:30] She gets really impressed
by such things.
[11:33] In the past, uncle Rafique asked
for some money from grandmother,
[11:36] they had some problem
so grandmother helped.
[11:40] So if you want you can claim
that money as well
[11:43] because father sent the money to grandmother
which means they were yours,
[11:47] so if you want you can do this.
[11:49] Shut up Mahir, behave yourself.
[11:51] What did I say? Instead,
I spoke in your favor.
[11:54] I know very well
why you are so jealous,
[11:59] I'm not stupid or crazy to get mad
about all these comments.
[12:03] How am I stuck in this bullfighting?
[12:05] I'll leave, I'll leave.
Sit.
[12:07] Brother Khawar leave
after you have the tea,
[12:09] it's a tradition that we don't let
the guests go without having anything.
[12:13] And who am I to think of you as a
stupid arrogant and stubborn?
[12:17] You're so smart
[12:19] that since you got here you ruined
the whole management of this house.
[12:23] Yes,
[12:24] the environment of this house
did change for you,
[12:27] earlier you used to roam around
in the car now you're on a bike.
[12:30] Earlier you used to shop often
now you are dependent for money.
[12:34] The environment did change
since I got here.
[12:36] Your thinking is severely wrong,
[12:38] wealth and money do not have
an importance in human life,
[12:42] I am talking about respect,
[12:44] relationships and love that
you can never understand.
[12:47] Rania and Rabail, let's go,
[12:49] we don't have anything to do here.
Yes, let's go.
[12:51] You sit.
[12:53] Brother leave
after you have the tea,
[12:54] it's a tradition that we don't let
the guests go without having anything.
[13:00] Drink the tea then leave.
[13:02] Darling, tea?
[13:04] No.
[13:05] I have been lenient
for too long now
[13:07] I think I have to take a strict action.
[13:10] Dabeer, Dabeer.
[13:13] Tea.
[13:14] Your customs can go to hell,
that Mahir only broke my button yet,
[13:17] he'll come back and break me.
I'm leaving.
[13:20] Stop, Khawar, listen to me.
[13:22] Mona, pass the chocolate biscuits.
[13:24] Yes, but.
[13:26] Very bad, very bad,
[13:28] you misbehaved a lot with Sweetie.
[13:31] It's okay if she's a step-parent
but she's your mother.
[13:35] Stop this father,
[13:37] you've done really bad to me,
[13:38] you've been in America for so long
and you didn't even earn a penny?
[13:42] You were the slave of that
aunt Sweetie your whole life?
[13:45] I used to ask for money
[13:47] because you're my father
[13:49] and a son has all the rights
over father's earnings.
[13:52] Little did I know,
[13:53] you used to send me all the dollars
taking from her.
[13:57] What will happen to my life?
[13:59] I've spent such a luxury life
[14:01] and now what she's doing with me.
[14:03] She leaves me no good,
what am I going to tell people.
[14:07] Enough? Are you done talking?
[14:09] It's fine that store was her,
she owned it
[14:13] but my son I worked hard
my whole life,
[14:16] I did all the labor.
[14:17] Physically,
physically it was my hard work.
[14:21] There is a limit, I used to send
my hard earned money.
[14:24] Son we need to use politics,
[14:26] we should try to befriend her,
[14:29] it's okay that she's a little difficult
[14:32] but we have to be smart, right?
[14:36] Just a little difficult?
Yes.
[14:38] Father,
[14:40] what she's doing with Rania,
[14:42] how she insults her every now and then,
that doesn't mean anything.
[14:46] So, all the problems
you have against Sweetie,
[14:52] you're doing this because of Rania?
[14:54] Tell me one thing,
[14:56] do you have a soft spot
in your heart for Rania?
[15:03] No uncle, there is nothing like that,
[15:08] I am here for a very noble cause,
I need to complete my studies.
[15:14] I can't think anything like that from Mahir,
[15:20] please take this misunderstanding
out of our mind.
[15:22] You're saying right, it's true?
[15:26] Then the problem is solved,
[15:29] there is nothing to worry about.
[15:31] Don't worry both of you,
go and take rest.
[15:34] Just give me this and
take away the tray.
[15:44] I'm understanding everything,
[15:46] why he's having
so many sympathies
[15:49] but I won't fall for that.
[15:59] How fast she replied that
there is nothing between us.
[16:25] Why didn't you tell father
the whole thing?
[16:28] What thing?
[16:29] That, you're the future
prime minister of Pakistan.
[16:34] I'd say you should add me
in your party,
[16:38] I'll chant so loud,
I'll run such campaigns
[16:41] that no matter people vote for you
or not they'll definitely give you love.
[16:45] Will you include?
[16:46] God's forgiveness,
[16:47] I mistakenly told you one thing
and you picked it.
[16:49] Obviously, if it’s something
like this I'll have to hold it.
[16:57] Hey, tell me the name of the party.
[16:58] Your head.
[17:00] My head?
[17:09] Yes sir, it was Sunday
[17:12] so I thought I can work for a few hours,
[17:15] yes sir, just that
I don't like being at home,
[17:19] I'm getting so used to of office that
I wanted some today as well.
[17:22] What? You were sleeping?
[17:25] Okay, sorry, sir sorry.
[17:29] Hello?
[17:31] Actually, they can't run
the office without me.
[17:33] Wow, uncle has been
really happy lately.
[17:38] Yes, and all the credit goes to you.
[17:40] What did I do?
I only motivated him,
[17:43] uncle did the rest on his own.
[17:46] You're absolutely right.
[17:48] Uncle has been really fit lately,
they talk daily,
[17:51] this damned love is something like this,
and it changes the human.
[17:57] I think, before Farhad,
I will be married,
[18:01] actually she only gave
a hint to send proposal.
[18:06] Really?
[18:07] That's a really good news uncle.
[18:09] But there is a problem,
[18:13] you have to play a double role here.
[18:18] I mean you have to talk to sister as well
so that she could take my proposal
[18:22] and then you have to talk to
grandfather as well
[18:25] to approve of my proposal.
[18:28] Actually my sister,
expect a no from her 98%,
[18:32] she's not agreeing,
[18:34] and I've heard grandfather
let his dogs loose,
[18:37] if someone asks for his family member
in marriage.
[18:39] No there is nothing like this,
it's all a lie.
[18:41] You don't have to worry,
I do this happily.
[18:45] Okay then it's fine,
you should talk to mother happily
[18:48] and already mother doesn't say
no to you.
[18:50] Grandfather won't say no either,
[18:53] I'll do this, today I'll call him
and talk to him, okay?
[18:56] This aunt Seema was taunting my Bebo,
[18:59] now she'll see my Bebo's groom,
[19:02] then see how surprised she'll be.
[19:06] My uncle doesn't even
know how to blush,
[19:08] how many things
do I have to teach you?
[19:10] Oh don't worry,
I'll teach him how to blush,
[19:13] but you should please
talk to grandfather, please.
[19:15] Yes okay,
[19:17] they'll I'll go like this and return like this,
then we'll talk to your mother too.
[19:19] Thank you.
[19:20] Thank you.
She's a wonderful girl,
[19:22] I became her fan, well-done.
[19:24] It's good to blush but I'll help you
practice how to blush.
[19:28] Should I do.
[19:34] Shehenshah, pour more juice,
come on,
[19:37] let’s drink the juice,
the whole glass.
[19:42] Oh my God.
Take the whole glass.
[19:49] Hey Sweetie,
[19:51] it's enough now I'm tired,
[19:53] we'll do the rest tomorrow.
[19:54] No, no, no, we'll have
to do everything today,
[19:57] won't leave anything for tomorrow.
[19:58] What have you done to my lawn,
[20:00] well understandable,
[20:02] who cares about someone else’s property?
[20:04] Now that I am here I will protect
my lawn and my house on my own.
[20:09] Okay, this pot, the heavy one,
quickly put it away.
[20:12] Sweetie, it's a really heavy pot,
[20:15] hey come here Shehenshah,
what are you doing sitting there?
[20:18] Come here with me.
[20:20] You dare say something
to Shahenshah again I like this,
[20:23] use your child labor get your
passport cancelled.
[20:27] Don't you feel ashamed,
[20:28] asking such a young boy to do all this,
heavy lifting?
[20:31] You're always saying something to me.
[20:41] Listen to me,
[20:42] these two of your relatives
that are passing from here,
[20:44] call them here and ask them
to move the pots, come on, fast.
[20:48] Sweetie, you're wonderful,
she's such a skinny girl,
[20:51] soft and delicate,
will they be able to lift these?
[20:55] That's the only way I have to
kick them all out of here.
[20:59] You want all of us to run away from here,
[21:01] but I won't let this happen.
[21:06] Take this strawberry, this one,
[21:08] look how red it is, eat this.
[21:22] Father,
[21:29] father.
[22:21] Rania.
[22:24] Hello, Rani, how are you?
[22:27] Leave me, tell me
where is grandfather,
[22:29] his phone is off whenever I call him,
[22:31] I have to talk to him but something
very important, let me talk to him.
[22:34] Rani, father is.
[22:36] Do you know what I am going
to talk to him about?
[22:38] About your and
uncle Ayaz's relationship.
[22:41] Also he will ask for your opinion,
[22:44] don't waste time in getting shy
just straight away tell him
[22:46] he's one in a million,
I will take care of your rest, okay?
[22:49] Get him on the phone.
[22:52] Rani, father went
to check on his land,
[22:54] he probably didn't have networks there.
[22:57] You can call later
[22:58] Oh,
[23:01] okay what can we do,
[23:05] if it's a delay from God's side.
[23:08] Well you must have mentioned
uncle Ayaz with mother,
[23:12] what was her reaction?
[23:13] Rani I am busy at the moment,
can we talk later? Bye
[23:17] Bye? Hello?
[23:27] What's going on?
[23:30] Why are they distracting me?
[23:33] Oh my God,
did she change her mind?
[23:50] Hello?
[23:55] Hello?
[23:59] I'm Asma speaking.
[24:01] Asma?
[24:03] Asma how are you my child?
[24:06] Is everything alright?
[24:09] Can you come home
at this time brother?
[24:13] Father’s condition is really bad.
[24:20] He is in need of your support,
[24:24] you should come and
take away his pain.
[24:29] Give peace to his weak existence.
[24:34] Complete your obligation.
[24:36] Father is sick?
[24:38] I’m coming Asma, I am just leaving,
you take care of him.
[25:00] Sister-in-law,
[25:03] don’t call my decision wrong,
[25:06] the father is getting really weak,
[25:11] he is not able to fight this disease,
[25:14] he is in need of support,
in need of a treatment.
[25:20] I didn’t beg brother for anything,
[25:23] neither had I asked for a favor,
[25:26] I just reminded him of his duty.
[25:30] And talked about the right
that father has over him,
[25:36] all the complaints aside sister-in-law,
[25:39] but at this moment
we all have to think about father.
[25:46] Rani,
[25:51] Rania is really emotional,
[25:55] it won’t be easy for her
to accept all this.
[26:03] Whether you forgive him
or not that is your choice,
[26:12] I won’t force you for this.
[26:42] How is father?
[26:45] Come inside.
[26:51] Father,
[26:53] father.
[26:56] Yes?
[27:06] How are you father?
[27:17] Father,
[27:21] father please forgive me father.
[27:29] If you won’t forgive me
God won’t forgive me either.
[27:37] Yes, I’ve forgiven him,
[27:47] you should also forgive him.
[27:55] I know I am terrible,
[27:59] I don’t deserve forgiveness
[28:02] but
[28:04] please do this favor to me.
[28:19] I’ve protected your valuables
with all honesty,
[28:32] saved them from the scorching sun
with the whole existence of mine.
[28:39] But now I’m tired,
[28:43] broken,
[28:47] your valuables are
your responsibility now.
[29:41] Grandmother,
[29:44] give me a head massage.
[29:46] Mother’s sacrifice,
oil massage? Go get it.
[29:50] Why do we bring it,
I’ll ask Shehenshah.
[29:52] Shehenshah.
[29:54] Listen to me, if you live and
this place then do some work.
[29:58] Work?
[30:00] I don’t a habit of working.
[30:02] Now you’ll ask me to iron the clothes,
I’ll burn them,
[30:05] ask me to dust, something will break.
[30:08] Yes, if you ask me to cook
then you’ll have to starve,
[30:11] but it’ll be a good diet for you.
[30:15] You are talking as if you are
daughter of a landlord.
[30:19] Mother, I’ve decided today
onwards except Shehenshah,
[30:24] all the extra chores will be done by her,
Mona and Rabail.
[30:26] And that Seema,
she’s idle all day,
[30:29] she’ll do all the work
in the kitchen.
[30:31] I was doing all the chores
for so many days,
[30:33] now I have decided
this is going to happen.
[30:36] You made this decision.
[30:38] Yes I’ll decide, who else would?
[30:42] These decisions of yours will be
implied at your home,
[30:47] this house is mine
[30:49] I will make all the decisions.
[30:51] Servants, I’m thinking
we should get one or two more,
[30:55] what do you think?
There is a need.
[30:58] It’s such a big house.
[30:59] You have gone mad mother-in-law.
[31:02] Oh I’ll die, what are you saying sister?
[31:05] Don’t do this, she’ll slap you across
the face so bad in anger
[31:09] that you’ll have to treat it for 4 days.
[31:13] I am speaking from experience,
[31:15] well I would say mother let’s have,
this be the lion.
[31:18] House belongs to the one who paid for it.
[31:21] No, I mean house belongs to the one
who has the documents in their name.
[31:27] I’m just like this, this house
will go to my son Mahir.
[31:32] What?
Yes.
[31:33] Dabeer.
[31:34] Listen.
Dabeer.
[31:37] Listen, from where did uncle Dabeer
come in this situation?
[31:39] That poor man gets in trouble
for everything.
[31:40] Doesn’t get it without any reason,
he was the one who brought her here.
[31:44] I thought she got better but
she lost her mind again.
[31:50] Dabeer,
[31:51] Dabeer.
[31:52] Ms. Making decisions here,
[31:54] I have also decided now I will act like
a Queen instead of mother-in-law.
[32:00] Wow, It’ll be fun.
[32:03] And listen, come here,
[32:05] she also needs a treatment terribly.
[32:08] What happened mother,
what did I do?
[32:10] What did you do?
You became so diplomatic,
[32:13] here for a moment and
there the next moment.
[32:15] You became a spoon.
[32:16] And go call your useless husband,
[32:19] both of you are taking
advantage of my leniency.
[32:22] Okay mother.
[32:25] Wow mother, it was amazing,
[32:28] what Punjabi movie did you watch
before falling asleep last night?
[32:30] I don’t need to watch any Punjabi movie,
I myself am a film.
[32:36] I want to scold everyone
to show Sweetie,
[32:40] so she won’t take me lightly.
I’m a very difficult woman.
[32:45] What a wonder you are,
[32:47] I thought you lost the presidency
of this house from your hands
[32:50] but I was wrong.
[32:52] Oh my grandmother.
[32:55] Listen to me call Dabeer,
[32:59] I’ll give him a dose as well
he also needs that,
[33:02] You’re absolutely right,
I will call him right now.
[33:04] Yes.
Mother, Hammad is sleeping.
[33:07] What time is this to sleep?
Go wake him up,
[33:09] if she doesn’t wake up then
pour a jug of water on him.
[33:12] Bucket.
[33:13] And your Mona,
[33:15] if I see her wandering somewhere
wearing makeup I’ll kick her,
[33:20] tell her kid’s study is
her responsibility today.
[33:25] Mother my kids will fail.
Let them be.
[33:30] And Rania you.
[33:31] Yes.
[33:32] You came here to study,
I’ve never seen you studying,
[33:35] today onwards whenever I see you,
you must have a book in your hand.
[33:38] Yes mother.
[33:40] Yes Salik I do have some money.
[33:43] and that’s what I’ve thought
I’ll invest them somewhere
[33:45] and then I’ll run the house
with the profit I get.
[33:47] Brother, you need experience
for business.
[33:50] You’ll waste what you’re left with.
[33:52] I have to take the risk dude,
[33:55] I also have some dignity,
[33:57] I can’t get insulted by
Mrs. Dabeer daily over dollars.
[34:02] You had an attitude over this wealth,
[34:05] you were so arrogant,
and you made fun of me
[34:08] and even had a bet on me.
[34:11] Maybe nature taught you a lesson.
[34:15] Dude,
[34:17] the advices are right but
we have to do something now.
[34:20] I can’t take this anymore.
[34:23] But I can’t be happy
about your situation,
[34:26] my grandfather didn’t teach me
to smile on someone’s pain,
[34:29] I still have sympathies for you.
[34:31] I’ll help you.
[34:33] I’ll talk to them, okay? Relax.
[34:36] Okay.
[34:37] Hey, Rania, wait.
Salik I’ll call you later.
[34:39] Have a seat,
I need to talk to you.
[34:44] Speak.
[34:45] I was going to say,
[34:49] Rania please help me,
[34:52] get some idea or some remedy,
how do we tackle Mrs. Dabeer?
[34:56] She’s in tolerable.
[34:58] She insults me every now and then.
[35:00] Now everyone can’t function according
to your choice, your likes and dislikes,
[35:06] so it’s better for you
to build tolerance.
[35:09] I’ve tried to tolerate,
but I can’t,
[35:13] and I think she’ll directly attack
on me now.
[35:17] Then you should make yourself attack-proof
instead of focusing on her.
[35:22] This matter isn’t as light
as you’re taking this,
[35:25] she’s in hopes of excluding me
from my house
[35:29] and I’ve heard it,
she was talking to some lawyer
[35:33] so maybe legally or by going to a court,
she wants to seize this house, car and property.
[35:40] So what?
[35:41] You’ll live in a small house without
a car and without any facility.
[35:47] There will be a problem,
[35:49] how will you look at other people
like they’re inferior?
[35:52] And how will you show off?
[35:55] Hey, then you
and I will be equals,
[35:59] that you won’t be able to process,
it’ll be a little difficult.
[36:03] Your replies sound like you
disliked my comments,
[36:07] Did I hurt you?
[36:09] Forgive me dude.
[36:12] I don’t get hurt over
small things like this,
[36:14] actually I know some people are habitual
[36:19] but if you can realize the ugliness
of your behavior then it’s a good thing.
[36:27] Will you help me in this matter?
[36:30] I’ll think about it.
[36:32] You’ll still think about it?
I just apologized
[36:39] What?
[36:41] Zaman has returned?
[36:44] And Anwar forgave him?
[36:47] Grandmother,
actually father is really sick,
[36:52] he needs a support in this condition.
[36:56] And brother has taken all the
responsibilities since he came,
[36:59] we’ve forgiven him.
[37:02] But Rania,
[37:05] she doesn’t even
know her father is alive,
[37:08] and despite being alive he always
stayed away from her responsibilities.
[37:14] I don’t know if she’ll be able to forgive him
when she finds out.
[37:18] Look,
[37:20] she’s a young blood,
[37:22] it’ll be really difficult for her,
the matter has greatly escalated.
[37:28] You just tell Rania that
father is really sick,
[37:33] and she should come back
for a few days,
[37:36] then when she’ll return
I’ll manage everything here.
[37:39] My brother is sick then
how can I stay here?
[37:43] I’ll bring Rania along with me, okay?
[37:47] Okay, bye.
[37:50] Okay, okay, bye, bye.
[37:53] Mahir,
[37:55] hey Mahir, listen to me.
[38:01] Enough, enough,
[38:04] why are you getting worried?
[38:06] Asma called and she said your
grandfather is a lot better now,
[38:12] if God wills he’ll be fine.
Enough my child.
[38:15] That’s why grandfather
wasn’t answering my calls,
[38:18] if Bebo or mother would’ve told me
earlier I’d be with grandfather by now.
[38:23] Everything will be alright,
you’ll see,
[38:25] your grandfather will be fine soon.
[38:29] Both of us will go together,
she’ll get worried alone,
[38:33] then do this,
take our bags to the car.
[38:37] Okay grandmother.
In the car? I’ll need the car.
[38:40] Say no, tell her no,
[38:43] or I’ll say something to her by
leaving she’ll be dancing on one leg.
[38:47] I’m going and I’ll make all the decisions
when I come back.
[38:51] Sweetie, is it the time
to talk about all this?
[38:55] Mother, go peacefully,
today I won’t play games
[38:59] instead I’ll pray with my heart
for uncle’s health, you should go.
[39:02] Yes.
[39:03] Yes Rania, don’t worry,
[39:06] you’ll see grandfather will be perfectly fine
and you’ll return happily.
[39:09] If God wills.
[39:11] Who would be taking
care of grandfather?
[39:14] Mother and Bebo lose
all their senses.
[39:17] I’ll get the bags.
Yes
