[00:21] Keep on standing.
[00:23] What would they think about me?
Huh?
[00:25] This old woman exaggerates a lot,
[00:28] and along with that she shows-off.
[00:30] She speaking all this nonsense
to impress us.
[00:32] Keep on standing.
[00:33] Because of you I got insulted
so badly.
[00:36] Sorry mama,
but I feel that
[00:38] I have no fault in all this.
[00:41] Huh?
[00:42] Can you not see straight?
[00:43] The guests were sitting
having breakfast.
[00:45] Couldn’t you have shut up?
[00:47] Mama.
[00:48] You are getting emotional
for no reason.
[00:50] I think those people were
so busy eating
[00:53] that they didn’t even hear uncle talk.
[00:56] You are embarrassed for no reason,
it is fine, let it go.
[00:58] Yes, yes, mama.
[01:00] When those people eating
all their focus was on the food,
[01:03] they didn’t hear anything we said.
[01:05] Yes, mama,
I think the same thing.
[01:09] Okay fine,
[01:10] keep on standing.
[01:16] Are you people speaking the truth?
Huh?
[01:18] Yes, mama.
[01:20] Okay then, sit down.
[01:21] Hey, no mama,
I remembered,
[01:24] when he came and
said if today is Eid,
[01:26] both of them laughed a lot.
[01:29] What? Stand up!
[01:40] Hey, was it the Olympics of exaggeration?
[01:42] The old lady was showing off,
[01:44] we set this table at our home daily.
[01:49] Hey, if we had stayed a little longer,
[01:51] then she would have declared herself
as the family of Mughal-e-Azam.
[01:53] God bless that lost man who came
and revealed her exaggeration
[01:57] or else she was not stopping.
[01:59] Uncle it is really bad,
[02:01] you don’t say these things
about your well-wishers.
[02:03] They have done us so many favours,
do you see that?
[02:05] They took Laiba to the hospital,
taking care of her
[02:07] and inviting us for breakfast today.
It is really bad.
[02:09] Hey, we were sitting
on the breakfast table,
[02:12] like we had gone to get a proposal.
[02:14] By the way, nephew,
[02:15] they seemed like a decent family,
they have liveliness.
[02:19] So find out, apart from that table,
I think all of them booked,
[02:24] if there is someone else
who I can look at and things get set.
[02:28] Something happens.
What are you saying, uncle?
[02:30] Hey, I don’t know who lives there,
and what not?
[02:33] I went there for the first time myself.
I don’t know.
[02:35] Son, find out.
[02:36] If with you I too settle down,
then what is wrong in that? Huh?
[02:42] Okay fine, I will find out.
Okay?
[02:44] How did you like that girl…
[02:47] She was not a girl, she was the wife
of that man who had come.
[02:50] Hey, no, no, not her.
The girl we met outside.
[02:53] The shy one, the pretty one.
[02:54] Rania!
She is a good girl.
[02:57] I will thank her,
since she has done a lot.
[02:59] I am not talking about Rania,
I am talking about the other girl
[03:01] on whose head you refused to
put your hand on. That one. That one.
[03:04] The one that was quiet?
Yes.
[03:05] The one who was sitting mute?
[03:07] Hey, I don’t like such people.
[03:09] Yes, talk about Rania,
she has potential. Work on her.
[03:12] Hey, no Rabail is smarter,
sober and pretty.
[03:15] Smart, sober, pretty,
how do you know?
[03:18] Did you do an Istikhara sitting there?
[03:20] Because I know better than you.
[03:21] Huh?
Yes,
[03:23] I know people, and don’t you dare
praise Rania in front of mama.
[03:26] I am telling you.
It is so surprising,
[03:28] you are putting such a weird
restriction on me
[03:30] It is time for my university,
I am getting late.
[03:31] You go to Laiba at the hospital.
I am going.
[03:33] Hey, have I started a pick and
drop service in this home?
[03:35] I am getting late.
[03:37] Hey, you are getting late,
what am I doing in this home?
[03:40] I will see. One minute,
[03:41] where is my phone?
It is upstairs. I will see.
[03:48] I am going to the hospital.
I will come soon. Don’t worry.
[03:51] You are going to the hospital again?
[03:52] Mama, Laiba is still in the hospital.
[03:55] Now being their neighbours
we have this responsibility
[03:58] that we ask them how they are.
[04:00] How will we go?
Listen, Saman, call Hammad.
[04:03] Say that it is something important.
[04:05] Leave it.
By the time he wakes up,
[04:07] it will be lunch time
instead of breakfast.
[04:09] I am not a child,
I will go myself.
[04:11] And then I will go on uncle’s bike,
I have a license too.
[04:14] Okay, wear a helmet.
[04:16] Okay, goodbye.
Go, safe.
[04:23] Why do you have a long face?
Huh?
[04:26] It feels like I have made you stay here
through a conspiracy and not for your benefit.
[04:32] mama, I was thinking
I will go back home.
[04:35] Listen, don’t get slapped by me.
[04:39] Now it is the matter of my ego,
that’s it.
[04:42] I am the daughter of rich people,
and what do you think,
[04:46] I will give up in front of that up-start?
[04:48] Don’t you dare take another
step without my permission.
[04:53] Mama.
Be quiet.
[05:06] Ifrah is calling?
[05:08] Hello. Yes, Irfah. How are you?
[05:11] I am fine.
[05:12] Where are you? first tell me this.
[05:14] I am going to the university.
You tell me. How is grandma?
[05:16] Grandma didn’t like it at all that
you came to the hospital
[05:19] and went without meeting her.
[05:21] Man, try to understand,
the situation was such.
[05:25] Okay listen, listen, listen,
[05:26] I think sir Zeeshan doesn’t have
his class today,
[05:28] and I think miss Saliya
won’t be here right now.
[05:31] So, I will do one thing, I will come
to the hospital and meet grandma.
[05:34] Fine. come quickly, me and
grandma are waiting for you. Okay?
[05:37] Okay. Okay. I am coming.
I am coming. Bye.
[05:40] Bye.
[05:42] Oh Ifrah, what do I tell you?
[05:44] Your grandma bothers me so much.
[05:46] I have been trying to feed her food
for so long, she is not eating.
[05:49] I don’t know what her issue is.
[05:50] Greetings, how are you people?
[05:52] Greetings.
[05:53] We are fine, you tell me,
how are you?
[05:56] You have come alone?
Where is he?
[06:00] He? Who he?
[06:04] Do you see how naïve she is acting,
[06:05] like she doesn’t know
who I am talking about.
[06:08] Hey I am talking about your hero,
love.
[06:11] He hasn’t come.
Where is he?
[06:13] He is actually in university,
he is just…
[06:16] Okay should I tell you
something interesting?
[06:19] That hero looks just like my ideal.
[06:22] Since childhood, I have been
dreaming of such a prince.
[06:26] Oh. I remember a couplet.
[06:30] Go ahead, ask me to recite it.
[06:31] Recite it. Recite.
[06:33] This is the complaint I have from life.
[06:36] This is the complaint I have from life…
[06:39] it's been a long time since I got it.
[06:51] Hey, you didn’t have to laugh on this,
[06:53] you had to appreciate it. Say wow.
[06:56] Wow. Amazing Wow.
Wow. Wow.
[06:59] You know Rania,
you got saved at my hands.
[07:02] Had I met you earlier,
I would have killed you.
[07:05] Huh? I will go meet Laiba.
[07:09] Yes.
[07:10] Yes. Yes. Go. Go. You know
Laiba is much better now.
[07:14] I forgot, Dr. Wasiq had called me.
I will go.
[07:20] Oh God, I will come.
[07:23] God!
[07:28] Laiba, child,
[07:29] you still haven’t had breakfast?
[07:31] Okay, have a little fruit.
[07:33] Mama, you know I cannot eat
this diet food.
[07:39] I don’t like it here.
I want to go home.
[07:41] Greetings!
[07:44] How are you, now?
[07:45] You know the staff told me that
by the grace of God you are much better. Huh?
[07:49] Yes, she is insisting to go home.
[07:51] Sister Rania, I am getting really bored here,
[07:54] and then this tasteless food.
[07:56] Hah, so I have come to remove
your boredom and see,
[07:59] I got such delicious food
for you people.
[08:02] Rania, what was the need
for this formality?
[08:04] The first thing is that
this is not a formality,
[08:06] being your neighbour
it is my responsibility.
[08:09] Now quickly, go and wash your hands,
we will eat together.
[08:11] You are a really good girl.
Okay fine, I will come.
[08:14] Come on.
[08:31] Oh God, I knew it.
[08:33] I knew it.
[08:34] You would surely come.
You came after her.
[08:36] Hey, I was just…
[08:38] See, our Romeo is also here.
[08:40] What do you mean?
He admitted it?
[08:43] You two are now set?
Amazing man.
[08:45] Hey, hello. What setting?
Have you gone mad?
[08:48] What are you saying?
[08:49] Hey, you say such good things.
[08:52] But I was talking about your Romeo.
[08:57] Hey, Dr. Wasiq had asked me
for this list.
[09:00] I will just come.
[09:02] This staff shouldn’t be
in this hospital,
[09:04] they should be in a mental hospital.
And you?
[09:06] What were you saying?
I have a setting?
[09:08] Are you in your senses?
[09:09] What was I saying?
I was standing quietly.
[09:12] I feel you are hearing things.
Really?
[09:14] I am hearing things?
And this staff,
[09:17] what she said and went,
what did this mean?
[09:20] Dr. Wasiq gave her a file…
[09:21] Okay quiet. I am not stupid,
[09:23] I understand everything
that is happening.
[09:27] Give me the file for bed 24.
[09:33] Sister Anjum?
[09:34] Yes. Yes. Yes, sir?
[09:36] Is there a monkey show outside?
[09:38] No sir.
[09:39] Then what are you trying to peak
at bending your neck?
[09:41] Actually sir, some shows are even
more interesting than a monkey show.
[09:46] And such a show is taking place outside.
[09:49] Huh?
[09:51] But when will you understand these things,
it is a matter of the heart.
[09:57] Your profession is a respectable
profession.
[09:59] And leave this nonseriousness.
[10:01] Understand your profession.
Give me the file.
[10:05] What I am thinking sir has nothing
to do with my profession,
[10:09] it is linked to the heart.
[10:10] And everyone has a heart, sir.
[10:14] Huh!
[10:17] I am adding this medicine
in the file of bed 24.
[10:19] Please check it.
[10:22] It is time for the round
of the private room,
[10:24] and please get serious.
[10:37] Oh God,
[10:40] hey, is it a crime for people from a
respectable profession to smile and laugh?
[10:44] What would doctor Wasiq know
[10:46] how relaxed patients feel
with our frankness.
[10:49] Half their ailment is removed
with our good behaviour.
[10:54] But who will explain this
to this damned Dr. Wasiq.
[11:00] Brother, pack three cups of tea quickly.
[11:08] This is really bad,
[11:11] I cannot eat it.
Ifrah, you?
[11:15] Had I known, I would have brought food
for you along with aunt Anila.
[11:18] Man, actually, mom and
dad are out of country.
[11:22] They will come in a few days,
so I will manage.
[11:25] What do you mean?
You are handling all this alone?
[11:29] Why did you not tell me earlier?
[11:31] Okay, from today, we will take care
of grandma together.
[11:34] I will spend some time with her,
and you spend some time with her.
[11:37] Okay?
[11:38] Rania, you are so good.
[11:41] I have never seen a girl
like you till today.
[11:44] Shall I make you meet aunt?
[11:46] Yes, let me just give tea to aunt Anila,
then we will meet.
[11:48] Quickly.
[11:50] Is the tea ready?
How much money?
[11:53] Hey child,
we are tired of lying here.
[11:55] Tell them to discharge me
and leave me alone.
[11:58] Hey aunty,
[11:59] the doctors will discharge you
when they feel reasonable.
[12:03] You rest. Now tell me,
how are you…
[12:06] Greetings, grandma.
[12:09] How are you?
[12:10] Yes, I am fine, greetings.
[12:12] Grandma, this is Rania.
[12:13] Hey, Rania. This is that girl
who got that child,
[12:16] that stranger’s child to the hospital.
Right?
[12:19] Yes. Yes.
Hey, you give me a hug.
[12:21] She is that girl.
Wow. Wow.
[12:23] Well done, child. Well done.
You did something good.
[12:25] Yes, grandma.
She has a beautiful heart.
[12:28] From today,
she is my best friend.
[12:29] Okay, your best friend is really good.
[12:32] Grandma,
Rania talks well as well.
[12:34] Now you won’t get bored.
[12:35] Yes, I am really bored,
talk about good things.
[12:40] Ifrah, what is wrong with you?
[12:43] You were fine till yesterday,
[12:45] what happened today?
[12:47] Say it. No, no, say it,
she is under my influence.
[12:53] Mahir, Rania is a really good girl,
[12:55] she has also said that
she will solve Salik’s matter.
[12:58] What?
Are you mad?
[13:01] She said it and you believed it?
[13:02] She can only ruin matters,
not solve them.
[13:05] Hey, she does such weird things,
what is wrong with you?
[13:08] Are you challenging me?
[13:10] Me? and I will challenge you?
[13:13] Are you in your senses?
[13:14] You came to fulfil your responsibility
towards the neighbours,
[13:16] so go to their room.
What are you doing here?
[13:18] You be quiet. Ifrah,
you call Salik.
[13:22] Tell Salik to bring all the elders,
I mean the heads of their family here
[13:27] and tell them that his friend’s
grandmother is really unwell.
[13:30] Okay?
[13:32] I will handle the rest.
[13:34] Oh wow, what a great plan.
Too good.
[13:38] You know what she will do now?
[13:39] She will kidnap the elder of their family
and as ransom,
[13:42] she will ask for your proposal
for Salik, right?
[13:45] Stupid plan.
[13:46] Always think negative.
[13:49] Hey, when Salik’s family will come,
[13:52] they will meet our great grandmother
that is when their thinking will change.
[13:56] And then grandma too
will meet them.
[13:57] She will meet them,
they will see her,
[13:59] understand them, then only will
she be able to decide. Right grandma?
[14:01] Yes, the girl has weight
in what she is saying.
[14:03] Then what are you waiting for?
You call Salik.
[14:06] Okay.
[14:12] that’s it.
[14:13] I have had enough of your dramas.
[14:15] This will do nothing.
I am going home.
[14:17] Do you want to come home
with me or not?
[14:19] Hey, how can I go home?
I have a lot of work.
[14:22] Hey two people
I know are hospitalized.
[14:24] I am really busy, you go.
[14:26] Busy?
[14:27] To hell with your busyness.
Fine, then stay here,
[14:30] I am going home.
Grandma, I will leave.
[14:33] Okay child, goodbye.
[14:35] Bye.
[14:36] Do visit at night.
[14:37] We have to show you the achievement
of my smartness as well.
[14:43] Lets see.
[14:46] Tell me more.
[14:48] What more do I tell you?
You tell me.
[14:49] Hello. Salik.
[14:52] Salik, I had to tell you…
[14:59] It was really bitter.
[15:01] Brother, I want to go home.
[15:03] Please you talk to the doctor.
[15:05] I will. It will be done.
[15:07] Hey Farhad,
[15:08] you have come at the right time.
I really needed you.
[15:10] Irfah, take out the money.
[15:11] I will give you money,
go quickly and get sweets.
[15:15] Huh? Sweets? What is the sweet for?
[15:17] There is no labor ward here.
[15:19] it is possible that we need sweets.
[15:21] Her in-laws are coming.
[15:23] Oh, I didn’t introduce her.
This is Irfah.
[15:26] Hello. Hello.
I am Rania’s friend.
[15:29] Hello.
Aunty,
[15:30] pray that things work out,
her wedding is fixed today.
[15:35] Now do you fix proposals
in the hospital as well?
[15:37] Had I known earlier, I would have
got uncle treated here as well.
[15:40] Anyway, you sit,
I will get the sweets.
[15:42] Yes, just bring it quickly.
Okay. Okay
[15:44] Yes, quickly.
Aunty,
[15:45] you have performed ablution, right?
You will pray, right?
[15:47] Just pray extra today,
and pray.
[15:51] It is really important. Come,
we will also tell the rest.
[15:54] Come on.
[15:55] Okay tell me, did you give the patient
on bed 420.
[15:59] Sister Anjum.
Sister Anjum, pray.
[16:02] You people also pray.
[16:03] The prayers of the nurses are answered soon.
We really need prayers right now.
[16:06] Hey, what are you two doing?
Come on.
[16:08] Aunty, you too pray, please.
Pray. All of you pray.
[16:12] All that is fine, but
what are we praying for?
[16:16] He knows…
[16:23] What?
[16:24] What happened?
Why are you praying?
[16:26] Is some patient serious?
Why are you all praying?
[16:28] Doctor, not the patient,
[16:30] the patient’s granddaughter
is in serious condition.
[16:32] We really need prayers.
You too pray.
[16:34] We really need them.
[16:36] Pray. Pray. Go ahead.
Pray. Pray.
[16:42] Ameen.
[16:43] Thank you.
Come on lets go.
[16:49] Sister Anjum, what happened?
[16:50] Something must have surely happened.
[16:58] This Shehanshah is really lazy,
[17:00] he doesn’t do anything properly.
This Rania is totally mad,
[17:03] she also drives everyone else mad.
[17:05] Oh wow,
[17:07] who has driven my brother mad?
[17:10] Rabail, right now I am really angry,
[17:12] don’t joke with me.
[17:14] I think the matter is really serious.
Listen to me,
[17:17] you have to worry and
definitely don’t take any tension.
[17:19] If there is any tension,
you just make one call to Rania,
[17:22] she will fix all your issues.
Rania?
[17:24] Don’t take Rania’s name
in front of me,
[17:26] she is a completely mad girl.
Should I tell you?
[17:30] Wait a minute.
The phone had to ring right now.
[17:32] Hello Rania. Yes, Rania,
go ahead.
[17:35] Oh, okay. Okay okay,
I will tell him. Okay bye.
[17:40] Listen to me, you have forgotten
your phone there in your anger.
[17:46] Argh!
[17:47] Where are you going?
She will bring your phone.
[17:49] She has said she has kept it safe.
[17:50] I have no trust on this girl.
[17:52] Hey, whatever home
such girls go to,
[17:53] they ruin the peace and
comfort of that home.
[17:56] And I feel that her Mian Jee
has sent her here on purpose,
[18:00] that go, go and ruin the peace and
comfort of Mahir’s home completely.
[18:03] What is wrong with you?
I don’t know what sort of things you say.
[18:06] There is nothing like that.
[18:07] It is like that.
I am speaking the truth.
[18:09] Her Mian Jee must dance
there in Khushalpur
[18:11] that thank God he got rid of her.
The problem has been avoided.
[18:14] Listen to me,
you avoid her company.
[18:17] Congratulations.
I got good news.
[18:20] What happened?
[18:21] Did the henna on the feet of
your husband gets removed?
[18:22] Oh, I wish. I am not that lucky.
[18:25] I just came to inform you that
Mona has gotten on the train.
[18:29] Mona has gotten on the train?
Why?
[18:31] To come here, and I am really happy.
What? Is Mona really coming?
[18:35] Yes.
But why?
[18:36] Why not? It is her sister’s home,
she too has a right.
[18:40] Mahir, please go and
get her from the station,
[18:43] she will really like it.
[18:44] But I wont like it at all.
[18:47] Forgive me aunt,
but it is a no from me.
[18:50] Hey, why?
Hey that husband of yours,
[18:54] who is always lying on the bed,
tell him to get her.
[18:57] I have a lot of work to do.
I have a long list.
[18:59] For example?
[19:01] Example.
[19:02] I have a lot of work. I don’t have
time to tell you right now.
[19:04] And I am going, my phone has been
left in the hospital.
[19:06] Make your husband get up.
[19:08] He has lost his mind, and
I know well why he lost his mind.
[19:13] Anyway, Mona is coming.
[19:15] Yes, so what will Mona do?
[19:18] When Mona comes,
she will tell herself what she will do.
[19:29] Rabail, you know
what I am thinking?
[19:31] I will pack my bags.
[19:33] Arbab will be coming to pick me
at any moment.
[19:35] Wow. Wow. Someone is really happy
to go home.
[19:39] Obviously, I am going to my home.
[19:41] It is good. May God always keep you
happy and you go home safely.
[19:45] What are you talking about?
What are you two talking about? Huh?
[19:50] Mama, sister is really happy
[19:52] because brother Arbab will come
to pick her at any moment.
[19:54] Yes, she should go.
She should go. Why not?
[19:57] She should go to her home.
Now I am not stopping you.
[19:59] I got them to agree what we wanted.
[20:01] You were worried for no reason.
Hey, be brave like me.
[20:06] Sure, grandma.
[20:07] and Rabail child,
you too listen to me carefully.
[20:12] Look, you too have to get married,
go to your in-laws,
[20:14] you have to get married too.
[20:17] There is something else,
[20:18] girls don’t get respect being
submissive towards their in-laws.
[20:22] They should stay strong.
[20:25] Listen to me, Saman,
[20:26] in future you don’t have to hesitate,
you don’t have to worry.
[20:29] Yes, grandma.
Stay happy.
[20:32] Yes.
[20:33] You people are not having tea?
Ask for it.
[20:35] I will just ask Shehanshah for it.
[20:37] Shehanshah,
get tea for mama.
[20:40] Oh.
[20:42] Ouch.
[20:43] Ouch.
[20:45] Ouch.
[20:47] Hey, what is wrong?
Where are these people?
[20:50] Why do they have us waiting?
[20:51] Whether they come or not,
I am sleeping.
[21:02] Hey, aunty, come on.
Come on. Come inside.
[21:05] Consider this your own room as well.
Come on. Come on.
[21:09] The boy’s family is not here?
They must be on the way.
[21:11] Grandma, these are our neighbours.
[21:14] This is aunt Anila, and this…
[21:15] This is her son Farhad.
[21:18] Greetings. Greetings.
How are you?
[21:20] I am fine. How are you?
[21:22] How are you feeling?
[21:23] Hey, what do I tell you?
[21:25] So many ailments have surrounded me
in such a young age.
[21:29] Now I am living in the hopes to see
the happiness of this child.
[21:33] This! This is the pain we need,
grandma.
[21:36] You have to speak the same dialogue
in front of Salik’s parents, with the same feel.
[21:41] Full emotional, make everyone cry.
Ditto.
[21:43] Rania. Rania. Rania. Rania.
Some people have come.
[21:47] They were asking for
you on the reception.
[21:49] I feel it is the boy’s family.
[21:53] You know I am so excited,
[21:55] this is the first time an engagement
is taking place in our hospital.
[21:58] I want to get the drum.
[22:06] Oh, my luck.
[22:08] But that Dr. Wasiq,
he is a pain.
[22:12] Hey, grandma, you lie down.
Why are you standing?
[22:15] Quick. Quick. Quick.
Okay. Okay.
[22:16] Create sadness and tension of your face.
see, like this?
[22:20] Yes, like this. Absolutely. And make sounds
in pain. Sounds of pain.
[22:23] Oh. Oh. Oh.
[22:24] Aunty, you too make a sad face,
and sit in this corner.
[22:27] I will do one thing, Rania,
I will also apply a drip.
[22:29] Yes, put the drip.
[22:30] Hey, no, no. No drip.
[22:31] What are you doing? Eat it quickly,
and do one thing, take it,
[22:35] take it to your room.
When I ask for it, bring it then.
[22:37] Quickly. Farhad,
walk quickly. Bye.
[22:40] Have you put the drip?
Oh God, ouch.
[22:44] Listen, give her an injection.
Yes.
[22:46] What is the injection for?
[22:47] It will look like a drama, grandma.
[22:49] Hey, don’t put it in,
I am really scared.
[22:54] Yes, sister.
[22:56] I just..
[22:57] I just wanted to ask that
did I bother you too much?
[23:02] She has a happy
go lucky temperament.
[23:05] Hey brother Anwar,
what are you saying?
[23:08] She is my own daughter.
[23:10] If she bothers me,
I won’t mind it.
[23:12] You know, can I say something?
She is a really good girl.
[23:15] Really respecting.
[23:17] There was no misbehaviour,
she didn’t do any mischief either.
[23:21] You have brought her up well.
[23:23] You just have to do one thing, that you
get her admitted in a university soon.
[23:30] That poor thing went
with this intention.
[23:32] It is her dream and ours too.
[23:34] We will get her admitted.
We will.
[23:36] Once the admissions are open,
we will get her admitted.
[23:39] Why do you worry?
I just wanted to say it.
[23:43] Is everything else fine?
Yes.
[23:45] Goodbye. Goodbye.
Yes. Goodbye. Goodbye.
[23:55] Breathe.
grandma.
[23:58] Breathe.
Grandma.
Yes?
[24:01] Can you breathe?
[24:09] Uncle, aunty,
[24:13] we are thankful to you
that you people came.
[24:16] Hey, Salik told us that
Ifrah’s grandma is unwell.
[24:20] By the way, tell us
what happened to her?
[24:23] What is her ailment?
[24:26] She..uncle..that…
[24:30] if she has one ailment
I will tell you uncle.
[24:34] Now grandma just has one wish.
[24:41] She says that she wants
to see Ifrah get married.
[24:47] She doesn’t want anything else.
[24:49] She is really sad.
[24:51] Sad.
[24:53] By the way,
I don’t see Ifrah’s parents.
[24:57] They went to Dubai for the first time.
[24:59] We thought why bother them?
So we didn’t inform them.
[25:02] First time?
[25:03] We had heard that Ifrah is
from a well-off family.
[25:09] Err..
[25:11] err...
[25:14] yes, they are really rich people.
[25:17] Actually, they go to France
for shopping,
[25:22] so they suddenly got the idea
that they have not been to Dubai,
[25:24] so they went to Dubai.
Oh, I see.
[25:30] You?
[25:31] How are you related to Ifrah?
[25:35] Neighbour.
[25:36] The room next door is ours,
my daughter is admitted.
[25:39] And what are you to them?
[25:42] Me? I am their neighbour.
[25:45] They are all neighbours here.
[25:48] Does she not have anyone
her own here?
[25:53] Alone,
[25:55] lonely,
[25:57] unwell,
[26:00] helpless, poor.
[26:04] Oh.
[26:05] Oh. Oh.
[26:10] You people sit, please.
Come. Sit. Sit. Sit.
[26:13] No child, nothing like that.
We are with her.
[26:17] So sweet aunty.
[26:19] Hey see, Ifrah
and Salik are friends,
[26:22] so it is our responsibility
that we take care of mama.
[26:25] Absolutely.
[26:26] You said something great uncle.
[26:28] Wow.
[26:29] Now if you have a good proposal
for our innocent IFrah,
[26:37] do tell us.
[26:38] The thing is that mama just once…
[26:44] once wants to see her
Ifrah dressed as a bride.
[26:48] The God knows
when she will depart.
[26:50] We are short on time.
[26:52] Yes, yes, child, sure, why not?
I will surely tell you.
[26:55] in fact, Salik has a friend,
what is his name, son?
[26:58] Mahir. Mahir.
Yes, Mahir.
[27:01] He is a really good boy,
if mama asks me,
[27:04] I can get Ifrah wedding fixed there.
[27:08] Aunty, you keep your update to yourself.
[27:16] that..,
[27:18] I…
[27:19] I…
[27:21] I am Mahir’s…
[27:24] fiancee.
[27:29] What?
[27:29] You are Mahir’s fiancée?
[27:32] Yes.
[27:35] Look at that boy,
[27:36] he doesn’t get tired calling me aunt,
[27:39] and he hid something so big from us.
[27:41] I didn’t know he is engaged.
[27:44] Mahir is a little shy and
gets worried easily.
[27:49] So he doesn’t say much.
[27:50] Or else he got after me
and got engaged.
[27:53] Let him come now.
[27:54] You will see I will teach him
a lesson he won’t forget.
[27:57] He hid something so big from me.
[28:02] I will mind it if I stay alive
after making this statement.
[28:07] Mahir will kill me.
[28:19] Papa, don’t let go of this chance
to do a good deed.
[28:23] Return the breaths to a dying patient.
[28:29] Today…
[28:31] Today if you don’t ask for Ifrah’s hand,
[28:36] then I will ask for Ifrah’s hand
for my neighbour’s son.
[28:42] and I can do this.
[28:45] You have one and only son
[28:48] will live his life mourning and
suffering like a failed lover.
[28:56] Child, you don’t understand.
[28:59] This is not my issue.
[29:02] Actually, Salik’s mother is against
marriage based on liking.
[29:09] What?
[29:10] This was the issue?
[29:14] I will have to think of something, man!
[29:25] Where is my daughter?
[29:28] Hey, my child, greetings.
[29:33] Welcome.
[29:35] Hey, are you good?
[29:39] Saman.
[29:40] Why don’t I see you?
[29:42] Because papa she has not come
from mama’s home.
[29:44] God be kind. Did sister
increase her demand?
[29:49] There is nothing like that papa.
[29:50] Then why didn’t she come?
[29:52] Because I didn’t go to get her.
And nor do I plan on going.
[29:56] Hey, don’t talk in riddles.
[29:58] When I don’t know the answer
to a riddle my whole body starts to itch.
[30:02] And I want to scratch the face
of the person in front of me,
[30:05] or I kick the person next to me
and send them out of the room.
[30:08] Don’t talk in riddles.
[30:10] Papa, I want a support in my good
and bad times in form of a wife,
[30:13] what will I do with this worshiper
of wealth? Huh?
[30:15] And the condition they have put for
the property, they have disrespected my love.
[30:18] I won’t go to get her.
[30:19] Here we go, a new issue.
[30:21] Brother Arbab,
sister in law really loves you,
[30:25] in fact, she…
You be quiet,
[30:27] you don’t know anything about
the matters of the heart.
[30:29] Papa, I won’t.
[30:31] Hey, now I will show you my anger.
[30:34] You cannot tolerate the beating
at the hands of my branded sandal.
[30:37] You will go and
get my daughter in law.
[30:39] Hey, this is the question of my,
Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad’s, respect.
[30:46] What will they think,
[30:47] the sister who is proud
of her family’s respect,
[30:51] that I just asked to put a small portion of
the wealth in the name of my daughter in law,
[30:55] and Chaudary Rafiq Ahmad Juman
couldn’t do it.
[30:58] Hey, you will have to go,
[31:00] or you will be a victim of my wrath!
[31:04] Arbab!
[31:09] Arbab!
[31:11] How long have we been here for?
[31:13] She has not come to her
senses even once.
[31:15] Why don’t you take her
to another doctor.
[31:19] Yes, we will,
[31:21] but first this issue should get resolved.
[31:23] What issue?
This.
[31:26] No. No.
[31:30] Will you have juice?
[31:33] No. I…I…
[31:41] Rania, who do I need to feed
the sweets to?
[31:43] You.
[31:44] We need to feed the sweets
to you. Eat.
[31:47] What? The proposal hasn’t been
fixed yet?
[31:51] They are worse than our thinking,
how will we fix the proposal?
[31:56] Do something.
What?
[32:00] Madam, why don’t you understand?
[32:02] Don’t be so stubborn.
[32:04] Salik likes Ifrah and then,
[32:07] we should respect our child’s desire.
[32:11] Ifrah is a good girl,
[32:13] agree to me wife of mine. Agree.
[32:17] Aunty,
[32:18] uncle, I have heard you
two whispering.
[32:23] Aunty,
[32:25] whatever uncle is saying is right.
[32:29] You won’t get a girl like Ifrah anywhere,
I am telling you.
[32:32] Not at all.
[32:34] You know what happens
in a love marriage,
[32:37] if you and I had gotten
married out of love,
[32:39] then till now we would
have been divorced.
[32:44] Here we go,
[32:46] now no learned man has
the cure for superstition.
[32:54] Then, I…
[32:58] I will leave then.
[33:01] I have to go to room 420 to mourn.
[33:05] Why?
What happened there?
[33:07] What do I tell you, uncle?
[33:10] What do I tell you?
[33:14] It is a really sad story,
[33:18] my heart hurts telling it.
[33:23] A boy was admitted there,
[33:26] it must be our Salik’s age.
[33:28] The same laughing, smiling face.
[33:32] He fell in love with an innocent girl
like Ifrah.
[33:38] But his mother was just like aunty.
[33:42] She stood in the way
like the cruel world.
[33:45] She said loves marriages don’t
have happen in our family.
[33:51] Then what?
The wedding got canceled.
[33:53] So what is there to be sad in this?
[33:56] It is something to be sad about.
[33:59] It is something to be sad about, aunty?
[34:01] The thing is the boy got an ailment,
[34:06] the poor thing died.
[34:12] Now you think yourself?
[34:15] Young…
[34:16] the parents are taking the dead body
of their young child,
[34:21] you need to mourn.
[34:23] Of course,
you should mourn.
[34:28] I will leave then, okay?
[34:36] Oh seeing Salik’s face
I remembered,
[34:39] I will get the doctor’s name
and number.
[34:43] God forbid, if you need it tomorrow.
[34:45] You should have all the information,
right uncle?
[34:49] Okay. Fine,
then I will leave now.
[34:54] I…
[34:56] I…
[34:58] I am going.
She is going.
[35:01] You stop her.
[35:02] I am going.
[35:04] She is leaving, I would say take it…
I mean think about it.
[35:08] I am gone.
Wife of mine, stop her. Please.
[35:12] Stop.
[35:17] I don’t want any doctor’s number,
may God give life to my son.
[35:22] Ameen.
Move.
[35:24] I accept Ifrah.
[35:26] Now she will be my Salik’s wife.
[35:30] Congratulations.
Congratulations.
[35:46] Congratulations.
Sweets. Sweets. Sweets.
[35:48] What is this noise?
[35:50] Is some patient in a serious condition?
Move.
[35:52] No, no, sir if you go to this room,
[35:55] then along with the patient’s family,
[35:57] my condition will also become serious.
[35:59] Hey, move out of my way.
Move, let me go.
[36:01] Sir, to go in this room,
[36:03] you will have to cross my dead body.
[36:05] Sister Anjum, what is the drama?
What is this?
[36:07] When I go inside I will know
what is happening inside. Move.
[36:09] Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
Move. Move. I will go and see.
[36:13] Sir. Sir, Dr. Zeeshan is calling you
in the ICU. Come quickly sir.
[36:16] Yes. Yes sir, there is an emergency,
that’s the thing. Go. Yes.
[36:20] Hey, sir come on.
[36:21] What is the problem?
Come on. Come on.
[36:32] Hey, hero.
[36:34] How are you?
[36:36] Hey, you are really lucky that
you got such an amazing fiancée.
[36:50] No. No, uncle no.
[36:53] You will have to eat another Lado.
[36:55] Hey, I have eaten three already.
I cannot have anymore.
[36:58] Hey have the fourth as the last one.
With difficulty.
[37:00] Hey, no you will feed me.
Please. Please, this, last.
[37:03] Hey mama, congratulations to you.
Look at her, she was saying no.
[37:06] Congratulations to you.
[37:08] Congratulations?
[37:09] Hey, you are here?
Open your mouth.
[37:14] What is this?
[37:15] Gulab Jamun.
[37:16] That I know, I am asking
about this drama.
[37:19] This is not a drama,
[37:21] I had told you that
I will set Ifrah and Salik,
[37:25] so their proposal has been finalized.
Congratulations to you too.
[37:30] What is happening?
[37:31] The wedding date?
So soon? Yes.
[37:34] Yay!
It will be fun.
