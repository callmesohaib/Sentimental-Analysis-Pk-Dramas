[00:20] Oh, Mona arrived, welcome,
welcome, welcome.
[00:23] Stop this, leave it,
stop pretending to be happy.
[00:27] Because I texted you an hour ago
to please pick me up,
[00:31] but you did not even respond.
Where is your phone?
[00:34] Do you even know how I got here,
I asked for a lift,
[00:37] and that too, only because
I found up cute boy.
[00:39] But yes the car was
so stinky I can't tell.
[00:43] If my darling Khawar finds out about this,
[00:45] do you know how angry he will be?
[00:47] And if I had texted
my darling Khawar instead,
[00:50] he would've reached there
with so many cars.
[00:52] Mona's, don't be angry, please.
[00:54] Don't be angry actually Mahir
took the car,
[00:58] I texted him about it
but he probably didn't see.
[01:00] I know, when there is only one car
in the house,
[01:03] they have such problems often,
I really don't like it.
[01:06] Thank God,
Khawar has many cars,
[01:09] I won't be stressed about it.
[01:11] Hey, Mona darling.
[01:13] Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[01:15] I had been waiting for you,
good thing you're here.
[01:18] Yes, I was going to come,
[01:19] darling Khawar Insisted so much
that we'll shop when I'll be here.
[01:23] Your choice of dresses,
shoes and a lot more,
[01:26] also he said, whichever expensive dress
you choose I'll bring it to you.
[01:32] By the grace of God,
[01:33] my sister has such a beautiful fate.
[01:36] Yes, no doubt.
[01:39] I was after a stone,
[01:41] but God blessed me with a big diamond.
[01:46] My darling Khawar at one hand,
and useless people on the other.
[01:49] Okay now come on, look at my shopping
then we'll talk about your love.
[01:53] Come on.
Bye.
[01:55] She called me so many names.
[01:58] And you love to interrupt and
talk in everyone's matter,
[02:01] but in my matter,
you didn't say a word.
[02:05] We don't have a love story going on,
[02:07] that you get called names
and I feel hurt.
[02:10] Fight your own wars.
[02:12] You're extremely insensitive.
[02:14] Mother,
[02:18] this time when brother return tells him
to set up a business for me as well.
[02:22] Look at Mona,
[02:23] how she was admiring her husband to be,
what's his name? Khawar.
[02:28] And my wife, your daughter-in-law
gave me a nasty look,
[02:31] I don't know what is going
to happen to me.
[02:33] Whatever happens to you
is not enough.
[02:37] Really?
[02:38] Now go away.
No.
[02:40] I'm watching TV, get away.
[02:41] I made a mistake
[02:42] I should have given Khawar's address
to those robbers.
[02:45] They would have robbed him
of all his money.
[02:47] It would have been fun.
[02:48] You were eager to get out of there,
[02:50] I was going to get
their contact numbers.
[02:53] Yes you should have asked for
the numbers
[02:54] and then should've joined them later.
[02:56] Good idea.
[02:58] You still have a chance, they might have
a page on Instagram, check it and follow them.
[03:01] We will see.
[03:23] Your dress looks really beautiful.
Thank you.
[03:26] I heard brother Mahir brought you the dress.
[03:28] He doesn't even give his fever to someone,
[03:30] and he brought you a dress,
it's a big deal.
[03:33] Is everything okay?
Yes, yes, everything alright.
[03:35] If one of his relatives showed up to
such a grand event in some casual outfits.
[03:39] It would have been embarrassing for him,
only that's why, there is no other reason.
[03:42] Your brother is stingy.
That's why I asked you.
[03:52] Rania, do we have to request you?
[03:55] To please come and spread
the magic of your voice.
[03:58] Me? No, no, I have a sore throat.
[04:00] It wouldn't matter even
if your throat was fine,
[04:04] because you're going
to sing off-key anyway.
[04:09] Okay, okay, come on, come on.
[04:11] No, no, I can't sing,
I don't know how to sing.
[04:15] Come on, it'll be fun.
Dude, I've never sung before.
[04:18] Come on.
Come on Rania, come on Rania.
[04:22] Rania, Rania, Rania,
Rania, Rania.
[04:27] Rania, Rania,
Rania, Rania.
[05:40] Oh wow.
[05:43] Now it’s your turn.
[05:44] Tiger.
[05:46] Okay then,
are you ready team Mahir?
[05:48] 1, 2, 3, go.
[06:08] Do you know everyone is laughing,
talking, singing, dancing,
[06:14] and I am over here alone talking to you.
[06:16] Why are you sitting in the room?
[06:18] You should also go dance, sing,
and enjoy with everyone else.
[06:21] No,
[06:23] you know I don't like anything
without you.
[06:27] What happened?
[06:29] Oh, nothing you just said it with
so much love that It just slipped.
[06:36] Okay, darling,
[06:38] I mean, darling Khawar,
[06:41] I wanted to say that please just bring
just a ring for the ceremony,
[06:46] bring a whole jewellery set.
[06:49] Yes, yes, we will bring a whole jewellery set,
why are you getting worried?
[06:53] Really?
[06:56] There should be a personal car for me.
[06:59] I don't like taking lifts.
[07:02] It is not even something to mention,
just order what you want.
[07:05] Oh really?
[07:08] That's it for now,
[07:09] I haven't seen a man
as beautiful as you.
[07:14] You are really beautiful Khawar,
really pretty, I love you.
[08:14] Mother?
Yes?
[08:15] I wanted to say, it would have been nice if you
had invited Rafique Ahmed and his family as well.
[08:19] Yes we should have invited them as well.
[08:21] Yes, uncle is absolutely right.
[08:23] I am saying that this singing
is continued
[08:27] but call someone funny so
there would be some dance too
[08:31] and we would also enjoy,
right children?
[08:33] Yes.
Call them, invite them.
[08:36] Hello, hello, greetings to everyone
from Anjum.
[08:40] Live long, live long,
Sister Anjum.
[08:42] Rania.
[08:45] Where is Dr. Wasiq,
he didn't come with you?
[08:49] What do I tell you Rania?
[08:50] You know about
that arrogant doctor,
[08:52] he doesn't attend functions like this.
[08:54] He excused.
[08:56] But he promised me
[08:58] that he will attend all the events
and even his father would come.
[09:02] Yes but what can I do
about this Rania?
[09:05] How can he excuse himself
just like that,
[09:07] I will call him right away and ask.
[09:09] You should take a seat.
Yes, yes.
[09:45] Hello?
[09:46] Greetings,
Rania speaking.
[09:48] Greetings,
how are you?
[09:50] However I am,
but are a reneger.
[09:53] You promised me that
you will come, why didn't you?
[09:58] Actually, at the hospital.
[10:02] I asked you to come and
bring your father as well,
[10:06] I was waiting, and you
or your father didn't come.
[10:09] Hello? Hello?
Yes, doctor,
[10:10] you don't have to come,
she is naive,
[10:15] she does not understand that
a person has so many things to do.
[10:17] No, no, no, you shouldn't come,
[10:19] and I'd suggest, don't even pick up
her calls if she calls again.
[10:22] Stay busy, stay busy,
okay bye.
[10:29] Bye.
[10:30] I was talking to him,
what is this behavior?
[10:32] Do you even have self-respect or not?
[10:35] If a person does not want to come
even after you are insisting so much,
[10:39] then let it be, you're pining after him.
[10:41] But I want him and his father to come.
[10:44] Hey?
[10:46] You are not even a little bit ashamed?
[10:47] How you're saying this
in front of me?
[10:51] What's wrong with that?
I am just telling you my wishes.
[10:57] Same thing again,
[10:59] let's go outside,
everyone is waiting for you.
[11:08] This Dr. Wasiq
[11:22] Okay now give it to me,
[11:23] I will show you
how to actually play this.
[11:27] Listen, you are saying this as if I was
banging a box instead of playing the drum.
[11:31] Well that's what it sounded like.
[11:37] Okay, all the girls,
sing with me, okay?
[11:41] And if I don't hear your voice,
look at this,
[11:44] I'll give you an injection as big as this,
understand?
[11:47] Aunt, do you want water?
Yes my child.
[11:51] Well aunt, look at Laiba,
how she's enjoying.
[11:54] Yes.
[11:56] Here you go.
[11:57] Well, it would have been fun
if Farhad and uncle Ayaz were here too.
[12:03] Yes, they were going to come
[12:05] But my father has a land in a village,
[12:07] and there was a problem with it
so they went out of town to solve it.
[12:12] Oh, so when will they return?
[12:15] By tomorrow.
[12:18] Okay, have some water
I'm going to sit with them.
[12:21] Yes.
[12:23] Hello? Hello?
Yes brother.
[12:26] Order for sweets brother,
[12:28] the event has started,
when are you going to deliver?
[12:30] What?
Yes, what?
[12:34] Your child is unwell,
what happened?
[12:36] Oh, stomach,
which hospital?
[12:39] Yes take him there, no problem, no, no,
do your thing first then deliver the sweets.
[12:44] Oh, mother.
[12:46] Hello? Son, what happened?
[12:48] We are having an event here.
[12:50] And these sweets are not in a small amount,
we ordered about 40 kgs,
[12:54] that hasn't arrived yet.
[12:56] Okay I understand your child is sick,
[12:58] ask your wife to take him
to the hospital in a cab
[13:03] and you reach here with the sweets.
[13:06] What?
[13:07] Two hours? How can you?
[13:10] We're waiting for you here, two hours
is a lot of time, arrive right now, yes.
[13:15] Here, that's how you talk,
or they won't come.
[13:22] Mother,
[13:23] 40 kgs of sweets isn't excessive?
[13:27] Oh it's just to show off,
[13:29] who even eats the sweets anymore,
every second person has diabetes.
[13:32] Just, the sweets I ordered,
[13:36] I'll send some to your house and
some to Rafique Ahmed's.
[13:40] Then Rafique Ahmed will do better than
me in their turn after seeing our sweets.
[13:45] And the rest I'll distribute
to the neighborhood,
[13:49] they'll be happy too,
and we can show off as well.
[13:53] Well, what do you like in sweets?
[13:58] I actually don't eat sweets.
[14:00] See, nobody likes nowadays.
[14:02] Everyone has diabetes.
Come on.
[15:40] The grace of God, wow.
[15:43] Mother decorated the house
with delight.
[15:46] Oh, my beloved home.
[15:48] Wow.
[15:51] Thank you brother,
thank you.
[15:54] You arrived so soon?
Well, tell me.
[15:59] Is it a complete 40 kg?
It’s complete.
[16:02] Really good,
[16:03] what were you going to miss
if you had brought 2-3 guys with you?
[16:06] Who's going to pick up
all this now?
[16:09] Well, pick up these two at least,
come on.
[16:11] Come on Dabeer,
go to your mother.
[16:16] And now this one.
[16:19] Hey, Mr. Guest, see
how you arrived just in time.
[16:21] There is sit basket, help us a little,
take it inside with us.
[16:25] I, I, I, I take it inside?
[16:27] Yes, who else? My father will pick it up?
[16:29] You have a long tongue.
[16:31] Well, Mr. Guest, it's not a big deal,
it's just a basket, pick it up.
[16:34] You'll go inside, eat, drink,
and go back to your home.
[16:37] Mother is really angry
because he arrived so early.
[16:41] Come on Mr. Guest, pick it up.
[16:42] Come with him.
Carefully, it's really expensive.
[16:51] Okay, okay, let's meet mother.
[16:55] Even the tea is served but
where is the man with sweets,
[16:58] he’s on his way for the last 30 minutes,
where is he?
[17:00] Call him, it’s too late.
[17:07] Hey, mother, where do I
put this basket of sweets?
[17:10] Put it down,
why are you standing on my head?
[17:15] Mother, won’t you pay labor?
[17:21] Oh, oh, I’m dead.
[17:36] Father, give us some
attention as well.
[17:40] My father returned,
my father has arrived.
[17:43] Mother, when I used to talk to him
on Skype,
[17:46] he seemed so scrawny,
[17:48] look at him now how handsome he is.
[17:52] Isn’t he exactly like how
I was when I was young?
[17:56] Are you kidding?
[18:04] I feel great to meet everyone.
[18:07] Uncle, I’m Rania,
we talked a lot on Skype.
[18:10] Come here, my child.
[18:12] Obviously I recognized, who could
forget a beautiful face like this?
[18:15] Live long, live long.
[18:18] Oh, come on,
let’s have some entertainment.
[18:21] Come on.
[18:23] Who else can play drum
in presence of Dabeer?
[18:27] Oh, Mona.
Greetings.
[18:29] Hey Mona, how are you?
[18:32] Absolutely fine.
Congratulations,
[18:34] live long, live long.
[18:35] Now listen to my drums.
Uncle Dabeer’s.
[18:39] Let’s sit.
[18:41] My skills are famous across the border.
[18:47] Come on everyone,
listen to my father.
[18:49] Place your knee,
place your knee here.
[18:52] Okay so I’m starting, then
we’ll sing loud and good songs.
[18:55] Okay? Ready, 1, 2.
[19:51] Here you go,
that’s how you play it now.
[19:53] I’ll go to my mother now.
Here my king.
[19:58] Come on.
Wow.
[20:00] My mother.
[20:02] I’ll sit on my mother’s feet.
[20:07] Okay, tell me, you did not
bring seety with you?
[20:11] Mother, it’s pronounced sweetie.
[20:14] Whatever, why did you not bring her
with you?
[20:18] Mother I told you,
her legs broke into pieces.
[20:24] She is not allowed
to travel in a plane
[20:27] that’s why I didn’t bring her.
[20:28] But don’t worry,
I’ll introduce you to her.
[20:31] Enjoy the entertainment now.
[20:34] I want to frame and preserve
this delight in my heart forever.
[20:41] Who knows if I ever get to witness
this again or not?
[20:44] Tell me Rania,
you are alright?
[20:46] Father?
[20:47] You’re alright,
let me ask her.
[20:50] She’s pretty.
[20:51] Come on, play it girls,
why are you quiet? Come on.
[20:55] Yes.
[21:09] Mother carefully,
carefully, focus.
[21:12] Come on, Shehenshah son,
go and open the gate.
[21:16] What happened to Rafique Ahmed?
[21:18] Does he need permission
to come to our house?
[21:21] He used to come here every second day,
what happened now.
[21:26] This person, Rafique Ahmed,
he’s a sweet person.
[21:30] Really?
[21:31] And he really respect me a lot.
[21:34] Sure.
[21:35] He is not arrogant at all,
and doesn’t like to show off.
[21:39] Really? That’s good.
[21:41] Greetings, welcome father.
[21:44] Greetings, greetings.
[21:48] Greetings sister.
[21:50] Hey Dabeer. Greetings.
Wow, wow, wow.
[21:56] What happened to you?
Did you all fight before coming here,
[21:59] coming in all separate cars?
[22:00] No sister,
[22:02] but if we have four cars in the house
then why should we only use one?
[22:11] Come on, should we go inside or
do you want red carpet here as well?
[22:14] No, no, sister,
there is no need for that.
[22:17] Actually I do not want to bother you else,
[22:21] the groom’s father does deserve
the red carpet, right?
[22:26] And you didn’t tell us,
such great people are here.
[22:30] American citizen,
[22:32] where he has numerous big stores.
Big reputation.
[22:36] Wow.
[22:38] Why are you humiliating me?
[22:40] Come on, come on.
[22:45] Greetings, brother Khawar.
[22:47] Today you look, not pleasant.
[22:52] You should’ve washed your face
with a nice face wash instead.
[22:56] Oh Khawar,
who are you even listening to.
[23:01] Did you see that?
[23:05] He only wanted to get married to Mona,
[23:07] how he showed his true colors.
[23:09] How he used to act like
a poor soul earlier.
[23:11] Leave it, let it be.
[23:13] What do we have to do with
that if Mona is happy.
[23:14] Why are you acting like a
problematic aunt?
[23:16] Mona?
[23:17] Mona is flying so high in the sky as if she’s
getting married to a prince of a great kingdom.
[23:22] Why are you getting angry over it?
[23:24] Your rich father is also here,
there are showing off their wealth there,
[23:28] you can say the same
about yours here.
[23:31] No Rania,
I don’t have the habit to brag.
[23:34] But I want to take down Khawar.
[23:39] I want to do something to
humiliate him so much
[23:44] that he’d never be able to brag
in front of me out of embarrassment.
[23:46] Let Mona be a part of his life,
he’ll learn his lesson.
[23:49] They’ll all be obeying her orders.
[23:51] Come on, let’s go inside.
[23:59] Mother, what are you saying?
[24:01] We just arrived and
everyone is enjoying right now,
[24:04] I’m not going home.
[24:06] Laiba, aren’t you listening to me?
[24:07] Let’s go home I’m suffocated.
[24:10] What happened aunt?
[24:12] Are you alright?
[24:13] Yes Rania, this shine of money,
[24:17] this display of wealth,
what is all this?
[24:20] See, I don’t have all this for showoff,
[24:23] I won’t be able to do that.
[24:25] Aunt why are you getting worried,
[24:27] I don’t like any of those either.
[24:30] And please don’t take
any of this to your heart,
[24:32] don’t listen to anyone
just enjoy this event.
[24:37] Here you go, your own daughter-in-law
does not like anytime like this,
[24:40] now you shouldn’t be worried at all.
[24:42] But Rania, people will compare.
[24:46] We will find a solution
for that later,
[24:47] but now you should enjoy first,
see how sad is Laiba.
[24:51] Everyone is singing outside,
let’s go and sing,
[24:54] come on, come on.
Aunt come on, please.
[24:56] Just for a little while.
Come on.
[24:58] It’s so entertaining,
I’m seeing after 20 years.
[25:03] Wow.
[25:13] Come and sit here,
with everyone else.
[25:15] Come on, take a seat.
[25:19] Greetings.
Greetings.
[25:20] Greetings sister, how are you?
How is everything at the office?
[25:26] All thanks to God.
[25:28] Well you’re a great woman,
[25:30] in this inflation,
[25:32] I don’t know how you’re managing
the expenses.
[25:41] Uncle, Aunt has an amazing job
and she earns pretty well.
[25:45] Well, grandmother was telling me
[25:46] you used to have a hard time
making ends meet.
[25:50] And just recently got rich.
[25:52] And these people have
generational wealth.
[25:56] What?
[25:57] See, I already had an idea,
[26:00] I knew it was new money.
[26:08] There used to be a custom of
serving tea or beverages at your place,
[26:12] does it not exist anymore?
Are we here to talk only?
[26:15] Oh no, no,
[26:17] why would the customs
not exist anymore?
[26:18] We have a lot of tea,
drink if you want to drink,
[26:22] and dive if you want to dive in it.
[26:26] Yes, and dive with your cars,
you can do more showoff.
[26:29] Tell us, with which car
would you dive first?
[26:32] Brother?
[26:34] Yes, I’ll be back.
[26:39] Mahir and Rania,
I don’t understand
[26:41] why are you always giggling with
your heads close to each other.
[26:44] We have respectable guests,
why are you ignoring them?
[26:47] I will make tea for you brother-in-law.
[26:49] And mother specially ordered
40 kgs of sweets just for you.
[26:54] I’ll go get it.
[26:56] Father,
[26:58] we forgot the sweets,
we came empty-handed,
[27:00] isn’t it embarrassing?
[27:02] You didn’t remind me,
[27:04] well we can’t do anything now.
[27:06] Sit properly you look like a hamster.
[27:58] Sister, where did Dabeer go?
[28:00] He just got here, so he said
he’ll go and freshen up.
[28:06] He’s been wearing the same clothes
since yesterday, the ones he wore on the plane.
[28:09] Okay, then it’s fine.
[28:16] Here you go brother-in-law,
I made it by myself
[28:19] with jaggery, pistachio,
and almond.
[28:23] She never made tea for me
with so much love,
[28:27] money has a lot of power,
[28:30] even the dumbest man
looks good to people.
[28:37] And take the sweets too.
[28:41] Yes, take the sweets,
it’s round like your face.
[28:49] I’ll be back.
[29:09] Sister-in-law Saman.
[29:10] Yes?
[29:11] Why is your sister’s
mother-in-law so quiet?
[29:16] She’s probably feeling inferior
among wealthy people.
[29:22] Listen.
[29:23] Currently, you’re staring at Rabail
and Mona is staring at you.
[29:31] I hope there won’t be blades
that’ll cut both your legs,
[29:37] so I’d suggest, focus on Mona.
[29:40] Instead of Rabail,
[29:42] because you’re happy
with this marriage, right?
[29:54] Yes, yes, Salik dance.
[30:00] Yes, Salik is dancing.
[30:08] Wait a minute,
that’s what you call a dance?
[30:14] This isn’t called dance,
[30:16] you should have flexibility
in your body for dance.
[30:22] Yes.
[30:24] And you should have so much
passion in you
[30:27] that you set that dance floor on fire.
[30:32] Thank you, take a side,
I’ll demonstrate.
[30:41] Sit, watch, and learn.
[30:44] Very good.
[30:46] Dj, please play the song.
[30:49] Me? Dj?
[33:19] Stand here, the enemy of my dignity.
[33:23] You shouldn’t be doing things
you know nothing about.
[33:29] People are saying did you adopt
a monkey’s child.
[33:32] People are jealous of us, father.
[33:34] Currently my brain is also on fire.
[33:37] Do not get smacked by me today.
[33:41] Whenever I plan on gaining respect
or getting appreciation, you ruin it.
[33:48] Hey Shehenshah, come here.
[33:54] Go and tell my drivers
to take away 2 cars,
[33:57] we’ll return in only one.
[33:59] No, instead tell them
to take away all the cars,
[34:03] we’ll return by public transport,
that’s what we deserve.
[34:08] Owl.
