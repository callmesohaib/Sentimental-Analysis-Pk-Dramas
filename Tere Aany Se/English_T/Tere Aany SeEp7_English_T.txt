[00:18] Come on, come in.
Come in. Come in.
[00:22] Shehanshah.
[00:25] Shahenshah.
[00:27] Go call your sir Mahir,
his friends are here.
[00:31] Go. Go. Go. Go.
[00:32] Come on. Come on.
You people come sit comfortably.
[00:36] Right now,
Mahir will wake up,
[00:38] he will take out his branded clothes,
[00:41] get them ironed,
wear them and come.
[00:43] By the way, you are his friends,
[00:45] why don’t you make him understand?
[00:46] Hey, for a friend a friend is dear,
not his branded clothes.
[00:51] Er…
[00:52] you are right, but…
Hi guys, what’s up?
[00:55] Hey you people had come over,
you should have told me earlier.
[00:57] I would have come sooner.
How are you?
[00:59] Buddy, we thought
we would surprise you,
[01:02] but you are dressed up in a way
that maybe you are going somewhere.
[01:07] Hey, this is my swag.
[01:10] I stay this way at home too.
[01:12] With style.
[01:14] What are you doing standing here?
[01:17] We have guests over,
make arrangements for tea for them.
[01:20] Sure.
Go.
[01:22] Who is this girl?
Is she a relative?
[01:23] Relative?
Hey, she is my servant,
[01:26] she works at home.
[01:28] She and my relative?
[01:30] I am not going through such a bad time.
[01:31] Hey, to be my relative,
[01:33] a person should have class,
[01:35] they should have some standard.
[02:11] Greetings aunt.
[02:13] Hello. Rania.
How are you?
[02:17] I am not good.
[02:19] Huh?
[02:20] What happened?
Is everything fine?
[02:23] I am coming back.
[02:25] You people talk,
I am coming.
[02:32] What are you saying?
[02:33] I said I am coming back.
[02:36] Oh man,
I am dead.
[02:37] She will go again and
complain about me.
[02:39] I will get scolded.
How do I convince her?
[02:42] In fact, what is the need
to convince her.
[02:44] She can stay this way.
I am not scared of her.
[02:47] But, what happened?
[02:49] Did someone say something to you?
Did mama scold you?
[02:52] Why would mama scold me?
[02:54] She is really good just like Mian Jee,
[02:56] she really cares for me.
[02:58] Then brother Hamad scold you?
[03:01] Uncle Hamad doesn’t even scold
his little children,
[03:03] how would he scold me?
[03:05] Then what happened?
[03:07] Mama agreed to make you stay
at her home with her happiness.
[03:13] Look Rania,
[03:14] you didn’t go there to spend time.
[03:17] You have such a big objective
in front of you.
[03:20] You have to turn your
dreams into reality.
[03:23] You have to make Mian Jee
raise his head with pride.
[03:27] And if you come back,
[03:29] then you education will remain incomplete.
[03:34] Look Rania,
[03:35] if Mian Jee has to bear your hostel
expense along with the college fees,
[03:41] then he won’t be able to tolerate it.
[03:46] If there is some small worry,
then tolerate it.
[03:50] Tolerate it for your better future.
[03:54] See, what if you have to regret later.
[04:01] Thank you, aunt.
[04:02] You gave me the right advice.
[04:05] I shouldn’t listen to these useless people.
[04:09] I should put my entire focus on
the objective I came here with.
[04:13] I will do that.
[04:15] Well done,
[04:16] that’s what I am talking about.
[04:18] Now you put all your focus
on your education.
[04:21] Okay?
[04:23] And yes, aunt,
[04:25] don’t tell Mian Jee and mama,
[04:27] they will worry for no reason.
[04:28] Yes, yes, don’t worry. Okay?
[04:32] Goodbye.
[04:34] Goodbye.
[04:42] If he called me the relative
of a servant,
[04:44] then why did I get so angry?
[04:47] Is my thinking also changing living here?
[04:51] My Mian Jee says all humans are equal.
[04:55] Being rich and poor is not the measure
to be called respectable.
[05:00] Then why am I talking someone’s
useless comment to my heart.
[05:03] Sorry Mian Jee,
[05:05] I was forgetting what you taught me.
[05:08] But now, I will not make this mistake.
[05:12] Come on, madam prime minister Rania,
[05:15] you are not going anywhere.
[05:16] First you will get an admission here,
[05:18] then you will study with all your heart.
[05:20] You have to fulfil your Mian Jee’s dream.
[05:33] Wow. Wow. Wow.
Wow. Just wow.
[05:36] Nephew.
[05:38] Hey, nephew, congratulations.
[05:40] Today I made food.
[05:43] Hey, poor sister goes to the office,
she comes back tired,
[05:46] then she goes into the kitchen,
so I thought today I will do her a favour.
[05:49] By the way,
cooking is not difficult at all.
[05:53] I have an idea.
[05:55] Eating such food is difficult.
[05:56] I have a request from you,
don’t call me on the dinner table.
[06:01] I cannot praise falsely.
[06:02] You are insulting uncle’s food openly
[06:04] Will you leave me alone?
Don’t bother me,
[06:07] I am already very disturbed.
God be kind,
[06:09] such an unbelievable situation.
[06:11] Wont you share your tension
with your four year elder uncle?
[06:14] Hey, what happened?
[06:17] Uncle, this old woman
in our neighbourhood.
[06:20] Yes?
[06:21] I cannot tell you how stonehearted
and haughty she is.
[06:24] Oh no. Hey, she can be,
why do we care?
[06:27] I care. I…oh…
[06:32] I went to their home
[06:33] and I guess they didn’t like me at all.
[06:36] Son, I don’t understand what tone
I should use with you.
[06:39] Okay, I agree that
you are ordinary.
[06:42] Such people exist,
learn to manage in this,
[06:45] don’t learn to be arrogant.
You are being arrogant
[06:47] and going there you are suffering
from inferiority complex.
[06:49] Confirm. It is confirmed that you have been
suffering from an inferiority complex.
[06:51] Hey, it is not about inferiority complex.
You don’t get it.
[06:54] I mean all this happened
because of my family.
[06:57] I went there, and I don’t know
about my family background.
[06:59] What do we do? What not?
What is my family tree?
[07:02] I cannot tell you, how insulted I felt.
What would you have done?
[07:05] We had invested in crypto.
Hey, to hell with crypto.
[07:08] It is the fault of you two,
no one else.
[07:11] I smell something burning.
[07:12] I think the dish is burning.
If it gets burned a lot,
[07:14] I wont leave you.
I am telling you.
[07:22] What will happen?
[07:25] What is the matter Saman?
Why the long face?
[07:28] You always look worried.
[07:32] Mama, I feel that Babar and
uncle Rafiq wont listen to us.
[07:35] For them the wealth is more important
than their daughter in law.
[07:38] Not just property, they wont even
put a few hundred thousand in my name.
[07:41] Then fine,
[07:42] Saman too doesn’t have
to go back grandma.
[07:45] Huh?
[07:45] My sister is not that worthless for me.
[07:48] They took me really lightly.
[07:52] It is time to show them my true colours.
[07:55] I will see now.
[07:56] Oh
Mama.
[07:58] Mama..
Yes, child?
[08:00] Where did she come from?
[08:03] Mama. I want to talk to you
about something.
[08:05] Yes, go ahead child.
What do you want to say.
[08:07] Now she will surely talk about leaving,
[08:10] and she will exaggerate and tell mama
the reason for her leaving.
[08:13] I….
I…I will tell you grandma.
[08:17] Actually, she wants to go back
to her home
[08:21] and she will make the excuse
that I didn’t give her my respect,
[08:23] I mean I didn’t give her respect
and importance.
[08:27] However, the actual reason
is something else.
[08:29] She came here because
her parents forced her.
[08:32] Hey, this studying, and advanced studies
is not her cup of tea.
[08:36] Now she is giving up and
wants to go back.
[08:38] So leave, who is stopping you?
[08:40] What has happened to him?
What is he saying?
[08:45] I don’t know what stories
he is telling you.
[08:46] There is nothing like that.
[08:48] I came to ask you
what I should get cooked today,
[08:51] and look at him what nonsense
is he speaking.
[08:54] I feel he has really lost his mind.
[08:58] Child, he is joking.
[09:00] He does this, you know.
[09:02] He takes up after his grandfather.
[09:05] Yes.
[09:07] Okay tell me,
what did you want to ask?
[09:09] I was asking about food.
What do I get cooked?
[09:11] Hey, get whatever you want cooked.
[09:13] Just make sure there is rice.
[09:15] Fine. Once Shehansha comes,
I will inform him.
[09:18] Yes, yes, okay.
[09:35] Hey, hey, let me stop.
[09:38] There are some etiquettes,
some manners. My game…
[09:41] You stop, don’t give me a lecture.
Listen to me.
[09:48] On the face of it there is no issue
between Rania and Mahir,
[09:52] but they are always taunting
each other.
[09:55] Even as an argument, but
they are engaged with each other.
[09:59] They keep on taunting each other.
[10:02] So let it be,
now should I become a referee
[10:05] and find a middle ground?
[10:06] You cannot be a referee,
Mr. Hamad,
[10:09] in that you have to move
your hands and feet.
[10:11] When will you work so hard?
[10:12] Listen to me, this fighting
is not a good sign,
[10:16] it is pointing at something else.
[10:18] What do you mean?
First firsts,
[10:21] then small arguments,
then love.
[10:24] This is what I have seen
in films and dramas.
[10:27] And if Mahir and Rania fall in love,
[10:29] then what will happen to my Mona?
[10:36] Did you fall from the stairs
in childhood?
[10:40] No. Why?
[10:41] Because a person loses their mind
falling from the stairs.
[10:46] I too have seen it in films.
[10:53] Give back my phone.
[10:56] Make your own tea,
and also make it for me.
[11:10] Sister, I have added the coriander, now?
[11:13] Now mix it well.
[11:21] Yes, sister, I have mixed it now.
[11:24] Now leave it alone. Go, get the rice.
[11:28] Mama has said that we will also have
rice for dinner. Come on, go.
[11:31] Okay, I will bring it.
[11:48] You were really giving messages
on the phone,
[11:50] that I will not stay here any longer,
I am coming back.
[11:54] Why didn’t you leave?
[11:57] Why do you care?
[11:59] I know well.
[12:00] You will leave all these luxuries and
comfort and go to that village of yours?
[12:06] It is not possible.
[12:07] All these are your attention
seeking tactics.
[12:10] I know it all.
[12:14] Really wrong thinking.
[12:17] The real thing is that
[12:20] my determination is stronger
than the mountains,
[12:23] and I didn’t see these dreams that
I open my eyes and they break.
[12:28] I have to fulfil my dreams.
[12:31] And the most important thing for
this is that I make myself strong,
[12:35] and ignore everything any
useless person says. Understand?
[12:40] What happened, Rania?
What happened?
[12:42] What happened?
Show me?
[12:43] Where did you burn yourself?
Hey, where? This hand.
[12:46] Where did it get burned?
Man, this looks bad.
[12:48] My hand.
You?
[12:50] hey, you close your mouth.
Go and get some medication.
[12:53] Her hand caught fire.
[12:54] There is no fire, I will bring it.
[12:56] It got burned a little.
[12:58] Show me. Show me.
Lets pour water. Lets pour water.
[13:00] It hurts a lot.
Lets pour water and see if it hurts.
[13:03] There is no water.
[13:04] Where did your injury go?
Where is the injury? Where is it?
[13:07] Here you go.
[13:09] Why are you giving it to me?
Apply it on her hand.
[13:11] I felt the way the condition is,
you would want to apply it yourself.
[13:13] Hey, why would I apply it?
I am no compounder.
[13:15] Hey, show me your hand.
[13:16] Where does it hurt?
I don’t see the injury.
[13:18] Are you blind?
[13:20] Hey, nothing happened.
You are just acting up.
[13:22] Hey, why would I act up?
[13:24] The blind man cannot see my injury.
[13:27] You must have been so lost
in talking that you didn’t see.
[13:30] Yes, maybe.
[13:32] Where is it? There is no mark.
[13:35] The whole hand.
[13:37] Your whole family has brought you up
with a lot of love,
[13:40] or else you get these small wounds.
[13:44] It is not small, had you gotten it,
you would have known.
[13:52] Oh Mian Jee.
[14:12] Your tea.
[14:15] Hey, man, man, man,
[14:16] what are you doing? Were you
about to commit suicide?
[14:18] Are you mad?
[14:20] I will commit suicide jumping
in the swimming pool?
[14:22] Is this a lake?
[14:24] Here you go son.
[14:27] What is this?
[14:27] Son, these are the papers
of the home.
[14:29] Why are you giving this to me?
[14:31] I have put this home
in Saman’s name.
[14:34] Now you show these papers to sister,
[14:37] and bring back Saman.
[14:39] Not at all. I will never do that.
[14:41] I will never agree to
this condition of their’s.
[14:43] Papa, relations are formed on
the basis of love and affection.
[14:47] Relations formed on the basis
of greed are not relations.
[14:50] And if Saman doesn’t care about
our love and affection,
[14:53] then she can stay at her parents’ home.
Son, don’t be stubborn.
[14:56] Sort the matter that can be sorted.
[14:59] You are seeing after she left this home
is no longer a home.
[15:04] Neither the three of us are the same.
[15:06] We go around hiding out faces from
each other, tired, silent, lie in a corner.
[15:11] Especially you.
[15:13] Seeing you I am reminded of a lazy
venomous snake lying in the cold weather.
[15:20] He doesn’t even want to sting anyone.
[15:24] When she comes you will come back
to life as well.
[15:26] You know, papa, couldn’t you have given
the example of a sad nightingale?
[15:29] Son, the nightingale wouldn’t have liked it.
[15:31] Hah,
[15:32] papa, the real thing is left in the middle
[15:34] Nothing is left in the middle.
[15:37] This is the test of her love.
[15:38] If she truly loves me,
[15:40] then she will come back to this home without
getting any of her conditions approved.
[15:44] After all, the snake has some respect.
[15:49] Papa, I think brother didn’t like
what you said.
[15:51] No son, he is being stubborn.
[15:54] If we look at it, it is not that wrong.
[15:58] But if two people come
at a dead lock,
[16:01] then one of them has to bend
[16:06] or else it doesn’t take relations
to get over.
[16:14] This means,
I will have to do something.
[16:18] Not this, bring the other homeo tube,
it is really good for burns.
[16:23] Homeo?
I will go and check inside.
[16:25] No, not at all.
[16:26] These tubes from the city
wont work. Mama!
[16:29] I feel I got the evil eye,
it is burning a lot.
[16:34] Stop this drama.
[16:36] You act like you are really
delicate for no reason.
[16:38] Nothing happened to you.
[16:39] Grandma, even I got worried at first,
then I checked myself.
[16:43] Hey she didn’t even get a scratch.
[16:45] What are you saying?
[16:47] Is this even something
you should say?
[16:48] My daughter doesn’t create
a scene for no reason.
[16:51] I think that some injuries cannot
be seen on the outside.
[16:54] We will have to take her
to the doctor.
[16:57] You do one thing, take out
the car and take her.
[16:59] What?
[17:01] Hey, grandma, there is no need
to take her to the doctor.
[17:04] She got such a small injury.
[17:05] Yes, so even my daughter
is like a flower.
[17:08] Look, you take her to the doctor
[17:10] and then after you get the medication
prescribed, go feed her something.
[17:14] The Dahi Balay of Lahore,
[17:17] and then the butter milk along with it.
[17:19] After you feed her, do take her
out somewhere too.
[17:22] Since she has come,
[17:24] the poor thing has been locked up in
the home. You take her for an outing.
[17:26] Butter milk?
Yes.
[17:28] Dahi ballay?
Yes.
[17:30] Grandma, before all this, the doctor
will admit me in the mental hospital.
[17:34] I will be insulted.
[17:35] Ouch,
[17:36] the burning has spread
in the entire arm, mama.
[17:39] It hurts a lot. Oh,
I am dead. Oh.
[17:43] We don’t even have the tube.
[17:45] Oh, then we will have to go. Come on,
take out the car, take her along.
[17:49] Yes, come on, come.
[17:50] What if you die cause of the pain?
[17:52] Yes. Come on. Come on.
[17:53] See. Did you see grandma. Did you see?
She is fine, she is acting.
[17:55] Oh…
Hey, she is acting.
[17:57] I feel dizzy.
Come on.
[18:00] Should I get a wheel chair for you?
[18:03] Where is he taking the girl
holding her like that?
[18:05] Rania burned her hand so much,
[18:07] brother Mahir took her
to the doctor.
[18:09] So much? How much?
It was a minor injury.
[18:12] We even applied your tube,
then why is he taking her to the doctor?
[18:15] I have sent her, now speak!
[18:21] Why is aunt so angry?
[18:23] She is jealous.
[18:26] Yes, I will go get the tube
from her.
[18:34] Doctor.
Yes, I will talk to you.
[18:37] How are you Mahir?
[18:39] I am fine, doctor.
I am good.
[18:42] This is my cousin, Rania,
she burned her hand, check it.
[18:45] Show me the hand that got burned.
[18:47] This is the hand. It hurts a lot, doctor.
[18:50] Hey she has the lifestyle of a princess,
doctor.
[18:53] The family really cares for her,
they never made her do any work.
[18:58] You see, try searching with
a magnifying glass.
[19:00] Who knows, you might find a
small wound somewhere. See.
[19:03] You know, who has so many
people to care for her,
[19:06] she will throw tantrums.
[19:07] Experience, doctor.
A lot of experience.
[19:10] You know, I can count
the wings of a bird.
[19:17] Fine, if you have checked her,
then can we go now?
[19:20] Hey,
[19:21] he has more pain on his face,
than her.
[19:24] What do you say, doctor?
[19:26] Absolutely.
[19:28] Come on. Thank you.
Thank you doctor.
[19:29] Hey wait,
[19:31] She has no special
or ordinary wound.
[19:34] I think she got scared.
[19:36] Make her have juice,
feed her curry,
[19:40] so that she can become
a little healthy.
[19:41] Take her out so that
she gets fresh.
[19:44] Thank you doctor,
you are really good.
[19:46] Thank you.
Fine, thank you.
[19:49] Here you go.
Thank you. Come on.
[19:52] Yes, come on.
[19:53] Get up.
We have to eat a lot as well.
[19:55] Absolutely.
Thank you. Goodbye.
[19:57] Goodbye.
[19:59] Seeing them reminds me
of my college days,
[20:03] the whole college used to be
after me like this.
[20:05] Me too.
[20:14] This place is so lively.
[20:17] I think there is custom of sitting
at home in this city.
[20:20] It feels like the whole city
is on the road.
[20:23] Fine. Fine.
[20:24] We have come to have juice.
Quickly drink juice
[20:26] so that you come to your senses,
and come on.
[20:29] No. No. I just won’t have juice.
[20:31] Did you not hear
what the doctor said?
[20:32] I have a bad injury,
you should keep me happy.
[20:36] You know, my mind especially comes
into place by eating gol gappay.
[20:40] Where did you get me caught?
[20:42] What is there to be caught in this?
[20:44] I didn’t ask you to get something
from the moon.
[20:46] We have come to the restaurant,
you need to order, pay the money,
[20:48] you don’t have to make
anything yourself.
[20:50] Okay fine. Fine.
Order. Come on, now.
[20:52] Shall we go upstairs?
[21:11] What is wrong?
Why don’t you sit comfortably?
[21:14] Where are they?
[21:16] I had told you aunt,
they went to the doctor.
[21:18] You go to the doctor for a reason.
[21:20] This is a chill program.
[21:22] Listen to her,
[21:23] does anyone go
to the doctor to chill?
[21:26] I had told you,
I had sent them.
[21:29] It has been so long...
Aren’t they late?
[21:32] Even if they are late,
why do you have a problem?
[21:34] Go sit with your useless husband.
[21:36] You are taunting me like I got the useless,
stupid and lazy husband here from my home.
[21:41] Hey…
Hey grandma, so much anger.
So much tension?
[21:45] You know, because of anger and tension,
you get wrinkles on your face.
[21:51] I have no tension, no anger.
[21:55] I was bored,
[21:56] I thought that when we all gather
we will have fun.
[21:59] Now you have had fun, now, come on, go.
Go, get your children to do their homework.
[22:06] Okay mama.
[22:08] She is a weird woman.
[22:09] She is worried about
Mahir and Rania.
[22:13] She is getting slim in its sorrow.
Nothing else.
[22:17] I already had few peanuts,
and now half of them are burnt.
[22:26] it is really delicious.
[22:28] I wish Babo and mama were here.
[22:30] Bebo and mama really
like gol gappay.
[22:33] Oh we should have got
Rabail along with us.
[22:35] Had she come, she would have
had so much fun, right?
[22:41] It is really delicious.
[22:50] You too eat.
[22:51] Don’t look at me like this,
[22:53] what if I get a stomach home
after getting home.
[23:04] Hey, hello. Hello. Hello.
I asked you to eat,
[23:07] I didn’t ask you to eat
from my plate.
[23:09] Order for yourself
if you want to eat it,
[23:10] I don’t share food.
[23:13] When was I eating it.
[23:15] After all, I don’t eat this nonsense.
[23:17] And eat with some manners, decently.
[23:19] Everyone is looking at our table.
[23:22] If someone I know sees me,
then what will they think about me,
[23:26] that what ill-mannered person
am I sitting with and eating.
[23:29] Really?
[23:30] So what is the big deal in that?
[23:32] Say that she is the cousin of your servant.
[23:34] Servant’s cousin?
[23:36] And I am sitting here with my servant’s
cousin and eating food?
[23:40] I have made my respect
with a lot of difficulty.
[23:43] For God’s sake, please, for…
[23:47] There is no point.
[23:49] There is no point trying
to make you understand.
[23:51] Spicy.
[23:52] It is really spicy. One second,
give this to me.
[23:56] If it is really spicy, then should I order
two to three tanks of water, drink them.
[24:00] Just order one more of this.
[24:07] Waiter.
[24:16] Have breakfast properly,
what armies are after you?
[24:20] Hey, grandma it is just fine.
[24:21] I have to go to the university,
I am getting late.
[24:23] I will have it later.
Okay, I am done.
[24:25] Clean your plate and go.
[24:27] okay, bye.
Bye. Bye brother Mahir.
[24:30] Bye. Goodbye.
[24:33] What is wrong?
[24:34] have breakfast or you will get
slapped before going to school.
[24:37] Mama, even brother Mahir went
without having breakfast,
[24:40] no one said anything to him.
[24:42] Because no one stopped him as a child.
[24:44] If he was slapped as a child,
[24:46] I would have seen how he would have
gone without eating his breakfast.
[24:48] You said the right thing, aunt.
[24:52] I always say the right thing,
[24:55] if someone agrees then.
[24:56] Anyway, leave me, tell me,
did you enjoy with Mahir?
[24:59] What did you do? What did you eat?
Where did you go?
[25:01] Hey, we ate a lot.
We had dahi ballay,
[25:04] we even had butter milk, it is delicious,
you people should have it too.
[25:07] We also had gol gappay.
[25:09] Rabail, you should have come along,
[25:10] I really missed you.
it would have been a lot of fun.
[25:14] My son is so caring,
he doesn’t let anyone get bored.
[25:20] Who are you talking about?
[25:21] Mahir, who else?
He is so easy going.
[25:25] Really? I don’t know,
[25:27] maybe he laughs seeing himself
in the mirror.
[25:29] He is always annoyed usually.
[25:33] Come on, finish the breakfast,
why are you people taking so long?
[25:36] Don’t the children have to go to school?
[25:40] Yes, this.
Cheating.
[25:43] I am not cheating.
This is confirmed cheating.
[25:45] No. I am not cheating at all.
Here you go.
[25:47] Ayaz, if you get free from this important work,
then listen to me too.
[25:51] Sister, I am listening.
I am listening.
[25:53] I have a colleague, Nazia.
[25:55] What? Has she become a widow?
[25:56] Or did her husband divorce her?,
[25:58] Hey damn you, listen to me completely.
[26:00] Go ahead.
[26:01] Hey, she has an elder sister,
she didn’t get along with her husband,
[26:03] they got separated three years back.
[26:05] Okay, I am thinking
I will send your proposal.
[26:08] Why ask before doing something good.
Sister, go ahead.
[26:11] Okay, but what do I say?
[26:13] That my brother considers these
ordinary jobs as per his standard
[26:17] and he plans to do big businesses.
[26:19] He doesn’t have a penny in his pocket,
so all the plans are left incomplete.
[26:22] What good news did I want to give you?
[26:23] I wanted to tell you that
I am thinking of finding a job.
[26:26] Yes.
[26:28] Oh thank God, you thought
of something good.
[26:30] So sister, I am applying
for the jobs today.
[26:32] I have some multinationals
in my mind by the way.
[26:35] You talk about that marriage.
[26:37] Just pray that those people agree,
they don’t say no looking at you.
[26:40] What do I lack?
You lack sense.
[26:43] Okay.
[26:44] Mama,
[26:46] by the way what are you doing
in the evening?
[26:48] Pay the neighbours a visit.
Why is that?
[26:51] Hey, you got angry.
I was just saying it.
[26:52] Even neighbours have rights,
you should meet them.
[26:56] I don’t have spare time like you people,
understand?
[27:01] Shehanshah.
Shehanshah.
[27:03] Mama has been calling you for so long.
You are sitting here. Go.
[27:05] First listen to me.
Do what I am saying.
[27:07] Take this shirt, and go iron it.
Quickly. Quickly.
[27:09] Give me the shirt, I will do it.
You go. Go. Go. Go.
[27:10] What are you doing?
I asked you to do something and you…
[27:12] Return my shirt.
[27:14] You know how expensive it is?
[27:15] You don’t have manners
to do anything right.
[27:17] If my shirt gets burned,
it will be a big loss. Return it.
[27:21] You know,
I iron clothes well,
[27:23] it is up to you. If you don’t want it,
then do it yourself.
[27:26] I do it myself?
[27:27] There are so many servants
in the home,
[27:29] what do I pay them for?
[27:31] Me? Hello.
[27:33] Who are you showing off
in front of?
[27:35] Listen to me,
[27:36] it's easy to be arrogant
on your father’s earning.
[27:39] It is only good if a person
does things himself.
[27:42] After all,
[27:43] I have heard, that an arrogant mother
also lives with papa abroad.
[27:48] If mama tells papa not
to send you money one day,
[27:52] then what will happen to you?
[27:55] In defence…
I know. I know.
[27:57] you have a lot of property,
[27:58] but that too belongs
to your papa. Right?
[28:01] What do you own?
[28:03] For no reason.
[28:04] Hey, someone also teach us
to show off for no reason.
[28:08] I don’t know how people
show off like this.
[28:10] You know, this is a talent
I will have to learn it.
[28:13] To show off a person
should have a quality.
[28:16] If you show off,
people will consider you mad.
[28:20] Really?
What quality do you have?
[28:23] Quality?
[28:24] I have qualities.
[28:26] Go ask the girls in my university.
[28:28] Girls die for me.
[28:30] They must not be girls,
they must be goats.
[28:33] It is useless to talk to you.
[28:38] He looks okay,
he is good at heart too,
[28:42] girls might die after him.
[28:44] His pride stops me from
speaking the truth.
[28:51] Come on, come quickly.
Sister, let me play a little longer.
[28:53] Your mama is really angry,
even if two minutes… Hello.
[28:57] Hi.
[28:58] I was waiting for you.
Why?
[29:00] Do you need anything else now?
[29:01] It is not necessary that a person will
only come for tea leaf and salt.
[29:04] I came to ask when
you are coming to our home?
[29:08] No, no, we have everything
present at our home,
[29:10] so we don’t need to go to anyone’s home,
to ask for anything.
[29:14] You are insulting me badly.
[29:16] I was asking when you would
come to our home,
[29:19] to meet my mama,
to meet my sister,
[29:22] speak up.
When will you come?
[29:25] Wow,
[29:26] you suddenly became
so informal from being formal.
[29:28] Why?
[29:30] Didn’t you like it?
[29:35] Tell me honestly.
[29:51] Come on.
Greet mama from me.
[29:53] Are you mad?
[29:54] if I greet mama then she will ask me
a hundred questions.
[29:56] Who is it? Where did you meet him?
What did you talk about?
[29:58] How will I answer for
so many questions?
[30:01] Oh,
[30:02] so this means,
[30:03] I will have to come to your home
to greet her.
[30:05] Yes, maybe.
[30:10] Okay fine,
[30:12] we will meet again this way.
[30:21] What did you think of suddenly?
[30:23] Hey, grandma, whether I remember it
while sitting or standing,
[30:27] it is right, right?
You think yourself,
[30:29] there his second wife
is having a good time.
[30:32] And here, papa just sends us
a few dollars
[30:34] and gets rid of all his responsibilities.
[30:37] Grandma, that’s it,
it is enough.
[30:38] Now it won’t happen.
You talk to papa
[30:41] and ask him to increase
the amount of dollars
[30:43] and put this property in my name.
[30:47] Hey son,
you are your father’s only son,
[30:50] it all belongs to you.
[30:52] Hey, is belongs to her
for no reason?
[30:54] And that poor other mother,
does she not have a right?
[30:57] No, this will be a big mistreatment,
mama.
[31:00] He is my father, our property,
[31:03] who are you to interfere?
[31:05] Who am I? I am bearer of justice.
[31:08] And I will not let that innocent girl
get mistreated, mama.
[31:12] Such greedy sons, God forbid,
[31:14] you don’t give wealth to such sons,
you disown them.
[31:18] And be afraid of the time, when I put
all the of you in a corner.
[31:23] Grandma, I am talking to you about
something so important and she…
[31:25] That thing is over,
I have told you,
[31:27] I will not that oppressed
woman gets mistreated.
[31:30] She has a full right on the wealth.
[31:32] Grandma, make her shut up.
[31:34] I am telling you,
make her shut up.
[31:36] Go from here,
don’t drive me mad. Go.
[31:37] Okay, here you go, then.
[31:41] Grandma, we will talk about
our home privately.
[31:45] I don’t know what has happened
to him suddenly, huh?
[31:49] He has me worried.
[31:51] I don’t know who put
all this in his head.
[32:02] Here you go.
[32:08] What happened?
What are you thinking?
[32:10] Did you not talk to brother Arbab?
[32:12] Rabail, Arbab didn’t even call me.
[32:15] Oh, why? Maybe he is upset.
[32:19] He is surely upset.
[32:20] I just asked a small share
in the property,
[32:23] he is not talking to me.
He got so upset.
[32:27] So you give up this wish.
[32:29] I will not give up this wish
even when I die.
[32:32] I know his reality.
[32:34] He only loves his wealth.
[32:37] I have no importance in his eyes.
[32:39] Hey, if you know his reality,
everything is clear in front of you,
[32:42] then why are you getting tired
thinking about everything?
[32:44] To hell with it.
[32:45] Do I want to stay sad?
To miss him?
[32:48] But when I remember that
he only loves his wealth,
[32:51] he doesn’t care about me at all.
[32:53] My heart hurts.
[32:56] I get really sad,
I don’t like it at all.
[33:02] Don’t be sad,
come here.
[33:04] Keep my cup too.
[33:06] Come here. Come here.
Come here to me.
[33:10] My lovely sister.
[33:14] Write well, such bad handwriting,
[33:17] you will get beaten. Come on,
write it this small. Understand?
[33:21] Wow, you are studying hard.
Good.
[33:25] Come on,
go write it there.
[33:28] You people have to come first,
hear me out.
[33:33] By the way, Rania,
I was thinking,
[33:34] you are always mentioning Mian Jee,
[33:37] but you never talk about
your father. Why?
[33:40] I was really young,
when papa passed away.
[33:43] How young?
[33:44] I don’t know,
[33:46] I wasn’t even in my senses,
so I don’t remember anything.
[33:49] Okay,
[33:50] so did you not ask Mian Jee
about your papa.
[33:52] I have. I have asked him
many times.
[33:54] But, this mention makes him sad,
so he doesn’t talk much.
[34:00] All of you are here, huh?
Come, mama. Come. Have a seat,
[34:03] see the weather is so good.
Yes, that is why I came to the lawn too.
[34:07] You did good.
Yes.
[34:10] Mama, aunt was asking how young
was I when papa passed away.
[34:15] You must remember,
how old was I?
[34:18] Child, what has passed,
has passed.
[34:20] now you are Mian Jee’s daughter,
[34:23] and my brother has worked
really hard on you.
[34:26] He left nothing unattended.
Now you too have to make him proud.
[34:31] Without a doubt. Without a doubt.
[34:33] By the way,
what did Rania’s father do?
[34:36] He was an educated,
young man.
[34:38] He lived and earned well.
[34:40] Really? No one ever told me this.
[34:43] What had papa studied?
[34:45] Hey child, what old things are
you people talking about.
[34:48] I came to say that also care
about Saman,
[34:51] she keeps sitting alone,
she gets disappointed,
[34:53] talk to her, have fun with her,
divert her attention.
[34:59] Mama, how do we divert her attention,
[35:01] we have our own issues.
[35:03] If you listen to me, send her.
[35:05] Give up on your conditions.
If it takes long, we will be at loss.
[35:09] You mean that I being really rich,
[35:13] give up in front of that upstart?
[35:16] I take back my conditions and
send Saman back to her in-laws?
[35:19] Mama, this was my small opinion.
[35:22] You have to do
what you think is right.
[35:24] I will tell you this, that,
[35:26] that upstart is much richer than us.
[35:29] Listen to me,
[35:30] us rich people are not impressed
by these things.
[35:36] To hell with it. Bloody miser.
[35:50] I found out about this today,
[35:52] that my papa was a really educated man.
[35:59] I am surprised, no one ever told me this.
[36:03] I am the daughter of such a capable man.
[36:07] I should know everything about my papa.
[36:10] When I go home this time, I will ask
Mian Jee about everything.
[36:14] I will ask him everything.
[36:16] How was he?
What did he think about me?
[36:19] He must love me a lot.
[36:23] I wish.
[36:25] I wish he was alive today.
