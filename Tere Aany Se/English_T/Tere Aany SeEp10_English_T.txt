[00:45] Yes, Mona.
[00:49] No need to worry about anything, child.
[00:51] You get all sorts vehicles for hire
outside the Lahore station.
[00:56] Hire anything and come over.
[01:01] The engine has failed.
[01:03] It will take more time?
That is good.
[01:06] No, I mean nothing to worry about, child.
[01:11] The train is parked in the jungle?
[01:13] Then enjoy the jungle, child.
Come on.
[01:15] Okay. Okay. We will talk again.
[01:19] The train engine has failed,
so the train will reach in the morning.
[01:25] Okay, did I have food?
[01:30] Yes, I did. I am going to sleep now.
[01:33] Don’t disturb me, okay?
[01:35] Eat food, sleep.
Wake up, eat food and sleep.
[01:39] Are you not disturbed with your own life?
[01:41] What is wrong?
[01:43] Why are you shouting so much?
I am lying near you.
[01:46] After all, now Mona coming over
is going to be useless.
[01:51] here you go, tell her not to come.
[01:53] Tell her to get off the train and
get the train on the other side. Here.
[01:56] Your stubborn, beloved, lovely, arrogant
nephew is in love with some other girl.
[02:04] Yeah?
[02:05] Oh, okay. Okay.
[02:10] What are you staring at me for?
What fault do I have?
[02:12] No, Hammad, you have no fault.
[02:16] It is all my fault. I had seen a dream
[02:19] that I will rule this entire home.
[02:21] I was the one who dreamed
[02:23] that for the first time in your life
you will get off this bed
[02:26] and rule this home as the owner.
[02:28] With you alive,
no change will come in my life.
[02:49] God knows when he will wake up.
[02:54] Oh my drama grandma, you turned
out to be a great actor, my love.
[02:59] You know to tell you the truth,
I had no hope,
[03:01] but you acted so well.
Amazing.
[03:04] You were even better than
Sabiha Khannum.
[03:09] You know, grandma,
if Rania was not there,
[03:12] then this wouldn’t have happened.
[03:14] All credit goes to Rania.
Thank you Rania.
[03:16] No worries, buddy.
It was responsibility.
[03:19] Shall we go now
[03:20] or is there someone else
whose issues you have to resolve?
[03:22] Come on.
[03:23] No, its done.
It is enough for today.
[03:27] You did something great today.
Yes, what else?
[03:29] Now come on.
[03:31] I am coming. I will go, then.
[03:33] Okay, bye, bye, Rania.
[03:35] Okay, take care of yourself, bye.
You too, Ifrah. Bye.
[03:41] Okay, aunty, I too will leave.
I will come tomorrow.
[03:44] Yes, I too will come tomorrow.
Okay? Bye. Come on.
[03:49] Grandma!
[03:53] I still don’t believe it.
[03:57] What happened? Stop at least.
[04:00] What happened?
[04:02] Are you not happy with their proposal?
[04:05] Are you also in love with Ifrah?
[04:07] You just realized it.
[04:09] If you want, I can get the proposal cancelled,
you give it a shot.
[04:11] Quiet. Absolutely quiet.
[04:12] Don’t guess too much about me.
[04:15] And you don’t even talk to me.
[04:17] Why? Listen to me.
[04:19] Why are you so jealous of my success?
[04:22] Hey, if God has made me smarter than you,
[04:25] then what is my fault in this?
[04:28] Who told the hospital staff that
you are my fiancée?
[04:33] Oh, okay, so this is the matter.
[04:36] Okay stop. Stop.
Stop these dramas.
[04:39] I know everything.
[04:40] You stop dreaming with open eyes.
[04:42] These dreams of yours will
never turn into reality.
[04:45] Oh wow, you are badly mistaken.
[04:47] Man, I am not interested in hitting
the foot with an axe.
[04:54] Salik’s mother liked me,
[04:56] she was planning to ask
for my proposal,
[04:58] which is why I had to say this.
[04:59] And even if by mistake your family
tries to fix this proposal,
[05:03] I will give you poison
but I will not get married.
[05:06] Understand?
He thinks so highly of himself.
[05:08] Come on, now.
[05:10] Be quiet damn it.
Be quiet.
[05:16] Oh wow, she is such an amazing girl,
[05:18] she gets frank with everyone quickly.
[05:21] He is ready to do everyone’s work immediately.
[05:25] But her fiancé,
I found him to be really rude.
[05:29] Hey, what fiancé?
How is he her fiancé?
[05:32] Hey, he is not her fiancé.
He is her cousin
[05:34] What? Really?
[05:36] Actually, Salik’s mother wanted
to get Irfah and Mahir married.
[05:41] Okay,
[05:43] so this is the deal.
[05:46] Ayaz, when you meet her,
you too will be really happy.
[05:50] Yes. Yes, absolutely.
[05:51] Once Laraib gets fine,
we will go meet Rania directly.
[05:55] Brother, I am absolutely fine.
Please take me home
[05:58] Child, you are absolutely fine
in our eyes.
[06:00] Look, you are really unwell
in the eyes of the hospital.
[06:04] This hospital is on sister’s office panel,
[06:06] so the doctors are saying three
to four more tests are left.
[06:08] Enjoy.
[06:09] Ayaz, you be quiet.
[06:11] Yes, we will surely go to their home.
[06:14] Rania has done us a big favour bringing
Laiba to the hospital in time.
[06:18] Yes, yes, mama, you will be
really happy going there,
[06:21] because a lot of other good people
live there. Right, uncle?
[06:24] Not uncle. Ayaz.
[06:26] Okay, Mr. Ayaz,
[06:27] you know how good women live there,
really well mannered, pretty.
[06:33] Hey, I didn’t see anyone who could be
my match there, as such.
[06:36] Sister, we have come
to such weird times,
[06:39] the time of widows and
divorcees are getting over.
[06:42] Oh.
[06:44] You don’t lose hope.
You are not that old.
[06:47] You will find someone your match.
You will. Laiba, am I right?
[06:51] I don’t know, I want to go home.
[06:54] Are the nurses on strike?
[06:56] I think I will ask nurse Rebecca.
[06:58] Excuse me, madam Rebecca.
[07:01] She knows the entire procedure.
Rebecca.
[07:04] Madam Rebecca.
[07:07] Excuse me.
[07:17] Mano, Tipu, how many times
do I have to call you people?
[07:21] I will drag you inside.
This is the limit.
[07:23] Mama, just a little while.
No.
[07:24] Oh no.
Hey, sister Rania is here.
[07:30] Hello childrens.
[07:33] Sister Rania,
where did you go?
[07:35] Oh, it is a long story,
[07:37] I will sit and tell you comfortably.
[07:39] Today, I did something good.
[07:42] Come inside, I will tell you.
[07:52] Hey, Ifrah’s grandma acted so well
on my direction.
[07:57] If you people were there
you would have surely praised me.
[08:00] Ifrah’s grandmother was lying on the bed
as a sculpture of sympathy.
[08:04] But that Salik’s mother turned out
to be really stone-hearted.
[08:09] She wasn’t agreeing.
[08:12] Hey, even I am hungry.
Shehanshah get food for me as well.
[08:15] Shehanshah quickly heat the food
and bring it for her.
[08:17] Then, what happened next?
[08:18] Yes, then...
[08:19] Hey, I will tell you what happened then.
[08:22] She lied so much, praising Ifrah...
[08:26] You, focus on your food.
[08:27] It is not necessary to speak
in every matter.
[08:29] Hey, when did I lie?
[08:31] I just made Salik’s mother realize
[08:35] that Ifrah’s her son’s choice
[08:37] and she should be careful
about her son’s liking.
[08:40] Tell me, what is wrong in that?
[08:42] Yes, then she got insulted so badly,
I really enjoyed it.
[08:46] Ifrah’s mother told her,
[08:48] who are you to interfere
in the matter of our home.
[08:52] And she didn’t get embarrassed
she said she is Salik’s friend,
[08:58] Mahir, that is my future wife.
[09:00] What?
[09:01] Such a big lie.
[09:05] Mahir, tell me honestly
did she really say that?
[09:08] No, no, aunt, I...
[09:09] Yes, the moment she said it
[09:11] the whole staff of the hospital came
to sympathise with me.
[09:15] They say, man,
we are really sorry,
[09:17] your life is over before it started.
[09:20] She is your future wife?
[09:23] Hey, it was me,
I handled the situation.
[09:26] I told them we fixed the proposal
in the family’s pressure.
[09:29] I won’t marry her.
[09:31] So, when am I dying to marry you?
[09:34] I told you, I said to handle the situation.
[09:37] But no, he will tell this to everyone
again and again, on purpose.
[09:42] To feel good about himself that such a
beautiful girl got ready to marry him.
[09:51] Beautiful?
[09:53] Have you ever seen your face
in the mirror?
[09:56] She looks like the straw in
an empty bottle, right?
[10:07] It was funny, man.
[10:20] She has turned everyone towards her
[10:31] A person suffering from inferiority complex
is actually suffering from mental illness.
[10:41] Such a person hides their true self
[10:44] and tries to portray themselves
as something that they are not.
[10:48] Such a person should be tackled
like a patient with sympathy.
[10:54] Our Mahir turned out to be someone
suffering for mental illness.
[11:01] These statements he makes
praising himself,
[11:04] it is actually his inferiority complex.
[11:09] I couldn’t understand something so small.
[11:13] From today I will deal with him
the same way it is written in this book.
[11:21] Come on, Rania,
[11:23] you will become the prime minister,
[11:26] try to an expert psychiatrist
for a few days.
[11:36] Finish it quickly.
[11:38] Who eats a sandwich with
a spoon and fork?
[11:41] Eat properly.
[11:43] Hey, Mahir, listen,
[11:45] please drop the children to school.
They are getting late.
[11:47] Why?
Where is their father?
[11:50] Okay.
[11:52] They will go themselves.
There is nothing like
[11:54] that you clearly refused,
[11:56] now someone had to go
pick up my poor Mona.
[11:59] This means that Mona...
Mona has come.
[12:03] yes.
[12:05] Be quick brother will drop you
at school. Be quick.
[12:07] I am not dropping anyone,
anywhere.
[12:09] I have a lot of work to do.
[12:11] I have to go to the hospital
to meet Ifrah’s grandma,
[12:14] then I have to go to university as well.
[12:16] I have a lot of other things
to do as well. I am not available.
[12:18] Book a cab, and drop them yourself.
[12:20] You know, no child should
get a brother like you.
[12:23] Why do you worry aunt?
The bike is at home,
[12:26] I will go drop the children.
What do you, children?
[12:29] Hey, yes.
[12:33] I had forgotten children,
[12:35] we have the aunty who likes serving
humanity presents in our home.
[12:38] You do one thing,
[12:39] first drop the children
to school on the bike,
[12:42] then drop Rabail to college.
[12:44] After that, go to meet Ifrah’s grandmother
and Farhad’s sister.
[12:49] And..and..and...see if there is
something needed at home,
[12:52] then go and get it as well.
Okay?
[12:56] She thinks she will sort
the matters of the home,
[12:59] she doesn’t understand that
she is the biggest issue.
[13:03] She thinks so highly of herself.
Now
[13:05] I don’t get upset at anything you say.
[13:08] In fact, I sympathize with you.
[13:10] You can say anything to me,
I won’t mind. I swear.
[13:14] You didn’t get the love of parents
in childhood that’s why...
[13:20] What?
[13:21] What are you saying?
[13:22] Hey, I know it all.
[13:25] You do all this to hide your lacking
from the world,
[13:29] you have a new mask
on your face often.
[13:32] I know it all.
[13:33] I have understood the sorrow inside you.
Lacking? Sorrow?
[13:37] Have you gone mad?
Are you dreaming?
[13:41] You are saying weird things.
[13:43] Come on, children come.
I will drop you to school.
[13:47] What if she sleeps riding a bike,
we will face a loss.
[13:51] Sleep properly at night.
Okay, breakfast?
[13:53] Sorrow inside.
Drive carefully.
[13:57] Lunch. Okay eat this.
[13:59] Don’t you give him a lunch box?
[14:00] What will he eat when
he goes to the university?
[14:03] Wear a helmet
when riding the bike.
[14:06] All of them are the same in this home.
[14:09] I don’t know what
he will eat at the university.
[14:14] Okay, I will go outside
and start the bike.
[14:50] Where is Saman?
In her room
[14:54] Hey, the problems of that girl don’t end.
[14:57] Now if her husband is not coming to get her,
she will keep on mourning?
[15:01] What will Seema think?
Her sister is coming
[15:03] and Saman is not happy?
[15:07] There is really no happiness, mama.
[15:09] She is a weird woman.
[15:10] She says things, insults people and
when you respond, she gets upset.
[15:15] Okay, she is coming for a few days,
tolerate it.
[15:19] Where is Hamad?
He left in the morning to get them.
[15:24] The train must have gotten late,
what else?
[15:28] Hey child, what are you doing?
[15:31] The maid will do it, you leave it.
[15:34] Mama, I am bored of sitting idle.
[15:37] I don’t know when
my admission will be open.
[15:39] I am not used to sitting idle.
[15:41] Oh my love…
Oh…oh, mama.
[15:45] Careful. Careful.
Put it down. Put it down.
[15:48] She has brought the entire home.
[15:49] Okay, she is here.
Mama. Mama. Mona is here.
[15:54] Huh? Where is she?
[16:03] Hello. Hello.
Hello.
[16:06] Oh hello grandma.
[16:10] Greeting. Greetings.
Are you fine, child?
[16:14] How was your journey?
[16:15] My journey was really good,
just like me,
[16:18] but the train got a little late,
but no problem.
[16:20] Come on. Come on.
Have a seat. Sit down.
[16:23] Shehanshah, get some juice.
Come on.
[16:30] So this is Rania?
[16:32] You had made so much noise for no reason.
She is no beauty queen.
[16:35] I will run her over with my style.
[16:38] Greetings.
[16:39] Greetings.
How are you Rania?
[16:42] I am fine
[16:43] Sister praised you a lot
[16:45] Really?
[16:46] and Rabail you?
[16:48] I am fine too.
[16:49] You look really pretty,
[16:51] and I don’t see the rest of the people.
[16:54] The kids have gone for tuition.
[16:57] No, she is not talking about the kids,
she is talking about Mahir,
[17:00] they have good understanding.
[17:03] What? Really?
[17:05] Then you did good
that you came.
[17:07] Mama, call Mahir, tell him Mona is here,
he should come quickly.
[17:11] Actually he needs a good friend
a lot right now.
[17:17] Rania, stay quiet for some time,
you don’t know anything right now.
[17:21] I am finding out everything,
that’s why.
[17:24] Rania, please be quiet,
you really don’t know anything.
[17:28] Why are you tired like this? Huh?
Did you push the train?
[17:32] I am tired lifting the luggage.
[17:35] All of you leave it, I will call Mahir.
[17:38] Should I call him?
No, leave it, sit.
[17:49] What?
[17:51] Mona is here.
So? What do I do?
[17:54] Really? Don’t act so much.
[17:57] I know well how good an understanding
you two have.
[18:00] You know I thanked God she came.
[18:03] With her coming over, you will get
liveliness in your sad life.
[18:08] You instead of spitting fire,
will smile.
[18:11] Sad life? Mine?
[18:15] Why?
[18:17] Has my lover left me
and run away?
[18:19] Don’t say these stupid things about me.
[18:23] Sad life.
[18:25] And one more thing,
[18:27] you are not writing a book on me,
[18:29] so if you express your feelings,
[18:32] then I will forget that you are a relative
of my grandma’s beloved brother,
[18:35] whatever you are.
Understand?
[18:39] Deprivations have made you
really bitter.
[18:43] I feel that the inferiority complex
is really deep.
[18:49] But no problem, I understand,
[18:53] I will fix it.
[18:59] Uncle is usually
at home all day long,
[19:01] but right now he had to take the bike.
We could have easily gone on his bike.
[19:04] So, it is fine, we will take a rickshaw from
the corner of the road and go quickly to the mall.
[19:08] What is the tension?
[19:10] Okay, listen, don’t take too long.
[19:13] I don’t enjoy this shopping at all.
[19:15] It won’t take time at all.
I will get some things for myself,
[19:17] a birthday gift for my friend and
we will quickly come back.
[19:20] Sure?
Yes, sure. I promise.
[19:22] Fine, then.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[19:25] I have a complaint from you.
[19:27] From me? Why?
What did I do?
[19:31] You didn’t even come to the hospital
to ask about my sister’s health.
[19:38] I… I…
[19:40] I had sent Rania,
she visits often.
[19:44] But I was waiting for you.
[19:48] Err…
[19:49] now how would this poor thing know
that you are waiting for her. Huh?
[19:54] Okay, we are in a hurry,
we will meet again. Okay? Bye.
[19:59] Okay.
[20:00] We will come to your home soon.
[20:03] Why?
[20:04] Now what does he want?
Why would he come to our home?
[20:07] I don’t know, we will come back
and think about it. Come on.
[20:36] Come, lets check out these shoes.
[20:38] Hey, we get such shoes
in Khushalpur as well.
[20:41] Are you the same person who has a shop
in the big market in Khushalpur?
[20:45] Yes.
[20:46] He is the same. I told you.
[20:47] You get it, he will give a discount.
You will give us a discount, brother?
[20:53] Man, I am tired Rabail. Stop it.
Let’s go home, come on.
[20:56] Let me get some make up from here…
[20:57] No. No. No. No. I am hungry,
I want to eat something.
[21:00] See, coffee. Lets do one thing,
let’s get coffee and cupcakes. Okay?
[21:03] Yes, okay.
Come, we will have coffee from here.
[21:05] Okay, they also have really good
sandwiches.
[21:07] Come here. Come.
Check this. Okay…
[22:19] Rania.
[22:21] Rania.
[22:22] What happened?
Where were you?
[22:24] I have been looking for you for so long.
Come on, don’t you want to have coffee?
[22:25] You were so hungry and
now you have come here.
[22:28] Come on.
[22:42] Greetings.
[22:46] Did she lose her phone and
purse on gun point?
[22:49] She went inside really quietly.
[22:52] She is not that innocent.
[22:54] Nothing like that happened.
[22:56] She was fine when leaving home,
[22:58] she was also okay in the mall,
[22:59] suddenly something happened there
and she got in a bad mood.
[23:02] I have been asking her for so long,
but she is not telling me anything.
[23:05] She got in a bad mood,
going to the mall.
[23:08] Oh, I got it.
[23:11] Poor thing.
[23:12] What do you mean?
What did you understand?
[23:14] Obviously, you must be
shopping in the mall.
[23:17] You must have got expensive things,
you must have eaten,
[23:21] the poor thing must have felt
a lot seeing you.
[23:24] That is why she has the long face.
No, there is nothing like that.
[23:28] When I was shopping,
she was looking at me surprised
[23:31] that why I am buying such
cheap things so expensive.
[23:33] Yes, that is obvious, so that
you find out that she felt it.
[23:41] Rabail,
[23:43] why are you sitting here, idle?
[23:45] Please, will you go teach the children?
[23:47] I am unable to handle them at all.
Please.
[23:50] Fine.
[23:51] I will keep these things and
take care of the children.
[23:53] Yes, quickly.
[23:56] When did you come?
[23:58] And why do you watch
such boring things?
[24:01] Put on a good movie,
both of us will watch it together.
[24:05] Yes, movie.
Yes.
[24:07] We should put on a movie.
Good idea.
[24:09] Fine, I will go to my room and
put on a good movie.
[24:12] Yes, but I too want to watch it with you.
Please, wait.
[24:41] If my papa was alive,
[24:43] then he would have been this age.
[24:48] That man was just like my papa.
[24:52] Who was he?
[24:54] How can he look
so much like my father?
[24:57] Papa doesn’t even have a brother,
[25:00] no relative, no friends,
[25:03] I should have met him.
I should have talked to him,
[25:06] I should have asked who he is.
[25:08] I made such a big mistake, man.
[25:11] Now where do I look for him?
[25:21] Listen.
[25:24] Listen to me.
[25:26] Since I have come here,
[25:28] you didn’t even talk to me properly.
[25:30] I don’t know how to talk properly,
[25:33] that is why I talk less. You too try it.
[25:36] Meaning?
[25:37] Do I not talk properly?
[25:39] Hey, you have become really smart.
[25:41] Do you even know how far I have come
from and that too only for you.
[25:47] Why?
[25:49] Can I know the reason
for such a big favour?
[25:50] You were not like this earlier,
[25:53] you have changed a lot,
you have become really weird.
[25:55] Please become like you were earlier.
Please.
[25:58] Mona, when did I used to take you
for lunch and dinner earlier?
[26:01] Or we used to go on a long drive?
[26:04] Wow. Long drive?
Good idea. Shall we go?
[26:07] I will go get ready and come.
Ready?
[26:09] Yes.
[26:10] You will be ready further?
For God’s sake Mona,
[26:13] you put on so much make up
on your face,
[26:16] how does your skin breathe?
[26:19] You don’t breathe with your skin,
you breath with your mouth, idiot.
[26:29] Hello.
[26:30] Yes, Ifrah, hey,
you are still in the hospital?
[26:33] Hmmm…sister was absolutely right,
[26:36] this Rania is a a magician.
[26:39] Seeing her face,
[26:40] he doesn’t know the worth
of my branded makeup.
[26:44] But I too won’t leave him,
[26:46] I will teach him a lesson.
What?
[26:49] Grandma wants to meet Rania?
[26:52] You mean to say,
grandma is missing Rania?
[26:56] Not just missing her,
she is missing her badly.
[26:59] Oh my God,
[27:00] this means that grandma’s condition
is really critical.
[27:03] The medication has directly
affected her mind.
[27:05] You go, get the medication changed
by the doctor, immediately.
[27:08] What? What do you mean?
[27:10] I mean, hey, Rania,
[27:13] she is so irritating,
how can someone miss her?
[27:16] I mean, can some long to meet her?
[27:19] It is impossible.
[27:20] No, she is a really good girl,
she is really sweet,
[27:23] even I want to meet her.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[27:25] Now tell me what you think of me.
[27:27] Please, man, Ifrah,
[27:29] I am so shocked.
I am surprised.
[27:31] You be shocked,
but do bring Rania tomorrow.
[27:34] Understand? Bye.
How can I… bye.
[27:43] They have all gone mad.
[28:03] Mahir, isn’t that Rania?
[28:06] What is she doing alone
in the garden?
[28:08] Hey, this is Rania grandma,
[28:10] she has a license for madness.
[28:12] Even if she hangs upside down
from the tree,
[28:15] then you don’t worry.
You sit calmly.
[28:18] It is late in the evening,
and the weather is changing,
[28:22] you go and see what she is doing.
[28:23] Hey, grandma nothing will happen to her.
[28:25] I am anyway, playing an important game.
[28:27] I am telling you to go.
[28:30] Fine, I will go because you are asking me.
[28:33] What is this problem!
[28:48] Grandma is worried.
[28:51] What happened?
[28:54] I mean, what are you doing
sitting here so late?
[28:58] Tell her I will come in a while,
don’t worry.
[29:01] She is not worried about you.
[29:04] She is worried that the ghosts and
monsters that live on these trees for years,
[29:07] their children might get scared of you
and runaway.
[29:11] More than mama
I feel you are worried for them.
[29:14] Are you in love with a witch?
[29:16] Oh God, forgive me.
[29:20] Never bring such a bad time in my life
that I have to love her.
[29:26] Do I look like a witch?
[29:27] Just cause Mona came in your life,
[29:29] you like to joke around all the time
[29:31] You don’t look like a witch,
you are a witch.
[29:34] Child, why are you walking around
alone in the garden?
[29:39] Look, the weather is changing
you might fall ill.
[29:41] Mama, the weather has changed.
[29:44] The one who used to frown
all time are now always smiling.
[29:49] Hey the life of people has changed.
[29:52] Their life is full of spring.
[30:01] Come on, come inside. Come on.
[30:03] Come.
[30:06] Come. I came after you.
[30:11] Oh, you have such a long face.
[30:14] You are disappointed like
you don’t know about him.
[30:17] He is like that, stubborn and annoyed.
[30:19] If you know his temperament is
stubborn and annoyed,
[30:22] then why have you given me hope?
[30:25] First he had a lot of tantrums,
he didn’t give me any lift,
[30:28] he had a lot of pride. But now,
now he is in love with someone.
[30:33] And now he is so in love seeing
that villagers washed face,
[30:36] that he doesn’t like my face.
My make up!
[30:40] Did Mahir say something?
[30:42] Not something,
[30:45] he said a lot and on top of that
he made fun of me.
[30:48] Oh, so this is the matter.
[30:51] Look Mona,
this girl is really cunning.
[30:54] Like a cunning vixen.
[30:57] She has the whole family
in the palm of her hand.
[30:59] We have to break her magic,
I am telling you.
[31:02] We don’t have to give up.
We will degrade her in Mahir’s eyes.
[31:07] But how?
[31:09] Both us sisters will sit
and plan something.
[31:11] Whatever you want to do,
do it quickly.
[31:13] I don’t have time.
And whatever time is left,
[31:16] I don’t want to waste it on him.
[31:18] There the contractor’s poor son
is waiting for me there.
[31:21] Now I don’t want to miss
my other chance for him.
[31:25] Damn you, Mona.
[31:26] Here, I have found a prince like boy for you
[31:30] and you are dreaming about the stupid,
illiterate son of the contractors.
[31:35] Don’t mention him in front of me again.
Understand?
[31:38] Mahir correctly made fun of you.
[31:40] Look at your level.
Your standard has fallen so low.
[31:43] Hey, I didn’t say he is my prince charming.
[31:48] I have just kept him in reserve.
[31:51] For God’s sake be quiet.
If someone hears us,
[31:54] then I don’t know about you,
but I will be really embarrassed.
[31:59] Okay fine, but tell me
what will you do now and how?
[32:02] I will tell Mahir that the kids are insisting
on eating ice cream,
[32:06] I will stop the kids at the last moment,
you go with him.
[32:10] That’s what I am talking about. Fine,
I will quickly go and get ready.
[32:15] Oh God, Mona, how much
more will you dress up?
[32:18] Oh man,
[32:20] everyone has an issue with my makeup.
[32:23] I am used to living in a modern lifestyle
[32:26] and I cannot change myself for anyone.
[32:28] I will go touch up. Okay, bye.
[32:33] She is really stubborn.
[32:35] Come in.
[32:40] Irfah called yesterday,
[32:42] her grandma has sent
a message for you.
[32:44] I am sure she sent her greetings.
Greetings from me to her as well.
[32:49] There is something greater
than the greetings.
[32:52] She has been impressed
by your buttering.
[32:54] She wants to be inspired
by your smartness.
[32:57] She has called you to meet her.
Really?
[32:59] I will surely go to meet her.
[33:01] I am leaving for the hospital.
You have half an hour,
[33:05] get ready and come
or else I will leave.
[33:07] Why half an hour?
I will just come.
[33:10] Okay, then.
[33:29] He is leaving her room,
he doesn’t even come to my room.
[33:33] Be quiet.
Are you ready?
[33:36] Yes, for so long.
[33:37] Mahir.
[33:39] Mahir. Mahir.
Listen to me.
[33:42] See, since my Mona has come,
[33:44] she is locked up at home,
take her out for ice cream.
[33:47] Aunt, right now I am going to the hospital.
[33:49] Mona, why don’t you do one thing,
go out with uncle and aunt for ice cream.
[33:53] This way the kids will also have it too.
It is a nice idea.
[33:55] Come on. Come on.
are really late .
[33:57] Thank you so much for your advice.
[34:05] Cool. Cool. Stay cool.
You will sit in front all your life.
[34:12] I wanted to go.
[34:14] I will make such a plan that
you will be with her all your life.
[34:17] Come on, come inside now.
[34:19] The sun is shining hard,
we will get tanned.
[34:23] Oh, I don’t believe it,
[34:25] Ifrah and her grandma asked for me.
[34:27] Hey, madam Rania,
you have no idea about your qualities.
[34:31] Hey, you have such a personality
[34:33] that if a person meets you once,
[34:36] and they don’t meet you again,
it is not possible.
[34:38] Huh? Really?
[34:40] Yes, yes, what do you think?
I am lying to you?
[34:42] You have an amazing personality.
[34:45] You have so much knowledge
that once someone talks to you,
[34:47] he is unable to survive without
benefitting from your learnings
[34:51] Don’t praise me so much.
Hey, I am right
[34:53] In fact, I think a book should be
written on your life. Huh?
[34:57] Yes, and the title of the book will be,
legends of Rania Jutt.
[35:03] You are riding on a horse
and approaching, you say,
[35:05] Rania doesn’t die till Rania kills Rania.
[35:12] Go ahead, speak up, what happened?
why did you get quiet?
[35:14] Speak up, come on. I want to benefit
from your learnings.
[35:18] You are mistaken and badly mistaken.
[35:26] Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome.
[35:30] Greetings, how are you?
[35:31] I am absolutely fine,
but you have a long life.
[35:35] I was just thinking about you.
[35:36] I was thinking of taking your number
from Ifrah and call you.
[35:39] I was really missing you talking
and your innocent face.
[35:43] Oh, hi hero.
[35:45] He too has come along.
[35:47] Hey, he doesn’t leave you alone.
[35:49] Hey, you should give him a
one hour class daily.
[35:53] Hey teach him to laugh and smile.
[35:56] He is really different
from your personality.
[35:59] I will go meet grandma.
[36:04] By the way, the boy is really good,
[36:07] but isn’t he a little stubborn?
[36:08] You will have to work a little hard
[36:10] and this flaw will also be removed.
[36:12] Why would I work hard?
[36:13] His wife will come, she will fix him.
[36:16] What?
[36:17] You two are not engaged?
[36:20] Who said this to you?
[36:24] I was thinking something else.
[36:26] Okay, right now
I am going to meet grandma,
[36:28] when I come back,
I will give you my number.
[36:30] You can call me when you want.
Okay?
[36:33] You are so cute yourself.
I will come
[36:38] You have something, I made all this
myself and brought it for you.
[36:41] Hey, you made so many things?
Why so much formality, sister?
[36:44] Hey, there is no formality.
Okay come, have these oats.
[36:46] Taste it. This is really good for you.
So many things.
[36:48] I don’t know where Rania is,
she has not come till now.
[36:52] She has made so many relatives
in the hospital.
[36:54] She must be busy talking to someone.
[36:56] She will come in a while.
[36:57] Hey, what do I tell you
about that child?
[37:00] She is not our blood,
we have no relation with her,
[37:04] but it feels she is my own blood.
[37:05] It seems like she is
my own granddaughter.
[37:08] Why? Because of her good behaviour.
What else?
[37:10] You are right.
[37:12] Hey Mahir, you are really lucky.
[37:15] Yes?
[37:18] Yes, thank you.
[37:20] Child, you don’t find such a good girl
in today’s time, even if you search.
[37:24] You are right.
You are absolutely right.
[37:27] I have had enough.
Aunty, I will tell you
[37:29] that I am not the lucky one…
Mahir.
[37:34] This…
[37:35] this bottle…I am unable
to open its cap.
[37:43] What is the bottle that you are unable
to remove the cap from it?
[37:46] You wanted to ruin all our efforts?
[37:47] Really?
[37:48] And what about how you people have
connected that useless girl’s name with mine?
[37:51] Can you not tolerate it for a while?
[37:53] Tolerate it for me and Salik.
[37:55] After all, she is not that bad.
She is a really good girl.
[37:57] Now if you say another word
praising her,
[37:59] then I will tell everyone the truth.
Greetings.
[38:02] Greetings.
How are you?
[38:05] Live long. Stay happy.
How are you?
[38:08] I am fine, we were just talking
about you.
[38:10] How are you feeling?
[38:12] I am much better, thank God.
[38:14] It is such a good coincidence that
I came and you people are also here.
[38:17] We got to meet each other.
[38:18] Yes, I was just saying this to Mahir,
[38:21] that he really lucky that
he got a life partner like you.
[38:24] Absolutely. Absolutely.
[38:28] Yes. Yes,
[38:31] Mahir is lucky in every matter.
[38:34] Yes, absolutely.
She is right aunty.
[38:36] I am so lucky that I got engaged
to her in childhood.
[38:40] Luck knocked on my door in childhood.
[38:43] Hey, so she is your fiancée
since childhood?
[38:46] Mahir, why did you not tell us
this earlier?
[38:48] He did. He told us many times.
[38:50] He told me and Salik several times.
Right, Salik? He told us, right?
[38:54] Yes, yes, absolutely.
[38:55] He has even asked me to ask mama
to fix my wedding date.
[39:02] I cannot wait anymore.
[39:05] Mahir,
[39:06] whether you invite us to
your wedding or not,
[39:09] we will all surely come.
[39:13] Sure. Sure.
Sure, do come
[39:15] Hey child, see this.
Taste it.
[39:17] I made all this with my hands
and brought it.
[39:19] Really?
