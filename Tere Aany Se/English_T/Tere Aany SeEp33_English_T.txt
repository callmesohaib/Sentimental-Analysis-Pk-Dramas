[00:20] Mian Jee, I am really sad.
[00:23] I want to come to you.
[00:25] But my education.
[00:27] Hey, don’t worry, we are coming to
you to the city. I spoke to Zaman.
[00:34] Really? When?
[00:36] You have made me really happy
giving me this news, Mian Jee.
[00:39] When are you people coming?
[00:41] I want that you come quickly
and I run and hug you.
[00:44] Hey, I am coming to meet my daughter,
what else?
[00:51] Oh God, today is really good.
[00:53] I already had a feeling that
today would be good.
[00:56] Okay, you start your preparation quickly.
[00:58] When you come, I will invite mama
and everyone, we will party together.
[01:01] Yes, do what you want,
just tell me how is sister?
[01:05] Now you know the situation of the home,
and that Mahir?
[01:09] Even Mahir left the home and went.
He is staying at a friend’s home.
[01:13] Yes.
[01:14] Aunty Sweetie has bothered
everyone including me.
[01:17] Listen, to me. the thing is that
God has betterment in everything.
[01:23] Now this woman, her allegations,
[01:27] because of that you and
your father has come together
[01:30] or else God knows how long these
distances would have lasted.
[01:33] Even in future if we stay strong,
everything will be fine.
[01:36] There is nothing like that.
[01:38] These worries will be converted in happiness.
[01:42] Tell Mahir not have a small heart,
tough times don’t last.
[01:47] Fine, I will make him understand.
[01:49] Okay fine, I am waiting for you people.
[01:51] Goodbye.
[01:53] Okay child.
[02:03] Live long. Live long. My prince.
I worry for you so much.
[02:10] Grandma, you don’t need to worry about me,
[02:13] I am absolutely fine. Just pray for me.
[02:15] I do that, but I think about you often how
my prince will be living in a stranger’s home.
[02:21] Welcome. Welcome. Mahir. How are you?
I am so happy to see you.
[02:26] You know, I was so worried for you,
ask your father.
[02:30] I don’t need to ask anyone anything
[02:33] and you too shouldn’t worry for me.
Thank you.
[02:37] Mahir, look I…
[02:40] I am really embarrassed on my past behavior
and I promise this wont happen in future.
[02:47] Look, your step mom
has such a big home
[02:50] and you have left it and
you are staying with someone else.
[02:52] It doesn’t look nice.
Come on, leave it, you come back.
[02:55] I think you are preparing
for a new game. Huh?
[02:59] I will tell you something,
now I wont tolerate it.
[03:03] I want to blow you away with a canon.
[03:06] Mama, I am telling you
that Mahir comes back.
[03:09] After all, why shouldn’t he?
[03:11] It is his house. I am really saying it
with my heart, Mahir you come back.
[03:16] I will.
[03:18] Don’t worry. I will come back really soon,
[03:21] but after I do something on my own.
[03:25] Grandma,
[03:27] even if small,
[03:30] I have decided to start my own business.
[03:32] Congratulations. Congratulations
[03:34] You wont get anything doing
a business in this country.
[03:39] Grandma,
[03:41] uncle Zaman has said he will really
help me out in my business.
[03:44] Any form of guidance or any loan
I require, he is willing to give it.
[03:50] Look Mahir, all this is yours,
[03:52] why do you need to do a business.
[03:55] Okay, come on, let go of your anger.
[03:57] Okay, you tell me, what should I cook for you?
What do you want to eat?
[04:01] Food?
[04:03] Hey, grandma, Rania had made such
great food that I ate so much.
[04:09] Rania has a lot of taste in her hand.
[04:11] I ate at uncle Zaman’s home,
my stomach is full.
[04:14] Oh, that is great.
[04:19] Grandma,
[04:21] I will take guidance from uncle Zaman,
[04:23] but taking a loan from him,
[04:26] my pride doesn’t allow me
to take money from him.
[04:29] I will say no to him.
[04:30] But to start the business,
I will still need money, you will help me, right?
[04:37] Hey when do you need my help son?
[04:39] This entire home,
this whole wealth is in your name,
[04:44] whenever you want, you can sell it
and invest it in your business.
[04:48] Don’t worry about us,
I will live in a small home. Don’t worry.
[04:53] No, no, grandma, nothing like that will ever happen.
Thank you so much.
[04:56] Without your permission,
I couldn’t even think of doing anything like that.
[04:59] After all, you are the head of this family.
[05:34] Hello.
[05:35] Hello.
[05:36] Do you have so much courage?
Do you consider me so weightless?
[05:41] Who?
[05:42] I am the one who showed you
stars in the day time.
[05:45] I hope you recognize me now.
[05:48] Oh, okay. Mama’s bad luck…
oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
[05:52] are you mama’s bad luck?
[05:54] Shut up.
[05:55] Control your tongue.
[05:58] Mahir is our son,
how dare you offer him help?
[06:02] He is our son and
he is now living at our home.
[06:05] You stay away from him, understand?
[06:08] You are wasting your time.
[06:10] You know I will not listen to you. Right?
I will become stubborn instead.
[06:16] So it is better that you go and
tell Mahir to stay away from me.
[06:20] Hmm…
[06:21] I think you forgot your insult.
[06:25] No. No. I will always remember that.
[06:28] And it would better that
you don’t call me again.
[06:32] Because it is possible that next time
I wont be able to talk with respect.
[06:36] I too am not interested in calling you.
I am just warning…
[06:43] She is a stubborn and ill-mannered girl.
[06:50] Hey that old woman is
really cunning and cheap.
[06:54] She has changed her methods
in such a way that I am scared.
[06:57] They say for such people that being their friend
is not good, nor is being their enemy good.
[07:02] I am not stupid.
[07:04] I see it all and I also understand.
[07:09] Okay grandma, I will leave now.
[07:12] You just came, sit.
[07:14] By the way, Mahir, ask Rabail,
everyone misses you so much.
[07:18] You took the liveliness
of the home with you.
[07:21] My children are always sad,
they are asking for brother Mahir all the time.
[07:26] I know, but you don’t be sad.
[07:29] All of us will live together really soon.
[07:33] Okay tell me, you are coming for uncle Ayaz
and Bebo’s engagement, right?
[07:37] First let their proposal get fixed.
[07:39] I don’t know
if they accept his proposal or not.
[07:43] By the way, Rania will try.
[07:45] Uncle Ayaz is good
and he really likes Bebo.
[07:49] Oh, is this it?
[07:51] Then I too am Rania’s grandmother,
I will make sure this proposal gets fixed.
[07:57] No matter what Zaman says,
I will make sure this proposal gets fixed.
[08:01] Long live, mama.
[08:02] You know, the prayers of sad
hearts are answered quickly
[08:06] and uncle Ayaz will raise his hand
and pray for you all his life.
[08:09] Okay then.
[08:11] Okay grandma, I will leave.
Take care, I am late.
[08:15] Take care.
Goodbye.
[08:17] Live long. Live long.
Goodbye. Okay uncle, goodbye.
[08:20] Goodbye. Goodbye.
[08:29] Greetings madam.
Greetings.
[08:31] Please make me a cup of tea.
I have a bad headache.
[08:33] I will just make it.
Is papa back?
[08:34] No, he has not come till now.
Okay, just make me tea.
[08:37] Madam, this sir is also
waiting for elder sir.
[08:42] Mahir, you?
Sorry, I didn’t see you.
[08:47] Obviously,
[08:48] now you have become
so rich that you don’t see us.
[08:52] I am still the same Rania,
[08:54] but those who give preference to wealth
over people wont understand me.
[08:59] Anyway, it is okay.
[09:02] Make a cup of tea for him too.
[09:03] Sure.
[09:04] No, there is no need for that. It is okay.
[09:08] Why? Why is there no need?
[09:10] Have you stopped drinking tea?
[09:13] Come on.
[09:15] First you tell me something, Rania.
[09:17] Why did you hide something
so big from me?
[09:20] That Dr. Wasiq is not your brother,
why didn’t you tell me this?
[09:24] What are you saying?
when did I hide it and when did you ask me?
[09:28] Yes, fine, I didn’t ask you,
[09:30] but still,
[09:31] you should have mentioned it to me.
[09:33] Mentioned what?
[09:38] I feel you are not well.
[09:40] Now you won’t find me well,
nor will you think I am feeling well.
[09:43] If you say these things,
then I really won’t feel you are fine.
[09:47] You have changed a lot, Rania.
[09:51] If that Dr. Wasiq is not your brother,
[09:54] then with what relation is
he living in this home?
[09:58] Papa must be on his way,
you can ask him. Okay?
[10:00] And also record your objection.
[10:03] I feel you are really disturbed at Salik’s home,
that is why you are saying such weird things.
[10:08] I am not saying weird things.
And I don’t like this Dr. Wasiq one bit.
[10:13] So this is your issue. Not mine.
[10:16] Who have you liked till today?
You have always praised yourself.
[10:20] You feel that if you look at a girl properly,
she will fall in love with you.
[10:25] You are mistaken, and remember,
[10:29] those who praise themselves,
[10:31] are often left alone.
[10:35] Papa must be coming,
[10:37] I will send tea.
[10:52] I shouldn’t have spoken
so rudely to Mahir.
[10:57] The poor thing is already in a tough situation.
He came to ask papa for advice.
[11:06] What must he be thinking?
[11:08] That my mind is in the skies,
I am showing tantrums.
[11:12] Argh, what is wrong with me.
[11:14] I am doing stupid things.
[11:17] I made such a big mistake.
[11:21] I should have stood by him
like a sincere person.
[11:25] I shouldn’t have asked Rania about Dr. Wasiq.
[11:30] What must she be thinking about me?
[11:35] I don’t know what is wrong
with me nowadays.
[11:37] I am acting so stupid.
[11:40] I go to say one thing and I say another.
[11:45] My respect is ruined.
[11:46] What do I do now?
[11:49] Should I go and say sorry?
[11:51] I will go say sorry.
[11:53] Madam Rania, sir is asking about you.
[11:56] Okay, I am coming.
[11:57] Listen, the guest that came,
he is still there, right?
[11:59] No madam, he left.
[12:02] He left?
[12:03] Didn’t papa stop him for dinner?
[12:05] Hey madam, sir stopped him
and he even agreed,
[12:09] but he left as soon as little master came.
He said he has something important to do.
[12:15] Okay I am coming, you go.
[12:17] Sure.
[12:20] Man, this is the limit.
[12:21] Mahir is mad.
[12:25] Now what do I do?
[12:27] I don’t know what issue
he has with Dr. Wasiq.
[12:31] Salik, I feel that my life has been
surrounded by difficulties from all sides
[12:36] and I am unable to handle it.
[12:40] I don’t know
what I am doing in my worry?
[12:42] Look Mahir, good and
bad situations are part of life.
[12:45] Don’t worry like this, don’t worry.
[12:48] after all I have spoken to papa,
the loan will get approved, you will see.
[12:51] Hey loan…
[12:54] it is not about money, man.
[12:58] I am worried cause of Rania.
[13:02] One minute. One minute. One minute.
[13:04] Did you misbehave
with his respectable father?
[13:09] Mahir, how many times have
I told you not to show attitude.
[13:15] Keep it on the side.
Be down to earth.
[13:18] Man, you be quiet.
[13:20] Don’t talk nonsense.
[13:22] Hey, did his father drag you out
thinking of you as a poor relative?
[13:29] If this was my home,
[13:31] then I would have surely
dragged you out of this home.
[13:34] But what can I do?
[13:35] I am helpless,
[13:37] this is your home.
[13:39] I myself am dependent on you.
[13:40] Mahir, what are you saying?
[13:43] What is this your and mine?
In future please don’t say this again.
[13:47] Whatever I have is all yours. Okay?
[13:50] Okay stop now.
[13:51] Don’t be too filmy.
[13:53] This home is mine.
[13:57] Man, Salik,
[14:00] this journey of mine is tough and long.
[14:05] I don’t know who all will be
able to walk with me.
[14:11] I don’t want to lose Rania.
[14:15] If Rania is with me,
[14:18] I can handle the most difficult
of situations like this, easily.
[14:25] But she is becoming really distant from me.
[14:30] What if she goes really far?
[14:35] Okay, one crispy green beans and
surely bring shrimps, also California roll.
[14:44] Two. Ceaser salad.
[14:46] And yes, coconut curry. Vegetable.
[14:51] And crispy honey chicken too
and do please bring fresh lime.
[14:57] Have we invited someone else too?
[15:01] No, just the two of us. Two doves.
[15:06] Just order enough that we can eat.
This is not the last lunch of our life.
[15:15] Listen to me, I hate miserly men.
[15:21] Okay sorry, I was joking.
[15:24] Brother bring whatever you have.
[15:27] There is no need.
[15:29] Just bring what we ordered.
[15:32] I don’t eat much, this is enough.
[15:33] Enough? It should be enough.
[15:37] Go.
[15:39] Listen, should I give you a shocking news?
[15:43] Farhad’s uncle is getting
married to Rania’s aunt.
[15:48] He is average. Middle class.
[15:51] I sympathize with Bebo.
[15:53] Poor thing.
[15:55] I don’t understand, how can someone
spend their life without money.
[15:58] I too want to shock you too.
[16:01] Oh God.
[16:03] I know you are going gift
me a new phone, right?
[16:08] Our business is really down.
[16:11] I have asked papa Mona is unlucky.
[16:14] Since we fixed the proposal,
we are facing loss.
[16:17] Now what if Mona that till the marriage
we face so much loss
[16:22] that we are forced to go into our great
grandfather’s business…I mean scrap business.
[16:27] But you know what papa said?
[16:29] He said no one has dark steps,
[16:32] it is the situation of the country that
a person doesn’t have money to eat food,
[16:37] so where will a person gather cement etc,
to make a home, why would he think about it?
[16:45] What happened?
Why are you staring at me so much?
[16:48] Did you get spice in your eyes?
Take this.
[16:52] What did you call me?
[16:54] What happened?
You heard about the loss in the business
[16:58] and decided to end all relations.
[17:01] Have patience, calmly,
everything will be fine my love.
[17:05] Listen, now no need to
call me love before marriage,
[17:10] because I am not that type of girl.
[17:13] Okay sorry, I wont. Promise.
[17:16] What else did you say?
You called me unlucky.
[17:19] Okay. Okay. Sorry. It slipped my tongue.
[17:22] I don’t know what and
where you have to say to a girl.
[17:28] Look we have ordered so much food,
at least eat it and go,
[17:31] or else you will think at night
that I wish I had eaten.
[17:33] Please sit, please. Sorry.
[17:43] You don’t want to eat anything else, right?
[17:45] Yes, I forgot to ask him for coffee,
do tell him to bring it.
[17:52] Honey, we have met after so many years,
happy to see you. How was your journey?
[17:58] It was good but tiring.
[18:00] Yeah.
[18:02] Meet him, the most arrogant,
[18:05] handsome and dashing man
has come to welcome you.
[18:08] His name is Mahir.
[18:09] Hi.
[18:11] Hi, how are you?
[18:12] I am good, how are you?
[18:13] I am…
[18:15] sick.
[18:17] I don’t think you are fine.
[18:19] Salik, I think we should take him to the doctor.
You know, flu can be very contagious.
[18:23] No. No. it is fine.
[18:25] In America they are scared of flu,
but here it is really common.
[18:28] I will be fine. if a medical store comes on the way,
stop the car, I will get some medication.
[18:34] Honey, don’t worry at all.
He is absolutely fine.
[18:36] You started your drama seeing a girl.
[18:39] Please, can you pass?
[18:46] Salik, very bad.
[18:48] What sort of a friend are you?
[18:49] He has a high fever.
We should take him to a doctor.
[18:53] No. No. It is okay.
[18:55] I told you,
[18:57] there is no need to go to a doctor.
[18:59] I will get fine after taking medication
from the medical store. Thank you.
[19:02] Mahir.
[19:03] Bless you.
[19:05] Dr. Wasiq’s clinic is on the way,
should I get you treated there properly?
[19:09] Salik, you will feel really embarrassed
being beaten in front of your cousin.
[19:13] If you want to save yourself from embarrassment,
then medical store and medicines.
[19:21] Did you clean it properly?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
[19:24] Mian Jee, Bebo and mama are
coming in exactly three hours.
[19:28] I am so happy I cannot tell you.
[19:30] I will do this, you go check
the arrangements in the kitchen.
[19:32] Yes, I will.
[19:33] Do one thing, tell me what my order was.
Yes, are those two done?
[19:37] Fine. Fine.
And do bring those cold drinks.
[19:40] I will send you my address. Yes. Yes.
[19:44] Hey Salik, how are you?
[19:47] I am fine, Rania, but Mahir is not well
and he is not agreeing to go to the hospital.
[19:52] He is insisting for no reason.
I cannot control him at all.
[19:56] What? What happened to Mahir?
[19:58] He has high fever.
[20:00] Okay I am coming. Yes, yes,
I am coming right now. I am reaching shortly.
[20:03] Okay. Okay.
[20:05] I will just SMS…
Doctor. Doctor.
[20:08] You will have to come with me.
[20:10] Right now?
The guests are about to arrive.
[20:13] Hey, when will they go back
if we are not here?
[20:16] There is anyway a lot of
time for them to come still.
[20:18] Mahir is unwell, he needs me.
Please come with me.
[20:21] Okay,
[20:24] now I understand this worry of yours.
[20:26] You understand, right?
Shall we go?
[20:29] Come on. Come on.
[20:40] Just a second.
[20:43] Careful.
[20:44] One minute. One minute.
[20:46] Thank you.
[20:49] Bless you.
[20:52] Honey, you are my cousin.
[20:54] Meaning both my respect and shame.
[20:58] And this is Pakistan,
here you don’t hold arms.
[21:02] Is this the time to talk about these things?
See, he is so unwell.
[21:05] No. No. It is okay. Thank you.
I am fine. actually, in my home…
[21:13] Bless you.
[21:15] I have never fallen ill like this. that’s why.
[21:19] You go inside and meet uncle and aunty,
they must be waiting for you.
[21:23] Are you sure?
Yes. Yes. I am fine.
[21:25] Are they here? They are here!
Greetings!
[21:27] How are you my love?
Greetings.
[21:30] My child. How are you?
I am fine.
[21:33] How was your journey, child?
Really good.
[21:35] Come on. Come on.
[21:37] She has grown up so much,
she must be tired.
[21:40] Come child, come quickly.
[21:45] This cousin of yours,
[21:46] sympathizes a little more than 
what is required.
[21:48] Come on, take me to the room.
[21:50] Yes, so come on.
Who has stopped you?
[21:52] Why are you pushing me?
[21:53] I am already unwell,
[21:56] my head is spinning, I also see less.
[22:03] Mahir, you are not that unwell, okay?
I know you well.
[22:07] Don’t consider me like Honey.
[22:09] Come on. Come on. Listen,
keep this Honey away from my room.
[22:14] Hello dear Honey.
[22:17] How are you?
[22:18] Are you fine? have you reached safely?
Was there any issue in the flight?
[22:23] Not at all.
Actually the flight was really comfortable.
[22:26] Very good. Very good.
[22:27] Okay tell me, Honey,
are you uncle and aunt fine?
[22:33] Yes, they are all fine.
actually they got really happy to see me.
[22:37] You know old relations
have a different attraction.
[22:40] Yes, Honey, child, that is true. That is true.
[22:43] Hello Honey, you immediately called uncle after
reaching Pakistan, you should have called me.
[22:49] You are always jealous of me.
This is the limit.
[22:53] I was also going to call you.
[22:55] Honey, you should have called me first.
I am your real relative.
[22:59] Here I am tired of conspiring for
your bright future but you don’t care.
[23:04] That is not true aunty,
actually uncle was saying for a few days….
[23:07] Okay leave all this
and come home immediately.
[23:09] Sorry aunty,
I cannot come so soon.
[23:12] What do you mean you
cannot come so soon?
[23:15] Listen to me, Honey.
I am as hard as I am soft.
[23:19] What if I come to get you myself?
[23:21] Aunty I told you I will stay here for a few days,
I cannot come. Okay bye.
[23:29] I think this Honey wants
her legs broken by me.
[23:33] Oh, there she also has
a cousin from his uncle.
[23:36] Oh, if they trap Honey,
then my entire plan will fail.
[23:59] She didn’t even call.
[24:01] Salik,
[24:06] you had said that you
informed Rania that I am unwell.
[24:10] Hey Mahir, I informed her, I wont lie to you.
[24:15] You informed her?
[24:18] She didn’t come even
after you informed her.
[24:20] this means she doesn’t care about me.
[24:23] She can go to hell.
[24:25] This means brother you have failed to win her heart,
 and you have also lost your bet.
[24:30] Hey, to hell with that bet,
and don’t even mention that bet after today.
[24:35] How are you feeling now?
[24:36] Everything is absolutely fine,
you don’t need to worry.
[24:39] It is time for his medication.
Did you call his parents or not?
[24:43] Hey, I only have fever.
[24:44] What is the need to call and
inform the whole of Pakistan?
[24:48] Look, listen to me,
you took a long flight and rest.
[24:53] Don’t worry about me.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
[24:56] Salik.
[24:58] Salik.
[24:59] Hey, Rania is here. Rania is here.
[25:04] Are you okay? He has fainted.
[25:07] Oh God, what did you do to him?
[25:11] Why have you still not
taken him to the hospital?
[25:15] What are you standing there for?
Come and check him.
[25:20] I should check? Yes.
[25:37] He is absolutely fine. Nothing happened to him.
Nothing to worry about.
[25:41] Huh? Yes.
[25:42] Yes, yes I am absolutely fine.
Nothing to worry about.
[25:46] What will happen to me?
[25:47] I was staging a drama in front of you people.
[25:49] And this friend of mine, Salik, 
he cares about me.
[25:52] He cares for me that is why he called you people 
and asked you to come.
[25:56] And why have you people come here?
You people don’t need to care for me.
[25:58] Go from here. Leave. I am fine.
[26:00] How is he fine?
See how out of breath he is.
[26:03] He is not well at all.
[26:05] He should have a complete
check up from a good doctor.
[26:08] What do you mean?
Is he not a good doctor?
[26:10] He is a capable doctor,
he has fixed the best.
[26:13] Rania, you are using the wrong idiom.
[26:15] So? Hang me.
[26:17] Man, you people stop arguing.
[26:19] Here I am unwell
and you people are arguing.
[26:22] Go. Leave. Leave from here.
I don’t need anyone, leave me alone.
[26:25] I cannot leave you alone like this.
This way your stress level will go up.
[26:31] Who is she? What is she doing here?
[26:35] Sorry, I forgot to introduce you to her.
This is my cousin, she came from America.
[26:40] Hi.
[26:42] Hi.
[26:43] Oh now I understand
why Mr. Mahir was in a bad mood.
[26:49] We came at the wrong time,
[26:51] there are already enough
people to care for him here.
[26:57] Come on, doctor.
[26:58] Okay come on.
[27:02] I am leaving.
[27:03] I am not in the habit to care
for someone for no reason.
[27:06] Rania. Rania. Rania, you just came
and doctor you came for the first time,
[27:11] I will get great tea for you.
No. No. No.
[27:13] There is no need for this formality.
[27:14] After all, I just came here
because Rania asked me.
[27:18] As far as tea is concerned,
we will have it on the way.
[27:22] This way we will have an outing too.
Shall we go, Rania?
[27:24] Yes.
[27:26] Shall we.
Lets go.
[27:28] Come on. Take care.
[27:32] They had to go for an outing and
they used me as the excuse.
[27:39] Why does this happen with me?
[27:54] Yes, sir?
[27:55] Two special tea.
[27:57] Okay.
Please.
[27:58] The tea here is really famous,
[28:01] if you want anything else,
I can get that too.
[28:04] Can I get poison?
Will you eat it here or at home?
[28:08] Very funny.
[28:10] You were fine like you were earlier,
annoyed and ill-mannered.
[28:16] You are the one who taught me to laugh.
[28:18] Yes, I was mad.
[28:22] But right now fix your mind.
[28:25] Please, fix your mood,
your family is coming over, what will they think?
[28:29] that we have kept you sad.
[28:31] Right now I am really angry.
[28:36] Did you see?
[28:37] Did you see how happily
he was talking to them
[28:40] and as soon as I went he closed his eyes
and lied down like he was unwell.
[28:44] He couldn’t wait for me to leave
and his party time would start.
[28:48] How many times will you
repeat the same thing,
[28:50] you have been saying this all the way,
stop it now.
[28:52] That cunning girl.
[28:54] Did you see how informal she was.
These people from America are really clever.
[28:59] I didn’t pay attention.
But I paid attention.
[29:05] Okay whoever she was,
whatever she was doing, why do you care?
[29:10] Yes, you are right.
[29:16] But I must have gotten insulted.
[29:18] Those people must be laughing at me
that I came running hearing the news.
[29:23] And Mahir too didn’t give me any attention.
[29:25] It is all that Salik’s fault,
he shouldn’t have told me.
[29:29] I am sorry, it is all your fault,
you shouldn’t have gone there.
[29:35] I am caring,
I cannot see anyone in pain.
[29:39] Now I will go if they tell me
he is unwell. What if?
[29:45] What if Mahir is staying there
for so long because of this?
[29:56] Yes, it is possible.
[30:01] The girl was really good.
[30:05] Yes, but maybe she was caring for him.
[30:29] Hey wow. Wow. Wow.
Where did the sun come out from today?
[30:32] A cap on your head?
Tasbeeh in your hands.
[30:34] Is everything fine, uncle?
I am praying. Praying.
[30:38] What is wrong, uncle?
Why do you look so worried?
[30:40] Is everything fine?
[30:41] Yes, Asma called, those people have
reached Lahore. I am worried.
[30:47] Yes, so what is there to worry in this?
[30:49] Mian Jee is not a gang and
they have not come to rob Lahore.
[30:52] Talk with respect,
he is my future father in law.
[30:55] Father in law? Yes. When did that happen?
[30:58] Lets imagine that your future
father in law and his son fail you, then?
[31:04] Scare me. you too scare me.
[31:06] Your mama is doing this well
with me for a few days.
[31:10] No, you too scare me. Scare me.
[31:11] Hey, I am not scaring you uncle,
I am trying to make you understand.
[31:14] Look, see, you should get a shock slowly.
[31:17] No, what do I lack?
I have biceps of metal, I look like Fawad.
[31:21] Chaudary? Yes, 
he too is a hero in his mother’s eyes. Okay?
[31:24] What do I lack?
I am one in a million. One is million.
[31:27] I will tell you what you lack.
[31:28] Hey you don’t walk with confidence,
what you say has no weightage,
[31:30] you have no money in your pocket,
and everything else is first class? Third class.
[31:33] Hey, I have a good job,
there is a good chance of promotion.
[31:36] Fine. Fine. it is good to be
mistaken a person stays happy.
[31:40] Mistaken?
I think I will concentrate on my prayers.
[31:44] Uncle, don’t worry. You are forgetting,
we have a soldier there.
[31:48] Yes. Rania.
[31:49] Yes. Rania will never let this mission fail.
[31:52] You are right, she will never step back.
[31:56] That girl will stand till the last moment.
[31:58] May God give her success. Ameen.
[32:01] You are right, uncle.
Right now Rania really needs prayers.
[32:05] I am praying for her.
[32:07] You do one thing,
get eleven different type of fruit,
[32:09] and make a doll out of dough,
[32:13] and pin lemon in its eyes,
[32:15] and then bury it in any such grave,
[32:17] who has died of corona virus.
[32:20] Okay. Where did you see this prayer?
[32:24] What is behind you? What is it?
[32:26] Oh God. God. God,
accept this prayer of mine.
[32:30] After this I wont any prayer after this.
this is the last one. The last one.
[32:38] Yes, Rania.
[32:40] Where is mama? Let me talk to her.
[32:42] Yes, yes, mama is right in front of me. here.
[32:44] Mama I am putting it on speaker,
you talk to Rania.
[32:46] Yes, give it.
[32:49] Hello child. Is brother there?
[32:51] No, he has not come yet.
[32:53] I called to say that Mahir left the home
and you took him out of your heart too.
[32:59] Have you forgotten his love, his affection,
[33:02] his great sacrifice and his great nature,
that you used to mention in front of everyone.
[33:07] Everything else is fine,
[33:09] but I don’t remember his great nature and sacrifice.
Which one was it?
[33:17] Oh, sorry, sorry,
I said too much out of emotion.
[33:20] Mama, Mahir is unwell.
[33:23] What?
[33:24] How?
He is unwell. What happened to him?
[33:26] Oh my poor son,
please take me to him as well.
[33:29] Yes, he is lying alone
at his friend’s home.
[33:31] Go and bring him somehow and
if he doesn’t come then, then pick him up.
[33:38] You did good that you told me.
I will go right now and bring him.
[33:41] But you know he is stubborn,
God knows if he will come or not.
[33:47] What is the issue? He will come here,
at least that witch aunt wont be there.
[33:52] Huh? What did you say, child?
I didn’t hear you.
[33:56] I am saying mama,
[33:58] just like I was living at his home,
[34:00] he too can live at my home.
It is the same thing.
[34:03] Yes, it is the same thing. Yes. Okay. Come on.
Come on, I will put the phone down.
[34:08] We will come with Mahir.
I will bring him and come. Okay bye.
[34:12] Here, hold your phone.
Come on, let’s go.
[34:14] I will go get my son,
I don’t know what condition he will be in.
[34:17] Mama, take me with you too.
If you go he will never come. You sit here.
[34:24] Mama, you will see,
I will act like a real mother.
[34:27] Doctor,
[34:28] why are you so worried?
I would say it is not right to go so deep.
[34:33] I would say that present
your case to Kali Baba,
[34:36] you will get success or
you can change my name.
[34:42] Okay? Tell me.
This issue is solved.
[34:46] What issue Rania?
[34:48] I told mama to bring her beloved home
and keep him home, take care of him.
[34:53] She has left him with strangers.
[34:55] Rania, you are thinking about Mahir,
you are scheming?
[35:01] Yes, so why should I not scheme?
[35:03] Did you see doctor,
how that girl was getting frank with Mahir?
[35:07] What is her relation with Mahir?
[35:09] Fine, I admit she is Salik’s cousin,
[35:11] but that doesn’t mean she stays
on Mahir’s head all the time.
[35:14] Rania, why are you acting like a crowd.
It is possible Mahir gave her permission himself.
[35:24] That’s not possible.
[35:25] Bless you.
[35:27] if you have some oranges then
your weakness will be removed.
[35:29] But till then lets check your fever.
Open up.
[35:31] No, no, I don’t have fever…Oh.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
[35:35] Close your mouth.
I don’t have fever.
[35:36] One minute.
I got hot soup for you. Drink it.
[35:39] You want that I drink hot soup
and my tongue burns.
[35:45] You guessed right.
[35:47] That’s what I want.
[35:48] This tongue of your that always shoots flames,
it is necessary to shut it up. Now drink it.
[35:56] Why are you always in such a bad mood?
Is there a problem? Oh!
[36:01] He has a really sad story.
[36:04] Shut up Salik, don’t speak any nonsense.
[36:06] See. Did you see how
he has hidden his sorrow.
[36:11] He doesn’t want that
his story becomes famous.
[36:15] He is a deep man.
[36:17] You…
Still I should find out something.
[36:19] Hey, I will tell you.
