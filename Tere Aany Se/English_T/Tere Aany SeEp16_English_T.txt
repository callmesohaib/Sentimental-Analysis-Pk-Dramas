[00:16] I always wished my sister-in-law
to be humorous,
[00:21] and what a joke you've made, slippers.
[00:25] I admire your sense of humor.
[00:27] Hey brother-in-law, why are you quiet?
[00:29] You can also chip in, I won't mind.
[00:33] Wow,
[00:36] today you changed your skin
just like a snake.
[00:40] We used to think you don't even
have a tongue in that mouth.
[00:45] Earlier you were my brother's in-laws,
[00:47] now that you're my in-laws as well,
I feel like a family.
[00:52] You know,
my confidence level increased.
[00:55] Rania, tell him why we are here.
[00:59] What?
[01:01] Say no to this relationship.
[01:04] What are you saying?
[01:05] See, I'm not liking your jokes anymore.
[01:08] And we are not liking this relationship.
[01:11] We can't marry off Rabail to some lizard.
[01:14] See, grandmother chose me herself
for her granddaughter.
[01:17] Grandmother was wrong.
[01:19] And none of us can accept this.
[01:22] Say no to this.
[01:23] Excuse me.
Yes?
[01:25] See, my father isn't home,
nor my brother or sister-in-law.
[01:28] If they were here, they would have
gotten offended.
[01:31] Because respected people don't back off
once they establish a relationship.
[01:34] Respected my.
[01:37] It's a compulsion.
[01:39] They are compelled to.
[01:42] Do we not know how stupid and illogical
traditions, respected families have?
[01:52] And they sacrifice their
whole lives after it.
[01:56] Who could understand it
better than you?
[01:58] Mahir, tell him.
[02:01] Yes, she's right.
[02:03] What's right?
[02:05] For God's sake Khawar.
[02:07] I called you my brother,
consider that at least.
[02:13] Aren't you my sweet brother?
[02:15] How happy I was to see you
both here.
[02:18] Little did I know,
you're here to kill my dreams.
[02:22] Okay, even if I say no,
[02:24] do you know what my father
would do to me?
[02:27] And grandmother? God forbid.
[02:30] I'm sorry I won't even be able
to bear her reactions.
[02:33] Listen to me,
[02:35] main character of national geographic.
[02:39] If you won't be able
to bear her reactions?
[02:43] Then get ready to bear my reactions.
[02:45] Leave him.
Mahir.
[02:47] Leave me.
Leave him.
[02:49] Let go.
Let go.
[02:54] Hey, Khawar,
[02:56] you only have a few days,
think about it.
[02:59] We'll visit again soon, and next time,
it won't be so pleasant,
[03:02] hope you understand.
[03:06] Think about it.
Let's go Mahir.
[03:09] Let's go.
[03:27] You used to seem very brave,
[03:30] that's how easily
you're giving up?
[03:32] I'm not giving up,
I'll go again,
[03:34] I'll go again and again,
till he agrees.
[03:36] Just keep doing as I say.
[03:40] This is how bad my time is,
[03:43] I have to play according
to her plans.
[03:47] I'm so stressed,
don't want to go home.
[03:50] Can we go on a long drive? We'll feel
better in a fresh environment.
[03:56] She's in her own games,
[03:58] wants to spend more time with me.
[04:04] She's falling for me.
[04:21] You've won my heart
by supporting Rabail.
[04:25] I don't know how I included you
in my plan.
[04:29] Idea.
[04:30] Why don't you get married
instead of Rabail?
[04:33] Grandmother's attention will be
diverted to you.
[04:35] And Rabail will be spared.
[04:37] That's an amazing idea,
why didn't I think of it earlier?
[04:40] I'd need a girl to get married,
[04:43] do you have someone
in your mind?
[04:45] Yes, I do.
[04:48] Now she’ll take her name.
[04:52] Clever girl
[04:56] If it's like this,
then tell me her name.
[04:59] No, no, no, don't be shy.
[05:00] If you've started the conversation
then complete it.
[05:02] Say her name.
[05:04] The one and only, Mona.
[05:07] You can marry Mona,
Mona is such a nice girl.
[05:10] And do you know,
she likes you too.
[05:12] You will be really happy
for the rest of your life.
[05:16] Wedding.
[05:39] Girls have a weird psyche.
[05:41] If they love someone, they get mad
at him and they ignore him.
[05:45] She talks a lot,
it’s all so strange.
[05:51] The weather outside is really nice,
[05:53] such a refreshing breeze.
[05:54] Let's go to the lawn?
I'll even make tea for you.
[06:00] Okay,
[06:01] you want me to come
to lawn with you?
[06:05] Yes,
[06:08] let's go?
[06:10] Now even your friends are
getting married.
[06:13] And Salik and Ifrah are
so happy together.
[06:17] Randomly, I was thinking
[06:22] don't give your family
the similar happiness as well?
[06:31] Mona, you can marry Mona,
she likes you too.
[06:36] You will be really happy
for the rest of your life.
[06:38] Wedding.
[06:40] Hot and delicious coffee
for my brother.
[06:46] Come on Mahir, hurry,
it's still hot.
[06:51] The assumptions we make
about girls Salik.
[06:55] That if you're rude to a girl,
she'll love you.
[06:59] If you ignore her,
she'll come after you.
[07:02] If you show her attitude,
she'll fall for you.
[07:06] All these assumptions are a lie,
false and fake.
[07:10] What happened?
Let me know.
[07:11] Whatever they show
in the films is fake.
[07:15] Nothing like that happens
in real life.
[07:17] Sounds like a good story,
tell me all the details.
[07:19] Let it go.
[07:20] I am really angry right now.
[07:23] Don't say anything to me.
[07:25] "Good story".
[07:26] Seems like you just got insulted
by a beautiful woman.
[07:30] Well all of that wasn't wrong.
[07:31] It's an exceptional case that
you got a difficult woman.
[07:38] Who was it?
[07:40] No one.
[07:42] And nobody can insult me.
[07:45] Mahir.
[08:16] I was thinking
she is impressed by me.
[08:19] But it's nothing like that.
[08:21] She's asking me to marry Mona.
[08:24] That means she has no feelings
for me in her heart.
[08:56] Hello?
[08:57] Hello? Rania, I'm Anjum.
Staff Anjum, from the hospital.
[09:02] Oh, sister Anjum,
how are you?
[09:04] Rania, Mahir got into an accident,
he's at our hospital.
[09:08] What?
[09:12] How? Is he alright?
[09:14] They just brought him here, I can't say
anything about his condition.
[09:17] Please come fast.
[09:19] Okay, we're coming.
[09:21] Damn, that's what happens
when you order online.
[09:24] I ordered golden they delivered silver.
[09:26] Uncle.
[09:27] Come on in Rania.
Uncle, uncle.
[09:30] Hey?
He's sleeping.
[09:32] Aunt, aunt,
where are the keys to his bike?
[09:35] It's there.
[09:37] What happened?
Why do you seem so worried?
[09:39] Mahir got into an accident.
[09:40] I am going to the hospital,
you wake him up.
[09:42] I don't know in what condition
he must be.
[09:44] Oh God, mercy.
Hammad, wake up.
[09:47] Hammad,
[09:49] Hammad,
[09:50] Hammad.
Wake up.
[09:52] What happened?
[09:54] Now one can't even sleep
peacefully in this house?
[09:57] Mahir got into an accident,
he is at the hospital.
[10:01] Wake up, wake up fast.
[10:03] When? How?
Where?
[10:05] Are you going to ask
for all the information here
[10:07] or do you want to go to the hospital?
[10:08] Wake up fast.
[10:11] Open your eyes,
it's an emergency.
[10:14] Here are your slippers,
what happened?
[10:17] Oh God, wear your slippers.
[10:21] Oh God, go now.
[10:27] My poor Mona, she got affected
by the evil eye.
[10:30] What do I do?
Nail paint hasn't dried yet.
[10:37] Nurse, it hurts really bad.
[10:41] I can feel at least one of my bones
is definitely fractured.
[10:44] You people didn't examine correctly.
[10:46] Check again,
[10:47] I'm saying check again
there must be a fracture.
[10:50] You're all right, just some minor injuries.
[10:52] You'll be perfectly fine
in a few days.
[10:54] Nothing happened, stay calm,
new brother-in-law.
[10:57] What?
[10:59] Brother-in-law?
[11:00] Who is brother-in-law,
whose brother-in-law?
[11:02] I'm not a new brother-in-law,
don't hurt me more by calling me that.
[11:06] You're so funny, still joking
in such a condition, wow.
[11:11] I've called your woman, she must be
flying to the hospital.
[11:15] Who did you call?
That Rania?
[11:44] My pain isn't getting any better.
[11:47] I think the painkiller
you're giving me is fake.
[11:52] This whole hospital is useless.
[11:53] All of you should put a lock
on this hospital.
[11:57] Really?
Then let me do something,
[11:59] I will give you an injection,
that too a big one.
[12:02] What?
[12:04] No, no, no, no,
I don't want an injection.
[12:06] I'll see who dares give me
an injection.
[12:09] That's our job,
let me call the male nurse,
[12:12] he'll easily give you an injection,
calmly.
[12:15] You won't even feel it,
honestly.
[12:17] No, no, hey nurse, listen.
[12:19] I don't want an injection.
Nurse.
[12:21] I don't know what hospital is this.
[12:23] My leg is already hurting
[12:26] and now they want it to hurt even more
by giving an injection.
[12:42] Hello? Send 2 male nurses.
[12:45] Yes, yes, they're needed.
Fast.
[12:48] Sister Anjum.
[12:49] Don't give me any bad news.
[12:51] Oh God, this yearning is called love.
[12:56] Calm down,
nothing happened to your hero.
[12:58] Just some minor injuries.
[13:00] But I don't know why he is yelling
at us lying on the bed.
[13:03] What? Minor injuries?
[13:06] That means it wasn't a
major accident?
[13:09] So I came here in such
a hurry for no reason?
[13:12] I got saved from several accidents.
[13:15] This spoiled man must be driving rash,
[13:18] why won't he get into an accident?
[13:19] His mind is always on the 7th skies,
[13:22] seems like that's exactly
where he wants to go.
[13:25] Where is he resting now?
[13:26] First room on the first floor,
go and meet your lover.
[13:34] Yes Salik,
what's in it for the biker,
[13:36] he swayed away.
[13:39] My car collided,
it was a big loss.
[13:43] And on top of that
I'm at the hospital.
[13:49] You?
[13:51] You, how did you come so fast?
[13:54] Not my fault,
[13:55] sister Anjum described the crisis
in such a way that I came like a hurricane.
[13:59] But you are quite alright.
[14:01] All my tension and worries are wasted.
[14:04] Oh, that's so bad.
[14:06] Nurse should have given you the news of
my death considering your tension and worries.
[14:11] And why are you even here?
[14:13] I don't even need your help.
[14:15] Go away.
You're absolutely right,
[14:17] people like you do not deserve help,
they deserve a punishment.
[14:20] What records for the speed did you
want to make, with your big car?
[14:24] You think of poor people as a bug.
[14:26] Disgusting.
[14:28] Tell me,
[14:29] what has happened to the poor child
you ran over with your car?
[14:34] Oh God, who knows how many families suffered
the death of their beloved due to this cruel person?
[14:37] Oh, brake, brake, hit the brakes.
[14:40] Nothing happened to him,
he went away swaying his bike.
[14:42] My car crashed,
my leg is hurt
[14:45] and it seems like you got
an injury to your brain.
[14:47] Staff, patients have some rights.
[14:49] I don't want to see this girl,
take her away.
[14:53] Aww, true love must be like this.
[14:56] See how he forgot his own pain
over your worries.
[15:00] He can't see you sad that's why
he's asking you to go.
[15:03] Aww, you both will write the tale
of true love in this era.
[15:09] Before you came, he disturbed
the whole hospital with his screams,
[15:13] and look at him now.
[15:15] How he’s at peace quietly, for you,
just for you Rania.
[15:19] Well I brought this injection
[15:22] but I don’t think he needs it anymore.
[15:24] But I’m right outside if needed.
[15:33] What were you thinking?
[15:35] What worlds did you want to explore?
[15:37] If grandmother finds out
she’ll lose her mind.
[15:41] And uncle Dabeer?
[15:42] How worried he’d be
in a foreign country.
[15:44] And that Mona would be
worried the most.
[15:47] I think she might’ve fainted
after hearing the news by now.
[15:51] She’d be having seizures.
[15:53] Are you going back with respect?
[15:55] Or do I call the doctor
to get you banned?
[15:57] Get me banned,
[15:59] but let me check first did you even get injured
or all this chaos is for no reason?
[16:04] Doctor.
[16:07] I was already in so much pain
and then you.
[16:26] Grandmother,
[16:28] Oh my child,
what happened?
[16:30] Do you need help?
[16:31] Get away.
[16:32] May God forgive us,
[16:33] not even an enemy would need
your help.
[16:36] What happened brother?
[16:38] How are you?
Slowly.
[16:42] Grandmother,
my foot hurts really bad.
[16:46] Careful.
[16:48] Give charity in his name.
She’ll fall.
[16:52] Here, take this strong shoulder.
[16:53] I am unable to walk.
Careful, careful, careful, careful.
[16:55] Uncle.
[16:58] Shehenshah, go lift him.
Shehenshah, go.
[17:00] Go help him.
Hold his hand.
[17:02] I can’t walk, aunt please give me
some support.
[17:04] Thousands of thanks to God,
it wasn’t a fracture.
[17:07] Oh God, what are you saying?
Thankfully his leg is fine.
[17:12] It’s very painful.
[17:13] Oh God, whose evil eye affected
my happy and thriving household?
[17:18] What accident happened
to my prince?
[17:21] Look at him,
his complexion is pale as yellow.
[17:25] Mother, no.
[17:27] I think Tipu hit Mano again.
Tipu, hold on a minute.
[17:30] That chaos doesn’t end.
[17:32] Grandmother, pray for me.
Praying.
[17:36] Although he does not need my help.
[17:39] But I have taken it on me to make his
pale complexion back to normal again.
[17:42] See, I made such a healthy soup,
it’s a crab soup.
[17:46] Only the fortunate ones get
to have a soup made by me.
[17:49] Come one, hurry up,
Open your mouth fast, good job.
[17:52] No, no, I don’t want any soup, any crab.
I’m feeling better than before.
[17:55] I don’t want it, go.
[17:57] If you don’t take the soup, how will you
take the medicines you innocent?
[18:00] You have to have the soup.
Good job my child.
[18:02] No, no, no.
I’m not going to have this soup.
[18:04] What did you say?
You won’t, have it?
[18:06] No.
You have to.
[18:08] Or I’ll ask uncle Hammad and Shahenshah to hold
your nose opens your mouth and pour all of it.
[18:13] What is this behavior?
[18:15] Good, that’s like a good boy,
good job.
[18:19] Come on, open your mouth again.
[18:20] What is this? How I’m stuck
in this trouble?
[18:23] Have it, have it my child.
I don’t want this soup.
[18:25] Should I take their help?
[18:27] Open your mouth,
open your mouth.
[18:29] Good, good job.
[18:32] Don’t worry all your bones are saved,
[18:35] your eyes and ears are fine.
[18:37] Just take a rest and you will be fine.
[18:38] And decrease your overacting,
it’s very obvious.
[18:41] Mona will be here,
she’ll take care of you.
[18:44] She’ll engage you in sweet conversations
and then everything will be alright.
[18:47] I don’t want to listen
to anything sweet
[18:49] There is no need
for anyone to come,
[18:50] I am already telling you,
uncle say no to that Mona.
[18:53] Hey, that’s the way to talk?
[18:55] That poor girl is taking out some time
from her busy routine
[18:59] to give company to someone
as boring as you.
[19:01] And you’re not done
with your tantrums.
[19:03] Okay now get straight,
[19:04] it’s time for your medicine,
we’ll take medicine.
[19:05] You can go from here,
I can take my medicine.
[19:07] My hands and legs are fine.
[19:09] No, no, no, no, uncle Hammad,
don’t listen to him.
[19:13] Psychopaths like him throw away
their medicines to elongate their illnesses.
[19:16] So they could get attention
from the people.
[19:18] He’ll have to take medicines
in front of us.
[19:20] To hell with you.
[19:21] Why would I do that uncle?
Shehenshah, hold his hands.
[19:24] Hey, don’t even get close to me.
[19:25] Come on.
I’ll not give you the salary for the month.
[19:27] Get away, go away.
[19:32] Good job.
[19:34] God is sufficient.
It’s so bitter,
[19:36] what illness is it going to cure?
[19:38] Ruined my taste buds.
[19:40] He got the energy.
[19:41] Get sweets for me.
Next medicine.
[19:43] Next medicine?
That’s important.
[19:44] I’m not sick.
[19:46] No, I, I, I, I feel better.
[19:47] I’m feeling better.
[19:49] I feel like I’m fine.
[19:59] Pack this one.
[20:01] For how much?
2,500/-
[20:03] What? 2,500?
[20:08] No then, leave this one.
[20:11] Where is the small one?
[20:13] Tell me about this?
[20:14] Pack this one, this one is nice.
[20:15] This will be 2,450/- for you my sister.
[20:18] 2,450 rupees? Are you.
[20:21] What happened?
[20:24] Be considerate of a sister.
I need to give this to a patient.
[20:26] Sister, 2,450/- is the least I’m willing to go,
not more than that.
[20:29] Oh God, you’re looting people.
[20:32] I can get a pair of sandals
for the same.
[20:34] Then do one thing, buy sandals
and give it to the patient.
[20:37] Shut up,
[20:38] I don’t like excessive joking,
especially from you.
[20:48] How much for this?
[20:50] Sister, this is for 500/-.
What? This is also for 500?
[20:53] I’m not going to pay anything
more than 100/- for this.
[20:56] And if that Rania hadn’t insisted,
I wouldn’t have wasted this 100/- either.
[20:59] Take this.
[21:01] Sister, 100/-?
Shut up, okay bye.
[21:25] You?
What are you doing here?
[21:28] Thank God,
you’ve escaped death.
[21:31] Or our future planning would’ve
been left incomplete.
[21:35] If I’ve escaped,
then let me escape.
[21:39] Why are you here to terrify me
in this black dress?
[21:44] I understand well,
[21:46] you’re angry at me, right?
[21:47] That I came to meet you too late?
[21:51] Actually, I went to get a flower.
[21:53] Rania told me to get a flower.
[21:55] So much of my time was consumed
in bargaining.
[21:58] God forgive us all, things to leave
on graves have also gotten expensive.
[22:02] But I still bought one for you.
[22:10] Yellow flower?
[22:12] Does that mean you want me
to stay sick like this forever?
[22:19] Oh God, when did I say that?
I really don’t want it.
[22:22] This was the cheapest
so I got this one.
[22:30] What did you do?
[22:31] He agreed on 100
after such a long argument.
[22:34] If you didn’t want one
you could’ve told me,
[22:36] I would’ve had ice cream
for 100 rupees.
[22:38] I already have a headache,
[22:40] do not make it worse
with your voice.
[22:42] And go away, go.
Okay I’ll be quiet.
[22:46] Okay listen.
[22:47] Oh man, leave me alone.
Please, please, please, go away.
[22:51] Please.
Okay then I’ll sit outside,
[22:53] call me if you need anything.
[22:54] Bye.
[23:04] Are you asleep or awake?
You’re awake.
[23:08] Now why are you here?
[23:09] I told you,
[23:11] I really don’t need this
efficiency of yours.
[23:14] Please leave me alone
for a while, please.
[23:16] I know, I know, I know that you want
to see Mona in place of me?
[23:20] No problem, have these fruits,
I’ll call her in a minute.
[23:24] Oh hello, hello, hello?
[23:26] Please, there is no need
to call anyone.
[23:28] I am okay, I am fit and fine.
[23:29] You are getting shy?
Why are you hiding it from me?
[23:32] I know everything,
[23:33] Mona told me all about
your love story with her.
[23:36] I made Mona my sister,
which makes you my brother-in-law.
[23:41] And brother-in-law and
sister-in-law can joke, right?
[23:44] It’ll be fun,
just wait for 2 minutes,
[23:46] I’ll get her right away.
[23:47] Hey, hey, hey? Listen, listen.
There is no need to call her. Listen.
[23:53] God, why is it happening to me?
[24:01] Hello?
[24:03] Hey, Shehenshah, is it you?
[24:05] Can you not hear me?
[24:08] Yes, tell me if everything is fine at home?
Everything alright?
[24:12] Where is everyone? Where is the mother?
Where is Mahir?
[24:15] Master, Thank God, but brother Mahir
got into an accident.
[24:20] But don’t worry,
don’t get tensed,
[24:22] God blessed him
with another life.
[24:25] What are you saying?
What nonsense?
[24:28] Are you informed right?
[24:30] Where is my Mahir?
Did he get severely injured?
[24:33] Yes but when he’s in pain I look after him,
I massage his legs sometimes.
[24:41] Oh God, Thank God.
[24:43] Thank you God that
you saved my son.
[24:46] You saved my centipede.
[24:48] Why are you not letting me talk to him?
Let me talk to him.
[24:52] That.
[24:55] Rash driving,
the arrogance of big cars.
[24:59] When they drive like the road
is their father’s property,
[25:02] that’s exactly what the results will be.
[25:04] Thank God that he’s saved.
[25:07] But let your pampered child know
that fate isn’t always so kind.
[25:11] Well, his condition is fine now.
[25:14] Just screams here and
there to get attention.
[25:16] But listen to me,
you really need to scold him.
[25:20] Let him know to drive like a human.
[25:23] He’s a human,
[25:26] but I’ll tell him to drive carefully.
[25:28] Okay then I will go inside and
let you talk to him on a video call.
[25:31] And get a firm tone in your accent.
[25:35] Bye.
[25:42] Why don’t you clearly tell grandmother?
[25:45] Why can’t you tell her that you do not
want to marry Khawar? Simple.
[25:49] It won’t matter if I talk to her or not.
[25:52] Grandmother thinks that she has made
the best decision in the world for me.
[25:57] But that’s plain cruelty, and we should
protest against this cruelty.
[26:02] We can’t do anything now.
[26:03] Now only Rania can do something.
[26:06] She is our only support and
she has told me to believe in her,
[26:09] that she will make everything right.
And also,
[26:12] brother Mahir is strictly against
this relationship.
[26:15] So why can’t he do anything?
[26:18] He pretends to be smart all the time.
[26:20] Yes he might have done something
but he got into an accident.
[26:26] Yes, okay, okay.
[26:29] Listen, I’ve talked to my mother about you.
[26:33] And thank God, she has finally decided
to make you her daughter-in-law.
[26:38] We are just waiting for you.
[26:40] I’ll bring my family
whenever you ask me to.
[26:42] To ask for your hand in marriage.
No, no. Not yet.
[26:46] Let Rania come up with a solution first.
Then bring your family, not before that.
[26:53] Okay, bye.
[26:55] Bye.
[27:10] Your father called,
[27:13] he wants to talk to you.
Here, talk to him.
[27:18] Hello father?
[27:20] How are you father?
[27:21] Many congratulations to you,
[27:24] it’s all a result of your prayers
[27:26] that your son is sitting here alive
and well.
[27:29] Father, it was a narrow escape.
[27:31] My foot?
Look at it father,
[27:33] look at the swelling,
look here at the side,
[27:37] see.
It hurts a lot.
[27:40] That’s exactly what should’ve
happened to you.
[27:43] Yes, did your brain get
into the right place
[27:46] or you’ll do the same things
after getting out of the bed?
[27:51] What do you mean?
[27:52] What do you mean
by what do you mean?
[27:54] Why were you in a hurry?
Why was there a need to do rash driving?
[27:59] Did you give time to somebody
that you had to reach there then?
[28:03] You can’t drive calmly?
[28:05] Who told you that?
[28:07] Who told me that?
[28:09] I still have a lot of well-wishers in that house,
true well-wishers
[28:16] So what do you think?
I get all the updates.
[28:19] These true well-wishers of yours
just appeared a while back?
[28:22] If you keep believing in them,
then I,
[28:25] your own son will be soon
standing outside the house.
[28:28] Oh stop it, don’t be dramatic.
[28:31] You’re acting.
[28:33] Why are you on the bed like girls?
[28:39] You’ve defamed me.
[28:42] Be a man, be a man, and get up.
[28:45] Lying on the bed.
[28:47] I didn’t expect this from your father.
[28:49] Bye.
[28:51] What?
[28:52] Here you go, crying over the facts.
[29:00] 100 witches must’ve died
to make a place for you.
[29:05] There is a limit to being a snitch.
[29:08] You were the one to tell all of this
to my father?
[29:11] Yes, I told him.
[29:13] You enjoy here and your poor fathers
get worried there.
[29:18] That’s why I told him what’s the truth,
what’s wrong with that?
[29:20] Oh, how can you ever be wrong?
[29:22] We are wrong,
you are always right.
[29:25] Thank God at least you get it now.
[29:33] Let me recover first,
[29:35] then I’ll tell you what Mahir Ahmed is.
[29:39] To this day no girl has ignored me,
[29:42] and her attitude isn’t getting any better.
[29:44] Wants me to get with that Mona?
[29:48] If I couldn’t make you fall in love,
[29:51] then my name isn’t Mahir Ahmed.
[29:55] Challenge accepted.
[30:11] Thank God, brother Mahir is better now.
[30:13] I got really scared when
I heard about his accident.
[30:20] Sister is he getting the right treatment?
[30:24] You shouldn’t have brought him home
so soon.
[30:30] You could have told me,
[30:31] I would’ve taken him to
an expensive hospital.
[30:34] He would be more comfortable there
than at his home.
[30:39] Listen to me, we could have also
taken him to an expensive hospital,
[30:43] we're never short of money here.
[30:48] But the doctor himself told us
that his injuries are not that deep,
[30:54] so why do you want to keep him
on the hospital? Right?
[31:02] Uncle, Mahir is perfectly fine,
[31:05] he'd be running like a horse
in a few days.
[31:07] Yes, if God wills.
[31:09] Sister Saman, can I have you
for a moment?
[31:11] I need to talk to you
about something important.
[31:25] Well sister,
[31:27] I've bought shares at a hospital,
[31:30] you could've taken him
to that hospital.
[31:32] They'd all be at your service,
he'd have fun.
[31:40] Is your mind in the right place?
[31:43] They have already committed
[31:44] Whatever you are saying,
considered it impossible.
[31:46] I do not want to marry him,
have you looked at his face?
[31:49] He looks like an alien.
I don't want to get married.
[31:54] Have you heard what kind
of names she is calling him?
[31:56] How will she ever respect him
as a husband?
[31:58] Your brother-in-law's life will be ruined.
[32:00] Yes.
[32:01] Grandmother has already given her word.
She won't change that,
[32:04] it's against her principles.
[32:06] That's why I am telling you,
[32:08] pressurize your brother-in-law.
[32:12] Tell him to say no or
it won't be good for him.
[32:16] Shehenshah,
go get Khawar a little, fast.
[32:19] Why should I get only a little of Khawar?
I should get him whole.
[32:22] Okay, go get him fast.
[32:23] You are not doing right
with my brother-in-law.
[32:25] Look at her, still thinking
about her brother-in-law,
[32:27] doesn't care about her sister.
[32:28] I won't get engaged to that dumb head.
Take him away from here.
[32:31] Rabail, you're speaking a lot,
along with your excessive thinking.
[32:35] Shehenshah,
[32:38] since I got injured,
you've stopped listening to me.
[32:41] I've been calling you for so long.
[32:43] Mr. Injured, you arrived
at the right moment.
[32:45] I think we should settle the matter
between Rabail and Khawar.
[32:51] Okay?
Come have a seat here.
[32:53] Come on.
[32:56] Bring me a glass of water,
I'm thirsty.
[32:58] Mr. Khawar, come,
take a seat.
[33:09] Yes so Mr. Khawar,
what did you think,
[33:12] when are you going to say no to
this relationship with Rabail?
[33:15] See, it's not as easy.
[33:19] That's what I am saying,
[33:21] the elders decided to form
this relationship.
[33:23] And their decisions are like
a carving on a stone.
[33:26] I don't understand this,
[33:28] what is this obsession our family has,
[33:30] they carve on every stone.
[33:33] Listen to me, hurry up and decide
[33:35] when are you going to say no?
[33:38] Brother, what can I say?
[33:40] You are not as innocent
as you pretend to be.
[33:43] See grandmother's taunts,
father's beating will be on my side
[33:46] and brother Arbab will get angry as well,
I can't say no.
[33:50] Please understand.
[33:52] Okay so, imagine, just imagine.
[33:56] At the exact time of engagement,
[33:58] a woman enters the venue
with a child.
[34:03] And as she enters, she announces
that she is your wife.
[34:08] And you're the father of that child.
[34:11] Then imagine
[34:13] how much you'll get beaten up
from all 4 sides.
[34:16] Imagine, and count the beating.
[34:19] And your picture will be printed
in the newspaper.
[34:24] It'll be so much fun.
[34:26] People love to hear
about spicy rumors,
[34:29] and they spread the word as well.
[34:31] I accept, whatever you'll say I accept.
[34:35] I'll say no but I really care
about my honor.
[34:37] I knew it, my sweet brother
will definitely do as I say.
[34:41] I'll sacrifice my life for you,
[34:42] you've respected the word of your sister.
[34:45] Now go inside and enjoy a free party,
[34:46] grandmother has made really good
arrangements to show off her greatness.
[34:50] Eat as much as you want.
And listen,
[34:52] when you’re done eating,
stand firm
[34:55] and just say no in front of everyone,
okay?
[34:58] Go now, good luck.
[35:01] Oh my brother-in-law.
[35:10] Why do you look upset?
Celebrate it, dance and sing.
[35:14] What happened?
We’ll get you ice cream later.
[35:17] That’s exactly how I look,
[35:19] and I’m not interested in playing music
nor in eating.
[35:23] Your wish, we’ll definitely go.
[35:26] I am only tolerating you
because of Rabail.
[35:30] Cheap girl.
[35:36] And we have to go inside and
look like we’re enjoying.
[35:40] Because grandmother would know
looking at your sobbing face.
[35:43] And yes,
[35:44] Farhad has to look the happiest
at this event,
[35:47] so nobody would doubt.
Do you understand?
[35:52] You’re really nice.
[35:53] Thank God, it happened.
[36:01] I’m getting more scared now.
[36:04] What if that Khawar refused
to do that?
[36:07] I’ll have to marry him?
[36:08] Nothing like that will happen,
calm down and have the ice cream.
[36:11] I’m here, I’ll manage everything.
[36:15] Hey, Doctor?
What are you doing here?
[36:18] Greetings.
Greetings.
[36:21] Why are you so surprised?
[36:24] Do you think all the doctors spend
their lives at the hospital?
[36:29] They shouldn’t have anything
to do with the outside world?
[36:34] Wow, you’re smiling a lot today,
also talking really sweet.
[36:39] Oh no, and to be honest,
[36:41] I’ve learned to smile from you.
[36:44] From me?
[36:47] How?
[36:48] Now I can casually talk to people,
[36:51] make casual conversations,
smile and laugh.
[36:54] You’ll learn everything in near future.
[36:56] Oh and they’ll be getting married soon,
you have to come, okay?
[37:00] Oh I didn’t introduce.
[37:02] This is Rabail, my cousin.
[37:03] And you’ve met Farhad,
[37:05] and you know Laiba very well
she was your patient.
[37:08] Laiba? How are you now?
[37:10] I’m perfectly fine.
[37:12] But I miss your scolding.
