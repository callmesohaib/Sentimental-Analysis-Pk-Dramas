[00:17] Brother Mahir,
do you like her just like us?
[00:20] What? Rania?
[00:22] Why would I like her?
She's a witch.
[00:26] I'm only taking her
so she could look after you.
[00:30] Well I don't understand
[00:32] how do you all enjoy her company,
she is so boring.
[00:37] No?
[00:38] Today will be so much fun.
[00:43] Tipu said you called me?
[00:45] What? I called you? Tipu.
[00:49] He's lying,
[00:51] the children were insisting
that we're going out
[00:53] so we should to take sister Rania as well,
I said okay, why not.
[00:56] Really?
[00:57] I also have to shop for
uncle Dabeer's room,
[01:01] so I'll shop as well.
[01:02] Also, should I change or it's okay?
[01:05] Change if you want to,
don't if you don't want,
[01:07] why does it matter?
[01:09] You won't get any attention among
the beautiful girls in this city.
[01:12] Right children?
[01:15] Children?
[01:16] You're underestimating me.
[01:18] You don't what Rania is.
[01:21] People use my example in the village.
[01:25] That means everyone in the village
is mad like you.
[01:29] Everyone only talks according
to their brain capacity.
[01:31] Let's go kids before he hears any more
appreciation from me.
[01:35] Yes?
[01:37] The cab is here, let's go.
[01:38] Yes, it’s the black gate.
[01:39] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, okay.
[01:50] Well, where are we going?
You tell, where do you want to go?
[01:53] I think, let's go to Dr. Wasiq's house.
[01:55] We have to invite him to
Mona's engagement as well.
[01:57] Yes sure, let's go.
[01:59] And after that, we'll go to
sister Anjum's place, okay?
[02:02] Yes.
[02:03] And then Khawar, it's been so long
since we met him.
[02:06] Oh yes, we have to meet him.
[02:09] We're going for a children's outing Rania,
[02:11] not for a meetup with your friends.
[02:13] And children will be really bored looking
at Dr. Wasiq's face.
[02:16] Right, kids?
[02:17] If you had to do what you wanted
then why'd you ask?
[02:19] Please forgive me,
I made a huge mistake.
[02:22] Children, you tell,
where do you want to go?
[02:25] Brother Mahir, let's go to the zoo.
[02:27] No, no. It'll get really late,
[02:29] I have to go shopping and
then I have to set uncle's room.
[02:32] Yes I think she is absolutely right,
[02:34] so let's do one thing,
we should go to the zoo.
[02:35] Yay.
[02:37] Oh God, what kind of useless people
I am stuck with.
[02:41] Your father is returning,
do you care about that?
[02:44] What kind of care,
you don't know my father,
[02:47] he is very decent and simple.
[02:51] He won't like a decorated room, relax.
[02:55] Right?
[02:57] Okay.
[02:58] I think he's like my grandfather.
[03:00] My grandfather is also very simple,
[03:02] he doesn't like to show off.
[03:04] Do you know,
[03:05] even the most influential people
in my city are scared of him, yes.
[03:09] Children, we'll go for ice cream
after the zoo.
[03:16] Don't do this now,
it'll get pretty late.
[03:19] Brother, drive fast, please.
[03:29] Mano, careful.
[03:32] Grandmother was telling me
about your father,
[03:37] that he is not alive anymore.
[03:40] Sorry,
[03:42] but what was he like?
[03:44] I'm sure you must've seen him.
[03:46] I didn't see him,
[03:48] I was very young when he died.
[03:51] Oh, you must remember
something about him.
[03:55] Hey, madam,
May god bless your pair,
[03:58] give charity in your love's name.
[04:00] What are you saying? Sorry,
we don't have any spare change.
[04:03] Madam, stay happy,
May God bless you with a lot,
[04:05] please give charity in his name.
[04:07] I'm telling you we don't have any,
please leave.
[04:09] Here you go, keep this money
[04:11] and remember us in your prayers.
[04:12] May God keep you both happy.
[04:14] Why did you give her any money?
She was healthy.
[04:17] We shouldn't be giving money
to such people.
[04:19] It's okay, she was giving
so many well-wishes,
[04:22] it made sense to pay her.
[04:24] You tell,
[04:26] how was your father?
[04:27] Yes, I don't really remember much.
[04:30] But yes, he was very educated,
he had a great job.
[04:34] And he was really handsome,
it seems like you're like him.
[04:37] Oh,
[04:38] so that means,
you're finally admitting
[04:42] that I am handsome after all.
[04:45] Yes, God did bless you with a nice face.
[04:48] Now I know what you are going
to say next,
[04:51] physical beauty does not matter,
[04:53] the real beauty is inner beauty, right?
[04:56] Absolutely, physical appearance
doesn't last,
[04:59] what matters is a person's morality
and his character.
[05:03] All of these sound really good on Facebook
status and forward messages.
[05:08] But in practical life.
Brother Mahir, brother Mahir,
[05:10] do you know I saw a white tiger there.
[05:13] Okay my child,
go forward there are more tigers.
[05:16] Come with me.
What are you doing?
[05:19] Come on.
Hey.
[05:21] I'm coming in a second.
Okay, now show, what is it?
[05:31] Oh.
[05:32] Are you blind? Can't you see?
[05:34] Oh, sorry, my eyes squinted looking
at your beautiful face.
[05:37] Really? Take off your glasses
it'll pop your eyes out.
[05:39] At least tell us your name.
[05:41] Tell us anything.
[05:42] Tell me your Instagram id?
[05:44] Give us your phone number?
[05:46] Do I give you my shoe number?
[05:47] Hey, she looks even cuter
when she's angry.
[05:49] Get lost.
[05:50] Don't you have any shame?
Hey, Mahir.
[05:53] Hey, sorry brother,
I was just joking.
[05:55] You are joking?
[05:56] Ask for forgiveness.
Sister.
[05:58] Ask for forgiveness.
Sister, sister please, I was kidding,
[06:00] I swear to God.
Mahir
[06:02] I swear to God I was joking sister.
Mahir, let him go.
[06:04] He's a goon.
I'll kill you, get lost from here.
[06:06] Mano.
[06:09] What happened?
The kids are worried.
[06:13] Sorry, I shouldn't have left you
alone like this.
[06:16] It's fine.
Are you okay?
[06:18] I'm okay.
[06:21] Where is Tipu?
[06:22] He's there.
[06:25] Let's go.
[06:34] Mother, I enjoyed it a lot,
it was too much fun.
[06:37] It looks like only you had fun,
[06:39] looking at him it seems like he had
to push the motorcycle to home.
[06:43] Mother didn't have to push
the motorcycle
[06:46] but I had to pull your daughter-in-law.
[06:49] She did not want to go back home.
[06:51] Oh mother, my back hurts mother,
I swear.
[06:55] Where is Mahir, he didn't return yet
with the children.
[06:58] Oh don't worry mother,
he will be back.
[07:01] Okay I wanted to talk about something
very important.
[07:03] Yes mother.
[07:04] Listen, did Mona agree or not?
[07:07] What if we do all the preparations and
then find out the girl doesn't agree?
[07:11] Absolutely not.
[07:13] What do you think mother,
this is possible?
[07:15] Why can't this be possible?
[07:17] She's your younger sister,
everything is possible.
[07:20] In fact, sometimes I get scared
she doesn't cause a scene like you.
[07:26] Listen,
[07:28] you are responsible for this relationship,
[07:30] do not embarrass me.
[07:31] Rafique shouldn't think we're taking
a revenge for saying no to Rabail.
[07:36] And also, get all the information
about Khawar,
[07:39] it's a matter of a girl's life.
[07:41] Mother, I am giving you my word,
[07:44] I made this decision very wisely and
Mona is more understanding than me.
[07:49] No matter how Khawar is,
she'll control him.
[07:52] She's not innocent and
naive like me.
[07:55] The kids have returned.
You got really late.
[08:00] Where were you, grandmother
was getting worried.
[08:02] Today we enjoyed a lot,
it was so much fun.
[08:05] We didn't notice the time passing,
enjoyed a lot.
[08:09] Kids did.
[08:11] Yes, they were enjoying so much.
[08:13] Okay, okay.
[08:14] Okay mother, we're tired
now we're going to sleep.
[08:17] Okay?
[08:18] Go, go. Good night.
Change your clothes.
[08:20] Grandmother, we're also tired,
we should also get fresh.
[08:23] Go, go to sleep and rest.
Good night.
[08:29] Listen, call Mona, and ask her.
[08:34] Also, did your brother and sister-in-law
approved of this?
[08:37] All of them agreed just the sister-in-law
as a little jealous type,
[08:42] already making excuses
of fake sickness.
[08:44] She got her gallbladder removed
10 years ago
[08:46] and now she is saying she is having
some pain in the gallbladder.
[08:48] I didn't think she'll allow brother.
[08:50] First I was really sad that brother and
sister-in-law won't be there.
[08:54] Then I thought, get lost,
I have my mother-in-law.
[08:58] If you made me a part of your family
then my sister is also part of your family,
[09:03] that's what respectable people do.
[09:05] Yes, yes.
[09:06] I'll go get my phone in 2 seconds
[09:09] and make you talk to Mona
on a video call.
[09:12] For your reassurance,
so you'd stop worrying.
[09:17] I pity poor Khawar, pity.
[09:20] Listen to me, we didn't force
this relationship,
[09:24] it was Khawar and his father's choice.
[09:28] And your wife,
[09:29] she wholeheartedly wanted her sister
to get married to him.
[09:34] So who are we to get
in between them?
[09:37] Khawar isn't less than anyone,
I'm telling you.
[09:40] Cunning people got more cunning people.
[09:42] Mother, I'm a little tired, can I go?
[09:47] Go, go away.
[09:50] He's always tired.
[09:53] Hey, this list doesn't have
Sarwat's name, we forgot.
[09:56] Yes what's the name of her husband?
Shahrukh.
[10:00] Oh no, the 3rd one.
[10:01] No, not Shahrukh, what was it?
[10:03] Fat something, no, Quddous.
[10:05] Oh no, 3rd.
[10:07] Yes, Shafeeq,
Shafeeq, yes.
[10:10] He'll die as well.
[10:11] What are you saying?
[10:12] Mother, write all of my friend's names,
I'll invite all of my friends.
[10:15] Oh no, they eat a lot,
don't invite them.
[10:17] No, they eat a lot less than
your friends.
[10:20] Remember mother, when brother
invited his friends over for Eid,
[10:23] they ate everything,
there was nothing left for us to eat.
[10:26] Stop it.
[10:27] You always start your
own fight everywhere.
[10:29] And here I am thinking
[10:31] mother married off her other
granddaughter in a very rich family
[10:35] that likes to show off,
[10:37] people will compare our things
and gifts with theirs.
[10:41] Then let them do it,
how does it matter to us,
[10:43] right uncle?
[10:44] What can I say, I have no experience
in such matters.
[10:47] Everyone is getting married one by one
and then there is me,
[10:52] my wedding flowers already withered,
already withered.
[10:56] Uncle, we were talking about
such positive things,
[10:59] couldn't you express your grief later?
[11:02] We get cold from your cold sighs.
[11:04] You didn't do good for me,
[11:05] there must be a lot of teachers at your school,
[11:07] some of them might be old,
some of them waiting to get married.
[11:11] You never tried to talk about
your uncle's proposal?
[11:13] How can you arrange
your son's wedding,
[11:16] when your brother, when your
biological brother isn't married yet?
[11:19] You are not thinking about me,
you are thinking about your son.
[11:21] Don't worry, don't get disheartened,
[11:24] I've talked to a lot of people,
you will definitely get married.
[11:26] Yes I will, one day definitely,
[11:29] when Farhad will be old and
his kids will be young.
[11:33] And then they'll make memes on me,
[11:35] they'll make memes on me with my wife.
[11:38] An old man getting married
to a young woman.
[11:41] And even the children
will make fun of me.
[11:43] They'll do cyber-attacks on me,
[11:45] they'll make videos on me for YouTube.
[11:47] What are you talking about?
[11:49] You are a little too far in the future,
[11:51] in present I am getting married,
it's my wedding.
[11:53] Focus on me.
[11:55] So mother, tell me about the list.
[11:56] I am just thinking if I leave someone out.
[11:59] Write another name,
Razia Saleem.
[12:03] She was my ex, and my boss's name.
[12:08] Now they have 3 children together.
[12:13] Visit whenever you want Rafique Ahmed,
this is like your own house.
[12:19] Keeping guests, is a tradition
of our family.
[12:23] We're respected people,
[12:25] we feel happy while inviting people
and feeding them.
[12:30] Yes.
[12:32] Oh no, no, no,
[12:34] I don't need anything,
everything is available here.
[12:38] Okay then bring it,
if you're insisting so much.
[12:42] You know those chocolates,
[12:45] the ones that have purple wrapping.
[12:49] Yes that one, bring that one only,
a kg or 2, nothing else.
[12:53] Yes.
[12:54] Okay then we're waiting for you.
[13:02] So, this is also settled.
[13:05] Yes?  Are you done with it?
Did you add the stitches to my shirt?
[13:09] Yes about to.
[13:11] What are you doing,
learning how to stitch?
[13:14] Yes, yes grandmother,
[13:16] I was learning how to stitch.
[13:24] Mother, mother.
Yes?
[13:28] Mona said yes.
[13:30] Thank God, she said yes.
[13:33] Listen, prepare some amazing tea,
[13:36] Mona's in-laws and her groom
are coming over,
[13:39] arrange tea for them.
[13:41] You gave a really good news.
[13:43] Mona has a small list of wishes that
she wants to give to Khawar.
[13:48] Yes, why not, it'll be her right.
[13:50] She should definitely give,
[13:51] when one gets so much money
they spent on their wives.
[13:54] I'll go and make tea.
Yes.
[13:57] Grandmother,
[13:58] hasn't Khawar been
visiting a lot lately?
[14:01] He has a right.
[14:03] Khawar is Mona's future husband,
[14:06] yet he has a right to this house.
[14:08] I am Mona's elder sister's husband,
[14:12] yet nobody recognized
my right in this house.
[14:17] Hammad, you don't use your arms or legs,
[14:20] but you have been using a lot of brains
to think about such things.
[14:27] Sorry, mother,
[14:29] sorry.
[14:32] Yes are you done?
Done with the stitch?
[14:35] Yes, stitched.
Grandmother it seems like it is joint.
[14:40] Yes, it is done.
[14:46] Here you go sister,
your chocolates.
[14:48] Rafique Ahmed,
thank you, thank you.
[14:52] Is the purple one there?
[14:54] Yes, yes, just saw it.
You brought so many.
[14:58] That's nothing, sister.
Aww, thank you.
[15:03] Where is Khawar?
[15:05] He went to park the car,
he'll be back soon.
[15:10] Here he comes.
[15:15] What happened to him?
[15:18] I think he sprinted his back,
why is he walking like that?
[15:22] Khawar my child,
why are you so stiff?
[15:25] It looks like you had a dip
in cold water.
[15:28] My son's body got stiff.
[15:30] No, grandmother there is
nothing like that.
[15:33] Only the ones who are rich and
powerful walk with this attitude.
[15:38] Father, you didn't tell them?
I did other deal on a property.
[15:42] Yes, yes.
[15:43] Congratulations Rafique Ahmed.
Congratulations.
[15:46] It would be a really fortunate girl
[15:48] who would come to my home
as my bride.
[15:51] He is not even a son-in-law yet,
are you seeing his arrogance?
[15:55] If he shows son-in-law's arrogance
[15:58] then we'll turn it to dust as in-laws.
[16:03] Do you want tea brother Khawar?
[16:05] There is no need for tea Rania,
[16:08] we should give him almond milk.
[16:11] So his eyesight could improve and
he gets rid of these glasses.
[16:16] You know about our Mona,
[16:18] when she gets mad,
she throws things around.
[16:22] And if he has weak eyesight,
[16:24] then things will hit him on the head
and he will get injured.
[16:27] Yes.
[16:28] Yes, I'm worried, what will happen to him
if he gets a head injury?
[16:33] This power, this way of life,
what will he do about it?
[16:36] Listen to me Mr. Mahir,
[16:38] I am about to get a LASIK surgery,
[16:40] it's just a matter of a few days and
then I will get rid of these glasses.
[16:42] Then you'll witness my attitude.
[16:44] And about catching things, I have joined
a very expensive sports club,
[16:49] I'll practice catching things from there.
[16:51] Sports club? Uncle,
[16:53] do they have another sports club
for dumb people?
[16:57] Maybe.
[16:58] Oh no, new times, new things.
[17:02] And new businesses are thriving
because of dumb people like him.
[17:12] Listen to me, I'm not dumb,
[17:14] I'm an innocent boy and girls
are dying for this Innocence.
[17:18] Well don't admire me so much,
[17:20] brother Mahir won't be able to process it.
[17:22] Father, tell them which hall did
we book for the engagement?
[17:25] Hey show off,
[17:27] first tell me are you here to
greet grandmother or to brag?
[17:32] Father, everyone respects
money nowadays,
[17:35] it is very necessary.
[17:37] Who could understand
better than you?
[17:39] And yes grandmother, I will choose
my own dress for the event.
[17:42] Actually I don't understand
everyone’s stitching style,
[17:46] so I have my personal tailor,
[17:48] he's a little expensive
but works according to me.
[17:52] You also have a choice.
[17:54] The tailor must be the first one
to take his choice into consideration.
[18:01] Father, look at them,
they are making fun of me.
[18:03] Look, brother-in-law,
you're at your in-laws
[18:05] so you'll get such treatment,
[18:09] brother Rafique do you have
any objections?
[18:11] No, no, my child I have no objection.
[18:13] It's your thing,
use it however you want.
[18:17] We also have to introduce you
to our friends, brother Khawar.
[18:20] Oh, then mentally prepare
yourself for that before,
[18:24] girls nowadays are very sharp,
[18:27] they ruin such boys.
[18:29] Father, father, what is he saying?
[18:34] Calmly, uncle.
[18:37] Don't insult our future son-in-law.
[18:40] Look at him, he looks like
he's about to cry.
[18:43] Oh, no, that's just
how he looks all the time.
[18:46] Brother Khawar, I would suggest
on the day of the wedding,
[18:50] hide your face with some accessories.
[18:53] Because we don't know what people
will say, looking at your face.
[18:57] Add fairy lights to
the accessories as well.
[19:00] It'll look really good.
Write Eid Mubarak as well.
[19:05] Father, are you listening,
to what they're saying?
[19:08] Enjoy my child,
[19:10] it's not easy to be a son-in-law,
[19:12] the family who's giving their daughter
also makes fun of you.
[19:16] See how lovingly
they're making fun of you.
[19:20] Love?
[19:22] Are you marrying or do I hit you?
[19:27] I'll marry.
[19:30] He's on track now.
[19:41] Mother your tea with jaggery.
[19:44] Live long, live long, live long.
[19:46] Listen to me, how many days
are left in the engagement,
[19:49] when will Mona arrive?
[19:51] I talked to her this morning,
[19:52] she's saying she'll reach
as soon as possible.
[19:54] Okay then, that's a good thing.
[19:58] Did you listen to
what Khawar had to say?
[20:01] They're spending money like crazy.
[20:04] So we will spend double
the amount of money.
[20:07] Yes we will grandmother, why not,
we’ll spend extravagantly.
[20:11] Yes, good job, you made me happy,
[20:14] I'm proud of you.
[20:17] Well grandmother, call your son
[20:20] and tell him,
[20:22] the dollars he earned
while being in America,
[20:26] when are we going to use them?
This is the time to show it off.
[20:31] Grandmother, that day when
I talked to him about dollars,
[20:33] he cut off the call,
talk to him about it.
[20:37] No, no, he'll give, why won't he?
I'll talk to him.
[20:41] Call him, I'll talk to him.
[20:43] Grandmother, what happened?
[20:45] We don't hurt ourselves if we look
at other people with a red faces.
[20:49] If they're doing, let them spend
extravagant amounts,
[20:51] but we shouldn't do that.
[20:53] Hey Rania, you don't understand.
[20:55] Grandmother, if she could, she'd ruin
our respect in front of them.
[20:59] Don't listen to her.
[21:01] Son, and daughter,
you can't understand all this.
[21:09] It's ringing.
Stay on call.
[21:13] Greetings brother Dabeer.
Greetings, father, hello?
[21:17] Here, talk to mother.
[21:19] Greetings.
Greetings, greetings.
[21:21] Tell me how are your preparations
to return? Have you booked a ticket?
[21:25] Mother, just assume
that I've gotten tickets,
[21:29] I'll be at your feet very soon.
[21:31] Here we have a competition
to show off wealth,
[21:35] we're in need of a lot of money.
Can't back off.
[21:39] Mother, businesses were
in a very bad place last year,
[21:46] conditions here are not good.
[21:48] You could go in loss,
it doesn't matter to me.
[21:50] The matter is escalated here.
[21:52] Your mother can't appear smaller
than Rafique, in front of people.
[21:56] Listen, when you return this time,
bring your wife as well, that sweetie,
[22:01] it's been 20 years and
we haven't seen her face.
[22:03] Mother, leave her, what am I going
to do by bringing her here?
[22:06] Are you kidding,
[22:08] she's my daughter-in-law,
and she hasn't shown her face yet.
[22:12] This time when you come,
bring sweetie with you
[22:15] because we are done playing hide
and seek, just bring her here.
[22:19] That, that, that.
[22:21] Mother I forgot to tell you sweetie
got into a major accident.
[22:28] Legs are fractured,
[22:30] the bones are broken
at multiple points,
[22:32] doctor advised her the bed rest
after giving her the plaster.
[22:37] She cannot get up from her bed
for 6 months mother.
[22:40] What? Did you hear that?
[22:43] Your mother's legs broke.
[22:46] How did it happen?
[22:47] Oh God, then it’s a compulsion.
[22:50] Okay then let me talk to her,
so I could ask about her condition.
[22:54] There is some disturbance in line,
we'll talk later.
[22:58] What happened?
What happened?
[23:00] The call ended.
What did you do?
[23:02] I didn't even touch.
[23:04] See, he disappeared.
[23:12] Uncle? What are you doing?
[23:14] Oh it's just water.
[23:17] I'm drinking it to only leave
a little remaining.
[23:18] So I could drown and die in it.
[23:22] Amazing,
[23:24] there is such a happy environment at home,
[23:25] your nephew is getting married and
you're sitting here in such a sad mood.
[23:29] You should've gotten a drum till now,
[23:31] it would've been entertaining,
we'd enjoy.
[23:33] Drums? You won't understand,
[23:35] nobody can understand.
[23:37] My 4 years younger,
3 and a quarter years younger nephew,
[23:42] first got engaged now getting married.
Do you know what people are going to say?
[23:44] Look, he is the same guy
[23:46] whose nephew got married,
but he's still single.
[23:51] But why am I telling all this to you,
[23:52] you cannot understand my feelings,
I can understand,
[23:56] I can absolutely understand,
[23:57] in fact, I am mad at myself I don't know
why did I not understand earlier,
[24:01] but don't worry now.
[24:03] Getting you married is
now my responsibility.
[24:06] See, don't forget.
[24:08] Is it even something to forget?
[24:10] I will get you married as many times
as you want.
[24:13] Okay now get up,
let's go inside,
[24:15] we should talk to them as well,
they don't care.
[24:19] Uncle is sitting outside like orphan.
[24:21] Come on, get up.
[24:23] Let's go.
[24:26] Come on, come on.
[24:27] Wonderful, nobody cared about uncle.
[24:33] I mean outside, he was lying outside,
drinking water
[24:36] and nobody was there
to ask him anything?
[24:39] What happened?
[24:40] What happened is that he should have
been married twice by now,
[24:44] he should have had 4 children by now.
[24:46] Listen to me,
[24:47] a nephew getting married before uncle?
Won’t you be embarrassed?
[24:50] No, no, why are you spoiling my plan?
Listen to me.
[24:53] What do I listen,
[24:55] your heart didn't say anything when
you were being cruel to this innocent man?
[24:59] Take a breath,
listen to me.
[25:01] I won't listen to anything,
you listen to me.
[25:03] Aunt? Aunt,
I'll call grandfather today,
[25:06] and tell him to tell
the women in the village
[25:09] to find a girl for uncle,
we want an urgent proposal, right now.
[25:12] In fact, give me your phone,
I'll call him right now.
[25:15] Hey, listen to us, take a seat.
[25:17] How can I calmly take a seat?
[25:20] Come on, look at this innocent face,
[25:22] look at these eyes, so full of greed,
[25:25] I mean desires,
so full of wishes, look.
[25:29] Ayaz? You didn't tell Rania?
[25:32] How many proposals
have I brought for you,
[25:33] how many times have I tried
for your relationship,
[25:35] and you rejected all of them.
If you're still a bachelor then it’s your fault.
[25:38] Rania, he has an inverted brain,
he does not like any proposal.
[25:42] Oh, so is that so?
[25:45] Okay then, we'll find a girl,
[25:47] when we find the perfect girl we'll just inform
him, there is no need to involve him, okay?
[25:51] What happened, what are you saying?
[25:53] Be quiet,
[25:54] family searches for a good proposal,
good boys don't interrupt.
[25:57] Do you understand?
Okay then, we'll look for a girl.
[26:01] Now be happy,
she called you a boy.
[26:04] Hey, why did you come here?
[26:07] Oh, why did I come and
what did you distract me with.
[26:11] Farhad, grandmother is calling you,
we'll decide on your wedding outfit.
[26:15] Grandmother said the outfit should be so good,
nobody could take eyes off it.
[26:19] Mona's engagement and your wedding
with be celebrated on a grand scale, okay?
[26:22] Okay, okay.
Come fast, she's waiting.
[26:25] Did you see?
[26:29] Sister?
[26:30] Sister?
When will I get my dress?
[26:33] Let me look for your bride first.
[26:35] I'm asking for the event.
[26:42] See mother,
I don’t know anything,
[26:44] I want a gold jewelry set.
[26:46] And a very heavy and
amazing wedding dress.
[26:50] Wow.
[26:51] I want people to stare at me
when I walk.
[26:54] And it’ll be your greatness.
[26:57] And if it’s not up to the mark,
[27:00] then my in-laws will get the taunts
that mean you and your family.
[27:03] No, no taunts, I can’t take any insults,
it’ll be really embarrassing.
[27:07] Call Mahir, I’ll give him the money then
you can shop for anything you like.
[27:12] There is nothing greater than a
person’s respect and reputation.
[27:17] Mother, explain this clearly to Mahir,
[27:20] to not be stingy in my matters.
[27:23] I’m going to call him.
[27:25] Grandmother, what is happening?
[27:28] It seems like either you have a well
for money or that alien Khawar has.
[27:32] So much waste of money?
On daughter-in-laws sister?
[27:36] She’s also like our daughter,
[27:38] and daughter’s sister like also
a part of family.
[27:42] Grandmother, let me explain.
[27:43] Rania, see, these are the matters
of wealthy households,
[27:47] let me handle it.
Grandmother,
[27:48] we’ll not get a better chance to prove
[27:53] that our family is richer
then Khawar’s family.
[27:56] Yes.
[27:57] And we’re not misers,
we spend wholeheartedly.
[28:01] Yes, yes.
[28:02] Mother, that’s how you make
an impact on people.
[28:05] When the bride’s sister will be wearing
the most expensive outfit.
[28:09] Else everything is okay.
[28:11] But grandmother, such expense
on just an engagement?
[28:15] Grandmother, if you have taken
the responsibility of Mona’s wedding,
[28:19] then you should not back off.
[28:21] No, no, why would I back off?
[28:25] Yay.
[28:27] That’s like a man.
[28:30] Then listen to me,
[28:32] I’ll come to this event wearing
casual clothes.
[28:36] I’ll see who’s going to throw me
out of the venue,
[28:39] or how will my respect decrease.
[28:41] Grandmother, what is she saying?
Explain it to her.
[28:43] I am already telling you,
do not try to talk to me.
[28:46] What a doom,
[28:48] the tradition that can be carried out by
feeding 2 sweets and enjoying on music,
[28:52] why would you spend
so much money on that?
[28:54] I’ve made my mind,
[28:56] before anything else,
I’ll get this show-off banned.
[28:58] What, what, what?
You’ll get it banned?
[29:01] You? How?
[29:02] Why do I tell you she could put
an evil I on it?
[29:06] Grandmother, I think she has already
planned on the wedding day,
[29:10] she’ll climb the electric pole
and protest.
[29:14] Just keep watching,
[29:15] I’ll hang the people from the pole,
the ones who waste money.
[29:18] Just waiting for my time.
[29:20] Leave her, mother, ask Mahir,
[29:23] when is he going to give me money
so I could go and shop?
[29:25] Why would I give the money?
Father was going to send the money.
[29:27] Grandmother, call father.
[29:29] I’ll call him, but Seema I’m wondering,
where is Mona?
[29:33] I hope it doesn’t happen that the whole venue
is prepared and the bride doesn’t arrive.
[29:37] God, it’ll be so much fun if it happens,
[29:40] your show-off will go down the drain.
[29:42] No, God forbid, no, no.
[29:45] Don’t say this, they’re already going,
[29:47] go shop with them, for my sake.
[29:50] Won’t you make me happy?
Go get a dress or two,
[29:52] and some small jewelry, go,
go, my child.
[29:55] Grandmother.
[29:56] Go, I’m telling you,
go for my sake,
[29:59] go and shop.
[30:06] Now she must be thinking
how many people could get groceries
[30:10] and how many of their needs
met with this money.
[30:12] These poor people always have
eyes on others’ money,
[30:16] now what do we do?
Wear rags?
[30:20] We should give away our clothes,
our money, our everything?
[30:22] Are we a non-profit organization?
[30:24] Yes obviously, you’re such a rich
and wealthy family’s heir,
[30:29] and your husband, a millionaire,
billionaire, or Prince Saleem?
[30:33] How can you understand
poor people’s problems?
[30:36] You only know
how to insult others.
[30:37] Mother, tell him,
[30:40] I’m going to get my bag,
take me to shopping.
[30:42] Yes, yes.
[30:44] Listen, buy her whatever she asks for.
[30:48] And also get some things for Rania.
[30:53] Okay?
[31:02] Where is Rabail? Who you went to bring.
[31:05] She is not coming let’s go.
[31:07] At least tell me where we are going.
[31:09] To the same mall where you buy
a thousand rupee things for five thousand.
[31:20] Hey, stop.
[31:22] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[31:24] You are leaving without me, God I’m dead.
Where did she come from?
[31:28] What happened?
[31:28] It took me two seconds to get changed
and you were leaving without me.
[31:32] You are also coming with us?
[31:33] Of course I am.
First decide who wants to come,
[31:37] I am not going to stop
my car again and again.
[31:38] Just me.
Come on sit.
[31:40] Yes, give me the chance.
[31:43] Let me sit, hey Rania tell me,
how is my makeup?
[31:45] Fabulous.
Shall we leave?
[31:48] Switch on the A/C,
[31:49] I am having a heart attack,
you made your aunt run.
[31:53] Mahir, what route is this?
This a shortcut aunt.
[31:57] I didn’t have much time
to take the long route
[32:00] Look at those people,
[32:02] their bike broke down,
go and help them.
[32:04] They show should fix it
on the side,
[32:08] not in the middle of the road.
[32:12] Hey stop.
[32:14] No, no, no, no.
[32:16] They look like snatchers
hide your things.
[32:18] What are you looking
at hide your phone.
[32:20] They are dacoits.
Give us everything.
[32:23] I swear I have nothing,
all of this is artificial,
[32:26] bought everything on sale
I have nothing.
[32:28] Don’t try to be over smart,
is this your age to joke?
[32:31] Quick, give me everything.
Old lady?
[32:34] He called me an old lady.
[32:35] Stay quiet let me handle this.

[32:41] Roll over the windows.
Take out everything.
[32:45] Don’t you have any shame,
[32:46] you are pointing your gun
at a woman?
[32:48] If you are a real man then come here

[32:50] What real man?
[32:53] What are you going to talk to him,

[32:56] you come here and talk to me.
You keep going there.
[32:59] Take out you thing, fast, give me.
[33:00] Don’t you have any shame pointing

[33:05] then I will tell you what I really am.
Come here.
[33:30] Master, they made me go crazy,
[33:34] I’m dizzy.
[33:36] Is he mad?
To hell with all of you,
[33:37] you made him go crazy.
All of you get out of the car.
[33:42] Getting out.
[33:46] New chaos.
[33:50] Okay, okay, okay.
[33:52] Stand here, stand here.

[33:55] Don’t shoot, we’ll give,
we will give you everything.
[33:58] Give us whatever you have.
[34:01] Brothers, she is crying for so long
[34:06] and you didn’t even ask
that why is she crying?
[34:10] You could’ve asked as a fellow human,
[34:13] all Muslims are brothers and sisters,
did you ask, why is she crying?
[34:18] What do we tell?
[34:20] We have already been robbed
on the last stop,
[34:23] there were two evil, I mean,
[34:25] needy people like you,
took everything from us.
[34:29] They didn’t leave us with anything,
[34:31] we have to travel a very long way
to meet his sick mother
[34:35] and we don’t have money for fuel.
[34:39] Poor people don’t have
such luxurious car.
[34:41] You were also fooled by the car,
this car doesn’t belong to us.
[34:45] Take off your glasses.
[34:46] Look at his face he looks like
Muneeb butt,
[34:49] only from his face
otherwise he is poor,
[34:52] his jacket, shoes, everything is thrifted,
he is a very poor man.
[34:56] Are you mad?
Stop your nonsense.
[34:58] And her? You have already
called her an old lady,
[35:00] she doesn’t even have a phone, no wonder
how she talks to her husband at night.
[35:06] Now look at my health,
compare me to yourself,
[35:09] and tell me who is poor?
[35:11] Sorry sister,
your story made me very sad,
[35:14] here take this 500 rupees for fuel,
[35:19] go, may you have a safe journey.
[35:23] Just 500?
[35:24] That’s all we could rob since morning.
[35:26] Thank you so much brothers,
remember your sister in your prayers,
[35:31] and may God give you success
in your business.
[35:34] Amen.
[35:35] Come on, let’s go before
another one comes.
[35:37] You two listen to me,
[35:39] all this happened
because of my good deeds.
[35:41] Thank God that I was with you.
[35:44] I have memorized their faces,
[35:46] if I ever find them without guns
I will beat them very badly.
[35:50] Bloody blinds,
calling me an old lady.
[36:04] Five Thousand,
[36:06] Oh God,
[36:08] is everything this expensive?
[36:26] Rania, come here
[36:29] Yes.
How is the dress?
[36:30] Very nice, for who?
For you.
[36:33] For me?
Yes.
[36:34] I won’t wear such an expensive dress,
[36:36] I’ve stopped buying expensive things.
[36:39] Where is the tag? It is not that expensive,
it must be around 3000-4000.
[36:42] Here is the tag,
[36:44] it’s of nine thousand.
So buy it.
[36:47] He is being so kind you should take it,
why are you being so stubborn?
[36:51] Kind? No, no,
I am not being kind.
[36:55] She is our guest,
[36:58] if she doesn’t wear anything good,
we will be insulted
[37:01] that’s why I am saying
she should buy it.
[37:05] I am not responsible for your nose
[37:07] Fine,
[37:10] you have already decided that
you want to get grandmother insulted
[37:13] but I am not going to let that happen.
[37:14] I will buy anything of my choice for you.
[37:20] You are very stupid,
[37:22] if he would have offered me, I would have
asked for two instead of one,
[37:25] he has the habit of
only spending on himself.
[37:29] Daughter-in-law of the house.
