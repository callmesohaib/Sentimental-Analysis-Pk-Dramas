[00:19] What's the matter Bebo,
[00:21] smiling like this alone in the kitchen?
[00:24] Everything alright?
[00:27] Nothing, I just remembered a joke.
[00:30] Joke?
[00:32] Tell me, I'll also laugh.
[00:34] No, it wasn't that good,
leave it.
[00:37] I'm just cutting some fruits for father,
[00:40] doctor strictly asked to feed him fruits,
even if he denies it.
[00:44] You're cutting these for grandfather?
[00:47] Bebo,
[00:49] can I go and give them
to grandfather? Please.
[00:51] Why,
[00:52] do you want to add your points?
[00:54] Something like that, please.
[00:59] Okay, take them,
[01:02] and tell him you cut these,
I won't tell anyone.
[01:06] Wow, you are a great woman,
[01:09] I would say we don't have
such a woman nowadays,
[01:11] May God fulfill all your wishes
as well as mine.
[01:16] Thank you.
Hey,
[01:17] tell me what is the wish of your heart?
[01:22] Why are these attempts
of flattery on father?
[01:28] If a boy is looking after
the elders of the house,
[01:31] then what could be the purpose?
[01:36] I get some of it.
[01:39] You're getting it right,
[01:41] it's such a difficult mission,
[01:43] pray to God to make me successful.
[01:46] Okay.
[01:50] He's a nice guy,
[01:53] he'll also look good
with Rania as a pair,
[01:58] but where is Rania?
[02:05] Hello?
[02:06] Yes my child, greetings.
[02:09] How are you, everything alright?
It's good?
[02:12] Did Sweetie create some turmoil
behind my back?
[02:16] Oh, no, no, no, mother,
[02:19] she's managing everything with
so much integrity and skills,
[02:23] you'll be surprised to see this
on your return.
[02:28] Sweetie is managing
the house really well.
[02:31] Okay, I'll believe it if you say so,
[02:35] but it's quite unbelievable.
[02:37] Tell more.
[02:39] If I'm telling you it must be true,
[02:41] okay tell me mother, how is uncle?
[02:44] Look mother, if uncle needs money
for treatment
[02:49] then tell me, I'll bring it myself.
[02:53] Live long, live long.
[02:56] Okay then, greetings.
[03:01] What were you saying?
[03:02] Greetings.
[03:04] Before that,
[03:07] you were talking about
the treatment of some relative,
[03:09] you were offering them my dollars?
[03:13] No, no, there is nothing like that Sweetie.
[03:16] I just said it randomly.
[03:19] How can it be randomly?
It's the same example,
[03:21] you went to spend when you didn't
have a penny in your pocket.
[03:25] If you're having such sympathies
with your relatives
[03:27] then admit him to some charity hospital.
[03:30] Turn down your volume Sweetie.
[03:34] Why would I turn down the volume?
Why would I turn the volume down,
[03:36] did I ask for a debt from someone?
[03:38] Or am I eating by borrowing
from someone?
[03:40] Sister-in-law, sister-in-law,
shout a little low, please.
[03:43] Seema did all the house chores,
[03:45] scolded me,
and now went to sleep peacefully,
[03:47] if she wakes up again
[03:50] she'll start attacking again,
so please, slow.
[03:53] Tell me how to yell slowly?
[03:56] And your Seema,
how did she sleep at this time?
[03:58] Now who'll reheat the food for me?
[04:00] Me, I'm here, your husband,
[04:03] I'll reheat it for you, Sweetie.
[04:05] Oh no sister-in-law, I'm here
I'll reheat the dinner for you, me.
[04:08] Why would you do that?
I'm her husband,
[04:11] I have the responsibility
to look after her
[04:14] and reheat the food,
are you her uncle?
[04:16] Oh, brother what happened,
I'm a brother-in-law,
[04:18] if I reheat food for sister-in-law
it'll be my duty,
[04:20] give me a chance to earn
a good deed.
[04:22] No, no, no, no, I'll reheat the food,
you can leave it.
[04:25] Oh no, brother it’s my duty,
I'll reheat the food.
[04:27] Duty can go to hell,
[04:29] it's my right I am the husband I'll get it.
[04:32] Oh no, brother, it's my duty
I'll reheat the food, end of discussion.
[04:35] It's my right.
[04:37] First it's my duty.
First it’s my right.
[04:38] Oh no.
Right first.
[04:40] Duty is first.
Right.
[04:41] No brother.
Shut up,
[04:43] you make a drama out of everything.
[04:46] I hate arguments, I'll go and
reheat the food myself.
[04:57] Here you go,
let's make it our routine,
[05:01] it'll save us.
[05:03] As you say brother, as you say.
[05:05] Okay go and get the bottle.
[05:08] Oh water bottle, of cold water,
I'm thirsty that's why I'm asking.
[05:20] What are you doing here?
[05:23] What am I doing,
[05:24] I am getting bored, what else?
[05:26] I came all the way for
an inconsiderate girl to her village,
[05:31] and her welcome?
[05:33] Oh wow, what do I tell.
[05:35] I didn't ask you to come,
[05:40] but still you drove me here
because of my problem,
[05:45] thank you for that.
[05:47] I'll try to return that favour
some time in my life.
[05:52] Return the favor later madam,
[05:56] I'm visiting your village
for the first time,
[05:58] show me around.
[06:03] There is nothing according
to your luxury here.
[06:06] Neither me nor my village.
[06:09] What are you talking about Rania?
[06:11] You're a daughter of such
a rich millionaire father.
[06:14] I'm not anyone's daughter,
[06:16] I'm only my grandfather's granddaughter.
[06:21] Only your grandfather's granddaughter?
[06:26] Then prove it.
[06:31] There is no need for proof in love,
[06:36] grandfather knows
I love him the most.
[06:41] And you don’t need to get worried
about my concern,
[06:45] I'll talk to grandfather by myself,
[06:47] he'll understand me.
[06:50] I know this.
[07:17] Rania, tea.
[07:20] Thank you,
[07:21] put it here I'm busy right now.
[07:22] Have it, it'll get cold.
[07:25] And why are you packing your bag?
[07:30] I'm going back.
[07:32] You're going back and
you didn't tell me?
[07:36] Why would I tell you?
[07:37] Because I am also getting bored here,
[07:39] I'll do this, I'll go to grandmother
[07:42] and tell her clearly
[07:44] that if you want to stay here you can,
[07:47] but I'm going.
[07:49] If you want to go then go gladly,
[07:50] but I'll never go back with you
no matter what.
[07:53] Wow,
[07:55] you can come with me
but can't go back?
[07:58] Why?
[08:00] Then, grandfather's condition made me
worried that's why I had to come.
[08:04] Now that he's better,
[08:06] and happy with his son,
I'm going.
[08:09] Rania since when did you
start talking like this?
[08:12] You used to settle other's matters,
[08:14] what happened now,
can't settle your own matter?
[08:18] Because I don't want to
settle this matter.
[08:20] Did you hear that?
[08:23] You're a strange girl,
[08:26] it's very difficult to understand you.
[08:29] So who asked you to do
a research on me?
[08:32] Rania,
[08:35] you don't care about
anyone's feelings at all?
[08:38] You do?
[08:40] Then go and tell them to consider you
as their daughter from now.
[08:44] Ask forgiveness from God,
[08:47] who's talking about those feelings,
[08:49] I was talking about my feelings.
[08:53] Your?
[08:55] Feelings?
[08:59] You're one of those
who only live for themselves.
[09:04] Your ego gets hurt on every small thing,
[09:07] and only take a stand
for their own rights,
[09:10] whatever they do it's for them,
their benefit.
[09:15] I don't want to waste my time
on a person like you,
[09:20] do you understand?
[09:23] Rania.
[09:28] You really think that about me?
[09:31] Yes, that's what I think about you
and it won't change.
[09:51] You've lost the bet Mahir,
[09:54] go and celebrate your loss
with your friends
[09:58] because Rania Ahmed didn't fall for you.
[10:19] My child, I don't want to force you
[10:26] but my health is declining
[10:29] and I get worried for you.
[10:33] I don't have the strength or time,
[10:47] I'm a man of limited time now,
[10:52] a collapsing wall,
[10:56] and at this moment if I have something
to worry about, it's you.
[11:02] I always want you to live
under a cool shed.
[11:11] Grandfather,
[11:14] I don't want to live under a shed,
[11:19] I want to be the tree
[11:27] that provides shelter to others.
[11:32] The confidence and teaching made me able
to fight back in any kind of situation.
[11:50] You shouldn't worry about me.
[11:53] So you won't forgive him?
[11:58] Whenever I try to move towards him,
[12:05] my feet sink to the ground,
[12:10] my heart gets failed with complaints,
[12:16] he didn't do right by us.
[12:22] I want to forgive him
[12:26] but I am not able to.
[12:31] Mother's sad eyes,
[12:37] your never-ending hard work,
[12:43] my orphan childhood,
[12:49] how many things do I forget?
[12:52] No my child,
[12:56] I don't want to force you,
[13:00] do you understand?
[13:03] Zaman did us wrong,
[13:08] but when your heart longs for love
[13:14] and love wins over resentment
[13:24] then forgive him.
[13:32] Are you mad at me?
[13:34] No my child,
[13:38] you're my life,
[13:42] how can anyone be mad at you?
[14:05] Hey sister.
[14:08] Tell me fast what news did you bring?
[14:10] Wait a minute.
[14:12] What you asked me to do,
[14:15] I did it honestly. I swear on you.
[14:18] I met big lawyers, just for you.
[14:21] That's alright but tell me
did they give some hope?
[14:26] Yes but there is a problem,
[14:28] everyone repeated the same thing,
[14:30] all of them are saying that if you try
to have this legal battle you will lose.
[14:37] I mean you'll be disgraced,
[14:40] and you won't be able to prove
that this house, this car,
[14:44] this chair, this couch is made
with your dollars.
[14:47] What? My foot.
[14:49] Dollars are very powerful,
haven't you heard?
[14:52] Might is right.
[14:55] And I have the power of dollars.
[14:57] Sister, you could have told me earlier,
you casually waste in my time.
[15:02] What do you mean?
[15:04] I gave you Dollars to do this job.
[15:08] Madam Sweetie,
[15:10] I meant to say that
[15:12] the time I wasted in running
after the lawyers
[15:16] I wouldn't have done that.
[15:18] We could've come up with some cunning
and clever plan on our own.
[15:26] You're right,
[15:30] I'll also make such a plan,
everyone will be surprised,
[15:36] and then all of this will be in my hands.
[15:43] Aunt you could've stayed a little more,
[15:45] we were all enjoying
your company here.
[15:47] My child, Dabeer and
Sweetie are there alone,
[15:51] I don't know what turmoil
she could've created there.
[15:54] Live long, live long Zaman,
take care and do visit in Lahore.
[16:03] Aunt.
[16:05] Yes my child, you too,
[16:07] you both really took care of me,
[16:10] looked after me and Rania so much.
[16:34] I've tried a lot,
[16:38] but my mind cannot accept
reviving a dead relationship.
[17:18] Take care of yourself.
[18:32] Why did you stop the car?
[18:34] Grandmother,
I'm in love with this place,
[18:37] look at it,
[18:39] such beautiful views and fresh air.
[18:44] I feel like staying here, let me get out.
[18:51] Come Rania, let's walk.
[18:55] No, I don't feel like.
[18:59] What's the matter, you seem upset,
[19:02] what happened?
[19:04] Nobody forced you for anything
[19:07] whatever you decided,
you did it on your own.
[19:12] Then why are you sad?
Why are you worried,
[19:15] go look at how beautiful the place is,
[19:18] such fresh air.
Go, go, have a look.
[19:23] Look, I want my old Rania back,
[19:25] the one who always smiled
and laughed,
[19:28] listen you've always been
my brave girl, right?
[19:31] Then throw away all these worries
outside and go enjoy, go.
[19:38] Then you should also come.
[19:39] How can I go? You both should go.
[19:44] Come.
Go, go.
[19:48] Carefully.
[19:52] Grandmother we'll be back after a walk.
Go, go.
[20:01] What is this?
[20:03] This, this is wheat.
[20:05] Okay,
[20:08] and that, there is a swing,
can we go there?
[20:12] Why?
[20:13] You haven't seen a swing before?
[20:15] Also, grandmother is alone,
so leave it.
[20:19] Grandmother.
Yes.
[20:21] Rania is saying you're alone
in the car,
[20:23] that's why she isn't going far.
[20:25] Oh, who'd take away this old lady?
[20:29] You both can go enjoy,
[20:33] and Rania, show this kid around, go.
[20:39] Come on kid,
let me show you around,
[20:41] and if you do anything mischievous
nobody would be worse than me,
[20:44] and anyway this is my area nobody
would come to save you.
[21:00] Who even wants to be saved.
[21:02] What did you say?
[21:03] Nothing, now you look like my Rania.
[21:11] Come.
[21:22] Hello Rania.
[21:24] Hey, what's up?
[21:27] Wow, you're speaking a lot of English,
[21:31] talk to them in their local language
so they could understand.
[21:35] What do you think, they don't get it?
[21:39] These are very hardworking
and intelligent girls,
[21:41] no matter what language you speak,
they'll understand.
[21:49] What happened Rania?
[21:53] Why do you get sad so often?
You’re serious again.
[21:58] Look,
[22:00] what you’re feeling, I know,
[22:04] I can understand.
[22:06] Frustration, anger,
[22:08] but things will get better with time,
[22:11] give it some time.
[22:13] Do one thing,
[22:15] share your feelings with me,
[22:18] I’ll listen to everything like
a good friend,
[22:23] but please don’t get sad like this.
[22:25] You came into this world
to solve other’s problems.
[22:31] Really?
[22:33] And my problems?
Who’d solve them?
[22:39] You, yourself.
[22:41] Who could be smarter than you.
[22:44] You’re buttering?
[22:45] Oh no, I’m telling the truth.
[22:48] You’re being wise today,
[22:53] where did the sun rise from?
[22:56] From Khushalpur.
[22:58] Rania time is the best teacher
of person’s life,
[23:04] it teaches us everything.
[23:07] You can look at me,
[23:09] till yesterday I was a rich and
wealthy person on my own
[23:12] and used to think the power of money
is greater than everything.
[23:16] And today? I’m empty-handed,
[23:19] I have nothing,
[23:20] but I have a vision,
[23:22] now I’ll get everything in life.
[23:25] I’ll get a lot of success and
earn a lot of money,
[23:28] but on my own.
[23:32] And you,
[23:34] you never respected money,
[23:36] never gave any importance
and now look
[23:38] today you’re a daughter of
such a rich man.
[23:42] I’m so happy for you.
[23:44] I don’t have any interest in my father
or his wealth.
[23:49] Yes but he’s your father,
you accept it or not,
[23:52] but it’s true,
[23:54] that you can’t deny.
[23:58] Can we go now?
[23:59] Grandmother is alone in the car.
So soon?
[24:02] It’s been too long.
[24:04] I didn’t even remember the route,
[24:06] we should roam around, sit for a while.
There is a shortcut, I’ll tell you, come on.
[24:10] Okay.
[24:25] Thank God you’re back,
I missed you so much.
[24:29] You came back at the right time,
[24:31] if you were a few days late
[24:33] you would have lost the authority
to this house.
[24:36] This house didn’t feel like home,
it felt like a prison
[24:39] as if we’re the prisoners sentenced
without a crime.
[24:47] Nobody is born who could
take over my place.
[24:53] How did she become a jailer,
[24:55] I was absent for a few days and
she believed herself to be an owner.
[25:01] I’ll let her know,
[25:03] my name is Azra Jahan
[25:05] and I’m not even afraid
of someone’s father.
[25:08] Yes, here we go,
[25:11] grandmother got her full rage
and now we’ll have a chaos.
[25:17] Call everyone.
[25:18] Come on everyone,
you got an invitation.
[25:23] Greetings, greetings, greetings.
[25:26] I’ve missed you guys a lot.
We also missed you.
[25:29] Next time I visit my village,
you both should come,
[25:31] I’ll also take you for a ride on my pickoo.
[25:33] Really? I didn’t get that offer?
[25:35] I offer according to people’s faces.
[25:37] Mother,
[25:39] mother, welcome home.
[25:42] Welcome home, welcome home.
[25:44] Oh my child, my Hammad.
[25:47] Mother we missed you a lot, what do I tell.
[25:49] Really?
[25:50] Ask Rabail, ask children.
This house became a hell.
[25:56] Oh I can smell my mother.
[25:59] Oh my mother is back, this house
seemed silent without you.
[26:07] Oh mother, you’re back I’m so happy,
I missed you so much.
[26:12] Mahir, my son, the house was
deserted without him,
[26:17] I missed him so much.
[26:19] Why?
What why?
[26:21] You’re Dabeer’s son
so you’d be my son as well.
[26:23] Husband, wife and a child,
family complete.
[26:28] Hey, you’ve gotten so weak,
[26:30] you didn’t get proper food there?
[26:32] You must be getting lentils or vegetable,
[26:35] they’re poor relatives.
[26:39] Yes you’re right,
[26:41] they didn’t have food like our house,
[26:44] they had healthy diet there,
chicken from their own farms daily,
[26:49] cattle from their farm, wow.
[26:51] If start getting the same food at our house
[26:54] then in a few days your dollars would….end.
[27:01] Very funny,
[27:03] your sense of humor is really good Mahir,
[27:06] such people are really
appreciated in America.
[27:10] Seema go and serve the food,
[27:12] mother and my son must be tired,
[27:15] if you would’ve told me earlier I could’ve
prepared something nice for you.
[27:18] You’d prepare food?
[27:20] Then who else prepares the food?
[27:22] Go set the table.
[27:25] Excuse me.
[27:28] Rania, you should also go and
help Seema in the kitchen.
[27:32] Yes.
Wait Rania,
[27:34] you’re tired,
[27:35] you travelled so much, you’d look good
working in the kitchen?
[27:39] Go take rest.
[27:42] Yes Rania, you should rest,
[27:44] I’ll help, come on Shehenshah.
[27:47] Come, come fast.
[27:51] Tell me more darling Mahir,
how was the travel,
[27:53] did the car run smoothly?
Did my baby get tired?
[27:57] Dabeer, why is she acting
like this with Mahir?
[28:00] Mother, leave her on her own,
[28:03] you should sit comfortably I’ll give you
a foot massage you must be tired.
[28:08] Mother, I can also give you
a foot massage.
[28:11] Really? Then get on it, let’s see.
[28:14] Oh God, come on.
[28:24] Listen to me,
[28:25] you eat equal to a whole crew
[28:28] and you have no strength
in your hands.
[28:30] Massage properly,
[28:34] more, more strength,
[28:37] yes.
[28:40] Seema, Rabail, serve the dinner fast,
[28:43] the gases are going to mother’s brain
because of empty stomach. Hurry.
[28:47] I won’t have dinner for a while,
for an hour, you massage my feet.
[28:53] Yes properly.
[28:58] Wow, your village is so beautiful Rania.
[29:02] The people are also very beautiful.
[29:06] Yes but not more than you.
[29:08] What?
[29:10] No, no, nothing, look at this picture,
[29:12] this is from Rania’s house.
[29:14] She has such cute parrots and pigeons.
[29:16] Aww, they’re so cute,
[29:18] Rania if you didn’t take me next time,
I won’t talk to you.
[29:21] Done, you should come with me
the next time.
[29:22] Sure?
Me too?
[29:25] No, not you.
[29:28] Next time, not you,
I will take you both along with me.
[29:33] Aren’t you getting too informal?
[29:35] Then let him be,
[29:37] my brother Mahir doesn’t get
informal with anyone anyway,
[29:39] what’s wrong if he’s getting
informal with you?
[29:42] There are more pictures, see.
[29:45] Oh wow, whose house is this?
[29:48] This, remember I told you about my friend.
[29:50] Don’t sit here, and go away from here.
[29:54] What happened Rabail,
[29:55] why are you talking
to Shehenshah like this?
[29:58] You don’t know, I’ve been noticing him
for a few days,
[30:01] he’s always after aunt Sweetie,
[30:04] I think he tells our stories to her.
[30:08] Shehenshah.
[30:23] What is this?
[30:24] Sister, you gave a space in your house
to an orphan like me,
[30:28] you think of me as a part of a family
instead of a servant,
[30:31] made me sit with you
on the dining table.
[30:33] How could you even think
this Shehenshah would deceive you?
[30:37] Sister always remember,
[30:39] I’m a pathan,
once I’m loyal to someone
[30:43] I can give my life
but won’t do treachery.
[30:47] I agree I have a big appetite
but I only eat halal,
[30:50] I won’t even consider haram stuff like this.
[30:54] I was with her only for the purpose
of finding out
[30:56] what she’s planning next and
saving you from the upcoming danger.
[31:04] Shehenshah.
Shehenshah.
[31:09] You’re like a brother.
[31:11] Well from all these things,
[31:13] it seems like the part about
your appetite came from the heart.
[31:16] Shehenshah, I’m sorry,
please forgive.
[31:22] Forgiven.
[31:24] Take a seat Shehenshah.
[31:25] Shehenshah, what’s aunt Sweetie
planning next?
[31:30] Sweetie was telling,
she changed her strategy,
[31:33] that if she couldn’t get her way easily
then she’ll twist her plans.
[31:39] What are you talking about,
tell us clearly what’s the plan?
[31:42] Brother Mahir,
you’re in a great danger,
[31:45] she’ll trap you by pretending to love you
to get everything from you,
[31:49] and you’ll be stuck there,
you won’t be able to do anything.
[31:52] She laid out this trap already,
[31:54] Tell us what she is planning next?
[31:57] Sister I don’t know all the details
[31:59] but I know one thing,
[32:01] no matter if she loves or she hates,
[32:03] it will be a loss to brother Mahir.
[32:09] Brother Mahir, you’re very unsafe,
[32:14] she taught this English to me.
[32:21] Brother, what are you thinking now?
[32:24] We don’t know anything Rabail,
[32:27] what’s going to happen next.
[32:29] But I can’t live in a place that has
so many conspiracies going on,
[32:35] I have to leave this house.
[32:40] Thank you so much Shehenshah.
[32:53] It’s enough now, I’ve decided,
[32:55] that today I’ll leave her house.
[32:59] But Mahir a person like you,
[33:01] who has always seen a prosperous life,
spent a good like,
[33:05] how can you leave all this
and live alone?
[33:08] I don’t know,
[33:10] but I can’t tolerate all this,
[33:13] I’ve never spent my life like this,
[33:15] so much of tantrums so many taunts,
[33:18] and earlier she used to taunt and
how suddenly a change of behavior.
[33:23] I’m understanding everything,
why is there a change,
[33:27] and father had told me earlier
[33:29] that all the dollars he sent
belonged to aunt Sweetie,
[33:33] I swear to God I wouldn’t have
asked even once.
[33:36] And now the family property and
the money they sent is all mixed,
[33:40] we never kept a tally of it.
[33:44] Okay don’t worry,
[33:45] if you don’t want to stay here,
my house is available to you,
[33:49] we’ll live in the same house,
we’ll share a room, what else?
[33:51] I never would’ve thought,
[33:53] I’d have such situations,
[33:56] I did understand
[33:58] that she was playing a game,
[34:02] she wanted to manipulate me into
signing the property documents.
[34:09] Brother Mahir,
just stay on your word,
[34:11] don’t get deceived,
[34:13] she shouldn’t get this property
[34:15] because this is also your family inheritance
[34:18] which would be a lot more than
the dollars they sent.
[34:21] That’s true,
[34:23] only God knows what will happen next.
[34:30] Share your feelings with me,
[34:33] I’ll listen to everything like a good friend,
[34:37] but please don’t get sad like this.
[34:40] You came into this world
to solve others’ problems.
[34:59] Where are you lost?
[35:09] You’re thinking about your father, right?
[35:12] Why are you hurting yourself,
why don’t you forgive him?
[35:16] Do you even know what he did,
[35:20] how can someone do this
to their child?
[35:23] I can’t forgive him.
[35:26] Rania these relationships are
really precious
[35:29] don’t look away from them,
[35:32] look at me,
[35:33] I don’t have a mother or father,
[35:36] ask me the importance of
these relationships.
[35:40] But I had,
[35:42] but he left me,
[35:46] and now that I’ve learned
to live without him
[35:51] then why would I accept him?
[35:53] Rania, it’s a really big decision,
[35:55] give yourself some time, try to understand
then make a decision
[35:59] and then some decisions are made
by time for us.
[36:03] Grandmother was telling
he lives in the same city.
[36:05] Yes, he lives with Dr. Wasiq,
[36:09] I’ve met him often,
[36:11] I didn’t know
[36:13] the person I was meeting because of
my dead father is actually my dead father.
[36:20] The one who rejected me
in my childhood.
[36:24] Does that mean Dr. Wasiq
is your brother?
[36:27] But he seems older than you.
[36:31] Okay, so that means uncle
had already married earlier.
[36:35] Oh no, he’s not my brother,
[36:38] he’s a son of some friend of father’s,
[36:41] but lives with my father.
[36:46] Well,
[36:48] don’t worry,
[36:50] you’ll see God will solve
all your problems soon.
[36:54] Ameen,
[36:56] you’re really nice.
[36:58] Thank you.
[37:01] Listen, Mahir hasn’t returned
since the morning?
[37:04] Yes it’s been a while,
[37:06] he went in the morning
now it’s evening,
[37:08] he should’ve been back,
I don’t know where he is.
[37:10] Then call him and find out,
it’s not right to disappear like this.
[37:14] You’re right, I’ll call.
Yes.
[37:16] Let me ask where is he?
[37:27] Mahir hasn’t returned,
[37:29] we should be the ones worried about
it because we are his family, not you.
[37:33] But sadly, you aren’t,
so let me worry.
[37:37] Listen to me girl,
[37:39] you’re here only for a while
[37:41] don’t think of yourself
as a part of this family,
[37:44] do your work and get on your way back,
do you understand?
[37:46] Rest depends on me
and my son.
[37:49] Your son?
[37:52] Rabail are you seeing this change?
[37:55] Aunt, this changed
the behavior of yours,
[37:59] isn’t being digested by any of us,
[38:02] it seems like there is a bell
of danger ringing.
[38:06] I think the biggest reason why everyone
at the home stays upset with me, is you.
[38:12] You manipulated everyone
to be against me.
[38:16] They say the truth,
[38:17] we should stay away
from the poor relatives.
[38:20] Jealous people.
[38:22] No matter how much you try,
but in this house,
[38:27] I won’t leave you,
[38:29] I’ll always be on your head
if you’re here.
[38:33] Rania.
You’ll see.
[38:34] Rania what happened, put it down,
come here, come.
[38:37] Come Rania, what are you doing,
you’ve gone crazy.
