[01:46] I don't know what is happening to me,
[01:48] I keep thinking about this girl 24/7.
[01:52] I have to admit
[01:54] I have some distinguished
feelings for her.
[01:59] When she is in front of me
I don't like anything else.
[02:03] If she is out of my sight
there is nothing I want to see.
[02:14] I didn't want this,
what is happening to me?
[02:18] Although she does not even
fall to my standards, yet,
[02:21] yet I don't know why.
[02:26] Well she's really egoistic,
she won't ever agree.
[02:30] But me,
[02:32] I've made up my mind,
[02:34] you'll be the one to approach me.
[02:37] You'll have to give up,
[02:40] that's how our love story
will move forward.
[03:17] Uncle,
[03:22] uncle.
[03:25] Uncle, wake up, open your eyes.
[03:27] How are you?
[03:30] Fine,
[03:32] don't need to worry.
[03:35] If you're not getting better
by this doctor
[03:37] then we should change the doctor.
[03:39] No there is nothing like that,
[03:43] I just have a fever,
it'll go away in a while.
[03:48] Okay then I should call Rania here,
at least you'll be comforted.
[03:53] No don't call Rania,
[03:55] she will be worried for no reason.
[03:58] Also, they're having a good time
at sister's house,
[04:02] let her participate in it as well.
[04:06] I'm just tired,
I got tired.
[04:09] It happens when one gets tired,
[04:12] we get a fever.
[04:14] It'll be fine, nothing happened.
[04:18] Okay, then I'll get lunch for you.
[04:22] No.
[04:23] I'm not going to listen to you.
[04:25] I'm going to get you a meal
and you have to eat it.
[04:28] I'm going to get it.
[04:48] Mr. Dabeer you've disappeared
from here
[04:51] like the horns from
the donkey's head.
[04:55] The one I held captive for 20 years,
ran away.
[05:02] Well,
[05:03] I won't sit back,
[05:06] Mr. Dabeer Ahmed Chaudhary,
I'll chase you till your grave.
[05:10] Oh God,
[05:14] seems like I'm getting really
sentimental thinking about all this.
[05:18] No, no, no, no.
[05:21] I won't chase anyone till grave
not Dabeer's nor mine.
[06:22] What am I even thinking,
[06:25] I'm crazy.
[07:08] If he has pride in himself,
[07:14] he isn't wrong for it.
[07:24] Sister-in-law,
what's happening to father?
[07:28] He was well, why does he get
so sick so often now?
[07:33] Father had a lot of hopes
for this proposal,
[07:36] the one you rejected.
[07:38] To be honest he is tired
now my responsibility,
[07:41] concern for you,
care about Rania.
[07:45] He is all alone,
how long will he manage?
[07:48] I think his strength is giving up.
[07:52] Why are you scaring me?
[07:59] I am not scaring you,
I am explaining to you.
[08:03] Uncle is really worried about
your marriage, get married.
[08:07] To be honest, your fate scared me.
[08:11] Your deserted life became
a fear for me.
[08:14] I don't want some cruel and
cold-hearted man to be a part of my life.
[08:19] And also I heard,
[08:22] a sister or a daughter has to bear
the consequences of a man's actions.
[08:27] No Bebo,
[08:32] uncle's nobility and piousness will
always protect you and Rania.
[08:39] Don't let your heart be the victim
of these suspicions.
[08:44] Move forward with your life,
[08:46] get settled,
[08:49] do you understand?
[08:58] Oh, okay, this is the list for
Mona's engagement, okay, okay.
[09:02] Yes, prepared it for you.
[09:04] Rent for the venue,
meal for 500 people.
[09:08] Fireworks, flower garlands,
watches as gifts, groom's gift.
[09:13] 400 kgs of sweets.
Groom's outfit, bridal dress,
[09:15] bridal jewelry, giveaways for family.
10 drummers, rings for the bride and groom.
[09:19] Sound system, money for gifts.
[09:21] Oh God.
[09:22] And oh, there is more, it isn't ending.
[09:24] Dabeer, keep reading.
Sweets.
[09:27] Flower petals, garlands,
drummers.
[09:29] Decorators, chairs, children's clothes,
snacks, ice cream, money for charity.
[09:32] Horse ride and what is this?
A monkey's play for the guests?
[09:37] Oh fear the God, mother.
[09:38] All of this won't be possible.
[09:41] You're absolutely right uncle,
I agree with you.
[09:45] How can't this be possible?
[09:47] Did you forget what family
do you belong to?
[09:50] What parent's and
ancestor's offspring you are?
[09:54] Your grandfather had elephants
hanging from the door.
[10:00] Elephants hanging?
[10:02] Yes.
[10:03] What a sight it must be,
elephants taking a swing.
[10:09] Well the rope that was used must've been
imported from some genie's kingdom, right?
[10:14] Rania, the amount of meals
they are preparing,
[10:18] I think they've actually
invited genies and ghosts.
[10:21] The girl who's getting married,
[10:25] is my daughter-in-law
Seema's younger sister,
[10:29] she's her biological sister, right?
[10:31] And the Rafique Ahmed,
[10:34] where she's getting married,
there are rivers of cash flowing there.
[10:38] And that son of his, that.
That cricket sized.
[10:41] Yes, yes, cricket-sized son.
[10:45] He, since this proposal was finalized,
[10:49] has been too arrogant.
[10:51] I didn't like this relationship at all.
[10:53] But Seema was impressed
by the money.
[10:56] And that's how we got
all the responsibilities.
[10:59] Thank God, that our Rabail is saved.
[11:02] And that Mona, she's a wonder,
[11:05] she'll recite an enchantment,
[11:07] and that Khawar will turn into
her own flying monkey.
[11:09] My child, leave the cricket and
flying monkey, talk about me.
[11:15] Mother, look at this, I'm begging you
to please have mercy on me.
[11:21] Forgive me for God's sake,
I can't make all of this happen.
[11:25] If my Mahir had enough money,
[11:28] my heart wouldn't be broken today.
[11:30] On my one call,
[11:32] he would give all his treasures,
and he'd spend money like this, like this.
[11:37] Stop it mother, "spend like this".
[11:40] I've asked this pale monkey
so many times, mother.
[11:44] I've been sending him dollars all my life,
[11:48] and I advised him,
to not spend it all, save them.
[11:54] But him, you know
what this idiot did?
[11:56] Bought some houses here,
rented them
[12:00] and now he's living off of the rent.
[12:02] If this idiot were smart,
[12:05] we'd have 4-7 plazas in this city.
[12:09] You're absolutely right uncle.
[12:11] Now that you are back look at
the shopping of this strange prince,
[12:15] he'd decorate his jacket with the moon
and the stars if he could.
[12:19] What are you staring at?
[12:21] I will tell the reality to my uncle.
[12:23] Uncle, focus on his brought up,
[12:26] doesn't perceive poor people
as human.
[12:29] The poor have no respect or status
and front of him.
[12:31] I don't know what he thinks of himself.
[12:34] And, and, the idea of showing off
at the wedding it was also his,
[12:37] innocent grandmother just
agrees with him.
[12:40] Hey, what am I hearing?
[12:42] Father, father, I don't know
what is she saying,
[12:45] I am also hearing this
for the first time.
[12:47] I am more surprised than you are,
don't you have manners?
[12:50] Stop your nonsense,
[12:51] you keep saying whatever comes
to your mind.
[12:53] "I'm more surprised than you"
you don't have any wisdom, you donkey.
[13:00] Hello? Yes, wife? How are you?
[13:05] Dabeer, why don't you
answer my calls?
[13:08] Return first,
[13:09] then I'll let you know in a way
you won't forget.
[13:13] Yes, yes, yes,
okay, okay.
[13:17] Absolutely already, okay.
[13:18] Is he talking to his wife or his boss?
[13:24] So when is my crown returning?
[13:26] Husband's audacity, I'll return
whenever you order me to.
[13:31] Well sweetie,
[13:33] I gave you a leave application
for 1 month.
[13:37] I tore off that application right there.
[13:40] And tell me honestly, how many dollars
did you take from here?
[13:44] Money? No, no, no,
I didn't bring any money. Sweetie.
[13:48] What is that witch saying?
Let me talk to her,
[13:53] I will make her right, give it to me.
[13:56] She isn't saying anything mother,
she is sending you greetings.
[14:00] Yes, I told the mother that
you are sending your regards.
[14:05] Sweetie, I fell off the stairs
while talking to you.
[14:12] Hello? Hello?
[14:14] I'll talk to you later.
Hello?
[14:24] Oh, thank God.
[14:27] Damn you.
[14:29] What did I do?
[14:31] Disgraced our whole family.
[14:34] You are my son and
yet that coward?
[14:37] Get lost, I'm so angry,
I'm going.
[14:41] Mother, don't be so angry,
your blood pressure will go up.
[14:46] Listen, listen to me calmly,
[14:48] some situations demand
a certain thing.
[14:51] Rania, Rania my child,
explain this to mother.
[14:54] Yes, grandmother look.
Why would she explain,
[14:58] she is the only smart person
in the house?
[15:00] There are a lot of people in this house
who're smarter than her.
[15:03] You are not one of them,
sit quietly,
[15:06] you wooden monkey,
you keep speaking anything.
[15:10] Look, mother, I am still telling you,
[15:13] send the message to the groom's family
that we will have a simple engagement.
[15:17] I am not going to waste my
hard-earned money by myself.
[15:22] Whatever she does with you,
she is right.
[15:26] Listen to me very clearly,
[15:28] I will sell a house but
won't cut the expenses.
[15:33] Oh mother listen to me.
What does that mean?
[15:35] Mother stop.
[15:36] Don't do this stupidity, don't sell the house,
I only have one property in my name.
[15:45] Well, tell me honestly,
why did you call me here,
[15:48] do you know how difficult
it was for me to get here?
[15:51] Well actually,
[15:53] I was thinking to meet you before
the engagement, I do have the right.
[15:58] And I swear I fell and love with
you the first time I saw you.
[16:05] Oh God, swear?
[16:07] I swear on you.
[16:11] Then why didn't you tell me?
[16:13] You didn't have the guts to do that.
[16:16] Don't talk about guts the world uses
the examples of my bravery.
[16:24] Listen, come out,
it was just a tire burst.
[16:30] So what were you saying?
[16:32] My bravery.
[16:34] Yes I witnessed.
[16:37] You must've seen that day,
[16:40] on the engagement I said no
at the last moment.
[16:44] Because I was falling for you.
[16:49] Well tell me honestly,
what do you think of me?
[16:52] See, I can't speak the truth,
[16:56] but yes
[16:58] I'm not the one to live
in the Dreamland.
[17:03] I never imagined my future husband
to be like a movie star,
[17:12] I mean he should be,
but a blonde monkey.
[17:15] But yes he should have a big house,
[17:18] a shiny new car,
[17:20] and nothing else in his wallet
except my picture and money.
[17:25] Look, I'm blonde but not a monkey,
[17:28] you'll see on the engagement day,
[17:30] I'll get ready at the salon,
[17:32] and I'll look so good your friends
will want to keep looking at me.
[17:35] And that damned Rabail will regret.
[17:37] What, what did you just say?
[17:39] Look, listen to me.
[17:41] If you have anything in your heart,
tell me already.
[17:44] No, I only have you
in my lungs or hearts.
[17:48] I could swear if you want.
[17:51] No there is no need for that,
but can you do one thing for me?
[17:58] I'll do two things.
[18:01] I always wanted to receive a car
as a wedding gift from you.
[18:06] Two, I'll gift you two cars.
[18:08] The one I'll drive on my own.
[18:11] I'll get scolded at home,
nothing else.
[18:13] Listen? What do you keep mumbling?
[18:16] Nothing, don't worry my darling.
[18:21] Can I call you darling?
[18:26] Yes, yes, why not darling?
[18:32] Listen, that's enough talking,
now order something to eat.
[18:36] Yes, yes, waiter.
[18:39] Two of whatever you have cooked.
[18:41] We'll have one here then one later.
[18:43] Yes, have this in the car.
[18:51] Brother you have given me a lot of hope
[18:55] see we are an average household,
[18:57] my son just started his job.
[18:59] We can't be doing all these
excessive expenses.
[19:01] Sister, what are you saying?
[19:03] Have you looked at me? Do I look like
a nawab's son?
[19:08] I am a really hard-working person,
I work really hard in America.
[19:12] I have spent a very sad life there, mint.
[19:17] Well, leave it, let it go.
[19:21] So we've decided that we won't arrange
Rabail and Farhad's wedding
[19:26] along with Mona and
Khawar's wedding.
[19:29] We'll do it separately, according
to our budget, okay sister?
[19:34] Thank you.
[19:35] What pious thinking you have,
what great mindset you've got.
[19:38] I don't know why I feel like forming
a relationship with your family.
[19:42] I mean.
Ayaz.
[19:44] No, no, uncle the matter is,
[19:48] we're only two brothers,
a sister had died.
[19:51] If I had a younger sister
I would have thought about you.
[19:55] I am already impressed
with your family.
[20:00] Uncle what do you do in America?
[20:02] Yes uncle, what else,
I just do labor work for my children.
[20:06] Brother, you're here alone,
you could've brought your wife along.
[20:12] Yes, that, well sister,
it's better not to mention her.
[20:17] She appears if you think about her.
[20:22] You didn't understand?
[20:25] It’s okay, let it be,
let's have the tea.
[20:29] So we're done with the decision.
[20:42] Sister-in-law.
Yes.
[20:45] Look how beautiful Rani looks.
[20:47] Really, with the grace of God.
[20:51] It looks like she grew up in Lahore.
[20:55] How easily she adjusted
to that environment.
[20:59] You know Bebo, that's
the traits of brave girls,
[21:03] they either adjust with the situation
or adjust the situation.
[21:07] Father taught both of these to her.
[21:14] That's true, our Rani is very smart
and brave.
[21:19] Not like either of us.
[21:21] Hey, what are you saying?
[21:23] Rani has so many traits from you,
[21:25] it seems like she is more like you
and her grandfather than me.
[21:30] Exactly like her aunt and grandfather.
[21:33] Thank God she is not like her father.
[21:48] Sorry, sister-in-law.
[21:52] I don't know how it slipped
through my tongue.
[21:56] Sometimes the bitterness of the heart gets
to the tongue even if we stop it a thousand times.
[22:05] It’s okay, bebo.
[22:09] Forget what happened.
[22:12] That time is long gone.
[22:15] I was saying,
[22:17] uncle's condition is a lot better now,
[22:20] you can visit Lahore,
[22:22] they're preparing for the wedding
so you can attend that as well.
[22:26] You should come along, it will be
more fun if we're both together.
[22:30] How can I go,
[22:31] there are so many things to do here
who is going to do that?
[22:34] Also my students will have exams soon,
they'll be in a loss.
[22:38] And greater than anything,
[22:41] uncle needs someone,
[22:43] how can I leave him alone?
[22:45] I can't go leaving him alone,
you should go
[22:48] Rani will be happy to see you.
[22:52] You have also done the preparations.
[23:12] Where did the TV remote go?
[23:17] Pass me the remote.
[23:28] Why do you make such a beautiful face
when you look at me?
[23:31] Hello?
[23:33] Don't try to befriend me
for no reason.
[23:36] What? What? What?
[23:38] I, being frank with you,
believe in God, dude.
[23:42] Listen,
[23:44] who are you calling dude?
[23:47] I don't like anyone being frank like this,
so talk to me with manners.
[23:52] I'm sorry, it was a mistake.
[23:56] Yes and I know very well,
why you keep making the same mistake.
[24:01] Why?
[24:02] Because you are finding excuses
to befriend me.
[24:05] And now that you have lost me
you regret it.
[24:08] Well you and Khawar a perfect pair,
[24:12] both of you are extremely
delusional about yourselves.
[24:15] You will suit each other,
best of luck.
[24:19] And I know very well
who you dream of.
[24:25] What do you mean?
[24:27] Oh hello?
[24:28] That fiancé of yours?
Your husband-to-be?
[24:31] Richest, most beautiful Khawar,
[24:34] go investigate after him.
Leave me alone.
[24:37] Always after me,
spoiled my mood.
[24:41] I’ve stopped pining
after you a long time ago,
[24:44] now I am only after my Khawar.
And he’s after me.
[24:49] Let me send him a picture of me.
[24:58] Oh wow, I feel so much better.
[25:03] I’ll sacrifice my life for my mother,
[25:05] there is magic in my mother’s hands.
[25:08] Oh mother,
I feel so relaxed.
[25:13] The way you’ve massaged my head,
[25:16] I feel like youth flowing
through me again.
[25:20] Mother, I don’t want to go back.
[25:23] Our country is our country.
[25:25] I don’t want to return.
[25:28] Then don’t return,
why are you going back,
[25:30] call your wife here as well.
[25:32] Oh that reminded me of,
how are her legs?
[25:36] She has such long legs mother.
[25:39] What do you mean?
Didn’t her leg fracture?
[25:42] Is it healed? What did the doctor say?
[25:44] It did fracture, her leg did fracture.
Then?
[25:47] The doctor joint it back again,
it was really hard but it is healed.
[25:51] And now she dances around the house.
[25:56] I had a wish that my elder daughter-in-law,
[26:01] the eldest daughter-in-law of this house should
do all the preparations under her supervision.
[26:06] Oh mother, don’t even worry about that,
[26:09] even from far away she has her eyes here.
[26:16] She has updates on everything.
[26:18] By the grace of God.
[26:20] Look everyone has certain good qualities,
[26:24] sweetie would have some too.
[26:26] A lot of good qualities mother,
a lot of good qualities.
[26:28] Uncle, here is your lassi.
[26:31] Oh, live long, live long.
Thank you, my child, thank you.
[26:36] Mother, what an aroma lassi
of my own country has.
[26:40] Okay now tell me,
what do you want for dinner?
[26:42] For dinner? Hold this.
[26:46] Mother, I want fenugreek,
spinach with meat.
[26:51] meat?
What a big deal.
[26:54] I’ll get it made.
Get it prepared.
[26:57] Really? You’ll prepare it?
Okay.
[27:01] Another thing,
for the breakfast.
[27:04] Mother.
Yes?
[27:06] I want the potato flatbreads.
[27:09] I’ll sacrifice for you.
[27:10] Not a problem uncle, I will get them
made early in the morning.
[27:13] You wake up early in the morning?
[27:14] I wake up at dawn.
[27:16] Live long, live long.
[27:17] Mother, I really like this girl
for my Mahir.
[27:22] Oh you said what was in my heart,
but what can I do?
[27:27] Every sane person
in this world likes her
[27:31] but your son on the other hand.
[27:33] He lacks some sense,
[27:35] he only sees imperfections
in this girl.
[27:39] I don’t know what standards
he has said for his wife,
[27:43] that my Rania does
not fall to his standards.
[27:47] He will never approve of this.
[27:49] Donkey’s offspring.
What?
[27:52] I mean extremely dumb.
Yes.
[27:57] It’s okay this way,
[27:58] I’m not dying after that crazy cat,
[28:01] I already don’t want to marry so soon.
[28:04] Because I want to be a prime minister.
[28:13] It is my bat, I will bat first.
[28:15] No.
What no?
[28:17] We’ll decide with the game.
There won’t be a game.
[28:20] Uncle why are you always crying?
[28:34] How much?
1000 rupees.
[28:36] What? That’s too much.
[28:37] No ma’am.
No, no, that’s too much,
[28:40] tell me the right fare.
[28:41] Madam petrol is getting expensive,
we have travelled a long distance.
[28:43] I only have this.
[28:44] No, no, give me 1000.
That’s a lot, this is all I got,
take this, go.
[28:49] Go, go, go.
[29:36] That’s the right address
[29:38] but which house is it?
This one or that one?
[29:47] Excuse me, excuse me,
can I help you?
[29:50] Yes, do you know
which one is grandmother’s
[29:54] I mean Azra Jahan begum’s house?
[29:58] This one or that one?
[30:00] Azra Jahan begum,
grandmother’s house.
[30:05] I know,
[30:06] I know, actually only one in the
whole neighborhood to know her house.
[30:10] I remember now, it’s there,
should we go?
[30:14] Do I look like someone without hands?
No.
[30:17] Then why did you carry my luggage,
I can pick it up myself.
[30:20] Actually don’t take it the wrong way,
[30:22] I get this feeling of responsibility
as a man whenever I see a woman.
[30:26] Actually my family’s customs,
traditions,
[30:30] and teachings tell us that
whenever you see woman,
[30:33] help her carry her things
and drop her home.
[30:36] Should we go?
[30:38] The woman looks attractive
[30:40] but how do I find out
if she is for my type or married?
[30:43] Ayaz, gather the strength,
gather the strength.
[30:46] You’re probably a guest?
[30:48] What kind of question is that?
[30:49] I am a guest that’s why I am asking
for the address to the house.,
[30:51] Does anyone ever ask for the address
of their own house from others?
[30:54] No, I meant to say you are all
alone in this big city,
[30:58] nobody accompanied you,
you’re alone, everything alright?
[31:02] So you belong to the category of man
[31:05] that cannot look at the girls
getting independent.
[31:08] Girls?
[31:11] You call yourself a girl,
[31:13] I think you are unmarried, right?
[31:16] So then?
[31:17] Oh my God.
I can’t say anything now.
[31:20] This is grandmother’s house,
it seems like you’re here for a while,
[31:24] your bag seems heavy.
No, only for a few days.
[31:27] I’ll work in a few days.
What?
[31:30] They are such nice people,
very respectable.
[31:32] I’ve met them, nice people.
[31:35] You can adjust inside?
Here’s your bag.
[31:40] Thank you.
[31:42] Go, go.
[31:50] Yes, yes, yes, yes, God.
[31:53] You’re the last hope,
my only hope,
[31:55] you’re the one to keep my respect,
my last hope.
[32:00] Why did you shut my mouth?
[32:03] I told you, you can’t do it,
I don’t want you to do it,
[32:07] I wanted to go to some
expensive salon.
[32:10] Have you gone mad?
[32:11] Brother Dabeer will have a heart attack
if he hears that.
[32:13] Haven’t you seen
how stingy he is?
[32:16] He has been saying his dollars.
[32:20] It’s okay if he does not give me money,
[32:22] I don’t have anything to do
with his dollars.
[32:25] If I ask My Darling Khawar,
he will get me anything.
[32:29] Shut up, it’s about our honor,
[32:32] what is he going to think about it,
we are that useless, we are poor,
[32:35] we cannot afford it?
[32:36] You don’t value your sister
am I sanding your face?
[32:39] Sister you have already ruined
the faces of the girls back and village,
[32:43] don’t do these experiments on me.
Shut your mouth,
[32:45] it does not look good, the facial
won’t work if you don’t stay quiet.
[32:48] You keep going on and on.
[32:58] How did you come here?
[33:00] How did you like my surprise?
[33:01] I loved it.
[33:04] Do you know Rani
how much I missed you?
[33:06] Do you know
how much I missed you?
[33:09] I’m so happy.
[33:16] Mona.
Hi.
[33:18] Bebo.
[33:19] Bebo it wasn’t a surprise
it was a heart attack.
[33:22] Hello.
[33:24] Greetings.
[33:25] Hello.
[33:34] Asia my child,
Yes uncle?
[33:37] ask bebo, did she reach or not?
[33:42] Uncle Bebo called,
she has reached safely.
[33:46] And our Rani is also very happy
to see her.
[33:49] It proved to be a really good surprise.
[33:50] Okay, thank God.
[33:55] It must be the tuition students,
I’ll beat them today,
[33:58] I told them to get here on time and
they always come before the time.
[34:20] Aren’t you going to invite me in?
[34:25] Asia.
[34:29] Do you remember my name?
[34:33] Thank you.
[34:36] I thought you must’ve forgotten it.
[34:43] I’m really ashamed Asia.
[34:47] I’m here to apologize.
[34:50] For what?
[34:53] Asia my child, who’s there?
[34:57] Father,
[34:59] my father.
[35:16] Father,
[35:23] father.
[35:30] Who are you,
[35:34] I couldn’t recognize.
[35:37] Father,
[35:39] what are you saying, father.
[35:43] Father, I’m Zaman,
[35:50] your Zaman.
[35:53] Father, I made a great mistake,
[35:56] forgive me, father.
[35:59] It was a really big mistake, father.
[36:03] I still regret it.
[36:07] Please forgive me.
[36:10] You’re among big people,
[36:15] with a lot of money.
[36:21] Why are you apologizing
to a small man like me?
[36:27] You’re embarrassing me,
[36:32] we...
[36:36] We don’t have anything to give you.
[36:38] Go,
[36:41] go back to your world.
[36:44] Father,
[36:47] father, I came here with a lot of hope,
[36:50] please forgive me.
[36:52] I’m really hopeless,
[36:55] really lonely.
[36:59] Father at least ask what happened to me
in all those years.
[37:04] Did you ever think,
[37:08] you left a young girl
[37:11] and an infant daughter
what happened to them?
[37:21] That, in your life,
[37:25] she’s been living like your widow.
[37:28] Your daughter thinks you are dead.
[37:34] And you really are dead for us,
[37:40] dead do not return.
[37:45] We don’t have any space
for you in our lives.
[37:51] Father I made a mistake,
[37:54] a really big mistake,
please forgive me.
[37:58] We bore the consequences
of your mistake.
[38:05] You rejected my child
she bore the pain for that.
[38:14] We don’t have any place
for you in our hearts.
[38:20] Father,
[38:23] father for God’s sake.
[38:25] Don’t test my patience.
[38:28] Go away.
[38:37] Asia,
[38:39] for God’s sake listen to me.
[38:44] The gate is open.
