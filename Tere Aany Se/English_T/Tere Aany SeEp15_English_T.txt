[00:20] Grandmother,
[00:23] grandmother
[00:24] Where is grandmother?
[00:25] She's sleeping in her room.
[00:27] If you need something you can tell me.
This Rania, this girl.
[00:31] Calling her a girl is
an insult to all girls.
[00:33] She is a witch that roams around
in our home.
[00:36] She's always having meetings
with useless people.
[00:39] There is Mona, look at her.
[00:41] I've never seen her having meetings
with random people.
[00:44] Whenever I see her she's sitting
somewhere quietly,
[00:46] and doesn't talk to anyone.
[00:47] But that Rania,
[00:49] makes relationships with everyone.
[00:52] She's a stupid girl.
[00:54] That means, you have a lot of
complaints about Rania.
[00:58] You don't like her at all?
[01:00] So what is so good about it?
[01:02] You won't understand,
it's a deep thought.
[01:04] Look at Mona, she understood
because my Mona is very smart.
[01:09] She understands the depth of things.
[01:11] No matter who I talk to, everyone
becomes a philosopher in this home.
[01:15] I'm going to my friend's house.
[01:16] Inform grandmother
when she wakes up.
[01:19] Don't worry about me.
[01:20] Don't worry,
[01:22] our Mona will manage everything
in your absence.
[01:24] I'm going to my friend's house,
not to a war or a heist.
[01:28] "She'll manage everything".
[01:30] Then why do you look like
an angry bird?
[01:31] Because, because I'm angry.
[01:34] On Rania?
[01:39] All of our assumptions were wrong,
there is no such thing like that.
[01:42] Doesn't matter, he doesn't have
a thing with me either.
[01:45] Are you deaf?
[01:47] He was admiring you,
Mona this, Mona that.
[01:49] Didn't you hear that,
stupid girl.
[01:51] Listen to me,
[01:52] that will increase eventually,
that's how it all starts.
[01:56] Sure?
[01:57] Yes, God promise.
[01:59] Yes.
[02:00] I was thinking if I should go
and get ready.
[02:02] What else do we need
to do to get ready?
[02:04] If I apply a little blush
I'll look better.
[02:16] Wow man.
What is it?
[02:18] You look delighted today.
[02:20] Even you look happier today.
[02:22] I'm always happy, nothing new.
[02:26] Won't be happy for long.
[02:30] She doesn't even know
but Mahir thinks about her.
[02:34] Can I go and tell her if you let me?
[02:38] No, you'll get the evil eye.
[02:39] Have you gone mad?
Do not make a mistake like this.
[02:41] She'll start to compete
with you out of jealousy.
[02:44] We have to win over
such people with love.
[02:47] Just once your relationship is finalized
so I'll get rid of all my worries.
[02:52] I'll ask Hammad to talk to mother
in subtle hints in a day or two.
[02:57] And when mother is convinced,
our game will succeed.
[03:00] And yes, try to get the sympathy
of this social worker.
[03:04] She'll help you win over Mahir.
[03:07] I was thinking should I send him
my TikTok?
[03:11] Yes, yes.
Here
[03:13] Let's make it.
Take a selfie first.
[03:15] Yes.
[03:31] What happened?
[03:33] Hey brother?
[03:35] What happened?
Why is your face so dull?
[03:39] Something happened right?
Tell me.
[03:41] What do I tell you, man.
[03:42] Ifrah is mad at me,
girls have a different psyche.
[03:45] If they love someone, they get mad
at him and they ignore him.
[03:49] She talks a lot,
it's all so strange.
[03:54] Rania also ignores me,
[03:56] and gets mad at me as well.
[03:58] Does that mean
Rania also loves me?
[04:05] What is there to smile about?
[04:08] No, nothing.
[04:10] Listen to me,
[04:11] nobody can understand girls
better than me.
[04:15] You should start ignoring
Ifrah right back,
[04:17] don't receive her calls,
and show some attitude.
[04:20] Then you will see how
she comes running after you.
[04:23] Brother, keep such suggestions
to yourself for God's sake, okay?
[04:27] If you had ever loved someone
then you'd talk about it.
[04:33] Getting mad, showing attitude
is a right of a beloved.
[04:38] And making up to them is
a lover's responsibility.
[04:42] Brother, look. You don't need to love
in order to advise other people.
[04:46] Haven't you watched it
in the movies?
[04:48] When a hero is giving
his girl an attitude,
[04:50] she falls deeply in love with him.
[04:53] Just for once take my advice
and then you'll see,
[04:56] how Ifrah will get crazy after you.
[05:00] You're always up to talk about movies.
[05:03] Dude, just try it once.
[05:04] And brighten up, and chill.
[05:08] How can we chill?
[05:16] Don't make karhai extra spicy
[05:19] Just make sure the meat is properly tender
[05:21] because if it takes a lot to chew it
loses the taste.
[05:25] Okay?
[05:29] What are you looking at my face?
Go my brother, leave.
[05:32] Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[05:34] Get me the phone.
[05:38] Hurry.
[05:40] I should also get you that thing
to scratch the itch.
[05:43] Because if you move your hand you'll lose
some weight and might get tired as well.
[05:48] Yeah, give.
[05:49] If you want, do I also scratch?
It'll reach there.
[05:51] Oh no, no, no, no.
I'll do it myself, I'll do it.
[05:59] Hammad.
[06:00] Stop this music,
I need to talk to you urgently.
[06:04] I'm listening, speak.
[06:09] I'll be listening with my ears.
[06:15] Yes?
[06:17] You'll go to mother and talk about
Mahir and Mona's relationship.
[06:23] Listen to me, it's your and
your sister's matter,
[06:26] keep me away from him.
[06:28] Hammad.
Oh God.
[06:32] You are talking like this relationship
won't benefit you in any way.
[06:36] It's not easy to marry that obnoxious
and arrogant man.
[06:40] My sister is ready for this sacrifice.
[06:44] And also ready to jump in a hell
named Mahir.
[06:48] Okay so tell her to jump
[06:51] but I won’t talk to mother,
[06:54] I'm already so tired after explaining
everything to Shehenshah.
[06:59] Wife, wife, listen to me.
[07:02] If I go and talk to mother about this,
[07:06] her answer will end up insulting me.
[07:10] Mona is pretty clever,
tell her to try herself.
[07:14] It won't be difficult for her to get
a simple guy like Mahir.
[07:21] Just like how you got me.
[07:24] Just tell her to trap Mahir,
[07:27] and spare me, I won't talk
to mother, not me.
[07:31] I am done saying
what I wanted to say,
[07:34] and you only do
what I told you to.
[07:36] Understand?
[07:43] I am starving.
[07:47] I'm so glad you visited,
I was missing you a lot.
[07:52] Are you alright?
You're fine?
[07:54] Yes grandmother,
I'm really happy.
[07:57] Today, at the breakfast table,
uncle said
[08:00] you didn't visit your family in a while.
[08:02] Go, meet them, and Khawar was available
so he said he'll take me.
[08:07] Actually Arbab is going out of town,
[08:10] he's starting a new project.
[08:13] And you know who'll manage it?
Our Khawar.
[08:18] Really?
[08:19] Yes.
[08:20] Wow, congratulations son, good job.
[08:23] Yes grandmother, that's why we thought,
let's bring fruits and sweets to celebrate.
[08:27] Son, there was no need for it,
we have enough fruits at home.
[08:32] We brought it with our choice.
[08:34] Oh, great people are visiting today.
[08:37] How are you?
I'm good, you tell.
[08:40] You look really pretty.
[08:42] You too.
[08:43] Khawar, how are you?
[08:44] All good thanks to God,
we've started a new project
[08:47] so we're here to get blessings
from grandmother.
[08:49] By the grace of God,
[08:52] such a beautiful mindset you have.
[08:53] Men should be working like this.
[08:56] Men who are not doing anything
are a burden on this earth.
[08:59] So now that you're earning,
I'd suggest get married.
[09:04] See, he got shy.
[09:07] Well, being shy is a trait of pious men.
[09:10] The men who don't change
an expression are already lousy.
[09:14] No grandmother? Am I saying
something wrong?
[09:16] Oh that's right, listen to me
[09:18] Call Mahir, tell him that Saman
and Khawar are here,
[09:21] come and greet the guests,
what is he doing?
[09:24] Sure, it'll get him.
Yes, go.
[09:27] Why are you sitting here?
[09:28] We have guests over, go arrange
some tea or snacks.
[09:31] Go now.
[09:33] So son, will you stay here for work
or you'll move to another city?
[09:37] Yes if brother says so I'll have to go,
otherwise I'm here.
[09:42] By the grace of God.
[09:44] Our Khawar is very obedient.
[09:46] Yes, why not, why not.
[09:56] Oh wow, Mr. Mahir.
[10:00] Such personality you've got.
[10:02] Thank you God,
thank you so much.
[10:05] Girls don't wish for getting
you for no reason.
[10:11] But the moon isn't written
in everyone's fate.
[10:20] I think,
[10:22] this Rania is also into me.
[10:25] Probably that's why she keeps getting
into arguments with me.
[10:28] She's looking for the excuses
to talk to me.
[10:31] She wants my attention,
[10:34] I understand everything.
[10:39] Come on in.
[10:40] Come on out.
[10:43] Why?
[10:45] Do you want to go out with me?
[10:49] Didn't I tell you?
[10:51] I don't need you
in order to go out.
[10:55] Sister Saman is here and
her in-laws as well,
[10:57] so please come and greet them.
[10:59] Is that it? Or are you going
to ask anything else as well?
[11:01] What am I going to get by asking
anything to you?
[11:05] I don't have time for
irrelevant arguments,
[11:08] or I would have answered in detail.
[11:10] Okay, I won't argue with you,
[11:14] I'll accept your answer.
[11:15] Well I'm understanding all of this.
[11:18] Arguing with me on petty issues,
[11:21] fighting,
[11:23] interfering in my matters.
[11:27] Why don't you say it clearly?
[11:30] That you.
Oh God,
[11:34] I don't have time to hear
your newsletter.
[11:37] Everyone is waiting for you
at the table so please come.
[11:39] And yes, everyone is really happy,
[11:43] keep the use of your tongue
as minimum as possible.
[11:46] Just please don't ruin anything, okay?
[11:49] Come on now.
[11:56] That's also her way.
[12:00] Thank you God.
[12:03] What a personality I've got.
[12:05] Hey go and.
[12:07] Listen to me, go get Seema
and her sister.
[12:10] Or else later she'll say
we didn't even ask her.
[12:14] Sit down.
[12:15] Mother, both the sisters
have gone shopping.
[12:19] Their shopping never ends.
[12:22] Okay, Khawar tell me,
are you interested in work?
[12:27] We have to take interest
in work grandmother.
[12:29] Ask sister-in-law,
how hardworking I am.
[12:31] Yes, he's absolutely right.
[12:34] Grandmother, he's such a
hardworking boy.
[12:35] See, how fortunate Rafique Ahmed is.
[12:39] He got rich and yet how respecting
and hardworking his children are.
[12:44] Not like our offspring.
[12:49] Okay mother, I should get going.
[12:51] Why? Is it past your bedtime?
Sit here quietly.
[12:53] We have guests over,
at least consider that.
[12:55] Rabail my child make tea.
[12:59] Oh, Rabail will do it, leave it.
[13:02] You make it, at least care
about something.
[13:05] Khawar, take the snacks,
fresh and hot snacks.
[13:09] No grandmother.
[13:11] Here you go.
Just a bite.
[13:12] No, no.
Have it.
[13:16] Listen to me, don't rush to go back.
[13:21] Instead, be comfortable,
go after dinner.
[13:26] Grandmother, there are other people
in this house as well.
[13:28] Whom you could ask for snacks.
[13:31] You also only think about yourself
like your uncle.
[13:38] Grandmother, I've taken an oath
[13:40] that I'll take my business to such heights
that the world will admire.
[13:44] Wow, think like that,
[13:47] there is no limit to imagination.
[13:48] What I have to say is, uncle set up a factory
or two in your imagination as well.
[13:57] You made really good tea.
[14:00] Are you still sleepy?
I think mother, now I should get going.
[14:07] Oh, grandmother, it's a business call,
I have to attend to this.
[14:11] Oh, it's a business call?
Yes.
[14:13] It's for work?
Yes.
[14:16] Hello?
[14:47] Mona, why are you sitting here?
[14:53] You look a little upset,
what happened?
[14:58] I'm going back.
[15:00] So soon?
[15:03] Yes, because it doesn't matter
if I live here or not.
[15:07] Mahir disappointed me a lot.
[15:09] He didn't even consider
our childhood friendship.
[15:12] And he became so arrogant
and forgot everything.
[15:17] Then why should I
stay here anymore?
[15:19] Hey, that's it?
[15:21] And you're disappointed so soon?
[15:24] Mahir isn't as arrogant
as he seems like.
[15:28] If you talk to him calmly, with love,
he understands.
[15:34] Okay, let me try once?
[15:37] But don't go till then, please stay.
Please.
[15:41] You, you're going to talk
to him for me?
[15:44] You'll convince him?
[15:46] Yes,
[15:47] I'll do anything it takes to get you
both together. I swear.
[15:52] I want to be a prime minister.
This is a small issue.
[15:57] Just remember that
we're friends from now on.
[15:59] You have a friend named Rania
in this world that'll make Mahir yours.
[16:05] Thank you so much Rania,
you're really sweet.
[16:09] Thank you,
I knew that already.
[16:12] What?
[16:13] That I'm sweet.
[16:16] Listen to me, when you'll
go to talk to him.
[16:25] No Salik, I'm not coming today.
[16:27] Grandmother taunted me in such
a sweet manner today.
[16:30] What do I say, it killed the mood.
[16:32] Grandmother taunted you?
That's surprising.
[16:34] Not only that, she taunted me
in front of everyone.
[16:38] Looks like you got insulted
in front of Rania
[16:40] and that's why you're upset.
Right?
[16:42] Dude, I don't know what do you have
against her?
[16:44] If you look at her from my point of view,
she's a great person.
[16:47] Leave that Rania,
[16:49] tell me is Ifrah talking to you again?
[16:52] Brother, all good, all good.
[16:54] I'll say, you're an expert
in these matters.
[16:58] You were right.
[16:59] Girls only show attitude till
we give them attention,
[17:02] and once you stop giving them
the attention,
[17:06] they'll settle down.
[17:08] And about Ifrah,
[17:10] her anger is settled,
she's running after me.
[17:14] And it all happened because of you,
[17:16] thank you because you've really
helped me brother.
[17:19] When you follow brother's advice,
you'll always.
[17:23] Hey, I'll call you later.
[17:24] Okay then we'll meet later.
[17:35] For how long are you going
to smile for?
[17:36] You'll get tired.
[17:38] Confess what you have in your heart.
[17:40] No, there is nothing special.
[17:44] I just came here randomly.
[17:46] I thought you might be rotting
in the room
[17:48] so I should give you company.
Really?
[17:51] I was just thinking about you.
[17:53] Really? See,
[17:55] the devil's name
and the devil appear.
[17:57] No, no, I won't call you a devil.
[18:02] Do you know,
[18:04] I had all the wrong assumptions
about you,
[18:07] you're not like that at all.
[18:09] Really?
[18:10] What did you assume about me?
[18:16] I used to think you're full of yourself
and not good for anything.
[18:22] And your personality is extremely misbehaving,
shameless, and inconsiderate.
[18:27] And I had decided that I'll be the one
to teach him a lesson.
[18:35] Why are you making such faces,
[18:38] I'm telling you,
they were just assumptions.
[18:41] And congratulations to you,
for the first time in my life,
[18:44] my assumptions were wrong.
[18:46] I swear.
[18:55] The weather outside is really nice,
[18:58] such a refreshing breeze.
Let's go to the lawn?
[19:01] I'll also make tea for you.
[19:05] Okay,
[19:07] you want me to come
to the lawn with you?
[19:11] Yes,
[19:14] let's go?
Okay.
[19:17] Okay.
[19:24] Let's go?
[19:26] Stupid girl, she's thinking
I'm enchanted by her.
[19:34] And I'm singing songs in her love.
[19:39] She's so mistaken.
[19:53] Ms. Rania,
[19:55] I'll make fun of you so bad,
[19:58] that you'd hide from everyone.
[20:15] Application for leave.
[20:17] Respected Madam Sweetie.
[20:21] It is my kind request that on February.
[20:25] February? Oh again,
[20:29] he wants to have days off from
work so he could meet his family.
[20:33] Please accept his absence
for a few days.
[20:43] Sincerely, your servant.
[20:49] Dabeer Ahmed.
[20:52] It was such a small thing and Dabeer
you were scared for no reason.
[20:57] Look at this,
[21:01] now I'll put this on her bedside.
[21:04] She'll read this application
and sign just like this.
[21:13] Now go Dabeer, prepare for it,
[21:17] you don't know when the moment
of acceptance would be.
[21:26] Very kind of you.
[21:28] Bye.
[21:41] Anything special?
[21:43] You wanted to tell me
in this pleasant environment?
[21:45] Carry on.
[21:47] Everything I say is special.
Okay.
[21:51] So randomly I was thinking,
[21:54] now even your friends are getting married.
[21:57] And Salik and Ifrah are
so happy together.
[22:01] And grandmother,
grandmother is happy as well.
[22:06] And their mothers?
[22:07] They'll extremely happy.
[22:10] Yes right, I know, then?
[22:16] Oh, nothing,
[22:20] I was thinking
[22:24] don't give everyone
the similar happiness as well?
[22:30] Oh,
[22:31] she came to the point too soon.
[22:36] No, no, I've thought
[22:40] if anyone confesses their love for me,
[22:42] I'll not disappoint them.
[22:45] Instead I'll answer that with love.
[22:48] Really?
[22:50] You ended up being a really good person,
[22:52] I was calling you names for no reason.
[22:55] Poisonous snake, arrogant horse,
[22:58] stubborn donkey.
Hey, that’s enough,
[23:00] that’s enough respect.
[23:03] Hello.
[23:05] Farhad?
[23:06] Are you here to teach the children?
Yes.
[23:10] Wait for me right here,
I’ll get him to the children.
[23:15] Stay here, okay?
[23:17] Come.
[23:20] Mona, I succeeded, the way is clear,
go shoot your shot.
[23:24] Yes.
Go.
[23:28] Poisonous snake?
[23:30] She’s a poisonous snake.
[23:31] Escaped the situation
by crawling away.
[23:37] Hey Mona, get off me.
[23:40] Hey, you recognize it’s me even
with your eyes closed?
[23:44] Today I had a really important mission,
[23:46] for which I forgave Mahir and
became friends with him.
[23:49] See, my curse affected you,
[23:53] at the end, you’re in love with him, right?
[23:55] Hey?
[23:56] I am yet to have such terrible days.
[23:58] What happened?
What?
[24:01] The weather is so pleasant, right?
[24:03] This is pleasant?
It’s so sunny I feel hot.
[24:07] Yes,
[24:08] but one can capture really good pictures
in this sunlight, our pictures.
[24:11] Go and get a picture with that tree,
the selfie will look good, go.
[24:15] Really? Why? He’s cute,
[24:18] I think many girls would die on him,
nobody would live though.
[24:20] What do I do, die if they want to die.
[24:23] My mindset is way beyond marriage.
[24:26] I want to be something
after getting the education,
[24:28] and I want to do something
for my country.
[24:30] Very nice.
[24:31] Come along with me,
we’ll get really good pictures.
[24:34] Okay then, let’s go.
[24:45] What are you looking at?
[24:46] Pictures will look better from this side,
go there.
[24:53] What are they talking about
for so long?
[24:56] Listen, I don’t have the knowledge
of every living being,
[24:58] I don’t know.
[25:00] She looks really happy with this boy,
I don’t know why.
[25:02] Because that boy makes her happy
[25:07] if someone makes me happy like this.
I’d look happier and glow even more.
[25:12] Listen if you’re done with the inquiry
then can we decide the spot to take pictures.
[25:16] Shut up at least.
[25:17] I don’t know what they were talking
and laughing about, for so long.
[25:21] This guy is such a pervert,
I don’t like him at all.
[25:24] Oh God,
[25:26] but I like you a lot.
[25:32] Go away.
Listen.
[25:36] He didn’t even say bye.
[25:37] Okay bye.
[25:44] Where are you planning
to slip all secretly?
[25:48] No, no, Madam Sweetie,
not secretly,
[25:51] I’ve written a proper application
for leave.
[25:57] Yes, this one, this is the one I wrote.
[26:00] Not accepted,
not accepted.
[26:03] Your request for leave is not accepted.
[26:05] I’d written it with.
[26:07] Go put this bag back
where you took it from.
[26:11] Madam Sweetie,
[26:15] there should have been a leave to meet
our loved ones at least once after so many years.
[26:24] Am I not your beloved?
[26:26] While trapping me and promising me
for marriage 20 years ago,
[26:31] didn’t I say you’d do everything
according to my choice?
[26:35] Then do this thing,
[26:37] send me away from the country
with your own will,
[26:40] just like how you throw me
out of the bedroom.
[26:45] Shouldn’t I throw you
to the police station?
[26:48] All it is going to take is a phone call.
[26:52] That this illiterate man was beating me.
[26:58] Please, I was kidding Madam Sweetie,
it was a joke.
[27:02] You’re really jolly Mr. Dabeer.
[27:04] You’re also really fake.
[27:06] Really jolly, jolly.
[27:10] I was joking,
[27:13] I was joking,
I’m not going anywhere.
[27:22] Dabeer, come here and
bring your suitcase.
[27:26] Yes? Yes, coming, coming.
[27:34] Sister, Saman told me that
you’ve been missing me,
[27:37] I told Khawar to get
the new big car.
[27:41] Sister missed me,
we have to reach there.
[27:44] You’ve bought another car?
[27:46] Yes grandmother, this time,
it’s a result of my hard work.
[27:51] Okay then,
[27:53] let me give you a gift
for your hard work.
[27:57] Rafique Ahmed,
[27:59] I don’t just say it, I truly value Khawar,
and think of him as my son.
[28:08] That’s why I am thinking,
[28:11] there should’ve been someone
to take care of him
[28:14] The one who’d give him chicken with
original butter, so he could get healthy.
[28:21] You’re absolutely right.
[28:23] Uncle, how many teaspoons of sugar?
[28:25] Oh my child, add 3-4 of them.
[28:27] Okay.
[28:28] And for that reason, Rafique Ahmed,
[28:31] after a lot of thinking and analysing
the situation I’ve come to decide
[28:35] that I want to get him married
to my daughter,
[28:37] I want him to get together with Rabail,
[28:41] if you do not object.
[29:00] Sister, am I awake?
[29:04] I mean, am I dreaming?
[29:07] Oh, you were never going to think about it
so I decided on my own,
[29:13] that along with Saman,
I want Rabail to go to the same family.
[29:20] Thank you so much, sister. I’m indebted.
[29:23] Hey, go get sister’s blessings and love.
[29:28] Live long, live long, my son.
[29:36] Oh stop it, if you stir it so much
the tea will turn into a juice.
[29:40] Grandmother,
[29:43] I want to say something to you.
[29:45] I know you’re always there
to ruin everything,
[29:47] so keep quiet,
I’ve made my decisions.
[29:50] Mother-in-law,
I want to say something as well.
[29:52] I know about you too,
how sweetly you speak, right?
[29:56] You go and wake your husband to tell him
that mother made another amazing decision,
[30:03] completing her hat trick.
[30:06] Yes.
[30:08] Mahir, go get some sweets,
so we could give it a sweet start.
[30:15] Go, get going.
[30:17] Sister, I’ve lost my senses after this amazing
decision of yours, all of them.
[30:25] Rania, call Rabail.
[30:29] She has been to neighbors,
[30:32] unaware of the unfortunate future
she’s discussing the present with them.
[30:40] I’ll go get her.
[30:43] Show me your finger,
in which one does the ring go?
[30:47] It’ll fit this one,
hey I’ve decided it
[30:50] and made a commitment now
the discussion is complete.
[30:53] Consider this an engagement ring.
[31:03] Stop it sister, how much are you
going to cry?
[31:07] Why do the elders always play with the
feelings of emotions of young generation?
[31:11] I don’t understand why?
[31:12] It’s not like the new generation asked them
before starting a relationship.
[31:15] I won’t get married to Khawar.
[31:18] How can grandmother do that to me?
It’s very cruel.
[31:24] Stop crying Rabail.
[31:26] How my brother dreamt
of the days.
[31:30] Have you started a drama?
[31:33] We won’t get anything by crying.
[31:35] We have to think practically
in this scenario.
[31:38] Think practically?
What do you mean?
[31:40] I’m not the one to cry
and do nothing.
[31:43] And I can do anything
for my friends.
[31:47] Do anything you want
but please hurry.
[31:49] I’ll forever be indebted to you,
please.
[31:54] Let me think.
[31:56] Yes, think.
[31:57] Did you think of something?
No.
[32:01] Didn’t think of anything.
[32:05] Now?
No.
[32:13] What are you doing?
Go sit there, sit there,
[32:16] sit quietly.
[32:20] There is one thing for sure,
I won’t let this happen.
[32:24] A life partner should be one
who you like. Right?
[32:27] Yes.
[32:31] Rabail, do you like him?
Yes.
[32:35] Look closely.
[32:37] Yes.
[32:40] You like her?
Yes.
[32:42] Do you love each other?
Yes.
[32:45] Okay then,
[32:47] I’ll help you both get together.
[32:51] I will.
[33:01] Grandmother, I can’t even believe it.
[33:03] How can you think like that?
[33:05] How can you even think about making a guy
as dumb as Khawar a son-in-law of this house?
[33:10] Even actual parents disown such kids.
[33:13] Think about it, that alien being
the son-in-law.
[33:17] Grandmother, I’m telling you,
this is not happening.
[33:20] I’ll protest against it.
Stop it, “dumb”.
[33:25] That dumb boy is a better
businessman than you.
[33:28] Extremely responsible
and innocent child.
[33:31] He is not surviving on
his father’s money.
[33:33] He earns for himself.
[33:35] And doesn’t even raise his head
in front of me.
[33:37] That’s how I want my son-in-laws
to be for our daughters,
[33:39] the one’s we can dominate.
[33:41] Accept our superiority
[33:43] and keep our daughters respected
and loved forever.
[33:46] Grandmother,
what logic is this?
[33:49] I accepted brother Arbab
when you insisted
[33:52] but not Khawar.
[33:53] I will never let it happen,
grandmother.
[33:55] You have to change your decision.
[33:57] I’m a family woman,
I don’t go against my word.
[34:01] Okay, don’t listen to him,
[34:04] but at least ask Rabail first.
[34:06] If she even agrees to this relationship.
[34:08] I’m not going to ask anyone,
[34:11] I’ve made my decision and
now we’re done taking.
[34:14] Grandmother,
[34:15] grandmother you’re being really cruel.
[34:17] I’ll never let this happen.
[34:19] When Saman got married,
I was young, not wise enough.
[34:22] Now I’m an adult, I have friends,
I have a social circle,
[34:25] what are they going
to think about it?
[34:27] Look at Mahir’s standard
and his class,
[34:29] and look at his brother-in-law,
an alien.
[34:33] Rabail doesn’t agree to this marriage.
[34:35] And if Rabail doesn’t agree,
I’ll also never let this happen.
[34:38] You won’t let this happen?
[34:39] Really? What are you going to do?
[34:41] Not only me, you’ll help me as well.
[34:44] We’ll go to this Khawar’s house,
[34:46] and first explain him nicely to say
no to this relationship.
[34:48] And if he doesn’t accept then.
Then.
[34:50] Then we’ll resort to threats.
[34:52] Girls are being treated like
silent animals even in this era.
[34:57] Their marriages are fixed
without their consent.
[35:00] It’s cruel, it’s pure cruelty.
[35:02] Okay, okay, calm down.
[35:05] We’ll go, okay?
[35:17] Wow, wow.
What a move you made.
[35:21] Oh, welcome, welcome.
[35:23] Come on, be seated.
[35:25] This man is my brother-in-law and.
[35:28] Greetings mister.
Greetings madam.
[35:30] May God bless your pair,
may God bless you with a cute.
[35:33] Enough, stop, stop.
[35:35] Hit the brakes don’t say a word
beyond that.
[35:40] What should I get for you people?
[35:43] Ask for a slipper,
[35:45] so you can be whopped
when needed.
[35:48] Allah Rakhi, get two cups of coffee.
[35:50] Okay.
[35:52] I always wished my sister-in-law
to be humorous,
[35:56] and what a joke you made, slippers.
[36:01] I admire your sense of humor.
[36:03] Hey brother-in-law, why are you quiet?
[36:05] You can also chip in, I won’t mind.
[36:09] Wow,
[36:12] today you changed your skin
just like a snake.
[36:16] We used to think you don’t even have
a tongue in that mouth.
[36:21] Earlier you were my brother’s in-laws,
[36:23] now that you’re my in-laws as well,
I feel like a family.
[36:27] You know,
my confidence level increased.
[36:31] Rania, tell him why we are here.
[36:35] What?
[36:37] Say no to this relationship.
