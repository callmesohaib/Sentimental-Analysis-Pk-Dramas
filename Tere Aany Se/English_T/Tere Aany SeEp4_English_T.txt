[00:26] Ah, my new car!
oh wow
[00:31] Whose car is this? Is it yours?
[00:35] I mean I don’t have car service station
[00:38] so if a car this big is standing
in my lawn it must be mine
[00:43] If you have such a big car,
[00:45] then why were you on the bus
the other day?
[00:47] That was just fate making sure
[00:50] that I saw your real face
who you really are.
[00:56] Yeah, so listen,
[00:58] will you teach me how to drive?
[01:01] Teach you? No, I’ll buy you one
[01:05] All you will have to do is just pull
the thread and it’ll move on its own
[01:09] Haha
[01:10] look at yourself you can’t handle a car,
get a bike or something
[01:18] if you have one, I’ll get one too
[01:24] Wait a second, that means she's.."
[01:30] Nonsense!
[01:32] She thinks she’s on my level,
[01:35] people can be so delusional sometimes
[01:39] Don’t you worry, you will have fun.
[01:47] Greetings, Mian Sahab,
how is everyone?
[01:49] How’s mom and Bebo?
[01:51] everything’s alright here
[01:54] just it’s been very quiet here
since you left
[01:59] There are so many voices here
Mian Sahab
[02:03] but none of them are yours
or mom’s or bebe’s
[02:07] My heart‘s been sad too
[02:08] Yeah, but don’t you forget!
[02:11] you are there for a reason
[02:14] you have to study hard and make
your headmaster grandpa proud
[02:21] hopefully.
[02:22] to be honest the bright lights here
almost blinded me
[02:31] I am so used to your love
and kindness
[02:33] that I couldn’t even bear
a harsh comment,
[02:36] but it’s better now
[02:38] By the way,
is everything okay with you?
[02:40] yes, everything is perfectly alright,
[02:42] Ammaji is like a carbon copy of yours
and everyone else is nice as well
[02:46] And you know me,
[02:49] I am prone to building my own world;
[02:51] I'll make everyone like me,
[02:55] and those who aren't in my favour,
[02:57] I'll let them know
I am not to be messed with.
[03:00] But anyway, tell me what Mom
and Aunt are doing.
[03:03] Get them on the phone
[03:06] Your mother, I believe, is praying,
and Bebu is in the kitchen cooking.
[03:11] I can get them if you want
[03:13] no no, you stay put,
[03:16] i’ll talk to them tonight
but give them my regards.
[03:19] okay look,
[03:22] we sent you before
your result came out
[03:24] you have plenty of time
[03:27] to look at different universities
so you can take admission
[03:32] Don’t you worry; I'll do it,
[03:34] and you know Rabail?
[03:38] Ammaji’s granddaughter;
she’ll help me out.
[03:40] take care
okay Mian Sahab,
[03:42] I’ll talk to you later.
[03:44] Bye
Bye.
[03:53] Hammad, put your phone away.
[03:56] I have to talk to you about
something important.
[03:58] I am listening.
[03:59] I swear Hammad one day
I’ll lose my patience
[04:02] and either I’ll break this phone
or your head
[04:08] why do you get so hyper for no reason?
[04:11] I am utterly focused on
whatever you have to say.
[04:14] Hammad, tell me
[04:17] why do you think Ammaji has
invited this girl to our house?
[04:22] There's no reason to invite
your relatives to your house,
[04:27] they just come and go.
[04:29] I think something’s up
[04:32] what?
[04:33] I think Ammaji has her
in mind for Mahir.
[04:36] no no, it’s nothing like that,
she’s only here to get an education.
[04:42] I don’t know, you have to make sure
Mona’s chances remain intact.
[04:48] that girl is way too innocent to compete
with mona’s cleverness.
[04:55] Hammad!
[04:56] at least allow me to speak my truth.
[04:59] My poor sister is willing to marry
[05:03] that rude nephew of yours just for our sake
and what are you saying about her?
[05:09] My sister is very innocent
[05:12] oh yes she’s innocent, just like you.
[05:16] Nice and innocent.
[05:30] Uncle, do you want me
to bring you lunch?
[05:33] oh no, not right now
[05:37] I don’t feel like it.
[05:40] Rania’s been gone for only two days,
and you’re already getting sad.
[05:44] I called her
[05:46] What did she say?
How is she?
[05:48] Does she miss us?
[05:49] it’s her first time being
so far away from us
[05:52] she’s very brave and courageous,
[05:55] she can handle herself
[05:57] That she is.
[06:00] she said she’ll call tonight
to talk to you and Bebo
[06:05] Nice,
[06:06] You should call your sister
and ask how's everything
[06:11] who knows what our little devil
has done yet.
[06:16] No, no, my Rania is very smart,
[06:20] and she knows what to do.
I explained it all to her.
[06:24] if you don’t feel like eating
I can make you some tea
[06:25] tea sounds good
well smile then, don’t be sad
[06:29] I am not that sad.
[06:39] you didn’t negotiate with
the shopkeeper at all,
[06:43] you just handed him all the money
[06:47] You do realize money doesn't grow
on trees, do you?
[06:49] It seems like it does.
What do you mean?
[06:52] Ammaji and Brother Mahir told me
not to bargain for these small things,
[06:59] it’s a norm for poor people and
we are the elite, it doesn't suit us
[07:01] I swear this Mahir Sahab of yours
is so insufferable
[07:04] go, go
the kids are back
[07:07] go, quickly
[07:10] Hey you, stop, now!
[07:14] Can’t you see? He didn’t even get off
and you started moving
[07:18] you shameless man.
[07:19] Oh, ma'am, they do it every day;
they are well-practiced.
[07:22] we don’t send our kids to a circus,
[07:24] if you ever do such a thing again
I swear i’ll make you regret it
[07:30] Don’t you dare come here
asking for you fee,
[07:32] you’re not getting anything
from us this month
[07:33] what are you saying the kid
is perfectly fine
[07:37] Let’s go
[07:38] wait a second,
what happened?
[07:41] he pushed the kid out
of a moving vehicle
[07:43] He did what?
[07:45] How dare you?
she’s lying, i did no such thing
[07:49] show me
Oh my god, this man injured our child
[07:52] Just say the word, and
I’ll punch his nose off his face.
[07:56] Why should we take the law into
our own hands?
[07:59] We should just hand him over to the police,
they’ll teach him a proper lesson
[08:03] Ma’am please forgive me,
I swear i’ll never to do it again
[08:07] Here I’ll do however many sit-ups
you like but please forgive me
[08:12] Okay, I am letting you go this time,
[08:14] but from now on you’ll wait until
the kids are in the house.
[08:18] Do you understand?
[08:19] Why wait?” I’ll take them inside myself.
okay okay you can go now
[08:23] So it’s all good, right?
Yes, okay, let’s go.
[08:25] No wait, don’t start,
don’t leave without me
[08:29] hey kids, let’s go inside
let’s go
[08:33] Is there anything else
I can do for you?
[08:35] No, thank you for having my back.
[08:51] He threw him out of the moving van;
[08:53] what would I have done if my Tipu
had been seriously injured?
[08:57] this is exactly what happens to the kids
whose fathers stay in bed all day
[09:01] The driver must’ve thought,
“Who’s going to ask about him?”
[09:08] Ammaji, Sister Rania dealt
with him really well
[09:12] and also told him he won’t get
the following month’s fee
[09:16] You did the right thing.
Very good Rania, Very Good.
[09:22] I was wondering, Uncle,
[09:25] why don’t you take
the kids to the van?
[09:28] Since Uncle is home the entire day
and can pick up and drop off the kids,
[09:30] I think there is no need for a van.
[09:32] Everyone agrees that parents are the best
people to handle the children’s obligations,
[09:36] thus, Uncle will now pick up
and drop off the children.
[09:41] This wouldn’t be a problem if you were
that responsible in the first place.
[09:48] Come here, my son,
[09:50] it has been decided that
from this day forward,
[09:56] I shall drive my kids to
and from school.
[10:21] Greetings!
[10:27] Hello?
[10:32] Hello?
[10:34] there’s no need to peak
in every room,
[10:39] she hasn’t come back
[10:42] That woman has never shown me
any respect,
[10:47] she always brings up old stories to
embarrass me in front of the children,
[10:52] She refuses to acknowledge the fact
that the past is in the past
[10:57] and we are now much more
richer than them
[10:59] I don’t care what Aunt says,
[11:02] you went to bring her home yourself,
she should’ve respected you and came back
[11:08] I am going to call her now.
[11:12] Sure, get insulted,
I won’t stop you this time.
[11:21] How can she do this?
[11:32] Greetings!
[11:34] Hello, why didn’t you come back?
[11:36] Why are you speaking to me
in that tone?
[11:39] I mean, my respected father came
to bring you home himself,
[11:42] so why didn’t you come back?
[11:43] Ammaji asked me to stay
a few more days
[11:45] I am so sick of your Ammaji
[11:50] How dare you insult
my grandmother like that?
[11:53] no, no I did no such thing,
[11:56] I was only saying that
you should have come…
[11:58] Saman? Hello?
She cut the call?
[12:18] I’ll deal with you later
[12:39] Greetings sir!
[12:40] Your bike is in very good condition
[12:43] that’s my first love,
bought it in my college days
[12:47] and kept her safe ever since
hello!
[12:49] hello, hello.’
[12:52] Daddy, do you know
he’s our neighbour
[12:56] you cutie.
[12:58] it’s nice to meet you,
I have to take the kids to school
[13:02] we’ll talk in detail some other time
[13:03] Okay kids, get on the bike, come.
[13:06] Tipu, Mano you both forgot
your lunch again
[13:10] take it, be quick, let’s go
[13:13] Did you give it to them?
yes!
[13:18] Bye.
[13:23] Hi neighbour, how are you?
[13:26] What are you doing here
so early in the morning?
[13:28] You must be dropping your kids
off to school
[13:31] Do you think I look like someone
who has kids?
[13:35] I go to university, and look,
I have a bag too.
[13:39] Listen, where have you been?
[13:42] At home; where else would I be?
[13:43] I mean to say I don’t really
see you around much
[13:46] There’s nothing to do on the roads for me,
so I stay home.
[13:50] you are so witty, I am so impressed by you
[13:55] You should come over sometime,
I want to talk more about this humour of yours.
[13:59] Can I go?
[14:00] you didn’t say when
you will come to our house
[14:02] I think you should come to our house;
we are very hospitable people.
[14:06] I have a beautiful Mom,
A cute sister
[14:08] and there’s an uncle as well
[14:10] He’s neither beautiful nor cute;
he’s just kind of there.
[14:12] I will someday,
[14:14] but I can’t tell you when. Bye.
[14:20] so I’ll have to wait again
[14:28] I have to agree,
Rania is very persuasive.
[14:34] Hammad, who has never listened
to anyone his whole life,
[14:37] listened to her and agreed.
[14:42] He’s dropping the kids off
to school today
[14:44] My cousin is just like that, he’s a very
respected personality in his area
[14:50] I was thinking,
[14:52] Why don’t you get her an admission
in the same university as you?
[14:58] Grandma,
[15:00] I have a great reputation
at the university I am in
[15:02] and I would like to keep it that way
[15:05] What do you mean?
[15:06] What I mean is, what does
a respectable, clever,
[15:10] and pious girl like her have
to do with such a place?
[15:13] Get her admitted somewhere else.
[15:15] What you don’t know
about me is that
[15:18] I have secured first position in every class
since I was a little girl,
[15:21] and whichever university I choose,
would be honoured to have me.
[15:24] that’s exactly what I am saying
[15:26] My university and you are
on very different levels
[15:31] and it’s not like I have some personal rivalry
with an educational institution
[15:36] otherwise I would’ve gotten her in there
[15:39] your call, I can do it myself
[15:42] Ammaji, tell him not to bother. huh!
[15:45] Best of luck..
the dish, please.
[15:51] Grandma, sit; let’s eat.
[15:53] I have already eaten.
[16:07] stop trying to turn Ammaji against me,
[16:12] it’s not going to work
[16:24] Mona, why are you so stubborn,
[16:27] I told you to come as quick as possible
[16:29] and you’re still nowhere to be seen
[16:31] Tell me, when are you coming?
I am waiting.
[16:34] Keep attending your friends’ weddings
[16:37] because you’ll never get there
if you miss this chance
[16:42] You’re so confident as if Mahir has
already said yes to the wedding
[16:47] listen to me you idiot!
[16:49] There’s a new girl here,
clever as a fox
[16:53] She says she’s here
to continue her studies,
[16:56] but I am sure she was sent here
on some other mission.
[16:59] Do you understand?
[17:00] really?
[17:02] Who is she? What does she look like?
Tell me
[17:06] well in terms of looks she wins
by a long shot
[17:09] But how long will you keep getting
these updates from me,
[17:12] listen to me you need to get here
as soon as possible
[17:15] What will I do there?
[17:16] I came once before and Mahir
wasn’t very welcoming.
[17:21] He’s so rude
[17:23] listen to me,
forget about all that,
[17:26] we’ll achieve nothing if you lose
your strength now
[17:28] Just come!
[17:30] But listen to me!
[17:31] I don’t want to hear anything more
[17:33] Bye.
[17:45] Look how gorgeous I am,
[17:47] I wonder who’s there then
[17:50] I must go there now.
[17:52] why are you forcing her to come
if she doesn’t want to?
[17:59] Hammad, I only like you
when you are silent
[18:02] You never did anything in your life and
you’re holding me back as well
[18:05] I am just saying,
[18:07] she failed the last time she was here
and the same thing will happen again
[18:12] She's not Mahir’s type
[18:15] you are outwardly insulting
my sister now
[18:19] You sisters take offense in a second;
[18:23] what can a man do?
[18:25] A man like you won’t ever do anything
[18:28] You will just stay in this bed forever
[18:30] Do you think I am doing this for Mona?
[18:34] No, I am doing this for us,
our children and our future
[18:38] I understand, I completely understand
[18:43] Don’t you dare try to wreck my plans.
[18:46] I am warning you.
[18:52] you are right,
[18:53] but listen flower,
listen to me dear
[18:59] If the families aren’t supportive
of the relationship
[19:02] then the couple has to put
in a little more effort.
[19:06] You must go through these hardships
to prove your love,
[19:10] make some drama
[19:12] The thing is,
[19:14] the guy’s parents aren’t willing to meet
with the girl’s family, right?
[19:21] Hmm...
[19:23] you see it’s not crucial
for the Girl’s family
[19:27] to introduce themselves as her parents
to the man’s parents
[19:31] They can just go over to their house
[19:35] and say something like, Um..
[19:38] Like,
[19:40] “We are looking for a house in this area;
[19:44] do you people have a house in mind?”
[19:47] Then a conversation will start
[19:50] which will lead to acquaintance,
[19:53] then friendship
[19:55] and and after that there will be
no need to send a proposal,
[19:58] everything will work out on its own
[20:00] Do you like my idea?
[20:02] Who knew Mr. Maheer here would turn out
to be such a filmy person
[20:07] and in love even though he acts so rude?
[20:13] What a betrayal!
[20:15] What a betrayal to Ammaji!
[20:18] It seems as though the Girl’s parents will be
coming here soon enough.
[20:23] Sister,
[20:24] I have sauteed the onion now.
[20:26] What should I add next?
Tomatoes or yogurt?
[20:29] What a disaster has happened,
[20:31] and you’re here worried
about tomatoes and yogurt?
[20:32] Add them both and go away
And don’t come back,
[20:35] I have some thinking to do
[20:36] But how much yogurt and
how many tomatoes?
[20:38] ugh!
[20:39] I don’t know go ask aunt,
[20:42] I am a also a kid myself I don’t know
about these things
[20:44] Auntie can’t even cook an egg, and here
you are talking about meatballs.
[20:48] Neither do I, but I have a recipe
[20:52] Wait, I’ll give it to you
but you need to go right now.
[20:56] It needs more salt
Go away!
[20:58] I am going.
[21:02] Mahir sahab
[21:04] who lives with such entitlement,
[21:07] how would he feel
if rain all over his parade.
[21:12] What if I treat the ones
who are coming in such a way
[21:16] that they never even think
of coming back’
[21:24] Haha.
[21:26] Did you see that?
Yes, I did. Look now.
[21:31] okay
[21:32] Look at these useless people
watching cartoon at this age]
[21:36] Uncle put this show on
I just came here
[21:40] For god’s sake,
[21:41] I know I have a thin neck but that doesn’t
mean you can always present me for slaughter
[21:45] Stop arguing and tell me why you haven’t
done the chores around the house before my arrival.
[21:49] Why should I do this and
go to the office as well?
[21:54] You are absolutely right. Mama,
[21:58] have you seen the girls next door?
[22:00] They’re so well-mannered
and respectful
[22:02] What do you mean?
Have you met those girls?
[22:05] Yeah, I mean, no.
[22:07] they’re our neighbours so I heard
that about them from here
[22:09] Okay, when you came to the neighbourhood,
you started making friends?
[22:12] Hey, I am giving you the last warning.
[22:15] Just focus on your studies.
[22:17] I don't want dumb people in this house.
[22:19] Maybe you are pointing towards me?
[22:22] Not maybe, I am definitely
pointing towards you.
[22:24] Laiba? Come to the kitchen.
Knead the dough and do the dishes.
[22:27] I am coming, mother.
[22:28] What is it? I am available
for free for them.
[22:31] I am supposed to do the house chores,
as well as go to the office, do this, do that.
[22:36] Why does sister abuse me
like this all the time?
[22:39] What am I?
[22:42] Be patient, uncle. Be patient.
[22:45] Because those who are patient
are being rewarded great.
[22:49] I thought when there will be a decision
about father's property,
[22:51] then when I will get my share,
I will plan a trip after selling that.
[22:55] Visit Thailand and Russia.
[22:57] And maybe get married
to some white woman
[23:00] I had even selected
the travel packages
[23:02] But our uncle is sitting on that
land like a poisonous snake,
[23:06] he’s not even giving me
that little fruit garden
[23:11] Where do I go?
[23:12] All my dreams have died,
[23:14] and no one even cares
about getting me married.
[23:19] should I bring you some water?
[23:21] go drown in it instead.
[23:27] Let the girl’s family come.
[23:29] They will run away.
[23:31] They will never get ready to have
the wedding fixed here.
[23:35] Maheer thinks he is something
out of this world.
[23:39] I will reverse all his efforts.
[23:44] I will enjoy a lot.
[23:48] Sister, Rabia.
[23:49] Grandmother was calling you
to press her clothes.
[23:53] Rania?
Come here fast.
[23:55] What happened?
Come here.
[23:57] Did you close that? Yes.
If you remember 38’s, do tell me.
[23:59] Will you teach maths
to the children?
[24:00] Grandmother has called me
to press her clothes.
[24:02] Maths? I can easily do it.
Give it to me.
[24:04] Here you go.
[24:05] I will be right back after ironing
grandmother’s clothes.
[24:06] Here, take this pencil, fast.
Rabi? Yes?
[24:08] What are you doing?
[24:09] What?
[24:10] Are you mad?
[24:11] Are you even concerned about
the children’s future or not?
[24:13] Hey, our children are the students
of the model school of O’levels.
[24:16] And this madam?
[24:18] She has graduated from a small
government school in her village.
[24:21] If she will teach our children,
[24:22] not only our money would go
in waste,
[24:24] future of these children
will be ruined too.
[24:26] Oh, yes! In our old school,
five plus five was not ten, rather eleven.
[24:31] Hey, we don’t study maths
in English or Urdu.
[24:34] We study in another planet’s language.
Right?
[24:38] Then you come and teach them.
Come on.
[24:40] Hey, don’t need to mind it.
[24:42] They are such intelligent children.
[24:44] And I don’t want that
because of you,
[24:46] future of these children gets ruined.
[24:48] Why would I mind it?
It is my good luck,
[24:51] that I am in the company of
intelligent people like you.
[24:55] I am learning a lot, right?
[24:56] For example,
[24:57] considering yourself out of this world
in front of others.
[25:00] And how to talk by making faces
and throwing tantrums, right?
[25:04] And how to degrade others
while talking.
[25:06] And I have learned
so many other things too.
[25:08] But now I can’t mention them all,
right?
[25:11] Right? You are just…
Children?
[25:12] If you don’t get full marks
in the test tomorrow,
[25:15] then you may change my name.
[25:16] Aristotle’s uncle!
[25:21] You guys are laughing, yes?
[25:22] Now you ask chocolates.
[25:25] Concentrate on your studies.
[25:26] And, you too?
[25:28] I am going to iron grandmother’s clothes.
I have not done anything.
[25:31] Come, show me your copy.
What are you doing?
[25:34] Such bad homework?
[25:36] What kind of handwriting is this?
[25:37] I feel like tearing the copy apart.
[25:39] Oh God! I am amazed.
[25:42] How do people show attitude
on this quality of education?
[25:45] Come here to me, fast.
[25:49] Now do as I teach you.
Get it?
[25:52] Look here.
You will add first.
[25:54] Mano?
Then you will multiply.
[25:55] If you need to ask anything,
ask your brother Maheer.
[25:58] Mano?
Show me your book.
[26:00] Show it to me.
Let me see what you are doing.
[26:03] Oh God! I repent. God,
all the situation is same.
[26:07] Go bring the eraser.
You will have to do it all over again.
[26:10] Thankfully, I saw it.
[26:14] Erase it all.
We will write it again.
[26:17] Okay?
Erase it now.
[26:20] The answer is…
[26:25] Okay this one.
Grandmother?
[26:27] What is happening?
[26:29] I was downloading this beauty app.
[26:32] But it’s not downloading.
Come show me, I will do it.
[26:35] It’s easy.
[26:36] You know the old one, right?
Yes, this one.
[26:39] See this. You need to go here.
Yes.
[26:41] Open this. Click this.
[26:43] And the downloading starts.
[26:47] Grandmother?
Yes?
[26:49] I have such a big news for you.
[26:51] Yes?
[26:52] Your grandson…
Mr. Maheer…
[26:55] Oh, child.
[26:56] When he was a baby,
[26:58] his mother passed away.
[27:02] And his father went abroad.
[27:06] And he got married again
after going there.
[27:09] Exactly.
[27:11] So that’s why my son was left alone.
[27:17] And as much as he laughs and smiles,
[27:20] in reality, he is totally sad.
[27:25] He just keeps what’s in his heart,
to his heart.
[27:28] He doesn’t share it with anyone.
[27:30] Boys his age do fun
and gossip around.
[27:36] And he has taken all responsibility
on his head.
[27:43] And the responsibility has
made him serious.
[27:46] Oh my God!
[27:47] Did anyone ask him for tea or not?
[27:51] He must be sitting without having tea.
[27:53] Oh God!
[27:55] Thankfully, everything is clear.
[27:58] Otherwise, I would have done
so wrong.
[28:01] I misjudged this poor thing.
[28:07] Poor thing’s mother passed away.
[28:09] And father?
[28:11] He got married after going abroad.
[28:13] He forgot about his living son,
and left him alone,
[28:18] to face the world alone.
[28:22] That is why…
[28:24] That is why he made Ifrah his life.
[28:28] But that is also my promise.
[28:32] I will make Ifrah and
Maheer united.
[28:35] From today onwards, in this house…
Rather no.
[28:38] In this whole world, I am the biggest
supporter of Maheer.
[28:44] I will support that great person.
[28:47] I will never mind anything that
depressed person would say.
[28:51] Grandmother?
[28:52] You just say. I will give tea
to Maheer myself.
[28:54] Just wait.
Look, Ifrah.
[28:57] You will have to do a little effort, right?
[28:59] You will have to do some efforts
in such cases.
[29:03] Hey, I am with you.
[29:04] Nothing will happen.
[29:06] Yes, but you will have to be
a little courageous.
[29:09] Yes, then what else? Now you will
have to be a little courageous. Right?
[29:12] What are you doing here?
[29:13] I have brought tea for you.
[29:17] I will talk to you later on.
[29:18] Hey, why?
[29:20] You can talk in front of me
without hesitating.
[29:22] Consider me your friend.
[29:25] Share your problems with me.
[29:26] I will solve them in minutes.
[29:28] I am such an expert
in solving problems.
[29:30] I will give you such a nice suggestion…
[29:32] I don’t need any suggestion of yours.
[29:34] Thank you.
[29:36] Hey, what did you just say?
[29:38] Knowledge and wisdom are not
lessened if shared.
[29:41] They are rather increased.
[29:43] I am seeing the actions
of your wisdom.
[29:46] Bananas with the tea?
[29:48] Nice combination.
[29:50] Now see,
you don’t take care of yourself.
[29:52] You burn your blood by drinking tea.
[29:55] You are always tangled.
[29:57] There are deep thoughts in your eyes.
[30:00] Blankness on your face.
[30:03] There is something else on your mind,
and something else at your tongue.
[30:06] That is why I have brought
bananas for you.
[30:09] Okay, so if I will have these bananas
dipped in the tea,
[30:14] that will cure all my diseases?
[30:16] Oh?
[30:17] So, how many times in a day
should I take this dose?
[30:19] No.
[30:20] You don’t have to have bananas
with the tea.
[30:22] I have brought biscuits with the tea.
[30:24] You can eat bananas
anytime in the day.
[30:26] Thankfully!
[30:27] By the way, you are so lucky.
[30:31] Now see, I have decided
to be friends with you. Yes?
[30:35] [thinks]
Oh Allah!
[30:36] I am not such a sinner. Please
don’t give me such a punishment.
[30:42] What are you thinking?
[30:44] You don’t worry.
From today onwards,
[30:47] all your problems are mine.
[30:50] Hmm.
[30:51] Can I have my tea now?
[30:52] Yes, yes. You can have it.
[30:54] I like to have my tea alone.
[30:58] Okay. So I should go?
[31:03] By the way, I don’t mind
anything you say now.
[31:08] Okay then I will leave now.
[31:09] Enjoy your tea.
[31:16] Who is she to give
suggestions to me now?
[31:25] When you are done cleaning the vase,
then give me a cup of tea.
[31:28] I am busy.
[31:31] Come on, child, Rania.
Where are you busy?
[31:35] I am so busy right now.
[31:37] I need your bike keys.
[31:39] Why?
Why the keys?
[31:41] Rabel wants to go to the market.
[31:42] I said I will drop you.
[31:44] You know how to ride a bike?
[31:46] You know how to ride a bike too?
[31:49] Yes, totally.
You can have race with me.
[31:52] Then I will tell you.
[31:53] And now Maheer is even teaching me
to drive a car.
[31:56] Well, give me your keys.
[31:59] Here you go, child.
Drive carefully.
[32:00] You don’t worry. I am not riding it
for the first time.
[32:04] Right? Thank you.
[32:06] What a girl she is.
[32:08] And you gave her the keys so easily.
[32:10] There is a limit.
She is such a cute girl.
[32:12] Maheer is teaching her how to drive a car.
That means they are friends now.
[32:15] Give me your mobile.
[32:17] Give me the mobile.
[32:26] Hello Moanna?
[32:27] Do you know…?
[32:29] Hmm.
[32:35] Sister Rania,
you can ride a bike too?
[32:39] Hey, I can even fly a plane.
[32:41] That’s another thing that there is no guarantee
that whether it will return or not.
[32:44] Will you teach me?
To fly a plane?
[32:47] No, to ride a bike.
[32:48] Oh, so you want to learn
how to ride a bike?
[32:51] I will teach you.
You see.
[32:52] It is so easy.
[32:54] Here goes your key.
[32:59] There you go with the kick.
[33:08] Oh, hero?
Where are you going?
[33:10] Are you alone or your father
has come too?
[33:13] No, no.
I have come alone.
[33:15] I came to say hello
to the sister-in-law.
[33:17] Okay, okay. Then go.
Who has stopped you?
[33:20] Yes.
Rania?
[33:23] Shall we go?
[33:24] Hey? When did you come?
[33:26] I have just come.
[33:27] For what did you come?
[33:29] I wanted to meet the sister-in-law.
[33:30] Okay, okay.
[33:31] Now do you want to interview him
or shall we go?
[33:33] Hey, Rania.
We will go in a while.
[33:35] He is a guest. Besides,
no one pays respect to him.
[33:38] Atleast let me ask him tea
or something.
[33:39] Let’s go.
Okay.
[33:41] If that’s the thing, then let’s go.
[33:43] Come on.
[33:45] Actually, brother was missing
sister-in-law so much.
[33:48] Poor thing is sad.
[33:50] Really?
Then didn’t he come himself?
[33:52] He doesn’t like your grandmother,
that is why.
[33:54] Hey?
[33:55] You are saying bad things about
our grandmother in front of us?
[33:57] Are you not ashamed?
[33:59] No, sorry.
[34:00] The truth slipped out of my mouth.
[34:02] Be careful and sensible.
[34:04] She just got angry over something wrong.
Otherwise, she has such a nice heart.
[34:07] Yes, our father praises her
morality a lot.
[34:11] He doesn’t go tired.
[34:13] Sorry.
[34:14] Let’s go.
[34:16] It’s your house. You come.
[34:23] Boy is not that innocent,
[34:25] as much as I thought he was.
[34:28] I told you I didn’t want
to come back now.
[34:31] I want to stay at grandmother’s house
for a few days.
[34:32] Why don’t you understand what I say?
[34:35] And now I am even offended with him.
[34:37] The other day, he sent such wrong things
to me over phone call.
[34:39] What?
[34:40] When did this happen?
[34:41] You didn’t tell me?
[34:43] I would have scolded both the son
and his father,
[34:46] that they would remember
all their lives.
[34:50] Anyway, I didn’t do that.
[34:52] But now this boy is in my cage.
[34:55] No, grandmother.
[34:57] I am also tired of those
father and son.
[34:59] They abuse me too.
Consider me against them.
[35:04] I am not with them at all.
[35:05] Don’t give me the punishment
for what they have done, please.
[35:08] They got the money but
they didn’t learn the humanity.
[35:11] Okay, mother. I will leave now.
Sit down.
[35:14] Don’t you dare go back
without having tea.
[35:16] Good families do not send guests back
without serving them anything.
[35:22] Go say this to your father
after going back,
[35:24] as long as he doesn’t come back here
and say sorry for all his ill doings,
[35:29] till then,
I will not send Saman back.
[35:32] But grandmother,
[35:33] how will brother Arbab live without
sister Saman for this many days?
[35:37] You shut up. What do you know?
[35:39] You just interfere.
[35:41] Go make tea.
[35:43] Go.
[35:45] Just look at her!
[35:48] There she goes!
[36:02] [thinks]
Mother, take care of my bike.
[36:08] Child, Asia?
[36:10] Yes, uncle?
Did you need anything?
[36:11] No, I didn’t want anything.
[36:13] I am seeing you.
What happened to you?
[36:16] Yes? You are silent. What do you
keep on thinking about?
[36:19] Nothing, uncle.
[36:21] My heart is sad since Rani left.
[36:24] There is nothing else.
[36:26] Hey, let her come back. She has just
left a couple of days ago.
[36:30] […] Right?
[36:33] If you say, I will ask her
to come back.
[36:37] No, uncle.
[36:39] Don’t call her back.
[36:41] Rani child has to study a lot.
[36:44] She has to become a big officer in the city.
Hmm.
[36:46] When she will be done studying,
and will become a big officer,
[36:50] uncle, this stain will be
washed away too,
[36:53] that her father is alive
[36:54] but doesn’t want to meet his daughter.
[36:56] Then people will come to ask for
Rani’s hand-in-marriage from far away.
[37:01] Then nobody will question this,
[37:03] what did her mother lack?
[37:05] That her father left her and
didn’t even ask about her?
[37:08] If I would be alive, I will tell them.
[37:11] You didn’t lack anything.
[37:13] That ill-fated person was as such.
[37:15] He considered all that glitter as gold.
[37:18] Her daughter was born,
[37:20] that ill-fated person didn’t even
come back for her.
[37:23] Rania,
will make our dreams come true.
[37:33] I just think about Rania only.
[37:38] And Farah?
[37:41] What is she doing this early
in the morning?
[38:28] Hello?
[38:30] Thank God, dude.
You called.
[38:31] I was waiting for your call.
[38:33] Now tell me.
Did things proceed further?
[38:36] Yes, yes?
[38:37] Really? Then?
[38:42] Oho.
[38:44] Hmm.
[38:45] No, no. Listen, listen.
[38:46] Don’t worry about me.
[38:49] What are you doing, dude?
[38:50] You tore my head off.
[38:52] I am being dizzy.
What were you doing here?
[38:55] Yes?
What were you doing here?
[38:57] I can’t recall
what I was here to do?
[38:59] Wow.
[39:01] Why am I seeing everything blurry?
[39:03] Seems like I am blind.
Oh God!
[39:06] What is happening here?
[39:07] We are fighting.
[39:09] You can join too.
Then it’s fine.
[39:10] I thought, may God forbid,
there is a friendly atmosphere here.
[39:14] Carry on fighting.
[39:18] Why did you disconnect the call?
Whose call was it by the way?
[39:21] It was my friend Farid’s call
[39:23] Do you want to talk?
Shall I? Yes?
[39:24] No, no.
Why would I talk to him?
[39:27] You just stay away from me.
[39:30] To hell with this Farid.
[39:33] She said it would be Ifrah’s call,
they must be planning.
