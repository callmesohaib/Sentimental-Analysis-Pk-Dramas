[00:17] Listen, it's good that I found you here,
[00:20] can you drop me at Saman's house?
[00:21] Khawar and I are going for shopping.
[00:24] If you are going with Khawar
[00:25] ask him to pick up and drop you.
[00:27] Why would I do that?
Do I run a cab service?
[00:29] Oh, calm down,
why are you getting so angry?
[00:33] You won’t be wasted if you drop me,
you're sitting idle
[00:37] and Khawar is always busy with his work,
his business.
[00:42] What keeps him busy?
Which office are you talking about?
[00:45] He just stays there,
[00:47] brother Arbab and uncle Rafique
do all the work.
[00:49] And even if he is busy,
what do I do about it,
[00:52] am I an employee?
If you really want to go,
[00:55] get a cab and leave.
[00:58] Hey, behave yourself,
do you know who I am?
[01:01] The only future wife of a business man.
[01:06] And I? Travel in a taxi?
[01:10] Never.
Mona,
[01:13] Mona.
[01:14] I've heard Khawar has invited you
to shop and dinner?
[01:19] It's true.
[01:20] But he isn't dropping me there
and I'm getting late.
[01:23] Let him go and listen to me,
[01:26] I was the one who did all the hard work
to make this relationship possible.
[01:29] And both you and Khawar
excluded me so conveniently.
[01:35] So that's why I have decided,
you won't be going alone today,
[01:38] I will go with you for shopping and
then we'll have dinner together.
[01:42] I'd say Mahir,
you should join us as well,
[01:44] especially since sister-in-law Sweetie
has disregarded you so much,
[01:48] it's okay that you can't
afford expensive shoes,
[01:52] phone, and clothes anymore.
[01:54] It's all about time,
how we used to long for things,
[01:57] but it's okay, come, join us.
We're getting late.
[02:00] I'll don’t care about money.
[02:03] And I'm not in such bad times
that I'll have to enjoy his money.
[02:06] Okay, you stay at home,
and damn it,
[02:09] we're getting late,
come on Mona.
[02:10] Us? Not us, only me.
[02:14] I, alone would be going for shopping and
dinner because he invited me only, not you.
[02:18] Also it's your turn to
wash the dishes today,
[02:20] and anyway if you aren't dropping me
then I can take lifts as well,
[02:25] okay bye.
[02:28] I could have asked Hammad.
[02:37] How she's taunting me,
father's wife,
[02:40] I have to do something for her.
[02:42] I have to include Rania as well,
[02:44] I'll tolerate her bitterness as well
[02:47] but I can't tolerate
this madam Sweetie.
[02:50] Only Rania can fight her
because poison kills poison.
[03:05] It is a big mistake,
[03:07] if I were in place of his daughter,
[03:11] would I be able to forgive
such a father?
[03:14] Yes, I might have forgiven him.
[03:18] I would have forgotten everything
if I had my father in front of me,
[03:23] and would run to hug him.
[03:26] I should meet his daughter
and other family members,
[03:31] I understand that
his fault is major
[03:34] but I'll talk to them about him.
[03:51] You are sitting here alone?
[03:53] All good?
[03:55] It feels nice.
[04:00] Well, my father's second wife,
isn't she weird?
[04:06] What do you mean?
[04:08] Don't you think she's weird?
[04:10] She changed suddenly,
[04:13] she says she can see her mother
in our grandmother.
[04:18] Can you believe it?
[04:23] Rania, I think she's planning
for something big.
[04:26] I don't know where do
uncle's family live.
[04:32] And did you see?
[04:34] She made grandmother her fan,
[04:36] grandmother was talking strangely
at the dinner table.
[04:39] I think she's planning a big game,
[04:44] right?
[04:47] I am thinking
I should consult aunt.
[04:51] Why, what is the need
to consult aunt?
[04:54] Everything is very obviously visible.
[04:57] Who?
[04:58] What are you talking about?
[05:01] I said something,
did you hear anything?
[05:04] Where are you lost?
[05:06] I'm thinking about Dr. Wasiq...
Dr. Wasiq.
[05:12] Now I understand,
[05:14] that's why you are here,
alone at night,
[05:19] lost in your thoughts.
[05:22] He might have said something.
[05:24] What did he say?
I should also know.
[05:28] Not everything is to share.
[05:31] Also,
[05:33] I think you won't understand
the depth of this matter.
[05:39] You're right,
[05:42] only you or a qualified doctor like Dr. Wasiq
can understand the depth of this situation.
[05:49] I might drown if I try to understand it.
[05:53] It's something like this.
[05:57] Okay, I'm sorry, it was my fault,
[06:01] I thought you're alone so I should
give her some company,
[06:07] sorry.
[06:09] Stay alone.
[06:16] If I didn't know your reality,
I would have fallen into your traps.
[06:22] Why did you want to give me company,
I know it all too well.
[06:30] Wasiq, Wasiq, Wasiq,
she's only saying his name.
[06:34] If I could I would remove the name of
Dr. Wasiq from her heart and her mind forever.
[06:40] Mahir, she's an independent citizen
of an independent country,
[06:43] you can't restrict her.
[06:44] I was the one who got you into
a relationship with Ifrah,
[06:47] and how I think
I shouldn't have done that.
[06:49] Rania played the main role
in that as well.
[06:52] Whose friend are you? Mine or...
Hey, Rania, come here,
[06:56] I have to scold you.
Salik.
[06:59] Don't say something stupid,
she'll overreact.
[07:01] How are you?
How is life?
[07:04] What do I tell you,
life is very sad.
[07:07] Who made my brother sad?
Must be Ifrah's family.
[07:13] The issues of everyone around
the world matters to her but mine?
[07:16] She takes it as a joke.
Can you see that?
[07:20] Which problem?
[07:23] That American mother issue?
[07:26] I believe she's sent
to break your arrogance,
[07:31] it's a role of nature,
you shall reap what you sow.
[07:37] Did you see Salik?
[07:38] She has such a negative
approach regarding me.
[07:41] Rania, don't play with his soft
and delicate emotions.
[07:45] Soft and delicate emotions?
And his?
[07:48] May God forgive us.
[07:50] Yes, that Dr. Wasiq has soft and
delicate emotions, not me.
[07:55] Again Dr. Wasiq?
[07:56] If your evil stepmother is being
cruel to you
[08:00] so what does Dr. Wasiq
have to do with this?
[08:02] Neither did Dr. Wasiq call his mother here
nor he's paying her to be cruel to him.
[08:07] I don't know why you're after him.
[08:10] And listen,
[08:11] whatever she's doing
it’s her own ideas.
[08:18] Okay now don't make a sad face,
[08:20] I'll help you for God's sake.
[08:22] Rania please, it'll be a favor.
[08:25] He's buying a bike.
[08:27] Bike? What do you mean?
[08:29] Where is that, Hayabusa?
[08:32] That bike?
[08:33] Our hero gifted it to Mr. Malik
at his wedding long ago.
[08:37] What?
[08:39] Just for show-off?
[08:43] Make fun of me,
as much as you want,
[08:47] that's exactly what happens at the end,
she makes fun of all my issues.
[08:51] Okay, I won't make fun.
[08:53] Let's do one thing, Pickup, my scooty,
it's parked in Khushalpur,
[08:58] import it and ride it for a while.
You'll remember it.
[09:03] What? That scooty?
I'll ride?
[09:07] And anyway I don't take
financial help from girls.
[09:11] This, this is his narrow mindset.
[09:13] Now ask me for help.
[09:15] It's very good, whatever is happening
to you it’s well deserved.
[09:17] I'll ask you when a woman will be
the prime minister of this country.
[09:21] Which woman? We can't see a strong,
political woman currently.
[09:24] I'm talking about the future
Mr. Salik, future.
[09:27] Me, Rania Ahmed,
future prime minister.
[09:40] Well Salik, that's an advantage
of talking to her,
[09:47] come let's chant.
[09:48] Prime minister, Rania Ahmed.
[09:51] Long live, prime minister.
[09:53] Long live, prime minister.
I want to slap them.
[09:56] Don't discuss your big dreams
in front of narrow-minded people.
[10:00] How do we our leader to be?
Like Rania Ahmed.
[10:03] It's a compulsion, Rania Ahmed is needed.
Say it loud, Rania Ahmed.
[10:06] Shout it, Rania Ahmed.
Say it slow, Rania Ahmed.
[10:09] Say it loud, Rania Ahmed.
What are you doing?
[10:12] Now say what?
[10:44] I'm thinking to take Rabail
to a jeweller in a few days,
[10:47] to get the jewellery of her choice.
[10:49] You're thinking right,
[10:50] I'll also meet her this way,
I mean I can give suggestions.
[10:54] I'm getting your tricks, come,
you'll remember.
[11:00] Well mother, it's just about suggestions,
[11:02] I can give it too,
I can come along.
[11:05] Hey, hey, hey, what kind of sister
you are, my enemy.
[11:08] You have exams go and study.
[11:12] I wish my fate was like that too,
[11:15] I too, could take someone
to buy her jewelry.
[11:20] But I'm unlucky,
[11:23] moonlight for 4 days then
the same dark night.
[11:30] Look at the jewelry.
[11:42] Uncle? Why are you sitting here?
[11:45] I'm getting vitamin D
in this scorching heat.
[11:49] You look sad.
[11:51] I'd be sad.
[11:52] Everyone is setting
my dreams on fire.
[11:57] 4 years younger, 3 ¾ years
younger nephew is getting married.
[12:01] They're doing preparations.
Tents are being arranged.
[12:05] And I, am I going
to babysit his child?
[12:09] Am I going to play with his children
and change their diapers?
[12:12] What am I going to do?
[12:14] My that, what do we call that?
[12:16] Headdress, headdress, headdress.
When will the flowers for my headdress bloom?
[12:18] When will the flowers bloom?
[12:19] When will they carry my palanquin?
[12:22] What? Palanquin is carried for girls,
boys take the barat.
[12:27] Barat?
Yes.
[12:29] Then when will my barat go?
[12:31] And from where?
[12:32] When will I get ready,
wearing a groom's headdress?
[12:34] When will they do the videography
for my wedding?
[12:36] When will they hide my shoes
or give me milk as a custom?
[12:39] When will I wear a headdress
and take a, what is it?
[12:42] Handkerchief like this?
[12:44] When will the girls dance
at my ceremonies?
[12:47] When? When will
all this happen? When?
[12:50] Well it's saddening,
[12:53] such a big social worker lives
next door, runs after you.
[12:57] And you're getting so hopeless?
[13:00] Now give,
give me your phone.
[13:02] Phone?
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[13:03] Phone.
[13:05] I'm giving you aunt's contact number.
Aunt's contact is.
[13:09] It is already saved,
[13:11] then you should call,
[13:13] you spend a good time,
you will be occupied.
[13:17] I could call on
[13:19] but I am afraid what if
your grandfather answers the call,
[13:22] I heard he's in contact with
village's goons.
[13:24] He's running a proper network,
what if they break my legs.
[13:27] Oh, no, no, nothing like this
is going to happen,
[13:29] instead it's a good thing
it will make your way.
[13:33] And stop being coward,
be a lion, lion.
[13:36] Call her, just like that,
[13:38] let me get scotch tape from the house,
I have to wrap Tipu's book.
[13:42] You be a lion.
Lion.
[13:51] How many times I have told these ill-mannered
children to not play in front of the house,
[13:55] they don't understand,
[13:57] I will tell them now, today
I will break their legs.
[14:04] This son of a Romeo
is calling again.
[14:07] How many times have I told him
that I do not want to marry him.
[14:11] He doesn't understand,
I'll correct his brain now.
[14:14] How dare you call me,
[14:16] I told you won't marry you,
[14:19] is there grass in your head
instead of a brain?
[14:22] That you don't understand it?
[14:23] Ill-mannered,
fraud, boomer.
[14:25] What do you mean?
[14:28] That day you answered
with a smile,
[14:31] so what do I think of it?
[14:35] Who?
[14:37] Are you Ayaz?
[14:40] Yes, yes,
I'm that ill-mannered,
[14:43] misbehaving,
and a little overage Ayaz.
[14:46] I am sorry,
[14:48] I didn't mean to say all that to you.
[14:51] A crazy person here is after me,
he's annoying me I thought it was his call.
[14:56] Very sorry, very sorry.
[14:58] Okay leave this, tell me,
how are you?
[15:01] I'm awake,
I mean I came alive Asma,
[15:06] your sweet words gave life
to this dead.
[15:09] Oh God, you talk so sweet.
[15:13] Really?
Really.
[15:18] Asma,
[15:21] Asma.
[15:31] The places we leave behind in the
journey of life, don't come back again.
[15:35] Don't come back again.
[15:37] Asma when you laugh,
it feels like spring is taking over.
[15:42] Here you go,
[15:43] an additional of a good deed
in my list of actions.
[15:47] I connected two hearts,
[15:50] well both of them were close
to their expiry date, well saved.
[15:53] Thank you, God.
[15:57] It feels like a storm.
[16:11] You seem so happy,
where are you coming from?
[16:14] Where are you coming from?
Where are you going?
[16:16] Even my grandfather did not ask
so many questions.
[16:20] I wish he did, would've saved us.
[16:23] I am not in the mood to argue
[16:25] because I am actually very happy,
[16:27] do you know I almost finalized the
relationship between Uncle Ayaz and Bebo.
[16:32] What?
[16:33] You already fixed the relationship
between uncle Ayaz and Bebo?
[16:36] Yes, what's so surprising in it?
[16:39] The world accepts my wisdom.
[16:42] Both liked each other
[16:44] I got the hint and then what,
the love story started.
[16:48] I think along with Rabail,
my aunt will also be getting married,
[16:52] do your preparations and
don't say I didn't tell.
[17:00] She recognizes everyone's love
but mine,
[17:04] can't you see that?
[17:06] Very strange wisdom you have.
[17:10] Well-done Mr. Mahir,
[17:12] you had to stick
to this crazy woman?
[17:16] What can we do?
Now that we're stuck,
[17:18] we have to make a sacrifice.
[17:21] 26, 26, hey my game. Hey.
Here, give me your thumbprint.
[17:25] Game. You dare take this phone
from me again.
[17:29] Hey listen to me,
listen to me,
[17:31] don't suspect me, I know
that I'm really beautiful
[17:34] but that doesn't mean,
you will stay in your suspensions.
[17:38] Listen to me,
[17:39] it's about 15-20 years old occurrence
when you use to look good.
[17:43] When you get time from
playing the game
[17:44] then look in the mirror for once,
you'll be scared.
[17:47] You know I am very sensitive,
[17:50] think before you say anything to me
that my heart can break.
[17:55] Hammad, I'll listen to your
emotional stories later,
[17:58] I'm very surprised,
not even surprised I'm worried.
[18:02] Really? Tell me,
what happened?
[18:04] Your sister-in-law.
[18:05] What happened?
[18:06] She's not a human.
[18:08] What are you saying?
[18:09] She's a riddle,
which I'm unable to solve.
[18:12] She impressed mother-in-law,
she was admiring her.
[18:15] Well you are right.
[18:19] As soon as we get out of here,
it's better for us.
[18:22] Hand me the phone.
[18:24] Hello, hello,
hello, hello.
[18:28] I'm really tired by going everywhere.
[18:32] Khawar took me to so many places,
so many places, that I can't tell.
[18:35] Then don't tell, who is asking?
Can't you see
[18:38] a husband and a wife are having
an important discussion?
[18:40] And listen to me, the way
you are roaming around with Khawar,
[18:43] and shopping and dining, stop this,
it's not a part of our culture.
[18:46] Really?
[18:48] So now the elder sisters getting jealous
of her younger sister.
[18:51] And why do I stop all this?
Did you forget your time,
[18:55] where was it in your culture,
[18:57] when you used to roam around with
brother Hammad on his bike secretly.
[18:59] Now that the younger sister is going out
in a bigger car you are getting jealous.
[19:04] Oh I'll die, Hammad did you see,
I got a taunt on your bike.
[19:08] And listen to me,
your "Khawar weds Mona"?
[19:12] I made this relationship happen,
if you misbehave with me like this
[19:14] then I'll stop it.
[19:16] Really? If that is what it is like,
[19:18] then try it and if you succeed,
change my name.
[19:24] Brother Hammad, Khawar is lovely,
and you know?
[19:28] He's already miserable after me,
miserable.
[19:31] My child, not miserable,
[19:33] he's mad, he's crazy after you.
[19:37] No it's not like that,
[19:38] he really loves me
[19:40] and do you know what he was saying?
He said Mona darling,
[19:42] you're really beautiful
and modern,
[19:45] and there is no one as innocent
and naive as you.
[19:48] Innocent and naive our Mona.
[19:53] I think I am really tired
[19:54] and I also have to put these away,
okay bye.
[19:58] Well what was I saying?
[20:00] You were saying today onwards,
[20:03] you will never repeat the mistakes
of your past,
[20:06] you will respect me and
you won't snatch my phone for me.
[20:11] When did I say that?
[20:17] I will cut off your thumb
if you annoy me.
[20:20] Here.
[20:23] Thank you.
[20:34] I became a maid here,
[20:37] what are you asking me to do?
[20:43] I have to include at least someone
in this act of mine.
[20:51] Seema?
[20:53] No, she's very.
[21:00] Mona?
[21:14] Madam Sweetie, for you,
[21:16] Shehenshah's special strong tea
with extra sugar.
[21:54] Shehenshah, you can go now,
[21:56] when I am done
with making the breakfast
[21:58] then you can come to set the table.
Okay, go now.
[22:02] Okay.
[22:16] What are you doing early
in the morning?
[22:19] Oh, today was my day off
from the university
[22:21] so I thought I should make
breakfast for everyone.
[22:23] Okay listen, how long have
you been here?
[22:26] A few months have passed,
[22:28] actually I got admission
at a university here.
[22:32] And for how long are you
planning to stay?
[22:35] Actually it isn't appropriate to live
at someone else's house,
[22:39] no matter how close they are.
[22:41] I've heard you don't have a father,
[22:44] who pays your fees?
[22:47] My fees?
[22:50] The neighbors collect
donations to pay it,
[22:54] but don't worry
I won't ask you.
[22:58] If you have another question
then ask away,
[23:00] I have proper answers
to every question.
[23:13] Mother, I've set the breakfast,
I've told everyone about the breakfast,
[23:18] now I'm going to clean up.
[23:19] Okay, but first of all, my elder
daughter-in-law Sweetie,
[23:23] clean her room.
[23:25] See, she came from broad,
[23:27] they don't have dust in their houses,
her room should shine like a glass.
[23:31] Don't worry mother,
just see my magic.
[23:34] Rania my child, come sit with me.
[23:38] It’s our house, my child,
[23:41] what happened? You look upset.
[23:44] Grandmother, here you go, car keys.
[23:48] Give them to Aunt Sweetie
[23:50] and tell her she can take the car
if she wants to go shopping.
[23:55] You did really well my child,
Sweetie is also a part of the family,
[24:00] what good is fighting with family?
[24:02] I’ve made a decision,
[24:03] now just waiting to see
if it results good or bad.
[24:06] I think you made a right decision.
[24:09] See, Sweetie isn’t a bad person,
[24:12] since she got here,
[24:14] she’s trying to adjust with us,
and we should support her.
[24:23] Mother your maid came back
[24:26] but I made breakfast
with my own hands,
[24:29] I also served it on the table,
just going to get the fresh juice.
[24:32] You did really good,
[24:34] I want to try the breakfast
my daughter-in-law prepared,
[24:39] it’ll taste different.
[24:41] Rania, come and help aunt.
[24:44] No, no, let it be mother,
[24:46] she’s a guest, today she’s here,
[24:49] tomorrow she’ll be somewhere else.
I can’t expect a guest to help.
[24:56] I’m understanding really well,
[24:58] what you’re trying to convey to me.
[25:06] Where are you going? Breakfast.
[25:09] I’m not hungry.
[25:10] Oh you naughty girl,
I understand everything,
[25:12] you want to go out in the name
of university
[25:15] then you’ll have fun and
go to the restaurants, right?
[25:19] I should eat.
Me too.
[25:26] Excuse me.
You want egg?
[25:28] Yes, yes.
[25:33] Thank you.
Young kids,
[25:35] they have bigger appetites.
[25:39] Thank you, thank you,
Sweetie, thank you.
[25:46] Carefully Dabeer,
don’t burn any dress,
[25:48] or what am I going
to tell your mother?
[25:50] Sorry, sorry, Sweetie.
[25:53] There as such soft fabrics,
[25:56] I am afraid to put a cold iron on it
[25:59] and you want me to hot iron these?
What am I going to do?
[26:03] Dabeer, talk less and work more.
[26:07] I already thought of so many other
chores that you are going to do.
[26:10] Have mercy on me Sweetie,
I was wrong to come here,
[26:14] I’ll never come back to Pakistan
in my life again.
[26:17] I swear on my father.
[26:18] If you want me to, I can draw lines
with my nose like this.
[26:22] Don’t try to act oppressed,
do you understand?
[26:26] What do you think,
why am I asking you to do all this?
[26:28] It’s good for you it’s adding your points,
[26:30] when people will appreciate your wife,
[26:32] won’t you like it? You will, right?
[26:34] I would, I would like it very much,
[26:37] my example is like
that daughter-in-law
[26:39] that works like a donkey all they
[26:42] and the daughter takes credit
at the end of the day.
[26:45] Right?
[26:46] You’ve been speaking a lot since
you came back to Pakistan.
[26:53] Mahir, this is your step-mother
[26:56] but both are exactly the same.
Both are dramatic.
[27:20] 95, 96, 99,
[27:24] 10,000.
[27:26] Sister I completed 10,000 steps.
[27:28] Shehenshah, take this,
have some water, you must be tired.
[27:33] Yes, yes, drink it.
[27:35] I’ve brought a lot of gifts
for you from America.
[27:38] You don’t say. Give me.
[27:40] Not now, I will give it
to you later, later.
[27:44] Hey Rania, you’re back so soon
from the university?
[27:48] Well now that you’re back so soon,
go and work in the kitchen, go.
[27:52] What are you saying aunt,
[27:54] I’m a guest,
[27:55] and guests don’t do the house chores.
[27:57] And also I didn’t come from the university
to work in the kitchen,
[28:02] what are you saying?
[28:07] Wow, whose bike is this? Friend’s?
[28:12] Why would it be friend’s? It’s my own.
[28:16] Can I ride it?
[28:17] You can ride it later, but first,
come let me give you a round on this.
[28:21] No, I want to ride it on my own.
[28:22] Yes, yes, ride it,
come on.
[28:25] Shehenshah,
take my bag inside.
[28:31] Hold tight.
[28:35] Bye.
[28:46] Now it’s decided,
[28:47] now you both will travel on the bike,
[28:51] you won’t get the car ever.
[28:53] Madam Sweetie has decided.
[29:03] Greetings Doctor.
[29:05] Greetings.
[29:07] That, you.
[29:10] You came alone?
[29:11] It wasn’t an occasion to bring along a band,
so I had to come alone.
[29:15] No, I meant to say, Rania.
[29:21] I mean, Ms. Rania also had to come,
father was telling me.
[29:25] Yes, Rania had to come,
[29:27] but Mahir was there and she had to go
with him so she couldn’t come.
[29:31] Why?
[29:32] Were you waiting for her?
[29:35] Obviously,
[29:37] when you know come has to come,
[29:39] you wait for them.
[29:41] Did you tell Rania?
[29:45] What?
[29:45] That, that you miss her.
[29:52] No, when did I say that?
[29:57] You didn’t say but understood
without saying.
[30:01] You like meeting and
talking to Rania.
[30:05] But you’re scared to even
admit it to yourself, right?
[30:12] Maybe.
[30:13] Okay, I’ll do one thing,
[30:15] I’ll talk to Rania for you,
[30:17] I’ll say what you are not able
to express.
[30:20] No, no, no, don’t do this,
[30:24] I think I should be the one telling
this to her.
[30:28] Yes, you’re right doctor.
[30:30] Well, I loved to hear
this secret from you.
[30:34] Rania is a really sweet person,
you’ve made a perfect decision.
[30:43] Thank you.
[30:46] Okay tell me, where is father?
[30:48] Father, is in his room,
[30:51] I don’t know
why he has been sad lately,
[30:54] he seems lost.
[30:55] That’s why I was saying,
[30:58] father would’ve liked it
if Rania had come.
[30:59] Can I meet him? I’ll check
his blood pressure
[31:02] and you know my company is great,
he’ll be happy with me.
[31:08] Please.
[31:14] What will be the reaction of Rania
after listening to me?
[31:20] Mahir seems to like having
a right over Rania,
[31:25] so do they have something?
[31:29] Where did you bring me?
[31:32] I told you I don’t want to go very far.
[31:34] Hey it doesn’t matter Rania, get off.
[31:36] Today I’ve bought a new bike,
[31:39] in the joy of getting a new bike
I’m giving you a treat.
[31:43] Randomly?
Forceful treat?
[31:45] I don’t want it, I told you we’d stay
near the neighborhood.
[31:49] Okay dude,
but we’re here already,
[31:51] look how nice the restaurant is,
[31:53] and how delicious the food would be.
Come in.
[31:55] I told you, I don’t want to eat,
take me home.
[31:58] Are you having issues
with your dressing?
[32:01] Because this is a nice place
[32:03] and you’re dressing like this,
is it the reason?
[32:07] I don’t care about such things,
[32:09] only you are concerned with the outfits
[32:12] because your thinking starts from
the shoes and ends with the dresses.
[32:15] I have a very progressive mindset,
[32:18] and I’m happy the way I am.
[32:20] And secondly,
[32:22] if you spend here then you’ll have to
tell your new mother when we reach home,
[32:26] and I don’t want her dollars
to be spent on me.
[32:29] Oh, no, no.
[32:31] I bought this bike with my own money,
[32:33] I get rent for the property,
[32:36] and the treat I’ll give you,
it’ll also be my money.
[32:39] Come on dude,
let’s go inside, please.
[32:41] Can I ask why are you being
so kind to me?
[32:45] You have a lot of friends,
[32:48] then why me?
[32:50] Just,
[32:52] because I wanted to give you a treat.
[32:56] You want to, but I don’t,
[32:59] and I’m not obligated to your wants,
do you understand?
[33:02] So you go inside, eat, drink, enjoy.
[33:06] I’m taking a rickshaw to home.
[33:07] Hey, stop, stop, stop.
[33:09] Do you know you’re a little crazy.
[33:11] Not a little, I’m completely crazy, happy?
[33:15] Now I’m going.
Okay wait, stop.
[33:21] Sit, I’ll drop you.
[33:24] Sit and hold tight,
I’ll ride fast I’m angry.
[33:40] No, you’re ungrateful, it’s enough
now pack your bags.
[33:47] You, here?
[33:48] Yes it’s my home,
it’s my choice wherever I sit.
[33:51] Well it’s your love that
you think of this as your own house.
[33:55] No, no, no, no. It’s my dollars
[33:58] that make me this of this house
as my own.
[34:00] Oh, why are you discussing
these boring things?
[34:03] Let me show you something.
[34:07] Look at this,
[34:09] darling Khawar gave me a gift.
It’s really expensive.
[34:13] Very nice,
[34:14] your Khawar seems not only rich
but generous as well.
[34:17] Yes, and not only Khawar,
[34:20] his father, his brother
all of them are generous,
[34:24] that’s why I got her engaged
to that family.
[34:27] If I had left it on her she would have.
[34:29] Okay, enough,
she understood.
[34:32] You don’t have to tell everything why are you
always trying to make fun of me, be quiet.
[34:37] This, Rania and Mahir used to go for
such outings for so long earlier as well?
[34:40] What can I say, we don’t have enough
spare time to keep an eye on others.
[34:46] When will Rania come?
[34:48] Oh, what do you think,
she’ll be back soon?
[34:51] Don’t even think like that.
[34:53] She went with Mahir,
[34:55] she’ll roam around and
spend his money,
[34:57] and anyway does anyone
say no to a free party?
[35:00] She won’t be back on time,
keep in mind.
[35:03] These middle-class girls from
small cities are like this.
[35:08] Well, she won’t get Mahir
or this property.
[35:13] Hello.
[35:15] Hello.
[35:17] Why are they looking at us like this?
[35:20] Habitual, getting jealous.
[35:23] You love to act, let’s do this.
[35:27] Greetings. Greetings.
[35:30] You went for a round,
it took you too long.
[35:33] Actually, aunt Sweetie,
[35:35] I’m a middle-class, naive,
[35:38] narrow-minded girl
from a small city,
[35:41] so when I saw the lights here
I was amazed,
[35:45] didn’t want to come back.
[35:47] Hey Rania, what are you saying?
[35:49] Why hide from them?
[35:52] Actually aunt Sweetie you know
I bought a new bike.
[35:55] So for that, I took her for a treat,
[35:58] then for dinner then juice
we got late in all that.
[36:03] Well Rania,
you were absolutely right,
[36:06] the car isn’t as much fun,
[36:08] compared to roaming around
the city on a bike.
[36:10] If you’ve bought a new bike,
will you only give a treat to her?
[36:12] Not to us?
[36:13] Yes, she’s right, all of us want a treat.
[36:17] Oh yes, I’ll call Khawar as well.
[36:21] Well no,
[36:22] you’ll go to some casual place,
[36:24] and my darling is used to of going
to 5-star hotels in Karachi.
[36:28] If he eats at small places
he’ll get food poison,
[36:31] you know food poison.
Stop it madam,
[36:34] keep your mouth shut,
[36:35] I know you and your
monkey husband very well,
[36:39] you’re talking.
[36:40] He grew up in front of me
in my city,
[36:42] I know him since his childhood.
[36:44] After school, he grew up buying chicken
claw soup from roadside cart for 15/- rupees.
[36:51] You’ve insulted her recent fiancé,
[36:54] let her show off
In front of aunt Sweetie.
[36:57] She is newly engaged,
it’s justified.
[36:59] Well not everyone gets a fiancé,
[37:02] only the fortunate ones get fiancé.
[37:04] Tell me more, how is Bebo,
did you find a suitor for her?
[37:07] Well we should all pray for her,
[37:11] her aunt is getting old but
she’s not getting any proposals.
[37:14] My Bebo gets proposals all day,
there is a queue for proposals
[37:18] but my Bebo is not desperate like Mona,
[37:22] to get any cartoon and
get engaged instantly.
[37:25] Do you remember,
[37:26] remember how khawar was looking
at his engagement?
[37:31] At Asma’s age girls shouldn’t be choosy,
[37:34] we compromise at this age.
[37:37] Age doesn’t matter aunt Sweetie,
[37:40] whatever one has in his fate he gets it.
[37:44] Take your example,
[37:45] when you married my father
[37:48] you were 10-15 years older than Bebo,
[37:51] yet you found a gem like my father, right.
[37:55] So Bebo will find as well.
[37:58] Dabeer,
[38:00] I’ll go and see what Dabeer is doing.
[38:07] And you, listen to me very clearly,
[38:11] don’t brag all the time,
your fiance?
[38:14] The one with the face of a dead snake,
talk to him only.
[38:26] That’s what happens to people
who hurt their elder sisters.
