[00:17] Thank you for inviting me,
[00:20] to be honest,
I’ve enjoyed after a long time.
[00:24] I had stopped doing all this,
going to the gatherings like this.
[00:27] Then you should keep visiting,
think of us as your family.
[00:32] Just like how we think of you
as our family.
[00:35] That is so nice of you Rania.
[00:37] Hopefully I’ll be like this.
[00:38] Hopefully.
[00:40] The whole venue is empty,
[00:43] all the guests have left,
[00:45] only one or two are remaining.
[00:47] We’ll rest once they leave,
we’re tired.
[00:51] No, I’m not tired yet,
we’ll tease Mona all night.
[00:58] Rania, allow me to go,
we’ll meet soon.
[01:01] I’ll say it’s better to meet
the doctor as late as possible.
[01:07] You’re humorous,
you’re good at jokes.
[01:11] Bye Rania.
But, tea.
[01:13] Some other day,
father is waiting for me.
[01:18] Okay, but do tell father,
I would’ve liked if he had come.
[01:22] Pay my regards to him.
[01:24] Yes, sure.
Bye.
[01:28] Bye.
[01:30] Doctor, come let me walk you
to the door.
[01:34] Yes, yes, let’s go.
[01:35] No, no there, this side, come.
[01:43] Did you see it yesterday?
[01:45] Rania was giving a little too much
attention to Dr. Wasiq,
[01:50] I don’t know what the conversation
was about that wasn’t ending.
[01:53] I have been observing Mr. Mahir,
[01:56] aren’t you getting a little sensitive
over Rania?
[01:59] Walk a little carefully,
be cautious,
[02:02] don’t confess your love she’ll reject.
[02:06] Rania is a different type.
[02:10] Oh Rania is pretentious,
[02:13] she only pretends to be cold.
[02:16] It’s my experience dude,
I’ve seen it in her eyes.
[02:20] Secretly, she’s into me,
just like other girls.
[02:25] She loves me, she’s always after me,
I’ve seen it.
[02:30] You’ll see,
[02:32] I’ll have her confess her love
by herself.
[02:37] Do you bet?
[03:05] Well, jokes apart,
[03:08] she’s good at heart,
[03:10] she thinks good for everyone,
she helps everyone.
[03:15] She is a nice girl.
You are right.
[03:25] I always knew how egocentric you are,
[03:28] but I didn’t realize you think
that low of me.
[03:36] I am sad,
[03:38] I am disappointed in you,
I can never trust you again.
[03:44] But I will never let you know
[03:46] that I have seen your real face,
[03:49] that I am aware of your mindset.
[04:02] Rania,
[04:04] what happened,
why did you bring back the tea?
[04:07] I forgot the sugar,
[04:12] it’s there now,
you can take it to them.
[04:15] Listen?
[04:17] What happened Rania,
[04:19] is something to worry about?
You were crying?
[04:22] No, why would I cry without any reason?
[04:25] The tea is getting cold, please take it.
[04:31] There is something, she’s not like this.
[05:16] You’re down bad, Mr. Mahir.
[05:19] You used to think this girl will also fall
for you one day just like other girls.
[05:28] Instead you are the one madly
in love with her,
[05:32] and there is no way back.
[05:49] Hello.
[05:55] Oh, hello, hello, hello?
Where are you lost?
[05:58] I’m grilling the corns,
want some?
[06:02] Why are you getting so rude?
[06:05] I asked you a random question,
and such a bitter answer?
[06:10] Because I am not a random girl and
do not mistake me for a random girl.
[06:23] What happened to her,
[06:25] she was fine till the engagement.
[06:27] Mr. Mahir, you fell in love with her
and she got arrogant?
[06:46] Are you studying?
[06:48] Good,
[06:51] you can ask me if there is anything.
[07:01] Also I’m really good in.
This subject.
[07:30] Oh, wow mother, wow,
vegetables and hooves.
[07:36] Wow mother, I really
don’t want to go back.
[07:42] Do you remember the time
[07:44] when all you wanted was
to go to America,
[07:48] I said no multiple times yet
you didn’t understand.
[07:53] You got on the plane wilfully.
[07:58] You are right mother,
I made a big mistake.
[08:04] Well mother Pakistan has
also changed drastically,
[08:08] people here are not like
how they used to be.
[08:11] I would say people’s looks have changed,
[08:15] their lifestyle has changed but the love
in their hearts, it’s the same.
[08:21] Oh brother, you’re here, I have been
looking for you everywhere.
[08:24] I need to talk to you about
something very important.
[08:27] Yes, yes, tell me what is it?
[08:31] Your younger brother.
[08:33] What happened to him?
He is a 100% useless and idle.
[08:36] Eat, sleep, repeat,
eat, sleep, repeat.
[08:39] Bed to sofa to bed to sofa.
[08:40] For God’s sake take him
to America with you,
[08:43] make him work at a store,
do whatever you want.
[08:48] Haven’t you asked
for something easy?
[08:52] Like it’s a child’s play for me?
[08:55] Oh, thank you, thank you so much,
I’ll tell the good news to Hammad.
[08:59] Hey, hey Seema, wait a minute.
[09:03] Tell me about it, mother.
[09:04] What am I saying?
What is she comprehending?
[09:17] Are you making tea?
[09:19] A cup for me too.
[09:25] Can you also fry an egg?
[09:28] Half fry.
[09:30] But please make sure
the yolk doesn’t break,
[09:32] if it breaks then.
It’s hard to eat.
[09:38] Why are you upset?
[09:40] Have you taken a vow of silence?
[09:44] You should mind your own business.
[09:52] And you?
[09:55] What about when you meddle in
everyone’s business, nothing about that?
[09:59] I help them for their own good,
[10:02] there is a big difference
between you and me.
[10:04] What is the big difference,
we should also get to know.
[10:09] Try telling me what’s in your heart,
[10:12] who knows I might be able to help.
[10:15] Only talk about things
you can control,
[10:19] don’t brag all the time.
[10:24] You fried a really nice egg.
[10:31] It looks like you measured.
What did you do?
[10:33] Why did you break the yolk, I told you
I don’t eat eggs with runny yolks.
[10:37] Really?
[10:38] Then make one for yourself,
[10:40] because I can’t do anything else
for you at the moment.
[10:43] Rania, Rania, stop.
[10:47] Why are you so upset with me,
what did I do?
[10:52] You would know what you did,
[10:54] and I am like this,
do you have any objection?
[10:58] Why would I have
an objection to that?
[11:00] Stay whatever you are,
how does it matter to me.
[11:04] Exactly.
[11:06] Okay listen,
[11:10] remember you said you want
to learn how to drive,
[11:13] I am free today I can teach you.
[11:17] I’m really good.
No, thanks.
[11:19] Actually I have changed my mind,
[11:21] I don’t have a car,
I’ll learn when I’ll have one.
[11:25] And you shouldn’t really
with thinking about me,
[11:28] because it won’t help you.
[11:40] I don’t know what happened to her.
[11:44] Sister, sister,
[11:46] I want to talk to you about
something important.
[11:48] Yes, I’m listening.
[11:50] Sister, I have made a decision,
I’ll apply for a job.
[11:53] What? Repeat that.
[11:55] I can’t stay idle, sister.
Please arrange a job for me.
[11:58] But you wanted to start
a business.
[11:59] That was my childhood,
I’ve matured now.
[12:04] You’re not kidding?
[12:05] Serious, sister, a 100% serious,
[12:07] whatever the job will be, I’ll do it.
[12:10] Farhad,
[12:12] have you been listening to
what your uncle is saying?
[12:14] We should distribute the sweets.
[12:16] Yes sure but I am trying to find out
how could he change suddenly.
[12:23] You’re misbehaving?
[12:24] What?
[12:25] I’m 4 years older than you.
2 years.
[12:28] You’re demotivating me after
I have made my decision to have a job.
[12:32] Sister, do something sister,
make some arrangements.
[12:35] Just think you’ve got a job.
[12:37] I’ve got a job?
Yes, absolutely.
[12:39] If I’ve got a job then
[12:41] we should tease about marriage as well.
[12:44] What? Is it a girl that we tease?
[12:47] Ayaz, there is something, I’ve been
noticing something is different.
[12:54] The wise man was right,
[12:56] you can’t hide love
or fragrance.
[12:59] What?
[13:01] Love?
Love.
[13:05] Oh, oh, God!
[13:07] I thought he was getting on
a straight path,
[13:10] he’s lost even more.
[13:12] Ayaz, your love can go to hell,
[13:14] I won’t let you marry anyone
without proper inquiry.
[13:32] What happened,
[13:36] you are lost in thoughts?
[13:38] Nothing, uncle.
[13:40] I am missing Bebo,
[13:42] I’m sad, you should call her.
[13:52] Should I serve you tea?
[13:55] You’re so shy,
[13:57] when you smile it seems like
the clouds are growling.
[14:03] Rani.
[14:05] Don’t announce there that
Bebo insisted so we came.
[14:09] But you said you wanted to meet aunt,
what’s wrong if I tell them?
[14:14] Don’t you understand
what I am saying?
[14:17] I was getting bored at home so I thought
we should visit the neighbours.
[14:24] Okay then let’s go inside.
[14:25] Oh my luck, oh my luck,
[14:28] great people are visiting today.
[14:30] Well I was just thinking about you.
[14:35] Why?
[14:36] Because, b, that.
She’s a guest,
[14:40] so that’s why,
if she’s feeling lonely.
[14:43] Rabail isn’t here?
Oh, poor Rabail is stuck,
[14:47] grandmother forbid her,
[14:48] she told her not to visit
before marriage.
[14:51] Okay, that’s fine.
[14:54] There, your student is waiting for you.
[14:56] Where?
There, sitting right there.
[14:59] Laiba.
[15:02] That’s a great custom at your house,
[15:04] before you also get
the same restrictions,
[15:06] I should show you around.
[15:08] Randomly, just to know the house.
[15:12] What are you talking about?
[15:14] Very serious,
[15:16] I have applied for a job Asma.
[15:19] The place where I applied had
so many referrals
[15:23] and I was the only one on merit.
[15:25] They took my interview,
the boss asked if I had a source,
[15:29] I said no, I gave a really good interview.
[15:31] When sister calls, then they’ll hire me
because it’s sister’s company.
[15:35] So she was saying
it will be confirmed.
[15:37] That is a really good news.
[15:39] As soon as I’ll get the job
I’ll get sweets for you.
[15:44] Didn’t you get informal a little too fast?
[15:47] Enough time is wasted already,
[15:49] so why shouldn’t we do everything soon.
[15:53] Come, let me show you around
before you get restricted.
[15:58] These plants.
[16:00] Let me go tell the mother.
[16:01] What?
[16:02] That you came.
[16:04] Oh, yes, let’s go.
[16:11] What is this matter?
[16:15] There is a whole film going on right under
my nose and I didn’t find out?
[16:20] That’s enough,
[16:23] but am I misunderstanding?
[16:26] No,
[16:29] I don’t know.
[16:33] Rania, can I tell you some good news?
[16:36] This brother of mine,
has completely changed.
[16:40] He’s changed? How?
[16:43] He has started talking wisely,
[16:45] he wakes up early in the morning
and goes jogging,
[16:47] even has breakfast on time.
[16:49] And he is even worried about a job,
also he has been pleasant lately.
[16:53] He’s even humming sometimes.
[16:56] Sister, mention the poetries also,
the ones I say.
[16:59] Yes, yes, he has also been doing poetry.
[17:02] If you don’t mind can I say a couplet?
[17:05] Yes, yes, say it.
[17:06] The couplet goes,
This love isn’t easy, think of it as.
[17:13] This love isn’t easy,
think of it as.
[17:22] It is a river of fire and
you have to dive in it.
[17:31] Drown, drown.
[17:33] Drown in it, drown in it,
the same thing.
[17:35] Wow, wow, another one uncle.
[17:38] Another couplet by Meer Sard.
[17:40] He said it in the winters of Siberia.
It’s cold.
[17:43] Box in a box, box in a box,
cake in a box.
[17:50] Box in a box, cake in a box.
[17:56] My neighbor, one in a million.
[18:06] Wow, loved it,
it was amazing.
[18:09] Let’s have another one.
[18:12] Another couplet...
Ayaz, Ayaz, stop, enough for today.
[18:15] Okay sister.
[18:18] Well aunt, uncle has changed completely.
[18:22] Yes, I think he is in love with someone.
[18:30] Love? love,
with whom?
[18:34] That’s what we have to find out.
[18:36] But it isn’t difficult for me
I will find out the girl.
[18:40] Okay whenever you find out,
you have to tell me.
[18:43] It is not something to mention,
[18:44] I will tell you and if the girl is nice,
[18:47] we will take the proposal.
[18:49] We will take aunt as well.
[18:50] Yes, why not.
[18:51] No, not Bebo, not Bebo,
Bebo will be there,
[18:54] I mean both of you will be there,
and Bebo too, we’ll all be there.
[18:58] Yes, we will be together,
will be together.
[19:04] I have a collection of some rare books,
[19:06] if you have some spare time,
[19:08] can we go to the library? Both of us?
[19:13] Let’s go?
[19:18] Grandmother, what are you doing
here sitting alone?
[19:21] My child, my reports have
arrived from the hospital,
[19:27] I want to show them to Dr. Wasiq.
[19:30] I’ll send it to him
when Mahir arrives.
[19:33] To Dr. Wasiq?
[19:42] Master, should I get you lunch?
[19:47] Go away.
[19:48] Master, you haven’t taken
the medicine yet,
[19:50] and the doctor said.
I told you to go,
[19:54] and don’t try to scare me with doctors.
[19:57] Yes.
[20:07] Greetings.
Greetings.
[20:11] Wasiq is at the hospital,
you can visit him there.
[20:16] But I’m here to meet you.
Me?
[20:21] I don’t like to meet people
nor do I feel the need to.
[20:26] But I really need to meet you.
[20:28] I mean,
[20:29] I am here to tell you
why I wanted to meet you.
[20:33] Just give me a few minutes,
please.
[20:37] You won’t go without saying
what you want.
[20:41] Come on.
[20:50] Actually, my father has died,
[20:57] I have only seen him in pictures.
[21:02] When I saw you for the first time,
[21:07] it felt like my father came alive
from the pictures in front of me.
[21:12] I swear uncle,
[21:13] believe me,
I am telling the truth.
[21:17] Your face exactly resembles
my father’s.
[21:24] Maybe that’s why,
I want to be in your company,
[21:29] keep talking to you.
[21:33] Yes, but there is nothing
unusual about it,
[21:39] I mean a lot of people resemble
each other,
[21:44] they have some similarities.
[21:47] But you know the truth
[21:51] so you know that your father
is not alive anymore.
[21:58] Still coming after a man like this,
[22:00] who isn’t even related to you,
[22:03] it isn’t appropriate for a girl like you.
[22:08] You don’t have a daughter
[22:12] maybe that’s why you can’t understand
[22:15] what my feelings are.
[22:19] You don’t know the importance
of a father for his daughter.
[22:25] No, it is nothing like this.
[22:29] I mean to say,
[22:31] I understand your feelings
[22:34] but I can’t do anything about them.
[22:38] I can just advise you,
[22:41] learn to face the reality.
[22:45] Look, you are a really nice girl,
[22:48] don’t run after an illusion like this.
[22:54] Now go,
[22:56] go to your home.
[23:00] Yes.
[23:04] Bye.
[23:06] And listen,
[23:11] take care of yourself.
[23:23] Does my daughter also look for
my reflection in every random stranger?
[23:29] Feels my absence just like this?
[23:43] Your neighbors are such nice people,
I really liked them,
[23:47] very welcoming and sociable.
Really good.
[23:51] Right? Everyone is so nice
and that family.
[23:55] Well how did you like meeting Farhad?
[23:58] Farhad is also nice,
but his uncle, he’s really nice.
[24:05] You liked uncle?
[24:07] Why? He’s not nice?
[24:11] Where’s Rania?
[24:12] Rania isn’t home,
[24:14] you can tell me if there is something.
[24:16] Why would I have something?
[24:18] What work of mine stops
if Rania isn’t there?
[24:22] I was just randomly asking,
[24:25] and Bebo did you notice one thing?
[24:27] This Rani does not stay home,
[24:30] like it’s okay if you know
how to ride a bike, it’s okay,
[24:32] but that doesn’t mean you can go anywhere,
anytime whenever you want.
[24:36] One should also stay at home,
right?
[24:38] What happened,
don’t say this.
[24:40] Grandmother is not well,
she went to Dr. Wasiq.
[24:42] Dr. Wasiq,
[24:45] it seems like there is only Dr. Wasiq
in this whole city
[24:49] who has been blessed by God to have
some special cure for everything.
[24:52] The patient, even before
getting his medicine,
[24:55] gets cured just by getting
in front of him. Wow.
[24:59] When Rania returns,
you should tell her,
[25:02] these Dr. Wasiq type people are really
frauds and scammers.
[25:06] How do you know
if his degree is real or fake?
[25:09] I really don’t like Dr. Wasiq.
[25:14] Why does he have a problem
with Dr. Wasiq?
[25:21] He’s right,
[25:23] he does not have any relation with me,
[25:25] only his face resembles my father.
[25:28] But my face doesn’t resemble
any of his sister or daughter.
[25:39] The way I think emotionally of him,
[25:43] he cannot think like that.
[25:46] Rania,
[25:49] what happened?
[25:50] Why are you sitting like this,
alone? Sad?
[25:53] I’m not sad.
[25:56] That, Mahir was asking for you.
[26:00] You’re also an idiot,
just go wherever you want,
[26:03] don’t you have to ask for permission?
[26:05] I took permission from grandmother.
[26:08] And this complain?
Mahir must’ve said this?
[26:11] No, no, he was just asking,
[26:14] he was worried for you.
[26:15] He does not care about me,
he just pretends.
[26:19] He just wants everyone
to do as he says.
[26:22] Why?
Is he our grandmother?
[26:25] What does he think of himself?
Random.
[26:28] You both were friends till yesterday?
[26:31] You both insulted that
poor Khawar together.
[26:34] And today you are talking about him
as if he is your old enemy.
[26:39] There was no friendship between us,
[26:41] and a girl like me can never be friends
with someone arrogant like him,
[26:46] he’s a hypocrite.
[26:48] There is nothing like that,
he is a nice guy.
[26:51] Yes, as if you’re really good
at recognizing people.
[26:56] What is your problem?
Did you have a fight with someone?
[26:59] No.
[27:00] Rania, listen to me.
[27:03] What are you going to say
and what do I listen?
[27:06] What I have heard is enough,
[27:08] that’s why always remember,
[27:11] a person is not what he seems like.
[27:16] Rania?
[27:20] Such an idiot she is.
[27:24] It’s my turn now, stop it.
[27:26] You’ll get powder on your face you
already have enough.
[27:31] Don’t worry, we’ll defeat them.
[27:33] Oh damn.
[27:35] Wow, wow.
[27:36] Here you go.
[27:37] I wish you had brought sister-in-law along,
I really want to meet her.
[27:42] Oh I came in a hurry,
[27:45] I’ll bring her the next time I’ll visit,
also she’s currently on bed rest.
[27:51] Think because you speak,
you’ve returned after 20 years,
[27:56] if your woman were that obedient,
you would’ve returned after 20 years?
[28:01] Oh, mother, what are you saying.
[28:05] It’s not casual,
[28:07] your son has a lot of command and
respect over Sweetie, yes.
[28:11] If I growl once,
[28:14] your daughter-in-law shivers like this,
like this, yes.
[28:19] It’s all about fate brother,
[28:21] I can’t even think of this dominance.
[28:24] But our fate isn’t that beautiful,
[28:26] I’d say mothers should ask for son’s
good fate as much as daughter’s.
[28:32] Mother, I think you didn’t pray
enough on my time,
[28:36] this is what I got as a wife.
[28:39] Stop this, stop,
[28:42] it’ll get very difficult for you to sit here
if I start my sad stories.
[28:47] This is a voice,
the bed is calling you,
[28:49] it isn’t used to staying alone without
you for a long time.
[28:52] Are you seeing this brother?
This, this is what she does to me.
[28:56] Every time, this,
I swear, enough.
[28:59] Hey my child,
wives don’t respect for no reason,
[29:02] a man should have a skill for that.
[29:05] Do one thing, try to adopt my personality,
then you’ll see.
[29:10] Hey, make your move.
[29:12] Brother, I’m having a headache.
[29:15] Are you seeing this mother?
Can you see?
[29:17] Learn, learn something
from your elder brother.
[29:20] Your wife already does not respect you,
[29:22] and when he will come
that Khawar, rat alike,
[29:24] he won’t even count you as anything.
[29:26] And I won’t tolerate that,
I’m warning you.
[29:39] It has been 20 years mother,
[29:41] the way she used to respect me
the first day,
[29:44] she still respects me the same way.
[29:48] There isn’t even an increase,
I mean a decrease in that.
[29:57] Hey mother, your son has her
on a tight leash.
[30:03] Mother, when I talk to her
in a firm tone,
[30:06] minus 20-degree centigrade,
negative, it’s ice cold mother.
[30:13] It’s a luxurious house.
The car is also big,
[30:17] must’ve taken a lot of my dollars.
[30:23] Dabeer, you’re gone.
[30:26] Hello? Madam,
who are you?
[30:28] Inside without permission?
[30:30] When I scold her,
she starts sweating.
[30:34] I have her in control.
Good job.
[30:37] I’ve tightened her leash.
[30:39] What stray cat is that?
[30:48] Oh sister, stop.
[30:49] Mother, she’s a strange woman,
[30:51] came straight to the house
without even introducing.
[30:53] Seems like she’s short on hearing.
[30:57] Mrs. Sweetie, you’re here?
[31:11] Sweetie.
[31:14] Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie.
Sweetie has arrived.
[31:17] I’ve gone crazy to see you,
in happiness, in happiness.
[31:23] How happy I am,
to see you.
[31:27] You were always mad,
I was blind who couldn’t see.
[31:32] She’s joking.
[31:37] Sweetie, you’re here for the first time,
after so long, greet them.
[31:42] Greetings.
[31:44] Greetings Sweetie sister-in-law.
Sweetie, mother, Sweetie.
[31:48] Greetings.
[31:50] Greetings, my elder daughter-in-law
has arrived.
[31:54] Yes Sweetie.
Come, Sweetie.
[31:57] Have a seat.
Sit, sit, sit.
[32:00] Introduce me to your mother
who is very sick,
[32:04] bedridden and you’re on her bedside
looking after her day and night.
[32:08] His mother is alright and healthy,
[32:11] tell me about yourself,
your leg was fractured?
[32:14] Mother is asking how are you?
[32:18] Yes your leg, it fractured into pieces,
it healed so soon?
[32:24] It’s really delicious,
really yummy, eat.
[32:27] Leg will be fractured now,
but not mine, someone else’s.
[32:33] That means you’ve been lying to me?
[32:36] For the last 20 years, you had been
in such pathetic company
[32:39] that you’ve learned to lie?
[32:41] Mother, I, I, I should go get Seema.
[32:44] Not only Seema,
call everyone to come
[32:47] and see what a wonder came
to our house.
[32:49] Sweetie, mother, sweetie.
[32:51] Yes, call everyone.
[32:56] Listen, you’re visiting your in-laws
for the first time,
[32:59] you should be wearing
something appropriate.
[33:02] What would people say?
People will come to meet you.
[33:06] Everyone in this house wear
nice clothes because of me.
[33:11] Dabeer, I really liked
this new house of mine.
[33:15] Yes, it’s really nice, it’s very good.
[33:18] Dabeer why are you standing
there like a cow?
[33:22] The owner of this house came
for the first time,
[33:25] go get me a cold drink.
[33:27] Hey, I’m reminded of my father’s farm
from cows of Sahiwal.
[33:33] Servant, leave the cold drink,
get me a chilled lassi.
[33:37] Go, go fast.
[33:38] And add malai on the lassi.
[33:44] I used to make lassi
by myself, like this.
[33:48] Hey, sister Rania,
sister Rabail.
[33:51] Go and see,
what arrived from America.
[33:54] What arrived?
I mean, see who came.
[33:57] Who came? Let’s go and see.
[34:00] I think this house will face
an apocalypse soon.
[34:03] What nonsense is this?
What apocalypse?
[34:05] What happened to him,
come let’s see.
[34:24] So many people,
is it a home or a guest house?
[34:27] Don’t put an evil eye on my family
[34:29] All this family is being fed in this house?
[34:31] What problem do you have?
[34:33] Excuse me I am talking to my husband
so you should keep quiet.
[34:39] Dabeer, what am I seeing?
So many people,
[34:43] that’s why my dollars get stolen
every now and then.
[34:45] Sweetie, be considerate.
[34:48] What do I care about?
[34:50] It seems like this house has
a whole wedding party.
[34:51] The wedding will also happen, soon.
[34:54] What? Dabeer,
what am I hearing?
[34:58] Hey Sweetie,
I’m becoming your fan,
[35:01] what a hairstyle, what a beauty,
what a dressing, wow.
[35:05] Thank you,
[35:06] well these comments are not new to me,
[35:08] I’ve been hearing these compliments
since an early age.
[35:11] Who is this, someone please introduce.
[35:14] Why would someone else introduce
I can introduce myself.
[35:19] Me, myself Sweetie,
came from America
[35:22] and I’m the owner of this house,
[35:24] where all of you are staying
without my permission.
[35:27] Mr. Dabeer introduce everyone,
why are you hiding in the back?
[35:32] Yes, yes, why not Sweetie,
why not.
[35:34] This, the one sitting in front of you
is my beloved mother.
[35:39] Yes, the one who didn’t like my arrival,
anyway carry on.
[35:43] This, this is Shehenshah,
[35:45] he’s not our servant
more like our son.
[35:48] This is Seema, my sister-in-law,
[35:51] along with her is my younger brother,
[35:53] what was your name?
[35:55] Hammad, Hammad.
Hammad, Hammad.
[35:57] These are his two children.
[35:59] This is Mano, this is Tipu.
[36:00] After that, it’s Rania,
[36:02] Rania is, mother’s cousin
who is just like a brother to her,
[36:06] she’s his granddaughter.
[36:07] And this, the sister of mine who died,
she’s her daughter.
[36:11] And that Mona,
she’s Seema’s younger sister.
[36:15] And the beautiful girl standing
on your right side,
[36:20] she’s mother’s adopted brother’s cousin
sister’s daughter.
[36:24] Mr. Dabeer, is it all or some
of your relatives remaining?
[36:28] Wait a minute, Sweetie,
let me breathe.
[36:33] You forgot to introduce him my crown.
[36:36] Yes, this is my son, Mahir.
[36:40] So this is the prince
[36:44] that calls every week to annoy us
about the dollars.
