[00:19] Oh, I swear Mian Jee,
I really wanted to meet you.
[00:24] Without seeing you
I had considered me my Mian Jee.
[00:28] Do you have any objection?
[00:30] No child, what is there to object?
[00:32] You consider me your Mian Jee,
I consider you my daughter.
[00:35] Oh. Thank you Mian Jee.
[00:43] I don’t know
if Mahir is eating diet food or not.
[00:46] Rania, child, what did you get cooked?
[00:49] Rice and lentils, curry of organic
chicken without oil and spices.
[00:54] Without oil and spices?
[00:57] This sounds like the menu
of Dr. Wasiq’s hospital.
[01:00] Mian Jee is absolutely fine.
[01:03] Sorry, I don’t know what I was thinking.
[01:06] What is the deal?
Is there some worry? is all fine?
[01:09] Yes. no.
[01:11] Huh? Yes and no.
[01:15] Both things. I don’t understand.
[01:17] Are you fine, child?
[01:18] Mama had to come, she still hasn’t come.
[01:21] All my focus is over there.
[01:23] in fact, I will call her and ask.
[01:25] I don’t know if she reached or not.
[01:28] She should make sure she scolds him as soon as
she reaches and she shouldn’t listen to anyone.
[01:31] She needs to be strict.
[01:35] Hey, Rania, what are you saying?
Why will she pull our ears?
[01:41] I don’t know what is wrong with me?
[01:43] I think I have gone mad in
the happiness of you people coming here.
[01:47] We think the same way.
I think that is it.
[01:53] I don’t believe it, did this really happen?
You said something like this about a girl.
[01:59] You know, may God not even
give an enemy a friend like you.
[02:03] Mahir, I ruined your image in
front of another girl. Sorry.
[02:08] I will deal with you later.
[02:10] My health…
[02:14] grandma.
[02:15] Mahir.
[02:16] Grandma, you. Greetings.
[02:20] Greetings. Greetings. Oh my son.
[02:25] Greetings, grandma.
[02:27] Greetings.
I will teach you a lesson today.
[02:29] You didn’t even bother to
tell us that the child is unwell.
[02:33] Mahir, Rania told us that you are unwell.
[02:36] What?
[02:37] Rania told you people?
[02:39] Leave all this, and now come home.
Come on. Come home.
[02:45] Honey, this is Mahir’s grandmother and
that is his uncle and this is Honey, my cousin.
[02:50] She has come from America.
[02:51] Greetings.
[02:53] Greetings.
Greetings. Live long. Live long.
[02:56] Grandma, you ask Mahir,
how much she has cared for him.
[02:59] Really?
[03:00] I don’t have the words to thank you.
[03:04] There is nothing like that.
[03:06] Salik brings her over, bring her to our home.
Sure. Sure.
[03:10] Come on, lets go home.
That’s it. It is enough.
[03:16] No grandma,
[03:18] I don’t want to go to anywhere.
[03:19] Hey,
[03:21] good children don’t argue.
Right now, come home.
[03:24] When you get well, you can make another
reason and leave home. Come on.
[03:28] No.
[03:30] Till the time aunt Sweetie
is in that home, I wont go.
[03:36] You people don’t worry at all.
We will take care of Mahir really well.
[03:41] Yes. I know that but
what do I do about my heart.
[03:46] Till the time he is not in front of my eyes,
I don’t find peace.
[03:50] Look at him, see,
my lion has such a small face like a bird.
[03:56] So I cannot leave him in this illness, and go.
[04:01] Come on, Mahir , take out your things,
I will not leave you here in this illness.
[04:05] Come on, come on.
[04:06] Mahir, you drink the soup,
we will talk about the rest with it.
[04:10] I don’t want to drink anything.
Please. Please.
[04:12] Hamad, you take out his things.
[04:14] Lets go then. We are getting late.
Then we also have to go over to Rania’s home.
[04:17] What?
[04:18] Rania’s home?
[04:20] Why?
[04:21] I won’t go to Rania’s home.
[04:22] Hear that, that poor child
agreed to keep you at her home,
[04:28] she will care for you and you are saying no.
You surprise me. I swear.
[04:33] Rania is ready to care for me?
[04:56] Thank you, child.
[04:58] Okay.
[05:06] Mian Jee,
[05:08] I have made Farhad my brother,
he is really interested in meeting you.
[05:13] Is this the same Farhad
whose proposal got fixed with Rabail?
[05:18] Yes. Yes.
[05:20] They are really good people, Mian Jee.
[05:22] And his uncle, uncle Ayaz,
he too is a good man. You meet him too.
[05:28] Our daughter Rania is praising him,
I am sure they will be good people.
[05:32] What else?
[05:34] By the way, Mian Jee,
[05:36] I have heard you do a lot
of social work in the village.
[05:39] Child, you people call it
social work in the city,
[05:43] we think that it is the responsibility
of one person to help another.
[05:46] Wow. Wow.
[05:48] Mian Jee you said something amazing.
[05:50] You are a great man and
you also have great thinking.
[05:55] By the way,
Dr. Wasiq really serves humanity.
[06:01] He has the pain for humanity inside him.
[06:05] And don’t think that he is single
because he failed in love.
[06:10] Actually, he never got time to
think about himself
[06:14] or else he is a good, decent,
friendly and caring doctor.
[06:20] Right? Right? Right?
[06:22] Yes, sure.
[06:24] When I asked him to go and check Mahir
cause he is unwell, he made a hundred excuses.
[06:31] Hey, Mahir is unwell?
Yes, Mian Jee.
[06:35] Oh, so you people are telling me right now.
[06:38] Actually, it is my own fault,
[06:40] I should have met him as soon as I came over.
[06:41] He is a good child.
I only for him with my heart.
[06:46] He has really cared.
He is a really good boy, I swear.
[06:56] Hmmm.
[06:58] Okay come on, eat.
What happened? What happened?
[07:03] Hello.
[07:05] Why are you messaging me again
and again like a young boy?
[07:08] No, no, I was just calling to confirm if you people
reached Rania’s home or not. I am worried.
[07:14] Yes, we have reached safely, don’t worry.
[07:18] and Rania has started her
mission as soon as we got here.
[07:21] She is busy praising you.
[07:23] No, no, Rania is a really good girl,
thank her from me.
[07:28] Actually, I wanted to ask
who can ask tougher questions?
[07:32] Mian Jee or brother?
[07:35] Actually, I have been in the bad habit
to getting papers leaked that
[07:39] if I find out right now, life will be easy.
So who will ask tougher questions?
[07:45] No. No.
Nothing like this will happen this time.
[07:48] You will have to come fully prepared.
[07:50] And you can expect strict
behavior from brother Zaman.
[07:55] Huh? What if brother says no.
[07:57] The palace of my dreams
will fall to the ground
[08:02] and what if I get killed under
the load of that palace.
[08:06] Do something. Do something.
[08:08] Oh, what are you saying?
[08:10] earlier I was not getting married
[08:11] and now finally I am getting married with difficulty
and you plan on making me a widow.,
[08:15] Hello. Yes Rabail,
did mama go to Mahir or not?
[08:18] Okay, thank God.
Now she should bring him or else…
[08:20] Here talk to Ayaz.
[08:22] Okay, I will talk to you later.
[08:24] I don’t want to talk to anyone.
You know that Mahir…
[08:27] Hey, leave that Mahir.
You talk to Ayaz, he is really worried.
[08:31] He is worried cause of brother Zaman
that he might mess things up.
[08:34] Here. Here. Here.
[08:37] Hello. Yes uncle.
[08:39] What happened? Why are you worried?
[08:41] I am here, I will take care of everything.
[08:42] After all, my papa has changed now.
[08:44] Still Rania, the heart is worried.
There is tension.
[08:47] Hey, what is wrong?
Nothing will happen, I am telling you.
[08:50] You just prepare to bring a proposal here.
[08:53] Still I have doubts that are bothering me.
[08:56] My heart is sinking. What do I do?
[08:59] Then I have an advice for you.
[09:01] Yes. Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Tell me.
[09:03] You don’t bother coming here,
sit at home and all the worries,
[09:08] tensions and doubts will be
removed at home themselves.
[09:10] Leave it. You let it be.
[09:12] If you, yourself have been
through such a situation,
[09:15] then you would know
what the heart goes through.
[09:18] How difficult it is to see your
love going away from you.
[09:25] Hello.
[09:26] Yes, Ayaz,
[09:29] no, no,
[09:30] why are you so worried?
[09:32] Nothing will happen.
[09:36] That is the problem.
[09:37] I am going through such a situation
and the one I am restless for,
[09:42] he doesn’t care about me even a little.
[09:44] This is my madness,
I had some other dreams,
[09:48] then why do I start thinking about
Mahir even when I don’t want to.
[09:53] If he finds out what is in my heart,
[09:56] he will celebrate his victory.
[09:58] He will make a lot of fun of me.
[10:03] Greetings mama.
Greetings child.
[10:07] Child, live long. Live long.
Greetings uncle.
[10:08] Greetings. Greetings.
[10:09] You did good that you went.
I was sure he wouldn’t ignore what you say.
[10:13] By the way, where is he?
[10:15] Who? Who are you talking about?
[10:17] Mahir. Did he not come?
[10:18] Child, he is really stubborn.
I insisted a lot but he didn’t agree.
[10:25] Then you should have
slapped him twice, mama.
[10:27] What is this? He is unwell
and at a friend’s place.
[10:30] What would Salik’s family be thinking that no one
cares about him, there is no one to care for him?
[10:34] No, child, there is nothing like that.
[10:37] See Salik is childhood friend,
[10:39] he loves him a lot, along with that
his family is also caring for him a lot.
[10:44] and that new guest that
has come to their home,
[10:47] that girl is really caring for him,
like she knows him for a life time.
[10:51] Greetings. Hello.
Greetings. Greetings.
[10:55] Greetings.
[10:56] You too are here. Very good. Very good.
The place must be really lively. How are you?
[11:02] I am just like before.
[11:04] But, I don’t think Rania is fine.
Right, Rania?
[11:08] And where is Mahir?
Why did he not come?
[11:11] Come on, brother Anwaar is waiting. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
[11:15] Come on.
[11:16] Rania, tell me,
why did Mahir not come?
[11:19] What do you mean why would he come?
[11:23] He is at his friend’s home,
his friend’s cousin has come over.
[11:27] She was going around him is
he mad that he will come?
[11:32] Oh God, thank you.
[11:43] I don’t believe it, Salik.
[11:47] Rania called grandma,
[11:50] she showed so much concern about my illness.
[11:55] Rania told grandma herself to
send Mahir to my home,
[12:00] I will take care of him.
[12:07] So don’t believe it.
[12:08] You have driven me mad saying
the same thing again and again. Please.
[12:13] Hey man,
[12:16] I am in a good mood, don’t spoil it.
[12:20] First let me enjoy this.
[12:24] By the way Salik,
[12:26] I think,
[12:29] that if Rania cares for me so much,
then why doesn’t she show it on my face?
[12:36] Right now she is observing you.
[12:39] She is seeing if you are really
worth her love or not.
[12:43] Hmmm…I am thinking the same.
[12:48] Rania must think that someone smart,
[12:52] dashing, rich and someone with
so many qualities like Mahir,
[12:57] am I worthy of him or not.
[13:02] This arrogance of yours
will get you killed one day.
[13:06] Your step mother did the right thing with you.
[13:09] Hey, hello, I am going to teach
a lesson to my step mother, you will see.
[13:15] I have to become a really
big businessman on my own.
[13:20] You wait and watch.
[13:21] When I go in front of her becoming
a successful man, it will be fun.
[13:27] Mahir.
[13:28] Oh man.
It is time for your fruits.
[13:30] This extra sweet bubble gum cousin of yours,
she has driven me mad.
[13:34] She is after me. I am leaving, you handle her.
[13:36] Okay. Okay.
[13:37] What on earth are you doing here?
You should be in the room.
[13:39] But anyway,
it is time for your fruits, sit down.
[13:44] You bothered for no reason,
what was the need for this?
[13:47] I want that you get fine soon,
so that we enjoy together.
[13:52] See the courage of my innocent cousin.
[13:55] She is planning on enjoying with
this bloody boring man. Idiot.
[14:00] You know you are a little boring.
[14:03] Actually, I didn’t understand
your behavior with your family.
[14:06] First that girl came, she was so cute,
you didn’t give her any importance.
[14:10] Then your grandma came,
you didn’t listen to her at all.
[14:12] What is the matter with you?
[14:13] This entire issue is because of that cute girl.
[14:18] I don’t get it.
[14:19] Hey, no, no, there is nothing
to understand in what he says.
[14:22] He is speaking nonsense.
Just ignore him.
[14:23] Yes. Yes. and you dive in
the depth of what he says, in fact memorize it.
[14:30] Salik, calm down.
Calm down, don’t fly so high.
[14:34] I feel I will have to complain
about you to Ifrah.
[14:36] Oh, I remembered Ifrah,
[14:38] how is she?
When are you making me meet her?
[14:40] and you, are you engaged?
[14:42] No. No. No. No.
[14:43] He doesn’t get engaged,
he only keeps hopes.
[14:47] That are broken often.
You be quiet.
[14:49] You come inside with me,
I will tell you more detail about him.
[14:52] Hey, you are leaving me here.
Okay, this..this fruit.
[14:55] Come on. Come on.
Should I not feed him this fruit?
[14:57] No. No. Come quickly.  Quick.
[14:58] Okay, one bite.
I am coming. I am coming.
[15:05] I should have gone with grandma.
[15:10] Yes. Yes.
[15:12] This shirt will look good on me.
See this, with flowers.
[15:15] Nonsense.
[15:17] If you wear this shirt and go in front of Mian Jee,
you know what he will think?
[15:21] The boy belongs to
a family of entertainers.
[15:23] He will clearly say no
to giving you his daughter.
[15:26] Really?
[15:27] Yes uncle, brother is right.
This doesn’t look good at all.
[15:31] Really? One minute. One minute.
[15:35] This one looks decent.
It looks decent on me, right? Sober.
[15:39] What is wrong with you?
[15:40] Your fashion sense is so old.
[15:44] If you wear this shirt and go,
then everyone will say no to the proposal.
[15:48] Tell me about this one little one. This one.
Tell me about this. It is brand new. I just got it.
[15:52] Wow. Wow.
Ayaz.
[15:54] Yes? Yes, sister?
[15:56] What have you done to the room?
I am showing off my shopping.
[16:00] Uncle was preparing to show off his shopping.
[16:02] Do people prepare to show
off their shopping like this?
[16:04] Then how do they do it, sister?
[16:06] Ayaz those people wont select you
seeing your shirt, print and stitching.
[16:13] If you have to work hard on something,
work on your personality.
[16:16] Yes, sister.
Yes,
[16:17] mama this is what I was explaining to him,
but he didn’t understand.
[16:21] Huh? When did this happen brother?
[16:23] Mama, brother was not helping him,
he was confusing him.
[16:27] Be quiet. I mean,
I was going to explain it…
[16:30] Okay be quiet.
[16:31] Ayaz pick up all these clothes
and hang them back.
[16:35] Yes, sister.
and listen to me carefully.
[16:37] Yes.
[16:38] If you fail in this interview,
you will see the worst in me.
[16:40] Sister,
[16:43] who wants to fail?
[16:46] I wish.
[16:47] I wish someone tells me what
the questions will be in the interview.
[16:52] What is the boy’s age?
Three years older than the nephew.
[16:54] What does the boy do?
Useless just like his nephew.
[16:57] Stop this nonsense.
[16:59] Ayaz, you fix your personality.
Yes, sister.
[17:03] From today, right now, start practicing.
Absolutely, I will start it right now.
[17:06] and the profile picture of yours on Insta.
I put it up today.
[17:09] Hey, remove it.
But why?
[17:10] you look like an elderly young man.
Huh? Really?
[17:12] This is the limit.
Who will make these people understand?
[17:14] Sister.
[17:16] Don’t worry, you need to
enhance your personality.
[17:20] How do I do that?
I will teach you how to walk.
[17:21] I walk? Okay,
how will I walk when I enter the home.
[17:26] Hey you are so stiff while walking.
What do I do?
[17:28] Hey, you have to marry the girl,
you don’t have to kidnap her.
[17:30] Yes.
With love with patience, decent walk.
[17:33] Decent, okay.
[17:36] Hey you are walking like a tired hen.
[17:38] With love, decent boy.
[17:39] Come on, get out. Get out.
Come on, child, go out. go out. Out! Out!
[17:45] He will teach me. he will teach his uncle.
[17:47] Hey, I….
[17:49] practice.
[17:51] Uncle, back.
[18:01] Hey, I am going to say something
to brother Anwaar and Zaman.
[18:06] That we are bringing a really good proposal
for Asma and I wont take no for an answer.
[18:14] Brother,
[18:16] why are you sitting here with such a long face?
Did you commit a big crime?
[18:20] Hey, no brother Hammad. Actually,
[18:22] I have seen that often boys from decent families
react like this, in such situation. I have seen this.
[18:28] Boy.
[18:33] Have you seen how decent boys behave.
[18:39] Hey, nowadays, where do you
get such decent boys from?
[18:45] Asma is really lucky.
[18:48] But mama, when are we taking the proposal?
[18:50] We should have a new suit,
we should go with preparation.
[18:53] What preparation do you have to make?
You always think about ways to spend money.
[18:57] I plan for going to Umrah right after marriage.
[19:00] Oh hello everyone,
[19:02] why is everyone sitting together over here?
[19:04] We are thinking of ways to drag you out.
[19:08] My dear mama,
you don’t have to put in so much effort.
[19:12] I have already decided that
I will spend my life with you.
[19:18] I have to give a good news to all of you.
[19:21] God be kind.
[19:23] My niece Honey is coming from America.
All of you will be really happy to meet her.
[19:30] Hey, how much happiness
will we face like this?
[19:33] I am getting her bedroom set,
so I am really busy.
[19:36] Sorry Anila, I cannot give you time.
[19:39] She doesn’t need your time anyway, okay?
Go do your work.
[19:43] Okay dear mama.
[19:45] Seema, call Mahir,
[19:48] and tell him that aunt Sweetie is calling him quickly,
he should come immediately.
[19:52] Then he will surely come.
[19:54] Well if he doesn’t come,
then I will go pick him myself.
[19:58] Very good,
[19:59] so that means that he will not even be
able to breath peacefully there either.
[20:04] You are so funny.
[20:11] Call him. Call him. Call Mahir.
[20:14] Voice call, Mahir.
[20:18] Wow.
[20:20] Yes?
[20:23] Yes, it is me.
[20:25] Greetings. Greetings.
Listen, you come here immediately.
[20:30] It is something important, you come here.
Whatever you are dressed in, come in it.
[20:34] I am in an emergency, that’s it.
Come on, right now. Here, cut it.
[20:40] The discussion of my proposal
is stuck in the middle brother.
[20:43] Brother such an important
matter is being discussed here,
[20:46] you are bringing your proposal in the middle.
[20:48] This is a one way traffic right now,
you please wait right now.
[20:53] Hey,
[20:56] why are you packing your bags?
I should have gone.
[20:59] His grandma called,
there has been an emergency, he has to leave.
[21:02] Okay this is good.
[21:04] I wanted to introduce you two to
my uncle and aunty, they are the sweetest.
[21:08] And Mahir if you want any help in future,
if you want something done, do tell me.
[21:16] I will be willing to help you.
[21:18] Thank you so much Honey,
you are really sweet.
[21:20] You too are really sweet.
[21:21] I will call uncle and aunty.
[21:23] Uncle, aunty, come in. Come.
[21:26] What are you doing? Keep your shirt straight.
[21:29] Uncle, aunty, this is my cousin Salik.
[21:35] Greetings uncle.
Hello son, how are you?
[21:38] And this is Salik’s friend, this poor thing…
[21:43] You? Mahir. What are you doing here?
[21:46] Dad.
[21:48] You know Mahir?
[21:50] Yes, he is our son.
Dabeer, did you not tell Honey?
[21:55] Honey never asked.
[21:56] Honey, how do you know him?
[22:00] This means you are Mahir’s step mom?
[22:04] Yes.
[22:11] Mama Seema was telling me,
[22:13] Saman called, they are asking for
the wedding date. What do you say?
[22:18] I say that our issues are not resolved
and they are asking for the wedding date.
[22:22] I am telling you clearly,
till the time my son doesn’t come back,
[22:26] till my Mahir doesn’t come back,
I don’t give permission for any marriage.
[22:29] Mama, this is something that won’t happen,
you know how stubborn he is.
[22:34] So he won’t come and then
the wedding won’t take place ever.
[22:38] Say something nice for a change.
[22:40] The idiom is correct that if you look beautiful,
then you say good things too.
[22:46] Grandma.
[22:47] Grandma. Greetings. Greetings uncle.
How are you grandma? I have come.
[22:52] Oh my prince, live long, live long.
I knew you would come. Are you fine my love?
[22:57] Grandma you called me
suddenly is everything fine?
[22:59] This girl, child, you come on.
[23:01] Come on. Have a seat.
Consider it your own home. Come. Come.
[23:09] Hello.
[23:11] This is Honey,
[23:12] my niece, but just like my daughter.
[23:15] My life, my princess.
[23:17] Is she your daughter, Sweetie?
The one from America?
[23:20] Yes.
[23:21] Then what was she doing at Salik’s home?
[23:24] Salik is her uncle’s son.
[23:26] She said she first wants to meet her uncle,
then she will come stay here.
[23:30] Coincidentally she met Mahir there,
the two of them became friends.
[23:34] And now they have become best friends.
[23:37] Back then I didn’t know that
Honey is aunt Sweetie’s adopted daughter.
[23:41] Mahir, let the past be, let it go.
I am happy that you two have come home.
[23:46] A new twist in the story.
[23:48] So much spice.
I will go call Mona, why is she missing it.
[23:54] Grandma, you tell me,
[23:55] you called me suddenly I got scared.
Is everything fine?
[23:58] Everything is fine, I will tell you later.
[24:01] Right now you go and rest in your room.
[24:03] Come on, go.
[24:06] I too want to rest.
You people show me my room.
[24:11] Hey, what is the need to rest right now?
[24:13] You are acting like you have walked
all the way from America to here.
[24:16] Sit next to mama, talk to her,
take her prayers.
[24:20] God knows if you will get
the chance again or not.
[24:22] Yes, what else?
[24:24] Mama has to curse her, right mama?
[24:27] I cannot face anyone.
I am really embarrassed.
[24:31] Be quiet.
[24:40] Yes, Rania.
[24:41] How are you?
[24:43] You called after so long.
[24:45] Yes, tell me, did Mahir come home?
[24:47] I called Salik to find out how he is,
so he said…
[24:50] Yes, yes, he has come back home
and you know who he came back with?
[24:53] Sweetie aunt’s adopted daughter
who is her niece, he came back with her.
[24:57] Huh?
[24:58] Where did Mahir find this little witch.
[25:01] This is the fun thing,
she is brother Salik’s uncle’s daughter.
[25:05] And she was living in their home
[25:07] and brother Mahir and
she has really good understanding.
[25:10] It is so funny, he has a fight with mama
and he is friends with the daughter.
[25:14] I feel that there will be a really dangerous
environment at home for a few days.
[25:19] So that Honey,
she is aunt Sweetie’s daughter.
[25:24] That’s why!
[25:25] That’s why I didn’t like her at the first look.
[25:27] My heart bore witness that
this girl is really cunning and sharp.
[25:32] Really?
[25:33] That’s how you felt?
But when did you meet her?
[25:37] Leave that.
[25:38] Rabail, you have to save Mahir
from that Honey. Understand?
[25:44] Me?
[25:45] How can I protect him and if brother Mahir likes
that girl, then I cannot change his opinion.
[25:52] So then you are useless, Rabail.
[25:55] Rania listen to me. Hello?
[25:59] How do I save brother Mahir?
[26:12] Hey Honey, this is good that you became friends
with Mahir as soon as you came to Pakistan.
[26:17] I am so happy. I am so happy. Oh God.
[26:20] and you have no idea how embarrassed I am.
How will I face Mahir now?
[26:24] You are mad,
what is there to be embarrassed in this?
[26:28] What have you not done with him?
Do you have any idea?
[26:31] Oh that’s the thing.
[26:33] You don’t worry.
[26:34] You go and give him the good news that
I have given up the idea of taking his entire property.
[26:41] How can you take his property?
[26:44] Don’t challenge Sweetie,
she can get everything done.
[26:48] Right now, go and give him the good news
that I have given up on the idea.
[26:52] Go, he will get happy.
[26:54] I am not going anywhere,
nor will I become part of any politics.
[26:58] What is going on, Mona? Huh?
[27:01] This Sweetie’s daughter and
she is Mahir’s friend, what is going on?
[27:05] Hey, what would we know?
[27:07] We are plain and simple people.
[27:09] How will we understand
the politics of these foreigners?
[27:13] No, you are wrong.
[27:15] Along with foreigners,
I feel internal people are also involved.
[27:19] I am telling you, this Mahir is really sharp,
he is going to make a big move.
[27:23] I have always said he is really smart.
[27:26] Hey, so he can be, what can we do?
he can be anything.
[27:29] Khaver is really plain and simple,
you talk a little loudly he gets scared.
[27:34] He says he will always be my slave.
[27:36] Hey he cannot control,
[27:38] if he gets the date,
he will come tomorrow with his family.
[27:41] I hope mama calls him soon.
[27:44] We will call them. We will call them.
We will call everyone.
[27:47] Now not one but two marriages
will take place in this home.
[27:51] Sister in law, who is the second marriage for?
Who is marrying whom?
[27:54] This is an open surprise.
The boy is at home and so is the girl.
[28:00] It will be so much fun that
the whole world will see.
[28:06] Oh, I am dead.
[28:08] Mona, I feel all hell going to break
loose in this home, a big earthquake.
[28:12] I will go an inform Hammad that
he should stop it if possible.
[28:16] Yes, mama on one side
and Sweetie on the other.
[28:20] Oh, God knows what will happen.
Hammad.
[28:23] Hey there is nothing like that.
Hammad listen to me.
[28:25] I will tell you, listen to me.
[28:28] Listen. What if my wedding is left
because of these people.
[28:31] No. Khaver. Love.
[28:41] Whatever aunt Sweetie did with you,
I am embarrassed and I apologize.
[28:49] I promise you that I will not let
anything wrong happen with you in future.
[28:53] Thank you Honey.
[28:54] Brother.
[28:55] Brother, what are you doing?
[28:57] What game are you playing,
will you tell me too?
[28:59] Game.
[29:00] What game Rabail?
[29:02] You are marrying the adopted
daughter of your cunning stepmother?
[29:06] What is wrong with you?
Save yourself. You will get ruined.
[29:10] Both those mother and daughter will…
[29:14] Drive you mad?
[29:16] Is this what you want to say?
[29:19] Yes, I want to say that.
[29:26] And if I say I am not like aunt Sweetie?
[29:29] Will you believe me?
[29:33] Okay then I will prove it to you
that I am not like aunt Sweetie.
[29:37] And I will support Mahir completely.
[29:39] .
[29:39] I promise.
[29:42] Thank you Honey,
[29:44] but I don’t want anyone’s help or support.
[29:49] I will fight my own battle, I will win it.
[30:41] Farhad!
[30:43] You call me your sister,
[30:45] but so much happened,
[30:47] all hell broke loose,
and you didn’t even bother informing me.
[30:49] All hell broke loose?
[30:51] No hell broke loose,
we are living hell, madam.
[30:54] By the way you are no less than a storm?
What happened? Why are you so angry?
[30:58] That…cunning girl,
she is uncle Dabeer’s adopted daughter.
[31:02] Cunning…cunning girl? What cunning girl?
Why do you taunt someone with wrong names?
[31:08] Oh my God.
[31:10] She has taken over your thoughts too?
[31:13] She is a really cunning girl.
She is really smart.
[31:17] By the way, tell me,
what is your issue with her?
[31:22] I have no personal issue with her,
I am worried for mama.
[31:26] This mother and daughter
want to ruin the customs of the home.
[31:31] You tell me, your uptight neighbours,
what is their opinion about her?
[31:37] I have heard they have become good friends.
[31:39] By the way, I don’t understand, why do you
men become so stupid in these moments?
[31:43] These women like Honey and aunty Sweetie
will sell you and you wont even know.
[31:48] You will see, you will see,
Mahir will be treated badly, I am telling you.
[31:53] Really?
[31:56] When did you get the power
to see the unforeseen?
[32:01] Look, I have been trying to make her
understand that she is an innocent girl,
[32:05] don’t curse her, but she doesn’t agree.
[32:11] I feel she dislikes Honey a lot.
[32:14] and I feel you have a special
attachment with Honey.
[32:18] You know, she is pretty. Ask Mahir.
[32:22] Yes, do you men ever find a girl to be bad?
[32:25] You know, listen to me,
[32:27] us men don’t like smart girls and
we find the ones with big dreams the worst.
[32:32] I swear. These stupid girls are really cute.
[32:36] Right, Mahir?
[32:38] Yes, but Rania is not cute at all.
[32:41] No.
[32:42] I am not stupid either.
[32:45] and boys don’t even like smart girls,
so are you not smart either?
[32:51] I will break your head.
[32:53] Okay man, why are you getting angry?
Anger doesn’t suit you.
[32:57] You look like a small squirrel when angry.
[32:59] Yes, you are right. this was true.
[33:01] Yes, today you seem really happy.
I feel you got a big happiness.
[33:07] Oh, I wish I could get it.
[33:11] Right now there are no chances for a long time.
[33:14] And the damned person,
[33:19] from whom I will get happiness
cannot take a hint.
[33:21] It is really disappointing,
[33:23] you should have at least cared for mama.
[33:26] Remember, relations are
more important than wealth.
[33:31] I have understood this well Rania,
[33:33] but sadly I understood it late.
[33:37] I am not joking, I am serious.
[33:39] Even I am serious.
