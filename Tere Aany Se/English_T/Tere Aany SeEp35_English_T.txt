[00:23] Brother, Shahanshah is telling me
Rania is here.
[00:26] Yes, she is here.
[00:28] But she came to Farhad’s home,
[00:30] and not to meet us.
[00:31] So you should have invited her home,
why didn’t you call her?
[00:34] Rabail, after all that she has faced,
[00:36] after that how do I call her to our home?
[00:38] mama is calling her, come with me,
lets get her. One second.
[00:42] First let me deal with my dad’s wife.
[00:45] Let me tell her that
[00:46] her scheming won’t work on me.
[00:48] Brother,
[00:49] we will tell her later,
right now let’s please meet Rania.
[00:52] Come on. Come quickly.
Come on. Man. Come on, come.
[00:57] You know sister Rania,
[00:59] uncle sings in his sleep at night
[01:01] and he dances around while walking.
[01:03] When you ask him, he says that
[01:05] I am practicing to dance on my wedding.
[01:07] The grooms nowadays dance on
their own wedding,
[01:10] so I too am practicing the same.
[01:13] I am preparing daily,
[01:14] I am practicing daily.
[01:17] I have a doubt in my heart,
[01:19] that what if your rich father converts this
happy occasion into a sad one.
[01:26] Don’t worry about him,
[01:27] sing happily.
[01:30] Only people
with good fate get this opportunity.
[01:33] Because not everyone has happiness in their fate.
[01:37] Rania!
[01:41] Rabail.
[01:42] How are you? I am fine, how are you?
how is everyone at home?
[01:46] Everyone is fine.  Sit.
[01:49] Yes, yes,
[01:51] she is really worried about home.
[01:53] I met her a while back,
[01:56] she didn’t even bother asking me,
that you are unwell,
[01:58] how are you feeling now?
[02:00] Hah,
[02:01] the ones who don’t care about themselves,
what should one ask them?
[02:04] And since that Honey came,
he came following her.
[02:10] and when mama went to call him,
[02:11] he clearly refused
[02:13] remove this misunderstanding from your heart.
[02:16] I am still doing all this because of mama.
[02:19] Grandma had told me that
I have to attend uncle and Bebo’s marriage from home.
[02:23] So then,
[02:24] why didn’t you come to our home?
[02:28] Did you wait for me?
[02:31] Mian Jee was getting upset,
[02:33] he was saying he is such a fool he
didn’t even come to greet me.
[02:36] When you came to our home,
we served you so much,.
[02:39] You remember, right?
Yes, I remember everything.
[02:42] You know
I have done something like a donkey,
[02:44] I will come.
[02:46] and yes,
[02:47] you had to discuss something related to
business with my papa.
[02:50] Have you forgotten?
[02:51] Or did you change your mind?
[02:52] No, no, why would I change my mind?
[02:54] In fact, I am even more adamant now.
[02:56] I have understood that
[02:58] if I stay homeless, useless like this,
[03:02] then what father would give me his daughter?
[03:04] So I will come really soon.
[03:07] Oh, okay.
[03:10] So this is the deal.
[03:11] All this is for a girl.
[03:16] You got that right.
[03:17] I am doing it for a girl.
[03:20] Tell me, when should I come?
[03:22] He is not that idle,
[03:24] he is a big businessman.
Go and take advice from someone else.
[03:27] Hey, hey, hey, her attitude changed since
she found a rich father.
[03:31] Listen madam,
[03:32] your father is not the only rich man in this city,
[03:34] there are several rich people ready to
give advice at any time.
[03:38] And you know Rania,
that honey is better than you.
[03:47] One second,
[03:50] where did the mention
of Honey come from?
[03:52] What is in the heart comes on the tongue.
[03:55] Let him mention Honey.
[03:57] Tell me more,
[03:58] what other qualities does your Honey have?
[04:00] What? What do I tell you?
[04:01] At least she is a million times better than you.
[04:04] She understands
what the other person says,
[04:06] she cares for the feelings of the other person,
you are…
[04:09] Since when did you start liking these things?
Hey,
[04:12] his thoughts have changed.
[04:15] It feels like Honey
has been a blessing in your life.
[04:19] Quiet. Quiet.
[04:22] Excuse me.
[04:23] You people have gathered here
to talk about my marriage.
[04:26] I mean, you are not talking about my marriage
[04:27] and you are talking about your family,
[04:29] you go
and have this discussion in your own home.
[04:31] What is going on?
[04:32] Uncle, I have told you not to worry.
[04:35] I am true to what I say.
[04:36] When I said that this proposal will be fixed,
then it will be fixed.
[04:39] Hey, how will it happen?
How will it happen?
[04:41] We will think about it.
[04:43] I will leave now. Rania,
[04:45] mama is restless to meet you,
this is why I came to call you.
[04:48] What?
[04:49] Sister Rania,
[04:50] you came after so long and
you are going so soon.
[04:53] You still haven’t even met mama.
[04:55] Wait for some time, she must be coming,
meet her and then go.
[04:58] Leave it child,
[05:01] now sister Rania is not the same sister Rania.
[05:03] She is now the daughter of a rich father,
[05:06] when will she meet anyone?
[05:07] Let her go.
[05:10] Laiba, I will go greet mama.
[05:13] When I come back, aunty will be home too,
then I will meet her as well.
[05:16] Rania, what will happen to me, then?
[05:19] Uncle, right now the situation is bad,
[05:22] we cannot talk about good things even
if we want to.
[05:25] Your time will come, okay?
[05:27] Come on Rabail. Come.
[05:29] Hey, damn it. Come, we will do the dance practice.
Come on, let’s not waste time.
[05:37] What was the need for to mess things up?
[05:39] Now suffer. You have ruined it all.
[05:41] I am suffering,
what else am I doing?
[05:47] Look at him.
[05:49] Leave him, listen to me.
[05:52] Tell me something, how do you find Rania?
[05:58] What do you mean how do I find him?
[05:59] Hey she is ill-mannered,
short tempered and she has tantrums.
[06:05] She doesn’t understand anyone’s feelings.
[06:09] I got it. I got it.
[06:16] Come on, we will dance. Hey, come on,
don’t be shy. Come on.
[06:20] I don’t want to do it. Uncle, I don’t want to…
[06:23] Hey, this step.
This is the step son. This. This.
[06:32] Why is everyone from that
home so short tempered?
[06:36] Hey, at least you come. Come here.
[06:42] Oh, Honey, what have you done to yourself?
[06:45] Be dressed up, do a little makeup
[06:49] Aunty, I always stay like this. Simple
[06:52] Okay, to hell with it.
[06:53] Just follow what I tell you to do.
You?
[07:00] How dare you come here?
[07:02] Your father took you with a lot of pride from here.
Why have you come here, now?
[07:07] I didn’t come to meet you,
and nor do I want to talk to you.
[07:10] Listen,
[07:11] even I am not interested in talking to you,
[07:14] but right now, you are standing in my home,
so it is necessary for me to ask you.
[07:18] Not at all,
[07:19] this is my mama’s home,
[07:20] she is the real owner of this home
[07:22] and I don’t like arguing with
people who make claims for no reason
[07:25] and nor do I have time.
[07:26] Come on, Rabail. One minute.
[07:28] How are you talking to my aunty?
[07:30] Just like your aunty is talking.
[07:32] You are your aunt’s sympathizer.
[07:34] You take her side.
You are a drama just like your aunt.
[07:37] Shut up.
[07:38] Don’t get your face broken by me.
[07:40] What do you think? I have come from America
so I cannot fight the local way?
[07:44] I will insult you so badly that
[07:46] you will have steam coming from your ears and
tears from your eyes. Understand?
[07:50] I think your bad days are near.
[07:52] It is time for you to pack your bags.
[07:55] I understand your cunningness really well.
[07:59] Mahir was not home for so long,
[08:01] you didn’t even bother peeking here.
[08:02] Now Mahir is here, so you came after him.
[08:05] What do you think?
[08:06] You will have Mahir following you
after your father’s wealth?
[08:09] You will not get anything,
I wont let this happen.
[08:13] Mahir will get married where he wants.
Understand?
[08:17] Stop this nonsense.
[08:19] What are you saying?
[08:20] Hey she came to this home after so long,
[08:22] how are you talking to her?
[08:25] This girl is standing in my home and
misbehaving with me.
[08:28] Her father got some money,
and she has forgotten to respect you and old.
[08:32] Uncle, aunty is absolutely right,
this girl’s behavior is not right with aunty at all.
[08:37] Honey you don’t interfere,
[08:38] you don’t know anything.
[08:40] Come,
[08:41] you come to my room.
[08:42] She has a mental issue. Rabail child,
[08:45] inform Seema and Mona too,
[08:47] my child has come after so long.
[08:49] We will have some fun.
Come on. Come on. Come.
[09:04] This girl is so shameless,
she came to this home again.
[09:08] Aunty,
[09:09] what is the issue you have with this girl?
Tell me something.
[09:12] Oh Honey darling, you are really innocent,
you don’t know.
[09:15] This girl is after Mahir.
[09:18] Anyway, I have decided,
[09:20] I wont let them become one.
[09:24] Aunty.
[09:25] Aunty, listen to me. Honey,
[09:28] you want to know what issue aunty
and Rania have?
[09:33] I will tell you child all that
aunty has done with Rania.
[09:42] Where are you?
[09:43] Yes, yes, I am standing outside,
you please come quickly.
[09:46] Fine. Okay, come quickly.
[09:50] Are you going home?
[09:53] Yes, the driver is on his way.
[09:56] Rania, I am really embarrassed.
[10:00] Whatever aunty did with you
was extremely wrong.
[10:07] Whatever she did was her own doing,
[10:11] now because of that I cannot stay away
from such loving relations, just,
[10:14] that’s why I came today.
[10:16] You did good
[10:19] because the ones who hide at home are guilty
[10:21] and don’t you worry,
[10:22] I have made aunty understand.
[10:24] She will not misbehave from now onwards.
[10:28] Are you going back? So soon?
[10:34] Yes, I had to go back.
[10:37] And not soon, I am going after a lot of hours.
[10:39] The driver must be on his way.
[10:41] What is the need for a driver?
[10:43] This bike is here, I will drop you.
[10:45] No. There is no need for that.
[10:48] The driver must be coming.
[10:50] Obviously,
[10:53] now when will you like my bike.
[10:58] It is not that,
[10:59] it wont seem reasonable going
with you like this.
[11:05] You don’t have this thought going
with Wasiq.
[11:09] Don’t say something wrong.
[11:10] I have never sat with Dr. Wasiq on a bike.
[11:13] He doesn’t even have a bike.
[11:15] So what do you have a problem with?
[11:17] My bike or me?
[11:20] Both.
[11:25] I understand well.
[11:26] Your style and actions are changing,
I am noticing it.
[11:30] Yes, you are right.
[11:33] what is in the heart is evident from
the eyes and face.
[11:36] end I understand everything.
[11:39] But you too remember one thing,
[11:41] those selfish in relations are always left alone.
[11:45] When have I been selfish, Rania?
[11:49] My car is here.
[11:51] Goodbye.
[12:12] She has left.
[12:14] Now you too come back
[12:16] and tell me what the deal is.
[12:19] There is no deal.
[12:20] There is something.
[12:24] She is just the daughter of a rich father,
it is just this.
[12:29] Mahir.
[12:31] Mahir, listen…
[12:56] Didn’t you take too long to come.
[12:59] Yes,
[13:01] I went after a long time,
so everyone gathered,
[13:04] I didn’t know how time passed.
[13:06] if they could they wouldn’t have let me come,
still.
[13:08] Then you should have stayed there today.
[13:14] I mean, that…
[13:17] you used to live there earlier too.
[13:19] It was different earlier,
[13:21] now I have a home in this same city.
[13:25] That’s it
or do you want to ask anything more?
[13:27] No, I was just asking you. Give me way.
[13:44] Oh, they are here. Those people are here.
[13:47] They are not here yet, don’t scream so much.
[13:49] Take care of her.  Yes.
[13:54] Mama, you get off. You get off.
I am opening the door.
[13:59] Such a high car, oh God.
[14:05] Thank you brother. Thank you.
[14:08] Come on. Come on. How are you?
Thank God. Come on. Hey,
[14:13] you are in a hurry to go in.
[14:15] Me? Hurry?
[14:17] Hey, I didn’t want to come.
[14:18] I came only cause of you people.
[14:20] If you want, we will go back. Hey no,
[14:22] you have come here,
now if you leave it will look like stupidity
[14:24] and you don’t seem this stupid to me.
[14:35] Come now. Come on.
[14:48] Oh.  Hey…
[14:53] Are you fine?
[14:54] Yes. Are you okay?
[14:58] The reason for me to come here is complete.
[15:01] What do you mean?
I don’t understand.
[15:03] Meaning, we might have brought another proposal to this home
or is it just what I think.
[15:09] mama, greetings.
[15:11] Live long. Live long, my love.
[15:14] She too is here. Huh? How is my child?
[15:18] How are you? Thank God. Thank God.
[15:20] Now I have come here today
with the proposal of the most decent man in this city.
[15:29] Yes. Today it feels like you are the boy’s family.
I swear.
[15:33] You look good.
[15:36] Yes, think that I am from the boy’s side.
[15:40] And I will see how you
say no to your elder sister.
[15:44] Sister, you brought a decent man,
but our girl is such that you wont find another one, she is such.
[15:52] Listen, one is enough for me,
[15:56] why would I look for another one?
[15:59] Okay, thank God for that too. Wow. Wow.
such a great environment.
[16:04] Love is all around.
[16:07] Do you want to fix the proposal standing here?
I mean don’t you want to come inside?
[16:10] Do you have time?
The people in the city don’t have time.
[16:14] We got free time for you.
come on. Come. Come. Come.
[16:17] Come on. Come on. Come. Come.
Thank God. Come on.
[16:22] By the way,
[16:24] I feel that really soon just like uncle Ayaz,
I too have to come to this home.
[16:29] There is a big difference
between you and uncle Ayaz.
[16:32] What if this happens that
your father says to me
[16:37] take my daughter’s proposal and
let me thank you.
[16:42] Today you are our guest,
[16:44] so you can be as stupid as you want.
[16:46] We wont say anything,
[16:48] or else we know how to shut you up.
[16:59] I am the elder son,
[17:01] it was right for me to go with mama,
[17:04] but because of your actions,
[17:06] I am unable to face anyone.
[17:08] Dabeer,
[17:10] what will you do showing the world this face?
[17:13] Seeing this face of yours the world can be sad,
[17:16] they can be worried,
but they can never be happy.
[17:19] Will you please shut up?
[17:25] I don’t know what must be going on there?
[17:27] What must be going on? Huh?
[17:29] What must be going on? Everyone must be eating
or the proposal must be getting fixed, that’s it.
[17:35] Dabeer,
[17:37] I have noted something.
[17:39] Since you have come to Pakistan,
[17:41] you have stopped enjoying my company.
[17:46] Listen,
[17:47] do you have an affair
with someone coming here?
[17:53] It is useless to talk to you.
[17:55] Yes, then don’t talk to me,
[17:58] you only listen to me.
[18:01] By the way, I am thinking that
[18:02] now we should fix Honey
and Mahir’s proposal.
[18:07] What do you say?
[18:10] Are you in your senses?
[18:12] Mahir and Honey’s proposal?
[18:14] There is no fault in my mind.
[18:16] What does Honey lack?
[18:18] She is American. She is American.
She is American.
[18:22] She is. She is. When am I saying she isn’t?
[18:24] Hey, the fault is not in Honey,
[18:26] it is in you, you are her aunt.
[18:29] No one will accept
this matchless relation in our family.
[18:34] And Mahir?
[18:35] He will not agree at all.
[18:37] What if he leaves the home and goes again.
Mad woman!
[18:41] Dabeer,
[18:42] I am not saying this for my own benefit,
[18:45] it has your benefit and your family’s benefit.
[18:48] Look, if Honey and Mahir get married,
then Mahir will come to America with you,
[18:54] he will work in the store with you.
[18:56] Whatever we own will be theirs and
whatever is theirs will be ours.
[19:06] I am not half minded like you that
[19:10] I sit at home all day and make up stories.
[19:14] They must be having fun there
[19:16] and I am sitting here
with this sister of Sheikh Chili and hearing stories.
[19:21] Did Sheikh Chili have a sister?
[19:23] There was.
Her husband choked her to death.
[19:33] Hey, nothing will happen,
why are you scared? Calm down.
[19:37] I am not scared.  My papa is really good.
[19:42] Greetings.
[19:44] Absolutely fine Absolutely fine
[19:46] Greetings.
[19:47] Live long. Live long. Zaman, live long.
[20:03] I apologize you people had to wait.
[20:06] I got an important call
so I was busy on the phone.
[20:10] Aunt, are you fine?
[20:12] Thank God. He is great.
[20:15] Rania child, what use is this juice?
[20:17] Get snacks and breakfast served.
[20:20] Yes, I will just get it served.
[20:22] Child, we will have breakfast and also have tea.
If you ask us, we will also have food.
[20:28] But the question we have come with to you,
[20:31] you just answer it with a yes.
[20:35] Zaman son,
[20:37] we have seen the boy,
[20:38] we have done our verification too,
now you just answer.
[20:43] Yes, son.
[20:44] His eyes, ears and teeth everything is fine,
thank God.
[20:51] So do you do a job or your own business?
[20:56] Yes, job. Job. I do a job.
[21:00] and if you don’t mind,
can I ask you how much is your salary?
[21:04] If you are okay telling me.
[21:07] Brother, I think that if husband and
wife have good understanding then
[21:14] if you lack money it doesn’t matter.
[21:18] Even I. I think the same thing.
[21:23] Yes, yes uncle,
[21:25] I agree with this.
[21:27] Now see,
[21:28] money is something nor worth trusting,
[21:29] today I have it tomorrow someone else will have it.
[21:42] There is no news till now.
[21:44] I feel uncle Zaman is taking a tough interview.
If he says no, then?
[21:49] Hey even I am worried. If the boy is like Ayaz,
then anyone can say no.
[21:55] Hey, what nonsense are you
people talking about?
[21:58] the news I am going to give you after that
your hearts will stop beating,
[22:03] so hold on to your heart.
[22:06] Oh God, they said no?
[22:08] I had said they would say no.
Oh God. What will happen now?
[22:12] I feel that before my marriage
uncle Ayaz will return to God.
[22:15] Oh, I am not talking about him
[22:17] Then who are you talking about?
[22:20] Say it clearly,
don’t create suspense like your sister.
[22:26] Brother Dabeer and sister in law Sweetie
[22:28] have together fixed
Honey’s marriage with Mahir.
[22:33] What?
[22:34] Yes
[22:40] Hey madam,
[22:42] why are you taking out the sweets?
[22:44] Has the proposal been finalized.
[22:46] It hasn’t been fixed yet,
but it will surely get fixed.
[22:50] Rania.
[22:51] Hey, Rania.
[22:52] Come quickly.
[22:53] Go control your dad,
[22:55] he is asking weird questions.
[22:57] He is asking about the salary,
[22:59] now in a while,
he will start asking about the property.
[23:01] Are these questions to ask from a boy’s family.
[23:04] I am worried about myself.
[23:05] Come on, man. Come. Come quickly.
[23:07] Oh God, this papa is too much.
[23:09] Listen, you prepare the tea.
[23:11] In fact, first go put these
sweets on the dining table. Okay?
[23:14] Fine, I will just do it.
I will go check on papa.
[23:19] You didn’t answer my question…Ayaz.
[23:26] Yes, sir, sir,
actually my salary is fifty thousand rupees.
[23:31] Since the dollar rate has increased,
they are waiting for it to come down,
[23:36] so the salary will also increase.
I will have an increment
[23:39] and also a promotion.
[23:40] Sir, they have also promised a car,
[23:43] by the way the head of the company is sister.
[23:45] That’s why. Yes, yes, yes,
[23:47] the company has given us a home,
[23:49] it is a really big home.
[23:51] And me and brother,
together the two of us are running the home,
[23:55] and we don’t lack anything.
[23:57] Believe me,
[23:59] Asma will not have any complaints.
[24:10] I think all the questions are done,
lets have sweets.
[24:14] Yes. I will just get sweets. Child, wait.
[24:22] These are matters of elders,
[24:23] children shouldn’t interfere.
[24:26] After all this marriage is a serious matter.
[24:30] Anyway,
[24:31] you are our respectable guests
[24:33] and one daughter of our is coming
to your home as your daughter in law,
[24:37] so we have a relation.
[24:39] So please not just tea,
eat something and go.
[24:44] Yes, brother,
[24:47] then what hope should we have?
[24:51] You don’t make such decisions so easily.
[25:00] I will think and
let you know in a few days.
[25:21] Mona, listen to me.
[25:23] This is not the time for useless jokes. Go.
[25:26] Go inside and do your work.
[25:28] The two of us are in a lot of tension
[25:30] and waiting for an important phone call,
don’t disturb us.
[25:33] Come on. Come on.
[25:34] Go. Go and call Khaver,
he will hear this nonsense from you and he wont even mind.
[25:38] Oh, hey I have spoken to him
[25:41] and I am really not joking.
[25:43] I have heard with
my own beautiful ears brother Dabeer
[25:47] and sister in law Sweetie talking,
[25:49] they are really serious.
You don’t believe me, right?
[25:51] You don’t believe me either?
Come with me.
[25:53] Come with me and ask them yourself.
[26:04] Mian Jee.
[26:05] Mian Jee.
[26:06] Yes?
[26:07] Papa is not treating my uncle Ayaz well.
[26:11] He is so disappointed.
[26:16] If he gets a heart attack out of tension,
then we will be responsible for his death
[26:21] and you are the girl’s father Mian Jee,
so use your right.
[26:27] Zaman, son,
[26:29] you can take as much time as you want.
[26:33] But remember the decision must be in our favour.
[26:38] I will not hear no for an answer.
[26:40] Yes. Yes. Yes. I was going to say this.
[26:43] Yes, yes, this will be really good.
[26:53] The guests are smiling,
[26:55] this means they are going to put the sweets
[26:58] and they were just waiting for me.
[27:06] Greetings. Greetings.
[28:01] Do you see?
[28:02] Your dad has made everyone sad.
He is really cruel.
[28:08] Leave my dad
[28:10] and focus on your character,
that would be better.
[28:12] Listen,
[28:14] if you can focus a little on my character,
wont it be a little better?
[28:19] I don’t care what is good for you
and what not.
[28:23] Think about it, if I stop caring for you,
you will regret it.
[28:29] I have not been fooled by anyone earlier,
[28:32] nor will I be fooled by anyone now. Okay?
[28:34] Go and sit down.
[28:36] Your neck is stiff cause of pride,
your neck too will get stiff,
[28:40] go and sit.
[28:43] Why did you come?
[28:45] I feel he is standing in your respect.
[28:47] Go and sit
or else he will be left hanging like this.
[28:58] Listen,
[29:01] till your brother doesn’t stay yes,
[29:04] we wont give up.
[29:05] We will keep on visiting.
[29:07] Don’t worry.
[29:15] Oh my…Oh I am dead.
[29:19] Such a big conspiracy.
[29:21] I don’t believe this, this Sweetie thinks
she will take over our Mahir.
[29:25] Never. I am telling you,
I wont let this happen.
[29:29] That’s it you let it be.
[29:30] You cannot control brother.
[29:33] Have you seen sister in law Sweetie,
[29:34] whatever she wants,
whatever she puts her hand on, she gets it.
[29:38] Yes, you are right but not now.
[29:40] Understand? Now she wont be successful.
[29:43] Now I wont do anything. I will go straight to mama and
reveal this dangerous conspiracy in front of her.
[29:48] Then mama will do everything.
[29:50] You know your sister
has a hard time keeping secrets.
[29:54] Could you not have kept quiet?
What was the need to tell her?
[29:57] You have started a new story.
[29:59] Did you people notice another thing?
[30:02] Mahir and Honey,
[30:04] both are going around together.
[30:05] I think the setting is final between them.
[30:08] You are right, even I have noted it.
[30:10] She is always stuck like a chewing gum,
she is always doing this,
[30:13] she is going around him.
[30:14] And even at the time of the proposal
she reached with us to Rania’s.
[30:19] I feel something is fishy.
They have set a trap to catch Mahir.
[30:28] I don’t like this Honey.
[30:30] I don’t like her at all. I am telling you,
[30:33] if these two get married
I will have to participate cause of you,
[30:37] but I wont give any envelope or gift,
I have told you already.
[30:41] Hey, you people don’t worry,
don’t worry at all. When the time comes,
[30:45] I will tell mama everything to mama myself.
[30:49] Promise. No.
[30:51] Oh God. You have given your word.
[30:59] Mama,
[31:00] Asma is not answering the phone.
[31:02] I feel something is fishy.
[31:04] What if Asma has gone against her brother’s decision
[31:08] and brother snatched her phone out of anger.
[31:10] What if,
[31:12] her brother has her behind a wall
or locked her in a room
[31:16] and in anger he has said that
[31:19] if you step out of the home to meet Ayaz,
then I will break your legs.
[31:22] Hey, why is this damned brother
of his acting like a wall between us? Why?
[31:27] Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Ayaz,
[31:29] what are you thinking?
[31:31] Sister I feel that I will die single.
[31:34] Hey I came to the world,
so that I attend the reception of people?
[31:37] What else did I say apart from this?
[31:38] Ayaz,
[31:39] the same nonsense again.
[31:41] I am really angry. Be quiet. Be quiet.
[31:44] Sister, my expiry date is passing,
and you are asking me to be quiet…Be patient.
[31:47] I be patient? The fruit of patience is sweet.
[31:49] You said the same things to your husband,
[31:52] hey that innocent man went mad.
[31:54] He went mad. he came home well,
[31:57] he went mad and got admitted in the mental asylum.
[31:59] I meet the doctor every month,
the doctor tells me to take him, he is not mad.
[32:02] I meet brother,
[32:03] he says that your sister is mad,
[32:05] get out of here.
[32:06] You will drive me mad.
You want that I go to the mental asylum.
[32:09] When will you come and meet me? Quiet.
[32:11] Quiet. This is my personal matter.
[32:13] This is not personal. It is not personal.
[32:15] The whole family knows.
[32:17] You fed a good man, potatoes and curry,
[32:21] and not even curry it has water in it.
You fed it to him,
[32:24] and drove him mad, sister.
[32:26] You are getting young yourself,
[32:28] getting injections and you have made that
man a psycho.
[32:32] Ayaz, too much. Too much.
[32:37] Sister,
[32:38] make a call. Who knows,
maybe he really blocked my phone.
[32:42] Don’t touch my phone. Don’t touch my phone.
I will hit you in the head with the phone.
[32:47] This is what you did with brother.
[32:48] You burned him with an iron. An iron!
[32:54] Uncle, Zaman had breakfast early and went.
[32:57] and Bebo is not here yet. Is she fine?
[33:00] She says she doesn’t feel like it.
[33:03] Huh? Call her.
[33:06] Leave it, Mian Jee.
[33:09] Right now whatever you
say will not have an impact on her.
[33:13] Happiness came in her life
after so many years, but…
[33:20] Uncle,
[33:22] you make Mr. Zaman understand,
[33:24] Ayaz is a good boy, he should agree.
[33:27] That’s the deal, huh?
[33:29] Tell me something Mian Jee,
[33:31] our Mian Jee who preaches love and
satisfaction for so many years,
[33:36] how did he forget what he preached.
[33:39] He said no to such a good proposal
due to lack of salary.
[33:43] Hey, that’s not the thing, child.
[33:45] The thing is that Zaman
has come home after so long,
[33:49] so he wants to do something for his sister,
[33:52] so I didn’t want to interfere,
[33:55] but now I feel I will have to interfere.
[33:59] That’s what I am saying to you.
[34:01] People listen to you in the village,
then how will your own son not listen to you?
[34:06] That’s it,
[34:07] when papa comes you have to tell him that
[34:09] you have taken the authority
back in your hands.
[34:11] Earlier you had a right to decide,
and even now you have the right to decide.
[34:15] That’s it,
[34:16] now I have made my full and
final decision that I will fix this proposal.
[34:24] Mian Jee.
[34:26] Mian Jee, you are great. I will go tell Bebo.
[34:32] Bebo fix your mood.
[34:34] Don’t bother me,
my mood is not fine, Rania
[34:36] I have come with an explosive news,
then don’t say you didn’t find out.
[34:40] I have convinced Mian Jee for uncle Ayaz and
I also made him promise that he will convince papa too.
[34:46] Really? Congratulations. Really?
[34:51] Do you believe me or not?
[34:52] Ayaz is calling.
[34:54] You know he has been calling for so long,
but I am not answering it.
[34:57] Give it to me. Swear to me that you
won’t tell him anything right now.
[34:59] I will go home and tell him myself.
[35:01] I can bother him a little. Right? Rania!
[35:12] Uncle? Ayaz.
[35:14] Ayaz. Oh God,
[35:17] this poor thing disappointed heart
couldn’t tolerate such a big news.
[35:23] Oh God what will happen now?
[35:26] I will call the ambulance. Ambulance.
[35:28] Not ambulance, you get the patient
water on such an occasion, sister.
[35:32] Thank God, maybe he is alive.
[35:36] Not maybe. He is alive.
[35:37] He is alive.
[35:38] He is alive.
[35:39] He is alive. Uncle was alive yesterday,
uncle is alive today.
[35:43] Are you joking?
[35:44] I would come from so far for such a bad joke?
[35:46] I have convinced Mian Jee and
I have also told him to tell papa that the proposal is final.
[35:51] Rania,
[35:52] you have lit a lamp of happiness in
my brother’s dark life.
[35:58] I have to do really big things,
this was something ordinary. But yes,
[36:02] uncle is responsible to keep this lamp lit.
[36:05] Hey I will do everything but I don’t understand
how to express this happy occasion?
[36:09] How do I express it? I will sing,
[36:12] I will dance, I will do it, I will party.
[36:15] One, two, three go.
[36:40] One second,
[36:41] I will go give the good news to the neighbours.
[36:43] Poor mama was so worried,
[36:45] she should also know that
I can solve every issue, right?
[36:48] Yes. Yes. You go,
[36:49] we will party again.
