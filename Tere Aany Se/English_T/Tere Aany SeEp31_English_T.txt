[00:44] How are you?
[00:46] You finally miss home?
[00:49] I don’t miss home,
[00:51] but yes, I missed you and wanted to come here.
[00:56] I have heard someone was going
to take out a missing campaign for me.
[01:00] Someone was really worried for me,
they wanted to call me home, huh?
[01:06] Stop smiling and you don’t need to get so happy.
[01:09] Yes, but mama got ready sad
by that action of yours.
[01:13] By the way, leaving the battle field
and running away is not bravery.
[01:22] Then what else could I do, Rania?
[01:24] Fight with my dad?
[01:28] My step mother?
[01:31] No man,
[01:32] I have not been brought up like that.
[01:36] So now, what will you do now?
[01:40] You don’t have the temperament to do a job,
[01:42] and then you don’t find a job so easily nowadays.
[01:45] And how long will you stay at your friend’s home?
[01:47] He will excuse himself one day.
[01:52] Who told you that I will stay at my friend’s home?
[01:55] Hey, we have really rich relatives.
[01:58] I have an uncle, he is really rich,
[02:01] servant, bank balance, cars, he has everything.
[02:05] I will live with him.
[02:06] What was the uncle’s name?
[02:08] Uncle Zaman. Yes.
[02:11] I am not joking, I am serious.
[02:13] So when am I joking? See, I am serious.
[02:17] I have one relationship with uncle Zaman,
[02:20] now if this second one gets formed,
I will be in for a treat.
[02:27] I will come back.
[02:35] He is dying more than
me for my father’s wealth.
[02:39] Oh God.
[02:42] This world is all about money.
[02:46] If you have it, you are in trouble,
if you don’t, you are in trouble.
[02:51] This is the limit.
[02:57] Honey tell me, will you come
or should I come get you.
[03:00] I need your help so much,
but you are not coming.
[03:03] When did I say no?
I am coming to Pakistan.
[03:05] But as soon as I land,
first I will go to my uncle’s home.
[03:08] That uncle, whose face you
have not seen for so long.
[03:11] Honey, why are you making
my blood pressure rise so much?
[03:14] Aunty, I have a blood relation with him.
[03:16] We often talk on call.
[03:19] Now mama passed away,
that doesn’t mean that our relation is over.
[03:23] I will stay there for two to four days,
then I will come to you.
[03:26] You are really stubborn,
if you get stuck on something, you don’t agree.
[03:30] Rania. Rania, wait.
[03:32] Okay bye.
[03:33] Okay, I was asking, should I drop you?
[03:36] I told you there is no need for that,
the van must be on its way.
[03:38] Man, I agree that I have a small ride,
[03:41] it is what the poor drive,
but I can drop you. Come on
[03:44] Don’t talk this nonsense with me.
[03:47] For me a man and humanity are
worth more than money and wealth.
[03:52] And I have nothing to do with the elder papa,
[03:55] nor do I have anything to do with his wealth,
[03:57] so in future don’t talk about this nonsense.
[04:00] Yes, but that is the reality Rania.
[04:02] The wheel of time spun in such a way
that now you are rich and I am poor.
[04:09] The same thing again.
[04:11] If you are so worried about the wheel of time,
then do something yourself.
[04:16] Don’t take favours from anyone.
Just like I don’t.
[04:18] I have decided to work hard, Rania.
[04:21] And I have decided I will do something myself.
[04:27] For the first time in my life,
I heard something smart from you.
[04:32] Hmmm..
[04:33] smile and talk to her.
[04:37] But madam Sweetie has decided you
wont get anything in your hands.
[04:43] Neither my dollars, nor Mahir.
[04:46] Because you threw a brick at me,
now I will throw a stone at you.
[04:53] My van must be there.
You made me get late.
[04:55] Hey, I will drop you.
[05:02] Hello.
[05:03] Did you have breakfast?
[05:06] I will.
[05:07] Okay come on,
today I will make breakfast for you.
[05:10] There is no need for that.
[05:12] Aunt is inside, I will ask her,
she will make flat bread for me.
[05:16] Thank you.
[05:17] Okay listen,
do you want to go to America?
[05:20] I can take you along.
[05:22] It is a simple thing for me.
[05:29] I have no interest in going to America
or some other country.
[05:33] This is Pakistan, my birth place.
[05:36] I won’t leave it and go anywhere. No.
[05:39] There are other people who leave their country
[05:43] and go live in the country of others
as second class citizens, but not me.
[05:46] So thank you and sorry.
[05:57] Where are Mona and Rabail?
Call them.
[06:00] They are working in the kitchen.
Oh okay. Fine.
[06:05] Mama, I want to talk to you about
something really important.
[06:07] Yes, go ahead.
What do you want to talk about?
[06:10] Now?
[06:11] Yes.
[06:14] The thing is that Khaver has told Mona that
[06:18] brother Rafiq is coming with his
family to get the wedding date.
[06:23] But I have lost my sleep after
what he said after that.
[06:26] That boy Khaver, that innocent, naive,
simple boy, he has completely changed.
[06:33] He cannot keep his feet on the ground,
he is flying high.
[06:37] He has told Mona that I will have really
rich friends that will come to the marriage,
[06:42] so the dowry should be grand.
Don’t embarrass me.
[06:45] Tell him, not to embarrass us,
come with your face covered.
[06:50] We too will have relatives comes over.
People from the community will come. Yes?
[06:54] Mama, so I was saying, I don’t understand
from where we will arrange the dowry.
[06:58] Uncle Salim has a government job,
even he cannot arrange it.
[07:01] His sisters have been
upset since the engagement.
[07:07] I don’t understand what we should do.
[07:09] This has a simple solution,
break the wedding.
[07:14] So why do you worry?
[07:15] I have taken the responsibility of
Mona’s wedding, and I will fulfill it.
[07:21] You will see, I will make the dowry,
it will be worth more than Khaver.
[07:29] What is your problem?
[07:31] God have given me enough that
I will not take a favour from you.
[07:36] You don’t worry Seema,
I will live up to my promise.
[07:41] Oh mama,
[07:43] you are great.
[07:44] You have removed all my worry.
[07:46] May your shadow always
be on our heads. Ameen.
[07:50] Ameen.
[08:15] Greetings.
[08:18] Greetings. You are here?
[08:20] You should have gone inside.
[08:22] No, there is no need for that.
[08:24] You didn’t visit the hospital for so long,
nor did you come home.
[08:32] Are You upset with me as well?
[08:35] No, I am not upset with anyone.
[08:40] Don’t lie.
[08:42] My poor papa is worried.
[08:46] He is really worried.
[08:50] In fact, you come with me,
I will show you. Come on.
[08:54] No.
[08:56] I cannot go to your home now.
[08:59] Rania, please don’t do that.
[09:02] And won’t you listen to me, either?
[09:06] Don’t punish papa so badly
for that mistake of his?
[09:10] Is that mistake worth forgiving?
[09:14] Is this mistake only a small mistake?
[09:20] For me this was injustice,
[09:23] it was extreme cruelty,
[09:26] and my mother, me, mian jee
and bebo have suffered for it.
[09:33] You go and tell him that you he goes back to
them for whose sake he broke all relations.
[09:41] Because now we have learned to live without him.
[09:46] But he finds this life incomplete without you.
[09:51] He is waiting for you.
[09:54] But why?
[09:56] I will never go to him now.
[10:01] Never.
[10:44] What a useless film. It is so useless.
[10:47] You are scared for no reason.
There are no ghosts.
[10:49] You will see once again, nothing will happen.
[10:51] The same thing has been happening
for an hour, no ghosts are showing up.
[11:06] This means fate is on my side.
[11:09] Rania is busy watching a movie.
[11:51] No. No.
[12:04] Sweetie.
[12:06] Sweetie. Sweetie.
[12:09] Hey, Sweetie, what are you doing here?
[12:12] Brother Rafiq is going to come.
[12:14] This is the limit. Be quick. Come outside.
[12:16] Nabeel, we have been robbed.
We have been robbed.
[12:20] Huh? What are you saying Sweetie?
[12:22] yes, Nabeel, I had kept thousand dollars
and my diamond ring in my purse myself,
[12:27] it is not there, it has disappeared,
it has been stolen.
[12:30] Okay, calm down. Calm down.
[12:31] You search carefully,
the things must be there.
[12:34] We have never had things
stolen from our home.
[12:36] I have looked everywhere carefully.
I know it has been stolen.
[12:42] Sweetie,
[12:44] come I will help search with you.
Come on. Come.
[12:47] I know we will not find anything from anywhere,
and I know who stole it, I will never forgive them.
[12:53] Hey, talk slowly madam Sweetie.
What are you saying?
[12:56] We cannot put a blame on
anyone for theft in this home.
[12:59] If the robbery happened here in this home,
[13:01] so I will put the blame on
the people living in this home.
[13:03] You can sit quietly over here.
[13:06] I am not that bad grandma,
[13:08] that I enjoy on the wealth
of my rich father all my life.
[13:11] Yes, son.
[13:12] Hey not rich father,
the dollars of the stepmother.
[13:15] Sister talks so much about dollars,
I am thinking I will take my salary in dollars too.
[13:20] You know it is not a bad idea, Shahanshah.
[13:22] Right?
[13:23] Oh. Oh. I got ruined, I got robbed.
[13:28] Oh my Nabeel, I had told him
so many times not to eat these Nihari,
[13:33] trotters, brain, curry,
he never listened to me.
[13:37] Go check on him, what happened?
Take him to the hospital.
[13:40] Sister in law, wear bangles right now
and break them on the table.
[13:44] What are you two staring at?
Go, go and take him to the hospital.
[13:48] There is a possibility
that there is some home.
[13:50] I…I will take him.
Mahir, Mahir, call the ambulance.
[13:53] I will call the ambulance.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
[13:54] Dad. Hey, dad is here.
What happened? How are you?
[13:59] Brother, does anyone walk
around like this after a heart attack?
[14:01] You have shown me stars in the day.
[14:03] What happened? What happened?
[14:05] I am fine. Move back.
[14:06] I am fine, right in front of you.
What attack are you people talking about?
[14:10] Hey your dad has thick skin,
I got robbed, I got ruined.
[14:16] All my dollars and diamond ring got stolen.
[14:19] Hey, you created such a scene that
something happened to my Nabeel.
[14:23] All of you note that
she will make me have a heart attack.
[14:26] Mama, you don’t need to
worry so much for Nabeel.
[14:30] Anyway, this is a long debate, right now I need
my thief who stole everything and ran away.
[14:36] What are you saying?
How would we know? Huh?
[14:39] And thousands of people get robbed on the streets,
[14:41] who told you to keep a diamond
ring in your purse and also dollars.
[14:44] Madam, the robbery happened in
this home and I know who the robber is.
[14:48] Hey, then what the need to worry?
If you know then catch them.
[14:52] Here, I caught you.
[14:53] What are you doing? We don’t joke around?
[14:57] Yes. But we hate each other.
I know from the start you hate me.
[15:01] Hey if you needed money,
then you should have told me,
[15:04] I would have given it in charity.
But you thought stealing was right.
[15:08] You must be in the habit to steal
money since childhood.
[15:10] Aunt Sweetie,
[15:12] do you have any idea of how big of
an allegation you are putting on Rania?
[15:15] What need does she have to steal your dollars?
[15:18] Leave her hand. Leave it. You move.
[15:20] Hey, she needed it the most.
[15:22] She is the one who used to talk about doing a job.
She needed money the most.
[15:25] Hey, be quiet.
[15:27] Or else I will forget that you are
the elder daughter in law of this home.
[15:30] You can do whatever you want,
but I will search her room.
[15:36] Nobody dare to do this.
[15:39] No Mahir, why do you get angry?
[15:41] All of us know that Rania didn’t do
anything, then why are we scared?
[15:44] Let sister in law Sweetie search.
Her heart will be satisfied.
[15:49] And what if you don’t find your
dollars in Rania’s room, then?
Will you apologize to her in front of everyone.
[15:53] Fine, I give everyone my word,
[15:57] I will search her room and
if I don’t find anything in her room,
[16:00] then I will hold my ears and beg
forgiveness from this girl.
[16:05] But I have to search her room.
[16:23] Enough?
[16:24] Are you satisfied?
[16:25] Are you happy?
[16:27] Look at this, for God’s sake, stop this drama.
[16:31] See how the poor thing is in
a bad shape, ask for forgiveness.
[16:38] One minute.
[16:41] She is still not satisfied.
[16:43] What sort of a woman is she?
[16:59] See. My doubt was correct.
[17:08] This.
[17:09] How did this get here?
[17:13] I don’t know. I don’t know, mama.
[17:16] Yes, you don’t know.
[17:18] How would you know, huh?
[17:19] I didn’t do anything.
[17:21] Yes, you are really innocent.
[17:23] The dollars started walking that
they came walking in your room.
[17:26] And then they hid in your pillow.
[17:28] Mama, I never even went in her room.
How will I get it?
[17:33] I know you be quiet child.
I didn’t do it.
[17:35] I know, you didn’t do it. She is a liar.
[17:37] Aunt Sweetie kept this herself.
Oh God.
[17:40] Oh God. Oh God.
[17:42] You are blaming me.
I never saw your room, why would I do that?
[17:47] Mama, last night aunt Sweetie…
Be quiet.
[17:50] Nabeel, this girl is a thief,
I cannot tolerate a thief in my home.
[17:55] I am dragging her out of this home.
[17:58] You get out. Hey, you thief.
[18:00] Hey, how are you dragging her out like this?
[18:02] Hey Sweetie, have you gone mad?
Hey, wait. Stop. Hey.
[18:23] What is going on here?
[18:26] I ask, what is happening here?
[18:33] If anyone looks at my daughter with
a dirty eye, they will see the worst in me.
[18:42] Now why are you all stand quietly?
Will someone tell me what is happening?
[18:47] Zaman,
[18:49] she has gone mad in her arrogance of wealth.
[18:54] She has lost it.
[18:56] But the allegation she put on
our daughter, we have all rejected it.
[19:01] We know our daughter cannot
do something so cheap.
[19:05] Brother Zaman,
[19:06] Rania child, see,
I am begging you for forgiveness.
[19:10] Finger has been pointed at you at this home,
a baseless allegation has been put on you.
[19:17] I am apologizing on everyone’s behalf, forgive is.
[19:21] If you were so brave,
[19:22] you should have attacked me face to face.
[19:25] Why did you attack me like a coward like this?
[19:29] You should have shown some courage.
[19:31] A coward for an enemy is worse
than a brave enemy, aunt Sweetie.
[19:35] And the allegation you have
put it is not just on Rania,
[19:39] it is on the respect of our family,
and we wont forget it ever.
[19:43] We will always remember it.
[19:44] Oh, this is the same example that
the robber is scolding the one who caught them.
[19:49] All of you know that this girl is wrong,
[19:51] but she your relative so you
find her right, and I, who is right,
[19:55] I am wrong because I am an outsider
and no one sympathizes with me.
[19:58] Shut up. Shut up.
[19:59] Don’t you dare say a word to this girl,
I will cut your tongue.
[20:04] Control yourself Mr. Nabeel.
[20:06] How can you say this to me in my home?
[20:09] I will make one call to the embassy,
they will come here,
[20:12] and they will send you and also your
family to the jail. Do you understand?
[20:20] Come on, Rania, child.
[20:23] Come with me.
[20:24] From today, you will live with me.
[20:29] I will tell this woman
[20:31] that I can buy thousand such
homes for my daughter, come on.
[20:34] No. No. Uncle Zaman,
please you don’t take Rania anywhere.
[20:39] I am sorry son,
[20:41] but if Rania herself tells me she wants to live here,
[20:44] still I won’t let her live here.
[20:47] She is not an orphan
[20:49] or oppressed girl that whoever
wants blames her when they want.
[20:56] Her father is alive and
she will live with her father.
[21:02] And if someone has the courage
then they should try to stop me.
[21:13] Come on, child.
[21:21] Such a low life woman trampled
the respect of my family under her feet.
[21:30] She blamed an innocent girl of theft.
[21:34] Mama, don’t call it a blame.
[21:36] I don’t know why all of you
are ready to ignore this fact.
[21:39] Leave us. Leave us alone and go.
Go away to where you came from.
[21:45] It is weird. All of you sympathize with her.
[21:48] You people are behaving
like I went to Rania’s room myself
[21:51] and kept the dollars that go child,
have fun. It is weird.
[21:57] Papa, last night…
Stop it Tipu. Stop it right now.
[21:59] Go to your room my son. Go my son, go.
[22:08] Don’t worry, everything will be fine.
[22:10] How will it be fine?
[22:24] Shall we go?
[22:29] What is the matter?
[22:34] Please child. Please, stop crying.
[22:39] Now only weak people cry,
[22:43] and what are you worried about?
[22:46] Your father is standing with you.
[22:51] Now do you understand
[22:54] how I must have lived
my life without my father.
[23:01] How Mian Jee took care of his
old age and weakness, just for me.
[23:13] To become my shadow,
[23:16] how he must have burned in the sun.
[23:23] Child, forgive me.
[23:26] Today she put such a big allegation
on me considering me alone.
[23:35] She made me fall in everyone’s eyes.
[23:41] Right now everyone is calling me innocent.
[23:44] But once at one time they
will think that maybe I did this.
[23:50] I did this cheap thing for some need.
[23:56] I cannot face anyone right now.
[24:00] Never.
[24:02] Never.
[24:07] You promise me,
[24:09] you wont say anything to Dr. Wasti.
[24:11] You wont tell him anything.
[24:13] What respect will I have left?
[24:16] Why do you worry so much?
[24:18] Please don’t think so much.
[24:22] See, no one was thinking like that about you,
nor will anyone think this way.
[24:27] Everyone was standing with you.
[24:29] Don’t burden your mind
so much for no reason.
[24:34] Now come on.
[24:36] Come.
[24:37] Come on.
[25:05] The question is,
[25:07] why was the doubt on Rania?
[25:09] The people of this home are in
an even worse situation than Rania.
[25:13] Have you seen uncle Hamad,
[25:15] he is jobless, the expenses of his children.
[25:18] And aunt?
[25:19] Aunt is always sad about the fact that
why she is not as rich as aunt Sweetie?
[25:24] Why can she not wear
such expensive clothes.
[25:27] And me?
[25:28] All my expenses are taken care of uncle Dabeer.
[25:31] Then why didn’t she doubt all of us?
[25:34] Why did she search Rania’s room first?
[25:39] Because she wanted to
insult Rania in front of everyone.
[25:42] She wanted to insult Rania in front of everyone
and drag her out of this home.
[25:46] Because obviously, it was Rania who didn’t listen
to her, she used to argue with her.
[25:53] Okay,
[25:55] so all this has done through
a well thought out plan.
[25:59] Rania has been sent out of this
home through a conspiracy. Grandma.
[26:03] Mahir,
[26:04] take out the car and take me to Rania.
[26:09] Don’t ask me any questions,
just take out the car.
[26:12] Hey, how do I take it out grandma?
[26:14] Your beloved daughter in law
has the keys to the car as well.
[26:17] I will not ask her for the keys.
[26:19] Then get a taxi and take me.
[26:24] Fine, I will get a cab.
[26:26] I will also come along.
[26:27] Okay.
[26:35] Who am I?
[26:36] The eldest daughter in law of this home,
[26:38] on whom the responsibility of taking care of this
entire family has been put and my respect?
[26:42] Hey you have no respect.
[26:43] The one who makes their respect is respected.
You have made my head bow down with shame.
[26:49] Everyone trusts that stranger girl so much,
[26:51] and no one cares for the one
who has faced so much loss.
[26:54] Hey, to hell with your loss.
[26:56] What did Rania do to you that
you have become her enemy?
[26:59] Hey, now I understand,
[27:02] you want to drag everyone
out of this home one by one.
[27:07] Because you want to take over our home.
[27:10] Your home? Do you have no shame?
How are you calling this your home?
[27:14] This home is mine.
[27:16] I had a small wish that my name
plate is put outside this home, but now?
[27:20] Now it has become my desire.
[27:22] You know well, Sweetie makes the thing
that she gets after her own.
[27:27] What are you saying, man?
[27:29] Meaning aunty Sweetie put
a blame of theft on Rania?
[27:32] How can she do that?
[27:33] Sister Rania was crying a lot as well.
[27:35] Didn’t her family say anything?
[27:40] Everyone was saying that
sister Rania cannot do this,
[27:43] but this aunt sweetie is really cunning.
[27:46] She must have kept
the dollars in aunt Rania’s room,
[27:49] that is why she went to her room at night.
[27:52] One second.
[27:53] Aunt went in Rania’s room?
[27:55] But when?
[27:56] And how do you know this?
[27:58] I saw her myself,
I got up to drink water at night.
[28:01] One second.
[28:03] Come here, tell me everything in detail.
What happened at night?
[28:22] Oh,
[28:24] okay listen to me.
[28:26] Did you tell everyone this?
[28:28] I was telling everyone,
but no one was listening to me.
[28:31] They were all saying that you be quiet.
[28:34] Come on.
[28:35] Come home with me, I will also see
how your family doesn’t agree. Come on.
[28:43] Zaman son,
[28:45] I am really embarrassed
that in my own home,
[28:52] while I was alive,
[28:55] someone puts a cheap allegation on my Rania.
[29:00] Oh I am saying that how will I face
my brother and my daughter Rania,
[29:08] and how will I live
with this embarrassment?
[29:17] Aunt, why are you blaming yourself?
You have no fault in this.
[29:21] Child, Rania must not want
to see anyone of our faces.
[29:28] You request her that
Rania doesn’t look away from us,
[29:34] and she is not misled
about us in her heart.
[29:40] No aunt, no,
she is not misled about anyone of you.
[29:45] The poor thing fears that you people too
listen to Sweetie and don’t blame her.
[29:51] Hey, no, no nothing like that uncle.
[29:55] We also know Rania and we are also
witness of Mrs Nabeel’s behaviour.
[30:01] None of us can think wrong about Rania.
[30:04] Thank you,
[30:06] but you can understand that
this is such a cheap allegation.
[30:10] My daughter’s soul has been hurt from the inside,
she is unable to forget this moment.
[30:18] Well done. Listen,
[30:20] all that you have told us,
you have to go there and tell there as it is.
[30:23] Come on. Come.
[30:24] I am also coming along, and we have to
come back and embarrass that Sweetie.
[30:28] Hey, where will you go?
[30:30] I am going to tell mama all
the details, I will tell her.
[30:34] No Hammad, this is a really important
moment, it is necessary that I go.
[30:39] I don’t understand one thing,
those who had died for so long,
[30:43] how did they come to life in such a filmy way.
[30:44] Hey, I don’t understand this.
How did he come suddenly?
[30:48] Hamad, did you see properly,
was he really Rania’s father?
[30:52] He was brother Zaman,
I saw him clearly.
[30:56] But he didn’t die, so don’t say anything
stupid when you go there, okay?
[31:00] Okay, we are going son.
Come on. Come on.
[31:02] Who cares about living people?
Come on. Come on.
[31:09] Rania, how did you even think
[31:12] that I would trust Mrs. Dabeer,
I mean, I will trust her and doubt you?
[31:17] Never.
[31:22] I trust you.
[31:25] I was standing with you tomorrow
[31:27] and I am standing with you even today.
[31:31] You trust me so much?
[31:33] More than myself.
[31:35] Yes, if I talk about myself,
[31:37] I can be selfish and do this,
[31:39] but my Rania can never do that.
[31:43] Grandma and Rabail are
waiting for you, they are worried.
[31:48] They have to meet you.
[31:49] Mama is here?
Why did you not tell me earlier?
[31:52] Now I have told you. Come on.
[31:57] Rania is innocent,
[31:59] we were sure of that,
but now that we have proof,
[32:04] I will go throw it in Sweetie’s face.
[32:08] She put such a cheap allegation on my daughter,
I will never forgive her.
[32:13] She has insulted me and my family.
[32:20] Greetings.
Greetings. Come. Come.
[32:23] Hey, my daughter.
[32:33] Have a seat, mama.
[32:34] Your mama will stand till you forgive her.
[32:40] In my own home, in my presence,
[32:43] that woman put a cheap allegation on you.
I cannot face myself, I am so badly shocked.
[32:51] Yes,
[32:54] you trust me right.
[32:56] That is enough for me?
[32:58] You please sit. Sit.
[33:05] Rania child, nature has supported you.
We even have a witness for you.
[33:12] That is why we came after mama.
[33:14] The day aunt Sweetie kept dollars in your room,
Tipu saw her with her own eyes.
[33:20] What?
[33:21] Tipu saw her,
then why didn’t you speak up, idiot?
[33:25] Brother Mahir, I was speaking up,
then but no one listened to me.
[33:30] Because I am a child.
[33:33] Rania child, you come home now.
[33:38] Aunt, her father is still alive,
[33:42] and in my presence
I cannot separate her from me.
[33:54] Mama, I will come.
[33:57] I will surely come and I will also get all
the preparations for Mona’s marriage done.
[34:02] Don’t worry.
[34:05] You people are my own.
[34:08] Well done my princess.
[34:11] My brave daughter.
[34:13] I know you were never
afraid of anyone earlier,
[34:17] and don’t be afraid of
anyone in the future either. Okay?
[34:19] This Sweetie is just dirt in the way,
don’t worry about her. Okay?
[34:26] Understand what I am saying.
[34:30] Thank God this matter is sorted.
Now lets come to the other story.
[34:34] I am restless to hear it for so long.
[34:37] God be kind, what happened?
[34:39] Rania’s papa, where did he come from?
I mean, where did he suddenly…
[34:44] tell us, we have a right too.
[34:49] I…
[34:51] Tell her or she will keep on
going in circles in her restlessness.
[34:56] Yes.
[34:57] Okay, I will tell them.
[35:05] Where did everyone go?
[35:07] They have gone to
aunt Rania’s father’s home.
[35:10] They can go to hell. Who cares?
[35:13] Sweetie, don’t spoil your mood.
[35:16] I want to praise you.
You have such a great mind.
[35:20] Since I have heard about it,
I am shaken to the core.
[35:23] I mean, you put an allegation
of theft on the cunning Rania.
[35:28] Such a conspiracy sister,
I am your fan, I swear.
[35:32] I didn’t setup a conspiracy,
there has really been a theft.
[35:36] Sister, what is there to hide from us?
[35:38] We are servants of the home,
we find out everything.
[35:42] Sister, I swear I too am cunning like you.
[35:46] I would say make me your student,
I will come for tuition to you.
[35:52] I want to be as cunning as you.
[35:55] If I was cunning, then all these people
wouldn’t have been living in my home like this
[36:00] and they wont be spending my dollars.
[36:02] I mean, they are living in my home
and they are showing attitude to me.
[36:05] Am I..am I…what do they call it?
[36:09] Low life?
[36:10] Yes, yes, That. No.
Why would I be a low life?
[36:14] Look this home is mine,
the car parked outside is also mine.
[36:18] The super stores in America are also mine.
[36:21] Low life is someone
who lives on someone else’s money.
[36:25] Anyway, I have also thought
[36:29] that first I will get all these
things in my name
[36:32] and then once I take
Dabeer to America with me,
[36:36] I will not let him come back.
[36:38] In fact, now I have decided that
I will get what I want with interest.
[36:44] Meaning?
[36:46] Now should I tell you everything?
