[00:34] Feed me quickly,
or I will turn off the video.
[00:37] I am feeding you.
[00:44] You two know well that
[00:46] in the greed to watch videos you are making
your lazy father, lazier. Huh?
[00:52] Now it has come to this that
you cannot even peel the peanuts,
[00:54] I don’t know how you are chewing it.
Get out of here.
[00:59] I should see books in your hand,
do your homework.
[01:02] What is this?
[01:04] I don’t like this informality at all.
Okay?
[01:07] Hamad, right now
I just know one thing
[01:10] that my sister and I have
no respect in this home.
[01:14] Zero.
They have taken us lightly.
[01:16] Oh.
[01:18] What, oh?
[01:19] Your arrogant,
haughty nephew.
[01:21] I had just said that
hey take my Mona for ice cream.
[01:26] He said no to my face.
Clear no.
[01:29] Really?
Yes.
[01:30] Mona has her hands and feet,
tell her to eat ice cream herself.
[01:34] What is the big deal in this?
[01:35] It is not that. It is that saying to Mona,
[01:38] he made Rania sit in the car
and he went away.
[01:41] Oh.
[01:43] There is a limit to shamelessness.
[01:44] They are so close and
go together everywhere.
[01:47] And mama?
Mama too has closed her eyes,
[01:50] she is really lenient.
Hamad you are Mahir’s uncle.
[01:54] I say use your right,
stop all this.
[01:57] I use my right.
[01:59] Taking Rania with him comes
under shamelessness,
[02:03] so from tomorrow
he should take Mona.
[02:06] I should say this, right?
[02:07] Oh God, I had forgotten
who I was coming to for help.
[02:10] You don’t even realize
that all the effort
[02:14] that I am putting in is for whom?
For you, for our children.
[02:17] Once Mona gets married to Mahir and
comes to this home, our life will be set.
[02:22] Think of a reasonable plan,
then come to me.
[02:25] Right now, don’t disturb me.
[02:27] I am really busy.
I am really very busy.
[02:30] Now I think of a plan as well,
you don’t want to do anything yourself.
[02:33] Hey, you know how
to conspire and plan,
[02:36] I don’t know how to do it.
[02:38] If you cannot do anything else,
then do one small thing.
[02:41] Can you go to mama and tell her
[02:43] that they are going alone for outing
it puts a question on our family’s name.
[02:49] I can say that.
Yes, then go say it.
[02:51] Right now?
Yes, right now.
[02:55] Fine.
[02:57] Hamad.
[03:05] Why does Mahir dislike his name
with yours so much?
[03:10] I don’t know. It’s up to him.
[03:13] Your friend is really self-loving.
Oh God.
[03:19] My friend
[03:22] and nothing for you?
[03:24] Sadly, he is my relative,
[03:27] but he is always fighting with me.
[03:29] You know since I found out
about his mental issue,
[03:32] I have cut down on the fighting
with him.
[03:34] Now I feel sympathy seeing him.
Poor thing.
[03:37] One minute.
What mental issue?
[03:40] I read about such a person
in the psychology book.
[03:45] It stated…
Rania.
[03:46] Hey, is your duty off?
[03:48] It will get over soon.
[03:49] Okay, you tell me how are you?
[03:51] How is your neighbour’s girl Laiba?
[03:54] Everything is fine.
[03:55] You tell me about your doctor,
[03:57] did his sorrows reduce a little or not?
[03:59] Huh? What sorrows?
[04:02] There is some sorrow,
[04:03] that is why he goes around
with a face that has just cried.
[04:14] What is going on, here?
[04:15] Sir, I didn’t even start anything right now,
[04:18] I already stopped.
[04:19] Had I not stopped myself,
I would have been in trouble.
[04:22] Greetings doctor.
How are you?
[04:24] Will you have some?
You are back here, again?
[04:25] Yes, till the time
you don’t fix our patient,
[04:28] we will keep on visiting. Right?
[04:30] that elderly woman’s condition
is much better,
[04:33] she will be discharged till tomorrow.
[04:34] So why are you saying this
with so much sorrow?
[04:40] What are you saying?
[04:41] Why would I say this with sorrow?
[04:43] And staff is your duty time over?
[04:45] No, sir, just two minutes are left.
[04:47] Then go and do your duty in the ward,
[04:50] don’t stand here and talk.
Sure.
[04:53] And you people go sit
in your patient’s room,
[04:56] what is the reason to roam around
in the hospital like this?
[04:58] Yes, doctor we were going. Yes, Rania,
come on let’s go. Yes, doctor.
[05:06] What is his problem?
[05:08] He is such a negative person.
[05:10] Instead of being a doctor,
he should have been a jailer.
[05:27] Greetings.
Greetings.
[05:29] Yes, where are you?
[05:31] Are you still in the hospital
or have you left?
[05:33] My duty just got off,
I will leave shortly.
[05:38] Okay, do one thing.
When coming home, do meet Salwa,
[05:43] she must be waiting for you.
[05:46] Hello.
[05:48] Hey, what is the matter?
Why are you not answering me?
[05:51] What do I say, papa?
[05:53] She doesn’t care about me.
[05:55] If she cared for me even a little,
then she would have called me,
[05:58] but she didn’t call me.
I always call her.
[06:02] I convince her,
even if it is my fault or not.
[06:04] And you…
I think you don’t even know this.
[06:07] Maybe you never noted him.
[06:08] But this time I have decided
that I wont call her now,
[06:12] I will let her be.
I will wait for her to call me.
[06:16] You are so upset.
Okay, no problem.
[06:18] When you come home
we will talk.
[06:20] Goodbye.
Yes, fine. Goodbye.
[06:32] You?
[06:33] Yes, I came to talk to you
about something.
[06:37] You were busy on the call,
[06:38] maybe you were discussing
a personal matter.
[06:41] I am so sorry…
[06:43] You say what you have come to say.
[06:45] There is nothing left to say now.
[06:48] I have heard you talk.
[06:50] You, yourself…
[06:52] You please say what you came to say.
I told you.
[06:55] Okay.
[06:57] I just came to tell you
[07:02] that a doctor’s medication
doesn’t affect a patient
[07:05] as much as his smile and good nature.
[07:09] But what I heard you talk about,
[07:13] it makes me realize that your own life…
[07:15] Excuse me, miss, whoever you are,
[07:17] I don’t like discussing
my personal life with anyone.
[07:21] You can leave.
[07:22] It is a good habit.
It is a really good habit.
[07:25] You should solve your own issues.
[07:27] Okay, I will leave then.
Goodbye.
[07:33] By the way convincing someone
doesn’t reduce your respect,
[07:37] it increases,
[07:39] and the one who takes the first step
in ending a fight,
[07:44] that person is the strongest.
[07:48] That is, it.
[08:23] Mama, Mahir and Rania
haven’t come till now.
[08:28] Yes, so do you want something?
[08:29] What would I want?
[08:31] I am used to doing all my work
with my own hands.
[08:35] Since when?
[08:36] No mama, I was saying that
[08:37] Mahir and Rania haven’t come back till now.
It is so late at night,
[08:41] the two of them are out at this hour of the night,
it doesn’t seem reasonable.
[08:44] Our family has a custom,
and we are proud of it.
[08:47] The girls of our family are really decent,
respectable and good character
[08:50] and the boys of our family, oh,
[08:52] they are the protectors
of the respect of our family.
[08:55] The customs of our family
should remain like this.
[08:59] Our children shouldn’t be
affected by the society.
[09:02] Stop it.
[09:03] What is the need for such
a long drama. Be quiet.
[09:06] Yes, mama?
[09:10] What do you want to say?
[09:12] Oh mama, what is wrong?
[09:14] I will have to say all this again?
[09:16] Why did you not hear it at the first time,
mama?
[09:19] I heard every single word of yours.
[09:22] Thank God.
[09:23] How did you even think that
Rania would do anything wrong,
[09:28] and that Mahr, can you ever think
anything wrong about him?
[09:32] No. No, mama. I was saying that
[09:34] those two have been gone since the evening,
they are still not back. That’s it.
[09:37] They have gone to the hospital
to meet a patient.
[09:42] Hospital.
[09:43] So what do you think
he has taken her out for ice cream.
[09:46] Hey mama, where did the ice cream
come from? This…
[09:49] Come on, go. Go and rest.
[09:51] You must be tired, you have been
talking for so long. Huh?
[09:55] You are not used to working or talking.
[09:59] You are acting like the protector
of the family name and respect.
[10:04] Mama, tea.
[10:06] Give him tea.
[10:08] He must be tired of coming here
from him room, to complain.
[10:13] Mama, if he drinks tea,
he will get tired too.
[10:16] Tea.
[10:18] Is it hot?
What?
[10:25] Mama, can I go to my room?
[10:27] Get lost.
[10:51] Thank God, Ifrah’s grandmother
is fine now.
[10:55] The staff was telling me that she will
get discharged from the hospital soon.
[10:57] You were getting
so frank with the staff
[11:00] like she is your childhood friend.
[11:02] Yes. Like you are my childhood fiancé.
[11:06] When they were calling you my fiancé,
[11:08] your face was a to watch.
I had a lot of fun.
[11:11] I had a lot of fun. Enough.
[11:13] It was not that funny.
[11:15] I saw how you were enjoying it,
[11:17] ask me what my heart
was going through.
[11:20] Listen to me, don’t be so arrogant.
[11:23] So much self-loving is not good.
Believe me.
[11:26] As far as I am concerned,
I will make a will when I die,
[11:30] no girl should marry an arrogant
and short tempered man.
[11:34] She should die single,
but never get into this problem.
[11:38] By the way, your wife,
[11:42] poor thing, will be the unluckiest girl
in the world.
[11:47] Rania, If you say another word,
[11:49] I am telling you,
I will bang the car somewhere.
[11:51] Oh God, so much anger
on something so small.
[11:54] Right now I am being lenient,
[11:56] I am explaining it to you
in a friendly manner.
[11:58] I am explaining it to you
for your betterment.
[11:59] I know you are a broken
and sad man on the inside.
[12:05] God knows what mental issues
you suffer from.
[12:08] Are you mad?
[12:10] I am broken, sad, and mental?
[12:12] Are you mad?
[12:13] You don’t need to express
what you think of me, please.
[12:17] This.
The way you scream and talk,
[12:19] it tells me what goes on in your heart.
[12:21] I didn’t scream,
[12:23] but now I will scream so loudly
[12:27] that you will open the car door
and jump outside.
[12:29] You…
[12:30] you don’t come in front of me.
[12:32] I lose my temperament seeing you.
[12:35] Oh God, I hurt a mad man.
[12:40] Forgive me.
[12:47] Here you go, your tea.
[12:52] What happened?
What are you thinking?
[12:55] Arbab didn’t call me or message
[12:58] and I am sitting here packing my bags.
[13:00] Hey, Khawar has said that all the matters
between you and mama have been sorted,
[13:04] then why are you worried?
[13:05] And I am sure brother Arbab
is busy in some work,
[13:07] that is why he didn’t come.
Don’t worry.
[13:09] Yes, so what is the issue
in making a call or message?
[13:11] Don’t think useless things sitting here,
he will come.
[13:15] Hey, Shehanshah,
[13:17] you are playing here with the kids,
and you have an exam today.
[13:20] Have you made any preparations?
[13:21] Sister Rania is working so hard on you.
And you?
[13:24] If you fail again, then you will see
what I will do.
[13:27] I will take your phone.
[13:30] Come on, get up. Get up.
[13:38] Are the kids home?
Rania and Mahir?
[13:40] No mama, they have not come till now.
[13:43] Hey, brother Mahir is here.
[13:45] Greetings.
Greetings.
[13:47] Greetings grandma. Grandma,
[13:49] I will never take your beloved
anywhere after today.
[13:54] Hey, what happened?
What is the issue?
[13:57] She is an ill-mannered girl.
[14:00] She has no manners. See, this.
She doesn’t know how to talk to anyone.
[14:03] Leave it. I cannot believe this.
[14:06] She is so pretty, she has a smiling face.
[14:10] And there is you, you have a frown
on your face all the time.
[14:14] Learn, come on.
[14:16] See, the wives of upset men
are tired of them.
[14:22] I don’t know why you always take her side.
[14:26] I feel you are not my grandmother.
[14:29] Hey, don’t you people want to eat?
We have been waiting for you,
[14:31] we are sitting here, hungry.
Yes, get the food served.
[14:39] This lawn sale!
[14:46] Hello.
[14:47] Hey, Rania, child,
how are you?
[14:49] I am fine, how are you?
and Mian Jee? And aunt?
[14:53] Like you really care.
[14:54] You have forgotten us going to the city,
you have gotten busy.
[14:56] You don’t call.
[14:57] Bebo is really upset with you,
you know.
[14:59] I have really become really busy,
[15:01] think that I got the chance
to do social work now.
[15:04] Hey, what work?
[15:06] Don’t get in any work, don’t embarrass us,
don’t ruin our respect.
[15:10] What is there to be embarrassed
in this, mama?
[15:13] I have never understood this,
nor will I ever understand it.
[15:16] Rania, listen to me,
[15:18] you don’t have to get involved
in any problem. Understand?
[15:20] Okay leave it, I have called you to tell you
something really weird.
[15:25] God be kind. What happened?
[15:28] You know, me and Rabail went
to a really big mall for shopping.
[15:31] Rabail was shopping,
I didn’t want to get anything.
[15:34] I was just looking at people
come and go.
[15:36] And you know what I saw.
What did you see?
[15:40] Mama, papa’s look alike.
[15:42] It felt like papa came out of the picture
and came in front of me.
[15:46] Papa?
[15:48] Papa, meaning Mian Jee?
[15:50] No, no, papa, meaning my papa.
[15:54] What are you saying, Rania?
[15:56] You too got surprised right?
I felt the same way.
[15:59] Then I realized,
I am making such a big mistake,
[16:05] my father is no longer in this world.
[16:07] It was a stranger,
who didn’t even know.
[16:11] You did good that
you didn’t go after him.
[16:13] You don’t go after
any stranger like this.
[16:16] And nor do you ask any questions.
[16:18] Even if you see him again,
don’t go after him,
[16:20] nor ask him any questions.
[16:23] Do you understand me?
[16:25] Fine. You know, mama,
when papa passed away,
[16:30] I must really miss him,
I used to cry as well, right?
[16:33] I have told you so many times
that you were really young.
[16:36] Just remember this
[16:37] that your Mian Jee has brought you up,
[16:39] he has taken care of your wishes like father.
He has taken care of your desires.
[16:42] By the way, how was papa?
[16:45] He must really love me.
[16:47] What is wrong? No. No, he didn’t love you,
he didn’t stay with us.
[16:51] Why are you talking about these
useless things after so many years?
[16:53] Whenever I talk to you
or Mian Jee about papa,
[16:56] you people avoid the discussion.
[16:58] He was my father, it is my right
to know about him.
[17:02] Okay child, you have a lot of time.
[17:04] I have been up since morning,
I am tired of working.
[17:07] Now we will talk tomorrow.
Goodbye.
[17:23] Can you people not play any silent games?
Like carom, or ping pong.
[17:28] Oh, good morning, Mr. Mahir.
[17:31] Good morning.
[17:32] By the way, Mahir, I was noticing
[17:34] that my Mona and
you have the same habits.
[17:39] She too sleeps all day long on a holiday,
your temperament, your habit,
[17:43] you know what people call this
beautiful coincidence?
[17:47] Made for each other.
[17:48] Aunt, please, for God’s sake,
[17:51] don’t spoil my mood
early in the morning.
[17:54] I am really hungry, get me breakfast.
[17:56] Shehanshah,
[17:58] you still haven’t broomed the place,
[18:00] I have already cleaned mama’s room.
Work fast.
[18:09] What are you doing?
The dust is coming in my mouth.
[18:12] People with delicate temperament
can leave from here,
[18:14] because we will clean
all day long today.
[18:19] Oh.
[18:20] Careful. Careful. Careful.
Did you hurt yourself?
[18:22] No.
[18:24] But thank you so much,
you saved me.
[18:26] Mona, Mahir. Mahir Mona,
[18:29] both of them are in a bad mood
on a holiday.
[18:33] Shehanshah,
I feel this sofa will have to move.
[18:37] Come on, get up. Get up.
Come on. Get up.
[18:39] What is your problem?
[18:41] What do you mean, problem?
[18:42] God knows what trash has been
thrown under this.
[18:44] Now we have to clean up.
I don’t have all day, madam.
[18:47] You will have to get up.
Come on, get up.
[18:48] Listen. Listen. Listen.
I have an idea.
[18:51] You people go sit in my room,
[18:52] I will also send breakfast there,
you people talk to each other.
[18:55] There is no need for that,
[18:56] I am not going anywhere,
I am fine here.
[18:58] Hey, is this how you talk to elders?
[19:01] She must be saying it
after thinking.
[19:03] Or are you afraid of Mona
by any chance?
[19:06] I am not afraid of anyone.
[19:09] Then come on, please.
[19:12] Then go, let me clean up.
[19:15] Come on.
[19:16] I am sending flat bread with
cheese omelette. Okay? Huh?
[19:32] Uncle.
Yes?
[19:34] Yes.
[19:35] Are you busy?
[19:37] I wanted to talk about something.
Okay fine, I will talk later, then.
[19:40] Hey, no, sit talk to me. Sit.
[19:43] Here you go.
[19:46] Here.
[19:48] I am no longer busy.
What happened?
[19:52] Uncle, Rania called yesterday.
[19:53] Okay.
[19:55] She went with Rabail
to the mall for shopping.
[19:58] Yes.
[19:59] So she was saying she saw a man
who looked like her father there.
[20:06] Usman?
[20:09] Then did he meet him?
Talk to him?
[20:12] She went to talk to him.
[20:14] But he got lost in the crowd,
she couldn’t talk to him.
[20:19] Uncle.
[20:21] Uncle, Rania is my only wealth,
I don’t want to lose her.
[20:25] You do anything,
just call her back.
[20:29] What are you saying?
[20:32] Rania knows what she has to do.
Rania is ours,
[20:36] he cannot take her and go.
[20:38] Uncle, he is her father.
[20:40] Hey, you are her mother.
[20:42] I am also there. Mian Jee.
[20:46] You surprise me.
[20:48] As much as we love her,
[20:51] she loves us equally.
[20:54] She won’t go anywhere.
[20:57] Uncle, the city she is in,
[21:00] Usman is in the same city.
[21:03] If not sooner, then later,
she will come face to face with him.
[21:06] You make any excuse and call her back.
I want my daughter here.
[21:11] Don’t worry, she won’t go anywhere.
[21:21] Come on, go.
[21:31] Wow. Wow.
[21:33] Child, you have made everything
shine in a way
[21:37] that everything looks new.
[21:39] Well done. Well done.
[21:42] Mona, if you are done with breakfast,
then go with Shehanshah
[21:45] and set Mahir’s room as well.
You have a lot of style?
[21:49] Me? Why?
[21:51] Are the servants at home freeloaders,
[21:53] and you know my lifestyle,
how can I do all this?
[21:57] It is fine, no need for it.
My room is clean.
[22:00] No one will come to my room.
[22:07] Mama you sent brother Mahir
for no reason.
[22:09] He was in no mood to go with Mona.
[22:12] Child, she is a guest.
She is our relative.
[22:18] See it is our responsibility
to take care of her.
[22:22] Still mama,
he was not in the mood…
[22:24] Mama, guests have come over.
[22:26] Guests?
[22:29] My in-laws must have come.
Come on, mama.
[22:32] I am coming.
I am coming.
[22:35] Who is there?
Our neighbours.
[22:38] The ones who live next door.
Oh…
[22:48] Sit. Sit. Have a seat, aunty.
[22:50] I will get tea arranged for you.
[22:51] Hey, no child, where are you going?
You sit next to me.
[22:54] I find her so pretty,
sit next to me.
[22:58] Aunt, see your neighbours are here.
[23:01] Hey, have a seat.
Have a seat.
[23:05] Sit. Sit.
[23:07] Welcome hundred times.
Greetings mama,
[23:09] you must know me,
we have met earlier.
[23:12] You had also praised me,
do you remember?
[23:14] I don’t praise anyone for no reason.
How is your daughter now?
[23:18] Thank God, she will start going
to school in a few days.
[23:21] I came to thank you.
[23:25] Rania has done a good deed with us.
[23:28] The way you cared for Ayaz and
Farhad when I was in the hospital,
[23:33] I really want to thank you for it.
[23:35] Hey no, neighbours help neighbours.
There is a good idiom for it.
[23:40] Blaming others for you own faults.
[23:43] How can a monkey appreciate
the taste of ginger?
[23:47] A person who copies others…
The neighbour is like a relative.
[23:53] Yes, that idiom.
[23:55] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[23:57] See this girl has said something so good,
she is angel, always smiling.
[24:07] Mama.
[24:08] Mama, this is Rabail,
[24:10] she is Rania’s cousin,
she too is really good, really caring.
[24:13] Greetings aunty.
[24:14] Greetings, live long.
[24:16] So what was I telling you?
[24:17] she used to take care of everyone
at the hospital.
[24:20] She cared for all the patients.
She used to get connected to everyone,
[24:23] she used to get their good wishes.
she is a really good child.
[24:26] Mama. Mama,
[24:28] Rabail’s college is right next
to Laiba’s school.
[24:32] So, why don’t we send Laiba
with Rabail from tomorrow, huh?
[24:35] Yes, we can think about it.
[24:37] Okay so child, Rania,
what are you getting an admission?
[24:39] You know, I am thinking that
a smart child like you,
[24:42] whichever institute you go
to for your education,
[24:44] you will make them proud.
[24:46] My Rania is my brother
Anwar Siddique’s copy.
[24:51] Both of them are pride of the family.
[24:53] Yes, yes, I praise her day and night.
[24:57] I have also told Laiba that she should spend
maximum amount of time, day and night, with Rania.
[25:02] I find her to be so pretty,
I want to take her to my home.
[25:06] The child is so smart.
[25:10] This world’s most beautiful, good, and caring
girl is my sister from today.
[25:15] Okay?
[25:17] Congratulations. Congratulations.
Congratulations.
[25:19] By the way, why are you so quiet, and good,
and great, coolness ends at you,
[25:25] why didn’t you get married
till now?
[25:26] Listen to me,
her husband is a big feudal.
[25:30] I think we should leave now,
sister.
[25:32] Sit down.
[25:33] everyone is married.
[25:35] Did you want to make someone
your sister too?
[25:36] Hey, no.
[25:42] You already have a sister at home,
[25:44] then why did you need
to start a new conversation.
[25:46] Such a pretty, caring and loving girl,
[25:48] I had thought, she will come to my home
and my home will lighten up.
[25:51] But, when do I have this happiness
or peace in my life?
[25:55] Hey, you look around,
there is a lot of happiness…
[25:59] Move back, don’t talk to me.
[26:00] Mama, what happened?
[26:01] Ask him. What happened?
[26:03] Laiba I will tell you,
[26:05] I in the presence of all the witnesses put a veil
on Rania’s head and made her my sister forever.
[26:09] Wow. This is a good thing.
[26:11] So from today, I too announce
to make Rania my sister.
[26:14] Hey you are the only one left,
you too announce it.
[26:16] Hey, sister,
I have my own sorrows,
[26:18] I don’t get into all this.
[26:20] And by the way,
[26:22] you too know that who in this home
who is not married,
[26:26] who is the elder.
That is me.
[26:28] Is anyone thinking about me?
No one is thinking.
[26:30] I am going.
[26:31] Where are you going?
[26:32] Hey, I am going to get yogurt,
you had asked me to get it.
[26:36] Whatever home she goes to
she will change it for the good.
[26:39] I had thought I would talk with signals,
but how could I talk?
[26:42] My son announced to make her,
his sister.
[26:48] It won’t happen.
[26:49] Hey mama, you are great.
[26:52] It is your turn now.
Here you go.
[26:55] Give mama another turn.
She is winning.
[26:57] Mama, go ahead.
[26:58] Brother Mahir is here.
[27:00] I was about to call you.
It is good you people are back.
[27:04] Yes, mama was thinking that the pair
of moon and sun have stepped out,
[27:08] the world will die of amazement.
[27:11] Mona, so many things? Show me,
what all did you get?
[27:15] I will not show it right now.
[27:17] When I put it on
you can see for yourself.
[27:19] Showing something again and again,
makes it old, no?
[27:22] I think she didn’t show him anything,
[27:25] she just showed him the bags.
That is why he is so pale.
[27:28] Did someone ask you to speak?
[27:30] And grandma, all the guests
that come to this home,
[27:33] they are all your guests.
[27:34] You don’t give me their responsibility.
[27:36] Oh, my son is tired.
That is why he is saying all this.
[27:41] You are absolutely right.
[27:42] Same temperament.
[27:45] When I get tired,
[27:47] I too become ill-mannered like this.
[27:51] Grandma,
[27:53] I will not go anywhere
with this girl after today.
[27:55] She is totally mad.
[27:57] I met my friends in the mall
coincidentally.
[28:00] She was coming on to me
in front of them,
[28:03] like we have a scene.
[28:06] Here you go,
[28:07] mama, the boy is feeling shy.
We thought he was tired.
[28:12] Mama, you make her be quiet.
[28:14] Tell her not to interfere in my matters.
[28:16] Okay come on, go to sleep.
I know you are tired. Go.
[28:20] Watch now.
Watch, mama.
[28:22] This shot is really easy.
I will try one more time.
[28:28] No, no, you don’t get two turns.
[28:30] Mama, she is cheating.
[28:36] Why is he coming back in our lives
after so long?
[28:43] I put a stone on my heart,
[28:47] when Rania finds out
her father is alive,
[28:53] will she be able to put
a stone on her heart?
[28:56] The way she talked about
her father yesterday,
[29:03] I feel she will forgive him.
[29:06] Sister,
[29:08] why do you worry?
[29:11] It is possible that is written in fate.
[29:16] But I will not forgive him.
[29:31] Usman.
[29:33] Usman, listen to me.
Don’t do this.
[29:35] If not me, then care about your daughter.
[29:38] Look, if you leave us and go,
then the world will kill us in our life.
[29:43] Then make your uncle understand this.
[29:46] He too should know
[29:48] the result of a forced marriage.
[29:51] From today, you and your child
are their responsibility.
[29:58] And if this child asks, then tell her
[30:01] that her father is dead.
Don’t do that, Usman.
[30:04] Don’t do that.
[30:05] This is our daughter,
she is both our responsibility,
[30:08] don’t do that.
Leave me,
[30:10] I said leave me.
[30:13] You want to make this girl
the shackles of my leg,
[30:15] and I won’t let that happen.
Leave me.
[30:17] No, no, listen to me.
I won’t let you go.
[30:20] Don’t go Usman.
Don’t go Usman.
[30:25] Don’t go.
[30:28] Don’t go leaving us, Usman.
[31:08] Don’t cry, Rania.
[31:12] I promise you child,
from today
[31:16] I am your mother and father.
[31:20] Usman is dead.
[31:23] He is dead.
[31:25] He is dead for my Rania.
[32:05] Hey wow,
[32:07] you can also ride a bike.
It is surprising.
[32:10] Good.
[32:11] Oh, you too can ride a bike.
It is surprising.
[32:17] Hah,
[32:17] I was really praising you with my heart.
[32:22] How are you?
[32:24] A-one, you tell me.
[32:25] All good.
[32:28] I was waiting for you since morning.
[32:31] Let me meet Rabail.
[32:35] Why?
[32:37] I mean just like that.
[32:38] She is a really good girl, that is why.
[32:41] She is really good, everyone likes her.
[32:43] Hey, I didn’t mean that.
She is good.
[32:46] I was saying that,
I am in love with her.
[32:50] Love?
Yes.
[32:52] Go. Go.
[32:54] I know the love of you loafers well.
I don’t trust you.
[32:58] Hey,
[32:59] what sort of cruel girl are you?
[33:02] I hadn’t even imagined that
you could be so cruel.
[33:04] I can be a lot crueller than this.
[33:07] Huh?
[33:08] Have you forgotten,
I made you my sister.
[33:11] A brother is in trouble and
you won’t even help him?
[33:13] I need your help.
Sister!
[33:16] Oh yes, bro. I just remembered.
[33:19] Yes. Yes.
Yes. I need your help.
[33:23] I will have to think about it.
But I will tell you something.
[33:27] If you are involving me, then
I will make this story reach the end
[33:30] and if child, you lose your path,
get scared or run away,
[33:34] then this sister will break your legs.
[33:37] Understand?
[33:39] Okay.
[33:40] Bye bro.
Bye.
[33:43] Don’t forget.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
[33:51] Brother.
[33:53] Go ahead.
[33:54] What is the dish that
doesn’t require onions?
[33:58] This one has made me cry like crazy.
[34:01] The maids don’t come home,
like we will eat them.
[34:04] Hey. Oh.
[34:06] Oh.
[34:08] Ouch. Oh damn it,
[34:10] if the maid isn’t coming,
then work yourself.
[34:17] Everyday I slip and fall
on the sofa or on the floor.
[34:21] I don’t have the courage to get
my bones broken in this age.
[34:25] Oh my back. Oh,
[34:28] what happened to you?
[34:30] I am alive. I am safe.
I have not died that you are crying.
[34:34] Hey papa, I am not crying
cause you feel,
[34:36] this onion has me crying.
[34:42] Oh,
[34:43] son, Arbab.
[34:46] Son, listen to me.
[34:49] Both maids have quit the job and
went saying there is no woman at home.
[34:55] We cannot work in a home
that has just three men.
[34:59] I know, papa
[35:00] Then what have you thought, son?
[35:02] We will keep a mail servant,
[35:04] I cannot plead to the servants daily.
[35:07] Hey idiot,
[35:09] you can please to your wife, right?
Not at all.
[35:12] I can beg a servant that madam
for God’s sake work in our home,
[35:16] but not there.
[35:18] Khawar, do you hear him?
[35:20] He is in the mood to get me insulted
in front of sister.
[35:23] What will she think about us?
That we are such misers and cheap.
[35:28] We started sweating when asked to put
a little wealth in the daughter in law’s name.
[35:33] Tell them that this home has
no worth in our eyes,
[35:37] we are really rich.
[35:40] It doesn’t matter to me
what your sister says.
[35:43] I don’t want a wife that loves money.
[35:46] Hey Khawar, make him understand.
[35:49] In fact, leave it.
You get ready,
[35:52] the two of us will get Saman.
Yes.
[35:55] Hey, no papa, leave it today.
Lets wait for a day or two,
[35:58] I will make him understand,
I will convince him.
[36:01] Okay fine,
[36:03] then make tea for me, quickly.
[36:06] Hey…
[36:09] Chop the onions at least, papa.
[36:15] Why did you bring me
to their home?
[36:18] You should meet up with the neighbour,
you always tired girl.
[36:21] And Laiba came back
from the hospital,
[36:23] now is it your responsibility
to ask how she is, or not?
[36:27] Yes, that is fine, but…
[36:38] Am I dreaming?
[36:42] Ouch.
[36:43] You are not dreaming,
it is the reality.
[36:45] The thing is that Rania Ahmad turns
dreams into reality, Mr. Neighbour.
[36:51] This means you have done
another favour on my life.
[36:55] What favour?
Tell her,
[36:58] what favour are you talking about?
[36:59] I will tell you.
I will tell you.
[37:02] First you come inside,
we will talk.
[37:06] I…
[37:07] we just came to meet Laiba,
right? so…
[37:10] Oh,
[37:12] I wish I was admitted in the hospital
instead of Laiba,
[37:15] so you would have come to ask how I was.
You would have come, right?
[37:18] No issue. Get run over by a truck,
[37:21] we will come daily to find out
how you are. For sure.
[37:24] You talk a lot man.
[37:26] You come in.
Come in.
