[00:16] I don't know why I've been having
an intense headache since morning.
[00:21] How do I tell?
Make tea for me.
[00:26] Tea doesn't cure headaches,
[00:28] I'll oil your hair and give
a head massage.
[00:30] No, I don't want to get my hair oiled.
Hey, try it once at least.
[00:35] Grandmother,
[00:38] yesterday, father called me.
[00:42] Really? What was he saying?
[00:43] He was asking about you,
[00:45] I told him you have to offer
prayer early morning
[00:47] so you sleep early at night.
It’s me, a wanderer
[00:51] who roams around with friends,
and comes home late.
[00:54] That's why I attended the call.
[00:56] Mother, I should bring the heated oil.
[00:58] Wait, where are you going?
[01:00] Listen to what father had to say.
[01:01] What am I going to do about it?
[01:04] He is your father,
he can say anything.
[01:06] Oh, no, no, Rania.
[01:08] You were mentioned a lot yesterday.
[01:10] You should hear about it.
[01:12] Mine?
[01:14] Random, casually.
No, no one is discussed randomly.
[01:18] Grandmother,
father is becoming her fan.
[01:22] The stories of her greatness,
[01:24] her qualities and her purity
reached America.
[01:27] And father became her fan.
[01:29] I told him to call her to America.
[01:31] That'd be great right?
[01:33] This way our country would be spared of
this backbiting and backstabbing girl.
[01:39] My child now you should go
get the hair oil for me.
[01:42] Go get it.
Yes.
[01:49] Oh wow Mahir,
today you're at home.
[01:53] What is she saying,
[01:54] was she the one who complained
about me to father?
[01:58] What do you mean?
[01:59] What are you trying to say?
[02:01] Just that,
[02:02] if not the people at your home than
at least care about your guests.
[02:06] That's also a tradition
at your house,
[02:09] to respect your guests,
give them attention.
[02:12] Right grandmother?
My child, are we not taking care of you?
[02:17] What do you need, tell us.
[02:21] I want to go out somewhere.
[02:23] She must've done it.
[02:25] When my guests will be here, I'll give
them attention and respect them as well.
[02:32] But for backstabbers like
them I have no respect
[02:36] and nor do I have any space
in my home.
[02:39] I really dislike the people
who are always complaining.
[02:44] Mahir
Pathetic.
[02:45] What are you saying?
[02:50] Chaos.
[02:56] Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.
We're done, we're done.
[02:59] Come on children, game over.
[03:01] Let's go inside, open your bags
and take out your books.
[03:03] Your teacher is coming
to teach you.
[03:05] No sister Rania,
he won't be coming today.
[03:07] Who told you that?
He, himself.
[03:10] Hey, Khawar,
[03:12] come inside if you're already here,
[03:13] where are your pupils wandering?
[03:15] Oh uncle, welcome.
How are you?
[03:19] Oh child, forget about us,
tell us what's the situation here?
[03:23] Everything is alright.
[03:25] And anyway, in my presence,
God only write peace.
[03:29] Listen to me sister,
is brother Mahir inside?
[03:33] I'm telling you, if I'm here you don't have
to be worried or afraid.
[03:38] Come on, let's go inside.
Come on.
[03:40] Let's go my child, have courage.
Let's go.
[03:42] Come on.
[03:44] Mano, throw the ball.
Mother,
[03:47] place your hand on your heart
and answer me honestly.
[03:50] Should we or shouldn't we misbehave
with the guests at home?
[03:53] Here we go.
[03:55] She complained to you.
[03:56] Your sister does not know
anything else.
[03:58] She's always causing a scene
or complaining.
[04:01] Even if she has 10,000 things to do,
she'll leave everything to make time for this.
[04:06] Mother, she has a small,
fragile heart.
[04:08] She's crying ever since
and she's still crying.
[04:10] Well Mahir you misbehave
with her a lot.
[04:12] At least think about me
I'm your aunt.
[04:15] Mother, see who's here.
Who's here?
[04:17] Come on and check
for yourself who this is.
[04:20] Is it an appropriate time
for someone to come?
[04:22] Oh God.
[04:24] Chaos.
[04:28] Come on in Mother.
[04:30] Come on.
[04:32] Here they are.
[04:36] Greetings sister.
Greetings, greetings.
[04:41] Have a seat.
[04:43] Let me get sister Saman
Stop, stop, stop, wait a minute.
[04:48] Why are you in a hurry?
Let us talk first.
[04:52] Rafique Ahmed,
what lead you here?
[04:54] Sister, you're requested
to get Saman called.
[04:58] Sure, go call Saman.
I'll get her.
[05:02] Hey Shehensha,
prepare some tea, go.
[05:06] Yes? Speak.
[05:10] Let Saman come,
then we'll tell.
[05:19] Greetings.
Greetings my child, live long.
[05:23] Come, come sit with us.
[05:33] Sister, we won't take much time.
[05:36] Arbab.
[05:38] Here, mother,
we've bought the papers.
[05:42] You can check this,
this is what you wanted?
[05:45] Sister, I've transferred my house
to Saman's name.
[05:51] Well whatever
I own is for my children.
[05:55] But still respecting your wishes,
[05:58] I've named my house
to Saman in my life.
[06:04] Give it to her.
[06:05] No, keep it Rasheed Ahmed, keep it.
Keep the papers, keep your properties.
[06:12] It was only about values.
[06:16] May she stay happy at her house.
That's it.
[06:21] Take this.
[06:24] Uncle,
[06:25] I only need your love and prayers.
[06:33] Sister, now can we take the honor
of our home with us?
[06:38] Why not.
I'll get Ammad,
[06:40] she should be here on this event as well.
[06:42] Yes, call her.
[06:44] Live forever, uncle Rafique.
[06:46] This is how great people are,
[06:49] the ones who do not value money
and properties.
[06:52] Instead, people are important to them,
[06:55] they value their daughter-in-laws
and daughters.
[06:58] Wow uncle,
[06:59] I swear you made us
all delighted today.
[07:02] I hope, the young ones could learn
from the elders as well.
[07:08] I should get something sweet
for this joyous occasion.
[07:13] What happened?
[07:15] You're escaping quietly today?
[07:16] Aren't you going to ruin anything today?
[07:27] Bye.
Take care.
[07:30] Go to your home with happiness.
[07:35] May God keep you happy and healthy.
[07:38] Okay sister, bye.
Bye.
[07:41] Bye.
Bye. Let's go, son.
[07:43] Bye.
[07:48] Finally, my child went to her home.
[07:52] Let's go, let's go.
[08:05] Thank God,
my child went back home.
[08:10] Hey, you could've come
to see off your sister.
[08:14] The whole caravan went to see her off,
was I important?
[08:18] Why are you angry now?
[08:20] You don't understand grandmother.
[08:22] They were showing off their wealth.
[08:24] "We don't have a problem in transferring
a tiny house to Saman's name "
[08:27] All of it was a show,
they just wanted to degrade us.
[08:31] Here we go, new chaos.
[08:33] They're such good people.
[08:35] They've given so much respect
in agreeing to mother.
[08:37] Or they could've stayed away
by taking this as a problem for their ego.
[08:40] You shouldn't say anything
in the matters of our home.
[08:42] Go inside.
[08:44] Do not breathe fire at all times.
[08:47] It's enough for us that they heard us
[08:50] and took our daughter with respect.
[08:53] Okay,
[08:54] but if Saman ever comes back here
after a fight or argument,
[08:57] don't say anything to me.
[09:00] I won't engage in her matters
today onwards.
[09:02] You shouldn't worry,
they'll value her,
[09:05] take care of her.
They're good people.
[09:08] We'll see!
[09:21] Thank God our plan succeeded and
sister Saman is finally at her home.
[09:24] All credit goes to you.
[09:25] If you hadn't gone to uncle Rafique’s house
and told brother Arbab
[09:29] that sister has become sick
by missing him
[09:32] and she needs his love,
not his wealth.
[09:34] Without you saying all this,
he wouldn't have come here.
[09:38] You should praise my plan.
[09:45] Wow what a brilliant thing
you have done.
[09:49] Is this praise enough?
Or do you want more
[09:51] Coming into someone's room
without permission is unethical,
[09:55] I guess no one taught you that.
[09:56] Poking your nose in someone's
family matter is also unethical,
[10:01] guess no one taught you that.
[10:06] Saving other people’s homes
is a blessing
[10:10] and I can proudly say that
I have earned this blessing.
[10:14] Your father and my uncle Dabeer
has given me this authority.
[10:18] And he said that if their stupid son
interferes in my business
[10:22] then I should inform him so he could
knock some sense into you.
[10:26] So that was you,
[10:29] you told lies about me to my father.
[10:33] You’ve manipulated the truth so much
[10:36] that he’s angry and disappointed in me.
[10:39] Because of you, I got angry
at that poor Mona.
[10:43] Oh! That poor Mona.
[10:44] quickly go and talk to her what if
she complains about you in real?
[10:50] I’ll get back at you.
Okay.
[10:57] Is he mad?
[10:59] He heard everything.
[11:01] So what?
We are not afraid of anyone.
[11:08] Hi Ifrah, yes.
[11:09] Hi Mahir,
how are you?
[11:11] I am good, now get to the point,
why did you call?
[11:14] Mahir,
[11:16] mother and father are back from
London can you come over?
[11:19] I can but, I guess I should come,
[11:22] I am not in a good mood I guess visiting
you people will cheer me up.
[11:26] Good, come quickly
[11:28] and bring Rania with you,
grandmother really misses Rania
[11:31] I have to bring Rania?
Then the plan cancelled,
[11:34] I am not coming.
[11:35] Why are you showing
so much attitude Mahir,
[11:38] I already told you Grandmother
is waiting for both of you.
[11:40] I am not talking to her.
[11:43] Oh then I will call Rania,
[11:47] and I will talk to her so you don't have
to worry about anything.
[11:51] You just have to bring her here
[11:55] what the heck.
[12:00] You’re getting a call.
Here.
[12:05] Yes Ifrah?
[12:06] Rania, grandmother is missing you,
[12:08] I have talked to Mahir
so you can come with him.
[12:12] Elders are calling me and
I won’t come? That’s just not possible
[12:14] of course, I will come,
just don’t worry.
[12:17] Okay, okay. Bye.
[12:20] It was Ifrah,
[12:21] her grandmother has become my fan.
[12:28] God,
[12:30] how long is it going to take
for him to get ready?
[12:33] Well the man who takes so long in getting
ready will never succeed in his life.
[12:39] Yes Ifrah?
[12:41] I have been ready for so long,
[12:43] I am waiting for your best friend.
[12:45] Can you just call him again
and ask if he is ready?
[12:49] Strange.
[12:51] Here we go, Prince is here
[12:53] he is dressed up as if
he is going on dinner.
[12:57] Wow you came so early,
[12:58] only my feet are hurting yet,
you could've come after I fainted.
[13:04] Okay, okay I will fulfill this wish
of yours as well,
[13:07] now can we go?
[13:08] Or do you want to keep standing here?
[13:12] Take it easy,
[13:16] like this,
[13:17] it is a car, not a rickshaw.
[13:21] Calmly.
[13:36] The smell of a new car is just
out of this world.
[13:39] You should thank me
[13:42] that you're sitting in this car
because of me,
[13:44] lucky you are.
[13:46] Yes Of course when the car is
from father's hard-earned money
[13:51] then it feels even better.
[13:54] There is an entirely different joy
from father's money.
[13:57] You know how the saying goes,
nobody understands the value of free stuff.
[14:00] you've said something useless
exactly like your mind.
[14:06] Taking you because I'm forced to,
[14:08] only because of Ifrah I have let you
sit in my car.
[14:10] I am also going because of Ifrah,
[14:13] Ifrah’s sick Grandmother wants
to see me she is missing me.
[14:18] You know what,
[14:19] that once I meet someone they wish
to meet me again and again.
[14:23] Allah has given me such a personality
[14:25] But even once in my life
I get arrogant about it.
[14:27] yes your personality is just like that,
[14:30] cunning, clever and
excessive overacting.
[14:34] You make a fool out of people because
you are clever and act innocent.
[14:38] Be thankful to me that
I allowed you to sit with me,
[14:41] so just sit with your mouth shut.
[14:44] your voice sounds like someone
has burned my ears,
[14:48] I get a headache by listening to you.
[14:49] And listen
[14:50] I am taking you there,
[14:52] if I saw you trying to show fake love
to anyone you will see my anger.
[14:58] What is this fake love?
[14:59] Whoever I meet I meet them
wholeheartedly,
[15:02] don’t think of me like you.
[15:04] and who are you trying to scare?
I am not scared of anyone.
[15:09] I haven’t scared you yet,
[15:10] when I will scare you for real you
will run for your life.
[15:14] Looks like father’s scolding
was not enough for you
[15:16] that’s why you are still in attitude.
[15:18] Thank you for reminding me,
[15:20] apologize to Mona
when we will return.
[15:22] Wow,
[15:24] where did this Mona come from,
[15:27] listen I didn’t say anything to your Mona.
[15:30] I don’t even talk to her much,
[15:32] if she is in a bad mood
it is not because of me.
[15:36] Anyways look what love is,
[15:39] such an arrogant person became
mellow for his lover.
[15:45] Can’t even bear her anger, and.
[15:48] Wait a second,
[15:51] who are you calling my lover?
[15:53] Mona, who else?
[15:55] Your childhood love,
[15:56] well you can tell just by looking at her
that she is childhood’s mistake,
[16:00] people do get smarter by adulthood.
[16:02] and you?
[16:03] You are not even smart as an adult.
[16:05] Looks like you have done some sort
of specialization in stupidity.
[16:09] Don’t say her name
in front of me again.
[16:12] Did she fall from the sky?
[16:15] I shouldn’t be taking her name,
or blaming her.
[16:17] and you keep yelling at me?
[16:19] Making fun of me?
God will ask you about it.
[16:22] Shut up, I’m only doing this out of compulsion.
God please allow me to fix him.
[16:26] Shut up, shut up, shut up,
[16:27] I have to sit with you just
because of compulsion.
[16:54] Hey,
[16:57] how are you?
[16:58] Thank you so much for coming.
[17:00] Thank you Mahir, for bringing her here.
[17:02] I only brought her here because of
your grandmother’s wish.
[17:04] And please tell your grandmother
to make such illogical demands again.
[17:08] Actually Salik’s mother
visited unannounced
[17:13] and she cannot know that
you both are not engaged.
[17:16] That’s why you have to act like that.
[17:19] What?
What?
[17:20] What do you mean?
No, no.
[17:22] I am not in the mood of having
this relationship even as a joke.
[17:25] What are they going
to think about me?
[17:26] Such a nice girl and
such a bad choice.
[17:28] Oh hello?
What bad choice?
[17:30] Please, Rania.
Please, just for my sake.
[17:32] I was admiring you just this morning
with grandmother.
[17:35] If she finds out that you are single,
[17:37] she’ll definitely choose you
instead of me.
[17:40] Please save my home.
[17:44] Mahir, please convince her.
[17:50] Okay,
[17:52] just for the sake of your love,
I’ll choose this poison.
[17:56] Even thinking about it makes me
want to vomit.
[17:59] My heart feels weird.
[18:00] My heart and mind both are not right
at the moment.
[18:02] I would rather die than be
in a relationship with this man.
[18:05] Kill her.
[18:07] Rania, please just for my sake,
you won’t actually become his fiancé.
[18:10] God forbid, my fate is not that bad yet.
[18:13] Please explain to her.
[18:15] Just for your sake, just for you.
[18:18] I’ll tolerate this bitter person.
[18:19] But this is the last time, I won’t be
able to act like this again.
[18:22] Sure thing, it will never happen again.
[18:24] Thank you so much.
Now do one thing,
[18:26] exchange the rings.
[18:28] What?
[18:30] We’ll have to do this as well?
[18:31] I’ll have to give this ring to her?
[18:33] Ifrah.
[18:33] What can I do?
[18:35] You have to wear a ring to act like a fiancé.
Mahir, please.
[18:38] I’m doing this out of compulsion.
[18:41] Thank you.
[18:44] Bring your hand forward.
[18:46] See how she’s doing it.
Give it to me.
[18:48] Is it your hands or ginger?
[18:54] Look at her, how illiterate she is.
[18:56] She doesn’t even know the ring finger,
look she put it on my thumb.
[18:59] That’s exactly where illiterates like
you should wear it.
[19:02] Oh I am illiterate?
[19:03] And you’re a dean at some university?
[19:05] At least I’m smarter than you.
[19:07] Do not point fingers at me.
Do not raise your voice.
[19:10] Please make your mood better,
[19:12] Get in a better mood please, they’re waiting.
Now let’s go, please, without fighting.
[19:21] What?
[19:22] Why are you static?
Getting your picture clicked?
[19:24] Come on.
You go ahead.
[19:26] Come on.
Don’t touch me.
[19:29] Now come.
Move.
[19:32] Oh God.
[19:35] Don’t touch me.
[19:39] What happened?
They’re here.
[19:42] Thank God.
[20:00] They’d be here any minute.
What happened?
[20:03] They were right behind me.
[20:25] They’re here.
[20:27] Greetings, greetings, greetings.
[20:29] Greetings grandmother,
how are you?
[20:31] Greetings, live long my child.
You both have a long life,
[20:33] we were just talking about you.
[20:34] Oh. You haven’t met this girl yet?
[20:36] She’s such a good person,
her name is Rania.
[20:38] And she’s also Mahir’s fiance.
[20:40] Greetings.
Greetings, aunt, how are you?
[20:43] I’m good,
congratulations to both of you.
[20:45] Thank you, thank you.
[20:47] Thank you.
[20:50] Aunt, how are you?
[20:52] I’m absolutely fine.
[20:54] You should come here,
sit with me.
[20:56] Yes.
No, no, aunt,
[20:58] she loves me a lot.
[21:00] She gets shy and doesn’t
sit with anyone else.
[21:02] She won’t sit there.
How cute.
[21:04] Right?
[21:05] Rania you should visit often,
ask Ifrah how much I miss you.
[21:10] A lot.
[21:10] Don’t worry grandmother
if I’m here
[21:13] From now on it’s my responsibility
to bring her here.
[21:15] Right Rania? We’ll visit daily.
[21:19] Yes.
Promise?
[21:21] Promise.
Yes.
[21:22] So did you guys get engaged
in the childhood?
[21:25] No it’s.
[21:26] She’s lying, it’s aunt,
don’t hide it from her.
[21:30] I’ll tell you,
[21:31] actually we got engaged
in early childhood.
[21:35] Wouldn’t have I said no
if I were a grown-up?
[21:39] We just exchanged
the rings a while back.
[21:42] Now we only need your prayers.
[21:44] He likes to crack jokes.
[21:46] Oh,
[21:46] so that means you both got engaged
with the blessings of your elders.
[21:52] No.
Yes, yes, yes,
[21:54] that’s exactly how.
[21:57] Oh what are you doing love,
it’s all elders.
[22:00] Don’t do this in front of them,
it looks inappropriate.
[22:02] Please.
[22:04] Wow, such a cute romantic couple.
[22:08] It’s nothing like that brother Salik.
Oh she’s getting shy.
[22:12] She’s really shy,
[22:14] she acts like this in front of everyone.
[22:16] And she gets really embarrassed
[22:18] when she thinks about her activities
throughout the day, at night.
[22:22] She’s like that sometimes,
not a problem.
[22:25] How cute.
[22:26] We really don’t have such
shy girls in this generation.
[22:31] Ifrah, go and check
if the tea is served or not.
[22:35] Go.
I’ll also go with Ifrah.
[22:37] Oh she will manage,
you can take a seat.
[22:40] Let go of my hand.
[22:41] Complain a little more to my father.
[22:43] Let go of my hand.
[22:45] So, what is your plan for marriage?
[22:50] Aunt, I planned on completing
my education first.
[22:53] Then start a business and
then I’ll marry peacefully.
[22:56] But her? Impatient.
[22:59] She can’t wait,
[23:00] she wants to get married
even this evening.
[23:03] She’s insisting,
now what can I do?
[23:05] Can’t ignore her wishes.
[23:19] Tea is served,
please come.
[23:21] Yes, yes, yes, let’s go,
have some tea.
[23:23] Come on, have some tea.
[23:27] Hey please,
get going.
[23:30] Come.
[23:46] What happened Mahir,
[23:48] there is nothing on your plate.
You’re not eating anything?
[23:51] Do you want something?
[23:52] All of these are sweet.
[23:54] Yes sure, I’ll take some.
[23:56] Oh, I forgot Mahir,
[23:59] you didn’t have breakfast
or the lunch.
[24:01] What’s going to happen to me
if something ever happens to you?
[24:05] Offer him something.
[24:07] Here offer this.
[24:08] Yes aunt, I’m completely aware
of his likes and dislikes.
[24:11] This chocolate cake?
That’s his favorite.
[24:14] Then give him.
Right Mahir?
[24:16] I’ll get it for you,
[24:17] I’ll fill your plate and
you’ll have to finish it.
[24:20] Why are you taking that much?
[24:22] I won’t be eating all of that.
Do you know
[24:24] I bake this cake daily on his request,
I learnt it just for him.
[24:28] Really?
[24:30] The donut looks really appetizing,
we’ll have this as well.
[24:33] Donut as well?
[24:34] How colorful it is,
here you go.
[24:37] You have to eat all this,
hurry up.
[24:39] Yes, yes,
I’ll have it.
[24:42] Start eating. Eat.
[24:44] Yes, about to.
[24:46] Seems like he’s getting shy,
please tell him not to be formal.
[24:49] Yes.
Have it.
[24:53] That small of a bite?
Take a bigger bite, please.
[25:00] Good boy.
[25:04] Mahir, you’re really lucky.
[25:07] Where can you even find such
a caring and loving girl in this era?
[25:12] He says the same.
[25:13] He offers a prayer daily to thank God
that I’m in his life.
[25:18] He loves me so much,
[25:19] he doesn’t ignore anything that I say.
Right Mahir?
[25:22] And, oh, look at it.
[25:25] That’s why he’s not having the tea,
I didn’t add sugar.
[25:28] Exactly 4 teaspoons.
4 teaspoons?
[25:31] 1, 2, 3, 4.
[25:34] Here you have it, it’s hot.
[25:37] Have it or it’ll get bad.
[25:43] Oh, wait a second.
[25:49] He says it increases love.
[25:54] Aww.
[25:58] Here you have it, take a sip.
Have something.
[26:02] Did you see how loving he is?
[26:06] Do you know he loves me so much,
[26:08] sometimes I feel like I am living
in the old movies.
[26:11] He sometimes loves me so much
that I can’t even process it.
[26:13] If he could he’d sing for me
while hugging trees.
[26:17] He admires me so much,
[26:19] he says you’re so nice Rania,
you’re so intelligent.
[26:22] You should be the prime minister
of this country.
[26:25] By the grace of God,
[26:27] you’re not only smart
you’re beautiful as well.
[26:30] His life bloomed.
[26:32] Yes!
[26:33] Hey, you didn’t have the donut.
[26:36] See, I have to force him to eat everything.
Okay have a bite with my hands.
[26:39] It’s okay, I’m eating.
[26:40] With my hands please,
just a little.
[26:42] Just a little bit more,
open your mouth.
[26:44] Another, another bite.
[26:46] Good.
Okay, have it calmly.
[26:52] Mahir, value her a lot after marriage,
[26:55] take care of her,
and love her a lot.
[26:59] In this generation,
you can’t find a girl like this
[27:02] even if you look for them
with a searchlight.
[27:04] Right?
Right.
[27:05] She’s such a nice girl.
Yes, yes.
[27:12] Reach home, I’ll tell you.
[27:18] I’ll see you later.
[27:28] Why are you so boring?
[27:31] Play some music at least.
Stay quiet, “Play some music”.
[27:34] If you say another word,
[27:36] I’ll drop you off at the side
of the road right now.
[27:37] Oh hello? I’m not that useless.
[27:41] And don’t you remember
what Salik’s mother said?
[27:43] Value me.
[27:45] That’s how you value your fiance?
[27:46] Why did you lie to Salik’s mother
like that?
[27:49] Why did you tell her that
I’m crazy in your love?
[27:53] A guy like me being crazy for you?
[27:57] I don’t know what she must be
thinking about me.
[27:59] I can’t even look her in the eye.
[28:01] I’m embarrassed because of you.
[28:04] You can possibly get embarrassed?
[28:08] I don’t know what damned moment
it was when you met them.
[28:13] Okay now, stop it.
[28:15] How much are you going to cry?
I’m bored.
[28:17] You’re a trouble,
not a girl.
[28:20] What they must be thinking about me.
[28:22] And did you look at grandmother?
[28:24] She was admiring my fate.
[28:26] And fate like this.
[28:29] Let us reach home,
[28:30] I’ll tell everything to grandmother.
[28:33] Hey, calm down.
[28:35] If I tell her about your deeds
that you were doing.
[28:39] Holding hands, sitting close,
[28:42] you won’t be able to show your face
to anyone at home.
[28:45] Do you understand?
[28:46] People should look at themselves
before complaining.
[28:51] I’ve decided, from this day onwards
I’ll never take you anywhere with me.
[28:55] You’re not even worth taking you anywhere.
[28:58] Oh God, what did you just say?
[29:01] If you won’t take me anywhere,
[29:03] I’ll die in the confined walls of a house.
[29:08] No, please don't be so cruel.
Get lost.
[29:10] What do you think if you won't take me
anywhere so I won't be able to go anywhere?
[29:15] I know how to ride a bike,
[29:17] I know how to call a cab as well.
[29:19] And then why did I have a boy
as close as my brother?
[29:22] So I could rely on him.
And you know?
[29:25] What are you doing?
What are you doing, let go of my hand.
[29:28] I'm not leaving this ring with you.
Am I stealing it?
[29:29] Who knows about you,
[29:31] what if you sell it to get
two shirts for yourself?
[29:56] Open the door first.
[30:04] Hello madam.
[30:06] Aren't you a little too early?
[30:08] I don't know, didn't check the time.
[30:10] Yes, you must've not felt
the time passing, right?
[30:14] You're already educated enough,
[30:16] what are you going to do
by getting more education?
[30:18] What are you doing to do
by going to a university?
[30:20] You're speaking like
you're paying my fees.
[30:24] And what good is this illogical jealousy?
[30:27] You've ruined yourself,
look at your face.
[30:29] You look even older
than my mother.
[30:32] Take back your words.
[30:35] I don't take back anything.
[30:40] Well whatever you say
doesn't matter to me.
[30:42] Why are you so proud of yourself?
What even are you?
[30:47] Ask this question to Mahir,
[30:49] and he'll tell you in detail, okay?
[30:58] You are back?
Do you care about anyone?
[31:01] At least care about your best friend,
[31:04] you don't care about me at all that
someone is here for you.
[31:07] And I'm seeing that
you are blindfolded.
[31:10] You don't care about me.
[31:12] Look, Mona, I'm already too tired.
[31:15] I don't know.
[31:16] Can I listen to all your complaints
tomorrow?
[31:19] Really?
[31:21] Go away,
[31:22] you'll only get back your senses
when your hands will be empty.
[31:27] I got back my senses today.
[31:33] Such sugary tea,
[31:35] I've eaten so much of deserts
that I still feel weird.
[31:40] I'm not letting Rania get away.
[31:43] Okay listen, do you know,
[31:45] she insulted me a lot, talk to her.
[31:48] Does she respect anyone?
She insults everyone.
[31:52] It must be someone really fortunate
if she respects him.
[31:55] Hey?
[31:57] Nobody listens to me,
nobody takes me seriously.
[32:02] Now I'm up against this Rania.
[32:05] I'll snatch Mahir away from her.
[32:07] I'll let her know,
that I am Mona.
[32:25] Children,
[32:28] I can't see your sister,
is she not home?
[32:30] She's at home.
What does it mean,
[32:32] does she not know I'm here yet?
[32:34] I don't know.
[32:35] Can you please hurry, we have to go
for ice cream today with sister Rania.
[32:39] Oh, that's a really good idea.
[32:41] You won't be going there alone,
I'll join you.
[32:44] Not only me,
but we will take Rabail as well,
[32:46] she stays home all the time,
she's naive.
[32:48] Okay, so call sister Rabail.
[32:52] Her number is also switched off,
where is she?
[32:54] Here you go, your tea.
[33:05] Sister Rabail, today we're all going
for ice cream
[33:08] and sir Farhad suggested that
you should come with us.
[33:12] Me?
[33:13] How can I go?
[33:15] Just like how we are going.
But mother.
[33:17] I'm teaching these devil's spawn just to get
a reflection of yours, getting my life together.
[33:23] You can't come to get the ice cream?
[33:25] How will you spend your life?
[33:27] I'll spend it but convince
my family before that.
[33:31] That's exactly what I'm doing,
[33:32] I'm doing all this because of you,
and love makes us do all this.
[33:37] Oh God,
[33:38] so many people are sitting here
[33:40] and none of you cared that
water is wasting for so much.
[33:43] The country got into this situation just
because of the insensitivity of people like you.
[33:50] Really? If you could you’d shoot us
with a canon.
[33:57] Yes not a bad idea,
[33:59] we have to do this for 3-4,
[34:01] only then the rest will understand.
[34:02] And you will be the first.
[34:05] Why me? I’m such a harmless person.
[34:07] You know what you should do?
Write Mahir’s name.
[34:10] The world already has a lot of them,
the world would be better off.
[34:14] This is not a bad idea.
[34:20] What’s happening here?
[34:22] What’s happening here?
[34:24] We’re chatting and having a good time,
nothing of your concern.
[34:28] There are books in front
of the children,
[34:30] who’s teaching them?
[34:36] You should be ashamed,
all of you should be ashamed.
[34:39] Brother Maheer we’re going for ice cream,
do you want to join?
[34:41] No one is going anywhere,
sit here.
[34:45] And Rabail, go inside, go get inside.
[34:50] Okay now, let’s continue the class,
take out your books.
[34:53] And madam Rania, please
it’s time for them to study,
[34:55] you can go inside.
[34:56] Is this the time for ice cream?
Not at all.
[34:58] Okay now, take out your books.
Sit properly.
[35:00] Hey, what?
[35:07] I was joking in front of him.
[35:10] Shut up, you liar,
[35:12] I don’t want a selfish friendship like this,
[35:14] how can you be my brother?
[35:16] Please try to understand,
it’s a delicate matter,
[35:19] he’s my future brother-in-law.
I was setting a better image.
[35:21] And ruined mine in the process, right?
[35:26] Now you’ll see,
I’ll stop your visits at the house.
[35:31] I don’t want a selfish brother.
[35:33] But I want a beautiful sister like you.
[35:35] Why are you forcing it?
[35:38] I have to, you know once you make
a relation with someone, it stays.
[35:47] Insulted me in front of Mahir.
[35:52] I’m apologizing.
[35:54] Hold the ears.
Whose? Yours?
[35:56] Yours.
[35:58] Sorry, here you go,
okay now?
