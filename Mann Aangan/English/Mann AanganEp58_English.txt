Did you go to meet your family?
Actually..
How dare you set foot out of this house without asking me.
I just wanted to meet...
You cannot meet your sisters. Do you understand?
But why?
I don't find it necessary to answer your questions.
They're my sisters and its my right to meet them.
You will not decide this. 
I'm warning you. Don't you dare set foot out of this house without my permission 
or else you'll see the worse of me.
It seems you don't understand the language of love. 
I'll have to teach you the other way.
No.
I'll do as you say. I'll not leave the house without your permission. Never.
I'll do as you say. I'll do as you want.
I don't want to be harsh with you. 
Even I don't like it myself. 
what shall I do?
People who interfere in my life, I don't like them. 
Just forget your sisters.
And understand this well. 
I don't like girls who cry and weep. 
This is your last day of weeping like this.
This shouldn't happen again. 
This is a house not a graveyard. Nobody should be mourning here all the time.
Do you understand?
That's good.
Any problem?
No. Why would I have a problem? 
I'm made of stone.
I don't feel pain and I'm not affected by someone's attitude as well.
Even I feel the same about myself. 
You complain that people think you're made of stone 
and I want to be made of stone.
I'm tired of being a human and feeling all the pain. I'm fed up.
Should I ask you something?
Do you really think I have a relation with Wasay?
What does my thinking mean? The truth will not change.
Is our relation so weak
 that you assumed so many things just looking at me with Wasay? 
You didn't even give me a chance to explain.
I didn't assume anything 
but circumstances..
Are you doubting me?
No. I'm not doubting you.
You don't trust me this is why you're reacting on such a small thing.
Is it so small for you? That person and you..
You loved that person.
Faraz I...
Did you love him?
Yes I did. But I am no longer with him.
He wasn't important to me then nor is he important to me now.  
Had this been, why would I marry you? Wasay told me,
he told me I could come back to him whenever I wanted but I didn't do that 
because I didn't want to leave you.
You met him?
And you didn't tell me. Why?
What difference does it make? 
I meet 50,000 people everyday. Do I tell you about everyone?
I didn't tell you about Wasay because I didn't want to hurt you. 
I knew it that you will mind & he isn't so important to me.
brother Saqlain knowingly sent Wasay to my office.
 I don't know what he told him just to create misunderstandings between us.
And your attitude.. it has proven that brother Saqlain is successful in his motive. 
He wanted to create a rift between us and he did it.
Your attitude has made me realize that all the time that I was with you, I was just wasting my time.
Because you have always supported me but you never trusted me.
If you can stop trusting me on one such small thing, 
then I think we don't have any reason to continue this relationship.
Ever since I'm with you, ever since I got married to you, I've tried my best 
to make a place for myself in your heart. 
I stood by the relationship with all my loyalties.
But you.. 
you couldn't even trust me
Where there is no trust Faraz..
relationships don't sustain here.
You're expecting. My guess cannot be wrong.
 I know its a very big news for you, that's why I haven't shared this with your husband
I have finally received the news I had been waiting for so many years. 
But along with that, why did you tilt my world over, God?
Oh God, should I be happy today or should I cry for the deceit?
Salma?
Yes brother Saqlain sir? Did you call me?
Why didn't you serve food?
Everything is ready, I'll just serve in a bit.
But Areeba is sleeping, isn't she?
Yes she is sleeping.
Don't serve dinner yet. I'll eat with Areeba when she wakes up.
Alright then.
I'm going out for some work. Stay with Areeba. Don't leave her alone.
Yes. Don't worry. I'm here.
Areeba mam you're up?
Where is Saqlain?
He just left.
Are you going somewhere?
Yes. I'll just come.
You're looking very nice today
And this?
This too.
Who could be here at this hour?
I don't know who it might be. I'll just go and see.
Why would you go and see? I'm here. I'll go and see.
What if its Rameez? 
Oh God what will happen now?
Saqlain who is it?
This is the same girl that..
but you said she was lying.
I didn't lie to you.
I am Saqlain's wife.
Saqlain, didn't you tell her? Come on tell her who am I to you?
Yes she is my wife. I have married her.
Such a big lie 
Such a big deceit.
I thought you were not a human being 
but an angel and you..
I didn't cheat you. I got married for the second time. I have a right to do so.
And that I did because you're a barren woman.
I'm not a barren woman.
I am not a barren woman and neither am I not expecting today.
I am pregnant.
Areeba.. this..
Areeba..
Saqlain she's lying to you. She's fooling you. 
How can it be after so many years?
Areeba doesn't lie to me. Ever. 
These lab reports are from the place where I got her tested from. How can these be fake?
Fake reports can be made in a couple of thousands.
No. This cannot be. This cannot be..
Saqlain where are you going? Saqlain? Saqlain listen to me.
Saqlain she's lying. She's fooling you.
What happened Fariya?
Areeba is expecting. 
Its all because of you. If only I hadn't listened to you.
Please come inside.
I'm very angry. Leave me.
 Its all because of you. I shouldn't have listened to you.
Come inside please.
What is it? Mahnoor why are you not answering the call?
Its an unknown number.
Let me talk.
No. Why would you talk? Its an unknown number. I'll just hang up.
You're not happy in your life. Your eyes are telling me Mahnoor.
They say you're suffering too much.
Saqlain, you didn't tell her. Come on tell her who am I?
Yes. She's my wife.
I married her.
I found it in your coat pocket. Who is it for?
I wanted to surprise you since so many days.
And as it is, who would I buy jewelry, if not for you?
When I wanted the number of your Hyderabad office, I found out it didn't exist?
If the receptionist told you there's no office, it means I'm lying?
Do you think if I want to cheat you I'd go to Hyderabad? 
Come I'll show you the office and give you the number.
I don't want to go anywhere.
Why did Areeba switch off the phone?
Nobody is answering at home as well. I hope everything is alright.
sister Mahnoor?
Yes.
Please come and eat. Dinner is served.
No I'm not hungry. You go and eat.
Why aren't you hungry? The food was cooked late. Please come.
I don't feel like. I am feeling a bit unwell.
Oh, what happened to you?
Its nothing. I think its the weather.
What happened? I'll tell mom and get you medicine.
Please don't tell anyone. They'll be worried.
Do one thing, have dinner with everyone. I'm fine.
Alright then. Okay.
What is the problem? Why isn't anybody answering me? 
How should I find out?
Areeba, listen to me. Areeba? Areeba? Listen.
Areeba? Areeba? Open the door. Areeba.
Areeba open the door and listen to me. Whats wrong with you?
What sin did I commit? I just married for the second time. Its nothing out of the world.
And what will crying get you? 
Your condition isn't favorable for this. Take care of your health.
Areeba, listen to me..
Areeba, lets sit and talk. Nothing should happen to our child. Please listen to me.
Areeba.. Areeba, listen to me.
Alright, don't open the door.
Don't talk to me if you don't want to. I'll leave. I'm leaving.
Didn't Mahnoor come?
She said she isn't hungry.
Its surprising if she isn't hungry yet when will she be? Faraz?
Go and call her.
If she didn't come when Aima called, why would she come with me?
Now I truly believe that something is going on between you two.
Mahnoor has been quiet since a few days and she is worried and her eyes are wet ever since she came home today.
See Faraz.. The complaints you have with one another.
Sit and talk it out. Dear don't hurt each other.
Go dear and call her to have dinner with us.
Mom I don't think she is worried because of Faraz.
What do you mean?
I mean there could be issues between them but she is worried about something else as well.
Maybe she is worried because of her sister. Maybe because of Ramsha. 
Because when I went to her room she was very tensed and calling someone.
I'll get water from the kitchen.
You have complaints with me then why are you venting out on food?
Or.. 
do you want to tell everybody about our personal issues?
We have differences between us.
 But everybody is waiting for you on the dinner table.
I'm not hungry. Really.
Why?
What did you have for lunch?
Lunch?
I didn't even remember lunch.
Where did you go from the office in the morning?
 You left without telling anyone.
Did you go to meet someone?
You must be thinking that I went to meet Wasay.
 But its alright. 
Once you start doubting someone, you always think like that.
If you would have told me where you were going or for what,
 I wouldn't have thought about it. But you didn't so this is what I thought.
Where did I lack in our relationship
 that I haven't earned your trust by now?
If not on my character, you should have trusted your love.
A girl who you stood by on every difficult step of life, how can she be disloyal to you?
Mahnoor I.. I was thinking that a girl like you..
Mahnoor, a woman left me for a rich man.
 She turned me down and made a spectacle of my respect.
You didn't find a difference between her and I?
You thought if she could be disloyal to you, I could be too?
Did you hear what Wasay said?
I did but did he say what I had said?
Whatever he said, you heard him. But did you even hear what I answered him?
Without listening to me, without hearing my answers, you decided what I wanted to do? 
You didn't even give me a chance to explain?
I made a mistake.
You made a mistake? 
But why were you punishing me?
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
What should I say then?
I agree I made a mistake. 
Now you tell me what should I do?
 Should I hold my ears? Please forgive me now.
I'm sorry.
Sir, I kept knocking for a long time but mam Ramsha didn't open the door.
Did you tell her that I was waiting for her at the dinner
Yes I did but she said no.
Alright. You go.
Okay.
Open the door Ramsha..
