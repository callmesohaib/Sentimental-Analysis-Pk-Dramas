Is anything left behind?
Oh! The sweets are still here.
Tell Maheer to place it in the car!
Mother! it's getting late! Let's go.
Let Faraz come! He is getting ready. Why are you in so much hurry?
Brother is finally here.
You look so nice!
My son is looking so good.
Looking like a prince.
May god keep you safe from evil eye.
I'll ask Maheer to place the sweets in car.
I'm so happy.
May god bless you with a good family.
Are you happy son?
Yes mother! I'm happy.
You should be happy! This marriage is of your choice.
If you are happy! I'm happy too.
What about the brides gift?
Brides gift?
1 million!
Mahnoor's bridal gift is 1 million rupees.
1 million?
1 million is too much! We were thinking..
You would be thinking of a cheap amount.
But we don't accept that!
That's why Mahnoor's bridal gift will be 1 million rupees. It's time!
You are right! Bridal gift will be according to your demand. 1 million rupees.
Right it! 1 million.
1 million.
Hello!
Hi!
May I ask you that what are you doing here?
I was here to ask the same that what are you doing here!
Come on! It's my elder brother's wedding.
Don't tell me! It's my sister's wedding.
Really?
Yeah! This means that my sister Mahnoor is marrying your elder brother Faraz?
We were friends before but now we are family friends.
That's such a good thing! Let's go on the stage. Nikkah is about to start.
Sure! You go, I'll come.
Make it quick.
Fine.
Quick! Take out the money. The money! Sister tell him about it.
Yes sure!
Maheer!
Here!
How much is this?
This is just 5k! I need at least..
100k !
Don't you remember that you and Mahnoor took 100k from me.
If can't give it, then I'll give it to her.
She demanded money from me. I'll be the one to give it to her.
Se is asking 100k.
She won't take less.
You won't have such amount right now.
Don't worry! I'll give it to her. Here! 100k.
Here! Now drink this milk.
Sister in law! Sit here on the couch.
Why are you forcing her to sit here? Take her to the room of Faraz.
Mother! Mahnoor has to eat the sweets and we have to enjoy the moments.
It's already to late! This is not the time for such foolish acts.
Take her in the room.
Mahnoor would be tired too.
Fine!
Don't you think that you insulted Faraz a lot.
Did I insult him? You think that was insult?
I wanted to act as his friend! I gave the money from my own that was demanded from him.
You should not have given the money.
Because Rimsha didn't even demand 100k.
She didn't demand a proper amount.
She also knew that her demand won't be fulfilled by him.
They would've felt bad about it! It might affect Mahnoor's presence in that house.
Why are you so worried about Mahnoor? You were against this proposal like a week ago.
Mahnoor didn't listen to you! She married Faraz by her own choice.
You a right but she is married now, and we should not make some misunderstanding for them in the start of their marriage.
It can drag some difficulties in the relation. You should think about it.
Now you'll blame me just like Mahnoor did?
It's fine.
The family that you belong to, I should not expect anything but arrogance.
I was just normally speaking.
Don't say a word!
I'm the one who was looking after the arrangements of your sister's wedding from so many days.
And now that it has ended! You have started taunting me. Very nice.
No! I'm not taunting. I was just speaking with you. Where are you going? I won't speak anymore.
This is just 5k! I need at least..
100k! Don't you remember that you and Mahnoor took 100k from me?
If you can't give it to her! I'll give her the money myself from your side.
Faraz! I apologize for Saqlain's behavior.
Leave the apologies to the side.
Whatever he did and what was the intensity, I know it really well.
You should not worry at all! You should forget about your worries from today because I'll handle them.
I just want to see you happy and smiling.
I promise you that I won't ever leave you alone.
It's good.
I'll be with you forever.
Mother!
Mother! What did you do?
Who acts like this? You didn't even let her eat the sweets and she couldn't enjoy with me.
I did alright.
I myself reached home with so much negativity on my mind.
The torture I went through and waited for the bridal departure.
The disrespect we went through! We should have rejected the marriage on the spot and left her on the spot.
This is wrong mother! You shouldn't talk like this.
Whatever her brother in law did. Was that right?
First he chose the bridal gift himself.
And after that he insulted Faraz.
What did Mahnoor do wrong in all of this?
No! It's my fault that I listened to Faraz and brought her home a his bride.
He is getting disrespected! And we are too.
I said it! She didn't bring the dowry.
There's no importance of dowry for them! But the bridal gift..
They chose 1 million!
Mother! Why are you getting mad?
It's not the time for dowry anymore! People bring cash thee days.
Didn't you see the wedding arrangements? It was worth millions.
It was not for us! They wanted to show off.
Whatever! I'm happy that Faraz got married to Mahnoor as she is so well educated.
She is bank for us! She is the boss of Faraz in office. Why are you worrying about dowry?
Like she'll hand over her pay to me every month.
Mother! Why are you taking tension?
Faraz still hands his pay over to you, right? This house is maintained by Faraz and he does everything from his expense.
You are good in both states.
Don't disturb the peace in this house for nothing.
Mother! Why are you still up? You should sleep.
I cannot sleep darling! I'm missing Mahi.
The house feels so empty without her.
Only some hours have past right now.
It feels so weird! You remember that before her marriage we used to fight a lot.
Now this room feels so quite.
Whatever happened before her departure! I'm thinking about it and stressing.
Saqlain shouldn't have said something like that at such moment! Faraz and his family would've later blamed Mahi.
What happened? He got insulted too. You know that it's the behavior of Saqlain.
He tries to act tough and wealthy so that he can insult the one in front of him.
If we think! The money that Saqlain gave me actually belongs to us.
You! You should call Mahi! Ask her that is everything fine!
Mother! It's 2 am.
I don't think that this is a suitable time to call sister.
Fine! You should sleep now. I disturbed you.
Good night!  Good night!
Go and sleep.
Here! It's for you.
Thank you!
It might not please you but I bought it for you in love.
I can see your love!
I don't care about the value of the gift.
I was really nervous at night that I forgot to give you the gift.
You said so much at night.
I want to share something with you too. You might not know everything about my past.
But whatever happened! I cannot change it.
But I'm responsible for my future.
I want you to trust me.
That our relation might not be full of love.
But this relation will have honesty in it.
I'll try my best to spend a faithful life with you.
You won't complain.
Believe me! A day will come when you'll start to love me too.
And I'll wait for that day.
Rimsha!
Yes?
How long will it take you? We are getting late.
Just 5 more minutes.
Mahi would be waiting! Areeba and Saqlain haven't reached yet.
I've got somethings ready but Saqlain said that he'll bring the breakfast.
Then why are you scolding me?
You should go and call Saqlain! How would we go there if he isn't here.
Fine! I'll call him.
Yes! Do it.
Greetings mother!
Greetings!
Areeba! Where are you guys? You haven't reached yet. We have to take breakfast to Mahi's home.
Mother! He is asleep right now. You know that he was so tired the whole night.
What? he is sleeping?
He said it himself that he'll bring the breakfast. How should I manage now?
Mother! Leave it. Mahnoor's family in law can get their own breakfast. 
Areeba! It's a good act after marriage.
I told Mahi that I'll do such a thing! What will she think?
Mother! You are just worried about Mahnoor only. You don't care about me?
I'm not waking him up! He was already mad at night.
You should go to Mahnoor's house yourself with breakfast. You can do whatever you like. I don't care.
Areeba! Hello! Hello Areeba.
What happened?
Saqlain is not coming?
No! He is sleeping.
Fine! We go through public transport. I'll book a ride!
We'll go by ourselves?
Nothing happens! We can take the breakfast with us to their house too. I'll book a ride. You should wait.
It's coming in 5 minutes. Hurry!
Let me pack the things I made.
Do it quick.
Wow! Its so annoying.
So much time has passed. There no sign of Mahnoor's family.
last night her mother was promising to send the breakfast! How can they do such acts when they cannot send dowry with her.
I'll have to arrange the breakfast myself! Arnah!
Arnah come here!
Yes!
Darling you should..
Greetings!   Greetings!   Greetings!
You woke up late today?
We woke up early mother! We were just talking to each other.
What's the plan for breakfast today?
Your wifes family had to bring the breakfast today! I think that their intentions have hanged now.
I'll get the breakfast ready now! Go and tell Maheer to bring bread and eggs.
No! Something special should be presented for the breakfast today. I'll go get a dish everyone loves. I'll be back.
I'll go make something too.
Sister in law! Why are you standing there? Come and sit here. Relax!
Did you like the house?
It's beautiful.
Listen!
Listen!
Get up! It's late.
What's the time?
It's 10:30 ! Mother called me.
She was saying that you had to take breakfast to Mahnoor's home! I told her that there's no need and you are sleeping.
You did right.
It was your sister's wedding and now I should take breakfast to their home too?
Make me a cup of tea!
I cannot believe it that we are having a breakfast so late today.
Bring some more too.
Do the breakfast!
Take this too!
She can take everything herself!
You should sit and do breakfast yourself too. Ask Maheer to come and join us. I have to take my medicines too.
Should I give you something?
No! thank you. You should eat.
Who came now? Go!
Ask Maheer to check the door and do breakfast with us.
Its your house! Your kitchen!
What's the big deal! Its good that I can spend some time with you.
How are you darling?
I'm fine!
Why did you guys get so late? I was waiting for you.
Actually Saqlain didn't come! I apologize that we got late.
Aunt you should not apologize! You did so much for us today. There was no need.
We did need this fun for our good hearts! Its nothing! This'll make Mahi happy!
You should eat please!
Not like this. Rimsha! Bring the breakfast quickly.
I'm coming!
Seriously?
Its nothing! Help me with it.
What is Rimsha doing in the kitchen? I've to talk to her too.
She is helping in the kitchen to get it arranged.
She is such a bad actor! Now she has came to make some fuss. 
Are you still busy today or you want to meet me?
what's the password?
I brought clothes for you.
What is this all?
It's all for you!
Me? I didn't need it. You should have not.
This all is sent by mother for you!
She sent it with love! I hope you'll like it.
I'll call her and thank her.
I have to give this to aunt! I'll go give it to her.
Aunt! Should I come in?
Come!
What is this medicine about? Are you alright?
It's medicine for blood pressure.
I'm having a headache.
I've been so fatigued by the arrangements of the wedding.
Whatever! Tell me why did you come here?
Mother sent some gifts for you.
What was the need for all of this? They should have given you something for your use.
Watch? Who is this for?
Its for you! Mother sent it.
No way! For me? Thank you! It look so good.
Here! This necklace is for you!
Aunt! These are for you. Clothes too.
I hope that you'll like everything!
Fine!
You didn't need to! But Thank you!
I'll go now.
Is it real?
