Come Ramsha
Have dinner with us.
Take it
Thanks
Have it Ramsha.
Hmm
How is food brother Toqeer?
Hmm
Hmm
It's very delicious.
The food is delicious, sister.
Thanks
No matter what relationship I have with Aima, but she is your daughter.
Do you want Aima to live all his live in such a relation where neither she gets love nor respect.
Rather, she was humiliated jokingly and she silently bear that.
Faraz
Hmm
Whatever you will discuss with Yasir
Do it very calmly and patiently.
It's obvious.
I am not inviting here to fight.
I want the same thing that nothing goes wrong which cause any fight.
Neither Aima has told you this nor Aunt.
If anything goes wrong then everyone will feel that I...
Don't worry.
I have no intention to say anything harsh to him.
Nor I am so foolish.
I will discuss everything calmly
OK
You have your exam day after tomorrow.
Yes
You know but you are not revising.
I have made all preparation which I could.
I feel that
We shouldn't study more just before exam instead we should prepare much earlier.
OK
But God willing you will definitely succeed.
God willing.
How is your tour going on and how do you find our city, brother Toqeer?
It's like that.
Anyways, if you need anything, don't hesitate and call me immediately.
Yes of course.
We will meet soon.
Please inform me.
Of course
Bye
Listen
Look at this.
Mr. Toqeer gave this gift to me.
I didn't open last night. I just opened it, it seems very expensive.
Brother Toqeer has a big heart.
He is very close to me and trusts me a lot.
He gives millions of rupees blindly without even asking the reason.
He didn't even lost a single rupee.
I am sure
You can never betray a trust.
I like this gift.
Yes it is good.
Sister Ariba
Bye
Bye
Bye, brother Saqlain.
Bye
I am just coming.
Ramsha listen to me.
Yes
You told Ariba that you need pocket money.
Yes I need pocket money.
You should have told me.
I got busy in my work and didn't pay attention to give you some amount.
Take it.
Check whether you need more then I will give you.
No
It's enough.
Thank you.
OK, tell me if you need money.
Now go, your van driver is anxiously ringing the horn.
He will disturb whole neighborhood for no reason.
OK bye.
Go
I want to talk to you.
Yes go ahead
I don't know why but I feel that we should arrange Ramsha's marriage.
Is there everything OK?
Yes, everything is fine.
Ramsha is indeed a great responsibility for us. 
Taking care of her till her studies completion
Look
We are living here because of her instead of living in our house.
I am not living for myself anymore.
I am worried about Ramsha all the time.
And my treatment has also stopped.
After mom's departure, so many problems arise.
If I live with these tensions.
How will I be treated?
Is this what you really wanted to talk about, Ariba?
Or is there something done wrong by Ramsha which you are trying to hide from me.
Because Mahnoor came yesterday and was fighting with Ramsha.
And Ramsha almost about to scratch her hairs.
Is everything OK?
There is no such thing.
I don't know why they were fighting with each other.
I don't have a discussion with Mahnoor.
She has misbehaved with you so much.
I don't like at all that she misbehaves with you.
Hey what happened? She is your sister.
That day you were begging me to forgive her then what happened now?
I want you to forgive her and
And end any bitterness between both of you..
Listen
Ramsha is not only our responsibility.
And Mahnoor will meet her outside home.
And God forbid.
If anything goes wrong.
Then I will be held responsible that I didn't monitor Ramsha properly.
Ariba, you know your sisters better than me.
It doesn't matter whether you monitor Ramsha or not.
But
Ramsha is under Mahnoor's influence.
And I am sure that she is not less than Mahnoor.
Time will reveal this secret.
You have become more worried than me.
What else can I do?
A gentleman is afraid of disgrace and shame.
Anyways
We will think about it when time comes.
No need to worry at the moment.
And don't worry, Everything will be better.
I will put it in cupboard.
Hmm
Your tea must also get cold.
Let me make fresh tea.
OK
How long will Mahnoor cover it up?
And Faraz is the mastermind.
First he married Mahnoor.
On the other hand he asked his brother to follow Ramsha.
It means that two sisters in one house.
What a plan?
But I won't let that happen at any cost.
Mahnoor doesn't want this to happen.
That's why they were fighting.
This shouldn't end.
Then
What should I do?
How is everyone at home?
Everyone is fine.
Good.
And
When will your father come back to Pakistan?
His plan is for next month.
I see.
You have invited me especially?
Mom told me that you want to have a meeting with me.
Yes
Are you angry with us?
No
Mom called you three of four times but you didn't receive. I also called you but you didn't receive my call.
Then mom sent text message to your mother.
All this shows that you are angry with us for some reason.
I am not angry with you brother Faraz.
Then are you angry with Aima?
Because I have heard that
You and Aima talk less and fight more.
I don't have a quarrelsome nature.
But if someone doesn't understand my point then I get irritated.
And Aima is very stupid in this matter.
Actually she is a bit dumb.
She takes time to understand.
Aima is your fiance.
You are about to get married in few days.
And using such words for your future life partner is not a good thing to do.
You and Aima should give respect to each other.
A relationship in which there is no respect is completely hollow and weak.
You have given me such a long lecture brother Faraz.
I am sorry if you feel bad that I called you sister stupid.
I was just joking.
Exactly.
I was thinking the same way that it was just a joke.
Anyway, leave this topic.
Yes Aunt.
Tell me what is your favorite dish? I will cook that for you.
Anything special made by Aima.
Yes
Hey
How are you brother Toqeer?
So early in the mornging.
How are you?
I am fine.
Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Why did you bother to come here? If you told me, I would have come.
I want something.
That's why I came here.
The thirsty will go to the well, but the well will not come to the thirsty.
You need something from me. Order me.
Saqlain, you are like a brother to me.
This is your greatness.
Thanks a lot.
You reminded me regarding factory that day, otherwise I forgot that project.
But you mentioned that so I thought about starting a new project.
But I am really busy.
You don't have to worry about that. I am here with you.
Yes
You are always with me.
Rather, I was thinking of making you my partner in the new factory.
Brother Toqeer, who can I become your partner?
Why not?
We will work together.
Do you accept?
Yes, of course.
It would be an honor for me to work as a partner with you.
Thank you so much.
I am sorry, I haven't asked you whether you will take coffee or tea?
Coffee would be nice.
Sure
Send two really good coffees in my room quickly.
Immediately.
Brother Toqeer, kindly tell me how much will be the budget of the factory?
Why are you worried about the budget?
I will invest the whole amount.
That's fine.
But
But you will have to give me a favor.
Order me brother Toqeer.
Your sister in law
What is her name?
Ramsha
She is so cute.
Ramsha is younger sister of my wife, brother Toqeer.
Please don't think anything wrong about her.
No, no.
I am not thinking bad.
I want to marry her.
You want to marry Ramsha?
But she is too young and
I don't think her sisters will agree with this proposal otherwise
I have no objection with this proposal.
So, convince them.
Convince them.
Brother
I am offering you partnership in my new factory.
You will have to do that much for me.
The deal is not bad.
Tell me if you accept this.
Done?
Done.
Hundred percent.
Just give me some days.
OK
Hi Faria.
What's up Rameez.
Where are you Faria?
Neither you are receiving my phone nor your are meeting with me.
I came to your home but Aunt said to me...
I have told you that Saqlain knows everything.
How did he know?
It was my mistake.
He heard me while I was talking to you on phone.
How would I tell you what happened to me?
Didn't he beat you?
He has beaten me so much.
But I told him.
That it's enough. Give me divorce.
But that bad man is sticking on his stance that he will not divorce me.
What will we do Faria?
Both of us.
Wait for some time Rameez.
I am thinking about taking divorce from court.
I can't do anything as I have nothing at the moment.
What about the amount which he gave you for business?
He took that amount back.
Oh
And he is planning to grab you as well.
He will file a case against you for stealing his money and get you arrested by police.
What?
How can he file a false case against me, Faria?
Saqlain can do anything Rameez, you don't know him.
He is very sharp and cunning.
Why don't you do one thing?
Leave this city and go somewhere else for few days.
But where?
Rameez, go anywhere.
You don't know he is very sharp and cunning and he will trap you and
police will arrest you, why don't you understand?
Listen
We will keep be in contact.
As soon as I get free from Saqlain, I will come to you.
But please leave this city now.
It would be best for you.
OK fine
Let me do this.
Take care of yourself.
And stay in contact with me.
OK
Bye
What happened? Why are you laughing?
Oh my God.
He is still a stupid.
He agrees without hesitation whatever I say.
I am having ache in my abdomen due to laughing.
Well tell me.
Have you asked him to run away?
He has run away.
What next?
I have planned for future.
Toqeer takes decision very quickly. 
I got an idea from his behavior yesterday.
His offer is not bad.
With his support I can get ownership of both properties of Ramsha.
Toqeer won't have any interest in that.
But it can be.
Ramsha won't agree.
It is not easy to convince Ariba and Mahnoor as well.
Wait here, I am just coming.
Here is your phone.
Has this been repaired?
I told you that you will get your phone today.
So you got it.
Thank you so much.
Welcome.
Shall we go?
Let's go.
Wait, let me start the bike.
Do you think mom that Yasir is a perfect person for Aima?
Yes
What's wrong with him?
He earns well and belongs to a well off family.
But he should have manners as well.
He was insulting my sister in front of me.
Oh
All of you have stuck on same point.
You have advised Yasir.
I firmly believe.
That he must have understood the meaning and purpose of your words.
Didn't you see how apologetically he said that he was joking.
Faraz
I think Aunt is right.
I think brother Yasir has understood this.
We didn't really like his way of talking with Aima.
And did you see his behavior?
How decently he was talking to Aima.
I think we should leave this and move forward by forgetting it.
Mahnoor is absolutely right.
Let's leave this topic.
Rather I was thinking about
going to his house within next week or so and discuss regarding fixing marriage.
The longer the delay, the more misunderstandings will increase.
Some time this delay proves to be God's blessing for man.
The personalities that are not exposed in a short time are exposed due to delay.
Anyway, I am not satisfied.
I was confused from the start but now I am sure.
Are you OK?
All good? Is everything fine?
Sister Mahnoor came to our house yesterday.
She scolded me so much that I can't tell you.
You were saying that brother Faraz didn't ask you anything.
Sister Mahnoor told me that she has fought with brother Faraz because of me.
Hey
He is like that.
You know broher Faraz.
He is a gentle and spiritual guy.
But
But sorry to say you sister is so clever.
She is your sister but
What is true is true.
Didn't you see that how did she embarrassed my by hiding ring? 
And brother Faraz were considering me as a liar.
He accused me of theft.
He searched me.
But what can I do?
She is being doing all this.
Brother Faraz didn't say anything to me initially.
But when sister in law told a lie against me then
Brother Faraz got angry with me.
Mom also got to know.
But by doing so she has provided me an advantage.
I didn't had to tell anything about you to anybody.
Sister in law told that.
And my problem got solved automatically.
Now everybody knows.
That I love you and want to marry you.
Really?
Hmm
And I have told sister clearly.
That there is no need for you to dictate me.
I mean it's my life so I will live it as I wish.
Good.
Hmm
It's your life so live it as you wish.
There is no need to be afraid of anyone..
I am wth you.
But I am very afraid of brother Saqlain.
Thank God that sister didn't tell anything to brother Saqlain yesterday.
Otherwise, I would...
Earlier you were afraid of sister.
And now you are afraid of brother Saqlain.
How did it came between both of us?
Let's do one thing.
We should run away.
We should run away?
Where and how?
There are so many places.
We will get married after we run away.
Then we will return home, Nobody will say anything. That's it. It's simple.
Ramsha, there is no need to think about anything. We are running away. That's it. OK?
Really?
So you are making this plan.
Brother Saqlain.
So this is happening instead of university.
Listen to me.
Shut up.
Don't say a single word.
Go with me, I don't want to create any drama in front of everyone here.
Let's go.
And listen.
Let me see you in my spare time.
Right?
Now see.
Come out.
Hey come out.
Ariba
Where are you?
Take care of your sister.
Lest you just watch and she would embarrass us and run away with Mahir.
With Mahir?
Faraz's brother Mahir.
Sometime he comes to give her purse and sometime drops her.
And Mahnoor
Cover up her brother in law by saying that she has sent him here.
There is no such thing sister.
Really?
Then what's the matter? Tell you sister.
Tell her what were you planning there?
They both were planning to run away and get married.
I have heard myself.
No, there is no such thing.
Mahir and I were just only....
Have some shame.
You crossed all limits in stubbornness.
I understood that night
There is some thing fishy going on.
And I realized that
You talk with him on phone.
You knew everything but didn't inform me.
Are all you sisters alike?
Saqlain.
Mahnoor didn't say anything to Ramsha neither did you say anything.
Mahnoor knows about it?
Yes she knows everything.
I have heard her conversation with Mahir myself.
And Mahir is doing all this due to Faraz's support.
Ask Mahnoor and Faraz to come here. I want to talk to them.
Hadn't Mahnoor humiliated us earlier and now Ramsha is doing the same.
Call her, why are you standing like this.
Get away.
Get out of my sight.
Get lost before I would do something.
Get out.
Hey call her.
If Faraz is not satisfied then we can wait
Wait a minute.
Hi
What's up sister Ariba?
Come home right now, immediately.
Right now?
Is everything alright?
No it's not.
Come here right now, right away. Immediately.
And bring Faraz with you.
Saqlain and I want to talk to him.
But sister, at least tell me what happened?
It was sister Ariba's call. She has asked me to come home.
And she said that they want to meet you as well.
Why?
It's fine to invite you but why have they invited Faraz?
This will be known by going there, Aunt.
It's OK if Faraz is not going with me. I will go myself.
No, Mahnoor I will go with you.
We will be back mom..
Let's go.
Why have they invited Faraz?
So you knew everything. Right?
You knew about that Ramsha is interested in Mahir.
Yes
I knew about it.
And Faraz?
You too?
Sister Ariba we...
Why are you asking one after another?
You didn't believe me when I informed you.
All of this happening with their support.
There is no such thing at all.
Ever since I came to know about it, I was advising Ramsha.
That she should treat Mahir only as a class fellow.
And Faraz
Faraz had forbidden Mahir.
And despite your forbidding, they are both spending time with each other.
Despite of going to university, they were moving around the city.
And your sister Ramsha.
Embarrassing us by spending time with that boy.
I
Let me talk to Ramsha and make her understand.
What will you advise her?
Hmm
Is there anything left to talk to her?
All of you have decided to humiliate me in front of my husband.
Earlier you did it and now Ramsha is doing the same thing.
You got married and left this house.
I and Saqlain live in this house.
We have Ramsha's responsibility.
If she run away from house and get married to your brother in law
Then I and Saqlain will not be able to face anyone.
What are you talking about, sister Ariba?
You know that Ramsha is not like that.
But your brother in law is.
And why are you staring at me like this Faraz?
Don't you know about your brother?
What's his nature?
You have no idea what they were discussing when I caught them.
Your brother was provoking Ramsha to run away and get married.
And if wouldn't have reached there then they would have done that.
You know your brother. Right?
I got tired by advising you but didn't listen to me.
I feared that this will happen.
But you
From now onward she won't go to university.
Sister
You have studied whatever you could.
Saqlain and I will search a groom and marry her.
You are absolutely right.
Do whatever you find suitable.
I feel too that there is no need for Ramsha to go to university.
Listen to me
You can't do this to me.
Sister
Please listen to me sister.
Sister
Mom I need some amount.
As I told you that I don't have anything.
Mom I asked you for a little amount. What happened to you?
Mahir
Yes brother
