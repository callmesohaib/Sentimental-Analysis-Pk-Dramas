Mother! No! No!
No! You cannot leave us like this! Mother please! Talk to me.
Tell them to get away from mother. Sister please get away.
Mother! Listen mother! Wake up mother. Open your eyes mother. Mother please!
Please call the doctor! This cannot happen! This cannot happen. Sister!
You guys won't listen to me. I'll call the doctor myself.
Rimsha!
Mother! Mother!
What happened? Why do you look so stunned? Is everything alright?
Mother! Mahnoor's mother just died.
What?
Faraz told me that we should go to there house with Maheer.
Fine!
They'll be in the hospital right now. We'll surely leave after they reach home.
If she had only seen her youngest daughter get married too.
The eldest two are stable and have their own families. Who'll look after Rimsha?
There's no father or mother to look after them. They don't even have a brother who could've looked after them.
What can we say! It's gods plan that her youngest daughter isn't married.
How will she manage without her mother?
Whatever god decides.
You cannot leave us like this. Sister! Tell mother that she cannot leave us. We cannot live without her.
Mother! Please don't leave us like this mother. Please mother!
Ask her! How can she leave us alone like this?
Sister! Control!
Please sister! Ask mother to wake up one last time. Please sister ask her. Ask mother to open her eyes! Please sister.
Please sister! Ask mother to wake up one last time. I won't ever disturb her after that! She'll listen to you sister.
Sister!
It's time for the funeral!
Saqlain!
No darling! Stay calm.
You guys won't take her! No not at all. Please don't take her.
Faraz! Don't take my mother away from me. Faraz please!
Mahnoor! Your tears will hurt your mother.
Doctor said that mother is totally healthy and her operation was successful too. How can she leave us like that?
She still had to live for us.
It all happens according to god's plan.
But mother...
Fine! You can cry as much as you want.
It'll help you release the pressure on your heart.
But I know that crying won't bring her back.
You are so strong! You've faced many problems so confidently.
If you lose your determination and continue with crying. Who'll take care of Rimsha? Who'll worry about her?
She is really close to you. She is younger than you.
She needs you.
Rimsha!
Stop crying! Control your emotions.
Mother just left me alone.
There's no one to look after me.
No! You're not alone.
Rimsha! Your sisters are here for you. I'm here for you too.
We all are here for you. You are not alone.
Crying won't help you heal the wounds.
Ask her to stop crying.
Fine! Now stop crying.
You guys haven't ate! Please eat something.
I'm not hungry!
You still have to eat.
You guys didn't eat anything from yesterday.
I'll ask Salma to bring some food for you guys.
Areeba! Where is Saqlain?
I don't know! He might be outside.
He is also really stressed like us.
Enough!
Eat more!
I've eaten too much.
No! You haven't.
It's enough for me.
I'll go now.
Thank god that she left.
You are right! Thank god that she left us.
She somehow knew about my second marriage and the kid.
There could've been a drama.
Those three sisters are still a headache for you.
Don't you worry. I'll handle them.
I'll go now.
Where are you going?
Keep sitting! Don't move to much in such condition. Take care of yourself.
I'm going home! Where else would I go?
I came here from there to relax my mind a little bit. I'll have to hear the cries again.
Sure! Will you visit me tomorrow?
I'll visit you every time you call me.
Even if you don't call me. I'll still come.
I feel attached to you so much that you cannot imagine.
Take care!
Sure!
Mahnoor!
Rimsha! Why are you not eating? Here! Eat it.
Areeba! You should eat too.
Mahnoor! You need to eat. Please eat! Everyone should.
You should eat too! You didn't eat.
I'm fine.
Eat with us.
OK! I'll start. You guys should too.
Eat it!
Saqlain!
Are you back? Where were you?
Where would I be?
I went to visit the graveyard.
I cannot stay in this house after she left.
Whatever! You guys should continue eating.
I'm unable to digest a single bite. Faraz forcefully made us eat.
You didn't eat anything too. Sit here!
No! I won't be able to digest it.
You should eat! I'm right here.
Saqlain! Please sit. Eat something.
No! I won't be able to eat.
It's a great loss.
You are new to this family! Your attachment isn't like mine.
I'm was attached to aunt.
She treated me like her son.
Now that she isn't around anymore. I feel like somebody took my mother away from me again.
Saqlain!
You!
I'm fine! Totally fine.
Sit!
Sit here.
We are fine! You guys can eat.
Fine.
What are you doing mother?
Tell me! Why did you ask Mahnoor for the books?
Faraz could've brought you all these if you are really that interested in studies.
When did you start studying such big books. You used to study so moderately.
All that stuff is really boring mother! This book is really interesting. Even Mahnoor told me that I can ask her for any book.
Whatever Mahnoor said! You should also learn how to place them.
You are about to get married! You'll get me disrespected. Your parents in law will complain that I didn't teach you manners.
Place it properly.
Why are you always angry?
I'll hit you.
I'll teach you a lesson. Windup everything.
Are you back son?
Yes! Greetings.
Greetings! I was thinking that you'll stay there son.
Mahnoor didn't come?
Mahnoor will be back soon.
Why are you going in the kitchen?
I was having a headache so I need some tea.
Son! Tell me. I'm standing right in front of you.
I didn't want to disturb you mother.
Son! I'm your mother! I'm not your wife that you should feel ashamed for asking a favor.
I've spent my whole life for your betterment. I've never thought about my own self.
I'll make tea for you. Will you eat something?
No! I did lunch.
Don't lie!
No mother! Mahnoor made me eat it. I just wanted some tea so I can take medicine before attending the office too.
Now you'll attend the office too?
Yes! It's important.
Son! Take care of yourself. You are already too fatigued. Now you'll attend the office too?
Mother! I'll be back soon.
See! Mahnoor cannot attend the office so it's must for me to be there in her absence.
Don't worry! I'll be back soon. I'll rest!
Sit! I'll go make you some tea.
I'm always praying for you all! What else can I do?
Take care of Rimsha! I hope that I'll soon arrange her marriage.
It's just a matter of one year! She wants to study so let her study. She'll get married soon.
I don't know that I have that much of a time.
Greetings sir!
It was a serious and sudden heart attack! Thank you.
I'll join soon! Thank you.
What about the medicine report?
You have to take care of yourself.
How will she stay here all alone? I cannot stay here.
You've to go back to your home too.
I'll ask Saqlain that what should we do?
She can come with me. I'll take her.
You live in a proper family and it's not good for her to stay there.
She can stay with us at our home.
You know that Saqlain won't let her live here all alone.
You can go handle the kitchen.
Sure!
Areeba! I've managed everything. Shared the food in the neighborhood too.
The soul will get blessings. I've told Salma that she'll stay here 24/7.
She'll be here for Rimsha!
I was thinking..
Areeba! We cannot leave Rimsha alone in this house.
She is a kid! She'll get scared. I've told Salma to look after Rimsha.
She look after Rimsha and the whole house properly.
Do as you like but I was thinking that..
Don't talk about her marriage right now.
Aunt just recently died. This is not the time to discuss such things.
She is a kid right now! Let her study. Aunt wanted this too.
That she should finish her studies! We've spent millions on her studies.
Let her complete the degree first.
I'll go attend the call.
Can I get a cup of tea?
I'm studying right now.
It's the fourth day! Mahnoor didn't think about returning back to her home.
It's just been 4 days since aunt died. She'll be back.
Darling! She has died and her soul has departed. I feel bad too. What else can we do?
Mahnoor isn't responsible at all! She doesn't care about her home and her husband. Faraz has always supported her.
He was just telling me that she has lost her mother so don't let Mahnoor feel like she doesn't have her mother around.
Mahnoor should also care about Faraz!
My hardworking son! He always comes home tired and doesn't have a wife around to ask him about a glass of water.
What special thing did she do before? She is the boss of brother.
She gives orders to him in the office then how can she be that humble at home.
So you are the one who takes care of Faraz? You have never washed your own socks. Me and mother do it for you.
Sister in law is really responsible! She gives equal time in the office and at home.
Why are you taking her side?
Now she doesn't care about this house or her office.
Why would she? My brother is there. I feel like that she forcefully stopped the promotion of brother.
So that he can work for her in the office and stay down to earth. Simple!
Aunt! Do you need anything?
No!
Mahnoor! We have to go through a lot when we are alive.
We have to suffer a lot of pain! This is life! I know that nobody can replace your parents.
If I state myself as your mother. It won't actually change our relation and you won't literally think of me as your mother but still I'm telling you.
I want that my sons stays happy and confident in his family so you should take some responsibilities too.
I ..
Enough! Try to understand me. He is your husband, not your servant. He has a lot of burden. Don't just sit at home.
What did he get? You stopped his promotion too.
I didn't do anything like this! I don't have the authority. You are being misguided by Maheer.
Fine! Whatever happened, let it go.
I didn't want you to work from the day you got married. Faraz just didn't let me speak.
Now he is facing the problems himself.
I'll go now.
