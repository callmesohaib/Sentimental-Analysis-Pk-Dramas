Sister in law! Tell me about your mother's health.
She is better.
I wanted to go and ask about your mother's health with my mother but..
Your mother will soon be safe and healthy. Don't you worry.
Surely! Do pray for her.
Sure!
Listen! Go ask your mother that what should I cook for today. I'll start preparing it.
You came back after so long. You look so tired!
Me and mother will manage the food ourselves. Don't you worry about it. Take care of yourself.
No! I'm totally fine. I'm not tired.
You and aunt are always working. I should fulfill my duty in this house too.
Go and ask aunt about the food! I'll start preparing it then.
Fine! I'll help you too.
No! There's no need.
Maheer! Come. Where are you?
Sure! I'm here.
Eat!
Whoever finds us alone like this! I don't know what would they think of us.
So? What's the problem?
That your sister...
What happened?
Why did you stop?
It's nothing! I'm taking it.
I thought that you might leave to meet your friends. It's great that you joined us to eat.
Water.
Mother! I'll be back in a bit.
Food?
I'll be back.
What's so important to him?
How is aunt?
She is feeling better.
Is she awake?
She is sleeping!
Are you home?
Why?
I'm just asking.
It's been days since you are looking after my mother in the hospital. You would be tired.
That's why I wanted to leave with you.
I won't call and disturb you.
Take care!
Goodbye!
This lady gives me a headache by her inquiries.
I'm sorry! I know that you are feeling bad but my aunt is sick so it's my duty to ask about her. Please understand.
Fine! Now I'll switch off my phone so nobody disturbs us. Happy?
It would be so great if this old lady dies.
She'll die soon. She has passed her age.
Its good that aunt is sick and Areeba is looking after her. Now I can spend time with you.
Wow! I'm so lucky. I'm so dependent on Areeba.
I mean that you are spending time with me because of Areeba.
Come on. Don't spoil your mood. We are here for a dinner. Please enjoy!
Should I talk to Faraz and tell him about Maheer? No.
I should not discuss it with him. Both the brothers might fight each other. I'll be blamed later.
My goal is to tell Rimsha about the activities of Maheer. If she understands me, then I don't have to worry about them anymore.
How are feeling aunt?
I'm better than before, son.
I cannot eat the food that has been recommended.
Don't worry about it! I've asked the doctor about it. It's just for some weeks. You'll shift back to your normal diet after some days.
Mother! Doctor has said it. You'll soon be able to eat your normal diet too.
Aunt! I needed your signatures on these papers.
What are they about?
It's for the house! It's sold.
You got some papers signed by mother few days ago.
Those papers were to clarify that I can sell and buy a house on the behalf of aunt.
But the property belongs to aunt and she needs to sign these to transfer it.
You can read them yourself.
But the property belongs to aunt and she needs to sign these to transfer it.
You can read them yourself.
Sure!
No need to.
You are doing everything for this house and everybody knows it.
No! Let Mahnoor see it. She might not believe me.
Here! These are the details. This amount will be shifted in aunt's account tomorrow.
I'm free of this headache.
The deal of that house happened so quick because of you.
All the matters of this house are going great because of you.
If I don't do it then who else will?
Hello! Yes Rimsha?
What do you mean?
Wait a minute. Saqlain! Can you pick Rimsha?
Her driver didn't pick her.
I would've picked her myself but I'm getting late from my office.
What's there to worry about? Your brother in law, Maheer? Didn't he attend the university today?
Tell him to drop Rimsha. He has helped her before.
Rimsha! I'll pick you. We don't need to ask a stranger for help when we can help ourselves.
OK!
Mother! I'll go pick Rimsha.
Leave it! I'll pick her myself. You are getting late.
Aunt! Sign these papers, so that I can go and pick Rimsha.
Here! 
Fine! I'll go now. Goodbye!
I've told you so many times to read the papers yourself.
Why darling? Saqlain has read the papers himself already.
Saqlain?
What about your studies?
I'm doing fine.
Why are you talking so lazily? I hope you won't fail.
No! I'll surely pass my exams. My routine is bad from some days. I can't attend my university.
My exams are near too. I cannot handle the stress.
You would've missed your notes! Why don't you get some help from your class fellows?
What's his name? Maheer? He is in your university too?
Why don't you ask him for help?
We have a relation with him because of Mahnoor.
Tell me about his progress.
He is good in studies.
In fact! He is the most brilliant student in our class.
He helps me out! He helps everyone in the class.
This means that he is a nice guy. People who help others are really rare.
Its hard to find such people today! Are you friends with him?
No! Why would I be friends with him? I don't have any male friends.
Fine!
Manage your notes on time. Don't get failed! Take it easy and don't stress.
Yes! I've conversed. We have made an order list after confirming it from them.
Mahnoor ma'am is not in her office right now.
I'll get her signs after she comes! I cannot send you the list before getting her approval.
She isn't physically present here! You should get the check ready so that we can send the order.
Sir! Why are you stressing yourself? These finance companies never listen to us.
You are right my friend.
These finance companies don't like to give away the money.
They think that the money belongs to them.
He was right too.
Without the signs of Mahnoor ma'am, the manager won't sign the check.
I'll get her signs after she reaches. I just want to send the materials order today.
Sir! You are so hardworking. You work for yourself too. You even handle the work of Mahnoor ma'am.
Sir! Will ma'am credit you for this and put you in the list of appraisals for this year? She should talk about your promotion.
You are working hard these days.
Promotion gets sir the seat of Mahnoor ma'am.
Why would she hand over her seat to him? It's not fare to her.
She wouldn't give her power or position to somebody else.
I'm not talking about somebody else.
Faraz sir is her husband. She can give her position to him at any point.
Faraz sir also works in her office too.
Can't you guys mind your own business? Is it important to talk about something foolish?
Pay attention on your official work here.
Looks like our discussion hurt him directly on his heart.
Act mature.
Yes! Mother is fine. I just reached the office.
No problem! Send the file. I'll sign it.
Thank you!
Come in.
Here!
I've made a big mistake.
I should have handed over my authority to someone else before applying for a leave.
I'll ask Ruqqiya to type a notification for the office that my authority will be handled by you in my absence.
You can directly get an approval from the general manager.
Sure! That'll be great.
Faraz!
I've got this appraisal sheet.
I've to describe the performance of our department from last year.
I was thinking that I should not fill this form from your side.
Why?
I mean that you are the head of department. Who else would fill this form?
Yes! But before it was something else. You are my husband now.
I don't want my opinion to be judged later.
You are handling my work from some weeks too.
If it was not you! I wouldn't have been able to get a leave from the office and have a peaceful mind. You took care of everything behind me.
The amount of work you've done! I don't think that there's enough space to write about it on this form.
Then please write the main details about me.
I'm supporting you Mahnoor.
Not because I'm greedy for the promotion.
You can write the truth about me! So nobody questions you later.
I work in this company!
I just take the salary! It's my right!
The things that I'm trying to facilitate my wife with. I don't want the results from this company.
Whatever! Today I have to join mother on an invitation. I'll leave early.
Should I join too?
Sure! Why not. You should come with us too. You should meet them. Mother was impressed by them. Let's judge them today.
Sure!
My daughter looks so beautiful today. You look fresh from the day Ramiz came in your life.
Remember! Don't get weak in your relation. You might turn out like Ramiz or Saqlain. It's up to you.
You can be weak! But you cannot be stupid.
They both are stupid.
Ramiz is outside! I'll go now.
What if Saqlain comes? What should I tell him about you?
Mother! What's wrong? You can tell him that I went for shopping. Don't take tension. He told me that he is busy today.
That's why I planned something with Ramiz.
Fine! Then go. But remember one thing that you should earn something from him before Saqlain finds out about this relation.
I will.
Go! He'll be waiting.
Hey! Please take something to eat.
Sure! I'll take it.
Your house is really beautiful.
Thank you! Whatever we have, It all belongs to our Yasir.
Just know that our main asset is Yasir.
Father of Yasir?
He is in Doha!
He wanted Yasir to fly to him after completing his degree.
What would I do after moving to Doha? I have the best job right here in Pakistan. In fact I want my father to come back too. No need to stay there.
Yes! Overseas is overseas. It doesn't matter that you earn in millions.
Why don't you guys move to Doha?
I mean that Yasir's father is also there and you guys can get settled there properly. Why don't you guys?
Because of my studies.
We lived there before! Yasir had to continue his studies so we got a house here and got settled here.
Now we are trying to call his father back too.
You didn't tell us about the approval.
Yes! We actually..
I told you already that I approve.
We have seen everything and talked about everything. I'm happy with this relation. You can decide the date of engagement.
I'm so happy after listening this! It's time for us to congratulate each other on this relation. Eat some sweets.
Sure!
How did you feel? I mean did you like meeting Yasir and his family?
Do you think that Yasir is a match for my sister?
Why are you asking me?
Don't you approve it?
No! I'm just asking you for an opinion.
Listen! Aunt has already decided. She has approved it.
What's the need for my opinion.
I didn't expect mother to decide so quickly.
I thought that we are just going to meet them! But mother decided to approve it.
You are thinking a lot! Yasir looked like a decent guy and he was well educated. He is good looking.
The match is perfect.
I don't know but I think they were faking themselves.
It seems like they just got money in their hands.
Their behavior looked so artificial.
It seemed like they were trying to impress us.
You are right! I did notice it. They were trying to impress us. Maybe because it was our first meeting so that's why they were trying hard.
Maybe next time when they come, everything will be normal.
I wish it happens.
So I'm gonna go and visit my mother! It's my lunch break.
You should come as well! She was asking about you.
Sure! I'm free as well. We ca go. We'll take something for home too.
Mother is eating the prescribed food.
We'll take something for Rimsha and take some healthy fruits for mother.
Sure! Let's go.
Aunt! Rimsha isn't back yet?
She'll be back soon. I talked to her on phone. She told me that she is on the way.
There she is.
Greetings mother!  Greetings Saqlain!
Greetings!
Your university ends at 1:30.
Where were you?
Wow! Mahnoor is here too.
How are you Mahnoor? Your little sister just reached home.
Would you like to ask her about her whereabouts?
Saqlain! I got late due to my extra class.
Really? Which extra class?
It was Rimsha's accounting class! I know about it.
Why didn't anybody tell me about it?
Actually! She missed a lot of her classes. She is attending the extra class to cover her syllabus.
Faraz! Come and sit please.
Greetings!  Greetings!
Sit down.
Thank you.
You visited after so long.
Yes! Actually I was busy with my official work. That's why.
I'm stunned Mahnoor! You pressurize your own husband after being a boss in the company.
She gets her work done by you. Doesn't she enjoy her job?
No! It's nothing like that Saqlain. I'm just stressed because of an ongoing project in the company. I'm working hard on it.
Faraz! I've noted that you are a hard working man. Nobody really cares for a hard working man. The boss of the company takes the credit after all.
In your case, you'll get the credit for your hard work back to you because your boss is your own wife Mahnoor.
How do you feel calling your own wife a ma'am in your office?
It's funny for me.
Yes! Sometimes I laugh too.
Rimsha! We brought food for you.
Rimsha had her lunch.
She doesn't leave her stomach empty for that long. She would've eaten something. Right?
I think she is upset now! You scolded her a little too much.
Mahnoor! Go look after her.
I'll go see her!
Where were you? Why did you come back so late?
You went with Maheer again?
No! I was in the university. A class fellow organized a party. That's why I got late.
Why did you lie to Saqlain?
He would've badly scolded me if I had told him about a party instead of my class. 
Rimsha! I'm getting scared by your actions. I don't know what are you up to.
I think that I should let you go! The way that Saqlain and Areeba want to handle you, I should let them because you won't listen to me.
Sister! I'm telling the truth that I was in university and I was not with Maheer.
I can understand your truth and lies.
You should get back on track. I'm warning you.
Aunt! I'll go now. Mahnoor and Faraz are here for you.
You just came! Sit for a bit.
Saqlain! Please sit with us. Lets have a chat.
I don't have that much free time to have a chat.
I just came here to pick up the bill. I'll get it paid.
Aunt! The bill is more than average.
Electricity is expensive now.
Why don't you pay the bill online? Bills can be payed online nowadays.
Oh! I didn't know that we can pay the bill online.
It's good that you told me. You are a smart man.
If you don't know, then give it to me. I'll get it paid.
No need to! You've told me. I'll look for it myself.
Aunt! I'll leave.
See this.
What's with you? Why are you so lazy? See this.
I'm thinking of giving this to your mother in law. I'm also thinking to give some piece of gold on your engagement.
Mother! What's wrong with you? You said it yourself that I can take admission. Why are you getting me engaged so early.
I just said it, but I won't let such a great proposal slide because of your studies.
What is so special in them?
You haven't seen there house yet! That's why you are getting irritated. You'll realize when you visit them.
When you see that house, your eyes won't blink! You'll thank me for not letting you study and getting you married so quickly.
Suggest me something at least.
You won't listen to me.
Maheer!
Yes?
I want to talk to you.
Speak!
Don't mind! I don't have an issue with you or your lifestyle.
I don't hate you! You are a good guy but I have a request.
Please stay away from Rimsha! She is not your type.
You are thinking wrong.
I don't have an objection but Rimsha cannot afford your friendship.
She attends the university to complete her studies. We all want her to focus on her studies.
She might leave her studies after getting involved in other activities.
I'm just requesting you.
You should avoid Rimsha! I didn't talk to Faraz about it, because I don't want a fuss.
I hope you understand.
