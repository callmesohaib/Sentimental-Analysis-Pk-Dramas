Why was the door locked?
Actually I was changing.
Are you ready?
You go ahead, I'm coming in two minutes.
Why is Ramsha not talking to me?
If she cannot talk to me. She can at least reply to my message.
Yes tell me?
Here.. These are your divorce papers.
So fast?
Shouldn't I have made them. You only told me to.
You are always in a hurry for everything. But oh well, its okay if they're ready.
Sir can I ask you something? Do you really want to divorce Areeba?
What will I do staying in a relationship with her?
If brother Toqeer can take a step, I'll be satisfied. I'll revel in luxuries then.
By the way, getting married for the second time isn't wrong. 
Do you see how Mr. Touqueer married your sister in law for the second time?
I know there's nothing wrong. I made these papers to satisfy Fariya because she wouldn't agree. 
That's why I asked you to make the divorce papers on the phone.
Otherwise I am in no mood to divorce Areeba just now.
I remember, brother Touqeer has asked us something.
 He wants to get a shipment cleared. Don't worry about the payment.
 Touqeer will pay good.
Here is the assignment that needs to be cleared.
I'll see.
No don't see. Get it done as fast as possible.
It will be done but it will cost you.
You're a greedy man. 
When did I not pay you?
I will take the money from brother Touqeer and give it to you. Don't worry.
Sir, I've learnt from the best there are.
You will not leave without tea. 
Send two cups of teas in.
Sir tell me, if you divorce Areeba, what benefit will you get from it?
There are a lot of benefits, for you and me.
We should just keep our work running.
Of course it will.
Thank you.
Sir he is my brother in law Maheer. He's a very bright student. A topper.
 Please if possible,
please get it done before his exams. If he cannot appear for exams his semester will suffer. 
yes thank you! Oh Faraz.. Come. sit
This production report.
I'll see to it but listen to me first.
Please look at it first. We cannot delay sending the material.
Leave everything. Brother Yasir's interview is done. 
The HR called. His interview went good. Hopefully he'll get the job.
And I'll find out if I meet Sir Aleem.
Please tell mom.
I will tell aunty. 
Listen, I talked to a professor I knew for Maheer.
He has assured me that he will take Maheer back in certainly.
Mahnoor can you recall when was the last time we talked to each other about ourselves?
When did we sit together and discussed our problems. 
I think not even once in a few months.
Faraz?
We only discuss other people's problems and find solutions for them.
Its not like that. It isn't. Don't say that.
What do we talk about? 
We never talk about ourselves.
I think we are together because we have to find the solution to the problem of the world.
Our problems aren't important.
Okay. 
Leave everything aside and tell me whats the problem. 
We'll discuss that first. What happened?
Don't you know what problems we have?
Are you saying this because of Wasay?
It must be Wasay's call 
and you will definitely not like to talk in front of me.
I'll wait outside but please see the file. Its important.
Faraz.. Listen to me..
What is your problem? Why don't you understand? 
You created a scene yesterday and now you're calling me.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have come to your office yesterday 
but I was concerned.
You don't have to worry about me. You don't.
Its because of you that my relationship with Faraz is being spoiled.
 You call me again and again. If you want to do something for me. Stop contacting me.
Is your relationship so weak with him 
that it got affected when I met you. 
This means that this relationship is just for the sake of it.
Otherwise the person you are rejecting me and my love for. 
The person you're fighting with me for, he should be proud of his fate.
You chose him. You're complaining I couldn't get you respect in my family. 
I was ready to leave them for you.
My parents, my wealth. I wanted to kick away everything for you. 
Even today I'm waiting for a signal from you.
If you want, you can try me.
Where did I keep it? Everything is empty here.
 It seems Areeba has taken everything. 
What is wrong with my memory? I'm so stupid.
I forgot where I kept it or did I keep it somewhere else. 
Did Areeba find it? 
Maybe that's why yesterday she was... No..
What is wrong Mr. Faraz? Are you feeling alright?
Yes I'm fine.
Maybe you've been scolded by miss Mahnoor. That's why you're so worried. 
We have to agree. Ever since Mahnoor is back from her leaves, she has become aggressive.
She keeps on scolding everyone even on the tiniest things. 
But what can we do? She's our boss.
Areeba, I was dusting and found Saqlain sir's file. Where should I keep it?
Keep it in my room.
Listen, don't touch it.
Are you alright, mam Areeba?
I don't know I have a headache and I'm feeling anxious.
May God keep everything alright. If you say, should I call Mahnoor?
Why? Why will you call Mahnoor? Is she a doctor? Go and do your work.
I am tensed because of Mahnoor and Ramsha. 
Both of them get me insulted by my husband every other day.
Go and keep the file in the room.
Alright.
Areeba I'm busy in the office and I might have to go to Hyderabad. 
If I don't come home, don't wait up.
Did you tell her?
Yes. I told her that I won't come home.
But you didn't tell her that you're staying with me.
Its not needed.
 I'm here to make you happy. Tell me whats the plan? 
You want to go have dinner?
Of course we will have dinner but I want to shop as well.
Go ahead and shop. When did I say no to you?
But you will not say that you have no money.
I will always have money for you. 
Now you don't have to get ready, I like you as you are.
Alright. Fine.
Come.
Areeba I'm busy in the office and I might have to go to Hyderabad.
 If I don't come home, don't wait up.
Listen, I'm not feeling well. 
Please don't go today.
Thank God a million. I am hearing two good news in one day.
 Yasir's job and a hope for Maheer's readmission in his university.
You should ask Maheer to prepare for his exams. 
He will have to join the university in a few days. His interview was very good.
As God wills. Did you hear?
Mahnoor has stopped your year from being wasted. Thank her.
There's no need. I just want,
Maheer to focus on his studies.
He will focus. He will definitely study. 
He has no responsibilities. He will complete his studies and support his brother.
My dear. Maheer. Whatever is done is done. And dear,
focus on yourself. Groom yourself. See what you have done to yourself.
What have I done? I'm fine.
How are you fine? You used to take care of yourself. Do now as well.
Earlier it was different and now its different.
Do you want me to be like I was before? That me caused so much pain.
You had to bear so much disrespect because of me and Ramsha..
Her whole life has been destroyed.
My dear. This is how God must have decided for you. 
But dear, move on. This is life.
Get a grip on yourself.
Alright.
Thank God. We finally have good news in this house too.
Did you like anything?
I already have so much jewelry at home. 
Why do we need all this?
We need it because girls should have more jewelry but not less.
I like this and this and this. You tell me what you like so we'll buy something.
But you should choose something.
We're not here for me. We're here for you. Chose something so that we can buy...
My choice and happiness has no importance. 
When I cannot spend my life as I wish, why should I buy all this jewelry? 
What will I do with it?
Faraz.. Faraz what is wrong with you? Why are you not talking to me?
What should I say to you?
You're asking me what you should say to me? 
You haven't talked to me for the past two days.
 Are you upset with me?
Just because Wasay came to meet me.
No. 
There is nothing to be upset about it.
Then? Whats the problem then?
There is no problem.
You don't trust me.
Do you think Wasay came to meet me and he and I.. 
Wasay and I have nothing between us.
But then how did he come to the office to meet you?
I don't know. I don't even know who gave him the address.
 I just saw him after I gave my exam.
And I just..
You have your exam tomorrow? What time?
In the morning.
So should I drop you?
No. You should go to the office and work. There is so much work.
I will go myself. My car is at home only.
That's why you stopped me from dropping you. 
You say you don't trust me but you're the one with trust issues.
No..
You met Wasay and talked to him. This means you might have connected with him on the phone.
You didn't share with me.
Faraz because..
Because you don't trust me.
No. Its not that. I didn't tell you because of another reason.
Mahnoor I have always loved and honored everyone in my life. I sacrificed myself.
I neglected myself. 
But trust me I have never gotten back anything in return. Nothing.
I have never gotten anything. Ever.
Is your shopping complete now?
Almost.
Thank God.
I made you spend so much today. 
But as it is you brought me shopping after a long time today. Specially for jewelry.
Thank you.
Just remind me. I keep forgetting because I'm busy. 
I haven't been able to recall a few things.
What can't you recall?
I kept something somewhere and I can't remember where.
I'm hungry. Lets eat something. Excuse me, can we have the menu please.
What happened Ramsha? Did you see someone?
I saw brother Saqlain with some girl.
Do you want to meet him? Its not a good place. 
Malls aren't a place for family reunions. 
What are you thinking? lets go
Who was that girl with brother Saqlain? and they were holding hands & were so close to each other
I should tell Areeba about it. 
And it would have been good if I had confronted brother Saqlain. Everybody would know about his real face.
He insulted me and sister Mahnoor when he is doing this himself.
What was the use?
 Bringing you here and shopping? What benefit did all my efforts get?
You are still upset. 
You're still in the same mood that you left the house in. 
actually... 
To be honest it seems I'm wasting my time with you.
Whatever I do, nothing makes you happy. 
What should we do that will put you in a better mood?
You are always upset. 
And frankly, I think I should stop making any efforts with you.
Bring the bill please.
Sorry.
I'm hungry. We should eat. Excuse me, can we have the menu please.
What should we do that will put you in a better mood? 
You're always in a bad mood. And frankly,
it seems I should stop making any efforts with you.
Sister in law..
What happened?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Its okay.
Are you still upset with me?
 I know its not easy to forgive whatever I did..
But I never thought whatever I was doing would result in such bad consequences.
You should have thought. 
But now take this as a lesson for the future.
Don't ever do such a thing with anyone again. Don't joke with anybody's life. 
Nothing happened with you. I saved you.
But poor Ramsha..
Ramsha. How is she?
You shouldn't have worried about her. She's fine wherever she is
You have already created problems for her.
I don't want her to get hurt anymore because of you. 
Please Maheer, stay away from her.
Yes.
Had it been so easy to listen to you, I wouldn't have been crying. 
I'm amazed why am I obsessed with Ramsha?
Why can't I forget her? Why am I pining to hear her? But she isn't talking to me at all.
Are you alright?
Yes.
what will happen to me?
Why do you look so upset? It seems you have been crying.
Crying has been written in my fate.
Why are you saying this? Did you argue with brother Saqlain? Is there a problem?
No.
Does Areeba know about brother Saqlain and..
What about brother Saqlain?
I saw him with a girl in the mall. She looked as if she was pretty young. Around 22-23.
