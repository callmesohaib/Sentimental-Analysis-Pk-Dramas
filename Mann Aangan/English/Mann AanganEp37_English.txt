He's your husband, don't make him your employee. You took time off from work and asked him to do your share of the work.
What did that poor man get in return? You didn't even let him get promoted.
Yes?
Faraz, you're still not home yet.
Yes... I was just checking the production cycle.
Please come home, I'll come to work tomorrow and check in on everything.
What is the matter?
Is everything alright?
Yes, it is.
When I came home, you weren't present there.
And... I was missing you.
You were missing me?
Why? Can't I miss you?
Do you not miss me in my absence?
No... I miss you a lot. I can't seem to concentrate on work without you here.
I've gotten used to you.
Alright then, come back home immediately. You can take care of the work later. I'm waiting for you.
Okay... I'm coming.
Farewell.
It's Saqlain.
Hello... greetings.
Areeba, come home quickly.
Is everything alright...
Nothing is alright, that's why I'm calling you here.
I don't feel well at all.
What happened? Are you alright?
I'm not fine.
I feel immense pain in my chest. Come home quickly.
Saqlain, go to a doctor immediately.
How can I go to a doctor?
Come home!
I'll leave right now. I'll be right there.
Saqlain is not feeling well. I have to go. Don't worry...
I'll go and get Salma.
What happened? Why are you leaving me alone?
Don't worry. Sister Salma is here with you. Call me if you need anything
I'm alone here.
Enough sister, why are you crying?
What else should I do?
No one cares for me.
Mother has left me and the rest of them have left me as well.
No sister, everyone cares for you.
And I'm here with you. Sister Mahnoor was so worried about you that she asked me not to leave you, even for a single minute.
That's why she left, right?
Try and understand her compulsion.
She can't stay here forever. Look I've ironed your clothes for tomorrow. You'll go to university tomorrow, right?
Hmm.
How are you feeling now?
It's better than before.
I would feel better if you visit a doctor.
There is no need for that. I'll feel better once I eat.
Why aren't you eating?
I don't feel like eating anything. When you called and told me that you weren't feeling well...
I felt strange. Thank God you're alright now.
I was thinking of bringing Ramsha here for a few days.
What need is there to bring her here?
I called her... she was scared and crying.
She's alone at home so...
Salma is there with her. We hired her twenty-four-seven so that Ramsha isn't alone.
Look Areeba, it's not that I don't want to bring Ramsha here.
I'm worried for her as well. But this isn't the solution. Even if she stays here for a few days, in the end, she'll have to go back.
You're right.
She has to get used to living alone.
Alright, don't worry. We'll think about this.
We'll find a solution.
Shall I serve dinner?
Yes.
What is the matter? Are you feeling a lot of pain?
No, it's alright. I've taken a few painkillers, I'll be fine.
Eat.
What is it? What are you doing?
You said that you missed me.
But ever since I came home, you haven't even looked at me.
You're keeping yourself busy.
The closet is very disorganized.
I decided that I was set your clothing.
Yes, it's my fault. I've messed up the closet.
How?
Why do you take the blame for every mistake I make?
It's my fault. When you're at home, everything is in its place.
I am the one who messes them up.
Shall I ask you something?
Sure...
What complaints do you have against me?
Complaints? What complaints?
Complaints about a home.... complaint about the office...
Complaints about our personal life.
You've always stood by me.
I think...
that I'm not reciprocating that.
That is a weird thing to say.
Now that you've asked me, let me tell you. I have no complaints against you.
I think that because of me I've started becoming more confident in myself.
I feel that I can say anything to you. That's why if I ever have a complaint, I won't keep it in my heart, I'll tell you.
I think that we at least have that much understanding.
How's Ramsha?
She's fine. She's just a little worried.
Because of her, I'm worried. How will she live alone?
Let's bring her here.
I'll drop you there, you can meet her.
Shall we go outside for a while? The weather is pleasant today.
That will improve both our moods.
Sister Ramsha?
Yes?
Get up and have something to eat.
I don't want to. You can go ahead.
Sister, you didn't have lunch as well.
Sister Mahnoor asked me to feed you.
Otherwise, you'll get sick.
I won't die if I don't eat a single day.
And even if I die, it's not like anyone would care.
Go away, I don't want to eat.
Hello... greetings. Is everything alright?
Greetings to you too. As per your habit, you were not picking up.
No Asif it's not like that. My phone was in the kitchen that's why...
Why don't you keep your phone with you?
Who keeps their phone on their person at all times?
You know that I can call you at any hour.
Yasir... is it not possible that you to call me at a set time. I mean...
I understand what you mean...
Maybe you don't like talking to me.
It's not like that. Don't mind, I was saying it for your convenience.
Look... I can call you anytime I feel like it.
Tell me, is sister Mahnoor home? Mother and I wanted to pay our condolences on her mother's demise.
We decided that we would come by if she was home.
Alright, I'll make mother aware of this.
I mean... anything!
Faraz, I didn't know that you knew so many jokes.
I memorized them...
It was never hard before to make you laugh.
Mahnoor, please don't start crying now.
You don't know how precious your tears are to me.
When you cry... I don't like it at all.
Sister Salma!
Sister Salma!
I'll call sister Mahnoor.
Pick up the phone 
Sister Areeba.
Sister Areeba, there's someone in the house.
What happened Ramsha? Who is it?
I don't know, first, he climbed into the house, and now he's at my door.
I feel afraid. Please come here.
What I want you to do...
is lock your room from the inside.
I...
I've locked it.
Ramsha, I'll call Saqlain right now.
He's not at home... I'll leave as soon as he comes.
What is it, is everything alright?
It's Ramsha, she says that there's someone inside the house.
Ramsha, what happened?
Brother Saqlain, I feel afraid...
If he comes inside, what will I do? Sister Salma isn't home, I feel afraid, please come home.
No one will come inside. Don't open the door. We'll be right there.
Don't worry, we're here now. Saqlain will fix everything.
He's here.
I saw everything downstairs. Everything seems fine here as well.
I saw everything. Everything is in its place. Nothing has been stolen.
How can anything be stolen, when there was no one inside?
No!
Sister, someone was here. I'm telling the truth.
Sister Ramsha, I closed all the windows and doors in the evening. How can someone come inside?
Yes, there was someone outside. He was knocking on the door, it felt that he would break the door down.
No... sister, someone was trying to open my door...
It felt as though they would break the door and come inside.
That was me. I came to check in on you.
but you closed the door. I was the one who was knocking.
Sister Salma, if it was you, then you should have told her that.
She was scared for so long and you didn't say anything.
The truth is that I was so afraid that I lost my voice.
My God! Go away from here!
Sit down here
Don't be afraid. Sister take me away from here. I won't stay here alone.
I asked Saqlain to let you stay with us.
Sure, alright. She can stay with us for a few days, this will stop making her afraid. But what will she do after that?
Brother Saqlain, what would I do here alone?
You know when mother was present I didn't even go to my room alone. 
And you know how afraid I feel to go to the roof in the evening.
Areeba, there is another solution for this. We can shift here.
But why?
Can't you see how afraid she is? This way she'll die out of fear.
No, we'll take here with us.
What would we do about this house then?
After knowing that your mother wasn't here anymore, someone tried to get in. What will we do if they manage to get inside next time?
Something like that won't happen.
It does, you just haven't seen how the world operates.
Us coming here, will empty our house.
Not a problem. We'll rent it out, or find some other solution for it.
Once she gets married, we'll shift back to our home.
Brother Saqlain is right.
Please stay with me. Thank God you picked up my phone...
I called sister Mahnoor as well, but she...
You called Mahnoor as well.
Yes... I did.
But, she didn't pick up.
She would have picked up if she cared. She knew that you were alone. The least she can do is pick up the phone.
Look at us, we came running here.
She was already so worried for you. She didn't even have dinner.
Don't worry...
We're shifting here. There's no need for you to worry anymore.
Alright?
I ruined your sleep.
No.
I just woke up.
Ramsha called me.
She hung up.
Maybe she's getting ready for university.
You can call her in the afternoon.
Yes... alright.
Nothing...
Alright.
Freshen up, I'll make breakfast.
Tea...
Sister...
Sister... I'll leave for university then.
When will you come back?
The usual time I come back from university.
Ramsha as far as I remember, you never come back home on time.
You were always late.
That's because I had classes that made me late.
Whatever the reason may be, from now on you will come back home directly from work.
Your sister gets worried.
Sure.
Hello...
Ramsha how are you? You were calling me? Is everything alright? 
That was about last night and that has passed.
Actually, my phone was in the room and I didn't know. Are you alright?
I'm fine and I'm alive.
There is no need for you to worry about me. Focus on your life.
Ramsha, what are you saying?
What happened last night that she called me? May God have mercy.
I hope everything's fine.
I'll get going, farewell.
Farewell.
Areeba, I think you need to keep an eye on Ramsha.
Try and understand that she's our responsibility. I don't people pointing fingers at us.
Understand?
Greetings...
Where were you?
I was stuck in traffic.
Anyways, good job. Here is your money.
Thank you very much, sir. Do I need to go to that house tonight?
No, you don't need to.
My work is done, you can go now.
Sure sir, remember me if you have something else.
Sure...
Ramsha, I wanted to call you because I wasn't able to talk to you then.
I wanted to call you and give you hope.
Then why didn't you call me?
It felt that you didn't want to talk to me.
No...
It's not like I didn't want to talk to you. Actually, I didn't know...
the situation you were in. Would you be able to talk to her or not...
I don't know. No one was with me.
No one.
In fact, after mother, it seems that I'm alone.
I can't even tell you what I faced last night. Both of my sisters went to their homes and left me alone.
And there were thieves at our house.
What are you saying? Did anything happen to you?
Your sister is so strange. In the beginning, I thought that you two were close.
Ramsha... do one thing... talk to your sister and stay with us for a few days.
You know that she will never do that.
Yes... maybe because of me... it's because she hates me.
Ramsha, how will you live alone under these circumstances?
God forbid if something happens...
I'm not alone sister Areeba and brother Saqlain are staying with me.
Don't think you're alone. I'm always with you. Trust me.
If you ever need anything, I'm right here.
What happened now? Why do you look so worried?
Your problems are disappearing one after another.
There are still a lot of problems.
The medicine that I gave auntie, Mahnoor has been sent for a lab test.
I don't know how I will handle the situation when the lab results come back.
Oh yes, that is problematic.
Through the reports, they will learn very easily that you mixed poison with the medicine.
Don't worry... I'll serve you tea before it gets cold.
What happened, are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
What will happen to me? I've gotten used to living without you.
Now our child has to get used to it.
Not at all. I won't let our child get out of my sight.
Once our child comes into this world, you'll see how much I'll pamper him.
Besides...
I'm doing all of this for our child.
Really? Are you doing all of it for our child? Will you do nothing for me?
No... it's nothing like that. What do you want?
I asked you to do one thing. I've asked Ramiz about that shop.
You didn't give me money for that.
I forgot about all these troubles.
I'm sorry.
I'll write you a check right now. You can give it to him tomorrow.
Here you go.
Happy?
Yes...
The tea will get cold, let me get it for you.
Let me do it.
Excuse me.
Hello...
Mahnoor, this is Dr. Sana speaking.
How are you?
I'm fine.
I can understand that your mother's sudden death was very shocking for you.
Do you remember that I asked you to have your mother's medicine lab tested?
Yes, I sent it to the lab the very same day.
Did you check the report? I've taken a look at it and you can see it online as well.
Can you come to the hospital for a while?
Is everything alright?
Come here, then we'll talk.
Sure... farewell.
What's the matter? Why did the doctor call you?
She wants to talk about medicine. In all the trouble I forgot to go there.
Alright then, I'll come with you.
Will you come with me?
Yeah sure.
