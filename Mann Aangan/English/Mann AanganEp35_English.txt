Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings to you too. Come in you two.
Mother, you're alone? Where's sister Areeba, has she left?
My dear, she just left... Saqlain wanted to stay but asked them to leave.
They were running late.
What happened to you? You don't seem well to me.
Are you alright?
Yes, I am... don't worry about me.
But you don't seem well.
It's just that I'm having a little difficulty breathing.
Mother, did you take your medicine?
Yes, my dear.
The medicine is right here. I ate it just before you guys arrived.
Then?
Let's take you to the doctor.
My dear... you'll find no doctor at this hour.
The emergency is open twenty-four hours.
Faraz is right. Get up, we're going to the doctor.
Mahi... my dear child, I'm perfectly fine. Why are you worrying so much about me?
I'm telling you that I'm fine, I don't want to go anywhere.
Mahnoor, you should stay here tonight.
Yes, I'll stay here with mother tonight.
No... both of you go home. You guys had to come here because of Ramsha.
There are so many things to do at one's home at this hour. I just took my medicine and I'm starting to feel better.
But mother...
Mahi, why are you being stubborn? Ramsha is here with me.
You don't seem well to me. If anything happens you'll call me, right?
Alright, my dear... I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry about me at all, alright?
We'll get going then. I'll ask Ramsha to keep your medicine by your side table.
I'll ask her to feed you something as well... because you don't take care of yourself.
Now rest up and go to sleep.
Sure... I'll sleep in a while. I feel better.
Farewell.
Farewell*
Mahnoor...
God willing, she'll be fine.
Ramsha... you didn't tell me how the engagement went by... everything was fine, right?
Everything was fine...
Did sister Shehla and Aima like the gifts you gave them?
What do you mean? They didn't open it there and then.
You can ask sister Mahnoor that.
Yes, I'll ask her.
Ramsha... Ramsha...
I can't breathe...
What do you mean you can't breathe?
I can't breathe...
What's happening... mother... mother!
Mother... mother... mother... you can't breathe...
Wait a minute, I'm calling sister Mahnoor.
Sister Mahnoor... I don't know what happened to mother. Please come home.
Yes... come here immediately... hurry up...
Please...
Mother...
Thank God... that everything went well.
But I didn't like how Faraz went to drop Ramsha on his wife's say-so.
Who would have dropped her then?
We had so many guests.
He could have gone later.
It was midnight and auntie wasn't feeling well.
Mother... mother... Mahnoor and I are leaving. Auntie has gotten unwell all of a sudden.
Alright...
Okay.
Do you see how they are leaving so early in the morning?
What's with your mother... he told you that auntie's unwell.
God... it seems that he only listens to his in-laws now.
This has happened twice since yesterday.
When I take this medicine... I feel suffocated...
I feel anxious and my heart feels heavy.
The doctor has prescribed her this medicine.
But... son... I have always been taking this medicine.
How can it be that the medicine isn't improving your health?
Rather, you're feeling suffocated.
This could be a reaction from this medicine as well.
I mean, often it happens that a certain medicine doesn't suit a certain person.
It's better that we refer this to the doctor. If this medicine isn't suiting you, they'll provide you with an alternative.
I told you earlier that you should go to the hospital, but you didn't listen to me.
But Mahi...
Enough mother...
I think we shouldn't delay this any longer, we should take her to the hospital.
I don't want things to go bad.
We're going to the hospital right now... I will not listen to you at all.
We're going to the hospital right now...  I've listened to you enough.
You're getting worse. Get up.
Mahi... you're doing this needlessly. I'm fine.
Enough Saqlain, I don't want to eat more.
You haven't eaten at all...
I can't eat anymore.
I will not tolerate anything like this, you have to be very careful. Your health is attached to the health of our child.
You're worrying for me because of the baby, otherwise, you don't care.
What do you mean I don't care?
You have no idea... I can't even get my mind on work nowadays.
I think about you all the time.
Fariya... my dear... Ramiz is here.
Ramiz is here?
Sit him down... we'll be just down.
Alright.
You remember your promise, right?
What need is there for this Fariya?
I told you that I'm willing to invest...
Please Saqlain this has already been settled between us.
Don't argue with me. I said I'll have a business of my own and I'll do exactly that.
Alright fine... finish this first and then you can meet him.
Open up...
No.. first agree with what I said. 
I have, now open up your mouth.
Sure?
Yes...
Let's go...
We'll leave after you finish this.
It's out of the question that this medicine causes a reaction.
Then, what is the reason?
Mother was perfectly fine, then how come all of a sudden she's like this?
We'll investigate this problem, don't worry.
But remove all doubt that she becomes unwell because of this medicine.
This medicine is trialed and tested. No side effects have ever been recorded regarding this medicine.
It's safe.
But we can't ignore this. Not once but twice she has had problems breathing after she took her medicine.
Besides she's a heart patient.
We have had some tests done, they'll be back in a couple of hours. After they come back we'll be able to come to a conclusion.
Your investment plan is good and the good thing is that the investment you want is not that much.
There is a lot of profit in this as well. How much will you invest?
Fifty... fifty. We decided that we would be equal partners.
Meaning that Fariya's investment will be fifty lacs.
Yes.
Do you guys have a location in mind? Where will your boutique be located?
We have a couple of prime locations that I've seen...
We can choose one from either of them.
If that's the case, finalize the location as soon as it's possible.
Fariya asked this of me and I can't refuse her.
Thank you...
My pleasure.
Excuse me...
Hello...
What do you mean? What happened to her health?
They got so unwell that Faraz and Mahnoor had to take her to the hospital?
Alright, don't worry. I'm coming.
Saqlain...
Where did he go?
Where else than that one place?
He ruined our entire plan. Stupid.
What did the doctor say?
They're waiting for her test results...
After that, she'll be treated.
What happened to her?
Mother had been unwell since yesterday. Mahnoor and Faraz brought her here.
She was unwell since yesterday and no one thought to inform us?
She wasn't that unwell yesterday, but she got worse today.
I'll go and talk to the doctor.
We've already talked to the doctor.
She said that we'll learn what the problem is after the test results come back.
I'll be right back.
What does mother's reports say?
Your mother's report is alarming. It's showing a chemical that's harmful to her body.
What?
But, how can that be?
It's written in this report.
That means that my mother has ingested something poisonous?
It's possible.
It's also possible that her medicine was tainted with this poison.
Because whenever she took this medicine her health got worse.
Doctor, this is the medicine you prescribed.
Why aren't you guys understanding that this medicine has nothing to do with this?
Then what other reason can it be?
Millions of people use this medicine, but there has never been such a case. I think her medicine is being laced with poison...
or she is being fed poison separately.
Right now, she needs to be treated and we don't have any time to lose.
Why are you talking to us then? Start her treatment immediately.
Mahnoor... send me all the medicine that miss Sarah was using, so that I can send it for testing in the lab.
So that you may be satisfied that the medicine we prescribed her, was not harmful to her.
I'll bring those medicine for you.
I just want my mother to be treated well.
I'll try my utmost best.
Faraz, I'll take these medicine to the lab. You can go home.
Why should I go home? Your mother's in the hospital and at such a time I can't leave you here.
Brother Saqlain is here with us at the hospital. You've been away from home for a while now. You need to look at matters there as well.
You have your mother as well.
Don't worry about my mother. You're already so stressed.
I talk to mother constantly. She knows about this emergency. Don't worry.
Shall we?
Let me keep this in my bag.
Where are the medicines?
Salma... Salma...
Salma!
Yes, brother Saqlain?
Where's auntie's medicine?
I think sister Mahnoor has already taken them with her.
Mahnoor...
She came here a while ago. I saw the medicine with her.
Brother Saqlain, sister Mahnoor asked to make food for everyone. If you could wait five minutes, it will be ready and I'll pack it up for you.
Where's Mahnoor?
She's gone out with Faraz to take care of something.
Gone out?
Your mother is fighting life and death, but your sister is roaming around.
Slowly... it might be something important.
It's strange...
Your sister does not care about your mother at all. They've left her here.
We are responsible for everything. Ramsha and Mahnoor are not capable of handling any responsibility.
She's roaming out with her husband.
I've sent Ramsha to the cafeteria for tea.
For tea? Is this a picnic?
Why are you being so angry?
What happened to mother's reports? Mahnoor didn't tell me anything as well. She just left.
Auntie's reports...
Where did you two go? Why are you two so late? I was worried. Do you guys realize your responsibilities?
Is mother fine?
Yes, the doctors gave her an injection. She asked us...
not to leave her alone, even for a second. Where did you two go?
I went to have mother's medicine lab tested.
Lab test, for what?
The doctor suspects that mother's medicines are laced with medicine, that's why they want to check her medicine.
They want to find the poisonous chemical that is making her sick.
They want to make sure that there isn't anything like that in her medicine.
That will be cleared once the reports are back.
Don't worry, God willing, auntie will be fine soon.
If God is willing.
Relax...
Brother, don't worry. I'll tell mother everything.
Just take care of sister Mahnoor. Farewell.
Hello...
I've been trying to reach you for a while...
but your number was engaged.
Yes...
Don't you recognize me? It's Yasir.
No, I did... I saw your number...
Yes, I decided to see how you were doing...
but your phone was busy, so I got irritated. Who were you talking to for so long?
I was talking to brother Faraz... sister Mahnoor's mother is not feeling well. That's why he didn't come home today.
It seems that you like talking for long hours on the phone.
But I've never seen you talk to someone for long.
It depends on the nature of the conversation. I don't like talking needlessly.
But I like listening to you.
That's why you can say whatever you want to me... but try not to keep your phone engaged for so long.
But now I can call you at any time.
Sure. I have to give brother Faraz's message to my mother. I'll talk to you later.
Alright fine, messaged me. If I'm free I'll call you.
Farewell.
Did you talk to Faraz?
Yes...
Brother Faraz said that he won't be coming today. Sister Mahnoor's mother is not well at all.
He'll stay there. Sister Mahnoor is very upset.
That's all he cares about. He won't leave her, even if it means cutting himself from the world.
My poor son must be in dire condition from being at the hospital since morning.
That selfish woman didn't even think of sending him home so that he can rest.
Go ahead and pray.
Should I bring you something to eat?
Auntie will be perfectly fine.
The doctors have started the treatment.
There's no danger.
You're brave and strong...
Be strong for just a little while longer.
You'll see auntie...
By tomorrow morning she'll be back home.
Hello...
Saqlain, where are you?
Where else can I be but in trouble?
What trouble? Is everything fine?
These women have made my life hell. I'm in the hospital with this old hag.
Saqlain, you still care about Areeba and her mother. You don't care about me and my soon-to-be-born child.
Whether we live or die.
What foolish things are you saying?
Why wouldn't I care about you and my child? I've waited years for this moment.
I've gotten such good news after such a long time, won't I be happy?
What should I do about this old hag? I can't leave her here to come to you.
Lord knows when she'll die.
I tried killing her by lacing her medicine with poison.
She's been a bother for such a long time. I decided that when she would die I would take over her house, on which I have always had my eyes.
But...
But what?
Blood reports have caught a trace of that poison.
Mahnoor has already sent the medicine to be tested.
I don't understand how I will handle this situation. They'll know that the medicine was laced with poison.
Saqlain...
Auntie... why did you remove your mask?
All these years I was unable to see your true face.
What are you saying, auntie?
It seems that the medicine has affected your brain.
No... nothing has happened to me.
Nothing has happened to me... I heard everything you were saying.
You betrayed me...
Such a great betrayal.
You married someone else.
And... you have a child as well.
Such a great betrayal.
I always treated you like a son, why did you do this to me?
Auntie, you have a misunderstanding.
I've just now started seeing the truth.
It's my fault that I...
trusted you so much.
Saqlain... I thought of you like a son and you...
What did you do to me? Why did you do this to me?
You wanted money...
You wanted my money... that's why you poisoned me.
Mahi... Mahi...
Mahi... was right. I never believed what Mahi said.
I believed you Saqlain...
Mahi... Mahi...
Mahi was right. Mahi.. Mahi... Mahi.
Mahi... Mahi...
Look at her... nothing's active.
Please look at her.
What happened to you? Wake up.
Brother Saqlain...
What happened to mother?
It was a heart attack.
Heart attack?
But how?
I don't know, when I went to her room she was in a dire state. I called the doctor...
What happened to her?
Mother...
Please be okay.
What happened?
I'm sorry.
Mother...
Mother...
Mother... mother open up your eyes. What happened to you?
Mother, talk to me... you can't leave me like this. Talk to me.
You can't leave...
Mahnoor... what happened to her?
Mother isn't saying anything.
Mother...
Where's the staff? Mother open up your eyes...
Mother... see what happened to her?
Mother... she's not opening up her eyes.
Mother...
No... no...
No... you can't leave us like this. Please talk to me.
