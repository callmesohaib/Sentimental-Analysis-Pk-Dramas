Had I met Ramsha, I would have found out if she's okay. Even Mahnoor is worried. She was saying..
Has she been sent to jail?
What has happened that you and Mahnoor are so worried about her well being? She just met you guys yesterday.
All of a sudden, how will she get better with you guys? And think about it.
If Touqeer finds out that Ramsha wasn't happy with this proposal then what will you do? And what if he finds out the reason?
No. He shouldn't find out. Its best if its always hidden. This is for Ramsha's and our respect.
Then be strong and be at peace. Let her be at peace as well. Give her time to adjust. What if you go there and she just lets go. As far as her well being is concerned..
I meet Touqeer everyday, I'll ask about her. Don't worry. Touqeer will take care of her.
Now can I have breakfast.
Yes of course.
Thank you.
Oh. What brings you people here early in the morning?
Hello.
Hello. Please sit.
Actually we brought breakfast for Ramsha. That's why we came early in the morning.
I hope you people didn't have breakfast.
No we didn't have breakfast yet but why this formality? You people didn't have to.
This isn't about formality but traditions and traditions keep families close.
This means, you believe in traditions. But yesterday I thought you didn't believe in such traditions.
You rejected the gift I gave you.
You saw that. She said no.
Yes I remember. Ramsha? Where is Ramsha? Ramsha?
She's in the bedroom upstairs. Although she knows you're here but she didn't think its feasible to come down.
Hmm.. You should go and meet Ramsha yourself.
Yes. If you don't mind Touqeer, can I go and meet Ramsha in your room.
Of course. Sajida?
Yes sir?
She is Ramsha's sister. Please take her to Ramsha's room to meet her.
Please have juice. You people brought so much and aren't taking anything yourself.
No. Thank you.
Yes. I'm busy. I'll come to the office in a while. Yes, I'll look at the quotations in the office. 
Okay. Bye.
Ramsha?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to meet you. How are you?
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't say like this. Stop being angry now.
Don't you remember I swore I'd never see my sisters ever again?
This can never be. You're are sister.
Your sister is dead.
Because you ended the relationship yourself and dug up its grave.
This relationship can never end.
This talk doesn't suit you. You're two faced. I'll never forgive you for what you did with me.
Is Touqeer good? Does he take care of you?
What difference does it make?
And what right do you have to ask me this?
See, I understand. Come downstairs Faraz is here to meet you.
We brought breakfast for you.
I don't want to meet anyone. Leave my room right now. Leave.
Have you lost your mind? Don't create a scene of our relationship in front of Touqeer.
Leave.
Because all of you made a spectacle of my life. Leave. I don't want to talk to anyone. Leave.
And after today, don't come here. 
Listen to me. Ramsha.. Ramsha, look...
Ramsha? Open the door and listen to me. Ramsha?
Don't do this. Listen to me Ramsha.
Ramsha see. Ramsha, I cannot leave you alone like this. Ramsha?
Maheer?
Yes mam?
You cannot take this class.
I cannot take this class? But why mam?
Please go to the admin office, you'll know everything.
But what did I do mam that I have to go to the admin's office?
Please Maheer. Don't waste my time. You can leave this class.
Okay students. Today we're going to study business management.
Did you meet Ramsha?
Yes.
How is Ramsha?
She is upset with you people.
No actually.. I think we should leave.
Oh but why are you people leaving?
You didn't even have something when you brought everything along.
No. We'll come some other time. Please let us take your leave.
Alright, as you wish.
Thank you. I have a request. Please take care of Ramsha.
She's very sensitive.
She's very innocent. Just be loving with her.
Yes of course. Don't worry about this.
Lets leave. Bye.
Bye.
Sajida?
Take this trash away and dump it anywhere. Do what you want. I don't want to see it.
And if Ramsha's family visits next time. Don't let them come inside without asking me. Tell the guard as well.
Faraz.. I gave you an extra phone.
Yes, its here.
Here.
I brought it to give it to Ramsha. I forgot. I'll just come.
What is this Ramsha? Why did they come to my house early in the morning? I don't like people invading my privacy.
They'll not come after today.
It would be best for them. I didn't let them realize because it was the first time. Sort out your problems on the phone.
And why do they have to interfere in your life? You're married now.
Another thing, the way I'll take care of you and whether I should love you or not, I know very well. Nobody needs to tell me that.
Tell your sister, whenever you talk to her. Never to dictate me. I don't like it. Idiots!
You? 
Yes. Can you give this phone to Ramsha?
Yes I will.
Thank you.
Please take care of Ramsha.
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.
Thank you.
Faraz? Lets go.
Yes, did you give the phone to Ramsha?
No I gave it to their maid. Lets go home, I want to talk to Areeba and Saqlain.
What will you talk about? Nothing can be done.
Do you know Touqeer... I'll tell you on way. Lets go.
Excuse me. I want to meet Sir Rizwan.
Please wait.
Sure.
Hello sir, there is a student to meet you.
What is your name?
Maheer.
Sir, its Maheer. Okay sir. Please go inside.
Thank you.
Sir, may I come in?
Yes.
Sir, Mam Nusrat threw me out of her class. I don't understand.
You cannot be in Nusrat's or any other class.
You have been rusticated from the university.
But why sir?
You and Ramsha, both have been rusticated.
But sir..
This is your letter. And you should not be seen in the university premises again. Take your letter. This is my warning.
But sir, what is my fault? It was my personal matter and you know I'm a good student. I have a scholarship.
Your personal reputation wasn't good for our institution. First you ran away with a girl who was a student from here and then the police arrested you.
And a convicted person has no future in our university. We have good students here, not people like you.
But sir...
You may go now.
It is very weird Areeba. Both of them just went to their house early in the morning without informing.
And now they're worried that why was he upset that they visited. He's a big man and he has a personal life.
Nobody can just barge into their house.
It was not just anybody. It was me. Ramsha's sister and her brother in law.
Not just anybody barged in there that he was taunting her.
It is pretty weird. He shouldn't have minded. They're relatives..
Wow.
Not everybody is like Saqlain that they can accept everything. People react about things they don't like.
And as it is, Touqeer didn't misbehave with you. He must have been hospitable.
And Ramsha? Why was he insulting Ramsha? He pretended to be very well mannered in front of us.
And then he insulted her as we left.
And God knows what he must have hidden from us. And there was none of his relatives in the wedding.
Now you'll make this an issue.
He has nobody as a family. What will he do? Even I don't have anyone.
But you have an aunt..
I mean you have your relatives.
Its all Mahnoor's fault. Why did she have to eavesdrop on them in their room.
This is against ethics. A husband and wife talks about everything. Don't we both argue?
And yes, as it is, the entire neighborhood can hear her husband arguing.
Saqlain please. I'm warning you. I'll not tolerate if you use this as an excuse to insult Faraz.
First of all you got her married in a rush.
We got her married to a rich man, with respect.
Otherwise the disrespect your sister was going to get us all, I saved you from it and I wronged her. Wow.
Areeba I told you, I was against it. 
He's not only rich but he is also older than Ramsha.
You are as it is jealous of his money. You don't just feel for Ramsha.
It was your younger brother who got us disrespected.
And now you have a problem with his age. Wow. Its the limit. You cannot create an issue about just anything.
Saqlain..
And what happened that they had to come here early in the morning? Mahnoor..
Sisters hides things for sisters to let them stay happily married and you're here to scare us early in the morning and Touqeer is being mean to Ramsha.
He might have just told her off because of you.
It is Ramsha's fault. Had she talked to you on phone, Touqeer wouldn't have been upset.
This is the problem. Nobody sees themselves and blames others. What do you want now? Should I go and argue with Touqeer?
Should I get Ramsha divorced so that you can get your goon of a brother to marry Ramsha for the second time?
Do you even think before speaking?
Faraz.. 
Mahnoor its best if you don't interfere in Ramsha's life and her marriage. You never did anything for her. I had to take the entire responsibility.
In fact, it is your fault to bring things till here. Saqlain tried hard to find a solution to all these problems.
And if things have settled, let them stay settled.
Am I spoiling things?
Yes. Saqlain is looking into everything. He knows Touqeer very well. He'll keep Ramsha happy.
God forbid, if Touqeer finds out about her past because of you.. If she comes back here after she's married..
We will be in trouble. You got me trapped earlier and left yourself. Its best if you go back home and let us live in peace.
Leave everything. Don't get worried.
Didn't I tell you it will be useless? The way Saqlain is he'll never let himself be blamed. He just distracts everyone.
What will we do? Should we leave Ramsha as it is and see how Touqeer treats her?
But Faraz what can I do?
I cannot not care about Ramsha. I cannot abandon her like Areeba.
Just pray that Ramsha contacts you and uses the phone you gave her. Because after hearing Touqeer I don't think you should contact her. And what if Touqeer..
doesn't let you talk to her, next time.
The way I should care for you, whether I should love you or not, nobody needs to tell me that. Tell your sister this when you talk to her.
She shouldn't be dictating me. I don't like it.
Mam, I've served breakfast, sir is calling you.
Tell him that I don't want breakfast.
Mam your sister gave this when she left. She asked me to give this to you.
Breakfast?
Please tell him I don't want breakfast.
Should I tell you something mam.. I haven't been here for long but,
maybe you don't know. Sir has anger issues. He minds things quickly. Please listen to me and come for breakfast.
Sure.
Alright. You go ahead..
So did you meet your sister in law? You must be satisfied that she's fine and happy.
If you could now give us some time and listen to us and our worries. Maybe you could ask what happened with your brother?
Why? What happened?
They rusticated him from the university. His education is over. His future is destroyed, because of her sister.
And what about Ramsha's life that has been destroyed because of him?
He is responsible for his future himself.
What do you mean?
He wasted my entire year worth of hard work. I worked so hard for his bright future.
I thought he'd get a degree from a reputable institute so he will not have to face problems in the future but he chose problems for himself.
Its because of him I'm embarrassed everywhere. I'm ashamed to call him my brother.
Faraz be quiet. He's already worried. We will do one thing. We'll visit Maheer's university.
We'll request the admin to change their decision and cancel his rustication.
Mahnoor you have no idea, such decisions in such institutions are not an individual's doing. They also don't take back their decisions if someone request.
Oh, but you should talk. Maybe Mahnoor is right and they can hear if you request.
Hmm. They might.
Mahnoor and I are only left to beg. Be it police, be it people.
Its because of him, Mahnoor's sister and brother in law have been insulting us.
Why do you go there to get insulted? Who asks you to go?
If only you had objected to what Maheer did, things wouldn't have reached this point.
Oh. Whats wrong with him? He has never been so angry. What did he have inside that it erupted like a volcano?
It is your fault. Your fault. You don't worry about the house and you have him entangled too. I ask you,
why did you have to take him to your sister's house? Was it your responsibility or was it Faraz's duty to take breakfast for her?
Aunty Faraz himself said..
Put it on Faraz. As if I don't know you.
Leave now. Why are you looking at my face?
What had I thought and what happened? I had dreamt that this boy would grow up to become an officer.
I'm sorry. Its because of me you got insulted. All of you have to tolerate so much. I'm responsible for all this.
A person gets punished for what he did. Its nobody's fault.
Maheer is getting punished for his mistakes and he will keep paying for them.
Don't say like this. He's your brother.
I'm going through my sister's pain but I've wanted bad for Maheer.
Do you even realize how much I struggled for him and I still am.
I know.
I never valued myself. I worked hard for my family.
Don't worry. We will find a solution.
What will happen? He can appear for private exams. Nothing more can be done.
This boy and his stubborn, stupid attitude spoilt his entire career. And its not that nobody ever stopped or guided him. You did, mom did. I did.
But he never listened.
And Saqlain.. he taunts me because of him.
Faraz don't think about Saqlain. You know very well how he is. He just needs a chance to show others down.
And I feel that you said a lot to aunty today.
She must be hurt. Go and apologize to her. We shouldn't hurt our mothers.
Where are you going? 
I'm going to the office. Where else?
I was thinking we would go and meet Ramsha.
What is wrong that you want to meet Ramsha. As it is, Mahnoor went there early in the morning.
No. She doesn't have a phone. If I could talk, I'll be satisfied. 
I have her phone. I'll hand it over if I visit.
And you and Mahnoor need to be careful about one thing. Let Ramsha be for some time. She will have to live by this relationship now. She has already done enough.
That's true but you should see. We cannot just abandon Ramsha.
Areeba I've known Touqeer for years.
What if you give her a hand and she comes back with you. What will you do?
God forbid.
I never wanted to agree to this match. I agreed because of you. Please don't spoil anything now.
I'm not saying this. I just said that we should just go once.
I know Areeba you're worried for Ramsha.
And Mahnoor has told you more.
Don't worry. I'll meet Touqeer and mention it to him in good taste. What else can I do?
Alright.
Alright. You wanted to go home.
Yes. So should I start packing?
No. Not yet. I want to get some renovation done.
Renovation?
Yes renovation. I wanted to extend the first floor and get some work done on the ground floor as well.
Our house is good. Why do we need to renovate?
Cane we not perfect something that's good?
I'm doing it for your ease. As it is, the labor can work there since you're here. If they work in your presence, you'll be hassled.
Alright. As you say.
Alright. I'll leave now. Take care.
You too.
