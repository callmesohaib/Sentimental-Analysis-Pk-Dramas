Hello Mr. Touqeer.
Hello Saqlain. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
Everything is fine. Sit down.
Thank you.
How was your flight? I hope everything was good.
Everything was good.
Yes I think this time you're here for a long time. I had an idea after our last conversation on the phone.
Do you know I always have something or the other going on in my life?
But right now I'm on vacation. There are a few things I'm thinking about but I need to be sure of them before going ahead.
You know my habits.
Yes. I know all your habits very well.
And you don't have to worry. Everything will be arranged for.
I know.
Your friendship has always been beneficial for me. I trust you blindly.
Did you have breakfast?
Not really. But tell me, how is everybody at home?
I told you I'm on vacation.
I'm sorry.
Now that you mention your family, I think you've never made me meet your family. Neither have you ever invited me at your house.
Hmm. Its nothing like that. You can come whenever you like. Its like your own house.
Alright then. You decide the day and time. I'll come.
As you say Touqeer.
Now lets order. Excuse me? I had ordered our drinks.
You know my taste very well.
Time teaches us a lot of things.
Bring the menu please.
I am looking at a factory location.
If you can scrutinize it, we can discuss.
Why not Touqeer? I have a few locations in mind. Let me line them up and then we'll go check them out.
Faraz? Why are you behaving like this?
If you want I will apologize to aunty.
Its your wish.
You don't know the entire thing and this is why you don't understand the situation.
Then you tell me everything. What is it that's bothering you and making you so insecure?
A few days ago, I came home to pick a file for work.
And Maheer had brought Ramsha home at that time. And do you know neither Aima, nor aunty was home.
Had aunty or Aima seen Ramsha at home, what would they think about her?
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
How could Maheer do such a  thing? I'll talk to him..
Wait. Its not only Maheer's fault. Ramsha is equally responsible.
This is why its important to stop them. If Saqlain finds out, God knows what he will do.
At least have breakfast before you leave.
I don't feel like it.
Listen, don't worry.
People say we definitely get whats written in our fate.
You'll see, God will benefit your business so much that your loss will turn into a profit.
As God wills.
I pray to God that it happens.
I wanted to ask you something.
What is it tell me?
Your friend was coming for dinner tonight, will he come?
He will come.
Alright.
Bye.
Bye.
Saqlain is already worried otherwise I would have fixed you by telling him what you did.
What is wrong, why have you started doubting me so much?
I have really not done anything.
Just focus on your studies or else I'll be forced to take an immediate decision.
I just want to get you married so that I can be rid of you and go back to my house.
Please..
He isn't answering. God knows what you said to Yasir.
Mom, I didn't say anything. You can ask Mahnoor yourself.
This means Mahnoor knows everything as well.
Have some fear. You advertise it for everyone. Can't you keep some things to yourself?
Here, take this phone and congratulate and wish Yasir on his birthday.
Did he answer?
See, he replied. See what is it?
You were just upset without any reason that he wasn't answering your calls.
He must have been busy thats why he didn't answer.
Ramsha, the screen is broken. Its alright, I'll get it repaired.
How much will it cost?
What do you need to know for? I'll get it done.
Hmm. Actually Saqlain hasn't handed me my pocket money yet and I'm out of cash.
Ramsha come on, it won't cost hundred thousands. And of course since it broke because of me, I'll change it.
In fact do one thing. Manage until tomorrow. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.
Okay. I will.
Thank you.
Its okay. As it is, I can do anything for you.
Ramsha tell me, what can you do for me?
Anything.
Anything? What do you mean?
I mean stupid I love you so much that I can give you my life if you ask for it. You just have to ask.
The thing that is mine, why should I ask you for it?
But tell me one thing, how much do you trust me?
More than myself.
Will you be with me no matter what the situation is?
Always.
Sure?
Hmm.
Promise?
Promise.
Good.
How are you feeling now?
I'm fine. I'm still alive.
I was very stressed yesterday.
I said so much to you because I was worried.
I didn't even think that the loss that we met, wasn't only mine.
It was ours.
Thank God. At least you realize my pain.
Do you have any address for Rameez?
Rameez's address?
Yes I do but he must have left by now.
You must have forgotten. I told you he lived with his friend as a paying guest.
Alright. 
What alright?
I'll find him. I'll get all my money back from him.
He must have left the city.
If he's in the country, he cannot hide from Saqlain.
Oh well.
Now you should take good care of yourself.
I'm sorry once again.
Its okay.
Aima, why are you sitting here?
Just like that.
Are you crying?
No.
Look at me.
What happened? Did aunty say something to you?
Did Yasir say something?
I told you to ask aunty to talk to him.
He didn't even answer her calls.
Maybe you should have let aunty gone on his birthday.
Perhaps Yasir didn't like that. He is your fiance.
Its nothing wrong if you met him.
Look at the messages he sent me.
This is very wrong. Who talks like this?
You don't know.
He humiliates me and taunts me.
I'm stupid and insensible which is why my mom is rushing to get me married.
Had I had any capabilities, she would have allowed me to study more. Girls who are smart and intelligent, their parents allow them for higher education.
Yasir knows how much I asked mom to agree.
So much is happening. Why don't you tell aunty about it?
I tried talking to mom. Everytime she says that he must be joking. In fact she encourages me to talk to him.
So that I can control him once we get married. Tell me yourself, how can someone control a person like him?
And to be honest I don't want to control him. You don't have an idea how much humiliation I feel. How much disrespected I feel.
You're right. I can understand. No matter what the relationship is. Its very important to give respect to one another.
Nobody can disrespect you, especially the person you're thinking to spend your life with.
Don't worry. I'll talk to Faraz. Come on. Good.
Who came at this hour?
You? Why are you here?
What do you mean why am I here?
Didn't Fariya ask you not to come here?
I want to talk to Fariya. Where is she?
Saqlain is with her and Saqlain knows about yours and Fariya's affair.
How did he find out?
Let that be. But Saqlain is no less than a brute right now.
Whatever my child is going through, she's bearing it. But if he sees you here, he'll not spare anyone.
I cannot leave Fariya on Saqlain's mercy.
She will handle him. She can calm him down.
But you leave from here or else Saqlain will shoot us all. Go away.
I'll come later.
Listen, call before you come. Do you understand? Now go.
Why are you standing in my way? Move.
Move. Why are you blocking my way?
No. Nothing.
How many times have I stopped you? How many times have I told you this is for your own good?
I will not hear another word. Do you think all of us are insensible and you're the one whom God has given all the sense?
Had you a little sense, you would have understand that you don't deserve Maheer.
I'm warning you..
I will not hear another word against Maheer. 
And I will not tolerate you saying anything against him.
Faraz told you everything?
 Faraz didn't tell me anything. In fact Faraz argued with Maheer because of you and I heard them.
Its because of there are fights in my house.
Because of me?
Yes because of you. I'm tired of trying to make you understand but you..
What happened? You two are fighting?
 I don't know. Ask her.
Whenever she comes she fights with me. I don't know what problem she has with me.
Ramsha? Mahnoor?
Nothing.
I heard, the two of you were fighting.
Actually I was trying to make her understand but she thought I was arguing. She's young.
What is it? What was the argument about?
Nothing at all.
Then why did you attack Ramsha? What happened?
See Mahnoor whatever the problem is, tell us on time because once time passes by, all that is left is regret.
There will be no regret. Don't worry. Its between Ramsha and I. I'll handle it.
I'll leave now. Bye.
Bye.
I could hear them fighting outside and she said they weren't arguing.
Yes I was also in the kitchen. I didn't hear anything.
I asked but she didn't tell so I don't know..
Do you want to talk to me?
Yes I want to talk about Aima.
Aima? What happened to Aima?
Aima is worried because of Yasir.
She cannot understand Yasir.
Does Aiman not like Yasir?
Nobody can like a person who doesn't respect her and doubts her about everything.
Someone who has a lot of mood swings.
Is this how Yasir behaves with Aima?
I thought both of them needed to give time to each other. I told Aima to give Yasir some time and that he'd understand.
But Yasir isn't ready to understand Aima.
Now I feel Yasir doesn't want to understand her. Please talk to aunty.
Two people cannot spend life together if they don't want a relationship or if they don't want to compromise.
Its about Aima's whole life.
Ramsha? Where is Areeba?
Yes, I'm here. I was waiting for you.
Is your friend coming today?
Yes he'll be here in a while.
I've made some good arrangements for dinner.
Alright.
I was thinking I'd go home.
What do you need to do there?
Actually I need a few things. Everything is there. I thought I'd go and get it.
Tell me, are you giving the house on rent. Should I...
Why are you so worried about the house all of a sudden?
I will give it on rent when I have time. I'm stuck right now. You do know I suffered a loss of five million.
People get a heart attack after suffering such a big loss.
God forbid. What are you saying?
Leave everything. I'll see if I need to give it on rent or if I need to sell it, when I have time.
Why do we need to sell it? Where will we live?
Why?
Where we're living, isn't this a house? You do know I suffered a loss of five million. I need money to invest in my business.
I need sources. Earlier I sold your shops to invest the money and now again..
God will handle everything. He'll find a way. I'm going to change.
Did Saqlain sell your shops?
Yes.
He needed the money.
I want you to call Yasir at home. I want to talk to him.
What will you talk to him about?
About his attitude with Aima. Aima doesn't like it.
Who told you that?
Aima doesn't like that?
Mom, I live in the same house. If you don't tell me, will I not find out what the problem is?
It was Yasir's birthday today.
Yes.
And he invited Aima?
Yes but I stopped her right there because I know you wouldn't like Aima meeting Yasir alone.
No. I will never allow for this.
Mom knows, brother. Ask her how Yasir humiliates me.
She has lost her mind. She doesn't know the difference between jokes and insult. He said a few things and she minded them.
He doesn't have a right to jokingly insult Aima. If he does this before the wedding, what will he do after?
Nothing will happen after the wedding, everything will be fine. This period between engagement and wedding causes arguments. Everything will be alright.
I made a mistake. I shouldn't have allowed Aima to talk to Yasir on the phone. Your wife has encouraged her and spoiled everything.
Mom, why are you blaming Mahnoor without any reason? Don't you see Aima's face and realize how unhappy she is.
I just want you to call Yasir and his mother home.
What would that do?
You will spoil everything.
Your haste spoiled everything. I did stop you but you didn't.
Oh well. Do what I'm saying. Call them home so that we should talk to him and make him realize his attitude.
Come. Please. Come. This is my humble abode.
I hope I wasn't late.
Oh no. You're not late. You're right on time.
There was a lot of traffic and I stopped by to get some gifts for your family.
You didn't have to do this brother, Touqeer.
I came to your for the first time, I couldn't come empty handed.
Its like your own house. You can come whenever you please.
Come inside. Why are you standing? Come.
Your house is very pretty. I like it. 
Thank you so much. Please sit down. I'll call Areeba.
Areeba. Here..
Hello.
Hello.
Touqeer this is my wife, Areeba.
How are you?
I'm fine. What about you?
Thank God. These are a few gifts for you. Please keep them.
Thank you so much. But you didn't have to be so formal.
Its nothing.
Areeba, ask Salma, to get juice.
I can't get the AC in my room to work. I don't know..
You have guests. I'll come later.
Wait. She is my younger sister, Ramsha. Ramsha..
this is Mr. Touqeer. Saqlain's friend.
Hello.
Hello.
I'll get juice.
Sure.
I'll also leave.
Where are you going? Sit down.
Yes?
Please sit.
Sit down.
Have a seat.
So what do you do?
I? 
What do you do?
I'm doing my MBA.
MBA? Very impressive. 
She's very intelligent.
Praise be to the Lord.
Mr. Touqeer you mentioned that you wanted to set up a factory here, what about it?
Yes..
I'm thinking about it.
Mahnoor. Wait.
Why did you have to tell everything to Faraz?
Aima is worried.
That's why.
I know how much you want good for Aima.
God knows what you're filling in her brain.
I've never misguided Aima. I've always wanted the best for her.
Alright, this is how you want the best of her? She has begun to dislike Yasir.
You know very well why she dislikes Yasir.
Whatever relationship I have with Aima but she is your daughter. Do you want Aima to live in a relationship where she doesn't get love or respect?
Where she gets insulted jokingly and she bears everything. I don't want Aima's engagement with Yasir to be called off.
I just want all misunderstandings to be cleared. This is why I discussed everything with Faraz.
Mahnoor, when things reach men, there is an argument and I don't want..
Aima is your daughter.
But she is Faraz's sister as well. Faraz cares about Aima as much as you do and then,
you'll be there. If you think something is wrong, you can stop or explain him there and then. You're the elder.
I'll think about it.
I've done recce for some locations for your factory. I'll show you and yes..
I am thinking about a factory but there is something in my mind. Investment is not an issue but I'm thinking, alone,
I cannot handle everything.
Why are you worried? I'm here. I'll help you wherever you need help.
Yes. I can trust you blindly.
Lets do one thing. When we meet next we'll discuss then.
Sure. As you like.
I've served dinner.
Mr. Touqeer we have dinner served. Please come.
Why did you have to be so formal?
Its nothing formal. Its your own house. Will you not have dinner here? Come.
Alright. Thank you.
Please. Come. Please sit.
Please start.
Will the rest of the family not have dinner with us?
The entire family is here. 
I'm talking about your wife's little sister. Will she not have dinner?
Oh yes. She'll have dinner later.
Yes. She'll have dinner later. Please start.
I think you're being formal because of me. If that's so, please don't.
No. Its nothing. You're like a family member to us.
You call me your family member.
And then a member of the family is missing from the dinner table. This isn't right Saqlain.
You're right.
Areeba, go and call Ramsha. Tell her to come and have dinner with us.
Sure. I'll call her.
Please start at least.
Yes, thank you.
He is such a weird man and he was looking at me with such creepy eyes and Saqlian didn't even say anything.
Why isn't the AC working? Please start.
Ramsha, come and have dinner.
I'm not hungry, please eat.
Saqlain is calling and Mr. Touqeer is asking about you.
Why is Mr. Touqeer calling me? I mean what will I do there?
He thinks we're being formal because of him. You're not hungry. Its okay. Just sit with us for a while.
I'm not hungry, what will I do there?
Ramsha, Saqlain is calling.
Should I tell him you're not coming. Come on its dinner time. Sit for five ten minutes and come back. You're always in your room.
Come and have dinner with us sometime. Come on.
Alright. You go. I'm coming.
You won't work...
