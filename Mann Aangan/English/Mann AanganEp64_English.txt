Mahnoor, I'm going far away from you. 
You were right, you have no place for me in your heart.
When we met last time I saw...
that I wasn't there in your eyes...
My heart has been broken...
but one thing is sure, Faraz has made his place in your heart.
I just want to see you happy.
If possible, forgive me...
Farewell, Wasay.
Ramsha this is your last semester, please complete your degree.
I don't want to.
Please don't force me, I don't want to go to university.
She's gone insane. Make her understand.
Don't worry about her, I'll make her understand. Say what's on your mind.
How can I not? I'm worried about both of you.
I have to leave for Lahore for training and I can't leave you guys alone. I shouldn't go.
Mahnoor, you've struggled so much, if you don't go there, after coming so near...
then Ramsha and I won't like it at all, right?
Sister is right.
After working so hard, you should go.
What's with us, we'll take care of ourselves. Don't worry.
Concentrate on your studies.
How are you, sir?
Please, keep sitting.
I decided to congratulate you.
Thank you, sir.
Faraz, you are a hardworking and patient man, and I know your importance.
I know how long you've waited to get this position.
The best thing is that you've never brown-nosed anyone to sit on this chair.
Sir, my wife...
That is something to be proud of...
You supported your wife. You were not jealous of her and supported her career.
Your contribution is equal to Mahnoor's.
Yes sir... I think that the position I'm in...
Mahnoor has contributed to it as well.
Good people deserve good people. Wish you the best of luck.
I hope that you will keep progressing like this.
Yes, definitely.
Tell me, how's Mahnoor and how's her training?
She's fine... thank God... you know how tough the training is.
Obviously. Please greet her for me.
Sure sir...
Have a nice day.
You too sir.
Ramsha, forget everything like a bad dream.
Brother Faraz...
is it easy to forget all this?
I know...
it's very hard, but everything becomes easier when one tries.
So much time has passed as well.
Ramsha... Mahnoor is very worried because of you.
I promised Mahnoor that I will convince you.
But...
We should not pay heed to other people's words.
Who are these people who will question you?
But...
Enough... I will not hear any excuses. I've brought this form.
Fill it up and sign them.
Brother Faraz...
When will sister be back?
Next week.
And... when will the training be over?
The training is for a year.
Why don't you ask your sister that?
I think that she must not have time, that's why I don't ask her.
Yes, she is very busy.
Alright, I should get going.
If you have anything for me...
please call me, I'll be here.
So you've finally convinced Ramsha.
Yes!
She was being stubborn for no reason.
Now, her semester is about to start, so prepare for it.
Sure.
Thank you, Faraz.
Mahnoor isn't here, and still, you take such good care of us.
There's nothing to thank for.
Whether Mahnoor is here or not...
I have a relationship with you two, and I must take care of you two.
How are you?
Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Was I late?
No, my class just ended.
Good.
You guys go.
How are you, Ramsha?
I'm fine...
It makes me happy to see you returning to life.
By the way, this is your best decision.
My van is here.
Bye*
He is so cute. Hold your son.
If only mother was alive today.
She would have been so happy looking at him.
Mother is here, with us.
Because her prayers are with us.
I'm thinking of extending my holiday because I don't feel like going back.
I will miss all of you.
I think that you should have yourself posted here.
All of you miss you here.
If only it were in my control. But I will try.
I'll miss that little one and all of you.
You're fulfilling such a big dream...
is that not enough for your happiness?
Your happiness has been fulfilled as well.
You always wanted this as well.
Now I have to live for him.
And you have to stay happy for him as well.
If God is willing.
If God is willing.
Sister Salma! Sister Areeba where are you guys? Come here!
You're back?
Yes, why is it so silence at home?
Where's sister Areeba?
She's at the hospital. Sister Mahnoor took her in the morning.
Sister Mahnoor? When did she come back? And how's sister Areeba?
Thank God everything is fine, by God's good grace you've become an aunt.
Really?
Sister Areeba just had a son.
Surprisingly, no one told me.
They were calling you, but your phone was switched off.
My phone... you know my phone is switched off in classes. It's even switched off right now.
I think I should go to the hospital. I'm going there.
Sister, at least eat before you leave.
I'll eat when I come back.
Brother...
I wanted to talk to you, I'll only take two minutes of your time.
Sure, sit down.
Sure.
Is everything alright?
Yes.
How's work?
Work is good, I'm about to get a car as well.
So, what's the matter?
Brother, I wanted you...
to talk to mother, about Ramsha and me... I mean...
I want her to take my proposal there.
Really...
Alright... I'll talk to mother...
And I'll talk to Mahnoor as well.
Sure... thank you.
Did you...
Is Ramsha interested in marrying you?
I don't know... with what face would I have talked to her?
Wouldn't it be better if mother takes my proposal to her?
I think before that you should ask Ramsha about her opinion.
Because for me the most important thing is what Ramsha wants.
You know how traumatized she was.
It was very hard for us to make her return to university.
Ask Ramsha...
and I'll convince mother.
Sure... alright.
Uh... brother...
Thank you so much...
No problem. Bless you.
Ramsha...
Ramsha, I want to talk to you.
Ramsha, I want to ask you something.
Will...
you marry me?
I know...
I know that I should ask my mother to send a proposal your way but...
I wanted to...
ask you.
Why?
Do you feel pity for me?
Everything that has happened in my life, you're the reason behind it.
And now you want to sympathize with me and marry me.
Ramsha, it's not like that.
I don't need...
your pity.
Ramsha, I love you.
And I realized that...
when I lost you...
I admit that I wronged you...
Then I realized that I...
love you like a mad person.
Ramsha, you made a decision as well. You married a man who wasn't worthy of you...
But today, how can this love end?
People...
have no control over their emotions.
What...
Can't you forget...
all this and be with me?
Take him away from here.
Listen to me!
What were you trying to do?
Are you scared?
Whatever happened in your life...
forget everything, you don't need to be scared of anything.
What happened to me...
to sister Mahnoor...
to sister Areeba...
When...
Whenever I think of this...
I feel very afraid. What if this marriage of mine...
Nothing will happen.
There's no need for you to be afraid.
Have you seen how happy sister Areeba is with her child? Sister Mahnoor is happy with brother Faraz.
Have you not seen it?
Ever since brother Faraz came into sister Mahnoor's life...
He has removed all sadness from her life.
I want to do the same with your life as well.
Believe me.
I hope you have a little space in your heart for me.
Is there or not?
If you think of me as your mother, then trust me. I promise you that neither Mahnoor nor anyone else will not meddle in your matters.
You've taken this responsibility to ease my burden, that's why no one will ask you any questions. Mahnoor will apologize to you.
I'm sorry brother Saqlain, forgive me, I made a mistake.
If Mahnoor and Hashir can't get married, then you can keep Areeba with you.
In all these years I wasn't able to see your real face.
Do you think that Mahnoor is that bad.. that you married her to Faraz.
He's a harasser... if you had controlled him from the beginning, he wouldn't have dared to come here with a proposal for you.
I was thinking of making you a partner in my family, but for that, you'll have to do something for me. I want to marry your sister-in-law.
Now I want you to leave Areeba. How long will I share you with her?
I said that I'll leave her
Besides I'm not interested in her...
Give me a child soon, so that I have a solid reason to leave her.
For the past two years, you've been spending nights out of home. Where were you going?
I married for the second time. And that too because you were barren.
I'm not barren, and I'm not without hope as well.
Time passes by, sometimes with happiness... and sometimes without any control...
But if you weren't here, what would be here? Only sadness, not happiness.
People have gone by, some strangers, some not.
They became like ashes...
But you always remained with me... you've become my trust and destiny.
As the sunsets into the Earth...
Now it will give rise to a new era...
And that new era is you.
It seems that this was a long travel.
It was long and hard.
But you were with me, that's why I didn't realize the fatigue of the journey.
I miss you a lot.
I'm at the same office every day, where I have countless memories.
I pray that time flies back and you return as soon as possible.
Your holidays end so quickly. Time flies past...
in a flash.
But still...
I'm sure you don't miss me, as much as I miss you.
I count the days as they pass.
I think about when I'll come back home.
And then we'll be together again.
That's what I wait for as well. I'm very excited.
People say that a woman is behind a man's success.
But I think that I'm the first woman on this Earth...
who has her husband's hand behind her success?
You've always stood by me...
You've removed the hurdles from my path.
The position I'm in today is only because of you.
If you weren't with me, I wouldn't be in this place.
When will you stop doing that?
Love, sadness... responsibilities, everything is shared.
Promise me one thing...
You will stay with me like this like you have up till now.
There will come days when we'll be far away...
Days where love won't be enough...
But I promise you, that we'll always be together.
Together.
