What's the price?
It's worth 150k rupees.
150k ? OK!
Give me 10 minutes please.
Sure! Fine.
Thank you.
Hello Umar!
Yes! Everything is fine. What about you?
That's good! I actually need some loan.
Only 30k!
I actually need it urgently! I'll return it to you by next week.
I cannot come! Can you please transfer it online?
Sure! I'm waiting. Thank you! Goodbye.
Sir! Please sit down.
I'll wait! Thank you.
Received! So now.
Kindly pack this!
Sir please!
Thank you so much!
Take care.
Darling! It's Rimsha's plan. I suggested that we should arrange a dinner but she wanted to celebrate her birthday.
I'm totally fine! Don't worry about me.
I do take medicines on time! It's just that when Mahi was here, she used to give me the medicines.Whatever! When will you come tomorrow?
Sure! Is Saqlain home? Fine. I'll be waiting for you tomorrow..
Mother! What's wrong with Saqlain?
What happened? What did he do?
We are planning a surprise for sister.
Saqlain told me that I should text him the things that I need.
Then what?
I've messaged him the things but he has still not seen my message! I don't know hat to do now.
He'll be busy! I talked to Areeba and she said that Saqlain has still not reached home.
But mother, the time is passing and we haven't done any arrangements yet! We didn't order the birthday cake too. What will we do?
Tell me! What should I do?
Let me call Faraz! He told me that I should call him if there's any help needed.
Are you mad? He is my Son in law.
He'll feel bad that they are arranging a dinner from me by taking my help. That's not good.
What's the big deal? If we can ask Saqlain. Why can't we ask Faraz?
Saqlain is not just my son in law! He handles the whole house already like me son.
Sure! I can see how well he is handling this house.
I think he is ignoring my message on purpose because he knows that I'm planning this surprise for Mahnoor!
We should both go to the market and buy the gifts! We'll order the cake and bring someone to decorate the house too. What do you think?
No darling! I'm feeling dizzy right now. I won't be helpful at all.
Fine! I'll call Faraz. You shouldn't interfere.
Do whatever you like.
Fine!
Hello Rimsha! Have you organized everything?
Faraz! There's a little problem.
Is everything fine?
Yes! Everything is fine but Saqlain is not receiving my calls and you know that I have planned a surprise for sister.
I need to do some shopping and also get the arrangement for decor too. I don't know what to do.
Why are you getting worried? I'm free! I'm coming to pick you. You can do whatever you want to.
I mean that's a great idea! You should come. I'm getting ready!
Sure! I'll see you in a bit. Bye!
Bye!
So Faraz is coming to pick me! He didn't show me any attitude but offered to pick me himself.
That's good!
What were you doing?
Nothing.
I needed some money so I took some.
Can't you ask me for the money? Why would you steal it? Don't you feel ashamed?
I was not stealing it! I would've informed you after taking it.
Just like you told me about your scholarship.
Why do you need it?
You want me to give you the detail about the things I spend money on?
Don't tell me.
This money is for the expenses of this house! I don't have money for you to waste.
Mother! I know that you have the money.
You just got your prize bond.
You have eyes on my bond too? Don't even think about it. I have saved it for my daughters wedding. You won't get anything out of it.
Fine! Almost everything belongs to my siblings.
I have no value in this house! Right?
Yes! You didn't work on it yourself.
You are being unjust with me! You give me some thousand rupees for pocket money.
And I also get scolded before getting it.
What do you think? That I'm dependent on you? I have many more ways to manage.
You don't care about your responsibilities at all.
How will you manage? You are managed by your brother.
You are right!
I hope he didn't take something.
He didn't!
Thank you so much!
Let's go!
Faraz!
Here.
Take this money.
Money? Payment has been done.
There are many things that we need! Come quick.
But mother will mind it.
Why?
Because mother gave this money for these things.
And if she finds out.
Fine! tell me about the person for whom we are doing this all for.
What's her relation with me?
But the party is from our side.
So please take this money from me or she'll get mad at me. She scolds me to much.
No! It doesn't look good for a brother to take money from his younger sister.
You are just like my younger sister. I'll feel happy when I get to know that you actually think of my as your own brother too.
Come quick! We have to buy many other things. Lets go.
It'll look good.
No! Let me ask.
Yes! Did you call me?
It's good that you are here. A friend of Faraz has invited us to his house. Suggest me that will this dress look good?
This is too moderate!
I don't like to wear so fancy dresses. I wear moderate clothes.
But sister in law, you just got married! This is too moderate. Faraz would like you to wear a fancy suit.
Sure! Then I'll chose a heavy dress if Faraz likes it.
I don't know where he is! He came late yesterday too.
I'll call him.
Thank you!
Give me the prescription for aunt's medicines! I'll bring them.
I don't have the prescription! It's with Saqlain. I told him to bring the medicines.
I don't know why would he forget.
No worries! bring me the empty packs of her medicines.
Yes! I'm bringing them.
Faraz! Here's the cake.
It's good that you are here! Did you check the cake? It's the one we ordered, right?
Yes! I checked.
Thats great.
This one? Thank you.
I'll go and bring the medicines for aunt.
Electricity is available too. Complete the decorations by time.
Sure!
I'll go now.
Cake!
You should place it in fridge to keep it fresh.
I'll place it. What's the hurry about?
And Faraz told us to decorate everything timely.
We'll do it. If you are insisting, give it.
Lets go!
Greetings mother.
Yes mother! I'm waiting for him.
I've called him. He might be busy in office. I don't know if he has already left the office.
Yes! I'm getting ready. We'll leave right after he comes home and changes the clothes.
Yes! He knows. I talked with him in the afternoon about it.
No! I don't know if he has left the office by now. We'll leave as soon as he arrives.
Goodbye!
Aren't you ready yet?
I was waiting for you! Where were you?
I had an important thing to do.
What about it?
I'll tell you! We should get suited.
Fine!
Mahnoor!
Yes!
Leave the hair open today!
You look lovely when your hair are not tied.
Sure!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Please come!
If we had to come to my mother's house, why didn't you tell me. You should have told me.
It was a surprise!
Surprise?
Come inside! You'll see everything yourself.
Is everything ready?
Sure!
What is this all about?
Come! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!
How are you?
I'm fine!
So this was your plan?
Well! You can say that it was us.
Happiest birthday to you!
May god bless you with a long life.
Thank you.
So this is why you were busy today.
Yes.
Mother! Where are Areeba and Saqlain? I can't see them!
They are about to arrive.
Will they come?
Why won't they?
I want cut the cake if Areeba doesn't arrive.
It won't!
Mother! I'm telling you that they won't come. If they had to come, they would have already informed us from yesterday.
But nobody contacted us. This clearly means that they have no interest in Mahnoor's birthday.
We already know about how much they like Mahnoor.
Why would they come?
Now get up! Lets go cut the cake.
No Rimsha! Areeba told me herself that Saqlain has told her to be ready.
They'll be arriving soon.
Mother!
Why are you guys here? Everybody is waiting for you outside. Is everything fine?
Darling! We are waiting for Saqlain and Areeba. They'll be reaching soon.
I'm telling you that they won't come.
I should have known it before.
It so good that I called Faraz and he came so quickly!
Faraz is so nice! He took me everywhere himself and paid for everything.
You know it very well if he was not there, this dinner would've not been possible for today.
Sure! Fine! Lets go! Guests are waiting.
What's the wait about?
I mean that its getting late! How long will it take for your daughter and son in law to arrive?
We have to go back to our home too! We cant stay here the whole night.
They might not come.
Sister! Let's do one thing. Lets cut the cake.
We should wait a little bit more. They might come in a bit.
Mahnoor is right! We can wait.
Sure! I'll leave for home. Maheer can drop me. You guys enjoy.
I'm sorry! I've been sick the whole day.
I just came because you invited but I'm feeling ill now.
Fine! I can understand. You won't leave without cutting the cake.
Mahnoor! This is your gift from mother and my side.
This is from my side! Your birthday gift.
Thank you!
Its so beautiful! 
Very pretty and beautiful.
Its very beautiful! God bless you.
So pretty.
Lets cut the cake! Now we should. Please!
Come please! Come.
Areeba?
Greetings!   Greetings!
Looks like they have celebrated the birthday already.
You were saying that Mahnoor won't cut the cake without you.
No Saqlain! We were waiting for you guys.
Mother! I called you and said that we'll surely come.
Darling! It was getting late so thats why.
Who was waiting? Everybody is normal.
You guys didn't think of us! Thats why you didn't wait for us.
Its nothing like that Saqlain! Please don't mind.
If you had picked the call.
I told mother that we'll surely come. We were buying a gift for you.
He stopped at ten places to buy your favorite flowers.
 You! We don't matter to you.
No problem! The cakes been cut.
We don't need to be here anymore.
Happy birthday! You guys should enjoy the party.
Saqlain! Saqlain! Saqlain listen please.
Saqlain wait! Son wait! Where are you going? At least listen to me.
Areeba! A mistake happened. It was a misunderstanding. You know well that I've never cut the cake without you.
Its just that you should forget it and forgive me.
Forgive her please. She is your younger sister.
She'll have a bad mood. Forgive her! Will you gift her a bad mood on her birthday?
Aunt was feeling upset too! She's been sick from the morning.
She is fine now! Her blood pressure was high. She took the medicines. Now she is fine.
If you go back like this, she'll get sick again. She might face the blood pressure problem again too.
Forget it! Lets go inside. We've just cut the cake. We have to party yet.
Sister!
Please don't get mad! I'm feeling hungry. Let all eat together.
Please!
Come! Come! Please come. Quick!
Thank you!
For what?
Whatever you did today! Specially for the arrangements for today.
I did nothing special.
Rimsha told me.
The party and dinner was arranged by you.
No! It was Rimsha's idea and effort.
They we you cared for mother. They way you changed the mood of Areeba and Saqlain.
They have hurt you already but you still.
It's the past Mahnoor! Now the relation has changed.
It easy to make a relation but its hard to maintain the relation.
And this all is my duty.
I just wanted to see you smile!
I didn't expect that from Faraz.
She married the wife of his choice! Now will he act like that?
Maheer was right! That if he marries her, he'll change.
How can you judge Faraz like that? Don't believe Maheer. Faraz does so much for us.
Who else has cared for us except him.
He only cares about his wife. We are a burden to him now.
He has million to gift his wife.
When I asked him about your dowry. He told me that he doesn't have enough. He could've gifted his wife a moderate gift.
He has already spent a lot on the wedding! What was the hurry to go and buy a gift of gold for her?
Mother! You didn't like me gifting Mahnoor something special on her birthday?
Who gives a gift worth millions on a birthday?
When it's not easily possible.
You can do everything for her! Its just us that you won't treat special.
It's not like that mother.
I've always tried to fulfill your demands and I've never left my siblings empty handed.
I've never denied your demands.
I asked you for some cash for her jewelery.
You said that it's too much.
Why would you say that son? You should have told the truth that you have to buy a gift for Mahnoor!
I wouldn't have stopped you.
It's your own money! You can spend them your way.
Why are you saying that? You have forgot our relation?
Mahnoor is also a part of this house and family.
I didn't reject giving the money to you that day.
I asked you for some time! I'll give the money to you.
Don't worry about the arrangements for Aima's wedding. I'm here ! I'll handle everything.
Its my duty! It'll be specially arranged.
Trust me! You all are important for me.
If its you guys or Mahnoor! You all are important.
Brother! Do your breakfast before leaving.
At least do it yourself. You are getting late.
I have time.
Faraz is a nice guy. The things you told about him, I didn't feel like that.
You think that I said it myself? You can ask about him yourself from his neighborhood.
But I don't think like that.
It can be the opposite too.
Mother was appreciating him too! She told me that Faraz helped Rimsha a lot in the arrangements for the party. He paid for everything himself.
Mother wanted him to take the money but he denied himself.
He wanted to show off!
What about the money? Mahnoor has a job. He'll take it back from her.
He gifted Mahnoor an expensive piece of gold on her birthday.
I think he knows Mahnoor.
Do you know that aunt transferred 5 million rupees into Mahnoor's account.
And property worth 25 million rupees! He just gave her a chain. Why is everyone so happy about it?
They can make you fool but not me! I can see everything clearly.
I can see how everyone is liking him.
I was just saying that...
Enough! Don't argue with me.
The tea is cold because of your talks.
I'll get it microwaved.
That'll affect the taste of it.
I'll make a new one for you.
Thats good! Quickly go and make me a fresh cup of tea. I'm getting late for office.
Sure! I'll go make it.
Aunt! Why are you doing it? Let me do it.
No! I'll do it myself.
I'll make the dinner too! I'll cut the vegetables too.
Listen! I don't have a problem with you. You are really nice.
We've been through a lot of disrespect.
We never knew that a girl can break her own home too.
For some stranger!
if it was about divorce! It would be something else.
She blamed us so badly.
That we are not able to sit respectfully in front of anyone.
Leave the past behind aunt. There are many people in this world. Good and bad.
Whoever does bad! They get caught by karma. They can't escape it.
You might be right.
Darling! You are intelligent.
My son Faraz isn't clever! Neither does he have the brain to handle the cleverness.
That's why he gets hurt.
Faraz was burdened by the responsibilities of this house in a young age.
Faraz has seen some bad times. No one ever helped us.
Whatever happened! Faraz did everything on his own. His siblings were too young.
You are right! Faraz is hard working. He does everything so honestly.
Thats why our management of office is happy with him.
He'll soon get a promotion too.
Yes! Surely!
Surely!
My son is really hard working.
Do tell him that he should think before spending. You see how he didn't tell anyone and got you a gold chain worth millions.
I mean that its your right! He should gift you but darling it's too expensive.
He should worry about the house expense and his own pocket too.
Darling! Place these vegetables in the kitchen! I'll cook the dinner myself. You won't!
I'll go pray first.
No need to cook! I'll manage the vegetables myself and cook the food too.
No darling! They are used to eating the food cooked by me.
If they complain about it! You'll feel bad. You can help me.
Sure!
Listen! If you are free. There are some washed clothes of Faraz in my room. Can you iron them?
Please iron my suit too.
I'll do it right after I get done with these vegetables.
The car is still not here! It's getting late.
Hi!
Why are you still sitting here?
I thought that you would've left.
I would've have already left but I'm still waiting for my van. My van hasn't arrived yet.
From Home to University and back to home. Is this really your life?
Its such a boring life. I mean there's nothing else happening in your life.
Don't you get irritated? I mean there's no fun in your life.
Well who told you that I'm not interested in fun or excitement?
By looking at you and judging the way you talk! I know how boring you are.
What have you done in your semester life?
You have just completed your assignments and studied.
What else should I do?
You should not waste your time in copying assignments! I can make them for you too.
I think your van is here!
Go to your home and enjoy your boring life!
Yeah! Yeah! Boring life?!
Bye!
