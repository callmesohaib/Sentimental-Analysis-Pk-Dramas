She cried because of me. I trapped her and deceived her with my love. She's here because of me.
She was also upset because she couldn't get her true love.
Because she was sincere with you but you were flirting with her.
I wanted to go and tell her everything truthfully. I wanted to tell her that whatever I did I was doing to get back at Mahnoor for my insult.
But what could I do? I don't have the strength to bear her hatred.
To tell you the truth, ever since I heard Ramsha married to save you from punishment, I have started to respect her more.
And I feel insulted in my own eyes.
Should I tell you something? Will you listen to me? Don't contact Ramsha now.
He's right and as it is, she's in a lot of pain because of you. The university is still talking about her and she is in pain herself.
What if you destroy her married life?
See whoever that man is. Whether is he older than her or anything, he is her husband.
If he finds out about the two of you. Think about it. He'll make her life hell.
That's why please. Don't contact her again. Try and understand.
He's right.
Did you talk to Ramsha?
No. First I called and nobody answered and now her phone is off, all of a sudden.
Yes. 
I was thinking to go meet her. She is so scared of Touqeer and ever since Areeba told me things, I've been so worried.
Faraz?
Yes mom?
Dear did you say something to Yasir?
No I didn't even talk to him. Why? What happened?
Nothing happened. He just looked a little off and he said that he met you in the office and you insulted him.
I didn't insult him. Yes I told him to work hard and make a name for himself. If he has an issue, I'll talk to him.
No.
Don't inquire and raise matters. Both of you work together, I just don't want anything to happen.
Its about your sister. Mahnoor you two.
Yes. Don't worry. I'll handle.
Yes. You're sensible and you know. You'll handle it.
Yes.
Alright.
This boy has a very cheap mentality.
What happened?
What would happen? If he continues to do what he does, we'll have to take a decision.
Areeba, you haven't eaten anything since morning. Mahnoor told me and even Saqlain said that I should care for your diet.
Don't worry about me.
I will not die so easily.
God forbid why are you talking like this. May God bless you with a long life.
Don't curse me with a long life.
You have no idea what I'm going through, Salman.
I know what Saqlain did but you have to be strong. 
You have to take care of yourself for your child. A mother has a big responsibility for her children.
You will not say no now. I'll finish dusting and bring you lunch.
And I kept Saqlain sir's file here because you said so. Please look at it.
Areeba?
Why are you here? Who do you have here now?
You're here.
I have no relationship with you.
How do you say that? You're my wife.
Because you have decided to divorce me.
And I've seen those papers. If you have decided you want to divorce me. Why haven't you done still?
You're mistaken. Those papers...
I've been mistaken about you since years. I have now seen your real face.
Areeba.. see..
Don't touch me and don't even take my name from your mouth.
Go to her. The one for whom you have decided to leave me for.
Get out from here.
Areeba listen to me.
Saqlain, get out from here. Go away.
Listen...
What are you doing?
Go away.
Have you lost your mind? Whats wrong with you? I'm only holding back because of my child.
Its not your child.
This is my child. Mine. I will never let the shadow of a liar like you, fall on him.
You've lost your mind.
Will you take away my child from me?
Yes.
I will not let you see its face ever in your life. After what you did with me and my family..
you have no relation with me or my child. Go away. Get lost from here. Get lost.
Get lost. This is my mother's house.
Go away..
This is not your house.
Its my house. Its my house.
You're angry. If I don't come for two three days, you'll settle down. I'll not come.
This is my house.
How long will you keep blaming others to hide your sin? Yes I've found it. You took it from the thieves and hid it in the cupboard.
Mahnoor was right about you and I thought she was lying only so that I could save my house.
You killed my mother. She thought of you as her son and yet you did this with her.. 
Areeba..
This is my child. Mine. I will not let the shadow of a liar like you fall on him. I'll not let you see its face for all my life. 
Yes please send him in. I'm waiting.
Come in, please.
Hello. Miss Mahnoor. How are you?
I'm good. Please sit.
I was waiting for you. I've heard you're very punctual.
Yes I did come on time but I met Mr. Touqeer Durrani.
Touqeer?
Do you know him?
Yes he is my brother in law.
Oh really? I didn't know you were Naeema's younger sister.
Naeema?
Who is Naeema?
Touqeer's wife. Naeema Touqeer. Aren't you her younger sister?
No. I'm..
I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about Touqeer Ahmed and that you knew him.
Actually he's a very big businessman and he has a big business. He belongs to Islamabad and he was my neighbor when we lived there.
Thats why we have family terms and we know him. He also has two children.
Anyways, lets get back to work. We'll discuss what we need to.
Yes, the consignment that you sent. Please check the quotation and tell me.
Sure.
Sorry. Alright, no problem. You can check it.
Yes. Sure.
Okay. Thank you. Will you have tea or coffee?
No thanks.
I'll ask my colleague and he'll handle the rest of the details.
Sure.
Nice meeting you.
Yes please give Mr. Amjad all the details about the consignment.
My name is Mahnoor. I'm Ramsha's sister and I want to meet her.
Yes I know.
Sir, mam's sister. Yes, the same. Okay sir.
Madam isn't at home right now.
What do you mean?
She went out with sir a while ago.
I talked to her. She's home. If she wasn't home, who did you call and get the instructions from?
Mam..
Let me go inside. Its very important.
Mam, I'm not allowed you to let you inside. Sir has instructed us not to let any guest inside when he isn't home.
But..
Its important for me to meet her.
Mam I'm an employee. I have to do what my boss instructs me. The house's security is my responsibility so please..
Please leave.
Please listen to me. Let me meet her once. Just once..
Yes Ramsha?
I'll die here of fear. I feel suffocated in this house. Please take me away from here.
Please.
What happened? Is everything alright?
Touqeer has captured me here. He doesn't let me go outside and doesn't let me meet inside. The way he's treating me, I cannot tell you. Please help me.
I was outside just now but the guard didn't let me meet you. Touqeer has instructed him not to let me meet you.
Don't worry. I'll not let you live in this hell. I'll take you away, no matter what. Just take care.
Okay..
Are you going somewhere?
Yes, I have some work. I'll be back.
This means you'll be living here with me. 
Yes.
This is great. I always wanted you to live here with me. But Areeba? Will she live there?
I mean, she fought with you and threw you out. But that house is yours. 
That house is mine and it will stay mine. Let her be there for a while so that her mind settles down.
I can set her straight myself but..
But I feel she'll never straighten out ever now.
And why is that?
Because she is expecting your child now. You'll pamper her and do everything she says and perhaps..
she will only forgive you only if you leave me. And you would do that for your child.
Its impossible. I do want a child but I love you too.
And don't worry about me leaving you. I have to leave her and I would have but..
But you could do it..
I could do that as well. Its not a big deal for me.
And that child?
I'll take it away from her and the house as well. She'll suffer then.
She raised her voice with me. I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget.
And this.. why is that wretched woman calling me again and again?
Who is it? Areeba?
No Mahnoor. Areeba must have told her everything and now she wants to meet me but I don't want to talk to her.
Oh well. Don't worry. Nobody can separate us. I'll come.
Of course I do worry about you. I'll be here for a few days more only. What will you do then?
Then you'll neither have this house nor your money.
How did you like it?
Its very good. Beautiful. By the way,
why is that for?
Just like that. I liked it and bought it for you. If you want you can think of it as a wedding anniversary present.
Areeba? Areeba?
Do you know Touqeer? He is already married. He has a wife and two children. He has his whole family in Islamabad.
Saqlain has deceived us.
What? Mahnoor do you know what you're saying?
I know what I'm saying. Look at these pictures if you don't believe me.
Look at this.
Touqeer deceived us big time. 
Yes.
Where are you? Come home immediately.
Here I am. I knew you'd not be able live a day without me. You get worried.
If Touqeer was already married, why did you get Ramsha married to him?!
He has two children and you got my younger sister married to him.
I don't know about that.
You didn't? How didn't you know? You have been friends with that cheap man for years. You praised him so much and said he'd keep Ramsha very happy.
Is this how he's keeping him happy? He has imprisoned her in his house and doesn't let me meet her.
Why do you both blame me for everything?
Areeba you know I was against you. You forced me to get your sister married to him when you knew what your sister had done.
When did I ever decide anything myself? You planned everything and manipulated me to do your things.
You did everything through me.
All those decisions were yours and I did those.
Areeba, this isn't the time for all this.
Tell him to come with me to Touqeer's house with me to get Ramsha out of his trap. 
Have you lost your mind?
You'll not do anything. I'll do something.
There's no need to talk. I'll not leave Ramsha with that fraud even for a second. I'll not tolerate anything.
Areeba, make her understand.
Mahnoor, take the police along and get Ramsha out.
Have you two lost your mind?
Don't ever think about doing something like this? He's very influential.
We're facing a cheap man like you. We'll face him as well.
But Ramsha will not be left on your mercy.
Alright. Get her divorced and put another stain on her name.
As it is, you don't care for respect or disrespect. She ran away because of you earlier and now you'll destroy her house. Go.
Nothing suits you at all. Its all because of you and you're taunting?
First you dug up a hole for Mahnoor and then you did the same with Ramsha..
Areeba..
Will you talk to me like this only because Mahnoor told you to?
You can leave. I feel nauseated looking at you.
You make me sick. I get sick at myself.
You're testing my patience.
You're testing my patience.
Leave. I might do something with you and myself. Don't ever show me your face in my life again. Please.
Go away.
Areeba you knew I was against this. You forced me to get her married to him when you knew how your sister was.
Hello.
Hello. Where is mom?
Mom went to Yasir's house.
Why did she go to Yasir's house?
I don't know she might have to discuss something about his job.
But he hasn't joined the office yet.
You're tired, should I get you water?
No I'm fine. Thank you.
I understand. Take care. Faraz, come with me.
But where do we have to go? Why are you so worried?
We have to go to Touqeer's house to get Ramsha?
What happened to Ramsha?
Do you know Saqlain lied to us to get Ramsha married to Touqeer and he did a partnership with him in return?
What?
Yes. Touqeer has a wife and two kids and they live in Islamabad. He didn't even tell us about anything.
And how did you find out?
I felt that Touqeer wasn't right for Ramsha there and then. That Saqlain supported him and made everything difficult. We should have stopped them there.
I cannot leave Ramsha there Faraz.
Ramsha shouldn't even live with that man.
But what can I do? He doesn't let me meet Ramsha. Ramsha was worried and I'm getting anxious thinking what he might do to her.
Don't worry. I'll come with you. Lets go.
Come on.
