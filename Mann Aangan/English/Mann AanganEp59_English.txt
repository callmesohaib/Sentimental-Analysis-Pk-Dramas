Open the door Ramsha.
Open the door, otherwise, I'll break it!
Why was this door locked?
What were you doing behind the closed door?
Nothing.
I asked you to come down for dinner.
I'm not hungry.
You're not hungry.
Leave my hand...
What did I do?
Why are you behaving like this to me?
I'll tell you right now.
Let go of my hand.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down!
Don't ever refuse to do anything for me. I'm not used to it.
And whether you're hungry or not, I need you to be here, because I'm not used to eating alone!
Eat!
I'm not coming, I have things to do. I'll tell you if I'm coming. Don't bother me by calling again and again.
Why are you standing here? Go away!
Eat!
Why isn't this accursed man picking up?
What happened?
He's not picking up.
Why are you calling him? He may be busy somewhere.
Where? I asked him to do one thing, and he couldn't even manage to do that.
Lord knows if he'll do it or not. Areeba has let a loose cannon out of nowhere.
I don't believe this. It's possible that she might be turning Saqlain against us.
Come on... she's not like us. And Saqlain trusts her.
Did you not see how he ran off? His color changed when he heard about the baby.
I'm very worried.
You're right... he didn't even meet you before he left.
The entire plan is ruined. I thought that I would have Areeba divorced and have her humiliated.
I would ask him when this house will be sold if he would only just pick it up!
Be patient.... it will be sold.
I can't be any more patient.
Once this house is sold, I'll take his money and run away.
Before Areeba uses the child to remove me from his life, I'll curse him and leave.
Call him again, this time he will pick up.
Lord knows why he isn't picking up.
Fool!
Areeba...
Why are you behaving like a child?
Sorry.
What do you want to tell me?
Is there any excuse that you have left?
Any excuse that you haven't used to make a fool out of me?
Do you know that I don't lie?
I used to think that as well.
Until your real face became apparent to me.
I used to trust your blindly.
What sin have I committed?
I only married again. It's not like I was having an affair.
You must remember that you're the one who used to tell me...
that if I want to have a child, I should marry someone else.
I love you. I didn't share this with you because I didn't want to cause you pain.
You made me out to be a criminal.
I'm sure that Mahnoor provoked you against me.
How long will you blame others for your wrongdoings?
Wrongdoings?
What wrong have I done? I only married...
I've found that necklace.
The necklace you took from the thieves and put in the closet.
They weren't thieves, right?
You are the ones who sent them.
So that they can steal Mahnoor's money from me.
How much did you get paid to get Ramsha married?
What nonsense are you saying?
I heard everything last night.
You were talking to Tauqir.
I have an old friendship with him.
We talk about our business.
And you are the one who was adamant about getting her married to him.
I refused...
Exactly how you were not willing to get Wasay and Mahnoor married...
You realized that Wasay and Mahnoor are suited for each other.
So you send him to Mahnoor.
So that Faraz learns everything...
and once more my sister's life is destroyed.
I...
Mahnoor was right about you.
And I thought she was lying about everything.
To save my home...
I trusted you blindly!
And you...
always betrayed my trust.
I didn't do anything like that.
Mahnoor did all of this. She told you all of this, right?
This is the same sister who alleged me of killing your mother.
It's possible that you killed my mother!
She just didn't think of you as a son...
she treated you like one as well and what did you do?
You make 'son' sound like a bad word!
Areeba!
Even if you raise your hand to me today...
I will not be disappointed.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I know that you're not feeling well.
You won't understand a thing right now... you...
won't understand anything I say...
Yes, we'll talk about this later.
With time you will understand everything...
You just take care of yourself.
Time has told me everything
Hello... greetings... how are you?
I'm fine.
Today's your first day at work, right? I was just about to message you.
Not today...
I'll join from next week...
But the brother said that you would join...
It's not your brother's company, so I won't follow his rules and regulations.
He's an ordinary employee and I work according to myself.
That's why I decided to start on a weekday. I won't get into a routine if I start like this.
That seems fine.
Shall I say something?
What?
That day at work, brother Faraz talked to me quite firmly...
I didn't say anything to him, thinking he was my elder.
Otherwise, if anyone else talks to me like that I...
But Yasir... brother...
He didn't mention anything to his mother.
What would he have said?
Would he have said that he was taunting and that since I was recommended by him, I'll have to be wary of him?
That I'll have to fear him?
But Yasir...
Let me complete myself Aima!
Don't speak in between.
I know full and well the position your brother has at the office.
He's under his wife's thumb. And if used his reference being his close relative...
would he taunt me for it?
I know brother can never do something like this...
Am I lying then?
Does your brother think that if I tolerated him once...
he can say whatever he wants to me?
That will never happen. I have a better position at work than him... and if he tries to mess with me again...
then I will remind him of his worth.
Sister Areeba, please stop crying...
Tell me what happened. Who was that woman with brother Saqlain that day?
Tell us what happened. Who was that girl with brother Saqlain that day?
She...
was her second wife.
What?
Yes...
She was Saqlain's second wife...
He married her in secret.
Only because I was barren
What do you mean by that? How can brother Saqlain do this to you?
I'm not barren
It's okay sister...
You don't believe me, right?
Look at this...
This is my report.
I'm about to become a mother.
Please be quiet and sit here...
Control yourself... it's not good for you to be worried in this state.
I don't understand what I should do.
Brother Saqlain...
I expected him to stoop to any level.
But... never did I expect...
that he would be so cruel to you.
I was afraid of this for years...
I was afraid that he would grow tired of me and marry some other woman for a child.
I listened and agreed to everything he said...
Mother...
you... Ramsha...
I made everyone his servant.
I was manipulated by Saqlain...
and because of his lies...
Whatever injustice I did to you two...
for that I am ashamed...
Very ashamed...
Why are you ashamed? You have no fault in this.
But I never took what you said seriously.
I never believed anything you said.
I thought...
I thought...
that you were irritated by Saqlain.
But you were aware of his real face.
That's true.
But...
I always noticed one thing... the way brother Saqlain seems to be...
he isn't like that at all.
Do you remember that he always used to say...
that he's not the son-in-law, but the son of this house.
And he asked us to even put his shoes into place.
You know how controlling he was.
Not a single leaf used to move into that house without his permission.
He always disgraced me.
And I always hid my eyes...
Maybe in fear...
that I might lose my home.
My childlessness had made me insecure...
But today the slant of a barren woman has been removed from me.
But I...
I was so unfortunate...
I always thought that...
my husband loves me...
that he's the best man on this planet.
I was sincere...
and loving... and this is my punishment for it.
Why are you blaming yourself? You have no blame to take for this.
You only made one mistake... you became afraid of brother Saqlain.
You guys...
Take good care of Ramsha...
On Saqlain's say so...
Lord knows what I did to Ramsha...
You guys need to be in contact with her.
Why are you saying such things?
We all are together. We will always take care of you.
Do you know...
Saqlain was asking Tawqir to be harsh with Ramsha.
And keep her away from us.
Never!
I will never let that happen. I was silent when things were unjust to Ramsha...
and that was the biggest mistake of my life, but now I will not stay silent.
I will not tolerate this.
Nothing bad will happen to her.
Mahnoor...
I think that Saqlain is lying about Mahir...
Do you remember...
the things he said about Faraz, to turn us against him?
If Faraz is so nice...
then...
his brother can't be a bad person.
You are very lucky Mahnoor...
You have Faraz with you.
And Faraz is a good man.
Always stand by my sister like this.
Never leave her alone.
Please...
We will take care of the two of us. Don't worry.
Saqlain sending Wasay back to Mahnoor...
created a rift between you two.
But don't be suspicious of Mahnoor.
Always be like this with her.
Don't let Saqlain be successful in his objective.
My reports!
Don't cry sister... if you cry so much, your eyes will dry out.
What else should I do, if not cry?
At least this way I can ease the burden on my heart...
I feel sympathy for you.
And... I'm surprised as well. You're so young...
What happened that your family was forced to marry you to a man that was older than you?
I had become a problem for them.
Whatever it may be.... they should have thought of it before marrying you.
Even when someone is forced to, it's hard to be married to a man like him.
I've entrapped myself working here. I have to work here because I'm in need.
I'm looking for a good place to work, I'll leave as soon as I find it.
Will you leave this place as well?
Yes... because I'm afraid of his anger.
You know this, look how he treated you yesterday.
Where will I go?
I...
am not even allowed to leave this house.
I can't even meet my sisters.
I'm trapped here.
Please don't leave me.
I'll be alone.
Don't worry... relax and talk to them.
He's not at home... I'll tell you as soon as he comes home.
Hello Mahir...
Ramsha, thank God you picked up!
I've been calling you for ages, but you weren't picking up.
Ramsha...
Are you crying... Is everything fine? Ramsha please tell me...
I'm not fine... nothing is fine.
Nothing is well.
Ramsha what should I do to make this better?
What else can I do for you?
I can't do anything... my life has become a mess.
It's all my fault... your life became hell because of me. If only I hadn't asked you to leave that day with me...
If only that time could return when I could reprimand myself for my mistake.
Miss... he's outside.
I'll talk to you later Mahir...
Tawqir is here...
Ramsha... Ramsha...
He will do something...
What did he say?
He said that he liked the house.
And he's willing to pay our price. He just wants the documents to be in place...
And that he won't buy a place where there's a fuss...
We have the papers.
This house is in my name and the papers are in my name as well.
So... no need to worry about that. Finalize this deal.
That's fine, but Saqlain...
To hell with Saqlain...
He can't do anything and you don't need to worry about it. I'll handle him.
He filed a false report against me.
I didn't do anything, if he finds out I'm involved with something...
then what will he do to me?
It's not like you have to stay here to face Saqlain...
She's right... you're coming with me... you need to fear Saqlain.
Just take the money for this house and leave.
Do you understand?
Okay, I'll try to get things done this week.
Sure son.
Listen, Saqlain can come here any moment.
Take them and leave. Take them...
Sure...
Excuse me.
It's good that this problem is getting fixed as well...
May God bless Ramiz for being useful at the right time.
And he is also being a sacrificial lamb for us.
He is so naive... he doesn't suspect that I can keep the money as well.
He thinks that Saqlain has filed a false case against him.
He shouldn't know. We have a lot for Ramiz to do.
We have to leave this city as soon as possible
Then we'll think about what we need to do with Ramiz. Whether we should keep him or leave.
We'll remove him as well... a new place...
new guy...
I've grown tired of dealing with all the fools!
Really... so they are using me. They want to betray Saqlain by using me...
But this won't happen again.
You can't always make me a fool in the name of love.
Hey, how are you?
She was crying.
And I felt like doing something to myself.
Because I'm the reason for her tears.
Why are you blaming yourself?
Because I've wronged her.
She was crying because of me. I entrapped her in my love and she's in this state because of me.
She was also crying because she couldn't have her true love.
Because she was sincere with you...
but you were flirting with her.
