Did anything happen last night?
You both suddenly left for Mahnoor's house.
I mean that was it a serious problem?
No mother! There was no such problem.
Rimsha wanted to meet Mahnoor!
She should meet in the morning.
It's not important to meet at night!
Situation of this city is not normal these days.
Listen Faraz! Whenever you leave the house, think carefully about it.
You both came so late at night. I couldn't sleep.
Mother! I'll try my best not to disturb you.
You never disturbed me my son! You are so caring towards us all.
Your wife's problems just won't end.
I've always let your mistakes go. This doesn't mean that you should not care about us.
Aunt! What did I do now?
Darling! When will you concentrate on this house. When will you stop worrying about your siblings.
I understand that you were worried because of your mother.
Nobody can ever rest properly after they lose their mother.
Mother! Rimsha is lonely.
How is she lonely? You told me that she is living with her elder sister and brother in law. How is she alone?
Aunt! Rimsha became a little sensitive.
Then get her married.
For how long can you keep her secure?
Faraz! Don't take her when Mahnoor's sister calls her at night.
I won't say that again.
Sure mother!
Mahnoor! Lets go.
Sure!
OK mother! Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Mother! Faraz was lying. He is trying to cover Mahnoor's fault. Rimsha told me that they didn't went because of her.
You should know that they had a fight with elder brother in law.
Fight?
Mahnoor blamed her brother in law that he poisoned her mother.
What?
Who told you?
Rimsha!
They both went to meet her at the university! They can't visit her at her house.
I think that a big fight took place last night.
That's why they both went
Fine!
Just see! He poisoned her.
Mother! She didn't die because of the poison. She had a heart attack. Rimsha told me!
She is doing the same there! She is busy in blaming people.
When you are with me! Time passes like nothing.
If you ask the truth! Its the same for me.
I mean that time passes fast when I'm with you but I do think about my sister appearing.
Come on! Don't worry! You won't get late when I'm around.
You know that I have everything planned.
Sure!
Faraz!
Faraz! You?
Yes! I came here to pick her up but what is going on?
Rimsha! You?
We? We were...
We came here with class fellows! There was a party in our class.
There is no one around except you both.
Everybody just left like a minute ago.
Yes! Like a minute ago.
If you want! I can call them back.
Yes! Actually no.
Rimsha! Mahnoor and Areeba know that you hang around with Maheer after university.
No Faraz.
We planned suddenly. She didn't want to! I forced her.
Maheer! You shouldn't have done it.
Rimsha! You should have informed about this party or get together to Mahnoor.
You know that this would've created a problem if Saqlain saw you both together.
Sorry Faraz!
Anyways! Let me drop you to your home.
Faraz! I can drop her.
No! I think my van would be waiting. I can go by myself.
Call and inform that you are going home.
Come.
Fine!
Faraz!
We'll talk at home.
OK!
Let's go!
Faraz! Please don't tell Mahnoor about this.
Why are you hiding it from Mahnoor?
You know that she will scold me a lot! She'll ask me that why did I leave from university.
Rimsha! Mahnoor is not that conservative. She is your sister. You know her better.
She works and is independent!
I know that she won't have an issue but if you hide such stuff from her than she might get angry.
I won't tell Mahnoor!
But you should inform Mahnoor! Do inform your brother in law too that you are going out with class fellows.
A person doesn't feel scared when he informs about everything.
Yasir! At least try to understand me.
I'm not lying! My mother didn't allow me. Why are you getting mad at me?
Try to understand me!
What happened? Why are you worried?
I'll get mad!
Did you have a fight with Yasir?
Why would I fight him?
He invited me on a lunch! I took permission from mother but she didn't allow me. What my fault.
Do you want to go? I can talk to Faraz if you want to go.
No! Don't talk to him.
Actually I just don't want to meet him.
He is really weird. Do you know how he talks to me?
He wants to know that if I had a boyfriend and who did I like in my family.
Who talks like this?
I feel scared when I talk to him! There's no understanding between us.
Tell me the truth! Did Faraz ever ask you about your past?
Did he ask you about any incidents.
Sorry! I didn't mean it.
You are right!
Faraz and I have never discussed each others past.
But I don't have any such past.
Then tell him! 
I've told him so many times but he won't trust me.
I feel like he is a bit insecure.
He is too insecure and possessive. He is always telling me about himself and how good he is.
You should go and talk to aunt! You don't want to go and aunt is also not allowing.
Aunt will handle it.
You have to handle such relations with patience. Such things can turn bad after sometime.
You understand me right? Go talk to aunt.
Understood.
Oh! Now Rimsha will decide?
The rent and expenses.
Now I really have to answer Rimsha about it?
Areeba!
I never answered aunt!
About everything! All the expense was handled by me.
No! She wasn't asking you about accounting. She was just demanding her pocket money.
How much pocket money does she want? 5k ? 10K ? I'll give her.
Tell her to use money properly! She shouldn't waste it. We have already spent millions on her education.
Your fathers pension will discontinue too. How will we manage the other expenses?
She should stop spending money on silly things.
Sure! I'll inform.
I was thinking of inviting someone here.
Who?
Tauqeer! he is my friend! I told you that I went to pick him. He is a good person.
He was complaining that I didn't invite him over.
Hello! What?
What happened?
I'm coming!
What happened? Is everything good?
Nothing!
I brought a gift!
Here!
Wow!
What is this?
I thought that I should buy you a gift.
I heard that a gift can make us love each other more.
It nice!
But you shouldn't trust such sayings.
Theres nothing bad in giving a gift.
I just wanted to give you a gift and I did! I thought about it. You never demanded a gift too.
Gifts are never demanded! I like it.
Right!
Did you talk to Rimsha?
Yes! I talked to her. She preparing for her semester finals.
Yes! Did she tell anything else?
No! Nothing else.
Did you talk to her about anything?
No! I didn't. I was just asking you about her health and is she alright?
Everything is good. You've handled everything.
I would've made things bad.
Your exams are near too! How is your preparation?
Exams! What are you talking about?
Do you really think that I can give exams in such situation.
You'll have to give your exams! Don't care about the result. It's must for you to give your exams.
I'm sure that you'll pass!
Saqlain is coming!
What happened! What is this about?
How should I tell you.
Will you answer?
Just know that we were unlucky!
If I didn't say it to her. It wouldn't have been serious.
The kid could've been saved!
What have I done?
What did you do with my son!
Saqlain! What are you doing?
She did nothing!
How did it happen?
It is a bad incident.
I gave him money to order.
He took all the money!
Were you mad!
There was no need to give him the money.
Its my mistake!
I didn't know that he'll scam!
When she got to know it! She suddenly got sick. I went to hospital with her.
We were late.
Please forgive me Saqlain! You lost something precious because of me.
You were worried about the money?
I'm worried about my kid.
Its a big loss.
Its a shock for me.
I couldn't handle!
My life's dream was about to be fulfilled.
Maheer!
Yes brother?
You won't take Rimsha with yourself ever again!
But why? We class fellows go out for lunch together! What's bad in it?
Rimsha isn't just your class fellow! She is Mahnoor's sister.
Then what?
I don't want anyone to blame Rimsha because of you!
You know what I'm talking about!
Be careful!
Fine!
She isn't picking up my call.
Mahnoor! Who are you calling?
I'm calling Rimsha! I'll ask her that why did she leave the university without informing me.
So that she thinks that I told you!
No! Why would you tell me.
You ignored it because Maheer is your brother. You knew that they were both together.
You really think that i didn't talk to you because of Maheer?
I feel sorry for you!
And I feel sorry for you! I never thought that you'll ignore Rimsha and Maheer together. It's nothing for you?
I didn't tell you because I thought that Rimsha will share it with you.
I warned Maheer too that he won't take Rimsha anywhere!
Unless you allow him !
I can never allow him to date my sister.
You really hate Maheer that much?
It's not about hate Faraz! You know the activities of Maheer.
But he is still my younger brother.
Rimsha is my younger sister! It's not wrong for me to care about my sister.
I mean that I take tension because of her! Your mother didn't allow your sister to go on a lunch with Yasir!
This is something else!
No! It's about care.
You know Maheer better than me. He was never serious for anything. You know better.
You should think it yourself! If he leaves the university with Rimsha, and something bad takes place? Think!
I have requested Maheer many times.
But he didn't listen. Today I'll make him stop.
Mahnoor!
Mahnoor! Listen to me.
What?
I have told Maheer many times to stay away from Rimsha! I've to talk to him. He doesn't understand.
Maheer! I've told you to stay away from Rimsha! Why won't you leave her alone?
I also told you to stop her yourself!
Rimsha isn't a kid!
Behave yourself Maheer!
You should notice how she is talking to me!
You should stop brainwashing Rimsha! Don't take Rimsha anywhere with yourself.
Take my Advice! Why don't you get Rimsha a neck collar and tie her in university.
Maheer! Rimsha goes to her university so she can study!
You are trying to spoil her! You won't lose anything but she might.
Now she had to blame him for this?
Maheer! What is she saying?
What's your relation with her sister?
There's no relation! She is just my friend and class fellow. Just like others. Let me tell you something.
She wanted to be friends with me. I didn't ask her. She is just blaming me.
I'm also trying to help her! I promise.
Maheer!
Wait Mahnoor!
Maheer! It's fine till studies. You won't take Rimsha with yourself anywhere else!
I didn't go alone with Rimsha!
All the class fellows were with us! It was a party in our class. Why is she blaming me?
You take her out!
Darling! Blame your sister before you blame him!
Try to handle her! If you are really concerned than warn her.
I'll stop her.
Yes! Stop her.
She cannot stop her fight! And you! I'm warning you to not talk to her sister in the university!
Do you really need friends! She should keep her sister. You don't need her.
I'm suffering in this house because of her.
Go inside!
Fine!
What did you get from this fight?
Faraz!
Mahnoor! You have no patience. I told you that I had warned Maheer and I talked to Rimsha about it too.
You taunted me about my sister! You insulted Maheer. It was a proper fight. Mother is mad at you again!
I'm sorry but I had warned Maheer many times and same goes for Rimsha!
She also promised me that she won't!
But still... I'm hut concerned about my little sister Faraz!
So you mean that I'm not concerned about her respect?
I started to drop Rimsha myself! But you!
You only trust yourself! Thats fine.
You can fight the world! You'll feel embarrassed afterwards.
Where is he?
Its good that Faraz saw us! Sister would've scolded me.
She already knows it! She scolded me a lot.
What? She won't ignore.
Really? You look scared. You said that you'll support me in every situation.
No! I'm not scared.
I felt embarrassed in front of Faraz! Mahnoor might even kill me!
You are my class fellow and friend! My brother didn't scold me! Your sister insulted me!
Faraz told me that I won't go anywhere with you.
Fine! Then don't. I don't care.
Don't be mad!
I'll get mad at such things.
Fine! I'm sorry.
You know that I can't leave you mad.
I can also not stay mad at you!
True?
Who are you talking to?
Leave the phone.
Hello!
Declined? Who were you talking to?
Speak!
I don't know! I was just..
What are you doing? You broke the phone.
I don't know! I was just talking to my universities friend.
I don't know why she declined?
Why did she decline after she heard me?
You broke the phone so I cannot track.
I promise! I was just talking to a friend.
You think I'm stupid? Do I look stupid?
I warned you not to talk on your phone late night!
I'll tell this to Saqlain!
I promise that I was talking to a friend.
Don't lie!
Where are you going?
I'm going home! Where else?
You could've stayed here! My health is upset to.
Areeba is calling.
Why is she calling?
I don't know!
I'm suffering!
Saqlain! Why are you so embarrassed.
Why shouldn't I?
I dreamed a lot.
I thought about her name.
I wanted to name her a beautiful name.
Sure! Go! You won't care about me.
I'll be good on my own.
Go!
I care about you! But this also happened because of you.
Because of me? You think that?
I did this on purpose? Saqlain! No mother can do this to her children.
You should have let him go! Why were you stopping him?
You should have created a little drama too.
He felt bad.
He was crying but I cried because of him.
I didn't think that he would feel so hurt.
I thought that this person is stone hearted. But he showed his weak side.
You have to know that he loves you!
And do you know! I hate him so much because he embarrassed me a lot.
I feel so good when I hurt him.
He feels insulted.
What happened? Is everything fine! You look weird.
I'm worried.
Why?
Why worried?
We lost something big.
Why would someone hurt you so much?
Loss of 5 million.
Its a big amount! How did it happen?
Someone looted the locker in my factory!
It's a big shock!
Everything is destroyed! Nothing is left.
