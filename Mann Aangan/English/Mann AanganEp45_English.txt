Mom, I want some money.
Didn't I tell you I don't have money?
Mom I just want a little money nothing more. What is wrong with you?
Maheer?
Yes brother?
What do you think of yourself?
What is wrong with you?
Didn't I warn you? Why don't you understand what I say?
Will someone tell me what he did?
I have always ignored your mistakes thinking you're at a age where people make stupid mistakes.
But you have crossed all limits.
Leave him. Leave him! Talk to me.
Whats wrong? Why did you hit him?
He has been planning to elope with Ramsha.
No mom. Its not that.
Really? Its not that?
Then is Saqlain lying?
No. But..
He told Ramsha to run away with him and that he would marry her.
It was actually..
You're not even independent and you want to elope with a girl?!
Mom..
Be quiet. Now I'll hit you myself. Didn't I warn you that day?
I asked you stay away from Mahnoor's sister. Why did you meet her then?
He has had Ramsha disrespected. They have now barred her from going to the university.
It is good. As if she went to the university to study. She had been trapping my son.
Aunty please..
I will not hear a thing about Ramsha. Maheer trapped Ramsha. I tried my best to stop Maheer but he didn't listen to me.
And now he's suggesting her that they should run away and get married.
Really? Am I after her?
Mom she isn't a child. She loves me.
I asked you to shut up. I'll break your face.
I think he's misusing the freedom we've given him.
Faraz!!
Please stop right now. Please. I'll explain him. He'll never look at Ramsha again.
This is best for him.
You know I was insulted so much because of him. The words Saqlain used for him.
He is after you always. He just needs a chance to argue with you.
Yes but he didn't say anything wrong.
He was right about him. He's cheap. Nobody from a decent family thinks this was about any girl. They don't think about running away.
Why don't you listen? I warned you that day.
You should drown to your death.
What is your problem? Why are you after me?
Because your habits are such.
Look at me. Were you trying to fool me when Mahnoor said so. You said she was your friend.
Where did marriage come from? And will you get married? Can you afford that?
You haven't finished your education and thinking about a job kills you.
Mom please stop it.
I should stop but you wouldn't. You have sworn to get me insulted in front of Mahnoor and Faraz. 
And my poor son had to listen to that wretched Saqlain.
God forbid, had their arguments increased. Listen to me with open ears. Throw this stupid idea out of your mind.
Keep your love and passion intact and focus on your studies. I'm thinking about your sister's marriage and here you are with your spectacles.
You have no realization of responsibilities and yet you want to elope and get married.
Mahnoor, I want to apologize to you.
Faraz, why are you apologizing?
Because whatever is happening,
My younger brother is the reason of that.
But you're not the one at fault here.
You..
Of course.
If Maheer is being stupid and your sister is infatuated, where is Faraz at fault here?
Why is Saqlain taunting him?
Mom, please let it be.
How should I let it be? He needs a reason to argue with you.
He always insults you without thinking.
He didn't insult me only. I had to hear so much because of Maheer's stupidity.
And Areeba and Saqlain also taunted Mahnoor.
And now what did Mahnoor do to them? She is in fact after Maheer's life.
She hides everything her sister does and holds Maheer accountable. God forbid. I don't know how her family is.
Mom, now keep this on yourself and think about it.
We also have a daughter and sister in our house.
Don't compare her sister to my daughter.
Ramsha is just like a sister to me. Just like Aima.
And how can Maheer think about running away with Ramsha?
No. He will not do that.
He might be acting as a hero. I'm made him understand. Please now you also end it.
Finish this off. Give him some cold water so that his anger subsides.
Hello Maheer, this is Ramsha?
Ramsha, what is this new mess?
You have no idea. Everything has gone haywire. My sister has forbidden me to go to the university.
I know. Your brother in law made a mountain out of a molehill.
What do you mean? Did Faraz say something to you?
Say? I had a fight with him.
Your sister accused me in front of my mom and brother. You cannot even think about it.
My sister?
Yes. Faraz and mom, both of them hit me for the first time in my life.
And all this, I tolerated because of you.
Then? What should I do? You tell me. I don't know what to do.
I'll think about something and tell you. Right now I'm upset myself.
Please take care of yourself and keep your phone with you. Don't let your family take your phone away. I won't be able to contact you then.
Don't worry. I'll keep my phone safe somewhere. My sister won't even find it.
Bye.
Alright. Bye.
Where is your phone?
I don't have it.
Give it to me. Where have you kept it? Bring it out.
Don't you remember my screen cracked? I gave it for repair when Saqlain gave me the money.
Had mom been alive, she would have gotten a heart attack because of you. You've made my life, a living hell.
What happened? Did she give you the phone?
She said she gave it for repairing. Her screen had cracked.
But that.. Alright. Its good she doesn't have a phone.
Its good that she won't be able to talk to Maheer.
Hmm. I'm thinking that,
we should get her married.
We will. But we need time to find a proposal. Its not easy to find one.
I'll ask aunt Yasmeen. Mom asked her for Mahnoor as well.
Tell me one thing. How many proposals she brought for Mahnoor? As far as I remember she would take money every week and couldn't find a decent proposal.
You know what Mahnoor's issue was.
Your sister isn't a pious character as well. The entire neighborhood knows about her.
Remember the letter. First she had a boy stalking her. Then someone jumped intruded the house and broke the glass.
And there is a different scene in the university.
Both your sisters have created hell.
I am ashamed. I want to drown myself.
Why are you saying like this?
How else should I say it? Think about it. What will we do if Ramsha runs away with Maheer? Think.
We will have no option other than suicide. The world will not let us live because we took Ramsha's responsibility. Think.
Who are you calling?
Areeba. I don't know where Ramsha is.
I don't know what is going on. How is everyone there? Even Saqlain..
You have an exam in the morning. You can ask about Ramsha tomorrow.
But Faraz.
Mahnoor you're giving your exam tomorrow and its decided. Please try and sleep.
Aunty, I have my exam today. I've worked very hard.
I've waited as well. I'm a little nervous.
Please pray for me.
May God give you success.
Mom, I'll just drop Mahnoor and come.
Dear, breakfast?
I'll come and have it.
Why are you taking her hungry? How will she attempt her paper hungry?
I'll eat something there.
Please take your bag. I'll wait outside.
You're worried about your daughter in law and that too after so much arguments?
I thought your mood will be spoiled because of her because Faraz slapped Mahir because of Mahnoor.
Faraz hit Maheer because of what he did. Had he done this before, things wouldn't have reached this point.
Didn't I tell you to control Maheer?
Is it all my fault? How can I control him?
I cannot slit his throat. He's my son and that too my dear son.
This son of mine has left me embarrassed in front of my daughter in law.
Shut the door slowly. Your father isn't alive to get us a new one. He's venting out on the door.
He doesn't bother getting something himself but he will break everything. Go,
and ask him for food. He just came home and I was worried for him all night.
Salma, ask Ramsha to come for breakfast.
Alright.
Wait.
Areeba let me have my breakfast and then call her. I don't want to see her face.
Please Saqlain. Don't be so angry on Ramsha.
Why do you sympathize with her all of a sudden? Now you're advocating for her. Tell me what to do next.
She will definitely need to go to the university. She'll meet Maheer there and then run away the first chance they get and get married.
No. I don't want this. I'm asking you that,
please don't be so angry on Ramsha. All of us scolded her yesterday. I was very angry with her.
She is my younger sister. And youngsters make mistakes. Elders should forgive them.
Alright. Go and call her for breakfast.
Alright.
What can we do she is your younger sister? She's like a sister to me but its different that she has always disrespected me.
Tea?
I don't need it. I'm done with my breakfast.
My mother, everybody.. This woman has turned everybody in her support.
Maheer?
What is it?
Will you have breakfast?
I don't want breakfast. Get lost from my room right now.
Ill mannered man. I've come to ask you for breakfast even after so much happened,
and you're showing me attitude.
Don't you understand? I asked you to leave. Leave.
Go to hell. Die hungry.
I'll get her straight.
Ramsha, Saqlain and Areeba are calling you.
Why?
For breakfast.
I don't want any breakfast. If you can, get me poison.
I'll eat that.
Salma?
Yes?
Please go and give Saqlain another cup of tea. The one he has is cold.
Alright.
Go.
Will you not stop being stubborn? Aren't you ashamed of showing so much attitude even when you're at fault?
I am trying to beg Saqlain to not be upset with my sister and your attitude is never ending.
How dare I show you attitude? I am myself trapped here.
I'm imprisoned in my own house. And you two? You both have taken over my house.
You are not ashamed of saying this, are you?
We are forced to be here because of you. Do you remember?
That night you cried and called us here when your ex lover came in this house.
My ex lover?
Who else was it? Who came in the house and didn't rob us of anything?
Those guys used to follow you as well. You had them stalking your van.
And the letter that came. What about that?
You and Mahnoor had created a big mess.
Had Saqlain and I not come to live here, I would never know that path you were walking on.
You're accusing me without any reason. I..
Enough. You don't have to give any clarifications.
Its best that you stay home. Understand?
Saqlain and I don't want to live here. If we're here, we're here because of you. We're helpless.
I'm not an animal that you have captured in this house.
Yes? I'm done with my exam. It was very good. Really.
No. I didn't call you to pick me up. I have booked a cab. You work peacefully.
Listen, I'm going to meet Areeba. Is there any problem? I'll come.
Bye.
Mahnoor?
Wasey? You?
Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine. 
But I don't think you're fine. I feel you're very stressed and..
even depressed.
You're absolutely wrong. Its nothing.
My intuition?
Can never be wrong about you Mahnoor.
I can look at your exams and tell..
I had my first exam for CSS today. You understand the pressure and stress of the exams?
I was up all night. Maybe that's why.
Oh good. So finally, you're appearing for your exam.
Yes.
Best of luck.
Thank you.
Mahnoor? How will you go?
I've booked a cab. It'll be here any moment.
Cancel the cab. I'll drop you.
No you don't have to. I can go. Thank you.
Mahnoor. At least give me some time. We met after months.
I want to talk to you.
Wasey see..
I've changed my decision Mahnoor and I respect your decision. I..
Can I not get even 10 20 minutes in spare?
Have you forgotten that we parted way a long time ago?
There's no need for all this. You can leave.
How much time? I've been waiting. What do you mean there's a traffic jam?
Should I book another cab? Alright I'll cancel this ride and book another one.
What happened?
I think there's a traffic jam thats why the cab is late.
But its my fault. I should have brought my car. I'll not even find a rikshaw here.
But I'll manage.
I'll drop you.
No. There's no need. I can manage.
Please Mahnoor. How long will you wait for a taxi here? If there is a traffic jam,
the other driver will be late as well. Come with me. I'll drop you.
Wasey no.
I have a meeting but I cannot leave you alone here.
No but..
Please. Let me give you a ride. Come on.
Come. Please. Thank you.
How is Hashir?
Hashir? 
Your husband's name is Hashir, right?
I remember even today. I sent you an email last time.
But you didn't it was important to answer that.
Yes because you said I should contact you if I was in need.
This means you never needed me. Oh well. Let it be.
Tell me, how is Hashir? What does he do? How are you?
Are you doing something or are you a housewife?
My husband's name is Faraz.
Hashir divorced me two days before we got married. I'm working as a commercial manager in a construction company.
Faraz is my colleague.
But enough about me? Tell me when did you come back from the US and are you married?
I came back this month after completing my studies. I haven't gotten married yet.
Why?
Because I had been waiting for you.
My house.
Oh I'm sorry. I forgot.
Thank you. Bye.
Mahnoor..
Yes?
Will you meet again?
No.
Who is it who dropped Mahnoor?
Oh. Its Wasey.
How did he come here? Mahnoor with Wasey?
How is Ramsha?
How will she be?
Ask us, how we are?
Enough, Areeba.
Stop being hyper about everything.
You have stopped Ramsha at home. Aunty scolded Maheer a lot. Forget everything now.
Yes you can say that.
The reason is that because nothing bothers you about this.
Saqlain I accept that Ramsha made a mistake. You should have stayed in a limit with Maheer in the university.
How could she stay in limit? You encouraged her.
I've never encouraged her. I always make her understand.
And now you're blaming me..
Alright then.
If you couldn't control her, you could have told me. I have now controlled everything doing something or the other.
I think rather than saying all this, we should find a good proposal for Ramsha.
We should get her married. She is young and insensible. She can make mistakes but we're elder than her.
We have to think about her.
Yes.
Right now, this is the only situation.
I do have a proposal but..
No..
He is a little older than her.
No. We will not get Ramsha married just for the sake of it.
We will look for a good proposal. The guy should be well mannered and well educated.
Yes. We should find a good proposal.
Yes of course. Why not? He should be splendid.
Better than Faraz and Maheer.
Educated, well off, well settled.
He should be well mannered. He should be a successful man.
You had a friend, what was his name? Wasey...
We should find such a guy for Ramsha. Isn't it?
How come you thought of Wasey right now?
I just thought about him.
He belonged to a well off family.
What was the use of being so well off when you couldn't be loyal?
Didn't you see, how before getting married.. Mahnoor..
Yes I remember.
There was just something amiss.
Right, Mahnoor?
Leave from here. I don't want to talk to you.
Rather than being ashamed you're being angry with me?
What did I do wrong?
How much did I try to make you understand but you didn't listen to me?
I love Maheer.
For God's sake. Stop it. He isn't worth you. How will you understand that?
Faraz is suitable for you but Maheer isn't worthy of me. What is it? What do you want? Why are you doing this to me?
You know your problem? You're idealizing Faraz and looking at Maheer but they're different. Maheer isn't like Faraz.
No. I am idealizing Maheer. He is my ideal.
Even then Maheer and Faraz have no comparison.
There is still time. Understand. Nothing will go wrong for Maheer but you'll create more problems for yourself.
Haven't you left your education and aren't you sitting at home?
Had you listened to me, this wouldn't have happened. For God's sake Ramsha. Listen to me and don't do all this.
What do you want me to understand? I'm imprisoned here and my university is off limits.
What should I do? Die?
Don't say like this.
Both of you are my enemies. Ever since mom died you're treating me so wrong.
Who is treating you wrong? Tell me.
Areeba, let it be.
What should I let be? Tell me.
She's being melodramatic and ill mannered. Had mom been alive she would have given you a good beating.
You have no shame left. Your elder brother in law is outside and hearing everything you say.
I'm so unlucky. I have to be guilty like a criminal in front of my husband.
Did I have less problems in my life that it was important for you to do all this?
Please relax. Don't cry like this.
You know my pain, don't you.
I do..
I keep burning in this fire. I pine whenever I look at my empty lap.
And now her dramas..
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
Control her.
