Saqlain, what did you do about my work?
Don't worry, it will be taken care of...
I know it's getting delayed, but there's nothing to worry about.
I hope it isn't too late.
What are you saying?
As long as I'm here nothing will be late. Don't worry and trust me.
I'm thinking...
of buying a house here.
Here in Karachi?
Are you thinking of shifting to Karachi?
Yes, I will have to spend time here. I will have to keep Ramsha in a proper home after the wedding.
Give me some advice. Where should I look for a house?
I have a lot of locations. It depends on what you like.
And I know what you like. This will be done as well.
Good relationships are hard to find. Especially for a girl who has already tried to run away from home.
You look stressed and depressed to me.
You're completely wrong. It's nothing like that.
I can never be wrong about you.
I still haven't married anyone, because, to this day, I've still been waiting for you.
What is the matter?
Nothing...
Did your paper go well?
Yes.
You went home, was everything alright? Was there an argument?
No... everything will get better once Ramsha is married.
You're saying that?
Why?
Can't I say that?
This is what's better for Ramsha... sister Areeba is very worried for her.
How long will sister Areeba and brother Saqlain look after her? I think this is what's best for Ramsha.
At least this way she won't have to listen to anyone.
That is completely different.
But you're the one who says that marriage is not the solution for everything.
Maheer...
is my younger brother. But still, I don't think he's suitable for Ramsha.
Otherwise, I would have talked to my mother about it. Anyways, forget it.
What is the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?
You're very nice.
There's none like you.
Thank God that you learned that on time.
Did you make this coffee, or did you have Aima make it?
I made it myself.
How do you like it? A single sip has washed all my fatigue.
Thank you.
It's because it's a coffee made less with coffee and more with love.
Do you know with whom Mahnoor came home today?
Yes, I'm sure it was with Faraz.
No... she came here with Wasay.
When I was standing on the balcony, I saw Wasay dropping her off at our doorstep.
Wasay dropped Mahnoor? Where and when did she meet him?
That I don't know. But I want to know why he met her.
Did Wasay run into Mahnoor... or did Mahnoor...
went to meet him?
What are you saying? How can Mahnoor do this?
I don't know what to think. Lord knows what Mahnoor wants to do now.
Mahnoor is married now... she is happy in her home. Faraz is a good man...
and he takes good care of Mahnoor as well.
There is a big difference between care and love.
Forget it.
No, I will ask Mahnoor about this.
Don't you dare talk to her about this?
You will not say anything to her. If she shares something with you then you can talk to her about it, but not before that.
Who is this? Who threw this?
Let me teach you...
Saqlain...
What is this?
There is something written on this.
What is it?
Pack your stuff and jewelry by tomorrow night. Both of us will run away and marry each other.
Mahir...
Ramsha...
Listen...
Listen to me...
Ramsha!
If you step a foot out of this house, I'll...
Don't say anything to her...
Why shouldn't I? Otherwise she'll run away.
She doesn't even know...
Did you not read the letter... what is written in this letter?
The letter says to pack your clothes and jewelry and that you two will marry each other in court.
Saqlain...
What? If he comes here I'll end him. My name is Saqlain!
What are you saying? I don't understand.
Your lover is coming... it's written here in this letter.
It's nothing like that...
It shouldn't be! Otherwise, I'll kill you and him!
Come with me... I'll lock her in the room.
Do whatever you want, but I don't want her leaving anywhere!
I'll lock the door from outside.
Ramsha, what are you saying? I threw a letter?
Yes... brother Saqlain just showed it to me.
He thinks that I'm planning to run away. He's locked my bedroom door as well.
Brother Saqlain was so angry that he said that he would kill me.
Isn't he overreacting?
He can't touch me, I challenge him. I will make you run away with me, marry you in court and your family won't be able to do anything.
Mahir...
Ramsha, what do you want?
I just want you.
That's the only thing you can do locked in your room.
What should I do? They will force me to marry someone.
Are you cattle?
You're a human, you have your choices and your life.
What should I do? I requested sister, but she was not willing to listen.
If it were up to sister Areeba she would marry me tomorrow, because she just wants to get rid of me.
Alright, leave them then.
Look... if you want to spend your life like you want it, then you need to be a little brave.
What do you mean? I'm coming to you.
To pick you up.
She's left home, she's outside.
Be careful. I want to know where they go.
Areeba...
Areeba... get up! Are you on your drugs?
Do you want anything?
Ramsha's not here! She's ran away!
What?
Her room's unlocked. She's not at home. She's ran away with that man!
No... you have it wrong. Ramsha cannot do this...
I locked her myself. Then how can she run away?
How do I know? I was locking up and the outside gate is open.
Ramsha's door is unlocked as well. If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
Take a look.
She took the jewelry that was there.
It's possible that she had a duplicate key.
I could never imagine she could go this far, otherwise, I would have asked you to tie her up, before locking her.
Where can she go?
God... what test is this?
What test is this?
Who are you calling right now?
Mahnoor... I'll tell her that her brother-in-law ran away with Ramsha.
No need to tell her anything. Let's go there to talk to her.
Where were you? Hurry up!
Tell me, where will we go at this hour?
Where else than Hansa's place?
Your friend Hansa?
She's my best friend and I know that I'm safe there.
The most important thing is that we'll adjust there easily. Don't argue and come with me.
Don't worry at all. I'm with you. Now that you're here...
please I'm requesting you. Come with me.
Sit down.
What are you guys doing here at this hour? Is everything alright?
Where's your brother Mahir?
Sister Areeba... brother Saqlain what happened? Why are you asking this?
Because his brother has ran away with Ramsha.
What? If you don't believe me... read this.
It's written here that the two of them have run away. He made Ramsha steal jewelry as well.
Why are you alleging Mahir falsely? He's in his room and his bike...
Where is his motorcycle?
Faraz... I saw Mahir taking his bike out, but I never imagined it.
I had no idea that your brother will try to compromise the respect of my home.
Your brother has provoked my sister to run away.
All of them are in on it Areeba.
I'll file a case against Mahir with the police. I'll tell them that he has kidnapped Ramsha.
What's the matter with your Saqlain?
You can't punish Faraz for what Mahir did. Faraz, call Mahir and ask him where he is.
Sure, I'll call him.
Sister Areeba come inside, let's talk inside.
How can I come inside?
I'm scared... God forbid, what if something bad happens?
It won't!
Don't even think like that. We'll find them.
He's not picking up.
May God question him. How could he test me at my age?
Once I find your son I will kill him!
Lower your voice...
It's the middle of the night... and your voice is echoing in the neighborhood.
Let them hear what your children have done.
Let them hear how well you raised them. One son beats up his wife and ousts her from the house and the other one...
provokes a girl, from an honorable family to run away with him.
For God's sake, brother Saqlain be quiet!
What do you want to prove by insulting auntie and humiliating Faraz? They are not at fault.
Mahir is the one who made the mistake and he is the one who should be punished.
What do you want to prove by screaming so loudly? Do you want to defame Ramsha?
Ramsha will be defamed!
If she doesn't come home tonight...
then we won't be able to show our faces to anyone.
I'll go to Mahir's friends' house... maybe he's with one of them.
I'll come with you as well.
We'll come as well, maybe we'll find her there.
Come on, we'll try this as well.
Alright, you guys won't have any problem here.
You guys can stay here as long as you want.
And... what about your mom and dad?
Mom and dad are both in the UK. I and my servants are the only ones that are home.
But yes, none of them know who the two of you are and why you're here, alright?
Thank you so much.
Anytime Mahir... I was thinking that you...
Forget about it. It's getting late...
You two should sleep.
Good night*
Listen...
How long will we stay here?
We will...
stay here for a few days. I'll tell all my friends tomorrow and then we'll marry each other in court in a few days.
Then no one will be able to separate us.
We'll be one, forever.
Alright.
And yes... you will sleep upstairs.
The room on the first left of the stairs is yours.
And I'll sleep here, somewhere.
Yes, but when I wake up, please call me, I'll come to you immediately.
Bag...
Sure...
Good night*
Am I making a mistake? Have I made a mistake by running off with Mahir?
I wonder if sister Areeba and brother Saqlain know if I'm gone or not.
No... they must be sleeping by now.
What happened?
He has turned off his phone.
Oh God... where should I hide myself.
Her brother-in-law is threatening us with the police. What if he complains to the police?
Why is he testing me? Call him again.
Keep calling him. Maybe it's the problems with the network.
No, brother Faraz. Mahir didn't come here.
Khurram don't lie to me right now. I'm worried sick.
I'm not lying, you can check inside. If you don't believe me, you can confirm with my parents. He's not here.
When did you last talk to him?
I didn't talk to him today. I called him but he didn't pick up.
He didn't reply to any messages as well.
Ask the rest of his friends, but don't tell them that I'm asking.
Alright, I'll call them.
Saqib, what are you doing? Sorry for disturbing you, tell me, did you talk to Mahir today?
He's not picking up. Alright, thank you, farewell.
There is only one solution for this now Faraz. I'm going to the police station to file a complaint against your brother.
Brother Saqlain... listen to me... don't involve the police. I'll find Mahir and Ramsha.
Farewell brother Faraz.
Faraz... did you find out anything about Mahir? Did you find him?
No...
I don't know what was he thinking when he did this.
God forbid, if this reaches Aima's in-laws...
Faraz... do something... find out where he is.
What if we're late? What if he marries Ramsha?
Where should I look for him? I've searched the entire city. I've talked to all of his friends. He hasn't contacted any one of them.
Mother.... what if they left the city?
God... God... was this the only thing that was left remaining.
Weren't we humiliated enough? Did you see how much Saqlain was screaming?
Our neighbors heard it as well. The news will spread to everyone
Mother, what's with you? What are you saying?
You're worried about the neighbors. I'm worried about Ramsha, she's a girl.
And... what will the neighbors say?
They will taunt Mahir as they did me. What difference does it make?
Just once, think about Mahnoor's sister.
She will be defamed by all this. She will have to face so much embarrassment.
I'm disappointed in my brother. I always thought he was brash and emotional. But he turned out to be a vile man!
Not once did he think about the girl and her respect.
And Saqlain has gone to the police station to file a complaint.
Stop him!
Stop him...
I can't stop him.
Mahnoor my dear, make him understand, he will listen to you.
God... only You can do some sort of miracle.
Go away. What is the matter?
My name is Saqlain and I'm here to report that my sister is missing.
What's her age?
Twenty-three years old.
Meaning she's an adolescent.
Yes.
When was she kidnapped? Do you have any suspicions?
She's been missing since last night.
It could be that she left on her own. Did she fight with someone at home?
It's nothing like that, but there is a guy who has provoked her.
He has ran away with her... and there is jewelry worth fifty lacs missing as well.
Please... file a kidnapping against him.
That's strange. The girl is an adolescent. She ran away from home with the jewelry because of a guy.
We cannot file a kidnapping case against the man. The girl ran away.
Look, that man is a thug.
If he investigate about it in his area, you'll find out the truth about him. Not only him his older brother is like this as well
Saqlain...
Silence... please file a report against him.
Our sister is naive. That man provoked her into stealing the jewelry.
What is the girl's name?
Ramsha.
I'm reporting that your sister has gone missing.
I'll also mention that man kidnapping her. But you'll have to file the report for stealing separately.
How much time will it take you to find my sister?
God willing, we will try our best.
We'll try to find your sister. We'll update you soon.
Thank you... Areeba... sit in the car. Go, I want to talk to him.
Inspector, I request you to find her as soon as possible.
She's about to get married, if this gets leaked, we will be defamed.
Don't worry, we'll try our best.
There was no need for that.
It's nothing but money for sweetmeats and tea.
Thank you...
No need for that. You have to file a theft case of fifty lacs on that man.
Don't worry about it.
Thank you.
Ramsha, pick up!
Where are you going? That too at this hour.
I'm going home.
I'll see what brother Saqlain did. Let me know if you find out anything about Mahir.
Farewell.
Okay...
I'll let you know.
Sister Salma... serve breakfast.
It's ready, have a seat, I'll serve it right away.
That is Ramsha's can driver. Didn't you ask him not to come?
I forgot about it. I need to give him money. I'll send him away, until then have breakfast served.
