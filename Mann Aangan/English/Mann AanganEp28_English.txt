I knew you wouldn't eat anything and starve.
Actually I wasn't hungry. I didn't feel like eating.
And this soup is the solution for all problems. Have it please.
I just have a little flu, not a big problem. You don't have to go through all this trouble.
You shouldn't be worrying.
Just think of it as me keeping myself busy by worrying about you.
I know you are disturbed since yesterday.
You got fever because you kept thinking about it.
Sometimes you take things to your head and this is their result.
Getting worried doesn't solve anything but instead creates more problems.
I have to go to office and work. Do you want me to keep sitting here?
Did you have lunch?
No. I will.
I'll go and heat up the food.
No. You finish this soup and take your medicine. After this you can do anything.
I don't feel like it.
Please.
Did you make it?
No.
I did make it.
Its good.
Your wife is very weak. We did house chores for years,
and your sister washes a lot of clothes on Saturdays.
And look at your wife. She did some laundry one time and got fever.
She just needs an excuse for her husband to look after her.
Mom she really has a high fever.
If you don't believe me, go in the room and see.
This happened because she was very upset about yesterday.
Mom, brother is right. She was really unwell yesterday.
You keep quiet.
She doesn't work because she has her exams. Will I do the house chores then?
No mom. The maid comes for cleaning. Ask her to do the laundry as well.
So that your wife doesn't have to do any house chores. Amazing.
Mom, she has a job and has CSS exams as well.
What? What did you say?
She has her exams after four months. She needs time for preparation.
Listen to this. I'm against her working and now she wants to work further.
Mom, why are you after her job?
She has such a good job. Do you want her to sit at home and clean?
Aima?
I'm talking to mom.
She has never misbehaved with me but ever since Mahnoor came, she sticks to her and has started to misbehave with me?
Eat your food. Don't bother me.
Ramsha, what is it? Why are you crying? Tell me.
Please come home. When will you come?
See Ramsha, had I felt well, I would come. Even Areeba was calling me. Maybe Saqlain wanted to discuss about mom.
But tell me first why are you crying? I'm worried. Tell me.
I was standing outside the university waiting for the van. The tyre got punctured and I thought I'd book a cab. Mahir came and he said he would drop me and I said okay.
As soon as I came outside, Saqlain saw and started taunting me. You know how he speaks and doesn't even bother.
You could have told me that Mahir helped you by dropping you.
They didn't even give me a chance. Areeba said so much and in fact that day when Mahir came to give the bag at home, Saqlain taunted me and said to stay away from him because he is Faraz's brother.
Stop crying. I'll come tomorrow and talk to mom and Areeba.
Don't worry.
Please come and handle Saqlain.
Yes promise. Take care. Bye.
Sir, the entire office is empty. Only you and I are left.
I'm just leaving. I'm sorry you had to stay back because of me.
It seems that since mam isn't here, you're working for her as well.
Just needs this done.
I need to check this.
Sir, do you want tea or coffee?
No. I'll just leave.
You people get emotional too soon. If you had seen Ramsha with her class fellow, you should have given her a chance to explain.
It wouldn't be odd for you to see Ramsha with her class fellow.
People with bad intentions don't take lifts from others.
No. They get off at the stop like you.
Mom, I know Mahir only helped Ramsha. I asked Ramsha's van driver and his van broke down yesterday. And Ramsha,
was coming on a riksha.
You should have told me that Mahir dropped you.
You didn't even give me a chance to talk.
I don't understand one thing. We are related to Faraz so he rushes here for our help just because he wants to get in our good books.
But why is his brother doing all these favors? He came to give the bag that day.
Aima sent him with it. I know. And its only for a year. She wants to study, let her.
Then we'll get her married.
I don't know whether I have that much time or not.
My heart is very restless. I just want Ramsha to get married and then I'll be at peace.
Mom.. Why are you saying this?
I just her to get married?
Why are you saying all this? Do you think we needed you only till here?
Will you be done once you get us all married?
Its not that. We will need your prayers and supports always. And this is just a small surgery and it'll be done and you'll be at peace then.
As God wishes.
Was she less to spoil my plan that Faraz is now siding with her. Now this useless surgery. It will be a useless expense.
I was thinking that this old women was a loser and now this.. I'll have to do something about Faraz or else he'll spoil everything for me.
Hello.
Hello. May you live long.
Mom, this. Keep this money.
Did you get your salary?
Yes.
Please count them.
This is more money. Keep this too. This is for Aima. I can't give altogether so I'll give you gradually.
You save them.
Yes dear. I spend very wisely because I know you have a lot of responsibilities.
Just pray for me for everything to be good.
As God wills.
And Mahir's fee..
Don't give the money to him. Give me the money. I'll pay it.
Alright as you say. Where is he by the way?
He stepped out.
He's always out mom. Make him understand, its not safe for him to stay out.
I do but he doesn't listen. He just stepped out.
How can it be? I can make a mistake once but not twice. I remember I got cash from the ATM. Who can take my money?
I kept them here. Where can they be?
Mahnoor? Is everything alright? Is mom alright?
Yes. She's absolutely fine.
Then why do you seem so worried?
I am trying to remember something but I cannot.
In your bag?
No. I was looking for something in my bag.
Alright. This.. This..
This?
 You know my salary. I can afford this for now.
Now you can spend it in a week or a day. Its up to you.
Are you giving me pocket money?
Yes.
But why? I have money. I got my salary today.
Yes. I know. But this is my responsibility. Like I give mom money for the house expenses, pocket money to Aima and Mahir..
But they are your responsibility.
You're my responsibility too.
I cannot give you more. They're very less. But I should be used to bearing your expenses.
No need for that. In fact I was thinking to contribute some in the house expenses.
Not at all. Don't even think about it. Don't turn people's suspicions to the truth that I married you for your money.
I don't understand who gave Rameez the address for here. It cannot be that he gets the address for here.
Actually, I went to the market and he followed me there.
I was scared looking at his attitude.
We should be scared. What did you do to him? You promised him my hand in marriage and took all his money.
I? Whats wrong with you?
You faked being in love with him.
I didn't fake it. I really love him but he cannot fulfill all my wishes. This is just one reason.
So then worry about who worries about you. If he finds out, it'll be a problem.
What will be a problem?
Whats wrong? Why are you two scared? Whats bothering you?
Actually, mom was scared that if Areeba finds out about us, it will be a problem because nobody knows about me. Not even your family or the world.
And your family will support the woman who is rightfully sitting in your house.
And if Areeba finds out that I'm your wife, she can pressurize your wife and do anything.
Nobody can pressurize me or speak about my decisions.
I have never given anybody the right to dictate me so relax.
But dear how long will you keep riding in two boats?
I'm telling you, leave her. See you're married now and you'll have a child soon.
Leave her.
Didn't I tell you I've not given anybody the right to dictate me.
If you're ready, should we go?
Yes.
Nobody can dictate me. He thinks he's very sensible.
Here is our ice cream.
Thank you.
Welcome.
What is it?
What?
Why such a long face? You weren't eager to come with me as well. All good?
No. I wasn't in a bad mood or why would I show you attitude?
Okay.
I am just scared because Saqlain saw us together and reacted and now Mahnoor also saw us. I'm just scared.
So what happened? You don't have to be scared. Mahnoor has handled everything.
You have permission to go to university, why are you worried?
What if they see us together then?
Then don't meet me. Why are you after me? You befriended me and came to me. You know very well that I don't have any less friends.
So, this means if we don't talk, it won't make a difference to you. All your other friends and I are on the same page?
See Ramsh..
Special friends are very special. Courageous and powerful.
They don't let anything sabotage their relationships so please kick this fear out of your mind.
Look at me, I'm here with you and it won't make a difference if my family saw you with me.
You're the one who is tensed and if you have so much problems don't come. Otherwise,
I am not dying to meet you.
So, ice cream?
Hmm. Ice scream.
Hello.
Hello. You here?
I came to return your book. I borrowed it to read. You're right, if we start reading we'll get the hang of it. It was interesting than that boring digest. I finished it.
Its good and if you want any other book, you're welcome to take it. You don't need my permission.
Thank you.
Ramsha told me you lost the chain that Faraz gave you. Its obvious, someone from your house took it.
Okay. Ready? One. Two..
I forgot to tell you and you didn't even remember.
What do you mean?
Tell me, did you lose something today? You're more forgetful than me.
Here. Your ring.
You forgot in the bathroom. The maid gave it to me and I kept it here safely.
Yes. May be I was in a hurry.
I didn't tell mom or else she would have started her lecture.
Thank you.
Please be careful. I was standing over her so she gave it to me otherwise anybody can take it because its so valuable.
I'll be careful next time.
 Alright
Wow.
Didn't I tell you I'd win. Didn't I defeat you?
When I had this bike,
it didn't run that fast.
This is my charm that the bike ran on.
We're fed up of his charm. He doesn't let us win any girls and now our bikes have deceived us as well.
By the way Mahir..
You're hanging with Ramsha way too much. Are you seriously involved with her?
Have you seen Ramsha's face? Why would I be serious with her?
She's just a time pass.
But be careful.. She's family.
I'm not forcing her. She's the one whose after me.
Ansa is also mad about you.
There's a difference between Ansa and Ramsha. Ansa is very bold and Ramsha is scared.
But there's one thing.
she gives me a lot of gifts.
If she gives you so many gifts, why don't you sell them and pay me for my bike.
Do you remember you have to give me two hundred thousand?
Yes. I remember. Thats why I've kept the bike at your house.
I'll take it the day I give you the money. Lets go.
Lets.
Mom didn't say wrong. I just want you to leave Areeba. How long will I share you with her?
I have told you I will leave her. I'm not interested in that woman anymore.
You just give me a child soon so that I have a solid reason to leave her.
What do you mean?
If I don't bear any children, will you not leave her then?
I will because Saqlain doesn't like giving clarifications.
Saqlain, we've been only married for a few days and this isn't in my hand that you wish and..
Try and understand my feelings. I have burried my wish to have children in my heart since ages.
I have kept Areeba with me because I'm helpless. To tell you the truth,
I don't have any expectations from her.
I married you because I love you but I also want a family.
I will not be trapped here after bearing your children. I'm waiting for the time to get a good amount from you and to get rid of you.
This isn't your own money. You're spending Areeba and her mother's money.
Brother?
Mahir, you're home?
Did I disturb you?
Not at all.
Yes, tell me. Did you need anything?
Yes. I told you about a bike.
Yes. I remember but this month,
we need to pay your fee which is a little more. Wait a little and then we'll..
He will sell his bike. He will not wait for me. Do one thing. Pay 50 thousand as installments every month.
I'll talk to him and he'll adjust. Its a good deal. He's giving me at less price than the market rate. If we lose it,
I will not find a bike as such.
If you're so excited about the bike, take money from me.
No Mahnoor.
He's requesting you. 
I'll give him the money. We find such bikes in the market easily. Its not something novel.
You can give me that money. Take it as a loan.
Brother..
She's absolutely right. You can take loan from her and give it back to her. Please. I'm requesting.
Alright.
Thank you. Thank you so much brother and sister in law.
Why do you worry so much about small things?
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Mom you scared me. I told you I needed some money for the university. I'm taking that money.
You're becoming very carefree.
Whats wrong? Don't I need money to get things?
Even Mahi went to university. She only needed money for her fee or her books.
But you're forgetting something that Mahi worked alongside university. If I start a job..
Enough..
Finish your education. I will get you married and be rid of you.
You will not have to get rid of me.
I've found a boy for myself.
This boy is intent upon insulting me. He is so shameless. He took money from Mahnoor.
And that for that useless motorcycle.
Look at her. She got ready to give money for his useless request.
She cannot do anything for the house or her husband.
Didn't Faraz tell you he took a loan from Mahnoor?
I don't understand you. You object her earning and then you want her to contribute at home.
I don't need anything. Did you hear me?
She should sit at home and look after her house.
As it is, we should not let such women roam free. Those who have a history.
Do you remember Husna? She also bothered only about her lover.
Faraz needs to keep an eye on her and control her if he wants to stay happily married.
God knows what she'll do.
Mahnoor?
Yes.
See, I brought books for you.
I have a friend. He gave CSS exams. I told him that my wife too will appear for CSS so he recommended me some books.
So I brought some. But you have this book as well.
This?
Actually when I told Wasay I wanted to do CSS so he gifted me this book.
Let it be.
Why are you tearing it off?
The book will be spoilt.
Faraz...
Wasay holds no importance for me.
He has no place in my heart.
Then,
whether this name is here or not, it doesn't make a difference. I know I'm in your life now.
I'm waiting to get into your heart.
I'll keep this.
Thank you.
