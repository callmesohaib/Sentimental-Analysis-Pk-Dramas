[01:45] Ramsha, tell me something. What can you do for me?
[01:49] Anything
[01:52] anything means?
[01:54] I mean, stupid... I love you so much that if you ask for my life
[02:01] I will give that too
[02:02] but try asking for it once
[02:05] why should I ask you for a thing which is already mine 
[02:18] Ramsha
[02:25] what were you thinking?
[02:29] Nothing
[02:32] why are you so upset? What is your problem?
[02:36] No, there isn't any problem
[02:41] Ramsha, I don't know whether you are happy or not with this marriage
[02:45] but I am very happy
[02:49] I like you so much
[02:53] do you know, I want to keep you happy
[02:57] from every aspect & mannner
[03:00] but I cannot do all this until you don't tell me that what do you want
[03:06] what is your desire, tell me. Try telling me once, I will fulfill it
[03:18] A person's every desire doesn't get fulfilled
[03:23] Ramsha
[03:24] and... I don't need anything
[03:30] and why do you start crying in every other second?
[03:33] I feel frustrated while seeing you crying
[03:36] I get irritated!
[03:46] try to smile
[03:50] Okay
[03:51] lets go!
[03:53] lets go out for a dinner tonight
[03:59] you'll feel better
[04:03] Ok
[04:17] I'm so helpless that I cannot even mourn on my shattered dreams
[04:48] you had firm belief, right? that nobody can cross your path in the successful path of your life
[04:54] nobody can defeat you
[04:56] what you did today? You had defeated yourself
[05:00] you've closed all the ways from your own hands, Maheer
[05:03] say whatever you want to say
[05:05] everyone is scolding me, so you do as well
[05:08] I'll listen to your scoldings quietly because my bad time is going on
[05:12] that's why everyone is insulting me
[05:14] nobody is scolding you!
[05:16] We are making you realize the pain that you've given
[05:20] are you guys in a lot of pain than me?
[05:22] my future is ruined, I should be upset!
[05:25] I wish you had listened to mom & brother. You should have stayed away from Ramsha, but what you did?
[05:32] Maheer, if you had loved her truly then you hadn't done any such thing
[05:37] you would have gone to brother & sister in law with respect and would have made them realize that you are capable for Ramsha
[05:43] if you had shown some intelligence & patience then nothing as such would have happened today
[05:49] she wouldn't have got married, and you wouldn't have been in this condition. But what you did?
[05:54] I don't know
[05:56] and please leave me alone, go away from here
[05:58] but... 
[05:58] don't you get me, I said leave me alone so please leave me alone!
[06:10] but I was not in love with Ramsha
[06:13] Ramsha had never been so important in my life, she had become my contumacy because of my sister-in-law
[06:23] I had to give defeat to my sister-in-law by marrying her
[06:30] then why!
[06:32] Why I am being so restless for her right now
[06:35] why I am feeling agitated by thinking that Ramsha.. 
[06:58] mom, please forgive me
[07:02] Don't know what I had said to you
[07:06] in my anger
[07:10] I have hurt you
[07:13] No my child
[07:15] not you but Maheer has hurt me
[07:24] that boy has never listened to me at all
[07:28] he always used to do whatever he fells like. And today..
[07:32] he shot himself in the foot
[07:37] don't worry
[07:39] how shall I not worry?
[07:42] you are also worried for him
[07:46] it was your years hard work, you had spent your money on him like water
[07:51] and he...
[07:54] mom
[07:57] its about fate
[08:01] I was...
[08:04] trying to improve Maheer's future
[08:08] maybe the problem is with me
[08:09] whenever I had any expectations with anyone in my life, they had never been fulfilled
[08:15] no my child, don't think like this
[08:19] I'm not in a position to think about anything else in this situation
[08:31] oh man, this woman is after my life
[08:35] whose phone is it?
[08:39] Yasir's mother
[08:41] she is asking again & again, whether I have talked to Mahnoor or not
[08:48] refuse her, mom
[08:55] Mahnoor cannot help Yasir in this matter
[09:03] but dear, at least ask her once maybe...
why shall I talk to Mahnoor?
[09:08] I don't find it appropriate
[09:14] yes, even I don't find it appropriate that all three of you shall work in the same office
[09:20] what if it becomes a problem in the future
[09:24] its obvious, it will be a problem
[09:28] today Mahnoor will do a recommendation for Yasir's job
[09:31] after that he'll demand for promotion
[09:34] if we'l; refuse about it, then his mother will call you
[09:38] this matter will continue
[09:41] therefore its better for you to refuse right away that Mahnoor cannot help him
[09:53] what if they ended the engagement & mind it, then?
[09:56] let them end it
[10:02] Even we don't want to keep any relation with those who blackmails to keep a relation
[10:07] what are you saying, Faraz?
[10:12] I'm already so worried about Maheer, and now Aima
[10:16] let me get her married at least
[10:23] I will die peacefully if she'll get married
[10:35] Fine, don't talk to her. I'll talk to Mahnoor myself
[10:40] a lot of problems have arise in our house because of her
[10:44] So can't she help us this much?
[11:47] that wretched guy ran away with my money!
[11:50] I won't spare you, Rameez!
[11:53] I have got your car's number
[11:56] where will you go!
[12:11] I can request
[12:13] and I will request Sir Aleem, but honestly there is not seat available in our office right now
[12:20] where will he adjust Yasir?
[12:23] yes, you shall talk to him. Maybe there is slight chance
[12:28] its fine if there is no vacancy, at least our honor will stay intact in front of them
[12:33] We'll tell them that we have already recommended Yasir
[12:36] yes, tomorrow is my last exam
[12:40] I will join the office day after tomorrow, then I'll talk
[12:44] you can satisfy them
[12:48] Okay
[12:56] Mahnoor, I don't find it right
[12:58] its wrong
[13:00] We cannot control everyone as per our thinking & point of view
[13:06] but still...
[13:07] I already do nothing for you & aunty
[13:11] I'm doing a small effort for Aima, so let me do it
[13:35] My husband's name is Faraz.
[13:37] Aashir divorced me two days before my wedding.
[13:41] I am working as a commercial manager for a construction company.
[13:46] And Faraz is my colleague
[13:58] thank you! bye!
[14:00] Mahnoor
[14:03] yes
[14:04] will you meet again?
[14:07] No
[14:59] what's the matter, Mahnoor. Why aren't you receiving the phone?
[15:04] actually its an unknown number
[15:09] give it to me, let me talk
[15:10] No, no... why will you talk as its an unknown number. Let me switch it off
[15:19] let me go & check inside the kitchen that what we need to prepare for the food today
[15:26] Okay
[15:52] Mahnoor, please receive my call for once
[15:56] I want to talk to you
[15:58] for God sake, say it once
[16:01] that whatever happened I wasn't responsible for it. Let's be honest
[16:06] Will I ever be able to get free from this torment?
[16:14] why is he calling me again & again, has he gone mad!
[16:24] sister
[16:26] yes, what happen?
[16:29] nothing, I just wanted to say thanks to you
[16:33] for what?
[16:35] as you've accepted about Yasir's job, actually mom was way too worried
[16:41] no problem, but you know
[16:46] there is a lot of difference in talking & giving the job
[16:49] and I can only request
[16:52] whether he'll get the job or not, I cannot comment on it
[16:57] if you talk to Yasir, then make up his mind
[17:01] yes sister, I know that all of this is not in your control & Yasir shouldn't keep any such expectations
[17:08] but sister, what shall I do
[17:12] no problem, I will request
[17:15] rest depends upon God
[17:17] yes
[17:19] Aima
[17:21] yes sister?
[17:23] how is Maheer?
[17:28] he is quite upset, sister
[17:29] I had talked to him but he asked me to leave him alone
[17:37] no matter however Maheer is, he is a very brilliant & intelligent student
[17:41] do you know, he got a scholarship too
[17:46] I know
[17:48] and I'm disappointed that he couldn't recognize his abilities
[17:52] but sister, how did you get to know about Maheer's scholarship?
[17:59] Ramsha had told me
[18:02] sister, if you knew it then why didn't you tell brother Faraz about it?
[18:07] even you & aunty knew it, right?
[18:09] why did you guys hide it?
[18:11] because of mom..
[18:14] I had to hide this matter because of aunty
[18:17] I didn't wanted to expose her
[18:23] you know, how difficult it was for Faraz to gather the money to give to aunty
[18:30] for Maheer's fees and he...
no sister
[18:34] mom was gathering that amount for my dowry, Maheer didn't got that money
[18:39] then its a good thing that I didn't tell Faraz about it
[18:43] he would have felt bad for no reason
[18:47] In fact, aunty is gathering this amount for good purpose
[18:55] Okay take care of Maheer
[18:59] don't let him take the stress
[19:12] why are you so amazed?
[19:14] sister, how can you be worried about Maheer?
[19:18] all of you had been in a lot of pain because of Maheer & that Ramsha..
[19:29] I'm not an anger, but an ordinary human
[19:34] I cannot forgive Maheer's mistake so easily
[19:41] but if see, then injustice is done with Maheer as well
[19:46] that matter should have ended there & then when Ramsha had came back on that night
[19:52] but anyways, brother Saqlain had defamed Ramsha & Maheer in such a manner
[19:58] that we couldn't do anything
[22:09] there wasn't any update about you since so many days
[22:13] I'm asking you!
I was here!
[22:17] I had told you that I am busy in Ramsha's marriage
[22:21] so why are you shouting a lot?
[22:23] you had also started inquiring as soon as I came
[22:25] where was I, what was I doing!
I was in a hell hole, & still I am
[22:35] Saqlain
[22:40] that Rameez slipped from my hands
[22:46] but now I've got to know that he is in the same city
[22:50] also, I've got his car's number
[22:57] really? So, eventually you'll find him
[23:02] I've filed a report to the police against him
[23:05] I'll ensure to recover my 50 lacs from him!
[23:11] but the way he had hurt me
[23:14] I'll punish him in such a manner that he'll remember for lifetime
[23:20] I had lost my baby because of him
[23:24] yes
[23:26] you are right
[23:28] honestly, he had hurt us a lot
[23:32] maybe you had forgotten this matter in the hustle & bustle of your life
[23:36] but my heart is still bleeding
[23:43] No Fariya
[23:46] you don't have any idea that how much hurt I am because of losing my baby
[23:55] maybe God blesses us once again with a baby
[24:00] No Saqlain! don't even think about the second baby
[24:04] don't keep any expectations from me
[24:07] have you gone mad? What rubbish you are blurting?
[24:11] you know I had married you because of this baby
[24:15] earlier I was mad!
[24:16] if I had thought earlier then I wouldn't have experienced the pain that I am going through right now
[24:21] what pain do you have? You are living a luxurious life
[24:24] its what you think that I am living a luxurious life
[24:26] this house is a prison & my life is not less than a hell hole!
[24:30] you don't come home for so many days, also you don't receive my calls too
[24:34] and sometimes if you come here, then you are always worried about Areeba
[24:37] what else shall I do?
[24:40] the problems are as such over there
[24:41] you're done with me!
[24:43] you have stopped taking care of me since I had a miscarriage
[24:47] also you were never concerned about me
[24:49] who said I don't care about you? Tell me!
[24:52] when had I not taken care of you?
[24:54] won't you stop complaining?
[25:00] I've made a decision, Saqlain
[25:02] what kind of decision?
[25:03] until you don't accept me as your wife in front of this society after divorcing Areeba
[25:09] I won't become the mother of your baby
[25:12] if you agree then its fine, otherwise
[25:15] otherwise what?
[25:17] otherwise leave me
[25:21] have you gone mad?
[25:23] what rubbish you are talking?
[25:25] who had put these rubbish things in your mind?
[25:27] you mother must have done this brain washing of yours
[25:29] oh no dear...
[25:32] why will I give her wrong suggestions?
[25:35] in fact, I was explaining her not to think bad about you
[25:41] but don't know why one thing is stuck in her mind
[25:44] that you'll never leave your wife
[25:47] and... you will not accept her in front of the society
[25:51] As its is, there isn't any fault of my daughter in in
[25:57] you have also kept your relation with her a secret inside this house
[26:01] there is a right time for everything! and that time hasn't come as of yet
[26:05] Explain her!
[26:11] one more thing
[26:13] I love you, so let me stay like that
[26:17] don't compel me to become Saqlain
[26:20] otherwise you'll regret a lot
[26:23] I will make her understand
[26:28] what had you wished for as soon as he came?
[26:31] it was important to express him my wish
[26:33] now its time to end this game
[26:36] have you gone mad! First sort out the matters of this house
[26:41] I had asked Rameez to find a buyer for this house. But that fool is still wandering in this city
[26:46] today he was almost caught by Saqlain
[26:49] if he had been caught, then we would have been exposed
[26:56] I don't understand anything'
[28:24] Maheer
[28:26] Maheer, come to have dinner
[28:28] No, I am not hungry
[28:31] Maheer, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[28:32] I won't die if I won't eat for a day
[28:35] what are you saying? Come
[28:37] I'm telling you that I am not hungry. I'll eat the food once I feel hungry
[28:45] I'm feeling sleepy so I'm going to sleep
[29:15] mom, Maheer has refused. He is saying that he'll eat once he'll feel hungry
[29:20] but...
[29:21] oh mom, its fine. He can eat whenever he feels hungry
[29:29] and Mahnoor?
[29:31] she is inside the kitchen
[29:40] mom, please take some
[29:43] let me serve you
[29:54] don't know whether he gave the phone to Ramsha or not
[30:13] at what is your exam tomorrow?
[30:16] yes? its in the morning
[30:20] So, I'll drop you
[30:23] No, what's the use of it? I will go myself
[30:26] As it is, I hardly get any cab from there to come back
[30:30] I'll pick you too from there, its not a problem
[30:33] No, you go & do your work at office as there is a lot of work over there
[30:38] I'll manage it myself, and then the car is already here
[30:51] are you sure?
[30:52] yes
[30:57] Okay
[31:25] So Mahnoor heard mine & Ramsha's discussion
[31:28] yes
[31:31] she came to my house to talk to me & to create a chaos
[31:35] but I scolded her by saying
[31:38] that its not the way to go to someone's house uninformed
[31:45] yes
[31:49] sit
[31:59] Saqlain, you know these people are not of my standard
[32:05] people take appointments to meet me
[32:08] I do have an idea about it, brother Toqeer
[32:12] that's why I had answered Mahnoor bluntly
[32:15] and the motive behind telling you is that
[32:18] you shall keep Ramsha away from Mahnoor
[32:23] because she is like this
[32:26] I think maybe..
[32:28] Ramsha had a fight with her sisters, & that's why they aren't talking to each other
[32:33] maybe
[32:36] don't you know about it?
[32:41] I do have some idea
[32:44] also you didn't tell me that why everyone's mood was off on the wedding day
[32:49] even Ramsha was so quiet
[32:54] brother Toqeer, you are an intelligent man & you can get an idea
[32:58] Ramsha is not happy with this marriage, I mean..
[33:03] Ramsha has been convinced for this marriage
[33:06] otherwise, she wasn't ready for this marriage
[33:13] how did you convince her?
[33:14] brother Toqeer, I had convinced her just like that. Leave this topic
[33:18] give some time to Ramsha
[33:20] everything will be fine with time
[33:24] I'm trying to give her time
[33:28] I've been treating her lovingly
[33:32] I think she has some insecurities, maybe with time they'll get over
[33:38] yes absolutely
[33:39] brother Toqeer, that factory..
[33:42] yes, I've seen the location but I couldn't finalize the amount. I want you to come with me
[33:49] Okay
[33:57] I'm getting a call from my house
[34:00] talk to them peacefully, I'll leave after having a two minute conversation with Ramsha
[34:04] No, you stay here. I have some important work with you
[34:09] all good?
[34:11] yes, there was a shipment on the port
[34:15] it is not getting cleared although I have bribed them. You know how it works here
[34:22] anyway, let me receive the call then we'll discuss
[34:40] listen
[34:42] tell Ramsha, Mr. Saqlain is here to meet her
[34:45] if she makes any excuse then there is no need to listen to her
[34:48] just tell her its very important to talk to her, so she should come downstairs quietly
[34:52] Okay, let me go & call her right away
[35:04] Maheer
[35:07] this boy is still sleeping
[35:10] he hasn't eaten anything since so long
Maheer
[35:15] Maheer
[35:21] Oh!
[35:23] he is suffering with such a high grade fever, he is bringing like fire
[35:27] Maheer
[35:28] oh God, what shall I do? Even Faraz is not at home
[35:33] Aima
[35:36] Aima, quickly bring ice cold water & towel
[35:40] Maheer is burning in fever
[35:42] also call Faraz, if he can come home
[35:47] oh God please show mercy

[36:24] so what shall I do?
[36:26] he is calling you
[36:29] go & tell him that either I am busy or sleeping
[36:34] but he was saying that its important to meet you
[36:36] Also he was saying that she shouldn't make any excuse
[36:43] Okay, you go. I'm coming
[36:48] Okay
[36:56] he has already pushed me into a hell hole
[37:00] don't know why does he come here daily?
[37:10] my child open your eyes, Maheer
[37:13] Maheer
[37:15] what happen to my child

[37:20] he is suffering with very high grade fever
[37:23] Okay don't you worry, let me go & bring the doctor
[37:27] don't know how much time Faraz will take to come
[37:30] yes please go & bring the doctor
[37:33] until then I'll put some cold water strips on his head, maybe the fever gets down
[37:38] I have asked Aima to bring some ice & water
[37:41] dear, please quickly go
[37:43] yes
[37:49] oh God!
[37:51] why are you putting me into a trial one after another
[37:58] open your eyes my child
[38:03] Maheer
[38:05] what happen to you?
[38:08] Maheer
[38:14] oh God, please bless my child with good health
[38:36] yes?
[38:40] say, whatever you wanted to say to me
[38:42] have you forgotten how to respect your elders as soon as you left the the house?
[38:46] you have also forgotten how to talk to your elder brother
[38:52] greetings!
[38:59] greetings to you too!
[39:02] how are you?
[39:06] how am I looking to you?
[39:13] you are looking so nice in this luxurious house
[39:16] do pray for me whenever you offer prayers
[39:21] that because of me you got married into such a house
[39:26] where you'll spend your entire life in luxuries
[39:30] otherwise that Maheer
[39:33] what he could give you?
