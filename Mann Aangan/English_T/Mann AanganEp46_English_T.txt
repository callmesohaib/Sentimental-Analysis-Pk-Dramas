[01:13] Saqlain, what did you do about my work?
Don't worry, it will be taken care of...
[01:20] I know it's getting delayed, but there's nothing to worry about.
[01:25] I hope it isn't too late.
What are you saying?
[01:33] As long as I'm here nothing will be late. Don't worry and trust me.
[01:40] I'm thinking...
[01:44] of buying a house here.
Here in Karachi?
[01:51] Are you thinking of shifting to Karachi?
[01:55] Yes, I will have to spend time here. I will have to keep Ramsha in a proper home after the wedding.
[02:08] Give me some advice. Where should I look for a house?
[02:14] I have a lot of locations. It depends on what you like.
[02:18] And I know what you like. This will be done as well.
[02:37] Good relationships are hard to find. Especially for a girl who has already tried to run away from home.
[03:11] You look stressed and depressed to me.
[03:17] You're completely wrong. It's nothing like that.
I can never be wrong about you.
[03:29] I still haven't married anyone, because, to this day, I've still been waiting for you.
[03:53] What is the matter?
[03:58] Nothing...
[04:01] Did your paper go well?
Yes.
[04:12] You went home, was everything alright? Was there an argument?
[04:21] No... everything will get better once Ramsha is married.
[04:29] You're saying that?
[04:32] Why?
[04:34] Can't I say that?
[04:42] This is what's better for Ramsha... sister Areeba is very worried for her.
[04:49] How long will sister Areeba and brother Saqlain look after her? I think this is what's best for Ramsha.
[04:57] At least this way she won't have to listen to anyone.
[05:03] That is completely different.
[05:06] But you're the one who says that marriage is not the solution for everything.
[05:13] Maheer...
[05:16] is my younger brother. But still, I don't think he's suitable for Ramsha.
[05:26] Otherwise, I would have talked to my mother about it. Anyways, forget it.
[05:37] What is the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?
[05:42] You're very nice.
[05:45] There's none like you.
Thank God that you learned that on time.
[05:54] Did you make this coffee, or did you have Aima make it?
[06:00] I made it myself.
[06:04] How do you like it? A single sip has washed all my fatigue.
[06:10] Thank you.
[06:14] It's because it's a coffee made less with coffee and more with love.
[07:10] Do you know with whom Mahnoor came home today?
Yes, I'm sure it was with Faraz.
[07:16] No... she came here with Wasay.
[07:22] When I was standing on the balcony, I saw Wasay dropping her off at our doorstep.
[07:32] Wasay dropped Mahnoor? Where and when did she meet him?
[07:39] That I don't know. But I want to know why he met her.
[07:46] Did Wasay run into Mahnoor... or did Mahnoor...
[07:52] went to meet him?
What are you saying? How can Mahnoor do this?
[08:01] I don't know what to think. Lord knows what Mahnoor wants to do now.
[08:09] Mahnoor is married now... she is happy in her home. Faraz is a good man...
[08:17] and he takes good care of Mahnoor as well.
There is a big difference between care and love.
[08:26] Forget it.
No, I will ask Mahnoor about this.
[08:31] Don't you dare talk to her about this?
[08:33] You will not say anything to her. If she shares something with you then you can talk to her about it, but not before that.
[08:46] Who is this? Who threw this?
[08:50] Let me teach you...
Saqlain...
[08:54] What is this?
There is something written on this.
[08:58] What is it?
[09:00] Pack your stuff and jewelry by tomorrow night. Both of us will run away and marry each other.
[09:08] Mahir...
[09:16] Ramsha...
Listen...
[09:18] Listen to me...
Ramsha!
[09:25] If you step a foot out of this house, I'll...
Don't say anything to her...
[09:29] Why shouldn't I? Otherwise she'll run away.
[09:31] She doesn't even know...
Did you not read the letter... what is written in this letter?
[09:35] The letter says to pack your clothes and jewelry and that you two will marry each other in court.
[09:40] Saqlain...
What? If he comes here I'll end him. My name is Saqlain!
[09:49] What are you saying? I don't understand.
Your lover is coming... it's written here in this letter.
[09:56] It's nothing like that...
It shouldn't be! Otherwise, I'll kill you and him!
[10:01] Come with me... I'll lock her in the room.
Do whatever you want, but I don't want her leaving anywhere!
[10:06] I'll lock the door from outside.
[10:44] Ramsha, what are you saying? I threw a letter?
[10:48] Yes... brother Saqlain just showed it to me.
[10:52] He thinks that I'm planning to run away. He's locked my bedroom door as well.
[10:56] Brother Saqlain was so angry that he said that he would kill me.
Isn't he overreacting?
[11:04] He can't touch me, I challenge him. I will make you run away with me, marry you in court and your family won't be able to do anything.
[11:13] Mahir...
Ramsha, what do you want?
[11:18] I just want you.
[11:22] That's the only thing you can do locked in your room.
[11:28] What should I do? They will force me to marry someone.
Are you cattle?
[11:33] You're a human, you have your choices and your life.
[11:39] What should I do? I requested sister, but she was not willing to listen.
[11:46] If it were up to sister Areeba she would marry me tomorrow, because she just wants to get rid of me.
[11:53] Alright, leave them then.
[11:58] Look... if you want to spend your life like you want it, then you need to be a little brave.
[12:05] What do you mean? I'm coming to you.
[12:09] To pick you up.
[16:37] She's left home, she's outside.
[16:41] Be careful. I want to know where they go.
[17:36] Areeba...
[17:38] Areeba... get up! Are you on your drugs?
[17:43] Do you want anything?
Ramsha's not here! She's ran away!
[17:47] What?
Her room's unlocked. She's not at home. She's ran away with that man!
[17:54] No... you have it wrong. Ramsha cannot do this...
[18:00] I locked her myself. Then how can she run away?
How do I know? I was locking up and the outside gate is open.
[18:06] Ramsha's door is unlocked as well. If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
[18:17] Take a look.
[18:43] She took the jewelry that was there.
It's possible that she had a duplicate key.
[18:47] I could never imagine she could go this far, otherwise, I would have asked you to tie her up, before locking her.
[18:53] Where can she go?
[18:57] God... what test is this?
[19:02] What test is this?
[19:19] Who are you calling right now?
[19:22] Mahnoor... I'll tell her that her brother-in-law ran away with Ramsha.
No need to tell her anything. Let's go there to talk to her.
[19:45] Where were you? Hurry up!
[19:50] Tell me, where will we go at this hour?
Where else than Hansa's place?
[19:56] Your friend Hansa?
She's my best friend and I know that I'm safe there.
[20:01] The most important thing is that we'll adjust there easily. Don't argue and come with me.
[20:08] Don't worry at all. I'm with you. Now that you're here...
[20:13] please I'm requesting you. Come with me.
[20:20] Sit down.
[21:26] What are you guys doing here at this hour? Is everything alright?
Where's your brother Mahir?
[21:32] Sister Areeba... brother Saqlain what happened? Why are you asking this?
Because his brother has ran away with Ramsha.
[21:53] What? If you don't believe me... read this.
[22:08] It's written here that the two of them have run away. He made Ramsha steal jewelry as well.
[22:19] Why are you alleging Mahir falsely? He's in his room and his bike...
[22:35] Where is his motorcycle?
[22:39] Faraz... I saw Mahir taking his bike out, but I never imagined it.
[22:48] I had no idea that your brother will try to compromise the respect of my home.
[22:53] Your brother has provoked my sister to run away.
All of them are in on it Areeba.
[22:59] I'll file a case against Mahir with the police. I'll tell them that he has kidnapped Ramsha.
[23:03] What's the matter with your Saqlain?
[23:05] You can't punish Faraz for what Mahir did. Faraz, call Mahir and ask him where he is.
[23:13] Sure, I'll call him.
[23:19] Sister Areeba come inside, let's talk inside.
How can I come inside?
[23:24] I'm scared... God forbid, what if something bad happens?
It won't!
[23:32] Don't even think like that. We'll find them.
[23:40] He's not picking up.
[23:43] May God question him. How could he test me at my age?
[23:48] Once I find your son I will kill him!
Lower your voice...
[23:53] It's the middle of the night... and your voice is echoing in the neighborhood.
Let them hear what your children have done.
[23:59] Let them hear how well you raised them. One son beats up his wife and ousts her from the house and the other one...
[24:06] provokes a girl, from an honorable family to run away with him.
For God's sake, brother Saqlain be quiet!
[24:12] What do you want to prove by insulting auntie and humiliating Faraz? They are not at fault.
[24:19] Mahir is the one who made the mistake and he is the one who should be punished.
[24:24] What do you want to prove by screaming so loudly? Do you want to defame Ramsha?
[24:30] Ramsha will be defamed!
[24:33] If she doesn't come home tonight...
[24:39] then we won't be able to show our faces to anyone.
[24:44] I'll go to Mahir's friends' house... maybe he's with one of them.
[24:49] I'll come with you as well.
We'll come as well, maybe we'll find her there.
[24:55] Come on, we'll try this as well.
[25:07] Alright, you guys won't have any problem here.
[25:11] You guys can stay here as long as you want.
[25:15] And... what about your mom and dad?
[25:19] Mom and dad are both in the UK. I and my servants are the only ones that are home.
[25:25] But yes, none of them know who the two of you are and why you're here, alright?
[25:31] Thank you so much.
[25:38] Anytime Mahir... I was thinking that you...
[25:47] Forget about it. It's getting late...
[25:52] You two should sleep.
Good night*
[26:04] Listen...
[26:07] How long will we stay here?
We will...
[26:13] stay here for a few days. I'll tell all my friends tomorrow and then we'll marry each other in court in a few days.
[26:23] Then no one will be able to separate us.
[26:29] We'll be one, forever.
[26:33] Alright.
[26:35] And yes... you will sleep upstairs.
[26:39] The room on the first left of the stairs is yours.
[26:44] And I'll sleep here, somewhere.
[26:50] Yes, but when I wake up, please call me, I'll come to you immediately.
[26:58] Bag...
[26:59] Sure...
[27:04] Good night*
[27:53] Am I making a mistake? Have I made a mistake by running off with Mahir?
[28:19] I wonder if sister Areeba and brother Saqlain know if I'm gone or not.
[28:25] No... they must be sleeping by now.
[29:42] What happened?
[29:46] He has turned off his phone.
Oh God... where should I hide myself.
[29:55] Her brother-in-law is threatening us with the police. What if he complains to the police?
[30:03] Why is he testing me? Call him again.
[30:19] Keep calling him. Maybe it's the problems with the network.
[30:28] No, brother Faraz. Mahir didn't come here.
Khurram don't lie to me right now. I'm worried sick.
[30:34] I'm not lying, you can check inside. If you don't believe me, you can confirm with my parents. He's not here.
[30:46] When did you last talk to him?
I didn't talk to him today. I called him but he didn't pick up.
[30:53] He didn't reply to any messages as well.
Ask the rest of his friends, but don't tell them that I'm asking.
[31:02] Alright, I'll call them.
[31:09] Saqib, what are you doing? Sorry for disturbing you, tell me, did you talk to Mahir today?
[31:17] He's not picking up. Alright, thank you, farewell.
[31:31] There is only one solution for this now Faraz. I'm going to the police station to file a complaint against your brother.
[31:39] Brother Saqlain... listen to me... don't involve the police. I'll find Mahir and Ramsha.
[31:51] Farewell brother Faraz.
[32:26] Faraz... did you find out anything about Mahir? Did you find him?
[32:33] No...
[32:41] I don't know what was he thinking when he did this.
[32:49] God forbid, if this reaches Aima's in-laws...
[33:01] Faraz... do something... find out where he is.
[33:07] What if we're late? What if he marries Ramsha?
[33:12] Where should I look for him? I've searched the entire city. I've talked to all of his friends. He hasn't contacted any one of them.
[33:25] Mother.... what if they left the city?
[33:32] God... God... was this the only thing that was left remaining.
[33:38] Weren't we humiliated enough? Did you see how much Saqlain was screaming?
[33:45] Our neighbors heard it as well. The news will spread to everyone
[33:49] Mother, what's with you? What are you saying?
[33:54] You're worried about the neighbors. I'm worried about Ramsha, she's a girl.
[34:04] And... what will the neighbors say?
[34:08] They will taunt Mahir as they did me. What difference does it make?
[34:16] Just once, think about Mahnoor's sister.
[34:19] She will be defamed by all this. She will have to face so much embarrassment.
[34:29] I'm disappointed in my brother. I always thought he was brash and emotional. But he turned out to be a vile man!
[34:38] Not once did he think about the girl and her respect.
[34:43] And Saqlain has gone to the police station to file a complaint.
Stop him!
[34:49] Stop him...
I can't stop him.
[34:54] Mahnoor my dear, make him understand, he will listen to you.
[35:14] God... only You can do some sort of miracle.
[35:29] Go away. What is the matter?
[35:33] My name is Saqlain and I'm here to report that my sister is missing.
[35:40] What's her age?
Twenty-three years old.
[35:45] Meaning she's an adolescent.
[35:47] Yes.
When was she kidnapped? Do you have any suspicions?
[35:52] She's been missing since last night.
[35:54] It could be that she left on her own. Did she fight with someone at home?
[36:00] It's nothing like that, but there is a guy who has provoked her.
[36:06] He has ran away with her... and there is jewelry worth fifty lacs missing as well.
[36:14] Please... file a kidnapping against him.
[36:18] That's strange. The girl is an adolescent. She ran away from home with the jewelry because of a guy.
[36:26] We cannot file a kidnapping case against the man. The girl ran away.
[36:31] Look, that man is a thug.
[36:34] If he investigate about it in his area, you'll find out the truth about him. Not only him his older brother is like this as well
[36:42] Saqlain...
Silence... please file a report against him.
[36:50] Our sister is naive. That man provoked her into stealing the jewelry.
[36:57] What is the girl's name?
Ramsha.
[37:00] I'm reporting that your sister has gone missing.
[37:04] I'll also mention that man kidnapping her. But you'll have to file the report for stealing separately.
[37:12] How much time will it take you to find my sister?
God willing, we will try our best.
[37:16] We'll try to find your sister. We'll update you soon.
[37:20] Thank you... Areeba... sit in the car. Go, I want to talk to him.
[37:40] Inspector, I request you to find her as soon as possible.
[37:45] She's about to get married, if this gets leaked, we will be defamed.
[37:49] Don't worry, we'll try our best.
[37:59] There was no need for that.
It's nothing but money for sweetmeats and tea.
[38:04] Thank you...
No need for that. You have to file a theft case of fifty lacs on that man.
[38:12] Don't worry about it.
Thank you.
[38:25] Ramsha, pick up!
[38:41] Where are you going? That too at this hour.
I'm going home.
[38:45] I'll see what brother Saqlain did. Let me know if you find out anything about Mahir.
[38:51] Farewell.
Okay...
[38:55] I'll let you know.
[39:05] Sister Salma... serve breakfast.
It's ready, have a seat, I'll serve it right away.
[39:14] That is Ramsha's can driver. Didn't you ask him not to come?
[39:19] I forgot about it. I need to give him money. I'll send him away, until then have breakfast served.
