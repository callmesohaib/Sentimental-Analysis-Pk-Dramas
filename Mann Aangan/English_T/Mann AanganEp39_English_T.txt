[01:03] In this world, no matter what we do, no matter how hard we try...
[01:09] to make people happy. No matter how hard one tries to do things the people's way...
[01:15] one is unable to do it.
[01:22] No matter how hard we try, there is someone in this world...
[01:28] who will always be unhappy with us.
[01:32] No matter how you are and how you aren't...
[01:37] I understand.
[01:42] The honor with which you do your work, the honor with which you handle your relationships...
[01:49] not everyone can do it.
[01:56] You are a good son... you are a good brother...
[02:01] and a good husband as well.
[02:07] And in my heart, there is a lot of respect for you.
[02:18] That means that things have not gotten forward. They have not yet reached love.
[02:25] Things have gotten farther than that.
[02:31] The place you have in my heart is much greater than this.
[04:38] Listen...
[04:42] How will we solve this problem?
What problem?
[04:47] Look how the thieves got in last night and scared us.
[04:53] We haven't even slept well for the past two days.
[04:57] Areeba, the purpose of a thief is to steal and even though they have gotten in twice, they haven't stolen a thing.
[05:07] Yes but... they have vandalized all the mirrors of the house.
[05:13] It's possible that he would have stolen something if you hadn't come on time.
[05:20] That's what I'm surprised at. How come he disappeared before I arrived?
[05:26] I'm not a policeman, nor do I have a weapon.
[05:32] That means that whoever is breaking in has no intention to steal anything.
[05:41] What intention could they possibly have?
[05:45] To scare the people of this house and make them run away.
[05:50] Everyone knows that auntie isn't among us anymore.
[05:59] Do you remember that guy?
What guy?
[06:04] That same guy who was after Ramsha's sister. The one who threw letters on Ramsha's roof.
[06:09] Remember how the neighbors cursed him?
Yes, I remember him.
[06:13] I think he did this. Knowing full and well that Ramsha is alone, he wants to take advantage of it.
[06:22] Anything can be possible.
[06:26] Anyways... there is no need for you to worry. I'm here with you guys today.
[06:32] Areeba please, keep an eye on Ramsha.
[06:37] Auntie knew everything about Mahnoor did, but if Ramsha does something stupid...
[06:44] then I don't you and I to face humiliation because of it...
[06:50] Please... do you understand?
[06:55] Yes, I understand.
Anyways, ask the maid to clean this up.
[07:02] Yes, I'll ask her to do it.
[07:09] Sister Salma!
[07:22] The work he did is nice. He's good.
[08:03] What's the need to dress up so much to go to university?
[08:13] This is how I always go to university.
[08:17] That's what I'm asking, why are you going to university so dressed up?
[08:21] You go to study there, not to attend a fashion show.
Mother...
[08:27] Look Ramsha... we need to be very careful. Things outside are not good.
[08:37] Mother isn't alive anymore. She used to handle everything before, not it all falls on my shoulders.
[08:46] That's why I don't want anyone to even look at you. I don't want to give the neighbors anything to talk about.
[08:55] Try and understand what I'm saying. Remove some of your makeup.
[09:30] Please try to talk to Ramsha with affection.
[09:36] She'll understand what you'll say. She just feels that she's alone.
[09:43] She's just upset at you. She feels as though you don't care about her.
[09:50] What does it matter what she says? I care for her and that's why I want to talk to her.
[09:59] Don't worry about it, we'll cheer her up once she's here.
[10:19] Greetings.
[10:21] Greetings to you too.
How are you? Are you well?
[10:25] Why are you here?
I came here to talk to you. I was worried about you.
[10:30] Worried? Do you even care for anyone but yourself?
[10:43] Are you saying that?
I don't want to talk to you.
[10:47] Ramsha please, listen to me. You once called me your brother...
[10:54] If you did, please listen to me.
My van will be here any moment, I'll get late.
[11:00] That's not a problem, we'll drop you off. Let's sit and talk together.
[11:07] If I'm late, what will I say to sister Areeba?
[11:16] Tell them you went for an extra class, or you can tell her that we picked you up.
[11:21] No, if she finds out that I'm with you she'll get upset. I'll tell her that it's an extra class.
[11:30] Sure, alright.
[11:33] Let's go...
Hi... how come you guys are here?
[11:38] Actually, we came here to pick Ramsha up for lunch.
You guys didn't even think of asking me?
[11:47] No, we decided...
Mahnoor wanted to talk to Ramsha, that's why we're going for lunch.
[11:55] I was just kidding. I was heading out with my friends for lunch.
[12:00] I wanted to talk to you, brother...
[12:07] I needed some money. I'm going out with friends so...
Sure, here you are.
[12:19] Thank you... bye.
[12:35] It's two.
[12:38] This was the time she returned yesterday,
[12:57] Sister Areeba, lunch is ready, should I serve it?
[13:02] No... we'll eat together once Ramsha is here.
Sure alright,
[13:09] Let me call her.
[13:25] She's not picking up as well.
Let me call Saqlain.
[13:31] No... he'll get worried.
[13:37] Let me wait another five to ten minutes, she'll be here.
[13:42] I don't understand brother Faraz, how can you be so sure that brother Saqlain mixed in poison with mother's medicine?
[13:51] Who else can do that?
Like you, I took have a lot of indifferences with brother Saqlain.
[13:58] But I do not agree with this.
Me too.
[14:04] Do I look insane to you two? Why would I allege an innocent person?
[14:13] No matter what it may be, you didn't see it with your own eyes.
[14:20] I don't think brother Saqlain can do this. Look how much he helps us out around the house and the property dealings. I don't think he did this.
[14:33] You know what... you don't know anything about this.
[14:38] Brother Saqlain has taken his fair share of what he did for us. 
[14:42] Our properties... our shops...
But you have no proof of that...
[14:48] Even with proof, what could I have achieved? Mother stopped me.
[14:52] She said that if I say anything, sister Areeba's home would be destroyed. She was worried about her happiness.
[14:57] What I can't understand is what could brother Saqlain gain from mother's demise. 
[15:03] Brother Faraz make her understand...
[15:10] If it weren't for brother Saqlain, sister and I would have been dead. They broke into our house.
[15:17] Please try to understand.
[15:21] Even though you're the one who's alleging him, brother Saqlain thinks that it's brother Faraz.
[15:26] He thinks that brother Faraz is misguiding you. Even though I don't believe it at all.
[15:32] Thank you for trusting me so much.
Please make sister Mahnoor understand...
[15:37] that she should apologize and put an end to things. Otherwise, things will only get worse.
[15:43] I don't want to block both of your numbers. Sister Areeba made me block it.
[15:51] Who are they to stop me from meeting you? You are my sister, and that is my home.
[15:57] They can't stop me from meeting you or entering that house.
What if brother Saqlain left me?
[16:03] Will you live with me? Or will you take me home with you?
[16:12] I cannot live alone in that house, at any cost.
[16:16] Ramsha, we have nothing against you being in our home...
[16:19] No... stay there.
[16:24] Alright... I won't come there.
Sister, why don't you solve this problem by apologizing?
[16:32] You know that falsely alleged someone and it's a sin to do that. Brother Faraz make her understand.
[16:53] Congratulations sir.
[16:56] From now on you are the official owner of this house.
[17:01] It was very smart of you to have your mother-in-law sign over both of her houses to you.
[17:09] You sold one and the other one you kept under your name. And now you're living there as well.
[17:19] I was thinking that now that I've started living there, I should start making some changes.
[17:23] How will you deal with those three sisters?
[17:27] Especially the middle one?
[17:31] I'm not worried about Areeba, she'll do as I say.
[17:37] As far as her sisters are concerned, we'll handle her.
[17:43] I'm sure you will.
[17:47] Mr. Tauqi is coming as well. Your savior.
[17:52] You'll have to make him happy as well.
[18:00] Only one thing makes me happy.
[18:04] I'll arrange for that as well.
[18:07] I have got to hand it to you... do you know what makes a person tick?
[18:13] That's why no one can come in front of me.
[18:18] Am I right, or not?
Of course.
[18:47] Ramsha...
[18:56] Yes?
[18:58] Why are you back so late?
The days I took off from university...
[19:04] I needed to take classes for that...
Couldn't you have called and told me that?
[19:11] I was so busy that I lost track of time.
I called you so many times.
[19:16] Why didn't you pick up my phone? You could have at least messaged me.
[19:21] My phone was on silent and I didn't know...
Tell me the truth, where were you?
[19:28] Did you go to university, or were you somewhere else?
I'm not lying to you, I really was in university.
[19:36] Really...
[19:39] Give me the van guy's number.
Why?
[19:43] Because I will talk to him and ask him, when he picked you up from university and when he dropped you off at the gate.
[19:52] So you don't trust me?
No, I don't.
[19:58] Why are you looking at me like this? Give me his number.
[20:04] Give me your phone, I'll take it out myself.
[20:12] I didn't come back home in a van.
[20:18] Who did you come here with then?
Sister Mahnoor.
[20:25] Sister Mahnoor and brother Faraz came outside my university. All of us went out for lunch, it's nothing else.
[20:43] Sister... sister...
[21:31] If you keep on fighting like this with them...
[21:36] then you won't be able to visit Ramsha.
[21:40] Do think about it. Until then I'll go and meet mother.
[22:03] Yes, what is it?
Sister, could you please help me?
[22:08] Yasir has been calling me for ages. Please tell him that I'm busy doing something.
[22:14] But why?
Because I don't want to talk to him. The questions he asks fluster me.
[22:22] Look... if you do this, it will make him feel bad. Don't avoid him like this.
[22:30] I think he doesn't like a thing that I say. He finds fault in everything I do.
[22:35] He asks me for a log of every minute. He asks me where I am and why my phone was busy.
[22:44] Look Aima, don't avoid Yasir like this.
[22:48] Give him some time, you guys just got engaged.
[22:54] Let him say what he wants now and in the future, you can tell him what's in your heart.
[23:02] It takes time for a relationship to form and for people to understand each other
[23:08] This will make him more upset with you.
[23:12] Alright, sister, I understand.
[24:09] Let's teach sister-in-law a lesson today. She humiliated me in front of everyone that day.
[24:17] Today, it's her turn.
[25:05] Did Maheer steal my ring?
[25:18] Maheer.
Yes?
[25:20] Give my ring back to me.
[25:22] Ring? Why would I have your ring?
[25:25] Don't try and be over-smart. I just kept that ring on my dressing table.
[25:30] You took that ring, I just saw you walking away from my room. So don't lie and return my ring.
[25:36] Sister... you are alleging me with stealing.
Alleging you?
[25:42] I'm sure that you're the one who stole the ring.
[25:45] And what proof do you have?
I saw you leaving my room.
[25:55] Sister, you're alleging me stealing.
Alleging you?
[25:59] I say, give me my ring back. There is no need for this scene.
[26:04] What's the matter Mahnoor, why are you angry at Maheer?
She's alleging me...
[26:10] with stealing her ring.
He's lying. I just kept my ring on the table before I went to the washroom...
[26:19] Maheer came to my room and he picked it up.
Mahir?
[26:22] Brother, I swear, I didn't steal that ring.
[26:31] If you don't believe me, you can search my room.
[26:36] If it's like that, then tell everyone what you were doing in my room.
[26:41] Why would I come into your room? I never come into your room.
[26:47] I come here only if I need something from my brother. I never go there in your absence.
[26:53] Why are you alleging him for no reason? Did you find no other way to create a scene inside the house?
[26:59] I have no intention of doing such a thing. My jewelry has been stolen before, and money always goes missing from my purse,
[27:06] But I always kept silent because I didn't have any proof.
[27:09] Today I saw Maheer leaving my room.
Maheer, when did you come back home?
[27:16] Brother, I just came back. Look I've not even removed my shoes.
[27:20] Faraz... he's lying. Maheer is the one who stole the ring.
Should he believe you now?
[27:27] Wait a minute.
[27:29] If Mahnoor suspects Maheer, there is nothing wrong with searching his room.
[27:36] Faraz, what are you saying?
Mother, leave it be...
[27:40] It's alright. If this removes my brother's doubts, and my sister-in-law is proven wrong, I have no problem with them searching my room.
[27:53] Brother, you can search my room.
[27:58] Please.
[28:47] What is this?
[28:53] This is my ring.
[28:56] I searched his room and he just came home, which means that Maheer doesn't have the ring.
[29:04] I admit that he doesn't have the ring, but it's possible that he hid it somewhere in the house.
[29:11] Alright then, we'll search the entire house.
What's the matter with you?
[29:15] Will you now search your mother and your sister's room? Will you frame us as thieves, for her?
[29:21] Mother, let it be... if that is what makes satisfies brother...
[29:27] then let him do it.
[30:02] Sister, why are you packing your clothes?
[30:06] I'm going home?
What are you saying? Why are you going home?
[30:15] Help them. Be a part of their schemes.
They are plotting no schemes.
[30:23] The allegations that they put on my husband, is that the truth?
[30:28] No... it's not the truth at all. In fact, I told sister Mahnoor that...
[30:35] she should apologize to brother Saqlain because she treated him the wrong way.
[30:41] You promised me that you will keep no contact with Mahnoor.
[30:49] Sister how can I not, she's our sister.
[30:56] Our sisters are supposed to be like this? She has no sympathies for you, nor does he care about you. She just cares about herself.
[31:04] If Saqlain finds out that you met Mahnoor...
[31:09] then he'll get angry. It was hard for me to convince him, I can't take more risks.
[31:17] Sister, he won't find out about it at all.
How can you say that?
[31:24] What won't I know?
[31:31] What are you two talking about?
Brother Saqlain...
[31:35] It's nothing.
I just heard you telling your sister that I won't learn about it.
[31:43] Her university is organizing...
[31:46] A trip farmhouse. She wanted permission from you and I said that you won't allow her.
[31:52] So you want to go there without telling me.
[31:55] Will you deceive me?
No.
[31:58] Listen to one thing with open ears...
[32:01] I hate deception. No one is going on this trip.
[32:11] Your mother just died a week ago.
[32:16] For her atonement, I'm having the Quran read in mosques and having charitable dinners organized...
[32:22] and you...
[32:25] want to go on a trip to a farmhouse, with boys. Just so that you can enjoy yourself.
[32:32] Go into your room and read the Holy Quran for your mother. Go!
[32:54] There are no limits to your sisters.
[32:57] Mahnoor can't help herself putting allegations on me...
[33:04] And your younger sister can't help herself from going out.
[33:10] There is no shame in everyone. Nor do they feel any pain, or have any respect.
[33:19] What have I gotten myself into by marrying your family?
[33:53] There's nothing here, we've searched the entire house, but nothing was found.
No brother...
[34:00] You haven't searched the entire house, your room comes in this house as well.
[34:06] When sister has alleged me of stealing...
[34:11] then why not we search your room? Because I don't have that ring, nor is it in the house.
[34:18] Right, sister?
What are you saying? My jewelry has been stolen...
[34:24] Why would it be in my room? I searched my room.
Don't make excuses.
[34:30] I'll search your room. Come with me.
[34:35] Shall we?
[34:44] Search all you want.
[35:12] This is the ring you were talking about, right? The one you alleged Maheer stole.
[35:30] Yes but... I kept it there. How can it be there?
[35:36] Do you see Faraz? She kept it in the drawer...
[35:41] and alleged Maheer with stealing it.
I'm telling the truth, I kept it on top of the dressing table.
[35:46] How can it be in the drawer...
[35:52] Whether it was on the table or the drawer, it was in your room, in your possession.
[35:57] You didn't check and alleged Maheer of stealing it.
Listen to me...
[36:06] What do you want?
[36:07] Why did you want to instigate a fight between two brothers by putting false allegations on Maheer?
[36:18] What will you gain from instigating a fight between them?
I'm not lying... I'm telling the truth.
[36:25] Maheer did this.
[36:29] This is not the truth. I don't know what she's saying.
[36:35] The proof is in front of everyone.
[36:39] Why did you do this?
[36:44] What was the point of all this?
She wanted to put a seed of hatred in your heart for Maheer.
[36:57] I know what's irritating her deep in her heart.
[37:02] That's why she's alleging Maheer. She wants to drive a wedge between you and Maheer.
[37:14] What do you mean?
[37:14] Meaning... that she wants to steal you from us. Steal him then...
[37:20] It's not like he was ever with us.
[37:30] He doesn't have the time to take care of his mother, nor does he have time for his brother and sister. All he has time for is you.
[37:45] Let's go.
[37:52] Faraz...
[38:44] Since you've left mother, no one here is mine. Everyone is fighting among themselves.
[38:50] Tell me... what is my fault? Why do I have to listen to everyone?
[39:03] May God save us from her. Look how she was making him look like a thief.
[39:10] What has Maheer ever done to her to receive such vile allegations from her?
[39:18] And look how you listened to your wife and searched your brother.
[39:24] Has your blood gone cold? Don't you trust your brother?
Mother, please.
[39:31] Don't say anything to brother. It's good that he searched me and cleared things, there and then.
[39:41] Otherwise, I would have been suspected for the remainder of my life.
[39:46] I think that maybe she's taking revenge on me for what happened that day.
What day?
[39:54] Did you two fight?
