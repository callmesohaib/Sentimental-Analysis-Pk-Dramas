[00:57] What need was there to be so rude?
What is the matter?
[01:00] Mahnoor...
[01:04] what were you thinking when you were disrespecting my husband?
[01:10] I did not disrespect him. I just asked him a question.
[01:16] Why did you ask that question?
[01:19] Who gave you the right to ask him questions?
[01:23] Mother might have involved him in matters of our property,
[01:27] but that doesn't mean that we can't question him on it.
[01:31] A few days ago a girl came to my office and told me that the rent of our house is being increased.
[01:37] But brother Saqlain never mentioned it to us.
[01:40] Have some shame!
[01:42] You're asking for an account from a person who brings gifts for you all daily.
[01:48] He remembers every occasion linked to this house.
[01:52] He's the one who spends money on the birthdays of you two
[01:55] He pays for the bills of this house. He does the groceries for this house and even pays the fees for your university and her college.
[02:02] Enough sister...
[02:03] Brother Saqlain never spent a penny out of his pocket on us.
[02:07] I know very well where the rent collected from our houses and shops goes.
[02:14] Maybe you're forgetting that he isn't your servant, he's my husband.
[02:20] And all of you are not his responsibility.
[02:22] He does all this because you guys are my family. He does it for my happiness.
[02:29] And you want to ruin my home.
[02:40] What are you saying? I can never think of doing that.
[02:45] I don't need explanations.
[02:49] You will call him right now and apologize.
[02:59] He has left me here.
[03:03] Lord knows if he'll come back for me or not.
[03:05] Don't worry my dear. He's angry right now.
[03:10] Mahi will apologize, don't worry.
[03:30] Sister Mahnoor, why were you so straightforward with brother Saqlain?
[03:35] We had already said so much to him jokingly.
[03:39] You have no idea how bad this will get and sister Areeba will make our life a living hell.
[03:46] I think that you should apologize to brother Saqlain.
[03:54] Not at all. I will not apologize to him. That is my final decision.
[04:52] What happened? Did you talk to Saqlain?
[04:56] He's not picking up.
[05:01] All of this is because of Mahnoor.
[05:11] Areeba, listen to me. Where are you going?
[05:22] Areeba, listen to me. Wait...
Pick up your phone.
[05:27] Call Saqlain right now and apologize to him!
[05:31] But sister...
[05:33] I don't want to hear anything. Call him and apologize.
[05:37] Don't waste time, I want to go back home.
[05:43] Mahi, can't you hear? She's right. Call Saqlain and apologize to him.
[05:48] But I haven't done anything that compels me to be ashamed and apologize to him.
[05:55] Have you no awareness of the disrespect you showed him?
[05:59] You will apologize to him. Call him...
[06:03] Otherwise...
Otherwise, what will happen?
[06:06] Mother...
I don't understand...
[06:09] When will this veil be lifted off of your eyes? Why can't you see what I'm seeing?
[06:14] You are the one who can't see straight. Can't you see what you've been doing?
[06:20] You don't care about relationships nor his respect
[06:29] All she wants is an account of things
[06:31] If I didn't care about relationships, I wouldn't have stayed silent all these years, even after knowing so much.
[06:37] What right has he stolen from you?
[06:41] He worries for you all day and night. He doesn't think about himself at all.
[06:47] And you... you didn't show him any respect.
[06:53] I feel so ashamed. How will I face him?
[06:57] He should be the one who should be worried about that.
[07:00] But he has left you here on purpose knowing that he has a blind supporter in this house.
[07:09] Do you hear her?
[07:12] Mahi, what do you want?
[07:16] Can't you see what she wants?
[07:20] She's planning to ruin my home.
[07:31] My dear, it isn't like that. I'm talking to her. Call Saqlain and tell him that whatever you said...
[07:40] was not your intention. You just said it.
[07:43] I know what I was saying. I intended on saying every word.
[07:49] And yes... I want to know the overhead expenses of our houses. So that...
[07:56] I thought you were very smart...
[08:00] but you turned out to be very selfish.
[08:05] She is selfish.
[08:08] She wants everything to go bad.
[08:12] She wants to hit the final nail...
[08:16] in the coffin. Then you guys can bury me alive...
[08:22] Areeba!
sister
[08:26] Areeba... what is all this Mahi?
[08:37] Areeba... listen to me...
[09:31] Hello... Saqlain...
[09:34] Yes, auntie?
[09:36] Thank God that you picked up. Areeba has been calling you since last night...
[09:42] but you haven't been picking up.
[09:43] With what face should I have picked up?
[09:47] After the allegations that Mahnoor put on me, with what face should I have talked to Areeba?
[09:52] Mahnoor is ashamed. She has no idea what she said.
[09:58] I apologize to you on her behalf.
[10:02] Why are you making a sinner out of me? You did nothing...
[10:07] What is your fault in this? Mahnoor is the one who put that allegation on me.
[10:12] Mahnoor will apologize to you. Just come back home.
[10:17] Auntie...
If you think of me as your mother, then trust me.
[10:23] Areeba has cried herself into a mess. Please come home, I promise you...
[10:29] that neither Mahnoor nor anyone else here will not interfere in your business.
[10:34] You accepted this responsibility to lessen my burden.
[10:37] You are not answerable to anyone and no one has the right to question you.
[10:43] My dear, spit out your anger and visit us in the evening.
[10:47] How can a son disobey his mother's orders?
[10:54] I'll come by after work in the evening.
[10:57] Farewell, my dear. Bless you.
[11:01] Farewell.
[11:08] Mahnoor is getting too bold.
[11:11] I'll have to nip her in the bud,
[11:15] otherwise, she will destroy years of my hard work.
[11:21] Greetings*
Tea...
[11:27] Mahnoor.
[11:31] I was just talking to Saqlain. He'll come by in the evening and you will apologize to him.
[11:39] But mother...
No arguments.
[11:42] This is my order. If you refuse to listen to me...
[11:47] then I will no longer be your mother.
[12:21] Should I bring something else?
No, you can leave. Thank you.
[12:28] Here you go. Have some toast, you haven't eaten anything since last night. Because of you all of us haven't eaten anything as well.
[12:38] Do one thing, bring me poison, so that I may die and all of you get rid of me.
[12:46] What are you saying? That was not a good thing to say.
[12:52] I know how much everyone cares for me.
[12:57] All of you are selfish and ungracious. The one who does wrong by me...
[13:04] will suffer as well.
[13:08] What's the matter with you?
Mother has talked to brother Saqlain...
[13:15] he is coming in the evening. I will apologize to him...
[13:19] For you and mother.
[13:23] You're cursing me being my sister...
[13:27] but I don't think that there is any woman in this world who would try to ruin her sister's home.
[13:36] I can never think of doing that.
[13:39] It would be better if you remove that thought from your heart.
[13:52] Eat this... she said that she will apologize to brother Saqlain. Here you go.
[14:00] Come on take it. I'm hungry as well.
[14:28] Thank God that you remember me.
[14:33] Why weren't you picking up?
[14:35] I was busy at home, that's why.
[14:39] You're at home? I thought you were at university. Because today...
[14:45] Sister Areeba is here, that's why I couldn't go to university.
[14:48] This wasn't the first time that Areeba came to visit you.
[14:51] You never miss your classes over something so small.
[14:56] I've been sensing that you've been silent for a few days now. I hope everything is right.
[15:03] Mahnoor, we are close enough...
[15:06] that you can share your problem with me.
[15:11] Wasay, I wanted to ask you something.
[15:16] Do you or your father know anyone who deals in property tax?
Yes.
[15:24] Definitely. I know I'll find someone.
[15:28] Are you worried about property tax?
[15:44] Hi mom...
Wasay, I need to talk to you.
[15:49] What is it?
[15:51] I want to talk to you as well.
And what is that?
[15:56] It's not that important. What do you want to talk about?
[16:01] So much time has passed and you still haven't finalized anything.
[16:04] About what?
[16:06] About your further studies. Have you decided on a university or not?
[16:11] Mom... I want to stay here for now. I'm enjoying myself doing content writing.
[16:18] And moving forward I was thinking of doing something with it.
[16:23] Enough Wasay, that is not something of your level.
[16:27] If you want to stay here and join your father's office.
[16:30] This way you'll be able to help him out. I don't know why...
[16:35] you changed your decision so suddenly. You wanted to go abroad...
[16:38] There is a reason and I will share it with you very soon...
[16:44] but I want to talk to dad about something important...
[16:48] Don't worry.
[16:59] Auntie, shall I give you some advice?
[17:03] Marry Hashir. His stubborn nature will be gone then.
[17:10] Oh really! Now I understand the reason behind you asking me to marry someone.
[17:17] It's nothing like that. I too want you to get married.
[17:23] You have made your studies everything, but I realize that you're at an age, where you should get married...
[17:30] I agree with what Saqlain says. One changes after marriage.
[17:37] Auntie is right. A man's stubbornness and ego disappear after marriage.
[17:44] Look at me... Areeba has removed all wrinkles from me.
[17:48] What remains is an obedient husband.
[17:53] Anyways... you are way too soft on Areeba.
[17:58] Not only her, you've cut her mother and her sister a lot of slack as well.
[18:03] Auntie, what can I do? I have to be this way.
[18:07] I have to maintain the peace of the house.
[18:10] Besides, if I don't take care of Areeba's mother and sisters, then who will?
[18:16] They don't have a man in their lives.
[18:18] It's big of you to care so much, even though you don't have any children.
[18:26] By now you should have married someone else.
[18:34] Mother... this is their personal matter. Why are you interfering?
[18:39] They must not want a child right now.
[18:41] It's impossible that one doesn't want children.
[18:47] That's why I say that my brother's lineage has stopped with him.
[18:53] How will it move forward? He's the last one.
[18:59] What should I do?
[19:01] I don't want to marry someone else and be unjust to Areeba.
[19:09] Anyways... forget this and tell me when are you coming to visit? It's been a while since you visited.
[19:15] I'll come by very soon. My entire attention is on finding him a match.
[19:21] I've shown him so many girls up till now, but he hasn't taken a liking to any one of them.
[19:27] He will choose one, just don't back off.
[19:38] It's my wife calling.
[19:42] Whenever she visits her mother, she calls constantly to see where I am.
[19:47] Hello... yes Areeba?
[19:49] I'm on my way.
[19:53] Alright, farewell.
[19:56] I'll get going, auntie.
[19:58] Sure, my dear. May God protect you.
[20:01] Hashir, come visit me next week.
Aye, aye captain!
[20:07] Farewell*
[21:24] I'm sorry brother Saqlain.
[21:31] Forgive me, I made a mistake.
[21:36] I...
[21:39] I didn't want to hurt you.
[21:45] But, maybe my words were wrong.
[21:51] You didn't say anything wrong. It's your right to ask questions.
[22:01] She has no right.
[22:12] Mother, I am telling you the one last time. Sort her out
[22:18] He has taken care of you more than he takes care of his family.
[22:23] Would you guys look nice asking him questions?
[22:39] What are you saying? They are obviously my family.
[22:46] And you... you cannot talk to auntie and Mahnoor in this tone.
[22:51] Please don't do this... do not get mad at Mahnoor because of me.
[23:01] Do you see the caliber of person he is... and you were suspecting his intentions.
[23:09] Areeba, people make mistakes.
[23:12] Mahnoor surely must have made a mistake.
[23:17] What does she know of my intention?
[23:22] You're right. To date, I could never get a firm grasp over what your intention is.
[23:32] Money is greater than humanity.
That's why some people make money their religion.
[23:47] Because of them, one stops believing in relationships.
[23:53] Not all people are the same. I pray to God...
[23:58] that both my daughters are blessed with a kind and caring man like Saqlain.
[24:05] Amen...
God forbid...
[24:16] Brother Saqlain I'm grateful to you for respecting my wishes.
[24:22] No auntie, what are you saying? I was going to come here after work to pick up Areeba.
[24:32] My time doesn't pass without her.
[24:37] May God keep the two of you happy.
Amen.
[24:43] What should I have made for you, for dinner?
Nothing. We'll have tea and then we'll leave.
[24:53] Tea...
Thank you.
[25:20] I'm surprised that I had no idea about this.
I'm surprised as well.
[25:27] You're preparing for CSS. You should know about property tax and the law.
[25:33] Your brother-in-law is more intelligent than you. Five years ago he had relieved himself of paying any taxes.
[25:40] Your mother doesn't know anything about that as well.
[25:46] Mother doesn't even know how much rent comes from where. He manipulated her into signing things.
[25:54] Anyways... don't stress about it. You can't do anything about it now. Be sure to be careful around that man.
[26:04] You're right. I feel very helpless and there is no point in sharing this with my family.
[26:13] He'll start blackmailing again. He could use this as an excuse to leave your sister.
[26:20] You're right. I decided to stay silent because of this.
[26:25] Anyways, thank you. I will remember this favor of yours.
[26:30] This was not a big deal. You don't need to count this as a favor.
[26:35] Anyone at work would have given you a record of this.
[26:41] Learn to distinguish between love and favors.
[26:47] Please... don't say that you don't know how I feel.
[26:55] It's not like that...
[27:15] Will you marry me?
[27:26] Please don't refuse
[27:30] It was hard for me to ask this question.
[27:37] Why? Are you scared of me?
[27:41] I fear your refusal. Otherwise, I am not afraid of anyone.
[27:47] And... what if I refuse?
[27:53] Then suicide.
[27:59] I'll jump in the ocean.
[28:05] Or in front of the train.
Please...
[28:10] Don't talk about suicide. No one dies in this world for someone else.
Don't challenge me.
[28:16] You know that I can do anything for you.
[28:28] Let me see your hand.
[30:29] Should I say if you don't take it the wrong way?
[30:32] What are you saying?
[30:36] I have never taken anything you said the wrong way.
[30:41] Areeba, I think all of you should start thinking about Mahnoor's marriage.
[30:48] She's just two years younger than you.
[30:52] I can't say anything about that. I've asked mother multiple times, but she told me that she has plans.
[31:01] I know all of that. But studying more only leads to wayward thoughts. What she said to me was wayward.
[31:14] She has apologized to you for that, you should forget it as well.
It's not that, I've forgotten everything for you
[31:26] Try and understand. Mahnoor is different from you. She enforces her will.
[31:32] In an age where girls are worried about their marriage, she's thinking of doing CSS. What will she do in civil services?
[31:44] I have no concerns about what she does.
[31:49] She hurt me that day by being rude to you.
[31:53] Look... you shouldn't be upset at your sister. She's your sister.
[31:59] She's my sister but...
[32:03] But what?
[32:08] Areeba, I feel afraid...
[32:11] What if she chooses someone that isn't equal to our standards?
[32:20] What if she chooses a fraud?
[32:27] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[32:35] Talk to auntie about this.
[32:37] It's very important.
[32:41] You're right.
[32:44] I will talk to mother.
[33:18] Let me see your hand.
[33:31] Where did you get this ring? Who put it on you? It's pretty and looks expensive as well. Tell me, who gave it to you?
[33:41] Wasay did...
Wasay, the one in your office?
[33:48] Yes...
That means soon I'll be rid of you.
[33:52] After that, I will rule over this house and I will live like a princess.
[33:58] Wow... when are you getting married?
[34:02] There is not a wedding in sight and it will remain that way for a long time.
[34:08] What do you mean by that?
It means that Wasay has just proposed, and he hasn't talked to his family.
[34:19] He will do that soon. The hardest thing for him was to propose to a girl like you.
[34:26] They are very rich people and they have a high status.
[34:31] So what? It's not like we are any less. We have properties as well.
[34:35] You don't understand. Wasay's father is a big businessman.
[34:41] So no change.
[34:43] It's not your headache, let brother Wasay take care of that.
[34:50] It will be great if you marry in a big home. Brother Saqlain will lose his pride.
[34:57] He will be bothered by it the most. Mark my words!
[35:02] What are you saying?
[35:04] One shouldn't compete with someone over being bad.
[35:09] Mother wants a son-in-law just like brother Saqlain for us.
[35:15] Why, what will that achieve?
[35:17] If she starts seeing his bad side, she will stop taking his side.
[35:22] That will only make mother feel bad.
[35:24] And... sister Areeba's house might get ruined as well. Which shouldn't happen.
[35:46] I was so confident with her. 
[35:49] I assured her that my family would have no problems.
[35:55] I'm sure dad will have the same reaction as a mom.
[36:00]  And if he doesn't I'm sure mom will compel him to listen to her.
[36:05] I don't know why they're still living in the past century, where all that mattered was family background and status.
[36:14] A person has no value based on their character.
[36:19] One thing is settled, if I'll marry someone then that will be Mahnoor.
[36:26] It's my life and no one will dictate it for me.
[36:42] I have the desire to see you married. 
[36:44] You have made your studies everything, but I know that you're at a marrying age.
[37:00] Mahnoor is seeing dreams bigger than her worth. 
[37:04] She's having an affair with the son of an industrialist.
[37:07] Until I'm alive your wishes will not be fulfilled. 
[37:11] This is an opportunity I was waiting for to avenge myself for my insult.
[37:16] See what I'll do with you now.
[37:39] Greetings auntie.
[37:46] Thank God, how are you? 
[37:49] Tell me, any updates on finding a match for Hashir?
[37:54] Has he agreed, or is he still refusing?
[37:59] Auntie, I was thinking that you should take a look at Mahnoor as well.
[38:07] I thought of Mahnoor keeping Hashir's nature in mind. 
[38:11] I don't want a simple woman like auntie falling victim to strange people.
[38:18] Ask Hashir about her. His decision will be final.
[38:24] Of course. Farewell.
