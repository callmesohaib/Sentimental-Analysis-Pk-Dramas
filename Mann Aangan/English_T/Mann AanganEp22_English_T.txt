[01:37] What's the price?
[01:39] It's worth 150k rupees.
[01:41] 150k ? OK!
[01:46] Give me 10 minutes please.
[01:48] Sure! Fine.
[01:51] Thank you.
[02:01] Hello Umar!
[02:03] Yes! Everything is fine. What about you?
[02:09] That's good! I actually need some loan.
[02:16] Only 30k!
[02:20] I actually need it urgently! I'll return it to you by next week.
[02:25] I cannot come! Can you please transfer it online?
[02:32] Sure! I'm waiting. Thank you! Goodbye.
[02:44] Sir! Please sit down.
[02:46] I'll wait! Thank you.
[03:12] Received! So now.
[03:16] Kindly pack this!
[03:30] Sir please!
[03:33] Thank you so much!
[03:35] Take care.
[03:40] Darling! It's Rimsha's plan. I suggested that we should arrange a dinner but she wanted to celebrate her birthday.
[03:48] I'm totally fine! Don't worry about me.
[03:52] I do take medicines on time! It's just that when Mahi was here, she used to give me the medicines.Whatever! When will you come tomorrow?
[04:04] Sure! Is Saqlain home? Fine. I'll be waiting for you tomorrow..
[04:18] Mother! What's wrong with Saqlain?
[04:23] What happened? What did he do?
[04:27] We are planning a surprise for sister.
[04:29] Saqlain told me that I should text him the things that I need.
[04:33] Then what?
[04:34] I've messaged him the things but he has still not seen my message! I don't know hat to do now.
[04:40] He'll be busy! I talked to Areeba and she said that Saqlain has still not reached home.
[04:45] But mother, the time is passing and we haven't done any arrangements yet! We didn't order the birthday cake too. What will we do?
[04:55] Tell me! What should I do?
[04:58] Let me call Faraz! He told me that I should call him if there's any help needed.
[05:02] Are you mad? He is my Son in law.
[05:05] He'll feel bad that they are arranging a dinner from me by taking my help. That's not good.
[05:13] What's the big deal? If we can ask Saqlain. Why can't we ask Faraz?
[05:17] Saqlain is not just my son in law! He handles the whole house already like me son.
[05:23] Sure! I can see how well he is handling this house.
[05:27] I think he is ignoring my message on purpose because he knows that I'm planning this surprise for Mahnoor!
[05:34] We should both go to the market and buy the gifts! We'll order the cake and bring someone to decorate the house too. What do you think?
[05:41] No darling! I'm feeling dizzy right now. I won't be helpful at all.
[05:46] Fine! I'll call Faraz. You shouldn't interfere.
[05:51] Do whatever you like.
[05:54] Fine!
[06:06] Hello Rimsha! Have you organized everything?
[06:09] Faraz! There's a little problem.
[06:12] Is everything fine?
[06:14] Yes! Everything is fine but Saqlain is not receiving my calls and you know that I have planned a surprise for sister.
[06:24] I need to do some shopping and also get the arrangement for decor too. I don't know what to do.
[06:30] Why are you getting worried? I'm free! I'm coming to pick you. You can do whatever you want to.
[06:36] I mean that's a great idea! You should come. I'm getting ready!
[06:41] Sure! I'll see you in a bit. Bye!
[06:43] Bye!
[06:47] So Faraz is coming to pick me! He didn't show me any attitude but offered to pick me himself.
[06:56] That's good!
[07:31] What were you doing?
[07:33] Nothing.
[07:35] I needed some money so I took some.
[07:42] Can't you ask me for the money? Why would you steal it? Don't you feel ashamed?
[07:48] I was not stealing it! I would've informed you after taking it.
[07:53] Just like you told me about your scholarship.
[07:59] Why do you need it?
[08:01] You want me to give you the detail about the things I spend money on?
[08:06] Don't tell me.
[08:08] This money is for the expenses of this house! I don't have money for you to waste.
[08:14] Mother! I know that you have the money.
[08:16] You just got your prize bond.
[08:23] You have eyes on my bond too? Don't even think about it. I have saved it for my daughters wedding. You won't get anything out of it.
[08:29] Fine! Almost everything belongs to my siblings.
[08:38] I have no value in this house! Right?
[08:40] Yes! You didn't work on it yourself.
[08:43] You are being unjust with me! You give me some thousand rupees for pocket money.
[08:49] And I also get scolded before getting it.
[08:51] What do you think? That I'm dependent on you? I have many more ways to manage.
[08:59] You don't care about your responsibilities at all.
[09:02] How will you manage? You are managed by your brother.
[09:06] You are right!
[09:12] I hope he didn't take something.
[09:17] He didn't!
[09:18] Thank you so much!
[09:21] Let's go!
[09:22] Faraz!
[09:24] Here.
[09:28] Take this money.
[09:29] Money? Payment has been done.
[09:32] There are many things that we need! Come quick.
[09:34] But mother will mind it.
[09:36] Why?
[09:37] Because mother gave this money for these things.
[09:40] And if she finds out.
[09:42] Fine! tell me about the person for whom we are doing this all for.
[09:47] What's her relation with me?
[09:48] But the party is from our side.
[09:51] So please take this money from me or she'll get mad at me. She scolds me to much.
[09:55] No! It doesn't look good for a brother to take money from his younger sister.
[10:02] You are just like my younger sister. I'll feel happy when I get to know that you actually think of my as your own brother too.
[10:13] Come quick! We have to buy many other things. Lets go.
[10:21] It'll look good.
[10:27] No! Let me ask.
[10:30] Yes! Did you call me?
[10:32] It's good that you are here. A friend of Faraz has invited us to his house. Suggest me that will this dress look good?
[10:40] This is too moderate!
[10:45] I don't like to wear so fancy dresses. I wear moderate clothes.
[10:50] But sister in law, you just got married! This is too moderate. Faraz would like you to wear a fancy suit.
[10:56] Sure! Then I'll chose a heavy dress if Faraz likes it.
[11:04] I don't know where he is! He came late yesterday too.
[11:10] I'll call him.
[11:12] Thank you!
[11:17] Give me the prescription for aunt's medicines! I'll bring them.
[11:22] I don't have the prescription! It's with Saqlain. I told him to bring the medicines.
[11:31] I don't know why would he forget.
[11:33] No worries! bring me the empty packs of her medicines.
[11:41] Yes! I'm bringing them.
[11:48] Faraz! Here's the cake.
[11:50] It's good that you are here! Did you check the cake? It's the one we ordered, right?
[11:55] Yes! I checked.
[11:57] Thats great.
[11:58] This one? Thank you.
[12:01] I'll go and bring the medicines for aunt.
[12:04] Electricity is available too. Complete the decorations by time.
[12:09] Sure!
[12:10] I'll go now.
[12:16] Cake!
[12:21] You should place it in fridge to keep it fresh.
[12:25] I'll place it. What's the hurry about?
[12:26] And Faraz told us to decorate everything timely.
[12:32] We'll do it. If you are insisting, give it.
[12:52] Lets go!
[13:30] Greetings mother.
[13:34] Yes mother! I'm waiting for him.
[13:37] I've called him. He might be busy in office. I don't know if he has already left the office.
[13:44] Yes! I'm getting ready. We'll leave right after he comes home and changes the clothes.
[13:49] Yes! He knows. I talked with him in the afternoon about it.
[13:53] No! I don't know if he has left the office by now. We'll leave as soon as he arrives.
[13:59] Goodbye!
[14:18] Aren't you ready yet?
[14:20] I was waiting for you! Where were you?
[14:24] I had an important thing to do.
[14:28] What about it?
[14:31] I'll tell you! We should get suited.
[14:34] Fine!
[14:38] Mahnoor!
[14:40] Yes!
[14:44] Leave the hair open today!
[14:46] You look lovely when your hair are not tied.
[14:54] Sure!
[16:20] Greetings!
[16:22] Greetings!
[16:24] Please come!
[16:27] If we had to come to my mother's house, why didn't you tell me. You should have told me.
[16:31] It was a surprise!
[16:33] Surprise?
[16:34] Come inside! You'll see everything yourself.
[16:41] Is everything ready?
[16:42] Sure!
[16:43] What is this all about?
[16:45] Come! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!
[16:52] How are you?
[16:53] I'm fine!
[16:55] So this was your plan?
[16:58] Well! You can say that it was us.
[17:05] Happiest birthday to you!
[17:08] May god bless you with a long life.
[17:11] Thank you.
[17:15] So this is why you were busy today.
[17:19] Yes.
[17:21] Mother! Where are Areeba and Saqlain? I can't see them!
[17:24] They are about to arrive.
[17:27] Will they come?
[17:28] Why won't they?
[17:29] I want cut the cake if Areeba doesn't arrive.
[17:31] It won't!
[18:01] Mother! I'm telling you that they won't come. If they had to come, they would have already informed us from yesterday.
[18:07] But nobody contacted us. This clearly means that they have no interest in Mahnoor's birthday.
[18:14] We already know about how much they like Mahnoor.
[18:20] Why would they come?
[18:23] Now get up! Lets go cut the cake.
[18:26] No Rimsha! Areeba told me herself that Saqlain has told her to be ready.
[18:31] They'll be arriving soon.
[18:37] Mother!
[18:41] Why are you guys here? Everybody is waiting for you outside. Is everything fine?
[18:50] Darling! We are waiting for Saqlain and Areeba. They'll be reaching soon.
[18:57] I'm telling you that they won't come.
[19:01] I should have known it before.
[19:03] It so good that I called Faraz and he came so quickly!
[19:09] Faraz is so nice! He took me everywhere himself and paid for everything.
[19:20] You know it very well if he was not there, this dinner would've not been possible for today.
[19:25] Sure! Fine! Lets go! Guests are waiting.
[19:36] What's the wait about?
[19:38] I mean that its getting late! How long will it take for your daughter and son in law to arrive?
[19:44] We have to go back to our home too! We cant stay here the whole night.
[19:48] They might not come.
[19:54] Sister! Let's do one thing. Lets cut the cake.
[19:59] We should wait a little bit more. They might come in a bit.
[20:02] Mahnoor is right! We can wait.
[20:09] Sure! I'll leave for home. Maheer can drop me. You guys enjoy.
[20:16] I'm sorry! I've been sick the whole day.
[20:19] I just came because you invited but I'm feeling ill now.
[20:24] Fine! I can understand. You won't leave without cutting the cake.
[20:34] Mahnoor! This is your gift from mother and my side.
[20:43] This is from my side! Your birthday gift.
[20:48] Thank you!
[20:58] Its so beautiful! 
[21:00] Very pretty and beautiful.
[21:03] Its very beautiful! God bless you.
[21:08] So pretty.
[21:12] Lets cut the cake! Now we should. Please!
[21:18] Come please! Come.
[22:09] Areeba?
[22:10] Greetings!   Greetings!
[22:13] Looks like they have celebrated the birthday already.
[22:20] You were saying that Mahnoor won't cut the cake without you.
[22:26] No Saqlain! We were waiting for you guys.
[22:33] Mother! I called you and said that we'll surely come.
[22:37] Darling! It was getting late so thats why.
[22:45] Who was waiting? Everybody is normal.
[22:49] You guys didn't think of us! Thats why you didn't wait for us.
[22:53] Its nothing like that Saqlain! Please don't mind.
[22:58] If you had picked the call.
[22:59] I told mother that we'll surely come. We were buying a gift for you.
[23:05] He stopped at ten places to buy your favorite flowers.
[23:12]  You! We don't matter to you.
[23:23] No problem! The cakes been cut.
[23:27] We don't need to be here anymore.
[23:41] Happy birthday! You guys should enjoy the party.
[23:45] Saqlain! Saqlain! Saqlain listen please.
[23:48] Saqlain wait! Son wait! Where are you going? At least listen to me.
[23:54] Areeba! A mistake happened. It was a misunderstanding. You know well that I've never cut the cake without you.
[24:07] Its just that you should forget it and forgive me.
[24:14] Forgive her please. She is your younger sister.
[24:22] She'll have a bad mood. Forgive her! Will you gift her a bad mood on her birthday?
[24:30] Aunt was feeling upset too! She's been sick from the morning.
[24:35] She is fine now! Her blood pressure was high. She took the medicines. Now she is fine.
[24:41] If you go back like this, she'll get sick again. She might face the blood pressure problem again too.
[24:47] Forget it! Lets go inside. We've just cut the cake. We have to party yet.
[24:55] Sister!
[24:57] Please don't get mad! I'm feeling hungry. Let all eat together.
[25:02] Please!
[25:06] Come! Come! Please come. Quick!
[25:29] Thank you!
[25:33] For what?
[25:35] Whatever you did today! Specially for the arrangements for today.
[25:42] I did nothing special.
[25:45] Rimsha told me.
[25:47] The party and dinner was arranged by you.
[25:51] No! It was Rimsha's idea and effort.
[25:59] They we you cared for mother. They way you changed the mood of Areeba and Saqlain.
[26:08] They have hurt you already but you still.
[26:14] It's the past Mahnoor! Now the relation has changed.
[26:21] It easy to make a relation but its hard to maintain the relation.
[26:27] And this all is my duty.
[26:33] I just wanted to see you smile!
[27:10] I didn't expect that from Faraz.
[27:15] She married the wife of his choice! Now will he act like that?
[27:22] Maheer was right! That if he marries her, he'll change.
[27:29] How can you judge Faraz like that? Don't believe Maheer. Faraz does so much for us.
[27:37] Who else has cared for us except him.
[27:39] He only cares about his wife. We are a burden to him now.
[27:47] He has million to gift his wife.
[27:52] When I asked him about your dowry. He told me that he doesn't have enough. He could've gifted his wife a moderate gift.
[28:02] He has already spent a lot on the wedding! What was the hurry to go and buy a gift of gold for her?
[28:13] Mother! You didn't like me gifting Mahnoor something special on her birthday?
[28:19] Who gives a gift worth millions on a birthday?
[28:23] When it's not easily possible.
[28:29] You can do everything for her! Its just us that you won't treat special.
[28:43] It's not like that mother.
[28:45] I've always tried to fulfill your demands and I've never left my siblings empty handed.
[28:56] I've never denied your demands.
[29:04] I asked you for some cash for her jewelery.
[29:08] You said that it's too much.
[29:14] Why would you say that son? You should have told the truth that you have to buy a gift for Mahnoor!
[29:21] I wouldn't have stopped you.
[29:27] It's your own money! You can spend them your way.
[29:46] Why are you saying that? You have forgot our relation?
[29:57] Mahnoor is also a part of this house and family.
[30:07] I didn't reject giving the money to you that day.
[30:10] I asked you for some time! I'll give the money to you.
[30:21] Don't worry about the arrangements for Aima's wedding. I'm here ! I'll handle everything.
[30:28] Its my duty! It'll be specially arranged.
[30:40] Trust me! You all are important for me.
[30:52] If its you guys or Mahnoor! You all are important.
[31:06] Brother! Do your breakfast before leaving.
[31:17] At least do it yourself. You are getting late.
[31:19] I have time.
[31:33] Faraz is a nice guy. The things you told about him, I didn't feel like that.
[31:45] You think that I said it myself? You can ask about him yourself from his neighborhood.
[31:55] But I don't think like that.
[31:58] It can be the opposite too.
[32:00] Mother was appreciating him too! She told me that Faraz helped Rimsha a lot in the arrangements for the party. He paid for everything himself.
[32:09] Mother wanted him to take the money but he denied himself.
[32:13] He wanted to show off!
[32:17] What about the money? Mahnoor has a job. He'll take it back from her.
[32:22] He gifted Mahnoor an expensive piece of gold on her birthday.
[32:26] I think he knows Mahnoor.
[32:32] Do you know that aunt transferred 5 million rupees into Mahnoor's account.
[32:37] And property worth 25 million rupees! He just gave her a chain. Why is everyone so happy about it?
[32:44] They can make you fool but not me! I can see everything clearly.
[32:48] I can see how everyone is liking him.
[32:52] I was just saying that...
[32:53] Enough! Don't argue with me.
[32:59] The tea is cold because of your talks.
[33:04] I'll get it microwaved.
[33:06] That'll affect the taste of it.
[33:10] I'll make a new one for you.
[33:11] Thats good! Quickly go and make me a fresh cup of tea. I'm getting late for office.
[33:17] Sure! I'll go make it.
[33:48] Aunt! Why are you doing it? Let me do it.
[33:51] No! I'll do it myself.
[33:57] I'll make the dinner too! I'll cut the vegetables too.
[34:04] Listen! I don't have a problem with you. You are really nice.
[34:18] We've been through a lot of disrespect.
[34:24] We never knew that a girl can break her own home too.
[34:31] For some stranger!
[34:38] if it was about divorce! It would be something else.
[34:43] She blamed us so badly.
[34:48] That we are not able to sit respectfully in front of anyone.
[34:53] Leave the past behind aunt. There are many people in this world. Good and bad.
[35:01] Whoever does bad! They get caught by karma. They can't escape it.
[35:13] You might be right.
[35:20] Darling! You are intelligent.
[35:24] My son Faraz isn't clever! Neither does he have the brain to handle the cleverness.
[35:35] That's why he gets hurt.
[35:42] Faraz was burdened by the responsibilities of this house in a young age.
[35:54] Faraz has seen some bad times. No one ever helped us.
[36:04] Whatever happened! Faraz did everything on his own. His siblings were too young.
[36:13] You are right! Faraz is hard working. He does everything so honestly.
[36:22] Thats why our management of office is happy with him.
[36:30] He'll soon get a promotion too.
[36:34] Yes! Surely!
[36:35] Surely!
[36:38] My son is really hard working.
[36:44] Do tell him that he should think before spending. You see how he didn't tell anyone and got you a gold chain worth millions.
[37:05] I mean that its your right! He should gift you but darling it's too expensive.
[37:18] He should worry about the house expense and his own pocket too.
[37:27] Darling! Place these vegetables in the kitchen! I'll cook the dinner myself. You won't!
[37:34] I'll go pray first.
[37:37] No need to cook! I'll manage the vegetables myself and cook the food too.
[37:42] No darling! They are used to eating the food cooked by me.
[37:48] If they complain about it! You'll feel bad. You can help me.
[37:54] Sure!
[37:58] Listen! If you are free. There are some washed clothes of Faraz in my room. Can you iron them?
[38:09] Please iron my suit too.
[38:13] I'll do it right after I get done with these vegetables.
[38:36] The car is still not here! It's getting late.
[38:57] Hi!
[38:58] Why are you still sitting here?
[39:01] I thought that you would've left.
[39:05] I would've have already left but I'm still waiting for my van. My van hasn't arrived yet.
[39:10] From Home to University and back to home. Is this really your life?
[39:16] Its such a boring life. I mean there's nothing else happening in your life.
[39:23] Don't you get irritated? I mean there's no fun in your life.
[39:32] Well who told you that I'm not interested in fun or excitement?
[39:40] By looking at you and judging the way you talk! I know how boring you are.
[39:46] What have you done in your semester life?
[39:50] You have just completed your assignments and studied.
[39:54] What else should I do?
[39:57] You should not waste your time in copying assignments! I can make them for you too.
[40:06] I think your van is here!
[40:10] Go to your home and enjoy your boring life!
[40:16] Yeah! Yeah! Boring life?!
[40:20] Bye!
