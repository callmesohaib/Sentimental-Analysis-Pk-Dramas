[01:38] Many congratulations!
[01:41] I don't want it
[01:43] You too
[01:45] May God make this relationship blessed
[01:48] Amen!
[01:54] Auntie, tell me what is the next plan?
[01:56] Ashir is leaving in 3 or 4 days. I was thinking what if we do some ritual before he leaves?
[02:03] yes, you are right
[02:05] Wedding would happen once Ashir and Mahi are done with studies
[02:10] what if we do their engagement in two days
[02:13] I'm sorry I'm interrupting
[02:16] I don't believe in engagement
[02:18] I don't believe in wasting my time in these rituals
[02:22] I want us to get married in two days
[02:39] mother
[02:41] umm .. Yes, I don't have an objection
[02:47] Matters are finally resolved
[02:51] You give us wedding date now. Departure would be after they have completed their studies
[03:05] I respect your wish
[03:09] but ..
[03:10] how will we be able to prepare for wedding after 2 days?
[03:14] auntie, you don't have to do anything. You just order us.
[03:17] All the arrangements would be done. I'm here. I'll manage
[03:24] Yes, but I'm telling you. I won't wear old clothes
[03:28] You are worried about yourself?
[03:30] We will take you for shopping. But Mahnoor needs it the most
[03:35] have sweets. We got 2 good news
[04:07] Wasif sir... these sweetmeats
[04:10] Sweet? Is everything okay?
[04:13] Ms. Mahnoor is distributing it. Its her wedding
[04:18] Mahnoor's Wedding!
[04:34] Wasif
[04:41] You had left?
[04:44] Why are you back now?
[04:48] Oh .. may be to see
[04:52] how am I mourning for the loss?
[04:55] please ..
[04:57] you were right Mahnoor
[05:00] No one can give life for anyone
[05:05] look
[05:08] I'm alive .. still
[05:11] words and promise are more important than life
[05:14] Am I not fulfilling my promise?
[05:17] It was you who decided to leave me
[05:19] Please Wasif
[05:21] I think that there is no use of arguing about it
[05:25] will you live happily without me?
[05:29] Happiness of my own people is more important to me
[05:33] Also .. I told you that I don't want to marry right now. Anyways ..
[05:42] These are my personal matters
[05:46] You don't have to do anything with it
[05:49] You are my issue
[05:51] you might not know but you are very important to me
[05:56] I feel that I have lost everything in a moment.
[06:01] I have become a beggar
[06:05] Mahnoor
[06:07] Don't do this to yourself
[06:11] and to me too
[06:13] I was thinking to resign
[06:19] whenever we'll face each other
[06:22] you'd go through the same pain
[06:24] now when our routes are different, I want to them to part properly
[06:33] its just ..
[06:35] I came to say, take care of yourself
[06:48] Mahnoor
[09:17] I want them to part properly
[10:58] Thankfully, everything was done well
[11:03] there were some awkward moments
[11:05] but its okay. It happens
[11:08] I am just satisfied
[11:11] whatever I thought, was fulfilled.
[11:17] Now when you'll be back in 6 months time, I will bring my daughter in law home
[11:24] by the way, can't you extend the leaves? I am not done spending time with you.
[11:29] Also, your in laws have planned many dinners. What do I tell them? You don't have any time
[11:38] Mother, you know that whatever I do is pre-planned.
[11:42] These dinners are just total waste of time.
[11:47] Fine! As you wish
[11:52] Listen, I wanted to ask you to stay in contact with Mahnoor.
[11:56] I will give her number
[11:57] Whats the need of me contacting her?
[12:00] She is your wife now.
[12:02] The more you'll talk the better the understanding would be
[12:07] Mother, I go there for studies. I don't have spare time to do this.
[12:12] I can't afford to divert my focus
[12:15] Also, for God's sake ask them not to have crowd on airport.
[12:19] I'll go the way I used to before
[12:23] Fine, as you wish
[12:26] I have packed your luggage. If there is anything missing, do let me know
[12:30] thank you!
[12:31] okay?
[12:54] Can I have your hand?
[13:10] umm .. by the way sister
[13:13] there is no comparison between both the rings
[13:17] I'm saying that it looks cheap
[13:24] Ramsha, don't talk like this
[13:40] Flight was on time? I asked Saqlain to meet Ashir on airport
[13:48] I hope he reaches safely
[13:51] you do give him my love.
[13:55] Infact, give me his number. I'll talk to him myself
[13:59] Yes! Do let me know when he arrives. Thanks a lot. Bye!
[14:15] umm
[14:16] I was talking to Erum. Ashir is about to reach
[14:23] Where are you going early in the morning?
[14:26] I'll go to office and put my resign
[14:29] Then I'll go to university
[14:33] Bye!
[14:46] Put it on boss's table. Its my resignation letter
[14:51] Can I say something? I hope you won't mind
[14:55] No, what is it?
[14:57] The reason you are leaving, he has already left yesterday
[15:01] I think he has got admission in some university in USA. He was telling this to sir.
[15:06] I think you should stay here and complete your internship.
[15:11] There is no need to go from here.
[17:23] mother? mother, give me food. Where is everyone? I'm too hungry
[17:33] there is no one at home
[17:39] Salma? Where is mother?
[17:41] She is praying
[17:43] Okay! What's in lunch?
[17:46] chicken
[17:47] Please give me food quickly. I'm too hungry. I can't explain.
[17:52] Also, its too hot outside
[17:55] really?
[17:56] yes!
[17:58] but you have cooked chicken. I'm going outside. Bring it quickly
[18:02] Okay!
[18:22] Ramsha, eat slowly. It will stuck in your throat
[18:28] nothing happens. I'm too hungry
[18:31] You haven't even changed your clothes and here you are having lunch? When will you learn manners?
[18:37] what is it? I will change. I'm too hungry
[18:42] you should learn manners. Look at your bag
[18:45] I will pick it up
[18:48] hey Saqlain, you have a long life. I was about to call you. Electricity bill is here
[18:57] who was that guy?
[19:05] I'm asking something
[19:09] Which guy? Whom are you talking about?
[19:11] the one who was following you behind van
[19:14] I told you to stop her.
[19:17] She sits in van but she is mostly hanging outside the window.
[19:20] She was doing the same today
[19:22] I don't know whom are you talking about
[19:27] Am I telling a lie?
[19:28] O no! You can't lie
[19:32] Ramsha, didn't I stop you?
[19:34] I want to know who that guy is?
Since how long is this going on?
[19:40] I don't know
[19:43] auntie, she isn't going to college from tomorrow.
[19:46] I'll call the driver and ask him not to come
[19:49] the drama that is going on will end
[19:53] O no .. Saqlain? Saqlain, listen to me?
[19:57] what did he say?
[20:01] what did I do?
[21:06] enough! enough of crying now
[21:15] why shouldn't I cry?
[21:17] brother Saqlain has put such a big blame on me
[21:21] mother, if a guy is following my van then what's my fault? I didn't ask him
[21:35] what happened? Why is she crying like this?
[21:37] Sister? sister?
[21:42] what is it Ramsha? Tell me?
[21:45] Brother Saqlain said that I won't go to college from tomorrow and forbade me to go
[21:50] why not?
[22:07] tell me one thing, who is brother Saqlain to put these restrictions on us?
[22:12] why is he trying to be a God?
[22:15] instead of scolding her, you are calling him bad? That poor person ..
[22:20] Mother please, stop considering him poor.
[22:23] I won't let him ruin Ramsha's life. She will definitely go to college
[22:30] Mahi .. why do you want to again start a fight with Saqlain.?
[22:35] You know what happened earlier ..
[22:38] I am not interested in fighting with him if he'd stop interfering in our matters.
[22:42] I don't want to fight
[22:45] matter isn't that small, Mahi
[22:49] who ever that guy is. The van crosses that path and comes to our home.
[22:55] People would talk if they'd see something
[23:00] are you scared of people? People do make stories
[23:03] If Ramsha the only girl who goes in that van? 15 or 20 other girls travel daily
[23:09] he might be following some other girl.
[23:12] Also, for example if you are crossing a street and a dog starts barking at you, will you hide inside your house because of that dog?
[23:19] won't you scare it instead?
[23:21] paths can be changed too
[23:23] Stopping Ramsha's studies isn't an option, mother
[23:29] I'm with Ramsha in this matter
[23:32] This is about her future. I won't let anyone to ruin her life.
[23:36] As far as van is concerned, I'll talk to the driver myself.
[23:39] I'll take this responsibility but she will go to college
[23:52] don't you worry
[23:53] you go prepare yourself. You will definitely go to college
[23:58] you took the right decision.
[23:59] I have also asked mother not to send Ramsha alone anywhere
[24:04] you know very well what your sister Mahnoor did
[24:09] huh?
[24:10] then be thankful that it was kept hidden just because of me
[24:14] and she got committed to a good person
[24:15] now Ramsha?
[24:18] what do they want? Do they want to ruin my reputation?
[24:34] Why are you standing here? Aren't you getting late for college? Come quickly and have breakfast.
[24:40] breakfast is ready mother
[24:46] come quickly
[24:50] have breakfast
[25:04] I think your van is here
[25:07] hmm
[25:08] what?
[25:09] its okay. I'll have it later
[25:10] fine! bye
[25:12] bye!
[25:13] bye!
[25:35] I knew that this would be happening here
[25:38] because its hard to listen to me
[25:42] you are wrong.
[25:46] We don't have a problem in listening to you.
[25:49] But I do have a problem with listening to your wrong decisions
[25:53] if you'll keep forcing your decisions on us then we will get hurt.
[25:59] And its obvious that no one tolerates injustice
[26:07] Mahi, be quiet
[26:09] its okay
[26:13] let her speak
[26:15] I want to listen how much poison is filled in her heart for me
[26:19] its not like this
[26:21] it is. This isn't happening for the first time that Mahnoor is objecting my decision.
[26:26] Now she is standing to compete with me as well
[26:28] I am not interested in competing with you nor do I have such intentions.
[26:34] But I won't let you stop Ramsha's studies
[26:38] What do you want to do by putting such restrictions?
[26:40] I want to save her life.
[26:42] These restrictions that you think are unreasonable,
[26:45] God forbid if she starts following your path
[26:53] what do you mean?
[26:56] my path? What have I done brother Saqlain? Speak openly
[27:02] speak openly?
[27:03] You are having an affair with a guy by making your studies and internship and excuse
[27:09] Brother Saqlain, stop putting these blames
[27:13] I don't need to?
[27:16] I have no relation. It is you who is in relationship.
[27:20] God knows what you do with him
[27:22] Now be quiet otherwise..
[27:23] what? Auntie ask both of your daughters to stay in their limits
[27:28] This drama won't take time to reach auntie and Ashir.
[27:32] You know it well that these things spread very quickly and they burn everything
[27:38] I will be insulted only but your dignity will be ruined.
[27:42] Rest is up to you
[27:51] this is why I asked you not to let others take decisions of your family
[27:56] but you didn't listen to me
[28:05] how dare him
[28:11] I don't need to. I have no relation.
[28:15] It is you who is in relationship. God knows what you do with him
[28:34] Mahi?
[28:36] Do you believe what brother Saqlain was saying? Or do you trust me?
[28:41] I did leave the house but I never broke your trust
[28:46] I was friends with Wasif but I never crossed my limits.
[28:50] Then who is he to point fingers at my character?
[28:53] You don't need to say anything Mahi. I trust you completely
[28:57] If you do then why didn't you answer him?
[29:01] no one can be answered that easily. Also Saqlain is...
[29:05] why? why not?
[29:09] anyone comes to our house and character assassinates me and we stay quiet because we are in relationship with him?
[29:16] why can't we answer him and make him stop so that they can't talk like this
[29:23] come my child and sit
[29:30] its easy to say but its difficult to shut people
[29:34] I am scared what if your in laws would come to know about it
[29:40] I don't care if they'd come to know about it. I'm not scared when I haven't done anything
[29:46] Mahnoor, be sensible
[29:49] emotional decisions always hurt us
[29:53] My child, wait for few days and let things get better.
[29:56] I'll talk to Saqlain properly. I'll also ask your sister to talk to Saqlain
[30:02] Sister Areeba is a puppet of him.
[30:05] What would she say? She can't do anything
[30:43] Listen?
[30:46] Mother called
[30:49] Okay? She called to request?
[30:54] No, it isn't like that. She wanted to talk about what you said regarding Mahnoor
[31:01] Do you know I haven't seen more foolish woman in my life than your mother
[31:06] She was complaining about your husband with you
[31:10] it isn't like this
[31:13] mother has never complained about you.
[31:16] And what do you think
[31:18] I would let them do it?
[31:21] then why did she mention Mahnoor matter?
[31:24] what does she want? She wants us to fight?
[31:27] No, she was saying that auntie Erum and Ashir shouldn't find it out
[31:38] hmm? And who would tell them?
[31:43] Look, it was about my family. This is why I got Mahnoor married early.
[31:46] It doesn't take long for someone to blame a girl.
[31:48] And now when I have decided Ramsha to stay home, Mahnoor started fighting with me
[31:55] Mahnoor isn't fighting with you
[31:56] Look, I never wanted to talk to her like this. She forced me
[32:01] That girl is coming after me again and again. Do what you want to do
[32:15] Go and do what you want to do. The world is yours. Go!
[32:17] I'm leaving
[32:50] Ramsha?
[32:55] Ramsha, your phone is ringing. Why aren't you picking it up?
[32:59] I don't want to pick anyone's phone. You do one thing, take this phone and give it to brother Saqlain
[33:06] Do one thing, strangle me and kill me so that you can get rid of me
[33:21] hello?
[33:23] yes my child, Ramsha isn't coming to college today. She is sleeping.
[33:31] She isn't fine. I told you that she won't come to college
[33:42] fine!
[33:46] I was finding you. Sir has given this file and asked to correct the mistakes
[33:52] fine! Farah?
[33:55] yes?
[33:56] Is everything okay at home?
[33:58] yes, everything is fine
[34:01] and how is uncle?
[34:02] father is fine now
[34:05] how is your job going?
[34:07] perfect
[34:10] umm
[34:11] Actually, I was too occupied with work that I forgot. 
[34:16] I remember that you talked about house rent and I told you that my brother in law deals this all
[34:24] We don't live at your house now. Actually, we couldn't afford the rent
[34:30] Your brother in law sent the notice so we vacated quickly
[34:34] you have vacated the house?
[34:36] but brother Saqlain hasn't told anything to us. We don't know anything
[34:43] its obvious, Mahnoor. You are concerned about house rent.
[34:47]  You are getting it on time so why would you care who lives there.
[34:53] umm
[34:53] anyways, its your house. We can't live by force
[35:10] mother, it was father's friend who were the tenants
[35:15] do you know that brother Saqlain asked them to vacate the house. 
[35:18] He sent the notice as well. Do you know this?
[35:23] no, Saqlain didn't mention this. But he did mention the matter of shop
[35:33] I can't explain how much worried they were. 
[35:36] Farha told me. Shouldn't have brother Saqlain discussed it with us at least?
[35:42] yes
[35:44] umm .. mother
[35:46] hmm
[35:47] Is it possible that I handle all the property issues myself
[35:54] yes, why not? You can handle everything. 
[35:59] You are capable of this now
[36:03] now throw Saqlain out and become the boss of this family
[36:07] its obvious, when elders can't fulfill their duty then youngsters have to take responsibility
[36:16] are you listening? Ask her what she really wants?
[36:22] Let things go the way they are going. Let Saqlain handle the house and shop both
[36:31] we are women. We can't run like men
[36:35] That's the problem. We women consider ourselves incapable. 
[36:42] We think that men can do everything.
[36:44]  And because we are women, we can't do anything
[36:47] but mother, I'm not like other women. I'm free from these barriers
[36:55] I don't think that there is anything that men can do but women can't
[37:01] until God is with me, No one can defeat me
[37:17] this girl has lost her mind
[37:21] I will ask you to restrict her at home too, like Ramsha. 
[37:24] Mother, you don't know Ashir. I know him well. 
[37:30] He won't tolerate her attitude
[37:34] He himself is a pampered guy. 
[37:37] Auntie doesn't get tired of spoiling her son
[37:41] If she'd find out that her daughter in law has these thoughts, 
[37:46] she won't like her
[37:49] I'm thinking that its been many days that Ashir left, but he hasn't contacted. 
[37:55] He should have at least contacted Mahi
[37:58] Mother, leave it. 
[38:01] Its better that they both don't talk to each other
[38:06] also, your daughter isn't interested in talking to him
[38:10] it isn't about interest. Its important to talk
[38:14] your daughter is mourning her lost love right now
[38:20] She is fighting with everyone. Leave her alone
[38:25] I will. Tell me, what should I do of Ramsha?
[38:34] Saqlain is very upset right now. He won't listen anything
[38:40] Wait for few days. 
[38:42] As soon as he'd cool down, I'll talk.
