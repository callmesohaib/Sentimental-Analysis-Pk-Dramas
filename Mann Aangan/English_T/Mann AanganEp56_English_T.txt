[02:32] Why was the door locked?
[02:36] Actually I was changing.
[02:59] Are you ready?
[03:02] You go ahead, I'm coming in two minutes.
[05:15] Why is Ramsha not talking to me?
[05:19] If she cannot talk to me. She can at least reply to my message.
[05:49] Yes tell me?
[05:51] Here.. These are your divorce papers.
[05:56] So fast?
Shouldn't I have made them. You only told me to.
[06:05] You are always in a hurry for everything. But oh well, its okay if they're ready.
[06:11] Sir can I ask you something? Do you really want to divorce Areeba?
[06:17] What will I do staying in a relationship with her?
[06:20] If brother Toqeer can take a step, I'll be satisfied. I'll revel in luxuries then.
[06:28] By the way, getting married for the second time isn't wrong. 
[06:32] Do you see how Mr. Touqueer married your sister in law for the second time?
[06:42] I know there's nothing wrong. I made these papers to satisfy Fariya because she wouldn't agree. 
[06:49] That's why I asked you to make the divorce papers on the phone.
[06:53] Otherwise I am in no mood to divorce Areeba just now.
[06:57] I remember, brother Touqeer has asked us something.
[07:02]  He wants to get a shipment cleared. Don't worry about the payment.
[07:08]  Touqeer will pay good.
[07:11] Here is the assignment that needs to be cleared.
[07:15] I'll see.
No don't see. Get it done as fast as possible.
[07:24] It will be done but it will cost you.
[07:28] You're a greedy man. 
[07:32] When did I not pay you?
[07:34] I will take the money from brother Touqeer and give it to you. Don't worry.
[07:37] Sir, I've learnt from the best there are.
[07:45] You will not leave without tea. 
[07:51] Send two cups of teas in.
[07:56] Sir tell me, if you divorce Areeba, what benefit will you get from it?
[08:03] There are a lot of benefits, for you and me.
[08:07] We should just keep our work running.
Of course it will.
[08:14] Thank you.
[08:19] Sir he is my brother in law Maheer. He's a very bright student. A topper.
[08:25]  Please if possible,
[08:29] please get it done before his exams. If he cannot appear for exams his semester will suffer. 
[08:35] yes thank you! Oh Faraz.. Come. sit
[08:39] This production report.
[08:43] I'll see to it but listen to me first.
[08:46] Please look at it first. We cannot delay sending the material.
[08:50] Leave everything. Brother Yasir's interview is done. 
[08:54] The HR called. His interview went good. Hopefully he'll get the job.
[08:59] And I'll find out if I meet Sir Aleem.
Please tell mom.
[09:06] I will tell aunty. 
[09:09] Listen, I talked to a professor I knew for Maheer.
[09:15] He has assured me that he will take Maheer back in certainly.
[09:20] Mahnoor can you recall when was the last time we talked to each other about ourselves?
[09:30] When did we sit together and discussed our problems. 
[09:36] I think not even once in a few months.
Faraz?
[09:42] We only discuss other people's problems and find solutions for them.
[09:48] Its not like that. It isn't. Don't say that.
[09:54] What do we talk about? 
[09:57] We never talk about ourselves.
[10:04] I think we are together because we have to find the solution to the problem of the world.
[10:15] Our problems aren't important.
[10:21] Okay. 
[10:24] Leave everything aside and tell me whats the problem. 
[10:30] We'll discuss that first. What happened?
[10:33] Don't you know what problems we have?
[10:36] Are you saying this because of Wasay?
[10:49] It must be Wasay's call 
[10:53] and you will definitely not like to talk in front of me.
[11:01] I'll wait outside but please see the file. Its important.
[11:07] Faraz.. Listen to me..
[11:24] What is your problem? Why don't you understand? 
[11:28] You created a scene yesterday and now you're calling me.
[11:32] I made a mistake.
[11:34] I shouldn't have come to your office yesterday 
[11:38] but I was concerned.
You don't have to worry about me. You don't.
[11:46] Its because of you that my relationship with Faraz is being spoiled.
[11:50]  You call me again and again. If you want to do something for me. Stop contacting me.
[11:57] Is your relationship so weak with him 
[12:01] that it got affected when I met you. 
[12:04] This means that this relationship is just for the sake of it.
[12:08] Otherwise the person you are rejecting me and my love for. 
[12:15] The person you're fighting with me for, he should be proud of his fate.
[12:21] You chose him. You're complaining I couldn't get you respect in my family. 
[12:28] I was ready to leave them for you.
[12:31] My parents, my wealth. I wanted to kick away everything for you. 
[12:37] Even today I'm waiting for a signal from you.
[12:40] If you want, you can try me.
[13:49] Where did I keep it? Everything is empty here.
[13:53]  It seems Areeba has taken everything. 
[13:57] What is wrong with my memory? I'm so stupid.
[14:04] I forgot where I kept it or did I keep it somewhere else. 
[14:09] Did Areeba find it? 
[14:12] Maybe that's why yesterday she was... No..
[15:09] What is wrong Mr. Faraz? Are you feeling alright?
[15:13] Yes I'm fine.
[15:15] Maybe you've been scolded by miss Mahnoor. That's why you're so worried. 
[15:21] We have to agree. Ever since Mahnoor is back from her leaves, she has become aggressive.
[15:28] She keeps on scolding everyone even on the tiniest things. 
[15:33] But what can we do? She's our boss.
[16:24] Areeba, I was dusting and found Saqlain sir's file. Where should I keep it?
[16:30] Keep it in my room.
[16:32] Listen, don't touch it.
[16:36] Are you alright, mam Areeba?
[16:39] I don't know I have a headache and I'm feeling anxious.
[16:45] May God keep everything alright. If you say, should I call Mahnoor?
[16:51] Why? Why will you call Mahnoor? Is she a doctor? Go and do your work.
[17:01] I am tensed because of Mahnoor and Ramsha. 
[17:08] Both of them get me insulted by my husband every other day.
[17:15] Go and keep the file in the room.
Alright.
[18:03] Areeba I'm busy in the office and I might have to go to Hyderabad. 
[18:07] If I don't come home, don't wait up.
[18:13] Did you tell her?
Yes. I told her that I won't come home.
[18:19] But you didn't tell her that you're staying with me.
[18:22] Its not needed.
[18:25]  I'm here to make you happy. Tell me whats the plan? 
[18:29] You want to go have dinner?
[18:32] Of course we will have dinner but I want to shop as well.
[18:35] Go ahead and shop. When did I say no to you?
[18:38] But you will not say that you have no money.
[18:41] I will always have money for you. 
[18:45] Now you don't have to get ready, I like you as you are.
[18:48] Alright. Fine.
Come.
[19:52] Areeba I'm busy in the office and I might have to go to Hyderabad.
[19:57]  If I don't come home, don't wait up.
[20:09] Listen, I'm not feeling well. 
[20:13] Please don't go today.
[21:10] Thank God a million. I am hearing two good news in one day.
[21:15]  Yasir's job and a hope for Maheer's readmission in his university.
[21:21] You should ask Maheer to prepare for his exams. 
[21:23] He will have to join the university in a few days. His interview was very good.
[21:29] As God wills. Did you hear?
[21:33] Mahnoor has stopped your year from being wasted. Thank her.
[21:37] There's no need. I just want,
[21:42] Maheer to focus on his studies.
[21:49] He will focus. He will definitely study. 
[21:54] He has no responsibilities. He will complete his studies and support his brother.
[22:08] My dear. Maheer. Whatever is done is done. And dear,
[22:18] focus on yourself. Groom yourself. See what you have done to yourself.
[22:22] What have I done? I'm fine.
[22:27] How are you fine? You used to take care of yourself. Do now as well.
[22:32] Earlier it was different and now its different.
[22:37] Do you want me to be like I was before? That me caused so much pain.
[22:46] You had to bear so much disrespect because of me and Ramsha..
[22:53] Her whole life has been destroyed.
[22:59] My dear. This is how God must have decided for you. 
[23:06] But dear, move on. This is life.
[23:13] Get a grip on yourself.
Alright.
[23:27] Thank God. We finally have good news in this house too.
[24:22] Did you like anything?
[24:25] I already have so much jewelry at home. 
[24:30] Why do we need all this?
[24:32] We need it because girls should have more jewelry but not less.
[24:44] I like this and this and this. You tell me what you like so we'll buy something.
[24:51] But you should choose something.
[24:58] We're not here for me. We're here for you. Chose something so that we can buy...
[25:13] My choice and happiness has no importance. 
[25:16] When I cannot spend my life as I wish, why should I buy all this jewelry? 
[25:22] What will I do with it?
[26:17] Faraz.. Faraz what is wrong with you? Why are you not talking to me?
[26:27] What should I say to you?
[26:29] You're asking me what you should say to me? 
[26:33] You haven't talked to me for the past two days.
[26:37]  Are you upset with me?
[26:41] Just because Wasay came to meet me.
[26:48] No. 
[26:51] There is nothing to be upset about it.
[26:54] Then? Whats the problem then?
[26:57] There is no problem.
You don't trust me.
[27:04] Do you think Wasay came to meet me and he and I.. 
[27:10] Wasay and I have nothing between us.
[27:16] But then how did he come to the office to meet you?
[27:18] I don't know. I don't even know who gave him the address.
[27:25]  I just saw him after I gave my exam.
[27:31] And I just..
[27:36] You have your exam tomorrow? What time?
In the morning.
[27:40] So should I drop you?
[27:43] No. You should go to the office and work. There is so much work.
[27:48] I will go myself. My car is at home only.
[27:55] That's why you stopped me from dropping you. 
[27:59] You say you don't trust me but you're the one with trust issues.
No..
[28:12] You met Wasay and talked to him. This means you might have connected with him on the phone.
[28:25] You didn't share with me.
[28:28] Faraz because..
Because you don't trust me.
[28:31] No. Its not that. I didn't tell you because of another reason.
[28:40] Mahnoor I have always loved and honored everyone in my life. I sacrificed myself.
[28:52] I neglected myself. 
[28:57] But trust me I have never gotten back anything in return. Nothing.
[29:10] I have never gotten anything. Ever.
[30:09] Is your shopping complete now?
Almost.
[30:13] Thank God.
[30:15] I made you spend so much today. 
[30:19] But as it is you brought me shopping after a long time today. Specially for jewelry.
[30:27] Thank you.
[30:29] Just remind me. I keep forgetting because I'm busy. 
[30:34] I haven't been able to recall a few things.
[30:36] What can't you recall?
[30:38] I kept something somewhere and I can't remember where.
[31:44] I'm hungry. Lets eat something. Excuse me, can we have the menu please.
[32:07] What happened Ramsha? Did you see someone?
[32:11] I saw brother Saqlain with some girl.
[32:21] Do you want to meet him? Its not a good place. 
[32:26] Malls aren't a place for family reunions. 
[32:31] What are you thinking? lets go
[32:43] Who was that girl with brother Saqlain? and they were holding hands & were so close to each other
[32:50] I should tell Areeba about it. 
[32:53] And it would have been good if I had confronted brother Saqlain. Everybody would know about his real face.
[33:03] He insulted me and sister Mahnoor when he is doing this himself.
[33:17] What was the use?
[33:20]  Bringing you here and shopping? What benefit did all my efforts get?
[33:27] You are still upset. 
[33:30] You're still in the same mood that you left the house in. 
[33:34] actually... 
[33:35] To be honest it seems I'm wasting my time with you.
[33:45] Whatever I do, nothing makes you happy. 
[33:50] What should we do that will put you in a better mood?
[33:54] You are always upset. 
[34:00] And frankly, I think I should stop making any efforts with you.
[34:13] Bring the bill please.
[34:18] Sorry.
[35:36] I'm hungry. We should eat. Excuse me, can we have the menu please.
[35:46] What should we do that will put you in a better mood? 
[35:49] You're always in a bad mood. And frankly,
[35:58] it seems I should stop making any efforts with you.
[36:42] Sister in law..
What happened?
[36:47] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[36:51] Its okay.
[36:55] Are you still upset with me?
[36:59]  I know its not easy to forgive whatever I did..
[37:05] But I never thought whatever I was doing would result in such bad consequences.
[37:10] You should have thought. 
[37:13] But now take this as a lesson for the future.
[37:20] Don't ever do such a thing with anyone again. Don't joke with anybody's life. 
[37:27] Nothing happened with you. I saved you.
[37:31] But poor Ramsha..
Ramsha. How is she?
[37:36] You shouldn't have worried about her. She's fine wherever she is
[37:44] You have already created problems for her.
[37:48] I don't want her to get hurt anymore because of you. 
[37:52] Please Maheer, stay away from her.
[37:58] Yes.
[38:02] Had it been so easy to listen to you, I wouldn't have been crying. 
[38:07] I'm amazed why am I obsessed with Ramsha?
[38:15] Why can't I forget her? Why am I pining to hear her? But she isn't talking to me at all.
[38:46] Are you alright?
Yes.
[38:52] what will happen to me?
[38:55] Why do you look so upset? It seems you have been crying.
[39:01] Crying has been written in my fate.
[39:08] Why are you saying this? Did you argue with brother Saqlain? Is there a problem?
[39:16] No.
[39:19] Does Areeba know about brother Saqlain and..
What about brother Saqlain?
[39:28] I saw him with a girl in the mall. She looked as if she was pretty young. Around 22-23.
