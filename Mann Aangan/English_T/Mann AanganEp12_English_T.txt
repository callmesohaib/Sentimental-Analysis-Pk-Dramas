[00:54] Sister, stop mother.
[00:58] She asked auntie to find a proposal for me. I can't marry right now. Please, talk to mother
[01:09] What do I say?
[01:13] She won't agree.
[01:15] She has said it that she doesn't trust me.
[01:22] What would I say to her?
[01:27] this is all happening because of you.
[01:30] You have set an example that mother doesn't trust me now.
[01:35] It was you who used to have affairs outside with men.
[01:40] I used to come straight home from college
[01:46] Instead of you, if I had talked about it to mother or brother Saqlain
[01:50] then I would have already gotten rid of that disgusting man.
[01:54] Ramsha?
[01:56] The whole neighborhood is joining my name with that disgusting man, and comparing me with you.
[02:04] My life is over.
[02:07] I want to study not marry. What will I do now?
[02:27] It was you who used to have affairs outside with men.
[02:31] I used to come straight home from college.
[02:45] Come in
[03:15] Mother, you were saying that some guests would come today for brother Faraz's proposal, but you haven't prepared anything.
[03:22] Neither have you cleaned the house or changed clothes.
[03:26] I myself stopped them.
[03:31] Infact, I told her not to show us any proposal for sometime now.
[03:38] We will solve this matter later
[03:40] Why mother, you were after auntie to solve this matter as soon as possible.
[03:46] What happened now?
[03:48] Aima, I think Maheer was right.
[03:52] Earlier, I took the decision in rush and foolishness and got Faraz married.
[04:01] I was scared that he earns well and is settled, he might bring someone from his choice
[04:10] who would corner us all.
[04:18] she didn't gave importance to Faraz as well
[04:25] It isn't right to get him married at this time.
[04:39] What if I get him married in this condition and his bride would start controlling his money, then?
[04:48] So mother, does it mean that you won't get brother Faraz married?
[04:52] Its unjust
[04:54] This isn't. Faraz knows it well that he isn't going to get married easily. Also, he refuses himself.
[05:07] I don't have a husband who would take responsibility of this house.
[05:14] I have this son whom I made this capable of
[05:19] Now he should fulfill the responsibilities he has first. After that I'll get him married
[05:28] Until then Maheer would become something
[05:36] As you wish. If you find it appropriate, then do it
[05:44] Listen, check this and clean it properly. I'll go and pray. I'll come back and cook it
[05:59] Come in
[06:04] Madam?
[06:05] Yes?
[06:07] Did you sign this quotation?
[06:11] Yes, shouldn't have I?
[06:16] No! I think you didn't give it a thorough read.
[06:21] Prices mentioned are too high and we didn't do contract on these rates
[06:26] What do you mean?
[06:28] I mean, if we'll do the project on this price, then it would cost us double.
[06:34] Show me?
[06:41] Absolutely! These are the wrong prices. They aren't those we decided in the meeting
[06:48] Yes! You might have not noticed another thing on it.
[06:52] You got this file directly, and it doesn't have my sign on it. You still gave the approval
[07:02] I think you are disturbed mentally
[07:06] It is Bilal who is at mistake.
[07:09] He took out wrong rate list and sent to you directly by the office boy.
[07:15] I'll do one thing, I'll cancel it. So that you won't have a problem later
[07:26] Thank you Faraz!
[07:28] Mention not, madam.
[07:51] Mother has called us tomorrow evening
[07:54] Is everything fine?
[07:55] Auntie Najma has shown a proposal for Ramsha
[07:59] The guy lives outside the country. He has a good business and nice family.
[08:06] He is 7 or 8 years older than Ramsha.
[08:10] Mother want you to look into this proposal. Say yes if you find it right
[08:17] Does it mean that auntie wants to get Ramsha married before Mahnoor?
[08:24] What Mahnoor did to herself
[08:28] would effect Ramsha's future too
[08:31] Its better that Ramsha get married before that
[08:35] Tell me, what unjust has happened to Mahnoor?
[08:38] She has been living her life freely. Doing whatever she wants
[08:46] She meets whoever she wants to
[08:50] It is us who are facing this humiliation.
[08:54] And along with us, that poor Ramsha is also suffering because of her.
[09:03] Ramsha called. She was crying a lot.
[09:08] She was asking me to stop mother. She doesn't want to get married but study.
[09:15] I clearly told her that I'm not going to do so.
[09:19] I also want her to get married so that mother can be over with this responsibility
[09:27] Because I think that it is difficult to explain anything to Mahnoor now
[09:35] I think this would be appropriate according to situation
[09:54] These are few bills that I have already looked into. Some of these are important ..
[10:22] Madam?
[10:24] Yes? You were saying ..
[10:27] You weren't listening to what I was saying
[10:32] I have been seeing since few days that you look very distracted.
[10:35] You seem stressed. Is there any problem?
[10:43] I'm so sorry. I'm asking you a personal question
[10:46] No, you're right. I'm too stressed these days.
[10:52] I'm sure, its work pressure
[10:55] No! It's something personal. Anyways thanks for your concern.
[11:01] but I think I need to learn things from you
[11:05] that how can be keep our personal and professional life separate
[11:11] and how can we prioritize work besides having crisis in our personal life.
[11:21] A person learns this over time.
[11:24] Everyone is facing problems and troubles in their lives these days
[11:33] And if we don't focus on our job besides having these problems, then we might lose our job.
[11:39] That would be a new problem.
[11:43] Its better if we stay focused on our work
[11:48] you are right. Also, I have to prove it to the management that selecting me wasn't a bad decision.
[11:55] I am still on my probation period and I have to show them that their decision of choosing me was right.
[12:06] Good luck!
[12:08] Thank you! What were you saying?
[12:10] yes!
[12:18] auntie, I know that you took this decision in grief
[12:24] but what can we do? A person thinks something but something else happens
[12:34] Don't you worry. Things will be fine and this time will pass
[12:43] by the way, where is Ramsha? I am here since long and she hasn't come to meet me
[12:50] yes, she's in room. I'll call her. Salma?
[12:56] yes?
[12:56] Tell Ramsha that brother Saqlain is outside. So she comes out
[13:00] yes madam
[13:03] How is Areeba? You should have brought her along
[13:07] She was busy at home
[13:34] Sister Ramsha, madam is calling you outside.
[13:38] Brother Saqlain is there too. He's asking about you
[13:40] So what if he's here. I don't want to meet anyone. Everyone should go to hell
[13:47] Sister, speak slowly. There would be a new problem if brother Saqlain has heard you.
[13:52] You go outside and greet him. Then come back
[13:57] Fine! you go, I'm coming
[14:05] meet brother Saqlain
[14:25] Greetings!
[14:27] Greetings!
[14:31] What is it? I have been sitting here since long and you haven't come to meet.
[14:36] What is my fault in it if you are upset with auntie?
[14:45] what have you done to you? You have ruined your eyes crying.
[14:50] Has crying ever solved a problem?
[14:52] Brother Saqlain, ask mother not to be unfair to me by making an issue out of that thing.
[14:58] I don't know that guy, I swear. I don't know what is happening to me.
[15:04] fine! sit, my child
[15:14] I know my child that it wasn't your fault.
[15:17] That nuisance was after you.
[15:20] I have taught him a lesson that he will remember it his whole life.
[15:24] You won't see him ever again in this street.
[15:26] If you'd face him in life later, it would be him who'd change the path
[15:37] And auntie, don't you worry too. I have handled the situation well. Everything is fine, don't worry
[15:51] By the way, do you know I have something that would change your mood immediately. And you'll stop crying
[16:07] what is this?
[16:08] Look at it yourself
[16:21] this is .. this is my college fee
[16:26] yes! I have got your admission done.
[16:31] Now study hard. You have already wasted a week of yours
[16:39] But my child Saqlain, I don't want her to study further.
[16:44] I want to get her married as soon as possible
[16:52] auntie, don't mind. Decisions taken in rush are always wrong
[16:58] also, Ramsha is still young. It isn't her age of marriage
[17:03] she should study
[17:05] You have no idea how much I disliked it hearing about it from Areeba.
[17:12] And trust, when her age would come I would get her married myself with a suitable guy.
[17:18] Its my responsibility not yours.
[17:27] Do one thing
[17:35] Do one thing, keep this money. Have it. Shop for yourself tomorrow and study hard.
[17:46] Thank you!
[17:52] Auntie, I'll leave now. I'll visit with Areeba after 1 day or two.
[17:56] Infact, I'll ask Areeba to take you out for shopping
[18:01] That would be fine
[18:04] Fine! Are we happy?
[18:07] hmm
[18:08] Right?
[18:10] Stay happy. Okay auntie, bye!
[18:13] bye!
[18:24] Brother Saqlain? Brother Saqlain?
[18:29] Yes my child?
[18:31] I wanted to say thank you! You have no idea how much I'm thankful to you.
[18:38] Mother wasn't ready to listen to me or anyone else
[18:42] My child, there is nothing to be thankful. This was my responsibility.
[18:46] I will keep fulfilling my responsibility in future too.
[18:50] I know that auntie said those words in anger. She did injustice. She shouldn't have
[18:57] But I promise. Nothing would happen to you until I'm here.
[19:02] Relax!
[19:07] O Mahnoor?
[19:14] Greetings!
[19:15] Greetings! You are back early today. Its not even 6
[19:20] When I get free early or there is no work at office, I try to come back home early
[19:27] hmm...
[19:29] Mahnoor, I know it that you don't like anyone's interference in your personal affairs, but ..
[19:35] It isn't like this. Tell me what you want to say?
[19:41] There are some issues that are connected to family
[19:45] and they directly effect your family.
[19:49] Relatives and neighbors have started talking about it too now.
[19:54] Why don't you get a car for you?
[19:57] It isn't appropriate to take a lift from your colleague
[20:01] Look, I'm not saying it for me but for you.
[20:05] You are at a higher position in your office.
[20:10] It doesn't look good taking pick and drop from your colleague.
[20:14] People say things when you leave. One should be careful
[20:21] no matter how liberal we are, we have to live in this society
[20:26] Yes!
[20:29] Okay then, bye
[20:31] bye!
[20:39] Lets go!
[21:16] I used to consider brother Saqlain so wrong.
[21:20] I have always made fun of him and insulted him thinking that he only thinks wrong about us. He keeps scolding us
[21:29] But he has proven me wrong today
[21:33] If a medicine is bitter, it doesn't mean that its bad.
[21:39] Saqlain has always cared about us.
[21:43] He isn't my child but he has proven himself my son
[21:50] He always cared about my pain more than my real children
[21:59] How is it?
[22:00] Delicious. I was very hungry
[22:02] good!
[22:13] Brother, I need a bike to come and go to university
[22:20] Bike?
[22:22] Yes,
[22:24] Actually, university is far away. I have to change van every time.
[22:29] I get tired too. Above all, my clothes get dirty and it doesn't look good
[22:36] Why don't you do one thing, you get free from university in the evening.
[22:40] Give tuition to children. Save that money and get a bike on installments. Right?
[22:49] Don't you speak too much?
[22:51] Keep your ideas to yourself. Also, when will I study if I'll go teach?
[23:01] As if you study after university in the evening and don't roam around with friends?
[23:08] Aima, have your breakfast quietly
[23:18] Yes, Ramsha has got the admission.
[23:20] Now brother Saqlain would decide her pick and drop.
[23:27] Listen, I considered brother Saqlain wrong. I misunderstood him
[23:32] He has always solved our problems in a very positive way.
[23:38] The issue that got worse because of me and Ramsha was suffering, he solved that too.
[23:45] Otherwise, poor Ramsha
[23:48] I was disturbed so I wasn't able to work properly too.
[23:56] But now I have thought that I would forget everything and work hard
[24:04] Now there is no problem regarding brother Saqlain as well. I'm satisfied
[24:11] Yes! Okay Aneeqa, bye
[24:24] Faraz my child ..
[24:26] He's too worried since few days and requesting me to ask brother to get him a bike
[24:39] My child, if possible then manage it and get him a bike on installments
[24:47] Mother, don't you know how difficult would it be to pay installments?
[24:53] Already, loan is being deducted from my salary
[24:57] and I have to pay his semester fee too
[25:04] I can't take loan again and again.
[25:08] Neither would my company approve loan so easily
[25:15] Yes my child, I do understand.
[25:18] There are many problems but the income is less.
[25:23] Our problems are more than your strength
[25:27] what are you saying? Are your problems different than mine?
[25:36] Infact, I'm worried that my siblings are facing such problems that I'm not able to solve
[25:58] Fine, we'll get a bike for you
[26:06] thank you brother!
[26:08] For now, lets get a second hand bike. We will get a new one later
[26:18] Live long my child. May God keep you happy and may He keeps giving you strength
[26:27] How much you care and love your siblings.
[26:33] Do you know, you aren't like your paternal family regarding this
[26:38] Look at your uncle.
[26:41] The way he has taken right of your father.
[26:45] God knows how do these people sleep in peace?
[27:10] Did you talk to Mahnoor about that guy?
[27:14] The guy who is her colleague and neighbors saw her with him too
[27:20] After so much, do you really think I'll talk to Mahnoor? Never
[27:28] Areeba, you should at least talk to her
[27:34] Mother has stopped talking to Mahnoor as well
[27:38] It is you who got Ramsha admitted in university.
[27:43] Otherwise, I didn't want Ramsha to go to university
[27:48] She's becoming ill-mannered like Mahnoor
[27:51] Look I don't want you to be disheartened by your sisters.
[27:55] They are your blood. Don't fight with them because of me
[28:01] Yes, they are my sisters. But they don't care about me at all.
[28:10] Only you are mine. 
[28:13] You always supported me in grief
[28:17] Because of my sisters, you were humiliated a lot. You tolerated everything silently
[28:33] For me, your happiness is most important.
[28:37]  I don't have anyone in this world but you
[28:43] and we will tolerate all these problems
[28:51] Tell me yourself, can you leave me alone in my happiness? No, right? Then how can I?
[29:02] you kept facing my sister's problems because of me
[29:11] they are my sisters too
[29:17] Coat
[29:19] Yes!
[29:31] Do talk to her. Okay? Bye
[29:38] bye!
[30:14] For how long will you stay upset to me?
[30:19] I'll leave this job and stay home, would that make you trust me?
[30:27] Who was the guy neighbors saw you with?
[30:33] He's my colleague, mother. Assistant manager.
[30:37] Are you related to him?
[30:38] Mother please, what are you saying?
[30:41] My cab stopped working so he helped me. 
[30:48] I was dropped at bus stop and not home just to avoid any such issue
[30:56] Still .. please trust me
[31:01] Do I need to convince you as well? 
[31:05] To win your trust, do I need to make promises?
[31:10] Please, try to understand me
[31:17] why are you standing with the world?
[31:21]  Is the world not enough to hurt me that you are supporting them?
[31:29] you know me. I'm not like this
[31:36] Come to me
[33:24] I have got the file. I'll talk to you later.
[33:29]  Yes Ms. Mahnoor, your work and dedication has proven it that our decision of selecting your wasn't wrong. I appreciate it
[33:39] Along with this, I want to give you this good news that your job is permanent now. 
[33:43] Now you'd be able to get all the perks like car, provident fund, insurance etc
[33:51] Thank you so much sir. This is the result of your trust on my and co operation of my team.
[33:57] otherwise, I won't be able to reach this position
[34:00] Sign of hard working people is that they don't find anything difficult. 
[34:06] Tell me one thing. do you know driving?
[34:10] umm .. I don't know it yet, but I'll learn
[34:14] You'll get the car in 2 to 4 days.
[34:17] I want you to be ready for that
[34:19] Sure sir! Thank you
[34:19] Thank you!
[34:29] so funny!
[34:40] Ramsha?
[34:41] hmm?
[34:42] How is your university going?
[34:46] Its going good
[34:47] Hmm .. you might have found new friends in university now
[34:55] Yes, I have made many friends
[34:58] You haven't told me about your friends. Tell me? How are they and who are they?
[35:05] Why don't you ask clearly that have I made male friends or not?
[35:12] No, it isn't like that. 
[35:16] Look, you study in a university. 
[35:19] If you make male friends , there is no problem in it. Its just that we should know our limits
[35:27] Look Ramsha, You are my younger sister. This is why I'm explaining it to you. 
[35:32] I have been noticing that you focus more on phone than studies these days
[35:39] This time of university is very excited but challenging too
[35:47] I know that you are a bright student. 
[35:52] This is why I don't want you to suffer in studies in any way
[36:01] are you understanding?
[36:03] You aren't present at home the whole day. 
[36:05] You have no idea what is going on behind you. How can you say that I don't study the whole day?
[36:11] It isn't like that. I didn't mean that
[36:14] You mean I should stay busy studying just for you?
[36:17] No ..
[36:18] Secondly, I'm not interested in friendship with guys. 
[36:24] And I know my limits more than you.
[36:28] So its better if you don't dictate me for no reason. huh?
[36:35] Ramsha?
[36:35] Move aside
[37:18] Yes?
[37:20] Greetings!
[37:22] Is this Ms. Mahnoor's house?
[37:24] It is, And you?
[37:27] My name is Faraz. I and Ms. Mahnoor work in the same office.
[37:30] Okay!
[37:33] Mr. Faraz, you?
[37:36] Yes, your car is here. GM asked me to drop it at your house.
[37:41] I asked GM to ask the driver to drop the car at home
[37:45] His driver is on leave
[37:49] Thank you!
[37:50] You're welcome. Congratulations to you. You deserve this achievement.
[37:58] So kind of you. Thank you!
[38:00] I'll leave now
[38:02] No way! Mahnoor, he did so much effort for you. At least ask him to come inside for tea
[38:10] No, it isn't needed. I have to hire a cab and get my car. I will get late
[38:19] Right!
[38:21] The key .. bye
[38:29] Congratulations! You should learn to drive now. 
[38:33] Infact, if you have any problem, ask your colleague to take time out and teach you driving.
