[01:17] You have a lion's heart, my son.
[01:19] There is no limit to your strength. You're still with her barren daughter.
[01:28] Auntie Irham often asks me to marry. 
[01:35] It isn't your fault that we don't have a child.
[02:31] Hello...
[02:36] I'm fine as well.
[02:41] I visited the specialist you asked me to go to. But it seemed that they had no interest in my case.
[02:51] If you have another specialist, then sent me their number.
[02:58] Thank you. Yes, Saqlain is fine as well.
[03:04] Mother is fine as well. She was unwell a few days ago.
[03:10] Alright, take care. I'll be waiting, send me the number.
[03:18] Farewell.
[03:36] It seems to me that we are wasting our time.
[03:40] Saqlain will not come under our control. Even though he's troubled by his wife, he will not leave her.
[03:48] Till now you've been going according to yourself. If you had listened to me, then the tables would have surely turned.
[03:57] If I had listened to you, he would have run away by now.
He'll run away after he uses you.
[04:06] You'll be removed from his heart and his love for you will wear off. That would have happened by now if I wasn't here.
[04:19] But now I'm not willing to take any risks. You'll do as I say...
[04:25] then you'll see, he'll beg you to marry him.
[04:36] Maybe Saqlain is here.
Go to your room and don't come outside. I don't even want to hear your voice.
[04:55] Sit down, son.
[04:58] Where is Fariya?
She went away with his uncle, who had just come from Nawabshah.
[05:05] But you told me that they had disowned you. You told me that he took over everything and ousted you after your husband died.
[05:13] Yes, my dear... greed can make one cruel...
[05:19] He was blinded by that.
[05:23] But now he has realized his mistake. He came here and apologized to me and Fariya.
[05:33] And then he took Fariya with her.
How can Fariya leave without my permission?
[05:40] We didn't get the chance to tell you. You don't know how he is...
[05:46] He's very stubborn. He's decision is set in stone. He asked me to go with him as well.
[05:54] But I stayed because I wanted to give you the keys to this house and thank you.
[06:01] How dare you sent away Fariya without asking my permission?
[06:05] I'm her mother, what are you saying? And he's her uncle, I don't need your permission to take any decision.
[06:14] So you've forgotten all of my favors.
[06:19] I remember all of your favors, and we will remember them for the rest of our lives.
[06:26] Don't say such foolish things and ask her to come back.
She can't come back here.
[06:32] Why not?
[06:34] It's because her uncle has decided to make her his daughter-in-law.
[06:41] The respect that he's giving her, you can't do that.
[06:46] I'm her mother, I can't destroy her future.
[07:11] What did you say to him? He has left!
[07:17] He'll come back and this time he'll be back with a cleric.
[07:23] He's calling me.
Don't you dare pick it up?
[07:33] Do as I say, understand?
[08:31] How come you're here so out of the blue? Why didn't mother come with you?
Can't I visit you out of the blue?
[08:40] I didn't mean to say that...
Don't worry, I took permission from my mother and notified her that I was there.
[08:50] Alright fine, did you eat anything?
I'm coming here straight from the university.
[08:57] I am hungry.
No worries, I'll arrange something for you to eat.
[09:06] I don't see auntie and brother Faraz anywhere.
Auntie is in the kitchen and brother Faraz is in our room.
[09:13] And Mahir?
[09:16] He still hasn't come back from university?
When does he come back?
[09:22] There's no telling. Sometimes he comes at three, sometimes at four... and sometimes at five.
[09:28] There is no timetable fixed for him. Are you taking care of mother?
I do, as much as I can. Now, give me something to eat.
[09:39] Sit down. I'll do something.
[09:48] Come here.
[09:55] What's the matter?
Why is Mahnoor's sister here unannounced?
[10:02] It's obvious, it's sister's home. She can come here anytime she wants.
One can't just visit one's sister's in-laws, whenever they feel like it.
[10:15] If I had known I would have made something good for dinner.
[10:19] What should I do?
[10:22] I'll ask Faraz to order something.
[10:27] If she eats vegetables for dinner, she'll go and tell her mother. She'll say that we weren't hospitable to her.
[10:33] There are some kebabs in the freezer, fry them for her.
[10:39] Mother, they are not like that, why are you worrying? I'll fry those kebabs.
[10:53] Brother Faraz, the entire event yesterday was successful only because of you.
[10:58] And I came here to thank you. I can't tell you how happy I am.
[11:06] Yesterday was Mahnoor's day and nothing could have been greater than that. If you guys constantly thank me and make me feel like a stranger...
[11:18] No brother Faraz, it's not like that.
Think of me as your brother, as I think of you as my sister.
[11:29] Apart from that, if you ever need my help with anything you can ask me.
[11:38] Okay, I should get going now.
At least eat something before you leave.
[11:44] Have something to eat, then we'll drop you off and Mahnoor will meet her mother as well.
[11:50] Right?
Sure, come on.
[12:07] Thank you.
Greetings*
[12:13] Will you have tea?
Sure.
[12:17] How come you're here today? Everything alright?
[12:23] I decided that you would come here after university, so I decided to meet you here.
[12:31] You know how adventurous my life is... it's not boring like yours.
[12:41] By the way, did you come here to meet me?
I want you to help me in my regular life, as you do in university.
[12:52] What does that mean?
[12:54] Make my life adventurous like yours.
[13:01] Okay.
[13:04] Mahir...
Yes, brother?
[13:07] You were quite late today.
[13:14] Yes, I had some extra classes. After the class, I sat down and discussed it with my friends and I lost track of time.
[13:24] Really... we were going to drop off Ramsha home. It's getting late...
[13:31] Okay...
But Ramsha, first eat something.
[13:34] No, she's done. You've eaten, right?
[13:39] Let's go...
Let's go...
[16:35] After Faraz parks the car he'll come inside and meet mother.
Thank God you're here, I was about to call you.
[16:43] Why are you so worried? Is mother alright?
Miss Sairah is not well. Check-in on her.
[16:51] I think her blood pressure must have fallen.
I don't trust the medicine the doctor gave her.
[16:59] I think we should take her to the doctor again.
[17:16] Mother...
What happened to you?
[17:21] Hey... Mahi, it's you!
What happened to you...
[17:26] Nothing my dear... I just felt a little down.
Were you taking your medicine?
[17:35] Yes...
[17:38] I've taken my medicine, don't worry...
[17:42] I'll take care of it. Ramsha, call brother Saqlain and ask him to book an appointment for mother with the doctor.
[17:49] Sister... it was getting hard for mother to breathe as well.
What?
[18:03] She has a breathing problem as well?
No... she only has blood pressure issues and for that she takes medicine.
[18:11] This is the first time she is having issues breathing.
[18:16] Yes... let's take her to the doctor.
My dear, you are worrying for no reason.
[18:23] I'm fine... you'll go to the doctor for no reason.
[18:29] Don't worry about me.
Faraz is right. We'll take you to the doctor.
[18:36] Saqlain will take me tomorrow. Why are you bothering him? He came here to drop off Ramsha...
[18:44] No one even asked him to sit or offered him tea.
We're only concerned for you right now. You require help right now.
[18:54] Ramsha, did you talk to brother Saqlain?
He didn't pick up, as usual. I called sister Areeba and asked her to...
[19:07] book an appointment with mother's consultant.
What would brother Saqlain have done? I'll take care of this.
[19:15] Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I am fine.
[19:47] Listen...
[19:51] Ramsha called and told me that mother's blood pressure has spiked.
What should I do about that?
[19:56] You, people, have a new problem every day!
[20:06] I'm sorry... actually I'm stressed and I took out my anger on you.
What happened? Is everything alright?
[20:15] No, it's not. Anyways, tell me what happened to auntie?
[20:20] It must be the same blood pressure issue. Why doesn't she take her medicine on time? Ask Ramsha to give them to her on time.
[20:27] She likes planning for others, but she can't take care of her mother!
She does, but today she was having trouble breathing as well.
[20:37] What?
[20:37] That's why she called. She wanted you to make an appointment with her consultant.
[20:42] If you're busy, Mahnoor and Faraz are there. They'll take mother.
Who will they go to?
[20:52] Firstly, her consultant doesn't meet anyone without an appointment and we won't get an appointment so quickly. If they want to take her just anywhere...
[21:02] they can, but if something were to happen after that then I won't be responsible for it.
[21:06] Make them understand... there's no need to do anything stupid... I'll see what can be done.
[21:12] Sure...
[21:58] If you were so worried, you could have stayed there as I asked you to.
[22:03] No... I have work in the morning...
[22:08] and we didn't tell auntie as well. What must she be thinking, after all, we only went home to drop off Ramsha.
[22:15] That was nothing major. I would have talked to mother about it.
[22:20] It's alright... I've asked Ramsha to take care of mother and sleep with her today. I told her to call me if something were to happen.
[22:30] Auntie looked better to me. She talked to us for a while.
[22:38] By God's good grace.
Indeed.
[22:52] Greetings*
Please buy some flowers for your wife. 
[22:58] How do you know that?
Because every girl likes them.
[23:04] Give it to me then... I'll try and make my wife happy.
[23:13] Wear it.
[23:16] Thank you.
[23:37] Why is Fariya's number off?
[23:54] Why are you worried?
It's related to the business.
[24:01] I've had a great loss today.
[24:05] How's that?
[24:08] Because of my lack of attention, I underestimated the situation.
[24:13] Oh... what will you do now?
I'm thinking about that. There's no other option but...
[24:23] But?
[24:26] Other than investing money, deliver the consignment quickly and save me from that loss.
[24:35] Then do that...
It's about the money...
[24:39] It's an investment worth 20 million and it isn't possible to get that money from anywhere. The only option is for me to sell your shop and...
[24:55] And that is not an option.
No, you're right. We can do that.
[25:06] Sell the shop and save yourself from the loss.
[25:11] What's with you? How can you do that? It's your property.
That's disappointing...
[25:17] When has there ever been a difference between me and you?
[25:25] You work hard day and night for my comfort.
[25:29] You think of your family's pain as yours.
[25:34] Then can't I drive away your worry?
Try and understand...
[25:42] Enough... we won't argue about this. I always listen to you, don't I?
[25:47] Now, you'll have to listen to me.
[25:52] We'll think about that. How's auntie feeling now?
[25:58] Shall we visit her?
It's late...
[26:04] We'll go there tomorrow. Besides, I talked to Ramsha and she told me that she was fine.
[26:11] That's good... I'll do something about the doctor's appointment first thing in the morning.
[26:18] Will you make me tea? I have a headache.
Sure.
[26:44] Mahir!
What is it?
[26:48] Ramsha forgot her bag here in a hurry yesterday.
[26:51] Why are you telling me? What should I do about it?
You never try to listen and understand.
[26:58] You're going to university, give it to her there.
Keep it at the breakfast table, I'll grab it on my way out.
[27:07] Why are you looking at me? Go on...
I'm not your servant. I'm running late for college. Don't order me around!
[27:22] Congratulations.
Thank you.
[27:25] Faraz, congrats to you too.
Thank you.
[27:30] We brought sweetmeats for everyone.
[27:35] Miss Mahnoor, we've arranged a lunch for you at work today. Just as a treat for your wedding.
[27:43] And we'll be surely taking our treat as well.
Sure.
[27:48] Shall we go back to work?
Sure.
[27:56] You look perfectly well!
Yes, I'm better than before.
[28:02] I don't know why Ramsha and Mahi get so worried.
[28:05] You have no idea how worried Areeba was when I reached home yesterday. She's the one who told me that you were unwell.
[28:16] I'm sure you're the one who must have exaggerated things to her. She has a weak heart, what if something had happened to her?
[28:23] God forbid if something were to happen to her.
[28:30] Thank God you're fine now. I've made an appointment for you with the doctor. It's after two weeks. It was very hard for me to get it.
[28:37] Now you have to take your medicine on time.
[28:42] Are you listening?
I remind her every day, but she forgets to take it. 
[28:49] You have to sit with her and make her take them. Focus on your mother and forget about your other activities.
[28:58] Sure...
Auntie, I have to go now. Take care of yourself.
[29:06] Alright my dear, bless you.
Farewell*
[29:14] Ramsha, escort him out.
[29:31] Greetings*
[29:33] What are you doing here?
Ramsha forgot her bag yesterday when she visited us at our home.
[29:49] I forgot it there and I didn't remember it when I reached home.
Yes, you didn't come to university today as well.
[29:56] So... I decided to give it to you here. I thought you might need to study the books left inside.
[30:02] Sister Mahnoor told me not to because of mother's health.
That means that Mahnoor didn't send you here with that bag.
[30:10] Pardon?
Even though she knows that Ramsha didn't go to university today.
[30:16] No actually...
Thank you.
[30:29] No need for that. I'll get going.
[30:44] I don't want to see that guy in this house again.
[30:48] This house only has a relationship with Faraz. It's not appropriate for him to come here.
[30:53] Besides, because of Mahnoor, this house is defamed in the entire neighborhood.
[30:58] Do you want to make it worse?
Don't be so casual at university as well. You go there to study...
[31:06] you should focus on that. Take this... go inside and lock the door.
[31:29] Come in.
[31:48] I didn't ask for that coffee, did you order it for me?
[31:52] Obviously... you've been working since morning and look how tired you are.
[31:58] There have been back-to-back meetings since morning. I have to attend a board meeting...
[32:04] and then after that, I have to take a look at this production sheet.
Transfer that production sheet to me and I'll work on it.
[32:13] To you?
[32:14] Sure that will give you time to relax before the meeting. You'll feel fresh after drinking that coffee.
[32:23] Don't you trust that I can do this for you?
[32:32] No, I've always trusted you. I transferred you the file. Now it's your responsibility.
[32:39] Tell me, why didn't you have this coffee made for yourself?
[32:44] I wasn't in the mood.
How did you know that I was in the mood for coffee right now?
[32:54] Let that remain a secret. I can't share it.
[33:00] How's your mother feeling? Did you call her?
[33:04] I talked to her in the morning... she told me that she was fine.
[33:09] Thank God.
[33:13] Yes?
[33:16] Okay.
[33:19] There comes the call. They called all the managers to the conference room in five minutes.
[33:25] Great! Please... your coffee...
[33:31] Don't you think you've made matters worst? What if he backs off, or believes your lie?
[33:39] If he does, we'll lose this house.
[33:43] Don't you trust yourself?
You know how sly Saqlain is.
[33:48] If he was that sly, he wouldn't have believed us so easily. We told him that we outcast from a landlord family from Nawabshah.
[34:00] And he believed us immediately. He didn't even have us investigated.
[34:04] What if he investigates us now?
You're taking your mother lightly.
[34:11] I've hit the mark at the right time. He loves you...
[34:17] and he is sick and tired of his wife. This is the right time to take advantage of it.
[34:26] Look, he's calling again.
Pick it up.
[34:33] Hello...
Why is Fariya's phone turned off? 
[34:35] There must be signal issues there. Besides what will you gain from talking to her? I told you that she's getting married.
[34:45] And I'm going there as well.
How can she marry anyone else?
[34:50] I'm sure you must have forced her.
[34:56] Call Fariya back, otherwise, it won't be good for her.
What should I say to call her back?
[35:03] And why should I stop her from having a future? Does she not have a right to live a respectful life?
[35:09] I'll give her that right.
[35:10] What guarantee is there that the landlord will give her that right? He stole your right from you years ago!
[35:17] It's possible that this must be some trick to steal your share...
Listen Saqlain...
[35:21] I'm not in the mood to listen to anything. Call Fariya back immediately, and tell me when she comes back.
[35:30] I'm ready to marry her.
[35:35] Alright fine... then bring the cleric tomorrow. Fariya will be here tomorrow.
[35:43] Alright.
[35:51] The cleric is coming.
I really shouldn't have taken you lightly.
[35:57] I told you.
[36:02] Listen to me... don't take what brother Saqlain the wrong way.
[36:08] It's how his nature is.
[36:17] No, it's not like that. You have it wrong.
[36:22] Ramsha!
[36:25] I'll talk to you later.
[36:42] Mother! Sister Salma bring water quickly!
[37:30] Hello...
Sister Mahnoor?
[37:32] She has left and you are?
I'm her sister... it's urgent, pass the phone to her.
[37:40] She's in a board meeting and I can't take the phone inside...
[37:45] give me your number... I'll...
[37:47] Hello?
[37:50] Brother Faraz... let me call him.
[38:02] Hello... Ramsha?
Brother Faraz...
[38:06] What is the matter? Why are you crying?
Mother has fallen unconscious. She's not getting up.
[38:12] What?
