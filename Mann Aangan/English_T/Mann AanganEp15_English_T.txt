[01:02] you are not my boss!
[01:03] if you have got so much power of your position then go to your room & write a complaint against me
[01:07] and send it to the person whose dearest you are!
[01:09] I will leave when my termination letter will come. I won't spare him before that!
[01:17] I've to pay my brother's university fee next week for the entire semester
[01:21]  that's why I've applied for a loan against my provident fund, so that I can pay off on monthly basis
[01:36] this inflation has affected everyone so badly
[01:39] no matter how expensive things we purchase
[01:42] still we get bad stuff
[01:45] now look at these rice
[01:47] they are so bad, & they are getting sold in the price of gold
[01:51] what an ordinary person will do in this situation!
[01:54] mom
[01:56] yes
[01:57] look, the electricity bill is here
[01:59] here it comes, how much is it?
[02:01] check it
[02:04] oh God! its quite a lot
[02:08] there isn't any electricity or gas for an entire day & they have sent such a lengthy bill!
[02:12] oh God... 
[02:15] Ok keep it, I will ask Faraz to pay it once he comes back
[02:20] Faraz
[02:21] greetings!
[02:23] greetings to you too! dear, is everything alright? you came back early today
[02:29] yes, I was having some headache therefore I came early
[02:33] I am going to my room, I will do some rest
[02:41] its quite strange
[02:43] no matter whatever happens, he never comes back early
[02:48] and today he came back because of a headache
[02:53] I pray that everything is fine
[02:55] I think there is some other problem
[03:04] what have I done!
[03:07] I had gone mad! I have foolishly harm myself
[03:12] what shall I do?
[03:14] what shall I do now... 
[03:20] Ramsha.. 
[03:22] I have to do this as well. She cannot tidy up her room
[03:43] whose phone is it
[03:49] pick up the phone, Mahnoor
[03:58] she has cut the call
[04:13] pick up the phone, why aren't you picking it? You are getting Faraz's call
[04:23] if you need privacy then I can go outside the room, its fine
[04:27] what's with you? I don't need any kind of privacy to talk to my office colleague
[04:32] I will talk to him if I want to
[04:40] what happen, why are you being so angry?
[04:43] is everything fine? I mean, did you had a fight with someone at office?
[04:46] there isn't any such thing
[04:48] is everything fine? I mean, why you are so upset & angry. Did you had a fight with someone at office?
[04:56] there isn't any such thing
[04:57] then?
Ramsha, look at the room's condition
[05:00] you always keep your room untidy, either me or mom tidy up your room
[05:05] you've grown up, show some wise attitude
[05:08] sister, I have to use a lot of brain in my university & then we have to walk a lot & now you are giving such a big lecture
[05:17] I won't give you any lecture
[05:20] Okay fine, I will do it
[05:24] Ok, shall I tell you something?
[05:26] I've got 90% marks in my university's weekly assignment
[05:33] really!
[05:33] yes
[05:34] its such a good thing
[05:36] did you see, you had focused a bit of your studies & you have got such a good marks
[05:40] forget everything & just focus on your studies only
[05:44] there is no need to think about anything else. You'll see, you will get better marks than these
[05:49] Okay
[05:50] its such a good thing
[05:52] brother Faraz
yes
[05:55] what is the matter? Is everything alright?
[05:58] yes, everything is alright
[06:00] why?
[06:01] you seem quite worried
[06:04] even mom is so worried, how come you came so early today from your office?
[06:08] I had told you that I am not feeling well
[06:11] brother Faraz, you had never taken a day off even when you were so unwell. Then?
[06:19] Ok tell me
[06:22] I am your younger sister, you can share with me
[06:26] Ok sit
[06:40] what have you done!
[06:42] I don't believe it that you can pick a fight with someone
[06:46] I know, even I don't understand. How come I had become so numb at that time
[06:51] if you had to reply back to their misbehavior, then you could have register a complain
[06:56] and then you had a fight with your senior officer
[07:00] what if she did a complain against you? You will lose your job
[07:03] call her. Ask her to forgive you & end this matter
[07:09] I tried calling her, but she isn't responding
[07:13] Ok, but you'll go to the office tomorrow right?
[07:15] talk to her then. Maybe she forgives you after listening to the situation
[07:23] can you please bring tea for me
[07:26] please don't worry
[07:29] thanks
[08:18] Ok fine, we'll discuss it tomorrow
[08:20] listen!
[08:22] I'll talk to you later
[08:23] I've found it from your coat's pocket
[08:28] yes so?
[08:31] they are for whom?
[08:33] they seem quite expensive
[08:38] I've been trying to give you a surprise since so many days
[08:42] Besides, for whom I buy the jewelry except for you?
[08:47] last evening, I was stuck in a few matters so... 
[08:51] I didn't remember that its in my coat's pocket
[08:54] what is worrying you?
[08:56] you don't forget anything ever
[08:58] yes, I am worried
[09:01] I had told you that today I had gone to Mahnoor's office to talk to her about your mother's house construction
[09:08] what happen then? did she agree?
[09:12] don't know whether she will agree or not, because we cannot force her for anything
[09:18] Besides, its her amount so its her choice if she wants to give it or not
[09:22] but... the matter couldn't be discussed completely. There was a new issue in her office
[09:28] issue?
[09:31] which issue?
[09:32] that guy Faraz
[09:35] he was fighting with his office colleague
[09:38] Mahnoor tried to stop him, and he started misbehaving with her
[09:42] what!
[09:44] he had misbehaved with Mahnoor?
[09:46] but Mahnoor was telling me the guy is her junior & works with her
[09:49] this is what I am amazed about, also I am worried too
[09:55] why are you worried?
[09:57] Areeba, I haven't heard good things about that guy
[10:01] I have heard that once the police has arrested that guy from his office
[10:06] means that guy is a hooligan too
[10:09] yes! I got some investigation done
[10:12] I have got to know that his neighbors doesn't like him & his family
[10:18] I fear, what if Mahnoor takes any action in anger against him in the office then.. 
[10:26] even I am worried now
[10:29] see, such a big issue has arise
[10:32] I never wanted Mahnoor to do the job, but No!
[10:36] look, we have to face such a big problem now
[10:38] yes, the matter is worrisome
[10:42] but don't you worry, I'm here, nobody can harm Mahnoor until I am here
[10:49] before that guy does something wrong
[10:52] let me do his arrangements
[10:54] tell me, how do you find them?
[10:57] yes, they are very nice
[11:02] wear them & show it to me
[11:06] yes
[11:12] suits you! actually made for you
[11:15] thank you!
[11:20] let me show you by wearing both of them
[11:23] yes, go
[11:41] maam, I apologize to you
[11:44] I shouldn't have talked to you in that tone
[11:49] don't know what had happened to me, either I had gone insane or... 
[11:54] maybe I had lost my control
[11:57] how to control your anger
[12:00] how to handle your personal issues, you were lecturing me on it Right?
[12:05] if you had heard them talking about something inappropriate, then can't you handle this matter gracefully?
[12:11] how can a person handle their insult gracefully for so many times?
[12:16] I've been listening to their taunts for more than a year, and I've always been ignoring it
[12:20] I know that I am such a big looser
[12:24] my personal & professional life is a proof of unsuccessful things
[12:29] people get an idea about my class by looking at me
[12:32] but now if anyone will say classless to me on my face
[12:37] and shall insult me, so I should handle it gracefully too?
[12:40] look, I am quite ashamed of what Ashir & brother Saqlain had said
[12:45] its just because they are seeing you with me & that's why
[12:48] maam, I know it very well that not just you but I am not capable for any girl. Thank you!
[12:53] Mr. Faraz, neither you are a loser nor you have any quality missing in your personality
[12:59] you are such an intelligent, decent & a wise person
[13:04] and I've got an idea about it while working with you for the past few months
[13:10] are you saying it to appease me, or is this the truth?
[13:16] whenever you praise me & my work
[13:20] what does it mean, that you are saying it to appease me?
[13:25] I have never praised you falsely. In fact I have never done any such thing
[13:29] maam, you are so intelligent
[13:32] I have always respected you with the bottom of my heart
[13:37] not just because
[13:40] you hold a higher position than me
[13:42] then accept it
[13:44] that whatever I had said to you, I mean it
[13:47] that's why I haven't done your complaint to the boss
[13:50] both of the guys are given a warning
[13:53] because I know it very well, how important his job is for you
[13:58] and I don't want to become the reason of your worries
[14:04] anyways, we have wasted enough of the time. I think we should focus on the work now
[14:09] of-course!
[14:11] thank you!
[14:28] mom
[14:28] yes
[14:29] give this cheque to brother Saqlain
[14:31] he was saying that the house needs a lot of renovation, it will be rebuild as its condition is too bad
[14:37] really! So, why did he ask you for the money? Why he didn't ask me?
[14:42] because maybe he knows that you don't have enough amount
[14:46] the house will be demolished, and the expense will be almost 60 to 70 lacs
[14:52] dear, this the amount of your share of inheritance right?
[14:54] mom, how many times I have told you not to talk about share of inheritance. I don't want anything at all!
[15:01] whatever is there is yours, I just need your prayers
[15:05] dear, how can you think that I don't pray for you
[15:10] I always keep on praying for the three of you
[15:17] Mahi... 
[15:21] listen to me
[15:22] what?
[15:23] get married
[15:25] mom, not again! Just now I came back from office & you've started the same discussion
[15:31] that's why I am saying that you don't need to wander around once you get married
[15:37] you know, I am not doing this job because we are in need
[15:40] after marriage, to take care of the house, husband & children responsibilities
[15:46] a woman wants to rule on her house
[15:50] I mean, does a woman have this character only?
[15:53] I think, women who works & do business they can also run the house
[15:59] look at sister Salma, she works here for an entire day. Then she goes to her house & look after her kids
[16:05] what's with you, why are you doing your comparison with Salma?
[16:10] she is helpless and earning because her husband doesn't earns
[16:14] sister Salma is also a woman like us
[16:17] I am just trying to say that instead of begging in front of her family or strangers, to which thing she had given preference?
[16:23] that she has become independent by doing hard work. She has become her own support
[16:28] I also want to become independent & do something on my own
[16:32] and what was decided in between us? Don't you remember?
[16:35] I will get married, give me some time. Let me do the job first, I want to achieve something
[16:41] after that, I will marry whoever you will ask me to. I promise
[16:47] Ok, I am going to make coffee for myself. Would you like to drink some?
[16:52] yes I will
[16:53] Ok, let me bring it right away
[17:20] Mr. Faraz, neither you are a loser nor you have any quality missing in your personality
[17:27] you are such an intelligent, decent & a wise person
[17:36] and I've got an idea about it while working with you for the past few months
[18:06] the room of this prince charming is always so untidy
[18:13] my entire day gets wasted in tidying it
[18:47] are you done with cleaning?
[18:51] mom, look at this
[18:54] what is it? I won't be able to read it without my spectacles
[18:58] mom, this is Maheer's scholarship certificate
[19:01] it means, his entire semester's fee is waived off
[19:06] really?
[19:09] All praise to God, did you see?
[19:12] my son is so intelligent & wise that he got a scholarship
[19:17] check the date on it, its one month old
[19:21] Maheer has already taken this amount from brother Faraz
[19:28] it means that he...
[19:30] it means that Maheer had lied to brother Faraz & took the money. Also he hid this scholarship too
[19:35] oh Maheer...
[19:38] let him come, let me fix him
[19:42] oh God! he took almost 2.5 lac rupees
[19:45] he could have given it to me
[19:47] I would have bought a new fridge & an AC
[19:50] or else, I would have bought some jewelry for you from that money
[19:54] mom, its so bad. Brother Faraz will be so hurt, if he gets to know about it
[19:59] Ok, now don't tell the entire story to Faraz
[20:02] how many times I have told you not to tell every matter to him, keep a few things to yourself
[20:07] what do you mean? I shouldn't tell brother Faraz that Maheer had lied to him about the money
[20:11] be quiet! and end this matter
[20:15] I will explain Maheer not to do this again
[20:45] yes Mola Baksh, did he open his mouth?
[20:47] No sir
[20:49] open the gate, you'll see how quickly he will tell everything
[20:58] yes, Mr. Saqlain?
[21:00] I have got a small work for you. There is guy namely Faraz
[21:04] he works in my sister in law's office, he is harassing her. I want you to register an FIR against him
[21:12] he was threatening her in front of me
[21:15] but why you sister in law is not coming in person to register this complain?
[21:18] Inspector look, we don't find it appropriate that women of our house shall visit the police station. So this is the only reason 
[21:23] I mean, if she would have come to register the complain of harassment then we could have taken a big action
[21:29] Inspector look, she is my younger sister & my responsibility
[21:32] and because of that guy people are doing weird gossips in the neighborhood & office
[21:38] he wants to defame my sister in any way
[21:42] please register an FIR against him
[21:45] because her security & respect is my personal concern
[21:48] Ok, don't worry. I am registering your complain
[21:52] thank you so much!
[21:57] didn't you feel ashamed while spending the fee amount so casually?
[22:01] and that too in such a situation when we have got a lot of problems at home
[22:05] mom, as it is you had to give me that fee amount
[22:08] and I've earned the scholarship with my hard work. It doesn't mean that you don't give me the fee amount
[22:13] So, you do care about us?
[22:16] poor Faraz got you a bike with such a difficulty
[22:21] and paid your fee
[22:24] he got your admission by taking a loan
[22:27] if you had earned the scholarship with your hard work
[22:32] then didn't you think about your brother a bit, that you shall reduce his burden
[22:37] just think, when he will get to know
[22:40] that you haven't told the truth, how hurt he will be
[22:44] what is the problem!
[22:46] you signify your favor on me for everything
[22:48] tell me, have you done a favor on me by giving birth to me?
[22:52] No, no... it is you who did favor on me
[22:56] give me the money, where is it? Return it to me
[22:58] I don't have them, besides I have spent them
[23:01] what!
[23:02] what do you mean that you've spent them? Where you have spent such a big amount?
[23:07] I go to the university, I have got a lot of expenses
[23:11] should I stay like a beggar in front of my friends? No, right?
[23:14] Besides, I had gone for an outing so I have spent the entire amount on my friends
[23:19] oh God! you've spent such a big amount on your friends
[23:26] there is a limit of everything!
[23:28] greetings mom!
[23:30] greetings to you too!
[23:33] what happen, why are you scolding him?
[23:36] No dear, I am not scolding him but cursing my fate
[23:42] I had sent this fool with a 5000 rupee note to buy a few things
[23:46] and he lost it
[23:50] why are you standing here? Now get lost
[24:01] mom
[24:03] loss happens
[24:06] its alright! he wouldn't have lost them deliberately
[24:10] Ok, where is Aima?
[24:12] she had called & asked me to bring Samosa. I have brought another snack along with Samosa
[24:18] stay blessed my son, may God bless you with a lot of success
[24:23] may you always take care of your younger siblings in the same manner
[24:31] oh God...
[24:40] Sir, this madam will tell you about Mr. Faraz
[24:43] yes sir
[24:45] where is Faraz Ahmed?
[24:46] Mr. Faraz is inside the boss room
[24:49] call him immediately
[24:51] yes, there he is.
Mr. Faraz, they are here to meet you
[24:56] yes
[24:57] so, you are Mr. Faraz
[25:00] yes, I am Faraz Ahmed
[25:03] in what regards you want to meet me?
[25:05] we have received a complaint against you for harassment
[25:09] the girl's family has filed an FIR against you
[25:13] what are you saying? I have never harassed anyone
[25:17] what is the name of the person who has registered a complain against me
[25:21] I mean, I am sure you are having a misunderstanding
[25:24] she is your boss, Ms, Mahnoor
[25:27] you have threatened her, you follow her
[25:31] you are defaming her
[25:33] lets go to the police station, you'll get to know everything over there
[25:36] Mola Baksh
[25:37] yes sir
[25:38] arrest him!
[25:42] hey Mr. Faraz, at least give me the file
[25:46] but I haven't done any such thing
[25:49] ma'am, he was saying that your relatives...
[25:52] relatives!
[25:58] who else can do such a disgusting act except for brother Saqlain
[26:04] Okay you may leave
[26:06] yes
[26:07] and listen
[26:08] you will not talk to anyone about it in the office, nor you will tell anyone about it. Ok?
[26:13] but ma'am, everyone would have got to know about it as of yet
[26:16] the police came in the office & took away Mr. Faraz with them
[26:19] the security guard must have told this to boss directly
[26:40] sister Areeba, where are you?
[26:49] sister Areeba
[26:52] where has she gone
[26:56] sister Areeba
[26:59] Mahnoor! you are here at this hour!
[27:01] where is brother Saqlain?
[27:04] usually he is in his office at this time, but you...
[27:07] he isn't in his office, I am coming from there
[27:09] he isn't picking up my call as well. Please call him once & make me talk to him
[27:13] is everything alright? You look worried
[27:15] nothing is alright. 
Do you remember my office colleague Faraz?
[27:19] somebody has done a harassment case on him, that he is harassing me
[27:23] what do you mean?
[27:25] I mean, the police has arrested him
[27:28] they were saying that either me or my family has done a case on him
[27:32] I just want to confirm, whether brother Saqlain did it
[27:37] and I think, now he is not picking up my call deliberately
[27:40] please talk to him once, ask him to go to the police station with me & take back the complaint
[27:45] why should he take back the complain?
[27:47] and he did the right thing!
[27:50] its a good thing that the police shall treat him for a few days
[27:54] Saqlain was so worried, how that guy was threatening you so openly!
[28:00] God forbid if something bad would have happened with you, then?
[28:03] sister Areeba please! are you in your senses? Do you know for whom you are saying this?
[28:08] Faraz is not that kind of a person
[28:10] neither he has threatened me ever nor he is harassing me
[28:14] talk to brother Saqlain, at least ask him in which police station Faraz is
[28:20] I will go & take back the complain
[28:23] Mahnoor, sometimes I don't understand you
[28:27] you don't consider any relationship with that guy
[28:31] and on the other hand you are getting so restless for him, why!
[28:36] you always take every matter in the wrong direction
[28:39] that poor guy is innocent, he is in the jail for the crime he had never committed
[28:44] and not only he will be defamed in it, but I will also be defamed
[28:47] I will lose my respect in the office, I can also lose my job
[28:51] just think, how much I will be insulted
[28:54] please sister, talk to brother Saqlain for my sake. Ask him
[28:59] please call him
[29:17] he isn't responding
[29:20] what shall I do then?
[29:22] Ok come inside, sit for a while. Let me serve you some tea
[29:24] I am leaving
[29:27] Mahnoor...
[30:04] so much of restlessness
[30:05] anyways, I like your yearning for him
[30:08] tonight he will stay in the police station & tomorrow when he will come out then...
[30:13] for now, let me make an arrangement to proceed this matter further
[30:27] yes Aneeka, any update?
[30:31] No man, I've already checked 3 to 4 police stations which cover our area
[30:36] I am not getting any information at all
[30:38] the entire matter would have been solved if I could talk to brother Saqlain once
[30:43] he isn't receiving my call
[30:45] keep updating me, whatever you get to know please update me
[30:48] I don't want Faraz to spend his night in the jail today
[30:52] and that too for the crime he hasn't done
[30:57] please, do let me know if you get to know anything. Thank you!
[31:17] Inspector, please believe me I haven't threatened her
[31:21] neither I have harassed her ever, you must be having a misunderstanding
[31:23] this is what you are saying
[31:25] Mahnoor's family has filed a report & we are taking an action accordingly
[31:31] do you know, a very big legal action can be done against you for harassing a female office colleague
[31:37] She is lying, also her family is lying. I am innocent
[31:41] Sir, do one thing. Call her here & ask her to tell us that when have I harassed her or threatened her
[31:47] when Mahnoor's brother in law had filed the report, he had told us that Mahnoor will not come to the police station
[31:53] anyways, now you'll meet her in the court so you can tell your complaints
[31:59] let us do our work
[32:02] go inside, tonight you are our guest
[32:05] look, you cannot keep me here forcefully
[32:08] at least, let me make a call. My family must be worried for me
[32:11] and remember, I've got a complete right to do my personal lawyer
[32:15] you know your legal rights very well
[32:18] but you don't know
[32:20] that harassing a woman is such a heinous crime
[32:24] Mola Baksh
[32:25] yes sir
[32:25] put him in the lock up
[32:31] one thing is decided
[32:33] I will ask Faraz not to pay your next year fee
[32:37] what are you saying?
[32:39] how will I pay the fee if I don't get the scholarship next year?
[32:44] you will arrange it yourself
[32:46] or else, you'll pay your fee from the amount you took this year by lying
[32:51] mom, I've told you already that I have spent most of the money from it
[32:55] no matter from where you arrange it. I will not give you a single penny
[33:00] I am thinking about Aima's marriage, also I have a suitor
[33:05] I just pray that Faraz agrees, then I will wed her off immediately
[33:09] this amount will be helpful in her marriage, and what about you!
[33:13] you can go and spend the money once again on your friends
[33:16] in order to show off!
[33:19] you are always after the money...
[33:23] Why Faraz is taking so long! why he hasn't come as of yet?
[33:26] Aima... call Faraz
[33:33] what shall I do?
[33:40] yes, did you talk to Faraz?
[33:44] mom, I had called but his number is switched off
[33:48] you should have called his office then, its 8 PM and he hasn't come back as of yet
[33:52] he always call to inform whenever he gets late
[33:56] mom, I had called at his office but there was a security guard & he told me that...
[34:01] what did he say? Tell me, why are you adamant to stop my heart?
[34:05] mom, the police has arrested brother Faraz
[34:10] what!
[34:12] what rubbish you are talking!
[34:15] why will the police arrest Faraz?
[34:18] he is my innocent son, what has he done?
[34:22] call him again, he must be lying
[34:25] in fact, I'll talk to him myself. Call him
[34:29] I will talk to him myself
[34:32] give it to me
[34:35] hello brother, this is Faraz's mother speaking
[34:41] what!
[34:43] No but...
[34:50] what is this!
[34:52] oh God! how come we are facing such a big problem all of a sudden?
[34:58] Maheer....
Maheer
[35:04] what happen mom, why are you shouting?
[35:05] the police has arrested Faraz
[35:08] what! the police has arrested brother Faraz! but why?
[35:11] how would I know?
[35:13] don't know what rubbish the guard was uttering
[35:21] Maheer listen to me, go & bring your brother back home
[35:27] my son has never done anything bad with anyone then why the police took him?
[35:32] where will I search for him now? in which police station?
[35:36] will you keep on arguing with me? Don't waste the time
[35:41] explain her! where will I search for brother Faraz?
[35:45] they wouldn't have taken him on the moon, he must be in the same city
[35:48] go & find out. You'll get to know about my son
[35:52] Maheer, you can at least go & check
[35:56] Okay, I am going
[35:59] why are you getting worried? Come here
[36:02] where has my son gone!
[36:04] please sit here
don't know where they have taken my son
[36:07] don't worry, let me go & see where he is
[36:11] take care of her
[36:14] don't know where they have taken my son
[36:20] mom, please don't cry
[36:24] God willing, nothing will happen to brother Faraz. He will come back soon
[36:27] God willing, my son will come back
[36:33] mom, I couldn't even think that brother Saqlain can stoop so low to degrade me
[36:38] that he had put a false allegation on an innocent person without any reason
[36:41] dear, Saqlain wanted your betterment
[36:43] my betterment! he can never think about doing any of my betterment
[36:48] he did all of this to degrade me, however this matter didn't had any logic
[36:53] why did he put a blame on Faraz? Just because he used to help me
[36:57] but sister Areeba was saying that he had a fight with you in the office & that too in front of brother Saqlain
[37:02] but that was official matter
[37:03] the official matter should have ended there & then.
[37:05] What was the need to put a blame on him & to file a complain the police?
[37:09] and now see, he isn't responding my call
[37:13] why are you getting worried?
[37:15] if he is innocent, then you don't need to worry
[37:19] he will come out himself
[37:21] what do you think? Shouldn't I be worried about Faraz?
[37:24] all of this is happening to him because of me
[37:27] it is almost night time & we don't know in which police station he is in
[37:31] and his family! what is their fault? They must be worried without any reason
[37:35] even they wouldn't be knowing that where is he
[37:38] I can understand
[37:39] No mom, you cannot understand that how bad the the situation can be
[37:45] what do you think? Only Faraz will be defamed in this matter?
[37:48] my name will be taken as well
[37:50] I have to answer in front of the management that why did I put such a false blame on him
[37:55] everyone will joke about me, I have to answer everyone's questions
[38:10] Maheer, did you get any update about brother Faraz?
[38:13] how can we get to know so easily?
[38:16] did you check at the police station or not?
[38:20] yes, I had gone to the police station nearby his office
[38:24] but brother Faraz wasn't there
