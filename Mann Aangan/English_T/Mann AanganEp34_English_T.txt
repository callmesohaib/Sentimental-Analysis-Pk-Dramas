[01:11] how are you feeling now?
[01:13] thanks to God, I am much better than before
[01:16] thank God!
[01:18] I thought, since there was so much of crowd in the hospital. So I will meet you once you come back home
[01:27] everyone was with you, your daughters & sons in law
[01:30] yes
[01:32] I used to ask Faraz & Mahnoor about your well being
[01:37] Faraz did such a great care of me
[01:41] my son is such a nice heart guy, he gets worried if he sees anyone in distress
[01:52] and then Mahnoor was always so worried about you
[01:57] these guys follow their wives everywhere
[02:03] I haven't put any house chores responsibility on Mahnoor's shoulders
[02:07] she does job, how can she manage home?
[02:14] if a girl have her own problems then its difficult for her to manage her in-laws house
[02:25] anyways, I came to give you an invitation
[02:30] I have kept my daughter Aima's engagement on Sunday
[02:33] really! heartiest congratulations to you. May God bless Aima with good fate
[02:40] Ameen
[02:43] there isn't any big function, its just a small ceremony at home
[02:48] greetings!
[02:50] greetings to you too! stay blessed
please keep it here
[02:57] you have to come
[02:59] I will try my level best
[03:08] Maheer!
[03:11] yes dear, tell me
[03:17] yes dear, you shall come in a while
[03:25] it was Maheer's call. He was asking me if he could come to pick me
[03:30] how can he come to pick you? At least have tea, not just tea I will get the lunch served. So that you can have it before leaving
[03:38] there is no need for any formality. 
Actually Faraz was busy so he had sent Maheer with me
[03:46] he doesn't visit any relative's house though, he wasn't ready to come here as well
[03:51] my son is very shy. He doesn't refuse Faraz for anything that's why he came here
[03:57] by the way, your children are so obedient
[04:02] thanks to God
[04:07] aunty, please take some tea
[04:10] yes
[04:11] mom, you also take some
[04:20] hey, leave it. I will eat it myself
[04:25] Sir, heartiest congratulations to you
[04:27] oh brother, will you only congratulate him? What about sweetmeats?
[04:32] first of all tell me, in what joy these sweets are?
[04:35] what do you mean? Hasn't maam Mahnoor told you anything?
[04:39] Sir, an acknowledgment letter is sent to our department for best performance
[04:44] its such a good news, everyone has appreciated our department
[04:48] Mr. Faraz, now see you always scold us that we don't work
[04:52] here, the management has written that the commercial department of our office is the best of all
[04:59] so this is the consequences of that scolding, you guys perform very well after getting scolded
[05:04] come on
[05:06] congratulations to you too!
thank you!
[05:10] has everyone got it? anyone else needs more?
[05:14] Fine, I will have all of them
[05:19] well done Mahnoor! I was expecting this from you. Your department's results are outstanding. Very good!
[05:26] thank you sir!
[05:27] absolutely sir, the rest of the managers just talk
[05:33] but Ms. Mahnoor, you have proved it with your performance. You are one of the best
[05:49] Faraz, come sit
[05:54] guys, the higher management is very happy with your performance. You've done such a tremendous job
[06:01] you have given best performance
[06:04] and in written, I've specially requested boss to increase your bonus & increment both
[06:10] as soon as possible. Ok guys?
[06:13] thank you so much
[06:15] you are welcome! Ms. Mahnoor, I've got one more good news for you. You'll be promoted this year
[06:20] so you better get ready for more hard work & challenges
[06:29] Sure sir, thank you so much!
[06:36] thank you!
[06:50] Saqlain, look.. the report is here
[06:57] my guess was correct, the report is positive
[07:01] what!
[07:10] now you have to take good care of Fariya
[07:13] hey, is this something to say?
[07:16] let me bring sweets for both of you, lets celebrate
[07:20] Okay
[07:28] Saqlain
[07:29] yes
[07:30] if today, I will ask something from you then won't you refuse me?
[07:35] impossible! what do you want? Gold or diamond? name it & I will get it for you
[07:42] you have given me the most happiest news of my life
[07:46] what do you want, what is your wish? Tell me so that I can fulfill it
[07:50] Saqlain, I want to do a business & I would be needing some investment from you
[07:57] business! but you don't have any know how about it
[08:01] what's the big deal if I don't have any know how. But I can learn it
[08:05] but... in this condition?
[08:08] Saqlain, I will manage & you had said to me that you won't refuse
[08:14] I am not stopping you but right now you have to take care of yourself & our baby
[08:19] and its not an easy task to manage a business
[08:22] Saqlain, I will manage everything. Besides, I won't be alone. I will have a business partner along with me
[08:29] business partner!
[08:32] Rameez! he is my aunt's son & mom had made him her so-called son
[08:37] he had gone abroad, & now he is back. And now he is starting is boutique
[08:44] and Saqlain, do you know it was long term desire that I should have my own boutique
[08:50] and you had said to me that you won't stop me
[08:53] I have fulfilled the biggest desire of your life, & you cannot fulfill such a small desire of mine
[09:00] hey! I am not stopping you
[09:05] Ok fine, but on one condition
[09:09] what?
[09:11] you have to take very good care of yourself, I don't need any kind of carelessness
[09:16] promise
[09:18] really?
[09:21] thank you so much
[09:27] here, I've brought sweetmeats for you
[09:31] have some, not much
[09:34] at least tell me the reason
[09:38] actually I have been promoted
[09:43] oh wow! all praise to God... heartiest congratulations, may God bless you with more success
[09:50] its all because of your prayers, mom
[09:53] this is the result of your hard work
[09:57] you haven't just tried but you have done a lot of efforts too
[10:05] and you've reached to your destination because of your hard work & struggle
[10:13] still I have to reach at the destination
[10:16] let me clear my CSS exams once, then everything will be good
[10:24] I pray for you guys at all times, my dear
[10:30] anyways, your mother in law had visited
[10:34] yes, she must have come to give an invitation for Aima's engagement
[10:38] dear, I don't have that much courage to attend it. Since she had invited me with so much of love, so I couldn't refuse her
[10:46] but I won't be able to go, my dear. I will send Ramsha on my behalf
[10:54] No, there is no need for Ramsha to come
[10:59] besides, the function is not that big. Its just a small family gathering
[11:04] I will do an excuse from your side, aunty will also understand it
[11:08] Okay dear, as you find appropriate
[11:13] just be careful that she doesn't mind it
[11:18] Mahi.... dear, try to focus on your family too
[11:25] I found a bit of complain in your mother in law's words
[11:30] had she said something to you?
[11:32] No Mahi, she hadn't said any such thing to me
[11:36] just try to focus on your family more than us
[11:43] yes
[11:51] this is complete injustice with us
[11:54] we do the hard work all night long, & these managers shall eat the earnings
[11:58] what else? We were celebrating & distributing sweets upon getting a letter as if we've done some tremendous job
[12:06] Rizwan, as per my opinion they are doing injustice with Mr. Faraz
[12:11] Mr. Faraz's grade should have been increased
[12:14] actually the main obstacle in Mr. Faraz's career is his own wife
[12:20] now see, since two of a trade seldom agree
[12:24] the same way, both of these husband & wife cannot work on the same rank
[12:28] Mr. Faraz wanted to help his wife
[12:31] what happened? He just got a 5% increment like we got
[12:57] if she will start focusing on her family then how will she make the life of others a living hell?
[13:02] no matter whatever she does, but she puts restrictions on others!
[13:45] what are you thinking?
[13:48] No, I was just checking the list. Mom had given it to me
[13:54] shall I look?
[14:03] I will take mom & Aima for shopping
[14:08] No, mom will manage
[14:13] already you are so busy in the day time
[14:16] what will you do by going on the shopping?
[14:20] I will manage
[14:24] Okay, as you wish
[14:28] by the way, mom have money so you don't have to spend anything
[14:41] why am I feeling that you are upset with me
[14:53] No
[14:55] why do you feel this way?
[15:00] everyone had congratulated me on my promotion, but you...
[15:10] maybe I had forgotten
[15:13] I was so busy in work & then its Aima's engagement so I got busy in it
[15:23] heartiest congratulations to you!
[15:33] your success is the fruits of your day & night hard work
[15:45] by the way, why were you expecting a formal congratulations from my side?
[15:53] I wasn't expecting this promotion
[15:59] that's why I had told you that I shall give your appraisal sheet to someone else
[16:05] so that you can get the complete credit of your hard work
[16:10] you already know
[16:13] the GM does managers appraisal himself, he had raised my grade too
[16:22] I didn't know anything about it
[16:26] I know
[16:33] you are feeling that I am being jealous of your success?
[16:35] absolutely not!
[16:39] and this cannot happen as well
[16:44] because this success is because of you
[16:53] whether its a house or office
[16:55] if I hadn't got your support, then nothing was possible
[17:03] and...
[17:05] I am thinking to resign from my job
[17:10] don't ever do this stupidity
[17:13] what kind of stupidity? I have to leave the job after 6 months as well
[17:19] so let me leave it now, Beside I am doing this job just for gaining experience
[17:24] yes, but still continue your job until your result comes & your training starts
[17:32] I will always support you
[17:42] thank God!
[17:44] otherwise, I was sacred what if you...
Mahnoor we...
[17:49] no matter if we don't think wrong, but others make us think wrong
[17:59] that's why they say that one shouldn't listen to others
[18:05] what do you mean?
[18:14] nothing!
[18:24] shall we drink tea?
[18:26] yes
[19:02] greetings, sister Suraiyya
[19:04] greetings to you too!
how are you doing?
[19:06] where is mom?
[19:07] madam is upstairs
[19:09] Okay, please bring tea for Saqlain
[19:12] yes sister
[19:14] Areeba
[19:17] one minute, please
[19:24] yes
[19:26] haven't you discussed that matter with your mother?
[19:31] which one?
[19:32] about the girl who came to our house on that day & started to talk rubbish!
[19:37] I don't want to worry mom by discussing all these things
[19:42] Besides, you had told me that she was lying & talking rubbish
[19:47] yes, you did great by not telling this to your mother
[19:51] her health doesn't allow to know such rubbish matters
[19:59] you did great! I hope you haven't told Mahnoor
[20:05] No, I haven't talked about it with anyone
[20:10] yes
[20:12] I am feeling so ashamed
[20:17] what will people say when they'll hear it
[20:19] that I did a good deed with such a stupid & shallow person
[20:27] now leave this topic, but be careful next time
[20:32] people take undue advantage of your soft nature
[20:36] and you should know this
[20:38] yes... I will be careful next time
[20:42] come, lets meet mom
lets go
[21:29] its Mahi's sister in law's engagement ceremony
[21:35] so, will you go on the engagement ceremony?
[21:39] No, I was thinking to send either gifts or money with Ramsha
[21:46] suggest me, what shall I do?
[21:50] mom, I cannot comment on this matter. He will guide you better
[21:55] I had told Mahi
[21:59] that Ramsha will attend the function in my place, but she refused
[22:03] why had she refused?
[22:05] if you are unable to go, then Ramsha can go at your place
[22:09] Besides, they have invited us for the very first time on their event. And it will look so bad if none of us will attend it
[22:19] yes, he is absolutely correct. Mahnoor is so stupid
[22:23] its the matter of her in-laws family, one should think about it
[22:30] alright then Ramsha, be ready I will drop you off at Mahnoor's house
[22:34] anyone can drop you back home from there
[22:41] yes
[22:54] haven't you gone mad?
you want me to get exposed in front of your husband?
[22:59] so, don't you love me?
[23:01] I do love you but... 
then no ifs or buts
[23:04] we've got only one way to defeat Saqlain. that we should have the same amount of wealth as he has
[23:13] otherwise, you won't be able to compete him
[23:16] what if he gets to know about us, then?
[23:19] who will tell him?
[23:23] he only knows that you my cousin, and my mom's so-called son
[23:30] you have to stick on the same thing, understand?
[23:34] what if something goes wrong, then?
[23:35] you are getting scared for no reason, nothing will happen. This is why I am making you meet Saqlain
[23:41] so that he can be satisfied.
and yes! make a proposal for boutique
[23:48] it will give a good impression on Saqlain
[23:52] hmm...
[23:54] good idea!
[23:58] Rameez, I trust you that's why I am making you meet Saqlain
[24:06] I know you can do anything for me
[24:12] and now everything depends on you. How you keep my honor & trust intact
[24:18] I can give my life for you, Fariya
[25:10] all praise to God! you are looking so pretty
[25:14] but your smile is missing. Today is such a big day for you, at least smile a little
[25:22] what kind of brainwashing you are doing?
[25:28] No aunty, actually I came to do Aima's makeover
[25:32] Are you done? Now leave
[25:38] there is no need to do her brainwashing
[25:41] its a joyous occasion, I don't want anything inappropriate
[25:46] okay
[25:47] sister, one minute
[25:51] Aima...
[25:52] mom, you say anything without even thinking
[25:58] sister was explaining me that I should be happy today, because its such a big day of my life
[26:03] and you have started to scold her
[26:06] Aima, be quiet
[26:10] she is our elder, she can say anything to us
[26:15] she is your mother, one shouldn't talk like this with their elders
[26:23] she is ready
[26:29] mom, don't do so much injustice with sister in law that I have to bear the consequences of your wrong doings
[26:57] please come.
Mahnoor, look who is here
[27:01] hey Ramsha!
[27:03] greetings!*
[27:06] how are you? And with whom you came here?
[27:09] I came with brother Saqlain
[27:11] he said, since mother is not well & she cannot go so you should go
[27:22] and, mom has sent a few gifts for you guys
[27:27] hey Ramsha, there was no need for these gifts. Since you are here so its enough for us
[27:34] please sit, let me go & change
[27:37] its quite late now. 
Mahnoor, had you taken out my clothes?
[27:40] yes, I have hanged your clothes after pressing them. Please go & get ready
[27:44] you have to be quickly get ready too, we have very less time
[27:52] Ramsha, I had told you not to come here
[27:56] yes, so I haven't come here as per my will
[27:59] brother Saqlain had brought me here, you guys have made me a football!
[28:06] and if you want me to leave from here, then I am leaving right away
[28:44] Maheer
[28:46] yes
[28:47] hey, where have you been? I've been looking for you since so long
[28:50] I'm here since morning, where do I have to go?
[28:54] oh dear, a lot of work is left and the guests are about to come.
[28:58] Faraz has been working since morning, now you also do some work
[29:02] Okay
[29:30] hey Ramsha, when did you come?
[29:33] just a while ago
[29:36] greetings!*
[29:40] your mother hasn't come?
[29:42] No, actually mom was so unwell so she asked me to go
[29:47] yes, I can understand. 
Mahnoor, make her sit, why is she standing?
[29:53] yes
[29:57] come with me, sit in Aima's room
[30:00] stay there until I get ready, come
[30:04] come on
[30:55] you seem worried
[30:58] No
[31:01] but you look quite disturbed by your face
[31:06] hasn't mom said anything to you?
[31:07] No, aunty hasn't said anything
[31:10] and I'm thinking that Ramsha had left mom all alone, what if she gets unwell then?
[31:17] don't take tension. She must be fine, otherwise she wouldn't have sent Ramsha
[31:23] yes
[33:05] umm... you haven't told me that how am I looking
[33:12] you are looking so pretty
[33:15] thank you!
[33:17] honestly
[33:18] even you are looking so nice
thank you so much!
[33:26] please get well soon, I am so worried for you
[33:36] Umm... shall we leave, Areeba?
[33:41] how can we leave mom alone?
[33:44] hey, no dear its quite late night now. You guys shall go
[33:48] No mom, God forbid if something happens to you then?
[33:52] No Areeba, Ramsha must be on her way back. Don't worry about me, besides...
[33:57] Saqlain is tired, let him rest
[34:00] No aunty, I am not that tired though. Also Areeba is right
[34:05] its not appropriate to leave you alone in this condition
[34:11] let Ramsha come, then we'll leave
[34:14] Areeba, till then do one thing. Bring me a nice cup of tea
[34:18] yes, let me bring it
[34:51] come here
[34:54] what are you doing?
[34:56] can't you see, how Maheer is surrounded by other girls!
[35:02] when will you remove this blindfold from your eyes?
[35:21] sister Shehla, if you allow then can we start the rituals?
[35:24] yes absolutely, please start
[36:34] don't take too much tension about me
[36:36] hey, you've taken my entire tensions. May God keep you happy
[36:43] you take very good care of this house & of me
[36:49] if I would have a real son, even he wouldn't have cared so much the way you do
[36:56] no matter if I am not your real son, but still I am your son
[37:06] you guys should leave as soon as Ramsha comes, as its quite late night now
[37:49] Maheer
[38:06] Maheer, actually....
Ramsha!
[38:18] come, let me drop you home as its quite late night now
[38:30] shall we?
[38:31] Faraz, go & sit inside the car with Ramsha. Meanwhile, let me go & change
[38:34] Sure
[38:35] Okay?
Come on
[39:05] it has become very important to answer you
[39:09] you had insulted me, right?
[39:11] soon, I will take its revenge from you
