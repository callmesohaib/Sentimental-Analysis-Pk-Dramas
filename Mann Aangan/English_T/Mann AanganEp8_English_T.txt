[01:11] Auntie, I did talk to my auntie. Infact, I had a big fight
[01:15] how could Ashir take a big decision? If he didn't want to marry Mahnoor ..
[01:20] then what was this all needed?
[01:23] If he didn't want to marry, then why did he sign wedding papers?
[01:27] We were thinking about only engagement
[01:30] and it was Ashir who said that ..
[01:33] he should get married before leaving. He was in rush
[01:37] It was Ashir who was forcing to get married to Mahnoor
[01:42] Mahnoor even refused.
[01:46] Then why did he do so?
[01:51] Areeba, this happened because of this all.
[01:54] because Mahnoor didn't want to get married to Ashir and wanted to get married to Wasif
[01:59] so this all happened
[02:01] Don't try to change the topic by mentioning Wasif.
[02:05] The truth is that your cousin took out his frustration at me
[02:09] Your cousin whom you and sister Areeba kept on praising
[02:20] Mahi but ..
[02:20] But mother? He told the truth that he never wanted to marry me.
[02:26] He only said yes because he wanted to take revenge
[02:31] Revenge because I refused his proposal earlier
[02:37] but Ashir told another reason to auntie. Due to which he had refused to marry you
[02:46] and what is that reason?
[02:49] Ashir got to know about her and Wasif.
[02:52] Now tell me, if a decent guy finds out that the girl whom he is getting married is having an affair ..
[02:58] how would he marry her?
[03:02] Fine, then tell me this. How did Ashir find it out?
[03:09] You can put this blame on me, that I told him about you and Wasif
[03:13] If I had to, I would have told him before the proposal about her and Wasif
[03:20] I wouldn't have kept it hidden.
[03:23] I kept it hidden and I really wanted her to get married with respect
[03:29] I know that my child Saqlain. You have always thought about our betterment.
[03:34] May be, this pain was written in our fate
[03:39] this why our happiness went away
[03:42] They are sent back.
[03:44] Your happiness are sent back and this can only be done by people who had problem with this proposal.
[03:52] Either it could be Wasif or Mahnoor herself
[04:35] Is brother Saqlain telling the truth?
[04:38] Did you tell Ashir that you ..
[04:40] Please, you should at least trust me.
[04:45] Don't doubt me in this condition
[04:49] But this is something to think about. How did they find out at last moment that you ..
[04:53] Brother Saqlain told everything to Ashir.
[04:57] If you don't trust me, you can confirm it
[05:02] You'll find out the truth
[05:04] But can brother Saqlain stoop so low?
[05:07] and it was him who forced you and his cousin to get married.
[05:11] Infact, he was leaving sister Areeba for this
[05:14] he did
[05:18] Brother Saqlain and Ashir all insisted, and then this happened
[05:27] They think  that by doing so they have defeated me
[05:40] you are so hurt?
[05:44] Lots of tension is going on. Also, mother isn't well
[05:50] and we forgot in this all, that how hurt would you be.
[05:56] No, I'm fine.
[06:02] Life is incomplete without tests
[06:06] and I have accepted it as a test and got my patience.
[06:15] patience? How could you have patience so soon
[06:20] may be, you never loved him
[06:26] love?
[06:30] I agreed to marry him without love
[06:34] but I trust God
[06:39] He will do whatever is best for me
[06:45] but ..
[06:48] mother?
[06:52] You know mother. She has a small heart.
[06:56] I have to be patient.
[06:59] If I'd cry in front of her, she won't be able to tolerate it
[07:05] I have to be her support.
[07:10] I can't make her weak
[07:14] If she'd see me crying, something might happen to her.
[07:18] Then what will we do? We'll be left alone
[07:24] I can be patient for whatever happened to me
[07:29] but if something happens to mother
[07:32] then we won't be able to tolerate it
[07:36] This is why, I want us not to talk on this topic in front of mother
[07:47] She won't be able to tolerate it
[07:53] We have to be her support.
[07:57] I can't be weak in front of her
[08:18] Whom are you calling early in the morning?
[08:24] mother .. She was ill
[08:28] I'm too worried about her. I couldn't sleep the whole night
[08:31] She might be fine! Otherwise, Ramsha or Mahnoor would have informed
[08:40] We got this big problem out of nowhere. I'm too scared and worried
[08:47] I'm too worried too.
[08:50] But whatever happened, happened because of Mahnoor
[08:54] Sometimes, nature do give you what you want.
[08:57] And it was her wish. Ashir had finally found it out
[09:02] Mahnoor refused earlier, I do agree
[09:07] but she agreed later
[09:10] She didn't want to get divorce.
[09:12] I do agree that we had to face humiliation
[09:16] but this divorce has hurt her a lot too
[09:20] really? Her face didn't have such expressions.
[09:25] You looked more sad than her
[09:28] I think she hadn't even shed a tear. She has no shame
[09:32] But Saqlain
[09:33] Look, don't argue early in the morning.
I'm having headache thinking about this all
[09:39] Focus a little on this house and me.
Stop thinking about your family
[09:45] Earlier, you were involved in Mahnoor's wedding.
Now you are crying for her divorce
[09:49] Don't you have a responsibility of this house?
[09:55] I have always fulfilled my responsibility
[09:57] Fine, go and make me breakfast.
[10:00] I'm having a bad headache. I don't even feel like going to office.
[10:05] I'll have breakfast and rest
[10:09] now go and make breakfast
[10:11] Yes! I'm making
[10:21] Weird people are present in my life
[10:38] mother?
[10:40] Please have food. You have to take medicines too
[10:43] No my child, I'm not hungry.
[10:46] Also, medicines aren't going to effect
[10:52] sister, you explain it to mother. She isn't listening to me.
[10:57] Ask her to have food. She has to take medicines
[11:00] Mother, how would this work?
[11:02] You can get sick if you won't have food. You have to take food
[11:07] Mahi ..
[11:09] don't worry about me
[11:13] I won't leave you people so soon and go.
[11:16] Your father has already left, but I have taken time from God.
[11:23] Until I have got your both married
[11:27] and fulfill my responsibility, I won't go
[11:32] What are you saying? Don't even think about it
[11:38] After father left ..
[11:41] We never felt that we are orphans.
[11:44] It was because you were there with us.
[11:48] If something would happen to you then we'd be orphans
[11:55] whatever happened
[11:58] it has happened
[12:02] we have to forget it now
[12:05] we have to move forward.
[12:07] After father's demise, we handled that pain too.
[12:12] This pain is nothing in front of that
[12:15] This is mine alone. Why are you worried
[12:20] My child, your problems and pains aren't separate. You are ours
[12:28] I don't like it
[12:31] Only because of me, why are you, Ramsha and everyone are worried?
[12:38] making and breaking of relationships are a part of life
[12:48] but this doesn't mean that a person stops living life and give up
[12:57] but my child, society doesn't leave it alone
[13:02] but this society can't take my freedom from me
[13:05] and I'm not answerable to this society for my future life
[13:11] what do you want, Mahi?
[13:13] what new world do you want to make, tell me?
[13:17] I want to live my life
[13:20] according to my way
[13:24] My wedding broke and I got divorced
[13:28] Do you want me to stop living my life because of all what happened?
[13:35] this is what I want to say, Mahi. As soon as I'll get a good proposal ..
[13:40] Mother please ..
[13:45] don't talk about wedding to me
[13:49] I don't want to get married
[13:57] you asked me to get married
[14:00] I did what you said.
[14:03] I stopped dreaming because of the wedding but what happened?
[14:11] the relationship that wasn't written in my fate
[14:14] shouldn't be made forcefully
[14:18] I ..
[14:20] I want to get out of this all and do something in my life. I want to forget everything
[14:26] I want to work and do CCS
[14:31] I stopped because you asked.
[14:34] Now I won't compromise on my dreams.
[14:38] As far as wedding is concerned, I don't want to get married right now.
[14:42] I will tell you when I want to ..
[14:45] but before that you won't force me
[14:50] okay!
[14:51] Now have food
[14:58] I will
[15:06] Many congratulations on your wedding Mahnoor.
[15:09] I pray that this journey of your life is filled with happiness
[15:16] I am writing this all with so much courage. But what do I do, I had to show courage.
[15:21] My purpose was never to create troubles for you
[15:25] In some time I realized, that love isn't about achieving it.
[15:29] Infact, we should pray for happiness of people we love
[15:39] either he/she is with us or not
[15:43] this is also love. I will keep praying for your happiness.
[15:48] And I promise, I would never be a trouble for you
[15:54] but you have to make a promise too.
[15:57] In life if you face any trouble
[16:02] or feel that you need me,
[16:05] you'd contact me without hesitating.
[16:08] our relation started with a friendship.
[16:11] Everything is ended now but friendship won't end ever.
[16:27] Have you dropped your CV?
[16:32] yes, I have done it
[16:43] Why do you look so upset?
[16:46] no, I'm fine
[16:50] I just hope that you get a job
[16:53] God willing
[16:55] I will get it
[17:13] its amazing ..
[17:14] Neither she told anyone nor asked, and now she wants to work
[17:19] mother, why didn't you stop her?
[17:21] she doesn't listen to auntie
[17:26] auntie, you have no idea
[17:29] what are people talking about
[17:33] I am avoiding all the relatives.
[17:37] As soon as someone meets me, they ask they why did your sister in law get divorce?
[17:45] she got divorced 2 days before wedding.
[17:47] Mahnoor doesn't even care about it. That woman is making future plans
[17:55] don't mind auntie, but all of this is because of your liberty
[17:58] After all this happened, I thought you'd keep her at home. According to me ..
[18:03] According to you, I should hang myself
[18:07] I have been humiliated so much
[18:08] My husband got to know about my previous affair so he divorced me in anger.
[18:14] According to you, I shouldn't step out of house now
[18:21] why do you need to work?
[18:23] Can't you sit at home in peace?
[18:25] I and Saqlain are trying to find a good proposal for you. We'll get you married soon ..
[18:30] proposal? You and brother Saqlain had already found a proposal for me. What happened to it?
[18:39] That wasn't our fault
[18:41] because of your own ..
[18:42] I am not blaming anyone. I just want to move forward in my life
[18:48] nothing else
[18:49] auntie, what is it that you don't have. Now you'll have Mahnoor's earning too
[18:53] Even you have everything.
[18:55] You have family property.
[18:57] Also, you get rent from sister Areeba's shops then why are you working?
[19:09] I'm a man. I have to work
[19:13] It doesn't look good if I sit at home
[19:16] but auntie, you have no idea that it very difficult to find proposals of girls who are working
[19:23] brother Saqlain, don't measure me with a balance of men and women.
[19:28] I don't want to sit at home and waste my life
[19:30] I also don't want to turn into psycho by thinking that what will people think about me if I'd leave home
[19:38] no one would say anything to you. It is us who have to listen
[19:41] then don't listen. Infact, go and break their faces.
[19:46] Infact, why don't you change your social circle. These people say you anything they want anytime.
[19:58] but remember one thing
[20:00] I have taken a decision. I will definitely work
[20:15] Mother can you see, how is talking?
[21:18] Everything has started again
[21:21] I'm scared what if they come after me
[21:24] My college result isn't out yet. I have to take admission in university
[21:29] why don't you talk to brother Wasif?
[21:34] what for?
[21:41] He wanted to get married to you. Now you aren't even committed.
[21:45] do you want that I go back to him because I couldn't move forward?
[21:53] there is no problem in this
[21:55] you both like each other
[22:04] Our love ended months ago
[22:08] if he's still standing there, then it isn't my fault
[22:15] what do you think?
[22:18] if I couldn't reach my destination
[22:21] should I go back to him again?
[22:24] Even if he wants, I would never go back to him again
[22:28] sister?
[22:30] Ramsha please
[22:32] look
[22:35] I am not so selfish.
[22:39] I can't take advantage of someone else because of my own benefit.
[22:42] Wasif was my past. We have parted ways
[22:49] and now whatever happens
[22:51] we can't be together
[23:00] This happened because your sister's actions
[23:04] Infact, forget her. She is happy and living her life.
[23:09] It is me who is facing humiliation
[23:16] everything is in front of you
[23:18] I and mother both talked to Mahnoor. If she isn't listening then how is it our fault?
[23:22] she will regret and you too
[23:25] God knows what will happen in future because of this liberty.
[23:29] Isn't an affair and divorce enough?
[23:34] Mahnoor should go to hell. Infact, your whole family should go to hell. I have raised my hands
[23:40] I was humiliated whenever I tried doing kindness to you people.
[24:59] what do I tell you? I have such busy life
[25:03] I don't even get time to scratch my head
[25:05] hmm .. she still keeps visiting people
[25:11] nothing! I was asking you to have juice and relax
[25:17] A person should keep meeting others and console each other
[25:24] humanity would end if we won't help each other in such hard time
[25:31] greetings!
[25:31] Greetings! O Mahnoor, you went outside?
[25:38] I thought you'd be at home. Her iddat is still left
[25:43] Auntie, there is no iddat before proper wedding. You can even check
[25:50] absolutely!
[25:55] She went outside because there was something important
[26:02] sister\
[26:04] I swear to God, I'm having a headache.
[26:07] That auntie has been sitting for last 2 hours and repeating one thing again and again. O hello!!
[26:13] and mother is listening to her silently. She isn't answering her to make her quiet
[26:22] where are you going?
[26:25] to make her shut. Not only her, but rest of our relatives too
[26:31] I am thinking to call everyone and tell them what happened to me.
[26:35] At least, their excuse to come here and show sympathy would end
[26:42] a divorced daughter is like a huge burden for a mother
[26:47] May God never show this day to even an enemy.
[26:50] I curse such people who gave this stain of divorce to Mahnoor.
[26:58] You'd see that God would take the revenge
[27:01] Yes, because God doesn't forgive a person until he has been forgiven by the person he has hurt
[27:12] and God doesn't even like people hurting His men verbally or physically
[27:18] Mahi
[27:19] auntie, I do agree that you feel sad for whatever happened to me. Infact more than me.
[27:25] This is why everyday, either someone comes to show this sympathy or call.
[27:31] My bad luck is that you people are more hurt than me
[27:37] Girl, what are you trying to say?
[27:39] all I am saying is that keep this pain to yourself
[27:48] there is no need to tell us because we have overcome it.
[27:53] And stop coming here daily and sprinkling salt on our wounds in the name of sympathy
[27:58] Wow! People say it right that don't be kind to anyone.
[28:04] Write one thing down sister Saira, your daughter is sitting at home because of her tongue
[28:12] O God, she should be ashamed on this thing but look at her speaking too much in front of everyone
[28:20] You are right, auntie. Those should be ashamed too who make other people's pain a drama
[28:27] and make fun of them in the name of sympathy
[28:32] Can you see it Saira, how is your daughter humiliating me?
[28:36]  I would never step in your house again.
[28:56] You just came back. Now you are going again?
[28:59] Yes, auntie called. She has a pain in her knee. 
[29:07] I thought to go and ask about her health
[29:09] Ashir did so much unfair to Mahnoor
[29:13] and auntie didn't apologize to mother even once
[29:20] and you ..
[29:23] you are going to ask about her health?
[29:29] what do you want?
[29:32] shall I end my relationship with auntie?
[29:34]  Ashir and Mahnoor's relationship ended because of Mahnoor. 
[29:38] How is it auntie's fault?
[29:42] If you see ..
[29:42] Your sister insults me everyday. 
[29:46] Because of her and her affair, 
[29:49] I had to face humiliation in front of Ashir and auntie
[29:55] you haven't ended your relationship with your sister
[29:58] then why do you expect me to end my relationship with my real auntie?
[30:03]  Listen to me, 
[30:06] its a blood relation
[30:09] I'm going to meet her. And you also have to meet her for me
[30:15] because of your sister's actions
[30:17] I can't end my relation with her
[30:20] understood?
[30:23] understood?
[30:28] hmm
[30:30] Good!
[31:12] What is it Ramsha? Why do you look upset?
[31:16] I don't get it
[31:18] mother got upset and went to the room
[31:26] what wrong did we do by answering auntie?
[31:33] our own relatives ..
[31:36] they disappear quickly when we need them
[31:45] but they are called our relatives
[31:51] I don't understand that why doesn't mother say anything to them?
[31:55] I mean, I'm sure mother doesn't like what they say
[32:02] Listen. don't you worry. I'll explain it to mother. Infact, come with me
[32:12] I know that you are upset
[32:14] and you should be
[32:18] a low tempered child like me
[32:20] who has never listened to you and has hurt you
[32:25] one should be upset from such child
[32:28] no matter how disobedient a child is, a mother always pray for them
[32:33] and you are never bad. 
[32:36] You are my most adorable daughter. 
[32:40] You have always realized my pain
[32:43] but what happens to you suddenly. You think that everyone is an enemy
[32:50] Mother, I find everyone our enemy who tries to make fun of our problem.
[32:54]  Instead of making our problems easy, they try to make us feel inferior
[32:58] my child, this news has spread in the whole family like a wildfire.
[33:02] everyone is talking about you and I can't see your humiliation
[33:09] it had to be spread
[33:12] Brother Saqlain is there to do so. 
[33:16] As far as humiliation is concerned,
[33:20]  I can't be fake
[33:24] It isn't Saqlain's fault
[33:26] It was just written in our fate
[33:29] fate? then fine, accept it as God's will and be patient
[33:38] If we'll talk to people, they will dig our wounds deep instead of healing them up.
[33:43] Mother, sister is right. Sister didn't get married. 
[33:47] Before a bride's departure, if the marriage contract ends, its completely like as if someone's engagement has ended.
[33:52] and engagements do break. Its not a big deal
[33:56] And you think about it, if people would keep reminding us our pain daily then how would we move forward?
[34:04] when will we forget this all?
[34:06] once you are married, people would get quiet
[34:11] I will get married on the right time. 
[34:13] As far as these people are concerned, they'd be quiet when I'd become something.
[34:21] Don't take tension
[34:23] how can I not? Saqlain was so upset
[34:27] After hearing about your job. I don't know how will he react when you'll get the job
[34:50] how is the food?
[34:52] its fine
[34:58] I made this all for you
[35:02] I know that its your favorite
[35:05] hmm
[35:10] how was auntie?
[35:12] She was fine. She was asking about you. 
[35:17] Did you talk to Mahnoor?
[35:19] Is she still obsessed with job or is it resolved?
[35:25] I haven't talked to anyone since many days. 
[35:28] Neither to mother nor Mahnoor
[35:32] this is why I have no idea what is happening at their home
[35:37] why? why didn't you talk?
[35:40] you were right
[35:43] I should focus on you and my house
[35:46] I shouldn't get worried about my mother's and sister's problem
[35:51] Infact, I was thinking that you shouldn't worry about them either. 
[35:55] They can handle their rental issues themselves.
[35:59]  You shouldn't waste your energy for no reason
[36:03] Mahnoor can handle it herself
[36:05] are you gone mad?
[36:08] I mean, what are you saying?
[36:14] why would Mahnoor handle things that I do?
[36:18] I am saying it for you
[36:21] whenever their matter is discussed, our conflict happens.
[36:26]  Mahnoor wants to be the head of that house,
[36:31]  let her be.
[36:33] Everytime, I have to be embarrassed in front of you because of her. 
[36:37] And she doesn't care. 
[36:40] I have decided that I won't enter that house again
[36:46] what has happened to you? Why are you getting upset because of Mahnoor?
[36:52] how can you end your relation with auntie because of Mahnoor. Look at me, I'm in front of you. 
[36:57] Mahnoor misbehaves with me every time
[37:00] She has blamed me even that she got married to a wrong person because of me. 
[37:04] She blames me for her divorce too
[37:08] She blamed you wrongly. 
[37:11] Nothing happened because of you.
[37:15] Look, after hearing so much if I'm not ending this relation then why are you making an issue out of it? 
[37:21] Think about auntie. How hurt would she be if you won't meet her or talk?
[37:28] Call her after finishing your food
[37:31] and we will go meet them in a day or two
[37:34] they don't think this well as you think
[37:41] I'll go and check what is going on there. She considers me mad
[37:47] I'd step back because of these issues and give my control to Mahnoor?
[37:53] My dominance would stay only if I'd keep her aside. 
[37:57] Otherwise I'd lose control of everything
[38:05] don't take tension. Have food
