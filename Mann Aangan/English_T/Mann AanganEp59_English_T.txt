[01:37] Open the door Ramsha.
[01:41] Open the door, otherwise, I'll break it!
[01:56] Why was this door locked?
[01:59] What were you doing behind the closed door?
Nothing.
[02:04] I asked you to come down for dinner.
[02:07] I'm not hungry.
You're not hungry.
[02:12] Leave my hand...
[02:19] What did I do?
Why are you behaving like this to me?
[02:23] I'll tell you right now.
Let go of my hand.
[02:32] Sit down. Sit down. Sit down!
[02:44] Don't ever refuse to do anything for me. I'm not used to it.
[02:49] And whether you're hungry or not, I need you to be here, because I'm not used to eating alone!
[03:04] Eat!
[03:11] I'm not coming, I have things to do. I'll tell you if I'm coming. Don't bother me by calling again and again.
[03:21] Why are you standing here? Go away!
[03:38] Eat!
[04:01] Why isn't this accursed man picking up?
[04:06] What happened?
He's not picking up.
[04:09] Why are you calling him? He may be busy somewhere.
Where? I asked him to do one thing, and he couldn't even manage to do that.
[04:17] Lord knows if he'll do it or not. Areeba has let a loose cannon out of nowhere.
[04:24] I don't believe this. It's possible that she might be turning Saqlain against us.
[04:31] Come on... she's not like us. And Saqlain trusts her.
[04:39] Did you not see how he ran off? His color changed when he heard about the baby.
[04:47] I'm very worried.
You're right... he didn't even meet you before he left.
[04:53] The entire plan is ruined. I thought that I would have Areeba divorced and have her humiliated.
[05:00] I would ask him when this house will be sold if he would only just pick it up!
[05:05] Be patient.... it will be sold.
I can't be any more patient.
[05:11] Once this house is sold, I'll take his money and run away.
[05:16] Before Areeba uses the child to remove me from his life, I'll curse him and leave.
[05:24] Call him again, this time he will pick up.
Lord knows why he isn't picking up.
[05:33] Fool!
[08:00] Areeba...
[08:04] Why are you behaving like a child?
[08:08] Sorry.
[08:19] What do you want to tell me?
[08:22] Is there any excuse that you have left?
[08:27] Any excuse that you haven't used to make a fool out of me?
[08:33] Do you know that I don't lie?
[08:37] I used to think that as well.
[08:40] Until your real face became apparent to me.
[08:46] I used to trust your blindly.
[08:53] What sin have I committed?
[08:56] I only married again. It's not like I was having an affair.
[09:01] You must remember that you're the one who used to tell me...
[09:05] that if I want to have a child, I should marry someone else.
[09:10] I love you. I didn't share this with you because I didn't want to cause you pain.
[09:17] You made me out to be a criminal.
[09:21] I'm sure that Mahnoor provoked you against me.
[09:25] How long will you blame others for your wrongdoings?
[09:34] Wrongdoings?
[09:37] What wrong have I done? I only married...
I've found that necklace.
[09:42] The necklace you took from the thieves and put in the closet.
[09:50] They weren't thieves, right?
[09:55] You are the ones who sent them.
[09:59] So that they can steal Mahnoor's money from me.
[10:08] How much did you get paid to get Ramsha married?
[10:19] What nonsense are you saying?
I heard everything last night.
[10:25] You were talking to Tauqir.
[10:32] I have an old friendship with him.
[10:35] We talk about our business.
[10:39] And you are the one who was adamant about getting her married to him.
[10:44] I refused...
Exactly how you were not willing to get Wasay and Mahnoor married...
[10:53] You realized that Wasay and Mahnoor are suited for each other.
[11:02] So you send him to Mahnoor.
[11:06] So that Faraz learns everything...
[11:09] and once more my sister's life is destroyed.
[11:13] I...
[11:18] Mahnoor was right about you.
[11:24] And I thought she was lying about everything.
[11:29] To save my home...
[11:37] I trusted you blindly!
[11:45] And you...
[11:49] always betrayed my trust.
[12:00] I didn't do anything like that.
[12:05] Mahnoor did all of this. She told you all of this, right?
[12:11] This is the same sister who alleged me of killing your mother.
It's possible that you killed my mother!
[12:25] She just didn't think of you as a son...
[12:30] she treated you like one as well and what did you do?
[12:36] You make 'son' sound like a bad word!
Areeba!
[13:00] Even if you raise your hand to me today...
[13:05] I will not be disappointed.
[13:14] I'm sorry.
[13:17] I'm sorry.
[13:21] I know that you're not feeling well.
[13:25] You won't understand a thing right now... you...
[13:30] won't understand anything I say...
[13:35] Yes, we'll talk about this later.
[13:42] With time you will understand everything...
[13:46] You just take care of yourself.
[14:14] Time has told me everything
[15:02] Hello... greetings... how are you?
[15:07] I'm fine.
[15:08] Today's your first day at work, right? I was just about to message you.
[15:14] Not today...
[15:16] I'll join from next week...
But the brother said that you would join...
[15:20] It's not your brother's company, so I won't follow his rules and regulations.
[15:24] He's an ordinary employee and I work according to myself.
[15:29] That's why I decided to start on a weekday. I won't get into a routine if I start like this.
[15:35] That seems fine.
Shall I say something?
[15:40] What?
[15:43] That day at work, brother Faraz talked to me quite firmly...
[15:52] I didn't say anything to him, thinking he was my elder.
[15:56] Otherwise, if anyone else talks to me like that I...
But Yasir... brother...
[16:03] He didn't mention anything to his mother.
What would he have said?
[16:10] Would he have said that he was taunting and that since I was recommended by him, I'll have to be wary of him?
[16:15] That I'll have to fear him?
[16:18] But Yasir...
Let me complete myself Aima!
[16:23] Don't speak in between.
[16:29] I know full and well the position your brother has at the office.
[16:34] He's under his wife's thumb. And if used his reference being his close relative...
[16:43] would he taunt me for it?
I know brother can never do something like this...
[16:47] Am I lying then?
[16:50] Does your brother think that if I tolerated him once...
[16:58] he can say whatever he wants to me?
[17:01] That will never happen. I have a better position at work than him... and if he tries to mess with me again...
[17:08] then I will remind him of his worth.
[17:47] Sister Areeba, please stop crying...
[17:50] Tell me what happened. Who was that woman with brother Saqlain that day?
[18:00] Tell us what happened. Who was that girl with brother Saqlain that day?
[18:19] She...
[18:23] was her second wife.
[18:29] What?
[18:31] Yes...
[18:35] She was Saqlain's second wife...
[18:40] He married her in secret.
[18:45] Only because I was barren
[18:48] What do you mean by that? How can brother Saqlain do this to you?
[18:54] I'm not barren
[18:58] It's okay sister...
You don't believe me, right?
[19:11] Look at this...
[19:15] This is my report.
[19:21] I'm about to become a mother.
[19:40] Please be quiet and sit here...
[19:46] Control yourself... it's not good for you to be worried in this state.
[19:51] I don't understand what I should do.
[19:58] Brother Saqlain...
[20:00] I expected him to stoop to any level.
[20:06] But... never did I expect...
[20:10] that he would be so cruel to you.
[20:19] I was afraid of this for years...
[20:22] I was afraid that he would grow tired of me and marry some other woman for a child.
[20:36] I listened and agreed to everything he said...
[20:45] Mother...
[20:52] you... Ramsha...
[20:57] I made everyone his servant.
[21:11] I was manipulated by Saqlain...
[21:16] and because of his lies...
[21:25] Whatever injustice I did to you two...
[21:34] for that I am ashamed...
[21:40] Very ashamed...
[21:45] Why are you ashamed? You have no fault in this.
[22:01] But I never took what you said seriously.
[22:07] I never believed anything you said.
[22:12] I thought...
[22:15] I thought...
[22:18] that you were irritated by Saqlain.
[22:28] But you were aware of his real face.
[22:33] That's true.
[22:42] But...
[22:44] I always noticed one thing... the way brother Saqlain seems to be...
[22:50] he isn't like that at all.
[22:52] Do you remember that he always used to say...
[22:57] that he's not the son-in-law, but the son of this house.
[23:00] And he asked us to even put his shoes into place.
[23:06] You know how controlling he was.
[23:10] Not a single leaf used to move into that house without his permission.
[23:18] He always disgraced me.
[23:24] And I always hid my eyes...
[23:30] Maybe in fear...
[23:33] that I might lose my home.
[23:42] My childlessness had made me insecure...
[24:02] But today the slant of a barren woman has been removed from me.
[24:13] But I...
[24:18] I was so unfortunate...
[24:22] I always thought that...
[24:26] my husband loves me...
[24:30] that he's the best man on this planet.
[24:51] I was sincere...
[24:54] and loving... and this is my punishment for it.
[25:03] Why are you blaming yourself? You have no blame to take for this.
[25:10] You only made one mistake... you became afraid of brother Saqlain.
[25:19] You guys...
[25:21] Take good care of Ramsha...
[25:25] On Saqlain's say so...
[25:28] Lord knows what I did to Ramsha...
[25:32] You guys need to be in contact with her.
Why are you saying such things?
[25:39] We all are together. We will always take care of you.
[25:48] Do you know...
[25:53] Saqlain was asking Tawqir to be harsh with Ramsha.
[26:02] And keep her away from us.
[26:05] Never!
[26:07] I will never let that happen. I was silent when things were unjust to Ramsha...
[26:14] and that was the biggest mistake of my life, but now I will not stay silent.
[26:20] I will not tolerate this.
[26:22] Nothing bad will happen to her.
[26:28] Mahnoor...
[26:32] I think that Saqlain is lying about Mahir...
[26:38] Do you remember...
[26:41] the things he said about Faraz, to turn us against him?
[26:55] If Faraz is so nice...
[26:59] then...
[27:02] his brother can't be a bad person.
[27:13] You are very lucky Mahnoor...
[27:18] You have Faraz with you.
[27:23] And Faraz is a good man.
[27:31] Always stand by my sister like this.
[27:39] Never leave her alone.
[27:42] Please...
[27:44] We will take care of the two of us. Don't worry.
[27:57] Saqlain sending Wasay back to Mahnoor...
[28:02] created a rift between you two.
[28:14] But don't be suspicious of Mahnoor.
[28:21] Always be like this with her.
[28:24] Don't let Saqlain be successful in his objective.
[28:44] My reports!
[29:28] Don't cry sister... if you cry so much, your eyes will dry out.
[29:40] What else should I do, if not cry?
[29:43] At least this way I can ease the burden on my heart...
I feel sympathy for you.
[29:49] And... I'm surprised as well. You're so young...
[29:55] What happened that your family was forced to marry you to a man that was older than you?
[30:06] I had become a problem for them.
[30:10] Whatever it may be.... they should have thought of it before marrying you.
[30:16] Even when someone is forced to, it's hard to be married to a man like him.
[30:22] I've entrapped myself working here. I have to work here because I'm in need.
[30:27] I'm looking for a good place to work, I'll leave as soon as I find it.
[30:33] Will you leave this place as well?
[30:37] Yes... because I'm afraid of his anger.
[30:43] You know this, look how he treated you yesterday.
[30:54] Where will I go?
[30:58] I...
[31:00] am not even allowed to leave this house.
[31:04] I can't even meet my sisters.
[31:09] I'm trapped here.
[31:18] Please don't leave me.
[31:21] I'll be alone.
[31:50] Don't worry... relax and talk to them.
[31:54] He's not at home... I'll tell you as soon as he comes home.
[32:19] Hello Mahir...
Ramsha, thank God you picked up!
[32:24] I've been calling you for ages, but you weren't picking up.
[32:29] Ramsha...
[32:31] Are you crying... Is everything fine? Ramsha please tell me...
[32:37] I'm not fine... nothing is fine.
[32:41] Nothing is well.
Ramsha what should I do to make this better?
[32:49] What else can I do for you?
[32:52] I can't do anything... my life has become a mess.
[32:58] It's all my fault... your life became hell because of me. If only I hadn't asked you to leave that day with me...
[33:06] If only that time could return when I could reprimand myself for my mistake.
[33:11] Miss... he's outside.
[33:15] I'll talk to you later Mahir...
[33:18] Tawqir is here...
Ramsha... Ramsha...
[34:43] He will do something...
[34:53] What did he say?
He said that he liked the house.
[34:56] And he's willing to pay our price. He just wants the documents to be in place...
[35:04] And that he won't buy a place where there's a fuss...
We have the papers.
[35:08] This house is in my name and the papers are in my name as well.
[35:12] So... no need to worry about that. Finalize this deal.
[35:17] That's fine, but Saqlain...
[35:21] To hell with Saqlain...
[35:23] He can't do anything and you don't need to worry about it. I'll handle him.
[35:28] He filed a false report against me.
[35:32] I didn't do anything, if he finds out I'm involved with something...
[35:38] then what will he do to me?
It's not like you have to stay here to face Saqlain...
[35:43] She's right... you're coming with me... you need to fear Saqlain.
[35:50] Just take the money for this house and leave.
[35:53] Do you understand?
Okay, I'll try to get things done this week.
[36:00] Sure son.
Listen, Saqlain can come here any moment.
[36:05] Take them and leave. Take them...
Sure...
[36:13] Excuse me.
[36:19] It's good that this problem is getting fixed as well...
[36:23] May God bless Ramiz for being useful at the right time.
[36:27] And he is also being a sacrificial lamb for us.
[36:34] He is so naive... he doesn't suspect that I can keep the money as well.
[36:40] He thinks that Saqlain has filed a false case against him.
[36:45] He shouldn't know. We have a lot for Ramiz to do.
[36:51] We have to leave this city as soon as possible
[36:54] Then we'll think about what we need to do with Ramiz. Whether we should keep him or leave.
[37:08] We'll remove him as well... a new place...
[37:12] new guy...
[37:15] I've grown tired of dealing with all the fools!
[37:28] Really... so they are using me. They want to betray Saqlain by using me...
[37:39] But this won't happen again.
[37:42] You can't always make me a fool in the name of love.
[37:50] Hey, how are you?
[37:57] She was crying.
[38:02] And I felt like doing something to myself.
[38:07] Because I'm the reason for her tears.
[38:12] Why are you blaming yourself?
Because I've wronged her.
[38:18] She was crying because of me. I entrapped her in my love and she's in this state because of me.
[38:26] She was also crying because she couldn't have her true love.
[38:33] Because she was sincere with you...
[38:38] but you were flirting with her.
