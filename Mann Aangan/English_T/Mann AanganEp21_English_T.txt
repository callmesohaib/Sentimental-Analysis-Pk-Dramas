[01:14] How's Mahnoor's mother?
She's very happy. You should call her or visit her sometime.
[01:23] She'll be very happy with that.
How's her house?
[01:30] Is it appropriate for living, I'm sure she must have her own room.
Yes, her room is nice.
[01:38] It is old, nevertheless, it is big.
[01:45] Yes, I heard. Other than Faraz there are just two more people who live there.
[01:53] I don't know why Mahnoor got married into that house.
[01:58] Anyways, what can we say? It was Mahnoor's choice.
[02:05] Auntie...
[02:08] This is half the payment of the check that Mahnoor gave me. The rest I'm sure Areeba already gave you.
[02:15] Inside it is a list of the arrangements that were made for Mahnoor's wedding.
[02:26] What are you saying, my dear? I will not look nice at all taking an account from you.
[02:32] You've already done me a great favor by working so hard on Mahi's wedding.
[02:41] Auntie, who would have done it if not me? I'm happy that you acknowledge that.
[02:50] Why wouldn't I? I will pay Mahi's money.
[02:55] But I wanted to transfer the second shop to her name as well.
[03:03] I'll manage the rest of the money for it if you can ask the lawyer to have the paperwork done.
[03:10] That means that you want to cut off both of your arms.
[03:16] What do you mean?
[03:21] Why do you think I had them write the dower as ten lacs for Mahnoor?
[03:28] I know that they are greedy people and I only had that written for Mahnoor's security.
[03:36] You've handed your educated and self-sustaining daughter to those greedy people.
[03:43] Do you also want to give them the shops which are millions?
[03:53] Anyways, what can I say? They are your shops...
[03:59] You asked me to have the paperwork done and I'll ask the lawyers to have the paperwork done.
[04:05] No... there is no need to transfer the shop to Mahnoor right now.
[04:10] Let's be patient for a while and see whether or not Mahnoor can live there or not. There you can give her, her share.
[04:55] Do you know... some things one could only wish for.
[05:01] But one can never hope for them to come true.
[05:06] Really?
[05:09] What is that wish that cannot be fulfilled?
[05:13] It's exactly the way we're out here today.
[05:17] Sit down.
[05:24] Whenever I feel like relaxing...
[05:28] I feel like going to the beach, or a picnic spot. But this fast life...
[05:35] never allowed me to go. On top of that, it seems weird to go alone.
[05:41] When I've come here with you, it seems that my wish has come true.
[05:49] That is a very innocent request.
[05:53] Yes... big wish can hold a person captive.
[05:59] Do you trust me?
[06:02] I'm not like how people talked about me.
[06:07] I respect women. Then how can I...
Faraz...
[06:15] I've known you for a year...
[06:19] I can read people and it doesn't matter to me what people say
[06:25] You should forget about the past.
[06:38] Shall we visit your mother after we leave?
My mother?
[06:42] Don't you want to meet your mother?
[06:46] Ever since you got married, you never asked me to take you to your mother's.
[06:53] I do feel like going there, but not much time has passed since our marriage.
[06:58] Mother asked me to visit as well but...
[07:02] it's hard to find the time for it.
Alright then, from here we'll go and visit your mother.
[07:12] Alright.
Let's go.
[07:27] Greetings*
Mahi!
[07:31] When did you get here?
Greetings*
[07:36] Greetings*
[07:40] Areeba just left, if she had known she would have stayed. You should have called before coming.
[07:47] Mother, it was a sudden change of plans. Faraz decided to bring me here, otherwise, we were going home.
[07:56] It's alright. Now that you guys are here...
[07:59] please leave after you have dinner. Mother, let's order out because...
[08:05] this is the first time that brother Faraz is visiting us.
Please...
[08:10] don't be so formal. I might have come here for the first time, but it's not the last time. Besides, I'll be a usual here when I come here with Mahnoor.
[08:18] If you treat me like a guest, then I won't like it. I'm sure that there must be something already cooked at home.
[08:24] We'll eat that, no problem.
Alright... come and sit down.
[08:41] Mother...
[08:43] Why haven't you slept yet? I'll open the door when brother Faraz comes.
How can I sleep?
[08:50] I won't be able to sleep until Faraz comes back. I always wait for him.
[08:56] He's never done this. Besides, someone has to open the door.
[09:02] Wait, I'll call him.
There is no need to call him. Couldn't he have called and informed us?
[09:10] Going out with his wife doesn't mean that he stops caring for his family.
[09:19] Here they are!
[09:23] Mother, why are you still up?
You know I can't sleep until you reach home safely.
[09:32] And... where were you so late at night?
[09:36] Mother... we went to visit Mahnoor's mother. She asked us to stay for dinner.
[09:43] And then we lost track of time.
[09:49] Here I am worried sick about you. Wondering what could have happened.
[09:58] And you took your wife to her mother's house.
[10:04] You've been out for such a long time, couldn't you have called and informed me?
[10:10] Forget about even asking for my permission.
[10:14] I'm sorry auntie, we should have informed before leaving. This won't happen next time.
[10:51] Mahnoor, I'm sorry. I apologize to you on my mother's behalf. Please don't mind what she says.
[10:59] She just...
Why are you apologizing to me?
[11:05] Whatever auntie said was right. We were wrong.
[11:10] We shouldn't have left without telling her.
[11:14] But no matter, in the future we'll be careful. We'll go nowhere without telling her.
[11:20] It's not a good thing to have objections in the household over trivial matters.
[11:48] Hi.
[11:51] Hi...
How are you?
[11:55] I'm fine, how are you?
Perfect.
[11:59] How's sister Mahnoor?
She's fine as well.
[12:02] You should visit her.
I will, someday.
[12:07] I can see that you've not been discussing your notes with me, or studying with me, all good?
[12:17] How can I discuss that? You always stay so busy.
[12:22] Come on, you are our relative now...
[12:27] and you can ask me whatever you want, whenever you want it. No problem.
[12:36] I'll get going now. Bye.
[12:39] What's with him? How come he's changed so much?
[12:46] He just mentioned that we are now relatives of each other.
[12:50] Surprisingly, he's changed completely after he became your relative.
[12:56] I don't care about that. I'm just happy that he's started talking to me.
[13:04] Let's go.
[13:12] Hello...
Greetings I'm Areeba speaking, I would like to talk to Saqlain.
[13:16] Mr. Saqlain isn't at work, you can try his cellphone.
His number has been switched off since the morning.
[13:25] Give me the number to his Hyderabad office, he might have gone there.
We have no offices in Hyderabad.
[13:34] There's no office in Hyderabad?
And Mr. Saqlain just left the office.
[13:40] He's not left for Hyderabad, nor did he have any such plan.
Alright, thank you so much.
[13:52] For a few months, Saqlain has been telling that he's been doing business in Hyderabad.
[13:59] That means that he's lying to me.
[14:05] If he's lying, then why?
[14:10] What reason could be behind it?
[14:27] Sister, if you don't mind, can I come inside?
[14:31] Sure, come in. Even if I'm busy you can still come in. No need to be so formal.
[14:44] Sister... what are you doing?
Just some office work.
[14:50] I decided to check my mail. Faraz is out taking care of some business as well. You tell me, what do you do other than study?
[15:01] I wasn't able to talk to you these past few days.
I'm not busy with much. I go to college, come back home, and do housework.
[15:11] That is enough to keep one busy. Other than that, what other activities do you have?
[15:18] Nothing but my home and college. But tell me about your job.
[15:23] No... I'll go and make tea and then we'll talk.
Sure.
[15:36] Who are you making tea for at this hour?
For sister Mahnoor.
[15:40] Sister Mahnoor! Make me one as well.
[15:44] I'm your mother... do you see how she's made you your servant.
[15:51] I told you not to be her lackey but you don't listen to me.
[15:58] No one becomes a servant by making tea for someone.
She can make it herself.
[16:04] Her hands aren't covered with henna that are stopping her from working.
[16:09] It's been four days since she got married, why do you want her to work? It's possible that she doesn't know how to work in a kitchen
[16:17] Then she should learn. Every girl works inside the house after they get married. She's not special.
[16:25] I'm warning you not to do these things for her. Faraz is enough to take care of her.
[16:37] Send my tea to my room.
[16:42] Such a lackey!
[16:49] Mahnoor... don't take what I say the wrong way.
[16:53] Her household's state is in front of you to see. We don't have servants like you do at your home...
[17:00] We only have a cleaning lady that comes, apart from that whatever happens throughout the day...
[17:06] we have to do is ourselves and...
[17:10] Aima already has a lot of responsibilities at home, on top of her studies.
[17:14] So don't ask her to do things for you.
[17:19] It would be better if you take on some responsibility at home and help Aima with the housework.
[18:12] Her hands aren't covered with henna which is stopping her from working. I'm warning you...
[18:19] Faraz is enough to take care of her.
[18:25] Sister...
Your tea.
[18:40] Sister, can I request something? Don't tell brother Faraz what mother said to you, he'll be very upset to hear it.
[18:47] I'll try to tell mother not to say such things. She doesn't have a bad heart...
[18:53] she's just upset by what happened yesterday.
[18:57] I promise that there will be a change in her behavior...
[19:01] and she will realize her mistake as well. Just don't say anything to him, please.
[19:45] How was your day today?
[19:52] I just remembered that I had a lot of missed calls from you today.
[19:57] Actually, I was busy in a meeting, so I switched off my phone. I forgot to turn it back on.
[20:04] There's a lot to do.
Didn't you go to Hyderabad today?
[20:10] I thought that you would go there and stay the night.
[20:15] No, I was here... but you don't seem well to me.
[20:21] Why the long face? Did you argue with your mother or Mahnoor?
I called you several times.
[20:30] Your number was turned off, I called you at the office. You weren't there.
[20:37] When I asked for the number of your Hyderabad office I learned...
[20:42] that you have no office in Hyderabad.
[20:56] For the past two years...
[20:59] you've stayed out many nights. Where did you go and why did you lie to me?
[21:09] You're calling me a liar? If the receptionist at my office told me that there was no office in Hyderabad, does that make me a liar?
[21:19] Calling my place of work inquiring about me was very low of you.
[21:25] Did you feel no shame doing this?
You're the one who was lying to me...
[21:33] You should be the one who should feel ashamed.
[21:35] Areeba have you gone insane? You were always illiterate, but now you've grown disrespectful as well.
[21:42] Do you think I'll have to go to Hyderabad to deceive you? You don't believe me that I have an office in Hyderabad, right?
[21:47] Come with me, I'll give you the number as well.
I don't want to go anywhere.
[21:51] You don't believe me, right? Come with me and see the Hyderabad office yourself.
[21:56] Why did the receptionist at your work say that you had no office in Hyderabad?
[22:00] You foolish woman, she doesn't know about the Hyderabad office. It's a partnership that I have with my friend. It's not like my branch in Karachi.
[22:12] If the receptionist told you that there is no office in Hyderabad, you started suspecting me.
[22:17] What's the matter with you? I work day and night to give you a comfortable life and you're questioning me?
[22:24] I feel ashamed of myself.
[23:05] Listen.
[23:09] What more do you want to tell me? Is there anything left?
[23:17] I'm sorry... I made a mistake. Anyone else in my place would have...
[23:23] done the same thing.
Would they have said that I was a liar?
[23:28] Is this how you repay me for being with you for so many years? You took no time in calling me a liar.
[23:37] I deserve this... 
[23:42] Aunt Irham was right when she said that I wouldn't be repaid for my kindness. You have hurt me today.
[23:51] For so many years, forget about asking for a child.. let alone complaining about it.
[23:56] I didn't want to hurt you.
[24:01] And you, in a moment call me every name under the sun.
[24:06] Alright then... if I don't come home at night then I must go to some woman at night.
[24:17] Go away from here.
No, listen to me...
[24:21] I don't want to hear a thing... are you leaving or should I?
No, don't go anywhere...
[24:30] I'll leave.
[24:46] I will teach that receptionist a lesson today! I won't let her get away with this.
[25:13] What are you doing so early in the kitchen today?
I'm making breakfast for everyone.
[25:18] For what? There's no need for you to do this.
[25:22] Why? Is this not my home?
[25:26] It is
Then why are you objecting to me making breakfast?
[25:33] What need was there for you to come inside the kitchen?
It's not about any need, it was about my habits.
[25:42] I've always had a habit of doing my own work. Not only mine Ramsha's as well.
[25:52] I make an amazing omelet. If you want I can help you out.
[25:59] Forget it...
Go and sit with your mother, I'll be right there with breakfast.
[26:09] Is the bread burning?
Oh shit!
[27:28] Faraz...
Yes, mother?
[27:32] What were you doing in the kitchen?
[27:35] Mahnoor is inside, that's why I went there.
[27:39] Alright... come and sit. I need to talk to you.
[27:52] Yes mother, what is it? Is everything alright?
Yes, it is.
[27:57] I'll be getting my committee money.
[28:02] I'll be getting it in a few days. It was for two lacs.
[28:08] I was thinking of having gold bangles made for Aima.
[28:13] But nowadays, the way gold is rising...
[28:19] If you could give me one lac... if not then sixty, or seventy thousand will suffice as well.
[28:27] Then I'll have enough to make bangles for Aima.
[28:33] One lacs? Yes, my dear...
[28:38] It will relieve some of my worries. I've decided to marry off Aima...
[28:46] I pray that we find a good suitor for her.
[28:51] We did find one... anyways...
[28:57] Mother, I don't have so much money right now. A lot was spent on the wedding and next month...
[29:03] I have to pay Wahir's fees as well. I think that's important.
[29:11] Alright... wait for a few months, I'll give you more than you're asking me.
[29:18] Then you can buy something else as well.
[29:21] Alright my dear, as you wish. May God bless you.
[29:26] Auntie, here's your tea.
Bless you.
[29:30] This is yours.
Thank you.
[29:32] The breakfast will be ready in ten minutes. Wake up Aima and Wahir as well.
[29:38] Sure.
[29:51] The watch is amazing!
[29:56] Who gave it to you?
It must be one of his many fan girls.
[30:01] Men empty out their pockets. We take them out to lunches... wish them happy birthdays...
[30:09] and still, girls pay no heed.
On the other hand, there's this guy...
[30:14] Everyone has their charm.
[30:18] I know very well what a girl likes and doesn't like.
[30:25] I've told you many times not to follow these girls around, but you don't listen to me.
[30:33] And yes...
[30:36] My girlfriend didn't gift me this watch...
[30:41] my sister-in-law gifted it to me.
[30:46] Amazing!
[30:58] Hello...
Brother Faraz...
[31:02] Yes, who are you?
[31:04] It's me Ramsha...
[31:07] Ramsha, I didn't recognize your voice.
It's okay, that happens sometimes.
[31:13] Why did you call me? How are you, how's your mother?
[31:16] I'm fine, mother is well, too.
[31:21] Brother Faraz, I wanted to talk to you.
[31:25] Is sister Mahnoor near you?
No, she must be in the kitchen with Aima. Do you want me to call her?
[31:31] No... tomorrow is sister Mahnoor's birthday and I want to plan a surprise for her.
[31:39] That's why I want you to bring her to her home. We'll arrange everything right here.
[31:45] You and your family are invited. Don't let sister Mahnoor find out otherwise...
Done...
[31:51] All of us will be there. If you need any help, be sure to let me know.
[31:58] Everything is sorted, and all of you have to be there on time. Just one request, don't let sister Mahnoor find out.
[32:05] Alright... done... take care.... I'll see you soon.
[32:10] Okay... farewell.
[32:14] Who were you talking about meeting?
[32:23] It was my friend. It had been a while since we met and he was complaining.
[32:29] He has invited us tomorrow at his home for dinner.
[32:34] Oh, I see... I forwarded you a mail. Did you take a look?
[32:40] Checking it right now.
Check it and then tell me.
[32:59] Hi Mahir...
[33:13] Hi!
[33:16] Why didn't you come to the university yesterday?
My mother wasn't feeling well, that's why I stayed home.
[33:24] How is she feeling now?
[33:28] She's better now. I wanted to invite you.
[33:32] Tomorrow is sister Mahnoor's birthday.
Really?
[33:35] Yeah, so I've planned a surprise for her.
[33:38] I've already invited my brother Faraz. I asked him to bring the entire family, but...
[33:44] I wanted to invite you personally...
[33:48] so, will you be there?
Sure why not?
[33:51] It's sister Mahnoor's birthday... how can I miss that?
[33:57] I will be there.
Okay then, see you.
[34:00] Bye.
[34:12] You got a gift from your sister-in-law, but it seems soon you'll be getting a gift from her sister.
[35:04] What is the matter? Why are you calling me constantly? If I'm not picking up then that means that I'm busy.
[35:11] I'm so sorry... I thought you weren't picking up because you were mad at me.
[35:18] I'm not mad at you. Even after the vile accusations...
That's why I'm apologizing to you.
[35:26] I had a misunderstanding, please forgive me.
[35:31] Alright fine... we'll talk about this when I come home.
[35:35] Let me work right now.
Alright.
[35:38] Will you come home early today?
Yes, I will now don't disturb me. I'm working.
[35:48] Sure... take your time. Farewell.
[36:03] Anger makes people commit mistakes. And I said so many things to Saqlain out of anger.
[36:15] Thank God that he forgave me, otherwise I had made a great mistake.
[36:30] It seems that Areeba has become suspicious. A scene was created at home yesterday. It was hard for me to control it.
[36:38] I'm shocked at you. Why do you cut a barren woman so much slack?
[36:43] What are you saying? She's my wife and I don't want her to know anything about you.
[36:52] Alright, then leave me and live a happy life with your wife.
This is no place to create a scene. Sit down.
[37:01] Sit down.
[37:09] When will you marry me?
[37:13] What's with you? I don't know how to make you understand...
I don't want to understand.
[37:20] Nor, do I want to be convinced by you.
[37:24] Soon, you'll have to make a decision, before my mother does.
[37:30] Saqlain I fear losing you. How can I make you understand that?
