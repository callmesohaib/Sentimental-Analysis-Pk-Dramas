[01:11] Mahir, listen to me.
What's your problem? Why are you following me?
[01:18] What's the matter with you? I didn't say anything to you, why are you talking to me like that?
[01:25] Mahir, listen to me.
[01:28] If I hadn't gone to your home with you that day, then sister Mahnoor wouldn't have seen me.
[01:33] That's why I'm asking you to stay away from me.
[01:38] And live your life according to your family. I've never heard someone say so much to me like your sister did that day.
[01:47] Listen to me. What's wrong with you? I didn't say a word to you, then why are you doing this to me?
[01:58] What did she want to tell you? That you can't live that lifestyle with me.
[02:03] Am I a thug?
[02:06] Ramsha remember one thing. You are the one who followed me. You are the one who initiated our friendship.
[02:12] You know what, a girl like you isn't of my standard.
[02:30] Hi Mahir...
Oh hi
[02:33] What happened? Why are you fighting with her?
[02:37] My mood got ruined because of an idiot. Anyways, how are you?
[02:42] What's going on?
My dad gifted me a car, I wanted to take it out on a drive with you.
[02:52] Sure... why not? Come on.
[03:19] People like you can never let their sisters be happy.
[03:24] You tried doing the same thing with sister Areeba. You tried so many times to destroy her home.
[03:31] Thank God that mother was there to control you.
[03:36] Otherwise, you would have destroyed sister's home.
What's the matter with you?
[03:40] Where are you taking things?
I'm right.
[03:46] You praise brother Faraz a lot. But now, when it has come to his brother, you don't think he's a nice guy. Why?
[03:54] Because I like her.
Lower your voice, mother will hear.
[03:58] He has ended our friendship as well.
That's great.
[04:04] I wanted that man to go far away from you.
He insulted me in front of his friends.
[04:11] He said bad things to me. I will never forgive you and I will never talk to you.
[04:17] Never... get out of my way!
Ramsha!
[04:26] What's wrong with her? Why was she crying?
[04:30] It's nothing. A few of her friends are going on a field trip...
[04:36] she was asking me to talk to mother to give her permission.
[04:39] I refused, that's why she's upset.
She's gone insane.
[04:44] Does she think that she'll put forth any demand and we'll accept it? Before she takes mother's permission, she'll need to take Saqlain's permission.
[04:53] You know that he'll not let her go on any trip.
[04:58] Anyways, forget her. She'll be fine after a while. She's angry right now.
[05:05] Let's go to the doctor. Get ready.
[05:08] I came from home because mother specifically asked me if I'll need to go to the doctor with you.
[05:13] We're going to the doctor's.
Pray that this doctor has a treatment for me.
[05:19] God willing everything will be fine.
[05:23] Let's go.
[05:34] Fariya, how much more will I have to wait?
[05:38] You told me that you will decide on this case fast and take a divorce.
[05:43] How much more time will you take?
Ramiz, I'm not wasting time.
[05:48] I'm just waiting for the right time.
When will that right time come?
[05:55] As soon as you take a divorce, the sooner we'll marry.
If Saqlain finds out about us...
[06:01] then he will never let me go so easily.
[06:05] He has a lot of money...
[06:09] you have nothing. How will you compete with him?
[06:16] What if he decides to put a halt to things? The lawyer fees alone...
[06:22] How will we manage all this?
[06:27] Saqlain has caused me much pain and in return, I want to give him so much pain...
[06:34] that he remembers it for the rest of his life.
How will you do that?
[06:37] You're the one who told me that he's very powerful.
Every powerful man has his weakness.
[06:44] And Saqlain's weakness is his money.
[06:49] This is the money that he's looting from his wife and her family. I want to steal that money from him.
[06:57] Ramiz... I'm not being greedy. If I were I would have been living happily with him.
[07:04] You think all of this is very easy. He's a smart man, and on top of that, he knows how to trap people.
[07:09] There's no point in fighting a case like that, he won't give you a thing.
We'll have to compel him to do this.
[07:18] And if I take a divorce from him...
[07:20] then he will steal my dower from me. How will we live then?
[07:25] What will we have to do then?
[07:28] We'll have to wait and you'll have to listen to me.
[07:35] Understand?
I will listen to everything you say Fariya...
[07:39] Just rid yourself of Saqlain...
[07:44] We'll leave this country and we'll lead a good life.
[07:49] Fariya... Saqlain is outside... he's standing outside.
[07:57] Do one thing.... stay in your room, don't come out. You too.
[08:02] I'll handle Saqlain downstairs. Lock the door.
[08:17] What happened to you? Why are you limping?
I was on my way to open the door for you...
[08:22] Coming out from the lounge I crashed into the side of the table.
[08:27] My foot is in pain.
[08:29] I hope it hasn't fractured. Let me take you to the doctor.
[08:33] Take me to the hospital.
Where's your mother?
[08:37] She went out to get groceries.
Come on... be careful.
[08:43] Be careful.
[08:52] All of your reports are old. None of them are new.
[08:57] You have to get new tests done.
[09:01] We need your husband's reports as well, only then we can move forward.
[09:08] Doctor...
[09:11] is there any chance?
We're not considering these reports.
[09:15] According to them, there is not much home. But no matter how advanced science gets...
[09:21] there is always a limit to it. And where that limit ends, starts the mercy of God.
[09:28] These past few years you have been treated in a basic manner.
[09:32] We'll take a new test and move forward. God willing, we'll be successful.
[09:51] My God, she's late.
[09:56] I think they would have left by now.
[10:00] Alright, I'll get going then.
Where are you going? Saqlain might be still there.
[10:06] Let me check, and then I'll let you know.
[10:21] They have left, and the field is clear. Go ahead.
[10:27] Fariya will have us all killed. She calls him here every day.
[10:39] I think she's alright. There's no need for an X-ray because there is no swelling on her ankle.
[10:44] She's in a lot of pain. Have her X-ray done, just as a precaution.
[10:48] I'll have her X-ray done because you're insisting upon it. But I'm sure that it's nothing.
[10:55] At the very most it's a sprain. The painkiller will fix it, and on top of that, we've given her an injection.
[11:02] Alright, as you wish.
[11:04] Staff, take her to the x-ray room.
No, it's alright.
[11:08] Are you still in pain?
No Saqlain...
[11:12] she just gave me the injection, the pain is coming down.
[11:17] Forget the x-ray. The doctor said that there is no need for an x-ray.
[11:23] But Fariya...
Saqlain please, let's go home, I'm much better now.
[11:28] I'll bring a wheelchair for you.
There's no need. My pain is coming down.
[11:34] Alright, bandage her. There's no need for an x-ray.
[11:41] Alright, stay here for a while. I'll meet the doctor, pay the bills and then we can go home.
[11:47] Alright.
[12:03] Ma'am, we can give you a time till next week.
Will her reports be back by next week?
[12:08] Yes, they will.
Alright then, give us an appointment for next week.
[12:21] Sister Areeba, how did you feel talking to the doctor? Did you feel satisfied?
[12:29] I don't know Mahnoor. All the doctors say similar things in the beginning...
[12:58] Sister Areeba...
[13:04] What happened?
I just saw brother Saqlain passing by, did you see him?
[13:11] How can Saqlain come here?
He just went by here, let's go ask him what he's doing here.
[13:18] Sure.. come on.
[13:37] You... here?
[13:41] What are you two doing here?
I told you that I had a doctor's appointment here today.
[13:47] Yes, I forgot, otherwise I wouldn't have come here...
[13:51] That's fine... but what are you doing here? Is everything alright?
[13:55] I was in an accident...
[14:01] What happened to you? Are you fine?
I'm fine... there's no need to worry.
[14:08] Thank God...
There was a guy who came in front of my car and I brought him here.
[14:14] Is he fine? Is it a big problem?
[14:17] No, thank God that everything is fine.
Sir...
[14:21] These are your payment slips, your dues have been cleared. We have bandaged them, you can take them away now.
[14:29] Thank God that this got resolved. I was worried that this might become a police case.
[14:34] Thank God that didn't happen.
[14:41] Anyways, go and meet the doctor.
We are free and were on our way home.
[14:48] Sister Areeba, I'll leave for work and you can go home with brother Saqlain.
[14:53] Brother Saqlain you'll take her home, right?
[15:04] Sure, you can go. You've already given me a lot of time. You must be running late.
[15:10] I'll go with him.
Sure, why not?
[15:14] Alright fine... I'll get going... remember one thing...
[15:20] You don't need to stress about anything and you need to be very careful.
[15:25] Shall we?
[15:28] What are you thinking?
I was just thinking about how he would go home.
[15:32] Will you drop him home? You brought him here, and got him treated, what else will you do for him?
[15:40] Forget about it. Come on, let's go home.
You're right. I've done what I came here for.
[15:45] Come on, I'll drop you off.
Let's go.
[15:48] Farewell*
[16:23] You're back... where's Saqlain?
[16:26] Did he drop you off at the door?
[16:30] He scared the life out of me coming here out of the blue. We were saved by the skin of our teeth.
[16:36] Forget all that... and pay for the taxi outside.
[16:41] Taxi.. you came here in a taxi?
Yes...
[16:45] But you went out with Saqlain, why a taxi?
He met his wife Areeba in the hospital...
[16:51] he left me to go with her.
What?
[16:55] Did he leave you at the hospital for her?
That's the worth I have for him.
[17:01] Am I not his wife? He acknowledged her as his wife in front of the entire world...
[17:07] and he asks me not to come in front of anyone else.
Why are you causing yourself anguish?
[17:14] It's not like you wanted to maintain a marriage with him. You'll leave him in the end. Let me get you some water, and after that, I'll pay for the taxi.
[18:06] Do you know the doctor is great, she said that we shouldn't be disappointed.
[18:13] There's nothing greater than God's mercy.
[18:24] Are you not happy?
[18:28] If that does happen, do you think that there is anyone who will be happier than me?
[18:36] We have been without hope for so many years...
But...
[18:41] I have gained hope again. God will bless with a child.
[18:48] We need not lose hope.
[18:54] I wish that's true.
[19:11] I'm leaving outside because of something important...
[19:14] If I'm late, then don't be worried.
[19:25] Sure.
[19:27] Coat?
Sure...
[20:57] This is a matter of Aima's entire life.
[21:01] I don't think we shouldn't have been hasty.
What's wrong with this proposal? He's an educated man with a good job.
[21:11] Did you see how big their house was?
[21:15] Yes, mother but...
[21:18] Thank you... We didn't have them investigated. We don't know anything about him.
[21:25] My dear, what need is there?
[21:30] There is no need to ask. The one who found the proposal did all of their investigations.
[21:37] You're worrying for no reason.
[21:44] Do you think that I'm such a fool that I will marry my daughter to just anyone?
[21:51] No mother...
[21:55] What can I say if you're satisfied?
[22:07] Yes... they are in a rush to get them married.
[22:14] We need to prepare accordingly after the engagement.
[22:21] Will it be hard for you?
[22:26] No.
[22:28] God willing, everything will be great. Prepare for the engagement and tell me if you need anything.
[22:48] We need to prepare a guest list. We also need to see if we'll host the engagement party at home or at a venue.
[22:57] Mahir... what's with you? You said what you wanted to. I apologized to you as well.
[23:05] Why are you blaming me for something sister Mahnoor did?
[23:09] You know that I... hello...
[23:14] Hello... hello!
[23:19] Ramsha... my dear...
[23:24] What's with you? Why are you crying?
[23:27] What happened? Tell me...
[23:31] Girls who have sisters like sister Mahnoor do nothing but cry...
But Mahnoor always...
[23:41] What did she just say?
[23:46] Why is she crying because of Mahi?
[23:54] Enough now... why are you being so unkind to that poor girl?
[24:01] Don't you know how he works? He uses his attitude to make girls do his bidding.
[24:08] I don't care about her. Besides she's my sister-in-law's sister.
[24:15] She has already insulted me.
You've done the same to her at university.
[24:24] Yes...
She's desperate to be with you. Why don't you think of marrying her?
[24:32] Really? Marriage?
[24:35] What's so great about her that I will marry her?
She's rich...
[24:41] Your future will be secured.
If I wanted to do that...
[24:47] then Arooba was a better option than her.
What if you lose Arooba?
[24:52] Listen to me, keep her under your thumb as well. If she becomes adamant about her demand then what will your sister-in-law be able to do?
[25:00] Think about that.
[25:07] Now order!
[25:09] Waiter!
What's the matter? Why are you crying?
[25:16] What's the matter?
Mother is being unjust to me.
[25:22] She asked me to get engaged right now and then I can marry later...
[25:27] I want to further my studies and I was about to talk to my brother about my university studies.
[25:34] Look... Faraz did talk to her, but she has decided.
[25:40] Sister... please help me.
[25:45] I'm not mentally ready for this marriage. And when one isn't mentally ready for something, there's no point in doing such a thing.
[25:52] I understand all of that. But how can I help you?
[25:56] You know that auntie won't listen to me.
[26:04] Talk to Yasir.
[26:07] Me?
Yes, you... ask Yasir to only do the engagement right now...
[26:11] we can marry after graduation as well.
[26:15] No...
Sister, please...
[26:19] I'm asking you to do something for the first time. Please help me.
[26:33] Alright fine, don't worry.
[26:36] We'll find a solution. I'll do something. Stop crying.
[26:41] Everything will be fine.
[27:00] Fariya, I know that I was wrong to do that to you.
[27:09] But... I found Areeba at the hospital if she had known...
[27:16] What would have happened? Would the sky have fallen?
[27:20] Try and understand, I can't tell Areeba about us right now.
[27:27] Saqlain I'm your wife as well. How long will you be unjust to me because of Areeba?
[27:34] Be patient for a little while longer. You wanted me to marry you and I did.
[27:41] You should use that to calm yourself down.
It would have been better if you hadn't married me.
[27:46] Look how you left me alone at the hospital to leave with Areeba.
[27:52] I was forced to. I forgot that Areeba was at that hospital, otherwise, I would have taken you to a different hospital.
[27:59] Saqlain how long will I listen to your compulsions?
[28:04] Did you see how Areeba stood there with her right?
[28:08] And I... I live like a thief. To this day, you haven't introduced me to your family or any one of your friends.
[28:18] What's the point in such a marriage, where I can't hold your hand?
[28:23] These are just shackles at my feet.
Saqlain...
[28:30] My dear, Fariya is right. You were cruel to my daughter today.
[28:35] Look at how she came back with a swollen foot in a taxi.
[28:41] The sight of her terrified me.
[28:43] I promise you that this will not happen again.
[28:49] Don't promise me anything.
[28:53] Divorce Areeba right now and give me my right.
[29:05] Only then I will believe you.
What's the matter with you?
[29:10] Try and understand. I can't divorce Areeba right now.
[29:15] Years of hard work will be laid to waste.
[29:19] It will be very problematic if Areeba and her family know that I've married you.
[29:25] Fifty percent of the work is done, and fifty percent is left.
[29:31] Be patient for a while... like you did before.
[29:47] My dear, why are you causing yourself pain? He's assuring you that everything will be fine.
[29:52] I'll make tea for you two.
[30:09] Please help me, I'm not mentally ready for this marriage And when one isn't mentally ready for something, there's no point in doing such a thing.
[30:35] Actually... this shirt was very old, that's why I didn't sew the button on it. I went to the market to shop...
[30:45] and I bought some new shirts for you...
[30:57] What need was there for them?
Yes, there was...
[31:02] You take such good care of us. You take care of our needs.
[31:07] But you don't take care of yourself at all. I haven't seen you shop for yourself.
[31:14] So...
[31:20] It's not like that. But thank you. I shop for myself when I need it.
[31:27] I have a lot of clothes and they are enough for me.
It's good to be humble.
[31:32] But... one shouldn't be so humble that one ignores oneself, allowing everyone to go ahead.
[31:40] Don't ignore yourself. You're special as well.
[31:45] And... for me, you are the most.
[32:00] I hope you like them.
[32:04] Yes, they are very nice, this is my favorite color.
[32:12] Can you please hold this?
[32:26] It's very nice.
[32:34] Nice, how do you know my size?
[32:37] I saw it on one of your shirts.
[32:44] You look good.
[33:20] I'm asking you something for the first time. Please, help me.
[33:47] Hello...
Greetings... is this Yasir speaking?
[33:51] Yes, and you are?
[33:53] Yasir, this is Mahnoor.
[33:56] You came to our home that day. I'm Aima's sister-in-law.
[33:59] Oh... okay... now I get it.
[34:03] How are you?
I'm fine and how are you?
[34:06] I'm good.
[34:08] Actually, I needed to talk to you.
Yes, I do. Please tell me what's on your mind.
[34:17] The thing is that Aima wants to complete her studies first.
[34:22] She isn't mentally prepared for this marriage.
Is she refusing to marry?
[34:29] Meaning...
It's not like that. She just wants time until her graduation.
[34:36] Actually, auntie said that she wants to get her married soon.
[34:40] That's why she was stressed out. She was worried that her studies would be abandoned this way.
[34:46] That's it.
It's nothing major...
[34:50] Aima can complete her studies after our marriage. I won't have any objections.
[34:55] But, if she's not ready right now, then we should give her some time. I'll ask mother not to discuss the wedding too much.
[35:02] We'll think about the wedding after we get engaged.
[35:06] Thank you so much brother Yasir for understanding me. Aima will be glad to hear this.
[35:12] I really appreciate it. We just need time until her studies are complete.
[35:17] Okay... no problem.
Thank you, farewell.
[35:50] What's the matter Ramsha? I've been noticing that you always have a long face.
[35:57] What's the problem?
[36:00] Nothing... brother Saqlain.
[36:07] There is something. She gets upset over every small thing.
[36:14] She's gotten used to having her way in everything.
[36:22] What is it that she wants to have fulfilled that I'm not aware of?
[36:27] Greetings*How are you mother?
I'm fine my dear, how are you?
[36:33] I'm fine as well. Sister Areeba... brother Saqlain, how are you two?
We're fine as well, you tell us...
[36:44] Mahi, come sit here, I want to talk to you.
Sure...
[36:51] Ramsha only had a long face up till now, but seeing you she left. That too, without greeting you.
[37:00] I think that she fought with you.
[37:06] No... why would she fight with me? It's nothing like that.
[37:13] Mahi, Ramsha was crying all night. First I thought that I should call you...
[37:20] then I decided that I'll talk to you when you visit me.
[37:24] Did you two argue about something?
[37:28] Tell me... what are you two hiding from me?
[37:32] Mother, what is there to hide from you? There's no fight between us.
[37:37] You told me that she spends money carelessly, I scolded her on that, and that's why she's upset.
[37:47] If it's like that, then she should be the one who should be ashamed. It's hard to earn money and where does she spend all that money?
[37:55] Maybe at university.
Mahnoor I know you defend Ramsha more than necessary.
[38:02] But... this might make her get out of control.
[38:06] That can't be, she's our sister and I know her limits.
[38:11] Besides, I've never taken her side when she was wrong.
[38:16] She's a little upset, I'll talk to her about it, then she'll be fine.
