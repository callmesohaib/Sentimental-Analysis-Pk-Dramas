[02:08] Mahnoor, isn't there a lot of age difference between him and Ramsha?
[02:15] I never wanted this marriage to happen. But brother Saqlain and sister Areeba...
[02:20] they didn't give us any other option.
[02:32] Wait a minute... Faraz... Mahnoor... come, we're starting the wedding ceremony.
[02:54] How much dower should I write?
[02:58] Saqlain, how much should I write?
[03:03] Whatever you want.
[03:11] Ten lacs.
[03:29] How much dower should I write?
[03:34] Ten lacs.
[03:49] The dower should be at least ten lacs, right brother Saqlain?
[04:10] Write twenty lacs.
[04:39] Do you want me to write something else?
[07:46] Hamza...
[07:55] Sister, this is for you.
[08:02] Keep it.
[08:07] Mahnoor this is for you.
I can't take this.
[08:17] Why not? This is the ritual.
[08:20] Yes... it is.
[08:24] But still, I can't take it. Because this is too much.
[08:30] Besides, sister Areeba is the one who conducted the ritual...
[08:35] and you've already given her the gift.
[08:48] If you want to give me something...
[08:52] then promise me something.
[09:00] That you will take good care of Ramsha.
[09:07] That you will always keep her happy.
[09:18] If you promise me this, then I'll think that you've given me a gift.
[09:34] I will do that but still...
[09:44] Brother Tawqir if Mahnoor doesn't want to take the gift, then there is no reason to insist.
[10:00] Alright.
[10:05] With your permission, I'd like to have dinner served, after that, the sending-off ceremony can start.
[10:14] Sure.
[10:44] Yes, brother Tawqir?
What is the matter Saqlain?
[10:48] No one seems happy with this wedding. Neither Mahnoor... nor Ramsha...
[10:54] nor Mahnoor's husband.
Forget about it for now, I'll explain it to you later.
[11:01] Just remember that I've respected your wishes. You wanted Ramsha and now she's yours. She'll stay happy if you keep her happy.
[11:12] Ramsha is like my little sister. If she ever makes a mistake, then I apologize.
[11:22] What are you doing... I will try to take care of Ramsha as you all do in this home.
[11:31] I won't give you or her any chance to complain. I promise you that.
[11:37] Thank you very much.*
Please come...
[12:02] Did you see the attitude of both of your sisters?
[12:07] I wonder where they find the nerve to act like this after the blunders they've made.
[12:10] Ramsha ran away from home and spent the entire night out with a boy. Even then, I sent her away respectfully today.
[12:22] Otherwise, this stain would have remained with her for the remainder of her life.
[12:27] Now tell me, who would have married a girl like her?
[12:34] I know that brother Tawqir is no less than an angel for us.
[12:39] It is like that. You were there when Mahnoor demanded the dower.
[12:47] For a sister who had run away from home. Did she feel no shame?
[12:54] Brother Tawqir answered her well, by having the dower written twenty lacs, instead of ten.
[13:03] It seems that she is jealous of Tawqir.
[13:07] She is jealous that Ramsha got married to a well-cultured and wealthy man...
[13:13] Maybe she's comparing her husband to brother Tawqir.
[13:21] Anyways, to hell with her. It was my responsibility to get your sister married to a responsible man.
[13:31] That has been done today and that is enough for me.
Thank you very much Saqlain.
[13:36] All of this has happened because of you...
[13:40] Why are you crying?
[13:44] Today is a day of celebration. Auntie would have been so happy today.
[13:52] Stop crying, please.
[14:06] Should we return to our home tomorrow?
[14:10] Tomorrow?
Yes... you said...
[14:14] that after Ramsha's wedding, we'll go back to our home.
[14:19] What is your problem? Why are you in a rush to go back to your home?
[14:27] She just got married and went to her home. It's not like this house has become a burden on the Earth.
[14:32] God forbid.
[14:36] Think about it. If we leave this house, and someone takes over it, it will become a problem for me. Then what will we do?
[14:44] Yes... you're right.
[14:49] Be patient for a few days. We'll think about it. Your sister just left, let me have a few days of peace.
[14:58] Pray that your sister settles down in that house. I have an old relationship with brother Tawqir, I don't want it to get ruined because of your sister.
[15:07] I hope I do not get embarrassed in front of him.
[15:20] Will I get some green tea? I think I overate at the wedding.
[15:41] I'll send you to your home, you'll stay there.
[15:47] You will go nowhere, we'll stay here now.
[16:04] Is the wedding over?
[16:08] Yes...
[16:11] Thank God... everything went well.
[16:19] What's with you? Why are you silent? Did you argue with Saqlain?
[16:25] No...
Then what?
[16:31] It's nothing...
[16:42] All of this happened because of you.
[16:46] You ruined an innocent girl's life. If you hadn't provoked her to run away with you then today...
[16:55] she wouldn't be stuck in a relationship like this.
[17:02] Why? Who did they marry her to? Is that man not good? Were they not careful in selecting him?
[17:10] Was this a situation where they should have been careful in choosing her suitor?
[17:18] But still...
He's older than her... he might be a millionaire...
[17:26] but it didn't feel right to me when I met him.
[17:31] I didn't see respect in his eyes for Ramsha. But still, I pray that she stays happy in her life.
[17:41] But if that doesn't happen, then you will be the one to blame for this...
[18:13] This is your new home.
[18:29] Sajda...
[18:34] Take miss Ramsha to her room.
[18:40] Ramsha if you need anything then ask Sajda...
[20:08] Do you want something?
[20:13] My name is Sajda, if you need anything, let me know about it.
[20:22] Sir will be here any moment.
[21:22] He's older than her... he might be a millionaire, but it didn't feel right to me when I met him.
[21:28] I didn't see respect in his eyes for Ramsha, but still, I pray that she stays happy in her life.
[21:40] But if that doesn't happen, then you'll be the one to blame for this...
[22:01] How is my dear child?
[22:03] Yes... why are you getting worried?
[22:08] It's not like this is the first time I've been out of the city.
[22:12] I have work to do, I'll come back as soon as it's over. I promise.
[22:19] Let me talk to your mother.
[22:24] Yes... why is she crying?
[22:28] Make her understand. Tell her that I'll come back, it's not like this is my first time being out for business.
[22:35] Sure...
[22:38] Hey, champ! How are you? How's your new Xbox? Very good.
[22:47] I'll see you soon. I'll call you.
[22:52] Okay, bye.
[23:20] At least wear your shoes...
I'm fine like this.
[23:27] Okay...
Farewell*
[23:35] Oh my! Where did you get this ring from?
[23:39] It seems very expensive. Who gave this to you, please tell me.
[24:02] Mahnoor... 
[24:11] She didn't even meet me before going.
[24:15] She's upset with me.
[24:19] Everything will be alright.
[24:22] She had a lot of hope...
[24:28] She had hoped that I'll help her.
[24:33] But I didn't help her.
[24:37] At that time you and I were helpless... we couldn't have done anything.
[24:45] I feel very ashamed and helpless right now.
[24:50] You too think that this isn't right.
[24:55] Sister Areeba and Saqlain are impressed by his wealth...
[25:02] Did you notice one thing... there were none of his family friends involved. He was there with a few of his friends.
[25:13] Only through one's family can one know what type of person one really is.
[25:22] When older men marry do they have no one from their family...
[25:27] Do they not want to involve themselves?
[25:36] When I went to their home, Tawqir was alone, he only had his servants. I asked brother Saqlain...
[25:46] Saqlain doesn't care about anything else. He behaves like his lackey.
[25:53] I've never heard him talk in this tone before.
[26:01] Still...
[26:04] We can't do anything.
[26:10] I'll call Ramsha and ask her if she's alright.
[26:14] Don't call her now, it's late.
[26:18] But Faraz...
You can talk to her tomorrow. Rather you can meet her.
[26:22] It's possible that by tomorrow morning her anger has lessened.
[26:59] I'm very angry, I'm ordering pizza... do you want some?
No, you can order for yourself.
[27:07] Alright...
I don't have money, give me some.
[27:12] Sure... take it from my purse
[28:09] Hey...
[28:12] You're crying? Why?
[28:17] Relax.
[28:22] What is the matter?
[28:30] You're afraid, there's nothing to be afraid of.
[28:38] Girls are very happy when they get married. Why aren't you happy?
[28:45] Alright fine... look at this.
[28:50] I brought this gift for you.
[28:54] It was very expensive. Especially crafted for you.
[29:00] Look at this... wear it.
[29:09] Did you not like it?
[29:11] Alright, maybe you want to take a look at it later, or maybe you're nervous.
[29:18] It's alright... I'll keep this here. When you feel better, wear it.
[29:28] If you have a problem, let me know.
[29:31] I want to keep you very happy.
[29:36] Let me know if you need anything. I'll be gone for a few minutes...
[29:41] I'll be right back.
[29:45] Okay.
[30:24] Areeba, who's calling you so early in the morning?
[30:35] It's Mahnoor.
What does she want so early in the morning?
[30:40] She doesn't care if we're sleeping. All she cares about is herself.
[30:49] I don't know, let me ask her.
What's the point of educating oneself, if one has no respect?
[30:53] Don't ruin my sleep. Go outside and talk.
[31:03] Sure.
[31:14] What is the matter? Why have you called so early in the morning?
Sister Areeba did you give Ramsha her phone?
[31:21] Ramsha's phone?
I've been calling her for ages, but her phone is switched off.
[31:27] Because I have her phone.
[31:31] Sister Areeba, you should have given her, her phone. How will I talk to her now?
[31:37] Mahnoor, call brother Tawqir, it's not a big deal.
[31:41] Alright fine, send me his number. I want to talk to Ramsha, I want to ask her how she's doing.
[31:48] She is fine. We married her, we didn't imprison her. Don't worry.
[31:55] The way you had her married is no short of a punishment and unfortunately, I'm every bit as involved in this as you are.
[32:05] Anyways... send me the number... I want to talk to her.
[32:12] I'm sending you the number, satisfy yourself.
[32:18] But yes, don't call him so early in the morning. He must be sleeping.
[32:23] Saqlain was getting upset as well.
[32:53] Mahir...
[32:56] Yes, mother?
Where are you going?
[32:58] I'm going to my university.
[33:01] Where did you get this wound from?
It's nothing.
[33:05] No, it's not, it wasn't there last night. Did you apply something to it?
[33:09] Mother, it's nothing big. I applied medicine to it. I'm leaving.
[33:14] Why are you going there?
I've already taken a lot of days off and exams are near as well.
[33:20] I want to see the circumstances there and I have to prepare for it as well.
[33:24] Alright fine, go. Come back straight home from there, do not sit with your friends.
[33:28] Otherwise, I'll be worried sick.
Sure, I'll be back.
[33:31] Take care of yourself and have this wound dressed.
Sure mother, I will.
[33:40] Lord knows where Faraz went so early in the morning. He doesn't care about his brother, or us.
[33:47] Lord knows what he's up to.
[34:24] Hello.
[34:27] Greetings is this Mr. Tawqir...
[34:30] Yes, and you are? This is Mahnoor talking, Ramsha's sister.
[34:37] Yes, how are you?
[34:44] I'm completely fine, how is Ramsha? And how are you?
[34:50] We're fine... everything alright?
[34:56] I wanted to talk to Ramsha...
[35:00] Her phone is at home, so could you please make her talk to me?
[35:06] That's fine, I'll pass the phone to her.
[35:11] Ramsha, it's your sister Mahnoor's phone.
[35:21] Tell her that I'm busy somewhere and that I don't want to talk to her.
[35:40] Mahnoor her mood isn't well. You can call her later, she doesn't want to talk to you right now.
[35:58] Sure... alright.
[36:43] Were you able to talk to Ramsha?
[36:49] She doesn't want to talk to me.
[36:54] Let's go home and talk. Let's go and visit her.
[36:58] Faraz...
[37:01] Do you think it's appropriate visiting his house?
[37:06] What is inappropriate about it? We're just fulfilling an obligation that happens after the wedding.
[37:18] Meeting Ramsha will make you feel well and you can talk to her there as well.
[37:26] Let's go and not waste any more time.
[37:30] Okay.
[37:41] Mahir is here...
My man!
[37:46] How are you?
I was in the police station, where else?
[37:51] Hansa told me that the police arrested you and Ramsha.
You were still in that police station?
[37:58] Yes...
Listen... where's Ramsha.
[38:01] Is she still with you, or has her family found her?
[38:06] Do you know that the entire university knows that you and Ramsha ran off together?
[38:14] He looks upset.
Mahir...
[38:17] Listen to me, Mahir...
[38:38] You can have breakfast as well.
[38:49] Listen...
[38:53] Shouldn't we have taken breakfast for Ramsha and brother Tawqir today?
[38:58] Breakfast?
[39:01] You will take breakfast for brother Tawqir.
[39:06] Yes... it's a ritual.
[39:10] The bride's family always take breakfast for the groom.
[39:14] You've already completed all rituals at your sister's wedding. You married her off with great pageantry.
[39:22] We did all we could.
And who made you do all this?
[39:26] I asked you to, otherwise you and Mahnoor were standing on the sidelines.
[39:32] There is no point in taking breakfast. Brother Tawqir won't like it if we take breakfast to them, so early in the morning.
[39:42] I would have felt better if I had met Ramsha. Mahnoor was worried about her as well.
[39:48] She said that...
Have you imprisoned her?
[39:53] What has happened that you and Mahnoor are so concerned for her well-being?
[39:59] You just left yesterday...
[40:05] How can she turn back to you so soon?
