[01:43] Is anything left behind?
[01:46] Oh! The sweets are still here.
[01:50] Tell Maheer to place it in the car!
[01:52] Mother! it's getting late! Let's go.
[01:57] Let Faraz come! He is getting ready. Why are you in so much hurry?
[02:02] Brother is finally here.
[02:06] You look so nice!
[02:08] My son is looking so good.
[02:11] Looking like a prince.
[02:14] May god keep you safe from evil eye.
[02:16] I'll ask Maheer to place the sweets in car.
[02:21] I'm so happy.
[02:24] May god bless you with a good family.
[02:29] Are you happy son?
[02:30] Yes mother! I'm happy.
[02:32] You should be happy! This marriage is of your choice.
[02:36] If you are happy! I'm happy too.
[04:43] What about the brides gift?
[04:55] Brides gift?
[05:00] 1 million!
[05:16] Mahnoor's bridal gift is 1 million rupees.
[05:23] 1 million?
[05:27] 1 million is too much! We were thinking..
[05:30] You would be thinking of a cheap amount.
[05:33] But we don't accept that!
[05:42] That's why Mahnoor's bridal gift will be 1 million rupees. It's time!
[05:52] You are right! Bridal gift will be according to your demand. 1 million rupees.
[06:08] Right it! 1 million.
[06:10] 1 million.
[06:22] Hello!
[06:25] Hi!
[06:26] May I ask you that what are you doing here?
[06:32] I was here to ask the same that what are you doing here!
[06:36] Come on! It's my elder brother's wedding.
[06:40] Don't tell me! It's my sister's wedding.
[06:44] Really?
[06:45] Yeah! This means that my sister Mahnoor is marrying your elder brother Faraz?
[06:51] We were friends before but now we are family friends.
[06:55] That's such a good thing! Let's go on the stage. Nikkah is about to start.
[07:00] Sure! You go, I'll come.
[07:03] Make it quick.
[07:04] Fine.
[08:59] Quick! Take out the money. The money! Sister tell him about it.
[09:06] Yes sure!
[09:10] Maheer!
[09:18] Here!
[09:20] How much is this?
[09:25] This is just 5k! I need at least..
[09:27] 100k !
[09:40] Don't you remember that you and Mahnoor took 100k from me.
[09:45] If can't give it, then I'll give it to her.
[09:48] She demanded money from me. I'll be the one to give it to her.
[09:52] Se is asking 100k.
[09:54] She won't take less.
[09:56] You won't have such amount right now.
[10:03] Don't worry! I'll give it to her. Here! 100k.
[10:13] Here! Now drink this milk.
[11:46] Sister in law! Sit here on the couch.
[11:49] Why are you forcing her to sit here? Take her to the room of Faraz.
[11:55] Mother! Mahnoor has to eat the sweets and we have to enjoy the moments.
[12:00] It's already to late! This is not the time for such foolish acts.
[12:12] Take her in the room.
[12:14] Mahnoor would be tired too.
[12:19] Fine!
[12:38] Don't you think that you insulted Faraz a lot.
[12:45] Did I insult him? You think that was insult?
[12:49] I wanted to act as his friend! I gave the money from my own that was demanded from him.
[12:57] You should not have given the money.
[12:59] Because Rimsha didn't even demand 100k.
[13:05] She didn't demand a proper amount.
[13:08] She also knew that her demand won't be fulfilled by him.
[13:12] They would've felt bad about it! It might affect Mahnoor's presence in that house.
[13:17] Why are you so worried about Mahnoor? You were against this proposal like a week ago.
[13:22] Mahnoor didn't listen to you! She married Faraz by her own choice.
[13:26] You a right but she is married now, and we should not make some misunderstanding for them in the start of their marriage.
[13:34] It can drag some difficulties in the relation. You should think about it.
[13:39] Now you'll blame me just like Mahnoor did?
[13:42] It's fine.
[13:43] The family that you belong to, I should not expect anything but arrogance.
[13:48] I was just normally speaking.
[13:50] Don't say a word!
[13:53] I'm the one who was looking after the arrangements of your sister's wedding from so many days.
[13:57] And now that it has ended! You have started taunting me. Very nice.
[14:02] No! I'm not taunting. I was just speaking with you. Where are you going? I won't speak anymore.
[14:16] This is just 5k! I need at least..
[14:19] 100k! Don't you remember that you and Mahnoor took 100k from me?
[14:24] If you can't give it to her! I'll give her the money myself from your side.
[14:55] Faraz! I apologize for Saqlain's behavior.
[15:03] Leave the apologies to the side.
[15:09] Whatever he did and what was the intensity, I know it really well.
[15:13] You should not worry at all! You should forget about your worries from today because I'll handle them.
[15:22] I just want to see you happy and smiling.
[15:27] I promise you that I won't ever leave you alone.
[15:34] It's good.
[15:36] I'll be with you forever.
[16:41] Mother!
[16:45] Mother! What did you do?
[16:47] Who acts like this? You didn't even let her eat the sweets and she couldn't enjoy with me.
[16:52] I did alright.
[16:56] I myself reached home with so much negativity on my mind.
[17:03] The torture I went through and waited for the bridal departure.
[17:08] The disrespect we went through! We should have rejected the marriage on the spot and left her on the spot.
[17:19] This is wrong mother! You shouldn't talk like this.
[17:23] Whatever her brother in law did. Was that right?
[17:28] First he chose the bridal gift himself.
[17:32] And after that he insulted Faraz.
[17:36] What did Mahnoor do wrong in all of this?
[17:39] No! It's my fault that I listened to Faraz and brought her home a his bride.
[17:48] He is getting disrespected! And we are too.
[17:55] I said it! She didn't bring the dowry.
[18:00] There's no importance of dowry for them! But the bridal gift..
[18:06] They chose 1 million!
[18:09] Mother! Why are you getting mad?
[18:13] It's not the time for dowry anymore! People bring cash thee days.
[18:21] Didn't you see the wedding arrangements? It was worth millions.
[18:27] It was not for us! They wanted to show off.
[18:34] Whatever! I'm happy that Faraz got married to Mahnoor as she is so well educated.
[18:40] She is bank for us! She is the boss of Faraz in office. Why are you worrying about dowry?
[18:50] Like she'll hand over her pay to me every month.
[18:54] Mother! Why are you taking tension?
[18:58] Faraz still hands his pay over to you, right? This house is maintained by Faraz and he does everything from his expense.
[19:05] You are good in both states.
[19:13] Don't disturb the peace in this house for nothing.
[20:16] Mother! Why are you still up? You should sleep.
[20:22] I cannot sleep darling! I'm missing Mahi.
[20:28] The house feels so empty without her.
[20:31] Only some hours have past right now.
[20:34] It feels so weird! You remember that before her marriage we used to fight a lot.
[20:44] Now this room feels so quite.
[20:49] Whatever happened before her departure! I'm thinking about it and stressing.
[20:55] Saqlain shouldn't have said something like that at such moment! Faraz and his family would've later blamed Mahi.
[21:04] What happened? He got insulted too. You know that it's the behavior of Saqlain.
[21:11] He tries to act tough and wealthy so that he can insult the one in front of him.
[21:16] If we think! The money that Saqlain gave me actually belongs to us.
[21:22] You! You should call Mahi! Ask her that is everything fine!
[21:35] Mother! It's 2 am.
[21:39] I don't think that this is a suitable time to call sister.
[21:42] Fine! You should sleep now. I disturbed you.
[21:49] Good night!  Good night!
[21:52] Go and sleep.
[22:50] Here! It's for you.
[23:04] Thank you!
[23:08] It might not please you but I bought it for you in love.
[23:16] I can see your love!
[23:20] I don't care about the value of the gift.
[23:27] I was really nervous at night that I forgot to give you the gift.
[23:33] You said so much at night.
[23:38] I want to share something with you too. You might not know everything about my past.
[23:46] But whatever happened! I cannot change it.
[23:51] But I'm responsible for my future.
[23:57] I want you to trust me.
[24:02] That our relation might not be full of love.
[24:08] But this relation will have honesty in it.
[24:14] I'll try my best to spend a faithful life with you.
[24:21] You won't complain.
[24:27] Believe me! A day will come when you'll start to love me too.
[24:35] And I'll wait for that day.
[25:42] Rimsha!
[25:43] Yes?
[25:44] How long will it take you? We are getting late.
[25:47] Just 5 more minutes.
[25:49] Mahi would be waiting! Areeba and Saqlain haven't reached yet.
[25:53] I've got somethings ready but Saqlain said that he'll bring the breakfast.
[25:58] Then why are you scolding me?
[26:01] You should go and call Saqlain! How would we go there if he isn't here.
[26:05] Fine! I'll call him.
[26:07] Yes! Do it.
[26:19] Greetings mother!
[26:21] Greetings!
[26:22] Areeba! Where are you guys? You haven't reached yet. We have to take breakfast to Mahi's home.
[26:28] Mother! He is asleep right now. You know that he was so tired the whole night.
[26:33] What? he is sleeping?
[26:35] He said it himself that he'll bring the breakfast. How should I manage now?
[26:40] Mother! Leave it. Mahnoor's family in law can get their own breakfast. 
[26:46] Areeba! It's a good act after marriage.
[26:50] I told Mahi that I'll do such a thing! What will she think?
[26:54] Mother! You are just worried about Mahnoor only. You don't care about me?
[26:59] I'm not waking him up! He was already mad at night.
[27:04] You should go to Mahnoor's house yourself with breakfast. You can do whatever you like. I don't care.
[27:12] Areeba! Hello! Hello Areeba.
[27:16] What happened?
[27:18] Saqlain is not coming?
[27:21] No! He is sleeping.
[27:25] Fine! We go through public transport. I'll book a ride!
[27:30] We'll go by ourselves?
[27:34] Nothing happens! We can take the breakfast with us to their house too. I'll book a ride. You should wait.
[27:43] It's coming in 5 minutes. Hurry!
[27:46] Let me pack the things I made.
[27:48] Do it quick.
[27:54] Wow! Its so annoying.
[27:57] So much time has passed. There no sign of Mahnoor's family.
[28:04] last night her mother was promising to send the breakfast! How can they do such acts when they cannot send dowry with her.
[28:16] I'll have to arrange the breakfast myself! Arnah!
[28:22] Arnah come here!
[28:23] Yes!
[28:24] Darling you should..
[28:28] Greetings!   Greetings!   Greetings!
[28:33] You woke up late today?
[28:35] We woke up early mother! We were just talking to each other.
[28:45] What's the plan for breakfast today?
[28:49] Your wifes family had to bring the breakfast today! I think that their intentions have hanged now.
[28:56] I'll get the breakfast ready now! Go and tell Maheer to bring bread and eggs.
[29:02] No! Something special should be presented for the breakfast today. I'll go get a dish everyone loves. I'll be back.
[29:14] I'll go make something too.
[29:18] Sister in law! Why are you standing there? Come and sit here. Relax!
[29:22] Did you like the house?
[29:26] It's beautiful.
[29:33] Listen!
[29:37] Listen!
[29:38] Get up! It's late.
[29:44] What's the time?
[29:45] It's 10:30 ! Mother called me.
[29:49] She was saying that you had to take breakfast to Mahnoor's home! I told her that there's no need and you are sleeping.
[29:57] You did right.
[29:59] It was your sister's wedding and now I should take breakfast to their home too?
[30:06] Make me a cup of tea!
[30:52] I cannot believe it that we are having a breakfast so late today.
[30:58] Bring some more too.
[31:15] Do the breakfast!
[31:18] Take this too!
[31:27] She can take everything herself!
[31:32] You should sit and do breakfast yourself too. Ask Maheer to come and join us. I have to take my medicines too.
[31:42] Should I give you something?
[31:44] No! thank you. You should eat.
[32:00] Who came now? Go!
[32:03] Ask Maheer to check the door and do breakfast with us.
[32:19] Its your house! Your kitchen!
[32:25] What's the big deal! Its good that I can spend some time with you.
[32:32] How are you darling?
[32:34] I'm fine!
[32:36] Why did you guys get so late? I was waiting for you.
[32:40] Actually Saqlain didn't come! I apologize that we got late.
[32:51] Aunt you should not apologize! You did so much for us today. There was no need.
[32:58] We did need this fun for our good hearts! Its nothing! This'll make Mahi happy!
[33:08] You should eat please!
[33:09] Not like this. Rimsha! Bring the breakfast quickly.
[33:13] I'm coming!
[33:16] Seriously?
[33:18] Its nothing! Help me with it.
[33:22] What is Rimsha doing in the kitchen? I've to talk to her too.
[33:27] She is helping in the kitchen to get it arranged.
[33:33] She is such a bad actor! Now she has came to make some fuss. 
[33:57] Are you still busy today or you want to meet me?
[34:34] what's the password?
[35:13] I brought clothes for you.
[36:23] What is this all?
[36:27] It's all for you!
[36:31] Me? I didn't need it. You should have not.
[36:35] This all is sent by mother for you!
[36:40] She sent it with love! I hope you'll like it.
[36:47] I'll call her and thank her.
[36:53] I have to give this to aunt! I'll go give it to her.
[37:22] Aunt! Should I come in?
[37:25] Come!
[37:30] What is this medicine about? Are you alright?
[37:36] It's medicine for blood pressure.
[37:39] I'm having a headache.
[37:43] I've been so fatigued by the arrangements of the wedding.
[37:51] Whatever! Tell me why did you come here?
[37:55] Mother sent some gifts for you.
[38:02] What was the need for all of this? They should have given you something for your use.
[38:13] Watch? Who is this for?
[38:16] Its for you! Mother sent it.
[38:22] No way! For me? Thank you! It look so good.
[38:35] Here! This necklace is for you!
[38:40] Aunt! These are for you. Clothes too.
[38:47] I hope that you'll like everything!
[38:50] Fine!
[38:52] You didn't need to! But Thank you!
[39:00] I'll go now.
[39:11] Is it real?
