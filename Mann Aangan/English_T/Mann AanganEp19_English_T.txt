[01:24] Auntie has been constantly calling. The phone has been inside, ringing, and you're sitting out here?
[01:33] I don't understand something... if auntie has finalized Mahnoor's relationship on her say-so...
[01:41] then what's the point in her calling like this?
Let her call.
[01:47] I will not talk to her, neither will I show my face to her.
[01:52] If mother marries Mahnoor to Faraz, I will not be present in that marriage.
[02:01] Do you remember when I told you that Mahnoor was lying?
[02:06] Everyone who saw Mahnoor and Faraz together could see that something was going on between them.
[02:11] Look at the gall of that man, he reached her home with a proposal.
Did you take a look at Faraz?
[02:18] He has no class or personality. Mahnoor should take a look at herself and then think about Faraz'a proposal.
[02:26] How will he fit into our family... there is no comparison between you and him.
[02:34] That's what I'm trying to make you understand. Seeing Faraz and Mahnoor together...
[02:42] is like silk being sewn into tires.
[02:50] That's what I want. Today I've used Mahnoor's stubbornness in my favor.
[02:58] I don't want anyone to stand against me. You'll learn your lesson after your marriage. The person you're taking a stand for...
[03:10] will make you regret it.
[03:32] Hello...
Were you sleeping?
[03:37] No... I sleep late, I don't have a habit of sleeping early.
[03:44] I wanted to thank you, for the way you took a stand for me in front of your family.
[03:52] You don't realize how great of a favor you've done me by accepting my proposal.
[04:01] Mahnoor...
[04:04] I respect you a lot and I don't know when I started taking a liking to you.
[04:15] Just trust me...
[04:19] I will answer everyone who's speaking against us.
[04:28] Mahnoor, are you listening?
Yes, I am. Actually, I wanted to apologize...
[04:35] I'm sorry for the disrespect brother Sufyan and sister Areeba showed you and your mother.
[04:54] I've brought some great news for you, but you've only brought me water. Why not some sherbet?
[05:01] I've never been lucky enough to hear good news from you. We're out of sherbet, so you'll have to make do with this.
[05:09] What has happened to your mood today?
I'm not feeling well today. You tell me...
[05:16] I've brought two great proposals for Faraz and Aima.
[05:20] They live in America, and they want to marry their daughter and son together, that too quickly.
[05:26] I've talked about Aima and Faraz.
[05:32] I've already sent Faraz's proposal somewhere, talk to them about Aima.
Where have you sent Faraz'a proposal?
[05:42] It's someone Faraz likes. It's a million times better than the ones that you brought.
[05:50] By God's good grace, the girl is highly educated. She has an officer-grade job and she's also the owner of many shops and houses.
[06:00] What should I tell them then?
It's obvious that you should either refuse or talk to them about Aima.
[06:08] That's very hard, they won't agree. I had already convinced them.
[06:11] Anyways, I'll look at some other suitor for Aima.
[06:15] Besides, you've removed Faraz's burden from me.
Yes, thank God I've been unburdened by Faraz's worry.
[06:29] Have your water.
[06:33] What are your plans? Do you have any rituals in mind, or do you want to directly marry?
[06:40] There should be at least one ritual ceremony. You guys just set things. Right brother?
[06:50] Sure... we should have at least one ritual.
[06:54] Alright then... we'll visit them on Sunday. Be sure to tell Mahnoor.
[07:03] Sunday? I'm busy on Sunday.
[07:11] Why? What's with you?
[07:17] It's an educational trip. I'm going to the northern areas for a week.
[07:24] Good luck.
Thank you.
[07:28] Your brother is getting married and you...
[07:35] My dear, I called you so many times, why didn't you pick up? I had to come to your home to talk to you.
[07:41] What should I have said?
[07:44] The good news that you were trying to tell me, I didn't want to hear it. Saqlain and I...
[07:51] did not approve of the relationship that you're setting for Mahnoor. Not once did you think if those people are of our level.
[08:02] My dear, you didn't give me a chance to decide. You started abusing them from the get-go. If you hadn't done that, I would have found an excuse.
[08:15] You could still refuse, but you won't do that. It's obvious that you want to stand by Mahnoor's stubborn decision, even if it breaks relationships.
[08:25] Why would any of our relationships break? Why are you fighting with her? She does not fault this.
[08:33] Auntie is right... your emotional behavior has cost us. This could have been over with.
[08:41] Still, we can't change what happened.
[08:48] Auntie, tell me... what do we need to do in the future. Will it be a marriage directly...
[08:55] or do you want to conduct a ritual?
The marriage will be done soon. Mahi wants no pageantry.
[09:03] They are coming tomorrow to have a small engagement ritual. I want you two to forget everything and join us tomorrow.
[09:15] I will not be present.
[09:23] Areeba... auntie don't worry. I'll take care of all the arrangements.
[09:30] Mahnoor is my sister... her marriage won't be a simple one... it will have all the pageantry.
[09:37] We will be present at it.
[09:42] Bless you, my dear.
[09:52] Areeba...
Forget her... I'll take care of her.
[11:11] People who join my name with yours...
[11:15] the way pass judgment on you for that... for that...
[11:22] I am a simple man and I really don't know any flashy ways. I feel that you have been insulted by me...
[11:35] I don't even know who the bigger fool among the two of us is...
[11:42] Going against brother Saqlain I did agree to marry Faraz, but will this not create more trouble for me?
[11:56] Sister Mahnoor...
[12:00] Yes?
It really is strange...
[12:05] I thought that there would be a lot of people coming in from their family, but there weren't many.
[12:11] It's alright.
We also had only our family.
[12:17] Hmm... the gifts that they brought were only subpar as well.
[12:24] You should have realized the type of presents that they would have brought for Mahnoor, seeing their status.
[12:30] That's why Saqlain and I did not approve of this relationship. There is no match between Faraz and Mahnoor.
[12:45] Sister Mahnoor, sister Areeba is right...
[12:50] Look at how ideal a couple sister Areeba and brother Saqlain are, on the other hand, there is brother Faraz.
[12:58] He doesn't match well with you at all.
[13:03] Ramsha...
Anyways...
[13:26] Mother...
[13:28] Sister Mahnoor's house was really nice, right? Her mother gave us nice presents as well.
[13:34] You only gave them two suits, and they two were subpar. Thank God that brother Faraz bought that ring, otherwise you had no intention of buying one.
[13:44] He has chosen his wife and therefore he also chose the ring. He didn't ask me, because he was worried that I might stash the money.
[13:53] What are you saying, mother? Has brother Faraz ever said something so shallow to you?
[13:59] This is the first time he's chosen to marry someone. What need was there to spend so much money?
[14:07] The marriage is after two weeks.
[14:11] What's the point in spending so much on a gold ring and clothes?
Mother, I don't know why you're so upset.
[14:19] It was your wish to see brother Faraz married. Now that he has expressed his choice, why do you feel so bad about it?
[14:30] It's not that Faraz chose a girl to marry...
[14:35] it's just that the match between Mahnoor and Faraz doesn't seem nice to me. Think for yourself...
[14:43] How come Mahnoor agreed to this proposal when her family did not agree?
She agreed to this because she likes brother Faraz.
[14:52] God knows if she likes him or not. I hope she doesn't intend to boss him around, as she does at work.
[15:03] Lord knows what she'll do in this house.
She will do nothing.
[15:09] Don't think so negatively. There's not much time in the wedding, this way everything will be dealt with quickly. Shall we go?
[15:18] Sit down and study.
[15:23] Sometimes you ask me to study and sometimes you don't.
[15:41] Thank you.
[15:44] Please sit down.
[15:53] This is about the meeting that happened today.
[16:18] I was thinking about what your favorite color could be...
Pardon?
[16:23] Every color looks good on you. But there is always one color that one likes more.
[16:32] The wedding dress should be of that color.
[16:42] This is fine.
[17:08] Where's Fariya?
She must be in her room upstairs.
[17:12] Alright...
Saqlain...
[17:15] Listen to me for a few minutes.
What is it?
[17:20] Look... I know that you've done me and Fariya a lot of favors...
[17:25] You helped us when we needed it...
[17:30] You gave us such a big home and you take care of everything for us...
Wait a minute...
[17:37] Be straightforward... what do you want to say?
[17:42] My dear, I'm very worried about Fariya...
[17:47] I understand that you're with her, but how long will you stay with her without something prominent?
[17:53] When I think about Fariya's future, I feel very afraid.
[17:59] And she has gotten used to you as well.
[18:05] Look, my son...
[18:06] If you marry her... then my worries will be over...
[18:12] and then I'll lay on my deathbed peacefully.
[18:43] Did you now know that I was here?
I did...
[18:48] Besides, who else comes here but you?
[18:52] If it's like that, then why didn't you come outside?
[18:58] Because I didn't feel like seeing you.
[19:02] Exactly the same way you didn't feel like picking up my calls for so many days.
[19:12] It's not about what I feel, it's about the situation.
[19:17] I cannot always talk to you.
[19:21] And why don't you make your mother understand?
[19:26] She still mentioned our marriage today.
[19:30] What's so wrong with that?
[19:34] You love me... I love you...
[19:39] then I don't understand why we shouldn't marry.
[19:49] You know that very well. I'm already married.
[19:55] I know that you're married.
[19:59] And now I also know that your love was only a lie, you were just passing the time with me.
[20:08] And I know that the day you grow tired of me, you will leave me.
[20:14] If I wanted to end this relationship, I would have ended it a long time ago.
[20:20] There was no need to drag this on. As far as Areeba is concerned, you know why I'm maintaining that relationship.
[20:29] Until and unless I transfer all her property in my name, I can't divorce her.
[20:36] Don't divorce her. We can still marry.
[20:43] Besides, what has Areeba given you? She couldn't even give you a child.
Alright.
[20:51] We'll think about that.
[20:54] We can't decide that sitting here, it will take some time.
[21:00] Where were you busy that you didn't even call me?
[21:06] I was very busy. But today I've come here completely free.
[21:13] Let's go out and have dinner today at a nice place.
[21:18] Really?
Yes.
[21:22] What if your wife sees us together again?
[21:26] No one will see us... coincidences happen every day.
[21:32] Go and get ready. We'll have dinner at your favorite restaurant today.
[21:40] Let's go...
Let's go.
[21:48] Which one of these looks better? This... or this?
[22:02] This one...
Okay... your choice is just like mine.
[22:09] I'll wear this then.
[22:47] Let me see your hand.
[23:11] I didn't want to waste my life...
[23:16] with a prideful and stubborn girl like you.
[23:21] Mrs. Mahnoor...
[23:26] I divorce you...
[23:35] For how long will I live in fear that my past might repeat itself,
[23:42] This way I'll never be able to move on.
[23:46] Whatever happened to me in the past, I will not let it become a hurdle to my happiness.
[23:52] I will start my new life because I want to move on.
[24:45] That means that Saqlain won't come home tonight as well.
[25:49] Sister...
[25:51] Sister... try and make mother understand. Because she doesn't listen to me.
What aren't you listening to?
[25:58] She has gone insane.
[26:01] I took out some stuff for your dowry. I decided that I'll give some to you, and I'll keep some for her.
[26:07] And I'll check how much more new stuff I need to buy.
Why would she want to take that old stuff with her?
[26:14] You should have donated that to someone...
Why should I? It's expensive... it could come in handy...
[26:21] to the two of you.
I would never take that old stuff with me.
[26:25] I think that you shouldn't take it with you as well.
Fine, don't wear it...
[26:32] It's Mahnoor's stuff, it's up to her to wear it or throw it away.
No...
[26:36] Don't throw it away. We bought it with money...
[26:42] Besides, the stuff wasn't bad, it was just the circumstances.
[26:47] My dear, there's no need to remember the past. There is no need to remember it.
[26:54] I'm just worried about how we'll get things done in time. Areeba isn't helping me at all.
[27:01] I still haven't given an order for Aneesha. I don't know if I should buy it ready-made, or have it made.
[27:08] And I still haven't seen your home as well. I don't know what you need there.
[27:15] Firstly, stop worrying so much. Secondly, whatever is needed there, we'll buy it together. 
[27:23] As far as the dowry is concerned, I don't want it.
[27:27] It's like I said before.
Mahi...
[27:31] Things were different before.
Alright fine, I'll buy whatever I need with you.
[27:42] And you, stop bothering mother.
[27:51] Is it here?
I think it's probably on that shelf.
[27:56] I think it might be here.
[28:22] Hi...
Hello.
[28:27] How was the trip?
[28:29] The trip? Cool... awesome...
[28:33] You guys missed an amazing chance.
[28:36] Yes... we would have come, but what could we have done, we didn't have permission from home.
[28:41] It's alright, next time when there is a plan...
[28:45] please join us, bye.
Bye.
[28:55] Thank God that he talked to me.
But don't get after him like before.
[29:00] Otherwise, he'll start giving you the attitude again.
No, that won't happen this time.
[29:11] That's perfect. You two have worked very well. I need the same efficiency from your department on the next project.
[29:21] Sir, we'll try our best. We'll try to give an even better performance next time.
Great.
[29:29] Sir... I need to talk to you about something important.
[29:33] Actually... I need a leave for two weeks.
[29:37] Is everything alright?
Yes sir...
[29:43] I'm getting married.
That's great. Congratulations.
[29:51] When is your wedding?
[29:54] Sir, this Sunday. Four days from now.
[29:59] Actually, the cards haven't been printed, but still, I'm inviting you. Please, be sure to come.
[30:06] Who's the lucky guy?
[30:11] What's his profession? Does he have a job or a business?
[30:19] Sir, I'm getting married to Mr. Faraz.
What?
[30:26] Mahnoor... you're marrying Faraz?
[30:30] Yes sir...
That's so strange. That means that people were speaking the truth about you at work.
[30:35] And here I was fighting for you in the office.
[30:40] Sir... we've taken this decision to shut those people up.
[30:47] The way our staff was targeting Miss Mahnoor, have you ever thought...
[30:54] how badly miss Mahnoor was defamed by all of this? The bad effect it had on her family...
[31:04] She's been going through a lot of pain.
Faraz, you are making their allegations true.
[31:11] One can think whatever they want...
[31:15] I'll deal them with myself... whoever that speaks ill of miss Mahnoor, I'll set them straight myself.
[31:24] Anyone who dares put an allegation on her will have to first face me.
[32:22] Areeba I've bought you a few suits.
[32:28] Look at how they are. I thought...
[32:33] that you would not shop for the wedding because you were upset. You didn't come to help me as well.
[32:37] So I decided to take Ramsha and Mahi with me...
[32:43] Look at the scarf, it's so beautiful.
[32:52] What happened Areeba? Why are you crying?
[32:56] Sister Areeba?
[33:06] Mahi... Ramsha...
[33:09] Why is she crying?
Sister, what has happened to you?
[33:13] Why are you crying?
[33:19] Tell us why are you crying. Did you argue with brother Saqlain, did he say something?
[33:34] I went to a gynecologist today...
[33:38] And?
[33:44] She...
[33:48] She had patients who hadn't been able to conceive for ten years.
[33:54] After being treated by her all of them were blessed with children.
[34:00] She took a look at my reports as well.
[34:04] But she didn't give me any hope.
[34:11] She said that...
[34:15] there are no chances.
[34:24] Why has fate been so unjust to me? What have I ever done to anyone?
[34:36] Be strong... you are very brave. One shouldn't blame fate this way.
Why shouldn't I blame fate?
[34:44] What is this other than my ill fate?
[34:48] For years I have been bearing taunts of barrenness.
[34:54] Why doesn't God take mercy on me?
Areeba, have faith in God my dear...
[35:00] God loves one more than seventy mothers. What will the doctors do?
[35:07] God is the one who gives us children.
[35:13] Have faith in God and keep praying to him.
[35:16] God will accept your prayers and I've been praying for you as well.
[35:37] I'm very worried about my daughter. How long will you stay with her without anything prominent?
[35:43] If you marry her, then all my worries will end and then I can lay on my deathbed without any worries.
[35:55] I know that you're married, but we can still marry.
[36:04] Besides, what has Areeba given you? She couldn't even give you a child.
[36:19] What are you doing?
[36:21] Brother Faraz asked me to set up his wardrobe and make space for sister Mahnoor.
[36:28] Are you his maid that you'll do this for her? Keep it the way it was...
[36:33] When she comes here, she'll set it herself.
[36:39] I'm surprised that tomorrow is the mehndi and they still haven't sent the dowry.
[36:47] Do they intend not to give their daughter a dowry?
What can I say about that?
[36:55] They are strange people... I can't even call and ask them.
[37:01] How will this room be set without proper furniture?
It's not like it's empty. Brother Faraz's room does have furniture.
[37:08] It would look so awkward if we call and ask.
It's not like up till now everything has been normal...
[37:13] It's not like my question about the dowry would be inappropriate.
[37:18] All of this seems like a game to me. Keep all of this back.
[37:38] Sister... shall I ask you something?
[37:42] What is it?
Have you fallen in love with brother Faraz?
[37:50] No...
What do you mean, no?
[37:54] If you haven't fallen in love with him, then why are you marrying him?
[38:00] Is it important to love someone to marry them?
[38:06] To marry someone... one needs to look at...
[38:13] class, status, education, and money. What else does one need to look for in their life partner?
[38:19] Respect.
[38:21] Class, status, money, education... all of that...
[38:28] to one side, but can one spend one's life without respect?
[38:32] No, right? Faraz respects me...
[38:37] In my respect, he dares to fight the entire world.
[38:43] And that's what I like about him. What else does a woman need?
[38:50] If there is respect in a relationship, then love indeed finds its way.
[38:59] But in any relationship, there is no respect...
[39:04] then love changes its path as well.
That's fair.
