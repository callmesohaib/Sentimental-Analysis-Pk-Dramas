[01:08] Mother! No! No!
[01:14] No! You cannot leave us like this! Mother please! Talk to me.
[01:33] Tell them to get away from mother. Sister please get away.
[01:43] Mother! Listen mother! Wake up mother. Open your eyes mother. Mother please!
[01:53] Please call the doctor! This cannot happen! This cannot happen. Sister!
[02:05] You guys won't listen to me. I'll call the doctor myself.
[02:08] Rimsha!
[03:33] Mother! Mother!
[03:38] What happened? Why do you look so stunned? Is everything alright?
[03:44] Mother! Mahnoor's mother just died.
[03:51] What?
[04:02] Faraz told me that we should go to there house with Maheer.
[04:08] Fine!
[04:11] They'll be in the hospital right now. We'll surely leave after they reach home.
[05:23] If she had only seen her youngest daughter get married too.
[05:29] The eldest two are stable and have their own families. Who'll look after Rimsha?
[05:34] There's no father or mother to look after them. They don't even have a brother who could've looked after them.
[05:43] What can we say! It's gods plan that her youngest daughter isn't married.
[05:48] How will she manage without her mother?
[05:52] Whatever god decides.
[06:03] You cannot leave us like this. Sister! Tell mother that she cannot leave us. We cannot live without her.
[06:12] Mother! Please don't leave us like this mother. Please mother!
[06:17] Ask her! How can she leave us alone like this?
[06:21] Sister! Control!
[06:47] Please sister! Ask mother to wake up one last time. Please sister ask her. Ask mother to open her eyes! Please sister.
[07:00] Please sister! Ask mother to wake up one last time. I won't ever disturb her after that! She'll listen to you sister.
[07:16] Sister!
[08:10] It's time for the funeral!
[08:12] Saqlain!
[08:16] No darling! Stay calm.
[08:19] You guys won't take her! No not at all. Please don't take her.
[08:29] Faraz! Don't take my mother away from me. Faraz please!
[11:15] Mahnoor! Your tears will hurt your mother.
[11:22] Doctor said that mother is totally healthy and her operation was successful too. How can she leave us like that?
[11:33] She still had to live for us.
[11:44] It all happens according to god's plan.
[11:47] But mother...
[12:03] Fine! You can cry as much as you want.
[12:12] It'll help you release the pressure on your heart.
[12:20] But I know that crying won't bring her back.
[12:29] You are so strong! You've faced many problems so confidently.
[12:36] If you lose your determination and continue with crying. Who'll take care of Rimsha? Who'll worry about her?
[12:56] She is really close to you. She is younger than you.
[13:02] She needs you.
[14:51] Rimsha!
[14:56] Stop crying! Control your emotions.
[15:13] Mother just left me alone.
[15:26] There's no one to look after me.
[15:30] No! You're not alone.
[15:42] Rimsha! Your sisters are here for you. I'm here for you too.
[15:50] We all are here for you. You are not alone.
[15:56] Crying won't help you heal the wounds.
[16:09] Ask her to stop crying.
[16:12] Fine! Now stop crying.
[16:22] You guys haven't ate! Please eat something.
[16:28] I'm not hungry!
[16:29] You still have to eat.
[16:34] You guys didn't eat anything from yesterday.
[16:42] I'll ask Salma to bring some food for you guys.
[16:46] Areeba! Where is Saqlain?
[16:53] I don't know! He might be outside.
[16:58] He is also really stressed like us.
[17:38] Enough!
[17:40] Eat more!
[17:41] I've eaten too much.
[17:43] No! You haven't.
[17:45] It's enough for me.
[17:48] I'll go now.
[17:49] Thank god that she left.
[17:55] You are right! Thank god that she left us.
[18:01] She somehow knew about my second marriage and the kid.
[18:07] There could've been a drama.
[18:12] Those three sisters are still a headache for you.
[18:15] Don't you worry. I'll handle them.
[18:21] I'll go now.
[18:22] Where are you going?
[18:24] Keep sitting! Don't move to much in such condition. Take care of yourself.
[18:30] I'm going home! Where else would I go?
[18:35] I came here from there to relax my mind a little bit. I'll have to hear the cries again.
[18:44] Sure! Will you visit me tomorrow?
[18:50] I'll visit you every time you call me.
[18:54] Even if you don't call me. I'll still come.
[19:08] I feel attached to you so much that you cannot imagine.
[19:12] Take care!
[19:14] Sure!
[20:46] Mahnoor!
[20:59] Rimsha! Why are you not eating? Here! Eat it.
[21:10] Areeba! You should eat too.
[21:21] Mahnoor! You need to eat. Please eat! Everyone should.
[21:34] You should eat too! You didn't eat.
[21:39] I'm fine.
[21:44] Eat with us.
[21:55] OK! I'll start. You guys should too.
[22:24] Eat it!
[22:47] Saqlain!
[22:52] Are you back? Where were you?
[22:57] Where would I be?
[23:00] I went to visit the graveyard.
[23:13] I cannot stay in this house after she left.
[23:21] Whatever! You guys should continue eating.
[23:29] I'm unable to digest a single bite. Faraz forcefully made us eat.
[23:41] You didn't eat anything too. Sit here!
[23:45] No! I won't be able to digest it.
[23:52] You should eat! I'm right here.
[23:56] Saqlain! Please sit. Eat something.
[24:03] No! I won't be able to eat.
[24:11] It's a great loss.
[24:19] You are new to this family! Your attachment isn't like mine.
[24:28] I'm was attached to aunt.
[24:36] She treated me like her son.
[24:43] Now that she isn't around anymore. I feel like somebody took my mother away from me again.
[24:55] Saqlain!
[25:01] You!
[25:01] I'm fine! Totally fine.
[25:04] Sit!
[25:06] Sit here.
[25:48] We are fine! You guys can eat.
[25:56] Fine.
[26:09] What are you doing mother?
[26:10] Tell me! Why did you ask Mahnoor for the books?
[26:15] Faraz could've brought you all these if you are really that interested in studies.
[26:19] When did you start studying such big books. You used to study so moderately.
[26:26] All that stuff is really boring mother! This book is really interesting. Even Mahnoor told me that I can ask her for any book.
[26:35] Whatever Mahnoor said! You should also learn how to place them.
[26:40] You are about to get married! You'll get me disrespected. Your parents in law will complain that I didn't teach you manners.
[26:47] Place it properly.
[26:48] Why are you always angry?
[26:50] I'll hit you.
[26:53] I'll teach you a lesson. Windup everything.
[27:07] Are you back son?
[27:09] Yes! Greetings.
[27:11] Greetings! I was thinking that you'll stay there son.
[27:19] Mahnoor didn't come?
[27:21] Mahnoor will be back soon.
[27:26] Why are you going in the kitchen?
[27:30] I was having a headache so I need some tea.
[27:34] Son! Tell me. I'm standing right in front of you.
[27:37] I didn't want to disturb you mother.
[27:39] Son! I'm your mother! I'm not your wife that you should feel ashamed for asking a favor.
[27:46] I've spent my whole life for your betterment. I've never thought about my own self.
[27:53] I'll make tea for you. Will you eat something?
[27:58] No! I did lunch.
[28:00] Don't lie!
[28:02] No mother! Mahnoor made me eat it. I just wanted some tea so I can take medicine before attending the office too.
[28:10] Now you'll attend the office too?
[28:13] Yes! It's important.
[28:14] Son! Take care of yourself. You are already too fatigued. Now you'll attend the office too?
[28:24] Mother! I'll be back soon.
[28:29] See! Mahnoor cannot attend the office so it's must for me to be there in her absence.
[28:38] Don't worry! I'll be back soon. I'll rest!
[28:44] Sit! I'll go make you some tea.
[29:08] I'm always praying for you all! What else can I do?
[29:16] Take care of Rimsha! I hope that I'll soon arrange her marriage.
[29:23] It's just a matter of one year! She wants to study so let her study. She'll get married soon.
[29:28] I don't know that I have that much of a time.
[29:43] Greetings sir!
[29:50] It was a serious and sudden heart attack! Thank you.
[29:58] I'll join soon! Thank you.
[30:19] What about the medicine report?
[30:37] You have to take care of yourself.
[30:49] How will she stay here all alone? I cannot stay here.
[30:58] You've to go back to your home too.
[31:06] I'll ask Saqlain that what should we do?
[31:12] She can come with me. I'll take her.
[31:19] You live in a proper family and it's not good for her to stay there.
[31:29] She can stay with us at our home.
[31:32] You know that Saqlain won't let her live here all alone.
[32:28] You can go handle the kitchen.
[32:30] Sure!
[32:34] Areeba! I've managed everything. Shared the food in the neighborhood too.
[32:42] The soul will get blessings. I've told Salma that she'll stay here 24/7.
[32:51] She'll be here for Rimsha!
[32:59] I was thinking..
[33:01] Areeba! We cannot leave Rimsha alone in this house.
[33:07] She is a kid! She'll get scared. I've told Salma to look after Rimsha.
[33:15] She look after Rimsha and the whole house properly.
[33:21] Do as you like but I was thinking that..
[33:27] Don't talk about her marriage right now.
[33:31] Aunt just recently died. This is not the time to discuss such things.
[33:39] She is a kid right now! Let her study. Aunt wanted this too.
[33:46] That she should finish her studies! We've spent millions on her studies.
[33:57] Let her complete the degree first.
[34:05] I'll go attend the call.
[34:43] Can I get a cup of tea?
[34:46] I'm studying right now.
[34:58] It's the fourth day! Mahnoor didn't think about returning back to her home.
[35:05] It's just been 4 days since aunt died. She'll be back.
[35:10] Darling! She has died and her soul has departed. I feel bad too. What else can we do?
[35:19] Mahnoor isn't responsible at all! She doesn't care about her home and her husband. Faraz has always supported her.
[35:29] He was just telling me that she has lost her mother so don't let Mahnoor feel like she doesn't have her mother around.
[35:39] Mahnoor should also care about Faraz!
[35:46] My hardworking son! He always comes home tired and doesn't have a wife around to ask him about a glass of water.
[35:53] What special thing did she do before? She is the boss of brother.
[35:59] She gives orders to him in the office then how can she be that humble at home.
[36:08] So you are the one who takes care of Faraz? You have never washed your own socks. Me and mother do it for you.
[36:19] Sister in law is really responsible! She gives equal time in the office and at home.
[36:26] Why are you taking her side?
[36:28] Now she doesn't care about this house or her office.
[36:30] Why would she? My brother is there. I feel like that she forcefully stopped the promotion of brother.
[36:48] So that he can work for her in the office and stay down to earth. Simple!
[37:38] Aunt! Do you need anything?
[37:41] No!
[37:45] Mahnoor! We have to go through a lot when we are alive.
[37:50] We have to suffer a lot of pain! This is life! I know that nobody can replace your parents.
[37:59] If I state myself as your mother. It won't actually change our relation and you won't literally think of me as your mother but still I'm telling you.
[38:10] I want that my sons stays happy and confident in his family so you should take some responsibilities too.
[38:23] I ..
[38:24] Enough! Try to understand me. He is your husband, not your servant. He has a lot of burden. Don't just sit at home.
[38:39] What did he get? You stopped his promotion too.
[38:44] I didn't do anything like this! I don't have the authority. You are being misguided by Maheer.
[38:51] Fine! Whatever happened, let it go.
[38:58] I didn't want you to work from the day you got married. Faraz just didn't let me speak.
[39:06] Now he is facing the problems himself.
[39:11] I'll go now.
