[02:09] have you seen the report?
[02:11] yes
[02:13] also we've got to know that the medicines were contaminated
[02:15] yes, we've got to know that something was added to her medicines
[02:19] means, poison
[02:25] this is the same poison which was found in your mother's blood report
[02:29] look at your mother's blood report, you can check it yourself
[02:53] it means... 
[02:56] it means my mother was killed by poison
[03:01] and that too by adding in her medicine?
[03:04] yes, I was very sure about the medicine
[03:08] in fact, the reason of her death was massive heart attack
[03:12] because we have cleaned the effect of poison. That's why it is said, one is helpless infront of death
[03:38] thank you!
[03:48] no matter whatever everyone thinks that mother died because of a heart attack
[03:52] but now the doctor had also said
[03:55] that mother died because of the poison added to her medicines
[04:01] and those medicines were brought by brother Saqlain
[04:09] whom are you calling?
[04:12] sister Areeba
[04:14] Mahnoor, think before calling. What if you guys have a fight
[04:17] what shall I think?
[04:20] my mother died because of these medicines
[04:24] my mother's death wasn't unconditioned, in fact she was poisoned
[04:37] yes Mahnoor, tell me... all good?
[04:40] sister Areeba, is brother Saqlain at home right now?
[04:44] No, he is in the office & I am at mom's house
[04:47] then call brother Saqlain home right away, I am coming there
[04:50] I want to discuss something important with both of you
[04:56] what happen, Mahnoor. Is everything fine?
[04:58] I will tell that after coming home
[05:05] lets go
[05:15] hello! Can you please come home for a while?
[05:20] Mahnoor had called, she was saying that she wants to discuss something important with you
[05:26] yes, I have told her that I will call you home
[05:30] Ok, I am waiting
[05:43] you guys are doing the workout here, & I've been searching for you guys in the entire university
[05:49] what's the matter! You have given a lot of time to Ramsha today
[05:54] actually her mood was off
[05:58] so I thought to fix her mood, that's it
[06:02] you are pitying someone? I don't believe it
[06:06] it seems that he has fallen for Ramsha in real, otherwise he makes the girls come after him
[06:12] sometimes, one needs to change their rules to play the game
[06:18] and its not a sin to change your rules to win
[06:23] come on, carry on the workout
[06:25] anyways, tell me what is your plan after this?
[06:30] what does she wants to discuss now that she has called me in such an emergency?
[06:34] I hope she haven't come to ask for her inheritance share, or maybe... 
[06:39] how are you, Mahnoor?
[06:41] I'm fine, how about you?
[06:42] and Faraz, you?
[06:44] yes, I am also fine. How are you doing?
[06:45] yes, I am fine. Please come
[06:51] sit
[06:54] have you told brother Saqlain that I want to talk to him?
[06:59] yes, I had called him he is about to come
[07:01] by the way, what as such is the matter that you guys came in an emergency
[07:05] the matter is quite important
[07:08] actually... 
[07:08] Mahnoor, may I talk?
[07:12] sister, actually the matter is that we've got the results of aunt's medicines samples
[07:23] they were poisonous
[07:25] So, the same poison can be observed in her blood report
[07:35] what!
[07:36] yes.. 
[07:38] look at these blood reports
[07:46] even doctor has confirmed them
[08:00] who can add poison to mom's medicines?
[08:02] its obvious! the person who used to bring medicine for her must have added poison to them
[08:08] but mom's medicines... 
[08:10] I see... 
[08:13] so this is the conspiracy against me
[08:16] conspiracy?
[08:18] yes, conspiracy!
[08:20] even I was thinking that what as such matter your sister wanted to discuss with me & that too all of a sudden
[08:25] you did a conspiracy to kill my mother by adding poison to her medicines
[08:29] and there is no doubt that you used to bring her medicines
[08:37] you've gone mad!
[08:39] do you have any idea that you are putting an allegation on my husband
[08:43] this is their planning!
[08:47] they want to take revenge from me
[08:50] yes!
[08:52] I used to bring medicines for aunt, Mahnoor
[08:55] and not from today, I have been bringing them for so many years
[09:00] and if I had to kill her then I would have done that long time ago, I wouldn't have waited for so many years
[09:06] No, no... I believe you
[09:09] you can never think of doing any such thing
[09:12] I don't believe him at all! Also, the truth or lie will be decided
[09:17] I am going to file a complain to the police against him & proof! we have this proof
[09:22] I will show them that the medicines contain poison & he added it
[09:25] you have gone mad!
[09:26] did you see, she is threatening me!
[09:29] she will go to the police to file a complain against me
[09:32] it can be an ordinary thing for you that anyone call kill mother by giving poison, but its not an ordinary thing for me
[09:40] I will ensure to get him punished
[09:42] Mahnoor!
[09:43] sister please!
[09:58] have you gone mad?
[10:00] how dare you to hold my wife's hand? Are you crazy!
[10:05] nobody can raise their hand on Mahnoor infront of me
[10:07] yes I know, in fact not just me but your entire neighborhood knows
[10:11] that nobody can raise their hand on your wife in front of you, but you can oust her from the house anytime
[10:17] don't try to change the topic like this
[10:20] stick to the topic we are discussing. 
As far as Faraz is concerned
[10:24] so doing his character assassination won't hide your sin
[10:28] so what do you think, will you black mail me? Will you prove anything by showing the fake report?
[10:32] this report is true & I have the proof of it
[10:35] you have a proof
[10:37] how do I know? 
You had given these medicines for testing, right?
[10:41] maybe you have added the poison
[10:43] what are you saying? Why will I trap you?
sister Areeba, can you believe it that I will kill mom by giving poison?
[10:50] there is no need to do these dramas in front of me
[10:52] everyone knows it very well how much you care for everyone
[10:55] I remember it clearly, aunt used to call you whenever she was unwell. You people used to come here running
[11:01] yesterday, a robber came inside the house & poor Ramsha was all alone. She was so afraid that she was about to die
[11:07] you didn't even received her phone
[11:09] I came for help! I handled her, I have always handled all of you
[11:13] furthermore, I had handled your deceased mother as well. Your mother used to consider me her son
[11:18] and she used to tell you the same thing
[11:20] and now when she is no more in this world then, do you want to take revenge from me
[11:30] Fine!
[11:32] prove it! prove whatever you want to
[11:35] I will also see how will you handle your sisters then
[11:38] I will handle my sisters
[11:44] my sisters aren't a burden on me, and you cannot black mail me for this
[11:48] be quiet!
[12:02] you always wanted to break my marriage
[12:05] you have always provoked me & mom against him
[12:16] Ramsha is the witness 
[12:18] sister Areeba, what are you saying? I can't even think of it
[12:21] then how can you put such a big allegation on my husband?
[12:33] go away from here!
[12:34] leave & never show me your face ever
[12:38] nobody needs to go anywhere! All of you shall stay here together with love, I am leaving
[12:42] you cannot leave me
[12:45] I promise you! I will never come in this house ever, nor I will see her face ever again
[12:49] leave my hand
[12:50] I will go with you
sister!
[12:53] sister... 
how can you leave me?
[12:54] listen to me, where are you going?
you won't go anywhere after leaving me please
[13:02] what are you looking at now? Go back to your house!
[13:06] we are already so worried and you... 
[13:09] go away!
[13:12] Mahnoor, lets go
[13:15] Mahnoor, I'm telling you to come
[13:29] I want to go back to my house
[13:31] give me my mobile. Bring my mobile, I want to go to my house
[13:38] I want to go to my house with my husband
[13:51] I will ensure to make you beg
[13:54] I will make you apologize
[13:56] when Areeba will make your life a living hell like always, then it will fix your mind
[14:19] do visit the house tonight as well
[14:22] and repeat whatever you did last night
[14:25] but don't enter the house
[14:28] got it?
[14:58] sister... what happen?
[15:02] he has switched off his phone
[15:06] I am going to my house, I want to go to my house
[15:09] what do you mean that you are going home? I am alone here, what will I do?
[15:14] so, shall I leave my husband?
[15:17] he had left in anger
[15:22] earlier, mom was there... she used to call him to appease him
[15:26] and used to call him here
[15:30] who will call him now?
[15:32] you know brother Saqlain doesn't listens to anyone whenever he is angry
[15:38] I will appease him, he will agree
[15:41] he won't come, I know him
[15:43] at least don't cry
[15:45] for what Mahnoor took revenge from me?
[15:49] sister... please don't cry
[15:54] please don't cry
how!
[16:00] my sister has put an allegation on my husband for killing my mother
[16:07] I have to see this day as well
[16:25] I had told you, whatever you do... do it after thinking a lot
[16:29] because I knew it that there would be a fight
[16:32] sorry
[16:35] you had to hear so many things from brother Saqlain because of me
[16:39] I don't care about those things
[16:41] I am angry on the fact that he misbehaved with you, he reacted a lot. I could have answered him
[16:47] but the result could have turned out to be bad and...
[16:49] what's new in this?
[16:51] its brother Saqlain's habit, he leaves after getting angry on every petty matter and
[16:56] then I have to apologize to him upon mom's insistence
[17:00] maybe the intensity of those matters isn't very high
[17:04] this time he has been blamed, that's why he is restless
[17:07] its evident that he will react more
[17:09] I am afraid, what if he leaves sister Areeba...
[17:12] No
[17:15] sister Areeba is his protective shield
[17:18] he knows, if anyone can save him then its just sister Areeba
[17:22] therefore, he always uses sister Areeba as his protective shield
[17:30] Mahnoor, if we see it through reality instead of being emotional then
[17:35] neither aunt's death happened because of the poison nor
[17:41] we are confirmed that the poison is added by Saqlain
[17:45] yes, the medicine was poisonous. And we have the proof of it but...
[17:50] it is not confirmed that who had added it
[17:53] I will suggest you to think before acting on anything
[17:58] what if we face a huge loss & don't get anything
[18:29] thank you dear, stay happy
[18:46] oh dear, you guys took a lot of time
[18:49] I had told you that Yasir & his mother are coming
[18:53] Mahnoor, they have come to meet you
[18:56] mom actually....
hey Mahnoor, you are back?
[19:01] *greetings!*
[19:04] We've been waiting for you since so long
[19:07] dear, I am so sorry to hear about your mother's demise
[19:12] I can't believe, it was a shock for me. What had happened to her all of a sudden?
[19:19] she had a heart attack
[19:21] oh! okay
[19:23] she had a bypass too, actually she was already very unwell
[19:29] dear, nobody can replace parents
[19:33] but don't think yourself alone, all of us are with you
[19:37] and then, a mother in law is also like a mother
[19:41] am I right sister Shehla?
[19:43] yes absolutely
[19:45] I don't see any difference in Aima & Mahnoor, she is also my daughter
[19:51] by the way, if you want... you can consider me as your mother too
[19:54] you can come to meet me at my house anytime
[20:03] thank you, aunty
[20:05] thank you!...
[21:10] I don't understand your mother in law, as if she wanted to adopt her
[21:16] she didn't even looked at her to be daughter in law properly
[21:20] she was being so kind to her
[21:27] Aima! I am talking to you, not to the walls
[21:33] she is such a weird woman
[21:36] either she is trying to make a separate relation with Mahnoor
[21:42] or maybe Mahnoor is doing some conspiracy which I don't know
[21:47] mom, this mother son duo is quite weird
[21:52] what's the bad quality in that guy? He is just like a diamond
[21:57] and a diamond is also a stone
[21:59] what was the need for you to give him my number?
[22:02] he has made my life a living hell! Messages & calls at all times
[22:06] and if I don't reply a bit then he starts complaining
[22:16] do you know what was he saying to me? that I didn't gave him any attention
[22:20] mom, how come I would have given him attention in the presence of a lot of people?
[22:23] he is right, try to take care of your phone
[22:28] nowadays girls don't spare their fiance
[22:35] Aima listen, try to control him
[22:40] this way he will stay under your control after marriage
[22:43] the way Mahnoor has controlled Faraz
[22:47] mom, what are you saying?
[22:50] there should be understanding in a marriage, the way sister Mahnoor & brother Faraz have
[22:56] controlling isn't called marriage
[22:59] here comes her advice...
[23:12] mom... come here quickly
[23:17] what happen?
look at this
[23:19] 50 lacs!
wow!
[23:23] oh my God! now this house is ours also these 50 lacs are ours
[23:32] now I can leave Saqlain anytime
[23:36] by the way, haven't we left such a filthy rich guy like Saqlain so easily?
[23:42] but we have to get rid of him now
[23:46] before he gets to know about the fake pregnancy
[23:50] although I am enjoying a lot in making Saqlain a fool
[23:55] what do you say? Shall we carry on with this game for some more time?
[24:02] I mean, why shall we leave them so easily?
[24:08] As it is...
[24:11] how can I forget?
[24:13] that I have to get Areeba divorced
[24:17] I still remember, how this woman had ousted me from her house after insulting me so badly
[24:24] I won't let them stay together anymore
[24:27] Saqlain will live alone for life time
[24:38] hey! this is Saqlain's car horn
[24:41] let me go & check after keeping the bag
[24:44] go, keep it safely
Ok, I am going from here
[24:59] you! at this time?
[25:00] why? Can't I come at this time?
[25:03] No, I mean you had visited in the afternoon
[25:06] and you visit only once
[25:08] and sometimes you don't even visit
[25:14] I will remove this complain of yours today
[25:17] what do you mean?
[25:19] I mean, I will stay with you for a few days
[25:23] really!
[25:24] are you serious? this is such a good thing
[25:29] lets go
[25:46] sister...
[25:54] sister...
[25:57] sister...
madam, he will break the windows
[26:00] do one thing, call the police
[26:02] what will we do after calling the police? The police is always involved with these robbers
[26:07] how come we fight the police & robbers all alone?
[26:12] let me call Saqlain
[26:21] Saqlain, please don't disconnect the call. Some robbers are breaking our house windows
[26:30] No, I promise you. Mahnoor won't say anything to you, she will apologize to you
[26:37] if she won't do this, then I will break my relation with her & I will never meet her
[26:44] please come, we are so scared
[26:48] please come quickly
[27:07] what's the matter, you seem quite happy
[27:12] just like that
[27:16] come
[27:23] it is better to get rid of him as soon as possible
[27:28] what if he humiliates me like Areeba
[27:35] I have to think about it
[27:49] Ramsha & sister Areeba aren't receiving my phone
[27:54] whatsapp!
[27:56] they have blocked me from watsapp too
[27:59] they aren't understanding my point, they don't believe me!
[28:03] how shall I tell them that I am getting worried for them
[28:08] don't know in what condition they must be
[28:23] Mahnoor has put such a big allegation on me
[28:30] she has been crazy!
[28:34] please forget that matter
[28:38] its not so easy to forget it, Areeba
[28:44] Mahnoor has blamed me that I have given poisonous medicines to aunty
[28:52] I will give her poison?
[28:55] who used to consider her as a mother
[29:00] I had never missed my parents in her presence
[29:07] and today, when she is not here then
[29:11] I am feeling, as if once again I've lost my mother
[29:34] you are so courageous
[29:37] you have supported us & given us courage
[29:47] Areeba, I don't have anymore courage
[29:50] Mahnoor has made aunt's death a murder & put the entire blame on me
[29:55] I'm shattered after listening to it
[29:58] I will never forgive Mahnoor for this
[30:02] She is always brain washing Ramsha
[30:07] but...
[30:09] I had never thought that she will say such a thing & will put this blame on you
[30:15] I think its Faraz's conspiracy
[30:21] No brother Saqlain, brother Faraz is such a nice person...
[30:26] how can he do any conspiracy?
[30:30] sister, tell him that when mom was unwell & after her death brother Faraz took very good care of us
[30:35] how he had supported us
[30:37] this is his game!
[30:40] he has attacked from behind!
[30:43] No...
[30:45] what can be Faraz's motive? and why will Mahnoor come into his words?
[30:50] his motive is clear
[30:52] this house & aunt's shops and these properties
[30:58] the shops are Ramsha's
[31:01] and Mahnoor knows this very well
[31:05] and this house...
[31:08] this house belongs to all of us three sisters
[31:11] Mahnoor will get her share after Ramsha's wedding
[31:17] then why is she doing such cheap antics?
[31:19] both of them want to take over everything!
[31:23] by removing me from between, they want to snatch away the right of you guys
[31:28] Faraz wasn't after Mahnoor for no reason
[31:31] he is such a clever person!
[31:35] from day one I had believed that he is after aunt's wealth
[31:40] and you'll see...
[31:43] when Faraz's motive will be completed then...
[31:46] he will leave Mahnoor the same way he had left his first wife
[32:27] in fact not just me but your entire neighborhood knows
[32:29] that nobody can raise their hand on your wife in front of you, but you can oust her from the house
[32:51] Faraz
[32:55] yes mom
[33:01] what happen, why you seem so lost?
[33:06] No, I was just thinking about something
[33:12] what are you thinking?
[33:15] that...
[33:19] when does a person's past leave him?
[33:23] oh dear, one's past doesn't leave itself. One needs to get rid of it
[33:29] by moving on or by forgetting
[33:34] until past related matters will echo in the ears
[33:37] how can one get rid of them?
[33:45] people's words make us face the past somewhere like taunts...
[33:56] oh dear...
[33:58] people are habitual of talking rubbish
[34:03] has anyone said something in your office?
[34:08] No... nobody had said anything
[34:15] then why are you worried?
[34:17] why are you upset? Has Mahnoor said something?
[34:22] No mom, Mahnoor has never talked to me on this topic
[34:30] She isn't among those who add salt to one's wounds, instead she is the one consoling
[34:37] Mahnoor doesn't care about whatever happened in my past
[34:42] dear, even you had shown a lot of leniency towards her
[34:45] its not an easy task to ignore your wife's related matters
[34:54] mom, I won't hear a single word against Mahnoor
[34:57] you also don't say any such thing about Mahnoor
[35:01] otherwise, what will be the difference between you & those people who taunts & humiliates me?
[35:23] shall I make tea for you?
[35:24] No, I am fine
[35:44] I know you are so worried
[35:49] because of Ramsha & sister Areeba
[35:52] but don't you worry at all
[35:55] I will talk to them myself, I will try explaining them
[36:00] there is no use of it
[36:02] because they won't understand
[36:06] brother Saqlain has brain washed Areeba
[36:16] there is a possibility that brother Saqlain is innocent
[36:23] I mean, the medicines can be fake or contaminated
[36:34] look, Saqlain's behavior...
[36:39] his misbehavior & fights with you, all of them are there but...
[36:47] to take someone's life deliberately!
 I don't think so, its quite a big thing
[36:53] Are you talking in brother Saqlain's favor?
[36:58] you are supporting him?
[37:00] No, I am just talking about logic
[37:03] Besides, I don't have any personal enmity with Saqlain. Also, I will never want an innocent person to suffer
[37:09] its the matter of one's great nature
[37:12] however, no matter what not brother Saqlain did with you. To humiliate you & to insult you
[37:17] he had taunted you so badly, also you were hurt
[37:23] but you have never complained
[37:27] you were saying the same thing to aunty as well, right?
[37:30] I had heard it
[37:36] you had said that you will never hide anything from me
[37:41] then why you hid this matter?
[37:46] actually...
[37:48] She is a mother, & nothing can stay hidden from a mother's sight
[37:55] and then
[37:57] its easy to lessen your heart's burden with her
[38:02] but it doesn't mean that I am not close to you, I am so close to you
[38:09] I just thought that you are already so worried, then how can I shift my stress & burden on you
[38:15] Besides, I've been listening to these taunts since years.
[38:17] I'm habitual of listening to the negative things about me
[38:26] do you know?
[38:29] I've learnt one thing in my life
[38:33] never think what does the people say
[38:42] who you are, how you are... and what you are
[38:45] only you know this
[38:50] in this world...
[38:53] no matter what we do, or try to make people happy
[38:58] or to do everything as per people's choice
[39:02] we can never do that
