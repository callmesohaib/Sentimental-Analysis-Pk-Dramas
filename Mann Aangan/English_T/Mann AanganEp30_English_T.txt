[01:11] All of it is my fault.
[01:15] Mother is in this state all because of me.
[01:20] What are you saying?
[01:25] If something happens to mother, then I won't be able to forgive myself for the rest of my life.
[01:33] I asked Mahnoor and Saqlain to take me with them, but they left me there. I wonder how she must be feeling.
[01:43] Sister, stop crying... I'll call sister Mahnoor and ask her how mother is doing.
[01:51] Ask her... may God have mercy!
[02:00] Sister Mahnoor, how's mother, how's she feeling? Talk to sister Areeba, she is a crying mess right now.
[02:10] Mahnoor how's mother?
[02:13] Alright... mother and Ramsha will be at the hospital.
[02:20] Bring my bag, we're going to the hospital. Take care of the house and pray that my mother gets well.
[02:30] I talked to Haris, he'll be here soon. He'll help us out.
[02:37] How can a junior doctor help us?
[02:42] We're present at an expensive private hospital. Doctors take money here and then treat their patients.
[02:51] References are used in government hospitals. There one can get treated for free as well.
[03:00] Auntie's doctor is one of the best doctors in this city. He'll take money from us and treat auntie, that's how simple it is.
[03:13] Sorry, sir, you requested a private room, but we only have a general ward.
But we only want a private room.
[03:20] For that, you'll have to wait. We'll shift your patient from the CCU to the general ward.
[03:35] Greetings...
Greetings to you Haris. How are you?
[03:39] This is Mahnoor.
Greeting sister. Don't worry about it...
[03:45] I just talked to the doctor. Your mother is in a good condition and by tomorrow she'll get her surgery done as well.
[03:52] If God is willing.
I'm here after duty as well, so if you need me, I'm here.
[03:59] Thank you.
There's nothing to thank me for. Is there anything else that I can do?
[04:05] If we could get a private room. We were trying, but the staff said that there is only one place in the ward.
[04:13] We want to shift her there, from the CCU.
Don't worry, we'll shift her to the room soon.
[04:18] I'll talk to the management, they will help you out,
[04:21] Thank you...
Okay.
[05:12] Here you go my dear, your money.
[05:20] Actually, I'm the one at fault. You kept this money with me.
[05:28] I was the one who got greedy.
[05:32] My child has no fault in this... she is innocent.
[05:38] She was helpless in front of my greed. She had to sacrifice her love.
[05:44] If she had loved me, then she would have stood by me.
[05:49] She wouldn't have been happy marrying an older guy.
Who told you that I'm happy?
[05:55] Do you see happiness in my eyes?
You won't be able to stay happy by breaking my heart.
[06:02] I wasted my savings and what did you two do? You betrayed me and left.
[06:08] Ramiz, how can I make you believe that I was not the one at fault?
[06:12] How can I believe that you're telling the truth?
My dear, I'm the one who wronged you...
[06:18] My daughter has no fault in this. To this day she is struggling.
[06:23] And I can't see her struggle. I want to give her happiness.
[06:31] If you can marry...
Are you insane? She is married.
[06:36] We'll take a divorce, will you then marry her? 
[06:43] Saqlain compelled me to marry her, otherwise, I wouldn't have married my daughter to such an old man.
[06:51] I was compelled.
Will he leave Fariya so easily?
[06:55] Why not? We'll go to court if we have to.
[06:59] Ramiz, please help me. I need your support to escape Saqlain.
[07:08] You will help me, right?
I still love you...
[07:13] I wouldn't have complained if you had stood by me and even now if you promise that you won't betray me...
[07:20] then I'm willing to help her.
See Fariya, I told you...
[07:26] that Ramiz is a good man. To this day, he still loves you.
[07:30] My dear, you've forgiven me and I won't forget that for the rest of my life.
[07:37] And, when are you filing the case for the divorce?
[07:41] No, my dear, we can't be hasty. Saqlain is a sly man...
[07:48] we need to take careful steps in moving against him.
[07:53] You two sit down and talk, I'll bring tea.
[08:09] Sure, I'm coming.
[08:14] I need to take care of something important. If there's an emergency call me.
Sure you can go. I'm here.
[08:23] God willing, everything will alright.
I can see that you're with them.
[08:31] Where are Ramsha and Areeba?
[08:33] They went to see mother inside.
[08:37] Alright, I'll be back soon. Ask them not to go home alone. I'll drop them off, once I come back.
[08:47] Mahnoor, please sit down. Your mother will be fine now.
[08:55] I'll go and check in on mother.
They won't allow you inside right now.
[08:58] Once Ramsha and Areeba come back, you can go inside.
[09:02] Right now, please sit here.
[10:24] Your house is very nice.
And we've taken a liking to it as well.
[10:28] We are willing to buy this house and we are willing to pay the price that you're offering.
[10:34] But brother Saqlain we'll need the possession immediately. We don't understand the logic of stretching it out for an entire year.
[10:38] Look, I cannot empty this house before a year. But I will offer you advanced rent for an entire year.
[10:45] Your family can live anywhere on rent, if you're selling this house, then why are you trying to transfer it?
[10:53] This was the final wish of a dying person.
[10:56] The doctors have given up on my mother-in-law. She only has a year and she wants to spend it here.
[11:06] So that's the case.
[11:09] I'm compelled to sell this house. I need money to get her treated.
[11:16] Otherwise, we would never have sold this house.
[11:19] Mr. Waqas, you live abroad. Even if you get possession, you'll just lock it up and leave.
[11:26] A year will go by very quickly.
Alright if you need this...
[11:31] then we accept this condition.
Alright, I'll go ahead and complete the paperwork.
[11:37] Sure... get it done quickly. They need to go to America and I need the money.
[11:43] Don't worry about that, your payment won't be late.
[11:47] I have to leave now.
Sure. Come on...
[11:59] Shakeela... is this all that you're here for?
[12:10] Son...
No auntie, please don't get up.
[12:17] Thank you. You take something as well.
Sure.
[12:33] Please call your daughter.
[12:36] Sure. Please make yourselves at home.
[12:56] Why aren't you ready yet?
[13:00] I am ready, what else am I supposed to do?
Fix your face.
[13:05] Apply some lipstick and put on some earrings. They'll reject you if they see you like this.
[13:12] Let them reject me.
[13:13] I don't want to marry as well.
[13:18] Mahnoor's mother had to get sick today. I asked them both to be here on time.
[13:25] I told them that the suitor was coming today. But Faraz doesn't care about us, all she cares about is his wife.
[13:31] Yes mother you're right. They should have planned that heart attack.
Shut up!
[13:37] Ill-mannered girl.
[13:42] Neither Faraz nor Mahir is home. All of them are busy.
[13:49] I am ready...
Apply some more lipstick.
[13:53] Put on some eye shadow as well. It's getting late, and they have been sitting downstairs for a while.
[14:02] I'm fine... enough!
[14:21] Will your mother get well if you stay worried and starve yourself?
[14:26] If you want to take care of your mother, then you need to take care of yourself.
[14:34] You've been at the hospital for hours. You'll get sick if you don't eat anything.
[14:53] Go home, it's getting late. You haven't rested as well.
[15:00] A suitor was supposed to come today to see Aima.
[15:05] Mother will handle it. It's not like everything will be taken care of in a single day. It's more important for me to stay here with you.
[15:13] Yes but, auntie said that it was important for you to be there.
[15:20] It's alright, don't think about it too much.
[15:27] Will you eat anything? Should I bring something?
[15:50] By God's good grace, the tea is amazing. Did Aima make it?
[15:54] Yes.
I like your daughter very much.
[16:01] By God's good grace, your son is lovely as well.
[16:08] Yes... he had an MBA.
[16:12] That's very good. Aima has the ambition to further his studies as well.
[16:17] Soon she'll take her admission as well. She is just done with her exams.
[16:23] Really... is this your home?
[16:28] Yes... it is. They are well-off people. Her son and his wife are officers as well.
[16:37] That's why your daughter-in-law isn't here. She must still be working.
No...
[16:44] Her mother's sick, she's in the hospital with her.
Alright...
[17:00] We like your daughter very much. We accept this proposal.
[17:17] Tell me whatever your decision is so that we may move things forward.
[17:21] Sure, why not? Give me some time. I'll discuss this with my son Faraz...
[17:29] I'll give you an answer in two days. I've taken a look at your son...
[17:35] I think Faraz should meet him as well.
[17:40] When Shakeela told me, I was satisfied there and then.
[18:01] It seems like she goes shy.
[18:05] Yes, she is very shy.
[18:47] Congratulations, the surgery was successful.
[18:54] Thank God.
[19:02] Thank God... 
[19:09] Doctor, can we meet her?
Not now, we'll keep her under observation, after that you can meet her.
[19:18] Alright...
Excuse me, doctor.
[19:20] Yes?
Is there something to worry about?
[19:23] No... the danger has been avoided. With a little caution, she will spend the rest of her life normally.
[19:34] Thank you, doctor.
[19:41] I told you that she will be fine.
[19:51] What's his problem? He's being nicer than he's expected to be.
[19:57] Either he's very sly, or I made a mistake in understanding him.
[20:04] He's standing in my way.
[20:38] I know you love me very much. I know that.
[20:43] What can I do? I'm compelled as well. Besides you know...
[20:49] that...
[20:54] Give it to me.
I'm very tired today.
[21:03] So you've finally missed me. How's Areeba's mother feeling now?
[21:10] She is fine... you're quite worried about her.
[21:14] Why would I be worried? I thought that you were finally rid of her.
[21:21] But she's still alive.
[21:27] You've not been home for two days. Do you have any idea how worried I was for you?
[21:34] How could I have come? I was in the hospital.
Why have you taken responsibility for both mother and daughter?
[21:39] You bothering yourself day and night. What if you get sick?
[21:49] Don't worry about me so much. Nothing will happen to me.
[21:55] Why shouldn't I worry about you? Who else is there in my life but you?
[22:05] Did you eat?
[22:09] You still haven't eaten anything?
[22:12] Should I serve lunch?
[22:16] Alright...
You care so much for me.
[22:21] And then there's Areeba, she can't see anyone but her mother nowadays.
[22:31] She doesn't take care of me as well. Once I get done with them, I'll leave that entire family for good.
[22:39] Sure do whatever you want. For now, shall I serve lunch?
[22:43] Sure... please...
Will you let me go now?
[23:35] Has the surgery been done on your mother-in-law?
Yes.
[23:41] She was feeling much better. She was shifted to the room just a few moments ago.
[23:49] Mahnoor was very worried.
[24:04] You left home last morning.
[24:08] It's nighttime now and soon as you came home you've started talking about your wife and her mother.
[24:18] Not once you didn't ask about your mother, sister, or brother.
[24:28] Faraz, don't you care about us at all?
[24:33] Why would I be worried about you?
[24:38] What should I have done? There was an emergency and I was needed there.
Like we don't need you.
[24:44] I told you that there was a suitor coming to take a look at Aima.
[24:50] How could I have made the decision alone?
[25:01] You could have refused then. You could have asked them to come later.
[25:12] Mahnoor's mother was fighting life and death. And you wanted me to come here to meet a suitor.
[25:25] You should have talked to Mahnoor.
[25:30] All you can think about is Mahnoor and her family.
[25:37] You have forgotten your mother, sister, and brother.
[25:43] I'm the foolish one who counted on you.
[25:51] Alright... it's my daughter's wedding and I'll do everything myself.
[25:56] Take care of your wife and her family's problems.
[26:03] Now that she's staying at her mother's home, she will take care of her for ten to fifteen days.
[26:08] Why don't you shift there as well?
[26:38] I told you not to worry. This was a minor surgery and now it's done.
[26:44] You have recovered and now you're home as well.
[26:48] It's because of all of your prayers that I'm sitting here with you all.
[26:56] Mother forgive me.
[27:00] I'm very bad, aren't I?
Sister Areeba why are you saying that?
[27:05] Let me speak. I don't know what I said that day, without even thinking about what I was saying.
[27:13] And you...
Areeba...
[27:18] I have wronged you.
Don't say such things, my dear.
[27:23] Don't blame yourself. I have no complaint against you.
[27:31] What I said was out of emotion.
[27:36] I hold Saqlain in the highest regard.
[27:43] There is no comparison between Saqlain and Faraz.
Forget about it, auntie.
[27:48] Why are you thinking about it so much? You're not well, so don't think about such things.
[27:55] Areeba is naive, she speaks without thinking. You should only rest.
[28:48] Sister...
[28:51] Are you leaving?
Yes, I'm going back home.
[28:57] It's been so many days since I went home. I haven't been going to work as well. Faraz has been doing everything alone.
[29:03] He was going to work and he was coming regularly to the hospital as well.
[29:07] That's why, I think I should go home now.
[29:11] But auntie, if you leave, mother will be alone.
[29:15] And I haven't gone to the university in a week. I need to go there.
[29:22] I told you before...
[29:24] I won't explain it to you again.
[29:27] If you bunk your university to go somewhere out with Mahir...
I told you that was only because of an assignment.
[29:34] I promise that from now on I won't do anything like that.
[29:40] You only Mahir from the time you spend with him at university.
[29:43] If not the entire day, I do see him every day for a few hours.
[29:50] I know him very well. His attitude...
[29:55] is very different. I want you to stay away from him.
[30:01] You can go to university. Sister Areeba and I will be here in the morning.
[30:16] Listen...
[30:20] If you want, I'll come with you as well.
[30:25] No, I think you should stay here with your mother.
[30:32] It's not right to leave her alone here with Ramsha right now.
[30:39] You're right.
[30:41] Thank you.
There's nothing to thank for.
[30:45] I'm going home if you need anything. Call me.
[30:49] Sure...
Farewell*
[31:09] Bye...
Farewell.
[31:29] Mother...
Do you see this?
[31:33] This is a new perfume and do you even know its price?
[31:41] How would I know how much this is?
It's almost twenty thousand and I checked it myself online.
[31:50] My God! He purchased a perfume for twenty thousand?
[31:54] I've driven myself crazy saving money...
[32:00] and he can't stop spending stupidly.
[32:05] This is not the only perfume that he is, his closet is filled with them. On top of that, he has five branded shirts that he hasn't even worn once.
[32:18] Mother... how can Mahir afford all this?
[32:24] Where did he get the money from?
[32:29] He gets money from someone by lying to them.
[32:35] It's possible that his friends gave these things to him.
[32:39] You know the university that he studies in is a host to rich kids.
[32:53] Do ask him about where he got the money to buy these expensive things.
[32:59] I'll ask him... now don't bother me.
The slack you cut him has spoiled Mahir.
[33:06] I've given you all so much slack. Not any one of you listen to me.
[33:13] Mahir is an ill-mannered man. He becomes rude when I talk to him about something.
[33:21] And you are competing with him nowadays on who can be the most stubborn.
[33:29] My only child who was great was Faraz.
[33:35] Who always listened to me. Every word I said was an order for him.
[33:40] But ever since he got married and Mahnoor came here...
[33:45] he has changed as well.
[33:51] He doesn't care about his mother as well. For you three I only speak nonsense now.
[34:29] Why did you come back so early? Your mother just came back home, you shouldn't have left her.
[34:36] Ramsha and sister Areeba are their with mother.
[34:41] I haven't been home in a while and I haven't been coming to work as well.
[34:47] The office is fine.
[34:52] How long will you handle everything?
Besides...
[34:57] in the end, I have to do everything.
I was only saying it because you would be worried for your mother.
[35:04] You could have come back when she got a little better.
[35:08] I...
[35:11] Faraz is right.
[35:15] My dear, why did you come back? You should have stayed with your mother.
[35:22] Besides, it's not like you have any responsibility toward your in-laws.
[35:27] You do as you wish. You can come and go as you, please.
[35:36] Mahnoor was forced to stay there and you know that very well.
[35:40] Auntie needs attention after the surgery. She needs Mahnoor.
[35:45] Why? Is she the only one responsible for her mother?
[35:54] Married women are usually worried about their in-laws.
[35:58] But things are different here.
[36:06] If your mother wanted to be served by her daughters...
[36:11] then why did she marry you? She should have kept you with her.
[36:23] Why did you come here?
[36:33] Mahnoor... I apologize on my mother's behalf.
[36:40] No... don't apologize.
[36:46] Are you crying?
[36:49] No.
[36:50] Stop crying, I'll go and talk to mother...
Don't do anything like that.
[36:57] Her complaint is valid.
[37:00] It's my fault. I've not been at home for so many days.
[37:07] It's not her fault.
[37:12] Still, mother shouldn't have talked to you like that.
[37:19] I'm not hurt.
[37:22] I'm just a little worried.
[37:40] Please don't cry.
[37:49] I can't handle anything. I try to manage everything...
[37:59] but in the end, everything I do is wrong.
[38:03] Please don't cry. I can't see you like this.
