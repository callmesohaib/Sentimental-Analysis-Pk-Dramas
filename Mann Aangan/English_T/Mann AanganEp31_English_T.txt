[01:15] Sister in law! Tell me about your mother's health.
[01:20] She is better.
[01:22] I wanted to go and ask about your mother's health with my mother but..
[01:28] Your mother will soon be safe and healthy. Don't you worry.
[01:32] Surely! Do pray for her.
[01:37] Sure!
[01:38] Listen! Go ask your mother that what should I cook for today. I'll start preparing it.
[01:44] You came back after so long. You look so tired!
[01:48] Me and mother will manage the food ourselves. Don't you worry about it. Take care of yourself.
[01:53] No! I'm totally fine. I'm not tired.
[01:56] You and aunt are always working. I should fulfill my duty in this house too.
[02:02] Go and ask aunt about the food! I'll start preparing it then.
[02:06] Fine! I'll help you too.
[02:09] No! There's no need.
[03:05] Maheer! Come. Where are you?
[03:14] Sure! I'm here.
[03:16] Eat!
[03:23] Whoever finds us alone like this! I don't know what would they think of us.
[03:28] So? What's the problem?
[03:31] That your sister...
[03:57] What happened?
[03:59] Why did you stop?
[04:00] It's nothing! I'm taking it.
[04:08] I thought that you might leave to meet your friends. It's great that you joined us to eat.
[04:27] Water.
[04:37] Mother! I'll be back in a bit.
[04:40] Food?
[04:41] I'll be back.
[04:45] What's so important to him?
[04:49] How is aunt?
[04:50] She is feeling better.
[04:53] Is she awake?
[04:54] She is sleeping!
[04:59] Are you home?
[05:00] Why?
[05:02] I'm just asking.
[05:05] It's been days since you are looking after my mother in the hospital. You would be tired.
[05:12] That's why I wanted to leave with you.
[05:18] I won't call and disturb you.
[05:22] Take care!
[05:24] Goodbye!
[05:28] This lady gives me a headache by her inquiries.
[05:32] I'm sorry! I know that you are feeling bad but my aunt is sick so it's my duty to ask about her. Please understand.
[05:40] Fine! Now I'll switch off my phone so nobody disturbs us. Happy?
[05:46] It would be so great if this old lady dies.
[05:51] She'll die soon. She has passed her age.
[05:56] Its good that aunt is sick and Areeba is looking after her. Now I can spend time with you.
[06:02] Wow! I'm so lucky. I'm so dependent on Areeba.
[06:08] I mean that you are spending time with me because of Areeba.
[06:12] Come on. Don't spoil your mood. We are here for a dinner. Please enjoy!
[06:56] Should I talk to Faraz and tell him about Maheer? No.
[07:04] I should not discuss it with him. Both the brothers might fight each other. I'll be blamed later.
[07:13] My goal is to tell Rimsha about the activities of Maheer. If she understands me, then I don't have to worry about them anymore.
[10:17] How are feeling aunt?
[10:19] I'm better than before, son.
[10:22] I cannot eat the food that has been recommended.
[10:24] Don't worry about it! I've asked the doctor about it. It's just for some weeks. You'll shift back to your normal diet after some days.
[10:33] Mother! Doctor has said it. You'll soon be able to eat your normal diet too.
[10:43] Aunt! I needed your signatures on these papers.
[10:48] What are they about?
[10:50] It's for the house! It's sold.
[10:54] You got some papers signed by mother few days ago.
[10:57] Those papers were to clarify that I can sell and buy a house on the behalf of aunt.
[11:04] But the property belongs to aunt and she needs to sign these to transfer it.
[11:09] You can read them yourself.
But the property belongs to aunt and she needs to sign these to transfer it.
[11:09] You can read them yourself.
[11:12] Sure!
[11:13] No need to.
[11:15] You are doing everything for this house and everybody knows it.
[11:19] No! Let Mahnoor see it. She might not believe me.
[11:25] Here! These are the details. This amount will be shifted in aunt's account tomorrow.
[11:32] I'm free of this headache.
[11:40] The deal of that house happened so quick because of you.
[11:44] All the matters of this house are going great because of you.
[11:51] If I don't do it then who else will?
[11:56] Hello! Yes Rimsha?
[12:00] What do you mean?
[12:04] Wait a minute. Saqlain! Can you pick Rimsha?
[12:08] Her driver didn't pick her.
[12:11] I would've picked her myself but I'm getting late from my office.
[12:14] What's there to worry about? Your brother in law, Maheer? Didn't he attend the university today?
[12:23] Tell him to drop Rimsha. He has helped her before.
[12:27] Rimsha! I'll pick you. We don't need to ask a stranger for help when we can help ourselves.
[12:34] OK!
[12:36] Mother! I'll go pick Rimsha.
[12:38] Leave it! I'll pick her myself. You are getting late.
[12:40] Aunt! Sign these papers, so that I can go and pick Rimsha.
[12:46] Here! 
[12:55] Fine! I'll go now. Goodbye!
[13:04] I've told you so many times to read the papers yourself.
[13:07] Why darling? Saqlain has read the papers himself already.
[13:12] Saqlain?
[13:25] What about your studies?
[13:28] I'm doing fine.
[13:29] Why are you talking so lazily? I hope you won't fail.
[13:36] No! I'll surely pass my exams. My routine is bad from some days. I can't attend my university.
[13:44] My exams are near too. I cannot handle the stress.
[13:48] You would've missed your notes! Why don't you get some help from your class fellows?
[13:54] What's his name? Maheer? He is in your university too?
[14:00] Why don't you ask him for help?
[14:05] We have a relation with him because of Mahnoor.
[14:08] Tell me about his progress.
[14:11] He is good in studies.
[14:13] In fact! He is the most brilliant student in our class.
[14:18] He helps me out! He helps everyone in the class.
[14:25] This means that he is a nice guy. People who help others are really rare.
[14:33] Its hard to find such people today! Are you friends with him?
[14:38] No! Why would I be friends with him? I don't have any male friends.
[14:44] Fine!
[14:47] Manage your notes on time. Don't get failed! Take it easy and don't stress.
[15:19] Yes! I've conversed. We have made an order list after confirming it from them.
[15:26] Mahnoor ma'am is not in her office right now.
[15:29] I'll get her signs after she comes! I cannot send you the list before getting her approval.
[15:37] She isn't physically present here! You should get the check ready so that we can send the order.
[15:51] Sir! Why are you stressing yourself? These finance companies never listen to us.
[15:56] You are right my friend.
[15:58] These finance companies don't like to give away the money.
[16:01] They think that the money belongs to them.
[16:05] He was right too.
[16:08] Without the signs of Mahnoor ma'am, the manager won't sign the check.
[16:13] I'll get her signs after she reaches. I just want to send the materials order today.
[16:22] Sir! You are so hardworking. You work for yourself too. You even handle the work of Mahnoor ma'am.
[16:29] Sir! Will ma'am credit you for this and put you in the list of appraisals for this year? She should talk about your promotion.
[16:39] You are working hard these days.
[16:42] Promotion gets sir the seat of Mahnoor ma'am.
[16:46] Why would she hand over her seat to him? It's not fare to her.
[16:50] She wouldn't give her power or position to somebody else.
[16:53] I'm not talking about somebody else.
[16:55] Faraz sir is her husband. She can give her position to him at any point.
[17:01] Faraz sir also works in her office too.
[17:05] Can't you guys mind your own business? Is it important to talk about something foolish?
[17:10] Pay attention on your official work here.
[17:21] Looks like our discussion hurt him directly on his heart.
[17:26] Act mature.
[17:28] Yes! Mother is fine. I just reached the office.
[17:31] No problem! Send the file. I'll sign it.
[17:34] Thank you!
[17:44] Come in.
[17:57] Here!
[18:08] I've made a big mistake.
[18:10] I should have handed over my authority to someone else before applying for a leave.
[18:14] I'll ask Ruqqiya to type a notification for the office that my authority will be handled by you in my absence.
[18:21] You can directly get an approval from the general manager.
[18:25] Sure! That'll be great.
[18:33] Faraz!
[18:35] I've got this appraisal sheet.
[18:40] I've to describe the performance of our department from last year.
[18:45] I was thinking that I should not fill this form from your side.
[18:54] Why?
[18:58] I mean that you are the head of department. Who else would fill this form?
[19:04] Yes! But before it was something else. You are my husband now.
[19:13] I don't want my opinion to be judged later.
[19:21] You are handling my work from some weeks too.
[19:28] If it was not you! I wouldn't have been able to get a leave from the office and have a peaceful mind. You took care of everything behind me.
[19:37] The amount of work you've done! I don't think that there's enough space to write about it on this form.
[19:44] Then please write the main details about me.
[19:50] I'm supporting you Mahnoor.
[19:55] Not because I'm greedy for the promotion.
[20:08] You can write the truth about me! So nobody questions you later.
[20:16] I work in this company!
[20:21] I just take the salary! It's my right!
[20:27] The things that I'm trying to facilitate my wife with. I don't want the results from this company.
[20:42] Whatever! Today I have to join mother on an invitation. I'll leave early.
[20:51] Should I join too?
[20:52] Sure! Why not. You should come with us too. You should meet them. Mother was impressed by them. Let's judge them today.
[21:05] Sure!
[21:24] My daughter looks so beautiful today. You look fresh from the day Ramiz came in your life.
[21:32] Remember! Don't get weak in your relation. You might turn out like Ramiz or Saqlain. It's up to you.
[21:42] You can be weak! But you cannot be stupid.
[21:48] They both are stupid.
[21:53] Ramiz is outside! I'll go now.
[21:55] What if Saqlain comes? What should I tell him about you?
[21:58] Mother! What's wrong? You can tell him that I went for shopping. Don't take tension. He told me that he is busy today.
[22:08] That's why I planned something with Ramiz.
[22:10] Fine! Then go. But remember one thing that you should earn something from him before Saqlain finds out about this relation.
[22:23] I will.
[22:26] Go! He'll be waiting.
[23:56] Hey! Please take something to eat.
[24:00] Sure! I'll take it.
[24:08] Your house is really beautiful.
[24:11] Thank you! Whatever we have, It all belongs to our Yasir.
[24:16] Just know that our main asset is Yasir.
[24:22] Father of Yasir?
[24:24] He is in Doha!
[24:26] He wanted Yasir to fly to him after completing his degree.
[24:32] What would I do after moving to Doha? I have the best job right here in Pakistan. In fact I want my father to come back too. No need to stay there.
[24:41] Yes! Overseas is overseas. It doesn't matter that you earn in millions.
[24:51] Why don't you guys move to Doha?
[24:56] I mean that Yasir's father is also there and you guys can get settled there properly. Why don't you guys?
[25:05] Because of my studies.
[25:07] We lived there before! Yasir had to continue his studies so we got a house here and got settled here.
[25:15] Now we are trying to call his father back too.
[25:21] You didn't tell us about the approval.
[25:26] Yes! We actually..
[25:34] I told you already that I approve.
[25:44] We have seen everything and talked about everything. I'm happy with this relation. You can decide the date of engagement.
[25:57] I'm so happy after listening this! It's time for us to congratulate each other on this relation. Eat some sweets.
[26:03] Sure!
[27:19] How did you feel? I mean did you like meeting Yasir and his family?
[27:27] Do you think that Yasir is a match for my sister?
[27:32] Why are you asking me?
[27:35] Don't you approve it?
[27:37] No! I'm just asking you for an opinion.
[27:42] Listen! Aunt has already decided. She has approved it.
[27:51] What's the need for my opinion.
[27:54] I didn't expect mother to decide so quickly.
[28:01] I thought that we are just going to meet them! But mother decided to approve it.
[28:09] You are thinking a lot! Yasir looked like a decent guy and he was well educated. He is good looking.
[28:18] The match is perfect.
[28:24] I don't know but I think they were faking themselves.
[28:30] It seems like they just got money in their hands.
[28:34] Their behavior looked so artificial.
[28:41] It seemed like they were trying to impress us.
[28:48] You are right! I did notice it. They were trying to impress us. Maybe because it was our first meeting so that's why they were trying hard.
[29:01] Maybe next time when they come, everything will be normal.
[29:06] I wish it happens.
[29:10] So I'm gonna go and visit my mother! It's my lunch break.
[29:16] You should come as well! She was asking about you.
[29:19] Sure! I'm free as well. We ca go. We'll take something for home too.
[29:26] Mother is eating the prescribed food.
[29:30] We'll take something for Rimsha and take some healthy fruits for mother.
[29:34] Sure! Let's go.
[29:51] Aunt! Rimsha isn't back yet?
[29:53] She'll be back soon. I talked to her on phone. She told me that she is on the way.
[30:04] There she is.
[30:09] Greetings mother!  Greetings Saqlain!
[30:15] Greetings!
[30:17] Your university ends at 1:30.
[30:20] Where were you?
[30:33] Wow! Mahnoor is here too.
[30:41] How are you Mahnoor? Your little sister just reached home.
[30:46] Would you like to ask her about her whereabouts?
[30:51] Saqlain! I got late due to my extra class.
[30:58] Really? Which extra class?
[31:13] It was Rimsha's accounting class! I know about it.
[31:24] Why didn't anybody tell me about it?
[31:28] Actually! She missed a lot of her classes. She is attending the extra class to cover her syllabus.
[31:37] Faraz! Come and sit please.
[31:43] Greetings!  Greetings!
[31:45] Sit down.
[31:46] Thank you.
[31:59] You visited after so long.
[32:01] Yes! Actually I was busy with my official work. That's why.
[32:06] I'm stunned Mahnoor! You pressurize your own husband after being a boss in the company.
[32:22] She gets her work done by you. Doesn't she enjoy her job?
[32:29] No! It's nothing like that Saqlain. I'm just stressed because of an ongoing project in the company. I'm working hard on it.
[32:39] Faraz! I've noted that you are a hard working man. Nobody really cares for a hard working man. The boss of the company takes the credit after all.
[33:04] In your case, you'll get the credit for your hard work back to you because your boss is your own wife Mahnoor.
[33:22] How do you feel calling your own wife a ma'am in your office?
[33:31] It's funny for me.
[33:42] Yes! Sometimes I laugh too.
[33:50] Rimsha! We brought food for you.
[34:01] Rimsha had her lunch.
[34:16] She doesn't leave her stomach empty for that long. She would've eaten something. Right?
[34:56] I think she is upset now! You scolded her a little too much.
[35:02] Mahnoor! Go look after her.
[35:06] I'll go see her!
[35:20] Where were you? Why did you come back so late?
[35:25] You went with Maheer again?
[35:28] No! I was in the university. A class fellow organized a party. That's why I got late.
[35:37] Why did you lie to Saqlain?
[35:40] He would've badly scolded me if I had told him about a party instead of my class. 
[35:46] Rimsha! I'm getting scared by your actions. I don't know what are you up to.
[35:51] I think that I should let you go! The way that Saqlain and Areeba want to handle you, I should let them because you won't listen to me.
[36:01] Sister! I'm telling the truth that I was in university and I was not with Maheer.
[36:09] I can understand your truth and lies.
[36:14] You should get back on track. I'm warning you.
[36:27] Aunt! I'll go now. Mahnoor and Faraz are here for you.
[36:33] You just came! Sit for a bit.
[36:37] Saqlain! Please sit with us. Lets have a chat.
[36:42] I don't have that much free time to have a chat.
[36:49] I just came here to pick up the bill. I'll get it paid.
[36:55] Aunt! The bill is more than average.
[36:57] Electricity is expensive now.
[37:04] Why don't you pay the bill online? Bills can be payed online nowadays.
[37:13] Oh! I didn't know that we can pay the bill online.
[37:19] It's good that you told me. You are a smart man.
[37:25] If you don't know, then give it to me. I'll get it paid.
[37:31] No need to! You've told me. I'll look for it myself.
[37:44] Aunt! I'll leave.
[37:55] See this.
[38:00] What's with you? Why are you so lazy? See this.
[38:05] I'm thinking of giving this to your mother in law. I'm also thinking to give some piece of gold on your engagement.
[38:17] Mother! What's wrong with you? You said it yourself that I can take admission. Why are you getting me engaged so early.
[38:26] I just said it, but I won't let such a great proposal slide because of your studies.
[38:35] What is so special in them?
[38:38] You haven't seen there house yet! That's why you are getting irritated. You'll realize when you visit them.
[38:50] When you see that house, your eyes won't blink! You'll thank me for not letting you study and getting you married so quickly.
[39:03] Suggest me something at least.
[39:06] You won't listen to me.
[39:17] Maheer!
[39:20] Yes?
[39:21] I want to talk to you.
[39:24] Speak!
[39:25] Don't mind! I don't have an issue with you or your lifestyle.
[39:32] I don't hate you! You are a good guy but I have a request.
[39:40] Please stay away from Rimsha! She is not your type.
[39:43] You are thinking wrong.
[39:46] I don't have an objection but Rimsha cannot afford your friendship.
[39:52] She attends the university to complete her studies. We all want her to focus on her studies.
[39:58] She might leave her studies after getting involved in other activities.
[40:06] I'm just requesting you.
[40:11] You should avoid Rimsha! I didn't talk to Faraz about it, because I don't want a fuss.
[40:20] I hope you understand.
