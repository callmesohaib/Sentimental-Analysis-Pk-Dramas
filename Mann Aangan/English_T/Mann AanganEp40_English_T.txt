[01:15] It's good that he searched me and things got cleared up.
[01:26] Otherwise, I would have been suspected for the rest of my life.
[01:31] I think that maybe she's taking revenge for what happened that day.
What day? Did you two fight?
[01:40] No... he said that she was an officer at the company and maybe didn't want you to be promoted.
[01:50] So she decided to take revenge for it.
[01:59] When one has ill intentions things are dragged on, otherwise, one can just smile and forget about it.
[02:48] Aima...
[02:52] Do you think I alleged Maheer falsely?
You did allege him falsely.
[03:00] I saw him leaving my room.
It's possible that he did leave your room, but the ring was in your possession.
[03:09] Yes but that ring...
Sister...
[03:14] I didn't expect this from you. I didn't expect you to allege someone without checking with yourself first.
[03:21] Sometimes it has happened that I've taken care of your things and given it back to you. Will you make me a thief as well?
[03:29] I respected you. I got to learn something new from you every day, but today I realized that I've made a grave mistake.
[03:40] Maybe mother was right.
Look...
[04:07] The food is great, did you make it?
[04:12] No sister Salma did.
[04:15] Alright. Why isn't Ramsha eating?
[04:20] She's asleep.
So soon?
[04:26] You know how moody she is.
[04:36] She's moody and she must be upset with me as well.
[04:39] Auntie has spoiled Ramsha and Mahnoor with her love.
[04:45] I'm not complaining. All parents shower their children with love.
[04:53] But you're not like your sister. That's why I've given you my life,
[05:03] You're not stubborn, you don't have an ego and you're not childish as well.
[05:14] That's how younger siblings are.
[05:18] The eldest child always deals with the pain of their parents.
[05:28] Nothing like that happened to me.
[05:32] Father married me so soon...
Are you regretting marrying me?
[05:37] Not at all.
[05:40] I feel lucky to have a husband like you.
[05:48] You not only gave me happiness, but you accepted the problems of my family as your own as well...
[05:58] I did that thinking it was my duty...
[06:04] I tried to fulfill my duty.
[06:14] Anyways...
[06:15] I was thinking to ask you to ask Salma to empty aunt's room.
[06:30] Why do you want to empty mother's room?
[06:36] Only till the closets. I was thinking of giving her clothes to the needy.
[06:45] This will only be good for auntie. Be sure to have them taken out tomorrow.
[07:00] Should I give you more rice?
[07:14] Keep it down.
[07:47] Faraz, I've never lied in my life, even if I had to face pain and loss, I've always told the truth.
[07:59] Why do you think that I would allege Maheer falsely? Do you think I'm a liar?
[08:07] You said that you trusted me... what happened to that trust?
[08:14] Have you lost trust in me so quickly?
[08:26] I trust you and I always will.
[08:30] Then why don't you believe me... I'm telling the truth, I saw Maheer leaving my room.
[08:36] Why would I allege Maheer falsely? Is he my enemy, why would I do that Faraz?
[08:43] Alright... that Maheer came into our room, but he didn't have the ring.
[08:51] If you had checked the drawer, this wouldn't have happened.
Why doesn't Maheer accept this?
[08:59] Why doesn't he accept that he was leaving my room?
You're not accepting as well... you haven't still admitted to your mistake.
[09:06] My mistake?
[09:08] Mahnoor, I'm telling you for the past few days to not allege someone without proof.
[09:17] Faraz, what are you saying? You're joining two separate things, that have nothing to do with this.
[09:26] You are very emotional. Try to understand someone's feelings.
[09:35] As far as you saying that I don't trust you. Didn't I check Maheer and his room when you alleged him?
[09:45] Only because you are the one who alleged him.
[09:50] And... I didn't say anything to you as well. I silently heard what mother said.
[10:02] I heard your complaints as well.
[10:06] I listened to them silently.
[10:09] What else do you want from me?
[10:58] Sister Salma.
I'm coming sister Areeba.
[11:06] Yes?
[11:13] Keep all of mother's stuff inside this and had it kept in Saqlain's car.
[11:21] And yes... give me all of mother's important documents.
Sure...
[11:28] I'll give them to Saqlain. I'll come with you and give it to you.
Alright.
[11:41] Ramsha...
[11:47] Yes?
Whatever happened yesterday, shouldn't happen again.
[11:56] From now on you won't see Mahnoor again.
Alright, I won't but...
[12:02] is it good to end your relationship with her?
This is all because of Mahnoor.
[12:09] She has been unjust. If she doesn't apologize, I will keep no ties with her.
[12:18] Sister, that's what brother Faraz and I were trying to explain to sister Mahnoor.
[12:25] But you didn't listen to me... and you got upset. After mother, we sisters are all we have for each other.
[12:34] If we decide to leave each other, then what will happen?
Mahnoor is the one who wants to leave, that's why she's doing this.
[12:46] But I'm telling you very clearly...
[12:50] If she doesn't end this and apologize to my husband...
[12:59] then I will never keep any ties with her and I will think that I only have one sister.
[13:06] You can tell her that.
[13:44] Maheer...
Yes, sister?
[13:52] Maheer, whatever happened yesterday...
Forget what happened yesterday.
[13:57] It doesn't seem nice that you apologize to me.
I know everything.
[14:03] You did all of that on purpose to degrade me. My ring was on the dressing table.
[14:10] You hid my ring inside the drawer so that I may be humiliated in front of everyone.
[14:16] You are so smart... how did you find out so quickly?
[14:21] What will you gain by doing this? You are my brother-in-law...
[14:28] I've never interfered with anyone in your business. You're doing this because I've asked you to stay away from Ramsha, right?
[14:36] You want me to be insulted in front of the family and I may lose the status I have here.
[14:42] I've asked Ramsha to be away from you. You're not good for her.
[14:52] Sister... do you think that you doing all this will make Ramsha stop?
[14:59] Not at all... she followed me, I didn't follow her. She used studying and lectures as excuses...
[15:07] What can I do about that?
I've explained it to her. She won't follow you around anymore.
[15:14] Did she stop?
[15:18] Do you think that these stunts will make me afraid of you? It's not like that at all.
[15:25] If I want I can unveil your truth to Faraz. I can tell him how you lie to him, how you take money from him using your semester fees as an excuse.
[15:33] Even though you're studying there on a scholarship. You also take expensive gifts from Ramsha.
[15:40] What's the big deal with that? Everyone in class gives me expensive gifts because I help them out.
[15:48] Maheer be careful.
[15:50] Faraz is burdened by your semester fees. He works so hard for it but you...
[15:56] But what? Mother knows all of that...
[16:01] If she wanted she could have told brother Faraz. I request you...
[16:06] do not interfere in my matters with brother Faraz, because I don't interfere in your matter.
[16:13] Okay? As far as the fee is concerned...
[16:16] I don't care if brother Faraz doesn't give it to me, I'll take pocket money from his instead,
[16:22] And please, it would be better for you that you stay away from all this.
[16:38] Take this file to miss Mahnoor's office, have it signed by her, and then take it to finance.
[16:44] Madam Mahnoor isn't here yet, I'll keep it at her table. As soon as she comes, I'll have it signed and take it to finance.
[16:53] Alright.
[16:59] Why hasn't Mahnoor come to work yet?
[17:16] Hello Mahnoor, why haven't you come to work yet...
[17:19] Faraz, I will be late to work today. I have something important to take care of.
[17:24] Something important... where are you going?
[17:29] I'm going to the police station to file a report.
[17:33] A report against whom?
Brother Saqlain.
[17:37] What?
[17:39] I'm running late, I'll talk to you later.
Mahnoor, listen to me.
[17:47] What is she trying to do?
[17:53] These are my mother's blood work reports.
[17:57] And this is the lab test for the medicine that she was using.
[18:03] It's apparent that the poison being used in both medicines was the same.
[18:08] My mother's doctor can explain this to you as well. They are willing to testify as well that my mother was poisoned.
[18:17] Who do you think poisoned her?
My brother-in-law, because he was the one who bought the medicine.
[18:25] Your brother-in-law bought the medicine, which means that there was no animosity between the family.
[18:31] Then what need would he have to poison your mother?
No one can do this instead of him.
[18:37] What evidence do you have?
[18:39] These reports are evidence.
We cannot accept this. Firstly, your mother's cause of death...
[18:47] in the death certificate is a heart attack. That means that she wasn't murdered.
[18:54] But someone did try to kill her. Can't the one who poisoned her be arrested?
[19:00] There should be some evidence against that person.
You're not understanding me...
[19:05] Brother Saqlain was the only one who bought the medicine and I suspect that he poisoned my mother.
[19:11] I don't know how you do it, write my report. Arrest brother Saqlain as soon as possible and have this entire method investigated.
[19:19] Is it, not a crime to poison someone in your eyes?
[19:24] It is but...
Why aren't you listening to me then? Should I approach a senior of yours?
[19:31] Whether you involve a senior or a junior, this is my job and I will be the one who will do it.
[19:37] But the truth is that there is no strength in your evidence. But for your satisfaction, we will take that man in custody.
[19:45] To ask questions.
[20:05] How are you?
[20:09] What are you doing at this hour? Is there a set time for me to come home?
[20:15] No, I didn't mean it like that. You told me that you were leaving for something important in the morning, so I thought that you would be late.
[20:23] Yes, it was, but household problems are important as well. Where is this wretched man?
[20:33] Where are you? I'm waiting for you...
[20:38] Alright, hurry up... I don't have much time.
[20:42] I've called a contractor to increase the length of the boundary wall and also to repair the vandalism outside.
[20:42] Who is coming?
I've called a contractor to increase the length of the boundary wall and also to repair the vandalism outside.
[20:42] I've called a contractor to increase the length of the boundary wall and also to repair the vandalism outside.
[20:53] And...
And what?
[20:56] I want to do a little maintenance work. This house hasn't been maintained in a while and since we're living here now, I think we should set it straight.
[21:08] Alright.
[21:12] I think he's here.
[21:26] Brother Saqlain the police are here, they are asking about you.
[21:31] Is your name Saqlain?
[21:35] Yes, I am, what business do you have here?
You'll have to come to the police station with us brother Saqlain...
[21:44] But why? What is my crime?
A report has been filed against you.
[21:50] That's why we're here to arrest you.
Who filed a report against me?
[21:56] Your sister-in-law, Mahnoor.
[22:04] What?
Mahnoor?
[22:08] She filed a report against me, but why?
She states that you are the one who poisoned her mother.
[22:27] She's lying... she's putting allegations about my husband...
[22:34] She's gone insane... my husband has always taken care of my mother. He can't poison her!
[22:42] Wait a minute!
[22:46] Inspector, I'm innocent. These allegations have no base.
[22:51] I've been buying medicine for my mother-in-law. What evidence does she have?
[22:57] You can talk about this in court.... this matter will be discussed there.
[23:04] Our job is to catch the culprit. If you cooperate then it will be kind of you...
[23:10] if not, then we'll have to use force.
[23:14] Alright... I'll come with you.
[23:17] No, you can't take my husband, he's innocent.
Areeba, wait a minute.
[23:21] Listen to me... you know that I'm innocent and the allegations that Mahnoor put on me are baseless, right
[23:28] Yes, I believe you!
Alright then, if you believe my innocence...
[23:34] then there is no need to worry. How much lower will Mahnoor stoop? What more can she do than this?
[23:40] Don't worry...
[23:44] Everything will be fine... until then let everything be.
[23:50] Don't worry...
Take him to the car.
[24:54] What's the matter with you? Why are you making matters complicated?
[24:59] I'm making this matter complicated? This is the most simple solution for this issue.
[25:07] I made a mistake in that I directly fought with brother Saqlain, I should have complained to the police there and then.
[25:14] You have no evidence or witnesses. You filed a report against your brother-in-law based on suspicion.
[25:22] I do have evidence.
[25:26] What evidence? Show it to me.
[25:29] Show me the evidence... is there any video of Saqlain mixing poison with the medicine, or any eye witness.
[25:37] There must be something that you have. Show me.
[25:43] Mahnoor, those reports aren't enough to prove him guilty. You're being stubborn and you're not thinking of the consequences.
[25:57] Saqlain will be released because that evidence isn't enough to prove him guilty. When he comes out he will become your enemy.
[26:06] Your sister will shun you and they will not help you. You will be left alone.
[26:16] Will you leave me as well?
No, I'm with you.
[26:23] But put a place over your heart and tell me, will you be happy leaving both of your sisters, especially Ramsha?
[26:34] You've taken an emotional decision again and you didn't discuss it with me.
[26:40] We can't change what happened, and my decision won't change. Mother always used to silence me...
[26:48] Mother was brother Saqlain's shield and he removed her from his path. And he will have to pay for it.
[27:03] God... the police have taken Saqlain away. How dare you send the police here, Mahnoor?
[27:25] Hello...
Why don't you die?
[27:29] Sister Areeba, you're cursing your sister?
Sisters like you deserve to be cursed.
[27:38] You sent the police to our home!
[27:47] You sent the police here to arrest Saqlain. Have you no shame?
[27:57] Sister Areeba... brother Saqlain was the one...
Not one more word, you should be ashamed of alleging my husband!
[28:06] You will regret this and you will be punished for this.
[28:10] Sister Areeba, please listen to me...
I don't want to listen to you.
[28:16] Listen to one more thing... you're dead to me.
[28:27] My husband's enemy is my enemy. If anything happens to Saqlain...
[28:34] then I will never see for the rest of my life.
[28:38] Do you understand? I will keep no contact with you.
[29:04] That's why I was telling you. Do you see the outcome of this?
[29:09] Did you like seeing your sister crying? Did it not bother you?
[29:14] Did it not bother you hearing your sister wither like that?
[29:19] Mother must have withered with pain like that as well.
You're repeating the same thing!
[29:25] What else should I do? Should I tear up these reports? Should I forget that he poisoned and killed my mother?
[29:36] No... I can't forgive him, nor can I forget it. He will be punished for his crimes!
[29:48] I will never forgive him!
You did what you wanted to.
[29:54] Are you satisfied now?
[30:00] You had your brother-in-law arrested based on suspicion, and I can't do anything about it. But I know the outcome of this.
[30:08] Whatever happens after this, you'll have to accept it.
[30:33] Which pharmacy did you buy the medicine from?
[30:37] I don't remember, there is a lot of medicine from where I purchased those medications.
[30:44] Along with that, I kept tabs on her doctors and her groceries. I did it for many years.
[30:51] If I wanted to kill her I would have added poison to her food, so that it couldn't have been tested.
[30:59] Alright fine... you have cleared your story and your sister-in-law has cleared her story.
[31:04] We'll take you to court tomorrow. Both of you can tell your story tomorrow in front of a judge...
[31:10] after that whatever happens is up to your luck. Siddique!
[31:16] Take Mr. Saqlain to lock up...
Listen to me...
[31:21] Wait a minute... you just can't take him into lock up...
And you are?
[31:30] I'm Mr. Saqlain's lawyer and I have his bail papers. You can check them out.
[31:40] There is one copy for you as well.
[31:55] Alright... Mr. Saqlain you can go.
[32:01] Thank you.
[32:03] Mr. Saqlain we will submit our evidence in court by next week.
[32:09] I know that this case will be dismissed on the first call.
[32:14] Alright.
Thank you very much*
[32:24] You were quite fast.
How can someone keep a person in jail with a weak case like this?
[32:30] I bailed you out in two minutes.
That was very quick.
[32:37] I didn't even have to go inside.
[32:41] Poor Areeba won't get a chance to talk.
[32:45] In this condition, I shouldn't go home.
[32:51] If I go home now, it won't give Areeba a chance to cry and...
[32:57] there will be no hate in her heart for Mahnoor. I'm not going home.
[33:02] Let's party...
Yes, sir, a party is due.
[33:09] Come on let's party.
[34:04] Have some water.
[34:11] I don't want to.
[35:09] Here are your fries.
Thank you.
[35:19] Ramsha... how was your lunch that day?
[35:25] It was fine.
You look worried, is everything okay?
[35:31] Brother was telling me that my sister-in-law wanted to talk to you about something.
[35:37] I thought it was very strange. What was it that they had to take you out to lunch, rather than talking at home?
[35:46] I think my brother was making an excuse. My Sister-in-law didn't want to take me.
[35:51] Right?
No, she wanted to talk to me.
[35:55] Really.. what happened... you look worried.
[36:02] Maheer... sister Mahnoor and brother Saqlain fought.
[36:07] Such a big fight that I can't even tell you how bad. Everything at home is so weird that I can't even tell you.
[36:17] Such is the matter. And I'm trapped between the two.
[36:26] I don't understand what's the matter with my sister-in-law. She alleges anyone when she feels like it.
[36:34] Just yesterday she alleged me of stealing her ring.
[36:40] But in the end, her ring was found in her possession. If this had happened...
[36:46] how would I have faced my brother and my family?
[36:50] Thank God that I wasn't humiliated.
I don't understand...
[36:55] how a sister can allege someone without evidence?
[37:00] I don't know... I thought she was intelligent and sophisticated.
[37:07] But... do you remember that I was the one who forced mother to accept her proposal.
[37:15] Ramsha... I think...
[37:19] she's doing this because I'm friends with you. That's why she doesn't think that I'm good.
[37:28] But Ramsha, in my heart... there is no feeling of friendship with you...
[37:37] Maheer...
I feel very emotional...
[37:42] whenever I think about you.
[37:47] So... that means that you...
[37:52] like me...
Stupid... I became your friend because I liked you.
[38:01] The truth is that I've started loving you.
[38:08] But I feel afraid of how my sister-in-law will react when she learns of this.
[38:18] You need not worry about your sister. I can take my life decisions. I don't need to ask her about everything. I can live my life as per my will, as she does.
[38:31] Hmm... remember those words.
[38:35] And stand by me, when the time comes.
[38:39] Don't worry about it... I'm with you and will never leave your side.
[39:05] Greetings.
[39:16] Aima, what should I make for lunch today?
I don't know.
[39:22] Ask auntie, until then I'll give this glass of water to Faraz.
Why don't you ask yourself?
[39:48] Auntie, what should I make for dinner?
[39:53] There is no need to bother yourself. Do not do anything, go to your room and rest.
[40:02] And listen, be mindful of putting false allegations on us.
[40:16] Auntie, believe me, I saw Maheer leaving my room that day.
[40:26] Greetings*
Do you see Faraz...
[40:29] She started once again, even though her lie was caught that day.
[40:34] I didn't lie, I saw Maheer...
Sure, you did see Maheer...
[40:40] We're all liars and you are the only honest person in this world!
