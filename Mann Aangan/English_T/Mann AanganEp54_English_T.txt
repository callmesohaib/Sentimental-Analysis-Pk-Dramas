[01:32] yes? 
[01:35] say, whatever you wanted to say to me
[01:38] have you forgotten how to respect your elders as soon as you left the the house? 
[01:42] you have also forgotten how to talk to your elder brother
[01:47] greetings!
[01:55] greetings to you too! 
[01:57] how are you?
[02:02] how am I looking to you?
[02:09] you are looking so nice in this luxurious house 
[02:12] do pray for me whenever you offer prayers
[02:17] that because of me you got married into such a house 
[02:22] where you'll spend your entire life in luxuries
[02:26] otherwise that Maheer 
[02:29] what he could give you?
[02:32] nothing!
[02:38] take this
[02:43] talk to your sister Areeba
[02:46] she was getting worried about you
[02:50] and talk to Mahnoor as well
[02:53] what if she calls brother Toqeer & annoy him while searching for you
[02:59] Okay
[03:02] why have you made such a lost face?
[03:05] you are married now
[03:08] in a good family so stay happy
[03:11] brother Toqeer was also complaining to me that you stay quiet & don't talk at all
[03:17] had he complained to you about me?
[03:25] Ramsha, doing a discussion about you isn't complaining
[03:29] he is concerned
[03:31] that's why he had discussed this with me
[03:35] stay happy in your house
[03:37] and be careful about one thing
[03:40] brother Toqeer shouldn't get to know anything about Maheer
[03:45] otherwise my position will be so awkward in front of him
[03:49] I hope you understand
[03:52] what advise you are giving her?
[03:57] what advise a brother can give to her sister?
[04:00] I was explaining her that now she is married
[04:05] so she should stay happy in her house. She should keep her husband happy & she should obey him. That's it!
[04:24] there is no need to take care of her tantrums
[04:27] if she doesn't agrees in a loving manner then be strict with her
[04:32] otherwise she will be spoiled
[04:33] its not in my nature
[04:37] As it is, one should try with love first. Right?
[04:43] sit... lets talk
[04:54] you wanted to discuss something about a problem
[05:04] how is Maheer now?
[05:06] he is better now
[05:08] has the fever got down?
[05:09] yes
[05:10] what did the doctor say?
[05:12] the doctor said, its just a viral
[05:18] my son got unwell due to worries
[05:23] few days ago he was beaten by the police at the police station
[05:27] and since yesterday he is grieving about expelling from the university
[05:33] mom, God willing Maheer will be fine. Don't worry
[05:38] I pray to God that he gets well soon
[05:41] Faraz, what if he gets into depression
[05:48] you should have made him eat something, he hasn't eaten anything since yesterday
[05:52] we have fed him already. He is sleeping now after taking the medicine
[07:15] yes tell me, who are you?
[07:20] is this your house?
[07:24] who are you?
[07:28] my name is Wasay
[07:34] I'm sure you are Saqlain
[07:37] Mahnoor's brother in law
[07:39] oh! So you are Wasay
[07:45] I know you very well although I have never seen you
[07:49] its you whom Mahnoor had an affair with
[07:55] anyways, why you came here?
[07:58] because Mahnoor doesn't live here anymore as she is married
[08:02] I know she is married
[08:05] last time I had dropped her in front of this house
[08:08] really! and when did it happen?
[08:12] look, for God sake stop following her
[08:15] already her life has become so difficult because of you
[08:18] whatever you did with her earlier after that...
I hadn't done anything with Mahnoor
[08:23] isn't she happy in her life?
[08:29] is she in pain?
[08:31] pain!
[08:32] pain is a very small word
[08:36] what!
[08:37] earlier, she got divorced because of you
[08:40] when my cousin Ashir got to know that she had an affair with you
[08:44] He divorced her
[08:48] now think, which man can accept a wife with her boyfriend
[08:53] if this was the matter then why Mahnoor didn't tell me?
[08:59] She was...
you know how stubborn she is
[09:03] she has ruined her life because of her contumacy
[09:09] she got married to such a licentious guy whose name is Faraz
[09:13] in fact, we were thinking that the reason behind the divorce with Ashir is you so..
[09:16] after divorce she'll marry you
but don't know when Faraz had trapped her
[09:21] and today, he is spending a luxurious life on her earning
[09:29] look, I have a request
[09:32] stop following Mahnoor
[09:34] already her life has become a living hell because of you
[09:39] what if her family gets ruined once again after knowing about you
[09:45] if Faraz gets to know about you then... he is such a crazy & mad guy!
[09:50] he used to beat his first wife as well
[09:52] what if after knowing about he starts doing the same things with Mahnoor
[09:57] Mahnoor is living with such a guy!
[10:02] every person doesn't have a good man in their fate
[10:05] the poor girl is so unfortunate
[10:10] Okay, can you please give me her office address?
[10:14] No, I cannot give you her address. I am sorry
[10:18] please I request you
[10:24] I just want to meet Mahnoor once
[10:27] She isn't receiving my call
[10:30] otherwise I wouldn't have come here
[10:33] ok fine, if you are requesting a lot then let me give you her address, but I request you
[10:38] Mahnoor shouldn't get to know that I've told you everything about her life
[10:43] she will get upset with me for no reason
[10:45] don't you worry, I will not tell her
[10:49] write down the address
[11:07] thank you!
[11:09] I really appreciate it
[11:33] you are so bad Saqlain
[11:36] very bad
[11:42] *greetings!*
[11:44] We are Maheer's friends
[11:47] yes, I know
[11:48] We are here to meet Maheer. Is he home right now?
[11:52] Maheer is at home, but actually is not feeling well
[11:55] but you guys please come in
[12:15] do you know who came outside just now?
[12:18] who was it?
[12:21] your sister's old lover, Wasay!
[12:25] what!
[12:27] yes
[12:29] I asked him that why he came here, so he replied that Mahnoor has told him to come here whenever he wants to meet her
[12:37] its impossible!
[12:39] he is lying to you for sure
[12:41] No, its me who is lying to you
[12:45] I haven't said that you are lying
[12:49] Mahnoor can never call him here for the meeting
[12:54] because she knows it very well that we are living here & we can get to know about it
[13:01] your sister Mahnoor is so concerned about our honor. She is quite afraid of you & me, right?
[13:09] and she fears that what if hers or our respect get tarnished
[13:17] do you remember, that day she came back home with some Wasay
[13:21] that madam didn't think for a second that if someone from the neighbors will ask her
[13:28] that you are already married, then who is this guy with whom you are roaming around
[13:35] yes
[13:37] already Mahnoor isn't scared of anyone
[13:40] she meet Wasay secretly and Faraz is unaware of it
[13:47] I've told him to stay away from Mahnoor, because earlier Mahnoor got divorced because of him & then
[13:53] a guy like Faraz became a part of our family
[13:59] otherwise, there is a lot of difference between Faraz & my cousin Ashir
[14:05] his family is a complete gangster's family
[14:13] Ramsha had saved his brother after keeping a condition, otherwise I wouldn't have spared him
[14:18] and today when I met your sister Ramsha at her house. By looking at her face, it feels as if she was mourning
[14:27] did you meet Ramsha?
[14:29] yes
[14:31] I had gone to return her the phone
[14:33] also I requested her that you sisters are dying to talk to you, so kindly call them
[14:41] also I had complain brother Toqeer that he shall give us a bit respect as we are relatives now
[14:47] but that poor guy started complaining about Ramsha
[14:52] oh!
[14:53] what was he complaining about?
[14:55] that Ramsha is always in a bad mood
[15:00] what I should have told him? that she is missing Maheer
[15:05] anyways..
[15:07] I have tried to explain her while begging her to remove Maheer from her heart
[15:11] only this is better for her
[15:17] if I'll talk to her then I'll explain her too
[15:21] as if your sisters listen to you advise
[15:28] by the way Areeba, Wasay is such a rich man
[15:31] he had brought a lot of security with him
[15:35] today when I saw him I felt so sorry
[15:39] I wish I hadn't come in between Mahnoor & Wasay at that time and would have let them got married
[15:44] at least we could have been saved from this Faraz
[15:49] but at that time you were saying that he doing time pass with Mahnoor
[15:54] he is still doing time pass
[15:57] meeting a married woman, isn't time pass?
[16:03] and a married woman
[16:06] meets stranger men then...
[16:10] I feel so ashamed while saying it..
[16:47] Who was at the door?
[16:49] a few of Maheer friends are here. So I've sent them to Maheer's room
[16:55] Okay
[16:57] anyways, its good
[17:00] they'll talk to him & comfort him
[17:04] then maybe there is a possibility that my son gets well
[17:09] He has been so quiet since so many days
[17:15] Mahnoor, please try that the university shall allow him to continue his studies
[17:22] my son's future will be ruined this way
[17:27] dear look I...
[17:30] I beg you
[17:31] aunty please, don't do this
[17:35] I will try that Maheer shall get the readmission on the basis of his academic record
[17:42] I will help you in whatever manner is required, please don't worry
[17:47] thank you so much
[17:49] please don't make me feel guilty by saying this
[17:54] Aima
[18:22] Maheer, what have you made your condition?
[18:25] Maheer, I had called you almost fifty times but you didn't received my single call
[18:30] why aren't you talking to me?
[18:34] are you fine?
[18:45] I had talked to my father about you
[18:52] although he was a bit upset
[18:54] but he said that he'll try
[18:56] upset?
[18:59] but why?
[19:01] because the police came to our house in his absence
[19:04] guard had told him everything that you & Ramsha had stayed at my house
[19:10] so what?
[19:13] Ok tell me, did you get any update on Ramsha? How is she?
[19:19] just now I met your sister-in-law, I felt like asking her about Ramsha
[19:24] but I couldn't gather courage
[19:29] she got married
[19:30] what!
[19:32] what?
[19:39] yes
[19:43] in order to save me from a false case
[19:47] She had married an old man
[19:51] just on his brother-in-law's insistence
[19:56] Maheer, what are you saying?
[19:59] I'm telling the truth
[20:05] whatever injustice is done to her, only I'm responsible for it
[20:15] I feel like killing myself, but what shall I do!
[20:19] I cannot stay alive in this guilt
[20:26] Maheer, why are you holding yourself responsible?
[20:30] you had been in love with her truly, right?
[20:38] and both of you wanted to get married
[20:43] and this is not a sin
[20:45] yes Ansa is right, Ramsha's family did injustice to her as well as with you
[20:51] if there wasn't any case on you then the university wouldn't have taken any step
[21:00] even you are right
[21:03] you are just bearing the consequences of the love that you did with Ramsha
[21:06] who doesn't deserve you, nor Ramsha
[21:39] in order to save me from a false case
[21:43] She had married an old man
[21:47] just on his brother-in-law's insistence
[21:54] whatever injustice is done to her, only I'm responsible for it
[24:16] whose phone it was?
[24:20] nobody's
[24:24] but your phone was ringing
[24:27] actually I was setting the ring tone
[24:35] are you hiding something from me?
[24:38] No, why will I hide anything from you?
[24:44] so why are you getting so nervous, what is the matter?
[24:49] actually...
[24:52] I feel so scared
[24:58] Do you feel scared of me?
[25:02] but why?
[25:06] I love you a lot & take very good care of you
[25:09] why are you scared of me?
[25:23] its just...
[25:26] that I feel so scared of you
[25:32] but I have never been angry on you
[25:36] and pray that a time will never come when I'll become angry on you
[25:44] are you getting me?
[25:52] Ok show me your phone
[25:54] yes?
show me your phone!
[25:57] Ok
[26:05] Sir, your phone has been ringing outside since so long
[26:19] don't come to my room without permission
[26:24] always seek permission!
[26:26] sorry sir, I made a mistake
[26:29] Stupid!
[27:45] how is your mood now?
[27:48] what happened to my mood?
[27:51] that day it was quite bad
[27:55] its not mine but your mood gets off whenever we talk about divorcing Areeba
[28:00] you start scolding me
[28:04] why are you after one thing?
[28:09] there was a time when you were after me
[28:12] and you were restless to get married to me
[28:16] and today!
[28:18] its been a lot of time to our marriage
[28:21] but neither I hold any importance or value in your life
[28:26] what's with you!
[28:29] you are the queen of my heart
[28:33] such dialogues seems nice in the stories
[28:39] in reality, a woman holds importance in a man's life at that time when he accepts her in front of the entire world courageously
[28:52] and Saqlain, you don't have this courage
[28:56] I do have courage
[28:58] if I want, I can tell everyone about you right away
[29:02] your promises are never ending, and my life will end
[29:09] So Fariya, what do you want?
[29:11] I just want you to divorce Areeba
[29:14] and give my right to me, end of discussion!
[29:21] Okay fine, I'll divorce her
[29:23] Besides, whatever work I had with her is already done
[29:28] and I've already made her sisters life a living hell!
[29:31] So, it doesn't make any difference if she exists or not
[29:34] I am concerned about Areeba, her sisters may go to hell!
[29:39] Ok fine, give me a few days. Let me get the divorce papers made, I'll leave her within a few days
[29:47] are you telling the truth?
[29:49] yes, I am
[29:51] Fine then!
[29:52] then call the lawyer in front of me & get the divorce deed ready
[29:58] oh Fariya you...
[29:59] as I said...
[30:03] Ok fine, I'm calling him right away
[30:10] put on the speaker
[30:15] here you go, happy?
[30:22] yes, Saqlain speaking
[30:25] I want you prepare divorce deed for me
[30:35] happy?
[30:36] yes
[30:39] let me bring something for you to eat
[30:44] Okay listen
[30:50] you are really looking like a queen
[30:52] thank you!
[30:55] All praise to God
[30:57] shall I go now?
[30:59] leave me
[31:07] where have I kept the keys!

[31:19] yes, you have to go to my house with me
[31:22] all good?
[31:23] yes, all good
[31:25] Saqlain is getting some important construction work done at home
[31:29] Okay
[31:31] SO we'll stay here for a few days
[31:33] I am thinking to go to my house to get a few important stuff
[31:36] don't know for how many more days I've to stay here. So that I don't face any problem later
[31:43] I had kept my house keys here, but I can't find them
[31:53] look, they are inside the bag
[31:58] let's go
[32:01] We'll come back in a while
[32:03] Okay, lets go
[32:04] let's go! let me call Saqlain
[32:20] Saqlain, I'm going to our house for a while to get a few important things
[32:25] Okay tell me, haven't you asked the labors to work there as of yet?
[32:31] yes... Okay, I'm leaving then

[33:28] Sure?
[33:29] yes
[33:31] promise?
[33:39] promise
[34:14] I've talked to Sir Aleem

[34:20] he gave a very nice response
[34:22] there are 80% chances that brother Yasir will get the job
[34:26] rest he will give the interview then God willing, he will get a job
[34:30] hmm..

[34:53] let me see
[34:54] yes
[37:15] do you have any idea that you've done such a childish act by coming to my office
[37:20] its such an inappropriate act
[37:23] I wanted to meet you, Mahnoor
[37:26] I wanted to talk to you
[37:28] I don't want to meet you or talk to you
[37:31] what do you want? Why are you after ruining my hard earned respect?
[37:35] I had told you clearly that I work in this office along with my husband
[37:39] just now he saw you outside
[37:42] actually, I couldn't see anyone except for you Mahnoor
[37:45] for God sake Wasay, stop talking such emotional things in front of me
[38:07] why don't you get it?
[38:09] I've moved on in my life, and your words doesn't mean anything at all
[38:16] you are not happy in your life, right?
[38:18] who said this to you that I'm not happy
[38:21] your eyes are telling me, Mahnoor
[38:24] that you are suffering a lot
[38:29] that person is not capable enough for you whom you've chosen as your life partner
[38:43] your status is quite high
[38:46] and your husband doesn't matches it a bit
