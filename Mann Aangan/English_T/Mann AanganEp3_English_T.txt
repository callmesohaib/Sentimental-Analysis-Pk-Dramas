[00:58] Did you talk to your family?
[01:00] Not yet, I didn't get the chance to.
[01:05] Tell me, why haven't you still put on that ring?
[01:12] I can't just wear it. I will only wear it...
[01:17] when you come to my home with your parents and put it on me in front of everyone.
[01:23] I will be there with them. Why do you worry about it?
[01:29] I will talk to dad about it.
[01:31] The only thing that I'm worried about is that...
[01:33] your family might have a problem with my family's status or my plans.
[01:41] No, they will not have any problem.
[01:44] Because I'll be standing by you in this matter.
[01:49] There is no need for you to worry.
[01:53] Shall we go?
Let's go.
[01:59] Do you think that there is any girl equal to my caliber?
[02:03] I study abroad, has anyone from your family even gone abroad?
[02:08] I don't understand why you are so stubborn.
[02:11] I admit that no girl in our family is equal to you.
[02:16] But Mahnoor, you can think about her.
[02:20] What's so special about her?
[02:23] And tell me one thing, you dislike sister Areeba so much...
[02:28] You advised Saqlain to divorce her and leave her, but why do you want me to marry her younger sister?
[02:36] I say that out of love for Saqlain.
[02:39] There is no competition between Areeba and Mahnoor.
[02:42] Areeba did private BA, that too after marriage.
[02:46] But Mahnoor is still studying and she intends to do CSS.
[02:52] Think for yourself, how much power you will have if your wife is a government officer?
[02:59] At least take a look at Mahnoor, if you take a liking to her, only then I will move it forward.
[03:04] Otherwise, you can marry a foreigner.
[03:07] I will not marry a foreigner. I will only marry someone who will you choose.
[03:14] I silenced you didn't I? I won't let you marry a foreigner.
[03:25] Even when we keep a dog in our house, we check its breed first.
[03:29] And you want us to not look at the girl's status and family...
Even when we keep a dog in our house, we check its breed first.
[03:31] Even when we keep a dog in our house, we check its breed first.
[03:31] before choosing her as our daughter-in-law. Out of the question.
[03:40] At least keep a little difference... between people and animals.
[03:48] I will decide who I will live with.
[03:56] And I have decided. If I will marry someone then that will be Mahnoor.
[04:05] Alright then. Listen to my decision as well.
[04:09] I and your mother don't like that girl at all.
[04:13] We won't take your proposal there, nor will we be a part of your wedding.
[04:18] The rest is up to you, do whatever you want,
[04:22] Okay... if you two don't want to be a part of my family, then don't.
[04:29] Now I'll do what I want.
[04:32] This wedding will happen without you two.
[04:43] Relax.... relax...
[04:45] He's our only child. What if he marries against our will?
[04:52] He has no idea about this world.
[04:56] Boys his age have gotten married, and their parents have become grandparents.
[05:03] Look at the girl he chose. What kind of people...
[05:11] would get their daughter married to someone whose parents won't be part of the wedding.
[05:15] He has no idea. The thing over which he left this house...
[05:21] is my status.
[05:25] He will learn his lesson and come back, don't worry.
[05:30] Areeba...
Yes?
[05:34] Put this away.
[05:36] Shall I make you tea?
Yes. Did you invite your family?
[05:42] Yes, I've invited mother here.
[05:45] Why are you calling them here, it's your auntie and Hashir we're having a party for.
[05:52] It's alright, this way all of us will get together, besides our families don't get many occasions to see each other.
[05:59] You take such good care of everyone.
[06:04] One has to take care of one's family. Be sure to make Mahnoor's favorite halwa.
[06:12] Sure... I will.
[06:16] Look how much Saqlain cares for Mahnoor, but Mahnoor... anyways...
[06:22] I wonder why that girl has such a shallow heart.
[09:38] Come in...
[09:42] Auntie... auntie!
Coming Saqlain...
[09:51] Greetings*
Bless you.
[09:56] I beg your pardon that we came here uninvited.
What are you saying? I'm happy that you're here.
[10:03] This is your home. Come in and sit.
[10:11] Come in.
[10:15] Sit down.
[10:41] Sister Mahnoor!
[10:52] How come you're back so early from work?
[10:55] I had a headache so I decided to come home early and rest.
[11:00] But it seems that the current circumstances won't allow you to rest.
[11:05] You know whose car this is, right?
[11:08] That means that he's inside as well. Him coming here is no less than dangerous for us.
[11:15] Don't talk too much. If mother hears you, she will scold you again.
[11:29] I have come to you with much hope, please don't refuse.
[11:36] There is no chance of her refusing. Mahnoor won't find...
[11:41] a capable man like Hashir anywhere. Am I right auntie?
Indeed you are.
[11:54] That means that auntie has no objections to this marriage.
[11:58] Your proposal has been accepted.
[12:11] Wait for a minute brother Saqlain.
[12:18] Who are you speaking of?
[12:20] This is Irham, she's here with a proposal for you, from her son Hashir.
[12:26] Saqlain and I...
I reject this proposal.
[12:41] I will not marry him. Thank you, auntie.
[13:12] Saqlain let's go.
Sister Irham listen to me.
[13:27] Auntie... what Mahnoor did was not good. She embarrassed me in front of my auntie.
[13:33] The outcome of this can be very dangerous.
[13:46] There is no competition between Wasay and Hashir.
[13:51] I'm a hundred percent sure that his cousin will be exactly like brother Saqlain.
[13:58] Since when have you been so independent that you've started taking your own decisions?
[14:02] Am I dead?
[14:03] It's not like that...  at least don't let brother Saqlain take this decision for me.
[14:10] What is lacking in Hashir? He's educated and belongs to a good family. Most of all he's Saqlain's cousin.
[14:18] That's the worse thing about him.
[14:21] You fixed sister's marriage by listening to brother Saqlain and his aunt.
[14:26] Don't you know that sister loves someone, tell her sister.
[14:36] You like someone? Who?
[14:41] Mother...
[14:48] Mahi...
Come here.
[14:55] Sit down.
[15:14] You have no idea how much of a spoiled rich brat that man is, whom Mahnoor is hanging out with nowadays.
[15:21] Why didn't you tell mother about it?
I wanted to keep a veil up for Mahnoor.
[15:25] A few days ago I saw them together. I had them inquired.
[15:31] I thought that she was a smart girl.
[15:34] I had no idea that she would play with our respect this way.
[15:39] I was about to do some good for everyone.
[15:41] A simple woman like your mother would never have known who her daughter was hanging out with.
[15:49] I thought Mahnoor was only selfish...
[15:53] but she turned out to be a fool as well. She can't distinguish between good and bad.
[15:59] You have no idea how embarrassed I was in front of auntie and Hashir.
[16:04] It was hard for me to convince them of Mahnoor.
[16:07] Hashir would never even have looked at Mahnoor.
[16:09] I thought that this would have made things better between you and my auntie...
[16:14] Mahnoor's stubbornness and ego always mess things up.
[16:16] Don't worry. I'll tell mother about why Mahnoor refused.
[16:22] I will ask mother not to listen to her. If Mahnoor will marry anyone then that will be Hashir.
[16:28] Only you will be listened to in that house. I will call her right now.
[16:54] I would never have made that shrewd girl my daughter-in-law.
[16:57] Standard education has made her so prideful!
[17:02] She has no respect on how to talk to people.
[17:05] And Saqlain was talking about making her my daughter-in-law.
[17:17] Is there any point in screaming now?
[17:22] When I told you that I had no interest in marrying anyone, why didn't you listen to me?
[17:27] There is no point in over thinking.
[17:30] Mahnoor didn't insult you, she insulted me.
[17:37] Hashir listen to me!
[17:43] I was a fool that I went there with a proposal.
[17:48] I should have asked Saqlain to fix things first.
[17:53] My poor son's heart has been hurt by this.
[17:55] Not only him, but my blood has also been boiling ever since I returned home.
[18:01] Anyways, I will not forget this insult so easily
[18:07] I will talk to Areeba and I will give her a piece of my mind.
[18:11] So that she may tell her mother and sisters. May their blood boil like mine.
[18:28] Mahi...
[18:31] If you wanted to marry someone, then you should have told me.
[18:38] You told Ramsha and didn't even think of asking me.
[18:41] It's not like that, I won't do anything without your approval.
[18:46] I thought that I would tell you after Wasay talks to his parents.
[18:50] I would have told you before they brought a proposal here.
[18:52] You refused Saqlain's aunt's son's proposal so bluntly...
What about brother Saqlain...
[18:58] He was sitting there and finalizing the marriage.
[19:00] You know he wouldn't have listened to either of us. This is a matter of my entire life.
[19:05] He can do whatever he wants, but he can't sacrifice me like this.
What will Saqlain gain from this?
[19:13] Think about it. He wanted good for you and me.
[19:18] That's why he brought a proposal from an educated man, who belonged to a good family. It's because he knew that you are educated.
[19:23] I have no idea what brother Saqlain intends for me.
[19:27] But what I do know is that he can never think of anything good for me.
[19:31] I'll talk to Areeba and Saqlain. I pray that Saqlain isn't too angry because of the insult he faced.
[19:39] Mahi... ask that man to send his parents as soon as possible.
[19:44] So that we may have a substantial reason to reject the proposal.
[19:48] I will talk to him.
Be sure to do that.
[20:38] That's the reason... that's why I'm asking.
[20:43] Wasay... what are you thinking about?
[20:48] Nothing...
Are you listening to me?
[20:52] Of course.
[20:54] I'm listening to you.
[20:56] Tell me, when will you bring your parents home?
[21:01] Very soon.
[21:02] I would never have forced you, but the problem is that we need...
[21:08] a valid reason to reject the proposal brother Saqlain brought.
[21:11] Otherwise, brother Saqlain might use sister Areeba to blackmail us.
[21:19] If that's the case...
[21:24] then what will you do?
[21:29] He can blackmail us ever after we get married.
[21:35] Mahnoor... it's your life, you took the decision.
[21:41] Now you have to stand for it. We will get married.
[21:47] Whether someone agrees with it, or not.
[21:52] No one can stop us from being together.
[21:58] Your coffee is getting cold.
[22:04] Auntie, I apologize to you,
[22:08] I'll talk to mother about this.
[22:11] When mother has no objections...
[22:15] then Mahnoor's refusal means nothing.
[22:18] I went to your mother because of Saqlain.
[22:21] Your sister insulted me so much that I wanted to teach her a lesson over there.
[22:27] How has she educated her daughter?
[22:30] Education means nothing in front of respect.
[22:35] You'll see, both of your younger sisters will stay at home. No one will marry them.
[22:43] Auntie, don't say that.
[22:46] I know that Mahnoor insulted you, she didn't respect me either.
[22:54] You have a lion's heart. I commend you...
[23:00] for staying with her barren daughter. You don't even say a word.
[23:06] They should be falling at your feet, but no, you have no respect over there.
[23:13] They are selfish and shameless people.
[23:25] Who are you calling?
[23:27] I'm calling Saqlain, but he's not picking up.
[23:32] He won't pick up your call now. It's his old way to blackmail you.
[23:38] Areeba isn't picking up either.
[23:40] I fear that they might have fought with each other over this.
[23:45] They surely must have. Why are you calling him? Is there a special reason?
[23:53] Mahi, such a big thing happened. How will I apologize to Saqlain without telling him any details?
[24:01] Apologize to him again?
What else should I do?
[24:08] I have to pay for your foolishness. Tell me...
[24:15] did you talk to that guy? When is he sending his parents here?
[24:20] First, make your daughter and son-in-law agree, then Wasay will bring his parents.
[24:27] I want to see how long brother Saqlain drags this on. I want to see his limit.
[24:35] Don't stress about it, everything will be alright.
[24:41] I'll take a look at lunch.
[25:21] Stop it, why are you torturing yourself by crying so much?
[25:27] Auntie was angry, that's why she said all those things.
[25:30] She said so many things to me as well.
[25:33] Should I start crying like you?
[25:37] She said nothing to you.
[25:40] But she attacked my Achilles heel. She told me that I was barren.
[25:46] Areeba, all of this is happening because of your sister Mahnoor.
[25:50] She's the reason for your anguish.
Auntie says such things often...
[26:02] She also advises you to marry someone else.
[26:07] What's wrong with you?
[26:10] Auntie is not bad at heart.
[26:13] If there was something in her heart would she have taken a proposal for Mahnoor upon my single request?
[26:20] Put yourself in her place, she was so humiliated at your home.
[26:25] Nothing happened because of me.
[26:30] Auntie and you didn't go there because of me.
[26:32] Are you saying that if you were there you would have made Mahnoor agree?
[26:38] Alright then, let's do it that way. You have to turn Mahnoor's no into a yes.
[26:44] I don't care what way you use, I just want her to say yes.
[26:50] Auntie has refused, she won't listen now. She also said that Hashir was very angry
[26:57] Let him be angry. I know how to cheer them both up.
[27:03] Just go to your mother's home and try turning her no into a yes.
[27:12] And yes... tell auntie about that guy as well...
[27:17] She should know why Mahnoor is rejecting the proposal.
I'll talk to mother about it.
[27:28] Enough now, things have been solved. Go wash up and change your clothes.
[28:35] What happened?
[28:38] Are you feeling well?
Yes, I'm fine.
[28:42] Why the long face then?
[28:44] It's nothing...
Look at me.
[28:50] You went with brother Saqlain with my proposal, why did you come back so early?
[28:57] I came back because there was no reason for me to stay there for long.
[29:02] What do you mean?
[29:05] Meaning that Mahnoor rejected the proposal.
[29:31] Miss, should I heat the tea?
No, my dear, this is fine.
[29:40] Will you have some juice?
[29:47] So you've decided that you will not listen to us...
[29:51] You're right not to listen to us. Who are we other than your parents?
[29:59] We didn't do any favors by raising you... we never once ignored a thing you said...
[30:07] We fulfilled all of your desires and...
[30:08] Mom, could you please stop emotionally blackmailing me?
[30:13] I know that you gave me everything. A great education...
[30:20] money... luxury lifestyle and with that...
[30:26] you also gave me the right to take my decisions.
[30:32] When I'm about to make such an important decision, you guys are concerned about status and class.
[30:41] Wasay, you're being emotional. Whoever that girl is, she's very smart.
[30:46] She's making a fool out of you.
[30:49] Mother... you don't know Mahnoor. You've never met her.
[30:53] Wasay, it was your idea to study abroad.
[30:57] And you changed that because of that girl. That girl needs to set herself here...
[31:05] But you're not forced to do that.
[31:09] Why did you compromise? Not once did you think of yourself, or us.
[31:16] You are our only son and all of our desires are attached to you.
[31:21] You broke all our dreams because of the ordinary girl.
[31:26] Mother... Mahnoor is no ordinary girl.
[31:31] You haven't met her and without thinking about it, how can you... I swear...
[31:41] I'm leaving.
[31:46] Wasay! Wasay...
[32:21] You wanted to marry someone.
[32:24] You wanted love. You wanted companionship.
[32:30] Feeling... emotions...
[32:34] are for weak people.
[32:38] I tried explaining that a million times.
[32:43] On mothers say so...
[32:47] you decided to marry.
[32:50] Mr. Hashir Ahmed, a so-called independent and intelligent man...
[32:56] Rejected...
[33:00] All intellectual and famous people were destroyed by love and women.
[33:10] You learned nothing from history.
[33:12] Men who learn nothing from history are doomed to repeat it.
[33:17] Same.
[33:22] Burn these books, they are of no use to you.
[33:25] I'm not angry at her... I'm not angry at mother as well...
[33:34] I'm angry at you Mr. Hashir Ahmed.
[33:39] I will not forgive you until there is the slightest of happiness in that girl's life.
[33:46] You, Mr. Hashir Ahmed, are a disappointment.
[33:52] You are a disappointment.
[34:01] You are a disappointment.
[34:48] Why do I feel that Wasay is hiding something from me?
[34:51] He's stalling me, even though he was in a rush before.
[34:57] Is it that his parents aren't agreeing?
[35:01] No, if that were true, he would have shared it with me.
[35:05] For him, this was not that big a deal.
[35:09] I don't know, such is the circumstance that...
[35:14] every thought I'm having is negative.
[35:31] Doing kindness to you all is like hurting oneself.
[35:36] Who asked brother Saqlain to bless sinners like us? No one asked him to.
[35:44] Do you hear her?
[35:46] Because of her rude behavior, auntie taunted me.
[35:50] I was not rude to anyone, it was my right.
[35:54] And... if I don't want to marry her son, then why is he taking out her frustration on you?
[36:00] You're seeing dreams of palaces and wealth. Why would you take a liking to an honorable man from an honest family?
[36:07] Hashir is no slouch.
[36:10] Wait a minute, who told you that I was dreaming of living in palaces?
[36:22] Now I understand why brother Saqlain decided to marry me to his aunt's son.
[36:30] A man who studies abroad.
[36:32] There always is a reason behind doing anything.
[36:37] They have some of the best proposals, but Saqlain has loyalty toward mother first.
[36:44] I can understand how much Saqlain cares for us. He was thinking of easing our burden.
[36:51] What's with you? I don't understand why daughters are a burden.
[36:56] Daughters aren't burdens...
[36:58] Your father used to say this, daughters aren't burdens, but their responsibilities are.
[37:04] And every parent has the desire to fulfill their children's responsibilities on time.
[37:12] Mother, please... you don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself.
[37:18] Right now, we're worried about you the most. 
[37:21] You've grown so selfish and stubborn that I've started to feel afraid of you.
[37:25] Mother, you think she's smart, right? But she is a fool, who's shooting herself in the foot.
[37:34] Mother...
Areeba, what are you trying to say? I admit...
[37:42] that she refused in front of everyone. She made a mistake.
[37:45] She's making a mistake that is greater than that...
[37:48] By creating a relationship with that spoiled rich brat.
[37:55] When Saqlain told me, my head bowed with shame!
[38:01] Really? This means brother Saqlain has already deemed Wasay with a character certificate. 
[38:07] That means that I'm a characterless girl in his eyes as well.
[38:10] Right mother? Then ask him why he brought a proposal for his characterless sister-in-law.
[38:17] Silence yourself, Mahi. What are you saying Areeba? Mahi said he is a good man.
[38:24] You believe her? That man is making a fool out of her. You can bet me on that.
[38:36] He will never bring a proposal for her.
