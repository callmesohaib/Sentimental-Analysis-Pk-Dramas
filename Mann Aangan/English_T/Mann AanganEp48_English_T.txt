[01:18] Its evening now. And then it'll be night. How is he going to spend the night in prison? What sort of a brother are you?
[01:35] How will he spend the night in jail? You only listen to your wife. You don't care how your mother is feeling.
[01:53] He's your younger brother. What if they hit him?
[02:02] Mom whats wrong? Why are you worried? Faraz told you that he'll go tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Did you count how many hours it will be until tomorrow.
[02:19] It is not as if he's never stayed out of the house. He hung out with his friends for days at a time.
You be quiet.
[02:27] Are you his enemy?
Neither I, nor Faraz are his enemy. Think yourself. Whatever Maheer did is very wrong.
[02:37] He should be punished for it so that he can realize.
He didn't commit a murder. In the police station,
[02:46] God knows what sort of criminals are there. Maheer is crazy. I accept that he is at fault.
[03:00] Aima, talk to Mahnoor. She listens to you. Ask her to tell her brother in law to take the case back.
[03:20] Alright, I'll talk to her in the morning.
No, talk right now.
[03:27] I'll call Saqlain to take the complaint back.
[03:46] His number is off.
What do you think? Will Saqlain and Areeba listen to you?
[04:00] I think Saqlain will never take the complaint back. As much as I know him, he has his chance.
[04:10] He tried to involve me in the case but the inspector was very decent, he understood. But Maheer.. Lets see what happens.
[04:57] Will you get married? Are you stable enough? You haven't finished your studies and you could die thinking of working a job.
[05:53] You were right about him, he's cheap. No man from a respectable family thinks about eloping with someone's sister or daughter and ruin their repitation.
[06:49] Saqlain? Aunt? I was calling you at that time.
[07:01] Actually we were looking for a proposal for Ramsha. You know now that mom is no longer alive, we have to look into everything.
[07:13] Find a good proposal for her. Yes I'll send her pictures to you right away.
[07:22] Alright. You also take care. Bye.
[07:40] Where were you? Your number was off since morning. I was worried.
Why were you worried? I went to office. I have to work.
[07:50] You've been up since last night. You spent the entire night worried. You shouldn't have gone to work.
Really? What should have I done then?
[07:59] You should have gotten some rest. At least get some sleep.
There is no rest or peace in my life. Your sisters have destroyed everything.
[08:07] What could I have done at home? Should I be happy at what your sister did?
[08:18] I just talked to aunty about a proposal for Ramsha. I asked her to find a good proposal for Ramsha and she said she had a few in mind.
[08:29] I've sent her a picture just now.
Yes get her married and be rid of her. I want to be rid of her.
[08:47] Stop instigating Ramsha. If you take Ramsha somewhere outside the university ever again, you'll see the worst of me. She goes to the university to study and you're spoiling her Maheer.
[09:00] What is she saying? Do you have an affair with her sister?
No mom. I don't have an affair. She's only my class fellow.
[09:16] Mom?
Faraz?
[09:20] Please don't cry. I'm going to get him bailed.
Please bring him home. Don't let him be punished.
[09:29] Yes I'm going to bring him. Please eat something.
I'll not eat anything until you bring him home. Bring him home first.
[09:38] Aunty, please eat something. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. You didn't even have tea. Its cold. I'll make some more.
[09:50] No. I don't want to eat anything. Go and give your exam. You're getting late.
You go. Bye.
[10:12] Go and get him.
Yes mom. Please stop crying.
[10:17] Yes, I'll be here and eat something too.
Alright. I'm going. Please eat something until then. I'll bring him.
[10:58] Sorry Mr. Faraz. I cannot bail your brother.
But why inspector? I have his bail documents and Ramsha is home as well.
[11:08] What is the case on Maheer about?
Ramsha is home Mr. Faraz but her family didn't find their jewelry yet.
[11:16] Jewelry?
Its worth 5 million.
[11:21] 5 million?
Your brother stole it from tht girl's house. He has it with himself. We've been asking him but he isn't telling.
[11:31] We cannot let him go without getting the jewelry back. We'll present him in court tomorrow and get body remand as well.
[11:39] Until he tells us where he hid the jewelry, we will not leave him.
We have his bail papers with us. My lawyer.
[11:52] Look at this file. Saqlain's lawyer has taken a stay on your bail. This has canceled your bail.
[12:04] But Inspector do something about it. Please.
I'm sorry.
[12:09] I know you're a very respectable man and you're not at fault. You're worried for your brother but I'm being pressurized from the other end.
[12:19] Tell your brother to tell us about the jewelry so that our pressure eases a little.
[12:28] Please call him. I'll talk to him.
Alright. Go and call that hero.
[12:39] God forbid Areeba, what am I hearing?
What did you hear?
[12:45] I heard Ramsha ran away. Who did she run away with?
[12:50] Who told you?
I went to your neighborhood for someone's proposal today.
[12:56] I wanted to give them the good news about the proposal. We mentioned Ramsha and they told me this.
[13:05] No. Its nothing of that sort. They're just accusing her.
Are they your enemies that they'll accuse you?
[13:14] She was telling me that Saqlain had an argument with her husband and that she heard..
Whats the big deal if Ramsha ran away?
[13:26] She is not the first girl to run away. Take a look at today's newspaper. There are hundreds of such news.
[13:34] Ramsha is innocent. She made a mistake. I'll look into that nosy uncle myself. He loves poking his nose everywhere.
[13:43] And why were you apologizing to God? Is is something unbelievable for you?
It is unbelievable for a person like me.
[13:55] Once a girl is disrepute what could be bigger than that?
We cannot strangle and kill her now.
[14:05] If you have any proposal, tell me if you have any because Areeba said you did.
I do. But they are respectable people.
[14:12] Are we thugs or goons?
Nobody is talking about Saqlain. They are pious people. They will have an inquiry about you.
[14:23] And they are suspicious. They'll insult me and then I will be disrespected.
[14:35] I'll find another proposal for Ramsha and until then, this matter will be hushed as well. I'll leave now.
[14:49] Did you hear her? Get you runaway sister married now. Until we live here, your sister will not get married because everyone in this neighborhood will talk about her.
[15:05] Your sister has blackened our faces. We cannot show our face anywhere and you want to get her married.
[15:30] Faraz...
Maheer..
[15:33] I haven't done anything Maheer. They're hitting me without any reason.
Why did you do this Maheer?
[15:40] Was there no use of me trying to explain you and reprimand you? Do you even know how worried is mom? 
Faraz, you too...
[15:53] Maheer whats done is done. Its irreversible but for God's sake tell me about the jewelry.
[16:02] Where did you hide Ramsha's jewelry?
Why don't you trust me? I didn't steal any jewelry.
[16:10] But what the inspector is saying..
[16:15] Did Ramsha bring any jewelry from home?
[16:21] I don't know whether she brought jewlery or not. I didn't touch her bag. I swear upon mom.
Don't lie and swear upon mom.
[16:34] Why don't you trust me? I know I was angry when I ran away with her but I didn't touch her bag. I didn't know what was in it.
[16:43] Come on take him inside.
Brother please get me out of here. Please.
[16:57] Inspector, don't hit him at least.
We have to be a little strict. We didn't want to touch him but he was acting like a hero.
[17:07] Now we have to teach them a lesson or two.
I understand you're helpless but don't hit him at least.
[17:17] Alright we won't hit him. Tell him to tell us where the jewelry is.
But I just talked to him. He doesn't have the jewelry.
[17:28] He swore on our mother. He isn't lying.
[17:34] What can I say? Criminals stand in front of me everyday and swear upon God knows who and yet they lie.
[18:00] Saqlain, they did come and I put them off.
[18:38] Faraz? Where is Maheer? Didn't you bring him along?
[18:44] Maheer's bail has been canceled.
[18:55] Saqlain's lawyer has taken a stay. Maheer will be appearing in court in a day or two.
What?
[19:03] What sin did my son commit? He didn't murder anyone that they're taking him to court.
[19:12] Maheer is being accused of stealing jewelry worth 5 million.
[19:27] What happened? Didn't you get his bail?
Why are asking him? Ask your brother in law.
[19:36] What happened? Why didn't Maheer get his bail?
[19:44] Saqlain filed an FIR with an accusation that Maheer stole jewelry from Ramsha worth 5 million.
Worth 5 million?
[20:02] But Ramsha didn't have such jewelry. She would have some pieces about half a million. Mom had the rest. She kept them in a locker.
[20:13] And even Areeba and Saqlain know this.
They're accusing him falsely. They just want to hurt him.
[20:23] I will go and talk to Saqlain and ask Ramsha as well. Where did she get such expensive jewelry from?
[20:31] Maheer is swearing that he didn't touch anything of Ramsha's. He says he doesn't know what was in Ramsha's bag.
Bag?
[20:41] But when Ramsha came home she didn't have any bag and neither did Saqlain.
[20:54] Are you sure?
Ramsha's hand was empty and even Saqlain didn't have anything. Maybe they had something in the car.
[21:06] I will go and talk to Saqlain.
I'll come with you.
[21:10] No. You stay here. Saqlain will look at you and get a chance to insult you and I don't like it.
[21:21] I'll go and talk to him and request him. Whats done is done. He should end everything here.
[21:31] He doesn't show you any respect. Whether its you or me, its the same thing. And if someone should request, it should be me. He's my brother.
[21:41] Maheer made a big mistake and he has been punished for it. The police beat him.
[21:52] My child..
Don't worry aunty.
[21:58] Bring my child back. He's being hit because of you. Bring my son back.
[23:12] I heard Ramsha ran away. Who did she run away with? I was in your neighborhood and someone mentioned Ramsha and told me this.
[23:52] What is it? Why are you holding your head?
What else can we do?
[24:02] I was thinking we would find an average proposal with aunty and we'd get Ramsha married and I'd be rid of the problem.
[24:15] But everything has spread now.
And you know now what I was saying? She will go to places and talk about it. Why did you call her home without asking me?
[24:29] My blood will burn thinking that she will now broadcast it to the world.
Then tell me what should I do? I cannot sit idle.
[24:41] I have to get Ramsha married.
What do you have in your hand? What can you do?
[24:52] If she runs away again, then?
That's what I'm afraid of.
[25:01] Right now Maheer is in custody but for how long? What if he contacts Ramsha again when he comes out and she runs away?
[25:20] You were telling me about a proposal that day.
Who? Yes that..
[25:33] Let that be. He is older than her.
Who is he and how do you know him?
[25:41] What do you mean how do I know him? He's a good friend. I'm talking about Touqeer. He came that day and you met him. He was impressed by you.
[25:51] He told me that if I knew a good girl like my wife, someone from a respectable family. He was looking to get married.
[26:01] Touqeer...
Yes. I'm telling you he was impressed by you. I joked and said should I get him married to my sister in law.
[26:15] He is rather elder in age. I thought he might have a family.
No. He's single.
[26:24] He never thought about getting married. Why are you thinking about it? We said no to it. We'll find someone.
[26:35] But we don't know when we find one and how would he be or his family. But before that if your sister runs away. Then..
[26:46] We'll be doomed.
[26:51] By the way, Touqeer wouldn't know about Ramsha.
[27:01] What am I doing? Why am I thinking about it? I'm thinking about Touqeer again and again. You're driving me mad.
[27:44] Hello.
Hello.
[27:47] Where is Areeba?
Come inside please.
[28:22] How are you? Has Saqlain left for work?
Do you both have something to do with him?
[28:30] Yes. Areeba..
What? Do you have another problem?
[28:37] No the problem is same. 
Its good that you came yourself. I wanted to discuss something important about Ramsha.
[28:47] About Ramsha? How is she?
How would I know? I haven't seen her face since last night.
[28:57] What do you mean?
[29:02] You have shut her in a room since yesterday and didn't even check on her. She'll die of hunger.
So what else should I do?
[29:12] Its because of her I cannot eat anything. My husband didn't eat anything. She got us insulted. My husband was insulted.
[29:23] Should I feed her? The one who made us a laughing stock for the world.
You've lost your mind Areeba.
[29:32] Will you take revenge of your disrespect like this? She'll die. She's our younger sister.
Now that you're here, go check up on her.
[29:41] I am trapped here coming here from my home. She made my life hell.
[29:52] Had I not had her responsibility, I wouldn't have come here. We're getting so much disrespect.
[30:00] I called the marriage broker. Do you know the entire neighborhood knows about it? Do you know that woman insulted us?
[30:13] Mahnoor.. Ramsha will not get a good proposal.
[30:27] I'll go check up on Ramsha..
[30:46] Ramsha? Ramsha open your eyes. Ramsha. Salma bring some water. Get up.
[31:01] What have you done to yourself? Here, drink some water.
[31:14] Hurry and get something to eat for her. Right now.
Yes. Sure.
[31:19] I don't want to eat.
Did you look at yourself? If you don't eat, you'll die.
[31:23] Its good if I die. You'll be rid of me.
[31:27] Its nothing of this sort.
It is.
[31:30] Everybody loves you. You made a mistake that's why everyone was.. Try and understand.
[31:40] You leave. I don't want to eat or talk to you. Leave from here. Leave.
[31:58] Eat something.
Don't you understand I don't want to eat? Go.
[32:03] Nobody is going to force you for anything.
[32:12] So they now care about me..
[32:27] Salma, listen to me. Nobody will lock this door and nobody will force Ramsha for anything. You will take care of her diet.
Sure.
[32:38] Don't worry.
How is Ramsha now?
[32:51] Mahnoor and Faraz are here.
What are they here for now?
[32:59] Did you call them?
No I didn't. Its good that they came. We will discuss Ramsha's marriage.
[33:13] Why are you all of a sudden so crazy about Ramsha's wedding? Do boys grow on trees that you'll pluck one and get your sister married?
[33:26] Actually, I was thinking that Touqeer isn't a bad option.
[33:38] I know there is an age gap about 12-15 years but he's a decent man. I'll talk to Mahnoor.
[33:49] See Areeba, I'm not in favor of it but the situation we are in right now, Touqeer is a blessing.
[33:59] And its a good thing. He is a rich and well cultured man. If your sister gets married to him, she'll be happy. He's rich. She'll live her life.
[34:09] And your sister and her dark past. It'll be hidden as well.
[34:19] Oh well. As time goes by she'll forget Maheer. What do you think?
[34:30] So lets go and talk to everyone.
You go ahead. I'll come and yes,
[34:41] don't mention Touqeer in front of me to Mahnoor. She doesn't like my involvement in such things. Talk when I leave.
[34:53] And I think she'll agree too like you have.
[35:01] You go ahead. I'll come.
[35:24] This is good.
[35:44] What happened? Is everything alright? What did you want from me?
Saqlain, I wanted to request you.
[35:54] Yes tell me. Do you want money?
[36:01] No. Please take back the FIR against Maheer.
[36:18] You have canceled the bail as well.
As far as I know Ramsha didn't have such expensive jewelry.
[36:24] Even if she did, it wasn't worth 5 millions. Even Areeba knows that.
[36:34] This means you're trapping Maheer in a false case.
Aren't you having a lot of sympathy for him? Its been less than 24 hours that your sister ran away with him.
[36:46] I am not sympathizing with anyone. I'm just saying why be unfair with anyone? Why are you falsely accusing him?
You're saying that?
[37:00] You're the same who falsely accused me of murder. Remember?
[37:13] Alright. So are you extracting your revenge from me? Fine. Take your revenge from me. Why involve Maheer?
[37:22] I just want to set him straight. I didn't find a false case. Maheer has all of Areeba's jewelry that Ramsha stole and gave him.
[37:37] What? What is he saying Areeba?
Areeba tell Mahnoor how Ramsha stole your jewelry and gave it to Maheer?
[37:52] Tell her something. Its necessary that the boy stays locked up until Ramsha gets married or else she won't marry.
What new thing is this?
[38:03] Ramsha took your jewelry and you didn't tell me.
We didn't know too. We were worried about Ramsha. We found out later.
[38:14] Maheer swore he didn't touch any of Ramsha's things. Check the bag Ramsha had. The jewelry can be still inside it.
[38:30] I have checked that bag. Its empty. Its in my car. Areeba, ask Salma, she'll get that bag.
[38:47] I'll show you. Then you can check it yourself and be satisfied.
