[01:48] Did you go to meet your family?
[01:54] Actually..
[01:56] How dare you set foot out of this house without asking me.
[02:02] I just wanted to meet...
[02:05] You cannot meet your sisters. Do you understand?
[02:10] But why?
[02:16] I don't find it necessary to answer your questions.
[02:18] They're my sisters and its my right to meet them.
[02:21] You will not decide this. 
[02:25] I'm warning you. Don't you dare set foot out of this house without my permission 
[02:30] or else you'll see the worse of me.
[02:36] It seems you don't understand the language of love. 
[02:42] I'll have to teach you the other way.
[02:45] No.
[02:47] I'll do as you say. I'll not leave the house without your permission. Never.
[02:56] I'll do as you say. I'll do as you want.
[03:18] I don't want to be harsh with you. 
[03:23] Even I don't like it myself. 
[03:26] what shall I do?
[03:29] People who interfere in my life, I don't like them. 
[03:33] Just forget your sisters.
[03:38] And understand this well. 
[03:43] I don't like girls who cry and weep. 
[03:49] This is your last day of weeping like this.
[03:54] This shouldn't happen again. 
[03:57] This is a house not a graveyard. Nobody should be mourning here all the time.
[04:04] Do you understand?
[04:18] That's good.
[04:52] Any problem?
[04:56] No. Why would I have a problem? 
[05:00] I'm made of stone.
[05:02] I don't feel pain and I'm not affected by someone's attitude as well.
[05:12] Even I feel the same about myself. 
[05:18] You complain that people think you're made of stone 
[05:22] and I want to be made of stone.
[05:31] I'm tired of being a human and feeling all the pain. I'm fed up.
[05:39] Should I ask you something?
[05:44] Do you really think I have a relation with Wasay?
[05:51] What does my thinking mean? The truth will not change.
[05:56] Is our relation so weak
[06:00]  that you assumed so many things just looking at me with Wasay? 
[06:04] You didn't even give me a chance to explain.
[06:09] I didn't assume anything 
[06:12] but circumstances..
[06:15] Are you doubting me?
No. I'm not doubting you.
[06:19] You don't trust me this is why you're reacting on such a small thing.
[06:23] Is it so small for you? That person and you..
[06:35] You loved that person.
[06:39] Faraz I...
[06:40] Did you love him?
[06:43] Yes I did. But I am no longer with him.
[06:52] He wasn't important to me then nor is he important to me now.  
[06:55] Had this been, why would I marry you? Wasay told me,
[07:00] he told me I could come back to him whenever I wanted but I didn't do that 
[07:07] because I didn't want to leave you.
[07:11] You met him?
[07:15] And you didn't tell me. Why?
[07:18] What difference does it make? 
[07:20] I meet 50,000 people everyday. Do I tell you about everyone?
[07:28] I didn't tell you about Wasay because I didn't want to hurt you. 
[07:33] I knew it that you will mind & he isn't so important to me.
[07:38] brother Saqlain knowingly sent Wasay to my office.
[07:44]  I don't know what he told him just to create misunderstandings between us.
[07:50] And your attitude.. it has proven that brother Saqlain is successful in his motive. 
[07:57] He wanted to create a rift between us and he did it.
[08:07] Your attitude has made me realize that all the time that I was with you, I was just wasting my time.
[08:17] Because you have always supported me but you never trusted me.
[08:31] If you can stop trusting me on one such small thing, 
[08:37] then I think we don't have any reason to continue this relationship.
[08:46] Ever since I'm with you, ever since I got married to you, I've tried my best 
[08:52] to make a place for myself in your heart. 
[08:55] I stood by the relationship with all my loyalties.
[08:58] But you.. 
[09:00] you couldn't even trust me
[09:06] Where there is no trust Faraz..
[09:11] relationships don't sustain here.
[09:36] You're expecting. My guess cannot be wrong.
[09:41]  I know its a very big news for you, that's why I haven't shared this with your husband
[09:52] I have finally received the news I had been waiting for so many years. 
[10:00] But along with that, why did you tilt my world over, God?
[10:11] Oh God, should I be happy today or should I cry for the deceit?
[10:59] Salma?
[11:05] Yes brother Saqlain sir? Did you call me?
Why didn't you serve food?
[11:08] Everything is ready, I'll just serve in a bit.
But Areeba is sleeping, isn't she?
[11:14] Yes she is sleeping.
[11:17] Don't serve dinner yet. I'll eat with Areeba when she wakes up.
[11:22] Alright then.
[11:24] I'm going out for some work. Stay with Areeba. Don't leave her alone.
[11:30] Yes. Don't worry. I'm here.
[11:38] Areeba mam you're up?
[11:41] Where is Saqlain?
[11:44] He just left.
[11:50] Are you going somewhere?
Yes. I'll just come.
[13:52] You're looking very nice today
[13:59] And this?
[14:00] This too.
[14:46] Who could be here at this hour?
[14:50] I don't know who it might be. I'll just go and see.
[14:53] Why would you go and see? I'm here. I'll go and see.
[15:04] What if its Rameez? 
[15:07] Oh God what will happen now?
[15:42] Saqlain who is it?
[15:46] This is the same girl that..
[15:54] but you said she was lying.
[16:00] I didn't lie to you.
[16:09] I am Saqlain's wife.
[16:17] Saqlain, didn't you tell her? Come on tell her who am I to you?
[16:27] Yes she is my wife. I have married her.
[16:36] Such a big lie 
[16:41] Such a big deceit.
[16:51] I thought you were not a human being 
[16:55] but an angel and you..
[16:58] I didn't cheat you. I got married for the second time. I have a right to do so.
[17:06] And that I did because you're a barren woman.
I'm not a barren woman.
[17:25] I am not a barren woman and neither am I not expecting today.
[17:43] I am pregnant.
[18:09] Areeba.. this..
[18:19] Areeba..
Saqlain she's lying to you. She's fooling you. 
[18:23] How can it be after so many years?
[18:24] Areeba doesn't lie to me. Ever. 
[18:29] These lab reports are from the place where I got her tested from. How can these be fake?
[18:34] Fake reports can be made in a couple of thousands.
[18:37] No. This cannot be. This cannot be..
[18:42] Saqlain where are you going? Saqlain? Saqlain listen to me.
[18:53] Saqlain she's lying. She's fooling you.
What happened Fariya?
[19:00] Areeba is expecting. 
[19:02] Its all because of you. If only I hadn't listened to you.
[19:06] Please come inside.
[19:08] I'm very angry. Leave me.
[19:10]  Its all because of you. I shouldn't have listened to you.
Come inside please.
[19:39] What is it? Mahnoor why are you not answering the call?
[19:45] Its an unknown number.
Let me talk.
[19:51] No. Why would you talk? Its an unknown number. I'll just hang up.
[20:19] You're not happy in your life. Your eyes are telling me Mahnoor.
[20:24] They say you're suffering too much.
[21:11] Saqlain, you didn't tell her. Come on tell her who am I?
[21:17] Yes. She's my wife.
[21:19] I married her.
[21:41] I found it in your coat pocket. Who is it for?
[21:45] I wanted to surprise you since so many days.
[21:49] And as it is, who would I buy jewelry, if not for you?
[21:58] When I wanted the number of your Hyderabad office, I found out it didn't exist?
[22:03] If the receptionist told you there's no office, it means I'm lying?
[22:08] Do you think if I want to cheat you I'd go to Hyderabad? 
[22:11] Come I'll show you the office and give you the number.
[22:16] I don't want to go anywhere.
[22:46] Why did Areeba switch off the phone?
[22:57] Nobody is answering at home as well. I hope everything is alright.
[23:09] sister Mahnoor?
Yes.
[23:13] Please come and eat. Dinner is served.
[23:16] No I'm not hungry. You go and eat.
[23:19] Why aren't you hungry? The food was cooked late. Please come.
[23:24] I don't feel like. I am feeling a bit unwell.
[23:28] Oh, what happened to you?
Its nothing. I think its the weather.
[23:32] What happened? I'll tell mom and get you medicine.
[23:35] Please don't tell anyone. They'll be worried.
[23:39] Do one thing, have dinner with everyone. I'm fine.
[23:46] Alright then. Okay.
[24:03] What is the problem? Why isn't anybody answering me? 
[24:07] How should I find out?
[24:30] Areeba, listen to me. Areeba? Areeba? Listen.
[24:40] Areeba? Areeba? Open the door. Areeba.
[24:47] Areeba open the door and listen to me. Whats wrong with you?
[24:58] What sin did I commit? I just married for the second time. Its nothing out of the world.
[25:04] And what will crying get you? 
[25:06] Your condition isn't favorable for this. Take care of your health.
[25:18] Areeba, listen to me..
[25:32] Areeba, lets sit and talk. Nothing should happen to our child. Please listen to me.
[25:48] Areeba.. Areeba, listen to me.
[26:08] Alright, don't open the door.
[26:13] Don't talk to me if you don't want to. I'll leave. I'm leaving.
[27:36] Didn't Mahnoor come?
[27:39] She said she isn't hungry.
[27:42] Its surprising if she isn't hungry yet when will she be? Faraz?
[27:52] Go and call her.
[27:55] If she didn't come when Aima called, why would she come with me?
[28:10] Now I truly believe that something is going on between you two.
[28:21] Mahnoor has been quiet since a few days and she is worried and her eyes are wet ever since she came home today.
[28:38] See Faraz.. The complaints you have with one another.
[28:46] Sit and talk it out. Dear don't hurt each other.
[28:59] Go dear and call her to have dinner with us.
[29:11] Mom I don't think she is worried because of Faraz.
[29:16] What do you mean?
[29:18] I mean there could be issues between them but she is worried about something else as well.
[29:27] Maybe she is worried because of her sister. Maybe because of Ramsha. 
[29:32] Because when I went to her room she was very tensed and calling someone.
[29:45] I'll get water from the kitchen.
[31:26] You have complaints with me then why are you venting out on food?
[31:35] Or.. 
[31:40] do you want to tell everybody about our personal issues?
[31:45] We have differences between us.
[31:49]  But everybody is waiting for you on the dinner table.
[31:58] I'm not hungry. Really.
[32:05] Why?
[32:08] What did you have for lunch?
[32:14] Lunch?
[32:17] I didn't even remember lunch.
[32:24] Where did you go from the office in the morning?
[32:31]  You left without telling anyone.
[32:37] Did you go to meet someone?
[32:45] You must be thinking that I went to meet Wasay.
[32:49]  But its alright. 
[32:52] Once you start doubting someone, you always think like that.
[33:02] If you would have told me where you were going or for what,
[33:09]  I wouldn't have thought about it. But you didn't so this is what I thought.
[33:17] Where did I lack in our relationship
[33:21]  that I haven't earned your trust by now?
[33:28] If not on my character, you should have trusted your love.
[33:40] A girl who you stood by on every difficult step of life, how can she be disloyal to you?
[33:51] Mahnoor I.. I was thinking that a girl like you..
[34:03] Mahnoor, a woman left me for a rich man.
[34:09]  She turned me down and made a spectacle of my respect.
[34:16] You didn't find a difference between her and I?
[34:27] You thought if she could be disloyal to you, I could be too?
[34:37] Did you hear what Wasay said?
[34:39] I did but did he say what I had said?
[34:47] Whatever he said, you heard him. But did you even hear what I answered him?
[34:57] Without listening to me, without hearing my answers, you decided what I wanted to do? 
[35:04] You didn't even give me a chance to explain?
[35:10] I made a mistake.
[35:17] You made a mistake? 
[35:20] But why were you punishing me?
[35:31] I'm sorry.
[35:35] Sorry?
[35:38] What should I say then?
[35:45] I agree I made a mistake. 
[35:48] Now you tell me what should I do?
[35:53]  Should I hold my ears? Please forgive me now.
[36:14] I'm sorry.
[38:29] Sir, I kept knocking for a long time but mam Ramsha didn't open the door.
[38:38] Did you tell her that I was waiting for her at the dinner
[38:40] Yes I did but she said no.
[38:47] Alright. You go.
Okay.
[39:35] Open the door Ramsha..
