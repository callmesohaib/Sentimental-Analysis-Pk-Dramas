[01:21] Mom, I want some money.
Didn't I tell you I don't have money?
[01:25] Mom I just want a little money nothing more. What is wrong with you?
[01:29] Maheer?
Yes brother?
[01:39] What do you think of yourself?
What is wrong with you?
[01:42] Didn't I warn you? Why don't you understand what I say?
Will someone tell me what he did?
[01:48] I have always ignored your mistakes thinking you're at a age where people make stupid mistakes.
[01:56] But you have crossed all limits.
Leave him. Leave him! Talk to me.
[02:02] Whats wrong? Why did you hit him?
He has been planning to elope with Ramsha.
[02:13] No mom. Its not that.
Really? Its not that?
[02:19] Then is Saqlain lying?
[02:21] No. But..
He told Ramsha to run away with him and that he would marry her.
[02:26] It was actually..
You're not even independent and you want to elope with a girl?!
[02:33] Mom..
Be quiet. Now I'll hit you myself. Didn't I warn you that day?
[02:39] I asked you stay away from Mahnoor's sister. Why did you meet her then?
He has had Ramsha disrespected. They have now barred her from going to the university.
[02:46] It is good. As if she went to the university to study. She had been trapping my son.
Aunty please..
[02:53] I will not hear a thing about Ramsha. Maheer trapped Ramsha. I tried my best to stop Maheer but he didn't listen to me.
[03:02] And now he's suggesting her that they should run away and get married.
Really? Am I after her?
[03:08] Mom she isn't a child. She loves me.
I asked you to shut up. I'll break your face.
[03:15] I think he's misusing the freedom we've given him.
Faraz!!
[03:29] Please stop right now. Please. I'll explain him. He'll never look at Ramsha again.
This is best for him.
[03:38] You know I was insulted so much because of him. The words Saqlain used for him.
[03:44] He is after you always. He just needs a chance to argue with you.
Yes but he didn't say anything wrong.
[03:51] He was right about him. He's cheap. Nobody from a decent family thinks this was about any girl. They don't think about running away.
[04:12] Why don't you listen? I warned you that day.
[04:46] You should drown to your death.
What is your problem? Why are you after me?
[04:54] Because your habits are such.
[04:58] Look at me. Were you trying to fool me when Mahnoor said so. You said she was your friend.
[05:06] Where did marriage come from? And will you get married? Can you afford that?
[05:14] You haven't finished your education and thinking about a job kills you.
Mom please stop it.
[05:20] I should stop but you wouldn't. You have sworn to get me insulted in front of Mahnoor and Faraz. 
[05:30] And my poor son had to listen to that wretched Saqlain.
[05:35] God forbid, had their arguments increased. Listen to me with open ears. Throw this stupid idea out of your mind.
[05:45] Keep your love and passion intact and focus on your studies. I'm thinking about your sister's marriage and here you are with your spectacles.
[05:56] You have no realization of responsibilities and yet you want to elope and get married.
[06:31] Mahnoor, I want to apologize to you.
[06:36] Faraz, why are you apologizing?
Because whatever is happening,
[06:44] My younger brother is the reason of that.
But you're not the one at fault here.
[06:49] You..
Of course.
[06:53] If Maheer is being stupid and your sister is infatuated, where is Faraz at fault here?
[07:01] Why is Saqlain taunting him?
[07:05] Mom, please let it be.
How should I let it be? He needs a reason to argue with you.
[07:13] He always insults you without thinking.
[07:21] He didn't insult me only. I had to hear so much because of Maheer's stupidity.
[07:29] And Areeba and Saqlain also taunted Mahnoor.
[07:34] And now what did Mahnoor do to them? She is in fact after Maheer's life.
[07:43] She hides everything her sister does and holds Maheer accountable. God forbid. I don't know how her family is.
[07:55] Mom, now keep this on yourself and think about it.
[08:02] We also have a daughter and sister in our house.
Don't compare her sister to my daughter.
[08:10] Ramsha is just like a sister to me. Just like Aima.
[08:19] And how can Maheer think about running away with Ramsha?
No. He will not do that.
[08:25] He might be acting as a hero. I'm made him understand. Please now you also end it.
[08:34] Finish this off. Give him some cold water so that his anger subsides.
[10:20] Hello Maheer, this is Ramsha?
Ramsha, what is this new mess?
[10:29] You have no idea. Everything has gone haywire. My sister has forbidden me to go to the university.
I know. Your brother in law made a mountain out of a molehill.
[10:40] What do you mean? Did Faraz say something to you?
Say? I had a fight with him.
[10:49] Your sister accused me in front of my mom and brother. You cannot even think about it.
[10:55] My sister?
Yes. Faraz and mom, both of them hit me for the first time in my life.
[11:05] And all this, I tolerated because of you.
[11:12] Then? What should I do? You tell me. I don't know what to do.
[11:17] I'll think about something and tell you. Right now I'm upset myself.
[11:24] Please take care of yourself and keep your phone with you. Don't let your family take your phone away. I won't be able to contact you then.
[11:33] Don't worry. I'll keep my phone safe somewhere. My sister won't even find it.
[11:44] Bye.
Alright. Bye.
[12:48] Where is your phone?
[12:52] I don't have it.
Give it to me. Where have you kept it? Bring it out.
[12:55] Don't you remember my screen cracked? I gave it for repair when Saqlain gave me the money.
[13:06] Had mom been alive, she would have gotten a heart attack because of you. You've made my life, a living hell.
[13:36] What happened? Did she give you the phone?
She said she gave it for repairing. Her screen had cracked.
[13:43] But that.. Alright. Its good she doesn't have a phone.
[13:54] Its good that she won't be able to talk to Maheer.
Hmm. I'm thinking that,
[14:06] we should get her married.
We will. But we need time to find a proposal. Its not easy to find one.
[14:20] I'll ask aunt Yasmeen. Mom asked her for Mahnoor as well.
[14:28] Tell me one thing. How many proposals she brought for Mahnoor? As far as I remember she would take money every week and couldn't find a decent proposal.
[14:39] You know what Mahnoor's issue was.
Your sister isn't a pious character as well. The entire neighborhood knows about her.
[14:49] Remember the letter. First she had a boy stalking her. Then someone jumped intruded the house and broke the glass.
[14:58] And there is a different scene in the university.
[15:06] Both your sisters have created hell.
[15:13] I am ashamed. I want to drown myself.
Why are you saying like this?
[15:21] How else should I say it? Think about it. What will we do if Ramsha runs away with Maheer? Think.
[15:29] We will have no option other than suicide. The world will not let us live because we took Ramsha's responsibility. Think.
[16:16] Who are you calling?
Areeba. I don't know where Ramsha is.
[16:22] I don't know what is going on. How is everyone there? Even Saqlain..
You have an exam in the morning. You can ask about Ramsha tomorrow.
[16:34] But Faraz.
Mahnoor you're giving your exam tomorrow and its decided. Please try and sleep.
[17:01] Aunty, I have my exam today. I've worked very hard.
[17:08] I've waited as well. I'm a little nervous.
[17:14] Please pray for me.
[17:27] May God give you success.
Mom, I'll just drop Mahnoor and come.
[17:33] Dear, breakfast?
I'll come and have it.
[17:36] Why are you taking her hungry? How will she attempt her paper hungry?
[17:40] I'll eat something there.
[17:47] Please take your bag. I'll wait outside.
[18:00] You're worried about your daughter in law and that too after so much arguments?
[18:05] I thought your mood will be spoiled because of her because Faraz slapped Mahir because of Mahnoor.
[18:15] Faraz hit Maheer because of what he did. Had he done this before, things wouldn't have reached this point.
[18:24] Didn't I tell you to control Maheer?
Is it all my fault? How can I control him?
[18:32] I cannot slit his throat. He's my son and that too my dear son.
[18:37] This son of mine has left me embarrassed in front of my daughter in law.
[18:54] Shut the door slowly. Your father isn't alive to get us a new one. He's venting out on the door.
[19:04] He doesn't bother getting something himself but he will break everything. Go,
[19:12] and ask him for food. He just came home and I was worried for him all night.
[19:35] Salma, ask Ramsha to come for breakfast.
Alright.
[19:40] Wait.
[19:46] Areeba let me have my breakfast and then call her. I don't want to see her face.
[19:53] Please Saqlain. Don't be so angry on Ramsha.
[20:01] Why do you sympathize with her all of a sudden? Now you're advocating for her. Tell me what to do next.
[20:08] She will definitely need to go to the university. She'll meet Maheer there and then run away the first chance they get and get married.
[20:16] No. I don't want this. I'm asking you that,
[20:22] please don't be so angry on Ramsha. All of us scolded her yesterday. I was very angry with her.
[20:30] She is my younger sister. And youngsters make mistakes. Elders should forgive them.
[20:40] Alright. Go and call her for breakfast.
Alright.
[20:46] What can we do she is your younger sister? She's like a sister to me but its different that she has always disrespected me.
[21:10] Tea?
I don't need it. I'm done with my breakfast.
[21:57] My mother, everybody.. This woman has turned everybody in her support.
[22:07] Maheer?
What is it?
[22:09] Will you have breakfast?
I don't want breakfast. Get lost from my room right now.
[22:15] Ill mannered man. I've come to ask you for breakfast even after so much happened,
[22:20] and you're showing me attitude.
Don't you understand? I asked you to leave. Leave.
[22:26] Go to hell. Die hungry.
[22:38] I'll get her straight.
[22:55] Ramsha, Saqlain and Areeba are calling you.
Why?
[23:00] For breakfast.
I don't want any breakfast. If you can, get me poison.
[23:06] I'll eat that.
Salma?
[23:09] Yes?
Please go and give Saqlain another cup of tea. The one he has is cold.
[23:14] Alright.
Go.
[23:17] Will you not stop being stubborn? Aren't you ashamed of showing so much attitude even when you're at fault?
[23:24] I am trying to beg Saqlain to not be upset with my sister and your attitude is never ending.
[23:33] How dare I show you attitude? I am myself trapped here.
[23:39] I'm imprisoned in my own house. And you two? You both have taken over my house.
[23:47] You are not ashamed of saying this, are you?
[23:52] We are forced to be here because of you. Do you remember?
[23:56] That night you cried and called us here when your ex lover came in this house.
[24:07] My ex lover?
Who else was it? Who came in the house and didn't rob us of anything?
[24:16] Those guys used to follow you as well. You had them stalking your van.
[24:23] And the letter that came. What about that?
[24:28] You and Mahnoor had created a big mess.
[24:34] Had Saqlain and I not come to live here, I would never know that path you were walking on.
[24:40] You're accusing me without any reason. I..
Enough. You don't have to give any clarifications.
[24:48] Its best that you stay home. Understand?
[24:54] Saqlain and I don't want to live here. If we're here, we're here because of you. We're helpless.
[25:07] I'm not an animal that you have captured in this house.
[25:15] Yes? I'm done with my exam. It was very good. Really.
[25:21] No. I didn't call you to pick me up. I have booked a cab. You work peacefully.
[25:28] Listen, I'm going to meet Areeba. Is there any problem? I'll come.
[25:50] Bye.
[26:09] Mahnoor?
[26:25] Wasey? You?
Hello.
[26:29] Hello. How are you?
[26:32] I'm fine. How are you?
[26:36] I'm fine. 
But I don't think you're fine. I feel you're very stressed and..
[26:42] even depressed.
[26:46] You're absolutely wrong. Its nothing.
My intuition?
[26:52] Can never be wrong about you Mahnoor.
[26:57] I can look at your exams and tell..
I had my first exam for CSS today. You understand the pressure and stress of the exams?
[27:06] I was up all night. Maybe that's why.
Oh good. So finally, you're appearing for your exam.
[27:15] Yes.
Best of luck.
[27:19] Thank you.
[27:22] Mahnoor? How will you go?
I've booked a cab. It'll be here any moment.
[27:30] Cancel the cab. I'll drop you.
[27:36] No you don't have to. I can go. Thank you.
[27:41] Mahnoor. At least give me some time. We met after months.
[27:48] I want to talk to you.
Wasey see..
[27:53] I've changed my decision Mahnoor and I respect your decision. I..
[28:00] Can I not get even 10 20 minutes in spare?
Have you forgotten that we parted way a long time ago?
[28:07] There's no need for all this. You can leave.
[28:28] How much time? I've been waiting. What do you mean there's a traffic jam?
[28:34] Should I book another cab? Alright I'll cancel this ride and book another one.
[28:51] What happened?
I think there's a traffic jam thats why the cab is late.
[28:57] But its my fault. I should have brought my car. I'll not even find a rikshaw here.
[29:02] But I'll manage.
I'll drop you.
[29:07] No. There's no need. I can manage.
[29:11] Please Mahnoor. How long will you wait for a taxi here? If there is a traffic jam,
[29:18] the other driver will be late as well. Come with me. I'll drop you.
[29:23] Wasey no.
I have a meeting but I cannot leave you alone here.
[29:30] No but..
Please. Let me give you a ride. Come on.
[29:38] Come. Please. Thank you.
[30:10] How is Hashir?
[30:13] Hashir? 
Your husband's name is Hashir, right?
[30:19] I remember even today. I sent you an email last time.
[30:27] But you didn't it was important to answer that.
Yes because you said I should contact you if I was in need.
[30:35] This means you never needed me. Oh well. Let it be.
[30:41] Tell me, how is Hashir? What does he do? How are you?
[30:47] Are you doing something or are you a housewife?
My husband's name is Faraz.
[30:53] Hashir divorced me two days before we got married. I'm working as a commercial manager in a construction company.
[31:04] Faraz is my colleague.
[31:10] But enough about me? Tell me when did you come back from the US and are you married?
[31:16] I came back this month after completing my studies. I haven't gotten married yet.
[31:22] Why?
Because I had been waiting for you.
[31:37] My house.
Oh I'm sorry. I forgot.
[31:49] Thank you. Bye.
Mahnoor..
[31:54] Yes?
Will you meet again?
[31:58] No.
[32:06] Who is it who dropped Mahnoor?
[32:16] Oh. Its Wasey.
[32:19] How did he come here? Mahnoor with Wasey?
[32:37] How is Ramsha?
How will she be?
[32:42] Ask us, how we are?
Enough, Areeba.
[32:47] Stop being hyper about everything.
[32:52] You have stopped Ramsha at home. Aunty scolded Maheer a lot. Forget everything now.
[33:04] Yes you can say that.
[33:13] The reason is that because nothing bothers you about this.
[33:23] Saqlain I accept that Ramsha made a mistake. You should have stayed in a limit with Maheer in the university.
[33:35] How could she stay in limit? You encouraged her.
I've never encouraged her. I always make her understand.
[33:43] And now you're blaming me..
Alright then.
[33:48] If you couldn't control her, you could have told me. I have now controlled everything doing something or the other.
[33:57] I think rather than saying all this, we should find a good proposal for Ramsha.
[34:10] We should get her married. She is young and insensible. She can make mistakes but we're elder than her.
[34:17] We have to think about her.
[34:25] Yes.
[34:27] Right now, this is the only situation.
I do have a proposal but..
[34:39] No..
[34:42] He is a little older than her.
No. We will not get Ramsha married just for the sake of it.
[34:48] We will look for a good proposal. The guy should be well mannered and well educated.
[34:56] Yes. We should find a good proposal.
[35:00] Yes of course. Why not? He should be splendid.
[35:10] Better than Faraz and Maheer.
[35:22] Educated, well off, well settled.
[35:26] He should be well mannered. He should be a successful man.
[35:35] You had a friend, what was his name? Wasey...
[35:53] We should find such a guy for Ramsha. Isn't it?
[35:58] How come you thought of Wasey right now?
[36:11] I just thought about him.
[36:14] He belonged to a well off family.
[36:21] What was the use of being so well off when you couldn't be loyal?
[36:28] Didn't you see, how before getting married.. Mahnoor..
Yes I remember.
[36:40] There was just something amiss.
[36:43] Right, Mahnoor?
[37:30] Leave from here. I don't want to talk to you.
[37:33] Rather than being ashamed you're being angry with me?
[37:39] What did I do wrong?
How much did I try to make you understand but you didn't listen to me?
[37:45] I love Maheer.
For God's sake. Stop it. He isn't worth you. How will you understand that?
[37:52] Faraz is suitable for you but Maheer isn't worthy of me. What is it? What do you want? Why are you doing this to me?
[38:01] You know your problem? You're idealizing Faraz and looking at Maheer but they're different. Maheer isn't like Faraz.
[38:11] No. I am idealizing Maheer. He is my ideal.
Even then Maheer and Faraz have no comparison.
[38:23] There is still time. Understand. Nothing will go wrong for Maheer but you'll create more problems for yourself.
[38:30] Haven't you left your education and aren't you sitting at home?
[38:33] Had you listened to me, this wouldn't have happened. For God's sake Ramsha. Listen to me and don't do all this.
[38:41] What do you want me to understand? I'm imprisoned here and my university is off limits.
[38:48] What should I do? Die?
Don't say like this.
[38:51] Both of you are my enemies. Ever since mom died you're treating me so wrong.
Who is treating you wrong? Tell me.
[39:02] Areeba, let it be.
What should I let be? Tell me.
[39:07] She's being melodramatic and ill mannered. Had mom been alive she would have given you a good beating.
[39:13] You have no shame left. Your elder brother in law is outside and hearing everything you say.
[39:20] I'm so unlucky. I have to be guilty like a criminal in front of my husband.
[39:26] Did I have less problems in my life that it was important for you to do all this?
[39:32] Please relax. Don't cry like this.
[39:38] You know my pain, don't you.
I do..
[39:43] I keep burning in this fire. I pine whenever I look at my empty lap.
[39:50] And now her dramas..
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[39:55] Control her.
