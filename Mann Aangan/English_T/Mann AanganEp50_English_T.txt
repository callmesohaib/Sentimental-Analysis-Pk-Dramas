[01:32] What is this behavior? Why were you beating on the door? Are you in your senses?
[01:38] Mahnoor...
[01:40] Tell her, we have finalized her wedding.
[01:47] If you try and create a scene, then there will be none worse than me
[01:54] You've already blown our honor to shreds. If you dare try something...
[02:01] Mahnoor, make her understand.
I'll make her understand.
[02:10] For God's sake Ramsha. You didn't listen to me. If you had listened to me and not made that wrong decision...
[02:21] Do you think Tawqir is suitable for me?
[02:28] Have you seen his age? He's so much older than me, why are you doing this to me?
[02:34] I admit he's older than you. But sister Areeba...
[02:39] forget about brother Saqlain. Sister Areeba thinks that he's good for you and she
[02:46] She cannot take a bad decision for you. She thinks that she's a good person
[02:52] He's not good. You are always to read people, then why can't you see this?
[02:59] I know very well that you're just taking revenge on me, right?
[03:12] I don't know why you guys have become so stubborn over this.
[03:17] Otherwise, Mahir wasn't that bad. But you didn't let us get married, that's why we're alone today.
[03:25] And that poor man...
[03:31] Alright...
[03:33] If you want me to marry Tawqir, then I will. But I swear to God that I will not see both of your faces ever again.
[03:41] Never! There is no need for you two to come in front of me ever again!
[04:20] Faraz...
[04:26] My dear, I want to talk to you.
[04:28] Yes mother, what is it? Is everything alright?
I don't know.
[04:34] It seems that nothing is alright.
[04:41] Yasir's mother visited us yesterday.
Alright, so?
[04:47] She talked to me.
About what?
[04:52] Mahir...
No, she doesn't know about that. That would have been embarrassing.
[05:02] Then what did she talk about?
[05:06] Yasir has sent in a request to get hired at your office.
[05:13] So?
[05:15] He was telling me that there is no seat available at the moment.
[05:20] Maybe he'll find a job when a seat is available. But what about his job? I thought he said he had a good job, and he doesn't need to go abroad as well.
[05:30] Then why does he need to change his job?
I don't know. He said that there was a problem.
[05:38] Yasir is a strange man and people like him always have problems.
[05:46] My dear, he said that if Mahnoor talks to her boss...
[05:53] Mother, Mahnoor...
[05:58] When did you come back? I thought you went to check in on a proposal for Ramsha.
[06:02] What happened to that?
Ramsha's marriage has been finalized, she'll get married tomorrow.
[06:09] You and auntie...
[06:18] I'll come with you, when is the wedding ceremony?
[06:23] In the evening.
[06:52] My heart is content with him. The first time I met him, he talked to me very respectfully.
[06:58] And today he was so humble. How can such...
[07:03] a rich man be so humble. There are very few people like him nowadays.
[07:16] You two are responsible for this. I'm an old friend of brother Tawqir...
[07:22] Later on, Ramsha will have to maintain my respect.
[07:31] Mahnoor, tell him that we have finalized her wedding.
[08:24] What insanity is this? Have you gone insane?
[08:27] Don't I have enough problems to deal with? Why are you trying to add more to my problems?
[08:34] What should I do about you? Areeba!
Brother Saqlain let go of my hand...
[08:41] Areeba....
Let go of my hand.
[08:43] Areeba, where are you?
[08:45] Come here...
Let go of me.
[08:48] What happened?
[08:49] What happened? Why do you have this knife in your hand?
So that I can slice my throat with it.
[08:55] So that I may be rid of you people.
What kind of things are you saying?
[08:59] Ask your sister that, she has something new planned.
[09:02] She was about to commit suicide, using this knife.
[09:07] What? She won't die, but she is trying her best to kill us.
[09:11] If she had been successful, the police would have taken me away.
[09:15] Her lover is locked away because of her, and now she wants me locked up as well. Haven't we faced enough shame because of her running away?
[09:23] Have you gone insane? What is the meaning of this?
[09:27] Will you not let us live in peace?
[09:31] She's getting married to Tawqir tomorrow, what face will I have left in front of him?
[09:35] I'll call him right now and tell him that we can't go through with this marriage.
Wait...
[09:40] This marriage is settled. And it is also settled...
[09:46] that he will marry brother Tawqir.
[09:51] Sister, why are you doing this to me? I'm your sister.
That's what's disappointing, that you're my sister.
[10:03] First, it was Mahnoor and now it's you.
[10:07] I feel ashamed calling you two my sister. I've been trying to be your sister all this time, but you...
[10:16] Do you want to ruin your life?
[10:21] I was going to die. Why did you stop me? You all would have been rid of me.
Why are you wasting your time on her?
[10:30] Does she care about anyone? She wants all of us in jail. First, it was her lover and now it will be us. Give that to me.
[10:36] Hold this... kill yourself, so that we may be rid of you.
[10:40] Slit your wrists, what are you looking at?
[10:46] Like you can commit suicide. One needs to courage to commit suicide.
[11:13] Your sisters haven't changed a bit.
[12:02] But I have a condition...
Condition?
[12:14] I will marry the man you want me to marry, but you'll have to listen to me.
[12:21] Otherwise, I will not sign the wedding papers at the vital moment, no matter how embarrassed you guys feel. Hang me if you want.
[12:33] Are you blackmailing us?
Yes.
[12:41] It's not like you guys are treating me any better. You guys falsely alleged Mahir...
[12:52] We alleged Mahir?
[12:54] You'll have to stop your case on Mahir.
[13:04] It will end after your marriage.
No.
[13:09] It will happen before the wedding ceremony.
[13:14] And brother Faraz will confirm with me when that happens. Only then I will sign the wedding papers, otherwise, I will not.
[13:28] Alright.
[13:31] It will be done.
[13:35] But if you betray me, then nothing good will happen.
[13:43] Do I have any other option than listening to you?
[14:52] My husband's name is Faraz. Aashir divorced me two days before my wedding.
[14:59] And... I was working as a commercial manager for a construction company. Faraz is my colleague.
[16:35] If you wanted you could have contacted me after you got divorced from Aashir, but you chose a different path.
[16:42] That is because you thought of me as someone who wronged you. I wanted to give you happiness and unfortunately, I became the cause of your pain.
[16:51] I wish I could meet you one more time and apologize to you. But...
[18:06] He's not a good man. You're always good at reading people, then why don't you see this?
[18:14] I know very well that you're taking revenge on me.
[19:04] What is the matter?
[19:09] You look worried to me.
[19:14] You look worried as well.
[19:20] Our problems are different at this time.
[19:27] I'm worried because of Mahir, my mother and...
[19:32] And?
[19:37] Why are you worried?
[19:42] Nothing is hidden from you.
[19:46] Yes... that man...
[19:51] His name is Tawqir, right?
[19:56] How did you like him?
[20:00] To tell you the truth, I wasn't able to assess him.
[20:08] I was surrounded so much by my worries that I...
[20:13] wasn't able to understand anything. Sister Areeba, Ramsha... Mahir... exams...
[20:21] So many pressures have closed off my mind.
[20:28] As far as first impressions go he looked okay to me. He was decent, well educated...
[20:32] No doubt, he's rich as well.
[20:39] But... still...
[20:42] I don't know. If only you were with me.
[20:48] I'll meet him tomorrow.
There's no point in meeting him tomorrow.
[20:55] Ramsha is getting married tomorrow.
[21:04] Do you think Ramsha will agree?
[21:10] What if Ramsha refuses?
[21:14] I've never seen Ramsha so stubborn.
[21:19] I don't know... Mahir had entrapped Ramsha.
[21:31] I admit that my brother was wrong in doing what he did to Ramsha. In fact, he did wrong to all of us.
[21:43] The foremost thing that love offers is respect. 
[21:49] Love cannot become the cause of degrading someone.
[21:56] If Mahir loved Ramsha, the first thing he would have done was to protect her honor.
[22:09] He would have had Ramsha's respect in our home.
[22:14] He would have had Ramsha respected in her family. He would have proved himself worthy of Ramsha.
[22:22] Not everyone is like you Faraz. Everyone proclaims to be in love...
[22:29] But it's not easy to prove one's love.
[22:36] You've proved your love every day.
[22:41] Sometimes when I think about it, I become entangled with it.
[22:45] Why?
[22:49] Because I don't understand if I respect you more...
[22:55] or love you more.
[24:07] Areeba... hurry up, I want to show you something.
[24:28] What is all this?
[24:31] It's your sister's wedding, I brought it all for her.
[24:34] Yes, I can see that.
[24:37] Did you want you to send her away in ordinary clothes? Don't you want to keep appearances in front of the world?
[24:48] The circumstances that the wedding is happening in, I don't understand...
[24:52] what should happen and shouldn't.
[24:55] I did try to do everything on time. I was swift in buying all this. Take a look at it and tell me if you don't like something.
[25:02] Your choice is fantastic, I can't dislike anything.
[25:08] That is true, but this choice isn't mine.
[25:13] Really... then whose choice is this?
Brother Tawqir.
[25:18] Really?
He spends millions in just a short amount of time.
[25:24] Let me see...
[25:28] My God... this is so beautiful and precious.
[25:33] It's brother Tawqir's wedding and he doesn't want anything to be lacking.
[25:40] That is true.
Ask Mahnoor to reach here on time with his no-good husband.
[25:46] Saqlain...
What?
[25:50] You can see the difference yourself when brother Tawqir and Faraz stand shoulder to shoulder.
[25:58] Should I show these things to Ramsha, it will make her happy.
Sure. Indeed she will be happy.
[26:11] Careful...
[26:19] I still have to have her lover freed.
[26:23] I've got to hand it to them... both sisters have fallen in love with a strong devotion.
[26:27] But why did his lover come back?
[26:32] What is the reason? Anyways...
[26:36] First, let me rid myself of her and then I'll focus on him.
[26:53] What is it?
[26:56] Faraz and I will be there at the wedding.
[27:00] Sister Areeba, Ramsha has listened to you...
[27:05] Ask brother Saqlain...
[27:11] Okay...
[27:19] Ramsha has put forth a condition.
[27:22] She will not marry until...
[27:26] brother Saqlain has Mahir freed.
[28:55] Come on... hero! You've achieved bail!
[29:00] What do you mean?
You're in luck, your relatives have taken their case back.
[29:09] And your brother's pleading has worked. He's an honorable man and his time spent pleading worked.
[29:21] Come on and don't think too much.
Hello, how are you, sister Shaila?
[29:27] I'm fine. How are you?
I'm well, but you don't sound well to me.
[29:37] I'm just feeling a little under the weather.
Take care of yourself.
[29:43] Maybe it's the changing weather.
That is true. Did you talk to your daughter-in-law, Mahnoor?
[29:53] I asked you to talk to Mahnoor about Yasir's job.
[29:58] It seems that you've forgotten your son-in-law.
No, I've not forgotten.
[30:04] I'm not well, that's why I was unable to talk to her. I also mentioned that Mahnoor is having her exams.
[30:10] I'll talk to her in a couple of days and let you know.
Be sure that it's good news that you tell us!
[30:18] Yasir's bright future is connected to your daughter's. You have a son and can understand that.
[30:25] After marriage, men become attached to their wives. If they are settled, ultimately it only benefits their wives.
[30:33] Yes, I'll talk to Mahnoor soon and call you.
[30:39] Farewell.
[30:51] Mahir! Thank God you're back. Do you know how worried mother was... quickly get inside.
[31:08] My dear child is here. Mahir...
Wait a minute...
[31:17] My dear child is here. Look, Faraz, my son is back home.
[31:24] Thank God! Thank God, my child is here.
[31:30] After thanking God, thank Ramsha...
Don't say that wretched girl's name, because of her...
[31:36] Because of her, he was bailed out.
[31:39] Do you know how hard I tried to get him out? Saqlain was out to completely entrap him.
[31:44] I was sure that he wouldn't have let him out after Ramsha's wedding.
[31:54] Why are you giving her credit? She falsely accused me of stealing her jewelry.
[32:05] Saqlain was the one who did that.
[32:15] Ramsha set the condition that she wouldn't marry until the case on you is taken back.
[32:25] What?
[32:32] Today is her wedding and we're going there.
[32:39] It's your responsibility that he doesn't step a foot outside home.
[32:52] Everyone had to bear so much pain because of her. Most of all Ramsha.
[32:58] The one whom he provoked to run away. I want Ramsha's wedding to be concluded without any trouble.
[33:10] And if that doesn't happen, then I will punish him and you can't stop me.
[33:14] No, my dear. He will not do anything like that. I'm here and I'll take care of it.
[33:23] Rather, I'll keep him locked up in his room. He will not get out.
[33:29] Look at yourself. Your face is swollen and you've gotten so weak.
[33:34] Aima... bring something for him to eat. I'll come with you to your room...
[33:43] Mother, I'm fine.
[33:46] Please... I want to be...
[33:50] alone for some time.
[34:24] I don't know... something strange is going on.
[34:28] I don't think they are interested. Why not? You didn't talk to her properly.
[34:35] I did pressurize her in front of you.
[34:43] Do one thing... call Aima... threaten her with breaking off the engagement.
[34:50] When she cries in front of her mother and brother, everything will sort itself out. Then she will listen to you.
[34:58] That will do nothing. Aima isn't interested in me, or what I say.
[35:04] Talk to her affectionately. You're always so annoyed with her. She'll listen to you if you talk to her affectionately.
[35:15] I'll think about it.
[35:35] Saqlain was the one who falsely alleged you, not Ramsha. She said that she wouldn't marry anyone until you're freed. She's getting married today.
[36:10] Mahir... drink this milk.
[36:17] Where are you going?
[36:21] I was going outside.
You cannot go anywhere!
[36:24] I had to see this day because I kept listening to you.
[36:29] Thank God that you're back home and Aima's in-laws didn't get a whiff of this.
[36:36] Otherwise, it would have been hard for me to answer.
[36:42] Sit down.
[36:59] Drink this milk.
[37:28] You look so beautiful.
[37:37] She's getting married now, stop being upset with her.
Stop being her lawyer.
[37:44] When she gets married I'll offer a prayer of gratitude and then I'll return home with a peace of mind.
[37:58] What is the matter? Where are you guys planning to go?
[38:04] Nowhere... I was just saying that we'll return home after Ramsha gets married.
[38:10] Yes, we'll see to that. Until then why are you guys wasting time here? Guests are arriving, go out and tend to them.
[38:17] Come on...
Did you have Mahir freed?
[38:35] Yes, I have.
[38:37] Ask Mahnoor.
[38:42] Yes...
I don't trust you.
[38:46] Brother Faraz... tell me...
[38:50] has Mahir come back home?
Yes, he has.
[39:00] Are you satisfied?
[39:05] That's good.
[39:23] This is for you, from me and Faraz.
[39:29] I don't want a gift. Keep it with you.
[39:36] I bought this for you Ramsha. You're my sister.
[39:43] If you think of me as your sister, you wouldn't have let them do this to me. You would have stopped them.
[39:51] If it were Aima in my place and she was about to get married to a man like him, then would you let it happen?
[40:05] Why are you standing here? The final guests will be here soon.
[40:09] Come on... Mahnoor... Faraz, come on...
