[01:19] Hello... Ramsha?
Brother Faraz...
[01:23] What is the matter? Why are you crying?
Mother has fallen unconscious and she's not waking up.
[01:29] What?
I tried calling sister Mahnoor and brother Saqlain...
[01:34] but I couldn't reach either of them. Please help me.
[01:38] Yes... Mahnoor is in a meeting right now. Try waking up your mother somehow.
[01:44] I'm leaving right now.
Alright, farewell.
[01:50] Basit please pack my stuff and meet me in the parking.
[01:55] Listen... I'm leaving because of something. Ask miss Mahnoor to call me as soon as her meeting ends.
[02:03] Sure, alright.
Be sure to give my message to her.
[02:07] Don't worry.
[02:12] How is she now doctor?
She has woken up, but we need to keep her under observation.
[02:19] Why did this happen?
[02:21] She fell unconscious because oxygen wasn't reaching her brain. Has this happened to her before?
[02:27] No... this has never happened before.
[02:33] This is the first time that this has happened.
[02:39] She's been having trouble breathing these past few days.
I've written some tests. Let's see what they tell us.
[02:45] What kind of tests are they?
They are routine tests, related to this condition.
[02:50] You can go to accounts, there you'll find the rest of the details.
Yes, thank you.
[02:59] Call Mahnoor.
[03:02] I'll go and pay for it
Sure.
[03:57] Faraz... what happened to mother?
[04:01] What happened to her? Why aren't you telling me?
She fell unconscious.
[04:09] You were in a meeting, Ramsha called me here.
How's she feeling? Is she fine?
[04:12] She's fine, she has regained consciousness.
[04:14] I want to meet mother right now. Where is she?
You can't right now, they've taken her for some tests.
[04:22] Please don't worry, God will make everything better. Ramsha don't worry so much, you're worrying Mahnoor as well.
[04:36] How's mother?
She's fine now.
[04:41] But Ramsha was saying...
[04:43] You told everyone, but me. Couldn't you have informed me?
You're the first one that I called.
[04:49] You didn't pick up my calls, thank God that brother Faraz picked up and he brought mother here.
[04:56] Thank you Faraz. If you weren't here, Lord knows what must have happened.
[05:01] It's nothing like that. If I weren't here, God must have made someone else a vessel.
[05:07] Right now, all of you should pray that auntie's tests go well.
[05:12] I'll go and talk to the doctor.
[05:19] You know she is a cholesterol patient and that's why she has trouble breathing. There is a blockage in the blood vessels.
[05:27] We have to see the intensity of the blockage. We need to see if we can clear with medicine, or we need to do a bypass.
[05:33] When will the reports be back?
They will come tomorrow and we will check it in the system as well.
[05:39] Can you see any situation where we might need to admit her?
[05:42] If there isn't any emergency you can take her home. I've stopped one of her medicine, because it wasn't suiting her.
[05:48] As per Dr. Idree's instructions, I discontinued that medicine.
[05:52] Good... according to new reports, that medicine causes a blockage and we cannot give that medicine to patients who have cholesterol.
[06:00] Sure, thank you.
[06:03] I have a friend who works here. I talked to him, but he's not on duty right now.
[06:10] But he said that he'll talk to doctors.
[06:21] Brother Saqlain...
[06:24] What did the doctors say?
She didn't say anything. But she's out of danger.
[06:29] The rest she'll discuss when the reports come back. Maybe she'll be discharged shortly.
[06:33] Let's stay here for now.
How can we go right now?
[06:37] Let me meet my mother and see if she's feeling well or not.
Mahnoor, there's no need to create a rush in the hospital
[06:45] You guys can go home, I'll have her discharged and bring her home. You can meet her there.
[06:54] At least let mother's reports come back.
They will be back tomorrow, shall we stay here until tomorrow?
[07:00] But the doctors said that they would be back in a couple of hours.
[07:10] The reports will be back tomorrow. The rest is up to you. If all of you want to stay here, then please do.
[07:19] I think I should leave. Since everyone is here, I am no needed here.
[07:24] He's right. Take Ramsha home.
[07:28] Saqlain and I will stay with mother.
[07:31] We'll come back home with her.
[07:36] Shall we?
Let's go.
[08:01] It's very late, isn't it?
[08:06] Neither Mahnoor, or Faraz has come back from work. Don't the offices close by now?
[08:12] Mother, they must be busy. They went to work after a long time, I'm sure that there must be a lot of work load.
[08:18] It is possible that they went out somewhere.
If it were like that brother Faraz would have told you.
[08:26] Yes, Mahnoor told me that she'll make dinner and that I shouldn't do anything.
[08:32] Like she would do any sort of work in the house.
[08:36] She has no set time of coming back.
Mother if she said that out of respect, then you could have lovingly refused.
[08:44] She comes home tired from work, should she come back home and work?
Then she should leave her job and stay at home.
[08:51] It's the woman's job to take care of home. Women who work..
[08:56] cannot take care of their homes.
Should she compromise her career to do some household chores?
[09:02] You've been talking a lot lately.
No mother, I was just trying to make you understand.
[09:08] Have you grown so much that you can make me understand?
I was just saying...
[09:12] Don't say anything... go to the kitchen, take you sister-in-law's place. Knead the dough and do the dishes.
[09:29] Lord knows where the two of them. Couldn't they have called and eased my worry?
[09:42] Faraz my dear... why aren't you two home yet?
[09:47] Where are you?
There was an emergency.
[09:52] May God have mercy... are you alright my son?
Yes I am..
[09:58] Actually... Mahnoor's mother got severely unwell
[10:04] She fell unconscious.
[10:06] May God have mercy, how is she feeling now?
[10:11] She's better now... she's been discharged and on her way home.
[10:15] My dear, when will you two be back home?
[10:18] It will take some time, you should go ahead and eat.
[10:22] Don't wait for us.
[10:26] God willing, I'll talk to you when I come back.
Take care of yourself my dear.
[10:34] Something new has started now.
[10:38] They've gotten a servant for free.
[10:47] Mother, are you alright?
Yes, I am.
[10:53] I worried you all today.
All we're worried about is your health.
[11:00] Brother Saqlain, what did the doctors tell you?
[11:04] Did they find anything in the reports?
They checked the reports and there is nothing to worry about.
[11:15] But the doctor's opinion is different. The doctor said that the reason that the reason she fell unconscious is because oxygen wasn't reaching her brain.
[11:29] Her arteries are blocked, as you're already aware of. The doctors checked everything and added new medicine.
[11:35] They've also asked to continue the medicine she was taking. As far as what you guys need to be cautious about, Areeba will tell you about that.
[11:55] There was a person in our neighborhood who only lived for two years after their bypass.
[12:22] Greetings mother.
[12:26] You're still sitting here... why haven't you slept?
[12:29] Greetings to you too... how's sister Sarah feeling now?
[12:38] She's better and now she's home.
[12:42] Thank God... was it something very bad?
[12:45] It doesn't seem like it, but I think she's in pain.
[12:53] Did you eat anything? Where's Mahnoor? Did she not come with you?
[12:59] I'm not hungry and I don't feel like it.
[13:03] Mahnoor has stayed with her mother today. She was very worried.
[13:11] There should be a limit to one's irresponsibility. Her husband has tired himself tending to her mother all day...
[13:18] and she didn't even feed you.
Mother, she was very worried.
[13:23] She hasn't eaten anything since morning, there was a lot of work to do at the office. We had a lunch today at work as well..
[13:31] but we had to come to the hospital.
Still, she should have been worried about you.
[13:36] One has to take care of their in-laws home, not just their own.
[13:41] She stayed of her own accord, she didn't even ask me.
[13:46] Mother, I told you that she was very worried because of her mother.
[13:51] Enough... don't defend your wife too much. I don't want to say anything that might hurt you.
[14:04] I won't defend her, alright?
[14:09] Now please improve your mood.
[14:16] Mother...
[14:19] Do you have money?
[14:23] Yes, I do. You just gave it to me for the expenses.
[14:28] Not that... what happened about your committee money, did you get it?
[14:35] Yes, I got it this morning.
[14:38] Could you loan me some money from it?
[14:43] Why do you need money so out of the blue?
[14:49] I took a loan from a friend and I need to return it. I'll return it to you in a week.
[15:02] I'm very tired, I'm going to rest. You should rest as well.
[16:14] Has mother fallen asleep?
[16:17] Yes, she has. You should sleep as well.
[16:23] I can't sleep. As soon as I close my eyes...
Don't think like that.
[16:28] Nothing will happen to her, right?
Mother is fine right now.
[16:33] I think I should take mother's reports to a different doctor. We should take a second opinion.
[16:40] Faraz was telling me that he had a friend. We can use his reference to show it to another doctor.
[16:46] Brother Faraz came here like an angel. He called the ambulance and took here away immediately.
[16:54] The ambulance came here even though he hadn't reached here.
[16:58] I'm so stupid...
[17:03] that it didn't occur to me that I could have called the ambulance as well.
It's alright.
[17:08] Shall I say something to you? I told you once that I don't you and brother Faraz as a couple.
[17:19] I was completely wrong. A loyal and sincere man like brother Faraz suits you.
[17:27] The way he helped me today, made me forget your absence.
[17:39] It's very late, go to sleep.
[17:45] Lay down.
[18:13] Hello...
Were you sleeping?
[18:17] No... why are you still up? Is everything alright?
Mother is fine.
[18:25] Did you eat anything?
Yes, and you?
[18:30] I did... was auntie saying something?
No.
[18:36] She was worried, she was asking about your mother.
[18:41] Something very bad was avoided because of you today. Lord knows what might have happened if you weren't there.
[18:47] Ramsha is so naive that...
[18:51] she didn't know what she needed to do.
Worrying what might have happened if I weren't there...
[18:57] What would have happened if I weren't in your life?
[19:04] In the beginning I didn't feel any special change...
[19:08] but now I feel your importance.
[19:14] You have all the good habits that a life companion should have.
[19:20] That is something that Ramsha told me today.
[19:24] It makes me happy to hear that. I also wonder what must have happened if you weren't in my life.
[19:45] These are papers for your nine objections and think that we've found a buyer as well.
[19:51] They are willing to offer that price.
[19:55] Good...
What I don't understand is, why are you selling these two shops?
[20:02] You get good rent from it and rates of property are rising as well.
[20:07] I think if you keep it for some years... you can make tens of millions by selling it.
[20:13] And in a few years it's price will go sky high.
[20:19] But till then the currency will devalue as well. Besides I need the money right now.
[20:25] Are you leaving the country?
[20:30] Why would I leave the country? What will I do leaving the country?
[20:34] Do one thing, announce the sale of auntie's house as well.
[20:38] What? Do you intend on selling that as well?
[20:44] What are your intentions?
[20:48] What do you think?
It seems dangerous to me.
[20:52] I have something to take care of, until then you can it here and take guesses.
[21:04] He's become a leech that will make them homeless.
[21:08] Anyways, what do I care?
[21:12] It's not like they are my relatives.
[23:08] Is Fariya back?
She's in her room.
[23:15] Let's start the wedding ceremony.
I need to talk to you first.
[23:20] What do you need to talk about now?
[23:21] I want to talk about the marriage ceremony. I want to discuss some matters with you.
[23:30] Alright, let's talk then.
[23:39] Yes... what do you want to discuss right now?
[23:45] Saqlain, you might be marrying Fariya, but you didn't tell me the amount of the dower.
[23:54] How much do you want?
[23:58] You know Fariya turned away millions for you. If she had married her uncle's son, she would have been an owner to a bungalow.
[24:15] You want me to give millions as a dower?
[24:19] No millions... but it should be at least fifty lacs.
[24:25] And transfer this house to Fariya.
Are you insane?
[24:34] For the past few years you two have been living here and can continue doing so. What difference does it make if this house is in my name or Fariya's?
[24:42] It does make a difference. You haven't divorced Areeba and you are marrying Fariya in secret.
[24:50] In front of the world Areeba is your wife and she has a right over everything you own.
[25:01] Listen, don't take anything I say the wrong way..
[25:07] It's not like that I don't trust you. I just want security for my daughter.
[25:16] Alright.
[25:19] You and Fariya will get fifty lacs as security...
[25:24] And this house as well...
[25:27] Anything else?
[25:30] I'll check in on Fariya.
[27:26] What happened? Show it to me!
[27:31] This is very deep... I need to bandage it... get up!
[27:39] Keep an eye on the stove.
[28:44] Greetings auntie.
Greetings to you too. How's your mother feeling now?
[28:51] Thank God it's better than before.
Thank God. May God give her health.
[28:58] Amen.
If something like that happens you should notify your home as well.
[29:05] Faraz called you, otherwise I...
Otherwise you wouldn't have looked back.
[29:13] Do you only have a relationship with Faraz? Do you have no association with me or this home?
[29:20] It's not like that... mother was so unwell that I forgot everything.
[29:26] My dear, you should have been mindful.
[29:31] There are bigger tests that will come in life... one should be brave and strong.
[29:38] Look at Faraz, he tended to your mother all day. He didn't eat anything as well... he fell asleep on an empty stomach.
[29:49] Even though I offered him food.
[29:55] Don't worry about us, but you should take care of your husband. He's your responsibility.
[30:04] His right is greater than your mother and sister.
[30:09] Auntie, I talked to him at night, he said that he had eaten.
Instead of asking, you should have fed him before sending him away.
[30:21] He won't say anything. You know how he is... he doesn't say a work, no matter how much pain he is in.
[30:33] Yes... I will take care of this in the future. You will not get a chance to complain in the future.
[30:41] Bless you my dear. I talk to you because you understand what I say. Please don't take anything I say in the wrong way.
[30:49] Sure.
[30:53] Listen... wait...
[30:58] Faraz asked me for some money last night. Please give this to him.
[31:06] He said that he had to return a loan to a friend.
[31:38] Do you have any complaints against me now?
Who said that I have complaints against you?
[31:45] You had, that's why you left me... I have forgotten everything...
[31:53] you should too.
[31:55] You now must have realized that I can do anything for you.
I'm being repaid for my pure love.
[32:04] From now on I have a right over you.
[33:41] All the lights in the house are open.
[33:44] No one closes them. The bill be hefty this month.
[34:10] Mahir..
Yes mother?
[34:16] Why haven't you slept yet?
I can't seem to fall asleep.
[34:22] What's your problem? Why do you stay up like an owl?
[34:28] I was just going to sleep.
[34:34] What's in your hand, what are you hiding?
Nothing... what would I hide from you?
[34:39] Mahir show me... I saw you hiding something.
It's nothing!
[34:43] Show it to me!
[35:00] Cigarette?
[35:04] Since when?
Since a few days ago.
[35:08] Have some shame! Faraz is so many years older than you...
[35:14] till this day he hasn't touched it.
[35:16] Please don't compare me to brother Faraz. I am what I am. Why do you expect me to be like someone else.
[35:23] Lower your voice when you talk to me.
[35:26] I'll slap you if you say one more word. Why would you become like Faraz... you would like to become like you juvenile friend.
[35:39] Mahir... their fathers have money, they can do whatever they want with it.
[35:45] But you don't have a father. You are in indebted to your brother's favors.
[35:52] He taking loans from his friends to make ends meet for him and his wife.
[35:59] And, why did you need the money? To buy cigarettes?
You didn't give it to me, right?
[36:06] Give me my cigarettes!
Back off you ill-mannered man!
[36:11] I will burn these... don't you dare buy cigarettes again!
[36:34] You're still up? Why haven't you slept?
[36:39] I felt like sitting with you.
I was offering some prayers before I go to sleep.
[36:45] Sit down... why are you making yourself restless? Go and rest.
[36:52] I felt anxious in my room, that's why I came here.
[36:58] Maybe it's because I can't sleep in another bed.
Why don't you go home?
[37:06] Why are you making yourself restless for me? I'm fine, don't worry yourself for me.
[37:14] No mother... I'm not restless. I told Mahnoor that I'll stay with you today.
[37:22] Besides... I'm at home alone.
[37:28] Saqlain is in Hyderabad, he'll come back tomorrow.
[37:35] Really? What is the matter? You don't seem well... are you feeling well?
[37:43] Yes...
[37:47] I don't understand what has happened to me...
[37:54] It seems...
[37:59] that something bad is about to happen.
God forbid, what are you saying?
[38:05] Come here to me... come my dear.
[38:10] Don't say such things...
[38:17] Nothing bad will happen.
