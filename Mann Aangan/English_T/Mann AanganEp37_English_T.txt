[01:50] He's your husband, don't make him your employee. You took time off from work and asked him to do your share of the work.
[01:58] What did that poor man get in return? You didn't even let him get promoted.
[02:19] Yes?
Faraz, you're still not home yet.
[02:24] Yes... I was just checking the production cycle.
[02:29] Please come home, I'll come to work tomorrow and check in on everything.
[02:36] What is the matter?
Is everything alright?
Yes, it is.
[02:42] When I came home, you weren't present there.
[02:50] And... I was missing you.
[02:58] You were missing me?
[03:02] Why? Can't I miss you?
[03:10] Do you not miss me in my absence?
[03:15] No... I miss you a lot. I can't seem to concentrate on work without you here.
[03:22] I've gotten used to you.
[03:26] Alright then, come back home immediately. You can take care of the work later. I'm waiting for you.
[03:35] Okay... I'm coming.
Farewell.
[04:45] It's Saqlain.
[04:47] Hello... greetings.
Areeba, come home quickly.
[04:52] Is everything alright...
Nothing is alright, that's why I'm calling you here.
[04:59] I don't feel well at all.
What happened? Are you alright?
[05:03] I'm not fine.
[05:05] I feel immense pain in my chest. Come home quickly.
[05:09] Saqlain, go to a doctor immediately.
How can I go to a doctor?
[05:17] Come home!
I'll leave right now. I'll be right there.
[05:35] Saqlain is not feeling well. I have to go. Don't worry...
[05:39] I'll go and get Salma.
What happened? Why are you leaving me alone?
[05:46] Don't worry. Sister Salma is here with you. Call me if you need anything
I'm alone here.
[06:22] Enough sister, why are you crying?
What else should I do?
[06:29] No one cares for me.
[06:34] Mother has left me and the rest of them have left me as well.
No sister, everyone cares for you.
[06:41] And I'm here with you. Sister Mahnoor was so worried about you that she asked me not to leave you, even for a single minute.
[06:49] That's why she left, right?
Try and understand her compulsion.
[06:54] She can't stay here forever. Look I've ironed your clothes for tomorrow. You'll go to university tomorrow, right?
[07:03] Hmm.
[07:36] How are you feeling now?
It's better than before.
[07:44] I would feel better if you visit a doctor.
There is no need for that. I'll feel better once I eat.
[07:58] Why aren't you eating?
[08:01] I don't feel like eating anything. When you called and told me that you weren't feeling well...
[08:09] I felt strange. Thank God you're alright now.
[08:21] I was thinking of bringing Ramsha here for a few days.
[08:31] What need is there to bring her here?
[08:37] I called her... she was scared and crying.
[08:43] She's alone at home so...
[08:47] Salma is there with her. We hired her twenty-four-seven so that Ramsha isn't alone.
[08:59] Look Areeba, it's not that I don't want to bring Ramsha here.
[09:04] I'm worried for her as well. But this isn't the solution. Even if she stays here for a few days, in the end, she'll have to go back.
[09:18] You're right.
[09:23] She has to get used to living alone.
Alright, don't worry. We'll think about this.
[09:31] We'll find a solution.
[09:38] Shall I serve dinner?
Yes.
[09:51] What is the matter? Are you feeling a lot of pain?
No, it's alright. I've taken a few painkillers, I'll be fine.
[10:01] Eat.
[10:53] What is it? What are you doing?
[10:57] You said that you missed me.
But ever since I came home, you haven't even looked at me.
[11:05] You're keeping yourself busy.
[11:11] The closet is very disorganized.
[11:14] I decided that I was set your clothing.
Yes, it's my fault. I've messed up the closet.
[11:24] How?
[11:28] Why do you take the blame for every mistake I make?
[11:32] It's my fault. When you're at home, everything is in its place.
[11:39] I am the one who messes them up.
[11:44] Shall I ask you something?
Sure...
[11:51] What complaints do you have against me?
[11:56] Complaints? What complaints?
[12:04] Complaints about a home.... complaint about the office...
[12:11] Complaints about our personal life.
[12:19] You've always stood by me.
[12:29] I think...
[12:33] that I'm not reciprocating that.
[12:38] That is a weird thing to say.
[12:44] Now that you've asked me, let me tell you. I have no complaints against you.
[12:55] I think that because of me I've started becoming more confident in myself.
[13:12] I feel that I can say anything to you. That's why if I ever have a complaint, I won't keep it in my heart, I'll tell you.
[13:23] I think that we at least have that much understanding.
[13:34] How's Ramsha?
[13:37] She's fine. She's just a little worried.
[13:41] Because of her, I'm worried. How will she live alone?
[13:48] Let's bring her here.
[13:54] I'll drop you there, you can meet her.
[14:03] Shall we go outside for a while? The weather is pleasant today.
[14:10] That will improve both our moods.
[14:22] Sister Ramsha?
Yes?
[14:25] Get up and have something to eat.
[14:29] I don't want to. You can go ahead.
Sister, you didn't have lunch as well.
[14:34] Sister Mahnoor asked me to feed you.
[14:39] Otherwise, you'll get sick.
I won't die if I don't eat a single day.
[14:45] And even if I die, it's not like anyone would care.
[14:52] Go away, I don't want to eat.
[15:32] Hello... greetings. Is everything alright?
[15:38] Greetings to you too. As per your habit, you were not picking up.
[15:44] No Asif it's not like that. My phone was in the kitchen that's why...
Why don't you keep your phone with you?
[15:50] Who keeps their phone on their person at all times?
You know that I can call you at any hour.
[15:56] Yasir... is it not possible that you to call me at a set time. I mean...
I understand what you mean...
[16:04] Maybe you don't like talking to me.
It's not like that. Don't mind, I was saying it for your convenience.
[16:12] Look... I can call you anytime I feel like it.
[16:21] Tell me, is sister Mahnoor home? Mother and I wanted to pay our condolences on her mother's demise.
[16:29] We decided that we would come by if she was home.
Alright, I'll make mother aware of this.
[16:37] I mean... anything!
[16:42] Faraz, I didn't know that you knew so many jokes.
I memorized them...
[16:48] It was never hard before to make you laugh.
[16:58] Mahnoor, please don't start crying now.
[17:02] You don't know how precious your tears are to me.
[17:07] When you cry... I don't like it at all.
[18:29] Sister Salma!
[18:40] Sister Salma!
[19:36] I'll call sister Mahnoor.
[19:40] Pick up the phone 
[19:49] Sister Areeba.
[20:18] Sister Areeba, there's someone in the house.
What happened Ramsha? Who is it?
[20:27] I don't know, first, he climbed into the house, and now he's at my door.
[20:34] I feel afraid. Please come here.
What I want you to do...
[20:39] is lock your room from the inside.
I...
[20:45] I've locked it.
Ramsha, I'll call Saqlain right now.
[20:49] He's not at home... I'll leave as soon as he comes.
[20:54] What is it, is everything alright?
It's Ramsha, she says that there's someone inside the house.
[20:59] Ramsha, what happened?
Brother Saqlain, I feel afraid...
[21:05] If he comes inside, what will I do? Sister Salma isn't home, I feel afraid, please come home.
[21:11] No one will come inside. Don't open the door. We'll be right there.
[22:00] Don't worry, we're here now. Saqlain will fix everything.
[22:08] He's here.
[22:12] I saw everything downstairs. Everything seems fine here as well.
[22:33] I saw everything. Everything is in its place. Nothing has been stolen.
[22:39] How can anything be stolen, when there was no one inside?
No!
[22:43] Sister, someone was here. I'm telling the truth.
[22:48] Sister Ramsha, I closed all the windows and doors in the evening. How can someone come inside?
[22:54] Yes, there was someone outside. He was knocking on the door, it felt that he would break the door down.
[23:00] No... sister, someone was trying to open my door...
[23:06] It felt as though they would break the door and come inside.
That was me. I came to check in on you.
[23:16] but you closed the door. I was the one who was knocking.
[23:21] Sister Salma, if it was you, then you should have told her that.
[23:26] She was scared for so long and you didn't say anything.
The truth is that I was so afraid that I lost my voice.
[23:35] My God! Go away from here!
[23:45] Sit down here
[23:49] Don't be afraid. Sister take me away from here. I won't stay here alone.
[23:57] I asked Saqlain to let you stay with us.
[24:02] Sure, alright. She can stay with us for a few days, this will stop making her afraid. But what will she do after that?
[24:09] Brother Saqlain, what would I do here alone?
[24:14] You know when mother was present I didn't even go to my room alone. 
[24:21] And you know how afraid I feel to go to the roof in the evening.
[24:25] Areeba, there is another solution for this. We can shift here.
[24:32] But why?
Can't you see how afraid she is? This way she'll die out of fear.
[24:40] No, we'll take here with us.
What would we do about this house then?
[24:46] After knowing that your mother wasn't here anymore, someone tried to get in. What will we do if they manage to get inside next time?
[24:53] Something like that won't happen.
It does, you just haven't seen how the world operates.
[24:59] Us coming here, will empty our house.
Not a problem. We'll rent it out, or find some other solution for it.
[25:08] Once she gets married, we'll shift back to our home.
[25:14] Brother Saqlain is right.
[25:17] Please stay with me. Thank God you picked up my phone...
[25:23] I called sister Mahnoor as well, but she...
You called Mahnoor as well.
[25:30] Yes... I did.
[25:33] But, she didn't pick up.
[25:36] She would have picked up if she cared. She knew that you were alone. The least she can do is pick up the phone.
[25:43] Look at us, we came running here.
[25:48] She was already so worried for you. She didn't even have dinner.
[25:56] Don't worry...
[26:00] We're shifting here. There's no need for you to worry anymore.
[26:04] Alright?
[28:12] I ruined your sleep.
No.
[28:18] I just woke up.
[28:25] Ramsha called me.
[28:40] She hung up.
Maybe she's getting ready for university.
[28:47] You can call her in the afternoon.
[28:51] Yes... alright.
[29:08] Nothing...
Alright.
[29:13] Freshen up, I'll make breakfast.
[29:52] Tea...
[29:59] Sister...
[30:03] Sister... I'll leave for university then.
[30:10] When will you come back?
[30:13] The usual time I come back from university.
Ramsha as far as I remember, you never come back home on time.
[30:20] You were always late.
That's because I had classes that made me late.
[30:26] Whatever the reason may be, from now on you will come back home directly from work.
[30:32] Your sister gets worried.
[30:41] Sure.
[30:52] Hello...
Ramsha how are you? You were calling me? Is everything alright? 
[31:00] That was about last night and that has passed.
[31:08] Actually, my phone was in the room and I didn't know. Are you alright?
I'm fine and I'm alive.
[31:16] There is no need for you to worry about me. Focus on your life.
Ramsha, what are you saying?
[31:31] What happened last night that she called me? May God have mercy.
[31:39] I hope everything's fine.
[31:46] I'll get going, farewell.
Farewell.
[32:05] Areeba, I think you need to keep an eye on Ramsha.
[32:11] Try and understand that she's our responsibility. I don't people pointing fingers at us.
[32:24] Understand?
[33:11] Greetings...
Where were you?
[33:14] I was stuck in traffic.
[33:18] Anyways, good job. Here is your money.
[33:23] Thank you very much, sir. Do I need to go to that house tonight?
No, you don't need to.
[33:29] My work is done, you can go now.
Sure sir, remember me if you have something else.
[33:36] Sure...
[33:49] Ramsha, I wanted to call you because I wasn't able to talk to you then.
[33:55] I wanted to call you and give you hope.
[34:02] Then why didn't you call me?
[34:05] It felt that you didn't want to talk to me.
No...
[34:09] It's not like I didn't want to talk to you. Actually, I didn't know...
[34:17] the situation you were in. Would you be able to talk to her or not...
[34:23] I don't know. No one was with me.
[34:27] No one.
[34:30] In fact, after mother, it seems that I'm alone.
[34:37] I can't even tell you what I faced last night. Both of my sisters went to their homes and left me alone.
[34:46] And there were thieves at our house.
What are you saying? Did anything happen to you?
[34:56] Your sister is so strange. In the beginning, I thought that you two were close.
[35:04] Ramsha... do one thing... talk to your sister and stay with us for a few days.
[35:14] You know that she will never do that.
[35:17] Yes... maybe because of me... it's because she hates me.
[35:27] Ramsha, how will you live alone under these circumstances?
[35:32] God forbid if something happens...
I'm not alone sister Areeba and brother Saqlain are staying with me.
[35:55] Don't think you're alone. I'm always with you. Trust me.
[36:03] If you ever need anything, I'm right here.
[36:27] What happened now? Why do you look so worried?
[36:31] Your problems are disappearing one after another.
[36:40] There are still a lot of problems.
[36:44] The medicine that I gave auntie, Mahnoor has been sent for a lab test.
[36:54] I don't know how I will handle the situation when the lab results come back.
[37:00] Oh yes, that is problematic.
[37:05] Through the reports, they will learn very easily that you mixed poison with the medicine.
[37:15] Don't worry... I'll serve you tea before it gets cold.
[37:25] What happened, are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
[37:30] What will happen to me? I've gotten used to living without you.
[37:36] Now our child has to get used to it.
Not at all. I won't let our child get out of my sight.
[37:47] Once our child comes into this world, you'll see how much I'll pamper him.
[37:54] Besides...
[37:57] I'm doing all of this for our child.
[38:01] Really? Are you doing all of it for our child? Will you do nothing for me?
[38:07] No... it's nothing like that. What do you want?
[38:14] I asked you to do one thing. I've asked Ramiz about that shop.
[38:20] You didn't give me money for that.
[38:24] I forgot about all these troubles.
[38:27] I'm sorry.
[38:31] I'll write you a check right now. You can give it to him tomorrow.
[38:44] Here you go.
[38:47] Happy?
[38:51] Yes...
[38:55] The tea will get cold, let me get it for you.
[39:00] Let me do it.
[39:25] Excuse me.
[39:29] Hello...
Mahnoor, this is Dr. Sana speaking.
[39:34] How are you?
I'm fine.
[39:36] I can understand that your mother's sudden death was very shocking for you.
[39:42] Do you remember that I asked you to have your mother's medicine lab tested?
[39:47] Yes, I sent it to the lab the very same day.
[39:52] Did you check the report? I've taken a look at it and you can see it online as well.
[39:59] Can you come to the hospital for a while?
Is everything alright?
[40:09] Come here, then we'll talk.
Sure... farewell.
[40:16] What's the matter? Why did the doctor call you?
She wants to talk about medicine. In all the trouble I forgot to go there.
[40:28] Alright then, I'll come with you.
[40:31] Will you come with me?
Yeah sure.
