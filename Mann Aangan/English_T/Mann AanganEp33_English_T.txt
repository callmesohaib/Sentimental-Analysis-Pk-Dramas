[01:25] How much longer will you stay upset with me?
[01:30] I didn't accept this foolishness from you. I want to keep a veil over things and you want to tell everyone about everything.
[01:42] Sister Areeba saw you fighting that day with me. The other day mother noticed it as well, and now today brother Saqlain knows it as well.
[01:50] Why can't you understand?
[01:58] Why don't you don't want me and Mahir...
Mahir is not right for you Ramsha.
[02:03] How can it be that brother Faraz is a good man and Mahir isn't?
The difference between Faraz and Mahir is night and day.
[02:12] And his family knows that as well.
[02:20] Look Ramsha, he's not right for you.
What is he lacking, that I can't see?
[02:28] You'll be able to see what he's lacking once you stop acting so foolish.
[02:33] But you don't want to see anything? He lies and steals from his own home, then how can he be faithful to you?
[02:42] He smokes cigarettes daily and he has affairs with so many girls. Still, you say that he lacks nothing.
[02:48] He talks to me.
[02:52] There are others he talks to apart from you. I heard Mahir take their name while he was talking to them.
[03:01] No, all of them are university friends, I know them.
But you will stay away from Mahir and that is my final decision.
[03:08] This is the last warning for you.
[03:15] If you don't listen to me I will tell sister and brother Saqlain everything...
[03:20] and then they'll decide what they need to do with you.
[04:06] I think that Saqlain is just prolonging things.
[04:12] He will never divorce his first wife.
I think that too. I think he's just passing the time.
[04:23] I was worried about it before, but now I want to be rid of him as well.
[04:29] I don't think he'll leave you so easily.
[04:36] I think that you won't get your hands on anything but this house and those fifty lacs.
[04:43] Everything belongs to his first wife.
[04:49] And if Saqlain finds her wife expecting a child, then know that you'll lose everything.
[04:57] I want to be rid of him and you're asking me to give birth to his child?
[05:03] What's wrong with you?
She's going to the doctor daily.
[05:09] If Saqlain finds her expecting a child, then know that you'll have no importance.
[05:17] Yes, you're right.
[05:21] Tell me, what should we do?
[05:25] First, make him get rid of Areeba.
[05:30] Tell Areeba everything. She will leave him then.
[05:36] And what will Saqlain have left, but you? He will come to you.
[05:47] Then you can rob him of his money.
[05:52] And then you can take a divorce and leave him.
[05:59] Yes... that is good advice.
[06:07] Okay, let's do this.
[06:23] Greetings*
[06:30] Where's your wife?
[06:32] She'll be here any minute now.
[06:37] Do you know what your wife has done?
[06:41] What has she done?
She tried ending Aima's relationship.
[06:53] She called Yasir and asked him to delay the marriage. She told him that this was Aima's wish.
[07:07] She's standing right in front of you. Tell your brother what objection you have.
[07:13] Brother...
Let me ask him...
[07:16] How dare she talk to him in secret?
[07:24] I am offering prayers of gratitude here and she's playing such vile games.
[07:32] Greetings.
[07:35] She's here. Will you ask her, or should I?
[07:42] Did you call Yasir?
Yes, I did...
[07:46] You called and asked him to reject the marriage?
[07:50] Not at all... I only asked him to delay the wedding for a while...
But why?
[08:00] What problem did you have...
I did it because of Aima's studies...
[08:06] You are so petty. You got jealous!
[08:10] You were jealous that your sister-in-law was getting married in a good home.
[08:25] Will you keep standing there silently?
[08:30] You won't say a word to your wife, because she can get away with murder.
[08:35] After what she did today, anyone else in your place would have sorted her out.
[08:41] Either you can talk, or you can let me talk. I can only say something if you stop talking.
[08:48] Faraz...
Enough...
[08:56] Listen to me... envious people are never successful.
[09:02] The plan that you made, will fall on your head!
[09:12] You had ill intentions for us.
[09:19] Aima will be married on time.
[09:43] Why were you standing there silently? Why didn't you tell your brother anything?
[09:47] Go and bring me water.
[09:51] All idiots are gathered in the same place.
[10:01] Faraz... believe me...
[10:05] I had no ill intentions when I talked to brother Yasir. I talked to him because Aima wants to further her studies.
[10:15] Before talking to anyone you should have discussed it with me.
[10:24] If Aima had shared something with you...
[10:28] it was your duty to tell me about it. What need was there for you to involve yourself in this matter?
[10:34] I admit that I made a mistake, I should have discussed it with you.
[10:40] I didn't expect this foolishness from you.
[10:47] If they use this as an excuse to break off the relationship, then you'll be the one to blame for this.
[10:55] Sorry.
[11:30] I can't believe it.
[11:34] It feels that your prayers have been answered.
[11:41] The doctor said that I can be treated.
[11:46] Thank God... I told you not to lose hope in God.
[11:56] He never keeps His people in the dark, sooner or later He guides them toward the light.
[12:03] For the first time, a doctor has told me...
[12:07] that I can become a mother. I'm not barren... I can give Saqlain a child.
[12:20] Thank God... you've answered our prayers.
[12:26] Thank God.
[13:22] There is a woman here to meet you.
[13:27] A woman who wants to meet me?
Yes.
[13:30] Dust the room, I'll see who it is.
Sure
[13:45] Yes?
[13:50] Are you Areeba?
Yes, I am.
[13:56] Sorry, I didn't recognize you. Who are you?
I'm Fariya, Saqlain's wife.
[14:19] What?
[14:28] What did you say?
The truth, Saqlain...
[15:05] You... how did you get here? What are you doing in my home?
[15:16] What is she saying?
[15:19] She's saying that...
[15:24] she's your wife.
She's a fraud
[15:30] You're lying Saqlain.
[15:45] I was only holding myself back because you're a woman, otherwise, I would have reported you to the police by now.
[15:54] Areeba, I told you that day about the person that came in front of my car, right?
[15:59] Yes... in the hospital.
She was that person.
[16:06] I helped her as a human being that day, and to avoid a police case as well. I even gave her money.  
[16:11] She took my home and office address from somewhere. And now she's here to blackmail me!
[16:16] Saqlain what are you saying? I'm your wife... why don't you tell her?
It's because of people like you, honest people like us don't help anyone.
[16:29] Get out of here!
[16:35] Before I shove you out of here, get out!
What you're doing is wrong and you will regret it!
[16:52] You're doing wrong by me!
Do you that she's threatening me in front of you?
[16:58] I'm not scared of fraud people like and you will gain nothing saying all of that in front of my wife.
[17:04] And if you say that I'm married to you then where is the marriage certificate?
[17:14] You can forge a marriage certificate nowadays, but do you have any proof?
[17:25] Begone! Begone!
[17:28] Don't ever show me your face again, otherwise, I'll do something you'll never forget.
[17:48] Are you leaving... or shall I shove you out!
[18:04] Tell me something, don't you ask someone who they are before inviting them in?
[18:09] She might have a gang that steals from people. People like her can do anything.
[18:16] Be careful... don't just invite anyone in,
[18:27] I'm sorry... I'm being angry at you. Avoid such a situation, you're at home alone all day.
[18:34] Anything can happen.
[19:58] Sister...
[20:02] I'm so sorry... because of me, you were scolded.
[20:09] Look... I told you that it won't be appropriate if I talk, but you didn't listen to me.
[20:17] Sister, I told mother the truth, I would never want anyone to point fingers at you because of me.
[20:27] But mother lied to brother and put the entire thing on you.
[20:32] I admit my mistake because I did make one.
[20:39] If I had discussed this with Faraz, before involving myself, then maybe this fight might not have happened.
[20:50] And Faraz wouldn't have been upset with me either.
[20:54] Sister, if you want I can tell brother Faraz the truth.
[20:58] No, there's no need for it.
[21:04] It is between us and I'll handle it.
[21:12] You and your brother fought. Mother scolded you as well...
[21:17] and my problem remains unsolved
[21:22] Shall I say something to you?
[21:27] Learn to take a stand for yourself
[21:33] You want to further your studies, and it isn't wrong to ask for your right.
[21:41] That's why I helped you. Because I want you to further your studies.
[21:48] If you had been brave enough to share this with your brother, there wouldn't have been any need for you to involve any third person.
[21:59] And your problem would have been solved as well.
[22:04] You're right.
[22:19] What happened?
I'm so angry that I want to kill Saqlain. He shoved me out of his house!
[22:27] He lay in front of Areeba. He called me a fraud and told her that I was blackmailing her!
[22:33] How dare he! He's attached himself to his first wife like a leech and...
I should have never listened to you, this is all your fault.
[22:45] We gained nothing and we might lose Saqlain as well.
I did it for your well being Fariya.
[22:51] How would I have known that Saqlain would be there?
[22:57] Look how quickly changed his face! We should be cautious of him.
I think that our plan is about to fall on our heads.
[23:07] What if Saqlain leaves me?
If he does, we'll lose everything.
[23:12] We will have nothing left.
[23:17] Our hard work will be ruined!
[23:59] What are you thinking?
[24:03] You hit someone with your car that day, you didn't tell me that person was a girl.
[24:12] But... listening to you it seemed to me that it was a man.
[24:18] Areeba, I never got the chance to explain the situation to you. I just mentioned a person, you are the one who decided on their gender.
[24:30] Are you suspecting me because of that girl?
[24:34] What are you saying? I believe you.
[24:40] If that girl was telling the truth, she wouldn't have gotten flustered.
[24:46] She has been blackmailing for a while. First, she asked me to marry her, then she asked for fifty lacs. When I stalled her, she came here.
[24:59] Areeba... if I had wanted to marry someone, I would have done it a long time ago
[25:06] You know for how long my aunt has been pushing me.
[25:11] You don't suspect me right?
[25:16] No... I have no suspicions.
[25:20] If you have a question, then ask it. A while ago there was that incident at the Hyderabad office...
[25:27] No, that was a misunderstanding.
[25:31] I apologized to you for that as well.
[25:36] That's good, it puts me at ease.
[25:43] If you're content, I need to leave. The lawyer has been calling me about some issues with your mother's property papers.
[25:52] Shall I go?
[25:56] Take care... I'll be back early.
[26:45] Fariya! Fariya! Fariya! Where are you?
[26:51] Why are you screaming? I'm not deaf... I can hear you.
I know you're not deaf, but you're blind!
[26:58] What were you thinking when you went to Areeba? Do you know the consequences it could have had?
[27:03] How dare you allege me? You're the fraud, not me.
[27:08] You had an affair with me even though you were married. Then you married me...
[27:12] And when the truth has been unveiled, you're putting it all on me.
Do you have any idea what could have happened?
[27:19] All I know is that you are my husband and I have as much a right over you, as Areeba does.
[27:25] And now I won't live like this.
Lower your voice.
[27:30] Why are you being so rude?
[27:35] First, you're being cruel to my daughter, and on top of that, you're scolding her.
Shut up your nonsense!
[27:42] I'm sure you gave her this idea. Just remember, if you try and be over-smart again, I'll forget that I love you.
[27:55] I will throw you out of my life and this house, understand?
[28:06] Fariya... Fariya...
What happened to my dear daughter?
[28:14] Bring water for her... Fariya, open your eyes.
[28:36] Fariya...
[28:38] Fariya... drink water, my dear child.
[28:45] She was in shock since yesterday and today she's been so restless ever since she came back.
[28:54] Fariya, are you alright?
[28:59] I'm fine, I just felt dizzy.
[29:05] Dizzy... is this sign of a good news.
What?
[29:12] Meaning, maybe Fariya is about to become a mother, and you, a father.
[29:17] What?
[29:21] Thank God... I'll be right back, I need to offer prayers of gratitude.
[29:40] You don't know how great a news you've given me.
[29:47] And today you've caused me the greatest pain.
[29:53] Forgive me, I was compelled to do this. Otherwise, it isn't possible for me to be cruel to you.
[30:02] I can never be cruel to you.
[30:07] You...
[30:09] shouldn't have met Areeba. I've told you a thousand times that the time hasn't come for her to know about our marriage.
[30:20] Will you refuse to accept your child as well, as you do with your wife?
Let the time come...
[30:28] I'll be rid of Areeba long before.
[30:33] I promise.
[31:11] Mother, you didn't do right by instigating a fight between brother Faraz and sister Mahnoor.
[31:17] What about Mahnoor? Was she right?
I asked her to talk to Yasir.
[31:25] The question is, who is Mahnoor to involve herself in this matter?
[31:34] She should have made you understand your foolish decision.
[31:39] Maybe she didn't do that because she's jealous.
[31:45] Jealous that you're getting married in a good home. So she ruined everything as soon as she got the chance.
[31:53] Mother, I don't understand why you have so much hate for sister Mahnoor.
[31:58] Even if she does something good, you find something bad with it.
[32:04] I can see her good deeds. Your tongue has become sharp, be careful, otherwise, I'll cut it off.
[32:13] First, let me talk to the one who asked you to be disrespectful to your mother!
[32:20] Alright... I'll tell brother Faraz that I was the one who asked sister Mahnoor to talk to Yasir.
[32:26] And I will also tell him that you're forcing me to marry.
[32:34] I am so unlucky. The child I'm working so hard for is talking back at me.
[32:44] She's set herself on humiliating me!
[33:09] I think you've done enough studying, and you need a break. That's why I've made coffee for you.
[33:15] Tell me how it is.
[33:26] It's very nice, but why did you go through the trouble?
[33:31] Thank you... I was just in the mood.
[33:35] If you felt like drinking coffee, you could have asked me, I would have made it for you.
[33:41] I needed to cheer you up as well.
[33:46] And, this is the only idea had right now.
[33:50] You were the one who was upset at me and you had every right to be upset.
[33:55] It was my fault. I shouldn't have interfered like this
[34:01] Because of me, things got bad, even though I just wanted to help Aima...
[34:09] Aima is a fool and she's immature. She can talk to everybody...
[34:16] but she didn't talk to me. But you are smart...
[34:21] Why didn't you share it with me?
I made a mistake.
[34:35] You made a mistake, I made a mistake. I think we're even,
[34:42] I'm sorry.
[34:44] That day I shouldn't have overreacted.
[34:56] The coffee is nice.
[34:59] I know.
[35:18] How are you feeling now?
[35:24] Fariya, try and understand. I was forced to come back because of Areeba.
[35:32] Fariya, you need to understand. I want Areeba to not be suspicious about anything.
[35:41] Alright, don't worry. You'll get sick. Just rest.
[35:49] Listen, be ready, I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.
[35:55] Yes, I will take you myself.
[36:27] Yes...
[36:30] Take care of yourself, farewell.
[37:58] What need was there for you to drop that bomb?
If I hadn't done that...
[38:03] then he would have divorced you. He was very angry and I was scared.
[38:09] Where will we arrange this report from?
[38:12] We'll find one. Everything can be doctored.
He will take me to the doctor.
[38:19] How will we arrange this report? This won't stay hidden for long.
[38:23] Look Fariya, you need not worry.
[38:28] This won't be unveiled quickly. Be smart, we only need to buy ourselves a few months.
[38:34] After that, we'll achieve our agenda and we'll leave this place.
He was threatening to leave me.
[38:41] I will be the one to leave him. I will leave him in a way that will make him yearn for his wealth, and his child, which he will never get.
[38:50] And if your plan flops, I won't listen to you at all. I will then do what I think is right.
[38:59] And now I think we need to involve Rameez.
[39:03] Rameez, why?
[39:08] To coerce Saqlain out of his money.
