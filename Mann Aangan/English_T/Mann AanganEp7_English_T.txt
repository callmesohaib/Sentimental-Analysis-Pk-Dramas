[01:08] why are they taking so long!
[01:11] oh God!
[01:13] I'll see him after so many days
[01:20] greetings!
[01:22] greetings to you too! my life
[01:26] stay happy & blessed, may God bless you with a lot of happiness. My eyes were yearning to see you
[01:31] oh aunt, I should feel sorry for you if you are yearning to see him in this technological era
[01:39] let it be! has any mother feel satisfied on the video call?
[01:46] true that!
[01:50] are you satisfied now? I am back here for forever
[01:54] tell me one thing, when I had told you that nobody will come to the airport to pick me. Then why he came?
[02:01] I could have come myself
 Why did you bother him?
[02:04] oh man! its not a big deal. Besides, we don't have one relation but two
[02:10] now, if I will not take care of the tantrums of my stubborn sister in law's to be husband. Then who else will?
[02:15] anyways Saqlain, you & Areeba shall sit & try to explain Mahoor
[02:20] that girls don't look good while insisting a lot
[02:23] and after marriage the girl has to listen to her husband. And it looks good to take the orders from a man
[02:29] now look at yourself, how obedient Areeba is to you
[02:34] aunt, how many times I have told you that there is a lot of difference in Mahnoor & Areeba
[02:39] Areeba isn't so proud about that she is very well educated or she wants to conquer the world
[02:45] however Mahnoor
[02:47] she doesn't value anyone
[02:51] do you remember, how she had refused for Ashir's proposal on your face
[02:58] however, we all know that he is so perfect
[03:03] I'm tired, so I am going to do some rest
[03:06] Ok dear, do some rest. I will send your tea inside your room. OK?
[03:11] I don't need anything, I just want to sleep
[03:18] what do you do, Saqlain?
[03:20] what was the need to refresh the old wounds, and that too in front of Ashir right now?
[03:24] what as such I've said? Since you've talked about explaining Mahnoor, so I've said it accordingly
[03:31] but still, you shouldn't have repeated the matter of rejection right now & that too in front of him
[03:36] only a week is left in the wedding ceremony
[03:38] and you've hurt my son by reminding him that Mahnoor has rejected to marry him
[03:45] this matter will be discussed again & again, aunt
[03:48] if Ashir wants the share of inheritance, then he should remember that Mahnoor had insulted him
[03:55] Okay sit, let me bring tea for you
[03:58] no, there is no need of it. You also rest, as I have to go to the office. I'm leaving
[04:03] Okay
[04:42] now Saqlain will humiliate me
[04:44] Mr. Ashir Ahmed
[04:47] you were insulted, you were rejected
[05:03] your marriage date has been fixed
[05:07] you had thought that you will not do the departure ritual & will keep her on your name for her entire life
[05:20] dear come
[05:23] what is all this?
[05:26] Mahnoor, I've taken out he jewelry for you
[05:30] but mom, this jewelry is yours
[05:34] since you had refused to take the dowry, so I thought to gift you my jewelry on your wedding
[05:42] I don't have all the right on this jewelry
[05:47] Mahnoor, you have refused to take all the rights
[05:51] parents are also humans
[05:54] they aren't angels, they also do make mistakes
[05:59] sometimes they do utter such words which hurt their children
[06:05] whatever I had said to you, please forgive me for that
[06:10] please mom, don't make me feel guilty by saying such things
[06:15] don't say such things that I am unable to face myself
[06:19] whatever you had said, I have forgotten it
[06:23] yes Mahnoor, one needs to suffer in order to release pain
[06:29] I am trying to save my children from the pain
[06:35] may God keep your happy & blessed in your house
[06:40] may you get whatever you want, may you succeed in your motive
[06:45] Saqlain is such a big support for Areeba
[06:49] and in this situation, when she cannot give an offspring to him
[06:55] God forbid if Saqlain...
God forbid that any such thing shall happen
[06:59] whatever you are trying to say, I've understood
[07:02] and you have said the right thing. One needs to suffer through the pain in order to get the pain released
[07:08] its just that the person needs to be strong enough
[07:13] Mahnoor, keep this jewelry & get them fixed as per your desire
[07:17] but mom this jewelry..
if you will refuse, then I will be hurt a lot
[07:23] Okay
[07:25] I will keep this jewelry
[07:28] but I will not get their designs changed
[07:31] dad had got them made for you, right?
[07:34] this jewelry will stay with me as your memorable
[07:40] stay blessed & happy
[07:52] you are absolutely correct! how can mom give her entire jewelry to Mahnoor?
[07:58] maybe she is forgetting that I & Ramsha also have a right on them
[08:03] oho! eventually you have got to know this jewelry matter
[08:07] don't know what not aunt had given Mahnoor from her treasure in order to make her happy
[08:13] and you'll never get to know about it
[08:16] and she'll leave from there quietly after taking everything
[08:19] what treasure my mom have? whatever she has is in front of you
[08:25] I just do the work of a cashier for her, I collect the cash & deposit it in her account
[08:32] where we get the amount of your father's pension, that is 1.5 to 2 lacs
[08:37] ok listen! tell me one thing. Do you have any idea that how much money does my mother have in her bank account
[08:45] how would I know?
[08:48] yes! in fact I know one thing that your mother has agreed to pay 10 lacs as the dowry amount as per my aunt's request
[08:57] as far as wedding expenses are concerned, they are my responsibility
[09:01] it will be adjusted with the rent of the shops
[09:04] and then you'll see
[09:07] your mother will give the share of inheritance to Mahnoor
[09:23] by the way, Mahnoor is such a sly woman
[09:28] earlier, she lifted her character by refusing about everything
[09:31] and now see, she is taking everything
[09:36] this is what I am trying to explain you at all times
[09:41] that Mahnoor does her work in such a clever manner
[09:45] she is hollowing your mother slowly & gradually
[09:48] you & Ramsha will keep on seeing her face
[09:52] what I was thinking! let me separate some amount & keep it in a separate amount every month
[10:00] maybe nothing will be left till Ramsha's wedding
[10:08] you are thinking so correct
[10:12] how good & positive you think about us
[10:18] who else do I have?
[10:20] if I won't think then who else will?
[10:57] what is this drama? End it! I am having a headache
[11:02] its a wedding house
[11:04] the drums will be beaten in the joyous occasion, right?
[11:08] and why are you having a headache? Go & rest
[11:12] are you fine?
[11:13] just tell me, why did you fix my wedding date without my consent?
[11:17] and now all of this drama!
[11:20] so, didn't you wanted to marry?
[11:22] I've spent each & every day while counting
[11:25] and my eyes are yearning to see your happiness
[11:28] I wasn't running anywhere!
[11:31] all of this drama could be done after a year or 6 months
[11:34] I've just completed my studies, still I have to find a job & make my career
[11:39] you can make your career as well, it won't make any difference on our house expense
[11:43] God has blessed us with everything
[11:46] if you won't earn for a year or six months
[11:50] still we can enjoy a luxurious life
[11:53] as far as whatever amount you'll get from Mahnoor's dowry & share of inheritance. You can start your business with it
[12:00] still, job is slavery. No matter if you become a governor
[12:05] one's business is very important, OK?
[12:09] let me send you some tea, go to your room. Your headache will be fine
[12:13] I don't need anything. Just don't make the noise
[12:34] mom, you've given the entire jewelry to Mahnoor
[12:37] without even taking my suggestion
[12:40] it was my jewelry, so I gave her
[12:43] and Areeba, I didn't need your suggestion or permission for it
[12:46] yes, you are absolutely correct
[12:49] but our father had made that jewelry for you, right?
[12:52] and all of us three sisters have got an equal right on it, in the same manner as we have the right on this property
[12:56] Areeba, I've given your share of inheritance to you long time ago without your consent
[13:03] mom, its obvious that you will give it to Mahnoor as well
[13:06] I haven't thought about it as of yet
[13:09] you had said to me yourself, that we shouldn't get ourselves involved into these lawyers etc
[13:14] everyone has considered my husband as a servant
[13:17] the desires are never ending, and what do we get in return?
[13:26] so sister Areeba, you tell us. What do you want in return?
[13:31] you can never give me anything
[13:34] say it, what do you want
[13:37] I've been busy in your wedding preparations since so many months
[13:40] and you were busy in completing your internship & studies
[13:45] I went to the market so many times
[13:48] also Saqlain is too busy, and now your marriage responsibility is on his head
[13:53] now he has to do this work too
[13:56] sister Areeba, that's what I am asking you
[13:58] that what do you & brother Saqlain wants from me & mom in exchange of these favors?
[14:04] we don't want anything, you cannot give us anything
[14:08] even you give us respect with a lot of misery
[14:15] mom, I just want you to keep an equal share for all of us in that jewelry
[14:21] and it should be distributed to us equally
[14:26] because Saqlain says, if we do injustice with a single child
[14:31] then it burdens the parents till the day of judgment
[14:37] absolutely correct!
[14:38] as it is, I never wanted to keep the entire jewelry with me
[14:42] let me do one thing, let me bring the jewelry
[14:44] then mom will distribute it to the three of us, in front of you & Ramsha
[14:49] Mahnoor...
[14:50] its Ok mom
[14:52] what is all this happening?
[14:54] let her bring them
[15:05] what have you decided then? What are your plans?
[15:09] will you do the job, or will do business in Mahnoor's shops?
[15:15] by the way, shall I give you a suggestion?
[15:17] try to do on your own, whatever you do
[15:22] Mahnoor is such an ill-mannered girl
[15:26] she doesn't stops herself from taunting
[15:32] even mom was telling me the same thing again & again, that Mahnoor misbehaves with you
[15:37] after all, what is the enmity?
[15:39] why she doesn't respects you? She doesn't even respects your relation with her?
[15:41] what to tell you!
[15:45] I feel ashamed to tell you
[15:47] tell me, don't feel ashamed in front of me
[15:54] actually... 
[15:58] she had an affair with a rich boy, he was quite a licentious guy
[16:05] I told aunt when I got to know
[16:08] the took that matter to her heart
[16:13] Mahnoor was having an affair
[16:21] look, I didn't wanted to tell you this matter. But since you've asked me so... 
[16:28] actually, that guy came to our house few days before your arrival
[16:35] we got rid of him with a lot of difficulty
[16:38] and seriously, Mahnoor didn't had any association with this matter
[16:43] that poor girl was compelled by her heart
[16:47] the actual culprit was that guy who had trapped her in his love
[16:53] thanks to God that I got to know the entire matter on the right time
[16:57] in fact, Mahnoor has refused for your proposal because of that guy
[17:03] my point still stands!
[17:09] Mahnoor was having an affair & still you had convinced my mother for my marriage with her
[17:18] do you think, if I would have known this matter then I would have convinced aunt for this proposal?
[17:24] yes?
[17:25] I got to know about it when you had already married her, and nothing could have happened at that time
[17:32] anyways... 
[17:34] forget that matter. That's history
[17:39] she is your wife now, that matter has ended
[17:44] relax!
[17:46] Besides, people do such mistakes on college & university levels. You must have done these mistakes too
[17:53] I don't think so that we need to create such a big issue out of it
[17:57] right?
[17:59] he is gone!
[18:02] right
[18:05] the matter has ended
[18:13] gone!
[18:16] yeah, gone!
[18:30] here you go, mom
[18:36] this is the jewelry
[18:39] mom can do whatever she wants to do with them
[22:01] Mahnoor
[22:02] yes, she is inside
[22:06] let me take you to her, please come in
[22:16] take care of all the work, as I will be busy then
[22:21] maam, brother Ashir is here
[22:23] hey Ashir! how are you? Is everything fine?
[22:28] greetings!*
[22:29] Salma, quickly go & do arrangements for the tea
[22:32] there is no need for that, I have come to meet Mahnoor
[22:34] No, no.. this is not possible because yesterday we did her henna ceremony
[22:40] and now both of you cannot meet each other
[22:44] even I think the same that some matters shall be discussed after marriage
[22:52] sister, I want to meet Mahnoor its important
[22:56] really!
[22:57] yes
[22:59] Ramsha, do one thing. Bring Mahnoor here
[23:02] Okay
[23:03] if you don't mind, I want to talk to Mahnoor in private
[23:08] if you allow me then can I go inside her room
[23:14] Okay fine, Ramsha take him
[23:16] go
[23:18] please come
[23:26] sister, brother Ashir is here
[23:39] there must be some important discussion
[23:43] I think, he must be missing sister so much that he came here himself
[24:00] you & here!
[24:03] is everything fine?
[24:16] I've got to know the reason
[24:20] that why you had rejected me
[24:25] and frankly it doesn't make any difference to me, if you were involved with someone or you had boyfriend
[24:36] but there is one thing, which effects me
[24:42] you had rejected me
[24:47] I get hurt over here
[24:53] I had planned long time ago to take the revenge of my insult from you
[25:01] because I never wanted to waste my life with an egotistic & arrogant girl like you
[25:14] So... Mrs. Mahnoor
[25:19] I divorce you!
[25:39] why Ashir came so early in the morning to talk to Mahnoor?
[25:44] I pray that everything is fine
[25:45] I divorce you!
[25:51] No... no, you cannot do this to me. My mother... 
[25:58] you cannot do this. No!
[26:11] I divorce you!
[26:19] your henna looks so good
[26:37] I am feeling so anxious
[26:38] mom, brother Ashir is here
[26:40] hey Ashir
[26:43] have you talked to Mahnoor?
[26:49] Ashir! dear listen to me 
Ashir!
[26:52] Ashir, at least listen to me dear
[26:56] what had happened? Why did he left without talking?
[27:19] Areeba, I am feeling so anxious
[27:20] mom, please relax
[27:23] quickly go & bring water for mom
[27:25] oh God! I just pray that everything is well
mom!
[27:26] let me talk to Mahnoor, please come & sit here
[27:43] Mahnoor, that Ashir... 
[27:55] Ashir has taken his revenge from me for his insult
[28:02] he has divorced me
[28:07] what!
[28:09] do you know what you are saying!
[28:11] I know
[28:13] I know... 
[28:15] Ashir has divorced me
[28:20] what!
[28:23] what is she saying?
[28:27] what is she saying!
[28:29] mom! ... mom
[28:32] mom! mom, what happen to you? Open your eyes
[28:37] quickly bring water
mom!
[28:40] *indistinct noise*
[29:02] this boy doesn't tell me anything
[29:06] he leaves the house whenever he feels like
[29:09] he already knows that a wedding is going on in the house, & there are a lot of work. But no!
[29:15] he doesn't even care that its his own wedding
[29:18] he hasn't bought his wedding dress as of yet
[29:28] where have you gone so early in the morning?
[29:29] I had gone to fix a matter
[29:33] which matter?
[29:36] and what dues you have with someone?
[29:39] it was a loan kind of
[29:41] it was my insult, and it was a loan so I had to repay it
[29:46] why are you beating about the bush? I don't get it, tell me the matter clearly
[29:51] oho! I just divorced Mahnoor
[29:55] what! what are you saying? tomorrow is your wedding
[30:00] don't over react
[30:02] first of all, I haven't planned to marry that egoistic & arrogant girl
[30:06] also you had fixed the dates, & my wedding without even asking me
[30:11] but now when I've got to know about her character, it was impossible for me to accept her 
[30:17] that's why I have ended the relation. Why are you over reacting so much?
[30:21] what have you done?
[30:41] doctor, is everything fine?
[30:48] her BP is very high, it will take some time to get normal
[30:53] besides, she is in a lot of stress & shock. Try to keep her away from worries
[30:59] its very important to monitor her BP, if she gets unwell then bring her to the hospital
[31:05] I ma prescribing few medicines
[31:18] listen
[31:20] please talk to aunt
[31:23] how can Ashir do this?
[31:25] I will talk to her later, but right now I am worried about your mother
[31:29] doctor, how is mom?
[31:33] God willing she will be fine. I've prescribed the medicines, and have explained in detail. Try to keep her way from the worries
[31:39] don't give her anymore tensions
[31:41] thank you, doctor
come, let me drop you
[31:48] I don't understand
[31:51] how come we are facing a lot of difficulties all of a sudden
[31:56] mom!
[31:59] Mahoor's affair with some guy!
[32:03] yes
[32:04] No, no... I don't believe it
[32:08] am I lying to you?
[32:10] No.. why will you lie to me?
[32:13] such a big decision & that too without any thinking or so
[32:17] you should have told me, I would have gone & talked to them myself. You had done everything so quietly
[32:23] what will you talk to them?
[32:26] I didn't wanted to marry Mahnoor
[32:28] if you didn't wanted to marry her, then why you did contractual marriage!
[32:31] why did you convince Mahnoor for the contractual marriage by compelling Areeba & Saqlain?
[32:36] A very very good question
[32:41] it has never happened in my life that somebody shall insult me & I don't take its revenge
[32:46] Mahnoor had rejected me for someone else
[32:49] how could I tolerate that insult? so I took the revenge
[32:54] its gone!  in the words of Mr. Saqlain its all gone
[32:59] but what will I answer Saqlain now?
[33:02] and what will I tell those people, who are ready to attend your wedding tomorrow?
[33:06] there is no need to answer Saqlain! Ask Saqlain for the clarification
[33:12] that why he tried to make a relation with us, by keeping his sister in law's character a secret?
[33:18] and tell the people that the girl was characterless
[33:22] she used to meet her ex-lovers, that's why we have ended the relation
[33:26] its done & dusted
[33:29] Case closed!
[33:34] hmm...
[33:36] I will ask Saqlain to give the clarification
[33:39] I will make sure to ask him
[33:59] Mrs. Mahnoor, I divorce you!
[35:03] you haven't done the right thing, Saqlain
[35:05] first of all, whatever Mahnoor's reality was... you should have told be earlier
[35:10] so that I wouldn't have gone with her marriage proposal
[35:12] and now, since this matter got exposed. So what was the need to tell Ashir? You should have told me
[35:17] aunt, how would I know that Ashir will do all this
[35:21] I had shared Mahnoor's matter with Ashir just like that
[35:25] so that he should be knowing about her life, as she is his wife
[35:28] I thought he will show his noble attitude but
[35:32] you've said such a weird thing
[35:34] a guy gets to know that his wife is having an affair with another man, & he shall tolerate it!
[35:41] you tell me, can you show your noble attitude in this matter for Areeba?
[35:44] why do you drag Areeba in between?
[35:47] I've told you numerous times that there is a lot of difference between Areeba & Mahnoor
[35:50] So, why did you brought your sister in law's proposal?
[35:52] why did you kept a hope with me that I will fix my one & only intelligent & wise son's marriage with such a girl
[35:59] whose love stories are famous in the entire world!
[36:01] oh aunt, I made a mistake! I wanted to do a good deed but everything went wrong
[36:07] here you are scolding me, & there Areeba's family will scold me
[36:11] who dares to scold you!
[36:14] their daughter's actions aren't good, & they are scolding you!
[36:17] aunt, try to understand. Its such a difficult time for them. Their daughter got divorced!
[36:23] aunt is extremely unwell. I fear, what if she dies in this grief
[36:28] by the way, they say the right thing on this occasion
[36:30] that a person shall always pray to God for a pious & obedient children
[36:35] and honestly speaking, I am feeling so bad for your mother in law
[36:39] because I had never wanted all this
[36:42] but I want it to happen
[36:44] I want to see Mahnoor's lowered face & defeat in her eyes
[36:48] and because of Ashir, I've achieved my motive
[36:52] anyways aunt, what can be done now? Whatever had to happen, has happened already
[36:54] what's done can't be undone
[36:58] it would be better to accept this reality
[37:22] take it
[37:24] what is this?
[37:25] divorce papers! give them to Mahnoor
[37:31] I am very well aware of your inner stubbornness
[37:36] but I didn't had an idea that you will take such a hasty decision
[37:40] even I didn't had an idea, that you will make my innocent mother a fool for your in-laws
[37:46] I am not among those people, who tolerates betrayal for the greed of wealth, property & dowry
[37:52] I haven't made anyone a fool! I got to know all those things just now
[37:56] Besides, you haven't divorced Mahnoor because of her affair. But because of the rejection of your proposal
[38:03] am I right?
[38:05] its my mistake
[38:07] I shouldn't have initiated the topic of the marriage of you two
[38:10] just because of this new relation, the old relations are getting bitter
[38:14] Oh.. poor you!
[38:49] mom
[38:51] what happened?
[38:54] what had happened?
[38:55] what happen, are you fine?
[38:58] why did it happen, Mahi?
[39:01] all of this was written in my fate
[39:04] why Ashir did this with you?
[39:11] where is Saqlain? Tell him to go & ask his aunt that why did Ashir divorced you before the departure ritual?
[39:21] why did he left?
[39:25] please control yourself
[39:29] brother Saqlain must be there
[39:32] what will happen by doing this?
[39:34] fight, arguments etc...
[39:37] No Mahi no...
[39:41] No... what had happen, Mahi!
[39:44] please don't cry you will get unwell. Please control yourself
[39:49] see, I am perfectly fine. 
You used to say
[39:53] that whatever is written in one's fate cannot be changed
[39:57] I am fine... please don't cry
