[01:36] Ramsha... Ramsha...
[01:41] Is that girl even awake yet, or not? 
There should be a limit to such things
[01:46] Mother, what's wrong? Why are you being so angry?
[01:48] Look at how irresponsible she is.
[01:52] The van guy will be here any moment, he will blow his horn and disturb the entire neighborhood.
[01:57] I have a solution for this. 
[02:00] Go upstairs, I'll bring you breakfast and I'll wake her up as well. Don't be angry.
[02:05] Wake her up and make her understand as well.
Sure.
[02:08] There should be a limit to one's irresponsibility.
[02:12] Ramsha!
[02:15] Get up... you will be scolded by mother very badly.
[02:19]  You never learn. I'm making breakfast for mother, so get up!
[02:22] What is the problem?
[02:25] Everyone knows I have to go to college daily and I have to get up daily for it...
[02:31] Besides, the divas are always last to show up.
[02:36] So why don't they wait for a while?
[02:56] Yes, this much is enough.
[03:23] Greetings*
Here is your breakfast.
[03:30] The color of the tea is very good.
I'll feel better if the taste is as better.
[03:38] I'll check on Ramsha, and see if she's ready or not.
I'll get ready for work as well, I'm running late.
[03:48] I wonder when will Ramsha change and take a hold of some responsibilities around the house.
[04:07] Get up, the tea is getting cold.
[04:41] Is the sugar alright?
[04:44] It's just fine.
[04:51] Did you iron my clothes?
[04:53] Yes, I have. Take a shower, until then I'll serve breakfast.
[05:01] Hurry up... I have to sort out your mother's issues before work. There is a new problem every day.
[05:10] Don't we have enough problems? Then why do we have to include other people's problems in our life?
[05:17] If I refuse then it will look bad.
[05:22] No, it's not like that.
[05:33] Alright fine...
[06:02] Where is she? That girl has never been to college on time. Ramsha hurry up, you're running late.
[06:19] The phone is ringing, where is it?
[06:32] Let's go... I'll get late again as well.
[06:44] Wear your shoes...
It's fine that way... alright then...
[06:51] Farewell*
Oh my God... he blows his horn so hard!
[07:00] I'm coming... wait!
Ramsha, why do you do this every day?
[07:07] My throat gets sore from waking you up every day and this van guy...
[07:12] he blows the horn so hard. The entire neighborhood gets disturbed...
[07:17] but you're so stubborn that it does not affect you.
[07:19] I have a good answer for you, but right now I'm running late.
[07:23] Farewell.
Come back then...
[07:28] I'll sort you out then.
[07:32] She left the door open as well.
[08:09] What is the problem?
[08:13] Why are you boiling your blood? You know it will not affect her.
[08:17] Let her come back in the evening...
[08:18] I'll sort her out in such a way that it will have a lasting effect.
[08:24] Why are you getting so angry at her? All girls her age is like that.
[08:30] But you have become very strict towards her.
[08:32] You were not like that. You're only two years older than her.
[08:36] You go to university, you have a job and you make breakfast as well.
[08:41] When you come back from work, you also make dinner. On top of that, you read those books as well.
[08:46] That girl doesn't even do one thing properly.
I don't have a job, I have an internship.
[08:52] Besides, college studies are very hard.
It's like she's the only one who is a human.
[09:00] Rather, she's the best of human beings...
No, you're completely wrong about that.
[09:07] Because someone else is the best among human beings...
[09:12] I don't understand...
I'm talking about brother Saqlain...
[09:16] He's an angel...
For God's sake mother...
[09:19] Let him stay human, don't turn him into an angel, otherwise, you'll be disappointed someday.
[09:29] Sometimes I think I've made a mistake by educating you too much,
[09:35] You are making fun of me.
I can never make fun of you.
[09:47] I'm running late, I should get going. I wonder if the cab is here or not.
[09:55] Yes, it's here.
[09:58] Farewell, mother. Don't worry if I'm late.
[10:05] Farewell*
[10:19] Greetings*
[10:22] How are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
[10:25] I'm fine as well.
[10:26] Are you going to university? Come on, I'll drop you off.
[10:30] No... thank you so much. Why would you go through the trouble? 
[10:33] Besides I'm going to work, not university.
[10:39] Farewell.
[10:43] Saqlain my dear. Greetings. When did you get here?
Just now.
[10:49] Come in...
[10:56] I was going to go and solve that store issue. That guy is holding the rent and causing a lot of issues.
[11:02] I think now it's time we'll have to use the stick.
[11:06] My dear, don't fight with him too much.
[11:08] We don't need the money that much. I'm fine with the money he's giving us
[11:14] It's not about the money, it's about the principal. 
[11:17] It's written in his contract that he'll fulfill the rent every three years.
[11:22] Anyways, don't worry about him. He's my problem now.
[11:25] Bless you, my dear. I don't worry when you're here. You've handled everything so brilliantly
[11:33] Mahnoor's father used to do this but after he was gone...
You should worry a bit as well...
[11:40] Such a lack of worry is not good.
What do you mean my dear?
[11:45] I saw Ramsha outside in the van, she was chuckling out loud in the van.
[11:51] Try and make her understand that girls from good families don't behave this way.
[11:55] And ask her to sit inside the van.
[11:57]  If something were to happen, I'll be the one who will be embarrassed.
[12:03] Alright, my dear, don't get angry, I'll make her understand when she comes here.
[12:11] Shall I make tea for you?
No need, I had breakfast at home.
[12:15] I should get going to work. I'll get you the groceries in the evening. I hope there's no rush, will you be able to manage?
[12:22] Don't worry about it, everything is present at home. Get it for us, when you have the time.
[12:28] Alright, I'll get going then.
[12:32] Bless you.
Farewell*
[12:49] Who are all these people?
They are here for interviews.
[12:53] It means that he's very busy. I needed to discuss something with him.
[12:58] I'll do it late...
Excuse me...
[13:02] Yes?
You're Mr. Khalil's daughter, right?
[13:06] But, who are you? I didn't recognize you.
We are your tenants.
[13:14] Oh... I don't know who lives in our home. My brother-in-law takes care of such matters.
[13:21] Yes, your father was a nice and kind-hearted man. He never bothered us.
[13:28] Who is bothering you?
[13:30] Your father and my father were friends. He knew our conditions.
[13:35] That's why he had fixed a low rent, he did that as to not hurt my father's ego.
[13:41] He wanted to take no rent. But now the rent is being increased every year, which we cannot afford.
[13:48] My father has lost his job, and on top of that, he's sick.
[13:51]  I was thinking of coming to you guys and talking about it...
[13:54] We're very worried, and we can't take it anymore. It's a coincidence that I recognized you
[14:01] Your picture was in the newspapers after you got that position.
[14:07] Don't worry about it, there will be no burden on you anymore.
Alright.
[14:12] I came here for a job, please pray for me.
All the best.
[14:36] You got ready so quickly. The wedding is at night, will you leave now?
[14:42] Who's going to the wedding? I have some work that I need to do.
[14:45] You said that you intended on going to Fawad's wedding, that's why you don't want to visit Saqlain.
[14:51] I didn't promise, I just said it. 
[14:53] It's not like he properly invited me. He saw that I was in Pakistan and he invited me.
[14:58] It's been two days since I've been in Pakistan, why should I run off to meet your loving nephew?
[15:05] During your childhood, we brought you to the city and then you went abroad for studies...
[15:11] but you still have that feudal approach to things, just like your father? Why do you take everything to your ego?
[15:20] One shouldn't be hurt by what friends do. That's not how it's supposed to be.
[15:28] Anyways, what can I say? Saqlain, respect me a lot.
[15:34] When you're not here, he is the one who takes care of me.
[15:39] Think how I would have managed if he wasn't here.
[15:42] You think it's my ego, but I think it's my insult.
[15:46] Everyone has their point of view. As far as you living alone is concerned...
[15:51] In a few months, I'll be back, and that will be solved as well.
[15:54] Yes, indeed. You should go to Fawad's wedding.
[15:59] He's your childhood friend, and he won't come to your wedding if you don't go.
[16:03] I don't care.
[16:06] I don't care if anyone comes to my wedding. It's not like I'm getting married tomorrow.
[16:09] If it were up to me, I would marry you tomorrow.
[16:12] All of your friends are married, I have chosen a lot f girls and...
No...
[16:20] We will not talk about this. It's been only two days.
[16:23] If not right now, we will talk about it later.
[16:26] And I will do this at any cost before you leave.
[16:31] Mother... my dear mother, that will affect my studies badly.
[16:36] My time is very important, my attention will get diverted. 
[16:41] I need my attention to be, where I need it to be.
[16:46] Marriage is an important life decision. I'll engage you before you leave.
[16:54] And... when your education is complete, I'll marry you when you come back.
[16:57] Sure... we'll talk about this later.
[17:01] I'll get going...
[17:02] I made breakfast for you. Sit down and have breakfast.
[17:06] This tea was enough breakfast for me...
[17:10] Hurry on back at night, I'll be waiting for you.
Farewell.
[17:15] That boy doesn't listen. 
[17:18] What should I do with all this breakfast?
[17:23] Now the rent is increased every year, which we cannot afford. Father lost his job and he's unwell too.
[17:51] It seems you are lost deep in your thoughts.
[17:56] It seems you're thinking about something special.
[18:00] Work... I don't even have any average ideas.
[18:03] Nothing special.
[18:05] Stop writing then, what need is there to bang your head over this?
[18:10] Let's go out somewhere and have lunch.
[18:15] No... I can't leave this, besides I have to finish this content at any cost today.
[18:22] Mahnoor you take your work way too seriously.
[18:27] Have you ever seen me like this?
[18:32] Yes... because you do this as per your liking and I love this work. You know that, right?
[18:39] After two days my university will start and I won't find the time for this.
[18:44] Try taking some time out for me, 
[18:48] I need your time as well.
[18:53] Tell me...
[18:55] What are you worried about?
[18:58] I'm not worried, the problem is that life is small and I have to do a lot.
[19:06] I have to prepare for exams and then I have to complete this content.
[19:10] And there are thousand other things.
[19:14] You think that I can't read your face. I know very well...
[19:20] that you're disturbed. 
[19:22] Tell me, what is the problem?
[20:06] Mother, I swear I didn't do that.
[20:09] Why did you put your face out the window and chuckle so loudly?
[20:13] If you ever do something like that I'll make you sit at home, understand?
[20:19] So what if I sat on the outside seat, I feel suffocated inside. What's so wrong with what I did?
[20:26] Why don't you get smart about this?
[20:30] If Saqlain sees you again, he'll get very angry.
Why would he get angry?
[20:38] Why would he be angry?
[20:40]  I ask you why does he intrude so much in our life.
[20:45] Did father make him our security guard?
You're talking nonsense.
[20:50] He's like your elder brother. 
[20:53] He takes care of us and he takes on responsibility for this house.
[20:58] If he weren't here...
[20:59] Nothing would have happened... when father died, God didn't leave us.
[21:05] And I know that in the future God will help us as well.
[21:10] Besides, worldly support is only temporary.
[21:12] You're saying that because you're educated.
[21:19] It was a hard time when your father died, if it weren't for Saqlain...
[21:27] then today...
[21:50] I'm not dead, I'm still alive...
[21:53] I know you've studied more than me, but I'm your mother...
[21:59] It's not like that. Who's refusing to follow your orders, all I'm saying...
[22:06] is that who gave brother Saqlain the right to affect our environment badly?
[22:12] I gave him that right?
[22:15] He takes care of this house, he worries himself for us.
[22:19] Because of him, we get all our rent for our shops and houses, at home.
[22:25] If we had to do this ourselves, then tell me, how would we have done this?
[22:30] There should be a limit to one's ingratitude. 
[22:33] Seven years have passed since your sister's marriage.
[22:38] Still, she doesn't have a child, but still, he's with your sister.
[23:45] What did you do? So much salt?
[23:48] It's like poison!
Is it that much?
[23:53] I added the usual amount.
[23:56] Are you trying to say that I'm lying?
I'll make something new for you.
[24:05] No need... I'll eat out.
No need for that. It will take two minutes.
[24:11] You should have done that earlier.
[24:13] maybe I made a mistake. But I'll be careful in the future.
[24:24] I'm already very worried, and you don't take care of me.
Is everything alright at work?
[24:32] It's not work, it's your family.
[24:35] Gathering the rent, depositing it in their account.... 
[24:38] buying the groceries... on top of that there's so much else to do.
[24:42] After that, I had to drop Mahnoor off at the university.
[24:47] I can understand. You do more than your fair share for us.
[24:52] You have taken responsibility for everyone. Mother, Mahi... Ramsha...
[24:58] I'm gracious indebted to you.
Auntie Irham often tells me...
[25:04] that I should marry again.
[25:08] But my heart isn't set on it. If we don't have a child...
[25:13] then it's not your fault. 
[25:16] We can't do anything in front of God's will.
[25:26] I'll make something.
[26:17] What are you doing?
Can't you see what I'm doing?
[26:23] Thank God there were lentils made at home because of brother Saqlain, otherwise, we'd had to stay hungry all night.
[26:29] I asked mother if I should do the groceries, but mother refused, saying that brother Saqlain might mind.
[26:35] He'll die... if we had even gone to buy a gram of sugar he would have acted like the sky was falling.
[26:43] I won't be able to eat lentils... I'm very hungry...
[26:48] I'm ordering something for myself, will you eat something?
I don't want to eat, you can order for yourself.
[26:57] I don't have money, give me some.
[26:59] I'm not asking mother, she will scold me.
[27:04] Alright... sure. Take it from my purse.
Thank you.
[27:11] Who's calling you at this hour?
It's my friend.
[27:17] I know who's calling you at this hour, let me talk to him.
[27:30] Where's that money?
[27:34] Were you sleeping?
Not so early. Ramsha just ordered pizza.
[27:41] It will take an hour till it's delivered and until then she will keep blabbing.
[27:46] You didn't tell me why you were worried at work today.
[27:51] It's just...
[27:54] When someone wants to do something and can't, then one does get upset.
[27:59] What is it that you can't do?
[28:02] You're the person who takes life on like a challenge.
[28:08] When did you get so helpless?
[28:10] We don't have power over anything.
[28:14] Some things we need to endure because they are attached to the happiness of people we care about.
[28:20] There's nothing greater than the happiness of our family.
You're right.
[29:07] You know, auntie often asks me to marry again.
[29:32] Turn off the lights, I'm tired.
[30:42] Wow... amazing. It seems brother Saqlain is coming today.
[30:49] Because all preparations are for him.
[30:52] We'll be humiliated by him if we don't prepare for him.
[31:00] He'll humiliate us nonetheless. He will find something, and you can bet me on that.
[31:08] What vile things are you two saying about your brother-in-law, have you guys no shame?
[31:16] Ramsha help your sister. I don't want to hear anything like that again. 
[31:20] Hurry up... Areeba and Saqlain will be here any moment.
[31:24] It makes no difference if sister Areeba comes or not. All of this is for your son-in-law, who in actuality is your son.
[31:33] Yes, he is my son. He's the son-in-law of this house and sons-in-law should be respected.
[31:39] Sure... the nonsense you two talk about.
[31:44] You don't let us say anything in front of brother Saqlain.
[31:47] Don't act so smart, otherwise, I'll give you a backhand. Help your sister.
[31:53] And yes... don't do anything stupid in front of Saqlain, understand?
[31:59] Can anyone say anything in front of brother Saqlain, does he even allow that?
Silence yourself.
[32:23] Forget it... I'll ask the maids to take them inside.
[32:28] It's alright... they are very small. I can carry them.
[32:31] All these gifts belong to Ramsha and Mahnoor. You wasted so much time buying those for them.
[32:37] Besides, I won't like it if you carry things for someone else.
[32:43] Come in, I'll ask them to get it.
[32:55] Mother! Mahnoor!
[33:07] Areeba you're here!
[33:18] I can't seem to find the time. Where are Mahnoor and Ramsha?
[33:22] They're in the kitchen, preparing lunch.
[33:26] That means that you've gone through so much trouble for us again.
[33:30] Bless you, my dear.
[33:32] I've asked you so many times to not go through this trouble, and I feel ashamed.
[33:37] It's not trouble, who will I make lunch for if not you guys?
I tell mother...
[33:45] the same thing. Brother Saqlain is no stranger. He comes here daily to make us work.
[33:56] Mahnoor is right. I don't like making you work.
[34:01] From now on whenever we come here we'll eat whatever is made.
[34:06] Alright fine... remember that for the future. 
[34:10] Don't forget about it when we make lentils and rice in the future.
[34:16] Silence yourself. Don't bother him. Come inside my dear.
[34:22] Let them joke around. Who will they joke around with, if not me?
[34:27] You know this is how our relationship is.
[34:31] I brought your medicine. They were short in the market, so I had to visit a few pharmacies.
[34:40] These are some gifts from Areeba and me...
[34:45] for Ramsha and Mahnoor...
There was no need for this...
[34:49] You do so much for them. Because of them, they are in this position.
[34:55] What are you saying? That's very bad... 
[34:59] why are you giving credit brother Saqlain for our hard work?
[35:03] He only helps us financially... otherwise we help ourselves.
[35:14] Does everything happen on its own?
[35:18] You two stay busy with your studies.
[35:22] Saqlain wastes his energy on you two...
[35:30] Forget this... don't mind them.
[35:38] Mother is right. Let's forget about this and talk about business.
[35:43] Brother Saqlain, that other home we have, father has fixed its rent, it has been like that for a long time...
[35:50] But you are increasing the rent for it every year and you haven't told anyone about this.
[36:12] Indeed, that is true.
[36:16] But not as much as that property is worth. I shared that with auntie, maybe you remember it.
[36:26] I can't keep track of such things.
You maybe don't... but I do...
[36:33] Auntie, the property tax and maintenance goes from that money. There are other requirements as well.
[36:41] If you have any doubts I can write it for you.
[36:48] Why would you do that? 
[36:51] There is no one here who should be asking you for an account for anything.
[36:57] If she has a complaint, then that means that she wants an account. I'm not a cheater auntie...
[37:04] Nor am I in any greed. 
[37:08] I'm doing this because I want to do something good for you...
[37:13] But I think you won't be needing me anymore, so from now on I won't be doing anything.
[37:21] I won't be able to help you out.
[37:30] Mahnoor has grown up.
[37:34] She can do everything on her own.
[37:38] No Saqlain, she cannot.
That's not my problem.
[37:45] I should get going.
What about lunch?
[37:48] There will be no need for that.
[37:56] What Mahnoor said was enough for me.
[38:03] Are you coming, or do you want to stay?
I'm coming.
[38:06] I think you should stay. 
[38:09] They worked hard on making lunch. 
[38:12] It will go to waste.
[38:14] Saqlain... listen to me...
Sister...
[38:34] Wait... I will go with you.
