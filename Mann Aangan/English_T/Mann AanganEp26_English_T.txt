[01:21] How long will it take for our passports to get made?
Not long.
[01:26] Do you know how nice you are?
[01:30] You don't refuse anything I say and that makes me love you more
[01:35] It's because you are so important to me. As time passes you are becoming more important to me.
[01:41] Without you, it's hard to make time pass by.
Then don't leave me to go to Areeba.
[01:49] I don't want to go there. I don't even want to see her face.
[01:54] But what can I do? Besides, we will be together next week and no one will bother us.
[02:04] Should we do some shopping? I think it will be very cold in Turkey.
[02:09] I did find out about that and yes it will be very cold.
[03:28] This doesn't seem nice to me...
[03:34] I'm shopping with your money, but I'll return your money tomorrow.
[03:40] Why would you do that? It's a gift from me to you.
[03:45] Gift?
Yes... why?
[03:49] Like Aruba is a friend of yours and how she can give you gifts...
[03:53] Am I not your friend?
No, it's not like that.
[03:59] You're my friend as well... but...
But?
[04:06] Look, I don't want to hurt your feeling at all.
[04:10] And thank you for this.
[04:15] There's a shop there which sells perfumes.
[04:22] I needed to buy some perfume, can we go there?
Of course, why not? Let's go there.
[04:28] Come on.
[04:51] What happened?
Brother Saqlain is inside. It will be trouble if he sees us. Let's go!
[04:58] This wretched man... he always comes out of nowhere to become a bother for me. Because of him, I can't buy my perfume.
[05:08] Alright, let's go.
[06:01] Sister...
[06:05] What's the matter? Mother was telling me that you are very worried.
[06:13] I'm worried because of my mother.
[06:23] Look... because of mother all of us are worried...
[06:27] But I know that you're upset because of something else. That day I noticed that you were very silent and worried that day.
[06:37] Is everything alright? Did you argue with brother Saqlain?
[06:43] No... we had no argument.
[06:48] Then what is the matter? Share it with me... I'm your sister.
[06:54] It's possible that I can find a solution to this.
[06:58] If you share with me it will lessen the load off of your heart.
[07:06] Mahnoor... sometimes it seems to me that Saqlain has grown tired of me. He always works...
[07:17] He just works. It seems that he uses his work as an excuse to not spend time with me,
[07:27] Are you sure that he's only because of work?
[07:33] I mean... is there someone...
[07:48] Another woman in her life?
No sister, I didn't mean that at all.
[07:54] I might have a million indifferences with brother Saqlain, but I cannot guide you wrong in his matter.
[08:00] You're the one who is always telling me that brother Saqlain is your biggest support. He went against his aunt's wishes of remarrying him.
[08:12] It is like that.
If he wanted to marry another woman, he would have done it then.
[08:20] He had the right to do that as well.
I don't understand what you're saying.
[08:28] If that isn't the reason... then why is Saqlain drifting away from me?
[08:34] Is your behavior the reason behind him drifting away?
[08:39] I can feel that you're worried...
[08:46] You've consumed yourself with the fact that you don't have a child.
[08:51] I think this is the reason that you're overthinking and staying worried.
[08:57] You're driving brother Saqlain away.
[09:03] It's not in your hands, nor his for you guys to have children.
[09:08] This is in the hands of God, that's why I think you shouldn't overthink this.
[09:16] The desire of having a child is built in all of us. That is Saqlain's wish as well...
[09:26] I get scared when I...
[09:33] think that he might leave me.
Don't think so negatively. That is not good for your mental health.
[09:43] I'm just worried for mother. I want to take a second opinion about her condition.
[09:52] Once I get done with this... I'll take an appointment with a great doctor and take you there.
[10:00] I've taken an appointment with a doctor. Be sure to come with me.
Alright, we'll go together.
[10:11] Ramsha was telling me that you lost a chain that brother Faraz gave to you.
[10:18] Yes...
Where can it go from your room? You should take care of your stuff.
[10:24] I don't what happened, I looked everywhere, but I can't find it.
It's obvious that someone from your home took it.
[10:31] No... why would someone do that?
The chain didn't just get and walk away.
[10:41] I'm sure someone took it.
I don't know. As I said, you won't worry about anything else.
[10:51] No matter what problem it is, you can call me and meet up with me.
[10:57] I know.
[11:26] Pass me the bread.
[11:38] Here you go.
[11:44] Did you find your chain? Did you check at your mother's place?
Yes, I checked everywhere.
[11:51] It isn't there. I told you that I didn't take it there.
[11:57] It's possible that you didn't bring it here.
Mother, I think we should finish this topic here.
[12:05] Mahnoor has looked for it everywhere, what can we do if she couldn't find it?
[12:11] But, be careful moving forward. Your things are your responsibility.
[12:20] Next time if you lose anything, no one should ask us any questions.
[12:54] Ramsha! Ramsha!
[13:04] Yes, mother?
How much money did Saqlain give you yesterday? These are a little less.
[13:12] I needed some money, so I took some.
[13:18] You are wasting money. I just gave your pocket money to you last week and I also gave you money separately to shop.
[13:25] Yes, you did. But I needed money to buy my friend a gift for her birthday. That's why I took it from you.
[13:35] Didn't you hear what Saqlain said... he said that we need to control our expenses.
[13:42] You should stop wasting money. I don't want to add any burden on Saqlain.
[13:50] Sure...
I don't want you to make this mistake again.
[14:07] Shall I keep this?
Sure.
[14:19] What about this one?
[14:21] No, not this one... the other one.
Sure.
[14:29] How about this one?
Yes.
[14:40] I wanted to ask you when you will be back from Turkey.
It will take me a week.
[14:47] And yes... you should pack your stuff. Go to your mother, otherwise, I will be worried that youâ€™re staying here alone.
[14:55] I need to have these papers signed by auntie tomorrow. I'll drop you off and have these signed.
[15:05] I talked to the property dealer. By the time I come back this property issue will be resolved as well.
[15:13] Are you going alone?
[15:22] What do you mean? Who else will go with me?
[15:26] You said that it was a business tour, so I thought that you were going with some office colleagues.
[15:36] No, I'm going alone.
[15:46] Put these papers in my briefcase.
[15:53] Sure.
[16:40] Whose books are these?
[16:43] Mine...
Yours?
[16:48] They are way too much... it seems you like studying.
[16:53] One has to study a lot to do their CSS.
CSS?
[16:58] You're preparing for the CSS exams?
[17:03] Yes... this is a dream of mine.
[17:08] Why didn't you fulfill this wish?
[17:14] Some incidents happened in my life...
[17:18] that I had to start working, then I couldn't find the chance.
[17:27] If you can't find time to study because of your job, then you can leave your job.
[17:33] Fulfill this desire of yours.
My preparation is almost done.
[17:38] But I don't know why I'm nervous.
[17:43] A brilliant person like you should get nervous.
[17:47] I'm sure that you will pass this exam, like how you'll pass every test that life throws your way.
[17:56] You trust me so much.
Of course.
[18:03] To tell you the truth, more than the exams I'm worried that auntie might not like it.
[18:10] Because if I manage to clear the CSS exams, I won't be able to give much time at home.
[18:16] No one can become a hurdle to your success. That I can promise you.
[18:38] Seeing the size of these books scares me.
[18:44] Good luck.
Thank you.
[20:04] Sure... it's final from our end. No, we have more stock than is required.
[20:10] Mahnoor.
[20:13] Sure... what figures do you have? Okay, thank you.
[20:21] What is it?
Look at what I brought you.
[20:26] What is it?
[20:35] What is this?
The registration of the exams has begun and the date has been announced,
[20:44] What are you thinking?
Aren't these dates very close by?
[20:48] Yes, but it's only a coincidence. They occur every time on those dates
[20:55] You still have more four months.
I'm ready but...
[21:00] At least try, even if you don't pass this year, you can try again next year.
[21:06] Right now fill out this form. Attach the required documents as well, so that I can submit them.
[21:12] Okay.
[21:14] Listen... what happened to mother's appointment.
About that, I got a message.
[21:20] The appointment is the day after tomorrow. Be sure to keep all of her reports.
[21:26] Alright fine... I'll leave work early today. I'll visit mother and then I'll come home. Is there any problem with that?
[22:14] Mother asked you for the papers a few days ago and you had the papers made so quickly.
[22:19] Will we keep running behind this issue endlessly?
[22:22] Besides, these are NOC papers that only state that auntie has no objections to selling this house.
[22:28] It will take a lot of time for this house to be sold. Auntie, please sign this.
[22:36] One here as well.
[22:39] Greetings*
[22:44] Come here.
[22:47] It's alright...
How are you?
[22:49] I'm fine.
How are you?
[22:52] How are you brother Saqlain? Sister Areeba how are you?
[22:55] I'm fine.
I'm fine as well. How are you and what's going on?
[23:01] I'm fine as well... nothing but sleep, and work.
[23:08] Your in-laws have burdened you greatly.
[23:13] They are very greedy people. They're making you work even after your marriage.
[23:17] I used to work a job even before my marriage.
[23:20] They never even discuss it.
Why would they?
[23:25] Everyone likes money coming in.
Besides, this is a personal matter, and I have no right to interfere.
[23:35] Take care, auntie. Until I come back, you have to take care of yourself.
[23:40] I'm giving you Areeba's responsibility as well.
Don't worry, my prayers are with you.
[23:48] That's good.
Farewell*
[23:53] Mother, I'll be back.
[23:59] Are you fine?
Much better.
[24:03] What kind of file did brother Saqlain have?
[24:07] They were NOC papers...
NOC?
[24:11] Mother asked him to sell the other home we have. He brought NOC papers for that and mother signed them as well.
[24:22] Mother, you sold that house and didn't even tell me about it.
[24:28] My dear, that house is in dire condition.
[24:31] The walls are crumbling. Before it falls I thought it was wise to sell it.
[24:48] I've had the papers signed, now I'm the owner.
[24:54] Handle everything quickly...
[24:58] And yes, the rate should be good.
It will be sir...
[25:03] But what if they expressed the desire to look at it?
[25:10] You know how people are.
For that, wait for my return.
[25:16] I will figure something out. But start finding people and pick a good rate.
[25:21] Don't worry sir... I will find them. Farewell.
[25:54] How's your mother feeling now?
She's better than before.
[26:02] I don't feel a difference between daughters and sons...
[26:07] but if one has a son, daughters need not run to their homes every day.
[26:16] That other sister you have...
[26:20] How much time has passed since her marriage?
Something like seven years...
[26:26] Seven years?
[26:30] And they still don't have a child? What's the problem?
[26:34] That's what God wishes.
[26:37] That is true, but there is always a reason...
[26:45] I mean some sort of problem.
I think she has a medical issue.
[26:51] Then why doesn't she have herself checked up by a doctor?
She is...
[26:56] After a few days, she has an appointment with a doctor as well.
[27:05] May God have mercy. May Faraz be blessed with a child.
[27:16] May God create ease for her as well.
[27:20] How I've yearned to see happiness in my home.
[27:29] Nowadays I can't seem to get well. My legs hurt, otherwise, I would have helped you out.
[27:38] I will go and rest. Aima has her paper as well, she's studying inside.
[27:44] No need for that, I'll take care of everything. Go and rest.
[28:31] Where's Mahnoor?
Kitchen.
[28:36] Faraz...
[28:41] He can't see his mother. He's always looking for his wife.
[29:18] May I?
[29:40] Did you have something for me?
[29:44] I did...
[29:47] But now I've forgotten it.
[29:54] What's for dinner?
Potatoes and eggplant.
[30:00] Potatoes and eggplant?
[30:05] I'll make the flatbreads and then we'll eat.
[30:23] Mahir...
Yes?
[30:29] What were you doing in Faraz's room?
[30:38] I went to meet him.
But he's not in his room, he's in the kitchen.
[30:48] Yes, I know that's why I came back to my room.
[30:55] What do you want with him?
[30:58] I'll tell brother about it.
I'm sure you must want to ask for money for your heavy bike.
[31:07] Yes!
Don't you dare ask him for money for such a useless thing!
[31:17] In this time of inflation, it has become hard to even manage the necessary expenses.
[31:22] And you want money for useless things.
[31:30] Is everything alright?
A friend of mine is selling his heavy bike. He's selling it at a low price.
[31:43] Brother if you don't have the money, it's fine, we can pay him in installments. He's a good friend of mine.
[31:49] Brother, it's my dream to own a heavy bike, please don't refuse.
[32:00] Sure, alright. Let me arrange for your fees first...
[32:06] After that, we'll take care of the bike.
[32:10] Thank you so much. I should get going.
[32:16] Faraz! By fulfilling his useless wishes you are spoiling him.
[32:23] It's his wish, who will fulfill it if I don't?
[32:32] Mother and I are going out today.
[32:37] We'll be back in a while.
[32:43] At this hour? It's time for supper.
[32:49] I know... 
[32:55] But I feel like eating out today.
[33:33] We didn't need to come out to eat, I would have eaten at home.
You complain that I don't share my problems with you.
[33:42] And you're hiding something from me.
I eat almost everything, I just don't like eating a few vegetables.
[33:53] You can't hide everything from me.
[33:58] But I do understand you. It would have been better if you had told me.
[34:07] I like ice cream a lot.
[34:12] Sure we'll eat that as well.
[34:17] Come on.
[35:03] Wait a minute, is this your heavy bike?
[35:08] Yes, it is...
[35:12] Anyways, how do I look riding it?
[35:18] You look like a hero. You look very handsome.
[35:23] I know.
[35:29] Will you go on a ride with me?
[35:32] On a ride? Why not?
[35:36] Come on.
[35:59] Twenty-five thousand.
Sure.
[36:11] I thought I'd kept more.
[36:15] Here you go.
[36:18] Here's your bill.
Thank you.
[36:22] Go inside opd three, you'll find the doctor there.
Thank you.
[36:45] That's strange, Mahnoor.
[36:49] Mother's doctor added this medicine after looking at her report. How can this doctor advise surgery?
[36:59] Sister Areeba this doctor is very senior and very experienced.
[37:04] He's our consultant senior, and on top of that, he's a specialist as well. After seeing these reports he said...
[37:12] that it would be wise to do the surgery as soon as possible. Because there is no other option apart from surgery.
[37:20] I think if you aren't satisfied you should come with us.
[37:27] We can make an appointment with auntie's consultant again.
[37:31] Faraz, it's not about if I'm satisfied or not. Saqlain knows all about mother's medical history.
[37:38] And he's the one who has always taken mother to the hospital.
[37:46] I'm sure that Saqlain must have satisfied himself. Apart from that mother has been well since that day.
[37:54] I don't know why you don't understand that these medicines are only helping her temporarily.
[38:01] This is having no effect on her health. That's why she's having trouble breathing.
[38:08] Look Mahnoor... doing a bypass on mother is a big decision.
[38:13] Saqlain is not here.
[38:16] So... we should not take any decision right now.
[38:28] Alright then, we'll wait for brother Saqlain. Until then we can make up our minds, as well as auntieâ€™s.
[38:40] There's no emergency. This surgery can be planned as well.
[38:46] But we don't know when brother Saqlain...
[38:52] What is the matter? Why did you get so quiet?
[39:06] Is it something that you guys are hiding from me?
[39:12] Faraz, is everything alright?
Yes, it is, please have a seat.
[39:24] Why do they seem worried to me?
Auntie, actually...
[39:30] they are still worried because of how you got unwell that day.
[39:38] I'm just telling them that you're fine now and there's nothing to worry about.
He's right. I'm completely fine.
[39:46] Don't worry.
