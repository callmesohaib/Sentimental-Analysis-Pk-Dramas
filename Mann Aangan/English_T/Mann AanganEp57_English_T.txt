[01:22] has sister got to know that brother Saqlain... 
[01:27] what did she get to know?
[01:31] I saw him in the mall with a girl, who seems to be of 22 to 23 years old
[02:04] what!
[02:05] yes
[02:06] and they were walking in such a manner as if she was his wife
[02:11] as if he knows her since so long
[02:19] what are you saying? You must be having a misunderstanding. Brother Saqlain... 
[02:23] sister Areeba
sister!
[02:25] sister, what happened to you?
Go bring water
[02:28] sister Areeba, control yourself
[02:31] Ramsha, quickly bring water
sister Areeba?
[02:34] sister, what happen to you?
[02:38] bring water
[02:43] are you in your senses? Haven't you gone mad?
[02:46] what happen, what have I done?
[02:48] what was the need to tell this in front of sister? Couldn't we discuss it privately?
[02:52] Why?
[02:53] Sister should know that brother Saqlain has betrayed her, and still betraying her
[02:58] close your mouth!
[03:00] sister, there isn't any such thing. 
[03:03] Don't know whom she saw & said that brother Saqlain... 
[03:06] brother Saqlain cannot be with some woman
[03:11] sister, please don't cry. Please control yourself
[03:18] please don't cry
[03:21] sister, please don't cry. Nothing as such will happen
[03:31] sister... 
[03:34] Sister... Sister!
[03:48] sister Areeba, what are you searching for?
[03:55] look at this
[03:57] what is this?
[03:58] its the same necklace that Saqlain had gifted me
[04:05] yes, so?
[04:06] the robbers had snatched it from me, I had told you on call
[04:12] do you remember?
[04:13] yes yes, I do remember. How can I forget it but this... 
[04:18] how come you got it?
[04:21] I found it today from my house cupboard
[04:30] from your house cupboard?
[04:32] don't know it was hidden in the clothes, as soon as I took out the clothes
[04:37] it fell on the ground
[04:39] who will hide it in the clothes?
[04:42] sister, maybe those people have hid it there
[04:47] No, no... 
[04:49] those robbers took away this necklace
[04:53] I had asked them for it, but they didn't give me & then they left
[05:00] I mean, if this is the case then how come it came here?
[05:05] that's what I am thinking!
[05:08] I haven't gone home since mother's death. The house is closed
[05:12] only Saqlain goes there
[05:17] So... has brother Saqlain kept it there?
[05:29] I had asked him not to keep this amount at home
[05:33] but still he had kept that amount inside the house
[05:39] do you know, this necklace was gone uselessly
[05:43] it means, brother Saqlain had sent the robbers inside the house
[05:50] what non-sense you are blurting? Be quiet!
[05:57] let her speak whatever she is saying
[06:03] I was trying to match the incidents since so long
[06:07] and I was getting confused
[06:13] how does that girl look, whom you saw with Saqlain
[06:22] sister, by looks she seems to be of 22 to 23 years but she seems to be very clever & sly
[06:28] it seems as if she is such a sly woman and.. 
[06:31] I saw them, I saw brother Saqlain was doing shopping with her and... 
[06:35] she was so close to brother Saqlain
[06:38] Ramsha,.... Ramsha can have a misunderstanding as well, sister
[06:42] No
[06:45] Ramsha isn't having any misunderstanding
[06:49] She must have seen Saqlain with that girl
[06:55] how can you say this?
[06:59] I agree that brother Saqlain has been doing fraud about the money with us since beginning
[07:04] and do you know, our shop wasn't sold in 50 lacs. It got sold in a lot more amount
[07:09] and I had told this matter to mom
[07:12] but mom had stopped me by saying that.. 
[07:15] its the matter of your marriage & happiness
[07:21] I was so blind
[07:29] I kept blaming others for breaking my house
[07:39] but my house..
[07:42] it was never mine... 
[08:00] Mahnoor, do you know
[08:03] sometime ago a girl came to our house
[08:07] she said, I am Saqlain's wife
[08:19] what!
[08:22] then?
[08:24] then Saqlain came & he ousted that girl from our house and said that she is telling a lie
[08:31] but she wasn't lying, she was telling the truth
[08:42] sister Areeba, please control yourself. A lot had happened, then why didn't you tell me?
[08:47] I had told you
[08:50] I had told you that Saqlain have changed
[08:54] his behavior is not good with me
[09:09] Areeba
[09:14] sister, brother Saqlain has come outside
[09:19] she must be upstairs
[09:28] wait sister Areeba
[09:30] you won't say anything to brother Saqlain right now
[09:32] but why? I want to talk to him
[09:35] No! there is no use of talking to him as we don't have any proof. He'll deny once again
[09:45] but this?
[09:46] this is nothing. Let us satisfy ourselves that all of this is true 
[09:50] talking without proof is just fighting nothing else!
[09:55] we don't have any proof
[09:57] but we have this necklace that... 
No!
[10:00] keep it back right now
[10:03] please
[10:18] gather yourself, come
[10:57] oh wow!
[10:59] everyone is here
[11:06] Mahnoor, I had got to know about your arrival as I saw your car outside
[11:10] but Ramsha
[11:12] I didn't know about you
[11:20] greetings!
[11:22] greetings to you too!
[11:25] is your anger over or not?
[11:29] because when you had gone from here, it felt as if you had ended all your relations
[11:35] brother Saqlain, blood relations aren't so weak
[11:39] distances can occur in the relations because of anger & fights
[11:45] but relations cannot break
[11:50] right
[11:54] what happened to you? What have you done to yourself?
[11:56] were you crying?
[11:58] No
[12:02] I know both of your sisters doesn't care about you a bit
[12:07] absolutely correct!
[12:09] We were unaware from sister Areeba's side, because we had thought that you take very good care of her
[12:20] who else will take care of her if I won't?
[12:23] look at her condition
[12:25] She looks sick
[12:36] maybe you haven't noticed
[12:39] how you would have noticed, as you haven't come home since yesterday
[12:43] there is no need to give me lecture
[12:48] I wasn't doing an outing, I was out for work
[12:51] I had a few meetings in Hyderabad
[12:57] Also, I had informed her. I had dropped her a message, hadn't I?
[13:00] yes, he did
[13:06] brother Saqlain, when you were aware that sister Areeba is not well. Then what was the need for you to go to Hyderabad?
[13:17] you could have taken her to the doctor, right?
[13:19] is everything alright? Now you have started to give me suggestions too
[13:24] first tell me, did you come here after seeking permission from brother Toqeer or not?
[13:31] permission?
[13:33] Ramsha doesn't need to seek anyone's permission to meet her sisters
[13:37] she isn't a slave but Toqeer's wife
[13:41] in fact, she must have informed Toqeer before coming here. Right Ramsha?
[13:46] yes absolutely! I came here after seeking Toqeer's permission
[13:51] in fact, the driver had dropped me here
[14:01] are you listening to your sisters?
[14:03] I think both of them have started to comfort each other once again
[14:08] already she has humiliated us a lot, and now again she is trying to do something inappropriate
[14:18] I'm telling you Areeba
[14:21] it won't be good if my head bends down in front of brother Toqeer
[14:24] brother Saqlain, why do you blackmail sister Areeba on every other matter?
[14:33] I black mail her?
[14:35] yes! why do you taunt her on every matter?
[14:39] what has she done, tell me
what as such sin she has committed?
[14:45] Mahnoor, go away from here. Ramsha, you also go
[14:49] No, why are you sending them?
[14:51] they should also get to hear about their doings
[14:54] listen to me
[14:57] all of a sudden, your missing ex-lover becomes alive
[15:20] this poor girl can met him after betraying her husband
[15:24] but she doesn't have an idea that this matter cannot stay hidden from us
[15:33] what is going on?
[15:35] what are you & Wasay trying to do?
[15:38] I am not having any affair with Wasay and you... 
[15:45] it means, you had sent Wasay to my office
[15:50] he came here!
[15:57] had you sent Wasay to Mahnoor's office? but you had told me that.. 
[16:02] what else I could have done?
[16:05] if her ex-lover will come to ask about Mahnoor on our door
[16:10] then what I should do? The neighbors will ask us question, what is he doing here
[16:14] what I could have done?
[16:16] don't you worry about the neighbors
[16:18] because the neighbors gets to know every single thing every time because of you
[16:24] it doesn't matter if they ask or not
[16:34] sister Areeba, if I had been meeting Wasay
[16:39] then he wouldn't have come to my office
[16:41] brother Saqlain had sent Wasay to my office
[16:44] so that Faraz shall see him, and a new storm shall come into my life
[16:48] anyways... 
[16:52] take care of yourself
[16:55] and now stay very carefully
[17:00] We are leaving
[17:08] Ramsha, shall we leave?
[17:09] yes... let's go
[17:11] *farewell*
[17:17] Mahnoor
[17:17] let her go
[17:23] its better for her to leave from here
[17:26] its difficult to look into one's eyes when one have a guilt feeling
[18:40] where is Mahnoor?
[18:42] Umm... sir, she has gone outside
[18:45] where has she gone? I mean, did she tell before leaving?
[18:47] No sir, I saw her going out of the office
[18:51] She was in a bit hurry
[18:53] Okay, do let me know when she comes back
[18:57] Okay
[18:58] in fact, keep this file
[19:01] get her signatures done & submit it in the finance department
[19:04] Ok sir, I will get it signed
[19:08] where she must have gone at this hour!
[19:25] I have made such a big mistake
[19:28] I shouldn't have taken a drop from Wasay
[19:31] for how many mistakes you'll regret?
[19:33] Ramsha!
[19:34] you got me married forcefully
[19:37] I agree that you don't like Maheer, then you shouldn't have got me married to him
[19:42] but at least, you shouldn't have done this to me
[19:49] I know sister Areeba thinks by brother Saqlain's brain
[19:54] but sister, how come you've let this happen with me?
[20:00] are you happy with Toqeer? Does he... 
[20:03] Do you know... 
[20:06] I feel scared whenever he comes near me
[20:10] what are you saying?
[20:12] he is your husband
[20:14] why are you scared of him?
[20:15] I don't know
[20:18] Ramsha, forget Maheer
[20:21] he was not in your fate and... 
[20:26] I am understanding your situation
[20:31] even my heart wasn't satisfied
[20:35] but maybe all our assumptions are wrong
[20:40] apparently he... 
he is brother Saqlain's friend
[20:43] somehow he must be like brother Saqlain
[20:49] brother Saqlain is such a big fraudster!
[20:52] which fraud he hadn't done with us? Also, he is betraying sister Areeba as well
[20:58] and now I think that your allegation was also true
[21:04] maybe he had added the poison in moms medicines
[21:08] and today... 
[21:09] today the poison brother Saqlain has added in mine & Faraz's life
[21:14] it will kill me as it is
[21:17] don't know what benefit he'll take now after marrying me to Toqeer
[21:22] because he doesn't do any work without benefit
[21:26] don't know what advantage will he get by doing all this
[21:31] sit inside the car
[21:55] hello!
[21:57] how are you brother Toqeer?
[22:00] I'm absolutely fine
[22:02] tell me about yourself, where are you doing outings?
[22:05] you are quite busy in doing outings
[22:06] where will I go for outings? The work is keeping me occupied day & night
[22:12] yes I know your office work
[22:17] Ok listen Ramsha...
brother Toqeer, I am sorry to interrupt you
[22:24] Ramsha came here to meet Mahnoor & Areeba
[22:30] did she came here with your permission?
[22:33] yes, I had asked her to go there
[22:39] I thought maybe her mood will get better
[22:42] She keeps crying at home at all times
[22:45] brother Toqeer, I had asked you to treat her strictly
[22:50] and listen! you have to stop Ramsha's meeting with Mahnoor
[22:55] you'll be worried if she gets a free hand
[22:58] yes, I will see that
[23:02] you tell me, what's the update about my work
[23:04] your work is getting done. Just send the money, God willing tomorrow you'll get the money
[23:11] Okay, let me get you money transferred
[23:14] Okay brother Toqeer, tomorrow I will come to see you
[23:18] We also have to do the planning of our new factory
[23:21] Sure, see you!
[23:28] why both of them came here? Areeba's mood is also off
[23:32] what's the matter!
[23:41] you won't say anything to brother Saqlain right now
[23:43] there is no use of talking to him as we don't have any proof. He'll deny once again
[23:48] Let us satisfy ourselves that all of this is true
[23:51] talking without proof is just fighting nothing else!
[23:55] we don't have any proof
[24:04] did you see, how she got furious!
[24:07] she is having an extra marital affair secretly
[24:11] that's why I had send Wasay to Faraz
[24:14] so that he can tell her how secretly his wife is betraying him
[24:21] time will tell us who is betraying whom
[24:26] the secret will be exposed soon
[24:31] that who is betraying their life partner
[24:37] what do you mean?
[24:41] nothing
[24:45] are you fine?
[24:48] yes, I am fine
[24:50] No, I don't find you fine. I think we should go to the doctor
[24:54] No, there is no need of it. I'm fine
you are so stubborn
[24:58] first, you got me scolded from your sisters that I don't take care of you
[25:01] shall I go & tell them that you don't listen to me?
[25:04] lets go to the doctor, go & get ready if you want to then we'll go. Its important
[25:08] I wish, I hadn't seen the other face hidden behind this face
[25:13] then today, I would have felt proud on my fate like before after listening to your few words of love
[25:20] but today... 
[25:38] don't know what brain washing both of them did of Areeba
[25:42] foolish woman!
[26:02] how dare she!
[26:06] she left the house without informing me
[26:17] take out my car
[26:46] keep this amount
[26:48] the contractor had asked for the money from me, so I got them from the bank
[26:52] after that he went out of the city for a week
[26:54] anyways, keep them safely as they are 25 lacs
[27:01] kindly deposit this amount in the bank
[27:04] you can withdraw them whenever you want to use them
[27:08] I am feeling so tensed
[27:11] what do you think, would it be safe to deposit & with draw the money again & again?
[27:16] first withdraw the money & then deposit them and then withdraw again to give it to the contractor
[27:22] its a matter of a few days
[27:24] Well give him the money whenever he'll come back. Besides, they money is safe inside the house. So why are you worried?
[27:37] where is the money?
[27:38] inside my purse
[27:40] not these, what about those 25 lacs!
[27:58] what are you saying?
[28:00] I had told you that I'm in Hyderabad office. I'm sitting in a meeting
[28:04] maybe you are having a misunderstanding
[28:41] who can add poison in mom's medicines?
[28:43] its obvious! the person who used to bring medicine for her must have added poison to them
[28:49] but mom's medicines...
[28:52]  I see...
[28:54] so this is the conspiracy against me conspiracy?
[28:56] you did a conspiracy to kill my mother by adding poison to her medicines
[29:00] and there is no doubt that you used to bring her medicines
[30:30] come Areeba
[30:42] tell me something doctor, what happened to Areeba?
[30:44] let me get her few tests done, then I'll confirm you
[30:48] tests? Is everything alright
[30:51] yes yes, I hope that everything is fine
[30:57] what's the matter, Areeba?
[30:59] you seem quite upset
[31:01] also very stressed & sad
[31:07] is everything okay in between you both?
[31:09] yes, everything is perfectly fine
[31:13] she wasn't feeling well & I was worried, so I have brought her to you
[31:16] by the way, everything is fine between us. Tell her Areeba
[31:20] everything is fine
[31:22] Okay
[31:25] I'm prescribing a few tests. kindly show me the reports soon
[31:30] Okay
[31:33] Excuse me, let me go & check the call
[31:38] hello!
[31:46] Areeba
[31:48] are you fine?
[31:51] you will tell me this
[31:55] I don't want to say anything right now, let it get confirm first
[31:59] maybe there is a good news for you
[32:05] what kind of good news, doctor?'
[32:07] you are expecting
[32:16] do you know aunt Erum usually ask me to..
[32:20] do second marriage
[32:25] you are so courage my child, hats off to your strength
[32:31] that you've kept their infertile daughter
[32:36] what!
[32:41] yes! get these tests done. I will call you myself after checking these reports
[32:54] are you telling the truth?
[32:56] my assumption cannot be wrong
[33:00] I can understand that its a very big news for you
[33:03] that's why I haven't shared it with your husband as of yet
[33:06] the reports will come within a few hours & then I will confirm you
[33:11] just take very good care of yourself & be careful
[33:18] yes...
[33:21] I will take very good care of myself
[33:24] very much..
[33:26] thank you!
[33:29] thank you so much!
[33:38] try to understand, a few matters are very important
[33:45] Okay I'll talk to you later, Fariya
[34:04] I'm Fariya, Saqlain's wife
[34:08] Areeba, do you remember I had told you that a woman came in front of my car accidentally
[34:13] I had helped her in humanity by giving her some money so that it doesn't become a police case
[34:18] and don't know from where she got my office & home address. Now she came here to black mail me
[34:31] I've brought Areeba to the hospital as she is not well
[34:37] yes, just now I came back from your house. How can I come back again?
[34:50] Ok fine, I'll try to come
[34:53] I will try to come to your house after dropping Areeba home from the hospital. Happy?
[35:01] I have told you that I cannot come right now
[35:04] don't annoy me by calling again & again
[35:10] I've kept such a useless staff in my office
[35:16] what did the doctor say?
[35:17] she had asked me to get a few tests done
[35:21] Okay come, lets go to the laboratory
[35:41] greetings!
[35:44] what happen to you?
[35:46] Nothing!
[35:52] there is something
[35:53] your face looks so gloomy
[35:56] see Faraz, she looks a bit worried. 
is everything fine, my dear?
[36:01] yes aunty, everything is fine
[36:03] let me go & freshen up
[36:11] Faraz
[36:13] did you guys had a fight?
[36:16] why will I fight with her & that too on which topic?
[36:19] true that! You hardly fight with anyone, my child
[36:24] maybe there is no one in this world who favors her so much
[36:37] even after that, somebody betrays you or hides the truth
[36:41] then how hurt one feels
[36:50] I met two three estate agents and all of them said that our shop isn't sold on a less price but on the correct market value
[36:56] but what did brother Saqlain said?
that the shop got sold in less price
[37:01] Oh well. Even after knowing everything what can we do? Nothing!
[37:06] We have to be quiet, because the problem is sister Areeba's marriage
[37:09] and we'll stay quiet
[37:17] Maybe you are forgetting that he is not your servant but my husband
[37:23] and you all are not his responsibility
[37:26] He does all this because you are my family. He does everything for my happiness
[37:32] and you!
[37:34] you want to ruin my marriage!
[37:43] sister Areeba is right, I shouldn't have told you anything from the start
[37:48] if I would have told everything to mom or brother Saqlain, then I wouldn't have been blamed for this along with you
[37:54] I used to think so bad for brother Saqlain for no reason, as he cannot think good about us or favor us
[38:01] but... that poor guy was fighting with everyone for us
[38:14] mom & sister Areeba, what's the benefit of giving so much of importance to that person for so many years
[38:19] and he had been adding poison in our lives
[38:22] he kept on playing with our lives as we were puppets
[38:29] I wish, I could take stand for Ramsha today
[38:32] but I cannot do anything
[38:36] don't know how sister Areeba would be?
[38:39] Let me call her
