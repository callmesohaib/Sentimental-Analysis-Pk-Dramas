[01:21] Come Ramsha
[01:23] Have dinner with us.
[01:31] Take it
[01:33] Thanks
[01:44] Have it Ramsha.
[01:47] Hmm
[02:08] How is food brother Toqeer?
[02:11] Hmm
[02:12] Hmm
[02:14] It's very delicious.
[02:17] The food is delicious, sister.
[02:21] Thanks
[02:42] No matter what relationship I have with Aima, but she is your daughter.
[02:46] Do you want Aima to live all his live in such a relation where neither she gets love nor respect.
[02:54] Rather, she was humiliated jokingly and she silently bear that.
[03:20] Faraz
[03:22] Hmm
[03:24] Whatever you will discuss with Yasir
[03:27] Do it very calmly and patiently.
[03:36] It's obvious.
[03:38] I am not inviting here to fight.
[03:41] I want the same thing that nothing goes wrong which cause any fight.
[03:50] Neither Aima has told you this nor Aunt.
[03:54] If anything goes wrong then everyone will feel that I...
[03:57] Don't worry.
[03:59] I have no intention to say anything harsh to him.
[04:01] Nor I am so foolish.
[04:04] I will discuss everything calmly
[04:08] OK
[04:11] You have your exam day after tomorrow.
[04:16] Yes
[04:17] You know but you are not revising.
[04:20] I have made all preparation which I could.
[04:23] I feel that
[04:25] We shouldn't study more just before exam instead we should prepare much earlier.
[04:32] OK
[04:33] But God willing you will definitely succeed.
[04:36] God willing.
[04:59] How is your tour going on and how do you find our city, brother Toqeer?
[05:08] It's like that.
[05:10] Anyways, if you need anything, don't hesitate and call me immediately.
[05:18] Yes of course.
[05:19] We will meet soon.
[05:20] Please inform me.
[05:24] Of course
[05:25] Bye
[05:30] Listen
[05:32] Look at this.
[05:33] Mr. Toqeer gave this gift to me.
[05:35] I didn't open last night. I just opened it, it seems very expensive.
[05:41] Brother Toqeer has a big heart.
[05:44] He is very close to me and trusts me a lot.
[05:48] He gives millions of rupees blindly without even asking the reason.
[05:53] He didn't even lost a single rupee.
[05:57] I am sure
[05:59] You can never betray a trust.
[06:05] I like this gift.
[06:07] Yes it is good.
[06:10] Sister Ariba
[06:11] Bye
[06:13] Bye
[06:15] Bye, brother Saqlain.
[06:17] Bye
[06:24] I am just coming.
[06:32] Ramsha listen to me.
[06:40] Yes
[06:41] You told Ariba that you need pocket money.
[06:46] Yes I need pocket money.
[06:48] You should have told me.
[06:50] I got busy in my work and didn't pay attention to give you some amount.
[06:56] Take it.
[06:59] Check whether you need more then I will give you.
[07:03] No
[07:04] It's enough.
[07:05] Thank you.
[07:09] OK, tell me if you need money.
[07:15] Now go, your van driver is anxiously ringing the horn.
[07:18] He will disturb whole neighborhood for no reason.
[07:20] OK bye.
[07:21] Go
[07:41] I want to talk to you.
[07:43] Yes go ahead
[07:47] I don't know why but I feel that we should arrange Ramsha's marriage.
[07:55] Is there everything OK?
[07:57] Yes, everything is fine.
[08:00] Ramsha is indeed a great responsibility for us. 
[08:04] Taking care of her till her studies completion
[08:08] Look
[08:09] We are living here because of her instead of living in our house.
[08:15] I am not living for myself anymore.
[08:18] I am worried about Ramsha all the time.
[08:21] And my treatment has also stopped.
[08:23] After mom's departure, so many problems arise.
[08:28] If I live with these tensions.
[08:31] How will I be treated?
[08:36] Is this what you really wanted to talk about, Ariba?
[08:38] Or is there something done wrong by Ramsha which you are trying to hide from me.
[08:45] Because Mahnoor came yesterday and was fighting with Ramsha.
[08:49] And Ramsha almost about to scratch her hairs.
[08:52] Is everything OK?
[08:56] There is no such thing.
[09:00] I don't know why they were fighting with each other.
[09:05] I don't have a discussion with Mahnoor.
[09:10] She has misbehaved with you so much.
[09:13] I don't like at all that she misbehaves with you.
[09:17] Hey what happened? She is your sister.
[09:21] That day you were begging me to forgive her then what happened now?
[09:25] I want you to forgive her and
[09:30] And end any bitterness between both of you..
[09:35] Listen
[09:36] Ramsha is not only our responsibility.
[09:40] And Mahnoor will meet her outside home.
[09:43] And God forbid.
[09:46] If anything goes wrong.
[09:48] Then I will be held responsible that I didn't monitor Ramsha properly.
[09:53] Ariba, you know your sisters better than me.
[09:57] It doesn't matter whether you monitor Ramsha or not.
[10:04] But
[10:06] Ramsha is under Mahnoor's influence.
[10:09] And I am sure that she is not less than Mahnoor.
[10:12] Time will reveal this secret.
[10:23] You have become more worried than me.
[10:28] What else can I do?
[10:30] A gentleman is afraid of disgrace and shame.
[10:36] Anyways
[10:39] We will think about it when time comes.
[10:41] No need to worry at the moment.
[10:44] And don't worry, Everything will be better.
[10:49] I will put it in cupboard.
[10:50] Hmm
[10:51] Your tea must also get cold.
[10:53] Let me make fresh tea.
[10:56] OK
[10:59] How long will Mahnoor cover it up?
[11:02] And Faraz is the mastermind.
[11:06] First he married Mahnoor.
[11:08] On the other hand he asked his brother to follow Ramsha.
[11:12] It means that two sisters in one house.
[11:15] What a plan?
[11:20] But I won't let that happen at any cost.
[11:24] Mahnoor doesn't want this to happen.
[11:28] That's why they were fighting.
[11:31] This shouldn't end.
[11:36] Then
[11:38] What should I do?
[12:05] How is everyone at home?
[12:07] Everyone is fine.
[12:09] Good.
[12:10] And
[12:12] When will your father come back to Pakistan?
[12:17] His plan is for next month.
[12:19] I see.
[12:28] You have invited me especially?
[12:31] Mom told me that you want to have a meeting with me.
[12:35] Yes
[12:38] Are you angry with us?
[12:41] No
[12:47] Mom called you three of four times but you didn't receive. I also called you but you didn't receive my call.
[12:53] Then mom sent text message to your mother.
[12:56] All this shows that you are angry with us for some reason.
[13:01] I am not angry with you brother Faraz.
[13:03] Then are you angry with Aima?
[13:05] Because I have heard that
[13:09] You and Aima talk less and fight more.
[13:19] I don't have a quarrelsome nature.
[13:22] But if someone doesn't understand my point then I get irritated.
[13:25] And Aima is very stupid in this matter.
[13:28] Actually she is a bit dumb.
[13:30] She takes time to understand.
[13:46] Aima is your fiance.
[13:49] You are about to get married in few days.
[13:51] And using such words for your future life partner is not a good thing to do.
[14:08] You and Aima should give respect to each other.
[14:12] A relationship in which there is no respect is completely hollow and weak.
[14:18] You have given me such a long lecture brother Faraz.
[14:21] I am sorry if you feel bad that I called you sister stupid.
[14:25] I was just joking.
[14:35] Exactly.
[14:37] I was thinking the same way that it was just a joke.
[14:41] Anyway, leave this topic.
[14:44] Yes Aunt.
[14:46] Tell me what is your favorite dish? I will cook that for you.
[14:51] Anything special made by Aima.
[15:18] Yes
[15:23] Hey
[15:25] How are you brother Toqeer?
[15:28] So early in the mornging.
[15:30] How are you?
[15:31] I am fine.
[15:32] Please have a seat.
[15:33] Thank you.
[15:36] Why did you bother to come here? If you told me, I would have come.
[15:39] I want something.
[15:41] That's why I came here.
[15:44] The thirsty will go to the well, but the well will not come to the thirsty.
[15:50] You need something from me. Order me.
[15:54] Saqlain, you are like a brother to me.
[15:58] This is your greatness.
[16:00] Thanks a lot.
[16:03] You reminded me regarding factory that day, otherwise I forgot that project.
[16:08] But you mentioned that so I thought about starting a new project.
[16:13] But I am really busy.
[16:17] You don't have to worry about that. I am here with you.
[16:21] Yes
[16:22] You are always with me.
[16:25] Rather, I was thinking of making you my partner in the new factory.
[16:31] Brother Toqeer, who can I become your partner?
[16:34] Why not?
[16:36] We will work together.
[16:38] Do you accept?
[16:41] Yes, of course.
[16:43] It would be an honor for me to work as a partner with you.
[16:48] Thank you so much.
[16:54] I am sorry, I haven't asked you whether you will take coffee or tea?
[17:00] Coffee would be nice.
[17:01] Sure
[17:05] Send two really good coffees in my room quickly.
[17:09] Immediately.
[17:13] Brother Toqeer, kindly tell me how much will be the budget of the factory?
[17:17] Why are you worried about the budget?
[17:20] I will invest the whole amount.
[17:25] That's fine.
[17:27] But
[17:29] But you will have to give me a favor.
[17:33] Order me brother Toqeer.
[17:37] Your sister in law
[17:40] What is her name?
[17:43] Ramsha
[17:44] She is so cute.
[17:49] Ramsha is younger sister of my wife, brother Toqeer.
[17:53] Please don't think anything wrong about her.
[17:55] No, no.
[17:57] I am not thinking bad.
[18:01] I want to marry her.
[18:05] You want to marry Ramsha?
[18:12] But she is too young and
[18:17] I don't think her sisters will agree with this proposal otherwise
[18:21] I have no objection with this proposal.
[18:24] So, convince them.
[18:27] Convince them.
[18:29] Brother
[18:31] I am offering you partnership in my new factory.
[18:34] You will have to do that much for me.
[18:42] The deal is not bad.
[18:45] Tell me if you accept this.
[18:50] Done?
[18:53] Done.
[18:55] Hundred percent.
[18:58] Just give me some days.
[19:06] OK
[19:25] Hi Faria.
[19:28] What's up Rameez.
[19:30] Where are you Faria?
[19:32] Neither you are receiving my phone nor your are meeting with me.
[19:35] I came to your home but Aunt said to me...
[19:37] I have told you that Saqlain knows everything.
[19:40] How did he know?
[19:42] It was my mistake.
[19:43] He heard me while I was talking to you on phone.
[19:49] How would I tell you what happened to me?
[19:52] Didn't he beat you?
[19:54] He has beaten me so much.
[19:56] But I told him.
[19:57] That it's enough. Give me divorce.
[20:01] But that bad man is sticking on his stance that he will not divorce me.
[20:04] What will we do Faria?
[20:07] Both of us.
[20:07] Wait for some time Rameez.
[20:10] I am thinking about taking divorce from court.
[20:14] I can't do anything as I have nothing at the moment.
[20:17] What about the amount which he gave you for business?
[20:19] He took that amount back.
[20:22] Oh
[20:24] And he is planning to grab you as well.
[20:26] He will file a case against you for stealing his money and get you arrested by police.
[20:30] What?
[20:33] How can he file a false case against me, Faria?
[20:36] Saqlain can do anything Rameez, you don't know him.
[20:40] He is very sharp and cunning.
[20:43] Why don't you do one thing?
[20:44] Leave this city and go somewhere else for few days.
[20:48] But where?
[20:49] Rameez, go anywhere.
[20:51] You don't know he is very sharp and cunning and he will trap you and
[20:55] police will arrest you, why don't you understand?
[20:59] Listen
[21:01] We will keep be in contact.
[21:03] As soon as I get free from Saqlain, I will come to you.
[21:08] But please leave this city now.
[21:12] It would be best for you.
[21:14] OK fine
[21:17] Let me do this.
[21:19] Take care of yourself.
[21:21] And stay in contact with me.
[21:24] OK
[21:25] Bye
[21:34] What happened? Why are you laughing?
[21:36] Oh my God.
[21:37] He is still a stupid.
[21:39] He agrees without hesitation whatever I say.
[21:43] I am having ache in my abdomen due to laughing.
[21:47] Well tell me.
[21:48] Have you asked him to run away?
[21:50] He has run away.
[21:52] What next?
[21:55] I have planned for future.
[22:35] Toqeer takes decision very quickly. 
[22:40] I got an idea from his behavior yesterday.
[22:43] His offer is not bad.
[22:46] With his support I can get ownership of both properties of Ramsha.
[22:51] Toqeer won't have any interest in that.
[22:54] But it can be.
[22:58] Ramsha won't agree.
[23:00] It is not easy to convince Ariba and Mahnoor as well.
[23:17] Wait here, I am just coming.
[23:49] Here is your phone.
[24:00] Has this been repaired?
[24:01] I told you that you will get your phone today.
[24:04] So you got it.
[24:05] Thank you so much.
[24:07] Welcome.
[24:08] Shall we go?
[24:10] Let's go.
[24:11] Wait, let me start the bike.
[24:37] Do you think mom that Yasir is a perfect person for Aima?
[24:40] Yes
[24:41] What's wrong with him?
[24:43] He earns well and belongs to a well off family.
[24:49] But he should have manners as well.
[24:51] He was insulting my sister in front of me.
[24:54] Oh
[24:55] All of you have stuck on same point.
[24:58] You have advised Yasir.
[25:00] I firmly believe.
[25:02] That he must have understood the meaning and purpose of your words.
[25:05] Didn't you see how apologetically he said that he was joking.
[25:12] Faraz
[25:13] I think Aunt is right.
[25:16] I think brother Yasir has understood this.
[25:19] We didn't really like his way of talking with Aima.
[25:23] And did you see his behavior?
[25:25] How decently he was talking to Aima.
[25:27] I think we should leave this and move forward by forgetting it.
[25:32] Mahnoor is absolutely right.
[25:35] Let's leave this topic.
[25:37] Rather I was thinking about
[25:40] going to his house within next week or so and discuss regarding fixing marriage.
[25:46] The longer the delay, the more misunderstandings will increase.
[25:51] Some time this delay proves to be God's blessing for man.
[25:55] The personalities that are not exposed in a short time are exposed due to delay.
[26:04] Anyway, I am not satisfied.
[26:07] I was confused from the start but now I am sure.
[26:25] Are you OK?
[26:27] All good? Is everything fine?
[26:31] Sister Mahnoor came to our house yesterday.
[26:33] She scolded me so much that I can't tell you.
[26:38] You were saying that brother Faraz didn't ask you anything.
[26:42] Sister Mahnoor told me that she has fought with brother Faraz because of me.
[26:47] Hey
[26:49] He is like that.
[26:51] You know broher Faraz.
[26:53] He is a gentle and spiritual guy.
[26:57] But
[26:58] But sorry to say you sister is so clever.
[27:02] She is your sister but
[27:03] What is true is true.
[27:13] Didn't you see that how did she embarrassed my by hiding ring? 
[27:20] And brother Faraz were considering me as a liar.
[27:22] He accused me of theft.
[27:24] He searched me.
[27:33] But what can I do?
[27:35] She is being doing all this.
[27:39] Brother Faraz didn't say anything to me initially.
[27:43] But when sister in law told a lie against me then
[27:48] Brother Faraz got angry with me.
[27:50] Mom also got to know.
[27:52] But by doing so she has provided me an advantage.
[27:56] I didn't had to tell anything about you to anybody.
[28:01] Sister in law told that.
[28:03] And my problem got solved automatically.
[28:06] Now everybody knows.
[28:07] That I love you and want to marry you.
[28:13] Really?
[28:14] Hmm
[28:21] And I have told sister clearly.
[28:26] That there is no need for you to dictate me.
[28:29] I mean it's my life so I will live it as I wish.
[28:31] Good.
[28:32] Hmm
[28:33] It's your life so live it as you wish.
[28:36] There is no need to be afraid of anyone..
[28:39] I am wth you.
[28:42] But I am very afraid of brother Saqlain.
[28:45] Thank God that sister didn't tell anything to brother Saqlain yesterday.
[28:49] Otherwise, I would...
[28:52] Earlier you were afraid of sister.
[28:53] And now you are afraid of brother Saqlain.
[28:55] How did it came between both of us?
[28:58] Let's do one thing.
[29:01] We should run away.
[29:07] We should run away?
[29:10] Where and how?
[29:11] There are so many places.
[29:14] We will get married after we run away.
[29:16] Then we will return home, Nobody will say anything. That's it. It's simple.
[29:21] Ramsha, there is no need to think about anything. We are running away. That's it. OK?
[29:25] Really?
[29:28] So you are making this plan.
[29:33] Brother Saqlain.
[29:34] So this is happening instead of university.
[29:37] Listen to me.
[29:38] Shut up.
[29:42] Don't say a single word.
[29:51] Go with me, I don't want to create any drama in front of everyone here.
[30:02] Let's go.
[30:07] And listen.
[30:11] Let me see you in my spare time.
[30:14] Right?
[30:15] Now see.
[31:41] Come out.
[31:43] Hey come out.
[31:52] Ariba
[31:54] Where are you?
[31:57] Take care of your sister.
[31:59] Lest you just watch and she would embarrass us and run away with Mahir.
[32:04] With Mahir?
[32:05] Faraz's brother Mahir.
[32:07] Sometime he comes to give her purse and sometime drops her.
[32:10] And Mahnoor
[32:12] Cover up her brother in law by saying that she has sent him here.
[32:15] There is no such thing sister.
[32:17] Really?
[32:18] Then what's the matter? Tell you sister.
[32:19] Tell her what were you planning there?
[32:22] They both were planning to run away and get married.
[32:24] I have heard myself.
[32:25] No, there is no such thing.
[32:27] Mahir and I were just only....
[32:28] Have some shame.
[32:30] You crossed all limits in stubbornness.
[32:33] I understood that night
[32:35] There is some thing fishy going on.
[32:38] And I realized that
[32:40] You talk with him on phone.
[32:42] You knew everything but didn't inform me.
[32:45] Are all you sisters alike?
[32:47] Saqlain.
[32:47] Mahnoor didn't say anything to Ramsha neither did you say anything.
[32:52] Mahnoor knows about it?
[32:54] Yes she knows everything.
[32:56] I have heard her conversation with Mahir myself.
[32:58] And Mahir is doing all this due to Faraz's support.
[33:03] Ask Mahnoor and Faraz to come here. I want to talk to them.
[33:08] Hadn't Mahnoor humiliated us earlier and now Ramsha is doing the same.
[33:12] Call her, why are you standing like this.
[33:15] Get away.
[33:16] Get out of my sight.
[33:18] Get lost before I would do something.
[33:20] Get out.
[33:27] Hey call her.
[33:40] If Faraz is not satisfied then we can wait
[33:45] Wait a minute.
[33:48] Hi
[33:50] What's up sister Ariba?
[33:51] Come home right now, immediately.
[33:54] Right now?
[33:55] Is everything alright?
[33:57] No it's not.
[33:59] Come here right now, right away. Immediately.
[34:01] And bring Faraz with you.
[34:03] Saqlain and I want to talk to him.
[34:07] But sister, at least tell me what happened?
[34:13] It was sister Ariba's call. She has asked me to come home.
[34:18] And she said that they want to meet you as well.
[34:24] Why?
[34:26] It's fine to invite you but why have they invited Faraz?
[34:29] This will be known by going there, Aunt.
[34:31] It's OK if Faraz is not going with me. I will go myself.
[34:36] No, Mahnoor I will go with you.
[34:38] We will be back mom..
[34:40] Let's go.
[34:48] Why have they invited Faraz?
[35:01] So you knew everything. Right?
[35:03] You knew about that Ramsha is interested in Mahir.
[35:06] Yes
[35:08] I knew about it.
[35:13] And Faraz?
[35:15] You too?
[35:16] Sister Ariba we...
[35:18] Why are you asking one after another?
[35:21] You didn't believe me when I informed you.
[35:25] All of this happening with their support.
[35:27] There is no such thing at all.
[35:29] Ever since I came to know about it, I was advising Ramsha.
[35:33] That she should treat Mahir only as a class fellow.
[35:37] And Faraz
[35:38] Faraz had forbidden Mahir.
[35:42] And despite your forbidding, they are both spending time with each other.
[35:45] Despite of going to university, they were moving around the city.
[35:51] And your sister Ramsha.
[35:53] Embarrassing us by spending time with that boy.
[35:57] I
[35:58] Let me talk to Ramsha and make her understand.
[36:01] What will you advise her?
[36:03] Hmm
[36:04] Is there anything left to talk to her?
[36:12] All of you have decided to humiliate me in front of my husband.
[36:18] Earlier you did it and now Ramsha is doing the same thing.
[36:21] You got married and left this house.
[36:25] I and Saqlain live in this house.
[36:27] We have Ramsha's responsibility.
[36:29] If she run away from house and get married to your brother in law
[36:33] Then I and Saqlain will not be able to face anyone.
[36:36] What are you talking about, sister Ariba?
[36:39] You know that Ramsha is not like that.
[36:41] But your brother in law is.
[36:59] And why are you staring at me like this Faraz?
[37:04] Don't you know about your brother?
[37:06] What's his nature?
[37:13] You have no idea what they were discussing when I caught them.
[37:17] Your brother was provoking Ramsha to run away and get married.
[37:23] And if wouldn't have reached there then they would have done that.
[37:28] You know your brother. Right?
[38:03] I got tired by advising you but didn't listen to me.
[38:07] I feared that this will happen.
[38:09] But you
[38:12] From now onward she won't go to university.
[38:14] Sister
[38:16] You have studied whatever you could.
[38:20] Saqlain and I will search a groom and marry her.
[38:25] You are absolutely right.
[38:27] Do whatever you find suitable.
[38:30] I feel too that there is no need for Ramsha to go to university.
[38:34] Listen to me
[38:36] You can't do this to me.
[38:39] Sister
[38:41] Please listen to me sister.
[38:43] Sister
[39:21] Mom I need some amount.
[39:23] As I told you that I don't have anything.
[39:25] Mom I asked you for a little amount. What happened to you?
[39:29] Mahir
[39:29] Yes brother
