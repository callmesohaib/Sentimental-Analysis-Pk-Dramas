[01:01] I don't understand you at all
[01:05] the way you're bothering yourself for so many years for your in-laws, just for the sake of the property
[01:11] sometimes fight with this one or that one
[01:16] what do you get by doing it?
[01:19] just a few lacs in a year?
[01:23] that too you steal in the name of maintenance or tax by making fraud documents
[01:36] those few lacs are for little expense
[01:39] my real eye is on their property which worth billions
[01:45] this is what I am saying
[01:47] that you are wasting your time for such a little amount
[01:52] I think, you should use a tactic & get all the properties transferred in your name
[02:00] we should also get some commission
[02:05] you can burn your mouth by eating very hot food
[02:10] therefore its better to eat the food when it gets cold
[02:14] so that your mouth don't get burn
[02:18] as far as that old woman is concerned
[02:20] then a cancer namely Saqlain has entered in her life along with her daughters life long time ago
[02:26] which will end her life slowly & gradually
[02:33] anyways, leave it
[02:35] tell me the update about the shops case
[02:40] shops case is easy, its decision will be made within a few days
[02:45] and God willing it will be in our favor
[02:48] Besides, that tenant is in your hands
[02:54] everything will happen as per your will
[03:27] Mahi
[03:29] yes
[03:30] what happen, why aren't you eating dinner? its getting cold
[03:33] yes..
what are you thinking?
[03:35] no, I am eating food. I was just thinking about my office work
[03:41] why, what happen? Is there a lot of work in your office?
[03:46] yes... honestly the work load is too much
[03:50] but I am worried about the fact that I am not getting enough time to prepare for my CSS exam
[03:57] how shall I do the preparation?
[03:58] whatever time I get, it gets spent while understanding the office related work & matters
[04:04] what happen dear? what was the need to take such a big responsibility?
[04:08] God has blessed us with everything, there isn't any shortage of anything
[04:11] you should have done your exam preparation
[04:13] exactly!
[04:16] mom, I had told you earlier that I am not doing this job for money but for experience
[04:23] and then, a lot had happened in my life
[04:27] that in order to come out of it, I found this way only
[04:32] it will take some time to understand & manage things
[04:35] slowly & gradually everything will be fine. I will handle it. Don't worry
[04:39] I am eating the food, you also eat
[04:54] please eat dinner, and the rice are really good
[05:08] what is the matter?
[05:10] you seem quite worried, and you haven't eaten the dinner properly
[05:16] is everything alright?
[05:20] No Areeba, nothing is fine
[05:23] and I don't understand
[05:26] how to share this problem with your mother
[05:31] what happen? why are you scaring me?
[05:35] what as such is the matter that you aren't telling me
[05:39] Areeba, you already know about the illegal possession on aunt's shop
[05:43] yes, I know
[05:44] I had done a case for that shop in the civil court
[05:49] we have got its decision
[05:52] what is the decision of the case?
[05:55] the decision is.. 
[05:58] that guy is present in that shop from the past ten years, his business is well settled
[06:04] he cannot change his shop
[06:07] either we should sell him the shop or do the settlement on the rent
[06:14] how can we sell our shop to anyone forcefully?
[06:18] and this is not right that any tenant will do an illegal possession on our shop
[06:26] this is what I am worried about
[06:29] if I file an appeal against this decision, then it will waste our time & money both
[06:36] because such cases are never ending
[06:45] and I don't understand how to share this news with aunt
[06:53] but we have to tell mom
[06:56] but.. she will be so worried
[07:00] I have an idea about her worries but Mahnoor will create a lot of chaos
[07:07] she will shift the entire blame on me
[07:09] however, I've been fighting this case since a lot of months
[07:13] what are you saying?
[07:16] Mahnoor is not blind to shift the blame you!
[07:20] whatever it is, its in front of all. You've worked so hard on this case
[07:26] now will everything happen according to Mahnoor?
[07:34] look, I'm thinking that we shall sell the shop
[07:38] see, after this decision he will become more powerful
[07:42] maybe he doesn't pay the rent & occupy the shop illegally once again
[07:46] what if we lose the shop & the rent too
[07:55] shall I talk to mom?
[07:57] No.. not so soon, wait for a while
[08:00] let me talk to him first
[08:03] I want to see what price he offers for that shop
[08:07] after that we'll talk to your mom
[08:19] don't worry, let me bring water for you
[08:37] fool!
[08:44] I don't understand what does he want from me!
[08:48] didn't you see what rubbish he wrote in that letter
[08:52] he is annoying you, simple!
[08:53] earlier he used to annoy you by following your van, & now he is annoying you by throwing letters
[09:00] this matter is killing me, Ok?
[09:02] we are getting wrong phone calls at home
[09:05] in fact, when mom or sister Salma attends the call. Nobody responds, neither hello or hi
[09:10] so you should pick up the call
[09:14] No, thank you!
[09:16] I mean, what if I receive the call & its the same guy on the other side and he responds. Then what will I say?
[09:21] well, I think its such a nice thing
[09:25] now think, this way you'll get to know what does he do. Where does he live, bla bla... 
[09:31] yes absolutely! and the death angel that we have in the shape of brother Saqlain
[09:38] if he gets to know about the letter or the phone call, then?
[09:42] hmm... 
[09:45] do you have the van driver's number?
[09:48] yes, I have why?
[09:49] send that number to me
[09:52] I'm sure the van driver must be knowing about that guy. Somehow we'll get some information
[09:58] I'll solve this issue myself, just send me the number
[10:02] its a good idea, you are right. Let me send you via watsapp right away
[10:05] my phone is inside the room, just send it. I'll check it later
[10:37] greetings!*
[10:40] you are here so early in the morning! is everything alright?
[10:44] yes, I wanted to talk to aunt about the shop's case. I thought it would be better to discuss it in front of you
[10:52] by the way, it was Ramsha's van driver right? Why he came? all good?
[10:57] I had called him here. I'm thinking to arrange a transport for myself
[11:01]  it doesn't look nice to use the cab on regular basis until I don't get a car from my office
[11:06] that's why
[11:07] Okay... come, lets sit inside & talk
[11:11] what as such the matter is that you specially want to discuss in front of me
[11:16] as it is, you handle all the matters. Mom is inside, you can talk to her
[11:21] it is you who always complain, that I don't keep you in a loop before taking any decision
[11:26] I thought it would be better to discuss the matter in front of you
[11:29] mom should be aware of all the matters, I had never objected on my behalf
[11:35] Okay I am getting late, so I am leaving for office
[11:38] I've a board meeting at 9 Am, so I cannot be late. Just now I've joined the office
[11:43] if you are getting late, then let me drop you. I will meet aunt in the evening. Come
[11:47] hey no, there is no need of it. I will manage
[11:49] you do a lot of formality
[11:52] come, let me drop you. Its alright. I will get to see your office as well
[11:56] come
[12:32] your office is really nice, they have such a good reputation in the market
[12:37] even the management is really good, very cooperative
[12:41] that's good! I think soon you will adjust here
[12:45] I think now you shouldn't think about giving CSS exam
[12:48] continue your job here, as there is a lot of scope in it
[12:53] greetings maam!
[12:55] greetings!*
[13:01] I shall leave now, thanks for taking out so much time
[13:07] not a problem, take care
[13:37] hello!
[13:38] why Mahnoor had called you at home?
[13:40] she had to discuss something important
[13:43] important discussion about what?
[13:45] about the same guy who came to your house while following the van
[13:51] yes, I was about to contact you myself
[13:53] if you have any details of that guy then tell me, I want to fix him!
[13:57] even sister Mahnoor was asking the same thing
[13:59] I have told her the same thing that I don't know anything related to this matter
[14:03] usually such matters happen, the guys follow girls
[14:08] and usually the girls are involved in these matters
[14:11] they have their own friendships that's why we don't give it any importance
[14:15] because we also have a family, why will we fight with everyone?
[14:19] you are right, one needs to be careful
[14:21] if you get any information about that guy then there is no need to inform Mahnoor
[14:26] she is a girl, what will she do?
[14:29] Besides, I have an idea that Ramsha must be very well aware of it
[14:34] if that guy has come to our house then for sure Ramsha must be friends with him
[14:39] anyways, don't try to contact Mahnoor
[14:44] do let me know if you get any information
[14:48] after all, its our family's matter. I will handle it myself
[14:52] okay brother Saqlain
[15:32] its absolutely correct, I have checked it
[15:37] Faraz
[15:39] how is your mother now?
[15:42] I mean, is she fine?
[15:44] yes
[16:00] come in
[16:10] thank you!
[16:15] listen! whose medicines are these?
[16:19] these medicines are of Mr. Faraz. He had asked me to bring it along with the tea. So I am going to give him right now
[16:24] is he not well?
[16:26] yes maam, it seems he is having a high grade fever. He had ask me specially to bring the medicines, so I am going to give him
[16:31] Okay, go
[16:50] go, take out the papers
[17:11] hello!
[17:12] hello!
[17:15] who is this speaking?
[17:16] I? Sajid
[17:20] who Sajid?
[17:22] whose phone is it, Ramsha?
[17:27] nothing! I think it was a wrong number
[17:33] who is it who is calling again & again, but isn't talking!
[17:37] hello!
[17:38] hello?
[17:41] did you see? he hung up as soon as he heard my voice
[17:46] note down the number & give it to me
[17:48] let me give it to Saqlain and ask him to check who is annoying us
[17:53] No... please no, what is the need to discuss with brother Saqlain? He must be a psychopath
[18:00] if you will tell this to brother Saqlain then he will scold me first & then the matter will get solved
[18:07] please don't tell anything to brother Saqlain. You'll see, he will stop calling in a few days
[18:14] please
[18:42] good morning!
[18:43] good morning! please sit
[18:45] check the price list once, I've already checked it
[18:48] and then send it to the GM
[18:54] Faraz, are you not well?
[18:58] yes
[19:00] if you were having fever & you weren't well, then you shouldn't have come to the office today
[19:07] but anyways, still if you want you can go home
[19:17] I've taken medicine
[19:19] its a minor temperature
[19:23] and one cannot sit at home because of it
[19:25] there was a board meeting today, which couldn't be missed
[19:29] a person should have a tolerance power to manage its personal & professional problems
[19:42] I've so much of control to handle my stress easily
[19:49] that's a good thing
[19:55] maam, this file came from the finance department for a review
[19:59] ok
[20:00] come, let me take you to the department
[20:02] lets go
[21:22] brother
[21:22] yes
[21:23] drink this hot milk
[21:24] tell me, are you fine now?
[21:27] its better now
[21:29] Faraz, what was the harm in taking a day off from your office?
[21:34] you could have got some rest, as you are not well
[21:37] no mom, I am not so unwell to sit at home after leaving the job
[21:44] you know how important this job is for all of us
[21:47] our survival is based on it
[21:50] if I lose my job, then I don't know how we are going to manage
[21:54] mom, did you see?
[21:56] brother don't leave a chance to taunt us, that he is running this house
[22:00] brother, you are the eldest of this house. You are well-educated, & you also earn
[22:05] if there is a problem then tell us. Lets do one thing, let me & Aima start doing the job
[22:11] why are you diverting the topic, Maheer? Brother Faraz hadn't said any such thing
[22:15] and this is true! this house is only running on brother Faraz's earning
[22:20] brother Faraz takes care of our educational expenses too
[22:24] and your university fee! that too will be paid by brother Faraz
[22:28] there won't be any external help
[22:30] enough! what happen?
[22:33] can't you see your brother is not well & here you guys are fighting
[22:37] mom, am I fighting? Aima is fighting with me
[22:40] you had started to taunt
[22:41] enough Aima, be quiet
[22:49] Maheer, have you submitted the admission form?
[22:52] yes, I have
[22:54] one more thing
[22:56] By next week, If I didn't pay my admission fee
[23:00] then my admission will be canceled
[23:03] rest you guys are wise enough!
[23:10] Aima, go bring tea for me
[23:18] Saqlain, this is Ramsha's admission fee challan
[23:22] kindly pay it
[23:30] Ok aunt, I will submit it. Don't worry
[23:36] So, finally you've fulfilled your dream just like your sister Mahnoor
[23:41] you took admission in the university
[23:44] but dear, just be careful
[23:46] what if your focus diverts after going to the university
[23:50] aunt, actually the university environment is quite open as there are no restrictions
[23:58] dear, even Mahnoor used to go to the university
don't give her example
[24:03] God forbid that our Ramsha follows Mahnoor's footsteps
[24:13] anyways, I wanted to tell you that your account balance is quite low
[24:19] and Mahnoor's wedding expenses... First of all, Mahnoor didn't get married, but there was a lot of expense
[24:26] and then, we've spent a lot of money on our shop's case
[24:31] and now...
[24:33] you've given me Ramsha's fee challan
[24:37] see, the motive behind telling you is that
[24:40] kindly be careful with your expense for some time
[24:45] I am getting your point, besides I've lessen my household expenses. I spend after giving it a lot of thought
[24:53] yes aunt, I have an idea
[24:56] I can't see Mahnoor, haven't she come back from office as of yet?
[25:02] she had called to inform that she will be a bit late as there is a meeting
[25:07] by the way aunt, I really don't like those girls who stays out of the house for so long
[25:13] Mahnoor should at least come back home on her time
[25:18] the problem is that Mahnoor doesn't listens to anyone
[25:22] if I put some restrictions, then she minds like always
[25:53] Mr. Faraz, please sit for a minute
[26:03] few days ago you've given this loan application, right?
[26:08] which I had to forward to the GM
[26:11] I'm so sorry, I was so busy in work that I completely forgot
[26:15] I hope you don't need it on an urgent basis
[26:22] I've to pay my brother's university fee next week
[26:27] oh!
[26:28] for the entire semester
[26:30] that's why I've applied for a loan against my provident fund, so that I can pay off on monthly basis
[26:35] you should have reminded me once
[26:38] but anyways, don't take tension.
[26:41] I will take this application to the GM & will take approval from him personally and get your cheque cleared
[26:49] thank you!
[26:50] no problem
[27:11] Shaista, please come in my room. Thank you!
[27:41] hey hello! wait a minute
[27:51] what is this happening?
[27:52] nothing!
[27:54] I thought you'll stop these actions, since you saw me here
[27:58] but you've become more courageous now, you've started to call on the land line number too
[28:02] No, I haven't
[28:03] from where you got the number?
[28:04] number?
[28:06] do you have Ramsha's number too?
[28:08] No, I don't have
[28:11] today on wards, if I see you here then I will thrash you so hard that your seven generations will remember
[28:17] understand!
[28:22] now leave, people make mistakes
[28:25] I will explain her too
[28:27] and whatever I have explained you, focus on that
[28:31] why Saqlain in requesting this guy?
[28:35] come, lets find out who is this guy
[28:38] wait a minute
[28:40] respectable people live here, why are you adamant to disrespect them?
[28:44] go away!
[29:00] what is the matter, Saqlain? Is everything fine?
[29:04] and who was this guy, to whom you were requesting a lot?
[29:09] what to tell you, uncle?
[29:11] when a person is helpless then they are compelled to fold their hands in front of others
[29:15] if the father of these girls would have been alive, then I wouldn't be burdened so much
[29:19] dear, after all what is the matter? At least tell us something
[29:25] what to tell you uncle? I feel ashamed while telling it to you
[29:30] and whatever I am about to tell you, please don't tell anyone
[29:37] actually Ramsha is having an affair with this guy
[29:44] please, I request you... not to tell this matter to anyone
[29:49] please
[30:16] it seems that the younger sister is also following her elder sister's footsteps
[30:20] may God show these sisters the right path
[30:22] they haven't left their old mother capable enough to show her face to anyone
[30:27] you are right
[30:37] brother, what happen to the car?
[30:40] sister, I'm checking. Please sit inside, don't stand here
[30:43] its night time, also its a desolate area. Usually robberies happen here
[30:48] Ok please be quick. And if the problem is big then tell me so that I can book another ride
[30:53] give me 5 minutes, if it gets fixed then its fine. Otherwise, you can book another ride
[30:57] Okay
[31:31] hello!
[31:32] Hello Mahi, have you seen the time? Its 8pm, where have you been?
[31:37] mom, I've left the office. Its just that my car broke down, that's why I got late
[31:42] oh God! your car broke down at this hour!
[31:47] do one thing, book another ride & come home immediately
[31:49] I will wait for 5 to 7 more minutes, if this car won't get fixed then I will book another ride
[31:56] Ok, come home quickly I am feeling so anxious
[32:00] don't worry, I am coming in a while. Bye!
[32:06] brother..
[32:09] brother, what is the update?
[32:11] sister, I am unable to find the fault please book another ride
[32:15] Okay
[32:20] keep it
[32:24] don't know what is this location
[33:16] Faraz!
[33:17] maam Mahnoor, you are here at this hour!
[33:21] actually I had booked this cab & it broke down, now I am waiting for another cab
[33:31] oh!
[33:33] So till when the other ride will be here? Ask the driver
[33:39] it will take some time to come here, presently the driver is quite far
[33:44] its quite a desolate area
[33:48] the driver will be here within 15 to 20 minutes
[33:51] 15 to 20 minutes? You'll wait here for the driver all alone for the next 15 to 20 minutes!
[33:54] its not safe for you
[33:56] no problem! I will wait. You may go, you already got so late today
[34:02] please go home, I am fine
[34:04] No, I cannot leave you alone over here
[34:07] anything can happen, its a night time
[34:09] No, nothing will happen. I will stay safe, please go
[34:14] Okay maam, if you don't mind then can I drop you?
[34:22] No Faraz, there is no need of it. Don't bother yourself
[34:26] No, there isn't anything to be bothered about. Please listen to me, I will drop you
[34:30] not just for you, even its not safe for me
[34:35] please come, let me drop you
[34:39] Ok, can you please drop me to the bus stop. I will get another ride easily from there
[34:46] yes sure, please come
[34:48] thank you!
[35:37] I was about to call you
[35:40] you took so long to come back
[35:41] yes, I had gone to your mother's house after office
[35:45] to discuss, that the expenses have increased a lot in last few months
[35:50] but instead of asking me that whether do we have enough amount in the account or not
[35:54] she gave me the new bill of expense
[35:57] see
[36:00] this is Ramsha's college admission fee challan
[36:03] nobody knows from where this 2.5 lacs will come
[36:06] yes, so you should have asked my mother to tell Mahnoor to pay Ramsha's fee
[36:14] Ramsha's university fee is so high. Besides, Mahnoor earns very well that she can pay
[36:19] Mahnoor isn't earning the money so easily
[36:22] she is working day & night non-stop
[36:24] she hadn't come back home as of yet
[36:27] Mahnoor hadn't come home as of yet?
[36:29] yes! even aunt was so worried. She was calling her again & again
[36:34] her number was off, maybe she was busy in some meeting
[36:37] it happens
[36:40] but Areeba, try to explain Mahnoor
[36:43] if she will come back so late from the office, then what will he neighbors think?
[36:48] just a few days ago she got divorced
[36:50] why is giving a chance to this society to raise their fingers on her?
[36:54] yes, you are absolutely correct!
[36:57] Mahnoor doesn't listen to anyone
[37:00] it would have been better if we would have married her somewhere. What was the need for her to do the job?
[37:08] anyways, tell me.. did you talk to my mother about the shop & the case?
[37:15] No, I haven't discussed this with aunt as of yet
[37:18] I didn't get a chance
[37:21] Besides, I want Mahnoor to be present there when I talk to aunt on this matter
[37:26] what if later she blames me that they have faced the loss because of me
