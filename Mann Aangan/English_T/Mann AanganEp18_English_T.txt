[00:58] The necklace that you gifted me on our anniversary was robbed by the robbers too.
[01:02] Areeba! I'll get ten more necklaces for you but my first priority is your safety.
[01:06] What else!
[01:07] I'm happy that Mahnoor's deposit is safe.
[01:15] I cannot understand one thing!
[01:21] How did they already know that we have 2.5 million rupees in a cupboard.
[01:40] Yes Saqlain! Areeba is right.
[01:49] I think someone leaked this information.
[01:51] Leaked it?
[01:54] Yes! They knew that there is cash in the house.
[02:02] They also knew that the cash is in your cupboard.
[02:08] I think that the person who leaked such information is someone really close to you! Someone whom you know too.
[02:21] Only the contractor knew that I have cash in my house! He was the only one who was trying to dodge me by not receiving his payment from a week.
[02:29] I think he is the one behind it.
[02:30] Fine! We should quickly file a complaint in the police.
[02:35] You should also tell the police that you suspect that contractor too.
[02:39] Robber might get caught!
[02:41] Yes Saqlain! Do as she says.
[02:45] Sure! I'll report tomorrow.
[02:47] Tomorrow? It'll be late to report tomorrow.
[02:51] If you delay the report to police, you are making it hard for the police to investigate.
[02:56] We should quickly inform the police.
[02:58] Shouldn't we?
[02:59] Sure!
[03:00] Mahnoor! You know very well about the investigations of police and how quick they catch the robbers.
[03:05] See Areeba's condition right now. She is so stressed!
[03:09] If I call the police here for inquiry, she'll get more upset.
[03:14] My house got robbed! You should not be the one to worry about it.
[03:21] Don't worry! I'll handle it. Please sit down.
[03:26] Please don't worry darling.
[03:30] Let it go! You should thank god that you are safe.
[03:37] Control yourself! We are here for you.
[04:03] Sir! What happens by taking your complain back? More rumors get built up like this.
[04:13] Everybody is discussing that there is an affair between Mahnoor and Faraz.
[04:22] It is fine that you don't really care that the company faced embarrassment! Does Mahnoor care about her embarrassment?
[04:31] A girl should specially keep such stuff private when she is already roaming around with the label of divorc√©e.
[04:55] I'm just talking about something that's already famous about you. Your story of divorce is the center of attraction in this office.
[05:11] Doesn't Mahnoor care about her self respect that she has an affair with her colleague. She cares about her career only! She doesn't feel embarrassed.
[05:24] Sister! I'm getting goosebumps by just imagining the robbers. They entered Areeba's house.
[05:37] But how would they know about the amount of cash that's in the house?
[05:46] This means that they were good planners and well informed. Right?!
[05:53] Planners are those who sent them! They inform them with the details of the house.
[06:01] You are right!
[06:07]  Judging Saqlain's facial expressions and emotions! Why do I feel like it was not a surprise for him?
[06:15] He was delaying the report to police too.
[06:19] There is something that I cannot understand and ignore at the same time.
[06:55] Faraz! What happened son?
[07:02] Mother! I want to talk to you about something important.
[07:05] Is it about your job?
[07:07] No! Everything is fine about my job.
[07:11] Then what? You look worried! Tell me.
[07:17] No! I'm not worried. I was just pushing myself to take a step and I have decided to take it.
[07:28] About what?
[07:38] I have decided to marry Mahnoor!
[07:44] Mahnoor?
[07:47] Who complained against you to the police?
[07:48] That was a misunderstanding! It got clear and she took a stand for me.
[07:54] Today people are talking bad about her because she chose to support me.
[08:02] There's a reason when people talk bad about her! We were embarrassed due to a lie and now this.
[08:17] There was a great proposal for Aima, and they rejected afterwards because...
[08:22] Mother! Aima will get married to someone great and loving. She is young right now and studying.
[08:33] You are worrying about her too early.
[08:36] I just want you to take my proposal  for Mahnoor to her house and talk to them.
[08:45] Talk to her mother about our marriage.
[09:45] What happened? Didn't you sleep properly?
[09:54] I'm just haunted by thinking that if they didn't find the cash...
[10:03] Nothing happened!
[10:06] I mean that I know it's very traumatic!
[10:10] I should have listened to you and secured that amount in a bank! It's my fault.
[10:19] Listen!
[10:23] You should file a report in a police station.
[10:26] Why do you act like Mahnoor?
[10:29] I'll file a report! It's my problem to handle, not yours.
[10:36] You can also watch the actions of police afterwards. Now go and make breakfast for me.
[10:42] I'll stop at a police station before going to my office.
[11:48] Najma!
[11:50] Najma!
[11:51] Yes ma'am!
[11:52] Is the breakfast ready?
[11:54] Yes it is!
[11:56] Tea?
[11:56] Tea is not ready yet.
[11:58] Get it ready!
[12:24] I told you not to call me!
[12:27] You've started to call me in the morning like lunatics.
[12:31] Listen to me carefully.
[12:35] If you don't listen! You'll be responsible.
[12:38] Right now! I don't want something bad to occur in my life.
[12:45] What happened?
[12:50] Are you alright? Who are you scolding?
[12:55] It's my staff from Hyderabad!
[12:58] I just told them everything at night and they called me again.
[13:03] Everybody is a fool! I'll have to kick them.
[13:06] It's not good to be angry in the morning.
[13:09] Come! Your breakfast is ready.
[13:14] Sure! Lets do breakfast together.
[13:23] Sir I just want that nobody should criticize Mahnoor.
[13:31] I've been worried the whole night.
[13:34] Areeba looked scared when she left.
[13:37] I should call and ask her about her health.
[13:41] Mother! Areeba is courageous.
[13:44] I mean if I saw a gun in the hand of the robbers! I would've passed out at the spot.
[13:50] Robberies nowadays are on hike. May god protect us.
[14:01] Mahi!
[14:03] Yes!
[14:05] What are you thinking? Why are you not eating?
[14:10] Mother! She is thinking about the robbery in Areeba's home. She hasn't slept the whole night.
[14:17] Its obvious! Areeba lost her jewelery worth millions in the robbery.
[14:25] I'm amazed that so much happened and Saqlain didn't even complain to the police.
[14:31] Darling! What will police do about it? Everyone is involved in such activities.
[14:36] You mean that when their house got robbed, Saqlain thought that the robbers and police were involved together?
[14:41] But when he had to falsely accuse Faraz! He trusted the police.
[14:47] I'm amazed!
[14:49] Where are you going?
[14:51] What? You know well where I go everyday.
[14:55] Eat your breakfast properly.
[15:01] I've done it! I'm gonna go now. Goodbye!
[15:06] What's with her?
[15:09] She didn't eat her dinner properly last night, and now she left for her office without eating her breakfast.
[15:12] There's something else going on inside her mind. She is hiding something that she is worried about.
[15:18] It might be!
[15:36] Faraz told me something weird!
[15:42] If you ask me the truth. I'm not happy with this proposal.
[15:49] Mother! You should not go to their home then! Deny to Faraz about this proposal. He'll surely listen to you and do everything according to your saying.
[15:59] I don't understand a thing mother. Why are you not happy?
[16:04] I can't understand what's going on too.
[16:10] I thought that I'll get you married first.
[16:16] It was such a great proposal! Lost our chance.
[16:21] Just because of that Mahnoor, we had to go through some disrespect.
[16:32] Whatever! Faraz wants to marry her now.
[16:38] What? Faraz wants to marry Mahnoor?
[16:45] Maheer! What's there to laugh about?
[16:50] Tell me that is this Faraz's wish or Mahnoor wants it too?
[16:56] Faraz told me to take his proposal to their house.
[16:59] It's obvious that theres something between them.
[17:04] I cannot believe that Mahnoor is interested in Faraz.
[17:11] Mother! If it is like that. You should go to her house and approve this proposal.
[17:19] Have you seen her living standard? She earns more than Faraz.
[17:26] It seems like that the family background is solid. It would be great for us.
[17:37] Don't deny.
[18:17] Thank you!
[18:20] Mention not!
[18:30] Did you say something?
[18:33] No!
[18:39] Actually I want to talk about something personal to you.
[18:44] Faraz! I'm busy right now.
[18:49] Yes! I can see that you're busy.
[18:54] It won't be that long!
[18:56] Faraz! I think you didn't listen that I'm busy right now.
[19:00] In office! You should talk to me about things related to our work. Nothing personal.
[19:05] You may leave now! Thank you.
[19:31] Yes!
[19:37] What is this?
[19:38] Sir! You told me to get the payment of 2.5 million rupees ready. It's the check for it.
[19:46] Yes! I told you.
[20:02] My whole planning went to waste.
[20:05] I hope I could scold Areeba on her such foolish act. I don't know yet that she saw me alone or with her.
[20:16] If she had seen me with her. She would've talked to me about it.
[21:24] Mahnoor!
[21:26] Yes!
[21:27] Office time is over! We are not in the office anymore so I want to talk to you about something personal!
[21:43] I've decided to marry you.
[21:59] I think that to shut people's mouth and help you with the situation, this is the only way.
[22:07] Soon I'll bring my mother to your house.
[22:10] To talk about our marriage! If you want to reject the proposal, you may reject it on the spot. There's nobody forcing you.
[22:22] Faraz! Faraz listen to me.
[22:28] How should I tell him that this cannot happen?
[22:53] I told you that I'm in Hyderabad! I'm in a meeting in office. If you don't trust me, you can video call me.
[23:17] How are you Nimra? I'm also doing great.
[23:28] Listen! You were telling me about your cousin that she is expecting a baby after 10 years.
[23:41] Can you tell me about her gynecologist.
[23:49] Sure! I'm looking forward to changing my gynecologist too.
[23:54] I want to visit some other doctor. There might be a miracle in my life too.
[24:04] I'll be waiting for you.
[24:07] Goodbye!
[24:13] Everything I saw was true! It was not a misunderstanding.
[24:19] It happened because I didn't give birth. If that's not the reason.
[24:28] Was it really a misunderstanding?
[24:30] I should think everything according to the situation, before I become a burden on Saqlain.
[24:38] I should make him happy by giving birth.
[24:51] How should I stop him?
[25:03] Greetings!
[25:07] Darling! You came home and didn't even meet me? You sitting here by yourself.
[25:12] Mother! I had an important call. I would've came after it.
[25:17] I know Mahi that you are worried.
[25:20] I'm sorry that I cannot do anything.
[25:23] What ever happened! What ever is happening! I don't have the power to control it.
[25:30] You can surely help the situations to get settled, by getting married.
[25:38] You can work wherever you want to after your marriage!
[25:42] Your husbands name will be there with you so nobody will ever talk bad about you.
[25:57] You should think about my statement.
[26:03] The proposal that Saqlain shared is really great.
[26:11] You haven't eaten anything from the morning, right? I'll tell Salma to get your lunch ready. You should get fresh.
[26:44] I didn't know that he'll suddenly start to behave like a stranger.
[26:50] Yes!
[27:01] Why don't you study properly? You should focus on your studies.
[27:09] We need good marks! Sure! My sister just came.
[27:14] I don't know what's his reason of being mad at me.
[27:20] Aunt! I cannot find time to maintain those shops properly.
[27:26] I have my own business too so that's why there are so many things to look after.
[27:30] Whatever! Tell me about your health.
[27:34] It's better than before.
[27:42] How are you?
[27:43] Fine! What about you?
[27:46] Saqlain! Did you find out something about the robbery? You wouldn't have complained about it to the police.
[27:53] It's not like that!
[27:55] I've complained about it to the police? I've placed the contractor in the suspecting list.
[28:04] Police is performing their duty. We'll know about it soon.
[28:06] That's great! If you go in loss, it's the same for us.
[28:11] At least we should get to know about the one who was involved in the robbery.
[28:18] You are right! How is your office?
[28:24] Is everything fine there?
[28:26] Everything is fine in the office! I've fixed everything.
[28:30] You know it.
[28:44] Ma'am! There are some guests for Mahnoor.
[28:52] Mahi's guests?
[28:55] Did you invite anyone?
[28:57] Mother! 
[29:03] Greetings!
[29:08] Greetings!
[29:10] Mother! this is Faraz who works with me in the office and this is his mother.
[29:15] Please get seated. Salma! Get the tea ready.
[29:21] Please come. Come!
[29:27] Here.
[29:50] Why did you guys come?
[29:58] As Mahnoor told that both Mahnoor and Faraz work together, so I've came here with the proposal of my son Faraz for Mahnoor.
[30:38] You think that Mahnoor is that cheap?
[30:42] That she'll get married to your son Faraz?
[30:53] And we would allow her?
[31:02] I cannot even believe that why would you think coming here without knowing about your status.
[31:26] Will he marry my sister?
[31:28] You've come here with the proposal of such a low class boy.
[31:44] Areeba please! Have you forgotten the way to behave with the guests?
[31:48] You have to treat guests according to their status.
[31:59] He is a harasser! A disrespectful guy! If you had taken an action against him. He would've never dared to come to this house.
[32:16] We have no interest in your son's proposal.
[32:21] We have already decided a groom for Mahnoor!
[32:27] Faraz wait!
[32:30] Aunt please sit down!
[32:36] I'm asking! Please.
[32:53] I'm sorry aunt for the behavior of my family.
[33:05] Saqlain! Who told you to decide my future?
[33:10] Mother! I told you that Saqlain should not get involved in my marriage.
[33:15] Mahi?
[33:16] You wanted me to get married. Now I'm ready to get married.
[33:38] I have a deal that you won't reject their proposal.
[33:50] I'll marry him only! No one else.
[34:02] Saqlain wait!
[34:07] Areeba!
[34:23] I want to apologize to you guys.
[34:41] Mother! Drink some water.
[34:45] Add some poison in it for me, so that I can die peacefully.
[34:52] Why are you so angry? Did some fight occur?
[34:56] I went through a lot of disrespect today.
[35:01] They disrespected me so much that I should have died before going there.
[35:08] Mahnoor and her mother apologized to you!
[35:10] What about her sister and brother in law?
[35:13] Did you forget there behavior?
[35:16] They disrespected us so much as if we were their old enemies.
[35:25] This means that they rejected?
[35:27] It would've been so great if they had rejected.
[35:31] But that Mahnoor stood up and said that I'll only marry Faraz.
[35:46] Her mother forcefully approved.
[35:51] I faced so much disrespect! I won't ever forget and would never forgive.
[35:58] I won't ever forgive. If they are rich, what do they think of themselves? That they can say or do whatever they want to.
[36:07] They have the respect of the whole world? What do they think of themselves? Don't we deserve respect?
[36:15] Mother! Drink some water.
[37:01] I know that you are mad at me and don't want to look at me.
[37:08] But I'll soon leave this house.
[37:11] You won't see my face again.
[37:15] You kept lying to me?
[37:17] You broke my trust and lied to me that you don't meet Faraz and you are not related to him.
[37:25] I never lied to you about it and I never broke your trust.
[37:30] You should trust me that before today, I had no relation with Faraz except colleague.
[37:39] Why are you marrying him?
[37:42] Come here.
[37:51] One day I had to marry someone, right? You said it yourself that if I get my husbands name as my surname, it'll shut people's mouth.
[38:01] Mahi! Faraz doesn't deserve you. Why him?
[38:09] We cannot decide that who deserves who.
[38:16] I thought that I deserved Wasay!
[38:20] I thought he would help me.
[38:26] What did he do? He didn't even take a stand for me.
[38:33] And Ashir! You chose him for me?
[38:37] What did he do? He took a revenge from me for his insult.
[38:46] I can't even call him a man.
[38:50] Saqlain told me that he is not a nice guy and people are talking about his first marriage.
[39:00] They judge to quick! They think of me the same way.
[39:07] That Wasay was the reason for my divorce. I had a relation with him.
[39:11] You know it very well that this ain't the truth.
[39:18] Let these people talk.
[39:23] We know the truth.
[39:28] I don't know that Faraz is good or bad! I just know that he is trying to protect me and he respects me.
[39:40] I think theres no better way to shut people's mouth.
[39:50] If Faraz wants to respectfully marry me, what's the big deal in it?
[39:59] Please! You should understand me.
