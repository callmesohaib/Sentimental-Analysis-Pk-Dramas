[01:14] how are you?
[01:15] I'm absolutely fine, you tell me how are you doing?
[01:18] Thank God I am also fine
[01:19] I can't see Aima
[01:23] she is resting as she is not feeling well
[01:26] please come, sit
[01:33] please sit
[01:38] So, is everything fine?
[01:43] I am absolutely fine, you tell me. You seem a bit worried
[01:48] the house is quite deserted, also Aima is not well...
[01:51] in fact, I think your eyes are swelled up
[01:56] No, there isn't any such thing. Everything is fine
[02:01] something got into my eye, maybe that's why you can feel the swelling
[02:06] everything is fine. 
Mahnoor must have gone to the office, right?
[02:11] No, nowadays Mahnoor is not going to the office
[02:14] has she left the job?
[02:16] No, she has taken leaves
[02:18] why, all good?
[02:21] yes, she is having exams
[02:25] please sit, let me bring tea for you..
No, no.. there is no need for any formality
[02:29] as it is I came to you uninformed
[02:33] no problem, its your own house
[02:35] actually I have some work with you & Mahnoor
[02:42] what work could you have with me & Mahnoor?
[02:45] actually, the matter is about Yasir but he is hesitating a bit
[02:50] he said, mom it will be much better if you talk
[02:54] what work do you have, I mean... 
[02:56] Actually, nowadays Yasir is so worried about his job
[03:01] he thought that he will get a promotion but... 
[03:04] don't know what politics is going in his office that he has become fed up of his job
[03:11] it happens, one needs to ignore
[03:15] Yasir's nature is a bit different, he doesn't compromise with things easily
[03:20] he had applied in Mahnoor's office for the job
[03:25] he wants Mahnoor to talk to her boss, so that he can adjust him somewhere
[03:33] Yasir himself is such an intelligent boy, why would he need Mahnoor's recommendation
[03:39] they will appoint him happily
[03:42] they will keep him only if there is any vacancy
[03:46] if Mahnoor & Faraz will talk to their boss for him, then I'm sure he'll take out some vacancy for him
[03:52] in fact, I must say if Mahnoor talks to her boss then he will take out some vacancy for sure
[03:58] actually, Yasir's job issue get resolved first then only I'll start wedding preparations
[04:08] are you getting my point?
[04:10] yes
[04:16] let me bring tea
[04:31] check it, satisfy yourself
[04:44] yes, check it
[04:46] satisfy yourself, if you find any jewelry then let me know
[04:58] are you satisfied?
[05:00] have you seen the phone?
[05:03] Ramsha had a phone & she was lying to you that she didn't had a phone
[05:11] but Maheer had said...
don't take that boy's name in front of me
[05:14] he will utter every single word when the police will scratch off his skin
[05:21] Besides, if I & you weren't relatives then I would have filed such a strict case on him
[05:27] that he would have rot in the prison for life time
[05:29] I would have punished him myself!
[06:37] sister Ramsha, your bag
[07:49] sister Areeba, Maheer is swearing upon his life that he doesn't have any concern with this matter
[07:55] let me do one thing, let me go & ask Ramsha that where has she kept sister Areeba's jewelry
[08:00] Mahnoor, wait
[08:03] sit here
[08:05] you can investigate Ramsha later
[08:09] sit
[08:14] yes
[08:19] I want to get Ramsha married as soon as possible
[08:23] Ok fine
[08:25] there is one proposal
[08:27] sister Areeba, we will talk on this matter later. Lets resolve Maheer's matter first
[08:32] why?
[08:33] don't you think that he'll again contact Ramsha after coming out of the police station?
[08:38] and both of them will elope?
[08:39] and Ramsha won't marry due to his support
[08:41] see, I will try to stop him. He will experience huge loss in his studies, maybe his university will expel him
[08:46] his life can be destroyed, you...
[08:49] please take the case back
[08:52] even after a lot had happened
[08:57] you people still think that we shall forgive him!
[09:00] please
[09:04] Okay
[09:06] what's the guarantee that he won't contact Ramsha after coming out of the prison?
[09:10] and he won't try to meet her again?
[09:13] sister Areeba, what are you saying? Who can take this guarantee?
[09:16] All of us had tried earlier as well, but what happened?
[09:20] Fine!
[09:22] Saqlain will take the FIR back once Ramsha gets married
[09:27] what are you saying! You are saying about the marriage as if it will happen within a day or two
[09:33] maybe it happens tomorrow, we'll do all the functions together
[09:37] really! and with whom you'll wed her off?
[09:41] there is one acquaintance, Mr. Tauqeer
[09:53] he is quite well off
[09:55] I've met him, in fact Ramsha has also met him
[10:06] who Mr. Taqueer? I'm hearing this name for the first time
[10:11] do you know him?
[10:14] brother Saqlain must have brought this proposal for sure, right?
[10:19] so what difference does it make?
[10:22] he is a nice person, besides Saqlain considers Ramsha as his younger sister
[10:28] he is thinking really good for her
[10:33] Saqlain's social circle is a bit different, this matter will stay hidden
[10:38] otherwise, whatever our sister has done
[10:42] her defamation incidents will reach them before them come to our house for her marriage proposal
[10:48] are you getting it?
[10:53] Ok tell me what does he do?
[10:56] he has some huge business
[10:59] he is an honorable man!
[11:01] its just that he is bit elder than Ramsha
[11:06] what's with you! Has Ramsha become a burden on you that you want to get rid of her like this?
[11:11] she is our younger sister, think for sometime. This is the matter of her entire life
[11:15] and the way she wants to ruin her life?
[11:18] She came back home after getting so defamed
[11:32] it will take some time, & then everyone will forget it
[11:34] until then take Ramsha's responsibility, spare me & my husband
[11:39] in fact do one thing
[11:41] get her married to your brother-in-law & take her to your house
[11:54] what's with you! Why are you repeating the same thing again & again?
[11:58] say what Faraz?
[12:00] Ask your mother to her along as her daughter-in-law
[12:03] is your immoral & worthless brother capable of it?
[12:19] he had eloped with my sister
[12:22] can he take her responsibility?
[12:30] No, Ramsha cannot get married to Maheer. Besides him...
[12:33] I don't have any other option besides this
[12:37] either sit here & keep an eye on her, or fulfill your responsibility
[12:42] I am going back to my house
[12:44] my marriage is getting ruined because of you guys
[12:46] stop it! you repeat the same thing on daily basis
[12:50] when both of you will not listen to me, then why shall we get insulted?
[13:23] have you seen her stubbornness?
[13:26] she won't change! And you are fighting with me while advocating her
[13:31] and Faraz you!
[13:33] you came here while advocating your brother, right?
[13:35] what's the guarantee?
[13:37] what's the guarantee that both of them will not take any harsh step?
[13:41] they will take some step
[13:51] whatever we have decided is for the betterment of all of us
[13:57] and its right!
[14:00] we shall get Ramsha married
[14:32] Saqlain will take the FIR back once Ramsha gets married
[14:38] and with whom you'll wed her off?
[14:42] there is one acquaintance, Mr. Tauqeer
[14:57] he is quite well off
[15:00] I've met him, in fact Ramsha has also met him
[16:18] what have you decided?
[16:21] Ramsha's wedding..
[16:26] I don't understand anything
[16:29] sister Areeba isn't ready to listen to me
[16:34] and that Taqueer, we don't know anything about him
[16:39] how can we marry Ramsha like this?
[16:42] my position has also become so awkward that I cannot talk to you on this topic
[16:48] even my condition is same
[16:50] and then brother Saqlain, he lies so perfectly!
[16:54] and then sister Areeba! She doesn't understand anything
[16:58] she thinks that the only person who speaks the truth is her husband
[17:04] if we see it from her point of view then...
[17:08] she is on the right track on this matter
[17:13] I cannot take Maheer's guarantee, that whether he'll do any such thing again or not
[17:20] I am feeling so helpless right now
[17:25] what answer will I give to mom after going home? I don't get it
[17:30] she isn't eating or drinking anything properly. Also she isn't taking any medicines
[17:34] what if in all of this...
[17:36] God forbid, something happens to mom
[17:40] what will I do then?
[17:43] don't you worry
[17:46] everything will be fine once Ramsha gets married
[17:52] it means you have agreed for the marriage?
[17:55] I don't have any other option, what shall I do?
[17:58] Ramsha is not ready to listen to me till date. She does whatever she feels like!
[18:05] if I take her responsibility, then what's the guarantee that she'll listen to me in the future?
[18:11] she isn't understanding anything
[18:13] she thinks we aren't thinking for her betterment, as if I am her enemy
[18:18] sister Areeba seems completely convinced
[18:21] She find everything fine except for age difference
[18:27] I cannot say anything about it
[18:28] this proposal is brought by brother Saqlain, & he can never think of our betterment
[18:34] until I don't meet him, that Tauqeer
[18:38] I cannot say anything
[18:40] So, its fine... you can meet him
[18:42] there is no harm in meeting
[18:45] decide for the proposal after meeting him & giving it a thought
[18:49] not under their pressure
[19:02] yes Saqlain
[19:04] yes, what is the matter Areeba?
[19:07] is everything fine?
[19:09] yes, everything is fine. Actually, Mahnoor wants to meet brother Tauqeer
[19:15] by the way, why does she want to meet him? As you have already met him
[19:19] yes, I have met him but Mahnoor wants to meet him too
[19:23] its obvious, if we wed off Ramsha to him then we have to see brother Taqueer's house & so
[19:31] if this is the matter then I shall consider it in this manner that Mahnoor doesn't have any objection with this proposal
[19:37] Mahnoor had an objection, but she is quiet now
[19:42] She had called me. She was saying that she wants to meet brother Taqueer & want to see his house
[19:51] Okay, let me talk to brother Taqueer
[19:53] and... do tell Mahnoor not to talk anything inappropriate over there
[20:03] because I've personal as well as business relations with brother Taqueer
[20:07] he is one very important person of my life
[20:09] So I don't want any foolishness
[20:14] I am compelled because of you, otherwise...
[20:17] don't you worry
[20:18] I will explain Mahnoor before going there, she won't say anything inappropriate over there
[20:25] Okay, I'll tell you after talking to brother Taqueer
[20:28] Okay, bye!
[20:42] Mahnoor wants to meet Mr. Tauqeer
[21:22] you cannot marry me with such a weird & filthy man
[21:27] really! is he weird?
[21:31] as if you were about to marry the prince of Kokaf!
[21:35] the guy with whom you were eloping, do you know his worth?
[21:39] brother Tauqeer is a millionaire
[21:43] he will give you all the luxuries of your life
[21:46] As it is, if a man is elder than a woman then he stays under control
[21:52] believe me, he will take very good care of you
[21:55] keep your useless philosophies to yourself!
[21:59] what do you think? The way you have spent your entire life, I shall also spend in the same manner!
[22:04] if you will argue in front of me, then I will beat you so much
[22:10] don't you feel ashamed?
[22:13] what do you think of yourself?
[22:15] Who are you!
[22:17] you've humiliated me in front of all!
[22:20] in front of my husband, relatives & neighbors
[22:24] everyone is beating drums of your defamation everywhere
[22:29] and you! you don't have some shame!
[22:33] if you had some shame in your eyes, then you wouldn't have argued in front of me
[22:43] one more thing!
[22:44] if you refuse for this marriage then Saqlain will never let Maheer come out of the prison
[22:51] he will rot inside the jail, because of you
[22:55] because we cannot take any risk until you get married
[23:00] you will never get married to Maheer at any cost
[23:04] and this is not just mine but Mahnoor's decision as well!
[23:09] now its your choice, whether you want to take the curses from his mother or not
[23:43] May God destroy him! May all of them be ruined
[23:48] I pray that they get completely destroyed who has trapped my Maheer in a false case
[23:53] what's with you, mom? Why are you continuously cursing?
[23:56] what else shall I do then? You tell me
[24:01] we are facing one problem after another
[24:06] and Maheer, God knows what he saw in that girl
[24:12] he is destroying his future after her
[24:16] what if that wretched Saqlain didn't agree to took back the case, what will happen then?
[24:24] he will face a lot of loss in his studies
[24:27] my son used to get a scholarship
[24:32] God forbid...
[24:35] if this matter reaches to the university, then Aima won't they expel him?
[24:42] I don't know, mom
[24:44] there is a possibility though, I don't know
[24:48] my God... oh God, where shall I go & die?
[24:53] what are you saying, mom?
[24:56] you are saying as if only Maheer is your child, am I no one to you?
[25:01] its been two days that you've been crying for him without eating or drinking anything
[25:06] stop it please, I request you. Stop it mom!
[25:13] No my dear, I do care a lot for you
[25:18] but my heart is sinking because of Maheer
[25:24] and then your mother-in-law
[25:27] She did a weird request
[25:29] if there is no job vacancy in the company, then how will they give him a job?
[25:35] and then Mahnoor, Faraz & Yasir works at the same work place. Not at all!
[25:42] I don't get it, my heart isn't agreeing
[25:47] mom, so what answer you'll give her?
[25:50] I don't know
[25:52] I haven't thought about it as of yet
[25:56] I will take suggestion from Faraz
[25:58] Let Maheer's matter get solved first, and my child shall come back home
[26:03] Okay don't cry, shall I make tea for you?
[26:07] I don't want anything
[26:10] I think brother is here, let me check
[26:15] oh God, please give me some good news
[26:42] get up, have your dinner
[26:48] eat it! don't pretend to be a prince. As you aren't one!
[27:18] Faraz, has Saqlain Agreed?
[27:27] I knew it. I knew it that wretched man will never agree
[27:32] because he got a chance to annoy & avenge us
[27:37] I will try, let me try taking someone's help
[27:44] you people haven't done good
[27:47] you people are doing injustice with us
[28:12] heartiest congratulations to you, brother Tauqeer
[28:15] congratulations on what? You seem so excited
[28:20] just consider your work is done
[28:25] is it done?
[28:27] has Ramsha agreed to get married?
[28:29] almost..
[28:31] but Areeba doesn't have any objection
[28:34] she was quite impressed after meeting you on that day
[28:38] in fact, Areeba & her sister wants to meet you
[28:42] you know its a tradition, also they will be satisfied
[28:48] I had asked you about the house
[28:50] you haven't done that work. You have forgotten it, right?
[28:53] brother Tauqeer, I don't forget or ignore anything
[28:58] it was your order, how come I would have forgotten it?
[29:01] there is a house in my sight, its well-furnished. Also the location is really nice
[29:06] you'll feel good after seeing it
[29:09] but you have to be careful about one thing
[29:13] what is it?
[29:17] I had to lie to Areeba in this case of yours
[29:24] I had said to her that you are single & you don't have any family
[29:28] I couldn't discuss about your wife & children with her
[29:32] So here, you have to keep my word
[29:36] you did a great job!
[29:38] even I don't want this matter to come out
[29:41] neither Ramsha gets to know nor her sisters
[29:47] its fine then, our problem is solved
[29:49] now, if you want...
[29:52] you can come with me, I will show you the location. Its well-furnished
[29:58] I have to appreciate your brain, Saqlain
[30:01] it works like a computer
[30:03] there is a solution of every problem
[30:07] I have never felt proud on it, brother Tauqeer
[30:13] let's go!
come
[30:30] aunty, please have dinner
[30:35] I don't want to eat
[30:39] please don't be stubborn, this way you'll fall sick
[30:43] to hell with you!
[30:46] I will die, right?
[30:48] its good, you'll get rid of your mother-in-law
[30:52] don't say this, may God bless you with my life as well
[30:56] if you will not eat, then you will fall sick & your blood pressure will get highh
[31:01] neither you are eating dinner
[31:04] Nor Faraz has eaten anything, also Aima is not having anything
[31:10] if you will not eat anything, then they'll also stay hungry. Please eat something for their sake
[31:17] don't know whether my Maheer had eaten anything or not
[31:24] he doesn't like anything, he picks issues out of everything!
[31:29] what will he get at the police station?
[31:37] please eat your dinner, then Faraz will go to give dinner to Maheer
[31:43] He will go & request them. At least, they'll let him give the food
[31:48] yes, ok
[31:52] First you & Faraz have dinner, then he'll go to give food to Maheer
[31:59] mom, please have dinner then you have to take your medicine too
[32:02] Maheer will also come back home in a few days
[32:05] they must have beaten him a lot, right Faraz?
[32:10] not much
[32:12] I have requested them not to beat him again
[32:19] I pray to God, it happens this way
[32:27] dear, you also go & have something
[32:30] you are wandering around like this since morning. Besides, you are giving very tough exams
[32:35] go... you also go, my dear
[34:39] So, all of your objections are over or there is still any doubt left?
[34:42] its not the matter of doubts or so
[34:45] I just want Ramsha to get married in a good family
[34:49] with a person who shall take care of her, and she shouldn't feel any pain there
[34:57] so what do you think?
[34:59] isn't brother Tauqeer a gentleman?
[35:02] I didn't mean to say that
[35:04] by the way he looks fine but I don't understand one thing
[35:08] he is quite an aged man, so why he hadn't married as of yet?
[35:13] its his choice..
[35:15] there are a lot of people in this world who doesn't think about getting married
[35:22] Besides, brother Tauqeer is so crazy about his work
[35:26] he had widely expanded his business
[35:33] also he isn't Karachi based, sister Areeba was telling me
[35:37] Umm... No, recently he had shifted here
[35:43] As it is, he roams around entire world
[35:46] He has got such a big business and he is having some work in almost every other country
[35:51] and after marriage our Ramsha will also travel, right?
[35:54] God willing, by the way I am very satisfied
[35:58] he was talking with a lot of respect when we had met earlier
[36:02] and today he was being way too down to earth
[36:06] such a rich & famous person
[36:10] and see, he doesn't have any pride feeling or so
[36:15] who meets in this manner?
[36:18] its not that he has become newly rich. He belongs to a rich family background
[36:22] and family oriented people are not weak
[36:28] he seems to be
[36:29] look, now its the responsibility of you both
[36:31] both of you have to handle Ramsha, what if she creates a chaos while marrying
[36:45] now see, my acquaintance with brother Taqueer is quite old
[36:49] even later, Ramsha has to take care of my honor
[36:53] Still, if there is any problem then end this matter here. Its not a big deal
[36:58] No, don't you worry. I'll look into it
[37:03] Okay
[38:01] what is this misbehavior? Why were you banging the door?
[38:04] are you in your senses!
[38:07] Mahnoor, tell her
[38:10] We have fixed her wedding
