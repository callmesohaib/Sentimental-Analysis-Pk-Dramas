[01:10] Sister!
[01:12] Sister please don't give up!
[01:15] sister Areeba requested her mother so much!
[01:18] You know that these days are important for me.
[01:21] My time is being wasted.
[01:23] Take some notes from your friends and start preparing!
[01:26] This means that you won't help me too?
[01:31] Rimsha! You have grown up now. You are not a child.
[01:35] You have to understand.
[01:37] Anymore fuss will lead to a big fight, and I don't want that.
[01:42] A fight is needed. Sister!
[01:47] If a person wants to live a life according to their wish, they need to take a stand for it.
[01:55] Even if a fight takes place.
[01:59] Sure! Get ready tomorrow. I'll drop you off at the college.
[02:03] I'll not just drop you, but I'll pick you up too!
[02:06] How will you manage this all?
[02:09] You attend your university too, and your office timing is so different.
[02:13] I'll have to manage! It's not such a big deal even if I miss a class.
[02:18] Your education is important!
[02:21] And brother Saqlain has an issue because he thinks negative, and that's why he is creating a fuss!
[02:28] We should not give him a chance to create an issue for us.
[02:34] You are right!
[02:36] But I just hope that brother Saqlain doesn't create any other problem.
[02:42] Go! Bring me a cup of coffee.
[02:45] Sure!
[03:15] Sure!
[03:17] If aunt and Mahnoor are requesting so much then Rimsha can attend her college.
[03:22] But after that I'm not responsible.
[03:27] Mahnoor is responsible!
[03:31] If anything bad happens later!
[03:35] I don't want anyone coming to me while crying.
[03:55] I wanted to visit you guys but you know that I alone have a house to handle,
[04:03] and now that Ashir is not here so I have look after the matters of outside too.
[04:10] You are so lucky that your son in law handles everything for you.
[04:17] I don't force him to do any work of mine because how will he handle so much.
[04:21] Will he handle his house, his office or your house?
[04:26] You are right!
[04:28] I've never left my house because Saqlain has handled all the matters of house so well.
[04:35] Obviously! Saqlain handles the burden.
[04:40] Why do you need to leave the house!
[04:50] Aunty! We also want that brother Saqlain doesn't handle our burden
[04:56] and we don't stress him out from our side.
[05:01] Actually he likes to handle the problems of others himself!
[05:15] Mahnoor! Someone caring decides to handle others problem.
[05:20] When a person has close relations, it's important to look after the relations and solve their problems.
[05:26] The world might blame me
[05:29] for not taking care of my in laws just like my family.
[05:38] Sure! But I think you should not worry about what the world says.
[05:44] Or we might not take a breath on our own tomorrow.
[05:59] Darling! Pass her the juice Areeba!
[06:03] Here! Drink it.
[06:24] Did you see how Mahnoor misbehaved with me in front of aunt?
[06:29] I don't know what's her problem with me.
[06:32] I also didn't like her behavior.
[06:35] I didn't react due to aunts presence.
[06:38] That's why I stopped interfering in the decision of Rimsha's college.
[06:42] If Mahnoor still feels like scolding me in front of everyone,
[06:48] then absolutely I feel like she wants the hold of the property of all you sisters.
[06:55] You should not worry about her.
[06:58] Her opinions have no importance until mother's presence.
[07:03] I won't let her succeed with her wish in any case.
[07:06] I know her mental capacity really well.
[07:09] She cannot handle such matters.
[07:11] It's just a matter of some months.
[07:13] You should tolerate. She'll get married in some time.
[07:17] She'll be busy with her household so she won't interfere in your matters.
[07:24] We'll see.
[07:30] I didn't realize that Mahnoor is so arrogant.
[07:34] She doesn't respect her surroundings! She speaks whatever she has to say.
[07:37] Why? Did she say something to you?
[07:39] No! But she was taunting Saqlain.
[07:46] Really! What were you guys talking about?
[07:49] I was complimenting Saqlain that he cares for the both houses so regularly.
[07:57] But Mahnoor decided to act ungrateful and started saying that Saqlain does everything with his will.
[08:06] Think it yourself! Is it really possible
[08:09] that he is willingly taking the burden off of their hands?
[08:14] Why would I know? There might be some good for him. We don't know the details.
[08:19] Whatever! When you get married to Mahnoor, try to keep her in some limits.
[08:25] I don't want her to do the same here.
[08:28] Sure! I'll keep her in limits. Fine?
[08:35] Leave others! I called you to ask about your health.
[08:40] What about my health? I cannot live without you son. Come back quickly!
[08:48] I just want you to come back and I want to see you in person. Everything will be fine.
[08:56] Goodbye! I'll talk to you later.
[10:26] Here! Eat some sweets.
[10:28] I mean brother Saqlain is enjoying!
[10:33] He buys a new car every year.
[10:37] We just get to eat the sweets!
[10:40] We get happy by eating the sweets, we don't even have a bicycle.
[10:46] Every other day we have to use a taxi.
[10:49] What will we do with a car? Who'll drive?
[10:51] We don't need it as it'll just get rusted outside.
[10:57] I'll drive! Your eldest daughter Mahnoor will drive too! We'll both drive.
[11:03] No need to! There are so many problems.
[11:07] Will Saqlain handle the burden of this too?
[11:11] Sure! He'll happily take responsibility of this too,
[11:16] and after that his relatives will taunt us that he takes our all responsibilities.
[11:22] His relatives are related to you too.
[11:26] And the way you were talking in front of your mother in law!
[11:32] I could judge her face easily that she didn't appreciate it.
[11:36] It's obvious that if I scolded her nephew in front of her, She wouldn't appreciate it.
[11:42] Did you like what she said to you?
[11:45] I'm used to ignoring such stuff. If your father was still around, it would've been the opposite.
[11:52] You can see that Saqlain handles the burden of this house.
[11:56] If someone said something, then what's the point of feeling bad?
[12:00] brother Saqlain just likes to hear the compliments.
[12:04] I mean sister Areeba was enough, but now his aunt is here to interfere too.
[12:09] You keep quite! Be thankful that he didn't deny my request of letting you go to the college.
[12:16] Be careful Rimsha! I don't want to hear a problem.
[12:20] You should not repeat what happened before, understood?
[12:28] Saqlain I've invited you and Areeba because there are only 2 months left in Mahnoor's wedding.
[12:35] These 2 months will pass in just a bit and we have to start with Mahnoor's shopping.
[12:42] Don't worry aunt! I've talked to Ashir and aunt myself. Ashir is reluctant in taking dowry.
[12:49] You know that my aunt already has everything and Ashir is her only son.
[12:58] She might have everything but I won't depart my daughter empty handed from this house, right!
[13:04] I'll send her with whatever I'm capable of.
[13:08] Her father left her so much.
[13:10] As you wish!
[13:13] At least sit down. Sit!
[13:16] Sit down Areeba!
[13:21] If you've a list, then do give it to me.
[13:25] Furniture or whatever it is. I'll order it.
[13:31] Mahnoor will order it herself!
[13:35] Actually she is the one who'll use it so she decided to choose it herself.
[13:40] You can join her too.
[13:46] That's fine!
[13:55] Saqlain! I want you to hand over the two shops of Mahnoor to her.
[14:09] What do you mean?
[14:12] What's the need of handing over the shops to Mahnoor?
[14:16] I've handed over the share of Areeba too!
[14:20] Now that Mahnoor is getting married, so I want to hand over the share to her too!
[14:27] That's fine but what about you guys.
[14:32] I can manage! There are two more shops and also a house on rent.
[14:38] Rimsha and I can easily manage.
[14:42] I don't want to keep the shares as they are a burden to me!
[14:46] God has already blessed me so I want you to hand over Mahnoor her share.
[14:54] Mahnoor has already got more than her share.
[15:03] You remember that when you got Areeba married to me.
[15:07] She was not even properly educated!
[15:09] I got her privately educated and a degree.
[15:15] And you know about the bills of Mahnoor's education every year!
[15:22] Sure son!
[15:24] But getting them educated is our duty!
[15:28] What's the link of property with it?
[15:32] Mother! If Saqlain is saying that we'll give Mahnoor her share later.
[15:37] What's the big deal?
[15:39] Her share isn't going anywhere. It's her property and she'll get it.
[15:45] You've started the same argument by calling us today.
[15:49] We should start getting things sorted for her wedding.
[15:53] What will she choose? What will be the expense for it?
[15:58] It's obvious that he has to handle it.
[16:03] It's fine Areeba! If aunt wants it her way. I can get the papers ready for her.
[16:11] The property can get evaluated and you can give Mahnoor her share!
[16:14] No! We can handle this later. We should worry about her wedding right now.
[16:22] It's not that a person can follow orders so simply.
[16:27] We'll see it later.
[16:33] I didn't know that you called us so urgently to talk about this.
[16:46] I'll get you some tea!
[17:31] Here! See this mother.
[17:38] I wanted to tell you about it before
[17:41] but I was worried that it might affect sister Areeba's relation.
[17:44] It would've hurt you too
[17:48] but I wanted to expose the reality because brother Saqlain would've damaged sister Areeba
[17:52] and us later because we were blindly trusting him.
[17:59] You did well by telling me all this.
[18:03] Whatever Saqlain did for us! I hope it's better for us.
[18:09] Better for us?
[18:11] What's better for us in it?
[18:14] If this all was for us then why didn't we get informed?
[18:17] Some days before he just told that we have to pay tax but its tax free.
[18:22] What's more good in it that he didn't even let us worry about it and handled it himself!
[18:30] Tax would've been taken from us, not him.
[18:35] Hand me over the papers!
[18:36] Mother!
[18:37] Listen to me carefully Mahnoor! Not all the matters get solved emotionally.
[18:42] You have to use your brain too! These millions don't matter to me.
[18:48] Relations matter to me the most!
[18:52] I want that my daughter stays happy with her husband! I don't care about this money.
[18:57] You don't care but I do!
[18:58] For so many years, brother Saqlain is enjoying our money and we cannot even ask him about it.
[19:05] You can see that how cleverly he rejected from giving me my share of the shops because..
[19:09] If you want the property! I can give it to you.
[19:15] I was thinking of giving your share of shops to you,
[19:18] but Mahnoor after this you won't interfere in any matter of this house.
[19:39] Mother! You are wrong about me.
[19:43] If I'm willing on saving something. It's for you and Rimsha!
[19:46] I don't want anything from this house! I don't want a dowry too.
[19:51] You've done so much for me.
[19:54] You've educated me and never stopped me from doing anything but always helped me and supported.
[20:02] Why would I want more from you?
[22:15] Rimsha! Hurry up. It's already so late.
[22:20] Everything is here.
[22:23] Darling!
[22:25] Mahnoor I've talked to Areeba on phone also!
[22:28] She'll come in the evening with Saqlain! She'll take you with her on shopping for your wedding.
[22:35] Sure! But what about my shopping? I also have to buy somethings for her wedding.
[22:41] Let Mahnoor go right now! She has to buy things according to her choice!
[22:45] We still have to arrange the budget for her wedding.
[22:49] Mother I told you already that I don't want dowry. I don't like this foolish stuff.
[22:55] I told you already that you have gave me everything I needed.
[22:58] Darling! Ashir and her mother will feel bad.
[23:01] What will people say about it? How will you justify yourself?
[23:06] No need to justify. People can say whatever they want.
[23:11] I cannot decide my future on their sayings.
[23:15] What did Saqlain say? That Ashir already has everything!
[23:21] What's the need of taking same stuff to the house again.
[23:27] Give that money in charity.
[23:31] We'll go now as we are getting late! Come quick! You are always late.
[23:35] Goodbye!   Goodbye!
[23:39] You visited after so long Saqlain!
[23:42] Yes aunt! I was busy.
[23:46] It's obvious that you are busy with your sister in law's wedding. How will you visit me.
[23:53] Tell me what's going on in your family in laws?
[23:58] Nothing interesting! Mahnoor is busy with her exams and aunt and Areeba go for some shopping!
[24:06] Aren't they collecting Mahnoor's dowry?
[24:11] No! Mahnoor has denied from the dowry.
[24:16] You know that she doesn't like such stuff and does everything according to her wish!
[24:22] It's good that she denied!
[24:25] I was thinking that where would we store the stuff that she'll bring? My house is already full.
[24:32] You know that Ashir isn't a boy who can sleep on bed that's been brought by her wife.
[24:39] Do one thing! Tell your mother in law to give cash instead of the dowry.
[24:45] That cash will be used by her daughter later.
[24:50] Sure! I'll convey your message to her.
[24:54] If you have any other demand, do tell me! I'll convey it too.
[24:58] I'm not demanding. I'm just suggesting this for the problem of the dowry.
[25:05] I wanted to ask that will they give Mahnoor's share before her marriage or after her marriage!
[25:13] Which share?
[25:15] The same share that Areeba got! Nothings hidden from me Saqlain!
[25:21] I know that you got a share of 2 shops from your family in law.
[25:28] Aunt! I didn't demand those shops. It was the handed over to Areeba as her share.
[25:35] Whatever it was! they did good.
[25:39] It's good because after parents pass away. Siblings do fight over the property later,
[25:45] so it's good to hand over everything while you're alive!
[25:48] I also wanted to ask that will Mahnoor's share be equal to Areeba's share? 2 shops like her.
[25:56] Actually you know that Ashir will comeback here. It'll take him sometime to settle.
[26:02] You also know that business is better than a job. 2 shops will help him.
[26:08] He can start a good business in those shops and you know that it's also for Mahnoor!
[26:14] Think about it! Let me grab something for you to eat. Wait!
[26:53] I decided to get Mahnoor married to Ashir so that I can take the share!
[27:02] I believed that they won't be in a greed for something more
[27:08] but they have the eyes on her share.
[27:15] They want the dowry's budget instead, and now properties share too.
[27:22] They only want her because of her property.
[27:36] I should think about it or I might even get myself in a bad circumstance.
[27:54] Who?
[27:55] Greetings! My name is Wasay.
[27:59] I'm here to meet Mahnoor. I work at her office. Is she home?
[28:02] She is here! Come in.
[28:05] Wow! So many clothes. Did you bring something for me?
[28:10] Calm down! You'll get everything too! But first we'll get done with Mahnoor's arrangement, then it'll be your turn.
[28:19] Bring this and that!
[28:21] I know that I'm the youngest and you'll excuse me at the end that there's no money left,
[28:27] so I'll have to wear Mahnoor's dresses.
[28:30] Mother! I'm telling you that I won't wear any old clothes
[28:33] and I want four new dresses. Four dresses!
[28:38] You'll get them!
[28:42] Madam! Somebody came from Mahnoor's office.
[28:45] He has to talk to her about something important. You can look.
[29:03] Greetings aunt!
[29:05] Greetings! Who are you son?
[29:08] What's the important talk that you're gonna have with Mahnoor?
[29:11] Mahnoor has left the office!
[29:13] Aunt I'm Wasay!
[29:21] Hey! What are you doing here?
[29:25] Mahnoor! I've come to meet you.
[29:27] I've called you so many times! You haven't received my phone calls?
[29:31] And now your number is busy too!
[29:36] What's all this Mahnoor?
[29:40] You said that..
[29:42] Listen! She's engaged and getting married next month.
[29:47] So you shouldn't talk to her or meet her.
[29:51] It's better that you leave quick. Leave!
[29:56] Wait sister Areeba! Let me talk.
[30:01] But Mahnoor..
[30:03] Please! I promise that this won't happen again. Please let me talk.
[30:39] Why did you come here? You shouldn't have.
[30:43] You saw that because of you, my mother and sisters are worried.
[30:47] Let me call Saqlain!
[30:49] Areeba wait! Mahnoor is talking!
[30:51] What is she talking about mother?
[30:53] This boy thinks that the house is full of ladies and I can force myself on them if I threat them.
[30:59] Let me teach him a lesson! Saqlain will be enough for him.
[31:04] What happened?
[31:06] Did you really think of him as a gangster who'll threat sister Mahnoor?
[31:11] He loves sister Mahnoor so he'll try to talk to her.
[31:15] Stay quiet! What will he try?
[31:19]  He is here to break Mahnoor's marriage.
[31:21] Don't say that!
[31:25] Mother! I'm right. 
[31:29] Mahnoor is almost married to Ashir.
[31:32] It's not easy to break the relation.
[31:37] I'm right! 
[31:40] Let Saqlain come. He'll talk to this guy face to face 
[31:44] or something bad might happen later.
[31:50] Mahnoor! Tell them that I'm not here to create a problem for you. 
[31:55] I'm just here to talk to you.
[31:58] Why did you come to talk to me? 
[32:00] We cannot talk.
[32:04] I still love you Mahnoor!
[32:09] Love is still trying to find a place.
[32:13] Wasay please! 
[32:17] I think you are forgetting
[32:19]  that I'm almost married.
[32:21] Mahnoor! I cannot live without you! 
[32:25] You decided to leave me so easily.
[32:29] I'm still standing at a point where you had left me.
[32:33] Exactly at the same point! It's been so long.
[32:40] I'm just waiting that a day will come when you'll be mine.
[32:48] Forget about it! I won't ever comeback to you.
[32:56] I've moved on with my life and I want the same for you!
[33:02] I thought the same but I couldn't because your love has trapped me.
[33:18] Mahnoor!
[33:19] What's the point of these talks now! You should have taken the decision before.
[33:23] I did take the decision to marry you!
[33:28]  Mahnoor trust me.
[33:30] I don't want the approval of my parents! Trust me once.
[33:37] That's the problem! I trust you!
[33:43] But I cannot affirm with you because my mother and sisters are my whole world.
[33:50] You know that my mother never stopped me from marrying you!
[33:58] She was just worried! I could see it in her eyes. 
[34:01] I still remember that she said that Mahnoor, 
[34:06] before taking any such action, do think about your sisters.
[34:11] Don't take any such action that your sisters cannot face the world.
[34:19] You still think that I would let my mother down in these circumstances and give people a chance to hurt my mother?
[34:28] This won't happen! 
[34:31] So please go from here and never comeback in my life again.
[34:37] If we accidentally meet each other at someplace, then treat me as a stranger.
[34:50] I've moved on!
[34:55] And I don't want to go back.
[35:02] I'm just requesting you to leave!
[36:01] Wasay would never comeback! 
[36:04] He would never interfere in my life again. I promise!
[36:07] How did he dare to?
[36:10] He came directly to our door.
[36:17] Did you meet him after your engagement too?
[36:20] It might be something like that! It's been some months since her engagement.
[36:26] He still came here.
[36:31] This means that he really felt comfortable.
[36:36] I didn't meet him at all! I told you mother that I went to leave that job. 
[36:42] Wasay had already left that job.
[36:45] I have no relation with him. He was calling me since a long time and i didn't pick his calls. 
[36:50] That's why he came to talk to me directly.
[36:53] You should have received his calls.
[36:56] If you had talked to him, he would've never came here.
[36:59] Why should I talk to him when I don't have any relation with him?
[37:06] You all should know that there's nothing going on between me and Wasay currently.
[37:12] I'm getting scared by just thinking that if Ashir and aunt find out about it. 
[37:20] What will happen?
