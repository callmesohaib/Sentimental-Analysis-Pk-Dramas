[01:20] Mahnoor, I'm going far away from you. 
[01:23] You were right, you have no place for me in your heart.
[01:30] When we met last time I saw...
[01:35] that I wasn't there in your eyes...
[01:41] My heart has been broken...
[01:45] but one thing is sure, Faraz has made his place in your heart.
[01:52] I just want to see you happy.
[02:05] If possible, forgive me...
[02:10] Farewell, Wasay.
[02:31] Ramsha this is your last semester, please complete your degree.
[02:34] I don't want to.
[02:37] Please don't force me, I don't want to go to university.
[02:40] She's gone insane. Make her understand.
[02:45] Don't worry about her, I'll make her understand. Say what's on your mind.
[02:49] How can I not? I'm worried about both of you.
[02:52] I have to leave for Lahore for training and I can't leave you guys alone. I shouldn't go.
[02:57] Mahnoor, you've struggled so much, if you don't go there, after coming so near...
[03:06] then Ramsha and I won't like it at all, right?
[03:10] Sister is right.
[03:12] After working so hard, you should go.
[03:17] What's with us, we'll take care of ourselves. Don't worry.
[03:22] Concentrate on your studies.
[03:50] How are you, sir?
Please, keep sitting.
[03:55] I decided to congratulate you.
[04:00] Thank you, sir.
[04:01] Faraz, you are a hardworking and patient man, and I know your importance.
[04:07] I know how long you've waited to get this position.
[04:11] The best thing is that you've never brown-nosed anyone to sit on this chair.
[04:20] Sir, my wife...
That is something to be proud of...
[04:25] You supported your wife. You were not jealous of her and supported her career.
[04:29] Your contribution is equal to Mahnoor's.
[04:34] Yes sir... I think that the position I'm in...
[04:39] Mahnoor has contributed to it as well.
Good people deserve good people. Wish you the best of luck.
[04:45] I hope that you will keep progressing like this.
[04:50] Yes, definitely.
Tell me, how's Mahnoor and how's her training?
[04:56] She's fine... thank God... you know how tough the training is.
[05:00] Obviously. Please greet her for me.
[05:03] Sure sir...
[05:04] Have a nice day.
You too sir.
[05:26] Ramsha, forget everything like a bad dream.
[05:44] Brother Faraz...
[05:47] is it easy to forget all this?
[05:53] I know...
[05:57] it's very hard, but everything becomes easier when one tries.
[06:02] So much time has passed as well.
[06:12] Ramsha... Mahnoor is very worried because of you.
[06:16] I promised Mahnoor that I will convince you.
[06:21] But...
We should not pay heed to other people's words.
[06:25] Who are these people who will question you?
[06:29] But...
Enough... I will not hear any excuses. I've brought this form.
[06:37] Fill it up and sign them.
[06:51] Brother Faraz...
[06:54] When will sister be back?
[06:58] Next week.
[07:03] And... when will the training be over?
[07:09] The training is for a year.
[07:21] Why don't you ask your sister that?
[07:26] I think that she must not have time, that's why I don't ask her.
[07:36] Yes, she is very busy.
[07:54] Alright, I should get going.
[07:59] If you have anything for me...
[08:03] please call me, I'll be here.
[08:07] So you've finally convinced Ramsha.
[08:17] Yes!
[08:19] She was being stubborn for no reason.
[08:22] Now, her semester is about to start, so prepare for it.
[08:28] Sure.
[08:37] Thank you, Faraz.
[08:42] Mahnoor isn't here, and still, you take such good care of us.
[08:50] There's nothing to thank for.
[08:53] Whether Mahnoor is here or not...
[08:57] I have a relationship with you two, and I must take care of you two.
[09:44] How are you?
[09:46] Wait a minute.
[09:49] Sit down.
[09:52] Was I late?
No, my class just ended.
[09:56] Good.
[10:07] You guys go.
[10:19] How are you, Ramsha?
[10:23] I'm fine...
It makes me happy to see you returning to life.
[10:31] By the way, this is your best decision.
[10:38] My van is here.
[10:41] Bye*
[11:14] He is so cute. Hold your son.
[11:33] If only mother was alive today.
[11:40] She would have been so happy looking at him.
[11:47] Mother is here, with us.
[11:51] Because her prayers are with us.
[12:00] I'm thinking of extending my holiday because I don't feel like going back.
[12:06] I will miss all of you.
[12:11] I think that you should have yourself posted here.
[12:17] All of you miss you here.
[12:23] If only it were in my control. But I will try.
[12:29] I'll miss that little one and all of you.
[12:34] You're fulfilling such a big dream...
[12:38] is that not enough for your happiness?
Your happiness has been fulfilled as well.
[12:44] You always wanted this as well.
[12:47] Now I have to live for him.
And you have to stay happy for him as well.
[12:54] If God is willing.
[12:56] If God is willing.
[13:34] Sister Salma! Sister Areeba where are you guys? Come here!
[13:42] You're back?
Yes, why is it so silence at home?
[13:48] Where's sister Areeba?
She's at the hospital. Sister Mahnoor took her in the morning.
[13:55] Sister Mahnoor? When did she come back? And how's sister Areeba?
[14:00] Thank God everything is fine, by God's good grace you've become an aunt.
[14:05] Really?
Sister Areeba just had a son.
[14:10] Surprisingly, no one told me.
They were calling you, but your phone was switched off.
[14:18] My phone... you know my phone is switched off in classes. It's even switched off right now.
[14:25] I think I should go to the hospital. I'm going there.
[14:29] Sister, at least eat before you leave.
I'll eat when I come back.
[14:47] Brother...
[14:50] I wanted to talk to you, I'll only take two minutes of your time.
Sure, sit down.
[14:57] Sure.
[15:00] Is everything alright?
[15:02] Yes.
[15:06] How's work?
Work is good, I'm about to get a car as well.
[15:14] So, what's the matter?
[15:18] Brother, I wanted you...
[15:22] to talk to mother, about Ramsha and me... I mean...
[15:27] I want her to take my proposal there.
[15:36] Really...
[15:43] Alright... I'll talk to mother...
[15:47] And I'll talk to Mahnoor as well.
[15:50] Sure... thank you.
[15:52] Did you...
[15:55] Is Ramsha interested in marrying you?
[16:00] I don't know... with what face would I have talked to her?
[16:06] Wouldn't it be better if mother takes my proposal to her?
[16:14] I think before that you should ask Ramsha about her opinion.
[16:23] Because for me the most important thing is what Ramsha wants.
[16:28] You know how traumatized she was.
[16:36] It was very hard for us to make her return to university.
[16:43] Ask Ramsha...
[16:47] and I'll convince mother.
[16:53] Sure... alright.
[16:55] Uh... brother...
[16:58] Thank you so much...
No problem. Bless you.
[18:10] Ramsha...
[18:12] Ramsha, I want to talk to you.
[18:18] Ramsha, I want to ask you something.
[18:22] Will...
[18:25] you marry me?
[18:31] I know...
[18:35] I know that I should ask my mother to send a proposal your way but...
[18:41] I wanted to...
[18:44] ask you.
[18:50] Why?
[18:54] Do you feel pity for me?
[19:00] Everything that has happened in my life, you're the reason behind it.
[19:11] And now you want to sympathize with me and marry me.
[19:18] Ramsha, it's not like that.
I don't need...
[19:21] your pity.
[19:27] Ramsha, I love you.
[19:34] And I realized that...
[19:37] when I lost you...
[19:48] I admit that I wronged you...
[19:53] Then I realized that I...
[20:01] love you like a mad person.
[20:16] Ramsha, you made a decision as well. You married a man who wasn't worthy of you...
[20:26] But today, how can this love end?
[20:33] People...
[20:38] have no control over their emotions.
[20:42] What...
[20:44] Can't you forget...
[20:48] all this and be with me?
[23:09] Take him away from here.
Listen to me!
[23:14] What were you trying to do?
[25:02] Are you scared?
[25:08] Whatever happened in your life...
[25:12] forget everything, you don't need to be scared of anything.
[25:27] What happened to me...
[25:32] to sister Mahnoor...
[25:35] to sister Areeba...
[25:39] When...
[25:42] Whenever I think of this...
[25:45] I feel very afraid. What if this marriage of mine...
[25:51] Nothing will happen.
[25:54] There's no need for you to be afraid.
[25:59] Have you seen how happy sister Areeba is with her child? Sister Mahnoor is happy with brother Faraz.
[26:08] Have you not seen it?
[26:11] Ever since brother Faraz came into sister Mahnoor's life...
[26:16] He has removed all sadness from her life.
[26:23] I want to do the same with your life as well.
[26:30] Believe me.
[26:32] I hope you have a little space in your heart for me.
[26:51] Is there or not?
[27:38] If you think of me as your mother, then trust me. I promise you that neither Mahnoor nor anyone else will not meddle in your matters.
[27:47] You've taken this responsibility to ease my burden, that's why no one will ask you any questions. Mahnoor will apologize to you.
[27:55] I'm sorry brother Saqlain, forgive me, I made a mistake.
[27:59] If Mahnoor and Hashir can't get married, then you can keep Areeba with you.
[28:22] In all these years I wasn't able to see your real face.
[28:30] Do you think that Mahnoor is that bad.. that you married her to Faraz.
[28:36] He's a harasser... if you had controlled him from the beginning, he wouldn't have dared to come here with a proposal for you.
[28:44] I was thinking of making you a partner in my family, but for that, you'll have to do something for me. I want to marry your sister-in-law.
[29:02] Now I want you to leave Areeba. How long will I share you with her?
I said that I'll leave her
[29:09] Besides I'm not interested in her...
[29:13] Give me a child soon, so that I have a solid reason to leave her.
[29:18] For the past two years, you've been spending nights out of home. Where were you going?
[29:24] I married for the second time. And that too because you were barren.
I'm not barren, and I'm not without hope as well.
[32:23] Time passes by, sometimes with happiness... and sometimes without any control...
[32:30] But if you weren't here, what would be here? Only sadness, not happiness.
[32:45] People have gone by, some strangers, some not.
[32:48] They became like ashes...
[32:52] But you always remained with me... you've become my trust and destiny.
[33:01] As the sunsets into the Earth...
[33:09] Now it will give rise to a new era...
[33:17] And that new era is you.
[33:32] It seems that this was a long travel.
[33:41] It was long and hard.
[33:44] But you were with me, that's why I didn't realize the fatigue of the journey.
[33:55] I miss you a lot.
[34:04] I'm at the same office every day, where I have countless memories.
[34:10] I pray that time flies back and you return as soon as possible.
[34:21] Your holidays end so quickly. Time flies past...
[34:29] in a flash.
[34:32] But still...
[34:35] I'm sure you don't miss me, as much as I miss you.
[34:40] I count the days as they pass.
[34:44] I think about when I'll come back home.
[34:48] And then we'll be together again.
[34:54] That's what I wait for as well. I'm very excited.
[35:02] People say that a woman is behind a man's success.
[35:09] But I think that I'm the first woman on this Earth...
[35:13] who has her husband's hand behind her success?
[35:21] You've always stood by me...
[35:24] You've removed the hurdles from my path.
[35:28] The position I'm in today is only because of you.
[35:39] If you weren't with me, I wouldn't be in this place.
[35:47] When will you stop doing that?
[35:52] Love, sadness... responsibilities, everything is shared.
[35:59] Promise me one thing...
[36:02] You will stay with me like this like you have up till now.
[36:38] There will come days when we'll be far away...
[36:45] Days where love won't be enough...
[36:49] But I promise you, that we'll always be together.
[36:57] Together.
