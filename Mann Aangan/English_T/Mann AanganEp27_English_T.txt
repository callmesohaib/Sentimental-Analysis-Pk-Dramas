[01:15] Saqlain knows all of mother's medical history and he's the one who always takes mother to the hospital.
[01:21] I'm sure Saqlain must have been satisfied by what the doctor said. Since that day mother has been feeling well too.
[01:41] Don't worry... it's not such a big deal nowadays.
[01:50] The medical field has become so advanced that installing stents has become an easy process
[01:57] You don't understand. I'm worried about something else.
[02:07] I don't understand why brother Saqlain lied.
[02:13] It isn't possible that the doctor didn't discuss with him in detail about what happened to mother. Still, he lied to us.
[02:22] Brother Saqlain didn't lie to you...
[02:27] That night I talked to the doctor in secret. Brother Saqlain told me that there was a blockage in the arteries...
[02:39] but brother Saqlain said that...
[02:42] the medicine will cure everything and...
Mother's consultant is avoiding everything...
[02:49] Every doctor has their own way of treatment.
[02:55] So, what should I do now? What would you have done if you were in my place?
[03:04] I would have taken a second opinion from another doctor. If that doctor had advised surgery, then I wouldn't lose a moment in agreeing.
[03:13] Because my father was late...
[03:20] He hid his pain from us.
[03:28] The disease spread so much...
[03:31] that we didn't get the chance to get him treated.
[05:04] Who are you talking to?
[05:07] That was... she's a friend of mine.
Is this any time to talk to a friend? Who's this friend of yours?
[05:17] She's my university friend. She's a very good friend of mine.
I'm sure you must meet her at university then...
[05:28] When you get to meet her during the day, why are you talking to her in the middle of the night?
[05:38] Now I understand why my mother's health has declined after Mahnoor's marriage.
[05:46] Saqlain is completely right about you. Your attention goes to unnecessary things.
[05:53] You didn't take care of mother at all.
[05:58] Shut off the lights and go to sleep. I don't want to see you talking on the phone again.
[06:10] She's restless as well.
[06:14] She's come into our home and become a dictator. How many things will she restrict me from doing?
[06:23] She's driving me insane? One can't have a moment's peace in this house.
[06:57] Are you happy now? I think by now all of your complaints must be gone.
[07:04] We were together for a week and during that week I didn't talk to Areeba once.
[07:10] Did you do a favor by doing that? I'm your wife and it's your responsibility to keep me happy.
[07:19] To make you happy I can offer up my life as well.
Your life is very dear to me and I don't want that.
[07:27] Look at this diamond necklace, I want this. It is a little expensive, but I hope its price won't bother you.
[07:39] No, it's not that expensive. You'll get it, anything else?
[07:45] Nothing... for now, I just want this.
Alright... let me visit home.
[07:52] You're in quite a rush to meet Areeba.
[07:57] You know that I don't even want to see her face, but I'm compelled to.
[08:05] I can understand your compulsion, that's why I'm letting you go.
[08:12] I should get going now...
Okay bye!
[08:20] What's the problem? Why do you look so worried?
This is something to worry about.
[08:26] He knows that we live here.
Who?
[08:31] Rameez?
Yes... after you left, he's come around here two times.
[08:36] Who gave him the address to this place?
I don't know.
[08:43] If Saqlain finds out about this, he'll bury me alive.
[08:49] We'll see what happens, let's take these bags inside and open them up.
[09:02] Show me this one.
[09:06] Sister, how do you understand these books? These look very complicated.
[09:11] After your exams, I'll give you some books to read. They are more interesting than the digest you read.
[09:19] Tell me, how are your exams going?
[09:25] Just fine.
[09:28] Why are you so upset? Are they not going well?
[09:34] They are going just fine. After exams are over, college will be over too, and I'll have to stay home.
[09:43] Why is that? Don't you have any intentions of furthering your studies?
[09:47] I do... but mother has no interest in it. She just wants to get me married. She wouldn't even let me take the exams if she had found a match.
[09:57] Why is your mother in such a rush to get married? After you complete your studies...
[10:04] you can get married.
Do you know that as every day passes you're becoming my ideal?
[10:09] I just want to become like you. I want to be independent, strong... educated...
[10:16] You have a destination set in your mind. What I have to do is do kitchen work and then wash clothes. I'll continue doing that after I get married.
[10:25] Look... marriage is necessary for life. I want you to get married, have a home, and lead a good life.
[10:34] But before that, you need to do something for yourself as well.
[10:39] Sister, talk to brother about this. Mother called my aunt to check for proposals on my behalf.
[10:49] Auntie doesn't listen to me.
[10:53] Where did you get this book from? I want this one.
[11:12] How have you been doing?
I'm well, thanks to God.
[11:17] Congratulations that you got Faraz married.
Thank you.
[11:22] But it's disappointing that you didn't call me.
It all happened in such a rush.
[11:32] It's good that you got Faraz married. Otherwise, my shoes had lost their soles in search of a match for him.
[11:40] Didn't the daughter-in-law bring new furniture with her? Now that I look at it, the sofas seem old to me as well.
[11:50] You said that they were wealthy people.
Yes, they are, but I refused a dowry.
[11:59] You tell me, are you looking for a proposal for Aima, or are you still searching?
[12:06] I started off proposals for Aima not once, but twice. By now I would have gotten her married...
[12:12] if that thing hadn't happened.
[12:19] Greetings*
You're back early today.
[12:25] Yes... I went on a site visit. There wasn't much to do at work today, so I came back home.
[12:33] Mahnoor, is that you?
[12:42] Yes... how are you, auntie?
I'm well, thanks to God.
[12:50] You know her...
Yes... I visit their home often.
[12:57] I met with your mother a few days ago. She was very happy.
[13:02] It's good that you married Faraz...
[13:07] Your divorce had wilted your mother.
[13:35] What did you say? Divorce?
Did you not know?
[13:43] She was married?
She wasn't married, she just had the marriage ceremony.
[13:48] The cursed man divorced her two days before she was set to leave her home.
[14:08] I'm happy that Mahnoor and Faraz got married. Both of them have a home now.
[14:53] Yes, mother, you asked me here? Did you want to ask me something?
I can't believe it, Faraz.
[14:59] A great truth has been unveiled to us and you're not angry at all?
[15:11] Because I knew this.
What?
[15:16] You knew this, then why didn't you tell me?
[15:21] Because it makes no difference to me.
Why doesn't it? What do you mean by that?
[15:25] She's a divorcee and...
It's not a crime to be a divorcee.
[15:30] It is not, but Mahnoor...
Mahnoor was not at fault for what happened. She is the victim.
[15:35] How is it not her fault? I just talked to Shakeela a few moments ago and she told me that her ex-husband divorced her...
[15:45] because she had an affair with someone and she didn't want to marry him.
[15:57] Mother... you shouldn't focus on rumors. Not every rumor is true.
[16:04] Why would Shakeela lie to me? Tell me, why would she lie to me?
[16:10] She tried to marry her to someone. Her disgraceful tales are infamous in her neighborhood.
[16:21] That's why she wasn't getting married.
Enough mother, don't ever repeat this.
[16:28] Mahnoor is my wife and I will not hear anything bad about her.
[16:44] The neighbors say a lot about me as well. And you're a witness that I was filed with a police case.
[16:50] But... forget about raising a hand on that girl, I didn't even talk to her in a loud tone.
[16:56] But what everyone says...
I'm a witness that you were not cruel to that girl and you didn't embarrass me.
[17:06] But how can I be a witness to someone else's character?
[17:15] That too of a person who I've only known for a few weeks. I don't know what she did in her past.
[17:22] Mother!
[17:37] Now I realize why her brother-in-law was so irritated by us.
[17:45] Saqlain got her married in his family.
[17:51] And because of her, the marriage was broken. Mahnoor humiliated him and now he's humiliating us!
[18:18] He has been blinded!
[18:43] It's my fault.
[18:55] I never told mother anything about you, because this didn't matter to me...
It's alright.
[19:06] For her, this is something huge.
It wouldn't have been if it wasn't exaggerated to her.
[19:20] I apologize to you on my mother's behalf.
[19:37] Please... don't feel bad.
[19:44] I can't see you like this.
[19:47] I feel pain...
[19:51] when you feel pain.
How come you trust me so much?
[19:58] You didn't know the truth as well.
[20:02] Still, you took a stand for me in front of your mother.
[20:11] It's exactly like how you trust me.
[20:18] Mahnoor, I have enough sense in me to distinguish between lies and the truth.
[20:28] It has become a way of ours that whenever we see an independent and strong woman we start picking apart her character.
[20:40] In our society, this has become very prevalent. We don't think...
[20:45] that accusing someone is a major sin.
[20:59] Mahnoor, please forget all of these things... I'm honestly very embarrassed.
[21:10] If I had shared this with mother earlier, then this wouldn't have happened today.
[21:17] I'm really sorry.
[21:33] Why are you crying?
[21:39] It's nothing.
[21:42] I just remembered some harsh moments from my life.
[22:40] How was your time without me?
[22:47] It was good... but I missed you.
[22:51] Why would you have missed me? It had been so long since we went to stay at your home.
[22:57] I'm sure you three must-have partied.
[22:59] No, nothing special. You know Mahnoor stays busy at work all day.
[23:06] And Ramsha spends half her day at university...
Yes, she has to earn and pay her in-laws' bills.
[23:18] Anyways, how's auntie feeling? I was so busy with work that I forgot to ask about her.
[23:25] Shall I ask you something?
Sure, what is it?
[23:36] Is mother really well?
[23:47] Mahnoor and Faraz met with a different specialist and he said that...
[23:54] mother should have her surgery as soon as possible. The medicine can't treat her.
[23:59] Did he say that in front of auntie?
[24:02] No, he didn't say it in front of mother. We were sitting together...
[24:08] Thank God... that auntie doesn't know about this.
[24:14] That's what I expect from those fools. Auntie will surely be operated on...
[24:19] If not today, then tomorrow... if not now, then maybe in a few months.
[24:24] When she is mentally prepared for it.
[24:28] Then why didn't you tell me this? I was shocked at how there can be two different things said on the same report.
[24:38] Areeba you know I think before I speak.
[24:44] Did you three take a look at yourselves back when that happened? I didn't think it was appropriate to tell you guys about this.
[24:54] Besides... I was very occupied because of work. I needed to go to Turkey because of my business.
[25:00] I decided that I would talk to you all about it when I come back.
[25:05] But I don't know what rush Mahnoor and Faraz were in.
[25:08] Poor Faraz took Mahnoor to the specialist to calm her down...
When did he become 'poor Faraz'?
[25:17] He is a sly man and I want you to be cautious.
[25:24] Mahnoor has always been naive and emotional.
[25:28] And Faraz has entrapped her.
[25:32] Faraz doesn't seem that way to me.
[25:38] You can't judge him based on his appearance.
[25:44] I meet such people in my line of work every day. They say something, think something else, and do something completely different.
[25:53] People like him are very sly.
[25:57] You'll see that Faraz's family will steal everything away from Mahnoor.
[26:02] And they won't be able to do a thing about it. That's why I'm asking you to be cautious.
[26:30] Look at my luck. The first daughter-in-law I brought destroyed our reputation...
[26:40] the second time I married my son, his wife's deeds humiliated him in front of the entire world.
[26:49] What has she done that you make an issue over every trivial thing?
[26:55] Who said that is infamous? She's educated...
[27:01] she has an officer's post.
[27:05] She's right, for the first time in our lives... What's wrong with sister Mahnoor?
[27:12] She's from a good family and she earns well. You should be grateful.
[27:20] All of this has happened because of you. You are the one who convinced me into making this union.
[27:28] Really... you're saying that like that bother Faraz would have listened to you if you had refused.
[27:39] I was prideful in front of Shakeela.
[27:44] I told her that I found a match for Faraz that was a thousand times better than the ones she had brought for him.
[27:51] And look what I brought home.
[27:59] Anyways... I will keep her in her place. 
[28:09] How dare he defend his wife? He has half forgotten his mother.
[28:17] He has gotten out of my hand. Pass this thread through the needle.
[30:14] Greetings.
[30:16] Greetings to you too.
Shall I make you tea?
[30:19] No. Make it after a while.
[30:22] Close this up and start the washing machine.
Pardon?
[30:29] Why are you so surprised? It's not like I'm speaking in tongues...
No...
[30:35] I mean... so early in the morning? I have to go to work, I'll come back and wash the clothes.
[30:42] There will be a lot to do when you come back home. Aima is having her papers and you could be needed.
[30:50] There is so much laundry.
[30:55] I'll wash it myself.
No auntie, I'll wash it.
[31:30] Mahnoor...
Yes?
[31:34] These are some more clothes, they were in Mahir's room. Wash them as well.
[31:40] Be careful... why don't you wash them with your hands.
[31:48] He will get angry if his clothes get ruined.
Don't worry, I'll wash them by hand.
[32:31] Thanks for dropping me off. You must be running late because of me.
[32:35] Uh.. no, not at all... the party would be just starting now.
[32:43] I think I am running late. I should get going, bye!
[33:05] Where were you?
I was doing the laundry.
[33:11] So early in the morning?
Yes...
[33:16] Sorry...
[33:18] Are you feeling well?
It's just a minor flu.
[33:25] May I?
[33:30] You have a fever. Please sit down here.
[33:38] I think you've got a fever because you did the laundry so early in the morning.
[33:42] No... I wasn't feeling well since last evening. It's just a flu.
[33:47] The weather is changing. The wind is cold... why did you do the laundry today?
[33:54] If I don't do these things, then who will?
[33:58] Aima is preparing for her exams, auntie can't do such things anymore...
[34:04] that's why I decided to do them.
[34:09] I think we should hire a maid.
[34:12] I'll talk to mother about it.
No please don't. If you do, she'll think that you're saying this for me.
[34:23] Look... you're only burdened by your job. On top of that, you have your exams as well. If you add house chores to this...
[34:32] It's not a problem... I will manage to do all of them...
[34:38] Ever since I've come here, I've been trying to cut the distance between you and your mother.
[34:45] Whatever indifference she has for me in her heart, I just want to drive it away.
[34:51] Please... don't come in between me and your mother.
[34:58] I... am not that weak. I can take care of myself.
[35:04] I'm only silent because I don't...
[35:09] want there to be any strain in any relationship.
[35:13] You're completely right about that. You are very strong.
[35:17] Sit down here, I'll make breakfast for you. Please relax.
[35:35] Who was that guy? Don't lie to us! We saw you coming in with him.
[35:48] Why are you silent, why aren't you speaking up?
[35:53] Mother...
[35:59] Speak... does he speak with you in university? Were you speaking with him that night?
[36:13] Do you have an affair with him?
Areeba...
[36:26] Ramsha, I'm disappointed that you've done everything that Mahnoor did.
[36:37] We sent you to university to study. The disappointing thing is that you learned nothing from Mahnoor's life.
[36:52] Such friendships in university are nothing but time pass.
[36:58] Those guys lose nothing, but girls like you lose their reputation.
[37:09] Mother...
[37:11] Find a good match for her and get her married immediately.
[37:24] She won't go to university anymore. She'll stay at home.
[37:29] Sister, it's not like how you think it is. You have it wrong.
You don't go to university to study...
[37:36] I know why you go there and I won't let you succeed.
Alright enough. Don't take so much stress.
[37:44] Don't we have enough tension?
[37:53] Auntie sit down, you too.
[37:57] Go and bring water for them both. Go!
[38:10] I can't believe that Ramsha...
Don't worry...
[38:13] I'll sort this out.
There's nothing to sort out. Find a match for him and marry her off.
[38:19] Alright, we'll find a match for her as well.
[38:23] Auntie, where's Mahnoor? She hasn't come here yet. I asked you to call her here because I wanted to talk about something important.
[38:28] I asked her to come here but she wasn't well today.
[38:34] I called her, she was sick. She didn't even go to work today
[38:41] They are cruel to her.
[38:47] She goes to work and I'm sure she looks after the home as well. I can't believe the type of people there are in the world.
[38:55] I could never imagine taking a share of my wife's salary.
[39:13] Where's the water?!
