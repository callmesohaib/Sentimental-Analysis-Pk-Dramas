[01:02] Brother Saqlain, have this sweet. You haven't had it
[01:07] I'll have it if you'll insist but what is it for?
[01:12] Sister has got a commercial manager job in a big company
[01:26] What?
[01:27] yes! Its a renowned company.
[01:31] When they saw sister's hard-work and dedication, they immediately offered sister a managerial position.
[01:41] Wow! Many congratulations!
[01:45] Thank you brother Saqlain
[01:46] You have started flying leaving the house
[01:49] Its just the start. Real achievement would be when I have handled everything well.
[01:56] For now they have kept me on 3 month probation period. Job will be permanent after that
[02:04] Mother, you didn't even tell me
[02:08] If we hadn't come today, we won't have found out
[02:11] No my child, I was going to tell you. When Saqlain called and said that you are coming here ..
[02:19] Then I thought to tell you once you are here
[02:27] What has happened to you?
[02:29] Why are you complaining about the past. Leave it. We should be happy for Mahnoor
[02:37] After all, this is first achievement of her life
[02:41] We all went through a lot of pain in last few days.
[02:45] Mahnoor has suffered the most
[02:50] We should be happy for her. You too. Infact, we all should celebrate it today
[02:57] I was saying the exact thing to sister Mahnoor to give us treat. She has got the job
[03:03] Take it from her when her job would be permanent. Today, I will take you all out
[03:08] Hey!
[03:11] what you?
[03:12] can't I give treat?
[03:14] Get ready everyone quickly. We'll go outside and have a nice dinner
[03:23] Auntie you too get ready
[03:26] Umm .. I?
[03:28] Look, I won't listen to anything else. I have told you all that we will go together and have a nice dinner
[03:35] fine?
[03:35] hmm
[03:36] now go get ready
[03:38] At least take tea
[05:10] Come my child, we are getting late
[05:15] Where is this Ramsha? Come quickly. Bring my shawl too
[05:23] Shall we go?
[05:24] Be quick
[05:56] I don't trust it.
[05:58] He is the same brother Saqlain who had problems all the time. Today he is celebrating your achievement.
[06:53] Mother, do pray for me
[06:56] My child, all my prayers are for you both.
[07:00] May God make things easy for you.
[07:04] Do pray that may God keep me strong
[07:07] Success can be achieved after getting out of these troubles.
[07:10] I want to overcome all my troubles
[07:14] May God give you strength and courage
[07:18] Thank you mother! I'll leave now.
[07:22] And Ramsha fill the forms I have kept so that your university matter can be solved
[07:26] fine!
[07:27] bye!
[07:28] bye!
[07:39] Close the gate
[07:41] You go, I'll do it
[08:34] Hello sir!
[08:34] Come in, have a seat
[08:37] Thank you!
[08:39] This is for the first time that we hired a female on a senior position in our office.
[08:46] After all, women work so hard and take education. They deserve it
[08:52] Isn't it?
[08:53] Absolutely! Usually companies don't consider women for managerial roles
[08:56] because they think that they stay busy at house chores.
[08:59] And they can't handle the stress
[09:03] On top of that, they get married.
[09:07] Absolutely!
[09:08] Well sir, I think we should change this stereotype thinking.
[09:12] Otherwise, even a man is not free from responsibilities of a family
[09:16] Then why should kitchen be a hurdle between a woman's success.
[09:20] Anyways, I think its a separate debate.
[09:24] You are absolutely right, Ms Mahnoor
[09:27] Assistant manager of department will assist you
[09:30] and share details of all the on-going projects
[09:33] sure sir!
[09:34] Beenish please, show Ms. Mahnoor her room. Thank you!
[10:43] come in
[10:49] Greetings
[10:50] Greetings
[10:52] My name is Faraz
[10:53] Oh! Are you staff head of commercial department, right?
[10:57] yes, and you are department head?
[11:01] I was waiting for you. Please have a seat
[11:04] Thanks!
[11:09] Sorry madam, I got a little late today. I had some work
[11:13] Its okay! I hope everything is alright
[11:15] yes!
[11:16] Actually my mother wasn't well. She's diabetic
[11:22] Oh! I see .. May God give her health
[11:25] Amen! Thank you
[11:27] Mr. Faraz, Mr. Ahmed has transferred me this file for quotation
[11:32] yes, I do have the hard copy
[11:35] Can I see?
[11:36] sure!
[11:51] Hey careful! Careful
[11:54] Sir, I'll clean it up
[11:56] Thank you!
[12:01] Thank you! I'll join you in some time
[12:05] Right!
[12:36] Rizwan, check this file. I find something missing
[12:42] what?
[12:43] Did you notice something?
[12:46] He tried impressing boss as soon as he came
[12:50] When boss would find out his reality, then it will be wasted
[12:55] whatever it is. But he did impress
[13:05] Greetings
[13:06] Greetings!
[13:10] Fine, I will ..
[13:10] Isn't it burnt too much?
[13:12] No madam, not much. It will be fine in some days.
[13:16] Are you sure?
[13:18] Anyways, thanks a lot. To keep me safe you burnt yourself.
[13:24] no madam, someone else would have done the same.
[13:28] that's very kind
[13:31] madam, I'm taking out some reports. I will visit you in 5 to 10 minutes
[13:36] sure, take your time
[13:50] See, I told you that he has impressed her
[13:55] if this is how girls are impressed then his previous girl friends would have stayed. He had 4 of them.
[14:15] No, I won't let this thing go so easily.
[14:24] I should create some chaos and humiliation.
[14:29] So that the misconception Mahnoor has created about me would fade away
[14:39] I wanted to see Mahnoor crying and defeated
[14:45] so that I could take revenge of my insult.
[14:49] Anyways, she has been insulted a lot.
[14:55] But now she's busy in her work
[14:58] Even then she won't stop creating hurdles for me, then I'd see her
[15:41] Aima? Aima?
[15:52] What happened mother? What did they say?
[15:56] They didn't answer but directly refused
[16:02] what? They refused too? but why?
[16:07] yes
[16:09] when they left our house, they asked around the neighborhood.
[16:14] Then they refused saying that
[16:17] there must be some truth regarding stories of our boy
[16:24] When everything is false.
[16:26] Someone should ask us
[16:30] May God teach that woman a lesson.
[16:33] She didn't come with the intention of making a house.
[16:36] But destroyed reputation of my son before leaving
[16:41] its been a year that we have been looking for proposals.
[16:53] People consider men wrong. It is him who is wrong
[16:59] How do we prove that our Faraz wasn't at fault
[17:08] Bring water
[17:16] No, I read it in that letter. It was really him
[17:23] You said that he comes after Kiran
[17:28] How would I know?
[17:30] Thankfully, I got that letter.
[17:33] If brother Saqlain had got it instead of me then there would be chaos
[17:40] Don't you remember when brother Saqlain stopped me from coming to college after he saw him?
[17:46] If he hadn't come to know that it was Kiran he was after then he would have stopped my university admission too
[17:57] Don't you know him?
[18:01] I'm feeling very anxious
[18:06] wow mother, tea is great
[18:09] how was your day?
[18:12] It was good
[18:14] you must be tired
[18:16] no, how can I get tired of sitting on a chair?
[18:20] Also, I used to stay out for this much time even before
[18:23] my child, if the responsibility is big it does make a person tired mentally.
[18:29] I'm fine. Where is Ramsha?
[18:34] I asked her to help you. Did she?
[18:40] She hasn't even left her room since morning.
She didn't even show me her face let alone help
[18:46] I told her. Let me ask her. Ramsha? Ramsha?
[18:53] Here she is. Now ask her
[18:55] What is mother saying? I asked you to help mother with house chores.
[19:00] Mother is saying that you didn't even leave the room. Why?
[19:09] What is it? Why do you look like this?
[19:14] She looks like this always
[19:18] Actually, I was having head ache. So I took medicine and slept
[19:25] Tell me have you filled your admission form?
[19:28] I have
[19:33] Will I get admission?
[19:36] Why not? You got such good marks. You will definitely get admission
[19:45] I wish this is what happens
[19:46] Mother, tell me what to make for dinner?
[19:49] My child, you must be tired. I and Salma would handle it
[19:52] I'm not tired. You handle all the chores the whole day and work.
[19:57] I'm here now. Let me handle my responsibility
[20:01] I'm taking it because you made a delicious tea. I'll change and go to kitchen
[21:00] O brother Faraz? When did you come?
[21:03] Just now
[21:05] I didn't even know it. What happened to your hand?
[21:10] Nothing. Tea spilled on me in office
[21:14] Its burnt a lot. Did you put ointment?
[21:17] Yes I did. Its fine. Tell me, did you check mother's sugar?
[21:25] Sugar is normal
[21:28] How is she feeling today?
[21:30] She is fine. But she has taken stress again because of what auntie Shakeela said.
[21:35] I'm worried if she'd get sick again.
[21:41] Mother is strange. She is after one thing.
[21:45] If she wants to look for proposal of someone, it should be you.
[21:48] Ask her to find for you
[21:51] So that we'll get you married once you have completed your graduation
[21:55] You will also get married, tomorrow if not today. You won't stay alone the whole life
[22:02] It isn't that difficult.
[22:04] Also, after the bad experience I have gone through, it isn't easy for me to trust someone
[22:14] Ask mother to stop worrying about me. I'm satisfied with life
[22:20] I don't care what someone says or thinks about me
[22:33] Shall I put these clothes? I have pressed them
[22:35] Yes! Thanks
[22:37] you're welcome
[23:16] Hey be careful! Careful
[23:19] I'll clean it just now
[23:49] what is it Ramsha? You look upset
[23:55] No, I'm fine.
[24:00] Tell me truly. Don't tell a lie
[24:02] No, there is nothing
[24:15] Look, you get caught when you lie. Tell me what it is. I'm your sister. You can share it with me
[24:25] umm
[24:28] Tell me what happened?
[24:29] That guy used to only follow me earlier. Now he comes after me
[25:33] What is it?
[25:34] Nothing!
[25:37] Why are you being nervous? I'm not hitting you. Just asking
[25:43] Nothing! I was just looking
[25:46] I saw you the other day following Ramsha's van
[25:56] Do you like Ramsha?
[25:59] yes .. umm
[26:01] I did read your letter. Your writing is really bad
[26:09] Girls are impressed more by what you show them. Next time if you write a letter, focus more on your writing.
[26:43] Auntie, I was leaving so I thought to give you the rent
[26:47] If you have made grocery listen then give it to me
[26:51] yes I ..
[26:55] Greetings!
[26:56] Mahnoor, you are at home? I thought you must be in office
[26:59] I come back home by 6
[27:02] By the way, how is your job going? When are they giving you a car?
[27:10] you get a car after being permanent. Its my probation period going on right now
[27:16] By the way, if you need anything tell me without hesitation. 
[27:21] Although I know that you don't consider me trustworthy
[27:28] there is nothing like that, Saqlain. She doesn't think this way
[27:35] No auntie, I made a mistake regarding Mahnoor. 
[27:41] I was wrong about Ashir
[27:46] Anyways, whats done is done. I am happy that Mahnoor handled herself really well
[27:56] She didn't get obsessed with her divorce
[27:59] I'd be sad if I had gotten married to a person who was selfish
[28:08] But I'm thankful to God that I didn't get married to such cheap person
[28:13] who stooped so low only to take revenge from me.
[28:21] Even if I had got married to such man, I wouldn't be able to spend my life with him
[28:31] In coming time, I wish you get a selfless and open heart person
[28:37] who would accept your divorce as well
[28:40] and your mental state would match
[28:51] Auntie, give me the grocery list.
[28:55] Yes I will. Have tea
[28:57] yes!
[29:34] Is everything okay?
[29:38] yes!
[29:39] Then why do you look stressed?
[29:42] No, I'm not stressed
[29:46] Your face expressions are telling that you are worried. 
[29:49] What are you doing here?
[29:52] umm .. mother said that the gate is opened. I came to close the gate.
[29:58] Ask auntie not to give you responsibility of opening and closing the gate
[30:04] it doesn't look good when you come to gate. 
[30:07] Girls from decent families belong inside a house
[30:12] otherwise, people talk. The way they talked about your sister Mahnoor
[30:52] What rubbish is written?
[30:55] He is such a disgusting person
[31:00] I'm too scared
[31:02] Why are you scared? It isn't your fault
[31:06] It wasn't my fault before and it isn't right now. I'm scared about brother Saqlain. 
[31:12] Earlier he followed my van and brother made a fuss out of it. 
[31:16] Now he has come to home
[31:20] Ramsha, do you know this guy?
[31:25] I mean where does he live and what does he do? You can share
[31:29] No sister, how would I know?
[31:33] I don't know about him. 
[31:36] We friends stay busy with each other. I have never focused on him. I don't know
[31:41] Fine, its okay. Everything will be alright. 
[31:46] Do not inform this to mother. 
[31:49] You know that she directly discusses everything with brother Saqlain and he's get an excuse of blaming us
[31:59] I don't want him to get an excuse
[32:02] you get it?
[32:04] yes, there shouldn't be a problem in my university admission
[32:10] Its okay. Nothing would happen. I trust you completely. You can't do anything
[32:33] Hey? Listen
[32:41] what happened?
[32:42] Have you heard something?
[32:43] about what?
[32:45] about our new boss.
[32:46] No, is it something special?
[32:48] special?
[32:50] its an internal news that has spread in the market these days
[32:55] then tell me? why are you creating suspense?
[32:58] I'll tell you because you are forcing
[33:01] Madam Mahnoor got divorced before two days of her wedding.
[33:07]  I also heard that she got divorced because of her old lover 
[33:12] who had left her and went outside
[33:15] No way, she doesn't look like it
[33:19] you can't guess the character by looks
[33:21] that right though
[33:24] what rubbish are you saying?
[33:33] Madam Mahnoor is our boss. It is your duty to respect her
[33:42] It isn't our concern what is going on in their life
[33:47] How can it be not? A person's character is judged by his personal affairs. 
[33:51] A woman has been made our head who has such ..
[33:56] Faraz?
[34:01] I asked for a file
[34:04] yes madam, file is ready. I was bringing it to you.
[34:09] Give it to me
[34:11] Thank you!
[34:19] I want rates and comparable rates of raw material in 10 minutes.
[34:25]  I want to get the approval today
[34:28] Yes madam, I'm working on it
[34:31] You go to your room. I'm sharing it with you in 10 minutes
[34:36] good!
[34:38] One more thing
[34:48] If you want to gossip about me, do it on my face. 
[34:52] I don't have a problem. That way, I can answer you. 
[34:57] But if you would character assassinate me 
[35:05] and won't focus on your work, then it can be a problem for you
[35:18] You know what I mean? I hope you understand
[35:23] Yes madam
[35:32] Excuse me madam, give me this file. I have to add some more papers
[35:36] Bring it in my office then
[35:37] sure madam
[36:11] A person's character is judged by his personal affairs. 
[36:14] A woman has been made our head who has such ..
[36:43] What are you both looking at? Finish your work quickly. 
[36:49] Do you have an idea, what if madam complains about you both to the GM,
[36:54]  I would also be answerable.
[36:59] Finish your work quickly
[37:03] I heard that she got divorced two days before her wedding 
[37:06] and that too because of her lover who had left the country as well
[37:13] come in
[37:21] sit
[37:29] Madam, I apologize on behalf of them both
[37:36] They said something wrong that they shouldn't have. I just ..
[37:46] Mr. Faraz, I like giving importance to work during work time.
[37:50]  If you'd talk about work only then I'd tolerate it
[37:56] also, talking about something else means that you are wasting mine and your time
[38:02] and I don't like wasting time
[38:08] Also, this is my personal matter. 
[38:11] Give me the file. I'll check it
[38:17] Thank you! You can go and work
[38:24] Right!
