[01:01] Congratulations. We at least have this one good news amongst all the stress.
[01:09] What good news?
[01:10] Mahnoor has got a car from her office.
[01:14] Wow. Congratulations dear.
[01:18] Mahnoor's colleague, Faraz, the one that gave you a lift,
[01:23] he's a very nice boy. He just got the car from the showroom and came to drop it home.
[01:31] We don't find such nice people anywhere.
[01:35] You were saying something was bothering you.
[01:41] sister Areeba is worried too and even mom.
[01:44] Yes, we are worried.
[01:48] What happened brother Saqlain?
[01:50] Mahnoor do you remember I wanted to discuss something with you since long.
[01:54] I did come to talk to you but circumstances didn't allow.
[02:00] Secondly, I was trying to handle it myself.
[02:06] What is it that cannot be solved without discussing with me?
[02:10] Actually its about the shop you own.
[02:16] Do you remember the tenant wasn't paying the rent and,
[02:21] I filed a case against him to get it.
[02:26] The decision was announced around two and a half months back.
[02:30] And what was it?
[02:33] That we have to sell the shop because he has been there for ten years and has an established business
[02:40] or that we can take a fixed amount of rent only.
[02:45] I was thinking rather than spoiling matters further, we should sell the shop.
[02:51] Mom that thug is very dangerous.
[02:54] He has been harassing him and threatening him. I've asked him to sell him for less money.
[03:03] God forbid, if he does something to him then what?
[03:08] God forbid dear.
[03:10] I wanted to appeal against him aunt
[03:13] but Areeba said it would only waste time and money.
[03:20] That's why I was forced to strike a deal for that shop for 5 million.
[03:25] Only 5 million?
[03:28] Yes because he is only giving 5 million.
[03:31] Although the market value of that shop is worth 20 million at least. But...
[03:35] But still, instead of two million you sold it for 5 million.
[03:40] I have to agree you're a great businessman for finding such a solution.
[03:47] Congratulations mom. Brother Saqlain took our problem to his own head
[03:51] and sold our shop worth 20 million for 5 million only.
[03:56] Now you and I don't have to worry about anything because he solves all our problem.
[04:01] Had brother Saqlain not been there, what would become of us?
[04:05] If brother Saqlain is with us, we'll be on the road soon.
[04:13] Wait. Why are you blaming my husband?
[04:18] If you can do something, do it.
[04:20] In fact leave your job and go run to the courts and lawyers.
[04:26] In fact go and deal with that thug so that you know why did he took up such a big loss.
[04:33] Areeba what is wrong with you? Mahnoor cannot handle all this.
[04:37] Courts and proceedings aren't for a woman.
[04:42] Then she should shut up.
[04:46] My husband isn't a sacrificial goat.
[04:49] He shouldn't be killed for your problem.
[04:51] There wasn't any big problem. Brother Saqlain escalated the matters himself.
[04:55] We could have solved the issue with a discussion. He had never bothered us anyway.
[05:00] This is brother Saqlain that took matters as a blow to his ego and then went to court.
[05:05] He could discuss with mom and solve everything.
[05:09] Its still not late.
[05:11] If aunt wants to talk to him, she should go.
[05:15] He might listen to her. Or maybe you could go.
[05:19] If you can save the shop, you should.
[05:21] How can Mahi argue with a thug?
[05:31] And he has been threatening Saqlain constantly and this is Mahi..
[05:36] You're underestimating Mahnoor, aunt.
[05:40] Mahnoor knows how to handle men. I've seen her in the office how she handles fifty men under her.
[05:47] In fact they can do personal tasks for her as well.
[05:53] Alright Mahnoor, I'll cancel the deal. Go and talk to him.
[06:01] brother Saqlain for God's sake don't leave anything to Mahnoor.
[06:05] She cannot handle anything and it will bring us more problem.
[06:08] Saqlain do as you have decided.
[06:14] If this loss is in our fate, we would bear it anyhow.
[06:21] Just rid us and yourself of him.
[06:26] And since this is Mahi's inheritance, transfer the money to Mahi's account.
[06:35] Alright, as you say.
[06:37] The money is Mahnoor's. I'll transfer in her account, as soon as I get them.
[07:01] Did you see Mahnoor's car?
[07:04] Yes I did. I caught a glimpse.
[07:08] Do you know who dropped the car?
[07:10] The boy Faraz who is her colleague and who used to give her lift till the bus stop.
[07:17] Either Mahnoor is very informal with him or she is very close friends with him.
[07:24] How could an assistant manager behave like a chauffeur?
[07:32] I am angry at her. She blames you so easily for everything.
[07:40] It is a big loss Areeba.
[07:44] It is a loss and we're upset as well. We didn't do anything deliberately.
[07:54] I know.
[07:59] Rather than escalating matters further, its best to sell the shop.
[08:03] I was forced to strike a deal for 5 million.
[08:09] Mom is saying come and eat.
I'm not hungry.
[08:13] Alright.
Wait. Come and sit here.
[08:27] Do you not believe me anymore?
[08:34] Why have you started to side with brother Saqlain now.
[08:38] You showed me down again today.
[08:43] This is a battle between you and brother Saqlain and I don't want to be a part of it.
[08:47] Initially I thought he was wrong and you were right but now anymore.
[08:57] This is your personal problem and I was the one who suffered always.
[09:03] Did you not feel the huge loss we incurred?
[09:06] I am sad but mom said you should be hurt the most because the shop is yours.
[09:14] What difference does it make?
[09:17] No matter whether it belongs to you or me,
[09:20] what worries me is that the rent paid for our finances and our needs.
[09:32] But...
So what if we don't get the rent from one shop. We'll not become beggars. We have more as well.
[09:38] Now go and tell mom yourself if you're not coming for dinner or else she'll keep sending me.
[09:49] You don't know Ramsha.
[09:52] Today he sold this shop for a loss and tomorrow he'll bring up another loss. If we don't stop him,
[10:01] he will definitely make us beg very soon.
[10:13] Here. This is the file that you need to show your mother in law.
[10:20] This shows the shop has been sold for 5 million.
[10:26] This is the draft in Mahnoor's name. The rest of the amount,
[10:37] Mushtaq has made the draft in your name.
[10:43] But tell me Mr. Saqlain, whats the rush?
[10:52] Tell me when will this money be transferred in my account?
[10:58] Haven't you become a little too greedy?
[11:00] Sir, you earned 10 million without even trying and that too because of me.
[11:13] This is my right, isn't it?
[11:19] Hmm. This is your share.
[11:28] The draft?
[11:34] Now tell me where should we invest this money in?
[11:38] Should we start a business or invest in property?
[11:42] Yes we should buy some property.
[11:45] Now your father in law purchased his shops for nothing and today they're worth millions.
[11:53] The place is so feasible, they'll be sold easily.
You're a sensible man.
[12:04] This is why you're still with me.
My pleasure sir and thank you for this.
[12:24] Hello? Yes this is Mahnoor and I talked about the case.
[12:33] Yes. No. This cannot be.
[12:36] The shop is sold now but I just want the case history and the basis of the ruling.
[12:44] Yes. I'll send you an email soon. Thank you. Yes Mr. Faraz?
[12:52] What is the progress?
[12:53] I wanted to tell you we've started the construction on our new project.
[12:59] Good. I want you to be in touch with the planning because its now our responsibility.
[13:05] Don't worry. I'm monitoring it properly.
[13:13] By the way did you start to learn driving?
[13:17] No. I'm managing with a driver for now. I don't get time to learn driving these days.
[13:25] You look worried since a few days. You were talking about a case.
[13:34] If you find it suitable you can share with me. I might be able to help you.
[13:42] Actually my father had some property but the court sold it and I don't know what basis it was sold on.
[13:51] My brother in law handles everything.
[13:55] But I wanted to handle everything myself because this way we'll lose everything gradually.
[14:03] I contacted the lawyer for that.
I have a solution for this.
[14:10] Usually property dealers have an idea about the amount the property nearby was sold for. We can contact a few.
[14:21] If you want, I'll come with you and talk to them. Or I can find out myself and tell you.
[14:31] Hmm..
[14:33] Whatever you think is fine. Do let me know.
[14:52] I have confirmed from four estate agents here
[14:55] and none of them said it was sold for a loss. Everybody said it went for a good price.
[15:02] Its value is worth over ten millions. You've been lied to.
[15:07] I thought so. Even if the court had auctioned it, it wouldn't have gone for so less.
[15:17] You understand everything then why did you ask someone to handle your property.
[15:23] You can still handle your decisions.
[15:28] Sometimes one has to be quiet even after knowing everything.
[15:31] Even if I raise this issue, I don't have any proof.
[15:37] Did brother Mushtaq tell you how much he sold the shop for? He's my father's old friend.
[15:47] He respected dad a lot. When he needed a job, dad gave him the shop to help him and now he's cheating on us.
[15:58] But oh well, I cannot do anything even when I know the truth. I'll have to be quiet.
[16:32] How did you like it?
[16:34] Its beautiful. Very nice.
[16:38] How can it be that I don't like what you get me?
[16:45] Do you know this is what I like about you. You trust my choice.
[16:53] Your choice is very nice.
[16:57] By the way, what is the happy occasion?
[17:03] Just like that. I liked it and bought it for you.
[17:08] If you want you can think of it as an anniversary present.
[17:15] Oh yes. I forgot. Our wedding anniversary. I was thinking the gift I bought for you..
[17:24] Who is calling? Hello?
[17:31] Yes?
[17:36] Okay. Who was with her? I mean what was the name?
[17:48] Faraz.
[17:51] Okay I'll look into it. Bye.
[17:59] Who was that?
[18:03] Mushtaq. The one we sold the shop to.
[18:09] So why is he calling now?
[18:15] Mahnoor went to him to find out how much did he purchase the shop for.
[18:21] The interesting thing is her colleague Faraz was with her.
[18:28] The entire day, the went to different estate agents to find out if I had taken money from this deal.
[18:39] But Mushtaq satisfied her.
[18:45] Mahnoor is so stupid.
[18:48] She goes out with strangers and is inquiring about you.
[18:56] If he had told her something wrong, would she have accepted it.
[19:01] This is what she wants.
[19:03] She wants a lead to blame me.
[19:08] The way she is roaming around with Faraz,
[19:14] I feel she takes him to be his family and not us.
[19:31] Oh well. Call your mother and tell her. She should know what is Mahnoor up to.
[19:39] You're right. I'll call mom and tell her right away.
[20:21] Yes, I'll ask her when she gets home. Don't be angry. I'll ask her.
[20:30] Bye.
Hello.
[20:34] What are you doing?
What did I do?
[20:38] You went to Mushtaq to find out how much did he sale the shop for?
[20:45] Yes. So this has reached brother Saqlain already.
[20:50] I didn't know that the two of them were so close.
[20:55] Don't you feel ashamed? What will he think that we're trying to go behind his back
[21:04] Mom, such disloyal people shouldn't really be judging us.
[21:08] Listen. I met two three estate agents and all of them said...
[21:13] Who is Faraz? You keep roaming around with him. Saqlain was telling me that..
[21:21] he dropped you here last night as well.
[21:23] I don't know why is brother Saqlain always lying to you about me.
[21:27] You make me the culprit and try to inquire from me.
[21:32] For God's sake mom, stop trusting brother Saqlain so much.
[21:36] He will eventually throw us in a big ditch.
[21:40] What benefit does he have in this? He wants the good for us.
[21:43] It is for his benefit. I know very well.
[21:47] I asked people around and everybody said that the shop was sold for good money
[21:53] but brother Saqlain said he didn't get a good amount.
[21:59] Oh well. Even after knowing everything we'll be quiet because its all for sister Areeba.
[22:08] brother Saqlain has caused us enough harm.
[22:12] We cannot do anything about him therefore its no use digging up old graves.
[22:18] But mom, please. Understand a bit at least.
[22:51] Move. Move. Give me space.
[23:00] How many marks did you get?
[23:02] Whatever I can see.
[23:04] Move. Let me see.
[23:20] Yes.
I think he has marked us incorrectly.
[23:24] How can this be? My exam went so good.
[23:30] Wow Mahir. Good job bro. Your scholarship is confirmed. Now treat us.
[23:38] Anytime bro.
[23:44] This Mahir bunks all classes and he'll get the scholarship.
He's very intelligent.
[23:51] You cannot compete with him. He's the favorite of all the teachers. Didn't you see?
[23:58] Everybody is surrounding him. They all ask him for help.
[24:02] I'd say we should ask him for help in the next semester as well.
[24:06] Hmm.. We'll have to do something of this sort.
[24:12] What would I tell home about my result? Sister Mahnoor is the problem. Mom won't even know.
[24:18] sister Mahnoor will come and question me.
[24:21] What are you thinking? Don't you want to go home? Come.
[24:30] All praise to the Lord. May God save my son from the evil eyes.
[24:36] I really believed you would make me proud one day.
Thank you.
[24:42] Faraz did you see? My child topped his class in this semester.
[24:49] Oh wow. Congratulations.
By the way, Faraz
[24:55] didn't you say I didn't study. Had I not studied would I get such marks? Not at all.
[25:02] Of course.
[25:04] You get marks when you work hard. Nobody just awards you marks.
[25:08] This is all because you worked hard my child.
[25:12] Work hard like this in the future so that you would get a good job.
Yes.
[25:17] Then you will share your brother's burden.
[25:27] Brother, have you arranged for the fee because I have to submit it by next week?
[25:33] Yes. I have money for your fee. I've arranged for your fee.
[25:39] Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[25:47] I will use that money to have fun.
[25:50] I'll hang out with my friends and go visit the northern areas during vacations.
[25:55] This semester is now free because of the scholarship but why do I need to tell them?
[26:04] I will not let the money I get to go. Mom' I'll leave now.
Okay.
[26:20] You have learned to drive well. I just saw. Who did you learn from? From Faraz?
[26:28] No. From the driver. I hired the driver for this reason.
[26:32] And another thing brother Saqlain, Faraz is my colleague. Don't take his name with me and make our relationship, suspicious.
[26:44] Only you can make it suspicious.
[26:46] You went with him to find a proof against me to prove me wrong.
[26:56] You're right. I didn't find any proof but I did catch your lie.
[27:03] But I'm amazed that you're still very adamant about what you're doing.
[27:08] You're still standing tall in front of me when you should be ashamed.
[27:27] This stiffness in your neck will be broken soon and then I'll be ashamed.
[27:35] I'll make you fall at my feet, you'll see.
[27:45] My grade point is so low. If my sister finds out, she'll destroy me.
[27:53] Yes.
Ramsha?
[27:55] I'll call you later.
[27:59] Yes?
You're result was expected today?
[28:03] Yes I have my result.
[28:06] But you didn't share your grades or your marks. Tell me.
[28:12] Actually.. I,
[28:20] my result didn't come good this time. I got 2 grade point.
[28:28] What does this mean?
[28:32] This is why I ask you to focus on your studies. But you spend time with your friends or this phone.
[28:40] I do study.
[28:43] Our university didn't give marks to anybody.
[28:46] The guy who stood first in class is every teacher's favorite, that's why he got good grades.
[28:53] What nonsense is this? Teachers don't have a favorite and if they do, its because they're good at studies.
[29:03] I don't understand what to tell you. Tell me. 
[29:06] You go to the university but nobody holds any personal grudges against you that they'll not give you good marks.
[29:12]  I've gone through this as well.
[29:15] You're right. I didn't study or focus on my studies. You should do one thing.
[29:23] You should slit my throat and then you'll be at peace.
[29:28] What is wrong Ramsha? Nobody slits throats if you get less marks. 
[29:31] I'm just trying to make you to understand to study.
[29:36] You had such good marks in the college because you focused on your studies.
[29:41]  If you focus now as well, you'll get good marks again.
[29:44] And if you don't understand anything, ask me for help. I'll guide you. I'm your elder sister.
[30:02] I asked your for a proposal for Aima but you didn't show me.
[30:07] I do have a proposal for Aima.
[30:10] Do you know they're good people and the boy has a good job as well but
[30:14] but what?
[30:15]  they the girl's brother to marry the boy's sister?
[30:18] Yes, like Faraz could marry their daughter and their son could marry Aima.
[30:28] Really? Tell me more about the girl and the picture.
The girl is very pretty.
[30:40] Girl?
[30:44] She looks rather aged.
No she's only 35.
[30:49] 35 years? My Faraz is only 30. There's no match.
[30:54] You look for matches when getting married for the first time.
[30:56] When getting married for the second time, you just have to compromise. 
[31:00] Step outside and see what people are saying about Faraz.
[31:05] Everybody is a witness that your daughter in law would shout and plead everyday.
[31:18] See, this girl is very nice and simple. Her first husband was very rude to her.
[31:26] Tell me. He threw her out with a small child.
[31:30] She is a divorcee and has a child as well.
[31:32] If you be so choosy, forget that you're getting a daughter in law.
[31:38] Don't judge your daughter in law through a telescope. 
[31:42] Be thankful that you'll find any.
[31:47] Tell me, don't you want a good son in law? Someone who earns well.
[31:53] Yes.
Then her brother is at a very good position.
[32:00] They have a car and house given by the government. 
[32:03] They just want the girl's brother to marry their daughter. That's it.
[32:11] Think about it. They're good people.
[32:31] Wow. Thank you.
[32:36] Get us tea as well.
Thank you.
[32:42] Wow. This is strong tea. By the way Mr. Faraz,
[32:46] I think you should get married now.
[32:50] Yes Mr. Faraz whats done is done. Forget and move on.
[32:56] Of course. How long will you wear shirts with broken button?
[33:01] Now we don't know whether Faraz's wife will know how to put in buttons because my wife doesn't.
[33:07] The truth is, she doesn't even know how to make round flatbreads.
[33:13] If she cannot make round flatbreads be thankful that she at least makes them. 
[33:17] That's what you should worry about.
This is right.
[33:22] We don't marry for this reason. Its for the companionship.
[33:28] Yes. My first experience was rather bad but,
[33:34] I'm scared of failing another time.
[33:40] But don't you worry.
[33:43] I've learned how to put in buttons myself.
[33:46] Its not that difficult.
Of course.
[33:51] Sir all my best wishes for you.
Thank you. For you as well. Go do your work now.
[33:57] Yes sir, we are working. Thank you.
[34:37] This is a cheque for 10 million, aunt.
[34:42] 10 million. Whose money is it?
[34:45] My savings and some I took out from the business.
[34:50] But why are you giving this to me, dear?
[34:56] The loss you incurred in the deal, I want to compensate for it.
[35:02] Mahnoor is asking everyone the price of the shop.
[35:13] What was the actual price of the shop?
[35:18] Oh well, no matter what the shop was sold for, Mahnoor should get her share.
[35:26] For God's sake, stop this.
[35:35] Mahnoor is bad mouthing me everywhere. How many people will I clarify things to?
[35:43] The deal didn't benefit me in any way.
[35:50] I didn't even keep even a single penny.
[35:53] I can't even think such a thing Saqlain dear.
[35:57] Its not possible aunt.
[36:00] It cannot be that you'll not listen to the accusations Mahnoor makes. 
[36:05] You'll hear them out at least once.
[36:10] You would have doubted me.
[36:14] I just want to drive your doubts away.
[36:18] No Saqlain I can never doubt you. You're like my own blood.
[36:24] You cannot deceive me dear. 
[36:26] As far is the money is concerned, are our relationships based on money?
[36:33] Money and property are the grass roots of arguments.
[36:40] If you start believing what Mahnoor says,
[36:47] I cannot see myself embarrassed in front of you.
[36:57] Please give this to Mahnoor.
[37:00] And after today..
[37:01] Don't say this Saqlain, if you're hurt by what Mahi said, I'll apologize on her behalf.
[37:11] Why are you making me a sinner?
[37:14]  I should apologize to you.
[37:18] Had that argument not risen,
[37:29] Let everything be. Keep this check please I'll not take it back.
[37:35] No I cannot keep this Saqlain. This is your hard earned money.
[37:43] Mahi, apologize to Saqlain and give him this check back.
[37:58] She has accused me without any proof.
[38:07] I had no other option.
I said something Mahi.
[38:12] Didn't you hear me? Why are you quiet? Apologize.
[38:17] But mom...
Do as I said. That's it.
[38:32] Keep this money, brother Saqlain.
[38:37] Its the same whether you incur a loss or we do.
[38:45] And whatever I've accused you for, for that,
[38:50] I'm sorry.
