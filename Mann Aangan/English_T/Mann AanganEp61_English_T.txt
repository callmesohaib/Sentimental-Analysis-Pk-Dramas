[02:09] umm .. sister Mahnoor .. sister Mahnoor came. Guard didn't let her come in
[02:15] I stopped the guard from not letting anyone enter the house without my permission
[02:20] but why?
[02:25] She is my sister. It is my right to meet her
[02:30] I am your husband. I have the most rights
[02:34] You can't even leave this room without my permission. You won't go anywhere until I give you permission nor will you meet anyone. Understood?
[02:45] Yes! Yes!
[03:50] Show me your phone
[03:54] Show me your phone!
[04:22] Who is Maheer?
[04:27] he?
[04:27] Who is he?
[04:29] He is my university fellow
[04:33] Receive the call
[04:34] and put him on speaker
[04:41] Hello? Hello Ramsha, are you fine?
[04:46] I .. I am fine
[04:48] Ramsha, do you even know that your husband is already married?
[05:03] You have been deceived. Its his second marriage
[05:12] Now I got it. It was a conspiracy to trap me and to humiliate you
[05:16] Brother Saqlain did the planning so that we would run away from house. You remember that letter. It wasn't me who wrote that letter. He humiliated you and put the whole blame on me
[05:35] Ramsha?
[05:37] Ramsha .. Ramsha there is no need to be worried. I am with you. I am standing with you in every difficult. Never think that you are alone ..
[05:50] She disconnected?
[05:54] She might be in some trouble
[06:09] So this is Maheer, your old lover. You ran away with him? And now planning it again secretly?
[06:20] Leave my hand
[06:22] You are already married? You were deceiving me?
[06:25] You were too
[06:27] I wasn't. You are a disgusting man. I don't want to live with you
[06:32] I'll kill you if you'll argue
[06:53] Sajida? Ismail?
[06:56] Where are you all? Come quickly
[06:59] Yes sir?
[07:03] Yes sir?
[07:03] Do not let anyone enter the house without my permission. If someone tries to enter, shoot him.
[07:11] Okay sir!
[07:14] Lock Ramsha's door. Do not let her come out in any case. Give her food inside and then lock the door again. Understood?
[07:24] Yes sir! This is what I'll do. Sir, are you going somewhere?
[07:30] I'm not going anywhere
[07:42] I'll see that who will come to rescue her. What if this secret was revealed by Saqlain?
[07:55] No! He himself was stopping me
[08:09] I will come .. What has happened to you? Its been only 10 minutes that I came here
[08:15] Yes, I will come home and talk. Shut the phone. 
[08:24] These kids don't let me go out of house
[08:27] Now that I am here, she is asking when will I come back? Now that I'm here, I'll leave after sometime
[08:38] By the way, you are here so suddenly today? I mean ..
[08:43] I thought to congratulate Yasir. He has got a job. I got some presents for him
[08:52] What was the need of this formality? Yasir's choice is very different. He always buys himself and always buy expensive things
[09:08] Now that you have got it, we have to keep it. By the way, I never give presents to anyone. I always give cash. They can buy anything they want
[09:23] I will be careful
[09:26] Yes! Do that
[09:32] Also, do not buy dowry for wedding
[09:42] Yasir was saying that ask auntie to give us cash. He also wants to buy car of his choice. I said I'll give your message to your mother in law. Now its between you and her
[09:58] Its between you and your son in law. I am not getting any benefit
[10:09] Have tea
[10:11] Yes!
[10:15] Take tea. What are you thinking?
[10:19] Nothing ..
[11:00] Mahnoor, shall we go? Its flight's time
[11:07] Shall I go too?
[11:11] No sister, you stay here. We'll be back in some time
[11:18] You just pray that things will be alright
[11:23] how?
[11:28] I ruined everything with my hands
[11:42] She will never forgive me .. 
[11:46] never
[11:49] I think we shouldn't talk about it right now.
[11:56] We'll leave now. We are coming
[12:26] I locked you in the room earlier. Now I will tie your hands and feet. Come with me. Come inside
[12:35] Sister?
[12:45] Ramsha ran away and spent night with a guy. Get her married today with respect otherwise she will suffer for her life
[12:58] Now you tell me? Who would marry this type of girl? Its a happy day today. How happy auntie would be
[13:22] Where are you going?
[13:23] Mother, Ramsha needs me right now. She is alone. I was talking to her and suddenly the phone disconnected
[13:29] She is married finally
[13:30] that wasn't a marriage. It was a deal that was made by brother Saqlain in exchange of Ramsha
[13:36] Whatever it is. And why has Faraad gone? What can he do and what was the need of interfering into this matter? Saqlain has already raised too many problems for us
[13:46] what are you saying mother? Sister needs brother right now. And Ramsha needs me. This is why I am going to her
[13:56] Stop Maheer
[14:03] why are you being emotional? Maheer, you have already taken too much pain because of Ramsha
[14:11] That pain was my punishment that I got for taking advantage of Ramsha's innocence
[14:18] But now I won't leave her alone. I will keep standing with her. She needs me
[14:26] Stop! Stop and give me the keys
[14:30] But mother
[14:30] Don't you dare take foot out of house. I will break your legs otherwise. Faraad and Mahnoor have gone already. They will handle it
[14:38] You go inside. You go to your room
[14:41] Go inside
[14:42] Mother listen
[14:42] Go inside
[14:43] I'm asking you to go inside. Go inside
[14:47] Move!
[14:50] There are no less problems that a new problem has raised
[15:46] Greetings madam
[15:48] Haven't you gone to village yet?
[15:49] Sir has out my duty here
[15:51] Fine move and open the door
[15:53] Let me inform sir
[15:54] There is no need
[15:56] Lets go
[16:26] Hello?
[16:27] Tell me how did Mahnoor find out that I'm already married?
[16:31] I don't know. I didn't say anything. Mahnoor misbehaved with me too much along with Areeba
[16:38] I don't know that
[16:41] Look Saqlain, I'm already telling you that if Mahnoor would come here again ..
[16:59] Naila?
[17:01] Come down
[17:53] Oh ..
[17:55] So this is the reason of your busy schedule due to which you aren't giving me and children any time
[18:02] Naila?
[18:02] Don't you dare ..
[18:04] Don't you dare say anything. I thought you are only corrupt in business but that's not it. You are more disgusting than that. I did have an idea about it but I had no idea that you'd re-marry
[18:24] This disgusting man lied to us. We had no idea that he's already married
[18:30] My brother in law got him married due to greed of money. He already wanted to take revenge from me
[18:41] She's telling a lie, Naila. They are fraud
[18:52] They have sent their characterless sister to me to get money
[18:57] just shut up
[18:58] We don't need your money
[19:03] I'm here to get my sister and I will take her from here
[19:13] Mahnoor, you go and bring Ramsha
[19:15] No one will go anywhere
[19:17] Don't you dare. Give her way
[19:23] Naila?
[19:24] You have no idea how much trouble have you got by cheating on me. I kept ignoring you till today. But I won't tolerate it at all
[19:38] Naila?
[19:38] Don't touch me
[20:37] Ramsha? Get up
[20:41] Where?
[20:42] To your home
[20:45] He won't let me go from here
[20:50] He can't stop you. I will take you
[20:53] Lets go. Get up
[21:21] Aren't you ashamed of getting married again?
[21:25] Did you go so blind in your greed that you forgot that you have your own daughter? Don't you dare show me your face again
[21:35] Don't you dare show us your face from today. I will go back and tell your kids about you. They should know how disgusting their father is
[21:50] Please, don't drag my kids in between
[21:52] Shut up!
[22:00] I will talk to you in court now
[22:02] What are you saying? I know that I made a mistake. I'm regretting. I have never given her your position
[22:11] and would never give it to her
[22:15] Do you want her not to be in my life, right? Fine .. I'll break my relation with her right here right now
[22:39] Fine, end this relation. Free her from your life right now 
[22:54] I divorce you
[23:08] I divorce you. I divorce you
[23:29] Did you see? For you, I have ended this relation. I have no relation with her now
[23:54] There is no cheap person like you in the world. Do you think that I will trust you that you left her for me?
[24:07] Tauqeer Ahmed, you left her for your property. The property that is in name of me and my children
[24:15] Naila, please do not say anything to kids. I won't be able to tolerate their hatred
[24:20] O shut up!
[24:24] I am ashamed of calling you my husband
[24:30] See you in court
[24:31] Naila ..?
[24:38] I will see you people
[24:44] I will not spare you
[25:18] What happened? Is everything okay?
[25:20] Nothing is okay. Mahnoor has ruined my whole plan
[25:24] What did she do?
[25:25] She took Tauqeer's wife to his home
[25:28] O! This is too wrong
[25:31] Wrong happened to me. I was about to be his partner but it would be canceled now. He will ask me his refund too
[25:37] Then don't return it. Be rigid.
[25:41] It is easy to say. He is Tauqeer. He is a man of principals.
[25:46] He couldn't do anything of Mahnoor and neither of his wife, and he will get you punished?
[25:52] That's different
[25:56] Those three sisters did a lot to you. They sent you out of that house when it was yours. But I don't understand that why don't you take an action?
[26:10] you should have kicked her out 
[26:13] Are you mad? Don't you know Areeba's condition? You want me to kick her out? 
[26:21] Why are you getting angry at me?
[26:25] Maria? Try to understand
[26:27] Enough! I don't want to talk to you. Understood?
[26:34] Maria? Listen to me? You get upset for no reason
[26:50] Lift your foot
[26:51] Mahnoor? Ramsha? This mark on her face?
[27:00] What happened? These marks on her face? Are you .. are you fine?
[27:11] Since when have you started caring about me?
[27:18] This is what you wanted?
[27:24] what are you saying?
[27:26] what?
[27:28] I'm saying it right
[27:33] You both wanted to see me in this condition
[27:48] You both ruined my life deliberately. You got me married to that man
[27:58] No Ramsha, it isn't like this
[28:01] My life is ruined because of you both and Saqlain ...
[28:08] Ramsha?
[28:09] Ramsha, open your eyes. Faraad call doctor quickly
[28:12] I will
[28:14] Ramsha?
[28:15] Sister, bring water
[28:17] Yes!
[28:18] Ramsha, open your eyes. Ramsha? Ramsha, what happened? Open your eyes. Sister, bring water quickly. Ramsha?
[28:28] Ramsha?
[28:30] Ramsha? Water ..
[28:33] Drink water
[28:35] Ramsha? Ramsha?
[28:39] Get up!
[28:41] Ramsha?
[29:03] Lie down
[29:42] Mother? Mother, come here quickly. Where are you?
[29:46] What happened?
[29:47] Listen to me? This bag has all the jewelry and cash. Keep it safe with you
[29:54] We don't have much time. Saqlain might return this money
[30:00] what if Saqlain comes and ask us about money?
[30:03] We will leave tomorrow before Saqlain comes. We will get money of this house tomorrow. Then we will leave this city. I just want to get rid of him now. Hold it
[30:16] Lets do one thing. I'll put the cash I have in it too. Do you have anything else to keep?
[30:22] I'll go and check everywhere. Now you prepare to go okay?
[30:25] Fine, I'll keep it somewhere
[30:50] I'm the culprit
[30:54] I took such a big decision of her life without thinking
[31:05] My brain wasn't working. I had only one thing in my mind. Get her married quickly 
[31:17] I don't know what happened to us all during that time
[31:22] None of us thought that this person would be a big fraud. I didn't think about it
[31:33] But Ramsha would never forgive me for her condition. She would never
[31:50] and I would never forgive myself. How did I let this happen to her?
[32:00] What has happened to you all? We all made a mistake but we weren't aware. Saqlain was the only one who knew the truth
[32:16] If he hadn't hidden it, then we would have never let it happen. The good part is that Ramsha is free from this trouble. Her relations is ended
[32:30] but the condition she is in ..
[32:37] She will be fine. It will take sometime, but she will forget. We all have to help her to forget it
[32:52] Its mother calling. I'll talk and come back
[32:54] You go back home
[32:57] No, I won't leave you alone. I'm coming
[33:53] mother?
[33:55] Ramsha?
[33:59] Ramsha? What happened?
[34:02] what happened Ramsha? Ramsha, forgive me. I won't be able to tolerate this burden
[34:09] Please be quiet
[34:11] why .. why did this all happen to me?
[34:17] consider it a nightmare and forget it. Everything will be fine
[35:06] This Mahnoor and Faraz has ruined my plan. I'll see them
[35:21] Your tea
[35:35] You should have atleast drank tea made by my hands for the last time
[35:40] God knows if its in your fate again or not
[35:52] Faraz?
[37:01] Greetings! How are you?
[37:08] Why? Why are you here?
[37:14] I came to apologize to you but .. 
[37:28] Do you think your mistake was worth an apology?
[37:33] I know that I don't deserve an apology but what do I do? I'm anxious. I feel as if I got cursed by you
[37:49] I never cursed you. And what are you regretting for now? You regretted because you got married to a loser like me?
[38:11] You have got everything. Everything that I couldn't give you
[38:17] What do you want now?
[38:23] But why am I still empty handed? I don't have anything besides having everything
[38:34] Please, forgive me. I will apologize to your mother and everyone else. Please forgive me. I know that I gave you lots of pain. I humiliated you everywhere but please forgive me
[39:00] I have already forgotten everything
[39:06] Say it once that you have forgiven me so that I can live my life in peace. Otherwise I ..
[39:16] I have forgiven you 
[39:22] Will you .. will you never hate me?
[39:32] I don't even want to keep a hate relation with you
