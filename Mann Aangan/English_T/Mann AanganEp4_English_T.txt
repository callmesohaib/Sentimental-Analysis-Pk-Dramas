[01:00] It seems that brother Saqlain has already given Wasay a character certificate. 
[01:05] Similarly, he must think of me as characterless as well.
[01:08] Why mother? Ask him why does he want to marry his cousin to me, a characterless girl?
[01:15] Silence yourself. What are you saying Areeba? Mahi said that he's a good man.
[01:22] Are you actually believing her? 
[01:25] That man is making a fool out of her and you can bet me on that.
[01:34] He will never bring a proposal for her.
[01:37] Mother, he will bring a proposal
[01:41] Mahi...
[02:05] Sister Mahnoor shall I ask you something?
[02:15] You shouldn't give up.
[02:18]  If brother Wasay hadn't proposed to you, then maybe I would have forced you for brother Hashir.
[02:26] The way brother Saqlain sent sister Areeba, I'm sure he's jealous of his status.
[02:33] He must have started thinking about the grand difference between him and that man, who is the son of a wealthy industrialist.
[02:38] Wasay's wealth is not only his good qualities.
[02:41] Money, power, and status, that doesn't matter to me.
[02:49] I didn't even think of that. Wasay's respect, care...
[02:56] him understanding me over minute things...
[03:03] are the things that won me over. Those are the reasons I accepted his proposal.
[03:07] I think that we can spend a good life together.
[03:13] Look, no matter what the reasons are, don't back off. About sister Areeba...
[03:20] she only has the intention of brainwashing mother. But don't back off, because I'm with you.
[03:40] Saqlain acted very maturely about this. 
[03:44] He didn't bring any complaint against you, nor did he question Mahnoor.
[03:49] Think about it, what if someone from our extended family had seen Mahnoor with that man, all of us would have been defamed.
[03:57] Mahnoor studied in co-ed, then what's the big deal?
[04:10] You always think that Mahnoor is right.
[04:15] You have every excuse in the book to protect her. 
[04:19] But what about me? Saqlain's aunt taunted me about being a barren woman.
[04:24] Areeba, quiet yourself. That is how cold the world is.
[04:30] Instead of tending to its wound, it scratches over it. To tell you the truth...
[04:38] I don't like Irham taunting you like this. Think for yourself...
[04:45] she uses every opportunity to use her words to hurt you.
[04:50] Then what kind of behavior will she have with Mahnoor?
[04:54] But Saqlain...
[04:55] Saqlain only wants the best for Mahnoor. He wants to her get married...
[05:05] into a good family. When he learns that the proposal came from Wasay's family, then his anger will cool down.
[05:12] But mother, Saqlain was telling me that man isn't good.
[05:18] I don't know how right, or wrong Saqlain is but...
[05:23] Mahnoor assured me that they are good people. All I'm asking you to do is be patient.
[05:29] If they bring Mahnoor's proposal, then they are good people. But if they do not...
[05:38] then we can not change what fate has written for Mahnoor.
[05:53] What do you mean? Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?
I did tell you Mahnoor.
[05:59] I was trying to convince mom and dad.
[06:02] Don't lose hope, I'll handle it.
How can I not worry?
[06:07] Your parent aren't agreeing to our marriage.
[06:11] To me their rejection means nothing.
But it does to me.
[06:17] Because if they don't agree to this marriage, then we can't get married.
Why not?
[06:23] You have to marry me, my parents have no concerns about it.
What will I tell my mother?
[06:30] Don't tell your mother anything, I will talk to her. We will marry in court.
[06:36] After the wedding, we'll go abroad. 
[06:39] We'll take a couple of years to complete our education.
[06:42] By then everything would get normal here. 
[06:45] I know my parents, by then they would have forgotten it.
[06:48] After that, they won't have any other option left other than to accept this relationship.
[06:57] Mahnoor.
[07:02] Wasay... we can't get married like this. I will never marry you in court.
[07:10] Neither I nor my family will agree to this.
What's wrong with this?
[07:16] Your thinking is wrong.
[07:18] When I was worried, you said that I was wrong to be worried.
[07:23] I knew your parents would not accept my status.
For me, it's still not a big deal.
[07:32] Mahnoor... you know I love you.
I love you a lot as well.
[07:38] I can't marry you in court by going against everyone else.
[07:45] I... cannot embarrass my family in front of everyone.
[07:53] This cannot happen.
[08:06] I've sent Areeba to her mother's home. I've asked her not to return home until her mother agrees to this proposal.
[08:14] Saqlain, you are wasting your time. I told you that I don't want to marry my son to Mahnoor.
[08:21] I'm telling you that they will apologize to you, don't you believe me?
[08:25] You know Hashir very well, don't you?
[08:28] He makes mountains out of molehills. 
[08:31] Do you think he'll agree to marry Mahnoor after she rejected him?
[08:36] No... believe me, I don't have the strength to talk to him.
[08:41] Ever since he came back, he's become completely silent. He's not talking at all.
[08:47] I fear that he might return this way.
[08:52] That's why I ask you to end this here. It will not achieve anything.
[08:58] Alright, if that's the case, I'll talk to Hashir myself.
[09:15] You have to marry me... you have to spend your life with me, 
[09:19] my parents have no concern about it. We'll marry in court.
[09:28] Mother is asking for you.
Go ahead, I'll be there.
[09:40] Saqlain was talking to me about this.
I'll ask her when she comes.
[09:46] I called her.
[09:50] What can I do? I'm worried, I don't know what to do.
[10:01] Mahi... my dear... did you talk to that boy?
[10:06] When is he sending his parents... 
[10:09] because we cannot move forward with this relationship without Saqlain's advice.
[10:25] Mahi... what happened? Why aren't you answering me?
[10:36] They will not come.
[10:40] What?
[10:47] Wasay's parents have refused to come.
[10:52] They said that there is a major difference between their and our status.
[10:59] Do you see? I told you... that man was just passing the time with him.
[11:07] It's not like that. He wanted to marry me.
Oh really?
[11:12] Even after his parents refused...
[11:16] That means that he wants to marry you in court.
[11:19] Don't make rash decisions Mahi. Your sister has to get married as well.
[11:25] Both of us won't be able to show our faces to anyone.
[11:30] Please... I'm not that selfish, nor am I that weak.
[11:37] I will not make my happiness on your grief. I have rejected his offer.
[11:43] I will only marry him when he involves his family.
[12:03] Thank God things ended before they started. There was no match between us and them
[12:10] They have a large family. Now Mahnoor can marry Hashir, right?
[12:16] There is no need for Mahnoor to refuse now. Should I talk to Saqlain now?
[12:49] Mahi... you're my brave daughter...
[12:55] Do you remember what your father said to you? He always asked me to think of you as a son.
[13:03] Because you have all the qualities for which people pray for a son.
[13:09] This is just a minor setback, this won't do anything to you.
[13:22] Mother...
[13:25] No matter how strong someone is...
[13:29] when a heart breaks, it's no ordinary thing that someone can forget.
[13:35] Time heals all wounds.
Some wounds never heal.
[13:43] But... don't worry... I'm completely fine.
[13:50] I'm sorry I worried you. Because of me, you were so worried.
[13:56] I shouldn't have told this you until Wasay's parents were involved.
[14:03] It's alright, I had already learned everything. 
[14:07] It would have hurt me if I had learned it from someone else.
[14:11] I was thinking of listening to Areeba and...
[14:19] Please... I don't want to hear all of this right now.
[14:25] I'm not a girl who lives in a dream.
[14:27]  I'm not waiting for a prince to come and solve all my problems.
[14:34] I want to do something in this world. I want to leave my mark on this world.
[14:39] My dear, I'm not stopping you from doing that.
[14:44] But Mahi, I have to marry you.
I will get married but...
[14:50] right now I don't want to talk about this. I need some time.
[14:58] I don't want to marry anyone.
[15:00] (inaudible)
[15:11] I'm here for you.
[15:15] You're waiting for him for no reason, he will not agree to this.
[15:19] Let me talk to him.
[15:29] Greetings.
[15:31] Greetings to you too.
[15:34] Where have you been? I've been waiting for you. I was just about to leave.
[15:40] I was with friends, is everything alright?
[15:45] Auntie was telling me that you've been quite upset.
[15:48] As you should.
[15:51] If a girl rejects a man like you, it's understandable that one gets angry.
[15:56] It hurts the ego.
[15:59] I'm trying to change Mahnoor's no, into a yes, but...
[16:05] auntie is telling me that you will not agree to this marriage now, why?
[16:15] Change her no into a yes brother Saqlain.
[16:22] It's my stubborn desire now... if I'll marry someone then that will be Mahnoor.
[16:27] Otherwise, I will not marry anyone. Have a good day.
[16:37] I think that you and I both heard Hashir's answer.
[16:43] I'm getting late, I should get going.
[17:05] Wasay...
What is it?
[17:11] Your ring.
[17:32] That means that mom was right, you have no importance for me or my love.
[17:41] For you my family... and my status...
[17:44] were everything. Because if I was important to you...
[17:49] then you would have listened to me.
You can think whatever you want...
[17:55] There is no restricting you from your thoughts. If you think that your family and status are more important to me...
[18:04] then fine... it must be that way.
[18:11] Mahnoor, you cannot break this relationship so easily.
[18:22] There is nothing left in our relationship.
[18:26] I've explained that to myself very well.
[18:31] You will too.
[18:34] From now on we go our separate ways.
[19:56] There is nothing left in our relationship. From now on we go our separate ways.
[20:32] I don't understand your decision.
[20:37] What's not to understand? You were the one who diverted my attention to Mahnoor.
[20:45] I didn't want to go there, remember?
After her refusal...
[20:50] I taunted Areeba a million times. Lord knows what I said about her mother and sisters,
[20:57] And I'm sure that she must have told her family about it.
[21:01] That doesn't make a difference. People tend to say a lot of things out of anger.
[21:07] Think about your decision one more time.
[21:10] I always think long and hard before taking my decision.
[21:13] When I make that decision, I stand by it. It's your responsibility to get me married to Mahnoor.
[21:48] Sister Salma...
[21:53] Sister Salma...
Yes, miss Areeba?
[21:55] I asked you to fry some kebabs with the tea but...
[22:00] you just served him tea.
Yes, everything is ready. I'll bring it right away.
[22:07] It's alright Areeba, no need to go through the trouble.
[22:11] What's the trouble with it?
[22:16] Greetings*
Sit down.
[22:25] Greetings.
[22:37] Auntie, I came here to be straight with you.
[22:43] Tell me, what decision have you made?
[22:50] My dear... Mahi doesn't want to marry right now.
[23:04] Has she gone insane? She's gone blind in love.
[23:11] That man has backed off because of his family. 
[23:14] Will Mahi spend her entire life grieving over him?
[23:24] That means that Mahnoor doesn't care about her family at all.
[23:28] This is your responsibility to turn her no into a yes.
[23:33] You're her mother.
[23:35] You can force her to marry.
[23:38] Forced relationships aren't strong. Nor do they lead to happiness.
[23:44] I've already given my word to my auntie and Hashir. It's a matter of my respect as well.
[23:50] Your explanations and Mahnoor's explanations won't make me back off.
[23:53] Mahnoor does what she wants. I can't force her.
[23:59] Try to understand.
[24:14] Alright, if that's your last decision, then listen to my decision as well.
[24:22] I can tolerate my insult, but my aunt is the eldest in my family.
[24:28] She's my elder and she brought a proposal here for Mahnoor on my say-so.
[24:32] If Mahnoor and Hashir can't get married, then you can keep Areeba with you as well.
[24:40] Saqlain...
[24:47] Saqlain, what are you saying?
What you just heard.
[24:52] You have a week. You can decide before Hashir arrives.
[24:58] Either Mahnoor will depart from this house and leave with Hashir, or your married daughter will come back here.
[25:07] Brother Saqlain...
Saqlain listen to me...
[25:12] You just said this to scare mother, right?
[25:18] So that she can convince Mahnoor.
[25:20] Mahnoor and auntie have forced me to take this decision.
[25:24] He's just saying that, why are you worrying?
[25:28] But... what's my fault in this?
Mahnoor is your sister.
[25:34] Because of her, I was insulted in front of my aunt and Hashir.
[25:38] And Hashir has said that he won't marry anyone else than Mahnoor.
[25:43] Yes but, Mahnoor does as she wants. You know how she is.
[25:50] I stayed with her for four days... mother and I tried to convince her but she didn't change her mind.
[25:59] Areeba, this is a war between respect and ego. I value my respect greatly.
[26:06] Mahnoor will have to change her decision, there is no other option...
[27:19] Congratulations.
[27:22] Mahnoor's wish will come true now. Saqlain will surely leave me now.
[27:29] What nonsense are you saying? God forbid!
[27:36] Do you think that...
[27:41] my brain allows me to think of anything good.
That's what I want to make you aware of...
[27:48] You say that brother Saqlain is a good husband and he indeed does act that way.
[27:56] He constantly announces that he takes good care of you and provides you with all of your needs.
[28:01] He does take care of me... but you can't digest that.
That's what I want to make you aware of...
[28:09] Is this the importance you have in brother Saqlain's life that he decided to leave you over such a trivial matter?
[28:17] Is that how much he cares for you?
It's not about ego, it's about respect.
[28:22] And you guys don't care about that. He has always respected you like a mother...
[28:30] He has always treated you like younger sisters...
[28:36] Do you know why he wants to marry you to Hashir...
[28:41] because Hashir is a good man from his family. He has no responsibilities...
[28:47] He's an only child and like me, you won't have to worry about in-laws.
[28:54] He has always thought the best for you.
[29:00] Mahi, in this regard Areeb is right. Saqlain isn't like that.
[29:06] He must have been very hurt. One only gets angry at those one loves.
[29:18] My dear... your single approval...
[29:23] can end all our pain and hardships.
[29:50] You have to marry me and spend your life with me. My parents are of no concern
[29:56] Let's marry in court.
[30:00] Hashir has no responsibilities, like me, you won't have to worry about in-laws. He's an only child.
[30:08] Your single approval will end all our pain and hardships.
[30:13] If brother Wasay hadn't proposed, I would have forced you to accept brother Hashir's proposal
[30:29] What? You've announced that you'll leave Areeba?
[30:33] What else should I have done?
[30:35] Hashir presented his conditions as well. I didn't like how you two were insulted there.
[30:42] You were wrong.
[30:47] You were hasty. I thought you were composed and calculated...
[30:54] I thought of you as a rational man, but no...
What are you trying to say?
[31:00] Will you leave sister Areeba because of me?
[31:04] Did you put a condition in your marriage agreement that her younger sister will marry me?
[31:09] No, right? Listen to me...
[31:15] I only asked you and mother to make Mahnoor accept my proposal. I didn't ask you to end relationships.
[31:21] Then tell us how we should force him. If he hadn't threatened them...
[31:26] they wouldn't have budged.
I don't know, but this is not right.
[31:33] Really... then what is the right way? It's your stubborn desire to marry Mahnoor, right?
[31:39] Then tell me the right way I can convince Mahnoor to marry you.
[31:44] Leave it be, there is no need to plead with a girl with so much ego.
[31:51] Girls like her never get married.
[31:58] Come with me...
[32:01] Where?
To your in-laws. To bring back sister Areeba.
[32:10] What are you thinking about?
[32:50] All of this happened because of me. I didn't know that it would escalate to this.
[32:56] Both of us came here to bring you back sister, so please come back with us.
[33:13] What are you looking at? Grab your stuff, don't you want to go?
[33:19] Go Areeba...
[33:24] Bless you, my dear.
Forgive me, auntie, I don't know what I said out of anger.
[33:29] You know I cherish every relationship I have.
[33:34] Whether that be you or my auntie. I can't tolerate any insults.
[33:40] I want to apologize to you for what happened that day.
[33:46] Hashir is a good man, you were right to praise him.
[33:52] The way you proved your maturity...
If only Mahnoor had done that, then we wouldn't be in this position...
[34:06] My dear... respect is what makes relationships.
[34:09] It's not a good thing to spoil old relationships for new ones.
[34:17] You are completely right.
[34:21] I think we're getting late. What do you think we should do?
[34:25] At least finish your tea.
No mother must be waiting for me.
[34:32] Farewell*
[34:44] Bless you, my dear.
Take care.
[34:51] He handled everything so well.
[34:57] How come brother Saqlain became so nice?
Go and close the door.
[35:03] I'll do it.
[35:10] I'm surprised... I didn't expect such a stubborn man like you to bend the way you did.
[35:19] When it's about love and respect, then there's nothing wrong with being flexible.
[35:29] Who knows, one might enter one's heart this way.
[35:36] Get in the car.
[36:21] Between us...
[36:25] brother Hashir is much better than brother Saqlain...
[36:30] Who doesn't have flaws? Don't we? He likes you a lot. In fact, he looks at you so emotionally
[36:40] Ramsha...
I think you should say yes. Why are you thinking so much about it?
[36:46] And... mother's problem will be solved as well.
[36:52] Concentrate on your studies.
[37:09] It's mother.
[37:15] Greetings.
[37:18] I'm fine.
[37:22] What?
[37:25] Really
[37:30] Sure, I'll tell him. Farewell. You take care as well.
[37:40] Mother told me that Mahnoor has agreed to the proposal.
[37:45] Thank God... someone's kind behavior finally melted that girl's heart.
[37:52] I'm very happy.
