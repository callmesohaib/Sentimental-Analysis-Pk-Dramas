[01:37] Hello Mr. Touqeer.
Hello Saqlain. How are you?
[01:42] I'm fine. How are you?
Everything is fine. Sit down.
[01:45] Thank you.
[01:47] How was your flight? I hope everything was good.
Everything was good.
[01:53] Yes I think this time you're here for a long time. I had an idea after our last conversation on the phone.
[02:03] Do you know I always have something or the other going on in my life?
[02:09] But right now I'm on vacation. There are a few things I'm thinking about but I need to be sure of them before going ahead.
[02:19] You know my habits.
Yes. I know all your habits very well.
[02:26] And you don't have to worry. Everything will be arranged for.
I know.
[02:35] Your friendship has always been beneficial for me. I trust you blindly.
[02:48] Did you have breakfast?
Not really. But tell me, how is everybody at home?
[02:54] I told you I'm on vacation.
I'm sorry.
[03:00] Now that you mention your family, I think you've never made me meet your family. Neither have you ever invited me at your house.
[03:09] Hmm. Its nothing like that. You can come whenever you like. Its like your own house.
[03:15] Alright then. You decide the day and time. I'll come.
As you say Touqeer.
[03:23] Now lets order. Excuse me? I had ordered our drinks.
[03:32] You know my taste very well.
Time teaches us a lot of things.
[03:39] Bring the menu please.
[03:46] I am looking at a factory location.
[03:52] If you can scrutinize it, we can discuss.
[04:02] Why not Touqeer? I have a few locations in mind. Let me line them up and then we'll go check them out.
[04:54] Faraz? Why are you behaving like this?
[04:59] If you want I will apologize to aunty.
[05:03] Its your wish.
You don't know the entire thing and this is why you don't understand the situation.
[05:10] Then you tell me everything. What is it that's bothering you and making you so insecure?
[05:19] A few days ago, I came home to pick a file for work.
[05:25] And Maheer had brought Ramsha home at that time. And do you know neither Aima, nor aunty was home.
[05:33] Had aunty or Aima seen Ramsha at home, what would they think about her?
[05:37] Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
[05:41] How could Maheer do such a  thing? I'll talk to him..
Wait. Its not only Maheer's fault. Ramsha is equally responsible.
[05:48] This is why its important to stop them. If Saqlain finds out, God knows what he will do.
[06:44] At least have breakfast before you leave.
I don't feel like it.
[06:49] Listen, don't worry.
[06:54] People say we definitely get whats written in our fate.
[06:59] You'll see, God will benefit your business so much that your loss will turn into a profit.
[07:08] As God wills.
[07:11] I pray to God that it happens.
[07:16] I wanted to ask you something.
[07:20] What is it tell me?
[07:22] Your friend was coming for dinner tonight, will he come?
He will come.
[07:29] Alright.
[07:43] Bye.
Bye.
[07:55] Saqlain is already worried otherwise I would have fixed you by telling him what you did.
[08:05] What is wrong, why have you started doubting me so much?
[08:11] I have really not done anything.
Just focus on your studies or else I'll be forced to take an immediate decision.
[08:20] I just want to get you married so that I can be rid of you and go back to my house.
[08:27] Please..
[08:56] He isn't answering. God knows what you said to Yasir.
[09:03] Mom, I didn't say anything. You can ask Mahnoor yourself.
[09:11] This means Mahnoor knows everything as well.
[09:16] Have some fear. You advertise it for everyone. Can't you keep some things to yourself?
[09:28] Here, take this phone and congratulate and wish Yasir on his birthday.
[09:50] Did he answer?
[09:56] See, he replied. See what is it?
[10:00] You were just upset without any reason that he wasn't answering your calls.
[10:05] He must have been busy thats why he didn't answer.
[10:34] Ramsha, the screen is broken. Its alright, I'll get it repaired.
[10:43] How much will it cost?
[10:46] What do you need to know for? I'll get it done.
[10:52] Hmm. Actually Saqlain hasn't handed me my pocket money yet and I'm out of cash.
[11:01] Ramsha come on, it won't cost hundred thousands. And of course since it broke because of me, I'll change it.
[11:08] In fact do one thing. Manage until tomorrow. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.
Okay. I will.
[11:16] Thank you.
Its okay. As it is, I can do anything for you.
[11:25] Ramsha tell me, what can you do for me?
[11:31] Anything.
Anything? What do you mean?
[11:36] I mean stupid I love you so much that I can give you my life if you ask for it. You just have to ask.
[11:46] The thing that is mine, why should I ask you for it?
[11:53] But tell me one thing, how much do you trust me?
[12:01] More than myself.
Will you be with me no matter what the situation is?
[12:09] Always.
Sure?
[12:12] Hmm.
Promise?
[12:22] Promise.
[12:27] Good.
[13:06] How are you feeling now?
[13:10] I'm fine. I'm still alive.
[13:17] I was very stressed yesterday.
[13:21] I said so much to you because I was worried.
[13:26] I didn't even think that the loss that we met, wasn't only mine.
[13:36] It was ours.
[13:40] Thank God. At least you realize my pain.
[13:47] Do you have any address for Rameez?
[13:55] Rameez's address?
[14:00] Yes I do but he must have left by now.
[14:09] You must have forgotten. I told you he lived with his friend as a paying guest.
[14:17] Alright. 
What alright?
[14:22] I'll find him. I'll get all my money back from him.
[14:32] He must have left the city.
If he's in the country, he cannot hide from Saqlain.
[14:44] Oh well.
[14:48] Now you should take good care of yourself.
[14:58] I'm sorry once again.
[15:02] Its okay.
[15:28] Aima, why are you sitting here?
[15:32] Just like that.
Are you crying?
[15:37] No.
[15:42] Look at me.
[15:46] What happened? Did aunty say something to you?
[15:52] Did Yasir say something?
[16:01] I told you to ask aunty to talk to him.
[16:06] He didn't even answer her calls.
[16:13] Maybe you should have let aunty gone on his birthday.
[16:23] Perhaps Yasir didn't like that. He is your fiance.
[16:30] Its nothing wrong if you met him.
Look at the messages he sent me.
[16:47] This is very wrong. Who talks like this?
You don't know.
[16:56] He humiliates me and taunts me.
[17:04] I'm stupid and insensible which is why my mom is rushing to get me married.
[17:14] Had I had any capabilities, she would have allowed me to study more. Girls who are smart and intelligent, their parents allow them for higher education.
[17:34] Yasir knows how much I asked mom to agree.
So much is happening. Why don't you tell aunty about it?
[17:45] I tried talking to mom. Everytime she says that he must be joking. In fact she encourages me to talk to him.
[17:56] So that I can control him once we get married. Tell me yourself, how can someone control a person like him?
[18:06] And to be honest I don't want to control him. You don't have an idea how much humiliation I feel. How much disrespected I feel.
[18:16] You're right. I can understand. No matter what the relationship is. Its very important to give respect to one another.
[18:28] Nobody can disrespect you, especially the person you're thinking to spend your life with.
[18:41] Don't worry. I'll talk to Faraz. Come on. Good.
[18:57] Who came at this hour?
[19:05] You? Why are you here?
What do you mean why am I here?
[19:10] Didn't Fariya ask you not to come here?
I want to talk to Fariya. Where is she?
[19:16] Saqlain is with her and Saqlain knows about yours and Fariya's affair.
[19:23] How did he find out?
Let that be. But Saqlain is no less than a brute right now.
[19:30] Whatever my child is going through, she's bearing it. But if he sees you here, he'll not spare anyone.
[19:38] I cannot leave Fariya on Saqlain's mercy.
She will handle him. She can calm him down.
[19:44] But you leave from here or else Saqlain will shoot us all. Go away.
[19:51] I'll come later.
Listen, call before you come. Do you understand? Now go.
[20:03] Why are you standing in my way? Move.
[20:09] Move. Why are you blocking my way?
No. Nothing.
[20:55] How many times have I stopped you? How many times have I told you this is for your own good?
[21:02] I will not hear another word. Do you think all of us are insensible and you're the one whom God has given all the sense?
[21:09] Had you a little sense, you would have understand that you don't deserve Maheer.
I'm warning you..
[21:17] I will not hear another word against Maheer. 
And I will not tolerate you saying anything against him.
[21:22] Faraz told you everything?
 Faraz didn't tell me anything. In fact Faraz argued with Maheer because of you and I heard them.
[21:31] Its because of there are fights in my house.
Because of me?
[21:34] Yes because of you. I'm tired of trying to make you understand but you..
[21:38] What happened? You two are fighting?
 I don't know. Ask her.
[21:44] Whenever she comes she fights with me. I don't know what problem she has with me.
Ramsha? Mahnoor?
[21:53] Nothing.
I heard, the two of you were fighting.
[21:56] Actually I was trying to make her understand but she thought I was arguing. She's young.
[22:02] What is it? What was the argument about?
[22:07] Nothing at all.
Then why did you attack Ramsha? What happened?
[22:20] See Mahnoor whatever the problem is, tell us on time because once time passes by, all that is left is regret.
[22:27] There will be no regret. Don't worry. Its between Ramsha and I. I'll handle it.
[22:36] I'll leave now. Bye.
Bye.
[22:43] I could hear them fighting outside and she said they weren't arguing.
Yes I was also in the kitchen. I didn't hear anything.
[22:52] I asked but she didn't tell so I don't know..
[23:16] Do you want to talk to me?
Yes I want to talk about Aima.
[23:23] Aima? What happened to Aima?
Aima is worried because of Yasir.
[23:33] She cannot understand Yasir.
[23:38] Does Aiman not like Yasir?
Nobody can like a person who doesn't respect her and doubts her about everything.
[23:49] Someone who has a lot of mood swings.
Is this how Yasir behaves with Aima?
[23:56] I thought both of them needed to give time to each other. I told Aima to give Yasir some time and that he'd understand.
[24:08] But Yasir isn't ready to understand Aima.
[24:16] Now I feel Yasir doesn't want to understand her. Please talk to aunty.
[24:24] Two people cannot spend life together if they don't want a relationship or if they don't want to compromise.
[24:33] Its about Aima's whole life.
[24:47] Ramsha? Where is Areeba?
[24:50] Yes, I'm here. I was waiting for you.
[24:56] Is your friend coming today?
Yes he'll be here in a while.
[25:01] I've made some good arrangements for dinner.
Alright.
[25:08] I was thinking I'd go home.
What do you need to do there?
[25:12] Actually I need a few things. Everything is there. I thought I'd go and get it.
[25:21] Tell me, are you giving the house on rent. Should I...
Why are you so worried about the house all of a sudden?
[25:30] I will give it on rent when I have time. I'm stuck right now. You do know I suffered a loss of five million.
[25:38] People get a heart attack after suffering such a big loss.
God forbid. What are you saying?
[25:46] Leave everything. I'll see if I need to give it on rent or if I need to sell it, when I have time.
[25:53] Why do we need to sell it? Where will we live?
Why?
[25:58] Where we're living, isn't this a house? You do know I suffered a loss of five million. I need money to invest in my business.
[26:07] I need sources. Earlier I sold your shops to invest the money and now again..
[26:18] God will handle everything. He'll find a way. I'm going to change.
[26:33] Did Saqlain sell your shops?
Yes.
[26:42] He needed the money.
[27:28] I want you to call Yasir at home. I want to talk to him.
What will you talk to him about?
[27:33] About his attitude with Aima. Aima doesn't like it.
Who told you that?
[27:41] Aima doesn't like that?
[27:47] Mom, I live in the same house. If you don't tell me, will I not find out what the problem is?
[27:56] It was Yasir's birthday today.
Yes.
[28:00] And he invited Aima?
Yes but I stopped her right there because I know you wouldn't like Aima meeting Yasir alone.
[28:14] No. I will never allow for this.
[28:20] Mom knows, brother. Ask her how Yasir humiliates me.
[28:28] She has lost her mind. She doesn't know the difference between jokes and insult. He said a few things and she minded them.
[28:41] He doesn't have a right to jokingly insult Aima. If he does this before the wedding, what will he do after?
[28:48] Nothing will happen after the wedding, everything will be fine. This period between engagement and wedding causes arguments. Everything will be alright.
[29:00] I made a mistake. I shouldn't have allowed Aima to talk to Yasir on the phone. Your wife has encouraged her and spoiled everything.
[29:12] Mom, why are you blaming Mahnoor without any reason? Don't you see Aima's face and realize how unhappy she is.
[29:22] I just want you to call Yasir and his mother home.
What would that do?
[29:30] You will spoil everything.
Your haste spoiled everything. I did stop you but you didn't.
[29:38] Oh well. Do what I'm saying. Call them home so that we should talk to him and make him realize his attitude.
[30:01] Come. Please. Come. This is my humble abode.
[30:12] I hope I wasn't late.
Oh no. You're not late. You're right on time.
[30:18] There was a lot of traffic and I stopped by to get some gifts for your family.
You didn't have to do this brother, Touqeer.
[30:27] I came to your for the first time, I couldn't come empty handed.
Its like your own house. You can come whenever you please.
[30:34] Come inside. Why are you standing? Come.
[30:39] Your house is very pretty. I like it. 
Thank you so much. Please sit down. I'll call Areeba.
[30:48] Areeba. Here..
Hello.
[30:52] Hello.
Touqeer this is my wife, Areeba.
[30:55] How are you?
I'm fine. What about you?
[30:57] Thank God. These are a few gifts for you. Please keep them.
[31:09] Thank you so much. But you didn't have to be so formal.
Its nothing.
[31:18] Areeba, ask Salma, to get juice.
I can't get the AC in my room to work. I don't know..
[31:43] You have guests. I'll come later.
Wait. She is my younger sister, Ramsha. Ramsha..
[31:52] this is Mr. Touqeer. Saqlain's friend.
[32:00] Hello.
Hello.
[32:14] I'll get juice.
Sure.
[32:16] I'll also leave.
Where are you going? Sit down.
[32:20] Yes?
Please sit.
[32:22] Sit down.
Have a seat.
[32:34] So what do you do?
[32:40] I? 
What do you do?
[32:48] I'm doing my MBA.
[32:55] MBA? Very impressive. 
She's very intelligent.
[33:09] Praise be to the Lord.
[33:18] Mr. Touqeer you mentioned that you wanted to set up a factory here, what about it?
Yes..
[33:30] I'm thinking about it.
[34:08] Mahnoor. Wait.
[34:13] Why did you have to tell everything to Faraz?
Aima is worried.
[34:20] That's why.
I know how much you want good for Aima.
[34:29] God knows what you're filling in her brain.
I've never misguided Aima. I've always wanted the best for her.
[34:39] Alright, this is how you want the best of her? She has begun to dislike Yasir.
You know very well why she dislikes Yasir.
[34:50] Whatever relationship I have with Aima but she is your daughter. Do you want Aima to live in a relationship where she doesn't get love or respect?
[35:05] Where she gets insulted jokingly and she bears everything. I don't want Aima's engagement with Yasir to be called off.
[35:15] I just want all misunderstandings to be cleared. This is why I discussed everything with Faraz.
[35:24] Mahnoor, when things reach men, there is an argument and I don't want..
Aima is your daughter.
[35:34] But she is Faraz's sister as well. Faraz cares about Aima as much as you do and then,
[35:43] you'll be there. If you think something is wrong, you can stop or explain him there and then. You're the elder.
[35:56] I'll think about it.
[36:12] I've done recce for some locations for your factory. I'll show you and yes..
[36:20] I am thinking about a factory but there is something in my mind. Investment is not an issue but I'm thinking, alone,
[36:31] I cannot handle everything.
Why are you worried? I'm here. I'll help you wherever you need help.
[36:41] Yes. I can trust you blindly.
[36:52] Lets do one thing. When we meet next we'll discuss then.
Sure. As you like.
[37:03] I've served dinner.
[37:09] Mr. Touqeer we have dinner served. Please come.
[37:12] Why did you have to be so formal?
Its nothing formal. Its your own house. Will you not have dinner here? Come.
[37:21] Alright. Thank you.
Please. Come. Please sit.
[37:36] Please start.
Will the rest of the family not have dinner with us?
[37:46] The entire family is here. 
I'm talking about your wife's little sister. Will she not have dinner?
[38:03] Oh yes. She'll have dinner later.
[38:09] Yes. She'll have dinner later. Please start.
I think you're being formal because of me. If that's so, please don't.
[38:25] No. Its nothing. You're like a family member to us.
You call me your family member.
[38:36] And then a member of the family is missing from the dinner table. This isn't right Saqlain.
[38:46] You're right.
[38:51] Areeba, go and call Ramsha. Tell her to come and have dinner with us.
Sure. I'll call her.
[39:00] Please start at least.
Yes, thank you.
[39:09] He is such a weird man and he was looking at me with such creepy eyes and Saqlian didn't even say anything.
[39:19] Why isn't the AC working? Please start.
Ramsha, come and have dinner.
[39:27] I'm not hungry, please eat.
Saqlain is calling and Mr. Touqeer is asking about you.
[39:33] Why is Mr. Touqeer calling me? I mean what will I do there?
[39:43] He thinks we're being formal because of him. You're not hungry. Its okay. Just sit with us for a while.
[39:50] I'm not hungry, what will I do there?
Ramsha, Saqlain is calling.
[39:58] Should I tell him you're not coming. Come on its dinner time. Sit for five ten minutes and come back. You're always in your room.
[40:08] Come and have dinner with us sometime. Come on.
Alright. You go. I'm coming.
[40:19] You won't work...
