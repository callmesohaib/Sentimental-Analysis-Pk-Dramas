[01:19] why don't you get it? 
[01:21] I've moved on in my life, and your words doesn't mean anything at all
[01:28] you are not happy in your life, right?
[01:29] who said this to you that I'm not happ
[01:33] your eyes are telling me, Mahnoor 
[01:36] that you are suffering a lot
[01:41] that person is not capable enough for you whom you've chosen as your life partner
[01:56] your status is quite high 
[02:00] and your husband doesn't matches it a bit
[02:14] how dare you to talk like this about my husband!
[02:18] what do you know about Faraz? You know nothing about him!
[02:23] Mahnoor, I only know... 
[02:25] that even today I love you a lot
[02:29] are you in your senses, what are you talking about Wasay?
[02:32] you are a well-educated & an intelligent person
[02:36] such crazy words aren't looking good from your mouth
[02:39] Mahnoor
Wasay!
[02:41] look at my folded hands, please go away from here
[02:44] where shall I go?
[02:46] if I would have gone somewhere
[02:48] or would have lived peacefully then had I stopped you on your way?
[02:53] not me, in fact you are coming in my way again & again
[02:57] you are stopping me to move ahead
[02:59] I accept that I had loved you a lot in my life
[03:03] and I had wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
[03:08] but... when I needed you the most
[03:11] you couldn't support or stood by my side
[03:20] today when I've moved on in my life after fighting these difficulties
[03:25] Faraz gave me a new life, he gave me courage. He made me a new person
[03:31] and today! Today you want me to come back to you after leaving him
[03:37] how could you think of it?
[03:41] I only have respect in my heart for you, I only respect you!
[03:45] I respect you by thinking that I've spent a few good moments of my life with you
[03:52] I don't have love for you in my heart
[03:56] I've love & respect for Faraz in my heart, he is my husband
[04:00] not just my husband, he is my life partner as well
[04:04] I cannot see anyone else in his place
[04:10] if you think that you respect me a little
[04:14] then please forget me
[04:16] let me move on in my life
[04:20] the more you'll stop me in between the more I've to look back
[04:26] and I don't want to look back now
[04:28] I want to move forward in my life with Faraz
[04:36] I really don't have anything in my heart for you
[04:39] please forget me
[04:41] think about me for once
[04:44] if you'll keep coming into my life again & again
[04:48] then how will I face Faraz, how will I answer him?
[04:54] I don't want to be ashamed in front of Faraz
[04:58] I just want to ensure him that its only him in my heart
[05:02] there is nobody else except for him
[05:07] it is better for you to understand this as soon as possible
[05:13] that I don't have any place for you in my life, nor it will ever be
[05:18] what does he know about me?
[05:21] Faraz knows everything about you
[05:24] I have never hide anything from Faraz
[05:27] Mahnoor...
Wasay, please leave
[05:30] for God sake, don't ever come in between my way or try contacting me in the future
[05:39] I don't want to meet you, nor I want to talk to you or keep any contact with you
[05:47] just look at me & say it once
[05:50] that you don't love me
[05:55] are you happy without me?
[06:00] I am very happy without you!
[06:06] and I don't love you
[06:09] I only love Faraz
[06:13] and I am very happy with him
[06:17] Okay
[06:22] are you saying this from your heart?
[06:24] look into my eyes
[06:26] you will get to know
[08:02] sister Salma
[08:09] yes madam
[08:10] bring the bag from upstairs
[08:12] do clean it before bringing
[08:13] Okay, I'm bringing it
[10:09] don't take this
[10:10] I got this from there
[10:12] let's go!
[10:15] its the same necklace that Saqlain gave me & the robbers took it away
[10:25] but... 
[10:28] how come it got into the cupboard?
[10:35] how come it got here?
[10:38] and that too inside my cupboard
[10:47] madam, I've brought the bag after cleaning it
[10:53] yes... keep it there & keep the clothes inside it
[10:56] Okay
[11:15] it means somebody has informed
[11:18] the person who had spied seems to be very close
[11:21] some of your acquaintance
[11:55] where is Faraz?
[11:57] what do you mean that he isn't inside the office
[12:00] he has gone outside?
[12:02] when?
[12:07] ok fine
[12:12] where Faraz has gone!
[13:06] that person is not capable enough for you whom you've chosen as your life partner
[13:10] your status is quite high 
[13:13] and your husband doesn't matches it a bit
[14:42] Wasay doesn't have any importance in my life
[14:45] he is no more in my heart
[14:49] everyone claims that they love
[14:52] but its not easy to prove love
[14:55] but you've proved your love everyday
[15:00] I feel tangled whenever I think about it
[15:06] because I don't understand
[15:08] whether I have more respect or love for you in my heart 
[15:42] don't know where Faraz has gone
[15:48] I made such a big mistake
[15:51] by calling Wasay to my office as I was so worried at that time
[15:53] I should have introduced Faraz to him
[15:59] but how I would have talked to Wasay in front of Faraz?
[16:03] I hope Faraz isn't upset with me
[16:13] hey Mahnoor, is everything alright?
[16:18] yes, everything is fine
[16:20] Aunty, please talk to brother Yasir's mother. And tell her to send him to the office at 10 Am
[16:26] I've talked about him, God willing his interview will be done
[16:30] thank God, its a good thing
[16:33] Mahnoor, I had asked you to do something for Maheer as well
[16:38] now see, he has been sitting inside his room since morning. Also he hasn't eaten anything properly
[16:43] how will it work this way? This way my son will get sick
[16:48] don't you worry a lot, slowly & gradually everything will be fine
[16:52] in fact, I've to a few people in the education department
[16:57] hopefully, Maheer's admission will be done soon
[17:00] God willing! Let me prepare tea
[17:03] No, we'll drink tea together once Faraz comes
[17:08] Okay
fine
[17:35] where is the money?
[17:35] inside my purse
[17:37] not these, where are those 25 lacs?
[17:44] I haven't understood one thing as of yet
[17:46] how those people know that we've kept 25 lacs inside the cupboard?
[17:56] yes Saqlain, Areeba is absolutely correct
[18:00] only contractor knew that I had cash inside my house
[18:04] and he is the only person who was stalling to take the money from the past few weeks
[18:08] I think its his conspiracy
[18:22] what's the matter, what happen?
[18:25] Nothing!
[18:30] you had to go home, have you visited?
[18:32] had you brought whatever you wanted to, or there is still something left?
[18:35] No, yes... 
[18:37] I've brought the important stuff
[18:42] good!
[18:44] don't go there again & again
[18:47] tomorrow on wards few labors will work there, so it doesn't look good to go there again & again
[18:55] what's the matter, you are so quiet
[18:59] No, just like that. Its nothing
[19:04] did you had a discussion?
[19:07] with whom?
[19:09] who else it could be? Ramsha or Mahnoor?
[19:12] No, I didn't contacted anyone today
[19:17] I was so busy in the house, so the day had passed just like that
[19:22] Okay
[19:27] go change, meanwhile let me serve the dinner
[19:35] Okay
[19:48] yes yes, absolutely
[19:51] Okay, bye!
[19:56] thank God I got rid of this problem
[20:01] otherwise Yasir's mother was after me
[20:05] I pray that she doesn't make another wish
[20:10] Faraz is already so frustrated
[20:13] God shall bless Mahnoor for the way she has handled the matter
[20:19] sister-in-law is so nice, do you realize it now?
[20:22] or do you still have complaints against her?
[20:27] she is nice
[20:29] she is so nice, & there is no doubt in it
[20:32] mom, do you know that sister-in-law already knew about Maheer's scholarship
[20:36] but she hadn't told brother Faraz till date
[20:40] just to save your reputation
[20:47] mom, sister-in-law is our well wisher. She takes very good care of all of us
[20:51] See, she didn't let brother know about Maheer's scholarship so that he doesn't become suspicious about him
[20:57] Also she had saved you to become guilty in front of brother
[21:01] Still Faraz got suspicious about Maheer because of Mahnoor's sister
[21:06] even today is so mad at him
[21:09] So mom its Maheer's mistake
[21:11] when am I saying that its not his mistake?
[21:15] how would I know that he is in love with Ramsha. Otherwise, I would have seek her proposal
[21:21] I had made Mahnoor my daughter-in-law, so I would have brought her sister too
[21:27] why would I have an objection!
[21:31] at least Maheer should have talked to me properly
[21:34] I kept thinking that he is doing a time pass
[21:46] what shall I say now
[21:48] nothing can be done 
[23:05] why am I hiding this matter from Saqlain?
[23:09] I should tell him that the necklace... 
[23:12] what shall I do, I don't understand anything
[23:16] whatever it is, but the necklace didn't come over there with magic
[23:22] somebody had kept it inside my cupboard
[23:26] that too by hiding it inside my clothes
[23:30] but who?
[23:33] who it can be besides me & Saqlain who... 
[23:45] Saqlain!
[23:58] sister!
[24:01] yes Aima
[24:02] sister, brother Faraz is not attending the phone and... 
[24:06] mom is getting so worried as he hasn't come home as of yet. However, he had left the office before you
[24:15] sister, is there any problem?
[24:18] did you guys had a fight? If yes, then please tell us
[24:20] No, there isn't any such thing. You know.. 
[24:24] I & Faraz had never fought
[24:31] No, but I thought that maybe he is upset on something
[24:36] why would he be upset?
[24:38] he has clearly refused for Yasir's job
[24:41] he wasn't in the favor of helping him in any way
[24:47] Its not the matter. The reason behind Faraz's anger was something else
[24:52] but today, I had informed Faraz about Yasir's interview in the office
[24:56] tell aunty not to worry. Faraz must be on his way
[25:01] did you call to ask him, sister?
[25:04] his phone is coming to be switched off
[25:06] really! maybe his phone got dead
[25:11] you are right
[25:14] let me tell mom, she was being so upset
[25:18] nowadays she gets worried on small matters
[25:23] Okay
[26:38] what is this problem!
[26:54] it seems the problem is big
[26:57] what shall I do?
[27:24] Mahnoor
[28:16] greetings mom, actually my car broke down so I am standing on the road
[28:20] I've called the cab, it must be coming. But I'll come home after getting my car fixed
[28:27] don't worry, everything is fine. I'll be home within some time
[28:31] yes yes, there isn't any problem
[28:34] yes, bye!
[29:20] actually I need some help because my car broke down. 
[29:23] So, if you can drop me nearby then it would be a great help
[29:34] your entire neighbor knows 
[29:35] that nobody can raise their hand on your wife in front of you 
[29:38] but you can raise your hand & oust her from the house whenever you want to
[29:44] why every girl put false allegation on Faraz?
[29:48] you had said the same thing when his first wife wanted to take the divorce 
[29:51] that she had put a false allegation!
[29:54] although the entire neighbor is a witness & till date they say the same thing
[29:57] that all of you did injustice with that poor girl
[30:01] and she ran away from your house bare head & feet, while saving her life. Also she was injured
[30:38] I don't want help. Thank you! You may go
[31:54] Faraz should change his car now
[31:57] its quite an old one
[31:59] now see, it broke down in the middle of the road. My son must be worried
[32:07] aunty, has Faraz's car broke down?
[32:11] yes, just now I had a word with him. He was telling me that he will be late as his car broke down
[32:17] why? Didn't he call you?
[32:19] No, maybe he had called. I hadn't checked my phone
[32:25] he must be dealing with the mechanic right now
[32:29] my poor son left the office after an entire day, and now he'll get himself tired in this work
[32:35] he bears all the difficulties alone
[32:37] that's why I wanted Maheer to become his support, but Maheer.. .
[32:44] my poor child. Don't know whether he ate or not, don't know in what condition he must be
[33:20] are you fine?
[33:23] I've been observing since evening, that you aren't talking to me properly
[33:29] I'm not feeling well
[33:31] why? what happen?
[33:33] Since I had gone to my house so... 
[33:36] I got tired while cleaning the entire house
[33:42] what was the need to tire yourself?
[33:46] you should have left everything as it is, as we don't live there anymore
[33:52] more than tiredness
[33:54] I am feeling upset
[33:58] upset, why so?
[34:00] I felt so weird by seeing the untidy house
[34:08] I had decorated my house with so much of love
[34:12] by the way, there was no need for the construction
[34:17] Still you.. 
Areeba, you've started again
[34:20] what's the big deal? That house is our property, we'll go there whenever we want to
[34:26] as far as decoration is concerned, if you feel like then start decorating this house
[34:32] let's do one thing, lets order a new furniture for this house
[34:35] No
[34:38] but we are guests here
[34:40] why guests? this house is also ours..
[34:43] I mean, its yours
[34:45] its your father's property. Besides, religiously & rightfully you are the owner of this house
[34:52] yes, I do have a right
[34:54] but along with me, Ramsha & Mahnoor has their share in this house
[35:01] Mahnoor & Ramsha will get nothing from here
[35:04] hmm... 
[35:05] do you know...
[35:08] today I had recalled so many things in that house
[35:12] a lot of past memories
[35:17] I was missing that necklace today
[35:22] necklace?
[35:24] the same necklace
[35:27] that you had gifted me with so much of love
[35:30] and the robbers took it away from me
[35:34] Oh that necklace!
[35:37] it was so beautiful, right?
[35:39] yes
[35:43] I am feeling so sorry
[35:46] anyways, it was meant to go this way. I had explained you earlier as well
[35:50] no problem, I will buy another necklace for you
[35:55] it would be so good if we could have got back the previous one
[35:58] its such an old matter, from where we'll get that necklace now?
[36:03] forget that by considering it as a charity
[36:26] I'm feeling sleepy, let me go & change
[36:45] she came back as an emotional princess after visiting the house
[36:48] foolish woman!
[36:49] but how did she remember the necklace all of a sudden?
[36:55] that necklace was also inside the house, what if she found it
[37:01] where had I kept it, I can't remember
[37:08] No...
[37:10] if she had found it, then she would have told me
[37:14] but she isn't so intelligent
[37:16] that a doubt comes in her heart... 
[37:53] Faraz
[37:55] where were you? You left the office without informing
[38:01] yes, I had to go for some important work
[38:04] for what work you had gone! You left without telling me, you should have at least told me before leaving
[38:14] how I would have told you?
[38:19] you were busy at that time
[38:21] what happened on your hand?
[38:24] nothing, they are dirty
[38:29] actually... 
[38:31] my car broke down on the way, so I was with the mechanic that's why I got late
[38:35] and you phone! why was it switched off?
[38:37] I've been calling you since so long, I was so worried. Do you have an idea?
[38:46] I had switched it off as I didn't wanted to use it
[38:51] are you upset with me?
[38:53] No
[38:58] I thought maybe you don't like Wasay's visit to my office
[39:03] why would I mind?
[39:09] I cannot stop him
[39:13] from coming to the office or into your life
[39:17] you could have stop me
[39:26] I have never stopped anyone till date
[39:30] whoever wanted to leave has left
[39:36] we don't need to stop a person who wants to stay back
[39:51] let me go & wash my hands
