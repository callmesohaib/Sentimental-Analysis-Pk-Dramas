[02:56] which medicine Mahnoor has sent?
[03:01] I don't need any medicine
[03:07] I had lied to you because I wanted to meet Ramsha
[03:18] how can you come to meet her like this?
[03:21] you don't know that she... 
I know
[03:29] but what shall I do?
[03:32] I had become so helpless & compelled, that's why
[03:39] please look...
[03:42] just give me two minutes to talk to Ramsha
[03:47] only 2 minutes!
[03:50] Ramsha, are you listening to what I am saying to you?
[03:57] Ramsha look, I know that you are listening to me
[04:02] I just wanted to apologize to you
[04:11] I know that I took wrong advantage of your innocence
[04:23] I didn't know that...
[04:25] the consequences of the game that I was playing with you will be so bad in the future
[04:32] you got into this condition because of me, you are suffering because of me
[04:43] what do you mean?
[04:46] I...
[04:50] Ramsha, I wasn't in love with you
[04:59] I wanted to take the revenge of my insult from sister Mahnoor
[05:09] because of which I had used your innocence & love as a weapon
[05:22] Ramsha, if possible please forgive me. What I could do as I didn't had any other option at that time
[05:31] Ramsha, I am so sorry. Please forgive me
[05:34] I did a very big mistake
[05:57] Ramsha, please!
Maheer
[06:02] you can leave now
[07:12] now keep waiting for me for lifetime, Fariya
I will never come back
[07:18] not only this city, but you won't see me in this country
[07:43] Rameez's car is not here
[07:47] Fariya
[07:49] Fariya!
[07:50] yes
[07:53] where is Rameez? I didn't see him since morning
[07:55] Rameez? He has gone to the travel agent for the tickets. What happen?
[07:59] Okay
[08:01] have you taken all the money from him?
[08:03] No! its with him
[08:08] but he wouldn't be roaming around with it, he is here
[08:11] yes
[08:13] and what about jewelry?
[08:18] mom, what's with you? Everything is inside the cupboard
[08:23] I am saying you for my satisfaction
[08:26] Ok listen, don't trust a lot on Rameez
[08:30] a person's intention can change anytime
[08:34] money is such a bad thing
[08:37] for sure you are worried about your share
[08:40] what's with you, Fariya? are we not together?
[08:44] Go, go & check if the jewelry is fine
[08:47] let me check for your satisfaction
[09:11] mom!
[09:13] what happen?
[09:15] the bag is not there inside the cupboard, did you take it?
What!
[09:18] why will I take it? Have you gone mad?
[09:20] so where can the bag go from the cupboard?
[09:22] I've been explaining you since so long, and asking you that where have you kept it
[09:26] Come, let me see it myself
[09:28] that's why I was asking you to be careful. You trust everyone
[09:32] I had kept it here, how would I know that...
[09:34] what shall we do now?
why will he do this to us?
[09:40] let me do one thing, let me try calling Rameez
[09:43] yes yes, quickly go & try calling. Maybe he had kept it somewhere
[09:53] his phone is coming to be switched off
[09:56] mom! Rameez's phone is off
[09:59] what will happen now? My God!
[10:03] there is something fishy!
[10:05] there is something fishy...
[10:10] Faraz
[10:11] yes
[10:13] dear, I was waiting for you. Please talk to Maheer
[10:17] Ask him that what is he trying to do with himself. Why is he doing this to me?
[10:23] mom, I'll talk to Maheer please don't worry about it. But right now I am worried about something else
[10:31] What does Yasir wants?
[10:34] Why, what Yasir did?
[10:38] from the day he has joined office
[10:40] I am getting his complaints on daily basis
[10:45] Why! What complain does the office have with Yasir?
[10:50] mom look, the office is not of our father
[10:54] we cannot do everything as per our will
[10:56] if you'll daily come late to the office & will fight with your seniors, then eventually there will be complains
[11:04] dear, ask them to explain him with love. He will understand
[11:08] and you don't say anything to him
[11:11] he is like your younger brother
[11:13] if my younger brother's professional behavior had been like this, then I would have pushed him out first
[11:20] a person can tolerate relations & generosity inside the home, but not professionally
[11:28] convey my message to him
[11:38] Ramsha, I am so sorry please forgive me
I did a very big mistake
[13:21] I knew it that Maheer wanted to take revenge from us
[13:25] and he was doing that to humiliate me
[13:29] that's why I had rejected this proposal at that time
[13:32] I didn't like it, otherwise...
[13:37] Maheer had used me to take revenge from you guys
[13:44] and because of brother Saqlain, my life became a living hell
[13:47] after all, what was my sin
[13:51] that I've become the prey of the contumacy & enmity of both of you
[13:57] I didn't had any personal clash with Maheer
[14:00] if you hadn't gone home directly from the university on that day then
[14:07] I was just worried about you, I was worried about your honor
[14:12] it was you who was blinded in his love
[14:22] Mahnoor
[14:25] whatever Ramsha is saying, let her say
[14:29] her complain is justified
[14:38] we did a mistake in taking care of her
[14:52] by the way....
[14:55] I saw guilt & shame in Maheer's eyes
[15:06] you are right
[15:09] honestly Maheer has changed a lot
[15:12] he has changed a lot, he isn't like previous Maheer
[15:18] he stays very quiet, also he minds his own business
[15:23] and since Ramsha has got married
[15:25] he stays inside his room, he doesn't come out of his room
[15:35] that's why aunty is also quite worried about Maheer
[15:49] maybe he stays restless because of his guilt
[16:00] that's why he came to apologize to Ramsha
[16:04] otherwise, Ramsha wouldn't have got to know about these things in her entire life
[16:18] Mahnoor
[16:22] I am thinking to get Ramsha & Maheer...
[16:27] stop it!
[16:29] for God sake stop it! Don't think about me anymore
[16:32] Ramsha... Ramsha!
[16:39] for God sake! I beg you guys
[16:44] already my mockery has been done, now for God sake forgive me
[16:55] please
[17:22] Mahnoor
[17:30] I want to discuss something important with you
[17:33] it had slipped out of my mind because of Ramsha
[17:37] do you know any lawyer?
[17:41] why are you asking about a lawyer?
[17:45] We have lawyer who handles all of our cases
[17:53] No, I want to meet a good family lawyer
[17:59] try to find out one for me
[18:02] what are you trying to do?
[18:09] what you are understanding...
[18:13] its the same thing
[18:17] now go home, you are getting late
[18:21] and do call me after reaching home
[18:24] otherwise I will stay worried for you
[18:29] sister, take care of yourself, Ramsha & of the baby
[19:37] Maheer had used me to take revenge from you people
[19:42] and because of brother Saqlain, my life became a living hell
[19:46] after all. what was my sin
[19:50] that I became the prey of the contumacy & enmity of both of you
[20:12] I think, the life of both of my sisters got ruined because of me
[20:22] if I wouldn't have been there, then nothing as such would have happened with them
[20:27] why are you thinking like this?
[20:30] because this is the truth
[20:33] No, its not the truth Mahnoor
[20:38] Maheer had gone to apologize to Ramsha
[20:44] He has told the entire truth to Ramsha
[20:47] that he was fooling Ramsha just to humiliate me
[20:58] I have never kept any malice in my heart for Maheer
[21:03] but I like it
[21:07] that he told the truth to Ramsha & accepted his mistake
[21:12] nobody becomes small by accepting their mistakes
[21:17] that's why I am also accepting my mistake
[21:20] but there isn't any fault of yours in it, Mahnoor
[21:25] you were protecting Ramsha in all of this
[21:29] and then its your farsightedness... 
my mother always used to say
[21:33] that I will break Areeba's family
[21:36] she always used to say to me
[21:38] that Mahi the way you speak the entire truth without any hesitation
[21:43] also you don't care about anything
[21:45] I fear, what if you break Areeba's family
[21:53] today...
[21:55] I think that everything is happening because of me whatever my mother used to say
[22:03] Areeba is seeking a family lawyer for herself
[22:07] she was asking me to find a family lawyer for her
[22:13] So, do you want sister Areeba to keep her name attached to a shallow & fraudster person like Saqlain?
[22:23] he is a cheater, Mahnoor!
[22:28] what not he did with you & Ramsha. Leave it
but he..
[22:32] he has shattered sister Areeba's trust as well
[22:38] Do you still think that there is any way out in their relation?
[22:43] sister Areeba...
[22:47] She was truly in love with brother Saqlain
[22:52] today, when she was saying this to me
[22:56] I didn't understand...
[22:59] how come she became so brave
[23:03] As per my opinion, Saqlain has removed this fear from her
[23:08] if he hadn't taken off his veil in front of her, then maybe sister Areeba wouldn't have been so brave today
[23:13] you aren't at fault in this, Mahnoor
[23:20] I have an idea that what you must be thinking right now
[23:26] You are worried because of Ramsha & sister Areeba, right?
[23:33] you are thinking that how will their future life will be spent, what will they do
[23:40] I don't understand anything
[23:48] As happiness doesn't stays forever
[23:52] the same way bad times & difficulties doesn't stay forever
[24:00] no matter how dark the night is
[24:03] next day, the sunrise comes over the darkness
[24:12] there will be brightness, even if we stay hopeless
[24:17] happiness will come for sure
[24:20] everything will be fine, Mahnoor
[25:32] what is the matter, why aren't you going to the university?
[25:37] actually brother Faraz...
[25:38] do you remember how hard it was to get your readmission done
[25:43] also do you remember that next month are your final exams
[25:49] don't worry, I have done the preparation of my exams
[25:57] already your attendance is short
[26:00] who misses their classes in such times?
[26:10] you have already removed the burden that you had on your heart
[26:16] brother, I've set my conscience free from this guilt
[26:22] but the disbelief of her eyes
[26:27] make me realize my sin
[26:35] Maheer, Ramsha isn't your problem
[26:40] mom is so worried about you
[26:47] she has some hopes with you and if you won't fulfill them then do you know how upset she will be?
[26:53] brother, I don't do this deliberately
[26:57] I want that nobody shall be hurt by my existence
[27:05] look, whatever is going on in your mind. Just leave its decision on the time
[27:12] just focus on your future right now
[27:24] look, if you listen to me & mom right now
[27:29] then I assure you that...
[27:32] I will support you on the right time
[28:02] I wanted to take the revenge of my insult from sister Mahnoor
[28:07] because of which I had used your innocence & love as a weapon
[28:16] was it important to dishonor my love in order to take your revenge?
[28:29] madam, come & have lunch
[28:38] I don't want to eat
[28:39] please don't do this, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[28:42] and sister Areeba, already she is not eating anything
[28:47] madam, I do realize your pain but madam Areeba needs you
[28:51] if your mother would have been alive today, then think how much care she must have done of her
[28:56] she used to pray a lot for her
[28:59] also, she used to ask me to pray for her
[29:02] if our mother would have been alive then our lives wouldn't have been destroyed like this
[29:08] madam, everything is written in a person's fate
[29:11] one should be thankful to God that somehow the difficult time has passed
[29:15] and you do care about your sisters. Please come & ask her to have lunch
[29:40] Tea
[29:42] No
[29:51] give me this cup
[29:55] please sit
[30:01] by the way, you people don't respect Yasir at all
[30:07] He is your to be son-in-law, and who does this with their to be son-in-law?
[30:12] oh no, its not the matter. Mahnoor, bring juice for Yasir
[30:18] Okay, shall I bring juice or coffee for you?
[30:22] I want nothing, I am not in a mood for anything
[30:30] what is the matter, dear Yasir. You seem bit upset
[30:35] No..
[30:37] Yasir is upset with all of you
[30:43] but we should know that why he is upset
[30:48] whatever you & brother Faraz are doing with me in the office, is that reason less?
[30:55] I think, we should keep the office matters to office
[30:59] those matters shouldn't be brought at home
[31:08] Secondly, Mahnoor & I mind our own business in the office. So you do the same, that's it!
[31:13] did you see? He misbehaves with me in the same manner on daily basis
[31:18] by taunting me he wants to prove that he did some big favor on me
[31:22] although I got the job on my educational basis but..
[31:25] Its ok dear, if they have helped you in this matter then its not some big favor
[31:31] even you are doing a favor on them by marrying Aima
[31:45] what are you saying? Favor!
[31:47] what else? Yasir doesn't have any lacking of girls
[31:51] he is still getting the proposals of rich & well-educated girls
[32:05] So, we didn't came to you to seek the proposal?
[32:08] you people came to our house yourself to seek Aima's proposal
[32:14] Mahnoor, be quiet!
[32:17] don't interfere in this matter
[32:22] and Aima is just inter pass, she isn't an officer like you
[32:27] So?
[32:29] We hadn't hid this matter with you
[32:35] Aima wasn't allowed to continue her studies because her marriage got fixed
[32:39] even today she wants to take an admission in the university
[32:42] if she completes her studies then she can also become an officer like me or a big officer than me
[32:47] She doesn't lack any quality
[32:52] She is such an illiterate and crazy girl. Neither she have any mind or intelligence
[32:57] she can never become an officer
[33:04] talk with respect about my sister
[33:06] So what special qualities does your sister have?
[33:15] he is right! Your sister is an ordinary looking girl
[33:18] nobody will look at your sister if we don't come to marry her
[33:22] therefore, lower your eyes & head while talking
[33:24] why shall we lower our eyes?
[33:27] you ask for the car in the dowry, and we shall lower our eyes?
[33:34] your worthless son is of no use though
[33:39] I get his complains in the office on daily basis
[33:43] but we are tolerating, we haven't said anything ever
[33:47] are you listening? Your daughter-in-law doesn't want your daughter to get married in a good family
[33:52] As far as dowry is concerned, everyone gives it to their daughters. You guys aren't doing any favor!
[33:58] and whatever you people are saying about Aima, shall we stay quiet after listening to it?
[34:13] get up!
[34:24] whether my daughter gets married into a good family or not
[34:27] its her fate
[34:30] but I have realized my mistake
[34:33] I did one mistake after another by listening to your demands
[34:44] therefore, I call off my daughter's & your son's engagement
[34:59] you people may leave
Leave!
[37:20] Areeba, I was sure that you will come to meet me here
[37:26] don't worry! I will divorce Fariya
[37:36] Besides, I don't have any relation with her anymore
[37:39] just ask Mahnoor to end this case & forgive me
[37:44] you also forgive me, for the sake of our child
[37:50] I came to file a divorce case
[38:07] these are the papers
[38:20] sign them after the birth of my baby
[38:27] me & my child doesn't have any relation with you
[38:34] and I will not let you see my child's face for your entire life
