[01:34] Greetings.
[01:36] Greetings.
[01:39] Greetings to you too. Come in you two.
[01:49] Mother, you're alone? Where's sister Areeba, has she left?
[01:53] My dear, she just left... Saqlain wanted to stay but asked them to leave.
[02:01] They were running late.
What happened to you? You don't seem well to me.
[02:06] Are you alright?
Yes, I am... don't worry about me.
[02:11] But you don't seem well.
It's just that I'm having a little difficulty breathing.
[02:20] Mother, did you take your medicine?
Yes, my dear.
[02:24] The medicine is right here. I ate it just before you guys arrived.
[02:29] Then?
Let's take you to the doctor.
[02:36] My dear... you'll find no doctor at this hour.
The emergency is open twenty-four hours.
[02:44] Faraz is right. Get up, we're going to the doctor.
[02:48] Mahi... my dear child, I'm perfectly fine. Why are you worrying so much about me?
[02:55] I'm telling you that I'm fine, I don't want to go anywhere.
[03:01] Mahnoor, you should stay here tonight.
[03:07] Yes, I'll stay here with mother tonight.
[03:11] No... both of you go home. You guys had to come here because of Ramsha.
[03:17] There are so many things to do at one's home at this hour. I just took my medicine and I'm starting to feel better.
[03:22] But mother...
Mahi, why are you being stubborn? Ramsha is here with me.
[03:28] You don't seem well to me. If anything happens you'll call me, right?
[03:34] Alright, my dear... I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry about me at all, alright?
[03:41] We'll get going then. I'll ask Ramsha to keep your medicine by your side table.
[03:46] I'll ask her to feed you something as well... because you don't take care of yourself.
[03:51] Now rest up and go to sleep.
[03:56] Sure... I'll sleep in a while. I feel better.
[04:01] Farewell.
[04:04] Farewell*
[05:02] Mahnoor...
[05:05] God willing, she'll be fine.
[05:54] Ramsha... you didn't tell me how the engagement went by... everything was fine, right?
[06:03] Everything was fine...
Did sister Shehla and Aima like the gifts you gave them?
[06:10] What do you mean? They didn't open it there and then.
[06:17] You can ask sister Mahnoor that.
Yes, I'll ask her.
[06:30] Ramsha... Ramsha...
[06:34] I can't breathe...
What do you mean you can't breathe?
[06:39] I can't breathe...
What's happening... mother... mother!
[06:45] Mother... mother... mother... you can't breathe...
[06:53] Wait a minute, I'm calling sister Mahnoor.
[07:01] Sister Mahnoor... I don't know what happened to mother. Please come home.
[07:09] Yes... come here immediately... hurry up...
Please...
[07:14] Mother...
[07:40] Thank God... that everything went well.
[07:45] But I didn't like how Faraz went to drop Ramsha on his wife's say-so.
[07:53] Who would have dropped her then?
We had so many guests.
[07:58] He could have gone later.
It was midnight and auntie wasn't feeling well.
[08:07] Mother... mother... Mahnoor and I are leaving. Auntie has gotten unwell all of a sudden.
[08:17] Alright...
Okay.
[08:21] Do you see how they are leaving so early in the morning?
What's with your mother... he told you that auntie's unwell.
[08:30] God... it seems that he only listens to his in-laws now.
[09:11] This has happened twice since yesterday.
[09:21] When I take this medicine... I feel suffocated...
[09:26] I feel anxious and my heart feels heavy.
[09:37] The doctor has prescribed her this medicine.
[09:41] But... son... I have always been taking this medicine.
[09:50] How can it be that the medicine isn't improving your health?
[09:55] Rather, you're feeling suffocated.
[10:01] This could be a reaction from this medicine as well.
[10:06] I mean, often it happens that a certain medicine doesn't suit a certain person.
[10:10] It's better that we refer this to the doctor. If this medicine isn't suiting you, they'll provide you with an alternative.
[10:19] I told you earlier that you should go to the hospital, but you didn't listen to me.
[10:25] But Mahi...
Enough mother...
[10:27] I think we shouldn't delay this any longer, we should take her to the hospital.
[10:35] I don't want things to go bad.
[10:38] We're going to the hospital right now... I will not listen to you at all.
[10:43] We're going to the hospital right now...  I've listened to you enough.
[10:49] You're getting worse. Get up.
[10:55] Mahi... you're doing this needlessly. I'm fine.
[11:19] Enough Saqlain, I don't want to eat more.
[11:22] You haven't eaten at all...
I can't eat anymore.
[11:29] I will not tolerate anything like this, you have to be very careful. Your health is attached to the health of our child.
[11:37] You're worrying for me because of the baby, otherwise, you don't care.
What do you mean I don't care?
[11:46] You have no idea... I can't even get my mind on work nowadays.
[11:50] I think about you all the time.
[11:55] Fariya... my dear... Ramiz is here.
[12:00] Ramiz is here?
[12:03] Sit him down... we'll be just down.
Alright.
[12:08] You remember your promise, right?
What need is there for this Fariya?
[12:15] I told you that I'm willing to invest...
Please Saqlain this has already been settled between us.
[12:21] Don't argue with me. I said I'll have a business of my own and I'll do exactly that.
[12:25] Alright fine... finish this first and then you can meet him.
[12:31] Open up...
No.. first agree with what I said. 
[12:34] I have, now open up your mouth.
[12:36] Sure?
Yes...
[12:40] Let's go...
We'll leave after you finish this.
[12:50] It's out of the question that this medicine causes a reaction.
Then, what is the reason?
[12:54] Mother was perfectly fine, then how come all of a sudden she's like this?
We'll investigate this problem, don't worry.
[13:01] But remove all doubt that she becomes unwell because of this medicine.
[13:06] This medicine is trialed and tested. No side effects have ever been recorded regarding this medicine.
[13:11] It's safe.
[13:12] But we can't ignore this. Not once but twice she has had problems breathing after she took her medicine.
[13:20] Besides she's a heart patient.
[13:21] We have had some tests done, they'll be back in a couple of hours. After they come back we'll be able to come to a conclusion.
[14:07] Your investment plan is good and the good thing is that the investment you want is not that much.
[14:13] There is a lot of profit in this as well. How much will you invest?
[14:19] Fifty... fifty. We decided that we would be equal partners.
[14:25] Meaning that Fariya's investment will be fifty lacs.
Yes.
[14:29] Do you guys have a location in mind? Where will your boutique be located?
[14:33] We have a couple of prime locations that I've seen...
[14:39] We can choose one from either of them.
[14:43] If that's the case, finalize the location as soon as it's possible.
[14:51] Fariya asked this of me and I can't refuse her.
[14:57] Thank you...
My pleasure.
[15:06] Excuse me...
[15:09] Hello...
[15:15] What do you mean? What happened to her health?
[15:20] They got so unwell that Faraz and Mahnoor had to take her to the hospital?
[15:31] Alright, don't worry. I'm coming.
[15:40] Saqlain...
[15:45] Where did he go?
[15:48] Where else than that one place?
[15:53] He ruined our entire plan. Stupid.
[16:17] What did the doctor say?
They're waiting for her test results...
[16:22] After that, she'll be treated.
[16:29] What happened to her?
[16:32] Mother had been unwell since yesterday. Mahnoor and Faraz brought her here.
[16:36] She was unwell since yesterday and no one thought to inform us?
[16:41] She wasn't that unwell yesterday, but she got worse today.
[16:44] I'll go and talk to the doctor.
We've already talked to the doctor.
[16:50] She said that we'll learn what the problem is after the test results come back.
[17:24] I'll be right back.
[17:37] What does mother's reports say?
[17:38] Your mother's report is alarming. It's showing a chemical that's harmful to her body.
[17:44] What?
But, how can that be?
[17:48] It's written in this report.
That means that my mother has ingested something poisonous?
[17:58] It's possible.
It's also possible that her medicine was tainted with this poison.
[18:08] Because whenever she took this medicine her health got worse.
[18:12] Doctor, this is the medicine you prescribed.
[18:16] Why aren't you guys understanding that this medicine has nothing to do with this?
[18:20] Then what other reason can it be?
[18:22] Millions of people use this medicine, but there has never been such a case. I think her medicine is being laced with poison...
[18:28] or she is being fed poison separately.
[18:33] Right now, she needs to be treated and we don't have any time to lose.
[18:37] Why are you talking to us then? Start her treatment immediately.
[18:41] Mahnoor... send me all the medicine that miss Sarah was using, so that I can send it for testing in the lab.
[18:48] So that you may be satisfied that the medicine we prescribed her, was not harmful to her.
[19:05] I'll bring those medicine for you.
[19:09] I just want my mother to be treated well.
I'll try my utmost best.
[19:48] Faraz, I'll take these medicine to the lab. You can go home.
[19:54] Why should I go home? Your mother's in the hospital and at such a time I can't leave you here.
[20:00] Brother Saqlain is here with us at the hospital. You've been away from home for a while now. You need to look at matters there as well.
[20:07] You have your mother as well.
Don't worry about my mother. You're already so stressed.
[20:14] I talk to mother constantly. She knows about this emergency. Don't worry.
[20:24] Shall we?
Let me keep this in my bag.
[21:44] Where are the medicines?
[21:49] Salma... Salma...
[21:54] Salma!
[21:57] Yes, brother Saqlain?
Where's auntie's medicine?
[22:01] I think sister Mahnoor has already taken them with her.
[22:05] Mahnoor...
She came here a while ago. I saw the medicine with her.
[22:11] Brother Saqlain, sister Mahnoor asked to make food for everyone. If you could wait five minutes, it will be ready and I'll pack it up for you.
[23:48] Where's Mahnoor?
She's gone out with Faraz to take care of something.
[23:55] Gone out?
[23:58] Your mother is fighting life and death, but your sister is roaming around.
[24:06] Slowly... it might be something important.
It's strange...
[24:12] Your sister does not care about your mother at all. They've left her here.
[24:21] We are responsible for everything. Ramsha and Mahnoor are not capable of handling any responsibility.
[24:27] She's roaming out with her husband.
I've sent Ramsha to the cafeteria for tea.
[24:33] For tea? Is this a picnic?
Why are you being so angry?
[24:39] What happened to mother's reports? Mahnoor didn't tell me anything as well. She just left.
[24:47] Auntie's reports...
[24:57] Where did you two go? Why are you two so late? I was worried. Do you guys realize your responsibilities?
[25:03] Is mother fine?
[25:07] Yes, the doctors gave her an injection. She asked us...
[25:12] not to leave her alone, even for a second. Where did you two go?
[25:18] I went to have mother's medicine lab tested.
[25:25] Lab test, for what?
[25:34] The doctor suspects that mother's medicines are laced with medicine, that's why they want to check her medicine.
[25:46] They want to find the poisonous chemical that is making her sick.
[25:56] They want to make sure that there isn't anything like that in her medicine.
[26:03] That will be cleared once the reports are back.
[27:00] Don't worry, God willing, auntie will be fine soon.
[27:04] If God is willing.
[27:10] Relax...
[27:16] Brother, don't worry. I'll tell mother everything.
[27:20] Just take care of sister Mahnoor. Farewell.
[27:30] Hello...
I've been trying to reach you for a while...
[27:34] but your number was engaged.
[27:37] Yes...
Don't you recognize me? It's Yasir.
[27:42] No, I did... I saw your number...
Yes, I decided to see how you were doing...
[27:49] but your phone was busy, so I got irritated. Who were you talking to for so long?
[27:57] I was talking to brother Faraz... sister Mahnoor's mother is not feeling well. That's why he didn't come home today.
[28:03] It seems that you like talking for long hours on the phone.
[28:09] But I've never seen you talk to someone for long.
It depends on the nature of the conversation. I don't like talking needlessly.
[28:16] But I like listening to you.
[28:18] That's why you can say whatever you want to me... but try not to keep your phone engaged for so long.
[28:26] But now I can call you at any time.
Sure. I have to give brother Faraz's message to my mother. I'll talk to you later.
[28:35] Alright fine, messaged me. If I'm free I'll call you.
Farewell.
[28:51] Did you talk to Faraz?
Yes...
[28:57] Brother Faraz said that he won't be coming today. Sister Mahnoor's mother is not well at all.
[29:03] He'll stay there. Sister Mahnoor is very upset.
[29:08] That's all he cares about. He won't leave her, even if it means cutting himself from the world.
[29:15] My poor son must be in dire condition from being at the hospital since morning.
[29:19] That selfish woman didn't even think of sending him home so that he can rest.
[29:29] Go ahead and pray.
[29:53] Should I bring you something to eat?
[30:39] Auntie will be perfectly fine.
[30:43] The doctors have started the treatment.
[30:47] There's no danger.
[30:50] You're brave and strong...
[30:53] Be strong for just a little while longer.
[30:57] You'll see auntie...
[31:01] By tomorrow morning she'll be back home.
[31:22] Hello...
Saqlain, where are you?
[31:25] Where else can I be but in trouble?
[31:29] What trouble? Is everything fine?
[31:33] These women have made my life hell. I'm in the hospital with this old hag.
[31:42] Saqlain, you still care about Areeba and her mother. You don't care about me and my soon-to-be-born child.
[31:49] Whether we live or die.
What foolish things are you saying?
[31:53] Why wouldn't I care about you and my child? I've waited years for this moment.
[32:00] I've gotten such good news after such a long time, won't I be happy?
[32:04] What should I do about this old hag? I can't leave her here to come to you.
[32:11] Lord knows when she'll die.
I tried killing her by lacing her medicine with poison.
[32:19] She's been a bother for such a long time. I decided that when she would die I would take over her house, on which I have always had my eyes.
[32:31] But...
[32:33] But what?
Blood reports have caught a trace of that poison.
[32:38] Mahnoor has already sent the medicine to be tested.
[32:42] I don't understand how I will handle this situation. They'll know that the medicine was laced with poison.
[32:51] Saqlain...
[32:55] Auntie... why did you remove your mask?
[32:59] All these years I was unable to see your true face.
What are you saying, auntie?
[33:08] It seems that the medicine has affected your brain.
[33:12] No... nothing has happened to me.
[33:16] Nothing has happened to me... I heard everything you were saying.
[33:24] You betrayed me...
[33:29] Such a great betrayal.
[33:34] You married someone else.
[33:37] And... you have a child as well.
[33:41] Such a great betrayal.
I always treated you like a son, why did you do this to me?
[33:51] Auntie, you have a misunderstanding.
[33:55] I've just now started seeing the truth.
[33:59] It's my fault that I...
[34:04] trusted you so much.
[34:07] Saqlain... I thought of you like a son and you...
[34:17] What did you do to me? Why did you do this to me?
[34:24] You wanted money...
[34:30] You wanted my money... that's why you poisoned me.
[34:39] Mahi... Mahi...
[34:43] Mahi... was right. I never believed what Mahi said.
[34:53] I believed you Saqlain...
[35:00] Mahi... Mahi...
[35:03] Mahi was right. Mahi.. Mahi... Mahi.
[35:12] Mahi... Mahi...
[36:29] Look at her... nothing's active.
[36:36] Please look at her.
What happened to you? Wake up.
[37:20] Brother Saqlain...
[37:23] What happened to mother?
It was a heart attack.
[37:38] Heart attack?
[37:42] But how?
[37:44] I don't know, when I went to her room she was in a dire state. I called the doctor...
[38:13] What happened to her?
Mother...
[38:20] Please be okay.
[38:33] What happened?
[38:35] I'm sorry.
[38:52] Mother...
[38:54] Mother...
[38:56] Mother... mother open up your eyes. What happened to you?
[39:02] Mother, talk to me... you can't leave me like this. Talk to me.
[39:09] You can't leave...
Mahnoor... what happened to her?
[39:12] Mother isn't saying anything.
Mother...
[39:16] Where's the staff? Mother open up your eyes...
[39:21] Mother... see what happened to her?
[39:26] Mother... she's not opening up her eyes.
[39:31] Mother...
No... no...
[39:36] No... you can't leave us like this. Please talk to me.
