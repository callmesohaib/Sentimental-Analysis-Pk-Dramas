[00:59] aunty, I hadn't lied. I saw Maheer
[01:02] yes yes, Ok I accept that all of us are liars & only you are the sincere person in this entire world
[01:15] Go, leave me now
[01:19] and listen to me both of you! Next time lock your room before leaving the house
[01:25] I or Aima will not get your room cleaned, get it cleaned yourself
[01:30] in fact, we won't step inside your room
[01:35] mom, now leave this topic
[01:38] Ok, I will leave it
[01:40] oh dear, if you say so then we shall leave this house for your wife's happiness
[01:47] mom, what's with you what are you saying? I didn't mean this
[01:51] it wasn't yours, but your wife's intentions are like this
[01:53] she doesn't want me or your sister to live in this house with you
[02:00] Aunty, why will I think this way?
[02:04] the way Faraz is important for me, the same way all of you are
[02:08] I have always tried to stay together happily
[02:12] I can see your efforts, that what do you want
[02:18] now leave, don't stand on my head. I can make the food myself
[02:27] No, I always cook the dinner so even today I will do the cooking
[02:31] really! if you want to cook then make it for your husband as I won't eat anything cooked by you
[02:39] mom, can't you end your anger for my sake?
[02:43] oh dear, we are tolerating these blames or robbery because of yo. What else shall we do?
[02:51] Fine
[02:54] I made a mistake aunty, I shouldn't have blamed anyone without thinking
[03:00] I should have checked inside my room first
[03:04] it won't happen next time
[03:07] I'm sorry!
[03:12] hmm... 
[03:40] what happen to you? You seem worried, why are you crying?
[03:45] Saqlain
[03:47] what Saqlain? Where is he? Isn't he home?
[03:50] the police has arrested him
[03:54] what do you mean that the police has arrested him?
[03:57] Mahnoor has filed a report against him
[04:00] where the police took brother Saqlain? I mean which police station?
[04:05] I don't know, also his number is coming to be switched off
[04:09] don't know what does sister Mahnoor do
[04:13] I had explained her a lot, if she had to do this then what's the point of explaining?
[04:17] God knows what enmity does she have with Saqlain
[04:21] when mom was alive, she used to stop her. She has started to show her true colors after her demise
[04:27] don't know for what she is taking revenge from us. What wrong we did with her!
[04:33] Okay, don't worry let me speak to sister
[04:39] there is no need of it, I have already talked. It doesn't make any difference to her
[04:45] if it would have made any difference on her, then by now Saqlain would have come back home
[04:52] oh God! Okay, stop crying. Let me see what can I do. But at least stop crying
[05:06] Faraz, please leave me alone for a while
[05:15] this is the problem
[05:19] I cannot leave you
[05:23] I don't want to talk anyone right now
[05:26] I want to stay alone
[05:36] don't know... 
[05:38] why everything is becoming wrong
[05:41] I'm becoming a sinner in front of all
[05:44] nobody believes me
[05:47] nobody is with me
[05:51] I've become all alone
[05:54] I'm with you
[05:57] whether you do right or wrong, good or bad... 
[06:02] I will always support you, I will never leave you alone
[06:08] you will support me though
[06:11] but you won't believe me
[06:16] a support is done on the basis of trust
[06:20] if we don't trust someone, we don't hold their hand
[06:24] but you were denying my words
[06:28] you had denied me here & there... 
[06:32] you had scolded me a lot on the matter of doing a case on brother Saqlain
[06:40] I was trying to make you realize your mistake
[06:44] supporting each other doesn't mean to defend each other mistakes
[06:48] You & I cannot be sincere to each other, until unless we tell each other's flaws in person
[06:53] do tell me wherever I am wrong
[06:59] rest... 
[07:01] the way you had apologized to my right now
[07:07] I had never demanded this from you
[07:10] rest whatever you did was right
[07:13] but... 
[07:15] if you wouldn't have apologized, still I would have fixed mom's mood in a day or so
[07:20] and she would have agreed, her mood would have fixed
[07:22] she would have forgotten her anger for my sake
[07:42] please stop crying
[08:20] I don't understand anything, whom shall we seek help in this matter
[08:25] I don't understand anything. Don't know whether Saqlain could have contacted his lawyer or not
[08:35] sister, shall I call brother Faraz?
[08:41] try doing it
[08:44] I don't expect anything good from him, he is way too worse than Mahnoor
[08:48] both of them are doing this together
[08:51] No... this is not the matter. Yesterday brother Faraz was explaining sister Mahnoor
[08:56] I'm sure he will help us. Let me call him, Ok?
[09:00] do whatever you want to do
[09:02] but I don't expect anything good from both of them
[09:14] oh God, what shall I do?
[09:17] what shall I do?
[09:19] let me speak to Hashir
[09:22] No, no... 
[09:25] what respect will be left in their eyes, aunt already taunts me a lot
[09:30] oh God, what shall I do?
[09:33] don't know in what condition Saqlain must be!
[09:38] why aren't you eating ice-cream? it will melt
[09:40] I've eaten a lot of food, I don't have anymore space
[09:43] one always have a space for an ice cream, come on... eat it 
[09:48] what's the matter? you look quite happy today
[09:53] I am always happen whenever I am with you
[09:57] my heart feels satisfied after seeing you
[10:01] Ok tell me, when is your next doctor's appointment?
[10:04] I was a bit busy in the past few days, so I forgot to ask you
[10:07] the appointment is next week. Don't you worry, I will go with mom
[10:15] I know you are quite a busy person
[10:17] Besides, you have a lot of problems. Like Areeba & her sisters issues
[10:25] I have a lot of time for you
[10:29] do text me the date & timings of your appointment. I will come
[10:36] Okay
yes?
[10:39] ice cream... 
[10:44] he is always discussing the same thing.
How shall I get rid of this fake pregnancy?
[10:52] Ramsha, please don't worry
[10:54] brother Faraz, how can I not worry?
[10:57] the police has arrested brother Saqlain since morning. Also, we don't even know that which police station he is in
[11:03] let me ask Mahnoor
[11:05] don't know how can sister Mahnoor be so cold hearted
[11:08] does she have any idea that in what condition sister Areeba is?
[11:12] she has been crying since morning
[11:20] only one peaceful night had passed and now even the neighbors have got to know that the police has arrested brother Saqlain
[11:28] and... 
[11:30] and what if someone came into our house tonight as well, then?
[11:34] I & Mahnoor will come over there to you guys
[11:37] No... don't bring sister Mahnoor here, otherwise sister Areeba will do something in real
[11:44] just ask sister Mahnoor to take the case back
[11:47] Okay, let me talk to Mahnoor once again
[11:57] Mahnoor
[11:58] Faraz!
[12:00] I won't take this case back
[12:04] absolutely not!
[12:05] your sisters are so worried, do you have any idea?
[12:09] yes, I don't have any idea. I am very selfish, I just think about myself. I don't care about anyone's grief or so
[12:17] the police has filed our complaint, right?
[12:19] if brother Saqlain is innocent then he will be released
[12:22] yes, he will be released because you don't have any proof against him
[12:25] Faraz
[12:27] come with me right away
[12:35] do you know, who will be in the most painful situation to see all three of you sisters fighting?
[12:43] the same person, who had prayed for the happiness of the three of you in her life
[12:49] she must be in a lot of pain
[12:53] Mahnoor, we shouldn't give pain to mothers
[12:56] neither in their life nor after their death
[13:02] if we have to leave the fight of right for them
[13:07] still its not a defeat but victory
[13:55] listen... do one thing
[13:58] yes sir, order me
[14:01] beat me
[14:02] Sir, what are you saying? How can I... 
[14:05] beat me
[14:07] Sir...
beat me!
[14:15] over here
[14:18] hey beat me!
[14:27] Ok go, go away... 
[15:07] Areeba
[15:10] Areeba... 
[15:12] thanks God you are back
[15:15] what happened? who did this to you?
[15:20] who else will do this, Areeba? the police did it
[15:25] they wanted me to confess the crime
[15:28] they had beaten me a lot
[15:30] they wanted me to confess that I had added poison to aunt's medicines
[15:35] No... 
[15:37] what is this cruelty?
[15:39] they wanted me to confess that I had killed my mother
[15:45] my mother... 
[16:06] *greetings!*
[16:09] where is Ramsha & sister Areeba?
[16:11] madam, both of them are inside the room & brother Saqlain... 
[16:25] both of them have gone again?
[16:28] mom, I had told you that they have to go to sister Mahnoor's house
[16:32] God knows when Mahnoor's parents house visits will end
[16:36] earlier, I had thought that since her mother is unwell that's why she is doing frequent visits
[16:39] but this isn't getting over
[16:42] mom, her visits are never ending
[16:45] in fact, now she is fooling all of us around in this matter
[16:48] Maheer, sister Mahnoor has already apologized to mom
[16:53] and she has accepted her mistake too
[16:55] therefore, if you cannot say anything good then don't talk bad
[17:00] she has apologized to mom not me
[17:03] she is elder than you, Maheer!
[17:06] being elder doesn't mean that she shall blame me for stealing
[17:10] tomorrow she will say that I stole her money. In fact, mom do you remember?
[17:16] Maheer, stop it... end this matter
[17:19] there is no use of stretching the matter like a chewing gum & to ruin the peace of our house. And then she has apologized
[17:26] wow mom wow! this is great. Such a big matter ended all of a sudden
[17:32] what do you want? What do you want me to do?
[17:35] shall I make this house a battle field? then only you will get satisfied?
[17:39] tell me one thing
[17:41] why Mahnoor had blamed you only?
[17:49] I & Aima are also at home, the why she didn't blamed us?
[17:52] her room is open the entire day
[17:55] So, what are trying to say? I had stolen?
[17:59] what's with you, mom? Do you remember, the ring was found inside her room
[18:03] I am not calling you a thief, you fool!
[18:06] she has put a blame on you because of your actions
[18:13] Maheer, change yourself. I have told you thousand of times to fix yourself & focus on your studies
[18:19] until when poor Faraz will support us?
[18:22] look, you are intelligent in studies, work hard
[18:27] instead of wandering around at nights, try doing some small job to lessen your brother's burden
[18:35] So mom, why don't you ask sister-in-law to lessen brother's burden?
[18:40] I cannot do the job along with studies
[18:44] and yes! I can never do any small job!
[18:50] as if this guy will become a governor that's why he won't do any small job
[18:56] am I crazy to take money from Mahnoor & get my head bowed in front of her
[19:07] Ramsha, I have brought Mahnoor
[19:10] brother Faraz, you don't know how angry sister Areeba will be after seeing sister Mahnoor. She is already very angry
[19:17] she won't shoot me though
[19:23] why you did this?
[19:26] you have sent the police to our house without even thinking
[19:30] Ramsha, lets go inside & talk
[19:32] Brother Faraz, brother Saqlain is inside the room. And you know it very well what will happen if you guys will go inside
[19:43] is he back home? Did the police released him?
[19:48] left him? the police has beaten him so much that I can't even tell you
[19:51] and you are tensed on the fact that how come he got released
[19:57] here, our life was on the stake for an entire day
[19:59] and sister Areeba, she was crying so badly that how will we get brother Saqlain released. But thanks God... 
[20:09] and now for God sake leave from here, what if the matter gets more bad
[20:14] I am so afraid, please go away from here otherwise a new problem will arise
[20:19] Ramsha, nothing will happen. Just trust me
[20:22] Mahnoor, shall we go inside?
[20:24] Okay, but you people will go inside only on one condition
[20:29] that you will apologize to brother Saqlain & end the matter right away. Please... 
[21:05] be gentle
[21:21] that's it, its hurting
[21:42] please forgive me
[21:47] I am so ashamed
[21:52] Areeba
[21:55] you... 
[21:57] why are you apologizing? You have done nothing
[22:02] whatever is happening with you today... 
[22:06] its because of my sister
[22:20] do you know, today... 
[22:24] somebody had raised his hand on me for the first time
[22:31] and what allegation they have put on me
[22:43] how shall I make you believe, that I am innocent?
[22:48] I haven't done anything
[22:51] I believe you
[22:54] I know you are innocent, you can never do any such thing
[23:02] I believe you!
[23:09] what will happen next, I don't understand anything
[23:16] the case will proceed in the court, and I've to attend the court hearings
[23:24] shall I look after my work, this house & related rents, Ramsha & you or.. 
[23:33] shall I visit the court?
[23:42] be careful... 
[23:55] I don't understand anything that what shall I do
[24:03] I've been trapped so badly
[24:08] I don't understand anything
[24:16] sister... 
[24:18] do remember one thing, that you are here to solve the issue not to fight more. Ok?
[24:30] I don't understand anything, Areeba
[24:35] I'm caught
[24:41] there is no need for you to go to the court
[24:47] what are you doing here?
[24:53] sister Areeba, I came to talk
[24:57] I don't want to see her face even
[25:00] Faraz, immediately take her away from here otherwise don't complain me later
[25:07] but sister, please listen to us
[25:09] what shall I listen to? yes?
[25:17] can you see the wounds on his face?
[25:21] its because of you!
[25:25] you should die of shame!
[25:36] you did such a disgusting act that I am unable to face my husband!
[25:41] sister Areeba, I... 
don't take my name!
[25:45] I don't have any relation with you
[25:54] Faraz, take her away. End of discussion. Go away from here
[25:59] Areeba, one minute
[26:01] one minute...
[26:06] Mahnoor, you think that I have murdered aunt, right? I gave her poison
[26:15] because I had brought those medicines for her
[26:26] tell me one thing, if someone else would have brought those medicines besides me
[26:33] if Faraz would have brought them, then... 
[26:36] had you filed a case against Faraz too?
[26:51] you... 
[26:57] do you have any proof to justify this blame?
[27:02] no, right?
[27:08] even a stupid person has got this much brains, that he doesn't pronounce anyone a killer without even seeing
[27:13] and she... 
[27:18] she had made me my mother's killer
[27:20] brother Saqlain
[27:23] I am sorry
[27:25] I made a mistake
[27:36] mom's sudden death had taken away my sense of thinking
[27:42] I hadn't thought that one day mom will leave us all of a sudden
[27:47] when I got to know about the poison, I felt as if my brain has stopped working
[27:54] aunt's death is quite a big shock for me
[27:59] she was my mother
[28:06] I am feeling as if... 
[28:10] once again, somebody has taken away my mother from me 
[28:21] if you had to do the case, then you should have done it on that pharmaceutical company
[28:26] or those who had sold the medicines
[28:32] its my mistake
[28:36] its my mistake that I took over all of you guys responsibilities on my head
[28:46] I kept on doing everything for you guys crazily
[28:54] if I hadn't brought the medicines then today
[28:59] I wouldn't have been blamed
[29:06] you did this deliberately, right?
[29:10] you did conspiracy against me to trap me
[29:15] No, there isn't any fault of Faraz in this
[29:18] he has been explaining me since beginning. In fact, its is him who had brought me here today
[29:25] whatever happened was my mistake
[29:29] don't blame Faraz for my mistake
[29:36] I cannot believe it that you went to the police station alone
[29:40] so you think that I had provoked Mahnoor?
[29:43] the complain Mahnoor did against you at the police station, is because of me?
[29:50] you are having a misunderstanding
[29:52] yes I was concerned about it
[29:55] but, I don't believe that anyone will add poison in the medicines deliberately
[30:01] yes, medicines can be fake or contaminated. I was explaining this to Mahnoor again & again
[30:07] but if you still think that you got insulted because of me
[30:16] then I apologize to you
[30:19] you are our elder, brother Saqlain
[30:22] and elders grateful nature should be big too
[30:27] we have accepted our mistake, please forgive us being our elder
[30:38] Okay
[30:43] fine... 
[31:11] what happen, what are you thinking?
[31:16] I don't understand anything, what shall I do?
[31:20] what you don't understand now?
[31:22] that what will we do next
[31:24] do whatever you feel like doing
[31:28] look, the house documents are in your name
[31:32] lets sell it, also 50 lacs is inside the bank
[31:36] lets go somewhere
[31:39] how will I take divorce? 
And I cannot marry Rameez without divorce
[31:45] yes, true that
[31:48] listen to me, all these matters can be seen later
[31:52] mom, first of all tell me how shall I get rid of this fake pregnancy matter?
[31:58] we cannot make him a fool anymore
[32:01] he is asking me to go to the doctor along with him
[32:11] why are you quiet now? Tell me something
[32:14] what's the big deal in this?
[32:16] tell Saqlain someday that you had slipped & the baby is no more
[32:25] how's that? This is called, "killing 2 birds with one stone"
[32:31] eat this, Saqlain had brought this for you
[33:29] you did such a disgusting act, that I am unable to face my husband!
[33:35] I don't have any relation with you!
[34:06] Areeba, I've forgiven Mahnoor because of you
[34:11] I know
[34:13] and I never wanted another allegation on me, that the sisters fought because of me
[34:22] otherwise, this matter wouldn't have got over so easily
[34:25] I know that too
[34:28] this is your paramountcy
[34:31] Faraz was taunting me about my great nature
[34:35] my nature is quite great & I've got to know his status
[34:40] he had attacked me after hiding behind his wife
[34:44] No, Faraz was explaining Mahnoor
[34:47] he was talking non-sense
[34:52] he took revenge from me
[34:55] do you remember, I had got him locked inside the police station because of Mahnoor
[35:01] he did the same drama with me, he sent Mahnoor to the police station against me
[35:07] I became quite as we are relatives
[35:11] otherwise, I know it very well how to keep such people in their limits
[35:59] brother Saqlain
[36:02] yes tell me, what is the matter?
[36:06] actually I want some money
[36:11] yes, why not
[36:17] take this
[36:24] but this...
[36:25] what happen, is this less?
[36:28] yes
[36:31] Ok, keep 500 more. Take it
[36:35] Ok I am leaving now as I am getting late
[36:47] the breakfast is here, at least have breakfast before leaving
[36:49] No, I will do the breakfast with my friend. He has a flight, so I am going to pick him
[36:53] which friend?
[36:54] I have a friend, he helps me a lot in my business. Bye!
[36:59] bye!
[37:06] look at this
[37:08] I have to go to the university, & I need money
[37:14] he has given some to you
[37:16] this? this 1000 rupees?
[37:20] if you require more then you could have asked. He would have given them to you
[37:25] sister, earlier brother Saqlain used to give the shop rents & house rents to mom
[37:30] and then mom used to give me a lot of pocket money
[37:34] I don't keep any money, as he takes care of all the expenses
[37:38] and I don't know anything about the rents
[37:43] Fine, I will ask him
[37:46] to give you the entire month's pocket money together
[37:50] do tell him
[37:52] I don't like asking money from him on daily basis
[37:56] I will
[38:15] she is remembering all the calculation so early in the morning
[38:19] house expense & shop rents
[38:23] I will give the calculation of each & every penny
