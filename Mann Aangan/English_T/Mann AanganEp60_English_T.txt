[01:14] She cried because of me. I trapped her and deceived her with my love. She's here because of me.
[01:23] She was also upset because she couldn't get her true love.
[01:30] Because she was sincere with you but you were flirting with her.
[01:37] I wanted to go and tell her everything truthfully. I wanted to tell her that whatever I did I was doing to get back at Mahnoor for my insult.
[01:51] But what could I do? I don't have the strength to bear her hatred.
[02:01] To tell you the truth, ever since I heard Ramsha married to save you from punishment, I have started to respect her more.
[02:11] And I feel insulted in my own eyes.
Should I tell you something? Will you listen to me? Don't contact Ramsha now.
[02:21] He's right and as it is, she's in a lot of pain because of you. The university is still talking about her and she is in pain herself.
[02:31] What if you destroy her married life?
See whoever that man is. Whether is he older than her or anything, he is her husband.
[02:42] If he finds out about the two of you. Think about it. He'll make her life hell.
[02:51] That's why please. Don't contact her again. Try and understand.
He's right.
[03:32] Did you talk to Ramsha?
No. First I called and nobody answered and now her phone is off, all of a sudden.
[03:45] Yes. 
I was thinking to go meet her. She is so scared of Touqeer and ever since Areeba told me things, I've been so worried.
[04:02] Faraz?
Yes mom?
[04:05] Dear did you say something to Yasir?
No I didn't even talk to him. Why? What happened?
[04:16] Nothing happened. He just looked a little off and he said that he met you in the office and you insulted him.
[04:28] I didn't insult him. Yes I told him to work hard and make a name for himself. If he has an issue, I'll talk to him.
No.
[04:42] Don't inquire and raise matters. Both of you work together, I just don't want anything to happen.
[04:51] Its about your sister. Mahnoor you two.
Yes. Don't worry. I'll handle.
[04:59] Yes. You're sensible and you know. You'll handle it.
Yes.
[05:06] Alright.
[05:12] This boy has a very cheap mentality.
What happened?
[05:19] What would happen? If he continues to do what he does, we'll have to take a decision.
[06:11] Areeba, you haven't eaten anything since morning. Mahnoor told me and even Saqlain said that I should care for your diet.
Don't worry about me.
[06:25] I will not die so easily.
God forbid why are you talking like this. May God bless you with a long life.
[06:38] Don't curse me with a long life.
[06:46] You have no idea what I'm going through, Salman.
I know what Saqlain did but you have to be strong. 
[06:57] You have to take care of yourself for your child. A mother has a big responsibility for her children.
[07:07] You will not say no now. I'll finish dusting and bring you lunch.
[07:18] And I kept Saqlain sir's file here because you said so. Please look at it.
[10:44] Areeba?
[10:56] Why are you here? Who do you have here now?
[11:08] You're here.
I have no relationship with you.
[11:15] How do you say that? You're my wife.
Because you have decided to divorce me.
[11:31] And I've seen those papers. If you have decided you want to divorce me. Why haven't you done still?
[11:49] You're mistaken. Those papers...
I've been mistaken about you since years. I have now seen your real face.
[12:15] Areeba.. see..
Don't touch me and don't even take my name from your mouth.
[12:31] Go to her. The one for whom you have decided to leave me for.
[12:40] Get out from here.
Areeba listen to me.
[12:43] Saqlain, get out from here. Go away.
Listen...
[12:48] What are you doing?
Go away.
[12:51] Have you lost your mind? Whats wrong with you? I'm only holding back because of my child.
Its not your child.
[12:59] This is my child. Mine. I will never let the shadow of a liar like you, fall on him.
You've lost your mind.
[13:12] Will you take away my child from me?
Yes.
[13:19] I will not let you see its face ever in your life. After what you did with me and my family..
[13:31] you have no relation with me or my child. Go away. Get lost from here. Get lost.
[13:57] Get lost. This is my mother's house.
[14:13] Go away..
[14:41] This is not your house.
[14:46] Its my house. Its my house.
[14:59] You're angry. If I don't come for two three days, you'll settle down. I'll not come.
[15:16] This is my house.
[16:30] How long will you keep blaming others to hide your sin? Yes I've found it. You took it from the thieves and hid it in the cupboard.
[16:42] Mahnoor was right about you and I thought she was lying only so that I could save my house.
[16:53] You killed my mother. She thought of you as her son and yet you did this with her.. 
Areeba..
[17:06] This is my child. Mine. I will not let the shadow of a liar like you fall on him. I'll not let you see its face for all my life. 
[18:01] Yes please send him in. I'm waiting.
[18:10] Come in, please.
[18:15] Hello. Miss Mahnoor. How are you?
I'm good. Please sit.
[18:23] I was waiting for you. I've heard you're very punctual.
Yes I did come on time but I met Mr. Touqeer Durrani.
[18:33] Touqeer?
Do you know him?
[18:37] Yes he is my brother in law.
[18:39] Oh really? I didn't know you were Naeema's younger sister.
Naeema?
[18:47] Who is Naeema?
Touqeer's wife. Naeema Touqeer. Aren't you her younger sister?
[18:53] No. I'm..
I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about Touqeer Ahmed and that you knew him.
[19:02] Actually he's a very big businessman and he has a big business. He belongs to Islamabad and he was my neighbor when we lived there.
[19:13] Thats why we have family terms and we know him. He also has two children.
[19:22] Anyways, lets get back to work. We'll discuss what we need to.
[19:29] Yes, the consignment that you sent. Please check the quotation and tell me.
Sure.
[20:15] Sorry. Alright, no problem. You can check it.
Yes. Sure.
[20:23] Okay. Thank you. Will you have tea or coffee?
No thanks.
[20:29] I'll ask my colleague and he'll handle the rest of the details.
Sure.
[20:36] Nice meeting you.
[20:43] Yes please give Mr. Amjad all the details about the consignment.
[21:46] My name is Mahnoor. I'm Ramsha's sister and I want to meet her.
Yes I know.
[21:58] Sir, mam's sister. Yes, the same. Okay sir.
[22:08] Madam isn't at home right now.
What do you mean?
[22:11] She went out with sir a while ago.
[22:16] I talked to her. She's home. If she wasn't home, who did you call and get the instructions from?
[22:23] Mam..
Let me go inside. Its very important.
[22:26] Mam, I'm not allowed you to let you inside. Sir has instructed us not to let any guest inside when he isn't home.
But..
[22:34] Its important for me to meet her.
Mam I'm an employee. I have to do what my boss instructs me. The house's security is my responsibility so please..
[22:46] Please leave.
Please listen to me. Let me meet her once. Just once..
[23:23] Yes Ramsha?
I'll die here of fear. I feel suffocated in this house. Please take me away from here.
[23:34] Please.
What happened? Is everything alright?
[23:38] Touqeer has captured me here. He doesn't let me go outside and doesn't let me meet inside. The way he's treating me, I cannot tell you. Please help me.
[23:50] I was outside just now but the guard didn't let me meet you. Touqeer has instructed him not to let me meet you.
[23:58] Don't worry. I'll not let you live in this hell. I'll take you away, no matter what. Just take care.
[24:08] Okay..
[24:40] Are you going somewhere?
Yes, I have some work. I'll be back.
[24:45] This means you'll be living here with me. 
Yes.
[24:51] This is great. I always wanted you to live here with me. But Areeba? Will she live there?
[24:59] I mean, she fought with you and threw you out. But that house is yours. 
That house is mine and it will stay mine. Let her be there for a while so that her mind settles down.
[25:10] I can set her straight myself but..
But I feel she'll never straighten out ever now.
[25:17] And why is that?
Because she is expecting your child now. You'll pamper her and do everything she says and perhaps..
[25:25] she will only forgive you only if you leave me. And you would do that for your child.
Its impossible. I do want a child but I love you too.
[25:39] And don't worry about me leaving you. I have to leave her and I would have but..
[25:50] But you could do it..
I could do that as well. Its not a big deal for me.
[25:56] And that child?
I'll take it away from her and the house as well. She'll suffer then.
[26:03] She raised her voice with me. I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget.
[26:13] And this.. why is that wretched woman calling me again and again?
Who is it? Areeba?
[26:19] No Mahnoor. Areeba must have told her everything and now she wants to meet me but I don't want to talk to her.
[26:29] Oh well. Don't worry. Nobody can separate us. I'll come.
[26:44] Of course I do worry about you. I'll be here for a few days more only. What will you do then?
[26:51] Then you'll neither have this house nor your money.
[27:45] How did you like it?
Its very good. Beautiful. By the way,
[27:52] why is that for?
Just like that. I liked it and bought it for you. If you want you can think of it as a wedding anniversary present.
[28:10] Areeba? Areeba?
[28:17] Do you know Touqeer? He is already married. He has a wife and two children. He has his whole family in Islamabad.
[28:27] Saqlain has deceived us.
What? Mahnoor do you know what you're saying?
[28:35] I know what I'm saying. Look at these pictures if you don't believe me.
[28:54] Look at this.
[29:02] Touqeer deceived us big time. 
Yes.
[31:21] Where are you? Come home immediately.
[32:06] Here I am. I knew you'd not be able live a day without me. You get worried.
[32:27] If Touqeer was already married, why did you get Ramsha married to him?!
[32:38] He has two children and you got my younger sister married to him.
I don't know about that.
[32:48] You didn't? How didn't you know? You have been friends with that cheap man for years. You praised him so much and said he'd keep Ramsha very happy.
[33:04] Is this how he's keeping him happy? He has imprisoned her in his house and doesn't let me meet her.
Why do you both blame me for everything?
[33:15] Areeba you know I was against you. You forced me to get your sister married to him when you knew what your sister had done.
[33:29] When did I ever decide anything myself? You planned everything and manipulated me to do your things.
[33:43] You did everything through me.
[33:52] All those decisions were yours and I did those.
Areeba, this isn't the time for all this.
[34:02] Tell him to come with me to Touqeer's house with me to get Ramsha out of his trap. 
Have you lost your mind?
[34:11] You'll not do anything. I'll do something.
There's no need to talk. I'll not leave Ramsha with that fraud even for a second. I'll not tolerate anything.
[34:21] Areeba, make her understand.
[34:27] Mahnoor, take the police along and get Ramsha out.
Have you two lost your mind?
[34:37] Don't ever think about doing something like this? He's very influential.
We're facing a cheap man like you. We'll face him as well.
[34:52] But Ramsha will not be left on your mercy.
Alright. Get her divorced and put another stain on her name.
[35:06] As it is, you don't care for respect or disrespect. She ran away because of you earlier and now you'll destroy her house. Go.
[35:30] Nothing suits you at all. Its all because of you and you're taunting?
[35:40] First you dug up a hole for Mahnoor and then you did the same with Ramsha..
Areeba..
[35:55] Will you talk to me like this only because Mahnoor told you to?
You can leave. I feel nauseated looking at you.
[36:11] You make me sick. I get sick at myself.
You're testing my patience.
[36:18] You're testing my patience.
[36:26] Leave. I might do something with you and myself. Don't ever show me your face in my life again. Please.
[37:05] Go away.
[37:52] Areeba you knew I was against this. You forced me to get her married to him when you knew how your sister was.
[38:21] Hello.
Hello. Where is mom?
[38:26] Mom went to Yasir's house.
Why did she go to Yasir's house?
[38:32] I don't know she might have to discuss something about his job.
But he hasn't joined the office yet.
[38:51] You're tired, should I get you water?
No I'm fine. Thank you.
[38:57] I understand. Take care. Faraz, come with me.
But where do we have to go? Why are you so worried?
[39:04] We have to go to Touqeer's house to get Ramsha?
What happened to Ramsha?
[39:08] Do you know Saqlain lied to us to get Ramsha married to Touqeer and he did a partnership with him in return?
What?
[39:17] Yes. Touqeer has a wife and two kids and they live in Islamabad. He didn't even tell us about anything.
And how did you find out?
[39:37] I felt that Touqeer wasn't right for Ramsha there and then. That Saqlain supported him and made everything difficult. We should have stopped them there.
[39:48] I cannot leave Ramsha there Faraz.
Ramsha shouldn't even live with that man.
[39:53] But what can I do? He doesn't let me meet Ramsha. Ramsha was worried and I'm getting anxious thinking what he might do to her.
[40:02] Don't worry. I'll come with you. Lets go.
Come on.
