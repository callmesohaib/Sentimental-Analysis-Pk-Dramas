[01:15] Here is your money and from now on Ramsha won't be going to college.
[01:23] Our exams are about to start, why is she leaving?
She has ran off with that boy Mahir, we don't know where she is.
[01:35] Mr. Saqlain...
Greetings.
[01:39] Greetings to you too. I just heard you saying that Ramsha has run away.
[01:45] Yes...
Where did she go? And with whom did she run away?
[01:51] Have some shame... you go to the mosque regularly and pray five times a day... you have daughters as well.
[01:57] If you respect our daughters, then your daughters will be respected as well.
In our family, we do not have daughters that run away.
[02:15] Mahir, where are you? We've been contacting you since yesterday, but you aren't talking to us.
[02:21] Do you know that your family is looking for you as well?
Did they try and contact you?
[02:27] Brother Faraz and sister visited me. They went to all of your friends.
[02:32] They were very worried. What is the problem and where are you right now?
[02:37] I'll tell you everything...
[02:40] but listen to me carefully. If brother Faraz or anyone else from my family tries to contact you...
[02:46] don't tell them anything.
What's the matter, Mahir?
[02:51] Ramsha and I are together.
[02:55] What?
Yes... today we are going to get married.
[03:00] Mahir, have you gone insane? Since when have you gotten so serious about Ramsha?
[03:05] You were just passing the time with her, right? Then what is this?
I wanted her...
[03:12] and I will do anything to have her.
[03:20] He's gotten foolish and emotional. He used to be an intelligent guy.
[05:43] Mahir...
Yes?
[05:50] I think we shouldn't have done this. I feel anxious...
Are you in your senses?
[05:59] You should have thought of that when you were leaving home.
There wasn't time when we were leaving home.
[06:05] We didn't have time.
[06:07] Alright... you want to go back, then go. You can then marry whoever they want you to marry.
[06:13] It's nothing like that, why are you being angry at me?
Come on, you wasted my time!
[06:20] Look... don't be angry, you know how much I love you.
I love you as well, that's why I took such a huge step.
[06:31] We've done what we've done. We have to own this.
[06:37] Once we get married, we'll go to our homes, and then no one will say anything to us.
[06:49] Ramsha listen to me carefully. We have to get married today. Yes, today.
[06:58] I'm going to get the cleric. Do you trust me or not?
[07:06] Alright then, I'll be right back.
[07:33] No, please don't think that. It's nothing like that.
[07:37] I'll talk to brother Saqlain.
[07:43] Sure, I'll call you back.
[07:52] What does brother Saqlain want? Why is he doing all of this?
[07:57] What did he do?
Auntie just called, she said that the police just took Faraz.
[08:05] The complaint was against Faraz, then why is brother Saqlain involving Faraz in all this?
[08:11] He makes mountains out of molehills. He created a huge commotion outside the house as well.
[08:18] He always thinks the best for everyone. Have you not seen how worried he is?
All of us are worried.
[08:27] Auntie is worried, Faraz is worried and they are ashamed as well. They have never helped Mahir, they have always tried to make him understand.
[08:37] But that doesn't mean that we start blaming Faraz's family.
[08:53] Hello Faraz, where are you? Why did the police take you?
[09:03] I'll wait for your call.
[09:06] Farewell.
[09:30] Thank you Mr. Faraz for cooperating with us.
[09:34] We didn't know that you are family with them.
[09:40] This was my duty and I was worried because of Mahir as well.
[09:45] I've been searching for him since last night and I am still trying to find him. Ramsha is like my sister...
[09:52] There is no justifying the foolish thing that Mahir has done.
[09:56] If he's in the city we'll find them. We'll also contact his friends through the numbers that you gave us.
[10:05] I talk to everybody last night. Mahir didn't contact any one of them.
[10:11] You never know, may he'll contact one of them today.
Yes.
[10:15] I'll get going.
Yes, you can go.
[10:37] Greetings sir... they have been here since last night. Mahir just went out a while ago.
[10:46] This bungalow belongs to a rich man, he isn't here right now. His daughter lives here.
[10:52] How do you know that?
I've been here since last night and learned this from the security guard.
[11:02] Alright... call the police and ask them to come here.
Okay, boss.
[11:55] The police will be here in five minutes.
Until then we'll wait here.
[12:54] You are very lucky.
[13:01] Do you know that before you Mahir was dating me?
[13:06] But I don't know what he saw in you...
[13:17] Aqsa...
[13:22] I...
Come inside, sit right there.
[13:28] The guests will be here shortly and then we'll start.
[13:36] Thank you so much. You've done so much for us.
[13:44] It's okay. No problem.
[13:48] All the preparations have been made, right?
[13:56] Yes.
[14:00] Thank you so much.
Grab hold of him.
[14:09] What are you doing?
[14:12] What are you doing in my home?
[14:15] We'll tell you right now. Mr. Saqlain come inside, and we arrested them both.
[14:50] Mr. Saqlain you can take your sister-in-law home. I don't want her going to the police station.
[14:57] But you come with us. I have to sort you out.
[15:03] You like to run off with girls, right? Take him away!
Listen to me...
[16:00] Put him inside!
I did nothing, I'm innocent. She came with me!
[16:06] Open the cell and put him inside!
[16:09] Why don't you listen to me? I did nothing. She chose to come with me.
Enough of your nonsense! This won't work in front of me!
[16:16] Otherwise, I'll break your face.
Listen to me!
[16:48] Get out of the car! Get out!
[16:57] Give me this bag...
[17:20] Lord knows what she must have done by now.
Sister Areeba...
[17:24] Don't think things like that.
[17:27] Let go of my hand. You're hurting me!
Areeba, control your sister!
[17:33] I've brought her back!
[17:37] Where were you?
She was with Mahir!
[17:41] She spent the entire night with him.
Brother Saqlain!
[17:44] What?
[17:46] Thank God that the police stopped them, otherwise, they were about to get married!
[17:52] Because of this, I've been defamed for the rest of my life.
[17:56] She has humiliated me in front of the entire world.
[18:02] Why didn't you die? What were you thinking when you ran away?
[18:22] All of this is happening because of you. I loved him and was about to marry him, there's nothing wrong with that!
[18:27] Shut up your nonsense!
[18:30] What you did was wrong! Both families have been humiliated by this. Have you any idea?
[18:39] We spent the entire night in worry.
[18:45] I will be the one to sort you out. Last time I locked you in a room...
[18:51] but now I will tie you and lock you up. Come with me!
[19:40] What were trying to do? 
[19:56] I'll make her understand.
[20:00] Please go.
[20:02] She won't come out of the room!
[20:22] What did you do? What did you do?
[21:10] What is the point of doing all this? We can't change what happened.
[21:15] We have been humiliated as much as it was possible. Step out in the neighborhood after a while...
[21:20] see what they have to say for your sister.
[21:24] Areeba, if suicide wasn't a sin...
[21:28] I would have done it by now.
[21:32] Don't say that.
Leave me. Stop crying in front of me.
[21:43] I regret the day we got married.
[21:52] No man has been humiliated more than me, at the hands of your sisters.
[22:04] They left no stone unturned in trying to humiliate me.
[22:09] Sometimes they made me go to the police.
[22:13] And sometimes she has me locked up in the police station.
Brother Saqlain.
[22:17] What?
[22:19] Don't think that Ramsha is the only one to blame in this.
[22:23] You are equally to blame for this.
[22:32] You're the one who hid everything from us, right? If you had told us on time, this wouldn't have happened.
[22:42] She has disgraced us.
[22:47] Who will marry this sister of yours?
[22:52] Is there anyone?
[22:59] Is there anyone who'll marry her?
[23:48] Yes, inspector?
[23:50] Yes... thank you very much for recovering my sister. You helped save our respect.
[24:00] I will never forget this favor for the rest of my life. Yes, we checked her stuff, but there's nothing there but clothes.
[24:08] I'm sure that man stole all the jewelry.
[24:13] It was a lot of jewelry. Please recover it for us.
[24:18] Of course. Whenever you visit us, I'll be here.
[24:24] Thank you once again.
[25:00] Inspector... you can't keep me here for long. I've done nothing wrong.
[25:07] That will be proven, you can't leave this place so easily.
[25:11] Maulabaksh set him straight, and ask him where the jewelry is.
[25:17] What jewelry, I don't have anything like that. Ramsha had everything and she still has.
[25:23] His brother-in-law said that she has no money or jewelry. The girl said that she gave everything to you.
[25:31] She's lying.
[25:33] Believe me, I have nothing.
Maulabaksh shut him up. He's been speaking since morning.
[25:42] Listen to me...
Shut up!
[26:34] We shouldn't have done this. I think we've done something wrong. I feel anxious.
[26:39] You should have thought of that when we were leaving home.
We didn't have time when we were leaving home.
[27:03] Sister Areeba I think that brother Saqlain is overreacting.
[27:09] Look at where he's taking things. He's completely right.
[27:18] You and Ramsha have always humiliated him. I can count on my fingers the things you've done. And now Ramsha...
[27:28] Anyways... you still aren't correcting your ways.
[27:32] Really... what did I do that you're taunting me?
Enough, don't make me open my mouth.
[27:44] I've spent the entire night in anxiety by Ramsha. Saqlain told me off, and what did you lose?
[27:54] I always have to be embarrassed in front of my husband.
[28:02] Mahnoor...
[28:09] What happened? Did they find out anything about Ramsha and Mahir?
[28:14] Yes, we've found Ramsha.
Really?
[28:20] I'm surprised. I had been looking for them everywhere, why didn't anyone inform me?
[28:28] She's just came back. She's in her room.
[28:33] And where is Mahir?
[28:37] He's in the police station and I'll ask Saqlain to ask the police to not let him go.
[28:43] Because of him, we've been humiliated. He provoked our sister...
[28:52] And for this, he should be punished!
[29:00] Sister Areeba...
When a girl disappears the entire night and comes back home...
[29:06] you have no idea what the world tells them.
[29:15] All of this happened because of your brother. He did what he did and now we have to face the consequences.
[29:26] My sister's life has been ruined.
[30:06] Faraz, where were you? I've been so scared here.
[30:12] Did you find out anything about Mahir and your sister, Mahnoor?
[30:18] They've found Ramsha.
[30:21] Thank God, is everything alright? Did they two marry each other...
[30:30] Where is Mahir? Did he not come home?
[30:36] He's in the police station.
[30:38] What?
[30:49] Why have they kept him in the police station, if they've found her sister?
He has a report filed against him.
[30:57] We have to bail him out.
Then go! why are you here? Free your brother!
[31:06] When your sister is home? Why have they arrested Mahir?
[31:11] Faraz, go there.
I will bail him out, but not now.
[31:21] Why?
He should be punished for what he did.
[31:26] Her sister should be punished as well. She was equally involved with this.
[31:30] She's not a child, she left home in her senses.
[31:39] Auntie, she's being punished. She's being called with all sorts of different names.
[31:47] She's being defamed in the neighborhood and there is a complaint against her in the police station.
[31:57] When Mahir returns home you'll love him like you used to...
[32:04] but have you thought about her? She can't move on in life, she can't go outside, or carry on with her education.
[32:11] Because if she goes outside, then people will talk about her.
[33:43] Is everything alright? You look very tired today.
[33:48] Hmm...
Did you not sleep at night?
[33:53] I am tired and I didn't sleep as well.
[33:59] Why? What happened? You didn't call me yesterday as well, is everything alright?
[34:11] You know Ramsha, Areeba's sister.
[34:15] She ran away from home last night.
[34:21] We looked for her the entire night.
[34:25] She ran away, or did you make her run away?
[34:32] Think about what you want.
I do understand.
[34:38] I've started feeling scared of you. You've started knowing me more than I know myself.
[34:45] No... I still feel afraid of you.
[34:53] Why didn't you make her run away? And if you did then why are you looking for her?
[34:59] Because I have to get her married.
[35:05] What fool would marry a girl who ran away from home?
[35:12] You're right.
[35:16] Only an idiot would marry her.
[35:22] Anyways...
[35:26] I'm tired and I want to sleep.
[35:30] If you wanted to sleep, then you could have done it at home. Why did you come here?
[35:35] I wanted to leave Areeba alone.
[35:40] I want her to be alone in her pain and her tensions.
[35:52] I have to give her time to shed her tears.
[35:57] To Areeba?
[36:01] We'll talk later. I'm very tired and I want to sleep.
[36:06] Please close the door.
[36:53] Mahnoor...
[36:57] Why are men so careless?
[37:03] Why don't they think before they do and say something...
[37:07] that his single mistake can become torture for women and close all paths for them.
[37:19] I explained things to Mahir, and I asked him to stay away from Ramsha.
[37:26] But he took no mercy on Ramsha.
[37:31] Brother Saqlain sometimes tell me off and sometimes he does it sister Areeba. He only targets Ramsha.
[37:43] Like he's the only one with respect.
[37:46] And we are the women who carry his respect.
[37:51] No one is there to question him, no matter what he does.
[37:56] But he tells us off over everything.
[38:02] From the beginning, he has blackmailed sister Areeba.
[38:07] But sister Areeba doesn't understand that this is brother Saqlain's way.
[38:14] To degrade us.
[38:34] What happened?
He's asleep. He'll stay here for the entire day now.
[38:40] Why are you acting crazy? This is his home and he'll come here anytime he wants.
[38:46] This is my home.
[38:47] And not anyone can come here. This is not a guest house.
[38:53] Show this anger to Saqlain and then he'll teach you a lesson.
[38:59] What's with you Fariya? Cool yourself down, you don't have the baby excuse anymore.
[39:08] which you used to straighten Saqlain. I don't want this to fall on your head.
What will he do?
[39:16] Will he divorce me? Let him... I'm counting the day till that happens.
[39:22] Are you insane?
[39:50] Areeba... if suicide wasn't a sin, I would have done it by now.
[39:58] Don't say that.
Leave me... stop crying in front of me.
[40:05] I regret the day I married you.
[40:13] No man has been more humiliated than me at the hands of your sisters.
[40:19] They left no stone unturned. Sometimes I have to go to the police station and sometimes she has me locked up in one.
