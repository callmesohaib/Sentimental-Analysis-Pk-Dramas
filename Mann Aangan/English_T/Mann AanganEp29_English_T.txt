[01:22] aunty, they are offering the price of 60 to 70 lacs approximately
[01:28] I will try to get more money but.. 
[01:31] honestly speaking, the real value of this property is the land. Rest is just a waste
[01:44] Mahnoor what do you say about it?
[01:46] I haven't finalized the deal as of yet. I wanted to discuss all these matters with you so that
[01:51] we could make some decision mutually
[01:58] if you would have taken my suggestion, then I was not interested in selling this property
[02:10] but anyways, now you & mom have already decided
[02:14] what can I say?
[02:18] Mahnoor, what do we have to do by keeping the house?
[02:21] for now, the most important thing for us is our mother's life
[02:25] this is our heirloom property, sister
[02:27] no problem, you can still get the money. You can make a property once again
[02:32] Besides, only 10 to 12 lacs are required for your mother's operation
[02:36] I could have got mom's treatment done
[02:42] as far as this property is concerned then
[02:44] we are selling off dad's properties one after the other
[02:55] in how many places will you spend your money?
[02:58] you are already supporting your husband's family
[03:05] see, I am not saying that you shouldn't support them
[03:09] I know Faraz's financial situation very well
[03:13] there are family's expenditures
[03:16] and you should be supporting him in this
[03:18] Besides, its the duty of a good wife & daughter in law
[03:22] Faraz is a person with a very high self respect
[03:25] till date, he didn't took a single penny from me 
[03:28] in fact, he takes care of all of my expenses
[03:34] you've always been taunting me that I take care of the expense of my husband's family, right?
[03:39] then for your kind information
[03:41] I don't spend a single penny from my salary on my in-laws, nor they have ever demanded it
[03:53] I had already refused to take the dowry
[03:58] you say that they are very greedy & they just think about themselves
[04:03] so, for your kind information
[04:05] the target of every person in this world isn't his wife's money
[04:29] honestly, Faraz is such a gentleman
[04:33] he had made me realize time & again
[04:37] and whatever delusions I had in my heart for him
[04:42] all of them are cleared after Mahi's marriage
[04:45] don't know what good deed we did that we got Faraz as our son in law 
[04:52] in fact, he is also like Saqlain who had proved himself as a son but not a son in law
[05:02] aunty, if you allow me then can I finalize this deal?
[05:07] I think we shouldn't delay
[05:09] I will take an appointment for your operation as soon as we finalize this deal
[05:42] did you hear, what your mother had said?
[05:47] she is comparing me with Faraz
[05:51] its been only a few days that he became a part of our family
[05:56] she is praising her so much, just because he took her to the hospital once
[06:01] and what about me, who is serving her since so many years
[06:05] I do every of her work, to gather the rents
[06:08] to bring groceries for her
[06:11] to wait in the universities & colleges lines
[06:14] I am tiring myself to save the shops from illegal takeovers
[06:19] please don't be angry
[06:21] mom had said it just like that, but you... 
[06:26] she hadn't said just like that
[06:29] my comparison is being done with Faraz
[06:33] by saying this, she is making me realize that I haven't done anything for her in my entire life
[06:39] there isn't any such thing
[06:41] you are having a misunderstanding
[06:43] mom values you a lot, she considers you as her son
[06:48] leave it, today your mother has hurt me a lot
[06:57] tell me one thing
[07:01] is there anyone in your family like me?
[07:03] No, right?
[07:06] if I would have done this good deed with someone else, then they would have valued me way too much
[07:12] and I had never taunted you on the fact that you cannot give me an offspring
[07:19] I haven buried this wish inside my heart
[07:23] don't I feeling like expanding my family?
[07:27] that someone should carry my name forward after my demise
[07:59] hey brother! look... my new bike
[08:02] check its sound
[08:05] wow! its really very nice
[08:07] now do ride it carefully, I hope the brakes work properly
[08:10] yes brother, all of its parts are working
[08:14] ok now switch it off, the entire neighbor is getting disturbed because of its noise
[08:19] why should I switch it off?
[08:20] they should also get to know that I've brought a bike
[08:23] besides, they are usually so keen to know what is going inside our house
[08:26] today, they should enjoy my bike's sound 
[08:30] this guy will never understand anything
[08:34] anyways.... dear Faraz
[08:38] where is Mahnoor?
[08:42] will there be a late meeting in the office today as well?
[08:53] don't mind my words...
[08:56] but if Mahnoor had to stay back at office, then try to sit with her
[09:01] mom, I don't need to keep an eye on Mahnoor
[09:04] yes, but I will stay back if there would be any work
[09:08] Besides, right now Mahnoor is not at office. She has gone to her mother's house
[09:21] again she has gone to her mother's house & that too without informing me
[09:28] let her come back
[09:30] I have to fix her!
[09:37] brother
[09:37] yes
[09:39] take me somewhere please. Come on. How to sit on it?
[09:42] there is no need to! Get off, its my bike only
[09:45] only auto rickshaw suits you, so commute on it
[09:49] keep your second hand bike!
[09:51] what did you say!
[10:06] is there anyone in your family like me?
[10:08] if I would have done this good deed with someone else, then they would have valued me way too much
[10:12] and I had never taunted you on the fact that you cannot give me an offspring
[10:19] I haven buried this wish inside my heart
[10:27] don't I feeling like expanding my family?
[10:31] that someone should carry my name forward after my demise
[10:52] mom
[10:57] what is the matter, why are you sitting like this? Are you fine?
[11:01] yes, I am fine
[11:04] then what are you thinking?
[11:07] I am thinking that since I'm fine now, then what is the need for the surgery?
[11:12] I am feeling much better from the medicines prescribed by the doctor
[11:16] is it necessary to get the surgery done?
[11:19] you can get temporary relief from the medicines that the doctor has prescribed you
[11:24] God forbid, if there is some emergency in the future & then this surgery needs to be done then?
[11:29] what will we do then?
[11:30] isn't it better to get it done now? And there isn't any problem in it. Everything will be fine
[11:35] you do trust God, right?
[11:39] its my trust in God
[11:42] I have spent my entire life while trusting God
[11:45] Mahi listen, kindly take Areeba to some good doctor
[11:51] I am so worried about her, I want her to become a mother
[11:55] No, don't worry
[11:57] just pray, everything will be fine
[12:01] dear, prayers have become the daily routine of my life
[12:04] I just keep praying for the three of you, what else do I have?
[12:12] try to take care of Ramsha as well
[12:16] what Ramsha has done now?
[12:19] nowadays, she has started to spend a lot 
[12:23] she never used to do this. She has been doing it since a few weeks
[12:27] sometimes she needs gifts for her friends birthdays
[12:31] sometimes she needs money to go for a lunch with her friends
[12:35] you already know how difficult it has become for me to take care of this house expenses
[12:39] how all of this will work like this?
[12:42] she has been spending the money from both of her hands, explain her... 
[12:46] ok fine, I'll talk to her. Ok?
[12:51] please come & do some rest. You've been sitting here since so long. Come on
[13:16] come, sit here with me
[13:22] Mahi, is everything fine at your house?
[13:27] everything is fine mom, why are you thinking a lot?
[13:31] there is nothing to worry about. Everything is going very well
[13:35] don't think too much
[13:38] just rest for a while. Meanwhile let me bring soup for you. Ok?
[13:43] I'm coming in a while
[13:59] what is your problem? Why are you after one thing?
[14:03] marriage! marriage! I don't want to marry now, I want to complete my studies
[14:08] you won't straighten yourself, right?
[14:11] I had told you not to argue with me, otherwise.. 
[14:14] otherwise what? Will you beat me? Ok, go ahead
[14:17] but this time I won't listen to you at all
[14:20] you have to listen to me
[14:21] why? you don't impose your decisions on Maheer
[14:24] all orders are only for me?
[14:27] he does whatever he wants to
[14:31] please mom
[14:34] do let me do the graduation
[14:35] why were you in such a hurry that you've called the suitors family tomorrow?
[14:42] the problem is that, nowadays the way you are using your tongue like scissors
[14:48] and the way you are always stick with Mahnoor
[14:52] you are learning all of this from there, this misbehavior & rebellious acts
[14:55] otherwise, earlier you never had any issue with marriage
[14:58] yes, I didn't had any problem because at that time I didn't know anything
[15:03] but after seeing sister Mahnoor, I also feel like. .
[15:07] that I should also study & take my career seriously like.. 
[15:09] I will never let you become like her
[15:12] its her mother's courage who had tolerated her
[15:16] or maybe this kind of upbringing is done at her house
[15:22] listen to me very carefully
[15:24] I don't want to argue on this matter anymore
[15:26] I've invited the suitors family tomorrow, be presentable to them
[15:31] by God's will the matter has proceeded further, I pray that everything goes well
[15:37] you are being so stubborn & you'll make sure to fulfill it
[15:40] but remember, the consequences of that stubbornness will not be good
[15:50] greetings!
[15:52] greetings to you too!
[15:53] did you see? how she had misbehave with me
[15:58] aunty, can I say something if you don't mind?
[16:03] actually... 
[16:07] why do you want to marry Aima so soon?
[16:10] and that too forcefully
[16:14] she wants to study right now
[16:16] I think, you should give her some time
[16:19] keep your suggestions to yourself
[16:22] she is my child, I know whats good & bad for her more than you
[16:27] if Faraz has given you leniency, then it doesn't mean that you shall brain wash my daughter too
[16:33] No, I haven't said anything to Aima
[16:37] in fact, she had requested me to talk to Faraz
[16:40] even Faraz cannot confront me
[16:44] and you! you spend the entire day at your office
[16:48] don't you feel like coming back home in the evening?
[16:52] you went to your mother's house without informing me
[16:55] yes, actually I... 
enough!
[16:58] I don't want to hear any of your clarifications
[17:03] focus on your family
[17:06] if you will look back again & again then how will you focus on your family?
[17:13] neither you care about your mother in law or your husband
[17:16] you are always concerned about your mother's house
[18:54] when did you come?
[18:55] just a while ago
[18:57] how is aunty now?
[19:00] she is fine now
[19:01] have you guys decided any date for her surgery?
[19:06] yes, actually we are thinking about next week
[19:08] brother Saqlain will soon take an appointment with the doctor
[19:12] its a good thing that her surgery will be done soon
[19:16] I have a friend at the hospital. God willing, there won't be any problem
[19:20] check your work, I've completed it. So please check it
[19:27] God willing, we'll submit the entire supply plan for the next month
[19:31] God willing, you won't face any problem in the future
[19:37] thank you!
[19:39] thanks for what?
[19:42] you do you work as well as mine too
[19:46] mine & your work is not different
[20:39] mom, I got so worried when I saw Rameez coming towards me
[20:45] what if he had talked to me infront of Saqlain, then?
[20:48] don't know what would have happened
[20:51] I hope you don't have his number
[20:54] why would I have his number?
[20:57] true that
[20:59] I think this cannot be a coincidence that I saw Rameez like this
[21:03] aren't you doing any conspiracy with me?
[21:05] tell me the truth
[21:06] will I do conspiracies with you? Whatever I've done till date, its for your betterment
[21:11] and whatever will be done in the future, will be much better for you
[21:14] what do you mean?
[21:15] look, I mean no matter it must be a coincidence that you met Rameez
[21:19] but it would be much better for you if he comes back into your life
[21:24] he just came to take revenge, nothing else
[21:27] if he had to take revenge then he could have strangled me to death when he had met me
[21:32] also he would have told your reality to Saqlain
[21:35] I think there is some motive behind his return
[21:38] then what can be his other motive?
[21:41] he was crazily in love with you
[21:43] this love is so merciless
[21:46] it doesn't spare anyone so easily
[21:51] when a cunning person like Saqlain can become so crazy in your love
[21:58] then Rameez is so stupid!
[22:00] mom, tell me clearly what are you trying to say. I am already so tensed, so please don't beat about the bush
[22:05] look, one day or the other you will get rid of Saqlain
[22:09] and you still love Rameez
[22:12] since he is back now, then appease him to support you
[22:17] and make him believe that you are still innocent
[22:22] we'll leave after looting Saqlain
[22:26] and then you can get married to Rameez
[22:30] you are right. Anyways, I was so scared today
[22:34] Ok, now don't take tension. Come on
[22:38] Ok tell me, how did you find the perfume?
[22:41] yes, it was good
[22:44] I thought that you are angry with me
[22:47] No, why will I be angry at you?
[22:50] my mood is just a bit off
[22:53] you are so coward
[22:56] actually I like daring girls a lot
[23:02] but I like you
[23:05] I am not coward, its just that I try to be a little careful
[23:09] actually my family is quite conservative
[23:14] come on sweetheart, you take so much of tension
[23:21] sister, you!
[23:25] actually I was going to keep these clothes in the washing area
[23:29] if you want any kind of help then I can help you
[23:35] No, its ok
[23:37] oh sister, why are you being formal? Let me help you
[23:42] I don't need your help, thank you!
[23:44] Sure, welcome
[23:57] yes hello!
[23:59] did sister came to you?
[24:02] yes, your sister... 
[24:05] didn't she get to know that we are talking to each other?
[24:09] oh stupid! you weren't on a video call that she gets to know who is on the other side of the call
[24:24] Areeba, my dear at least I should know that why are you upset with me
[24:32] I am not angry with you, mom
[24:35] I am angry on my fate
[24:38] angry on your fate?
[24:45] Areeba
[24:47] dear, tell me what had happened
[24:50] what if you had a fight with Saqlain
[24:55] what difference does it make, mom?
[24:58] whether we fight or not?
[25:02] you don't have any value for me or for him
[25:06] what are you saying?
[25:08] do you have any idea
[25:11] how much hurt Saqlain is from your words?
[25:15] my words?
[25:19] yes
[25:22] he used to consider you as his responsibility since so many years
[25:26] he used to get tired day & night for you & for this house
[25:34] he solves each & every problem of this house
[25:37] yes
[25:38] he has fulfilled all the responsibilities since years
[25:43] what did we get in return?
[25:45] dear, we have always been grateful to him
[25:50] we gave him importance in everything, he is more valuable to me that my own children
[25:55] how much time has passed since Mahnoor has got married?
[25:57] only a few weeks?
[26:00] in such a less time you have given Saqlain's place to Faraz
[26:04] he took you to the hospital only once
[26:08] Areeba, I have never compared him with Saqlain
[26:12] he is a nice person, he also takes care of us like Saqlain
[26:17] again you are comparing with him
[26:20] what if tomorrow your other daughter is proved to be infertile
[26:23] then, will Faraz tolerate her quietly like Saqlain?
[26:27] God forbid that my Mahnoor...
[26:30] what has happened to you, why are you talking such rubbish?
[26:38] I have to live such a suffocated life at all times
[26:42] its better to die than this
[26:45] God forbid Areeba, come to me. Please don't say such things
[26:52] please don't say such things
[27:07] please come
[27:12] let me park the bike inside
[27:25] thank you!
[27:41] shall we?
[27:44] what will I tell aunty, that why I am here at this hour?
[27:50] you can make any excuse with mom
[27:54] come on, you get worried so soon
[27:57] I came home because of you, to get your assignment
[28:02] I have completed your assignment by staying awake all night long
[28:10] yes, but you could have given me the assignment tomorrow morning as well
[28:15] now here...
[28:17] yes, I could have. But you were making a lot of noise that you want your assignment right away
[28:21] now I've come home for you. Its a matter of sometime. Ok do tell mom
[28:26] that you are here to meet Aima. Meanwhile we will take the assignment & leave. Say what?
[28:32] please
[28:34] shall we go?
[28:36] come
[28:38] come!
[28:46] come in
[28:48] welcome! Let me make you meet Aima & mom today
[28:55] I can't see anyone at home
[29:00] Aima!
[29:02] mom!
[29:05] oh yes...
[29:06] I think they have gone to the market, I remember
[29:11] yes, so we should also leave then. Quickly go & bring the assignment
[29:17] why?
[29:19] are you getting scared?
[29:23] No
[29:25] No, no... you are being scared of me
[29:27] you are thinking that maybe I will being alone
[29:31] I mean, I will hurt you...
[29:36] yes?
[29:36] No, there isn't any such thing
[29:40] what if somebody saw us like this all alone at this hour, then don't know what will they think about us
[29:45] So?
[29:50] what will be the problem then?
[29:52] that your sister...
[30:02] what are you doing here?
[30:08] sister, actually I came to meet Aima
[30:13] I had forgotten her assignment at home, so we came to get it
[30:16] also Aima had asked me about her, so I thought to make her meer Aima
[30:22] but Aima & aunty are not at home
[30:31] they have gone to the market. They were discussing it in the morning, so I heard them
[30:35] few guests are coming over in the evening to see Aima
[30:39] that's why I came home early
[30:41] I didn't know all of this
[30:44] if you want you can call mom and ask her, that's why I..
come!
[30:50] let me drop you home
[30:51] No sister, but I've to go to the university. I have to submit the assignment too
[30:56] yes, let me bring your assignment
[31:37] madam, shall I serve the lunch?
[31:49] only for Areeba
[31:52] Ramsha will come in a while so I will eat with her, right now I am not hungry
[31:56] Okay
[32:00] assignment
[32:05] let me get freshen up, then I will drop you
[32:46] sister Areeba, come.. lets have lunch. I've served it
[32:54] I am not hungry
[32:58] sister, why are you getting upset? 
Madam is also crying because of you
[33:04] you know she is not well
[33:08] I am so stupid
[33:12] I had forgotten in my pain that she is not well
[33:21] you go, I am calling her
[33:24] Ok
[33:45] why did you leave university alone with Maheer?
[33:50] as I said, he has to give me an assignment
[33:52] you had to get an assignment? 
He could have it to you at home
[33:57] I had to meet Aima as well
[34:00] you wanted to meet Aima?
[34:02] are you in your senses?
[34:03] if you wanted to meet Aima, then you could have come at that time when I should have been present at home
[34:07] or maybe someone else would have been at home. How can you go anywhere without informing anyone?
[34:11] at least you should have informed mom
[34:14] I didn't know that nobody is there in the house. Infact, I was about to leave the house at that time
[34:19] as if really!
[34:21] thank God that I came
[34:22] if aunty or Faraz would have come, then don't know what they would have thought about you
[34:27] I think, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have favored you
[34:31] don't know where else do you go with Maheer after university
[34:34] I don't go anywhere. It was my first time with him
[34:37] I don't trust you anymore
[34:40] by the way, why was your assignment with Maheer?
[34:44] because he had made my assignment
[34:49] Ramsha, haven't you gone mad!
[34:52] Maheer is making your assignment as well
[34:54] then why do you go to the university? when someone else will do your part of studies
[34:58] No, I make my assignment myself
[35:01] he is just the topper of my class, so he just helped me
[35:05] and its about the time when I don't used to go to the university due to mom's ailment. He had just helped me
[35:11] I don't like to say this
[35:13] but my relation with Maheer is quite delicate, she is my brother in law
[35:16] but Ramsha please understand
[35:18] nobody in this world helps anyone without any means
[35:25] what does Maheer wants from me?
[35:27] if you aren't able to understand its meaning then
[35:31] I am sorry...
[35:34] but listen to me very carefully
[35:36] today onwards you won't meet Maheer
[35:39] and I don't like your frankness with Maheer to this extent
[35:42] Maheer is my friend before your marriage
[35:45] I know him before your marriage, right?
[35:49] he helps me a lot, and there is nothing else
[35:52] fine!
[35:54] if the matter is about studies, then you & Maheer should be related to studies only
[35:58] after university, you shouldn't have any association with Maheer
[36:02] and if you didn't listen to me
[36:05] then I will also the same that mom, sister Areeba & brother Saqlain wants
[36:20] mom
[36:24] how come madam had slept so quickly? Just now she was offering prayers
[36:31] I know you are upset with me
[36:34] I'm sorry
[36:36] I forgot in my frustration that you are not well, and what you must be going through
[36:43] mom
[36:49] mom!
[36:52] mom?
[36:54] mom, open your eyes. I'm talking to you
[36:56] mom!

[37:03] why mom isn't talking?

[37:06] bring some water.
mom, open your eyes
[37:10] mom!
[37:14] let me call Saqlain, you stay with mom
[37:17] I mean, mom is not well and you have started to spend so much. You've grown up now, when will you understand this!
[37:24] sister...
What sister?
[37:25] Saqlain! mom's condition is quite serious, she isn't opening her eyes
[37:30] what!
[37:32] please come quickly
[37:35] what happened to mom?
[37:36] mom is not opening her eyes, don't know what had happened
[37:37] what do you mean? mom!
[38:12] get ready for the ETI
[38:31] Mahnoor, nothing will happen to aunty. She will be fine
[38:36] sure? will mom be fine?
[38:48] I was afraid of this
[38:49] that's why I was asking you to take a quick decision for the surgery
[38:53] doctor, will my mother be fine? there isn't any problem, right?
[38:59] the blood supply isn't getting towards heart because of blood clotting
[39:06] it means, nothing can be done now
[39:10] No, we are trying our level best
[39:12] if you would have taken a quick decision then there wouldn't have been a massive heart attack
[39:21] anyways, we are trying. We'll see when her surgery needs to be done, as per her condition
[39:43] this old woman is such a stubborn soul
[39:46] and this doctor! at that time she was making a lot of noise
[39:49] that its impossible to save her from a heart attack
[39:52] and now, she is giving us hope that nothing will happen to her. Wow!
