[01:08] I think your car is already here. Was this the number?
[01:12] Yes. Thank you.
[01:16] You had to go through all this trouble for me.
[01:18] No mam. There's no trouble.
[01:25] Of course. You wasted so much of your time. You had to go home. Your family must have been worried.
[01:33] No I would have been more worried if I had left you like this.
[01:38] Now you get home safely. We'll meet in the office then.
[01:43] Bye.
Bye.
[02:04] Isn't this girl in a lot of hurry?
[02:06] Yes she had an affair and then a divorce and now another one.
[02:11] We should get in line for a number.
[02:22] What happened why did you get so late?
[02:25] I called mom. I had an important meeting and then my cab broke down and now..
[02:32] I've reached.
Leave everything and come here.
[02:35] What happened?
[02:36] I need to tell you something very important. Sajid called me.
[02:41] Sajid who?
[02:42] The same guy who wrote me a letter. His name is Sajid.
[02:48] Then what? What did he say? Where does he live? What does he do? What are his intentions?
[02:55] I don't know anything about his intentions.
[02:57] He called. I said hello and he said his name was Sajid. I said fine and then mom came.
[03:03] She snatched the phone from me and as soon as she took it, he hung up.
[03:07] Then?
[03:08] Then what? Mom said to note down the number and she would tell brother Saqlain.
[03:12] I requested and insisted not to tell him so she finally gave in.
[03:16] You did good. If brother Saqlain finds out he'll make a mountain out of a molehill.
[03:23] Exactly.
[03:24] Do one thing, give me that boy's number, I'll get him tracked down.
[03:28] But I doubt that boy is very sharp so he would know we'd get his number track.
[03:37] He would be calling from a public call booth or a number we cannot track.
[03:42] Yes you're right because,
[03:44] when I tried calling him back, his number was busy twice which means its a public call office.
[03:52] Mahnoor..
[03:54] Where were you? You got so late. Even Saqlain was waiting for you before he left.
[04:00] Mom I told you I had an important meeting and then the cab broke down and I got late.
[04:21] I cannot leave you here all alone. I cannot take a risk, its night time.
[04:29] Who says there aren't any good people in this world?
[04:33] If there are no good people left, this world will end.
[04:39] Poor guy. He got scolded by me and he helped me even after getting insulted.
[04:47] He was showing me attitude initially but he forgot everything when he saw I was in trouble.
[05:03] Mom?
Clean this before you keep it back.
[05:07] Hello.
[05:08] Hello. Thank God you missed your mom. Why didn't you come since so many days?
[05:17] Even you can come but you never come to my house.
[05:21] You do know I don't leave the house much.
[05:25] Ramsha is home and time flies by so fast when she's around.
[05:29] Thank God she's home to look after you.
[05:33] Otherwise Mahnoor leaves in the morning and comes home at night.
[05:39] Mom Saqlain was telling me, Mahnoor came very late yesterday.
[05:45] Mom make her understand. Why is she giving people a chance to talk.
[05:53] Its nothing. Her job demands as such.
[05:58] She doesn't usually come late. It was only yesterday.
[06:04] This is your only problem.
[06:06] You always get protective about Mahnoor.
[06:11] You think she can never do anything wrong. I'm her sister not her enemy.
[06:17] I don't like it when people point fingers at her.
I understand dear.
[06:24] Now come. Sit down. You started complaining as soon as you arrived.
[06:31] If I don't complain to you who else would I complain to?
[06:35] I will spend the entire day with you today.
[06:37] really! I will send you late because you already came after so many days.
[06:43] In fact call Saqlain and tell him that he'll have dinner with us today.
[06:50] Okay I'll tell him.
[07:09] Hmm. Fine. Its done.
[07:18] Faraz...
[07:21] I'm sorry.
[07:23] I wanted to apologize. I got angry on you without a reason.
[07:29] I was worried about something else but I vented out on you.
[07:34] I know you were upset so I,
[07:40] please forgive me if you can.
[07:42] Its okay mam.
[07:45] Actually, whenever someone does a personal attack, a person is bound to get angry.
[07:54] Getting angry is natural but we shouldn't hold back the anger but let it out.
[08:08] Then, when will you vent out on me?
What?
[08:13] Yes. You must be angry on me. Obviously,
[08:18] you were about to get promoted today. The management was considering you for this position but they hired me.
[08:25] So this means I came in the way of your promotion so you're bound to get angry on me.
[08:35] I understand that a person's fate decides his promotion, his success and the food he'll eat.
[08:42] Had this position been in my fate I would get it.
[08:46] May be you find another job and,
[08:51] you leave this position and resign. I might get this job then.
[08:58] Or may God has something even better planned for me.
[09:04] Of course.
[09:06] I am never hopeless when it comes to my blessings.
[09:14] Have a good day mam.
Thank you.
[09:23] Things have crossed all limits. This is where respectable people live.
[09:26] If things go beyond this, our daughters will be affected.
[09:30] You're absolutely right.
[09:33] Their father was very respectable but he's no more alive.
[09:37] They have one son in law and they're all making him dance to their tunes.
[09:41] There was a boy standing outside their house
[09:44] and Saqlain was literally begging him that women live in this house,
[09:49] but he never listened to him. And last night, the elder one,
[09:53] we saw with our own eyes that she came with a boy in a girl till the bus stop.
[09:59] Then she sat in a cab and left again. Tell me is this how respectable women live?
[10:03] God forgive us. They are deceiving their old mother.
[10:08] But tell us what is the solution to all this.
There is only one solution.
[10:11] All of us will go to their house and talk about what is going on.
[10:16] Wait a minute.
[10:18] Listen to me. This isn't right.
[10:22] There is no man in their house who we can talk to.
[10:26] But they have a son in law Saqlain. Call him and make him sit.
[10:30] He will make these girls understand that either they should act respectably or leave this neighborhood.
[10:37] We'll think what we need to do.
[10:39] Sister..
[10:41] I need to buy a few clothes.
[10:45] Can you take me shopping with you?
[10:49] Why do you need to go shopping all of a sudden?
[10:54] Not all of a sudden.
[10:55] I have to go to the university and I don't have even a single appropriate dress. What will I wear?
[11:01] You have nothing to wear?
[11:04] What about the clothes you got at Mahnoor's wedding?
[11:07] Whats wrong with you? They are all formal clothes.
[11:11] I cannot wear those to the university.
[11:14] I don't have anything to wear at home too. They have become so worn off.
[11:18] If I wear them to the university people would say I have nothing to wear. They'd laugh at me.
[11:23] You people don't stop asking for things.
[11:28] Do you even realize if someone can spend so much or not?
[11:34] I am not asking you for money. I'm just asking you to come along.
[11:41] I mean if sister Mahnoor was free she would have taken me shopping.
[11:48] Really? Do you have money?
[11:51] Give them to me and I'll take you shopping right away.
[11:56] No. brother Saqlain has all our money.
He doesn't have any right now.
[12:02] Saqlain doesn't have any money
[12:05] and he has already told mom that the expenditures for the past two months were so much that the money is finished now.
[12:11] You people don't have an ounce of consideration. You just keep requesting.
[12:17] Mom gave him the challan on top of it all.
[12:20] She didn't even think if he would have the money. Your fee is too much.
[12:25] Now you'll tell Mahnoor to take you shopping and bear your expenses as well.
[12:32] I will not tell Saqlain anything.
[12:34] He's already worried about the shop.
[12:40] Just pray we find a suitable solution and that our worries end.
[12:48] You go.
[12:59] Mr. Faraz?
[13:03] Congratulations. You applied for the loan. The GM has approved it.
[13:10] So fast? Thank you so much.
[13:14] You wanted an approval fast for your brother's admission.
[13:18] It would have been delayed had you not gotten the loan.
[13:22] Yes.
[13:24] By the way which university are you enrolling your brother in?
[13:27] Mam your car is here, its been waiting for long.
[13:30] I'm coming. I'll leave now. Best wishes for your brother.
[13:35] Let me know if you need anything.
Of course. Thank you.
[13:51] Whether you agree or not, everything happened as I told you it would.
Hmm..
[13:58] tell me one thing
[14:02] Now tell me. What did I tell you? These dramas about the hand burning.
[14:07] The efficiency and support he's showing, there's a reason behind it.
[14:13] He had to impress the boss.
[14:17] That's why madam Mahnoor went to the GM and approved Faraz's loan.
[14:23] She had to pay him back.
[14:25] He is very sharp. He's so quiet and always saying yes mam. Do you remember?
[14:33] He snubbed us when we were talking about mam.
[14:36] He's trying to get into mam's good books.
[14:39] If this man really respects women or if he wanted to do good, tell me one thing.
[14:47] His wife would have never left him. He insulted them so much that they,
[14:54] begged him and took their daughter away.
[14:59] Really man.
[15:01] We're unlucky that we have such bosses who don't respect us one bit.
[15:08] The poet speaks of it..
[15:09] Job is a job after all. You have to do everything when you're employed by someone.
[15:17] You're right.
Lets go.
[15:36] He's doing everything to get in mam's good books. If he really respects women,
[15:42] if he wanted to do good, then tell me one thing, would his own wife leave him like that.
[15:52] He insulted her so much that her family had to beg him to let her go.
[16:12] Did you talk to brother?
[16:14] What do I need to talk to him about?
[16:17] That I need a bike for going to the university.
[16:23] You just don't stop asking for things. You know very well.
[16:28] Faraz doesn't have so much money.
[16:31] He had to give such a big amount to those people.
[16:36] They accused him without any proof of having all her jewelry.
[16:43] So you had all the jewelry.
[16:47] Yes I did but those that we gave her as presents.
[16:50] She threw that away on my face that she didn't like it.
[16:54] She left the house herself. Should I have begged her to take everything?
[17:05] What's done is done. That wretched woman.
[17:09] She said we took her jewelry too.
[17:14] We had to pay millions and we got nothing.
[17:18] Mom whats done is done. Whats the use of crying over it?
[17:22] Move on. Leave everything. And tell me,
[17:26] do you cursing her make any difference to her? No, it doesn't.
[17:30] Yes right. My prayers or curses never work.
[17:34] She remarried as soon as everything was done.
[17:38] Wretched woman. Now nobody will give us their daughter.
[17:45] He will get married. What is wrong with you?
[17:49] You showed haste earlier and saw the consequences. Now,
[17:53] let our studies be completed. If brother gets a wife, she'll stop all our money.
[18:02] Mom?
[18:04] Brother is taking a loan for my fee, what if he takes some more?
[18:10] And who will pay it back? Will you?
[18:13] We will get less money to spend on groceries. Do you even realize how expensive everything is?
[18:19] We're already living hand to mouth.
[18:22] Now this new expense we have.
[18:26] It would have been better if you studied privately and took up a job.
[18:31] At least you could have shared some of Faraz's burden.
What?
[18:36] Mom am I not your real son? Is he your real son?
[18:39] You're talking about studying privately, its not going to get me a job. Ever.
[18:44] And then you'll taunt me that I don't have a job. Mom, I'm telling you.
[18:49] I will not go to the university on buses.
[18:53] I need a bike within 2 months and that's it.
[19:04] This boy is driving me crazy.
[19:09] How can I ask Faraz to get him a bike?
[19:13] Poor guy is already burdened with so much.
[19:28] She's very beautiful.
Really both sisters are really beautiful.
[19:34] The little one is no less either.
[19:35] What nonsense is this? What is your problem?
[19:40] What is your problem? What are you saying?
[19:42] Don't you have any shame teasing girls in your neighborhood?
[19:46] We are not the ones worried but your sister is.
[19:49] She called her lover home.
Shut up.
[19:54] If you say another word, I'll pull your tongue out.
[19:57] How many tongues are you going to pull out?
[19:59] The entire neighborhood says this.
[20:01] Also the boy who drops you till the bus stop, why don't you ask him to drop you home?
[20:06] by the way, I do have a bike too. Should I pick you up from the bus stop?
[20:11] Shut up.
[20:14] Illiterate man.
[20:18] You people have no shame.
[20:21] What happened? Whats going on?
[20:23] I was going home and they're saying nonsense.
[20:26] We only said she should ask her boyfriend to drop her home instead of the bus stop.
[20:31] I'll break your face if you say another word. What nonsense is this?
[20:36] How many mouths will you shut Mr. Saqlain.
[20:39] If you want to stop, ask your sisters in law to not cross their limits.
[20:44] This is a respectable neighborhood.
Tell me openly what you're trying to say.
[20:48] If I get more open, you'll mind it. But this is the truth.
[20:53] If we didn't consider their dead father and mother's respect, we wouldn't have let them live in this neighborhood.
[20:59] Had I not been considerate about your age, I would have answered you well.
[21:03] You might also have mothers and sisters at home and you're accusing other women.
[21:10] Don't you have any shame?
[21:11] We're not accusing anyone. Didn't you see with your own eyes?
[21:14] You just shut up.
[21:16] I know everything about you very well.
[21:19] If I tell people about you, you'll not be able to live anywhere in this city, let alone this neighborhood.
[21:24] Mahnoor, go home. I'll see to it.
[21:30] You should be ashamed.
[21:34] You just cannot tell the truth anymore.
[22:01] Mom, brother Saqlain, I'll tell you.
This is all happening because of you.
[22:07] We are getting disrespected because of you. And you..
[22:11] if there was such a big problem and that boy followed your van to our home,
[22:18] why didn't you tell mom?
[22:23] Had I known about this, I would have handled it before it reached to this point.
[22:29] People are talking the same thing that Ramsha has an affair with that boy.
[22:35] Did you see?
[22:36] You didn't even know
[22:39] but everybody in the neighborhood knows that that boy was standing outside our house.
[22:46] First we were disrespected because of Mahnoor.
[22:50] Now she is after our respect.
[22:53] sister Areeba,,
[22:55] I swear I don't know that boy. I don't know why he's following me. Its not my fault.
[23:03] Then whose fault is it?
[23:05] That boy wrote a letter for you.
[23:08] You talked to him on call and you didn't even let us know.
[23:16] Today things have reached this point..
No..
[23:21] I did tell sister Mahnoor everything.
[23:30] Come on.
[23:33] Did you see? What did Mahnoor do then?
[23:38] Did your problem solve?
[23:40] Instead we have been disrespected in the entire neighborhood once more.
[23:51] No.
[23:54] People told me that they saw Mahnoor with a boy at the bus stop.
[23:59] And that boy is her boyfriend.
[24:01] What are you saying brother Saqlain? He's my colleague.
[24:05] My cab broke down and he dropped me to the bus stop. Nothing else.
[24:10] Did you hear mom? One more colleague of hers is her friend now.
[24:17] Earlier you had an affair with one of your male colleagues.
[24:25] This is why you were divorced.
[24:34] Mom tell her.
[24:36] Stop her so that she doesn't test us anymore.
[24:40] What are you saying?
[24:42] I don't understand what is your problem with me?
[24:45] You wrung out a small issue and you drag it to me. Why?
[24:50] Be quiet Mahi.
[24:52] For God's sake be quiet and leave.
[24:55] But mom I'm telling the truth.
[24:56] What do you want? If I didn't die of hurt, do you want me to die of disrespect?
[25:05] Had you proven to be a little sensible, this wouldn't have happened today.
[25:11] Mahi leave. I don't want any of your clarifications.
[25:20] Go.
[25:31] If you want to handle matters yourself, you should use your brain then.
[25:37] Do you understand?
[25:41] The way Mahnoor does as she pleases, she's doing the same.
[25:48] We should shut up and not say anything to them 
[25:51] and then they present us to be insulted. Every time.
[25:56] Enough please..
[26:24] sister Areeba is right.
[26:27] I shouldn't have told you anything. 
[26:30] Had I told mom or brother Saqlain,
[26:33] nothing would be blamed to me. 
[26:36] I thought brother Saqlain would never side with us and he's not in our favor.
[26:43] But he was fighting with everyone because of us. He must be so insulted. I,
[26:52] brother Saqlain is so nice and I..
[26:57] Do you understand what I'm telling you?
[27:12] Now you tell me what should we do now?
[27:18] What can I say? We'll have to face the situation.
[27:23] Its our own house not on rent otherwise we would have left it and shifted somewhere else 
[27:28] so that everything stayed here.
[27:31] We have been disrespected. 
[27:34] People in the entire neighborhood would be talking about Ramsha.
[27:39] Our respect is gone to dirt. We're only being insulted by everyone now.
[27:47] I'd tell you to leave this house and go to the other one.
[27:53] No dear. This cannot be.
[27:55] I cannot leave this house.
[28:00] Then, we'll stop coming here because we cannot answer people.
[28:10] What are you saying? How will we not face them?
[28:14] Who are they talking about? Us or your mother? 
[28:18] We'll have to face everything.
[28:20] She's right. 
[28:22] Leaving the house isn't right and it will not solve the problem either but..
[28:28] But what?
[28:30] But we cannot shut people's mouth. 
[28:33] You're sensible. You know what should be done now.
[28:38] And as fr as I'm concerned, I'm standing with you.
[28:42] And if anyone points a finger at you, I'll break off his hand.
[28:49] But how long will we do his for?
[28:53] Rather than shutting people's mouth why don't we fix our own house?
[28:57] You're sensible yourself, you understand what I'm saying right?
[29:40] Are you alright mam? You don't look okay.
[29:43] I have a headache.
[29:46] Alright you can take some medicine.
[29:50] Faraz thank you for your advise but is it possible that we discuss this schedule after lunch break
[30:01] Whatever you say.
[30:26] Ramsha. 
[30:28] Keep this phone down 
[30:31] and you don't have to use this phone again. Understood?
[30:34] Go and bring your phone and give it to me. 
[30:37] mom
[30:38] Don't argue with me and give me your phone.
[30:44] Go..
Okay.
[31:39] Listen. 
yes
[31:41] How will that boy leave Ramsha and roaming around our house? I'm worried.
[31:48] I have found out about that boy and warned him. 
[31:52] If it still lingers around, you'll see what I do with him.
[32:01] Please be very careful. 
[32:04] I am scared of your habit because you treat every problem as your own. 
[32:09] You are troubled with the shop matter as well.
[32:14] Yes. Those problem are now showing enmity. 
[32:19] They have given a very small price for the shop as if he wants the problem to increase.
[32:26] I was thinking to appeal.
[32:30] Money is not important than your life. Be careful.
[32:36] You know the boys today are laced with weapon 
[32:39] and people in this city just take out their weapons on the smallest things.
[32:43] Why are you worried?
[32:48] Until I have you praying for me, nothing will happen to me.
But...
[32:53] Relax... I'm fine.
[33:22] Mom, you're being mean to Ramsha. 
[33:27] She has gotten her admission and she'll start her classes next week.
[33:30] Do you want her to leave everything and sit at home. Its about her future. Don't do this.
[33:37] Mahi I'm her mother. I'll decide the best for her.
[33:45] She will sit at home and I'll get her married as soon as possible.
[33:50] sister Mahnoor..
[33:52] Mom what are you saying? She's young. Her age..
[33:57] When I got married, I was younger than her.
[34:02] Mom, there's a difference between those times. Times have changed. What are you saying?
[34:08] Why? I got Areeba married as soon as she completed intermediate.
[34:12] If only I had taken this decision for you this wouldn't have happen. 
[34:18] I couldn't decide the best for you, that's why I feel I'm to blame for it.
[34:28] You were pressurized by me to say yes to the marriage but now you're free.
[34:37] You can do whatever you want to do. You can go anywhere you like, I'll not stop you. But Ramsha..
[34:49] Ramsha will not go out of the house now. In this situation, never. She'll sit at home.
[35:00] I'll ask Saqlain to not submit her fee.
[35:30] Get me a proposal according to what I've told you. 
[35:33] The boy should be from a respectable family and educated.
[35:37]  Its not a problem if he's a few years older.
[35:44] I'll tell Saqlain and Areeba and he will decide. 
[35:49] Just tell me when you talk to them. Bye.
[35:56] Mom...
[36:00] Mom why are you being so unfair to me? 
[36:04] What did I do that you're punishing me?
[36:08] This isn't a punishment dear.
[36:12] This is for your best to get married. 
[36:16] The protest you're putting up, you'll realize that I decided the best for you.
[36:24] You're wrong mom.
[36:27] This decision isn't right for me. 
[36:30] You're saying this because you don't trust me.
[36:34] You think I have an affair with that boy.
[36:38] No dear I don't think like that but the chaos outside can destroy your life.
[36:44] No, my life will not be destroyed. 
[36:48] For God's sake I beg you. I don't want to get married, I want to study. Please mom.
[36:59] Please.
Ramsha they are the same people 
[37:03] who respected your father.
[37:07] They didn't dare to look at the three of you. But today..
[37:13] So what do you think? Do you think this will shut everybody's mouth?
[37:20] In fact they will think that I had an affair. 
[37:24] Mom please I beg you. Don't get me married. Let me study. Please listen to me.
[37:32] Ramsha don't bother me.
[37:33] Mom please, I've never asked anything of you but I don't want to get married. Please mom. Please..
[38:01] I'm helpless where you're concerned
[38:05] I couldn't decide whats right for you. You said yes to the wedding because I pressurized you.
[38:19] But now you're free. 
[38:22] You do as you please. You can go anywhere.
[38:29]  I'll not stop you.
