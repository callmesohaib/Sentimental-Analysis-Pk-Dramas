[01:12] Did anything happen last night?
[01:15] You both suddenly left for Mahnoor's house.
[01:18] I mean that was it a serious problem?
[01:25] No mother! There was no such problem.
[01:30] Rimsha wanted to meet Mahnoor!
[01:34] She should meet in the morning.
[01:39] It's not important to meet at night!
[01:43] Situation of this city is not normal these days.
[01:48] Listen Faraz! Whenever you leave the house, think carefully about it.
[01:55] You both came so late at night. I couldn't sleep.
[02:03] Mother! I'll try my best not to disturb you.
[02:08] You never disturbed me my son! You are so caring towards us all.
[02:15] Your wife's problems just won't end.
[02:32] I've always let your mistakes go. This doesn't mean that you should not care about us.
[02:39] Aunt! What did I do now?
[02:42] Darling! When will you concentrate on this house. When will you stop worrying about your siblings.
[02:51] I understand that you were worried because of your mother.
[02:56] Nobody can ever rest properly after they lose their mother.
[03:08] Mother! Rimsha is lonely.
[03:11] How is she lonely? You told me that she is living with her elder sister and brother in law. How is she alone?
[03:25] Aunt! Rimsha became a little sensitive.
[03:28] Then get her married.
[03:37] For how long can you keep her secure?
[03:44] Faraz! Don't take her when Mahnoor's sister calls her at night.
[03:52] I won't say that again.
[03:55] Sure mother!
[03:57] Mahnoor! Lets go.
[04:00] Sure!
[04:01] OK mother! Goodbye.
[04:03] Goodbye!
[04:12] Mother! Faraz was lying. He is trying to cover Mahnoor's fault. Rimsha told me that they didn't went because of her.
[04:20] You should know that they had a fight with elder brother in law.
[04:26] Fight?
[04:28] Mahnoor blamed her brother in law that he poisoned her mother.
[04:34] What?
[04:37] Who told you?
[04:39] Rimsha!
[04:41] They both went to meet her at the university! They can't visit her at her house.
[04:47] I think that a big fight took place last night.
[04:53] That's why they both went
[04:58] Fine!
[05:05] Just see! He poisoned her.
[05:08] Mother! She didn't die because of the poison. She had a heart attack. Rimsha told me!
[05:14] She is doing the same there! She is busy in blaming people.
[07:02] When you are with me! Time passes like nothing.
[07:06] If you ask the truth! Its the same for me.
[07:11] I mean that time passes fast when I'm with you but I do think about my sister appearing.
[07:20] Come on! Don't worry! You won't get late when I'm around.
[07:25] You know that I have everything planned.
[07:27] Sure!
[07:31] Faraz!
[07:32] Faraz! You?
[07:34] Yes! I came here to pick her up but what is going on?
[07:38] Rimsha! You?
[07:39] We? We were...
[07:42] We came here with class fellows! There was a party in our class.
[07:49] There is no one around except you both.
[07:51] Everybody just left like a minute ago.
[07:53] Yes! Like a minute ago.
[07:55] If you want! I can call them back.
[07:58] Yes! Actually no.
[08:02] Rimsha! Mahnoor and Areeba know that you hang around with Maheer after university.
[08:08] No Faraz.
[08:11] We planned suddenly. She didn't want to! I forced her.
[08:20] Maheer! You shouldn't have done it.
[08:25] Rimsha! You should have informed about this party or get together to Mahnoor.
[08:34] You know that this would've created a problem if Saqlain saw you both together.
[08:40] Sorry Faraz!
[08:45] Anyways! Let me drop you to your home.
[08:49] Faraz! I can drop her.
[08:53] No! I think my van would be waiting. I can go by myself.
[08:58] Call and inform that you are going home.
[09:04] Come.
[09:06] Fine!
[09:07] Faraz!
[09:10] We'll talk at home.
[09:13] OK!
[09:14] Let's go!
[09:34] Faraz! Please don't tell Mahnoor about this.
[09:42] Why are you hiding it from Mahnoor?
[09:48] You know that she will scold me a lot! She'll ask me that why did I leave from university.
[09:58] Rimsha! Mahnoor is not that conservative. She is your sister. You know her better.
[10:04] She works and is independent!
[10:09] I know that she won't have an issue but if you hide such stuff from her than she might get angry.
[10:19] I won't tell Mahnoor!
[10:23] But you should inform Mahnoor! Do inform your brother in law too that you are going out with class fellows.
[10:38] A person doesn't feel scared when he informs about everything.
[10:56] Yasir! At least try to understand me.
[11:02] I'm not lying! My mother didn't allow me. Why are you getting mad at me?
[11:14] Try to understand me!
[11:27] What happened? Why are you worried?
[11:31] I'll get mad!
[11:34] Did you have a fight with Yasir?
[11:36] Why would I fight him?
[11:39] He invited me on a lunch! I took permission from mother but she didn't allow me. What my fault.
[11:45] Do you want to go? I can talk to Faraz if you want to go.
[11:50] No! Don't talk to him.
[11:57] Actually I just don't want to meet him.
[12:05] He is really weird. Do you know how he talks to me?
[12:12] He wants to know that if I had a boyfriend and who did I like in my family.
[12:22] Who talks like this?
[12:26] I feel scared when I talk to him! There's no understanding between us.
[12:34] Tell me the truth! Did Faraz ever ask you about your past?
[12:39] Did he ask you about any incidents.
[12:47] Sorry! I didn't mean it.
[12:52] You are right!
[12:54] Faraz and I have never discussed each others past.
[13:01] But I don't have any such past.
[13:04] Then tell him! 
[13:07] I've told him so many times but he won't trust me.
[13:11] I feel like he is a bit insecure.
[13:13] He is too insecure and possessive. He is always telling me about himself and how good he is.
[13:20] You should go and talk to aunt! You don't want to go and aunt is also not allowing.
[13:25] Aunt will handle it.
[13:30] You have to handle such relations with patience. Such things can turn bad after sometime.
[13:40] You understand me right? Go talk to aunt.
[13:45] Understood.
[13:55] Oh! Now Rimsha will decide?
[14:00] The rent and expenses.
[14:04] Now I really have to answer Rimsha about it?
[14:07] Areeba!
[14:09] I never answered aunt!
[14:14] About everything! All the expense was handled by me.
[14:19] No! She wasn't asking you about accounting. She was just demanding her pocket money.
[14:28] How much pocket money does she want? 5k ? 10K ? I'll give her.
[14:35] Tell her to use money properly! She shouldn't waste it. We have already spent millions on her education.
[14:42] Your fathers pension will discontinue too. How will we manage the other expenses?
[14:50] She should stop spending money on silly things.
[14:56] Sure! I'll inform.
[14:59] I was thinking of inviting someone here.
[15:04] Who?
[15:05] Tauqeer! he is my friend! I told you that I went to pick him. He is a good person.
[15:13] He was complaining that I didn't invite him over.
[15:21] Hello! What?
[15:27] What happened?
[15:29] I'm coming!
[15:31] What happened? Is everything good?
[15:33] Nothing!
[16:20] I brought a gift!
[16:23] Here!
[16:24] Wow!
[16:27] What is this?
[16:35] I thought that I should buy you a gift.
[16:42] I heard that a gift can make us love each other more.
[16:47] It nice!
[16:52] But you shouldn't trust such sayings.
[16:56] Theres nothing bad in giving a gift.
[17:00] I just wanted to give you a gift and I did! I thought about it. You never demanded a gift too.
[17:12] Gifts are never demanded! I like it.
[17:17] Right!
[17:23] Did you talk to Rimsha?
[17:25] Yes! I talked to her. She preparing for her semester finals.
[17:32] Yes! Did she tell anything else?
[17:36] No! Nothing else.
[17:39] Did you talk to her about anything?
[17:46] No! I didn't. I was just asking you about her health and is she alright?
[17:57] Everything is good. You've handled everything.
[18:01] I would've made things bad.
[18:07] Your exams are near too! How is your preparation?
[18:11] Exams! What are you talking about?
[18:15] Do you really think that I can give exams in such situation.
[18:18] You'll have to give your exams! Don't care about the result. It's must for you to give your exams.
[18:27] I'm sure that you'll pass!
[19:43] Saqlain is coming!
[19:55] What happened! What is this about?
[19:59] How should I tell you.
[20:02] Will you answer?
[20:05] Just know that we were unlucky!
[20:10] If I didn't say it to her. It wouldn't have been serious.
[20:18] The kid could've been saved!
[20:24] What have I done?
[20:34] What did you do with my son!
[20:37] Saqlain! What are you doing?
[20:40] She did nothing!
[20:44] How did it happen?
[20:46] It is a bad incident.
[20:58] I gave him money to order.
[21:04] He took all the money!
[21:06] Were you mad!
[21:09] There was no need to give him the money.
[21:12] Its my mistake!
[21:17] I didn't know that he'll scam!
[21:21] When she got to know it! She suddenly got sick. I went to hospital with her.
[21:30] We were late.
[21:39] Please forgive me Saqlain! You lost something precious because of me.
[21:45] You were worried about the money?
[21:50] I'm worried about my kid.
[22:01] Its a big loss.
[22:04] Its a shock for me.
[22:08] I couldn't handle!
[22:10] My life's dream was about to be fulfilled.
[23:01] Maheer!
[23:02] Yes brother?
[23:05] You won't take Rimsha with yourself ever again!
[23:11] But why? We class fellows go out for lunch together! What's bad in it?
[23:22] Rimsha isn't just your class fellow! She is Mahnoor's sister.
[23:26] Then what?
[23:28] I don't want anyone to blame Rimsha because of you!
[23:36] You know what I'm talking about!
[23:39] Be careful!
[23:41] Fine!
[24:18] She isn't picking up my call.
[24:23] Mahnoor! Who are you calling?
[24:26] I'm calling Rimsha! I'll ask her that why did she leave the university without informing me.
[24:32] So that she thinks that I told you!
[24:34] No! Why would you tell me.
[24:36] You ignored it because Maheer is your brother. You knew that they were both together.
[24:44] You really think that i didn't talk to you because of Maheer?
[24:51] I feel sorry for you!
[24:52] And I feel sorry for you! I never thought that you'll ignore Rimsha and Maheer together. It's nothing for you?
[25:02] I didn't tell you because I thought that Rimsha will share it with you.
[25:07] I warned Maheer too that he won't take Rimsha anywhere!
[25:10] Unless you allow him !
[25:14] I can never allow him to date my sister.
[25:18] You really hate Maheer that much?
[25:21] It's not about hate Faraz! You know the activities of Maheer.
[25:26] But he is still my younger brother.
[25:27] Rimsha is my younger sister! It's not wrong for me to care about my sister.
[25:33] I mean that I take tension because of her! Your mother didn't allow your sister to go on a lunch with Yasir!
[25:44] This is something else!
[25:46] No! It's about care.
[25:49] You know Maheer better than me. He was never serious for anything. You know better.
[25:58] You should think it yourself! If he leaves the university with Rimsha, and something bad takes place? Think!
[26:08] I have requested Maheer many times.
[26:11] But he didn't listen. Today I'll make him stop.
[26:17] Mahnoor!
[26:18] Mahnoor! Listen to me.
[26:21] What?
[26:23] I have told Maheer many times to stay away from Rimsha! I've to talk to him. He doesn't understand.
[26:46] Maheer! I've told you to stay away from Rimsha! Why won't you leave her alone?
[26:56] I also told you to stop her yourself!
[27:02] Rimsha isn't a kid!
[27:05] Behave yourself Maheer!
[27:07] You should notice how she is talking to me!
[27:11] You should stop brainwashing Rimsha! Don't take Rimsha anywhere with yourself.
[27:18] Take my Advice! Why don't you get Rimsha a neck collar and tie her in university.
[27:29] Maheer! Rimsha goes to her university so she can study!
[27:33] You are trying to spoil her! You won't lose anything but she might.
[27:38] Now she had to blame him for this?
[27:46] Maheer! What is she saying?
[27:49] What's your relation with her sister?
[27:51] There's no relation! She is just my friend and class fellow. Just like others. Let me tell you something.
[28:00] She wanted to be friends with me. I didn't ask her. She is just blaming me.
[28:12] I'm also trying to help her! I promise.
[28:19] Maheer!
[28:20] Wait Mahnoor!
[28:22] Maheer! It's fine till studies. You won't take Rimsha with yourself anywhere else!
[28:31] I didn't go alone with Rimsha!
[28:33] All the class fellows were with us! It was a party in our class. Why is she blaming me?
[28:38] You take her out!
[28:41] Darling! Blame your sister before you blame him!
[28:46] Try to handle her! If you are really concerned than warn her.
[28:52] I'll stop her.
[28:53] Yes! Stop her.
[28:55] She cannot stop her fight! And you! I'm warning you to not talk to her sister in the university!
[29:05] Do you really need friends! She should keep her sister. You don't need her.
[29:11] I'm suffering in this house because of her.
[29:17] Go inside!
[29:18] Fine!
[29:40] What did you get from this fight?
[29:42] Faraz!
[29:43] Mahnoor! You have no patience. I told you that I had warned Maheer and I talked to Rimsha about it too.
[29:57] You taunted me about my sister! You insulted Maheer. It was a proper fight. Mother is mad at you again!
[30:03] I'm sorry but I had warned Maheer many times and same goes for Rimsha!
[30:10] She also promised me that she won't!
[30:14] But still... I'm hut concerned about my little sister Faraz!
[30:20] So you mean that I'm not concerned about her respect?
[30:25] I started to drop Rimsha myself! But you!
[30:30] You only trust yourself! Thats fine.
[30:35] You can fight the world! You'll feel embarrassed afterwards.
[31:04] Where is he?
[31:15] Its good that Faraz saw us! Sister would've scolded me.
[31:20] She already knows it! She scolded me a lot.
[31:27] What? She won't ignore.
[31:31] Really? You look scared. You said that you'll support me in every situation.
[31:44] No! I'm not scared.
[31:51] I felt embarrassed in front of Faraz! Mahnoor might even kill me!
[31:56] You are my class fellow and friend! My brother didn't scold me! Your sister insulted me!
[32:09] Faraz told me that I won't go anywhere with you.
[32:13] Fine! Then don't. I don't care.
[32:17] Don't be mad!
[32:20] I'll get mad at such things.
[32:23] Fine! I'm sorry.
[32:29] You know that I can't leave you mad.
[32:33] I can also not stay mad at you!
[32:38] True?
[32:42] Who are you talking to?
[32:48] Leave the phone.
[32:51] Hello!
[32:56] Declined? Who were you talking to?
[33:01] Speak!
[33:02] I don't know! I was just..
[33:08] What are you doing? You broke the phone.
[33:14] I don't know! I was just talking to my universities friend.
[33:18] I don't know why she declined?
[33:20] Why did she decline after she heard me?
[33:26] You broke the phone so I cannot track.
[33:31] I promise! I was just talking to a friend.
[33:35] You think I'm stupid? Do I look stupid?
[33:39] I warned you not to talk on your phone late night!
[33:43] I'll tell this to Saqlain!
[33:49] I promise that I was talking to a friend.
[33:54] Don't lie!
[34:29] Where are you going?
[34:34] I'm going home! Where else?
[34:39] You could've stayed here! My health is upset to.
[34:47] Areeba is calling.
[34:50] Why is she calling?
[34:54] I don't know!
[34:57] I'm suffering!
[35:02] Saqlain! Why are you so embarrassed.
[35:11] Why shouldn't I?
[35:16] I dreamed a lot.
[35:22] I thought about her name.
[35:28] I wanted to name her a beautiful name.
[35:34] Sure! Go! You won't care about me.
[35:42] I'll be good on my own.
[35:47] Go!
[35:52] I care about you! But this also happened because of you.
[36:04] Because of me? You think that?
[36:08] I did this on purpose? Saqlain! No mother can do this to her children.
[36:30] You should have let him go! Why were you stopping him?
[36:34] You should have created a little drama too.
[36:38] He felt bad.
[36:40] He was crying but I cried because of him.
[36:48] I didn't think that he would feel so hurt.
[36:51] I thought that this person is stone hearted. But he showed his weak side.
[36:57] You have to know that he loves you!
[37:05] And do you know! I hate him so much because he embarrassed me a lot.
[37:17] I feel so good when I hurt him.
[37:23] He feels insulted.
[37:51] What happened? Is everything fine! You look weird.
[37:59] I'm worried.
[38:01] Why?
[38:03] Why worried?
[38:05] We lost something big.
[38:09] Why would someone hurt you so much?
[38:17] Loss of 5 million.
[38:25] Its a big amount! How did it happen?
[38:37] Someone looted the locker in my factory!
[38:48] It's a big shock!
[38:54] Everything is destroyed! Nothing is left.
