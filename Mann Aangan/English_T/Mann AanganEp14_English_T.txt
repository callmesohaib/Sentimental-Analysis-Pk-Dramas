[01:04] You were talking so bad about brother Saqlain.
[01:07] You were alleging him, but he's here to pay the money.
[01:12] You couldn't provide any evidence, but he proved that he is speaking the truth.
[01:28] Before things get worse, it's better that we sell the shop.
[01:32] That's why I was forced to make a deal for it for fifty lacs.
[01:43] The shop was sold according to its correct worth.
[01:47] Someone hid the truth from you stating that it was worth millions.
[01:52] Auntie this is a cheque for one million.
[01:55] Mahnoor put allegations against me without any evidence.
[01:59] I had no other option but this.
[02:02] Mahi apologize to Saqlain and return the cheque to him.
[02:10] You were talking so bad about brother Saqlain.
[02:13] You were alleging him, but he's here to pay the money.
[02:19] You couldn't provide any evidence, but he proved that he is speaking the truth.
[02:35] Sit down.
Thank you.
[02:41] Why didn't Mahnoor come? I invited you all.
[02:44] actually dear...
[02:45] Mahnoor just came back from work and she said... that she was very tired & she is not in a mood to go anywhere so I & mom
[02:53] Enough Ramsha...
[02:57] Mahnoor would have come here if she cared about our happiness.
[03:02] She only cares about herself.
[03:05] Areeba it isn't like this.
Mother don't take Mahnoor's side.
[03:11] Today it's our wedding anniversary and he didn't invite his aunt and Hashir.
[03:19] Because he didn't want Mahnoor to feel bad, and what did she do?
[03:26] She didn't include herself in our happiness.
[03:29] Enough, there must be a reason why she didn't come.
[03:34] Forget about that. Let's start eating, I'm sure everyone's hungry.
[03:41] How are things at the university? How are your studies going?
[03:55] Miss Mahnoor how was your site visit yesterday?
[03:58] Sir, very nice
[03:59] Yesterday I realized from which interval the material should arrive.
[04:03] That's really very good.
[04:05] No matter how much paperwork we do, we learn faster when we do things practically.
[04:09] Yes sir.
[04:10] We have an important meeting with the supplier tomorrow and I want you to head to that meeting.
[04:15] Mr. Faraz will be with you and finance will support you as well.
[04:20] This is a test of your managerial capabilities and I want to see how you perform.
[04:27] Sir, I will try my best not to disappoint you. I will try to meet your expectations.
[04:34] Wish you the best of luck.
Thank you, sir.
[04:44] I don't understand the MCQs, I don't know what I'll do in class.
[04:50] Ramsha... it's Mahir...
[05:11] Hi Mahir...
[05:16] Yes?
[05:16] I'm Ramsha. I'm sure you've probably seen me in class.
[05:22] Yes... I think I've seen you in class.
[05:28] Have you made your assignment?
[05:32] Which one? I just remembered... no... I still haven't.
[05:38] I mostly make them a day before... why... is everything alright?
[05:42] I don't understand a thing about that assignment.
[05:47] I mean, if you have time could you explain it to me? I mean, if you have time...
[05:52] It's nothing too complicated, it's simple and it doesn't require any logic.
[05:58] Still, I'll assist you after class.
[06:01] Thank you.
Welcome.
[06:05] Boys... let's go.
[06:15] What happened? What did he say?
[06:19] He was telling me that he'll explain it to me after class.
[06:23] Thank God, this semester had scrambled my brain.
[06:27] Anyways come on... feed me something... I'm starving.
[06:38] Mr. Faraz... is no one joining us from finance?
[06:42] No ma'am. I talked to Mr. Rashid, he told me that he'll reach their office directly.
[06:48] That means we'll have to leave together.
Yes.
[06:53] Will I go in your car? Or will you come with me in my car?
[06:58] Why don't you take your car and I take mine?
[07:03] Sure... as you wish...
I'll see you there.
[07:29] Where is Faraz? I hope the deal gets finalized today...
[07:37] Mahnoor!
[07:46] Hello...
Shall we?
[07:48] Let's go.
[07:51] Why are you so shocked?
[07:53] Don't you recognize your ex-husband?
[08:01] Your memory was never that weak. What are you doing here?
[08:06] I heard that you started a job. Have you stopped pursuing CSS?
[08:11] That's fine.
[08:14] If you need anything don't worry, tell me about it.
[08:19] No need to give yourself so much importance.
[08:22] I could never need anything from a vile man like you.
[08:28] It seems that your arrogance is still there!
[08:39] Who's this?
[08:41] Please don't say that he is the boyfriend that you left me for.
[08:46] You left me because of him.
Mind your tongue.
[08:52] I'm at my place of work, that's why I don't want to create a scene.
[08:56] Otherwise, I know how to answer back to your rudeness.
[09:01] Besides, my time is precious and I don't want to waste it on a man like you.
[09:10] Faraz, shall we?
Yes, please.
[09:26] Mother... tell me something...
[09:30] Do you think brother Faraz will agree?
[09:35] Why would Faraz have a problem with this proposal?
[09:38] Why wouldn't he? She is five years older than brother Faraz and she has a child as well
[09:46] Can't you stop bothering me? Do you think I'm a fool?
[09:52] Why would I say yes without thinking about it?
[09:56] We'll think about this.
[10:01] It's not like Faraz is getting married somewhere.
[10:06] Though...
[10:09] I did like her brother for you.
[10:15] They are wealthy people and this way we won't have to offer a dowry as well.
[10:21] This will only lessen Faraz'a burden.
[10:26] Still... don't talk to Faraz about this. I'll find the right time to talk about him.
[10:38] Will you keep sitting here? Go inside and check in on the food on the stove.
[10:51] Allow us to leave
[10:53] Stay for a while. Leave after you meet Mahi, she'll be home soon.
[10:58] No mother, this is not the time Mahnoor returns.
[11:02] Besides, she doesn't want to meet me.
[11:06] I've invited her so many times to my home, but she never comes.
[11:11] Why should I sit here and wait? Let's go...
[11:13] What are you doing? She's your younger sister...
[11:15] How long will you stay upset with her? Forget the past.
[11:28] Yes, Ashir... is everything alright? Why have you called me?
[11:35] Mahnoor?
[11:41] That's not a big deal.
[11:44] She's independent and she has a job. She can come and go anywhere she pleases.
[11:48] Did you call me to inform me about this?
[11:57] Boyfriend?
[12:05] Look... Mahnoor doesn't have a boyfriend, even if she does it should not concern you.
[12:13] Alright fine.
[12:18] I think Hashir saw Mahnoor with that guy, Faraz and he's labeling him as her boyfriend.
[12:27] Hashir has broken his relationship with her,
[12:29] it should be of no concern to him who she hangs out with.
[12:38] Anyways, forget this.
[12:41] I think we should leave now, Areeba.
[12:45] No... I'll stay with mother tonight...
[12:51] I need to talk to Mahnoor now.
[12:57] I think you're right.
[12:59] I think the way Faraz and Mahnoor are hanging out with each other...
[13:05] I've started feeling concerned for Ramsha because of it.
[13:11] After so much defamation who will bring a proposal for her?
[13:36] Please don't tell me this is your boyfriend.
[13:39] Did you leave me for this man?
[14:37] Faraz, thank God I found you here.... look at this list... I've finalized it...
[14:49] Are you alright?
[14:52] I'm perfectly fine, why wouldn't I be?
[14:55] Tell me, what were you saying?
[15:00] I've finalized this list, please check it.
Sure.
[15:05] I'll take a look at it.
[15:08] Thank you.
[15:26] Sister Areeba...
[15:28] You've stayed after a while, it seems that brother Saqlain is away somewhere.
[15:34] It's my mother's home, I don't need an excuse to stay here. Right mom?
[15:38] Besides, I do not have a habit of making excuses
[15:41] Neither have I ever made an excuse in my life.
You're right.
[15:46] Areeba has stayed here because both of us need to talk to you.
[15:53] Sit down
[15:58] Do you want to talk to me again?
[16:00] What have I done now that you two have to counsel me?
[16:05] We have endured a lot because of you.
[16:08] Just when people forget, you give them something else to talk about.
[16:12] What do you want? I admit that you're my sister, but don't punish us for that.
[16:20] You can be straightforward. Forget about the pain I've caused you...
[16:27] and come straight to the point.
[16:30] Ashir called Saqlain...
[16:33] Alright fine... what did Ashir tell brother Saqlain?
[16:38] Tell me what did he say, that you're forced to talk to me...
[16:44] Do you hear her? I told you that she would feel no shame about what she did.
[16:50] People are saying nonsense about you.
[16:54] One shouldn't feel ashamed of nonsense, because it's always lies.
[16:59] What relationship do you have with Faraz that you hang out so much with him?
[17:03] Ashir thinks that he is your boyfriend.
[17:07] Ashir... sister Areeba you might believe Ashir's nonsense, but not me...
[17:17] After all, he's done to me, you should think a thousand times before asking me such questions.
[17:25] I'm not answerable to anyone about every little thing that I do.
[17:31] I've told you a thousand times that Faraz is nothing but my colleague.
[17:35] If you keep acting so irresponsibly...
[17:40] then, mother, there will be a huge problem.
[17:48] If you have an interest in Faraz we can...
For God's sake...
[17:53] Enough... a man and woman can't only have just one sort of relationship.
[17:57] A relationship that needs to be looked at suspiciously.
[18:00] I work in the office and meet a lot of people.
[18:04] Will you join my name with someone else if you see me with someone else in the future?
[18:09] That's the thing, you work with a lot of men, but you're only seen out with one.
[18:15] People are bound to ask questions when you're always seen with one man.
[18:19] Areeba is right... one should think before talking.
[18:25] I can't do anything about your thinking.
[18:50] Sister Areeba listen to just about anyone to tell you off.
[18:57] If I were in her place, I would have taught Ashir a lesson that he would never have forgotten.
[19:04] And...
[19:06] she was saying that she didn't invite Saqlain's aunt because of you.
[19:10] After all that happened, she just wants to maintain her relationships.
[19:19] I don't know why doesn't anyone think about me.
[19:24] Why doesn't anyone think that I'm a person, I can feel pain as well.
[19:30] Why doesn't anyone care for me?
[19:34] Only because of that, I've drowned myself in so much work that no one's voice reaches me.
[19:43] Neither my family nor strangers.
[19:46] Still, they won't let me live in peace.
[19:49] They always bring something to disturb my peace.
[19:54] Why don't they leave me alone?
[19:57] At least don't cry. Aren't you strong?
[20:01] You always say that strong people don't cry, so stop crying.
[20:05] Please don't cry.
[20:23] Economics... export manager...
[20:28] I hope you understood this topic well.
[20:36] What? You still didn't understand it?
[20:44] Look... I'm explaining it one last time.
[20:46] After this, if you understand it, fine, if not, then I won't explain it to you another time.
[20:51] Got it?
[20:56] What didn't you understand?
This part is here.
[21:04] Okay...
[21:55] Mr. Faraz is quite the lackey. He's in Mahnoor's office all day.
[22:01] Buttering her up.
[22:04] Since when has Faraz been working here and where does he live?
[22:07] He's been working here for four years, but he's stuck in the same place.
[22:13] Hearing you talk...
[22:17] it seems that not many people like Faraz in the office.
[22:19] I've seen that he likes to impose himself.
[22:23] There are many things about him, there is no single reason that people don't like him.
[22:29] Meaning?
[22:30] My friend told me that he got married a few years ago...
[22:34] Wife took a divorce... a lot of other things happened as well.
[22:38] The girl's parents brought the police here.
[22:42] They had a case that Faraz had the girl's jewelry and dowry
[22:49] They put all sorts of vile allegations against him.
[22:52] Even speaking about them dirties my tongue.
[22:56] I think that's why he didn't get promoted.
[22:59] Otherwise, he would have been in Mahnoor's place right now.
[23:04] The boss decided not to be fooled by a man like him.
[23:08] After all only a respectable person can sit atop such a big post.
[23:14] A respectable person... it seems that he doesn't know a thing about Mahnoor as well.
[23:18] Anyways... things are quite despicable about Faraz. If I find out where he lives...
[23:24] then I'll see if I can use him or not.
[23:32] Sir, there was no need for this.
There is always a need.
[23:36] I should get going, I'm running later.
Yes.
[23:39] I'll visit soon.
Sure.
[23:56] What was that all about? It wasn't that hard of a topic.
[24:00] I understood it the first time, but you asked him to repeat it three times.
[24:06] It's nothing like that. I was just taking his attention.
[24:11] I mean... he was sitting in front of me, and I was looking at his face.
[24:18] Hello... have you fallen over heels for him, like the rest of the girls.
[24:25] It's nothing like that. I just wanted to make all of the girls jealous.
[24:30] Didn't you see how every girl was jealous when he was sitting with me?
[24:38] Ramsha, you're quite sharp.
[24:43] That is true. Shall we go now?
Sure.
[25:00] Tea...
[25:04] What?
Tea.
[25:07] Yes.. thank you.
[25:18] Don't go anywhere today. You were late last night as well.
[25:25] When you come home late, I feel anxious.
[25:34] Actually, I got busy last night, that's why I was late.
[25:36] What were you doing so late at night?
[25:40] When one has their own business, then one makes their own time.
[25:46] Anyways, I'll try to come back early today, alright?
[25:53] Tell me... did you talk to Mahnoor?
[25:59] Yes, I did... she started talking back at me.
[26:04] She said that she will not give any explanations.
[26:08] Mother and Ramsha are upset with me as well.
[26:11] This girl, even lawyers would lose an argument to her.
[26:18] We cannot win.
[26:22] I'll get going now.
[26:26] And yes... if I ever get late, don't worry...
[26:30] But I do get worried.
[26:32] That's what I'm saying, don't get worried.
[26:36] After all... you're my wife, so be brave.
[27:03] Greetings*
[27:06] Yes?
[27:06] Do you live here?
Yes, I do.
[27:10] Do you know a Faraz... he lives around here somewhere.
[27:15] The tall one, with the old car?
[27:18] Yes... something like that.
[27:20] Not only me, the entire neighborhood knows about him.
[27:24] You can ask every child here and they'll tell you how vile a man he is.
[27:32] Could you tell me in detail, because we have a proposal from him for my sister
[27:36] and I wanted to investigate him?
[27:40] Don't marry your sister to him. He made his first wife's life hell.
[27:46] I heard so many screams of that innocent soul from that house.
[27:53] I cannot even describe it. I think he used to beat her as well.
[27:57] Then one day, he ousted her from the home.
[28:00] The poor girl left home with no shoes and without a scarf.
[28:05] That is quite sad... but thank you, sir...
[28:10] that you told me all of this...
Thank you.
[28:22] Really...
[28:25] Faraz is a good man for Mahnoor.
[28:46] Mother... tell me something...
[28:52] Why were they asking so many questions about brother?
[28:58] I was thinking about that as well.
[29:03] Who was that guy asking so many questions about Faraz?
[29:08] That too from that wretched Asim.
[29:11] I'm sure he must have talked badly about my son.
[29:17] But mother, aunt was saying that she has told them everything.
[29:21] Then why would they inquire about brother?
[29:25] That's what's surprising. It's not their daughter is bejeweled.
[29:33] I invited them here for you because the guy seemed nice...
[29:39] but they started asking questions about Faraz.
[29:47] Mother...
[29:51] I told you not to talk about my marriage right now.
[29:55] Why do you want to embarrass me?
[29:59] but dear...
Have you any idea how I feel...
[30:02] when people ask questions about me? I don't even go out to the shop.
[30:06] People talk about me over there, that's why I don't go there.
[30:12] My dear child... people are used to talking. People don't care about anyone
[30:19] And Asim, he's jealous of you.
[30:23] Why would he be jealous of a cursed man like me?
[30:28] What do I have? A nine-to-five job... that old car... and father's home...
[30:35] What else? My wife left me saying that I was incomplete and abnormal...
[30:44] She left me... and you still think...
[30:48] that someone could envy an unsuccessful man like me?
[30:53] No, my dear, she lied! All of us know...
[31:00] she alleged you.
[31:03] You and I know that, but the world doesn't. They think that what she said was the truth.
[31:07] I beg you... don't talk about my marriage.
[31:13] For how long should I do that?
[31:19] Those people brought their son's proposal for their son.
[31:25] They want you to marry their daughter. It's a good proposal.
[31:31] But...
[31:32] But what?
[31:38] The thing is that the girl's age is a little high...
[31:45] And on top of that...
And what?
[31:51] She has a child as well...
[31:58] Brother.
[32:34] They brought a proposal for Aima. They want you to marry their daughter.
[32:41] The girl's age is high and she has a child as well.
[33:02] What is the matter brother Saqlain? Why did you come here?
[33:06] It seems that you didn't like me coming here. It's not like that.
[33:11] What was so important that you had to come here? You could have talked to me at home.
[33:17] That's why I'm asking.
[33:19] It had been a while since you started working so I decided...
[33:22] that I should look at the place you work.
[33:24] Did you come here to keep an eye on me or find new breaking news?
[33:34] Mahnoor, why do you think so badly about me?
[33:38] Even though you have been rude to me in the past...
[33:42] but I've always thought the best for you and that hasn't changed.
[33:47] If you want...
[33:52] you can ask Areeba if I scolded Ashir over what he did. Even auntie is a witness to that.
[33:56] But if you're having an affair with your office colleague Faraz...
[34:03] Faraz...
[34:05] I'm busy right now, you can come by later, and I'll message you. Thank you.
[34:18] It's good you order him around.
[34:22] As you should, it will come in handy in the future.
[34:28] I don't think he's from a good family background.
[34:32] He seems like someone from a low-class family background.
[34:34] To tell you the truth, I don't think he's worthy of you.
Brother Saqlain...
[34:40] you came here to talk about something, right? This is where I work...
[34:45] this is affecting my work badly.
[34:48] If you want to talk about this nonsense then you can do that at home.
[34:54] Alright... I came here to talk to you about that house.
[34:59] It's getting worse day by day and I want to demolish it.
[35:05] Before it gets worse, we should think about what to do with it.
[35:10] I've seen you many times speaking ill towards others.
[35:15] I've ignored this in the past, but I won't anymore.
[35:18]  I'll teach you a lesson so that you don't ever think of doing this again.
[35:21] What is that noise?
You're being unjust... let go of me.
[35:26] I can do this for you as well.
Do you even have the courage to hold me?
[35:32] What is going on here? What are you doing? Let go of him.
[35:36] I won't let go of him, I'll teach him a lesson today.
[35:39] Faraz, enough is enough. You can't act like a thug at work.
[35:43] You should be ashamed of holding your colleague like that.
I feel no shame!
[35:47] Keep out of this issue, I know how to handle this. Besides, both of them come under me.
[35:52] And you work under me. Do I need to remind you that I'm your boss?
[35:58] You're not my boss!
[36:02] If you want to impose your power then file a complaint against me and send the one who you're so fond of...
[36:08] I'll leave after I get my termination letter, but before that, I won't spare him!
[36:27] Get out of the office right now.
[36:31] Otherwise, I'll call the police... I said leave!
[36:46] Whatever happened, I'll talk to the boss about it.
[36:52] You guys can go back to work.
[36:57] Okay.
[37:01] What are you all looking at? Go and do your work!
[37:19] What an interesting character...
[37:21]  he's the perfect choice for an arrogant girl like you.
[37:26] This psycho is great... I have no objections.
[37:31] It's a yes as far as I'm concerned.
[37:38] Sir... I didn't expect Faraz to behave like this.
[37:45] If there was an issue it could have complained. Fighting as he did...
[37:52] When I tried stopping him, he misbehaved with me as well.
[37:56] Faraz has a mild demeanor and in my opinion, he's a very calm and decent guy.
[38:01] I don't understand why he would act that way.
[38:05] He's in a very calm way, even though he respects you.
[38:09] That could all be just for show. 
[38:12] I know personal attacks can hurt, but they can be answered decently as well.
[38:19] The same people at work gossiped about me as well.
[38:24] But I decently answered them.
Wait... about you?
[38:30] I know that people talk about Faraz at work...
[38:35]  but what is this gossip about you?
[38:38] Why don't I know about it, even though I'm the chief of the company? 
[38:42] Miss Mahnoor you better speak up now!
[38:45] Tell me, so that I can take action against them.
[38:49]  What is the reason behind them not respecting their seniors?
[38:52] How come they are insulting their seniors behind their backs?
[38:55]  Is this the company we're running?
[38:59] It's that I...
[39:03] I'm divorced.
[39:09] My marriage broke off...
But miss Mahnoor in your CV...
[39:13] that's because I only had a marriage ceremony, which is now over. 
[39:17] That's why I put myself down as single in my CV.
[39:24] I see...
[39:33] Greetings sir.
[39:36] What's the problem with you two? What am I hearing about you two?
[39:40] Sir, we didn't do anything... Faraz was the one who was arguing.
[39:45] Do you expect someone to remain quiet while you pass on personal comments? 
[39:50] Who gave you the right to gossip about your senior's personal life?
[39:54] This is my first and final warning. 
[39:56] I don't want to hear any complaints about you two again
[40:00] Understand? 
I'm sorry sir, this won't happen again.
[40:05] Sorry, sir...
Alright... you guys can leave.
[40:13] Some people have a habit of gossiping.
[40:19] And it's not hard for them to find a topic. Lord knows what they must say about me.
[40:23] I've warned them in front of you. You can attend to Mr. Faraz yourself.
[40:28] He misbehaved with you in front of the entire staff and that can't be ignored.
[40:32] Make a charge sheet and file a complaint against him.
[40:37] We'll take a look at it and we'll take full action.
