[01:14] Why aren't you listening to me?
 Listen to me just once. I just want to meet Ramsha once. Just once..
[01:32] Faraz now you make him understand that he cannot meet her.
[01:38] Please I beg of you. Please let me meet Ramsha once. I want to see if she's okay or not. Please..
[01:48] You cannot meet Ramsha. She's in mourning.
[02:41] Please forgive me once Faraz. I'll apologize to your mother. I'll apologize to everyone.
[02:55] Don't leave me alone. I hurt you very much. I defamed you everywhere. Please forgive me.
[03:59] Will you hate me for it?
I don't even want to hate you.
[05:50] Go away. Get out. Get out!
[05:57] Get out. This is my mother's house.
[06:18] Hello?
You have the papers of the house?
[06:23] Yes sir, I have the file.
Come to my office with them, fast.
[06:29] All right, I'll just bring them.
[06:37] Now I'll see how Areeba throws me out of that house.
[07:43] Saqlain.. You didn't tell her. Come one tell her who I am.
Yes, she's my wife. I married her.
[08:33] Where are the two of you going?
Mom, we're going to the office.
[08:39] But dear, you were up all night, you should get some rest.
Yes we've rested enough. Work is important. We will meet Areeba and Ramsha on our way.
[08:54] Alright. What can I say right now? I don't understand anything.
[09:05] But I do know that you're very strong. You'll support your sisters well. But whatever is written in our fate, good or bad..
[09:20] Don't worry, God will make everything alright.
[09:25] If you and Faraz hadn't supported me in this bad time, I would have lost my courage.
[09:39] God will make everything better. As God wills.
As God wills.
[09:44] Thank you aunty.
Go ahead dear. And give my love to your sisters.
[09:55] Bye.
May God take care of you. Bye.
[10:58] Please eat something Ramsha.
[11:15] I cannot eat anything.
[11:37] You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. Please eat a little.
I will not be able to eat.
[11:55] Don't say that. 
[12:01] I feel embarrassed.
[12:11] Areeba.. why did mom leave me alone and went away?
[12:22] Didn't she know that after she died, I would be very alone.
[12:30] You're not alone. Mahnoor and I.. all of us are with you.
[12:41] Come on get up. Get out of here.
[12:46] Saqlain..
Don't speak in front of me. Don't you dare.
[12:57] Get up and get out. Right now. Get out..
Saqlain.. Saqlain...
[13:13] She and Mahnoor have destroyed everything. I'll tend to Mahnoor myself. And you.. get out right now.
[13:20] Who are you to throw Ramsha out?
I own this house and you're permitted to live here only because you're my wife.
[13:28] Nobody can live here without my permission.
Stop this. How can you own this house? This is our mother's house. It belongs to all three of us sisters.
[13:35] This is our property.
This house is my property. If you don't believe me, look at these papers. Your mother gave this house to me.
[13:59] How can this be?
[14:06] How could aunty not ask her children and give you her house? You must have forced her to sign.
[14:22] This must be it. Mom would never decide something this big. This is why you tried to kill mom by poisoning her.
[14:30] You can only blame me. You don't have proof. Now shut up with your drama and get out. And take your sister along.
[14:41] Don't interfere.. Don't say anything in front of me or else...
[14:47] What? What will you do? What?!
Areeba...
[15:14] Areeba? Areeba?
[15:28] Hey.....
[15:56] Faraz, don't talk to this cheap man and lets call the police. Faraz...
[17:13] I should have just thrown Areeba out with everyone but right now I'm bound. I don't want to lose my child.
[17:25] Just a few months more. I'll teach her well. Saqlain is my name.
[17:39] Look at these women. The have left the gate open for the thieves to come and steal everything.
[17:46] But what will they lose? Its all my money.
[17:59] Who are you people? How did you come inside? Fariya?
Oh brother. Breathe at least.
[18:05] At least let us explain. We own this house, we're not thieves.
[18:09] What nonsense is this? I'm the owner. How can you be so?
Wait a minute. You don't have to be ill mannered.
[18:16] I bought this house two days ago from the women who lived here. The transfer is in my name.
[18:29] How can this be? Fariya cheated me and sold this house.
[18:36] But how can this be?
If you want to challenge, you can go to the court with me. Everything will be settled.
[18:43] But brother I have a lot of valuables inside.
Nothing is inside. The house is empty. If you want you can go inside and check.
[18:56] Alright.
[19:10] Rameez, this has all the cash and jewelry. Please keep this safe with you.
[19:18] Don't worry Fariya. I'll take care of.
I did everything for you Rameez. I don't want us to face any problems in the future.
[19:31] Just let us escape from here. I'll file a divorce case against Saqlain and he'll have to divorce me.
[19:41] And as it is, he is surrounded by so many problems. He cannot do anything.
Yes that he is. Don't worry. Saqlain won't find out anything.
[19:51] And as it is, we would have left the city by then.
[19:54] And tell me what about the payment of the house?
I'll get the payment in my account by tomorrow.
[20:01] Your account? I mean, didn't you take cash from them?
Who will pay such a big amount in cash, Fariya?
[20:10] And as it is, you have no account and you don't use the one you have.
Oh yes. It was a joint account with Saqlain.
[20:20] As it is, you and I are one.
We're one and together.
[20:32] I'll just go and keep this bag.
[21:31] Don't worry about me, nothing will happen to me.
Why shouldn't I worry about you?
[21:38] Who do I have in this world except you?
[21:45] How can this be? How can Fariya cheat me? I loved her..
[22:50] I seem to not get better at all.
[23:01] And then Faraz's worries. I'm just scared thinking about them.
[23:12] That wretched Saqlain. He shouldn't harm my son.
[23:21] And Maheer has put me in trouble too. He is punishing me as if Ramsha's wedding broke because of me.
[23:37] Oh stupid.. Why is he forgetting that he had to bear so much because of he?
[23:47] He had to visit the courts and was thrown out of his university.
[24:01] Faraz is saying that once his education is completed he'll get him a good job somewhere.
[24:16] Oh God..
[24:22] How will I talk to Faraz? Yasir has such big demands.
[24:38] Car.. How will we give him a car in the dowry?
[24:51] Oh God.. Where am I trapped?
[25:02] What will I do?
[25:24] Will you keep reading the papers or will you tell me if something can be done?
No sir.
[25:34] I should have understood when her mother asked me to give her the house as a wedding present.
She did the same as you did with your in laws..
[25:44] I mean..
They dared.. both of them deceived me and left.
[25:55] I'll kill her. I'll find her no matter where she is and kill her.
Mr. Saqlain?
[26:07] Yes tell me?
We're here to arrest you.
[26:12] But why? What did I do?
You're accused of forging documents against your mother in law and trying to kill her.
[26:22] And now you're behaving violently with your wife and her sisters and throw them out of their house. Your wife and her sisters filed this complaint. You'll have to come to the police station.
[26:34] By the way those women are lying but I'll come with you.
[26:43] Get me a bail as soon as possible and find that mother and daughter. I need them at all costs.
Okay sir.
[26:54] Lets go.
[27:20] Are you joking? This is our mother's house. This is our house.
This house belongs to me and nobody else.
[27:30] If you don't belive me see this papers. Your mother named this house to me.
[28:07] Areeba.. Are you alright?
[28:15] Yes I'm fine. 
If you don't feel better. I'll ask Mahnoor to take you to the hospital.
[28:27] No I'm fine. Don't worry for me.
[28:37] Please come here and sit here.
[28:52] Now leave everything and please eat a little.
[29:06] I don' feel like eating anything. I'll eat later.
You have to take care of yourself. Please eat a little.
[29:18] You have to take care of yourself.
[29:25] See you have turned all pale.
[29:36] We'll not cry anymore. They say..
[29:45] Crying makes a person weak. We will not cry. 
No we won't. We'll not cry.
[30:02] We'll not cry anymore.
[30:18] You're hungry right. Please eat a little.
[30:47] Please eat. You're hungry.
[32:11] Ramsha? Come on get up. Lets go home.
[32:19] He will not let me go.
He cannot stop you. I'll take you along. Come.
[32:35] End this relationship right now. Free her right now. 
I divorce you.
[34:23] Why is her number off? Its been so many days.
[34:29] What if Ramsha doesn't have her phone?
[34:39] How should I apologize to her? How can I accept the mistakes I made in front of her?
[35:00] I am the biggest person at fault here.
[35:50] Faraz? What are you upset about Yasir? Its my fault. I should have talked about it.
[36:03] You got embarrassed because of Yasir. I know his mentality very well. I expected this of that stupid person.
[36:15] If I wanted I could crush his pride there but then what difference would it leave between me and him. If his education couldn't do anything for him, what would I do?
[36:28] You're right. But I've been thinking, I will resign in a few days.
[36:37] After that, how will you handle him. Nasir had been complaining about him.
[36:48] If I had been in your place, I would have told Nasir to take Yasir's complaint to the management and not to us.
You're forgetting our relationship with Yasir.
[37:02] This is why I'm helpless. Oh well. Right now, we should discuss about your important issue.
[37:16] Right now the most important thing is that Saqlain shouldn't get bail at all.
He won't and the case would go in court soon.
[37:36] Should I make coffee for you?
Of course. Thank you.
[38:34] This is weird. Who made you a lawyer? You cannot handle a small case.
[38:41] This isn't an ordinary case. You're taking it casually. Mahnoor has involved so many people. She has a very powerful lawyer.
[38:50] I would have gotten your bail..
Talk to Areeba. Tell her to come meet me. I'll give her the house and Fariya..
[38:59] I'll divorce her. She should just forgive me once.
I went to meet her before you and she threw me out.
[39:07] And she told me she had no relationship with you.
Then what are you here for? Go and do something.
[39:15] They will shift you to the jail in a few days. I'll do something then.
What about Fariya?
[39:25] Find her from anywhere and bring her to me.
Yes sure.
[39:38] He is shouting on me without any reason. He doesn't see what he does. He had to get caught one day.
