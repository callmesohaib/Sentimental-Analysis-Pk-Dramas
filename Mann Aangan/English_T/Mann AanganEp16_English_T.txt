[01:11] Maheer, did you find anything about brother Faraz?
[01:14] How can I find out?
[01:16] Did you go to police station to check?
[01:21] I did. I went to the police station close to his office but he wasn't there
[01:33] Where have they taken my child?
[01:36] In what condition would he be?
[01:38] Will I get food or not?
[01:45] Give him food
[01:48] How selfish you are.
[01:50] God knows in what condition your brother is and here you want to eat?
[01:56] Fine, I'll starve if that is how brother Faraz can be found
[02:03] Mother?
[02:03] Leave him. He won't die
[02:08] God know if someone has given my child food?
[02:12] Who knows if he ate something or not
[02:20] Mother, have water
[02:24] Don't cry. Everything will be fine
[02:26] In what condition would my Faraz be?
[02:35] Its morning and he still isn't there. His phone is switched off too
[02:43] Where were you the whole night?
[02:47] I did message you and inform you that I had to go to Hyderabad in an emergency situation.
[02:52] It was too late so I didn't find it appropriate to travel so I stayed at a friend's place there.
[02:57] but why was your phone off? I kept calling you the whole night.
[03:01] Your number started responding but you switched it off again
[03:06] Sometimes a person gets stuck in a situation where he can't attend the call.
[03:11] I could be in trouble too
[03:14] yes! I didn't think about it. What is your problem?
[03:20] No! There is no problem. Even if I'd tell you, what solution would you give me?
[03:27] Now tell me, why were you calling me again and again?
[03:30] And Mahnoor called me many times too. I couldn't call her back
[03:33] Mahnoor came. She was saying that you filed a harassment case on her colleague?
[03:38] Yes I did.
[03:40] He was threatening Mahnoor in front of me. So I thought to teach him a lesson. Also ..
[03:48] Mahnoor was being humiliated everywhere because of her. I had to take an action
[03:53] I thought, she would get rid of that guy this way
[03:57] She was very upset. She was saying that why did you do this harassment case?
[04:02] Faraz isn't like this. His reputation would suffer at office now
[04:06] Doing a favor to your sister is like doing a sin. Its the same case ..
[04:13] I am a fool who always wants to do good to her. But end up being a criminal
[04:19] now see, the other day she was defending herself as if she has no link with Faraz
[04:26] Anyways, I don't want to discuss this matter right now. I'm too tired
[04:31] I'm awake since whole night and then traveled back.
[04:34] You make me breakfast. I want to sleep afterwards
[04:36] Yes, I'm bringing it
[04:44] Whole night has passed
[04:47] My son hasn't come back
[04:50] Mother, you haven't eaten anything since night. You'd get sick. Please have tea at least
[04:57] No!
[04:59] I don't want to.
[05:02] I can't even drink water.
[05:05] May God ruin those people who did this to my child
[05:14] how do we take him out? We don't know anyone
[05:20] Earlier, people in Faraz's office ..
[05:23] Ask Maheer to go to his office and talk to them
[05:29] go and wake him up
[05:31] I'll talk. You have this tea
[05:34] Leave it. You go
[05:37] Go!
[05:59] Hello? Greetings
[06:02] Yes, I asked Aneeqa.
[06:06] Which police station. Fine. I'm coming
[06:11] Thank you so much. I'll go and talk myself first.
[06:15] I'll let you know if I need you. Thank you so much
[06:19] Mahi, where are you going? Have breakfast
[06:21] Mother, I will get late. I have to go bail Faraz out of police station
[06:26] What? Will you go to police station?
[06:29] Its obvious. I'd have to go to take the complaint back
[06:32] An innocent person spent his night in jail because of me.
[06:36] Can't I even go to bail him out? I'd have to go
[06:39] But Mahi?
[06:42] I'll come and tell you.
[06:53] Look, neither you are not letting me contact my home nor any lawyer for my bail
[06:58] This is unfair, honestly
[07:01] We didn't do unjust to you. You tell me yourself, you stayed here the whole night.
[07:08] Did we give you any trouble? No, right.
[07:12] Have this. Either call your family or a lawyer
[07:26] Greetings!
[07:28] Greetings! I'm sure you are Mahnoor. Sit
[07:37] Speak up?
[07:40] I want to take this complaint back without any pressure
[07:52] Mr. Faraz is innocent. Neither he harassed me nor threatened me
[07:58] But your brother in law was too worried regarding you.
[08:01] He was also saying that you had a fight with him and he is humiliating you everywhere
[08:06] There was some misconception. Faraz isn't like this. He is a good person.
[08:12] He never misbehaved with me. Infact, he has always supported me in office
[08:19] This is the result of a misconception.
[08:24] Hence, I want to take my complaint back. Its a request to release him
[08:34] Fine!
[08:35] As you say, but tell me one thing.
[08:38] If there wasn't any problem then why did you people waste police time?
[08:44] If police doesn't take action then it is police that is bad.
[08:47] But if it takes action, then the story comes out different
[08:52] God knows when will you people get sense
[08:56] Inspector, I'm sorry for trouble. It won't happen ever
[09:09] Sign here
[09:19] Fine, you can take him
[09:23] Release him
[09:26] Thank you!
[10:58] Faraz?
[11:07] Umm
[11:09] Actually, I'm embarrassed for whatever happened. I'm sorry
[11:16] Brother Saqlain didn't even let me know about it.
[11:20] If I had an idea, I wouldn't have let it happen
[11:25] I'm not worried about what happened.
[11:28] I'm stressed for what is going to happen.
[11:31] Everyone has come to know at office. I have no idea how to face them
[11:38] Its not just you. Even my name is ruined.
[11:43] I have to clarify things to everyone too
[11:47] Lets do one thing, lets go to office together.
[11:50] Infact, first lets go to your house.
[11:56] Once your family has seen you, they'd be satisfied.
[11:59] After that, we'll go to office together. I'll explain everything to boss.
[12:04] I want to solve this problem today. What do you say?
[12:15] Shall we go?
[12:16] Okay!
[12:38] Where were you? Why did you take so much time
[12:40] I'll tell you why
[12:42] Maheer? My child, did you go to brother's office? Did you find out anything?
[12:46] Yes, I have. I went to brother's office.
[12:51] I found it out there that brother has been caught in harassment case.
[12:55] It was filed by his manager. Her name is Mahnoor. She is the same person brother had a fight with
[13:00] No Maheer, that problem is already solved
[13:04] I don't know if its the same problem or not
[13:07] what can be the other matter?
[13:10] Mother you don't know what happens when a female colleague files an harassment case.
[13:15] It might be possible that brother Faraz ..
[13:16] No, it isn't possible. My son can never do any such thing.
[13:20] Faraz has never seen anyone with wrong intention
[13:24] He'd do this to his boss? May God ruin his boss. She's telling a lie
[13:32] Mother?
[13:35] O Faraz, my son
[13:38] Are you fine?
[13:39] Thanks to God brother that you are back. Do you know how much we were worried
[13:46] why did police take you? Maheer was saying that some Mahnoor ..
[13:51] No mother, it was a misconception
[14:00] this is Ms. Mahnoor
[14:05] She has taken complaint back and case is over
[14:10] Ms. Mahnoor, you sit here for a while. I'll go and change. Then we'll leave
[14:15] Where are you going?
[14:18] Mother, I have to go to office. I came to tell that I'm fine
[14:24] hmm .. come
[14:42] Sir, you can't go inside
[14:47] what do you mean?
[14:48] Madam, boss has restricted Mr. Faraz to enter the office
[14:56] We are going to talk to boss
[14:58] Madam, sir said that he'd call Mr. Faraz himself. For now, he's not allowed
[15:04] Okay! I want to get my stuff from inside. I might have this permission?
[15:09] Sir, you come with me and take your stuff in front of me
[15:12] One second
[15:14] Faraz, I'll go and talk to boss
[15:20] Sir, you wait on the side
[15:31] Sir, this was just a misunderstanding and its clear now
[15:36] Ms. Mahnoor, I think you didn't see today's newspaper. Look at this,
[15:41] this is a two liner news but its a big problem.
[15:45] In few hours, it might become a social media trend too
[15:51] but sir, this is false. I myself am telling you that this isn't true
[15:56] I know its not true.
[15:58] By taking the complaint back and releasing Faraz from jail, you have proven it.
[16:03] But this company's reputation can be effected a lot with all this
[16:07] Be thankful that higher manager only took action against Faraz. No one talked about you.
[16:13] But if they'd find out that complaint was false, then they would like to talk to you as well
[16:19] Sir, I have no problem in talking and clarifying things. But its injustice to Mr. Faraz.
[16:26] He is being punished for the crime he hasn't done.
[16:30] Also, you like Faraz a lot too
[16:33] Yes, I do. Infact, I got him bailed out the last time.
[16:40] These both are different things. It was a harassment issue. Such things are huge
[16:47] Please, help me solving this problem.
[16:50] This job is important to me but not as important as it is for Mr. Faraz.
[16:55] I won't be able to forgive myself if he's being treat unjustly because of me
[17:00] Please sir
[17:02] fine! I'll inform you. Lets see what happens
[17:05] Higher management would talk to you.
[17:08] To be honest, I also don't want Faraz to lose his job
[17:12] but lets see what happens
[17:15] Last decision is taken by higher management. I'm also an employee like you
[17:21] right!
[17:30] Areeba?
[17:35] Yes
[17:38] Yes?
[17:38] Keep this money
[17:43] This much money?
[17:45] Yes, contractor asked me money so I took them out of bank
[17:50] then he left the city for a week. Anyways, keep it carefully. Its 2.5 million rupees
[17:56] 2.5 million?
[17:59] why are you giving him such a big amount in cash?
[18:02] I was going to pay by cheque. He said, he wants it in cash
[18:07] anyways, keep it safe
[18:08] I'll take it from you when I'd have to give it to him
[18:10] I'll keep it safe
[18:11] I'll leave now. Also, get ready in evening
[18:16] we'll go out for dinner
[18:19] hmm
[18:20] hmm? bye!
[18:23] bye!
[18:31] Where will I keep this large amount of money?
[18:37] I'll hide it upstairs under the bed. No! I'll keep it here in cupboard
[18:50] Look at this. Wow!
[18:53] In few hours, it got 1000 of likes and views. Such news is prevailed quickly
[18:58] Right!
[19:00] Mr. Faraz, you and here? I mean, how did police leave you so soon?
[19:07] Mahnoor has taken back her false complaint
[19:11] I see. This means that madam Mahnoor brought you back after so much?
[19:18] Amazing!
[19:19] Because that was a fake complaint
[19:22] Forgive me Mr. Faraz, complaint can be fake.
[19:25] But Ms. Mahnoor helping you besides all this gossip is so weird
[19:33] Look at the social media, Ms. Mahnoor is being humiliated a lot along with you.
[19:40] Read the comments. You both are a drama.
[19:49] I have to agree with one thing
[19:52] Madam Mahnoor has a big heart
[19:54] May be she has fallen in love with Mr. Faraz, this is why she is doing too much
[19:58] by the way, did you upload this all on social media?
[20:05] Who else can do it other than me?
[20:09] He held my collar
[20:12] Yes, I have left the house and my wife has the money
[20:19] Have patience. There is no need to do so soon.
[20:22] We'll do it in few days.
[20:26] Also, there shouldn't be any mistake otherwise you know me.
[20:33] Be very careful.
[20:38] fine! bye
[21:16] What is it? Why have you brought me here? Anything special?
[21:21] umm .. yes
[21:23] I know it very well. Are you worried about your job?
[21:28] I'm standing with you in this matter.
[21:32] Also, it is my responsibility to help you resume your job. Don't take tension
[21:37] I have a meeting with boss tomorrow
[21:38] I have been blamed falsely one more time .. And again the reason was a woman
[21:48] Everyone saw my drama earlier
[21:53] Her family sent police at my home
[21:59] Why do I get insulted because of a woman every time.
[22:04] it isn't you
[22:08] infact, to make me suffer you are being used
[22:13] your name is being connected to mine deliberately to insult me
[22:23] God willing, things will be fine. You will get back your job. Its a promise
[22:40] Will you marry me?
[22:56] what?
[23:00] Are you gone mad? Do you even have an idea what you are saying?
[23:05] I'm working hard to get you your job back and you ..
[23:09] Please listen to me
[23:11] No more words or else I'll lose my patience
[23:15] I thought you are different from other men
[23:22] but I was wrong about you.
[23:25] There is no difference between you and others
[24:21] Will you marry me?
[24:29] Sister?
[24:30] hmm?
[24:31] are you fine?
[24:35] Yes, I'm fine
[24:37] it doesn't look like that from your face.
[24:40] You weren't home the whole day and now you look so stressed. Is that matter solved?
[24:48] Yes, its solved
[24:51] Tell me, is there any problem?
[24:55] do you have a problem regarding job?
[24:59] Everything is fine. I'm just having headache. Make me tea
[25:06] I'll bring it. Shall I bring medicines too?
[25:09] No, I have taken medicine. Bring me tea
[25:12] okay!
[26:13] Yes mother?
[26:17] what happened my child, where were you the whole day?
[26:21] I went to office. I told you
[26:26] You spent the whole night in stress and kept working at office.
[26:33] You should have come earlier and rest
[26:37] Now I'll rest. Until I get a new job, I'll sit at home and rest
[26:46] what?
[26:49] Your job?
[26:50] Yes mother, the consequences of this case are huge
[27:00] but that was all lie. Mahnoor was with you as well
[27:05] She was with me, but I don't think so she'd be now
[27:15] Anyways ..
[27:18] you don't worry. From tomorrow, I'll start looking for a new job.
[27:24] I'll get a good one if God wills. You pray
[27:29] My child, everything will be fine. Don't you worry. Shall I bring tea for you?
[27:37] No, I'm fine mother
[27:41] True?
[27:51] Are you fine, Faraz?
[28:48] Hello?
[28:51] Yes Faraz, speak up?
[28:55] I .. I want to apologize
[29:03] I proposed you without even thinking
[29:12] I know that you don't deserve me
[29:15] you just ignore what I said. Because ..
[29:19] I know that you are worried, what if I'll step back from helping you?
[29:26] Don't take tension, I'm with you until you resume your job back
[29:32] I am not worried about my job.
[29:35] I'll start looking for it from tomorrow. If not higher position, I know I'll get an average one
[29:42] I truly respect you.
[29:45] People are joining your name with mine, and making assumptions. For that I ..
[30:01] Look, I'm a very simple person. I don't know how to be clever
[30:12] I think that you are insulted because of me and ..
[30:53] Sister?
[30:55] Come here quickly
[31:04] what happened? why are you shouting?
[31:07] Look at this
[31:09] what?
[31:09] what is being written about you on social media?
[31:13] I mean, they have mentioned something opposite. This shows that you had an affair
[31:18] They aren't mentioning what the actual thing was
[31:29] Aren't you both slept?
[31:32] mother, look at this
[31:34] what happened now?
[31:35] Sister's pictures are there on social media.
[31:38] I mean, there is a news that sister had an affair with her colleague.
[31:47] This all happened because of brother Saqlain.
[31:51] Why is he after me? I think he won't live me peacefully until I'm alive
[31:57] you do one thing, you leave this job and do something else.
[32:01] What will happen then? Will this scandal leave me?
[32:05] Today, they are joining my name with Faraz. Tomorrow they will do it with someone else.
[32:10] I wanted to get rid of this but then what happened? Something I was afraid of.
[32:17] Tell me, how will I get rid of this now?
[32:21] Don't be scared.
[32:32] Shakila, I wanted to say
[32:36] I don't have an objection on that proposal
[32:39] Ask them to wait for 1 or 2 week. I'll talk to Faraz ..
[32:43] You don't have an objection, but they have clearly refused
[32:46] why so? They were very much ready earlier
[32:51] Hey, they did your son's inquiry and said too much to me. They asked me to show a proposal of a decent family
[32:57] Tell me one more thing, is this a new issue?
[33:03] no, who said that to you?
[33:06] Look, you don't hide anything from doctor or a lawyer.
[33:09]  If you won't tell me the truth, then I won't help you next time
[33:14] Is it about a girl? I heard that Faraz ..
[33:18] O no .. This is all lie
[33:22] Really? He stayed one night in jail for this? 
[33:27] Wow! Why does every girl puts blame on Faraz? 
[33:31] Earlier you said the same, when his ex wanted to divorce him
[33:37] Although, all the neighbors say that you all tortured her. 
[33:44] She left the house bare feet to save her life
[33:50] Anyways, this incident is transparent. Otherwise, they wouldn't have fired him from job. 
[33:56] Now don't ask who told me this. Bride's brother went to Faraz's office and found it out
[34:05] and then they refused.
[34:25] sir, its injustice with Mr. Faraz
[34:28] Look, we also don't want anything wrong happens to anyone, neither with you nor with Mr. Faraz. 
[34:33] But you can see that company's reputation is suffering with you both
[34:39] Our competitors are taking advantage of this situation. Situation hasn't changed yet
[34:48] Yes, you must have an idea what is going on on social media
[34:53] I totally understand and I'm really sorry about this. 
[34:56] But sir, if my resignation solves this problem then I'm ready to resign
[35:03] but sir, Mr. Faraz is very needy. He needs this job. 
[35:09] You also know that he won't get another job in this situation
[35:13] You also know that this is a false blame. He isn't like this
[35:20] Please sir, do think about it. He's innocent. Trust me
[35:25] Fine Ms. Mahnoor. We have heard you. Give us some time to discuss this matter
[35:31] As far as your resignation is concerned, that's not possible. 
[35:36] Otherwise, it would confirm that Faraz is guilty and we asked the victim to leave
[35:42] which isn't true
[35:44] Yes, he said it right. And you know how quickly people make a story out of it
[35:57] okay sir, I'll leave
[36:00] Please, do give it a thought
[36:23] You ..
[36:26] You wait here for a minute
[36:28] where are you going?
[36:49] Maheer?
[36:52] Excuse me for a minute
[36:55] sure? Yes, speak?
[37:00] I wanted to talk about a lecture. That subject ..
[37:04] Please Ramsha, I'm not in a mood to teach you right now. 
[37:10] Come after a day or two. If I'm in mood, I'll teach you
[37:22] okay?
[37:23] Listen? Come
[37:27] come
[37:30] What happened? What is it?
[37:33] listen man ..
[37:35] Is this your bother Faraz?
[37:38] This story is on social media as well?
[37:41] Seriously? Did your brother really harass his boss
[37:44] No way, this girl is telling a lie. She is humiliating him
[37:49] seriously?
[37:50] She is characterless herself and now blaming my brother
[37:55] yes, you go
[37:57] we'll meet later
[38:00] yes
[38:25] Faraz my child ..
[38:29] Did you find a job?
[38:33] I will
[38:42] I don't understand
[38:44] what is life punishing me for? Earlier, I tolerated torture from my in laws
[38:56] I left my share behind just to avoid conflict
[39:02] I suffered
[39:06] faced poverty ..
[39:10] and today, my children are facing troubles like me
[39:20] O God
[39:24] if this was written in my fate
[39:31] then You should have written a good fate for my kids
[39:38] Mother, we shouldn't complaint
[39:41] We can't complaint to Him
[39:46] Then whom shall I complaint?
[39:49] who do I have than Him?
[39:53] infront of whom I can cry?
[40:05] People get their sons married
[40:11] for their happiness, but I brought a trouble into this house.
[40:20] that nuisance has caused you humiliation
[40:29] Mahnoor is worse than her. She took the job away
[40:35] I think ..
[40:38] like you, Aima won't get married too
[40:50] Mother, it isn't Mahnoor's fault
[40:54] Whose fault is it? Yours? Did you see this?
[41:04] Every other person in university is asking me that did your brother really harass that girl?
[41:12] what do I tell them ..
[41:14] Maheer?
