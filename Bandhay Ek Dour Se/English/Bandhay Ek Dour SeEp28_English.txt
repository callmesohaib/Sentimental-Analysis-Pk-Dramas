I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
To get a husband or in other words,
to get a man,
a person can pass any limit.
to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
for me, other things matter too,
like relations,
faithfulness,
trust,
and friendship.
And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
Umar is not just my husband,
he is also my childhood friend,
my partner since childhood
and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
You lied to him,
and that poor thing,
he didn’t lie, you did.
He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
I am back,
but not to get Umar,
but to save him.
Oh God, what will I reply to his questions?
I didn’t even think of an excuse,
how was I to know…
You now prepare to go home.
Thank God.
Here.
Mama is at home to give you company,
she cannot have this diet food alone.
Now you will have diet food
and she will too.
Its fine, right?
Yes.
Did Maheen make it?
I don’t know.
That’s fine.
You go and do your work,
Mansoor is here,
when you come back,
we will go home together.
Okay.
Thank you.
I have been asking you for so long,
let me shampoo your hair, brush it,
I finally had to force you.
You leave it, I will do it myself.
Not at all,
you will sit here peacefully,
I will make your hair, then uncle will come.
after that I have to go help out sister in law too.
I feel really bad,
that after Najia gave me such a big good news,
instead of me caring for her,
taking care of her wishes,
I am on the bed myself,
but these days you have really cared for Najia.
Now I am thinking,
when you leave, we will be in a tough spot.
So don’t make us get used to your comfort.
This…
I am not going.
I am not going anywhere.
How are you?
I will talk to you later.
Bye. Bye.
I am coming home.
Fine. Fine.
Yes Monis, come you can meet papa.
Oh,
no,
I didn’t come here to see how you care for me,
in fact, I will make tea for you and myself…
No, no, leave it. Keep sitting.
Even the doctor didn’t instruct me to sit so much.
What do you want?
I sit here and do nothing.
You  have to see mama too.
Yes, so I just have to see her,
what else do I have to do,
we have a maid,
there is a washing machine,
the home is cleaned,
I just have to take care of the kitchen
and that is not much work,
that is no work, if I don’t do that even,
then what is the benefit of me being here?
You only came here to benefit us?
No, there is another reason.
Umar?
I was going to the kitchen to make tea
and you got me talking here.
Maheen,
everything was fine between you and Umar,
at least it seemed ok.
Sister in law, just think I was being stupid,
I was going to get a big loss,
I listened to people and…
now I am back.
To fix everything and
by the will of God it will all be fine.
God willing.
Yes Monis,
tell me what is the important
thing you want to talk about?
I want to talk but
I wanted that we sit in front of each other
and talk face to face,
it will be nice.
Actually, I have to be somewhere,
there is something important.
I think those days were more important 
where the new relation was not formed.
We were friends,
brothers too,
we didn’t have this formality between us.
The new relation changes everything, no?
Nothing like that Monis, actually papa…
Fine, I will meet you.
Tell me, where do you want me to come?
Get two cups of tea my friend.
Look man,
I should have talked about this to Maheen.
One minute.
One minute, man.
How did you call me here?
Talking to old friendship.
Now you are talking about Maheen,
you are trying to make me realize
and you are telling me
the type of relation we are in?
Thank you, man.
Okay,
think that,
here,
I didn’t call you to talk about your wife,
but my sister.
Okay?
Look, I have never forced her before today
that she comes back
and nor have I pressurized you,
and I don’t even know
who was at fault from between you two.
Now I get it,
what you have come to talk to me about.
Hey, man, I am not talking about this.
Then?
I wanted to talk about Roshni.
Roshni, tell me the complete thing.
Tell me what happened?
Open the door.
Roshni.
Come here.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Sit here.
What happened?
What was the need to go tell all those things?
You have  any idea,
you got me insulted badly.
How was I to know?
I thought she was your best friend,
you must have told her
something from the start.
Mama,
I am not interested in ridiculing 
myself in front of the world.
That is why I don’t tell her everything.
You have this habit of taking me lightly.
Oh God,
you are shouting like,
all hell has broken loose.
Fine, I made a mistake,
I ask for forgiveness,
I will not even think of this even
when I am alone.
Where this thing had to reach,
it has reached.
Meaning?
Even if Maheen has found out about you,
then, what is wrong in that?
She is your best friend.
What is respect and
disrespect between friends?
She will not tell anyone.
You just forget it.
Why won’t she tell anyone anything?
She will first go and tell Umar.
Mama, you have ruined
my well planned out game.
What well planned out game?
And what is Umar?
You tell me,
no matter what happens in your life,
who is Umar?
Roshni,
what are you hiding from me?
tell me.
Why are you mentioning
Umar again and again.
Mama, you go from here,
you leave me alone, go from here.
Roshni.
Go!
Roshni?
Yes,
she went to your home today
and I don’t like this.
She must have gone to meet Maheen,
so what?
This is what I don’t want.
Look Umar,
because of this Roshni’s stupidity,
both families had bitterness.
You two were upset with each other, right?
Its possible you two must have
had an argument on something.
Maybe this issue would
have been sorted before time,
had Roshni not added fuel to the fire.
There wouldn’t have been
so many complaints.
What?
I don’t get it, what did Roshni do?
So, Maheen told you nothing till now?
Umar,
Maheen didn’t say
all those things to mama,
the weird complaints about you,
uncle and aunt.
Roshni did that.
Mama thought that Maheen must have been
reducing the burden on her heart,
so as soon as aunt came in front,
she complained.
Then things got out of hand.
Maheen fought a lot with
mama on saying all these things,
especially when nothing like this happened.
That’s when we found out.
Maheen said nothing like this?
No,
in fact, she fought with mama,
she got upset.
She was swearing that
those people care for me so much,
they love me a lot.
So,
I was just thinking that
Roshni doesn’t meet Maheen again.
I don’t know why she did this.
So I am just afraid
that she might do this again.
So instead of me talking to Maheen,
its better that
you tell her clearly that
there is no need to meet Roshni again,
or meet less.
This is best for you two.
Okay?
Okay.
Najia.
Najia.
Papa is home.
Hello papa.
How are you now papa?
Hello papa.
Medicines?
Yes, they are in the car, I will get them.
Till then I will drop papa to the bedroom.
Fine.
Come on, there is work in the kitchen.
I am happy that you are home,
but I am sad that
I am not capable of caring for you.
That’s it.
We have cared enough for each other.
Its time for the kids now,
they will care for us now.
Why not papa? Surely.
He will do that when he gets
time caring for his wife, then.
Congratulations papa, mama is fine.
I was thinking mama lost her
memory after the accident,
she must have forgotten that
I am a mother in law.
Here, she remembers that
I am a hen pecked husband.
Stop it son, stop it.
Okay,
Mansoor,
I asked you for some work of Umar,
did you talk to him?
I will talk in a day or two.
About what?
Hey, leave it.
That reminds me papa,
what were you singing in the happiness
of mama regaining her memory.
Talking is…
Yes, what is Razia?
Talking for me is….
Mr. Mehdi Hasan Khan.
Let me try.
It wasn’t this difficult for me to talk earlier.
Wow.
Just like now…
Just like my gathering is now,
it wasn’t like this earlier.
Yes,
just like your gathering is right now,
it was not before.
Umar, Maheen didn’t
say all those things to mama,
the weird complaints about you,
uncle and aunt.
Roshni did that.
Mama thought that Maheen must have been
reducing the burden on her heart,
so as soon as aunt came in front,
she complained.
Then things got out of hand.
Maheen fought a lot with mama
on saying all these things,
especially when nothing like this happened.
That’s when we found out.
Maheen said nothing like this?
No,
in fact, she fought with mama,
she got upset.
She was swearing that
those people care for me so much,
they love me a lot.
Hey stop it, Maheen.
I cannot digest anything lying on the bed and
you feed me after every thirty minutes.
Uncle, tell her,
till she doesn’t eat,
how will she regain health
and how will she get fine.
You go without worrying, you rest.
I will see her, go.
I am not going anywhere,
since I have come,
I am sleeping here with aunt.
Hey child, your uncle is back, he is here.
You go sleep in your room, come on.
Now the duty is double now,
I have to care for you and uncle too.
I am sleeping here on the sofa.
No, Maheen, what are you doing?
No, Maheen, child…
I will go change and come.
Stay happy child, stay happy.
Maheen.
Sit here.
I want to talk to you about something,
I want to say something.
I also want to talk to you.
I don’t know if you will believe me or not.
I don’t know if you will believe me or not.
When your belief is so weak,
should you talk?
I think, yes.
If saying it has chances of loss,
then not saying it will bring
a much bigger chance of loss.
So say it.
I shouldn’t have gotten angry with you.
Not at all.
And when I realized
that my anger is baseless,
I felt really embarrassed.
Really really embarrassed.
Maheen, will you forgive me?
Anger for what?
Maheen, when you left from here,
I was really surprised.
I thought Maheen left
all of a sudden like this,
how?
I got really worried.
I felt that everyone in the home will blame me,
what will I say to everyone?
What will I tell them?
To be honest,
I didn’t feel angry at all.
I thought it was your
right to think about yourself,
decide for yourself.
Honestly,
this was your right,
but when I found out that you,
you said all this about mama and papa…
Umar,
I did not….
One minute Maheen, let me say it.
One minute.
If you had told everyone that
Umar is with someone even after marriage
or even this truth of yours
wouldn’t have hurt me,
had you set you don’t like
being together with me,
that was fine too.
But saying something about mama
and papa and things like these,
after that I was completely broken.
But Maheen, then I found out that
you didn’t say any of this.
I swear to God I am so embarrassed,
I don’t have words.
How did I even think, that my Maheen,
my childhood friend,
my best friend,
will say this about my parents,
or about me, how did I even believe it?
I mean…
that is what I am embarrassed about.
really embarrassed.
The way Maheen has cared for us,
if we had our own daughter,
she wouldn’t even be able to do it.
This means you have
cleaned your heart from her.
After so much love and care,
even a stone melts,
I am still human.
You know,
there is one thing Fareed,
after so many days have passed,
Maheen hasn’t mentioned why she went
and what her fight with Umar was for.
She didn’t even justify her lie,
nor did she apologize for it.
What better way for apologizing
than her coming back,
she realized it,
she made a mistake.
What do you think,
do you only apologize with your tongue?
But,
did you note something Razia,
that is everything normal
between Umar and Maheen?
You have asked this question,
so even after thinking too hard,
I don’t remember whether the two of them
have even talked to each other even.
Oh God,
my doubt was right.
What doubt?
She didn’t come back
ending her anger with Umar,
she came back to her blood relatives,
maybe for sympathy.
But Umar doesn’t have either of
the two reasons to come back to Maheen.
You know Razia,
whenever I have mentioned
Maheen in front of Umar,
I have seen a weird fear on his face.
Always.
Leave it,
what are you thinking right now,
they are kids.
Everything will be fine with time.
Time doesn’t pass,
it leaps forward.
What is the point of realizing this later,
when you spend so many years
in deprivation and compromise?
What is the point of the realization then?
Razia,
we mistreated our children a lot.
We have really mistreated them.
Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
So you know this is Roshni’s action
Obviously I know, man.
I am so stupid, so idiotic,
how did I believe that you said all this.
My Maheen cannot do this?
You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
I know this.
And most importantly,
you can never stain our friendship,
not today, nor tomorrow.
Friendship?
Yes, friendship.
So, you know why Roshni said all this?
Yes,
I know it really well.
I know you and her well.
You are my friend,
and she is my love.
You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
She is really stupid.
You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
Poor thing,
she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
She did all this for your ease,
when she realized that
you won’t be able to say anything in any way,
so she said it,
for your ease.
Think about it.
For my ease?
Yes,
now she is not even answering her phone.
I have been trying her phone for so long.
Since she found out
that you have come back,
since then.
She wants to get out from between us,
so that we stay happy.
She is so stupid.
She loves me after all,
she is trying to live up to it.
This is a weird situation.
What happened?
You didn’t get it?
Maheen?
Aunt is waiting for me.
Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
So you know this is Roshni’s action?
Obviously I know, man.
I am so stupid, so idiotic,
how did I believe that you said all this.
My Maheen cannot do this?
You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
I know this.
And most importantly,
you can never stain our friendship,
not today, nor tomorrow.
I know you and her well.
You are my friend,
and she is my love.
You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
She is really stupid.
You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
Poor thing,
she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
She did all this for your ease,
when she realized that
you won’t be able
to say anything in any way,
so she said it,
for your ease.
Think about it.
