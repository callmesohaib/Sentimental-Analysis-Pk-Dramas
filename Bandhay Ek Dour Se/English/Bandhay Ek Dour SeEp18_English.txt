I will go but whenever I go to aunt’s
I come back with a heavy heart.
There is no one to care for her in her illness.
She has become really alone after uncle.
Yes,
and then God didn’t give her a child even.
Oh God. My poor sister,
all her life she lived a tough life.
She got insulted for not having
a child from her in laws and then
the husband often threatened her
of second marriage
and now she is lonely.
What happened?
Nothing,
just thought of sister in law.
Poor thing.
At least brother Mansoor is good,
he doesn’t curse her or give her threats
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
That’s it, it’s fine.
No,
aunt I didn’t mean that.
Aunt it’s my habit,
I say things without thinking.
Please don’t mind, I didn’t mean that.
The massage is done.
No…
aunt I wasn’t even thinking this.
Mad.
Mama is right, I am dumb.
I don’t know how long she will stay upset for.
What did you say to Maheen
that she is ready to do all this.
I didn’t say anything,
she was saying big dialogues.
I am generous,
I am a sacrificial Godess,
she even said that you can keep Umar,
it doesn’t matter to her.
She said that?
Wl yes, so?
When a married woman tells another woman
that she has no relation with her husband,
what does that mean?
It means one thing.
That is what I am trying to tell you Roshni,
both of us have no such feelings between us,
that married couples have.
What girl would say that?
See, she is telling me that I accept you,
marry you.
Not just marriage,
she is giving you two options.
Either marry me, or leave me.
She knows well that
you won’t go for the first option,
so what is the second option?
To leave me.
Its not like that Roshni,
she must have said this with full sincerity.
Then why don’t you do one thing,
worship her sincerity.
Cause you don’t care or need my love.
You are happy with generosity.
No Roshni, what can be a bigger need than love.
You don’t compare yourself to
Maheen again and again,
it hurts.
It hurts me too,
because I am far behind in conception with her.
Tell me, will you marry me?
No right?
Then accept her second condition and leave me?
She didn’t put a condition, she gave a suggestion,
I have the right to decide.
I will decide on my own.
Roshni, I will marry you,
I will talk to my family.
But not right now,
after a while.
Okay, and after that?
What after that?
will your family agree?
Maheen is your uncle’s daughter,
the whole family will turn against you.
What will you do? Leave home?
Okay,
for a second, let’s believe you leave home,
but after that?
where will you take me?
You don’t have a job,
you handle your father’s business
and he will not give the whole business to
you out of this happiness and my mother,
why would she marry me to you?
A man who is already married,
and doesn’t even have a job?
What do I do, Roshni?
Right now I cannot suddenly convince them,
I can only talk.
Yes, you will talk and then forget for sure.
Look,
it will be fin,
when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
and accept that they made a mistake
and they themselves say that Umar,
marry where you want to.
It will work then.
Roshni, what cannot happen,
Maheen wants that,
you are saying the same thing.
A lot can happen if your goddess
of sacrifice is really willing to sacrifice.
My poor sister,
all her life she lived a tough life.
She got insulted for not having
 a child from her in laws and then
the husband often threatened 
her of second marriage
At least brother Mansoor is good,
he doesn’t curse her or give her threats 
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
Where is mama?
She went to elder aunt’s home,
she is unwell.
Why do you have a long face?
I have always had a long face.
Yes, I know you have a long face, 
but today, its longer than normal.
You too have a long face all the time, 
have I ever asked you the reason?
Ask,
Listen Maheen,
what you said last night,
I thought hard about it.
Its really difficult,
in fact, impossible
and I am not afraid of papa scolding me,
nor mama’s slaps or curses,
I will face that.
But all this is not possible,
there is no benefit in it.
The battle I can’t win,
why should I fight it.
I am talking to you.
I shouldn’t have spoken to aunt like this,
she thinks I was sarcastic towards her. 
How can I be sarcastic?
I swear to God Umar,
I didn’t think something like that and
 it slipped my tongue and she disliked it so much,
she is unwell and her heart is dirty towards me.
This is why you are worried?
Yes.
Okay, you do one thing,
when you talk to her,
 tell her that I was really embarrassed.
I am.
Curse your birth Roshni,
you have not left me capable 
to show my face anywhere.
You got me insulted in the community.
Mama,
what did I do? What is my fault in this?
All this happened with me,
you should be sympathetic towards me.
Why should I be sympathetic?
About what should I be sympathetic?
Did you told me earlier?
You should have told me all this earlier,
I would have at least gone and slapped Shahista
about how she even thought of making you a servant.
Hey, they have some money out of illegal means, 
she will consider her relatives small.
You know, what the real issue is?
You are shameless.
You suffered through all this,
 how did you go through this insult.
Now I don’t understand 
what those people will think about us,
how we have stayed quiet.
Mama, had I told you all this, 
I would have been the one that got insulted.
Hey, you should have told me something,
at least I wouldn’t have been sarcastic towards
 his son getting married somewhere else.
I would said it myself
that you were disillusioned
that they were taking you not to make you 
their daughter in law, but servant.
God knows what she will be telling everyone.
Mama.
Mama,
you don’t realize 
how I went through all this, how I felt?
You know, only out of the fear 
that I don’t hurt you,
I suffered this sorrow alone.
I used to hide and cry at night,
so that you don’t cry.
Instead of being sympathetic towards me, 
you are getting upset with me.
You know,
a little money has removed
 the shame from Shahista’s eyes.
What was the need for you to
 make a mansion out of dreams,
you thought yourself…
okay stop it.
leave it,
what had to happen, happened.
Come here to me.
Be quiet.
May God ask these mother and son.
Yeah.
You really care for your mother today.
I always care for you.
You were telling me about aunt, how is she?
Yes, she is better.
The sorrow of loneliness is the biggest on her,
its eating sister alive.
You are right.
It will be fun,
when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
and they accept they made a mistake.
Maheen misbehaved with you?
Huh?
How dare she?
So much courage to misbehave with my mother?
I would have fixed her right there,
but papa is there,
she is papa’s beloved,
he would have scolded me 
instead so I said nothing,
but you don’t have to care for her,
you need to scold her 
or she will get on your head.
Get lost,
Get up from here. Bloody conspirator.
What is wrong mama?
You sat with your grandma since childhood, 
this is what you had to learn.
Instigating people.
Hey, I am saying it for you.
Get lost from here, 
or else I will hit you with my slipper!
Have you no shame doing 
this cunningness and back biting.
Hey, does this cunningness suit a man.
Hey, there is no point in 
being good in these times.
Hey careful.
Now I get it why he was so passionate 
about caring for his mother.
You have been lying here since last night?
Why do you care?
Why are you angry?
Why do you care?
Did you fight with Roshni?
Why do you care?
Yeah,
why do I care.
Listen,
what did you say to mama?
Why do you care?
Okay, sorry.
About what?
I won’t tell you that.
Listen,
should I take you to aunt today, it’s a holiday.
No, not cause of that, I swear.
I will drop you and leave from outside.
Tell me.
We will go together.
I will go ask aunt.
Mama, do you have a complain?
What have you people thought?
Will you take a step or not?
Regarding what?
God also helps those who make a move.
Whatever you get is from God, 
but a person needs to do something.
The time is passing and 
this task will get difficult.
After all, there is an age to have 
a child and bringing it up.
Will you two realize after you turn 40?
I knew it,
mama wanted to say this
and wanted to say it with us sitting in front of her.
Hey…
Najia, sit here,
and you will not move till I complete.
Hear me clearly.
I went to elder aunt tomorrow
and I couldn’t see her condition,
everyone gets old and gets unwell,
but may God not give anyone 
the sorrow of loneliness.
I know well,
that her mother in law used 
to go after holy water,
and these religious scholars.
If sister was treated on time,
God would have given her a child,
but no.
now science has progressed so much, 
there are great doctors,
why don’t you people get yourself treated?
What do you think?
That we didn’t go to doctors?
Mama,
Najia,
I mean got her tests done from 2-3 places,
her reports are normal, there is no issue.
And you?
Did you get your tests done?
What?
What do you mean mama?
What are you saying?
Your papa always said that brother Ghulam Rasool,
who has been threatening sister
 for years about a second marriage,
why doesn’t he get married again?
It was only cause if they don’t have 
a child from the second wife either,
everything would become clear.
That he has the issue not sister.
Now God knows what the reality is,
when God kept the secret of the one who died, 
then why should we look into it.
But Mansoor,
I don’t want that people have 
the same opinion about you,
so son, get your tests done as soon as possible.
Yes.
Najia,
even your mother must wish to see you bear a child,
this is something natural.
If this doesn’t upset you, 
then don’t get upset when I say it.
Child, I want to see you happy,
and settled, that is it.
If I had not seen you, 
then you were dropping her and going back.
You yourself said you don’t like meeting here.
Aww,
you listen to so much I say,
you are so good.
You brought her here stuck to each other,
how were you two sitting on the bike,
 stuck to each other.
How else do you sit on the bike?
It’s a holiday,
everyone wants to go out,
the car was not there, so I came on the bike.
Ok, please leave these complaints,
I am already worried.
What happened now?
What you said is going on in my head,
that she is making 
a place in the heart of the family
and when it will be time for me to demand something, 
everyone will take her side.
Last night I found the opportunity, 
regarding Maheen….
What?
What did you do? Tell me.
Why are you not talking? Speak up!
Calm down Roshni, what is wrong?
I am telling you.
I am listening, you speak up.
I was talking to mama about her, 
I bad mouthed her in front of her,
and she scolded me.
She said, what, why, 
why am I acting like a woman?
Thank God.
I thought God knows what happened.
Monis.
Monis.
Yes. Yes.
Come here.
Yes mama.
Call them, I am fixing food.
What is she doing upstairs since then?
Roshni came, 
she took her to the roof and sat there.
It feels like she came to
 meet her friend and not her mother.
Umar is also upstairs since then. 
What would Umar do between them?
I will see.
Umar, come down, 
the food is getting cold.
My phone.
Come on.
Listen,
have food and go.
Mahi, ask your friend to stay.
No, I just had to meet, I did.
 I have a full stomach now, I will go.
Hey, where are you going? Have food.
No, I will eat later. I will leave now.
You sit, you eat food at least.
I will go, bye.
Get tea now Monis, you take a century.
I got it mama, I got it.
Give it.
Which one is mine.
This.
This?
Yes, this.
I will marry Fazeela and bring her home soon.
Did you talk to Maheen? 
Did you ask her something?
Umar was with her, how could I talk?
How could I ask her
 if her mother in law is bothering her?
Something else is bothering me mama.
This Mahi was treating Roshni in a weird manner,
all stuck up and Roshni too was upset with her too,
like there was an issue between them.
Instead of me worrying about
 if my daughter’s mother in law is bothering her,
is the sister in law cunning or not, 
if Umar is treating her right or not,
I should worry about her friend?
This happens.
She is married, and after marriage,
friendships you made when you are
 single don’t stay the same.
Still mama, there is something
 that I don’t understand, but I feel.
Najia, I am getting late, come fast.
I am here. I am here, I am ready.
Mansoor.
Yeah?
Will you come soon from work?
Yes, I will. Is there some work?
Yes, we have to go to the doctor.
We will see...
Yeah, but mama asked us.
Before this you never took 
anything mama said seriously,
now you are in a hurry.
Come quick, I am waiting in the car.
Mansoor…
Umar.
You ironed it yourself, I would have ironed it.
Its fine, its done now.
Okay, I am going to make breakfast,
 what will you have?
Should I make you flat bread?
No, mama will make it.
Why?
No, cause she makes my breakfast.
Yes, but I make it now.
Umar, what happened?
Are you upset with me?
That is why you are not letting me do your work?
What happened?
No Maheen, I am not upset,
I just realized that
since we both don’t believe this relation,
then why do you have to do my work?
Me, as a husband, don’t fulfill my rights,
 then its not your duty to do all this.
My work is not your duty, don’t do it.
Where did this rights and 
duties discussion come from, Umar?
I am me,
we are not strangers for each other.
 I am still Maheen.
I know you are still that Maheen, 
and you are the same Umar.
And Maheen I want that you stay 
the same Maheen and I stay the same Umar.
I don’t want to make you work,
I don’t want to make you and 
I realize that you are my wife.
Where did this rights and 
duties discussion come from, Umar?
I am me,
we are not strangers for each other. 
I am still Maheen.
Maheen I want that you stay
 the same Maheen and I stay the same Umar.
I don’t want to make you work,
I don’t want to make you and
 I realize that you are my wife.
Maheen.
Here, keep this.
What is this?
Papa, reminded me that 
I should give you pocket money.
Pocket Money!
Its written in the wedding papers,
pocket money.
So?
Why should I take it from you?
Papa asked me.
Umar, you reminded me this morning 
that you are that same Umar
and you want to stay
that way and I am that old Maheen 
and I should stay that way.
We shouldn’t make each other realize
 that we have the same relation.
You don’t have any right towards me, 
nor do I have any duties.
So then how can I take this 
money as my right?
You are scared of making me do your 
work you will feel I am your wife,
then how will I not consider you my husband 
when I take pocket money from you?
I don’t want anything from you.
Roshni,
why don’t you come to your senses?
Look in our homes, 
we will get proposal for people like us.
You just suffered at the hands of Shahista just now.
When am I saying I want to marry a billionaire.
Okay,
then who do you want to marry?
Roshni, I am your mother,
 tell me clearly who do you like?
Mama, the one I would love, 
I won’t marry him either.
You are out of your mind.
My mind is working fine, in fact perfect!
You should marry someone who loves you.
Mama, there are two things in this world, 
a lot of money or a lot of love.
Either marry me to someone rich,
or someone who loves me so much that 
he will keep the world at the tip of his shoes for me.
Wow.
This is a new scheme that has been born?
Mama,
I am telling you,
if you marry me someone 
who doesn’t appreciate me,
I will not come and beg you, 
I will make your life hell.
My love,
you have already done that, 
you are not giving me any comfort.
Umar, what happened? 
Why are you not having breakfast?
Everyone has had breakfast and left, 
and you are not even eating.
Grandma, I don’t feel like it.
Why? What happened?
Grandma, tea.
No, I don’t want to have it right now,
I have to take my medication first.
In fact, do one thing, 
get tea to my room, I will have it there.
You should have had breakfast at least,
aunt made it, not me.
I made tea, don’t have it.
Its not that Maheen,
that money was given by papa,
you can keep it.
Fine,
then ask uncle to give the money to me himself.
What sort of stubbornness is this Maheen?
 How will it work like that?
You started it Umar,
if you think getting your work 
done is showing your right,
then why should I show my right on you?
Hello mama.
Hello, you are back.
You took so long today?
I stopped at mama’s for a while on my way back.
You just don’t do what I told you to,
 you just visit your mother.
If your mother had said the same thing, 
you would never ignored it.
I still wouldn’t be able to do mama,
because your son has to go,
its up to him, if he goes or doesn’t go.
God forbid if my mother had said this,
Mansoor would have wrecked a havoc,
that how dare my mother say this.
Grandma.
Yes?
Here you go.
What happened? You just left like that.
Nothing like that,
but tell me,
what is the planning going on between 
the one who lives upstairs and Razia?
Who is the one who lives upstairs?
Najia.
Day before yesterday,
both husband and wife were sitting 
in Razia’s room for an hour.
The door was locked yesterday too.
Today she came to see her 
as soon as she came from school.
I don’t know grandma, 
she must have gone to say hello.
Leave it, she is not that obedient.
And you,
you wear these two dresses, you take one off, 
wear the other, don’t you have any other clothes?
Grandma,
all the clothes are so heavy, 
with a lot of embroidery,
how can I wear them at home,
there are just a couple of light dresses, 
I wear them.
Yes, that is right,
the clothes in dowry are heavy,
 to wear when you go out.
But you have been married for 2 months,
 didn’t Umar get you other clothes?
Let him come,
I will teach him a lesson and this Razia, 
she doesn’t realize this?
If she tells Umar, he will listen,
he follows Razia’s orders.
And you too, you are sitting quietly, 
why don’t you ask Umar yourself?
No grandma,
I didn’t feel the need so I said nothing, 
you too please don’t say anything to Umar.
Why don’t I say anything? 
I will surely tell him.
Yes!
