Roshni,
why don’t you come to your senses?
Look in our homes,
we will get proposal for people like us.
You just suffered at the hands of Shahista just now.
When am I saying I want to marry a billionaire.
Okay,
then who do you want to marry?
Roshni, I am your mother,
tell me clearly who do you like?
Mama, the one I would love,
I won’t marry him either.
You are out of your mind.
My mind is working fine, in fact perfect!
You should marry someone who loves you.
Mama, there are two things in this world,
a lot of money or a lot of love.
Either marry me to someone rich,
or someone who loves me so much that
he will keep the world at the tip of his shoes for me.
Wow.
This is a new scheme that has been born?
Mama,
I am telling you,
if you marry me someone
who doesn’t appreciate me,
I will not come and beg you,
I will make your life hell.
My love,
you have already done that,
you are not giving me any comfort.
Umar, what happened?
Why are you not having breakfast?
Everyone has had breakfast and left,
and you are not even eating.
Grandma, I don’t feel like it.
Why? What happened?
Grandma, tea.
No, I don’t want to have it right now,
I have to take my medication first.
In fact, do one thing,
get tea to my room, I will have it there.
You should have had breakfast at least,
aunt made it, not me.
I made tea, don’t have it.
Its not that Maheen,
that money was given by papa,
you can keep it.
Fine,
then ask uncle to give the money to me himself.
What sort of stubbornness is this Maheen?
How will it work like that?
You started it Umar,
if you think getting your work
done is showing your right,
then why should I show my right on you?
Hello mama.
Hello, you are back.
You took so long today?
I stopped at mama’s for a while on my way back.
You just don’t do what I told you to,
you just visit your mother.
If your mother had said the same thing,
you would never ignored it.
I still wouldn’t be able to do mama,
because your son has to go,
its up to him, if he goes or doesn’t go.
God forbid if my mother had said this,
Mansoor would have wrecked a havoc,
that how dare my mother say this.
Grandma.
Yes?
Here you go.
What happened? You just left like that.
Nothing like that,
but tell me,
what is the planning going on between
the one who lives upstairs and Razia?
Who is the one who lives upstairs?
Najia.
Day before yesterday,
both husband and wife were sitting
in Razia’s room for an hour.
The door was locked yesterday too.
Today she came to see her
as soon as she came from school.
I don’t know grandma,
she must have gone to say hello.
Leave it, she is not that obedient.
And you,
you wear these two dresses, you take one off,
wear the other, don’t you have any other clothes?
Grandma,
all the clothes are so heavy,
with a lot of embroidery,
how can I wear them at home,
there are just a couple of light dresses,
I wear them.
Yes, that is right,
the clothes in dowry are heavy,
to wear when you go out.
But you have been married for 2 months,
didn’t Umar get you other clothes?
Let him come,
I will teach him a lesson and this Razia,
she doesn’t realize this?
If she tells Umar, he will listen,
he follows Razia’s orders.
And you too, you are sitting quietly,
why don’t you ask Umar yourself?
No grandma,
I didn’t feel the need so I said nothing,
you too please don’t say anything to Umar.
Why don’t I say anything?
I will surely tell him.
Yes!
Is it done?
Or is there something left?
What?
I lied at home, took such a big risk
that I am coming to meet you
and you are telling me
 the problems of your married life.
If you want a suggestion, 
take it from her too.
Roshni, you too are being sarcastic.
I am saying to you what is in my heart,
who else do I share it with?
You say all that is in your 
heart to your childhood friend.
As per you, 
she is still your best friend.
Hey no,
in fact, that cannot happen either. 
She is the biggest issue of your life.
That poor thing is not an issue.
You stop calling her a poor thing.
I agree this wedding 
didn’t happen cause of her,
I also agree that 
she didn’t try to come between us,
but she did come and 
she is standing her ground,
then why does she make you
feel guilty again and again?
No,
everything was going fine, 
I talked about my right, just like that…
You married her,
she lives with you in that home,
 in your room.
When you want,
you can leave that home 
and come meet me.
I have so much pressure from my family,
I get proposals daily.
You don’t let me live, 
nor give me permission to die.
I don’t understand how all 
this is so easy for you, Umar.
You are a selfish man, nothing else.
Roshni.
Roshni.
Roshni, where are you going?
Wait.
Roshni.
Auto.
Where are you going? 
I will drop you.
I came alone, I will go alone.
You go to your queen and 
take care of her tantrums.
Roshni, listen…
No, do one thing,
next time bring her along,
so that the poor thing can go
around with us, enjoy a little.
Roshni. Roshni.
Roshni, listen to me, what is this?
Maheen.
Maheen.
Yes aunt.
Zakia called.
Mama?
Yes.
If you wanted something you 
should have told me or Umar,
why did you want to mention it to your mother?
Mama, I didn’t say anything to mama.
Okay. Okay. Don’t start crying.
I am not scolding you 
for what you said to whom,
I am scolding you because mama is a jukebox,
 a complete jukebox.
She called Zakia immediately, 
and you know what she said?
What?
That we don’t care about your needs 
and she has married her daughter,
thrown her, has forgotten.
She should at least realize what you need, 
what you don’t need.
See now, she got us insulted.
No aunt,
even mama knows grandma’s habits,
 she won’t mind.
Look Maheen,
you be careful when talking to mama,
with her increasing age, 
she is unable to understand
and she doesn’t leave a chance 
to take out her anger on me.
Now tell me,
Zakia is not just my sister in law,
in fact she is also now my son’s mother in law.
What respect will I have left in front of her?
Ok, go over with Umar tomorrow,
if he delays or makes excuses,
 let me know I will take you there.
Child, If you don’t mention your needs
 to your husband, then who will you ask?
Okay come on, work now.
Mama, has Maheen come?
No, did she have to come?
I saw Umar near the park,
I thought he would be dropping 
Maheen and going back.
Then they will properly come?
No mama, I saw him an hour back.
He was alone,
I thought he would be going back.
If he didn’t come here,
then what was he doing there?
Hey, he must have come with some work,
men have a 1000 things to do
and since he has been married,
he has become serious and become responsible.
He is working hard.
Maheen is lucky.
Yes, you are right,
but I don’t know there is something 
that keeps on bothering me.
Its your sister’s love,
 that keeps you restless
or else Maheen couldn’t get
 better in-laws than that home.
I have ironed all your shirts,
should I make you tea?
Umar,
I have found a solution for 
what you talked to me about.
You will not feel that it is your right as a husband
when I do your work and
I will not feel that I am taking
 money from you as a wife.
You give me that money for 
the work that I do,
and I will think I am taking 
that money for the work that I do.
Its not that I need money,
actually,
you were right.
How long will this go on for?
The family will ask and there will be questions,
so to save ourselves from all this,
I have found this solution.
I have been here for 4 hours,
he didn’t send me a single message,
nor did he bother saying sorry.
Why?
Why can’t I say this?
I am not illiterate, I know it all.
Yes, but I didn’t know that you could think
 like this for Najia and Mansoor.
God knows my intentions,
but these people have not cared about me.
Najia misbehaved with me even today,
think for their best and get insulted.
Its ok, you gave them 
a good suggestion to them,
that’s fine.
Yes, and Mahi put this in my head.
Mahi?
Since when did she become so smart?
Not smart,
she said it out of her naivety, 
but it touched my heart.
You know Mr. Fareed, 
can I tell you something,
for the first time in my life, 
I have not thought like a mother or a mother in law,
I thought like a woman.
I felt Najia’s pain,
that is why I spoke to Mansoor,
but obviously I cannot be more open.
You have to force him.
Yes Razia,
I will find the right moment and talk to him.
Fine.
I will see,
how long will you be able to stop yourself,
I will not call.
You will come after me yourself.
How do I call you?
What do I say?
Then you will again say
 I am traveling in two boats.
Umar.
You…
you went to meet Roshni,
in the park near our home?
You are spying on me, Maheen?
No,
you give everyone a chance yourself.
Brother Monis saw you, he called.
Did he see me with Roshni?
He was surprised 
what you were doing there at that time.
I made an excuse you had some work there.
Umar, don’t do this.
Do not do what?
Do I stop meeting her?
Stop talking to her?
This will never happen Maheen,
and its not cause 
I cannot live without meeting her,
but because if I don’t meet her,
that poor thing will die.
You have seen her condition,
what have I done to her?
I have hurt her a lot,
after hurting her I don’t even console her?
Leave her to cry and mourn?
No, I am not saying that.
Then what are you saying Maheen?
Say it.
Be sarcastic towards me.
That being married, I have a lover,
I am doing wrong with you and 
I am doing wrong with her too.
I am mistreating two girls, say it.
It is all my fault.
I am bad.
See how Fareed has forced you into work,
you go in the morning, come back late at night.
Now see, you two are children,
you two must want to go out, for outing.
You don’t worry son,
I will talk to Fareed.
Grandma, you don’t talk, please.
Why?
All the burden will fall on him.
I will talk to him myself. I will come early.
Anyway, you will have to come early today,
I have even told your father.
Why?
What is so special today?
Take Maheen to the market, take her shopping.
What is wrong mama? Is she a child?
She will go herself.
What problem do you have taking her?
Now see yourself mama,
I am saying it but he is making excuses.
Then you will blame me for everything 
that I didn’t let him go.
Let him not go, you don’t go either.
I am here.
I am her grandma,
she is a sign of my child,
I will take her to the market myself.
Yes, Yes.
We are not related to her,
you are the only well wisher of her,
or else everyone in 
the in-laws will eat her alive.
Yes, what else?
If it was in your hands,
you would treat her the same way
 that you treated Najia.
I am here,
or else she would be in a similar condition as Najia.
Yes, yes, mama, you are…
Oh come on, the two of you stop your firing.
You are always arguing.
Tell her to be ready by 5 pm.
Roshni,
your aunt is here,
go sit with her.
I just met her, its not been ages.
Listen, she has to go to 
the market to get a frock for Munni,
you go with her.
Can she not go yourself?
Okay,
you usually are unable to stay home,
now you have to go with your aunt,
 you are having a problem.
You run around doing Maheen’s work.
Today one of your own asked you,
you are in so much pain?
Roshni.
You wont go, right?
Don’t go.
Sit in your room.
I will have to go.
My joints hurt too.
But no one cares.
Go!
Why is he not messaging me after all?
I feel that cunning Maheen 
instigated him against me.
I will do something to him that 
he will remember all his life.
Man, you are standing here like
 this is the first time you failed.
You should be in practice.
Mama said if I fail once more
 she wont let me study further.
She will make me stay home.
Wow!
You are free!
Celebrate it!
Its going to be fun.
What fun?
I wanted to be something.
What?
Something big.
For example, engineer,
doctor,
scientist,
some surgeon
or you wanted to go to NASA? 
What did you want to do.
Be quiet Umar.
Okay listen. Listen to me.
You don’t know the table for 5,
what was that essay?
My favorite cousin,
you cannot write it.
How will you become an engineer or doctor?
I cannot write it cause 
I don’t have a favorite cousin.
Oh.
And,
if not an engineer or doctor, 
I would have completed my BA.
I would have become a teacher somewhere.
There is a job, you can do it.
You know it doesn’t require a degree, 
but hard work.
There is greatness in hard work.
I want to earn my own money,
 I don’t want to be a burden.
Yes, madam great will you do the job?
Yes.
You sure.
Yes.
Promise?
I don’t want to be a burden on anyone, tell me.
So, then do a job in someone’s home, 
a maid, become a maid.
You look like a maid.
What is wrong? Why are you hitting me?
Hey. Come on my horse.
Umar!
Look, my first earning,
I washed your clothes, ironed
then and got money for making tea and breakfast.
Fine, there is nothing wrong in this.
I know papa,
I am not saying no.
Then why are you delaying it?
Are you scared?
Look Mansoor, there is no point in delaying the reality.
Look, your reports will provide clarity on the treatment,
who needs the treatment.
It will all be fine, by the will of God.
God will be kind.
And if we get a report that
this treatment is not possible,
then?
Then at least,
Najia will be protected from the curses 
from your mother and other people.
What she has no fault in, 
why should she be punished for it.
There is a benefit in both cases,
one has your benefit,
one has Najia’s.
Have tea, its getting cold.
Look, I got such a pretty suit for you.
Wow.
Its good, right?
Hey look, I forgot to tell you.
You know who I saw today,
Maheen and Umar.
Hey, they looked so good together, 
they were enjoying themselves.
You know Maheen had so much stuff in her hands,
what do I say now, but by the grace of God,
you know I feel Umar spends openly,
he got Maheen to shop so much,
that I made a prayer for them,
that may God always keep them happy.
You tell me, how did you like this dress?
Its not good.
Hey,
Roshni,
you have so many tantrums,
I selected this after searching hard.
Ill-mannered!
So this is why you have forgotten me.
You forgot me, when I got upset.
You started caring for your wife so quickly.
I am that easy to forget.
I should be the only one you should remember,
and you will see this.
Thank you, Umar.
What for?
All this,
you got me to shop so much,
thanks.
Mama asked me,
papa gave me the money,
so go thank him.
After all, they didn’t do you a favor,
they paid the salary,
you work so much,
you pressed so many shirts yesterday,
you do the home,
their work, my work,
so what?
You have a problem with that too?
You passed a sarcastic comment on this too.
I took out this solution for our ease.
You are not happy with this either?
What are you happy with Umar?
Um..Umar.
Umar.
You decide what you want.
What are you satisfied with?
I will do that.
Umar, listen,
you have to meet me tomorrow at all cost.
Alright?
You will meet me, right?
The question Maheen asked me,
 I want to ask the same question to myself.
After all, what am I happy about?
What is it that will satisfy me.
I have a feeling of crime, 
a sadness when with Roshni
and when I am with Maheen, I have a regret.
I thought I would also ruin my night like you,
maybe it will reduce the burden on the heart.
Does it reduce?
Do you get answer from there?
Brother, I am already worried,
don’t worry me further.
I am also worried.
Then go to your room and get worried,
what are you doing here?
I am surprised,
you didn’t even ask me about my worry.
Anyway,
I am your elder brother,
tell me what the issue is?
The same?
You still miss her?
Missing her is not an issue,
it’s a pain,
and I go through it.
Then?
Do you still meet her?
This is the issue.
The one that got out of hand,
 running after her.
She is the one running,
I am supporting her.
Brother,
I broke her heart.
I went against my promise,
in a way, I cheated her.
I am really embarrassed.
If I meet her, I do it to wipe her tears.
What do I do?
You tell me, what do I do?
Should I leave her suffering, crying?
When you stop wiping her tears,
she will stop shedding tears.
I wish.
I wish this could happen,
that she forgets me, starts to hate me.
But that poor thing,
loves this unfaithful person I am,
 she loves me with all her heart.
Had she loved you,
she would never be a problem for you.
She would have ended your worries,
 by going away from you.
Brother, please, 
you don’t know anything, you just…
you just leave it.
You are right.
I know nothing.
You know everything well,
you are smart after all.
Umar,
think for Maheen.
I do think about her.
What do you think?
 I don’t think about Maheen?
I think that is why this is my condition,
that is why I am so restless
or else why would it matter to me,
I would have blamed her,
roamed around happy 
and lived my life freely.
Brother, how would you know what the feeling is 
that you are doing injustice to two people.
Because of you two people are worried,
unhappy and even after you wanting to and trying a lot,
you are unable to do anything.
At times I think,
I swear,
I want to kill myself.
I take my life, 
so that this daily living and dying ends.
Man, you are a bigger coward than me,
although I always praised your bravery.
Forget her.
What is the point of running
after the one who is not in your fate.
Maheen is attached to your fate,
so accept her with your heart,
she is a good girl.
When did I say she is a bad girl?
I never said that.
But what do I do with my heart,
that only beats for her?
Brother, I cannot leave her,
I cannot live without her.
You just pray for me
that she leaves me,
she forgets me, starts hating me.
She frees me of her love.
