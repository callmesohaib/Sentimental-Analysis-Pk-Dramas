Grandma, all ok?
You have not slept till now.
You go and sleep,
I am waiting for Umar.
Go.
Umar, wait a minute. Wait.
Brother, what happened?
Go up from here.
Brother, I will listen to your lectures tomorrow,
I am tired, I want to go inside.
Hey, I am not that sad for you Umar
that I take you along with me
and have you sit with me,
but you don’t go inside from this way,
go upstairs,
then in the morning take the other way home.
What happened?
The situation is not good for you,
I am saying it to save you.
I will see the situation myself,
what will happen?
Mama and papa will curse me at the most,
they will scold me, insult me, I will hear it.
Hey, listen to me. Umar.
Umar.
Umar, come here.
Come here.
You, how dare you? 
What are you doing?
Grandma.
Grandma, have you gone mad?
I will get hurt.
Hey you move.
Have you gone mad?
Leave him grandma.
You will get married again!
Have I gone mad?
He will get hurt.
Umar, you leave from here.
Go from here. Umar, go upstairs.
Leave him grandma, he made a mistake.
You think I am mad.
Leave him grandma, we will sit and talk.
Leave me.
Grandma, calm down. Sit down.
He doesn’t care about his ill parents.
He will get married again,
And keep two wives.
He is really young.
Look at him.
Grandma, we will sit and talk.
Your blood pressure will shoot up.
What is there to talk about?
What will I talk about?
Go talk to him, make him understand.
Sit calmly and then we can talk.
What happened? You come. Come.
Move.
Oh man.
I had told you earlier,
you should have come upstairs
and saved yourself from getting beaten.
Does it hurt?
You know, grandma has a heavy hand.
Please,
you leave me alone for a little while.
Is it her?
You know, there is something,
one minute,
is Najia standing there and listening?
These extramarital affairs have an advantage,
when a person is getting insulted at home,
he can get bandage done from outside.
Please man!
Hey, I was joking to uplift your mood.
uplift my mood?
What will I do by being ok,
when nothing else is getting fixed.
When you have put your hand in the bee hive,
then face all this.
This much hell had to be raised
and now more will happen
if you stay strong on what you have said,
obviously, this thing will get out of the house,
you will have to listen to a lot more,
you are already worried.
I am worried thinking about something else.
What?
Tell me something,
why is she doing all this?
What all this?
Why is she supporting me?
why is she helping me?
why is she taking my side in front of everyone?
Why is she doing all this?
I can answer this question,
but I want that you find
the answer for this question yourself,
ask yourself.
Is it friendship or sympathy?
Look for it.
Look for it, look for the answer, Umar.
You will find it.
I know
but I want that you find out yourself.
Good luck!
Grandma,
breakfast.
I don’t want breakfast by your hand.
Take it from here.
Take it from here.
Who do you want to be fed breakfast?
By the hands of Umar’s second wife.
Go call her.
You really want to see Umar married again.
Grandma,
you have such a big heart,
then why did you react on this thing?
Make some place in your heart.
Look Maheen, this is my heart,
not a rented home, 
that I give anyone place.
You are being smart and 
giving your grandmother suggestions.
Look if you bother me more,
I will tell your mother.
Tell her.
Yes,
when you don’t care about your mother in law,
your husband,
your grandma,
then why would you be scared of your mother?
Let it be girl. Let it be.
Umar won’t let it be, grandma.
You will stop him from marrying,
but you cannot stop him from meeting that girl.
How long will you stop him from marriage?
He will do what he wants one day.
Instead of him doing it secretly,
won’t it be better all this
 is done by your agreement.
If this is done in front of you, grandma,
a lot of relations will be saved from breaking.
Why did you wake up so early?
Rest a little more.
Did you find out anything,
who is the girl that Umar wants to marry.
Najia,
I better not hear anything like this from you.
Great,
if the family talks about it, its fine,
if I talk about it you mind it.
Najia, no one is happy with this decision of Umar,
now if you repeat it again and again,
 then mama and papa won’t like it.
Fine, I won’t repeat it,
but when he brings her as his second wife,
everyone will know.
The youngest of the family 
are creating a great example.
Okay, lower your voice.
I agree whatever Umar is doing is wrong,
but what can we do?
What do you mean?
We can do something for Maheen,
that poor thing, faced with sorrow.
Her family doesn’t 
ask her how she is, nor do we.
Please Mansoor, do something.
I even called aunt yesterday.
Monis spoke to me and cut the call.
Why are you adding fuel to the fire?
I am telling you to stay away from this matter,
we will see what happens.
Right now, I am worried more 
for mama and papa, then Umar.
Maheen too is supporting Umar,
I have never seen such a wife ever before.
What can she do?
she has to be involved 
in her husband’s happiness.
Okay, I am going to the office,
I have made breakfast for you, ok?
Have breakfast. Okay?
Thank you.
Okay.
Take care.
Umar will not learn Razia.
What he has to do secretly,
if he does it with our agreement a lot of 
relations will be saved from breaking.
Does it hurt?
Will he marry by his will?
Yes,
he is young,
he is of age and independent too.
He has even told us of the favor
 he did to us by sacrificing on our will.
I am afraid of the day,
Razia when my son stands 
in front of me and blames me,
shows his favor that
he killed his heart’s wishes for my happiness,
that is the reason.
And Maheen?
Did you not think about her even once?
I am thinking about her, 
that is why I am unable to decide.
Let me think. Let me think.
Whatever the decision is,
it will have Maheen’s betterment by the will of God.
Umar,
meet me once so that I can tell you
 that I didn’t want to hurt you.
I am going through so much for you,
and you cannot go 
through this much for me.
At least meet me.
Where are you going?
Market.
I will also come along.
Mama, on the way back I have to go to my friend.
Fine, I too will meet your friend and her brother.
Mama...
Why? What happened?
Listen to me.
Look,
if those people have a 
problem bringing a proposal,
I will go talk to her mother myself.
I will tell her that 
she has a daughter in her home
and her son is defaming
 my daughter in the whole city.
What defamation, mama?
Now you are making noise and 
defaming me yourself, that is different.
Roshni,
you won’t go anywhere.
If that man brings a proposal for you
 in a week to ten days, then fine
or else
I will fix your wedding with Mr. Haji’s son,
after all, he has been
 begging me for a few days.
Is that fat man only left for me?
A family of seven to eight brothers and sisters,
I don’t want to get in so much rush.
Really?
If you don’t want to go there,
then tell your friend to bring her 
brother’s proposal for you,
that won’t happen.
He won’t bring a proposal.
Because such men only 
take you around the city,
but no one makes you
 the respect of their home, Roshni.
Mama,
I am going to meet my friend, not him.
And what you want,
I will say it all.
No,
because I will say all this myself
 and in my own words.
I will go with you right now.
Mama,
so that their intention of bringing the proposal
 that too ends because of your bitter talk.
Why do you want to ruin everything?
Look, he is not a bad man,
he will come soon with his parents,
you have trusted me so much,
just trust me a little more, please.
I’ll go and,
Come back quickly.
Bye.
Its been so many days,
we have not gone to find out 
how brother and Razia are.
If you come early today,
then let’s go in the evening?
I will get late, mama.
Then tomorrow?
Do one thing, go today,
 what if I don’t get time in future or not.
Why do I feel you don’t want to go there.
Think that.
Did you mind anything Razia said?
You know her temperament and she is on the bed 
and it has made her short tempered.
I don’t even pay heed to anything she says.
Now that is my daughter’s in-laws house,
or else I used to insult her a lot.
If it’s the in-laws so what?
Should we listen to everything wrong they say?
The daughter stays their, 
lives with her in-laws.
Earlier your life’s mission was 
that she gets married,
where ever she gets married, to anyone.
Now your life’s mission is that
 the daughter lives with her in-laws.
No one thinks in all this 
what Maheen is going through.
Hey, what is she going through? 
Someone tell me.
Have things not been fixed?
I thought she must have cared for
 her mother in law, and won her heart.
Razia’s mood will be fine.
That’s it,
we sent her there so that she can serve them.
You have a problem meeting me now.
Please Roshni, nothing like that.
I am really worried,
you know it all
and I don’t want that
 I meet you in this worry,
for no reason you too will be tensed.
So do I have any less tension?
There is such a good proposal at home,
the family is pressurizing me.
Now don’t say that
 I say yes to that proposal.
I will feel you are getting rid of me,
that is why I said that to you,
because I know that you are tensed, 
your family is pressurizing you,
insulting you, I realize that.
Look,
I was just saying that you…
I what?
You said yourself
that your friendship with Maheen is the same,
then ask Maheen as a friend 
who she likes and who is in her heart.
Please, Roshni?
Look, listen to me,
this way you alone won’t be blamed,
you can tell your family 
that Maheen’s will was in it,
because Maheen likes someone else.
Roshni, please…
No Umar, listen to me,
you ask Maheen for 
whom is she doing all this.
Stop it Roshni,
you know Maheen well and so do I.
Maheen is not such a girl,
she is not that girl, you know.
She is not like that sort of girl,
so this means I am that sort of a girl.
No.
You want to say this,
right that I am such a girl and she is not.
Roshni…
This is the limit.
The limit.
Roshni.
Roshni.
I didn’t expect this from Mr. Fareed,
that he would stay under
 the pressure of his children in this age.
All his life he kept the eye of
 a tiger on his children.
Hey, along with papa, 
Mansoor too has a soft corner,
he is also supporting Umar.
The whole family is ready to get beaten,
where is Fareed?
Call him, I will ask him what is the fear 
that he has from his son?
When he has to answer in front of the family,
what will we say?
Grandma, leave everything,
lets go to that girl’s home 
and insult her there.
Yes, that’s right,
before we get insulted in our family,
we should insult her so much that 
she is unable to show her face in public.
Mama, who is that damned girl?
Maheen knows, but she won’t tell us.
Mansoor must know, 
I will make him tell us.
You tell Fareed,
to find out from Umar.
Umar won’t tell him.
Hey, tell him that 
we are here to fix the wedding,
if he tells the name and address, 
then we will go.
Grandma, great idea. 
This way we will also find out.
Okay fine.
Find out.
Ok.
Mama, should I massage oil in your head.
Hey the massage will be done, 
first find out.
Where is Fareed, call him.
Should I call him?
Call him,
do get the oil too.
Roshni,
please stop crying.
Roshni, you are taking me wrong, 
my love stop crying.
I understood correctly,
if she doesn’t like someone,
she is not that sort of a girl
and I like you so I am that sort of a girl.
You are taking me wrong.
I am understanding correctly.
I lie at home and come to meet you,
I spend time with you alone, 
I want to marry you,
so I became someone with a bad character.
What are you saying…
Maheen is really respectable, right?
Roshni, its not that,
 you are taking me wrong.
I am not wrong,
I am thinking right.
Its good I found out your reality,
what was in your heart, 
came on your tongue.
Your love has already 
given me a lot of sorrow,
fine,
another one now.
Your love has only given me tears and 
pain and now give me defamation too.
What?
I…
one minute, man.
I will defame you?
Me?
I love you, why would I defame you?
I am sorry, man, I know I have hurt you,
forgive me.
I will also make amends for it.
I took a week’s time from you that 
I will send my family over with a proposal,
now I will send them sooner, you will see.
You did it and I will see.
Roshni.
Roshni, listen to me…
Leave me, Umar.
Mama, you came suddenly…
Its good,
she will know clearly today.
Hello.
Why?
Are you really worried that 
your mother doesn’t get worried finding out,
making weird wishes from your uncle,
giving Umar incorrect confidence, 
did you not care about us?
What is wrong mama? All ok?
What is ok, Zakia?
You are here now,
ask your daughter what she has been doing.
What did you do?
Did you fight with Umar again?
I told you so many times 
not to fight with your husband.
Okay no problem, 
I will make her understand,
they are husband and wife, 
they have arguments.
Why are you not telling me? 
what did you do?
Did you fight with your husband?
If she considered him her husband,
 she would fought then.
Hey, does a wife do what she is doing?
I am sure she doesn’t want to live with Umar.
No sister, how is that possible?
 Why don’t you tell me, what did you do?
Do you have shame?
I trusted you so much 
and you have lowered my head
and you are standing 
in front of me so stubbornly.
Lie to me,
cheat me again,
say that whatever I saw was wrong,
it was a lie,
say that I cannot see.
Was this your friend’s brother?
Yes,
he was not my friend’s brother,
he was my friend’s husband.
Are you happy now after spying on me?
Shameless!
So much happened but 
you have no shame in your eyes.
I want to go to Zakia right now and
 tell her to tighten her son in law’s ropes,
he is having an affair with a wife at home.
But what can I do?
I cannot do this,
I cannot say all this.
Because he is a man,
the woman gets blamed.
People will spit on you.
Everyone will say that you didn’t 
even leave your friend’s home.
I didn’t attack my friend’s home,
she cheated me,
she knew about me and Umar, 
then why did she come in between?
And I will not leave my place.
What place? What position?
You have nothing.
He married that girl in front of everyone.
He is married.
He is someone’s husband.
You shameless girl, 
not anyone’s she is your friend’s husband.
Forget him.
I will not forget him!
I will not let anyone take over my fate,
what is mine is mine!
What is a wedding,
its there today,
it won’t be there tomorrow.
She will not stay his wife.
Where did you get this courage from?
I am thinking,
why didn’t I choke you to death
 when you were born?
You have any idea
 how you have cheated me?
You have any idea?
Shameless, are you not ashamed?
Die.
Die.
Today you have killed me while I am alive.
Go!
If it was just about Umar,
we would have beaten him up
 and made him understand,
but we are upset with her,
she is supporting Umar.
She has almost convinced her father in law.
Zakia, talk to your daughter, 
make her understand,
I am worried that she will leave 
alone taking her husband as a groom.
We have been made fun of,
 people have cursed us,
but Zakia, you too will have to get 
your daughter sit at home.
She doesn’t want to live in her home, 
she wants others to live in that home.
Mama.
What are you doing?
Get out of my way.
Leave her. Leave her.
Leave me.
Leave her Zakia. Leave her. 
Stop Zakia. Leave her.
Zakia, stop it.
You are my son in law,
 so I cannot raise my hand on you.
Or else what her fault is,
 you have a bigger mistake.
Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
Umar. Umar, take her inside,
Zakia will kill her.
You should have thought of this earlier,
you are calling aunt Zakia, 
and complaining about her,
this will happen.
Everyone hear me clearly,
no one punish Maheen for what I did.
Come on Maheen.
This girl has ruined me.
she has ruined my peace, Umar too.
I will get water.
Yes.
Relax.
Maheen.
Maheen, I am sorry.
Maheen, sorry, all this is because of me.
No.
No.
all this is because of me,
had I not come in your way,
your path would have been easier.
But I too have ruined your path because of me,
I am so selfish,
I did something so wrong,
for my work, for myself, I put you in front.
You got blamed for everything.
To be honest, I felt that if you agree,
the whole family would agree easily 
or else they might never agree.
But I didn’t know all this would happen.
Okay, please stop crying Maheen.
I am not crying cause of you,
I am crying cause of my mother.
I never wanted to hurt her,
 but I gave her pain.
Even I never wanted to hurt you,
but I did.
I am not hurt Umar,
I am fine.
Sorry Maheen.
You have to hear so much,
you have to go through so much.
Now no more.
I…
I will fight my battle myself.
I am sorry.
What was the need to raise your hand on the daughter, 
what is her fault in it?
How do I raise my hand on 
the one who is at fault, brother?
The one whose responsibility it is 
to raise his hand on, he has given up.
What do you mean?
Is there just one solution for all problems?
Raising your hand on your young children?
But brother, at least give me enough permission
 to stop Maheen from doing what she is doing.
If the wife gets stubborn,
especially when the in-laws are standing with her,
then the husband won’t 
dare go anywhere else.
This thankless girl doesn’t see this 
that the in-laws are with her,
she is willing to ruin her life herself.
Okay sister in law,
I will leave now.
I have one request with 
you people to stand with her,
put some sense into her head.
This widow doesn’t have the courage to see
 my divorced daughter standing at my door now.
God forbid Zakia.
Brother, I don’t know 
why you are taking Umar’s side,
what is your helplessness,
I just know that I gave you my daughter,
its your responsibility to make her settle down in this home,
if you send her back,
I will kill her and die myself too.
Zakia…
Bad time has come on me today,
you left me,
you left me alone, 
stopped talking to me.
You got upset with me yourself 
and now you are being stubborn.
Mama was right,
men like you consider a girl a toy
 and play with her emotions,
you have shown your 
true colors really soon, Umar.
I was just a temporary entertainment for you,
you just wanted to play,
you wanted to enjoy, you did that,
and now you left me, right?
You did wrong with me, Umar.
You did really wrong.
And you have left me alone at this time.
I am all alone.
You had said your friendship 
with Maheen is the same,
then ask Maheen as a friend who she likes,
who is in her heart.
Please Roshni…
Look, listen. Listen to me,
this way you will not be blamed alone,
you can tell your family 
that Maheen’s will was in it,
because Maheen likes someone else.
