You are not at peace,
instead of staying on your bed comfortably,
you go around so much.
You are not well Fareed.
No, its your superstition mama.
Hello.
Hello. Live long.
I am just going, bye.
Okay, bye.
Go safe, come back safe.
See Fareed,
our Umar has become so smart,
and responsible.
In his age, even you were
not this smart and responsible,
he cares for everyone so much,
he cares for everyone.
He worries.
Umar.
Yes papa.
Come back in the evening,
don’t get too late.
I have to talk about something important.
Yes.
Fine.
What do you want to talk about, Fareed?
Is everything ok?
Yes, everything is fine.
No, there is something,
I have been seeing since yesterday,
everyone is upset.
Everyone is quiet,
there is something that
all of you are hiding from me.
You are mistaken mama,
another superstition.
Yes,
I have grown old,
I am old,
I have no importance in this home,
no one tells me anything.
Everyone hides things from me.
What do you say?
Should we talk to Umar straightforwardly?
First let me decide
what I have to talk about.
What is there to think about in this?
Tell him clearly to take out
that girl from his heart
and live in this home like a decent man.
If there is a need, scold him.
If I had found out about
this some time back, Razia.
I would have been strict with Umar,
I would have forced him,
but now this will not happen.
Why?
Why can’t it happen now?
I have seen death from up-close Razia.
So much life has passed,
yours and my wedding,
kids, their wedding.
We saw success and defeat,
we saw it all.
We didn’t lose the will to live.
You know when I saw death in front of me,
all the hidden happiness in
my heart came in front of my eyes,
that I won’t be able to see
them being complete.
God forbid,
what are you saying?'
I have lived my life,
in fact, figured it out.
When someone like me feels this way,
then my Umar is a child,
won’t he have wishes in his heart?
Do I make him regret?
Hey,
how have you started thinking?
For God’s sake Mr. Fareed, be smart.
Will you get cursed by the family
to fulfil your son’s wish?
Will you make a new example by bringing
a second wife on top of your niece.
That’s it.
That’s it.
That is where I stop thinking about Maheen.
You and I can’t get her,
her happiness and right even if we want to.
Even if we listen to Umar and even
if we don’t listen to Umar, then too.
Then too?
Look,
if we scold and force
Umar to live with Maheen,
how will Maheen stay happy with someone about
whom she knows that he likes someone else.
Tell me.
With time everything gets fine.
I swear, I am telling the truth,
he is fat,
he’s bald and old too.
I am sure he is at least
 twenty years older than you.
Don’t you dare speak all this nonsense, Umar.
This is not nonsense, I am telling the truth.
Now what else could aunt do,
for you she was getting proposal
for handicapped people.
Umar stop it, I am going.
Okay listen, listen to me.
look, she too had to think that
 I have an average looking cousin,
matric fail, who knows no work,
 we would find such a proposal for her.
I am telling mama, 
that you are bothering me.
Okay listen…
What?
Okay listen,
I am preparing you mentally so that
 you don’t get a heart attack seeing him suddenly.
You should have seen his picture,
at least you would have said no in shame.
What would I do, 
had I seen his picture even?
Even if he was really bald and 
fat I wouldn’t have been able to say no.
I would have said yes, quietly.
Mama decided, 
she must have done it after thinking.
Its fine, we will get his plastic surgery done.
Keep back the cucumber.
What? Maheen!
No, you are misbehaving with me.
Man, you are such a miser.
Boo!!!
Hey, what happened?
 What are you doing?
I was fixing the bulb.
What if you fell?
I fell because of you.
Okay fine, don’t fall on me now.
You idiot.
You should have asked me, 
I would have done it.
I would have had a heart attack.
But see I changed the bulb.
Yes, thank you very much, 
you did something great.
I would have died.
Monis.
Monis, are you listening?
Yes, I am listening.
Fazeela’s mother called,
she and her elders are coming 
over to our home in the evening.
Your uncle and aunt cannot come, 
and its difficult for grandma too.
I am thinking of calling 
Maheen and even Umar.
Look mama,
no need for so many arrangements,
and I will talk to Fazeela’s family myself 
that I want to get married not setup a show.
What are you saying?
What show?
Hey its their happiness,
they will have wishes
and I too will marry my only son 
the same way that I have thought.
Everyone will gather for the first time 
after Maheen’s wedding.
Its good,
they will meet Maheen too.
Your maternal side really want 
to see Maheen and Umar together.
So are we the only ones 
left for the family’s fun.
Mama, I have decided
 and this is my wish too
that whatever will happen 
will be done with simplicity
and I will not talk about this further.
We will have the wedding at home,
and the reception will be 
done on the roof or outside.
We don’t have so much spare 
money for the family’s entertainment.
I am telling you there is a tension at home, 
but you are saying what you want.
Hey, we can also fix the wedding 
without Maheen and Umar.
How are you talking?
Huh?
It means you don’t understand my worry,
I have been saying for so long 
that the situation is tense, but no,
you have your own stubbornness, 
you don’t understand.
Bring everyone. 
Bring everyone. Bring everyone.
Hey,
I am not bringing anyone, 
and we are not fixing any date.
Tea.
Uncle, your special tea.
Yes, sit child.
I called you because…
I want to talk to you uncle.
That’s it,
we are only able to talk and listen,
your uncle has not left 
us capable of doing anything.
If you give me permission right now,
I will fix Umar.
He will not even dare 
looking at someone else.
Then you will be tormenting him again.
Torment?
He is tormenting you.
He didn’t make any promises to me 
that he is failing to live up to.
But he made promises to her,
and you help him in fulfilling those promises.
What are you saying, Maheen?
You get Umar married where his heart is.
Sit here.
I have lied at home and come,
mama has doubts 
and here you are upset.
I am not upset, I am just tensed.
Why are you in tension?
I should be the one who should be tense,
because whatever you saying,
I don’t believe it even a little bit.
What do you think, I am lying?
You are not lying,
but you have been lied to
and you have believed it 
with your eyes closed.
Why would any girl talk to her mother and
 father in law for her husband’s second wedding?
I don’t believe it.
You have any idea what you are saying Maheen?
I am saying this after thinking a lot.
After thinking a lot?
Or did Umar threaten you 
and forced you to say this.
Maheen,
you are saying all this out of emotion,
whatever it is.
Look, this is not an action we can take,
its not possible, 
no one can even think about it.
Could anyone think that me
and Umar would get married?
Could you think that you would go to your 
niece’s wedding and bring home a daughter in law?
When the situation is against our estimate,
then this is also fine.
At least someone’s happiness is in this.
Whose happiness?
His mother is not happy,
I am not happy,
you are not happy
and even Zakia won’t be 
happy finding out all this.
We give everyone sorrow
 for Umar’s happiness?
You think that my happiness is in this too.
God knows what magic Umar has done on you.
I am telling you,
even if your uncle agrees hearing 
your emotional dialogues,
I will never agree.
I am telling you, with me around,
Umar cannot bring a second wife to this home.
he can bring her later, Razia.
Don’t say that, uncle.
God always have both 
your shadows on our head.
The situation clearly tells us
that Umar has decided,
that is why Maheen is saying
 all this out of disappointment.
I am not saying it out of disappointment,
I am making the decision with my heart.
You fulfill Umar’s wish,
just like he fulfilled your wish once.
Uncle,
there is a big burden on my heart,
I took over his life like an uninvited guest, 
uncle, free me of this burden.
Uncle,
you marry Umar there,
where his heart is.
Oh may I die! Umar’s second marriage?
Maheen is saying she will talk
and I know she will surely talk.
Will she only talk or convince them too?
She…
You and your trust, Umar.
Why would she want that 
you get married again, Umar?
We could have believed it
 when she left home,
but now,
when she has come back in that home,
its clear that she doesn’t want to end this relation
and why would she want that
 a second wife comes in that home.
It doesn’t matter to her at all.
I think you are forgetting Roshni,
even after my marriage, she let us meet.
She gave me up to you, so easily.
Did you forget?
All this just means one thing,
that maybe,
she likes someone else.
Listen…listen to me first.
You are not able to accept her as your wife,
you cannot accept this relation, why?
Because you know me from before,
you love me,
she cannot accept you either,
what does all this mean?
That she likes someone else, 
she wants someone else.
What nonsense is this man?
What the hell are you saying?
Come here, take this.
Roshni, I have to go,
 I cannot talk right now. You…
I am going.
Come here!
What is this, man?
Such rubbish.
Take it away!
Hey, damn it, bloody hell! 
So this is what he was up to.
I was thinking that he is working,
he is married, he has become smart, 
he goes to work.
But no, he goes around having his way, 
instead of going to work.
And mama, God knows how long 
this has been going on for.
Hey, you stop crying.
And mama,
what will doing all this achieve?
Mama, curse Umar later,
first ask him,
he is being sympathetic to his beloved.
To hell with your sympathies, 
where is Umar?
Call him.
I will teach him a lesson, he will learn.
And, she is so cunning, 
have you got no shame?
You really want to get
 a second wife to this home.
Listen to me, if not us,
 then at least think about your mother.
I am only thinking of bringing back
 happiness to this home, grandma.
Happiness!
The whole community will curse us,
people will blame us that 
we got a second wife to this home.
Who all will we clarify 
that you are involved in this.
Grandma, you are worried about the curses of 
the family and not Umar’s happiness?
And after all,
are you related to the people or Umar?
We have a relation with you too, Maheen.
So now do we see Umar’s happiness,
or your future?
Hello,
yes I am here, you too come.
Hey, yes I am coming, 
just give me a minute.
What is the matter? 
Why were you looking at Roshni like that?
How?
Like you were seeing her, 
with your eyes wide open.
Come, I will tell you.
You come, I will also tell you.
Sit.
He is shouting at me like I am his wife.
The one he has at home as his wife, 
he should shout on her.
Anyway,
I have put the thought in his head,
now he will think about marrying me later,
he will now be in a hurry to divorce her.
Even if she is a wife by name,
but if she loves someone else,
who tolerates that.
Well done Roshni. Well done!
You know, this Roshni is
the reason behind the problem.
She is so ill-mannered,
 so cunning, she is so misleading.
And tell me something,
did your brother in law find her to 
get married to leaving behind all relations.
I am still in shock thinking all this.
After knowing all this,
 why is Maheen protecting Umar?
Because this is what you call love,
 this is the name of wedding.
And on top of that 
sister Maheen is really naïve.
I am totally sure that this Roshni must have said 
a lot of wrong things about sister Maheen,
she must have instigated brother Umar, 
that is why he is so misled.
Look, whatever it is, 
whatever she has done or not done,
I don’t care about it.
The thing is that she has left 
no stone unturned to ruin my sister’s life.
and sister Maheen?
Does she not have a tongue?
Can she not fight for her right?
Now you tell me yourself,
how can I say to Maheen in all this tension,
that Maheen,
I want to get married and no matter what happens,
 you need to come to my wedding.
Tell me.
come on, let’s eat something.
All this just means one thing,
that maybe,
she likes someone else.
Listen…listen to me first.
You are not able to accept her as your wife,
you cannot accept this relation, why?
Because you know me from before,
you love me,
she cannot accept you either, 
what does all this mean?
That she likes someone else, 
she wants someone else.
Grandma, all ok?
 You have not slept till now.
You go and sleep,
I am waiting for Umar.
Go.
Umar, wait a minute. Wait.
Brother, what happened?
Go up from here.
Brother, I will listen to your lectures tomorrow, 
I am tired, I want to go inside.
Hey, I am not that sad for you Umar
that I take you along with me 
and have you sit with me,
but you don’t go inside from this front way,
go upstairs,
then in the morning take the other way home.
What happened?
The situation is not good for you,
I was saying it to save you.
I will see the situation,
what will happen?
Mama and papa will curse me the most,
they will scold me, insult me, I will hear it.
Hey, listen to me. Umar.
Umar.
Umar, come here.
Come here.
You, how dare you? What are you doing?
Grandma. 
Grandma, have you gone mad?
I will get hurt.
Hey you move.
Have you gone mad?
Leave him grandma.
You will get married again! 
I have gone mad?
He will get hurt.
Umar, you leave from here.
Go from here. Umar, go upstairs. 
Leave him grandma, he made a mistake.
You think I am mad.
Leave him grandma, we will sit and talk.
Leave me.
Grandma, calm down. Sit down.
He doesn’t care about his ill parents.
He will get married again,
have two wives.
He is really young.
Look at him.
Grandma, we will sit and talk. 
Your blood pressure will shoot up.
What is there to talk about?
What will I talk about? 
Go talk to him, make him understand.
Sit calmly and talk.
What happened? You come. Come.
Move.
Oh man.
I had told you then,
 you should have come up
and saved yourself from getting beaten.
Does it hurt?
You know, grandma has a heavy hand.
Please,
you leave me alone for a little while.
Is it her?
You know, there is something,
one minute,
is Najia standing there and listening?
These extramarital affairs have an advantage,
when a person is getting insulted at home,
he can get bandage done from outside.
Please man!
Hey, I was joking to fix your mood.
Fix my mood?
What will I do to fix my mood, 
when nothing else is getting fixed.
When you have put your hand in the bee hive,
 then face all this.
This much hell had to be raised
and now more will happen
 if you stay strong on what you have said,
obviously, this thing will get out of the house,
you will have to listen to a lot more,
you are already worried.
I am worried thinking about something else.
What?
Tell me something,
why is she doing all this?
What all this?
Why is she supporting me?
why is she helping me?
why is she taking my side in front of everyone?
Why is she doing all this?
I can answer this question,
but I want that you find 
the answer for this question yourself,
ask yourself.
Is it friendship or sympathy?
Look for it.
Look for it, look for the answer, Umar.
You will find it.
I know
but I want that you find out yourself.
Good luck!
