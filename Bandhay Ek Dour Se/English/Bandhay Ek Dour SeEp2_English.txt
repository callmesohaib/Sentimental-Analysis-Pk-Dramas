I don’t know aunt, 
you come with us right now.
Hey, why do you bother her?
I mean, 
its not her age to travel in rickshaws.
It takes an hour to one and a half
hours to get to our home in a rickshaw.
No, mama is fine now. After all,
she wants to see her
granddaughter happy. Mama go.
Yes, sure.
Son, talk to the generator guy to give
us the generator on rent for a few days.
We have 10-12 hours of
load shedding, mama will fall ill.
Yes, I will go and say for a month,
when he gets married.
Yeah, haha.
Zakia,
did you look for a girl for Monis?
Mama, you look for a girl for Monis.
Why Monis? Why not you?
Zakia aunt,
she will find someone for me.
Right aunt Zakia,
we will share responsibilities.
Yes, why not,
but I have found a girl for Monis.
Huh?
What?
Yes, must be from your in-laws,
with huge teeth.
I have seen her,
she grew up in front of me,
she played with Maheen, 
our homes are connected,
she lives in our neighborhood
and my Monis likes her too.
I will go make a call and come back,
there are no signals here.
No need, I know all your signals, these excuses to
go to the roof, I will fix your signals, sit and eat.
Okay,
so you fixed Monis’ wedding along with 
Mahi and grandma doesn’t know.
Hey mama,
nowadays weddings are fixed like this, 
secretly.
What is the point of telling the relatives?
They put the evil eye and 
then they create issues.
You did good Zakia.
I am the grandma,
I am not from the people 
who will put an evil eye.
Let me know what problems 
I have created earlier?
You do good by helping your 
mother in law out in serving the guests.
I have heard you got a separate stove.
Yes, she did it, but it took 1.5 years,
unlike you, you went away in 4 months.
Grandma, tea.
Monis, have tea.
I will not let you break the 
relation half way through.
Your wedding is fixed 
and you didn’t even tell me,
that too with my cousin, Monis.
Pick up your phone, damn it.
Why did you leave me 
alone and come here?
I got mama,
but the situation is not right.
You handle the situation.
You are ruining the situation 
and you want me to handle it.
Look at me,
how long has this been going on for?
What?
Proposal, wedding and all this?
Oh that?
Mama said that Mani will get married, 
the house will be empty,
I told her to get it.
You are really straight,
did your mother not find 
anyone else but your neighbor?
So?
No, I mean…
you are the only son,
aunt should have been 
careful when finding your wife,
she found someone
and fixed the wedding.
What is wrong in that? 
Both families know each other.
So,
they must know what 
you are up to they will say no.
Nothing like that, 
they have said yes and just like that.
Hey,
this?
You still look at it?
You tore the magazine?
You tore the magazine?
You tore the magazine?
You tore the magazine? 
Why did you tear my magazine?
Leave me. Have you gone mad?
You tore the magazine yourself.
You will hit me for a magazine?
Here, go from here.
What happened?
Monis go from here,
Hey, what happened?
get lost.
Tell me.
This one?
This one. I wanted this one!
Roshni, I have not worn it once, 
it’s a completely new dress.
You have a small heart, 
I will not take your precious dress. Weird.
No Roshni, 
I didn’t mean that. Roshni.
Roshni, wait man, wait.
I was just saying,
you keep it, 
it will look nice on you.
Thank you.
Okay, tell me something,
tell me, who is your 
friend where you are going?
You are investigating me a lot.
Man, 
Rizwana aunt, she is our neighbor,
she has asked for my hand for her brother,
and I don’t like her brother a lot, 
he is dark skin,
I don’t like it. If the boy is good looking 
like Shahid Kapoor, it makes sense.
Roshni, what is wrong with you?
You have such a nice guy, Umar for you.
Why do you talk about strangers like this?
Umar is just the name, God gave him a good face, 
but when it comes to his intelligence, he is zero.
He is smart, listen to me.
He only cares for his family a lot,
I am sure he will convince the family, 
what are you doing?
I am here, when all this 
will be fulfilled, we will see.
I am taking your dress, 
I will return it. Ok?
Roshni…
Bye.
I want this back.
Yes, thank you bye.
Don’t ruin it.
I love you.
I want my earrings back.
Thief.
Oh…
Oh…phone. 
I have to clean my hands.
One minute, don’t cut the call.
One minute.
Yes, go ahead.
Hello. Yes, go ahead 
what happened. Hello.
Leave this hello, 
tell me what you did to me?
Monis’ wedding is fixed with the 
neighbors and you didn’t even tell me.
Yes, sorry,
I had to tell you, in fact, 
I had to tell you first, one second..
i was making chicken.
I had to tell you first, but you 
know mama does what she wants.
Since when did the two of 
you become so obedient.
Did you not think about me?
You are so selfish. Both of you.
You should have told me.
Now don’t talk to me again, 
don’t get in touch.
I will not let this happen Roshni,
you talk so much,
but you couldn’t say no to your family,
not at all.
I will not let you get married to Monis.
Oh
Oh God.
Here.
Keep it.
Please, I have a headache, 
don’t eat my brain.
Today my doubt changed to reality.
Which doubt?
That Umar and Mani.
Oh God, you are still stuck there.
That girl is getting married,
why do you want to defame her.
Umar is so happy 
like her real brother.
That is the thing.
I felt I was mistaken,
but today I am sure I was right.
You know today aunt Zakia came 
with the sweets for Mahi’s wedding,
you know he had a hope that 
this proposal would end,
that is gone too. If you were here,
you would have seen Umar’s long face,
you would have worried.
He has locked himself in the room 
and seeing his face, I realized…
Cant you see my face and 
realize that I really need to tea.
You only read the faces of people.
I will get it, listen to me first. 
Umar loves Mahi.
I am sure mama arranged 
something for aunt Zakia over tea,
if something is left, get that too.
A lot is saved,
because aunt Zakia 
was full of mama’s taunts
and then what was left, 
mama lovingly gave to grandma.
Mama, fed grandma. 
How did that happen?
Why wouldn’t that happen?
Grandma insulted the younger 
daughter in law so much,
you can’t imagine. 
So she cared for her.
Man, this female politics, 
I don’t get it.
What politics?
I gave you such a big news 
and you call it politics.
Umar has called so many 
times and driven me mad.
See, if you find a someone so 
mad after you like this, change my name.
Roshni doesn’t need this,
and she has people like Umar 
around her all the time.
I am sure something happened at home,
so he is calling again and again.
He only has excuses, 
that we will do this today,
I will do that, it does nothing.
Poor thing, I feel bad for him,
he caught between love 
and issues at home. He has gone mad too.
Maheen, no man is poor, 
they all need one thing.
Ok, brother Monis is here, 
I will talk to you later.
Fine.
Stop it. Come sit there.
If mama had told them earlier, 
this wouldn’t have happened.
You know sister in law’s anger was justified.
I am sure Umar told you to say this, 
that is why I don’t go to your uncle.
Mama, brother is right,
you know, in our good and bad times,
grandma and uncle have come to our help. 
Whether aunt likes it or not.
Well done child, well done.
Your mother worked hard to bring you up 
and you are taking your grandma’s side.
Oh God, go from here, leave me alone.
Mama, I have made bread, 
don’t ask me for anything else,
my head hurts, I am going to sleep.
What is his problem? I have told him 
so many times not to call me,
but still he is calling again and again.
Oh…
Don’t think Roshni that you will 
cheat me and hide your face.
You will have to give me an answer. 
Why did you do this with me?
Has he gone mad?
I was with mama, 
I couldn’t answer his phone.
I don’t want to talk to you either.
I won’t respond on call or 
reply to his message. Stupid, idiot.
She cut my call?
This means Monis was right,
she agreed to the wedding.
If she had to do all this, 
then why did she fool me?
What did you think? what do 
we gift on the wedding I mean?
What will I think?
you decided everything 
yourself I am sure. I don’t care.
You sell the home and gift it as a gift, 
or sell the land.
If it is still less, then take a loan.
Why would I do that? 
Take a loan. I will give what I can.
Then give a tea set,
cause the financial condition 
of yours that you tell us,
giving her a tea set is out of our reach.
Its useless to talk to you,
mama, you tell me.
Maheen,
if she was not the last sign of my son,
I wouldn’t even give Zakia’s child my fever.
What can we do, 
we will have to give her something.
Give everything at the wedding.
On the engagement give her 1000 or 2000.
I will find a dress at home and give it.
Do what you want,
there are a couple of months to the wedding,
we will figure something out.
I think lets go tomorrow, 
the engagement is in two days.
Hey, what is the need to go?
You really care for her,
you know Zakia has issues caring for guests.
She will have a long face if she 
sees us. We will go on the day, that is it.
Let her make a face, we don’t care.
I will go 2-3 days in advance 
and live there with Umar.
Right Umar? You will come with me, right?
Where?
Hey, where are you focused on?
To Mahi’s home, 
where else? Will you go?
I don’t want to go grandma.
Hey, why not?
Mama, if the kid is not in the mood, 
leave it, why do you force her?
Fine, drop grandma.
No papa, I cannot go drop her,
call Monis, he will come 
pick her up. I have work.
Why Mr. Umar?
What work do you have?
He must have work.
Why do you want to go to the 
engagement 2 days in advance?
He will go with us, that is it.
No, I won’t go with you,
I won’t go, not now, 
not then. I don’t want to go,
nor should anyone ask me to go.
Hey Umar, 
what happened to you? Are you mad?
You won’t go to Mahi’s engagement? 
Mahi’s engagement?
You two have played together 
since childhood, you have so much love.
Wont this break her heart?
Huh?
Someone must have said something, 
that is why he is not going.
Yes, I create issues.
Umar.
Did you add sugar?
You get sugar in this age.
Put your finger in it, 
it will be come poison.
Ask mama. I will do it.
Why are you calling me now?
Where are you everyone 
is waiting for you for so long.
You know its music night, please, 
if you don’t come it won’t be fun. Come fast.
Okay, do you want me to sit in front of 
you and you will make fun of my helplessness.
You will set the tone.
Yes, I am here to set the 
tone on your weddings.
Obviously, you are my cousin,
my best friend, 
what is your problem?
Mahi, don’t act smart with me.
What? What happened?
What you are doing,
after all your mission is complete,
why do you need me?
Your work is done, 
your in-laws will be happy that
you befriends your family, 
your engagement will be good, that is it.
Why are you saying this?
What nonsense is this? 
Do you even think before speaking?
This is nonsense? 
What about what you people did to me?
I thought you are naïve,
but you are cunning.
Roshni was right, she told me you 
are cunning, but I didn’t listen to her.
You are cunning.
Fine, so Roshni instigated you.
That is great, you listen to her.
You know me since childhood,
how long have you met her for. 
But she is truthful and I am a liar.
You know what, 
I don’t have time for all this.
You die, you go to hell. 
No one is waiting for you, get lost.
God knows what has happened to this 
mad man, I don’t know what his problem is.
She is responsible and she is blaming me.
Thank God mama went for 2 days,
she interferes in everything.
I couldn’t look for the suit with her around.
Hay
Song.....
Roshni, come sit here. Come on get up.
Dance girls, dance.
What song are you singing?
Song....
Zakia,
you are dancing and 
singing better than the girls.
You are the mother of the girl, 
do you act like this? Have some shame.
Come on, the movie is on.
What is wrong?
You want to watch a movie
and I am sad to see Umar like this. 
Poor thing.
Lock the door,
you are keeping an 
eye on Umar for no reason.
I am coming.
You know you are a bad brother,
why don’t you do anything for him.
What should I do?
Move.
Man…
What do you do?
Talk to mama and papa.
Oh…
I think first I should tell Umar what is going on in 
his heart. That you have found out for no reason,
maybe he doesn’t even 
know what you are up to.
I swear I am telling the truth,
a person acts like this when 
their lover gets married somewhere else
or she will be someone else’s bride.
That is when the person 
acts like this, counts stars.
Okay, leave this, watch the movie.
Hmmm…
How will I watch?
Leave it.
Play it from the start.
Roshni.
Roshni.
Yes?
Why did you leave the music night?
I was getting bored.
You should have told me and come or else 
I wouldn’t have had to hear Zakia’s insult.
Also, tell me what was the need to put 
the plates in front of her mother in law?
You know Zakia was getting upset saying that, 
Roshni is acting like we don’t feed our mother in law.
Ma, she is an old woman,
what happened if I got her food, 
spoke to her. Aunt Zakia is uhhh…
Listen,
we know Zakia,
she is our neighbor,
what is the need to hug 
her mother in law?
Anyway, 
make me a cup of tea.
Mama, I cannot make 
tea in the middle of the night.
Wow,
you have a problem 
feeding your mother,
but you can hug someone else’s 
mother in law calling them an elder.
I am going.
Mama,
I got rice.
Is it left over?
Where did these come from?
No where.
I have to give this dress in 
Maheen’s engagement.
This?
This dress is way better from 
what your mother gave us on the wedding.
Mansoor wants spices with food, 
can I take it.
How long will you feed him spices,
I am waiting for you to have it.
Take this cup too.
Yes papa.
Mansoor, be there on time with 
Nadia, in fact, get there before time.
I am going with your mother, 
at least you get there a night back.
mama agrees?
No i mean..
She agrees, 
you tell me about yourself,
will you be able to convince your mother?
To be happy in the 
happiness of her in-laws.
Can someone start the motor? 
There is no water.
Hero,
what is your plan.
About what?
Will you go with us or will you go with 
your brother and sister in law tomorrow?
Papa I don’t want to go anywhere,
not today, nor tomorrow.
Come here.
Come here.
What is it?
I am talking about 
Maheen’s engagement,
not earning money that 
you made an excuse.
I have an exam papa, 
I have to prepare for it, I cannot go.
What? Paper?
Wow, since childhood if we ask for work,
you said you have an exam, 
you are doing your homework,
studying hard and for years having 
this excuse, you have not done anything.
Three months back your exams ended.
Come with Mansoor and 
Nadia tomorrow, no stupid excuses.
Prepare him.
Yes papa.
I feel Nqadia is right.
What is this time talk about this?
What you are going through, 
I can feel it.
no one can feel it,
not you or the person cause of whom this is happening.
Everyone cares about themselves.
Start the motor.
My home is lucky, 
great people are over.
Stop this, congrats to you, 
may our daughter have a great future.
Amen.
Where is mama?
She is sleeping.
God knows what medication you give her, 
she sleeps all the time.
We didn’t give her medication.
Where is Umar?
He didn’t come.
He has some work, 
he will come tomorrow.
Okay, now his work is more 
important than coming to his aunt’s.
Let him come, I will talk to him.
when he does, scold him.
How are the people?
They are good people,
simple people, 
have good etiquettes.
They love my child.
Hello
Maheen,
how are you?
Listen, I heard Umar’s parents are over, 
make me meet them.
Come meet them yourself.
Hey, how can I meet them like this?
You introduce me nicely.
Why didn’t Umar come, 
will he come tomorrow?
I don’t know.
You must know more.
How will I know, he is 
fighting with me on the call,
he is sending weird messages. 
Listen,
you will go the parlor tomorrow, 
I will come along.
No thank you, I will go myself.
Hey,
how are you talking to me?
No, I don’t need you, bye.
Maheen,
you had a long face on the music night, 
you are still misbehaving with me. Why?
What happened to me?
Did I ask you why 
Umar is so upset with me?
What did you say to him,
he didn’t come to my musical night, 
he has said no to come to my engagement.
Maheen, how do I know, 
he is fighting with me,
not talking to me on the phone, 
he is insulting me.
Don’t be naïve,
he has blamed me, said so much, 
taking your name.
Maheen,
am I mad that I instigate him.
The messages he is sending me,
sending me weird messages,
fighting with me on the call,
its possible you said something stupid and instigated him.
You are responsible you are 
running away, you are blaming me.
I have had enough.
Yeah right.
Umar,
have food
or else mama will say that I was not home for one 
night and the sister in law didn’t give food to you.
Umar.
No,
so you won’t come with us?
I am not going to go, 
don’t even ask me to go.
Hey, we won’t. We won’t.
I know the pain you are going through,
you are facing all this with helplessness,
but brother its too late,
she belongs to someone else.
Why didn’t you tell us before, me and 
Mansoor would have helped you,
and told mama and 
papa to take your proposal.
One minute,
did Maheen said all this to you?
No, why would Maheen say this to me, 
am I friends with her?
Its all on your face.
Yes, now you can sit 
here alone and be sorry.
But it doesn’t matter, 
what had to happen, has happened.
Nothing happened yet and 
I won’t let anything happen.
What would you do? What would you?
When it was time, you didn’t say a word,
what will you do now? 
Now be patient and forget her.
How do I forget her? 
Its not possible to forget her.
I will not do this, 
nor will I sit in sorrow.
I am waiting for the time, 
the right time, when I stop all this.
What do you mean?
Are you in your senses?
Before you do anything 
stupid think 1000 times.
A girl’s respect is delicate,
don’t make a filmy move and ruin it. 
Think about it.
Come on eat,
you don’t get anything 
on an empty stomach.
I don’t want to eat.
I say get up and eat. 
why are you upset with food?
I am not hungry.
Fine, do what you want.
Its not the time to do good, you get 
upset when I say what is best for you.
Hello, where are you people?
I have been calling for so long, 
why don’t you answer my phone.
Send him immediately, 
there is a lot of work.
He is not even answering my phone. 
He has gone mad,
you go and get him.
Look, I will go
but who will do this work?
I will have to do it. If mama 
finds out she will get upset.
No mama won’t say anything 
I will tell her you went to get my flowers. Go.
You will handle it,
Hello.
Get here immediately.
Don’t think I have given up Roshni,
if it was not Mahi’s engagement,
I would have taught you a lesson.
I don’t care about Mahi either,
she doesn’t care for me, 
why should I care for her?
Shahbaz.
Why did you come here?
To get you.
Look,
I have told everyone 
Umar will listen to me.
Come with me.
Get up from here.
I am not well, I won’t go.
Come man.
Did you not hear me? 
Get up from here, leave.
We don’t want  you to work,
come on, lets go, get ready.
I told you I don’t have to go,
you go.
What is the matter Umar?
You didn’t like what mama said?
Look,
Mahi is waiting for you.
Don’t take her name.
its her fault its all cause of her.
I am telling you,
she knew it all, 
she hid it from everyone.
On purpose. Did she tell you?
Ok, you didn’t know 
but she knew it all.
What did she hide?
What did she hide? 
Tell me,
Leave it.  Monis,
if I tell you you won’t be able to tolerate it.
Look, I will find out. Tell me.
What will you do knowing?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Okay, so you didn’t like 
what mama or Maheen said,
you are hurt. Look, 
I promise, I will fix it all.
You will fix it all?
Then go right now,
and tell aunt Zakia that 
you cannot do this marriage.
Where did my wedding come from?
It is your wedding that came in the way.
Now go, why don’t you?
Go, break this wedding, go ahead.
What problem do you 
have with my relation?
I have a problem with your relation,
I like her, I love her. 
We love each other for 2 years,
she too loves me
and We cannot live 
without each other.
You don’t believe me.
Look,
I have pictures with her, 
I also have messages I will show you.
Look Monis, 
you move out from between us.
I love her, I cannot live without her, 
I will not let you be between us.
I will forget everything, 
friendship and relation too.
What?
I…
