Come.
Wish you had come early,
Maheen left a little 
while back asking about you.
I thought I would 
come on theright time and surprise her,
but I got the surprise.
The wedding was during the night,
how did it get done during the day.
didn’t your mother tell you?
She did, so I am asking you,
also the home feels so sad,
doesn’t look like a wedding home.
the home where the girl
goes from it becomes sad,
so does the heart.
Have all the guests left?
Long time back.
will you eat something?
No, I don’t want to meet anything.
Maheen’s grandma,
she came so before the wedding,
she should have stayed after too.
what will she do living here?
That is the wedding
home now honestly.
I got free from my
responsibility with peace of mind,
they had to make
the arrangements.
Arrangements for what?
Brother took 
2 days to the reception
but still, it was sudden for them,
there is an issue.
Should I make you tea?
no, I won’t like it if you make tea.
Yes,
Mahi is not here to care for you,
but don’t worry,
she will visit often.
This is the advantage
of marrying in the family.
I think Umar won’t be the type
who would put restrictions on his wife.
You are Frank with him too.
Umar?
he is no stranger for you,
you can go meet Mahi when you want
not considering it her in laws home,
but her uncle’s.
Everyone was up,
I think they slept early.
You come Umar, come.
except for Maheen.
Najia was saying 
she is crying continuously.
Look Umar,
the thing these people think,
let them think that.
I am not saying
it cause I will come across as a liar,
I am saying it because
papa and aunt 
will lose their peace,
they will consider
themselves as culprits.
Brother, I won’t do
anything like that.
in all this Maheen has no fault,
so please don’t torture her.
Coming to a girl’s life in
this way is painful for her.
Saying anything to anyone will
do nothing for me, nothing will change.
I know this.
are you crying?
you don’t cry,
that is not possible.
Why are you crying?
Tears of happiness,
that you didn’t get a bald fat man?
Or got someone worse,
that is why you are crying?
or are you crying for my heart?
Your heart?
You are the one 
who knows it all,
understands it all that
I am not sad that
you were forced in my life,
I am sad that
she was snatched away from me.
you are really good Maheen,
really pretty, really good.
Change at least.
What is all this?
Please pick it up,
who put it here.
I am annoyed.
Roshni, open the door.
Leave me alone mama
Open the door, Roshni.
You destroyed the room,
what is this anger for?
Get up and fix it.
Roshni,
how long will I do it?
Look, my life is a mess already.
Leave everything as is,
I didn’t ask you to fix it
What are you upset on?
You dressed up and went to
congratulate then on Mahi's wedding,
since you came from there you got
upset and locked the room.
Leave me alone mama.
Roshni,
what is this attitude?
It wont work in life.
You forcefully went to Shahista's home
and came back running.
Mama, stop.
Go from my room, 
leave me alone.
Go.
Roshni,
this is madness and..
and ...
no one marries a mad person.
Yess,
No one marries a mad girl,
I am mad.
She was smart,
she took advantage
of the moment
and the world is not
for a simple girl like me.
The world is for
opportunists like Maheen.
Wow.
Umar.
Umar.
Umar.
They are calling us downstairs,
I am going.
Umar I…
anyway.
Mansoor.
Yeah.
Papa said we will all
have breakfast together.
One minute. One minute.
Where are you going?
I am going down for breakfast,
you get ready and come.
I will also check on the newly married couple.
Najia, one minute, come here.
Najia, no need to joke like this.
What is wrong Mansoor, I am their sister in law
and Umar should also know that
how big of a hand I have in his marriage.
Don’t you dare say
this to them and anyone.
Mansoor?
look Najia, it’s enough.
Listening to your baseless guesses
Umar has faced a big loss.
Now don’t add salt to his wounds.
What loss? What wounds?
I have told you,
I requested you, follow it.
The wedding was not done
in normal circumstances,
it will take them time to get normal,
you saying this can
make them uncomfortable.
I get it,
mama must have said this.
She doesn’t want
sister in laws to be friends,
cause she never became friends.
If this happens,
who will follow her orders.
fine, think what you want.
I don’t like getting
involved for no reason.
Go have breakfast
I am not going
Let me take my mobile.
fine, go. I wont go to
their daughter in law.
Fareed,
this Razia's silence is scaring me,
she will surely create a scene.
Mama, you always mistake Razia.
If she had to create a scene she
would have done it at the wedding.
You don’t get her
nature for so long,
she is soft on the inside.
She is tough…
You and Mansoor,
you need a chance to
praise your wife, you start.
Hello grandma, hello papa.
Hello. Live long.
how is my daughter? Fine?
Where is that idiot?
Sleeping
Okay.
where is aunt?
She must be busy with work.
She had a new daughter in law,
she should have come to you,
but no, she is busy with her work.
hey, you are still sleeping?
Zakia called us.
Come on get ready.
What happened now?
What is the good news?
We have to take Maheen's breakfast.
You know she doesn’t have a sister,
she wanted to take you along.
But you are lying here.
Come on, 
they must be getting late.
Get ready.
I don’t want to go.
Why do you argue?
Look, when you go,
you will feel better and
you will get to meet her too.
I don’t want to meet Maheen.
Say I have a headache.
Oh God, your tantrums don’t end.
Clean your room cause I wont.
I will go see your aunt, 
go sit.
Come child, come. Sit here with me.
I am your grandma not mother in law,
but Razia is now your 
mother in law and not aunt.
So be careful,
she is mad. Ask me, 
I have been seeing her for 32 years
or ask Najia who gets insulted 
by her every second day.
You need to be careful.
How grandma?
You said that Umar is sleeping.
Is this how you say it?
I swear to God he is sleeping
oh no, idiot,
he is your husband now,
not your cousin,
you cannot say he is sleeping. 
Say my dear is sleeping. Say that.
Yes grandma.
Razia doesn’t like this about Najia,
she calls him just like that.
He got her himself so 
he is responsible but I got you here,
if something happens, 
she will blame me, right?
Yes grandma.
Hey, must be your mother
Really?
Yeah, Farid said she 
was 5 minutes away,
she was getting breakfast with Monis. 
Go now, get dressed.
Why grandma, its just mama?
Oh no, you just got married,
what will your mother think, 
go dress up, do makeup.
Okay, will lipstick do?
Okay, go. Go now.
I am here Umar,
I cannot bother you more.
umar,
aunt and grandma are calling.
I am coming in a bit.
Everyone is waiting over breakfast.
I am not hungry, I wont eat.
Mama got breakfast, 
brother Monis is here too
I will come in a bit.
Grandma asked me.
Smile.
grandma, one more.
Smile.
Yess,
Mansor look it,
It’s good that there was no recording
or we would have known that Umar were 
a borrowed suit to his wedding.
stop it. Idiot.
Zakia, your brother has organized 
the reception after 2 days.
2 days later. May God bless them.
I was thinking of taking Mahi 
with me after the reception,
for the custom.
Actually I didn’t live without her,
so I got sad and couldn’t 
sleep last night.
Zakia, these are useless customs, 
reception is in religion,
we will invite everyone we need 2 days.
You take her today if you want.
Really?
Yes.
If customs get old 
should we quit them?
Everything on it’s 
time seems right.
Yes, sister in law is right.
After all, my in laws are coming 
to meet the daughter in law,
they complain..
Yes, I will take her after reception.
I just said that I take 
her with me, I am sad.
Hello.
Hello, live long. 
How are you?
Don’t worry, I will take 
Maheen to you in the evening.
No, sister in law is right, 
come after the reception,
we should follow customs.
You are saying to me aunt?
No, I can’t do that, it’s your home
Let’s eat.
Hello
Come on. Come.
Umar.
Umar.
Your aunt is here, 
she is waiting.
They are here to meet you,
you go. I will stay..
I will sleep for a while.
Sleep?
Don’t you have to go?
Mama must be 
waiting you told her.
Yes, I did but
I am thinking,
what if I face Roshni 
when I go there.
It’s a weird thing,
I used to go running there,
Roshni use to attract me,
but even thinking 
about it worries me,
if she…
sorry Mahi.
Forgive me. Sorry.
Sorry for what?
I told you what was in my heart.
I am used to telling you everything, 
you are my best friend.
I forgot we have another 
relation apart from friendship,
you might mind it.
No, I didn’t mind.
Honestly? You didn’t mind?
I can say what is in my 
heart to you like always?
Come sit, sit here.
Look Mahi,
my heart has a burden,
being unfaithful to Roshni
I don’t want to hurt you either.
You just say once that
you will forgive anything I say.
I promise I won’t hurt you,
but what can I do?
I am helpless at the hands of my heart.
Umar,
you still love Roshni?
whatever happened,
I can make sure I don’t meet Roshni,
keep no relation with her, 
separate from her,
but man,
what do I do with my heart?
How do I separate my heart from her.
I was worried for my daughter.
Our Maheen is good,
so God gave her a good fate.
he really likes Mahi.
Razia send me to sending her 
Umar couldn’t see her sad,
he said he would bring her.
tell Roshni to come meet her friend.
Yes, she will surely come.
He doesn’t consider me his mother in law,
he thinks of me as his mother.
This proves how much he loves Mahi.
God protect them from the evil eye
Ameen.
have tea, it’s getting cold
You two are imbeciles,
Maheen my friend,
you saw the coast is clear,
you got on to him.
And poor Umar,
I thought he would commit suicide.
But he was just waiting that
I step back and he takes the step.
Maheen, you are a great girl,
I know as much as I know myself.
I know you didn’t come between me 
and Roshni on purpose.
You have no fault,
you were as helpless as me. 
In fact more.
I have no complaints from you,
but what do I do of 
Roshni’s complaints,
her sadness, her tears,
they will increase the burden on me.
The thing is aunt 
Shahista selected me for Nabeel,
that is why they are calling me
so that I can see how they live.
Umar.
Umar.
Umar, I think you 
should meet Roshni.
I should?
yes.
Maybe the burden on your heart 
will reduce and not increase.
I should have told you earlier,
but it’s best 
Roshni tells you herself.
You go meet her.
