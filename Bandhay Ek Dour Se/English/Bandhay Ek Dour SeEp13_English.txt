Hello aunt.
Hello. I am making breakfast,
till then go sit with your grandma,
maybe her anger will go down.
I will help you,
I will roll it and you can fry it.
:No leave it, 
your grandma is already upset
and she will say that I am making the
new bride work in the kitchen.
Why would grandma say that?
She told me herself that you have a lot
of burden and I should support you.
Mama will never say that.
Fine, if you want to work, then make tea.
You know aunt, I can make bread. 
Really good.
I know, I have had bread you make,
or else Zakia has no flavor in her hands.
I don’t know where you learned from.
Fine child, if you are so restless,
tomorrow is Sunday,
I will make you prepare sweets.
Fine.
Go to her now.
Yes Umar,
what did you think?
When are you taking Maheen out.
Wow, is the honeymoon planned?
No, no preparation but
I think tomorrow is a Sunday,
leave for Murree in the evening tomorrow.
What do you think?
Yeah.
No, I want her to prepare sweets tomorrow,
they will go after that.
What is the hurry?
Let her be here for a week.
Mama, I am in no hurry,
she came to me herself. Ask her.
Why?
Yes grandma, I asked her.
Papa, I was thinking we will go in a week,
what is the hurry?
Umar, the weather is really good there.
Yes Umar, stay a day in
Islamabad with your uncle.
There you go, she never misses a chance.
Mama.
I would suggest,
leave Murree, 
go somewhere else,
Naran, Kaghan, Hunza.
Uncle,
its Umar’s birthday day after tomorrow,
we will all celebrate
it together and then go.
Yes, you can’t enjoy the 
birthday outside home.
Wow, we didn’t remember.
Good the one who remembers is here.
Nothing like that,
I am his mother, I remembered.
I was just checking if someone
else remembers or not.
Hello.
The whole day passed and you didn’t call.
I was unwell.
What happened? All ok?
I am not well and after all,
I went to meet Maheen,
so I had a weird sorrow in my heart.
You met Maheen?
Yeah.
I went to talk to Maheen that
don’t be afraid of me and not
to make you sad cause of me.
Look Umar,
I cannot see you sad and worried.
I had thought
when I would be part of your life,
I will love you more than I can,
but that couldn’t happen.
So now I want that at least
Maheen keeps you happy.
Happiness is not something you
can buy and give to someone.
I made you sad,
still you are thinking of my happiness.
I feel you spoke to Maheen,
that is why she was apologizing to me.
Maheen apologized?
Yes.
Then maybe she realized that
or maybe she didn’t
or maybe still in her heart…
I don’t know. Umar, I am unwell,
I will just say that
don’t call or message me again.
Forget me Umar. Bye.
Roshni…
I can never forget her.
Maheen.
Yeah?
tell me something,
how would you feel that
I talk to Roshni right now?
You wont like it? 
You would get upset at her?
No.
See, I knew it.
I was telling her that 
Maheen wont mind,
she has supported us,
she knows the intensity of our feelings.
You just stir the spoon.
Its not easy for you to make 
sweets out of 7 kg. it’s a custom,
so you need to touch it.
Why are we making so much sweet?
Hey,
the locality, relatives need to taste it that 
the new daughter in law made this.
That damned Najia didn’t 
let this moment come,
she made plastic noodles.
After separating the stove, 
she is still the same.
I will send the sweets to Zakia too.
You go and give it with Umar.
I had told you,
Maheen has no objection, 
you were being hesitant for no reason.
Yes, so I will be scared.
Maheen fights with you cause of me,
I don’t want the peace of your home ruined.
What peace?
There is no peace without you, Roshni,
I just want to make amends for what I did to you, 
the false promises,
may someone else fulfill them.
One second stop the bike here.
What happened?
What happened?
First thing is that 
Roshni doesn’t like anyone
but Umar and secondly, stop making false claims, 
along with false promises.
You cannot see me 
become someone else’s.
Only I have this courage.
Roshni,
you have a right on your life.
I don’t want that you 
ruin your life cause of me.
You really want to make me happy?
Obviously.
I want one happiness from you.
Go ahead.
Tomorrow is your birthday,
I want to be the first one to wish you,
face to face.
Fine,
I will come here at the 
same time tomorrow.
Not the same time,
I want to wish you first,
before anyone else does it.
Alright,
you can call. I…
I don’t want to call, 
I want to wish you face to face.
Yes, Roshni,
but how will you meet me 
at 12 am tomorrow.
I can come to my roof
and we have met before.
You tell me,
will you come to 
your in-laws roof?
Yes.
Okay then, this is his new 
habit of not picking his phone.
He comes,
I feed him sweets, 
then I make everyone else have it.
I have to send the 
sweets to so many places.
I don’t know where this boy is.
Roshni, man,
I was thinking that…
meeting so late at 12 am,
wont it be weird?
I have not asked you to do anything 
you have not done earlier.
We have met earlier,
so why are you being a coward now?
Its not about being a coward.
Ahh,
The situation is a little different, 
earlier it was my aunt’s home,
now its my in-laws. 
I have so manners for that…
Your wife is at home and 
you are sitting here with me,
do you have no shame now?
Roshni…
You know what your problem is Umar.
What?
You are having fun.
What fun?
You have a new bride at home
and you are satisfied that 
the old lover is with you.
What nonsense is this?
You are making stupid moves,
did I not tell you that 
Maheen is now your wife,
your home’s respect,
you two start a new life, 
stay happy and don’t call me.
Did I not say that?
You said it. 
I know, you were saying it.
But you never agreed.
You said Roshni, 
I cannot live without you,
I cannot consider 
Maheen my wife.
If you cannot consider 
Maheen your wife,
then why are you considering 
her home your in-laws happily?
Okay, its not that, I am just thinking…
The thing is, you want to 
keep both sides happy
and you want me to take the blame of being the 
girl who doesn’t let you live a happy life.
No man…
You leave me once, so that I die.
What are you saying?
You know I will die leaving you.
We will get separated once and die.
You stay together like this, you will make me 
realize that you will be far for me, I will die daily.
If you like me and don’t want me to go,
then why don’t you listen to me.
I should know that the boy 
who I gave up so much for,
he has the courage to 
do something for me.
You are right, I am sorry.
Fine, whatever you say, 
when you say, 
I will be there. I don’t care.
Serious?
Yes, stop crying now? 
Why are you crying?
You made me cry.
You look good.
Lets order something.
Hummm, Delicious.
The sweets are delicious.
Here, take this, this is your prize.
what is the need of this?
Child, keep it, it’s a custom.
Thank you uncle.
Did you distribute it to the locality.
Yes.
Brother’s driver is coming,
I am thinking of sending it 
across to sister’s with him,
Umar is not home yet or else 
he would have dropped it.
Hey, he should have 
stayed home on a Sunday.
I am sure you sent 
him for some work.
Why would I send him?
Hey, Umar is here. Umar.
Hello.
Hello. Live long.
Ask him mama if 
his mother sent him.
Where were you?
Papa, I had some work.
On a Sunday.
My friend had some work.
You always help friends, 
but never your family.
You knew we had to 
make sweets today,
I had to distribute it at a 
lot of places alone.
Mansoor is sitting with a 
nail in his back from his wife.
He is unable to move. 
I had to go alone.
Where are you going now?
The custom was that 
Umar had the first bite,
go child get a spoon.
What is wrong Razia?
He must have gone somewhere,
you know all his friends.
He stays out half the day,
doesn’t pick up his phone.
Don’t I have this much right being 
his mother that I can ask him.
Its not about asking, 
its about asking again 
and again that I stopped you.
He is your young son,
now will he update you 
on everything when he goes.
Wow,
you are really liking 
him all of a sudden,
you used to question him 
so much if he was late by 2 minutes.
It was different earlier, 
he is married now.
Its not nice to scold him in 
this tone in front of his wife.
Wow, Mr. Fareed, wow,
you even in this age still get 
scolded in front of your mother,
not just in front of your wife, 
but even your children.
I am a mother and only your 
mother doesn’t have rights,
so do I.
Fine, you fight the 
battle of your rights,
whatever I say, 
just pin it on my mother.
I am right,
earlier he didn’t used to 
get up before 2 pm
and he went away after getting ready at 10 am, 
even after I stopped him.
On his way back, should I not even question him. 
This is a weird restriction.
How did you like it?
Yes,
its good.
Okay stop,
when I used to cook earlier, you used to 
have problems that its really bad,
its half cooked, its over cooked, that is how 
I know you liked it. Now you say you like it.
I know the food my mother cooks.
Aunt didn’t make it.
She told me the method,
so it tastes the same, but I made it.
Okay look,
I got a prize for making sweets.
That’s good.
Did you go to meet Roshni?
Okay, aunt was saying that the sweets are good, 
so we can drop it at mom’s too.
But you came so late,
I thought I would call brother 
Monis, he will pick it up.
So, lets drop it.
At this hour?
Tomorrow.
Not tomorrow,
lets go today Maheen.
In fact, lets do one thing, 
we will stay there overnight.
Stay there?
I don’t have such a program.
Look, what is the time?
Its 9 pm,
when will we go and when will we come back? 
So, lets stay there.
But,
its your birthday tomorrow.
We will come back in the morning.
How can we go like this?
Aunt will get upset. 
We will take it tomorrow.
You tell her, I said it.
Why are you saying it?
You want to meet Roshni?
What sort of a question is this?
If I had to see her, 
I would go and meet her,
I wont say all this for you. 
I am saying this for you.
If you are saying this for me,
then I don’t want to stay there at night.
Fine, then don’t ask me to go there again.
Listen,
cant you do this for me?
I will go get ready.
I came to meet her and she is not here.
Yes, she said she was coming.
I will ask Monis to call and ask.
Listen aunt,
did they not make her 
make sweets too soon?
I mean what was the hurry, 
they are weird people,
they should have cared for 
their daughter in law a little.
You know, 
your sister in law,
she looks like someone strict to me.
Yes, she is,
but I know my girl too,
I am sure she created a scene when 
she went there. She cannot sit like that.
I am sure she wanted to 
care for the home immediately.
She can do that later, 
she should care for her husband first.
I mean aunt, this is the time
when the husband and 
wife get to know each other,
stay happy, spend time.
If she gets involved in the work at home, 
this time will pass.
This is great, 
how much more will she know Umar?
They have spent childhood together,
they were close friends.
To be honest, my heart is at 
peace that she is with Umar,
our Umar.
Aunt, I will go home,
I have to help mama, 
there is a lot to do.
Bye.
Bye. Come when Mahi comes.
Yes.
How did you make this 
plan all of a sudden?
To stay overnight?
Actually its taking so long to go,
that we will get really late coming back, 
so we thought we would stay there.
Umar has to go to 
work in the morning
Yes, we will leave 
first thing in the morning.
What is the great thing 
being distributed at night that
you people have to gather it.
Mama,
I took permission from papa. Come on Maheen.
Yes, he would allow you,
did you come here to show your face for an hour?
Your friends took the whole day
and now you will be staying at 
your in-laws cause your wife asked you.
Mama, nothing like it, you are saying this 
without any proof. Its not her wish,
I asked her myself. 
I have some work with Monis.
You have a lot of work nowadays.
What can Monis help you with?
Why? Can Monis not help me out.
Why are you standing?
Get the clothes and the bag too. Go.
What are you looking at me for?
You people have decided,
and you got permission from his father.
You just had to inform me, 
as a custom, so leave now.
I know it all,
he will take him mother and brother in law 
and go out for his birthday dinner.
Like we are not related.
You will see their face 
and celebrate your birthday.
Well done.
We brought you up and you will go 
celebrate your birthday with your in-laws.
We are not related.
Man, you uselessly say…
You people made me wait for so long,
I thought you people might not come.
Its really late.
Yes, we came late and 
you will have to pay for it.
We will stay overnight.
You are welcome, most welcome. 
You will stay too.
Yes.
Wow.
Let me call Monis 
and ask him to come back.
If he had known you would come over and stayed, 
he would never have left.
You call him.
Its ok, I will call him, he will come.
No,
what do we know of his plans, 
God knows when he will come
and you will get bored here. 
Me and her will sit and talk.
He will also sit and talk.
He wont get bored.
Right?
You made this?
This is the start, 
see what happens next.
Now he will celebrate 
Eid there too at his in-laws.
She took him with her, 
she didn’t even think that I am a mother,
don’t I feel like kiss my son’s 
forehead on his birthday and pray for him.
He will be back in the morning,
you can kiss his forehead, pray for him.
The day is to start.
But mama,
she has shown her right,
that she has the most right on Umar,
she will congratulate 
him first for his birthday.
The new year of my son’s life will start,
she will be there, we wont.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Cut It with me.
Its your birthday, how can I cut it?
I cannot cut it without you.
Happy birthday to you.
Hummm,
Here, first you.
No, you first.
You first.
No…
Thank you
for giving me these moments.
I will always have this in the 
treasure of my memories,
because I only have memories.
I don’t have you,
nor you will ever be.
Please Roshni, don’t say that.
I am still yours like I was before.
I love you Roshni.
When I see you,
I forget everything.
A little more.
Errr…
You will have to eat a little more.
I feel…
I made it myself?
Yeah.
No, I didn’t make it myself.
Hey, you are only feeding me.
There you go, he cut the call again.
Again?
It would have been better had I not called.
Give your beloved some shame.
He cant even tolerate someone 
coming between him and his wife.
Even if it’s the grandma or mother.
Shameless, idiots. 
Him and Mahi too.
They got the grandma get 
insulted in front of Razia.
Its all Zakia’s doing.
The way she is, what she did, 
she has taught the same to her daughter.
Mahi, you? Mama didn’t tell me.
Humm,
I told her not to, 
I wanted to surprise you.
Did Umar come or did 
he drop you off and leave?
He is here too.
That’s surprising,
it’s a great surprise.
Had you told me, I wouldn’t have gone 
to watch a movie with my friends,
I would have taken 
Umar along. Umar.
He…
he didn’t feel sleepy, 
so he is upstairs on the roof.
I will go get him.
No, its late,
you go, he will sit there all night long, 
I will call him.
You sleep, I need to chat with him.
Umar. Umar.
Umar, brother is here, come down.
Yes,
where were you man?
I went to watch a movie.
Where were you hiding?
I was on the roof, 
I was walking around.
Why were you calling? 
You could have come to the roof.
Come on.
Lets go.
Mahi, get us tea.
Come, lets get fresh.
