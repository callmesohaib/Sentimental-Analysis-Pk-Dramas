Okay, then fine,
I will come along with you,
I will ask for the proposal later,
I will insult her first.
For God’s sake mama.
Mama,
then I will come along,
her mother should be treated too.
You people forgive me,
I will go alone.
I thought that a woman of the home would
come along it would have been easier,
but your intentions…
Uncle,
I will come with you.
Damn it!
Umar, what happened?
You called me in such an emergency.
Umar?
Brother Mansoor, I have found
the answers to all the questions.
The question that you put in my heart.
I have found out.
What have you found out?
That I am not entangled in Roshni’s love,
but in the promises I made,
I don’t have fear of going away from her,
I am afraid of the blame of being
called unfaithful and a cheat.
I don’t wish to live with her,
but I care for her.
I feel that I made a promise to her,
if I go away from her, she will take her life.
I don’t love her.
This is not love.
This is just a burden,
that suffocates me.
Who do you love?
Did you find the answer to this?
The answer is in front of me,
I kept on looking away,
I used to feel ashamed.
I claimed to love a girl,
made her wait for me,
then I fell in love with someone else.
But brother Mansoor,
I cannot take it anymore,
I want to get rid of this burden.
Umar, I was waiting for this moment,
go and tell Maheen
that you have learned
the difference between illusion and love.
How can I tell Maheen?
What will she think about me?
She knows everything about me and Roshni.
She knows my madness.
She will think that the things
I used to say to Roshni,
I am saying to her.
How will she believe me?
Umar, you have wasted a lot of time,
in these ifs and buts.
These useless misconceptions,
don’t waste time in those,
go and tell her.
Should I?
Yes, right now, this very moment.
And Roshni?
Its clear to you who you love,
then also decide that
who do you care about the most?
The one you decide about do think about it,
that the one you care about, is she worth it.
Roshni is not worth this.
She is not worth it.
I agree that her emotion is real,
she must love me,
but the people I love,
who are attached to me,
if she cannot love them,
then I cannot include her in my life.
Then go.
Go right now to Maheen and tell her.
Take out the fear from inside you.
Go.
Thank you brother Mansoor.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What happened, papa?
Is everything ok at home?
Mama.
What happened to you?
Why are you crying?
Someone tell me, what happened?
We have fixed the proposal
and also the wedding date.
After four days you
and Roshni will get married.
What?
So soon?
You also fixed the wedding date?
What sort of people are they?
They couldn’t tell us before coming.
You knew when those people are coming,
you should have stayed at home,
but you cannot stay at home.
They are weird,
they didn’t even meet me
and nothing else,
and my mother is the most weird,
that is so tired of me that
she met them for the first time,
and fixed the date of the wedding.
They must not want to meet you.
The way we are getting this
wedding done with a dead heart,
they must be doing so as well.
And you leave everything,
you are happy,
your wish is complete.
Now what do you want?
Should we dance over this defamation?
Mama, there was no need to be so hasty.
You failed all my planning.
Right now I had to get
Umar agree to so much,
make him agree to a lot of my conditions.
Now how will I pressurize him
after the marriage?
Roshni,
I don’t see any signs of you
wanting to live in that home.
Look,
you have fallen in love,
take your respect and leave.
If this is how you will behave,
you will come sit on this door.
See this,
come to your senses.
Congratulations,
today God fulfilled your heart felt wish.
True love never loses.
What are you acting about, now?
You were dying to send the proposal till yesterday.
What else?
He has made such a face, like we are forcing him.
Maheen.
Yes, I am here.
What happened?
What was the haste to do all this?
You were in a hurry,
you wanted that all this…
I wanted it?
I feel you wanted it.
Yes,
I wanted it.
I want it.
Why?
Why?
Tell me.
Because,
I don’t want
that I am blamed that I became a hurdle between someone.
Because I don’t want you to think I forgot our friendship.
You thought about yourself,
not me.
You want to sit on a tower of greatness
so that everyone else comes across to you as small and below standard.
This is what you want, right?
What did I do now?
Everything went wrong, brother.
This matter got out of my hand.
Nothing has got out of hand till now,
how long will you keep what is in your heart, in your heart.
Go and tell Maheen
that your love she is her, not Roshni.
Go and tell her to stop all this from happening.
They will fix everything, you go and tell them at least.
And Roshni?
What is her fault?
You are still worried about Roshni?
Stop worrying about her. Think about yourself.
Think about yourself and Maheen.
Brother Mansoor, you know the condition in which I and Maheen got married.
It was to save the respect of the family.
So does Roshni not have a family?
Does she not have a mother?
I know I don’t love her.
I have a lot of complaints from her,
but we were together.
Her poor mother has made preparations for the wedding.
What is your problem Umar?
You cannot do this.
You cannot do that.
What do you want?
I can do a lot.
I want a lot,
but for whom?
For Maheen.
Who is happier than me on my proposal being finalized?
did you see?
What do I tell her?
That I love her?
Even though she doesn’t love me.
And you are sitting here and crying, quietly.
What can I do? Fight with her fate?
Hey, my sister doesn’t have a bad fate.
The one who has a bad fate is the one who is losing my sister.
At least, I cannot sit here and see the show, mama.
So, like you going there and asking questions will stop the wedding?
Hey, let it not stop,
my sister is not so low, that she falls at their feet,
but I will not let Maheen stay there any further.
Don’t do that, Monis,
or else people will talk.
Everyone will say what Roshni is saying,
that Maheen herself didn’t want to live with Umar,
so that she is on the forefront of his wedding.
What respect will we have?
Hey man, respect. Respect. Respect.
Why will the burden of the respect of the family be on my sister’s shoulders?
Does she not have a life herself?
But I have decided,
no matter what the world says,
I will not let my sister’s life be ruined,
I am going to get her.
Monis, don’t be hasty, talk to Umar and your uncle, first.
But Mansoor you had said…
I was not wrong,
what I thought was the truth, turned out that way.
Umar accepted that he loves Maheen.
Really?
Did he really say this?
Yes,
but he took too long to say it.
Or maybe you were too hasty.
No, no,
nothing has been lost yet.
No,
you cannot do this.
I know you.
When Umar doesn’t have the courage,
then you are our father.
Its your upbringing that Umar’s killing his heart and not being selfish.
He had sympathy for Roshni, not love
and now this sympathy is even more than before now.
Hello mama.
Hello.
How are you?
Why do you care?
You go and prepare for your second marriage.
Hey, if everyone is agreeing to what I said,
then is everyone doing me a favor?
What did I do?
Am I a criminal,
did I commit a murder.
In my eyes, you have murdered,
a murder is not just of a human
its of relations and emotions too.
You are a criminal and a sinner too.
Don’t you dare,
don’t you dare try to explain to me that the second marriage is not a crime.
Islam has given permission for it.
When you know about this, why would I repeat it?
Okay.
Then do one thing,
get your father married for the second time,
if you have permission,
then he too has permission.
What are you saying?
Really?
You are scared about getting your mother married for a second time,
what about that girl?
Did you think about her once?
Did anyone think about me ever?
What I feel or what I want?
I came to convince you,
but now I feel that no one will ever be happy with me all my life,
and nor can I ever stay happy.
Yes, yes, you will continue to cry.
You will never be able to stay happy after your second marriage.
Thank you.
Tell me something,
what do you talk to Umar till late night?
Why don’t you tell me anything?
There is no point in telling now.
Are you instigating him to get married again?
Why would I do that, Najia?
I tried my best to make him understand,
that he should stop.
But…
But what?
Maybe he would have stopped,
or stopped all this from happening,
if Maheen wished the same too.
If the one in front of you has already surrendered or someone gives up their right, themselves,
then how can someone fight their battle for them?
Fine,
then, let me talk.
I will break Maheen’s silence.
Fine,
give it a try.
Hello,
Umar, did you talk to your papa?
No Roshni,
there is no point in talking.
Why is there no point in talking?
Umar, I had told you earlier
that I cannot live with people 
who don’t like me.
You will have to live, Roshni.
Everyone dislikes me too,
but where will I go leaving them?
Do what I have told you,
get the top portion vacated, we will shift there after marriage.
Umar, we will have to do this quickly,
we don’t have a lot of time.
This is not possible, Roshni.
I cannot put my brother and sister in law out of their portion for my sake?
Why is it not possible?
Am I the only one left to make all the compromises.
Look Roshni…
I am doing you a favor, Umar.
I am marrying you.
Is this not enough that you want more sacrifices from me?
What did you say?
Favor?
Yes, I am doing you a favor,
you are someone else’s husband,
I am accepting a distributed man.
Your parents ruined your life,
I am supporting you.
Instead of worrying for me, you are worried for the world.
This is the limit!
Hey, you get your checkup done, regularly, right?
Yes mama,
by the grace of God everything is fine.
You have to go alone,
if I was capable,
I would have taken you to the doctor myself.
You will see,
how soon God will give you health.
Then whether it’s a grandson or granddaughter,
you will play with him all around the home.
God willing.
You will see,
God will get good times…
careful child…
I will play with him myself by the will of God.
I forgot to ask you,
that what room do we set for Umar.
Obviously, we don’t care about Roshni,
she can live anywhere, but Umar has to live with her,
so we will have to think something for them.
Why do you worry for him so much?
He will get new brides often,
so will we get him new rooms every time?
To hell with him,
he can live anywhere with his wife.
No, I was just saying…
I was thinking that you have become smart,
but you are still stupid.
What was the need to say this in front of Maheen,
she would have minded it so much.
Sorry, I will be careful in future.
Sorry is not the solution for everything,
think before you speak.
I am doing you a favor, Umar.
You are someone else’s husband,
I am accepting a distributed man.
Your parents ruined your life,
I am supporting you.
Instead of worrying for me, you are worried for the world.
This is the limit!
Why are you crying now?
No.
You may hide your tears,
but your empty eyes tell everything.
Why don’t you say that you love him?
How long will you hide it?
And him…
if you hid it from him,
at least accept it yourself.
What acceptance sister in law?
I am being embarrassed,
because I am trying to show my ownership on someone else’s thing.
Someone else?
He is your husband
and you should have made him realize this.
You don’t make someone realize,
they realize on their own.
I realized it.
And you don’t even ask for love,
you get it.
I didn’t get it,
Roshni did.
No,
at times you need to ask for love,
just like a prayer.
If prayers are made with intensity and power,
they get accepted.
Look at me,
the doctors said no to me after seeing all my test results,
they told me it won’t happen.
But what happened?
God’s blessing won,
you too ask for it once.
You asked for something for yourself in your prayers,
how can I ask for someone else’s thing?
So will you live all your life with this burden?
No,
Umar’s love is not a burden on my heart,
I am at peace,
that to get him,
I don’t have to take support of anything.
Neither truth, nor lies.
A person can pray to God,
but not love from a man.
This is not something you ask for in charity.
Umar.
Yes?
I want to talk to you about something important.
Go ahead.
Speak up Maheen.
Its Roshni.
I have to tell you that
I am shifting downstairs in grandma’s room,
this room will be for you and Roshni…
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.
What do you want?
I asked you, what do you want?
How many medals do you want on your shoulders?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What is your problem?
What do I do?
I am asking you, what do I do?
How much burden will you put on me because of your favor?
Speak up.
Speak up.
I don’t have a daughter,
still my heart is hurt.
You always considered her your daughter,
then how can you…
Uncle,
I wanted your permission.
Yes, go ahead child.
Tell me.
Can I go to mama’s home for a day or two.
But day after tomorrow…
Yes child, surely.
Go for a week.
You will be able to rest
and after all,
we are much better now.
Don’t worry about here.
Yes…
Thank you.
After I return,
I will shift to grandma’s room.
Live..live long.
I wanted myself that
she shouldn’t stay here on this occasion.
But I didn’t have the courage to say it.
Its good,
she decided to go herself.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
