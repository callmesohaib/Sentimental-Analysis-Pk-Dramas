Hello.
Hello.
Hey, had I known you people would come too,
I would have made breakfast for 2 more people.
I will make it, 
it will take 2 minutes.
Thank you aunt.
Thank God we had
breakfast before we left.
They ate already.
What do you mean early morning,
its 1 pm, and half the day has passed,
what do we get?
Half fried eggs and dry toasts.
Mama, eat happily,
you know 
Zakia has a lot of things to do.
I have spoiled her by feeding her fried bread,
you don’t mind Zakia.
Where is papa?
Papa? He is busy preparing for the
parties from the morning to evening.
Just like, 
he was supposed to do all this.
We will…
Check Monis,
he left in the morning.
Even Umar didn’t stay for a while,
now Fareed will have to do all the work.
Monis is back.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey Zakia, Monis has grown up,
you should have taught him
some manners to talk to
the guests at home,
Mansoor stood up to say hi,
he left without saying hello.
Hey, you are still sitting?
We have to go to the engagement,
you take 4 hours to get ready.
I don’t have to go to the engagement.
Why not?
Maheen is such a good friend of yours.
She is not my good friend,
she is cunning.
Okay stop it,
don’t be so stubborn, get up.
It’s the neighbors and then,
this is the time when
girls should be visible.
Now see,
your friend Maheen got her
roposal the same way,
when she went to
Muniza’s Milad to recite a Naat.
Mama, what do I do?
Should I do what she did?
Oh God, my child,
I wish God had given you the guidance,
it would have been great.
Now get ready, listen,
you have no manners, no talent,
but He gave you a pretty face,
stop it.
I want that some good
proposal comes on this face,
it will be great.
Now don’t waste time,
get ready on time.
Sure.
Brother,
you went to get Umar.
Umar didn’t come,
but a lot of questions came,
you will answer those.
What is wrong with him?
First you answer my questions honestly.
Did you know about
Umar and Fazeela from start?
Huh?
Umar and…
Yes,
Umar says, he and 
Fazeela love each other,
I came in between them
and you know about them from before.
Still you stayed quiet when my
wedding was being fixed with her.
When did I…Umar…
Umar was…
I was thinking what happened to Umar,
now I get it,
when mama told them that
I was getting married,
he freaked out.
One minute,
what did mama say?
What details did she share about Fazeela?
Look, I don’t know what details mama shared
and what she didn’t, that is not my issue.
The real thing is that I wont marry a
girl who loves someone else.
Will you tell mama, or should I?
No one will tell anyone anything.
You just stay here. You and
Umar are so hasty and stupid.
You don’t have to do anything,
or we will have another issue.
You don’t have to say anything,
you don’t have to go from here. Okay?
I will be back.
Hummmm
Hey, hurry up, 
are the clothes ironed or not?
Is she not ready yet?
Are you calling Umar?
Yeah.
Why?
He is not answering my call,
he should hear what I have to say.
Monis.
Maheen,
you will get engaged, don’t call him,
it will create a scene.
Sister, he should
consider that I will get engaged,
he should at least listen to me.
Why?
Brother Monis. Fazeela. 
Come here.
Sit sit. Come here. Quick.
What happened?
Sit.
What happened?
I want to take your picture.
Take mine too.
You are the bride, you are getting married
and you want to take my picture?
Oh God, the camera is not opening.
Stay here. Look here.
Me?
I will take your picture later.
Hey, get ready quickly,
I have to get ready too.
You are not ready yet?
No, let her get ready first.
I will see.
You ask her to hurry up. 
Hurry up.
What is the scene?
Nothing you go.
Idiot, this is Fazeela,
my sister in law, who is getting
married to brother Monis,
I have a 1000 other neighbors
apart from Roshni, get it?
Idiot, this is Fazeela,
my sister in law, who is 
getting married to brother Monis,
I have a 1000 other neighbors 
apart from Roshni, get it?
Hey, take this. Come here.
Hey, Monis, come here.
Leave my hand.
Come on dance. 
Everyone is watching us.
This. Yeah. Yeah.
Leave me man.
I was joking, I swear
Stop this nonsense, its not what
you are saying right now. Okay?
Its already late, I will tell mama,
I will not marry a girl
who loves someone else, ok?
Hey, shut up idiot, don’t do that.
I said I was joking.
Okay fine, I wont say it, I will not take your name,
but I will not marry that girl either.
I know you two have this…
Hey man, I swear I was joking,
I swear to God, I was lying.
How do I believe you that this is nonsense,
or what you said earlier was nonsense.
Can I swear to you?
Yes swear falsely on me,
so that I can fall and die over here.
I am moving out of the way,
then why do you have to kill me 
and get me out of your way?
Hey man, I swear to me,
lets go to the mosque.
Are you telling the truth?
I swear I am telling the truth.
I lied. See,
Fazeela is looking at you,
I mean sister in law Fazeela,
if you ask me, I will call her my sister 
all my life, sister Fazeela.
Come on man.
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!
I will see Umar, I will go home and ask
him what was this all about?
What is wrong? He came.
Hey,
he came, so he should act like a guest,
see how he is serving food,
he looks like a waiter.
You work like this on your sister’s wedding.
He throws tantrums at his maternal side,
but with his paternal side,
he becomes a servant.
I think he has come here to do something,
he didn’t all of a sudden have a change of heart.
Boys today and their loves are weak,
they start and end quickly,
I am sure he got a grip on himself.
Huh?
He looks happy.
He is not happy.
Hey, will you have something. 
Have this?
No, this is enough.
Hey, what is this?
You should have told me
I would have got you some fresh food.
Have this, I will add it.
No, its enough.
No, not true.
I will leave this here,
I will get some more.
You are so stupid,
you didn’t hear the whole
story and created a scene.
Man, I treated Monis badly.
I have cleared brother’s doubt,
I insulted Roshni so much cause of you.
She calmed down with difficulty,
if you hold your ears, she might cool down.
Should I go meet her on the roof?
Message her,
everyone is busy with the guest,
it’s a good chance.
Umhhh..
Hold this.
Hum,
Don’t eat it all
I saw the stupid gifts they got,
if this what they brought in the engagement,
then the bari will have second hand clothes.
Hey mama,
give and take is two way,
if Zakia had given her son in law a lot in dowry,
she could have complained.
She gave him an ordinary ring,
so obviously they did this.
So what would I have done? 
Given him a gold set?
These rings are given on engagement,
I did the same.
The boys family, they have not much to do,
some clothes and jewelry, that is it.
Us girl’s family have a lot of expenses.
Listen. Listen.
Umar just left Mahi’s room.
Quiet.
What quiet?
Your brother and sister in law got this, 
right?
Lets see what they got.
Show me.
Yes, this one.
Oh no, this plastic jug?
My brother has a big heart,
my sister in law is really cunning,
she wouldn’t have
let him give something good.
I thought you were only stupid,
but you are a donkey too.
What are you saying Roshni,
I am caring for you,
giving you a swing and you are
talking to your future husband like this.
You are not acting like my future husband.
I have seen your obedience,
you cannot marry me in fact
you can marry no one.
You cannot talk about the wedding?
Who are you the girl?
You look so cute, my cat.
Okay listen to me,
number one,
I am in your mother’s eyes now,
I will give her a medication for joint pain,
she will say yes.
Number two,
mama was telling papa that Monis
found a good girl from the same locality,
so papa said,
that you find your second
daughter in law from this locality.
Third and most important that aunt
Zakia and mama are friends now,
the situation is good,
things are looking great,
I will get aunt to say that
there is a cute girl in the locality,
really good, 
get my proposal for her.
Wow my lion,
what if number four
and five have an issue.
No my doll, there will be no issue.
There will be no issue.
Look, today is the perfect day,
since morning, mama and
aunt had no issues, no fights,
everything went fine,
the situation is positive.
Oh God damn it,
hey, people have forgotten
about their blood relations,
its such a close relation
and you gave me a cheap gift.
This is worse than beggars.
Brother Fareed,
what is this?
You are worse then beggars?
Mama, be quiet, you are saying
all that you have in your heart.
Aunt and mama?
Yes, is this a gift to give.
This looks like a dogs coffin.
I ave always given 
you good at all times.
Roshni
We wont even give this in charity.
Razia,
See mama,
you think I am wrong,
even if I give this dress to my servant
she would throw it in my face.
She has no shame.
Mama, be quiet.
Why should I be quiet?
I have been insulted, 
now I will insult her,
I will show the whole family this great dress,
I will show it to everyone.
Stop it mama,
this is nothing to get upset on.
Why is this not something 
to get upset on?
This cloth cant even
be used to mop the floor,
this is what she is throwing in
my princess like daughter’s face.
Razia, what did you do?
You should have thought of the family.
What is this Razia?
You should have thought
about it before giving such a gift.
No, aunt, I like it,
I will wear it, you don’t get upset.
You be quiet.
First, let me fix your mother.
Okay,
so Zakia, this dress,
this is a coffin for dogs,
and no one would give this
in charity for their servant
and this cannot be used
to mop the floor and yes,
the people who give this gift
are people whose blood is white.
This is what you said?
Stop it Razia.
Its your fault.
You be quiet,
I will tell you who is at fault.
Yes Zakia, tell me,
now you will show this
dress to the whole family
so that you can show them the
worth of the one who gave it.
Mama, stop it, what happened to you?
Yes, this is what I have said,
I am not afraid of anyone.
Come on then, go ahead.
Put this dress on exhibition.
Tell everyone.
Mama I will tell everyone
where this dress came from.
If your memory is not weak,
did you forget?
You gave this to me
on my Mansoor’s wedding.
Mama, stop dwelling in the past,
leave it.
You shut up,
since then I have had this
fire burning inside me.
God damn it, such a blame.
Hey, I have witnesses.
Who?
Both sisters in law, 
try to deny this in front of them.
What are you saying?
What do you want to say?
I had decided I would keep this dress safe
and throw it in your face on some occasion.
Mama, stop it. 
Damn you.
You leave. You leave. 
Yes leave from here. Get out.
Stop it guys.
You get out.
You leave. 
Yes leave from here. Get out.
Roshni.
Roshni.
Roshni, get up.
Get up you lazy bum its 12.
No.
mama, I slept so late.
Okay,
so I kept you up all night? 
Get up now.
Listen,
you have to set the curtains 
and take off the dirty ones.
Get the room cleaned by the maid,
Shahista is coming for 2-3 days.
Your distant relatives are coming, 
you don’t see them for years,
still they come to stay at our home.
So what if they are distant relatives,
she is my childhood friend.
She is your friend, 
you care for her.
Okay stop it, don’t insult me.
I have done half of your work, 
do what is left.
I am going to Zakia,
you know there was a scene at their home late at night.
Yes mama, 
she fought with her sister in law.
Yes. Oh God,
she looks like someone who would fight.
Poor Zakia has bad in-laws.
Stop it mama, aunt Zakia is no good,
her in laws are nice people.
I am telling you aunt 
Zakia started the fight.
Stop it aunt Zakia didn’t start the fight.
You saw her sister in law,
oh God, she must spit poison.
See how she has kept her 
daughter in law in control. Why wouldn’t she do it?
Her husband is afraid of her mother,
he must take up after his father.
Razia has her husband, mother in law 
and daughter in law under her control,
oh God, I think that the girl 
who gets married in that home,
what will happen to her?
You know mama,
her younger son doesn’t look like a 
coward like her elder son. Right?
Hey, how do you know Roshni?
I find him weird, he is 
always in between women,
aunts, aunts, aunt,
these men don’t leave their mother’s 
side and they don’t earn much either.
He looks gay to me,
anyway, I am going you 
take care of the home.
Sure.
Gay!
I thought all would be fixed,
we would be one and 
our issue will be solved,
but…
Oh, that’s the end then,
and that Umar was saying that aunt 
would bring her mother to our home.
Liar.
Don’t say that, he is not a liar.
He lies, then he hides his face.
He made an excuse today,
he will make another one after 
a few days, I am tired of this.
Listen, you tell Umar that
his dream of sending my mother and 
aunt to get your proposal can never be fulfilled.
He goes with aunt 
Razia and ask for your hand.
Yes and my mother gives her a negative 
response and things are over.
Why? Doesn’t your 
mother want to marry you?
Man,
there is a sad story and that is that,
in our family, 
the weddings are done by caste,
or if not that, then we marry in people we know.
Now mama is friends 
with aunt Zakia,
she will convince my mother.
Umar’s mother is a 
stranger to my mother,
and mama’s opinion of 
Umar’s mother is not too good,
thanks to your mother.
She is always cursing her 
mother in law and sister in law.
She has told weird 
stories about her in-laws.
How will all this be fixed Roshni?
Hey bride, you don’t worry, 
all be fine. You prepare for your wedding.
But there is one thing,
if Umar comes again and 
says he wants to meet me,
you will not call me 
and make an excuse.
Roshni…
I don’t want these useless meetings,
there is not point in this.
This Umar can do nothing.
Oh God, I got really late.
Mama’s cousin aunt Shahista has to come,
I have a lot to do. Can I take your phone, 
I don’t have balance?
I will return it.
Hah, no. no. no.
pleas
My lovely ROshni, no, 
listen to me.
Bye. Bye. Bye. I love you.
I want my phone.
Roshni, I want it.
This is the limit,
such an old planning,
since when did she have this poison and 
she was waiting for the moment
I had told you earlier Fareed, 
she is a snake, not human,
the one who bites.
But you said she is naïve, 
she is simple,
now you saw the simple, 
naïve, biting snake.
Stop it mama.
Seeing dramas with snakes, 
you always think of then.
Ok,
you have no shame for what you did.
Its possible her condition was not 
good at the time of Mansoor’s wedding,
that she couldn’t give a good gift.
No but you ruined her 
respect and insulted her.
Leave it mama,
you will see her real respect on 
Monis and Maheen’s wedding.
You didn’t like what I said,
but you didn’t see what she did.
How was she talking with my dress in hand,
I had this thing hidden 
in my chest for so long.
Oh God, so patient.
Fine,
whatever happened was not good, 
we should act like elders,
it’s the matter of our child, 
its our daughter.
Fareed, you are right.
I should have waited till Monis’ wife,
I should have given his wife this dress, 
like she gave to my Mansoor.
Like you gave great things to Mansoor’s wife. 
It was all second hand.
It was great mama, really great.
if Umar comes again and 
says he wants to meet me,
you will not call me and make an excuse.
I don’t want these useless meetings,
there is not point in this. 
This Umar can do nothing.
Why are you not getting tea?
The stove is not open?
Oh, I think there is no gas.
Okay, then tell Monis to get it from the 
market and also get something to it,
or she will insult me by saying 
I sent her away just like that.
Like always. Hurry up.
Brother Monis.
We will meet in the evening.
Who are you?
Who Umar?
Who gave you my number?
Yes,
thank you so much,
don’t bother.
Hey if you are that free,
then take your grandma 
who has a 1000 diseases.
Mama, who was it? 
What happened?
Hey, that Zakia’s sister in law’s son,
the one who is always around women.
I told you he was cheap.
Did you see how he was 
acting on the engagement,
he was going crazy dancing 
and playing the drum. He is useless.
Yes mama, you are telling me 
his greatness, what happened?
Leave it,
he was getting free 
with me for no reason,
saying aunty, we have doctors,
you get your joint pain treated.
In fact, I will take you, see him.
He doesn’t know me, 
today he called me.
Awesome.
Mama, this is his sympathy, 
you scolded him for no reason.
Stop it,
I know the sympathies of such men, 
that is alive for women.
Also, in our Islam a woman is clearly told
to treat strangers with tough tone,
so that they don’t dare again.
Look at him, he didn’t 
care for my age, he is after me.
Damn it mama, 
he is the age of your son.
In my eyes, not in his.
I saw him at the engagement,
he was roaming around me.
He was making excuses to talk.
You eat this, you do this, 
I know such men well.
Oh God, what time is it, 
boys don’t leave married women.
Tsk. Tsk. Roshni,
I have thought,
where ever I go, 
I will not wear bright colors,
nor put on dark lipstick,
people are mistaken for no reason.
I told I don’t want to meet you.
What are you punishing 
me for Roshni? What is my fault?
Fault?
Umar, your fault is that in attempts 
to fix everything, you are ruining it further,
what is messed up, 
you are messing it further.
Now what was the 
need to call my mother?
You have any idea 
how upset she is.
I was trying to ensure that 
her heart melts for me,
you had switched off your phone.
Umar,
you were melting her heart?
Everything melted away.
You know there is one thing,
you can do nothing,
you couldn’t convince 
your mother for me,
you couldn’t fix the fight 
between your mother and aunt,
nor are you capable of coming in and asking for 
my hand yourself so that my family says yes.
You can’t find a job.
Roshni, don’t say that.
Okay, tell me something, 
if I remove these issues, then?
then do it,
I will meet you after that.
Umar, I am not that cheap that 
I waste myself in your cheap love.
Roshni.
Roshni, see who is here.
Umar, I am going,
please don’t call me, don’t message 
me again and again. Please.
Bye.
you are still the same, 
beautiful and smart. What is the deal?
You are the same, 
you have not changed.
Hello.
She has grown so big,
you were this small when I saw you.
Mama, where do I keep this?
Come inside.
Hello.
Hi, I am Nabeel.
Roshni.
Meet ZUbaida.
How are you aunty
How are you?
I am fine.
He has grown good.
Yes.
Will you stand here, come inside.
Yeah.
You fix food.
I will take it.
No, I am ok, I will take it.
Will you have something? Tea or coffee?
Coffee.
Fine.
I love chicken.
Eat well.
I got fresh bread, you want some?
Yess.
Ask Nabeel.
No aunty, thank you, I am good.
give him kebabs, go.
Kebabs, home made.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello, hey Maheen, come have food.
No aunt, I ate. I wanted to talk 
to Roshni, I want my phone.
Yes, my phone battery died,
I will return Maheen’s phone.
Come Maheen, 
I will give you back your phone.
She is really pretty? Who is she?
She lives in our neighbors, 
she will get married soon.
Yeah;
Here you go, your phone,
I was coming to return it.
You insulted me in front of the guests that
I take your phone and use it, 
are you a friend or foe?
I didn’t mean it like that.
Taking the phone is an excuse,
I wanted to tell you, Umar came,
he is really worried, 
he was asking about you.
What is new in that? He is always worried 
and I am tired of hearing his worries.
I have a 1000 things to do. Look,
I have guests over, 
you will have to leave.
One more claim.
Till I am not successful in my mission, 
I will not call you or message you.
Thank God I am free.
I will bring my proposal to your home, 
wait for me.
I am useless that I wait for you.
Hey.
Hey,
you are back.
Yes, I was actually getting bored 
with mama and aunty,
and God knows how many 
more relatives they wanted to visit.
so I made an excuse and came back
So you made an excuse, 
you didn’t go out.
I did.
What is there in the city to see, 
so I came home.
So is there something 
worth watching here?
At least I will get tea made 
by your hands here.
