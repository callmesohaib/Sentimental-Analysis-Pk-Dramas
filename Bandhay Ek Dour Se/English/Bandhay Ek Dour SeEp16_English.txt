What happened Najia?
Do you have fever again?
Am I am kid that I will cry on having fever?
Then?
Did mama say something?
Yes.
What did she say now?
Have soup, have herbal tea,
take your medication,
should I boil eggs for you,
why didn’t you wear sweater?
Is this what she said?
What is there to cry in this?
Oh, so these are tears of happiness.
This is what I am crying about that
she said all this to Maheen and not me.
Like she is the one who falls ill
and I am nothing.
Man, why do you go downstairs?
Yes,
imprison me in these two rooms,
I don’t like going downstairs with
my damned face and increasing her BP.
If I don’t go, then she questions,
she doesn’t meet, she doesn’t say hello.
If I go, then seeing me,
she shows love to Maheen.
I ask, have I never fallen ill?
She has never showered love like this to me.
Okay, you come sit here.
Come. Come, please.
Okay,
I asked you, right?
I took an off from the office cause of you.
Okay, tell me, should I take you shopping.
No.
Can I take you to your mother’s?
Not at all.
If I go there, she will see me
and realize I am not happy,
and then her sarcasm,
see the result of a love marriage.
Okay, let’s go out somewhere.
Yes, I will take you for a movie.
Roshni.
Hey, Roshni.
Where did you go?
Roshni.
Roshni.
Where are you going?
I am going to watch a movie with Maheen.
What happened?
You have doubts again?
Come with me,
see for yourself that Maheen is with me.
I am not doubting it.
If her in-laws are so strict,
then why is she doing this
and giving them a reason?
They will say that the friend comes
and takes her to watch a movie,
that too hiding from the in-laws and husband.
We are not going secretly,
the husband will be with us.
Oh God,
when the husband will be there,
then why are you going?
What do you have to do between them?
Mama, her husband is also stubborn and egoistic,
he doesn’t talk properly to her.
So poor Maheen asks me to come along,
she will also enjoy it.
After all, her husband will go somewhere
else after the wedding, Maheen has to shop too.
Roshni,
whether he is stubborn or egoistic,
he is her husband,
she should compromise with the situation,
I don’t understand
why Maheen is dragging you in between.
If he minds, then?
Objection, one after the other.
The deal is that you doubt me,
that I take Maheen’s name
and go somewhere else.
Now the husband and
wife will pick me and drop me back,
will you be satisfied then?
If I tell you the right thing, you argue with me.
Neither you or Maheen have a brain,
after all, girls of today,
they have no brains, nor they listen.
Do what you want.
Hear one thing out clearly,
I will also pray a lot for your wedding.
I hope you get married soon,
so that I am at peace.
Move now.
Amen.
Bye.
Maheen,
why are you not ready yet?
You said you would come by 5, it’s just 3:30.
Well you don’t have to dress up that much.
Give this to me. Come on, give it.
I thought we have to pick Roshni
and if we are going
we will say hello to aunt Zakia, okay?
Here, done.
Come on.
Thank you.
You are being sarcastic?
I am thinking you.
Okay, go, hurry up.
Oh, who is calling?
Hello.
Yes, hello, how are you sister?
Yes, yes.
What?
No, nothing like that, I feel that…
listen to me.
Hey sister,
 I think there is some confusion.
Hello?
I don’t understand,
where all will this girl get me insulted.
Tea.
Thank you.
Listen,
don’t tell anyone downstairs that 
we are going to watch a movie.
Okay,
I was thinking of asking Umar…
I could hear voices from downstairs Maheen 
and Umar are planning to go watch a movie.
Just leave it, it’s different with them.
They are extra special.
She is making an excuse of having flu 
and making everyone take care of her,
if she goes no one will say anything,
but if we go everyone will insult us 100 times.
First they will say I stopped my husband saying I am unwell 
and then I took you out to roam around.
Ok tell me what do you want to wear,
 I will iron it.
Some good pant and shirt.
Monis.
Monis.
Yes mama.
Monis, call Mahi,
heard she came and left from the lane,
she didn’t even see how her mother is.
how is this possible?
Yes, that is what I am thinking.
Roshni’s mother was saying that she came, 
took Roshni and the three of us went to watch a movie.
Now call them and find out that 
when they come back after the film,
will they stay, have food and go,
if yes, I will cook something.
Obviously, if they come they will stay.
Mama, all this doesn’t seem strange to you?
Those two took Roshni for a movie.
She is her childhood friend.
Still mama, when she comes talk to her,
you know Umar is weird and these things matter.
Aunt might raise an issue on these things.
You are right,
when she comes I will talk to her.
But call her,
if I have to cook something, 
then tell me on time.
Are you happy now? Are you at peace?
Yes, completely at peace,
that she sat with you with her right in front 
and I was sitting in the back seat.
Now she will sit in between us during the movie.
No, two tickets, she will shop.
What happened Maheen?
Listen, should we get something to eat…
one minute. One minute, isn’t that Umar?
What happened? Was it Umar?
Man, I don’t know,
 maybe, I didn’t get who it was.
What do you mean you didn’t get it?
 You came running, did you not see?
Hey, the show tickets will end, 
it’s a good movie, we won’t get it later.
Come on lets go.
Fine, but…listen.
Yeah. Yeah.
Lets eat something, I am hungry.
Can I say something, that was Umar,
I saw someone with him, 
but it wasn’t Maheen, I saw a glimpse.
I don’t know they were talking downstairs…
Its good you got me out here, I feel better.
I always say the right thing to you,
 if you agree to me.
Yeah, yeah.
I had told you that was Umar,
 you don’t listen to me.
Maheen.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Sit.
See how we raided.
We ruined your movie date, right?
Where is Umar?
Umar, aaa, he dropped me and left.
Dropped me and left, meaning?
He had some important work suddenly,
and if we would drop me home,
it would take a lot of time 
so I asked him to drop me here,
so I will shop till he comes back.
But Umar was…
okay fine,
you come and watch the movie with us. No?
No,
sister in law, I have to leave, I was going.
One minute, you just said you are waiting for Umar, 
you have to shop, now where are you going?
Umar,
messaged that he will get late 
so I am thinking I will go home,
I will see aunt too, or else it will be late.
You people enjoy.
Maheen, go with us, eat something.
No, I will go. Home.
I will meet you at home.
Maheen.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
She could have gone with us,
 she should have eaten and stayed.
I don’t know what these people are doing.
Maheen, stay, go with us.
Sister in law, next time.
Is this something smart done by Umar, 
he left her alone here.
If we had not come,
 then what would she have done.
What is Umar doing?
What is this nonsense?
At least you should have let me enjoy the movie. 
The interval started and you got me out.
One minute, I told you the whole issue.
They didn’t see us and you said Maheen made an excuse,
 so why did we come out so quickly.
Thank God they didn’t see us,
the problem is brother Mansoor 
was somewhere over here.
When Maheen messaged me,
I didn’t step out then cause I feared meeting 
brother Mansoor and sister in law with him.
Its my fault I messaged brother Mansoor 
that I am watching a movie with Maheen.
What is this nonsense Umar?
The issue is,
that poor Maheen stepped out cause of this,
 she is waiting downstairs.
Poor thing?
Don’t you know why this is happening 
and cause of whom.
What do you mean?
She told aunt Zakia that
 I didn’t come to meet her,
and your brother and sister in law 
here also has Maheen’s hand in it.
Roshni, don’t think that, 
come on come please. Come.
So much wait,
you are cold as ice, are you ok?
Yes,
I didn’t know when stepping out of 
the house that the weather is cold,
so I didn’t keep a sweater.
I will get a shawl for you.
Umar, will you have tea?
No thank you, we just came to say hello.
You people now come as guests.
I will get the shawl.
I am sorry man,
I didn’t realize you stood there in the cold, 
now please don’t fall ill, please.
I won’t.
Here, put this on.
Okay, Maheen lets go.
Bye mama.
Mama is calling too. 
I am waiting in the car.
Okay son, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Mama, I wanted to talk to you.
Go ahead.
If you talk to aunt, 
brother Mansoor or anyone at home,
don’t tell them that Roshni was not with us.
That’s what I wanted to tell you too,
that when you know your 
mother in law doesn’t like all this,
then why did you take Roshni along?
Actually…
Look, a mother in law doesn’t like
 a daughter in law going to her mother’s
or her son going to his in-laws often, 
and here you took your friend along.
This was the first time mama.
First and last time, ok?
Go now, Umar is waiting.
Bye.
Bye.
They are all standing here.
Umar,
come upstairs, I want to talk to you.
Hello brother Mansoor.
Hello.
He will investigate, what do I do?
I am embarrassed myself,
even my lie was caught,
 what will they be thinking.
What was the need to say that
 I dropped you outside and left.
What else could I say?
I didn’t plan anything, I didn’t think, 
they came in front of me suddenly, I didn’t think about it.
You should have called me, 
or messaged me or something.
Okay, go now, you go to the room first.
They didn’t even let me watch the full movie, 
I don’t know what sort of people they are.
If they don’t get along, what can I do?
Roshni,
what new adventure did you do?
What adventure? What did I do?
The boy’s family called and
they said no to the wedding,
I know this is all your doing.
Oh, okay,
so they said no.
but why do you blame me for everything?
I found those people useless,
thank God my wedding didn’t happen there.
I don’t understand what sin I committed 
that I got a daughter like you.
That Maheen,
she doesn’t adjust and survive,
 nor does she let anyone else adjust.
Hey, there was one good proposal,
you drew it away.
mama,
whether it’s a proposal or train,
one goes the next comes.
Get it written anywhere.
Get lost, damned woman.
Hear one thing clearly,
the way you take everything as a joke,
what if your life becomes a joke.
Umar.
You lied to me?
Now don’t deny it.
No, I am not denying it,
yes, I said the wrong thing to you 
that I was with Maheen,
but I was in a little hurry so I ignored you.
But I cannot be ignored easily,
now tell me in detail, we have a lot of time.
What detail do you want brother?
I got an important call, so I had to go, 
so I left Maheen and went.
Then why did you lie to me?
You would have given me a lecture, 
I was not in the mood to listen to any lecture.
You didn’t leave her alone and go anywhere Umar,
Najia saw you going to watch the movie herself.
Sister in law?
Yes,
and someone else was with you.
What?
What are you saying brother Mansoor?
What happened to you?
You are believing sister in law,
you know she creates a scene for no reason.
She was the one who used 
to say that me and Maheen…
leave her. Don’t believe her please. 
I am sure she mistaken.
I convinced your sister in law somehow,
I didn’t tell her about this lie of yours
 or this message of yours,
but you cannot convince me Umar.
What I am feeling,
if it turns out to be true,
then you are not safe.
I am usually really safe in life.
You are not safe.
Mama.
Mama.
Give me breakfast,
I am really hungry, 
I have not eaten since last night.
What misers, they took you to watch a movie 
and didn’t even feed you anything.
They were asking me to eat but I didn’t like it,
the two of them had 
so much tension in between them,
you know we didn’t even watch the complete movie.
Oh, why?
I told you 10 thousand times mama,
Maheen’s husband doesn’t give her importance,
so she worries and calls me.
Poor thing.
Now I don’t know
 if she is the poor thing or her husband.
Why would he be poor?
Mama, look Maheen is my friend,
my sympathies are with her,
but if you ask me the truth,
that man has been cheated,
its an unmatched wedding.
Umar is well educated,
Maheen is FA fail.
Umar is out going and newage,
 Maheen is stay home and stupid type.
Umar, has a pleasant personality, 
Maheen is a crying face,
doesn’t know how to wear good clothes, 
nor can she talk well.
Now you have to suffer in the forced weddings.
She will suffer, the boy won’t.
What’s with boys,
they can get married for 
the second and third time.
So he can get married for 
the second and third time,
God gave him the right.
Yes,
you know there is something great 
about this decision of my God.
You have the bread.
You won’t have it?
I will.
The bread is good, right?
Yeah.
Maheen.
Maheen,
hey, Maheen.
Yes aunt, sorry.
WooI have been calling you for so long, 
why can’t you hear me?
I am going to the neighbors, see the home, 
I mean see the food, don’t act naïve like Najia.
What should I cook aunt.
There is chicken, vegetables, mutton,
 in the fridge, cook what you want.
You cook well anyway.
Don’t worry, I will cook.
Listen,
the maid has not come for three days,
a lot of clothes are gathered, wash the clothes.
Why are you not answering? 
I didn’t give you a difficult task.
No aunt,
I was thinking whether I should wash 
the clothes or cook.
Do what you want, 
I don’t expect anything from that dumb Najia,
it would be enough 
if she can handle herself and her husband.
Okay, I will go now.
Clean everything before mama
 comes out or she will say things.
Yes.
Roshni, why are you not picking my calls,
 nor are you answering my messages.
Is all ok?
What happened, Umar?
Nothing papa.
Is there an issue?
No, what issue can there be?
If you are not well, then go home early.
No, I am fine.
Razia.
Razia.
Oh God, where is this Razia?
Since the daughter in law came,
 she goes out to have fun.
Razia.
Yes, grandma.
Where is Razia?
Aunt has gone to the neighbors, 
that aunt has got pneumonia.
She went to see her.
Wow and even if you get pneumonia,
she wouldn’t care,
she has the pain of the whole locality in her heart.
Grandma, why would I get pneumonia?
You had flu till yesterday,
you don’t get pneumonia
but is this the way that one month old bride is made 
to cook food and leaving the home on her.
Does she not remember her time,
six months,
she didn’t go to the kitchen for six months.
Grandma, she didn’t put such a big task on me,
 I was frying potatoes just like that.
Like I don’t know, I can’t see.
Were you using the washing 
machine in the morning,
if the maid didn’t come a day 
the clothes were not washed,
then what is the big deal?
She would come tomorrow,
 the clothes will be washed.
But no, whether its winter or summers.
She will make you work on the washing machine.
Now see, she has put you in front of the stove 
and gone herself to meet her friends.
No grandma, she didn’t give me any such work,
the maid took two days off, 
so we would had a pile of clothes,
secondly, aunt herself set up the washing machine,
I was just helping her put 
the clothes on the clothesline,
that too towards the end and 
she was asking me not to and that potatoes,
I wanted to have chips, so I was frying those…
Like I don’t know.
Come on go now, go make chips, 
make some for me too.
Grandma...
This Razia is just…
Should I take tea for uncle.
I just gave it to him.
You should have told me, I would have taken it.
When I went to the neighbors, 
was mama saying something.
No,
she was asking where you went,
I told her.
I am sure she created a scene and also that 
I gave you all the work in the kitchen.
No, not at all.
Did you tell mama, 
you washed clothes in the morning?
What is wrong in that aunt?
You have a washing machine,
at mama’s I used to wash clothes with my hands.
Here you have a machine, 
a maid and you do the rest of the work,
grandma knows all this.
Don’t cover up, I know mama well,
she must try to pollute your mind
 by saying that I am not your aunt,
but your mother in law and that too 
a hitler mother in law.
Not at all.
You know when you are not around,
grandma tells not to consider you 
as my mother in law,
nor aunt,
consider you my mother and take care of you.
She tells me that you took care of her all your life 
and I have to take care of you like that.
Okay,
you go to your room,
when Umar comes from work, give him time.
Come on.
Will you have tea?
No.
Are you hungry?
No, man.
Should I put on the TV?
What is wrong Maheen,
if I want to watch TV, I will put it on.
Sorry,
grandma told me to spend time with you.
Okay come here, sit. Come on sit here.
Did you talk to Roshni, I mean today.
No.
You call her please.
Me? Why?
just ask her if she is ok,
 is there an issue with her.
So you call him.
Man, I tried, she didn’t answer, 
she is not replying to my messages.
That has never happened. 
I want to ask if all is ok.
Do it man.
How do I call her Umar, 
what do I say to her?
Man, call her, she is your friend, 
you can call her when you want.
She is not my friend anymore.
Where is your phone.
She is not my friend.
Call her, you call her.
Call her. She is really sensitive.
I don’t know what she minded, 
I am worried for her,
I don’t know man,
what is the issue, why is she not picking up?
Did her mother find out about us?
If she did she will treat her badly.
Try it please.
Umar was lost and worried today.
Yes, he had a long face when he came home
and he went to this room immediately.
Oh, okay,
that is why all day long,
he had his phone in his hand,
some times message, 
some times call, new marriage.
Now you don’t get after her that 
he went to the room as soon as he came home.
I am no Hitler,
I told Maheen to go to her husband, 
sit with him, talk to him, give him time.
You did good.
Obviously the wedding happened suddenly,
it takes time to transition from 
the old relation to the new one
and we need to help them to understand each other,
that’s how love increases between husband and wife.
What do you say?
Our elders used to say this.
Yes you don’t know anything.
What happened Maheen?
She didn’t answer.
Call on her home number,
her mother might pick up 
but we will know if she is fine.
You will argue with me 
why I said this and why I said that,
I cannot make stories, 
I cannot lie, don’t make me do this.
What big task did I tell you to do,
I just asked you to call,
we will know she is fine, 
my heart will be at peace,
its not such a big task, 
can’t you do this much for me?
