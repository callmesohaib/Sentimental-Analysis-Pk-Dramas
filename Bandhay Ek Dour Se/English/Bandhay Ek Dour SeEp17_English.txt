Should I take tea for uncle.
I just gave it to him.
You should have told me,
I would have taken it.
When I went to the neighbors,
was mama saying something.
No,
she was asking where you went,
I told her.
I am sure she created a scene and also that
I gave you all the work in the kitchen.
No, not at all.
Did you tell mama,
you washed clothes in the morning?
What is wrong in that aunt?
You have a washing machine,
at mama’s I used to wash clothes with my hands.
Here you have a machine,
a maid and you do the rest of the work,
grandma knows all this.
Don’t cover up, I know mama well,
she must try to pollute your mind
by saying that I am not your aunt,
but your mother in law and that too
a hitler mother in law.
Not at all.
You know when you are not around,
grandma tells not to consider you
as my mother in law,
nor aunt,
consider you my mother and take care of you.
She tells me that you took care of her all your life
and I have to take care of you like that.
Okay,
you go to your room,
when Umar comes from work, give him time.
Come on.
Will you have tea?
No.
Are you hungry?
No, man.
Should I put on the TV?
What is wrong Maheen,
if I want to watch TV, I will put it on.
Sorry,
grandma told me to spend time with you.
Okay come here, sit. Come on sit here.
Did you talk to Roshni, I mean today.
No.
You call her please.
Me? Why?
just ask her if she is ok,
is there an issue with her.
So you call him.
Man, I tried, she didn’t answer,
she is not replying to my messages.
That has never happened.
I want to ask if all is ok.
Do it man.
How do I call her Umar,
what do I say to her?
Man, call her, she is your friend,
you can call her when you want.
She is not my friend anymore.
Where is your phone.
She is not my friend.
Call her, you call her.
Call her. She is really sensitive.
I don’t know what she minded,
I am worried for her,
I don’t know man,
what is the issue, why is she not picking up?
Did her mother find out about us?
If she did she will treat her badly.
Try it please.
Umar was lost and worried today.
Yes, he had a long face when he came home
and he went to this room immediately.
Oh, okay,
that is why all day long,
he had his phone in his hand,
some times message,
some times call, new marriage.
Now you don’t get after her that
he went to the room as soon as he came home.
I am no Hitler,
I told Maheen to go to her husband,
sit with him, talk to him, give him time.
You did good.
Obviously the wedding happened suddenly,
it takes time to transition from
the old relation to the new one
and we need to help them to understand each other,
that’s how love increases between husband and wife.
What do you say?
Our elders used to say this.
Yes you don’t know anything.
What happened Maheen?
She didn’t answer.
Call on her home number,
her mother might pick up
but we will know if she is fine.
You will argue with me
why I said this and why I said that,
I cannot make stories,
I cannot lie, don’t make me do this.
What big task did I tell you to do,
I just asked you to call,
we will know she is fine,
my heart will be at peace,
its not such a big task,
can’t you do this much for me?
You are like the moon of Eid.
What is this that you take Roshni
from outside and leave from outside.
Think that I come inside,
say hello to aunt.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I will give it to her.
Yes mama?
Maheen is on the phone.
I will talk, I will give you your phone.
Hello.
I am fine.
What will happen to me?
Yes, I am not talking to him,
I don’t want you to curse me.
You must curse me.
Tell him to be patient, forget me,
your home will get ruined and I will get blamed.
Maheen, give me the phone.
Hello.
Roshni, where were you lost?
What is this?
Don’t be superstitious for no reason.
Maheen has no problem, no issue,
take this guilt out of your heart.
Please don’t disappear like this,
I become restless.
You know well I can not love without you.
If I don’t hear your voice,
I am not at peace.
But you two didn’t do right with me.
Come on.
Don’t do this Umar.
The maid is on leaves,
aunt will feel I am running away from work,
so I am going to my mother’s home.
If we had to go, you should have told me earlier,
I would have sorted some work in the morning.
You are worried about making
an image and impression.
You are in a hurry to meet Roshni.
I won’t meet her,
I will drop you and go to work.
Then why are you taking me?
I don’t want to go right now.
You meet Roshni, you talk to her.
Why?
What do I talk to her about?
She sat in front in the car,
so she feels she hurt you,
did bad,
so she is worried and has a weird mood,
you talk to her.
Remove her guilt.
Whatever she is feeling you
understand it better than me,
so she needs you, not me.
You go and me get and convince her,
console her that you are only her’s,
and I have not stopped you
from saying this, go say it.
You feel you are good and
the two of us are bad?
You are worried and
the two of us are happy,
we are celebrating. Is this what you think?
What do I have to say?
Come in the car, I will tell you.
Razia,
I will tell Umar to ask you before making a plan.
You didn’t like it, right?
No, nothing like that,
I just didn’t like the fear
and worry on Maheen’s face.
fear and worry?
Obviously,
had she asked me would I have said no?
She is scared like I will eat her.
She makes Umar say it,
like she is going because
he asked her to go.
This gun of wishes is fired
from a husband’s shoulder.
You have till always gotten me
to agree to everything like this.
That is why!
You know well Fareed,
I used to do it cause of mama’s nature.
Does Maheen fear the same from me
that I had from mama?
Am I a similar mother in law like mama?
What stupid worries are you thinking about?
Instead of asking this question,
why don’t you remove this
fear through your actions,
if you understand the problem.
What is wrong?
Wow, wife of mine, wow.
You don’t need to think this, Roshni.
I don’t feel that you are coming
between me and Umar,
the truth is I am coming
between you and Umar.
You don’t consider yourself a sinner,
you did nothing wrong.
Wrong was done with l 3 of us,
fate made fun of us.
You have memorised it well,
but Maheen,
tell me what is in your heart,
not what Umar taught you.
I am saying it with my heart.
Roshni,
you please stop taking me wrong.
I have never wanted bad for you and Umar,
you two are my friends.
Not are, we were because one
of your friend is your husband
and the other your husband’s second wife.
What happened?
You didn’t like it?
You feel hurt?
Maheen, I should be the one who should be hurt.
You must call me this word similar to a swear.
No,
nothing like that.
If it was true, why would I come here?
You didn’t come here for me,
you came for Umar.
You want to tell him,
make him feel you have a big heart.
You are his well wisher
but if you had really understood our friendship,
respected our love,
and didn’t want to come between us,
then you would have said no to this wedding.
Then maybe,
maybe me and Umar would have
believed your friendship and me?
Maheen, I would have washed your feet
and consumed the water.
But at that moment,
selfishness took over friendship.
Not selfishness Roshni,
helplessness
and friendship.
That was selfishness.
The first groom left your home,
you luckily got the second proposal at home.
Had you said no,
you would have been a
burden on your widow mother.
And if I agree that you were helpless,
then me and Umar too were helpless.
Helpless at the hand of love,
helpless at the hand of our hearts.
I know,
and I can understand.
But you don’t believe it,
you don’t do anything about it.
What do I do?
What do I have in my hands?
What did I have in my hands back then?
What could I do?
The religious scholar was there,
mama, uncle, grandma,
the locality,
should I have said no at this time?
Please,
keep yourself in my place and tell me,
what would you do?
I can do it,
I would have said no.
I can say no everyone for Umar,
but when my mother asks about the reason,
I cannot take Umar’s name.
Because you have added his
name in front of yours before me.
Thank you very much for coming.
Aunt. Bye. I am going.
Maheen, where are you going?
Have food and go.
No aunt,
I am getting late,
I have to sit with mama too.
No,
you sit,
I want to talk to you,
come sit.
Roshni was telling me about you and your husband.
What is the matter?
Do you not have a place in his heart?
Look, it will take some time for that,
after all, you know the situation in
which the wedding happened.
It is possible that this wedding was against his wish.
Maheen,
whatever I am telling you, it’s like mother
cause you are like my Roshni.
Look a woman needs to make a home,
you do what he likes and
don’t do what he doesn’t like.
Yes.
If he is a little stiff, no problem.
Just pray he gets fine.
Yes aunt,
the things you found out,
don’t mention them to mama.
No, what are you saying?
I was just a little sad for you,
so I talked to you about all this.
Bye.
Maheen,
if she got married under pressure,
then he will try to break the rope.
Because those who get married once
because of their parents’ pressure
they surely get married again
and at that time their parents
don’t say anything they say
that we have done what we wanted,
now let him do what he wants.
You take care,
Maheen.
I can say no everyone for Umar,
but when my mother asks about the reason,
I cannot take Umar’s name.
Because you have added his
name in front of yours before me.
Those who get married once
because of their parents’ pressure
they surely get married again
and at that time their parents
don’t say anything they say
that we have done what we wanted,
now let him do what he wants.
Maheen, look what I found.
Look.
I was cleaning the roof,
so I found this. Come see.
You remember this?
I don’t know what class exams…
you were young you came to our home on holidays,
you got all your dolls with you,
Umar and Mansoor really made fun of you
that you are so old but still play with dolls.
You got upset and I think you threw it on the roof.
Now I have cleaned the roof I found it.
Keep it safe,
your kids will play.
Clean it.
This is the doll house from your childhood.
You still have a hobby of playing with a doll house.
A home is not a hobby.
It’s in a bad state,
decorate it a little, keep a doll in it.
No matter how much you
decorate something empty,
no matter how much you clean it,
it stays empty.
You are talking philosophy,
you are really serious, wow.
Is all okay?
Okay, tell me,
did you talk to Roshni?
Did she understand?
I don’t know,
but I understand.
Now I have to make you understand.
What?
You get married to Roshni, Umar.
Live long,
I was about to get up for water.
You are still awake.
Yes, I am not sleepy.
You look worried.
Is there an issue.
No, there is none,
I pray to God, there is none.
I just have a doubt in my heart.
All ok?
What doubt do you have now?
Maheen doesn’t seem happy to me, Monis.
The freshness a woman has in
the first few days of her wedding,
I don’t see that on her face at all.
A sad smile, a depressed face,
she doesn’t even talk to me about it.
Mama, you know Maheen doesn’t like complaining.
My sister is really patient.
Yes, but daughters say
what is in their heart to their mother,
it reduces the burden on their heart.
Mama, she doesn’t want to worry you and
I am sure there is nothing worrisome,
I mean,
who can have a problem with Maheen?
Even if the daughter in law is made of gold,
people have issues with her and
then Razia’s temperament,
she has always had issues with me,
what if she is taking revenge from
Maheen considering her my daughter.
Mama, there is nothing like that,
aunt is not like that.
The weather gets warm or cold in each home,
but these doubts you have,
there is nothing like that.
Okay?
Uncle is there, grandma is there,
they all love Maheen.
On top of that, Umar,
our Umar,
he will ensure that Maheen is not hurt.
Yes, thinking of Umar my heart is relaxed.
Its cause of Umar, I don’t worry.
No matter how everyone else is
I am sure Umar keeps her like a flower.
Okay, I am going you sleep.
You have any idea what you are saying?
I am asking you to marry Roshni,
isnt this what you want.
I wanted this,
but it’s not possible now.
Why?
People get married for the second time,
you can too.
Do it.
The person whose first wedding is not by his will,
can he get married again,
that too my their liking?
Nothing is hidden from you Maheen,
you know it all, about the home, me,
the environment of the home.
You know it all.
Brother Mabsoor is elder than me,
still he cannot leave the home
without mama and papa’s permission,
I can’t even think of marrying again.
What we are talking about here,
this discussion is useless,
there is point of this.
Umar,
you just keep the situation in front of you
and decide what you need to do.
If you cannot face the situation,
fight it,
then give up,
step back.
Stop meeting Roshni
and if this is not possible for you,
then fight,
do what I am telling you.
How long will this go on for?
Shahista,
I have seen a lot of shameless people,
but none like you.
I mean, you are still saying that
I didn’t come to your son’s wedding.
My foot.
You people have any shame?
First you gave my Roshni hopes for marriage,
then your son was being nice to my daughter,
then you people took her to your home,
be quiet and listen to me.
You took her there s PK that
she can see the environment of your home.
Look madam, I didn’t like it then,
but still you did it.
Hey, you should have properly,
formally got a proposal, but no.
Yes, something must have happened,
so my Roshni came running from there,
she must have seen your son’s actions.
Stop it.
You should have talked to me
about my daughter’s proposal,
instead you are giving me
the card for your son’s wedding.
To hell with you.
I will go but whenever I go to aunt’s
I come back with a heavy heart.
There is no one to care for her in her illness.
She has become really alone after uncle.
Yes,
and then God didn’t give her a child even.
Oh God. My poor sister,
all her life she lived a tough life.
She got insulted for not having
a child from her in laws and then
the husband often threatened her
of second marriage
and now she is lonely.
What happened?
Nothing,
just thought of sister in law.
Poor thing.
At least brother Mansoor is good,
he doesn’t curse her or give her threats
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
That’s it, it’s fine.
No,
aunt I didn’t mean that.
Aunt it’s my habit,
I say things without thinking.
Please don’t mind, I didn’t mean that.
The massage is done.
No…
aunt I wasn’t even thinking this.
Mad.
Mama is right, I am dumb.
I don’t know how long she will stay upset for.
What did you say to Maheen
that she is ready to do all this.
I didn’t say anything,
she was saying big dialogues.
I am generous,
I am a sacrificial Godess,
she even said that you can keep Umar,
it doesn’t matter to her.
She said that?
Wl yes, so?
When a married woman tells another woman
that she has no relation with her husband,
what does that mean?
It means one thing.
That is what I am trying to tell you Roshni,
both of us have no such feelings between us,
that married couples have.
What girl would say that?
See, she is telling me that I accept you,
marry you.
Not just marriage,
she is giving you two options.
Either marry me, or leave me.
She knows well that
you won’t go for the first option,
so what is the second option?
To leave me.
Its not like that Roshni,
she must have said this with full sincerity.
Then why don’t you do one thing,
worship her sincerity.
Cause you don’t care or need my love.
You are happy with generosity.
No Roshni, what can be a bigger need than love.
You don’t compare yourself to
Maheen again and again,
it hurts.
It hurts me too,
because I am far behind in conception with her.
Tell me, will you marry me?
No right?
Then accept her second condition and leave me?
She didn’t put a condition, she gave a suggestion,
I have the right to decide.
I will decide on my own.
Roshni, I will marry you,
I will talk to my family.
But not right now,
after a while.
Okay, and after that?
What after that?
will your family agree?
Maheen is your uncle’s daughter,
the whole family will turn against you.
What will you do? Leave home?
Okay,
for a second, let’s believe you leave home,
but after that?
where will you take me?
You don’t have a job,
you handle your father’s business
and he will not give the whole business to
you out of this happiness and my mother,
why would she marry me to you?
A man who is already married,
and doesn’t even have a job?
What do I do, Roshni?
Right now I cannot suddenly convince them,
I can only talk.
Yes, you will talk and then forget for sure.
Look,
it will be fin,
when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
and accept that they made a mistake
and they themselves say that Umar,
marry where you want to.
It will work then.
Roshni, what cannot happen,
Maheen wants that,
you are saying the same thing.
A lot can happen if your goddess
of sacrifice is really willing to sacrifice.
