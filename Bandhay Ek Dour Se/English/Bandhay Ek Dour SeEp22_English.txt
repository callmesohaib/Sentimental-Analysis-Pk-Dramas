What was the need to say this to mama?
I had to say it, so I said it.
We had decided
that we would stay with each other,
whether complete or incomplete.
A lot of people live with us in this home,
apart from us.
You cannot ignore their wishes.
Najia, its not in my hands to fulfill their wishes.
You too don’t have the right to,
or without asking me give
them this permission about me.
Mansoor,
I just gave her permission
so that she doesn’t feel that
I am a hurdle in this route
that wants to stop your life
from being complete.
Now its her decision whether
she does this or not,
or whether you support her
in this decision or not.
I did my work
and maybe with the belief that
me giving permission or
not doesn’t matter,
you won’t agree.
Najia, you put the thought in her head,
now she will pressurize me for no reason.
It was a debt on me.
Mansoor, she is your mother,
whatever she does for you,
you can take it as your right.
But being my mother in law,
she thought something for me,
then it was compulsory
for me to say all this.
Umar.
I am going to my mother’s home.
No,
I…
I didn’t come here to ask you to drop me,
I know you don’t like going there,
I will ask Monis to pick me.
You came from there yesterday only,
if you go again, my mother will get upset.
Let her be upset.
Oh, so now my mother being
upset doesn’t matter to you.
All the obedience was temporary?
Everything was temporary,
not strong enough,
I am going to my home forever.
What is the point of going to her
mother’s house every day?
And look at her manners,
she is not taking my permission,
she is informing me,
that too while standing,
that I am going to my mother’s place.
I asked why,
she didn’t answer and went inside.
She is newly married,
girls get sad for their mother’s home.
What do you mean the heart gets sad?
Isn’t a month enough.
After all, there is no custom that
allows you go to your mother’s home daily.
I will talk to Umar, he has been lenient.
Leave it Razia,
let her go right now,
talk to her calmly later.
I wish you were as lenient in my matters as you are
in the matters of your sons and daughter in laws.
I was only allowed to go once in a month,
after a lot of requests and pleading.
Okay, I will remove this
complaint of yours today.
Since you start competing with
mama’s behavior on everything,
I am being this lenient for you.
I break this rules for you.
So many years have passed,
you have not forgotten this,
the sorrow of your heart has not left,
that mama was a tough mother in law for you.
You complain about it daily,
mention it ten times during the day.
What do you want Razia?
That your daughters in law
also mention you the same way in future,
like you mention mama?
Why are you doing all this now?
Now Roshni has left from between us.
Yes,
she has left from between us,
but there is nothing between us,
just like before.
So what is the point of living 
with this empty relation?
You know why Roshni left from between us?
So that I can be at peace,
whether I get love or not
and when you leave from here,
won’t my peace be ruined?
What will I say to the family?
What will I say when they question me?
Say that she is not happy
and doesn’t want to live with you.
You can say all this nonsense to them yourself.
I will.
Listen, are you really not happy?
No,
I am not happy,
I am not happy.
When Roshni was there and
 you would have done all this,
it would have made sense.
Why are being dramatic now?
What is the problem?
Why are you not happy?
Because my happiness is not dependent on her,
or anyone.
Whether she is here or not,
 it doesn’t matter to me,
I am not happy.
Not with you, nor with this wedding.
Nothing had changed
 with Roshni living here.
So I am the real problem and me
and Roshni kept on thinking
 that if she leaves my life,
then we will be able to live a happy life.
We might have spent a happy life.
Maybe we could live a happy life
if there was love.
That you don’t have for me.
And maybe we would have been 
able to survive if I had loved you,
that I don’t have so we cannot survive.
You are so selfish Maheen.
So selfish.
I have seen this side 
of you for the first time.
I didn’t know you could do this.
You know why Roshni did all this?
For me.
So that I am not blamed,
so that I don’t have any burden.
I know this is my battle 
and I will fight it alone.
Look at you,
what are you doing?
There is so much difference
 between you and Roshni.
I am not as great as Roshni,
but I am not that selfish either.
Look here,
I am still your friend, I am Maheen.
I won’t leave you in trouble and leave like this.
Listen to me,
if anyone asks questions,
I will answer them.
If someone asks you,
say that Maheen is a bad person,
she was not happy,
she wanted to go,
she didn’t want to live with me.
What?
But to do all this,
I will have to go from here.
Look,
By calling Monis will create a problem, 
so please, drop me yourself.
Now…
now, what does the promise you 
made to Roshni mean?
I just…
Maheen, where are you taking 
such a huge suitcase and going?
Do you intend on staying there 
for a week or ten days?
You were saying you 
are only going to meet them.
I had told you, I am going.
Why did you pack so much stuff?
How long will you stay at your mother’s home for?
This Zakia calls you all the time,
if there is so much problem,
then she should come here and meet you.
You please be quiet mama.
You go.
But…
Stop it Razia.
Come soon, child.
Come Maheen, we are getting late.
Bye.
Bye.
She came back just yesterday.
So what?
Its her mother’s home, 
she can come whenever she likes.
Its good,
I had asked her that when she comes this time, 
she should stay for two or four days.
Now both mother and daughter 
will shop for your wedding.
But mama, suddenly?
Actually Maheen said 
something weird with me,
I ignored it considering it her naivety,
that she may be doing it to
 test her brother’s love.
But now that I remember it,
my heart worries.
Why? What did she say?
Nothing.
It is possible it’s my superstition.
She is coming right now, 
we will ask her.
I just hope to God
 that it is my superstition.
What do you think, Maheen?
Leaving the home like this, 
it will all end?
And when you get to your mother’s home,
will aunt Zakia agree easily when you say 
that you want to go to my in-laws,
will she allow you that you don’t go?
She cannot force me.
And when mama and papa find out 
and come to convince you,
what will you do?
Will you say no?
Won’t agree?
When you have to agree, 
what is the point of creating this scene?
I won’t agree,
you don’t worry.
You hate me so much?
No,
not at all.
Then?
Umar,
the reason for not living with someone
 is not that you don’t hate them,
love needs to be there too.
I don’t hate anyone in this world, 
so what do I do?
Marry the whole world?
I am not able to understand you Maheen.
Okay, this is another 
reason for no living with you.
We were not able to understand each other,
loving is a different story.
And if a person doesn’t understand another,
how will they make a place in their heart?
Hello.
Didn’t Umar come?
No, he left, he had some work.
He has been working a lot after the wedding.
Is everything alright?
You people forcefully put 
a responsibility on him.
What do you mean?
Listen, what you just said and left, 
I understand it all.
I mean, he doesn’t have this much time
 to sit with us for a while.
Fear God,
you are taking it wrong.
After marriage a person changes,
there are a hundred things to do,
 ten responsibilities.
You too are getting married,
I will ask you later how many 
times you go to your in-laws.
My in-laws are there, across the street
and if I had gotten a chance to stay there,
I would have definitely gone.
But this is Umar’s in-laws later,
uncle’s home first.
I mean, after wedding has he stopped 
giving importance to his in-laws.
Earlier we used to be his aunt’s family.
Remind him this.
You are thinking too much.
I don’t think too much.
The size of your bag tells me, 
you didn’t come back happily from there.
Where is mama?
she went to Fazeela’s home.
Her mother is planning 
a feast for you and Umar,
but I called and told her not to,
 I made an excuse.
You won’t tell me 
what is going on between you and Umar.
When there is something to tell, 
I will tell you.
I am going inside.
Hello.
Umar,
I have explained to you,
not to call or message me again.
Forgive me.
Roshni, I have to meet you.
Look Umar,
I have closed all doors of my return,
and I have not been able to explain 
myself properly till now and you…
You listen to me.
Maheen has left,
she has left me and gone to her home.
Forever.
She has left my home 
and my life completely.
What?
What are you saying Umar.
She has left?
When you meet me I will tell you.
Okay,
I will meet you then.
Okay fine.
What are you saying Maheen?
Maheen, I am asking you something.
I told you, I won’t go back there.
Why?
What happened?
Tell me at least, what happened there?
Did Razia say something or,
what is her name, Najia your sister in law, 
did she say something?
Tell me.
I will handle them all, 
your mother is still alive.
You are my mother,
that is why I came to you
that I will get a shelter at your home.
But it feels like you are 
not ready to keep me, mama.
Brother, you remember your promise, right?
Maheen, this is not a child’s game,
that you leave home on minor things
and then expect your mother and brother 
that they will keep you without asking questions.
But you said you know if I take such a step,
the reason for it won’t be small,
 it will be something huge.
That is the thing, I am asking you, 
what happened?
What is the reason?
I am not happy there.
I don’t want to live there with Umar.
I don’t want to live,
is this something small?
Yes, its something small.
Look Maheen, till the time we don’t find out
what happened between you two,
how do we agree that
 the reason is something big or small?
I have come here,
and you will have to keep me here.
I didn’t come here to go back.
If you take me out of here,
 you think for yourself,
where will I go?
This is not my Maheen,
this is some other girl.
She has completely changed.
I dropped Maheen at aunt’s home, 
because she asked me to.
Why did you drop her at her mom’s?
when I have said that 
I will leave your life and never come back.
You would have forgotten me in 
three to four days anyway.
Could she not wait a little?
Roshni,
she said that
her decision won’t change 
with you leaving or staying,
whether you love me or not,
whether I love you or not,
she doesn’t love me.
How can someone not love you, Umar?
Someone ask my heart,
 how much I have prayed
that you don’t think of me.
She is thankless.
She got you so easily,
you tell her to ask me
how much I have prayed to make you mine.
That’s
how God writes destiny,
the one you love, you don’t get and 
the one who gets it, doesn’t really desire it.
You love me so much Roshni.
You know you are stupid,,
 you are crying for her.
I am not crying for her.
I am made of your love,
I got teary eyed for you.
Roshni, whatever happens is for the better.
You just think that whatever happened, 
there is something good in it.
Even I didn’t wanted her
 to leave suddenly like this.
It’s a matter of relatives,
I could be blamed tomorrow for this.
But its her wish, 
she wanted to go, so she left.
I feel that all of this is better in your favor.
You got paid for your patience.
Paid for my patience?
What else?
You really like me,
you love me so much
and how you tolerated it,
and gave permission with an open hear
that me and her can live together.
This was your patience 
and you got paid for it.
You don’t have to go away from me,
nor do you have to wait for a long time.
No,
I cannot do this.
I see someone’s home breaking in front of me,
and I celebrate.
No Umar,
I,
I will talk to Maheen myself.
You went to meet her.
Did she say something?
Why?
What happened? Did she say something?
No,
nothing,
she just told me that you came to meet.
Okay.
Will you eat something else?
Mama. Mama.
You won’t say anything to them.
Why won’t I say anything?
They are answerable to me.
I will ask them what happened that
 my daughter doesn’t complain one bit
and doesn’t want to go back home.
Mama,
you don’t want to ask them,
you just want to send me back at any cost.
You got rid of me like a burden earlier, 
now you want to do the same.
I go back anyway possible,
 you will be at peace
that you have fulfilled
 your daughter’s responsibility,
and there,
whether I am dying or living,
 you don’t care about that.
No my love, why won’t I care?
Hey, I am your mother,
I have to find out that what is happening in 
that home that you live and die daily.
Hey, you are a piece of my heart,
 not an orphan.
Let me talk to them,
 I will ask them what is happening.
They…
Brother used to say they will take you like their daughter
 and I will also ask Umar as well...
Uncle didn’t do anything, 
aunt didn’t either.
You be quiet.
This Umar, who acts deaf and 
dumb in front of his mother, I will ask him too.
Yes hello.
Yes Razia.
Zakia, are you in your senses?
No one mentioned this to us,
 neither Maheen, not Umar.
But…
hello.
Najia!
Mama!
Someone listen to me,
 these two have created a new scene now.
Cunning, both of them,
they didn’t let us know anything 
and look at her,
she was leaving after meeting 
with such an innocent face.
She didn’t even tell us, 
what was her intention behind leaving.
Umar, you should have at least told us
 that she is going after being upset.
God knows what she cried 
about in front of her mother about,
that Zakia was getting out of control.
She insulted me so much like 
we are tormenting her badly.
Now why are you sitting quietly?
Why don’t you speak up?
What happened that 
she went to stay at her mother’s home?
What did you do?
Did what?
What did I do?
She doesn’t want to live here,
she went by her own will.
I tried a lot to convince her, she didn’t listen.
What should I have done? 
Tied her and made her stay with me forcefully?
Be a man,
you couldn’t handle a wife.
Stupid!
Tell me, what did she lack here?
She had all the luxuries, peace and comfort, 
what problem did she have?
She doesn’t want anything,
Neither your peace nor comfort, you people forget her.
Why are you acting like a child?
 How do we forget her?
Look Umar, 
whatever the problem is between you two,
we will have you both seated in front of us
 and we will hear you two out. That’s it.
What will you hear out?
What do you want to hear? 
What had to be heard, I have heard it.
The truth is she didn’t like me, 
she doesn’t want to live with me.
That’s it!
Umar…
Oh God,
look at her,
 I used to think she was so good,
and nice, quiet and naïve.
She said all this to my son and left.
Oh God,
my Umar’s heart must have been hurt so much.
I am not willing to believe this.
Who are you we talking about? 
Maheen. Is she a stranger?
She is a child, we have brought her up.
Look Razia,
this is something else
and Umar is hiding something.
He is hiding something.
I don’t understand when these two used to fight,
I didn’t hear a small sound out of their room.
God keep Najia and Mansoor happy,
when they fight,
at least four to five homes in the locality have fun.
Here you go, we have our own sorrow here, 
that we were not able to enjoy the fights.
Wow mama, great. Great mama. Great.
If you cannot face the situation,
you cannot fight with it, then give up.
step back.
Stop meeting Roshni.
If this is not possible for you,
then fight,
do what I am telling you to.
Razia makes you do a lot of work, right?
She has burdened you with everything at home.
When I got married and came to this home,
Razia did the same with me,
she put all her share of work on me.
But see Maheen,
I didn’t leave the ground and run away.
You need to be patient for a little while, 
and then you get control of the time.
I know its difficult to survive with Razia,
that is why Najia has issues
 with her mother in law
but everyone else is good,
and then Umar,
tolerate it for a few days for Umar. Huh?
Mama, I cannot tolerate Umar.
Oh, all men of this family 
are their mother’s beloved,
their dolls,
your father, your uncle and now Umar too.
I will say again, it’s a matter of a few days, 
he will come out of the control of his mother.
See, did Mansoor ran away or not.
You know I will talk to brother and tell him that
 just like he separated Mansoor’s home,
he should do the same for you and Umar.
All the problems and issues will be over.
Then you and 
Umar can live your life peacefully.
Mama,
Umar is the one I don’t want 
to live my life with.
Oh God Roshni, stop it!
You have been sleeping since evening, 
wake up now. it’s enough.
I am getting up.
Your friend is here too, 
you have to go meet her too.
What is the hurry? I will meet her.
No,
you will not go anywhere tomorrow.
Your uncle’s grandson,
they have a party for him,
 you will go with me.
Mama,
I will not go anywhere tomorrow anyway 
and what about Maheen,
she is there at her mother’s home.
What?
What do you mean?
This means that she wasn’t able to get along 
with her in-laws and not even her husband.
What are you saying, Roshni?
God have mercy.
God have mercy, mama. 
Get me something to eat, please.
Yes, I will get something.
Thank you.
Hello.
How are you Maheen?
I am fine sister in law.
I don’t find anything fine
between you and Umar.
What happened that you packed your bag
 and went to your mother’s home?
What can I say sister in law,
at time a person has to make decisions
 that your heart doesn’t agree to,
but the mind tells you that it’s okay.
Maheen, you don’t make 
such big decisions alone.
You should have talked to me, 
we are all your well wishers.
In fact, you are like my younger sister, 
what am I here for?
So much happened and
 you didn’t tell us anything.
what a lot?
A loot didn’t happen,
its just that everyone made 
something so small a big issue.
You left your home,
you left Umar and 
you are sitting at your mother’s home,
its not something so small, Maheen.
Tell me, 
what is the reason for not liking Umar?
There is no reason sister in law.
The situation in which we got married…
we didn’t have time
 to understand each other.
What do you mean?
What more do the two of you 
want to understand?
You did something so weird.
At least you could have spoken to me,
 I would have given you the solution for this problem.
I would have given you such a solution
that the problem would have solved
and there was no need to break the relations.
Hello?
Maheen, are you listening?
Yes sister in law,
I listen to everyone.
Now tell me, 
what is the solution for this problem?
You will find out soon sister in law.
Hello.
Maheen?
