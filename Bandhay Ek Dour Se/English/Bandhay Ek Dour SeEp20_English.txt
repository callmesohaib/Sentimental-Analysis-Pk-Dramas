The question that Maheen asked,
I want to ask the same question with me,
after all , why I am happy,
what is the thing that will satisfy me?
With Roshni as well I have a feeling of crime
and when I am with Maheen as well,
I have regrets.
I thought that I will also make
my night black like you,
maybe, the burden of the
heart will be less by this,
will it be?
Do we get any answer from there?
Brother, I am already worried;
please don’t make me more worried.
I am also worried.
So you can go in your room and get worried,
what are you doing here?
Great,
you have not asked why I am worried?
Any ways,
I am your big brother,
tell me what is the problem?
The same thing,
you still miss her?
The problem is not that I miss her,
the pain
that I can tolerate.
Then?
You still meet her.
This is the problem,
the one who have left you and ran away,
you are running after her.
She is running,
I am just supporting her,
brother,
I broke her heart,
I backed off from my promise,
I betrayed her,
I am very much ashamed,
if I meet her is just because
so that I can wipe her tears,
what should I do?
You tell me, what should I do?
Should I leave her crying,
and is desperation?
When you will stop wiping her tears,
she will not have tears.
I wish,
I wish this will happen,
she will forget me, she starts hating me,
she start thinking that I am bad,
but poor she,
she loves me, she loves the person, like me,
who is a coward and disloyal as well.
If she would have loved you,
she would never be the problem for you,
she would have make your worries goes,
she would have been separated with you.
Brother,  you don’t know anything,
you just leave it.
You are right,
I don’t know anything,
you know everything,
because you are intelligent,
Umar just think about Maheen.
I do think of her,
what do you think that
I don’t think of Maheen,
I do, that is why this is my condition,
that is why I am uncomfortable,
otherwise, why would it
makes any difference to me,
I would have put all the blame on her head
and I would live a peaceful life,
but brother how do you know,
that what is the feeling
when you will get to know that
because of you two people are unhappy,
you are doing injustice to both,
two people are worried because of you,
you tried a lot but still you cannot do anything,
sometimes I think that I swear brother,
I kill myself,
so that the way I live and
die every day, it will get finish.
You are more coward than me,
in fact , always used to
like the bravery of yours,
just forget her,
the person, who is not in your fate,
there is no point running after her,
Maheen is attached to your fate,
so just accept her by heart,
she is a nice girl.
when did I say, that she is a bad girl,
I never said that,
but what will I do for my heart,
that beats just for her,
brother, I cannot leave her,
I cannot live without her,
just pray for me,
that she will leave me,
she will forget me and hates me,
she will let me free from her love.
After lot of courage and thought,
I have made a decision,
it was very difficult
and I was in pain too but.
The decision that you made,
must be right,
I have no rights to have
any complains with you.
Just listen first what I am saying?
what?
I still not think about myself,
I thought about just you ,
and I have taken this decision for you.
For me, Roshni,
what decision?
For your peace , your life
and your happiness,
I have taken the decision Umar that,
I am letting you free from my love.
Roshni.
Now it makes no difference Umar,
no matter if your heart loves me,
but now you are belongs to Maheen,
she is my friend, I cannot take her rights.
what rights Roshni?
She never asked for any right of her.
If she never asked, then what happened?
she do have a right on you.
This is your right to get yourself satisfied,
what I want and what I don’t want,
just leave it.
Mansoor,
if you are thinking like this,
so we will not go.
Yes,
so that you and the other people will
also think that there is something
that I want to hide and
that is why I am not going,
no Najia,
if you think this way,
so it is fine,
you can be satisfied
and you can take this
doubt out from your heart.
Are you sure Roshni,
do you know what are you saying?
I have taken this decision
after thinking a lot
and world do not get agree
for the relation of hearts Umar,
our relationship holds no
 importance in front of this world,
your and Maheen’s relationship is very strong,
so why are we serving this
relation which is nothing?
We just meet once in a week like thieves,
if we talk to each other and
give satisfaction to each other, what will we get?
Apart from being defamed and blames.
Roshni, I told you that
I will take some way out, I will talk,
I just asked you for some time.
I don’t have the courage
to ruin the house of Maheen,
you will be bad in front of your family
and I will be a second woman.
You don’t want that
you will ruin the life of her,
but you want to ruin your life,
you have that courage?
I have to be courageous,
the whole life curse of Maheen
and to put you in pain,
it is better that
I will take on the pains on my head,
it is my prayer that
you and Maheen will be happy forever,
and I know that what I am doing does not
decrease the amount of your pain, it will increase,
but I will be happy no matter
what will happen
so that you will never think that
you have ruined the life of Roshni.
Roshni,
Roshni, please, you.
Just listen to me,
I will take care of my heart,
but if I will miss you ever
or maybe I recall you,
so can I call you sometime?
Can I talk to you,
if you want I will meet Maheen now
and I will talk to her,
can I love his Umar by
heart until my breathing?
Roshni,
why are you testing your patience,
why do you want to see my helplessness,
for God sake,
okay, just stop please, Roshni.
I pray that you and Maheen will be happy
and you will forget me,
Bye.
Najia,
if the reports are against me then?
If doctor said that
I will never be a father then?
Mansoor, why are you thinking like that,
please don’t think negative
maybe it will be a good news.
it can be possible,
anything can happen,
but if Najia you,
please Najia tell me,
will you leave me?
Mansoor.
Please tell me Najia, will you leave me?
You just take the car back,
I want to go back home.
Najia, I am just asking a question from you.
I don’t want any answer from any question,
I don’t want any reports and
I don’t want to show it to any doctor,
you just take the car back,
or I will just get down.
No, I am taking the car back,
we are going back home,
I am moving the car, okay.
I was thinking if she will leave me,
everything will be fine,
why It seems,  that she has taken
my breathes with her while she left,
if her infinite love
will goes away from my life,
so what will be left with me?
Roshni.
You both have come.
Najia,
what happened?
What happened?
Where is Mansoor,
he did not come?
Najia,
Najia,
Oh God.
How are you?
I am fine and you?
I am fine,
you look worried by looking at me.
Worried?
I can see you on your face,
you cannot hide it,
I have seen as well and Umar as well.
Umar?
Yes,
the scare of your heart and your pain,
I came here to finish this scare of yours.
which scare?
That I will take Umar from you.
I don’t have any scare like that,
and how will you snatch Umar from me,
he was never mine,
he still loves you .
And you know all this and
you are staying at his house,
you are his wife,
and you want to be his wife,
what does that means?
That you have the wish that one day,
he will be yours,
so I came here to complete this wish of yours,
you don’t need to wait for now,
I came here to free Umar from my love forever,
because of you.
You are here?
Where were you?
Umar,
what happened?
are you worried?
Look Umar if you and
Maheen have any problem.
Father, why do you think that
I only have this problem in my life,
yes, I do have this problem,
but because of this one problem,
I have so many problems born in my life,
but you should be happy father,
on the day of judgment you
will be in peace in front of uncle,
you are so famous in the family
that your son is obedient,
you said once and
he said yes for the wedlock,
and the future of your niece is secure now,
now it is my problem,
I am concerned about that,
why you have any concern in that.
Umar son.
These are the tears of happiness?
Roshni, don’t do this,
his heart will break badly.
It is already,
he is not happy now,
we all three are not happy,
at least you will be happy with this decision,
Umar and me have thought that
we cannot give you more pain.
I will not get any happiness
to get you both separated.
You have separated us already,
and now we are getting apart,
look,
Umar will be press in between us,
he cannot give me pain neither you ,
all the pains he is taking alone,
we have two ways only for this,
either you leave him,
or I leave him,
there is no force,
I have to think about it because I love him.
I have said this to Umar repeatedly,
that don’t get worried because of me,
I have no pain,
I am happy in my life
and I have accepted this reality that
you and Umar.
This is the whole problem
that you are happy,
you are happy by living in this house,
you are happy that you are his wife,
you are happy that
you name is in front of his name,
what is the meaning of all this,
that means you consider him your husband
and I cannot takes anyone husband from her,
I don’t want that
Umar loves you in front of your eyes,
you should have say no being her wife,
so it must be understandable,
anyways,
Umar cannot forget me
and he cannot loves you ,
and you don’t want love,
you just need a husband
and I am giving that to you ,
you will not say anything?
What will I say?
I have said everything,
but you are not agreeing to it,
Roshni,
if you would be at my place,
so what would you have done?
Thank God, I am not at your place,
I have the love of Umar
and I am proud,
that I am giving your my love,
I am not snatching it from anyone,
if I would be at your place Maheen,
I would have killed myself,
that I have a person for
the whole life who cannot be mine,
I cannot live the life which has
been given to me as a benefit,
take care of yourself.
Why not anyone tell me what happened?
everyone is sitting with down face,
here you are here sitting with down face,
there Najia is breaking the glass,
or shutting the doors to tell me
that she is on fire right now,
the friend of Maheen has gone,
so she is there sitting in the room with door close,
here a Fareed has come home and he is also worried
and he went inside the room,
tell me what is going on?
Just stay silent; please For God sake,
God forbid if anything happens.
And this Umar and Mansoor,
where are they?
Why have not they come yet?
No one is telling me anything.
He is not yours,
he loves me,
you know all this still you are living with him?
you are being his wife?
Umar will be press in between us,
he cannot give me pain neither you,
all the pains he is taking alone,
we have two ways only for this,
either you leave him,
or I leave him,
there is no force,
I have to think about it because I love him,
Thank God, I am not at your place,
I have the love of Umar
and I am proud,
that I am giving your my love,
I am not snatching it from anyone,
if I would be at your place Maheen,
I would have killed myself,
that I have a person for
the whole life who cannot be mine,
You have played a big game Roshni,
if that will not happen what you are thinking,
if you will come to know that
Umar and Maheen thanks to God
and went on honey moon,
no,
it cannot happen,
I know Maheen since childhood,
I know , which vein has to be pressed at what time,
she will do the same thing ,
what I have thought.
Umar,
Roshni came,
she was saying.
Whatever she was saying,
I don’t want to know,
you don’t need to repeat that,
I will be in pain,
and what she have done was
because of you and me,
just be happy now.
I will be happy to give you pain,
I will be happy?
Just leave any corner of the house so that
a person can get worried while being alone.
You just think that I am not here,
you can get worried,
I will not interfere in anything.
You can go down and get worried.
There is father downstairs,
I am hiding myself from him,
why don’t you go in your room and get worried?
There we have Najia,
and I am hiding myself from him,
I have done a strange act with her in the morning,
now I don’t have courage to face her.
I am also hiding from father,
he have many questions for me.
Umar,
how our parents have up brought us,
if we hurt someone,
we hide our face from them,
I don’t know who are those people
who hurt someone and they are in peace.
You are saying right,
I don’t know, how people can be
happy while giving pain to others.
Did you hurt anyone?
I do not know,
maybe.
