Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
So you know this is Roshni’s action
Obviously I know, man.
I am so stupid, so idiotic,
how did I believe that you said all this.
My Maheen cannot do this?
You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
I know this.
And most importantly,
you can never stain our friendship,
not today, nor tomorrow.
Friendship?
Yes, friendship.
So, you know why Roshni said all this?
Yes,
I know it really well.
I know you and her well.
You are my friend,
and she is my love.
You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
She is really stupid.
You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
Poor thing,
she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
She did all this for your ease,
when she realized that
you won’t be able to say anything in any way,
so she said it,
for your ease.
Think about it.
For my ease?
Yes,
now she is not even answering her phone.
I have been trying her phone for so long.
Since she found out
that you have come back,
since then.
She wants to get out from between us,
so that we stay happy.
She is so stupid.
She loves me after all,
she is trying to live up to it.
This is a weird situation.
What happened?
You didn’t get it?
Maheen?
Aunt is waiting for me.
Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
So you know this is Roshni’s action?
Obviously I know, man.
I am so stupid, so idiotic,
how did I believe that you said all this.
My Maheen cannot do this?
You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
I know this.
And most importantly,
you can never stain our friendship,
not today, nor tomorrow.
I know you and her well.
You are my friend,
and she is my love.
You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
She is really stupid.
You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
Poor thing,
she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
She did all this for your ease,
when she realized that
you won’t be able
to say anything in any way,
so she said it,
for your ease.
Think about it.
Maheen, grandma asked for this, give it to her.
Okay.
Listen.
Yeah?
You have forgiven me, right?
What for?
For letting me go for that blame?
Or understanding Roshni correctly?
Umar,
where did this forgiveness come in between us?
We are friends,
were friends, and will stay friends.
As far as Roshni is concerned,
don’t worry, she will answer your phone.
I will talk to her,
that we are just friends,
childhood friends.
Save your scarf, Maheen.
Roshni, please talk to me,
how long will you run away from me like this?
Will you going away like this,
bring distances between us?
Distances have come in between us Umar,
but its not just distances that are between us,
but Maheen is also there.
And Maheen must have told you everything.
I know but I can understand you
have no fault in all this.
You didn’t do anything with wrong intentions.
Colors have been filled in the flowers,
the season of spring is here.
Come on so that the business runs.
Colors have been filled in the flowers.
Live long son.
Aunt,
all the work for the afternoon is done.
And once the food is cooked,
can I go to mama’s home?
If there is no other work.
What other work will be there?
But Mansoor and Umar have gone,
child, who will you go with?
Anyway,
when coming back,
call Umar, he will pick you,
don’t come alone, ok?
No, I will ask brother Monis,
he will drop me.
Why? Do you have a problem with coming
and going with Umar?
No it will be 7:30, by the time he comes,
I don’t want to leave you
people alone for so long.
I will just stay for an hour
or so and come back.
I will give grandma her medication and go.
Go safely child.
She feels we don’t realize
that she is ignoring Umar.
Razia, you thought like Umar’s mother, right?
Its possible that
she asked Umar to drop her and he said no.
Put it down.
I have my own glass in my hand.
One minute.
Give it to me.
A friend should be like you,
who got the news that
I came and she came to meet me.
Did you get satisfied,
is the burden on your heart lowered?
Did you tell Umar everything?
Now you must be waiting
when Umar will come to me,
when he will talk to me,
when he separates from me.
and he brings his broken heart to you,
so that you console him.
But this wait is useless,
because the colors of my love are
so deep on Umar’s heart
that he still doesn’t have a complaint from me.
your game has turned around.
The attempt would have gone to waste,
if I would have made an attempt.
But I didn’t tell anything to Umar,
you are being happy for no reason.
You told him nothing?
You were saying that
you would tell him the reality.
Yes,
but if I would have told him right now,
what you just said would have happened.
He would have come to me
with his broken heart,
for me to console him.
But I am not a bandage,
nor am I a replacement,
nor do I ever want to become that.
Hello papa.
Hello.
Wow, you look really active today, great!
I got tired of lying on the bed,
so I thought I would come outside.
Okay, I will go meet mama.
Najia,
sit,
I had to talk about something important to you.
Yes?
Child, I had talked to
Mansoor to question Umar,
what he wants.
I had asked you to check Maheen’s heart,
so what happened?
Did he talk.
No.
actually papa its just me and
Mansoor who know the real thing,
then what is the point in
questioning and searching?
Real thing?
What is that?
Mansoor told me not to
talk to anyone about this,
but now the situation
is such maybe I should say it.
I would never say it, had the situation
between them would have been fine.
No,
you tell me,
tell me everything.
What issues do they have?
They don’t have issues,
they have a living, breathing personality.
Umar likes someone.
Now, back in the day,
he married Maheen under the pressure of the situation
but he couldn’t end his contact.
Even after marriage?
Yes.
And Maheen knows this.
Obviously papa,
how much can a girl tolerate.
She cannot stop Umar
from staying away from her,
so maybe that is why
she wants to go her separate way.
But there is something else too papa,
I don’t know if we should consider
Umar this wrong or not.
Yes, what he did after the marriage,
that is wrong,
that is cheating in Maheen’s entrustment.
But if you see if from Umar’s perspective,
even he has been mistreated.
We are all involved in this mistreatment.
And what will you call
what happened with Maheen?
Injustice?
Mistreatment?
Or torment?
Mama,
where is Maheen?
She is in her room, Roshni is also here.
Okay, I got sweets for her,
I will give it to her myself.
So you accepted your defeat?
You realized that Umar can never be yours,
he is mine and he will stay mine.
As far as I know Umar, Roshni
and I know Umar since childhood.
When he finds out about you,
he will never live with you.
But,
I don’t want to pull him by telling him myself,
when he finds out your reality himself,
and he will find out, then he will return.
Then his return will actually be return.
Umar now is my stubbornness,
Maheen and I don’t lack options,
I can get the best of the best,
but only when I want.
When I leave Umar.
When I reject him.
I will not let anyone take him away from me
or if he wants to go away himself,
because this is now a matter of my ego.
Umar likes someone.
Now, back in the day,
he married Maheen under
the pressure of the situation
but he couldn’t end his contact.
Even after marriage?
Yes.
And Maheen knows this.
Obviously papa,
how much can a girl tolerate.
She cannot stop Umar from staying away from her,
so maybe that is why she wants
to go her separate way.
I was worried for no reason till yesterday,
thinking what would happen.
But trust me, I just found out there
is betterment in everything He does.
Someone should have asked me too.
Okay, we will ask you now,
what will you wear at your wedding?
You must have got your dirty jeans.
Hey, you are always joking.
Lower your voice. Lower your voice.
Zakia and Monis were already thinking that
they might mistreat you in the matter of Maheen,
if they hear you they won’t like it.
Papa, no one cares about
what I might and not like.
Someone ask me,
I might have a plan,
I might have something else in my head.
Yes, this is a problem,
it’s a worry,
but because of this one worry a lot of other
worries have been brought into my life.
But you should be happy papa,
on the judgement day you will have your
head held high in front of uncle.
The whole family is praising you,
that your son is so obedient,
he said yes to the wedding
when you asked him once.
She doesn’t want your happiness,
comfort or peace.
You forget her.
What do you mean forget her?
Look Umar,
whatever the issue is between you two,
we will have you two seated in
front of us and listen to you two.
What will you hear?
Now what do you want to hear?
I heard what I had to.
The truth is, she doesn’t like me,
she doesn’t want to live with me.
that is it!
I don’t know if we should consider
Umar this wrong or not.
Yes, what he did after the marriage,
that is wrong,
that is cheating in Maheen’s entrustment.
But if you see if from Umar’s perspective,
even he has been mistreated.
We are all involved in this mistreatment.
And what will you call
what happened with Maheen?
Injustice?
Mistreatment?
Or torment?
Brother Monis,
listen, if you are not busy,
then can you drop me home?
You will not go anywhere now.
No, its really late.
In fact, do one thing,
call Umar and ask him to come here immediately.
No brother,
you know since the accident happened,
Umar has a lot of burden
and he doesn’t get free before 8:00 pm
and I cannot stay here till then,
aunt and uncle really need me.
Those two are not your responsibility.
Yes, if you are no one’s responsibility,
then how can someone
else’s responsibility be yours?
Will you call him or should I call him myself.
What happened?
I have to talk to him.
About what?
Exactly what I heard Roshni say right now.
In fact, now we will talk face to face,
I will just go to uncle and hold Umar’s collar.
No brother Monis,
listen to me. listen to me.
listen to me, please.
Please.
You don’t do anything right now,
you are not going anywhere.
Hear me out peacefully,
don’t do anything in your haste.
Haste?
Its already really late, Maheen,
if I had not heard all this coincidentally
then God knows how long you would
have hid Umar’s weaknesses from us.
I was not hiding it from you people,
I was hiding it for our families,
you have any idea if this becomes public,
all hell will break loose.
Don’t talk like a child,
you mean all torments
and pains are for my sister?
Lower your voice, for God’s sake,
mama will hear you.
Yes, mama will hear it, obviously,
when this will come out in the open,
mama will hear it.
In fact, this should be cleared today,
I will take you and mama along and
stand in front of uncle and hold Umar’s collar.
Fine. Fine. Fine.
Hold his collar, I will come with you.
But right now,
for God’s sake hear me patiently,
just listen to me.
Then we will go,
we will go together.
Come.
Careful.
Careful.
Who is that damned girl?
Who is it is not the issue,
the issue is that she is in Umar’s life.
Hey, how can she take over Umar’s life like that?
The one who is married is part of your life,
she is a stranger.
Umar’s life,
Umar’s future, everything is Maheen.
The wedding is between two people,
between two hearts and its not necessary.
A wedding is an acceptance, a rule,
the young generation doesn’t believe in any rules.
And the one who has already
confessed his love to someone,
will he give importance to the rules made later or
the promises made earlier.
Fareed, you are taking Umar’s side?
You are giving justifications for his actions?
I didn’t expect this from you.
I am not taking his side.
I am not taking his side,
but I am not able to ignore it.
It’s a weird difficulty, weird test.
I don’t understand whose side to take,
Umar’s or
Maheen?
Obviously,
Maheen is the girl we got married in this home,
our responsibility, our blood, our respect
and most importantly Umar’s wife.
Maheen has the most right on Umar.
Instead of supporting Umar,
we have to stop his feet
and make his home, Fareed.
We need to make his home.
And heart?
Will that be made too?
Come.
Sit down.
Okay, tell me now,
what do you want to do?
why do you want to hold his collar?
I am your brother,
I will take revenge for
the mistreatment you received.
Why did he do all this with you?
He did it?
Think about it.
Brother, did he come to you with a proposal?
Or did he tell you and mama
that he will keep me happy.
But this wedding was with his will,
he should have said no.
Yes,
this is his mistake,
I accept and even he will accept.
Then?
Whatever he is doing with Roshni,
everyone should be told about this,
he should get a little ashamed.
Fine,
we will embarrass him,
then?
Then what?
Then what brother?
If you embarrass him in front of everyone,
will he start liking me instead of Roshni
and if uncle and aunt are strict with him,
then he will gain respect for me in his heart?
So I be quiet like you?
I don’t take revenge for the mistreatment you go.
No, do it.
But tell me, what will this achieve?
You know something,
if I want,
I can force Umar to hate Roshni.
But I don’t want to do that.
But why Maheen? Why?
Because this will not achieve anything brother.
Hating Roshni doesn’t mean that…
that he will start loving me.
Even if I take out Roshni from his heart,
there will be an empty space in his heart,
and its not necessary that I will get that place.
You don’t go Maheen,
this home is for you,
don’t go to the man
who doesn’t know your worth.
I will have to go brother,
for aunt,
for grandma,
for my uncle.
I will go there and live as their child.
Brother, I have left everything up to God.
Listen to me,
let what is happening, happen.
Someone has to return,
now the time will tell if it will be me, or Umar.
So leave it.
My lovely brother.
I cannot tolerate it any further.
No,
leave it God.
Come on sit.
We won’t go to mama like this.
Thank God you came.
Why do you call me again and again?
Can you live without me?
You can,
so live.
Not at all.
Roshni, life without you is no life.
You know well,
I cannot live without you.
I love you.
Maheen is back,
so what is the problem now?
She didn’t come for me,
she doesn’t love me at all, in fact,
maybe she dislikes me.
She really loves my family,
she returned for them.
Forever?
I mean,
Umar for you and Maheen,
I did all that I could,
I had even decided to leave your life,
but you didn’t let me leave.
Then when Maheen left,
without thinking or understanding anything,
I said so much about your family,
because I knew Maheen wouldn’t
be able to do all this herself.
Now she is back…
I don’t know.
But still,
I will do what you tell me to.
Roshni,
just a little more wait.
I will talk to papa this time.
Will your father agree?
I will think about this later
whether he agrees or not,
right now I just have to talk him right now.
Umar, I am scared,
you will fall weak in your parents
and Maheen’s pressure.
I know, this will happen.
