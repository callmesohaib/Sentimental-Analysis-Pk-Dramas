Come.
Sit down.
Okay, tell me now,
what do you want to do?
why do you want to hold his collar?
I am your brother,
I will take revenge for
the mistreatment you received.
Why did he do all this with you?
He did it?
Think about it.
Brother, did he come to you with a proposal?
Or did he tell you and mama
that he will keep me happy.
But this wedding was with his will,
he should have said no.
Yes,
this is his mistake,
I accept and even he will accept.
Then?
Whatever he is doing with Roshni,
everyone should be told about this,
he should have a little ashamed.
Fine,
we will embarrass him,
then?
Then what?
Then what brother?
If you embarrass him in front of everyone,
will he start liking me instead of Roshni
and if uncle and aunt are strict with him,
then he will gain respect for me in his heart?
So I be quiet like you?
I don’t take revenge for the mistreatment you go.
No, do it.
But tell me, what will this achieve?
You know something,
if I want,
I can force Umar to hate Roshni.
But I don’t want to do that.
But why Maheen? Why?
Because this will not achieve anything brother.
Hating Roshni doesn’t mean that…
that he will start loving me.
Even if I take out Roshni from his heart,
there will be an empty space in his heart,
and its not necessary that I will get that place.
You don’t go Maheen,
this home is for you,
don’t go to the man
who doesn’t know your worth.
I will have to go brother,
for aunt,
for grandma,
for my uncle.
I will go there and live as their child.
Brother, I have left everything up to God.
Listen to me,
let what is happening, happen.
Someone has to return,
now the time will tell if it will be me, or Umar.
So leave it.
My lovely brother.
I cannot tolerate it any further.
No,
leave it God.
Come on sit.
We won’t go to mama like this.
Thank God you came.
Why do you call me again and again?
Can you live without me?
You can,
so live.
Not at all.
Roshni, life without you is no life.
You know well,
I cannot live without you.
I love you.
Maheen is back,
so what is the problem now?
She didn’t come for me,
she doesn’t love me at all, in fact,
maybe she dislikes me.
She really loves my family,
she returned for them.
Forever?
I mean,
Umar for you and Maheen,
I did all that I could,
I had even decided to leave your life,
but you didn’t let me leave.
Then when Maheen left,
without thinking or understanding anything,
I said so much about your family,
because I knew Maheen wouldn’t
be able to do all this herself.
Now she is back…
I don’t know.
But still,
I will do what you tell me to.
Roshni,
just a little more wait.
I will talk to papa this time.
Will your father agree?
I will think about this later
whether he agrees or not,
right now I just have to talk him right now.
Umar, I am scared,
you will fall weak in your parents
and Maheen’s pressure.
I know, this will happen.
Hello uncle.
Hello, is Zakia fine?
Yes, she is absolutely fine.
Monis went from outside,
without meeting me.
He had to go to do some important work,
he will come next time.
I wanted to talk to you, child.
Yes?
Saying something like this to the daughter
and daughter in law is weird,
but there is no other way
to clear the situation,
so without any delay,
I am asking you,
is there a girl in Umar’s life?
What was the need to say all this?
Papa asked and I told him.
Yes, it was your duty to tell him the whole story.
God knows what will happen
to poor Umar after this.
He is the only poor one,
even after doing everything.
He has an innocent girl at home,
and he is having an affair.
Hey Najia, that is another matter.
Look there can be another reason
for Maheen leaving the home too,
or else she would have told everyone clearly
that there is someone else in Umar’s life.
But did you forget what she said?
What excuses she made for not coming here.
We don’t know the real thing,
its possible that
Umar doesn’t even meet that girl,
there can be another reason for their distances.
Yes fine,
papa will find out the real thing himself.
You don’t worry.
See,
you have fallen weak already,
here I just mentioned Maheen,
all your courage,
all your strength,
gave up.
Its not that,
but I have to think for her too.
For her too?
I mean, I have to think about her too.
She doesn’t care that I like you,
I love you,
nor is she upset on this,
she has never expressed it.
But when this things comes in
the open in front of everyone,
then I will have to face a thousand questions.
I have to answer to everyone, so if I don’t think,
then what will I do?
she went to her mother’s home for a few days
and I have to hear so much from aunt
and then mama,
I have to think about her too.
Its possible mama and
papa will respect my wish,
listen to me,
but they will not let anything
wrong happen with Maheen,
so I have to think about all this.
I swear,
trust me Roshni,
this time I will talk to mama
and papa to go to your home
and ask for your proposal
and they will have to go.
Just a little more wait.
Speak up, Maheen.
I know the truth,
I just want you to verify.
Did Umar tell you?
Oh, so it is the truth.
Right?
Umar doesn’t have the moral courage to tell me,
I am surprised how he told you.
With what heart did he break
this mountain on your head.
I know it from the start,
before the wedding.
Look child,
I am equally embarrassed to Umar 
as I am with you.
If you have been mistreated then
Umar’s fault is less, my fault is more.
Don’t say that.
Child, trust me,
I didn’t have such an intention.
If I had known about Umar,
I wouldn’t have let this moment come,
neither would you have gone through this test,
you have been through so much.
Nothing like that,
I am really happy.
How can someone stay happy in such a situation.
Not you, not Umar, nor anyone of us.
We now just have to decide that
one of you gets your happiness.
But who?
I don’t understand.
It’s a big test Maheen.
It’s a big test Maheen.
I will go check on aunt.
Sister in law, why did you do this?
Because you wouldn’t have done it.
You should have spoken to me once.
I have tried so many times, Maheen,
that you talk to me,
share your sorrows with me,
but no, you like hiding things.
Now what did that do?
now papa will tighten his screws,
he has no shame,
he has such a good wife and
he is having an affair outside.
If he would have had an affair
with me as his wife, then it was wrong,
but sister in law its my fault.
Even after knowing he is with someone else,
I came into his life shamelessly.
Stop this self pity?
What would you have done?
Said no on the time of the wedding?
He couldn’t say no on the time of
the wedding being a man,
you would have said no being a woman.
Stop it.
Stop giving these justification and
give me the address of that girl,
then you will see what I do.
What?
What will you say to her?
I will insult her.
Why sister in law?
She never took away Umar from me,
Umar was never mine.
Maheen,
me and Mansoor loved each other,
we were lucky that
we got married to each other.
If Mansoor’s parents had
married him to someone else,
I wouldn’t have turned back and looked.
That girl is the most responsible,
who knows Umar is married,
still she instigates him.
Sister in law,
you did what you had to.
Now what uncle says to Umar
and what he replies to him,
that is important.
Not that girl.
Maheen.
Papa,
did Maheen tell you…
No,
she didn’t tell me anything,
but I verified from him.
What did you think?
Your actions would remain hidden?
You will have an affair
and we will stay quiet?
Does this happen in decent people?
Umar, you should have told me earlier.
I tried papa,
I thought I would say no,
but the situation was not such then.
Tell me one thing,
had I said no then,
would you have stepped
back from your decision?
I may have done it,
had I thought about it deeply.
I would have found another way
to keep my brother’s respect
and I might not have been able to do it.
I might have thought that
its important to keep respect at this time.
So papa, I was helpless, right?
Okay,
fine, you were helpless.
What had to happen, happened.
Even I was not happy with this relation,
I was upset,
but once she came to the house as a daughter in law
I accepted her with an open heart.
Now you too forget everything
and live a proper life.
I was trying, but…
What did you try?
You kept on meeting her,
and see your courage,
you told your wife too.
You have no shame or not?
Maheen understands me more
than you people,
she has no objection,
she has no complaints from me,
why are you people blaming me?
She has no complaints from you?
She has no sorrow? No objection?
No papa, you can ask her.
Then why did she went to her home?
Why did she got upset and
went to her mother’s home?
You shouldn’t have listened to him
and slapped him.
What are you saying Razia?
He is not a child,
and its not a matter of getting
less marks in exams,
this is the test of life.
Umar,
listen…
Umar.
Umar.
Yes, go ahead Maheen.
Did uncle…
listen I didn’t tell him anything.
If you didn’t tell him,
then I will have to find the person who did,
because I need to thank them.
Thank them?
Yes,
I had to tell them one day or another.
I had so much burden on me,
he took away half my burden,
made it easy for me.
Then you should be happy,
I was worried for no reason.
I will be happy when the rest of
my work will be easy.
Listen.
What now?
I will make the rest of your work easy.
Do thank me then.
Roshni,
stop these actions of yours,
I will not tolerate these lectures.
If you don’t fix yourself,
I know how to fix you,
and that too really well.
Why?
Am I under imprisonment?
Can I not get out anywhere?
Is there a restriction?
Yes, there is a restriction,
because single girls from decent homes
don’t come home so late at night
and that too in the cars of others.
No, I was coming in a rickshaw.
Shut this nonsense.
Khurshida saw everything from her roof
that you came in someone’s car and
that too at the corner of the locality.
Mama, that was my friend and her brother,
and you are doubting me,
that too listening to these
instigating women of the locality.
Okay, so you came with your friend?
If you came with a friend,
why did you get off
at the corner of the locality,
why didn’t you get dropped in front of the home?
Why did you lie to me
that you came in a rickshaw?
To save myself from all this.
Because my friend’s brother
was driving the car.
Now if had parked the car outside the home,
your doubts would have started from there only.
I will still have doubts.
Tell me, who is that girl,
I will also meet your friend?
Mama, you are doubting me.
I am not doubting you, I am sure madam.
I feel you will ruin my respect for sure.
You are after some goon.
Mama, he is no goon,
he is a good and decent man.
These decent men don’t go around taking
daughters of other’s home out.
Shameless girl.
He will marry me and
he will bring a proposal really soon.
I will see when he brings the proposal.
That was a close call.
Why doesn’t he reply.
I am so helpless,
I can worry for my sister,
I can get sad for her,
but I cannot do anything.
Maheen is right,
no matter what I do,
I cannot bring love in Umar’s heart for her.
Dear God,
give me enough courage that
I can defeat my heart,
give me the strength that
I can do what I am going to do.
The breakfast is ready.
Bring it here.
Why?
Mama and papa will be downstairs,
I will have to face them,
and then grandma would be there too.
No, you won’t have to face anyone,
you rest assured.
Not even uncle.
Before they make any decision,
they would want to discuss it with me,
they would want to know if I agree or not,
so no one will say anything to you right now.
Decision?
The same,
that you are waiting for.
Just remember,
you have to thank me.
Tell me something, Maheen.
Why would you do all this?
And who would you do it for?
You said it yourself that I am your friend.
The truest friend,
now you put so much burden
of our friendship on me,
I have to remove it.
You are not at peace,
instead of staying on your bed comfortably,
you go around so much.
You are not well Fareed.
No, its your superstition mama.
Hello.
Hello. Live long.
I am just going, bye.
Okay, bye.
Go safe, come back safe.
See Fareed,
our Umar has become so smart,
and responsible.
In his age, even you were
not this smart and responsible,
he cares for everyone so much,
he cares for everyone.
He worries.
Umar.
Yes papa.
Come back in the evening,
don’t get too late.
I have to talk about something important.
Yes.
Fine.
What do you want to talk about, Fareed?
Is everything ok?
Yes, everything is fine.
No, there is something,
I have been seeing since yesterday,
day before, everyone is upset.
Everyone is quiet,
there is something that
all of you are hiding it from me.
You are mistaken mama,
another superstition.
Yes,
I have grown old,
I am old,
I have no importance in this home,
no one tells me anything.
Everyone hides things from me.
What do you say?
Should we talk to Umar straightforwardly?
First let me decide
what I have to talk about.
What is there to think about in this?
Tell him clearly to take out
that girl from his heart
and live in this home like a decent man.
If there is a need, scold him.
If I had found out about
this some time back, Razia.
I would have been strict with Umar,
I would have forced him,
but now this will not happen.
Why?
Why can’t it happen now?
I have seen death from up-close Razia.
So much life has passed,
yours and my wedding,
kids, their wedding.
We saw success and defeat,
we saw it all.
We didn’t lose the will to live.
You know when I saw death in front of me,
all the hidden happiness in
my heart came in front of my eyes,
that I won’t be able to see
them being complete.
God forbid,
what are you saying?'
I have lived my life,
in fact, figured it out.
When someone like me feels this way,
then my Umar is a child,
won’t he have wishes in his heart?
Do I make him regret?
Hey,
how have you started thinking?
For God’s sake Mr. Fareed, be smart.
Will you get cursed by the family
to fulfil your son’s wish?
Will you make a new example by bringing
a second wife on top of your niece.
That’s it.
That’s it.
That is where I stop thinking about Maheen.
You and I can’t get her,
her happiness and right even if we want to.
Even if we listen to Umar and even
if we don’t listen to Umar, then too.
Then too?
Look,
if we scold and force
Umar to live with Maheen,
how will Maheen stay happy with someone about
whom she knows that he likes someone else.
Tell me.
With time everything gets fine.
