Why are you crying now?
No.
You may hide your tears,
but your empty eyes tell everything.
Why don’t you say that you love him?
How long will you hide it?
And from him…
if you have to hide it from him,
then at least accept it yourself.
What acceptance sister in law?
I am embarrassed,
because I am trying to show
ownership on someone else’s thing.
Someone else’s?
He is your husband
and you should have made him realize this.
You don’t make someone realize,
one realizes on their own.
I realized it.
And you don’t even ask for love,
you get it.
I didn’t get it,
Roshni did.
No,
at times you need to ask for love,
just like a prayer.
If prayers are made
with intensity and power,
they get accepted.
Look at me,
the doctors said no to me
after seeing all my test results,
they told me it won’t happen.
But see what happened?
God’s blessing won,
you too ask for it once.
You asked for something
for something that was already yours,
how can I ask for someone else’s thing?
So will you live all your life with this burden?
No,
Umar’s love is not a burden on my heart,
I am at peace,
that to get him,
I didn’t had to take support of anything.
Neither truth, nor lies.
A person can pray to God,
but cannot ask for love from a man.
This is not something you ask for in charity.
Umar.
Yes?
I want to talk to you
about something important.
Go ahead.
Speak up Maheen.
Its Roshni.
I have to tell you that
I am shifting downstairs in grandma’s room,
this room will be for you and Roshni…
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.
What do you want?
I asked you, what do you want?
How many medals do you
want on your shoulders?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What is your problem?
What do I do?
I am asking you, what do I do?
How much burden will you put on me
because of your favors?
Speak up.
Speak up.
I don’t have a daughter,
still my heart is hurting.
You always considered her your daughter,
then how can you…
Uncle,
I wanted your permission.
Yes, go ahead child.
Tell me.
Can I go to mama’s home for a day or two.
But day after tomorrow…
Yes child, surely.
Go for a week.
You will be able to rest
and after all,
we are much better now.
Don’t worry about this place.
Yes…
Thank you.
After I return,
I will shift to grandma’s room.
Live… live long.
I wanted myself that
she shouldn’t stay here on this occasion.
But I didn’t have the courage to say it.
Its good,
she decided to go herself.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
How many more medals do you
want on your shoulders?
What do I do?
what do I do?
what is your problem?
What do I do?
I am asking you what should I do?
How much further will you put me 
under the burden of your favors?
Why don’t you say that you love him?
how long will you hide it?
And from him,
but even if you hide it from him,
accept it yourself.
Here you go.
Okay sister in law,
will meet in a few days.
Listen,
these few days will become a pain for you,
you cannot tolerate it, right?
Yes,
I cannot tolerate it.
I cannot tolerate that 
Umar is in constant guilt because of me.
he cannot even be happy with me here.
When he looks at me,
he just looks embarrassed.
He feels that
he cannot do justice with me.
at least, at this point in his life
when I am not here,
he will be able to celebrate
the happiness of having his love.
He will have that feeling.
But Maheen, you…
Maheen,
come on.
I have come to get you.
Okay sister in law.
Maheen, take care of yourself.
What is your problem?
You are not replying to my messages,
you are not even calling me back.
Have you forgotten
that I am your future wife?
Huh?
What is wrong with you?
Everyone is listening.
Come to the side.
Leave my hand.
What is your problem?
You need to have manners.
Tell me,
what do I reply to your messages with?
I have nothing to say.
How much more time do you want?
Huh?
How much have
I gone through for you Umar?
I have heard the world ridicule me,
my mother’s pressure,
seeing you becoming someone else’s,
Maheen’s hatred.
I want peace in my future life.
I want peace.
Roshni, I am trying to keep you happy 
as much as its possible for me.
Only for your peace,
I ruin everyone else’s peace?
Everyone else’s peace?
My life,
my compromises,
me ruining my life,
will I not get anything in return for it?
What favors of everyone do I repay?
Listen, listen to me calmly,
the wedding is day after tomorrow,
you have tomorrow,
you get the upstairs portion emptied,
I will live with you,
I wont live with your mother,
father and grandmother.
I have not taken their responsibility.
The condition for whom they have
put to live in the home,
she should care for them.
No Roshni,
that is not possible.
Umar, listen to me,
they depend on you right now,
you can make them to agree to anything.
Listen to me carefully,
if you don’t take a step,
then I will have to take
a step out of helplessness.
For example. For example, what?
For example at the time of the wedding,
I will say no to the wedding.
This will be your last favor on me.
Yes, Roshni,
I will not be able to do this.
If you do this,
then our difficulty will become easy.
Umar…
Maheen.
Its good you came.
Take these things to grandma’s room.
What is all this?
Things, keep them in grandma’s room.
Why are Maheen things going
 to grandma’s room?
Umar,
both girls can live in your life,
but they cannot live in the same room, right?
Pick it up.
Leave it.
You move.
Sister in law, come here. Come here.
What are you doing?
Maheen’s things will not go anywhere. 
Maheen.
Maheen.
Maheen.
She is at her mother’s home.
Why is she at her mother’s home?
Before she went, 
she asked me to shift her things there.
Why did you people let her go?
What is wrong with you?
You are worrying like she will not come back.
After all, her stay here in the days of your 
and Roshni’s wedding is not right.
She will feel less pain
and she also says that 
when she is not here,
you will have lesser guilt.
Pick it up.
Leave it.
What I couldn’t say to him, 
I can say to myself.
I can accept it myself,
even after not wanting to,
I have started to love him.
I don’t know when, how.
I didn’t realize when Umar became 
the most important for me.
I know he doesn’t love me, but Roshni.
But I cannot stop him from wishing,
I cannot stop him from loving.
I will accept another thing today,
that a lot of times have come 
when my heart became selfish
and thought that I tell him some realities 
knowing which he would only be mine.
But I couldn’t be this selfish.
Not because my conscience didn’t let me,
but only because you 
need love in return of love.
When his love is not in my fate,
what will I do with him being with me?
There was a time,
when I felt that telling you about Roshni,
I would break your heart,
now I myself know that you find out
that she has changed her way a long time back,
because the sorrow of breaking a heart
 is much more than having your heart broken,
that too for someone 
who has been made of love like you.
Today, you should know 
that both of us were helpless,
but Roshni,
Roshni had changed her way by her will,
by liking someone else.
How are you Monis?
What did you come here for, Umar?
I came to get Maheen.
I will not send her there now.
Its not about you sending her,
nor is it about me taking her.
The thing is if Maheen wants to come along or not,
she has to decide.
No,
she is making this decision under pressure 
and out of helplessness.
And the allegation Roshni has put on her,
out of the fear of it being proven true,
she will sit in a corner of your home, 
useless, and ruin her whole life.
So I will not let her make this decision.
One minute,
what allegation did Roshni put on her?
Like you know nothing.
No, Monis.
Roshni has put the allegation that
 Maheen likes someone else,
and she is doing all this so that her path…
damn such a liar!
Thank you Roshni.
What nonsense is this?
Trust me Monis, one by one all 
the burdens have been removed,
everything is clear.
Roshni is right,
she really loves someone,
she loves me,
she loves me a lot.
Don’t worry Monis,
everything will be alright.
Yes mama, I am coming to get you.
Yes.
Roshni,
Roshni, what are you doing?
Listen to me.
You have a misunderstanding, 
why would I do this?
If you don’t want to take away Umar from me,
 then who will do it?
If I had to take Umar away from you, 
I would have done it a million times earlier,
I had a lot of chances,
I would have told her the truth, 
that you got tired of him a long time back,
you told me to tell him to leave you alone.
I could have told him the truth that
you were dreaming of marrying 
someone at the time of our wedding.
In fact, I could even tell him 
when your mother told me herself
that you were dying to 
marry your cousin, Roshni.
You went to Lahore yourself,
 and came back only when you were disappointed.
But I didn’t tell anything, Roshni. Nothing.
Only because, no one could say in my life 
that I tried to take him away from you
or by telling the truth, or by lying, 
or by any way possible.
You did good that 
you didn’t tell him anything,
that he was so mad in my love, 
he was so stupid,
that even if you would have spoken the truth,
 he would have considered it a lie.
What do you think?
Umar is really innocent,
Umar messaged and 
called me after marriage,
he promised to marry me, 
and married you.
And Maheen you, 
you didn’t live up to our friendship.
You married the man I loved, 
you people cheated me too.
If I thought for myself, 
what wrong did I do?
Umar, are you mad?
Not mad.
I am free.
I had decided before coming here,
but there was a sadness in my heart,
I might have had some guilt that 
maybe I am cheating someone.
But,
I…
I feel a burden has been lifted off me,
a huge burden.
You go from here.
You too are free, go.
Did you not hear me?
I told you to leave from here!
Umar.
Umar, what has happened to you? 
What has happened?
Move back.
I have to sit and talk to my wife, alone.
I don’t want a third
 person to come between us.
Third person?
We were together,
 she is the third person!
Maheen, come home.
The whole family knows 
I have come to get you.
Come on.
Leave her hand.
You cannot do this with me, and she?
She is the reason behind all this, 
I will not leave him.
leave me. leave me.
Roshni, you have gone mad. Umar.
She is my wife.
Do you hear that?
Get out!
I knew it.
I knew you would cheat me again,
you promised to marry me,
 and you married her.
I got fooled by you again,
but Umar I will not let you 
cheat me this time.
I will not leave her.
Yes, I am cheating.
I am cheating!
But I am not cheating you,
 I am cheating myself.
Because I loved Maheen, not you!
Your reality just came in front of me,
you had bad intentions from day one.
But I was a fool,
who used to think something else.
Get lost from here.
Get out!
Get out, Roshni.
Get out.
Get out.
Umar.
Get out. Get out.
Sorry.
You know,
this is what I wanted.
If you come back to me,
then you should come 
because of your heart,
because of love,
and that you don’t come to me 
disappointed with a broken heart.
You said it yourself,
that there is no this 
and also that in love.
In love it’s either this or that.
