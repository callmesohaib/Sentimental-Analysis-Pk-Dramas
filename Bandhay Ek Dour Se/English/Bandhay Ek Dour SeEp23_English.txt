Oh God Roshni, stop it!
You have been sleeping since evening,
wake up now. it’s enough.
I am getting up.
Your friend is here too,
you have to go meet her too.
What is the hurry? I will meet her.
No,
you will not go anywhere tomorrow.
Your uncle’s grandson,
they have a party for him,
you will go with me.
Mama,
I will not go anywhere tomorrow anyway
and what about Maheen,
she is there at her mother’s home.
What?
What do you mean?
This means that she wasn’t able to get along
with her in-laws and not even her husband.
What are you saying, Roshni?
God have mercy.
God have mercy, mama.
Get me something to eat, please.
Yes, I will get something.
Thank you.
Hello.
How are you Maheen?
I am fine sister in law.
I don’t find anything fine
between you and Umar.
What happened that you packed your bag
and went to your mother’s home?
What can I say sister in law,
at time a person has to make decisions
that your heart doesn’t agree to,
but the mind tells you that it’s okay.
Maheen, you don’t make
such big decisions alone.
You should have talked to me,
we are all your well wishers.
In fact, you are like my younger sister,
what am I here for?
So much happened and
you didn’t tell us anything.
what a lot?
A loot didn’t happen,
its just that everyone made
something so small a big issue.
You left your home,
you left Umar and
you are sitting at your mother’s home,
its not something so small, Maheen.
Tell me,
what is the reason for not liking Umar?
There is no reason sister in law.
The situation in which we got married…
we didn’t have time
to understand each other.
What do you mean?
What more do the two of you
want to understand?
You did something so weird.
At least you could have spoken to me,
I would have given you the solution for this problem.
I would have given you such a solution
that the problem would have solved
and there was no need to break the relations.
Hello?
Maheen, are you listening?
Yes sister in law,
I listen to everyone.
Now tell me,
what is the solution for this problem?
You will find out soon sister in law.
Hello.
Maheen?
I kept on waiting for you on the roof all night,
I thought you would be really worried,
so you will surely come.
I go to the roof to get worried
in peace in my loneliness,
now I am lonely in my room too,
so I enjoy my worries there.
Umar.
Yes.
Umar.
Yes papa, I am ready, lets go.
No,
I will handle the work,
you will go to take Maheen and convince her.
She has told me not to.
You are not so obedient to your wife,
that you agree to everything she says.
Papa…
One minute,
she said and you agreed.
What she said is your duty.
Apart from that you do everything you want,
you do what you like.
I am surprised,
you are laughing brother Mansoor,
and papa, you are talking
about me doing what I want,
if I wanted to do what I wanted…
Umar.
Umar, listen…
Umar.
Papa,
have breakfast.
I am not in the mood.
What are you saying?
Whenever Maheen has come, 
she has always praised her in-laws.
Whenever I asked her how Umar
and her in-laws are with her,
she said that they are really good with her.
If they were good,
she wouldn’t have here,
she tolerated everything as much as she could.
After all Zakia,
girls say such things to their friends,
they don’t bother their mother with it.
No secret is hidden from my Roshni.
Roshni told me that her in-laws torment her,
Umar and his family are really arrogant.
She is an orphan, their own blood,
they should have cared a little.
Okay Zakia, I will go.
I have to go to a function in the evening,
I heard Maheen is here,
so I couldn’t stop myself.
Maheen is just like my Roshni.
Zakia, don’t worry,
I will go .
Hey, are you in your senses Zakia?
Your brother gave Maheen
the pocket money himself
and I forced Umar to take Maheen for shopping
and you are saying 
we were keeping an eye on her expenses.
She has never got a dress made for any child
apart from those on the religious feasts,
and she is talking now!
Be careful what you say, Zakia.
Call Maheen.
Call her.
Tell her to say all this in front me, 
whatever she has told you.
There is a limit to lying.
Hey, she is lying.
Complete lies.
Maheen is not such a  girl that says something wrong, 
she is the one who likes to fight.
Okay, come on now, blame Umar for this too.
Hey, Umar has never even talked
to Maheen in a loud voice.
Hey, you mother and
daughter don’t even fear God.
Wait.
Wait Zakia,
I am coming myself,
I will teach you
I will fix your daughter’s mood.
God damn it, we did everything,
we gave her so much
 and she let it go in vain.
Do you hear that?
God forbid.
God damn it.
Thankless mother and daughter.
Did you see mama, how Maheen is blaming us.
Let Fareed come,
I will tell him everything.
We did everything for her.
Mama, these spices!
Papa has sent me to convince you.
So you came?
To convince me.
No.
You forgot this there.
I forgot a lot of things,
send those things as well.
You are asking for your things?
What is wrong with you Maheen?
Why are you running so fast?
The family is already upset because of you,
you just came yesterday
and now you are asking about
getting your things back.
The whole family will be after me.
Everyone say that I am naïve.
Even you don’t understand Umar.
Did aunt agree to this decision of yours?
No.
Maheen, even my heart is not convinced.
Why?
Maheen, you have took an emotional decision,
but you will be facing the most difficulty.
I only have to answer my family’s questions,
and they will forget in some time too.
You are a girl,
whose questions will you answer?
You will have to face everyone.
You feel that
I will spend the rest of my life in regrets,
right Umar?
That is why your heart doesn’t agree.
Because you feel
that when you will separate yourself from me,
what will I do?
No one else will make me theirs,
I will live alone all my life, helpless.
You have a lot of sympathy for me, right?
Not sympathy,
but…
This is called sympathy,
honestly,
living with you,
I have felt sorry for myself a lot,
instead of being sorry,
I would rather live a life of regrets.
Zakia will tell everyone in the family, 
she will defame me.
Hey, she didn’t think once
before taking out old enmity,
that she is ruining her daughter’s home.
Mama,
I am sure there is some misunderstanding.
What misunderstanding?
I didn’t hear it from a third person,
Zakia herself told me all the torment 
and trouble we have done on Maheen.
may God curse the liars.
I don’t understand
how Maheen can say all this.
I am sure aunt is mistaken.
This is what I don’t believe
that Maheen fought with Umar,
and got upset with us and left
and doesn’t want to come back.
She was happy and smiling till yesterday.
How did all of this happen overnight.
She didn’t do good.
You have this water.
Get the tray.
I don’t understand Maheen,
what has happened to you suddenly?
Why do you suddenly not like me?
Why do you have so many complaints from me?
Whatever happened to me,
I have never held you responsible for it.
I never tried or had intentions of hurting you,
I have always cared for you
and wanted to treat you the same way
like I have since childhood, like always.
I always wanted to keep you and Roshni,
both happy.
Me and Roshni?
Yes Maheen,
I don’t want to see either one of you sad, never!
You are my childhood friend and she is my love.
You are dear to me and so is she.
Umar,
in love its either this or that.
This too and that too doesn’t happen.
Stop Umar, listen to me.
Yes.
You should be ashamed.
You should be ashamed.
I knew about mama,
she never let her daughter in law be at peace,
then how would she let her grand 
daughter in law live in peace?
I knew about Razia’s temperament,
she already hated me,
and that Najia,
she is a two sided sword.
Still I sent Maheen to your home,
only after trusting you.
One minute, what happened?
Okay,
you will still ask me what happened?
My daughter came back to her
mother’s home after being ruined.
Then you ask Maheen why she came back.
She came by her will,
me, mama or no one else has
anyone else’s involvement in it.
Papa sent me to convince her
and bring her back.
Okay, convince her or threaten her?
Aunt, why would I threaten her?
I don’t know,
but brother Fareed is always
 busy in convincing Maheen,
But he does not make you understand,
or stop Razia.
He saw with his own eyes how 
she was being tormented and mistreated.
What?
What are you saying?
What torment?
What mistreatment?
What are you asking her?
You people consider her 
someone that doesn’t talk.
An orphan girl, whose mother is a widow.
Aunt?
Look, listen to me,
the sadness of my daughter
is huge for me, really huge.
You make her do all the work at home,
that’s fine, but raising your hand,
swearing at her and not a
single penny as pocket money.
What?
Mama, for God’s sake, be quiet,
what are you saying?
Why? Why should I be quiet?
He raises his hand on you,
his mother doesn’t give you food,
puts restrictions on you,
keeps you deprived and I be quiet?
Umar?
What nonsense is this mama?
Why did you say this?
When did I make these complaints?
I don’t know what Umar must be thinking about me.
Let him think what he wants.
And what do you think?
If you don’t tell me anything,
I won’t find out anything.
Mama, this is not the truth.
Okay,
then you are mad that you left your husband’s home
and came to your mother’s home.
Maybe.
Maybe, I am mad.
Oh God, these people have
made my daughter mad.
May God question them.
Umar.
What is it? Speak up.
What are you looking at?
Only looking at you won’t make a difference, 
I will have to do something.
What do you mean?
What will you have to do?
Look Umar, all this is not right,
there is time, I am telling you understand.
You are my brother in law later, friend first.
I will beat you up so much.
You are threatening me.
I am in a bad mood already,
don’t talk nonsense with me.
Move back!
Najia, make me tea, please.
Hey, I have kept tea.
Mansoor, listen.
Yeah?
The girl Umar wanted to marry
and then we had a misunderstanding and we felt…
Yes, go ahead, don’t give a speech.
Does Umar still meet her?
Why?
Tell me, does he meet her or not?
I am sure you know something.
Look, I don’t know about him meeting her,
but, he is still in touch, I am sure of that.
Yes,
I have seen Umar talking on the phone secretly.
What is going on in your head now?
Not in my head, Umar’s head.
I am sure Maheen got upset 
because of this and left home.
Who can tolerate a second woman.
Umar says that Maheen knew it all.
that was in the past,
now he is her husband and 
tolerating another woman is a big issue.
Yes, its possible.
and now Umar is trying to cover it up by saying
he doesn’t know why Maheen left home.
Obviously,
how will she tell herself that despite living with him,
 he is having an affair outside.
Man, are you making tea or curry?
You are only concerned about yourself,
I will now tell everyone
what the real reason is, you will see.
Hey, what is wrong?
Najia, for God’s sake,
our relations with mama have improved with
difficulty and don’t ruin it in your haste.
Taking out results based on
speculation is something you do a lot.
I will make tea myself.
Listen to me.
What was the need for mama to say all this?
Mama did right.
If I was in her place,
I wouldn’t have cared about his and my relation.
You are still not caring for the relation, brother.
Look,
I agree that the situation in which you and
Umar got married, these thing happen but now,
Umar’s mistreatment is getting out of hand
and people are seeing it too.
What are they seeing?
What have you seen? Tell me.
The way he got out in his anger,
everyone would have seen it and
the locality makes the whole movie out of it.
Look Maheen, my lovely sister,
understand this,
if you want to live your life with Umar,
then you will have to make yourself strong
so you can respond to people.
And you leaving home and coming here
is not a problem for us,
but being quiet and sitting here,
thinking of that home, it will not sort the problem.
Roshni, I cannot talk right now,
I will talk later.
Why?
Are you still trying to convince her?
What is wrong Roshni?
If you want, I can come, I can convince her.
I am talking about your benefit Umar.
I am sorry,
I am really angry.
There is no point trying to make her understand.
Leave it.
I am going home anyway.
Yes, no need to make her understand,
whatever I wanted to say to her, 
and whatever I wanted her to understand.
I have done that.
What does Maheen say?
Papa is going to come soon,
he will ask the same question.
Everyone will ask,
I will tell everyone together,
you too come to the party and hear it.
You make a mistake and then misbehave.
What mistake have I made?
I feel,
in fact, I strong believe that Maheen got
disappointed by your love and went back home.
The love that doesn’t die even after marriage.
You still meet that girl, right?
Brother, she has an issue with me, not that girl.
And before you blame me for everything,
hear this, she has blamed us all,
grandma, mama, papa,
me and you that we mistreat her together.
And the reason you think is true,
why didn’t she mention that?
What was the need to lie?
You tell me this.
This is what I don’t understand,
what was the need for her to say all this?
I understand it,
she hates me,
she hates me a lot and
she will do anything to stay away from me.
Why shouldn’t I have said it,
am I afraid of something?
My heart is bursting hearing all this,
and you are crying why I talked to him.
Mama, when I didn’t say all this to you,
then why did you say this to Umar.
Okay,
if you sit with your lips sealed, 
then should I also do the same.
Would I not find out?
What wrong did I say in this?
Didn’t Razia make you do all the work at home?
No.
Okay, and you had no issues with your pocket money,
Umar had not stopped giving you money.
There was no restriction on meeting people, right?
No.
Then why don’t you want to go back?
If there is nothing out of this,
then what is the real
complain you have from Umar?
I have no complain.
Okay, so you came to your
mother’s home happily, right?
Or do you want your mother to worry.
Mama, is it not enough that
I don’t want to live with him,
I don’t want to spend 
the rest of my life with him?
Umar.
Umar.
Yes mama.
Umar, come out, we need to talk.
My class is about to start.
I am accepting from my heart,
that I was wrong.
If kids marry out of their will, its better.
Now, why this sudden confession?
Look, I always got upset with Mansoor
that he got the wife he liked,
now see no matter how Najia is with us,
she is fine with Mansoor
and parents want that their children are happy.
She cares for Mansoor,
takes care of him, loves him,
so much so that
she agreed on his second wedding.
Okay, your wish has been fulfilled.
Oh God, why would I want that?
I just gave an example that
she really loves Mansoor and Mansoor 
won’t get a second wife with her being there.
Get me married again, I am ready.
Wow, hear him.
We have lost our sleep
in his worry and he is joking.
You cannot handle one and you will get another?
I am not joking papa,
you people were just talking that if parents take 
the decision of their children’s wedding its not that good,
but if children do it themselves its better.
I am saying the same, give me a chance.
You and your chances.
Everything is not supposed to be taken as a joke.
Should I take your dreams of a second wedding.
Mama, what is wrong with you?
You leave all this and tell me,
when is Maheen coming.
How would I know when is she coming.
You people go and bring her,
forcefully, and heating her.
You have been blamed anyway,
now show a demonstration of the same.
I don’t care if she comes back or not.
Hey,
what is this discussion about a second wedding?
Let him come again,
I will beat him up so much,
that he will remember the beating
he got in his childhood.
He was joking mama.
To hell with his jokes.
We are a joke in the community 
and he is fooling around.
Come here.
Come here.
What is it grandma?
Tell me,
Why did you mention of a second 
wedding in front of your parents?
I am going. Bye.
Sit, I will get breakfast.
No, I don’t want it, thank you.
Yes, the second wife must be waiting,
she will make him bread, he will eat it.
Hear this,
the taunts in this home never ends.
Look at this,
the wife has bothered him and
he is getting upset with his parents.
What have we said?
She didn’t fight with us and leave.
Look Razia,
Maheen is not a bad girl.
Its her mother,
she likes fighting
and till Maheen is there,
she will make her go insane.
But don’t worry,
I will go there myself and
make Maheen understand
and I will also fix the mind of that conspirator.
Leave it mama,
Fareed has told us not to.
He said he will go today or tomorrow.
Oh no, if he goes,
he will beg them and
agree to God knows what.
You go with him
or else God knows what that
conspirator will make him agree to.
Mama, you are right.
Yeah.
Fine.
No one takes me seriously.
I said something and everyone was after me.
What was the need for you to talk about
a second marriage from now on.
When would I do it, Roshni?
Earlier you said that I should do it sooner its getting late
and now you are saying something else.
If you talk about the second marriage right now,
then everyone will react.
She has fought and left home upset,
everyone will think that you talked
to Maheen about the second marriage
and that is why she left.
Brother and sister in law feel that way.
Yes,
then talk about this
when everything gets clear.
How will it get clear?
When the final decision is made.
When the divorce is done, then.
Divorce?
Yes, divorce.
Look,
till the time she is in your life,
everyone will react this way.
Once she leaves from your life,
what can anyone do?
What happened?
Nothing.
I am really happy,
that very soon the two of us will be one.
