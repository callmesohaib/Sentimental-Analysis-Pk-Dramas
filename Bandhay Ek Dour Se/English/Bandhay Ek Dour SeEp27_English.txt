Are you going to the hospital?
To meet uncle.
Yes.
I made food for him,
I will also come along.
Why?
Because I have to meet uncle,
ask him how he is.
Really?
You know he had given up
hope of your return.
He asked about you a lot,
so no need to do this favor on him now.
I have to apologize to him too.
That’s what you came here to say?
You know, you didn’t have a
good excuse to leave from here,
you didn’t even tell anyone,
apart from you disliking being with me.
Now have you thought of
a good excuse to come back?
Or the way you suddenly
didn’t like being with me,
you like being with me.
I just left, because I feared that
no one in this home needed me,
but its evident that everyone needs me,
so I came back.
No,
I still don’t need you.
I know and I also know that you have freed me
from all your rights and duties.
But with regards to everyone else,
I have some duties,
I have come to live up to those
and you cannot stop me from that.
You realized this really soon.
I realized it, Umar.
You just need to realize
and that is enough,
even if you realize it later.
Mama, earlier you were worried that
she has come to stay at her mother’s home,
now that she has left you are sitting here crying.
I am crying thinking what
she must be going through there.
I have seen Razia and mama’s manners,
they have poison in their
hearts for me and Maheen.
They will not be at peace
till they spit out the poison.
My daughter, she is so sensitive already,
what must she be going through.
Hey, she must have thought
about something and went.
After all, aunt and uncle were
angry on her not coming back,
now that she has gone back,
the anger will go.
It won’t go like that,
till the time they don’t
destroy her with their taunts,
their anger will not go.
Brother is still not home,
he is still in the hospital.
If he was home he would have made
the environment of the home worth living in.
What will my daughter do,
she is all alone with her in-laws?
She is not alone,
Umar is there with her.
Maheen, stop child,
daughters don’t look good apologizing.
Uncle, are you upset with me?
No, not at all.
Umar, see how she is losing it by crying like this.
Get her water.
Uncle, you please come home quickly, please.
Yes, my daughter is home now,
I will come home soon.
Right Umar?
Maheen, don’t worry child,
life is really long, okay?
Everything will be fine.
Show me how you smile.
Well done.
Umar.
Listen, you go to sleep,
this is not the time to walk on the roof,
you have to wake up in the morning
and go to the hospital and also to work.
I know,
but I cannot sleep here now.
I am going to aunt’s room anyway.
When did I say that
I cannot sleep here because of you.
It doesn’t matter to me
whether you go from here or not.
Did you hear me, it doesn’t matter to me.
That is really good,
because aunt needs me right now,
so I will sleep there for a few days.
Listen.
What?
Nothing Maheen.
Go!
Hello.
You are still up?
Yes.
Why didn’t you sleep?
I don’t know.
Because she has come back, that’s why?
Who?
She.
Umar, you said she would never come back
and you made me believe it,
so I came back.
I had left,
I was gone from between you two.
You brought her back.
Umar, why don’t you let me get on a side?
Roshni, I didn’t bring her back,
she came herself.
Because you left the door open, that’s why.
It’s a sign for people
who leave that when they want,
they can come back.
Why didn’t you close the door Umar?
Roshni, I don’t understand
what you are saying, right now.
Please, we will talk in the morning.
Oh,
why?
She is with you, that is why?
She is not with me. she is not here.
Hello.
Hello, Umar?
Hello.
She is not here,
but still why do I feel she is here,
near me.
I don’t even want your feeling.
Maheen.
Hey, Maheen.
Yes aunt?
This has been ringing on my head for so long.
Must be your mother’s.
She must be restless,
pick it up
and curse me to your heart’s content.
Hello mama.
Mama, you called so early in the morning
and woke up aunt.
What?
Was your phone in Razia’s room?
Yes, I went to give breakfast to aunt,
I was having tea with her,
so I left my phone there.
Oh Maheen,
my night was spent staying up and
thinking how you will be treated by your in-laws?
My heart was restless.
No, nothing like that,
everyone is treating me nicely and with love.
Thank God.
And Umar?
He must have shown that he is upset.
No,
but if he shows me he is upset,
I will tolerate it.
Well done child,
this is how an obedient wife is like.
Stay happy and may God
always keep you happy.
Come on go now, do your work.
When your uncle comes home,
I will come to meet him.
Okay?
Yes mama.
Bye.
Grandma.
Grandma,
should I make you breakfast?
Leave it,
Najia makes it daily,
she will make it today too.
You don’t worry.
But I have asked Najia
that she should rest now,
I am here
so I will do all the work at home
and when I am free,
I will go upstairs and help her too.
Should I make you breakfast?
You are not giving up Maheen,
so how can I?
I will see how long you can stand in front of me,
how many times will you come back?
I will force you to go back again and again.
What work have you gotten into?
Papa,
you should look good all the time,
and what are kids for?
They are here to care for you, right?
I spoke to the doctor
and he told me,
he will discharge you soon.
Thank God.
I will go in a little while and inform mama too.
Okay tell me,
is your mother treating
Maheen properly or not?
Or is she still upset?
At least she is not treating her
as badly as Maheen said about us.
Leave it son,
even tell Razia to take all this out of her heart,
she has come back, she is embarrassed.
Papa,
we will forget,
but will the rest of the people forget?
The whole family knows that we torment her,
although there is no truth behind this,
you people will get defamed so badly.
Whether I accepted her
my wife from my heart or not,
that is different,
but I never told her this,
nor made it evident that she is an unwanted…
What did you say Umar?
Unwanted relation?
This means you never accepted her
your wife with your heart?
Papa, I didn’t mean…
Whatever it is, that’s it.
You said what was in your heart.
It is an unwanted relation,
forced on to you.
I am sorry,
I tied you in this unwanted relation, forcefully.
I am sorry.
That it's.
Your mother has brought you up well.
Now see, girls of today,
they become friends, let them talk,
let them do fashion.
Who would come sit with
elder like this for so long.
Mama says that elders are a blessing,
you should take their prayers.
I came to get those.
Live long child, live long.
Stay happy.
Maheen, you are back.
When I went to your home,
I found out from aunt Zakia that you are back.
My home?
You are in my home, Roshni.
Okay, its good you considered this your home,
now be careful,
you change your thinking quickly.
Yes, you never know about her,
when she wants, she packs her bag and leave.
This time Razia is on the bed,
okay, use my name,
say that the grandma didn’t let you stay.
Shall we go?
Mama, hurry up I am getting late.
Yes,
here, this has been ironed for long.
I just went to get vegetables.
The vegetable is just an excuse
to talk to the neighbors, mama.
Okay, so what do I do?
I am alone, should I talk to the walls?
I will go to your in-laws in the evening today
and come back after fixing your wedding date.
Mama, I will be late in the evening,
I will also go meet uncle.
Yes, fine. Fine.
Go to their home as well,
we will also find out how Maheen is.
We went yesterday
and we came back from there yesterday, mama.
Can I tell you one thing,
I don’t like going to my sister’s home this often.
You call her, you will be at peace.
Yes, Roshni will tell me how she is,
she went to meet her today.
She went there?
Yes, her mother told me,
I met her at the vegetable shop just now.
Why did she go there?
Why did she go?
To meet her.
To find out about her mother in law’s health,
she is her friend.
What friend?
Maheen was here for so many days,
but I didn’t see her coming to meet Maheen,
however, we are next door neighbors,
but she went to meet her so far.
Wow.
Why do you get so weird
when Roshni’s name is taken.
Question after question.
I don’t know mama,
there is something weird.
What?
Don’t you think so?
I mean, they were such good
friends before the wedding,
they used to meet a lot
and after the wedding they have gone quiet.
When they talk they talk like strangers.
Okay, I agree there are ups
and downs in friendship,
these things happen.
But one thing that
I don’t understand is that,
after marriage, the Roshni
that stays away from Maheen,
why is she getting so close to her in-laws?
Bye.
Bye.
I am really happy to see you here.
Really?
And I am happier to know
that you have become smart
and you can take your own decisions.
And this decision you took after thinking hard,
after seeing your gain and loss.
Wow.
What benefit?
Which gain?
First time the groom went away from the door,
divorce the second time,
who would have asked
about you the third time, Maheen?
You don’t have education,
nor any wealth from your father,
and an average face.
In this moment, losing a husband like
Umar would have been stupidity,
which is something you didn’t do.
Now see,
without respect you can survive,
but to live a life you need to set your feet,
that is what you have done.
Now whether Umar loves you or not,
it doesn’t matter.
Wrong.
I took this decision with my heart too,
seeing gain and benefit is your habit, Roshni,
not mine.
And your second guess about me is wrong too,
I don’t have to set
my feet anywhere to live my life,
husband, home, in-laws,
these are part of my life for sure,
but not the most important mission of my life.
I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
To get a husband or in other words,
to get a man,
a person can pass any limit.
What limit did I cross?
I left Umar for you,
you came back to get the bounty,
you are calling me a girl with an ordinary thinking,
what are you, yourself?
Even tolerating a man’s dislike you
want to make a place in his life.
And when you were unable to make a place,
then you want to make a place
for yourself in this home.
I told you,
to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
for me, other things matter too,
like relations,
faithfulness,
trust,
and friendship.
And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
They are not just my in-laws, Roshni,
they are my own, my family.
And Umar,
he is not just my husband,
he is also my childhood friend,
my partner since childhood
and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
I am saying all this…
What all this?
Huh?
I know it all,
I have understood it
and very soon Umar too will understand.
This was deceit,
that he considered love, is a big deceit.
You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
You lied to him,
and that poor thing,
he didn’t lie, you did.
He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
Umar…
I made a mistake,
but I love Umar even today.
Stop it Roshni,
now,
I can’t trust you,
I don’t believe you even this much.
You kept me and Umar in the dark, all of us.
Now how do I trust you,
you left him for betterment for someone else,
so you will leave him again.
You have the courage to break his heart once,
then you cam have the courage again.
I don’t trust you at all.
And yes,
I have come back,
not to get Umar,
but to save him.
I am sad that
one decision of mine,
maybe ruined Umar’s life, maybe.
Don’t think like that papa.
This is one thought
that is bothering me every moment.
When I see him caring
for me with his head down,
it hurts me in the heart.
Where did that smile of his go?
His showing off? His stupidity?
It all got lost due to wrong decision of mine.
Maheen has come back now,
it will all be fine now.
No Mansoor,
I have seen him entangled when Maheen left
and I saw him suffocated
when Maheen came back.
Seeing Maheen, I cannot say that
she came back because of Umar,
she has come back because of his uncle,
or for the world outside.
Why do you say such hopeless things?
Mansoor, I don’t want to disappoint Umar,
that his father ruined his happiness,
didn’t care for his happiness.
Look, you and Najia,
talk to both of them,
ask them what they want,
try to find out that
is there space for each
other in their hearts or not.
Mansoor…
Ok. Ok. I will do it. I will do it.
Okay,
don’t worry, relax.
That’s it.
Here.
Did your friend leave?
Yes.
You should have asked her to stay for food.
Don’t worry Grandma,
I sent her after caring for her a lot.
But she came to meet Razia,
why did she leave without meeting her?
Look Maheen,
this friend of yours looks suspicious to me,
stay away from her.
I will stay away from her,
but grandma,
you should also not talk about
family matters in front of her.
I don’t want these strangers
to talk about my home.
Now you are not as stupid as I thought,
after all, you are our blood,
but you are the one
who started this secret talk.
You forgot?
Grandma, ask your heart, can I do this?
So this means, that girl was lying?
But why?
She has the answer for this why.
But anyway leave it,
what had to happen, happened,
we need to be careful going forward.
You have become really smart.
I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
To get a husband or in other words,
to get a man,
a person can pass any limit.
to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
for me, other things matter too,
like relations,
faithfulness,
trust,
and friendship.
And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
Umar is not just my husband,
he is also my childhood friend,
my partner since childhood
and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
You lied to him,
and that poor thing,
he didn’t lie, you did.
He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
I am back,
but not to get Umar,
but to save him.
Oh God, what will I reply to his questions?
I didn’t even think of an excuse,
how was I to know…
You now prepare to go home.
Thank God.
Here.
Mama is at home to give you company,
she cannot have this diet food alone.
Now you will have diet food
and she will too.
Its fine, right?
Yes.
Made by Maheen?
I don’t know.
That’s fine.
You go and do your work,
Mansoor is here,
when you come back,
we will go home together.
Okay.
Thank you.
I have been asking you for so long,
let me shampoo your hair, brush it,
I finally had to force you.
You leave it, I will do it myself.
Not at all,
you will sit here peacefully,
I will make your hair, then uncle will come.
after that I have to go help out sister in law too.
I feel really bad,
that after Najia gave me such a big good news,
instead of me caring for her,
taking care of her wishes,
I am on the bed myself,
but these days you have really cared for Najia.
Now I am thinking,
when you leave, we will be in a tough spot.
So don’t make us get used to your comfort.
This...
I am not going.
I am not going anywhere.
How are you?
I will talk to you later.
Bye. Bye.
I am coming home.
Fine. Fine.
Yes Monis, come you can meet papa.
Oh,
no,
I didn’t come here to see how you care for me,
in fact, I will make tea for you and myself…
No, no, leave it. Keep sitting.
Even the doctor didn’t instruct me to sit so much.
What do you want?
I sit here and do nothing.
You  have to see mama too.
Yes, so I just have to see her,
what else do I have to do,
we have a maid,
there is a washing machine,
the home is cleaned,
I just have to take care of the kitchen
and that is not much work,
that is no work, if I don’t do that even,
then what is the benefit of me being here?
You only came here to benefit us?
No, there is another reason.
Umar?
I was going to the kitchen to make tea
and you got me talking here.
Maheen,
everything was fine between you and Umar,
at least it seemed ok.
Sister in law, just think I was being stupid,
I was going to get a big loss,
I listened to people and…
now I am back.
To fix everything and
by the will of God it will all be fine.
God willing.
