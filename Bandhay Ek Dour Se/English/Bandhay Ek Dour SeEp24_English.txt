I am accepting from my heart,
that I was wrong.
If kids marry out of their will, its better.
Now, why this sudden confession?
Look, I always got upset with Mansoor
that he got the wife he liked,
now see no matter how Najia is with us,
she is fine with Mansoor
and parents want that their children are happy.
She cares for Mansoor,
takes care of him, loves him,
so much so that
she agreed on his second wedding.
Okay, your wish has been fulfilled.
Oh God, why would I want that?
I just gave an example that
she really loves Mansoor and Mansoor
won’t get a second wife with her being there.
Get me married again, I am ready.
Wow, hear him.
We have lost our sleep
in his worry and he is joking.
You cannot handle one and you will get another?
I am not joking papa,
you people were just talking that if parents take
the decision of their children’s wedding its not that good,
but if children do it themselves its better.
I am saying the same, give me a chance.
You and your chances.
Everything is not supposed to be taken as a joke.
Should I take your dreams of a second wedding.
Mama, what is wrong with you?
You leave all this and tell me,
when is Maheen coming.
How would I know when is she coming.
You people go and bring her,
forcefully, and heating her.
You have been blamed anyway,
now show a demonstration of the same.
I don’t care if she comes back or not.
Hey,
what is this discussion about a second wedding?
Let him come again,
I will beat him up so much,
that he will remember the beating
he got in his childhood.
He was joking mama.
To hell with his jokes.
We are a joke in the community
and he is fooling around.
Come here.
Come here.
What is it grandma?
Tell me,
Why did you mention of a second
wedding in front of your parents?
I am going. Bye.
Sit, I will get breakfast.
No, I don’t want it, thank you.
Yes, the second wife must be waiting,
she will make him bread, he will eat it.
Hear this,
the taunts in this home never ends.
Look at this,
the wife has bothered him and
he is getting upset with his parents.
What have we said?
She didn’t fight with us and leave.
Look Razia,
Maheen is not a bad girl.
Its her mother,
she likes fighting
and till Maheen is there,
she will make her go insane.
But don’t worry,
I will go there myself and
make Maheen understand
and I will also fix the mind of that conspirator.
Leave it mama,
Fareed has told us not to.
He said he will go today or tomorrow.
Oh no, if he goes,
he will beg them and
agree to God knows what.
You go with him
or else God knows what that
conspirator will make him agree to.
Mama, you are right.
Yeah.
Fine.
No one takes me seriously.
I said something and everyone was after me.
What was the need for you to talk about
a second marriage from now on.
When would I do it, Roshni?
Earlier you said that I should do it sooner its getting late
and now you are saying something else.
If you talk about the second marriage right now,
then everyone will react.
She has fought and left home upset,
everyone will think that you talked
to Maheen about the second marriage
and that is why she left.
Brother and sister in law feel that way.
Yes,
then talk about this
when everything gets clear.
How will it get clear?
When the final decision is made.
When the divorce is done, then.
Divorce?
Yes, divorce.
Look,
till the time she is in your life,
everyone will react this way.
Once she leaves from your life,
what can anyone do?
What happened?
Nothing.
I am really happy,
that very soon the two of us will be one.
Maheen, move out of the way,
don’t disturb me.
See.
Oh, out!
I am bored.
If you are bored,
sit with me and watch the match.
You know I don’t like cricket.
Yeah, yeah of course.
You like games like cards, ludo,
the games you can play sitting.
Game for lazy girls.
I don’t play them now.
There is no one to play with me here.
Okay, lets do one thing.
Come on, I will play with you.
Really?
And your match?
Hey, it will be re-telecasted,
I will watch it again.
Come, lets play.
You know I will beat you so badly,
that you will take the name of ludo again.
No, no one can defeat me in ludo.
You will regret.
You are the one who will regret,
that I wish I had not played this game.
Come on.
You win this game Umar,
I give you permission.
Its not dead.
Its still not dead.
See it.
Umar, you see it?
I see it, I see it well.
I play so well.
Really good.
Why isn’t it going right? 
Why isn’t it going right?
Look, look. See here…
Do you even have a little shame?
I have been trying like mad
for the past 15 minutes.
Who is asking you to try?
You are ill mannered.
Okay leave it, it will get destroyed.
Leave it Maheen. Leave it.
Ill mannered. Fraud.
You are calling your husband,
your allegoric God,
ill mannered and a fraud
and you are hitting him too.
Don’t you dare.
Who is my allegoric God?
Yes, me.
You are my allegoric God?
Yes, me.
Allegoric God.
You were committing such a big sin.
Allegoric God.
Allegoric God.
I will just now tell grandma.
No, okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
I want to talk to you Maheen.
Brother, I have to give tea to mama.
Look, I don’t want to talk in front of mama.
And if there is something
that you don’t want to tell her
because she will get hurt,
then at least tell me.
I have made her sad,
even when I didn’t wanted to.
Not just her,
you are sad yourself too, Maheen.
On one hand you don’t want to go back,
you don’t want to live with Umar
and on the other hand,
all your night is spent crying.
The decision that is hurting you so much,
I want to know the reason behind it.
Brother, don’t ask me so many questions,
I have told you what was there.
You have not told me anything
and what we have found from another source,
you are denying it.
If there is nothing like that then tell us,
aunt and uncle are coming, what do we say to them?
Uncle?
Yes,
he called, he is on his way.
That is why I want to talk to you,
that tell me what it is.
Look if you don’t want to go back,
or it is not possible for you to live there,
I should have something to say.
This isn’t enough that I say to them
that you don’t want to go there.
Maheen.
I have to give tea to mama.
Yes, go ahead Maheen, what is it now?
Why are you crying?
Stop crying and tell me what happened?
Oh,
mama and papa.
That is why I am thinking
why papa didn’t come along.
So then say it to them,
tell them what you told me.
Tell them that you don’t want to live with me.
You have already told me, 
now you cannot say it in front of them?
Maheen, open the door.
What is this childish behaviour.
Maheen, open the door I say.
Aunt, what is this noise about?
What do I tell you, she is driving me mad,
a new drama everyday.
Now, tell me,
you said that she is not treated well at the in-laws
and even Umar is not fine with her, right?
Yes, but what happened?
I talked to them about this there,
she got upset.
Now her uncle and aunt are coming to talk,
she has locked the room and
sitting inside saying she won’t meet them.
If she doesn’t meet them,
then how will we make truce?
They are coming for truce?
Obviously, that is what elders are for that
if something wrong happens in the home,
there is some issue,
then they sit and solve the issue,
what else are they there for?
But see if she doesn’t meet,
then how will things progress.
You don’t worry, I will talk to her.
You don’t worry, you go.
Yes, talk to her, she listens to you.
Maheen, open the door.
Maheen.
What happened?
Why are you not opening the door,
is everything ok?
Mama.
Mama.
Oh, lower your voice,
grandma is sleeping, she has a headache.
You tell me, where is mama and papa?
I don’t know I just came from work,
I gave grandma tea and medicine,
now I am going up.
Did you not ask grandma where they are?
No, I didn’t ask her.
You will say this and I will believe you.
You know well where they went,
to Maheen’s home,
to convince her, to aunt.
Hey, I really don’t know and even if they have gone,
what issue do you have?
What issue will I have?
I am only thinking why they are hiding this from me,
what is the secrecy in this.
Its possible they felt
that you wont let them go
and you don’t want that
Maheen comes back to this home.
I don’t want it?
What is wrong with you sister in law?
How do I make you people believe that
she doesn’t want to come back here.
Not once, she has said this a thousand time
that she doesn’t want to come here.
Okay fine,
she has said no a thousand times,
then she will say the same
thing in front of mama and papa,
what are you worried about?
I am worried as to why mama and
papa are interested in hearing Maheen say no.
What was the need for them to go there?
When Maheen said this to me clearly
that she wants a divorce
and now when she will say
this in front of mama and papa,
then they will be hurt.
Were you hurt too?
Speak up.
Answer me.
Were you hurt,
is that the reason you are upset?
Why would I get hurt?
What have you done to yourself?
I feel sorry for you.
When Umar sees you his heart will soften.
That poor thing shows sympathy to anyone.
Sympathy,
feeling sorry?
What have I done to myself?
I have taken this decision to fix my condition,
because I don’t want anyone to feel sorry
or show sympathy to me.
I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
I know this, not those people.
They just want that you and Umar…
unless they don’t find a valid reason,
they will try to ensure that
there is peace between you two.
That is why you told them that false reasoning.
Me?
You know why I am not stepping out of the room,
why I am hiding inside the room?
Because I wont be able to face uncle and aunty.
Roshni, what was the need to say
that they treat me badly,
and now Umar also thinks
the same about me that I said this and
I cannot say anything because of you,
because he will think that
I am creating a misunderstanding in his heart for you,
because he is already thinking like this.
One second, I understood you.
I will tell him
that I said all of this
and I said it for the betterment of you two,
I didn’t have any bad intentions.
That poor man is scared
that in this separation you 
might take his and my name.
He will be in trouble.
He tried his best to keep you happy
and so did I,
just for our friendship, for our sake.
I decided to leave Umar’s life.
Nobody needs to do anything for my sake.
I don’t want to take further favors from you two
and whatever Umar did for me,
I will pay back Umar’s favors as well.
I will not let the name of you
two come in this whole story.
But Maheen,
all this will happen
when you talk to them straight forwardly.00:20:55.02]
You tell them your decision.
Look Maheen,
you will have to choose one side,
make your life easy and
also make Umar’s life easy.
He is only suffering because of you.
Umar,
you didn’t answer my question.
Did you feel hurt?
When she asked for a divorce,
did you not feel any pain?
Why would I feel pain, sister in law,
when she is happy?
She should have been hurt.
If she is happy, then so am I.
Okay,
then why is your tone 
so broken while talking about this.
Why is there so much disappointment,
so much loneliness on your face,
that you get from the fear of losing someone.
Sister in law, there is no loneliness on my face,
you have started your speculations again, all wrong.
I am going from here.
Umar,
at least answer me.
Does the empty room not bother you,
all your night is spent walking on the roof,
how long will you hide?
And from whom will you hide it from?
Will you hide it from yourself too?
Monis.
Yes?
Monis, find out,
where are your uncle and aunt,
 they left a long time back,
have they changed their 
mind about coming here.
Its good that they don’t come,
after all, she is sitting upset
and when we cannot talk about anything, 
what result will we get?
No, no, she is getting better, 
she came out of the room,
she is ready to talk to her uncle and aunt.
I think Roshni made her understand.
Roshni.
Mama, did Roshni tell you the complains
 Maheen has with Umar and her in-laws?
No, not me, she told her mother.
She mentioned it to me so I found out,
or else Maheen is so cunning
 she kept it inside her heart.
and Maheen said all this to Roshni.
Obviously,
she shared her sorrow with her friend,
she didn’t tell her mother anything.
Anyway, you find out, where are those people.
Does the empty room not bother you,
all your night is spent walking on the roof,
how long will you hide?
And from whom will you hide it from?
Will you hide it from yourself too?
I am not hiding anything from anyone,
I have no pain, it doesn’t matter to me
 whether she is in my life or not.
Speak up brother Mansoor,
you too say what sister in law is saying is correct.
You two…
What?
What are you saying brother Mansoor?
How?
Where are mama and papa?
I am coming.
Oh my God, God help.
No uncle,
I won’t go back.
I not only respect you, I really love you also,
but this wish of yours, I cannot fulfill it.
You please,
don’t consider this my stubbornness,
consider it my helplessness
and
just think that living with Umar is no less 
than a punishment for me.
If you help me,
then both families will be saved from destruction.
But please, don’t force me.
I know that…
I know you are really hurt to hear this,
but please,
you also try and understand I had to put 
a stone on my heart and say this to you.
Are they here?
Stay with me.
Come on.
Uncle and aunt had an accident.
Umar called.
What?
The ankle is displaced,
thank God its not a fracture,
God have mercy,
the doctor has recommended bed rest for some time.
And papa,
his operation is going on for so long,
 is everything ok?
He has serious injuries,
I hope God is kind.
You shouldn’t have got grandma here, 
she is crying so much.
What are you saying Mansoor,
she was crying so much at home, 
we are all here we will console her.
I pray to God before mama regains consciousness, 
papa’s operation is completed,
we give her a good news.
Everything will be fine. 
Did anyone inform aunt and Maheen.
Yes I did.
Oh God.
Brother, sister in law, what happened?
Umar.
Where are mama and papa?
Umar. Umar, pray.
 Papa is in the operation theatre.
is everything ok? Mama. Where is mama?
Be strong. 
We are shifting mama to the room.
Be strong.
Tell me honestly.
I am telling you honestly.
Everything is fine Umar. 
You pray. Everything is fine.
You just pray.
Be strong and pray, by the will of God it will all be fine.
Umar,
just pray, ok?
Yes, it’s a black gate. Yes, this is it. 
We are coming. Hurry up mama.
Hey, oh God, I am getting so tensed.
I don’t know what to do in tension.
I am dropping things, God have mercy.
God have mercy.
Maheen, lock the door.
One minute. One minute.
Brother wait a minute, 
I will get my shawl I am also coming.
No but…
Okay fine, hurry up. We are already late.
I was just saying that after she left home, 
the whole family must know.
Now everyone will come to meet them, 
they will say things to her.
So what mama?
I cannot stop myself out of the fear of people talking 
and leave uncle and aunt like this.
Come on mama, 
nothing will happen. Lets go.
Okay.
Lock the door.
Come quickly.
What happened? All ok?
Nothing is ok.
Maheen’s in-laws were coming to our home,
they had an accident on the way, 
they are in the hospital.
God have mercy.
Yes, you just pray.
Hurry up mama.
and take care of the home.
Yes. Yes.
Aunt pray. Come on, man.
God have mercy.
Oh God, mama, how are they?
Why have you come now Zakia? 
To see the show?
Why would I come to see the show mama? 
What are you saying?
Brother Fareed is my brother,
he is the shade on the heads of my orphan children, 
may this shadow always stay on our head.
yes, that is why you called him to beg you,
and he too was coming to beg you, 
to request your children.
Grandma, stop it, it’s a hospital.
You sit. Sit down.
Tell her to leave from here.
You sit.
Go from here, 
let me pray peacefully for my children.
You sit.
Get lost.
Grandma he is equally dear to us as he is to you.
Uncle is our support too,
that is why we are praying for him too.
Umar, what did the doctor say?
We will find out after the operation,
all of you please pray.
Okay my son, be quiet.
I am coming.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you coming from aunt Zakia’s home?
Yes.
What did you talk about? 
did you find out something?
No, there is no news, because those 
people have not returned from the hospital.
But you should have at least called them.
I am calling Umar, 
he is not picking up my phone.
Why are you calling Umar, call Maheen.
I called Maheen, but her phone was off
and Umar’s parents had an accident,
I will call him.
God have mercy,
may God keep the shade of the elders always.
But because of this accident Maheen went back,
maybe their condition will get better now.
What happened?
What did she got upset?
Umar.
Umar.
What happened?
Papa’s operation is successful, 
he is out of danger.
Thank God.
Why are you people lying?
Tell me honestly, how is he now?
Aunt.
He is fine.
He is fine, trust me.
The doctor said he will be fine, 
our prayers worked.
Oh God, thank you so much.
But I,
I have become a handicapped 
and will be bed ridden.
Hey mama, 
why are you thinking like this?
Death is better than such a life of handicap.
Why are you saying these damned things, Razia.
Don’t give me fake hope.
Its better that
God calls me to him instead of living on 
someone’s support for the rest of my life.
Aunt, the doctor said you will be fine, 
you just need to rest.
Don’t give me fake hope.
Okay, I will do one thing, 
I will call the doctor,
he will tell you himself that 
nothing happened to you, everything is fine.
The doctor will say whatever you told him.
I know I am not fine.
Okay fine, go, call the doctor.
Sister in law, what happened?
Are you ok?
I don’t know I just felt dizzy.
Sit.
Sit.
I am fine, I will go and call the doctor.
Umar,
man, don’t worry, 
uncle will regain consciousness,
ok?
I will go and drop Maheen and mama home, 
then I will come back to you.
No, you don’t need to come back, its ok.
What happened sister in law? 
Are you ok?
What happened?
Nothing, I just took her to the doctor,
her BP is a little low, 
she has not eaten anything since morning.
I am fine.
You take sister in law home,
you go home and rest sister in law, 
Grandma is alone at home too.
No, who will stay with mama?
I am here.
No, its important for you to stay with papa.
Najia, Umar is right, we cannot leave 
grandma alone at home,
you should stay at home with her,
this way you will get to rest a little too.
No,
mama is really worried,
and I don’t know why she feels 
we are hiding something from her.
I cannot leave her alone like this,
someone has to stay 
with her in this condition.
I will stay.
I will stay with aunt, 
you go home and rest sister in law.
Papa.
Papa.
Please open your eyes,
talk to me.
Forgive me papa.
Forgive me.
I have really bothered you.
I will not do it again.
I promise you, 
I will accept anything you say,
I will not go against 
any decision you take for me.
Please forgive me.
Just open your eyes,
papa, I am dying to hear your voice.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Umar.
