If it was just about Umar,
we would have beaten him up
and made him understand,
but we are upset with her,
she is supporting Umar.
She has almost convinced her father in law.
Zakia, talk to your daughter,
make her understand,
I am worried that she will leave
alone taking her husband as a groom.
We have been made fun of,
people have cursed us,
but Zakia, you too will have to get
your daughter sit at home.
She doesn’t want to live in her home,
she wants others to live in that home.
Mama.
What are you doing?
Get out of my way.
Leave her. Leave her.
Leave me.
Leave her Zakia. Leave her.
Stop Zakia. Leave her.
Zakia, stop it.
You are my son in law,
so I cannot raise my hand on you.
Or else what her fault is,
you have a bigger mistake.
Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
Umar. Umar, take her inside,
Zakia will kill her.
You should have thought of this earlier,
you are calling aunt Zakia,
and complaining about her,
this will happen.
Everyone hear me clearly,
no one punish Maheen for what I did.
Come on Maheen.
This girl has ruined me.
she has ruined my peace, Umar too.
I will get water.
Yes.
Relax.
Maheen.
Maheen, I am sorry.
Maheen, sorry, 
all this is because of me.
No.
No.
all this is because of me,
had I not come in your way,
your path would have been easier.
But I too have ruined your path because of me,
I am so selfish,
I did something so wrong,
for my work, for myself, I put you in front.
You got blamed for everything.
To be honest, I felt that if you agree,
the whole family would agree easily
or else they might never agree.
But I didn’t know all this would happen.
Okay, please stop crying Maheen.
I am not crying because of you,
I am crying because of my mother.
I never wanted to hurt her,
but I gave her pain.
Even I never wanted to hurt you,
but I did.
I am not hurt Umar,
I am fine.
Sorry Maheen.
You have to hear so much,
you have to go through so much.
Now no more.
I…
I will fight my battle myself.
I am sorry.
What was the need to raise your hand on the daughter,
what is her fault in it?
How do I raise my hand on
the one who is at fault, brother?
The one whose responsibility it is
to raise his hand on, he has given up.
What do you mean?
Is there just one solution for all problems?
Raising your hand on your young children?
But brother, at least give me enough permission
to stop Maheen from doing what she is doing.
If the wife gets stubborn,
especially when the in-laws are standing with her,
then the husband won’t
dare go anywhere else.
This thankless girl doesn’t see this
that the in-laws are with her,
she is willing to ruin her life herself.
Okay sister in law,
I will leave now.
I have one request with
you people to stand with her,
put some sense into her head.
This widow doesn’t have the courage to see
my divorced daughter standing at my door now.
God forbid Zakia.
Brother, I don’t know
why you are taking Umar’s side,
what is your helplessness,
I just know that I gave you my daughter,
its your responsibility to make her settle down in this home,
if you send her back,
I will kill her and die myself too.
Zakia…
Bad time has come on me today,
you left me,
you left me alone,
stopped talking to me.
You got upset with me yourself
and now you are being stubborn.
Mama was right,
men like you consider a girl a toy
and play with her emotions,
you have shown your
true colors really soon, Umar.
I was just a temporary entertainment for you,
you just wanted to play,
you wanted to enjoy, you did that,
and now you left me, right?
You did wrong with me, Umar.
You did really wrong.
And you have left me alone at this time.
I am all alone.
You had said your friendship
with Maheen is the same,
then ask Maheen as a friend who she likes,
who is in her heart.
Please Roshni…
Look, listen. Listen to me,
this way you will not be blamed alone,
you can tell your family
that Maheen’s will was in it,
because Maheen likes someone else.
Roshni, open the door.
Open the door.
Mama, leave.
Open the door.
Mama, I don’t want to talk, leave.
Open the door, I am telling you.
You wanted to hit me, 
you have done that,
I don’t want to talk about anything else now.
Open the door, I am telling you.
My phone!
Leave my phone!
Sit down!
I have had enough.
I won’t let you do this.
What actions?
We like each other,
we want to get married,
 what is wrong in that?
Shut your mouth!
You have any idea,
he is a married man
and that too your friend Maheen’s husband.
You have some consideration and
 shame for your friendship or not?
Look at me,
I have so much consideration
 and shame for the neighbors.
You tell me,
when everyone finds out,
 then how will we face her mother.
Maheen knows everything.
Nothing is hidden from Maheen.
When I used to tell you that 
I am going to meet Maheen,
I was not lying,
Umar used to be with her.
She has been making us meet.
It doesn’t matter to her.
Now do you feel like hitting me?
Do you? Here, hit me. 
Hit me as much as you like.
I will hit you!
What am I hearing?
What are you saying that 
Maheen let her husband…
oh God,
Maheen is spoiling my daughter
and I am quiet because of 
consideration and shame.
I will not leave Zakia,
 you will see what I do to her now!
Mama, do what you want,
but return my phone.
No.
Give me my phone.
You won’t get this phone
and if you argue with me
 further you will get beaten again.
I will get you married within this week!
Come on the right track, or I…
Mama. Mama!
Why did she switch off her phone?
What do I do?
Hey, are you keeping an eye on me,
that when I come to the roof 
and you come to make fun of me.
All this is not right Umar,
the thing has left the home.
I know man,
her mother has found out,
I don’t know how she must be treating her.
All this has happened because of you.
Aunt had to find out,
but she took out all her anger on Maheen.
I am not talking about Maheen,
I am talking about Roshni, 
her mother has found out.
Roshni?
Roshni?
Who Roshni?
I don’t know how her 
family must be treating her,
I am giving her sorrow.
Just her?
The whole family has received 
a lot of happiness from you?
The whole house is awake Umar,
no one has sleep in their eyes.
And aunt Zakia,
she must have a mourning in her home.
And you,
what was the name of that girl,
yes, Roshni.
You are worried about Roshni?
I am worried about everyone.
I am worried for everyone.
I don’t want to hurt anyone,
but the problem is no one is happy with me.
What do I do?
Brother Mansoor the truth
 is I am the most worried right now.
You and worried?
I wish you realized this Umar.
I wish.
Yes,
did you console him?
Did you wipe his tears?
For God’s sake Najia, go to sleep.
You are a man,
your sympathies will be a man,
yours and sadly papa’s as well.
Nothing like that Najia,
papa just wants to handle this 
matter with patience and care.
Leave it. Leave it.
He just stops at the point when he says 
that he forcefully got Umar married.
Like he did something really wrong.
Now he will make amends for it too,
getting a bride Umar likes.
Najia,
the doctor has told you not to 
take tension without a reason,
so you stay away from this matter.
Rest, come on.
Why?
Why should I stay away from this matter?
Sympathies with Maheen is another thing.
It is a matter of principle.
I will not let this happen in this home
because the wrong custom is 
being created in this home.
Today Umar is doing it, 
tomorrow you will find a reason.
Najia, I don’t want to argue with you
 and make your BP shoot in this condition.
So please let me be.
I will not let leave that girl.
Once I find out who she is, 
you will see what I do with her.
Her name is Roshni,
Umar just told me.
Now you go and find out yourself, 
but not right now,
let me sleep right now.
Now you too sleep.
Umar.
I want to go to mama’s home today,
I cannot stop myself 
after seeing her upset yesterday.
I will go and convince her somehow, 
just drop me there.
Maheen, I don’t think you going
 there would be right today.
You please let the situation get under control.
What will she do?
Hit me more.
Fine, she can hit me, she is my mother.
And after all, 
the anger in her heart will be removed.
You know there is love even 
in the beating of a mother.
I will meet her, 
maybe she might get better.
No, its not that,
I feel that
Roshni’s mother has found 
out about me and Roshni.
What?
I think.
I feel this.
Its not been that
Roshni phone has been off for so long
and if this is true,
and if you go there you 
will have to face a lot.
God knows what is going on there.
Let it be confirmed.
I don’t know if I read her message wrong,
 I don’t understand anything.
Its more important for me to go in this situation,
God knows what aunt must be saying to mama,
I don’t know what her heart must be going through.
She must not be alone at this time.
Maheen, I will take you in the evening, myself.
Please.
Papa, I was just going, 
I thought I would say bye to you.
Huh?
Yeah.
Umar, I was thinking that I come with 
you in a day or two, I have rested enough.
No papa, the doctor has said 
that we cannot burden you,
I mean till you get fine.
If there is something let me know.
Umar, there is a question.
Go ahead, papa.
I accept you have been mistreated,
I also accept that
its your religious right 
whatever you are asking for,
but still I have a request.
Umar, can you not step back?
Can you not forget everything?
For us?
For Maheen?
Papa, tell me something.
Tying someone in the strings of promises
if someone steps back, 
what sort of a person is he?
You didn’t bring us up like this.
I promised to that girl
that I will bring her with respect.
If I don’t live up to my promise,
then
I am not capable of giving her respect.
I am a cheater, right?
I cannot do this papa.
Maybe,
maybe, I might have done it for Maheen’s sake,
but she has no such demands.
She didn’t say this to me, ever.
I don’t think it matter to her,
that I have someone else in my life.
It doesn’t matter to her at all.
Her name is Roshni,
Umar just told me.
Roshni?
Oh God,
a face comes in front of 
my eyes hearing that name,
but I don’t remember.
I had a heavy heart since last night,
I didn’t mention it to you,
because in anger you might have…
I told you something so big,
are you not surprised or angry?
I was surprised mama,
I even got angry,
when I found out about this the first time.
What do you mean?
You knew this from earlier and
 you were hiding it from me?
Mama, Maheen made me promise.
She asked for a few days that 
she will fix everything in this time.
I didn’t know she was asking 
time for Umar’s wedding.
I don’t know what is wrong with this girl.
She got everything served to her.
That is why she doesn’t respect it.
I am shocked how easily 
she is giving her husband to a stranger.
She is no stranger
and Maheen is not giving him,
she is snatching him away.
I am surprised and angry at Maheen,
that why has she given Roshni this freedom.
What?
What?
Roshni?
Roshni.
Oh my God.
Razia has given up,
but I won’t.
Find out that girl’s name and address,
the both of us will go and insult her.
Hey grandma, half of the work is done,
don’t worry, I will find out the address too.
Talk to this Maheen.
She doesn’t understand me,
nor does her mother’s beating affect her.
If you talk to her like a friend,
then she might understand.
Friend?
Yes, you become a friend and talk to her.
One minute grandma,
friend,
Maheen’s friend,
that lives in her locality.
Roshni!
Yes, so?
She is the one.
Her?
You have any idea with 
how much difficulty I am calling you,
mama has snatched my phone too.
I was also thinking that 
you would be in some difficulty.
I am not in a difficulty right now,
but if you don’t take a step,
 then there will be a difficulty.
I will have to handle 
the matters at both ends.
My family was upset with me,
now your mother is upset with you.
You bring the proposal once, Umar.
Then I will see how my mother says no.
She is my mother, so what, 
will she be the god of my fate too?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, Umar?
I think someone came to him.
What will she do?
She will hit me more, 
fine she can hit me,
she is my mother.
Its good, the anger in her 
heart will be taken out.
You know there is love
in a mother’s beating even.
I will meet her,
maybe things will get better.
What sort of a mother are you?
Don’t you see your daughter’s actions?
You have left her free to ruin 
the homes of other people.
Lower your voice Zakia,
don’t create a scene of me in this locality.
Your daughter has created a scene, 
for your respect.
If you worried so much,
you should have taught us
 how to safeguard respect.
Don’t let me open my mouth, Zakia.
Monis had doubts earlier,
he used to say mama, 
Roshni’s actions don’t seem right,
why does she run away to Maheen’s in-laws?
I was mad,
I used to tell him that she is Maheen’s friend, 
she must go in her love,
I didn’t know she went there in his love,
she goes to ruin her friend’s home,
 to take her right.
Roshni didn’t go,
but Maheen used to take my daughter’s 
hand and take her along.
I should complain to you,
that what your married daughter is
 making my unmarried daughter do.
You don’t believe me, right?
Wait, let me call her, you ask her yourself.
Call her.
Call her.
Roshni.
Roshni.
Its useless to argue, mama.
I have made my decision.
Oh God, Fareed, what is wrong with you?
What sort of decisions are you taking?
You should have 
at least thought about Maheen.
Mama,
if Maheen stands up for her right,
I will support her too, but…
I have made my decision,
but I have not told Umar
 about this decision.
First I will talk to Maheen for the last time,
if she agrees,
then I will put this decision 
and condition in front of Umar.
I found out everything,
she used to do all this in front of you 
and you kept on seeing it.
She is your friend, right?
What do you want?
This is not a movie from the seventies that 
two friends changes their veil and share a man.
Sister in law, you don’t know 
the whole thing, you please stop it.
What does I not know?
What does I not know? Tell me.
Its Roshni,
hey she used to hit on your husband in front of you,
and you kept on seeing it.
Because he loves her from before.
Before me.
Sister in law, he has promised to marry her.
To hell with such a promise.
Maheen,
there is no promise, no statement, 
no dialogue bigger than a wedding.
Understand this.
Its not,
if the wedding is done with your heart, then.
But promises, wedding,
nothing has any place,
just like I have no place in Umar’s life.
Uncle is calling me.
Maheen.
Mama.
What are you doing, aunt?
Mama. 
Leave me. I will not leave her.
Mama…
Tell me, what happened?
Don’t ask me anything, Monis.
You went to Roshni’s home, right?
Tell me what did you talk about there.
You always had a complaint that I wanted to get 
rid of my daughter from my head as a burden.
I still want to see her in her home.
A daughter is not a burden,
the burden is the thinking 
that the society shows us.
Still, tell me, what did they say?
Just let me be quiet.
I had never thought that
I would talk about this to
 my daughter and daughter in law.
You can talk about everything
 with your daughter,
go ahead.
Maheen only two people are 
standing with Umar at this moment,
one is me and the other is you.
I maybe am supporting him because 
whatever he is saying and doing,
because I am responsible for it,
and I also because I am scared
 that he will become a rebel.
But
I don’t know why are you supporting him?
But child,
I feel hesitant in supporting him.
I..I don’t.
I don’t want to mistreat you, Maheen.
Tell me uncle,
what do you want?
What is your decision?
Heart.
My heart says that in every
 decision you will be mistreated,
living with Umar and
not living with Umar too.
So,
I give you the right to decide.
What do you want uncle?
A daughter’s decision easily 
becomes a father’s wish.
Child, I want that you always live with us,
even if not as a daughter in law, 
but as a daughter.
Don’t consider this my selfishness,
that I want your support in old age.
I don’t want to give Zakia 
another shock, Maheen.
So,
so, then,
then we will decide for Umar.
I mean, is me living here your condition?
I am not in a position to put 
conditions in front of my son.
I have hopes from my daughter,
I can talk to her,
so I am not putting a condition, 
I am requesting her.
Uncle, order.
Order me.
I don’t want to tie you down, child.
Look,
if you feel that your life will be wasted,
then you have a right
 to speak up about it.
But don’t make any decision hastily,
 Zakia, already…
Uncle.
Uncle,
I will live here.
I will live here with you,
till you want
You got me here,
when you think its feasible,
you can drop me back.
Just don’t mention this to Umar.
Now if you are satisfied from my side,
then also satisfy Umar.
Live long.
Live happy.
