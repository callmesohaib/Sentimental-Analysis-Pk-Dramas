I have to go there daily, I am helpless.
And when I go there,
I have to get embarrassed daily
and look at her stubbornness.
Brother was asking even today,
won’t Maheen come to see me?
Mama,
why does Roshni go there every second day?
Was she there today too?
I see her daily.
Why does she go there?
I am asking you something.
I don’t know.
You ask her.
She must go because of her,
the tears in her eyes have dried.
I am telling you Monis,
her actions are not those of fixing her home.
But I need an answer to my questions.
Okay. Stop.
What reason?
What relation does she go there with?
Being Maheen’s friend?
But she doesn’t consider them their own.
she doesn’t participate in their pain and sorrow,
but why is Roshni always there in place of Maheen,
I want to know this.
Okay, come on. Stop now.
Come on.
You eat really little,
okay bring it fast man.
I am seeing you so happy
and relaxed after so many days.
Yes,
mama will come home from the hospital.
Thank God.
Papa will be home in a few days too.
Roshni,
you have really supported me in these days.
You were my support.
Thank you.
You know,
your mother spoke with me with so much love,
for the first time.
Really?
Earlier, she considered me Maheen’s friend,
she didn’t give me much importance.
But then she started talking to me so lovingly.
You know I have made your work easy.
What work?
Hey,
now if you talk about me at your home,
then you will not have to convince them a lot,
because they have started to
like me a little from the start.
Yes, but
it won’t be right to talk about
this in the current situation. Right?
Hey, this is the right time.
When you spoke to them earlier
about the second wedding,
that was the wrong time,
this is the right time.
You talk about it again, please.
I am really happy.
Najia.
Hey, coming.
Najia.
Come on.
Careful. Careful. Careful.
Hello mama.
Hello.
Take her. Take her. Take her to the bed.
Careful.
Thank God.
Come mama.
Walk slowly. Slowly.
Hey, I am also not used to this.
No practice.
Hold this.
Hold my hand.
Careful child. Careful.
Give it to me. give it.
Thank God.
Take this Mansoor,
give this to someone.
Yes.
Put a pillow under my leg.
I will keep it.
The big one, keep this.
Keep it.
That’s it. That’s it. No. remove it.
Thank God I am back to my home.
Are you happy now?
You are back home after so many days,
God has given you a new life.
I will be happy the day their father comes home.
May God just give him health soon.
By the will of God, papa will be
with us in two to four days.
By the will of God.
By the will of God. By the will of God.
Hey,
are you people this happy on me coming back
or is there another reason for the happiness?
No, no mama,
we are really happy that you are back,
and…
Hey, when Mansoor tells you,
when he gives you the good news,
you will get real happiness.
Mama,
God has answered your prayers.
Your wish is fulfilled.
Najia is pregnant.
What?
What are you saying?
Oh God, thank you.
How do I thank God?
Hey Najia, come here.
Go.
Congratulations to you child.
What are you doing standing there?
Go get sweets,
I will distribute them to the locality…
in fact, I will distribute it to the whole family.
Go get it.
No. no. no. no.
No need to spread the word,
first child is always hard,
after two or two and a half months pass,
then you can tell everyone, not right now.
Fine mama. Fine.
Mama, this is the fruit of your
and grandma’s prayers,
when we were even disappointed with the doctor,
God showered his blessings suddenly.
Come here. Come here.
Yes.
Hear me out, please.
I don’t want to hear anything.
if you want to talk to me about anything,
send the proposal tonight, that is it.
Come on.
I am coming.
Hey, Monis.
Listen,
the thing is that Maheen is already home.
Now in this situation mama cannot go to her in-laws
where recently they had an accident and tell them
that we are going to fix the date of Monis’ wedding.
But Monis, what does sister Maheen want?
Does she want to live 
at her in-laws house all her life?
If you want I can talk to her.
No Fazeela, you won’t do that.
The thing is that
I don’t Maheen to think even for a moment that
because of her there are issues in our life.
but issues are there.
You know even today aunt is
coming to talk to mama,
what do you want Monis?
Don’t I have a family?
Do I not have to face anyone?
After all, how do I tolerate all this?
Okay, fine, you don’t worry,
I will talk to mama today.
I don’t worry,
I don’t get tensed.
Maheen is my friend,
my wedding is getting postponed because of her,
how can she do this with me?
You please make her understand,
not to do this with me.
We will find out a solution.
Okay,
smile a little we are sitting together.
Just a little bit.
I will talk to mama today.
Drive fast friend.
I have been in the hospital for nine days,
you have been to work and in the hospital only,
you have not rested for a moment.
The rest I am getting from caring for you,
I can never get rest like that ever.
A child like you is a blessing.
Its just that parents make a mistake in
understanding and seeing the child.
I feel embarrassed now that
I used to consider you so careless and someone
who would run away from responsibility.
What are you saying papa?
I am the one who is embarrassed.
I have bothered you people for no reason,
forgive me.
The worry I see on your face,
what is the reason for that?
Its all because of my one sided decisions.
I now realize that
children are not like blank cheques
that you cash them when you want.
God has given me a second life so that
I fix my mistakes.
Look mama, Fazeela is not wrong,
her sister has made
all preparations for the wedding
and her family calls her mother daily
to ask about the wedding date.
Look Monis, 
I am really worried because of Maheen,
how do I tell your paternal family
that I am fixing your wedding date.
They already knew that
I would get married this year,
then what is the issue?
Maheen.
The issue is Maheen
coming home and sitting here
and your aunt and uncle are bed ridden.
Son, try and understand the sensitivity of time.
Hey, no need to do anything lavishly,
we will do it with simplicity.
We have an excuse that
because of aunt and uncle’s health,
the whole plan has gone down the drain.
Wow, you two thought of everything,
you have planned everything,
you just didn’t think of Maheen.
Hey, I will talk to Maheen,
if she doesn’t want to go home,
then she can stay here till my wedding
and create a drama of being Umar’s good wife,
like she was doing earlier.
Damn you,
why would she have to do a drama?
I will convince her.
She is not bad at heart,
she is like your father,
stubborn but she has a realization inside her.
Okay,
fine.
Go tell them
that we will come to get the date this week.
Look Monis,
I am really worried because of Maheen,
how do I tell your paternal family
that I am fixing your wedding date.
They already knew that
I would get married this year,
then what is the issue?
Maheen.
The issue is Maheen coming home and sitting here
and your aunt and uncle are bed ridden.
Son, try and understand the sensitivity of time.
Maheen.
Maheen.
You are not ready?
You won’t go?
Come along Maheen,
Razia has been discharged from the hospital,
the whole family will come to meet her.
If they find out you are not there,
they will talk a lot.
They all know from the beginning,
those who don’t know,
you tell them.
You just come to ask about her health,
I will not leave you there.
When the relation is over, then why do I ask?
Then sit here!
Your eyes no longer have shame,
I don’t know what’s up with you.
God knows what girls tolerate at their in-laws,
look at me,
have I faced less?
And that Najia,
Razia is so strict with her,
but someone like Najia,
at this time even she is receiving praises from
the world caring for the mother and daughter in law.
But you sit,
you don’t go,
but I will have to go,
I will also have to face everyone’s sarcasm,
they will question me how I brought you up.
Why is Zakia coming now?
Monis called.
I thought I would tell you.
Tell Monis,
not to do these dramas,
if they have the girl sitting at their home,
then she should stay at home.
Yes and no need to come and ask how I am.
I cannot say all this to them,
you say it yourself.
Yes, why would you say it?
You are obedient to your mother in law.
My son has been so low.
He doesn’t laugh, nor smile,
if Zakia is not worthy enough
 to take away his worries,
then tell her that there is no need
to get blessings by inquiring about me.
Let her come today,
you will see how I talk to her clearly.
Maheen, you should have gone with them,
you too have relations from that home.
I know aunt
and I know the worth of those relations
and I also respect them in my heart
but right now I know what relation
everyone wants me to save.
So what is wrong in that?
Look, there is still a chance to make truce,
that won’t be there in future.
Learn to respect relations.
Now see my Roshni,
what does she lack?
She is twenty two years old,
but still there are no proposals.
She will get proposals aunt.
Anyway, there was a little hope that
was created with one of our relatives,
you know them,
Shahista and her son.
But she got hurt so badly from there,
that she is still sad.
Sad?
She said no herself, right?
She would have said no,
if they had sent the proposal,
They misbehaved with us a lot
they insulted us so badly.
Look at my Roshni,
she had such dreams and hopes
that is why I say respect relations.
My Roshni even went to their home and
in the end what did they turn out to be?
Meaning they had not sent a proposal?
And you were not pressurizing Roshni to accept it?
She didn’t say no herself?
Oh God,
meaning Roshni told you nothing.
I thought you were close friends,
she would tell you everything before me.
Look Maheen,
don’t mention anything to Roshni,
that I told you everything.
Look she will fight a lot with me,
I will get disrespected badly.
No,
rest assured aunt,
I won’t tell her anything.
You have these snacks.
Leave this.
Look Maheen,
you are saying the truth, right?
You won’t tell her anything, right?
Look Maheen, if you tell Roshni,
she will fight and
stay locked in her room for days,
oh God this is a big problem.
You know, God guide you girls.
Both of you.
One doesn’t get married and the other doesn’t know
how to live in a relation after getting married.
Don’t worry aunt.
Yes.
I am really worried.
Damn it,
you have no shame,
no manners, you came alone.
You cannot control a girl.
Mama, she is not agreeing,
she is being stubborn, what could I do?
I cannot force her.
Look at that,
if Umar had said something like that,
everyone would have beaten him up so much
that he would have straightened up.
You cannot control a girl.
You know I cannot agree
that Maheen did all this,
you must have instigated her.
What are you saying mama?
What mother wouldn’t want her
daughter to stay at her home?
Yes, a mother like you.
Tell me, tell me sister in law,
did Maheen ever talk to you badly
or argue with you?
She always respects everyone.
That is what we are crying about.
we were good to her, she was good to us,
then what got into her head?
If she has a complain with Umar, then tell us.
Whoever is at fault, we will ask,
regardless if its our own son.
But she forgot all manners.
Umar cannot be at fault, I can tell you this.
But mama people are saying
that God knows how Umar
and us have tormented this girl
that she is not agreeing to
come here from her mother’s home.
You know Zakia,
people are pointing fingers at our son,
that God forbid, 
maybe he has the fault.
We got stuck after doing a good deed.
My son seems so low these days,
from the hospital to home 
and from home to the hospital,
he didn’t get any peace getting married.
Is this how wives are?
Wives support the husband
 in happiness and sorrow.
He married on his parents’ will 
and this is what he got in return.
Live long, stay happy.
Mama just gave me the good news,
may God bring that time safely, 
may you have happiness in your lap.
Thank you aunt.
The doctor asked her to rest,
but she doesn’t have rest in her fate.
She is doing her work and mine too.
The one who is supposed to care for this home, 
we don’t know about her.
Mama, stop it, 
the doctor has told you not to,
why are you getting worried.
May God not make anyone handicapped, 
may he not make them bed ridden.
Oh God, how are you handicapped,
may God protect you, pray for good.
Mama, being handicapped is the same,
whether its for a year, or for a few months.
I cannot get off the bed,
I am dependent on Najia 
to go to the bathroom even
and is she in the condition 
to take care of all this?
After so many prayers, after so long,
God showed us this day.
If God forbid, something goes wrong, 
who will be responsible then?
Stop it now. Stop.
Don’t worry.
You shouldn’t have got aunt here in this condition.
She has to hear so much,
although I know well that 
aunt has no fault in this.
Then whose fault is it Umar?
At least you tell me 
the reason for all this issue,
Maheen won’t tell us anything apart from the fact 
that she doesn’t want to live with you.
So is this reason not enough?
What do you want?
Monis,
I cannot force anyone to stay with me.
when she cannot tolerate my existence,
she hates me so much,
then how can I myself…
Okay I will leave then.
Hello.
Hello aunt.
If you had to come, 
you could have come with us.
You were leaving 
and I had to do my packing.
Hello grandma.
How are you now, aunt?
You are going?
Yes, but if you want, I can stay…
No, no.
let me keep my things.
I will leave then, it will get really late.
Its good that you came back to your home, Maheen.
Do we make diet food for aunt?
You leave it, I will make it.
You just came, I will make it.
You were just saying this is my own home
 and then what is the formality?
I will make it, you rest.
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.
Mama and papa’s health,
aunt or family pressure is what brought you back
 or you came with your heart.
There can be a third reason as well.
What is that?
I have come back,
that’s enough.
If you have come back forever, 
and we are satisfied, then that is enough.
Did someone come between you and Umar?
Yes Najia.
Mansoor, Maheen is back.
What?
Maheen is back?
Did she come herself?
Yes,
you do one thing, 
give this good news to papa in the hospital.
No, I am telling anyone anything,
You tell me, where is Umar?
How is he?
I don’t know,
he must be hiding somewhere,
 after all she came herself.
You do one thing, call Umar 
and ask him where he is.
Okay, okay, 
I will come home and talk.
Listen Najia, 
I am trying to make you understand,
that you don’t need to say anything to Maheen.
I don’t know what is going on each of their heads,
we will get stuck in between those two.
Hey, why would I talk?
I don’t have this habit.
But there is one thing,
Maheen should get some credit,
she is really smart,
she went herself, she came back herself,
and she is roaming around in
 the home like nothing happened.
Hey, you women can do anything,
 at any time.
I have not doubted 
the intelligence of you women.
Anyway, I will put the phone down,
 I will come home and talk.
Okay.
I know you don’t like tasteless food,
and definitely not porridge,
but the doctor has said that 
you will have to have diet food for a few days.
Its gotten cold.
My hands are fine,
I can eat myself.
Do you have no shame?
No apology, no embarrassment,
you are going around like nothing happened.
I am embarrassed grandma,
I am not apologizing because 
I know you will forgive me when you want.
Why make place in someone’s
 heart by asking them.
Please do eat this too.
Sore oranges with hot porridge,
my jaw will fall off.
Are you going to the hospital?
To meet uncle.
Yes.
I made food for him,
I will also come along.
Why?
Because I have to meet uncle,
ask him how he is.
Really?
You know he had given up 
hope of your return.
He asked about you a lot,
so no need to do this favor on him now.
I have to apologize to him too.
That’s what you came here to say?
You know, you didn’t have a
good excuse to leave from here,
you didn’t even tell anyone,
apart from you disliking being with me.
Now have you thought of 
a good excuse to come back?
Or the way you suddenly
 didn’t like being with me,
you like being with me.
I just left, because I feared that 
no one in this home needed me,
but its evident that everyone needs me,
so I came back.
No,
I still don’t need you.
I know and I also know that you have freed me
 from all your rights and duties.
But with regards to everyone else,
 I have some duties,
I have come to live up to those 
and you cannot stop me from that.
You realized this really soon.
I realized it, Umar.
You just need to realize
and that is enough,
even if you realize it later.
Mama, earlier you were worried that 
she has come to stay at her mother’s home,
now that she has left you are sitting here crying.
I am crying thinking what 
she must be going through there.
I have seen Razia and mama’s manners,
they have poison in their 
hearts for me and Maheen.
They will not be at peace 
till they spit out the poison.
My daughter, she is so sensitive already, 
what must she be going through.
Hey, she must have thought
 about something and went.
After all, aunt and uncle were
 angry on her not coming back,
now that she has gone back,
 the anger will go.
It won’t go like that,
till the time they don’t
 destroy her with their taunts,
their anger will not go.
Brother is still not home,
he is still in the hospital.
If he was home he would have made 
the environment of the home worth living in.
What will my daughter do, 
she is all alone with her in-laws?
She is not alone,
Umar is there with her.
Maheen, stop child,
daughters don’t look good apologizing.
Uncle, are you upset with me?
No, not at all.
Umar, see how she is losing it by crying like this.
Get her water.
Uncle, you please come home quickly, please.
Yes, my daughter is home now,
I will come home soon.
Right Umar?
Maheen, don’t worry child,
life is really long, okay?
Everything will be fine.
Show me how you smile.
Well done.
Umar.
Listen, you go to sleep,
this is not the time to walk on the roof,
you have to wake up in the morning
 and go to the hospital and also to work.
I know,
but I cannot sleep here now.
I am going to aunt’s room anyway.
When did I say that 
I cannot sleep here because of you.
It doesn’t matter to me 
whether you go from here or not.
Did you hear me, it doesn’t matter to me.
That is really good,
because aunt needs me right now, 
so I will sleep there for a few days.
Listen.
What?
Nothing Maheen.
Go!
