Maheen,
Maheen.
Your fever is not going down,
no medication is working.
Get up.
Get up.
I feel dizzy sister in law.
yes, must be cause of
the fever or medication.
Come on get up, have breakfast,
then you need to go the parlor.
parlor.
won’t you go to the parlor?
Won’t you be a bride?
Bride?
What?
Last night they left,
did the issue get sorted?
Yes all is sorted, in fact it’s great.
Is mama getting them a car?
Has she put the home on the line?
Sister in law, say no. Say no to them.
To hell with those people.
Their useless wishes.
The reason  you got fever,
that is fine.
Get up and get ready,
then see the surprise God has for you.
If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise.
You can see for yourself.
Come on get up.
I have given you a glimpse of happiness
and your fever has gone down.
Once you get complete happiness, you will fly.
Come on, get up and get ready.
Should I get you breakfast?
If it’s a matter of Mahi’s life,
it’s a matter of my life too.
Marrying her if a lot of
people are getting happiness,
me and Roshni are getting sad.
And then I can face this sorrow,
how do I shock Roshni?
Mahi, where is Mahi,
I want to talk to her
about something important.
Okay, Mahi is at the parlor to get ready
and whatever important things
you have say them together.
Ok? Go now.
Yes uncle, you are our elder.
It was not possible without consulting you
but the situation was such.
Yes, I know.
Razia..
Yes, she is Murad’s last sign,
an orphan and then someone as
obedient as Umar has made us happy.
Thank God.
Here you go.
what is this?
for you.
Mama, but…
Razia, you have made me happy,
you accepted my decision.
Okay, so in this haste,
I got this sherwani, it’s really good.
wow.
Its fine, right?
Be happy today.
sister in law
I am really worried,
what are you people doing with me?
What if you take a wrong
decision for me in haste.
You think too much,
whatever is happening is good.
Now prepare her quickly
or we will get calls from home.
Prepare so that the groom
cannot take his eyes off her.
I got your curse Umar,
I don’t know what you went
through when Maheen told you..
maybe you were in
the same pain I am in,
maybe a little more.
It must be more,
which is why you didn’t
say anything to me.
No complain, no sarcasm,
then how can I say you cursed me.
You sit here calmly,
the groom family must be coming.
I will get you water.
listen,
Call sister in law Najia
She is on the other side.
What do you mean?
She was on the bride’s side,
now she is caring
for the groom’s side.
I will get water.
Fine. Fine.
mama,
what is Fazeela saying
about sister in law, Najia?
Is it her relative? Who is it?
God bless,
you look so pretty.
May God give you a good fate.
My fears are all gone,
I was scared giving a piece
of my heart to strangers,
but my worries are gone.
Umar will ensure you are fine.
Umar?
God give him a long life,
he is a good boy,
he cares for everyone,
loves everyone.
I never even dreamed
I will get such a good son in law.
Then on top of that a father like uncle.
You are not going to your in-laws,
just moving from one home to another.
Najia will be there to care for you,
your sister like sister in law,
then Razia’s temper, she has a good
heart though, she loves you a lot.
On top of that Umar.
mama..
Yes, my love.
Mama,
Umar…
Mama, uncle wants to
come in with the priest.
Yes, let them come in.
Ma…
yes Razia, tell Zakia to prepare
to send her daughter off.
Mama, I didn’t think of that,
the wedding got done,
but where will we make Mahi stay?
Have you seen the
condition of Umar’s room?
what is there to worry about?
She will stay in my
room for 2 nights.
What are you saying?
Will we have the bride
stay in temporary rooms?
what bride? She is your daughter,
don’t be so formal.
She is going to her home.
this is not a formality,
but preparations.
Najia was saying she will take
Mansoor home before we leave, she will fix it all.
Thank God someone
is smart about it.
She cannot do it,
have you seen her room?
Mama, I will.
She will do it,
nothing to worry about.
What happened?
Umar, what happened?
Nothing,
I was suffocated.
I am going to the roof.
Yes, go.
oh, my son got the evil eye.
Brother, I called those
people on your instructions.
I told them everything clearly.
They didn’t say a word.
I told them to send
back the dowry as is,
I have sent Monis,
I hope they send it back as is.
Zakia, that is dependent
on their intentions,
if there is something lacking 
don’t create a scene.
Thank God, He saved our daughter.
Consider it charity for the daughter.
Farid is right.
Najia…
Roshni, it’s good you weren’t here,
you won’t have been able to take it
and it would have been really
difficult for me to face you.
You were right,
I am not capable of doing anything.
I cannot do anything.
Umar,
what are you doing here?
Everyone is waiting for you downstairs,
it’s time to leave.
You know I shouldn’t say this,
but I am a brother.
Look, if
Mahi says something wrong
or does something
you don’t like, forgive her.
Ok?
Thank you. Shall we?
Okay my love,
this is now your mother’s home,
come here as a guest.
It’s time for you to leave.
Mama,
I need to talk to you.
they are waiting for you outside,
you come tomorrow
evening with Umar, we will talk.
Mama, its important.
Go ahead.
Mama,
Umar…
why do you want to
talk to me about Umar?
Do your talking with Umar.
Mama,
he, Roshni…
Why mention Roshni here?
I got scared what the issue is
and you are missing Roshni.
To hell with her.
She didn’t even stay for your wedding
and you are crying for her.
Look Mahi,
leave memories and friendships back.
Razia may be good but her temper is bad,
she forget everything quickly.
She won’t take long to become
a mother in law from her aunt.
Forget this,
I am already under the
burden of their favors.
Now see,
make sure they don’t complain.
Fazeela,
bring the veil to send
the daughter away.
Come on, play the music!
Roshni, stop it,
how much will you cry.
See I was so worried that
you are traveling alone.
Tell me, why did
you leave suddenly?
mama, I told you,
I missed you, this home.
you missed us all of a sudden?
Tell me honestly,
did someone say something?
What can anyone say to me?
I am telling you,
I couldn’t stay there.
fine, don’t tell me,
I will ask Shazia myself.
In fact she called yesterday ,
I was in Maheen’s function so
I couldn’t talk to her about the proposal.
mama, don’t call her and
if she calls don’t talk to her.
But why?
because I told you.
If you stay quiet, they will
know it’s a no from us.
no from us?
Oh God, but you were restless…
I was mad.
When I went there,
stayed for a few days,
I realized those people
are separate from us,
we don’t have match
with them, they are rich.
That’s what I was trying to tell you,
but you didn’t get it.
Even if that boy is good,
he is well educated,
he has lived abroad.
You know in a few days he would
have found so many issues
and Shazia,
she has become a
madam after getting wealth.
What didn’t change
is your mother,
I am plain.
yes mama,
that is why I took out this
thought from my head,
you too stop thinking.
Okay forget it all and rest.
You must be tired,
you are traveling since morning.
I will make you something you like.
Fine.
Umar must be here,
it will be easier to convince him.
He is stupid,
I will just say I did it to bother him
and make him jealous,
he will agree immediately.
Right foot first. Come on.
Mama leave these customs,
come on
God bless.
Where is Umar?
He went out.
He must have gone to meet friends.
Must have gone to tell friends.
Najia..
Mama, Najia is fixing
the bride’s room.
Okay.
Mama, I wanted to take her upstairs,
she must be tired.
When the locality finds out they
will come to congratulate us.
Yes, they can come as
many times as they want
but they won’t see the bride’s
face before reception.
mama, how can I say no?
I am worried about my siblings,
they will get upset.
what is there to get upset about,
we told them we are helpless.
Why won’t they get upset?
They are uncle and aunts,
they were not part of the wedding,
they will surely get upset.
these people will just complain,
take her to the room,
Najia is taking so long.
Take her.
we have the child
standing here for so long.
Careful child. Come
Thank God.
Umar,
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
Papa asked me to look for you,
I asked your friends,
but I knew I would find you here.
I saw your bike here,
come home, everyone is waiting…
I don’t want to go, you go.
umar, what is your problem?
Problem?
You are asking me this right now?
You made a such a big decision
of my life without asking me,
no one asked me my issue then.
No one thought I am a living being,
I have some hopes.
No one does this to girls nowadays.
You forcefully got me tied to the
door like a sacrificial animal.
That too forcefully.
Forcefully?
Now everyone wants me
to act like I am happy.
I should sing and dance like
you people did me a favor.
One minute, Umar. One minute.
I thought you would dance in happiness.
Don’t you like Maheen?
it’s not about liking or disliking anyone.
What is it that she lacks that I don’t like her.
This is not the issue.
In fact,
I have no complains from her,
she has no fault.
When she couldn’t say anything,
how could I?
But can I not complain to you people.
One minute Umar,
I don’t get what you are trying to say.
You love Mahi…
you wanted to marry her?
We all felt this was your wish.
What?
You people thought 
it was my wish?
Yes, what else?
mama.
Mama.
Yes?
You didn’t get ready?
No, and why are you 
so dressed up?
Today is Maheen’s wedding,
don’t you want to go?
Wedding?
That was done,
and she went away too,
just before you came.
the situation was
such that they had to do it early.
The boys family had weird
demands on the Hena night.
mama, I will ask the rest of
the story from sister Zakia.
Listen, I am telling you,
she went away.
Aunt Zakia will be there,
I will hear the rest of the story from her
and also the guests will be there. I am going, bye.
come back soon.
She doesn’t get it.
we thought…
Brother Mansoor, I don’t know
what made you people think this,
what action of mine
made you think this.
okay,
fine I had a misunderstanding,
the wrong estimate I gave papa,
he was satisfied to make the decision.
Mama thought about
you agreeing and gave up.
But Umar, think,
if I didn’t have this misunderstanding
and I had not given papa confidence,
then wouldn’t they make this decision?
They still would have done it
but they did it with a light heart
and no mental pressure.
Then they would have done it out
of helplessness, embarrassed in front of you,
but
they would have done what happened now.
Imagine, if you were asked,
what answer would you have?
You would have said no,
but for how long?
You would in the end had to do this.
now what had to happen, happened.
Why and
how is a useless argument,
it’s best you come home.
Come.
Wish you had come early,
Maheen left a little while
back asking about you.
I thought I would come on the
right time and surprise her,
but I got the surprise.
The wedding was during the night,
how did it get done during the day.
didn’t your mother tell you?
She did, so I am asking you,
also the home feels so sad,
doesn’t look like a wedding home.
the home where the girl
goes from it becomes sad,
so does the heart.
Have all the guests left?
Long time back.
will you eat something?
No, I don’t want to meet anything.
Maheen’s grandma,
she came so before the wedding,
she should have stayed after too.
what will she do living here?
That is the wedding
home now honestly.
I got free from my
responsibility with peace of mind,
they had to make
the arrangements.
Arrangements for what?
Brother took 2 days to the reception
but still, it was sudden for them,
there is an issue.
Should I make you tea?
no, I won’t like it if you make tea.
Yes,
Mahi is not here to care for you,
but don’t worry,
she will visit often.
This is the advantage
of marrying in the family.
I think Umar won’t be the type
who would put restrictions on his wife.
You are Frank with him too.
Umar?
he is no stranger for you,
you can go meet Mahi when you want
not considering it her in laws home,
but her uncle’s.
Everyone was up,
I think they slept early.
You come Umar, come.
except for Maheen.
Najia was saying she is crying continuously.
Look Umar,
the thing these people think,
let them think that.
I am not saying
it cause I will come across as a liar,
I am saying it because
papa and aunt will lose their peace,
they will consider
themselves as culprits.
Brother, I won’t do
anything like that.
in all this Maheen has no fault,
so please don’t torture her.
Coming to a girl’s life in
this way is painful for her.
Saying anything to anyone will
do nothing for me, nothing will change.
I know this.
