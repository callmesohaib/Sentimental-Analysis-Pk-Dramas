He is not yours,
he loves me.
Even after knowing all this you
are still living with him,
being called his wife.
Umar is the one who is going to suffer between us.
He cannot give me pain,
nor can he give you pain.
He is suffering alone.
There are two ways out of this,
either you leave him,
or I leave him.
No one is forcing anyone.
But I love Umar,
I will have to think for him.
Thank God I am not in your place,
so what if I don’t have Umar,
I have his love.
I am proud
that I am giving away my love,
not snatching it from someone.
If I was in your place Maheen,
I would have died
Thinking that I got such a person for all my life
who can never be mine.
You have played a big game Roshni.
If all that you are thinking doesn’t happen.
What if you find out that Umar and Maheen
go for their honeymoon.
No,
this is not possible.
I know Maheen since childhood.
I know the exact points 
that I need to press.
She will do whatever I have thought.
Umar,
Roshni came.
She was saying…
I don’t want to know what she was saying.
Don’t repeat what she said,
it will hurt me.
Whatever she did is for me and you.
Now you be happy.
I will be happy?
I will be happy giving you pain?
Man, leave some corner of the home,
where a man can worry alone.
You can pretend that I am not here,
you carry on with your worries.
I will not interfere in anything.
You go downstairs and be worried.
Papa is downstairs,
I am hiding from him.
Why don’t you go to your room
and get worried?
Najia is there.
And I am hiding from her.
I did something weird in the morning
and now I don’t have the courage to face her.
I too am hiding from papa,
he has a lot of questions for me.
Umar,
how have our parents brought us up?
We hurt someone a little,
And we choose to hide our faces from them.
I don’t know who are those people that break someone’s 
heart and go around like nothing happened.
You are right.
I don’t know how people hurt others
and stay happy.
Did you hurt someone?
I don’t know,
maybe.
You stayed up all night worried.
And you too?
You didn’t ask me about
the reason of my worry.
At least tell me about your worry.
I knew
that you must be up worried about
something related to your children.
I too am a father,
so how can I be worried about anything else.
Did Mansoor tell you anything?
I am worried because of Umar.
Umar?
What happened to Umar?
Maybe he is not happy with this wedding,
with Mahi.
Why do you feel this way?
Did Umar tell you this himself?
He wasn’t clear about it.
but there is definitely something 
going on between them.
No Fareed,
I didn’t feel that way.
Mahi is busy with herself,
no fights, no arguments,
Nothing has been shown between those two.
that’s abnormal.
Then its definitely not normal.
A husband & wife have a thousand complaints.
I feel remorse, Razia.
I made the wrong decision in my haste.
Umar is not happy with this wedding.
Will you drop me at my mother’s place?
No, keep this here.
You please ask Monis, he will take you.
Listen, Maheen,
actually I don’t want to go there.
I don’t want myself in any such situation.
I have promised Roshni
and I don’t want to go against my promise.
I will not try to meet her.
You ask Monis,
he will take you
and he will also drop you back.
I…
I think you slept late last night,
its time to go to the office,
I will make breakfast.
No. No.
I am in no hurry,
take your time in making the breakfast,
I don’t have to go to work today.
We have missed yesterday’s appointment,
I have to go there today.
I don’t want to go.
But I have to go.
You can go if you want to,
but I don’t want to go.
I will go,
and you will come along with me.
Mansoor,
I don’t want any such test done that
put these useless thoughts in your head.
Don’t you trust my love?
Its not about trust, Najia.
You too at times, used to get scared,
get worried and ask me,
that if I would remarry under their pressure.
When you have fear of
losing me in your heart,
then how can I not have
such a fear in my heart?
I cannot leave you.
Did I go against everyone,
against the world and married you for this?
Najia,
this is what we forgot.
Before becoming husband and wife,
we have another relation of heart.
A wedding is a pure relation,
but its not strong,
it breaks, it unbreaks,
but the relations of heart never break,
love never ends, Najia.
After thinking all night,
my heart is now satisfied,
I have thought, I have decided that
we will go to the doctor.
Whatever happens, we will see.
At least once,
we should find out that
if we need to keep hope or not,
or think about something else.
What something else?
That can we live with this or not?
Whether its your lacking or mine.
If there is a lacking in you, I promise you,
I will never leave you alone,
I will not get married again.
We will adopt a child
but if you want it, only then.
But,
if the problem is with me,
then still,
you will make all the decisions yourself.
If you want to accept me or not,
whether we adopt a child or not.
Najia,
I once again with an open
heart saying this to you,
to complete yourself,
if you have to leave me
and marry someone else…
I cannot leave you,
I really love you.
Now if I am lacking or you are,
the two of us have to stay with each other
and that too happily. Ok?
I know, thank you.
I love you for that.
Thank you.
I am making spinach for dinner,
you like it, right?
Yes, but call Umar and ask, if he is coming,
I will ask Monis to get chicken.
Mama, can I ask you something?
Yes, go ahead.
If you find something,
I mean, just like walking on the road,
you find something,
what should you do?
Should you keep it?
What did you find? From where?
Mama, tell me,
if you find something like this,
then isn’t keeping it theft?
No, you found it on God’s ground,
how is it theft?
What is it?
 Is it something made out of gold.
No.
No, I didn’t find it,
someone found it,
they were asking me,
so I didn’t have an answer.
So I thought I would ask you.
Oh.
But mama, that is theft,
keeping something that someone else owns,
making it yours with pride.
No,
when you found it on the way, its yours.
Who knows who owns it,
where it came from, what is theft in this?
Keep it quietly.
But if you know who it belongs to,
in fact,
you know them well, then?
Yes,
if you know then
you should return it immediately,
it is unfair
and if it belongs to someone you know,
there is no point in keeping it.
Why?
You will have to keep it hidden,
you won’t be able to use it in front of the owner,
won’t you be ashamed.
Hmmm…
Child, things don’t matter,
you find them, you lose them,
you need to make relations,
be careful with them,
you shouldn’t fall in anyone’s eyes.
Mama,
if the owner of that thing says that you found it,
you keep it,
then what should we do?
This is the greatness of the owner,
then you should keep it considering it a gift.
Gift or alms?
Charity?
Yeah,
but if the owner needs it more,
but they still give it to you,
out of friendship,
or sympathy or out of empathy,
then its charity, right?
Yes, that is true.
Things given out of sympathy is charity.
Rest God protect us
from charity from anyone,
all your life you need to keep your head down
and favors are separate.
God forgive us.
Your heart may love you,
but you are now Maheen’s.
She is my friend and
I cannot steal her right.
In front of the world your
 and my relation is hollow
and your and Maheen’s relation is strong.
Then why do we live in this hollow relation.
We meet each other once a week like thieves,
we talk to each other,
give each other hopes.
What will we get out of it,
apart from defamation and blames.
I don’t want it.
I don’t want this love out of charity.
I don’t want happiness given as alms.
Who are you talking to?
Huh?
Pizza.
Mama told me that you have not eaten,
so I got you pizza.
No, brother. When I am hungry I will eat.
eat it.
Brother...
here you go.
Aunt has said I have gotten fat .
Have it, have a little.
I will eat. I will.
What is the matter Mahi?
There is something,
now won’t I recognize your mood?
Huh?
You have a long face and
why didn’t Umar come to get you?
He has some work.
Are you telling the truth?
I mean, you have not come here
after fighting with Umar and aunt right?
What am I asking and to whom am I asking.
She cannot fight with anyone,
nor can she argue.
She is really naïve.
But if I fight one day, then?
I am saying it cannot happen.
You cannot get upset and
no one can get upset from you, for long.
what if,
one day I come home like this,
just like that and I say that
I don’t want to go back,
then what will you say?
That, that is your home, live and die there.
Will you drag me out of the home.
So what are you doing?
Okay, first, God forbid that this happens,
but I can tell you, I will not do anything like this.
Ok?
I know my sister will not take a
step like this on something small,
she is really patient
and God forbid something like this happens,
then this would mean
that something is there,
that is out of my sister’s
patience and tolerance.
I will test you just like that?
We have married you,
not cut you from us and thrown you away.
Stupid.
Come on eat.
Listen, take out these weird
thoughts from your head
and don’t think that I have left my brother,
mama and mother’s home far behind.
We are with you even today,
just like pizza. Eat.
Mama is stubborn like a child,
she doesn’t see her illness,
she just wants to fulfill
the flavor of her tongue.
Greetings.
Greetings.
We have got all the tests done
 that you had asked for done.
Then?
By the grace of God,
Mansoor’s reports are normal.
Thank God.
And yours?
My reports were normal earlier too,
they are normal now too.
This means there is a delay from God,
now a man cannot argue with God,
whenever he wants, He will give us.
Greeting.
Greeting.
No,
there is no argument in this,
God has kept a lot of ways open.
If you and Mansoor,
want to wait for two to four years with some hope,
 then that’s different.
But if after two to four  years,
God forbid, out of hopelessness
you have to decide this,
then you make this decision right now.
What decision?
You get Mansoor married again.
Its possible he might get a child out of
someone else’s fate and not mine.
Najia?
Mama, I am not saying
all this out of any pressure.
The love I have for Mansoor,
this is what it demands
that I happily allow him to complete his life.
Love is all about giving
and if he being a man can say this to me,
then why can’t I have
a big heart being a woman?
You get him married.
If this is what love demands,
then I will live up to it.
Love is the name of giving, right?
Roshni was right,
Maheen wanted this with her heart,
it doesn’t matter to her
that to give her happiness,
Roshni has made such a huge sacrifice.
I am going through much torture
and she is happy and satisfied.
Will you iron all the clothes today?
As many possible.
Leave some for the morning aswell
or you want to show off to the entire home
that you are efficient.
Morning…
you sleep.
You seem really happy.
Did you get your hands on some treasure
or did Roshni give you something?
Who knows, who gave whom what?
You are sleepy Umar, you sleep.
I am going to sleep.
What was the need to say this to mama?
I had to say it, so I said it.
We had decided
that we would stay with each other,
whether complete or incomplete.
A lot of people live with us in this home,
apart from us.
You cannot ignore their wishes.
Najia, its not in my hands to fulfill their wishes.
You too don’t have the right to,
or without asking me give
them this permission about me.
Mansoor,
I just gave her permission
so that she doesn’t feel that
I am a hurdle in this route
that wants to stop your life
from being complete.
Now its her decision whether
she does this or not,
or whether you support her
in this decision or not.
I did my work
and maybe with the belief that
me giving permission or
not doesn’t matter,
you won’t agree.
Najia, you put the thought in her head,
now she will pressurize me for no reason.
It was a debt on me.
Mansoor, she is your mother,
whatever she does for you,
you can take it as your right.
But being my mother in law,
she thought something for me,
then it was compulsory
for me to say all this.
What is the point of going to her
mother’s home every day?
And look at her manners,
she is not taking my permission,
she is informing me,
that too while standing,
that I am going to my mother.
I asked why,
she didn’t answer and went inside.
She is newly married,
girls get sad for their mother’s home.
What do you mean the heart gets sad?
Isn’t a month enough.
After all, there is no custom that
allows you go to your mother’s home daily.
I will talk to Umar, he has been lenient.
Leave it Razia,
let her go right now,
talk to her calmly later.
I wish you were as lenient in my matters as you are
in the matters of your sons and daughter in laws.
I was only allowed to go once in a month,
after a lot of requests and pleading.
Okay, I will remove this
complaint of yours today.
Since you start competing with
mama’s behavior on everything,
I am being this lenient for you.
I break this rules for you.
So many years have passed,
you have not forgotten this,
the sorrow of your heart has not left,
that mama was a tough mother in law for you.
You complain about it daily,
mention it ten times during the day.
What do you want Razia?
That your daughters in law
also mention you the same way in future,
like you mention mama?
Umar.
I am going to my mother’s home.
No,
I…
I didn’t come here to ask you to drop me,
I know you don’t like going there,
I will ask Monis to pick me.
You came from there yesterday only,
if you go again, my mother will get upset.
Let her be upset.
Oh, so now my mother being
upset doesn’t matter to you.
All the obedience was temporary?
Everything was temporary,
not strong enough,
I am going to my home forever.
