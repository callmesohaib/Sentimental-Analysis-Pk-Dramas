Umar.
Umar.
What happened?
Papa’s operation is successful,
he is out of danger.
Thank God.
Why are you people lying?
Tell me honestly, how is he now?
Aunt.
He is fine.
He is fine, trust me.
The doctor said he will be fine,
our prayers worked.
Oh God, thank you so much.
But I,
I have become a handicapped
and will be bed ridden.
Hey mama,
why are you thinking like this?
Death is better than such a life of handicap.
Why are you saying these damned things, Razia.
Don’t give me fake hope.
Its better that
God calls me to him instead of living on
someone’s support for the rest of my life.
Aunt, the doctor said you will be fine,
you just need to rest.
Don’t give me fake hope.
Okay, I will do one thing,
I will call the doctor,
he will tell you himself that
nothing happened to you, everything is fine.
The doctor will say whatever you told him.
I know I am not fine.
Okay fine, go, call the doctor.
Sister in law, what happened?
Are you ok?
I don’t know I just felt dizzy.
Sit.
Sit.
I am fine, I will go and call the doctor.
Umar,
man, don’t worry,
uncle will regain consciousness,
ok?
I will go and drop Maheen and mama home,
then I will come back to you.
No, you don’t need to come back, its ok.
What happened sister in law?
Are you ok?
What happened?
Nothing, I just took her to the doctor,
her BP is a little low,
she has not eaten anything since morning.
I am fine.
You take sister in law home,
you go home and rest sister in law,
Grandma is alone at home too.
No, who will stay with mama?
I am here.
No, its important for you to stay with papa.
Najia, Umar is right, we cannot leave
grandma alone at home,
you should stay at home with her,
this way you will get to rest a little too.
No,
mama is really worried,
and I don’t know why she feels
we are hiding something from her.
I cannot leave her alone like this,
someone has to stay
with her in this condition.
I will stay.
I will stay with aunt,
you go home and rest sister in law.
Papa.
Papa.
Please open your eyes,
talk to me.
Forgive me papa.
Forgive me.
I have really bothered you.
I will not do it again.
I promise you,
I will accept anything you say,
I will not go against
any decision you take for me.
Please forgive me.
Just open your eyes,
papa, I am dying to hear your voice.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Umar.
Father.
Thank God papa regained consciousness.
Yes.
You know I am fine now,
if you want to go back to the hospital, you can.
Sure?
Yes, yes.
Its not that I didn’t stay there 
because I was unwell,
I came home because of another reason.
What is that?
Umar and Maheen are alone there,
we should give them some time.
In this time of sorrow,
a person becomes more sensitive
and it’s possible that to take Umar’s sorrow,
she comes near him
and the distances between them reduce.
Yes, you are right.
Then I too should stay here tonight.
I pray to God this happens.
Yeah.
Yes, hello.
Sorry,
I was not able to respond,
I was not in my senses.
I am still at the hospital.
Yes, so?
I was calling you to ask if everything is fine,
I don’t want to chit chat with you.
Yes, man,
 I know this is what is worrying you,
but I am just in a condition 
that I was not in my senses,
so I couldn’t reply to your messages.
Were you not in your senses, 
or Maheen made you lose your senses?
Maheen?
She is there, right?
With you, near you.
There is no one with me or near me,
and I felt that you are with me,
but are you worried about Maheen at this time,
you are asking me this.
I mean…
Hello.
Hello, Umar.
Hello.
Roshni. Roshni. Roshni.
Why does your tongue not stop?
Now was this something to say?
Mama, must have pricked her heart 
 with her taunts and sarcasm.
Razia,
she didn’t even talk properly,
Neither with me nor her.
Fine mama, if she stays there for a few days,
their anger will diminish and 
I think a little has already been removed too.
I pray to God.
My God is witness,
I have nothing against brother 
or Razia in my heart.
Small arguments happen with the in-laws,
but I am not that thankless,
that I forget all of favors brother did to us,
that he did to us after his brother left us.
May God give him a long life.
Amen.
Aunt, have this.
Have this soup quickly,
 then you need to take your medication.
You won’t eat with my hands.
I know you are upset with me,
you are angry,
but aunt,
just for a few days,
forget your anger.
Just for a few days,
then gladly don’t talk to me afterwards.
Because I am now handicapped,
I am at your mercy,
so I forget what you have said about us.
No, God forbid you become handicapped,
but you heard what the doctor said,
you need to rest right now,
you need rest and its essential that
 you take your medication on time,
and for that having food is important,
so you eat right now, 
and don’t talk to me later.
Don’t bother me Maheen,
I see your face,
remember the hope with which your 
uncle came to convince you,
he said he would come back with you.
But see,
what happened to him.
If God forbid,
God forbid, something happened to him,
would you ever be able to forgive yourself?
Are you going to the hospital?
Yes,
is there some work?
This tiffin box, can you take this?
All ok?
How did you suddenly think of making breakfast 
and sending it to the hospital?
I was thinking of going 
to the hospital since night,
I thought I would make something and send it.
Meaning, you too had to go to the hospital?
Why?
Can I not go to the hospital?
Maheen has been here for a week,
 you didn’t come to meet her,
will you go to the hospital to meet her in-laws?
You know, this change is great?
How long will this last for?
Give me an idea.
Going to meet someone who is ill is not a sin and 
what did I say that you are so shocked to hear?
Do one thing either go 
feed your mother this breakfast,
or go inside, my mother is there, feed her this.
But really,
she too will be surprised on this 
action of making breakfast of yours.
Go and check.
Is Monis here?
Yeah.
He went inside to meet papa.
Tell him to take me when he goes.
That’s it?
You met them, its over?
Your duty is complete?
Oh, in fact,
there is no obligation on you,
you just came to live up to
 the expectations of the world.
Okay,
at least I lived up to the world’s expectation,
you couldn’t live up to anything.
Hello.
How is Fareed?
Did he regain consciousness?
Tell me, did you meet him?
You should have apologized, 
he is your elder.
Why are you sitting with your lips sealed, 
why don’t you answer me?
How is he?
Mama, you are going,
you see how he is.
So you didn’t meet him.
What is wrong with you, Maheen?
You were never this rude and ill-mannered, 
after all he is your uncle.
I am not rude or ill mannered,
I am embarrassed.
How do I go meet him?
I felt embarrassed.
Umar,
I know you must not have ate or 
drank anything since last night,
so I made sandwiches and
 tea for you from home and go them.
Thank you.
Sit.
Thank you.
Umar,
I am really sorry.
I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that at night,
your parents are suffering so much, 
and you are in so much difficulty,
and I am…
I am really bad.
Don’t say that Roshni.
You have no idea, 
you coming here has made me stronger.
Having you here with me,
I am really happy.
I don’t see Maheen.
She has left.
She left?
I felt she must have given up her stubbornness.
Talking to papa, seeing his face,
she didn’t even bother going near him.
He loves her so much,
not from today, but since forever.
Not as a daughter in law but as a daughter.
Why did all this happen?
Mama and papa were going to convince her.
Yeah,
leave it Umar,
some people are like that,
who don’t care for love,
nor can they keep someone’s regard.
You are right.
Anyway,
thank you.
I think you should go inside and sit with mama,
if someone sees us alone like this,
I mean you understand, right?
I will go,
let me look at you properly.
Its so weird Umar,
that the one who has a right on you,
she doesn’t like spending time with you and me,
the one who dies to spend two moments with you,
you fear the world might see us.
Anyway,
you take care,
I am with you.
Forgive me Monis,
I didn’t know the matter was so serious.
Did I say something to you?
You didn’t say anything, 
that is why I am worried.
I wish you had said something to me.
Monis, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
Monis, I came running just now too
but when I came here I found out that
aunt has left
and you have no idea how worried I am.
I don’t how for how long
 will our wedding be delayed,
how will I see all this,
how will I do it all.
You know sister coming over will be an issue too.
You don’t understand what I am saying, 
how do I explain it to you?
You are worried about your wedding,
here my sister’s married 
life is having problems.
I am seriously scared by the name of wedding.
A new problem has started.
What?
What did you say?
I said how long will you be afraid?
We have to get married
and one day we will get married.
I come to your home just like that,
my mother has to answer for that.
The neighbors have eyes
and yes,
if you want to change your 
mind about marrying me,
then tell me beforehand,
because my uncle doesn’t have 
a son who will be my support.
Bye.
Hey mother, it is about the being
 on good terms with the locality
and then we care about relations too
and after all Maheen is not my Roshni’s friend,
 she is like a sister to her,
so how is it possible that
 I don’t come to meet his mother and father in law.
The one who has a relation doesn’t realize this.
No its not that Razia,
Maheen has not stopped crying since yesterday.
Since she heard the news, 
you have no idea what  condition she is in.
Aunty, eat something, 
you will regain health sooner.
No child.
Sister, Zakia is absolutely right,
I have always heard
Maheen praise you people.
She is a loving and caring child.
Aunty, should I fix your hair?
Thank you child.
Sister, Maheen is a child,
she is naïve,
but trust me, she is good at heart.
In fact, my Roshni is short tempered,
at times she argues with me,
she fights with the people in the locality too,
but I swear I have never heard 
Maheen talk in a loud voice.
I often give Roshni, Maheen’s example, 
to learn something from her.
Mama, the rickshaw is here, 
shall we go?
Or else we will get late.
Okay we will leave now.
Take care.
Thank you so much.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye aunty.
No, that’s it.
Maheen is so good,
that I swear that she won’t complain 
and I give Roshni, examples of Maheen.
You really love talking negative about me.
you just need an opportunity,
you highlight my shortcomings in front of everyone.
What is wrong with you?
You are making noise since you came, 
what are you shouting about?
what negativity did I highlight about you,
I was just cleaning Maheen’s
mother in law’s heart from her.
Yeah,
are you her lawyer?
Or are you her mother?
Her mother was sitting there, 
she could have said all this herself.
Mama, you went there to ask how she was,
you should have done that and returned.
What was the need to praise Maheen?
Have you gone mad?
You are being upset on useless things.
Now I will ask you before I talk?
Hey, what I thought was right, I said it.
You are here to give me suggestion.
You do your work,
 focus on your work, you talk a lot.
I am not doing it.
I knew it,
these are all excuses to not work.
You have become lazy,
you didn’t have to work 
so you will get upset on these things.
If this is how you will be, 
you will never get married.
See Maheen,
poor thing, she is so naïve,
she too sitting at her mother’s home.
And you?
Someone as short tempered as you,
who will be able to live with you?
You only know this.
My feet are swollen sitting down.
I have sat for four hours,
but Razia didn’t talk to me properly.
Thank God mama was not there
or else she would have insulted me so much.
Maheen,
since you have been born,
you have never hurt me a little,
I have always had comfort from you.
This is the first time, 
I have been so embarrassed because of you.
So many people came while I was there,
they all saw that Razia was not talking to me.
I got so embarrassed.
Mama, you shouldn’t have gone.
How could I not go?
They are not just my in-laws,
 They are my daughter’s in-laws too.
Forget that its my in-laws.
Stop this nonsense Maheen.
Do I even forget that
 its your father’s brother’s home?
Should I forget blood relations?
If not the world,
should I forget fearing God too?
Razia spoke more to Roshni and her mother,
as compared to me, 
although they went there cause of you.
Roshni?
Yes, both mother and 
daughter came in a rickshaw, to find out.
But there is something in today’s time,
who lives up to the relation of neighbors?
I have to go there daily, I am helpless.
And when I go there, 
I have to get embarrassed daily
and look at her stubbornness.
Brother was asking even today, 
won’t Maheen come to see me?
Mama,
why does Roshni go there every second day?
Was she there today too?
I see her daily.
Why does she go there?
I am asking you something.
I don’t know.
You ask her.
She must go because of her,
the tears in her eyes have dried.
I am telling you Monis, 
her actions are not those of fixing her home.
But I need an answer to my questions.
Okay. Stop.
What reason?
What relation does she go there with?
Being Maheen’s friend?
But she doesn’t consider them their own.
she doesn’t participate in their pain and sorrow,
but why is Roshni always there in place of Maheen,
I want to know this.
Okay, come on. Stop now. Come on.
Najia.
Hey, coming.
Najia.
Come on.
Careful. Careful. Careful.
Hello mama.
Hello.
Take her. Take her. Take her to the bed.
Careful.
Thank God.
Come mama.
Walk slowly. Slowly.
Hey, I am also not used to this.
No practice.
Hold this.
Hold my hand.
Careful child. Careful.
Give it to me. give it.
Thank God.
Take this Mansoor,
give this to someone.
Yes.
Put a pillow under my leg.
I will keep it.
The big one, keep this.
Keep it.
That’s it. That’s it. No. remove it.
Thank God I am back to my home.
Are you happy now?
You are back home after so many days,
God has given you a new life.
I will be happy the day their father comes home.
May God just give him health soon.
By the will of God, papa will be 
with us in two to four days.
By the will of God.
By the will of God. By the will of God.
Hey,
are you people this happy on me coming back
 or is there another reason for the happiness?
No, no mama,
we are really happy that you are back,
and…
Hey, when Mansoor tells you,
when he gives you the good news, 
you will get real happiness.
Mama,
God has answered your prayers.
Your wish is fulfilled.
Najia is pregnant.
What?
What are you saying?
Oh God, thank you.
How do I thank God?
Hey Najia, come here.
Go.
Congratulations to you child.
What are you doing standing there?
Go get sweets, 
I will distribute them to the locality…
in fact, I will distribute it to the whole family.
Go get it.
No. no. no. no.
No need to spread the word,
first child is always hard, 
after two or two and a half months pass,
then you can tell everyone, not right now.
Fine mama. Fine.
Mama, this is the fruit of your 
and grandma’s prayers,
when we were even disappointed with the doctor,
God showered his blessings suddenly.
Come here. Come here.
Yes.
You eat really little, okay bring it fast man.
I am seeing you so happy 
and relaxed after so many days.
Yes,
mama will come home from the hospital.
Thank God.
Papa will be home in a few days too.
Roshni,
you have really supported me in these days.
You were my support.
Thank you.
You know,
your mother spoke with me with so much love,
for the first time.
Really?
Earlier, she considered me Maheen’s friend, 
she didn’t give me much importance.
But then she started talking to me so lovingly.
You know I have made your work easy.
What work?
Hey,
now if you talk about me at your home,
then you will not have to convince them a lot,
because they have started to
 like me a little from the start.
Yes, but
it won’t be right to talk about 
this in the current situation. Right?
Hey, this is the right time.
When you spoke to them earlier 
about the second wedding,
that was the wrong time,
this is the right time.
You talk about it again, please.
I am really happy.
