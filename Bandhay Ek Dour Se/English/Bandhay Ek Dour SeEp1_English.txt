Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Cut It with me.
Its your birthday, how can I cut it?
I cannot cut it without you.
Happy birthday to you.
Hummm,
Here, first you.
No, you first.
You first.
No…
Thank you
for giving me these moments.
I will always have this in the
treasure of my memories,
because I only have memories.
I don’t have you,
nor you will ever be.
Please Roshni, don’t say that.
I am still yours like I was before.
I love you Roshni.
When I see you,
I forget everything.
A little more.
Errr…
You will have to eat a little more.
I feel…
I made it myself?
Yeah.
No, I didn’t make it myself.
Hey, you are only feeding me.
There you go, he cut the call again.
Again?
It would have been better had I not called.
Give your beloved some shame.
He can’t even tolerate someone
coming between him and his wife.
Even if it’s the grandma or mother.
Shameless, idiots.
Him and Mahi too.
They got the grandma get
insulted in front of Razia.
Its all Zakia’s doing.
The way she is, what she did,
she has taught the same to her daughter.
Mahi, you? Mama didn’t tell me.
Humm,
I told her not to,
I wanted to surprise you.
Did Umar come or did
he drop you off and leave?
He is here too.
That’s surprising,
it’s a great surprise.
Had you told me, I wouldn’t have gone
to watch a movie with my friends,
I would have taken
Umar along. Umar.
He…
he didn’t feel sleepy,
so he is upstairs on the roof.
I will go get him.
No, its late,
you go, he will sit there all night long,
I will call him.
You sleep, I need to chat with him.
Umar. Umar.
Umar, brother is here, come down.
Yes,
where were you man?
I went to watch a movie.
Where were you hiding?
I was on the roof,
I was walking around.
Why were you calling?
You could have come to the roof.
Come on.
Lets go.
Mahi, get us tea.
Come, lets get fresh.
Listen, Mahi,
tell mama I will come home 
early in the evening.
Wont you come inside?
No, papa is calling again and again, 
I will have to reach soon.
Say hello to grandma.
Listen,
thank you.
Why didn’t you wish me on my birthday?
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Hello aunt.
Hello.
Umar was saying he is going to work,
he will come in the evening.
What are you cooking? 
Should I help you?
Its Umar’s birthday,
I make food for him 
every time for his birthday.
But today I will have 
to call and ask him.
We might have to make rice for him.
Why aunt.
The day he has food from outside, 
he gets unwell.
You people don’t have 
a decent hotel in your locality.
God knows what you fed him.
He cannot digest food from outside.
Aunt,
mama made food at home.
I am considering myself really lucky that
I am the one who congratulated 
you on your special day first.
Me and my little happiness.
Roshni.
Roshni,
I have a new news for you,
you know I just heard that 
Shahista fixed her son’s wedding.
She must have,
they can go to hell. I don’t care.
Well they wont get married secretly,
when she calls me and invites, 
I will ask her then.
Mama,
no need to go to their wedding,
if she calls you, just say no.
Why?
Are we thieves that we hide our face,
or do we have a family feud?
Shahista has treated you and me so badly,
if she didn’t want to get her son married to you, 
she shouldn’t have given me hopes.
At least let me ask them.
Mama,
I said no to their proposal,
I said it to their face.
Why do you want to lower 
yourself saying this to them?
I don’t want to have any 
relation with them after today.
Roshni,
see you don’t tell me the truth.
Tell me, why did you say no to the proposal.
You were so restless to go there,
if you don’t tell me honestly, 
how would I know?
mama,
what would you do knowing?
]You will only be hurt too.
For you, knowing this is important that 
I will never be in loss,
I can think what is best for me,
don’t worry for me so much.
If I don’t worry for you, 
then who do I worry for?
Wow, I really appreciate you,
you got your grandma really 
respected in front of Razia.
I had told you,
I had tried to tell you to 
be careful because I got you here.
Razia will have eyes on every action of yours,
and she will be sarcastic to me when possible.
But did you care about that? No.
Sorry grandma.
Leave it. Sorry grandma.
What good is this sorry?
You are sitting there with 
an innocent face.
You listened to your 
mother and got me insulted.
All this has been taught by Zakia, right?
No grandma
I know it all, I know it all.
Your mother has kept 
my son away from me.
She knows how to control her husband,
and she is teaching 
you the same,
but listen to me Mahi,
she kept my son away from his family,
so he passed away 
or else it was not his age to go.
His heart got weak,
staying away from your own, 
a person is not happy.
Look Mahi,
no one stops you from 
going to your mother’s,
going out and enjoying with your husband, 
no one stops you from it.
But there is one 
day that is not just for you,
but for everyone.
Now on his birthday, 
everyone wanted to be together.
This Razia loves creating a scene,
she is in the room and she instigated me,
I am upset with you now.
Go, make me a good cup of tea. 
Go my child, go.
Huh?
Humm,
This is really light,
this is good,
its dinner at uncle’s home day after,
wear this.
He gets upset when 
you wear something light.
You know after marriage…
I will wear this.
This?
Why don’t you wear a sari?
Sari?
I don’t like saris.
But Umar likes it.
Sister in law, there is no function, 
we are cutting the cake at home,
I will wear this.
Fine, wear this.
Tell me something,
what did you gift Umar?
Gift?
Yeah,
I agree, we have a right on the gift,
but at times when it’s a birthday or anniversary 
and you gift someone, they like it.
He got happy.
Really? What did you give?
Exactly what he wanted.
What?
Same thing that got him happiness.
Fine, you don’t want to tell me.
When we become friends, you will tell me.
Can I ask you something?
Did you mind what mama said? 
She must have insulted you.
No.
Mahi, mama is good at heart,
if she says something, just ignore it, 
don’t take it to heart.
You know these days of the start of the 
marriage are really good, enjoy these.
Okay.
Should I keep this or will you keep it?
I will keep it.
Okay.
Thank you sister in law.
Roshni, that color suited you,
in fact, I feel all colors 
have been made for you.
I wish you were made for me too.
Roshni,
how do I make you believe it.
I came to the roof, 
cause you asked me to.
The whole family got upset.
Family or just Maheen?
Why would Maheen get upset?
In fact, she knows it all,
without her help we cannot meet.
She has no objection on us meeting, 
would she not have an objection if we become one?
What do you mean? I don’t get it.
Don’t be naïve Umar, I said it clearly.
How long will this go on for?
Will she always help us to meet us on the roof,
and show off the favor or will she really 
do something to make us one.
Maheen,
if you were in my place, 
what would you do?
I am in a weird problem.
I don’t have peace for a moment, 
not for a single moment,
I am always restless, weird feeling of 
being on two routes at the same time.
I think am I cheating you?
But then I also think that
I didn’t make any promises to you,
I didn’t show off fake love,
that I have cheated you.
If I did this and still met Roshni,
it would have been cheating, 
but its not like that right now.
Maheen,
say something.
Sit.
Tell me.
What?
That which I am asking you.
You blamed yourself,
then you gave justification 
and made it all fine.
What can I say?
How do I get out of this trouble?
What trouble?
Man,
I consider myself a sinner at both places,
in front of you and in front of Roshni too.
That poor thing trusted my 
fake promises and is now alone.
The relation I am in with you, 
I cannot live up to it either.
I cannot fulfill the rights of either of you.
Don’t consider yourself a sinner for me,
you just said we don’t have such a relation,
nor did you make any promises,
and we never had such a relation that
I would blame you for being unfaithful,
so you don’t have to 
responsible for being faithful.
but I have Roshni’s responsibility on me.
She trusted my promises and waited.
I want her to leave me, and move on, 
spend her life with someone else
but she really loves me.
She is willing to accept me in all cases, 
even with my helplessness.
I have broken her heart once,
if I break the poor things heart again,
she will die and I wont let that happen.
Why are you telling me all this?
You are my friend,
can I not talk to you?
Should I hide it?
I am saying it to lighten 
the burden on my heart.
Has the burden gone down?
Now listen,
I don’t have an issue with 
your and Roshni’s relation,
you people want to meet?
I am not against it,
I don’t say anything,
but what more do you expect from me, 
I don’t get it.
I am not in the middle, 
it was different earlier,
now,
now I cannot help you two meet.
After what happened last night, 
everyone is upset with me,
I cannot do it.
this is weird Maheen, you are worried 
about your image, how are you behaving?
What about what me and 
Roshni went through cause of you,
don’t you see that?
Because of me?
Because of me?
I found out at the time of 
wedding what was happening,
I didn’t have the right to stop them,
you had it Umar,
you should have stopped them.
If I am responsible in all of this,
then isn’t my punishment 
enough that I give up my rights.
That’s enough.
But fighting for you and Roshni,
that is something I cannot do.
Sorry.
You asked the question at the wrong place.
What do you mean?
Why would she want that we become one,
she is your wife.
I have told you so many times,
Roshni, she is the same 
Maheen that she was before wedding,
I am the same Umar, 
that I was before marriage.
She has nothing for me in her heart.
I am not talking about the heart,
nor am I saying she loves you.
Its not about love here, its about her right.
Why would she give her up right? 
Why would she move out
when she sees nothing in front of her.
She got married for the first time with difficulty,
how will she get married again?
She is right,
she thinks about her life, 
she should think about us?
Where are you going?
I am going.
Where?
Because you cannot do anything,
and who did you ask for help?
Someone there is no hope from.
I will live my life with 
your memories Umar.
I cannot forget you, Roshni,
but I don’t want you to ruin your life cause of me.
If I never imagine you being with someone else,
its like death for me,
but still you can choose anyone else,
its up to you.
I have loved you, Umar,
and someone will have to live up to it.
If you couldn’t live up to it, fine,
I will do it.
If spending life without you is difficult,
I will make it easy too,
I will die.
Have you gone mad? 
Where are you going?
Roshni, wait. Roshni, 
where are you going?
You wont do anything like this, are you mad?
You don’t do anything and 
don’t let me do anything, what do you want?
Roshni, for God’s sake, 
try and understand.
I will fix it all slowly, 
I promise you,
you give me some time.
I promise, I will fix it all.
Sit here.
Please don’t say anything like this again.
Aunt, I will make the kebabs.
No, your uncle doesn’t like 
anyone else made kebabs.
Fine, you tell me how do it, 
I will make them like you.
Fine, you make the kababs, 
tell me something else to do.
No, I do it daily, I will do it.
Yes, but I am here,
with me here, how can you be busy.
Will you have tea? Should I make it?
Yes, I will definitely have it with you, 
but you sit.
Hey, I don’t want to 
sit on the throne like mama.
I can make tea.
Hello.
How much sugar.
What is going on?
Fine.
You know since you have come Maheen,
we get to smell great food from the kitchen.
Yes, earlier we didn’t cook anything.
You take everything I say wrong, 
Maheen, can I get a cup of oil.
Wait Maheen,
you have made this a regular practice.
How does your monthly grocery end like this,
keep things in track.
You are really smart about other things,
fashion, going out, your job,
you still don’t know how much expense you 
will have in a month and what groceries you need.
You will stay stupid this way.
Oh God, so much bitterness,
I am your son’s wife,
will you insult me so much for a cup of oil.
Care a little.
Okay fine, once your son comes from the office,
I will send him to get oil and then I will return 
2 cups back to you, happy now? tired,
Wow, you are really 
showing a lot of heart today.
You are talking about returning.
You think my son takes money off the tree,
and you are spending it like anything 
and in the end you get a cup to my door.
You know, you never 
accepted me with your heart,
I wish you had told this to your son too, 
I would have been out of this hell.
Be quiet.
He was in love,
I would never have made 
you my daughter in law.
Aunt, you please stop.
Let her speak,
her day doesn’t pass till she insults me,
can I say something?
You know I didn’t have the luck or the rights,
or I would never make someone 
like you my mother in law.
Give it back, I don’t want it.
See, did you see it yourself,
this girl is so ill-mannered and shameless.
Your mother used to think that 
I am a bad mother in law,
someone ask me how this 
ill-mannered girl tries to rule us.
Aunt, fix your mood, 
I fixed it with difficulty, lets have tea.
Fine, we will have it, 
I will make it.
Pour the oil and give it to her,
she will send my son 
when he comes tired.
You call me so far to meet, 
can we not meet near home?
Is there a spot near home,
tell me.
You will be scared that 
someone will see us.
Are you afraid of people or your in-laws,
that if someone from there sees you.
I am not afraid of them,
I will just have to get beaten by papa.
You will have to get beaten one day,
be a little strong, take a step.
Or else I will die and 
I will make your life easy.
Same thing again,
I told you to give me some time.
Please,
all will be fine, give me some time.
What do I do Umar?
I cannot live without you 
and meeting you is a pain.
I lied at home that 
I am going to meet Maheen.
How is she?
Fine.
Happy?
how would I know?
She will be happy,
the prayers I made didn’t get answered,
she got what I deserved in an instance.
I am what you deserve,
and I am yours, not hers.
haha,
mama look at Umar, 
he looks like a unique groom.
Yeah, look at his face, 
he is so lost.
All this happened all of a sudden, 
but the reception…
Mama, look at this picture of your son 
with Afzal uncle, he looks so happy.
Yeah
Although he created a scene
at aunt Ruqaiya’s home.
Fareed is really stupid.
Not a single picture of the bride and 
groom is worth enlarging,
I paid the photographer for no reason, 
I could have taken pictures from my phone.
Yeah, true.
I will ask Umar to go to 
a studio and get a photo shoot done.
Yes, than that picture, 
I will place here. Right here.
I will put it up here.
It wont be that big, 
you wanted to cover the window.
Yes, only this portion.
Roshni was asking about you.
In fact, when she asked, I realized
I never asked you.
What?
That,
are you happy or not?
I am happy.
Why wont I be happy?
Now she will ask you,
why am I happy?
Tell her that because
you don’t consider me 
responsible for all this.
Maheen, the three of us 
are suffering for no reason.
How long will we suffer?
I don’t know when this 
punishment will end.
You know, Roshni is 
less helpless as compared to us,
she can free herself 
from this hell and punishment,
if you set her free from yourself.
Mahi, I cannot do this at any cost.
Umar, don’t take me wrong,
I don’t have an issue with Roshni’s existence. 
Umar, I know she is hurt,
but if
she forgets all this and starts a new life,
then the burden on your heart will reduce
and new doors will open for her.
She wants to sit on the 
same door and wait for me.
If I cannot make her mine,
then I cannot even force 
her to give up loving me.
She hopes that our 
love will have results,
she feels that the two 
of us will become one, someday.
