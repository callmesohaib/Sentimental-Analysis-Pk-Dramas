I was worried for my daughter.
Our Maheen is good,
so God gave her a good fate.
he really likes Mahi.
Razia send me to sending her
Umar couldn’t see her sad,
he said he would bring her.
tell Roshni to come meet her friend.
Yes, she will surely come.
He doesn’t consider me his mother in law,
he thinks of me as his mother.
This proves how much he loves Mahi.
God protect them from the evil eye
Ameen.
have tea, it’s getting cold
You two are imbeciles,
Maheen my friend,
you saw the coast is clear,
you got on to him.
And poor Umar,
I thought he would commit suicide.
But he was just waiting that
I step back and he takes the step.
Maheen, you are a great girl,
I know as much as I know myself.
I know you didn’t come between me
and Roshni on purpose.
You have no fault,
you were as helpless as me.
In fact more.
I have no complaints from you,
but what do I do of
Roshni’s complaints,
her sadness, her tears,
they will increase the burden on me.
The thing is aunt
Shahista selected me for Nabeel,
that is why they are calling me
so that I can see how they live.
Umar.
Umar.
Umar, I think you
should meet Roshni.
I should?
yes.
Maybe the burden on your heart
will reduce and not increase.
I should have told you earlier,
but it’s best
Roshni tells you herself.
You go meet her.
You want ice cream?
Why are you saying no to ice cream?
Are you feeling ok?
Its not necessary that what we like for us is good
for us because the weather is changing,
if I have something cold,
I will get a sore throat immediately.
Let’s have coffee.
You are avoiding meeting her,
right?
Hello.
Yes, Roshni, is all ok?
You left suddenly.
You still want to know the reason?
you left suddenly,
it’s my duty to ask you the reason.
Did you mind anything?
You mother and son
don’t act so innocent,
what did you think before making the offer?
Are we that low?
You could have said no.
No one forced you.
Mama said nothing wrong.
This too is a house job,
no work makes you small.
don’t give me a lecture on work,
go give this lecture to your mother,
who goes around with your mother.
Lecture your queen, tell her to handle the home,
the servants because it’s not bad to work.
What is your problem?
problem?
I will tell you what the problem is.
Don’t dare calling me and you and your mother if you call here
and say anything about that day.
You don’t know my mother, she will ruin you.
Cut the phone now.
Idiot.
He has ruined me,
ruined everything.
I have no where to go,
die Nabeel.
Because of you I showed off in front of Maheen
and Maheen
would have told all
this to Umar with addition.
umar.
yeah?
Mama is saying so much,
you should stay.
No,
I will go.
I can call uncle and talk.
Meet Roshni too.
You want to add salt to my wounds?
No,
I am trying to reduce your pain.
Honestly Maheen,
I cannot see tears in her eyes.
Maybe she wont cry.
I cannot bear being labeled unfaithful.
What if you are not unfaithful.
okay, I will come.
Have more.
No, I am fine.
did you see,
this is what annoys me about Zakia.
She already controlled Umar,
now he is her son in law,
she has him more in her control.
what is wrong?
If he waits for a night it wont matter.
It’s not just his in laws
but his uncle’s home too.
Now its just his in-laws
and Umar should treat them like in laws.
okay,
how do son's in law treat their in laws?
have you forgotten your time?
You used to come for a few moments,
and sit there doing nothing.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey,
what happened to mama?
Did Najia come?
Your mother doesn’t need
Najia to get upset,
she has another daughter in law.
I had told Umar not to do
anything that annoys Razia but no,
he is married now and
he stayed there at night.
She is upset about that.
Wow,
he stayed there at night,
till yesterday he had issues.
You tell me.
Yes papa, all fine.
I can see that.
please come Roshni,
for the last time.
Insult me as much as you like,
I want to apologize you,
maybe my feeling of crime will go down.
Mahi,
why are you sitting here?
Go sleep.
I am used to my home.
Really?
You have been living here for ages,
but it’s good you made it your home.
Okay go, sleep nos.
I am lying down here,
I will sleep later.
why are you calling now?
To announce his victory or to insult me that
he didn’t take a day to marry Maheen when he left me.
I will never go get insulted.
in fact, I will go.
What will he do? Insult me?
I will insult him too.
What do they think of themselves?
why did you call me here?
what are you looking at?
Speak up.
Blame me. Insult me.
But Umar you are not innocent either.
The haste you showed,
it shows you were waiting for the right moment.
I don’t know since
when you wanted to get rid of me.
You got a chance and bounced onto it.
Speak up.
Why don’t you say something?
Roshni, you speak,
I will hear you.
I came to hear you today.
You speak,
I am unable to say anything.
Say what you want,
I am your criminal.
Criminal?
Yes Roshni,
I committed a big crime.
I made so many promises
and stepped back.
Your faithfulness,
your wait, your love,
I didn’t care for anything.
I don’t want to repeat
anything cause anything
I say will not reduce
your sorrow but increase it,
but if possible forgive me.
You may hate me all your life,
but see my hands and
if makes you feel better,
I will stand like this
in front of you all my life.
Please forgive me.
Umar.
Did Roshni say something?
Please Maheen don’t console me.
I don’t want consolation.
Just stay quiet like Roshni.
I am your sinner,
I made so many promises
I stepped back.
I didn’t care for your love,
faithfulness.
Umar still thinks about me after separating,
this is good for me.
This means Umar is still mine.
Maheen is in his life,
but I still rule his heart.
Hey,
you haven’t started eating.
Hey Imar, why the long face?
He had a headache last night,
that’s why.
what was the need to go to the roof at night,
you must have caught a cold.
Have this tea.
Thank you, I will have it.
Tell me,
what do you want for lunch?
Err…
Mama, we were leaving.
okay.
You can stay if you want.
No, she will go with you,
you will have visitors that will come,
it doesn’t look nice.
Mama forgot her veil,
let me get that.
I don’t want to stay myself.
Its not right to leave you,
what will you think.
What do you think,
I am contemplating suicide?
God forbid.
Have something..
Yeah
What happened to Umar?
He came and left.
Must have had something to do.
Hey, what can be more
important in his life than you?
I have heard that
thing you get easily you
don’t respect them,
but he got you with difficulty,
he should stay close.
Okay, I am sure he went to the shrine.
I will talk to him when he comes,
I will ask him what he did.
Hey did you not go to school?
I took a day off for Maheen.
even when there is a storm,
you don’t take the day off,
how did you do it now?
Why does Mahi need to?
I thought I would give her company,
make her comfortable.
Mahi is at her uncle’s home not with
strangers that you make her comfortable.
Do we scare her?
mama, you take
everything I say wrong.
You don’t want me to be friends
with anyone at home,
then you complain to Mansoor that
I don’t get close to anyone at home.
wow, you never thought of
getting close to us.
Mahi,
listen to me,
stay away from her,
she is cunning.
Stay away.
She must be cursing me, right?
No aunt.
Don’t cover up,
I know her well,
if you listen to her you wont be
able to settle down in this home,
just like her, she has not made
a place in this home or our hearts.
Stay away.
What is this?
I had told you stay home for a day 
after your reception and then join work.
I thought what would I do at home.
he was dying of sadness.
ok whatever, go home early, 
in fact go to the market,
get something for the 
reception and on this Friday,
take Maheen to Swat 
or Nathiagali, ok?
see.
Hello.
Why were you not 
answering my phone?
Oh,
your new wife would 
have been with you,
that is why you 
didn’t answer.
Papa was here.
I want to meet you Umar.
I came to meet you last night,
so that you can say what you want,
take out your anger. 
But you..
look,
mama has told me the situation in 
which this wedding happened,
you were under so much pressure.
I usually get angry at you,
but I sympathize with you.
I am upset with you, 
but I cant hate you.
Get angry,
it will be easy for you
Okay,
then meet me,
I will see under how 
much pressure you were ,
how sad you were,
how disappointed you were 
breaking your promises for me,
then maybe I will hate you.
Hello.
Umar, you will meet me, right?
Tell me, where should I come?
Move.
Hey, what happened Najia?
Today was the limit,
she insulted me so much in front 
of the jew bride, left me with no respect.
When you know you and mama 
don’t get along why do you go downstairs?
This is the reason why papa 
sent me to this portion to avoid this.
Having a separate portion means 
you are not his son? I am not their daughter in law?
You can go, but I cant, why?
I am still the elder daughter in law,
she has been here for 2 days,
she is the favorite now.
She is the daughter in law, so am I, 
what is the difference?
Najia, you know well this 
wedding was against her will.
I had informed you before 
wedding you will have to compromise.
I am compromising.
I agree she doesn’t 
like her son's choice,
she wanted you to marry with her will, 
then why this double standard now.
I told you not to 
mention this again?
why? Why shouldn’t I?
What if she has poison for 
Maheen in her heart,
just like me.
You worry so much for her, 
never for me.
Even if I try to make things 
better between you and mama,
but you will ruin it Najia, 
with your tongue.
Roshni,
please for God's sake, 
stop crying.
I can’t see your tears,
you say anything, curse me,
but not these tears, please.
I don’t have the 
courage to curse you,
had you lied to me,
got rid of me,
it would have been easier 
to hate you, curse you.
I was helpless Roshni,
I swear to God.
Yes,
but I am your criminal.
You know Umar,
I feel me not being their was God's will
because I would have been tortured 
seeing you be someone else.
But you must have thought
the girl who didn’t stay for you for a moment, 
you wont wait for her either.
No why would I think like that for you.
I knew why you took this step.
You wanted me to send 
my family over to your home.
You were right in your place.
I even know that your mother sent you.
I got there and I found out why she sent me.
My proposal was there,
but I was tired to your promises,
I have faith you would 
fulfill you promises.
But you gave up Umar,
but I didn’t I stood 
strong and said no.
You said no?
Yes, I said no.
Mama really got upset,
but I didn’t care.
I being a weak girl, 
lived up to my promises. Umar you…
Roshni, forgive me please.
There is no point of 
apologizing or regretting it.
I told her I would marry someone I like,
not a rich man she chooses.
I don’t care about money and home.
I loved you, not your wealth Umar.
Now mama is asking me when the 
boy will come with their proposal
and I have no answer. What do I tell her?
The boy I left everything for,
he, he was…
see this mama, 
all this is Mahi's jewelry.
Get it polished, 
there is no shine.
Mama, it is still gold, 
there was no time.
People will see it and know it’s 
at least 15-20 tolas and Zakia,
she gave her nothing
Those people were imbeciles,
they had told Zakia that there should be at least 6-7 sets.
She with difficulty
and adding her own gold 
was able to make 12 tolas.
Now 6 sets in 12 tolas 
means nothing.
thanksGod we got rid of those people or 
they would have cursed for these sets.
It’s just me who said nothing.
Don’t say anything.
Hello aunt.
Hello. Hello my queen. 
Come. Come sit.
This Razia didn’t make you stuff 
but she got great dresses for you
see Maheen, these are all for you,
mama says they don’t shine,
we will give it to the jeweller after 
the reception and get it polished
Now Najia will get upset,
you gave her 2 dresses and a set of gold.
let her get upset, 
I am upset at her.
Okay, will you go show 
her the dress or not?
Yes mama, I will get it, 
hold this.
I will get it.
what is it Maheen?
You look upset, you don’t talk.
No grandma, nothing like that.
I apologize on Razia's behalf,
she said yes to me and Fareed and 
she will take her anger out on you.
Same she did with Najia.
She is fine with you, 
but you are away from her.
No, I didn’t mean that grandma,
I will try.
Look, you are at no strangers,
you have your grandma 
and uncle here. ,
Look child the sooner you 
make a heart in Razia's heart,
the better.
She runs the home,
Faris and Umar are in her control.
If she doesn’t like you, 
then she will treat you like Najia.
She is strong she stands up,
what will you do?
Yes grandma.
Where do you go alone?
I had some work
what work? That you had to go alone,
you have never done that. I don’t like 
you roaming out in the market like this,
if you had asked me, 
I would have come along.
Have you ever gone with me to the market?
you used to go with Maheen 
or the girls in the locality,
what was the need to go alone?
mama, should I have Maheen stick with me?
When she went to her in laws, 
did she take me along that I take her?
Hey Zakia came.
So?
It’s the reception, we have to go. 
You be ready.
Reception.
Yes, Maheen's. We have to go.
mama they not invited in wedding 
why we go Reception
have you gone mad, Roshni?
We were invited,
you left everything and went to Shahista.
but mama that wedding never happened.
Did she call us to Umar's wedding?
She didn’t even let us know, 
let alone invite us.
Oh God, Roshni,
I feel since you have come from 
Shahista's you have gone mad.
I just told you everything how hasty the wedding was.
Now will you make this the reason to not 
attend the wedding of your childhood friend.
She had nothing in her control,
not doing the wedding, 
nor saying no.
why didn’t she have control?
She could have said mo,
but madam got ready 
that too to get married.
Roshni, I cannot reason with you.
Cunning woman.
