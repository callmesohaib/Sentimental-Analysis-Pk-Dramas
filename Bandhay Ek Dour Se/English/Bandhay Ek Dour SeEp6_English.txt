Where are you?
What are you doing sitting here?
Give him this.
One minute, look at this.
My  beloved Roshni.
Yes,
I will still call you beloved,
you are upset, still.
Umar.
Umar, I have some work, come please.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
Sorry, man.
Okay, I shouldn’t have
doubted Roshni like this,
should I hold my ears?
What are you doing?
Put your hands down,
what will people think?
Talk to the groom, go.
Okay, forgive me.
I am not upset with you,
I can never be upset with you,
you are my best friend
and the secret keeper of my love.
I hope my love survives.
Don’t worry.
Hey, fix that.
These people ignore things a lot.
I was waiting for so long,
I am bored sitting at home,
don’t know where aunty is.
You too have come right now.
Are you not tired since morning?
No, I don’t get tired,
aunt Shahista gave me the responsibility
for handling two rooms.
Actually uncle is coming,
and he is really fussy about things,
so mama is conscious.
She wants everything to be perfect.
Aunt never thought of me like that,
I am also a guest,
God knows where aunt is and you came at 12.
Okay,
you consider us your guests?
You are our own,
specially mama thinks you are our own.
I didn’t know that you
will have complaints like strangers.
Okay, did you eat?
No, I am hungry.
Lets order pizza.
Chicken Tikka.
Yes.
I came here with the hope to meet you,
the dream to make you mine,
the dream will come true soon Roshni,
you might have left disappointed,
please come back,
I am waiting for you.
DO you want something else?
Nothing.
Yes.
How do we play this?
I am too tired, you figure out yourself.
Your pizza is coming, I will go change.
Yeah,
yeah.
Man, Maheen,
I had told you earlier to tell him not message me,
I am busy,
I don’t want to talk to him.
On top of that, he is so cheap, class.
You tell him yourself, tell him that
I am happy seeing someone’s money and home,
we cannot live together, sorry.
Hello,
two proposals came for you too,
one had a general store and a rental home,
the other was an employee at WAPDA,
had his own home and a government home,
who did you say yes too? One minute,
one minute Roshni.
First thing,
I didn’t give anyone hope
or gave them false hope,
my mother kept both these
proposals in front of me,
and the decision was her too.
Man ,don’t be sarcastic.
Tell him not message me,
I don’t want to talk to him tell him
to forget me, ok?
or I will treat him bad.
What worse can you do Roshni?
Because of you,
he won’t be able to leave the wedding,
nor will he be able to fake a
smile in front of people.
His heart will be broken,
he won’t be able to do anything.
I am putting down the phone. Bye.
Hello. Hello.
Oh well. Oh God, the swimming pool.
Shahista, you now have a pretty home,
now get it in order get a daughter in law.
Think she is here.
Hello
Hello
Sister in law Shahista, you are really lucky.
Where did you get this maid from?
You like her that much?
I have been seeing her since I came
Then appreciate me.
Absolutely.
Almas, serve the food.
Have it.
Hey, where are you coming?
This is a function for girl.
You consider us girls.
No, I said no, so no.
Sister in law, I have to congratulate her. Move.
I said no, so no.
Come on move. hey..
Congratulations.
Umar. No.no.no. come on, eat it.
She is not here today,
she will come tomorrow.
Mama, eat it.
Hey No, you will have to.
Such a small  bite? Sister in law,
you too eat.
Hey…Come in front man,
what are you doing there? Come on.
Please,
Roshni, try and understanding.
It was a misunderstanding?
Misunderstanding?
If it was a misunderstanding
then why didn’t your mother clear it out?
You too stayed quiet.
Am I a servant of this home?
this is why I never wanted to shift to Pakistan,
I can’t take this family politics.
Look Roshni, my mother lives with her in-laws the
same way your mother lives with her in-laws.
I just cleared it all.
Roshni, I know you didn’t like it,
I swear to God, I feel really bad about it
but you will have to ignore a few things.
If you want to  live in this home,
then not just me and mama,
you too will have to ignore a few things,
so please ignore a few things.
Fine,
but only cause you asked me.
Please stop crying.
Come I will get you coffee, ok?
Not coffee, I will have ice cream
Fine, let’s have ice cream.
Hey, you sshould have stopped Mansoor,
his wife had to go to the parlor,
will he sit there for 3 hours and guard her?
Naija has the habit of keeping her husband close.
Brother Farid.
Yeah?
the boys family called.
Why? All ok?
They want us to send the
thing from the dowry
Why is that?
They are coming to the function in the evening,
we will send the things by tomorrow.
Its fine, Umar.
they are so weird, why the mistrust,
the thing would reach tomorrow.
No, they were saying, they will set the things
before the bride comes home.
Umar.
what happened? All ok?
you do one thing, go…
Papa, I cannot go anywhere,
we are doing something.
What are you doing? For the past 3 days you
have been dancing and singing and nothing else.
Mahi’s things need to be delivered at her in laws,
arrange a leader.
we need to deliver it today?
Are we sending her away too?
why would we do it today?
Zakia, you can never be sure,
like those people became stubborn,
that the wedding should be
done on the mendhi,
now they are asking for the things,
you never know, they might want
to take her after the wedding.
what are you saying?
Stop it now.
Why are standing? Go now.
okay, its not been 2 minute…
Okay listen, tell Nofil to… they don’t seem
like good people.Okay, stop. Stop it now
my son is tired.
Fine,
we will meet tomorrow at 5 PM. Bye
your tea.
I spoke to your mother on the phone,
I thought she would come, but…
But the thing is,
mama said that you have gone,
that’s enough.
Mana cannot travel so much in old age.
Okay, had she come,
I would spoken to her myself.
regarding?
You. If she was here,
I would spoken in detail and
she would have seen our home
and how happy you are here.
It would have been easier for her to decide.
Decide?
Anyway, I will talk to her myself.
I don’t think she will say no.
What do you think?
should I get you something else?
no, tea is enough
Nimco?
Err.. Noodles?
Macaroni, spaghetti, I can cook it all.
yes, that’s good.
Right now tea is fine.
Okay.
Shahista has gone mad,
do you talk to a girl like this about relations?
You have no shame,
you are talking to your mother like this?
Mama,
the one who is shy is at loss.
You should be happy,
instead of that you are scolding me.
will be happy the day she brings a proposal.
I know she is accustomed to ways abroad
and she also has a lot of money
but this doesn’t mean we have forgotten our
customs and we are no useless people,
tell her when she gets the
proposal I will think about it.
Mama, you…
Okay, stop it, put down the phone,
I need to iron  the clothes and get ready,
I have to go to Maheen’s mendhi.
Yes, you go get ready. Bye
Bye.
maheen’s engagement.
I feel, Maheen told Umar everything,
that is why that idiot isn’t calling.
Anyway, I got rid of him.
Where is the remote for the TV? Oh.
Keep the things. Where is everyone?
Where are the sweets?
Not here. Give it to me.
Get more if there is more.
Hurry up. Umar. Yeah.Umar.
what happened?
I heard you got fever.
Look, you found out that the groom wears a wig,
he is 4 ft tall. No problem, for humanity sake,
he must be good at heart.
Umar, please. Have to talk to you.
what Maheen, it’s late now,
I have dropped your dowry stuff there,
you should have told me earlier.
You had a message, I would have given it.
Umar, can you ever be serious in your life?
Maheen what is the point of being serious now?
What had to happen, happened.
What? I had told you not to say
yes looking at the picture only,
I also told you, I told you,
I will take you to meet him, but you didn’t agree.
Get the sweets man!
Everyone is working.
Umar, listen to me once. Please..
Maheen, a lot of work needs to be done,
you are bothering me.
come here.
What happened? Listen to me for 2 minutes,
it’s for your own benefit. I am serious.
one minute, nothing can be done now.
We can only be patient and
be thankful for what we have.
Umar..
Umar is right, Maheen, forget everything.
Umar, take this and go out, you come inside.
You have high fever..
I have to talk to Umar. Do it later, come on.
the fever isn’t going down aunt.
If she eats, I will give her medication.
I gave her the medication.
Mama, I feel dizzy.
Once the wedding gets done, you sleep,
I won’t let anyone come in the room.
Zakia. Yeah?
come outside, your brother is calling.
yes, he must be calling for the wedding.
I will come.
Yes, he wants to talk about that,
come on. Come. Why?
Nothing, your brother will tell you,
come on.
what do those people want to talk about now?
No, don’t worry, nothing like that.
The elders will sort it. You lie down.
move. Lie down, put your feet up.
Sister, I feel dizzy, check please.
I will.
Zakia, you remember well?
how can I forget?
They never mentioned a car.
and how could they do it?
Did they not see the home,
where did they see cars parked here?
Speak slowly. What is wrong?
But those people are saying
that they spoke of a car being given
and that didn't reach with the dowry.
Brother, I dont have the
money to give a car for dowry.
Why dont you talk to them?
I will, you too come along,
remember the guests are still here so no one should find out.
Mama, for God's sake,
dont get emotional and promise them a car.
where will we get a car in one night.
In fact, uncle, leave mama,
let me talk to those people.
You dont understand these matters.
Uncle,
this is wrong,
right at the time of the wedding,
with a home full of guests,
they cannot blackmail us.
You be quiet.
Umar come here.
Yes papa.
You take him to the roof,
he wants to ruin everything.
Man, elders are here, they will talk.
Take him upstairs, don’t bring him
back till I tell you.
Okay.
Uncle, you…
okay, you people talk.
Come on, let them talk.
He doesn’t understand the crisis we are in,
you don’t worry,
we will find a solution, don’t worry.
Look, at time of the proposal,
you knew our condition.
My sister in law is a widow and lives quietly.
So when she didn’t make any tall claims,
then how can you put such
a condition suddenly?
Mr. Fareed,
you are talking like we have said
something out of this world.
Here when giving dowry,
people get plots written in their name,
we have asked for an ordinary car.
We didn’t ask for a Mercedes.
No, you can give the car as per your standing,
we need to have a good name in the family,
that we left all the proposals from the family
and are getting a girl from outside,
so the in-laws gave us so much respect,
or else…
Sister,
I still respect you,
but how can I agree to something
that is not in my control.
Yes, but lets find out,
that how did you think of the
car at the time of the wedding.
We didn’t know we would have
to say it ourselves,
when you sent the dowry we found out,
wood and utensils.
The jewelry was not great.
I was thinking you saved the money for the jewelry,
you got the car,
when I asked, I found out there was no such plan,
not even a cycle.
When you have imagined all this yourself,
then there is no fault of ours.
I mean, if you had mentioned this earlier,
I would have somehow done
something to get it.
Stop it, how would you have gotten a car?
Right now, the fridge and
AC was gotten with difficulty.
hear that, this was the home you
 found to get the wedding done.
I told you,
check properly.
They took loans to get the fridge.
How was I to know, they just had one daughter,
or else people who have 3-4 daughters have 
made such preparations and have things ready.
What sort of a mother is she?
She had nothing for her only daughter.
what are you people doing?
Should I tell your parents? 
Go down.
what is wrong Monis,
they were just talking. Relax man.
I don’t know I am scared man.
God knows what we will 
hear from downstairs.
Scared of what?
Look man,
Maheen is a great girl,
I have faith nothing wrong will happen,
you will see.
Papa is there,
he will make a good decision. You will see,
nothing will happen by the will of God.
You will see. sit down.
The weather is good.
Yes. right?
I hope all is good downstairs.
It will be, you are thinking again.
Najia, come, have food.
What happened?
Nothing, they are talking.
Did the guests leave or are 
they still waiting for the wedding?
Yes,
the distant ones left,
but some are waiting, not for the wedding, 
but to see the scene.
Mansoor,
leave this food
and bring your father out,
he doesn’t understand my signs.
What happened?
He is agreeing to all the boys family says,
all that is left for him is to beg. 
He has begged them already.
mama, obviously,
papa considers Maheen his daughter.
mama, let him handle it, what can I do?
you are not getting it idiot,
if your father in emotion agrees to the term,
then Zakia will put us in it that brother you
 agreed to it, you get the car.
Now tell me,
another expense on our head,
the dowry list is long and then another car.
Why would we get it?
Its obvious, a small car even cost 1 to 1.2 million,
for the dowry I said yes,
cause Zakia is worried I said 
yes to the dowry,
now do we get into a debt for 
those greedy people.
You put down the plate and 
get your father before he agrees.
okay, I am going out. Maheen, 
child.. you rest, all is fine.
is all ok?
child, I said nothing, i will come.
Mahi,
I said it's nothing,
you rest.
If there is something us elders are here.
 Dont worry. where is mama?
Najia, take care, I will come.
you go, I will see.
Mahi, all will be fine, dont worry.
Leave it brother,
I have heard elders saying that the
 time of wedding is a blessed time,
we are wasting time in arguments.
we are getting late, the guests have to go.
we have to go Mr. Fareed?
without the wedding? Dont do that.
Look sister,
we are respectable people
and we dont like moving away from our word
and in this situation it's not that 
we are ending the proposal for car,
we have a heart too.
why did you get up then?
You said the wedding will be 
done on the night of the function,
then let us fulfill our duty.
Tell me something Mr. Fareed.
Yes.
are you fulfilling your duty or trying to 
get rid of the burden of the girl off your heads?
We are giving you a chance
 to fulfill the duty as a duty.
What do you mean?
you have time till tomorrow,
we will bring the family tomorrow
and will marry your daughter too.
In the same car. That is the dowry car.
Brother. Brother, listen…
Brother, don’t do that. Brother…
I am talking, wait. Brother, Mr. Jahangir.
Come on.Listen brother.
That’s it. Hey, where did those people go?
check outside. one minute Mr. Jahangir,
 listen…Brother…
what happened?
Go see your father. Listen to me… 
We have heard enough
What happened Zakia? 
When is the wedding?
nothing, it will be tomorrow. Come on.
Maheen.
Maheen.
Maheen.
Maheen.
God have mercy. Maheen. Maheen.
Maheen.
Maheen. Mansoor. Mansoor.
Nabeel, I will talk to them tomorrow.
But mama,
please be careful of one thing you 
will not be pressurized by uncle.
You will have the final decision.
what is wrong son,
your happiness is my happiness, 
I will make the decision you want.
Hey, when will your mother come? 
I have been calling her for so long.
I spoke to her, but…
But what?
If she was here, I would talk to her in detail.
She wants that you go to her yourself and..
No I stayed there for so long, I met all relatives,
I cannot go there again.
why do you have a long face on everything,
if you want, I can talk to aunty.
you will talk to her?
Its my decision, I will talk.
she knows us for so long,
I don’t think she will say no.
It’s true we are distant relatives, 
but it’s the same family.
but mama, I feel you 
should ask what Roshni thinks,
it’s important for her to decide too.
What objection can she have.
Roshni, you will live with us, right?
trust me, I don’t have an issue if you 
want to continue your education.
If you want to go to an academy or 
home tuition I can arrange that.
Hey no, I spoke to Zubaida,
she doesn’t want to study,
so she didn’t study beyond Fsc.
mama, I feel girls should complete 
their education, right?
Yes,
I was thinking to tell Zubaida to stop 
worrying about her wedding,
we will find a good proposal
and marry her here.
what is wrong? Did you break something?
Nothing madam, I am cleaning up.
what happened?
The long face again.
Okay, we will not marry you without asking you.
Fine, we will not fix your wedding 
without asking you. Mama, you worried her.
fine, I won’t talk about it. I was just saying
 that I will talk to Zubeda that we took your responsibility,
we will also fulfill the 
responsibility of your wedding.
Her  burden will be reduced.
We are not from the people who get money
 and forget their old relatives,
I am always trying to help people out.
