Mama.
What are you doing, aunt?
Mama.
Leave me. I will not leave her.
Mama…
Tell me, what happened?
Don’t ask me anything, Monis.
You went to Roshni’s home, right?
Tell me what did you talk about there?
You always had a complaint that I wanted to get
rid of my daughter from my head as a burden.
I still want to see her in her home.
A daughter is not a burden,
the burden is the thinking
that the society shows us.
Still, tell me, what did they say?
Just let me be quiet.
I had never thought that
I would talk about this to
my daughter and daughter in law.
You can talk about everything
with your daughter,
go ahead.
Maheen only two people are
standing with Umar at this moment,
one is me and the other is you.
I maybe am supporting him because
whatever he is saying and doing,
I am responsible for it,
and also because I am scared
that he will become a rebel.
But
I don’t know why are you supporting him?
But child,
I feel hesitant in supporting him.
I..I don’t.
I don’t want to mistreat you, Maheen.
Tell me uncle,
what do you want?
What is your decision?
Heart.
My heart says that in every
decision you will be mistreated,
living with Umar and
not living with Umar too.
So,
I give you the right to decide.
What do you want uncle?
A daughter’s decision easily
becomes a father’s wish.
Child, I want that you always live with us,
even if not as a daughter in law,
but as a daughter.
Don’t consider this my selfishness,
that I want your support in old age.
I don’t want to give Zakia
another shock, Maheen.
So,
so, then,
then we will decide for Umar.
I mean, is me living here your condition?
I am not in a position to put
conditions in front of my son.
I have hopes from my daughter,
I can talk to her,
so I am not putting a condition,
I am requesting her.
Uncle, order.
Order me.
I don’t want to tie you down, child.
Look,
if you feel that your life will be wasted,
then you have a right
to speak up about it.
But don’t make any decision hastily,
Zakia, already…
Uncle.
Uncle,
I will live here.
I will live here with you,
till you want
You got me here,
when you think its feasible,
you can drop me back.
Just don’t mention this to Umar.
Now if you are satisfied from my side,
then satisfy Umar as well.
Live long.
Live happy.
If it was just about Umar,
we would have beaten him 
and made him understand.
But we are upset at her, 
she is supporting Umar.
She has almost convinced her father in law.
Zakia, make your daughter understand,
control her,
I fear that she will leave alone
 with her husband as the groom.
The fun people had 
to poke fun at us is done,
people had to curse us, they did.
But Zakia, you too will have to 
keep your daughter at home.
She doesn’t want to live here, 
she wants someone else to live here.
But I want that you always live with us,
if not as our daughter in law,
 then as a daughter.
Don’t consider this my selfishness that
in old age,
I want your support.
I don’t want to give Zakia
 another shock, Maheen.
Hello mama.
What?
Has your anger cooled down?
Are you upset with me?
Mama, what is the matter?
Roshni is saying that…
What?
What was Roshni saying?
Maheen, why didn’t you 
tell me about Umar and Roshni?
What would have I told you?
Anyway, you found out now, mama.
Now…
Mama.
Mama, you tell me yourself,
if those two wanted,
then they could have considered this wedding 
something written in fate and accepted it,
and separated.
But they couldn’t separate.
Then,
then what is the guarantee
that this will happen in future?
Walking on the blade of a sword and
waiting for all my life, that maybe,
maybe he will come back?
Isn’t it better that you set him free.
But you will not be free Maheen.
You are a widow mother’s orphan child.
You will not be free.
What Roshni is saying today, 
the whole world will say tomorrow.
What did Roshni say?
She...
She said that…
Aunt,
I am respecting you,
if you want to know the real thing, 
then ask your daughter.
What else?
No woman lets her husband meet 
another woman without a reason.
Mama, she is really cunning,
she wants that the world doesn’t 
blame her for leaving Umar,
and the whole world sympathizes with her,
that Umar was having an affair.
Hey, she herself wants to leave Umar, 
she wants freedom from him.
What nonsense is this?
 Why would my Maheen do this?
How would I know?
Go ask her.
She must have her eyes on someone else.
Till the time, you don’t make arrangement for 
the second from the first, what girl does this?
Maheen.
Maheen.
You don’t worry mama,
God protects respect.
I have protected someone’s respect,
so by the will of God,
I will also get respect.
Please remove the fear in your heart,
I am not coming back home.
I am here,
and I will live here
and by the will of God,
no one will throw this dirt on you.
Don’t worry mama.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
We were waiting for you.
 Have a seat.
What happened papa? 
Is everything ok? So much silence.
Silence?
Call it a mourning.
Razia.
Now it’s a mourning for us,
it’s a celebration for him,
its his victory,
he should play the trumpet.
Let me talk.
After thinking hard,
we have decided to agree to you, Umar.
Not us Mr. Fareed, just you.
And not agreeing to what you say,
but giving up.
But on one condition.
Its not a condition for you,
it was a condition for Maheen 
and she agreed,
that is why the decision has 
been made in your favour.
You have no responsibility on your Umar,
apart from this,
that your name will be 
attached to her till she wants.
Maheen is my responsibility and 
I will live up to it, till my last breath.
This was the only condition
 that Maheen has agreed to.
Now no matter who comes in your life,
Maheen will not leave from here.
Maheen will not leave from here.
Why did you agree, Maheen?
Rest assured Umar,
I will not be an issue for you.
And what about the issues that
 will be created for you, those?
Get up.
Sit here.
Sit.
Look Maheen,
Roshni loves me a lot
and I don’t want that she sits waiting in my love,
 for my sake, all her life and ruin her life.
That is why the situation came to this.
You don’t even love me,
then why are you doing all this for my sake?
Why are you burdening me so much?
I am doing all this to reduce your burden, Umar.
If I hadn’t done this,
uncle would never have taken this decision.
For my sake, you accepted the decision.
Why did you do it?
Why are you doing all this?
Tell me.
Because.
because…
Now don’t say that
 you are my childhood friend,
or you are my cousin.
There is something else that
 is forcing you to do all this.
Speak up.
Love.
This girl is an idiot,
she is doing all this for her friend’s love.
Who knows,
if its for her friend’s love or Umar’s love.
Umar’s love?
Impossible.
How can a woman share her husband
 with another woman in love.
Love has thousand colors,
some loves are crazy like yours,
and some love is really patient.
Really peaceful on the top
 but deep on the inside.
Who knows,
that girl really loves Umar, 
so much that we can’t even imagine.
Love?
Love.
That I have with uncle, 
aunt, with mama.
This is the desire of that love,
that I give them that peace and comfort
that they get knowing 
that I am with them here.
This love has given me a lot,
we have a lot of debt of our elders on us,
which I might not have been
 able to repay it all my life.
But now,
God has given me a chance that 
I can return a little bit of that the love.
After all,
what better can I get than living under 
the shadow of uncle and love of aunt.
I understand now.
What happened? Is everything ok?
Hey, when I am alone, 
you come immediately.
Today, didn’t you know how long 
I have been walking alone?
I was in your sister in law’s custody.
Not all wives are like your Maheen,
 that they give them a freehand
and they can do whatever they want.
Come on, lets go on the roof.
Come on. Come.
Roshni,
what you said to Zakia,
Was all of it true?
Which one?
That Maheen wanted to marry someone else.
You know, I don’t believe it,
 that she wanted to marry someone else.
Mama, she is the good, I am bad!
Then tell me, who was it?
I don’t know, it must be someone.
Damn it, were you blaming her?
You have any idea,
 how big of sin is it to blame someone.
Oh God, mama, why would I do it?
I don’t have such habits,
that is why I didn’t investigate further.
Umar knows everything.
Really?
Then he is really a shameless man,
that he is with his wife even 
after knowing everything.
Shameless?
Umar is an educated and enlightened man,
he will keep me really happy 
and care for me.
Especially when he finds out 
that I fixed his broken heart,
when Maheen was leaving her and going.
This thing has spread so much 
and you have become so egoistic,
that now we just need to get the proposal.
You will praise my far sightedness,
 how I have secured my future.
Money is nothing,
I have seen a lot of rich people,
they are poor at heart,
but someone as simple as Umar,
its difficult to get in this world.
You will see.
Just once.
Brother, just once had she protested,
I swear to God,
I would have given up.
But it doesn’t matter to her,
that she lives with me or not,
whether my name is with her or not.
It doesn’t matter to her.
Does it matter to you?
It matters to you Umar,
but are not accepting it
and its possible, 
she herself is hesitant to accept it.
Umar, she went for a few days,
did you look at your condition?
You say that you didn’t accept her 
as your wife, from your heart.
But the pain of her leaving was 
something you couldn’t tolerate
and this is what you were upset about that 
how did she think of separating from you.
Its not that.
I was…
First listen to me carefully Umar.
Don’t try to cheat me the same way you 
have been cheating yourself for so long.
When someone’s deepest desire is fulfilled 
they don’t have a sad face,
like you have right now.
Why are you not happy 
that papa agreed to you?
Because he didn’t agree to it with his heart,
and I also know, 
no one is happy in my happiness.
First you become happy with your happiness
and think that when Maheen said
that she doesn’t want to live her 
life with you at any cost,
she dislikes you a lot,
then why did you feel so hurt?
And when now she is not stopping you
from being someone else’s,
then why are you so disappointed?
Why do you want her to stop you?
What do you want her to say?
Think Umar.
Think.
I am really upset with sister Maheen,
she doesn’t want to live in her home and 
she didn’t even let my home be settled.
Look Fazeela, I respect your emotions,
but right now, the mental stress and 
torture my sister is going through,
you cannot even imagine.
All of this are your sister’s actions.
Roshni?
I cannot expect anything from someone 
as cunning as Roshni.
But your sister,
at least she should have stopped,
once we got married,
she would have gotten her 
husband married again.
All this is not that easy for Maheen.
If you were in her place…
God forbid if I were in her place.
Still if I was in her place,
I wouldn’t have done something so stupid.
Sister Maheen has decided that 
she will ruin her own life,
she will stay alone,
but she wants to do this with all of us,
she is ruining the happiness of everyone.
And this Roshni?
I will not leave this Roshni, 
I am telling you!
After all, what is left to be done?
One decision of Maheen,
has tied her brother’s hands
and if you look at it,
I feel Maheen is more responsible,
 than Roshni.
Monis, we are not talking about 
who is to blame and who not.
Right now we are talking about
 that my life is ruined.
We are not getting married, Monis.
One wedding is not happening,
the other is getting ruined.
Its all the fault of this wedding,
 the wedding has ruined everything!
What? Really?
They agreed?
Or else I was going to tell you a scheme 
with which they would agree.
Its good it wasn’t needed.
What happened?
Are you not happy?
No.
Don’t I look happy?
I am happy.
Obviously, man.
So then tell me, 
what date are we fixing?
Because my mother is in a hurry,
because Maheen’s mother created a scene.
So mama is worried that
 the people in the locality will find out.
She is right.
I think my family will come over
to your home in a day or two.
By the will of God.
Fine.
That.
We will just have a simple wedding.
Why?
Its your second wedding,
its my first wedding.
I will have some wishes.
I know. I understand,
but see the situation 
we will just get married.
Okay, leave it.
After all, you will be with me, 
so each day will be a celebration.
Let these people do what they want.
There is something else.
What happened now?
Papa agreed to the wedding, but
he has said that
I can get married, but
I cannot leave Maheen.
Why can’t you leave her?
 What do you mean?
Lower your voice, everyone is listening.
He has put a condition.
Did you agree to this condition?
Roshni, papa has listened to so much I said,
but this is not in my control,
its his decision.
