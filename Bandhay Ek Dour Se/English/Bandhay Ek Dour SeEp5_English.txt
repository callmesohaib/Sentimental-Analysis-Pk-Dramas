Come downstairs,
come on, the cat will catch you.
What happened Mahi?
I was waiting for your call.
Yes,
sorry,
I was busy with work at
home and forgot to call.
Meaning, when its my job,
you got busy. You forgot.
It was a small thing,
I just said deliver the gift and
let me talk to her from your phone.
She told me not to call,
she doesn’t have an issue with you calling.
Umar,
whether you do it this way
or that way, it’s the same.
When she said no to talk to you,
then you know what that means.
Yes, but I wanted to wish her
on her birthday. Try and understand.
You promised not to call right,
she didn’t.
if she wants, she can call you.
She is a little stubborn.
Anyway, if she is not stubborn with me,
who would she be stubborn with.
Tell me, how did she like the gift?
Speak up.
That…mama was unwell,
so I couldn’t give her the gift.
Here you go!
I gave you one small task,
you couldn’t do that.
Sorry, I will give the gift.
Promise.
Umar, don’t get upset.
Hey stay at home on the holiday,
you are ready to leave again.
I have just one off day,
I have a 1000 things to do.
Go madam, do you work,
I don’t want you to sit with me,
I am talking about Mansoor,
he should spend time
with us on the off day,
Mama, why…
Hello aunt!
Hello sister in law, how are you?
Me? I am like this.
If you don’t miss your train,
go make me cup of tea before you go.
Sure.
Come.
Where is grandma?
Where would grandma be?
I have to sit alone on a holiday,
my son is taken away by his wife,
and the husband with his mother,
God knows what shrine they want to.
Najia, get tea quickly.
Why tea in such hot weather.
Headaches don’t care about hot or cold weather.
I will have tea, I will feel better.
Najia, just get one cup of tea,
Monis is feeling hot.
Okay, Monis, tell me more,
how is aunt?
Mama is fine nowadays.
Yes, she only gets other unwell.
No, I get that, but you hear me child.
Hello.
Oh no, he is saying,
he is coming to get you.
What? Such a good news.
Mama, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.
I will tell you that I will go for sure.
Are you mad?
How do I let you go with a single man alone?
What alone travel.
He will take me on the plane,
it won’t be empty, there will be people.
Aunt Shahista is calling me
and I don’t go anywhere.
Please.
Be quiet and sit, you have never stayed
with your uncle and aunt, but you will go here.
Tell me something,
there is no girl your age in Shahista’s
home, what would you do there?
Oh mama, I don’t get it what
girls have smart mothers.
Don’t you get it? Aunt
Shahista is being nice to me,
why is she calling me there, and
how many times she told you she likes me.
Okay, so this is the deal.
Then it will look even worse
living there like this.
Mama, they are modern people,
they don’t care about such things.
She wants that before marriage,
I see the environment of their home,
them. Its good for me.
That is fine,
but if they send the proposal properly,
it would have been good.
Mama,
they will send the proposal,
you first give me the permission.
I feel you gave me permission,
I am going to go pack,
you too come quick.
Roshni!
Aunt, mama has sent this
card for Mahi’s wedding.
God damn it!
This is the respect of sister in law and brother
in law that kids are bringing us invitations.
Aunt, mama will come,
she will surely come,
she was a little busy.
If she had to come herself,
why would she send the card through you?
This is how she respected us.
Mama,
Monis came thinking
he would meet his aunt this way.
You be quiet.
You take this card and go back and return
it to the one who loses her respect coming here.
Aunt, I came with a lot of hope,
what will I say going back?
Say anything, go to hell.
Mama…
you come to my room,
we will go upstairs.
Monis…
Umar, I say be quiet.
Hey, at least, respect the guest
who has come to your home.
My home. My guest.
You go madam, go and roam on
the streets with my beloved son. Go.
This is the limit,
talking this home is a pain.
Then don’t!
I am not!
Mama, what did you do?
Be quiet.
You shouldn’t have sent
Monis away like this.
I say be quiet.
You shouldn’t have done this.
Auhhuumm,
Damn it, the tea is without sugar,
its poison!
I will get you tea.
Hello.
Brother Monis, listen…
I am driving the bike,
I will talk to you when I get home.
I have told you
so many times not to call.
I can hear the bike, hello,
hello, you didn’t cut the call,
hello. Hello?
Hello,
brother Monis.
Hello.
Hello.
Brother Monis, hello,
can you hear me?
Mama. Mama!
Could you not wait for me to come back,
what was the point of dragging the
kids in the personal matter?
I didn’t drag her,
Zakia sent Monis,
you tell me honestly,
wasn’t it something that would angry you.
Fine,
you should have complained,
told him you didn’t like it.
You could have told me.
I would have insulted Zakia myself asking
her this is no way to invite someone to the wedding.
Why did you insult that
kid and send him away.
I didn’t insult him.
Don’t lie Razia,
Najia told me everything.
You not only told him to go to hell,
you were even cursing him for 2-3 days.
Fear God.
You have kids,
he is a kid, he is an orphan, he is my blood.
I will teach Najia a lesson,
first she turns my son against me and
then she also instigates my husband.
Papa.
Papa. Monis had
a serious accident.
I don’t know,
I don’t know what condition my son is in.
Oh God. Oh God.
God have mercy.
Grandma, have water,
it will all be fine by the will of God.
Where is Mansoor?
I had to go to the hospital,
where is he?
He is coming. He is coming.
He is parking the car and coming. Mansoor.
Okay, I got the car,
whoever wants to go to
the hospital come.
Son, I want to go,
take me to the hospital.
God knows
what my son is going through.
Grandma. Grandma, I spoke to papa,
all is fine, nothing to worry about.
Oh God.
Come on mama, come.
oh God.
This is why they say
you shouldn’t curse people,
at times what you say is accepted.
You stay quiet Najia,
this is not the time to say these things.
She has gotten up and left,
she has a stone heart.
Grandma, what…
I don’t have a stone heart,
I am a mother,
not a snake.
He played with my Umar in my lap.
Mansoor’s father left
alone worried in a hurry,
I was going to get money.
You may need it there mama,
I will just be back.
She is not bad at heart,
she just cant control her tongue.
Come son, come quick.
Come grandma, come.
Come here.
Sit down Zakia.
My son has bad luck.
I don’t know how a widow like me had
done preparations to marry off my daughter.
God be kind.
May He give my son health,
so that he is there for Mahi’s wedding.
Yes, God willing. Monis is fine,
he has regained consciousness. He will be fine.
God give Umar a long life,
may he get what he want,
he has supported us in this tough time
He is our own blood Zakia,
wont he be of use in such a time?
When will they release
him from the hospital.
At max 2 days.
2 days?
There is a lot of work at home for the wedding
and we are here at the hospital.
God is kind.
Yes, thank God,
he gave our son a new life.
Ok, this is the last spoon.
Come on. Okay.
Hey Umar, thank you.
I have heard that you made a
lot of effort to arrange the blood.
I gave two bottles of blood,
I will make you pay for it.
Do you get it?
Where is your mobile?
Should I take a picture?
I will send it to sister in law.
No man, not a picture.
If you send a picture in this condition,
she must be crying already.
Okay, then you rest for a while.
No, I want to talk to you.
Ouch. Ouch.
Yes, the preparation will be done.
Hello. I will keep my preparation ready,
as soon as you are done with your work,
I will come pick you up, okay?
Bye. Here you go.
Damn it, come here.
When I was talking,
why did you take the phone from me?
You finalized everything yourself.
Mama, you just gave permission,
why are you saying no?
So how was I to know that their wedding will
also come on the days when Mahi is getting married.
You tell me something,
she is your childhood friend,
wont you participate in her wedding?
Mama,
her brother had an accident and is in the hospital,
they will not get married in a week or 10 days.
They will extend it.
I would have said no to Nabeel
and then we found out the
wedding got postponed, how would I go then?
I can never travel
in the plane anyway,
you would never
let me take a train alone.
You are really strong headed,
get lost.
Listen,
my lovely mother,
you know they are holding a
big function for the home.
Get me good clothes made.
Okay.
The clothes you got made for Mahi’s wedding,
you will wear those only.
Mama, I cannot wear wedding clothes to a function.
People will call me a villager.
Go now.
Mama.
Mama, my love, listen to me.
Thank God brother is fine now,
I was worried.
Yes, God is great.
We still have some worries too.
Mahi, give me this tea,
I will give this to Razia and brother Fareed,
they are all standing there.
Okay listen,
there was some money at home, I got it,
you spend all the money for the hospital.
Yes, that is good. I spent all the money
I had on the operation and medicine.
Yes, we will do more, don’t worry,
Zakia might not have money.
She must have spent it in the
daughter’s wedding.
Something will be done.
Monis is like our younger brother,
we will do something. Don’t worry.
God willing.
God willing,
all will be fine, don’t worry.
Hey…
Hey, what was the need for it?
I got this for uncle, you take it.
Thank you.
It feels like aunt Zakia
and mama never fought,
they have developed
a strong bond.
I used to tell you earlier,
my mother is not bad at heart
and love wins everything.
If you treat her with love,
you will get love in return.
Leave it. Forget about it,
this is not love, its embarrassment.
She knows that her
curses almost killed Monis,
she is making amends.
Okay, this is good too,
or else in today’s world,
people are not embarrassed on
their actions or make amends.
As far as sister Zakia is concerned,
spend money and win her heart.
She had to melt,
papa made the expense,
and that was right.
I just say that if this had to happen,
I wish it happened earlier,
we would have gotten
Umar married there, right?
Why do you have the long face?
You should be happy
your brother is home fine,
your wedding date didn’t get pushed either.
You are joking, right?
How is this possible that you
will leave my wedding and go?
What can I do man?
Aunt Shahista kept the
wedding on the same date.
Now I cannot get the function date pushed
asking aunt Shahista, that is not in my hand.
You have going or not
going in your hands, don’t go.
How can I not go?
You are getting married,
I need to think about my wedding too.
Wedding?
Man, the thing is that aunt SHahista
chose me for Nabeel,
so she is forcing me to come
and meet her relatives,
see how they live. One thing is for sure,
our ways of living is different,
but I know myself, I can adjust.
Roshni,
Umar!
What Umar?
What Umar?
You forgot so soon what Umar?
Man, I will not wait for 
Umar and grow old.
For Nabeel’s proposal 
my parents agree,
how do I say no? 
Umar doesn’t have a job,
nor is he becoming capable to
bring the proposal to my home.
You are being hasty, don’t be hasty,
all is getting fine now.
Umar goes to work, 
he will also get a job,
the family will agree.
I will talk to mama, 
we will bring your proposal.
My parents have to 
accept the proposal,
why would they prefer 
Umar over Nabeel?
Everyone wants what is
best for their daughter.
Why don’t you say you
think what is best for you.
Think that,
what is wrong in that?
He loves you.
Nabeel too loves me.
Loves me?
He will die.
He wont die,
he is alive,
he is smart enough to know
that I am taking myself away from him.
That is why he moved away from me,
so he has his respect.
He hopes…
You can end his hope,
you have my permission.
What if I cannot come to your wedding,
my prayers are with you.
Are you blind?
Cant you see the car?
Are you blind?
When I am coming from this way,
you move your car.
Weird people,
they don’t know how to drive
and they take cars on the road.
What?
Razia.
Razia.
Give me my warm shawl.
Zakia’s open his open,
there is wind blowing.
Wow grandma, preparing hard.
Farid said come early,
it will be great.
I too will fulfill my wishes.
Look what I got for you.
For me?
Yeah.
Wow,
perfume.
Yes,
I thought my grandma should
look her best for the wedding.
What if you find a girl you like for me,
then when you ask for the proposal
wearing this perfume, it will be great.
You really want to get married?
Me?
Yes.
Not me, you really want 
me to get married,
I want to fulfill your wish,
my lovely grandma
Some more days Roshni,
you won’t even know I have
moved a lot of stones from the way,
I will give you this news myself.
Umar.
Where are you right now?
Listen to me. Come here soon.
What happened Maheen,
all ok? Is Monis fine?
Give it to me, I will talk.
Talk to grandma.
Hello. Yes child,
how are you?
How is your brother? All ok?
Oh, grandma is dying
to meet you two.
Yes, its fine. Child,
don’t worry, I am coming.
Okay child, bye.
Umar, come down.
What happened man?
Why are you not letting me go?
I cannot wait, 
I need to meet her.
I cannot wait anymore,
how many challenges do I take on,
how many bridges to I make.
hey,
She told me to meet when there is
a good news, now I have a good news.
Why don’t you want me to meet her?
Tell me.
Why are you not speaking?
You are not letting me speak.
Okay, do one thing,
message her to meet me on the roof,
don’t tell her about me,
I will surprise her
she will be happy. Right?
I don’t know.
What do you mean, you don’t know?
She will obviously be happy,
grandma has come with the
mission to find a girl for me.
You have to do something for me,
take her in front of grandma often.
I want her to be in grandma’s focus,
rest is my magic.
What man?
What happened to you?
You promised to make us meet,
why are you moving back.
I am not moving back.
Oh
madam is throwing tantrums,
she is getting married,
she has dreams, she is busy.
Okay, don’t do anything,
message her to meet me on the roof.
She won’t come to the roof,
she won’t come to the wedding.
What happened?
Did you two fight?
I wish I had fought,
when people fight they separate,
no one separates without a fight.
Why don’t you talk openly?
What is the issue, tell me.
Listen to me.
Someone relative of his,
distant relatives,
she has gone to meet him,
a cousin of her came to meet her,
he took her,
she is getting close to him and…
What nonsense Maheen?
What are you saying about Roshni?
That too, to me.
No.
I trust her completely.
She only loves me and you…
Roshni said right,
you will create
misunderstanding between us,
she was right,
I didn’t expect this  from you,
you should have supported me.
Damn it.
I knew you wouldn’t believe me.
When will we reach?
How long will it take?
The journey is long,
this one as well as life.
You are tired already?
No, I am not tired,
the car is really comfortable that
I don’t know about the time passing.
So all the magic is in my car,
so what about my company?
No, I meant that you are here,
so everything is
so good or else nothing
You know I could have
sent you a plane ticket
and called you,
but I recently imported this car, so I came.
I am sorry, I know this
would be hectic for you.
No I am fine, after all,
I will go home and rest.
The little tiredness
I have will go away
Okay, you do one thing,
you recline the seat and rest,
when you wake up,
we will be home.
Fine.
One thing is for sure,
you sleep well in rich people’s home.
Wow, the taste of water is different.
Wow.
Wow. Swimming pool.
Wow.
Where are you taking my things?
Madam said
I should take these things…
Where are you taking this?
Madam, you said I should shift
these things to the other room.
Yes.
This room is really good,
I have adjusted here, that is why.
Ahh,
Actually my in-laws are coming,
I thought I would give them this room.
But aunty you said you had
2-3 guest rooms for guests.
Yes, that is true, you do one thing,
you do one thing, get those two guest rooms cleaned properly,
I don’t want my in-laws have a
problem when they come.
Fine.
We will settle you later.
Roshni, you do one thing, help her.
Sure.
I am going out for something important,
I will come back and talk to you.
Sure.
Bye. Hey, where are you going?
Open the  bag, come on.
Come on pick it and keep it here.
Hurry up.
Where are you?
What are you doing sitting here?
Give him this.
One minute, look at this.
My beloved Roshni.
Yes, I will still call you beloved,
you are upset, still.
Umar.
Umar, I have some work,
come please.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
Sorry, man.
Okay, I shouldn’t have
doubted Roshni like this,
should I hold my ears?
What are you doing?
Put your hands down,
what will people think?
Talk to the groom, go.
Okay, forgive me.
I am not upset with you,
I can never be upset with you,
you are my best friend
and the secret keeper of my love.
I hope my love survives.
Don’t worry.
Hey, fix that.
These people ignore things a lot.
I was waiting for so long,
I am bored sitting at home,
don’t know where aunty is.
You too have come right now.
Are you not tired since morning?
No, I don’t get tired,
aunt Shahista gave me the responsibility
for handling two rooms.
Actually uncle is coming,
and he is really fussy about things,
so mama is conscious.
She wants everything to be perfect.
Aunt never thought of me like that,
I am also a guest,
God knows where aunt
is and you came at 12.
Okay,
you consider us your guests?
You are our own,
specially mama thinks you are our own.
I didn’t know that you will
have complaints like strangers.
Okay, did you eat?
No, I am hungry.
Lets order pizza.
Chicken Tikka.
Yes.
I came here with the hope to meet you,
the dream to make you mine,
the dream will come
true soon Roshni,
you might have left disappointed,
please come back,
I am waiting for you.
Do you want something else?
Nothing.
No thanks.
Yes.
How do we play this?
I am too tired,
you figure out yourself.
Your pizza is coming,
I will go change.
Humm,
Yeah,
Man, Maheen,
I had told you earlier to
tell him not message me,
I am busy, I don’t
want to talk to him.
On top of that,
he is so cheap, class.
You tell him yourself,
tell him that I am happy seeing
someone’s money and home,
we cannot live together, sorry.
Hello,
two proposals came for you too,
one had a general store and a rental home,
the other was an employee at WAPDA,
had his own home and a government home,
who did you say yes too?
One minute, one minute Roshni.
First thing,
I didn’t give anyone hope
or gave them false hope,
my mother kept both these proposals in
front of me, and the decision was her too.
Man ,don’t be sarcastic.
Tell him not message me,
I don’t want to talk to him tell
him to forget me, ok?
or I will treat him bad.
What worse can you do Roshni?
Because of you,
he won’t be able to leave the wedding,
nor will he be able to fake a smile in front of people.
His heart will be broken,
he won’t be able to do anything.
I am putting down the phone. Bye.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh well.
Ahhhh,
Oh God, the swimming pool.
