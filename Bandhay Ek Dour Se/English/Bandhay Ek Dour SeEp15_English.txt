Mama look at Umar,
he looks like a unique groom.
Yeah, look at his face, he is so lost.
All this happened all of a sudden,
but the reception…
Mama, look at this picture of your son
with Afzal uncle, he looks so happy.
Yeah.
Although he created a scene at aunt Ruqaiya’s home.
Fareed is really stupid.
Not a single picture of the bride
and groom is worth enlarging,
I paid the photographer for no reason,
I could have taken pictures from my phone.
Yeah, true.
I will ask Umar to go to a studio
and get a photo shoot done.
Yes, than that picture,
I will place here. Right here.
Yeah.
I will put it up here.
Yes, here.
It won’t be that big,
you wanted to cover the window.
Yes, only this portion.
Roshni was asking about you.
In fact, when she asked,
I realized I never asked you.
What?
That, are you happy or not?
I am happy.
Why won’t I be happy?
Now she will ask you,
why am I happy?
Tell her that because you
don’t consider me responsible for all this.
Maheen, the three of us are suffering for no reason.
How long will we suffer?
I don’t know when this punishment will end.
You know,
Roshni is less helpless as compared to us,
she can free herself from this hell and punishment,
if you set her free from yourself.
Maheen, I cannot do this at any cost.
Umar, don’t take me wrong,
I don’t have an issue with Roshni’s existence.
Umar, I know she is hurt,
but if she forgets all this
and starts a new life,
then the burden on your heart will reduce
and new doors will open for her.
She wants to sit on the same door and wait for me.
If I cannot make her mine,
then I cannot even force her to give up loving me.
She hopes that our love will have results,
she feels that
the two of us will become one, someday.
Roshni.
Roshni.
Can you not hear me?
Uh-huh.
You tell me, did you go to meet Maheen?
Yeah I did, what happened?
No actually I met Zakia and I mentioned you.
Zakia called Maheen at that moment,
Maheen said that Roshni
didn’t come to her in-laws to meet her.
I didn’t go to meet her at the in-laws.
But,
Zakia is saying that Maheen is saying that
she has not met Roshni in a long time,
so who do you go to meet 2-3 times in a week?
You know, I was embarrassed in front of Razia,
I told her it must have been Shaheen,
I must have misheard.
Mama, I don’t get it,
why do you want to talk
to everyone about everything?
Roshni, tell me honestly,
who do you go to meet?
Look, I am not the type of mother
who covers up for their children.
Yes mama,
you are the mother who ruins children
by telling their actions.
Why would I lie to you?
Maheen is the one lying.
Why would she lie?
And that too, to her mother?
Mama, her in-laws are really bad,
they don’t let her go out,
and there is no chance she can meet her friends.
She makes an excuse of going to her mother’s,
and meets me.
When aunt Zakia called her damned
mother in law must be there with her,
how would she tell the truth.
Hmmm…
but tell me something,
why is Maheen dying to meet you?
Why would she meet you every third day,
if her mother in law doesn’t like it,
she should sit at her in-laws,
when she comes to her mother she should meet you.
This is not how you make a home.
Mama, she is a human too,
she has wishes,
the husband doesn’t let her go anywhere,
doesn’t take her out, she has a lot of work,
she calls me, I too go.
That’s it,
sympathise with her as much as
that can be tolerated.
If she ruins her home cause of these actions,
who will be responsible for it?
To hell with the sympathies.
Amen.
Hello, yes Roshni,
what happened?
You had told me that you inform
Maheen before you come to meet me.
You also told me that you tell her everything
and you don’t hide anything from her.
Yes.
Then you must also have told her that
I made an excuse to come meet her, to meet you.
I don’t know,
I might have mentioned it.
But I don’t remember, why?
Not maybe,
what was the need for her to do this conspiracy.
What did Maheen do?
Maheen, in front of my mother and aunt Zakia said
that Roshni hasn’t come to meet me after the wedding,
what was the need to say this?
I got insulted.
No,
Roshni must not have said
anything like this on purpose.
I am sure there must be a reason.
Umar,
the whole world can say anything to me
and it doesn’t matter to you.
You are just worried that
no one blames Maheen and why is that?
Causes she is your wife and
its your duty to take care of her respect.
Even though,
she say what she wants when she wants.
Roshni.
Its useless to talk to you,
that is why I am going to my room,
so no one try to talk to me.
Yes, you have just one response to everything,
that you are Mansoor’s choice.
Aunt, stop it. Have water.
Why should I stop?
She is ill-mannered and has a bad tongue
and she tells me that I came here
because of Mansoor’s wish and liking,
that is why no one likes me.
Yeah, so what wrong did I say?
I have been married for so long
but this sorrow hasn’t left your heart
that you couldn’t get Mansoor’s wife by your choice
and this is something you keep
on reminding me time to time,
at times when I ask for oil and at times
when I just pass from in front of you.
Hey, I would have dragged out a stubborn
and ill-mannered daughter in law like you
but I always care for my son.
Yes, the only thing left for you
to do is drag me out of this house.
That is what you cannot do.
Sister in law you be quiet.
No, let her talk let her talk.
You too see and the world can
also hear the wife Mansoor got.
Hear me out,
I didn’t wish to bring a daughter in law I like,
but if Mansoor married you,
he should have been careful
and not ruined his life.
How did he ruin his life?
What mountain did I break on his head?
Don’t make me start,
he doesn’t even get food on time,
nor washed clothes,
you are so short tempered
and someone with a tongue like you,
who tolerates such a wife?
She is acting like she has borne us a heir.
I would have tolerated everything you said
if you had given my Mansoor a child.
You are a bitter seed, completely useless.
Ill-mannered, stupid girl.
Aunt, not having a child is not sister in law’s fault.
So it is my fault.
She runs her mouth, so it’s her fault.
Maheen, she became a liar in front of everyone.
Her mother scolded her separately.
What was the need to say all this?
How was I to know Umar?
When mama asked me if she came here or not.
I would have said what is the truth.
If you have told me,
I would have handled it, I really didn’t know.
I said the same to Roshni, but she said that…
What?
She must have felt that I did this on purpose,
so that you people cannot meet.
No, it’s not like that.
Actually, that is it, Maheen.
You know she loves me,
she is helpless at the hand of her love.
Love is misguiding.
Look Maheen,
if you ever feel that doubts your intentions,
or she says something,
then she is scared.
Forgive her.
She is helpless at the hand of love
and then she is a girl,
she will think that way.
Even I am a woman,
I have the same emotions.
Do I not have the right to be jealous,
being misled or being scared?
What happened?
What are you thinking?
You don’t meet Roshni for a few days,
her mother is really inquisitive and
if she finds out the real thing,
then Roshni will be in trouble
and you can also land in trouble.
Hey…Najia, what are you doing?
Najia, what are you doing?
They will hear us downstairs.
Like always…
Stop crying. No.
stop crying,
you know mama,
how much will you cry?
Hey!
Your usual excuses have started,
that mama is not short tempered,
she gets upset on the outside.
Listen to me,
this anger on the top, hurts me on the inside.
I don’t care about her heart,
my problem is her thinking and her mind.
Okay. Okay. Calm down.
Hear me out calmly. Here, wait, sit.
Save your foot, sit here.
Najia,
is my love not a bandage on the wounds?
Huh?
Yeah, she wounds me and you put on bandage.
This will not work.
What do I do, Najia?
Should I fight with her?
No, I have no such hope,
and I don’t think you have
the courage to take a stand for me.
Najia, its not about courage.
I can go question her,
take a stand for you
but you don’t get it.
What do you think that
she will feel embarrassed and say sorry to you?
No, its not true.
Instead, she will have more
bitterness towards you in her heart,
she will feel you have instigated me against her.
I know my mother better than you.
I don’t understand her problem.
Have we been married for 8-10 years,
that the issue has got out of hand?
We have gone to a lot of doctors,
no one know what is wrong.
When all of them say everything is normal,
then what do I do?
Why does she always curse me
for not bearing a child?
Slowly. Okay, okay, stop.
I got such an expensive pot for you as a gift,
you broke it in your anger.
Umar, come here son.
Hello grandma.
Hello son,
come home early for a change some day,
you come so late we don’t get to meet.
I go to sleep.
There you go, when I didn’t used to work,
everyone had complains,
now that I am going, still you have complains.
There is a bride at home,
fall in love with her,
then you will come early.
Fareed was saying you guys go out for 2-4 days.
Look at this bride, she has started handling
the home as soon as she has come.
She can handle the kitchen all her life,
now is the time, go out.
Maheen likes staying home.
I know what she likes,
I will take her to the zoo.
Oh God,
the zoo is something you like as a child.
Now take her out,
take her to Murree or Swat, travel with her.
What is there in Murree, Swat?
People have littered so much.
Maheen get unwell with traveling.
I will take her to aunt’s home on the weekend,
I know she will get happy.
Okay, I am going, I am getting late.
Bye.
Yes, go. Go.
This child...
I have told you that
I am not coming to the roof to meet you.
Roshni, what is wrong with you?
The other day you had asked me
to come to the roof to meet you,
today I am asking you
and you are being stubborn.
Please, I am saying this for you.
I think your mother stops you from going out,
I am saying it cause of that.
I am scared that Maheen will get us caught.
I don’t trust Maheen at all.
What are you saying, man?
Why would Maheen do this to us?
In fact, she suggested this,
she cares for us,
she told us not to meet outside,
so that we don’t get caught.
Or get in trouble.
Oh, she showed her true color's,
she told you about herself.
She is doing all this so that
we cannot meet each other.
Roshni, please.
You are misunderstanding Maheen for no reason.
Yes, yes,
if she is this sincere and really cares for us,
then go and do one thing,
say what I tell you,
then I will see if she is like you think
or if she is what I think.
Roshni.
Umar, I am going, mama is calling.
Bye.
Who is it?
How are you feeling?
My fever has gone down,
I just have a headache.
Should I make you lunch?
No, you got tea in the morning,
you must have gotten insulted on that.
Not at all, nothing like that.
Aunt herself told me…
Leave it.
I have been living with her for a long time,
I know her, don’t try to pacify me.
Sister in law, she was angry at that time.
I hear all this from Mansoor often,
that she gets angry a lot,
she has nothing in her heart.
The day what is in her heart comes to her tongue,
I will believe you.
Okay you tell me,
should I make you soup or rice?
No, no need,
I am fine.
I will get up and make it myself
or else I will get insulted that her son comes tired
and he doesn’t get food.
This help of yours will be an issue for you,
you too go, or else she will take her anger on you.
She was saying with a lot of love,
that if you are going upstairs talk to her.
All the love is for you,
you gather her blessings,
her good words,
everyone doesn’t have a fate like you.
Right now she is getting her beloved
daughter in law do all the work,
she will prove that she is good,
she wants her to impress everyone.
This is my daughter, Roshni.
Roshni, say hello.
Hello.
Hello.
God bless. God bless.
Child, leave tea, come sit with me.
Come.
Your daughter is really pretty by the grace of God.
Child, what do you do?
She is silent, she doesn’t talk much.
She does work at home.
She doesn’t talk much,
that is good
or else you know girls of today,
they have 1 feet long tongues and
they don’t want to make a home.
Whatever it is, we really like your daughter,
and both of them are a good match too.
We are waiting for you to say yes.
She became shy.
You know she is the type to stay home.
Listen, Maheen,
come here.
Yeah?
The weather is good, let’s take some fresh air.
I feel cold.
Cold? In this weather?
Man, you even feel cold in hot weather.
God knows what will happen to you in winters.
You know when we used to go to
grandpa’s home for our winter vacations,
all of us would get inside one quilt
and then you would hear someone call out,
hot eggs, hot eggs,
Yes...
and you would make me get out of
that warm quilt to get you eggs to eat.
You were really cunning as a child,
you knew how to get your work done.
Not at all,
for that one boiled egg,
I used to do all your work,
day and night. Do you remember?
You want it?
No.
Listen, tomorrow is Saturday, I was thinking
we would go somewhere, lets plan something.
Huh?
Umar, I won’t stay overnight at mom’s.
Not mama’s home, something else.
Lets watch a movie.
Ask aunt.
Yes, that’s my job, I will do it.
Yeah…
Should we take Roshni along?
I thought you people have not met for a few days.
Even you two haven’t. met for a few days…
Yes,
you said we had to be careful.
With me being there,
no one will doubt us and
Roshni’s word will be proven true
that she came to meet me.
No. No.
Yeah, maybe.
I am feeling cold.
Don’t start the heater in the room.
Roshni was doubting Maheen for no reason,
now at least she will be at peace that
Maheen doesn’t want anything bad for us.
Mama, I am telling you right now,
I will not marry that Metric fail,
general store owner.
So what do we do?
Will a prince come for you from the sky?
The boy’s family and the boy both are good
and he also has his own car,
what more do you want?
Hey may have a lot but
he doesn’t have what I want.
That’s it,
I have had enough of your dramas.
I won’t listen to you.
I have given them my word.
Mama, I don’t get what is the haste,
investigate at least.
If I am such a burden,
drag me out of the house.
This nonsense will no longer work,
you have extended your
wedding discussion as you wanted,
now I will not hear you out.
Do you hear me?
I am your mother,
whatever I do, will be for your benefit.
I don’t know what the problem is?
I will have to do everything myself.
Roshni.
You have flu and then you go to the roof at night.
This is not the weather to go
to roam around under the open sky?
Ask Umar, he got our daughter ill.
Its not a flu,
I got a cold.
Child, what else is a flu, then?
Umar, come on son,
quickly go and get herbal tea.
In fact, I would say take her to the doctor,
before you go to work.
The cold of the end of the winter season
is really bad, it gets into your bones.
Yes.
She too roams around in a single shawl,
she doesn’t wear sweater or socks.
She will get a cold.
Yes, it’s the fashion of today that makes girls ill.
Grandma, the shawl was warm.
Child, one shawl would do nothing,
wear a cap. A cap.
Cap?
Yes.
Here you go, Maheen.
Herbal tea.
I got the medication now, have it.
I am having herbal tea, I will be fine.
You need anything else?
Will you fine till the evening?
We have a movie plan, that’s why.
If you are not well,
we will go some other day. It’s fine.
I will be ready.
I told papa, I will leave early from work.
fine.
if you need something, let me know.
Umar,
when you get movie tickets,
just get two.
I will shop till then.
Okay.
What happened Najia?
Do you have fever again?
Am I am kid that I will cry on having fever?
Then?
Did mama say something?
Yes.
What did she say now?
Have soup, have herbal tea,
take your medication,
should I boil eggs for you,
why didn’t you wear sweater?
Is this what she said?
What is there to cry in this?
Oh, so these are tears of happiness.
This is what I am crying about that
she said all this to Maheen and not me.
Like she is the one who falls ill
and I am nothing.
Man, why do you go downstairs?
Yes,
imprison me in these two rooms,
I don’t like going downstairs with
my damned face and increasing her BP.
If I don’t go, then she questions,
she doesn’t meet, she doesn’t say hello.
If I go, then seeing me,
she shows love to Maheen.
I ask, have I never fallen ill?
She has never showered love like this to me.
Okay, you come sit here.
Come. Come, please.
Okay,
I asked you, right?
I took an off from the office cause of you.
Okay, tell me, should I take you shopping.
No.
Can I take you to your mother’s?
Not at all.
If I go there, she will see me
and realize I am not happy,
and then her sarcasm,
see the result of a love marriage.
Okay, let’s go out somewhere.
Yes, I will take you for a movie.
Roshni.
Hey, Roshni.
Where did you go?
Roshni.
Roshni.
Where are you going?
I am going to watch a movie with Maheen.
What happened?
You have doubts again?
Come with me,
see for yourself that Maheen is with me.
I am not doubting it.
If her in-laws are so strict,
then why is she doing this
and giving them a reason?
They will say that the friend comes
and takes her to watch a movie,
that too hiding from the in-laws and husband.
We are not going secretly,
the husband will be with us.
Oh God,
when the husband will be there,
then why are you going?
What do you have to do between them?
Mama, her husband is also stubborn and egoistic,
he doesn’t talk properly to her.
So poor Maheen asks me to come along,
she will also enjoy it.
After all, her husband will go somewhere
else after the wedding, Maheen has to shop too.
Roshni,
whether he is stubborn or egoistic,
he is her husband,
she should compromise with the situation,
I don’t understand
why Maheen is dragging you in between.
If he minds, then?
Objection, one after the other.
The deal is that you doubt me,
that I take Maheen’s name
and go somewhere else.
Now the husband and
wife will pick me and drop me back,
will you be satisfied then?
If I tell you the right thing, you argue with me.
Neither you or Maheen have a brain,
after all, girls of today,
they have no brains, nor they listen.
Do what you want.
Hear one thing out clearly,
I will also pray a lot for your wedding.
I hope you get married soon,
so that I am at peace.
Move now.
Amen.
Bye.
Maheen,
why are you not ready yet?
You said you would come by 5, it’s just 3:30.
Well you don’t have to dress up that much.
Give this to me. Come on, give it.
I thought we have to pick Roshni
and if we are going
we will say hello to aunt Zakia, okay?
Here, done.
Come on.
Thank you.
You are being sarcastic?
I am thinking you.
Okay, go, hurry up.
Oh, who is calling?
Hello.
Yes, hello, how are you sister?
Yes, yes.
What?
No, nothing like that, I feel that…
listen to me.
Hey sister, I think there is some confusion.
Hello?
I don’t understand,
where all will this girl get me insulted.
