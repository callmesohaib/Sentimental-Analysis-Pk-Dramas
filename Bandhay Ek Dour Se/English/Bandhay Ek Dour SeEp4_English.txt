Man, Nabeel talks so nicely,
I didn’t even know how 2-3 days passed.
You know they have a huge house in Islamabad,
they are calling me to stay, I will surely go.
Roshni,
Umar came.
Okay.
Yes, and he was saying that
I really care for you.
Why?
What happened to me,
that you will care for me?
Nothing, he said he will talk to grandma,
grandma likes him and…
One minute,
I don’t trust Umar,
and I have seen your grandma’s worth,
have wasted enough time after Umar. Now,
I am seriously thinking about my future.
Roshni, can I ask you something?
No, I don’t have time,
I am a very busy girl.
Because I have to go home
and make tea for Nabeel.
Roshni…
Bye.
Roshni.
I have been shouting for 3 days that my
blood pressure medicine has ended,
but no one cares.
Now there is no
medicine in the packet.
What will I do all day long?
Oh, what happened to my son?
Come here.
Come to me.
Your mother must have scolded you,
she is always after you.
She always curses you.
Tell me.
Grandma, nothing.
If you were not there,
God knows what would
happen to me. Can I massage you?
I was thinking something that
lets go out, just you and me.
Yes, why not.
Do one thing, take me to the doctor.
I am asking about going out,
you are talking about the doctor.
Then,
lets go to the market,
I have to get a veil and stuff too.
Grandma, we will do it on our way back.
Lets do one thing,
lets go to aunt Zakia’s.
Hey,
you want to take me out or
make me go out of my mind?
I don’t want to go to her,
she has not asked me how
I have been since then.
She fought with Razia,
what is her mother in law’s fault?
She forgot her.
I care about you grandma,
I know you want to meet
Monis and Mahi. Right?
It’s the truth.
I really want to meet them,
but what can I do?
I have put a stone on my heart.
Anyway,
when Zakia has stopped us,
what can we do?
I will make sure I do everything for you,
I will get you a great bride.
Your mother has given me
all rights to find your bride.
This is even better.
Lets do one thing.
Lets do one thing,
go meet aunt Zakia and find a bride there.
What?
Now think, if we go to their locality,
aunt Zakia will get jealous.
This is the best way to make her jealous.
Damn it,
why would we go to her locality,
she only has weird girls there.
Not everyone.
I mean, there must be someone good.
We will find her and bring her here,
so that there is light in this home.
No brother, I won’t go that far.
I will look in my locality,
if I don’t find someone good here,
then we will go somewhere else.
I won’t go there.
Bring me tea.
I will.
Thank you.
Ouch. Ouch ouch.
You are going disappointed today too?
No,
at least she didn’t drag me out,
all will be well slowly.
Did you meet Roshni?
No,
not yet.
Umar,
what if its late?
It won’t be,
I told you it will soon be fine, slowly.
Mahi, I know she will wait for me,
I will have to think for her too.
I don’t want to meet her
and her mother finding out,
she will get defamed for no reason.
You know, because of my stupidity,
I can make mistakes.
I am being careful.
She is fine, right?
Yeah.
Tell her I miss her,
give her courage.
Tell her that Umar will
fulfill all his promises,
if God wills.
Hello.
What is your problem?
Has no one taught you manners?
Stop calling.
What happened?
Who is it?
I don’t know some damned man,
he has been calling for so long.
Why didn’t you tell me?
Or you should have told Monis,
we would have beaten him up.
Yes, I should have.
How did he get your number?
I don’t know, I give no one my number,
only close relatives.
Roshni took my phone,
I have been getting calls since
the phone came from her.
What do you want to say?
These calls are cause of Roshni?
I didn’t say that.
I only told you, cause you asked.
Or I would not know,
you two are the same, you take things
in different directions, go get married.
Tch.
Now you are getting upset and leaving.
Ludo in our home,
snooker in your home.
We have a shower
and you have a swimming pool.
Aunt Shahista was telling me
she works out at home to stay fit,
so you have a gym there.
You must have a huge home.
Its just that the two of us live alone there,
its not a big house,
a lot of rooms are empty,
in some mama made her gym,
I made my study in one.
I saw pictures,
there is a swimming pool too,
its really pretty.
Do one thing,
come and see for yourself.
Huh?
No, come home.
I want to come,
but my mama doesn’t let me go out.
All our relatives live here.
You have no relation with us?
If you want, I can talk to aunt.
Talk to mama?
Yeah,
to send you over for a few days.
Really?
I have one condition,
when you go there,
you will have to make coffee yourself.
You know,
going there,
I will miss you coffee the most.
You make awesome coffee.
Someone is outside.
Okay, I will open it.
I will go.
You sit here, I will open it.
Come on.
Hello.
Hi, I am Nabeel, and you?
Mahi.
Hey Maheen, my friend is here.
Do you want something?
You could have called?
I have something important to talk about.
What is your name?
Maheen.
You guys are like best friends, or what?
Yeah.
Roshni, I want to talk to you.
Yes, come along, we will talk.
I will be back in a minute.
It won’t take long, she is my friend,
I need to give her time. What is it, say?
Listen,
did you call someone on this number?
This person is calling me and disturbing
me again and again. Who is he?
Hey, I don’t know,
I took your phone once
and you are blaming me.
I am not blaming you,
since you took the phone,
he is really bothering me.
He messages often, calls.
I got a call in front of mama,
in front of Umar even. It looks bad.
Hey, its not my problem,
you see I am busy, can we not talk later?
Can we not talk about this either?
We will talk later please.
Roshni,…
Please, take good care, ok?
take care, and say hello to mama.
Hey, have coffee and go.
Bye.
I will give her coffee. Bye.
She is my friend.
Is she your neighbor?
Yes, neighbor, in fact, she asks for a lot of time,
cause she is a good friend,
so what were you saying?
Nothing, just like that.
I was thinking, lets go shopping.
We will have to take
permission from mama.
What is the problem in that?
I will take permission.
Fine,
lets go.
Okay, that is fine, make me tea.
Okay.
Yeah. Come my love.
Come. Come. Come.
Papa, hello.
Hello. You are home early today?
All okay?
You…
You must want money,
you are ashamed to ask your father.
That’s good.
Okay then, this shame is enough.
You know Umar…
no leave it.
You think I like insulting you for money?
It hurts me,
I want you to realize your responsibility.
You know what responsibility is?
Papa, what is wrong?
I want to talk about something else.
Actually,
I..i wanted that I…
if you can take me to work
with you from tomorrow. So…
What? When I used to say this to earlier, you told me,
that I didn’t do my masters,
some aspirations, etc, to go sell sprays,
I have some dreams,
where are they nowadays?
I have them right now too.
You know I am looking for a job for long,
I will do that,
I just don’t want to waste time.
I…
I have thought a lot,
I want that I stand on my own feet,
I have decided.
Wow, good.
You know
mama has so many dreams for me.
You…
I will do work and earn money and fulfill her wishes,
I want that mama stays happy.
Ahhh
Umar, are you ok?
do you have fever?
What is it papa.
Get him tea. Get him tea.
Sit.
Okay.
I will go get you tea.
Okay. Okay.
Tea for papa?
Stand on his own feet…
I am really tired today.
Really.
Do you want tea or water?
Just get water child.
Lemonade?
Get it. Get it.
Today, I met such old relatives that
I have not met in ages, is someone left?
No one is left. Its good you met them.
After all, these relatives have complaints
from those who live abroad,
they meet very little and then,
I have gone to my parents’ grave,
but some people are not in the world,
its good I met those who remain.
Yeah.
You met them with so much love,
but your poor relatives were jealous
it was evident in their face.
Water.
No lemons.
Mama.
Nothing like that,
everyone met me with love.
Only those met with love, who have daughters,
cause they thought you
were looking for a bride for your son.
Huh?
Yeah, that is possible,
but you know my son has selected his bride,
and what my son likes, I like.
God bless, who is that lucky girl?
When we bring the proposal,
we will tell them.
What is it?
What took you so long,
I was waiting for you for so long.
What is it? I thought you called me
cause Umar wanted you to.
He will not come,
he told you he will come with a
proposal this time, then see,
he is head strong,
he is not even messaging you,
he told me to tell you that its
his first day at work tomorrow.
He got  job?
No,
right now he will work with uncle,
he will work.
You mean, he will kill pests,
become a doctor for plants?
Roshni,
you don’t want to talk to him,
don’t want to meet him till the wedding is fixed.
I get that, after all,
girls should be careful,
but you are upset with him,
you are angry.
I am not angry with him,
I am angry at myself.
Roshni.
Hey, Roshni.
I am going, guests are over,
I need to give them time.
Wow Roshni,
since they came,
you are giving them time,
you have not given me any time.
You have met me after so long.
What guests are these?
They came after ages and
now they don’t want to go?
Hey, what is your problem?
Are they bothering you?
They are really dear to you,
you are not giving your friend time,
you forgot about your love.
You think, I am mad. I am not mad,
you cannot fool me,
I know the wrong calls
I am getting on my phone,
those are cause of you. If I tell Umar,
you will see what he will do to you.
What did you say?
Are you threatening me?
You are scaring me with
Umar’s name?
what if those wrong calls are cause of
and now that you are getting married,
you are blaming me for it.
You want to prove that you are innocent,
that will not happen.
Roshni, you think so negative.
Go, I don’t want to talk to you.
Yes, I am not dying to talk to you.
You will tell Umar!
You are leaving in the morning?
Yes, its been so long,
we came for 3-4 days and stayed longer,
so we will have to go back.
I feel you came today and leaving tomorrow,
stay for 2 more days please.
I would have stayed but there
is a lot of work when I go back,
I need to set the office, I need to set the home,
so I got mama here first
so that she doesn’t complain.
So you will never come back?
When did I say that?
You will get busy, that is why.
I will, but you can come,
you are not busy.
Who will bring me from here?
We will do something,
that aunt sends you to us herself.
If you want, I can talk to mama.
Really?
Yes,
I will come to get you myself.
Fine,
do you need help in packing.
No, I am good, I will do it.
Can I get coffee?
I will make it.
Okay Zubeda, I am going,
you have to come to me for a long time.
I will come when
I get done with work at home.
Then send Roshni,
this way she will see our home.
Its my daughter,
I have not done anything like this before,
and then it’s a different city.
Aunty, why do you worry?
I will come pick her up here,
I will visit here often for business
and by the way Roshni,
I will really miss your coffee.
Fine, then for your
coffee we will take Roshni.
Lets go, we are getting late.
Okay, come on.
Do come, okay.
Bye.
I will take it.
What is wrong with you?
Cheer up, I am coming to get you.
You really care about your clothes,
that is where you will sit.
Its dirty.
You go do some rest.
Adjust
Well done.
I had to get her a gift,
this is from my first earning.
Did you tell her?
She was really happy to 
know that you are doing it.
hahahah
You didn’t mind?
No,
I don’t mind anything you say.
I felt one thing though.
What?
I felt that she thinks that 
I am passing my time with her,
fake love, its not true, 
you know how much I love her.
If someone doubts my love, 
it hurts me.
I want to make her 
believe that I really love her.
Really, a lot.
Umar,
I fear that it will get late…
No, it wont be late,
I am mama and papa’s favorite nowadays, 
and also grandma’s beloved.
I will get grandma to do everything.
Just tell her to care 
for grandma on your wedding,
then you will see the magic.
Did you sit with mama?
Sit with her, talk to her, 
she is upset, she will feel better.
She is upset on something and 
take the anger out of me,
I am used to it, I will do it.
Mahi,
one minute.
What is this?
Roshni.
We met finally.
Oh God, its tough Roshni,
and her mother is there too.
Hello aunty,
I forgot something with Monis, 
so I was honking the horn.
Are you ok?
I made a mistake.
Till today nothing happened
cause of me that his payment got delayed
and he had to call to inform me.
When I had given you the money, 
why didn’t it reach them?
I am asking you something Umar.
Papa I will drop the money 
by tomorrow morning.
Fine,
this shouldn’t happen again.
The name is utmost importance 
in business child.
Yes.
Get it?
Umer.
Yes.
You have the money, right?
No…
Where did you spend the money?
Papa…actually,
I had to get something for me,
so I forgot that this was not my money, 
I had it in my pocket, so I spent it.
Look child, it was 
not that big some of money,
it was just 25 thousand, I had to 
give it as fees for getting electricity work.
Its not about the money, 
its about responsibility.
Understand?
Yes, it wont happen again.
Fine.
I felt you would scold him a lot.
Yes, I would have scolded him if
he had not spoken the truth
or said he dropped the money.
He told me clearly,
he spoke the truth,
now I will scold my young son 
for 25 thousand.
Young son?
He spent 25 thousand,
but came home empty handed,
this is something more worrisome.
Look, who has come?
Look, who sent this.
Nabeel and aunt Shahista.
When they came earlier, 
they came empty handed,
what is the point of sending this now?
Mama, its my birthday.
But Roshni, how did Shahista 
know it was your birthday?
Mama, Nabeel asked me once specially
when it was my birthday. 
See he remembered.
Great, show me, what all is there?
Give it. Give it all.
I want to see it too.
Maheen.
You are back.
Yes, happy birthday.
Thank you, I was waiting for you.
Come inside,
leave this, I want to show you this,
this perfume, this watch, these flowers, 
Nabeel sent it all for me.
Nabeel?
Nabeel, aunt Shahista’s son, my cousin.
First he surprised me in the morning, 
called me exactly at 12.
He wished me and didn’t tell me 
he was sending me gifts.
Roshni,
you have stopped Umar from 
calling you and messaging you,
you will get defamed. 
Then this Nabeel called you at 12.
Why mention Umar?
He is a stranger for my family.
If I get caught talking to Umar at night, 
my mama will beat me up.
All these gifts, 
these came in front of mama.
What happened?
Okay listen,
if you talk to Nabeel, instead of Umar at night,
would they object or not?  
They will, cause he is a stranger.
Yes,
Nabeel is a stranger for me,
but how did Umar 
become a stranger for you,
I didn’t even know.
Leave it man,
tell me, how expensive is this watch?
10 thousand? 20 thousand?
And this perfume, I used to look 
away cause it was so expensive.
What is in your hand?
errr…
I was going to the 
market to get this changed,
your home came on the way.
Tie the strap please.
I look good? I look rich?
You seem that way?
You will open it right now?
Yes.
Come downstairs,
come on, the cat will catch you.
What happened Mahi? 
I was waiting for your call.
Yes,
sorry,
I was busy with work at 
home and forgot to call.
Meaning, when its my job, 
you got busy. You forgot.
It was a small thing,
I just said deliver the gift and 
let me talk to her from your phone.
She told me not to call, 
she doesn’t have an issue with you calling.
Umar,
whether you do it this way 
or that way, it’s the same.
When she said no to talk to you, 
then you know what that means.
Yes, but I wanted to wish her 
on her birthday. Try and understand.
You promised not to call right, 
she didn’t.
if she wants, she can call you.
She is a little stubborn.
Anyway, if she is not stubborn with me, 
who would she be stubborn with.
Tell me, how did she like the gift?
Speak up.
That…mama was unwell, 
so I couldn’t give her the gift.
Here you go!
I gave you one small task, 
you couldn’t do that.
Sorry, I will give the gift.
Promise.
Umar, don’t get upset.
Hey stay at home on the holiday, 
you are ready to leave again.
I have just one off day, 
I have a 1000 things to do.
Go madam, do you work,
I don’t want you to sit with me,
I am talking about Mansoor,
he should spend time 
with us on the off day,
Mama, why…
Hello aunt!
Hello sister in law, how are you?
Me? I am like this.
If you don’t miss your train, 
go make me cup of tea before you go.
Sure.
Come.
Where is grandma?
Where would grandma be?
I have to sit alone on a holiday,
my son is taken away by his wife, 
and the husband with his mother,
God knows what shrine they want to.
Najia, get tea quickly.
Why tea in such hot weather.
Headaches don’t care about hot or cold weather.
I will have tea, I will feel better.
Najia, just get one cup of tea, 
Monis is feeling hot.
Okay, Monis, tell me more, 
how is aunt?
Mama is fine nowadays.
Yes, she only gets other unwell.
No, I get that, but you hear me child.
Hello.
Oh no, he is saying, 
he is coming to get you.
What? Such a good news.
Mama, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. 
I will tell you that I will go for sure.
Are you mad?
How do I let you go with a single man alone?
What alone travel.
He will take me on the plane, 
it won’t be empty, there will be people.
Aunt Shahista is calling me 
and I don’t go anywhere.
Please.
Be quiet and sit, you have never stayed 
with your uncle and aunt, but you will go here.
Tell me something,
there is no girl your age in Shahista’s 
home, what would you do there?
Oh mama, I don’t get it what 
girls have smart mothers.
Don’t you get it? Aunt 
Shahista is being nice to me,
why is she calling me there, and 
how many times she told you she likes me.
Okay, so this is the deal.
Then it will look even worse living there like this.
Mama, they are modern people,
they don’t care about such things.
She wants that before marriage,
I see the environment of their home, 
them. Its good for me.
That is fine,
but if they send the proposal properly, 
it would have been good.
Mama,
they will send the proposal,
you first give me the permission.
I feel you gave me permission,
I am going to go pack, 
you too come quick.
Roshni!
