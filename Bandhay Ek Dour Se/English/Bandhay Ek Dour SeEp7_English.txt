Nabeel, I will talk to them tomorrow.
But mama,
please be careful of one thing you
will not be pressurized by uncle.
You will have the final decision.
what is wrong son,
your happiness is my happiness,
I will make the decision you want.
Hey, when will your mother come?
I have been calling her for so long.
I spoke to her, but…
But what?
If she was here,
I would talk to her in detail.
She wants that you go to her yourself and..
No I stayed there for so long, I met all relatives,
I cannot go there again.
why do you have a
long face on everything,
if you want, I can talk to aunty.
you will talk to her?
Its my decision, I will talk.
she knows us for so long,
I don’t think she will say no.
It’s true we are distant relatives,
but it’s the same family.
but mama, I feel you
should ask what Roshni thinks,
it’s important for her to decide too.
What objection can she have.
Roshni, you will live with us, right?
trust me, I don’t have an issue if you
want to continue your education.
If you want to go to an academy or
home tuition I can arrange that.
Hey no, I spoke to Zubaida,
she doesn’t want to study,
so she didn’t study beyond Fsc.
mama, I feel girls should complete
their education, right?
Yes,
I was thinking to tell Zubaida to stop
worrying about her wedding,
we will find a good proposal
and marry her here.
what is wrong?
Did you break something?
Nothing madam,
I am cleaning up.
what happened?
The long face again.
Okay, we will not marry
you without asking you.
Fine, we will not fix your wedding
without asking you. Mama, you worried her.
fine, I won’t talk about it. I was just saying
that I will talk to Zubeda that we took your responsibility,
we will also fulfill the
responsibility of your wedding.
Her burden will be reduced.
We are not from the people who get money
and forget their old relatives,
I am always trying
to help people out.
I am going downstairs,
you sit here calmly.
what is wrong Monis, sit please.
Okay, promise, I won’t say anything,
you sit I will come soon.
Come fast.
Yes.
Oh my child,
what sort of fate does she have.
Did she regain consciousness?
Yes, she is conscious.
Why do you curse your daughter's fate.
We are here,
we will find a solution.
if you cannot see me with love,
see me with anger.
Hey Zeeshan,
when did you come?
Tell me,
were you standing outside?
Yes brother Umar.
Did something come to the neighbor’s home?
A car, taxi, rickshaw?
No, I didn’t see anything.
What do you see?
Brother Umar, it’s an assignment,
I need to submit it tomorrow.
Yes, move, I want to lie down here.
Assignment? Walk?
come on move.
We came number one cause of you.
The weather is nice
Its nice, for you.
Brother Umar, you look worried.
No, nothing.
Just worried for
Maheen but all will be fine.
Yes, I saw too, the Maheen incident.
You know I have a
solution for worries.
what is that?
Nothing.
Show it to me.
Its nothing.
Give it.
Brother Umar, it’s nothing.
I will tell your mother,
she will beat you up.
I swear its nothing.
Give it to me.
Will you get up or not?
Get out of here.
Get out.
Give this to me.
Brother Umar,
you spoil the mood. Man, damn it.
You shut up.
Weird people.
oh God. My head hurts,
give me a tablet.
one minute, let me check,
I should have it in my purse.
Here.
just gave her medication
and put her to sleep.
In fact, the doctor gave
her a sedative injection.
Everyone is worried for this.
I feel we will be up all night.
Can I say something?
Yeah.
Both their prayers
have a strong affect.
See how it got answered.
I don’t know if it was a
prayer or a curse.
What? Curse?
Yeah, did you not see Umar?
He was so relaxed like
he knew this wedding won’t happen.
God knows what magic he got done.
Magic?
Who are you talking about?
Umar, why do you act so lost?
Who else will try that this
wedding doesn’t happen?
Umar?
Such cheap people.
Mama,
I had told you not be hasty,
but you wanted to get rid of Mahi,
like a burden on your head.
Son, don’t blame your mother,
what will that do?
What mother wants bad for her daughter,
she must have thought some good.
But the actions for the past 2 months should
have made it easier to understand.
I told her to break the engagement.
How could I break it?
The girl whose engagement is broken never gets married,
people take out faults in her.
Talk about her.
Zakia, what about the
threat they gave us?
What if they don’t show up tomorrow?
Hadn’t the engagement being broken been better?
what are you saying brother?
Monis, you leave in the morning,
sell this home,
put it as guarantee and get the car.
I won’t do anything like this.
Monis.
Mama, it’s not that I am giving
the home importance over Mahi,
I can give my life for her.
Knowing their reality,
I don’t want my daughter
to go to those greedy people.
So before they say
no to bringing the groom,
you call them and say no uncle.
What nonsense, Monis
Today, when you talk about
putting the home at risk,
and fulfill their wish, but when they make
more wishes again, you will have nothing.
A greedy person is always greedy.
Exactly, grandma.
What will they do my sister,
I can guess it.
I cannot push my sister
in the well knowingly.
Uncle, you call.
Don’t be hasty Monis.
Let’s find a solution.
what solution?
Are you in favor of agreeing
to their unjust demand.
we will find a middle ground.
What middle ground?
Monis is smarter than you.
My child, my orphan child.
She is to be married tomorrow.
How do I tell them not to come?
Who will we make believe that my
daughter doesn’t have an issue.
The girl whose wedding is called off,
how will she get another proposal.
What will we tell people?
People will say a lot,
I don’t have the
courage to hear them.
I don’t understand
where I am standing.
I agree with Monis,
but my mind takes Zakia's side.
In either case the girl will suffer.
there is another way.
Umar.
Umar?
Mama, what will Umar do?
what is wrong mama?
What would Umar
know of this situation?
leave it,
he will give weird suggestions
You people don’t get it,
those people are not worth giving
our daughter to them. Monis is right.
They didn’t care for our respect,
they left at the wedding time,
God knows what they
will do when they come again.
Mama…
Fine, I heard you
and you are right,
your own people cover you.
Mourad is not there,
I am alive.
My Farid will put his
hand on Maheen's head.
why do we go to strangers
to marry my daughter.
Farid, call them and
ask them not to come.
As far as the guests,
they can come and be part of
Umar and Maheen's wedding.
mama,
are you in your senses?
How did you take
Umar’s name just like that.
This is not possible.
You remember, right?
That you gave Umar's right to me,
will you go against your word?
why don’t you say something?
We are talking about one thing and
mama is taking it to another direction. Is it a joke.
Razia mama is not wrong and I think
there is no better solution of this problem.
solution for the problem?
Hey my son is a living being,
you cant sacrifice him like this.
I am telling you this cannot happen.
Razia, listen.
Listen to me.
Farid, I am telling you this isnt possible.
So don’t argue with me
and go and talk to your mother.
I won’t let this happen
so she should get quiet cause if
I speak her greatness will be shattered.
you are stuck on it
cause my mother said it.
What wrong did she say?
Think calmly,
what does Mahi lack.
You always said that Mahi filled the
space of the daughter you never had.
Yes,
I consider her my daughter
but not my daughter in law.
I have thought of things for my son,
I have some hopes,
how can I marry him to someone
cause a third person asked me to.
I get him married quickly.
not a third person,
his father and grandma decided this.
The other thing, your wishes are not
more important than someone's respect.
As far as marrying
him quickly is concerned,
that will happen,
you can fulfill all your wishes.
Thank you so much
for giving me permission
but I still won’t agree.
Mama,
Maheen really loves you,
you please agree.
You stay away,
you are giving me suggestions.
Mama, I am your son,
Umar's brother, listen to me.
I listen to Umar's brother,
his father, his grandma,
why? Should I not listen to Umar?
When you had to get married
you cared about no one and did what you wanted.
What do you want now?
Umar gets killed without knowing,
does no one care
about what Umar wants?
Oh yes, I forgot about that.
Umar's agreeing to it matters,
it’s a matter of his life.
Yes, what do you want,
is he an animal you can tie
him where you want?
Hey, go wake him up,
a storm has broken loose
here and he is sleeping.
Papa, don’t need to ask him.
why not?
Only your husband had
the right to get married by his will.
why don’t you say something?
Now is the time to talk about it.
I am, wait.
I am telling her Najia.
Papa, mama,
Najia is right,
don’t ask Umar.
Umar, already…
Razia will never agree.
I don’t care,
its Umar's grandma's decision,
she dare change it.
Then my son is with me.
Grandma,
I don’t know why
I don’t like all this.
I mean, I love Mahi,
but forcing someone
to marry her forcefully,
no I cannot tire my sister like that.
Stop it you,
her mother and grandma are alive,
don’t you dare interfere.
What's forceful in this?
Call Umar and ask him right now,
he will agree.
I know him well.
That is why I said it.
Did he ever consider you and
Zakia separate from him?
Will he be selfish right now?
Will he hurt Maheen?
Come on speak up,
why don’t you speak?
This is his wish
and both families had a feud,
he couldn’t say it,
he was not worth it,
but his heart's wish
is to be fulfilled now.
Thank God
I was thinking that
I was going to do good with my
niece and do wrong with my son.
Thank God.
my son,
he shared his sorrows and secrets
with someone who just came in.
did he want to get beaten by telling you.
the decision is done and there is the
call for prayers, now no one will say anything
and you too expand your heart,
the daughter in law is not as per your will
but someone you like.
Mahi is just like the daughter you wanted.
Let’s prepare for the wedding tomorrow,
mansoor you help Umar prepare.
Papa, can I give Umar this good news?
Yes,
you are the only one in the world
who can give him the good news.
She won’t say a word after Umar agrees.
She had issues in your wedding too,
but didn’t do anything.
Hello.
Hello mama.
Roshni,
I just woke up and saw 3 missed calls
from you in the night. All ok?
nothing is ok mama.
What happened?
Nabeel and Shahista are good, right?
Not good, they are not good at all.
Roshni, you are worrying me,
tell me what happened?
You were so happy yesterday.
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything when
I get home.
The first bus or train I get,
I am coming back in it.
what? What are you saying?
You will travel alone in the bus.
You have any idea how long a bus takes.
Mama,
whether the journey is long or short,
it will be painful,
but I need to come back.
I am putting down the phone. Bye.
Hello…
God have mercy,
God knows what happened.
Umar.
Umar,
get up. It’s late.
Let me sleep,
the light is so bright.
What is the issue?
Aunt has kept a morning meeting
like a villager, get to work now.
No, you are safe,
no one will make you work.
Today is your day, in fact,
we are here to work for you.
what is it?
Why are you being sarcastic
in the morning. Let me sleep.
because today the day
is important for you.
why is important?
What happened?
What are you looking over there for?
nothing.
Okay, get up. Shave,
get up with me,
I will get you a haircut.
Did you get good clothes or
that old jeans is all that you have?
what is wrong brother?
Why are you all of a sudden worried
about my shave, my haircut, my clothes?
You are getting married today.
I am your elder brother,
if I don’t worry, who should?
My brother should look like a prince.
I will look like a prince.
It’s not my wedding.
On my wedding
I will look better than a prince.
Hey, idiot.
It’s your wedding,
you will be married soon.
Is this a joke?
I am not joking, it’s the reality.
Come on, we are getting late. Come.
grandma are you telling the truth?
Yes, what else?
He agrees?
yes, he agrees. With all his heart.
He says no to anyone
and he agrees to me.
He likes Maheen too.
Since childhood
he liked his aunt's home
and now his fate
also got him here.
thank God aunt.
You know I had a burden on my heart,
it’s been moved.
Maheen is dear to me,
Umar is like my brother,
my friend.
I didn’t want him to be forced.
Grandma..
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Live long. Live long.
Let me go pray.
The guests are the same,
why inform them again,
don’t waste time,
they will know when they come.
Take care of the rest.
No, I wanted to say that Najia's family,
don’t forget them, invite them. After all,
it’s her brother in laws marriage.
do you see the time?
A person looks at the situation and time,
we have the wedding and reception the same day
and you are always caring for your in laws.
I have guests too, Umar has friends,
we have neighbors, should we call them all?
You surprise me. Hey, my son is up.
Come on get ready quickly.
one minute papa, what is all this?
Me and Maheen?
Hey son, come. Come.
The decision was already made by God,
we got a go ahead right now.
I was worried yesterday,
I thought what would happen.
But trust me all
His decisions are the best.
But no one asked me.
Let us ask you now.
What will you wear on the wedding?
You must have gotten your jeans
You think this is a joke?
Calm down. Talk slowly, Monis said
we shouldn’t force you in Mahi's matter,
they won’t like it if they hear this.
No one cares what
I will like or dislike,
I could have a plan,
I could have something in my head.
He is right papa,
let’s call the orchestra.
Hey, don’t bother him,
we will do it all.
Give way.
There is no time right now,
you can fulfill all your wishes once the wedding happens.
You fulfill your plans. Come on take care of him.
Come on man, look, there is still time,
come shopping with me,
get a sherwani or suit or what you like.
Be quiet man,
sherwani suit.
It’s a one sided decision and that too hasty.
I will talk to mama
Useless dramas for no reason.
Razia,
I will never forget this favor of yours.
zakia, what are you doing?
if it was possible, I would put
my heart under your feet.
I was going to throw my daughter in the well.
Had you not supported us,
we would have suffered all our life.
You put a hand on her head and saved us.
You are marrying him to your diamond like son.
Umar
may God give you happiness
and give you a long life.
You have always
made me happy Umar,
I didn’t know the biggest happiness
of my life will come from you.
First I was happy that I am going
to fulfill my daughter's duty,
and now,
I am satisfied I will see my
daughter happy all my life.
Live long.
Live long.
Live long.
Mama.
Umar, be quiet now.
Yes my heart was not convinced,
yes I thought I wouldn’t stay quiet like
I did in case of Mansoor,
but I don’t have a stone heart.
Fine,
my relation with Zakia is not as
good as two sisters have,
she is my sister in law,
but she is Maheen's mother,
how can I not understand a
mother’s sorrow being a mother.
All of you see aunt Zakia's sorrow,
everyone is thinking of Mahi,
everyone wants to do good.
Someone think about me too.
Umar,
half my courage was gone,
with me hearing what you wished for.
But if I didn’t agree,
this would have happened.
You think your mother is hurt,
yes I was hurt,
but seeing Zakia's tears
and the prayers you get,
I thought even if I got a girl I liked,
you wouldn’t get these prayers.
How would your father be at peace?
So what is happening is good.
May you two always be happy.
Now agree to God's will.
Maheen,
Maheen.
Your fever is not going down,
no medication is working.
Get up.
Get up.
I feel dizzy sister in law.
yes, must be cause of
the fever or medication.
Come on get up, have breakfast,
then you need to go the parlor.
parlor.
won’t you go to the parlor?
Won’t you be a bride?
Bride?
What?
Last night they left,
did the issue get sorted?
Yes all is sorted, in fact it’s great.
Is mama getting them a car?
Has she put the home on the line?
Sister in law, say no. Say no to them.
To hell with those people.
Their useless wishes.
The reason  you got fever,
that is fine.
Get up and get ready,
then see the surprise God has for you.
If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise.
You can see for yourself.
Come on get up.
I have given you a glimpse of happiness
and your fever has gone down.
Once you get complete happiness, you will fly.
Come on, get up and get ready.
Should I get you breakfast?
If it’s a matter of Mahi's life,
it’s a matter of my life too.
Marrying her if a lot of
people are getting happiness,
me and Roshni are getting sad.
And then I can face this sorrow,
how do I shock Roshni?
Mahi, where is Mahi,
I want to talk to her
about something important.
Okay, Mahi is at the parlor to get ready
and whatever important things
you have say them together.
Ok? Go now.
Yes uncle, you are our elder.
It was not possible without consulting you
but the situation was such.
Yes, I know.
Razia..
Yes, she is Murad's last sign,
an orphan and then someone as
obedient as Umar has made us happy.
Thank God.
Here you go.
what is this?
for you.
Mama, but…
Razia, you have made me happy,
you accepted my decision.
Okay, so in this haste,
I got this sherwani, it’s really good.
wow.
Its fine, right?
