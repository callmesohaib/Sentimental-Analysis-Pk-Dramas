I am really upset with sister Maheen,
she doesn’t want to live in her home and
she didn’t even let my home be settled.
Look Fazeela, I respect your emotions,
but right now, the mental stress and
torture my sister is going through,
you cannot even imagine.
All of this are your sister’s actions.
Roshni?
I cannot expect anything from someone
as cunning as Roshni.
But your sister,
at least she should have stopped,
once we got married,
she would have gotten her
husband married again.
All this is not that easy for Maheen.
If you were in her place…
God forbid if I were in her place.
Still if I was in her place,
I wouldn’t have done something so stupid.
Sister Maheen has decided that
she will ruin her own life,
she will stay alone,
but she wants to do this with all of us,
she is ruining the happiness of everyone.
And this Roshni?
I will not leave this Roshni,
I am telling you!
After all, what is left to be done?
One decision of Maheen,
has tied her brother’s hands
and if you look at it,
I feel Maheen is more responsible,
than Roshni.
Monis, we are not talking about
who is to blame and who not.
Right now we are talking about
that my life is ruined.
We are not getting married, Monis.
One wedding is not happening,
the other is getting ruined.
Its all the fault of this wedding,
the wedding has ruined everything!
What? Really?
They agreed?
Or else I was going to tell you a scheme
with which they would agree.
Its good it wasn’t needed.
What happened?
Are you not happy?
No.
Don’t I look happy?
I am happy.
Obviously, man.
So then tell me,
what date are we fixing?
Because my mother is in a hurry,
because Maheen’s mother created a scene.
So mama is worried that
the people in the locality will find out.
She is right.
I think my family will come over
to your home in a day or two.
By the will of God.
Fine.
That.
We will just have a simple wedding.
Why?
Its your second wedding,
its my first wedding.
I will have some wishes.
I know. I understand,
but see the situation
we will just get married.
Okay, leave it.
After all, you will be with me,
so each day will be a celebration.
Let these people do what they want.
There is something else.
What happened now?
Papa agreed to the wedding, but
he has said that
I can get married, but
I cannot leave Maheen.
Why can’t you leave her?
What do you mean?
Lower your voice, everyone is listening.
He has put a condition.
Did you agree to this condition?
Roshni, papa has listened to so much I said,
but this is not in my control,
its his decision.
Roshni.
Roshni, what happened?
I say leave my hand.
Lower your voice, it’s a public place, 
everyone is looking.
What are you doing?
Okay, man.
Okay, sorry. Sit here.
Sit and hear me out completely.
Sit, please.
I have done all that you said,
but Mansoor I am scared that
if the result turn out to be what you
 told me to, then what will happen.
By the will of God,
I don’t have hope, I have full confidence.
But God forbid,
I fear that I in the matter of Maheen,
I am not just answerable to God,
I am also answerable to my brother,
God bless him.
If God forbid it doesn’t
 happen as we want it,
then you get Maheen freed
 from this nameless relation.
We will fulfil her responsibilities
 being a brother, being a father.
But I have full hope from God 
that we will not reach this point.
By the will of God.
By the will of God.
I swear to God Roshni,
 there was no other way.
Do you have no other way or
 you don’t want to leave Maheen.
When is Maheen with me?
You leave the one that is with you,
she is not with me.
Yes, then explain this to your parents,
have they gone mad?
They are my parents,
how are you talking about them.
A person shouldn’t be so naïve,
to get them to agree to one thing, 
you agreed to ten things they said.
You know its so easy to 
emotionally blackmail parents.
Lower your voice.
How much more do
 I emotionally blackmail papa?
I just got married and 
he agreed to my second marriage,
who agrees so soon?
Tell me.
What do I do now?
What idiot asks for so much permission?
Are you a scared, coward girl 
who is so influenced by their parents,
even I won’t be 
so influenced by my parents.
I feel Maheen has some motive behind this.
What motive will she have?
What would interest her?
What would she get by living with me,
 when you live in my heart.
She will sit in a corner of the house 
and waste her life,
and at max what will she do?
Care for my old parents, that is it.
Roshni, everything gets fine with time.
You came back early today.
Yes.
Did you give Roshni the good news?
Yes, I gave her the good news.
She must have been really happy.
Yes, she is happy.
But lesser than you.
What motive will she have? 
What would interest her?
What would she get by living with me, 
when you live in my heart.
She will sit in a corner of the house 
and waste her life,
and at max what will she do?
Care for my old parents, that is it.
Its good she will be one side,
at least I will not have 
the responsibilities of Umar’s parents,
Maheen will handle her,
 after all she is their beloved.
I will tell Umar clearly
that if his parents want to keep her close, 
then they should limit her to them.
I will spend a year with them,
we will see what happens after that later.
Grandma you have not prayed for me so long,
you didn’t blow any prayers on me, either.
You pray for your own,
who are we to you?
Will you people always stay 
upset with me like this?
Why do you care?
What you want is happening.
You were upset on your wedding,
now go,
Dance, get on a horse,
become a groom.
I don’t know grandma, 
I feel that something is not complete.
I need your prayer,
you pray for me, that’s it.
All of you think that I am really happy,
but that is not true.
There is a weird restlessness,
I am restless,
I feel suffocated.
I feel suffocated, it feels weird.
Look Umar,
you are not bad at heart,
those who are bad at heart,
they don’t care for others in their happiness, 
that they are upset or sad.
But you are not happy on the inside 
because others are upset,
others are sad.
Don’t do this my son.
Don’t do it.
You will stay worried all your life,
 you will feel suffocated all your life.
I don’t know grandma,
there is restlessness on both ends,
it’s a weird feeling on both sides.
I think that
if Roshni does something wrong
 because of me, then?
If she gets defamed because of me,
will I ever be able to forgive myself,
will I ever be able to stay happy all my life.
What more will she do wrong?
But her parents are there to care for her,
she has her beloved.
We have to care for our Maheen.
Go.
You go.
You go to Roshni. Go.
Grandma pray for me.
Will you leave or not?
Go. Get lost.
Umar, she went for a few days,
did you see your condition?
You say that you have not accepted her 
as your wife with your heart,
but you couldn’t tolerate her leaving you.
This is what has upset you,
that how did she think of separating from you.
Think when Maheen told you that 
she won’t live with you at any cost,
and she dislikes you,
then why did you feel so hurt?
And when she is not stopping you
 from becoming someone else’s
then why are you so disappointed?
Why do you want that she stops you?
What do you want her to say?
Think Umar.
Think.
I heard your voice and I got scared.
You were really worried?
Roshni, I don’t know 
I wanted to be with you.
I am with you,
where do I have to go?
Its just that I got upset on
 something you said yesterday.
What can I do now?
I cannot stay upset with you for long
and Umar,
I realize your worries and tensions.
Thank you Roshni.
Umar, I am doing so much for you,
so I want that you do something in return.
Living with Maheen in that 
room will be really difficult for me.
Roshni,
I don’t have any other option
and then Maheen will not 
be an issue for you and me.
And your parents,
who hate me.
After the marriage you won’t be 
there twenty four hours to protect me.
I don’t know 
what I will have to go through.
Not at all.
There is nothing like 
what you are thinking.
This will happen.
I cannot face this torture day and night.
I don’t want to face so much.
Umar,
you will have to make arrangements for this.
Roshni, I…
I have not thought about this, 
nor can I do something
and then in this condition,
mama and papa are still not well.
They will not get well.
I mean that
you see their age, they are old
and these ailments will continue this doesn’t mean 
that I stay in torture all day long.
They show love to Maheen,
and I get upset all the time.
I don’t want this life.
Is this how you will repay me 
for my patience and courage?
But Roshni, one thing is decided
that I cannot leave mama and papa.
Fine,
don’t leave them,
but we don’t need to get involved 
with them and live.
Your brother also lives 
with them in that home,
in a separate portion,
we will do the same.
The beloved daughter in law they are happy with,
they should live with her.
Its your decision, right?
Then go yourself.
To talk about these matters,
you need a woman.
Mama, Razia is unwell, you come along.
I will not go.
Why don’t you people understand?
I am not doing all this by my own will.
Razia, mama,
we are in that time of our lives where we can explain 
what is good and bad to the children,
we cannot force them.
If he didn’t understand, 
I am supporting him in my helplessness.
What helplessness?
I am more upset on you than him.
Hey, he is doing what he is, 
but you don’t stay on the front line.
And you shouldn’t involve us either.
That’s it. 
Yes.
You know if he takes this extreme measure.
The son will go away from us, Razia!
I have tried to save this house, 
so that he doesn’t rebel or hate us.
This way he will stay with us at least,
he will realize this in his heart 
that even with a heavy heart,
we accepted whatever he said.
What did we agree to?
He made us agree to it.
I will also make him agree.
He will agree by the will of God.
What is there to agree to?
There is something.
There is no point in 
telling you people the detail,
you get emotional on everything.
Hear me out,
we have to go with
 the proposal in a day or two and…
We don’t have to go.
Roshni, I don’t think I am able to 
make you understand properly.
You...
You know that in the top 
portion brother Mansoor lives,
there are only two rooms there,
and he has them both,
sister in law and brother Mansoor.
So how can we live there?
And then sister in law’s temperament is such…
Who is living with your sister in law, Najia.
Throw them out,
Get that portion empty,
we will live there.
This is not possible Roshni.
You try and understand Umar,
you handle your father’s business,
he is bed ridden now,
he will only pray now.
Understand your position.
You can make them agree
 to anything you say to,
pressurize them.
Tell them that if they don’t empty that portion,
then you will leave the home.
What is wrong in that?
When they see the business sinking, 
they will all agree.
When you are not able to get food to eat, 
everyone will come to their senses.
The one who is earning, running the home,
what he wants should happen.
Our elders have done a lot of favors on us,
those that I wouldn’t have 
been able to pay all my life,
but now,
God has given me a chance to 
respond to that love somehow.
After all what better can I get than living 
under the shadow of uncle and aunt’s love?
Okay, then fine,
I will come along with you,
I will ask for the proposal later,
I will insult her first.
For God’s sake mama.
Mama,
then I will come along,
her mother should be treated too.
You people forgive me,
I will go alone.
I thought that a woman of the home would
 come along it would have been easier,
but your intentions…
Uncle,
I will come with you.
Damn it!
Umar, what happened? 
You called me in such an emergency.
Umar?
Brother Mansoor, I have found
 the answers to all the questions.
The question that you put in my heart.
I have found out.
What have you found out?
That I am not entangled in Roshni’s love,
but in the promises I made,
I don’t have fear of going away from her,
I am afraid of the blame of being 
called unfaithful and a cheat.
I don’t wish to live with her,
but I care for her.
I feel that I made a promise to her,
if I go away from her, she will take her life.
I don’t love her.
This is not love.
This is just a burden,
that suffocates me.
Who do you love?
Did you find the answer to this?
The answer is in front of me,
I kept on looking away,
I used to feel ashamed.
I claimed to love a girl,
made her wait for me,
then I fell in love with someone else.
But brother Mansoor, 
I cannot take it anymore,
I want to get rid of this burden.
Umar, I was waiting for this moment,
go and tell Maheen
that you have learned 
the difference between illusion and love.
How can I tell Maheen?
What will she think about me?
She knows everything about me and Roshni.
She knows my madness.
She will think that the things
 I used to say to Roshni,
I am saying to her.
How will she believe me?
Umar, you have wasted a lot of time, 
in these ifs and buts.
These useless misconceptions,
don’t waste time in those,
go and tell her.
Should I?
Yes, right now, this very moment.
And Roshni?
Its clear to you who you love,
then also decide that
 who do you care about the most?
The one you decide about do think about it,
that the one you care about, is she worth it.
Roshni is not worth this.
She is not worth it.
I agree that her emotion is real, 
she must love me,
but the people I love,
who are attached to me,
if she cannot love them, 
then I cannot add her to my life.
Then go.
Go right now to Maheen and tell her.
Take out the fear from inside you.
Go.
Thank you brother Mansoor.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What happened, papa?
Is everything ok at home?
Mama.
What happened to you?
Why are you crying?
Someone tell me, what happened?
We have fixed the proposal
 and also the wedding date.
After four days you 
and Roshni will get married.
What?
So soon?
You also fixed the wedding date?
What sort of people are they? 
They couldn’t tell us before coming.
You knew when those people are coming,
you should have stayed at home,
but you cannot stay at home.
They are weird,
they didn’t even meet me 
and nothing else,
and my mother is the most weird,
that is so tired of me that
she met them for the first time, 
and fixed the date of the wedding.
They must not want to meet you.
The way we are getting this
wedding done with a dead heart,
they must be doing so as well.
And you leave everything,
you are happy,
your wish is complete.
Now what do you want?
Should we dance over this defamation?
Mama, there was no need to be so hasty.
You failed all my planning.
Right now I had to get 
Umar agree to so much,
make him agree to a lot of my conditions.
Now how will I pressurize him
 after the marriage?
Roshni,
I don’t see any signs of you 
wanting to live in that home.
Look,
you have fallen in love,
take your respect and leave.
If this is how you will behave,
you will come sit on this door.
See this,
come to your senses.
