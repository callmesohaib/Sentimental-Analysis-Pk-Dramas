[00:28] I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
[00:32] To get a husband or in other words,
[00:37] to get a man,
[00:41] a person can pass any limit.
[00:47] to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
[00:52] for me, other things matter too,
[00:55] like relations,
[00:58] faithfulness,
[00:59] trust,
[01:01] and friendship.
[01:03] And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
[01:12] Umar is not just my husband,
[01:15] he is also my childhood friend,
[01:18] my partner since childhood
[01:21] and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
[01:29] You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
[01:33] You lied to him,
[01:35] and that poor thing,
[01:38] he didn’t lie, you did.
[01:41] He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
[01:49] I am back,
[01:52] but not to get Umar,
[01:57] but to save him.
[02:17] Oh God, what will I reply to his questions?
[02:22] I didn’t even think of an excuse,
[02:25] how was I to know…
[02:42] You now prepare to go home.
[02:46] Thank God.
[02:49] Here.
[02:51] Mama is at home to give you company,
[02:54] she cannot have this diet food alone.
[02:58] Now you will have diet food
and she will too.
[03:04] Its fine, right?
[03:05] Yes.
[03:07] Did Maheen make it?
[03:13] I don’t know.
[03:15] That’s fine.
[03:17] You go and do your work,
Mansoor is here,
[03:21] when you come back,
we will go home together.
[03:28] Okay.
[03:30] Thank you.
[03:37] I have been asking you for so long,
[03:39] let me shampoo your hair, brush it,
[03:42] I finally had to force you.
[03:45] You leave it, I will do it myself.
[03:47] Not at all,
[03:49] you will sit here peacefully,
[03:52] I will make your hair, then uncle will come.
[03:55] after that I have to go help out sister in law too.
[03:59] I feel really bad,
[04:02] that after Najia gave me such a big good news,
[04:06] instead of me caring for her,
[04:09] taking care of her wishes,
[04:11] I am on the bed myself,
[04:16] but these days you have really cared for Najia.
[04:20] Now I am thinking,
[04:24] when you leave, we will be in a tough spot.
[04:27] So don’t make us get used to your comfort.
[04:31] This…
[04:33] I am not going.
[04:36] I am not going anywhere.
[04:54] How are you?
[04:56] I will talk to you later.
[04:57] Bye. Bye.
[04:58] I am coming home.
[05:01] Fine. Fine.
[05:03] Yes Monis, come you can meet papa.
[05:11] Oh,
[05:14] no,
[05:17] I didn’t come here to see how you care for me,
[05:19] in fact, I will make tea for you and myself…
[05:21] No, no, leave it. Keep sitting.
[05:23] Even the doctor didn’t instruct me to sit so much.
[05:26] What do you want?
I sit here and do nothing.
[05:29] You  have to see mama too.
[05:31] Yes, so I just have to see her,
[05:33] what else do I have to do,
[05:34] we have a maid,
there is a washing machine,
[05:36] the home is cleaned,
[05:37] I just have to take care of the kitchen
and that is not much work,
[05:39] that is no work, if I don’t do that even,
then what is the benefit of me being here?
[05:42] You only came here to benefit us?
[05:44] No, there is another reason.
[05:47] Umar?
[05:51] I was going to the kitchen to make tea
and you got me talking here.
[05:54] Maheen,
[06:00] everything was fine between you and Umar,
[06:04] at least it seemed ok.
[06:13] Sister in law, just think I was being stupid,
[06:19] I was going to get a big loss,
[06:23] I listened to people and…
[06:27] now I am back.
[06:29] To fix everything and
[06:32] by the will of God it will all be fine.
[06:34] God willing.
[06:57] Yes Monis,
[06:58] tell me what is the important
thing you want to talk about?
[07:00] I want to talk but
[07:02] I wanted that we sit in front of each other
and talk face to face,
[07:06] it will be nice.
[07:07] Actually, I have to be somewhere,
there is something important.
[07:13] I think those days were more important 
where the new relation was not formed.
[07:18] We were friends,
[07:19] brothers too,
[07:21] we didn’t have this formality between us.
[07:25] The new relation changes everything, no?
[07:30] Nothing like that Monis, actually papa…
[07:35] Fine, I will meet you.
Tell me, where do you want me to come?
[08:08] Get two cups of tea my friend.
[08:18] Look man,
[08:20] I should have talked about this to Maheen.
[08:23] One minute.
[08:25] One minute, man.
[08:30] How did you call me here?
[08:32] Talking to old friendship.
[08:35] Now you are talking about Maheen,
you are trying to make me realize
[08:38] and you are telling me
the type of relation we are in?
[08:42] Thank you, man.
[08:45] Okay,
[08:46] think that,
[08:49] here,
[08:51] I didn’t call you to talk about your wife,
[08:56] but my sister.
[08:59] Okay?
[09:01] Look, I have never forced her before today
that she comes back
[09:08] and nor have I pressurized you,
[09:10] and I don’t even know
who was at fault from between you two.
[09:16] Now I get it,
[09:19] what you have come to talk to me about.
[09:20] Hey, man, I am not talking about this.
[09:22] Then?
[09:27] I wanted to talk about Roshni.
[09:38] Roshni, tell me the complete thing.
[09:40] Tell me what happened?
[09:44] Open the door.
[09:47] Roshni.
[09:55] Come here.
[09:57] Hey, hey, what are you doing?
[09:58] Sit here.
[10:00] What happened?
[10:01] What was the need to go tell all those things?
[10:04] You have  any idea,
you got me insulted badly.
[10:07] How was I to know?
[10:09] I thought she was your best friend,
[10:11] you must have told her
something from the start.
[10:13] Mama,
[10:14] I am not interested in ridiculing 
myself in front of the world.
[10:18] That is why I don’t tell her everything.
[10:20] You have this habit of taking me lightly.
[10:23] Oh God,
[10:24] you are shouting like,
all hell has broken loose.
[10:27] Fine, I made a mistake,
[10:28] I ask for forgiveness,
[10:30] I will not even think of this even
when I am alone.
[10:32] Where this thing had to reach,
it has reached.
[10:39] Meaning?
[10:40] Even if Maheen has found out about you,
then, what is wrong in that?
[10:45] She is your best friend.
[10:46] What is respect and
disrespect between friends?
[10:48] She will not tell anyone.
[10:49] You just forget it.
[10:51] Why won’t she tell anyone anything?
[10:55] She will first go and tell Umar.
[10:57] Mama, you have ruined
my well planned out game.
[11:05] What well planned out game?
[11:07] And what is Umar?
[11:09] You tell me,
[11:10] no matter what happens in your life,
[11:12] who is Umar?
[11:14] Roshni,
[11:16] what are you hiding from me?
[11:17] tell me.
[11:18] Why are you mentioning
Umar again and again.
[11:20] Mama, you go from here,
[11:22] you leave me alone, go from here.
[11:24] Roshni.
[11:24] Go!
[11:58] Roshni?
[12:00] Yes,
[12:01] she went to your home today
[12:06] and I don’t like this.
[12:14] She must have gone to meet Maheen,
[12:18] so what?
[12:20] This is what I don’t want.
[12:23] Look Umar,
[12:24] because of this Roshni’s stupidity,
[12:27] both families had bitterness.
[12:30] You two were upset with each other, right?
[12:33] Its possible you two must have
had an argument on something.
[12:38] Maybe this issue would
have been sorted before time,
[12:42] had Roshni not added fuel to the fire.
[12:44] There wouldn’t have been
so many complaints.
[12:51] What?
[12:51] I don’t get it, what did Roshni do?
[12:57] So, Maheen told you nothing till now?
[13:06] Umar,
[13:08] Maheen didn’t say
all those things to mama,
[13:13] the weird complaints about you,
uncle and aunt.
[13:18] Roshni did that.
[13:21] Mama thought that Maheen must have been
reducing the burden on her heart,
[13:24] so as soon as aunt came in front,
[13:27] she complained.
[13:30] Then things got out of hand.
[13:33] Maheen fought a lot with
mama on saying all these things,
[13:37] especially when nothing like this happened.
[13:40] That’s when we found out.
[13:43] Maheen said nothing like this?
[13:45] No,
[13:46] in fact, she fought with mama,
[13:48] she got upset.
[13:49] She was swearing that
those people care for me so much,
[13:53] they love me a lot.
[13:59] So,
[14:02] I was just thinking that
[14:06] Roshni doesn’t meet Maheen again.
[14:11] I don’t know why she did this.
[14:17] So I am just afraid
that she might do this again.
[14:21] So instead of me talking to Maheen,
its better that
[14:24] you tell her clearly that
there is no need to meet Roshni again,
[14:30] or meet less.
[14:33] This is best for you two.
[14:36] Okay?
[14:39] Okay.
[14:57] Najia.
[14:59] Najia.
[15:01] Papa is home.
[15:03] Hello papa.
[15:05] How are you now papa?
[15:07] Hello papa.
[15:09] Medicines?
[15:10] Yes, they are in the car, I will get them.
[15:12] Till then I will drop papa to the bedroom.
Fine.
[15:15] Come on, there is work in the kitchen.
[15:23] I am happy that you are home,
[15:28] but I am sad that
I am not capable of caring for you.
[15:33] That’s it.
We have cared enough for each other.
[15:39] Its time for the kids now,
they will care for us now.
[15:43] Why not papa? Surely.
[15:45] He will do that when he gets
time caring for his wife, then.
[15:51] Congratulations papa, mama is fine.
[15:56] I was thinking mama lost her
memory after the accident,
[16:00] she must have forgotten that
I am a mother in law.
[16:03] Here, she remembers that
I am a hen pecked husband.
[16:06] Stop it son, stop it.
[16:10] Okay,
[16:12] Mansoor,
[16:14] I asked you for some work of Umar,
did you talk to him?
[16:20] I will talk in a day or two.
[16:23] About what?
[16:25] Hey, leave it.
[16:26] That reminds me papa,
[16:28] what were you singing in the happiness
of mama regaining her memory.
[16:32] Talking is…
[16:33] Yes, what is Razia?
[16:37] Talking for me is….
[16:39] Mr. Mehdi Hasan Khan.
[16:42] Let me try.
[16:45] It wasn’t this difficult for me to talk earlier.
[16:58] Wow.
[16:59] Just like now…
[17:01] Just like my gathering is now,
[17:07] it wasn’t like this earlier.
[17:10] Yes,
[17:12] just like your gathering is right now,
[17:15] it was not before.
[17:37] Umar, Maheen didn’t
say all those things to mama,
[17:41] the weird complaints about you,
uncle and aunt.
[17:46] Roshni did that.
[17:48] Mama thought that Maheen must have been
reducing the burden on her heart,
[17:52] so as soon as aunt came in front,
[17:55] she complained.
[17:57] Then things got out of hand.
[18:01] Maheen fought a lot with mama
on saying all these things,
[18:04] especially when nothing like this happened.
[18:07] That’s when we found out.
[18:10] Maheen said nothing like this?
[18:12] No,
[18:14] in fact, she fought with mama,
she got upset.
[18:16] She was swearing that
those people care for me so much,
[18:20] they love me a lot.
[19:37] Hey stop it, Maheen.
[19:40] I cannot digest anything lying on the bed and
you feed me after every thirty minutes.
[19:48] Uncle, tell her,
[19:49] till she doesn’t eat,
[19:51] how will she regain health
and how will she get fine.
[19:53] You go without worrying, you rest.
[19:56] I will see her, go.
[19:58] I am not going anywhere,
[19:59] since I have come,
I am sleeping here with aunt.
[20:03] Hey child, your uncle is back, he is here.
[20:06] You go sleep in your room, come on.
[20:09] Now the duty is double now,
[20:11] I have to care for you and uncle too.
[20:13] I am sleeping here on the sofa.
[20:15] No, Maheen, what are you doing?
No, Maheen, child…
[20:18] I will go change and come.
[20:23] Stay happy child, stay happy.
[20:34] Maheen.
[20:42] Sit here.
[20:59] I want to talk to you about something,
[21:01] I want to say something.
[21:05] I also want to talk to you.
[21:11] I don’t know if you will believe me or not.
[21:16] I don’t know if you will believe me or not.
[21:22] When your belief is so weak,
should you talk?
[21:30] I think, yes.
[21:32] If saying it has chances of loss,
[21:36] then not saying it will bring
a much bigger chance of loss.
[21:41] So say it.
[21:44] I shouldn’t have gotten angry with you.
[21:50] Not at all.
[21:54] And when I realized
that my anger is baseless,
[22:01] I felt really embarrassed.
[22:07] Really really embarrassed.
[22:13] Maheen, will you forgive me?
[22:20] Anger for what?
[22:26] Maheen, when you left from here,
I was really surprised.
[22:33] I thought Maheen left
all of a sudden like this,
[22:36] how?
[22:40] I got really worried.
[22:43] I felt that everyone in the home will blame me,
what will I say to everyone?
[22:47] What will I tell them?
[22:50] To be honest,
I didn’t feel angry at all.
[22:54] I thought it was your
right to think about yourself,
[22:57] decide for yourself.
[23:01] Honestly,
[23:03] this was your right,
[23:06] but when I found out that you,
[23:10] you said all this about mama and papa…
[23:15] Umar,
[23:16] I did not….
[23:16] One minute Maheen, let me say it.
One minute.
[23:19] If you had told everyone that
Umar is with someone even after marriage
[23:28] or even this truth of yours
wouldn’t have hurt me,
[23:32] had you set you don’t like
being together with me,
[23:36] that was fine too.
[23:39] But saying something about mama
and papa and things like these,
[23:48] after that I was completely broken.
[23:50] But Maheen, then I found out that
[23:54] you didn’t say any of this.
[24:02] I swear to God I am so embarrassed,
[24:06] I don’t have words.
[24:10] How did I even think, that my Maheen,
[24:13] my childhood friend,
[24:15] my best friend,
will say this about my parents,
[24:18] or about me, how did I even believe it?
[24:23] I mean…
[24:29] that is what I am embarrassed about.
[24:31] really embarrassed.
[24:37] The way Maheen has cared for us,
[24:40] if we had our own daughter,
she wouldn’t even be able to do it.
[24:46] This means you have
cleaned your heart from her.
[24:55] After so much love and care,
[24:58] even a stone melts,
[25:01] I am still human.
[25:07] You know,
[25:10] there is one thing Fareed,
[25:16] after so many days have passed,
[25:20] Maheen hasn’t mentioned why she went
[25:24] and what her fight with Umar was for.
[25:29] She didn’t even justify her lie,
[25:37] nor did she apologize for it.
[25:40] What better way for apologizing
than her coming back,
[25:50] she realized it,
[25:52] she made a mistake.
[25:56] What do you think,
[26:00] do you only apologize with your tongue?
[26:05] But,
[26:10] did you note something Razia,
[26:20] that is everything normal
between Umar and Maheen?
[26:32] You have asked this question,
[26:36] so even after thinking too hard,
[26:41] I don’t remember whether the two of them
have even talked to each other even.
[26:53] Oh God,
[26:56] my doubt was right.
[27:01] What doubt?
[27:06] She didn’t come back
ending her anger with Umar,
[27:19] she came back to her blood relatives,
[27:24] maybe for sympathy.
[27:29] But Umar doesn’t have either of
the two reasons to come back to Maheen.
[27:37] You know Razia,
[27:38] whenever I have mentioned
Maheen in front of Umar,
[27:50] I have seen a weird fear on his face.
[27:52] Always.
[27:53] Leave it,
[27:54] what are you thinking right now,
they are kids.
[27:57] Everything will be fine with time.
[28:01] Time doesn’t pass,
[28:04] it leaps forward.
[28:09] What is the point of realizing this later,
[28:12] when you spend so many years
in deprivation and compromise?
[28:20] What is the point of the realization then?
[28:28] Razia,
[28:34] we mistreated our children a lot.
[28:41] We have really mistreated them.
[29:09] Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
[29:12] You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
[29:20] So you know this is Roshni’s action
[29:23] Obviously I know, man.
[29:25] I am so stupid, so idiotic,
[29:29] how did I believe that you said all this.
[29:33] My Maheen cannot do this?
[29:35] You cannot hurt anyone,
[29:37] nor cheat anyone, never.
[29:40] I know this.
[29:42] And most importantly,
[29:46] you can never stain our friendship,
[29:50] not today, nor tomorrow.
[29:54] Friendship?
[30:07] Yes, friendship.
[30:17] So, you know why Roshni said all this?
[30:24] Yes,
[30:26] I know it really well.
[30:29] I know you and her well.
[30:32] You are my friend,
[30:34] and she is my love.
[30:37] You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
[30:41] She is really stupid.
[30:44] You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
[30:50] Poor thing,
[30:53] she is also living up to her love
[30:56] and friendship with you too.
[30:58] She did all this for your ease,
[31:01] when she realized that
[31:04] you won’t be able to say anything in any way,
[31:06] so she said it,
[31:08] for your ease.
[31:09] Think about it.
[31:12] For my ease?
[31:15] Yes,
[31:17] now she is not even answering her phone.
[31:19] I have been trying her phone for so long.
[31:22] Since she found out
that you have come back,
[31:25] since then.
[31:26] She wants to get out from between us,
so that we stay happy.
[31:31] She is so stupid.
[31:35] She loves me after all,
[31:38] she is trying to live up to it.
[31:45] This is a weird situation.
[31:54] What happened?
[31:57] You didn’t get it?
[32:00] Maheen?
[32:08] Aunt is waiting for me.
[34:16] Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
[34:20] You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
[34:28] So you know this is Roshni’s action?
[34:31] Obviously I know, man.
[34:33] I am so stupid, so idiotic,
[34:37] how did I believe that you said all this.
[34:40] My Maheen cannot do this?
[34:43] You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
[34:48] I know this.
[34:50] And most importantly,
[34:54] you can never stain our friendship,
[34:58] not today, nor tomorrow.
[35:07] I know you and her well.
[35:09] You are my friend,
[35:11] and she is my love.
[35:14] You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
[35:19] She is really stupid.
[35:22] You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
[35:28] Poor thing,
[35:30] she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
[35:37] She did all this for your ease,
[35:40] when she realized that
[35:42] you won’t be able
to say anything in any way,
[35:45] so she said it,
[35:47] for your ease.
[35:48] Think about it.
