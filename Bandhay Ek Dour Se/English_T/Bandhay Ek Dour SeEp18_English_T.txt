[00:21] I will go but whenever I go to aunt’s
I come back with a heavy heart.
[00:30] There is no one to care for her in her illness.
[00:34] She has become really alone after uncle.
[00:37] Yes,
[00:39] and then God didn’t give her a child even.
[00:43] Oh God. My poor sister,
[00:46] all her life she lived a tough life.
[00:50] She got insulted for not having
a child from her in laws and then
[00:55] the husband often threatened her
of second marriage
[01:01] and now she is lonely.
[01:06] What happened?
[01:08] Nothing,
[01:10] just thought of sister in law.
[01:13] Poor thing.
[01:15] At least brother Mansoor is good,
[01:19] he doesn’t curse her or give her threats
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
[01:26] That’s it, it’s fine.
[01:28] No,
[01:31] aunt I didn’t mean that.
[01:34] Aunt it’s my habit,
[01:36] I say things without thinking.
[01:39] Please don’t mind, I didn’t mean that.
[01:43] The massage is done.
[01:45] No…
[01:48] aunt I wasn’t even thinking this.
[01:53] Mad.
[01:55] Mama is right, I am dumb.
[01:58] I don’t know how long she will stay upset for.
[02:12] What did you say to Maheen
that she is ready to do all this.
[02:17] I didn’t say anything,
[02:19] she was saying big dialogues.
[02:21] I am generous,
[02:23] I am a sacrificial Godess,
[02:25] she even said that you can keep Umar,
[02:29] it doesn’t matter to her.
[02:32] She said that?
[02:33] Wl yes, so?
[02:35] When a married woman tells another woman
that she has no relation with her husband,
[02:41] what does that mean?
[02:43] It means one thing.
[02:44] That is what I am trying to tell you Roshni,
[02:48] both of us have no such feelings between us,
[02:51] that married couples have.
[02:52] What girl would say that?
[02:54] See, she is telling me that I accept you,
[02:57] marry you.
[02:59] Not just marriage,
[03:01] she is giving you two options.
[03:03] Either marry me, or leave me.
[03:08] She knows well that
you won’t go for the first option,
[03:12] so what is the second option?
[03:14] To leave me.
[03:17] Its not like that Roshni,
she must have said this with full sincerity.
[03:22] Then why don’t you do one thing,
[03:24] worship her sincerity.
[03:27] Cause you don’t care or need my love.
[03:31] You are happy with generosity.
[03:35] No Roshni, what can be a bigger need than love.
[03:40] You don’t compare yourself to
Maheen again and again,
[03:44] it hurts.
[03:46] It hurts me too,
[03:48] because I am far behind in conception with her.
[03:52] Tell me, will you marry me?
[03:54] No right?
[03:56] Then accept her second condition and leave me?
[03:59] She didn’t put a condition, she gave a suggestion,
[04:01] I have the right to decide.
[04:04] I will decide on my own.
[04:07] Roshni, I will marry you,
[04:10] I will talk to my family.
[04:12] But not right now,
[04:16] after a while.
[04:16] Okay, and after that?
[04:21] What after that?
[04:22] will your family agree?
[04:25] Maheen is your uncle’s daughter,
[04:28] the whole family will turn against you.
[04:31] What will you do? Leave home?
[04:35] Okay,
[04:36] for a second, let’s believe you leave home,
[04:40] but after that?
[04:42] where will you take me?
[04:44] You don’t have a job,
[04:47] you handle your father’s business
[04:49] and he will not give the whole business to
you out of this happiness and my mother,
[04:54] why would she marry me to you?
[04:56] A man who is already married,
[04:59] and doesn’t even have a job?
[05:01] What do I do, Roshni?
[05:04] Right now I cannot suddenly convince them,
[05:08] I can only talk.
[05:09] Yes, you will talk and then forget for sure.
[05:12] Look,
[05:15] it will be fin,
[05:17] when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
[05:20] and accept that they made a mistake
[05:23] and they themselves say that Umar,
[05:26] marry where you want to.
[05:29] It will work then.
[05:32] Roshni, what cannot happen,
[05:34] Maheen wants that,
you are saying the same thing.
[05:40] A lot can happen if your goddess
of sacrifice is really willing to sacrifice.
[06:14] My poor sister,
[06:16] all her life she lived a tough life.
[06:19] She got insulted for not having
 a child from her in laws and then
[06:24] the husband often threatened 
her of second marriage
[06:29] At least brother Mansoor is good,
[06:33] he doesn’t curse her or give her threats 
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
[07:16] Where is mama?
[07:18] She went to elder aunt’s home,
[07:20] she is unwell.
[07:27] Why do you have a long face?
[07:32] I have always had a long face.
[07:36] Yes, I know you have a long face, 
but today, its longer than normal.
[07:41] You too have a long face all the time, 
have I ever asked you the reason?
[07:47] Ask,
[08:01] Listen Maheen,
[08:03] what you said last night,
[08:05] I thought hard about it.
[08:09] Its really difficult,
[08:11] in fact, impossible
[08:14] and I am not afraid of papa scolding me,
[08:18] nor mama’s slaps or curses,
[08:22] I will face that.
[08:26] But all this is not possible,
there is no benefit in it.
[08:32] The battle I can’t win,
[08:34] why should I fight it.
[08:44] I am talking to you.
[08:53] I shouldn’t have spoken to aunt like this,
[08:56] she thinks I was sarcastic towards her. 
How can I be sarcastic?
[08:59] I swear to God Umar,
[09:00] I didn’t think something like that and
 it slipped my tongue and she disliked it so much,
[09:04] she is unwell and her heart is dirty towards me.
[09:10] This is why you are worried?
[09:11] Yes.
[09:13] Okay, you do one thing,
[09:16] when you talk to her,
 tell her that I was really embarrassed.
[09:24] I am.
[09:31] Curse your birth Roshni,
[09:34] you have not left me capable 
to show my face anywhere.
[09:37] You got me insulted in the community.
[09:41] Mama,
[09:43] what did I do? What is my fault in this?
[09:46] All this happened with me,
[09:48] you should be sympathetic towards me.
[09:50] Why should I be sympathetic?
[09:51] About what should I be sympathetic?
[09:53] Did you told me earlier?
[09:55] You should have told me all this earlier,
[09:58] I would have at least gone and slapped Shahista
[10:01] about how she even thought of making you a servant.
[10:04] Hey, they have some money out of illegal means, 
she will consider her relatives small.
[10:10] You know, what the real issue is?
[10:11] You are shameless.
[10:12] You suffered through all this,
 how did you go through this insult.
[10:16] Now I don’t understand 
what those people will think about us,
[10:20] how we have stayed quiet.
[10:22] Mama, had I told you all this, 
I would have been the one that got insulted.
[10:27] Hey, you should have told me something,
[10:30] at least I wouldn’t have been sarcastic towards
 his son getting married somewhere else.
[10:34] I would said it myself
[10:36] that you were disillusioned
[10:38] that they were taking you not to make you 
their daughter in law, but servant.
[10:42] God knows what she will be telling everyone.
[10:53] Mama.
[10:57] Mama,
[10:59] you don’t realize 
how I went through all this, how I felt?
[11:07] You know, only out of the fear 
that I don’t hurt you,
[11:12] I suffered this sorrow alone.
[11:15] I used to hide and cry at night,
[11:18] so that you don’t cry.
[11:20] Instead of being sympathetic towards me, 
you are getting upset with me.
[11:49] You know,
[11:52] a little money has removed
 the shame from Shahista’s eyes.
[11:57] What was the need for you to
 make a mansion out of dreams,
[12:01] you thought yourself…
[12:04] okay stop it.
[12:06] leave it,
[12:07] what had to happen, happened.
[12:11] Come here to me.
[12:15] Be quiet.
[12:17] May God ask these mother and son.
[12:20] Yeah.
[12:34] You really care for your mother today.
[12:38] I always care for you.
[12:42] You were telling me about aunt, how is she?
[12:46] Yes, she is better.
[12:49] The sorrow of loneliness is the biggest on her,
[12:53] its eating sister alive.
[12:55] You are right.
[12:58] It will be fun,
[13:00] when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
and they accept they made a mistake.
[13:08] Maheen misbehaved with you?
[13:11] Huh?
[13:12] How dare she?
[13:14] So much courage to misbehave with my mother?
[13:17] I would have fixed her right there,
[13:20] but papa is there,
[13:23] she is papa’s beloved,
[13:25] he would have scolded me 
instead so I said nothing,
[13:28] but you don’t have to care for her,
[13:30] you need to scold her 
or she will get on your head.
[13:32] Get lost,
[13:33] Get up from here. Bloody conspirator.
[13:35] What is wrong mama?
[13:36] You sat with your grandma since childhood, 
this is what you had to learn.
[13:41] Instigating people.
[13:42] Hey, I am saying it for you.
[13:43] Get lost from here, 
or else I will hit you with my slipper!
[13:46] Have you no shame doing 
this cunningness and back biting.
[13:48] Hey, does this cunningness suit a man.
[13:51] Hey, there is no point in 
being good in these times.
[13:54] Hey careful.
[13:58] Now I get it why he was so passionate 
about caring for his mother.
[14:36] You have been lying here since last night?
[14:39] Why do you care?
[14:42] Why are you angry?
[14:44] Why do you care?
[14:49] Did you fight with Roshni?
[14:51] Why do you care?
[14:55] Yeah,
[14:56] why do I care.
[14:58] Listen,
[15:03] what did you say to mama?
[15:07] Why do you care?
[15:11] Okay, sorry.
[15:14] About what?
[15:16] I won’t tell you that.
[15:20] Listen,
[15:22] should I take you to aunt today, it’s a holiday.
[15:30] No, not cause of that, I swear.
[15:34] I will drop you and leave from outside.
[15:37] Tell me.
[15:42] We will go together.
[15:44] I will go ask aunt.
[16:03] Mama, do you have a complain?
[16:06] What have you people thought?
[16:09] Will you take a step or not?
[16:15] Regarding what?
[16:17] God also helps those who make a move.
[16:21] Whatever you get is from God, 
but a person needs to do something.
[16:28] The time is passing and 
this task will get difficult.
[16:31] After all, there is an age to have 
a child and bringing it up.
[16:36] Will you two realize after you turn 40?
[16:39] I knew it,
[16:41] mama wanted to say this
[16:43] and wanted to say it with us sitting in front of her.
[16:45] Hey…
[16:45] Najia, sit here,
[16:47] and you will not move till I complete.
[16:50] Hear me clearly.
[16:53] I went to elder aunt tomorrow
[16:55] and I couldn’t see her condition,
[16:58] everyone gets old and gets unwell,
[17:01] but may God not give anyone 
the sorrow of loneliness.
[17:05] I know well,
[17:06] that her mother in law used 
to go after holy water,
[17:10] and these religious scholars.
[17:13] If sister was treated on time,
[17:16] God would have given her a child,
[17:19] but no.
[17:20] now science has progressed so much, 
there are great doctors,
[17:25] why don’t you people get yourself treated?
[17:27] What do you think?
[17:29] That we didn’t go to doctors?
[17:32] Mama,
[17:33] Najia,
[17:34] I mean got her tests done from 2-3 places,
[17:39] her reports are normal, there is no issue.
[17:44] And you?
[17:50] Did you get your tests done?
[18:43] What?
[18:44] What do you mean mama?
[18:45] What are you saying?
[18:50] Your papa always said that brother Ghulam Rasool,
[18:54] who has been threatening sister
 for years about a second marriage,
[18:58] why doesn’t he get married again?
[19:01] It was only cause if they don’t have 
a child from the second wife either,
[19:05] everything would become clear.
[19:06] That he has the issue not sister.
[19:10] Now God knows what the reality is,
[19:12] when God kept the secret of the one who died, 
then why should we look into it.
[19:16] But Mansoor,
[19:18] I don’t want that people have 
the same opinion about you,
[19:22] so son, get your tests done as soon as possible.
[19:33] Yes.
[19:36] Najia,
[19:37] even your mother must wish to see you bear a child,
[19:42] this is something natural.
[19:44] If this doesn’t upset you, 
then don’t get upset when I say it.
[19:51] Child, I want to see you happy,
[19:54] and settled, that is it.
[20:23] If I had not seen you, 
then you were dropping her and going back.
[20:29] You yourself said you don’t like meeting here.
[20:32] Aww,
[20:34] you listen to so much I say,
[20:36] you are so good.
[20:39] You brought her here stuck to each other,
[20:41] how were you two sitting on the bike,
 stuck to each other.
[20:44] How else do you sit on the bike?
[20:49] It’s a holiday,
[20:51] everyone wants to go out,
[20:54] the car was not there, so I came on the bike.
[20:58] Ok, please leave these complaints,
[21:01] I am already worried.
[21:03] What happened now?
[21:06] What you said is going on in my head,
[21:09] that she is making 
a place in the heart of the family
[21:11] and when it will be time for me to demand something, 
everyone will take her side.
[21:17] Last night I found the opportunity, 
regarding Maheen….
[21:22] What?
[21:24] What did you do? Tell me.
[21:26] Why are you not talking? Speak up!
[21:28] Calm down Roshni, what is wrong?
[21:30] I am telling you.
[21:31] I am listening, you speak up.
[21:33] I was talking to mama about her, 
I bad mouthed her in front of her,
[21:35] and she scolded me.
[21:37] She said, what, why, 
why am I acting like a woman?
[21:42] Thank God.
[21:44] I thought God knows what happened.
[21:50] Monis.
[21:52] Monis.
[21:53] Yes. Yes.
[21:54] Come here.
[21:55] Yes mama.
[21:56] Call them, I am fixing food.
[21:59] What is she doing upstairs since then?
[22:01] Roshni came, 
she took her to the roof and sat there.
[22:04] It feels like she came to
 meet her friend and not her mother.
[22:06] Umar is also upstairs since then. 
What would Umar do between them?
[22:10] I will see.
[22:13] Umar, come down, 
the food is getting cold.
[22:19] My phone.
[22:22] Come on.
[22:27] Listen,
[22:29] have food and go.
[22:31] Mahi, ask your friend to stay.
[22:33] No, I just had to meet, I did.
 I have a full stomach now, I will go.
[22:43] Hey, where are you going? Have food.
[22:45] No, I will eat later. I will leave now.
[22:47] You sit, you eat food at least.
[22:49] I will go, bye.
[23:55] Get tea now Monis, you take a century.
[23:57] I got it mama, I got it.
[23:59] Give it.
[24:01] Which one is mine.
[24:01] This.
[24:02] This?
Yes, this.
[24:06] I will marry Fazeela and bring her home soon.
[24:10] Did you talk to Maheen? 
Did you ask her something?
[24:12] Umar was with her, how could I talk?
[24:15] How could I ask her
 if her mother in law is bothering her?
[24:17] Something else is bothering me mama.
[24:20] This Mahi was treating Roshni in a weird manner,
[24:24] all stuck up and Roshni too was upset with her too,
[24:27] like there was an issue between them.
[24:30] Instead of me worrying about
 if my daughter’s mother in law is bothering her,
[24:35] is the sister in law cunning or not, 
if Umar is treating her right or not,
[24:38] I should worry about her friend?
[24:41] This happens.
[24:42] She is married, and after marriage,
[24:44] friendships you made when you are
 single don’t stay the same.
[24:47] Still mama, there is something
 that I don’t understand, but I feel.
[25:11] Najia, I am getting late, come fast.
[25:13] I am here. I am here, I am ready.
[25:16] Mansoor.
[25:17] Yeah?
[25:19] Will you come soon from work?
[25:23] Yes, I will. Is there some work?
[25:25] Yes, we have to go to the doctor.
[25:32] We will see...
[25:34] Yeah, but mama asked us.
[25:39] Before this you never took 
anything mama said seriously,
[25:45] now you are in a hurry.
[25:48] Come quick, I am waiting in the car.
[25:51] Mansoor…
[26:43] Umar.
[26:47] You ironed it yourself, I would have ironed it.
[26:49] Its fine, its done now.
[26:53] Okay, I am going to make breakfast,
 what will you have?
[26:58] Should I make you flat bread?
[27:00] No, mama will make it.
[27:03] Why?
[27:05] No, cause she makes my breakfast.
[27:08] Yes, but I make it now.
[27:14] Umar, what happened?
[27:16] Are you upset with me?
[27:17] That is why you are not letting me do your work?
What happened?
[27:22] No Maheen, I am not upset,
[27:25] I just realized that
[27:29] since we both don’t believe this relation,
[27:32] then why do you have to do my work?
[27:35] Me, as a husband, don’t fulfill my rights,
 then its not your duty to do all this.
[27:45] My work is not your duty, don’t do it.
[27:50] Where did this rights and 
duties discussion come from, Umar?
[27:54] I am me,
[27:55] we are not strangers for each other.
 I am still Maheen.
[27:58] I know you are still that Maheen, 
and you are the same Umar.
[28:03] And Maheen I want that you stay 
the same Maheen and I stay the same Umar.
[28:10] I don’t want to make you work,
[28:12] I don’t want to make you and 
I realize that you are my wife.
[29:31] Where did this rights and 
duties discussion come from, Umar?
[29:34] I am me,
[29:36] we are not strangers for each other. 
I am still Maheen.
[30:11] Maheen I want that you stay
 the same Maheen and I stay the same Umar.
[30:15] I don’t want to make you work,
[30:17] I don’t want to make you and
 I realize that you are my wife.
[30:43] Maheen.
[30:47] Here, keep this.
[30:53] What is this?
[30:54] Papa, reminded me that 
I should give you pocket money.
[31:01] Pocket Money!
[31:03] Its written in the wedding papers,
[31:06] pocket money.
[31:09] So?
[31:11] Why should I take it from you?
[31:17] Papa asked me.
[31:20] Umar, you reminded me this morning 
that you are that same Umar
[31:26] and you want to stay
[31:28] that way and I am that old Maheen 
and I should stay that way.
[31:34] We shouldn’t make each other realize
 that we have the same relation.
[31:40] You don’t have any right towards me, 
nor do I have any duties.
[31:46] So then how can I take this 
money as my right?
[31:57] You are scared of making me do your 
work you will feel I am your wife,
[32:04] then how will I not consider you my husband 
when I take pocket money from you?
[32:11] I don’t want anything from you.
[32:31] Roshni,
[32:32] why don’t you come to your senses?
[32:34] Look in our homes, 
we will get proposal for people like us.
[32:39] You just suffered at the hands of Shahista just now.
[32:41] When am I saying I want to marry a billionaire.
[32:45] Okay,
[32:46] then who do you want to marry?
[32:48] Roshni, I am your mother,
 tell me clearly who do you like?
[32:54] Mama, the one I would love, 
I won’t marry him either.
[33:01] You are out of your mind.
[33:03] My mind is working fine, in fact perfect!
[33:07] You should marry someone who loves you.
[33:11] Mama, there are two things in this world, 
a lot of money or a lot of love.
[33:17] Either marry me to someone rich,
[33:20] or someone who loves me so much that 
he will keep the world at the tip of his shoes for me.
[33:26] Wow.
[33:28] This is a new scheme that has been born?
[33:30] Mama,
[33:32] I am telling you,
[33:34] if you marry me someone 
who doesn’t appreciate me,
[33:37] I will not come and beg you, 
I will make your life hell.
[33:43] My love,
[33:44] you have already done that, 
you are not giving me any comfort.
[34:00] Umar, what happened? 
Why are you not having breakfast?
[34:03] Everyone has had breakfast and left, 
and you are not even eating.
[34:07] Grandma, I don’t feel like it.
[34:10] Why? What happened?
[34:17] Grandma, tea.
[34:20] No, I don’t want to have it right now,
[34:22] I have to take my medication first.
[34:24] In fact, do one thing, 
get tea to my room, I will have it there.
[34:35] You should have had breakfast at least,
[34:37] aunt made it, not me.
[34:40] I made tea, don’t have it.
[34:44] Its not that Maheen,
[34:47] that money was given by papa,
[34:49] you can keep it.
[34:51] Fine,
[34:54] then ask uncle to give the money to me himself.
[34:56] What sort of stubbornness is this Maheen?
 How will it work like that?
[35:00] You started it Umar,
[35:02] if you think getting your work 
done is showing your right,
[35:06] then why should I show my right on you?
[35:28] Hello mama.
[35:30] Hello, you are back.
[35:33] You took so long today?
[35:35] I stopped at mama’s for a while on my way back.
[35:39] You just don’t do what I told you to,
 you just visit your mother.
[35:44] If your mother had said the same thing, 
you would never ignored it.
[35:49] I still wouldn’t be able to do mama,
[35:51] because your son has to go,
[35:53] its up to him, if he goes or doesn’t go.
[35:58] God forbid if my mother had said this,
[36:01] Mansoor would have wrecked a havoc,
[36:04] that how dare my mother say this.
[36:21] Grandma.
[36:22] Yes?
[36:23] Here you go.
[36:25] What happened? You just left like that.
[36:27] Nothing like that,
[36:30] but tell me,
[36:32] what is the planning going on between 
the one who lives upstairs and Razia?
[36:38] Who is the one who lives upstairs?
[36:39] Najia.
[36:42] Day before yesterday,
[36:44] both husband and wife were sitting 
in Razia’s room for an hour.
[36:47] The door was locked yesterday too.
[36:49] Today she came to see her 
as soon as she came from school.
[36:53] I don’t know grandma, 
she must have gone to say hello.
[36:56] Leave it, she is not that obedient.
[37:00] And you,
[37:01] you wear these two dresses, you take one off, 
wear the other, don’t you have any other clothes?
[37:05] Grandma,
[37:07] all the clothes are so heavy, 
with a lot of embroidery,
[37:09] how can I wear them at home,
[37:11] there are just a couple of light dresses, 
I wear them.
[37:13] Yes, that is right,
[37:15] the clothes in dowry are heavy,
 to wear when you go out.
[37:19] But you have been married for 2 months,
 didn’t Umar get you other clothes?
[37:24] Let him come,
[37:26] I will teach him a lesson and this Razia, 
she doesn’t realize this?
[37:29] If she tells Umar, he will listen,
[37:32] he follows Razia’s orders.
[37:35] And you too, you are sitting quietly, 
why don’t you ask Umar yourself?
[37:39] No grandma,
[37:40] I didn’t feel the need so I said nothing, 
you too please don’t say anything to Umar.
[37:46] Why don’t I say anything? 
I will surely tell him.
[37:49] Yes!
