[00:20] Man, Nabeel talks so nicely,
[00:23] I didn’t even know how 2-3 days passed.
[00:25] You know they have a huge house in Islamabad,
[00:28] they are calling me to stay, I will surely go.
[00:31] Roshni,
[00:32] Umar came.
[00:36] Okay.
[00:37] Yes, and he was saying that
I really care for you.
[00:42] Why?
[00:43] What happened to me,
that you will care for me?
[00:46] Nothing, he said he will talk to grandma,
[00:51] grandma likes him and…
[00:54] One minute,
[00:55] I don’t trust Umar,
[00:58] and I have seen your grandma’s worth,
[01:01] have wasted enough time after Umar. Now,
[01:04] I am seriously thinking about my future.
[01:08] Roshni, can I ask you something?
[01:10] No, I don’t have time,
I am a very busy girl.
[01:15] Because I have to go home
and make tea for Nabeel.
[01:19] Roshni…
[01:20] Bye.
[01:22] Roshni.
[01:33] I have been shouting for 3 days that my
blood pressure medicine has ended,
[01:38] but no one cares.
[01:41] Now there is no
medicine in the packet.
[01:45] What will I do all day long?
[01:56] Oh, what happened to my son?
[02:02] Come here.
[02:05] Come to me.
[02:08] Your mother must have scolded you,
[02:11] she is always after you.
She always curses you.
[02:17] Tell me.
[02:18] Grandma, nothing.
If you were not there,
[02:22] God knows what would
happen to me. Can I massage you?
[02:27] I was thinking something that
[02:30] lets go out, just you and me.
[02:33] Yes, why not.
[02:36] Do one thing, take me to the doctor.
[02:39] I am asking about going out,
you are talking about the doctor.
[02:42] Then,
[02:44] lets go to the market,
[02:46] I have to get a veil and stuff too.
[02:50] Grandma, we will do it on our way back.
[02:54] Lets do one thing,
lets go to aunt Zakia’s.
[03:01] Hey,
[03:03] you want to take me out or
make me go out of my mind?
[03:06] I don’t want to go to her,
[03:08] she has not asked me how
I have been since then.
[03:11] She fought with Razia,
[03:14] what is her mother in law’s fault?
She forgot her.
[03:17] I care about you grandma,
[03:20] I know you want to meet
Monis and Mahi. Right?
[03:24] It’s the truth.
I really want to meet them,
[03:28] but what can I do?
I have put a stone on my heart.
[03:33] Anyway,
[03:35] when Zakia has stopped us,
what can we do?
[03:39] I will make sure I do everything for you,
[03:44] I will get you a great bride.
[03:47] Your mother has given me
all rights to find your bride.
[03:52] This is even better.
Lets do one thing.
[03:56] Lets do one thing,
[03:57] go meet aunt Zakia and find a bride there.
[03:59] What?
[04:00] Now think, if we go to their locality,
[04:03] aunt Zakia will get jealous.
[04:05] This is the best way to make her jealous.
[04:07] Damn it,
[04:08] why would we go to her locality,
[04:10] she only has weird girls there.
[04:15] Not everyone.
[04:17] I mean, there must be someone good.
[04:19] We will find her and bring her here,
so that there is light in this home.
[04:22] No brother, I won’t go that far.
[04:25] I will look in my locality,
if I don’t find someone good here,
[04:28] then we will go somewhere else.
I won’t go there.
[04:51] Bring me tea.
[04:53] I will.
[04:57] Thank you.
Ouch. Ouch ouch.
[05:00] You are going disappointed today too?
[05:03] No,
[05:04] at least she didn’t drag me out,
[05:07] all will be well slowly.
[05:16] Did you meet Roshni?
[05:20] No,
[05:23] not yet.
[05:26] Umar,
[05:28] what if its late?
[05:29] It won’t be,
[05:31] I told you it will soon be fine, slowly.
[05:36] Mahi, I know she will wait for me,
[05:44] I will have to think for her too.
[05:47] I don’t want to meet her
and her mother finding out,
[05:51] she will get defamed for no reason.
[05:54] You know, because of my stupidity,
I can make mistakes.
[05:57] I am being careful.
[06:03] She is fine, right?
[06:04] Yeah.
[06:08] Tell her I miss her,
[06:11] give her courage.
[06:13] Tell her that Umar will
fulfill all his promises,
[06:18] if God wills.
[06:28] Hello.
[06:30] What is your problem?
[06:32] Has no one taught you manners?
Stop calling.
[06:37] What happened?
[06:38] Who is it?
[06:40] I don’t know some damned man,
he has been calling for so long.
[06:44] Why didn’t you tell me?
[06:45] Or you should have told Monis,
we would have beaten him up.
[06:47] Yes, I should have.
[06:49] How did he get your number?
[06:51] I don’t know, I give no one my number,
only close relatives.
[06:55] Roshni took my phone,
[06:56] I have been getting calls since
the phone came from her.
[07:00] What do you want to say?
[07:02] These calls are cause of Roshni?
[07:04] I didn’t say that.
[07:05] I only told you, cause you asked.
[07:07] Or I would not know,
[07:09] you two are the same, you take things
in different directions, go get married.
[07:12] Tch.
[07:17] Now you are getting upset and leaving.
[07:32] Ludo in our home,
[07:34] snooker in your home.
[07:38] We have a shower
[07:40] and you have a swimming pool.
[07:43] Aunt Shahista was telling me
[07:45] she works out at home to stay fit,
[07:49] so you have a gym there.
[07:50] You must have a huge home.
[07:53] Its just that the two of us live alone there,
[07:56] its not a big house,
a lot of rooms are empty,
[07:59] in some mama made her gym,
I made my study in one.
[08:06] I saw pictures,
[08:08] there is a swimming pool too,
its really pretty.
[08:14] Do one thing,
[08:16] come and see for yourself.
[08:18] Huh?
[08:21] No, come home.
[08:23] I want to come,
[08:25] but my mama doesn’t let me go out.
[08:29] All our relatives live here.
[08:35] You have no relation with us?
[08:40] If you want, I can talk to aunt.
[08:44] Talk to mama?
[08:46] Yeah,
[08:47] to send you over for a few days.
[08:54] Really?
[08:56] I have one condition,
[08:59] when you go there,
you will have to make coffee yourself.
[09:03] You know,
[09:04] going there,
[09:06] I will miss you coffee the most.
[09:10] You make awesome coffee.
[09:15] Someone is outside.
[09:19] Okay, I will open it.
[09:21] I will go.
[09:22] You sit here, I will open it.
[09:36] Come on.
[09:39] Hello.
[09:41] Hi, I am Nabeel, and you?
[09:45] Mahi.
[09:49] Hey Maheen, my friend is here.
[09:55] Do you want something?
You could have called?
[09:58] I have something important to talk about.
[10:00] What is your name?
[10:02] Maheen.
[10:04] You guys are like best friends, or what?
[10:06] Yeah.
[10:07] Roshni, I want to talk to you.
[10:08] Yes, come along, we will talk.
[10:10] I will be back in a minute.
[10:14] It won’t take long, she is my friend,
I need to give her time. What is it, say?
[10:18] Listen,
[10:19] did you call someone on this number?
[10:22] This person is calling me and disturbing
me again and again. Who is he?
[10:25] Hey, I don’t know,
[10:27] I took your phone once
and you are blaming me.
[10:30] I am not blaming you,
[10:32] since you took the phone,
he is really bothering me.
[10:34] He messages often, calls.
[10:37] I got a call in front of mama,
in front of Umar even. It looks bad.
[10:40] Hey, its not my problem,
[10:42] you see I am busy, can we not talk later?
[10:46] Can we not talk about this either?
[10:48] We will talk later please.
[10:50] Roshni,…
[10:52] Please, take good care, ok?
[10:55] take care, and say hello to mama.
[10:58] Hey, have coffee and go.
[11:00] Bye.
[11:01] I will give her coffee. Bye.
[11:04] She is my friend.
[11:05] Is she your neighbor?
[11:06] Yes, neighbor, in fact, she asks for a lot of time,
cause she is a good friend,
[11:11] so what were you saying?
[11:14] Nothing, just like that.
I was thinking, lets go shopping.
[11:18] We will have to take
permission from mama.
[11:22] What is the problem in that?
I will take permission.
[11:25] Fine,
[11:27] lets go.
[11:32] Okay, that is fine, make me tea.
[11:36] Okay.
[11:41] Yeah. Come my love.
Come. Come. Come.
[11:47] Papa, hello.
[11:50] Hello. You are home early today?
[11:53] All okay?
[11:55] You…
[11:56] You must want money,
[12:00] you are ashamed to ask your father.
[12:03] That’s good.
[12:05] Okay then, this shame is enough.
[12:10] You know Umar…
[12:12] no leave it.
[12:14] You think I like insulting you for money?
[12:18] It hurts me,
[12:21] I want you to realize your responsibility.
You know what responsibility is?
[12:26] Papa, what is wrong?
I want to talk about something else.
[12:29] Actually,
[12:33] I..i wanted that I…
[12:36] if you can take me to work
with you from tomorrow. So…
[12:41] What? When I used to say this to earlier, you told me,
[12:47] that I didn’t do my masters,
[12:50] some aspirations, etc, to go sell sprays,
I have some dreams,
[12:54] where are they nowadays?
[12:57] I have them right now too.
[13:01] You know I am looking for a job for long,
[13:04] I will do that,
[13:06] I just don’t want to waste time.
[13:12] I…
[13:16] I have thought a lot,
[13:20] I want that I stand on my own feet,
I have decided.
[13:23] Wow, good.
[13:26] You know
[13:31] mama has so many dreams for me.
You…
[13:38] I will do work and earn money and fulfill her wishes,
I want that mama stays happy.
[13:51] Ahhh
[13:54] Umar, are you ok?
do you have fever?
[13:58] What is it papa.
[13:59] Get him tea. Get him tea.
[14:04] Sit.
[14:06] Okay.
[14:08] I will go get you tea.
[14:09] Okay. Okay.
[14:15] Tea for papa?
[14:26] Stand on his own feet…
[14:32] I am really tired today.
[14:34] Really.
[14:39] Do you want tea or water?
[14:40] Just get water child.
[14:43] Lemonade?
[14:44] Get it. Get it.
[14:49] Today, I met such old relatives that
I have not met in ages, is someone left?
[14:56] No one is left. Its good you met them.
[14:59] After all, these relatives have complaints
[15:02] from those who live abroad,
they meet very little and then,
[15:05] I have gone to my parents’ grave,
[15:10] but some people are not in the world,
[15:14] its good I met those who remain.
[15:16] Yeah.
[15:18] You met them with so much love,
[15:20] but your poor relatives were jealous
it was evident in their face.
[15:24] Water.
[15:26] No lemons.
[15:28] Mama.
[15:34] Nothing like that,
everyone met me with love.
[15:39] Only those met with love, who have daughters,
[15:42] cause they thought you
were looking for a bride for your son.
[15:48] Huh?
[15:49] Yeah, that is possible,
[15:51] but you know my son has selected his bride,
[16:00] and what my son likes, I like.
[16:07] God bless, who is that lucky girl?
[16:11] When we bring the proposal,
we will tell them.
[16:38] What is it?
[16:40] What took you so long,
I was waiting for you for so long.
[16:45] What is it? I thought you called me
cause Umar wanted you to.
[16:48] He will not come,
[16:49] he told you he will come with a
proposal this time, then see,
[16:52] he is head strong,
[16:54] he is not even messaging you,
[16:56] he told me to tell you that its
his first day at work tomorrow.
[17:03] He got  job?
[17:05] No,
[17:06] right now he will work with uncle,
he will work.
[17:11] You mean, he will kill pests,
become a doctor for plants?
[17:15] Roshni,
[17:17] you don’t want to talk to him,
don’t want to meet him till the wedding is fixed.
[17:23] I get that, after all,
girls should be careful,
[17:26] but you are upset with him,
you are angry.
[17:29] I am not angry with him,
I am angry at myself.
[17:32] Roshni.
[17:34] Hey, Roshni.
[17:36] I am going, guests are over,
[17:39] I need to give them time.
[17:40] Wow Roshni,
[17:41] since they came,
[17:43] you are giving them time,
you have not given me any time.
[17:45] You have met me after so long.
[17:47] What guests are these?
[17:49] They came after ages and
now they don’t want to go?
[17:52] Hey, what is your problem?
Are they bothering you?
[17:56] They are really dear to you,
[17:58] you are not giving your friend time,
you forgot about your love.
[18:01] You think, I am mad. I am not mad,
you cannot fool me,
[18:05] I know the wrong calls
I am getting on my phone,
[18:07] those are cause of you. If I tell Umar,
you will see what he will do to you.
[18:10] What did you say?
[18:11] Are you threatening me?
[18:13] You are scaring me with
Umar’s name?
[18:16] what if those wrong calls are cause of
[18:19] and now that you are getting married,
you are blaming me for it.
[18:23] You want to prove that you are innocent,
that will not happen.
[18:27] Roshni, you think so negative.
[18:30] Go, I don’t want to talk to you.
[18:32] Yes, I am not dying to talk to you.
[18:36] You will tell Umar!
[18:56] You are leaving in the morning?
[18:59] Yes, its been so long,
[19:01] we came for 3-4 days and stayed longer,
[19:05] so we will have to go back.
[19:08] I feel you came today and leaving tomorrow,
[19:13] stay for 2 more days please.
[19:16] I would have stayed but there
is a lot of work when I go back,
[19:20] I need to set the office, I need to set the home,
[19:23] so I got mama here first
so that she doesn’t complain.
[19:27] So you will never come back?
[19:30] When did I say that?
[19:32] You will get busy, that is why.
[19:36] I will, but you can come,
you are not busy.
[19:41] Who will bring me from here?
[19:50] We will do something,
[19:52] that aunt sends you to us herself.
[19:55] If you want, I can talk to mama.
[20:01] Really?
[20:03] Yes,
[20:04] I will come to get you myself.
[20:08] Fine,
[20:09] do you need help in packing.
[20:12] No, I am good, I will do it.
[20:15] Can I get coffee?
[20:17] I will make it.
[21:03] Okay Zubeda, I am going,
[21:05] you have to come to me for a long time.
[21:09] I will come when
I get done with work at home.
[21:13] Then send Roshni,
[21:15] this way she will see our home.
[21:17] Its my daughter,
[21:20] I have not done anything like this before,
and then it’s a different city.
[21:23] Aunty, why do you worry?
[21:25] I will come pick her up here,
[21:27] I will visit here often for business
[21:33] and by the way Roshni,
[21:35] I will really miss your coffee.
[21:37] Fine, then for your
coffee we will take Roshni.
[21:43] Lets go, we are getting late.
[21:45] Okay, come on.
[21:46] Do come, okay.
[21:48] Bye.
[21:50] I will take it.
[21:53] What is wrong with you?
[21:54] Cheer up, I am coming to get you.
[22:03] You really care about your clothes,
that is where you will sit.
[22:08] Its dirty.
[22:09] You go do some rest.
[22:11] Adjust
[22:11] Well done.
[23:28] I had to get her a gift,
[23:31] this is from my first earning.
[23:36] Did you tell her?
[23:39] She was really happy to 
know that you are doing it.
[23:44] hahahah
[23:46] You didn’t mind?
[23:48] No,
[23:51] I don’t mind anything you say.
[23:55] I felt one thing though.
[23:58] What?
[24:02] I felt that she thinks that 
I am passing my time with her,
[24:11] fake love, its not true, 
you know how much I love her.
[24:17] If someone doubts my love, 
it hurts me.
[24:25] I want to make her 
believe that I really love her.
[24:30] Really, a lot.
[24:34] Umar,
[24:36] I fear that it will get late…
[24:39] No, it wont be late,
[24:40] I am mama and papa’s favorite nowadays, 
and also grandma’s beloved.
[24:45] I will get grandma to do everything.
[24:49] Just tell her to care 
for grandma on your wedding,
[24:53] then you will see the magic.
[24:57] Did you sit with mama?
[25:00] Sit with her, talk to her, 
she is upset, she will feel better.
[25:06] She is upset on something and 
take the anger out of me,
[25:11] I am used to it, I will do it.
[25:17] Mahi,
[25:19] one minute.
[25:21] What is this?
[25:43] Roshni.
[25:48] We met finally.
[26:05] Oh God, its tough Roshni,
[26:08] and her mother is there too.
[26:12] Hello aunty,
[26:14] I forgot something with Monis, 
so I was honking the horn.
[26:21] Are you ok?
[26:30] I made a mistake.
[26:46] Till today nothing happened
[26:49] cause of me that his payment got delayed
[26:53] and he had to call to inform me.
[27:02] When I had given you the money, 
why didn’t it reach them?
[27:08] I am asking you something Umar.
[27:12] Papa I will drop the money 
by tomorrow morning.
[27:16] Fine,
[27:19] this shouldn’t happen again.
[27:21] The name is utmost importance 
in business child.
[27:25] Yes.
[27:27] Get it?
[27:28] Umer.
[27:29] Yes.
[27:33] You have the money, right?
[27:39] No…
[27:45] Where did you spend the money?
[27:50] Papa…actually,
[27:54] I had to get something for me,
[27:57] so I forgot that this was not my money, 
I had it in my pocket, so I spent it.
[28:13] Look child, it was 
not that big some of money,
[28:16] it was just 25 thousand, I had to 
give it as fees for getting electricity work.
[28:24] Its not about the money, 
its about responsibility.
[28:29] Understand?
[28:31] Yes, it wont happen again.
[28:37] Fine.
[28:42] I felt you would scold him a lot.
[28:48] Yes, I would have scolded him if
[28:51] he had not spoken the truth
[28:53] or said he dropped the money.
[28:58] He told me clearly,
[29:01] he spoke the truth,
[29:03] now I will scold my young son 
for 25 thousand.
[29:09] Young son?
[29:12] He spent 25 thousand,
[29:16] but came home empty handed,
[29:18] this is something more worrisome.
[29:29] Look, who has come?
[29:32] Look, who sent this.
[29:42] Nabeel and aunt Shahista.
[29:44] When they came earlier, 
they came empty handed,
[29:48] what is the point of sending this now?
[29:49] Mama, its my birthday.
[29:53] But Roshni, how did Shahista 
know it was your birthday?
[29:57] Mama, Nabeel asked me once specially
[30:00] when it was my birthday. 
See he remembered.
[30:06] Great, show me, what all is there?
[30:08] Give it. Give it all.
[30:10] I want to see it too.
[30:28] Maheen.
[30:30] You are back.
[30:31] Yes, happy birthday.
[30:34] Thank you, I was waiting for you.
[30:36] Come inside,
[30:38] leave this, I want to show you this,
[30:40] this perfume, this watch, these flowers, 
Nabeel sent it all for me.
[30:44] Nabeel?
[30:46] Nabeel, aunt Shahista’s son, my cousin.
[30:49] First he surprised me in the morning, 
called me exactly at 12.
[30:54] He wished me and didn’t tell me 
he was sending me gifts.
[30:57] Roshni,
[30:59] you have stopped Umar from 
calling you and messaging you,
[31:05] you will get defamed. 
Then this Nabeel called you at 12.
[31:08] Why mention Umar?
[31:11] He is a stranger for my family.
[31:13] If I get caught talking to Umar at night, 
my mama will beat me up.
[31:18] All these gifts, 
these came in front of mama.
[31:25] What happened?
[31:26] Okay listen,
[31:28] if you talk to Nabeel, instead of Umar at night,
[31:32] would they object or not?  
They will, cause he is a stranger.
[31:35] Yes,
[31:37] Nabeel is a stranger for me,
[31:40] but how did Umar 
become a stranger for you,
[31:42] I didn’t even know.
[31:44] Leave it man,
[31:45] tell me, how expensive is this watch?
[31:49] 10 thousand? 20 thousand?
[31:51] And this perfume, I used to look 
away cause it was so expensive.
[31:55] What is in your hand?
[31:56] errr…
[32:00] I was going to the 
market to get this changed,
[32:03] your home came on the way.
[32:05] Tie the strap please.
[32:15] I look good? I look rich?
[32:17] You seem that way?
[32:21] You will open it right now?
[32:22] Yes.
[32:47] Come downstairs,
[32:49] come on, the cat will catch you.
[32:51] What happened Mahi? 
I was waiting for your call.
[32:54] Yes,
[32:55] sorry,
[32:57] I was busy with work at 
home and forgot to call.
[33:00] Meaning, when its my job, 
you got busy. You forgot.
[33:04] It was a small thing,
[33:05] I just said deliver the gift and 
let me talk to her from your phone.
[33:09] She told me not to call, 
she doesn’t have an issue with you calling.
[33:13] Umar,
[33:14] whether you do it this way 
or that way, it’s the same.
[33:17] When she said no to talk to you, 
then you know what that means.
[33:22] Yes, but I wanted to wish her 
on her birthday. Try and understand.
[33:29] You promised not to call right, 
she didn’t.
[33:32] if she wants, she can call you.
[33:39] She is a little stubborn.
[33:41] Anyway, if she is not stubborn with me, 
who would she be stubborn with.
[33:45] Tell me, how did she like the gift?
[33:52] Speak up.
[33:54] That…mama was unwell, 
so I couldn’t give her the gift.
[34:01] Here you go!
[34:03] I gave you one small task, 
you couldn’t do that.
[34:07] Sorry, I will give the gift.
[34:09] Promise.
[34:12] Umar, don’t get upset.
[34:20] Hey stay at home on the holiday, 
you are ready to leave again.
[34:24] I have just one off day, 
I have a 1000 things to do.
[34:27] Go madam, do you work,
[34:30] I don’t want you to sit with me,
[34:33] I am talking about Mansoor,
[34:35] he should spend time 
with us on the off day,
[34:40] Mama, why…
[34:41] Hello aunt!
[34:49] Hello sister in law, how are you?
[34:51] Me? I am like this.
[34:57] If you don’t miss your train, 
go make me cup of tea before you go.
[35:02] Sure.
[35:03] Come.
[35:03] Where is grandma?
[35:04] Where would grandma be?
[35:07] I have to sit alone on a holiday,
[35:10] my son is taken away by his wife, 
and the husband with his mother,
[35:14] God knows what shrine they want to.
[35:21] Najia, get tea quickly.
[35:26] Why tea in such hot weather.
[35:29] Headaches don’t care about hot or cold weather.
[35:32] I will have tea, I will feel better.
[35:35] Najia, just get one cup of tea, 
Monis is feeling hot.
[35:43] Okay, Monis, tell me more,

[35:46] Mama is fine nowadays.
[35:50] Yes, she only gets other unwell.
[35:56] No, I get that, but you hear me child.
[36:01] Hello.
[36:04] Oh no, he is saying, 
he is coming to get you.
[36:10] What? Such a good news.
[36:12] Mama, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. 
I will tell you that I will go for sure.
[36:17] Are you mad?
[36:19] How do I let you go with a single man alone?
[36:24] What alone travel.
[36:25] He will take me on the plane, 
it won’t be empty, there will be people.
[36:30] Aunt Shahista is calling me 
and I don’t go anywhere.
[36:36] Please.
[36:37] Be quiet and sit, you have never stayed 
with your uncle and aunt, but you will go here.
[36:43] Tell me something,
[36:44] there is no girl your age in Shahista’s 
home, what would you do there?
[36:49] Oh mama, I don’t get it what 
girls have smart mothers.
[36:54] Don’t you get it? Aunt 
Shahista is being nice to me,
[36:59] why is she calling me there, and 
how many times she told you she likes me.
[37:06] Okay, so this is the deal.
[37:11] Then it will look even worse living there like this.
[37:15] Mama, they are modern people,
[37:19] they don’t care about such things.
[37:21] She wants that before marriage,
[37:24] I see the environment of their home, 
them. Its good for me.
[37:29] That is fine,
[37:32] but if they send the proposal properly, 
it would have been good.
[37:34] Mama,
[37:36] they will send the proposal,
[37:38] you first give me the permission.
[37:40] I feel you gave me permission,
[37:43] I am going to go pack, 
you too come quick.
[37:45] Roshni!
