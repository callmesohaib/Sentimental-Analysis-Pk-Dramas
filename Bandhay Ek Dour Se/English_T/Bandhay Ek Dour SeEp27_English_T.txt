[00:35] Are you going to the hospital?
[00:37] To meet uncle.
[00:40] Yes.
[00:41] I made food for him,
[00:46] I will also come along.
[00:51] Why?
[00:52] Because I have to meet uncle,
[00:54] ask him how he is.
[00:56] Really?
[00:58] You know he had given up
hope of your return.
[01:02] He asked about you a lot,
[01:04] so no need to do this favor on him now.
[01:10] I have to apologize to him too.
[01:14] That’s what you came here to say?
[01:18] You know, you didn’t have a
good excuse to leave from here,
[01:21] you didn’t even tell anyone,
[01:22] apart from you disliking being with me.
[01:25] Now have you thought of
a good excuse to come back?
[01:28] Or the way you suddenly
didn’t like being with me,
[01:32] you like being with me.
[01:34] I just left, because I feared that
no one in this home needed me,
[01:39] but its evident that everyone needs me,
[01:42] so I came back.
[01:44] No,
[01:46] I still don’t need you.
[01:48] I know and I also know that you have freed me
from all your rights and duties.
[01:55] But with regards to everyone else,
I have some duties,
[01:58] I have come to live up to those
and you cannot stop me from that.
[02:03] You realized this really soon.
[02:06] I realized it, Umar.
[02:08] You just need to realize
[02:10] and that is enough,
[02:13] even if you realize it later.
[03:03] Mama, earlier you were worried that
she has come to stay at her mother’s home,
[03:07] now that she has left you are sitting here crying.
[03:11] I am crying thinking what
she must be going through there.
[03:15] I have seen Razia and mama’s manners,
[03:19] they have poison in their
hearts for me and Maheen.
[03:24] They will not be at peace
till they spit out the poison.
[03:27] My daughter, she is so sensitive already,
what must she be going through.
[03:32] Hey, she must have thought
about something and went.
[03:35] After all, aunt and uncle were
angry on her not coming back,
[03:38] now that she has gone back,
the anger will go.
[03:40] It won’t go like that,
[03:43] till the time they don’t
destroy her with their taunts,
[03:47] their anger will not go.
[03:49] Brother is still not home,
he is still in the hospital.
[03:54] If he was home he would have made
the environment of the home worth living in.
[03:59] What will my daughter do,
she is all alone with her in-laws?
[04:03] She is not alone,
[04:05] Umar is there with her.
[04:18] Maheen, stop child,
[04:20] daughters don’t look good apologizing.
[04:25] Uncle, are you upset with me?
[04:29] No, not at all.
[04:34] Umar, see how she is losing it by crying like this.
[04:36] Get her water.
[04:41] Uncle, you please come home quickly, please.
[04:45] Yes, my daughter is home now,
[04:49] I will come home soon.
[04:51] Right Umar?
[05:00] Maheen, don’t worry child,
[05:04] life is really long, okay?
[05:09] Everything will be fine.
[05:13] Show me how you smile.
[05:19] Well done.
[05:38] Umar.
[05:41] Listen, you go to sleep,
[05:44] this is not the time to walk on the roof,
[05:49] you have to wake up in the morning
and go to the hospital and also to work.
[05:53] I know,
[05:57] but I cannot sleep here now.
[06:00] I am going to aunt’s room anyway.
[06:03] When did I say that
I cannot sleep here because of you.
[06:07] It doesn’t matter to me
whether you go from here or not.
[06:14] Did you hear me, it doesn’t matter to me.
[06:18] That is really good,
[06:21] because aunt needs me right now,
so I will sleep there for a few days.
[06:27] Listen.
[06:30] What?
[06:32] Nothing Maheen.
[06:36] Go!
[07:47] Hello.
[07:49] You are still up?
[07:52] Yes.
[07:54] Why didn’t you sleep?
[07:58] I don’t know.
[07:59] Because she has come back, that’s why?
[08:03] Who?
[08:03] She.
[08:05] Umar, you said she would never come back
[08:09] and you made me believe it,
so I came back.
[08:13] I had left,
[08:15] I was gone from between you two.
[08:18] You brought her back.
[08:23] Umar, why don’t you let me get on a side?
[08:26] Roshni, I didn’t bring her back,
[08:28] she came herself.
[08:30] Because you left the door open, that’s why.
[08:33] It’s a sign for people
who leave that when they want,
[08:37] they can come back.
[08:39] Why didn’t you close the door Umar?
[08:44] Roshni, I don’t understand
what you are saying, right now.
[08:47] Please, we will talk in the morning.
[08:48] Oh,
[08:51] why?
[08:52] She is with you, that is why?
[08:55] She is not with me. she is not here.
[09:02] Hello.
[09:03] Hello, Umar?
[09:04] Hello.
[09:25] She is not here,
[09:26] but still why do I feel she is here,
[09:30] near me.
[09:35] I don’t even want your feeling.
[10:00] Maheen.
[10:02] Hey, Maheen.
[10:11] Yes aunt?
[10:13] This has been ringing on my head for so long.
[10:15] Must be your mother’s.
[10:16] She must be restless,
[10:18] pick it up
[10:19] and curse me to your heart’s content.
[10:26] Hello mama.
[10:35] Mama, you called so early in the morning
and woke up aunt.
[10:38] What?
[10:40] Was your phone in Razia’s room?
[10:44] Yes, I went to give breakfast to aunt,
[10:47] I was having tea with her,
[10:49] so I left my phone there.
[10:52] Oh Maheen,
[10:53] my night was spent staying up and
thinking how you will be treated by your in-laws?
[11:00] My heart was restless.
[11:01] No, nothing like that,
[11:03] everyone is treating me nicely and with love.
[11:07] Thank God.
[11:09] And Umar?
[11:10] He must have shown that he is upset.
[11:13] No,
[11:14] but if he shows me he is upset,
[11:17] I will tolerate it.
[11:18] Well done child,
[11:20] this is how an obedient wife is like.
[11:23] Stay happy and may God
always keep you happy.
[11:26] Come on go now, do your work.
[11:29] When your uncle comes home,
I will come to meet him.
[11:31] Okay?
[11:33] Yes mama.
[11:34] Bye.
[11:48] Grandma.
[11:50] Grandma,
[11:51] should I make you breakfast?
[11:54] Leave it,
[11:56] Najia makes it daily,
[11:58] she will make it today too.
[11:59] You don’t worry.
[12:01] But I have asked Najia
that she should rest now,
[12:05] I am here
[12:06] so I will do all the work at home
and when I am free,
[12:09] I will go upstairs and help her too.
[12:18] Should I make you breakfast?
[13:00] You are not giving up Maheen,
[13:03] so how can I?
[13:07] I will see how long you can stand in front of me,
[13:10] how many times will you come back?
[13:13] I will force you to go back again and again.
[14:23] What work have you gotten into?
[14:25] Papa,
[14:27] you should look good all the time,
[14:30] and what are kids for?
They are here to care for you, right?
[14:34] I spoke to the doctor
[14:36] and he told me,
[14:39] he will discharge you soon.
[14:42] Thank God.
[14:44] I will go in a little while and inform mama too.
[14:48] Okay tell me,
[14:51] is your mother treating
Maheen properly or not?
[14:54] Or is she still upset?
[15:01] At least she is not treating her
as badly as Maheen said about us.
[15:11] Leave it son,
[15:12] even tell Razia to take all this out of her heart,
[15:15] she has come back, she is embarrassed.
[15:20] Papa,
[15:23] we will forget,
[15:25] but will the rest of the people forget?
[15:28] The whole family knows that we torment her,
[15:34] although there is no truth behind this,
[15:36] you people will get defamed so badly.
[15:41] Whether I accepted her
my wife from my heart or not,
[15:43] that is different,
[15:45] but I never told her this,
[15:47] nor made it evident that she is an unwanted…
[15:51] What did you say Umar?
[15:55] Unwanted relation?
[15:59] This means you never accepted her
your wife with your heart?
[16:07] Papa, I didn’t mean…
[16:08] Whatever it is, that’s it.
[16:11] You said what was in your heart.
[16:17] It is an unwanted relation,
[16:22] forced on to you.
[16:26] I am sorry,
[16:31] I tied you in this unwanted relation, forcefully.
[16:37] I am sorry.
[16:38] That it's.
[17:13] Your mother has brought you up well.
[17:17] Now see, girls of today,
[17:20] they become friends, let them talk,
let them do fashion.
[17:25] Who would come sit with
elder like this for so long.
[17:29] Mama says that elders are a blessing,
[17:31] you should take their prayers.
[17:33] I came to get those.
[17:34] Live long child, live long.
[17:36] Stay happy.
[17:45] Maheen, you are back.
[17:48] When I went to your home,
[17:49] I found out from aunt Zakia that you are back.
[17:54] My home?
[17:56] You are in my home, Roshni.
[17:59] Okay, its good you considered this your home,
[18:03] now be careful,
[18:05] you change your thinking quickly.
[18:08] Yes, you never know about her,
when she wants, she packs her bag and leave.
[18:13] This time Razia is on the bed,
[18:16] okay, use my name,
[18:18] say that the grandma didn’t let you stay.
[18:33] Shall we go?
[18:52] Mama, hurry up I am getting late.
[18:54] Yes,
[18:56] here, this has been ironed for long.
[18:58] I just went to get vegetables.
[19:01] The vegetable is just an excuse
to talk to the neighbors, mama.
[19:05] Okay, so what do I do?
[19:06] I am alone, should I talk to the walls?
[19:09] I will go to your in-laws in the evening today
and come back after fixing your wedding date.
[19:13] Mama, I will be late in the evening,
I will also go meet uncle.
[19:17] Yes, fine. Fine.
[19:19] Go to their home as well,
we will also find out how Maheen is.
[19:23] We went yesterday
[19:24] and we came back from there yesterday, mama.
[19:26] Can I tell you one thing,
[19:28] I don’t like going to my sister’s home this often.
[19:30] You call her, you will be at peace.
[19:32] Yes, Roshni will tell me how she is,
[19:35] she went to meet her today.
[19:38] She went there?
[19:40] Yes, her mother told me,
I met her at the vegetable shop just now.
[19:44] Why did she go there?
[19:46] Why did she go?
[19:47] To meet her.
[19:49] To find out about her mother in law’s health,
[19:51] she is her friend.
[19:52] What friend?
[19:53] Maheen was here for so many days,
[19:55] but I didn’t see her coming to meet Maheen,
[19:57] however, we are next door neighbors,
[19:59] but she went to meet her so far.
[20:00] Wow.
[20:03] Why do you get so weird
when Roshni’s name is taken.
[20:07] Question after question.
[20:10] I don’t know mama,
[20:12] there is something weird.
[20:14] What?
[20:15] Don’t you think so?
[20:17] I mean, they were such good
friends before the wedding,
[20:19] they used to meet a lot
[20:20] and after the wedding they have gone quiet.
[20:22] When they talk they talk like strangers.
[20:24] Okay, I agree there are ups
and downs in friendship,
[20:28] these things happen.
[20:30] But one thing that
I don’t understand is that,
[20:33] after marriage, the Roshni
that stays away from Maheen,
[20:37] why is she getting so close to her in-laws?
[20:53] Bye.
[20:57] Bye.
[21:06] I am really happy to see you here.
[21:10] Really?
[21:12] And I am happier to know
that you have become smart
[21:16] and you can take your own decisions.
[21:19] And this decision you took after thinking hard,
[21:22] after seeing your gain and loss.
[21:28] Wow.
[21:36] What benefit?
[21:38] Which gain?
[21:40] First time the groom went away from the door,
[21:43] divorce the second time,
[21:45] who would have asked
about you the third time, Maheen?
[21:48] You don’t have education,
nor any wealth from your father,
[21:51] and an average face.
[21:53] In this moment, losing a husband like
Umar would have been stupidity,
[21:57] which is something you didn’t do.
[21:59] Now see,
[22:01] without respect you can survive,
[22:03] but to live a life you need to set your feet,
[22:06] that is what you have done.
[22:08] Now whether Umar loves you or not,
[22:11] it doesn’t matter.
[22:24] Wrong.
[22:33] I took this decision with my heart too,
[22:37] seeing gain and benefit is your habit, Roshni,
[22:41] not mine.
[22:43] And your second guess about me is wrong too,
[22:47] I don’t have to set
my feet anywhere to live my life,
[22:53] husband, home, in-laws,
[22:55] these are part of my life for sure,
[22:58] but not the most important mission of my life.
[23:03] I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
[23:06] To get a husband or in other words,
[23:12] to get a man,
[23:16] a person can pass any limit.
[23:18] What limit did I cross?
[23:20] I left Umar for you,
[23:22] you came back to get the bounty,
[23:25] you are calling me a girl with an ordinary thinking,
what are you, yourself?
[23:29] Even tolerating a man’s dislike you
want to make a place in his life.
[23:33] And when you were unable to make a place,
[23:34] then you want to make a place
for yourself in this home.
[23:38] I told you,
[23:40] to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
[23:47] for me, other things matter too,
[23:50] like relations,
[23:52] faithfulness,
[23:53] trust,
[23:55] and friendship.
[23:58] And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
[24:05] They are not just my in-laws, Roshni,
[24:08] they are my own, my family.
[24:12] And Umar,
[24:14] he is not just my husband,
[24:17] he is also my childhood friend,
[24:20] my partner since childhood
[24:23] and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
[24:28] I am saying all this…
[24:29] What all this?
[24:30] Huh?
[24:32] I know it all,
[24:33] I have understood it
[24:35] and very soon Umar too will understand.
[24:38] This was deceit,
[24:39] that he considered love, is a big deceit.
[24:43] You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
[24:47] You lied to him,
[24:49] and that poor thing,
[24:52] he didn’t lie, you did.
[24:55] He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
[25:01] Umar…
[25:03] I made a mistake,
[25:05] but I love Umar even today.
[25:31] Stop it Roshni,
[25:34] now,
[25:36] I can’t trust you,
[25:40] I don’t believe you even this much.
[25:43] You kept me and Umar in the dark, all of us.
[25:48] Now how do I trust you,
[25:52] you left him for betterment for someone else,
so you will leave him again.
[26:00] You have the courage to break his heart once,
then you cam have the courage again.
[26:06] I don’t trust you at all.
[26:12] And yes,
[26:14] I have come back,
[26:18] not to get Umar,
[26:22] but to save him.
[26:50] I am sad that
[26:53] one decision of mine,
[26:57] maybe ruined Umar’s life, maybe.
[27:03] Don’t think like that papa.
[27:09] This is one thought
[27:12] that is bothering me every moment.
[27:19] When I see him caring
for me with his head down,
[27:26] it hurts me in the heart.
[27:34] Where did that smile of his go?
[27:38] His showing off? His stupidity?
It all got lost due to wrong decision of mine.
[27:51] Maheen has come back now,
[27:56] it will all be fine now.
[28:00] No Mansoor,
[28:05] I have seen him entangled when Maheen left
[28:13] and I saw him suffocated
when Maheen came back.
[28:20] Seeing Maheen, I cannot say that
she came back because of Umar,
[28:28] she has come back because of his uncle,
[28:35] or for the world outside.
[28:41] Why do you say such hopeless things?
[28:52] Mansoor, I don’t want to disappoint Umar,
[28:58] that his father ruined his happiness,
[29:01] didn’t care for his happiness.
[29:06] Look, you and Najia,
[29:10] talk to both of them,
[29:16] ask them what they want,
[29:20] try to find out that
[29:24] is there space for each
other in their hearts or not.
[29:27] Mansoor…
[29:29] Ok. Ok. I will do it. I will do it.
[29:34] Okay,
[29:37] don’t worry, relax.
[29:42] That’s it.
[30:02] Here.
[30:19] Did your friend leave?
[30:20] Yes.
[30:22] You should have asked her to stay for food.
[30:25] Don’t worry Grandma,
[30:27] I sent her after caring for her a lot.
[30:31] But she came to meet Razia,
[30:34] why did she leave without meeting her?
[30:40] Look Maheen,
[30:42] this friend of yours looks suspicious to me,
[30:45] stay away from her.
[30:48] I will stay away from her,
[30:51] but grandma,
[30:53] you should also not talk about
family matters in front of her.
[30:56] I don’t want these strangers
to talk about my home.
[31:00] Now you are not as stupid as I thought,
[31:04] after all, you are our blood,
[31:07] but you are the one
who started this secret talk.
[31:10] You forgot?
[31:12] Grandma, ask your heart, can I do this?
[31:20] So this means, that girl was lying?
[31:24] But why?
[31:25] She has the answer for this why.
[31:28] But anyway leave it,
what had to happen, happened,
[31:31] we need to be careful going forward.
[31:37] You have become really smart.
[32:03] I don’t have a narrow
minded thinking like you, Roshni.
[32:07] To get a husband or in other words,
[32:13] to get a man,
[32:17] a person can pass any limit.
[32:22] to live your life you don’t only have husband,
home and in-laws,
[32:28] for me, other things matter too,
[32:31] like relations,
[32:33] faithfulness,
[32:34] trust,
[32:36] and friendship.
[32:39] And in the name of this friendship,
I came back.
[32:48] Umar is not just my husband,
[32:51] he is also my childhood friend,
[32:54] my partner since childhood
[32:57] and I will not let him get ruined at your hand.
[33:04] You had left him,
left him behind for someone else.
[33:09] You lied to him,
[33:11] and that poor thing,
[33:14] he didn’t lie, you did.
[33:16] He was not unfaithful, Roshni.
You were. You were.
[33:24] I am back,
[33:28] but not to get Umar,
[33:33] but to save him.
[33:53] Oh God, what will I reply to his questions?
[33:58] I didn’t even think of an excuse,
[34:01] how was I to know…
[34:18] You now prepare to go home.
[34:21] Thank God.
[34:24] Here.
[34:27] Mama is at home to give you company,
[34:30] she cannot have this diet food alone.
[34:34] Now you will have diet food
and she will too.
[34:39] Its fine, right?
[34:41] Yes.
[34:42] Made by Maheen?
[34:48] I don’t know.
[34:50] That’s fine.
[34:53] You go and do your work,
Mansoor is here,
[34:57] when you come back,
we will go home together.
[35:03] Okay.
[35:05] Thank you.
[35:13] I have been asking you for so long,
[35:15] let me shampoo your hair, brush it,
[35:18] I finally had to force you.
[35:21] You leave it, I will do it myself.
[35:23] Not at all,
[35:25] you will sit here peacefully,
[35:27] I will make your hair, then uncle will come.
[35:30] after that I have to go help out sister in law too.
[35:35] I feel really bad,
[35:38] that after Najia gave me such a big good news,
[35:41] instead of me caring for her,
[35:44] taking care of her wishes,
[35:47] I am on the bed myself,
[35:52] but these days you have really cared for Najia.
[35:56] Now I am thinking,
[35:59] when you leave, we will be in a tough spot.
[36:02] So don’t make us get used to your comfort.
[36:06] This...
[36:09] I am not going.
[36:11] I am not going anywhere.
[36:30] How are you?
[36:31] I will talk to you later.
[36:33] Bye. Bye.
[36:34] I am coming home.
[36:36] Fine. Fine.
[36:39] Yes Monis, come you can meet papa.
[36:47] Oh,
[36:49] no,
[36:52] I didn’t come here to see how you care for me,
[36:55] in fact, I will make tea for you and myself…
[36:56] No, no, leave it. Keep sitting.
[36:58] Even the doctor didn’t instruct me to sit so much.
[37:01] What do you want?
I sit here and do nothing.
[37:04] You  have to see mama too.
[37:07] Yes, so I just have to see her,
[37:08] what else do I have to do,
[37:10] we have a maid,
there is a washing machine,
[37:12] the home is cleaned,
[37:13] I just have to take care of the kitchen
and that is not much work,
[37:15] that is no work, if I don’t do that even,
then what is the benefit of me being here?
[37:18] You only came here to benefit us?
[37:20] No, there is another reason.
[37:23] Umar?
[37:26] I was going to the kitchen to make tea
and you got me talking here.
[37:30] Maheen,
[37:35] everything was fine between you and Umar,
[37:39] at least it seemed ok.
[37:48] Sister in law, just think I was being stupid,
[37:55] I was going to get a big loss,
[37:58] I listened to people and…
[38:03] now I am back.
[38:05] To fix everything and
[38:07] by the will of God it will all be fine.
[38:09] God willing.
