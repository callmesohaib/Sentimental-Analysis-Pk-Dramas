[00:21] Nabeel, I will talk to them tomorrow.
[00:25] But mama,
[00:26] please be careful of one thing you
will not be pressurized by uncle.
[00:30] You will have the final decision.
[00:32] what is wrong son,
[00:34] your happiness is my happiness,
I will make the decision you want.
[00:39] Hey, when will your mother come?
I have been calling her for so long.
[00:44] I spoke to her, but…
[00:47] But what?
[00:49] If she was here,
I would talk to her in detail.
[00:51] She wants that you go to her yourself and..
[00:55] No I stayed there for so long, I met all relatives,
I cannot go there again.
[01:13] why do you have a
long face on everything,
[01:16] if you want, I can talk to aunty.
[01:20] you will talk to her?
[01:22] Its my decision, I will talk.
[01:26] she knows us for so long,
[01:30] I don’t think she will say no.
[01:32] It’s true we are distant relatives,
but it’s the same family.
[01:39] but mama, I feel you
should ask what Roshni thinks,
[01:46] it’s important for her to decide too.
[01:49] What objection can she have.
[01:52] Roshni, you will live with us, right?
[01:59] trust me, I don’t have an issue if you
want to continue your education.
[02:03] If you want to go to an academy or
home tuition I can arrange that.
[02:11] Hey no, I spoke to Zubaida,
[02:14] she doesn’t want to study,
[02:16] so she didn’t study beyond Fsc.
[02:18] mama, I feel girls should complete
their education, right?
[02:22] Yes,
[02:23] I was thinking to tell Zubaida to stop
worrying about her wedding,
[02:27] we will find a good proposal
and marry her here.
[02:32] what is wrong?
Did you break something?
[02:35] Nothing madam,
I am cleaning up.
[02:41] what happened?
[02:44] The long face again.
[02:46] Okay, we will not marry
you without asking you.
[02:50] Fine, we will not fix your wedding
without asking you. Mama, you worried her.
[02:55] fine, I won’t talk about it. I was just saying
that I will talk to Zubeda that we took your responsibility,
[03:09] we will also fulfill the
responsibility of your wedding.
[03:12] Her burden will be reduced.
[03:14] We are not from the people who get money
and forget their old relatives,
[03:20] I am always trying
to help people out.
[04:28] I am going downstairs,
you sit here calmly.
[04:30] what is wrong Monis, sit please.
[04:33] Okay, promise, I won’t say anything,
you sit I will come soon.
[04:38] Come fast.
[04:39] Yes.
[04:46] Oh my child,
what sort of fate does she have.
[04:50] Did she regain consciousness?
[04:52] Yes, she is conscious.
Why do you curse your daughter's fate.
[04:57] We are here,
we will find a solution.
[05:15] if you cannot see me with love,
see me with anger.
[05:24] Hey Zeeshan,
when did you come?
[05:26] Tell me,
were you standing outside?
[05:29] Yes brother Umar.
[05:32] Did something come to the neighbor’s home?
A car, taxi, rickshaw?
[05:38] No, I didn’t see anything.
[05:49] What do you see?
[05:51] Brother Umar, it’s an assignment,
I need to submit it tomorrow.
[05:53] Yes, move, I want to lie down here.
[05:56] Assignment? Walk?
[05:57] come on move.
[06:02] We came number one cause of you.
[06:09] The weather is nice
[06:11] Its nice, for you.
[06:21] Brother Umar, you look worried.
[06:24] No, nothing.
[06:27] Just worried for
Maheen but all will be fine.
[06:31] Yes, I saw too, the Maheen incident.
[06:36] You know I have a
solution for worries.
[06:51] what is that?
[06:53] Nothing.
[06:54] Show it to me.
[06:55] Its nothing.
Give it.
[06:56] Brother Umar, it’s nothing.
[06:57] I will tell your mother,
she will beat you up.
[06:59] I swear its nothing.
[07:01] Give it to me.
[07:02] Will you get up or not?
Get out of here.
[07:05] Get out.
Give this to me.
[07:06] Brother Umar,
you spoil the mood. Man, damn it.
[07:09] You shut up.
[07:26] Weird people.
[07:58] oh God. My head hurts,
give me a tablet.
[08:04] one minute, let me check,
I should have it in my purse.
[08:15] Here.
[08:22] just gave her medication
and put her to sleep.
[08:24] In fact, the doctor gave
her a sedative injection.
[08:34] Everyone is worried for this.
[08:39] I feel we will be up all night.
[08:43] Can I say something?
[08:44] Yeah.
[08:45] Both their prayers
have a strong affect.
[08:48] See how it got answered.
[08:50] I don’t know if it was a
prayer or a curse.
[08:53] What? Curse?
[08:55] Yeah, did you not see Umar?
[08:58] He was so relaxed like
he knew this wedding won’t happen.
[09:05] God knows what magic he got done.
[09:08] Magic?
[09:10] Who are you talking about?
[09:12] Umar, why do you act so lost?
[09:15] Who else will try that this
wedding doesn’t happen?
[09:23] Umar?
[09:34] Such cheap people.
[09:36] Mama,
[09:37] I had told you not be hasty,
[09:39] but you wanted to get rid of Mahi,
like a burden on your head.
[09:43] Son, don’t blame your mother,
[09:46] what will that do?
[09:49] What mother wants bad for her daughter,
[09:52] she must have thought some good.
[09:54] But the actions for the past 2 months should
have made it easier to understand.
[09:58] I told her to break the engagement.
[10:00] How could I break it?
[10:02] The girl whose engagement is broken never gets married,
people take out faults in her.
[10:06] Talk about her.
[10:09] Zakia, what about the
threat they gave us?
[10:12] What if they don’t show up tomorrow?
Hadn’t the engagement being broken been better?
[10:16] what are you saying brother?
[10:18] Monis, you leave in the morning,
[10:20] sell this home,
put it as guarantee and get the car.
[10:23] I won’t do anything like this.
[10:25] Monis.
[10:30] Mama, it’s not that I am giving
the home importance over Mahi,
[10:36] I can give my life for her.
Knowing their reality,
[10:40] I don’t want my daughter
to go to those greedy people.
[10:43] So before they say
no to bringing the groom,
[10:46] you call them and say no uncle.
[10:50] What nonsense, Monis
[10:51] Today, when you talk about
putting the home at risk,
[10:58] and fulfill their wish, but when they make
more wishes again, you will have nothing.
[11:03] A greedy person is always greedy.
[11:07] Exactly, grandma.
[11:10] What will they do my sister,
[11:12] I can guess it.
[11:14] I cannot push my sister
in the well knowingly.
[11:17] Uncle, you call.
[11:19] Don’t be hasty Monis.
Let’s find a solution.
[11:24] what solution?
[11:27] Are you in favor of agreeing
to their unjust demand.
[11:31] we will find a middle ground.
[11:34] What middle ground?
[11:37] Monis is smarter than you.
[11:39] My child, my orphan child.
[11:43] She is to be married tomorrow.
[11:45] How do I tell them not to come?
[11:48] Who will we make believe that my
daughter doesn’t have an issue.
[11:51] The girl whose wedding is called off,
how will she get another proposal.
[11:54] What will we tell people?
People will say a lot,
[11:58] I don’t have the
courage to hear them.
[12:09] I don’t understand
where I am standing.
[12:16] I agree with Monis,
[12:22] but my mind takes Zakia's side.
[12:26] In either case the girl will suffer.
[12:37] there is another way.
[12:52] Umar.
[12:54] Umar?
[12:57] Mama, what will Umar do?
[13:00] what is wrong mama?
[13:02] What would Umar
know of this situation?
[13:05] leave it,
he will give weird suggestions
[13:09] You people don’t get it,
[13:11] those people are not worth giving
our daughter to them. Monis is right.
[13:16] They didn’t care for our respect,
[13:19] they left at the wedding time,
[13:21] God knows what they
will do when they come again.
[13:25] Mama…
[13:26] Fine, I heard you
and you are right,
[13:31] your own people cover you.
[13:35] Mourad is not there,
I am alive.
[13:40] My Farid will put his
hand on Maheen's head.
[13:50] why do we go to strangers
to marry my daughter.
[13:56] Farid, call them and
ask them not to come.
[14:03] As far as the guests,
[14:05] they can come and be part of
Umar and Maheen's wedding.
[14:15] mama,
[14:16] are you in your senses?
[14:18] How did you take
Umar’s name just like that.
[14:21] This is not possible.
[14:22] You remember, right?
[14:26] That you gave Umar's right to me,
[14:28] will you go against your word?
[14:31] why don’t you say something?
[14:32] We are talking about one thing and
mama is taking it to another direction. Is it a joke.
[14:38] Razia mama is not wrong and I think
there is no better solution of this problem.
[14:51] solution for the problem?
[14:53] Hey my son is a living being,
[14:56] you cant sacrifice him like this.
[14:57] I am telling you this cannot happen.
[15:03] Razia, listen.
[15:05] Listen to me.
[15:44] Farid, I am telling you this isnt possible.
[15:47] So don’t argue with me
and go and talk to your mother.
[15:51] I won’t let this happen
[15:53] so she should get quiet cause if
I speak her greatness will be shattered.
[15:58] you are stuck on it
cause my mother said it.
[16:01] What wrong did she say?
[16:04] Think calmly,
[16:06] what does Mahi lack.
[16:08] You always said that Mahi filled the
space of the daughter you never had.
[16:12] Yes,
[16:14] I consider her my daughter
but not my daughter in law.
[16:17] I have thought of things for my son,
[16:20] I have some hopes,
[16:22] how can I marry him to someone
cause a third person asked me to.
[16:26] I get him married quickly.
[16:28] not a third person,
[16:30] his father and grandma decided this.
[16:32] The other thing, your wishes are not
more important than someone's respect.
[16:39] As far as marrying
him quickly is concerned,
[16:43] that will happen,
you can fulfill all your wishes.
[16:47] Thank you so much
for giving me permission
[16:49] but I still won’t agree.
[16:52] Mama,
[16:55] Maheen really loves you,
you please agree.
[16:58] You stay away,
you are giving me suggestions.
[17:01] Mama, I am your son,
[17:04] Umar's brother, listen to me.
[17:06] I listen to Umar's brother,
[17:07] his father, his grandma,
why? Should I not listen to Umar?
[17:12] When you had to get married
you cared about no one and did what you wanted.
[17:18] What do you want now?
Umar gets killed without knowing,
[17:20] does no one care
about what Umar wants?
[17:23] Oh yes, I forgot about that.
[17:26] Umar's agreeing to it matters,
it’s a matter of his life.
[17:30] Yes, what do you want,
[17:32] is he an animal you can tie
him where you want?
[17:36] Hey, go wake him up,
[17:38] a storm has broken loose
here and he is sleeping.
[17:41] Papa, don’t need to ask him.
[17:44] why not?
[17:45] Only your husband had
the right to get married by his will.
[17:50] why don’t you say something?
Now is the time to talk about it.
[17:53] I am, wait.
I am telling her Najia.
[17:57] Papa, mama,
[18:01] Najia is right,
[18:03] don’t ask Umar.
[18:07] Umar, already…
[18:21] Razia will never agree.
[18:23] I don’t care,
[18:26] its Umar's grandma's decision,
she dare change it.
[18:30] Then my son is with me.
[18:32] Grandma,
[18:36] I don’t know why
[18:38] I don’t like all this.
[18:44] I mean, I love Mahi,
[18:48] but forcing someone
to marry her forcefully,
[18:55] no I cannot tire my sister like that.
[19:00] Stop it you,
[19:02] her mother and grandma are alive,
[19:06] don’t you dare interfere.
[19:09] What's forceful in this?
[19:11] Call Umar and ask him right now,
[19:13] he will agree.
[19:16] I know him well.
That is why I said it.
[19:21] Did he ever consider you and
Zakia separate from him?
[19:24] Will he be selfish right now?
[19:27] Will he hurt Maheen?
[19:30] Come on speak up,
why don’t you speak?
[19:48] This is his wish
[19:51] and both families had a feud,
he couldn’t say it,
[19:59] he was not worth it,
[20:02] but his heart's wish
is to be fulfilled now.
[20:14] Thank God
[20:17] I was thinking that
[20:19] I was going to do good with my
niece and do wrong with my son.
[20:24] Thank God.
[20:29] my son,
[20:31] he shared his sorrows and secrets
with someone who just came in.
[20:38] did he want to get beaten by telling you.
[20:41] the decision is done and there is the
call for prayers, now no one will say anything
[20:48] and you too expand your heart,
[20:50] the daughter in law is not as per your will
[20:56] but someone you like.
Mahi is just like the daughter you wanted.
[21:01] Let’s prepare for the wedding tomorrow,
[21:04] mansoor you help Umar prepare.
[21:08] Papa, can I give Umar this good news?
[21:11] Yes,
[21:12] you are the only one in the world
who can give him the good news.
[21:19] She won’t say a word after Umar agrees.
[21:23] She had issues in your wedding too,
but didn’t do anything.
[21:29] Hello.
[21:30] Hello mama.
[21:32] Roshni,
[21:33] I just woke up and saw 3 missed calls
from you in the night. All ok?
[21:40] nothing is ok mama.
[21:43] What happened?
[21:47] Nabeel and Shahista are good, right?
[21:49] Not good, they are not good at all.
[21:54] Roshni, you are worrying me,
[21:57] tell me what happened?
[21:59] You were so happy yesterday.
[22:01] I will tell you.
[22:02] I will tell you everything when
I get home.
[22:04] The first bus or train I get,
I am coming back in it.
[22:09] what? What are you saying?
[22:12] You will travel alone in the bus.
You have any idea how long a bus takes.
[22:16] Mama,
[22:18] whether the journey is long or short,
it will be painful,
[22:20] but I need to come back.
I am putting down the phone. Bye.
[22:25] Hello…
[22:30] God have mercy,
[22:32] God knows what happened.
[23:00] Umar.
[23:02] Umar,
[23:03] get up. It’s late.
[23:05] Let me sleep,
the light is so bright.
[23:09] What is the issue?
[23:10] Aunt has kept a morning meeting
like a villager, get to work now.
[23:16] No, you are safe,
[23:18] no one will make you work.
[23:21] Today is your day, in fact,
we are here to work for you.
[23:25] what is it?
[23:27] Why are you being sarcastic
in the morning. Let me sleep.
[23:31] because today the day
is important for you.
[23:34] why is important?
What happened?
[23:39] What are you looking over there for?
[23:42] nothing.
[23:44] Okay, get up. Shave,
[23:46] get up with me,
I will get you a haircut.
[23:48] Did you get good clothes or
that old jeans is all that you have?
[23:52] what is wrong brother?
[23:54] Why are you all of a sudden worried
about my shave, my haircut, my clothes?
[23:59] You are getting married today.
[24:00] I am your elder brother,
[24:01] if I don’t worry, who should?
[24:03] My brother should look like a prince.
[24:06] I will look like a prince.
[24:07] It’s not my wedding.
[24:09] On my wedding
I will look better than a prince.
[24:12] Hey, idiot.
[24:14] It’s your wedding,
you will be married soon.
[24:19] Is this a joke?
[24:21] I am not joking, it’s the reality.
[24:25] Come on, we are getting late. Come.
[25:15] grandma are you telling the truth?
[25:18] Yes, what else?
[25:19] He agrees?
[25:20] yes, he agrees. With all his heart.
[25:24] He says no to anyone
and he agrees to me.
[25:28] He likes Maheen too.
[25:31] Since childhood
he liked his aunt's home
[25:34] and now his fate
also got him here.
[25:40] thank God aunt.
[25:42] You know I had a burden on my heart,
[25:46] it’s been moved.
[25:49] Maheen is dear to me,
[25:51] Umar is like my brother,
[25:54] my friend.
[25:56] I didn’t want him to be forced.
[26:04] Grandma..
[26:09] Thank you.
[26:14] Thank you so much.
[26:20] Live long. Live long.
Let me go pray.
[26:35] The guests are the same,
why inform them again,
[26:41] don’t waste time,
[26:43] they will know when they come.
Take care of the rest.
[26:46] No, I wanted to say that Najia's family,
[26:52] don’t forget them, invite them. After all,
it’s her brother in laws marriage.
[26:59] do you see the time?
[27:00] A person looks at the situation and time,
we have the wedding and reception the same day
[27:04] and you are always caring for your in laws.
[27:06] I have guests too, Umar has friends,
we have neighbors, should we call them all?
[27:13] You surprise me. Hey, my son is up.
Come on get ready quickly.
[27:19] one minute papa, what is all this?
Me and Maheen?
[27:22] Hey son, come. Come.
[27:26] The decision was already made by God,
[27:30] we got a go ahead right now.
[27:35] I was worried yesterday,
I thought what would happen.
[27:39] But trust me all
His decisions are the best.
[27:44] But no one asked me.
[27:45] Let us ask you now.
[27:48] What will you wear on the wedding?
[27:49] You must have gotten your jeans
[27:52] You think this is a joke?
[27:53] Calm down. Talk slowly, Monis said
we shouldn’t force you in Mahi's matter,
[27:58] they won’t like it if they hear this.
[28:01] No one cares what
I will like or dislike,
[28:04] I could have a plan,
I could have something in my head.
[28:09] He is right papa,
let’s call the orchestra.
[28:12] Hey, don’t bother him,
we will do it all.
[28:15] Give way.
[28:16] There is no time right now,
[28:18] you can fulfill all your wishes once the wedding happens.
[28:20] You fulfill your plans. Come on take care of him.
[28:22] Come on man, look, there is still time,
[28:24] come shopping with me,
[28:27] get a sherwani or suit or what you like.
[28:31] Be quiet man,
[28:33] sherwani suit.
[28:36] It’s a one sided decision and that too hasty.
[28:43] I will talk to mama
[28:48] Useless dramas for no reason.
[29:04] Razia,
[29:07] I will never forget this favor of yours.
[29:10] zakia, what are you doing?
[29:12] if it was possible, I would put
my heart under your feet.
[29:18] I was going to throw my daughter in the well.
[29:22] Had you not supported us,
[29:24] we would have suffered all our life.
[29:29] You put a hand on her head and saved us.
[29:33] You are marrying him to your diamond like son.
[29:38] Umar
[29:44] may God give you happiness
[29:46] and give you a long life.
[29:50] You have always
made me happy Umar,
[29:53] I didn’t know the biggest happiness
of my life will come from you.
[29:58] First I was happy that I am going
to fulfill my daughter's duty,
[30:03] and now,
[30:04] I am satisfied I will see my
daughter happy all my life.
[30:10] Live long.
[30:13] Live long.
[30:16] Live long.
[30:30] Mama.
[30:30] Umar, be quiet now.
[30:33] Yes my heart was not convinced,
[30:36] yes I thought I wouldn’t stay quiet like
I did in case of Mansoor,
[30:41] but I don’t have a stone heart.
[30:46] Fine,
[30:48] my relation with Zakia is not as
good as two sisters have,
[30:54] she is my sister in law,
[30:56] but she is Maheen's mother,
[30:59] how can I not understand a
mother’s sorrow being a mother.
[31:03] All of you see aunt Zakia's sorrow,
[31:06] everyone is thinking of Mahi,
[31:08] everyone wants to do good.
[31:10] Someone think about me too.
[31:12] Umar,
[31:13] half my courage was gone,
with me hearing what you wished for.
[31:18] But if I didn’t agree,
[31:20] this would have happened.
[31:24] You think your mother is hurt,
[31:30] yes I was hurt,
[31:33] but seeing Zakia's tears
and the prayers you get,
[31:39] I thought even if I got a girl I liked,
[31:44] you wouldn’t get these prayers.
[31:46] How would your father be at peace?
[31:50] So what is happening is good.
[31:56] May you two always be happy.
