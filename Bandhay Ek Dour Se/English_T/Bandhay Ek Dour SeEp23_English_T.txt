[00:22] Oh God Roshni, stop it!
[00:24] You have been sleeping since evening,
wake up now. it’s enough.
[00:28] I am getting up.
[00:30] Your friend is here too,
you have to go meet her too.
[00:34] What is the hurry? I will meet her.
[00:37] No,
[00:38] you will not go anywhere tomorrow.
[00:40] Your uncle’s grandson,
[00:43] they have a party for him,
you will go with me.
[00:47] Mama,
[00:50] I will not go anywhere tomorrow anyway
and what about Maheen,
[00:54] she is there at her mother’s home.
[00:58] What?
[00:59] What do you mean?
[01:01] This means that she wasn’t able to get along
with her in-laws and not even her husband.
[01:09] What are you saying, Roshni?
[01:14] God have mercy.
[01:18] God have mercy, mama.
Get me something to eat, please.
[01:22] Yes, I will get something.
[01:25] Thank you.
[03:31] Hello.
[03:34] How are you Maheen?
[03:37] I am fine sister in law.
[03:38] I don’t find anything fine
between you and Umar.
[03:41] What happened that you packed your bag
and went to your mother’s home?
[03:46] What can I say sister in law,
[03:48] at time a person has to make decisions
that your heart doesn’t agree to,
[03:54] but the mind tells you that it’s okay.
[03:57] Maheen, you don’t make
such big decisions alone.
[04:01] You should have talked to me,
we are all your well wishers.
[04:05] In fact, you are like my younger sister,
what am I here for?
[04:09] So much happened and
you didn’t tell us anything.
[04:13] what a lot?
[04:16] A loot didn’t happen,
[04:18] its just that everyone made
something so small a big issue.
[04:22] You left your home,
[04:23] you left Umar and
you are sitting at your mother’s home,
[04:26] its not something so small, Maheen.
[04:30] Tell me,
what is the reason for not liking Umar?
[04:34] There is no reason sister in law.
[04:36] The situation in which we got married…
[04:41] we didn’t have time
to understand each other.
[04:45] What do you mean?
[04:47] What more do the two of you
want to understand?
[04:50] You did something so weird.
[04:52] At least you could have spoken to me,
I would have given you the solution for this problem.
[04:56] I would have given you such a solution
[04:57] that the problem would have solved
and there was no need to break the relations.
[05:02] Hello?
[05:04] Maheen, are you listening?
[05:06] Yes sister in law,
[05:08] I listen to everyone.
[05:11] Now tell me,
what is the solution for this problem?
[05:17] You will find out soon sister in law.
[05:22] Hello.
[05:23] Maheen?
[06:05] I kept on waiting for you on the roof all night,
[06:09] I thought you would be really worried,
[06:12] so you will surely come.
[06:15] I go to the roof to get worried
in peace in my loneliness,
[06:21] now I am lonely in my room too,
[06:23] so I enjoy my worries there.
[06:29] Umar.
[06:30] Yes.
[06:31] Umar.
[06:32] Yes papa, I am ready, lets go.
[06:34] No,
[06:36] I will handle the work,
[06:37] you will go to take Maheen and convince her.
[06:46] She has told me not to.
[06:49] You are not so obedient to your wife,
[06:52] that you agree to everything she says.
[06:55] Papa…
[06:56] One minute,
[06:57] she said and you agreed.
[06:59] What she said is your duty.
[07:01] Apart from that you do everything you want,
[07:03] you do what you like.
[07:06] I am surprised,
[07:07] you are laughing brother Mansoor,
[07:09] and papa, you are talking
about me doing what I want,
[07:11] if I wanted to do what I wanted…
[07:17] Umar.
[07:18] Umar, listen…
[07:19] Umar.
[07:23] Papa,
[07:27] have breakfast.
[07:28] I am not in the mood.
[07:35] What are you saying?
[07:38] Whenever Maheen has come, 
she has always praised her in-laws.
[07:42] Whenever I asked her how Umar
and her in-laws are with her,
[07:46] she said that they are really good with her.
[07:49] If they were good,
[07:50] she wouldn’t have here,
[07:53] she tolerated everything as much as she could.
[07:57] After all Zakia,
[07:59] girls say such things to their friends,
[08:03] they don’t bother their mother with it.
[08:06] No secret is hidden from my Roshni.
[08:10] Roshni told me that her in-laws torment her,
[08:16] Umar and his family are really arrogant.
[08:22] She is an orphan, their own blood,
[08:25] they should have cared a little.
[08:29] Okay Zakia, I will go.
[08:32] I have to go to a function in the evening,
[08:36] I heard Maheen is here,
so I couldn’t stop myself.
[08:40] Maheen is just like my Roshni.
[08:45] Zakia, don’t worry,
[08:47] I will go .
[09:05] Hey, are you in your senses Zakia?
[09:07] Your brother gave Maheen
the pocket money himself
[09:10] and I forced Umar to take Maheen for shopping
[09:14] and you are saying 
we were keeping an eye on her expenses.
[09:17] She has never got a dress made for any child
apart from those on the religious feasts,
[09:21] and she is talking now!
[09:23] Be careful what you say, Zakia.
[09:25] Call Maheen.
[09:26] Call her.
[09:27] Tell her to say all this in front me, 
whatever she has told you.
[09:30] There is a limit to lying.
[09:32] Hey, she is lying.
[09:33] Complete lies.
[09:35] Maheen is not such a  girl that says something wrong, 
she is the one who likes to fight.
[09:41] Okay, come on now, blame Umar for this too.
[09:44] Hey, Umar has never even talked
to Maheen in a loud voice.
[09:49] Hey, you mother and
daughter don’t even fear God.
[09:52] Wait.
[09:53] Wait Zakia,
[09:54] I am coming myself,
[09:55] I will teach you
[09:57] I will fix your daughter’s mood.
[10:00] God damn it, we did everything,
[10:03] we gave her so much
 and she let it go in vain.
[10:08] Do you hear that?
[10:09] God forbid.
[10:11] God damn it.
[10:13] Thankless mother and daughter.
[10:15] Did you see mama, how Maheen is blaming us.
[10:19] Let Fareed come,
[10:20] I will tell him everything.
[10:22] We did everything for her.
[10:28] Mama, these spices!
[12:03] Papa has sent me to convince you.
[12:09] So you came?
[12:12] To convince me.
[12:15] No.
[12:28] You forgot this there.
[12:40] I forgot a lot of things,
[12:43] send those things as well.
[12:54] You are asking for your things?
[12:59] What is wrong with you Maheen?
[13:02] Why are you running so fast?
[13:06] The family is already upset because of you,
[13:09] you just came yesterday
[13:12] and now you are asking about
getting your things back.
[13:20] The whole family will be after me.
[13:27] Everyone say that I am naïve.
[13:32] Even you don’t understand Umar.
[13:44] Did aunt agree to this decision of yours?
[13:50] No.
[13:54] Maheen, even my heart is not convinced.
[14:03] Why?
[14:04] Maheen, you have took an emotional decision,
[14:07] but you will be facing the most difficulty.
[14:14] I only have to answer my family’s questions,
[14:18] and they will forget in some time too.
[14:22] You are a girl,
[14:24] whose questions will you answer?
[14:27] You will have to face everyone.
[14:36] You feel that
[14:38] I will spend the rest of my life in regrets,
[14:43] right Umar?
[14:46] That is why your heart doesn’t agree.
[14:51] Because you feel
[14:53] that when you will separate yourself from me,
what will I do?
[14:56] No one else will make me theirs,
[14:59] I will live alone all my life, helpless.
[15:05] You have a lot of sympathy for me, right?
[15:09] Not sympathy,
[15:13] but…
[15:13] This is called sympathy,
[15:17] honestly,
[15:19] living with you,
[15:22] I have felt sorry for myself a lot,
[15:27] instead of being sorry,
[15:30] I would rather live a life of regrets.
[15:47] Zakia will tell everyone in the family, 
she will defame me.
[15:52] Hey, she didn’t think once
before taking out old enmity,
[15:56] that she is ruining her daughter’s home.
[15:58] Mama,
[16:00] I am sure there is some misunderstanding.
[16:03] What misunderstanding?
[16:04] I didn’t hear it from a third person,
[16:06] Zakia herself told me all the torment 
and trouble we have done on Maheen.
[16:13] may God curse the liars.
[16:16] I don’t understand
how Maheen can say all this.
[16:20] I am sure aunt is mistaken.
[16:23] This is what I don’t believe
[16:26] that Maheen fought with Umar,
[16:30] and got upset with us and left
and doesn’t want to come back.
[16:35] She was happy and smiling till yesterday.
[16:40] How did all of this happen overnight.
[16:45] She didn’t do good.
[16:46] You have this water.
[16:57] Get the tray.
[17:20] I don’t understand Maheen,
what has happened to you suddenly?
[17:26] Why do you suddenly not like me?
[17:30] Why do you have so many complaints from me?
[17:34] Whatever happened to me,
[17:36] I have never held you responsible for it.
[17:41] I never tried or had intentions of hurting you,
[17:45] I have always cared for you
[17:47] and wanted to treat you the same way
like I have since childhood, like always.
[17:54] I always wanted to keep you and Roshni,
both happy.
[18:04] Me and Roshni?
[18:05] Yes Maheen,
[18:07] I don’t want to see either one of you sad, never!
[18:13] You are my childhood friend and she is my love.
[18:16] You are dear to me and so is she.
[18:20] Umar,
[18:30] in love its either this or that.
[18:37] This too and that too doesn’t happen.
[19:08] Stop Umar, listen to me.
[19:10] Yes.
[19:12] You should be ashamed.
[19:14] You should be ashamed.
[19:15] I knew about mama,
[19:17] she never let her daughter in law be at peace,
[19:20] then how would she let her grand 
daughter in law live in peace?
[19:21] I knew about Razia’s temperament,
[19:24] she already hated me,
[19:26] and that Najia,
[19:27] she is a two sided sword.
[19:29] Still I sent Maheen to your home,
[19:32] only after trusting you.
[19:34] One minute, what happened?
[19:36] Okay,
[19:37] you will still ask me what happened?
[19:40] My daughter came back to her
mother’s home after being ruined.
[19:45] Then you ask Maheen why she came back.
[19:48] She came by her will,
[19:50] me, mama or no one else has
anyone else’s involvement in it.
[19:54] Papa sent me to convince her
and bring her back.
[19:58] Okay, convince her or threaten her?
[20:00] Aunt, why would I threaten her?
[20:02] I don’t know,
[20:03] but brother Fareed is always
 busy in convincing Maheen,
[20:07] But he does not make you understand,
[20:09] or stop Razia.
[20:11] He saw with his own eyes how 
she was being tormented and mistreated.
[20:16] What?
[20:17] What are you saying?
[20:19] What torment?
[20:20] What mistreatment?
[20:21] What are you asking her?
[20:23] You people consider her 
someone that doesn’t talk.
[20:26] An orphan girl, whose mother is a widow.
[20:28] Aunt?
[20:29] Look, listen to me,
[20:30] the sadness of my daughter
is huge for me, really huge.
[20:34] You make her do all the work at home,
that’s fine, but raising your hand,
[20:39] swearing at her and not a
single penny as pocket money.
[20:45] What?
[20:46] Mama, for God’s sake, be quiet,
what are you saying?
[20:49] Why? Why should I be quiet?
[20:51] He raises his hand on you,
his mother doesn’t give you food,
[20:54] puts restrictions on you,
keeps you deprived and I be quiet?
[21:05] Umar?
[21:07] What nonsense is this mama?
Why did you say this?
[21:09] When did I make these complaints?
[21:11] I don’t know what Umar must be thinking about me.
[21:14] Let him think what he wants.
[21:16] And what do you think?
[21:17] If you don’t tell me anything,
I won’t find out anything.
[21:21] Mama, this is not the truth.
[21:22] Okay,
[21:24] then you are mad that you left your husband’s home
and came to your mother’s home.
[21:32] Maybe.
[21:35] Maybe, I am mad.
[21:46] Oh God, these people have
made my daughter mad.
[21:48] May God question them.
[22:01] Umar.
[22:06] What is it? Speak up.
[22:08] What are you looking at?
[22:09] Only looking at you won’t make a difference, 
I will have to do something.
[22:14] What do you mean?
[22:15] What will you have to do?
[22:18] Look Umar, all this is not right,
[22:20] there is time, I am telling you understand.
[22:23] You are my brother in law later, friend first.
[22:26] I will beat you up so much.
[22:28] You are threatening me.
[22:31] I am in a bad mood already,
[22:33] don’t talk nonsense with me.
[22:35] Move back!
[22:53] Najia, make me tea, please.
[22:56] Hey, I have kept tea.
[22:58] Mansoor, listen.
[23:00] Yeah?
[23:02] The girl Umar wanted to marry
[23:06] and then we had a misunderstanding and we felt…
[23:10] Yes, go ahead, don’t give a speech.
[23:15] Does Umar still meet her?
[23:17] Why?
[23:18] Tell me, does he meet her or not?
[23:20] I am sure you know something.
[23:24] Look, I don’t know about him meeting her,
but, he is still in touch, I am sure of that.
[23:30] Yes,
[23:32] I have seen Umar talking on the phone secretly.
[23:37] What is going on in your head now?
[23:39] Not in my head, Umar’s head.
[23:42] I am sure Maheen got upset 
because of this and left home.
[23:47] Who can tolerate a second woman.
[23:49] Umar says that Maheen knew it all.
[23:53] that was in the past,
[23:54] now he is her husband and 
tolerating another woman is a big issue.
[23:59] Yes, its possible.
[24:01] and now Umar is trying to cover it up by saying
he doesn’t know why Maheen left home.
[24:06] Obviously,
[24:07] how will she tell herself that despite living with him,
 he is having an affair outside.
[24:12] Man, are you making tea or curry?
[24:16] You are only concerned about yourself,
[24:19] I will now tell everyone
what the real reason is, you will see.
[24:22] Hey, what is wrong?
[24:23] Najia, for God’s sake,
[24:25] our relations with mama have improved with
difficulty and don’t ruin it in your haste.
[24:31] Taking out results based on
speculation is something you do a lot.
[24:36] I will make tea myself.
[24:42] Listen to me.
[24:46] What was the need for mama to say all this?
[24:49] Mama did right.
[24:50] If I was in her place,
[24:51] I wouldn’t have cared about his and my relation.
[24:55] You are still not caring for the relation, brother.
[24:58] Look,
[24:59] I agree that the situation in which you and
Umar got married, these thing happen but now,
[25:05] Umar’s mistreatment is getting out of hand
and people are seeing it too.
[25:08] What are they seeing?
[25:10] What have you seen? Tell me.
[25:12] The way he got out in his anger,
[25:14] everyone would have seen it and
the locality makes the whole movie out of it.
[25:19] Look Maheen, my lovely sister,
[25:21] understand this,
[25:22] if you want to live your life with Umar,
[25:24] then you will have to make yourself strong
so you can respond to people.
[25:28] And you leaving home and coming here
is not a problem for us,
[25:31] but being quiet and sitting here,
thinking of that home, it will not sort the problem.
[25:41] Roshni, I cannot talk right now,
I will talk later.
[25:45] Why?
[25:46] Are you still trying to convince her?
[25:49] What is wrong Roshni?
[25:51] If you want, I can come, I can convince her.
I am talking about your benefit Umar.
[25:57] I am sorry,
[26:01] I am really angry.
[26:05] There is no point trying to make her understand.
[26:08] Leave it.
[26:11] I am going home anyway.
[26:26] Yes, no need to make her understand,
[26:30] whatever I wanted to say to her, 
and whatever I wanted her to understand.
[26:34] I have done that.
[26:43] What does Maheen say?
[26:45] Papa is going to come soon,
he will ask the same question.
[26:47] Everyone will ask,
[26:49] I will tell everyone together,
you too come to the party and hear it.
[26:55] You make a mistake and then misbehave.
[26:57] What mistake have I made?
[26:59] I feel,
[27:03] in fact, I strong believe that Maheen got
disappointed by your love and went back home.
[27:08] The love that doesn’t die even after marriage.
[27:12] You still meet that girl, right?
[27:13] Brother, she has an issue with me, not that girl.
[27:17] And before you blame me for everything,
[27:19] hear this, she has blamed us all,
[27:22] grandma, mama, papa,
me and you that we mistreat her together.
[27:31] And the reason you think is true,
why didn’t she mention that?
[27:36] What was the need to lie?
You tell me this.
[27:43] This is what I don’t understand,
[27:46] what was the need for her to say all this?
[27:48] I understand it,
[27:51] she hates me,
[27:54] she hates me a lot and
she will do anything to stay away from me.
[28:16] Why shouldn’t I have said it,
am I afraid of something?
[28:18] My heart is bursting hearing all this,
and you are crying why I talked to him.
[28:23] Mama, when I didn’t say all this to you,
then why did you say this to Umar.
[28:28] Okay,
[28:29] if you sit with your lips sealed, 
then should I also do the same.
[28:33] Would I not find out?
[28:34] What wrong did I say in this?
[28:36] Didn’t Razia make you do all the work at home?
[28:40] No.
[28:41] Okay, and you had no issues with your pocket money,
Umar had not stopped giving you money.
[28:45] There was no restriction on meeting people, right?
[28:48] No.
[28:49] Then why don’t you want to go back?
[28:51] If there is nothing out of this,
[28:53] then what is the real
complain you have from Umar?
[29:01] I have no complain.
[29:03] Okay, so you came to your
mother’s home happily, right?
[29:06] Or do you want your mother to worry.
[29:09] Mama, is it not enough that
I don’t want to live with him,
[29:14] I don’t want to spend 
the rest of my life with him?
[29:55] Umar.
[29:56] Umar.
[29:59] Yes mama.
[30:00] Umar, come out, we need to talk.
[30:04] My class is about to start.
[30:15] I am accepting from my heart,
that I was wrong.
[30:20] If kids marry out of their will, its better.
[30:24] Now, why this sudden confession?
[30:27] Look, I always got upset with Mansoor
that he got the wife he liked,
[30:35] now see no matter how Najia is with us,
[30:38] she is fine with Mansoor
[30:40] and parents want that their children are happy.
[30:45] She cares for Mansoor,
takes care of him, loves him,
[30:49] so much so that
she agreed on his second wedding.
[30:53] Okay, your wish has been fulfilled.
[30:55] Oh God, why would I want that?
[30:58] I just gave an example that
[31:01] she really loves Mansoor and Mansoor 
won’t get a second wife with her being there.
[31:15] Get me married again, I am ready.
[31:20] Wow, hear him.
[31:23] We have lost our sleep
in his worry and he is joking.
[31:27] You cannot handle one and you will get another?
[31:31] I am not joking papa,
[31:33] you people were just talking that if parents take 
the decision of their children’s wedding its not that good,
[31:38] but if children do it themselves its better.
[31:40] I am saying the same, give me a chance.
[31:44] You and your chances.
[31:46] Everything is not supposed to be taken as a joke.
[31:48] Should I take your dreams of a second wedding.
[31:51] Mama, what is wrong with you?
[31:54] You leave all this and tell me,
when is Maheen coming.
[32:00] How would I know when is she coming.
[32:04] You people go and bring her,
forcefully, and heating her.
[32:08] You have been blamed anyway,
[32:11] now show a demonstration of the same.
[32:15] I don’t care if she comes back or not.
[33:32] Hey,
[33:33] what is this discussion about a second wedding?
[33:35] Let him come again,
[33:38] I will beat him up so much,
[33:40] that he will remember the beating
he got in his childhood.
[33:43] He was joking mama.
[33:45] To hell with his jokes.
[33:48] We are a joke in the community 
and he is fooling around.
[33:54] Come here.
[33:55] Come here.
[33:58] What is it grandma?
[33:59] Tell me,
[34:01] Why did you mention of a second 
wedding in front of your parents?
[34:10] I am going. Bye.
[34:11] Sit, I will get breakfast.
[34:12] No, I don’t want it, thank you.
[34:14] Yes, the second wife must be waiting,
she will make him bread, he will eat it.
[34:22] Hear this,
[34:23] the taunts in this home never ends.
[34:26] Look at this,
[34:27] the wife has bothered him and
he is getting upset with his parents.
[34:30] What have we said?
[34:32] She didn’t fight with us and leave.
[34:37] Look Razia,
[34:39] Maheen is not a bad girl.
[34:42] Its her mother,
[34:44] she likes fighting
[34:47] and till Maheen is there,
she will make her go insane.
[34:52] But don’t worry,
[34:53] I will go there myself and
make Maheen understand
[34:58] and I will also fix the mind of that conspirator.
[35:01] Leave it mama,
[35:03] Fareed has told us not to.
[35:04] He said he will go today or tomorrow.
[35:07] Oh no, if he goes,
[35:09] he will beg them and
agree to God knows what.
[35:14] You go with him
[35:16] or else God knows what that
conspirator will make him agree to.
[35:20] Mama, you are right.
[35:22] Yeah.
[35:27] Fine.
[35:39] No one takes me seriously.
[35:43] I said something and everyone was after me.
[35:46] What was the need for you to talk about
a second marriage from now on.
[35:52] When would I do it, Roshni?
[35:53] Earlier you said that I should do it sooner its getting late
and now you are saying something else.
[35:56] If you talk about the second marriage right now,
[35:59] then everyone will react.
[36:00] She has fought and left home upset,
[36:03] everyone will think that you talked
to Maheen about the second marriage
[36:07] and that is why she left.
[36:08] Brother and sister in law feel that way.
[36:11] Yes,
[36:12] then talk about this
when everything gets clear.
[36:17] How will it get clear?
[36:19] When the final decision is made.
[36:22] When the divorce is done, then.
[36:33] Divorce?
[36:35] Yes, divorce.
[36:37] Look,
[36:38] till the time she is in your life,
[36:40] everyone will react this way.
[36:43] Once she leaves from your life,
[36:47] what can anyone do?
[36:52] What happened?
[36:55] Nothing.
[37:07] I am really happy,
[37:09] that very soon the two of us will be one.
