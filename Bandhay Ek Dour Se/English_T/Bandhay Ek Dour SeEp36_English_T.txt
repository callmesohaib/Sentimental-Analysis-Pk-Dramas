[00:46] Okay, then fine,
[00:49] I will come along with you,
[00:52] I will ask for the proposal later,
[00:54] I will insult her first.
[00:56] For God’s sake mama.
[01:00] Mama,
[01:02] then I will come along,
[01:03] her mother should be treated too.
[01:06] You people forgive me,
[01:09] I will go alone.
[01:11] I thought that a woman of the home would
come along it would have been easier,
[01:14] but your intentions…
[01:20] Uncle,
[01:23] I will come with you.
[01:31] Damn it!
[02:03] Umar, what happened?
You called me in such an emergency.
[02:06] Umar?
[02:09] Brother Mansoor, I have found
the answers to all the questions.
[02:12] The question that you put in my heart.
[02:15] I have found out.
[02:18] What have you found out?
[02:20] That I am not entangled in Roshni’s love,
[02:24] but in the promises I made,
[02:28] I don’t have fear of going away from her,
[02:33] I am afraid of the blame of being
called unfaithful and a cheat.
[02:37] I don’t wish to live with her,
[02:40] but I care for her.
[02:43] I feel that I made a promise to her,
[02:46] if I go away from her, she will take her life.
[02:50] I don’t love her.
[02:52] This is not love.
[02:54] This is just a burden,
[02:57] that suffocates me.
[03:00] Who do you love?
[03:03] Did you find the answer to this?
[03:09] The answer is in front of me,
[03:12] I kept on looking away,
[03:16] I used to feel ashamed.
[03:20] I claimed to love a girl,
[03:24] made her wait for me,
[03:26] then I fell in love with someone else.
[03:30] But brother Mansoor,
I cannot take it anymore,
[03:32] I want to get rid of this burden.
[03:37] Umar, I was waiting for this moment,
[03:41] go and tell Maheen
[03:44] that you have learned
the difference between illusion and love.
[03:52] How can I tell Maheen?
[03:56] What will she think about me?
[03:58] She knows everything about me and Roshni.
[04:01] She knows my madness.
[04:02] She will think that the things
I used to say to Roshni,
[04:04] I am saying to her.
[04:05] How will she believe me?
[04:08] Umar, you have wasted a lot of time,
in these ifs and buts.
[04:13] These useless misconceptions,
[04:16] don’t waste time in those,
[04:19] go and tell her.
[04:22] Should I?
[04:23] Yes, right now, this very moment.
[04:30] And Roshni?
[04:33] Its clear to you who you love,
[04:38] then also decide that
who do you care about the most?
[04:44] The one you decide about do think about it,
[04:50] that the one you care about, is she worth it.
[04:56] Roshni is not worth this.
[04:59] She is not worth it.
[05:02] I agree that her emotion is real,
she must love me,
[05:10] but the people I love,
[05:13] who are attached to me,
[05:14] if she cannot love them,
then I cannot include her in my life.
[05:20] Then go.
[05:22] Go right now to Maheen and tell her.
[05:27] Take out the fear from inside you.
[05:33] Go.
[05:39] Thank you brother Mansoor.
[05:41] Thank you.
[05:44] Thank you.
[06:47] What happened, papa?
[06:51] Is everything ok at home?
[06:53] Mama.
[06:56] What happened to you?
[06:58] Why are you crying?
[07:00] Someone tell me, what happened?
[07:03] We have fixed the proposal
and also the wedding date.
[07:09] After four days you
and Roshni will get married.
[07:26] What?
[07:27] So soon?
[07:28] You also fixed the wedding date?
[07:30] What sort of people are they?
They couldn’t tell us before coming.
[07:33] You knew when those people are coming,
[07:35] you should have stayed at home,
[07:37] but you cannot stay at home.
[07:39] They are weird,
[07:40] they didn’t even meet me
and nothing else,
[07:42] and my mother is the most weird,
[07:46] that is so tired of me that
[07:48] she met them for the first time,
and fixed the date of the wedding.
[07:50] They must not want to meet you.
[07:53] The way we are getting this
wedding done with a dead heart,
[07:55] they must be doing so as well.
[07:57] And you leave everything,
[07:59] you are happy,
[08:01] your wish is complete.
[08:03] Now what do you want?
[08:05] Should we dance over this defamation?
[08:08] Mama, there was no need to be so hasty.
[08:13] You failed all my planning.
[08:17] Right now I had to get
Umar agree to so much,
[08:19] make him agree to a lot of my conditions.
[08:21] Now how will I pressurize him
after the marriage?
[08:26] Roshni,
[08:29] I don’t see any signs of you
wanting to live in that home.
[08:35] Look,
[08:37] you have fallen in love,
[08:44] take your respect and leave.
[08:49] If this is how you will behave,
[08:52] you will come sit on this door.
[08:55] See this,
[08:57] come to your senses.
[09:49] Congratulations,
[09:51] today God fulfilled your heart felt wish.
[09:58] True love never loses.
[10:14] What are you acting about, now?
[10:16] You were dying to send the proposal till yesterday.
[10:19] What else?
[10:21] He has made such a face, like we are forcing him.
[11:13] Maheen.
[11:16] Yes, I am here.
[11:22] What happened?
[11:27] What was the haste to do all this?
[11:32] You were in a hurry,
[11:35] you wanted that all this…
[11:37] I wanted it?
[11:38] I feel you wanted it.
[11:41] Yes,
[11:42] I wanted it.
[11:44] I want it.
[11:46] Why?
[11:48] Why?
[11:51] Tell me.
[11:59] Because,
[12:02] I don’t want
[12:04] that I am blamed that I became a hurdle between someone.
[12:09] Because I don’t want you to think I forgot our friendship.
[12:15] You thought about yourself,
[12:18] not me.
[12:21] You want to sit on a tower of greatness
[12:23] so that everyone else comes across to you as small and below standard.
[12:29] This is what you want, right?
[12:33] What did I do now?
[13:40] Everything went wrong, brother.
[13:47] This matter got out of my hand.
[13:53] Nothing has got out of hand till now,
[13:57] how long will you keep what is in your heart, in your heart.
[14:03] Go and tell Maheen
[14:07] that your love she is her, not Roshni.
[14:16] Go and tell her to stop all this from happening.
[14:21] They will fix everything, you go and tell them at least.
[14:28] And Roshni?
[14:33] What is her fault?
[14:39] You are still worried about Roshni?
[14:42] Stop worrying about her. Think about yourself.
[14:44] Think about yourself and Maheen.
[14:57] Brother Mansoor, you know the condition in which I and Maheen got married.
[15:05] It was to save the respect of the family.
[15:11] So does Roshni not have a family?
[15:14] Does she not have a mother?
[15:24] I know I don’t love her.
[15:34] I have a lot of complaints from her,
[15:38] but we were together.
[15:44] Her poor mother has made preparations for the wedding.
[15:52] What is your problem Umar?
[15:56] You cannot do this.
[15:57] You cannot do that.
[15:59] What do you want?
[16:05] I can do a lot.
[16:09] I want a lot,
[16:12] but for whom?
[16:15] For Maheen.
[16:19] Who is happier than me on my proposal being finalized?
[16:22] did you see?
[16:25] What do I tell her?
[16:27] That I love her?
[16:32] Even though she doesn’t love me.
[16:52] And you are sitting here and crying, quietly.
[16:54] What can I do? Fight with her fate?
[16:57] Hey, my sister doesn’t have a bad fate.
[16:59] The one who has a bad fate is the one who is losing my sister.
[17:02] At least, I cannot sit here and see the show, mama.
[17:05] So, like you going there and asking questions will stop the wedding?
[17:09] Hey, let it not stop,
[17:10] my sister is not so low, that she falls at their feet,
[17:14] but I will not let Maheen stay there any further.
[17:17] Don’t do that, Monis,
[17:20] or else people will talk.
[17:22] Everyone will say what Roshni is saying,
[17:25] that Maheen herself didn’t want to live with Umar,
[17:27] so that she is on the forefront of his wedding.
[17:29] What respect will we have?
[17:31] Hey man, respect. Respect. Respect.
[17:33] Why will the burden of the respect of the family be on my sister’s shoulders?
[17:37] Does she not have a life herself?
[17:39] But I have decided,
[17:41] no matter what the world says,
[17:42] I will not let my sister’s life be ruined,
[17:44] I am going to get her.
[17:46] Monis, don’t be hasty, talk to Umar and your uncle, first.
[19:20] But Mansoor you had said…
[19:22] I was not wrong,
[19:24] what I thought was the truth, turned out that way.
[19:29] Umar accepted that he loves Maheen.
[19:32] Really?
[19:33] Did he really say this?
[19:35] Yes,
[19:38] but he took too long to say it.
[19:42] Or maybe you were too hasty.
[19:46] No, no,
[19:49] nothing has been lost yet.
[19:54] No,
[19:56] you cannot do this.
[19:59] I know you.
[20:02] When Umar doesn’t have the courage,
[20:06] then you are our father.
[20:09] Its your upbringing that Umar’s killing his heart and not being selfish.
[20:17] He had sympathy for Roshni, not love
[20:21] and now this sympathy is even more than before now.
[21:00] Hello mama.
[21:02] Hello.
[21:05] How are you?
[21:09] Why do you care?
[21:11] You go and prepare for your second marriage.
[21:15] Hey, if everyone is agreeing to what I said,
[21:18] then is everyone doing me a favor?
[21:22] What did I do?
[21:25] Am I a criminal,
[21:27] did I commit a murder.
[21:28] In my eyes, you have murdered,
[21:31] a murder is not just of a human
[21:33] its of relations and emotions too.
[21:37] You are a criminal and a sinner too.
[21:40] Don’t you dare,
[21:41] don’t you dare try to explain to me that the second marriage is not a crime.
[21:46] Islam has given permission for it.
[21:49] When you know about this, why would I repeat it?
[21:51] Okay.
[21:52] Then do one thing,
[21:54] get your father married for the second time,
[21:56] if you have permission,
[21:58] then he too has permission.
[22:01] What are you saying?
[22:03] Really?
[22:03] You are scared about getting your mother married for a second time,
[22:07] what about that girl?
[22:09] Did you think about her once?
[22:11] Did anyone think about me ever?
[22:13] What I feel or what I want?
[22:18] I came to convince you,
[22:22] but now I feel that no one will ever be happy with me all my life,
[22:27] and nor can I ever stay happy.
[22:29] Yes, yes, you will continue to cry.
[22:33] You will never be able to stay happy after your second marriage.
[23:05] Thank you.
[23:09] Tell me something,
[23:11] what do you talk to Umar till late night?
[23:14] Why don’t you tell me anything?
[23:17] There is no point in telling now.
[23:21] Are you instigating him to get married again?
[23:26] Why would I do that, Najia?
[23:28] I tried my best to make him understand,
[23:32] that he should stop.
[23:36] But…
[23:37] But what?
[23:39] Maybe he would have stopped,
[23:42] or stopped all this from happening,
[23:45] if Maheen wished the same too.
[23:53] If the one in front of you has already surrendered or someone gives up their right, themselves,
[24:00] then how can someone fight their battle for them?
[24:07] Fine,
[24:09] then, let me talk.
[24:12] I will break Maheen’s silence.
[24:18] Fine,
[24:19] give it a try.
[24:28] Hello,
[24:30] Umar, did you talk to your papa?
[24:33] No Roshni,
[24:35] there is no point in talking.
[24:39] Why is there no point in talking?
[24:41] Umar, I had told you earlier
[24:42] that I cannot live with people 
who don’t like me.
[24:47] You will have to live, Roshni.
[24:49] Everyone dislikes me too,
[24:52] but where will I go leaving them?
[24:54] Do what I have told you,
[24:56] get the top portion vacated, we will shift there after marriage.
[25:00] Umar, we will have to do this quickly,
[25:02] we don’t have a lot of time.
[25:04] This is not possible, Roshni.
[25:06] I cannot put my brother and sister in law out of their portion for my sake?
[25:11] Why is it not possible?
[25:13] Am I the only one left to make all the compromises.
[25:16] Look Roshni…
[25:17] I am doing you a favor, Umar.
[25:20] I am marrying you.
[25:21] Is this not enough that you want more sacrifices from me?
[25:28] What did you say?
[25:30] Favor?
[25:31] Yes, I am doing you a favor,
[25:33] you are someone else’s husband,
[25:35] I am accepting a distributed man.
[25:37] Your parents ruined your life,
[25:40] I am supporting you.
[25:42] Instead of worrying for me, you are worried for the world.
[25:45] This is the limit!
[26:19] Hey, you get your checkup done, regularly, right?
[26:22] Yes mama,
[26:23] by the grace of God everything is fine.
[26:30] You have to go alone,
[26:33] if I was capable,
[26:35] I would have taken you to the doctor myself.
[26:38] You will see,
[26:39] how soon God will give you health.
[26:41] Then whether it’s a grandson or granddaughter,
[26:42] you will play with him all around the home.
[26:45] God willing.
[26:45] You will see,
[26:46] God will get good times…
[26:48] careful child…
[26:51] I will play with him myself by the will of God.
[26:55] I forgot to ask you,
[26:57] that what room do we set for Umar.
[27:00] Obviously, we don’t care about Roshni,
[27:02] she can live anywhere, but Umar has to live with her,
[27:06] so we will have to think something for them.
[27:10] Why do you worry for him so much?
[27:13] He will get new brides often,
[27:15] so will we get him new rooms every time?
[27:18] To hell with him,
[27:20] he can live anywhere with his wife.
[27:22] No, I was just saying…
[27:25] I was thinking that you have become smart,
[27:28] but you are still stupid.
[27:30] What was the need to say this in front of Maheen,
[27:34] she would have minded it so much.
[27:36] Sorry, I will be careful in future.
[27:38] Sorry is not the solution for everything,
[27:40] think before you speak.
[28:41] I am doing you a favor, Umar.
[28:46] You are someone else’s husband,
[28:48] I am accepting a distributed man.
[28:50] Your parents ruined your life,
[28:52] I am supporting you.
[28:55] Instead of worrying for me, you are worried for the world.
[28:58] This is the limit!
[29:59] Why are you crying now?
[30:06] No.
[30:10] You may hide your tears,
[30:12] but your empty eyes tell everything.
[30:21] Why don’t you say that you love him?
[30:25] How long will you hide it?
[30:27] And him…
[30:29] if you hid it from him,
[30:32] at least accept it yourself.
[30:33] What acceptance sister in law?
[30:37] I am being embarrassed,
[30:39] because I am trying to show my ownership on someone else’s thing.
[30:42] Someone else?
[30:45] He is your husband
[30:47] and you should have made him realize this.
[30:51] You don’t make someone realize,
[30:55] they realize on their own.
[30:58] I realized it.
[31:01] And you don’t even ask for love,
[31:05] you get it.
[31:08] I didn’t get it,
[31:12] Roshni did.
[31:15] No,
[31:17] at times you need to ask for love,
[31:21] just like a prayer.
[31:24] If prayers are made with intensity and power,
[31:27] they get accepted.
[31:30] Look at me,
[31:32] the doctors said no to me after seeing all my test results,
[31:36] they told me it won’t happen.
[31:38] But what happened?
[31:40] God’s blessing won,
[31:42] you too ask for it once.
[31:46] You asked for something for yourself in your prayers,
[31:50] how can I ask for someone else’s thing?
[31:54] So will you live all your life with this burden?
[31:58] No,
[32:00] Umar’s love is not a burden on my heart,
[32:05] I am at peace,
[32:07] that to get him,
[32:09] I don’t have to take support of anything.
[32:12] Neither truth, nor lies.
[32:17] A person can pray to God,
[32:22] but not love from a man.
[32:29] This is not something you ask for in charity.
[33:26] Umar.
[33:32] Yes?
[33:37] I want to talk to you about something important.
[33:42] Go ahead.
[34:00] Speak up Maheen.
[34:01] Its Roshni.
[34:09] I have to tell you that
[34:11] I am shifting downstairs in grandma’s room,
[34:14] this room will be for you and Roshni…
[34:17] Stop it.
[34:19] Stop it. Stop it.
[34:28] What do you want?
[34:32] I asked you, what do you want?
[34:35] How many medals do you want on your shoulders?
[34:40] What do I do?
[34:43] What do I do?
[34:45] What is your problem?
[34:48] What do I do?
[34:50] I am asking you, what do I do?
[34:54] How much burden will you put on me because of your favor?
[34:58] Speak up.
[35:00] Speak up.
[35:42] I don’t have a daughter,
[35:44] still my heart is hurt.
[35:47] You always considered her your daughter,
[35:49] then how can you…
[35:54] Uncle,
[35:56] I wanted your permission.
[35:57] Yes, go ahead child.
[35:59] Tell me.
[36:01] Can I go to mama’s home for a day or two.
[36:05] But day after tomorrow…
[36:06] Yes child, surely.
[36:09] Go for a week.
[36:13] You will be able to rest
[36:16] and after all,
[36:19] we are much better now.
[36:21] Don’t worry about here.
[36:24] Yes…
[36:30] Thank you.
[36:37] After I return,
[36:41] I will shift to grandma’s room.
[36:45] Live..live long.
[36:50] I wanted myself that
she shouldn’t stay here on this occasion.
[36:55] But I didn’t have the courage to say it.
[37:00] Its good,
[37:02] she decided to go herself.
[37:09] Fine.
[37:10] Fine.
[37:13] Fine.
