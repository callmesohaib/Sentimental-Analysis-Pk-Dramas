[00:20] Hello aunt.
[00:22] Hello. I am making breakfast,
till then go sit with your grandma,
[00:28] maybe her anger will go down.
[00:31] I will help you,
[00:33] I will roll it and you can fry it.
[00:35] :No leave it, 
your grandma is already upset
[00:39] and she will say that I am making the
new bride work in the kitchen.
[00:43] Why would grandma say that?
[00:45] She told me herself that you have a lot
of burden and I should support you.
[00:51] Mama will never say that.
[00:54] Fine, if you want to work, then make tea.
[00:59] You know aunt, I can make bread. 
Really good.
[01:05] I know, I have had bread you make,
[01:08] or else Zakia has no flavor in her hands.
[01:10] I don’t know where you learned from.
[01:13] Fine child, if you are so restless,
tomorrow is Sunday,
[01:16] I will make you prepare sweets.
[01:18] Fine.
[01:20] Go to her now.
[01:29] Yes Umar,
[01:31] what did you think?
When are you taking Maheen out.
[01:36] Wow, is the honeymoon planned?
[01:39] No, no preparation but
I think tomorrow is a Sunday,
[01:42] leave for Murree in the evening tomorrow.
[01:45] What do you think?
[01:46] Yeah.
[01:46] No, I want her to prepare sweets tomorrow,
they will go after that.
[01:51] What is the hurry?
Let her be here for a week.
[01:53] Mama, I am in no hurry,
she came to me herself. Ask her.
[01:58] Why?
[01:59] Yes grandma, I asked her.
[02:05] Papa, I was thinking we will go in a week,
what is the hurry?
[02:10] Umar, the weather is really good there.
[02:12] Yes Umar, stay a day in
Islamabad with your uncle.
[02:17] There you go, she never misses a chance.
[02:21] Mama.
[02:23] I would suggest,
[02:25] leave Murree, 
go somewhere else,
[02:28] Naran, Kaghan, Hunza.
[02:38] Uncle,
[02:40] its Umar’s birthday day after tomorrow,
[02:43] we will all celebrate
it together and then go.
[02:51] Yes, you can’t enjoy the 
birthday outside home.
[02:56] Wow, we didn’t remember.
[03:00] Good the one who remembers is here.
[03:03] Nothing like that,
I am his mother, I remembered.
[03:06] I was just checking if someone
else remembers or not.
[03:39] Hello.
[03:40] The whole day passed and you didn’t call.
[03:44] I was unwell.
[03:48] What happened? All ok?
[03:49] I am not well and after all,
[03:52] I went to meet Maheen,
[03:55] so I had a weird sorrow in my heart.
[03:59] You met Maheen?
[04:01] Yeah.
[04:02] I went to talk to Maheen that
[04:04] don’t be afraid of me and not
to make you sad cause of me.
[04:10] Look Umar,
[04:12] I cannot see you sad and worried.
[04:17] I had thought
[04:19] when I would be part of your life,
[04:22] I will love you more than I can,
[04:25] but that couldn’t happen.
[04:27] So now I want that at least
Maheen keeps you happy.
[04:36] Happiness is not something you
can buy and give to someone.
[04:42] I made you sad,
still you are thinking of my happiness.
[04:49] I feel you spoke to Maheen,
that is why she was apologizing to me.
[04:59] Maheen apologized?
[05:03] Yes.
[05:05] Then maybe she realized that
[05:09] or maybe she didn’t
[05:12] or maybe still in her heart…
[05:17] I don’t know. Umar, I am unwell,
[05:22] I will just say that
don’t call or message me again.
[05:28] Forget me Umar. Bye.
[05:31] Roshni…
[05:41] I can never forget her.
[08:30] Maheen.
[08:32] Yeah?
[08:34] tell me something,
[08:36] how would you feel that
[08:38] I talk to Roshni right now?
[08:44] You wont like it? 
You would get upset at her?
[08:52] No.
[08:54] See, I knew it.
[08:56] I was telling her that 
Maheen wont mind,
[08:59] she has supported us,
[09:01] she knows the intensity of our feelings.
[09:32] You just stir the spoon.
[09:34] Its not easy for you to make 
sweets out of 7 kg. it’s a custom,
[09:37] so you need to touch it.
[09:41] Why are we making so much sweet?
[09:43] Hey,
[09:45] the locality, relatives need to taste it that 
the new daughter in law made this.
[09:49] That damned Najia didn’t 
let this moment come,
[09:52] she made plastic noodles.
[09:55] After separating the stove, 
she is still the same.
[10:02] I will send the sweets to Zakia too.
[10:08] You go and give it with Umar.
[10:17] I had told you,
[10:19] Maheen has no objection, 
you were being hesitant for no reason.
[10:23] Yes, so I will be scared.
[10:25] Maheen fights with you cause of me,
[10:28] I don’t want the peace of your home ruined.
[10:30] What peace?
[10:33] There is no peace without you, Roshni,
[10:36] I just want to make amends for what I did to you, 
the false promises,
[10:42] may someone else fulfill them.
[10:47] One second stop the bike here.
[10:49] What happened?
[10:53] What happened?
[10:54] First thing is that 
Roshni doesn’t like anyone
[10:58] but Umar and secondly, stop making false claims, 
along with false promises.
[11:03] You cannot see me 
become someone else’s.
[11:10] Only I have this courage.
[11:21] Roshni,
[11:24] you have a right on your life.
[11:29] I don’t want that you 
ruin your life cause of me.
[11:40] You really want to make me happy?
[11:42] Obviously.
[11:44] I want one happiness from you.
[11:47] Go ahead.
[11:51] Tomorrow is your birthday,
[11:53] I want to be the first one to wish you,
[11:55] face to face.
[12:00] Fine,
[12:01] I will come here at the 
same time tomorrow.
[12:04] Not the same time,
[12:05] I want to wish you first,
[12:08] before anyone else does it.
[12:12] Alright,
[12:14] you can call. I…
[12:16] I don’t want to call, 
I want to wish you face to face.
[12:22] Yes, Roshni,
[12:25] but how will you meet me 
at 12 am tomorrow.
[12:30] I can come to my roof
[12:33] and we have met before.
[12:36] You tell me,
[12:38] will you come to 
your in-laws roof?
[12:45] Yes.
[12:59] Okay then, this is his new 
habit of not picking his phone.
[13:04] He comes,
[13:06] I feed him sweets, 
then I make everyone else have it.
[13:08] I have to send the 
sweets to so many places.
[13:10] I don’t know where this boy is.
[13:30] Roshni, man,
[13:33] I was thinking that…
[13:39] meeting so late at 12 am,
[13:43] wont it be weird?
[13:45] I have not asked you to do anything 
you have not done earlier.
[13:49] We have met earlier,
[13:52] so why are you being a coward now?
[13:53] Its not about being a coward.
[13:57] Ahh,
[14:00] The situation is a little different, 
earlier it was my aunt’s home,
[14:05] now its my in-laws. 
I have so manners for that…
[14:11] Your wife is at home and 
you are sitting here with me,
[14:15] do you have no shame now?
[14:17] Roshni…
[14:20] You know what your problem is Umar.
[14:22] What?
[14:22] You are having fun.
[14:24] What fun?
[14:25] You have a new bride at home
[14:28] and you are satisfied that 
the old lover is with you.
[14:31] What nonsense is this?
[14:33] You are making stupid moves,
[14:36] did I not tell you that 
Maheen is now your wife,
[14:40] your home’s respect,
[14:42] you two start a new life, 
stay happy and don’t call me.
[14:47] Did I not say that?
[14:49] You said it. 
I know, you were saying it.
[14:52] But you never agreed.
[14:55] You said Roshni, 
I cannot live without you,
[14:57] I cannot consider 
Maheen my wife.
[15:00] If you cannot consider 
Maheen your wife,
[15:02] then why are you considering 
her home your in-laws happily?
[15:07] Okay, its not that, I am just thinking…
[15:11] The thing is, you want to 
keep both sides happy
[15:14] and you want me to take the blame of being the 
girl who doesn’t let you live a happy life.
[15:19] No man…
[15:20] You leave me once, so that I die.
[15:23] What are you saying?
[15:25] You know I will die leaving you.
[15:30] We will get separated once and die.
[15:34] You stay together like this, you will make me 
realize that you will be far for me, I will die daily.
[15:41] If you like me and don’t want me to go,
[15:44] then why don’t you listen to me.
[15:47] I should know that the boy 
who I gave up so much for,
[15:55] he has the courage to 
do something for me.
[16:00] You are right, I am sorry.
[16:03] Fine, whatever you say, 
when you say, 
I will be there. I don’t care.
[16:07] Serious?
[16:08] Yes, stop crying now? 
Why are you crying?
[16:11] You made me cry.
[16:13] You look good.
[16:15] Lets order something.
[16:38] Hummm, Delicious.
[16:41] The sweets are delicious.
[16:44] Here, take this, this is your prize.
[16:49] what is the need of this?
[16:50] Child, keep it, it’s a custom.
[16:55] Thank you uncle.
[16:59] Did you distribute it to the locality.
[17:01] Yes.
[17:03] Brother’s driver is coming,
[17:05] I am thinking of sending it 
across to sister’s with him,
[17:10] Umar is not home yet or else 
he would have dropped it.
[17:14] Hey, he should have 
stayed home on a Sunday.
[17:16] I am sure you sent 
him for some work.
[17:18] Why would I send him?
[17:21] Hey, Umar is here. Umar.
[17:27] Hello.
[17:28] Hello. Live long.
[17:31] Ask him mama if 
his mother sent him.
[17:36] Where were you?
[17:39] Papa, I had some work.
[17:42] On a Sunday.
[17:44] My friend had some work.
[17:46] You always help friends, 
but never your family.
[17:49] You knew we had to 
make sweets today,
[17:52] I had to distribute it at a 
lot of places alone.
[17:54] Mansoor is sitting with a 
nail in his back from his wife.
[17:58] He is unable to move. 
I had to go alone.
[18:07] Where are you going now?
[18:09] The custom was that 
Umar had the first bite,
[18:12] go child get a spoon.
[18:16] What is wrong Razia?
[18:18] He must have gone somewhere,
[18:19] you know all his friends.
[18:28] He stays out half the day,
[18:30] doesn’t pick up his phone.
[18:31] Don’t I have this much right being 
his mother that I can ask him.
[18:36] Its not about asking, 
its about asking again 
and again that I stopped you.
[18:39] He is your young son,
[18:40] now will he update you 
on everything when he goes.
[18:43] Wow,
[18:44] you are really liking 
him all of a sudden,
[18:47] you used to question him 
so much if he was late by 2 minutes.
[18:51] It was different earlier, 
he is married now.
[18:56] Its not nice to scold him in 
this tone in front of his wife.
[19:00] Wow, Mr. Fareed, wow,
[19:03] you even in this age still get 
scolded in front of your mother,
[19:07] not just in front of your wife, 
but even your children.
[19:10] I am a mother and only your 
mother doesn’t have rights,
[19:13] so do I.
[19:15] Fine, you fight the 
battle of your rights,
[19:17] whatever I say, 
just pin it on my mother.
[19:20] I am right,
[19:21] earlier he didn’t used to 
get up before 2 pm
[19:24] and he went away after getting ready at 10 am, 
even after I stopped him.
[19:27] On his way back, should I not even question him. 
This is a weird restriction.
[19:44] How did you like it?
[19:45] Yes,
[19:47] its good.
[19:48] Okay stop,
[19:49] when I used to cook earlier, you used to 
have problems that its really bad,
[19:53] its half cooked, its over cooked, that is how 
I know you liked it. Now you say you like it.
[19:58] I know the food my mother cooks.
[20:02] Aunt didn’t make it.
[20:05] She told me the method,
[20:06] so it tastes the same, but I made it.
[20:13] Okay look,
[20:15] I got a prize for making sweets.
[20:20] That’s good.
[20:27] Did you go to meet Roshni?
[20:33] Okay, aunt was saying that the sweets are good, 
so we can drop it at mom’s too.
[20:40] But you came so late,
[20:43] I thought I would call brother 
Monis, he will pick it up.
[20:47] So, lets drop it.
[20:50] At this hour?
[20:52] Tomorrow.
[20:53] Not tomorrow,
[20:56] lets go today Maheen.
[21:01] In fact, lets do one thing, 
we will stay there overnight.
[21:06] Stay there?
[21:09] I don’t have such a program.
[21:12] Look, what is the time?
[21:15] Its 9 pm,
[21:16] when will we go and when will we come back? 
So, lets stay there.
[21:19] But,
[21:20] its your birthday tomorrow.
[21:22] We will come back in the morning.
[21:24] How can we go like this?
[21:26] Aunt will get upset. 
We will take it tomorrow.
[21:29] You tell her, I said it.
[21:32] Why are you saying it?
[21:35] You want to meet Roshni?
[21:41] What sort of a question is this?
[21:43] If I had to see her, 
I would go and meet her,
[21:46] I wont say all this for you. 
I am saying this for you.
[21:50] If you are saying this for me,
[21:54] then I don’t want to stay there at night.
[21:56] Fine, then don’t ask me to go there again.
[22:10] Listen,
[22:14] cant you do this for me?
[22:33] I will go get ready.
[22:41] I came to meet her and she is not here.
[22:44] Yes, she said she was coming.
[22:46] I will ask Monis to call and ask.
[22:49] Listen aunt,
[22:51] did they not make her 
make sweets too soon?
[22:55] I mean what was the hurry, 
they are weird people,
[22:58] they should have cared for 
their daughter in law a little.
[23:01] You know, 
your sister in law,
[23:04] she looks like someone strict to me.
[23:07] Yes, she is,
[23:09] but I know my girl too,
[23:11] I am sure she created a scene when 
she went there. She cannot sit like that.
[23:16] I am sure she wanted to 
care for the home immediately.
[23:19] She can do that later, 
she should care for her husband first.
[23:23] I mean aunt, this is the time
[23:26] when the husband and 
wife get to know each other,
[23:28] stay happy, spend time.
[23:30] If she gets involved in the work at home, 
this time will pass.
[23:34] This is great, 
how much more will she know Umar?
[23:38] They have spent childhood together,
[23:40] they were close friends.
[23:43] To be honest, my heart is at 
peace that she is with Umar,
[23:47] our Umar.
[23:54] Aunt, I will go home,
[23:56] I have to help mama, 
there is a lot to do.
[24:00] Bye.
[24:02] Bye. Come when Mahi comes.
[24:04] Yes.
[24:05] How did you make this 
plan all of a sudden?
[24:08] To stay overnight?
[24:10] Actually its taking so long to go,
[24:13] that we will get really late coming back, 
so we thought we would stay there.
[24:17] Umar has to go to 
work in the morning
[24:20] Yes, we will leave 
first thing in the morning.
[24:23] What is the great thing 
being distributed at night that
[24:27] you people have to gather it.
[24:29] Mama,
[24:30] I took permission from papa. Come on Maheen.
[24:33] Yes, he would allow you,
[24:36] did you come here to show your face for an hour?
[24:40] Your friends took the whole day
[24:43] and now you will be staying at 
your in-laws cause your wife asked you.
[24:47] Mama, nothing like it, you are saying this 
without any proof. Its not her wish,
[24:50] I asked her myself. 
I have some work with Monis.
[24:54] You have a lot of work nowadays.
[24:57] What can Monis help you with?
[24:59] Why? Can Monis not help me out.
[25:03] Why are you standing?
[25:04] Get the clothes and the bag too. Go.
[25:12] What are you looking at me for?
[25:14] You people have decided,
[25:16] and you got permission from his father.
[25:19] You just had to inform me, 
as a custom, so leave now.
[25:30] I know it all,
[25:31] he will take him mother and brother in law 
and go out for his birthday dinner.
[25:36] Like we are not related.
[25:38] You will see their face 
and celebrate your birthday.
[25:41] Well done.
[25:42] We brought you up and you will go 
celebrate your birthday with your in-laws.
[25:47] We are not related.
[25:49] Man, you uselessly say…
[26:02] You people made me wait for so long,
[26:04] I thought you people might not come.
[26:06] Its really late.
[26:08] Yes, we came late and 
you will have to pay for it.
[26:13] We will stay overnight.
[26:15] You are welcome, most welcome. 
You will stay too.
[26:19] Yes.
[26:19] Wow.
[26:22] Let me call Monis 
and ask him to come back.
[26:24] If he had known you would come over and stayed, 
he would never have left.
[26:28] You call him.
[26:31] Its ok, I will call him, he will come.
[26:34] No,
[26:35] what do we know of his plans, 
God knows when he will come
[26:37] and you will get bored here. 
Me and her will sit and talk.
[26:42] He will also sit and talk.
[26:46] He wont get bored.
[26:49] Right?
[26:54] You made this?
[27:13] This is the start, 
see what happens next.
[27:16] Now he will celebrate 
Eid there too at his in-laws.
[27:20] She took him with her, 
she didn’t even think that I am a mother,
[27:24] don’t I feel like kiss my son’s 
forehead on his birthday and pray for him.
[27:30] He will be back in the morning,
[27:32] you can kiss his forehead, pray for him.
[27:35] The day is to start.
[27:37] But mama,
[27:39] she has shown her right,
[27:41] that she has the most right on Umar,
[27:44] she will congratulate 
him first for his birthday.
[27:48] The new year of my son’s life will start,
[27:51] she will be there, we wont.
[32:19] Happy birthday to you.
[32:24] Happy birthday to you.
[32:34] Happy birthday.
[32:36] Thank you.
[32:39] Cut It with me.
[32:41] Its your birthday, how can I cut it?
[32:44] I cannot cut it without you.
[32:49] Happy birthday to you.
[33:02] Hummm,
[33:05] Here, first you.
[33:06] No, you first.
[33:07] You first.
[33:07] No…
[33:19] Thank you
[33:26] for giving me these moments.
[33:30] I will always have this in the 
treasure of my memories,
[33:35] because I only have memories.
[33:41] I don’t have you,
[33:44] nor you will ever be.
[33:48] Please Roshni, don’t say that.
[33:56] I am still yours like I was before.
[34:05] I love you Roshni.
[34:09] When I see you,
[34:11] I forget everything.
[34:15] A little more.
[34:17] Errr…
[34:18] You will have to eat a little more.
[34:21] I feel…
[34:23] I made it myself?
[34:24] Yeah.
[34:24] No, I didn’t make it myself.
[34:26] Hey, you are only feeding me.
[34:43] There you go, he cut the call again.
[34:45] Again?
[34:46] It would have been better had I not called.
[34:49] Give your beloved some shame.
[34:51] He cant even tolerate someone 
coming between him and his wife.
[34:55] Even if it’s the grandma or mother.
[34:59] Shameless, idiots. 
Him and Mahi too.
[35:03] They got the grandma get 
insulted in front of Razia.
[35:08] Its all Zakia’s doing.
[35:12] The way she is, what she did, 
she has taught the same to her daughter.
[35:35] Mahi, you? Mama didn’t tell me.
[35:39] Humm,
[35:41] I told her not to, 
I wanted to surprise you.
[35:44] Did Umar come or did 
he drop you off and leave?
[35:47] He is here too.
[35:48] That’s surprising,
[35:50] it’s a great surprise.
[35:51] Had you told me, I wouldn’t have gone 
to watch a movie with my friends,
[35:54] I would have taken 
Umar along. Umar.
[35:56] He…
[35:58] he didn’t feel sleepy, 
so he is upstairs on the roof.
