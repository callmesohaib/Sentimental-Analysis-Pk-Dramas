[00:21] What was the need to say this to mama?
[00:25] I had to say it, so I said it.
[00:30] We had decided
[00:34] that we would stay with each other,
[00:36] whether complete or incomplete.
[00:41] A lot of people live with us in this home,
apart from us.
[00:45] You cannot ignore their wishes.
[00:48] Najia, its not in my hands to fulfill their wishes.
[00:53] You too don’t have the right to,
[00:54] or without asking me give
them this permission about me.
[01:00] Mansoor,
[01:02] I just gave her permission
so that she doesn’t feel that
[01:07] I am a hurdle in this route
[01:10] that wants to stop your life
from being complete.
[01:16] Now its her decision whether
she does this or not,
[01:21] or whether you support her
in this decision or not.
[01:24] I did my work
[01:27] and maybe with the belief that
[01:30] me giving permission or
not doesn’t matter,
[01:34] you won’t agree.
[01:39] Najia, you put the thought in her head,
[01:43] now she will pressurize me for no reason.
[01:47] It was a debt on me.
[01:50] Mansoor, she is your mother,
[01:52] whatever she does for you,
you can take it as your right.
[01:58] But being my mother in law,
she thought something for me,
[02:04] then it was compulsory
for me to say all this.
[02:47] Umar.
[02:51] I am going to my mother’s home.
[02:57] No,
[02:59] I…
[03:00] I didn’t come here to ask you to drop me,
[03:04] I know you don’t like going there,
[03:08] I will ask Monis to pick me.
[03:14] You came from there yesterday only,
[03:16] if you go again, my mother will get upset.
[03:20] Let her be upset.
[03:29] Oh, so now my mother being
upset doesn’t matter to you.
[03:32] All the obedience was temporary?
[03:34] Everything was temporary,
[03:38] not strong enough,
[03:46] I am going to my home forever.
[04:02] What is the point of going to her
mother’s house every day?
[04:05] And look at her manners,
[04:07] she is not taking my permission,
[04:08] she is informing me,
[04:10] that too while standing,
[04:11] that I am going to my mother’s place.
[04:13] I asked why,
[04:14] she didn’t answer and went inside.
[04:17] She is newly married,
girls get sad for their mother’s home.
[04:21] What do you mean the heart gets sad?
[04:24] Isn’t a month enough.
[04:26] After all, there is no custom that
allows you go to your mother’s home daily.
[04:31] I will talk to Umar, he has been lenient.
[04:33] Leave it Razia,
[04:35] let her go right now,
talk to her calmly later.
[04:38] I wish you were as lenient in my matters as you are
in the matters of your sons and daughter in laws.
[04:44] I was only allowed to go once in a month,
[04:47] after a lot of requests and pleading.
[04:50] Okay, I will remove this
complaint of yours today.
[04:54] Since you start competing with
mama’s behavior on everything,
[04:58] I am being this lenient for you.
[05:01] I break this rules for you.
[05:05] So many years have passed,
you have not forgotten this,
[05:08] the sorrow of your heart has not left,
[05:10] that mama was a tough mother in law for you.
[05:13] You complain about it daily,
mention it ten times during the day.
[05:18] What do you want Razia?
[05:21] That your daughters in law
also mention you the same way in future,
[05:25] like you mention mama?
[05:55] Why are you doing all this now?
[05:57] Now Roshni has left from between us.
[06:01] Yes,
[06:02] she has left from between us,
[06:06] but there is nothing between us,
[06:09] just like before.
[06:11] So what is the point of living 
with this empty relation?
[06:17] You know why Roshni left from between us?
[06:21] So that I can be at peace,
[06:23] whether I get love or not
[06:25] and when you leave from here,
[06:27] won’t my peace be ruined?
[06:29] What will I say to the family?
[06:31] What will I say when they question me?
[06:34] Say that she is not happy
[06:36] and doesn’t want to live with you.
[06:37] You can say all this nonsense to them yourself.
[06:41] I will.
[06:41] Listen, are you really not happy?
[06:48] No,
[06:50] I am not happy,
[06:53] I am not happy.
[06:55] When Roshni was there and
 you would have done all this,
[06:57] it would have made sense.
[06:59] Why are being dramatic now?
[07:01] What is the problem?
[07:02] Why are you not happy?
[07:04] Because my happiness is not dependent on her,
[07:07] or anyone.
[07:10] Whether she is here or not,
 it doesn’t matter to me,
[07:14] I am not happy.
[07:16] Not with you, nor with this wedding.
[07:19] Nothing had changed
 with Roshni living here.
[07:25] So I am the real problem and me
[07:28] and Roshni kept on thinking
 that if she leaves my life,
[07:33] then we will be able to live a happy life.
[07:37] We might have spent a happy life.
[07:40] Maybe we could live a happy life
[07:45] if there was love.
[07:49] That you don’t have for me.
[07:54] And maybe we would have been 
able to survive if I had loved you,
[08:09] that I don’t have so we cannot survive.
[08:16] You are so selfish Maheen.
[08:19] So selfish.
[08:23] I have seen this side 
of you for the first time.
[08:27] I didn’t know you could do this.
[08:29] You know why Roshni did all this?
[08:32] For me.
[08:33] So that I am not blamed,
[08:35] so that I don’t have any burden.
[08:39] I know this is my battle 
and I will fight it alone.
[08:44] Look at you,
[08:45] what are you doing?
[08:47] There is so much difference
 between you and Roshni.
[08:55] I am not as great as Roshni,
[09:00] but I am not that selfish either.
[09:05] Look here,
[09:07] I am still your friend, I am Maheen.
[09:13] I won’t leave you in trouble and leave like this.
[09:17] Listen to me,
[09:19] if anyone asks questions,
I will answer them.
[09:24] If someone asks you,
[09:27] say that Maheen is a bad person,
[09:29] she was not happy,
[09:31] she wanted to go,
[09:35] she didn’t want to live with me.
[09:37] What?
[09:37] But to do all this,
[09:41] I will have to go from here.
[09:44] Look,
[09:47] By calling Monis will create a problem, 
so please, drop me yourself.
[09:54] Now…
[09:56] now, what does the promise you 
made to Roshni mean?
[10:04] I just…
[11:10] Maheen, where are you taking 
such a huge suitcase and going?
[11:13] Do you intend on staying there 
for a week or ten days?
[11:15] You were saying you 
are only going to meet them.
[11:19] I had told you, I am going.
[11:25] Why did you pack so much stuff?
[11:28] How long will you stay at your mother’s home for?
[11:30] This Zakia calls you all the time,
[11:33] if there is so much problem,
[11:35] then she should come here and meet you.
[11:38] You please be quiet mama.
[11:41] You go.
[11:43] But…
[11:44] Stop it Razia.
[11:46] Come soon, child.
[11:50] Come Maheen, we are getting late.
[11:54] Bye.
[11:55] Bye.
[12:18] She came back just yesterday.
[12:20] So what?
[12:22] Its her mother’s home, 
she can come whenever she likes.
[12:24] Its good,
[12:26] I had asked her that when she comes this time, 
she should stay for two or four days.
[12:29] Now both mother and daughter 
will shop for your wedding.
[12:32] But mama, suddenly?
[12:37] Actually Maheen said 
something weird with me,
[12:40] I ignored it considering it her naivety,
[12:43] that she may be doing it to
 test her brother’s love.
[12:47] But now that I remember it,
[12:53] my heart worries.
[12:56] Why? What did she say?
[13:00] Nothing.
[13:01] It is possible it’s my superstition.
[13:03] She is coming right now, 
we will ask her.
[13:05] I just hope to God
 that it is my superstition.
[13:24] What do you think, Maheen?
[13:26] Leaving the home like this, 
it will all end?
[13:29] And when you get to your mother’s home,
[13:31] will aunt Zakia agree easily when you say 
that you want to go to my in-laws,
[13:35] will she allow you that you don’t go?
[13:38] She cannot force me.
[13:40] And when mama and papa find out 
and come to convince you,
[13:43] what will you do?
[13:44] Will you say no?
[13:45] Won’t agree?
[13:47] When you have to agree, 
what is the point of creating this scene?
[13:49] I won’t agree,
[13:53] you don’t worry.
[14:01] You hate me so much?
[14:05] No,
[14:06] not at all.
[14:08] Then?
[14:12] Umar,
[14:13] the reason for not living with someone
 is not that you don’t hate them,
[14:20] love needs to be there too.
[14:24] I don’t hate anyone in this world, 
so what do I do?
[14:29] Marry the whole world?
[14:41] I am not able to understand you Maheen.
[14:43] Okay, this is another 
reason for no living with you.
[14:51] We were not able to understand each other,
[14:54] loving is a different story.
[14:58] And if a person doesn’t understand another,
[15:01] how will they make a place in their heart?
[15:35] Hello.
[15:37] Didn’t Umar come?
[15:39] No, he left, he had some work.
[15:43] He has been working a lot after the wedding.
[15:45] Is everything alright?
[15:46] You people forcefully put 
a responsibility on him.
[15:51] What do you mean?
[15:53] Listen, what you just said and left, 
I understand it all.
[15:56] I mean, he doesn’t have this much time
 to sit with us for a while.
[16:00] Fear God,
[16:01] you are taking it wrong.
[16:03] After marriage a person changes,
[16:05] there are a hundred things to do,
 ten responsibilities.
[16:08] You too are getting married,
[16:10] I will ask you later how many 
times you go to your in-laws.
[16:13] My in-laws are there, across the street
[16:15] and if I had gotten a chance to stay there,
[16:18] I would have definitely gone.
[16:19] But this is Umar’s in-laws later,
uncle’s home first.
[16:22] I mean, after wedding has he stopped 
giving importance to his in-laws.
[16:25] Earlier we used to be his aunt’s family.
[16:28] Remind him this.
[16:29] You are thinking too much.
[16:31] I don’t think too much.
[16:32] The size of your bag tells me, 
you didn’t come back happily from there.
[16:37] Where is mama?
[16:39] she went to Fazeela’s home.
[16:40] Her mother is planning 
a feast for you and Umar,
[16:42] but I called and told her not to,
 I made an excuse.
[16:45] You won’t tell me 
what is going on between you and Umar.
[16:48] When there is something to tell, 
I will tell you.
[16:51] I am going inside.
[17:20] Hello.
[17:22] Umar,
[17:24] I have explained to you,
[17:26] not to call or message me again.
[17:30] Forgive me.
[17:31] Roshni, I have to meet you.
[17:36] Look Umar,
[17:37] I have closed all doors of my return,
[17:41] and I have not been able to explain 
myself properly till now and you…
[17:45] You listen to me.
[17:46] Maheen has left,
[17:49] she has left me and gone to her home.
[17:51] Forever.
[17:53] She has left my home 
and my life completely.
[17:56] What?
[17:58] What are you saying Umar.
[18:01] She has left?
[18:02] When you meet me I will tell you.
[18:04] Okay,
[18:05] I will meet you then.
[18:07] Okay fine.
[18:29] What are you saying Maheen?
[18:32] Maheen, I am asking you something.
[18:36] I told you, I won’t go back there.
[18:40] Why?
[18:41] What happened?
[18:42] Tell me at least, what happened there?
[18:44] Did Razia say something or,
[18:45] what is her name, Najia your sister in law, 
did she say something?
[18:49] Tell me.
[18:50] I will handle them all, 
your mother is still alive.
[18:53] You are my mother,
[18:55] that is why I came to you
[18:57] that I will get a shelter at your home.
[19:01] But it feels like you are 
not ready to keep me, mama.
[19:06] Brother, you remember your promise, right?
[19:09] Maheen, this is not a child’s game,
[19:13] that you leave home on minor things
[19:15] and then expect your mother and brother 
that they will keep you without asking questions.
[19:20] But you said you know if I take such a step,
[19:25] the reason for it won’t be small,
 it will be something huge.
[19:28] That is the thing, I am asking you, 
what happened?
[19:31] What is the reason?
[19:32] I am not happy there.
[19:34] I don’t want to live there with Umar.
[19:36] I don’t want to live,
[19:38] is this something small?
[19:39] Yes, its something small.
[19:42] Look Maheen, till the time we don’t find out
what happened between you two,
[19:46] how do we agree that
 the reason is something big or small?
[19:51] I have come here,
[19:54] and you will have to keep me here.
[19:56] I didn’t come here to go back.
[19:59] If you take me out of here,
 you think for yourself,
[20:02] where will I go?
[20:15] This is not my Maheen,
[20:19] this is some other girl.
[20:23] She has completely changed.
[20:26] I dropped Maheen at aunt’s home, 
because she asked me to.
[20:32] Why did you drop her at her mom’s?
[20:36] when I have said that 
I will leave your life and never come back.
[20:43] You would have forgotten me in 
three to four days anyway.
[20:49] Could she not wait a little?
[20:52] Roshni,
[20:54] she said that
[20:58] her decision won’t change 
with you leaving or staying,
[21:03] whether you love me or not,
[21:05] whether I love you or not,
[21:10] she doesn’t love me.
[21:14] How can someone not love you, Umar?
[21:20] Someone ask my heart,
 how much I have prayed
[21:24] that you don’t think of me.
[21:30] She is thankless.
[21:34] She got you so easily,
[21:37] you tell her to ask me
[21:40] how much I have prayed to make you mine.
[21:48] That’s
[21:51] how God writes destiny,
[21:54] the one you love, you don’t get and 
the one who gets it, doesn’t really desire it.
[22:11] You love me so much Roshni.
[22:13] You know you are stupid,,
 you are crying for her.
[22:18] I am not crying for her.
[22:20] I am made of your love,
[22:24] I got teary eyed for you.
[22:27] Roshni, whatever happens is for the better.
[22:31] You just think that whatever happened, 
there is something good in it.
[22:36] Even I didn’t wanted her
 to leave suddenly like this.
[22:40] It’s a matter of relatives,
[22:43] I could be blamed tomorrow for this.
[22:47] But its her wish, 
she wanted to go, so she left.
[22:51] I feel that all of this is better in your favor.
[22:57] You got paid for your patience.
[23:00] Paid for my patience?
[23:02] What else?
[23:05] You really like me,
[23:07] you love me so much
[23:10] and how you tolerated it,
[23:12] and gave permission with an open hear
that me and her can live together.
[23:16] This was your patience 
and you got paid for it.
[23:22] You don’t have to go away from me,
[23:27] nor do you have to wait for a long time.
[23:35] No,
[23:37] I cannot do this.
[23:40] I see someone’s home breaking in front of me,
[23:42] and I celebrate.
[23:47] No Umar,
[23:50] I,
[23:52] I will talk to Maheen myself.
[23:55] You went to meet her.
[23:58] Did she say something?
[24:02] Why?
[24:03] What happened? Did she say something?
[24:06] No,
[24:08] nothing,
[24:11] she just told me that you came to meet.
[24:14] Okay.
[24:23] Will you eat something else?
[24:41] Mama. Mama.
[24:45] You won’t say anything to them.
[24:46] Why won’t I say anything?
[24:47] They are answerable to me.
[24:49] I will ask them what happened that
 my daughter doesn’t complain one bit
[24:53] and doesn’t want to go back home.
[24:55] Mama,
[24:59] you don’t want to ask them,
[25:01] you just want to send me back at any cost.
[25:04] You got rid of me like a burden earlier, 
now you want to do the same.
[25:09] I go back anyway possible,
 you will be at peace
[25:11] that you have fulfilled
 your daughter’s responsibility,
[25:13] and there,
[25:15] whether I am dying or living,
 you don’t care about that.
[25:20] No my love, why won’t I care?
[25:24] Hey, I am your mother,
[25:27] I have to find out that what is happening in 
that home that you live and die daily.
[25:32] Hey, you are a piece of my heart,
 not an orphan.
[25:36] Let me talk to them,
 I will ask them what is happening.
[25:41] They…
[25:41] Brother used to say they will take you like their daughter
 and I will also ask Umar as well...
[25:45] Uncle didn’t do anything, 
aunt didn’t either.
[25:46] You be quiet.
[25:49] This Umar, who acts deaf and 
dumb in front of his mother, I will ask him too.
[25:53] Yes hello.
[25:54] Yes Razia.
[25:56] Zakia, are you in your senses?
[25:58] No one mentioned this to us,
 neither Maheen, not Umar.
[26:02] But…
[26:04] hello.
[26:07] Najia!
[26:08] Mama!
[26:09] Someone listen to me,
 these two have created a new scene now.
[26:16] Cunning, both of them,
[26:18] they didn’t let us know anything 
and look at her,
[26:22] she was leaving after meeting 
with such an innocent face.
[26:25] She didn’t even tell us, 
what was her intention behind leaving.
[26:29] Umar, you should have at least told us
 that she is going after being upset.
[26:33] God knows what she cried 
about in front of her mother about,
[26:36] that Zakia was getting out of control.
[26:38] She insulted me so much like 
we are tormenting her badly.
[26:44] Now why are you sitting quietly?
[26:46] Why don’t you speak up?
[26:48] What happened that 
she went to stay at her mother’s home?
[26:51] What did you do?
[26:55] Did what?
[26:57] What did I do?
[26:59] She doesn’t want to live here,
[27:02] she went by her own will.
[27:04] I tried a lot to convince her, she didn’t listen.
[27:06] What should I have done? 
Tied her and made her stay with me forcefully?
[27:09] Be a man,
[27:11] you couldn’t handle a wife.
[27:13] Stupid!
[27:16] Tell me, what did she lack here?
[27:18] She had all the luxuries, peace and comfort, 
what problem did she have?
[27:28] She doesn’t want anything,
Neither your peace nor comfort, you people forget her.
[27:33] Why are you acting like a child?
 How do we forget her?
[27:37] Look Umar, 
whatever the problem is between you two,
[27:40] we will have you both seated in front of us
 and we will hear you two out. That’s it.
[27:44] What will you hear out?
[27:46] What do you want to hear? 
What had to be heard, I have heard it.
[27:49] The truth is she didn’t like me, 
she doesn’t want to live with me.
[27:54] That’s it!
[27:55] Umar…
[27:56] Oh God,
[27:58] look at her,
 I used to think she was so good,
[28:01] and nice, quiet and naïve.
[28:04] She said all this to my son and left.
[28:07] Oh God,
[28:09] my Umar’s heart must have been hurt so much.
[28:12] I am not willing to believe this.
[28:15] Who are you we talking about? 
Maheen. Is she a stranger?
[28:18] She is a child, we have brought her up.
[28:22] Look Razia,
[28:24] this is something else
[28:27] and Umar is hiding something.
[28:30] He is hiding something.
[28:31] I don’t understand when these two used to fight,
[28:36] I didn’t hear a small sound out of their room.
[28:39] God keep Najia and Mansoor happy,
[28:43] when they fight,
[28:45] at least four to five homes in the locality have fun.
[28:48] Here you go, we have our own sorrow here, 
that we were not able to enjoy the fights.
[28:53] Wow mama, great. Great mama. Great.
[29:24] If you cannot face the situation,
[29:27] you cannot fight with it, then give up.
[29:32] step back.
[29:35] Stop meeting Roshni.
[29:40] If this is not possible for you,
[29:44] then fight,
[29:47] do what I am telling you to.
[29:54] Razia makes you do a lot of work, right?
[29:58] She has burdened you with everything at home.
[30:04] When I got married and came to this home,
[30:07] Razia did the same with me,
[30:11] she put all her share of work on me.
[30:15] But see Maheen,
[30:16] I didn’t leave the ground and run away.
[30:19] You need to be patient for a little while, 
and then you get control of the time.
[30:25] I know its difficult to survive with Razia,
[30:30] that is why Najia has issues
 with her mother in law
[30:34] but everyone else is good,
[30:37] and then Umar,
[30:39] tolerate it for a few days for Umar. Huh?
[30:44] Mama, I cannot tolerate Umar.
[30:48] Oh, all men of this family 
are their mother’s beloved,
[30:52] their dolls,
[30:54] your father, your uncle and now Umar too.
[31:00] I will say again, it’s a matter of a few days, 
he will come out of the control of his mother.
[31:04] See, did Mansoor ran away or not.
[31:10] You know I will talk to brother and tell him that
 just like he separated Mansoor’s home,
[31:14] he should do the same for you and Umar.
[31:16] All the problems and issues will be over.
[31:19] Then you and 
Umar can live your life peacefully.
[31:23] Mama,
[31:24] Umar is the one I don’t want 
to live my life with.
[31:48] Oh God Roshni, stop it!
[31:50] You have been sleeping since evening, 
wake up now. it’s enough.
[31:54] I am getting up.
[31:57] Your friend is here too, 
you have to go meet her too.
[32:00] What is the hurry? I will meet her.
[32:03] No,
[32:04] you will not go anywhere tomorrow.
[32:06] Your uncle’s grandson,
[32:09] they have a party for him,
 you will go with me.
[32:13] Mama,
[32:16] I will not go anywhere tomorrow anyway 
and what about Maheen,
[32:20] she is there at her mother’s home.
[32:24] What?
[32:25] What do you mean?
[32:27] This means that she wasn’t able to get along 
with her in-laws and not even her husband.
[32:35] What are you saying, Roshni?
[32:40] God have mercy.
[32:44] God have mercy, mama. 
Get me something to eat, please.
[32:48] Yes, I will get something.
[32:51] Thank you.
[34:58] Hello.
[35:00] How are you Maheen?
[35:03] I am fine sister in law.
[35:04] I don’t find anything fine
between you and Umar.
[35:08] What happened that you packed your bag
 and went to your mother’s home?
[35:12] What can I say sister in law,
[35:14] at time a person has to make decisions
 that your heart doesn’t agree to,
[35:20] but the mind tells you that it’s okay.
[35:23] Maheen, you don’t make 
such big decisions alone.
[35:27] You should have talked to me, 
we are all your well wishers.
[35:31] In fact, you are like my younger sister, 
what am I here for?
[35:35] So much happened and
 you didn’t tell us anything.
[35:39] what a lot?
[35:42] A loot didn’t happen,
[35:44] its just that everyone made 
something so small a big issue.
[35:48] You left your home,
[35:49] you left Umar and 
you are sitting at your mother’s home,
[35:53] its not something so small, Maheen.
[35:56] Tell me, 
what is the reason for not liking Umar?
[36:00] There is no reason sister in law.
[36:02] The situation in which we got married…
[36:07] we didn’t have time
 to understand each other.
[36:11] What do you mean?
[36:13] What more do the two of you 
want to understand?
[36:16] You did something so weird.
[36:18] At least you could have spoken to me,
 I would have given you the solution for this problem.
[36:22] I would have given you such a solution
[36:23] that the problem would have solved
and there was no need to break the relations.
[36:28] Hello?
[36:30] Maheen, are you listening?
[36:32] Yes sister in law,
[36:34] I listen to everyone.
[36:37] Now tell me, 
what is the solution for this problem?
[36:43] You will find out soon sister in law.
[36:48] Hello.
[36:50] Maheen?
