[00:21] Roshni,
[00:23] why don’t you come to your senses?
[00:25] Look in our homes,
we will get proposal for people like us.
[00:29] You just suffered at the hands of Shahista just now.
[00:32] When am I saying I want to marry a billionaire.
[00:36] Okay,
[00:37] then who do you want to marry?
[00:39] Roshni, I am your mother,
tell me clearly who do you like?
[00:44] Mama, the one I would love,
I won’t marry him either.
[00:52] You are out of your mind.
[00:54] My mind is working fine, in fact perfect!
[00:58] You should marry someone who loves you.
[01:01] Mama, there are two things in this world,
a lot of money or a lot of love.
[01:08] Either marry me to someone rich,
[01:11] or someone who loves me so much that
he will keep the world at the tip of his shoes for me.
[01:17] Wow.
[01:18] This is a new scheme that has been born?
[01:21] Mama,
[01:23] I am telling you,
[01:25] if you marry me someone
who doesn’t appreciate me,
[01:28] I will not come and beg you,
I will make your life hell.
[01:33] My love,
[01:35] you have already done that,
you are not giving me any comfort.
[01:51] Umar, what happened?
Why are you not having breakfast?
[01:54] Everyone has had breakfast and left,
and you are not even eating.
[01:58] Grandma, I don’t feel like it.
[02:01] Why? What happened?
[02:08] Grandma, tea.
[02:11] No, I don’t want to have it right now,
[02:13] I have to take my medication first.
[02:15] In fact, do one thing,
get tea to my room, I will have it there.
[02:26] You should have had breakfast at least,
[02:28] aunt made it, not me.
[02:31] I made tea, don’t have it.
[02:35] Its not that Maheen,
[02:37] that money was given by papa,
[02:39] you can keep it.
[02:42] Fine,
[02:44] then ask uncle to give the money to me himself.
[02:47] What sort of stubbornness is this Maheen?
How will it work like that?
[02:50] You started it Umar,
[02:53] if you think getting your work
done is showing your right,
[02:57] then why should I show my right on you?
[03:19] Hello mama.
[03:21] Hello, you are back.
[03:23] You took so long today?
[03:26] I stopped at mama’s for a while on my way back.
[03:30] You just don’t do what I told you to,
you just visit your mother.
[03:35] If your mother had said the same thing,
you would never ignored it.
[03:40] I still wouldn’t be able to do mama,
[03:42] because your son has to go,
[03:44] its up to him, if he goes or doesn’t go.
[03:48] God forbid if my mother had said this,
[03:52] Mansoor would have wrecked a havoc,
[03:54] that how dare my mother say this.
[04:11] Grandma.
[04:12] Yes?
[04:14] Here you go.
[04:16] What happened? You just left like that.
[04:18] Nothing like that,
[04:21] but tell me,
[04:23] what is the planning going on between
the one who lives upstairs and Razia?
[04:29] Who is the one who lives upstairs?
[04:30] Najia.
[04:32] Day before yesterday,
[04:35] both husband and wife were sitting
in Razia’s room for an hour.
[04:38] The door was locked yesterday too.
[04:40] Today she came to see her
as soon as she came from school.
[04:43] I don’t know grandma,
she must have gone to say hello.
[04:46] Leave it, she is not that obedient.
[04:50] And you,
[04:52] you wear these two dresses, you take one off,
wear the other, don’t you have any other clothes?
[04:56] Grandma,
[04:57] all the clothes are so heavy,
with a lot of embroidery,
[05:00] how can I wear them at home,
[05:02] there are just a couple of light dresses,
I wear them.
[05:04] Yes, that is right,
[05:05] the clothes in dowry are heavy,
to wear when you go out.
[05:10] But you have been married for 2 months,
didn’t Umar get you other clothes?
[05:15] Let him come,
[05:17] I will teach him a lesson and this Razia,
she doesn’t realize this?
[05:20] If she tells Umar, he will listen,
[05:22] he follows Razia’s orders.
[05:26] And you too, you are sitting quietly,
why don’t you ask Umar yourself?
[05:30] No grandma,
[05:31] I didn’t feel the need so I said nothing,
you too please don’t say anything to Umar.
[05:37] Why don’t I say anything?
I will surely tell him.
[05:40] Yes!
[05:49] Is it done?
[05:51] Or is there something left?
[05:53] What?
[05:54] I lied at home, took such a big risk
[05:57] that I am coming to meet you
[05:59] and you are telling me
 the problems of your married life.
[06:03] If you want a suggestion, 
take it from her too.
[06:06] Roshni, you too are being sarcastic.
[06:09] I am saying to you what is in my heart,
[06:11] who else do I share it with?
[06:14] You say all that is in your 
heart to your childhood friend.
[06:17] As per you, 
she is still your best friend.
[06:20] Hey no,
[06:22] in fact, that cannot happen either. 
She is the biggest issue of your life.
[06:28] That poor thing is not an issue.
[06:30] You stop calling her a poor thing.
[06:33] I agree this wedding 
didn’t happen cause of her,
[06:36] I also agree that 
she didn’t try to come between us,
[06:40] but she did come and 
she is standing her ground,
[06:44] then why does she make you
feel guilty again and again?
[06:48] No,
[06:49] everything was going fine, 
I talked about my right, just like that…
[06:55] You married her,
[06:57] she lives with you in that home,
 in your room.
[07:00] When you want,
[07:02] you can leave that home 
and come meet me.
[07:05] I have so much pressure from my family,
[07:08] I get proposals daily.
[07:10] You don’t let me live, 
nor give me permission to die.
[07:15] I don’t understand how all 
this is so easy for you, Umar.
[07:20] You are a selfish man, nothing else.
[07:23] Roshni.
[07:25] Roshni.
[07:26] Roshni, where are you going?
[07:28] Wait.
[07:30] Roshni.
[07:34] Auto.
[07:36] Where are you going? 
I will drop you.
[07:38] I came alone, I will go alone.
[07:42] You go to your queen and 
take care of her tantrums.
[07:46] Roshni, listen…
[07:47] No, do one thing,
[07:49] next time bring her along,
[07:51] so that the poor thing can go
around with us, enjoy a little.
[07:56] Roshni. Roshni.
[07:58] Roshni, listen to me, what is this?
[08:32] Maheen.
[08:34] Maheen.
[08:34] Yes aunt.
[08:35] Zakia called.
[08:37] Mama?
[08:38] Yes.
[08:38] If you wanted something you 
should have told me or Umar,
[08:41] why did you want to mention it to your mother?
[08:45] Mama, I didn’t say anything to mama.
[08:49] Okay. Okay. Don’t start crying.
[08:51] I am not scolding you 
for what you said to whom,
[08:55] I am scolding you because mama is a jukebox,
 a complete jukebox.
[08:59] She called Zakia immediately, 
and you know what she said?
[09:03] What?
[09:04] That we don’t care about your needs 
and she has married her daughter,
[09:09] thrown her, has forgotten.
[09:11] She should at least realize what you need, 
what you don’t need.
[09:14] See now, she got us insulted.
[09:17] No aunt,
[09:18] even mama knows grandma’s habits,
 she won’t mind.
[09:23] Look Maheen,
[09:24] you be careful when talking to mama,
[09:27] with her increasing age, 
she is unable to understand
[09:32] and she doesn’t leave a chance 
to take out her anger on me.
[09:37] Now tell me,
[09:38] Zakia is not just my sister in law,
[09:41] in fact she is also now my son’s mother in law.
[09:42] What respect will I have left in front of her?
[09:46] Ok, go over with Umar tomorrow,
[09:48] if he delays or makes excuses,
 let me know I will take you there.
[09:52] Child, If you don’t mention your needs
 to your husband, then who will you ask?
[09:57] Okay come on, work now.
[10:20] Mama, has Maheen come?
[10:23] No, did she have to come?
[10:27] I saw Umar near the park,
[10:30] I thought he would be dropping 
Maheen and going back.
[10:33] Then they will properly come?
[10:34] No mama, I saw him an hour back.
[10:37] He was alone,
[10:39] I thought he would be going back.
[10:43] If he didn’t come here,
[10:45] then what was he doing there?
[10:47] Hey, he must have come with some work,
[10:50] men have a 1000 things to do
[10:52] and since he has been married,
[10:54] he has become serious and become responsible.
[10:58] He is working hard.
[11:00] Maheen is lucky.
[11:03] Yes, you are right,
[11:06] but I don’t know there is something 
that keeps on bothering me.
[11:10] Its your sister’s love,
 that keeps you restless
[11:13] or else Maheen couldn’t get
 better in-laws than that home.
[11:28] I have ironed all your shirts,
[11:31] should I make you tea?
[11:36] Umar,
[11:38] I have found a solution for 
what you talked to me about.
[11:42] You will not feel that it is your right as a husband
when I do your work and
[11:49] I will not feel that I am taking
 money from you as a wife.
[11:55] You give me that money for 
the work that I do,
[11:59] and I will think I am taking 
that money for the work that I do.
[12:19] Its not that I need money,
[12:23] actually,
[12:26] you were right.
[12:28] How long will this go on for?
[12:31] The family will ask and there will be questions,
[12:34] so to save ourselves from all this,
[12:41] I have found this solution.
[13:11] I have been here for 4 hours,
[13:14] he didn’t send me a single message,
[13:16] nor did he bother saying sorry.
[13:49] Why?
[13:51] Why can’t I say this?
[13:53] I am not illiterate, I know it all.
[13:55] Yes, but I didn’t know that you could think
 like this for Najia and Mansoor.
[14:03] God knows my intentions,
[14:05] but these people have not cared about me.
[14:10] Najia misbehaved with me even today,
[14:15] think for their best and get insulted.
[14:19] Its ok, you gave them 
a good suggestion to them,
[14:22] that’s fine.
[14:25] Yes, and Mahi put this in my head.
[14:28] Mahi?
[14:30] Since when did she become so smart?
[14:32] Not smart,
[14:34] she said it out of her naivety, 
but it touched my heart.
[14:39] You know Mr. Fareed, 
can I tell you something,
[14:42] for the first time in my life, 
I have not thought like a mother or a mother in law,
[14:46] I thought like a woman.
[14:50] I felt Najia’s pain,
[14:54] that is why I spoke to Mansoor,
[14:57] but obviously I cannot be more open.
[15:01] You have to force him.
[15:05] Yes Razia,
[15:07] I will find the right moment and talk to him.
[15:12] Fine.
[15:20] I will see,
[15:21] how long will you be able to stop yourself,
[15:23] I will not call.
[15:26] You will come after me yourself.
[15:49] How do I call you?
[15:52] What do I say?
[15:54] Then you will again say
 I am traveling in two boats.
[15:59] Umar.
[16:04] You…
[16:07] you went to meet Roshni,
[16:09] in the park near our home?
[16:17] You are spying on me, Maheen?
[16:21] No,
[16:24] you give everyone a chance yourself.
[16:28] Brother Monis saw you, he called.
[16:34] Did he see me with Roshni?
[16:36] He was surprised 
what you were doing there at that time.
[16:39] I made an excuse you had some work there.
[16:47] Umar, don’t do this.
[16:52] Do not do what?
[16:55] Do I stop meeting her?
[16:57] Stop talking to her?
[17:00] This will never happen Maheen,
[17:03] and its not cause 
I cannot live without meeting her,
[17:07] but because if I don’t meet her,
[17:08] that poor thing will die.
[17:11] You have seen her condition,
[17:13] what have I done to her?
[17:16] I have hurt her a lot,
[17:17] after hurting her I don’t even console her?
[17:20] Leave her to cry and mourn?
[17:25] No, I am not saying that.
[17:27] Then what are you saying Maheen?
[17:29] Say it.
[17:31] Be sarcastic towards me.
[17:32] That being married, I have a lover,
[17:35] I am doing wrong with you and 
I am doing wrong with her too.
[17:38] I am mistreating two girls, say it.
[17:41] It is all my fault.
[17:44] I am bad.
[18:07] See how Fareed has forced you into work,
[18:10] you go in the morning, come back late at night.
[18:13] Now see, you two are children,
[18:16] you two must want to go out, for outing.
[18:21] You don’t worry son,
[18:22] I will talk to Fareed.
[18:24] Grandma, you don’t talk, please.
[18:26] Why?
[18:28] All the burden will fall on him.
[18:30] I will talk to him myself. I will come early.
[18:33] Anyway, you will have to come early today,
[18:36] I have even told your father.
[18:38] Why?
[18:39] What is so special today?
[18:41] Take Maheen to the market, take her shopping.
[18:44] What is wrong mama? Is she a child?
[18:46] She will go herself.
[18:48] What problem do you have taking her?
[18:51] Now see yourself mama,
[18:53] I am saying it but he is making excuses.
[18:55] Then you will blame me for everything 
that I didn’t let him go.
[18:59] Let him not go, you don’t go either.
[19:02] I am here.
[19:03] I am her grandma,
[19:05] she is a sign of my child,
[19:07] I will take her to the market myself.
[19:09] Yes, Yes.
[19:11] We are not related to her,
[19:12] you are the only well wisher of her,
[19:15] or else everyone in 
the in-laws will eat her alive.
[19:17] Yes, what else?
[19:19] If it was in your hands,
[19:20] you would treat her the same way
 that you treated Najia.
[19:24] I am here,
[19:25] or else she would be in a similar condition as Najia.
[19:27] Yes, yes, mama, you are…
[19:30] Oh come on, the two of you stop your firing.
[19:32] You are always arguing.
[19:35] Tell her to be ready by 5 pm.
[20:22] Roshni,
[20:22] your aunt is here,
[20:24] go sit with her.
[20:27] I just met her, its not been ages.
[20:31] Listen, she has to go to 
the market to get a frock for Munni,
[20:35] you go with her.
[20:37] Can she not go yourself?
[20:40] Okay,
[20:41] you usually are unable to stay home,
[20:44] now you have to go with your aunt,
 you are having a problem.
[20:46] You run around doing Maheen’s work.
[20:50] Today one of your own asked you,
[20:52] you are in so much pain?
[20:55] Roshni.
[20:57] You wont go, right?
[20:59] Don’t go.
[21:00] Sit in your room.
[21:02] I will have to go.
[21:04] My joints hurt too.
[21:07] But no one cares.
[21:09] Go!
[21:28] Why is he not messaging me after all?
[21:31] I feel that cunning Maheen 
instigated him against me.
[21:39] I will do something to him that 
he will remember all his life.
[22:13] Man, you are standing here like
 this is the first time you failed.
[22:15] You should be in practice.
[22:18] Mama said if I fail once more
 she wont let me study further.
[22:23] She will make me stay home.
[22:25] Wow!
[22:25] You are free!
[22:26] Celebrate it!
[22:27] Its going to be fun.
[22:28] What fun?
[22:30] I wanted to be something.
[22:33] What?
[22:34] Something big.
[22:36] For example, engineer,
[22:40] doctor,
[22:41] scientist,
[22:43] some surgeon
[22:45] or you wanted to go to NASA? 
What did you want to do.
[22:46] Be quiet Umar.
[22:48] Okay listen. Listen to me.
[22:50] You don’t know the table for 5,
[22:52] what was that essay?
[22:53] My favorite cousin,
[22:54] you cannot write it.
[22:56] How will you become an engineer or doctor?
[22:58] I cannot write it cause 
I don’t have a favorite cousin.
[23:00] Oh.
[23:01] And,
[23:02] if not an engineer or doctor, 
I would have completed my BA.
[23:05] I would have become a teacher somewhere.
[23:08] There is a job, you can do it.
[23:11] You know it doesn’t require a degree, 
but hard work.
[23:17] There is greatness in hard work.
[23:18] I want to earn my own money,
 I don’t want to be a burden.
[23:21] Yes, madam great will you do the job?
[23:24] Yes.
[23:24] You sure.
[23:25] Yes.
[23:25] Promise?
[23:26] I don’t want to be a burden on anyone, tell me.
[23:28] So, then do a job in someone’s home, 
a maid, become a maid.
[23:33] You look like a maid.
[23:36] What is wrong? Why are you hitting me?
[23:38] Hey. Come on my horse.
[23:40] Umar!
[23:53] Look, my first earning,
[23:56] I washed your clothes, ironed
[23:59] then and got money for making tea and breakfast.
[24:15] Fine, there is nothing wrong in this.
[24:25] I know papa,
[24:28] I am not saying no.
[24:32] Then why are you delaying it?
[24:36] Are you scared?
[24:43] Look Mansoor, there is no point in delaying the reality.
[24:49] Look, your reports will provide clarity on the treatment,
[24:55] who needs the treatment.
[25:03] It will all be fine, by the will of God.
[25:05] God will be kind.
[25:11] And if we get a report that
[25:16] this treatment is not possible,
[25:19] then?
[25:29] Then at least,
[25:31] Najia will be protected from the curses 
from your mother and other people.
[25:38] What she has no fault in, 
why should she be punished for it.
[25:50] There is a benefit in both cases,
[25:55] one has your benefit,
[25:58] one has Najia’s.
[26:04] Have tea, its getting cold.
[26:14] Look, I got such a pretty suit for you.
[26:17] Wow.
[26:18] Its good, right?
[26:19] Hey look, I forgot to tell you.
[26:22] You know who I saw today,
[26:24] Maheen and Umar.
[26:26] Hey, they looked so good together, 
they were enjoying themselves.
[26:31] You know Maheen had so much stuff in her hands,
[26:36] what do I say now, but by the grace of God,
[26:39] you know I feel Umar spends openly,
[26:43] he got Maheen to shop so much,
[26:46] that I made a prayer for them,
[26:48] that may God always keep them happy.
[26:50] You tell me, how did you like this dress?
[26:53] Its not good.
[26:56] Hey,
[26:57] Roshni,
[26:59] you have so many tantrums,
[27:01] I selected this after searching hard.
[27:08] Ill-mannered!
[27:30] So this is why you have forgotten me.
[27:33] You forgot me, when I got upset.
[27:37] You started caring for your wife so quickly.
[27:41] I am that easy to forget.
[27:46] I should be the only one you should remember,
[27:50] and you will see this.
[28:26] Thank you, Umar.
[28:29] What for?
[28:31] All this,
[28:32] you got me to shop so much,
[28:35] thanks.
[28:37] Mama asked me,
[28:39] papa gave me the money,
[28:41] so go thank him.
[28:44] After all, they didn’t do you a favor,
[28:48] they paid the salary,
[28:51] you work so much,
[28:53] you pressed so many shirts yesterday,
[28:55] you do the home,
[28:56] their work, my work,
[28:58] so what?
[29:03] You have a problem with that too?
[29:07] You passed a sarcastic comment on this too.
[29:11] I took out this solution for our ease.
[29:16] You are not happy with this either?
[29:21] What are you happy with Umar?
[30:04] Um..Umar.
[30:06] Umar.
[30:10] You decide what you want.
[30:15] What are you satisfied with?
[30:19] I will do that.
[30:46] Umar, listen,
[30:48] you have to meet me tomorrow at all cost.
[30:51] Alright?
[30:54] You will meet me, right?
[31:18] The question Maheen asked me,
 I want to ask the same question to myself.
[31:24] After all, what am I happy about?
[31:26] What is it that will satisfy me.
[31:30] I have a feeling of crime, 
a sadness when with Roshni
[31:36] and when I am with Maheen, I have a regret.
[32:15] I thought I would also ruin my night like you,
[32:21] maybe it will reduce the burden on the heart.
[32:27] Does it reduce?
[32:34] Do you get answer from there?
[32:40] Brother, I am already worried,
[32:43] don’t worry me further.
[32:47] I am also worried.
[32:49] Then go to your room and get worried,
[32:51] what are you doing here?
[32:55] I am surprised,
[32:58] you didn’t even ask me about my worry.
[33:02] Anyway,
[33:04] I am your elder brother,
[33:07] tell me what the issue is?
[33:15] The same?
[33:19] You still miss her?
[33:25] Missing her is not an issue,
[33:29] it’s a pain,
[33:31] and I go through it.
[33:36] Then?
[33:40] Do you still meet her?
[33:47] This is the issue.
[33:51] The one that got out of hand,
 running after her.
[33:54] She is the one running,
[33:58] I am supporting her.
[34:04] Brother,
[34:06] I broke her heart.
[34:10] I went against my promise,
[34:13] in a way, I cheated her.
[34:18] I am really embarrassed.
[34:22] If I meet her, I do it to wipe her tears.
[34:28] What do I do?
[34:32] You tell me, what do I do?
[34:35] Should I leave her suffering, crying?
[34:41] When you stop wiping her tears,
[34:46] she will stop shedding tears.
[34:47] I wish.
[34:50] I wish this could happen,
[34:53] that she forgets me, starts to hate me.
[35:00] But that poor thing,
[35:04] loves this unfaithful person I am,
 she loves me with all her heart.
[35:13] Had she loved you,
[35:15] she would never be a problem for you.
[35:19] She would have ended your worries,
 by going away from you.
[35:22] Brother, please, 
you don’t know anything, you just…
[35:24] you just leave it.
[35:29] You are right.
[35:31] I know nothing.
[35:34] You know everything well,
[35:37] you are smart after all.
[35:42] Umar,
[35:44] think for Maheen.
[35:49] I do think about her.
[35:52] What do you think?
 I don’t think about Maheen?
[35:55] I think that is why this is my condition,
[35:57] that is why I am so restless
[36:00] or else why would it matter to me,
[36:03] I would have blamed her,
[36:05] roamed around happy 
and lived my life freely.
[36:09] Brother, how would you know what the feeling is 
that you are doing injustice to two people.
[36:17] Because of you two people are worried,
[36:19] unhappy and even after you wanting to and trying a lot,
[36:23] you are unable to do anything.
[36:28] At times I think,
[36:30] I swear,
[36:31] I want to kill myself.
[36:35] I take my life, 
so that this daily living and dying ends.
[36:40] Man, you are a bigger coward than me,
[36:43] although I always praised your bravery.
[36:51] Forget her.
[36:55] What is the point of running
after the one who is not in your fate.
[37:00] Maheen is attached to your fate,
[37:04] so accept her with your heart,
[37:07] she is a good girl.
[37:08] When did I say she is a bad girl?
[37:11] I never said that.
[37:16] But what do I do with my heart,
[37:20] that only beats for her?
[37:27] Brother, I cannot leave her,
[37:31] I cannot live without her.
[37:38] You just pray for me
[37:41] that she leaves me,
[37:44] she forgets me, starts hating me.
[37:49] She frees me of her love.
