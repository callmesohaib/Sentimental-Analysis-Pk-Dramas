[00:23] You are not at peace,
[00:26] instead of staying on your bed comfortably,
[00:30] you go around so much.
[00:38] You are not well Fareed.
[00:40] No, its your superstition mama.
[00:47] Hello.
[00:48] Hello. Live long.
[00:51] I am just going, bye.
[00:52] Okay, bye.
[00:55] Go safe, come back safe.
[00:58] See Fareed,
[01:00] our Umar has become so smart,
and responsible.
[01:04] In his age, even you were
not this smart and responsible,
[01:07] he cares for everyone so much,
he cares for everyone.
[01:10] He worries.
[01:11] Umar.
[01:14] Yes papa.
[01:21] Come back in the evening,
[01:24] don’t get too late.
[01:28] I have to talk about something important.
[01:35] Yes.
[01:36] Fine.
[01:48] What do you want to talk about, Fareed?
[01:51] Is everything ok?
[01:53] Yes, everything is fine.
[01:58] No, there is something,
[02:01] I have been seeing since yesterday,
everyone is upset.
[02:06] Everyone is quiet,
[02:09] there is something that
all of you are hiding from me.
[02:14] You are mistaken mama,
[02:17] another superstition.
[02:21] Yes,
[02:23] I have grown old,
[02:25] I am old,
[02:28] I have no importance in this home,
no one tells me anything.
[02:33] Everyone hides things from me.
[02:54] What do you say?
[02:58] Should we talk to Umar straightforwardly?
[03:19] First let me decide
what I have to talk about.
[03:21] What is there to think about in this?
[03:23] Tell him clearly to take out
that girl from his heart
[03:26] and live in this home like a decent man.
[03:29] If there is a need, scold him.
[03:37] If I had found out about
this some time back, Razia.
[03:42] I would have been strict with Umar,
[03:46] I would have forced him,
[03:50] but now this will not happen.
[03:54] Why?
[03:56] Why can’t it happen now?
[04:01] I have seen death from up-close Razia.
[04:14] So much life has passed,
[04:17] yours and my wedding,
kids, their wedding.
[04:25] We saw success and defeat,
we saw it all.
[04:34] We didn’t lose the will to live.
[04:38] You know when I saw death in front of me,
[04:43] all the hidden happiness in
my heart came in front of my eyes,
[04:49] that I won’t be able to see
them being complete.
[04:53] God forbid,
[04:55] what are you saying?'
[05:09] I have lived my life,
[05:13] in fact, figured it out.
[05:17] When someone like me feels this way,
[05:20] then my Umar is a child,
[05:24] won’t he have wishes in his heart?
[05:30] Do I make him regret?
[05:33] Hey,
[05:36] how have you started thinking?
[05:41] For God’s sake Mr. Fareed, be smart.
[05:45] Will you get cursed by the family
to fulfil your son’s wish?
[05:52] Will you make a new example by bringing
a second wife on top of your niece.
[05:57] That’s it.
[05:58] That’s it.
[06:00] That is where I stop thinking about Maheen.
[06:08] You and I can’t get her,
her happiness and right even if we want to.
[06:15] Even if we listen to Umar and even
if we don’t listen to Umar, then too.
[06:26] Then too?
[06:28] Look,
[06:30] if we scold and force
Umar to live with Maheen,
[06:39] how will Maheen stay happy with someone about
whom she knows that he likes someone else.
[06:47] Tell me.
[06:50] With time everything gets fine.
[07:18] I swear, I am telling the truth,
[07:20] he is fat,
[07:21] he’s bald and old too.
[07:23] I am sure he is at least
 twenty years older than you.
[07:26] Don’t you dare speak all this nonsense, Umar.
[07:28] This is not nonsense, I am telling the truth.
[07:31] Now what else could aunt do,
[07:32] for you she was getting proposal
for handicapped people.
[07:36] Umar stop it, I am going.
[07:37] Okay listen, listen to me.
[07:39] look, she too had to think that
 I have an average looking cousin,
[07:43] matric fail, who knows no work,
 we would find such a proposal for her.
[07:48] I am telling mama, 
that you are bothering me.
[07:49] Okay listen…
[07:50] What?
[07:51] Okay listen,
[07:52] I am preparing you mentally so that
 you don’t get a heart attack seeing him suddenly.
[07:58] You should have seen his picture,
at least you would have said no in shame.
[08:04] What would I do, 
had I seen his picture even?
[08:06] Even if he was really bald and 
fat I wouldn’t have been able to say no.
[08:09] I would have said yes, quietly.
[08:11] Mama decided, 
she must have done it after thinking.
[08:14] Its fine, we will get his plastic surgery done.
[08:16] Keep back the cucumber.
[08:17] What? Maheen!
[08:18] No, you are misbehaving with me.
[08:21] Man, you are such a miser.
[09:02] Boo!!!
[09:03] Hey, what happened?
 What are you doing?
[09:07] I was fixing the bulb.
[09:08] What if you fell?
[09:09] I fell because of you.
[09:11] Okay fine, don’t fall on me now.
[09:13] You idiot.
[09:14] You should have asked me, 
I would have done it.
[09:16] I would have had a heart attack.
[09:22] But see I changed the bulb.
[09:24] Yes, thank you very much, 
you did something great.
[09:27] I would have died.
[11:06] Monis.
[11:11] Monis, are you listening?
[11:15] Yes, I am listening.
[11:20] Fazeela’s mother called,
[11:23] she and her elders are coming 
over to our home in the evening.
[11:27] Your uncle and aunt cannot come, 
and its difficult for grandma too.
[11:31] I am thinking of calling 
Maheen and even Umar.
[11:34] Look mama,
[11:34] no need for so many arrangements,
[11:37] and I will talk to Fazeela’s family myself 
that I want to get married not setup a show.
[11:43] What are you saying?
[11:44] What show?
[11:46] Hey its their happiness,
[11:48] they will have wishes
[11:49] and I too will marry my only son 
the same way that I have thought.
[11:55] Everyone will gather for the first time 
after Maheen’s wedding.
[11:58] Its good,
[11:59] they will meet Maheen too.
[12:01] Your maternal side really want 
to see Maheen and Umar together.
[12:05] So are we the only ones 
left for the family’s fun.
[12:09] Mama, I have decided
 and this is my wish too
[12:13] that whatever will happen 
will be done with simplicity
[12:15] and I will not talk about this further.
[12:18] We will have the wedding at home,
[12:21] and the reception will be 
done on the roof or outside.
[12:23] We don’t have so much spare 
money for the family’s entertainment.
[14:40] I am telling you there is a tension at home, 
but you are saying what you want.
[14:44] Hey, we can also fix the wedding 
without Maheen and Umar.
[14:51] How are you talking?
[14:53] Huh?
[14:54] It means you don’t understand my worry,
[14:57] I have been saying for so long 
that the situation is tense, but no,
[14:59] you have your own stubbornness, 
you don’t understand.
[15:01] Bring everyone. 
Bring everyone. Bring everyone.
[15:04] Hey,
[15:05] I am not bringing anyone, 
and we are not fixing any date.
[15:40] Tea.
[15:47] Uncle, your special tea.
[15:51] Yes, sit child.
[15:57] I called you because…
[15:58] I want to talk to you uncle.
[16:00] That’s it,
[16:02] we are only able to talk and listen,
[16:05] your uncle has not left 
us capable of doing anything.
[16:09] If you give me permission right now,
[16:11] I will fix Umar.
[16:14] He will not even dare 
looking at someone else.
[16:18] Then you will be tormenting him again.
[16:20] Torment?
[16:21] He is tormenting you.
[16:25] He didn’t make any promises to me 
that he is failing to live up to.
[16:30] But he made promises to her,
[16:33] and you help him in fulfilling those promises.
[16:40] What are you saying, Maheen?
[16:45] You get Umar married where his heart is.
[17:02] Sit here.
[17:03] I have lied at home and come,
[17:05] mama has doubts 
and here you are upset.
[17:09] I am not upset, I am just tensed.
[17:15] Why are you in tension?
[17:18] I should be the one who should be tense,
[17:20] because whatever you saying,
[17:22] I don’t believe it even a little bit.
[17:25] What do you think, I am lying?
[17:28] You are not lying,
[17:30] but you have been lied to
[17:32] and you have believed it 
with your eyes closed.
[17:35] Why would any girl talk to her mother and
 father in law for her husband’s second wedding?
[17:46] I don’t believe it.
[17:54] You have any idea what you are saying Maheen?
[17:59] I am saying this after thinking a lot.
[18:02] After thinking a lot?
[18:04] Or did Umar threaten you 
and forced you to say this.
[18:09] Maheen,
[18:12] you are saying all this out of emotion,
[18:16] whatever it is.
[18:18] Look, this is not an action we can take,
[18:22] its not possible, 
no one can even think about it.
[18:24] Could anyone think that me
and Umar would get married?
[18:31] Could you think that you would go to your 
niece’s wedding and bring home a daughter in law?
[18:40] When the situation is against our estimate,
[18:45] then this is also fine.
[18:47] At least someone’s happiness is in this.
[18:50] Whose happiness?
[18:53] His mother is not happy,
[18:55] I am not happy,
[18:57] you are not happy
[18:58] and even Zakia won’t be 
happy finding out all this.
[19:02] We give everyone sorrow
 for Umar’s happiness?
[19:06] You think that my happiness is in this too.
[19:10] God knows what magic Umar has done on you.
[19:13] I am telling you,
[19:14] even if your uncle agrees hearing 
your emotional dialogues,
[19:18] I will never agree.
[19:20] I am telling you, with me around,
[19:22] Umar cannot bring a second wife to this home.
[19:24] he can bring her later, Razia.
[19:28] Don’t say that, uncle.
[19:31] God always have both 
your shadows on our head.
[19:41] The situation clearly tells us
[19:44] that Umar has decided,
[19:48] that is why Maheen is saying
 all this out of disappointment.
[19:55] I am not saying it out of disappointment,
[19:58] I am making the decision with my heart.
[20:01] You fulfill Umar’s wish,
[20:06] just like he fulfilled your wish once.
[20:13] Uncle,
[20:15] there is a big burden on my heart,
[20:18] I took over his life like an uninvited guest, 
uncle, free me of this burden.
[20:26] Uncle,
[20:28] you marry Umar there,
[20:31] where his heart is.
[20:33] Oh may I die! Umar’s second marriage?
[20:46] Maheen is saying she will talk
[20:51] and I know she will surely talk.
[20:54] Will she only talk or convince them too?
[20:58] She…
[21:00] You and your trust, Umar.
[21:02] Why would she want that 
you get married again, Umar?
[21:07] We could have believed it
 when she left home,
[21:11] but now,
[21:12] when she has come back in that home,
[21:15] its clear that she doesn’t want to end this relation
[21:19] and why would she want that
 a second wife comes in that home.
[21:24] It doesn’t matter to her at all.
[21:29] I think you are forgetting Roshni,
[21:32] even after my marriage, she let us meet.
[21:35] She gave me up to you, so easily.
[21:38] Did you forget?
[21:41] All this just means one thing,
[21:45] that maybe,
[21:47] she likes someone else.
[21:51] Listen…listen to me first.
[21:54] You are not able to accept her as your wife,
[21:57] you cannot accept this relation, why?
[22:00] Because you know me from before,
[22:02] you love me,
[22:04] she cannot accept you either,
[22:06] what does all this mean?
[22:08] That she likes someone else, 
she wants someone else.
[22:10] What nonsense is this man?
[22:12] What the hell are you saying?
[22:19] Come here, take this.
[22:21] Roshni, I have to go,
 I cannot talk right now. You…
[22:26] I am going.
[22:29] Come here!
[22:35] What is this, man?
[22:37] Such rubbish.
[22:38] Take it away!
[22:49] Hey, damn it, bloody hell! 
So this is what he was up to.
[22:54] I was thinking that he is working,
[22:57] he is married, he has become smart, 
he goes to work.
[23:00] But no, he goes around having his way, 
instead of going to work.
[23:04] And mama, God knows how long 
this has been going on for.
[23:06] Hey, you stop crying.
[23:08] And mama,
[23:09] what will doing all this achieve?
[23:10] Mama, curse Umar later,
[23:12] first ask him,
[23:14] he is being sympathetic to his beloved.
[23:16] To hell with your sympathies, 
where is Umar?
[23:20] Call him.
[23:21] I will teach him a lesson, he will learn.
[23:26] And, she is so cunning, 
have you got no shame?
[23:29] You really want to get
 a second wife to this home.
[23:32] Listen to me, if not us,
 then at least think about your mother.
[23:39] I am only thinking of bringing back
 happiness to this home, grandma.
[23:43] Happiness!
[23:45] The whole community will curse us,
[23:47] people will blame us that 
we got a second wife to this home.
[23:51] Who all will we clarify 
that you are involved in this.
[23:56] Grandma, you are worried about the curses of 
the family and not Umar’s happiness?
[24:03] And after all,
[24:05] are you related to the people or Umar?
[24:09] We have a relation with you too, Maheen.
[24:17] So now do we see Umar’s happiness,
[24:20] or your future?
[25:00] Hello,
[25:02] yes I am here, you too come.
[25:03] Hey, yes I am coming, 
just give me a minute.
[25:34] What is the matter? 
Why were you looking at Roshni like that?
[25:38] How?
[25:39] Like you were seeing her, 
with your eyes wide open.
[25:41] Come, I will tell you.
[25:44] You come, I will also tell you.
[25:46] Sit.
[25:56] He is shouting at me like I am his wife.
[25:59] The one he has at home as his wife, 
he should shout on her.
[26:09] Anyway,
[26:10] I have put the thought in his head,
[26:14] now he will think about marrying me later,
[26:17] he will now be in a hurry to divorce her.
[26:22] Even if she is a wife by name,
[26:25] but if she loves someone else,
[26:29] who tolerates that.
[26:33] Well done Roshni. Well done!
[26:57] You know, this Roshni is
the reason behind the problem.
[27:01] She is so ill-mannered,
 so cunning, she is so misleading.
[27:04] And tell me something,
[27:05] did your brother in law find her to 
get married to leaving behind all relations.
[27:08] I am still in shock thinking all this.
[27:11] After knowing all this,
 why is Maheen protecting Umar?
[27:15] Because this is what you call love,
 this is the name of wedding.
[27:19] And on top of that 
sister Maheen is really naïve.
[27:22] I am totally sure that this Roshni must have said 
a lot of wrong things about sister Maheen,
[27:25] she must have instigated brother Umar, 
that is why he is so misled.
[27:28] Look, whatever it is, 
whatever she has done or not done,
[27:31] I don’t care about it.
[27:33] The thing is that she has left 
no stone unturned to ruin my sister’s life.
[27:37] and sister Maheen?
[27:38] Does she not have a tongue?
Can she not fight for her right?
[27:41] Now you tell me yourself,
[27:42] how can I say to Maheen in all this tension,
[27:44] that Maheen,
[27:45] I want to get married and no matter what happens,
 you need to come to my wedding.
[27:50] Tell me.
[27:54] come on, let’s eat something.
[28:37] All this just means one thing,
[28:41] that maybe,
[28:43] she likes someone else.
[28:48] Listen…listen to me first.
[28:50] You are not able to accept her as your wife,
[28:53] you cannot accept this relation, why?
[28:56] Because you know me from before,
[28:58] you love me,
[29:00] she cannot accept you either, 
what does all this mean?
[29:04] That she likes someone else, 
she wants someone else.
[29:43] Grandma, all ok?
 You have not slept till now.
[29:47] You go and sleep,
[29:49] I am waiting for Umar.
[29:50] Go.
[30:19] Umar, wait a minute. Wait.
[30:20] Brother, what happened?
[30:21] Go up from here.
[30:23] Brother, I will listen to your lectures tomorrow, 
I am tired, I want to go inside.
[30:27] Hey, I am not that sad for you Umar
[30:29] that I take you along with me 
and have you sit with me,
[30:32] but you don’t go inside from this front way,
[30:33] go upstairs,
[30:34] then in the morning take the other way home.
[30:38] What happened?
[30:39] The situation is not good for you,
I was saying it to save you.
[30:45] I will see the situation,
[30:47] what will happen?
[30:48] Mama and papa will curse me the most,
[30:51] they will scold me, insult me, I will hear it.
[30:53] Hey, listen to me. Umar.
[30:56] Umar.
[31:00] Umar, come here.
[31:01] Come here.
[31:03] You, how dare you? What are you doing?
[31:05] Grandma. 
Grandma, have you gone mad?
[31:06] I will get hurt.
[31:07] Hey you move.
[31:08] Have you gone mad?
[31:11] Leave him grandma.
[31:12] You will get married again! 
I have gone mad?
[31:14] He will get hurt.
[31:15] Umar, you leave from here.
[31:16] Go from here. Umar, go upstairs. 
Leave him grandma, he made a mistake.
[31:19] You think I am mad.
[31:19] Leave him grandma, we will sit and talk.
[31:21] Leave me.
[31:21] Grandma, calm down. Sit down.
[31:23] He doesn’t care about his ill parents.
[31:25] He will get married again,
[31:27] have two wives.
[31:29] He is really young.
[31:30] Look at him.
[31:31] Grandma, we will sit and talk. 
Your blood pressure will shoot up.
[31:33] What is there to talk about?
[31:35] What will I talk about? 
Go talk to him, make him understand.
[31:38] Sit calmly and talk.
[31:39] What happened? You come. Come.
[31:41] Move.
[31:45] Oh man.
[33:04] I had told you then,
 you should have come up
[33:06] and saved yourself from getting beaten.
[33:09] Does it hurt?
[33:11] You know, grandma has a heavy hand.
[33:13] Please,
[33:15] you leave me alone for a little while.
[33:22] Is it her?
[33:27] You know, there is something,
[33:31] one minute,
[33:32] is Najia standing there and listening?
[33:37] These extramarital affairs have an advantage,
[33:43] when a person is getting insulted at home,
[33:46] he can get bandage done from outside.
[33:47] Please man!
[33:49] Hey, I was joking to fix your mood.
[33:52] Fix my mood?
[33:53] What will I do to fix my mood, 
when nothing else is getting fixed.
[33:58] When you have put your hand in the bee hive,
 then face all this.
[34:03] This much hell had to be raised
[34:06] and now more will happen
 if you stay strong on what you have said,
[34:11] obviously, this thing will get out of the house,
[34:13] you will have to listen to a lot more,
[34:15] you are already worried.
[34:21] I am worried thinking about something else.
[34:25] What?
[34:28] Tell me something,
[34:32] why is she doing all this?
[34:35] What all this?
[34:39] Why is she supporting me?
[34:42] why is she helping me?
[34:44] why is she taking my side in front of everyone?
[34:47] Why is she doing all this?
[34:50] I can answer this question,
[34:55] but I want that you find 
the answer for this question yourself,
[35:00] ask yourself.
[35:05] Is it friendship or sympathy?
[35:08] Look for it.
[35:09] Look for it, look for the answer, Umar.
[35:12] You will find it.
[35:14] I know
[35:16] but I want that you find out yourself.
[35:23] Good luck!
