[00:20] The question that Maheen asked,
I want to ask the same question with me,
[00:26] after all , why I am happy,
[00:28] what is the thing that will satisfy me?
[00:32] With Roshni as well I have a feeling of crime
[00:38] and when I am with Maheen as well,
[00:41] I have regrets.
[01:17] I thought that I will also make
my night black like you,
[01:23] maybe, the burden of the
heart will be less by this,
[01:29] will it be?
[01:36] Do we get any answer from there?
[01:42] Brother, I am already worried;
[01:45] please don’t make me more worried.
[01:49] I am also worried.
[01:51] So you can go in your room and get worried,
what are you doing here?
[01:57] Great,
[02:00] you have not asked why I am worried?
[02:04] Any ways,
[02:06] I am your big brother,
[02:09] tell me what is the problem?
[02:17] The same thing,
[02:21] you still miss her?
[02:27] The problem is not that I miss her,
[02:30] the pain
[02:33] that I can tolerate.
[02:38] Then?
[02:42] You still meet her.
[02:49] This is the problem,
[02:53] the one who have left you and ran away,
you are running after her.
[02:56] She is running,
[03:00] I am just supporting her,
[03:06] brother,
[03:08] I broke her heart,
[03:12] I backed off from my promise,
[03:15] I betrayed her,
[03:20] I am very much ashamed,
[03:24] if I meet her is just because
so that I can wipe her tears,
[03:30] what should I do?
[03:34] You tell me, what should I do?
[03:37] Should I leave her crying,
and is desperation?
[03:43] When you will stop wiping her tears,
[03:48] she will not have tears.
[03:49] I wish,
[03:53] I wish this will happen,
[03:55] she will forget me, she starts hating me,
[03:57] she start thinking that I am bad,
[04:02] but poor she,
[04:06] she loves me, she loves the person, like me,
who is a coward and disloyal as well.
[04:15] If she would have loved you,
[04:17] she would never be the problem for you,
[04:21] she would have make your worries goes,
she would have been separated with you.
[04:24] Brother,  you don’t know anything,
[04:26] you just leave it.
[04:31] You are right,
[04:33] I don’t know anything,
[04:36] you know everything,
[04:39] because you are intelligent,
[04:44] Umar just think about Maheen.
[04:51] I do think of her,
[04:54] what do you think that
I don’t think of Maheen,
[04:57] I do, that is why this is my condition,
[04:59] that is why I am uncomfortable,
[05:02] otherwise, why would it
makes any difference to me,
[05:05] I would have put all the blame on her head
and I would live a peaceful life,
[05:11] but brother how do you know,
[05:13] that what is the feeling
when you will get to know that
[05:16] because of you two people are unhappy,
[05:19] you are doing injustice to both,
[05:21] two people are worried because of you,
you tried a lot but still you cannot do anything,
[05:31] sometimes I think that I swear brother,
[05:33] I kill myself,
[05:35] so that the way I live and
die every day, it will get finish.
[05:41] You are more coward than me,
[05:45] in fact , always used to
like the bravery of yours,
[05:53] just forget her,
[05:57] the person, who is not in your fate,
there is no point running after her,
[06:02] Maheen is attached to your fate,
[06:06] so just accept her by heart,
[06:09] she is a nice girl.
[06:10] when did I say, that she is a bad girl,
[06:13] I never said that,
[06:18] but what will I do for my heart,
[06:22] that beats just for her,
[06:29] brother, I cannot leave her,
[06:33] I cannot live without her,
[06:40] just pray for me,
[06:43] that she will leave me,
[06:46] she will forget me and hates me,
[06:51] she will let me free from her love.
[07:41] After lot of courage and thought,
[07:47] I have made a decision,
[07:52] it was very difficult
[07:55] and I was in pain too but.
[08:00] The decision that you made,
[08:03] must be right,
[08:08] I have no rights to have
any complains with you.
[08:13] Just listen first what I am saying?
[08:17] what?
[08:18] I still not think about myself,
[08:22] I thought about just you ,
[08:29] and I have taken this decision for you.
[08:32] For me, Roshni,
[08:35] what decision?
[08:38] For your peace , your life
[08:43] and your happiness,
[08:53] I have taken the decision Umar that,
[08:58] I am letting you free from my love.
[09:06] Roshni.
[09:07] Now it makes no difference Umar,
[09:12] no matter if your heart loves me,
[09:16] but now you are belongs to Maheen,
[09:20] she is my friend, I cannot take her rights.
[09:24] what rights Roshni?
[09:26] She never asked for any right of her.
[09:28] If she never asked, then what happened?
[09:30] she do have a right on you.
[09:42] This is your right to get yourself satisfied,
[09:46] what I want and what I don’t want,
[09:51] just leave it.
[09:58] Mansoor,
[10:03] if you are thinking like this,
[10:05] so we will not go.
[10:09] Yes,
[10:12] so that you and the other people will
also think that there is something
[10:19] that I want to hide and
that is why I am not going,
[10:22] no Najia,
[10:25] if you think this way,
[10:28] so it is fine,
[10:30] you can be satisfied
[10:34] and you can take this
doubt out from your heart.
[11:03] Are you sure Roshni,
[11:06] do you know what are you saying?
[11:09] I have taken this decision
after thinking a lot
[11:13] and world do not get agree
for the relation of hearts Umar,
[11:17] our relationship holds no
 importance in front of this world,
[11:20] your and Maheen’s relationship is very strong,
[11:26] so why are we serving this
relation which is nothing?
[11:29] We just meet once in a week like thieves,
[11:33] if we talk to each other and
give satisfaction to each other, what will we get?
[11:37] Apart from being defamed and blames.
[11:40] Roshni, I told you that
[11:42] I will take some way out, I will talk,
[11:45] I just asked you for some time.
[11:49] I don’t have the courage
to ruin the house of Maheen,
[11:53] you will be bad in front of your family
[11:57] and I will be a second woman.
[12:02] You don’t want that
you will ruin the life of her,
[12:05] but you want to ruin your life,
[12:08] you have that courage?
[12:11] I have to be courageous,
[12:15] the whole life curse of Maheen
and to put you in pain,
[12:18] it is better that
I will take on the pains on my head,
[12:28] it is my prayer that
[12:31] you and Maheen will be happy forever,
[12:35] and I know that what I am doing does not
decrease the amount of your pain, it will increase,
[12:44] but I will be happy no matter
what will happen
[12:48] so that you will never think that
you have ruined the life of Roshni.
[12:53] Roshni,
[12:54] Roshni, please, you.
[12:56] Just listen to me,
[12:59] I will take care of my heart,
[13:03] but if I will miss you ever
or maybe I recall you,
[13:11] so can I call you sometime?
[13:14] Can I talk to you,
if you want I will meet Maheen now
[13:15] and I will talk to her,
[13:20] can I love his Umar by
heart until my breathing?
[13:29] Roshni,
[13:30] why are you testing your patience,
[13:32] why do you want to see my helplessness,
[13:35] for God sake,
[13:39] okay, just stop please, Roshni.
[13:52] I pray that you and Maheen will be happy
[13:58] and you will forget me,
[14:03] Bye.
[15:12] Najia,
[15:15] if the reports are against me then?
[15:19] If doctor said that
I will never be a father then?
[15:24] Mansoor, why are you thinking like that,
[15:26] please don’t think negative
maybe it will be a good news.
[15:30] it can be possible,
[15:31] anything can happen,
[15:34] but if Najia you,
[15:37] please Najia tell me,
[15:39] will you leave me?
[15:41] Mansoor.
[15:43] Please tell me Najia, will you leave me?
[15:46] You just take the car back,
I want to go back home.
[15:48] Najia, I am just asking a question from you.
[15:50] I don’t want any answer from any question,
[15:53] I don’t want any reports and
I don’t want to show it to any doctor,
[15:56] you just take the car back,
or I will just get down.
[15:58] No, I am taking the car back,
[16:01] we are going back home,
[16:02] I am moving the car, okay.
[16:31] I was thinking if she will leave me,
everything will be fine,
[16:35] why It seems,  that she has taken
my breathes with her while she left,
[16:41] if her infinite love
will goes away from my life,
[16:45] so what will be left with me?
[17:33] Roshni.
[17:46] You both have come.
[17:50] Najia,
[17:53] what happened?
[18:00] What happened?
[18:03] Where is Mansoor,
[18:04] he did not come?
[18:08] Najia,
[18:13] Najia,
[18:19] Oh God.
[19:39] How are you?
[19:40] I am fine and you?
[19:43] I am fine,
[19:46] you look worried by looking at me.
[19:50] Worried?
[19:55] I can see you on your face,
[19:58] you cannot hide it,
[20:02] I have seen as well and Umar as well.
[20:07] Umar?
[20:09] Yes,
[20:10] the scare of your heart and your pain,
[20:14] I came here to finish this scare of yours.
[20:17] which scare?
[20:20] That I will take Umar from you.
[20:29] I don’t have any scare like that,
[20:34] and how will you snatch Umar from me,
[20:37] he was never mine,
[20:40] he still loves you .
[20:44] And you know all this and
you are staying at his house,
[20:48] you are his wife,
[20:50] and you want to be his wife,
[20:53] what does that means?
[20:55] That you have the wish that one day,
he will be yours,
[21:03] so I came here to complete this wish of yours,
[21:07] you don’t need to wait for now,
[21:10] I came here to free Umar from my love forever,
[21:16] because of you.
[21:34] You are here?
[21:36] Where were you?
[21:39] Umar,
[21:45] what happened?
[21:49] are you worried?
[22:01] Look Umar if you and
Maheen have any problem.
[22:04] Father, why do you think that
I only have this problem in my life,
[22:09] yes, I do have this problem,
[22:11] but because of this one problem,
[22:13] I have so many problems born in my life,
[22:20] but you should be happy father,
[22:23] on the day of judgment you
will be in peace in front of uncle,
[22:27] you are so famous in the family
that your son is obedient,
[22:33] you said once and
he said yes for the wedlock,
[22:36] and the future of your niece is secure now,
[22:39] now it is my problem,
[22:42] I am concerned about that,
[22:44] why you have any concern in that.
[22:46] Umar son.
[23:16] These are the tears of happiness?
[23:21] Roshni, don’t do this,
[23:24] his heart will break badly.
[23:27] It is already,
[23:29] he is not happy now,
[23:30] we all three are not happy,
[23:33] at least you will be happy with this decision,
[23:37] Umar and me have thought that
we cannot give you more pain.
[23:42] I will not get any happiness
to get you both separated.
[23:48] You have separated us already,
[23:51] and now we are getting apart,
[23:54] look,
[23:56] Umar will be press in between us,
[23:59] he cannot give me pain neither you ,
[24:03] all the pains he is taking alone,
[24:06] we have two ways only for this,
[24:08] either you leave him,
[24:12] or I leave him,
[24:14] there is no force,
[24:17] I have to think about it because I love him.
[24:29] I have said this to Umar repeatedly,
[24:32] that don’t get worried because of me,
[24:35] I have no pain,
[24:38] I am happy in my life
[24:41] and I have accepted this reality that
[24:47] you and Umar.
[24:48] This is the whole problem
that you are happy,
[24:51] you are happy by living in this house,
you are happy that you are his wife,
[24:54] you are happy that
you name is in front of his name,
[24:57] what is the meaning of all this,
[25:00] that means you consider him your husband
[25:05] and I cannot takes anyone husband from her,
[25:09] I don’t want that
Umar loves you in front of your eyes,
[25:16] you should have say no being her wife,
[25:19] so it must be understandable,
[25:29] anyways,
[25:32] Umar cannot forget me
[25:35] and he cannot loves you ,
[25:38] and you don’t want love,
[25:40] you just need a husband
[25:43] and I am giving that to you ,
[25:49] you will not say anything?
[25:54] What will I say?
[25:56] I have said everything,
[25:58] but you are not agreeing to it,
[26:01] Roshni,
[26:03] if you would be at my place,
so what would you have done?
[26:05] Thank God, I am not at your place,
[26:09] I have the love of Umar
[26:13] and I am proud,
[26:15] that I am giving your my love,
[26:18] I am not snatching it from anyone,
[26:21] if I would be at your place Maheen,
I would have killed myself,
[26:24] that I have a person for
the whole life who cannot be mine,
[26:32] I cannot live the life which has
been given to me as a benefit,
[26:38] take care of yourself.
[28:02] Why not anyone tell me what happened?
[28:05] everyone is sitting with down face,
[28:09] here you are here sitting with down face,
[28:11] there Najia is breaking the glass,
[28:13] or shutting the doors to tell me
that she is on fire right now,
[28:20] the friend of Maheen has gone,
[28:21] so she is there sitting in the room with door close,
[28:24] here a Fareed has come home and he is also worried
[28:26] and he went inside the room,
[28:27] tell me what is going on?
[28:31] Just stay silent; please For God sake,
[28:34] God forbid if anything happens.
[28:37] And this Umar and Mansoor,
[28:40] where are they?
Why have not they come yet?
[28:44] No one is telling me anything.
[29:31] He is not yours,
[29:33] he loves me,
[29:36] you know all this still you are living with him?
[29:40] you are being his wife?
[30:01] Umar will be press in between us,
[30:04] he cannot give me pain neither you,
all the pains he is taking alone,
[30:11] we have two ways only for this,
[30:14] either you leave him,
[30:16] or I leave him,
[30:18] there is no force,
[30:21] I have to think about it because I love him,
[30:32] Thank God, I am not at your place,
[30:35] I have the love of Umar
[30:40] and I am proud,
[30:41] that I am giving your my love,
[30:45] I am not snatching it from anyone,
[30:48] if I would be at your place Maheen,
I would have killed myself,
[30:51] that I have a person for
the whole life who cannot be mine,
[31:38] You have played a big game Roshni,
[31:42] if that will not happen what you are thinking,
[31:46] if you will come to know that
[31:47] Umar and Maheen thanks to God
and went on honey moon,
[32:08] no,
[32:10] it cannot happen,
[32:13] I know Maheen since childhood,
[32:16] I know , which vein has to be pressed at what time,
[32:21] she will do the same thing ,
what I have thought.
[32:56] Umar,
[32:58] Roshni came,
[33:02] she was saying.
[33:03] Whatever she was saying,
I don’t want to know,
[33:05] you don’t need to repeat that,
[33:08] I will be in pain,
[33:11] and what she have done was
because of you and me,
[33:16] just be happy now.
[33:17] I will be happy to give you pain,
I will be happy?
[34:17] Just leave any corner of the house so that
a person can get worried while being alone.
[34:27] You just think that I am not here,
[34:31] you can get worried,
[34:33] I will not interfere in anything.
[34:39] You can go down and get worried.
[34:42] There is father downstairs,
[34:45] I am hiding myself from him,
[34:52] why don’t you go in your room and get worried?
[34:56] There we have Najia,
[34:58] and I am hiding myself from him,
[35:02] I have done a strange act with her in the morning,
[35:07] now I don’t have courage to face her.
[35:14] I am also hiding from father,
[35:19] he have many questions for me.
[35:27] Umar,
[35:30] how our parents have up brought us,
[35:35] if we hurt someone,
[35:38] we hide our face from them,
[35:42] I don’t know who are those people
who hurt someone and they are in peace.
[35:51] You are saying right,
[35:54] I don’t know, how people can be
happy while giving pain to others.
[36:03] Did you hurt anyone?
[36:16] I do not know,
[36:19] maybe.
