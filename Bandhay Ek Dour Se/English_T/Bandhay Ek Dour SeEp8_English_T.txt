[00:20] Maheen,
[00:23] Maheen.
[00:27] Your fever is not going down,
[00:30] no medication is working.
[00:33] Get up.
[00:34] Get up.
[00:35] I feel dizzy sister in law.
[00:37] yes, must be cause of
the fever or medication.
[00:42] Come on get up, have breakfast,
then you need to go the parlor.
[00:50] parlor.
[00:51] won’t you go to the parlor?
Won’t you be a bride?
[01:03] Bride?
[01:04] What?
[01:06] Last night they left,
[01:09] did the issue get sorted?
[01:10] Yes all is sorted, in fact it’s great.
[01:22] Is mama getting them a car?
[01:25] Has she put the home on the line?
Sister in law, say no. Say no to them.
[01:30] To hell with those people.
[01:31] Their useless wishes.
[01:34] The reason  you got fever,
[01:37] that is fine.
[01:40] Get up and get ready,
then see the surprise God has for you.
[01:46] If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise.
[01:50] You can see for yourself.
Come on get up.
[01:53] I have given you a glimpse of happiness
and your fever has gone down.
[01:58] Once you get complete happiness, you will fly.
[02:02] Come on, get up and get ready.
[02:05] Should I get you breakfast?
[02:22] If it’s a matter of Mahi’s life,
it’s a matter of my life too.
[02:27] Marrying her if a lot of
people are getting happiness,
[02:31] me and Roshni are getting sad.
[02:39] And then I can face this sorrow,
[02:42] how do I shock Roshni?
[03:41] Mahi, where is Mahi,
[03:44] I want to talk to her
about something important.
[03:47] Okay, Mahi is at the parlor to get ready
[03:54] and whatever important things
you have say them together.
[03:58] Ok? Go now.
[04:09] Yes uncle, you are our elder.
[04:12] It was not possible without consulting you
[04:15] but the situation was such.
Yes, I know.
[04:18] Razia..
[04:19] Yes, she is Murad’s last sign,
[04:22] an orphan and then someone as
obedient as Umar has made us happy.
[04:32] Thank God.
[04:35] Here you go.
[04:37] what is this?
[04:38] for you.
[04:41] Mama, but…
[04:42] Razia, you have made me happy,
[04:46] you accepted my decision.
[04:50] Okay, so in this haste,
I got this sherwani, it’s really good.
[04:55] wow.
[04:56] Its fine, right?
[05:28] Be happy today.
[05:35] sister in law
[05:36] I am really worried,
[05:39] what are you people doing with me?
[05:41] What if you take a wrong
decision for me in haste.
[05:46] You think too much,
[05:49] whatever is happening is good.
[05:51] Now prepare her quickly
or we will get calls from home.
[05:58] Prepare so that the groom
cannot take his eyes off her.
[06:13] I got your curse Umar,
[06:16] I don’t know what you went
through when Maheen told you..
[06:26] maybe you were in
the same pain I am in,
[06:33] maybe a little more.
[06:37] It must be more,
[06:41] which is why you didn’t
say anything to me.
[06:50] No complain, no sarcasm,
then how can I say you cursed me.
[06:56] You sit here calmly,
[06:59] the groom family must be coming.
[09:21] I will get you water.
[09:23] listen,
Call sister in law Najia
[09:25] She is on the other side.
[09:27] What do you mean?
[09:28] She was on the bride’s side,
[09:31] now she is caring
for the groom’s side.
[09:33] I will get water.
[09:43] Fine. Fine.
[09:48] mama,
[09:49] what is Fazeela saying
about sister in law, Najia?
[09:52] Is it her relative? Who is it?
[09:54] God bless,
[09:56] you look so pretty.
[09:59] May God give you a good fate.
[10:02] My fears are all gone,
[10:08] I was scared giving a piece
of my heart to strangers,
[10:13] but my worries are gone.
[10:17] Umar will ensure you are fine.
[10:23] Umar?
[10:25] God give him a long life,
[10:26] he is a good boy,
he cares for everyone,
[10:29] loves everyone.
[10:31] I never even dreamed
I will get such a good son in law.
[10:37] Then on top of that a father like uncle.
[10:40] You are not going to your in-laws,
[10:42] just moving from one home to another.
[10:45] Najia will be there to care for you,
[10:49] your sister like sister in law,
[10:51] then Razia’s temper, she has a good
heart though, she loves you a lot.
[10:59] On top of that Umar.
[11:03] mama..
[11:04] Yes, my love.
[11:06] Mama,
[11:09] Umar…
[11:09] Mama, uncle wants to
come in with the priest.
[11:11] Yes, let them come in.
[11:21] Ma…
[11:59] yes Razia, tell Zakia to prepare
to send her daughter off.
[12:05] Mama, I didn’t think of that,
[12:09] the wedding got done,
[12:11] but where will we make Mahi stay?
[12:14] Have you seen the
condition of Umar’s room?
[12:16] what is there to worry about?
[12:18] She will stay in my
room for 2 nights.
[12:20] What are you saying?
[12:21] Will we have the bride
stay in temporary rooms?
[12:24] what bride? She is your daughter,
[12:26] don’t be so formal.
She is going to her home.
[12:30] this is not a formality,
but preparations.
[12:34] Najia was saying she will take
Mansoor home before we leave, she will fix it all.
[12:40] Thank God someone
is smart about it.
[12:44] She cannot do it,
have you seen her room?
[12:46] Mama, I will.
[12:47] She will do it,
nothing to worry about.
[12:51] What happened?
[12:54] Umar, what happened?
[12:55] Nothing,
[12:56] I was suffocated.
[13:00] I am going to the roof.
[13:02] Yes, go.
[13:03] oh, my son got the evil eye.
[13:07] Brother, I called those
people on your instructions.
[13:11] I told them everything clearly.
[13:13] They didn’t say a word.
[13:15] I told them to send
back the dowry as is,
[13:18] I have sent Monis,
I hope they send it back as is.
[13:23] Zakia, that is dependent
on their intentions,
[13:27] if there is something lacking 
don’t create a scene.
[13:31] Thank God, He saved our daughter.
[13:35] Consider it charity for the daughter.
[13:39] Farid is right.
[13:44] Najia…
[14:03] Roshni, it’s good you weren’t here,
[14:06] you won’t have been able to take it
[14:09] and it would have been really
difficult for me to face you.
[14:15] You were right,
[14:17] I am not capable of doing anything.
I cannot do anything.
[14:36] Umar,
[14:38] what are you doing here?
Everyone is waiting for you downstairs,
[14:47] it’s time to leave.
[14:51] You know I shouldn’t say this,
[14:55] but I am a brother.
[14:57] Look, if
Mahi says something wrong
[15:02] or does something
you don’t like, forgive her.
[15:05] Ok?
[15:09] Thank you. Shall we?
[15:26] Okay my love,
[15:29] this is now your mother’s home,
[15:31] come here as a guest.
[15:35] It’s time for you to leave.
[15:40] Mama,
[15:43] I need to talk to you.
[15:45] they are waiting for you outside,
[15:47] you come tomorrow
evening with Umar, we will talk.
[15:52] Mama, its important.
[15:55] Go ahead.
[15:58] Mama,
[16:01] Umar…
[16:05] why do you want to
talk to me about Umar?
[16:08] Do your talking with Umar.
[16:12] Mama,
[16:14] he, Roshni…
[16:17] Why mention Roshni here?
[16:20] I got scared what the issue is
[16:23] and you are missing Roshni.
[16:26] To hell with her.
[16:27] She didn’t even stay for your wedding
and you are crying for her.
[16:34] Look Mahi,
[16:36] leave memories and friendships back.
[16:42] Razia may be good but her temper is bad,
[16:46] she forget everything quickly.
[16:49] She won’t take long to become
a mother in law from her aunt.
[16:54] Forget this,
[16:57] I am already under the
burden of their favors.
[17:00] Now see,
[17:02] make sure they don’t complain.
[17:08] Fazeela,
[17:10] bring the veil to send
the daughter away.
[18:31] Come on, play the music!
[19:17] Roshni, stop it,
how much will you cry.
[19:23] See I was so worried that
you are traveling alone.
[19:30] Tell me, why did
you leave suddenly?
[19:35] mama, I told you,
[19:37] I missed you, this home.
[19:44] you missed us all of a sudden?
[19:46] Tell me honestly,
did someone say something?
[19:50] What can anyone say to me?
[19:53] I am telling you,
I couldn’t stay there.
[19:57] fine, don’t tell me,
[19:59] I will ask Shazia myself.
[20:01] In fact she called yesterday ,
[20:04] I was in Maheen’s function so
I couldn’t talk to her about the proposal.
[20:11] mama, don’t call her and
if she calls don’t talk to her.
[20:23] But why?
[20:24] because I told you.
[20:28] If you stay quiet, they will
know it’s a no from us.
[20:33] no from us?
[20:35] Oh God, but you were restless…
[20:39] I was mad.
[20:44] When I went there,
stayed for a few days,
[20:50] I realized those people
are separate from us,
[20:54] we don’t have match
with them, they are rich.
[21:04] That’s what I was trying to tell you,
but you didn’t get it.
[21:13] Even if that boy is good,
[21:16] he is well educated,
[21:19] he has lived abroad.
[21:22] You know in a few days he would
have found so many issues
[21:28] and Shazia,
[21:30] she has become a
madam after getting wealth.
[21:35] What didn’t change
is your mother,
[21:38] I am plain.
[21:39] yes mama,
[21:42] that is why I took out this
thought from my head,
[21:45] you too stop thinking.
[21:52] Okay forget it all and rest.
[21:56] You must be tired,
[21:59] you are traveling since morning.
I will make you something you like.
[22:07] Fine.
[22:41] Umar must be here,
[22:43] it will be easier to convince him.
[22:45] He is stupid,
[22:48] I will just say I did it to bother him
and make him jealous,
[22:53] he will agree immediately.
[23:11] Right foot first. Come on.
[23:13] Mama leave these customs,
come on
[23:17] God bless.
[23:21] Where is Umar?
[23:23] He went out.
He must have gone to meet friends.
[23:27] Must have gone to tell friends.
[23:31] Najia..
[23:32] Mama, Najia is fixing
the bride’s room.
[23:36] Okay.
[23:38] Mama, I wanted to take her upstairs,
[23:41] she must be tired.
[23:42] When the locality finds out they
will come to congratulate us.
[23:47] Yes, they can come as
many times as they want
[23:50] but they won’t see the bride’s
face before reception.
[23:53] mama, how can I say no?
[23:56] I am worried about my siblings,
[23:59] they will get upset.
[24:01] what is there to get upset about,
we told them we are helpless.
[24:04] Why won’t they get upset?
[24:06] They are uncle and aunts,
[24:08] they were not part of the wedding,
they will surely get upset.
[24:11] these people will just complain,
[24:14] take her to the room,
[24:15] Najia is taking so long.
Take her.
[24:18] we have the child
standing here for so long.
[24:22] Careful child. Come
[24:27] Thank God.
[26:24] Umar,
what are you doing here?
[26:27] what are you doing here?
[26:30] Papa asked me to look for you,
[26:33] I asked your friends,
[26:35] but I knew I would find you here.
[26:39] I saw your bike here,
[26:43] come home, everyone is waiting…
[26:45] I don’t want to go, you go.
[26:48] umar, what is your problem?
[26:49] Problem?
[26:52] You are asking me this right now?
[26:57] You made a such a big decision
of my life without asking me,
[26:59] no one asked me my issue then.
[27:03] No one thought I am a living being,
I have some hopes.
[27:08] No one does this to girls nowadays.
[27:12] You forcefully got me tied to the
door like a sacrificial animal.
[27:16] That too forcefully.
[27:19] Forcefully?
[27:20] Now everyone wants me
to act like I am happy.
[27:24] I should sing and dance like
you people did me a favor.
[27:30] One minute, Umar. One minute.
[27:35] I thought you would dance in happiness.
[27:40] Don’t you like Maheen?
[27:42] it’s not about liking or disliking anyone.
[27:45] What is it that she lacks that I don’t like her.
[27:48] This is not the issue.
[27:52] In fact,
[27:53] I have no complains from her,
[27:56] she has no fault.
[27:58] When she couldn’t say anything,
how could I?
[28:02] But can I not complain to you people.
[28:05] One minute Umar,
[28:08] I don’t get what you are trying to say.
[28:12] You love Mahi…
[28:15] you wanted to marry her?
[28:18] We all felt this was your wish.
[28:23] What?
[28:25] You people thought 
it was my wish?
[28:26] Yes, what else?
[28:30] mama.
[28:33] Mama.
[28:33] Yes?
[28:36] You didn’t get ready?
[28:38] No, and why are you 
so dressed up?
[28:42] Today is Maheen’s wedding,
don’t you want to go?
[28:45] Wedding?
[28:46] That was done,
[28:48] and she went away too,
just before you came.
[28:52] the situation was
such that they had to do it early.
[28:55] The boys family had weird
demands on the Hena night.
[29:01] mama, I will ask the rest of
the story from sister Zakia.
[29:04] Listen, I am telling you,
she went away.
[29:07] Aunt Zakia will be there,
[29:09] I will hear the rest of the story from her
and also the guests will be there. I am going, bye.
[29:13] come back soon.
[29:16] She doesn’t get it.
[29:38] we thought…
[29:39] Brother Mansoor, I don’t know
what made you people think this,
[29:42] what action of mine
made you think this.
[30:00] okay,
fine I had a misunderstanding,
[30:04] the wrong estimate I gave papa,
[30:08] he was satisfied to make the decision.
[30:13] Mama thought about
you agreeing and gave up.
[30:23] But Umar, think,
[30:26] if I didn’t have this misunderstanding
[30:29] and I had not given papa confidence,
[30:33] then wouldn’t they make this decision?
[30:38] They still would have done it
[30:41] but they did it with a light heart
[30:45] and no mental pressure.
[30:50] Then they would have done it out
of helplessness, embarrassed in front of you,
[30:55] but
[30:57] they would have done what happened now.
[31:01] Imagine, if you were asked,
[31:04] what answer would you have?
[31:07] You would have said no,
[31:09] but for how long?
[31:15] You would in the end had to do this.
[31:29] now what had to happen, happened.
[31:31] Why and
how is a useless argument,
[31:36] it’s best you come home.
[32:46] Come.
[32:48] Wish you had come early,
[32:49] Maheen left a little while
back asking about you.
[32:53] I thought I would come on the
right time and surprise her,
[32:57] but I got the surprise.
[32:58] The wedding was during the night,
how did it get done during the day.
[33:02] didn’t your mother tell you?
[33:06] She did, so I am asking you,
[33:08] also the home feels so sad,
doesn’t look like a wedding home.
[33:15] the home where the girl
goes from it becomes sad,
[33:19] so does the heart.
[33:20] Have all the guests left?
[33:22] Long time back.
[33:24] will you eat something?
[33:25] No, I don’t want to meet anything.
[33:27] Maheen’s grandma,
[33:30] she came so before the wedding,
[33:32] she should have stayed after too.
[33:36] what will she do living here?
[33:39] That is the wedding
home now honestly.
[33:42] I got free from my
responsibility with peace of mind,
[33:45] they had to make
the arrangements.
[33:48] Arrangements for what?
[33:51] Brother took 2 days to the reception
[33:54] but still, it was sudden for them,
there is an issue.
[33:59] Should I make you tea?
[34:01] no, I won’t like it if you make tea.
[34:04] Yes,
[34:05] Mahi is not here to care for you,
[34:08] but don’t worry,
[34:10] she will visit often.
[34:12] This is the advantage
of marrying in the family.
[34:15] I think Umar won’t be the type
who would put restrictions on his wife.
[34:20] You are Frank with him too.
[34:23] Umar?
[34:25] he is no stranger for you,
[34:27] you can go meet Mahi when you want
not considering it her in laws home,
[34:32] but her uncle’s.
[36:18] Everyone was up,
[36:20] I think they slept early.
[36:26] You come Umar, come.
[36:43] except for Maheen.
[36:48] Najia was saying she is crying continuously.
[36:57] Look Umar,
[36:58] the thing these people think,
let them think that.
[37:06] I am not saying
[37:09] it cause I will come across as a liar,
I am saying it because
[37:14] papa and aunt will lose their peace,
[37:20] they will consider
themselves as culprits.
[37:22] Brother, I won’t do
anything like that.
[37:25] in all this Maheen has no fault,
[37:30] so please don’t torture her.
[37:36] Coming to a girl’s life in
this way is painful for her.
[37:48] Saying anything to anyone will
do nothing for me, nothing will change.
[37:54] I know this.
