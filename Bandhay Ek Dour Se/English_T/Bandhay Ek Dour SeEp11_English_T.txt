[00:30] see this mama,
all this is Mahi’s jewelry.
[00:34] Get it polished,
there is no shine.
[00:39] Mama, it is still gold,
there was no time.
[00:45] People will see it and know it’s
at least 15-20 tolas and Zakia,
[00:50] she gave her nothing
[00:54] Those people were imbeciles,
[00:57] they had told Zakia that there
should be at least 6-7 sets.
[01:00] She with difficulty
[01:02] and adding her own gold
was able to make 12 tolas.
[01:07] Now 6 sets in 12 tolas
means nothing.
[01:11] thanksGod we got rid of those people or
they would have cursed for these sets.
[01:18] It’s just me who said nothing.
[01:21] Don’t say anything.
[01:24] Hello aunt.
[01:25] Hello. Hello my queen.
Come. Come sit.
[01:31] This Razia didn’t make you stuff
but she got great dresses for you
[01:38] see Maheen, these are all for you,
[01:41] mama says they don’t shine,
[01:44] we will give it to the jeweller after
the reception and get it polished
[01:52] Now Najia will get upset,
[01:54] you gave her 2 dresses and a set of gold.
[01:57] let her get upset,
I am upset at her.
[02:04] Okay, will you go show
her the dress or not?
[02:08] Yes mama, I will get it,
hold this.
[02:15] I will get it.
[02:20] what is it Maheen?
[02:22] You look upset, you don’t talk.
[02:28] No grandma, nothing like that.
[02:32] I apologize on Razia’s behalf,
[02:36] she said yes to me and Fareed and
she will take her anger out on you.
[02:42] Same she did with Najia.
[02:44] She is fine with you,
but you are away from her.
[02:53] No, I didn’t mean that grandma,
[02:59] I will try.
[03:01] Look, you are at no strangers,
[03:04] you have your grandma
and uncle here. ,
[03:10] Look child the sooner you
make a heart in Razia’s heart,
[03:15] the better.
[03:18] She runs the home,
[03:21] Faris and Umar are in her control.
[03:25] If she doesn’t like you,
then she will treat you like Najia.
[03:31] She is strong she stands up,
[03:34] what will you do?
[03:38] Yes grandma.
[03:45] Where do you go alone?
[03:47] I had some work
[03:48] what work?
That you had to go alone,
[03:51] you have never done that. I don’t like
you roaming out in the market like this,
[03:53] if you had asked me,
I would have come along.
[03:55] Have you ever gone
with me to the market?
[03:57] you used to go with Maheen
or the girls in the locality,
[04:01] what was the need to go alone?
[04:02] mama, should I have
Maheen stick with me?
[04:05] When she went to her in laws,
did she take me along that I take her?
[04:09] Hey Zakia came.
[04:13] So?
[04:15] It’s the reception, we have to go.
You be ready.
[04:21] Reception.
[04:22] Yes, Maheen’s. We have to go.
[04:24] mama they not invited in wedding
why we go Reception
[04:28] have you gone mad, Roshni?
[04:30] We were invited,
[04:32] you left everything and went to Shahista.
[04:35] but mama that wedding never happened.
[04:37] Did she call us to Umar’s wedding?
[04:40] She didn’t even let us know,
let alone invite us.
[04:43] Oh God, Roshni,
[04:44] I feel since you have come from
Shahista’s you have gone mad.
[04:50] I just told you everything
how hasty the wedding was.
[04:52] Now will you make this the reason to not
attend the wedding of your childhood friend.
[04:59] She had nothing in her control,
[05:04] not doing the wedding,
nor saying no.
[05:07] why didn’t she have control?
[05:09] She could have said mo,
[05:11] but madam got ready
that too to get married.
[05:15] Roshni,
I cannot reason with you.
[05:25] Cunning woman.
[05:45] I was tied to your promises,
[05:48] I trusted you.
[05:49] I thought even late but you will
definitely live up to your promises.
[05:53] Then how could I get
tied with someone else.
[05:58] I didn’t give up like you,
I stood up,
[06:02] I said no.
[06:06] Being a weak girl
I still lived up to my promises.
[06:11] What do I tell her? What do I say?
[06:14] The one who I did all this for,
he…
[06:44] Umar, where were you?
[06:46] I didn’t go to work,
[06:48] papa had asked me to take you shopping,
but I don’t know where you were.
[06:52] I forgot brother.
[06:54] amazing and what about the
calls and messages I sent?
[07:01] I don’t know the battery must be dead.
I don’t know.
[07:04] Okay, let’s go right now,
[07:06] it’s not even 10.
[07:08] No,
[07:11] we will go tomorrow.
[07:12] Hey, it’s your reception tomorrow,
we need to get a suit.
[07:16] The wedding was done in borrowed clothes,
[07:19] I will borrow clothes for the reception,
[07:22] what difference does it make.
[07:24] Umar, what is your problem?
[07:26] You have been married
[07:28] and it’s a good thing.
[07:31] Maheen is a good girl,
what are you mourning?
[07:37] tell me something,
[07:39] had mama married you to some other girl
she liked instead of sister in law Najia,
[07:44] then how would you react.
[07:46] I remember you went on a hunger strike,
have you forgotten.
[07:51] Man, my deal was different.
[07:53] I was committed to Najia,
[07:56] i couldn’t think of anyone apart from her,
[07:59] but what is your problem?
[08:02] I too am...
[08:08] you wont get it. leave it.
[08:43] Umar.
[08:45] Yeah?
[08:47] Look at this.
[08:51] This veil and this dress and
I am getting the same shirt made.
[08:57] Aunt got it made, its good, right?
[09:00] Yeah, good.
[09:02] Is your suit here?
[09:06] No, I will get it tomorrow.
[09:10] The function is in the afternoon tomorrow,
what time will you go,
[09:13] when will you come?
We have to get ready too.
[09:18] The way the wedding was done in a hurry,
[09:22] I will prepare the same way for the reception.
What difference does it make?
[09:28] Should I get you food?
[09:29] No,
[09:31] I will have tea.
[09:33] Let me make it.
[09:35] You know I don’t like tea you make.
[09:40] Give me these slippers.
Okay, leave it.
[09:55] Farid, look at Umar,
he is making tea.
[09:59] Yeah, so?
[10:01] He is married and see him,
[10:04] he is making tea.
[10:09] As far as I can recall, when he
was not married he made his own tea.
[10:14] That was different,
[10:15] but what will anyone say if they see him.
[10:22] The first thing, at 11 pm at night,
who will look in the kitchen,
[10:27] secondly,
[10:31] when did you care about someone?
[10:36] You remember mama had an
issue with the boys cooking,
[10:41] but you used to say that I will not spoil
my children by feeding them myself.
[10:48] Boys respect don’t reduce
by cooking and making tea.
[10:52] Oh God, you just need a
chance to take your mother’s side.
[10:57] They are my children,
[10:58] I will make them work when I want,
[11:00] but tell me one thing honestly,
[11:03] I have not made my husband
even have water himself.
[11:08] This is true,
[11:11] I used to get water sitting and along with
that sarcasm, that mama has spoilt you.
[11:18] No problem, it wont happen now.
[11:21] My sons wives wont complain,
in fact, they will praise you
[11:24] and say that the mother has
brought up such good kids.
[11:28] You always go against me
[11:31] and without thinking take the side of others.
[11:34] I didn’t mean that his wife
should make tea for him.
[11:39] I myself haven’t gotten her to make sweets,
I haven’t sent her to the kitchen,
[11:43] but think yourself,
this way girls get out of hand,
[11:47] today he is making tea for himself,
tomorrow he will make it for his wife.
[11:51] You are right,
[11:52] if you want,
I will go make you tea.
[11:54] No, I had it,
I cannot sleep after tea.
[11:59] Something else?
[12:00] I am not kidding,
[12:02] think of what I said,
people will say he is his wife’s pet.
[12:06] Yes.
[12:10] Oh well…
[12:55] I should have made
tea for you too, right?
[13:00] Should I make it right now?
[13:02] No, I don’t want it.
[13:05] Then why are you looking
at me like a greedy person.
[13:08] No. Just.
[13:11] Ok fine, lets split it.
[13:13] No. No. I don’t want it Umar,
you have it.
[13:15] Why? Cause I had it.
[13:20] Me and you are…
[13:23] One minute.
[13:24] We used to share ice cream,
remember?
[13:28] Yes, you used to eat it all
and I would only get the stick.
[13:35] No, you used to eat it all and
leave me a small piece.
[13:39] Liar.
[13:41] The tea is bad,
I could have made it better.
[13:45] That is why I make it myself
and have it myself.
[13:53] Okay listen.
[13:54] Yeah?
[13:56] Did you talk to Roshni?
[14:02] Tell me,
[14:05] did she tell you why she left at the time of
my wedding and where she went.
[14:11] Maheen, please.
[14:16] I had asked you we will not discuss this, then?
[14:25] When I am with you,
I want to remember that you are my cousin
[14:29] and my childhood friend,
[14:33] but talking about this,
[14:34] I feel you want to remind me that
we are not just friends, but something else.
[15:16] Oh God, that damned
Mukhtara didn’t come on time.
[15:20] Lazy bum.
[15:23] Hello aunt.
[15:25] Hello.
[15:28] Will you have tea?
[15:29] I am actually also making breakfast.
[15:31] When Umar is up,  will set it.
[15:34] Or will you two have it in the room?
[15:38] Why the room?
[15:39] We will have it with everyone.
[15:41] Tell me, is there something
I can help you with.
[15:43] You say weird things.
[15:45] I will not let you work,
[15:48] you are the bride,
its your reception today.
[15:51] Aunt, I have come to my own home,
[15:53] I used to work here earlier.
Come on tell me.
[15:59] It was different earlier,
[16:01] now you are the bride and
daughter in law of this home.
[16:07] Fine aunt,
[16:08] I used to consider
myself your daughter,
[16:12] I still do.
[16:14] Live long,
[16:20] haha…
[16:21] Go, come on, wake Umar up.
[16:23] If we don’t wake him up,
[16:25] he sleeps till the afternoon.
[16:26] Come on go,
[16:28] then you have to go to the parlour too.
[16:33] I missed you last night Umar,
[16:35] but I stopped myself from calling you
[16:38] and reminded myself that
you are someone else’s now.
[16:41] Doesn’t matter if I am still yours,
[16:44] you are not mine.
[16:47] Mine wouldn’t have liked that
[16:50] if you were with her
and you would talk to me.
[16:54] Her heart wouldn’t have shuddered one bit
adding my Umar’s name in front of her name,
[17:00] but Umar, I didn’t have the courage to take
away a moment from Maheen’s Umar.
[17:11] You are up?
[17:13] I was coming to wake you up.
[17:17] Mama and grandma are calling
you downstairs for breakfast.
[18:52] If Roshni can forgive all of
Umar’s mistakes and call her,
[18:58] his. Then how can
Umar call himself his.
[19:02] Every moment of mine is yours,
Roshni,
[19:05] even today and tomorrow,
[19:08] till forever.
[19:21] Mama,
[19:23] take out my heavy dress,
[19:26] I have to go to the reception,
[19:28] give me your earrings too,
I will wear them with it.
[20:07] you are doing what you want?
[20:10] Is this me doing what I want?
[20:13] If I was doing what I wanted,
all this wouldn’t have happened.
[20:23] Look Umar,
[20:26] what you told me yesterday,
if you had told me earlier,
[20:30] even if you would have stayed quiet,
I would have taken a stand for you.
[20:38] I am also responsible somehow,
[20:41] I wish I had not guessed incorrectly,
[20:45] but what had to happen, happened.
We cannot change it.
[20:51] If you have accepted her, then what is the
point of punishing yourself and Maheen.
[20:56] What do I do brother?
[20:58] Should I forget it all and
dance suddenly.
[21:05] No, I just want to say that you don’t
roam around with this sad face.
[21:09] Think about Maheen,
what is her fault in this?
[21:12] When did I say she is at fault?
[21:14] I know she was helpless,
[21:18] nor do I have complains with her.
[21:20] I am talking to her like I used to earlier,
[21:23] like a cousin, normally.
[21:29] this is wrong,
[21:33] you don’t have the same
relation with her like earlier.
[21:40] You are making a mistake by making
her realize that you two are just cousins.
[21:47] She is an innocent girl,
[21:50] she will be fooled by you even
if you just sympathize with her.
[21:55] You will take time to love her,
[21:58] then fake love.
[22:00] Not at all brother,
[22:02] this is not possible
[22:07] because I love someone else
[22:10] and Maheen knows her.
[26:04] Wow.
[26:16] Congratulations to you.
[26:25] How is the wedding going?
[26:27] You two look good, really good.
[26:30] What happened?
[26:32] I came to attend your wedding,
[26:35] why the long faces?
[26:44] Ok, lets take a selfie,
maybe you two will be happy.
[26:47] Lets take a selfie.
[26:49] Smile, Umar, Maheen.
[26:55] Hey, Umar,
[26:57] Maheen, the picture is not good here,
[27:00] I feel I will have to come in the middle.
[27:07] Maheen,
[27:08] you will give your best friend
room to sit in the middle, right?
[27:17] Of course you will,
I am your best friend. Move. Move.
[27:23] I think Umar,
you should take a selfie.
[27:25] Maheen, what do you think?
[27:28] Please. What?
[27:31] Ok, fine, what can I do?
I will have to fix a timer.
[27:35] Come on.
[27:38] Come on, set yourself.
[27:40] Cheese.
[27:44] Najia, I think we will come later,
it’s a function of the home,
[27:47] we will get the picture taken later.
Come on. Come.
[27:56] Roshni.
[27:57] Yes?
[27:57] Stop it now.
[28:00] The bride and groom have not gotten their pictures
taken this much that you are taking them.
[28:03] Come on. Move. Come down,
[28:06] there are more people waiting for
their pictures to be taken.
[28:10] This is my place,
if someone can move me, then try.
[28:17] This is nice
I will put this up on Snapchat.
[28:59] Yes.
[29:02] Look at this girl.
[29:06] She is really good,
such a show off.
[29:09] She is a show off.
I am sure she is Najia’s friend,
[29:13] not even her wedding,
but she is taking the limelight.
[29:16] Look at her. God knows who she is,
but she is on the stage.
[29:21] You don’t blame Najia for everything.
[29:24] This is not Najia’s friend,
she is Maheen’s childhood friend,
[29:29] what was her name?
[29:31] I don’t remember her name.
She lives next door to Razia.
[29:34] She is a show off,
she is acting extra special today.
[29:38] Is she married?
[29:39] No, not right now.
[29:41] Look at her,
[29:42] she is so dressed up, such a heavy dress,
does it look good on single girls?
[29:47] Tell me.
[29:48] Show off.
[30:43] Mansoor.
[30:43] Yes?
[30:43] Mansoor, that….
[30:45] Come on papa lets take a picture.
[30:47] Yes, the picture is necessary.
[30:52] Smile papa.
[30:53] I will, but where is Umar?
Where is he?
[30:56] He went to the washroom.
[30:58] You get your picture taken,
don’t be tensed.
[31:00] Yes.
[31:11] Umar?
[31:14] Hello.
[31:15] what are you doing?
[31:17] What happened? What did I do?
[31:20] Why did you come here?
[31:21] Oh,
[31:23] are you scared?
[31:26] hummm,
[31:28] I am not scared.
[31:31] Yes, I am scared for you.
[31:35] This drama of being happy,
[31:38] what if you get sad cause of it.
[31:40] That is why I worry for you.
[31:42] Why did you come here?
[31:44] Without a reason?
[31:47] Why are you testing your patience?
[31:50] Why are you tormenting me and yourself.
[31:53] Don’t do this,
[31:56] I am embarrassed,
[31:59] I am in pain that I did something
so bad to you and you are so good.
[32:06] Stop it Umar,
[32:07] you are scared cause of Maheen,
[32:11] what if she minds it,
or she finds out everything, right?
[32:21] Tell me something…
[32:25] What will she find out?
She knows it all.
[32:30] It was different earlier,
[32:32] she is your wife now.
[32:35] When your first love comes in front of his wife,
the person gets scared,
[32:39] just like you.
[32:42] Roshni,
Maheen is not just my friend,
[32:45] she is yours too,
that too childhood friend.
[32:48] She cannot get jealous of anyone,
she is a plain, innocent girl.
[32:54] If she doesn’t realize our love,
who will?
[32:59] I swear to God, she is sad.
[33:02] She is sadder than us,
that she came between us.
[33:07] Maheen is not plain,
nor is she innocent.
[33:11] Umar,
[33:12] I feel that you are stupid.
[33:15] Look, Maheen is a woman
[33:17] and a woman cannot share.
[33:21] Look at me,
[33:22] I am happily here to be
part of your happiness
[33:26] and look at her face for a moment,
[33:30] she has gone pale.
[33:33] Look Roshni, she…
[33:41] Man,
[33:42] she is my wife for the world,
[33:45] not for me.
[33:47] For me she is my friend,
my best friend from my childhood,
[33:51] someone I can share my happiness and sorrows with,
I can share everything with her.
[33:55] Okay,
[33:57] then go share your happiness
and sorrows with her,
[34:01] have you come here to tell
me Maheen’s greatness.
[34:03] Roshni, no I…
[34:04] That’s it.
[34:36] Do you remember my dowry,
[34:38] it was like they got
rid of a responsibility.
[34:42] And here,
[34:43] great dresses were made in 2 days.
[34:47] Old family jewels were given.
[34:51] My family said so much to me,
[34:54] that these are the
people you were dying to marry.
[34:58] Are these really those people?
[35:05] Yes,
[35:06] why would you speak
in my favour,
[35:09] but you will give
justifications for your mother.
[35:13] Ok, fine, this is to be done,
[35:16] I was from outside the family,
[35:18] Maheen is family.
[35:20] Fine, I agree they differentiated
between the two daughter in laws,
[35:24] but why the sons,
[35:25] they are their own, then why the difference?
[35:31] What happened?
[35:34] We did injustice Najia.
[35:36] Thank God,
[35:38] you finally realize that what
happened with us is injustice.
[35:44] Hey, no.
[35:49] Maheen and Umar.
[36:04] You look really good.
[36:08] This is what everyone said today, right?
[36:12] That is why you are not changing.
[36:14] I don’t know how girls wear
such heavy clothes and jewellery.
[36:19] These are envelopes for
the money we collected.
[36:30] Count it,
[36:33] like we used to gather
together and count our Eidi,
[36:37] just think that we got promoted.
[36:52] Why did Roshni come, Umar?
