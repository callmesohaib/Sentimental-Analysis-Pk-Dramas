[00:20] Come.
[00:22] Wish you had come early,
[00:23] Maheen left a little 
while back asking about you.
[00:27] I thought I would 
come on theright time and surprise her,
[00:31] but I got the surprise.
[00:32] The wedding was during the night,
how did it get done during the day.
[00:36] didn’t your mother tell you?
[00:40] She did, so I am asking you,
[00:42] also the home feels so sad,
doesn’t look like a wedding home.
[00:49] the home where the girl
goes from it becomes sad,
[00:53] so does the heart.
[00:54] Have all the guests left?
[00:56] Long time back.
[00:58] will you eat something?
[00:59] No, I don’t want to meet anything.
[01:01] Maheen’s grandma,
[01:04] she came so before the wedding,
[01:05] she should have stayed after too.
[01:10] what will she do living here?
[01:13] That is the wedding
home now honestly.
[01:16] I got free from my
responsibility with peace of mind,
[01:19] they had to make
the arrangements.
[01:22] Arrangements for what?
[01:25] Brother took 
2 days to the reception
[01:28] but still, it was sudden for them,
there is an issue.
[01:33] Should I make you tea?
[01:35] no, I won’t like it if you make tea.
[01:37] Yes,
[01:39] Mahi is not here to care for you,
[01:42] but don’t worry,
[01:44] she will visit often.
[01:46] This is the advantage
of marrying in the family.
[01:49] I think Umar won’t be the type
who would put restrictions on his wife.
[01:54] You are Frank with him too.
[01:57] Umar?
[01:59] he is no stranger for you,
[02:01] you can go meet Mahi when you want
not considering it her in laws home,
[02:06] but her uncle’s.
[03:52] Everyone was up,
[03:54] I think they slept early.
[04:00] You come Umar, come.
[04:17] except for Maheen.
[04:22] Najia was saying 
she is crying continuously.
[04:30] Look Umar,
[04:32] the thing these people think,
let them think that.
[04:40] I am not saying
[04:43] it cause I will come across as a liar,
I am saying it because
[04:48] papa and aunt 
will lose their peace,
[04:53] they will consider
themselves as culprits.
[04:56] Brother, I won’t do
anything like that.
[04:59] in all this Maheen has no fault,
[05:04] so please don’t torture her.
[05:09] Coming to a girl’s life in
this way is painful for her.
[05:21] Saying anything to anyone will
do nothing for me, nothing will change.
[05:28] I know this.
[07:43] are you crying?
[08:00] you don’t cry,
that is not possible.
[08:15] Why are you crying?
[08:18] Tears of happiness,
[08:20] that you didn’t get a bald fat man?
[08:26] Or got someone worse,
that is why you are crying?
[08:52] or are you crying for my heart?
[08:57] Your heart?
[08:59] You are the one 
who knows it all,
[09:05] understands it all that
[09:16] I am not sad that
you were forced in my life,
[09:30] I am sad that
[09:35] she was snatched away from me.
[09:59] you are really good Maheen,
[10:02] really pretty, really good.
[10:18] Change at least.
[10:24] What is all this?
[10:28] Please pick it up,
[10:30] who put it here.
[10:34] I am annoyed.
[12:19] Roshni, open the door.
[12:23] Leave me alone mama
[12:27] Open the door, Roshni.
[12:46] You destroyed the room,
[12:49] what is this anger for?
[12:53] Get up and fix it.
[12:58] Roshni,
[13:00] how long will I do it?
[13:04] Look, my life is a mess already.
[13:06] Leave everything as is,
I didn’t ask you to fix it
[13:14] What are you upset on?
[13:18] You dressed up and went to
congratulate then on Mahi's wedding,
[13:21] since you came from there you got
upset and locked the room.
[13:24] Leave me alone mama.
[13:28] Roshni,
[13:30] what is this attitude?
[13:33] It wont work in life.
[13:36] You forcefully went to Shahista's home
and came back running.
[13:42] Mama, stop.
[13:47] Go from my room, 
leave me alone.
[13:52] Go.
[14:02] Roshni,
[14:05] this is madness and..
[14:07] and ...
[14:11] no one marries a mad person.
[14:26] Yess,
[14:28] No one marries a mad girl,
I am mad.
[14:34] She was smart,
[14:37] she took advantage
of the moment
[14:41] and the world is not
for a simple girl like me.
[14:51] The world is for
opportunists like Maheen.
[14:57] Wow.
[17:24] Umar.
[17:34] Umar.
[17:38] Umar.
[17:43] They are calling us downstairs,
[17:46] I am going.
[18:39] Umar I…
[18:41] anyway.
[18:47] Mansoor.
[18:48] Yeah.
[18:49] Papa said we will all
have breakfast together.
[18:52] One minute. One minute.
Where are you going?
[18:55] I am going down for breakfast,
[18:57] you get ready and come.
I will also check on the newly married couple.
[19:00] Najia, one minute, come here.
[19:03] Najia, no need to joke like this.
[19:07] What is wrong Mansoor, I am their sister in law
[19:09] and Umar should also know that
how big of a hand I have in his marriage.
[19:14] Don’t you dare say
this to them and anyone.
[19:20] Mansoor?
[19:22] look Najia, it’s enough.
[19:25] Listening to your baseless guesses
Umar has faced a big loss.
[19:28] Now don’t add salt to his wounds.
[19:31] What loss? What wounds?
[19:34] I have told you,
I requested you, follow it.
[19:39] The wedding was not done
in normal circumstances,
[19:42] it will take them time to get normal,
[19:45] you saying this can
make them uncomfortable.
[19:50] I get it,
[19:53] mama must have said this.
[19:55] She doesn’t want
sister in laws to be friends,
[19:59] cause she never became friends.
[20:01] If this happens,
who will follow her orders.
[20:04] fine, think what you want.
[20:07] I don’t like getting
involved for no reason.
[20:10] Go have breakfast
I am not going
[20:12] Let me take my mobile.
[20:13] fine, go. I wont go to
their daughter in law.
[20:19] Fareed,
[20:20] this Razia's silence is scaring me,
[20:23] she will surely create a scene.
[20:28] Mama, you always mistake Razia.
[20:32] If she had to create a scene she
would have done it at the wedding.
[20:35] You don’t get her
nature for so long,
[20:38] she is soft on the inside.
She is tough…
[20:40] You and Mansoor,
[20:44] you need a chance to
praise your wife, you start.
[20:49] Hello grandma, hello papa.
[20:51] Hello. Live long.
[20:53] how is my daughter? Fine?
Where is that idiot?
[20:56] Sleeping
[20:58] Okay.
[21:03] where is aunt?
[21:04] She must be busy with work.
[21:06] She had a new daughter in law,
[21:09] she should have come to you,
but no, she is busy with her work.
[21:21] hey, you are still sleeping?
[21:25] Zakia called us.
[21:30] Come on get ready.
[21:34] What happened now?
[21:36] What is the good news?
[21:40] We have to take Maheen's breakfast.
[21:43] You know she doesn’t have a sister,
[21:46] she wanted to take you along.
[21:50] But you are lying here.
[21:53] Come on, 
they must be getting late.
[21:55] Get ready.
[21:56] I don’t want to go.
[22:06] Why do you argue?
[22:08] Look, when you go,
[22:10] you will feel better and
you will get to meet her too.
[22:14] I don’t want to meet Maheen.
[22:17] Say I have a headache.
[22:22] Oh God, your tantrums don’t end.
[22:27] Clean your room cause I wont.
[22:56] I will go see your aunt, 
go sit.
[23:00] Come child, come. Sit here with me.
[23:06] I am your grandma not mother in law,
[23:12] but Razia is now your 
mother in law and not aunt.
[23:16] So be careful,
[23:18] she is mad. Ask me, 
I have been seeing her for 32 years
[23:23] or ask Najia who gets insulted 
by her every second day.
[23:26] You need to be careful.
[23:31] How grandma?
[23:33] You said that Umar is sleeping.
[23:36] Is this how you say it?
[23:38] I swear to God he is sleeping
[23:41] oh no, idiot,
[23:44] he is your husband now,
[23:47] not your cousin,
[23:49] you cannot say he is sleeping. 
Say my dear is sleeping. Say that.
[24:00] Yes grandma.
[24:01] Razia doesn’t like this about Najia,
[24:04] she calls him just like that.
[24:07] He got her himself so 
he is responsible but I got you here,
[24:13] if something happens, 
she will blame me, right?
[24:20] Yes grandma.
[24:22] Hey, must be your mother
[24:24] Really?
[24:24] Yeah, Farid said she 
was 5 minutes away,
[24:27] she was getting breakfast with Monis. 
Go now, get dressed.
[24:32] Why grandma, its just mama?
[24:34] Oh no, you just got married,
[24:38] what will your mother think, 
go dress up, do makeup.
[24:47] Okay, will lipstick do?
[24:49] Okay, go. Go now.
[24:53] I am here Umar,
[24:55] I cannot bother you more.
[25:12] umar,
[25:16] aunt and grandma are calling.
[25:21] I am coming in a bit.
[25:26] Everyone is waiting over breakfast.
[25:30] I am not hungry, I wont eat.
[25:35] Mama got breakfast, 
brother Monis is here too
[25:43] I will come in a bit.
[26:54] Grandma asked me.
[27:08] Smile.
[27:09] grandma, one more.
[27:12] Smile.
[27:15] Yess,
[27:16] Mansor look it,
[27:23] It’s good that there was no recording
[27:25] or we would have known that Umar were 
a borrowed suit to his wedding.
[27:30] stop it. Idiot.
[27:35] Zakia, your brother has organized 
the reception after 2 days.
[27:39] 2 days later. May God bless them.
[27:43] I was thinking of taking Mahi 
with me after the reception,
[27:48] for the custom.
[27:50] Actually I didn’t live without her,
[27:52] so I got sad and couldn’t 
sleep last night.
[27:57] Zakia, these are useless customs, 
reception is in religion,
[28:01] we will invite everyone we need 2 days.
[28:06] You take her today if you want.
[28:11] Really?
[28:12] Yes.
[28:13] If customs get old 
should we quit them?
[28:17] Everything on it’s 
time seems right.
[28:24] Yes, sister in law is right.
[28:36] After all, my in laws are coming 
to meet the daughter in law,
[28:39] they complain..
[28:41] Yes, I will take her after reception.
[28:46] I just said that I take 
her with me, I am sad.
[28:50] Hello.
[28:50] Hello, live long. 
How are you?
[28:53] Don’t worry, I will take 
Maheen to you in the evening.
[28:58] No, sister in law is right, 
come after the reception,
[29:02] we should follow customs.
[29:08] You are saying to me aunt?
[29:11] No, I can’t do that, it’s your home
[29:16] Let’s eat.
[29:18] Hello
[29:24] Come on. Come.
[30:12] Umar.
[30:14] Umar.
[30:17] Your aunt is here, 
she is waiting.
[30:25] They are here to meet you,
[30:27] you go. I will stay..
[30:31] I will sleep for a while.
[30:38] Sleep?
[30:40] Don’t you have to go?
[30:43] Mama must be 
waiting you told her.
[30:50] Yes, I did but
[30:55] I am thinking,
[31:01] what if I face Roshni 
when I go there.
[31:10] It’s a weird thing,
[31:12] I used to go running there,
[31:18] Roshni use to attract me,
[31:23] but even thinking 
about it worries me,
[31:28] if she…
[31:37] sorry Mahi.
[31:49] Forgive me. Sorry.
[31:53] Sorry for what?
[31:57] I told you what was in my heart.
[32:00] I am used to telling you everything, 
you are my best friend.
[32:08] I forgot we have another 
relation apart from friendship,
[32:12] you might mind it.
[32:16] No, I didn’t mind.
[32:23] Honestly? You didn’t mind?
[32:26] I can say what is in my 
heart to you like always?
[32:36] Come sit, sit here.
[32:39] Look Mahi,
[32:41] my heart has a burden,
[32:45] being unfaithful to Roshni
[32:50] I don’t want to hurt you either.
[32:57] You just say once that
[33:00] you will forgive anything I say.
[33:05] I promise I won’t hurt you,
[33:09] but what can I do?
[33:14] I am helpless at the hands of my heart.
[33:17] Umar,
[33:19] you still love Roshni?
[33:30] whatever happened,
[33:35] I can make sure I don’t meet Roshni,
[33:39] keep no relation with her, 
separate from her,
[33:44] but man,
[33:48] what do I do with my heart?
[33:52] How do I separate my heart from her.
[33:55] I was worried for my daughter.
[33:57] Our Maheen is good,
[34:00] so God gave her a good fate.
[34:04] he really likes Mahi.
[34:07] Razia send me to sending her 
Umar couldn’t see her sad,
[34:12] he said he would bring her.
[34:14] tell Roshni to come meet her friend.
[34:17] Yes, she will surely come.
[34:19] He doesn’t consider me his mother in law,
[34:22] he thinks of me as his mother.
[34:24] This proves how much he loves Mahi.
[34:26] God protect them from the evil eye
[34:28] Ameen.
[34:29] have tea, it’s getting cold
[35:07] You two are imbeciles,
[35:11] Maheen my friend,
[35:14] you saw the coast is clear,
[35:17] you got on to him.
[35:21] And poor Umar,
[35:23] I thought he would commit suicide.
[35:28] But he was just waiting that
[35:31] I step back and he takes the step.
[36:00] Maheen, you are a great girl,
[36:06] I know as much as I know myself.
[36:10] I know you didn’t come between me 
and Roshni on purpose.
[36:15] You have no fault,
[36:17] you were as helpless as me. 
In fact more.
[36:24] I have no complaints from you,
[36:27] but what do I do of 
Roshni’s complaints,
[36:35] her sadness, her tears,
[36:41] they will increase the burden on me.
[36:45] The thing is aunt 
Shahista selected me for Nabeel,
[36:49] that is why they are calling me
[36:52] so that I can see how they live.
[36:57] Umar.
[37:02] Umar.
[37:04] Umar, I think you 
should meet Roshni.
[37:12] I should?
[37:15] yes.
[37:19] Maybe the burden on your heart 
will reduce and not increase.
[37:29] I should have told you earlier,
[37:33] but it’s best 
Roshni tells you herself.
[37:39] You go meet her.
