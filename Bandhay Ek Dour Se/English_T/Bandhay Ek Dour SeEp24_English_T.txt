[00:21] I am accepting from my heart,
that I was wrong.
[00:26] If kids marry out of their will, its better.
[00:30] Now, why this sudden confession?
[00:34] Look, I always got upset with Mansoor
that he got the wife he liked,
[00:41] now see no matter how Najia is with us,
[00:44] she is fine with Mansoor
[00:47] and parents want that their children are happy.
[00:51] She cares for Mansoor,
takes care of him, loves him,
[00:55] so much so that
she agreed on his second wedding.
[00:59] Okay, your wish has been fulfilled.
[01:02] Oh God, why would I want that?
[01:05] I just gave an example that
[01:07] she really loves Mansoor and Mansoor
won’t get a second wife with her being there.
[01:21] Get me married again, I am ready.
[01:27] Wow, hear him.
[01:29] We have lost our sleep
in his worry and he is joking.
[01:34] You cannot handle one and you will get another?
[01:37] I am not joking papa,
[01:39] you people were just talking that if parents take
the decision of their children’s wedding its not that good,
[01:45] but if children do it themselves its better.
[01:47] I am saying the same, give me a chance.
[01:50] You and your chances.
[01:52] Everything is not supposed to be taken as a joke.
[01:55] Should I take your dreams of a second wedding.
[01:57] Mama, what is wrong with you?
[02:01] You leave all this and tell me,
when is Maheen coming.
[02:07] How would I know when is she coming.
[02:11] You people go and bring her,
forcefully, and heating her.
[02:14] You have been blamed anyway,
[02:17] now show a demonstration of the same.
[02:21] I don’t care if she comes back or not.
[03:38] Hey,
[03:39] what is this discussion about a second wedding?
[03:42] Let him come again,
[03:44] I will beat him up so much,
[03:46] that he will remember the beating
he got in his childhood.
[03:49] He was joking mama.
[03:52] To hell with his jokes.
[03:54] We are a joke in the community
and he is fooling around.
[04:00] Come here.
[04:01] Come here.
[04:04] What is it grandma?
[04:05] Tell me,
[04:08] Why did you mention of a second
wedding in front of your parents?
[04:16] I am going. Bye.
[04:18] Sit, I will get breakfast.
[04:19] No, I don’t want it, thank you.
[04:21] Yes, the second wife must be waiting,
she will make him bread, he will eat it.
[04:28] Hear this,
[04:29] the taunts in this home never ends.
[04:32] Look at this,
[04:34] the wife has bothered him and
he is getting upset with his parents.
[04:37] What have we said?
[04:38] She didn’t fight with us and leave.
[04:43] Look Razia,
[04:45] Maheen is not a bad girl.
[04:48] Its her mother,
[04:50] she likes fighting
[04:53] and till Maheen is there,
she will make her go insane.
[04:58] But don’t worry,
[05:00] I will go there myself and
make Maheen understand
[05:04] and I will also fix the mind of that conspirator.
[05:08] Leave it mama,
[05:09] Fareed has told us not to.
[05:11] He said he will go today or tomorrow.
[05:13] Oh no, if he goes,
[05:16] he will beg them and
agree to God knows what.
[05:21] You go with him
[05:23] or else God knows what that
conspirator will make him agree to.
[05:27] Mama, you are right.
[05:28] Yeah.
[05:33] Fine.
[05:45] No one takes me seriously.
[05:49] I said something and everyone was after me.
[05:52] What was the need for you to talk about
a second marriage from now on.
[05:58] When would I do it, Roshni?
[06:00] Earlier you said that I should do it sooner its getting late
and now you are saying something else.
[06:03] If you talk about the second marriage right now,
[06:05] then everyone will react.
[06:06] She has fought and left home upset,
[06:09] everyone will think that you talked
to Maheen about the second marriage
[06:13] and that is why she left.
[06:15] Brother and sister in law feel that way.
[06:17] Yes,
[06:18] then talk about this
when everything gets clear.
[06:23] How will it get clear?
[06:25] When the final decision is made.
[06:29] When the divorce is done, then.
[06:40] Divorce?
[06:42] Yes, divorce.
[06:43] Look,
[06:44] till the time she is in your life,
[06:47] everyone will react this way.
[06:49] Once she leaves from your life,
[06:54] what can anyone do?
[06:58] What happened?
[07:01] Nothing.
[07:14] I am really happy,
[07:16] that very soon the two of us will be one.
[07:38] Maheen, move out of the way,
don’t disturb me.
[07:41] See.
[07:43] Oh, out!
[07:45] I am bored.
[07:48] If you are bored,
sit with me and watch the match.
[07:50] You know I don’t like cricket.
[07:54] Yeah, yeah of course.
[07:57] You like games like cards, ludo,
the games you can play sitting.
[08:01] Game for lazy girls.
[08:03] I don’t play them now.
There is no one to play with me here.
[08:09] Okay, lets do one thing.
[08:11] Come on, I will play with you.
[08:14] Really?
[08:15] And your match?
[08:18] Hey, it will be re-telecasted,
I will watch it again.
[08:20] Come, lets play.
[08:22] You know I will beat you so badly,
that you will take the name of ludo again.
[08:25] No, no one can defeat me in ludo.
[08:28] You will regret.
[08:29] You are the one who will regret,
[08:31] that I wish I had not played this game.
[08:33] Come on.
[08:43] You win this game Umar,
[08:46] I give you permission.
[09:34] Its not dead.
[09:35] Its still not dead.
[09:38] See it.
[09:39] Umar, you see it?
[09:43] I see it, I see it well.
[09:46] I play so well.
[09:48] Really good.
[09:50] Why isn’t it going right? 
Why isn’t it going right?
[09:57] Look, look. See here…
[09:58] Do you even have a little shame?
[10:01] I have been trying like mad
for the past 15 minutes.
[10:04] Who is asking you to try?
[10:05] You are ill mannered.
[10:06] Okay leave it, it will get destroyed.
[10:08] Leave it Maheen. Leave it.
[10:10] Ill mannered. Fraud.
[10:12] You are calling your husband,
[10:13] your allegoric God,
[10:14] ill mannered and a fraud
and you are hitting him too.
[10:16] Don’t you dare.
[10:17] Who is my allegoric God?
[10:18] Yes, me.
[10:19] You are my allegoric God?
[10:19] Yes, me.
[10:21] Allegoric God.
[10:22] You were committing such a big sin.
[10:23] Allegoric God.
[10:24] Allegoric God.
I will just now tell grandma.
[10:24] No, okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[11:19] I want to talk to you Maheen.
[11:23] Brother, I have to give tea to mama.
[11:24] Look, I don’t want to talk in front of mama.
[11:27] And if there is something
that you don’t want to tell her
[11:30] because she will get hurt,
[11:31] then at least tell me.
[11:42] I have made her sad,
even when I didn’t wanted to.
[11:46] Not just her,
you are sad yourself too, Maheen.
[11:49] On one hand you don’t want to go back,
[11:51] you don’t want to live with Umar
[11:53] and on the other hand,
all your night is spent crying.
[11:57] The decision that is hurting you so much,
I want to know the reason behind it.
[12:05] Brother, don’t ask me so many questions,
[12:08] I have told you what was there.
[12:09] You have not told me anything
[12:10] and what we have found from another source,
you are denying it.
[12:13] If there is nothing like that then tell us,
aunt and uncle are coming, what do we say to them?
[12:20] Uncle?
[12:21] Yes,
[12:23] he called, he is on his way.
[12:25] That is why I want to talk to you,
that tell me what it is.
[12:29] Look if you don’t want to go back,
or it is not possible for you to live there,
[12:33] I should have something to say.
[12:35] This isn’t enough that I say to them
that you don’t want to go there.
[12:44] Maheen.
[12:51] I have to give tea to mama.
[13:34] Yes, go ahead Maheen, what is it now?
[13:39] Why are you crying?
[13:41] Stop crying and tell me what happened?
[13:46] Oh,
[13:50] mama and papa.
[13:53] That is why I am thinking
why papa didn’t come along.
[13:59] So then say it to them,
[14:01] tell them what you told me.
[14:03] Tell them that you don’t want to live with me.
[14:06] You have already told me, 
now you cannot say it in front of them?
[14:48] Maheen, open the door.
[14:49] What is this childish behaviour.
[14:51] Maheen, open the door I say.
[14:52] Aunt, what is this noise about?
[14:56] What do I tell you, she is driving me mad,
a new drama everyday.
[15:00] Now, tell me,
[15:01] you said that she is not treated well at the in-laws
and even Umar is not fine with her, right?
[15:07] Yes, but what happened?
[15:09] I talked to them about this there,
she got upset.
[15:11] Now her uncle and aunt are coming to talk,
[15:13] she has locked the room and
sitting inside saying she won’t meet them.
[15:16] If she doesn’t meet them,
then how will we make truce?
[15:19] They are coming for truce?
[15:20] Obviously, that is what elders are for that
if something wrong happens in the home,
[15:23] there is some issue,
then they sit and solve the issue,
[15:26] what else are they there for?
[15:27] But see if she doesn’t meet,
then how will things progress.
[15:30] You don’t worry, I will talk to her.
[15:32] You don’t worry, you go.
[15:33] Yes, talk to her, she listens to you.
[15:42] Maheen, open the door.
[15:45] Maheen.
[16:03] What happened?
[16:04] Why are you not opening the door,
is everything ok?
[16:13] Mama.
[16:16] Mama.
[16:19] Oh, lower your voice,
[16:20] grandma is sleeping, she has a headache.
[16:22] You tell me, where is mama and papa?
[16:26] I don’t know I just came from work,
[16:28] I gave grandma tea and medicine,
now I am going up.
[16:31] Did you not ask grandma where they are?
[16:33] No, I didn’t ask her.
[16:35] You will say this and I will believe you.
[16:37] You know well where they went,
[16:39] to Maheen’s home,
[16:40] to convince her, to aunt.
[16:42] Hey, I really don’t know and even if they have gone,
what issue do you have?
[16:46] What issue will I have?
[16:47] I am only thinking why they are hiding this from me,
what is the secrecy in this.
[16:51] Its possible they felt
that you wont let them go
[16:54] and you don’t want that
Maheen comes back to this home.
[16:56] I don’t want it?
[16:57] What is wrong with you sister in law?
[16:59] How do I make you people believe that
she doesn’t want to come back here.
[17:01] Not once, she has said this a thousand time
that she doesn’t want to come here.
[17:05] Okay fine,
[17:06] she has said no a thousand times,
[17:07] then she will say the same
thing in front of mama and papa,
[17:10] what are you worried about?
[17:11] I am worried as to why mama and
papa are interested in hearing Maheen say no.
[17:16] What was the need for them to go there?
[17:18] When Maheen said this to me clearly
that she wants a divorce
[17:21] and now when she will say
this in front of mama and papa,
[17:23] then they will be hurt.
[17:27] Were you hurt too?
[17:31] Speak up.
[17:33] Answer me.
[17:37] Were you hurt,
[17:38] is that the reason you are upset?
[17:45] Why would I get hurt?
[17:53] What have you done to yourself?
[18:00] I feel sorry for you.
[18:03] When Umar sees you his heart will soften.
[18:08] That poor thing shows sympathy to anyone.
[18:15] Sympathy,
[18:17] feeling sorry?
[18:21] What have I done to myself?
[18:25] I have taken this decision to fix my condition,
[18:28] because I don’t want anyone to feel sorry
or show sympathy to me.
[18:34] I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
[18:37] I know this, not those people.
[18:40] They just want that you and Umar…
[18:45] unless they don’t find a valid reason,
[18:47] they will try to ensure that
there is peace between you two.
[18:54] That is why you told them that false reasoning.
[18:58] Me?
[19:06] You know why I am not stepping out of the room,
[19:08] why I am hiding inside the room?
[19:10] Because I wont be able to face uncle and aunty.
[19:13] Roshni, what was the need to say
that they treat me badly,
[19:17] and now Umar also thinks
the same about me that I said this and
[19:22] I cannot say anything because of you,
[19:24] because he will think that
I am creating a misunderstanding in his heart for you,
[19:27] because he is already thinking like this.
[19:29] One second, I understood you.
[19:44] I will tell him
[19:48] that I said all of this
[19:54] and I said it for the betterment of you two,
[19:58] I didn’t have any bad intentions.
[20:00] That poor man is scared
[20:03] that in this separation you 
might take his and my name.
[20:06] He will be in trouble.
[20:12] He tried his best to keep you happy
[20:16] and so did I,
[20:17] just for our friendship, for our sake.
[20:21] I decided to leave Umar’s life.
[20:25] Nobody needs to do anything for my sake.
[20:30] I don’t want to take further favors from you two
[20:34] and whatever Umar did for me,
[20:39] I will pay back Umar’s favors as well.
[20:41] I will not let the name of you
two come in this whole story.
[20:50] But Maheen,
[20:52] all this will happen
when you talk to them straight forwardly.00:20:55.02]
[20:55] You tell them your decision.
[21:00] Look Maheen,
[21:01] you will have to choose one side,
[21:04] make your life easy and
also make Umar’s life easy.
[21:07] He is only suffering because of you.
[21:32] Umar,
[21:34] you didn’t answer my question.
[21:36] Did you feel hurt?
[21:38] When she asked for a divorce,
[21:41] did you not feel any pain?
[21:43] Why would I feel pain, sister in law,
[21:45] when she is happy?
[21:47] She should have been hurt.
[21:49] If she is happy, then so am I.
[21:52] Okay,
[21:55] then why is your tone 
so broken while talking about this.
[22:00] Why is there so much disappointment,
[22:02] so much loneliness on your face,
[22:04] that you get from the fear of losing someone.
[22:08] Sister in law, there is no loneliness on my face,
[22:12] you have started your speculations again, all wrong.
[22:16] I am going from here.
[22:17] Umar,
[22:19] at least answer me.
[22:23] Does the empty room not bother you,
[22:26] all your night is spent walking on the roof,
[22:31] how long will you hide?
[22:34] And from whom will you hide it from?
[22:36] Will you hide it from yourself too?
[22:59] Monis.
[23:01] Yes?
[23:01] Monis, find out,
[23:02] where are your uncle and aunt,
 they left a long time back,
[23:05] have they changed their 
mind about coming here.
[23:06] Its good that they don’t come,
[23:08] after all, she is sitting upset
[23:09] and when we cannot talk about anything, 
what result will we get?
[23:13] No, no, she is getting better, 
she came out of the room,
[23:17] she is ready to talk to her uncle and aunt.
[23:19] I think Roshni made her understand.
[23:23] Roshni.
[23:25] Mama, did Roshni tell you the complains
 Maheen has with Umar and her in-laws?
[23:30] No, not me, she told her mother.
[23:32] She mentioned it to me so I found out,
[23:34] or else Maheen is so cunning
 she kept it inside her heart.
[23:38] and Maheen said all this to Roshni.
[23:42] Obviously,
[23:44] she shared her sorrow with her friend,
[23:46] she didn’t tell her mother anything.
[23:50] Anyway, you find out, where are those people.
[24:00] Does the empty room not bother you,
[24:03] all your night is spent walking on the roof,
[24:07] how long will you hide?
[24:09] And from whom will you hide it from?
[24:11] Will you hide it from yourself too?
[24:25] I am not hiding anything from anyone,
[24:28] I have no pain, it doesn’t matter to me
 whether she is in my life or not.
[24:40] Speak up brother Mansoor,
[24:42] you too say what sister in law is saying is correct.
[24:44] You two…
[24:49] What?
[24:51] What are you saying brother Mansoor?
[24:54] How?
[24:56] Where are mama and papa?
[25:01] I am coming.
[25:05] Oh my God, God help.
[25:24] No uncle,
[25:28] I won’t go back.
[25:33] I not only respect you, I really love you also,
[25:37] but this wish of yours, I cannot fulfill it.
[25:45] You please,
[25:48] don’t consider this my stubbornness,
[25:51] consider it my helplessness
[25:55] and
[25:57] just think that living with Umar is no less 
than a punishment for me.
[26:04] If you help me,
[26:07] then both families will be saved from destruction.
[26:11] But please, don’t force me.
[26:18] I know that…
[26:22] I know you are really hurt to hear this,
[26:28] but please,
[26:31] you also try and understand I had to put 
a stone on my heart and say this to you.
[26:52] Are they here?
[26:55] Stay with me.
[26:57] Come on.
[26:59] Uncle and aunt had an accident.
[27:04] Umar called.
[27:08] What?
[27:13] The ankle is displaced,
[27:15] thank God its not a fracture,
[27:17] God have mercy,
[27:19] the doctor has recommended bed rest for some time.
[27:21] And papa,
[27:22] his operation is going on for so long,
 is everything ok?
[27:26] He has serious injuries,
[27:28] I hope God is kind.
[27:33] You shouldn’t have got grandma here, 
she is crying so much.
[27:38] What are you saying Mansoor,
[27:39] she was crying so much at home, 
we are all here we will console her.
[27:45] I pray to God before mama regains consciousness, 
papa’s operation is completed,
[27:52] we give her a good news.
[27:54] Everything will be fine. 
Did anyone inform aunt and Maheen.
[27:58] Yes I did.
[28:01] Oh God.
[28:06] Brother, sister in law, what happened?
[28:08] Umar.
[28:09] Where are mama and papa?
[28:10] Umar. Umar, pray.
 Papa is in the operation theatre.
[28:14] is everything ok? Mama. Where is mama?
[28:16] Be strong. 
We are shifting mama to the room.
[28:18] Be strong.
[28:18] Tell me honestly.
[28:19] I am telling you honestly.
[28:20] Everything is fine Umar. 
You pray. Everything is fine.
[28:22] You just pray.
[28:24] Be strong and pray, by the will of God it will all be fine.
[28:29] Umar,
[28:32] just pray, ok?
[28:34] Yes, it’s a black gate. Yes, this is it. 
We are coming. Hurry up mama.
[28:39] Hey, oh God, I am getting so tensed.
[28:42] I don’t know what to do in tension.
[28:44] I am dropping things, God have mercy.
[28:47] God have mercy.
[28:48] Maheen, lock the door.
[28:50] One minute. One minute.
[28:51] Brother wait a minute, 
I will get my shawl I am also coming.
[28:54] No but…
[28:55] Okay fine, hurry up. We are already late.
[28:58] I was just saying that after she left home, 
the whole family must know.
[29:03] Now everyone will come to meet them, 
they will say things to her.
[29:08] So what mama?
[29:09] I cannot stop myself out of the fear of people talking 
and leave uncle and aunt like this.
[29:13] Come on mama, 
nothing will happen. Lets go.
[29:15] Okay.
[29:17] Lock the door.
[29:23] Come quickly.
[29:27] What happened? All ok?
[29:30] Nothing is ok.
[29:31] Maheen’s in-laws were coming to our home,
[29:34] they had an accident on the way, 
they are in the hospital.
[29:36] God have mercy.
[29:37] Yes, you just pray.
[29:38] Hurry up mama.
[29:40] and take care of the home.
[29:41] Yes. Yes.
[29:42] Aunt pray. Come on, man.
[29:50] God have mercy.
[30:04] Oh God, mama, how are they?
[30:07] Why have you come now Zakia? 
To see the show?
[30:11] Why would I come to see the show mama? 
What are you saying?
[30:14] Brother Fareed is my brother,
[30:15] he is the shade on the heads of my orphan children, 
may this shadow always stay on our head.
[30:21] yes, that is why you called him to beg you,
[30:24] and he too was coming to beg you, 
to request your children.
[30:29] Grandma, stop it, it’s a hospital.
[30:31] You sit. Sit down.
[30:33] Tell her to leave from here.
[30:34] You sit.
[30:34] Go from here, 
let me pray peacefully for my children.
[30:39] You sit.
[30:40] Get lost.
[30:42] Grandma he is equally dear to us as he is to you.
[30:45] Uncle is our support too,
[30:47] that is why we are praying for him too.
[30:50] Umar, what did the doctor say?
[30:54] We will find out after the operation,
[30:57] all of you please pray.
[31:08] Okay my son, be quiet.
[31:32] I am coming.
[31:41] Hello.
[31:43] Hello.
[31:46] Are you coming from aunt Zakia’s home?
[31:48] Yes.
[31:49] What did you talk about? 
did you find out something?
[31:52] No, there is no news, because those 
people have not returned from the hospital.
[31:56] But you should have at least called them.
[32:00] I am calling Umar, 
he is not picking up my phone.
[32:03] Why are you calling Umar, call Maheen.
[32:09] I called Maheen, but her phone was off
[32:12] and Umar’s parents had an accident,
[32:15] I will call him.
[32:16] God have mercy,
[32:19] may God keep the shade of the elders always.
[32:22] But because of this accident Maheen went back,
[32:28] maybe their condition will get better now.
[32:34] What happened?
[32:39] What did she got upset?
[33:04] Umar.
[33:05] Umar.
[33:06] What happened?
[33:06] Papa’s operation is successful, 
he is out of danger.
[33:09] Thank God.
[33:14] Why are you people lying?
[33:16] Tell me honestly, how is he now?
[33:18] Aunt.
[33:19] He is fine.
[33:20] He is fine, trust me.
[33:22] The doctor said he will be fine, 
our prayers worked.
[33:26] Oh God, thank you so much.
[33:33] But I,
[33:35] I have become a handicapped 
and will be bed ridden.
[33:40] Hey mama, 
why are you thinking like this?
[33:43] Death is better than such a life of handicap.
[33:47] Why are you saying these damned things, Razia.
[33:51] Don’t give me fake hope.
[33:54] Its better that
[33:56] God calls me to him instead of living on 
someone’s support for the rest of my life.
[34:02] Aunt, the doctor said you will be fine, 
you just need to rest.
[34:08] Don’t give me fake hope.
[34:12] Okay, I will do one thing, 
I will call the doctor,
[34:14] he will tell you himself that 
nothing happened to you, everything is fine.
[34:18] The doctor will say whatever you told him.
[34:22] I know I am not fine.
[34:25] Okay fine, go, call the doctor.
[34:32] Sister in law, what happened?
[34:35] Are you ok?
[34:36] I don’t know I just felt dizzy.
[34:38] Sit.
[34:39] Sit.
[34:46] I am fine, I will go and call the doctor.
[34:56] Umar,
[34:58] man, don’t worry, 
uncle will regain consciousness,
[35:03] ok?
[35:04] I will go and drop Maheen and mama home, 
then I will come back to you.
[35:09] No, you don’t need to come back, its ok.
[35:18] What happened sister in law? 
Are you ok?
[35:20] What happened?
[35:21] Nothing, I just took her to the doctor,
[35:24] her BP is a little low, 
she has not eaten anything since morning.
[35:28] I am fine.
[35:29] You take sister in law home,
[35:32] you go home and rest sister in law, 
Grandma is alone at home too.
[35:35] No, who will stay with mama?
[35:39] I am here.
[35:41] No, its important for you to stay with papa.
[35:45] Najia, Umar is right, we cannot leave 
grandma alone at home,
[35:51] you should stay at home with her,
[35:53] this way you will get to rest a little too.
[35:56] No,
[35:59] mama is really worried,
[36:01] and I don’t know why she feels 
we are hiding something from her.
[36:05] I cannot leave her alone like this,
[36:06] someone has to stay 
with her in this condition.
[36:10] I will stay.
[36:16] I will stay with aunt, 
you go home and rest sister in law.
[36:52] Papa.
[36:57] Papa.
[37:01] Please open your eyes,
[37:03] talk to me.
[37:14] Forgive me papa.
[37:20] Forgive me.
[37:21] I have really bothered you.
[37:28] I will not do it again.
[37:33] I promise you, 
I will accept anything you say,
[37:36] I will not go against 
any decision you take for me.
[37:42] Please forgive me.
[37:46] Just open your eyes,
[37:49] papa, I am dying to hear your voice.
[37:52] Forgive me.
[37:55] Forgive me.
[38:07] Umar.
