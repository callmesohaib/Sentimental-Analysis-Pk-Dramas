[00:21] Where are you?
What are you doing sitting here?
[00:24] Give him this.
[00:27] One minute, look at this.
[00:34] My  beloved Roshni.
[00:37] Yes,
[00:37] I will still call you beloved,
[00:40] you are upset, still.
[00:46] Umar.
[00:53] Umar, I have some work, come please.
[01:07] Go ahead.
[01:11] Sorry.
[01:14] Sorry, man.
[01:16] Okay, I shouldn’t have
doubted Roshni like this,
[01:20] should I hold my ears?
[01:22] What are you doing?
[01:24] Put your hands down,
[01:26] what will people think?
Talk to the groom, go.
[01:30] Okay, forgive me.
[01:36] I am not upset with you,
[01:40] I can never be upset with you,
[01:43] you are my best friend
[01:46] and the secret keeper of my love.
[01:53] I hope my love survives.
[01:58] Don’t worry.
[02:04] Hey, fix that.
[02:06] These people ignore things a lot.
[02:30] I was waiting for so long,
I am bored sitting at home,
[02:34] don’t know where aunty is.
[02:36] You too have come right now.
[02:39] Are you not tired since morning?
[02:41] No, I don’t get tired,
[02:43] aunt Shahista gave me the responsibility
for handling two rooms.
[02:47] Actually uncle is coming,
[02:49] and he is really fussy about things,
[02:51] so mama is conscious.
[02:53] She wants everything to be perfect.
[02:55] Aunt never thought of me like that,
[02:58] I am also a guest,
[02:59] God knows where aunt is and you came at 12.
[03:03] Okay,
[03:05] you consider us your guests?
[03:08] You are our own,
[03:11] specially mama thinks you are our own.
[03:15] I didn’t know that you
[03:17] will have complaints like strangers.
[03:21] Okay, did you eat?
[03:23] No, I am hungry.
[03:26] Lets order pizza.
[03:27] Chicken Tikka.
[03:30] Yes.
[03:40] I came here with the hope to meet you,
[03:42] the dream to make you mine,
[03:44] the dream will come true soon Roshni,
[03:46] you might have left disappointed,
[03:49] please come back,
[03:51] I am waiting for you.
[03:52] DO you want something else?
[03:56] Nothing.
[03:57] Yes.
[03:59] How do we play this?
[04:03] I am too tired, you figure out yourself.
[04:05] Your pizza is coming, I will go change.
[04:28] Yeah,
[04:29] yeah.
[04:30] Man, Maheen,
[04:31] I had told you earlier to tell him not message me,
I am busy,
[04:37] I don’t want to talk to him.
[04:38] On top of that, he is so cheap, class.
[04:44] You tell him yourself, tell him that
I am happy seeing someone’s money and home,
[04:51] we cannot live together, sorry.
[04:53] Hello,
[04:55] two proposals came for you too,
[04:57] one had a general store and a rental home,
[05:00] the other was an employee at WAPDA,
had his own home and a government home,
[05:04] who did you say yes too? One minute,
one minute Roshni.
[05:09] First thing,
[05:10] I didn’t give anyone hope
or gave them false hope,
[05:13] my mother kept both these
proposals in front of me,
[05:15] and the decision was her too.
[05:19] Man ,don’t be sarcastic.
Tell him not message me,
[05:24] I don’t want to talk to him tell him
to forget me, ok?
[05:28] or I will treat him bad.
[05:31] What worse can you do Roshni?
Because of you,
[05:36] he won’t be able to leave the wedding,
[05:38] nor will he be able to fake a
smile in front of people.
[05:41] His heart will be broken,
he won’t be able to do anything.
[05:44] I am putting down the phone. Bye.
[05:47] Hello. Hello.
[06:02] Oh well. Oh God, the swimming pool.
[06:18] Shahista, you now have a pretty home,

[06:28] Hello
[06:30] Sister in law Shahista, you are really lucky.
[06:33] Where did you get this maid from?
[06:40] You like her that much?

[09:26] Please,
[09:27] Roshni, try and understanding.
[09:29] It was a misunderstanding?
[09:32] Misunderstanding?
[09:34] If it was a misunderstanding
[09:36] then why didn’t your mother clear it out?
[09:39] You too stayed quiet.
[09:42] Am I a servant of this home?
[09:46] this is why I never wanted to shift to Pakistan,
[09:49] I can’t take this family politics.
[09:54] Look Roshni, my mother lives with her in-laws the
same way your mother lives with her in-laws.
[10:00] I just cleared it all.
[10:06] Roshni, I know you didn’t like it,
[10:08] I swear to God, I feel really bad about it
[10:12] but you will have to ignore a few things.
[10:15] If you want to  live in this home,
[10:17] then not just me and mama,
you too will have to ignore a few things,
[10:21] so please ignore a few things.
[10:24] Fine,
[10:26] but only cause you asked me.
[10:31] Please stop crying.
[10:36] Come I will get you coffee, ok?
[10:39] Not coffee, I will have ice cream

[11:10] Naija has the habit of keeping her husband close.
[11:14] Brother Farid.
[11:15] Yeah?
[11:16] the boys family called.
[11:20] Why? All ok?
[11:22] They want us to send the
thing from the dowry
[11:28] Why is that?
[11:29] They are coming to the function in the evening,
[11:31] we will send the things by tomorrow.
[11:33] Its fine, Umar.
[11:36] they are so weird, why the mistrust,
the thing would reach tomorrow.
[11:40] No, they were saying, they will set the things
before the bride comes home.
[11:45] Umar.
[11:49] what happened? All ok?
[11:50] you do one thing, go…
[11:52] Papa, I cannot go anywhere,
we are doing something.
[11:56] What are you doing? For the past 3 days you
have been dancing and singing and nothing else.
[12:00] Mahi’s things need to be delivered at her in laws,
arrange a leader.
[12:05] we need to deliver it today?
[12:07] Are we sending her away too?
[12:10] why would we do it today?
[12:13] Zakia, you can never be sure,
[12:15] like those people became stubborn,
[12:17] that the wedding should be
done on the mendhi,
[12:19] now they are asking for the things,
[12:21] you never know, they might want
to take her after the wedding.
[12:29] what are you saying?
[12:31] Stop it now.
[12:37] Why are standing? Go now.
[12:39] okay, its not been 2 minute…
[12:41] Okay listen, tell Nofil to… they don’t seem

[12:51] my son is tired.
[13:05] Fine,

[13:13] your tea.
[13:15] I spoke to your mother on the phone,
[13:18] I thought she would come, but…
[13:22] But the thing is,
[13:24] mama said that you have gone,
that’s enough.
[13:28] Mana cannot travel so much in old age.
[13:32] Okay, had she come,
[13:35] I would spoken to her myself.
[13:38] regarding?
[13:39] You. If she was here,
[13:41] I would spoken in detail and
she would have seen our home
[13:47] and how happy you are here.
It would have been easier for her to decide.
[13:54] Decide?
[13:56] Anyway, I will talk to her myself.
[13:59] I don’t think she will say no.
[14:03] What do you think?
[14:09] should I get you something else?
[14:11] no, tea is enough
[14:15] Nimco?
[14:16] Err.. Noodles?
[14:18] Macaroni, spaghetti, I can cook it all.
[14:20] yes, that’s good.
[14:23] Right now tea is fine.
[14:24] Okay.
[14:29] Shahista has gone mad,
[14:32] do you talk to a girl like this about relations?
[14:37] You have no shame,
[14:39] you are talking to your mother like this?
[14:42] Mama,
[14:44] the one who is shy is at loss.
You should be happy,
[14:48] instead of that you are scolding me.
[14:50] will be happy the day she brings a proposal.
[14:54] I know she is accustomed to ways abroad
[14:57] and she also has a lot of money
[14:59] but this doesn’t mean we have forgotten our
customs and we are no useless people,
[15:06] tell her when she gets the
proposal I will think about it.
[15:12] Mama, you…
[15:13] Okay, stop it, put down the phone,
[15:15] I need to iron  the clothes and get ready,
[15:17] I have to go to Maheen’s mendhi.
[15:19] Yes, you go get ready. Bye
[15:22] Bye.
[15:26] maheen’s engagement.
[15:30] I feel, Maheen told Umar everything,
[15:32] that is why that idiot isn’t calling.
[15:35] Anyway, I got rid of him.
[15:38] Where is the remote for the TV? Oh.
[15:47] Keep the things. Where is everyone?
[15:51] Where are the sweets?
[15:54] Not here. Give it to me.
Get more if there is more.
[16:03] Hurry up. Umar. Yeah.Umar.
[16:06] what happened?
[16:10] I heard you got fever.
[16:12] Look, you found out that the groom wears a wig,
[16:17] he is 4 ft tall. No problem, for humanity sake,
[16:21] he must be good at heart.
[16:22] Umar, please. Have to talk to you.
[16:24] what Maheen, it’s late now,
[16:28] I have dropped your dowry stuff there,
[16:30] you should have told me earlier.
You had a message, I would have given it.
[16:34] Umar, can you ever be serious in your life?
[16:37] Maheen what is the point of being serious now?
[16:39] What had to happen, happened.
[16:42] What? I had told you not to say
yes looking at the picture only,
[16:47] I also told you, I told you,
[16:50] I will take you to meet him, but you didn’t agree.
Get the sweets man!
[16:56] Everyone is working.
[16:59] Umar, listen to me once. Please..
[17:02] Maheen, a lot of work needs to be done,
you are bothering me.
[17:07] come here.
[17:09] What happened? Listen to me for 2 minutes,
it’s for your own benefit. I am serious.
[17:13] one minute, nothing can be done now.
[17:16] We can only be patient and
be thankful for what we have.
[17:19] Umar..
[17:22] Umar is right, Maheen, forget everything.
[17:28] Umar, take this and go out, you come inside.
[17:31] You have high fever..
I have to talk to Umar. Do it later, come on.
[20:40] the fever isn’t going down aunt.
[20:44] If she eats, I will give her medication.
[20:46] I gave her the medication.
[20:51] Mama, I feel dizzy.
[20:52] Once the wedding gets done, you sleep,
[20:54] I won’t let anyone come in the room.
[20:56] Zakia. Yeah?
[20:58] come outside, your brother is calling.
[21:00] yes, he must be calling for the wedding.
I will come.
[21:03] Yes, he wants to talk about that,
come on. Come. Why?
[21:09] Nothing, your brother will tell you,
come on.
[21:15] what do those people want to talk about now?
[21:17] No, don’t worry, nothing like that.
[21:21] The elders will sort it. You lie down.
[21:27] move. Lie down, put your feet up.
[21:29] Sister, I feel dizzy, check please.
[21:32] I will.
[21:40] Zakia, you remember well?
[21:43] how can I forget?
They never mentioned a car.
[21:48] and how could they do it?
[21:50] Did they not see the home,
[21:53] where did they see cars parked here?
[21:54] Speak slowly. What is wrong?
[21:57] But those people are saying
[22:01] that they spoke of a car being given
and that didn't reach with the dowry.
[22:07] Brother, I dont have the
money to give a car for dowry.
[22:10] Why dont you talk to them?
[22:12] I will, you too come along,
remember the guests are still here so no one should find out.
[22:19] Mama, for God's sake,
[22:21] dont get emotional and promise them a car.
[22:23] where will we get a car in one night.
[22:26] In fact, uncle, leave mama,
let me talk to those people.
[22:29] You dont understand these matters.
[22:30] Uncle,
[22:31] this is wrong,
[22:33] right at the time of the wedding,
[22:34] with a home full of guests,
they cannot blackmail us.
[22:37] You be quiet.
[22:40] Umar come here.
[22:41] Yes papa.
[22:42] You take him to the roof,
he wants to ruin everything.
[22:46] Man, elders are here, they will talk.
[22:49] Take him upstairs, don’t bring him
back till I tell you.
[22:51] Okay.
[22:52] Uncle, you…
[22:54] okay, you people talk.
[22:56] Come on, let them talk.
[22:57] He doesn’t understand the crisis we are in,
you don’t worry,
[23:03] we will find a solution, don’t worry.
[23:39] Look, at time of the proposal,
you knew our condition.
[23:46] My sister in law is a widow and lives quietly.
[23:52] So when she didn’t make any tall claims,
[23:57] then how can you put such
a condition suddenly?
[24:05] Mr. Fareed,
[24:07] you are talking like we have said
something out of this world.
[24:15] Here when giving dowry,
[24:17] people get plots written in their name,
[24:19] we have asked for an ordinary car.
[24:22] We didn’t ask for a Mercedes.
[24:26] No, you can give the car as per your standing,
[24:30] we need to have a good name in the family,
[24:32] that we left all the proposals from the family
and are getting a girl from outside,
[24:36] so the in-laws gave us so much respect,
[24:39] or else…
[24:40] Sister,
[24:41] I still respect you,
[24:44] but how can I agree to something
that is not in my control.
[24:50] Yes, but lets find out,
[24:51] that how did you think of the
car at the time of the wedding.
[24:57] We didn’t know we would have
to say it ourselves,
[24:59] when you sent the dowry we found out,
wood and utensils.
[25:08] The jewelry was not great.
[25:10] I was thinking you saved the money for the jewelry,
you got the car,
[25:15] when I asked, I found out there was no such plan,
not even a cycle.
[25:20] When you have imagined all this yourself,
then there is no fault of ours.
[25:24] I mean, if you had mentioned this earlier,
[25:28] I would have somehow done
something to get it.
[25:31] Stop it, how would you have gotten a car?
[25:34] Right now, the fridge and
AC was gotten with difficulty.
[25:40] hear that, this was the home you
 found to get the wedding done.
[25:44] I told you,
[25:45] check properly.
[25:48] They took loans to get the fridge.
[25:51] How was I to know, they just had one daughter,
[25:56] or else people who have 3-4 daughters have 
made such preparations and have things ready.
[26:02] What sort of a mother is she?
[26:03] She had nothing for her only daughter.
[26:28] what are you people doing?
[26:30] Should I tell your parents? 
Go down.
[26:38] what is wrong Monis,
[26:40] they were just talking. Relax man.
[26:46] I don’t know I am scared man.
[26:49] God knows what we will 
hear from downstairs.
[26:52] Scared of what?
[26:55] Look man,
[26:57] Maheen is a great girl,
[26:59] I have faith nothing wrong will happen,
[27:03] you will see.
[27:05] Papa is there,
[27:08] he will make a good decision. You will see,
[27:12] nothing will happen by the will of God.
[27:17] You will see. sit down.
[27:24] The weather is good.
[27:25] Yes. right?
[27:27] I hope all is good downstairs.
[27:30] It will be, you are thinking again.
[28:49] Najia, come, have food.
[28:51] What happened?
[28:54] Nothing, they are talking.
[28:57] Did the guests leave or are 
they still waiting for the wedding?
[29:02] Yes,
[29:04] the distant ones left,
[29:06] but some are waiting, not for the wedding, 
but to see the scene.
[29:17] Mansoor,
[29:18] leave this food
[29:20] and bring your father out,
[29:22] he doesn’t understand my signs.
[29:24] What happened?
[29:26] He is agreeing to all the boys family says,
[29:30] all that is left for him is to beg. 
He has begged them already.
[29:34] mama, obviously,
[29:36] papa considers Maheen his daughter.
[29:39] mama, let him handle it, what can I do?
[29:43] you are not getting it idiot,
[29:46] if your father in emotion agrees to the term,
[29:50] then Zakia will put us in it that brother you
 agreed to it, you get the car.
[29:56] Now tell me,
[29:57] another expense on our head,
[30:00] the dowry list is long and then another car.
[30:04] Why would we get it?
[30:05] Its obvious, a small car even cost 1 to 1.2 million,
[30:10] for the dowry I said yes,
[30:14] cause Zakia is worried I said 
yes to the dowry,
[30:18] now do we get into a debt for 
those greedy people.
[30:21] You put down the plate and 
get your father before he agrees.
[30:31] okay, I am going out. Maheen, 
child.. you rest, all is fine.
[30:42] is all ok?
[30:45] child, I said nothing, i will come.
[30:50] Mahi,
[30:53] I said it's nothing,
[30:55] you rest.
[30:57] If there is something us elders are here.
 Dont worry. where is mama?
[31:03] Najia, take care, I will come.
[31:06] you go, I will see.
[31:10] Mahi, all will be fine, dont worry.
[31:18] Leave it brother,
[31:20] I have heard elders saying that the
 time of wedding is a blessed time,
[31:25] we are wasting time in arguments.
[31:28] we are getting late, the guests have to go.
[31:40] we have to go Mr. Fareed?
[31:43] without the wedding? Dont do that.
[31:48] Look sister,
[31:50] we are respectable people
[31:51] and we dont like moving away from our word
[31:56] and in this situation it's not that 
we are ending the proposal for car,
[32:00] we have a heart too.
[32:04] why did you get up then?
[32:06] You said the wedding will be 
done on the night of the function,
[32:10] then let us fulfill our duty.
[32:14] Tell me something Mr. Fareed.
[32:16] Yes.
[32:17] are you fulfilling your duty or trying to 
get rid of the burden of the girl off your heads?
[32:24] We are giving you a chance
 to fulfill the duty as a duty.
[32:29] What do you mean?
[32:31] you have time till tomorrow,
[32:34] we will bring the family tomorrow
[32:36] and will marry your daughter too.
[32:45] In the same car. That is the dowry car.
[32:48] Brother. Brother, listen…
[32:51] Brother, don’t do that. Brother…
[32:55] I am talking, wait. Brother, Mr. Jahangir.
[33:01] Come on.Listen brother.
[33:05] That’s it. Hey, where did those people go?
[33:06] check outside. one minute Mr. Jahangir,

[33:10] what happened?
[33:13] Go see your father. Listen to me… 
We have heard enough
[33:16] What happened Zakia? 
When is the wedding?
[33:18] nothing, it will be tomorrow. Come on.
[34:10] Maheen.
[34:12] Maheen.
[34:13] Maheen.
[34:14] Maheen.
[34:16] God have mercy. Maheen. Maheen.
[34:19] Maheen.
[34:21] Maheen. Mansoor. Mansoor.
[34:27] Nabeel, I will talk to them tomorrow.
[34:31] But mama,
[34:32] please be careful of one thing you 
will not be pressurized by uncle.
[34:36] You will have the final decision.
[34:37] what is wrong son,
[34:39] your happiness is my happiness, 
I will make the decision you want.
[34:45] Hey, when will your mother come? 
I have been calling her for so long.
[34:49] I spoke to her, but…
[34:53] But what?
[34:54] If she was here, I would talk to her in detail.
[34:57] She wants that you go to her yourself and..
[35:00] No I stayed there for so long, I met all relatives,
I cannot go there again.
[35:19] why do you have a long face on everything,
[35:22] if you want, I can talk to aunty.
[35:25] you will talk to her?
[35:28] Its my decision, I will talk.
[35:31] she knows us for so long,
[35:35] I don’t think she will say no.
[35:38] It’s true we are distant relatives, 
but it’s the same family.
[35:45] but mama, I feel you 
should ask what Roshni thinks,
[35:52] it’s important for her to decide too.
[35:55] What objection can she have.
[35:58] Roshni, you will live with us, right?
[36:04] trust me, I don’t have an issue if you 
want to continue your education.
[36:08] If you want to go to an academy or 
home tuition I can arrange that.
[36:16] Hey no, I spoke to Zubaida,
[36:19] she doesn’t want to study,
[36:21] so she didn’t study beyond Fsc.
[36:24] mama, I feel girls should complete 
their education, right?
[36:27] Yes,
[36:28] I was thinking to tell Zubaida to stop 
worrying about her wedding,
[36:33] we will find a good proposal
and marry her here.
[36:37] what is wrong? Did you break something?
[36:40] Nothing madam, I am cleaning up.
[36:47] what happened?
[36:50] The long face again.
[36:52] Okay, we will not marry you without asking you.
[36:56] Fine, we will not fix your wedding 
without asking you. Mama, you worried her.
[37:01] fine, I won’t talk about it. I was just saying
 that I will talk to Zubeda that we took your responsibility,
[37:15] we will also fulfill the 
responsibility of your wedding.
[37:18] Her  burden will be reduced.
[37:20] We are not from the people who get money
 and forget their old relatives,
[37:26] I am always trying to help people out.
