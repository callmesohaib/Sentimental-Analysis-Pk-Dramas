[02:03] Happy birthday to you.
[02:09] Happy birthday to you.
[02:18] Happy birthday.
[02:21] Thank you.
[02:24] Cut It with me.
[02:25] Its your birthday, how can I cut it?
[02:28] I cannot cut it without you.
[02:34] Happy birthday to you.
[02:47] Hummm,
[02:49] Here, first you.
[02:51] No, you first.
[02:51] You first.
[02:52] No…
[03:04] Thank you
[03:11] for giving me these moments.
[03:14] I will always have this in the
treasure of my memories,
[03:20] because I only have memories.
[03:26] I don’t have you,
[03:29] nor you will ever be.
[03:32] Please Roshni, don’t say that.
[03:40] I am still yours like I was before.
[03:49] I love you Roshni.
[03:53] When I see you,
[03:56] I forget everything.
[04:00] A little more.
[04:01] Errr…
[04:03] You will have to eat a little more.
[04:06] I feel…
[04:07] I made it myself?
[04:08] Yeah.
[04:09] No, I didn’t make it myself.
[04:10] Hey, you are only feeding me.
[04:28] There you go, he cut the call again.
[04:30] Again?
[04:31] It would have been better had I not called.
[04:33] Give your beloved some shame.
[04:35] He can’t even tolerate someone
coming between him and his wife.
[04:39] Even if it’s the grandma or mother.
[04:44] Shameless, idiots.
Him and Mahi too.
[04:48] They got the grandma get
insulted in front of Razia.
[04:53] Its all Zakia’s doing.
[04:57] The way she is, what she did,
she has taught the same to her daughter.
[05:20] Mahi, you? Mama didn’t tell me.
[05:23] Humm,
[05:25] I told her not to,
I wanted to surprise you.
[05:29] Did Umar come or did
he drop you off and leave?
[05:32] He is here too.
[05:33] That’s surprising,
[05:35] it’s a great surprise.
[05:36] Had you told me, I wouldn’t have gone
to watch a movie with my friends,
[05:39] I would have taken
Umar along. Umar.
[05:41] He…
[05:43] he didn’t feel sleepy,
so he is upstairs on the roof.
[05:47] I will go get him.
[05:48] No, its late,
[05:51] you go, he will sit there all night long,
I will call him.
[05:54] You sleep, I need to chat with him.
[05:56] Umar. Umar.
[05:59] Umar, brother is here, come down.
[06:05] Yes,
[06:07] where were you man?
[06:09] I went to watch a movie.
[06:11] Where were you hiding?
[06:13] I was on the roof,
I was walking around.
[06:16] Why were you calling?
You could have come to the roof.
[06:19] Come on.
[06:20] Lets go.
[06:21] Mahi, get us tea.
[06:22] Come, lets get fresh.
[07:04] Listen, Mahi,
[07:05] tell mama I will come home 
early in the evening.
[07:10] Wont you come inside?
[07:12] No, papa is calling again and again, 
I will have to reach soon.
[07:15] Say hello to grandma.
[07:17] Listen,
[07:20] thank you.
[07:23] Why didn’t you wish me on my birthday?
[07:32] Happy birthday.
[07:35] Thank you.
[08:11] Hello aunt.
[08:13] Hello.
[08:16] Umar was saying he is going to work,
[08:20] he will come in the evening.
[08:26] What are you cooking? 
Should I help you?
[08:30] Its Umar’s birthday,
[08:32] I make food for him 
every time for his birthday.
[08:37] But today I will have 
to call and ask him.
[08:40] We might have to make rice for him.
[08:43] Why aunt.
[08:45] The day he has food from outside, 
he gets unwell.
[08:49] You people don’t have 
a decent hotel in your locality.
[08:51] God knows what you fed him.
[08:54] He cannot digest food from outside.
[08:58] Aunt,
[09:00] mama made food at home.
[09:19] I am considering myself really lucky that
[09:22] I am the one who congratulated 
you on your special day first.
[09:27] Me and my little happiness.
[09:31] Roshni.
[09:35] Roshni,
[09:36] I have a new news for you,
[09:38] you know I just heard that 
Shahista fixed her son’s wedding.
[09:45] She must have,
[09:47] they can go to hell. I don’t care.
[09:51] Well they wont get married secretly,
[09:54] when she calls me and invites, 
I will ask her then.
[09:59] Mama,
[10:00] no need to go to their wedding,
[10:02] if she calls you, just say no.
[10:05] Why?
[10:06] Are we thieves that we hide our face,
[10:08] or do we have a family feud?
[10:12] Shahista has treated you and me so badly,
[10:15] if she didn’t want to get her son married to you, 
she shouldn’t have given me hopes.
[10:18] At least let me ask them.
[10:21] Mama,
[10:23] I said no to their proposal,
[10:25] I said it to their face.
[10:28] Why do you want to lower 
yourself saying this to them?
[10:32] I don’t want to have any 
relation with them after today.
[10:36] Roshni,
[10:38] see you don’t tell me the truth.
[10:41] Tell me, why did you say no to the proposal.
[10:45] You were so restless to go there,
[10:48] if you don’t tell me honestly, 
how would I know?
[10:55] mama,
[10:57] what would you do knowing?
[10:59] ]You will only be hurt too.
[11:02] For you, knowing this is important that 
I will never be in loss,
[11:09] I can think what is best for me,
[11:11] don’t worry for me so much.
[11:14] If I don’t worry for you, 
then who do I worry for?
[11:51] Wow, I really appreciate you,
[11:55] you got your grandma really 
respected in front of Razia.
[11:58] I had told you,
[12:00] I had tried to tell you to 
be careful because I got you here.
[12:06] Razia will have eyes on every action of yours,
[12:09] and she will be sarcastic to me when possible.
[12:14] But did you care about that? No.
[12:19] Sorry grandma.
[12:20] Leave it. Sorry grandma.
[12:23] What good is this sorry?
[12:25] You are sitting there with 
an innocent face.
[12:29] You listened to your 
mother and got me insulted.
[12:32] All this has been taught by Zakia, right?
[12:38] No grandma
[12:39] I know it all, I know it all.
[12:43] Your mother has kept 
my son away from me.
[12:47] She knows how to control her husband,
[12:50] and she is teaching 
you the same,
[12:53] but listen to me Mahi,
[12:56] she kept my son away from his family,
[12:58] so he passed away 
or else it was not his age to go.
[13:03] His heart got weak,
[13:06] staying away from your own, 
a person is not happy.
[13:11] Look Mahi,
[13:13] no one stops you from 
going to your mother’s,
[13:17] going out and enjoying with your husband, 
no one stops you from it.
[13:22] But there is one 
day that is not just for you,
[13:26] but for everyone.
[13:30] Now on his birthday, 
everyone wanted to be together.
[13:39] This Razia loves creating a scene,
[13:43] she is in the room and she instigated me,
[13:47] I am upset with you now.
[13:49] Go, make me a good cup of tea. 
Go my child, go.
[13:58] Huh?
[14:07] Humm,
[14:08] This is really light,
[14:12] this is good,
[14:13] its dinner at uncle’s home day after,
[14:15] wear this.
[14:16] He gets upset when 
you wear something light.
[14:19] You know after marriage…
[14:20] I will wear this.
[14:21] This?
[14:23] Why don’t you wear a sari?
[14:25] Sari?
[14:28] I don’t like saris.
[14:31] But Umar likes it.
[14:34] Sister in law, there is no function, 
we are cutting the cake at home,
[14:37] I will wear this.
[14:39] Fine, wear this.
[14:41] Tell me something,
[14:42] what did you gift Umar?
[14:45] Gift?
[14:46] Yeah,
[14:47] I agree, we have a right on the gift,
[14:50] but at times when it’s a birthday or anniversary 
and you gift someone, they like it.
[14:57] He got happy.
[14:58] Really? What did you give?
[15:01] Exactly what he wanted.
[15:05] What?
[15:07] Same thing that got him happiness.
[15:12] Fine, you don’t want to tell me.
[15:16] When we become friends, you will tell me.
[15:22] Can I ask you something?
[15:25] Did you mind what mama said? 
She must have insulted you.
[15:30] No.
[15:32] Mahi, mama is good at heart,
[15:35] if she says something, just ignore it, 
don’t take it to heart.
[15:41] You know these days of the start of the 
marriage are really good, enjoy these.
[15:50] Okay.
[15:51] Should I keep this or will you keep it?
[15:53] I will keep it.
[15:54] Okay.
[15:54] Thank you sister in law.
[16:14] Roshni, that color suited you,
[16:18] in fact, I feel all colors 
have been made for you.
[16:21] I wish you were made for me too.
[16:24] Roshni,
[16:25] how do I make you believe it.
[16:28] I came to the roof, 
cause you asked me to.
[16:31] The whole family got upset.
[16:36] Family or just Maheen?
[16:39] Why would Maheen get upset?
[16:42] In fact, she knows it all,
[16:44] without her help we cannot meet.
[16:47] She has no objection on us meeting, 
would she not have an objection if we become one?
[16:53] What do you mean? I don’t get it.
[16:55] Don’t be naïve Umar, I said it clearly.
[16:59] How long will this go on for?
[17:01] Will she always help us to meet us on the roof,
[17:04] and show off the favor or will she really 
do something to make us one.
[19:06] Maheen,
[19:11] if you were in my place, 
what would you do?
[19:19] I am in a weird problem.
[19:25] I don’t have peace for a moment, 
not for a single moment,
[19:30] I am always restless, weird feeling of 
being on two routes at the same time.
[19:35] I think am I cheating you?
[19:40] But then I also think that
[19:43] I didn’t make any promises to you,
[19:48] I didn’t show off fake love,
[19:51] that I have cheated you.
[19:54] If I did this and still met Roshni,
[19:58] it would have been cheating, 
but its not like that right now.
[20:07] Maheen,
[20:10] say something.
[20:15] Sit.
[20:21] Tell me.
[20:25] What?
[20:27] That which I am asking you.
[20:31] You blamed yourself,
[20:35] then you gave justification 
and made it all fine.
[20:40] What can I say?
[20:44] How do I get out of this trouble?
[20:47] What trouble?
[20:50] Man,
[20:52] I consider myself a sinner at both places,
[20:54] in front of you and in front of Roshni too.
[21:01] That poor thing trusted my 
fake promises and is now alone.
[21:07] The relation I am in with you, 
I cannot live up to it either.
[21:15] I cannot fulfill the rights of either of you.
[21:22] Don’t consider yourself a sinner for me,
[21:26] you just said we don’t have such a relation,
[21:32] nor did you make any promises,
[21:35] and we never had such a relation that
[21:38] I would blame you for being unfaithful,
[21:41] so you don’t have to 
responsible for being faithful.
[21:47] but I have Roshni’s responsibility on me.
[21:51] She trusted my promises and waited.
[21:59] I want her to leave me, and move on, 
spend her life with someone else
[22:06] but she really loves me.
[22:10] She is willing to accept me in all cases, 
even with my helplessness.
[22:21] I have broken her heart once,
[22:26] if I break the poor things heart again,
[22:30] she will die and I wont let that happen.
[22:33] Why are you telling me all this?
[22:35] You are my friend,
[22:37] can I not talk to you?
[22:41] Should I hide it?
[22:43] I am saying it to lighten 
the burden on my heart.
[22:45] Has the burden gone down?
[22:50] Now listen,
[22:54] I don’t have an issue with 
your and Roshni’s relation,
[23:00] you people want to meet?
[23:04] I am not against it,
[23:07] I don’t say anything,
[23:11] but what more do you expect from me, 
I don’t get it.
[23:16] I am not in the middle, 
it was different earlier,
[23:22] now,
[23:25] now I cannot help you two meet.
[23:29] After what happened last night, 
everyone is upset with me,
[23:36] I cannot do it.
[23:38] this is weird Maheen, you are worried 
about your image, how are you behaving?
[23:42] What about what me and 
Roshni went through cause of you,
[23:46] don’t you see that?
[23:50] Because of me?
[23:52] Because of me?
[23:58] I found out at the time of 
wedding what was happening,
[24:05] I didn’t have the right to stop them,
[24:09] you had it Umar,
[24:11] you should have stopped them.
[24:14] If I am responsible in all of this,
[24:20] then isn’t my punishment 
enough that I give up my rights.
[24:25] That’s enough.
[24:27] But fighting for you and Roshni,
[24:33] that is something I cannot do.
[24:36] Sorry.
[24:52] You asked the question at the wrong place.
[24:55] What do you mean?
[24:58] Why would she want that we become one,
[25:01] she is your wife.
[25:04] I have told you so many times,
[25:06] Roshni, she is the same 
Maheen that she was before wedding,
[25:09] I am the same Umar, 
that I was before marriage.
[25:12] She has nothing for me in her heart.
[25:14] I am not talking about the heart,
[25:18] nor am I saying she loves you.
[25:21] Its not about love here, its about her right.
[25:26] Why would she give her up right? 
Why would she move out
[25:29] when she sees nothing in front of her.
[25:33] She got married for the first time with difficulty,
[25:35] how will she get married again?
[25:37] She is right,
[25:39] she thinks about her life, 
she should think about us?
[25:42] Where are you going?
[25:45] I am going.
[25:46] Where?
[25:47] Because you cannot do anything,
[25:49] and who did you ask for help?
[25:51] Someone there is no hope from.
[25:53] I will live my life with 
your memories Umar.
[25:59] I cannot forget you, Roshni,
[26:03] but I don’t want you to ruin your life cause of me.
[26:12] If I never imagine you being with someone else,
[26:16] its like death for me,
[26:22] but still you can choose anyone else,
[26:29] its up to you.
[26:32] I have loved you, Umar,
[26:35] and someone will have to live up to it.
[26:41] If you couldn’t live up to it, fine,
[26:44] I will do it.
[26:47] If spending life without you is difficult,
[26:51] I will make it easy too,
[26:54] I will die.
[26:56] Have you gone mad? 
Where are you going?
[26:57] Roshni, wait. Roshni, 
where are you going?
[27:00] You wont do anything like this, are you mad?
[27:02] You don’t do anything and 
don’t let me do anything, what do you want?
[27:06] Roshni, for God’s sake, 
try and understand.
[27:09] I will fix it all slowly, 
I promise you,
[27:12] you give me some time.
[27:15] I promise, I will fix it all.
[27:18] Sit here.
[27:29] Please don’t say anything like this again.
[27:35] Aunt, I will make the kebabs.
[27:38] No, your uncle doesn’t like 
anyone else made kebabs.
[27:42] Fine, you tell me how do it, 
I will make them like you.
[27:47] Fine, you make the kababs, 
tell me something else to do.
[27:50] No, I do it daily, I will do it.
[27:53] Yes, but I am here,
[27:56] with me here, how can you be busy.
[28:02] Will you have tea? Should I make it?
[28:05] Yes, I will definitely have it with you, 
but you sit.
[28:08] Hey, I don’t want to 
sit on the throne like mama.
[28:12] I can make tea.
[28:13] Hello.
[28:15] How much sugar.
[28:16] What is going on?
[28:16] Fine.
[28:18] You know since you have come Maheen,
[28:21] we get to smell great food from the kitchen.
[28:23] Yes, earlier we didn’t cook anything.
[28:26] You take everything I say wrong, 
Maheen, can I get a cup of oil.
[28:33] Wait Maheen,
[28:36] you have made this a regular practice.
[28:38] How does your monthly grocery end like this,
[28:41] keep things in track.
[28:43] You are really smart about other things,
[28:46] fashion, going out, your job,
[28:49] you still don’t know how much expense you 
will have in a month and what groceries you need.
[28:53] You will stay stupid this way.
[28:55] Oh God, so much bitterness,
[28:57] I am your son’s wife,
[28:59] will you insult me so much for a cup of oil.
[29:02] Care a little.
[29:04] Okay fine, once your son comes from the office,
[29:07] I will send him to get oil and then I will return 
2 cups back to you, happy now? tired,
[29:12] Wow, you are really 
showing a lot of heart today.
[29:17] You are talking about returning.
[29:20] You think my son takes money off the tree,
[29:21] and you are spending it like anything 
and in the end you get a cup to my door.
[29:26] You know, you never 
accepted me with your heart,
[29:30] I wish you had told this to your son too, 
I would have been out of this hell.
[29:33] Be quiet.
[29:35] He was in love,
[29:37] I would never have made 
you my daughter in law.
[29:40] Aunt, you please stop.
[29:42] Let her speak,
[29:44] her day doesn’t pass till she insults me,
[29:48] can I say something?
[29:49] You know I didn’t have the luck or the rights,
[29:51] or I would never make someone 
like you my mother in law.
[29:54] Give it back, I don’t want it.
[29:56] See, did you see it yourself,
[29:59] this girl is so ill-mannered and shameless.
[30:01] Your mother used to think that 
I am a bad mother in law,
[30:04] someone ask me how this 
ill-mannered girl tries to rule us.
[30:09] Aunt, fix your mood, 
I fixed it with difficulty, lets have tea.
[30:14] Fine, we will have it, 
I will make it.
[30:17] Pour the oil and give it to her,
[30:18] she will send my son 
when he comes tired.
[30:31] You call me so far to meet, 
can we not meet near home?
[30:35] Is there a spot near home,
[30:38] tell me.
[30:40] You will be scared that 
someone will see us.
[30:43] Are you afraid of people or your in-laws,
[30:47] that if someone from there sees you.
[30:51] I am not afraid of them,
[30:54] I will just have to get beaten by papa.
[30:57] You will have to get beaten one day,
[31:01] be a little strong, take a step.
[31:07] Or else I will die and 
I will make your life easy.
[31:10] Same thing again,
[31:12] I told you to give me some time.
[31:16] Please,
[31:19] all will be fine, give me some time.
[31:24] What do I do Umar?
[31:27] I cannot live without you 
and meeting you is a pain.
[31:31] I lied at home that 
I am going to meet Maheen.
[31:41] How is she?
[31:45] Fine.
[31:47] Happy?
[31:49] how would I know?
[31:52] She will be happy,
[31:55] the prayers I made didn’t get answered,
[32:00] she got what I deserved in an instance.
[32:06] I am what you deserve,
[32:09] and I am yours, not hers.
[32:29] haha,
[32:31] mama look at Umar, 
he looks like a unique groom.
[32:35] Yeah, look at his face, 
he is so lost.
[32:39] All this happened all of a sudden, 
but the reception…
[32:43] Mama, look at this picture of your son 
with Afzal uncle, he looks so happy.
[32:50] Yeah
[32:50] Although he created a scene
at aunt Ruqaiya’s home.
[32:55] Fareed is really stupid.
[32:58] Not a single picture of the bride and 
groom is worth enlarging,
[33:03] I paid the photographer for no reason, 
I could have taken pictures from my phone.
[33:07] Yeah, true.
[33:07] I will ask Umar to go to 
a studio and get a photo shoot done.
[33:11] Yes, than that picture, 
I will place here. Right here.
[33:18] I will put it up here.
[33:21] It wont be that big, 
you wanted to cover the window.
[33:23] Yes, only this portion.
[34:02] Roshni was asking about you.
[34:09] In fact, when she asked, I realized
[34:13] I never asked you.
[34:16] What?
[34:19] That,
[34:21] are you happy or not?
[34:44] I am happy.
[34:46] Why wont I be happy?
[34:50] Now she will ask you,
[34:54] why am I happy?
[34:56] Tell her that because
[34:58] you don’t consider me 
responsible for all this.
[35:10] Maheen, the three of us 
are suffering for no reason.
[35:14] How long will we suffer?
[35:21] I don’t know when this 
punishment will end.
[35:27] You know, Roshni is 
less helpless as compared to us,
[35:35] she can free herself 
from this hell and punishment,
[35:40] if you set her free from yourself.
[35:54] Mahi, I cannot do this at any cost.
[35:56] Umar, don’t take me wrong,
[35:59] I don’t have an issue with Roshni’s existence. 
Umar, I know she is hurt,
[36:05] but if
[36:07] she forgets all this and starts a new life,
[36:14] then the burden on your heart will reduce
[36:17] and new doors will open for her.
[36:25] She wants to sit on the 
same door and wait for me.
[36:34] If I cannot make her mine,
[36:38] then I cannot even force 
her to give up loving me.
[36:50] She hopes that our 
love will have results,
[36:59] she feels that the two 
of us will become one, someday.
