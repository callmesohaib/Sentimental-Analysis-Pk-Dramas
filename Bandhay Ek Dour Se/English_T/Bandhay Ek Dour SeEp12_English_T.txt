[00:27] Umar?
[00:30] Hello.
[00:32] what are you doing?
[00:33] What happened? What did I do?
[00:36] Why did you come here?
[00:37] Oh,
[00:39] are you scared?
[00:42] hummm,
[00:44] I am not scared.
[00:47] Yes, I am scared for you.
[00:51] This drama of being happy,
[00:54] what if you get sad cause of it.
[00:56] That is why I worry for you.
[00:58] Why did you come here?
[01:00] Without a reason?
[01:03] Why are you testing your patience?
[01:06] Why are you tormenting me and yourself.
[01:10] Don’t do this,
[01:12] I am embarrassed,
[01:15] I am in pain that I did something
so bad to you and you are so good.
[01:22] Stop it Umar,
[01:24] you are scared cause of Maheen,
[01:27] what if she minds it,
or she finds out everything, right?
[01:37] Tell me something…
[01:41] What will she find out?
She knows it all.
[01:46] It was different earlier,
[01:48] she is your wife now.
[01:51] When your first love comes in front of his wife,
the person gets scared,
[01:55] just like you.
[01:58] Roshni,
Maheen is not just my friend,
[02:01] she is yours too,
that too childhood friend.
[02:04] She cannot get jealous of anyone,
she is a plain, innocent girl.
[02:10] If she doesn’t realize our love,
who will?
[02:15] I swear to God, she is sad.
[02:18] She is sadder than us,
that she came between us.
[02:23] Maheen is not plain,
nor is she innocent.
[02:27] Umar,
[02:28] I feel that you are stupid.
[02:31] Look, Maheen is a woman
[02:33] and a woman cannot share.
[02:37] Look at me,
[02:38] I am happily here to be
part of your happiness
[02:42] and look at her face for a moment,
[02:46] she has gone pale.
[02:50] Look Roshni, she…
[02:57] Man,
[02:58] she is my wife for the world,
[03:01] not for me.
[03:03] For me she is my friend,
my best friend from my childhood,
[03:07] someone I can share my happiness and sorrows with,
I can share everything with her.
[03:12] Okay,
[03:13] then go share your happiness
and sorrows with her,
[03:17] have you come here to tell
me Maheen’s greatness.
[03:19] Roshni, no I…
[03:20] That’s it.
[03:52] Do you remember my dowry,
[03:54] it was like they got
rid of a responsibility.
[03:58] And here,
[03:59] great dresses were made in 2 days.
[04:03] Old family jewels were given.
[04:07] My family said so much to me,
[04:10] that these are the
people you were dying to marry.
[04:14] Are these really those people?
[04:21] Yes,
[04:23] why would you speak
in my favour,
[04:25] but you will give
justifications for your mother.
[04:29] Ok, fine, this is to be done,
[04:32] I was from outside the family,
[04:34] Maheen is family.
[04:36] Fine, I agree they differentiated
between the two daughter in laws,
[04:40] but why the sons,
[04:41] they are their own, then why the difference?
[04:48] What happened?
[04:50] We did injustice Najia.
[04:53] Thank God,
[04:54] you finally realize that what
happened with us is injustice.
[05:00] Hey, no.
[05:05] Maheen and Umar.
[05:20] You look really good.
[05:24] This is what everyone said today, right?
[05:28] That is why you are not changing.
[05:30] I don’t know how girls wear
such heavy clothes and jewellery.
[05:36] These are envelopes for
the money we collected.
[05:46] Count it,
[05:49] like we used to gather
together and count our Eidi,
[05:53] just think that we got promoted.
[06:09] Why did Roshni come, 
Umar?
[06:19] She came from your side
[06:23] with aunt Zakia,
[06:25] she must have invited her.
[06:27] But why did she come?
[06:32] She is your friend, s
[06:33] he must have come to meet you. 
You tell me.
[06:39] My friend?
[06:41] Was she not your friend,
[06:44] or maybe,
[06:47] she is.
[06:51] What do you want to say?
[06:55] She came for you Umar.
[06:58] Really?
[06:59] Yes,
[07:00] I don’t get it,
[07:02] why does she come in front 
of your again and again,
[07:07] what does she want?
[07:10] What do you want?
[07:14] I mean,
[07:15] saying all this, 
what do you want to prove?
[07:22] Speak up, Maheen.
[07:24] It all happened in front of you,
[07:27] why do you act like you know nothing. 
You know it all.
[07:32] Her heart was broken, 
her trust was broken.
[07:38] What do we do?
[07:42] Become strangers 
when we see each other?
[07:45] Refuse to recognize each other? 
Tell me Maheen.
[07:50] I am the one 
who should hide from her,
[07:53] what did she do that she 
should stay hidden from us?
[07:57] Its all her doing,
[07:59] she went away cause 
it was in her benefit then
[08:03] and you were not ready 
to hear anything
[08:06] and now she came 
back when she wanted.
[08:08] She is doing what she wants at a place, 
where she has no right now.
[08:15] I am really disappointed, Maheen.
[08:18] You are saying all this for Roshni?
[08:23] I got it.
[08:25] You have given importance to being my wife, 
to us being friends. That’s the deal, right?
[08:42] Najia, its not that Umar 
loves someone else,
[08:48] the more painful thing is that Maheen 
is the secret keeper of his love.
[08:57] This is double the torment.
[09:00] If Umar forgets that girl in the future,
[09:05] maybe Maheen cannot forget that the one
[09:11] she married doesn’t love her,
 he loves someone else.
[09:14] And Umar,
[09:16] how will he forget?
[09:21] Even if he wants, in Maheen’s face, 
he will see her again and again.
[09:32] You felt that such a good, ,
[09:35] cute love story had a great climax.
[09:41] Surprising end.
[10:01] Her heart’s broken, 
her trust has been broken.
[10:11] How can you say all this?
[10:14] Have you forgotten that your heart and trust 
was broken when she left from here,
[10:22] you didn’t do 
anything not knowing,
[10:25] but she stepped back 
knowing everything, the benefit.
[10:33] Maheen, why are you repeating this?
[10:36] Why are you saying this 
to me again and again.
[10:39] Are you in your senses?
[10:40] Senses?
[10:42] Umar,
[10:43] you need to come 
back to your senses.
[10:47] You don’t hear me.
[10:52] I don’t understand 
why she is doing this?
[10:56] Why…
[10:58] why is she not telling 
you the reality?
[11:00] Umar, she clearly told me to 
tell you the truth.
[11:04] What truth and 
what reality are you talking about?
[11:11] That she is disappointed in you
[11:19] and impressed 
by someone else.
[11:26] I can’t even call this love,
[11:28] because love doesn’t happen 
by fortune, cars and homes,
[11:35] but still, there 
was someone else.
[11:37] Shut up Maheen.
[11:38] There was a third person.
[11:39] Shut up.
[11:39] Someone else came between you two.
[11:41] Not another word.
[11:42] For him she left you.
[11:45] If she didn’t tell you,
then shouldn’t I tell you either?
[11:48] She told me.
[11:50] The way she said no to the proposal 
for me and came back here for me.
[11:58] Said no?
[12:00] Yes, she said no.
[12:02] look at me. Look at me.
[12:05] You thought you would tell me a 
false story and turn me against her.
[12:09] You will take her away from me. 
Look at me, I am talking to you.
[12:14] You had to give me this false story? 
Why are you lying to me?
[12:20] Why would I lie?
[12:22] Because you…
[12:27] because you are no longer my friend…
[12:31] Umar…
[12:32] I was so stupid to believe 
you are my childhood friend,
[12:35] a good friend,
[12:37] you will hear everything…
[12:39] but Maheen you shouldn’t have lied,
[12:46] at least our friendship would have survived.
[12:48] Umar…
[12:51] Stop it man.
[13:56] The bread is dry, we have a new bride, 
at least think of that.
[14:00] There is omelet too.
[14:02] Ahhh,
[14:03] Hello.
[14:04] live long.
[14:06] Now look Farid,
[14:07] what did I say that she is frowning?
[14:11] I just said set the table well 
for the new bride who has come.
[14:16] Now you see yourself,
[14:17] this dry bread and the 
useless egg has been served.
[14:22] I have spent my life 
trying to please you,
[14:25] now I need to please the 
new bride that came.
[14:28] The new bride has not served me 
anything for me or even ask.
[14:36] For God’s sake don’t ruin the breakfast.
[14:40] Mama, Maheen is no guest, 
he is a family member
[14:45] and Razia couldn’t you tell 
Umar to get something and bring it.
[14:48] Umar would have got it himself if he wanted.
[14:52] You too, are spoiling your 
daughter in laws one after the other.
[14:58] Hello.
[15:00] Hello. Where is Mahi?
[15:03] She must be in the room.
[15:05] What is wrong?
[15:06] You should wait for her, 
she must be coming. You have started eating.
[15:10] Papa, I don’t know 
if she wants to eat or not.
[15:13] I have something important to do.
[15:16] Do you remember, 
we have lunch at Zakia’s.
[15:20] I won’t be able to go, you people go.
[15:23] I will go to work, I have to see that too.
[15:25] Hey, what is wrong? 
Its your in-laws, why won’t you go?
[15:31] Umar, go son or I will be blamed for 
not letting you go to your in laws.
[15:38] What are you guys on about?
[15:41] Its my aunt’s home, you don’t need to 
remind me they are my in-laws too.
[15:52] ohh,
[15:53] look at his mannerism,
[15:56] he is married to rich class.
[15:58] Mama, you should be happy,
[16:01] your son used to visit his in-laws often
[16:04] and you used to be sad about it.
[16:08] Now Umar is doing what you wanted.
[16:13] Me or you?
[16:16] Razia, you should be happy.
[16:18] You relaxed that
[16:20] he had breakfast alone,
[16:21] unlike Mansoor who used to wait for his wife.
[16:25] He didn’t salute his wife before going,
[16:28] he went alone.
[16:30] Razia, you distribute sweets,
[16:34] not Mansoor, 
but this boy is your real blood.
[16:38] For God’s sake,
[16:40] stop it you two. You don’t leave a moment to argue, 
at least have breakfast quietly.
[17:00] I was so mad, 
I thought you were my childhood friend,
[17:03] my best friend,
[17:05] someone who would listen to 
everything I say and understand.
[17:08] I wish you had not lied,
[17:10] at least our friendship 
would have been saved.
[17:34] you were right, Roshni.
[17:37] You were absolutely right about Maheen.
[17:45] I don’t know when I said this,
[17:48] I don’t know why I was not proved wrong.
[17:52] Maheen wasn’t this dark at heart.
[17:57] I don’t know what happened to her.
[18:00] Jealously.
[18:03] You should be jealous, 
you took her place.
[18:09] Umar, look in my eyes and say that
[18:12] the place I had in your heart, 
its now Maheen’s.
[18:18] What are you saying Roshni?
[18:22] Can someone take your place?
[18:25] Never.
[18:28] No one can take your place,
[18:31] I love you.
[18:36] This is the faith that doesn’t 
let me get jealous of her
[18:40] and this is something that is 
tormenting her that you are mine,
[18:45] married to her and you are 
not her even when you are with her.
[18:54] I am surprised,
 she knew everything about us.
[19:00] She is my friend, 
she knows it all from the start.
[19:03] It takes a woman’s heart to change,
[19:05] but their thinking changes in a moment.
[19:10] I sympathize with her, 
if someone else was in her place,
[19:15] he would have felt the same way. But the blame
 she has put on me, that is painful.
[19:18] Yes,
[19:20] that is something that is hurting me,
[19:22] I am thinking of what she said.
[19:25] How can she even say that?  
I am glad you had told me earlier.
[19:27] Or else…
[19:27] Or else you would have believed her.
[19:30] Never.
[19:32] That I left you for someone rich.
[19:35] Not at all.
[19:37] No matter what the world says about you,
[19:41] I really love you Roshni,
[19:44] from my heart.
[19:47] There is nothing wrong about you in my 
heart and there never can be.
[20:11] Who is it?
[20:13] No one.
[20:15] Will you eat something? 
Listen man, come here.
[20:27] What do you want to have?
[20:28] What ever you will have.
[20:39] Mahi, has Monis not got 
kebabs from the market?
[20:42] No. Should I help you?
[20:45] No, you sit with your mother and father in law.
[20:48] What will they think that the daughter in law came 
to her mother’s home and started helping her.
[20:53] mama, I am not a guest.
[20:56] My child, you are a guest.
[20:59] Monis is getting everything from the market, 
I am not doing much,
[21:01] you go sit with your in-laws, come on go. Go.
[21:05] Did Umar not come?
[21:08] No Umar had something to do. 
You get ready,
[21:11] you haven’t changed?
[21:13] Yes, I will once I prepare this.
[21:47] What happened?
[21:50] Why are you so surprised?
[21:55] I didn’t even see you with this surprise,
[21:59] when you and Umar…
[22:04] anyway.
[22:07] How are you?
[22:16] After marriage, does someone 
meet their old friend like this,
[22:20] with such ill feelings?
[22:29] As soon as I found out you are coming, 
I came running.
[22:35] Aunt Zakia said
[22:37] you were in the room,
[22:39] calling Umar when he will come.
[22:46] Umar won’t come, Maheen.
[22:49] he won’t come or are you 
stopping him from coming?
[23:04] If I had to stop him, 
I would have stopped him earlier,
[23:08] but you tried to stop him
[23:11] and because of this 
he has moved away from you.
[23:16] What did I do?
[23:18] You are instigating Umar against me,
[23:20] making him think negative of me?
[23:23] How can you do this Maheen?
[23:25] You have any idea how bad Umar took it.
[23:39] Stop it Roshni,
[23:41] who are you cheating? Me?
[23:43] Who knows everything.
[23:46] Everything that Umar doesn’t know, that is what I was telling Umar.
[23:51] You know nothing.
[23:53] You are using a baseless thing 
and taking Umar away from me
[23:59] and I on the other hand is telling 
him to live a happy life with Maheen,
[24:05] she is your own, start a new life with him. 
I am making ways for you
[24:09] and you are poisoning him for me.
[24:13] Lower your voice.
[24:14] And I am not poisoning him,
[24:16] I am telling him the truth. 
The truth you told me to tell him and you,
[24:21] you separated ways yourself, 
you picked your way,
[24:25] then why are you so bothered 
about me and Umar?
[24:30] Why do you ask him to start a new life? 
Why don’t you start a new life with Nabeel?
[24:34] What new route? What new life?
[24:37] Lower your voice.
[24:38] All that was a joke.
[24:43] Joke?
[24:46] Yes, joke.
[24:50] I wanted to bother Umar.
[24:53] I had thought that
[24:55] I will make you my confidant and bother Umar.
[24:58] Then I thought that you are 
more close to Umar than me
[25:06] but how was I to know that
[25:08] you are looking for a moment that something happens 
between us and you take advantage.
[25:14] All that was a joke?
[25:16] Yes.
[25:19] How was I to know that I will lose Umar in this joke?
[25:28] But anyway,
[25:30] I am empty handed so what?
[25:36] You got someone like Umar.
[25:40] Roshni…
[25:42] But Maheen, doing such cheap 
hings you will drag Umar away.
[25:49] Umar still loves me, 
he won’t tolerate a word against me.
[25:56] Roshni…
[25:57] I sympathize with you,
[26:00] so I came to give you a suggestion.
[26:08] Look, I have lost everything,
[26:11] but if you take my curse 
Maheen you won’t be able to live peacefully.
[26:21] Be scared of God Maheen.
[26:24] You did wrong.
[26:32] Roshni.
[27:40] Umar hasn’t come yet.
[27:42] He must be stuck with work.
[27:47] Even today?
[27:49] A man has a 1000 things to do,
[27:52] now should he focus on work or feasts?
[27:56] Zakia, I think serve food.
[27:58] Monis, you call him.
[28:01] Grandma,
[28:02] he is not answering his wife’s phone, 
how will he pick mine?
[28:49] Sorry.
[28:53] Are you saying it with your 
heart or just like that?
[28:56] From my heart, Umar.
[29:06] Umar, I am saying it with my heart,
[29:09] although whatever happened 
was a misunderstanding,
[29:13] I didn’t want to do wrong with anyone,
[29:20] but I made a mistake.
[29:22] I am sorry.
[29:29] Maheen, I am not hurt that you 
said something about Roshni,
[29:34] but I am sad that you said it.
[29:39] I didn’t expect this from you.
[29:42] I know you won’t hurt anyone,
[29:45] still after that.
[29:50] Look Maheen,
[29:52] I really like you since childhood,
[29:55] and a person wants that those he likes, 
he continues to like them.
[30:24] No, why should I not ask him? Its my right.
[30:28] I want to know why he didn’t come last night.  
Call him.
[30:32] What wrong did he not do by not coming?
[30:35] A man has 1000 things to do,
[30:37] what wrong did he do by not coming to his in-laws. 
What crime did he commit?
[30:42] I know it well,
[30:43] I know it all.
[30:45] Its women like you who do not 
tolerate a son settling in his home.
[30:50] Grandma.
[30:54] What happened to you early morning? 
Why are you so upset?
[30:57] I should scold you,
[31:00] you are listening to your mother.
[31:02] Tell me honestly,
[31:03] your mother told you not to come to 
Zakia’s in the evening.
[31:07] Look Umar,
[31:09] she is your mother, but its not important to 
agree to everything your mother says.
[31:14] How will you settle in your home?
[31:17] Grandma just don’t say things, 
she didn’t say no to me.
[31:21] What hell broke loose that 
I didn’t go to a feast?
[31:24] Mama was scolding me last night.
[31:27] Lie!
[31:28] She was scolding you! 
Like I don’t know your mother’s cunningness.
[31:46] mama thinks everyone is like her,
[31:49] she thinks I will repeat what she did.
[31:54] After all her cunningness,
[31:57] if her son’s home got settled, 
my son’s will too.
[32:01] Hello aunt.
[32:03] Hello. I am making breakfast, 
till then go sit with your grandma,
[32:09] maybe her anger will go down.
[32:11] I will help you,
[32:13] I will roll it and you can fry it.
[32:16] :No leave it, your grandma is already upset
[32:20] and she will say that I am making the 
new bride work in the kitchen.
[32:24] Why would grandma say that?
[32:26] She told me herself that you have a lot 
of burden and I should support you.
[32:32] Mama will never say that.
[32:35] Fine, if you want to work, then make tea.
[32:40] You know aunt, I can make bread. Really good.
[32:46] I know, I have had bread you make,
[32:48] or else Zakia has no flavor in her hands.
[32:51] I don’t know where you learned from.
[32:54] Fine child, if you are so restless, 
tomorrow is Sunday,
[32:57] I will make you prepare sweets.
[32:59] Fine.
[33:01] Go to her now.
[33:10] Yes Umar,
[33:12] what did you think? 
When are you taking Maheen out.
[33:17] Wow, is the honeymoon planned?
[33:20] No, no preparation but 
I think tomorrow is a Sunday,
[33:23] leave for Murree in the evening tomorrow.
[33:26] What do you think?
[33:27] Yeah.
[33:27] No, I want her to prepare sweets tomorrow, they will go after that.
[33:32] What is the hurry? Let her be here for a week.
[33:34] Mama, I am in no hurry, she came to me herself. Ask her.
[33:38] Why?
[33:40] Yes grandma, I asked her.
[33:46] Papa, I was thinking we will go in a week, 
what is the hurry?
[33:51] Umar, the weather is really good there.
[33:53] Yes Umar, stay a day in Islamabad with your uncle.
[33:58] There you go, she never misses a chance.
[34:01] Mama.
[34:04] I would suggest,
[34:06] leave Murree, go somewhere else,
[34:09] Naran, Kaghan, Hunza.
[34:19] Uncle,
[34:21] its Umar’s birthday day after tomorrow,
[34:24] we will all celebrate it together and then go.
[34:32] Yes, you can’t enjoy the birthday outside home.
[34:37] Wow, we didn’t remember.
[34:41] Good the one who remembers is here.
[34:44] Nothing like that, 
I am his mother, I remembered.
[34:47] I was just checking if someone 
else remembers or not.
[35:19] Hello.
[35:21] The whole day passed and you didn’t call.
[35:25] I was unwell.
[35:28] What happened? All ok?
[35:30] I am not well and after all,
[35:32] I went to meet Maheen,
[35:36] so I had a weird sorrow in my heart.
[35:40] You met Maheen?
[35:42] Yeah.
[35:43] I went to talk to Maheen that
[35:45] don’t be afraid of me and not 
to make you sad cause of me.
[35:51] Look Umar,
[35:52] I cannot see you sad and worried.
[35:58] I had thought
[36:00] when I would be part of your life,
[36:03] I will love you more than I can,
[36:06] but that couldn’t happen.
[36:08] So now I want that at least 
Maheen keeps you happy.
[36:17] Happiness is not something you 
can buy and give to someone.
[36:22] I made you sad, 
still you are thinking of my happiness.
[36:30] I feel you spoke to Maheen, 
that is why she was apologizing to me.
[36:40] Maheen apologized?
[36:44] Yes.
[36:46] Then maybe she realized that
[36:50] or maybe she didn’t
[36:53] or maybe still in her heart…
[36:58] I don’t know. Umar, I am unwell,
[37:03] I will just say that 
don’t call or message me again.
[37:08] Forget me Umar. Bye.
[37:12] Roshni…
[37:22] I can never forget her.
