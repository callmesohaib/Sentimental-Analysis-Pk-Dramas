[00:20] If it was just about Umar,
[00:21] we would have beaten him up
and made him understand,
[00:24] but we are upset with her,
[00:26] she is supporting Umar.
[00:29] She has almost convinced her father in law.
[00:32] Zakia, talk to your daughter,
make her understand,
[00:35] I am worried that she will leave
alone taking her husband as a groom.
[00:40] We have been made fun of,
people have cursed us,
[00:45] but Zakia, you too will have to get
your daughter sit at home.
[00:49] She doesn’t want to live in her home,
she wants others to live in that home.
[00:53] Mama.
[00:54] What are you doing?
[00:54] Get out of my way.
[00:55] Leave her. Leave her.
[00:58] Leave me.
[00:58] Leave her Zakia. Leave her.
Stop Zakia. Leave her.
[01:07] Zakia, stop it.
[01:08] You are my son in law,
so I cannot raise my hand on you.
[01:11] Or else what her fault is,
you have a bigger mistake.
[01:14] Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
[01:16] Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
[01:19] Umar. Umar, take her inside,
[01:21] Zakia will kill her.
[01:23] You should have thought of this earlier,
[01:25] you are calling aunt Zakia,
and complaining about her,
[01:27] this will happen.
[01:29] Everyone hear me clearly,
[01:31] no one punish Maheen for what I did.
[01:34] Come on Maheen.
[01:51] This girl has ruined me.
[01:55] she has ruined my peace, Umar too.
[01:58] I will get water.
[01:59] Yes.
[02:01] Relax.
[02:20] Maheen.
[02:22] Maheen, I am sorry.
[02:25] Maheen, sorry, 
all this is because of me.
[02:27] No.
[02:28] No.
[02:29] all this is because of me,
[02:31] had I not come in your way,
[02:34] your path would have been easier.
[02:37] But I too have ruined your path because of me,
[02:41] I am so selfish,
[02:44] I did something so wrong,
[02:47] for my work, for myself, I put you in front.
[02:51] You got blamed for everything.
[02:54] To be honest, I felt that if you agree,
[02:59] the whole family would agree easily
or else they might never agree.
[03:03] But I didn’t know all this would happen.
[03:07] Okay, please stop crying Maheen.
[03:12] I am not crying because of you,
[03:15] I am crying because of my mother.
[03:18] I never wanted to hurt her,
but I gave her pain.
[03:27] Even I never wanted to hurt you,
[03:31] but I did.
[03:34] I am not hurt Umar,
[03:37] I am fine.
[03:43] Sorry Maheen.
[03:47] You have to hear so much,
[03:50] you have to go through so much.
[03:56] Now no more.
[03:59] I…
[04:03] I will fight my battle myself.
[04:12] I am sorry.
[04:28] What was the need to raise your hand on the daughter,
what is her fault in it?
[04:31] How do I raise my hand on
the one who is at fault, brother?
[04:37] The one whose responsibility it is
to raise his hand on, he has given up.
[04:42] What do you mean?
[04:43] Is there just one solution for all problems?
[04:45] Raising your hand on your young children?
[04:48] But brother, at least give me enough permission
to stop Maheen from doing what she is doing.
[04:52] If the wife gets stubborn,
[04:54] especially when the in-laws are standing with her,
[04:57] then the husband won’t
dare go anywhere else.
[05:00] This thankless girl doesn’t see this
that the in-laws are with her,
[05:05] she is willing to ruin her life herself.
[05:11] Okay sister in law,
[05:13] I will leave now.
[05:15] I have one request with
you people to stand with her,
[05:19] put some sense into her head.
[05:22] This widow doesn’t have the courage to see
my divorced daughter standing at my door now.
[05:26] God forbid Zakia.
[05:28] Brother, I don’t know
why you are taking Umar’s side,
[05:31] what is your helplessness,
[05:32] I just know that I gave you my daughter,
[05:36] its your responsibility to make her settle down in this home,
[05:40] if you send her back,
[05:41] I will kill her and die myself too.
[05:44] Zakia…
[06:08] Bad time has come on me today,
[06:10] you left me,
[06:13] you left me alone,
stopped talking to me.
[06:17] You got upset with me yourself
and now you are being stubborn.
[06:22] Mama was right,
[06:25] men like you consider a girl a toy
and play with her emotions,
[06:30] you have shown your
true colors really soon, Umar.
[06:33] I was just a temporary entertainment for you,
[06:36] you just wanted to play,
[06:37] you wanted to enjoy, you did that,
[06:39] and now you left me, right?
[06:44] You did wrong with me, Umar.
[06:47] You did really wrong.
[06:50] And you have left me alone at this time.
[06:53] I am all alone.
[07:27] You had said your friendship
with Maheen is the same,
[07:33] then ask Maheen as a friend who she likes,
[07:38] who is in her heart.
[07:42] Please Roshni…
[07:43] Look, listen. Listen to me,
[07:45] this way you will not be blamed alone,
[07:48] you can tell your family
that Maheen’s will was in it,
[07:51] because Maheen likes someone else.
[08:08] Roshni, open the door.
[08:10] Open the door.
[08:11] Mama, leave.
[08:12] Open the door.
[08:13] Mama, I don’t want to talk, leave.
[08:16] Open the door, I am telling you.
[08:19] You wanted to hit me, 
you have done that,
[08:21] I don’t want to talk about anything else now.
[08:23] Open the door, I am telling you.
[08:35] My phone!
[08:35] Leave my phone!
[08:36] Sit down!
[08:38] I have had enough.
[08:39] I won’t let you do this.
[08:41] What actions?
[08:44] We like each other,
[08:45] we want to get married,
 what is wrong in that?
[08:48] Shut your mouth!
[08:50] You have any idea,
[08:52] he is a married man
[08:54] and that too your friend Maheen’s husband.
[08:58] You have some consideration and
 shame for your friendship or not?
[09:02] Look at me,
[09:04] I have so much consideration
 and shame for the neighbors.
[09:06] You tell me,
[09:07] when everyone finds out,
 then how will we face her mother.
[09:10] Maheen knows everything.
[09:13] Nothing is hidden from Maheen.
[09:16] When I used to tell you that 
I am going to meet Maheen,
[09:19] I was not lying,
[09:20] Umar used to be with her.
[09:22] She has been making us meet.
[09:24] It doesn’t matter to her.
[09:27] Now do you feel like hitting me?
[09:29] Do you? Here, hit me. 
Hit me as much as you like.
[09:32] I will hit you!
[09:38] What am I hearing?
[09:41] What are you saying that 
Maheen let her husband…
[09:47] oh God,
[09:48] Maheen is spoiling my daughter
[09:53] and I am quiet because of 
consideration and shame.
[09:57] I will not leave Zakia,
 you will see what I do to her now!
[10:03] Mama, do what you want,
[10:05] but return my phone.
[10:07] No.
[10:08] Give me my phone.
[10:11] You won’t get this phone
[10:13] and if you argue with me
 further you will get beaten again.
[10:18] I will get you married within this week!
[10:22] Come on the right track, or I…
[10:25] Mama. Mama!
[10:50] Why did she switch off her phone?
[11:13] What do I do?
[11:21] Hey, are you keeping an eye on me,
[11:23] that when I come to the roof 
and you come to make fun of me.
[11:26] All this is not right Umar,
[11:29] the thing has left the home.
[11:30] I know man,
[11:31] her mother has found out,
[11:34] I don’t know how she must be treating her.
[11:37] All this has happened because of you.
[11:40] Aunt had to find out,
[11:42] but she took out all her anger on Maheen.
[11:45] I am not talking about Maheen,
[11:47] I am talking about Roshni, 
her mother has found out.
[11:52] Roshni?
[11:53] Roshni?
[11:55] Who Roshni?
[11:56] I don’t know how her 
family must be treating her,
[11:59] I am giving her sorrow.
[12:01] Just her?
[12:03] The whole family has received 
a lot of happiness from you?
[12:06] The whole house is awake Umar,
[12:09] no one has sleep in their eyes.
[12:11] And aunt Zakia,
[12:14] she must have a mourning in her home.
[12:16] And you,
[12:17] what was the name of that girl,
[12:19] yes, Roshni.
[12:20] You are worried about Roshni?
[12:22] I am worried about everyone.
[12:24] I am worried for everyone.
[12:26] I don’t want to hurt anyone,
[12:29] but the problem is no one is happy with me.
[12:31] What do I do?
[12:34] Brother Mansoor the truth
 is I am the most worried right now.
[12:38] You and worried?
[12:42] I wish you realized this Umar.
[12:46] I wish.
[13:56] Yes,
[13:57] did you console him?
[13:58] Did you wipe his tears?
[14:00] For God’s sake Najia, go to sleep.
[14:03] You are a man,
[14:04] your sympathies will be a man,
[14:06] yours and sadly papa’s as well.
[14:11] Nothing like that Najia,
[14:13] papa just wants to handle this 
matter with patience and care.
[14:16] Leave it. Leave it.
[14:18] He just stops at the point when he says 
that he forcefully got Umar married.
[14:24] Like he did something really wrong.
[14:27] Now he will make amends for it too,
[14:28] getting a bride Umar likes.
[14:31] Najia,
[14:33] the doctor has told you not to 
take tension without a reason,
[14:36] so you stay away from this matter.
[14:38] Rest, come on.
[14:39] Why?
[14:39] Why should I stay away from this matter?
[14:41] Sympathies with Maheen is another thing.
[14:42] It is a matter of principle.
[14:44] I will not let this happen in this home
[14:45] because the wrong custom is 
being created in this home.
[14:48] Today Umar is doing it, 
tomorrow you will find a reason.
[14:53] Najia, I don’t want to argue with you
 and make your BP shoot in this condition.
[14:57] So please let me be.
[14:59] I will not let leave that girl.
[15:01] Once I find out who she is, 
you will see what I do with her.
[15:07] Her name is Roshni,
[15:09] Umar just told me.
[15:12] Now you go and find out yourself, 
but not right now,
[15:15] let me sleep right now.
[15:27] Now you too sleep.
[16:14] Umar.
[16:17] I want to go to mama’s home today,
[16:20] I cannot stop myself 
after seeing her upset yesterday.
[16:24] I will go and convince her somehow, 
just drop me there.
[16:30] Maheen, I don’t think you going
 there would be right today.
[16:33] You please let the situation get under control.
[16:37] What will she do?
[16:39] Hit me more.
[16:40] Fine, she can hit me, she is my mother.
[16:43] And after all, 
the anger in her heart will be removed.
[16:46] You know there is love even 
in the beating of a mother.
[16:49] I will meet her, 
maybe she might get better.
[16:52] No, its not that,
[16:54] I feel that
[16:57] Roshni’s mother has found 
out about me and Roshni.
[17:02] What?
[17:03] I think.
[17:05] I feel this.
[17:07] Its not been that
[17:09] Roshni phone has been off for so long
[17:15] and if this is true,
[17:17] and if you go there you 
will have to face a lot.
[17:20] God knows what is going on there.
[17:25] Let it be confirmed.
[17:26] I don’t know if I read her message wrong,
 I don’t understand anything.
[17:31] Its more important for me to go in this situation,
[17:34] God knows what aunt must be saying to mama,
[17:36] I don’t know what her heart must be going through.
[17:39] She must not be alone at this time.
[17:41] Maheen, I will take you in the evening, myself.
[17:45] Please.
[18:23] Papa, I was just going, 
I thought I would say bye to you.
[18:25] Huh?
[18:26] Yeah.
[18:29] Umar, I was thinking that I come with 
you in a day or two, I have rested enough.
[18:36] No papa, the doctor has said 
that we cannot burden you,
[18:41] I mean till you get fine.
[18:44] If there is something let me know.
[18:47] Umar, there is a question.
[18:53] Go ahead, papa.
[18:56] I accept you have been mistreated,
[19:03] I also accept that
[19:06] its your religious right 
whatever you are asking for,
[19:12] but still I have a request.
[19:20] Umar, can you not step back?
[19:23] Can you not forget everything?
[19:26] For us?
[19:28] For Maheen?
[19:39] Papa, tell me something.
[19:44] Tying someone in the strings of promises
[19:51] if someone steps back, 
what sort of a person is he?
[19:57] You didn’t bring us up like this.
[20:02] I promised to that girl
[20:07] that I will bring her with respect.
[20:12] If I don’t live up to my promise,
[20:15] then
[20:18] I am not capable of giving her respect.
[20:23] I am a cheater, right?
[20:31] I cannot do this papa.
[20:37] Maybe,
[20:40] maybe, I might have done it for Maheen’s sake,
[20:47] but she has no such demands.
[20:51] She didn’t say this to me, ever.
[21:03] I don’t think it matter to her,
[21:06] that I have someone else in my life.
[21:10] It doesn’t matter to her at all.
[22:06] Her name is Roshni,
[22:07] Umar just told me.
[22:13] Roshni?
[22:15] Oh God,
[22:17] a face comes in front of 
my eyes hearing that name,
[22:20] but I don’t remember.
[22:29] I had a heavy heart since last night,
[22:33] I didn’t mention it to you,
[22:36] because in anger you might have…
[22:45] I told you something so big,
[22:48] are you not surprised or angry?
[22:52] I was surprised mama,
[22:54] I even got angry,
[22:55] when I found out about this the first time.
[22:58] What do you mean?
[23:00] You knew this from earlier and
 you were hiding it from me?
[23:05] Mama, Maheen made me promise.
[23:07] She asked for a few days that 
she will fix everything in this time.
[23:10] I didn’t know she was asking 
time for Umar’s wedding.
[23:13] I don’t know what is wrong with this girl.
[23:14] She got everything served to her.
[23:17] That is why she doesn’t respect it.
[23:20] I am shocked how easily 
she is giving her husband to a stranger.
[23:27] She is no stranger
[23:29] and Maheen is not giving him,
[23:31] she is snatching him away.
[23:32] I am surprised and angry at Maheen,
[23:35] that why has she given Roshni this freedom.
[23:41] What?
[23:46] What?
[23:49] Roshni?
[23:57] Roshni.
[24:02] Oh my God.
[24:09] Razia has given up,
[24:11] but I won’t.
[24:13] Find out that girl’s name and address,
[24:16] the both of us will go and insult her.
[24:19] Hey grandma, half of the work is done,
[24:22] don’t worry, I will find out the address too.
[24:26] Talk to this Maheen.
[24:29] She doesn’t understand me,
[24:32] nor does her mother’s beating affect her.
[24:36] If you talk to her like a friend,
[24:40] then she might understand.
[24:43] Friend?
[24:44] Yes, you become a friend and talk to her.
[24:47] One minute grandma,
[24:49] friend,
[24:51] Maheen’s friend,
[24:53] that lives in her locality.
[24:55] Roshni!
[24:56] Yes, so?
[24:58] She is the one.
[25:05] Her?
[25:19] You have any idea with 
how much difficulty I am calling you,
[25:22] mama has snatched my phone too.
[25:25] I was also thinking that 
you would be in some difficulty.
[25:28] I am not in a difficulty right now,
[25:30] but if you don’t take a step,
 then there will be a difficulty.
[25:35] I will have to handle 
the matters at both ends.
[25:39] My family was upset with me,
[25:42] now your mother is upset with you.
[25:44] You bring the proposal once, Umar.
[25:47] Then I will see how my mother says no.
[25:50] She is my mother, so what, 
will she be the god of my fate too?
[25:58] Hello.
[26:00] Hello.
[26:02] Hello, Umar?
[26:08] I think someone came to him.
[26:25] What will she do?
[26:26] She will hit me more, 
fine she can hit me,
[26:29] she is my mother.
[26:30] Its good, the anger in her 
heart will be taken out.
[26:33] You know there is love
in a mother’s beating even.
[26:37] I will meet her,
[26:38] maybe things will get better.
[26:52] What sort of a mother are you?
[26:53] Don’t you see your daughter’s actions?
[26:55] You have left her free to ruin 
the homes of other people.
[26:59] Lower your voice Zakia,
[27:01] don’t create a scene of me in this locality.
[27:04] Your daughter has created a scene, 
for your respect.
[27:07] If you worried so much,
[27:08] you should have taught us
 how to safeguard respect.
[27:11] Don’t let me open my mouth, Zakia.
[27:13] Monis had doubts earlier,
[27:15] he used to say mama, 
Roshni’s actions don’t seem right,
[27:17] why does she run away to Maheen’s in-laws?
[27:20] I was mad,
[27:21] I used to tell him that she is Maheen’s friend, 
she must go in her love,
[27:24] I didn’t know she went there in his love,
[27:27] she goes to ruin her friend’s home,
 to take her right.
[27:31] Roshni didn’t go,
[27:33] but Maheen used to take my daughter’s 
hand and take her along.
[27:38] I should complain to you,
[27:40] that what your married daughter is
 making my unmarried daughter do.
[27:45] You don’t believe me, right?
[27:46] Wait, let me call her, you ask her yourself.
[27:48] Call her.
[27:49] Call her.
[27:50] Roshni.
[27:53] Roshni.
[27:58] Its useless to argue, mama.
[28:00] I have made my decision.
[28:02] Oh God, Fareed, what is wrong with you?
[28:04] What sort of decisions are you taking?
[28:05] You should have 
at least thought about Maheen.
[28:09] Mama,
[28:10] if Maheen stands up for her right,
[28:12] I will support her too, but…
[28:17] I have made my decision,
[28:20] but I have not told Umar
 about this decision.
[28:25] First I will talk to Maheen for the last time,
[28:28] if she agrees,
[28:32] then I will put this decision 
and condition in front of Umar.
[28:47] I found out everything,
[28:49] she used to do all this in front of you 
and you kept on seeing it.
[28:53] She is your friend, right?
[28:55] What do you want?
[28:57] This is not a movie from the seventies that 
two friends changes their veil and share a man.
[29:04] Sister in law, you don’t know 
the whole thing, you please stop it.
[29:07] What does I not know?
[29:09] What does I not know? Tell me.
[29:12] Its Roshni,
[29:15] hey she used to hit on your husband in front of you,
[29:18] and you kept on seeing it.
[29:18] Because he loves her from before.
[29:21] Before me.
[29:23] Sister in law, he has promised to marry her.
[29:25] To hell with such a promise.
[29:28] Maheen,
[29:29] there is no promise, no statement, 
no dialogue bigger than a wedding.
[29:34] Understand this.
[29:34] Its not,
[29:36] if the wedding is done with your heart, then.
[29:39] But promises, wedding,
[29:45] nothing has any place,
[29:48] just like I have no place in Umar’s life.
[29:57] Uncle is calling me.
[29:58] Maheen.
[31:18] Mama.
[31:19] What are you doing, aunt?
[31:20] Mama. 
Leave me. I will not leave her.
[31:22] Mama…
[31:50] Tell me, what happened?
[31:53] Don’t ask me anything, Monis.
[31:55] You went to Roshni’s home, right?
[31:58] Tell me what did you talk about there.
[32:02] You always had a complaint that I wanted to get 
rid of my daughter from my head as a burden.
[32:10] I still want to see her in her home.
[32:15] A daughter is not a burden,
[32:19] the burden is the thinking 
that the society shows us.
[32:22] Still, tell me, what did they say?
[32:26] Just let me be quiet.
[32:47] I had never thought that
[32:53] I would talk about this to
 my daughter and daughter in law.
[33:01] You can talk about everything
 with your daughter,
[33:04] go ahead.
[33:08] Maheen only two people are 
standing with Umar at this moment,
[33:11] one is me and the other is you.
[33:17] I maybe am supporting him because 
whatever he is saying and doing,
[33:20] because I am responsible for it,
[33:25] and I also because I am scared
 that he will become a rebel.
[33:29] But
[33:32] I don’t know why are you supporting him?
[33:38] But child,
[33:40] I feel hesitant in supporting him.
[33:45] I..I don’t.
[33:50] I don’t want to mistreat you, Maheen.
[33:58] Tell me uncle,
[34:00] what do you want?
[34:03] What is your decision?
[34:08] Heart.
[34:14] My heart says that in every
 decision you will be mistreated,
[34:21] living with Umar and
[34:25] not living with Umar too.
[34:29] So,
[34:33] I give you the right to decide.
[34:37] What do you want uncle?
[34:40] A daughter’s decision easily 
becomes a father’s wish.
[34:48] Child, I want that you always live with us,
[34:52] even if not as a daughter in law, 
but as a daughter.
[34:58] Don’t consider this my selfishness,
[35:04] that I want your support in old age.
[35:09] I don’t want to give Zakia 
another shock, Maheen.
[35:24] So,
[35:27] so, then,
[35:31] then we will decide for Umar.
[35:35] I mean, is me living here your condition?
[35:43] I am not in a position to put 
conditions in front of my son.
[35:54] I have hopes from my daughter,
[35:58] I can talk to her,
[35:59] so I am not putting a condition, 
I am requesting her.
[36:04] Uncle, order.
[36:05] Order me.
[36:07] I don’t want to tie you down, child.
[36:13] Look,
[36:16] if you feel that your life will be wasted,
[36:21] then you have a right
 to speak up about it.
[36:27] But don’t make any decision hastily,
 Zakia, already…
[36:37] Uncle.
[36:39] Uncle,
[36:43] I will live here.
[36:45] I will live here with you,
[36:47] till you want
[36:52] You got me here,
[36:55] when you think its feasible,
[36:58] you can drop me back.
[37:02] Just don’t mention this to Umar.
[37:06] Now if you are satisfied from my side,
[37:14] then also satisfy Umar.
[37:23] Live long.
[37:24] Live happy.
