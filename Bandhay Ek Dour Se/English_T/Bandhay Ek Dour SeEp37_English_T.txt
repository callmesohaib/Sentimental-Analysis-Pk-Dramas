[00:35] Why are you crying now?
[00:42] No.
[00:46] You may hide your tears,
[00:48] but your empty eyes tell everything.
[00:56] Why don’t you say that you love him?
[01:00] How long will you hide it?
[01:03] And from him…
[01:05] if you have to hide it from him,
[01:07] then at least accept it yourself.
[01:09] What acceptance sister in law?
[01:12] I am embarrassed,
[01:15] because I am trying to show
ownership on someone else’s thing.
[01:18] Someone else’s?
[01:20] He is your husband
[01:23] and you should have made him realize this.
[01:26] You don’t make someone realize,
[01:31] one realizes on their own.
[01:33] I realized it.
[01:36] And you don’t even ask for love,
[01:41] you get it.
[01:44] I didn’t get it,
[01:47] Roshni did.
[01:50] No,
[01:53] at times you need to ask for love,
[01:56] just like a prayer.
[01:59] If prayers are made
with intensity and power,
[02:03] they get accepted.
[02:05] Look at me,
[02:08] the doctors said no to me
after seeing all my test results,
[02:11] they told me it won’t happen.
[02:13] But see what happened?
[02:15] God’s blessing won,
[02:18] you too ask for it once.
[02:22] You asked for something
for something that was already yours,
[02:25] how can I ask for someone else’s thing?
[02:30] So will you live all your life with this burden?
[02:33] No,
[02:36] Umar’s love is not a burden on my heart,
[02:41] I am at peace,
[02:42] that to get him,
[02:45] I didn’t had to take support of anything.
[02:48] Neither truth, nor lies.
[02:53] A person can pray to God,
[02:58] but cannot ask for love from a man.
[03:04] This is not something you ask for in charity.
[04:02] Umar.
[04:07] Yes?
[04:13] I want to talk to you
about something important.
[04:17] Go ahead.
[04:35] Speak up Maheen.
[04:36] Its Roshni.
[04:44] I have to tell you that
[04:47] I am shifting downstairs in grandma’s room,
[04:49] this room will be for you and Roshni…
[04:53] Stop it.
[04:55] Stop it. Stop it.
[05:04] What do you want?
[05:08] I asked you, what do you want?
[05:11] How many medals do you
want on your shoulders?
[05:16] What do I do?
[05:19] What do I do?
[05:21] What is your problem?
[05:23] What do I do?
[05:25] I am asking you, what do I do?
[05:30] How much burden will you put on me
because of your favors?
[05:33] Speak up.
[05:36] Speak up.
[06:17] I don’t have a daughter,
[06:20] still my heart is hurting.
[06:23] You always considered her your daughter,
[06:25] then how can you…
[06:30] Uncle,
[06:32] I wanted your permission.
[06:33] Yes, go ahead child.
[06:35] Tell me.
[06:37] Can I go to mama’s home for a day or two.
[06:40] But day after tomorrow…
[06:42] Yes child, surely.
[06:45] Go for a week.
[06:48] You will be able to rest
[06:51] and after all,
[06:55] we are much better now.
[06:57] Don’t worry about this place.
[06:59] Yes…
[07:05] Thank you.
[07:13] After I return,
[07:16] I will shift to grandma’s room.
[07:21] Live… live long.
[07:26] I wanted myself that
she shouldn’t stay here on this occasion.
[07:31] But I didn’t have the courage to say it.
[07:35] Its good,
[07:37] she decided to go herself.
[07:45] Fine.
[07:46] Fine.
[07:48] Fine.
[08:17] How many more medals do you
want on your shoulders?
[08:22] What do I do?
[08:25] what do I do?
[08:27] what is your problem?
[08:29] What do I do?
[08:31] I am asking you what should I do?
[08:36] How much further will you put me 
under the burden of your favors?
[10:52] Why don’t you say that you love him?
[10:56] how long will you hide it?
[10:58] And from him,
[11:00] but even if you hide it from him,
[11:03] accept it yourself.
[14:25] Here you go.
[14:26] Okay sister in law,
[14:27] will meet in a few days.
[14:32] Listen,
[14:34] these few days will become a pain for you,
[14:38] you cannot tolerate it, right?
[14:40] Yes,
[14:42] I cannot tolerate it.
[14:45] I cannot tolerate that 
Umar is in constant guilt because of me.
[14:52] he cannot even be happy with me here.
[14:56] When he looks at me,
[14:58] he just looks embarrassed.
[15:00] He feels that
he cannot do justice with me.
[15:04] at least, at this point in his life
when I am not here,
[15:08] he will be able to celebrate
the happiness of having his love.
[15:15] He will have that feeling.
[15:19] But Maheen, you…
[15:20] Maheen,
[15:22] come on.
[15:24] I have come to get you.
[15:31] Okay sister in law.
[15:33] Maheen, take care of yourself.
[16:38] What is your problem?
[16:40] You are not replying to my messages,
you are not even calling me back.
[16:43] Have you forgotten
that I am your future wife?
[16:45] Huh?
[16:47] What is wrong with you?
[16:49] Everyone is listening.
[16:52] Come to the side.
[16:54] Leave my hand.
[16:55] What is your problem?
[16:59] You need to have manners.
[17:01] Tell me,
[17:03] what do I reply to your messages with?
[17:06] I have nothing to say.
[17:08] How much more time do you want?
[17:10] Huh?
[17:11] How much have
I gone through for you Umar?
[17:14] I have heard the world ridicule me,
my mother’s pressure,
[17:17] seeing you becoming someone else’s,
Maheen’s hatred.
[17:21] I want peace in my future life.
[17:24] I want peace.
[17:27] Roshni, I am trying to keep you happy 
as much as its possible for me.
[17:32] Only for your peace,
I ruin everyone else’s peace?
[17:36] Everyone else’s peace?
[17:39] My life,
[17:40] my compromises,
[17:42] me ruining my life,
[17:43] will I not get anything in return for it?
[17:48] What favors of everyone do I repay?
[17:52] Listen, listen to me calmly,
[17:56] the wedding is day after tomorrow,
[17:58] you have tomorrow,
[18:00] you get the upstairs portion emptied,
I will live with you,
[18:03] I wont live with your mother,
father and grandmother.
[18:06] I have not taken their responsibility.
[18:09] The condition for whom they have
put to live in the home,
[18:12] she should care for them.
[18:20] No Roshni,
[18:22] that is not possible.
[18:25] Umar, listen to me,
[18:27] they depend on you right now,
[18:29] you can make them to agree to anything.
[18:35] Listen to me carefully,
[18:38] if you don’t take a step,
[18:42] then I will have to take
a step out of helplessness.
[18:46] For example. For example, what?
[18:48] For example at the time of the wedding,
[18:51] I will say no to the wedding.
[19:01] This will be your last favor on me.
[19:09] Yes, Roshni,
I will not be able to do this.
[19:15] If you do this,
[19:17] then our difficulty will become easy.
[19:19] Umar…
[19:59] Maheen.
[20:01] Its good you came.
[20:03] Take these things to grandma’s room.
[20:10] What is all this?
[20:12] Things, keep them in grandma’s room.
[20:19] Why are Maheen things going
 to grandma’s room?
[20:21] Umar,
[20:23] both girls can live in your life,
[20:26] but they cannot live in the same room, right?
[20:28] Pick it up.
[20:29] Leave it.
[20:31] You move.
[20:32] Sister in law, come here. Come here.
[20:34] What are you doing?
[20:35] Maheen’s things will not go anywhere. 
Maheen.
[20:38] Maheen.
[20:39] Maheen.
[20:40] She is at her mother’s home.
[20:43] Why is she at her mother’s home?
[20:44] Before she went, 
she asked me to shift her things there.
[20:50] Why did you people let her go?
[20:51] What is wrong with you?
[20:53] You are worrying like she will not come back.
[20:57] After all, her stay here in the days of your 
and Roshni’s wedding is not right.
[21:02] She will feel less pain
[21:05] and she also says that 
when she is not here,
[21:08] you will have lesser guilt.
[21:12] Pick it up.
[21:13] Leave it.
[25:22] What I couldn’t say to him, 
I can say to myself.
[25:26] I can accept it myself,
[25:29] even after not wanting to,
[25:31] I have started to love him.
[25:33] I don’t know when, how.
[25:37] I didn’t realize when Umar became 
the most important for me.
[26:00] I know he doesn’t love me, but Roshni.
[26:05] But I cannot stop him from wishing,
[26:10] I cannot stop him from loving.
[26:13] I will accept another thing today,
[26:16] that a lot of times have come 
when my heart became selfish
[26:22] and thought that I tell him some realities 
knowing which he would only be mine.
[26:29] But I couldn’t be this selfish.
[26:33] Not because my conscience didn’t let me,
[26:36] but only because you 
need love in return of love.
[26:41] When his love is not in my fate,
[26:44] what will I do with him being with me?
[27:01] There was a time,
[27:02] when I felt that telling you about Roshni,
[27:06] I would break your heart,
[27:08] now I myself know that you find out
[27:12] that she has changed her way a long time back,
[27:15] because the sorrow of breaking a heart
 is much more than having your heart broken,
[27:20] that too for someone 
who has been made of love like you.
[27:24] Today, you should know 
that both of us were helpless,
[27:28] but Roshni,
[27:30] Roshni had changed her way by her will,
[27:33] by liking someone else.
[28:55] How are you Monis?
[28:57] What did you come here for, Umar?
[29:02] I came to get Maheen.
[29:05] I will not send her there now.
[29:10] Its not about you sending her,
[29:13] nor is it about me taking her.
[29:17] The thing is if Maheen wants to come along or not,
[29:24] she has to decide.
[29:25] No,
[29:27] she is making this decision under pressure 
and out of helplessness.
[29:31] And the allegation Roshni has put on her,
[29:34] out of the fear of it being proven true,
[29:36] she will sit in a corner of your home, 
useless, and ruin her whole life.
[29:41] So I will not let her make this decision.
[29:44] One minute,
[29:46] what allegation did Roshni put on her?
[29:49] Like you know nothing.
[29:50] No, Monis.
[29:52] Roshni has put the allegation that
 Maheen likes someone else,
[29:57] and she is doing all this so that her path…
[30:00] damn such a liar!
[30:09] Thank you Roshni.
[30:11] What nonsense is this?
[30:15] Trust me Monis, one by one all 
the burdens have been removed,
[30:21] everything is clear.
[30:24] Roshni is right,
[30:27] she really loves someone,
[30:29] she loves me,
[30:31] she loves me a lot.
[30:51] Don’t worry Monis,
[30:54] everything will be alright.
[31:08] Yes mama, I am coming to get you.
[31:11] Yes.
[31:31] Roshni,
[31:32] Roshni, what are you doing?
[31:34] Listen to me.
[31:36] You have a misunderstanding, 
why would I do this?
[31:38] If you don’t want to take away Umar from me,
 then who will do it?
[31:41] If I had to take Umar away from you, 
I would have done it a million times earlier,
[31:46] I had a lot of chances,
[31:47] I would have told her the truth, 
that you got tired of him a long time back,
[31:50] you told me to tell him to leave you alone.
[31:54] I could have told him the truth that
[31:56] you were dreaming of marrying 
someone at the time of our wedding.
[31:59] In fact, I could even tell him 
when your mother told me herself
[32:03] that you were dying to 
marry your cousin, Roshni.
[32:06] You went to Lahore yourself,
 and came back only when you were disappointed.
[32:09] But I didn’t tell anything, Roshni. Nothing.
[32:12] Only because, no one could say in my life 
that I tried to take him away from you
[32:18] or by telling the truth, or by lying, 
or by any way possible.
[32:21] You did good that 
you didn’t tell him anything,
[32:24] that he was so mad in my love, 
he was so stupid,
[32:27] that even if you would have spoken the truth,
 he would have considered it a lie.
[32:31] What do you think?
[32:31] Umar is really innocent,
[32:33] Umar messaged and 
called me after marriage,
[32:35] he promised to marry me, 
and married you.
[32:37] And Maheen you, 
you didn’t live up to our friendship.
[32:40] You married the man I loved, 
you people cheated me too.
[32:45] If I thought for myself, 
what wrong did I do?
[33:14] Umar, are you mad?
[33:18] Not mad.
[33:24] I am free.
[33:29] I had decided before coming here,
[33:34] but there was a sadness in my heart,
[33:40] I might have had some guilt that 
maybe I am cheating someone.
[33:52] But,
[33:54] I…
[33:58] I feel a burden has been lifted off me,
[34:04] a huge burden.
[34:17] You go from here.
[34:20] You too are free, go.
[34:24] Did you not hear me?
[34:27] I told you to leave from here!
[34:29] Umar.
[34:31] Umar, what has happened to you? 
What has happened?
[34:34] Move back.
[34:37] I have to sit and talk to my wife, alone.
[34:41] I don’t want a third
 person to come between us.
[34:46] Third person?
[34:47] We were together,
 she is the third person!
[34:53] Maheen, come home.
[35:00] The whole family knows 
I have come to get you.
[35:02] Come on.
[35:03] Leave her hand.
[35:05] You cannot do this with me, and she?
[35:07] She is the reason behind all this, 
I will not leave him.
[35:09] leave me. leave me.
[35:11] Roshni, you have gone mad. Umar.
[35:16] She is my wife.
[35:19] Do you hear that?
[35:22] Get out!
[35:26] I knew it.
[35:28] I knew you would cheat me again,
[35:30] you promised to marry me,
 and you married her.
[35:33] I got fooled by you again,
[35:35] but Umar I will not let you 
cheat me this time.
[35:37] I will not leave her.
[35:39] Yes, I am cheating.
[35:40] I am cheating!
[35:42] But I am not cheating you,
 I am cheating myself.
[35:44] Because I loved Maheen, not you!
[35:51] Your reality just came in front of me,
[35:57] you had bad intentions from day one.
[36:03] But I was a fool,
[36:06] who used to think something else.
[36:11] Get lost from here.
[36:14] Get out!
[36:15] Get out, Roshni.
[36:16] Get out.
[36:17] Get out.
[36:19] Umar.
[36:19] Get out. Get out.
[36:50] Sorry.
[37:44] You know,
[37:46] this is what I wanted.
[37:49] If you come back to me,
[37:52] then you should come 
because of your heart,
[37:55] because of love,
[37:59] and that you don’t come to me 
disappointed with a broken heart.
[38:16] You said it yourself,
[38:19] that there is no this 
and also that in love.
[38:25] In love it’s either this or that.
