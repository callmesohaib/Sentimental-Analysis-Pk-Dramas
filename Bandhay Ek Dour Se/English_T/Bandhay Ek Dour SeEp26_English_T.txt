[00:20] I have to go there daily, I am helpless.
[00:22] And when I go there,
I have to get embarrassed daily
[00:24] and look at her stubbornness.
[00:27] Brother was asking even today,
won’t Maheen come to see me?
[00:32] Mama,
[00:34] why does Roshni go there every second day?
[00:38] Was she there today too?
[00:39] I see her daily.
[00:44] Why does she go there?
[00:48] I am asking you something.
[00:49] I don’t know.
[00:51] You ask her.
[00:53] She must go because of her,
[00:55] the tears in her eyes have dried.
[00:57] I am telling you Monis,
her actions are not those of fixing her home.
[00:59] But I need an answer to my questions.
[01:01] Okay. Stop.
[01:02] What reason?
[01:02] What relation does she go there with?
[01:04] Being Maheen’s friend?
[01:05] But she doesn’t consider them their own.
[01:07] she doesn’t participate in their pain and sorrow,
[01:10] but why is Roshni always there in place of Maheen,
[01:12] I want to know this.
[01:13] Okay, come on. Stop now.
[01:15] Come on.
[01:30] You eat really little,
[01:32] okay bring it fast man.
[01:34] I am seeing you so happy
and relaxed after so many days.
[01:38] Yes,
[01:40] mama will come home from the hospital.
[01:43] Thank God.
[01:44] Papa will be home in a few days too.
[01:48] Roshni,
[01:50] you have really supported me in these days.
[01:54] You were my support.
[01:56] Thank you.
[01:59] You know,
[02:01] your mother spoke with me with so much love,
[02:04] for the first time.
[02:06] Really?
[02:06] Earlier, she considered me Maheen’s friend,
she didn’t give me much importance.
[02:11] But then she started talking to me so lovingly.
[02:16] You know I have made your work easy.
[02:20] What work?
[02:21] Hey,
[02:23] now if you talk about me at your home,
[02:25] then you will not have to convince them a lot,
[02:28] because they have started to
like me a little from the start.
[02:35] Yes, but
[02:39] it won’t be right to talk about
this in the current situation. Right?
[02:43] Hey, this is the right time.
[02:46] When you spoke to them earlier
about the second wedding,
[02:49] that was the wrong time,
[02:50] this is the right time.
[02:52] You talk about it again, please.
[03:02] I am really happy.
[03:09] Najia.
[03:10] Hey, coming.
[03:12] Najia.
[03:13] Come on.
[03:14] Careful. Careful. Careful.
[03:15] Hello mama.
[03:17] Hello.
[03:17] Take her. Take her. Take her to the bed.
[03:19] Careful.
[03:23] Thank God.
[03:25] Come mama.
[03:25] Walk slowly. Slowly.
[03:28] Hey, I am also not used to this.
[03:31] No practice.
[03:32] Hold this.
[03:34] Hold my hand.
[03:35] Careful child. Careful.
[03:37] Give it to me. give it.
[03:38] Thank God.
[03:44] Take this Mansoor,
[03:46] give this to someone.
[03:47] Yes.
[03:48] Put a pillow under my leg.
[03:49] I will keep it.
[03:53] The big one, keep this.
[03:59] Keep it.
[04:03] That’s it. That’s it. No. remove it.
[04:09] Thank God I am back to my home.
[04:13] Are you happy now?
[04:15] You are back home after so many days,
[04:17] God has given you a new life.
[04:20] I will be happy the day their father comes home.
[04:26] May God just give him health soon.
[04:30] By the will of God, papa will be
with us in two to four days.
[04:34] By the will of God.
[04:35] By the will of God. By the will of God.
[04:45] Hey,
[04:47] are you people this happy on me coming back
or is there another reason for the happiness?
[04:53] No, no mama,
[04:54] we are really happy that you are back,
[04:57] and…
[04:59] Hey, when Mansoor tells you,
[05:02] when he gives you the good news,
you will get real happiness.
[05:06] Mama,
[05:09] God has answered your prayers.
[05:13] Your wish is fulfilled.
[05:16] Najia is pregnant.
[05:18] What?
[05:20] What are you saying?
[05:22] Oh God, thank you.
[05:25] How do I thank God?
[05:28] Hey Najia, come here.
[05:30] Go.
[05:33] Congratulations to you child.
[05:38] What are you doing standing there?
[05:39] Go get sweets,
I will distribute them to the locality…
[05:43] in fact, I will distribute it to the whole family.
[05:45] Go get it.
[05:46] No. no. no. no.
[05:49] No need to spread the word,
[05:51] first child is always hard,
after two or two and a half months pass,
[05:57] then you can tell everyone, not right now.
[06:00] Fine mama. Fine.
[06:02] Mama, this is the fruit of your
and grandma’s prayers,
[06:06] when we were even disappointed with the doctor,
[06:10] God showered his blessings suddenly.
[06:13] Come here. Come here.
[06:15] Yes.
[06:36] Hear me out, please.
[06:40] I don’t want to hear anything.
[06:41] if you want to talk to me about anything,
send the proposal tonight, that is it.
[06:45] Come on.
[06:46] I am coming.
[06:49] Hey, Monis.
[06:50] Listen,
[06:52] the thing is that Maheen is already home.
[06:56] Now in this situation mama cannot go to her in-laws
where recently they had an accident and tell them
[07:03] that we are going to fix the date of Monis’ wedding.
[07:05] But Monis, what does sister Maheen want?
[07:08] Does she want to live 
at her in-laws house all her life?
[07:11] If you want I can talk to her.
[07:13] No Fazeela, you won’t do that.
[07:15] The thing is that
[07:17] I don’t Maheen to think even for a moment that
because of her there are issues in our life.
[07:24] but issues are there.
[07:25] You know even today aunt is
coming to talk to mama,
[07:28] what do you want Monis?
[07:30] Don’t I have a family?
Do I not have to face anyone?
[07:32] After all, how do I tolerate all this?
[07:34] Okay, fine, you don’t worry,
[07:36] I will talk to mama today.
[07:38] I don’t worry,
[07:39] I don’t get tensed.
[07:41] Maheen is my friend,
[07:43] my wedding is getting postponed because of her,
[07:45] how can she do this with me?
[07:47] You please make her understand,
not to do this with me.
[07:50] We will find out a solution.
[07:55] Okay,
[07:56] smile a little we are sitting together.
[08:04] Just a little bit.
[08:06] I will talk to mama today.
[08:10] Drive fast friend.
[08:16] I have been in the hospital for nine days,
[08:20] you have been to work and in the hospital only,
[08:23] you have not rested for a moment.
[08:26] The rest I am getting from caring for you,
[08:30] I can never get rest like that ever.
[08:35] A child like you is a blessing.
[08:41] Its just that parents make a mistake in
understanding and seeing the child.
[08:50] I feel embarrassed now that
[08:53] I used to consider you so careless and someone
who would run away from responsibility.
[08:57] What are you saying papa?
[09:02] I am the one who is embarrassed.
[09:07] I have bothered you people for no reason,
[09:11] forgive me.
[09:12] The worry I see on your face,
what is the reason for that?
[09:19] Its all because of my one sided decisions.
[09:25] I now realize that
[09:29] children are not like blank cheques
that you cash them when you want.
[09:41] God has given me a second life so that
[09:49] I fix my mistakes.
[09:58] Look mama, Fazeela is not wrong,
[10:00] her sister has made
all preparations for the wedding
[10:03] and her family calls her mother daily
to ask about the wedding date.
[10:06] Look Monis, 
I am really worried because of Maheen,
[10:10] how do I tell your paternal family
that I am fixing your wedding date.
[10:14] They already knew that
I would get married this year,
[10:17] then what is the issue?
[10:19] Maheen.
[10:21] The issue is Maheen
coming home and sitting here
[10:23] and your aunt and uncle are bed ridden.
[10:26] Son, try and understand the sensitivity of time.
[10:29] Hey, no need to do anything lavishly,
[10:32] we will do it with simplicity.
[10:34] We have an excuse that
because of aunt and uncle’s health,
[10:37] the whole plan has gone down the drain.
[10:40] Wow, you two thought of everything,
[10:43] you have planned everything,
[10:45] you just didn’t think of Maheen.
[10:46] Hey, I will talk to Maheen,
[10:48] if she doesn’t want to go home,
[10:50] then she can stay here till my wedding
[10:52] and create a drama of being Umar’s good wife,
[10:55] like she was doing earlier.
[10:57] Damn you,
[10:58] why would she have to do a drama?
[11:01] I will convince her.
[11:02] She is not bad at heart,
[11:04] she is like your father,
[11:06] stubborn but she has a realization inside her.
[11:12] Okay,
[11:14] fine.
[11:15] Go tell them
[11:16] that we will come to get the date this week.
[11:40] Look Monis,
I am really worried because of Maheen,
[11:44] how do I tell your paternal family
that I am fixing your wedding date.
[11:48] They already knew that
I would get married this year,
[11:51] then what is the issue?
[11:52] Maheen.
[11:53] The issue is Maheen coming home and sitting here
and your aunt and uncle are bed ridden.
[12:01] Son, try and understand the sensitivity of time.
[12:17] Maheen.
[12:20] Maheen.
[12:30] You are not ready?
[12:32] You won’t go?
[12:35] Come along Maheen,
[12:36] Razia has been discharged from the hospital,
[12:39] the whole family will come to meet her.
[12:41] If they find out you are not there,
they will talk a lot.
[12:45] They all know from the beginning,
[12:47] those who don’t know,
[12:49] you tell them.
[12:51] You just come to ask about her health,
[12:53] I will not leave you there.
[12:57] When the relation is over, then why do I ask?
[13:01] Then sit here!
[13:03] Your eyes no longer have shame,
[13:05] I don’t know what’s up with you.
[13:07] God knows what girls tolerate at their in-laws,
[13:09] look at me,
[13:10] have I faced less?
[13:11] And that Najia,
[13:13] Razia is so strict with her,
[13:15] but someone like Najia,
[13:18] at this time even she is receiving praises from
the world caring for the mother and daughter in law.
[13:20] But you sit,
[13:22] you don’t go,
[13:23] but I will have to go,
[13:25] I will also have to face everyone’s sarcasm,
[13:27] they will question me how I brought you up.
[13:39] Why is Zakia coming now?
[13:43] Monis called.
[13:46] I thought I would tell you.
[13:48] Tell Monis,
[13:49] not to do these dramas,
[13:52] if they have the girl sitting at their home,
[13:54] then she should stay at home.
[13:56] Yes and no need to come and ask how I am.
[14:01] I cannot say all this to them,
[14:04] you say it yourself.
[14:05] Yes, why would you say it?
[14:07] You are obedient to your mother in law.
[14:12] My son has been so low.
[14:15] He doesn’t laugh, nor smile,
[14:18] if Zakia is not worthy enough
 to take away his worries,
[14:21] then tell her that there is no need
to get blessings by inquiring about me.
[14:27] Let her come today,
[14:30] you will see how I talk to her clearly.
[14:37] Maheen, you should have gone with them,
[14:40] you too have relations from that home.
[14:44] I know aunt
[14:46] and I know the worth of those relations
and I also respect them in my heart
[14:50] but right now I know what relation
everyone wants me to save.
[14:57] So what is wrong in that?
[14:59] Look, there is still a chance to make truce,
[15:02] that won’t be there in future.
[15:04] Learn to respect relations.
[15:07] Now see my Roshni,
[15:09] what does she lack?
[15:12] She is twenty two years old,
[15:13] but still there are no proposals.
[15:18] She will get proposals aunt.
[15:20] Anyway, there was a little hope that
was created with one of our relatives,
[15:25] you know them,
[15:26] Shahista and her son.
[15:29] But she got hurt so badly from there,
[15:32] that she is still sad.
[15:37] Sad?
[15:40] She said no herself, right?
[15:44] She would have said no,
if they had sent the proposal,
[15:47] They misbehaved with us a lot
[15:50] they insulted us so badly.
[15:52] Look at my Roshni,
[15:53] she had such dreams and hopes
that is why I say respect relations.
[15:58] My Roshni even went to their home and
in the end what did they turn out to be?
[16:04] Meaning they had not sent a proposal?
[16:10] And you were not pressurizing Roshni to accept it?
[16:13] She didn’t say no herself?
[16:17] Oh God,
[16:20] meaning Roshni told you nothing.
[16:25] I thought you were close friends,
[16:28] she would tell you everything before me.
[16:33] Look Maheen,
[16:34] don’t mention anything to Roshni,
that I told you everything.
[16:39] Look she will fight a lot with me,
[16:42] I will get disrespected badly.
[16:45] No,
[16:47] rest assured aunt,
[16:51] I won’t tell her anything.
[16:53] You have these snacks.
[16:55] Leave this.
[16:56] Look Maheen,
[16:58] you are saying the truth, right?
You won’t tell her anything, right?
[17:00] Look Maheen, if you tell Roshni,
[17:04] she will fight and
stay locked in her room for days,
[17:07] oh God this is a big problem.
[17:09] You know, God guide you girls.
[17:12] Both of you.
[17:14] One doesn’t get married and the other doesn’t know
how to live in a relation after getting married.
[17:19] Don’t worry aunt.
[17:24] Yes.
[17:27] I am really worried.
[17:36] Damn it,
[17:37] you have no shame,
no manners, you came alone.
[17:40] You cannot control a girl.
[17:42] Mama, she is not agreeing,
[17:44] she is being stubborn, what could I do?
[17:46] I cannot force her.
[17:49] Look at that,
[17:50] if Umar had said something like that,
[17:53] everyone would have beaten him up so much
that he would have straightened up.
[17:59] You cannot control a girl.
[18:01] You know I cannot agree
that Maheen did all this,
[18:05] you must have instigated her.
[18:07] What are you saying mama?
[18:08] What mother wouldn’t want her
daughter to stay at her home?
[18:12] Yes, a mother like you.
[18:17] Tell me, tell me sister in law,
[18:18] did Maheen ever talk to you badly
or argue with you?
[18:22] She always respects everyone.
[18:26] That is what we are crying about.
[18:29] we were good to her, she was good to us,
[18:32] then what got into her head?
[18:36] If she has a complain with Umar, then tell us.
[18:39] Whoever is at fault, we will ask,
regardless if its our own son.
[18:43] But she forgot all manners.
[18:45] Umar cannot be at fault, I can tell you this.
[18:50] But mama people are saying
[18:52] that God knows how Umar
and us have tormented this girl
[18:57] that she is not agreeing to
come here from her mother’s home.
[19:03] You know Zakia,
people are pointing fingers at our son,
[19:06] that God forbid, 
maybe he has the fault.
[19:10] We got stuck after doing a good deed.
[21:25] My son seems so low these days,
[21:28] from the hospital to home 
and from home to the hospital,
[21:31] he didn’t get any peace getting married.
[21:34] Is this how wives are?
[21:36] Wives support the husband
 in happiness and sorrow.
[21:40] He married on his parents’ will 
and this is what he got in return.
[21:44] Live long, stay happy.
[21:46] Mama just gave me the good news,
[21:48] may God bring that time safely, 
may you have happiness in your lap.
[21:51] Thank you aunt.
[21:53] The doctor asked her to rest,
[21:56] but she doesn’t have rest in her fate.
[21:58] She is doing her work and mine too.
[22:01] The one who is supposed to care for this home, 
we don’t know about her.
[22:04] Mama, stop it, 
the doctor has told you not to,
[22:08] why are you getting worried.
[22:12] May God not make anyone handicapped, 
may he not make them bed ridden.
[22:16] Oh God, how are you handicapped,
[22:19] may God protect you, pray for good.
[22:24] Mama, being handicapped is the same,
[22:27] whether its for a year, or for a few months.
[22:31] I cannot get off the bed,
[22:33] I am dependent on Najia 
to go to the bathroom even
[22:37] and is she in the condition 
to take care of all this?
[22:42] After so many prayers, after so long,
[22:44] God showed us this day.
[22:46] If God forbid, something goes wrong, 
who will be responsible then?
[22:54] Stop it now. Stop.
[22:57] Don’t worry.
[23:02] You shouldn’t have got aunt here in this condition.
[23:06] She has to hear so much,
[23:10] although I know well that 
aunt has no fault in this.
[23:14] Then whose fault is it Umar?
[23:16] At least you tell me 
the reason for all this issue,
[23:19] Maheen won’t tell us anything apart from the fact 
that she doesn’t want to live with you.
[23:25] So is this reason not enough?
[23:33] What do you want?
[23:38] Monis,
[23:40] I cannot force anyone to stay with me.
[23:45] when she cannot tolerate my existence,
[23:48] she hates me so much,
[23:50] then how can I myself…
[24:45] Okay I will leave then.
[24:56] Hello.
[25:08] Hello aunt.
[25:17] If you had to come, 
you could have come with us.
[25:21] You were leaving 
and I had to do my packing.
[25:27] Hello grandma.
[25:33] How are you now, aunt?
[25:40] You are going?
[25:42] Yes, but if you want, I can stay…
[25:46] No, no.
[25:47] let me keep my things.
[26:05] I will leave then, it will get really late.
[26:27] Its good that you came back to your home, Maheen.
[26:31] Do we make diet food for aunt?
[26:34] You leave it, I will make it.
[26:35] You just came, I will make it.
[26:37] You were just saying this is my own home
 and then what is the formality?
[26:42] I will make it, you rest.
[26:47] Can I ask you something?
[26:50] Go ahead.
[26:51] Mama and papa’s health,
[26:53] aunt or family pressure is what brought you back
 or you came with your heart.
[27:00] There can be a third reason as well.
[27:03] What is that?
[27:06] I have come back,
[27:08] that’s enough.
[27:12] If you have come back forever, 
and we are satisfied, then that is enough.
[27:24] Did someone come between you and Umar?
[28:36] Yes Najia.
[28:37] Mansoor, Maheen is back.
[28:40] What?
[28:41] Maheen is back?
[28:43] Did she come herself?
[28:44] Yes,
[28:45] you do one thing, 
give this good news to papa in the hospital.
[28:48] No, I am telling anyone anything,
[28:51] You tell me, where is Umar?
[28:53] How is he?
[28:54] I don’t know,
[28:55] he must be hiding somewhere,
 after all she came herself.
[28:58] You do one thing, call Umar 
and ask him where he is.
[29:01] Okay, okay, 
I will come home and talk.
[29:04] Listen Najia, 
I am trying to make you understand,
[29:06] that you don’t need to say anything to Maheen.
[29:10] I don’t know what is going on each of their heads,
[29:13] we will get stuck in between those two.
[29:15] Hey, why would I talk?
[29:17] I don’t have this habit.
[29:19] But there is one thing,
[29:20] Maheen should get some credit,
[29:22] she is really smart,
[29:23] she went herself, she came back herself,
[29:25] and she is roaming around in
 the home like nothing happened.
[29:28] Hey, you women can do anything,
 at any time.
[29:32] I have not doubted 
the intelligence of you women.
[29:34] Anyway, I will put the phone down,
 I will come home and talk.
[29:37] Okay.
[29:52] I know you don’t like tasteless food,
[29:56] and definitely not porridge,
[29:57] but the doctor has said that 
you will have to have diet food for a few days.
[30:02] Its gotten cold.
[30:05] My hands are fine,
[30:07] I can eat myself.
[30:11] Do you have no shame?
[30:15] No apology, no embarrassment,
[30:17] you are going around like nothing happened.
[30:21] I am embarrassed grandma,
[30:24] I am not apologizing because 
I know you will forgive me when you want.
[30:32] Why make place in someone’s
 heart by asking them.
[30:39] Please do eat this too.
[30:45] Sore oranges with hot porridge,
[30:49] my jaw will fall off.
[31:13] Are you going to the hospital?
[31:16] To meet uncle.
[31:19] Yes.
[31:20] I made food for him,
[31:25] I will also come along.
[31:29] Why?
[31:31] Because I have to meet uncle,
[31:32] ask him how he is.
[31:35] Really?
[31:37] You know he had given up 
hope of your return.
[31:41] He asked about you a lot,
[31:43] so no need to do this favor on him now.
[31:49] I have to apologize to him too.
[31:53] That’s what you came here to say?
[31:57] You know, you didn’t have a
good excuse to leave from here,
[32:00] you didn’t even tell anyone,
[32:01] apart from you disliking being with me.
[32:04] Now have you thought of 
a good excuse to come back?
[32:07] Or the way you suddenly
 didn’t like being with me,
[32:11] you like being with me.
[32:13] I just left, because I feared that 
no one in this home needed me,
[32:18] but its evident that everyone needs me,
[32:21] so I came back.
[32:23] No,
[32:25] I still don’t need you.
[32:27] I know and I also know that you have freed me
 from all your rights and duties.
[32:34] But with regards to everyone else,
 I have some duties,
[32:37] I have come to live up to those 
and you cannot stop me from that.
[32:42] You realized this really soon.
[32:44] I realized it, Umar.
[32:47] You just need to realize
[32:49] and that is enough,
[32:52] even if you realize it later.
[33:42] Mama, earlier you were worried that 
she has come to stay at her mother’s home,
[33:46] now that she has left you are sitting here crying.
[33:50] I am crying thinking what 
she must be going through there.
[33:54] I have seen Razia and mama’s manners,
[33:58] they have poison in their 
hearts for me and Maheen.
[34:02] They will not be at peace 
till they spit out the poison.
[34:06] My daughter, she is so sensitive already, 
what must she be going through.
[34:11] Hey, she must have thought
 about something and went.
[34:13] After all, aunt and uncle were
 angry on her not coming back,
[34:16] now that she has gone back,
 the anger will go.
[34:19] It won’t go like that,
[34:21] till the time they don’t
 destroy her with their taunts,
[34:26] their anger will not go.
[34:28] Brother is still not home,
he is still in the hospital.
[34:33] If he was home he would have made 
the environment of the home worth living in.
[34:38] What will my daughter do, 
she is all alone with her in-laws?
[34:42] She is not alone,
[34:44] Umar is there with her.
[34:56] Maheen, stop child,
[34:59] daughters don’t look good apologizing.
[35:03] Uncle, are you upset with me?
[35:08] No, not at all.
[35:13] Umar, see how she is losing it by crying like this.
[35:15] Get her water.
[35:20] Uncle, you please come home quickly, please.
[35:24] Yes, my daughter is home now,
[35:27] I will come home soon.
[35:30] Right Umar?
[35:39] Maheen, don’t worry child,
[35:43] life is really long, okay?
[35:48] Everything will be fine.
[35:51] Show me how you smile.
[35:57] Well done.
[36:17] Umar.
[36:20] Listen, you go to sleep,
[36:22] this is not the time to walk on the roof,
[36:27] you have to wake up in the morning
 and go to the hospital and also to work.
[36:32] I know,
[36:35] but I cannot sleep here now.
[36:39] I am going to aunt’s room anyway.
[36:41] When did I say that 
I cannot sleep here because of you.
[36:46] It doesn’t matter to me 
whether you go from here or not.
[36:53] Did you hear me, it doesn’t matter to me.
[36:57] That is really good,
[37:00] because aunt needs me right now, 
so I will sleep there for a few days.
[37:05] Listen.
[37:09] What?
[37:11] Nothing Maheen.
[37:15] Go!
