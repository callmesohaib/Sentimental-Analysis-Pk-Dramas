[00:21] Come.
[00:26] Sit down.
[00:32] Okay, tell me now,
[00:34] what do you want to do?
[00:35] why do you want to hold his collar?
[00:37] I am your brother,
[00:39] I will take revenge for
the mistreatment you received.
[00:44] Why did he do all this with you?
[00:46] He did it?
[00:48] Think about it.
[00:51] Brother, did he come to you with a proposal?
[00:55] Or did he tell you and mama
that he will keep me happy.
[00:58] But this wedding was with his will,
he should have said no.
[01:00] Yes,
[01:01] this is his mistake,
[01:03] I accept and even he will accept.
[01:09] Then?
[01:10] Whatever he is doing with Roshni,
[01:12] everyone should be told about this,
he should have a little ashamed.
[01:15] Fine,
[01:16] we will embarrass him,
[01:19] then?
[01:21] Then what?
[01:23] Then what brother?
[01:25] If you embarrass him in front of everyone,
[01:30] will he start liking me instead of Roshni
[01:33] and if uncle and aunt are strict with him,
[01:38] then he will gain respect for me in his heart?
[01:40] So I be quiet like you?
[01:42] I don’t take revenge for the mistreatment you go.
[01:44] No, do it.
[01:48] But tell me, what will this achieve?
[01:55] You know something,
[01:57] if I want,
[02:00] I can force Umar to hate Roshni.
[02:08] But I don’t want to do that.
[02:10] But why Maheen? Why?
[02:12] Because this will not achieve anything brother.
[02:15] Hating Roshni doesn’t mean that…
[02:28] that he will start loving me.
[02:41] Even if I take out Roshni from his heart,
[02:45] there will be an empty space in his heart,
[02:48] and its not necessary that I will get that place.
[02:56] You don’t go Maheen,
[02:58] this home is for you,
[03:02] don’t go to the man
who doesn’t know your worth.
[03:05] I will have to go brother,
[03:08] for aunt,
[03:09] for grandma,
[03:11] for my uncle.
[03:13] I will go there and live as their child.
[03:18] Brother, I have left everything up to God.
[03:25] Listen to me,
[03:30] let what is happening, happen.
[03:35] Someone has to return,
[03:38] now the time will tell if it will be me, or Umar.
[03:45] So leave it.
[03:50] My lovely brother.
[03:53] I cannot tolerate it any further.
[03:55] No,
[03:57] leave it God.
[03:59] Come on sit.
[04:00] We won’t go to mama like this.
[04:41] Thank God you came.
[04:47] Why do you call me again and again?
[04:51] Can you live without me?
[04:53] You can,
[04:56] so live.
[04:57] Not at all.
[05:01] Roshni, life without you is no life.
[05:04] You know well,
I cannot live without you.
[05:07] I love you.
[05:10] Maheen is back,
[05:12] so what is the problem now?
[05:15] She didn’t come for me,
[05:18] she doesn’t love me at all, in fact,
[05:20] maybe she dislikes me.
[05:24] She really loves my family,
she returned for them.
[05:31] Forever?
[05:37] I mean,
[05:42] Umar for you and Maheen,
[05:46] I did all that I could,
[05:48] I had even decided to leave your life,
[05:52] but you didn’t let me leave.
[05:56] Then when Maheen left,
[06:00] without thinking or understanding anything,
I said so much about your family,
[06:06] because I knew Maheen wouldn’t
be able to do all this herself.
[06:11] Now she is back…
[06:15] I don’t know.
[06:19] But still,
[06:22] I will do what you tell me to.
[06:34] Roshni,
[06:37] just a little more wait.
[06:40] I will talk to papa this time.
[06:44] Will your father agree?
[06:48] I will think about this later
whether he agrees or not,
[06:53] right now I just have to talk him right now.
[06:57] Umar, I am scared,
[07:00] you will fall weak in your parents
and Maheen’s pressure.
[07:03] I know, this will happen.
[07:28] Hello uncle.
[07:29] Hello, is Zakia fine?
[07:34] Yes, she is absolutely fine.
[07:37] Monis went from outside,
without meeting me.
[07:43] He had to go to do some important work,
[07:46] he will come next time.
[07:49] I wanted to talk to you, child.
[07:52] Yes?
[07:56] Saying something like this to the daughter
and daughter in law is weird,
[08:02] but there is no other way
to clear the situation,
[08:06] so without any delay,
I am asking you,
[08:12] is there a girl in Umar’s life?
[08:23] What was the need to say all this?
[08:25] Papa asked and I told him.
[08:28] Yes, it was your duty to tell him the whole story.
[08:34] God knows what will happen
to poor Umar after this.
[08:37] He is the only poor one,
[08:39] even after doing everything.
[08:41] He has an innocent girl at home,
[08:43] and he is having an affair.
[08:45] Hey Najia, that is another matter.
[08:48] Look there can be another reason
for Maheen leaving the home too,
[08:52] or else she would have told everyone clearly
that there is someone else in Umar’s life.
[08:57] But did you forget what she said?
[08:59] What excuses she made for not coming here.
[09:05] We don’t know the real thing,
[09:07] its possible that
Umar doesn’t even meet that girl,
[09:11] there can be another reason for their distances.
[09:14] Yes fine,
[09:15] papa will find out the real thing himself.
[09:17] You don’t worry.
[09:35] See,
[09:37] you have fallen weak already,
[09:40] here I just mentioned Maheen,
[09:43] all your courage,
[09:46] all your strength,
[09:47] gave up.
[09:49] Its not that,
but I have to think for her too.
[09:52] For her too?
[09:53] I mean, I have to think about her too.
[09:57] She doesn’t care that I like you,
I love you,
[10:01] nor is she upset on this,
she has never expressed it.
[10:05] But when this things comes in
the open in front of everyone,
[10:07] then I will have to face a thousand questions.
[10:13] I have to answer to everyone, so if I don’t think,
then what will I do?
[10:16] she went to her mother’s home for a few days
and I have to hear so much from aunt
[10:20] and then mama,
I have to think about her too.
[10:28] Its possible mama and
papa will respect my wish,
[10:31] listen to me,
[10:34] but they will not let anything
wrong happen with Maheen,
[10:37] so I have to think about all this.
[10:40] I swear,
[10:42] trust me Roshni,
[10:44] this time I will talk to mama
and papa to go to your home
[10:49] and ask for your proposal
[10:50] and they will have to go.
[10:53] Just a little more wait.
[11:13] Speak up, Maheen.
[11:15] I know the truth,
[11:19] I just want you to verify.
[11:29] Did Umar tell you?
[11:38] Oh, so it is the truth.
[11:41] Right?
[11:43] Umar doesn’t have the moral courage to tell me,
[11:48] I am surprised how he told you.
[11:53] With what heart did he break
this mountain on your head.
[12:03] I know it from the start,
[12:07] before the wedding.
[12:15] Look child,
[12:18] I am equally embarrassed to Umar 
as I am with you.
[12:25] If you have been mistreated then
Umar’s fault is less, my fault is more.
[12:34] Don’t say that.
[12:37] Child, trust me,
[12:40] I didn’t have such an intention.
[12:43] If I had known about Umar,
I wouldn’t have let this moment come,
[12:48] neither would you have gone through this test,
you have been through so much.
[12:56] Nothing like that,
[12:58] I am really happy.
[13:04] How can someone stay happy in such a situation.
[13:10] Not you, not Umar, nor anyone of us.
[13:16] We now just have to decide that
[13:21] one of you gets your happiness.
[13:27] But who?
[13:35] I don’t understand.
[13:39] It’s a big test Maheen.
[13:43] It’s a big test Maheen.
[13:49] I will go check on aunt.
[14:15] Sister in law, why did you do this?
[14:17] Because you wouldn’t have done it.
[14:19] You should have spoken to me once.
[14:21] I have tried so many times, Maheen,
[14:23] that you talk to me,
[14:24] share your sorrows with me,
[14:26] but no, you like hiding things.
[14:28] Now what did that do?
[14:31] now papa will tighten his screws,
[14:33] he has no shame,
[14:34] he has such a good wife and
he is having an affair outside.
[14:37] If he would have had an affair
with me as his wife, then it was wrong,
[14:41] but sister in law its my fault.
[14:45] Even after knowing he is with someone else,
[14:48] I came into his life shamelessly.
[14:51] Stop this self pity?
[14:53] What would you have done?
[14:54] Said no on the time of the wedding?
[14:56] He couldn’t say no on the time of
the wedding being a man,
[14:58] you would have said no being a woman.
[15:00] Stop it.
[15:01] Stop giving these justification and
give me the address of that girl,
[15:05] then you will see what I do.
[15:07] What?
[15:08] What will you say to her?
[15:10] I will insult her.
[15:12] Why sister in law?
[15:14] She never took away Umar from me,
[15:16] Umar was never mine.
[15:21] Maheen,
[15:23] me and Mansoor loved each other,
[15:26] we were lucky that
we got married to each other.
[15:29] If Mansoor’s parents had
married him to someone else,
[15:33] I wouldn’t have turned back and looked.
[15:34] That girl is the most responsible,
[15:37] who knows Umar is married,
still she instigates him.
[15:41] Sister in law,
[15:44] you did what you had to.
[15:47] Now what uncle says to Umar
and what he replies to him,
[15:55] that is important.
[15:57] Not that girl.
[16:01] Maheen.
[16:16] Papa,
[16:19] did Maheen tell you…
[16:21] No,
[16:24] she didn’t tell me anything,
[16:28] but I verified from him.
[16:33] What did you think?
[16:34] Your actions would remain hidden?
[16:36] You will have an affair
and we will stay quiet?
[16:40] Does this happen in decent people?
[16:45] Umar, you should have told me earlier.
[16:49] I tried papa,
[16:51] I thought I would say no,
[16:53] but the situation was not such then.
[16:56] Tell me one thing,
[16:58] had I said no then,
[17:00] would you have stepped
back from your decision?
[17:05] I may have done it,
[17:08] had I thought about it deeply.
[17:12] I would have found another way
to keep my brother’s respect
[17:15] and I might not have been able to do it.
[17:23] I might have thought that
its important to keep respect at this time.
[17:29] So papa, I was helpless, right?
[17:34] Okay,
[17:35] fine, you were helpless.
[17:37] What had to happen, happened.
[17:39] Even I was not happy with this relation,
[17:41] I was upset,
[17:43] but once she came to the house as a daughter in law
I accepted her with an open heart.
[17:49] Now you too forget everything
and live a proper life.
[17:53] I was trying, but…
[17:55] What did you try?
[17:57] You kept on meeting her,
[17:58] and see your courage,
[18:00] you told your wife too.
[18:02] You have no shame or not?
[18:04] Maheen understands me more
than you people,
[18:07] she has no objection,
she has no complaints from me,
[18:10] why are you people blaming me?
[18:12] She has no complaints from you?
[18:14] She has no sorrow? No objection?
[18:17] No papa, you can ask her.
[18:21] Then why did she went to her home?
[18:23] Why did she got upset and
went to her mother’s home?
[18:32] You shouldn’t have listened to him
and slapped him.
[18:38] What are you saying Razia?
[18:41] He is not a child,
[18:44] and its not a matter of getting
less marks in exams,
[18:49] this is the test of life.
[19:17] Umar,
[19:18] listen…
[19:20] Umar.
[19:21] Umar.
[19:23] Yes, go ahead Maheen.
[19:25] Did uncle…
[19:28] listen I didn’t tell him anything.
[19:35] If you didn’t tell him,
[19:36] then I will have to find the person who did,
because I need to thank them.
[19:42] Thank them?
[19:44] Yes,
[19:47] I had to tell them one day or another.
[19:52] I had so much burden on me,
[19:56] he took away half my burden,
[19:58] made it easy for me.
[20:02] Then you should be happy,
[20:05] I was worried for no reason.
[20:08] I will be happy when the rest of
my work will be easy.
[20:15] Listen.
[20:19] What now?
[20:22] I will make the rest of your work easy.
[20:28] Do thank me then.
[21:41] Roshni,
[21:43] stop these actions of yours,
[21:45] I will not tolerate these lectures.
[21:48] If you don’t fix yourself,
[21:50] I know how to fix you,
and that too really well.
[21:52] Why?
[21:53] Am I under imprisonment?
[21:56] Can I not get out anywhere?
Is there a restriction?
[21:58] Yes, there is a restriction,
[22:00] because single girls from decent homes
don’t come home so late at night
[22:04] and that too in the cars of others.
[22:07] No, I was coming in a rickshaw.
[22:10] Shut this nonsense.
[22:12] Khurshida saw everything from her roof
[22:14] that you came in someone’s car and
that too at the corner of the locality.
[22:18] Mama, that was my friend and her brother,
[22:23] and you are doubting me,
[22:25] that too listening to these
instigating women of the locality.
[22:27] Okay, so you came with your friend?
[22:30] If you came with a friend,
[22:31] why did you get off
at the corner of the locality,
[22:33] why didn’t you get dropped in front of the home?
[22:34] Why did you lie to me
that you came in a rickshaw?
[22:37] To save myself from all this.
[22:39] Because my friend’s brother
was driving the car.
[22:41] Now if had parked the car outside the home,
your doubts would have started from there only.
[22:46] I will still have doubts.
[22:48] Tell me, who is that girl,
I will also meet your friend?
[22:52] Mama, you are doubting me.
[22:54] I am not doubting you, I am sure madam.
[22:57] I feel you will ruin my respect for sure.
[23:02] You are after some goon.
[23:06] Mama, he is no goon,
[23:09] he is a good and decent man.
[23:11] These decent men don’t go around taking
daughters of other’s home out.
[23:16] Shameless girl.
[23:18] He will marry me and
he will bring a proposal really soon.
[23:23] I will see when he brings the proposal.
[23:31] That was a close call.
[23:35] Why doesn’t he reply.
[24:46] I am so helpless,
[24:49] I can worry for my sister,
[24:53] I can get sad for her,
[24:56] but I cannot do anything.
[25:00] Maheen is right,
[25:03] no matter what I do,
[25:06] I cannot bring love in Umar’s heart for her.
[25:42] Dear God,
[25:43] give me enough courage that
I can defeat my heart,
[25:48] give me the strength that
I can do what I am going to do.
[27:44] The breakfast is ready.
[27:47] Bring it here.
[27:50] Why?
[27:54] Mama and papa will be downstairs,
I will have to face them,
[27:58] and then grandma would be there too.
[28:00] No, you won’t have to face anyone,
you rest assured.
[28:04] Not even uncle.
[28:08] Before they make any decision,
[28:12] they would want to discuss it with me,
[28:14] they would want to know if I agree or not,
[28:16] so no one will say anything to you right now.
[28:23] Decision?
[28:27] The same,
[28:31] that you are waiting for.
[28:34] Just remember,
[28:36] you have to thank me.
[28:44] Tell me something, Maheen.
[28:48] Why would you do all this?
[28:51] And who would you do it for?
[28:56] You said it yourself that I am your friend.
[29:01] The truest friend,
[29:05] now you put so much burden
of our friendship on me,
[29:12] I have to remove it.
[29:36] You are not at peace,
[29:39] instead of staying on your bed comfortably,
[29:43] you go around so much.
[29:51] You are not well Fareed.
[29:53] No, its your superstition mama.
[30:00] Hello.
[30:01] Hello. Live long.
[30:04] I am just going, bye.
[30:06] Okay, bye.
[30:08] Go safe, come back safe.
[30:11] See Fareed,
[30:13] our Umar has become so smart,
and responsible.
[30:17] In his age, even you were
not this smart and responsible,
[30:20] he cares for everyone so much,
he cares for everyone.
[30:23] He worries.
[30:24] Umar.
[30:28] Yes papa.
[30:34] Come back in the evening,
[30:37] don’t get too late.
[30:41] I have to talk about something important.
[30:48] Yes.
[30:50] Fine.
[31:02] What do you want to talk about, Fareed?
[31:04] Is everything ok?
[31:06] Yes, everything is fine.
[31:11] No, there is something,
[31:15] I have been seeing since yesterday,
day before, everyone is upset.
[31:19] Everyone is quiet,
[31:22] there is something that
all of you are hiding it from me.
[31:27] You are mistaken mama,
[31:30] another superstition.
[31:34] Yes,
[31:36] I have grown old,
[31:38] I am old,
[31:41] I have no importance in this home,
no one tells me anything.
[31:46] Everyone hides things from me.
[32:07] What do you say?
[32:12] Should we talk to Umar straightforwardly?
[32:32] First let me decide
what I have to talk about.
[32:34] What is there to think about in this?
[32:36] Tell him clearly to take out
that girl from his heart
[32:40] and live in this home like a decent man.
[32:42] If there is a need, scold him.
[32:50] If I had found out about
this some time back, Razia.
[32:55] I would have been strict with Umar,
[32:59] I would have forced him,
[33:03] but now this will not happen.
[33:08] Why?
[33:09] Why can’t it happen now?
[33:15] I have seen death from up-close Razia.
[33:27] So much life has passed,
[33:30] yours and my wedding,
kids, their wedding.
[33:39] We saw success and defeat,
we saw it all.
[33:47] We didn’t lose the will to live.
[33:51] You know when I saw death in front of me,
[33:56] all the hidden happiness in
my heart came in front of my eyes,
[34:03] that I won’t be able to see
them being complete.
[34:06] God forbid,
[34:09] what are you saying?'
[34:23] I have lived my life,
[34:26] in fact, figured it out.
[34:30] When someone like me feels this way,
[34:33] then my Umar is a child,
[34:37] won’t he have wishes in his heart?
[34:43] Do I make him regret?
[34:46] Hey,
[34:49] how have you started thinking?
[34:54] For God’s sake Mr. Fareed, be smart.
[34:59] Will you get cursed by the family
to fulfil your son’s wish?
[35:05] Will you make a new example by bringing
a second wife on top of your niece.
[35:10] That’s it.
[35:11] That’s it.
[35:13] That is where I stop thinking about Maheen.
[35:21] You and I can’t get her,
her happiness and right even if we want to.
[35:28] Even if we listen to Umar and even
if we don’t listen to Umar, then too.
[35:39] Then too?
[35:41] Look,
[35:43] if we scold and force
Umar to live with Maheen,
[35:52] how will Maheen stay happy with someone about
whom she knows that he likes someone else.
[36:00] Tell me.
[36:04] With time everything gets fine.
