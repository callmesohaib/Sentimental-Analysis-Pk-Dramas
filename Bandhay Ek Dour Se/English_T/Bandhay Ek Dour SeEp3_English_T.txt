[00:24] Hello.
[00:25] Hello.
[00:26] Hey, had I known you people would come too,
I would have made breakfast for 2 more people.
[00:32] I will make it, 
it will take 2 minutes.
[00:34] Thank you aunt.
[00:35] Thank God we had
breakfast before we left.
[00:38] They ate already.
[00:40] What do you mean early morning,
[00:42] its 1 pm, and half the day has passed,
[00:44] what do we get?
Half fried eggs and dry toasts.
[00:50] Mama, eat happily,
[00:53] you know 
Zakia has a lot of things to do.
[00:57] I have spoiled her by feeding her fried bread,
you don’t mind Zakia.
[01:03] Where is papa?
[01:06] Papa? He is busy preparing for the
parties from the morning to evening.
[01:11] Just like, 
he was supposed to do all this.
[01:16] We will…
[01:17] Check Monis,
[01:20] he left in the morning.
[01:22] Even Umar didn’t stay for a while,
[01:24] now Fareed will have to do all the work.
[01:28] Monis is back.
[01:39] Hello.
[01:40] Hello.
[01:49] Hey Zakia, Monis has grown up,
you should have taught him
[01:53] some manners to talk to
the guests at home,
[01:55] Mansoor stood up to say hi,
he left without saying hello.
[02:28] Hey, you are still sitting?
[02:30] We have to go to the engagement,
[02:32] you take 4 hours to get ready.
[02:35] I don’t have to go to the engagement.
[02:37] Why not?
[02:39] Maheen is such a good friend of yours.
[02:41] She is not my good friend,
[02:44] she is cunning.
[02:46] Okay stop it,
don’t be so stubborn, get up.
[02:49] It’s the neighbors and then,
[02:52] this is the time when
girls should be visible.
[02:56] Now see,
[02:57] your friend Maheen got her
roposal the same way,
[03:00] when she went to
Muniza’s Milad to recite a Naat.
[03:04] Mama, what do I do?
Should I do what she did?
[03:08] Oh God, my child,
[03:11] I wish God had given you the guidance,
it would have been great.
[03:15] Now get ready, listen,
[03:18] you have no manners, no talent,
[03:21] but He gave you a pretty face,
[03:26] stop it.
[03:27] I want that some good
proposal comes on this face,
[03:32] it will be great.
[03:33] Now don’t waste time,
get ready on time.
[03:36] Sure.
[03:51] Brother,
[03:52] you went to get Umar.
[03:55] Umar didn’t come,
[03:56] but a lot of questions came,
you will answer those.
[04:01] What is wrong with him?
[04:02] First you answer my questions honestly.
[04:06] Did you know about
Umar and Fazeela from start?
[04:09] Huh?
[04:10] Umar and…
[04:13] Yes,
[04:15] Umar says, he and 
Fazeela love each other,
[04:19] I came in between them
[04:21] and you know about them from before.
[04:24] Still you stayed quiet when my
wedding was being fixed with her.
[04:27] When did I…Umar…
Umar was…
[04:30] I was thinking what happened to Umar,
[04:34] now I get it,
[04:35] when mama told them that
I was getting married,
[04:37] he freaked out.
[04:41] One minute,
[04:43] what did mama say?
What details did she share about Fazeela?
[04:46] Look, I don’t know what details mama shared
and what she didn’t, that is not my issue.
[04:49] The real thing is that I wont marry a
girl who loves someone else.
[04:54] Will you tell mama, or should I?
[04:56] No one will tell anyone anything.
[04:58] You just stay here. You and
Umar are so hasty and stupid.
[05:02] You don’t have to do anything,
or we will have another issue.
[05:06] You don’t have to say anything,
you don’t have to go from here. Okay?
[05:10] I will be back.
[06:07] Hummmm
[06:15] Hey, hurry up, 
are the clothes ironed or not?
[06:19] Is she not ready yet?
[06:24] Are you calling Umar?
[06:26] Yeah.
[06:28] Why?
[06:30] He is not answering my call,
he should hear what I have to say.
[06:43] Monis.
[06:50] Maheen,
[06:51] you will get engaged, don’t call him,
it will create a scene.
[06:55] Sister, he should
consider that I will get engaged,
[06:58] he should at least listen to me.
[07:00] Why?
[07:01] Brother Monis. Fazeela. 
Come here.
[07:04] Sit sit. Come here. Quick.
[07:06] What happened?
[07:06] Sit.
[07:07] What happened?
[07:11] I want to take your picture.
[07:12] Take mine too.
[07:13] You are the bride, you are getting married
and you want to take my picture?
[07:17] Oh God, the camera is not opening.
[07:18] Stay here. Look here.
[07:21] Me?
[07:22] I will take your picture later.
[07:23] Hey, get ready quickly,
I have to get ready too.
[07:26] You are not ready yet?
[07:27] No, let her get ready first.
[07:29] I will see.
[07:30] You ask her to hurry up. 
Hurry up.
[07:32] What is the scene?
[07:34] Nothing you go.
[07:43] Idiot, this is Fazeela,
[07:45] my sister in law, who is getting
married to brother Monis,
[07:48] I have a 1000 other neighbors
apart from Roshni, get it?
[08:08] Idiot, this is Fazeela,
[08:10] my sister in law, who is 
getting married to brother Monis,
[08:13] I have a 1000 other neighbors 
apart from Roshni, get it?
[09:56] Hey, take this. Come here.
Hey, Monis, come here.
[10:00] Leave my hand.
[10:01] Come on dance. 
Everyone is watching us.
[10:04] This. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:05] Leave me man.
[10:06] I was joking, I swear
[10:09] Stop this nonsense, its not what
you are saying right now. Okay?
[10:13] Its already late, I will tell mama,
[10:17] I will not marry a girl
who loves someone else, ok?
[10:18] Hey, shut up idiot, don’t do that.
I said I was joking.
[10:23] Okay fine, I wont say it, I will not take your name,
[10:26] but I will not marry that girl either.
I know you two have this…
[10:30] Hey man, I swear I was joking,
I swear to God, I was lying.
[10:34] How do I believe you that this is nonsense,
or what you said earlier was nonsense.
[10:38] Can I swear to you?
[10:39] Yes swear falsely on me,
so that I can fall and die over here.
[10:42] I am moving out of the way,
[10:44] then why do you have to kill me 
and get me out of your way?
[10:45] Hey man, I swear to me,
lets go to the mosque.
[10:51] Are you telling the truth?
[10:52] I swear I am telling the truth.
[10:54] I lied. See,
[10:56] Fazeela is looking at you,
[10:58] I mean sister in law Fazeela,
[11:01] if you ask me, I will call her my sister 
all my life, sister Fazeela.
[11:06] Come on man.
[11:07] Yeah! Yeah! Yes!
[12:26] I will see Umar, I will go home and ask
him what was this all about?
[12:30] What is wrong? He came.
[12:31] Hey,
[12:32] he came, so he should act like a guest,
[12:35] see how he is serving food,
he looks like a waiter.
[12:40] You work like this on your sister’s wedding.
[12:42] He throws tantrums at his maternal side,
[12:44] but with his paternal side,
he becomes a servant.
[13:15] I think he has come here to do something,
he didn’t all of a sudden have a change of heart.
[13:21] Boys today and their loves are weak,
[13:25] they start and end quickly,
[13:28] I am sure he got a grip on himself.
[13:30] Huh?
[13:30] He looks happy.
[13:32] He is not happy.
[13:37] Hey, will you have something. 
Have this?
[13:40] No, this is enough.
[13:43] Hey, what is this?
[13:44] You should have told me
I would have got you some fresh food.
[13:51] Have this, I will add it.
[13:53] No, its enough.
[13:54] No, not true.
[13:58] I will leave this here,
I will get some more.
[14:11] You are so stupid,
[14:14] you didn’t hear the whole
story and created a scene.
[14:16] Man, I treated Monis badly.
[14:20] I have cleared brother’s doubt,
[14:22] I insulted Roshni so much cause of you.
[14:25] She calmed down with difficulty,
if you hold your ears, she might cool down.
[14:29] Should I go meet her on the roof?
[14:32] Message her,
[14:35] everyone is busy with the guest,
it’s a good chance.
[14:37] Umhhh..
[14:44] Hold this.
[14:49] Hum,
Don’t eat it all
[14:53] I saw the stupid gifts they got,
[14:56] if this what they brought in the engagement,
[14:58] then the bari will have second hand clothes.
[15:01] Hey mama,
give and take is two way,
[15:04] if Zakia had given her son in law a lot in dowry,
she could have complained.
[15:09] She gave him an ordinary ring,
so obviously they did this.
[15:15] So what would I have done? 
Given him a gold set?
[15:17] These rings are given on engagement,
I did the same.
[15:22] The boys family, they have not much to do,
[15:25] some clothes and jewelry, that is it.
[15:28] Us girl’s family have a lot of expenses.
[15:31] Listen. Listen.
[15:33] Umar just left Mahi’s room.
[15:35] Quiet.
[15:37] What quiet?
[15:40] Your brother and sister in law got this, 
right?
[15:44] Lets see what they got.
[15:46] Show me.
[15:47] Yes, this one.
[15:48] Oh no, this plastic jug?
[15:54] My brother has a big heart,
my sister in law is really cunning,
[15:58] she wouldn’t have
let him give something good.
[16:05] I thought you were only stupid,
[16:08] but you are a donkey too.
[16:11] What are you saying Roshni,
[16:14] I am caring for you,
[16:15] giving you a swing and you are
talking to your future husband like this.
[16:23] You are not acting like my future husband.
[16:27] I have seen your obedience,
[16:29] you cannot marry me in fact
you can marry no one.
[16:32] You cannot talk about the wedding?
Who are you the girl?
[16:36] You look so cute, my cat.
[16:39] Okay listen to me,
[16:41] number one,
[16:43] I am in your mother’s eyes now,
[16:47] I will give her a medication for joint pain,
[16:51] she will say yes.
[16:54] Number two,
[16:56] mama was telling papa that Monis
found a good girl from the same locality,
[17:01] so papa said,
[17:02] that you find your second
daughter in law from this locality.
[17:05] Third and most important that aunt
[17:09] Zakia and mama are friends now,
[17:12] the situation is good,
[17:14] things are looking great,
[17:16] I will get aunt to say that
[17:19] there is a cute girl in the locality,
[17:22] really good, 
get my proposal for her.
[17:27] Wow my lion,
[17:29] what if number four
and five have an issue.
[17:33] No my doll, there will be no issue.
There will be no issue.
[17:36] Look, today is the perfect day,
[17:39] since morning, mama and
aunt had no issues, no fights,
[17:44] everything went fine,
the situation is positive.
[17:48] Oh God damn it,
[17:50] hey, people have forgotten
about their blood relations,
[17:54] its such a close relation
and you gave me a cheap gift.
[17:58] This is worse than beggars.
Brother Fareed,
[18:01] what is this?
You are worse then beggars?
[18:04] Mama, be quiet, you are saying
all that you have in your heart.
[18:07] Aunt and mama?
[18:08] Yes, is this a gift to give.
[18:11] This looks like a dogs coffin.
[18:14] I ave always given 
you good at all times.
[18:16] Roshni
[18:17] We wont even give this in charity.
[18:21] Razia,
[18:22] See mama,
[18:23] you think I am wrong,
[18:25] even if I give this dress to my servant
she would throw it in my face.
[18:29] She has no shame.
[18:31] Mama, be quiet.
[18:32] Why should I be quiet?
[18:33] I have been insulted, 
now I will insult her,
[18:36] I will show the whole family this great dress,
I will show it to everyone.
[18:41] Stop it mama,
this is nothing to get upset on.
[18:45] Why is this not something 
to get upset on?
[18:47] This cloth cant even
be used to mop the floor,
[18:51] this is what she is throwing in
my princess like daughter’s face.
[18:56] Razia, what did you do?
[18:58] You should have thought of the family.
[19:01] What is this Razia?
[19:03] You should have thought
about it before giving such a gift.
[19:05] No, aunt, I like it,
I will wear it, you don’t get upset.
[19:10] You be quiet.
[19:13] First, let me fix your mother.
[19:16] Okay,
[19:17] so Zakia, this dress,
this is a coffin for dogs,
[19:23] and no one would give this
in charity for their servant
[19:28] and this cannot be used
to mop the floor and yes,
[19:34] the people who give this gift
are people whose blood is white.
[19:39] This is what you said?
[19:41] Stop it Razia.
Its your fault.
[19:44] You be quiet,
I will tell you who is at fault.
[19:48] Yes Zakia, tell me,
[19:51] now you will show this
dress to the whole family
[19:54] so that you can show them the
worth of the one who gave it.
[19:57] Mama, stop it, what happened to you?
[19:59] Yes, this is what I have said,
I am not afraid of anyone.
[20:02] Come on then, go ahead.
[20:03] Put this dress on exhibition.
[20:06] Tell everyone.
[20:07] Mama I will tell everyone
where this dress came from.
[20:12] If your memory is not weak,
did you forget?
[20:16] You gave this to me
on my Mansoor’s wedding.
[20:29] Mama, stop dwelling in the past,
leave it.
[20:32] You shut up,
[20:33] since then I have had this
fire burning inside me.
[20:37] God damn it, such a blame.
[20:39] Hey, I have witnesses.
[20:41] Who?
[20:42] Both sisters in law, 
try to deny this in front of them.
[20:45] What are you saying?
[20:47] What do you want to say?
[20:48] I had decided I would keep this dress safe
and throw it in your face on some occasion.
[20:53] Mama, stop it. 
Damn you.
[20:55] You leave. You leave. 
Yes leave from here. Get out.
[20:58] Stop it guys.
[21:00] You get out.
[21:01] You leave. 
Yes leave from here. Get out.
[21:19] Roshni.
[21:22] Roshni.
[21:26] Roshni, get up.
[21:31] Get up you lazy bum its 12.
[21:34] No.
[21:36] mama, I slept so late.
[21:41] Okay,
[21:42] so I kept you up all night? 
Get up now.
[21:46] Listen,
[21:47] you have to set the curtains 
and take off the dirty ones.
[21:53] Get the room cleaned by the maid,
[21:57] Shahista is coming for 2-3 days.
[21:59] Your distant relatives are coming, 
you don’t see them for years,
[22:04] still they come to stay at our home.
[22:06] So what if they are distant relatives,
[22:08] she is my childhood friend.
[22:10] She is your friend, 
you care for her.
[22:13] Okay stop it, don’t insult me.
[22:16] I have done half of your work, 
do what is left.
[22:21] I am going to Zakia,
[22:24] you know there was a scene at their home late at night.
[22:27] Yes mama, 
she fought with her sister in law.
[22:32] Yes. Oh God,
[22:33] she looks like someone who would fight.
[22:36] Poor Zakia has bad in-laws.
[22:41] Stop it mama, aunt Zakia is no good,
[22:44] her in laws are nice people.
[22:46] I am telling you aunt 
Zakia started the fight.
[22:49] Stop it aunt Zakia didn’t start the fight.
[22:51] You saw her sister in law,
[22:53] oh God, she must spit poison.
[22:56] See how she has kept her 
daughter in law in control. Why wouldn’t she do it?
[23:00] Her husband is afraid of her mother,
[23:03] he must take up after his father.
[23:05] Razia has her husband, mother in law 
and daughter in law under her control,
[23:10] oh God, I think that the girl 
who gets married in that home,
[23:14] what will happen to her?
[23:16] You know mama,
[23:18] her younger son doesn’t look like a 
coward like her elder son. Right?
[23:22] Hey, how do you know Roshni?
[23:24] I find him weird, he is 
always in between women,
[23:27] aunts, aunts, aunt,
[23:30] these men don’t leave their mother’s 
side and they don’t earn much either.
[23:36] He looks gay to me,
[23:39] anyway, I am going you 
take care of the home.
[23:44] Sure.
[23:47] Gay!
[23:57] I thought all would be fixed,
[23:59] we would be one and 
our issue will be solved,
[24:03] but…
[24:13] Oh, that’s the end then,
[24:16] and that Umar was saying that aunt 
would bring her mother to our home.
[24:20] Liar.
[24:21] Don’t say that, he is not a liar.
[24:24] He lies, then he hides his face.
[24:27] He made an excuse today,
[24:29] he will make another one after 
a few days, I am tired of this.
[24:35] Listen, you tell Umar that
[24:37] his dream of sending my mother and 
aunt to get your proposal can never be fulfilled.
[24:43] He goes with aunt 
Razia and ask for your hand.
[24:47] Yes and my mother gives her a negative 
response and things are over.
[24:52] Why? Doesn’t your 
mother want to marry you?
[24:55] Man,
[24:57] there is a sad story and that is that,
[24:59] in our family, 
the weddings are done by caste,
[25:05] or if not that, then we marry in people we know.
[25:07] Now mama is friends 
with aunt Zakia,
[25:10] she will convince my mother.
[25:12] Umar’s mother is a 
stranger to my mother,
[25:15] and mama’s opinion of 
Umar’s mother is not too good,
[25:18] thanks to your mother.
[25:20] She is always cursing her 
mother in law and sister in law.
[25:24] She has told weird 
stories about her in-laws.
[25:28] How will all this be fixed Roshni?
[25:30] Hey bride, you don’t worry, 
all be fine. You prepare for your wedding.
[25:38] But there is one thing,
[25:40] if Umar comes again and 
says he wants to meet me,
[25:44] you will not call me 
and make an excuse.
[25:47] Roshni…
[25:48] I don’t want these useless meetings,
[25:51] there is not point in this.
[25:53] This Umar can do nothing.
[25:55] Oh God, I got really late.
[25:59] Mama’s cousin aunt Shahista has to come,
[26:02] I have a lot to do. Can I take your phone, 
I don’t have balance?
[26:06] I will return it.
[26:07] Hah, no. no. no.
[26:09] pleas
[26:09] My lovely ROshni, no, 
listen to me.
[26:12] Bye. Bye. Bye. I love you.
[26:13] I want my phone.
[26:16] Roshni, I want it.
[26:20] This is the limit,
[26:23] such an old planning,
[26:25] since when did she have this poison and 
she was waiting for the moment
[26:28] I had told you earlier Fareed, 
she is a snake, not human,
[26:32] the one who bites.
[26:35] But you said she is naïve, 
she is simple,
[26:39] now you saw the simple, 
naïve, biting snake.
[26:43] Stop it mama.
[26:45] Seeing dramas with snakes, 
you always think of then.
[26:49] Ok,
[26:51] you have no shame for what you did.
[26:55] Its possible her condition was not 
good at the time of Mansoor’s wedding,
[26:58] that she couldn’t give a good gift.
[27:00] No but you ruined her 
respect and insulted her.
[27:08] Leave it mama,
[27:09] you will see her real respect on 
Monis and Maheen’s wedding.
[27:13] You didn’t like what I said,
[27:16] but you didn’t see what she did.
[27:18] How was she talking with my dress in hand,
[27:22] I had this thing hidden 
in my chest for so long.
[27:28] Oh God, so patient.
[27:32] Fine,
[27:34] whatever happened was not good, 
we should act like elders,
[27:38] it’s the matter of our child, 
its our daughter.
[27:43] Fareed, you are right.
[27:44] I should have waited till Monis’ wife,
[27:48] I should have given his wife this dress, 
like she gave to my Mansoor.
[27:52] Like you gave great things to Mansoor’s wife. 
It was all second hand.
[27:58] It was great mama, really great.
[28:05] if Umar comes again and 
says he wants to meet me,
[28:07] you will not call me and make an excuse.
[28:10] I don’t want these useless meetings,
[28:12] there is not point in this. 
This Umar can do nothing.
[28:19] Why are you not getting tea?
[28:21] The stove is not open?
[28:24] Oh, I think there is no gas.
[28:26] Okay, then tell Monis to get it from the 
market and also get something to it,
[28:29] or she will insult me by saying 
I sent her away just like that.
[28:31] Like always. Hurry up.
[28:39] Brother Monis.
[28:41] We will meet in the evening.
[28:42] Who are you?
[28:45] Who Umar?
[28:49] Who gave you my number?
[28:54] Yes,
[28:56] thank you so much,
[28:58] don’t bother.
[29:00] Hey if you are that free,
[29:04] then take your grandma 
who has a 1000 diseases.
[29:12] Mama, who was it? 
What happened?
[29:13] Hey, that Zakia’s sister in law’s son,
[29:17] the one who is always around women.
[29:19] I told you he was cheap.
[29:21] Did you see how he was 
acting on the engagement,
[29:24] he was going crazy dancing 
and playing the drum. He is useless.
[29:30] Yes mama, you are telling me 
his greatness, what happened?
[29:35] Leave it,
[29:37] he was getting free 
with me for no reason,
[29:40] saying aunty, we have doctors,
[29:43] you get your joint pain treated.
[29:45] In fact, I will take you, see him.
[29:47] He doesn’t know me, 
today he called me.
[29:52] Awesome.
[29:54] Mama, this is his sympathy, 
you scolded him for no reason.
[29:59] Stop it,
[30:00] I know the sympathies of such men, 
that is alive for women.
[30:04] Also, in our Islam a woman is clearly told
[30:09] to treat strangers with tough tone,
[30:12] so that they don’t dare again.
[30:15] Look at him, he didn’t 
care for my age, he is after me.
[30:19] Damn it mama, 
he is the age of your son.
[30:23] In my eyes, not in his.
[30:28] I saw him at the engagement,
[30:29] he was roaming around me.
[30:32] He was making excuses to talk.
[30:34] You eat this, you do this, 
I know such men well.
[30:39] Oh God, what time is it, 
boys don’t leave married women.
[30:44] Tsk. Tsk. Roshni,
[30:48] I have thought,
[30:49] where ever I go, 
I will not wear bright colors,
[30:54] nor put on dark lipstick,
[30:57] people are mistaken for no reason.
[31:15] I told I don’t want to meet you.
[31:19] What are you punishing 
me for Roshni? What is my fault?
[31:25] Fault?
[31:27] Umar, your fault is that in attempts 
to fix everything, you are ruining it further,
[31:33] what is messed up, 
you are messing it further.
[31:36] Now what was the 
need to call my mother?
[31:39] You have any idea 
how upset she is.
[31:41] I was trying to ensure that 
her heart melts for me,
[31:45] you had switched off your phone.
[31:48] Umar,
[31:50] you were melting her heart?
[31:53] Everything melted away.
[31:55] You know there is one thing,
[31:56] you can do nothing,
[31:59] you couldn’t convince 
your mother for me,
[32:01] you couldn’t fix the fight 
between your mother and aunt,
[32:04] nor are you capable of coming in and asking for 
my hand yourself so that my family says yes.
[32:12] You can’t find a job.
[32:15] Roshni, don’t say that.
[32:17] Okay, tell me something, 
if I remove these issues, then?
[32:25] then do it,
[32:27] I will meet you after that.
[32:29] Umar, I am not that cheap that 
I waste myself in your cheap love.
[32:36] Roshni.
[32:37] Roshni, see who is here.
[32:40] Umar, I am going,
[32:42] please don’t call me, don’t message 
me again and again. Please.
[32:47] Bye.
[33:01] you are still the same, 
beautiful and smart. What is the deal?
[33:05] You are the same, 
you have not changed.
[33:12] Hello.
[33:16] She has grown so big,
[33:18] you were this small when I saw you.
[33:23] Mama, where do I keep this?
[33:25] Come inside.
[33:31] Hello.
[33:34] Hi, I am Nabeel.
[33:42] Roshni.
[33:49] Meet ZUbaida.
[33:51] How are you aunty
[33:52] How are you?
[33:53] I am fine.
[33:54] He has grown good.
[33:56] Yes.
[33:57] Will you stand here, come inside.
[33:58] Yeah.
[33:59] You fix food.
[34:01] I will take it.
[34:02] No, I am ok, I will take it.
[34:06] Will you have something? Tea or coffee?
[34:11] Coffee.
[34:11] Fine.
[34:20] I love chicken.
[34:22] Eat well.
[34:23] I got fresh bread, you want some?
[34:26] Yess.
[34:28] Ask Nabeel.
[34:30] No aunty, thank you, I am good.
[34:34] give him kebabs, go.
[34:37] Kebabs, home made.
[34:41] Thank you.
[34:46] Hello.
[34:47] Hello, hey Maheen, come have food.
[34:51] No aunt, I ate. I wanted to talk 
to Roshni, I want my phone.
[35:02] Yes, my phone battery died,
I will return Maheen’s phone.
[35:06] Come Maheen, 
I will give you back your phone.
[35:18] She is really pretty? Who is she?
[35:21] She lives in our neighbors, 
she will get married soon.
[35:30] Yeah;
[35:37] Here you go, your phone,
[35:39] I was coming to return it.
[35:41] You insulted me in front of the guests that
[35:43] I take your phone and use it, 
are you a friend or foe?
[35:47] I didn’t mean it like that.
[35:49] Taking the phone is an excuse,
[35:51] I wanted to tell you, Umar came,
[35:53] he is really worried, 
he was asking about you.
[35:57] What is new in that? He is always worried 
and I am tired of hearing his worries.
[36:03] I have a 1000 things to do. Look,
[36:05] I have guests over, 
you will have to leave.
[36:36] One more claim.
[36:38] Till I am not successful in my mission, 
I will not call you or message you.
[36:45] Thank God I am free.
[36:48] I will bring my proposal to your home, 
wait for me.
[36:52] I am useless that I wait for you.
[37:02] Hey.
[37:03] Hey,
[37:06] you are back.
[37:08] Yes, I was actually getting bored 
with mama and aunty,
[37:12] and God knows how many 
more relatives they wanted to visit.
[37:15] so I made an excuse and came back
[37:18] So you made an excuse, 
you didn’t go out.
[37:23] I did.
[37:24] What is there in the city to see, 
so I came home.
[37:29] So is there something 
worth watching here?
[37:34] At least I will get tea made 
by your hands here.
