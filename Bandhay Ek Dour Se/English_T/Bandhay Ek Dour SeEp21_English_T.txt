[00:42] He is not yours,
[00:44] he loves me.
[00:47] Even after knowing all this you
are still living with him,
[00:51] being called his wife.
[01:12] Umar is the one who is going to suffer between us.
[01:15] He cannot give me pain,
nor can he give you pain.
[01:20] He is suffering alone.
[01:22] There are two ways out of this,
[01:25] either you leave him,
[01:27] or I leave him.
[01:29] No one is forcing anyone.
[01:32] But I love Umar,
[01:35] I will have to think for him.
[01:43] Thank God I am not in your place,
[01:46] so what if I don’t have Umar,
[01:49] I have his love.
[01:51] I am proud
[01:52] that I am giving away my love,
[01:56] not snatching it from someone.
[01:59] If I was in your place Maheen,
I would have died
[02:02] Thinking that I got such a person for all my life
[02:05] who can never be mine.
[02:49] You have played a big game Roshni.
[02:53] If all that you are thinking doesn’t happen.
[02:57] What if you find out that Umar and Maheen
go for their honeymoon.
[03:20] No,
[03:21] this is not possible.
[03:24] I know Maheen since childhood.
[03:27] I know the exact points 
that I need to press.
[03:32] She will do whatever I have thought.
[04:07] Umar,
[04:09] Roshni came.
[04:13] She was saying…
[04:14] I don’t want to know what she was saying.
[04:17] Don’t repeat what she said,
[04:19] it will hurt me.
[04:22] Whatever she did is for me and you.
[04:27] Now you be happy.
[04:28] I will be happy?
[04:30] I will be happy giving you pain?
[05:28] Man, leave some corner of the home,
where a man can worry alone.
[05:38] You can pretend that I am not here,
[05:42] you carry on with your worries.
[05:44] I will not interfere in anything.
[05:50] You go downstairs and be worried.
[05:53] Papa is downstairs,
[05:56] I am hiding from him.
[06:03] Why don’t you go to your room
and get worried?
[06:07] Najia is there.
[06:09] And I am hiding from her.
[06:13] I did something weird in the morning
[06:18] and now I don’t have the courage to face her.
[06:25] I too am hiding from papa,
[06:29] he has a lot of questions for me.
[06:38] Umar,
[06:41] how have our parents brought us up?
[06:46] We hurt someone a little,
And we choose to hide our faces from them.
[06:53] I don’t know who are those people that break someone’s 
heart and go around like nothing happened.
[07:02] You are right.
[07:06] I don’t know how people hurt others
[07:09] and stay happy.
[07:14] Did you hurt someone?
[07:27] I don’t know,
[07:30] maybe.
[09:33] You stayed up all night worried.
[09:37] And you too?
[09:41] You didn’t ask me about
the reason of my worry.
[09:45] At least tell me about your worry.
[09:50] I knew
[09:53] that you must be up worried about
something related to your children.
[09:57] I too am a father,
[10:00] so how can I be worried about anything else.
[10:06] Did Mansoor tell you anything?
[10:10] I am worried because of Umar.
[10:14] Umar?
[10:17] What happened to Umar?
[10:21] Maybe he is not happy with this wedding,
[10:25] with Mahi.
[10:29] Why do you feel this way?
[10:32] Did Umar tell you this himself?
[10:36] He wasn’t clear about it.
[10:41] but there is definitely something 
going on between them.
[10:44] No Fareed,
[10:46] I didn’t feel that way.
[10:49] Mahi is busy with herself,
[10:53] no fights, no arguments,
[10:55] Nothing has been shown between those two.
[11:00] that’s abnormal.
[11:02] Then its definitely not normal.
[11:08] A husband & wife have a thousand complaints.
[11:17] I feel remorse, Razia.
[11:21] I made the wrong decision in my haste.
[11:27] Umar is not happy with this wedding.
[11:50] Will you drop me at my mother’s place?
[11:53] No, keep this here.
[11:57] You please ask Monis, he will take you.
[12:00] Listen, Maheen,
[12:05] actually I don’t want to go there.
[12:09] I don’t want myself in any such situation.
[12:15] I have promised Roshni
[12:18] and I don’t want to go against my promise.
[12:22] I will not try to meet her.
[12:30] You ask Monis,
[12:33] he will take you
[12:35] and he will also drop you back.
[13:22] I…
[13:24] I think you slept late last night,
[13:28] its time to go to the office,
I will make breakfast.
[13:30] No. No.
[13:35] I am in no hurry,
[13:37] take your time in making the breakfast,
I don’t have to go to work today.
[13:42] We have missed yesterday’s appointment,
[13:47] I have to go there today.
[13:49] I don’t want to go.
[13:51] But I have to go.
[13:53] You can go if you want to,
but I don’t want to go.
[14:04] I will go,
[14:07] and you will come along with me.
[14:10] Mansoor,
[14:12] I don’t want any such test done that
put these useless thoughts in your head.
[14:18] Don’t you trust my love?
[14:27] Its not about trust, Najia.
[14:32] You too at times, used to get scared,
get worried and ask me,
[14:39] that if I would remarry under their pressure.
[14:44] When you have fear of
losing me in your heart,
[14:49] then how can I not have
such a fear in my heart?
[14:51] I cannot leave you.
[14:55] Did I go against everyone,
[14:57] against the world and married you for this?
[15:03] Najia,
[15:06] this is what we forgot.
[15:10] Before becoming husband and wife,
[15:12] we have another relation of heart.
[15:20] A wedding is a pure relation,
[15:26] but its not strong,
[15:29] it breaks, it unbreaks,
[15:34] but the relations of heart never break,
[15:39] love never ends, Najia.
[15:46] After thinking all night,
[15:49] my heart is now satisfied,
[15:53] I have thought, I have decided that
[15:56] we will go to the doctor.
[15:59] Whatever happens, we will see.
[16:03] At least once,
[16:06] we should find out that
[16:08] if we need to keep hope or not,
[16:13] or think about something else.
[16:16] What something else?
[16:18] That can we live with this or not?
[16:27] Whether its your lacking or mine.
[16:37] If there is a lacking in you, I promise you,
[16:42] I will never leave you alone,
[16:46] I will not get married again.
[16:49] We will adopt a child
[16:54] but if you want it, only then.
[17:01] But,
[17:05] if the problem is with me,
[17:08] then still,
[17:11] you will make all the decisions yourself.
[17:18] If you want to accept me or not,
[17:22] whether we adopt a child or not.
[17:31] Najia,
[17:34] I once again with an open
heart saying this to you,
[17:42] to complete yourself,
[17:46] if you have to leave me
and marry someone else…
[17:52] I cannot leave you,
[17:56] I really love you.
[18:00] Now if I am lacking or you are,
[18:04] the two of us have to stay with each other
and that too happily. Ok?
[18:15] I know, thank you.
[18:17] I love you for that.
[18:19] Thank you.
[18:41] I am making spinach for dinner,
you like it, right?
[18:45] Yes, but call Umar and ask, if he is coming,
I will ask Monis to get chicken.
[18:53] Mama, can I ask you something?
[18:54] Yes, go ahead.
[18:57] If you find something,
[19:01] I mean, just like walking on the road,
[19:03] you find something,
[19:06] what should you do?
[19:10] Should you keep it?
[19:13] What did you find? From where?
[19:15] Mama, tell me,
[19:17] if you find something like this,
[19:20] then isn’t keeping it theft?
[19:24] No, you found it on God’s ground,
how is it theft?
[19:27] What is it?
 Is it something made out of gold.
[19:30] No.
[19:32] No, I didn’t find it,
[19:34] someone found it,
[19:35] they were asking me,
so I didn’t have an answer.
[19:39] So I thought I would ask you.
[19:41] Oh.
[19:44] But mama, that is theft,
[19:46] keeping something that someone else owns,
making it yours with pride.
[19:51] No,
[19:52] when you found it on the way, its yours.
[19:54] Who knows who owns it,
where it came from, what is theft in this?
[19:57] Keep it quietly.
[20:00] But if you know who it belongs to,
[20:04] in fact,
[20:06] you know them well, then?
[20:10] Yes,
[20:12] if you know then
you should return it immediately,
[20:14] it is unfair
[20:16] and if it belongs to someone you know,
there is no point in keeping it.
[20:21] Why?
[20:24] You will have to keep it hidden,
[20:26] you won’t be able to use it in front of the owner,
[20:28] won’t you be ashamed.
[20:31] Hmmm…
[20:33] Child, things don’t matter,
[20:35] you find them, you lose them,
[20:38] you need to make relations,
be careful with them,
[20:41] you shouldn’t fall in anyone’s eyes.
[20:46] Mama,
[20:49] if the owner of that thing says that you found it,
[20:55] you keep it,
[20:56] then what should we do?
[20:59] This is the greatness of the owner,
[21:02] then you should keep it considering it a gift.
[21:05] Gift or alms?
[21:10] Charity?
[21:12] Yeah,
[21:15] but if the owner needs it more,
but they still give it to you,
[21:20] out of friendship,
[21:22] or sympathy or out of empathy,
[21:29] then its charity, right?
[21:32] Yes, that is true.
[21:35] Things given out of sympathy is charity.
[21:38] Rest God protect us
from charity from anyone,
[21:41] all your life you need to keep your head down
and favors are separate.
[21:46] God forgive us.
[22:32] Your heart may love you,
[22:35] but you are now Maheen’s.
[22:38] She is my friend and
I cannot steal her right.
[22:55] In front of the world your
 and my relation is hollow
[22:59] and your and Maheen’s relation is strong.
[23:04] Then why do we live in this hollow relation.
[23:07] We meet each other once a week like thieves,
[23:11] we talk to each other,
give each other hopes.
[23:14] What will we get out of it,
apart from defamation and blames.
[23:26] I don’t want it.
[23:29] I don’t want this love out of charity.
[23:33] I don’t want happiness given as alms.
[23:36] Who are you talking to?
[23:38] Huh?
[23:41] Pizza.
[23:42] Mama told me that you have not eaten,
so I got you pizza.
[23:47] No, brother. When I am hungry I will eat.
[23:49] eat it.
[23:50] Brother...
[23:51] here you go.
[23:51] Aunt has said I have gotten fat .
[23:53] Have it, have a little.
[23:55] I will eat. I will.
[24:01] What is the matter Mahi?
[24:05] There is something,
now won’t I recognize your mood?
[24:09] Huh?
[24:11] You have a long face and
why didn’t Umar come to get you?
[24:17] He has some work.
[24:19] Are you telling the truth?
[24:21] I mean, you have not come here
after fighting with Umar and aunt right?
[24:25] What am I asking and to whom am I asking.
[24:28] She cannot fight with anyone,
nor can she argue.
[24:32] She is really naïve.
[24:36] But if I fight one day, then?
[24:39] I am saying it cannot happen.
[24:41] You cannot get upset and
no one can get upset from you, for long.
[24:47] what if,
[24:48] one day I come home like this,
[24:52] just like that and I say that
I don’t want to go back,
[24:55] then what will you say?
[24:57] That, that is your home, live and die there.
[25:01] Will you drag me out of the home.
[25:03] So what are you doing?
[25:06] Okay, first, God forbid that this happens,
[25:10] but I can tell you, I will not do anything like this.
[25:14] Ok?
[25:15] I know my sister will not take a
step like this on something small,
[25:18] she is really patient
[25:20] and God forbid something like this happens,
[25:22] then this would mean
that something is there,
[25:26] that is out of my sister’s
patience and tolerance.
[25:29] I will test you just like that?
[25:31] We have married you,
[25:32] not cut you from us and thrown you away.
[25:34] Stupid.
[25:35] Come on eat.
[25:36] Listen, take out these weird
thoughts from your head
[25:39] and don’t think that I have left my brother,
mama and mother’s home far behind.
[25:44] We are with you even today,
just like pizza. Eat.
[26:36] Mama is stubborn like a child,
[26:39] she doesn’t see her illness,
[26:40] she just wants to fulfill
the flavor of her tongue.
[26:50] Greetings.
[26:51] Greetings.
[26:53] We have got all the tests done
 that you had asked for done.
[26:57] Then?
[26:58] By the grace of God,
Mansoor’s reports are normal.
[27:02] Thank God.
[27:05] And yours?
[27:07] My reports were normal earlier too,
they are normal now too.
[27:10] This means there is a delay from God,
[27:15] now a man cannot argue with God,
[27:18] whenever he wants, He will give us.
[27:21] Greeting.
[27:23] Greeting.
[27:26] No,
[27:27] there is no argument in this,
[27:30] God has kept a lot of ways open.
[27:34] If you and Mansoor,
[27:37] want to wait for two to four years with some hope,
 then that’s different.
[27:43] But if after two to four  years,
[27:46] God forbid, out of hopelessness
you have to decide this,
[27:49] then you make this decision right now.
[27:53] What decision?
[27:58] You get Mansoor married again.
[28:04] Its possible he might get a child out of
someone else’s fate and not mine.
[28:10] Najia?
[28:11] Mama, I am not saying
all this out of any pressure.
[28:16] The love I have for Mansoor,
[28:18] this is what it demands
[28:21] that I happily allow him to complete his life.
[28:27] Love is all about giving
[28:32] and if he being a man can say this to me,
[28:35] then why can’t I have
a big heart being a woman?
[28:43] You get him married.
[29:27] If this is what love demands,
[29:30] then I will live up to it.
[29:32] Love is the name of giving, right?
[30:16] Roshni was right,
[30:19] Maheen wanted this with her heart,
[30:23] it doesn’t matter to her
that to give her happiness,
[30:27] Roshni has made such a huge sacrifice.
[30:31] I am going through much torture
[30:33] and she is happy and satisfied.
[30:45] Will you iron all the clothes today?
[30:52] As many possible.
[30:54] Leave some for the morning aswell
[30:58] or you want to show off to the entire home
that you are efficient.
[31:07] Morning…
[31:13] you sleep.
[31:17] You seem really happy.
[31:20] Did you get your hands on some treasure
[31:25] or did Roshni give you something?
[31:29] Who knows, who gave whom what?
[31:35] You are sleepy Umar, you sleep.
[31:38] I am going to sleep.
[32:12] What was the need to say this to mama?
[32:16] I had to say it, so I said it.
[32:21] We had decided
[32:24] that we would stay with each other,
[32:27] whether complete or incomplete.
[32:32] A lot of people live with us in this home,
apart from us.
[32:35] You cannot ignore their wishes.
[32:39] Najia, its not in my hands to fulfill their wishes.
[32:43] You too don’t have the right to,
[32:44] or without asking me give
them this permission about me.
[32:50] Mansoor,
[32:52] I just gave her permission
so that she doesn’t feel that
[32:58] I am a hurdle in this route
[33:00] that wants to stop your life
from being complete.
[33:06] Now its her decision whether
she does this or not,
[33:11] or whether you support her
in this decision or not.
[33:15] I did my work
[33:18] and maybe with the belief that
[33:21] me giving permission or
not doesn’t matter,
[33:25] you won’t agree.
[33:29] Najia, you put the thought in her head,
[33:33] now she will pressurize me for no reason.
[33:37] It was a debt on me.
[33:40] Mansoor, she is your mother,
[33:43] whatever she does for you,
you can take it as your right.
[33:49] But being my mother in law,
she thought something for me,
[33:54] then it was compulsory
for me to say all this.
[34:30] What is the point of going to her
mother’s home every day?
[34:33] And look at her manners,
[34:35] she is not taking my permission,
[34:36] she is informing me,
[34:37] that too while standing,
[34:39] that I am going to my mother.
[34:40] I asked why,
[34:42] she didn’t answer and went inside.
[34:44] She is newly married,
girls get sad for their mother’s home.
[34:49] What do you mean the heart gets sad?
[34:51] Isn’t a month enough.
[34:54] After all, there is no custom that
allows you go to your mother’s home daily.
[34:58] I will talk to Umar, he has been lenient.
[35:01] Leave it Razia,
[35:03] let her go right now,
talk to her calmly later.
[35:06] I wish you were as lenient in my matters as you are
in the matters of your sons and daughter in laws.
[35:12] I was only allowed to go once in a month,
[35:15] after a lot of requests and pleading.
[35:18] Okay, I will remove this
complaint of yours today.
[35:22] Since you start competing with
mama’s behavior on everything,
[35:26] I am being this lenient for you.
[35:29] I break this rules for you.
[35:33] So many years have passed,
you have not forgotten this,
[35:36] the sorrow of your heart has not left,
[35:38] that mama was a tough mother in law for you.
[35:41] You complain about it daily,
mention it ten times during the day.
[35:46] What do you want Razia?
[35:49] That your daughters in law
also mention you the same way in future,
[35:53] like you mention mama?
[36:30] Umar.
[36:35] I am going to my mother’s home.
[36:40] No,
[36:42] I…
[36:44] I didn’t come here to ask you to drop me,
[36:47] I know you don’t like going there,
[36:51] I will ask Monis to pick me.
[36:57] You came from there yesterday only,
[36:59] if you go again, my mother will get upset.
[37:03] Let her be upset.
[37:12] Oh, so now my mother being
upset doesn’t matter to you.
[37:15] All the obedience was temporary?
[37:17] Everything was temporary,
[37:21] not strong enough,
[37:29] I am going to my home forever.
