[00:21] Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
[00:25] You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
[00:32] So you know this is Roshni’s action
[00:36] Obviously I know, man.
[00:38] I am so stupid, so idiotic,
[00:42] how did I believe that you said all this.
[00:45] My Maheen cannot do this?
[00:48] You cannot hurt anyone,
[00:50] nor cheat anyone, never.
[00:53] I know this.
[00:55] And most importantly,
[00:59] you can never stain our friendship,
[01:03] not today, nor tomorrow.
[01:07] Friendship?
[01:19] Yes, friendship.
[01:30] So, you know why Roshni said all this?
[01:37] Yes,
[01:39] I know it really well.
[01:42] I know you and her well.
[01:44] You are my friend,
[01:46] and she is my love.
[01:50] You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
[01:54] She is really stupid.
[01:57] You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
[02:03] Poor thing,
[02:06] she is also living up to her love
[02:08] and friendship with you too.
[02:11] She did all this for your ease,
[02:14] when she realized that
[02:16] you won’t be able to say anything in any way,
[02:19] so she said it,
[02:21] for your ease.
[02:22] Think about it.
[02:25] For my ease?
[02:28] Yes,
[02:30] now she is not even answering her phone.
[02:32] I have been trying her phone for so long.
[02:34] Since she found out
that you have come back,
[02:37] since then.
[02:39] She wants to get out from between us,
so that we stay happy.
[02:44] She is so stupid.
[02:48] She loves me after all,
[02:51] she is trying to live up to it.
[02:58] This is a weird situation.
[03:07] What happened?
[03:09] You didn’t get it?
[03:13] Maheen?
[03:20] Aunt is waiting for me.
[05:29] Maheen, you too stayed quiet?
[05:32] You didn’t even tell me this is Roshni’s action.
[05:40] So you know this is Roshni’s action?
[05:43] Obviously I know, man.
[05:46] I am so stupid, so idiotic,
[05:49] how did I believe that you said all this.
[05:53] My Maheen cannot do this?
[05:56] You cannot hurt anyone,
nor cheat anyone, never.
[06:01] I know this.
[06:03] And most importantly,
[06:06] you can never stain our friendship,
[06:10] not today, nor tomorrow.
[06:20] I know you and her well.
[06:22] You are my friend,
[06:24] and she is my love.
[06:27] You were only quiet because
you knew her intentions.
[06:32] She is really stupid.
[06:35] You know what, Maheen,
she just wants to see us happy somehow.
[06:40] Poor thing,
[06:43] she is also living up to her love
and friendship with you too.
[06:49] She did all this for your ease,
[06:53] when she realized that
[06:55] you won’t be able
to say anything in any way,
[06:57] so she said it,
[06:59] for your ease.
[07:01] Think about it.
[08:32] Maheen, grandma asked for this, give it to her.
[08:35] Okay.
[08:36] Listen.
[08:37] Yeah?
[08:42] You have forgiven me, right?
[08:47] What for?
[08:49] For letting me go for that blame?
[08:56] Or understanding Roshni correctly?
[09:02] Umar,
[09:04] where did this forgiveness come in between us?
[09:08] We are friends,
[09:10] were friends, and will stay friends.
[09:13] As far as Roshni is concerned,
[09:15] don’t worry, she will answer your phone.
[09:18] I will talk to her,
[09:21] that we are just friends,
[09:24] childhood friends.
[09:35] Save your scarf, Maheen.
[10:21] Roshni, please talk to me,
[10:24] how long will you run away from me like this?
[10:27] Will you going away like this,
bring distances between us?
[10:41] Distances have come in between us Umar,
[10:45] but its not just distances that are between us,
[10:49] but Maheen is also there.
[11:00] And Maheen must have told you everything.
[11:40] I know but I can understand you
have no fault in all this.
[11:48] You didn’t do anything with wrong intentions.
[13:07] Colors have been filled in the flowers,
[13:13] the season of spring is here.
[13:20] Come on so that the business runs.
[13:31] Colors have been filled in the flowers.
[13:39] Live long son.
[13:45] Aunt,
[13:46] all the work for the afternoon is done.
[13:49] And once the food is cooked,
can I go to mama’s home?
[13:52] If there is no other work.
[13:54] What other work will be there?
[13:56] But Mansoor and Umar have gone,
child, who will you go with?
[14:04] Anyway,
[14:05] when coming back,
[14:09] call Umar, he will pick you,
don’t come alone, ok?
[14:12] No, I will ask brother Monis,
he will drop me.
[14:16] Why? Do you have a problem with coming
and going with Umar?
[14:19] No it will be 7:30, by the time he comes,
[14:23] I don’t want to leave you
people alone for so long.
[14:26] I will just stay for an hour
or so and come back.
[14:30] I will give grandma her medication and go.
[14:33] Go safely child.
[14:38] She feels we don’t realize
that she is ignoring Umar.
[14:45] Razia, you thought like Umar’s mother, right?
[14:50] Its possible that
[14:53] she asked Umar to drop her and he said no.
[14:59] Put it down.
[15:02] I have my own glass in my hand.
[15:04] One minute.
[15:11] Give it to me.
[16:05] A friend should be like you,
[16:07] who got the news that
I came and she came to meet me.
[16:12] Did you get satisfied,
[16:15] is the burden on your heart lowered?
[16:16] Did you tell Umar everything?
[16:19] Now you must be waiting
when Umar will come to me,
[16:23] when he will talk to me,
when he separates from me.
[16:26] and he brings his broken heart to you,
[16:30] so that you console him.
[16:34] But this wait is useless,
[16:36] because the colors of my love are
so deep on Umar’s heart
[16:41] that he still doesn’t have a complaint from me.
[16:44] your game has turned around.
[16:48] The attempt would have gone to waste,
if I would have made an attempt.
[16:52] But I didn’t tell anything to Umar,
[16:55] you are being happy for no reason.
[16:59] You told him nothing?
[17:02] You were saying that
you would tell him the reality.
[17:07] Yes,
[17:09] but if I would have told him right now,
[17:12] what you just said would have happened.
[17:15] He would have come to me
with his broken heart,
[17:19] for me to console him.
[17:22] But I am not a bandage,
[17:24] nor am I a replacement,
[17:27] nor do I ever want to become that.
[17:41] Hello papa.
[17:42] Hello.
[17:44] Wow, you look really active today, great!
[17:48] I got tired of lying on the bed,
so I thought I would come outside.
[17:55] Okay, I will go meet mama.
[17:57] Najia,
[18:00] sit,
[18:02] I had to talk about something important to you.
[18:12] Yes?
[18:16] Child, I had talked to
Mansoor to question Umar,
[18:22] what he wants.
[18:23] I had asked you to check Maheen’s heart,
so what happened?
[18:27] Did he talk.
[18:29] No.
[18:31] actually papa its just me and
Mansoor who know the real thing,
[18:36] then what is the point in
questioning and searching?
[18:41] Real thing?
[18:43] What is that?
[18:46] Mansoor told me not to
talk to anyone about this,
[18:50] but now the situation
is such maybe I should say it.
[18:55] I would never say it, had the situation
between them would have been fine.
[18:59] No,
[19:00] you tell me,
[19:02] tell me everything.
[19:03] What issues do they have?
[19:07] They don’t have issues,
[19:09] they have a living, breathing personality.
[19:13] Umar likes someone.
[19:20] Now, back in the day,
[19:23] he married Maheen under the pressure of the situation
but he couldn’t end his contact.
[19:30] Even after marriage?
[19:33] Yes.
[19:36] And Maheen knows this.
[19:39] Obviously papa,
[19:41] how much can a girl tolerate.
[19:43] She cannot stop Umar
from staying away from her,
[19:45] so maybe that is why
she wants to go her separate way.
[19:53] But there is something else too papa,
[19:56] I don’t know if we should consider
Umar this wrong or not.
[20:00] Yes, what he did after the marriage,
that is wrong,
[20:05] that is cheating in Maheen’s entrustment.
[20:09] But if you see if from Umar’s perspective,
[20:13] even he has been mistreated.
[20:18] We are all involved in this mistreatment.
[20:25] And what will you call
what happened with Maheen?
[20:31] Injustice?
[20:33] Mistreatment?
[20:35] Or torment?
[21:07] Mama,
[21:08] where is Maheen?
[21:09] She is in her room, Roshni is also here.
[21:12] Okay, I got sweets for her,
I will give it to her myself.
[21:19] So you accepted your defeat?
[21:22] You realized that Umar can never be yours,
[21:25] he is mine and he will stay mine.
[21:36] As far as I know Umar, Roshni
[21:40] and I know Umar since childhood.
[21:44] When he finds out about you,
he will never live with you.
[21:49] But,
[21:51] I don’t want to pull him by telling him myself,
[21:55] when he finds out your reality himself,
and he will find out, then he will return.
[22:03] Then his return will actually be return.
[22:06] Umar now is my stubbornness,
[22:09] Maheen and I don’t lack options,
[22:12] I can get the best of the best,
[22:15] but only when I want.
[22:20] When I leave Umar.
[22:22] When I reject him.
[22:25] I will not let anyone take him away from me
[22:30] or if he wants to go away himself,
[22:33] because this is now a matter of my ego.
[22:51] Umar likes someone.
[22:54] Now, back in the day,
[22:56] he married Maheen under
the pressure of the situation
[22:59] but he couldn’t end his contact.
[23:03] Even after marriage?
[23:06] Yes.
[23:09] And Maheen knows this.
[23:12] Obviously papa,
[23:14] how much can a girl tolerate.
[23:16] She cannot stop Umar from staying away from her,
[23:20] so maybe that is why she wants
to go her separate way.
[23:35] I was worried for no reason till yesterday,
thinking what would happen.
[23:40] But trust me, I just found out there
is betterment in everything He does.
[23:44] Someone should have asked me too.
[23:45] Okay, we will ask you now,
[23:47] what will you wear at your wedding?
[23:49] You must have got your dirty jeans.
[23:51] Hey, you are always joking.
[23:52] Lower your voice. Lower your voice.
[23:54] Zakia and Monis were already thinking that
they might mistreat you in the matter of Maheen,
[23:58] if they hear you they won’t like it.
[24:00] Papa, no one cares about
what I might and not like.
[24:04] Someone ask me,
[24:05] I might have a plan,
[24:07] I might have something else in my head.
[24:14] Yes, this is a problem,
[24:16] it’s a worry,
[24:18] but because of this one worry a lot of other
worries have been brought into my life.
[24:25] But you should be happy papa,
[24:28] on the judgement day you will have your
head held high in front of uncle.
[24:32] The whole family is praising you,
[24:35] that your son is so obedient,
[24:38] he said yes to the wedding
when you asked him once.
[24:47] She doesn’t want your happiness,
comfort or peace.
[24:50] You forget her.
[24:51] What do you mean forget her?
[24:56] Look Umar,
whatever the issue is between you two,
[24:58] we will have you two seated in
front of us and listen to you two.
[25:02] What will you hear?
[25:05] Now what do you want to hear?
I heard what I had to.
[25:08] The truth is, she doesn’t like me,
she doesn’t want to live with me.
[25:12] that is it!
[25:17] I don’t know if we should consider
Umar this wrong or not.
[25:21] Yes, what he did after the marriage,
[25:23] that is wrong,
[25:25] that is cheating in Maheen’s entrustment.
[25:30] But if you see if from Umar’s perspective,
[25:33] even he has been mistreated.
[25:39] We are all involved in this mistreatment.
[25:45] And what will you call
what happened with Maheen?
[25:51] Injustice?
[25:53] Mistreatment?
[25:55] Or torment?
[26:37] Brother Monis,
[26:40] listen, if you are not busy,
then can you drop me home?
[26:43] You will not go anywhere now.
[26:45] No, its really late.
[26:47] In fact, do one thing,
call Umar and ask him to come here immediately.
[26:51] No brother,
[26:52] you know since the accident happened,
Umar has a lot of burden
[26:54] and he doesn’t get free before 8:00 pm
and I cannot stay here till then,
[26:57] aunt and uncle really need me.
[26:59] Those two are not your responsibility.
[27:02] Yes, if you are no one’s responsibility,
[27:04] then how can someone
else’s responsibility be yours?
[27:06] Will you call him or should I call him myself.
[27:08] What happened?
[27:10] I have to talk to him.
[27:11] About what?
[27:12] Exactly what I heard Roshni say right now.
[27:15] In fact, now we will talk face to face,
I will just go to uncle and hold Umar’s collar.
[27:19] No brother Monis,
[27:21] listen to me. listen to me.
listen to me, please.
[27:22] Please.
[27:23] You don’t do anything right now,
you are not going anywhere.
[27:25] Hear me out peacefully,
don’t do anything in your haste.
[27:28] Haste?
[27:30] Its already really late, Maheen,
[27:32] if I had not heard all this coincidentally
[27:34] then God knows how long you would
have hid Umar’s weaknesses from us.
[27:36] I was not hiding it from you people,
I was hiding it for our families,
[27:39] you have any idea if this becomes public,
all hell will break loose.
[27:42] Don’t talk like a child,
[27:43] you mean all torments
and pains are for my sister?
[27:46] Lower your voice, for God’s sake,
mama will hear you.
[27:47] Yes, mama will hear it, obviously,
[27:49] when this will come out in the open,
mama will hear it.
[27:50] In fact, this should be cleared today,
[27:54] I will take you and mama along and
stand in front of uncle and hold Umar’s collar.
[27:58] Fine. Fine. Fine.
[27:59] Hold his collar, I will come with you.
[28:01] But right now,
[28:02] for God’s sake hear me patiently,
just listen to me.
[28:04] Then we will go,
[28:05] we will go together.
[28:08] Come.
[28:16] Careful.
[28:17] Careful.
[28:18] Who is that damned girl?
[28:23] Who is it is not the issue,
[28:27] the issue is that she is in Umar’s life.
[28:30] Hey, how can she take over Umar’s life like that?
[28:33] The one who is married is part of your life,
[28:37] she is a stranger.
[28:39] Umar’s life,
[28:40] Umar’s future, everything is Maheen.
[28:45] The wedding is between two people,
[28:49] between two hearts and its not necessary.
[28:54] A wedding is an acceptance, a rule,
[28:58] the young generation doesn’t believe in any rules.
[29:04] And the one who has already
confessed his love to someone,
[29:11] will he give importance to the rules made later or
[29:15] the promises made earlier.
[29:17] Fareed, you are taking Umar’s side?
[29:21] You are giving justifications for his actions?
[29:25] I didn’t expect this from you.
[29:26] I am not taking his side.
[29:30] I am not taking his side,
[29:34] but I am not able to ignore it.
[29:39] It’s a weird difficulty, weird test.
[29:43] I don’t understand whose side to take,
[29:47] Umar’s or
[29:50] Maheen?
[29:51] Obviously,
[29:54] Maheen is the girl we got married in this home,
[29:59] our responsibility, our blood, our respect
[30:03] and most importantly Umar’s wife.
[30:07] Maheen has the most right on Umar.
[30:12] Instead of supporting Umar,
[30:16] we have to stop his feet
and make his home, Fareed.
[30:21] We need to make his home.
[30:29] And heart?
[30:32] Will that be made too?
[30:56] Come.
[31:02] Sit down.
[31:08] Okay, tell me now,
[31:09] what do you want to do?
[31:11] why do you want to hold his collar?
[31:13] I am your brother,
[31:15] I will take revenge for
the mistreatment you received.
[31:19] Why did he do all this with you?
[31:22] He did it?
[31:24] Think about it.
[31:27] Brother, did he come to you with a proposal?
[31:30] Or did he tell you and mama
that he will keep me happy.
[31:33] But this wedding was with his will,
he should have said no.
[31:36] Yes,
[31:37] this is his mistake,
[31:39] I accept and even he will accept.
[31:44] Then?
[31:45] Whatever he is doing with Roshni,
[31:47] everyone should be told about this,
he should get a little ashamed.
[31:51] Fine,
[31:52] we will embarrass him,
[31:55] then?
[31:57] Then what?
[31:59] Then what brother?
[32:01] If you embarrass him in front of everyone,
[32:06] will he start liking me instead of Roshni
[32:09] and if uncle and aunt are strict with him,
[32:13] then he will gain respect for me in his heart?
[32:15] So I be quiet like you?
[32:17] I don’t take revenge for the mistreatment you go.
[32:20] No, do it.
[32:23] But tell me, what will this achieve?
[32:30] You know something,
[32:33] if I want,
[32:36] I can force Umar to hate Roshni.
[32:43] But I don’t want to do that.
[32:45] But why Maheen? Why?
[32:47] Because this will not achieve anything brother.
[32:51] Hating Roshni doesn’t mean that…
[33:04] that he will start loving me.
[33:17] Even if I take out Roshni from his heart,
[33:20] there will be an empty space in his heart,
[33:23] and its not necessary that I will get that place.
[33:32] You don’t go Maheen,
[33:34] this home is for you,
[33:38] don’t go to the man
who doesn’t know your worth.
[33:41] I will have to go brother,
[33:43] for aunt,
[33:45] for grandma,
[33:47] for my uncle.
[33:49] I will go there and live as their child.
[33:54] Brother, I have left everything up to God.
[34:01] Listen to me,
[34:06] let what is happening, happen.
[34:11] Someone has to return,
[34:14] now the time will tell if it will be me, or Umar.
[34:21] So leave it.
[34:26] My lovely brother.
[34:29] I cannot tolerate it any further.
[34:30] No,
[34:33] leave it God.
[34:35] Come on sit.
[34:36] We won’t go to mama like this.
[35:16] Thank God you came.
[35:23] Why do you call me again and again?
[35:26] Can you live without me?
[35:29] You can,
[35:32] so live.
[35:33] Not at all.
[35:36] Roshni, life without you is no life.
[35:39] You know well,
I cannot live without you.
[35:42] I love you.
[35:45] Maheen is back,
[35:47] so what is the problem now?
[35:50] She didn’t come for me,
[35:53] she doesn’t love me at all, in fact,
[35:56] maybe she dislikes me.
[35:59] She really loves my family,
she returned for them.
[36:07] Forever?
[36:13] I mean,
[36:18] Umar for you and Maheen,
[36:21] I did all that I could,
[36:24] I had even decided to leave your life,
[36:28] but you didn’t let me leave.
[36:32] Then when Maheen left,
[36:36] without thinking or understanding anything,
I said so much about your family,
[36:42] because I knew Maheen wouldn’t
be able to do all this herself.
[36:46] Now she is back…
[36:50] I don’t know.
[36:55] But still,
[36:58] I will do what you tell me to.
[37:10] Roshni,
[37:12] just a little more wait.
[37:15] I will talk to papa this time.
[37:20] Will your father agree?
[37:24] I will think about this later
whether he agrees or not,
[37:28] right now I just have to talk him right now.
[37:33] Umar, I am scared,
[37:35] you will fall weak in your parents
and Maheen’s pressure.
[37:39] I know, this will happen.
