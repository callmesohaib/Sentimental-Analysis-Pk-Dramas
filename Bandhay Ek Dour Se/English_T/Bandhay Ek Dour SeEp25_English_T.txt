[00:40] Umar.
[00:42] Umar.
[00:42] What happened?
[00:43] Papa’s operation is successful,
he is out of danger.
[00:45] Thank God.
[00:50] Why are you people lying?
[00:52] Tell me honestly, how is he now?
[00:55] Aunt.
[00:55] He is fine.
[00:56] He is fine, trust me.
[00:58] The doctor said he will be fine,
our prayers worked.
[01:02] Oh God, thank you so much.
[01:10] But I,
[01:12] I have become a handicapped
and will be bed ridden.
[01:16] Hey mama,
why are you thinking like this?
[01:20] Death is better than such a life of handicap.
[01:23] Why are you saying these damned things, Razia.
[01:27] Don’t give me fake hope.
[01:31] Its better that
[01:32] God calls me to him instead of living on
someone’s support for the rest of my life.
[01:39] Aunt, the doctor said you will be fine,
you just need to rest.
[01:45] Don’t give me fake hope.
[01:49] Okay, I will do one thing,
I will call the doctor,
[01:51] he will tell you himself that
nothing happened to you, everything is fine.
[01:54] The doctor will say whatever you told him.
[01:58] I know I am not fine.
[02:02] Okay fine, go, call the doctor.
[02:09] Sister in law, what happened?
[02:11] Are you ok?
[02:13] I don’t know I just felt dizzy.
[02:15] Sit.
[02:15] Sit.
[02:23] I am fine, I will go and call the doctor.
[02:33] Umar,
[02:35] man, don’t worry,
uncle will regain consciousness,
[02:39] ok?
[02:41] I will go and drop Maheen and mama home,
then I will come back to you.
[02:46] No, you don’t need to come back, its ok.
[02:54] What happened sister in law?
Are you ok?
[02:56] What happened?
[02:57] Nothing, I just took her to the doctor,
[03:01] her BP is a little low,
she has not eaten anything since morning.
[03:04] I am fine.
[03:06] You take sister in law home,
[03:08] you go home and rest sister in law,
Grandma is alone at home too.
[03:12] No, who will stay with mama?
[03:15] I am here.
[03:17] No, its important for you to stay with papa.
[03:22] Najia, Umar is right, we cannot leave
grandma alone at home,
[03:27] you should stay at home with her,
[03:30] this way you will get to rest a little too.
[03:33] No,
[03:35] mama is really worried,
[03:37] and I don’t know why she feels
we are hiding something from her.
[03:41] I cannot leave her alone like this,
[03:43] someone has to stay
with her in this condition.
[03:46] I will stay.
[03:53] I will stay with aunt,
you go home and rest sister in law.
[04:28] Papa.
[04:34] Papa.
[04:38] Please open your eyes,
[04:40] talk to me.
[04:51] Forgive me papa.
[04:56] Forgive me.
[04:58] I have really bothered you.
[05:04] I will not do it again.
[05:09] I promise you,
I will accept anything you say,
[05:13] I will not go against
any decision you take for me.
[05:18] Please forgive me.
[05:23] Just open your eyes,
[05:25] papa, I am dying to hear your voice.
[05:29] Forgive me.
[05:32] Forgive me.
[05:43] Umar.
[05:47] Father.
[06:12] Thank God papa regained consciousness.
[06:15] Yes.
[06:17] You know I am fine now,
[06:19] if you want to go back to the hospital, you can.
[06:24] Sure?
[06:25] Yes, yes.
[06:26] Its not that I didn’t stay there 
because I was unwell,
[06:30] I came home because of another reason.
[06:32] What is that?
[06:35] Umar and Maheen are alone there,
[06:38] we should give them some time.
[06:40] In this time of sorrow,
[06:42] a person becomes more sensitive
[06:45] and it’s possible that to take Umar’s sorrow,
[06:48] she comes near him
[06:50] and the distances between them reduce.
[06:54] Yes, you are right.
[06:58] Then I too should stay here tonight.
[07:02] I pray to God this happens.
[07:04] Yeah.
[07:42] Yes, hello.
[07:43] Sorry,
[07:45] I was not able to respond,
[07:48] I was not in my senses.
[07:49] I am still at the hospital.
[07:51] Yes, so?
[07:53] I was calling you to ask if everything is fine,
[07:56] I don’t want to chit chat with you.
[07:58] Yes, man,
 I know this is what is worrying you,
[08:02] but I am just in a condition 
that I was not in my senses,
[08:07] so I couldn’t reply to your messages.
[08:11] Were you not in your senses, 
or Maheen made you lose your senses?
[08:16] Maheen?
[08:19] She is there, right?
[08:20] With you, near you.
[08:23] There is no one with me or near me,
[08:26] and I felt that you are with me,
[08:29] but are you worried about Maheen at this time,
[08:31] you are asking me this.
[08:33] I mean…
[08:36] Hello.
[08:37] Hello, Umar.
[08:39] Hello.
[08:42] Roshni. Roshni. Roshni.
[08:45] Why does your tongue not stop?
[08:48] Now was this something to say?
[09:31] Mama, must have pricked her heart 
 with her taunts and sarcasm.
[09:36] Razia,
[09:37] she didn’t even talk properly,
[09:40] Neither with me nor her.
[09:42] Fine mama, if she stays there for a few days,
[09:44] their anger will diminish and 
I think a little has already been removed too.
[09:48] I pray to God.
[09:51] My God is witness,
[09:53] I have nothing against brother 
or Razia in my heart.
[09:57] Small arguments happen with the in-laws,
[10:01] but I am not that thankless,
[10:03] that I forget all of favors brother did to us,
[10:06] that he did to us after his brother left us.
[10:09] May God give him a long life.
[10:13] Amen.
[10:22] Aunt, have this.
[10:25] Have this soup quickly,
 then you need to take your medication.
[10:32] You won’t eat with my hands.
[10:38] I know you are upset with me,
[10:41] you are angry,
[10:43] but aunt,
[10:45] just for a few days,
[10:47] forget your anger.
[10:48] Just for a few days,
[10:49] then gladly don’t talk to me afterwards.
[10:54] Because I am now handicapped,
[10:57] I am at your mercy,
[11:00] so I forget what you have said about us.
[11:13] No, God forbid you become handicapped,
[11:16] but you heard what the doctor said,
[11:20] you need to rest right now,
[11:25] you need rest and its essential that
 you take your medication on time,
[11:29] and for that having food is important,
[11:31] so you eat right now, 
and don’t talk to me later.
[11:34] Don’t bother me Maheen,
[11:38] I see your face,
[11:41] remember the hope with which your 
uncle came to convince you,
[11:50] he said he would come back with you.
[11:57] But see,
[12:00] what happened to him.
[12:05] If God forbid,
[12:07] God forbid, something happened to him,
[12:10] would you ever be able to forgive yourself?
[12:47] Are you going to the hospital?
[12:50] Yes,
[12:52] is there some work?
[12:55] This tiffin box, can you take this?
[12:59] All ok?
[13:00] How did you suddenly think of making breakfast 
and sending it to the hospital?
[13:07] I was thinking of going 
to the hospital since night,
[13:10] I thought I would make something and send it.
[13:12] Meaning, you too had to go to the hospital?
[13:17] Why?
[13:18] Can I not go to the hospital?
[13:20] Maheen has been here for a week,
 you didn’t come to meet her,
[13:24] will you go to the hospital to meet her in-laws?
[13:29] You know, this change is great?
[13:33] How long will this last for?
[13:35] Give me an idea.
[13:36] Going to meet someone who is ill is not a sin and 
what did I say that you are so shocked to hear?
[13:43] Do one thing either go 
feed your mother this breakfast,
[13:47] or go inside, my mother is there, feed her this.
[13:50] But really,
[13:52] she too will be surprised on this 
action of making breakfast of yours.
[13:56] Go and check.
[14:28] Is Monis here?
[14:32] Yeah.
[14:34] He went inside to meet papa.
[14:37] Tell him to take me when he goes.
[14:41] That’s it?
[14:42] You met them, its over?
[14:46] Your duty is complete?
[14:48] Oh, in fact,
[14:49] there is no obligation on you,
[14:53] you just came to live up to
 the expectations of the world.
[14:58] Okay,
[15:00] at least I lived up to the world’s expectation,
[15:04] you couldn’t live up to anything.
[15:35] Hello.
[15:36] How is Fareed?
[15:38] Did he regain consciousness?
[15:42] Tell me, did you meet him?
[15:44] You should have apologized, 
he is your elder.
[15:47] Why are you sitting with your lips sealed, 
why don’t you answer me?
[15:49] How is he?
[15:52] Mama, you are going,
[15:54] you see how he is.
[15:57] So you didn’t meet him.
[16:02] What is wrong with you, Maheen?
[16:04] You were never this rude and ill-mannered, 
after all he is your uncle.
[16:10] I am not rude or ill mannered,
[16:13] I am embarrassed.
[16:16] How do I go meet him?
[16:18] I felt embarrassed.
[16:50] Umar,
[16:53] I know you must not have ate or 
drank anything since last night,
[16:58] so I made sandwiches and
 tea for you from home and go them.
[17:04] Thank you.
[17:06] Sit.
[17:12] Thank you.
[17:16] Umar,
[17:21] I am really sorry.
[17:24] I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that at night,
[17:28] your parents are suffering so much, 
and you are in so much difficulty,
[17:32] and I am…
[17:34] I am really bad.
[17:37] Don’t say that Roshni.
[17:40] You have no idea, 
you coming here has made me stronger.
[17:45] Having you here with me,
[17:48] I am really happy.
[17:54] I don’t see Maheen.
[18:02] She has left.
[18:04] She left?
[18:09] I felt she must have given up her stubbornness.
[18:15] Talking to papa, seeing his face,
[18:18] she didn’t even bother going near him.
[18:22] He loves her so much,
[18:23] not from today, but since forever.
[18:26] Not as a daughter in law but as a daughter.
[18:32] Why did all this happen?
[18:35] Mama and papa were going to convince her.
[18:39] Yeah,
[18:40] leave it Umar,
[18:42] some people are like that,
[18:44] who don’t care for love,
[18:47] nor can they keep someone’s regard.
[18:52] You are right.
[18:58] Anyway,
[19:00] thank you.
[19:05] I think you should go inside and sit with mama,
[19:09] if someone sees us alone like this,
[19:12] I mean you understand, right?
[19:15] I will go,
[19:18] let me look at you properly.
[19:22] Its so weird Umar,
[19:25] that the one who has a right on you,
[19:29] she doesn’t like spending time with you and me,
[19:32] the one who dies to spend two moments with you,
[19:39] you fear the world might see us.
[19:47] Anyway,
[19:50] you take care,
[19:52] I am with you.
[20:11] Forgive me Monis,
[20:13] I didn’t know the matter was so serious.
[20:15] Did I say something to you?
[20:17] You didn’t say anything, 
that is why I am worried.
[20:20] I wish you had said something to me.
[20:22] Monis, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
[20:25] Monis, I came running just now too
[20:27] but when I came here I found out that
[20:30] aunt has left
[20:35] and you have no idea how worried I am.
[20:41] I don’t how for how long
 will our wedding be delayed,
[20:45] how will I see all this,
[20:46] how will I do it all.
[20:49] You know sister coming over will be an issue too.
[20:52] You don’t understand what I am saying, 
how do I explain it to you?
[20:55] You are worried about your wedding,
[20:57] here my sister’s married 
life is having problems.
[21:00] I am seriously scared by the name of wedding.
[21:07] A new problem has started.
[21:08] What?
[21:10] What did you say?
[21:11] I said how long will you be afraid?
[21:14] We have to get married
[21:16] and one day we will get married.
[21:19] I come to your home just like that,
[21:21] my mother has to answer for that.
[21:24] The neighbors have eyes
[21:29] and yes,
[21:32] if you want to change your 
mind about marrying me,
[21:35] then tell me beforehand,
[21:39] because my uncle doesn’t have 
a son who will be my support.
[21:46] Bye.
[21:56] Hey mother, it is about the being
 on good terms with the locality
[21:59] and then we care about relations too
[22:01] and after all Maheen is not my Roshni’s friend,
 she is like a sister to her,
[22:06] so how is it possible that
 I don’t come to meet his mother and father in law.
[22:11] The one who has a relation doesn’t realize this.
[22:14] No its not that Razia,
[22:17] Maheen has not stopped crying since yesterday.
[22:20] Since she heard the news, 
you have no idea what  condition she is in.
[22:27] Aunty, eat something, 
you will regain health sooner.
[22:32] No child.
[22:34] Sister, Zakia is absolutely right,
[22:36] I have always heard
Maheen praise you people.
[22:41] She is a loving and caring child.
[22:46] Aunty, should I fix your hair?
[22:51] Thank you child.
[22:53] Sister, Maheen is a child,
[22:56] she is naïve,
[22:57] but trust me, she is good at heart.
[23:00] In fact, my Roshni is short tempered,
[23:04] at times she argues with me,
[23:07] she fights with the people in the locality too,
[23:09] but I swear I have never heard 
Maheen talk in a loud voice.
[23:14] I often give Roshni, Maheen’s example, 
to learn something from her.
[23:23] Mama, the rickshaw is here, 
shall we go?
[23:26] Or else we will get late.
[23:29] Okay we will leave now.
[23:32] Take care.
[23:33] Thank you so much.
[23:35] Bye.
[23:35] Bye.
[23:38] Bye aunty.
[23:56] No, that’s it.
[24:23] Maheen is so good,
[24:25] that I swear that she won’t complain 
and I give Roshni, examples of Maheen.
[24:32] You really love talking negative about me.
[24:35] you just need an opportunity,
[24:37] you highlight my shortcomings in front of everyone.
[24:40] What is wrong with you?
[24:42] You are making noise since you came, 
what are you shouting about?
[24:45] what negativity did I highlight about you,
[24:47] I was just cleaning Maheen’s
mother in law’s heart from her.
[24:50] Yeah,
[24:54] are you her lawyer?
[24:56] Or are you her mother?
[24:57] Her mother was sitting there, 
she could have said all this herself.
[25:01] Mama, you went there to ask how she was,
[25:05] you should have done that and returned.
[25:07] What was the need to praise Maheen?
[25:10] Have you gone mad?
[25:13] You are being upset on useless things.
[25:16] Now I will ask you before I talk?
[25:18] Hey, what I thought was right, I said it.
[25:21] You are here to give me suggestion.
[25:24] You do your work,
 focus on your work, you talk a lot.
[25:29] I am not doing it.
[25:30] I knew it,
[25:32] these are all excuses to not work.
[25:35] You have become lazy,
[25:36] you didn’t have to work 
so you will get upset on these things.
[25:41] If this is how you will be, 
you will never get married.
[25:45] See Maheen,
[25:46] poor thing, she is so naïve,
[25:48] she too sitting at her mother’s home.
[25:50] And you?
[25:51] Someone as short tempered as you,
[25:53] who will be able to live with you?
[26:01] You only know this.
[26:10] My feet are swollen sitting down.
[26:15] I have sat for four hours,
[26:17] but Razia didn’t talk to me properly.
[26:19] Thank God mama was not there
[26:21] or else she would have insulted me so much.
[26:27] Maheen,
[26:29] since you have been born,
[26:30] you have never hurt me a little,
[26:33] I have always had comfort from you.
[26:36] This is the first time, 
I have been so embarrassed because of you.
[26:40] So many people came while I was there,
[26:43] they all saw that Razia was not talking to me.
[26:45] I got so embarrassed.
[26:50] Mama, you shouldn’t have gone.
[26:52] How could I not go?
[26:52] They are not just my in-laws,
 They are my daughter’s in-laws too.
[26:56] Forget that its my in-laws.
[26:58] Stop this nonsense Maheen.
[26:59] Do I even forget that
 its your father’s brother’s home?
[27:02] Should I forget blood relations?
[27:04] If not the world,
[27:05] should I forget fearing God too?
[27:09] Razia spoke more to Roshni and her mother,
[27:12] as compared to me, 
although they went there cause of you.
[27:15] Roshni?
[27:17] Yes, both mother and 
daughter came in a rickshaw, to find out.
[27:22] But there is something in today’s time,
who lives up to the relation of neighbors?
[31:28] I have to go there daily, I am helpless.
[31:30] And when I go there, 
I have to get embarrassed daily
[31:33] and look at her stubbornness.
[31:35] Brother was asking even today, 
won’t Maheen come to see me?
[31:40] Mama,
[31:42] why does Roshni go there every second day?
[31:46] Was she there today too?
[31:47] I see her daily.
[31:53] Why does she go there?
[31:57] I am asking you something.
[31:57] I don’t know.
[31:59] You ask her.
[32:02] She must go because of her,
[32:04] the tears in her eyes have dried.
[32:05] I am telling you Monis, 
her actions are not those of fixing her home.
[32:08] But I need an answer to my questions.
[32:09] Okay. Stop.
[32:10] What reason?
[32:11] What relation does she go there with?
[32:12] Being Maheen’s friend?
[32:14] But she doesn’t consider them their own.
[32:16] she doesn’t participate in their pain and sorrow,
[32:18] but why is Roshni always there in place of Maheen,
[32:20] I want to know this.
[32:21] Okay, come on. Stop now. Come on.
[32:38] Najia.
[32:40] Hey, coming.
[32:41] Najia.
[32:42] Come on.
[32:43] Careful. Careful. Careful.
[32:44] Hello mama.
[32:46] Hello.
[32:47] Take her. Take her. Take her to the bed.
[32:49] Careful.
[32:52] Thank God.
[32:54] Come mama.
[32:55] Walk slowly. Slowly.
[32:57] Hey, I am also not used to this.
[33:00] No practice.
[33:02] Hold this.
[33:03] Hold my hand.
[33:04] Careful child. Careful.
[33:06] Give it to me. give it.
[33:07] Thank God.
[33:13] Take this Mansoor,
[33:15] give this to someone.
[33:16] Yes.
[33:17] Put a pillow under my leg.
[33:18] I will keep it.
[33:23] The big one, keep this.
[33:28] Keep it.
[33:32] That’s it. That’s it. No. remove it.
[33:38] Thank God I am back to my home.
[33:42] Are you happy now?
[33:44] You are back home after so many days,
[33:46] God has given you a new life.
[33:49] I will be happy the day their father comes home.
[33:55] May God just give him health soon.
[33:59] By the will of God, papa will be 
with us in two to four days.
[34:03] By the will of God.
[34:04] By the will of God. By the will of God.
[34:15] Hey,
[34:16] are you people this happy on me coming back
 or is there another reason for the happiness?
[34:23] No, no mama,
[34:24] we are really happy that you are back,
[34:26] and…
[34:28] Hey, when Mansoor tells you,
[34:31] when he gives you the good news, 
you will get real happiness.
[34:36] Mama,
[34:39] God has answered your prayers.
[34:42] Your wish is fulfilled.
[34:45] Najia is pregnant.
[34:47] What?
[34:50] What are you saying?
[34:51] Oh God, thank you.
[34:54] How do I thank God?
[34:57] Hey Najia, come here.
[34:59] Go.
[35:02] Congratulations to you child.
[35:07] What are you doing standing there?
[35:08] Go get sweets, 
I will distribute them to the locality…
[35:12] in fact, I will distribute it to the whole family.
[35:14] Go get it.
[35:15] No. no. no. no.
[35:18] No need to spread the word,
[35:21] first child is always hard, 
after two or two and a half months pass,
[35:26] then you can tell everyone, not right now.
[35:29] Fine mama. Fine.
[35:31] Mama, this is the fruit of your 
and grandma’s prayers,
[35:36] when we were even disappointed with the doctor,
[35:40] God showered his blessings suddenly.
[35:43] Come here. Come here.
[35:44] Yes.
[36:00] You eat really little, okay bring it fast man.
[36:04] I am seeing you so happy 
and relaxed after so many days.
[36:08] Yes,
[36:10] mama will come home from the hospital.
[36:13] Thank God.
[36:14] Papa will be home in a few days too.
[36:17] Roshni,
[36:20] you have really supported me in these days.
[36:23] You were my support.
[36:26] Thank you.
[36:29] You know,
[36:31] your mother spoke with me with so much love,
[36:34] for the first time.
[36:35] Really?
[36:36] Earlier, she considered me Maheen’s friend, 
she didn’t give me much importance.
[36:41] But then she started talking to me so lovingly.
[36:46] You know I have made your work easy.
[36:50] What work?
[36:51] Hey,
[36:53] now if you talk about me at your home,
[36:55] then you will not have to convince them a lot,
[36:58] because they have started to
 like me a little from the start.
[37:04] Yes, but
[37:09] it won’t be right to talk about 
this in the current situation. Right?
[37:12] Hey, this is the right time.
[37:15] When you spoke to them earlier 
about the second wedding,
[37:18] that was the wrong time,
[37:19] this is the right time.
[37:21] You talk about it again, please.
[37:31] I am really happy.
