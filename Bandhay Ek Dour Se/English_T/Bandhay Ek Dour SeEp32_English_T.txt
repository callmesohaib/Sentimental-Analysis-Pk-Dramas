[00:39] Grandma, all ok?
You have not slept till now.
[00:43] You go and sleep,
[00:45] I am waiting for Umar.
[00:46] Go.
[01:15] Umar, wait a minute. Wait.
[01:16] Brother, what happened?
[01:17] Go up from here.
[01:19] Brother, I will listen to your lectures tomorrow,
I am tired, I want to go inside.
[01:22] Hey, I am not that sad for you Umar
[01:25] that I take you along with me
and have you sit with me,
[01:27] but you don’t go inside from this way,
[01:29] go upstairs,
[01:30] then in the morning take the other way home.
[01:33] What happened?
[01:35] The situation is not good for you,
I am saying it to save you.
[01:41] I will see the situation myself,
[01:43] what will happen?
[01:44] Mama and papa will curse me at the most,
[01:47] they will scold me, insult me, I will hear it.
[01:49] Hey, listen to me. Umar.
[01:52] Umar.
[01:56] Umar, come here.
[01:57] Come here.
[01:59] You, how dare you? 
What are you doing?
[02:01] Grandma.
Grandma, have you gone mad?
[02:02] I will get hurt.
[02:03] Hey you move.
[02:04] Have you gone mad?
[02:07] Leave him grandma.
[02:08] You will get married again!
Have I gone mad?
[02:10] He will get hurt.
[02:10] Umar, you leave from here.
[02:12] Go from here. Umar, go upstairs.
Leave him grandma, he made a mistake.
[02:15] You think I am mad.
[02:15] Leave him grandma, we will sit and talk.
[02:17] Leave me.
[02:17] Grandma, calm down. Sit down.
[02:18] He doesn’t care about his ill parents.
[02:21] He will get married again,
[02:23] And keep two wives.
[02:25] He is really young.
[02:26] Look at him.
[02:27] Grandma, we will sit and talk.
Your blood pressure will shoot up.
[02:29] What is there to talk about?
[02:30] What will I talk about?
Go talk to him, make him understand.
[02:34] Sit calmly and then we can talk.
[02:35] What happened? You come. Come.
[02:37] Move.
[02:41] Oh man.
[04:00] I had told you earlier,
you should have come upstairs
[04:01] and saved yourself from getting beaten.
[04:05] Does it hurt?
[04:07] You know, grandma has a heavy hand.
[04:09] Please,
[04:11] you leave me alone for a little while.
[04:18] Is it her?
[04:22] You know, there is something,
[04:26] one minute,
[04:28] is Najia standing there and listening?
[04:33] These extramarital affairs have an advantage,
[04:39] when a person is getting insulted at home,
[04:42] he can get bandage done from outside.
[04:43] Please man!
[04:45] Hey, I was joking to uplift your mood.
[04:48] uplift my mood?
[04:49] What will I do by being ok,
when nothing else is getting fixed.
[04:54] When you have put your hand in the bee hive,
then face all this.
[04:59] This much hell had to be raised
[05:02] and now more will happen
if you stay strong on what you have said,
[05:07] obviously, this thing will get out of the house,
[05:09] you will have to listen to a lot more,
[05:11] you are already worried.
[05:16] I am worried thinking about something else.
[05:21] What?
[05:24] Tell me something,
[05:28] why is she doing all this?
[05:31] What all this?
[05:35] Why is she supporting me?
[05:38] why is she helping me?
[05:40] why is she taking my side in front of everyone?
[05:43] Why is she doing all this?
[05:46] I can answer this question,
[05:51] but I want that you find
the answer for this question yourself,
[05:56] ask yourself.
[06:01] Is it friendship or sympathy?
[06:04] Look for it.
[06:05] Look for it, look for the answer, Umar.
[06:08] You will find it.
[06:10] I know
[06:12] but I want that you find out yourself.
[06:19] Good luck!
[07:09] Grandma,
[07:15] breakfast.
[07:17] I don’t want breakfast by your hand.
[07:18] Take it from here.
[07:20] Take it from here.
[07:21] Who do you want to be fed breakfast?
[07:23] By the hands of Umar’s second wife.
[07:26] Go call her.
[07:28] You really want to see Umar married again.
[07:35] Grandma,
[07:38] you have such a big heart,
[07:40] then why did you react on this thing?
[07:43] Make some place in your heart.
[07:46] Look Maheen, this is my heart,
[07:49] not a rented home, 
that I give anyone place.
[07:52] You are being smart and 
giving your grandmother suggestions.
[07:55] Look if you bother me more,
[07:57] I will tell your mother.
[08:01] Tell her.
[08:02] Yes,
[08:04] when you don’t care about your mother in law,
[08:06] your husband,
[08:08] your grandma,
[08:09] then why would you be scared of your mother?
[08:12] Let it be girl. Let it be.
[08:15] Umar won’t let it be, grandma.
[08:20] You will stop him from marrying,
[08:22] but you cannot stop him from meeting that girl.
[08:27] How long will you stop him from marriage?
[08:30] He will do what he wants one day.
[08:34] Instead of him doing it secretly,
[08:36] won’t it be better all this
 is done by your agreement.
[08:40] If this is done in front of you, grandma,
[08:44] a lot of relations will be saved from breaking.
[09:14] Why did you wake up so early?
[09:16] Rest a little more.
[09:20] Did you find out anything,
[09:22] who is the girl that Umar wants to marry.
[09:24] Najia,
[09:26] I better not hear anything like this from you.
[09:29] Great,
[09:30] if the family talks about it, its fine,
[09:32] if I talk about it you mind it.
[09:36] Najia, no one is happy with this decision of Umar,
[09:40] now if you repeat it again and again,
 then mama and papa won’t like it.
[09:44] Fine, I won’t repeat it,
[09:46] but when he brings her as his second wife,
[09:48] everyone will know.
[09:49] The youngest of the family 
are creating a great example.
[09:52] Okay, lower your voice.
[09:57] I agree whatever Umar is doing is wrong,
[10:00] but what can we do?
[10:03] What do you mean?
[10:04] We can do something for Maheen,
[10:08] that poor thing, faced with sorrow.
[10:10] Her family doesn’t 
ask her how she is, nor do we.
[10:13] Please Mansoor, do something.
[10:19] I even called aunt yesterday.
[10:22] Monis spoke to me and cut the call.
[10:25] Why are you adding fuel to the fire?
[10:28] I am telling you to stay away from this matter,
[10:32] we will see what happens.
[10:36] Right now, I am worried more 
for mama and papa, then Umar.
[10:42] Maheen too is supporting Umar,
[10:44] I have never seen such a wife ever before.
[10:47] What can she do?
[10:49] she has to be involved 
in her husband’s happiness.
[10:56] Okay, I am going to the office,
[10:58] I have made breakfast for you, ok?
[11:00] Have breakfast. Okay?
[11:02] Thank you.
[11:03] Okay.
[11:04] Take care.
[11:19] Umar will not learn Razia.
[11:23] What he has to do secretly,
[11:27] if he does it with our agreement a lot of 
relations will be saved from breaking.
[11:32] Does it hurt?
[11:36] Will he marry by his will?
[11:46] Yes,
[11:47] he is young,
[11:51] he is of age and independent too.
[11:57] He has even told us of the favor
 he did to us by sacrificing on our will.
[12:06] I am afraid of the day,
[12:12] Razia when my son stands 
in front of me and blames me,
[12:18] shows his favor that
[12:22] he killed his heart’s wishes for my happiness,
[12:29] that is the reason.
[12:30] And Maheen?
[12:32] Did you not think about her even once?
[12:36] I am thinking about her, 
that is why I am unable to decide.
[12:40] Let me think. Let me think.
[12:45] Whatever the decision is,
[12:49] it will have Maheen’s betterment by the will of God.
[13:19] Umar,
[13:20] meet me once so that I can tell you
 that I didn’t want to hurt you.
[13:27] I am going through so much for you,
[13:29] and you cannot go 
through this much for me.
[13:31] At least meet me.
[13:36] Where are you going?
[13:37] Market.
[13:38] I will also come along.
[13:41] Mama, on the way back I have to go to my friend.
[13:46] Fine, I too will meet your friend and her brother.
[13:51] Mama...
[13:53] Why? What happened?
[13:55] Listen to me.
[13:58] Look,
[13:59] if those people have a 
problem bringing a proposal,
[14:02] I will go talk to her mother myself.
[14:05] I will tell her that 
she has a daughter in her home
[14:09] and her son is defaming
 my daughter in the whole city.
[14:13] What defamation, mama?
[14:16] Now you are making noise and 
defaming me yourself, that is different.
[14:19] Roshni,
[14:21] you won’t go anywhere.
[14:23] If that man brings a proposal for you
 in a week to ten days, then fine
[14:27] or else
[14:29] I will fix your wedding with Mr. Haji’s son,
[14:32] after all, he has been
 begging me for a few days.
[14:35] Is that fat man only left for me?
[14:38] A family of seven to eight brothers and sisters,
[14:40] I don’t want to get in so much rush.
[14:42] Really?
[14:43] If you don’t want to go there,
[14:45] then tell your friend to bring her 
brother’s proposal for you,
[14:49] that won’t happen.
[14:51] He won’t bring a proposal.
[14:53] Because such men only 
take you around the city,
[14:56] but no one makes you
 the respect of their home, Roshni.
[15:00] Mama,
[15:01] I am going to meet my friend, not him.
[15:06] And what you want,
[15:08] I will say it all.
[15:09] No,
[15:11] because I will say all this myself
 and in my own words.
[15:16] I will go with you right now.
[15:18] Mama,
[15:19] so that their intention of bringing the proposal
 that too ends because of your bitter talk.
[15:24] Why do you want to ruin everything?
[15:29] Look, he is not a bad man,
[15:32] he will come soon with his parents,
[15:36] you have trusted me so much,
[15:39] just trust me a little more, please.
[15:46] I’ll go and,
[15:48] Come back quickly.
[15:51] Bye.
[16:12] Its been so many days,
[16:14] we have not gone to find out 
how brother and Razia are.
[16:17] If you come early today,
[16:19] then let’s go in the evening?
[16:21] I will get late, mama.
[16:23] Then tomorrow?
[16:25] Do one thing, go today,
 what if I don’t get time in future or not.
[16:29] Why do I feel you don’t want to go there.
[16:34] Think that.
[16:36] Did you mind anything Razia said?
[16:38] You know her temperament and she is on the bed 
and it has made her short tempered.
[16:44] I don’t even pay heed to anything she says.
[16:47] Now that is my daughter’s in-laws house,
or else I used to insult her a lot.
[16:52] If it’s the in-laws so what?
[16:53] Should we listen to everything wrong they say?
[16:56] The daughter stays their, 
lives with her in-laws.
[17:02] Earlier your life’s mission was 
that she gets married,
[17:05] where ever she gets married, to anyone.
[17:07] Now your life’s mission is that
 the daughter lives with her in-laws.
[17:10] No one thinks in all this 
what Maheen is going through.
[17:15] Hey, what is she going through? 
Someone tell me.
[17:17] Have things not been fixed?
[17:19] I thought she must have cared for
 her mother in law, and won her heart.
[17:23] Razia’s mood will be fine.
[17:24] That’s it,
[17:25] we sent her there so that she can serve them.
[17:51] You have a problem meeting me now.
[17:56] Please Roshni, nothing like that.
[18:00] I am really worried,
[18:02] you know it all
[18:05] and I don’t want that
 I meet you in this worry,
[18:09] for no reason you too will be tensed.
[18:12] So do I have any less tension?
[18:14] There is such a good proposal at home,
[18:17] the family is pressurizing me.
[18:21] Now don’t say that
 I say yes to that proposal.
[18:25] I will feel you are getting rid of me,
[18:31] that is why I said that to you,
[18:34] because I know that you are tensed, 
your family is pressurizing you,
[18:40] insulting you, I realize that.
[18:44] Look,
[18:45] I was just saying that you…
[18:51] I what?
[18:54] You said yourself
[18:56] that your friendship with Maheen is the same,
[19:00] then ask Maheen as a friend 
who she likes and who is in her heart.
[19:09] Please, Roshni?
[19:10] Look, listen to me,
[19:12] this way you alone won’t be blamed,
[19:15] you can tell your family 
that Maheen’s will was in it,
[19:18] because Maheen likes someone else.
[19:22] Roshni, please…
[19:24] No Umar, listen to me,
[19:26] you ask Maheen for 
whom is she doing all this.
[19:30] Stop it Roshni,
[19:33] you know Maheen well and so do I.
[19:40] Maheen is not such a girl,
[19:42] she is not that girl, you know.
[19:44] She is not like that sort of girl,
[19:48] so this means I am that sort of a girl.
[19:51] No.
[19:52] You want to say this,
[19:54] right that I am such a girl and she is not.
[19:57] Roshni…
[19:58] This is the limit.
[20:00] The limit.
[20:03] Roshni.
[20:06] Roshni.
[20:13] I didn’t expect this from Mr. Fareed,
[20:15] that he would stay under
 the pressure of his children in this age.
[20:19] All his life he kept the eye of
 a tiger on his children.
[20:23] Hey, along with papa, 
Mansoor too has a soft corner,
[20:27] he is also supporting Umar.
[20:30] The whole family is ready to get beaten,
[20:35] where is Fareed?
[20:35] Call him, I will ask him what is the fear 
that he has from his son?
[20:39] When he has to answer in front of the family,
[20:42] what will we say?
[20:44] Grandma, leave everything,
[20:46] lets go to that girl’s home 
and insult her there.
[20:49] Yes, that’s right,
[20:51] before we get insulted in our family,
[20:54] we should insult her so much that 
she is unable to show her face in public.
[20:58] Mama, who is that damned girl?
[21:00] Maheen knows, but she won’t tell us.
[21:04] Mansoor must know, 
I will make him tell us.
[21:08] You tell Fareed,
[21:09] to find out from Umar.
[21:11] Umar won’t tell him.
[21:13] Hey, tell him that 
we are here to fix the wedding,
[21:17] if he tells the name and address, 
then we will go.
[21:19] Grandma, great idea. 
This way we will also find out.
[21:23] Okay fine.
[21:24] Find out.
[21:27] Ok.
[21:28] Mama, should I massage oil in your head.
[21:30] Hey the massage will be done, 
first find out.
[21:34] Where is Fareed, call him.
[21:36] Should I call him?
[21:38] Call him,
[21:40] do get the oil too.
[21:45] Roshni,
[21:47] please stop crying.
[21:51] Roshni, you are taking me wrong, 
my love stop crying.
[21:54] I understood correctly,
[21:57] if she doesn’t like someone,
[21:58] she is not that sort of a girl
[22:00] and I like you so I am that sort of a girl.
[22:04] You are taking me wrong.
[22:06] I am understanding correctly.
[22:08] I lie at home and come to meet you,
[22:12] I spend time with you alone, 
I want to marry you,
[22:16] so I became someone with a bad character.
[22:18] What are you saying…
[22:19] Maheen is really respectable, right?
[22:21] Roshni, its not that,
 you are taking me wrong.
[22:23] I am not wrong,
[22:26] I am thinking right.
[22:29] Its good I found out your reality,
[22:32] what was in your heart, 
came on your tongue.
[22:36] Your love has already 
given me a lot of sorrow,
[22:41] fine,
[22:43] another one now.
[22:46] Your love has only given me tears and 
pain and now give me defamation too.
[22:52] What?
[22:53] I…
[22:54] one minute, man.
[23:01] I will defame you?
[23:02] Me?
[23:04] I love you, why would I defame you?
[23:09] I am sorry, man, I know I have hurt you,
[23:11] forgive me.
[23:13] I will also make amends for it.
[23:15] I took a week’s time from you that 
I will send my family over with a proposal,
[23:20] now I will send them sooner, you will see.
[23:37] You did it and I will see.
[23:38] Roshni.
[23:40] Roshni, listen to me…
[23:42] Leave me, Umar.
[24:42] Mama, you came suddenly…
[24:44] Its good,
[24:46] she will know clearly today.
[24:49] Hello.
[24:52] Why?
[24:54] Are you really worried that 
your mother doesn’t get worried finding out,
[24:58] making weird wishes from your uncle,
[25:01] giving Umar incorrect confidence, 
did you not care about us?
[25:04] What is wrong mama? All ok?
[25:06] What is ok, Zakia?
[25:07] You are here now,
[25:08] ask your daughter what she has been doing.
[25:11] What did you do?
[25:13] Did you fight with Umar again?
[25:14] I told you so many times 
not to fight with your husband.
[25:17] Okay no problem, 
I will make her understand,
[25:20] they are husband and wife, 
they have arguments.
[25:23] Why are you not telling me? 
what did you do?
[25:25] Did you fight with your husband?
[25:27] If she considered him her husband,
 she would fought then.
[25:30] Hey, does a wife do what she is doing?
[25:33] I am sure she doesn’t want to live with Umar.
[25:37] No sister, how is that possible?
 Why don’t you tell me, what did you do?
[25:44] Do you have shame?
[25:45] I trusted you so much 
and you have lowered my head
[25:50] and you are standing 
in front of me so stubbornly.
[25:58] Lie to me,
[26:00] cheat me again,
[26:02] say that whatever I saw was wrong,
[26:03] it was a lie,
[26:05] say that I cannot see.
[26:07] Was this your friend’s brother?
[26:12] Yes,
[26:13] he was not my friend’s brother,
[26:15] he was my friend’s husband.
[26:17] Are you happy now after spying on me?
[26:21] Shameless!
[26:23] So much happened but 
you have no shame in your eyes.
[26:27] I want to go to Zakia right now and
 tell her to tighten her son in law’s ropes,
[26:34] he is having an affair with a wife at home.
[26:38] But what can I do?
[26:40] I cannot do this,
[26:41] I cannot say all this.
[26:43] Because he is a man,
[26:46] the woman gets blamed.
[26:49] People will spit on you.
[26:51] Everyone will say that you didn’t 
even leave your friend’s home.
[26:54] I didn’t attack my friend’s home,
[26:56] she cheated me,
[26:58] she knew about me and Umar, 
then why did she come in between?
[27:02] And I will not leave my place.
[27:04] What place? What position?
[27:06] You have nothing.
[27:08] He married that girl in front of everyone.
[27:11] He is married.
[27:13] He is someone’s husband.
[27:16] You shameless girl, 
not anyone’s she is your friend’s husband.
[27:19] Forget him.
[27:20] I will not forget him!
[27:31] I will not let anyone take over my fate,
[27:35] what is mine is mine!
[27:41] What is a wedding,
[27:43] its there today,
[27:44] it won’t be there tomorrow.
[27:46] She will not stay his wife.
[27:51] Where did you get this courage from?
[27:55] I am thinking,
[27:57] why didn’t I choke you to death
 when you were born?
[28:02] You have any idea
 how you have cheated me?
[28:07] You have any idea?
[28:09] Shameless, are you not ashamed?
[28:12] Die.
[28:13] Die.
[28:20] Today you have killed me while I am alive.
[28:27] Go!
[28:48] If it was just about Umar,
[28:50] we would have beaten him up
 and made him understand,
[28:52] but we are upset with her,
[28:54] she is supporting Umar.
[28:57] She has almost convinced her father in law.
[29:00] Zakia, talk to your daughter, 
make her understand,
[29:03] I am worried that she will leave 
alone taking her husband as a groom.
[29:09] We have been made fun of,
 people have cursed us,
[29:13] but Zakia, you too will have to get 
your daughter sit at home.
[29:17] She doesn’t want to live in her home, 
she wants others to live in that home.
[29:21] Mama.
[29:22] What are you doing?
[29:23] Get out of my way.
[29:24] Leave her. Leave her.
[29:26] Leave me.
[29:26] Leave her Zakia. Leave her. 
Stop Zakia. Leave her.
[29:35] Zakia, stop it.
[29:36] You are my son in law,
 so I cannot raise my hand on you.
[29:39] Or else what her fault is,
 you have a bigger mistake.
[29:43] Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
[29:44] Tell me, what did my daughter lack?
[29:47] Umar. Umar, take her inside,
[29:49] Zakia will kill her.
[29:51] You should have thought of this earlier,
[29:53] you are calling aunt Zakia, 
and complaining about her,
[29:55] this will happen.
[29:57] Everyone hear me clearly,
[29:59] no one punish Maheen for what I did.
[30:03] Come on Maheen.
[30:19] This girl has ruined me.
[30:23] she has ruined my peace, Umar too.
[30:26] I will get water.
[30:28] Yes.
[30:29] Relax.
[30:48] Maheen.
[30:50] Maheen, I am sorry.
[30:53] Maheen, sorry, all this is because of me.
[30:55] No.
[30:56] No.
[30:57] all this is because of me,
[31:00] had I not come in your way,
[31:02] your path would have been easier.
[31:05] But I too have ruined your path because of me,
[31:09] I am so selfish,
[31:12] I did something so wrong,
[31:16] for my work, for myself, I put you in front.
[31:19] You got blamed for everything.
[31:23] To be honest, I felt that if you agree,
[31:27] the whole family would agree easily 
or else they might never agree.
[31:32] But I didn’t know all this would happen.
[31:35] Okay, please stop crying Maheen.
[31:40] I am not crying cause of you,
[31:43] I am crying cause of my mother.
[31:46] I never wanted to hurt her,
 but I gave her pain.
[31:55] Even I never wanted to hurt you,
[31:59] but I did.
[32:03] I am not hurt Umar,
[32:05] I am fine.
[32:11] Sorry Maheen.
[32:15] You have to hear so much,
[32:18] you have to go through so much.
[32:24] Now no more.
[32:27] I…
[32:32] I will fight my battle myself.
[32:40] I am sorry.
[32:56] What was the need to raise your hand on the daughter, 
what is her fault in it?
[33:00] How do I raise my hand on 
the one who is at fault, brother?
[33:05] The one whose responsibility it is 
to raise his hand on, he has given up.
[33:10] What do you mean?
[33:12] Is there just one solution for all problems?
[33:13] Raising your hand on your young children?
[33:16] But brother, at least give me enough permission
 to stop Maheen from doing what she is doing.
[33:21] If the wife gets stubborn,
[33:22] especially when the in-laws are standing with her,
[33:25] then the husband won’t 
dare go anywhere else.
[33:28] This thankless girl doesn’t see this 
that the in-laws are with her,
[33:33] she is willing to ruin her life herself.
[33:39] Okay sister in law,
[33:42] I will leave now.
[33:43] I have one request with 
you people to stand with her,
[33:47] put some sense into her head.
[33:50] This widow doesn’t have the courage to see
 my divorced daughter standing at my door now.
[33:54] God forbid Zakia.
[33:56] Brother, I don’t know 
why you are taking Umar’s side,
[33:59] what is your helplessness,
[34:01] I just know that I gave you my daughter,
[34:05] its your responsibility to make her settle down in this home,
[34:08] if you send her back,
[34:10] I will kill her and die myself too.
[34:13] Zakia…
[34:37] Bad time has come on me today,
[34:39] you left me,
[34:41] you left me alone, 
stopped talking to me.
[34:45] You got upset with me yourself 
and now you are being stubborn.
[34:50] Mama was right,
[34:53] men like you consider a girl a toy
 and play with her emotions,
[34:59] you have shown your 
true colors really soon, Umar.
[35:02] I was just a temporary entertainment for you,
[35:04] you just wanted to play,
[35:05] you wanted to enjoy, you did that,
[35:07] and now you left me, right?
[35:12] You did wrong with me, Umar.
[35:16] You did really wrong.
[35:18] And you have left me alone at this time.
[35:22] I am all alone.
[35:55] You had said your friendship 
with Maheen is the same,
[36:01] then ask Maheen as a friend who she likes,
[36:06] who is in her heart.
[36:10] Please Roshni…
[36:11] Look, listen. Listen to me,
[36:13] this way you will not be blamed alone,
[36:16] you can tell your family 
that Maheen’s will was in it,
[36:19] because Maheen likes someone else.
