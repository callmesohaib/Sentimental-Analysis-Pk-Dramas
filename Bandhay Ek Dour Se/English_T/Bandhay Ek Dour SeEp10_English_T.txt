[00:19] I was worried for my daughter.
[00:22] Our Maheen is good,
[00:25] so God gave her a good fate.
[00:29] he really likes Mahi.
[00:31] Razia send me to sending her
Umar couldn’t see her sad,
[00:36] he said he would bring her.
[00:39] tell Roshni to come meet her friend.
[00:41] Yes, she will surely come.
[00:44] He doesn’t consider me his mother in law,
[00:46] he thinks of me as his mother.
[00:48] This proves how much he loves Mahi.
[00:51] God protect them from the evil eye
[00:53] Ameen.
[00:54] have tea, it’s getting cold
[01:32] You two are imbeciles,
[01:35] Maheen my friend,
[01:39] you saw the coast is clear,
[01:42] you got on to him.
[01:45] And poor Umar,
[01:47] I thought he would commit suicide.
[01:52] But he was just waiting that
[01:55] I step back and he takes the step.
[02:25] Maheen, you are a great girl,
[02:31] I know as much as I know myself.
[02:34] I know you didn’t come between me
and Roshni on purpose.
[02:40] You have no fault,
[02:42] you were as helpless as me.
In fact more.
[02:48] I have no complaints from you,
[02:52] but what do I do of
Roshni’s complaints,
[02:59] her sadness, her tears,
[03:05] they will increase the burden on me.
[03:09] The thing is aunt
Shahista selected me for Nabeel,
[03:14] that is why they are calling me
[03:16] so that I can see how they live.
[03:21] Umar.
[03:26] Umar.
[03:29] Umar, I think you
should meet Roshni.
[03:36] I should?
[03:39] yes.
[03:43] Maybe the burden on your heart
will reduce and not increase.
[03:54] I should have told you earlier,
[03:57] but it’s best
Roshni tells you herself.
[04:04] You go meet her.
[04:29] You want ice cream?
[04:32] Why are you saying no to ice cream?
[04:34] Are you feeling ok?
[04:38] Its not necessary that what we like for us is good
for us because the weather is changing,
[04:47] if I have something cold,
I will get a sore throat immediately.
[04:52] Let’s have coffee.
[04:57] You are avoiding meeting her,
[05:04] right?
[05:47] Hello.
[05:48] Yes, Roshni, is all ok?
You left suddenly.
[05:52] You still want to know the reason?
[05:55] you left suddenly,
it’s my duty to ask you the reason.
[05:59] Did you mind anything?
[06:01] You mother and son
don’t act so innocent,
[06:04] what did you think before making the offer?
Are we that low?
[06:08] You could have said no.
[06:09] No one forced you.
[06:11] Mama said nothing wrong.
[06:14] This too is a house job,
no work makes you small.
[06:19] don’t give me a lecture on work,
[06:23] go give this lecture to your mother,
[06:25] who goes around with your mother.
[06:27] Lecture your queen, tell her to handle the home,
the servants because it’s not bad to work.
[06:38] What is your problem?
[06:40] problem?
[06:41] I will tell you what the problem is.
[06:43] Don’t dare calling me and you and your mother if you call here
[06:45] and say anything about that day.
[06:50] You don’t know my mother, she will ruin you.
Cut the phone now.
[06:57] Idiot.
[07:03] He has ruined me,
ruined everything.
[07:08] I have no where to go,
[07:11] die Nabeel.
[07:14] Because of you I showed off in front of Maheen
[07:17] and Maheen
[07:19] would have told all
this to Umar with addition.
[07:30] umar.
[07:31] yeah?
[07:34] Mama is saying so much,
you should stay.
[07:38] No,
[07:40] I will go.
[07:44] I can call uncle and talk.
[07:51] Meet Roshni too.
[07:56] You want to add salt to my wounds?
[07:58] No,
[08:00] I am trying to reduce your pain.
[08:06] Honestly Maheen,
[08:11] I cannot see tears in her eyes.
[08:17] Maybe she wont cry.
[08:25] I cannot bear being labeled unfaithful.
[08:31] What if you are not unfaithful.
[08:49] okay, I will come.
[08:59] Have more.
[09:00] No, I am fine.
[09:02] did you see,
[09:03] this is what annoys me about Zakia.
[09:05] She already controlled Umar,
[09:07] now he is her son in law,
she has him more in her control.
[09:11] what is wrong?
[09:12] If he waits for a night it wont matter.
[09:15] It’s not just his in laws
but his uncle’s home too.
[09:18] Now its just his in-laws
[09:21] and Umar should treat them like in laws.
[09:27] okay,
[09:30] how do son's in law treat their in laws?
[09:34] have you forgotten your time?
[09:36] You used to come for a few moments,
and sit there doing nothing.
[09:48] Hello.
[09:49] Hello.
[09:51] Hello.
[09:54] Hey,
[09:56] what happened to mama?
[09:58] Did Najia come?
[10:01] Your mother doesn’t need
Najia to get upset,
[10:05] she has another daughter in law.
[10:07] I had told Umar not to do
anything that annoys Razia but no,
[10:15] he is married now and
he stayed there at night.
[10:18] She is upset about that.
[10:20] Wow,
[10:22] he stayed there at night,
[10:24] till yesterday he had issues.
[10:27] You tell me.
[10:29] Yes papa, all fine.
[10:31] I can see that.
[10:51] please come Roshni,
[10:54] for the last time.
[10:58] Insult me as much as you like,
[11:01] I want to apologize you,
[11:05] maybe my feeling of crime will go down.
[11:32] Mahi,
[11:35] why are you sitting here?
Go sleep.
[11:44] I am used to my home.
[11:48] Really?
[11:49] You have been living here for ages,
[11:51] but it’s good you made it your home.
[11:57] Okay go, sleep nos.
[12:01] I am lying down here,
[12:05] I will sleep later.
[12:31] why are you calling now?
[12:33] To announce his victory or to insult me that
he didn’t take a day to marry Maheen when he left me.
[12:40] I will never go get insulted.
[12:59] in fact, I will go.
[13:01] What will he do? Insult me?
[13:04] I will insult him too.
What do they think of themselves?
[13:37] why did you call me here?
[13:55] what are you looking at?
[13:57] Speak up.
[14:01] Blame me. Insult me.
[14:08] But Umar you are not innocent either.
[14:15] The haste you showed,
[14:18] it shows you were waiting for the right moment.
[14:22] I don’t know since
when you wanted to get rid of me.
[14:30] You got a chance and bounced onto it.
[14:36] Speak up.
Why don’t you say something?
[15:06] Roshni, you speak,
[15:07] I will hear you.
[15:11] I came to hear you today.
[15:22] You speak,
[15:25] I am unable to say anything.
[15:32] Say what you want,
[15:38] I am your criminal.
[15:45] Criminal?
[15:47] Yes Roshni,
[15:49] I committed a big crime.
[15:52] I made so many promises
[15:56] and stepped back.
[16:03] Your faithfulness,
your wait, your love,
[16:08] I didn’t care for anything.
[16:19] I don’t want to repeat
anything cause anything
[16:25] I say will not reduce
your sorrow but increase it,
[16:39] but if possible forgive me.
[17:03] You may hate me all your life,
[17:11] but see my hands and
if makes you feel better,
[17:18] I will stand like this
in front of you all my life.
[17:24] Please forgive me.
[18:27] Umar.
[18:31] Did Roshni say something?
[18:36] Please Maheen don’t console me.
[18:39] I don’t want consolation.
[18:43] Just stay quiet like Roshni.
[19:22] I am your sinner,
[19:24] I made so many promises
I stepped back.
[19:28] I didn’t care for your love,
faithfulness.
[19:35] Umar still thinks about me after separating,
this is good for me.
[19:44] This means Umar is still mine.
[19:49] Maheen is in his life,
but I still rule his heart.
[20:07] Hey,
[20:09] you haven’t started eating.
[20:13] Hey Imar, why the long face?
[20:16] He had a headache last night,
that’s why.
[20:21] what was the need to go to the roof at night,
you must have caught a cold.
[20:24] Have this tea.
[20:29] Thank you, I will have it.
[20:32] Tell me,
what do you want for lunch?
[20:36] Err…
[20:37] Mama, we were leaving.
[20:40] okay.
[20:42] You can stay if you want.
[20:44] No, she will go with you,
[20:46] you will have visitors that will come,
it doesn’t look nice.
[20:48] Mama forgot her veil,
let me get that.
[20:53] I don’t want to stay myself.
[20:55] Its not right to leave you,
what will you think.
[21:01] What do you think,
I am contemplating suicide?
[21:06] God forbid.
[21:09] Have something..
[21:10] Yeah
[21:16] What happened to Umar?
He came and left.
[21:19] Must have had something to do.
[21:20] Hey, what can be more
important in his life than you?
[21:25] I have heard that
[21:28] thing you get easily you
don’t respect them,
[21:32] but he got you with difficulty,
he should stay close.
[21:36] Okay, I am sure he went to the shrine.
[21:42] I will talk to him when he comes,
I will ask him what he did.
[21:45] Hey did you not go to school?
[21:49] I took a day off for Maheen.
[21:54] even when there is a storm,
you don’t take the day off,
[21:58] how did you do it now?
Why does Mahi need to?
[22:03] I thought I would give her company,
make her comfortable.
[22:13] Mahi is at her uncle’s home not with
strangers that you make her comfortable.
[22:18] Do we scare her?
[22:22] mama, you take
everything I say wrong.
[22:26] You don’t want me to be friends
with anyone at home,
[22:29] then you complain to Mansoor that
I don’t get close to anyone at home.
[22:34] wow, you never thought of
getting close to us.
[22:40] Mahi,
[22:42] listen to me,
[22:44] stay away from her,
she is cunning.
[22:47] Stay away.
[22:51] She must be cursing me, right?
[22:53] No aunt.
[22:55] Don’t cover up,
I know her well,
[22:59] if you listen to her you wont be
able to settle down in this home,
[23:06] just like her, she has not made
a place in this home or our hearts.
[23:12] Stay away.
[23:55] What is this?
[23:57] I had told you stay home for a day 
after your reception and then join work.
[24:01] I thought what would I do at home.
[24:14] he was dying of sadness.
[24:18] ok whatever, go home early, 
in fact go to the market,
[24:21] get something for the 
reception and on this Friday,
[24:25] take Maheen to Swat 
or Nathiagali, ok?
[24:51] see.
[24:53] Hello.
[24:55] Why were you not 
answering my phone?
[24:59] Oh,
[25:01] your new wife would 
have been with you,
[25:05] that is why you 
didn’t answer.
[25:08] Papa was here.
[25:09] I want to meet you Umar.
[25:12] I came to meet you last night,
[25:14] so that you can say what you want,
[25:16] take out your anger. 
But you..
[25:20] look,
[25:21] mama has told me the situation in 
which this wedding happened,
[25:24] you were under so much pressure.
[25:26] I usually get angry at you,
[25:29] but I sympathize with you.
[25:33] I am upset with you, 
but I cant hate you.
[25:39] Get angry,
[25:42] it will be easy for you
[25:45] Okay,
[25:47] then meet me,
[25:49] I will see under how 
much pressure you were ,
[25:52] how sad you were,
[25:53] how disappointed you were 
breaking your promises for me,
[25:58] then maybe I will hate you.
[26:05] Hello.
[26:08] Umar, you will meet me, right?
[26:12] Tell me, where should I come?
[26:40] Move.
[26:41] Hey, what happened Najia?
[26:44] Today was the limit,
[26:46] she insulted me so much in front 
of the jew bride, left me with no respect.
[26:53] When you know you and mama 
don’t get along why do you go downstairs?
[26:59] This is the reason why papa 
sent me to this portion to avoid this.
[27:06] Having a separate portion means 
you are not his son? I am not their daughter in law?
[27:10] You can go, but I cant, why?
[27:15] I am still the elder daughter in law,
[27:18] she has been here for 2 days,
[27:20] she is the favorite now.
[27:22] She is the daughter in law, so am I, 
what is the difference?
[27:42] Najia, you know well this 
wedding was against her will.
[27:48] I had informed you before 
wedding you will have to compromise.
[27:56] I am compromising.
[27:59] I agree she doesn’t 
like her son's choice,
[28:05] she wanted you to marry with her will, 
then why this double standard now.
[28:10] I told you not to 
mention this again?
[28:14] why? Why shouldn’t I?
[28:18] What if she has poison for 
Maheen in her heart,
[28:21] just like me.
[28:22] You worry so much for her, 
never for me.
[28:29] Even if I try to make things 
better between you and mama,
[28:32] but you will ruin it Najia, 
with your tongue.
[28:58] Roshni,
[29:02] please for God's sake, 
stop crying.
[29:07] I can’t see your tears,
[29:09] you say anything, curse me,
[29:13] but not these tears, please.
[29:17] I don’t have the 
courage to curse you,
[29:22] had you lied to me,
[29:26] got rid of me,
[29:29] it would have been easier 
to hate you, curse you.
[29:35] I was helpless Roshni,
[29:38] I swear to God.
[29:42] Yes,
[29:45] but I am your criminal.
[29:48] You know Umar,
[29:51] I feel me not being their was God's will
[29:57] because I would have been tortured 
seeing you be someone else.
[30:05] But you must have thought
[30:08] the girl who didn’t stay for you for a moment, 
you wont wait for her either.
[30:13] No why would I think like that for you.
[30:18] I knew why you took this step.
[30:21] You wanted me to send 
my family over to your home.
[30:26] You were right in your place.
[30:29] I even know that your mother sent you.
[30:33] I got there and I found out why she sent me.
[30:38] My proposal was there,
[30:44] but I was tired to your promises,
[30:47] I have faith you would 
fulfill you promises.
[30:53] But you gave up Umar,
[30:56] but I didn’t I stood 
strong and said no.
[31:07] You said no?
[31:08] Yes, I said no.
[31:14] Mama really got upset,
[31:16] but I didn’t care.
[31:20] I being a weak girl, 
lived up to my promises. Umar you…
[31:26] Roshni, forgive me please.
[31:31] There is no point of 
apologizing or regretting it.
[31:34] I told her I would marry someone I like,
[31:38] not a rich man she chooses.
[31:42] I don’t care about money and home.
[31:45] I loved you, not your wealth Umar.
[31:50] Now mama is asking me when the 
boy will come with their proposal
[31:53] and I have no answer. What do I tell her?
[31:58] The boy I left everything for,
[32:01] he, he was…
[32:49] see this mama, 
all this is Mahi's jewelry.
[32:53] Get it polished, 
there is no shine.
[32:58] Mama, it is still gold, 
there was no time.
[33:04] People will see it and know it’s 
at least 15-20 tolas and Zakia,
[33:09] she gave her nothing
[33:13] Those people were imbeciles,
[33:16] they had told Zakia that there should be at least 6-7 sets.
[33:19] She with difficulty
[33:21] and adding her own gold 
was able to make 12 tolas.
[33:26] Now 6 sets in 12 tolas 
means nothing.
[33:30] thanksGod we got rid of those people or 
they would have cursed for these sets.
[33:37] It’s just me who said nothing.
[33:40] Don’t say anything.
[33:42] Hello aunt.
[33:44] Hello. Hello my queen. 
Come. Come sit.
[33:49] This Razia didn’t make you stuff 
but she got great dresses for you
[33:57] see Maheen, these are all for you,
[33:59] mama says they don’t shine,
[34:03] we will give it to the jeweller after 
the reception and get it polished
[34:11] Now Najia will get upset,
[34:13] you gave her 2 dresses and a set of gold.
[34:16] let her get upset, 
I am upset at her.
[34:23] Okay, will you go show 
her the dress or not?
[34:27] Yes mama, I will get it, 
hold this.
[34:34] I will get it.
[34:38] what is it Maheen?
[34:41] You look upset, you don’t talk.
[34:47] No grandma, nothing like that.
[34:51] I apologize on Razia's behalf,
[34:55] she said yes to me and Fareed and 
she will take her anger out on you.
[35:00] Same she did with Najia.
[35:03] She is fine with you, 
but you are away from her.
[35:11] No, I didn’t mean that grandma,
[35:18] I will try.
[35:20] Look, you are at no strangers,
[35:23] you have your grandma 
and uncle here. ,
[35:29] Look child the sooner you 
make a heart in Razia's heart,
[35:34] the better.
[35:37] She runs the home,
[35:40] Faris and Umar are in her control.
[35:44] If she doesn’t like you, 
then she will treat you like Najia.
[35:50] She is strong she stands up,
[35:53] what will you do?
[35:57] Yes grandma.
[36:05] Where do you go alone?
[36:07] I had some work
[36:08] what work? That you had to go alone,
[36:11] you have never done that. I don’t like 
you roaming out in the market like this,
[36:14] if you had asked me, 
I would have come along.
[36:15] Have you ever gone with me to the market?
[36:18] you used to go with Maheen 
or the girls in the locality,
[36:21] what was the need to go alone?
[36:23] mama, should I have Maheen stick with me?
[36:26] When she went to her in laws, 
did she take me along that I take her?
[36:30] Hey Zakia came.
[36:34] So?
[36:36] It’s the reception, we have to go. 
You be ready.
[36:41] Reception.
[36:42] Yes, Maheen's. We have to go.
[36:44] mama they not invited in wedding 
why we go Reception
[36:48] have you gone mad, Roshni?
[36:50] We were invited,
[36:52] you left everything and went to Shahista.
[36:55] but mama that wedding never happened.
[36:58] Did she call us to Umar's wedding?
[37:00] She didn’t even let us know, 
let alone invite us.
[37:03] Oh God, Roshni,
[37:04] I feel since you have come from 
Shahista's you have gone mad.
[37:10] I just told you everything how hasty the wedding was.
[37:13] Now will you make this the reason to not 
attend the wedding of your childhood friend.
[37:20] She had nothing in her control,
[37:25] not doing the wedding, 
nor saying no.
[37:28] why didn’t she have control?
[37:29] She could have said mo,
[37:31] but madam got ready 
that too to get married.
[37:36] Roshni, I cannot reason with you.
[37:45] Cunning woman.
