[00:22] I don’t know aunt, 
you come with us right now.
[00:25] Hey, why do you bother her?
[00:28] I mean, 
its not her age to travel in rickshaws.
[00:31] It takes an hour to one and a half
hours to get to our home in a rickshaw.
[00:35] No, mama is fine now. After all,
[00:40] she wants to see her
granddaughter happy. Mama go.
[00:45] Yes, sure.
[00:46] Son, talk to the generator guy to give
us the generator on rent for a few days.
[00:51] We have 10-12 hours of
load shedding, mama will fall ill.
[00:57] Yes, I will go and say for a month,
when he gets married.
[01:03] Yeah, haha.
[01:04] Zakia,
[01:06] did you look for a girl for Monis?
[01:08] Mama, you look for a girl for Monis.
[01:10] Why Monis? Why not you?
[01:15] Zakia aunt,
[01:16] she will find someone for me.
[01:18] Right aunt Zakia,
we will share responsibilities.
[01:21] Yes, why not,
but I have found a girl for Monis.
[01:27] Huh?
[01:28] What?
[01:30] Yes, must be from your in-laws,
with huge teeth.
[01:35] I have seen her,
[01:36] she grew up in front of me,
[01:38] she played with Maheen, 
our homes are connected,
[01:41] she lives in our neighborhood
and my Monis likes her too.
[01:48] I will go make a call and come back,
there are no signals here.
[01:55] No need, I know all your signals, these excuses to
go to the roof, I will fix your signals, sit and eat.
[02:06] Okay,
[02:07] so you fixed Monis’ wedding along with 
Mahi and grandma doesn’t know.
[02:14] Hey mama,
[02:15] nowadays weddings are fixed like this, 
secretly.
[02:19] What is the point of telling the relatives?
[02:22] They put the evil eye and 
then they create issues.
[02:25] You did good Zakia.
[02:27] I am the grandma,
[02:29] I am not from the people 
who will put an evil eye.
[02:32] Let me know what problems 
I have created earlier?
[02:36] You do good by helping your 
mother in law out in serving the guests.
[02:40] I have heard you got a separate stove.
[02:42] Yes, she did it, but it took 1.5 years,
[02:45] unlike you, you went away in 4 months.
[02:52] Grandma, tea.
[02:54] Monis, have tea.
[03:03] I will not let you break the 
relation half way through.
[03:08] Your wedding is fixed 
and you didn’t even tell me,
[03:13] that too with my cousin, Monis.
[03:16] Pick up your phone, damn it.
[03:24] Why did you leave me 
alone and come here?
[03:29] I got mama,
[03:31] but the situation is not right.
[03:34] You handle the situation.
[03:35] You are ruining the situation 
and you want me to handle it.
[03:40] Look at me,
[03:43] how long has this been going on for?
[03:45] What?
[03:46] Proposal, wedding and all this?
[03:49] Oh that?
[03:50] Mama said that Mani will get married, 
the house will be empty,
[03:56] I told her to get it.
[04:00] You are really straight,
[04:02] did your mother not find 
anyone else but your neighbor?
[04:06] So?
[04:07] No, I mean…
[04:10] you are the only son,
[04:12] aunt should have been 
careful when finding your wife,
[04:15] she found someone
and fixed the wedding.
[04:16] What is wrong in that? 
Both families know each other.
[04:23] So,
[04:25] they must know what 
you are up to they will say no.
[04:28] Nothing like that, 
they have said yes and just like that.
[04:37] Hey,
[04:40] this?
[04:43] You still look at it?
[04:49] You tore the magazine?
[04:51] You tore the magazine?
[04:52] You tore the magazine?
[04:54] You tore the magazine? 
Why did you tear my magazine?
[04:57] Leave me. Have you gone mad?
[04:59] You tore the magazine yourself.
[05:03] You will hit me for a magazine?
[05:14] Here, go from here.
[05:15] What happened?
[05:16] Monis go from here,
[05:17] Hey, what happened?
[05:17] get lost.
[05:18] Tell me.
[05:32] This one?
[05:33] This one. I wanted this one!
[05:38] Roshni, I have not worn it once, 
it’s a completely new dress.
[05:43] You have a small heart, 
I will not take your precious dress. Weird.
[05:47] No Roshni, 
I didn’t mean that. Roshni.
[05:50] Roshni, wait man, wait.
[05:52] I was just saying,
[05:54] you keep it, 
it will look nice on you.
[05:57] Thank you.
[05:58] Okay, tell me something,
[06:01] tell me, who is your 
friend where you are going?
[06:06] You are investigating me a lot.
[06:09] Man, 
Rizwana aunt, she is our neighbor,
[06:12] she has asked for my hand for her brother,
[06:14] and I don’t like her brother a lot, 
he is dark skin,
[06:18] I don’t like it. If the boy is good looking 
like Shahid Kapoor, it makes sense.
[06:25] Roshni, what is wrong with you?
[06:27] You have such a nice guy, Umar for you.
[06:29] Why do you talk about strangers like this?
[06:33] Umar is just the name, God gave him a good face, 
but when it comes to his intelligence, he is zero.
[06:39] He is smart, listen to me.
[06:43] He only cares for his family a lot,
[06:46] I am sure he will convince the family, 
what are you doing?
[06:50] I am here, when all this 
will be fulfilled, we will see.
[06:54] I am taking your dress, 
I will return it. Ok?
[06:58] Roshni…
[06:58] Bye.
[07:01] I want this back.
[07:03] Yes, thank you bye.
[07:04] Don’t ruin it.
[07:05] I love you.
[07:07] I want my earrings back.
[07:10] Thief.
[07:43] Oh…
[07:45] Oh…phone. 
I have to clean my hands.
[07:53] One minute, don’t cut the call.
[07:55] One minute.
[07:58] Yes, go ahead.
[08:02] Hello. Yes, go ahead 
what happened. Hello.
[08:05] Leave this hello, 
tell me what you did to me?
[08:09] Monis’ wedding is fixed with the 
neighbors and you didn’t even tell me.
[08:13] Yes, sorry,
[08:14] I had to tell you, in fact, 
I had to tell you first, one second..
[08:21] i was making chicken.
[08:22] I had to tell you first, but you 
know mama does what she wants.
[08:27] Since when did the two of 
you become so obedient.
[08:30] Did you not think about me?
[08:32] You are so selfish. Both of you.
[08:35] You should have told me.
[08:36] Now don’t talk to me again, 
don’t get in touch.
[08:43] I will not let this happen Roshni,
[08:46] you talk so much,
[08:49] but you couldn’t say no to your family,
[08:53] not at all.
[08:56] I will not let you get married to Monis.
[09:00] Oh
[09:05] Oh God.
[09:13] Here.
[09:16] Keep it.
[09:25] Please, I have a headache, 
don’t eat my brain.
[09:32] Today my doubt changed to reality.
[09:36] Which doubt?
[09:37] That Umar and Mani.
[09:40] Oh God, you are still stuck there.
[09:44] That girl is getting married,
[09:46] why do you want to defame her.
[09:49] Umar is so happy 
like her real brother.
[09:52] That is the thing.
[09:54] I felt I was mistaken,
[09:56] but today I am sure I was right.
[09:59] You know today aunt Zakia came 
with the sweets for Mahi’s wedding,
[10:03] you know he had a hope that 
this proposal would end,
[10:08] that is gone too. If you were here,
[10:12] you would have seen Umar’s long face,
you would have worried.
[10:13] He has locked himself in the room 
and seeing his face, I realized…
[10:18] Cant you see my face and 
realize that I really need to tea.
[10:22] You only read the faces of people.
[10:24] I will get it, listen to me first. 
Umar loves Mahi.
[10:29] I am sure mama arranged 
something for aunt Zakia over tea,
[10:33] if something is left, get that too.
[10:37] A lot is saved,
[10:39] because aunt Zakia 
was full of mama’s taunts
[10:43] and then what was left, 
mama lovingly gave to grandma.
[10:51] Mama, fed grandma. 
How did that happen?
[10:54] Why wouldn’t that happen?
[10:55] Grandma insulted the younger 
daughter in law so much,
[11:00] you can’t imagine. 
So she cared for her.
[11:03] Man, this female politics, 
I don’t get it.
[11:07] What politics?
[11:08] I gave you such a big news 
and you call it politics.
[11:12] Umar has called so many 
times and driven me mad.
[11:16] See, if you find a someone so 
mad after you like this, change my name.
[11:22] Roshni doesn’t need this,
[11:24] and she has people like Umar 
around her all the time.
[11:28] I am sure something happened at home,
[11:30] so he is calling again and again.
[11:32] He only has excuses, 
that we will do this today,
[11:35] I will do that, it does nothing.
[11:37] Poor thing, I feel bad for him,
[11:40] he caught between love 
and issues at home. He has gone mad too.
[11:44] Maheen, no man is poor, 
they all need one thing.
[11:50] Ok, brother Monis is here, 
I will talk to you later.
[11:54] Fine.
[11:58] Stop it. Come sit there.
[12:17] If mama had told them earlier, 
this wouldn’t have happened.
[12:20] You know sister in law’s anger was justified.
[12:23] I am sure Umar told you to say this, 
that is why I don’t go to your uncle.
[12:28] Mama, brother is right,
[12:31] you know, in our good and bad times,
[12:34] grandma and uncle have come to our help. 
Whether aunt likes it or not.
[12:38] Well done child, well done.
[12:40] Your mother worked hard to bring you up 
and you are taking your grandma’s side.
[12:45] Oh God, go from here, leave me alone.
[12:58] Mama, I have made bread, 
don’t ask me for anything else,
[13:02] my head hurts, I am going to sleep.
[13:10] What is his problem? I have told him 
so many times not to call me,
[13:13] but still he is calling again and again.
[13:24] Oh…
[13:26] Don’t think Roshni that you will 
cheat me and hide your face.
[13:30] You will have to give me an answer. 
Why did you do this with me?
[13:34] Has he gone mad?
[13:37] I was with mama, 
I couldn’t answer his phone.
[13:40] I don’t want to talk to you either.
[13:43] I won’t respond on call or 
reply to his message. Stupid, idiot.
[14:07] She cut my call?
[14:09] This means Monis was right,
[14:11] she agreed to the wedding.
[14:13] If she had to do all this, 
then why did she fool me?
[14:21] What did you think? what do 
we gift on the wedding I mean?
[14:27] What will I think?
[14:29] you decided everything 
yourself I am sure. I don’t care.
[14:34] You sell the home and gift it as a gift, 
or sell the land.
[14:39] If it is still less, then take a loan.
[14:44] Why would I do that? 
Take a loan. I will give what I can.
[14:49] Then give a tea set,
[14:52] cause the financial condition 
of yours that you tell us,
[14:54] giving her a tea set is out of our reach.
[14:59] Its useless to talk to you,
[15:02] mama, you tell me.
[15:05] Maheen,
[15:07] if she was not the last sign of my son,
[15:09] I wouldn’t even give Zakia’s child my fever.
[15:14] What can we do, 
we will have to give her something.
[15:17] Give everything at the wedding.
[15:20] On the engagement give her 1000 or 2000.
[15:23] I will find a dress at home and give it.
[15:26] Do what you want,
[15:28] there are a couple of months to the wedding,
[15:31] we will figure something out.
[15:33] I think lets go tomorrow, 
the engagement is in two days.
[15:38] Hey, what is the need to go?
[15:41] You really care for her,
[15:42] you know Zakia has issues caring for guests.
[15:47] She will have a long face if she 
sees us. We will go on the day, that is it.
[15:51] Let her make a face, we don’t care.
[15:54] I will go 2-3 days in advance 
and live there with Umar.
[15:58] Right Umar? You will come with me, right?
[16:05] Where?
[16:06] Hey, where are you focused on?
[16:10] To Mahi’s home, 
where else? Will you go?
[16:14] I don’t want to go grandma.
[16:16] Hey, why not?
[16:18] Mama, if the kid is not in the mood, 
leave it, why do you force her?
[16:23] Fine, drop grandma.
[16:26] No papa, I cannot go drop her,
[16:28] call Monis, he will come 
pick her up. I have work.
[16:32] Why Mr. Umar?
[16:33] What work do you have?
[16:35] He must have work.
[16:37] Why do you want to go to the 
engagement 2 days in advance?
[16:41] He will go with us, that is it.
[16:42] No, I won’t go with you,
[16:44] I won’t go, not now, 
not then. I don’t want to go,
[16:47] nor should anyone ask me to go.
[16:49] Hey Umar, 
what happened to you? Are you mad?
[16:53] You won’t go to Mahi’s engagement? 
Mahi’s engagement?
[16:57] You two have played together 
since childhood, you have so much love.
[17:01] Wont this break her heart?
[17:03] Huh?
[17:06] Someone must have said something, 
that is why he is not going.
[17:09] Yes, I create issues.
[17:13] Umar.
[17:16] Did you add sugar?
[17:18] You get sugar in this age.
[17:20] Put your finger in it, 
it will be come poison.
[17:23] Ask mama. I will do it.
[17:46] Why are you calling me now?
[17:47] Where are you everyone 
is waiting for you for so long.
[17:50] You know its music night, please, 
if you don’t come it won’t be fun. Come fast.
[17:55] Okay, do you want me to sit in front of 
you and you will make fun of my helplessness.
[18:00] You will set the tone.
[18:02] Yes, I am here to set the 
tone on your weddings.
[18:07] Obviously, you are my cousin,
[18:09] my best friend, 
what is your problem?
[18:13] Mahi, don’t act smart with me.
[18:17] What? What happened?
[18:19] What you are doing,
[18:20] after all your mission is complete,
[18:22] why do you need me?
[18:24] Your work is done, 
your in-laws will be happy that
[18:26] you befriends your family, 
your engagement will be good, that is it.
[18:29] Why are you saying this?
[18:31] What nonsense is this? 
Do you even think before speaking?
[18:34] This is nonsense? 
What about what you people did to me?
[18:38] I thought you are naïve,
[18:40] but you are cunning.
[18:42] Roshni was right, she told me you 
are cunning, but I didn’t listen to her.
[18:46] You are cunning.
[18:48] Fine, so Roshni instigated you.
[18:51] That is great, you listen to her.
[18:54] You know me since childhood,
[18:56] how long have you met her for. 
But she is truthful and I am a liar.
[18:59] You know what, 
I don’t have time for all this.
[19:02] You die, you go to hell. 
No one is waiting for you, get lost.
[19:08] God knows what has happened to this 
mad man, I don’t know what his problem is.
[19:14] She is responsible and she is blaming me.
[19:21] Thank God mama went for 2 days,
[19:23] she interferes in everything.
[19:26] I couldn’t look for the suit with her around.
[19:29] Hay
[19:44] Song.....
[20:16] Roshni, come sit here. Come on get up.
[20:19] Dance girls, dance.
[20:26] What song are you singing?
[20:29] Song....
[20:43] Zakia,
[20:46] you are dancing and 
singing better than the girls.
[20:48] You are the mother of the girl, 
do you act like this? Have some shame.
[21:34] Come on, the movie is on.
[21:36] What is wrong?
[21:37] You want to watch a movie
[21:39] and I am sad to see Umar like this. 
Poor thing.
[21:45] Lock the door,
[21:47] you are keeping an 
eye on Umar for no reason.
[21:50] I am coming.
[22:03] You know you are a bad brother,
[22:08] why don’t you do anything for him.
[22:10] What should I do?
[22:11] Move.
[22:13] Man…
[22:14] What do you do?
[22:18] Talk to mama and papa.
[22:19] Oh…
[22:23] I think first I should tell Umar what is going on in 
his heart. That you have found out for no reason,
[22:30] maybe he doesn’t even 
know what you are up to.
[22:34] I swear I am telling the truth,
[22:37] a person acts like this when 
their lover gets married somewhere else
[22:42] or she will be someone else’s bride.
[22:46] That is when the person 
acts like this, counts stars.
[22:53] Okay, leave this, watch the movie.
[22:55] Hmmm…
[22:56] How will I watch?
[22:58] Leave it.
[23:01] Play it from the start.
[23:11] Roshni.
[23:12] Roshni.
[23:14] Yes?
[23:16] Why did you leave the music night?
[23:20] I was getting bored.
[23:23] You should have told me and come or else 
I wouldn’t have had to hear Zakia’s insult.
[23:28] Also, tell me what was the need to put 
the plates in front of her mother in law?
[23:33] You know Zakia was getting upset saying that, 
Roshni is acting like we don’t feed our mother in law.
[23:38] Ma, she is an old woman,
[23:40] what happened if I got her food, 
spoke to her. Aunt Zakia is uhhh…
[23:48] Listen,
[23:49] we know Zakia,
[23:51] she is our neighbor,
[23:53] what is the need to hug 
her mother in law?
[23:57] Anyway, 
make me a cup of tea.
[24:01] Mama, I cannot make 
tea in the middle of the night.
[24:03] Wow,
[24:05] you have a problem 
feeding your mother,
[24:08] but you can hug someone else’s 
mother in law calling them an elder.
[24:14] I am going.
[24:27] Mama,
[24:28] I got rice.
[24:30] Is it left over?
[24:34] Where did these come from?
[24:36] No where.
[24:37] I have to give this dress in 
Maheen’s engagement.
[24:41] This?
[24:42] This dress is way better from 
what your mother gave us on the wedding.
[24:49] Mansoor wants spices with food, 
can I take it.
[24:53] How long will you feed him spices,
[24:56] I am waiting for you to have it.
[25:02] Take this cup too.
[25:25] Yes papa.
[25:26] Mansoor, be there on time with 
Nadia, in fact, get there before time.
[25:31] I am going with your mother, 
at least you get there a night back.
[25:36] mama agrees?
[25:38] No i mean..
[25:39] She agrees, 
you tell me about yourself,
[25:43] will you be able to convince your mother?
[25:45] To be happy in the 
happiness of her in-laws.
[25:48] Can someone start the motor? 
There is no water.
[25:51] Hero,
[25:52] what is your plan.
[25:54] About what?
[25:56] Will you go with us or will you go with 
your brother and sister in law tomorrow?
[26:00] Papa I don’t want to go anywhere,
[26:02] not today, nor tomorrow.
[26:04] Come here.
[26:05] Come here.
[26:08] What is it?
[26:10] I am talking about 
Maheen’s engagement,
[26:13] not earning money that 
you made an excuse.
[26:18] I have an exam papa, 
I have to prepare for it, I cannot go.
[26:23] What? Paper?
[26:26] Wow, since childhood if we ask for work,
[26:31] you said you have an exam, 
you are doing your homework,
[26:34] studying hard and for years having 
this excuse, you have not done anything.
[26:41] Three months back your exams ended.
[26:45] Come with Mansoor and 
Nadia tomorrow, no stupid excuses.
[26:48] Prepare him.
[26:49] Yes papa.
[26:52] I feel Nqadia is right.
[26:55] What is this time talk about this?
[26:58] What you are going through, 
I can feel it.
[27:01] no one can feel it,
[27:03] not you or the person cause of whom this is happening.
[27:06] Everyone cares about themselves.
[27:08] Start the motor.
[27:14] My home is lucky, 
great people are over.
[27:18] Stop this, congrats to you, 
may our daughter have a great future.
[27:25] Amen.
[27:27] Where is mama?
[27:29] She is sleeping.
[27:31] God knows what medication you give her, 
she sleeps all the time.
[27:35] We didn’t give her medication.
[27:41] Where is Umar?
[27:43] He didn’t come.
[27:45] He has some work, 
he will come tomorrow.
[27:48] Okay, now his work is more 
important than coming to his aunt’s.
[27:51] Let him come, I will talk to him.
[27:53] when he does, scold him.
[27:57] How are the people?
[27:59] They are good people,
[28:00] simple people, 
have good etiquettes.
[28:06] They love my child.
[28:18] Hello
[28:19] Maheen,
[28:20] how are you?
[28:21] Listen, I heard Umar’s parents are over, 
make me meet them.
[28:26] Come meet them yourself.
[28:27] Hey, how can I meet them like this?
[28:30] You introduce me nicely.
[28:34] Why didn’t Umar come, 
will he come tomorrow?
[28:39] I don’t know.
[28:41] You must know more.
[28:43] How will I know, he is 
fighting with me on the call,
[28:47] he is sending weird messages. 
Listen,
[28:50] you will go the parlor tomorrow, 
I will come along.
[28:53] No thank you, I will go myself.
[28:56] Hey,
[28:58] how are you talking to me?
[29:01] No, I don’t need you, bye.
[29:03] Maheen,
[29:04] you had a long face on the music night, 
you are still misbehaving with me. Why?
[29:10] What happened to me?
[29:11] Did I ask you why 
Umar is so upset with me?
[29:14] What did you say to him,
[29:16] he didn’t come to my musical night, 
he has said no to come to my engagement.
[29:20] Maheen, how do I know, 
he is fighting with me,
[29:23] not talking to me on the phone, 
he is insulting me.
[29:26] Don’t be naïve,
[29:28] he has blamed me, said so much, 
taking your name.
[29:33] Maheen,
[29:35] am I mad that I instigate him.
[29:37] The messages he is sending me,
[29:39] sending me weird messages,
[29:41] fighting with me on the call,
[29:43] its possible you said something stupid and instigated him.
[29:47] You are responsible you are 
running away, you are blaming me.
[29:52] I have had enough.
[29:59] Yeah right.
[30:07] Umar,
[30:08] have food
[30:10] or else mama will say that I was not home for one 
night and the sister in law didn’t give food to you.
[30:26] Umar.
[30:39] No,
[30:41] so you won’t come with us?
[30:44] I am not going to go, 
don’t even ask me to go.
[30:48] Hey, we won’t. We won’t.
[30:51] I know the pain you are going through,
[30:55] you are facing all this with helplessness,
[30:59] but brother its too late,
[31:01] she belongs to someone else.
[31:03] Why didn’t you tell us before, me and 
Mansoor would have helped you,
[31:07] and told mama and 
papa to take your proposal.
[31:09] One minute,
[31:10] did Maheen said all this to you?
[31:12] No, why would Maheen say this to me, 
am I friends with her?
[31:16] Its all on your face.
[31:19] Yes, now you can sit 
here alone and be sorry.
[31:24] But it doesn’t matter, 
what had to happen, has happened.
[31:28] Nothing happened yet and 
I won’t let anything happen.
[31:31] What would you do? What would you?
[31:33] When it was time, you didn’t say a word,
[31:35] what will you do now? 
Now be patient and forget her.
[31:38] How do I forget her? 
Its not possible to forget her.
[31:41] I will not do this, 
nor will I sit in sorrow.
[31:44] I am waiting for the time, 
the right time, when I stop all this.
[31:48] What do you mean?
[31:49] Are you in your senses?
[31:51] Before you do anything 
stupid think 1000 times.
[31:55] A girl’s respect is delicate,
[31:59] don’t make a filmy move and ruin it. 
Think about it.
[32:05] Come on eat,
[32:06] you don’t get anything 
on an empty stomach.
[32:09] I don’t want to eat.
[32:11] I say get up and eat. 
why are you upset with food?
[32:12] I am not hungry.
[32:14] Fine, do what you want.
[32:15] Its not the time to do good, you get 
upset when I say what is best for you.
[32:26] Hello, where are you people?
[32:28] I have been calling for so long, 
why don’t you answer my phone.
[32:30] Send him immediately, 
there is a lot of work.
[32:34] He is not even answering my phone. 
He has gone mad,
[32:37] you go and get him.
[32:40] Look, I will go
[32:42] but who will do this work?
[32:44] I will have to do it. If mama 
finds out she will get upset.
[32:47] No mama won’t say anything 
I will tell her you went to get my flowers. Go.
[32:53] You will handle it,
[32:58] Hello.
[33:00] Get here immediately.
[33:12] Don’t think I have given up Roshni,
[33:15] if it was not Mahi’s engagement,
[33:18] I would have taught you a lesson.
[33:21] I don’t care about Mahi either,
[33:23] she doesn’t care for me, 
why should I care for her?
[33:29] Shahbaz.
[33:41] Why did you come here?
[33:45] To get you.
[33:47] Look,
[33:49] I have told everyone 
Umar will listen to me.
[33:54] Come with me.
[34:01] Get up from here.
[34:04] I am not well, I won’t go.
[34:06] Come man.
[34:08] Did you not hear me? 
Get up from here, leave.
[34:11] We don’t want  you to work,
[34:15] come on, lets go, get ready.
[34:16] I told you I don’t have to go,
[34:19] you go.
[34:22] What is the matter Umar?
[34:25] You didn’t like what mama said?
[34:28] Look,
[34:30] Mahi is waiting for you.
[34:31] Don’t take her name.
[34:33] its her fault its all cause of her.
[34:37] I am telling you,
[34:39] she knew it all, 
she hid it from everyone.
[34:42] On purpose. Did she tell you?
[34:46] Ok, you didn’t know 
but she knew it all.
[34:49] What did she hide?
[34:52] What did she hide? 
Tell me,
[34:54] Leave it.  Monis,
[34:56] if I tell you you won’t be able to tolerate it.
[34:58] Look, I will find out. Tell me.
[35:04] What will you do knowing?
[35:06] Tell me.
[35:09] Tell me.
[35:13] Okay, so you didn’t like 
what mama or Maheen said,
[35:17] you are hurt. Look, 
I promise, I will fix it all.
[35:23] You will fix it all?
[35:27] Then go right now,
[35:30] and tell aunt Zakia that 
you cannot do this marriage.
[35:35] Where did my wedding come from?
[35:37] It is your wedding that came in the way.
[35:39] Now go, why don’t you?
[35:42] Go, break this wedding, go ahead.
[35:45] What problem do you 
have with my relation?

[35:53] I like her, I love her. 
We love each other for 2 years,
[35:58] she too loves me
[36:00] and We cannot live 
without each other.
[36:04] You don’t believe me.
[36:06] Look,

I also have messages I will show you.
[36:13] Look Monis,

[36:16] I love her, I cannot live without her, 
I will not let you be between us.
[36:23] I will forget everything, 
friendship and relation too.
[36:29] What?
[36:30] I…
