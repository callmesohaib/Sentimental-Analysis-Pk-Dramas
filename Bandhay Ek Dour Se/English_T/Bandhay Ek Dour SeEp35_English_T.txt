[00:20] I am really upset with sister Maheen,
[00:22] she doesn’t want to live in her home and
she didn’t even let my home be settled.
[00:28] Look Fazeela, I respect your emotions,
[00:31] but right now, the mental stress and
torture my sister is going through,
[00:35] you cannot even imagine.
[00:37] All of this are your sister’s actions.
[00:40] Roshni?
[00:41] I cannot expect anything from someone
as cunning as Roshni.
[00:45] But your sister,
[00:46] at least she should have stopped,
[00:48] once we got married,
[00:49] she would have gotten her
husband married again.
[00:52] All this is not that easy for Maheen.
[00:56] If you were in her place…
[00:57] God forbid if I were in her place.
[00:59] Still if I was in her place,
[01:01] I wouldn’t have done something so stupid.
[01:04] Sister Maheen has decided that
she will ruin her own life,
[01:08] she will stay alone,
[01:10] but she wants to do this with all of us,
[01:12] she is ruining the happiness of everyone.
[01:15] And this Roshni?
[01:17] I will not leave this Roshni,
I am telling you!
[01:22] After all, what is left to be done?
[01:25] One decision of Maheen,
[01:27] has tied her brother’s hands
[01:29] and if you look at it,
[01:29] I feel Maheen is more responsible,
than Roshni.
[01:33] Monis, we are not talking about
who is to blame and who not.
[01:37] Right now we are talking about
that my life is ruined.
[01:40] We are not getting married, Monis.
[01:46] One wedding is not happening,
the other is getting ruined.
[01:51] Its all the fault of this wedding,
the wedding has ruined everything!
[05:23] What? Really?
[05:24] They agreed?
[05:28] Or else I was going to tell you a scheme
with which they would agree.
[05:31] Its good it wasn’t needed.
[05:37] What happened?
[05:38] Are you not happy?
[05:41] No.
[05:42] Don’t I look happy?
[05:43] I am happy.
[05:44] Obviously, man.
[05:47] So then tell me,
what date are we fixing?
[05:49] Because my mother is in a hurry,
[05:51] because Maheen’s mother created a scene.
[05:54] So mama is worried that
the people in the locality will find out.
[05:59] She is right.
[06:02] I think my family will come over
to your home in a day or two.
[06:07] By the will of God.
[06:09] Fine.
[06:11] That.
[06:15] We will just have a simple wedding.
[06:19] Why?
[06:21] Its your second wedding,
its my first wedding.
[06:26] I will have some wishes.
[06:29] I know. I understand,
[06:31] but see the situation
we will just get married.
[06:38] Okay, leave it.
[06:39] After all, you will be with me,
so each day will be a celebration.
[06:43] Let these people do what they want.
[06:49] There is something else.
[06:52] What happened now?
[06:58] Papa agreed to the wedding, but
[07:03] he has said that
[07:08] I can get married, but
[07:10] I cannot leave Maheen.
[07:13] Why can’t you leave her?
What do you mean?
[07:17] Lower your voice, everyone is listening.
[07:20] He has put a condition.
[07:23] Did you agree to this condition?
[07:28] Roshni, papa has listened to so much I said,
[07:32] but this is not in my control,
[07:35] its his decision.
[07:41] Roshni.
[07:42] Roshni, what happened?
[07:43] I say leave my hand.
[07:44] Lower your voice, it’s a public place, 
everyone is looking.
[07:47] What are you doing?
[07:49] Okay, man.
[07:51] Okay, sorry. Sit here.
[07:53] Sit and hear me out completely.
[07:57] Sit, please.
[08:08] I have done all that you said,
[08:13] but Mansoor I am scared that
[08:17] if the result turn out to be what you
 told me to, then what will happen.
[08:21] By the will of God,
[08:25] I don’t have hope, I have full confidence.
[08:26] But God forbid,
[08:31] I fear that I in the matter of Maheen,
[08:38] I am not just answerable to God,
[08:40] I am also answerable to my brother,
[08:41] God bless him.
[08:46] If God forbid it doesn’t
 happen as we want it,
[08:53] then you get Maheen freed
 from this nameless relation.
[09:00] We will fulfil her responsibilities
 being a brother, being a father.
[09:06] But I have full hope from God 
that we will not reach this point.
[09:15] By the will of God.
[09:17] By the will of God.
[09:23] I swear to God Roshni,
 there was no other way.
[09:27] Do you have no other way or
 you don’t want to leave Maheen.
[09:33] When is Maheen with me?
[09:36] You leave the one that is with you,
[09:39] she is not with me.
[09:40] Yes, then explain this to your parents,
[09:43] have they gone mad?
[09:46] They are my parents,
[09:48] how are you talking about them.
[09:50] A person shouldn’t be so naïve,
[09:53] to get them to agree to one thing, 
you agreed to ten things they said.
[09:57] You know its so easy to 
emotionally blackmail parents.
[10:00] Lower your voice.
[10:03] How much more do
 I emotionally blackmail papa?
[10:05] I just got married and 
he agreed to my second marriage,
[10:09] who agrees so soon?
[10:10] Tell me.
[10:11] What do I do now?
[10:14] What idiot asks for so much permission?
[10:18] Are you a scared, coward girl 
who is so influenced by their parents,
[10:22] even I won’t be 
so influenced by my parents.
[10:27] I feel Maheen has some motive behind this.
[10:30] What motive will she have?
[10:32] What would interest her?
[10:33] What would she get by living with me,
 when you live in my heart.
[10:37] She will sit in a corner of the house 
and waste her life,
[10:41] and at max what will she do?
[10:43] Care for my old parents, that is it.
[10:50] Roshni, everything gets fine with time.
[11:13] You came back early today.
[11:24] Yes.
[11:26] Did you give Roshni the good news?
[11:33] Yes, I gave her the good news.
[11:39] She must have been really happy.
[12:07] Yes, she is happy.
[12:11] But lesser than you.
[13:00] What motive will she have? 
What would interest her?
[13:04] What would she get by living with me, 
when you live in my heart.
[13:07] She will sit in a corner of the house 
and waste her life,
[13:11] and at max what will she do?
[13:14] Care for my old parents, that is it.
[13:19] Its good she will be one side,
[13:24] at least I will not have 
the responsibilities of Umar’s parents,
[13:29] Maheen will handle her,
 after all she is their beloved.
[13:33] I will tell Umar clearly
[13:35] that if his parents want to keep her close, 
then they should limit her to them.
[13:41] I will spend a year with them,
[13:44] we will see what happens after that later.
[14:52] Grandma you have not prayed for me so long,
[14:58] you didn’t blow any prayers on me, either.
[15:03] You pray for your own,
[15:07] who are we to you?
[15:14] Will you people always stay 
upset with me like this?
[15:17] Why do you care?
[15:19] What you want is happening.
[15:23] You were upset on your wedding,
[15:25] now go,
[15:26] Dance, get on a horse,
[15:28] become a groom.
[15:35] I don’t know grandma, 
I feel that something is not complete.
[15:44] I need your prayer,
[15:47] you pray for me, that’s it.
[15:49] All of you think that I am really happy,
[15:53] but that is not true.
[15:55] There is a weird restlessness,
[15:57] I am restless,
[16:00] I feel suffocated.
[16:04] I feel suffocated, it feels weird.
[16:09] Look Umar,
[16:11] you are not bad at heart,
[16:14] those who are bad at heart,
[16:17] they don’t care for others in their happiness, 
that they are upset or sad.
[16:23] But you are not happy on the inside 
because others are upset,
[16:28] others are sad.
[16:31] Don’t do this my son.
[16:34] Don’t do it.
[16:36] You will stay worried all your life,
 you will feel suffocated all your life.
[16:45] I don’t know grandma,
[16:47] there is restlessness on both ends,
[16:52] it’s a weird feeling on both sides.
[16:59] I think that
[17:03] if Roshni does something wrong
 because of me, then?
[17:11] If she gets defamed because of me,
[17:14] will I ever be able to forgive myself,
[17:16] will I ever be able to stay happy all my life.
[17:19] What more will she do wrong?
[17:22] But her parents are there to care for her,
[17:25] she has her beloved.
[17:28] We have to care for our Maheen.
[17:31] Go.
[17:33] You go.
[17:35] You go to Roshni. Go.
[17:41] Grandma pray for me.
[17:43] Will you leave or not?
[17:44] Go. Get lost.
[18:43] Umar, she went for a few days,
[18:48] did you see your condition?
[18:52] You say that you have not accepted her 
as your wife with your heart,
[18:59] but you couldn’t tolerate her leaving you.
[19:07] This is what has upset you,
[19:10] that how did she think of separating from you.
[19:19] Think when Maheen told you that 
she won’t live with you at any cost,
[19:26] and she dislikes you,
[19:29] then why did you feel so hurt?
[19:32] And when she is not stopping you
 from becoming someone else’s
[19:37] then why are you so disappointed?
[19:42] Why do you want that she stops you?
[19:46] What do you want her to say?
[19:52] Think Umar.
[19:56] Think.
[20:30] I heard your voice and I got scared.
[20:33] You were really worried?
[20:37] Roshni, I don’t know 
I wanted to be with you.
[20:42] I am with you,
[20:44] where do I have to go?
[20:46] Its just that I got upset on
 something you said yesterday.
[20:52] What can I do now?
[20:55] I cannot stay upset with you for long
[20:58] and Umar,
[21:00] I realize your worries and tensions.
[21:05] Thank you Roshni.
[21:07] Umar, I am doing so much for you,
[21:12] so I want that you do something in return.
[21:21] Living with Maheen in that 
room will be really difficult for me.
[21:29] Roshni,
[21:32] I don’t have any other option
[21:35] and then Maheen will not 
be an issue for you and me.
[21:41] And your parents,
[21:43] who hate me.
[21:45] After the marriage you won’t be 
there twenty four hours to protect me.
[21:51] I don’t know 
what I will have to go through.
[21:54] Not at all.
[21:56] There is nothing like 
what you are thinking.
[21:58] This will happen.
[22:01] I cannot face this torture day and night.
[22:03] I don’t want to face so much.
[22:05] Umar,
[22:06] you will have to make arrangements for this.
[22:10] Roshni, I…
[22:13] I have not thought about this, 
nor can I do something
[22:19] and then in this condition,
[22:22] mama and papa are still not well.
[22:26] They will not get well.
[22:33] I mean that
[22:36] you see their age, they are old
[22:39] and these ailments will continue this doesn’t mean 
that I stay in torture all day long.
[22:46] They show love to Maheen,
[22:49] and I get upset all the time.
[22:51] I don’t want this life.
[22:53] Is this how you will repay me 
for my patience and courage?
[23:01] But Roshni, one thing is decided
[23:04] that I cannot leave mama and papa.
[23:09] Fine,
[23:10] don’t leave them,
[23:12] but we don’t need to get involved 
with them and live.
[23:16] Your brother also lives 
with them in that home,
[23:18] in a separate portion,
[23:20] we will do the same.
[23:22] The beloved daughter in law they are happy with,
[23:25] they should live with her.
[23:30] Its your decision, right?
[23:32] Then go yourself.
[23:34] To talk about these matters,
[23:36] you need a woman.
[23:38] Mama, Razia is unwell, you come along.
[23:42] I will not go.
[23:44] Why don’t you people understand?
[23:46] I am not doing all this by my own will.
[23:50] Razia, mama,
[23:51] we are in that time of our lives where we can explain 
what is good and bad to the children,
[23:55] we cannot force them.
[23:57] If he didn’t understand, 
I am supporting him in my helplessness.
[23:59] What helplessness?
[24:02] I am more upset on you than him.
[24:04] Hey, he is doing what he is, 
but you don’t stay on the front line.
[24:08] And you shouldn’t involve us either.
[24:09] That’s it. 
Yes.
[24:11] You know if he takes this extreme measure.
[24:14] The son will go away from us, Razia!
[24:18] I have tried to save this house, 
so that he doesn’t rebel or hate us.
[24:24] This way he will stay with us at least,
[24:27] he will realize this in his heart 
that even with a heavy heart,
[24:32] we accepted whatever he said.
[24:33] What did we agree to?
[24:35] He made us agree to it.
[24:39] I will also make him agree.
[24:41] He will agree by the will of God.
[24:43] What is there to agree to?
[24:45] There is something.
[24:46] There is no point in 
telling you people the detail,
[24:48] you get emotional on everything.
[24:52] Hear me out,
[24:53] we have to go with
 the proposal in a day or two and…
[24:56] We don’t have to go.
[25:10] Roshni, I don’t think I am able to 
make you understand properly.
[25:15] You...
[25:17] You know that in the top 
portion brother Mansoor lives,
[25:23] there are only two rooms there,
[25:25] and he has them both,
[25:27] sister in law and brother Mansoor.
[25:29] So how can we live there?
[25:32] And then sister in law’s temperament is such…
[25:37] Who is living with your sister in law, Najia.
[25:40] Throw them out,
[25:42] Get that portion empty,
[25:44] we will live there.
[25:48] This is not possible Roshni.
[25:49] You try and understand Umar,
[25:52] you handle your father’s business,
[25:55] he is bed ridden now,
[25:58] he will only pray now.
[25:59] Understand your position.
[26:02] You can make them agree
 to anything you say to,
[26:05] pressurize them.
[26:06] Tell them that if they don’t empty that portion,
[26:10] then you will leave the home.
[26:12] What is wrong in that?
[26:15] When they see the business sinking, 
they will all agree.
[26:20] When you are not able to get food to eat, 
everyone will come to their senses.
[26:24] The one who is earning, running the home,
[26:26] what he wants should happen.
[26:35] Our elders have done a lot of favors on us,
[26:39] those that I wouldn’t have 
been able to pay all my life,
[26:44] but now,
[26:45] God has given me a chance to 
respond to that love somehow.
[26:52] After all what better can I get than living 
under the shadow of uncle and aunt’s love?
[27:54] Okay, then fine,
[27:57] I will come along with you,
[28:00] I will ask for the proposal later,
[28:02] I will insult her first.
[28:04] For God’s sake mama.
[28:08] Mama,
[28:10] then I will come along,
[28:11] her mother should be treated too.
[28:14] You people forgive me,
[28:17] I will go alone.
[28:19] I thought that a woman of the home would
 come along it would have been easier,
[28:23] but your intentions…
[28:28] Uncle,
[28:31] I will come with you.
[28:39] Damn it!
[29:11] Umar, what happened? 
You called me in such an emergency.
[29:14] Umar?
[29:17] Brother Mansoor, I have found
 the answers to all the questions.
[29:20] The question that you put in my heart.
[29:24] I have found out.
[29:26] What have you found out?
[29:28] That I am not entangled in Roshni’s love,
[29:32] but in the promises I made,
[29:36] I don’t have fear of going away from her,
[29:41] I am afraid of the blame of being 
called unfaithful and a cheat.
[29:45] I don’t wish to live with her,
[29:48] but I care for her.
[29:51] I feel that I made a promise to her,
[29:54] if I go away from her, she will take her life.
[29:58] I don’t love her.
[30:00] This is not love.
[30:02] This is just a burden,
[30:05] that suffocates me.
[30:09] Who do you love?
[30:11] Did you find the answer to this?
[30:17] The answer is in front of me,
[30:20] I kept on looking away,
[30:25] I used to feel ashamed.
[30:28] I claimed to love a girl,
[30:32] made her wait for me,
[30:34] then I fell in love with someone else.
[30:38] But brother Mansoor, 
I cannot take it anymore,
[30:40] I want to get rid of this burden.
[30:45] Umar, I was waiting for this moment,
[30:49] go and tell Maheen
[30:52] that you have learned 
the difference between illusion and love.
[31:00] How can I tell Maheen?
[31:04] What will she think about me?
[31:06] She knows everything about me and Roshni.
[31:09] She knows my madness.
[31:10] She will think that the things
 I used to say to Roshni,
[31:12] I am saying to her.
[31:13] How will she believe me?
[31:16] Umar, you have wasted a lot of time, 
in these ifs and buts.
[31:21] These useless misconceptions,
[31:24] don’t waste time in those,
[31:27] go and tell her.
[31:30] Should I?
[31:31] Yes, right now, this very moment.
[31:38] And Roshni?
[31:41] Its clear to you who you love,
[31:46] then also decide that
 who do you care about the most?
[31:52] The one you decide about do think about it,
[31:58] that the one you care about, is she worth it.
[32:05] Roshni is not worth this.
[32:07] She is not worth it.
[32:10] I agree that her emotion is real, 
she must love me,
[32:18] but the people I love,
[32:21] who are attached to me,
[32:22] if she cannot love them, 
then I cannot add her to my life.
[32:28] Then go.
[32:30] Go right now to Maheen and tell her.
[32:35] Take out the fear from inside you.
[32:41] Go.
[32:47] Thank you brother Mansoor.
[32:49] Thank you.
[32:52] Thank you.
[33:55] What happened, papa?
[33:59] Is everything ok at home?
[34:01] Mama.
[34:04] What happened to you?
[34:06] Why are you crying?
[34:08] Someone tell me, what happened?
[34:11] We have fixed the proposal
 and also the wedding date.
[34:17] After four days you 
and Roshni will get married.
[34:34] What?
[34:35] So soon?
[34:36] You also fixed the wedding date?
[34:38] What sort of people are they? 
They couldn’t tell us before coming.
[34:41] You knew when those people are coming,
[34:43] you should have stayed at home,
[34:45] but you cannot stay at home.
[34:47] They are weird,
[34:48] they didn’t even meet me 
and nothing else,
[34:50] and my mother is the most weird,
[34:54] that is so tired of me that
[34:56] she met them for the first time, 
and fixed the date of the wedding.
[34:58] They must not want to meet you.
[35:01] The way we are getting this
wedding done with a dead heart,
[35:03] they must be doing so as well.
[35:06] And you leave everything,
[35:07] you are happy,
[35:09] your wish is complete.
[35:11] Now what do you want?
[35:13] Should we dance over this defamation?
[35:16] Mama, there was no need to be so hasty.
[35:21] You failed all my planning.
[35:25] Right now I had to get 
Umar agree to so much,
[35:27] make him agree to a lot of my conditions.
[35:29] Now how will I pressurize him
 after the marriage?
[35:35] Roshni,
[35:37] I don’t see any signs of you 
wanting to live in that home.
[35:43] Look,
[35:45] you have fallen in love,
[35:52] take your respect and leave.
[35:57] If this is how you will behave,
[36:00] you will come sit on this door.
[36:03] See this,
[36:05] come to your senses.
