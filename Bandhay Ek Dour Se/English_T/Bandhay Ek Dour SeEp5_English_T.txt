[00:20] Come downstairs,
[00:22] come on, the cat will catch you.
[00:23] What happened Mahi?
I was waiting for your call.
[00:27] Yes,
[00:28] sorry,
[00:30] I was busy with work at
home and forgot to call.
[00:32] Meaning, when its my job,
you got busy. You forgot.
[00:36] It was a small thing,
[00:38] I just said deliver the gift and
let me talk to her from your phone.
[00:42] She told me not to call,
she doesn’t have an issue with you calling.
[00:46] Umar,
[00:47] whether you do it this way
or that way, it’s the same.
[00:50] When she said no to talk to you,
then you know what that means.
[00:55] Yes, but I wanted to wish her
on her birthday. Try and understand.
[01:02] You promised not to call right,
she didn’t.
[01:05] if she wants, she can call you.
[01:11] She is a little stubborn.
[01:14] Anyway, if she is not stubborn with me,
who would she be stubborn with.
[01:18] Tell me, how did she like the gift?
[01:25] Speak up.
[01:27] That…mama was unwell,
so I couldn’t give her the gift.
[01:34] Here you go!
[01:35] I gave you one small task,
you couldn’t do that.
[01:39] Sorry, I will give the gift.
[01:42] Promise.
[01:44] Umar, don’t get upset.
[01:52] Hey stay at home on the holiday,
you are ready to leave again.
[01:56] I have just one off day,
I have a 1000 things to do.
[02:00] Go madam, do you work,
[02:03] I don’t want you to sit with me,
[02:06] I am talking about Mansoor,
[02:07] he should spend time
with us on the off day,
[02:13] Mama, why…
[02:14] Hello aunt!
[02:22] Hello sister in law, how are you?
[02:23] Me? I am like this.
[02:30] If you don’t miss your train,
go make me cup of tea before you go.
[02:35] Sure.
[02:36] Come.
[02:36] Where is grandma?
[02:37] Where would grandma be?
[02:40] I have to sit alone on a holiday,
[02:43] my son is taken away by his wife,
and the husband with his mother,
[02:46] God knows what shrine they want to.
[02:54] Najia, get tea quickly.
[02:59] Why tea in such hot weather.
[03:02] Headaches don’t care about hot or cold weather.
[03:04] I will have tea, I will feel better.
[03:08] Najia, just get one cup of tea,
Monis is feeling hot.
[03:16] Okay, Monis, tell me more,
how is aunt?
[03:19] Mama is fine nowadays.
[03:23] Yes, she only gets other unwell.
[03:29] No, I get that, but you hear me child.
[03:33] Hello.
[03:37] Oh no, he is saying,
he is coming to get you.
[03:43] What? Such a good news.
[03:45] Mama, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.
I will tell you that I will go for sure.
[03:50] Are you mad?
[03:52] How do I let you go with a single man alone?
[03:56] What alone travel.
[03:58] He will take me on the plane,
it won’t be empty, there will be people.
[04:02] Aunt Shahista is calling me
and I don’t go anywhere.
[04:08] Please.
[04:10] Be quiet and sit, you have never stayed
with your uncle and aunt, but you will go here.
[04:15] Tell me something,
[04:17] there is no girl your age in Shahista’s
home, what would you do there?
[04:21] Oh mama, I don’t get it what
girls have smart mothers.
[04:27] Don’t you get it? Aunt
Shahista is being nice to me,
[04:32] why is she calling me there, and
how many times she told you she likes me.
[04:39] Okay, so this is the deal.
[04:43] Then it will look even worse
living there like this.
[04:47] Mama, they are modern people,
[04:51] they don’t care about such things.
[04:53] She wants that before marriage,
[04:57] I see the environment of their home,
them. Its good for me.
[05:01] That is fine,
[05:04] but if they send the proposal properly,
it would have been good.
[05:07] Mama,
[05:08] they will send the proposal,
[05:10] you first give me the permission.
[05:13] I feel you gave me permission,
[05:16] I am going to go pack,
you too come quick.
[05:18] Roshni!
[05:30] Aunt, mama has sent this
card for Mahi’s wedding.
[05:35] God damn it!
[05:36] This is the respect of sister in law and brother
in law that kids are bringing us invitations.
[05:41] Aunt, mama will come,
she will surely come,
[05:43] she was a little busy.
[05:45] If she had to come herself,
why would she send the card through you?
[05:48] This is how she respected us.
[05:50] Mama,
[05:51] Monis came thinking
he would meet his aunt this way.
[05:55] You be quiet.
[05:56] You take this card and go back and return
it to the one who loses her respect coming here.
[06:02] Aunt, I came with a lot of hope,
[06:04] what will I say going back?
[06:05] Say anything, go to hell.
[06:08] Mama…
[06:11] you come to my room,
we will go upstairs.
[06:17] Monis…
[06:19] Umar, I say be quiet.
[06:22] Hey, at least, respect the guest
who has come to your home.
[06:25] My home. My guest.
[06:27] You go madam, go and roam on
the streets with my beloved son. Go.
[06:32] This is the limit,
talking this home is a pain.
[06:35] Then don’t!
[06:36] I am not!
[06:37] Mama, what did you do?
[06:39] Be quiet.
[06:41] You shouldn’t have sent
Monis away like this.
[06:43] I say be quiet.
[06:46] You shouldn’t have done this.
[06:50] Auhhuumm,
[06:51] Damn it, the tea is without sugar,
its poison!
[06:54] I will get you tea.
[07:18] Hello.
[07:19] Brother Monis, listen…
[07:20] I am driving the bike,
I will talk to you when I get home.
[07:22] I have told you
so many times not to call.
[07:26] I can hear the bike, hello,
[07:28] hello, you didn’t cut the call,
[07:31] hello. Hello?
[07:35] Hello,
[07:37] brother Monis.
[07:44] Hello.
[07:46] Hello.
[07:48] Brother Monis, hello,
can you hear me?
[07:51] Mama. Mama!
[07:58] Could you not wait for me to come back,
[08:00] what was the point of dragging the
kids in the personal matter?
[08:03] I didn’t drag her,
[08:04] Zakia sent Monis,
[08:06] you tell me honestly,
[08:09] wasn’t it something that would angry you.
[08:12] Fine,
[08:14] you should have complained,
[08:15] told him you didn’t like it.
[08:16] You could have told me.
[08:18] I would have insulted Zakia myself asking
her this is no way to invite someone to the wedding.
[08:20] Why did you insult that
kid and send him away.
[08:22] I didn’t insult him.
[08:24] Don’t lie Razia,
[08:27] Najia told me everything.
[08:30] You not only told him to go to hell,
[08:34] you were even cursing him for 2-3 days.
[08:37] Fear God.
[08:39] You have kids,
[08:41] he is a kid, he is an orphan, he is my blood.
[08:44] I will teach Najia a lesson,
[08:47] first she turns my son against me and
then she also instigates my husband.
[08:51] Papa.
[08:53] Papa. Monis had
a serious accident.
[09:06] I don’t know,
[09:07] I don’t know what condition my son is in.
[09:09] Oh God. Oh God.
God have mercy.
[09:11] Grandma, have water,
it will all be fine by the will of God.
[09:15] Where is Mansoor?
[09:17] I had to go to the hospital,
where is he?
[09:19] He is coming. He is coming.
He is parking the car and coming. Mansoor.
[09:25] Okay, I got the car,
[09:27] whoever wants to go to
the hospital come.
[09:28] Son, I want to go,
take me to the hospital.
[09:31] God knows
what my son is going through.
[09:34] Grandma. Grandma, I spoke to papa,
all is fine, nothing to worry about.
[09:40] Oh God.
[09:41] Come on mama, come.
[09:43] oh God.
[09:44] This is why they say
you shouldn’t curse people,
[09:47] at times what you say is accepted.
[09:50] You stay quiet Najia,
this is not the time to say these things.
[09:52] She has gotten up and left,
she has a stone heart.
[09:58] Grandma, what…
[10:00] I don’t have a stone heart,
[10:03] I am a mother,
[10:05] not a snake.
[10:08] He played with my Umar in my lap.
[10:14] Mansoor’s father left
alone worried in a hurry,
[10:17] I was going to get money.
[10:19] You may need it there mama,
I will just be back.
[10:27] She is not bad at heart,
[10:29] she just cant control her tongue.
[10:31] Come son, come quick.
[10:34] Come grandma, come.
[10:45] Come here.
[10:49] Sit down Zakia.
[11:03] My son has bad luck.
[11:07] I don’t know how a widow like me had
done preparations to marry off my daughter.
[11:16] God be kind.
[11:19] May He give my son health,
[11:24] so that he is there for Mahi’s wedding.
[11:27] Yes, God willing. Monis is fine,
he has regained consciousness. He will be fine.
[11:34] God give Umar a long life,
[11:38] may he get what he want,
[11:39] he has supported us in this tough time
[11:43] He is our own blood Zakia,
wont he be of use in such a time?
[11:51] When will they release
him from the hospital.
[11:53] At max 2 days.
[11:54] 2 days?
[11:55] There is a lot of work at home for the wedding
and we are here at the hospital.
[11:59] God is kind.
[12:02] Yes, thank God,
he gave our son a new life.
[12:09] Ok, this is the last spoon.
Come on. Okay.
[12:17] Hey Umar, thank you.
[12:21] I have heard that you made a
lot of effort to arrange the blood.
[12:26] I gave two bottles of blood,
[12:28] I will make you pay for it.
Do you get it?
[12:34] Where is your mobile?
[12:35] Should I take a picture?
I will send it to sister in law.
[12:37] No man, not a picture.
[12:39] If you send a picture in this condition,
she must be crying already.
[12:47] Okay, then you rest for a while.
[12:51] No, I want to talk to you.
Ouch. Ouch.
[12:58] Yes, the preparation will be done.
[13:02] Hello. I will keep my preparation ready,
[13:05] as soon as you are done with your work,
[13:08] I will come pick you up, okay?
Bye. Here you go.
[13:12] Damn it, come here.
[13:14] When I was talking,
why did you take the phone from me?
[13:17] You finalized everything yourself.
[13:19] Mama, you just gave permission,
why are you saying no?
[13:22] So how was I to know that their wedding will
also come on the days when Mahi is getting married.
[13:27] You tell me something,
[13:28] she is your childhood friend,
wont you participate in her wedding?
[13:32] Mama,
[13:33] her brother had an accident and is in the hospital,
[13:36] they will not get married in a week or 10 days.
[13:39] They will extend it.
[13:40] I would have said no to Nabeel
[13:41] and then we found out the
wedding got postponed, how would I go then?
[13:45] I can never travel
in the plane anyway,
[13:47] you would never
let me take a train alone.
[13:51] You are really strong headed,
get lost.
[13:53] Listen,
[13:55] my lovely mother,
[13:56] you know they are holding a
big function for the home.
[14:00] Get me good clothes made.
[14:02] Okay.
[14:04] The clothes you got made for Mahi’s wedding,
you will wear those only.
[14:09] Mama, I cannot wear wedding clothes to a function.
People will call me a villager.
[14:13] Go now.
[14:15] Mama.
[14:16] Mama, my love, listen to me.
[14:22] Thank God brother is fine now,
[14:25] I was worried.
[14:27] Yes, God is great.
[14:35] We still have some worries too.
[14:38] Mahi, give me this tea,
[14:40] I will give this to Razia and brother Fareed,
they are all standing there.
[14:50] Okay listen,
[14:51] there was some money at home, I got it,
you spend all the money for the hospital.
[14:56] Yes, that is good. I spent all the money
I had on the operation and medicine.
[15:02] Yes, we will do more, don’t worry,
Zakia might not have money.
[15:06] She must have spent it in the
daughter’s wedding.
[15:09] Something will be done.
[15:11] Monis is like our younger brother,
we will do something. Don’t worry.
[15:15] God willing.
[15:17] God willing,
all will be fine, don’t worry.
[15:23] Hey…
[15:24] Hey, what was the need for it?
[15:25] I got this for uncle, you take it.
[15:26] Thank you.
[17:27] It feels like aunt Zakia
and mama never fought,
[17:30] they have developed
a strong bond.
[17:33] I used to tell you earlier,
my mother is not bad at heart
[17:38] and love wins everything.
[17:43] If you treat her with love,
[17:46] you will get love in return.
[17:49] Leave it. Forget about it,
[17:51] this is not love, its embarrassment.
[17:53] She knows that her
curses almost killed Monis,
[17:58] she is making amends.
[18:02] Okay, this is good too,
[18:04] or else in today’s world,
[18:07] people are not embarrassed on
their actions or make amends.
[18:13] As far as sister Zakia is concerned,
spend money and win her heart.
[18:18] She had to melt,
[18:20] papa made the expense,
[18:22] and that was right.
[18:24] I just say that if this had to happen,
[18:26] I wish it happened earlier,
[18:32] we would have gotten
Umar married there, right?
[18:45] Why do you have the long face?
[18:47] You should be happy
[18:48] your brother is home fine,
your wedding date didn’t get pushed either.
[18:54] You are joking, right?
[18:56] How is this possible that you
will leave my wedding and go?
[19:00] What can I do man?
[19:01] Aunt Shahista kept the
wedding on the same date.
[19:03] Now I cannot get the function date pushed
asking aunt Shahista, that is not in my hand.
[19:08] You have going or not
going in your hands, don’t go.
[19:12] How can I not go?
[19:13] You are getting married,
[19:15] I need to think about my wedding too.
[19:21] Wedding?
[19:25] Man, the thing is that aunt SHahista
chose me for Nabeel,
[19:30] so she is forcing me to come
and meet her relatives,
[19:32] see how they live. One thing is for sure,
[19:37] our ways of living is different,
[19:40] but I know myself, I can adjust.
[19:44] Roshni,
[19:46] Umar!
[19:48] What Umar?
[19:50] What Umar?
[19:51] You forgot so soon what Umar?
[19:54] Man, I will not wait for 
Umar and grow old.
[19:57] For Nabeel’s proposal 
my parents agree,
[20:00] how do I say no? 
Umar doesn’t have a job,
[20:05] nor is he becoming capable to
bring the proposal to my home.
[20:09] You are being hasty, don’t be hasty,
[20:13] all is getting fine now.
[20:15] Umar goes to work, 
he will also get a job,
[20:17] the family will agree.
[20:19] I will talk to mama, 
we will bring your proposal.
[20:21] My parents have to 
accept the proposal,
[20:24] why would they prefer 
Umar over Nabeel?
[20:27] Everyone wants what is
best for their daughter.
[20:32] Why don’t you say you
think what is best for you.
[20:36] Think that,
[20:38] what is wrong in that?
[20:40] He loves you.
[20:41] Nabeel too loves me.
[20:43] Loves me?
[20:45] He will die.
[20:46] He wont die,
[20:47] he is alive,
[20:49] he is smart enough to know
that I am taking myself away from him.
[20:53] That is why he moved away from me,
so he has his respect.
[20:57] He hopes…
You can end his hope,
[21:00] you have my permission.
[21:07] What if I cannot come to your wedding,
[21:09] my prayers are with you.
[21:25] Are you blind?
[21:26] Cant you see the car?
[21:27] Are you blind?
[21:29] When I am coming from this way,
you move your car.
[21:32] Weird people,
[21:33] they don’t know how to drive
and they take cars on the road.
[21:39] What?
[22:26] Razia.
[22:28] Razia.
[22:30] Give me my warm shawl.
[22:33] Zakia’s open his open,
there is wind blowing.
[22:39] Wow grandma, preparing hard.
[22:44] Farid said come early,
[22:46] it will be great.
I too will fulfill my wishes.
[22:51] Look what I got for you.
[22:53] For me?
[22:54] Yeah.
[22:54] Wow,
[22:56] perfume.
[22:57] Yes,
[22:57] I thought my grandma should
look her best for the wedding.
[23:03] What if you find a girl you like for me,
[23:05] then when you ask for the proposal
wearing this perfume, it will be great.
[23:08] You really want to get married?
[23:11] Me?
[23:11] Yes.
[23:12] Not me, you really want 
me to get married,
[23:15] I want to fulfill your wish,
my lovely grandma
[23:23] Some more days Roshni,
[23:25] you won’t even know I have
moved a lot of stones from the way,
[23:29] I will give you this news myself.
[23:35] Umar.
[23:37] Where are you right now?
[23:39] Listen to me. Come here soon.
[23:41] What happened Maheen,
all ok? Is Monis fine?
[23:45] Give it to me, I will talk.
[23:47] Talk to grandma.
[23:51] Hello. Yes child,
[23:54] how are you?
[23:56] How is your brother? All ok?
[24:00] Oh, grandma is dying
to meet you two.
[24:07] Yes, its fine. Child,
don’t worry, I am coming.
[24:11] Okay child, bye.
[24:59] Umar, come down.
[25:01] What happened man?
Why are you not letting me go?
[25:04] I cannot wait, 
I need to meet her.
[25:06] I cannot wait anymore,
[25:08] how many challenges do I take on,
how many bridges to I make.
[25:14] hey,
[25:15] She told me to meet when there is
a good news, now I have a good news.
[25:20] Why don’t you want me to meet her?
[25:23] Tell me.
Why are you not speaking?
[25:25] You are not letting me speak.
[25:27] Okay, do one thing,
[25:29] message her to meet me on the roof,
[25:31] don’t tell her about me,
[25:34] I will surprise her
[25:38] she will be happy. Right?
[25:39] I don’t know.
[25:42] What do you mean, you don’t know?
She will obviously be happy,
[25:45] grandma has come with the
mission to find a girl for me.
[25:50] You have to do something for me,
[25:52] take her in front of grandma often.
I want her to be in grandma’s focus,
[25:57] rest is my magic.
[26:03] What man?
[26:05] What happened to you?
[26:06] You promised to make us meet,
why are you moving back.
[26:10] I am not moving back.
[26:12] Oh
[26:14] madam is throwing tantrums,
[26:16] she is getting married,
[26:18] she has dreams, she is busy.
[26:22] Okay, don’t do anything,
message her to meet me on the roof.
[26:28] She won’t come to the roof,
[26:31] she won’t come to the wedding.
[26:35] What happened?
Did you two fight?
[26:39] I wish I had fought,
[26:41] when people fight they separate,
no one separates without a fight.
[26:47] Why don’t you talk openly?
What is the issue, tell me.
[26:55] Listen to me.
[26:58] Someone relative of his,
[27:02] distant relatives,
[27:04] she has gone to meet him,
[27:07] a cousin of her came to meet her,
[27:10] he took her,
[27:13] she is getting close to him and…
[27:19] What nonsense Maheen?
[27:22] What are you saying about Roshni?
That too, to me.
[27:25] No.
[27:26] I trust her completely.
She only loves me and you…
[27:34] Roshni said right,
[27:36] you will create
misunderstanding between us,
[27:39] she was right,
[27:40] I didn’t expect this  from you,
you should have supported me.
[27:45] Damn it.
[27:53] I knew you wouldn’t believe me.
[28:13] When will we reach?
How long will it take?
[28:19] The journey is long,
[28:20] this one as well as life.
You are tired already?
[28:24] No, I am not tired,
[28:26] the car is really comfortable that
I don’t know about the time passing.
[28:32] So all the magic is in my car,
so what about my company?
[28:37] No, I meant that you are here,
[28:40] so everything is
so good or else nothing
[28:47] You know I could have
sent you a plane ticket
[28:50] and called you,
but I recently imported this car, so I came.
[28:55] I am sorry, I know this
would be hectic for you.
[28:59] No I am fine, after all,
[29:02] I will go home and rest.

You too have come right now.
[33:52] Are you not tired since morning?
[33:54] No, I don’t get tired,
[33:56] aunt Shahista gave me the responsibility
for handling two rooms.
[34:00] Actually uncle is coming,
[34:02] and he is really fussy about things,
[34:04] so mama is conscious.
[34:06] She wants everything to be perfect.
[34:08] Aunt never thought of me like that,
[34:11] I am also a guest,
[34:12] God knows where aunt
is and you came at 12.
[34:17] Okay,
[34:19] you consider us your guests?
[34:21] You are our own,
[34:24] specially mama thinks you are our own.
[34:28] I didn’t know that you will
have complaints like strangers.
[34:35] Okay, did you eat?
[34:36] No, I am hungry.
[34:39] Lets order pizza.
[34:41] Chicken Tikka.
[34:43] Yes.
[34:53] I came here with the hope to meet you,
[34:56] the dream to make you mine,
[34:57] the dream will come

[35:00] you might have left disappointed,
[35:02] please come back,
I am waiting for you.
[35:05] Do you want something else?
[35:09] Nothing.
[35:10] No thanks.

[35:19] Your pizza is coming,
I will go change.
[35:41] Humm,
[35:42] Yeah,
[35:43] Man, Maheen,
[35:44] I had told you earlier to
tell him not message me,
[35:49] I am busy, I don’t
want to talk to him.
[35:51] On top of that,
he is so cheap, class.
[35:56] You tell him yourself,
[35:59] tell him that I am happy seeing
someone’s money and home,
[36:04] we cannot live together, sorry.
[36:06] Hello,
[36:08] two proposals came for you too,
[36:10] one had a general store and a rental home,
[36:13] the other was an employee at WAPDA,
had his own home and a government home,
[36:17] who did you say yes too?
[36:18] One minute, one minute Roshni.
[36:22] First thing,
[36:24] I didn’t give anyone hope
or gave them false hope,
[36:28] my mother kept both these proposals in
front of me, and the decision was her too.
[36:32] Man ,don’t be sarcastic.
[36:35] Tell him not message me,
[36:38] I don’t want to talk to him tell
him to forget me, ok?
[36:42] or I will treat him bad.
[36:44] What worse can you do Roshni?
[36:47] Because of you,
[36:49] he won’t be able to leave the wedding,
[36:51] nor will he be able to fake a smile in front of people.
[36:54] His heart will be broken,
he won’t be able to do anything.
[36:57] I am putting down the phone. Bye.
[37:00] Hello.
[37:01] Hello.
[37:04] Oh well.
[37:08] Ahhhh,
[37:16] Oh God, the swimming pool.
