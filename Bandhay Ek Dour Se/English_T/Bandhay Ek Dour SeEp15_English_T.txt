[00:21] Mama look at Umar,
he looks like a unique groom.
[00:25] Yeah, look at his face, he is so lost.
[00:29] All this happened all of a sudden,
but the reception…
[00:34] Mama, look at this picture of your son
with Afzal uncle, he looks so happy.
[00:40] Yeah.
[00:41] Although he created a scene at aunt Ruqaiya’s home.
[00:45] Fareed is really stupid.
[00:48] Not a single picture of the bride
and groom is worth enlarging,
[00:54] I paid the photographer for no reason,
I could have taken pictures from my phone.
[00:57] Yeah, true.
[00:57] I will ask Umar to go to a studio
and get a photo shoot done.
[01:01] Yes, than that picture,
I will place here. Right here.
[01:05] Yeah.
[01:09] I will put it up here.
[01:11] Yes, here.
[01:11] It won’t be that big,
you wanted to cover the window.
[01:14] Yes, only this portion.
[01:52] Roshni was asking about you.
[01:59] In fact, when she asked,
I realized I never asked you.
[02:06] What?
[02:09] That, are you happy or not?
[02:34] I am happy.
[02:36] Why won’t I be happy?
[02:40] Now she will ask you,
[02:44] why am I happy?
[02:47] Tell her that because you
don’t consider me responsible for all this.
[03:00] Maheen, the three of us are suffering for no reason.
[03:07] How long will we suffer?
[03:11] I don’t know when this punishment will end.
[03:17] You know,
[03:19] Roshni is less helpless as compared to us,
[03:25] she can free herself from this hell and punishment,
[03:31] if you set her free from yourself.
[03:44] Maheen, I cannot do this at any cost.
[03:46] Umar, don’t take me wrong,
[03:49] I don’t have an issue with Roshni’s existence.
[03:51] Umar, I know she is hurt,
[03:55] but if she forgets all this
[04:00] and starts a new life,
[04:04] then the burden on your heart will reduce
and new doors will open for her.
[04:15] She wants to sit on the same door and wait for me.
[04:24] If I cannot make her mine,
[04:28] then I cannot even force her to give up loving me.
[04:40] She hopes that our love will have results,
[04:49] she feels that
[04:54] the two of us will become one, someday.
[05:34] Roshni.
[05:37] Roshni.
[05:41] Can you not hear me?
[05:45] Uh-huh.
[05:48] You tell me, did you go to meet Maheen?
[05:51] Yeah I did, what happened?
[05:54] No actually I met Zakia and I mentioned you.
[06:00] Zakia called Maheen at that moment,
[06:03] Maheen said that Roshni
didn’t come to her in-laws to meet her.
[06:06] I didn’t go to meet her at the in-laws.
[06:09] But,
[06:12] Zakia is saying that Maheen is saying that
she has not met Roshni in a long time,
[06:18] so who do you go to meet 2-3 times in a week?
[06:21] You know, I was embarrassed in front of Razia,
[06:25] I told her it must have been Shaheen,
[06:28] I must have misheard.
[06:30] Mama, I don’t get it,
[06:32] why do you want to talk
to everyone about everything?
[06:37] Roshni, tell me honestly,
[06:39] who do you go to meet?
[06:41] Look, I am not the type of mother
who covers up for their children.
[06:46] Yes mama,
[06:47] you are the mother who ruins children
by telling their actions.
[06:52] Why would I lie to you?
[06:54] Maheen is the one lying.
[06:56] Why would she lie?
[06:58] And that too, to her mother?
[06:59] Mama, her in-laws are really bad,
[07:03] they don’t let her go out,
[07:05] and there is no chance she can meet her friends.
[07:08] She makes an excuse of going to her mother’s,
[07:10] and meets me.
[07:12] When aunt Zakia called her damned
mother in law must be there with her,
[07:17] how would she tell the truth.
[07:19] Hmmm…
[07:21] but tell me something,
[07:23] why is Maheen dying to meet you?
[07:26] Why would she meet you every third day,
[07:29] if her mother in law doesn’t like it,
she should sit at her in-laws,
[07:33] when she comes to her mother she should meet you.
[07:35] This is not how you make a home.
[07:37] Mama, she is a human too,
[07:40] she has wishes,
[07:41] the husband doesn’t let her go anywhere,
[07:43] doesn’t take her out, she has a lot of work,
she calls me, I too go.
[07:48] That’s it,
[07:50] sympathise with her as much as
that can be tolerated.
[07:53] If she ruins her home cause of these actions,
[07:57] who will be responsible for it?
[07:59] To hell with the sympathies.
[08:06] Amen.
[08:23] Hello, yes Roshni,
[08:26] what happened?
[08:26] You had told me that you inform
Maheen before you come to meet me.
[08:30] You also told me that you tell her everything
and you don’t hide anything from her.
[08:36] Yes.
[08:36] Then you must also have told her that
I made an excuse to come meet her, to meet you.
[08:41] I don’t know,
[08:44] I might have mentioned it.
[08:45] But I don’t remember, why?
[08:47] Not maybe,
[08:48] what was the need for her to do this conspiracy.
[08:51] What did Maheen do?
[08:53] Maheen, in front of my mother and aunt Zakia said
[08:56] that Roshni hasn’t come to meet me after the wedding,
[09:00] what was the need to say this?
[09:01] I got insulted.
[09:06] No,
[09:07] Roshni must not have said
anything like this on purpose.
[09:12] I am sure there must be a reason.
[09:17] Umar,
[09:19] the whole world can say anything to me
and it doesn’t matter to you.
[09:23] You are just worried that
no one blames Maheen and why is that?
[09:28] Causes she is your wife and
its your duty to take care of her respect.
[09:36] Even though,
she say what she wants when she wants.
[09:40] Roshni.
[09:57] Its useless to talk to you,
[09:59] that is why I am going to my room,
so no one try to talk to me.
[10:02] Yes, you have just one response to everything,
that you are Mansoor’s choice.
[10:07] Aunt, stop it. Have water.
[10:10] Why should I stop?
[10:12] She is ill-mannered and has a bad tongue
[10:13] and she tells me that I came here
because of Mansoor’s wish and liking,
[10:18] that is why no one likes me.
[10:19] Yeah, so what wrong did I say?
[10:22] I have been married for so long
but this sorrow hasn’t left your heart
[10:25] that you couldn’t get Mansoor’s wife by your choice
[10:27] and this is something you keep
on reminding me time to time,
[10:30] at times when I ask for oil and at times
when I just pass from in front of you.
[10:33] Hey, I would have dragged out a stubborn
and ill-mannered daughter in law like you
[10:39] but I always care for my son.
[10:43] Yes, the only thing left for you
to do is drag me out of this house.
[10:45] That is what you cannot do.
[10:47] Sister in law you be quiet.
[10:48] No, let her talk let her talk.
[10:52] You too see and the world can
also hear the wife Mansoor got.
[10:56] Hear me out,
[10:57] I didn’t wish to bring a daughter in law I like,
[11:02] but if Mansoor married you,
[11:04] he should have been careful
and not ruined his life.
[11:08] How did he ruin his life?
What mountain did I break on his head?
[11:12] Don’t make me start,
[11:14] he doesn’t even get food on time,
[11:18] nor washed clothes,
[11:19] you are so short tempered
and someone with a tongue like you,
[11:23] who tolerates such a wife?
[11:24] She is acting like she has borne us a heir.
[11:27] I would have tolerated everything you said
if you had given my Mansoor a child.
[11:33] You are a bitter seed, completely useless.
[11:44] Ill-mannered, stupid girl.
[11:47] Aunt, not having a child is not sister in law’s fault.
[11:51] So it is my fault.
[11:56] She runs her mouth, so it’s her fault.
[12:05] Maheen, she became a liar in front of everyone.
[12:08] Her mother scolded her separately.
[12:10] What was the need to say all this?
[12:14] How was I to know Umar?
[12:18] When mama asked me if she came here or not.
[12:20] I would have said what is the truth.
[12:22] If you have told me,
[12:24] I would have handled it, I really didn’t know.
[12:30] I said the same to Roshni, but she said that…
[12:33] What?
[12:36] She must have felt that I did this on purpose,
[12:40] so that you people cannot meet.
[12:42] No, it’s not like that.
[12:45] Actually, that is it, Maheen.
[12:48] You know she loves me,
she is helpless at the hand of her love.
[12:53] Love is misguiding.
[13:00] Look Maheen,
[13:00] if you ever feel that doubts your intentions,
[13:04] or she says something,
[13:05] then she is scared.
[13:07] Forgive her.
[13:11] She is helpless at the hand of love
[13:14] and then she is a girl,
[13:16] she will think that way.
[13:27] Even I am a woman,
[13:30] I have the same emotions.
[13:33] Do I not have the right to be jealous,
being misled or being scared?
[13:45] What happened?
[13:47] What are you thinking?
[13:49] You don’t meet Roshni for a few days,
[13:52] her mother is really inquisitive and
[13:55] if she finds out the real thing,
[13:58] then Roshni will be in trouble
and you can also land in trouble.
[14:25] Hey…Najia, what are you doing?
[14:27] Najia, what are you doing?
[14:29] They will hear us downstairs.
Like always…
[14:33] Stop crying. No.
[14:36] stop crying,
[14:37] you know mama,
[14:39] how much will you cry?
[14:40] Hey!
[14:42] Your usual excuses have started,
[14:44] that mama is not short tempered,
she gets upset on the outside.
[14:47] Listen to me,
[14:49] this anger on the top, hurts me on the inside.
[14:52] I don’t care about her heart,
my problem is her thinking and her mind.
[14:57] Okay. Okay. Calm down.
[14:59] Hear me out calmly. Here, wait, sit.
[15:03] Save your foot, sit here.
[15:08] Najia,
[15:10] is my love not a bandage on the wounds?
[15:13] Huh?
[15:13] Yeah, she wounds me and you put on bandage.
[15:16] This will not work.
[15:18] What do I do, Najia?
[15:20] Should I fight with her?
[15:22] No, I have no such hope,
[15:24] and I don’t think you have
the courage to take a stand for me.
[15:28] Najia, its not about courage.
[15:32] I can go question her,
[15:33] take a stand for you
[15:36] but you don’t get it.
[15:37] What do you think that
[15:39] she will feel embarrassed and say sorry to you?
[15:41] No, its not true.
[15:45] Instead, she will have more
bitterness towards you in her heart,
[15:47] she will feel you have instigated me against her.
[15:51] I know my mother better than you.
[15:53] I don’t understand her problem.
[15:55] Have we been married for 8-10 years,
that the issue has got out of hand?
[15:58] We have gone to a lot of doctors,
no one know what is wrong.
[16:01] When all of them say everything is normal,
then what do I do?
[16:04] Why does she always curse me
for not bearing a child?
[16:07] Slowly. Okay, okay, stop.
[16:12] I got such an expensive pot for you as a gift,
you broke it in your anger.
[16:34] Umar, come here son.
[16:37] Hello grandma.
[16:39] Hello son,
[16:41] come home early for a change some day,
[16:43] you come so late we don’t get to meet.
[16:46] I go to sleep.
[16:47] There you go, when I didn’t used to work,
everyone had complains,
[16:52] now that I am going, still you have complains.
[16:54] There is a bride at home,
[16:56] fall in love with her,
then you will come early.
[17:00] Fareed was saying you guys go out for 2-4 days.
[17:04] Look at this bride, she has started handling
the home as soon as she has come.
[17:08] She can handle the kitchen all her life,
now is the time, go out.
[17:15] Maheen likes staying home.
[17:17] I know what she likes,
[17:20] I will take her to the zoo.
[17:21] Oh God,
[17:23] the zoo is something you like as a child.
[17:25] Now take her out,
[17:26] take her to Murree or Swat, travel with her.
[17:31] What is there in Murree, Swat?
[17:32] People have littered so much.
[17:34] Maheen get unwell with traveling.
[17:37] I will take her to aunt’s home on the weekend,
I know she will get happy.
[17:44] Okay, I am going, I am getting late.
[17:45] Bye.
Yes, go. Go.
[17:47] This child...
[17:55] I have told you that
I am not coming to the roof to meet you.
[17:59] Roshni, what is wrong with you?
[18:01] The other day you had asked me
to come to the roof to meet you,
[18:04] today I am asking you
and you are being stubborn.
[18:06] Please, I am saying this for you.
[18:09] I think your mother stops you from going out,
[18:11] I am saying it cause of that.
[18:13] I am scared that Maheen will get us caught.
[18:16] I don’t trust Maheen at all.
[18:19] What are you saying, man?
Why would Maheen do this to us?
[18:22] In fact, she suggested this,
she cares for us,
[18:25] she told us not to meet outside,
so that we don’t get caught.
[18:29] Or get in trouble.
[18:30] Oh, she showed her true color's,
she told you about herself.
[18:35] She is doing all this so that
we cannot meet each other.
[18:39] Roshni, please.
[18:41] You are misunderstanding Maheen for no reason.
[18:43] Yes, yes,
[18:44] if she is this sincere and really cares for us,
[18:47] then go and do one thing,
[18:49] say what I tell you,
[18:50] then I will see if she is like you think
or if she is what I think.
[18:57] Roshni.
[19:00] Umar, I am going, mama is calling.
[19:01] Bye.
[19:17] Who is it?
[19:35] How are you feeling?
[19:39] My fever has gone down,
[19:40] I just have a headache.
[19:43] Should I make you lunch?
[19:47] No, you got tea in the morning,
[19:49] you must have gotten insulted on that.
[19:51] Not at all, nothing like that.
[19:54] Aunt herself told me…
[19:58] Leave it.
[20:01] I have been living with her for a long time,
[20:04] I know her, don’t try to pacify me.
[20:08] Sister in law, she was angry at that time.
[20:11] I hear all this from Mansoor often,
[20:16] that she gets angry a lot,
[20:19] she has nothing in her heart.
[20:22] The day what is in her heart comes to her tongue,
[20:25] I will believe you.
[20:29] Okay you tell me,
[20:31] should I make you soup or rice?
[20:33] No, no need,
[20:35] I am fine.
[20:37] I will get up and make it myself
[20:39] or else I will get insulted that her son comes tired
and he doesn’t get food.
[20:45] This help of yours will be an issue for you,
you too go, or else she will take her anger on you.
[20:54] She was saying with a lot of love,
that if you are going upstairs talk to her.
[20:59] All the love is for you,
[21:03] you gather her blessings,
[21:06] her good words,
[21:08] everyone doesn’t have a fate like you.
[21:13] Right now she is getting her beloved
daughter in law do all the work,
[21:17] she will prove that she is good,
[21:19] she wants her to impress everyone.
[21:50] This is my daughter, Roshni.
[21:53] Roshni, say hello.
[21:55] Hello.
[21:56] Hello.
[21:57] God bless. God bless.
[22:00] Child, leave tea, come sit with me.
[22:03] Come.
[22:12] Your daughter is really pretty by the grace of God.
[22:16] Child, what do you do?
[22:22] She is silent, she doesn’t talk much.
[22:26] She does work at home.
[22:30] She doesn’t talk much,
[22:31] that is good
[22:33] or else you know girls of today,
[22:36] they have 1 feet long tongues and
they don’t want to make a home.
[22:43] Whatever it is, we really like your daughter,
[22:47] and both of them are a good match too.
[22:49] We are waiting for you to say yes.
[22:59] She became shy.
You know she is the type to stay home.
[23:19] Listen, Maheen,
[23:21] come here.
[23:27] Yeah?
[23:30] The weather is good, let’s take some fresh air.
[23:34] I feel cold.
[23:36] Cold? In this weather?
[23:38] Man, you even feel cold in hot weather.
[23:41] God knows what will happen to you in winters.
[23:43] You know when we used to go to
grandpa’s home for our winter vacations,
[23:46] all of us would get inside one quilt
[23:48] and then you would hear someone call out,
[23:50] hot eggs, hot eggs,
[23:54] Yes...
[23:55] and you would make me get out of
that warm quilt to get you eggs to eat.
[24:00] You were really cunning as a child,
you knew how to get your work done.
[24:04] Not at all,
[24:06] for that one boiled egg,
[24:08] I used to do all your work,
[24:10] day and night. Do you remember?
[24:13] You want it?
[24:14] No.
[24:17] Listen, tomorrow is Saturday, I was thinking
[24:21] we would go somewhere, lets plan something.
[24:22] Huh?
[24:27] Umar, I won’t stay overnight at mom’s.
[24:30] Not mama’s home, something else.
[24:36] Lets watch a movie.
[24:39] Ask aunt.
[24:40] Yes, that’s my job, I will do it.
[24:45] Yeah…
[24:47] Should we take Roshni along?
[25:01] I thought you people have not met for a few days.
[25:05] Even you two haven’t. met for a few days…
[25:10] Yes,
[25:11] you said we had to be careful.
[25:16] With me being there,
[25:19] no one will doubt us and
[25:21] Roshni’s word will be proven true
that she came to meet me.
[25:25] No. No.
[25:30] Yeah, maybe.
[25:36] I am feeling cold.
[25:42] Don’t start the heater in the room.
[25:47] Roshni was doubting Maheen for no reason,
[25:51] now at least she will be at peace that
Maheen doesn’t want anything bad for us.
[27:03] Mama, I am telling you right now,
[27:05] I will not marry that Metric fail,
general store owner.
[27:09] So what do we do?
[27:11] Will a prince come for you from the sky?
[27:14] The boy’s family and the boy both are good
[27:17] and he also has his own car,
[27:19] what more do you want?
[27:20] Hey may have a lot but
he doesn’t have what I want.
[27:26] That’s it,
[27:27] I have had enough of your dramas.
[27:28] I won’t listen to you.
[27:30] I have given them my word.
[27:32] Mama, I don’t get what is the haste,
[27:34] investigate at least.
[27:36] If I am such a burden,
[27:38] drag me out of the house.
[27:40] This nonsense will no longer work,
[27:43] you have extended your
wedding discussion as you wanted,
[27:47] now I will not hear you out.
[27:49] Do you hear me?
[27:50] I am your mother,
[27:51] whatever I do, will be for your benefit.
[27:55] I don’t know what the problem is?
[27:58] I will have to do everything myself.
[28:03] Roshni.
[28:09] You have flu and then you go to the roof at night.
[28:13] This is not the weather to go
to roam around under the open sky?
[28:18] Ask Umar, he got our daughter ill.
[28:21] Its not a flu,
[28:23] I got a cold.
[28:25] Child, what else is a flu, then?
[28:27] Umar, come on son,
quickly go and get herbal tea.
[28:31] In fact, I would say take her to the doctor,
before you go to work.
[28:38] The cold of the end of the winter season
is really bad, it gets into your bones.
[28:42] Yes.
[28:43] She too roams around in a single shawl,
she doesn’t wear sweater or socks.
[28:48] She will get a cold.
[28:49] Yes, it’s the fashion of today that makes girls ill.
[28:55] Grandma, the shawl was warm.
[28:57] Child, one shawl would do nothing,
wear a cap. A cap.
[29:01] Cap?
[29:01] Yes.
[29:11] Here you go, Maheen.
[29:13] Herbal tea.
[29:16] I got the medication now, have it.
[29:19] I am having herbal tea, I will be fine.
[29:26] You need anything else?
[29:29] Will you fine till the evening?
[29:35] We have a movie plan, that’s why.
[29:39] If you are not well,
we will go some other day. It’s fine.
[29:41] I will be ready.
[29:44] I told papa, I will leave early from work.
[29:49] fine.
[29:50] if you need something, let me know.
[29:51] Umar,
[29:56] when you get movie tickets,
[29:58] just get two.
[30:00] I will shop till then.
[30:02] Okay.
[30:35] What happened Najia?
Do you have fever again?
[30:38] Am I am kid that I will cry on having fever?
[30:42] Then?
[30:44] Did mama say something?
[30:46] Yes.
[30:49] What did she say now?
[30:57] Have soup, have herbal tea,
[30:59] take your medication,
[31:00] should I boil eggs for you,
[31:02] why didn’t you wear sweater?
[31:05] Is this what she said?
[31:07] What is there to cry in this?
[31:11] Oh, so these are tears of happiness.
[31:15] This is what I am crying about that
she said all this to Maheen and not me.
[31:19] Like she is the one who falls ill
and I am nothing.
[31:23] Man, why do you go downstairs?
[31:26] Yes,
[31:27] imprison me in these two rooms,
[31:28] I don’t like going downstairs with
my damned face and increasing her BP.
[31:33] If I don’t go, then she questions,
[31:35] she doesn’t meet, she doesn’t say hello.
[31:37] If I go, then seeing me,
[31:40] she shows love to Maheen.
[31:42] I ask, have I never fallen ill?
She has never showered love like this to me.
[31:48] Okay, you come sit here.
[31:50] Come. Come, please.
[31:56] Okay,
[31:57] I asked you, right?
[31:59] I took an off from the office cause of you.
[32:04] Okay, tell me, should I take you shopping.
[32:06] No.
[32:10] Can I take you to your mother’s?
[32:12] Not at all.
[32:13] If I go there, she will see me
and realize I am not happy,
[32:16] and then her sarcasm,
see the result of a love marriage.
[32:25] Okay, let’s go out somewhere.
[32:29] Yes, I will take you for a movie.
[32:41] Roshni.
[32:43] Hey, Roshni.
[32:46] Where did you go?
[32:48] Roshni.
[32:53] Roshni.
[33:07] Where are you going?
[33:08] I am going to watch a movie with Maheen.
[33:13] What happened?
[33:14] You have doubts again?
[33:18] Come with me,
[33:19] see for yourself that Maheen is with me.
[33:22] I am not doubting it.
[33:24] If her in-laws are so strict,
[33:26] then why is she doing this
and giving them a reason?
[33:28] They will say that the friend comes
and takes her to watch a movie,
[33:33] that too hiding from the in-laws and husband.
[33:38] We are not going secretly,
the husband will be with us.
[33:43] Oh God,
[33:44] when the husband will be there,
then why are you going?
[33:46] What do you have to do between them?
[33:50] Mama, her husband is also stubborn and egoistic,
[33:56] he doesn’t talk properly to her.
[33:57] So poor Maheen asks me to come along,
she will also enjoy it.
[34:01] After all, her husband will go somewhere
else after the wedding, Maheen has to shop too.
[34:07] Roshni,
[34:08] whether he is stubborn or egoistic,
[34:10] he is her husband,
[34:11] she should compromise with the situation,
[34:14] I don’t understand
why Maheen is dragging you in between.
[34:18] If he minds, then?
[34:28] Objection, one after the other.
[34:31] The deal is that you doubt me,
[34:34] that I take Maheen’s name
and go somewhere else.
[34:37] Now the husband and
wife will pick me and drop me back,
[34:42] will you be satisfied then?
[34:44] If I tell you the right thing, you argue with me.
[34:48] Neither you or Maheen have a brain,
[34:50] after all, girls of today,
[34:52] they have no brains, nor they listen.
[34:55] Do what you want.
[34:57] Hear one thing out clearly,
[34:59] I will also pray a lot for your wedding.
[35:02] I hope you get married soon,
[35:04] so that I am at peace.
[35:06] Move now.
[35:07] Amen.
[35:10] Bye.
[35:27] Maheen,
[35:29] why are you not ready yet?
[35:31] You said you would come by 5, it’s just 3:30.
[35:35] Well you don’t have to dress up that much.
[35:37] Give this to me. Come on, give it.
[35:39] I thought we have to pick Roshni
[35:42] and if we are going
we will say hello to aunt Zakia, okay?
[35:45] Here, done.
[35:46] Come on.
[35:51] Thank you.
[35:53] You are being sarcastic?
[35:56] I am thinking you.
[35:58] Okay, go, hurry up.
[36:15] Oh, who is calling?
[36:23] Hello.
[36:25] Yes, hello, how are you sister?
[36:28] Yes, yes.
[36:30] What?
[36:33] No, nothing like that, I feel that…
[36:37] listen to me.
[36:40] Hey sister, I think there is some confusion.
[36:44] Hello?
[36:52] I don’t understand,
where all will this girl get me insulted.
