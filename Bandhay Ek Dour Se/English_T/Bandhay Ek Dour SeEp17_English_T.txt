[00:29] Should I take tea for uncle.
[00:32] I just gave it to him.
[00:34] You should have told me,
I would have taken it.
[00:37] When I went to the neighbors,
was mama saying something.
[00:41] No,
[00:43] she was asking where you went,
[00:45] I told her.
[00:46] I am sure she created a scene and also that
I gave you all the work in the kitchen.
[00:54] No, not at all.
[00:57] Did you tell mama,
you washed clothes in the morning?
[01:02] What is wrong in that aunt?
[01:04] You have a washing machine,
[01:06] at mama’s I used to wash clothes with my hands.
[01:10] Here you have a machine,
a maid and you do the rest of the work,
[01:14] grandma knows all this.
[01:16] Don’t cover up, I know mama well,
[01:20] she must try to pollute your mind
by saying that I am not your aunt,
[01:24] but your mother in law and that too
a hitler mother in law.
[01:28] Not at all.
[01:31] You know when you are not around,
[01:35] grandma tells not to consider you
as my mother in law,
[01:38] nor aunt,
[01:40] consider you my mother and take care of you.
[01:44] She tells me that you took care of her all your life
and I have to take care of you like that.
[01:49] Okay,
[01:51] you go to your room,
[01:53] when Umar comes from work, give him time.
[01:56] Come on.
[02:20] Will you have tea?
[02:21] No.
[02:27] Are you hungry?
[02:29] No, man.
[02:32] Should I put on the TV?
[02:34] What is wrong Maheen,
[02:36] if I want to watch TV, I will put it on.
[02:38] Sorry,
[02:40] grandma told me to spend time with you.
[02:44] Okay come here, sit. Come on sit here.
[02:50] Did you talk to Roshni, I mean today.
[02:55] No.
[02:59] You call her please.
[03:01] Me? Why?
[03:03] just ask her if she is ok,
is there an issue with her.
[03:09] So you call him.
[03:12] Man, I tried, she didn’t answer,
she is not replying to my messages.
[03:15] That has never happened.
I want to ask if all is ok.
[03:19] Do it man.
[03:21] How do I call her Umar,
what do I say to her?
[03:25] Man, call her, she is your friend,
you can call her when you want.
[03:31] She is not my friend anymore.
[03:33] Where is your phone.
[03:37] She is not my friend.
[03:41] Call her, you call her.
[03:44] Call her. She is really sensitive.
[03:46] I don’t know what she minded,
I am worried for her,
[03:50] I don’t know man,
[03:52] what is the issue, why is she not picking up?
[03:56] Did her mother find out about us?
[03:58] If she did she will treat her badly.
[04:03] Try it please.
[04:12] Umar was lost and worried today.
[04:17] Yes, he had a long face when he came home
and he went to this room immediately.
[04:22] Oh, okay,
[04:26] that is why all day long,
[04:29] he had his phone in his hand,
[04:31] some times message,
some times call, new marriage.
[04:36] Now you don’t get after her that
he went to the room as soon as he came home.
[04:40] I am no Hitler,
[04:43] I told Maheen to go to her husband,
sit with him, talk to him, give him time.
[04:50] You did good.
[04:52] Obviously the wedding happened suddenly,
[04:54] it takes time to transition from
the old relation to the new one
[04:59] and we need to help them to understand each other,
[05:04] that’s how love increases between husband and wife.
[05:07] What do you say?
[05:09] Our elders used to say this.
[05:12] Yes you don’t know anything.
[06:07] What happened Maheen?
[06:08] She didn’t answer.
[06:11] Call on her home number,
[06:14] her mother might pick up
but we will know if she is fine.
[06:18] You will argue with me
why I said this and why I said that,
[06:22] I cannot make stories,
I cannot lie, don’t make me do this.
[06:28] What big task did I tell you to do,
[06:30] I just asked you to call,
[06:31] we will know she is fine,
my heart will be at peace,
[06:35] its not such a big task,
can’t you do this much for me?
[06:49] You are like the moon of Eid.
[06:52] What is this that you take Roshni
from outside and leave from outside.
[06:57] Think that I come inside,
say hello to aunt.
[07:02] Yes.
[07:06] Yes.
[07:10] Yes, I will give it to her.
[07:11] Yes mama?
[07:12] Maheen is on the phone.
[07:18] I will talk, I will give you your phone.
[07:28] Hello.
[07:32] I am fine.
[07:33] What will happen to me?
[07:36] Yes, I am not talking to him,
[07:38] I don’t want you to curse me.
[07:40] You must curse me.
[07:43] Tell him to be patient, forget me,
your home will get ruined and I will get blamed.
[07:50] Maheen, give me the phone.
[07:58] Hello.
[08:00] Roshni, where were you lost?
[08:04] What is this?
[08:07] Don’t be superstitious for no reason.
[08:10] Maheen has no problem, no issue,
[08:15] take this guilt out of your heart.
[08:18] Please don’t disappear like this,
I become restless.
[08:21] You know well I can not love without you.
[08:25] If I don’t hear your voice,
I am not at peace.
[08:29] But you two didn’t do right with me.
[09:27] Come on.
[09:29] Don’t do this Umar.
[09:31] The maid is on leaves,
[09:32] aunt will feel I am running away from work,
so I am going to my mother’s home.
[09:36] If we had to go, you should have told me earlier,
[09:39] I would have sorted some work in the morning.
[09:41] You are worried about making
an image and impression.
[09:45] You are in a hurry to meet Roshni.
[09:47] I won’t meet her,
[09:49] I will drop you and go to work.
[09:51] Then why are you taking me?
I don’t want to go right now.
[09:55] You meet Roshni, you talk to her.
[10:00] Why?
[10:01] What do I talk to her about?
[10:05] She sat in front in the car,
[10:11] so she feels she hurt you,
[10:14] did bad,
[10:16] so she is worried and has a weird mood,
you talk to her.
[10:20] Remove her guilt.
[10:22] Whatever she is feeling you
understand it better than me,
[10:26] so she needs you, not me.
[10:28] You go and me get and convince her,
[10:33] console her that you are only her’s,
[10:35] and I have not stopped you
from saying this, go say it.
[10:41] You feel you are good and
the two of us are bad?
[10:45] You are worried and
the two of us are happy,
[10:48] we are celebrating. Is this what you think?
[10:57] What do I have to say?
[11:01] Come in the car, I will tell you.
[11:15] Razia,
[11:18] I will tell Umar to ask you before making a plan.
[11:22] You didn’t like it, right?
[11:26] No, nothing like that,
[11:28] I just didn’t like the fear
and worry on Maheen’s face.
[11:34] fear and worry?
[11:37] Obviously,
[11:38] had she asked me would I have said no?
[11:43] She is scared like I will eat her.
[11:46] She makes Umar say it,
[11:50] like she is going because
he asked her to go.
[11:53] This gun of wishes is fired
from a husband’s shoulder.
[11:58] You have till always gotten me
to agree to everything like this.
[12:02] That is why!
[12:06] You know well Fareed,
[12:08] I used to do it cause of mama’s nature.
[12:13] Does Maheen fear the same from me
that I had from mama?
[12:20] Am I a similar mother in law like mama?
[12:27] What stupid worries are you thinking about?
[12:30] Instead of asking this question,
[12:33] why don’t you remove this
fear through your actions,
[12:36] if you understand the problem.
[12:39] What is wrong?
[12:43] Wow, wife of mine, wow.
[12:50] You don’t need to think this, Roshni.
[12:55] I don’t feel that you are coming
between me and Umar,
[13:00] the truth is I am coming
between you and Umar.
[13:08] You don’t consider yourself a sinner,
[13:13] you did nothing wrong.
[13:16] Wrong was done with l 3 of us,
[13:21] fate made fun of us.
[13:29] You have memorised it well,
[13:33] but Maheen,
[13:36] tell me what is in your heart,
[13:39] not what Umar taught you.
[13:44] I am saying it with my heart.
[13:51] Roshni,
[13:54] you please stop taking me wrong.
[14:02] I have never wanted bad for you and Umar,
[14:10] you two are my friends.
[14:13] Not are, we were because one
of your friend is your husband
[14:21] and the other your husband’s second wife.
[14:27] What happened?
[14:28] You didn’t like it?
[14:31] You feel hurt?
[14:33] Maheen, I should be the one who should be hurt.
[14:37] You must call me this word similar to a swear.
[14:44] No,
[14:46] nothing like that.
[14:49] If it was true, why would I come here?
[14:51] You didn’t come here for me,
[14:55] you came for Umar.
[14:58] You want to tell him,
make him feel you have a big heart.
[15:04] You are his well wisher
[15:08] but if you had really understood our friendship,
[15:12] respected our love,
[15:16] and didn’t want to come between us,
[15:21] then you would have said no to this wedding.
[15:30] Then maybe,
[15:32] maybe me and Umar would have
believed your friendship and me?
[15:38] Maheen, I would have washed your feet
and consumed the water.
[15:43] But at that moment,
selfishness took over friendship.
[15:49] Not selfishness Roshni,
[15:53] helplessness
[15:58] and friendship.
[16:01] That was selfishness.
[16:08] The first groom left your home,
[16:11] you luckily got the second proposal at home.
[16:15] Had you said no,
[16:18] you would have been a
burden on your widow mother.
[16:23] And if I agree that you were helpless,
[16:28] then me and Umar too were helpless.
[16:32] Helpless at the hand of love,
[16:36] helpless at the hand of our hearts.
[16:39] I know,
[16:43] and I can understand.
[16:45] But you don’t believe it,
[16:47] you don’t do anything about it.
[16:54] What do I do?
[16:56] What do I have in my hands?
[16:59] What did I have in my hands back then?
[17:01] What could I do?
[17:03] The religious scholar was there,
[17:05] mama, uncle, grandma,
[17:09] the locality,
[17:11] should I have said no at this time?
[17:15] Please,
[17:17] keep yourself in my place and tell me,
[17:22] what would you do?
[17:27] I can do it,
[17:30] I would have said no.
[17:35] I can say no everyone for Umar,
[17:40] but when my mother asks about the reason,
I cannot take Umar’s name.
[17:47] Because you have added his
name in front of yours before me.
[18:31] Thank you very much for coming.
[18:35] Aunt. Bye. I am going.
[18:37] Maheen, where are you going?
Have food and go.
[18:41] No aunt,
[18:42] I am getting late,
I have to sit with mama too.
[18:44] No,
[18:45] you sit,
[18:46] I want to talk to you,
[18:49] come sit.
[18:56] Roshni was telling me about you and your husband.
[19:06] What is the matter?
[19:07] Do you not have a place in his heart?
[19:10] Look, it will take some time for that,
[19:14] after all, you know the situation in
which the wedding happened.
[19:17] It is possible that this wedding was against his wish.
[19:24] Maheen,
[19:26] whatever I am telling you, it’s like mother
[19:30] cause you are like my Roshni.
[19:34] Look a woman needs to make a home,
[19:38] you do what he likes and
don’t do what he doesn’t like.
[19:51] Yes.
[19:54] If he is a little stiff, no problem.
[19:57] Just pray he gets fine.
[20:04] Yes aunt,
[20:07] the things you found out,
[20:10] don’t mention them to mama.
[20:13] No, what are you saying?
[20:16] I was just a little sad for you,
[20:21] so I talked to you about all this.
[20:26] Bye.
[20:32] Maheen,
[20:35] if she got married under pressure,
then he will try to break the rope.
[20:44] Because those who get married once
[20:51] because of their parents’ pressure
they surely get married again
[20:57] and at that time their parents
don’t say anything they say
[21:02] that we have done what we wanted,
[21:07] now let him do what he wants.
[21:14] You take care,
[21:17] Maheen.
[22:00] I can say no everyone for Umar,
[22:05] but when my mother asks about the reason,
I cannot take Umar’s name.
[22:12] Because you have added his
name in front of yours before me.
[22:20] Those who get married once
[22:25] because of their parents’ pressure
they surely get married again
[22:30] and at that time their parents
don’t say anything they say
[22:35] that we have done what we wanted,
[22:41] now let him do what he wants.
[22:55] Maheen, look what I found.
[22:59] Look.
[23:01] I was cleaning the roof,
[23:04] so I found this. Come see.
[23:07] You remember this?
[23:11] I don’t know what class exams…
[23:13] you were young you came to our home on holidays,
[23:17] you got all your dolls with you,
[23:20] Umar and Mansoor really made fun of you
that you are so old but still play with dolls.
[23:25] You got upset and I think you threw it on the roof.
[23:29] Now I have cleaned the roof I found it.
[23:32] Keep it safe,
[23:34] your kids will play.
[23:37] Clean it.
[24:21] This is the doll house from your childhood.
[24:28] You still have a hobby of playing with a doll house.
[24:32] A home is not a hobby.
[24:39] It’s in a bad state,
[24:41] decorate it a little, keep a doll in it.
[24:46] No matter how much you
decorate something empty,
[24:49] no matter how much you clean it,
[24:53] it stays empty.
[24:57] You are talking philosophy,
[24:59] you are really serious, wow.
[25:02] Is all okay?
[25:08] Okay, tell me,
[25:14] did you talk to Roshni?
[25:17] Did she understand?
[25:22] I don’t know,
[25:25] but I understand.
[25:29] Now I have to make you understand.
[25:33] What?
[25:36] You get married to Roshni, Umar.
[25:56] Live long,
[25:57] I was about to get up for water.
[26:00] You are still awake.
[26:03] Yes, I am not sleepy.
[26:06] You look worried.
[26:07] Is there an issue.
[26:09] No, there is none,
[26:11] I pray to God, there is none.
[26:14] I just have a doubt in my heart.
[26:16] All ok?
[26:17] What doubt do you have now?
[26:21] Maheen doesn’t seem happy to me, Monis.
[26:25] The freshness a woman has in
the first few days of her wedding,
[26:28] I don’t see that on her face at all.
[26:32] A sad smile, a depressed face,
she doesn’t even talk to me about it.
[26:37] Mama, you know Maheen doesn’t like complaining.
[26:43] My sister is really patient.
[26:46] Yes, but daughters say
what is in their heart to their mother,
[26:49] it reduces the burden on their heart.
[26:51] Mama, she doesn’t want to worry you and
I am sure there is nothing worrisome,
[26:57] I mean,
[26:58] who can have a problem with Maheen?
[27:04] Even if the daughter in law is made of gold,
[27:06] people have issues with her and
then Razia’s temperament,
[27:09] she has always had issues with me,
[27:12] what if she is taking revenge from
Maheen considering her my daughter.
[27:16] Mama, there is nothing like that,
[27:18] aunt is not like that.
[27:20] The weather gets warm or cold in each home,
[27:24] but these doubts you have,
there is nothing like that.
[27:28] Okay?
[27:30] Uncle is there, grandma is there,
[27:32] they all love Maheen.
[27:34] On top of that, Umar,
[27:37] our Umar,
[27:38] he will ensure that Maheen is not hurt.
[27:43] Yes, thinking of Umar my heart is relaxed.
[27:48] Its cause of Umar, I don’t worry.
[27:51] No matter how everyone else is
I am sure Umar keeps her like a flower.
[28:00] Okay, I am going you sleep.
[28:13] You have any idea what you are saying?
[28:17] I am asking you to marry Roshni,
[28:20] isnt this what you want.
[28:22] I wanted this,
[28:26] but it’s not possible now.
[28:28] Why?
[28:30] People get married for the second time,
[28:33] you can too.
[28:36] Do it.
[28:42] The person whose first wedding is not by his will,
can he get married again,
[28:45] that too my their liking?
[28:50] Nothing is hidden from you Maheen,
[28:54] you know it all, about the home, me,
[28:58] the environment of the home.
[29:00] You know it all.
[29:03] Brother Mabsoor is elder than me,
[29:05] still he cannot leave the home
without mama and papa’s permission,
[29:10] I can’t even think of marrying again.
[29:13] What we are talking about here,
[29:16] this discussion is useless,
[29:18] there is point of this.
[29:19] Umar,
[29:22] you just keep the situation in front of you
and decide what you need to do.
[29:29] If you cannot face the situation,
[29:32] fight it,
[29:35] then give up,
[29:36] step back.
[29:40] Stop meeting Roshni
[29:45] and if this is not possible for you,
[29:50] then fight,
[29:52] do what I am telling you.
[29:56] How long will this go on for?
[30:39] Shahista,
[30:40] I have seen a lot of shameless people,
[30:42] but none like you.
[30:45] I mean, you are still saying that
I didn’t come to your son’s wedding.
[30:50] My foot.
[30:53] You people have any shame?
[30:55] First you gave my Roshni hopes for marriage,
[30:59] then your son was being nice to my daughter,
[31:03] then you people took her to your home,
[31:05] be quiet and listen to me.
[31:07] You took her there s PK that
she can see the environment of your home.
[31:11] Look madam, I didn’t like it then,
but still you did it.
[31:16] Hey, you should have properly,
formally got a proposal, but no.
[31:22] Yes, something must have happened,
[31:25] so my Roshni came running from there,
[31:28] she must have seen your son’s actions.
[31:30] Stop it.
[31:33] You should have talked to me
about my daughter’s proposal,
[31:37] instead you are giving me
the card for your son’s wedding.
[31:41] To hell with you.
[32:29] I will go but whenever I go to aunt’s
I come back with a heavy heart.
[32:37] There is no one to care for her in her illness.
[32:41] She has become really alone after uncle.
[32:45] Yes,
[32:46] and then God didn’t give her a child even.
[32:50] Oh God. My poor sister,
[32:53] all her life she lived a tough life.
[32:57] She got insulted for not having
a child from her in laws and then
[33:02] the husband often threatened her
of second marriage
[33:08] and now she is lonely.
[33:13] What happened?
[33:15] Nothing,
[33:17] just thought of sister in law.
[33:20] Poor thing.
[33:22] At least brother Mansoor is good,
[33:26] he doesn’t curse her or give her threats
of divorcing her or a second marriage.
[33:33] That’s it, it’s fine.
[33:36] No,
[33:38] aunt I didn’t mean that.
[33:41] Aunt it’s my habit,
[33:43] I say things without thinking.
[33:46] Please don’t mind, I didn’t mean that.
[33:50] The massage is done.
[33:53] No…
[33:55] aunt I wasn’t even thinking this.
[34:00] Mad.
[34:03] Mama is right, I am dumb.
[34:06] I don’t know how long she will stay upset for.
[34:19] What did you say to Maheen
that she is ready to do all this.
[34:24] I didn’t say anything,
[34:26] she was saying big dialogues.
[34:28] I am generous,
[34:30] I am a sacrificial Godess,
[34:33] she even said that you can keep Umar,
[34:36] it doesn’t matter to her.
[34:39] She said that?
[34:40] Wl yes, so?
[34:42] When a married woman tells another woman
that she has no relation with her husband,
[34:48] what does that mean?
[34:50] It means one thing.
[34:51] That is what I am trying to tell you Roshni,
[34:55] both of us have no such feelings between us,
[34:58] that married couples have.
[35:00] What girl would say that?
[35:01] See, she is telling me that I accept you,
[35:04] marry you.
[35:06] Not just marriage,
[35:08] she is giving you two options.
[35:11] Either marry me, or leave me.
[35:15] She knows well that
you won’t go for the first option,
[35:19] so what is the second option?
[35:21] To leave me.
[35:24] Its not like that Roshni,
she must have said this with full sincerity.
[35:29] Then why don’t you do one thing,
[35:31] worship her sincerity.
[35:34] Cause you don’t care or need my love.
[35:38] You are happy with generosity.
[35:43] No Roshni, what can be a bigger need than love.
[35:47] You don’t compare yourself to
Maheen again and again,
[35:51] it hurts.
[35:53] It hurts me too,
[35:55] because I am far behind in conception with her.
[35:59] Tell me, will you marry me?
[36:02] No right?
[36:03] Then accept her second condition and leave me?
[36:06] She didn’t put a condition, she gave a suggestion,
[36:08] I have the right to decide.
[36:11] I will decide on my own.
[36:14] Roshni, I will marry you,
[36:17] I will talk to my family.
[36:20] But not right now,
[36:23] after a while.
[36:24] Okay, and after that?
[36:28] What after that?
[36:29] will your family agree?
[36:32] Maheen is your uncle’s daughter,
[36:35] the whole family will turn against you.
[36:38] What will you do? Leave home?
[36:42] Okay,
[36:44] for a second, let’s believe you leave home,
[36:48] but after that?
[36:49] where will you take me?
[36:51] You don’t have a job,
[36:54] you handle your father’s business
[36:57] and he will not give the whole business to
you out of this happiness and my mother,
[37:01] why would she marry me to you?
[37:04] A man who is already married,
[37:06] and doesn’t even have a job?
[37:09] What do I do, Roshni?
[37:11] Right now I cannot suddenly convince them,
[37:15] I can only talk.
[37:16] Yes, you will talk and then forget for sure.
[37:19] Look,
[37:22] it will be fin,
[37:24] when your family ends your wedding with Maheen
[37:27] and accept that they made a mistake
[37:30] and they themselves say that Umar,
[37:33] marry where you want to.
[37:36] It will work then.
[37:39] Roshni, what cannot happen,
[37:41] Maheen wants that,
you are saying the same thing.
[37:47] A lot can happen if your goddess
of sacrifice is really willing to sacrifice.
