[01:18] Mama.
[01:19] What are you doing, aunt?
[01:20] Mama.
Leave me. I will not leave her.
[01:22] Mama…
[01:50] Tell me, what happened?
[01:53] Don’t ask me anything, Monis.
[01:56] You went to Roshni’s home, right?
[01:59] Tell me what did you talk about there?
[02:02] You always had a complaint that I wanted to get
rid of my daughter from my head as a burden.
[02:10] I still want to see her in her home.
[02:16] A daughter is not a burden,
[02:20] the burden is the thinking
that the society shows us.
[02:23] Still, tell me, what did they say?
[02:27] Just let me be quiet.
[02:48] I had never thought that
[02:53] I would talk about this to
my daughter and daughter in law.
[03:01] You can talk about everything
with your daughter,
[03:04] go ahead.
[03:08] Maheen only two people are
standing with Umar at this moment,
[03:11] one is me and the other is you.
[03:17] I maybe am supporting him because
whatever he is saying and doing,
[03:21] I am responsible for it,
[03:25] and also because I am scared
that he will become a rebel.
[03:29] But
[03:32] I don’t know why are you supporting him?
[03:39] But child,
[03:40] I feel hesitant in supporting him.
[03:46] I..I don’t.
[03:51] I don’t want to mistreat you, Maheen.
[03:58] Tell me uncle,
[04:01] what do you want?
[04:03] What is your decision?
[04:09] Heart.
[04:14] My heart says that in every
decision you will be mistreated,
[04:22] living with Umar and
[04:25] not living with Umar too.
[04:29] So,
[04:34] I give you the right to decide.
[04:37] What do you want uncle?
[04:40] A daughter’s decision easily
becomes a father’s wish.
[04:48] Child, I want that you always live with us,
[04:53] even if not as a daughter in law,
but as a daughter.
[04:58] Don’t consider this my selfishness,
[05:04] that I want your support in old age.
[05:10] I don’t want to give Zakia
another shock, Maheen.
[05:24] So,
[05:28] so, then,
[05:31] then we will decide for Umar.
[05:35] I mean, is me living here your condition?
[05:43] I am not in a position to put
conditions in front of my son.
[05:55] I have hopes from my daughter,
[05:58] I can talk to her,
[05:59] so I am not putting a condition,
I am requesting her.
[06:04] Uncle, order.
[06:06] Order me.
[06:08] I don’t want to tie you down, child.
[06:14] Look,
[06:16] if you feel that your life will be wasted,
[06:22] then you have a right
to speak up about it.
[06:27] But don’t make any decision hastily,
Zakia, already…
[06:38] Uncle.
[06:40] Uncle,
[06:43] I will live here.
[06:45] I will live here with you,
[06:48] till you want
[06:52] You got me here,
[06:56] when you think its feasible,
[06:58] you can drop me back.
[07:02] Just don’t mention this to Umar.
[07:07] Now if you are satisfied from my side,
[07:15] then satisfy Umar as well.
[07:23] Live long.
[07:25] Live happy.
[08:10] If it was just about Umar,
[08:12] we would have beaten him 
and made him understand.
[08:15] But we are upset at her, 
she is supporting Umar.
[08:19] She has almost convinced her father in law.
[08:22] Zakia, make your daughter understand,
[08:25] control her,
[08:26] I fear that she will leave alone
 with her husband as the groom.
[08:30] The fun people had 
to poke fun at us is done,
[08:32] people had to curse us, they did.
[08:35] But Zakia, you too will have to 
keep your daughter at home.
[08:39] She doesn’t want to live here, 
she wants someone else to live here.
[08:47] But I want that you always live with us,
[08:51] if not as our daughter in law,
 then as a daughter.
[08:55] Don’t consider this my selfishness that
[09:01] in old age,
[09:03] I want your support.
[09:07] I don’t want to give Zakia
 another shock, Maheen.
[09:35] Hello mama.
[09:37] What?
[09:39] Has your anger cooled down?
[09:42] Are you upset with me?
[09:47] Mama, what is the matter?
[09:53] Roshni is saying that…
[09:59] What?
[10:01] What was Roshni saying?
[10:04] Maheen, why didn’t you 
tell me about Umar and Roshni?
[10:11] What would have I told you?
[10:14] Anyway, you found out now, mama.
[10:19] Now…
[10:24] Mama.
[10:31] Mama, you tell me yourself,
[10:35] if those two wanted,
[10:43] then they could have considered this wedding 
something written in fate and accepted it,
[10:51] and separated.
[10:57] But they couldn’t separate.
[11:03] Then,
[11:06] then what is the guarantee
[11:08] that this will happen in future?
[11:13] Walking on the blade of a sword and
[11:17] waiting for all my life, that maybe,
[11:23] maybe he will come back?
[11:31] Isn’t it better that you set him free.
[11:37] But you will not be free Maheen.
[11:40] You are a widow mother’s orphan child.
[11:45] You will not be free.
[11:48] What Roshni is saying today, 
the whole world will say tomorrow.
[11:56] What did Roshni say?
[11:59] She...
[12:01] She said that…
[12:03] Aunt,
[12:04] I am respecting you,
[12:06] if you want to know the real thing, 
then ask your daughter.
[12:09] What else?
[12:10] No woman lets her husband meet 
another woman without a reason.
[12:14] Mama, she is really cunning,
[12:16] she wants that the world doesn’t 
blame her for leaving Umar,
[12:19] and the whole world sympathizes with her,
[12:22] that Umar was having an affair.
[12:24] Hey, she herself wants to leave Umar, 
she wants freedom from him.
[12:27] What nonsense is this?
 Why would my Maheen do this?
[12:29] How would I know?
[12:31] Go ask her.
[12:32] She must have her eyes on someone else.
[12:34] Till the time, you don’t make arrangement for 
the second from the first, what girl does this?
[12:46] Maheen.
[12:47] Maheen.
[12:55] You don’t worry mama,
[12:59] God protects respect.
[13:02] I have protected someone’s respect,
[13:04] so by the will of God,
[13:07] I will also get respect.
[13:12] Please remove the fear in your heart,
[13:16] I am not coming back home.
[13:21] I am here,
[13:22] and I will live here
[13:25] and by the will of God,
[13:27] no one will throw this dirt on you.
[13:33] Don’t worry mama.
[14:17] Come in.
[14:23] Hello.
[14:26] Hello.
[14:28] We were waiting for you.
 Have a seat.
[14:41] What happened papa? 
Is everything ok? So much silence.
[14:44] Silence?
[14:46] Call it a mourning.
[14:47] Razia.
[14:49] Now it’s a mourning for us,
[14:52] it’s a celebration for him,
[14:53] its his victory,
[14:54] he should play the trumpet.
[14:57] Let me talk.
[15:06] After thinking hard,
[15:11] we have decided to agree to you, Umar.
[15:15] Not us Mr. Fareed, just you.
[15:20] And not agreeing to what you say,
[15:23] but giving up.
[15:28] But on one condition.
[15:31] Its not a condition for you,
[15:35] it was a condition for Maheen 
and she agreed,
[15:38] that is why the decision has 
been made in your favour.
[16:17] You have no responsibility on your Umar,
[16:20] apart from this,
[16:24] that your name will be 
attached to her till she wants.
[16:31] Maheen is my responsibility and 
I will live up to it, till my last breath.
[16:40] This was the only condition
 that Maheen has agreed to.
[16:47] Now no matter who comes in your life,
[16:51] Maheen will not leave from here.
[16:56] Maheen will not leave from here.
[18:13] Why did you agree, Maheen?
[18:16] Rest assured Umar,
[18:18] I will not be an issue for you.
[18:24] And what about the issues that
 will be created for you, those?
[18:37] Get up.
[19:15] Sit here.
[19:16] Sit.
[19:22] Look Maheen,
[19:26] Roshni loves me a lot
[19:29] and I don’t want that she sits waiting in my love,
 for my sake, all her life and ruin her life.
[19:39] That is why the situation came to this.
[19:42] You don’t even love me,
[19:46] then why are you doing all this for my sake?
[19:51] Why are you burdening me so much?
[19:56] I am doing all this to reduce your burden, Umar.
[20:00] If I hadn’t done this,
[20:02] uncle would never have taken this decision.
[20:07] For my sake, you accepted the decision.
[20:12] Why did you do it?
[20:13] Why are you doing all this?
[20:16] Tell me.
[20:20] Because.
[20:22] because…
[20:23] Now don’t say that
 you are my childhood friend,
[20:27] or you are my cousin.
[20:29] There is something else that
 is forcing you to do all this.
[20:38] Speak up.
[20:41] Love.
[20:47] This girl is an idiot,
[20:49] she is doing all this for her friend’s love.
[20:55] Who knows,
[20:58] if its for her friend’s love or Umar’s love.
[21:04] Umar’s love?
[21:06] Impossible.
[21:08] How can a woman share her husband
 with another woman in love.
[21:16] Love has thousand colors,
[21:20] some loves are crazy like yours,
[21:27] and some love is really patient.
[21:34] Really peaceful on the top
 but deep on the inside.
[21:42] Who knows,
[21:45] that girl really loves Umar, 
so much that we can’t even imagine.
[22:03] Love?
[22:06] Love.
[22:10] That I have with uncle, 
aunt, with mama.
[22:15] This is the desire of that love,
[22:18] that I give them that peace and comfort
[22:21] that they get knowing 
that I am with them here.
[22:28] This love has given me a lot,
[22:31] we have a lot of debt of our elders on us,
[22:35] which I might not have been
 able to repay it all my life.
[22:40] But now,
[22:42] God has given me a chance that 
I can return a little bit of that the love.
[22:49] After all,
[22:51] what better can I get than living under 
the shadow of uncle and love of aunt.
[23:13] I understand now.
[23:44] What happened? Is everything ok?
[23:46] Hey, when I am alone, 
you come immediately.
[23:49] Today, didn’t you know how long 
I have been walking alone?
[23:56] I was in your sister in law’s custody.
[23:59] Not all wives are like your Maheen,
 that they give them a freehand
[24:03] and they can do whatever they want.
[24:06] Come on, lets go on the roof.
[24:10] Come on. Come.
[24:18] Roshni,
[24:20] what you said to Zakia,
[24:22] Was all of it true?
[24:25] Which one?
[24:27] That Maheen wanted to marry someone else.
[24:31] You know, I don’t believe it,
 that she wanted to marry someone else.
[24:35] Mama, she is the good, I am bad!
[24:39] Then tell me, who was it?
[24:42] I don’t know, it must be someone.
[24:49] Damn it, were you blaming her?
[24:53] You have any idea,
 how big of sin is it to blame someone.
[24:56] Oh God, mama, why would I do it?
[24:58] I don’t have such habits,
[25:01] that is why I didn’t investigate further.
[25:03] Umar knows everything.
[25:05] Really?
[25:07] Then he is really a shameless man,
[25:08] that he is with his wife even 
after knowing everything.
[25:10] Shameless?
[25:12] Umar is an educated and enlightened man,
[25:15] he will keep me really happy 
and care for me.
[25:19] Especially when he finds out 
that I fixed his broken heart,
[25:24] when Maheen was leaving her and going.
[25:27] This thing has spread so much 
and you have become so egoistic,
[25:31] that now we just need to get the proposal.
[25:34] You will praise my far sightedness,
 how I have secured my future.
[25:39] Money is nothing,
[25:41] I have seen a lot of rich people,
[25:43] they are poor at heart,
[25:45] but someone as simple as Umar,
[25:47] its difficult to get in this world.
[25:49] You will see.
[26:09] Just once.
[26:12] Brother, just once had she protested,
[26:16] I swear to God,
[26:17] I would have given up.
[26:22] But it doesn’t matter to her,
[26:24] that she lives with me or not,
[26:27] whether my name is with her or not.
[26:29] It doesn’t matter to her.
[26:31] Does it matter to you?
[26:40] It matters to you Umar,
[26:44] but are not accepting it
[26:49] and its possible, 
she herself is hesitant to accept it.
[26:59] Umar, she went for a few days,
[27:03] did you look at your condition?
[27:08] You say that you didn’t accept her 
as your wife, from your heart.
[27:14] But the pain of her leaving was 
something you couldn’t tolerate
[27:22] and this is what you were upset about that 
how did she think of separating from you.
[27:28] Its not that.
[27:30] I was…
[27:31] First listen to me carefully Umar.
[27:38] Don’t try to cheat me the same way you 
have been cheating yourself for so long.
[27:47] When someone’s deepest desire is fulfilled 
they don’t have a sad face,
[27:53] like you have right now.
[27:59] Why are you not happy 
that papa agreed to you?
[28:05] Because he didn’t agree to it with his heart,
[28:09] and I also know, 
no one is happy in my happiness.
[28:12] First you become happy with your happiness
[28:15] and think that when Maheen said
[28:18] that she doesn’t want to live her 
life with you at any cost,
[28:22] she dislikes you a lot,
[28:25] then why did you feel so hurt?
[28:29] And when now she is not stopping you
from being someone else’s,
[28:33] then why are you so disappointed?
[28:38] Why do you want her to stop you?
[28:42] What do you want her to say?
[28:48] Think Umar.
[28:52] Think.
[29:42] I am really upset with sister Maheen,
[29:45] she doesn’t want to live in her home and 
she didn’t even let my home be settled.
[29:51] Look Fazeela, I respect your emotions,
[29:54] but right now, the mental stress and 
torture my sister is going through,
[29:58] you cannot even imagine.
[30:00] All of this are your sister’s actions.
[30:03] Roshni?
[30:04] I cannot expect anything from someone 
as cunning as Roshni.
[30:08] But your sister,
[30:09] at least she should have stopped,
[30:11] once we got married,
[30:12] she would have gotten her 
husband married again.
[30:15] All this is not that easy for Maheen.
[30:19] If you were in her place…
[30:20] God forbid if I were in her place.
[30:22] Still if I was in her place,
[30:24] I wouldn’t have done something so stupid.
[30:27] Sister Maheen has decided that 
she will ruin her own life,
[30:31] she will stay alone,
[30:33] but she wants to do this with all of us,
[30:35] she is ruining the happiness of everyone.
[30:38] And this Roshni?
[30:40] I will not leave this Roshni, 
I am telling you!
[30:45] After all, what is left to be done?
[30:48] One decision of Maheen,
[30:50] has tied her brother’s hands
[30:51] and if you look at it,
[30:52] I feel Maheen is more responsible,
 than Roshni.
[30:56] Monis, we are not talking about 
who is to blame and who not.
[31:00] Right now we are talking about
 that my life is ruined.
[31:03] We are not getting married, Monis.
[31:09] One wedding is not happening,
the other is getting ruined.
[31:14] Its all the fault of this wedding,
 the wedding has ruined everything!
[34:45] What? Really?
[34:47] They agreed?
[34:51] Or else I was going to tell you a scheme 
with which they would agree.
[34:54] Its good it wasn’t needed.
[34:59] What happened?
[35:01] Are you not happy?
[35:04] No.
[35:05] Don’t I look happy?
[35:06] I am happy.
[35:07] Obviously, man.
[35:10] So then tell me, 
what date are we fixing?
[35:12] Because my mother is in a hurry,
[35:14] because Maheen’s mother created a scene.
[35:16] So mama is worried that
 the people in the locality will find out.
[35:22] She is right.
[35:25] I think my family will come over
to your home in a day or two.
[35:30] By the will of God.
[35:32] Fine.
[35:34] That.
[35:38] We will just have a simple wedding.
[35:42] Why?
[35:44] Its your second wedding,
its my first wedding.
[35:49] I will have some wishes.
[35:52] I know. I understand,
[35:54] but see the situation 
we will just get married.
[36:01] Okay, leave it.
[36:02] After all, you will be with me, 
so each day will be a celebration.
[36:05] Let these people do what they want.
[36:12] There is something else.
[36:15] What happened now?
[36:21] Papa agreed to the wedding, but
[36:26] he has said that
[36:31] I can get married, but
[36:33] I cannot leave Maheen.
[36:36] Why can’t you leave her?
 What do you mean?
[36:40] Lower your voice, everyone is listening.
[36:43] He has put a condition.
[36:46] Did you agree to this condition?
[36:51] Roshni, papa has listened to so much I said,
[36:55] but this is not in my control,
[36:58] its his decision.
