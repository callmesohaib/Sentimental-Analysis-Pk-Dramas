[00:44] What happened Najia?
Do you have fever again?
[00:47] Am I am kid that I will cry on having fever?
[00:51] Then?
[00:53] Did mama say something?
[00:55] Yes.
[00:58] What did she say now?
[01:05] Have soup, have herbal tea,
[01:08] take your medication,
[01:09] should I boil eggs for you,
[01:11] why didn’t you wear sweater?
[01:14] Is this what she said?
[01:15] What is there to cry in this?
[01:20] Oh, so these are tears of happiness.
[01:24] This is what I am crying about that
she said all this to Maheen and not me.
[01:28] Like she is the one who falls ill
and I am nothing.
[01:32] Man, why do you go downstairs?
[01:35] Yes,
[01:36] imprison me in these two rooms,
[01:37] I don’t like going downstairs with
my damned face and increasing her BP.
[01:42] If I don’t go, then she questions,
[01:43] she doesn’t meet, she doesn’t say hello.
[01:46] If I go, then seeing me,
[01:49] she shows love to Maheen.
[01:51] I ask, have I never fallen ill?
She has never showered love like this to me.
[01:57] Okay, you come sit here.
[01:59] Come. Come, please.
[02:05] Okay,
[02:06] I asked you, right?
[02:08] I took an off from the office cause of you.
[02:13] Okay, tell me, should I take you shopping.
[02:15] No.
[02:19] Can I take you to your mother’s?
[02:21] Not at all.
[02:22] If I go there, she will see me
and realize I am not happy,
[02:24] and then her sarcasm,
see the result of a love marriage.
[02:34] Okay, let’s go out somewhere.
[02:37] Yes, I will take you for a movie.
[02:49] Roshni.
[02:52] Hey, Roshni.
[02:55] Where did you go?
[02:57] Roshni.
[03:02] Roshni.
[03:16] Where are you going?
[03:17] I am going to watch a movie with Maheen.
[03:22] What happened?
[03:23] You have doubts again?
[03:26] Come with me,
[03:28] see for yourself that Maheen is with me.
[03:31] I am not doubting it.
[03:33] If her in-laws are so strict,
[03:35] then why is she doing this
and giving them a reason?
[03:37] They will say that the friend comes
and takes her to watch a movie,
[03:42] that too hiding from the in-laws and husband.
[03:46] We are not going secretly,
the husband will be with us.
[03:52] Oh God,
[03:53] when the husband will be there,
then why are you going?
[03:55] What do you have to do between them?
[03:58] Mama, her husband is also stubborn and egoistic,
[04:05] he doesn’t talk properly to her.
[04:06] So poor Maheen asks me to come along,
she will also enjoy it.
[04:10] After all, her husband will go somewhere
else after the wedding, Maheen has to shop too.
[04:16] Roshni,
[04:17] whether he is stubborn or egoistic,
[04:19] he is her husband,
[04:20] she should compromise with the situation,
[04:23] I don’t understand
why Maheen is dragging you in between.
[04:27] If he minds, then?
[04:37] Objection, one after the other.
[04:39] The deal is that you doubt me,
[04:43] that I take Maheen’s name
and go somewhere else.
[04:46] Now the husband and
wife will pick me and drop me back,
[04:51] will you be satisfied then?
[04:53] If I tell you the right thing, you argue with me.
[04:57] Neither you or Maheen have a brain,
[04:59] after all, girls of today,
[05:01] they have no brains, nor they listen.
[05:04] Do what you want.
[05:06] Hear one thing out clearly,
[05:08] I will also pray a lot for your wedding.
[05:11] I hope you get married soon,
[05:13] so that I am at peace.
[05:15] Move now.
[05:16] Amen.
[05:19] Bye.
[05:36] Maheen,
[05:37] why are you not ready yet?
[05:40] You said you would come by 5, it’s just 3:30.
[05:44] Well you don’t have to dress up that much.
[05:45] Give this to me. Come on, give it.
[05:48] I thought we have to pick Roshni
[05:51] and if we are going
we will say hello to aunt Zakia, okay?
[05:54] Here, done.
[05:55] Come on.
[06:00] Thank you.
[06:02] You are being sarcastic?
[06:05] I am thinking you.
[06:07] Okay, go, hurry up.
[06:24] Oh, who is calling?
[06:31] Hello.
[06:33] Yes, hello, how are you sister?
[06:37] Yes, yes.
[06:39] What?
[06:42] No, nothing like that, I feel that…
[06:46] listen to me.
[06:49] Hey sister,
 I think there is some confusion.
[06:52] Hello?
[07:01] I don’t understand,
where all will this girl get me insulted.
[07:24] Tea.
[07:25] Thank you.
[07:30] Listen,
[07:35] don’t tell anyone downstairs that 
we are going to watch a movie.
[07:40] Okay,
[07:42] I was thinking of asking Umar…
[07:44] I could hear voices from downstairs Maheen 
and Umar are planning to go watch a movie.
[07:48] Just leave it, it’s different with them.
[07:52] They are extra special.
[07:54] She is making an excuse of having flu 
and making everyone take care of her,
[07:57] if she goes no one will say anything,
[07:59] but if we go everyone will insult us 100 times.
[08:03] First they will say I stopped my husband saying I am unwell 
and then I took you out to roam around.
[08:09] Ok tell me what do you want to wear,
 I will iron it.
[08:12] Some good pant and shirt.
[08:54] Monis.
[08:56] Monis.
[08:57] Yes mama.
[08:57] Monis, call Mahi,
[09:00] heard she came and left from the lane,
[09:04] she didn’t even see how her mother is.
[09:06] how is this possible?
[09:07] Yes, that is what I am thinking.
[09:09] Roshni’s mother was saying that she came, 
took Roshni and the three of us went to watch a movie.
[09:14] Now call them and find out that 
when they come back after the film,
[09:17] will they stay, have food and go,
[09:20] if yes, I will cook something.
[09:23] Obviously, if they come they will stay.
[09:27] Mama, all this doesn’t seem strange to you?
[09:29] Those two took Roshni for a movie.
[09:35] She is her childhood friend.
[09:38] Still mama, when she comes talk to her,
[09:41] you know Umar is weird and these things matter.
[09:47] Aunt might raise an issue on these things.
[09:52] You are right,
[09:54] when she comes I will talk to her.
[09:57] But call her,
[09:59] if I have to cook something, 
then tell me on time.
[10:09] Are you happy now? Are you at peace?
[10:11] Yes, completely at peace,
[10:12] that she sat with you with her right in front 
and I was sitting in the back seat.
[10:15] Now she will sit in between us during the movie.
[10:18] No, two tickets, she will shop.
[10:30] What happened Maheen?
[11:14] Listen, should we get something to eat…
one minute. One minute, isn’t that Umar?
[11:34] What happened? Was it Umar?
[11:36] Man, I don’t know,
 maybe, I didn’t get who it was.
[11:40] What do you mean you didn’t get it?
 You came running, did you not see?
[11:43] Hey, the show tickets will end, 
it’s a good movie, we won’t get it later.
[11:47] Come on lets go.
[11:48] Fine, but…listen.
[11:49] Yeah. Yeah.
[11:50] Lets eat something, I am hungry.
[11:53] Can I say something, that was Umar,
[11:56] I saw someone with him, 
but it wasn’t Maheen, I saw a glimpse.
[12:00] I don’t know they were talking downstairs…
[12:15] Its good you got me out here, I feel better.
[12:18] I always say the right thing to you,
 if you agree to me.
[12:23] Yeah, yeah.
[12:27] I had told you that was Umar,
 you don’t listen to me.
[12:30] Maheen.
[12:34] Hello.
[12:35] Hello.
[12:36] Hello.
[12:36] Sit.
[12:37] See how we raided.
[12:39] We ruined your movie date, right?
[12:43] Where is Umar?
[12:47] Umar, aaa, he dropped me and left.
[12:51] Dropped me and left, meaning?
[12:56] He had some important work suddenly,
[13:01] and if we would drop me home,
[13:03] it would take a lot of time 
so I asked him to drop me here,
[13:06] so I will shop till he comes back.
[13:11] But Umar was…
[13:15] okay fine,
[13:16] you come and watch the movie with us. No?
[13:20] No,
[13:22] sister in law, I have to leave, I was going.
[13:25] One minute, you just said you are waiting for Umar, 
you have to shop, now where are you going?
[13:30] Umar,
[13:32] messaged that he will get late 
so I am thinking I will go home,
[13:38] I will see aunt too, or else it will be late.
[13:41] You people enjoy.
[13:42] Maheen, go with us, eat something.
[13:44] No, I will go. Home.
[13:46] I will meet you at home.
[13:48] Maheen.
[13:49] Bye.
[13:50] Bye. Bye.
[13:54] She could have gone with us,
 she should have eaten and stayed.
[13:57] I don’t know what these people are doing.
[14:00] Maheen, stay, go with us.
[14:02] Sister in law, next time.
[14:05] Is this something smart done by Umar, 
he left her alone here.
[14:07] If we had not come,
 then what would she have done.
[14:10] What is Umar doing?
[14:52] What is this nonsense?
[14:53] At least you should have let me enjoy the movie. 
The interval started and you got me out.
[14:57] One minute, I told you the whole issue.
[14:59] They didn’t see us and you said Maheen made an excuse,
 so why did we come out so quickly.
[15:04] Thank God they didn’t see us,
[15:06] the problem is brother Mansoor 
was somewhere over here.
[15:09] When Maheen messaged me,
[15:10] I didn’t step out then cause I feared meeting 
brother Mansoor and sister in law with him.
[15:14] Its my fault I messaged brother Mansoor 
that I am watching a movie with Maheen.
[15:20] What is this nonsense Umar?
[15:22] The issue is,
[15:23] that poor Maheen stepped out cause of this,
 she is waiting downstairs.
[15:27] Poor thing?
[15:30] Don’t you know why this is happening 
and cause of whom.
[15:33] What do you mean?
[15:35] She told aunt Zakia that
 I didn’t come to meet her,
[15:37] and your brother and sister in law 
here also has Maheen’s hand in it.
[15:42] Roshni, don’t think that, 
come on come please. Come.
[16:26] So much wait,
[16:29] you are cold as ice, are you ok?
[16:33] Yes,
[16:34] I didn’t know when stepping out of 
the house that the weather is cold,
[16:38] so I didn’t keep a sweater.
[16:39] I will get a shawl for you.
[16:42] Umar, will you have tea?
[16:43] No thank you, we just came to say hello.
[16:48] You people now come as guests.
[16:50] I will get the shawl.
[16:55] I am sorry man,
[16:57] I didn’t realize you stood there in the cold, 
now please don’t fall ill, please.
[17:02] I won’t.
[17:03] Here, put this on.
[17:06] Okay, Maheen lets go.
[17:07] Bye mama.
[17:08] Mama is calling too. 
I am waiting in the car.
[17:10] Okay son, bye.
[17:11] Bye.
[17:12] Bye.
[17:12] Mama, I wanted to talk to you.
[17:15] Go ahead.
[17:16] If you talk to aunt, 
brother Mansoor or anyone at home,
[17:22] don’t tell them that Roshni was not with us.
[17:24] That’s what I wanted to tell you too,
[17:26] that when you know your 
mother in law doesn’t like all this,
[17:30] then why did you take Roshni along?
[17:33] Actually…
[17:35] Look, a mother in law doesn’t like
 a daughter in law going to her mother’s
[17:39] or her son going to his in-laws often, 
and here you took your friend along.
[17:43] This was the first time mama.
[17:45] First and last time, ok?
[17:49] Go now, Umar is waiting.
[17:51] Bye.
[17:51] Bye.
[18:03] They are all standing here.
[18:05] Umar,
[18:07] come upstairs, I want to talk to you.
[18:09] Hello brother Mansoor.
[18:11] Hello.
[18:12] He will investigate, what do I do?
[18:16] I am embarrassed myself,
[18:19] even my lie was caught,
 what will they be thinking.
[18:22] What was the need to say that
 I dropped you outside and left.
[18:26] What else could I say?
[18:28] I didn’t plan anything, I didn’t think, 
they came in front of me suddenly, I didn’t think about it.
[18:33] You should have called me, 
or messaged me or something.
[18:36] Okay, go now, you go to the room first.
[18:50] They didn’t even let me watch the full movie, 
I don’t know what sort of people they are.
[18:54] If they don’t get along, what can I do?
[19:00] Roshni,
[19:03] what new adventure did you do?
[19:06] What adventure? What did I do?
[19:10] The boy’s family called and
they said no to the wedding,
[19:13] I know this is all your doing.
[19:17] Oh, okay,
[19:21] so they said no.
[19:23] but why do you blame me for everything?
[19:25] I found those people useless,
[19:28] thank God my wedding didn’t happen there.
[19:31] I don’t understand what sin I committed 
that I got a daughter like you.
[19:38] That Maheen,
[19:39] she doesn’t adjust and survive,
 nor does she let anyone else adjust.
[19:42] Hey, there was one good proposal,
[19:45] you drew it away.
[19:47] mama,
[19:48] whether it’s a proposal or train,
[19:50] one goes the next comes.
[19:53] Get it written anywhere.
[19:54] Get lost, damned woman.
[19:56] Hear one thing clearly,
[19:58] the way you take everything as a joke,
[20:01] what if your life becomes a joke.
[20:22] Umar.
[20:31] You lied to me?
[20:33] Now don’t deny it.
[20:37] No, I am not denying it,
[20:41] yes, I said the wrong thing to you 
that I was with Maheen,
[20:50] but I was in a little hurry so I ignored you.
[20:55] But I cannot be ignored easily,
[20:58] now tell me in detail, we have a lot of time.
[21:04] What detail do you want brother?
[21:09] I got an important call, so I had to go, 
so I left Maheen and went.
[21:14] Then why did you lie to me?
[21:18] You would have given me a lecture, 
I was not in the mood to listen to any lecture.
[21:21] You didn’t leave her alone and go anywhere Umar,
[21:26] Najia saw you going to watch the movie herself.
[21:33] Sister in law?
[21:34] Yes,
[21:37] and someone else was with you.
[21:46] What?
[21:48] What are you saying brother Mansoor?
[21:50] What happened to you?
[21:51] You are believing sister in law,
[21:54] you know she creates a scene for no reason.
[21:59] She was the one who used 
to say that me and Maheen…
[22:02] leave her. Don’t believe her please. 
I am sure she mistaken.
[22:07] I convinced your sister in law somehow,
[22:11] I didn’t tell her about this lie of yours
 or this message of yours,
[22:15] but you cannot convince me Umar.
[22:20] What I am feeling,
[22:23] if it turns out to be true,
[22:26] then you are not safe.
[22:38] I am usually really safe in life.
[22:42] You are not safe.
[22:56] Mama.
[23:03] Mama.
[23:05] Give me breakfast,
[23:07] I am really hungry, 
I have not eaten since last night.
[23:10] What misers, they took you to watch a movie 
and didn’t even feed you anything.
[23:15] They were asking me to eat but I didn’t like it,
[23:19] the two of them had 
so much tension in between them,
[23:21] you know we didn’t even watch the complete movie.
[23:24] Oh, why?
[23:25] I told you 10 thousand times mama,
[23:27] Maheen’s husband doesn’t give her importance,
[23:29] so she worries and calls me.
[23:33] Poor thing.
[23:35] Now I don’t know
 if she is the poor thing or her husband.
[23:38] Why would he be poor?
[23:42] Mama, look Maheen is my friend,
[23:46] my sympathies are with her,
[23:48] but if you ask me the truth,
[23:51] that man has been cheated,
[23:53] its an unmatched wedding.
[23:55] Umar is well educated,
[23:57] Maheen is FA fail.
[23:58] Umar is out going and newage,
 Maheen is stay home and stupid type.
[24:04] Umar, has a pleasant personality, 
Maheen is a crying face,
[24:08] doesn’t know how to wear good clothes, 
nor can she talk well.
[24:11] Now you have to suffer in the forced weddings.
[24:15] She will suffer, the boy won’t.
[24:19] What’s with boys,
[24:21] they can get married for 
the second and third time.
[24:25] So he can get married for 
the second and third time,
[24:28] God gave him the right.
[24:31] Yes,
[24:32] you know there is something great 
about this decision of my God.
[24:36] You have the bread.
[24:39] You won’t have it?
[24:40] I will.
[24:48] The bread is good, right?
[24:49] Yeah.
[24:50] Maheen.
[24:53] Maheen,
[24:55] hey, Maheen.
[24:59] Yes aunt, sorry.
[25:00] WooI have been calling you for so long, 
why can’t you hear me?
[25:03] I am going to the neighbors, see the home, 
I mean see the food, don’t act naïve like Najia.
[25:12] What should I cook aunt.
[25:14] There is chicken, vegetables, mutton,
 in the fridge, cook what you want.
[25:19] You cook well anyway.
[25:21] Don’t worry, I will cook.
[25:24] Listen,
[25:26] the maid has not come for three days,
[25:27] a lot of clothes are gathered, wash the clothes.
[25:33] Why are you not answering? 
I didn’t give you a difficult task.
[25:36] No aunt,
[25:38] I was thinking whether I should wash 
the clothes or cook.
[25:41] Do what you want, 
I don’t expect anything from that dumb Najia,
[25:46] it would be enough 
if she can handle herself and her husband.
[25:49] Okay, I will go now.
[25:51] Clean everything before mama
 comes out or she will say things.
[25:55] Yes.
[26:16] Roshni, why are you not picking my calls,
 nor are you answering my messages.
[26:24] Is all ok?
[26:35] What happened, Umar?
[26:39] Nothing papa.
[26:42] Is there an issue?
[26:44] No, what issue can there be?
[26:49] If you are not well, then go home early.
[26:54] No, I am fine.
[27:18] Razia.
[27:21] Razia.
[27:22] Oh God, where is this Razia?
[27:26] Since the daughter in law came,
 she goes out to have fun.
[27:30] Razia.
[27:32] Yes, grandma.
[27:33] Where is Razia?
[27:35] Aunt has gone to the neighbors, 
that aunt has got pneumonia.
[27:40] She went to see her.
[27:42] Wow and even if you get pneumonia,
[27:45] she wouldn’t care,
[27:46] she has the pain of the whole locality in her heart.
[27:50] Grandma, why would I get pneumonia?
[27:53] You had flu till yesterday,
[27:56] you don’t get pneumonia
[27:58] but is this the way that one month old bride is made 
to cook food and leaving the home on her.
[28:05] Does she not remember her time,
[28:07] six months,
[28:09] she didn’t go to the kitchen for six months.
[28:14] Grandma, she didn’t put such a big task on me,
 I was frying potatoes just like that.
[28:20] Like I don’t know, I can’t see.
[28:23] Were you using the washing 
machine in the morning,
[28:26] if the maid didn’t come a day 
the clothes were not washed,
[28:29] then what is the big deal?
[28:31] She would come tomorrow,
 the clothes will be washed.
[28:33] But no, whether its winter or summers.
[28:36] She will make you work on the washing machine.
[28:39] Now see, she has put you in front of the stove 
and gone herself to meet her friends.
[28:44] No grandma, she didn’t give me any such work,
[28:48] the maid took two days off, 
so we would had a pile of clothes,
[28:52] secondly, aunt herself set up the washing machine,
[28:56] I was just helping her put 
the clothes on the clothesline,
[29:00] that too towards the end and 
she was asking me not to and that potatoes,
[29:05] I wanted to have chips, so I was frying those…
[29:12] Like I don’t know.
[29:14] Come on go now, go make chips, 
make some for me too.
[29:20] Grandma...
[29:28] This Razia is just…
[31:47] Should I take tea for uncle.
[31:50] I just gave it to him.
[31:52] You should have told me, I would have taken it.
[31:55] When I went to the neighbors, 
was mama saying something.
[31:59] No,
[32:01] she was asking where you went,
[32:03] I told her.
[32:04] I am sure she created a scene and also that 
I gave you all the work in the kitchen.
[32:12] No, not at all.
[32:14] Did you tell mama, 
you washed clothes in the morning?
[32:20] What is wrong in that aunt?
[32:22] You have a washing machine,
[32:24] at mama’s I used to wash clothes with my hands.
[32:27] Here you have a machine, 
a maid and you do the rest of the work,
[32:32] grandma knows all this.
[32:34] Don’t cover up, I know mama well,
[32:38] she must try to pollute your mind
 by saying that I am not your aunt,
[32:42] but your mother in law and that too 
a hitler mother in law.
[32:46] Not at all.
[32:49] You know when you are not around,
[32:52] grandma tells not to consider you 
as my mother in law,
[32:56] nor aunt,
[32:57] consider you my mother and take care of you.
[33:01] She tells me that you took care of her all your life 
and I have to take care of you like that.
[33:07] Okay,
[33:09] you go to your room,
[33:11] when Umar comes from work, give him time.
[33:14] Come on.
[33:38] Will you have tea?
[33:39] No.
[33:45] Are you hungry?
[33:47] No, man.
[33:50] Should I put on the TV?
[33:52] What is wrong Maheen,
[33:54] if I want to watch TV, I will put it on.
[33:56] Sorry,
[33:58] grandma told me to spend time with you.
[34:01] Okay come here, sit. Come on sit here.
[34:08] Did you talk to Roshni, I mean today.
[34:13] No.
[34:16] You call her please.
[34:19] Me? Why?
[34:21] just ask her if she is ok,
 is there an issue with her.
[34:27] So you call him.
[34:30] Man, I tried, she didn’t answer, 
she is not replying to my messages.
[34:33] That has never happened. 
I want to ask if all is ok.
[34:37] Do it man.
[34:39] How do I call her Umar, 
what do I say to her?
[34:43] Man, call her, she is your friend, 
you can call her when you want.
[34:49] She is not my friend anymore.
[34:51] Where is your phone.
[34:55] She is not my friend.
[34:59] Call her, you call her.
[35:02] Call her. She is really sensitive.
[35:04] I don’t know what she minded, 
I am worried for her,
[35:08] I don’t know man,
[35:10] what is the issue, why is she not picking up?
[35:14] Did her mother find out about us?
[35:16] If she did she will treat her badly.
[35:21] Try it please.
[35:30] Umar was lost and worried today.
[35:35] Yes, he had a long face when he came home
and he went to this room immediately.
[35:40] Oh, okay,
[35:44] that is why all day long,
[35:47] he had his phone in his hand,
[35:49] some times message, 
some times call, new marriage.
[35:54] Now you don’t get after her that 
he went to the room as soon as he came home.
[35:58] I am no Hitler,
[36:00] I told Maheen to go to her husband, 
sit with him, talk to him, give him time.
[36:07] You did good.
[36:10] Obviously the wedding happened suddenly,
[36:12] it takes time to transition from 
the old relation to the new one
[36:17] and we need to help them to understand each other,
[36:22] that’s how love increases between husband and wife.
[36:25] What do you say?
[36:27] Our elders used to say this.
[36:30] Yes you don’t know anything.
[37:24] What happened Maheen?
[37:26] She didn’t answer.
[37:29] Call on her home number,
[37:32] her mother might pick up 
but we will know if she is fine.
[37:35] You will argue with me 
why I said this and why I said that,
[37:40] I cannot make stories, 
I cannot lie, don’t make me do this.
[37:46] What big task did I tell you to do,
[37:48] I just asked you to call,
[37:49] we will know she is fine, 
my heart will be at peace,
[37:53] its not such a big task, 
can’t you do this much for me?
