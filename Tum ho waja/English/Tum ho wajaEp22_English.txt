Do you know? The guy that your son has hit is in ICU right now.
You just pray that he survives otherwise your son will be hung for sure.
Only you can do something, sir!
You… please, get him out of here somehow! He’s completely innocent!
It’s not in my hands anymore. I can’t help you in any way.
Can I meet my son?
Actually, the investigation is going on right now
and no one is permitted to meet during that.
I won’t leave without meeting my son!
What language do you understand, miss?
Didn’t I just say you can’t meet your son?
So that means that you can’t!
I won’t go from here!
Saifullah!
Yes sir!
Saifullah, get her out of here.
I won’t go from here!
Miss, try to understand and leave otherwise I’ll have to forcefully kick you out.
Saifullah! Get her out of here.
Miss, get up and leave.
Come.
You two must be really happy today, no?
Seeing me cry over here like this.
And you should be happy, Sitara. Your curse worked on Babar,
I and our happiness.
Sister in law, you’re thinking wrong.
I can never wish badly upon my brother.
You reap what you sow!
So now you’re going to speak up too?
You’ll tell me off, make fun of me!
Alright.
I’m a very bad person, right?
My end should be bad too!
I’m leaving from here! I’ll live in my house, alone.
No matter what happens!
What has happened, sister in law! Don’t take offence from what he said!
What has happened, sister in law? Where are you going…
What was the need for you to say all that! Now go and find her and also see where uncle is!
Mom must be alone at the station!
It’s a tea time.
She must be bringing it!
You? Wait!
What are you doing here?
And who brings just tea? Shameem!
Shameem! Look and bring everything properly in a tray! You go away!
You go back, maid!
Come on, go!
Come, let’s take a selfie for social media!
It will be memorable!
Wow! I’ll tag you. It’ll get famous!
Shebi!
You got her all the clothes, done with all the wedding shopping?
Sana, I hope you liked your clothes…
Of course, aunty!
I love them all.
Shahab has a wonderful taste.
You wait. I’ll bring them and show you.
Yes, yes of course!
Alright so, I wanted to talk about the Mehr.
Who is Mehar?
Dower.
Oh, dower! You may write as you wish!
What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is mine.
What’s Shebi’s is Sana’s and what’s Sana’s is Shebi’s!
That means it’s ours only, right?
Chanda! Wait
Look,
my wedding dress!
You ran away and got married, right?
You probably didn’t get the chance to become a bride.
But won’t I look nice?
Shahab will never marry you.
Why don’t you just believe the fact that you’re just a maid over here?
Because Shahab…
Enough!
Enough!
I don’t want to hear Shahab’s name from your mouth ever again
otherwise you’ll see what I do!
And listen!
Bring the rest of the things inside!
Babar! Babar!
Mom!
Mom, what are you doing here?
What happened? What did you do? What is all this?
I have made a very big mistake!
You were right when you told me I should control my anger.
I am paying for my anger today!
But what could I have done, mom?
He was taking Erum with him, what could I have done?
Your uncle is coming. We’ll find a solution for this.
What’s going on? Get out of here! Come on, get out!
On minute. What are you doing? We’re talking.
Oh, you shut up! I don’t care if you’re talking!
Talk with some respect, she’s my mother!
I’ll talk to you with respect! Come on now! Get out of here!
Keep the stick down! Keep the stick down!
Shut up!
Mom, you leave! There’s no need to deal with these ill-mannered people!
You go. Quiet! Don’t make noise inside. Stay quiet!
It must be mom!
Sister in law! What happened? What did the police say?
For god sake save my child, Murad!
You don’t worry. I have contacts in the police.
I will go and talk to him.
You guys just do one thing and bring Erum back.
It’s not safe for her to stay over there.
Why, where did she go?
She got upset and left!
What? What happened? Why did she leave?
Sister in law, this is not the time to argue. You just bring her back, I’ll go!
Go! Go and find out!
You sit down please! I’ll get water.
Who is Babar out of you all?
Come on, get up! Sir is calling you. You have gotten the bail!
Erum,
don’t be stubborn.
They can come back anytime and harm you.
You come with us!
That’ll be good!
They should just kill me once and for all!
It’s better than living a suffocating life like this every day!
Don’t say that.
We’re already so tensed,
you please don’t add to our worries.
It’s not right for you to live alone over here.
I apologize to you on mine and Zain’s behalf. Please, let it go
and get going with us right now
Didn’t I just say? I don’t want to go anywhere with you guys!
Come out!
You ruined our respect and put our brother in death’s face
and you’re sitting over here?
Come out otherwise we’ll come inside and kill you!
Is that your cousin’s family?
Seems like they have left.
Listen to me!
You won’t stay here at any cost now!
I have heard enough from you.
Now get up, pack your stuff and come with us!
Yes, I’ll just help you pack. Let’s go from here!
Come on, hurry up.
What are you doing over here?
Are you grieving?
re you going to ruin my child’s happiness with your evil eyes?
You remember how I locked you in the quarter, right? I’ll lock you again!
Get up! And get out of here!
! I don’t want to see you here again, do you understand?
My lovely wife! You... you sit together. Yes.
Here you go.
The rings are here!
Take this, take this, Shebi! And my child, this is yours.
Come on, Shebi. Go ahead.
Shahab.
Hold on!
This engagement cannot happen!
Stop this nonsense!
I am your wife, you love me!
How can you do this engagement, Shahab?
And you guys!
What show are you waiting for?
What is happening over here?
He’s my husband!
How can you go ahead with this marriage?
We promised to spend a lifetime with each other.
We love each other.
. I have apologized to you as well.
Please!
Please, Shahab!
Throw away this ring. Don’t do this.
Don’t do this to me! Please!
You’re right.
I love you.
Shebi!
Come on.
Come on, son. Put it in her finger.
You too!
Happy birthday….
Happy engagement!
Let’s go for the dinner, inter-continental.
Please, you tell me everything honestly. What is the actual matter?
What should I tell you, Sitara?
The FIR has been lodged.
Babar is in a very big trouble, my child.
The truth is that the entire game is of money.
They have filed a complaint against him for attempt to murder.
To be honest if they want, they can also get him murdered through target killing!
You take me to the station.
I’ll beg them, cry in their feet. I just want them to free my brother, that’s it!
No, my child, no.
The police doesn’t budge by begging.
There must be some way!
There’s only one way I can think of.
And that way goes to Wajid Sahib.
Look, my child. Wajid Sahib is a very understanding and calm man.
I’m sure if sister in law talks to him herself, he will find a way out!
Why have you brought me over here?
To free you!
To free me? But why over here? It’s so dark.
Don’t argue much!
What are you doing? Run from here! Run from here!
Brother! Brother!
What happened, Sitara?
Mom! Save Bhai!
Save Bhai! They are going to kill him! Please!
Nothing is going to happen to your brother.
I want to go him right now! I want to meet him right now!
Take me to him! Take me to him!
Zain, my child!
Zain, open the door.
I want to meet Bhai, please! They will kill him! They will kill him!
Sister in law, is everything alright?
Uncle!
She saw a bad dream so she’s freaking out.
Uncle, please bring Bhai back!
Right now! Go to Wajid Sahib right now!
Be strong, nothing’s going to happen! Babar is absolutely fine.
Everything will be fine! Look, listen to me.
You have faith in Allah, right? Keep your trust in Allah, everything will be fine!
Sitara, my child. It’s gotten very late right now.
I’ll take you to the police station tomorrow morning. Alright?
You aren’t listening to me!
My child, this is not the right time. It’s not appropriate to go over there at this hour.
You go to Wajid Sahib right now.
Ask him to please get my brother out of there!
Please, go right now!
Listen to me! I’ll go myself in the morning.
You go!
I’ll go! I’ll go with your uncle. Lay down.
Take this, my child.
You have seen a bad dream. Everything will be fine. Keep your trust in Allah.
Sister in law, give her this water.
Have water.
In Sha Allah, everything will be fine. Go to sleep right now.
Allah will make everything better.
Yes. Alright, Murad. Alright.
Everything will be fine.
What are you two doing over here?
This is not the right place. It doesn’t have nice people.
You shouldn’t have brought Sitara over here.
Who else would have come along with mom if not me?
Who do we have other than you?
You are our only support.
Forgive me.
All that is happening with me today is due to my ill behavior towards you.
I should not have done that with you guys. I have hurt you guys a lot.
Don’t say that.
You can do anything, I won’t feel hurt.
I just can’t see you in trouble.
I have no complaints with you.
How do you not have any complaints with me?
I was your only support.
You guys were my responsibility.
I was blindfolded. I… I am very ashamed.
Everything will be fine!
Nothing will be fine.
They are very scary people.
They will get me hung at any cost.
God forbid!
Don’t say such things. You don’t have to lose hope.
We are with you, right? We will get you out of here.
You can’t do anything.
I just have one request for you guys.
No matter what happens to me, take care of Erum.
She…
she’s about to become a mother.
What?
Come on, miss. The meeting time is over. You guys can leave now.
Yes, brother. We are just leaving. Please give this food to him.
You keep this for you tea and biscuits.
Alright, I’ll have to give you some time now.
You can’t lose hope.
Don’t worry.
We are with you.
We won’t let anything happen to you.
Many congratulations.
Take loads of care of yourself.
You won’t feel troubled over here.
Bhai will be back soon, In Sha Allah.
In Sha Allah.
Who are you calling?
Hello? Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
Please come back as soon as possible.
Mom wants to go to Wajid Sahib’s house.
Yes. Alright.
Okay.
You will have to go, mom.
Yes, mom.
You ask him to please help us.
No matter how much it costs, we’ll return it all back to him.
I’ll work myself!
Mom, I’ll teach in a school. I’ll give tuitions too.
We’ll pay back the entire loan. We just want Bhai to come back right now.
Do you know?
To tell you the truth, I did pity her a little
but then I thought, after what she’s done with your child….
I mean,
how can a mother kill her own child?
She should have taken care of herself.
Yes. My child.
How can a mother take away her child’s life?
I know that she did all of this deliberately.
I won’t spare her! I’ll take my revenge.
She’ll go through the same pain I am going through today!
Sana! Sana, forget everything.
I really love you a lot.
In fact, I have felt real love after meeting you!
What is this behavior?
And what are you doing with me?
You used to have such romantic talks with me!
And today, you’re saying the same things to someone else in front of me?
What has happened to you! Respond to me!
Because I’m sick of you!
I’m tired!
Don’t stand in front of me with all these questions
because neither do I have the answers to your questions, nor can I give them!
At least listen to me
Alright, that’s nice.
At least Tayi Jaan got a good news to hear.
It’s just a few drops of rain that have fallen on a hot desert sand.
Is everything alright, Sitara?
Do you or anybody else have any difficulty?
Uncle really takes care of us.
Then why are you so sad? Why do you seem so tensed, Sitara?
Bhai is in the lock up, Danish.
What are you saying, Sitara?
How? When? What did he do?
Neither did dad inform me, nor did Tayi Jaan tell me anything.
We are very worried, Danish.
I don’t know why our destiny has so much pain written in it.
I don’t know when all these worries are going to go away from our lives
and when we will be in peace.
It feels like our tears have dried out too now.
Every day starts with a new difficulty,
new tension and a new trial.
You don’t worry, Sitara.
I’ll talk to dad. He’ll get Babar Bhai out of there anyhow!
Uncle is trying his best but I don’t know when Bhai is going to come.
He will come, Sitara. Of course he will! You don’t worry
Worried?
You went to Dubai,
Bhai is in the lockup, we’re going around here and there
and you’re saying I shouldn’t be worried?
Don’t say such disappointing things, Sitara.
I don’t know what Allah Almighty wants from us, Danish.
How much more helplessness is written in our destiny?
Don’t say such things, Sitara. I’ll talk to dad. You be strong and have faith.
I’ll call you again. Alright?
Khuda Hafiz.
Yes, he has beaten him. When did I deny from that?
Don’t say that, Munir Sahib.
There must be some way, some solution to get Babar out of there.
Yes! This can be done.
You mean, I should talk to them and let you know?
Alright! Alright, I’ll get back to you.
What was he saying, Wajid Sahib?
He said that there can be two ways.
One is through the court,
where the cases go on for years but bail isn’t possible.
God forbid that our Babar goes through that, Wajid Sahib.
What’s the other way?
The other way is that we get the matter resolved by paying some amount.
How much?
Around 45-50 lacs.
50 lacs?
Wajid Sahib, this is a very big amount.
I spoke to him right in front of you.
My child is going to die like that!
This is very unfair.
Wajid Sahib, I know that you can do a lot if you try.
You are our only support right now.
You will have to do something.
Alright, I’ll find a way out. Don’t worry.
The minimum I can do is request them to not raise their hand on him.
And anyway, there’s a strike at the court tomorrow so the session won’t take place either.
We will have to do something before taking him to the court day after tomorrow.
Alright, Wajid Sahib.
I’ll... arrange some amount of money.
Aapi! Have you made this for me?
Move! This for sister in law.
Why are you always making everything for her?
She still isn’t normal with us.
Why are you and mom spoiling her by taking care of her?
You’re a kid, right? Then talk like kids do!
Alright, listen.
When is the baby coming?
What did I just say to you? Talk like kids!
! I don’t have an answer to every question of yours!
Where’s the ring?
Chanda! Chanda!
Yes?
Where is this set’s ring?
I don’t know. I gave all the sets and everything to you.
But the ring isn’t there, right? Where is its ring?
I don’t know.
What do you mean you don’t know? Did you give it to your family? Tell me! Speak!
I didn’t give anything to anyone…
You got saved.
Go!
Hello?
Yes, brother!
I am just on my way to your shop.
Actually, my son is getting married so I have to get some jewelry made for my daughter in law.
That marriage ended!
My poor son was stuck.
, yes. You just take all the new and nice designs out.
I don’t want any from the ancient times!
Alright then. I’ll see when I come.
Mom, please.
Sister in law, what I’m about to say is something that my heart doesn’t agree on
and neither do I know how to say it.
What happened, uncle? What is it?
My child, we just have one way left to save Babar.
What is that, uncle?
My child, the amount of money that we need for Babar’s bail
cannot be arranged by Danish or me.
There’s no need to tell Danish anything!
Sister in law, I wanted the same.
He’s abroad, he’ll get worried for no reason but she’s a child, she called him out of worry.
What was the need to tell him?
Everyone has made me sick!
I don’t know how to get rid of this problem!
Sister in law, you sell your house.
We don’t have any other way now.
Look, this house of bricks and stones isn’t more precious than our children’s lives, right?
Sister in law, god forbid if something happens to Babar then…
I just want my son back!
Why didn’t I think of this before?
There’s just one day left now.
You’ll have to do something soon!
Yes, yes. I will try my best to get this done by tomorrow.
Sister in law, the house documents…
They’re kept in the locker at home. Erum gave me the key.
I am just worried about how hurt the children will be when they find out about this.
Their father built this house for them with so much love…
Don’t tell anyone anything right now
You’re absolutely right. This is what we should do!
I’ll bring the key. You just go and get the papers. Do something today only!
In Sha Allah, I’ll talk to Wajid Sahib right now only.
Congratulations, Murad!
You’ve done it.
I’ll talk to Wajid Sahib right now.
Yes of course. I’ll be there in half an hour, okay? Bye!
Oh! You know what aunty says is right! You have a very unpleasant face.
The entire day goes bad once we’ve seen your face, I swear!
Actually, this happens to people who are doing me wrong!
They get scared from the inside,
they get worried thinking about how Allah is going to punish them!
Like you!
You are so scared of me!
Did you forget?
Shahab refused to you for marriage
because he loves me!
But you couldn’t bear with that and you left the country.
Get ready,
book a flight too if you can.
Who knows?
You might have to leave tomorrow night only.
Move away!
What?
I have to clean the dirt!
Oh just shut up!
