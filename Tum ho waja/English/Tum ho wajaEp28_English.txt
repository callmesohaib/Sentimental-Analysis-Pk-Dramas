I want to go! That’s it!
You can’t go!
Why can’t I go! If it was your dad’s funeral instead of mine, what would you have done?
Stop talking nonsense!
Come upstairs! Come! Come!
He slapped her quite hard, didn’t he? Let’s have tea on this happy occasion then.
You are still safe Muraad but think about the day when Babar will get to know the truth,
he will want to kill you. You’ll have to do something..
Babar,
come on son get up.
Be strong.. Be strong okay? Be strong.
Let’s go.
Muraad..
It’s all your fault brother,
if only you hadn’t slapped me then all of this wouldn’t have happened.
Mom, mom wake up. Mom please..
Mom please wake up. Mom, wake up. Mom, look
we just came back from burying dad. Mom wake up.. Mom..
What If mom also just like dad..
No.. Nothing of that sort will happen.
What happened?
Brother, take a look at home. She’s not waking up. Please wake mom up, please..
Nothing has happened, she’s sleeping. She’s resting..
Brother please.. please wake mom up..
What’s wrong Zain? What’s wrong my child? Nothing has happened to mom,
she’s just sleeping. I am telling you, listen to me..
Chanda..
Don’t touch me. Stay away from me..
Chanda..
Do you not understand? Stay away.. stay away from me..
What’s wrong with you?
What’s wrong?
You’re still asking me what’s wrong..
My father died.. My father went away from this world! And you didn’t let me go and see his face!
You are a selfish and apathetic person.
You have no sympathy with me.. You have no humanity in you!
And downstairs, and what about the nonsense you spoke downstairs?
Yes I did talk nonsense,
I defiantly talked nonsense and there was a reason behind that nonsense.
Okay now forget what happened Chanda. Please..
I should forget? All hell has broken loose and you’re asking me to forget everything?
My father left this world and you didn’t even let me see his face!
And you’re asking me to forget about it! How do I forget?
You slapped me right? You raised your hand on me. Is that your humanity?
Instead of taking me to my father you slapped me.
Did you not understand what mama said downstairs?
I understood you, your mother and your father but you’re not understanding!
I didn’t marry you for this.
Did we get married for this? We loved each other, right?
Loving me is another story, you don’t even have any humanity in you,
you didn’t even let me see my father’s face!
My father is gone.. he’s gone..
Dad! Dad.. Don’t touch me!
Chanda..
How is the situation upstairs?
I don’t know.
I didn’t have it in me to go near their room.
Why?
What do you think? Will that girl stay quiet after what all that happened?
And if had gone in the room and if she would have misbehaved with Shebi in front of me
then the situation would have gotten worse.
Listen to me carefully,
the slap she got from Shebi, it didn’t affect her cheek, it affected her heart, directly her heart.
Now slowly and gradually both of them will start disliking each other,
disagreements will start taking place.
The day Shebi gives up, that day will be the last day of that girl in this house and in Shebi’s life.
But I never hit you, you never gave me the chance.
For now sister in law is unconscious,
I don’t know what she will do when she’ll gain consciousness.
Dad, you look worried..
Come.. come..
What’s wrong with you? Are you in your senses?
Keep it here then you can go outside.
Mr. Wajid what was the need for bringing all this?
It’s not about need, it’s about humanity.
When people lose their loved ones they don’t even have any clue about themselves.
Who will cook at home?
Then in such times it’s the responsibility of people like us to take care of them
who we’re related to.
Yes.
Mama!
Mama!
What’s wrong Shebi? Why are you shouting? What’s the problem?
What do I do? I don’t understand anything. Go look at her condition, she’s in so much pain.
Then tell us, what have we done? Is it our fault?
No. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s all my fault!
One minute! What’s the point of talking like this?
What are you two arguing about? I’ll go check on her.
No, there is no need. She’s already very angry.
Then what are you saying? Should we leave her alone?
I think that would be better.
How is that better?
How can we leave her alone in this condition? What if her BP rises or decreases?
Son, she needs to rest right now. I think we should give her a sleeping pill..
What do you mean a sleeping pill?
Your mother is right. She’s in shock right now so if she’ll take a relaxant then she’ll feel better.
Yes son, don’t worry.
Nothing is going to happen to her. I’ll go bring it, I’ll handle everything. You don’t worry.
What’s wrong?
You should be strong Shebi. What’s wrong..
Your mother will take care of it, don’t worry. She’ll handle it.
I have never seen such a exquisite man in my life.
I lost an honest friend.
He used to always be concerned about his children,
he used to take promises from me on various occasions saying
that if anything happens to me Wajid, then take care of my children.
Now is the time to fulfill that promise. Look son, don’t ever think of me as a stranger okay?
Do let me know if anything small or big happens or if there’s some kind of problem at home.
I’ll try my best to take of you all. Okay?
Thank you so much.
What’s there to be thankful for?
This house is like my second home now, I’ll be coming and going.
Of course.
How is aunty feeling now?
You should leave right away.
You shouldn’t be concerned about my mother’s health. Just leave right now.
What’s wrong Sitara? Why are you speaking to me like that?
Be thankful that I’m only talking, technically I should be kicking you out of here.
Sitara, what has happened to you?
What has happened to me?
Do you not remember anything?
You don’t see anything? Such an apathetical behavior?
Why are you showing such an apothecial behavior?
Sitara please talk clearly..
Do you have the courage to listen?
You are the only reason behind this situation of ours. All this has happened because of you.
All this has happened because of me?
Yes.. Why did you leave me those messages when I had already refused to you!
If you hadn’t sent me those messages, dad would’ve never seen them.
He would’ve never gotten furious, and his health would have never been affected.
And he wouldn’t have left us!
He would have been with us now..
Why did you send me those messages?
What was the need for it when I had refused to you? Why..
Sitara, what are you saying?
I have never felt this way.
I have never thought about it then why did you think that I love you?
Why?
Why..
I can never forgive myself.
I’ve started hating myself.. All this has happened because of me..
But remember one thing, I won’t forgive myself but I will also never forgive you. Never..
All the respect I had for you has finished.
You are still standing here.. why aren’t you leaving? What more do you want? Just go..
Dad..
Dad is gone..
I will also die..
I want to go to dad Shahab..
Mom, what is she saying?
Why isn’t she waking up? What kind of things is she saying? Please tell me..
Shebi, let her sleep.
The more she sleeps the sooner she will get better. You come with, eat something.
You go on, I’m coming.
Sit down, sit.
Look Shebi, you are our son, our only son.
You are everything to us wife and husband.
My generation will move forward from your son right?
Yes, I know.
You are worried because of Chanda right?
We are also very worried.
We did everything, we didn’t keep any grudges.. We are only living because of you.
Yes.
Look, the point of speaking on this topic was that
if me and your mother will think of Chanda and your child then
that will only be for their betterment Shebi..
I have hurt you and mama a lot..
No no, you shouldn’t think like that. Why are you saying such a thing?
I was very angry.
I was very angry. I was stern on the fact
that he should come and apologize, it was my right.
The poor guy died.. God forgive me, may he give him heaven’s dew.
Amen. Actually dad, she used to love her dad a lot.
Yes, I know. I know..
My heart melted..
Keeping the rules aside I thought of taking her to her father’s funeral but then
Shebi it occurred to me that what if it affects your child to be somehow..
Look, you have to take good care of Chanda, be strong, with a lot of love.
Yes I know. She’ll start insisting again on going when she’ll wake up..
He’s gone now, he has died who she wanted to meet. What’s the point of meeting anyone now?
I have forgiven the person who has died but not anyone else.
Look Shebi, do remember your promise, no one will go from this house to theirs
nor will anyone come from their house to ours.
Go and check if she has woken up. Go and check son.
You saw my house’s weak walls and tried to damage them too, right?
Why did you leave me those messages when I had already refused to you!
If you hadn’t sent me those messages, dad would’ve never seen them.
He would’ve never gotten furious, and his health would have never been affected.
And he wouldn’t have left us!
Get out! Get out! I say get out of my house!
But, uncle….
Get out!
Uncle, please forgive me.
Mom!
Mom, wake up! Mom, please wake up.
Bhai, why isn’t mom waking up!
Actually, the doctor has given her sleeping pills. That’s why she’s waking up.
Bhai, mom won’t leave us like dad did, right?
No, no, Zain. Why are you saying that?
Nothing like that will happen to mom. She will be fine.
Mom, wake up. Mom, wake up. Please, wake up.
Dad isn’t here anymore, mom. He isn’t here.
Forgive me, Mansoor.
Forgive me.
Bhai had a very big fight with sister in law before he passed away. He felt pain, he fell!
I wish Chanda hadn’t done all of this and your dad would’ve been alive!
Tell me the truth, uncle.
What had happened?
What truth do I tell you?
On dad’s funeral, you were saying that mom and dad had a fight, right? What was it about?
Really? Was I saying that? I don’t remember anything.
It is very evident that you’re hiding something.
No, Babar, my son. Why would I hide anything?
Son, the one who had to leave has left. Forget these things.
The one who left was my father!
This is your chance, Muraad.
Take Babar into confidence and put the entire blame on sister in law or you lose your life.
Tell me, uncle! What are you thinking!
Babar, my son.
You won’t be able to hear it.
And if you hear it, you won’t believe it.
But if you insist, then gather the courage and hear me out.
Son, when I came to your house, Bhai Sahib and sister in law were fighting…. because of Chanda.
Sister in law was very furious. Bhai Sahib was saying to sister in law….
Not saying but begging that she shouldn’t meet Chanda at any cost.
So that whatever little is left of his pride, remains.
But sister in law!
Sister in law was saying that she would bring Chanda back home no matter what.
And son, Shebi’s parents wanted Bhai Sahib to beg in front of them and apologize.
And sister in law was yelling and screaming and forcing Bhai Sahib to do so.
And that’s it. My Bhai and my dad couldn’t bare this insult and he left me!
And Babar,
as far as I am concerned….
I was helpless.
Sister in law had made me helpless about keeping Chanda at my house at any cost.
Babar, son. Your uncle was helpless!
These words of yours, these lies are hurting me. I keep breaking from the inside!
Don’t take any such step that leads me to my grave!
Her education, her going out is all over!
At least you take care of your health….
To hell with my health! Pray that Mansoor dies!
Didn’t I tell you that Chanda was dead for us!
Pull yourself together! Mansoor!
Pull yourself together! Mansoor!
You used to say that he was like a father to you.
Didn’t you feel any shame before raising your hand on your brother?
Excuse me.
Doctor, dad is fine. Right?
Sorry.
Mom, dad is no more! Dad is dead!
Mansoor! Mansoor!
Mansoor! Why isn’t he back yet? Where has he gone? Mansoor.
Mom! What has happened to you? Where are you going!
Mansoor…
Come back to your senses. Come here. Stop it!
Shameless! Shameless human!
What happened!
You!
You raised your hand on your brother!
Mom, what has happened to you? Come back to your senses!
What are you saying, sister in law!
You slapped him and he couldn’t hold himself together!
Sister in law, he was raising his hand on you! All I did was save you!
Liar! Cheap man!
He wasn’t slapping me but you. And you slapped him back in response!
You took his life away!
Mom! Come to your senses!
I won’t spare you!
What are you saying, sister in law?
If you think that my hands have committed this crime.
If you think that I raised these hands on my father like brother then Babar….
I don’t want these hands!
I will cut these hands!
What are you doing! You’re not in your senses right now!
No! Don’t you see that? What is your mom saying!
Look, your uncle can die but he can never raise his hand on his brother!
I know that…
Get out! Get out and go die somewhere!
How can I be alive after you’ve put such a big blame on me! I won’t live! I am going from here!
Uncle, listen to me….
Put such a big blame on me!
Uncle!
Can I kill my brother, after all!
Uncle!
Move away!
Uncle, listen to me…
I say move away! Let me die! Didn’t you hear all what sister in law said about me?
Uncle, you let it go! Let it go!
What must you be thinking! What must you be thinking about your uncle after hearing all this?
I am not thinking anything, uncle!
You also try understanding that she isn’t in the right state of mind right now!
What you’re saying is absolutely right, Babar!
I think that sister in law has made such a big mistake which cannot be undone
and that has affected her mental health.
Didn’t you see? The way she screamed at me when she came outside!
She said so much. So much about me! About me!
You let it go. Leave it…
How should I let it go? She’s my sister in law, equivalent to my mother!
I am the one who lost his brother! That too, forever!
This heart is exploding with pain!
But it’s my helplessness that I can’t leave my sister in law in this condition!
Uncle, you take care of yourself. I’ll handle her.
Yes, Babar! You’re absolutely right.
Your mother needs you the most right now. Go, son! Take care of your mother!
And look, Babar.  Son, the one who had to leave has left. We cannot bring Bhai Sahib back now.
But we have to take care of sister in law.
Uncle, all of that is fine but you….
Son, don’t worry about me.
Your uncle is completely fine. You just take care of your mother! Go!
And listen! If she says anything, you stay quiet!
I will have to make this little snake dance around my fingers.
The way she was saying you raised his hands on him. You took his life away!
She’s going to put the blame on me? I will deal with you, sister in law!
Your aunt has gone crazy. Completely crazy!
What are you saying, dad?
What I’m saying is right. Bhai Sahib’s demise has made her crazy, Danish. Crazy!
No, dad. At least tell me, what did aunt say?
Do you know?
Your aunt came out of the room all of a sudden.
She saw all of us and started yelling and screaming. She started hitting us!
She put the blame on us.
She said that all of us have killed Bhai Sahib together! That we killed Mansoor! All of us!
So then Babar, Zain and Sitara must be very disturbed!
You shouldn’t have left them in such circumstances, dad.
Danish, do you know what happened over there? Your aunt pushed me out of the house!
What? What are you saying, dad? How is that possible?
I am telling you the truth, Danish. I couldn’t believe it either at first.
Although, I wanted to stay with my children.
Danish, it was my duty to stay with my children until they get better!
Oh Allah!
Oh Allah! Give my sister in law the strength to bear with this loss so she stays with her children.
It will take time, dad.
It will take time for her to be okay. Uncle’s sudden demise has shaken everybody.
Son,
I didn’t even have anyone else other than my brother.
Your father only had one brother. I don’t even have anything else!
Pull yourself together, dad. Pull yourself together.
You are the head of this house now.
And how will everything move around if this is how you deal with it?
I’ll do one thing. I’ll go and take care of everything.
No! No, Danish, no!
You won’t go over there right now.
So then will Sitara and Zain look after aunty all by themselves?
The condition that they are in right now, how is Babar going to do everything alone?
You know that my son, Babar?
Allah has given him a lot of strength.
The way he was handling his mother, giving her a shoulder. I could see my brother in Babar.
He told me I shouldn’t worry and let his mother be and that he will take care of everything.
Bhai Sahib was begging that she shouldn’t meet Chanda at any cost.
Sister in law was saying that she would bring Chanda back home no matter what.
I… I had to be buried by his hands but he has left me all by myself! He left me all alone,
Babar! What will I do my entire life?
I wasn’t in my senses.
My mind had gone numb.
I couldn’t even see his face for the last time.
He has left me!
I couldn’t see his face! How unfortunate am I!
You aren’t the one who is unfortunate. It was dad.
The person he loved all his life,
took his life away.
You are the reason for his death. You!
Danish!
Danish!
Sister in law, you?
Come. Sit.
Cowardly, cheap person!
My house got destroyed because of you. Everything is finished!
Sister in law, what are you saying?
I won’t leave you.
I didn’t do anything like that…. Sister in law!
I will kill you.
Sister in law, keep this down! Sister in law! Sister in law!
Go to hell!
