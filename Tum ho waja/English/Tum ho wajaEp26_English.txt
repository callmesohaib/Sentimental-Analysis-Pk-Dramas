She’s sleeping right now..
Go wake her up then..
Dad..
Such a time has come that you’ll lie to your own father.
What do you think? We’re foolish? We don’t understand?
Sorry..
You took her to her house?
No no, we went to Muraad uncle’s, Chanda was getting very worried.
Do we have any value left in your life?
Dad, what are you saying..
I had never thought, I had never thought that my only dear son will disrespect me like this.
I have always put his happiness first, his stubbornness,
I have always done what he wanted in life! No! He didn’t value us! No!
Dad, what has happened..
I am fed up now!
Your dad will listen to nothing.
But mama..
No ifs and buts.
You didn’t value anything we said?
I pray that you don’t have any regrets Shebi.
Mama!
Mama please listen to me!
The father who died listening to taunts because of her,
she didn’t come to see him. I will kill her. I won’t let her live.
No! You won’t do that. You have to stay strong.
Your father left, now you have to become the father for your brother and sisters.
Maybe everything had to happen this way..
Nobody has any control on death.
Accept God’s will.
People will keep on talking,
you just keep your mind and eyes open.
Think hard before making any decision.
Forgive me mom.. I misbehaved so much with you, I hurt you.. Please forgive me..
I promise I will always take care of you.
I will become a good son and show you. I will never leave you alone. Tell me you forgive me.
Mom is in a deep sleep, just try that she doesn’t get disturbed.
And..
I know what you are going through right now
but we are the ones who have to take care of this family now.
Who will take care of mom if you’ll keep crying like this?
Mr. Wajid, Asalam o alikum.
Walikum Salam. How are you?
Absolutely fine. Please come..
Asalam o alikum.
Walikum Salam. How are you Sitara? May god give you all strength and patience.
Amen.
Don’t feel alone, I am with you all.
This is some money, keep it.
No sir, we’re not in need of money at all. We just need your prayers and love.
My prayers and love is with you all but this is Mansoor’s money, I had to give it.
He’s no more but it’s his possession, keep it. Keep it.
Thank you sir. Give it to mom.
Hello?
Yes, alright fine.
Mr. Wajid, a friend of mien is here. He’s at the gate, I’ll be back in two minutes.
I’ll also come..
No no sir, please have tea before going.
Sitara, make tea for Mr. Wajid. I’ll be back in two minutes.
Sitara, look.. don’t worry. I am here for you, if you ever need money, I’ll give it to you. Okay?
If you’re satisfied then send her.
I’ll call her but you’ll have to supervise her until my order gets complete.
Alright, I’ll do it.
I’m leaving then..
You could have at least had tea..
There is no need for tea. I’ll leave, it’s getting very late. You also get there soon.
I’ll leave as soon as Mr. Wajid leaves.
Alright okay.
Where is Sitara..
Where is she..
Here’s your tea uncle..
Thank you so much. Thank you. Where did Sitara go off to?
She’s right there in the kitchen.
Sorry it took more time with the friend.
It’s okay.
Please have tea..
What? A job in Dubai? Oh wow! My fierce son, you made me so happy!
But dad, I won’t go..
What? What did you say?
That I won’t go to Dubai to work.
Have you gone mad? Are you in your senses?
Dad, I am working here already..
Danish, what’s the point of such a job which is only supporting our basic needs?
You’ll have three to four times more salary if you’ll go to Dubai. Both our lives will be set.
Dad, life is set if we live with family
and besides what’s the point of earning money while staying away from family?
Oh please!
Thinking highly of yourself and saying you’re going to take care of people..
Listen to me, a person is respected if he has money, respect is there if you have money.
I don’t need such kind of respect dad.
Danish, why aren’t you understanding?
People work hard for years to go to Dubai, they save and spend money and then go to Dubai.
Fate itself is being kind to my son,
the job opportunity has presented itself and you’re ready to kick it away.
Yes because it’s better than the struggles I’m going to face there.
That means you don’t care about your father?
Dad, I am not going because of you. I want to stay here and take care of everyone.
Don’t talk nonsense! ‘I want to take care of everyone’! Foolish boy!
I’ll look for a nice job and earn a lot of money. You don’t worry
Mom, you’re awake. I’ve brought tea for you..
What time is it?
It’s evening.
It has gotten so late. I didn’t know, I was in a deep sleep.
That’s a good thing then.
Where is Zain?
He’s in the other room.
And Babar?
Mom, eat it. You have to have medicine.
Tell me where Babar is.
He has gone out for work and he gave this money for the house expenses
and Wajid uncle gave this..
What is this?
He said it’s dad’s possession.
Mansoor never mentioned such a thing.
I am here for you, if you ever need money, I’ll give it to you. Okay?
Has something happened? Did Babar say anything?
Nobody has said anything. It’s just Wajid uncle..
What did he say?
Nothing, he didn’t say anything. I don’t like him coming here.
Your designs are very nice but I feel they’re old fashioned.
Designs and trends are changing all over the world. We want our work to show those trends.
Yes.
There is no need to worry. There are some references in here I’ve marked.
Take a look at them and work on them.
Sure. Alright sir.
We should compliment her in front of her but she’s intelligent, she has brains.
All we need to see is how quickly you’ll pick our style.
Yes sir, Inshallah I will try my best.
I’ll go check inside.
What is it Chanda? Why are you bothering me by calling again and again?
Where are you?
I’ve been calling you since so long, you’re not answering, you keep cutting my call.
What has happened?
I have come to see a friend for some work.
Are you okay? Why do you seem upset? Tell me what it is?
Why are you behaving like this?
Everything is fine. What has happened to you? I’ll talk to you once I’m home.
I..
Zain, why are you sitting here alone?
Just like that mom..
Why are you crying?
Nothing mom..
I miss dad..
Look Zain, you’re not supposed to do this. You have to make yourself stronger.
If you’ll do this then who will take care of me?
Who will take of Sitara? Make yourself brave. You won’t cry next time. Promise me
Yes mom.
What are you doing?
I am hungry..
If you were hungry then you could have eaten something else, was it important to eat this?
I felt like eating it.
You felt like it.. Don’t you know that you’re not supposed to eat this in this condition?
I’ve never heard of such a thing.
You would have known if you had gotten good teachings at home.
What do you think? I am asking you not to eat this on purpose?
Mummy, why are you making a big deal out of a small matter?
I am making a big deal out of a small matter?
Do you have any idea what kind of an affect this can have on your baby to be?
If you can’t take care of yourself, at least take care of your baby to be!
Sorry. I made a mistake. I’ll be careful next time.
As if you will.
Just like you’ve been careful about other things.
Father and son are upset with each other because of you.
You are very stubborn Chanda.
I know, I know you oppress Shebi.
Listen to me very carefully Chanda,
this obstinate behavior of yours won’t happen. Do you understand?
Enough is enough.
What is it? You look worried..
I am not worried. I have gotten a job offer from Dubai but I declined it, I won’t go.
Why?
I don’t think it’s appropriate of me to leave you all like this..
You’re thinking is absolutely wrong.
I’ll go check.
Who is it?
Aunty! Aunty! Zain has collapsed outside!
Where? Take me!
Come on! Make space! Hurry! Fast!
Zain! Zain, son…
Mom, one second… water!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes, son!
Open your eyes! Zain! Why isn’t he opening his eyes?
Take him to the hospital! He isn’t coming to his senses!
Let’s go. I’m coming with you!
Mom, you can’t come! You’re in your period of waiting! You’re not supposed to leave the house!
You made this?
Yes.
It’s very nice!
Thank you.
What’s your name?
Erum. My name is Erum.
Erum!
Erum, tell me. What additions can you make in this?
Sir, I was thinking if we could do the same work on its borders
and give this cut to the sleeves then it’ll look better.
That’s a very nice idea! You add these to it and bring it to me.
Sir, if you give me the permission, could I show it to you tomorrow? It’s gotten very late today.
Yes, of course. You go.
Thank you.
Yes, Sitara?
Bhai, Zain’s health is getting really bad. We have brought him to the hospital…
What! What has happened to him?
I don’t know, Bhai. It happened all of a sudden. You please come as soon as possible.
I am coming! I’m coming.
Chanda! Chanda!
What happened? Why did it take you so long to come back…
What happened? Why are you bothering me with your constant calls?
Where were you? I have been waiting for you since so long…
I went out with my friends. Now tell me, what is the problem?
You weren’t home but over here I found out that….
What? What happened?
That…. Mama told me right now
that us going over there has led to you and dad not speaking to each other.
Yes, there had been a problem but I have handled the situation!
Chanda, please! Know one thing.
You won’t be stubborn about meeting your family after today!
This is our life now and this is how we have to spend it
Alright! Look over here. Why are you behaving like this?
I will do as you say. I will listen to everything that you tell me.
Just once. For the last time, listen to me. Please.
Alright, say it.
I want to meet Zain and Sitara for the last time…
What has happened to you! Do you not understand one thing?
Why are you torturing me!
What did you say? I am the one who’s torturing you?
Yes, you are!
I am the one who’s getting tortured, Shahab!
I did not dream of a life like this one!
Some dreams turn into reality and some don’t!
Now this is your life! You have to live in this and die in this too!
It would be better for you if you understand that! Do you understand?
Doctor, what has happened to my brother?
Actually, he has had an appendix problem. We will have to operate him before….
Before what?
If we don’t operate him right now, the poison can spread in the entire body.
No, no! You make the preparations for the operation as soon as possible.
You tell me, what am I supposed to do?
You go and get the file made fast!
Patients name?
Zain. Zain Mansoor.
Sign over here. You will have to deposit 30 percent of the amount right now.
Right now? Right now… Money….
I kept the money that Wajid uncle gave to me this morning.
Alright. You… you go.
The money is here. You please fill out all the other details.
Oh God please save my son
Everything will be fine! All of us are praying
I can't understand, what to do. From where will I arrange the money
Don't worry brother, I will try my best to help you out
Nothing will happen to him! We are praying for him, he will be fine!
Babar.
Assalam o Alaikum.
Walaikum a Salam. How is Zain?
The surgery is going on right now.
Surgery?
What surgery?
Appendix, uncle.
What? How did this happen? He was fine. Then why all of a sudden?
I don’t know, dad.
He went to play outside. He felt some pain and fainted all of a sudden.
His friends told us when they came home.
Alright.
How long has it been since the operation started?
It has taken longer I don’t know why.
Make Allah protect him.
Bhai, go and find out if everything is okay. It has been so long.
Doctor, how is my brother now?
Thank God, the operation has been successful.
Thank God.
Bhai! Got a call from the reception.
Why?
They were saying that we need to deposit 2 and a half lacs as soon as possible.
2 and a half lacs? But they told me that the bill was for eighty thousand?
That is what I said to them too. But they said that this wasn’t a normal surgery.
Due to the appendix bursting, they had to operate a bigger surgery.
ICU bill, medication and everything else combine has cost this much. What will happen now?
Nothing will happen. How can they make such big bill like that?
Two and a half lacs. I’ll go ask them.
Where is mom?
Mom is praying.
And uncle?
He went downstairs.
Alright. Don’t worry. I’ll ask them and come back.
Yes, dad? I am coming. I have picked the cash. I am coming in two minutes. You don’t want it?
Alright, I’m coming. Just two minutes.
I will also come with you.
You cannot go!
I told you, right? I will come with you.
What is it? What’s your problem? Please, try to understand me!
Chanda.
Chanda! Listen to me!
Chanda! Listen to me!
I love you. I don’t want to separate you but it’s important for me to listen to dad otherwise…
Otherwise?
Otherwise what!
Otherwise, it’ll get really difficult!
What difficulty will there be?
Chanda, it is not just about you and me.
We have to think about our unborn child too now! I want to do a lot of things for him.
Please! You will be by my side, right?
Baba is in a campaign right now, I am going with him. We are going together right now.
I will keep calling you. And if I am unable to attend yours, please leave me a message.
Take care of yourself and get ready at night. We’ll go out for dinner.
And yes!
I am sorry for whatever happened yesterday.
Mama and dad must be waiting for you. You go. I will wait for you.
Obviously mom, we cannot fight with them on it. We will have to pay the bill, we cannot go like this.
From where will we arrange this much money?
I don't know, even I am thinking the same...
Uncle
Do you have some money to lend?
No, I don't...
I don't have anything,
honestly speaking I am
feeling very ashamed
of myself for the first time
What sort of uncle am I? I can't do anything for my nephew
Babar, I can arrange upto 50,000 only
If I had some jewelery...
You think that I would have let you sell the jewelery?
We are poor but we are not shameless
I will arrange the money, you just don't
need to worry. I am your elder son, I will do
everything. You stay here, take care of him.
I'll go and make arrangements for the money.
Danish in the meantime you get the money too
Hello?
Yes, Umar?
Really? Yes, alright.
I’ll be there as soon as possible. Yes, yes, as soon as possible. Thank you.
Did you see, uncle?
This is why my heart had been restless since morning.
I could feel that something bad was about to happen, I was feeling anxious
and look it happened!
He is alright, right? Nothing happened to him, right?
Look, my child. I don’t tell you everything that’s going on over here so you get worried.
What are you saying, uncle?
You are the only one who considers me as your own.
Everyone else has distanced from me like I was never related to them?
Uncle, I don’t understand anything! What should I do!
I try to fix everything every time thinking everything will be fine
but everything goes wrong!
My child, there is one way.
What is it?
The hospitals bill over here has become a lot.
My child, if you could somehow arrange one and a half lac….
Then you can win everyone’s heart. Everyone’s.
One and a half lac rupees?
Where will I get so much money from, uncle?
My child, talk to Shebi. If he does something, everything will be fine.
