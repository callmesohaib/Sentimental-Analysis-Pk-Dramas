Asalam o alikum
Walikum Salam.
How come you’re here?
Mr. Wajid, I’ve brought Bhabhi Sahiba’s house papers.
Keep these.
The market value of the house is around 60 to 65 lacs.
Give me the remaining money after what it takes to release Babar,
I’ll give it Bhabhi Sahiba.
What was the need to bring these papers to release Babar?
I would have given the money anyways.
Mr. Wajid, you won my heart.
I’ve started respecting you from my heart.
You’ll do so much for the sake of your friendship with my late brother.
Not only because of the sake of the friendship from your brother
in fact I am doing all this for my love.
I don’t understand Mr Wajid..
I want to marry her and keep her with me in this house forever.
Oh wow.. You’re not just a human, I would say you’re an angel.
You’re supporting the unsupported.
You’re such a great man.
God will reward this deed of yours
but I don’t think sister in law will agree.
Convincing your sister in law will be beneficial for you..
Yes yes. Mr. Wajid, I will try my best
d she might get convinced maybe because of the future of her children
and in order to save them from struggling door to door.
I am only thinking that it’s such a good deed to marry a widow.
Widow?
Yes. It’s obvious that my sister in law is a widow after my brother’s passing.
I want to marry Sitara.
What?
To Sitara?
But..
Mr Wajid,
Sitara is a child..
It’s not like I’m about to die.
. I have a house, a car and a bank balance.
What do I lack?
Of course. All these things are justified but..
But what Mr. Muraad?
What are you thinking about?
Mr. Wajid,
I am thinking if I do all this that you’re asking for then
what will I get in return?
It will also be beneficial for you Mr. Muraad.
Look, I will take up the cost of getting Babar released
and along with that property, these papers, this house can be yours.
The deal isn’t too bad, think about it..
This house, this property can be under your name. Think about it..
Uncle isn’t here yet mom..
He has gone to arrange the money.
I’ve made soup for you, you like it don’t you.
Drink it while it’s hot.
Here you go..
Mom what.. Mom! Mom! What has happened?
I’ve been asking to eat something.
You haven’t eaten anything since morning.
If you don’t feel like eating this then I’ll make something else for you.
I’ll eat something once I’m done praying.
You’re okay right?
Sitara!
Sitara!
Coming uncle!
Yes uncle?
I want to talk to you about something important. Come and sit.
Come.. Come and sit here.
Is everything okay?
Yes.
Look, brother has left this world and Babar is also in prison.
Bhabhi Sahib is also very worried because of Babar.
I am afraid that she won’t be able to endure so much trauma.
What if something happens to her God forbid..
God forbid..
But sitara if you want..
.. I mean to say if Babar comes out then everything will be fine.
You’re right.
Mom is very worried because of this..
But you know that we need 30 to 35 lacs in order to take Babar out of jail.
We haven’t been able to arrange any money uptil now
But Sitara the money could be arranged if you want..
How is that?
You’ll have to sign on the marriage license.
On the marriage license?
Yes.
Sitara, Mr. Wajid’s only condition is that he’ll give the money after marrying you.
What are you saying?
How could you even think of that?
Listen to me..
Even enemies are far more than you. Mom!
Sitara..
Mom!
Uncle.. Tea.. Tea..
Tea..
hmm
Tea..
Okay..
I’ll also make mom have breakfast, she hasn’t eaten anything since yesterday.
I am so worried for her, she won’t eat until I don’t feed her myself.
I have brought tea for you and cake rusk.
You haven’t eaten anything since yesterday.
You won't eat anything, I’ll have to feed you myself.
Come on..
Mom..
Mom..
Mom?
Mom?
Mom..
Mom.. Mom..
Uncle!
Mom! Mom!
Sitara..
I can’t let you go anywhere..
: Mom!
Uncle!
Mom!
What happened?
Uncle, mom!
Sister in law!
Mom! Mom!
Sister in law..
Mom!
Sister in law.. Sister in law..
I can’t let mom go anywhere. What’s wrong with mom..
Sister in law! Nothing has happened to her.
She is only unconscious, she has a pulse.
We’ll take her to the hospital. I’ll go get the car..
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Uncle,
Mom, you’ll see that you’ll be fine soon. You only have to show strength okay?
Mom..
You can't come inside..
She is my mother, at least let me inside..
It’s not allowed to come inside..
Uncle, they’re not letting me go in.
Let the doctors do their work.
We have come to the hospital, Inshallah everything will be fine.
I want to be with mom.. Please..
Don’t worry. Come with me.. Come here.. Come sit here..
What are you doing?
Mom..
You were right when you told me I should control my anger.
I am paying for my anger today!
But what could I have done, mom?
He was taking Erum with him, what could I have done mom?
Just pray for mom.
Yes..
When Zain comes back from school don't tell him that mom’s this unwell.
Let’s see what happens, I am very worried, myself.
Are you with Mrs. Mansoor?
Yes, we’re with her. What has happened to her? Is she fine?
Dr, she had fainted back at the house. Is everything okay now?
Her blood pressure has shot up,
we’re treating her, it’s not getting in control.
Do one thing, get these medicines
and get her file ready at the reception.
Sure.
Dr, mom will be fine right?
Just pray..
Yes mama. I’m leaving from home, I’ll be there in 10 minutes.
Okay.
Your stubbornness
and ego is ruining the both of us.
I have already gotten ruined.
I disobeyed my parents by marrying you.
Disobeyed?
I also disobeyed my parents.
Did I ask you to disobey them?
You married me with your own will
and now suffer the consequences
Go and mend things with them,
no one is stopping you.
What are you doing standing here for?
I will mend things with everyone after mending things with you
Don’t go along with this marriage, don’t.
Why don’t you look at me? Please look at me.
. I am saying something to you.. Don’t go along with this marriage, don’t.
look
Your eyes are screaming of sadness
and happiness?
That is not visible in your eyes
Then look into my eyes, look at your own face in these eyes.
All you’ll see is a killer and nothing else.
How is mom feeling now?
Thank god her blood pressure is normal now, we are shifting her to the ward.
Can I meet her now?
Yes, of course you can go.
Thank you..
Mom..
are you feeling better now?
What had happened to me?
It was nothing serious, you only had high blood pressure.
Zain.. Where’s Zain?
He has come back from school, he is with bhabhi.
Don’t tell Babar that I am here..
You are not allowed to talk much..
You have to rest.
They’ll shift you to the ward in a while.
I spoke to the doctor,
she said there is nothing to worry about.
Yes, Murad! Assalam o Alaikum.
Wajid Sahib, it’s me Murad.
What’s the update on my work?
Wajid Sahib, your task isn’t as easy as you think it is.
And there has come a new problem over here!
What happened now?
Bhabi Sahiba fell ill all of a sudden.
Her blood pressure shot up. She became unconscious.
I have brought her to the hospital!
Hello? Wajid Sahib?
This means that she is also about to go. Won’t that make our work easier
You’re mistaken, Wajid Sahib! This task is extremely difficult!
I’ll do something. I’ll come to the hospital and that way I can meet Sitara…
No, no!
Wajid Sahib, what are you saying? There’s no need for you to come here.
I will inform you myself as soon as your work is done.
At least hear me out…
Alright, Murad. As you wish.
The marriage contract is extremely important!
: I can’t see mom in this condition!
She’s stressed because of Bhai.
Sitara, control yourself.
Tayi Jaan will lose whatever little hope she has left if you’re going to cry like this.
What if Bhai doesn’t come back?
What’s going to happen then?
Danish…
My child, I’m trying so hard.
I’m trying so hard to make you strong.
I’m spending all my time here.
For who, my child? For you guys!
And these tears of yours, Sitara. They’re making me weak.
For god sake, be there for me.
Be strong and stay by my side.
Yes, Danish?
Assalam o Alaikum, dad?
I’m really worried after hearing about Tayi Jaan.
Look, my child.
You being upset is not going to do any good to your Tayi Jaan or you.
You just pray that Allah Almighty takes us out of this trial as soon as possible.
Dad, I have full faith in you.
But you just somehow get Babar Bhai released.
Son, I’m trying my best. Babar will come out in a couple of days.
Sister in law is also stable now.
The doctors have said that she will be discharged tomorrow.
Alright, dad.
I’m sending you some money, you make sure you get them.
Oh no, son! What are you saying?
It’s not like I’m going to leave anything. She’s my sister in law!
Alright, dad. Allah Hafiz.
Khuda hafiz
What was the need for you to bother him abroad?
I felt very restless. I’m sorry.
Take this.
Open your eyes now.
So? How do you like your new house?
You can’t do this!
How can someone else take my place?
No!
You can’t do this!
You can’t do this! You can’t do this!
No one can take my place! No one can take my place! No one!
Doctor,
can I take my patient home?
What are you saying?
You should be grateful that she didn’t suffer from brain hemorrhage!
She’s in a very critical condition!
Yes, thank god for that.
Actually doctor, the thing is that she’s my sister in law and she’s a widow
so all the responsibilities are on my shoulders and I am a very simple man.
I won’t be able to afford the bills for this big hospital of yours.
: I’ll try and find out if there’s any way I can get you help from the charity fund.
You will have to sign a few papers for that.
You can come with me.
I’ll come.
Come! Sarfaraz….
Come.
Oh my god! This… What is all this?
Shamim!
Shamim! Did you die or what! Who did this!
Who is it that had the guts to ruin the room like this?
Oh my! This… Who could do all this?
Shamim!
I’m the one who did all of this!
I did all of this.
How dare….
Enough!
Move away.
Move away.
And you?
What do you think?
You can take my place in this house?
Get out. Get out of here!
What’s going on?
I can tolerate anything but I won’t tolerate her in this house!
Have you gone mad?
Go away from here! Yes, I have gone mad!
Do you know who you’re talking to?
This is my mother and she’s my wife!
I can tolerate everything. Didn’t I say that? But I won’t tolerate her.
I am going to kill her!
You have gone mad and nothing else!
I’ll kill her!
Aunty,
you said that this girl’s worth in this house was just that of a maid?
Then what the hell is this?
You guys do one thing. Go and sit in the lounge.
Shebi? You take Sana downstairs. I’ll deal with her.
You can’t go anywhere!
Get out!
She won’t go! She won’t go! Let go of me! Leave me!
Sit comfortably. We’re just coming, alright?
You put out a knife?
On me?
On my family members?
You embarrassed us in front of Sana?
You did the right thing. You’re the one who’s going to fix this now!
I’m sitting here. Right in front of you. Come on!
Why are you standing? Start cleaning!
Why did you guys do this to me?
Didn’t you feel any pity?
How cruel are you guys!
You poisoned your son so much that he turned against me and got married?
Don’t you feel any pity for me?
We did pity you! We pitied you!
We felt sorry for you and that’s why we told your mother to refuse this proposal!
But no! She didn’t refuse!
You’re paying for her deeds today!
What? What did you just say?
Mom wasn’t the one who refused?
In fact, you guys are the ones who forced her to…
Yes, yes! What else could we have done?
Brought someone like you in the house?
Why would we become bad in our only son Shebi’s eyes?
By saying that we don’t accept you?
Yours and Shebi’s marriage ruined the entire plan!
Your brother came over? That goon?
We insulted and kicked him out!
And then your mother comes. Accept my daughter!
Don’t let my husband find out!
We reminded her of her worth!
We kicked her out!
We made each and every member understand that we don’t accept you!
We don’t accept you!
But no!
You guys didn’t understand so now pay for it!
Pay for it!
Such an important day of my life,
the day I have been waiting for my whole life!
That Chanda ruined everything!
Shahab? Are you stressed out?
Actually, the situation is such.
You must be worried but don’t worry…
I’m sorry.
Actually, I have a really bad headache.
I don’t know why…
Lean back, I’ll press it…
No, no.
It’s okay.
It happens with me sometimes…
When I’m stressed out.
I’ll be fine if I go to sleep.
Yes.
I’ll sleep in the guest room today.
Sana, I’m sorry.
I don’t know why…
a lot happened today. Didn’t you see the scene she created?
I am really stressed.
I just hope you understand.
I do understand. Don’t worry.
Thank you.
Shahab!
Sleep over here.
It won’t look nice if you go out.
And I’m absolutely fine, don’t worry.
All of fifteen thousand. The work should be done now.
Keep it, I’ll explain everything to you.
Mom isn’t well.
They’ve shifted her to the ward.
Has Zain reached?
Please give him food.
Sitara, my child. I spoke to the doctor.
She’s saying that Bhabhi Sahiba’s condition isn’t getting stable
so there’s a possibility that she might have to stay here for a week or two.
My child, this is such an expensive hospital and I don’t have any…. So I filled the charity fund…
Charity fund?
My child, we are helpless.
It’s about your mom’s health and life. You just pray that they…
It’s about your mom’s health and life. You just pray that they…
Yes. Is it approved?
Yes.
Please sign over here.
Do I sign or does her actual daughter sign?
The daughter.
The daughter.
What’s happening? What’s written in it?
This an application for the hospital. I have read it, my child. You read it too.
Yes, yes. Read it fast and please sign on it.
You read it
The patient’s blood pressure is shooting up a lot. You go inside, I’ll call the doctor.
Uncle…
You please sign fast.
Yes, yes
Give it to me.
Over here. My child, here.
My child, here.
Here you go.
Oh! Wow, wow, wow!
This means that Sitara is now my legal wife?
Definitely.
Congratulations!
Many congratulations.
Thank you. You just tell me this right now.
These signatures that are done on these papers, did Sitara sign them happily or ….
Forget about it, Wajid Sahib.
Happily or sadly, what difference does that make?
You tell me, what’s up with my work?
To get Babar released….
No, no, no! No! Don’t let Babar go until that house is in my name.
It’ll be done.
It will be done and it will be done very soon.
You just give this marriage contract…
What do you do?
I’m not a weak player either.
I’ll take something from one hand while I give you this from the other.
My daughter is not an orphan
Come lets go Chanda
