He cut my call!
I’ll leave him a message. 
I’m at the assemblage, I’ll talk to you later.
Oh God! What should I do?
Yes, dad? I am coming. I have picked the cash.
You don’t want it anymore? I am coming in two minutes.
Assalam o Alaikum!
How are you?
I got the money.
I don’t know how to thank you.
Yes, I am going to the hospital only. 
Come directly over there.
Done, done, done.
We’ll meet over there.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Khuda Hafiz! 
Wait, wait, wait! Stop the bike, you!
Take out your wallet!
Take out your mobile, fast! 
One minute.. I am giving it..
Take out your wallet! Take out your wallet! Fast!
What is this that you’re hiding? Take it out!
It’s nothing…
Take it out!
It’s nothing..
Take it out!
Let this be. This is money for my brother’s treatment! 
Let’s go! Let’s go!
Please! I need this money very urgently, it’s for my brother’s treatment!
Is everything okay? What are you doing here?
Brother isn’t picking up the phone. His phone is going off. He hasn’t come yet! 
Don’t worry, he’ll be here. I have brought 40 thousand rupees, I am going to get it deposited.
As soon as he comes, send him to me.
Why has she come here?
What has happened to Zain?
Is he feeling alright? 
Who told you?
Uncle called me and told me.
Where is he? I want to meet him. 
You can’t meet him
and neither are you allowed to see him. 
Why? 
Because I’m telling you. That’s why.
Alright! Don’t tell me.
I will go and find out myself!
There’s no need for you to cause a scene over here.
You have already caused a lot of drama in our lives.
Neither will I let you cause a scene now nor will I let you meet Zain! 
One minute. One minute. One minute.
Who are you to stop me?
He’s my brother!
I have all the rights! 
I also have my rights on him! 
You have lost all your rights because of your mistakes! 
Make her understand! 
Sitara is absolutely right. 
Oh! You too?
I have no interest in talking to you guys.
Call mom. I want to talk to her. 
You can’t talk to mom either
and you also can’t meet her.
Say whatever you have to say to me or go away from here! 
There’s no need for you to get so hyper!
You guys need money right now. I came to give you that!
Call mom! Don’t you understand this? 
Really? You’ll give us the money and win our hearts back?
What do you think you’ll give us your money and we’ll forgive all your mistakes and all your sins? 
We aren’t greedy for money!
You were the one who was greedy for money because of whom all of this has happened! 
Now you keep this money saved! You will have the money but you won’t have us! 
Sitara! 
You’ve started to talkback now.
I am only talking for now, I also know how to raise my hand and now,
I won’t show any consideration anymore.
The path of life that you have chosen for yourself, keep walking on that.
And for god sake, don’t show us your face! Go from here!
Fine. That’s fine. I will remember what you did today for the rest of my life.
I will always remember..
Bhai! Got a call from the reception.
They were saying that we need to deposit 2 and a half lacs as soon as possible..
If I had any jewelry..
What kind of an uncle am I? I don’t have money for my blood, my nephew..
Babar, don’t worry..
Everything else combine has cost this much. What will happen now?
What does Sitara think of herself?
She didn’t even let me meet Zain.
God knows in what condition the poor thing must be in, how he must be feeling..
I’ll call uncle..
Chanda.. You wretched woman, you should have called before coming here.
She ruined everything!
He cut my call..
He switched off his phone..
Please relax Sitara in fact have water..
My brother shouldn’t find out that Chanda came here..
What happened? Why are you two standing here?
Dad, did you tell Chanda about what happened?
What? Chanda came here?
When you knew it wasn’t appropriate for her to come here then why did you tell her?
Why are you repeating Chanda Chanda again and again?
I didn’t call her here on purpose.
She called me herself, so we were talking and I told her.
if she came here then how is it my fault?
I don’t understand why every good deed of mine backfires.
What happened? What is it?
What do I tell you..
Actually we were talking about Babar, he hasn’t reached yet.
Call him, try to find out.
I did, his phone is switched off.
It’s off..
Please don’t worry, he’ll come soon.
Danish, you went to get the money..
Yes dad, here’s the money.
Good boy!
Let’s go and get it deposited.
I’ll come along. You go sit with Zain. If Babar comes, send him to us.
Please come..
Babar.. Please go back!
Yes, right here.
One minute..
Babar sir, why are you sitting here like this?
I’ll tell you everything. Please give me your phone, I have to make an important call.
My phone got switched off because the battery got low.
What has happened? Umer sir was telling me your brother is hospitalized.
My brother is in the hospital.
I had arranged the money with a lot of difficulty for his treatment
but they got snatched from me.
I don’t know how will he get his treatment done.. How will I return that money..
I don’t know what to do..
Babar sir, don’t worry. The money will get arranged.
How?
Mam this is a private hospital, I can’t do anything about it.
You’ll have to pay the money no matter what.
You guys are creating such a big issue!
When we are telling you that the money will get deposited then it will!
Danish, is this how you’re supposed to talk?
Move, move away. I’ll speak to him.
I apologies, he’s a child.
Look, my nephew is admitted here. It’s not like we’ll run away.
Please take this money, we’ll deposit the remaining money as well.
Asalam o alikum sir.
Talk to him, he’s our head of finance, he can help you out.
Alright.
Asalam o alikum sir.
Walikum Salam.
This is my sister in law, she’s a widow so we’re having some money problems.
We had deposited 30 thousand rupees, we want to deposit 50 thousand more.
We’ll deposit the rest of the money in a while also, my nephew has gone to get the money.
Till when will you get it deposited? How much time will it take?
We’ll need some time. It will only take a few hours. We’ll be very thankful to you.
Alright. Sign the undertaking. Get it signed from them.
Yes sir.
If you don’t get the money deposited on time
then the hospital administration can take a legal action against you.
What kind of legal action?
Our board takes the decision for that.
Asalam o alikum.
Shebi, you were getting worried for nothing. Chanda’s back..
Walikum Salam..
Where did you go?
Actually.. Shahab.. I went to the hospital, Zain wasn’t well…
I had asked you not to go but you still went?
You did ask me not to go but I had to go.
Uncle kept calling, Zain was really not well and they needed money so..
Money?
Chanda, show me your bag..
No! No! Mama..
Show it to me for one second.. What’s the problem in showing it to me..
Let me see!
So much money..
Shebi, you must have given them to her right?
Her uncle must have given her the money, right? Your uncle gave them to you?
Tell me, give me an answer. Where did this money come from?
I took it from the money you kept in the drawer..
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
You stole?
I didn’t steal.
Didn’t you feel ashamed?
You stole from your own house?
What’s wrong with you? Who steals from their own house?
If you needed the money, you could have asked me, I would have given it to you.
Why are you accusing me off stealing?
I am telling you I didn’t steal! Why will I steal?
Behave yourself! Look at the way you’re speaking to mama.
You talk to me softly. Is this the way to talk in front of everyone?
Didn’t you feel ashamed you stole from your own house, from your own husband?
What’s wrong with you? Who steals from their own husband?
They money was there so I took it, that isn’t stealing!
I didn’t steal! Why don’t you understand?
That money wasn’t mine, it was dad’s, he had given them to me for some work!
Be quiet now! Enough! Enough. Enough of this drama now. Nobody will speak now.
Look, she has no respect for us, she also has no respect for you.
She will keep meeting them even if you keep stopping her.
She will go, she can’t leave her family but she can leave this family though.
Enough of this now. You two make arrangements for yourself now.
Enough of this now. You two make arrangements for yourself now.
Come with me.
Where are you taking me? Leave me.
Shebi..
Such a fire has been sparked now that he won’t keep her here anymore.
Stealing? You should get an Oscar for that.
Sitara, try one more time.
He might have switched on his phone.
If we don’t deposit the money on time then what will happen?
I think if we don’t deposit the money on time then they might stop Zain’s treatment
and I don’t know how the hospital administration takes legal actions, god knows what…
It’s all for money. Money makes the mare go.
Money is very important.
If I was earning well then I wouldn’t have let anyone getting worried.
I’ll go to Dubai, I’ll earn a lot of money.
Come here!
I can’t face my parents because of you!
When I had asked you not to meet your family then why did you go?
And you also stole!
I didn’t steal because I would have never brought back the money!
Keep your voice down!
Already such a huge scene was caused because of you!
And taking money without permission is called stealing!
I did call you, you didn’t pick up my call!
I had told you in the morning so why can’t you understand?
Why do you not understand? He’s my brother! He wasn’t well!
If you cared so much about his condition
then why didn’t you feel sorry for him when you ran away to get married with me!
I was mad! I was mad! I had lost it! I regret it!
I am only regretting the fact that I married you!
You’re regretting?
Leave me!
You will start regretting now. You will get to know when I’ll teach you a lesson!
Stay in this room now!
So what happened?
Did they agree?
No aunty. They’re not ready to give us more time
Did you find out anything about Babar?
I can’t seem to find out about Babar also, his phone is switched off.
Umer, this is Babar’s mom speaking. Where is Babar?
No, he hasn’t reached here yet.
I hope he’s not in some kind of trouble.
Let me know as soon as you find out.
Aunty, what is Umer saying?
I don’t know how to get out of this problem.
One child of mine is sick and the other one is stuck god knows where..
Aunty, don’t worry.
Everything will be fine. I’ll go get water for you.
I don’t understand these hospital people. They’ve created such a problem for us.
God knows where our poor Babar must be roaming helplessly around for the money.
Bhabhi Jee, believe me.
You only have one way out of this.
What?
We aren’t sure whether Babar would bring all of the amount or not.
You… ask Wajid Sahib for the money.
Never!
Bhabhi Sahiba, if you have any other way then tell me.
I won’t ask Wajid for money!
I have dialed his number. You talk to him.
Bhabhi Sahiba, it is very important.
Wajid Sahib has picked up the phone. You talk to him.
Hello. Assalam o Alaikum, Bhai Sahib. It’s me, Sahiba speaking.
Bhabhi, you? Is everything alright?
Nothing is fine!
Why, what happened?
Zain wasn’t feeling well so we brought him to the hospital.
The doctor said he needs to be operated as soon as possible!
Oh, alright…
The operation is done but…
Babar has gone to arrange the money but we haven’t been able to find anything out about it!
Alright. I’ll come.
Thank you very much!
The path of life that you have chosen for yourself, keep walking on that.
And for god sake, don’t show us your face!
If you cared so much about his condition
then why didn’t you feel sorry for him when you ran away to get married with me!
Look at him yourself! The condition that my son is in!
Nothing. Nothing has happened to my son.
He’s going through a difficulty in life.
He’ll face it like a man! He’s my lion. Lion! Yeah?
Do one thing. Get up! Let’s go out for a walk, let’s go have a meeting or two!
Come on!
Come, my lion.
Wajid Sahib, I don’t know how to thank you.
If you hadn’t given this money then….
Look, I don’t just have business relations with Mansoor but he is like a brother to me.
I could help his family in some way. What’s a bigger happiness than that?
Ma Sha Allah! This is your greatness otherwise who does that in times like these?
Alright. Let these talks be. Tell me, where is Babar? I don’t see him anywhere.
Where would that poor kid go? He had also just went to make arrangements for the money.
Mom!
Zain is calling you inside.
You go inside, I’ll come.
Bhai Sahib, I wanted to thank you once again.
If you’re going to keep thanking me again and again like this, you’ll embarrass me.
Anyway, I’ll get going now. If you need anything at all, let me know. Alright?
Come. I’ll walk you out.
Where has he gone!
Will the matter get solved if he doesn’t talk to me?
Chanda!
The girl won’t leave him easily!
Hello! Where are you?
Shebi’s father speaking!
Uncle, connect me with Shahab!
He cannot talk right now, he’s busy.
I have to talk to him about something very important!
Can you please connect me with him?
The son and father are out for a ride.
Can’t you see them happy? Don’t call again and again. Do you understand?
You listen to me….
Hello?
You’re back, my son?
Yes, dad.
Alright! After the meeting, we both father and son will go out for lunch.
Dad…
Oh, nothing! Everything will be fine! Let’s go!
Dad, you go and rest at home. We are here, we’ll take care of everything.
Uncle! I have arranged the money! Come, let’s get the money deposited…
The money has been arranged, Babar Bhai. You don’t get worried.
The money has been deposited? What do you mean?
I did whatever I could from my side.
Where were you!
I’ll tell you that later. You tell me, where did the money come from?
Abu’s friend, Wajid Sahib gave it.
You took money from Wajid Sahib?
Why did you take money from Wajid Sahib when I had told you I would arrange it?
Don’t you trust me?
I do trust you but…
But what? How long did I take to return that you guys couldn’t wait for me?
Babar bhai, everything is in front of you.
There had come so many difficulties over here that Aunt didn’t even have any other solution either.
Yes.
And Babar, if Bhabhi Jee hadn’t called Wajid Sahib
then this hospital’s staff would’ve left our Zain’s operation in the middle and kicked us out.
And you tell me yourself, how long would we have waited for you?
Till the time I hadn’t come back! Till then!
Look at this. There’s money in my hands!
And you think of it yourself, dad never asked for money favors from Wajid Sahib in all his life.
What must Wajid Sahib be thinking?
That a dignified man like dad has such an irresponsible son?
Babar! Babar. Money can be returned but if god forbid, something had happened to Zain…
You’re forgetting that Zain is also my younger brother and I had taken full responsibility of him.
The thing is that uncle, on my way to the hospital, snatcher’s looted me.
Even then, I arranged this amount again!
What?
Nothing has happened to you, right?
No need to worry too much about me because in reality, you don’t! Tell me, where is Zain?
In the room...
Sitara?
How is he?
How is my brother feeling?
Bhai, I am fine.
Dad came in my dream.
He was very tensed.
He also kept loving me again and again.
He was saying to me that in place of him, you’re my father now.
You won’t leave us, right?
What are you saying, Zain?
Dad has left but I am here in his place. I will never leave you.
Bhai, I won’t die. Right?
What’s has happened to you, Zain?
You’re my champ! Nothing will happen to you.
Come on now. Don’t think too much. Take a rest.
Where were you?
I went to arrange the money.
Don’t they say that when the time is bad for you, nothing goes right?
That’s what happened.
On my way back, snatcher’s looted me on gun point.
What would I have done?
I had to bring the money.
Then the same helplessness.
I did arrange the money again but….
I don’t know when my bad time will end.
Chanda Aapi had come.
Why? Why did she come here now?
To buy our helplessness with her money. She came to give money.
Who called her here? Mom?
No, not mom. She was saying that uncle called and told her.
This uncle!
Already, he made mom call Wajid Sahib and got him to deposit the money over here!
We have been shamed in front of the world.
We have to lower our gaze before people because of Chanda.
Other times, for the need of money, we have to put our hands forward in front of everyone
You return this money to Wajid Sahib tomorrow only.
You know? If dad had been alive right now,
he would’ve felt a lot of pride in seeing you so strong like this.
And to tell you the truth,
for the first time today, you have said something dad would’ve.
It feels like it’s not you talking but dad.
This same way, keep supporting me, Sitara.
We’ll return him his money tomorrow only!
We must keep whatever remaining respect we have, intact.
Did you eat something?
I don’t feel hungry.
Listen, I’ll go get something for you.
I don’t want to eat.
I’ll send it.
It’s been all night and this man hasn’t come home even now?
How heartless is this person?
He doesn’t care about me.
Why is he doing this to me?
Shameem!
Shameem!
Yes?
Where is Shahab?
I don’t know.
I feel hungry, make me breakfast.
I was going to iron Bibi Jee’s clothes…
Clothes can be ironed later too! You make me breakfast.
I have a lot of work! If you’re in such a rush, make it yourself…
Oh, oh, oh…
What are you saying?
What has happened? Why are you making this noise?
She’s arguing with me for no reason!
She was asking me to make breakfast.
All I said was that I have to iron your clothes. And then…
What wrong did she say? Whose orders is she going to listen to if not mine?
One minute. You’re insulting me in front of this maid?
It’s only right. You should do your work on your own.
How long are you going to stay in your room for? Now, enough!
So that means there’s importance for this maid in this house and not me!
This maid gets paid more than your father used to earn in a month!
Don’t bring my father into this!
Keep your volume down!
And don’t ever speak to me in this tone again!
And now, you will look after the kitchen!
I won’t!
You will have to.
Are you giving me a threat or an order?
Whatever you want it to be.
Alright.
So, why don’t you explain all of this to me in front of Shahab?
Do one thing, you explain all of this to Shahab.
And yes! Don’t forget to tell him that I am the one who has said all of this. Okay?
Go. Iron the clothes.
