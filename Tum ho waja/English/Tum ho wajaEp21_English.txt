The way Chanda died for me, you have too.
Now get out of my house before I end up doing something wrong.
I could have never imagined that I would be alive to see this day.
After Mansoor left I had thought that my children would become my support.
I have realised today that I am unsupported.
But I still pray
and hope that your children never treat you the way you have treated your mother,
that  your children don’t abandon you the way you have abandoned your own siblings.
Let;s go, I feel suffocated here.
Babar..
You are not in the condition to think rationally right now,
cool down your mind.
I’ll come some other time.
Listen..
What has happened?
She is here..
Who has come, tell me?
Sana is here.
Sana?
Let’s go already..
You.
Why have you come here?
What is it to you?
What is it to me?
Understand something very clearly, if you have come here to marry Shahab then..
Go work in kitchen. Go go..
Hello uncle. How are you?
Hello..
Hi aunty. Hope all’s well.
Sana, why you come?
Well,I have come here to let you guys know that I have made my decision.
I have decided..
Decision? What kind of decision dear?
That I want to marry Sahab.
I want to get married but within this week..
Ikram..
Oh please uncle,  don't worry about dad.
I have discussed everything with him.
You guys just decide the date then.
Very good..
Very good..
Everything else is taken care of.
You sit. Tea, coffee, toffee..
No uncle,  I should get going.
But I see you guys soon right? Bye!
inside girl! Go go! Bye..
Bye..
Bye..
What were you talking about?
What were you asking her?
I had asked you not to say anything.
Do you not understand English?
Go inside! Go!
How are you?
Look at what brother did to us?
And you blessed him with your prayers?
How could I have cursed him? He’s my son.
Then what are we to you?
You care about the son who threw you out of the house
and the daughter who ran away from the house
but you don’t care about us, me and Zain?
All my children are equal for me.
If we are equal then why don't you think about us?
Brother and his two faced of a wife are having fun at home
and we are wandering door to door.
How is that fair?
Then what do I do?
That house is in your name.
So?
So tell brother that house is yours, he can take his wife wherever he wants to.
So I should evict him?
Yes, you should evict him.
if he doesn't care about you then he also has no right to stay in that house mom.
Since when did you start talking big?
I will absolutely not do that.
Mom, we all have a right to that house.
. If anybody has an issue they can make arrangements for themselves.
Why should we wander around..
Sitara is absolutely right.
That house only isn’t Babar’s, these children also have the right to it.
How can you deprive them of their right?
How can I let my family scatter over such a small matter
You think this is a small matter mom?
He has acted arbitrarily after dad left,
he even threw us out of the house.
Our family isn’t a family anymore, it has scattered away.
All there is left is the structure of a house on which we all have a right on.
Whatever it may be,
he is my son after all. How can I do that to him?
Am I not your son?
Zain, what are you talking about?
Of course you’re my son.
How could you think like that?
Oh my, look who's all grown up.
Now is your chance, don’t let this opportunity pass Muraad.
Look, I’m not in the favor of allotment,
not at all but these children shouldn’t be deprived of their right.
The rest is up to you.
God bless you.
what are you thinking about?
Here, have tea..
What has happened?
Nothing..
There was a thought wandering in my mind,
that how must an orphan’s life be like..
Babar, why are you saying such things?
You have also lived such a life.
What does it feel like?
I want to know..
What do I tell you..
I was very young when my father passed away
then my mother gave me the love of both father and a mother,
when I became a teenager my mother also passed away
after that my life became a curse.
If mom would have been alive today then
I wouldn’t have been wandering door to door.
Even if my wedding wouldn’t have been a grand event but
there would still have been henna on my hands.
Even today I feel mom’s absence..
Look at me, I’m so unfortunate.
so unfortunate that my mother is alive
but I deprived myself from her shadow.
Babar, why do you blame yourself?
Because I am to be blamed.
What I did was very wrong, I misbehaved with them.
I should have apologized but I..
Nothing will get fixed if you apologize in fact it will get much worse.
Today Sitara talked back to you.
Tomorrow, Chanda might also come and start questioning you.
It’s good,
I agree that you've realised your mistake but remember that it takes two to tango.
Some might find it right and some might find it wrong
but I think whatever you did was absolutely right.
But they’re all alone..
How can I let them stay somewhere else..
Babar, when did I ask you to leave them?
All I am asking is for you to be patient for a few days.
After your father you are the householder of this house,
you are our guardian.
Mom, Zain, Sitara and Chanda,
it’s everyone’s duty to listen to you and abide by it as well.
If that doesn't happen then no one will respect you.
Today, Sitara talked back to you,
, If this keeps going on
then Zain will also stand against you and say whatever he feels like.
Babar, I am saying all this because I want what's better for this family,
, I want to maintain your respect and I am with you.
I think it's Danish calling..
Hello?
Yes dad, can you hear me?
Yes Danish! Can you hear me?
Asalam o alikum.
Walikum Asalam. How are you?
I am absolutely fine dad. How are you?
I am doing good by the grace of God. You told me that you’ll call once you’ll reach.
Sorry dad I got a little busy that's why I couldn't call but I did leave you a message.
I was just worried about you..
Tell me how is aunty doing?
Did Sitara not call you?
No? Is everything okay?
What do I tell you Danish..
Babar has thrown everyone out of the house.
Okay..
And now everyone is here with me.
I don't know what has happened to Babar brother,
he has become an enemy to his own family.
What do I say son..  I am doing whatever I can.
Dad please take good care of aunty, Zain and Sitara and make them feel at home.
I'll try my best son.
Danish, you know that besides God you are the only support I have.
I used to manage somehow when I was alone
but now I have guests at home..
Don't worry dad, everything will be fine.
Inshallah. Khuda hafiz.
Make sure to call me.
Alright dad, Khuda hafiz.
Khuda hafiz.
Thank God, Danish reached Dubai.
What do you want? What do you want… that I leave you at the door myself or
that I push these two out of here?
Because I am a bad person anyway.
I will always be the bad guy in your eyes, no matter how much truth I speak.
Mom, we all have a right to that house.
If anybody has an issue they can make arrangements for themselves.
Why should we wander around..
All my children scattered away.
My family got destroyed, everything got destroyed.
I never caused anyone any harm intentionally,
never wished anything bad upon anyone
then why did this happen to me?
Then why am I living in somebody else’s home?
If I’ve made a mistake unintentionally then forgive me God.
Oh god, show me a way..
I’ll have to be strong.
I can’t give up so easily
otherwise what will become of these two?
Oh God, help me..
Why did you go?
You were the only one who I could share everything with.
. I have become all alone without you.
Come back.
Please.
Come back soon..
Shahab, I hope you understand that this is a very big decision for me
in fact papa is very unsure and I..
Shahab?
I hope you’re not doing all this to take revenge from Chanda?
Sana, nobody is forcing you
and I can’t give answers to so many questions.
Now you know the situation, the rest is up to you.
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Have some sweet, come on..
Ghafoor and Ikram have fixed your marriage, the date has been decided.
The engagement is tomorrow and the marriage ceremony is the day after tomorrow.
You should go and buy a nice dress now. Take her shopping.
Why are you standing like that Shahab? Have some sweets..
Aunty,
I’ll make Shahab eat it.
Shahab..
Here you go, have some sweets.
Eat it! Shameem! Shameem!
Come on..
Aunty is right. We must go for shopping now. Yeah?
Let’s go! What are you waiting for?
What are you doing, Murad?
Actually sister in law… I was just checking the ration.
Everything Is finished.
. I used to live alone before. I used to go to sleep hungry too sometimes.
Now the kids are over, that’s why I was getting worried.
Take this.
Whatever ration you can buy from this, get it.
Oh! No, no, sister in law. I can’t take this. I can’t take this at any cost.
Keep it. The kids won’t find out.
Go and get the ration.
You’ve provided a roof over our heads.
Is this favor of yours any less?
No, sister in law. How is this a favor? This is your own house.
I’ll go get the ration.
Mom!
How long is this going to go on for?
What are you trying to say?
I heard everything.
Why don’t you talk to Bhai? He’s sitting peacefully over there!
And we’re depending on uncles’ favors.
Have you thought of a permanent solution for this?
You don’t worry. In Sha Allah, everything will be fine.
Whose help are you waiting for?
: I have full faith in my blood.
You’ll see.
Babar will come and take us home very soon.
You’re mistaken.
You have forgotten that before being your son, he’s somebody else’s husband now.
He won’t ever come here while she’s there.
Babar!
Oh.
Wake up, I’m serving the food. Come.
Wait. I don’t want to eat. I don’t feel like it.
. I’ve been sitting at home since so many days… I’m sick of it.
I can’t figure out anything about work and business
and there’s still twenty more days till I get the keys to the shop.
Alright. Get up and sit.
Will all the worries go away if you don’t get up and don’t eat food?
What else am I supposed to do other than staying upset?
I thought I would call Umer and maybe he can help me out.
So then what did he say?
What would he say?
He didn’t hear my calls.
In fact, he didn’t even respond to my messages.
What have you gotten yourself into?
Just directly call Wajid Uncle.
Didn’t he say that he would help you?
I am thinking about it. I don’t have any other option except for Wajid Sahib.
Erum! What happened? What happened? Sit!
Nothing. It’s just…. I got a little dizzy all of a sudden.
Dizzy? You’re facing weakness! You haven’t even eaten anything….
I hope you aren’t stressing about my work, right?
Don’t worry. I am fine.
You just be fine. I… I really need your support right now.
Why are you getting worried? I am telling you, right?
Oh yes! This is what a grand wedding looks like!
This is what the set up should look like
I just want the lights to be hung over here….
Yes, get them hung over here.
Yes!
And it’ll look beautiful once the flowers are also put.
I just want it to look nice.
I want everyone to see that it’s my Shebi’s wedding!
What is it? You’ve kept the tea, right?
Why are you standing over our heads now? Go!
I want to talk to the both of you.
Say it. What do you have to talk about?
Please don’t do this. Why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
Don’t get Shahab married to that girl!
Why are you also torturing your son by getting this marriage done?
I know that he isn’t happy with this marriage!
Oh you, quiet!
You cheap girl,
you’re standing in front of us and telling us what we should or shouldn’t do for our son?
Who even are you? What is your worth?
That we should ask you before making decisions for our son’s life?
You… You told me, right? Didn’t you tell me? You can make me swear upon anything
I’m ready to do everything!
You two wanted for me to never go to my home, right?
You wanted me to never meet my family, right?
? I won’t! I won’t even think about them!
But you please don’t get this marriage done! Please!
Nobody is going to get any good out of this marriage!
For god sake!
Get your hands off! Get your hands off!
tell her to go away from here before I lose my cool! Get her out! Get out!
Shahab is only mine. He loves me! Have mercy on me. For god sake!
Why don’t you leave! Go!
Shameem! Take her away!
Don’t let this marriage take place!
Leave already, slow motion!
She has come after my life!
She’s ruined the taste of my tea!
Yes so, what were you showing me?
She ruined the entire mood!
Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
How are you, uncle?
You tell me!
Are you happy after kicking your mom out of the house?
Uncle, I said it out of anger but she actually left.
Really? She left?
You keep insulting your mom on every little thing,
raise your hands on your siblings.
What else could she have done if not this? Tell me!
You know it very well that what she did was wrong.
Yes! I know it quite well!
But you have forgotten one thing, Babar.
That Chanda is also sister in law’s daughter. I admit that she has made a mistake
but that doesn’t mean that we cut all ties with her!
You made the same mistake too.
Should we have also done the same treatment with you?
I am very upset that instead of handling your responsibilities properly after Bhai Sahib’s passing,
you have destroyed that house!
Uncle, what would you have done if you were in my place?
God forbid that I’m ever in your place!
Don’t say that. I am your nephew, your blood!
Enough, enough! Enough!
How could you be someone else’s when you couldn’t be your own mothers?
Go! Get out of here! And stay happy in your life. Go! Go! Go!
You raised your hand on my son?
You wait and watch what I do to you, Babar!
How will I be able to live over here if you keep crying like this, Sitara?
I waited so much.
My heart was so full! Thank god you called.
Stay strong, Sitara.
You’re the only one who can stand as a support for Tayi Jaan.
I need you.
Leave Dubai, please come back here. Please!
If my plan for coming here was irrelevant, I would’ve come back.
But I have to earn loads of money for you, myself and for everyone, Sitara.
What’s the point of earning such money
that keeps you separated from your loved ones?
Given the circumstances, money is our biggest need right now.
Alright. You stay over there and earn lots of money.
But remember, what if the wealth that you have gone to earn,
separates you from your loved ones only?
What are you saying, Sitara?
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.
Take care of yourself. Allah Hafiz.
Hello? Sitara?
Erum!
Erum!
Where were you!
I told you that you aren’t feeling well and that you shouldn’t get out of the bed, right?
Come on, come! I’ll get you juice…
Babar. I have to tell you something.
Yes, go ahead. Everything’s fine, right?
A guest is about to come.
Who? Is Wajid Sahib coming?
No.
: Is it Umer? Maybe he wants to resolve the matter after the fight.
Someone who’s your own. Someone very close.
Erum, what riddles are you making me solve?
Tell me who is coming, fast.
So I can make the arrangements accordingly.
You are about to become a father
Alright. Then you could’ve told me this before so I….
What?
Me?
What? One minute. One minute.
You’re about to become a mother?
You can’t give me better news than this, Erum!
I’ll go tell mom right now. She’ll be so happy…
Listen, come you. Come and have your juice. Come.
Yes, Zain. Are you studying?
Uncle, you teach me English today.
But I don’t know English.
Why not?
Because we have only wasted time in school. In playing.
I never concentrated on my studies.
So that means that you are also a bad kid.
Haven’t you started talking too much these days?
Learn what I have told you to learn!
Uncle, look! She’s always scolding me.
Look, Sitara.  You don’t have to scold my lion son after today! Okay?
Sitara, clean this ASAP. I have to start cooking.
All of it?
I met Babar today.
I have asked you to do something! Clean it ASAP, I have to start cooking. Go.
I hope your children never treat you the way you have treated your mother.
I pray your children don’t abandon you the way you have abandoned your own siblings.
Babar!
What has happened to you? You seem tense.
I don’t know. I… I feel restless.
It feels like there’s something incomplete in this house.
I miss mom a lot.
. I don’t feel like doing anything without her.
And when I think about her,
, I think of the time when I insulted and kicked her out of the house.
I am going to bring her back!
Babar, at least hear me out…
You just tell me…
You should also come with me. You will come, right?
What can I say?
What do you mean what can you say? Will you come with me or not!
Yes, Babar. I will come with you. I’ll come.
You should come!
Yes.
You should come anyway. Alright. Come.
What are you doing here? Move!
She’s my wife.
Don’t touch her!
What can you do!
Babar! Babar!
Didn’t I ask you not touch her! She’s my wife. I am telling you….
I am making you understanding. Go back! Move away!
Babar! Babar! Babar!
Come here! Come!
Babar? Babar! Leave me!
Leave her. Leave her!
Babar! Babar! Babar!
I told you not to do it. Didn’t I!
Babar!
Why did you cut uncle while he was speaking?
You could’ve at least asked him what Bhai was saying, what does he want?
Erum is calling.
Hello?
What!
What happened?
Police have arrested Babar.
Oh no, Siddiqui Sahib! There’s no consumption like that these days.
It’s not like that, Sir. I am   your dear friend.
Done, Sir. Done.
. I will meet you once my duty ends, In Sha Allah.
In Sha Allah, yes. Allah Hafiz.
Yes, you speak?
Sir, I have brought him here. He was very difficult to catch.
Why? Are you a big thing now?
Forgive me, Sir. It won’t happen again.
I’ll fix you right now. Forgive you my foot! Take him!
I’ll give you a tour of the drawing room!
Sir? Sir…
Yes. You go ahead.
The police have arrested my son.
What’s your son’s name?
Babar Mansoor.
Look, he’s absolutely innocent. He has been arrested for no reason.
Wow!
There is a charge of attempt to murder on him!
And you’re saying he’s innocent?
This is a false allegation!
He was only trying to protect himself.
Someone was trying to kidnap our daughter in law…
There is a missing report filed in this police station of the girl
that you’re calling your daughter in law.
You let my son go.
can’t!
Do you know? The guy that your son has hit is in ICU right now.
You just pray that he survives otherwise your son will be hung for sure.
