It was my fault that I went to meet Chanda.
You shouldn’t have gone to meet her.
You know she’s not feeling well. She’s expecting a baby.
When we have don’t have any contact with api then how can we have any contact with her relations..
A child’s relationship with her mother doesn’t end even after death.
The children will be called out by the name of their mothers on the day of judgment.
The children should think about that..
If the children have hurt their mother and their mother is upset with them, then?
Children make mistakes. A mother does get hurt but she forgives, she doesn’t stay upset.
You have forgiven api, you’re not upset with her but brother and dad still are.
You don’t worry, everything will be fine. Listen, Babar shouldn’t find about the Danish matter
it would have been great if she would have been smart about it.
Uncle, you’re with us so we don’t need anyone else
and we won’t keep any contact with anyone else.
Anyway, it’s getting late, mama and dad are waiting. Shall we go?
Should I tell you something honestly?
My home will become so empty after she leaves
but you have to promise me something Shebi, you will take good care of my princess.
Don’t worry uncle, I’ll treat her like a princess. She’ll rule in our house.
God bless you. Stay happy. khud hafiz.
And thank you so much.
Your uncle’s doors will always be open for you.
Khuda hafiz.
So uncle, your expenses have ended then, find another way now.
Welcome! Welcome! Come Shebi.
Come, come. Bismillah! Bismillah!
She has finally arrived at her own home.
My sweet daughter in law, may God always keep you happy.
Give me some money, I’ll caste off the evil eye.
Yes, here you go..
May God keep you away from the evil eye.
May you always stay happy and keep my son happy as well.
We had many dreams of doing a grand wedding
but you two didn’t give us a chance. So your aunty did some arrangements and setting.
Mama, thank you for all that you did.
Look at that, you’re saying thank you to us? Great.
All these clothes and jewelry are for you. Dress up nicely, look beautiful and stay happy.
Will you just keep on chatting or will you arrange for some food?
Yes of course. I’ve cooked everything myself today for my daughter in law.
You cooked yourself? Shebi then let’s go out to eat.
You’re too much! Shameem! Serve the food!
Please Serve it Shameem!
Shall I show you the jewelry? I got it made specially for you.
Dad! Dad, what happened?
Nothing son. I felt just a little dizzy.
Why did you go to the office in this condition? You shouldn’t have.
Who goes there to have fun? One has to go to work.
That’s true dad but I’m here, I’ll handle the responsibility.
You don’t go to the office for a few days, please rest.
No, I’m fine. You don’t worry. I’ll rest for a while now, I’ll be fine by morning.
Still.. you’re not taking care of your diet maybe. Come I’ll take you inside..
I’ll go myself..
Asalam o alikum. Shall I serve you dinner?
You can’t even take care of dad now as well?
When you could see he’s not well then why did you let him go to the office?
Take care of his diet and what has happened?
He was feeling absolutely fine till yesterday. Did something happen at home?
Nothing has happened. He’ll have food, he’ll rest for a while and he’ll be fine. You also come..
Open your eyes now..
Chanda, how did you find your new home?
It feels as if I’m dreaming.
Dreaming with my eyes open and somebody might wake me up.
One must learn how to turn dreams into reality from you.
I am very lucky that you chose me, that you made me your companion.
I wish mom could see me like this today,
I wish she could see how much respect I got here
only she could understand that Chanda’s decision was absolutely right
but I feel sorry
that she could never understand me. She always thought I was wrong.
I don’t know Chanda but for some reason she though me and my family are wrong for you.
She has really hurt my parents.
And you saw how mama and dad gave you such a grand welcome for the sake of my love,
they accepted you.
I am very embarrassed.
I apologize from their side..
Chanda, what’s wrong? What are you doing?
You’ll see when dad will find out everyone has accepted me and I’m living in this house now,
he will come to apologize himself and mom will also apologize and everything will be fine.
There will be no issue, no tension in our life anymore.
Actually Chanda, I have made a promise to dad.
What kind of promise?
That after coming in this house, you can’t go to your parent’s house.
You can’t keep any contact with anyone.
This is your home now..
Alright.
I’ll keep no contact. You’ve done so much for me,
I can do anything for you, I can cross every limit for you but if sometimes with dad…
Not with anyone now.
Only me, you and our home.
Don’t be upset, please don’t be upset.
You can scold me, you can hit me but don’t be upset with me please.
Ask her to leave. I don’t want to speak to her.
Mansoor, the poor thing is apologizing..
Am I a child?
Am I mentally unstable? Am I mad
that you’re making me understand and I am not understanding?
No no, I am not saying that.
You won’t understand. I should go from here in fact leave the house.
Mansoor! Mansoor!
What?
Where are you going?
Sitara you go from here.
Ask her to take all this.
You go.
Sister in law! Asalam o alikum.
Walikum Salam. Is everything okay?
Is brother at home?
No, he’s out, he must be coming.
I have brought good news for you.
Mashallah Chanda’s in laws have accepted her, Shebi took her home.
Oh God, thank you for listening to my prayers.
Your prayers didn’t come in handy maybe
but I think the hearts of the parents melted out of love for their son.
I bought Chanda’s medicine from the store, the bill is only for 3 thousand rupees.
You’re well aware of my financial position,
it has become a problem for me to go by the store now.
Muraad I don’t have any money right now.
I’ll take it from him when he comes and I’ll drop them by your house.
Oh no no, why should you bother?
Besides Chanda is not there anymore. Let me know, I’ll come by and take them.
Brother..
I told you!
I told you that Chanda is dead to us!
Mansoor I..
What are you saying? Chanda is our daughter..
You!
Mansoor what happened? What happened?
Are you feeling okay?
Get a hold of yourself! Mansoor!
Mansoor! Mansoor please get up for the sake of God! Mansoor!
You’re not only the daughter in law but also a daughter of this house.
And we are very embarrassed for the pain we caused you.
What are you saying?
In fact I am embarrassed from the both of you.
My family, my mother treated you so badly but you still accepted me..
That is true but it’s okay.
And mom, all these gifts just for your daughter in law? You won’t ask your son what he wants?
What do you want? Tell me?
What is Shebi saying?
I’ll take the gift from you.
Who is calling?
Uncle, my uncle is calling..
Should I pick it up?
Yes sure.. talk.. talk to him..
Asalam o alikum uncle.
What is it? Why are you so worried?
What? Dad suffered a heart attack?
I’m coming. I am reaching right now.
I have to go dad. We’ll have to go right now. Dad suffered a heart attack..
Shebi! Shebi wait!
Chanda!
He went right after her. What we said was of no affect.
It will get affected, it will get affected now..
Uncle, where is dad? What happened to him?
Is everything okay?
Brother suffered a serious heart attack. The doctor is treating him.
Pray nothing happens to my brother..
Where is mom?
This way..
Mom.
What happened to dad? Why do you guys not tell me anything ever?
Why do you hide everything from me? Why did you bring him to the hospital?
Nothing has happened..
If nothing has happened then… God forbid if something happens to dad then…
Nothing will happen to dad. Nothing will happen to him.
He’s not well that’s why we have brought him to the hospital. He’ll be fine.
Nothing is going to happen to him right?
Uncle! Uncle! How is dad feeling?
Where are you going?
I want to see him!
How dare you come here?
I want to see dad! I want to see dad!
Don’t call him dad with this dirty language of yours!
He is my father too! You move from here! Move!
For god sake, just tell us how uncle’s health is?
I should tell the two of you? My father is in this condition today, only because of you two!
Go from here, otherwise…
Babar!
Otherwise what? What will you do?
Chanda, for god sake! Babar Bhai is very furious right now…
So what if he’s angry? What do I do? He’s my father!
He isn’t feeling well! But no one is letting me go to him!
Babar! What are you doing!
I am telling you! Send him away from here!
Take me where? Take me where!
Uncle, I want to see dad… He is my father too!
I want to see him once! I want to see him just once!
Enough! Enough! I say come with me!
Uncle, just let me meet him once… Dad!
What, did Chanda come? I heard her voice. Where is she, where did she go?
You’re still concerned about her? Dad fell sick the one time she had come. I’m sure she must’ve done something this time too! Tell me, right now!
Dad fell sick the one time she had come.
I’m sure she must’ve done something this time too! Tell me, right now!
Tell me right now! What happened? What did Chanda do!
Chanda didn’t do anything, Babar. Actually, your uncle…
Excuse me.
Doctor! Dad is fine, right?
Sorry. We couldn’t save him.
What is up with this guard?
I would’ve been able to meet dad if you hadn’t fought with Babar Bhai today.
What? You think that I fought with Babar?
He may hit me, push me. All of that is okay?
I should bow down in front of him and keep listening?
And what is my fault? That I committed the sin of marrying you? That’s it?
That is not what I meant.
What did you mean then? Tell me!
I would’ve gotten some satisfaction if I had seen dad or met him.
Chanda, you are well aware of our house’s situation, right?
Didn’t I take you to the hospital even though mom and dad were against it?
Yes, you took me but I still couldn’t meet dad.
I don’t get you!
Alright. You can go if you want to see your dad.
Go all you want. You have full permission from my side!
Mansoor.
Mansoor.
Wake up!
Wake up! You know what?
Chanda has come to meet you.
Everyone is waiting for you outside. Nothing has happened to you.
You’re just a little unwell. You will be fine.
Wake up, please.
Mansoor!
I can’t live without you.
What will I do? Don’t leave me alone.
I can’t live without you. Wake up!
Nothing has happened to you. You just have a little temperature, that’s it. I’ll go call someone.
Babar! Babar!
Babar, go and call Chanda. You know? Dad’s missing her.
Nothing has happened. He’s just unconscious because of the operation.
He’ll come back to his senses right now.
You go and bring Zain and Sitara too. Don’t… Don’t do this. Listen to me!
Mom! At least listen to me.
Listen to me. He would want to see everyone when he becomes conscious, right!
Mom, no. Listen to me. Dad is no longer alive! He is dead, mom.
Don’t talk rubbish!
Try to understand, mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, what happened?
Go and bring water! Water! Go and get water, fast!
Mom! Mom!
That wasn’t nice.
The way you left without asking for our permission.
Our house’s women can’t even think of doing that.
We aren’t heartless! We don’t have a heart of stone.
We do sympathize with your father.
You do sympathize with a patient.
But what about the insult that he has caused to this house?
You are this house’s member now. Think of here too!
A lot!
We have bared a lot for the two of you. But…
Let me talk…
Not right now!
There’s a limit to how much we can take!
Just so your relationship doesn’t suffer,
we made the decision of asking for the promise from you two to never keep any contact with them.
The ones who don’t care about your relationship or your life. They’re just patients of their ego.
Mama. Baba.
We are very embarrassed for whatever happened today.
And we promise to you that you won’t get a reason to complain again after today.
Am I right,
Chanda?
Chanda!
What am I saying?
What…
No one will pick up the phone.
Let me just talk to him once?
Don’t pick up the phone if you want to live in this house.
Hello! What is this, why are you calling again and again…..
What!
Let me talk! Hello?
What!
Dad is no more?
Dad has left.
Chanda.
Dad is no more. Dad has left.
Chanda,
get hold of yourself.
Dad!
Chanda. Chanda. Chanda!
Chanda!
Chanda!
Chanda!
Dad, look at her. Chanda, come to your senses. Chanda!
No. No, Danish. No. I can’t see my brother’s face.
I can’t see my dead brother’s face! I can’t see his funeral!
Pull yourself together, dad.
How do I pull myself together?
He! All my life, my brother took care of me.
The one who held me has left himself! How do I pull myself together!
Danish! You don’t know
how much pain my brother has seen before dying!
I wish!
I wish brother hadn’t fought with sister in law before dying!
I wish Chanda hadn’t misbehaved with my brother because dying!
So then today my brother would’ve been alive!
I have become an orphan now!
I have become an orphan! I have become an orphan! I have become an orphan! An orphan!
What happened?
I have become an orphan!
Go and bring water.
Nothing is left!
Uncle, have courage. Who’s going to look after us if you don’t show courage?
Babar! You don’t know!
Brother had a very serious fight with sister in law before dying!
Brother felt pain over here and then he fell.
I wish! I wish that fight hadn’t taken place.
I wish that Chanda hadn’t done all of that. Then your father would’ve been alive today!
I wish that this mannerlessness hadn’t taken place today. This is all Chanda’s fault!
Sister in law had a fight with brother. Brother felt the pain and he fell! My brother is dead!
Chanda! What is this that you have done! What did you do, Chanda!
She’s unconscious right now.
But what if she forces again on going home once she’s back to her senses, then?
You talk in senses. I think you are unconscious
Should I put my generation at stake and send her at the funeral?
No! This will not happen
Look, you have done what you wanted to but I won't let this happen.
Look, Shebi. We care so much about you. Don’t you care about your child?
Alright. If you can take the guarantee that nothing would happen to her, then take her.
Whatever influence it might have on her then. Okay!
No! Son, anyway they say that if you take them to a funeral in this condition
then the ghosts get into your body.
And then in life, your brain stops working! You lose control of yourself!
What rubbish are you talking?
No, brother, no! Be a man, my child! Be a man!
But no! You will anyway do as you wish.
Alright then. It’s his child. He understands better. Do whatever you like.
Alright.
Shebi! Don’t get worried. We are here, right? We are outside only. Okay?
Son, I can’t take this!
Pull yourself together, dad.
How do I pull myself together?
Wajid Bhai! He was my father! I have become an orphan today!
Have patience. Have patience.
I have become an orphan, Wajid Bhai!
I have become an orphan! How will I take care of myself?
It has gotten late. We should get going. Let’s go. Go inform inside. Come.
No, Wajid Bhai! I have become an orphan!
Everybody has to go. You have some courage.
How do I show courage? Bhai Sahib! Who have you left me with! Bhai Sahib!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Did dad call me? Is he asking for me? Move!
He is calling me!
Chanda, listen to me!
I want to go to Dad! I want to go to Dad!
You didn’t let me go to dad, right? I want to go to my dad, he’s calling me! Don’t you understand!
Chanda!
Dad!
Pull yourself together!
Dad!
Dad!
No, no, no, no, no!
Have patience, my child. Have patience.
No, no, no. Please, no! No! No!
Someone stop them! No! No, brother, no! Please don’t take him! Mom!
Where are you taking my father? Where are you taking my father?
Mom didn’t even meet him!
I can’t live without him! My mom…. Mom! Mom!
Mom!
They took dad! You do something! Why are you standing like this?
Mom, do something! Mom! Mom! Mom! Do something!
I want to go to dad!
Chanda!
How can dad leave me like this?
Chanda, what has happened! Where are you going!
I want to go to dad. I want to see his face for the last time. I have to ask for forgiveness from him!
What has happened to you? We can’t go!
Why can’t we go!
Have you forgotten? We made a promise to mama and baba!
It’s my dad’s funeral over there and you care about your promise!
Chanda, please! Please, try to understand.
You try to understand! Let me go.
I want to see dad’s face for the last time,  ask for forgiveness.
I couldn’t even see his face! I won’t go ever again! Let me just go to dad right now…
Chanda. You can’t go!
Why can’t I go?
Because it’s not right for a woman to go to a funeral in this condition…
I don’t believe in such things! I want to go! That’s it!
You can’t go!
Why can’t I go! If it was your dad’s funeral instead of mine, what would you have done?
Shut up!
