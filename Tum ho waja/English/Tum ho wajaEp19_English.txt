Mom, my stomach is hurting..
What happened? I had told you not to start eating spicy food so soon
and you don’t listen..
I think he’s suffering from indigestion, mom give him some medicine
The medicine is in my.. I mean to say in the cupboard in your room.
Erum, take out the medicine and give it to him
Babar!
Yes! I’ll be back in two minutes..
I’m leaving, I’ll come some other day..
No no, please have your tea.
I’m coming in two minutes, just two minutes. Please.
Okay. I’ll keep sitting here then..
Sitara..
Why are you here..
Why have you started being frightened around me?
Please go from here. Why have you come?
I brought chocolates for you, look..
: I don’t want anything. Please go inside.
Okay sure.
I will give you anything you want, you want gold?
I don’t want anything!
I will give it to you..
Nothing! I don't want anything!
I will give you anything you want..
What are you doing?
What is happening?
What’s happening?
If you are invited somewhere with respect
then you mustn't forget to show respect for yourself and to the people of the house.
What has happened? What have I done?
Tell me? What have I done?
You know exactly what I'm talking about! Don't do this next time.
Leave my collar!
I won’t spare you! And you too!
Move!
We were up all night, right Ikram?
Where is Shahab? Call him..
Shebi! Shebi was home all day then he got a call,
his friend got into an accident and is in the ICU. That's what it was right?
Yes yes..
He hasn't come back yet. Find out.
Accident? I hope everything is okay?
Yes yes.. We should serve the food now..
Should I serve the food then?
No, I’m not hungry yet..
We have made a lot of cuisines like italian, chinese
and you’re saying you won’t eat?
All of us will eat together when Shahab comes..
Shebi will come..
I was saying then we had enough of hunting..
I got hurt on the shoulder..
How can he leave without informing us? Listen, where is Mr. Wajid?
What happened to her?
I don't know what has happened to her..
Mr. Wajid has left and I think something happened..
What could have happened..
Ask Sitara what has happened..
What do you mean? How would she know?
She means to say that Sitara and he must have said something to Mr. Wajid
otherwise he wouldn't have left without informing us.
It’s pretty obvious that all of them didn't like that Mr. Wajid came here.
Babar, I had told you before that you should plan the dinner somewhere outside.
Now a scene has been created..
One minute, I’ll call and ask him..
Sitara?
What happened?
Has something happened? What happened, tell me..
What happened
I think we should get going, it’s getting late.
What we came to talk to you about has been done.
I think we should pick a date of this month and get them married on that date.
And besides I am very restless now, I want you to become my daughter in law and come home soon.
He’s here! Shebi! Shebi! Look who is here, Ikram uncle and his daughter Sana. You remember right?
Hi Shahab,
how are you?
Uncle told me about the accident, is everything okay?
Asalam o alikum.
Shake his hand.
What are you looking at?
Chanda..
No no Shebi, this is not Chanda.
You’re laughing.
You’re making fun of me.
You killed my child right?
What?
Then why are you alive yourself?
Shebi!
Shahab, what are you saying?
Why don’t you just die? Why don’t you just die?
Let’s go! Let’s go!
Make him sit! Make him sit!
Get out!
Let’s go from here! Let’s go!
Get out! Get out of here!
: I told you before, this is not the right place!
Did you take a look at that boy!
Ikram..
Uncle, please let me handle this..
Okay handle..
Listen..
Carefully son..
What’s wrong mama? Get out of here! Get out!
Did she leave?
Move! Put some water on his head..
What do you mean by put water..
I will sit here only, this is my house!
Shebi..
Get out of here!
Enough..
What do they say mama? We’ve stopped causing pain to our heart.
You humiliated me!
Ikram left and he.. Lie down, why don’t you just lie down here..
Mama, you should also stop..
Stop it, you won’t gain anything.
Come on, stand up..
It was better if you would’ve hit me with this shoe!
My young boy..
Why don’t you move the bed here only.. He left.. The whole plan got ruined..
Shebi..
Shh, Do this Shh only..
Quiet, everyone quiet.. Enough, enough son..
I feel like killing Wajid
and get rid of all the problems by bringing Sitara here.
Get out! Get out of here!
But uncle..
Get out of here!
Uncle..
Sitara and he must have said something to Mr. Wajid
otherwise he wouldn't have left without informing us.
I am telling you for the last time that Shebi is not worthy of you.
You are destroying your life for no reason because of your stubbornness.
Papa, you have promised me. You can't go on your word now okay?
Goodnight.
Sana. Sana, listen to me. Sana!
Babar, take a look at this. Mr. Wajid has given such a nice watch.
: Keep it, I’ll take a look at it later.
What’s the matter? Atleast talk to me nicely..
Whatever happened, shouldn't have.
I think Mr. Wajid has realised that everyone’s behavior with him wasn’t nice.
Maybe it wasn’t what you think.
There’s a chance that he actually got a call and he left due to some important work.
That’s not possible
because he could have received at least one call.
I've been calling him since so long now..
What are you trying to say then? That maybe sitara?
That’s possible too,
Sitara is the  youngest but she has a sharp tongue,
she has no respect for elders.
I'm sure she must have said something and Mr. Wajid got upset and he left.
I’m just worried about the fact that how will I face Mr. Wajid..
Let’s one thing Babar,
we have to go to the state agent for our shop in the morning
so we’ll leave a little early and meet Mr. Wajid as well.
But what will we do if he is really upset about something?
We’ll apologize to him, what’s the big deal about that?
You’re getting worried for no reason.
Don’t take too much stress. Everything will be fine.
The queen is sleeping.
Wake up! Chanda!
I hope she’s not dead. Go bring water quickly.
A new issue will rise otherwise..
Come quickly Tara! Sprinkle water on her.
Sprinkle more water.
She’s moving
Wake up nuisance!
We’ll be rid of her if she dies.
She wont die so easily..
She has made our lives hell.
You two have made our lives hell..
She started taking as soon as she gained consciousness..
Why are you doing this?
You have filled so much poison in Shahabs heart
that he doesn't even want to see my face.
Do you have any fear of God in your heart?
Do you have any fear of God that your trapped our only son?
Whatever we are doing is right.
You may think it's wrong but we’re doing right by our son.
Thank god he hates you.
Who will believe you?
You’ve run away from home,
who will listen to you?
You don't have anyone to rely on
Listen to me, you have to do one thing,
be quiet..quiet. Don't speak okay?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this? What have I done
Be quiet! Quiet..
Don't make any noise..
Good girl okay? Good girl. Go to sleep, you’re sleepy. Send some food for her.
Will you eat?
Lie done.
Not a word.
Stop with your drama. Get up and come outside.
Be thankful that you get food to eat two times a day.
Come outside.
Nothing! I don't want anything!
will give you anything you want..
What are you doing?
That slap will cost you Sitara.
I must make you mine now.
Sitara, move, I want to iron my clothes.
Mom has to go to the doctor, wait for a little while.
Our commitment is more important than the doctor. Move!
Who are you showing this attitude to?
I’ll show you what I can do, you won’t listen otherwise.
Move.
What..
Babar! Babar! Babar, take a look at what Sitara did!
What happened? Why are you shouting?
What happened?
Babar, your sister has gone mad!
She burnt my hand.
. I had only asked her to give me mom’s clothes, I’ll iron them but take a look at what she did.
You’re lying, you’re so vicious..
Have you gone mad!
Are you in your senses? You’re going to raise your hand on your sister?
And what are you standing here for? Go to your room!
Mom, I really didn’t..
All I see is you causing trouble all the time,
you’ve ruined the peace of this house!
Go!
Do you see her behavior? Please make her understand.
Look, she burnt my hand so bad..
Come, I’ll apply paste on this, come..
I didn’t expect this from you.
Trust me, I was restless the whole night.
I kept wanting for it to be the next morning somehow
and so that I meet you and ask you..
Ask me what? Did I do something to offend you?
How can we get offended by you?
I was just worried to see that you left so suddenly yesterday..
Actually… I got an important phone call so I had to leave in urgency.
Really?
I was very worried.
Thinking maybe you got offended by us.
Oh no, son. Why would I get upset with you guys?
I was just about to call you myself. But you’ve also brought our daughter in law along.
I had to take Erum for shopping so we thought of visiting you along the way.
That’s very nice!
So then you do one thing.
How long will you keep roaming around with her on a motorcycle?
Take my car
and when you’re done with your outing, can you give it back?
No, no. there’s no need for that, Wajid Sahib. It’s not a problem.
Babar!
Babar, it doesn’t look nice saying no if he’s insisting so much.
Yes!
Listen. Tell the driver to give the white car’s key to Babar. He’s coming.
Aapi! Aapi! Open the door! Open the door, Aapi! Aapi!
Don’t do such a thing that we might not be able to give answers for!
Nothing that big has happened that you’re sitting inside with the door locked!
Open the door!
You think this is a petty issue?
I’m not sad about the fact that Bhai raised his hand on me
but about the fact that you held me accountable for it!
When did I say that?
So then why did you scold me in front of everyone?
Because you’re my own! I can scold you and you won’t take offence!
I didn’t do anything!
I didn’t do anything wrong. She’s falsely accusing me!
She just wants to cause issues between Bhai and us. That’s it.
Don’t keep such things in your heart.
The circumstances will get uglier and we won’t be able to live in the same house!
You guys understand, right?
Alright, mom. I won’t trouble you anymore.
I won’t give you a chance to complain either.
I’m practicing English and he’s acting like a Romeo?
Getting intoxicated?
Did you only have last night to get drunk?
Dad, it was just with my friends last night….
Friends?
Friends for money!
Don’t you dare sit with these goons again!
What has happened to you!
I’m not a kid anymore. I have grown up!
Oh, then grow up! Grow up, please! Act like a grown up then!
Gone are the luxuries! Finished!
Now show us and become something!
Come, come, come… Sana. Come!
Hi.
Shebi! Say sorry.
Last night, you drink very much and misbehaved. Say sorry!
Yes, son. We’re sorry for whatever happened last night.
Sorry.
Uncle,
if you don’t mind… I’d like to speak to Shahab in private.
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
We go. We go to. Shebi! Shake hand. Okay. Bye.
The same anger, the same eyes and that same arrogance!
You haven’t changed a bit.
You’re exactly the same.
Shahab,
look at me at least.
Please?
Mom!
What happened?
I saw Aapi in my dream. She was crying a lot!
A dream is just a dream, right? You don’t worry,
your Aapi is absolutely fine in her home.
how do you know? Did you go to meet her?
My heart says that she’s very happy at her house
Is she really that happy over there that she’s forgotten everyone over here?
You do know why I’ve come back in your life, right?
Yes!
Your or my dad wants to get us married.
Not dad, me!
He never wanted me to get married to you.
That’s what I want! Shahab, I want to marry you.
But now... what do you want?
That’s the only thing that I need to know.
What do I want?
you know how much I like you, right?
I left the country when you rejected me the first time.
I won’t go anywhere this time.
I’ll wait for you my entire life, Shahab.
Do you know how much I love you?
I know! It’s Chanda because of whom you didn’t marry me, right?
Who is she? Who the hell is she!
I am Chanda!
Shahab’s wife!
What?
She’s not my wife.
you have forgotten.
I am still married to you.
So let’s end this relationship right now.
You can’t end a soulful relationship with words.
I made a mistake.
I don’t know what got into me that I decided to marry her.
You also love me, right?
But I never understood that.
You never got married only for me?
It’s great! Isn’t it true what they say…?
You name your whole life after the one person you fall in love with.
I will marry you!
You don’t have any objections, right?
Let me call uncle right now and apologize to him.
Okay?
Plenty of men take decisions under influence.
And then they’re pushed to marry.
You know what I mean, right?
But I’ll show you how to be a daughter in law of a respectable family!
He will not marry you!
He only loves me!
And that’s why I’m here today.
Really?
Challenge accepted!
Let the show begin!
So I… wanted to ask for something from you.
What do I even have that I can give to you?
e only thing I had was my existence and I have already given that to you.
What else do you want?
Actually…. I’m very upset because of whatever happened between you and Sitara.
Babar, I try my best!
But I don’t know why she dislikes me so much. I really don’t understand!
I understand that you’re trying your best.
It’s a new atmosphere, new people.
It does get hard to understand them.
But I am certain,
all the matters will get solved if you and Sitara become friends.
you don’t worry, Babar.
I’ll try my best to make Sitara understand.
Thank you!
Oh! Have your coconut water.
Do you know it’s a nice thing,
you should try a little so the house’s atmosphere stays positive
Everyone stays happy and we talk about nice things….
Babar!
What happened?
Babar, let’s go from where.
But what happened all of a sudden? We have just ordered the food…
Babar, what am I telling you? Please, let’s go from here!
You’re getting worried because of him?
It’s nice that he’s here. I’ll go and talk to him. Let’s get it over with…
Wait!
What has gotten into you?
You don’t know him!
He’s a very dangerous person, he’ll kill us!
I’m here with you, right?
Trust me on this. We should talk to him today!
Babar, please for my sake, let’s go!
But…
No ifs and buts, nothing! I don’t want to hear anything. Let’s go, please!
Why are you doing this!
How much time is left for your flight to take off?
Dad, the flight is in 6 hours
but you’re supposed to reach the airport 3 hours before time.
Really?
Either my watch has stopped working or the time just isn’t passing.
Dad?
What happened!
There’s one thing.
I don’t know how to say it to you.
I’ll give you one slap!
You’re hesitating? That too with me?
You have to go to Tayi Jaan and ask for Sitara’s proposal for me.
Danish, how did this thought cross your mind?
Dad, I have liked Sitara for a long time.
I never made it visible.
I was just waiting for the right time, that’s it.
You’re a big secret keeper!
And Tayi Jaan knows this from before.
Really?
Alright!
You don’t worry.
And anyway I wanted you to get married soon
so our house becomes a little lively too.
And who can be a better daughter in law than Sitara?
thank you, dad!
Dad, can I go and say my goodbyes to Tayi Jaan?
Yes, yes. Go!
Okay, dad!
Silly!
I wanted to get him married into a big wealthy family and he chose Sitara? Huh!
Carefully, son!
Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car!
I’ll drive the car.
I’ll drive it!
Didn’t I just say I’ll drive it…
I said the same, right?
Chanda!
Yes?
What rubbish did you say to Sana?
Tell me what you said!
I didn’t say anything wrong.
Whatever I said is the truth.
Nobody can come between me and Shahab!
And who’s going to stop?
You?
You aren’t worth two pennies!
That’s it, that’s enough!
You test my patience so much otherwise….
What? What will you do? What will you do?
Leave me!
Tell me! What will you do?
What are you doing!
Mom!
You? Where did you come from?
And how did you enter my house?
It’s good that I came!
Otherwise I never would’ve known the torture my daughter is put through!
Your daughter is paying for what your and her deeds!
She won’t anymore!
My daughter is not an orphan!
Come on. Let’s go, Chanda.
Go where?
Home?
This is my home now, mom.
I have to die in this house only now.
