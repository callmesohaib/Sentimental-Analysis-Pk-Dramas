You can’t do this to me. While I’m there…
What?
While you’re there?
You have also died for me!
I have died?
Chanda has died?
Our baby also died.
Chanda also died.
How is that possible?
I left everything for you.
I upset everyone for you.
You left me..
How can you leave me..
Am I such a bad person?
Am I such a bad person that everyone left me?
Everyone left me.. left me..
Yes, I am a bad person..
Everything happened because of me..
I hurt my father's feelings then I hurt my mother’s feelings..
Nobody forgave me..
Dad died because of me,
mom stayed worried and now Shahab left me..
My baby also died..
I have nothing left..
Am I such a bad person..
Why did this happen to me..
Dad..
I had gone to Chanda’s house, I thought of telling you how she’s doing.
How is she doing then?
Chanda did take such a big step out of her foolishness but..
What? Tell me..
I wish I didn't have to tell you all this but
the truth is that her in laws behavior is not right with her
But Shebi loves her a lot
Yes yes,
I also used to believe the same before
but now he has also changed quite a bit.
They have beat our sweet little Chanda like an animal
: I should visit her..
No no,
right now the time is not right. You should wait for a few days.
A few days?
Don’t leave her on her own.
Yes of course, don’t worry about that. I’ll keep visiting her.
Where’s Babar?
He has gone to the office.
He didn’t tell you?
What?
He left his job from the workshop.
He was saying he’ll start his own business,
he was asking for money but I couldn't give him..
He left his job?
Why?
Why did he hide it from me?
I don't know.. What can I say..
I should be leaving. Khuda hafiz.
I understand the fact that your responsibilities must have increased after your wedding
and besides it’s tough to maintain a livelihood with just a job
That is why I’m thinking of starting my own business somehow.
That’s good, I’ll try helping you out in every possible way.
That is why I have come to you.
You don't know how grateful I am to you.
You stood with us in our difficult time.
Why are you embarrassing me?
Here you go..
Best of luck.
Thank you so much.
You don't know the favor you’ve done for me.
And I promise you,
I will return each and every penny of yours before time.
I know that you are a very self respecting person
and you will return each and every penny of mine but I have one complaint..
Which is?
You got married secretly and didn't even tell me.
If I would have come, all I would have had were sweets, what else.
You have the right to complain.
Why don’t you come to our house for dinner tonight?
We’ll serve you some sweets and you’ll also get to meet your daughter in law.
Alright then,
I’ll get to meet my daughter in law as well.
Alright done.
I’ll see you tonight for dinner then.
I should be leaving then. Thank you so much,
You’re welcome.
For dinner..
Hello?
Yes?
Alright sure, we’ll see.
Yes.
Okay.
Alright okay. Khuda hafiz.
Mom?
Yes?
What has happened?
You seem worried since uncle has left.
There’s nothing to be worried about.
I’m sure he has said something about Api,
that is why you’re so worried.
She’s not happy there..
How can she stay happy by hurting you?
For the love of God Sitara don’t say such things,
she’s your sister.
I can't see her unhappy.
So much happened because of her.
It’s shocking to see that you’re not upset with her.
You won’t understand.
I don't even want to understand.
All I know is that dad is not with us today because of the step she took.
If she hadn't taken that step then dad would have been with us today
and our family wouldn't have been in such a condition.
We cannot change what is destined.
She would have never done this
if she would have known that our conditions would turn out this way
and nor would her condition be this way.
She’s facing the consequences for what she did.
She has chosen this life for herself.
You or I can’t do anything about that.
I don’t love you. It was my misunderstanding, my mistake
And now the time to fix that mistake has come.
I will only do what my mom and dad decide for me now!
Who are you?
Who are you to talk to me like this?
This is my decision. I will do whatever I like. Do you understand?
Don’t keep yourself in any misconception.
I'm well aware of these dramas of yours.
What do you think Chanda?
that you’ll melt Shebi’s heart by crying like this?
I won't let that happen.
I still haven’t forgotten my insult.
You are still not satisfied even by putting me in this situation?
Chanda,
this is just the beginning, wait and watch what I’ll do to you.
I am only quiet because of Shahab otherwise..
Otherwise? otherwise what?
What will you do Chanda?
I think you’re forgetting,
Shahab himself humiliated you infront of me.
Don’t fool yourself,
no one has more value for Shahab than his mother.
Do you understand?
So much anger?
How is this their fault?
Eat them.
Babar! Such a huge cheque?
That means we can start our own work?
Ofcourse.
I’ll keep this cheque close to my heart.
Both of us will work very hard
and our designs will be popular everywhere.
Okay stop now.
One shouldn't think too much beforehand only.
There is one thing though,
I feel so good to see you happy after such a long time.
I was seeing you worried for so long.
I am at peace to see the satisfaction on your face today that is why I'm so happy.
Always stay happy like this.
Babar?
I wanted to talk to you about something..
Yes, say it?
I wanted to get some clothes made for myself, only if you think it’s reasonable.
Why wouldn't I think it’s reasonable?
Do you know, I also feel that I didn’t take you out for shopping after our marriage.
I couldn't afford it but as soon as I cash this cheque, both of us will go shopping.
Babar, you are actually very nice.
There’s no need to butter me up now.
Listen listen listen.. thank god I remembered,
get dressed really nicely tonight. There’s a guest coming for dinner tonight..
Is it a special guest?
Mr. Wajid.
He owes us a lot of favors.
He has stood by us in our tough times
which is why I want us two in fact all of us to treat him well.
Don't worry, everything will be prepared and it will take place really nicely.
Alright. I’ll arrange the food then.
Alright
Danish!
Yes dad?
What are you doing?
Dad, my flight is tomorrow so I thought of packing everything beforehand.
Good. Have you kept your passport?
Yes dad.
Dad, are you sad?
Obviously son,
why would you even ask such a question?
You are my only support.
This house will become very empty when you leave.
You’ll see how this time will pass so quickly,
you won’t even feel it and a year will pass at a snap of a finger.
It’s easier for you to say
but I know how difficult it will be for me to pass this year.
Don't say that dad. Look, I’ll call you everyday.
I’ll ask you to join me as soon as it’s possible.
May God make you successful.
Are you crying dad?
Please be strong and besides I won’t be happy being so far away from you
and if you’ll cry like this, then I will also lose my spirit.
No no, no son.
I'm not crying, I'm very happy, very happy.
What else do I need other than to see my son being successful?
May God keep you happy and make you successful.
I have to do my packing now.
I told you, if you’ll keep crying like this then I’ll lose my spirit.
I’m fine. I’m fine.
Babar?
Yes?
Your uncle came,
he told me you left your job.
Yes, I had to leave it.
You didn't even tell me?
I didn't tell you because I knew you would get worried..
Till when would this have stayed hidden from me?
Anyway, what do you want to do next?
I’ve planned on starting my own business.
You’ll need a lot of money for that…
Yes, I will need money for it. But you don’t worry, I’ve made an arrangement for that.
You took them from Wajid Sahib.
How do you know?
I am your mother. How can I not know what my children are up to?
What’s strange is that you did the same thing you were getting upset with me for!
Really?
Then you tell me, what else could I have done?
Who do I take money from to start a business?
Wajid Sahib is still our deceased father’s friend.
All of this doesn’t seem right to me.
You just trust me then
Don’t think about it. If I've taken money, I’ll also give it back on time.
You don’t have to worry!
Anyway, I’ve called him over for dinner tonight. Make the preparations.
Look, I used to have an argument with Mansoor over this only.
I don’t like that person coming here.
And you’ve called him here for dinner?
You talk great sometimes!
A person has done so much for us,
he’s stood with us through all the hardships
and you don’t like him coming over for dinner?
I won’t argue with you on this matter anymore.
I have told him and he’s coming today!
You for god sake, act nicely with him.
Yes, yes, Ikram. You heard it right!
I want our friendship to turn into a family relationship.
Yes, yes. Even Shebi is ready this time.
You just bring sister in law and Sana over tonight.
Have dinner with us. We’ll sit and talk.
Alright? Yeah, alright. Okay. Okay. Khuda Hafiz!
What was he saying?
I spoke to him right in front of you. Didn’t you hear it?
I heard what you said. Tell me what he said!
he couldn’t be happier!
After all, it was always his wish to make Shebi his son in law.
Don’t do this.
What do you guys think?
That Shahab is happy with this decision?
Not at all!
He has only agreed to this marriage due to the emotional state he is in and nothing else!
Don’t ruin his life!
Listen, Chanda!
You don’t worry about his life.
He’s my son, I know him
He makes sure he gets whatever his heart wishes for.
And when he’s over it, he throws it away. Like he threw you.
Alright. Absolutely right.
Let them come, whoever wants to!
I’ll treat them in a way that they’ll remember for the rest of their lives!
Bravo!
There won’t be a need for that because you won’t come in front of them. Come!
What are you doing? Leave me!
Shut up!
Leave me! What are you doing? What are you doing? I won’t go! Leave me!
I say, come!
Leave me!
Leave me! Where are you taking me?
Sit!
Until the girl’s family doesn’t say yes and leave,
you’ll live here only! v
Alright?
Where are you going? Where are you guys going?
Enough!
I want to get out….
Move!
I want to get out! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Open the door. Open the door! Open the door.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Sitara?
So you’re leaving tomorrow?
Yes.
Take good care of yourself.
Live properly.
Have food on time
Don’t stay out late at night.
For you.
Anyway, I’m not going there forever but who knows?
I might not be able to bear the distance once I’m there
and I might come back for you?
But until then, you look at this and miss me.
I don’t need anything to miss you.
You asked for a treat so I had to give something to you.
How do you like it?
This…
Take a lot of care of yourself, Sitara.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, forgive me!
Forgive me, Mom!
Dad!
Dad, come back!
You Chanda is very lonely.
Come back!
Dad! Dad,
where did you go?
Why can’t you hear your Chanda’s voice?
Please come back, dad!
Water!
yes, sister in law?
Muraad, I want to talk to Chanda!
The number that I call on is going off.
Alright. I’ll send you the number I contact her on.
Hurry! Hurry up!
Alright. Whatever your wish may be.
Whose phone is it that’s ringing?
Who is this calling her?
Hello?
Chanda?
I know you’re upset with me.
I know of the torture that is being done to you.
Muraad has told me everything.
I wish to come running to you.
Your brother doesn’t let me come so what do I do?
Make me hear your voice just once.
Chanda, my child. At least say something!
Hello? Hello Chanda?
Chanda! Chanda! Chanda!
I am fed up with Chanda's name! Misery!
Why have you switched off your phone
Hello?
Is everything alright? You seem very happy today.
Oh, Bheeru! If I could, I would dance!
My son is going to Dubai! Dubai!
And you just see, he’ll send Dirhams for his dad from Dubai!
Dirham on dirham! Dirham on dirham!
I’ve heard Dubai is a very happening place?
If your son calls you there then it’s all fun for you. All fun!
Oh, come on. Let it be.
Dubai and Muraad brother?
What does he have to do over there?
Now tell me. He talks rubbish just like his face!
He’s my son. Mine!
Muraad’s son! He can’t live a day without me. You’ll see.
One day he’s going to call me to Dubai
and I’m not going to play gambling with you poor people after that!
What do they call it in English? Casino!
Muraad is going to gamble in a casino! Casino!
Casino! Casino!
One, he’s poor. And then a gambler!
Wajid Sahib, my wife, Erum.
Our daughter in law is very lovely.
Here you go, my child. This is a small present from my side.
What was the need for that?
Oh, why not?
This is a tradition too and we have got to celebrate it, right?
Thank you!
And uncle, mine?
How can I forget about you? Here you go. Your chocolates!
I’ll just be back from the kitchen.
Wajid Sahib, you please sit. Please be comfortable.
And sister in law? Is everything alright at home?
Yes. With Allah’s grace.
By the way, it’s nice that Babar’s wife has come.
Now we can see some happiness in the house.
Otherwise after Mansoor’s demise, all we could see was sadness in this house.
Sadness everywhere!
yes, you’re right.
And? When are you starting your business?
very soon, if god wills. We’ll get the opening done from you only.
If God wills.
And? How is your father?
Yes, he’s absolutely fine with Allah’s grace.
You guys talk, I’ll…
Yes, you make arrangements for the dinner.
So Wajid Sahib, what I was saying is that the cloth….
Oh, Tara! Oh, where are you!
What happened? I’m here!
Where is Shebi! Where is Shebi!
I’m calling him since so long now, he isn’t picking up my phone…
Ikram is on his way. His daughter is coming. What will we tell them?
Oh god, what will we tell them?
You didn’t make the call? You didn’t make the call?
I’ll call him again! Oh, it’s the bell ringing!
Do I look fine?
yes, yes. Very nice. Go!
Come, my child.
Ikram!
Hello, aunty! How are you? Uncle! It’s been ages!
58.
How’s it going?
Let’s go!
How did you like the house, my child? It’s a new house.
You came to the old one, right?
Yes. It’s really nice, aunty.
Yeah, not bad.
So let’s go to the drawing room then. To the drawing room?
Come, come. Sit in the drawing room.
Long time!
Yes, very!
Long time!
Bravo! I enjoyed having home cooked food after many days!
By the way sister in law, biryani made by you was outstanding! It’s delicious!
And now if we get to have tea made by Sitara then it’ll be just perfect!
I’ll just go and call dad. He hasn’t come yet.
Yes.
