Mom, what happened? You’re still here?
What will we do by going there?
Chanda’s mother called,
she refused to the proposal.
What? What? What? What flaw does my son have?
We went to their house to ask the hand of their daughter for our son,
we gave them respect instead they embarrassed us, they insulted Ghafoor the counselor! Shebi!
Mama, what happened? Why did she refuse?
What happened after all? I don’t understand anything.
I don’t know son but if you’ll ask me I’ll go and beg them for you..
Hello?
Your mother has refused.
What?
What happened? Whose call was it?
It was Zehra, I had told her to find a suitable match for Chanda.
Did she recommend anyone?
How is that possible?
That is what has happened?
Your mother has called my mama and insulted her by refusing, my mama and my baba.
Chanda I cannot bear that, I’m telling you.
Why are you getting angry? Everything will be fine. I’ll call you back. Okay?
Mom, what did you do?
What happened?
Do you not understand? I’ve made you understand so many times.
Look at the way you’re speaking to your mother
Let it be, this is between us only
No no, one minute. Nothing is private! Look at the way you’re talking, apologize!
Dad, I’m only asking mom to..
I’ll listen to everything you have to say but after you apologize, apologize right now!
Mansoor I told you to let it go.
Your tea has gotten cold, I’ll bring you some more. Chanda come with me.
There is a limit! The children are getting out of control.
You still haven’t called Chanda.
Fine, if this is how it will be then fine. Your mother has refused right? Fine.
She insulted my mama and baba, now I’ll also see to how this marriage won’t happen.
This marriage will happen Chanda.
Making you mine has become my ego problem now Chanda.
Try and get away.
I know, I clearly know why you refused. Why you said no, you couldn’t take it right..
Chanda, listen to me..
Give me the answer to my question, why did you refuse?
I felt as if those people weren’t right for you..
Really? You decided yourself that they’re not nice. Did you talk to dad?
Dad knows and recognizes people far more better than you! Why did you refuse?
What has happened? Stop it. Don’t misbehave so much!
I can do a lot more than misbehave..
What are you doing?
You don’t know me.
Who are you calling?
Hello?
Chanda..
Shahab,
my mother insulted your parent’s right?
She will come to your house and apologize to them, today!
Have you gone mad?
Yes! Yes I have gone mad!
And I can do much worse than this. Go and handle the situation and talk to dad!
Why aren’t you understanding?
You are not understanding what I’m saying. What is wrong with you?
And please for the love of god, don’t cry in front of me, this won’t help. Go and talk to them,
go to their house today and talk to dad!
Otherwise I hope I don’t run away with Shahab and get married while you keep staring at me like this!
Stop it! I will break your face if you talk anymore nonsense! I will strangle you!
What is it? Why was she shouting at you so much?
There is nothing like that. This always goes on..
No, I should know about everything.
You scolded her with so much anger. You know how much she minds, she’s your dearest.
If she’s my dearest that doesn’t mean I’m supposed to bear her misbehavior and disobedience.
What was she saying? Did she apologize after that?
She apologized, we hugged it out. Everything is fine.
Tell me about Babar, where is he? Did you speak to him? All my attention is on him.
He’s on his way, he’s coming. Where is Zain?
Zain is at his tuition. He was asking for his tuition fee.
Yes, here you go..
This is a lot of money.
Keep the money you need and keep the rest in our savings.
I can’t tolerate your insult. I’ve spoken to Chanda.
She has taken a stand and her mother will come here, she will apologize to the both of you.
Let it be son..
I can’t let it go, it’s the matter of my ego now!
Son,
don’t waste your time getting tangled with such people
in fact I would suggest you talking to Mr. Waqar about Shebi’s marriage with his daughter
Yes.. If I’ll talk to him it’s not like he would refuse, he will get his daughter married to him happily.
Son, you’ve met the girl right? She’s educated, she’s beautiful, she belongs to a wealthy family.
Son, forget about Chanda, marry her..
What are you thinking about? Call him, call him right now.
Yes..
No dad,
first off Chanda..
And mama you’ll see her mother will come to this house and apologize to you, I’m telling you.
Do you know, mom slapped me today for the first time..
There’s a limit. Why don’t you talk to your father?
I don’t have that much courage..
You say that you’re his dearest, he listens to you everything you say..
Yes he does and I can also convince him..
Then it’s settled. Hang up the phone and go and talk to him.
No no, not at all.
I can’t do that, I don’t have that much courage.
How can I discuss about my own marriage with him?
I’ll have to think of something else. I don’t have the courage Shahab, what do I do..
Listen do you have anyone in your family or friends who we can talk to?
Chanda has gone out fo control...
I will talk to Mansoor tomorrow
He will make her understand
What is it? Why are you awake? Are you worried about something?
I was thirsty. I woke up to drink water.
There is one person, my uncle. He listens to everything I say. We could talk to him..
Then that’s final. We’ll go to your uncle and talk to him.
You know how stubborn he is, he’s gotten persistent and now he’ll do what he wants.
I’ve been thinking about this all night..
Then what did you think off? What will we do?
We’ll have to do something..
Did you tell me or Shebi told me what work Chanda’s father is in?
He must have told us something, he must do some small business or something,
I don’t remember..
I’ll find out. I’ll go meet her father. I’ll talk to him..
Go and talk to them
Go to their place today only and talk to dad as well
Otherwise I hope I don’t run away with Shahab and get married while you keep staring at me like this!
Where is Chanda? She didn't have dinner neither she had breakfast
She hasn't even talked
She may not take any bold step
Uncle, mom is being stubborn. She’s not ready to tell dad. Tell us what to do..
She even called my parents and refused to the proposal.
Chanda said you could help us that’s why we’re here. Can you help us?
Chanda..
Chanda?
Chanda?
Chanda?
Chanda!
Chanda!
I don’t understand.. What do you guys want? What do I do?
Actually.. Uncle.. Can you talk to dad?
Look, even if I talk to him that would be of no use
because my sister in law has mishandled this situation
Then what do we do? We don’t know what to do. Help us please..
What’s wrong with you two?
You’re young, you can do whatever you want
and god has given you the right on making your own decisions
and honestly I am with you in both of your happiness
but I can’t stand by you openly that’s why go and get married right now.
Yes Mr. Mujtaba,
I understand but I’m leaving for my house right now.
It’s possible for me to meet you tomorrow. Sure sure..
You’re Mansoor right?
Can I talk to you later? Alright thank you.
Yes Asalam o alikum, my name is Mansoor.
Yes.. Control your daughter.
Ask her not to come near my son.
Who are you talk about my daughter?
My name is Ghafoor counselor!
I’m the counselor of my area.
I have a lot of power and sources and tell your daughter Chanda not to trap my son!
Enough!
I will not listen to anything against my daughter, do you understand?
Enough! There’s no need to show attitude here! I’ll make your and your daughter’s life miserable.
She’s my daughter,
she wouldn’t even give slight attention to thugs like you. Now get the hell out of here!
You don’t know me, my name is Ghafoor counselor.
Disgusting man!
Hello?
Hello? Babar?
Yes mom, what happened? What is it?
Come home soon. All hell has broke lose.
God help us..
Don’t say anything to your father, you just come home soon..
Uncle I’ll be back. Let me know when they come..
Chanda.. What happened?
What we’re doing is right, right?
I am with you right, everything is fine.
Are we doing something wrong?
Not at all. We wanted this right, to get married.
Yes..
Chanda..
Should I call him?
should I call him?
Yes..
Mom!
Babar..
What happened? You called me so suddenly, is everything okay?
Babar.. no everything is not okay.
Then tell me what has happened?
Chanda has disappeared..
Where can Chanda go mom?
I don’t know. I don’t know what has happened. I checked the whole house,
she isn’t anywhere. I don’t know where she has gone.
Then she must have gone to some friend of hers. Did you call her?
Yes, her phone was switched off. You try..
How can it be switched off?
Ask her to come home right now.
Did it connect? What happened?
Her number is actually switched off.
Yes, all of this happens because of you guys! You have given her so much freedom!
Oh god, what will happen now?
Don’t get too worried now..
Just find her wherever she is and bring her before your dad comes.
Fine I’ll bring her.. I’ll bring her..
Oh god, I hope a miracle happens and Chanda comes home soon
Chanda Mansoor daughter of Mansoor Ahmed,
do you accept Shadab Ghafoor son of Ghafoor Ahmed
with wedding gift of Rs. 2 lacs, in your marriage?
I’ll go to Aapi’s friends’ house, where she usually goes. The one who has a really big house.
I called and asked over there. She isn’t there either.
So she has so many friends, not just that one.
You give me any of her friends’ address, I’ll go and get her right away.
Your brother has gone to find sister. Just pray that he finds her and brings her back.
If we don’t find Chanda then I will…
Don’t ruin your health. You come and sit.
Go and get water from mother.
Shahab Ghafoor, son of Ghafoor Ahmed,
do you accept Chanda Mansoor, Bint e Mansoor Ahmed, with 2 lac as Dower, in your marriage?
Why are you ruining your health? She will be back. Stop worrying.
She has gone with the same guy. I know it.
I told you to say yes.
How could I have said yes?
That boy’s parents did not come to ask for a proposal.
They came to threaten and told me to call them while their son was around and refuse to the proposal.
Here, take this. Make mother drink the water.
Have water. Come on.
It won’t pass by my throat.
Have a sip. What’s wrong with you, mother? Have water.
Assalam o Alaikum, Muraad Chacha.
Walaikum a Salam, my child. How are you?
I am fine. And today, I am really happy.
Of course. My son’s wish is coming true.
Muraad Chacha, with your prayers, today, I have married Chanda.
Chanda!
Where is Chanda? I am asking, where is Chanda!
I don’t know.
Did you find out anything?
Um, I… looked for her at a lot of places. But I couldn’t find out anything.
Talk to Chanda.
Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
Oh, Walaikum a Salam, my princess daughter. You got married!
Anyway, it’s good. It’s very good.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to the both of you. May Allah Almighty always keep you two together.
Amen! We are coming to your place only right now.
Oh! Yes, yes. It is your own house only. You can come whenever you like. But…
But?
Look, my child. I think it isn’t appropriate for you to come over to my house right now.
My child, you should tell your parents first. And then go over to your in laws.
Then after that, whenever your heart says, you can come to your uncle's house.
My doors are always open for you.
Look, my child. You have to keep one thing in mind. There will be chaos.
But your parents must not find out at any cost
that I was the one who supported you in this matter.
You understand what I am saying, right? Right?
Yes,
I understand. And you are absolutely right.
This is what I should do.
Then I will come to you. Khuda Hafiz.
They got married.
Anyway,
it’s good. At least they got married.
What hell will it bring when brother and sister in law will find out about this!
Chanda, what was he saying?
Uncle was saying we should go to my parents first and then to yours.
What he’s saying is right. Let’s go.
Chanda right now, we cannot go to your house and neither to mine.
What does that mean?
Come with me.
The way that pathetic man spoke about my Chanda… If I could, I would’ve broken his face.
I don’t understand. After all, who those people were! What all was happening?
Our areas counsellor? He’s asking for Chandas proposal.
What? Why didn’t you tell me about this before?
Mansoor. Those people did not seem right to me at all. But…
But what, mother?
It was Chandas stubbornness that she would only get married over there.
Chanda.
You know it, right?
That we have to spend all of our lives together. We have to see every happiness together.
You will forget about everything. Didn’t you see? Our love was true. We got married.
Now tomorrow, we will go and meet your parents.
They will see us happy and forget about what happened today.
I hope that is what happens.
It will.
Look at me.
And now smile.
Now we’re married. Just once.
And listen, I have to go for an important work. I’ll be right back.
Where are you going? I am not going to stay here alone.
You aren’t a small child, right?
No. I am not going to stay here.
Chanda, I am telling you, right? I am coming back, okay?
Don’t go, please.
I will be right back.
Come back soon!
Lock the door.
Yes.
What happened? You look very furious?
Babar! Where are you going? Wait!
Assalam o Alaikum.
What happened, brother? Our Babar has left in a lot of anger.
Brother, is everything alright? Bhabhi is crying. What happened?
Forgive me
but this is all your fault. You ruined our family’s reputation in dust.
Muraad, she is my daughter. I can take care of her however I want, but I can take care of her.
Let it be, Bhabhi jee.
What did you have to handle? You should have gone to brother. You should have told him.
He would’ve handled it his way.
But Bhabhi jee, all your life,
you never gave my brother any respect. So, even now, you did exactly that.
I do give Mansoor…
What about me? What about me!
This is how you have trained them?
You have not left me in a position where I can show my face to the world.
Where will we go with whatever little respect we have left? Who will we go to?
I don’t understand where do I go? What do I do?
Bhai Sahib, what happened? Are you feeling alright?
Bhabhi jee, what are you looking at? Go and get water.
Everything will be alright. Have faith.
This is a test from Allah Almighty. If god wills, Allah will make everything alright.
Bhabhi jee, get the water already!
Chanda.
Where were you? I was waiting for you since so long. Do you know how scared I was?
I called you. You didn’t even take my call.
Chanda! Relax. What has happened to you?
Do you think I will leave you?
I have gotten married to you. I will be with you for the rest of my life.
Look. I went to buy you clothes.
What was the need for that?
There was. And… one more thing.
This is for you.
And Chanda, because we got married with such decency, that I could not do anything for you.
But this… This is our marriage’s first gift.
For my wife.
Did you like it?
It's very beautiful
You are beautiful
How dare that cheap man! What is his status that he would misbehave with you!
That cheap man, a gentleman innocent man!
He will have to face the consequences for the things he said.
I will tell Shebi, he will deal with him on his own.
Don’t you dare! You don’t have to tell Shebi.
I will tell Shebi about this in my own style.
And I will talk to him in a way that he won’t even look in that girls’ direction.
Then call him! Ask him to come.
Yes. Let me call him.
God knows what people my son has gotten himself associated with!
His number is going off. Did he tell you where he was going?
When does he ever tell me before going? He stays out all night.
Where is Shahab? Leave me! Where is Shahab? Shahab! Where is Shahab?
Where is Shahab? Where is he? Shahab!
Wait a minute! Who are you and what tone are you speaking in?
You will find out who I am and what tone I am speaking in. First let me get hold of my sister.
So what you are trying to say is that my son has kidnapped your sister?
Yes. He has brainwashed my sister.
He has shown her the wrong path. Where is my sister? Chanda! Chanda!
Oh! So you are Chandas brother?
Did your father not understand properly that he decided to send you over here?
I will get back to you later, on the way you mistreated my father.
Give me my sister back otherwise…
Otherwise what?
Otherwise, I will deal with you and your son in a way
that you won’t even be able to recognize each other.
I will…!
Where is my sister?
Stay away from me! Get out!
Where is my sister? Where is my sister, tell me?
Take him away!
Where is my sister, tell me! Where is she? Shahab!
He wanted to fix his characterless sister with my son! It’s good that my son got saved.
Tara…
Did Shebi kidnap his sister…
No, no! Shebi is not like that!
