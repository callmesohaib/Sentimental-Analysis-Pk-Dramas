[00:37] It was my fault that I went to meet Chanda.
[00:46] You shouldn’t have gone to meet her.
[00:50] You know she’s not feeling well. She’s expecting a baby.
[00:56] When we have don’t have any contact with api then how can we have any contact with her relations..
[01:04] A child’s relationship with her mother doesn’t end even after death.
[01:10] The children will be called out by the name of their mothers on the day of judgment.
[01:14] The children should think about that..
[01:19] If the children have hurt their mother and their mother is upset with them, then?
[01:25] Children make mistakes. A mother does get hurt but she forgives, she doesn’t stay upset.
[01:44] You have forgiven api, you’re not upset with her but brother and dad still are.
[01:57] You don’t worry, everything will be fine. Listen, Babar shouldn’t find about the Danish matter
[02:14] it would have been great if she would have been smart about it.
[02:27] Uncle, you’re with us so we don’t need anyone else
[02:33] and we won’t keep any contact with anyone else.
[02:37] Anyway, it’s getting late, mama and dad are waiting. Shall we go?
[02:43] Should I tell you something honestly?
[02:45] My home will become so empty after she leaves
[02:49] but you have to promise me something Shebi, you will take good care of my princess.
[02:57] Don’t worry uncle, I’ll treat her like a princess. She’ll rule in our house.
[03:06] God bless you. Stay happy. khud hafiz.
[03:11] And thank you so much.
[03:12] Your uncle’s doors will always be open for you.
[03:16] Khuda hafiz.
[03:28] So uncle, your expenses have ended then, find another way now.
[03:39] Welcome! Welcome! Come Shebi.
[03:43] Come, come. Bismillah! Bismillah!
[03:46] She has finally arrived at her own home.
[03:49] My sweet daughter in law, may God always keep you happy.
[03:54] Give me some money, I’ll caste off the evil eye.
[03:56] Yes, here you go..
[03:59] May God keep you away from the evil eye.
[04:02] May you always stay happy and keep my son happy as well.
[04:06] We had many dreams of doing a grand wedding
[04:10] but you two didn’t give us a chance. So your aunty did some arrangements and setting.
[04:16] Mama, thank you for all that you did.
[04:21] Look at that, you’re saying thank you to us? Great.
[04:25] All these clothes and jewelry are for you. Dress up nicely, look beautiful and stay happy.
[04:34] Will you just keep on chatting or will you arrange for some food?
[04:37] Yes of course. I’ve cooked everything myself today for my daughter in law.
[04:40] You cooked yourself? Shebi then let’s go out to eat.
[04:44] You’re too much! Shameem! Serve the food!
[04:48] Please Serve it Shameem!
[04:49] Shall I show you the jewelry? I got it made specially for you.
[05:32] Dad! Dad, what happened?
[05:34] Nothing son. I felt just a little dizzy.
[05:39] Why did you go to the office in this condition? You shouldn’t have.
[05:44] Who goes there to have fun? One has to go to work.
[05:49] That’s true dad but I’m here, I’ll handle the responsibility.
[05:52] You don’t go to the office for a few days, please rest.
[05:54] No, I’m fine. You don’t worry. I’ll rest for a while now, I’ll be fine by morning.
[06:01] Still.. you’re not taking care of your diet maybe. Come I’ll take you inside..
[06:04] I’ll go myself..
[06:05] Asalam o alikum. Shall I serve you dinner?
[06:15] You can’t even take care of dad now as well?
[06:18] When you could see he’s not well then why did you let him go to the office?
[06:22] Take care of his diet and what has happened?
[06:26] He was feeling absolutely fine till yesterday. Did something happen at home?
[06:31] Nothing has happened. He’ll have food, he’ll rest for a while and he’ll be fine. You also come..
[06:58] Open your eyes now..
[07:14] Chanda, how did you find your new home?
[07:26] It feels as if I’m dreaming.
[07:33] Dreaming with my eyes open and somebody might wake me up.
[07:48] One must learn how to turn dreams into reality from you.
[07:56] I am very lucky that you chose me, that you made me your companion.
[08:14] I wish mom could see me like this today,
[08:21] I wish she could see how much respect I got here
[08:29] only she could understand that Chanda’s decision was absolutely right
[08:35] but I feel sorry
[08:40] that she could never understand me. She always thought I was wrong.
[08:53] I don’t know Chanda but for some reason she though me and my family are wrong for you.
[09:03] She has really hurt my parents.
[09:08] And you saw how mama and dad gave you such a grand welcome for the sake of my love,
[09:19] they accepted you.
[09:23] I am very embarrassed.
[09:32] I apologize from their side..
[09:36] Chanda, what’s wrong? What are you doing?
[09:40] You’ll see when dad will find out everyone has accepted me and I’m living in this house now,
[09:51] he will come to apologize himself and mom will also apologize and everything will be fine.
[10:00] There will be no issue, no tension in our life anymore.
[10:11] Actually Chanda, I have made a promise to dad.
[10:17] What kind of promise?
[10:21] That after coming in this house, you can’t go to your parent’s house.
[10:29] You can’t keep any contact with anyone.
[10:33] This is your home now..
[10:44] Alright.
[10:47] I’ll keep no contact. You’ve done so much for me,
[10:52] I can do anything for you, I can cross every limit for you but if sometimes with dad…
[11:05] Not with anyone now.
[11:13] Only me, you and our home.
[11:48] Don’t be upset, please don’t be upset.
[11:52] You can scold me, you can hit me but don’t be upset with me please.
[11:57] Ask her to leave. I don’t want to speak to her.
[12:01] Mansoor, the poor thing is apologizing..
[12:05] Am I a child?
[12:07] Am I mentally unstable? Am I mad
[12:10] that you’re making me understand and I am not understanding?
[12:12] No no, I am not saying that.
[12:15] You won’t understand. I should go from here in fact leave the house.
[12:21] Mansoor! Mansoor!
[12:23] What?
[12:23] Where are you going?
[12:27] Sitara you go from here.
[12:36] Ask her to take all this.
[12:41] You go.
[13:20] Sister in law! Asalam o alikum.
[13:25] Walikum Salam. Is everything okay?
[13:26] Is brother at home?
[13:29] No, he’s out, he must be coming.
[13:31] I have brought good news for you.
[13:37] Mashallah Chanda’s in laws have accepted her, Shebi took her home.
[13:43] Oh God, thank you for listening to my prayers.
[13:47] Your prayers didn’t come in handy maybe
[13:52] but I think the hearts of the parents melted out of love for their son.
[14:04] I bought Chanda’s medicine from the store, the bill is only for 3 thousand rupees.
[14:12] You’re well aware of my financial position,
[14:14] it has become a problem for me to go by the store now.
[14:20] Muraad I don’t have any money right now.
[14:23] I’ll take it from him when he comes and I’ll drop them by your house.
[14:25] Oh no no, why should you bother?
[14:28] Besides Chanda is not there anymore. Let me know, I’ll come by and take them.
[14:38] Brother..
[14:39] I told you!
[14:41] I told you that Chanda is dead to us!
[14:43] Mansoor I..
[14:45] What are you saying? Chanda is our daughter..
[14:47] You!
[15:00] Mansoor what happened? What happened?
[15:01] Are you feeling okay?
[15:03] Get a hold of yourself! Mansoor!
[15:06] Mansoor! Mansoor please get up for the sake of God! Mansoor!
[15:18] You’re not only the daughter in law but also a daughter of this house.
[15:23] And we are very embarrassed for the pain we caused you.
[15:33] What are you saying?
[15:36] In fact I am embarrassed from the both of you.
[15:39] My family, my mother treated you so badly but you still accepted me..
[15:46] That is true but it’s okay.
[15:50] And mom, all these gifts just for your daughter in law? You won’t ask your son what he wants?
[15:54] What do you want? Tell me?
[15:56] What is Shebi saying?
[15:58] I’ll take the gift from you.
[16:09] Who is calling?
[16:12] Uncle, my uncle is calling..
[16:23] Should I pick it up?
[16:24] Yes sure.. talk.. talk to him..
[16:32] Asalam o alikum uncle.
[16:35] What is it? Why are you so worried?
[16:42] What? Dad suffered a heart attack?
[16:48] I’m coming. I am reaching right now.
[16:51] I have to go dad. We’ll have to go right now. Dad suffered a heart attack..
[16:56] Shebi! Shebi wait!
[16:57] Chanda!
[17:03] He went right after her. What we said was of no affect.
[17:09] It will get affected, it will get affected now..
[17:22] Uncle, where is dad? What happened to him?
[17:25] Is everything okay?
[17:28] Brother suffered a serious heart attack. The doctor is treating him.
[17:35] Pray nothing happens to my brother..
[17:39] Where is mom?
[17:43] This way..
[17:52] Mom.
[17:56] What happened to dad? Why do you guys not tell me anything ever?
[17:59] Why do you hide everything from me? Why did you bring him to the hospital?
[18:01] Nothing has happened..
[18:02] If nothing has happened then… God forbid if something happens to dad then…
[18:06] Nothing will happen to dad. Nothing will happen to him.
[18:09] He’s not well that’s why we have brought him to the hospital. He’ll be fine.
[18:13] Nothing is going to happen to him right?
[18:25] Uncle! Uncle! How is dad feeling?
[18:28] Where are you going?
[18:29] I want to see him!
[18:29] How dare you come here?
[18:30] I want to see dad! I want to see dad!
[18:32] Don’t call him dad with this dirty language of yours!
[18:35] He is my father too! You move from here! Move!
[18:38] For god sake, just tell us how uncle’s health is?
[18:42] I should tell the two of you? My father is in this condition today, only because of you two!
[18:46] Go from here, otherwise…
[18:47] Babar!
[18:47] Otherwise what? What will you do?
[18:49] Chanda, for god sake! Babar Bhai is very furious right now…
[18:52] So what if he’s angry? What do I do? He’s my father!
[18:54] He isn’t feeling well! But no one is letting me go to him!
[18:57] Babar! What are you doing!
[18:59] I am telling you! Send him away from here!
[19:02] Take me where? Take me where!
[19:06] Uncle, I want to see dad… He is my father too!
[19:08] I want to see him once! I want to see him just once!
[19:12] Enough! Enough! I say come with me!
[19:17] Uncle, just let me meet him once… Dad!
[19:24] What, did Chanda come? I heard her voice. Where is she, where did she go?
[19:27] You’re still concerned about her? Dad fell sick the one time she had come. I’m sure she must’ve done something this time too! Tell me, right now!
[19:29] Dad fell sick the one time she had come.
[19:32] I’m sure she must’ve done something this time too! Tell me, right now!
[19:34] Tell me right now! What happened? What did Chanda do!
[19:37] Chanda didn’t do anything, Babar. Actually, your uncle…
[19:42] Excuse me.
[19:49] Doctor! Dad is fine, right?
[19:52] Sorry. We couldn’t save him.
[20:21] What is up with this guard?
[20:26] I would’ve been able to meet dad if you hadn’t fought with Babar Bhai today.
[20:31] What? You think that I fought with Babar?
[20:36] He may hit me, push me. All of that is okay?
[20:39] I should bow down in front of him and keep listening?
[20:42] And what is my fault? That I committed the sin of marrying you? That’s it?
[20:47] That is not what I meant.
[20:49] What did you mean then? Tell me!
[20:52] I would’ve gotten some satisfaction if I had seen dad or met him.
[20:56] Chanda, you are well aware of our house’s situation, right?
[21:00] Didn’t I take you to the hospital even though mom and dad were against it?
[21:03] Yes, you took me but I still couldn’t meet dad.
[21:11] I don’t get you!
[21:14] Alright. You can go if you want to see your dad.
[21:19] Go all you want. You have full permission from my side!
[22:16] Mansoor.
[22:21] Mansoor.
[22:23] Wake up!
[22:27] Wake up! You know what?
[22:30] Chanda has come to meet you.
[22:35] Everyone is waiting for you outside. Nothing has happened to you.
[22:41] You’re just a little unwell. You will be fine.
[22:46] Wake up, please.
[22:51] Mansoor!
[22:59] I can’t live without you.
[23:04] What will I do? Don’t leave me alone.
[23:10] I can’t live without you. Wake up!
[23:24] Nothing has happened to you. You just have a little temperature, that’s it. I’ll go call someone.
[23:35] Babar! Babar!
[23:41] Babar, go and call Chanda. You know? Dad’s missing her.
[23:46] Nothing has happened. He’s just unconscious because of the operation.
[23:49] He’ll come back to his senses right now.
[23:50] You go and bring Zain and Sitara too. Don’t… Don’t do this. Listen to me!
[23:53] Mom! At least listen to me.
[23:55] Listen to me. He would want to see everyone when he becomes conscious, right!
[23:58] Mom, no. Listen to me. Dad is no longer alive! He is dead, mom.
[24:01] Don’t talk rubbish!
[24:08] Try to understand, mom.
[24:10] Mom!
[24:12] Mom!
[24:13] Mom, what happened?
[24:14] Go and bring water! Water! Go and get water, fast!
[24:16] Mom! Mom!
[24:41] That wasn’t nice.
[24:45] The way you left without asking for our permission.
[24:49] Our house’s women can’t even think of doing that.
[24:56] We aren’t heartless! We don’t have a heart of stone.
[25:02] We do sympathize with your father.
[25:06] You do sympathize with a patient.
[25:09] But what about the insult that he has caused to this house?
[25:14] You are this house’s member now. Think of here too!
[25:20] A lot!
[25:23] We have bared a lot for the two of you. But…
[25:33] Let me talk…
[25:35] Not right now!
[25:37] There’s a limit to how much we can take!
[25:49] Just so your relationship doesn’t suffer,
[25:51] we made the decision of asking for the promise from you two to never keep any contact with them.
[25:58] The ones who don’t care about your relationship or your life. They’re just patients of their ego.
[26:06] Mama. Baba.
[26:10] We are very embarrassed for whatever happened today.
[26:17] And we promise to you that you won’t get a reason to complain again after today.
[26:24] Am I right,
[26:27] Chanda?
[26:30] Chanda!
[26:31] What am I saying?
[26:33] What…
[26:43] No one will pick up the phone.
[26:45] Let me just talk to him once?
[26:47] Don’t pick up the phone if you want to live in this house.
[26:58] Hello! What is this, why are you calling again and again…..
[27:03] What!
[27:04] Let me talk! Hello?
[27:09] What!
[27:15] Dad is no more?
[27:19] Dad has left.
[27:20] Chanda.
[27:21] Dad is no more. Dad has left.
[27:23] Chanda,
[27:25] get hold of yourself.
[27:25] Dad!
[27:27] Chanda. Chanda. Chanda!
[27:29] Chanda!
[27:30] Chanda!
[27:31] Chanda!
[27:33] Dad, look at her. Chanda, come to your senses. Chanda!
[28:25] No. No, Danish. No. I can’t see my brother’s face.
[28:33] I can’t see my dead brother’s face! I can’t see his funeral!
[28:37] Pull yourself together, dad.
[28:39] How do I pull myself together?
[28:41] He! All my life, my brother took care of me.
[28:46] The one who held me has left himself! How do I pull myself together!
[28:51] Danish! You don’t know
[28:55] how much pain my brother has seen before dying!
[28:58] I wish!
[29:01] I wish brother hadn’t fought with sister in law before dying!
[29:06] I wish Chanda hadn’t misbehaved with my brother because dying!
[29:11] So then today my brother would’ve been alive!
[29:14] I have become an orphan now!
[29:17] I have become an orphan! I have become an orphan! I have become an orphan! An orphan!
[29:25] What happened?
[29:26] I have become an orphan!
[29:27] Go and bring water.
[29:28] Nothing is left!
[29:30] Uncle, have courage. Who’s going to look after us if you don’t show courage?
[29:33] Babar! You don’t know!
[29:36] Brother had a very serious fight with sister in law before dying!
[29:43] Brother felt pain over here and then he fell.
[29:46] I wish! I wish that fight hadn’t taken place.
[29:49] I wish that Chanda hadn’t done all of that. Then your father would’ve been alive today!
[29:53] I wish that this mannerlessness hadn’t taken place today. This is all Chanda’s fault!
[29:58] Sister in law had a fight with brother. Brother felt the pain and he fell! My brother is dead!
[30:08] Chanda! What is this that you have done! What did you do, Chanda!
[30:37] She’s unconscious right now.
[30:38] But what if she forces again on going home once she’s back to her senses, then?
[30:43] You talk in senses. I think you are unconscious
[30:47] Should I put my generation at stake and send her at the funeral?
[30:51] No! This will not happen
[30:54] Look, you have done what you wanted to but I won't let this happen.
[31:06] Look, Shebi. We care so much about you. Don’t you care about your child?
[31:11] Alright. If you can take the guarantee that nothing would happen to her, then take her.
[31:16] Whatever influence it might have on her then. Okay!
[31:18] No! Son, anyway they say that if you take them to a funeral in this condition
[31:21] then the ghosts get into your body.
[31:23] And then in life, your brain stops working! You lose control of yourself!
[31:30] What rubbish are you talking?
[31:34] No, brother, no! Be a man, my child! Be a man!
[31:39] But no! You will anyway do as you wish.
[31:44] Alright then. It’s his child. He understands better. Do whatever you like.
[31:48] Alright.
[31:53] Shebi! Don’t get worried. We are here, right? We are outside only. Okay?
[32:19] Son, I can’t take this!
[32:21] Pull yourself together, dad.
[32:22] How do I pull myself together?
[32:23] Wajid Bhai! He was my father! I have become an orphan today!
[32:29] Have patience. Have patience.
[32:31] I have become an orphan, Wajid Bhai!
[32:34] I have become an orphan! How will I take care of myself?
[32:39] It has gotten late. We should get going. Let’s go. Go inform inside. Come.
[32:51] No, Wajid Bhai! I have become an orphan!
[32:55] Everybody has to go. You have some courage.
[32:57] How do I show courage? Bhai Sahib! Who have you left me with! Bhai Sahib!
[33:11] Dad!
[33:20] Dad!
[33:22] Dad!
[33:23] Did dad call me? Is he asking for me? Move!
[33:26] He is calling me!
[33:28] Chanda, listen to me!
[33:29] I want to go to Dad! I want to go to Dad!
[33:33] You didn’t let me go to dad, right? I want to go to my dad, he’s calling me! Don’t you understand!
[33:37] Chanda!
[33:40] Dad!
[33:41] Pull yourself together!
[33:43] Dad!
[33:47] Dad!
[34:03] No, no, no, no, no!
[34:06] Have patience, my child. Have patience.
[34:08] No, no, no. Please, no! No! No!
[34:23] Someone stop them! No! No, brother, no! Please don’t take him! Mom!
[34:58] Where are you taking my father? Where are you taking my father?
[35:16] Mom didn’t even meet him!
[35:22] I can’t live without him! My mom…. Mom! Mom!
[35:26] Mom!
[35:29] They took dad! You do something! Why are you standing like this?
[35:34] Mom, do something! Mom! Mom! Mom! Do something!
[36:06] I want to go to dad!
[36:08] Chanda!
[36:08] How can dad leave me like this?
[36:09] Chanda, what has happened! Where are you going!
[36:10] I want to go to dad. I want to see his face for the last time. I have to ask for forgiveness from him!
[36:13] What has happened to you? We can’t go!
[36:16] Why can’t we go!
[36:17] Have you forgotten? We made a promise to mama and baba!
[36:20] It’s my dad’s funeral over there and you care about your promise!
[36:23] Chanda, please! Please, try to understand.
[36:25] You try to understand! Let me go.
[36:31] I want to see dad’s face for the last time,  ask for forgiveness.
[36:33] I couldn’t even see his face! I won’t go ever again! Let me just go to dad right now…
[36:37] Chanda. You can’t go!
[36:40] Why can’t I go?
[36:43] Because it’s not right for a woman to go to a funeral in this condition…
[36:47] I don’t believe in such things! I want to go! That’s it!
[36:50] You can’t go!
[36:51] Why can’t I go! If it was your dad’s funeral instead of mine, what would you have done?
[36:56] Shut up!
