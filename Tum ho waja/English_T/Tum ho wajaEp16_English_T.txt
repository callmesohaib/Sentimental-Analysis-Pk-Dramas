[00:34] So you took so much time in the market only?
[00:40] Yes, like I said it was very crowded.
[00:44] If it was so crowded and you had gone to get grocery
[00:46] then where is the grocery you bought? You didn’t bring it?
[00:53] Do you know what happened, two people fought so I panicked and left the stuff there only.
[00:59] That’s okay. I’ll send Zain, he’ll bring it.
[01:03] Don’t send Zain..
[01:05] So should we leave the stuff there only?
[01:08] I told you, people fought and the police so it’s not right sending him there. I’ll bring it tomorrow.
[01:14] Alright sure.
[01:19] I’ll go check on lunch, make some lentil soup..
[01:25] Sitara must have made the lentil soup. You relax, drink water.
[01:42] Mama tell me, what discussion did all of you have?
[01:45] There was no discussion..
[01:46] Something has definitely happened, you’re hiding it from me.
[01:49] Shebi what will I hide from you and why will I hide it?
[01:52] I should also know what happened when Chanda’s mother came here.
[01:59] I can’t tell you..
[02:01] Fine, if you can’t tell me then I will call dad myself and..
[02:03] No! Don’t call your father..
[02:09] Why?
[02:13] Because he’s very angry..
[02:18] That means she came here and created a scene.
[02:23] I don’t understand why she has so much arrogance..
[02:28] Son..
[02:31] I had tried my best to cool down the situation.
[02:35] I had also convinced your father not to get angry that when they’ll come to apologize.
[02:47] I don’t know what they want..
[02:52] Usually the girl’s family always keep their head down.
[02:58] That woman was looking straight into your father’s eyes while speaking..
[03:05] What? Then what happened?
[03:10] Then what would have happened? You know about your father’s anger..
[03:17] What does Chanda’s mother want after all..
[03:22] Shebi.. son, if you ask me then don’t discuss them for a few days at home..
[03:34] Shebi! Where are you going?
[03:41] There will he go? To that Chanda? He has to come back here only..
[04:06] Chanda.. Is everything okay? Why are you so worried?
[04:11] Can you take me to Shahab’s house?
[04:13] Shahab.. how can I take you to Shahab’s house right?
[04:17] What do you mean how? We’ll come back early..
[04:20] First tell me what has happened?
[04:25] Mom has gone to meet Shahab’s parents and I am unable to find out what happened there.
[04:30] Chanda please don’t worry. Everything will be fine..
[04:35] No Danish..
[04:37] I can feel a very big storm coming behind this silence..
[04:40] I think something bad is about to happen..
[04:44] Okay you can’t go to Shahab’s house but you can go to my house right?
[04:49] Go check if mom is back or not and if she’s back then find out what happened there?
[04:53] I want to know.. I am very tensed! I don’t know what have happened there!
[04:58] Alright, I’ll go.. Dad is also here..
[05:10] Babar, it’s you..
[05:22] Babar, you didn’t go to work today ?
[05:26] No. I didn’t feel like it.
[05:29] You look quite angry today..
[05:31] What do I do other than being angry?
[05:34] I will not be at peace until I don’t kill that Shebi!
[05:38] What’s wrong Babar? Why are you saying such emotional things?
[05:43] Why shouldn’t I?
[05:44] You tell me, what should I do?
[05:46] Someone comes in and disrespects us like that and I should just keep sitting idly?
[05:51] Babar will you get back your respect and peace by killing someone?
[05:55] Yes I will get it back! And I didn’t come here to listen to your lecture.
[06:00] If I wanted to talk about this then I could’ve done it back home with mom and dad
[06:03] but I know they will never understand what I’m saying.
[06:06] I came to you because you would listen and understand..
[06:19] Don’t say that.. He’ll die..
[06:20] Then he can die! Hasn’t he died yet?
[06:22] His daughter ran away and he’s roaming around alive, shameless man!
[06:30] Mom I’ve ironed dad’s clothes, tell me if I also have to iron yours.
[06:33] No, let it be..
[06:36] Mom? Look here.. you’re crying. What has happened?
[06:41] Nothing. You go and study, your exams are around the corner. Let this be..
[06:46] I will do all of that. You tell me what has happened to you?
[06:50] Nothing has happened..
[06:52] Someone has defiantly said something which has caused you pain.
[06:57] Did someone hurt you?
[07:02] Mom, tell me I’m worried.
[07:05] What has happened to you?
[07:08] Mom, don’t get worried. Everything will be fine Inshallah.
[07:13] Mom..
[07:31] Rash decisions only cause more problems for ourselves
[07:35] and you know uncle and aunty’s condition as well.
[07:39] They won’t be able to bear if their young son gets prisoned for murder under these circumstances.
[07:45] Then what do you expect of me? That I wear bangles and sit at home?
[07:50] Babar, have patience..
[07:52] I won’t be able to stay patient. Once I get my hands-on Chanda, I won’t spare her.
[08:14] Asalam o alikum uncle.
[08:16] Walikum Salam. When did you come?
[08:19] I just came, I’m leaving now..
[08:22] Is everything okay? You look quiet angry..
[08:24] What do I do other than being angry?
[08:26] You know what Chanda has done, she has embarrassed us.
[08:31] You’re right.. I myself am hiding my face from people these days.
[08:41] Look..
[08:42] People will be one’s looking now. I’m leaving, khuda hafiz..
[08:52] Did he see her?
[08:55] No..
[09:01] Did he leave?
[09:03] Yes. Chanda I need to talk to you about something very important
[09:07] Sure, what is it?.
[09:11] One minute..
[09:19] Hello? Where are you?
[09:21] I’ve been calling you since so long, you’re not answering nor are you talking to me.
[09:24] What happened? What did they talk about?
[09:30] Okay, I’ll be ready.
[09:40] Uncle, I’ll have to go now..
[09:44] Where?
[09:45] Where is he taking you?
[09:48] I don’t know. He asked me to get ready, he’s coming to pick me up.
[09:54] I’ll talk to you when I get back.
[09:57] Be careful when you leave, I mean to say hide your face..
[10:00] Nobody should know that you’re here.
[10:02] Of course. You don’t worry. I’ll be careful.
[10:24] Dad whatever is happening is wrong and I’m losing my patience.
[10:30] By hearing what Babar said, his intentions don’t sound good to me.
[10:34] You know how short tempered he is.
[10:36] If he even gets a clue that Chanda is here then you know what will happen right..
[10:41] Nothing will go wrong. Nothing will go wrong. You don’t worry.
[10:49] I’m going to Chanda’s house and I’ll tell everyone the truth..
[10:53] What? Who will you tell? Chanda’s mother came here herself, she knows Chanda’s here.
[11:08] She’ll tell everyone when she wants to and listen to me Danish, don’t interfere in the matters of adults.
[11:16] Go, go right now and check how are the conditions there and come back and tell me.
[11:21] Go on,
[11:24] Go! nothing will go wrong.
[11:51] What has happened?
[11:55] You didn’t say a word during the whole ride. You also ate quietly.
[12:01] Say something to me please..
[12:04] I’m getting very agitated. Tell me, what is it? Why aren’t you saying anything?
[12:08] What do I tell you?
[12:10] What do I say to you?
[12:12] I’m sometimes not sure if you are even your mother’s own daughter or her step daughter
[12:17] because mothers don’t even treat their step daughters the way your mother treats you.
[12:25] What? Has she done something wrong again?
[12:29] What else can be expected of her?
[12:33] I had told you that it’s not appropriate for her to come to my house alone.
[12:39] She spoke to my father looking straight into his eyes,
[12:43] nobody has ever had the courage to do that.
[12:48] Where are you going?
[12:49] Let me go!
[12:50] But where are you going?
[12:51] I have to go! I have to question her, the one has made our life hell!
[12:57] You have gone mad.
[12:59] Right now everyone is against us, we’ll have to handle the matter with patience
[13:05] Okay fine. Let’s let go of everything, I’ll come with you to your house.
[13:10] We’ll see what happens, at least take me there. You don’t even take me..
[13:13] You can’t come with me to my house, how many times do I explain it to you?
[13:19] You have me, I will fix everything. Listen to me, that’s final.
[13:33] Bill please..
[13:35] What had to happen has happened. It’ll be better if you’ll try to forget.
[13:41] You’re right.
[13:45] If problems are dealt with patience then problems go away
[13:52] because patience is the biggest weapon a person can have
[13:56] and that’s when better conclusions can be expected.
[13:59] These days at our house also..
[14:00] Mansoor it’s time for your Namaz.
[14:06] Yes, I’ll go say my prayer. You keep sitting..
[14:09] Sure..
[14:23] Danish, for the love of god don’t discuss Chanda with anyone here.
[14:28] I know aunty, you don’t worry.
[14:31] I just came to know when you went to Chanda’s house then what happened there?
[14:39] Nothing happened there..
[14:40] Chanda is very worried aunty. Please tell me clearly what happened there..
[14:47] Just tell her that I pleaded and begged them but
[14:54] they are stern on the fact that the matter will go forward if Mansoor comes and apologizes
[15:03] They’re such odd people.
[15:05] This condition clearly shows that they want to put you all down and nothing else.
[15:09] Obviously.
[15:12] Danish I’m very worried staying alone like this,
[15:16] Meeting them would be another story, Mansoor doesn’t even want to talk about Chanda.
[15:22] Aunty, I would advice you not to come and meet Chanda until this matter cools down.
[15:34] If anyone finds out that Chanda is at our house
[15:37] and you come to meet her there then you’ll have to face more problems.
[15:47] Was Shebi angry?
[15:50] He was quite angry.
[15:54] What was he saying?
[15:59] He kept asking questions. He wanted to know after all what did that girl’s mother say to us.
[16:06] What did you tell him?
[16:09] I tried my best not to say anything
[16:11] but when he was about to call you then I stopped him. I exaggerated a few things and told him.
[16:18] He was getting quite angry on the girl’s mother, he must have scolded his wife quiet well.
[16:23] Good. You did the right thing.
[16:29] How was he looking?
[16:33] Shebi is very worried, he has a lot gotten very weak.
[16:39] Listen, we won’t be strict with him anymore.
[16:44] Let him do whatever he likes, however he feels like besides this issue.
[16:50] You understand what I’m saying right?
[16:51] Alright
[17:05] What happened? Are you worried?
[17:09] You’re the one who looks worried
[17:12] Not really.
[17:14] What was mom saying?
[17:16] First get rid of this worried look from your face.
[17:18] I get bothered seeing a worried look on your innocent sweet face. Please relax..
[17:24] Who can relax in these conditions?
[17:27] I can’t change the conditions or what Chanda did
[17:34] but I’ll try to keep this house and you away from these problems
[17:41] but I’ll need your support for this Sitara
[17:43] First tell me was mom talking about api? What were you consoling her about?
[17:49] All I can do is console her after what Chanda did
[17:56] but remember that you’re the one who is important for me, the most important
[18:20] I find the taste of the water also bitter now.
[18:22] You’re eating medicine so your taste has also gone bad.
[18:27] Go check..
[18:27] I’ll check..
[18:29] Here you go..
[18:34] Asalam o alikum..
[18:36] Asalam o alikum.
[18:38] Oh Mr. Mansoor, keep sitting please.
[18:40] How are you?
[18:41] I’m absolutely fine. I just came here to give you some fruits..
[18:47] You bothered yourself for no reason..
[18:49] There’s no formality in love, there are only blessings in love.
[18:54] Thank you so much.
[18:55] I actually got this fruit for my sister in law and you. You’ll have to cut it for him
[19:00] otherwise he won’t eat it himself. Okay?
[19:03] No no, you’ve got them with so much love. I will definetly eat them
[19:09] Mr. Majid has come, Sahiba tea..
[19:11] No tea please. I’m in a rush so I’ll leave. I’ll come again.. Take good care of yourself.
[19:18] Please do make him have the fruit.
[19:24] Thank you so much.
[19:25] Take care of yourself.
[19:38] He’s such great man! We don’t find such people these days.
[19:43] People have masks over their faces, Mansoor.
[19:49] What do you mean?
[19:52] You may say anything but I feel that this man is not what he pretends to be.
[19:58] Sahiba!
[19:58] And I have told you this be before as well that I don’t like him coming over at our house all the time!
[20:02] His intentions aren’t good.
[20:05] He has a lot of respect in his eyes for me.
[20:09] He is my boss and I am his worker, yet he feels for me and respects me.
[20:15] But Mansoor, I…
[20:16] I don’t know why you have issues with this man.
[20:21] He is such a big man but even then, he comes to check on us.
[20:24] At a time where even our relatives leave us and turn their backs on us.
[20:27] He never even comes empty handed. He always brings something or the other for the kids.
[20:35] I don’t know what has happened to you.
[20:38] Only God knows what’s in the heart and my heart says that…
[20:43] Let your heart be! If your heart had said something before,
[20:49] then your own daughter, Chanda, who lived inside these four walls with you,
[20:54] could not have deceived us.
[20:56] I’m also noticing how much you can see!
[20:59] Wouldn’t it have been better if you had looked after your own daughter the same way
[21:02] you’re noticing him?
[21:06] After today, I won’t hear a single word against Wajid Sahib. Do you understand that?
[21:29] Why, Uncle? Being a girl, I went against my mom and dad and got married secretly.
[21:36] But he can’t handle his parents even though he’s a guy?
[21:39] That’s it!
[21:40] I have had enough!
[21:41] I will go to his house tomorrow only and I will see what anyone can do!
[21:44] No! Not at all! You won’t do anything like that. And neither will I let you do anything like that.
[21:52] Why! Why shouldn’t I, Uncle?
[21:54] My child, because I have made a promise to Shebi
[21:57] that until he doesn’t resolve this issue properly, my daughter will live with me in this house.
[22:05] Yes, so alright! I have lived with you!
[22:07] But now, you will tell him that you cannot tolerate me in this house for another day!
[22:12] My child, how can I say that to him?
[22:14] What has happened to you, Uncle?
[22:17] You aren’t understanding!
[22:19] He is living over there very peacefully,
[22:22] he has no worries! He is only taking advantage of your love!
[22:28] He is making a fool out of the both of us!
[22:30] No, no, no. He isn’t making a fool out of anyone. Come here, come to me.
[22:33] You aren’t listening to what I’m saying!
[22:35] At least sit. Sit.
[22:36] I am telling the truth!
[22:37] Listen to me!
[22:40] Look, my child. Listen to me carefully.
[22:44] Look, you went against your parents.
[22:48] What’s done is done! But Shebi has to convince his parents.
[22:56] Chanda, you are the one who has to spend her life with them, in their house.
[23:03] That’s why for your happiness and peace, this is very important.
[23:07] For Shebi’s parents to accept you wholeheartedly.
[23:11] For that, you need to give him some time.
[23:15] You understand what I’m telling you, right?
[23:19] Look, my child. You don’t ever have to fight with Shebi.
[23:25] Chanda, once a man loses his interest in something and if he makes it about his ego
[23:32] and rigidness then he can ruin everything.  But Shebi is not like that.
[23:36] He’s very nice! He loves you a lot!
[23:39] And that’s why you have to keep showing your tears in front of him.
[23:47] So that his heart keeps melting for you.
[23:54] You will do that, right? You will care about your uncle’s respect, right?
[24:00] Good!
[24:10] What an ill-mannered and arrogant girl she is.
[24:18] Muraad Sahib, she can cause trouble for you if you mess with her.
[24:23] That’s why you need to control your anger.
[25:04] I don’t want to have this. I wanted to have tea.
[25:09] You have been consuming tea since morning. You haven’t even had food. I am getting worried.
[25:16] Really? You care about me?
[25:20] What do you mean by that? Who else will care for you if I don’t?
[25:24] Alright.
[25:28] What happened?
[25:33] Sahiba, I can’t seem to recall if you have ever lied to me except for the Chanda matter.
[25:41] I have lied to you?
[25:46] Today, neither did you go to give the committee nor did you go to the market.
[25:51] So, where did you go?
[25:54] I went to the same place that I have told you about only.
[25:57] Another lie.
[26:00] As far as I remember, you have also never doubted on me like this before.
[26:07] Sahiba, don’t try to change the topic!
[26:11] What has happened to you?
[26:12] You went to meet Chanda today!
[26:16] No! Believe me, I did not go to meet her.
[26:24] These things that you’re saying, this lie that you’re telling, is hurting me!
[26:30] I keep breaking from inside! Don’t take any such step that leads to my death!
[26:50] I don’t want to talk to you or hear anything that you have to say!
[26:53] You will have to listen! It is very necessary that you hear what they spoke to Tayi Jaan about!
[26:56] Shahab has told me everything!
[26:59] What did Shahab tell you?
[27:00] Let it be, okay?
[27:01] I am already very furious after hearing about moms’ antics! My head is exploding out of pain!
[27:07] You... just go from here! I don’t want to argue with you on anything!
[27:09] Wait a minute. Tayi Jaan’s antics? I didn’t quite understand?
[27:13] I haven’t been able to understand that either till now!
[27:16] That after all, what problem does mom have with me? Why can’t she see me happy? Why!
[27:20] Chanda, Tayi Jaan only and only wants your happiness!
[27:22] That’s why she keeps pleading in front of Shebi’s mother to accept you! But those people…
[27:27] She’s lying. She’s lying!
[27:30] She doesn’t go over there to talk to them! She goes there so she can demean and insult them!
[27:35] Shebi said that to you?
[27:36] Yes!
[27:36] So what Shebi tells you is the truth? And what your mom tells you is a lie?
[27:40] Chanda, you’re the only girl in this world who trusts outsiders more than she trusts her own mother.
[27:45] Excuse me!
[27:47] He’s my husband, not some outsider! He is my own! Do you understand?
[27:51] Chanda, why don’t you understand that there is no relationship purer than that of you and your mother?
[27:54] What is this noise that you guys are making? What are you arguing on?
[27:58] I am not the one arguing, he is!
[28:00] Why?
[28:01] Dad, make her understand
[28:02] that there isn’t any relationship that’s more superior to that of you and your mothers!
[28:04] She thinks of this relationship as insignificant because of her ego and rigidness!
[28:08] She has never had any sense in her and neither is she ever going to have it!
[28:11] She has destroyed my life!
[28:13] You’re the one who has destroyed their lives!
[28:15] Hold on, one minute. Are you guys in your senses? You guys are fighting like maniacs!
[28:21] And what is the need for you to argue with her?
[28:24] Does she not have enough problems in her life that you’re also giving her this attitude?
[28:28] Dad, tell her not to talk to me about Tayi Jaan in this manner.
[28:33] This is between her and her mother. Why are you interfering?
[28:38] All my life, even I have never spoken in their matters. Who are you to interfere then?
[28:46] Chanda, my child. I have a request for you too.
[28:51] Look, you need to keep your anger is control too.
[28:54] Go… go to your room. I’ll deal with this. Go.
[29:01] What has happened to you?
[29:04] Does your brain even work?
[29:07] I have already told you to bear this for a few days
[29:10] and have control over your anger. But no! You want to argue.
[29:15] I had just gone to rest for two minutes but you have also made that impossible!
[29:26] Where is the mosquito repellent!
[29:33] Arshad! Give me a cigarette.
[29:37] Smoking Kills
[29:38] Since when have you started smoking, Babar?
[29:40] Smoking Kills
[29:41] I have. Just like that.
[29:43] Anyway, a person only smokes when he’s either too happy or when something’s bothering him.
[29:51] By the way, I can understand. I am sure, there is something that is bothering you.
[29:56] Well, it’s only fair after someone’s sister takes a step like that…
[29:59] What rubbish are you talking?
[30:02] Rubbish? Is it not true that your sister has run away from home?
[30:06] Oh! What did you say?
[30:08] Babar, I was just…
[30:09] What did you say? What…what did you say? What!
[30:14] Babar, I did not mean it that way.
[30:15] Let him go. He made a mistake.
[30:18] Make him understand! He will lose his life the next time!
[30:22] That is not what I meant…
[30:23] Shut up!
[30:25] Shut up!
[30:39] Who is it!
[30:42] What has happened? Is everything alright?
[30:51] By the way, it’s great! You guys are sleeping here so peacefully.
[30:59] Has anyone ever asked if I have been able to sleep peacefully these days or not?
[31:08] Because you guys have to stay at home.
[31:11] I am the one who has to go out and listen to people’s taunts.
[31:18] I don’t understand
[31:22] how me knocking on the door has disturbed everyone’s sleep here
[31:25] and not the rubbish that people have been talking.
[31:28] What is this way that you’re talking in? Have you gone mad?
[31:30] Yes, I have gone mad! I have lost my senses!
[31:36] I can no longer listen to the taunts people have to throw.
[31:39] And I only came here to tell you that we cannot live here anymore!
[31:44] We can’t live here? Where are we going to live if not here?
[31:47] Somewhere else. But we can’t stay in this area anymore.
[31:51] Are you even in your senses?
[31:53] Pull yourself together. Where will we go if we leave our own house?
[31:58] Alright. I have told you my decision and now it is up to you guys.
[32:05] But remember one thing.
[32:09] The circumstances that we are living in over here,
[32:13] I won’t be responsible if something happens from my hands.
[32:19] You guys will be.
[32:43] What’s the matter, my child? Why is your face dull, so early in the morning? Are you worried?
[32:55] I am worried and really scared too.
[33:01] Worried because I can’t seem to understand what mom’s going to do with that ring.
[33:07] And I am scared of when Shahab asks about the ring. What will I tell him?
[33:11] I don’t understand anything, Uncle.
[33:15] Obviously, my child. You can’t tell Shahab that your mom took the ring.
[33:29] Then, what do I do?
[33:34] My child, ask your mother?
[33:37] That is exactly what I was doing, Uncle.
[33:41] I would’ve sent Danish again. But you… Didn’t you see his behavior towards me last night?
[33:53] What do I expect from him? What do I say to him?
[33:57] Uncle!
[33:59] Uncle, you will have to do this work of mine. Will you go to mom?
[34:04] Please, don’t say no. For my sake?
[34:06] Look, my child.
[34:09] If I do go and ask your mom for you, do you think she will accept it right away?
[34:16] That she was the one who took the ring?
[34:19] No, my child, no. You don’t know your mom yet.
[34:26] And if, upon my asking, she brainwashes Bhai Sahib then, he will make it a problem for me.
[34:34] But, you don’t worry.
[34:37] I will ask Bhabhi Sahiba about this, for my Chanda’s sake, for the sake of my daughters’ respect.
[34:46] Uncle, you’re very nice….
[34:59] Have this one first.
[35:02] I don’t want to have these medicines. I’m sick of having them all the time.
[35:05] How is it going to work like this?
[35:08] The doctor has said that you need to complete the course otherwise it won’t be good.
[35:17] You didn’t even sleep well all night.
[35:22] Obviously. How can anyone sleep? I was very worried because of Babar.
[35:34] I have been locked up inside the house ever since this incident took place.
[35:39] But Babar does go out. He faces people. He’s a young blood.
[35:50] How long is he going to tolerate this for? What if he makes a mistake and there is a casualty?
[35:54] God forbid!
[35:59] I will talk to him. I will make him understand.
[36:03] Do you think he will understand?
[36:06] He will have to understand.
[36:08] Now, about what he said yesterday. Is it possible, that we leave everyone and move?
[36:15] No. There’s a lot of spending on a rental house. We cannot afford it.
[36:23] Grateful to Allah that we have our own space and that He has kept our respect.
[36:30] Respect?
[36:34] The entire family falls on its face when daughters stumble.
[36:45] Chanda. I am just leaving from home. I will be there in ten minutes.
[37:11] Babar, what is this that you are doing?
[37:14] Have you gone mad?
[37:16] Keep it down!
[37:20] Keep it down…
