[00:55] You can’t do this to me. While I’m there…
[01:01] What?
[01:03] While you’re there?
[01:11] You have also died for me!
[01:30] I have died?
[01:32] Chanda has died?
[01:35] Our baby also died.
[01:38] Chanda also died.
[01:39] How is that possible?
[01:41] I left everything for you.
[01:44] I upset everyone for you.
[01:47] You left me..
[01:51] How can you leave me..
[01:55] Am I such a bad person?
[02:00] Am I such a bad person that everyone left me?
[02:06] Everyone left me.. left me..
[02:14] Yes, I am a bad person..
[02:20] Everything happened because of me..
[02:23] I hurt my father's feelings then I hurt my mother’s feelings..
[02:29] Nobody forgave me..
[02:32] Dad died because of me,
[02:36] mom stayed worried and now Shahab left me..
[02:42] My baby also died..
[02:45] I have nothing left..
[02:52] Am I such a bad person..
[02:54] Why did this happen to me..
[03:01] Dad..
[03:10] I had gone to Chanda’s house, I thought of telling you how she’s doing.
[03:22] How is she doing then?
[03:26] Chanda did take such a big step out of her foolishness but..
[03:37] What? Tell me..
[03:42] I wish I didn't have to tell you all this but
[03:45] the truth is that her in laws behavior is not right with her
[03:55] But Shebi loves her a lot
[04:00] Yes yes,
[04:02] I also used to believe the same before
[04:06] but now he has also changed quite a bit.
[04:12] They have beat our sweet little Chanda like an animal
[04:27] : I should visit her..
[04:29] No no,
[04:32] right now the time is not right. You should wait for a few days.
[04:38] A few days?
[04:42] Don’t leave her on her own.
[04:45] Yes of course, don’t worry about that. I’ll keep visiting her.
[04:56] Where’s Babar?
[04:59] He has gone to the office.
[05:02] He didn’t tell you?
[05:04] What?
[05:07] He left his job from the workshop.
[05:11] He was saying he’ll start his own business,
[05:15] he was asking for money but I couldn't give him..
[05:20] He left his job?
[05:22] Why?
[05:26] Why did he hide it from me?
[05:28] I don't know.. What can I say..
[05:35] I should be leaving. Khuda hafiz.
[05:49] I understand the fact that your responsibilities must have increased after your wedding
[05:55] and besides it’s tough to maintain a livelihood with just a job
[06:00] That is why I’m thinking of starting my own business somehow.
[06:05] That’s good, I’ll try helping you out in every possible way.
[06:10] That is why I have come to you.
[06:14] You don't know how grateful I am to you.
[06:17] You stood with us in our difficult time.
[06:20] Why are you embarrassing me?
[06:38] Here you go..
[06:39] Best of luck.
[06:41] Thank you so much.
[06:44] You don't know the favor you’ve done for me.
[06:47] And I promise you,
[06:49] I will return each and every penny of yours before time.
[06:53] I know that you are a very self respecting person
[06:57] and you will return each and every penny of mine but I have one complaint..
[07:03] Which is?
[07:05] You got married secretly and didn't even tell me.
[07:09] If I would have come, all I would have had were sweets, what else.
[07:13] You have the right to complain.
[07:16] Why don’t you come to our house for dinner tonight?
[07:19] We’ll serve you some sweets and you’ll also get to meet your daughter in law.
[07:29] Alright then,
[07:32] I’ll get to meet my daughter in law as well.
[07:35] Alright done.
[07:36] I’ll see you tonight for dinner then.
[07:39] I should be leaving then. Thank you so much,
[07:41] You’re welcome.
[07:47] For dinner..
[08:15] Hello?
[08:17] Yes?
[08:20] Alright sure, we’ll see.
[08:23] Yes.
[08:25] Okay.
[08:27] Alright okay. Khuda hafiz.
[08:54] Mom?
[08:57] Yes?
[09:02] What has happened?
[09:05] You seem worried since uncle has left.
[09:08] There’s nothing to be worried about.
[09:12] I’m sure he has said something about Api,
[09:16] that is why you’re so worried.
[09:20] She’s not happy there..
[09:24] How can she stay happy by hurting you?
[09:28] For the love of God Sitara don’t say such things,
[09:32] she’s your sister.
[09:35] I can't see her unhappy.
[09:37] So much happened because of her.
[09:40] It’s shocking to see that you’re not upset with her.
[09:45] You won’t understand.
[09:47] I don't even want to understand.
[09:50] All I know is that dad is not with us today because of the step she took.
[09:56] If she hadn't taken that step then dad would have been with us today
[10:01] and our family wouldn't have been in such a condition.
[10:04] We cannot change what is destined.
[10:08] She would have never done this
[10:10] if she would have known that our conditions would turn out this way
[10:17] and nor would her condition be this way.
[10:21] She’s facing the consequences for what she did.
[10:24] She has chosen this life for herself.
[10:29] You or I can’t do anything about that.
[10:49] I don’t love you. It was my misunderstanding, my mistake
[10:53] And now the time to fix that mistake has come.
[11:01] I will only do what my mom and dad decide for me now!
[11:05] Who are you?
[11:06] Who are you to talk to me like this?
[11:09] This is my decision. I will do whatever I like. Do you understand?
[11:33] Don’t keep yourself in any misconception.
[11:37] I'm well aware of these dramas of yours.
[11:51] What do you think Chanda?
[11:54] that you’ll melt Shebi’s heart by crying like this?
[12:00] I won't let that happen.
[12:04] I still haven’t forgotten my insult.
[12:11] You are still not satisfied even by putting me in this situation?
[12:20] Chanda,
[12:23] this is just the beginning, wait and watch what I’ll do to you.
[12:35] I am only quiet because of Shahab otherwise..
[12:38] Otherwise? otherwise what?
[12:42] What will you do Chanda?
[12:46] I think you’re forgetting,
[12:49] Shahab himself humiliated you infront of me.
[13:00] Don’t fool yourself,
[13:03] no one has more value for Shahab than his mother.
[13:09] Do you understand?
[13:16] So much anger?
[13:22] How is this their fault?
[13:27] Eat them.
[14:21] Babar! Such a huge cheque?
[14:25] That means we can start our own work?
[14:27] Ofcourse.
[14:28] I’ll keep this cheque close to my heart.
[14:31] Both of us will work very hard
[14:33] and our designs will be popular everywhere.
[14:36] Okay stop now.
[14:38] One shouldn't think too much beforehand only.
[14:41] There is one thing though,
[14:45] I feel so good to see you happy after such a long time.
[14:51] I was seeing you worried for so long.
[14:53] I am at peace to see the satisfaction on your face today that is why I'm so happy.
[14:59] Always stay happy like this.
[15:01] Babar?
[15:02] I wanted to talk to you about something..
[15:05] Yes, say it?
[15:06] I wanted to get some clothes made for myself, only if you think it’s reasonable.
[15:11] Why wouldn't I think it’s reasonable?
[15:14] Do you know, I also feel that I didn’t take you out for shopping after our marriage.
[15:19] I couldn't afford it but as soon as I cash this cheque, both of us will go shopping.
[15:27] Babar, you are actually very nice.
[15:31] There’s no need to butter me up now.
[15:33] Listen listen listen.. thank god I remembered,
[15:37] get dressed really nicely tonight. There’s a guest coming for dinner tonight..
[15:41] Is it a special guest?
[15:42] Mr. Wajid.
[15:44] He owes us a lot of favors.
[15:47] He has stood by us in our tough times
[15:50] which is why I want us two in fact all of us to treat him well.
[15:54] Don't worry, everything will be prepared and it will take place really nicely.
[15:59] Alright. I’ll arrange the food then.
[16:01] Alright
[16:09] Danish!
[16:10] Yes dad?
[16:16] What are you doing?
[16:18] Dad, my flight is tomorrow so I thought of packing everything beforehand.
[16:26] Good. Have you kept your passport?
[16:29] Yes dad.
[16:35] Dad, are you sad?
[16:40] Obviously son,
[16:43] why would you even ask such a question?
[16:46] You are my only support.
[16:49] This house will become very empty when you leave.
[16:55] You’ll see how this time will pass so quickly,
[16:58] you won’t even feel it and a year will pass at a snap of a finger.
[17:03] It’s easier for you to say
[17:06] but I know how difficult it will be for me to pass this year.
[17:12] Don't say that dad. Look, I’ll call you everyday.
[17:16] I’ll ask you to join me as soon as it’s possible.
[17:23] May God make you successful.
[17:25] Are you crying dad?
[17:28] Please be strong and besides I won’t be happy being so far away from you
[17:32] and if you’ll cry like this, then I will also lose my spirit.
[17:36] No no, no son.
[17:40] I'm not crying, I'm very happy, very happy.
[17:46] What else do I need other than to see my son being successful?
[17:55] May God keep you happy and make you successful.
[17:59] I have to do my packing now.
[18:00] I told you, if you’ll keep crying like this then I’ll lose my spirit.
[18:03] I’m fine. I’m fine.
[18:36] Babar?
[18:37] Yes?
[18:38] Your uncle came,
[18:40] he told me you left your job.
[18:46] Yes, I had to leave it.
[18:49] You didn't even tell me?
[18:52] I didn't tell you because I knew you would get worried..
[18:56] Till when would this have stayed hidden from me?
[19:02] Anyway, what do you want to do next?
[19:07] I’ve planned on starting my own business.
[19:12] You’ll need a lot of money for that…
[19:14] Yes, I will need money for it. But you don’t worry, I’ve made an arrangement for that.
[19:21] You took them from Wajid Sahib.
[19:26] How do you know?
[19:29] I am your mother. How can I not know what my children are up to?
[19:35] What’s strange is that you did the same thing you were getting upset with me for!
[19:42] Really?
[19:43] Then you tell me, what else could I have done?
[19:47] Who do I take money from to start a business?
[19:50] Wajid Sahib is still our deceased father’s friend.
[19:56] All of this doesn’t seem right to me.
[19:58] You just trust me then
[20:01] Don’t think about it. If I've taken money, I’ll also give it back on time.
[20:07] You don’t have to worry!
[20:09] Anyway, I’ve called him over for dinner tonight. Make the preparations.
[20:13] Look, I used to have an argument with Mansoor over this only.
[20:18] I don’t like that person coming here.
[20:20] And you’ve called him here for dinner?
[20:25] You talk great sometimes!
[20:28] A person has done so much for us,
[20:31] he’s stood with us through all the hardships
[20:33] and you don’t like him coming over for dinner?
[20:37] I won’t argue with you on this matter anymore.
[20:40] I have told him and he’s coming today!
[20:44] You for god sake, act nicely with him.
[20:58] Yes, yes, Ikram. You heard it right!
[21:02] I want our friendship to turn into a family relationship.
[21:07] Yes, yes. Even Shebi is ready this time.
[21:10] You just bring sister in law and Sana over tonight.
[21:14] Have dinner with us. We’ll sit and talk.
[21:16] Alright? Yeah, alright. Okay. Okay. Khuda Hafiz!
[21:24] What was he saying?
[21:25] I spoke to him right in front of you. Didn’t you hear it?
[21:30] I heard what you said. Tell me what he said!
[21:35] he couldn’t be happier!
[21:38] After all, it was always his wish to make Shebi his son in law.
[21:46] Don’t do this.
[21:50] What do you guys think?
[21:53] That Shahab is happy with this decision?
[21:58] Not at all!
[22:02] He has only agreed to this marriage due to the emotional state he is in and nothing else!
[22:08] Don’t ruin his life!
[22:09] Listen, Chanda!
[22:12] You don’t worry about his life.
[22:14] He’s my son, I know him
[22:17] He makes sure he gets whatever his heart wishes for.
[22:21] And when he’s over it, he throws it away. Like he threw you.
[22:28] Alright. Absolutely right.
[22:32] Let them come, whoever wants to!
[22:34] I’ll treat them in a way that they’ll remember for the rest of their lives!
[22:42] Bravo!
[22:47] There won’t be a need for that because you won’t come in front of them. Come!
[22:54] What are you doing? Leave me!
[22:55] Shut up!
[22:57] Leave me! What are you doing? What are you doing? I won’t go! Leave me!
[23:00] I say, come!
[23:01] Leave me!
[23:03] Leave me! Where are you taking me?
[23:05] Sit!
[23:10] Until the girl’s family doesn’t say yes and leave,
[23:15] you’ll live here only! v
[23:23] Alright?
[23:24] Where are you going? Where are you guys going?
[23:27] Enough!
[23:28] I want to get out….
[23:29] Move!
[23:31] I want to get out! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
[23:33] Open the door. Open the door! Open the door.
[23:45] Open the door.
[23:48] Open the door.
[24:40] Sitara?
[24:48] So you’re leaving tomorrow?
[24:51] Yes.
[24:55] Take good care of yourself.
[24:58] Live properly.
[25:02] Have food on time
[25:05] Don’t stay out late at night.
[25:10] For you.
[25:15] Anyway, I’m not going there forever but who knows?
[25:19] I might not be able to bear the distance once I’m there
[25:23] and I might come back for you?
[25:26] But until then, you look at this and miss me.
[25:34] I don’t need anything to miss you.
[25:38] You asked for a treat so I had to give something to you.
[25:42] How do you like it?
[25:47] This…
[26:26] Take a lot of care of yourself, Sitara.
[26:53] Mom!
[26:55] Mom!
[26:59] Mom!
[27:03] Mom!
[27:08] Mom, forgive me!
[27:20] Forgive me, Mom!
[27:30] Dad!
[27:33] Dad, come back!
[27:38] You Chanda is very lonely.
[27:41] Come back!
[27:44] Dad! Dad,
[27:51] where did you go?
[27:56] Why can’t you hear your Chanda’s voice?
[28:01] Please come back, dad!
[28:44] Water!
[29:36] yes, sister in law?
[29:37] Muraad, I want to talk to Chanda!
[29:42] The number that I call on is going off.
[29:46] Alright. I’ll send you the number I contact her on.
[29:50] Hurry! Hurry up!
[29:52] Alright. Whatever your wish may be.
[30:20] Whose phone is it that’s ringing?
[30:34] Who is this calling her?
[30:41] Hello?
[30:43] Chanda?
[30:46] I know you’re upset with me.
[30:49] I know of the torture that is being done to you.
[30:53] Muraad has told me everything.
[30:57] I wish to come running to you.
[31:01] Your brother doesn’t let me come so what do I do?
[31:08] Make me hear your voice just once.
[31:12] Chanda, my child. At least say something!
[31:17] Hello? Hello Chanda?
[31:27] Chanda! Chanda! Chanda!
[31:31] I am fed up with Chanda's name! Misery!
[31:51] Why have you switched off your phone
[31:57] Hello?
[32:20] Is everything alright? You seem very happy today.
[32:23] Oh, Bheeru! If I could, I would dance!
[32:27] My son is going to Dubai! Dubai!
[32:31] And you just see, he’ll send Dirhams for his dad from Dubai!
[32:35] Dirham on dirham! Dirham on dirham!
[32:39] I’ve heard Dubai is a very happening place?
[32:41] If your son calls you there then it’s all fun for you. All fun!
[32:46] Oh, come on. Let it be.
[32:48] Dubai and Muraad brother?
[32:50] What does he have to do over there?
[32:52] Now tell me. He talks rubbish just like his face!
[32:56] He’s my son. Mine!
[32:58] Muraad’s son! He can’t live a day without me. You’ll see.
[33:05] One day he’s going to call me to Dubai
[33:08] and I’m not going to play gambling with you poor people after that!
[33:12] What do they call it in English? Casino!
[33:16] Muraad is going to gamble in a casino! Casino!
[33:19] Casino! Casino!
[33:21] One, he’s poor. And then a gambler!
[33:34] Wajid Sahib, my wife, Erum.
[33:37] Our daughter in law is very lovely.
[33:39] Here you go, my child. This is a small present from my side.
[33:43] What was the need for that?
[33:44] Oh, why not?
[33:46] This is a tradition too and we have got to celebrate it, right?
[33:50] Thank you!
[33:51] And uncle, mine?
[33:53] How can I forget about you? Here you go. Your chocolates!
[33:59] I’ll just be back from the kitchen.
[34:00] Wajid Sahib, you please sit. Please be comfortable.
[34:08] And sister in law? Is everything alright at home?
[34:10] Yes. With Allah’s grace.
[34:12] By the way, it’s nice that Babar’s wife has come.
[34:15] Now we can see some happiness in the house.
[34:17] Otherwise after Mansoor’s demise, all we could see was sadness in this house.
[34:22] Sadness everywhere!
[34:23] yes, you’re right.
[34:27] And? When are you starting your business?
[34:30] very soon, if god wills. We’ll get the opening done from you only.
[34:32] If God wills.
[34:34] And? How is your father?
[34:36] Yes, he’s absolutely fine with Allah’s grace.
[34:39] You guys talk, I’ll…
[34:41] Yes, you make arrangements for the dinner.
[34:47] So Wajid Sahib, what I was saying is that the cloth….
[34:56] Oh, Tara! Oh, where are you!
[34:58] What happened? I’m here!
[34:59] Where is Shebi! Where is Shebi!
[35:01] I’m calling him since so long now, he isn’t picking up my phone…
[35:03] Ikram is on his way. His daughter is coming. What will we tell them?
[35:06] Oh god, what will we tell them?
[35:07] You didn’t make the call? You didn’t make the call?
[35:09] I’ll call him again! Oh, it’s the bell ringing!
[35:11] Do I look fine?
[35:12] yes, yes. Very nice. Go!
[35:13] Come, my child.
[35:18] Ikram!
[35:20] Hello, aunty! How are you? Uncle! It’s been ages!
[35:28] 58.
[35:31] How’s it going?
[35:32] Let’s go!
[35:35] How did you like the house, my child? It’s a new house.
[35:38] You came to the old one, right?
[35:41] Yes. It’s really nice, aunty.
[35:43] Yeah, not bad.
[35:44] So let’s go to the drawing room then. To the drawing room?
[35:47] Come, come. Sit in the drawing room.
[35:49] Long time!
[35:50] Yes, very!
[35:51] Long time!
[35:52] Bravo! I enjoyed having home cooked food after many days!
[35:57] By the way sister in law, biryani made by you was outstanding! It’s delicious!
[36:05] And now if we get to have tea made by Sitara then it’ll be just perfect!
[36:40] I’ll just go and call dad. He hasn’t come yet.
[36:45] Yes.
