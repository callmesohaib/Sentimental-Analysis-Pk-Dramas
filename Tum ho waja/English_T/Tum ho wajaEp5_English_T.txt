[00:26] Okay talk politely
[00:29] Tell me that did api ever obeyed you?
[00:32] Did she ever obey mom?
[00:34] She has always forcefully done things through dad
[00:38] Dad's love has spoiled her
[00:40] It's not mother's fault at all
[00:44] Api has opened doors of hell for herself for not obeying mom
[00:51] Now you can see what do you have to do...
[00:57] No!
[01:01] My heaven is for all my kids
[01:26] Here you go.. I can tell the food is delicious by the smell of it.
[01:31] Why did you bring it? I would’ve gotten it myself.
[01:34] No, that’s okay. Say Bismillah, start eating..
[01:40] Has Danish come?
[01:42] Yes, he’s in his room.
[01:45] I’ll go call him..
[01:46] No no, let it be. Actually Chanda, the thing is that Danish is a bit angry with you.
[01:59] I made him understand and he understood. It’ll be better if you just try and not face him.
[02:08] Did you speak to Shebi on the phone?
[02:10] No.. I’ve been calling him since so long, he’s not picking up.
[02:16] He said he’ll visit in the evening and he didn’t come.
[02:19] I’m feeling agitated.. I don’t know what will happen..
[02:22] Chanda don’t worry, my prayers are guarding you two. Inshallah nothing will happen.
[02:29] And can I tell you something?
[02:31] I am proud of my Chanda, of my daughter and her choice. Shebi is a very nice and decent boy.
[02:56] Dad
[02:59] Are you angry on me? Why don't you answer me?
[03:06] No...I am not angry on you
[03:11] You are my good son
[03:20] You must be tired, go and sleep
[03:26] Dad! Can I sleep with you?
[03:29] Yes yes, why not. Come!
[03:35] Come my son...
[03:44] Dad, where has Chanda sister gone?
[03:55] It's very late, go to sleep you have to go to school tomorrow as well
[04:12] Mama sorry.. sorry.. please.. I am very embarrassed, mama please..
[04:24] Shebi, I’ve always fulfilled your wishes since you were a child.
[04:31] If your father wouldn’t have agreed, I would have still gone with you.
[04:36] I would have gotten you married in front of myself
[04:39] and I would have brought my daughter in law home in a magnificent way
[04:45] but you didn’t trust me..
[04:48] No mama no.. I had gotten scared. I had gotten scared,
[04:54] I thought you two won’t let this marriage happen.
[04:58] Son, a mother’s heart is like a candle,
[05:03] it melts on little things and a mother can give big sacrifices for the happiness of her child.
[05:12] I don’t know why and what deluded you and you didn’t trust even me.
[05:21] Look, I am apologizing to you.. please.. please forgive me, please..
[05:31] No son.. Promise me,
[05:35] put your hand on my head and promise me that you won’t ever lie to me Shebi
[05:40] and you will make me a part of every happiness of yours..
[05:42] Promise, I promise you mama.
[05:45] I won’t do anything in my life without asking you now..
[06:11] Danish.. Listen to me.. Where are you going?
[06:14] It’s better if you don’t talk to me.
[06:17] Look everyone’s anger is understandable but think about me also,
[06:22] god had given me the right of whatever I did.
[06:26] Your parents also had some right on you.
[06:28] You didn’t even think twice if they’ll be able to bear the embarrassment you caused them.
[06:33] I had told mom, I had told her everything that Shahab likes me and he wants to marry me.
[06:38] Uncle and aunty even came to talk about the proposal
[06:41] but mom refused then tell me what would I have done?
[06:44] Then you should have waited.
[06:46] Ghafoor uncle went to dad also
[06:48] and dad insulted him and will that poor guy keep on getting himself insulted?
[06:54] You’re worried about his respect and you don’t care about the respect of your parents.
[06:56] Why did you choose a proposal where there’s only disrespect and no respect?
[07:00] I will get respect and that respect will be provided to me by Shahab.
[07:05] Once her parents apologize I'll bring her home
[07:12] And she will take good care of you
[07:15] Insha Allah  son...
[07:26] Whether they apologize or not, she will never come in this house
[07:33] My son...
[07:47] How are you feeling now?
[07:51] Zain was telling me that you were quite restless the whole night.
[08:00] Mansoor..
[08:05] I can bear every problem of the world but I can’t bear your silence and resentment.
[08:15] Please talk to me for the love of god.
[08:25] What do you want from me?
[08:27] Take the suspicion out of your heart
[08:30] Huh! Suspicion..
[08:34] This family faced doomsday in fact it hasn’t passed, it’s still ongoing.
[08:44] My daughter ran away and got married
[08:47] and you’re asking me to take the suspicion out of my heart..
[08:50] I’m not to be blamed for that. How would I have known that she would take such a big step?
[08:54] You’re her mother. Keeping an eye on everything is your responsibility.
[09:02] I can’t accept it, how is it possible that you didn’t feel anything, that you didn’t see anything..
[09:11] You’re also the father, she was closer to you than me.
[09:15] You know that she didn’t bother about me knowing that I wasn’t oblivious about my children.
[09:22] They had brought a proposal,
[09:25] What would I have told you? Those people..
[09:28] Mom..
[09:33] Is everything okay?
[09:37] I called you last night but you didn’t pick up.
[09:41] I was getting so paranoid..
[09:44] I was getting scared and wondering what happened to you..
[09:50] I am talking to you.
[09:53] What has happened? Why aren’t you answering me? Say something Shebi..
[09:59] We made a mistake Chanda, a very big mistake.
[10:07] why can’t you two let go of these things?
[10:11] Do you know I don’t like living in this house, I feel affrighted!
[10:15] I feel like running away
[10:20] but then I wonder what will become of Zain and Sitara..
[10:27] And god forbid if anything happens to any of you then what will become of us three..
[10:32] Have you ever thought about that?
[10:36] Dad I have one request from you that we, all of us have to fix the environment of this house.
[10:53] Your parents didn’t want to participate in this wedding
[10:57] but my parents were happy in my happiness.
[11:02] I could have at least made them a part of it.
[11:09] Yes, we didn’t think of that. You’re right..
[11:16] We didn’t get a chance to think.
[11:20] We decided in a rush out of our emotions.
[11:26] but Chanda the way my mother was crying in agonizing pain last night,
[11:32] I didn’t know what to do.. I just felt like rewinding the time somehow.
[11:40] Take me to her once, I’ll ask for forgiveness.
[11:47] I’ll do whatever she says,
[11:49] Look Chanda, now your parents are going to be the ones who will go to my parents
[11:53] and ask for forgiveness before you.
[11:58] I have promised them that.
[12:10] Asalam o alikum
[12:11] Walikum Asalam. Here you go children, I didn’t forget to get your chocolates.
[12:20] Thank you
[12:21] There’s Chanda’s..
[12:30] there’s also a packet for Chanda in this..
[12:33] Go wash your face, go on.
[12:39] Your husband is the one who is sick but you look more unwell than him.
[12:43] How can it go on like this?
[12:45] You have to get the children married,
[12:48] you have to take care of him and you have many other responsibilities as well.
[12:52] Both of you will have to show some strength okay?
[12:56] you take rest and then come to office in a few days.
[13:13] Those are rubies, right? Why are you stressing? Be chill.
[13:20] They won’t dare to come here after the insult we have put them through.
[13:25] This is a matter of their children. Especially their daughter. What if they do come?
[13:30] Let them come.
[13:33] I will deal with them in such a way that they will hold their daughters’ hand and take her from here.
[13:38] I am not worried about her. I am worried about my son. How will you handle him?
[13:43] He is my son. I am his father. I will handle everything.
[13:51] Ghafoor Counsellor is my name. I can handle anyone.
[13:59] After all that has happened in this house because of you guys,
[14:02] I can’t even get a single drop of water through my throat. And you’re talking about tea?
[14:08] The disgrace that has taken place, we have got to stop it from spreading.
[14:13] You… you come. Come with me. I have to talk to you. Sit over here.
[14:22] Look, sister in law. He is my brother.
[14:27] I cannot see my brother in so much pain. My heart cries tears of blood.
[14:37] Obviously, he is my brother. He’s like my father to me. I cannot see my father suffering.
[14:44] What happened? What did the doctor say? Is everything okay?
[14:48] Sister in law, I never went back to the doctor.
[14:53] He would say something if I had gone to him but I never got the time.
[14:57] I am just trying to fix the troubles that are staying at my house. That’s it.
[15:02] May Allah take care of everything, what has happened, Muraad?
[15:05] Actually…. Sister in law, Shebi has left Chanda at my house.
[15:16] What! Why? What has Chanda done?
[15:20] Sister in law, Chanda has done whatever it is that she had to do.
[15:25] Muraad, tell me everything! What happened?
[15:29] Keep it low.
[15:30] What happened? Why has Shebi left her at your house?
[15:34] The truth is that Shebi's parents haven’t accepted our Chanda.
[15:43] God knows what it is that’s written in our daughter’s fate.
[15:49] You get up, come with me! Come with me. Get up.
[15:51] The matter is in yours and mines hand now. God knows what’s going to happen if we lose control of it.
[16:05] Shebi is a nice guy. I am trying to make him understand nicely
[16:09] that he should convince his mom and dad and take our Chanda to his house with respect.
[16:15] This matter has become more aggravated than the hell that broke lose in this house.
[16:20] You make Shebi understand at any cost to take Chanda home!
[16:23] Sister in law, I will put all my efforts into doing so. Chanda is my blood,
[16:29] she’s my daughter. I will try my best.
[16:35] Actually, sister in law…
[16:38] You know of my household and Danish’s business is also in front of you.
[16:47] I am fulfilling every little need of Chanda’s but my pockets are empty so if you could…
[16:57] Yes… I’ll bring it. I’m bringing it.
[17:07] Sister In law, my pocket is empty… If you could help me a little…
[17:34] Shebis parents haven’t accepted our Chanda.
[17:43] I don’t know where I went wrong while bringing up Chanda.
[17:50] I loved her a lot. I gave her more love and care than I did to any of our children
[18:28] My Allah! Have mercy on my Chanda!
[18:33] Give her all the happiness that she took this step for.
[18:40] I forgive her with all my heart. You also forgive her.
[19:14] Listen! Where are you going?
[19:19] We ran out of groceries. So I was just going to get that.
[19:25] Here, give me the money. I will go and get it.
[19:28] Where will you go in all this heat?
[19:35] Aren’t you also going in this heat?
[19:38] I cannot tolerate the fact that I stay at the house like that and you…
[19:46] out in the markets. Come on, give it to me.
[19:52] Actually... Riaz Baji called. I have to give her the committee money…
[19:57] Already, it has gotten really late so I thought I’d give the money to her on my way…
[20:10] So this means that it is necessary for you only, to go.
[20:19] Yes.
[20:23] Alright, go.
[20:54] So you have found out that I am here?
[21:06] Are you here to look at my show?
[21:09] You always think negatively.
[21:11] Everything that is happening to me today is because I am paying for your deeds!
[21:19] Chanda! Believe me! Your happiness is very precious to me…
[21:26] Shahab is my happiness. His home is my happiness!
[21:31] I got Shahab. But to live in his house, I haven’t…
[21:36] You listen to me! I will only get to live in his house
[21:42] when you personally go and apologize to his parents!
[21:44] Why don’t you understand what I’m telling you?
[21:46] At least listen to what I have to say…
[21:47] I don’t want to hear anything!
[21:50] I am ready to do anything for you,
[21:56] Chanda. Just pray that your father…
[21:57] Right now you shouldn’t be worried about dad but your daughter.
[22:01] Go and apologize to them! Actually, if it’s possible you go and apologize right now!
[22:06] Yes! I will go right now!
[22:09] Sister in law, this is all happening because of you
[22:13] And so, you will have to handle it alone only.
[22:17] You should go to Shebi’s house for Chandas happiness.
[22:27] And if you don’t go over there, I’ll think that you don’t love me.
[22:41] I… love you a lot, Chanda.
[23:47] When you will understand and learn it will become knowledge and will be there in your memory forever
[23:56] Dad, tea
[23:58] Where has mom gone?
[24:00] Is it very hot?
[24:02] Yes, its a little too hot
[24:05] Your mom went to the market...
[24:07] its been very long since she has gone, she should have been back by now
[24:10] I will have tea later let me check on her first
[24:12] No dad you wait I will go and see
[24:15] You are not feeling well
[24:18] Listen! Come here...
[24:21] Do you know the house where she gives money for committee?
[24:24] Yes dad I have seen that house, she goes to my friend's mom for it
[24:28] Okay then go and see there and if you don't find her there then come straight home don't go looking after her
[24:33] Okay!
[24:34] Go!
[24:35] Come straight home!
[24:38] Listen, make lunch becuase she will be tired when she comes home...
[24:43] Okay I am making
[24:45] Do you want anything else?
[24:46] No, I don't want anything
[25:11] How dare you came here?
[25:15] I...wanted to talk to you
[25:22] Shut up!
[25:23] Huh! Wants to talk...
[25:26] You are a shamless woman
[25:30] If you had even a little respect for yourself then you shouldn't have dared to come here
[25:38] Go!
[25:39] Go and die of shame
[25:46] I...I have come with a lot of hopes
[25:52] Good! Its good to have hopes but...
[25:58] You will get nothing except disrespect and discourage
[26:08] The way you and your daughter have trapped my son and played with his feelings, you will see its result
[26:21] What are you saying?
[26:25] We have played a game...?
[26:28] You came with the proposal at our home and then you asked me refuse from it....
[26:34] Have you gone mad?
[26:35] When did we say that?
[26:37] You said that yourself that day...
[26:41] Shut up!
[26:46] Don't know whether you mom has gone to Shebi's parents or not...
[26:53] What happened Chanda?
[26:56] What are you looking for?
[26:57] Uncle I am unable to find my ring, I don't know where it has gone
[27:00] Ring?
[27:03] Where did you keep it?
[27:05] I was putting lotion on my hands, then I went towash my hands. Now I can't find it. I kept it here only
[27:10] Don't worry, it might be here somewhere look around carefully
[27:14] I have seen everywhere, can't find it anywhere...
[27:16] If Shahab finds out about it then will be a big problem
[27:27] What happened uncle?
[27:31] Is it possible that you mom might have taken it...
[27:37] To throw it on their face and return it..
[27:49] Mom...?
[27:52] You already know that she can do anything
[27:59] Mom...
[28:02] Okay
[28:05] So mom and daughter are trying to make our son go against us. Is it so?
[28:11] You guys have got some misunderstanding
[28:14] I did as you told and asked Chanda to refuse from this proposal
[28:19] And that is why she is blaming me for all this
[28:23] Go to hell you and your characterless daughter
[28:31] You are a very fraudulent woman
[28:34] I had only heard of people like you but now I have seen one too
[28:40] Like mother, like daughter
[28:43] Get lost from here
[28:47] Look!
[28:49] Whatever you want to say, say it to me but let my daughter live in this house
[28:56] No!
[28:59] Chanda what happened? Why do you look worried?
[29:07] Mom came to meet me
[29:14] Okay, she must be saying things against me
[29:20] No! She didn't say anyhting like that
[29:25] I can't believe it
[29:27] She is not happy with our marriage
[29:30] Anyways what discussion did you guys have?
[29:33] Did you make her understand?
[29:36] Yes, I talked to her and she has gone to you house
[29:41] Where? My house?
[29:44] Yes, for apologizing
[29:46] With whom?
[29:47] Alone
[29:50] Chanda what stupidity has she done
[29:52] We had agreed on this that if my parents apologize then everything will be sorted and I will be able to go in that house
[29:58] I agree...
[29:59] Then what is the problem?
[30:00] But this wasn't decided that she will go there alone
[30:03] Do you remember when my parents went with th porposal at your place, she was alone there as well
[30:08] What do you think, she must be apologizing at my home in front of my parents?
[30:12] You do wonders...
[30:15] She must have ruined things rather then setting them right
[30:21] I didn't think about this...I made a mistake. Now what? What should we do?
[30:28] What was the hurry? You could have waited for me
[30:31] I have said everything...
[30:33] Do one thing, you go home. Mom might have just reached there
[30:37] I am going
[30:38] Listen! Call me and tell what happened
[30:40] Okay, close the door
[30:41] Do call me...
[30:44] Why it can't happen?
[30:47] It's for your son's happiness
[30:50] You can give respect to my daughter just for him
[30:52] What did you say? Respect?
[30:55] Respect to that girl?
[30:57] Who's brother came here and was misbehaving with me
[31:03] And his father, instead of keeping his eyes he is staring at me and talking to him
[31:12] Did he come for apologizing?
[31:18] I am apologizing on his behalf
[31:23] If you say...
[31:24] Enough!
[31:25] What do you think?
[31:28] You wil apologize and I will forgive you?
[31:30] Why should I do it? Do you know who I am?
[31:33] My name is Ghafoor counsellor. I have many contacts
[31:38] And those people respect me a lot
[31:43] Tell your gentleman husband to come here
[31:47] And beg for forgiveness
[31:52] Then I might forgive him...
[31:57] Please don't do this, he will die of shame...
[32:02] Let him die, didn't he die yet?
[32:05] His daughter ran away and he is still alive shameless
[32:15] I can't see tears in a woman's eyes
[32:20] Do one thing, tell him to come here and apologize
[32:30] And if he didn't do this, then I won't let your daughter come in this house
[32:35] Neither I will let her stay in my son's life
[32:46] Please listen to me
[32:47] Enough!
[32:49] We have listened you a lot, its enough now!
[32:52] Atleast you try to understand me, you are aslo a mother
[32:56] Mother? I am only my son's mother. I am not anyone else's mother
[33:03] You people have made our son go against us...
[33:07] You will pay a very heavy price for that
[33:11] Get lost from here!
[33:24] The door is there. Is there someone? Take her outside
[33:35] For God sake...
[33:35] Your husband will come here and apologize. That's it!
[33:48] Drama! Mother and daughter are drama
[33:54] Look what I will do
[33:59] Yes Chanda! Did your mother return?
[34:04] No, mom hasn't returned yet
[34:08] Okay!
[34:10] Shahab came, I have sent him back home
[34:14] Did you find the ring?
[34:20] No!
[34:22] You were right!
[34:26] Mom has taken the ring
[34:29] And now she will return it to his parents
[34:36] Uncle, if this happens Shahab will leave me and if he leaves me I will die. What should I do? I am confused
[34:45] Calm down, don't worry nothing will happen
[34:49] What do you mean calm down uncle?
[34:53] Everything has gone wrong. Whenever I try to fix things everything goes wrong. What should I do? Please come home soon I am confused
[35:01] Okay I am coming
[35:12] Assalam o Alaikum!
[35:13] How are you?
[35:15] I am fine, how about you?
[35:18] I am great as always
[35:21] So what made you come here?
[35:23] Some conditions force me to come to you
[35:26] You came to buy something?
[35:28] That day will come too when I will come here to buy something from you
[35:34] For now I want to sell this ring
[35:43] It's not worth more than 8-10k
[35:45] Are you crazy?
[35:47] You will give 8-10k for this?
[35:49] You will play with me like other shopkeepers?
[35:54] Nowadays market is not going good...
[35:56] Oh come on man! I have been listening this all my life. I know very well that what is it's real worth.
[36:05] And don't forget that your business
is going on is just because of me. If I
[36:10] don't come here then no one will even
step in your shop. Now take out 20k!
[36:15] But...
[36:15] No ifs and buts! It is beneficial for both of us! I know very well what is its real worth. Now give me 20k!
[36:32] What do you mean you didn't find her?
[36:34] Did you go there?
[36:35] I wnet to her, she said that she didn't come here
[36:39] Okay
[36:40] I will go and...
[36:47] Assalam o Alaikum!
[36:48] Walikum Assalam
[36:49] Go and get a glass of water for your mother
[36:54] Where were you?
[36:57] I told you...I went to get the committee and then I went to the market
[37:04] Really? You went to give the committee?
[37:08] Yes. Why?
[37:12] Go!
[37:17] Zain went their house. She said that you didn't come there
[37:23] If only she would have been at home then she would have known that I came
[37:27] Then I went to the market
[37:30] So, it took a long time in the market?
[37:36] Yes, there were a lot people in the market so it took so much time
[37:40] If you had gone to get things from the market then where are thethings?
