[00:40] Brother, where were you? Mom was getting so worried….
[00:43] Who is this girl?
[00:49] This… Her name is Erum. And… I have gotten married to her.
[01:05] What?
[01:07] What is this nonsense Babar?
[01:11] I am not talking nonsense uncle, this is the truth.
[01:16] Today is dad’s fortieth day after death and you’re saying you’ve gotten married to her?
[01:21] It didn’t even occur to you about what people will say.
[01:24] Why should we care about people? They say whatever they like,
[01:28] we can’t stop them from talking. I was very helpless..
[01:32] What? What made you so helpless that you had to get married today only?
[01:37] Babar, the soil of your father’s grave hasn’t even dried yet and you’ve gotten married?
[01:43] I can’t believe you did this!
[01:45] Uncle, at least listen to me..
[01:47] What?
[01:48] What is left to be said and be heard?
[01:52] Have you forgotten how your father raised you? For this day?
[01:59] My brother’s soul must be writhing today.
[02:01] I haven’t done anything which will make his soul writhe
[02:04] I haven’t sinned uncle.
[02:06] I have only given dependence to an orphan,
[02:09] unbacked girl who did me a favor in fact did all of us a favor.
[02:12] Do you know who gave the money for the hospital bill? Erum!
[02:16] All you could find was today to repay all the favors?
[02:21] I know today wasn’t the right time or place to do all this
[02:27] but I was helpless, what could I have done?
[02:30] If you all can’t accept his decision of mine then that’s okay.
[02:34] I will leave this house and go.
[02:39] Let’s go Erum.
[02:40] Hold on!
[02:47] You won’t go anywhere.
[02:54] This girl is this family’s respect, you will live here now.
[03:02] Sister in law! How can..
[03:19] Take her inside..
[03:21] Let’s go..
[03:41] Today she said that this girl is this family’s respect so easily..
[03:46] Then what else could have aunty said in that situation?
[03:48] She should have given him a befitting reply!
[03:51] She has made Babar egotist, he doesn't listen to anyone!
[03:56] He didn’t even respect today’s date and got married!
[03:59] And all she did was watch the show quietly!
[04:02] Dad, you know Babar..
[04:05] If he would have left the house then the problem would have gotten worse
[04:08] and besides getting married isn’t a sin.
[04:12] What? What did you say?
[04:15] You mean to say whatever he did was right?
[04:19] He didn't ask nor did he tell us. God knows who the girl is and where he got her from.
[04:24] Dad, whoever she may be, she is his wife now and your daughter in law.
[04:27] No, not at all.
[04:28] She means nothing to me.
[04:31] She is my sister in law’s daughter in law.
[04:34] And besides there’s nothing left for me in that house after my brother.
[04:39] From now on I will not interfere in their family matters, no way.
[04:43] Dad, what are  you saying? You are the elder of the family now.
[04:47] No! No way!
[04:49] She is the elder of the family, whose decisions take place.
[04:54] She destroyed her children.
[04:57] My brother couldn’t show his face to anyone because of her
[05:01] and my brother left this world having grief in his heart.
[05:05] I don’t know, I don’t know how much more distress will we have to see from that family.
[05:12] God knows what kind of era we are living in..
[05:16] Suddenly he came and said that she’s your daughter in law.
[05:18] Accept it. I don’t accept it, no.
[05:39] I wanted to speak to you mom..
[05:45] You’ve already done what you wanted to do,
[05:48] what is left to say now?
[05:56] I know what you're going through..
[06:01] But trust me, I was helpless.
[06:06] What made you so helpless?
[06:09] Forget about telling your mother,
[06:13] you didn’t even respect your father’s fortieth day after death.
[06:16] God knows what kind of girl from god knows what family you married and brought home.
[06:26] She has no family,
[06:30] the poor thing is an orphan.
[06:35] She’s an orphan, not you.
[06:38] You could have at least spoken to me.
[06:41] What did you think? That i wouldn’t have understood you?
[06:45] Or that I wouldn’t have supported you?
[06:47] I would’ve picked a nice occasion
[06:49] and I would have gotten you married in front of a few people with respect.
[06:51] I didn’t have time mom.
[06:57] Trust me,
[06:59] I had no such relationship with her before today, before this marriage.
[07:04] In fact, she was engaged.
[07:07] She used to just work with me and she was sitting with me
[07:11] and her fiancé showed up.
[07:12] God knows what he thought, he came and threatened to kill her.
[07:18] You tell me what could I have done in such circumstances?
[07:21] If I would have sent her home then her family would have killed her
[07:25] and if I would have left her alone then she would have killed herself.
[07:31] You tell me, I only saved her life. Did I do something wrong?
[07:42] Stay happy
[07:44] Start of a new journey..
[07:48] I’m just afraid of you getting stuck in a deep issue.
[07:54] Take care..
[07:55] Nothing will happen.. Nothing will happen to me.
[07:59] I just wanted to say to you that now
[08:03] she’s here, please talk to her with love.
[08:10] Try giving her a chance..
[08:41] Please keep sitting.
[08:53] I don't know where to start from, how to start..
[08:59] I know you must be feeling weird.
[09:04] You came home for the first time today and
[09:08] my family spoke to you in such a bad manner
[09:15] but it’s not their fault.
[09:20] All of us have seen so much sadness in such a short span of time
[09:28] that they weren’t able to digest this news.
[09:33] At first because of Chanda running away
[09:38] and then dad passing away from that shock.
[09:46] Today is dad’s fortieth day after death and we had to get married because of our compulsion.
[09:55] So will she live in this house now?
[09:57] Of course, she is your sister in law. All of us will live together.
[10:03] We didn’t decorate the house nor was there any wedding procession.
[10:05] We had so much fun at Ahsan brother’s wedding.
[10:08] We went in a bus to get the bride. Why didn’t we go to get my brother's bride?
[10:14] We had gotten busy in other matters.
[10:20] It was your father’s fortieth day after death, that’s why.
[10:24] You go on and do your school work. You have to go to school tomorrow,
[10:28] you have so much homework left.
[10:40] Did he have to do all of this today?
[10:46] How can he be so selfish, I can't believe it.
[10:51] He has only gotten married quietly.
[10:56] So quietly that he didn't even let his mother know.
[11:01] Your brother has grown up, he is independent now
[11:06] He has the right to get married
[11:09] And he likes Erum,
[11:14] we shouldn't have any objections if she can keep them happy.
[11:19] Really? That means whatever brother did was right..
[11:25] He didn't do anything wrong also.
[11:29] If all this is right then whatever aapi did, what was that?
[11:33] She also had the full right to make a decision for herself.
[11:37] She had also gotten married.
[11:40] Then why was there so much hate for her?
[11:42] No parent can hate their children.
[11:47] It’s the society which makes you helpless by taunting you.
[11:53] One needs to do certain things in order to save face.
[12:00] Society, people, respect, where did all these things go now?
[12:06] Nobody said anything, nobody gave any taunts.
[12:09] Brother even got a place to stay with his wife.
[12:14] Erum doesn’t have anyone, the poor thing doesn’t have parents.
[12:18] Daughters then should be called parentless
[12:22] even if they have parents or even if they don’t just like Aapi .
[12:33] But you are a member of this family now
[12:36] and because of that you have many responsibilities now.
[12:41] I would want you to win my family’s hearts by your good behavior and good nature.
[12:52] And trust me,
[12:56] I understand how important the wedding day is for a girl.
[13:03] If her happiness gets ruined because of other people’s circumstances then
[13:11] grief must be a lot.
[13:18] Your issues and these relationship problems of yours ruined such a beautiful time of my life
[13:30] What happened to you? What are you thinking about?
[13:34] No, nothing.
[13:39] Are you happy?
[13:42] Yes..
[13:46] Stop it Sitara.
[13:48] All you talk about is Chanda.
[13:50] What I’m saying is correct
[13:53] and this should reach brother and if you don’t tell him then I will.
[13:59] For the love of God stop it!
[14:02] I have only a few years left to live, that too you all aren’t letting me live in peace
[14:05] I am tired now!
[14:15] I am not that young that I would be unable to see your suffering,
[14:21] affliction, sacrifices, I understand all of it.
[14:26] Which is why i want my brother to understand as well.
[14:30] Just like he’s your son, your child, Aapi is also your daughter.
[14:38] Your father used to say that Chanda is dead for us..
[14:46] If he would have been alive today
[14:50] then would he have said the same for what brother did?
[14:54] Would he have ended his relationship with him also?
[14:58] Would he have kicked him out of the house as well?
[15:01] Sitara, don’t say all of this..
[15:05] What if your brother hears all this..
[15:10] He’s who is Zain and your shelter,
[15:15] he’s the only one who is your support now.
[15:17] God forbid if he gets upset then he might leave the house.
[15:31] It will take some time but everything will be fine.
[16:04] Assalam o Alaikum.
[16:07] Walaikum a Salam.
[16:23] What are you thinking about?
[16:26] Sitara, bring breakfast for your brother.
[16:33] Erum isn’t awake yet?
[16:38] No, the poor thing didn’t sleep all night.
[16:43] She was very embarrassed..
[16:46] Tell her there is no need to be embarrassed.
[16:56] Mom, i hope you don’t feel that
[16:59] i will run away from my responsibilities now that I’m married.
[17:09] What needs to happen, happens on its own.
[17:13] God has made a person his own dependent, not of others.
[17:20] If he wants he can bless us with noble children and fill our lives with happiness
[17:28] and if he wants he can give us disobedient children and make it an ordeal for the parents.
[17:36] I’ll bring breakfast for you..
[18:00] What is your problem after all?
[18:02] Everyone is waiting for you at breakfast. Why don’t you come downstairs?
[18:04] Why don’t you sit with everyone?
[18:07] I’m not hungry. Go away from here.
[18:13] I am sick of this attitude of yours
[18:15] What do you want after all? What is this house lacking?
[18:18] Why don’t you ask this question from yourself?
[18:21] What do I ask? Tell me, what do I ask?
[18:23] Yesterday was dad’s 40th day after death!
[18:25] You knew that I couldn’t go there, because of you!
[18:28] You should’ve been there with me,
[18:29] you should’ve spent time with me but you didn’t come!
[18:32] I waited for you all night, I called you and you didn’t even talk to me
[18:35] And you’re asking me what’s wrong?
[18:36] So what should I have done?
[18:37] What’s the big deal if I spent one night sleeping in my mom’s room!
[18:40] There is no big deal about it!
[18:41] I have never stopped you! You can talk to her,
[18:43] sleep with her or spend an entire day with her but yesterday was dad’s 40th!
[18:48] You should’ve been with me
[18:50] because I couldn’t go over there because of you and your family!
[18:54] And I didn’t go, right?
[18:55] And you weren’t there either!
[18:58] How insensitive are you!
[19:02] You have changed a lot, Shahab.
[19:07] You aren’t what you were before.
[19:09] Enough! Enough!
[19:12] Don’t you test my patience!
[19:14] If you want to live in this house, you will have to live according to its rules!
[19:21] The choice is yours
[19:56] Erum, come sit with us.
[19:58] How did you like the house?
[20:01] Yes, aunty. It’s very nice.
[20:05] Look, now you are my daughter just like Sitara is.
[20:09] Call me mom.
[20:12] Yes, mom.
[20:15] Is there any problem that you’re facing in the house?
[20:18] No.
[20:21] Sitara! Have a conversation with your sister in law.
[20:25] She’s new in the house. She must be stressed. Be friends with her.
[20:38] Don’t feel bad about this.
[20:40] Actually, everything was very sudden.
[20:45] That’s why she’s also feeling weird.
[20:48] She’ll mingle with you herself in no time.
[20:54] Actually, the way you two have gotten married and the way you have come here….
[20:59] Nobody has liked it.
[21:02] But things will fall into place with time.
[21:05] Forget what’s done and has passed!
[21:08] Start over your life. This is your home now.
[21:12] I will try my best.
[21:18] You aren’t my daughter in law now, but my daughter.
[21:21] If you have any troubles or any issues, you can talk to me like you would to your mother.
[21:25] Don’t hesitate.
[21:29] Alright, go freshen up. I will make breakfast for you.
[21:45] Umer! Umer, what is all this? The shop is all messed up outside,
[21:49] and the workshop is also destroyed! What has happened?
[21:50] Don’t act so dumb!
[21:52] You know it very well that all of this has happened because of you!
[21:54] Umer, what are you trying to say? Be frank!
[21:58] Where is Erum?
[22:01] Erum? Erum… is at my house.
[22:04] You know that you can’t take a girl, a girl who’s a stranger….
[22:08] She isn’t a stranger!
[22:10] I have married her, she’s my wife.
[22:13] You have married her?
[22:15] Babar, you have gone mad!
[22:16] Umer, try to understand what I am telling you.
[22:20] She was going through a very difficult time. She was going to commit suicide.
[22:22] I did all this to save her life!
[22:25] Babar, don’t forget that she works here
[22:27] and I am responsible for any mishap!
[22:31] What do you mean?
[22:33] What I mean is that you ran off with a girl and married her!
[22:38] Today, for the first time in life,
[22:41] I was humiliated in the market, only and only because of you!
[22:45] And Erum’s family has done this to me, only because of you!
[22:50] I am sorry, friend.
[22:51] You go from here before her family comes over here again and any bloodshed takes place!
[22:58] Umer, at least try to understand what I am saying. Hear me out once.
[23:02] I told you, right? Go away from here!
[23:04] You were acting very respectable when it was about your sister.
[23:06] You used to pull peoples tongues out…
[23:07] Enough!
[23:11] It’ll get very ugly if you utter a single word from your mouth about my sister!
[23:16] Look, Babar! For god sake, go away from here!
[23:18] I am folding my hands in front of you!
[23:21] After that, it’s between you and Erum’s family. But please, have mercy on me!
[23:37] Assalam o Alaikum, dad!
[23:40] Walaikum a Salam!
[23:42] Is everything alright? How come you’re back so early today?
[23:44] The news is such, dad that I came running!
[23:49] Did you get married too?
[23:51] Stop it, dad. Does your son look like that to you?
[23:55] Oh, you can expect anything from today’s generation!
[24:01] You won’t ever find out what they’re up to!
[24:04] Anyway… you tell me, what’s the good news?
[24:08] Dad, I got an email from Dubai saying that they have chosen me for the job again!
[24:12] Oh, wow! This is a very good news!
[24:16] Many congratulations to you! Many many congratulations!
[24:19] Ma sha Allah! I always knew that my son was very illegible!
[24:26] It’s all due to your blessings, dad.
[24:28] All my blessings are for my son!
[24:32] Now, I hope you don’t forget about your poor father
[24:34] while you enjoy the glamorous life in Dubai!
[24:38] What are you saying, dad? Is that even possible?
[24:40] Alright, tell me this. When do you have to go?
[24:43] I have to go this week only.
[24:46] Oh! So soon?
[24:48] I’ll get my visa in two or three days and after that, I will have to leave immediately.
[24:53] Alright. To tell you the truth, this house will be completely empty once you’re gone.
[25:01] Dad, I am doing all this for you and this house. You just don’t be sad.
[25:07] Go carefully! I will pray that you settle as soon as possible!
[25:12] Once you’re settled, call your dad!
[25:14] What will I do without you alone in this house?
[25:18] Dad, you don’t worry. I will call you soon!
[25:21] Come on. Get your mouth sweet. With a biscuit!
[25:30] Sitara, are you upset with me?
[25:40] Why did you think so?
[25:44] I have been noticing
[25:46] that you seem upset ever since I have come to this house.
[25:51] There’s nothing like that.
[25:55] Alright, come on. I’ll help you prepare the food.
[25:58] No. There’s no need for that. You take a rest.
[26:03] Alright, at least tell me what does Babar like to eat the most?
[26:12] That’s strange.
[26:15] You got married to brother but you don’t even know what he likes to eat?
[26:24] Actually…. Everything happened so suddenly
[26:28] that I couldn’t even get a chance to find anything out.
[26:36] Indeed.
[26:39] Everything happened so quickly that we didn’t even get a chance to know anything
[26:44] On one side, there was a prayer meeting for dad
[26:47] and on the other side was his son’s wedding took place.
[26:54] Sitara!
[26:57] I’ll be there, mom!
[27:24] Who gave you these clothes?
[27:26] I am asking you something. Why don’t you respond to me!
[27:35] You haven’t been able to wash these four clothes by now?
[27:40] You have to wash these sheets too!
[27:42] And make sure you don’t mix them with the white clothes!
[27:45] Mom, it’s hurting a lot.
[27:48] I’ll wash these sheets later. I have no energy right now.
[27:54] What war have you won?
[27:57] You have only washed four clothes!
[28:00] Don’t you feel sorry for me?
[28:03] I’ll feel even weaker if I wash these heavy sheets in such a condition.
[28:09] There’s nothing special about that, Chanda!
[28:11] All the women do these house chores in this condition!
[28:16] They do. Indeed, they do. And I am doing it too.
[28:19] But I am not feeling well
[28:20] and it’s hurting that’s why I told you I’ll wash these sheets later.
[28:24] I don’t want to hear anything!
[28:26] All these clothes must be washed today! That’s it!
[28:31] What are you taking this revenge for? Why are you doing this?
[28:35] How many times have I told you to keep your volume down?
[28:42] Don’t talk to me in that tone!
[28:46] This is my house! Not your fathers!
[28:50] And how many times have I told you?
[28:52] Not to bring my deceased father in between!
[28:55] Don’t you understand that?
[28:56] I am the one at fault, right? I am the one who’s not working, right?
[28:59] Then say whatever you have to say to me!
[29:01] Next time if you say anything about him, there won’t be anyone worse than me!
[29:04] How dare you! You’ll argue with me? Threaten me? Yeah?
[29:11] I am not threatening you. I am warning you!
[29:14] If you say anything to my father, I won’t take it!
[29:18] Just because I stay quiet and don’t say anything, you don’t think of it as my weakness!
[29:23] I also very well know how to misbehave!
[29:27] Next time, don’t even mistakenly say anything to my father!
[29:31] I am living in this house nicely, right?
[29:33] Then let me! Do you understand!
[29:41] This girl….. How dare you!
[29:47] I will make sure you repent a hundred times!
[29:54] You’ve put bruises on me, right?
[30:03] Now you watch what I do to you!
[30:10] I’ll destroy you! Damage and destroy!
[30:20] Assalam o Alaikum.
[30:21] Walaikum a Salam. Is everything okay? Why are you back so early?
[30:24] Yes, yes. Everything is alright.
[30:26] Actually, my work had finished so I thought I would just come home.
[30:31] Why do you look tensed?
[30:34] I am not tensed. Actually… I wasn’t feeling well. My head was aching a lot so I came.
[30:41] You work day and night. You should take care of yourself.
[30:44] Come, let me give you a massage.
[30:45] No, mom. There’s no need for that
[30:46] I’ll take a medicine, it will be fine.
[30:50] Don’t forget to eat it!
[30:52] And there’s no need to go back to work. Rest in your room.
[30:59] I’ll send tea!
[31:00] There’s no need for that. I am going to sleep.
[31:14] Since when have you become so inefficient?
[31:17] You haven’t been able to find out his house address till now?
[31:20] I should know about those two in today’s date!
[31:23] Do you get it?
[31:26] I say, let’s go and give a dose to his friend one more time.
[31:30] How will he not tell us his address then?
[31:35] Yes, dad? I am coming, I am coming.
[31:37] Babar,
[31:39] water.
[31:42] At least tell me something. What has happened? Everything is fine, right?
[31:49] Your family came to the office trying to look for you.
[31:51] What!
[31:53] Did they misbehave with you?
[31:55] No, they didn’t say anything to me.
[31:58] But they created a scene over there and even hit Umer.
[32:03] He’s very furious right now.
[32:05] He has even told me to not come to work again.
[32:10] Babar, you don’t worry.
[32:14] God will make everything better.
[32:16] A hundred doors open when one door closes.
[32:21] You… you start your own work!
[32:24] It’s not that easy.
[32:27] Babar, no work is easy.
[32:31] But if you have the courage and if you work hard, every task becomes easy.
[32:42] What humans say is right.
[32:46] That only a wife is her husband’s shield.
[32:51] Water.
[32:58] But this shield is very weak in front of these very same people.
[33:02] I don’t know what storm is going to come when those people….
[33:11] How dare that cheap girl!
[33:13] She twisted my wife’s hand? I won’t spare her!
[33:16] Oh, oh, oh! Where are you going!
[33:18] I’ll hold her braids and kick her out!
[33:20] There’s no need for that!
[33:22] You’re going to ruin the entire game if you react so aggressively!
[33:28] I have just gotten a chance.
[33:30] Now, you see. My politics!
[33:33] Politics? But why are you stopping me? What do you want to do?
[33:39] By putting these bruises on my hand,
[33:40] she has stamped her way to the destruction of her life!
[33:45] Now you’ll see the wonders these bruises cause! You just sit and watch the show.
[33:59] Shebi has come.
[34:02] No, no! You don’t call him!
[34:05] His family life will get ruined!
[34:07] It’s important for me to talk to him.
[34:08] He’ll get worried…
[34:10] I… I’ll talk to him. I’ll call him….
[34:13] No, no!
[34:13] What happened?
[34:14] Oh, son. When did you come?
[34:16] What happened, is everything alright?
[34:18] Chanda is fine, right?
[34:19] Yes! Yes.
[34:24] Then what is it?
[34:26] Nothing! Nothing at all.
[34:29] There is something, mama.
[34:32] No, no. There isn’t anything.
[34:35] What happened to you?
[34:37] Nothing, son.
[34:38] Nothing, son.
[34:41] Mama, show me. For my sake, show me!
[34:46] How did this happen?
[34:47] Your wife, Chanda. Actually…
[34:51] What do you mean Chanda?
[34:54] Dad, what do you mean by Chanda?
[34:55] Just some tussle between the mother in law and….
[34:59] Scuffle…
[35:02] Chanda did this?
[35:08] That’s not what she meant to do…
[35:11] Chanda! Chanda!
[35:21] You’re back?
[35:22] Come with me!
[35:24] Where are you taking me!
[35:24] Come!
[35:25] What are you doing? Leave me!
[35:26] Come with me!
[35:26] Leave me!
[35:27] Come with me!
[35:28] I say, leave me!
[35:29] Come downstairs with me!
[35:30] Leave me!
[35:33] What did you do?
[35:35] Why don’t you go and ask your mummy?
[35:37] Just respond to the question I have asked!
[35:39] Only she can give you a better response to this!
[35:40] Chanda, don’t forget that she is my mother!
[35:43] She may say anything. You have no right to misbehave with her!
[35:47] She doesn’t have any right to misbehave with me either!
[35:50] She keeps talking ill about my mom and dad all the time!
[35:54] Dad isn’t even in this world anymore
[35:56] but even then, she blames him for every other thing!
[36:00] You make her understand, I won’t hear a word against my father otherwise…
[36:04] What are you saying?
[36:05] That I should explain to her? Won’t you understand!
[36:08] You don’t understand what I am telling you!
[36:09] Enough!
[36:12] She’s my mother!
[36:14] I could’ve never imagined that you would hurt her!
[36:17] I didn’t do anything!
[36:18] Now, come with me and apologize to her!
[36:19] I haven’t done anything! She’s the one who slapped me!
[36:22] Are you going to apologize to her or…
[36:23] Otherwise what will you do? What will you do? Hit me? Hit me!
[36:27] : Should I tell you what I can do?
[36:28] I haven’t done anything!
[36:29] Should I tell you what I can do!
[36:38] Chanda!
[36:40] Chanda!
[36:41] Chanda!
[36:41] What just happened!
[36:43] Chanda! Dad, take out the car! Take out the car!
[36:46] Dad, take the car out fast!
[36:48] Shebi, what has happened to her?
[36:50] Mama!
[36:52] Chanda….
[36:53] Hurry up!
