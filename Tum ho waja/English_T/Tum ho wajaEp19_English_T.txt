[00:46] Mom, my stomach is hurting..
[00:49] What happened? I had told you not to start eating spicy food so soon
[00:53] and you don’t listen..
[00:55] I think he’s suffering from indigestion, mom give him some medicine
[00:58] The medicine is in my.. I mean to say in the cupboard in your room.
[01:03] Erum, take out the medicine and give it to him
[01:12] Babar!
[01:13] Yes! I’ll be back in two minutes..
[01:16] I’m leaving, I’ll come some other day..
[01:18] No no, please have your tea.
[01:19] I’m coming in two minutes, just two minutes. Please.
[01:21] Okay. I’ll keep sitting here then..
[01:40] Sitara..
[01:43] Why are you here..
[01:45] Why have you started being frightened around me?
[01:48] Please go from here. Why have you come?
[01:51] I brought chocolates for you, look..
[01:56] : I don’t want anything. Please go inside.
[01:59] Okay sure.
[02:01] I will give you anything you want, you want gold?
[02:04] I don’t want anything!
[02:05] I will give it to you..
[02:05] Nothing! I don't want anything!
[02:07] I will give you anything you want..
[02:08] What are you doing?
[02:13] What is happening?
[02:16] What’s happening?
[02:17] If you are invited somewhere with respect
[02:20] then you mustn't forget to show respect for yourself and to the people of the house.
[02:23] What has happened? What have I done?
[02:25] Tell me? What have I done?
[02:26] You know exactly what I'm talking about! Don't do this next time.
[02:30] Leave my collar!
[02:33] I won’t spare you! And you too!
[02:37] Move!
[02:55] We were up all night, right Ikram?
[02:59] Where is Shahab? Call him..
[03:02] Shebi! Shebi was home all day then he got a call,
[03:07] his friend got into an accident and is in the ICU. That's what it was right?
[03:11] Yes yes..
[03:11] He hasn't come back yet. Find out.
[03:13] Accident? I hope everything is okay?
[03:16] Yes yes.. We should serve the food now..
[03:18] Should I serve the food then?
[03:20] No, I’m not hungry yet..
[03:21] We have made a lot of cuisines like italian, chinese
[03:27] and you’re saying you won’t eat?
[03:31] All of us will eat together when Shahab comes..
[03:33] Shebi will come..
[03:34] I was saying then we had enough of hunting..
[03:38] I got hurt on the shoulder..
[03:50] How can he leave without informing us? Listen, where is Mr. Wajid?
[03:59] What happened to her?
[04:02] I don't know what has happened to her..
[04:04] Mr. Wajid has left and I think something happened..
[04:23] What could have happened..
[04:25] Ask Sitara what has happened..
[04:28] What do you mean? How would she know?
[04:30] She means to say that Sitara and he must have said something to Mr. Wajid
[04:34] otherwise he wouldn't have left without informing us.
[04:37] It’s pretty obvious that all of them didn't like that Mr. Wajid came here.
[04:42] Babar, I had told you before that you should plan the dinner somewhere outside.
[04:45] Now a scene has been created..
[04:46] One minute, I’ll call and ask him..
[05:01] Sitara?
[05:07] What happened?
[05:10] Has something happened? What happened, tell me..
[05:14] What happened
[05:35] I think we should get going, it’s getting late.
[05:37] What we came to talk to you about has been done.
[05:42] I think we should pick a date of this month and get them married on that date.
[05:46] And besides I am very restless now, I want you to become my daughter in law and come home soon.
[05:57] He’s here! Shebi! Shebi! Look who is here, Ikram uncle and his daughter Sana. You remember right?
[06:09] Hi Shahab,
[06:12] how are you?
[06:14] Uncle told me about the accident, is everything okay?
[06:20] Asalam o alikum.
[06:23] Shake his hand.
[06:43] What are you looking at?
[06:51] Chanda..
[06:54] No no Shebi, this is not Chanda.
[07:02] You’re laughing.
[07:06] You’re making fun of me.
[07:10] You killed my child right?
[07:12] What?
[07:14] Then why are you alive yourself?
[07:16] Shebi!
[07:16] Shahab, what are you saying?
[07:17] Why don’t you just die? Why don’t you just die?
[07:20] Let’s go! Let’s go!
[07:21] Make him sit! Make him sit!
[07:23] Get out!
[07:24] Let’s go from here! Let’s go!
[07:25] Get out! Get out of here!
[07:28] : I told you before, this is not the right place!
[07:30] Did you take a look at that boy!
[07:31] Ikram..
[07:32] Uncle, please let me handle this..
[07:34] Okay handle..
[07:37] Listen..
[07:37] Carefully son..
[07:38] What’s wrong mama? Get out of here! Get out!
[07:45] Did she leave?
[07:48] Move! Put some water on his head..
[07:50] What do you mean by put water..
[07:53] I will sit here only, this is my house!
[07:55] Shebi..
[07:55] Get out of here!
[07:57] Enough..
[07:58] What do they say mama? We’ve stopped causing pain to our heart.
[08:02] You humiliated me!
[08:04] Ikram left and he.. Lie down, why don’t you just lie down here..
[08:08] Mama, you should also stop..
[08:12] Stop it, you won’t gain anything.
[08:14] Come on, stand up..
[08:16] It was better if you would’ve hit me with this shoe!
[08:21] My young boy..
[08:22] Why don’t you move the bed here only.. He left.. The whole plan got ruined..
[08:26] Shebi..
[08:27] Shh, Do this Shh only..
[08:29] Quiet, everyone quiet.. Enough, enough son..
[09:01] I feel like killing Wajid
[09:07] and get rid of all the problems by bringing Sitara here.
[09:24] Get out! Get out of here!
[09:26] But uncle..
[09:26] Get out of here!
[09:28] Uncle..
[09:32] Sitara and he must have said something to Mr. Wajid
[09:35] otherwise he wouldn't have left without informing us.
[10:01] I am telling you for the last time that Shebi is not worthy of you.
[10:06] You are destroying your life for no reason because of your stubbornness.
[10:10] Papa, you have promised me. You can't go on your word now okay?
[10:15] Goodnight.
[10:17] Sana. Sana, listen to me. Sana!
[10:30] Babar, take a look at this. Mr. Wajid has given such a nice watch.
[10:35] : Keep it, I’ll take a look at it later.
[10:38] What’s the matter? Atleast talk to me nicely..
[10:46] Whatever happened, shouldn't have.
[10:48] I think Mr. Wajid has realised that everyone’s behavior with him wasn’t nice.
[10:54] Maybe it wasn’t what you think.
[10:57] There’s a chance that he actually got a call and he left due to some important work.
[11:01] That’s not possible
[11:04] because he could have received at least one call.
[11:06] I've been calling him since so long now..
[11:08] What are you trying to say then? That maybe sitara?
[11:14] That’s possible too,
[11:17] Sitara is the  youngest but she has a sharp tongue,
[11:21] she has no respect for elders.
[11:25] I'm sure she must have said something and Mr. Wajid got upset and he left.
[11:31] I’m just worried about the fact that how will I face Mr. Wajid..
[11:38] Let’s one thing Babar,
[11:40] we have to go to the state agent for our shop in the morning
[11:44] so we’ll leave a little early and meet Mr. Wajid as well.
[11:47] But what will we do if he is really upset about something?
[11:52] We’ll apologize to him, what’s the big deal about that?
[11:57] You’re getting worried for no reason.
[11:58] Don’t take too much stress. Everything will be fine.
[12:12] The queen is sleeping.
[12:19] Wake up! Chanda!
[12:25] I hope she’s not dead. Go bring water quickly.
[12:28] A new issue will rise otherwise..
[12:33] Come quickly Tara! Sprinkle water on her.
[12:39] Sprinkle more water.
[12:43] She’s moving
[12:45] Wake up nuisance!
[12:49] We’ll be rid of her if she dies.
[12:55] She wont die so easily..
[12:58] She has made our lives hell.
[13:01] You two have made our lives hell..
[13:05] She started taking as soon as she gained consciousness..
[13:07] Why are you doing this?
[13:13] You have filled so much poison in Shahabs heart
[13:17] that he doesn't even want to see my face.
[13:21] Do you have any fear of God in your heart?
[13:23] Do you have any fear of God that your trapped our only son?
[13:27] Whatever we are doing is right.
[13:29] You may think it's wrong but we’re doing right by our son.
[13:32] Thank god he hates you.
[13:34] Who will believe you?
[13:36] You’ve run away from home,
[13:38] who will listen to you?
[13:39] You don't have anyone to rely on
[13:41] Listen to me, you have to do one thing,
[13:46] be quiet..quiet. Don't speak okay?
[13:50] Why are you doing this?
[13:52] Why are you doing this? What have I done
[13:55] Be quiet! Quiet..
[13:58] Don't make any noise..
[13:59] Good girl okay? Good girl. Go to sleep, you’re sleepy. Send some food for her.
[14:05] Will you eat?
[14:06] Lie done.
[14:17] Not a word.
[14:26] Stop with your drama. Get up and come outside.
[14:29] Be thankful that you get food to eat two times a day.
[14:36] Come outside.
[14:56] Nothing! I don't want anything!
[14:57] will give you anything you want..
[14:58] What are you doing?
[15:08] That slap will cost you Sitara.
[15:15] I must make you mine now.
[15:41] Sitara, move, I want to iron my clothes.
[15:44] Mom has to go to the doctor, wait for a little while.
[15:47] Our commitment is more important than the doctor. Move!
[15:52] Who are you showing this attitude to?
[15:56] I’ll show you what I can do, you won’t listen otherwise.
[15:59] Move.
[16:00] What..
[16:00] Babar! Babar! Babar, take a look at what Sitara did!
[16:05] What happened? Why are you shouting?
[16:07] What happened?
[16:07] Babar, your sister has gone mad!
[16:09] She burnt my hand.
[16:11] . I had only asked her to give me mom’s clothes, I’ll iron them but take a look at what she did.
[16:17] You’re lying, you’re so vicious..
[16:20] Have you gone mad!
[16:22] Are you in your senses? You’re going to raise your hand on your sister?
[16:25] And what are you standing here for? Go to your room!
[16:27] Mom, I really didn’t..
[16:29] All I see is you causing trouble all the time,
[16:31] you’ve ruined the peace of this house!
[16:33] Go!
[16:42] Do you see her behavior? Please make her understand.
[16:45] Look, she burnt my hand so bad..
[16:47] Come, I’ll apply paste on this, come..
[18:29] I didn’t expect this from you.
[18:35] Trust me, I was restless the whole night.
[18:39] I kept wanting for it to be the next morning somehow
[18:44] and so that I meet you and ask you..
[18:47] Ask me what? Did I do something to offend you?
[18:51] How can we get offended by you?
[18:54] I was just worried to see that you left so suddenly yesterday..
[19:00] Actually… I got an important phone call so I had to leave in urgency.
[19:05] Really?
[19:07] I was very worried.
[19:09] Thinking maybe you got offended by us.
[19:12] Oh no, son. Why would I get upset with you guys?
[19:15] I was just about to call you myself. But you’ve also brought our daughter in law along.
[19:19] I had to take Erum for shopping so we thought of visiting you along the way.
[19:24] That’s very nice!
[19:26] So then you do one thing.
[19:27] How long will you keep roaming around with her on a motorcycle?
[19:31] Take my car
[19:32] and when you’re done with your outing, can you give it back?
[19:36] No, no. there’s no need for that, Wajid Sahib. It’s not a problem.
[19:39] Babar!
[19:40] Babar, it doesn’t look nice saying no if he’s insisting so much.
[19:47] Yes!
[19:50] Listen. Tell the driver to give the white car’s key to Babar. He’s coming.
[19:55] Aapi! Aapi! Open the door! Open the door, Aapi! Aapi!
[20:00] Don’t do such a thing that we might not be able to give answers for!
[20:06] Nothing that big has happened that you’re sitting inside with the door locked!
[20:10] Open the door!
[20:14] You think this is a petty issue?
[20:18] I’m not sad about the fact that Bhai raised his hand on me
[20:22] but about the fact that you held me accountable for it!
[20:26] When did I say that?
[20:28] So then why did you scold me in front of everyone?
[20:30] Because you’re my own! I can scold you and you won’t take offence!
[20:37] I didn’t do anything!
[20:39] I didn’t do anything wrong. She’s falsely accusing me!
[20:44] She just wants to cause issues between Bhai and us. That’s it.
[20:52] Don’t keep such things in your heart.
[20:55] The circumstances will get uglier and we won’t be able to live in the same house!
[20:59] You guys understand, right?
[21:01] Alright, mom. I won’t trouble you anymore.
[21:04] I won’t give you a chance to complain either.
[22:10] I’m practicing English and he’s acting like a Romeo?
[22:17] Getting intoxicated?
[22:19] Did you only have last night to get drunk?
[22:24] Dad, it was just with my friends last night….
[22:26] Friends?
[22:27] Friends for money!
[22:30] Don’t you dare sit with these goons again!
[22:33] What has happened to you!
[22:35] I’m not a kid anymore. I have grown up!
[22:37] Oh, then grow up! Grow up, please! Act like a grown up then!
[22:42] Gone are the luxuries! Finished!
[22:44] Now show us and become something!
[22:50] Come, come, come… Sana. Come!
[22:57] Hi.
[22:58] Shebi! Say sorry.
[23:03] Last night, you drink very much and misbehaved. Say sorry!
[23:09] Yes, son. We’re sorry for whatever happened last night.
[23:17] Sorry.
[23:22] Uncle,
[23:24] if you don’t mind… I’d like to speak to Shahab in private.
[23:34] Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
[23:37] We go. We go to. Shebi! Shake hand. Okay. Bye.
[24:07] The same anger, the same eyes and that same arrogance!
[24:17] You haven’t changed a bit.
[24:21] You’re exactly the same.
[24:29] Shahab,
[24:32] look at me at least.
[24:38] Please?
[24:47] Mom!
[24:49] What happened?
[24:51] I saw Aapi in my dream. She was crying a lot!
[24:57] A dream is just a dream, right? You don’t worry,
[25:01] your Aapi is absolutely fine in her home.
[25:04] how do you know? Did you go to meet her?
[25:10] My heart says that she’s very happy at her house
[25:18] Is she really that happy over there that she’s forgotten everyone over here?
[25:35] You do know why I’ve come back in your life, right?
[25:42] Yes!
[25:45] Your or my dad wants to get us married.
[25:49] Not dad, me!
[25:51] He never wanted me to get married to you.
[25:54] That’s what I want! Shahab, I want to marry you.
[25:59] But now... what do you want?
[26:02] That’s the only thing that I need to know.
[26:08] What do I want?
[26:13] you know how much I like you, right?
[26:18] I left the country when you rejected me the first time.
[26:23] I won’t go anywhere this time.
[26:26] I’ll wait for you my entire life, Shahab.
[26:31] Do you know how much I love you?
[26:43] I know! It’s Chanda because of whom you didn’t marry me, right?
[26:50] Who is she? Who the hell is she!
[26:53] I am Chanda!
[27:05] Shahab’s wife!
[27:09] What?
[27:18] She’s not my wife.
[27:33] you have forgotten.
[27:36] I am still married to you.
[27:40] So let’s end this relationship right now.
[27:44] You can’t end a soulful relationship with words.
[27:55] I made a mistake.
[27:59] I don’t know what got into me that I decided to marry her.
[28:04] You also love me, right?
[28:08] But I never understood that.
[28:12] You never got married only for me?
[28:17] It’s great! Isn’t it true what they say…?
[28:23] You name your whole life after the one person you fall in love with.
[28:33] I will marry you!
[28:38] You don’t have any objections, right?
[28:47] Let me call uncle right now and apologize to him.
[28:52] Okay?
[29:15] Plenty of men take decisions under influence.
[29:20] And then they’re pushed to marry.
[29:24] You know what I mean, right?
[29:28] But I’ll show you how to be a daughter in law of a respectable family!
[29:39] He will not marry you!
[29:46] He only loves me!
[29:51] And that’s why I’m here today.
[29:57] Really?
[30:01] Challenge accepted!
[30:06] Let the show begin!
[30:41] So I… wanted to ask for something from you.
[30:47] What do I even have that I can give to you?
[30:50] e only thing I had was my existence and I have already given that to you.
[30:55] What else do you want?
[30:59] Actually…. I’m very upset because of whatever happened between you and Sitara.
[31:08] Babar, I try my best!
[31:11] But I don’t know why she dislikes me so much. I really don’t understand!
[31:14] I understand that you’re trying your best.
[31:18] It’s a new atmosphere, new people.
[31:21] It does get hard to understand them.
[31:23] But I am certain,
[31:24] all the matters will get solved if you and Sitara become friends.
[31:30] you don’t worry, Babar.
[31:32] I’ll try my best to make Sitara understand.
[31:35] Thank you!
[31:37] Oh! Have your coconut water.
[31:39] Do you know it’s a nice thing,
[31:41] you should try a little so the house’s atmosphere stays positive
[31:46] Everyone stays happy and we talk about nice things….
[31:48] Babar!
[31:49] What happened?
[31:49] Babar, let’s go from where.
[31:50] But what happened all of a sudden? We have just ordered the food…
[31:52] Babar, what am I telling you? Please, let’s go from here!
[31:54] You’re getting worried because of him?
[32:00] It’s nice that he’s here. I’ll go and talk to him. Let’s get it over with…
[32:03] Wait!
[32:04] What has gotten into you?
[32:05] You don’t know him!
[32:06] He’s a very dangerous person, he’ll kill us!
[32:09] I’m here with you, right?
[32:10] Trust me on this. We should talk to him today!
[32:13] Babar, please for my sake, let’s go!
[32:14] But…
[32:15] No ifs and buts, nothing! I don’t want to hear anything. Let’s go, please!
[32:18] Why are you doing this!
[32:21] How much time is left for your flight to take off?
[32:24] Dad, the flight is in 6 hours
[32:25] but you’re supposed to reach the airport 3 hours before time.
[32:28] Really?
[32:29] Either my watch has stopped working or the time just isn’t passing.
[32:35] Dad?
[32:37] What happened!
[32:38] There’s one thing.
[32:41] I don’t know how to say it to you.
[32:43] I’ll give you one slap!
[32:45] You’re hesitating? That too with me?
[32:50] You have to go to Tayi Jaan and ask for Sitara’s proposal for me.
[33:08] Danish, how did this thought cross your mind?
[33:13] Dad, I have liked Sitara for a long time.
[33:16] I never made it visible.
[33:18] I was just waiting for the right time, that’s it.
[33:22] You’re a big secret keeper!
[33:26] And Tayi Jaan knows this from before.
[33:31] Really?
[33:37] Alright!
[33:41] You don’t worry.
[33:44] And anyway I wanted you to get married soon
[33:50] so our house becomes a little lively too.
[33:53] And who can be a better daughter in law than Sitara?
[34:00] thank you, dad!
[34:01] Dad, can I go and say my goodbyes to Tayi Jaan?
[34:05] Yes, yes. Go!
[34:06] Okay, dad!
[34:25] Silly!
[34:28] I wanted to get him married into a big wealthy family and he chose Sitara? Huh!
[34:51] Carefully, son!
[34:59] Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car!
[35:05] I’ll drive the car.
[35:06] I’ll drive it!
[35:07] Didn’t I just say I’ll drive it…
[35:08] I said the same, right?
[35:21] Chanda!
[35:25] Yes?
[35:26] What rubbish did you say to Sana?
[35:28] Tell me what you said!
[35:30] I didn’t say anything wrong.
[35:33] Whatever I said is the truth.
[35:36] Nobody can come between me and Shahab!
[35:41] And who’s going to stop?
[35:43] You?
[35:44] You aren’t worth two pennies!
[35:48] That’s it, that’s enough!
[35:54] You test my patience so much otherwise….
[35:56] What? What will you do? What will you do?
[36:00] Leave me!
[36:00] Tell me! What will you do?
[36:05] What are you doing!
[36:06] Mom!
[36:08] You? Where did you come from?
[36:12] And how did you enter my house?
[36:14] It’s good that I came!
[36:15] Otherwise I never would’ve known the torture my daughter is put through!
