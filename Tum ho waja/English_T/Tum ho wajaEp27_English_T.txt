[00:51] She’s sleeping right now..
[00:52] Go wake her up then..
[00:55] Dad..
[01:00] Such a time has come that you’ll lie to your own father.
[01:03] What do you think? We’re foolish? We don’t understand?
[01:10] Sorry..
[01:12] You took her to her house?
[01:14] No no, we went to Muraad uncle’s, Chanda was getting very worried.
[01:22] Do we have any value left in your life?
[01:25] Dad, what are you saying..
[01:29] I had never thought, I had never thought that my only dear son will disrespect me like this.
[01:34] I have always put his happiness first, his stubbornness,
[01:35] I have always done what he wanted in life! No! He didn’t value us! No!
[01:45] Dad, what has happened..
[01:45] I am fed up now!
[01:50] Your dad will listen to nothing.
[01:53] But mama..
[01:53] No ifs and buts.
[01:56] You didn’t value anything we said?
[02:01] I pray that you don’t have any regrets Shebi.
[02:08] Mama!
[02:09] Mama please listen to me!
[02:16] The father who died listening to taunts because of her,
[02:19] she didn’t come to see him. I will kill her. I won’t let her live.
[02:24] No! You won’t do that. You have to stay strong.
[02:35] Your father left, now you have to become the father for your brother and sisters.
[02:45] Maybe everything had to happen this way..
[02:56] Nobody has any control on death.
[03:03] Accept God’s will.
[03:10] People will keep on talking,
[03:14] you just keep your mind and eyes open.
[03:20] Think hard before making any decision.
[03:32] Forgive me mom.. I misbehaved so much with you, I hurt you.. Please forgive me..
[03:41] I promise I will always take care of you.
[03:45] I will become a good son and show you. I will never leave you alone. Tell me you forgive me.
[04:04] Mom is in a deep sleep, just try that she doesn’t get disturbed.
[04:12] And..
[04:23] I know what you are going through right now
[04:29] but we are the ones who have to take care of this family now.
[04:33] Who will take care of mom if you’ll keep crying like this?
[04:47] Mr. Wajid, Asalam o alikum.
[04:48] Walikum Salam. How are you?
[04:49] Absolutely fine. Please come..
[04:54] Asalam o alikum.
[04:54] Walikum Salam. How are you Sitara? May god give you all strength and patience.
[05:01] Amen.
[05:01] Don’t feel alone, I am with you all.
[05:08] This is some money, keep it.
[05:11] No sir, we’re not in need of money at all. We just need your prayers and love.
[05:16] My prayers and love is with you all but this is Mansoor’s money, I had to give it.
[05:23] He’s no more but it’s his possession, keep it. Keep it.
[05:34] Thank you sir. Give it to mom.
[05:42] Hello?
[05:44] Yes, alright fine.
[05:47] Mr. Wajid, a friend of mien is here. He’s at the gate, I’ll be back in two minutes.
[05:52] I’ll also come..
[05:52] No no sir, please have tea before going.
[05:54] Sitara, make tea for Mr. Wajid. I’ll be back in two minutes.
[06:03] Sitara, look.. don’t worry. I am here for you, if you ever need money, I’ll give it to you. Okay?
[06:30] If you’re satisfied then send her.
[06:33] I’ll call her but you’ll have to supervise her until my order gets complete.
[06:39] Alright, I’ll do it.
[06:40] I’m leaving then..
[06:41] You could have at least had tea..
[06:43] There is no need for tea. I’ll leave, it’s getting very late. You also get there soon.
[06:47] I’ll leave as soon as Mr. Wajid leaves.
[06:49] Alright okay.
[06:55] Where is Sitara..
[07:35] Where is she..
[07:37] Here’s your tea uncle..
[07:38] Thank you so much. Thank you. Where did Sitara go off to?
[07:43] She’s right there in the kitchen.
[07:45] Sorry it took more time with the friend.
[07:48] It’s okay.
[07:50] Please have tea..
[07:53] What? A job in Dubai? Oh wow! My fierce son, you made me so happy!
[08:04] But dad, I won’t go..
[08:09] What? What did you say?
[08:11] That I won’t go to Dubai to work.
[08:14] Have you gone mad? Are you in your senses?
[08:18] Dad, I am working here already..
[08:20] Danish, what’s the point of such a job which is only supporting our basic needs?
[08:25] You’ll have three to four times more salary if you’ll go to Dubai. Both our lives will be set.
[08:32] Dad, life is set if we live with family
[08:35] and besides what’s the point of earning money while staying away from family?
[08:39] Oh please!
[08:41] Thinking highly of yourself and saying you’re going to take care of people..
[08:45] Listen to me, a person is respected if he has money, respect is there if you have money.
[08:53] I don’t need such kind of respect dad.
[08:56] Danish, why aren’t you understanding?
[08:58] People work hard for years to go to Dubai, they save and spend money and then go to Dubai.
[09:07] Fate itself is being kind to my son,
[09:09] the job opportunity has presented itself and you’re ready to kick it away.
[09:12] Yes because it’s better than the struggles I’m going to face there.
[09:16] That means you don’t care about your father?
[09:18] Dad, I am not going because of you. I want to stay here and take care of everyone.
[09:25] Don’t talk nonsense! ‘I want to take care of everyone’! Foolish boy!
[09:30] I’ll look for a nice job and earn a lot of money. You don’t worry
[09:55] Mom, you’re awake. I’ve brought tea for you..
[10:01] What time is it?
[10:03] It’s evening.
[10:06] It has gotten so late. I didn’t know, I was in a deep sleep.
[10:11] That’s a good thing then.
[10:15] Where is Zain?
[10:16] He’s in the other room.
[10:19] And Babar?
[10:22] Mom, eat it. You have to have medicine.
[10:25] Tell me where Babar is.
[10:27] He has gone out for work and he gave this money for the house expenses
[10:33] and Wajid uncle gave this..
[10:37] What is this?
[10:38] He said it’s dad’s possession.
[10:42] Mansoor never mentioned such a thing.
[10:48] I am here for you, if you ever need money, I’ll give it to you. Okay?
[11:01] Has something happened? Did Babar say anything?
[11:05] Nobody has said anything. It’s just Wajid uncle..
[11:13] What did he say?
[11:15] Nothing, he didn’t say anything. I don’t like him coming here.
[11:33] Your designs are very nice but I feel they’re old fashioned.
[11:39] Designs and trends are changing all over the world. We want our work to show those trends.
[11:48] Yes.
[11:51] There is no need to worry. There are some references in here I’ve marked.
[11:56] Take a look at them and work on them.
[11:59] Sure. Alright sir.
[12:01] We should compliment her in front of her but she’s intelligent, she has brains.
[12:05] All we need to see is how quickly you’ll pick our style.
[12:10] Yes sir, Inshallah I will try my best.
[12:14] I’ll go check inside.
[13:07] What is it Chanda? Why are you bothering me by calling again and again?
[13:09] Where are you?
[13:10] I’ve been calling you since so long, you’re not answering, you keep cutting my call.
[13:12] What has happened?
[13:14] I have come to see a friend for some work.
[13:19] Are you okay? Why do you seem upset? Tell me what it is?
[13:26] Why are you behaving like this?
[13:28] Everything is fine. What has happened to you? I’ll talk to you once I’m home.
[13:33] I..
[13:50] Zain, why are you sitting here alone?
[13:53] Just like that mom..
[13:56] Why are you crying?
[13:59] Nothing mom..
[14:04] I miss dad..
[14:12] Look Zain, you’re not supposed to do this. You have to make yourself stronger.
[14:23] If you’ll do this then who will take care of me?
[14:29] Who will take of Sitara? Make yourself brave. You won’t cry next time. Promise me
[14:40] Yes mom.
[15:29] What are you doing?
[15:32] I am hungry..
[15:34] If you were hungry then you could have eaten something else, was it important to eat this?
[15:39] I felt like eating it.
[15:43] You felt like it.. Don’t you know that you’re not supposed to eat this in this condition?
[15:49] I’ve never heard of such a thing.
[15:54] You would have known if you had gotten good teachings at home.
[16:01] What do you think? I am asking you not to eat this on purpose?
[16:08] Mummy, why are you making a big deal out of a small matter?
[16:17] I am making a big deal out of a small matter?
[16:22] Do you have any idea what kind of an affect this can have on your baby to be?
[16:27] If you can’t take care of yourself, at least take care of your baby to be!
[16:34] Sorry. I made a mistake. I’ll be careful next time.
[16:41] As if you will.
[16:44] Just like you’ve been careful about other things.
[16:51] Father and son are upset with each other because of you.
[16:58] You are very stubborn Chanda.
[17:01] I know, I know you oppress Shebi.
[17:11] Listen to me very carefully Chanda,
[17:17] this obstinate behavior of yours won’t happen. Do you understand?
[17:25] Enough is enough.
[17:41] What is it? You look worried..
[17:44] I am not worried. I have gotten a job offer from Dubai but I declined it, I won’t go.
[17:52] Why?
[18:11] I don’t think it’s appropriate of me to leave you all like this..
[18:18] You’re thinking is absolutely wrong.
[18:26] I’ll go check.
[18:34] Who is it?
[18:36] Aunty! Aunty! Zain has collapsed outside!
[18:38] Where? Take me!
[18:43] Come on! Make space! Hurry! Fast!
[18:47] Zain! Zain, son…
[18:50] Mom, one second… water!
[18:51] Open your eyes.
[18:53] Open your eyes, son!
[18:54] Open your eyes! Zain! Why isn’t he opening his eyes?
[18:58] Take him to the hospital! He isn’t coming to his senses!
[19:01] Let’s go. I’m coming with you!
[19:02] Mom, you can’t come! You’re in your period of waiting! You’re not supposed to leave the house!
[19:25] You made this?
[19:27] Yes.
[19:30] It’s very nice!
[19:32] Thank you.
[19:33] What’s your name?
[19:34] Erum. My name is Erum.
[19:36] Erum!
[19:37] Erum, tell me. What additions can you make in this?
[19:40] Sir, I was thinking if we could do the same work on its borders
[19:45] and give this cut to the sleeves then it’ll look better.
[19:49] That’s a very nice idea! You add these to it and bring it to me.
[19:52] Sir, if you give me the permission, could I show it to you tomorrow? It’s gotten very late today.
[19:58] Yes, of course. You go.
[20:00] Thank you.
[20:04] Yes, Sitara?
[20:04] Bhai, Zain’s health is getting really bad. We have brought him to the hospital…
[20:08] What! What has happened to him?
[20:09] I don’t know, Bhai. It happened all of a sudden. You please come as soon as possible.
[20:13] I am coming! I’m coming.
[20:20] Chanda! Chanda!
[20:24] What happened? Why did it take you so long to come back…
[20:26] What happened? Why are you bothering me with your constant calls?
[20:29] Where were you? I have been waiting for you since so long…
[20:30] I went out with my friends. Now tell me, what is the problem?
[20:34] You weren’t home but over here I found out that….
[20:36] What? What happened?
[20:39] That…. Mama told me right now
[20:42] that us going over there has led to you and dad not speaking to each other.
[20:45] Yes, there had been a problem but I have handled the situation!
[20:50] Chanda, please! Know one thing.
[20:54] You won’t be stubborn about meeting your family after today!
[20:58] This is our life now and this is how we have to spend it
[21:07] Alright! Look over here. Why are you behaving like this?
[21:14] I will do as you say. I will listen to everything that you tell me.
[21:20] Just once. For the last time, listen to me. Please.
[21:32] Alright, say it.
[21:41] I want to meet Zain and Sitara for the last time…
[21:44] What has happened to you! Do you not understand one thing?
[21:49] Why are you torturing me!
[21:54] What did you say? I am the one who’s torturing you?
[21:57] Yes, you are!
[21:58] I am the one who’s getting tortured, Shahab!
[22:02] I did not dream of a life like this one!
[22:04] Some dreams turn into reality and some don’t!
[22:08] Now this is your life! You have to live in this and die in this too!
[22:12] It would be better for you if you understand that! Do you understand?
[22:53] Doctor, what has happened to my brother?
[22:55] Actually, he has had an appendix problem. We will have to operate him before….
[23:00] Before what?
[23:01] If we don’t operate him right now, the poison can spread in the entire body.
[23:03] No, no! You make the preparations for the operation as soon as possible.
[23:06] You tell me, what am I supposed to do?
[23:07] You go and get the file made fast!
[23:32] Patients name?
[23:34] Zain. Zain Mansoor.
[23:42] Sign over here. You will have to deposit 30 percent of the amount right now.
[23:47] Right now? Right now… Money….
[23:51] I kept the money that Wajid uncle gave to me this morning.
[23:54] Alright. You… you go.
[24:00] The money is here. You please fill out all the other details.
[24:38] Oh God please save my son
[24:42] Everything will be fine! All of us are praying
[24:51] I can't understand, what to do. From where will I arrange the money
[24:56] Don't worry brother, I will try my best to help you out
[25:14] Nothing will happen to him! We are praying for him, he will be fine!
[26:57] Babar.
[26:58] Assalam o Alaikum.
[26:59] Walaikum a Salam. How is Zain?
[27:03] The surgery is going on right now.
[27:05] Surgery?
[27:08] What surgery?
[27:10] Appendix, uncle.
[27:14] What? How did this happen? He was fine. Then why all of a sudden?
[27:18] I don’t know, dad.
[27:19] He went to play outside. He felt some pain and fainted all of a sudden.
[27:24] His friends told us when they came home.
[27:27] Alright.
[27:30] How long has it been since the operation started?
[27:32] It has taken longer I don’t know why.
[27:35] Make Allah protect him.
[27:37] Bhai, go and find out if everything is okay. It has been so long.
[27:44] Doctor, how is my brother now?
[27:47] Thank God, the operation has been successful.
[27:52] Thank God.
[28:16] Bhai! Got a call from the reception.
[28:17] Why?
[28:18] They were saying that we need to deposit 2 and a half lacs as soon as possible.
[28:21] 2 and a half lacs? But they told me that the bill was for eighty thousand?
[28:25] That is what I said to them too. But they said that this wasn’t a normal surgery.
[28:29] Due to the appendix bursting, they had to operate a bigger surgery.
[28:32] ICU bill, medication and everything else combine has cost this much. What will happen now?
[28:38] Nothing will happen. How can they make such big bill like that?
[28:41] Two and a half lacs. I’ll go ask them.
[28:44] Where is mom?
[28:44] Mom is praying.
[28:46] And uncle?
[28:47] He went downstairs.
[28:49] Alright. Don’t worry. I’ll ask them and come back.
[28:56] Yes, dad? I am coming. I have picked the cash. I am coming in two minutes. You don’t want it?
[29:02] Alright, I’m coming. Just two minutes.
[29:09] I will also come with you.
[29:13] You cannot go!
[29:18] I told you, right? I will come with you.
[29:22] What is it? What’s your problem? Please, try to understand me!
[29:44] Chanda.
[29:45] Chanda! Listen to me!
[29:46] Chanda! Listen to me!
[29:53] I love you. I don’t want to separate you but it’s important for me to listen to dad otherwise…
[30:05] Otherwise?
[30:07] Otherwise what!
[30:08] Otherwise, it’ll get really difficult!
[30:12] What difficulty will there be?
[30:13] Chanda, it is not just about you and me.
[30:16] We have to think about our unborn child too now! I want to do a lot of things for him.
[30:27] Please! You will be by my side, right?
[30:33] Baba is in a campaign right now, I am going with him. We are going together right now.
[30:39] I will keep calling you. And if I am unable to attend yours, please leave me a message.
[30:48] Take care of yourself and get ready at night. We’ll go out for dinner.
[31:02] And yes!
[31:11] I am sorry for whatever happened yesterday.
[31:34] Mama and dad must be waiting for you. You go. I will wait for you.
[32:22] Obviously mom, we cannot fight with them on it. We will have to pay the bill, we cannot go like this.
[32:32] From where will we arrange this much money?
[32:36] I don't know, even I am thinking the same...
[32:42] Uncle
[32:48] Do you have some money to lend?
[32:56] No, I don't...
[33:01] I don't have anything,
honestly speaking I am
[33:05] feeling very ashamed
of myself for the first time
[33:12] What sort of uncle am I? I can't do anything for my nephew
[33:26] Babar, I can arrange upto 50,000 only
[33:40] If I had some jewelery...
[33:43] You think that I would have let you sell the jewelery?
[33:48] We are poor but we are not shameless
[33:53] I will arrange the money, you just don't
need to worry. I am your elder son, I will do
[34:03] everything. You stay here, take care of him.
I'll go and make arrangements for the money.
[34:17] Danish in the meantime you get the money too
[35:00] Hello?
[35:02] Yes, Umar?
[35:05] Really? Yes, alright.
[35:07] I’ll be there as soon as possible. Yes, yes, as soon as possible. Thank you.
[35:26] Did you see, uncle?
[35:28] This is why my heart had been restless since morning.
[35:30] I could feel that something bad was about to happen, I was feeling anxious
[35:33] and look it happened!
[35:34] He is alright, right? Nothing happened to him, right?
[35:37] Look, my child. I don’t tell you everything that’s going on over here so you get worried.
[35:42] What are you saying, uncle?
[35:46] You are the only one who considers me as your own.
[35:49] Everyone else has distanced from me like I was never related to them?
[35:55] Uncle, I don’t understand anything! What should I do!
[36:00] I try to fix everything every time thinking everything will be fine
[36:03] but everything goes wrong!
[36:06] My child, there is one way.
[36:10] What is it?
[36:15] The hospitals bill over here has become a lot.
[36:20] My child, if you could somehow arrange one and a half lac….
[36:27] Then you can win everyone’s heart. Everyone’s.
[36:32] One and a half lac rupees?
[36:37] Where will I get so much money from, uncle?
[36:41] My child, talk to Shebi. If he does something, everything will be fine.
