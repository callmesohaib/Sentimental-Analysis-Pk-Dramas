[00:43] Do you know? The guy that your son has hit is in ICU right now.
[00:49] You just pray that he survives otherwise your son will be hung for sure.
[00:58] Only you can do something, sir!
[01:01] You… please, get him out of here somehow! He’s completely innocent!
[01:05] It’s not in my hands anymore. I can’t help you in any way.
[01:09] Can I meet my son?
[01:13] Actually, the investigation is going on right now
[01:15] and no one is permitted to meet during that.
[01:19] I won’t leave without meeting my son!
[01:21] What language do you understand, miss?
[01:23] Didn’t I just say you can’t meet your son?
[01:26] So that means that you can’t!
[01:28] I won’t go from here!
[01:31] Saifullah!
[01:34] Yes sir!
[01:35] Saifullah, get her out of here.
[01:37] I won’t go from here!
[01:38] Miss, try to understand and leave otherwise I’ll have to forcefully kick you out.
[01:43] Saifullah! Get her out of here.
[01:45] Miss, get up and leave.
[01:51] Come.
[02:16] You two must be really happy today, no?
[02:19] Seeing me cry over here like this.
[02:21] And you should be happy, Sitara. Your curse worked on Babar,
[02:25] I and our happiness.
[02:28] Sister in law, you’re thinking wrong.
[02:30] I can never wish badly upon my brother.
[02:33] You reap what you sow!
[02:36] So now you’re going to speak up too?
[02:38] You’ll tell me off, make fun of me!
[02:43] Alright.
[02:45] I’m a very bad person, right?
[02:47] My end should be bad too!
[02:51] I’m leaving from here! I’ll live in my house, alone.
[02:55] No matter what happens!
[02:57] What has happened, sister in law! Don’t take offence from what he said!
[03:00] What has happened, sister in law? Where are you going…
[03:02] What was the need for you to say all that! Now go and find her and also see where uncle is!
[03:05] Mom must be alone at the station!
[03:16] It’s a tea time.
[03:17] She must be bringing it!
[03:20] You? Wait!
[03:26] What are you doing here?
[03:28] And who brings just tea? Shameem!
[03:32] Shameem! Look and bring everything properly in a tray! You go away!
[03:36] You go back, maid!
[03:41] Come on, go!
[03:43] Come, let’s take a selfie for social media!
[03:46] It will be memorable!
[03:52] Wow! I’ll tag you. It’ll get famous!
[04:00] Shebi!
[04:02] You got her all the clothes, done with all the wedding shopping?
[04:09] Sana, I hope you liked your clothes…
[04:11] Of course, aunty!
[04:12] I love them all.
[04:16] Shahab has a wonderful taste.
[04:21] You wait. I’ll bring them and show you.
[04:24] Yes, yes of course!
[04:26] Alright so, I wanted to talk about the Mehr.
[04:31] Who is Mehar?
[04:34] Dower.
[04:35] Oh, dower! You may write as you wish!
[04:39] What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is mine.
[04:41] What’s Shebi’s is Sana’s and what’s Sana’s is Shebi’s!
[04:43] That means it’s ours only, right?
[04:56] Chanda! Wait
[04:58] Look,
[04:59] my wedding dress!
[05:01] You ran away and got married, right?
[05:06] You probably didn’t get the chance to become a bride.
[05:12] But won’t I look nice?
[05:22] Shahab will never marry you.
[05:30] Why don’t you just believe the fact that you’re just a maid over here?
[05:36] Because Shahab…
[05:37] Enough!
[05:39] Enough!
[05:41] I don’t want to hear Shahab’s name from your mouth ever again
[05:44] otherwise you’ll see what I do!
[05:48] And listen!
[05:49] Bring the rest of the things inside!
[06:04] Babar! Babar!
[06:09] Mom!
[06:12] Mom, what are you doing here?
[06:15] What happened? What did you do? What is all this?
[06:17] I have made a very big mistake!
[06:20] You were right when you told me I should control my anger.
[06:23] I am paying for my anger today!
[06:24] But what could I have done, mom?
[06:25] He was taking Erum with him, what could I have done?
[06:27] Your uncle is coming. We’ll find a solution for this.
[06:30] What’s going on? Get out of here! Come on, get out!
[06:34] On minute. What are you doing? We’re talking.
[06:37] Oh, you shut up! I don’t care if you’re talking!
[06:39] Talk with some respect, she’s my mother!
[06:40] I’ll talk to you with respect! Come on now! Get out of here!
[06:43] Keep the stick down! Keep the stick down!
[06:46] Shut up!
[06:47] Mom, you leave! There’s no need to deal with these ill-mannered people!
[06:50] You go. Quiet! Don’t make noise inside. Stay quiet!
[07:03] It must be mom!
[07:09] Sister in law! What happened? What did the police say?
[07:12] For god sake save my child, Murad!
[07:14] You don’t worry. I have contacts in the police.
[07:17] I will go and talk to him.
[07:18] You guys just do one thing and bring Erum back.
[07:22] It’s not safe for her to stay over there.
[07:25] Why, where did she go?
[07:26] She got upset and left!
[07:28] What? What happened? Why did she leave?
[07:30] Sister in law, this is not the time to argue. You just bring her back, I’ll go!
[07:34] Go! Go and find out!
[07:36] You sit down please! I’ll get water.
[07:47] Who is Babar out of you all?
[07:54] Come on, get up! Sir is calling you. You have gotten the bail!
[08:05] Erum,
[08:07] don’t be stubborn.
[08:09] They can come back anytime and harm you.
[08:13] You come with us!
[08:14] That’ll be good!
[08:16] They should just kill me once and for all!
[08:18] It’s better than living a suffocating life like this every day!
[08:21] Don’t say that.
[08:23] We’re already so tensed,
[08:25] you please don’t add to our worries.
[08:29] It’s not right for you to live alone over here.
[08:33] I apologize to you on mine and Zain’s behalf. Please, let it go
[08:39] and get going with us right now
[08:40] Didn’t I just say? I don’t want to go anywhere with you guys!
[08:45] Come out!
[08:46] You ruined our respect and put our brother in death’s face
[08:50] and you’re sitting over here?
[08:51] Come out otherwise we’ll come inside and kill you!
[08:58] Is that your cousin’s family?
[09:08] Seems like they have left.
[09:11] Listen to me!
[09:12] You won’t stay here at any cost now!
[09:14] I have heard enough from you.
[09:16] Now get up, pack your stuff and come with us!
[09:18] Yes, I’ll just help you pack. Let’s go from here!
[09:21] Come on, hurry up.
[10:40] What are you doing over here?
[10:42] Are you grieving?
[10:44] re you going to ruin my child’s happiness with your evil eyes?
[10:47] You remember how I locked you in the quarter, right? I’ll lock you again!
[10:51] Get up! And get out of here!
[10:53] ! I don’t want to see you here again, do you understand?
[11:10] My lovely wife! You... you sit together. Yes.
[11:19] Here you go.
[11:19] The rings are here!
[11:22] Take this, take this, Shebi! And my child, this is yours.
[11:55] Come on, Shebi. Go ahead.
[11:59] Shahab.
[12:08] Hold on!
[12:19] This engagement cannot happen!
[12:21] Stop this nonsense!
[12:23] I am your wife, you love me!
[12:26] How can you do this engagement, Shahab?
[12:30] And you guys!
[12:31] What show are you waiting for?
[12:33] What is happening over here?
[12:34] He’s my husband!
[12:39] How can you go ahead with this marriage?
[12:45] We promised to spend a lifetime with each other.
[12:48] We love each other.
[12:51] . I have apologized to you as well.
[12:54] Please!
[12:56] Please, Shahab!
[13:00] Throw away this ring. Don’t do this.
[13:02] Don’t do this to me! Please!
[13:20] You’re right.
[13:23] I love you.
[13:41] Shebi!
[13:55] Come on.
[13:57] Come on, son. Put it in her finger.
[14:06] You too!
[14:12] Happy birthday….
[14:14] Happy engagement!
[14:22] Let’s go for the dinner, inter-continental.
[16:01] Please, you tell me everything honestly. What is the actual matter?
[16:06] What should I tell you, Sitara?
[16:09] The FIR has been lodged.
[16:12] Babar is in a very big trouble, my child.
[16:16] The truth is that the entire game is of money.
[16:21] They have filed a complaint against him for attempt to murder.
[16:26] To be honest if they want, they can also get him murdered through target killing!
[16:33] You take me to the station.
[16:34] I’ll beg them, cry in their feet. I just want them to free my brother, that’s it!
[16:39] No, my child, no.
[16:41] The police doesn’t budge by begging.
[16:45] There must be some way!
[16:46] There’s only one way I can think of.
[16:52] And that way goes to Wajid Sahib.
[16:55] Look, my child. Wajid Sahib is a very understanding and calm man.
[17:00] I’m sure if sister in law talks to him herself, he will find a way out!
[17:36] Why have you brought me over here?
[17:39] To free you!
[17:40] To free me? But why over here? It’s so dark.
[17:46] Don’t argue much!
[17:48] What are you doing? Run from here! Run from here!
[17:56] Brother! Brother!
[17:59] What happened, Sitara?
[18:00] Mom! Save Bhai!
[18:02] Save Bhai! They are going to kill him! Please!
[18:05] Nothing is going to happen to your brother.
[18:06] I want to go him right now! I want to meet him right now!
[18:09] Take me to him! Take me to him!
[18:11] Zain, my child!
[18:12] Zain, open the door.
[18:13] I want to meet Bhai, please! They will kill him! They will kill him!
[18:19] Sister in law, is everything alright?
[18:22] Uncle!
[18:23] She saw a bad dream so she’s freaking out.
[18:25] Uncle, please bring Bhai back!
[18:27] Right now! Go to Wajid Sahib right now!
[18:29] Be strong, nothing’s going to happen! Babar is absolutely fine.
[18:35] Everything will be fine! Look, listen to me.
[18:39] You have faith in Allah, right? Keep your trust in Allah, everything will be fine!
[18:44] Sitara, my child. It’s gotten very late right now.
[18:46] I’ll take you to the police station tomorrow morning. Alright?
[18:49] You aren’t listening to me!
[18:52] My child, this is not the right time. It’s not appropriate to go over there at this hour.
[18:57] You go to Wajid Sahib right now.
[18:59] Ask him to please get my brother out of there!
[19:01] Please, go right now!
[19:02] Listen to me! I’ll go myself in the morning.
[19:05] You go!
[19:07] I’ll go! I’ll go with your uncle. Lay down.
[19:11] Take this, my child.
[19:12] You have seen a bad dream. Everything will be fine. Keep your trust in Allah.
[19:16] Sister in law, give her this water.
[19:22] Have water.
[19:27] In Sha Allah, everything will be fine. Go to sleep right now.
[19:31] Allah will make everything better.
[19:36] Yes. Alright, Murad. Alright.
[19:40] Everything will be fine.
[20:11] What are you two doing over here?
[20:14] This is not the right place. It doesn’t have nice people.
[20:17] You shouldn’t have brought Sitara over here.
[20:19] Who else would have come along with mom if not me?
[20:22] Who do we have other than you?
[20:26] You are our only support.
[20:31] Forgive me.
[20:35] All that is happening with me today is due to my ill behavior towards you.
[20:44] I should not have done that with you guys. I have hurt you guys a lot.
[20:47] Don’t say that.
[20:50] You can do anything, I won’t feel hurt.
[20:54] I just can’t see you in trouble.
[20:56] I have no complaints with you.
[21:00] How do you not have any complaints with me?
[21:02] I was your only support.
[21:07] You guys were my responsibility.
[21:10] I was blindfolded. I… I am very ashamed.
[21:14] Everything will be fine!
[21:16] Nothing will be fine.
[21:19] They are very scary people.
[21:22] They will get me hung at any cost.
[21:24] God forbid!
[21:26] Don’t say such things. You don’t have to lose hope.
[21:30] We are with you, right? We will get you out of here.
[21:33] You can’t do anything.
[21:36] I just have one request for you guys.
[21:41] No matter what happens to me, take care of Erum.
[21:47] She…
[21:51] she’s about to become a mother.
[21:54] What?
[22:00] Come on, miss. The meeting time is over. You guys can leave now.
[22:04] Yes, brother. We are just leaving. Please give this food to him.
[22:14] You keep this for you tea and biscuits.
[22:17] Alright, I’ll have to give you some time now.
[22:22] You can’t lose hope.
[22:26] Don’t worry.
[22:28] We are with you.
[22:32] We won’t let anything happen to you.
[23:10] Many congratulations.
[23:13] Take loads of care of yourself.
[23:16] You won’t feel troubled over here.
[23:18] Bhai will be back soon, In Sha Allah.
[23:21] In Sha Allah.
[23:25] Who are you calling?
[23:28] Hello? Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
[23:31] Please come back as soon as possible.
[23:33] Mom wants to go to Wajid Sahib’s house.
[23:36] Yes. Alright.
[23:38] Okay.
[23:43] You will have to go, mom.
[23:45] Yes, mom.
[23:47] You ask him to please help us.
[23:51] No matter how much it costs, we’ll return it all back to him.
[23:54] I’ll work myself!
[23:57] Mom, I’ll teach in a school. I’ll give tuitions too.
[24:01] We’ll pay back the entire loan. We just want Bhai to come back right now.
[24:13] Do you know?
[24:14] To tell you the truth, I did pity her a little
[24:17] but then I thought, after what she’s done with your child….
[24:21] I mean,
[24:22] how can a mother kill her own child?
[24:27] She should have taken care of herself.
[24:29] Yes. My child.
[24:35] How can a mother take away her child’s life?
[24:38] I know that she did all of this deliberately.
[24:41] I won’t spare her! I’ll take my revenge.
[24:47] She’ll go through the same pain I am going through today!
[24:55] Sana! Sana, forget everything.
[24:59] I really love you a lot.
[25:02] In fact, I have felt real love after meeting you!
[25:08] What is this behavior?
[25:10] And what are you doing with me?
[25:12] You used to have such romantic talks with me!
[25:14] And today, you’re saying the same things to someone else in front of me?
[25:17] What has happened to you! Respond to me!
[25:18] Because I’m sick of you!
[25:20] I’m tired!
[25:23] Don’t stand in front of me with all these questions
[25:26] because neither do I have the answers to your questions, nor can I give them!
[25:31] At least listen to me
[25:49] Alright, that’s nice.
[25:51] At least Tayi Jaan got a good news to hear.
[25:56] It’s just a few drops of rain that have fallen on a hot desert sand.
[26:03] Is everything alright, Sitara?
[26:06] Do you or anybody else have any difficulty?
[26:11] Uncle really takes care of us.
[26:13] Then why are you so sad? Why do you seem so tensed, Sitara?
[26:20] Bhai is in the lock up, Danish.
[26:22] What are you saying, Sitara?
[26:23] How? When? What did he do?
[26:26] Neither did dad inform me, nor did Tayi Jaan tell me anything.
[26:30] We are very worried, Danish.
[26:34] I don’t know why our destiny has so much pain written in it.
[26:39] I don’t know when all these worries are going to go away from our lives
[26:44] and when we will be in peace.
[26:47] It feels like our tears have dried out too now.
[26:54] Every day starts with a new difficulty,
[26:56] new tension and a new trial.
[27:00] You don’t worry, Sitara.
[27:01] I’ll talk to dad. He’ll get Babar Bhai out of there anyhow!
[27:06] Uncle is trying his best but I don’t know when Bhai is going to come.
[27:11] He will come, Sitara. Of course he will! You don’t worry
[27:16] Worried?
[27:18] You went to Dubai,
[27:21] Bhai is in the lockup, we’re going around here and there
[27:25] and you’re saying I shouldn’t be worried?
[27:28] Don’t say such disappointing things, Sitara.
[27:31] I don’t know what Allah Almighty wants from us, Danish.
[27:37] How much more helplessness is written in our destiny?
[27:41] Don’t say such things, Sitara. I’ll talk to dad. You be strong and have faith.
[27:46] I’ll call you again. Alright?
[27:51] Khuda Hafiz.
[28:12] Yes, he has beaten him. When did I deny from that?
[28:17] Don’t say that, Munir Sahib.
[28:19] There must be some way, some solution to get Babar out of there.
[28:26] Yes! This can be done.
[28:29] You mean, I should talk to them and let you know?
[28:33] Alright! Alright, I’ll get back to you.
[28:38] What was he saying, Wajid Sahib?
[28:40] He said that there can be two ways.
[28:45] One is through the court,
[28:48] where the cases go on for years but bail isn’t possible.
[28:53] God forbid that our Babar goes through that, Wajid Sahib.
[28:59] What’s the other way?
[29:02] The other way is that we get the matter resolved by paying some amount.
[29:10] How much?
[29:11] Around 45-50 lacs.
[29:19] 50 lacs?
[29:22] Wajid Sahib, this is a very big amount.
[29:27] I spoke to him right in front of you.
[29:31] My child is going to die like that!
[29:33] This is very unfair.
[29:36] Wajid Sahib, I know that you can do a lot if you try.
[29:47] You are our only support right now.
[29:51] You will have to do something.
[29:54] Alright, I’ll find a way out. Don’t worry.
[29:57] The minimum I can do is request them to not raise their hand on him.
[30:01] And anyway, there’s a strike at the court tomorrow so the session won’t take place either.
[30:06] We will have to do something before taking him to the court day after tomorrow.
[30:10] Alright, Wajid Sahib.
[30:13] I’ll... arrange some amount of money.
[30:29] Aapi! Have you made this for me?
[30:32] Move! This for sister in law.
[30:34] Why are you always making everything for her?
[30:36] She still isn’t normal with us.
[30:38] Why are you and mom spoiling her by taking care of her?
[30:41] You’re a kid, right? Then talk like kids do!
[30:45] Alright, listen.
[30:47] When is the baby coming?
[30:49] What did I just say to you? Talk like kids!
[30:52] ! I don’t have an answer to every question of yours!
[31:01] Where’s the ring?
[31:04] Chanda! Chanda!
[31:10] Yes?
[31:13] Where is this set’s ring?
[31:16] I don’t know. I gave all the sets and everything to you.
[31:20] But the ring isn’t there, right? Where is its ring?
[31:23] I don’t know.
[31:24] What do you mean you don’t know? Did you give it to your family? Tell me! Speak!
[31:27] I didn’t give anything to anyone…
[31:48] You got saved.
[31:50] Go!
[31:56] Hello?
[31:58] Yes, brother!
[32:00] I am just on my way to your shop.
[32:02] Actually, my son is getting married so I have to get some jewelry made for my daughter in law.
[32:10] That marriage ended!
[32:15] My poor son was stuck.
[32:20] , yes. You just take all the new and nice designs out.
[32:23] I don’t want any from the ancient times!
[32:27] Alright then. I’ll see when I come.
[32:32] Mom, please.
[32:37] Sister in law, what I’m about to say is something that my heart doesn’t agree on
[32:43] and neither do I know how to say it.
[32:51] What happened, uncle? What is it?
[32:55] My child, we just have one way left to save Babar.
[33:04] What is that, uncle?
[33:08] My child, the amount of money that we need for Babar’s bail
[33:15] cannot be arranged by Danish or me.
[33:19] There’s no need to tell Danish anything!
[33:21] Sister in law, I wanted the same.
[33:24] He’s abroad, he’ll get worried for no reason but she’s a child, she called him out of worry.
[33:32] What was the need to tell him?
[33:34] Everyone has made me sick!
[33:36] I don’t know how to get rid of this problem!
[33:43] Sister in law, you sell your house.
[33:52] We don’t have any other way now.
[33:58] Look, this house of bricks and stones isn’t more precious than our children’s lives, right?
[34:05] Sister in law, god forbid if something happens to Babar then…
[34:10] I just want my son back!
[34:13] Why didn’t I think of this before?
[34:17] There’s just one day left now.
[34:21] You’ll have to do something soon!
[34:22] Yes, yes. I will try my best to get this done by tomorrow.
[34:28] Sister in law, the house documents…
[34:33] They’re kept in the locker at home. Erum gave me the key.
[34:36] I am just worried about how hurt the children will be when they find out about this.
[34:44] Their father built this house for them with so much love…
[34:48] Don’t tell anyone anything right now
[34:52] You’re absolutely right. This is what we should do!
[34:55] I’ll bring the key. You just go and get the papers. Do something today only!
[34:59] In Sha Allah, I’ll talk to Wajid Sahib right now only.
[35:13] Congratulations, Murad!
[35:16] You’ve done it.
[35:19] I’ll talk to Wajid Sahib right now.
[35:24] Yes of course. I’ll be there in half an hour, okay? Bye!
[35:27] Oh! You know what aunty says is right! You have a very unpleasant face.
[35:33] The entire day goes bad once we’ve seen your face, I swear!
[35:40] Actually, this happens to people who are doing me wrong!
[35:45] They get scared from the inside,
[35:46] they get worried thinking about how Allah is going to punish them!
[35:54] Like you!
[35:55] You are so scared of me!
[35:58] Did you forget?
[35:59] Shahab refused to you for marriage
[36:01] because he loves me!
[36:04] But you couldn’t bear with that and you left the country.
[36:12] Get ready,
[36:14] book a flight too if you can.
[36:18] Who knows?
[36:19] You might have to leave tomorrow night only.
[36:24] Move away!
[36:26] What?
[36:29] I have to clean the dirt!
[36:30] Oh just shut up!
