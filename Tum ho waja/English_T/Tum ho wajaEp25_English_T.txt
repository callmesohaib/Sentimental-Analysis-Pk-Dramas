[00:31] I want to go! That’s it!
[00:32] You can’t go!
[00:33] Why can’t I go! If it was your dad’s funeral instead of mine, what would you have done?
[00:38] Stop talking nonsense!
[00:56] Come upstairs! Come! Come!
[01:05] He slapped her quite hard, didn’t he? Let’s have tea on this happy occasion then.
[01:23] You are still safe Muraad but think about the day when Babar will get to know the truth,
[01:31] he will want to kill you. You’ll have to do something..
[01:46] Babar,
[01:49] come on son get up.
[02:02] Be strong.. Be strong okay? Be strong.
[02:10] Let’s go.
[02:21] Muraad..
[02:25] It’s all your fault brother,
[02:28] if only you hadn’t slapped me then all of this wouldn’t have happened.
[02:34] Mom, mom wake up. Mom please..
[02:36] Mom please wake up. Mom, wake up. Mom, look
[02:40] we just came back from burying dad. Mom wake up.. Mom..
[02:55] What If mom also just like dad..
[02:58] No.. Nothing of that sort will happen.
[03:00] What happened?
[03:04] Brother, take a look at home. She’s not waking up. Please wake mom up, please..
[03:10] Nothing has happened, she’s sleeping. She’s resting..
[03:13] Brother please.. please wake mom up..
[03:15] What’s wrong Zain? What’s wrong my child? Nothing has happened to mom,
[03:19] she’s just sleeping. I am telling you, listen to me..
[03:38] Chanda..
[03:40] Don’t touch me. Stay away from me..
[03:44] Chanda..
[03:44] Do you not understand? Stay away.. stay away from me..
[03:50] What’s wrong with you?
[03:55] What’s wrong?
[03:59] You’re still asking me what’s wrong..
[04:03] My father died.. My father went away from this world! And you didn’t let me go and see his face!
[04:13] You are a selfish and apathetic person.
[04:18] You have no sympathy with me.. You have no humanity in you!
[04:25] And downstairs, and what about the nonsense you spoke downstairs?
[04:28] Yes I did talk nonsense,
[04:31] I defiantly talked nonsense and there was a reason behind that nonsense.
[04:37] Okay now forget what happened Chanda. Please..
[04:41] I should forget? All hell has broken loose and you’re asking me to forget everything?
[04:49] My father left this world and you didn’t even let me see his face!
[04:55] And you’re asking me to forget about it! How do I forget?
[05:01] You slapped me right? You raised your hand on me. Is that your humanity?
[05:08] Instead of taking me to my father you slapped me.
[05:11] Did you not understand what mama said downstairs?
[05:14] I understood you, your mother and your father but you’re not understanding!
[05:24] I didn’t marry you for this.
[05:28] Did we get married for this? We loved each other, right?
[05:33] Loving me is another story, you don’t even have any humanity in you,
[05:38] you didn’t even let me see my father’s face!
[05:46] My father is gone.. he’s gone..
[05:56] Dad! Dad.. Don’t touch me!
[06:00] Chanda..
[06:17] How is the situation upstairs?
[06:21] I don’t know.
[06:23] I didn’t have it in me to go near their room.
[06:26] Why?
[06:28] What do you think? Will that girl stay quiet after what all that happened?
[06:33] And if had gone in the room and if she would have misbehaved with Shebi in front of me
[06:37] then the situation would have gotten worse.
[06:45] Listen to me carefully,
[06:55] the slap she got from Shebi, it didn’t affect her cheek, it affected her heart, directly her heart.
[07:05] Now slowly and gradually both of them will start disliking each other,
[07:10] disagreements will start taking place.
[07:14] The day Shebi gives up, that day will be the last day of that girl in this house and in Shebi’s life.
[07:33] But I never hit you, you never gave me the chance.
[07:51] For now sister in law is unconscious,
[07:55] I don’t know what she will do when she’ll gain consciousness.
[08:00] Dad, you look worried..
[08:03] Come.. come..
[08:03] What’s wrong with you? Are you in your senses?
[08:06] Keep it here then you can go outside.
[08:08] Mr. Wajid what was the need for bringing all this?
[08:11] It’s not about need, it’s about humanity.
[08:15] When people lose their loved ones they don’t even have any clue about themselves.
[08:19] Who will cook at home?
[08:21] Then in such times it’s the responsibility of people like us to take care of them
[08:25] who we’re related to.
[08:27] Yes.
[08:33] Mama!
[08:36] Mama!
[08:38] What’s wrong Shebi? Why are you shouting? What’s the problem?
[08:42] What do I do? I don’t understand anything. Go look at her condition, she’s in so much pain.
[08:48] Then tell us, what have we done? Is it our fault?
[08:53] No. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s all my fault!
[08:57] One minute! What’s the point of talking like this?
[09:02] What are you two arguing about? I’ll go check on her.
[09:06] No, there is no need. She’s already very angry.
[09:10] Then what are you saying? Should we leave her alone?
[09:14] I think that would be better.
[09:16] How is that better?
[09:18] How can we leave her alone in this condition? What if her BP rises or decreases?
[09:23] Son, she needs to rest right now. I think we should give her a sleeping pill..
[09:35] What do you mean a sleeping pill?
[09:38] Your mother is right. She’s in shock right now so if she’ll take a relaxant then she’ll feel better.
[09:45] Yes son, don’t worry.
[09:49] Nothing is going to happen to her. I’ll go bring it, I’ll handle everything. You don’t worry.
[10:02] What’s wrong?
[10:04] You should be strong Shebi. What’s wrong..
[10:06] Your mother will take care of it, don’t worry. She’ll handle it.
[10:20] I have never seen such a exquisite man in my life.
[10:25] I lost an honest friend.
[10:29] He used to always be concerned about his children,
[10:31] he used to take promises from me on various occasions saying
[10:33] that if anything happens to me Wajid, then take care of my children.
[10:43] Now is the time to fulfill that promise. Look son, don’t ever think of me as a stranger okay?
[10:53] Do let me know if anything small or big happens or if there’s some kind of problem at home.
[11:01] I’ll try my best to take of you all. Okay?
[11:07] Thank you so much.
[11:09] What’s there to be thankful for?
[11:13] This house is like my second home now, I’ll be coming and going.
[11:18] Of course.
[11:43] How is aunty feeling now?
[11:51] You should leave right away.
[11:54] You shouldn’t be concerned about my mother’s health. Just leave right now.
[11:59] What’s wrong Sitara? Why are you speaking to me like that?
[12:05] Be thankful that I’m only talking, technically I should be kicking you out of here.
[12:13] Sitara, what has happened to you?
[12:17] What has happened to me?
[12:21] Do you not remember anything?
[12:23] You don’t see anything? Such an apathetical behavior?
[12:25] Why are you showing such an apothecial behavior?
[12:30] Sitara please talk clearly..
[12:33] Do you have the courage to listen?
[12:35] You are the only reason behind this situation of ours. All this has happened because of you.
[12:44] All this has happened because of me?
[12:48] Yes.. Why did you leave me those messages when I had already refused to you!
[12:51] If you hadn’t sent me those messages, dad would’ve never seen them.
[12:55] He would’ve never gotten furious, and his health would have never been affected.
[12:58] And he wouldn’t have left us!
[13:00] He would have been with us now..
[13:03] Why did you send me those messages?
[13:06] What was the need for it when I had refused to you? Why..
[13:11] Sitara, what are you saying?
[13:15] I have never felt this way.
[13:18] I have never thought about it then why did you think that I love you?
[13:23] Why?
[13:27] Why..
[13:30] I can never forgive myself.
[13:33] I’ve started hating myself.. All this has happened because of me..
[13:45] But remember one thing, I won’t forgive myself but I will also never forgive you. Never..
[13:54] All the respect I had for you has finished.
[13:59] You are still standing here.. why aren’t you leaving? What more do you want? Just go..
[14:22] Dad..
[14:27] Dad is gone..
[14:32] I will also die..
[14:37] I want to go to dad Shahab..
[14:41] Mom, what is she saying?
[14:45] Why isn’t she waking up? What kind of things is she saying? Please tell me..
[14:49] Shebi, let her sleep.
[14:52] The more she sleeps the sooner she will get better. You come with, eat something.
[15:00] You go on, I’m coming.
[15:33] Sit down, sit.
[15:38] Look Shebi, you are our son, our only son.
[15:45] You are everything to us wife and husband.
[15:50] My generation will move forward from your son right?
[15:56] Yes, I know.
[16:02] You are worried because of Chanda right?
[16:05] We are also very worried.
[16:12] We did everything, we didn’t keep any grudges.. We are only living because of you.
[16:21] Yes.
[16:25] Look, the point of speaking on this topic was that
[16:34] if me and your mother will think of Chanda and your child then
[16:42] that will only be for their betterment Shebi..
[16:50] I have hurt you and mama a lot..
[16:54] No no, you shouldn’t think like that. Why are you saying such a thing?
[17:05] I was very angry.
[17:10] I was very angry. I was stern on the fact
[17:19] that he should come and apologize, it was my right.
[17:24] The poor guy died.. God forgive me, may he give him heaven’s dew.
[17:33] Amen. Actually dad, she used to love her dad a lot.
[17:40] Yes, I know. I know..
[17:47] My heart melted..
[17:49] Keeping the rules aside I thought of taking her to her father’s funeral but then
[17:56] Shebi it occurred to me that what if it affects your child to be somehow..
[18:04] Look, you have to take good care of Chanda, be strong, with a lot of love.
[18:14] Yes I know. She’ll start insisting again on going when she’ll wake up..
[18:22] He’s gone now, he has died who she wanted to meet. What’s the point of meeting anyone now?
[18:29] I have forgiven the person who has died but not anyone else.
[18:37] Look Shebi, do remember your promise, no one will go from this house to theirs
[18:44] nor will anyone come from their house to ours.
[18:50] Go and check if she has woken up. Go and check son.
[19:16] You saw my house’s weak walls and tried to damage them too, right?
[19:30] Why did you leave me those messages when I had already refused to you!
[19:32] If you hadn’t sent me those messages, dad would’ve never seen them.
[19:36] He would’ve never gotten furious, and his health would have never been affected.
[19:40] And he wouldn’t have left us!
[19:43] Get out! Get out! I say get out of my house!
[19:46] But, uncle….
[19:46] Get out!
[19:50] Uncle, please forgive me.
[19:56] Mom!
[19:57] Mom, wake up! Mom, please wake up.
[20:01] Bhai, why isn’t mom waking up!
[20:04] Actually, the doctor has given her sleeping pills. That’s why she’s waking up.
[20:10] Bhai, mom won’t leave us like dad did, right?
[20:16] No, no, Zain. Why are you saying that?
[20:20] Nothing like that will happen to mom. She will be fine.
[20:22] Mom, wake up. Mom, wake up. Please, wake up.
[20:34] Dad isn’t here anymore, mom. He isn’t here.
[20:40] Forgive me, Mansoor.
[20:46] Forgive me.
[20:52] Bhai had a very big fight with sister in law before he passed away. He felt pain, he fell!
[21:00] I wish Chanda hadn’t done all of this and your dad would’ve been alive!
[21:13] Tell me the truth, uncle.
[21:15] What had happened?
[21:20] What truth do I tell you?
[21:26] On dad’s funeral, you were saying that mom and dad had a fight, right? What was it about?
[21:35] Really? Was I saying that? I don’t remember anything.
[21:45] It is very evident that you’re hiding something.
[21:49] No, Babar, my son. Why would I hide anything?
[21:56] Son, the one who had to leave has left. Forget these things.
[22:00] The one who left was my father!
[22:03] This is your chance, Muraad.
[22:06] Take Babar into confidence and put the entire blame on sister in law or you lose your life.
[22:14] Tell me, uncle! What are you thinking!
[22:16] Babar, my son.
[22:19] You won’t be able to hear it.
[22:24] And if you hear it, you won’t believe it.
[22:32] But if you insist, then gather the courage and hear me out.
[22:43] Son, when I came to your house, Bhai Sahib and sister in law were fighting…. because of Chanda.
[22:56] Sister in law was very furious. Bhai Sahib was saying to sister in law….
[23:05] Not saying but begging that she shouldn’t meet Chanda at any cost.
[23:16] So that whatever little is left of his pride, remains.
[23:21] But sister in law!
[23:24] Sister in law was saying that she would bring Chanda back home no matter what.
[23:34] And son, Shebi’s parents wanted Bhai Sahib to beg in front of them and apologize.
[23:52] And sister in law was yelling and screaming and forcing Bhai Sahib to do so.
[24:01] And that’s it. My Bhai and my dad couldn’t bare this insult and he left me!
[24:20] And Babar,
[24:26] as far as I am concerned….
[24:34] I was helpless.
[24:43] Sister in law had made me helpless about keeping Chanda at my house at any cost.
[24:54] Babar, son. Your uncle was helpless!
[25:11] These words of yours, these lies are hurting me. I keep breaking from the inside!
[25:17] Don’t take any such step that leads me to my grave!
[25:21] Her education, her going out is all over!
[25:23] At least you take care of your health….
[25:24] To hell with my health! Pray that Mansoor dies!
[25:26] Didn’t I tell you that Chanda was dead for us!
[25:29] Pull yourself together! Mansoor!
[25:35] Pull yourself together! Mansoor!
[25:40] You used to say that he was like a father to you.
[25:44] Didn’t you feel any shame before raising your hand on your brother?
[25:48] Excuse me.
[25:49] Doctor, dad is fine. Right?
[25:50] Sorry.
[25:52] Mom, dad is no more! Dad is dead!
[26:14] Mansoor! Mansoor!
[26:29] Mansoor! Why isn’t he back yet? Where has he gone? Mansoor.
[26:33] Mom! What has happened to you? Where are you going!
[26:36] Mansoor…
[26:36] Come back to your senses. Come here. Stop it!
[26:40] Shameless! Shameless human!
[26:43] What happened!
[26:43] You!
[26:45] You raised your hand on your brother!
[26:47] Mom, what has happened to you? Come back to your senses!
[26:49] What are you saying, sister in law!
[26:52] You slapped him and he couldn’t hold himself together!
[26:55] Sister in law, he was raising his hand on you! All I did was save you!
[26:59] Liar! Cheap man!
[27:01] He wasn’t slapping me but you. And you slapped him back in response!
[27:04] You took his life away!
[27:06] Mom! Come to your senses!
[27:07] I won’t spare you!
[27:08] What are you saying, sister in law?
[27:10] If you think that my hands have committed this crime.
[27:14] If you think that I raised these hands on my father like brother then Babar….
[27:17] I don’t want these hands!
[27:18] I will cut these hands!
[27:20] What are you doing! You’re not in your senses right now!
[27:22] No! Don’t you see that? What is your mom saying!
[27:27] Look, your uncle can die but he can never raise his hand on his brother!
[27:32] I know that…
[27:32] Get out! Get out and go die somewhere!
[27:35] How can I be alive after you’ve put such a big blame on me! I won’t live! I am going from here!
[27:41] Uncle, listen to me….
[27:42] Put such a big blame on me!
[27:43] Uncle!
[27:44] Can I kill my brother, after all!
[27:45] Uncle!
[27:46] Move away!
[27:47] Uncle, listen to me…
[27:47] I say move away! Let me die! Didn’t you hear all what sister in law said about me?
[27:54] Uncle, you let it go! Let it go!
[27:56] What must you be thinking! What must you be thinking about your uncle after hearing all this?
[28:01] I am not thinking anything, uncle!
[28:03] You also try understanding that she isn’t in the right state of mind right now!
[28:07] What you’re saying is absolutely right, Babar!
[28:10] I think that sister in law has made such a big mistake which cannot be undone
[28:15] and that has affected her mental health.
[28:18] Didn’t you see? The way she screamed at me when she came outside!
[28:22] She said so much. So much about me! About me!
[28:25] You let it go. Leave it…
[28:26] How should I let it go? She’s my sister in law, equivalent to my mother!
[28:33] I am the one who lost his brother! That too, forever!
[28:36] This heart is exploding with pain!
[28:39] But it’s my helplessness that I can’t leave my sister in law in this condition!
[28:44] Uncle, you take care of yourself. I’ll handle her.
[28:47] Yes, Babar! You’re absolutely right.
[28:51] Your mother needs you the most right now. Go, son! Take care of your mother!
[28:53] And look, Babar.  Son, the one who had to leave has left. We cannot bring Bhai Sahib back now.
[29:01] But we have to take care of sister in law.
[29:03] Uncle, all of that is fine but you….
[29:05] Son, don’t worry about me.
[29:08] Your uncle is completely fine. You just take care of your mother! Go!
[29:12] And listen! If she says anything, you stay quiet!
[29:32] I will have to make this little snake dance around my fingers.
[29:40] The way she was saying you raised his hands on him. You took his life away!
[29:50] She’s going to put the blame on me? I will deal with you, sister in law!
[29:59] Your aunt has gone crazy. Completely crazy!
[30:02] What are you saying, dad?
[30:03] What I’m saying is right. Bhai Sahib’s demise has made her crazy, Danish. Crazy!
[30:11] No, dad. At least tell me, what did aunt say?
[30:15] Do you know?
[30:17] Your aunt came out of the room all of a sudden.
[30:21] She saw all of us and started yelling and screaming. She started hitting us!
[30:26] She put the blame on us.
[30:29] She said that all of us have killed Bhai Sahib together! That we killed Mansoor! All of us!
[30:37] So then Babar, Zain and Sitara must be very disturbed!
[30:41] You shouldn’t have left them in such circumstances, dad.
[30:45] Danish, do you know what happened over there? Your aunt pushed me out of the house!
[30:54] What? What are you saying, dad? How is that possible?
[30:58] I am telling you the truth, Danish. I couldn’t believe it either at first.
[31:04] Although, I wanted to stay with my children.
[31:09] Danish, it was my duty to stay with my children until they get better!
[31:15] Oh Allah!
[31:17] Oh Allah! Give my sister in law the strength to bear with this loss so she stays with her children.
[31:26] It will take time, dad.
[31:28] It will take time for her to be okay. Uncle’s sudden demise has shaken everybody.
[31:36] Son,
[31:39] I didn’t even have anyone else other than my brother.
[31:45] Your father only had one brother. I don’t even have anything else!
[31:52] Pull yourself together, dad. Pull yourself together.
[31:55] You are the head of this house now.
[31:57] And how will everything move around if this is how you deal with it?
[32:01] I’ll do one thing. I’ll go and take care of everything.
[32:05] No! No, Danish, no!
[32:08] You won’t go over there right now.
[32:11] So then will Sitara and Zain look after aunty all by themselves?
[32:14] The condition that they are in right now, how is Babar going to do everything alone?
[32:19] You know that my son, Babar?
[32:22] Allah has given him a lot of strength.
[32:26] The way he was handling his mother, giving her a shoulder. I could see my brother in Babar.
[32:36] He told me I shouldn’t worry and let his mother be and that he will take care of everything.
[33:09] Bhai Sahib was begging that she shouldn’t meet Chanda at any cost.
[33:18] Sister in law was saying that she would bring Chanda back home no matter what.
[33:30] I… I had to be buried by his hands but he has left me all by myself! He left me all alone,
[33:43] Babar! What will I do my entire life?
[33:49] I wasn’t in my senses.
[33:54] My mind had gone numb.
[34:08] I couldn’t even see his face for the last time.
[34:20] He has left me!
[34:31] I couldn’t see his face! How unfortunate am I!
[34:43] You aren’t the one who is unfortunate. It was dad.
[34:53] The person he loved all his life,
[35:02] took his life away.
[35:07] You are the reason for his death. You!
[35:51] Danish!
[35:55] Danish!
[36:03] Sister in law, you?
[36:08] Come. Sit.
[36:12] Cowardly, cheap person!
[36:16] My house got destroyed because of you. Everything is finished!
[36:20] Sister in law, what are you saying?
[36:23] I won’t leave you.
[36:24] I didn’t do anything like that…. Sister in law!
[36:27] I will kill you.
[36:28] Sister in law, keep this down! Sister in law! Sister in law!
[36:31] Go to hell!
