[00:30] Should I cut more?
[00:31] Zain! Go and rest in your room.
[00:35] Listen! Take these. And have all of the apples.
[00:44] Who were you speaking to on the phone last night?
[00:48] Me?
[00:51] Umm... no one?
[00:57] Who is Shahab?
[01:04] He’s..
[01:08] my friend.
[01:15] We both like each other and we want to get married.
[01:20] What?
[01:27] Yes.
[01:40] Oh god mama,
[01:42] I’ve told you guys so many times where they live, what they do.
[01:47] I don’t know anything except the fact
[01:48] that you two are going to Chanda’s house for my marriage proposal and that’s it.
[01:50] How can we go to someone’s house uninvited?
[02:00] Wow Sebi,
[02:02] you made things easy for us
[02:06] We will go to see our daughter in law
[02:11] Really dad?
[02:12] Umhm.
[02:13] Oh wow.
[02:16] You my problem so easy.
[02:19] Mama, Chanda is a nice girl, you’ll like her.
[02:34] What were thinking when you said that?
[02:37] I am telling you, I won’t get my only son married to some ordinary girl.
[02:43] Why do you worry?
[02:46] My only son likes some girl so we must go and see her. We’ll go today in fact right now.
[02:54] You go and get ready quickly.
[03:00] Get ready..
[03:33] Hello yes, have mom and dad reached?
[03:35] Yes, they’re here.
[03:38] They’re sitting in the drawing room.
[03:42] Now look, I have done my part, you have to do yours now,
[03:47] tell your mom and dad to fix the wedding date as soon as possible.
[03:51] You don’t worry. I’ll to mom as soon as they leave.
[03:56] Alright. I’ll wait for your call.
[03:59] Khuda hafiz.
[04:00] Okay, bye.
[04:18] Chanda is just coming.
[04:21] If you guys would have told us before coming then I would’ve asked her father..
[04:38] We don’t need to call or anything or meet Chanda’s father.
[04:48] My name is Ghafoor Counselor, I’m quite a twisted man.
[04:52] I only came to this odd house under my sons insistence.
[04:59] Oh yes and call, you’ll be the one calling my wife tomorrow
[05:06] and you’ll refuse to this proposal, you.
[05:12] And the children shouldn’t find out that we’re the ones who have asked you to refuse.
[05:22] But sister..
[05:23] No!
[05:25] You and her are not equals, no need to make sister relations.
[06:08] You’ve spoiled your daughter quiet a lot.
[06:12] She roams around with my son on the streets, shameless!
[06:20] What kind of a woman, what kind of a mother are you?
[06:33] You’ve spoiled your daughter quiet a lot
[06:36] She roams around with my son on the streets,
[06:40] what kind of a mother are you?
[06:47] You spoke nonsense about me to mom right?
[06:49] That I talk to Shahab on the phone all night.
[06:53] Why would I tell her sister ?
[06:55] Our mom is smart,
[06:57] even if we don’t tell her anything she understands everything herself.
[07:01] We are not her mother, she is our mother.
[07:04] Don’t try to act like my grandmother.
[07:06] Mom’s telltale! So called favorite.
[07:08] Then you become the favorite, I didn’t stop you.
[07:13] No no, I don’t need to become one. You are one, that’s enough.
[07:19] Did you see, Shahab sent his parents for marriage.
[07:23] What were you guys thinking, that me and Shahabs relationship is ordinary?
[07:27] No way. We are very special to each other.
[07:33] You’ll see, Shahabs mother will hug with so much love that our mother will be shocked.
[07:40] You were coming to call me right?
[07:41] Take a look, I look nice right? Shall we go.
[07:44] Chanda..
[07:45] Yes?
[07:46] They’ve left.
[07:51] They left..
[07:54] how can they leave like that?
[07:56] I wanted to meet them.
[07:57] They can’t leave without meeting me mom. What are you saying? I’ll go check.
[08:02] They got a call. Maybe they had to be somewhere, that’s why they left.
[08:08] They got a call? It had only been a little while since they had come.
[08:11] They didn’t even see me and they left. I was just about to come.
[08:20] Mom..
[08:24] I hope you didn’t screw up..
[08:31] What do you mean?
[08:32] They were our guests, why would I screw up?
[08:36] I told you they had some important work..
[08:41] They had something important to do so they left..
[08:44] So that’s okay.
[08:46] They had something important to do.
[08:47] They came for a marriage proposal so that’s fine. Mom talk to dad soon and say yes.
[09:08] How can they leave without meeting me?
[09:15] What if mom screwed up..
[09:18] What’s wrong with you sister? Why do you think like that?
[09:26] I think there’s something fishy from their side..
[09:29] You be quiet!
[09:31] There can’t be any problem from there In fact I sense something fishy going on from here.
[09:50] They were such weird people.
[09:53] God knows where Chanda has trapped herself.
[09:56] Where has she been meeting that boy? Who is he?
[10:03] They asked me to refuse,
[10:06] she’s asking me to say yes soon.
[10:09] Oh god, I can’t do anything. Mansoor will talk to Chanda now.
[10:17] Chanda is his pride,
[10:21] if he’ll find out all of this then he’ll be very upset.
[10:27] I’ll have to handle this matter myself somehow
[10:33] I can’t tell Mansoor.
[11:01] So? You two went, how was it? How did you find Chanda?
[11:07] Nice, nice, very nice.
[11:11] Yes, I also had plans that I would make my daughter in law wear
[11:16] my heirlooms when I see her for the first time but
[11:21] we didn’t get to meet her..
[11:23] Come on stop it.
[11:24] What’s the big deal?
[11:26] Why do we need to meet her when our son has picked the girl then that’s done.
[11:31] No.. what..
[11:32] Hold on.
[11:33] And the bangles you want to make her wear,
[11:35] you can give them to her as how many as you like after marriage when she comes.
[11:38] No no, what do you mean dad?
[11:39] You guys went and you didn’t meet Chanda?
[11:42] Yes, actually her mother had some important work and her father was also not home..
[11:50] Then you guys should have gone in the evening when everybody would have been home.
[11:54] Yes, he’s right
[11:56] But we’ll keep meeting each other now, we’ll sit across each other and chat.
[12:01] You guys could’ve gone,
[12:02] met everyone, things would’ve gotten official so I would’ve also been relieved.
[12:07] Son, I also had the same wish.
[12:12] We’ll go again tomorrow then. We’ll go tomorrow, your wish will come true.
[12:17] I haven’t eaten anything since morning,
[12:19] they also didn’t offer anything anyways you go get me something to eat.
[12:23] Alright, I’ll go.
[12:23] Father and son should also have a conversation.
[12:30] I sent your mother because you know how women are.
[12:33] Their house was ordinary, sort of old..
[12:36] we didn’t even eat anything there, let that be.. that shouldn’t be discussed.
[12:39] I’ll tell you something, you know your… what’s his name Ikram uncle.
[12:44] It occurred to me from your wish, he used to recite a poetry saying..
[12:48] I have a thousand girls, each one afflicts me so.
[12:53] But although who afflicts me the most does not leave her house enough.
[12:58] I hadn’t even seen your mother before marriage, you are quite lucky.
[13:02] It’s okay, don’t worry. We’ll have a lot of meetings.
[13:16] Yes miss Chanda, are you at peace now?
[13:19] Mama and papa came to your house.
[13:22] Yes but aunty and uncle left so early.
[13:26] I really wanted to sit with them and talk.
[13:29] I didn’t get a chance. They left even before I could come.
[13:33] Yes, dad was saying your mama had to go somewhere..
[13:37] My mom had to go somewhere?
[13:38] Yes, according to dad.
[13:44] Okay.
[13:53] Yes, there was some death in the neighborhood. She had to go to the funeral.
[14:00] Oh okay. And your father was also not home..
[14:08] I’ll call you later okay?
[14:09] Hello Chanda? Listen to me at least..
[14:13] Yes?
[14:14] Tell me, when are we meeting?
[14:18] I’ll tell you. I’ll call you back and tell you.
[14:20] Chanda..
[14:27] Mom, you know that I don’t eat the roti we get from outside.
[14:30] You bring it, I’ll make two for you at home.
[14:33] At least tell me how many should I bring? Should I bring five?
[14:36] Yes.
[14:41] What did you say to her?
[14:43] To who?
[14:44] To Shahabs parents.
[14:47] I said nothing.
[14:48] Shahab called me just now,
[14:51] you told them you had to go somewhere
[14:54] and you told me that Shahab’s parents had to go somewhere that is why they left early.
[14:58] Come, come on in. Come come.
[15:04] Asalam o alikum!
[15:05] Asalam o alikum. How are you?
[15:07] I’m fine.
[15:09] Mashallah, my heart prays for you whenever I see you with your children.
[15:14] You stay busy with your children all the time.
[15:16] May god keeps you happy and fulfilled.
[15:18] Amen.
[15:19] I can’t seem to see other children around.
[15:21] Our older one I think is still not home.
[15:25] The younger just stepped out
[15:26] and I think Sitara must be there. Sitara! Here she is..
[15:29] Asalam o alikum uncle.
[15:30] Walikum Salam. How are you?
[15:32] I’m fine.
[15:33] Mashallah. How are your studies going?
[15:36] They’re going good.
[15:38] What are you planning to become in the future?
[15:41] Architect engineer.
[15:42] Oh wow
[15:44] Mansoor I think she’s going to be taking care of our construction company in the future.
[15:49] The children have big dreams and parents only wish to see them respectfully married one day.
[15:56] Amen.
[15:57] Take a seat brother. Go make tea Sitara..
[16:01] Take a seat..
[16:01] Please sit, I’ll be back..
[16:05] Master sahib, you have to tell honestly whatever mistake there is..
[16:09] But the stitching is absolutely fine
[16:11] But there’s still some work left to do..
[16:32] What is it? What’s worrying you which has made you sit so quietly.
[16:39] What do I tell you?
[16:41] Whatever that is bothering you. I’ll try to resolve it.
[16:49] We have young girls in our house, why do you keep bringing Mr. Wajid home?
[16:55] He’s a decent man
[16:59] And it’s destiny that
[17:01] his wife has gotten upset and is in London with the children, he’s all alone here.
[17:06] He comes for a little while so he becomes happy among the children. What else..
[17:10] Still Mansoor..
[17:13] I’m the guardian of this house so I know who to bring him and who not to.
[17:21] Trust me.
[17:29] I made a mistake. I made a huge mistake.
[17:32] I should’ve called them when dad was home. Mom screwed up everything.
[17:39] Sister?
[17:40] What is it? Say it.
[17:44] I’ll tell you when you’ll stop pacing.
[17:46] I stopped. Tell me, what is it?
[17:48] Help with my homework.
[17:51] Zain go away right now! I can’t help you with your homework!
[17:54] Please sister?
[17:55] I asked you leave! Why are you annoying me?
[17:58] There’s only one math exercise, only one.
[18:00] Don’t make me lose it! I’ll give you slap! Go!
[18:05] what happened?
[18:06] There’s only one math exercise I need help with, she’s not even helping me with that.
[18:12] You should have asked me, I would’ve helped you.
[18:19] He’s asking me help with the exercise.
[18:20] I’m stuck here with my problems and he wants help with the exercise.
[18:25] What do I do..
[18:37] Give me your mobile.
[18:38] What? Go away.
[18:40] Give me your mobile.
[18:42] What nonsense. Shut up! Give me my keys.
[18:46] Look at this!
[18:47] I say you give me my keys back!
[19:24] It’s been going off since so long.
[19:30] Did you talk to him?
[19:36] I’m not going to talk to Mansoor about this proposal.
[19:40] How do you expect things to go right if you are not even going to speak to him?
[19:43] Chanda, it’s always better that we make relations with people who are of the same caliber as us.
[19:47] They are very rich people.
[19:50] You want to get me married to a beggar?
[19:52] What are you saying?
[19:55] This is how I am going to talk.
[19:57] You have always had something against me. I don’t know why.
[20:00] Don’t talk rubbish.
[20:02] Alright. I won’t talk absurd.
[20:04] You go and talk to father right now.
[20:06] Call those people tomorrow. And fix the date tomorrow only.
[20:09] You aren’t old enough to be giving me advices.
[20:12] I will think about this and make a decision.
[20:16] I do not need to think or understand anything, mother.
[20:21] Because if I do get married, it is going to be with Shahab only.
[20:38] Babar!
[20:41] What happened?
[20:41] Oh, my hand!
[20:42] Brother, what happened?
[20:45] Oh god! Go and call your father. Go.
[20:46] Father!
[20:49] Sit over here.
[20:50] Let me at least breathe first. I will tell you what happened.
[20:55] What happened! What happened, my son?
[20:58] Um, there were 2-3 guys on a motorcycle
[21:01] They… snatched my wallet and mobile phone on gun point.
[21:05] Oh god!
[21:06] Did you resist?
[21:08] I was furious. What else could I have done?
[21:12] Where, where did all of this take place?
[21:14] In the street behind Umer’s house.
[21:16] I would not have stopped. They parked their motorcycles in front of mine.
[21:19] My son, you should not have resisted.
[21:22] Whatever they were asking for, you should’ve given it to them. To hell with everything!
[21:25] Brother, did you note down the motorcycles number plate?
[21:27] Let’s go to the police and file and complaint.
[21:29] No, no. No need to report to the police.
[21:32] You get up now and come with me to the doctor.
[21:34] No, no father. I am alright. I don’t need to.
[21:35] He will keep saying that. Come on, pick him up.
[21:37] Mother,
[21:39] stop it.
[21:40] Let me just go to my room.
[21:54] I am thinking about how you must have felt when those boys surrounded you from all the sides.
[22:01] I wish I was with you.
[22:04] What’s wrong with you?
[22:06] You think if you had been there
[22:08] and they had misbehaved, I wouldn’t have fought back with them?
[22:11] Your father has made you understand, right?
[22:14] There is no need for you to respond back to anyone.
[22:16] This is how the problem turns bigger.
[22:19] And now you are not going to stay out all night.
[22:21] If you don’t get back home by Maghreb, I will reach till Umer’s shop to get you.
[22:28] Believe me. If you do come to Umer’s shop,
[22:31] he will start bullying me.
[22:32] He’ll tease me by saying that even though I have grown up, my mother still runs after me.
[22:36] It is the mother only that comes after her children, to protect them.
[22:41] I can bear any hurt for my children.
[22:46] Alright now. There is no need to bear anything. I am tired right now.
[22:49] I want to go to sleep. You also go and rest.
[22:52] I am fine!
[22:54] You are not fine
[22:55] I am not going anywhere. I will stay here. Have this glass of milk.
[22:58] No, no, no. I cannot have any more of this. I have had enough of it.
[23:01] Let me lay down now. You are disturbing me now.
[23:06] They got a call from someone. They probably had some work
[23:10] Maybe that’s why they left. Father was telling me your mother had to be someplace else
[23:13] It’s best to make relations with people who hold the same status as us.
[23:16] They’re very rich people.
[23:20] Mom..
[23:23] He has gone to sleep and is better, you also go and have rest.
[23:27] Did you talk to father?
[23:30] Chanda...when did I get a chance?
[23:33] Look at your brother's condition
[23:35] What has happened to you mom? He is fine, nothing has happened to him.
[23:38] You just needed an excuse to delay talking to father. You got it, right?
[23:44] You didn't learn to talk properly...
[23:46] Hmm...I am thinking and even understanding everything.
[23:52] I am understanding everything mom.
[23:55] You only think about Sitara
[23:58] What do I think about Sitara?
[24:00] That if I get married in a very good house, then from where will you get a good proposal for your second daughter?
[24:08] You have gone mad.
[24:09] You always think that I am mad
[24:13] You always take Sitara's side...always
[24:17] Chanda...
[24:20] I am already tensed, please don't bother me further
[24:23] Do you know mom...?
[24:27] If dad wouldn't have been there on my side...you might have killed me long time back.
[24:56] Hasn’t Babar woken up yet?
[24:59] No.
[25:06] What’s wrong? Why aren’t you having breakfast?
[25:13] I don’t feel like it.
[25:19] Look at yourself. Didn’t you sleep at all last night?
[25:28] I did sleep.
[25:32] You aren’t feeling well?
[25:36] Nothing. Just worried about the children and their problems.
[25:40] What about the children?
[25:42] You are always praying. Recite the Ayat-ul-Kursi. If god wills, nothing will happen to the children.
[25:50] I pray to god nothing happens to them.
[25:56] Just like that, my heart is filled with fear.
[26:04] You don’t seem like you’re feeling well. Come, let’s go to the doctor.
[26:07] I am fine.
[26:09] Then you at least take some rest.
[26:13] I will go to sleep once you leave.
[26:16] Sahiba,
[26:19] please start taking care of yourself.
[26:21] When you smile, the world seems to be moving. Otherwise everything stops.
[26:30] Assalam-o-Alaikum, father.
[26:31] Walaikum-a-Salam. It’s good that you are up.
[26:34] Look at your mother, she isn’t feeling quite well today.
[26:36] If you could look after the house today and let her rest.
[26:40] Don’t worry, father. I will take care of everything.
[26:45] Mother, mother! Why aren’t you talking to father?
[26:48] I told you to talk to him yesterday as well. Why aren’t you talking to him?
[26:51] What?
[26:54] Yes, father?
[26:58] Nothing at all. I was just asking mother if brother had eaten breakfast.
[27:04] No, he hasn’t even woken up yet.
[27:07] Make breakfast for him as well when you make it for yourself. And wake him up.
[27:11] Sure.
[27:17] Yes yes, Zahid Sahib.
[27:20] No, I saw your call while I was on the breakfast table.
[27:30] Yes, I am leaving my house right now. Okay. Okay. I am coming. In a while, if god wills.
[27:53] Mom, Chanda’s brother Babar had an encounter with some thieves.
[27:59] I was thinking if you and father could just go and see him… that would been nice.
[28:05] Yes, son. Why not? We will go.
[28:10] Actually, your father had a very important meeting today.
[28:13] If he gets back in time and isn’t very tired, we will go for sure.
[28:19] Anyway my son, now it is our duty to be there for them through all the good and bad times, right?
[28:27] So, you don’t worry. We will go.
[28:30] Thank you, mama.
[28:41] Sitara, please don’t cry.
[28:43] How do I not cry?
[28:45] You should have seen bhai, the condition he was in.
[28:48] Then you would’ve known how much pain he was in. His shirt was soaking in blood.
[28:56] Look, Babar bhai is completely fine.
[28:59] And crying over the time that has passed is like putting yourself through misery, right?
[29:04] Bhai himself was in so much pain. When I saw him, I felt the pain too. What do I do?
[29:09] Yes, he was. But all of yours’ prayers were with him too, right?
[29:16] Now he is completely uninjured, amongst all of us.
[29:21] What if something had happened to him god forbid, then?
[29:24] Nothing happened.
[29:26] If Babar bhai sees you crying like this, he will be even more worried.
[29:33] And, I don’t like these tears in your eyes. Come on, wipe of these tears.
[29:40] And if you don’t take care of yourself, how are you going to take care of him?
[29:45] You go and meet bhai.
[29:49] If I leave, will you start crying again?
[30:00] No, my child. What was the need for you to fight with him?
[30:05] Wah! What are you saying? I felt like taking their lives.
[30:10] Look, son. The times have gotten worse. Take control of your anger.
[30:16] How can I keep control? They brought their pistols and they starting saying...
[30:20] Listen!
[30:23] This tea that you have brought. Look at the way it looks. Take it back,
[30:26] put some poison in it and drink it yourself…
[30:27] However it is, drink it! I am not going to make any more of it.
[30:31] I don’t even expect you to make it another time. Where is mother?
[30:33] Huh! She’s sleeping. Carefree from the world.
[30:37] Do you see this? Look at the way she’s speaking about mother.
[30:40] Not care freely. She had been up all night worrying over my problem.
[30:43] Yes, yes. She can see everyone’s problems. But no one in this house can see mine!
[30:48] What is she saying? Do you see how ill-mannered she has become?
[30:50] Yes, yes. I am ill-mannered. I am crazy. I am out of my mind!
[30:54] Everyone in this house keeps calling me ill mannered!
[30:56] I have been explaining these things to everyone in this house but nobody believes it!
[30:59] What has happened to you?
[31:02] I am trying to explain to you that you need to get hold of your anger.
[31:05] Look, Babar. You are now the head of the family. You need to realize your responsibilities.
[31:14] Come on, drink it.
[31:16] This is such a bad tea, uncle.
[31:17] Drink it, it’s okay.
[31:42] Hello!
[31:46] What happened?
[31:49] Why is my Chanda Rani’s mood so off?
[31:53] This tiny face? What’s the issue, say it!
[31:57] Thank god. At least someone knows that I’m upset. Nobody in the house cares about me.
[32:04] Whether someone figures it out or not.
[32:08] Your uncle is always here to take care of his Gurya Rani.
[32:12] To ask about her issues. Now hurry up, tell me. What’s the issue?
[32:26] There is no issue. Everything is alright.
[32:30] Alright,
[32:34] are you sure?
[32:40] Should I lock your answer?
[32:43] Okay, listen to me. My Chanda Rani will always remember this.
[32:50] Whenever in life, if there is any difficulty, any problem,
[32:56] you will always tell your uncle about it. You will always tell me.
[33:00] Then you will see how your uncle fixes all your difficulties in a snap of fingers.
[33:10] Any problem! Hmm?
[33:15] Alright, let’s play a game. Close your eyes and open your mouth.
[33:21] Uncle!
[33:22] Eyes closed!
[33:26] Open your eyes.
[33:29] Uncle, I have grown up. Chocolate?
[33:31] You can grow as big as you’d like.
[33:34] But for your uncle, you will always remain the small and tiny Chanda Rani.
[33:42] Long live. Always happy.
[34:15] Come on, let it be. Your hands will hurt.
[34:19] I’ll stop when they begin to hurt.
[34:28] Let me get up. I have to go and look over the kitchen.
[34:31] I have done all the work. The dinner is also made.
[34:36] What is Babar doing?
[34:39] Uncle is over. And Danish.
[34:43] Did you ask tea?
[34:44] Yes. Sister made it.
[34:50] I don’t know what kind of pain this is. It just won’t end.
[34:58] You are not just worried about bhai.
[35:04] I would tell if there was just one problem.
[35:08] Right now, the biggest problem for you is sister, right?
[35:17] You don’t want her to get married where she wants to.
[35:27] Have you seen that guy?
[35:32] You must know something! Where do they meet, how long have they known each other?
[35:37] No, mother. I just heard them talking once. And the moment I heard it,
[35:41] I came and told you about it.
[35:44] How do I make this girl understand?
[35:48] You also know it.
[35:50] She won’t understand anything anyone tells her right now.
[35:55] I suggest you to tell father about this
[35:58] Get her married as soon as possible. Before she puts you through any more torture.
[36:03] Alright. You don’t get into these things. Let me get up and go to the kitchen.
[36:26] Listen...
