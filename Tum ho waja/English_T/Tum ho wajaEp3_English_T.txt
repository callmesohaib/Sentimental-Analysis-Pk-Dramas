[00:31] Mom, what happened? You’re still here?
[00:35] What will we do by going there?
[00:40] Chanda’s mother called,
[00:44] she refused to the proposal.
[00:47] What? What? What? What flaw does my son have?
[00:53] We went to their house to ask the hand of their daughter for our son,
[00:58] we gave them respect instead they embarrassed us, they insulted Ghafoor the counselor! Shebi!
[01:12] Mama, what happened? Why did she refuse?
[01:15] What happened after all? I don’t understand anything.
[01:19] I don’t know son but if you’ll ask me I’ll go and beg them for you..
[02:02] Hello?
[02:03] Your mother has refused.
[02:06] What?
[02:19] What happened? Whose call was it?
[02:21] It was Zehra, I had told her to find a suitable match for Chanda.
[02:28] Did she recommend anyone?
[02:29] How is that possible?
[02:31] That is what has happened?
[02:33] Your mother has called my mama and insulted her by refusing, my mama and my baba.
[02:39] Chanda I cannot bear that, I’m telling you.
[02:43] Why are you getting angry? Everything will be fine. I’ll call you back. Okay?
[02:59] Mom, what did you do?
[03:01] What happened?
[03:02] Do you not understand? I’ve made you understand so many times.
[03:06] Look at the way you’re speaking to your mother
[03:07] Let it be, this is between us only
[03:09] No no, one minute. Nothing is private! Look at the way you’re talking, apologize!
[03:15] Dad, I’m only asking mom to..
[03:16] I’ll listen to everything you have to say but after you apologize, apologize right now!
[03:20] Mansoor I told you to let it go.
[03:22] Your tea has gotten cold, I’ll bring you some more. Chanda come with me.
[03:26] There is a limit! The children are getting out of control.
[03:36] You still haven’t called Chanda.
[03:40] Fine, if this is how it will be then fine. Your mother has refused right? Fine.
[03:51] She insulted my mama and baba, now I’ll also see to how this marriage won’t happen.
[03:59] This marriage will happen Chanda.
[04:03] Making you mine has become my ego problem now Chanda.
[04:10] Try and get away.
[04:13] I know, I clearly know why you refused. Why you said no, you couldn’t take it right..
[04:24] Chanda, listen to me..
[04:26] Give me the answer to my question, why did you refuse?
[04:29] I felt as if those people weren’t right for you..
[04:31] Really? You decided yourself that they’re not nice. Did you talk to dad?
[04:37] Dad knows and recognizes people far more better than you! Why did you refuse?
[04:43] What has happened? Stop it. Don’t misbehave so much!
[04:46] I can do a lot more than misbehave..
[04:49] What are you doing?
[04:49] You don’t know me.
[04:51] Who are you calling?
[04:52] Hello?
[04:53] Chanda..
[04:54] Shahab,
[04:55] my mother insulted your parent’s right?
[04:58] She will come to your house and apologize to them, today!
[05:03] Have you gone mad?
[05:04] Yes! Yes I have gone mad!
[05:07] And I can do much worse than this. Go and handle the situation and talk to dad!
[05:12] Why aren’t you understanding?
[05:13] You are not understanding what I’m saying. What is wrong with you?
[05:18] And please for the love of god, don’t cry in front of me, this won’t help. Go and talk to them,
[05:25] go to their house today and talk to dad!
[05:28] Otherwise I hope I don’t run away with Shahab and get married while you keep staring at me like this!
[05:32] Stop it! I will break your face if you talk anymore nonsense! I will strangle you!
[05:56] What is it? Why was she shouting at you so much?
[06:01] There is nothing like that. This always goes on..
[06:04] No, I should know about everything.
[06:07] You scolded her with so much anger. You know how much she minds, she’s your dearest.
[06:13] If she’s my dearest that doesn’t mean I’m supposed to bear her misbehavior and disobedience.
[06:18] What was she saying? Did she apologize after that?
[06:22] She apologized, we hugged it out. Everything is fine.
[06:25] Tell me about Babar, where is he? Did you speak to him? All my attention is on him.
[06:31] He’s on his way, he’s coming. Where is Zain?
[06:35] Zain is at his tuition. He was asking for his tuition fee.
[06:40] Yes, here you go..
[06:50] This is a lot of money.
[06:51] Keep the money you need and keep the rest in our savings.
[07:10] I can’t tolerate your insult. I’ve spoken to Chanda.
[07:18] She has taken a stand and her mother will come here, she will apologize to the both of you.
[07:21] Let it be son..
[07:22] I can’t let it go, it’s the matter of my ego now!
[07:25] Son,
[07:27] don’t waste your time getting tangled with such people
[07:30] in fact I would suggest you talking to Mr. Waqar about Shebi’s marriage with his daughter
[07:43] Yes.. If I’ll talk to him it’s not like he would refuse, he will get his daughter married to him happily.
[07:50] Son, you’ve met the girl right? She’s educated, she’s beautiful, she belongs to a wealthy family.
[07:57] Son, forget about Chanda, marry her..
[08:02] What are you thinking about? Call him, call him right now.
[08:09] Yes..
[08:10] No dad,
[08:12] first off Chanda..
[08:15] And mama you’ll see her mother will come to this house and apologize to you, I’m telling you.
[08:45] Do you know, mom slapped me today for the first time..
[08:52] There’s a limit. Why don’t you talk to your father?
[08:57] I don’t have that much courage..
[08:59] You say that you’re his dearest, he listens to you everything you say..
[09:03] Yes he does and I can also convince him..
[09:09] Then it’s settled. Hang up the phone and go and talk to him.
[09:13] No no, not at all.
[09:19] I can’t do that, I don’t have that much courage.
[09:25] How can I discuss about my own marriage with him?
[09:32] I’ll have to think of something else. I don’t have the courage Shahab, what do I do..
[09:38] Listen do you have anyone in your family or friends who we can talk to?
[09:53] Chanda has gone out fo control...
[09:58] I will talk to Mansoor tomorrow
[10:01] He will make her understand
[10:10] What is it? Why are you awake? Are you worried about something?
[10:20] I was thirsty. I woke up to drink water.
[10:52] There is one person, my uncle. He listens to everything I say. We could talk to him..
[10:59] Then that’s final. We’ll go to your uncle and talk to him.
[11:28] You know how stubborn he is, he’s gotten persistent and now he’ll do what he wants.
[11:36] I’ve been thinking about this all night..
[11:39] Then what did you think off? What will we do?
[11:41] We’ll have to do something..
[11:48] Did you tell me or Shebi told me what work Chanda’s father is in?
[11:56] He must have told us something, he must do some small business or something,
[11:59] I don’t remember..
[12:12] I’ll find out. I’ll go meet her father. I’ll talk to him..
[12:34] Go and talk to them
[12:36] Go to their place today only and talk to dad as well
[12:39] Otherwise I hope I don’t run away with Shahab and get married while you keep staring at me like this!
[12:44] Where is Chanda? She didn't have dinner neither she had breakfast
[12:50] She hasn't even talked
[12:53] She may not take any bold step
[13:18] Uncle, mom is being stubborn. She’s not ready to tell dad. Tell us what to do..
[13:34] She even called my parents and refused to the proposal.
[13:39] Chanda said you could help us that’s why we’re here. Can you help us?
[13:56] Chanda..
[14:03] Chanda?
[14:09] Chanda?
[14:22] Chanda?
[14:24] Chanda!
[14:27] Chanda!
[14:31] I don’t understand.. What do you guys want? What do I do?
[14:45] Actually.. Uncle.. Can you talk to dad?
[14:57] Look, even if I talk to him that would be of no use
[15:04] because my sister in law has mishandled this situation
[15:10] Then what do we do? We don’t know what to do. Help us please..
[15:18] What’s wrong with you two?
[15:21] You’re young, you can do whatever you want
[15:26] and god has given you the right on making your own decisions
[15:33] and honestly I am with you in both of your happiness
[15:38] but I can’t stand by you openly that’s why go and get married right now.
[15:55] Yes Mr. Mujtaba,
[15:57] I understand but I’m leaving for my house right now.
[16:01] It’s possible for me to meet you tomorrow. Sure sure..
[16:06] You’re Mansoor right?
[16:08] Can I talk to you later? Alright thank you.
[16:12] Yes Asalam o alikum, my name is Mansoor.
[16:17] Yes.. Control your daughter.
[16:21] Ask her not to come near my son.
[16:26] Who are you talk about my daughter?
[16:32] My name is Ghafoor counselor!
[16:34] I’m the counselor of my area.
[16:36] I have a lot of power and sources and tell your daughter Chanda not to trap my son!
[16:43] Enough!
[16:45] I will not listen to anything against my daughter, do you understand?
[16:48] Enough! There’s no need to show attitude here! I’ll make your and your daughter’s life miserable.
[16:56] She’s my daughter,
[16:59] she wouldn’t even give slight attention to thugs like you. Now get the hell out of here!
[17:08] You don’t know me, my name is Ghafoor counselor.
[17:17] Disgusting man!
[17:21] Hello?
[17:23] Hello? Babar?
[17:24] Yes mom, what happened? What is it?
[17:26] Come home soon. All hell has broke lose.
[17:30] God help us..
[17:32] Don’t say anything to your father, you just come home soon..
[17:37] Uncle I’ll be back. Let me know when they come..
[18:13] Chanda.. What happened?
[18:19] What we’re doing is right, right?
[18:23] I am with you right, everything is fine.
[18:28] Are we doing something wrong?
[18:31] Not at all. We wanted this right, to get married.
[18:39] Yes..
[18:43] Chanda..
[18:47] Should I call him?
[18:52] should I call him?
[18:55] Yes..
[19:02] Mom!
[19:04] Babar..
[19:04] What happened? You called me so suddenly, is everything okay?
[19:08] Babar.. no everything is not okay.
[19:09] Then tell me what has happened?
[19:12] Chanda has disappeared..
[19:13] Where can Chanda go mom?
[19:14] I don’t know. I don’t know what has happened. I checked the whole house,
[19:17] she isn’t anywhere. I don’t know where she has gone.
[19:20] Then she must have gone to some friend of hers. Did you call her?
[19:23] Yes, her phone was switched off. You try..
[19:25] How can it be switched off?
[19:27] Ask her to come home right now.
[19:29] Did it connect? What happened?
[19:32] Her number is actually switched off.
[19:35] Yes, all of this happens because of you guys! You have given her so much freedom!
[19:39] Oh god, what will happen now?
[19:41] Don’t get too worried now..
[19:43] Just find her wherever she is and bring her before your dad comes.
[19:47] Fine I’ll bring her.. I’ll bring her..
[19:51] Oh god, I hope a miracle happens and Chanda comes home soon
[19:56] Chanda Mansoor daughter of Mansoor Ahmed,
[19:58] do you accept Shadab Ghafoor son of Ghafoor Ahmed
[20:03] with wedding gift of Rs. 2 lacs, in your marriage?
[20:21] I’ll go to Aapi’s friends’ house, where she usually goes. The one who has a really big house.
[20:27] I called and asked over there. She isn’t there either.
[20:30] So she has so many friends, not just that one.
[20:32] You give me any of her friends’ address, I’ll go and get her right away.
[20:36] Your brother has gone to find sister. Just pray that he finds her and brings her back.
[20:41] If we don’t find Chanda then I will…
[20:44] Don’t ruin your health. You come and sit.
[20:46] Go and get water from mother.
[20:54] Shahab Ghafoor, son of Ghafoor Ahmed,
[20:57] do you accept Chanda Mansoor, Bint e Mansoor Ahmed, with 2 lac as Dower, in your marriage?
[21:15] Why are you ruining your health? She will be back. Stop worrying.
[21:18] She has gone with the same guy. I know it.
[21:21] I told you to say yes.
[21:23] How could I have said yes?
[21:25] That boy’s parents did not come to ask for a proposal.
[21:27] They came to threaten and told me to call them while their son was around and refuse to the proposal.
[21:32] Here, take this. Make mother drink the water.
[21:34] Have water. Come on.
[21:35] It won’t pass by my throat.
[21:37] Have a sip. What’s wrong with you, mother? Have water.
[21:48] Assalam o Alaikum, Muraad Chacha.
[21:52] Walaikum a Salam, my child. How are you?
[21:55] I am fine. And today, I am really happy.
[21:59] Of course. My son’s wish is coming true.
[22:04] Muraad Chacha, with your prayers, today, I have married Chanda.
[22:12] Chanda!
[22:17] Where is Chanda? I am asking, where is Chanda!
[22:21] I don’t know.
[22:26] Did you find out anything?
[22:28] Um, I… looked for her at a lot of places. But I couldn’t find out anything.
[22:49] Talk to Chanda.
[22:56] Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
[22:58] Oh, Walaikum a Salam, my princess daughter. You got married!
[23:06] Anyway, it’s good. It’s very good.
[23:12] Congratulations.
[23:13] Congratulations to the both of you. May Allah Almighty always keep you two together.
[23:19] Amen! We are coming to your place only right now.
[23:25] Oh! Yes, yes. It is your own house only. You can come whenever you like. But…
[23:34] But?
[23:41] Look, my child. I think it isn’t appropriate for you to come over to my house right now.
[23:50] My child, you should tell your parents first. And then go over to your in laws.
[23:57] Then after that, whenever your heart says, you can come to your uncle's house.
[24:01] My doors are always open for you.
[24:05] Look, my child. You have to keep one thing in mind. There will be chaos.
[24:12] But your parents must not find out at any cost
[24:16] that I was the one who supported you in this matter.
[24:22] You understand what I am saying, right? Right?
[24:27] Yes,
[24:29] I understand. And you are absolutely right.
[24:32] This is what I should do.
[24:37] Then I will come to you. Khuda Hafiz.
[24:47] They got married.
[24:50] Anyway,
[24:53] it’s good. At least they got married.
[24:57] What hell will it bring when brother and sister in law will find out about this!
[25:03] Chanda, what was he saying?
[25:06] Uncle was saying we should go to my parents first and then to yours.
[25:11] What he’s saying is right. Let’s go.
[25:12] Chanda right now, we cannot go to your house and neither to mine.
[25:18] What does that mean?
[25:21] Come with me.
[25:30] The way that pathetic man spoke about my Chanda… If I could, I would’ve broken his face.
[25:44] I don’t understand. After all, who those people were! What all was happening?
[25:51] Our areas counsellor? He’s asking for Chandas proposal.
[25:57] What? Why didn’t you tell me about this before?
[26:01] Mansoor. Those people did not seem right to me at all. But…
[26:09] But what, mother?
[26:16] It was Chandas stubbornness that she would only get married over there.
[26:48] Chanda.
[26:56] You know it, right?
[27:00] That we have to spend all of our lives together. We have to see every happiness together.
[27:07] You will forget about everything. Didn’t you see? Our love was true. We got married.
[27:20] Now tomorrow, we will go and meet your parents.
[27:24] They will see us happy and forget about what happened today.
[27:27] I hope that is what happens.
[27:29] It will.
[27:32] Look at me.
[27:36] And now smile.
[27:40] Now we’re married. Just once.
[27:49] And listen, I have to go for an important work. I’ll be right back.
[27:54] Where are you going? I am not going to stay here alone.
[27:57] You aren’t a small child, right?
[27:58] No. I am not going to stay here.
[28:01] Chanda, I am telling you, right? I am coming back, okay?
[28:08] Don’t go, please.
[28:10] I will be right back.
[28:14] Come back soon!
[28:17] Lock the door.
[28:19] Yes.
[28:31] What happened? You look very furious?
[28:36] Babar! Where are you going? Wait!
[28:40] Assalam o Alaikum.
[28:44] What happened, brother? Our Babar has left in a lot of anger.
[28:55] Brother, is everything alright? Bhabhi is crying. What happened?
[30:54] Forgive me
[30:59] but this is all your fault. You ruined our family’s reputation in dust.
[31:05] Muraad, she is my daughter. I can take care of her however I want, but I can take care of her.
[31:13] Let it be, Bhabhi jee.
[31:15] What did you have to handle? You should have gone to brother. You should have told him.
[31:24] He would’ve handled it his way.
[31:29] But Bhabhi jee, all your life,
[31:31] you never gave my brother any respect. So, even now, you did exactly that.
[31:40] I do give Mansoor…
[31:41] What about me? What about me!
[31:48] This is how you have trained them?
[31:53] You have not left me in a position where I can show my face to the world.
[31:59] Where will we go with whatever little respect we have left? Who will we go to?
[32:06] I don’t understand where do I go? What do I do?
[32:11] Bhai Sahib, what happened? Are you feeling alright?
[32:14] Bhabhi jee, what are you looking at? Go and get water.
[32:19] Everything will be alright. Have faith.
[32:24] This is a test from Allah Almighty. If god wills, Allah will make everything alright.
[32:31] Bhabhi jee, get the water already!
[33:15] Chanda.
[33:23] Where were you? I was waiting for you since so long. Do you know how scared I was?
[33:28] I called you. You didn’t even take my call.
[33:29] Chanda! Relax. What has happened to you?
[33:35] Do you think I will leave you?
[33:38] I have gotten married to you. I will be with you for the rest of my life.
[33:45] Look. I went to buy you clothes.
[33:49] What was the need for that?
[33:51] There was. And… one more thing.
[34:02] This is for you.
[34:12] And Chanda, because we got married with such decency, that I could not do anything for you.
[34:18] But this… This is our marriage’s first gift.
[34:30] For my wife.
[34:40] Did you like it?
[34:47] It's very beautiful
[34:54] You are beautiful
[35:04] How dare that cheap man! What is his status that he would misbehave with you!
[35:09] That cheap man, a gentleman innocent man!
[35:15] He will have to face the consequences for the things he said.
[35:20] I will tell Shebi, he will deal with him on his own.
[35:22] Don’t you dare! You don’t have to tell Shebi.
[35:29] I will tell Shebi about this in my own style.
[35:33] And I will talk to him in a way that he won’t even look in that girls’ direction.
[35:40] Then call him! Ask him to come.
[35:42] Yes. Let me call him.
[35:47] God knows what people my son has gotten himself associated with!
[35:50] His number is going off. Did he tell you where he was going?
[35:53] When does he ever tell me before going? He stays out all night.
[35:57] Where is Shahab? Leave me! Where is Shahab? Shahab! Where is Shahab?
[36:01] Where is Shahab? Where is he? Shahab!
[36:05] Wait a minute! Who are you and what tone are you speaking in?
[36:09] You will find out who I am and what tone I am speaking in. First let me get hold of my sister.
[36:23] So what you are trying to say is that my son has kidnapped your sister?
[36:28] Yes. He has brainwashed my sister.
[36:32] He has shown her the wrong path. Where is my sister? Chanda! Chanda!
[36:41] Oh! So you are Chandas brother?
[36:44] Did your father not understand properly that he decided to send you over here?
[36:50] I will get back to you later, on the way you mistreated my father.
[36:58] Give me my sister back otherwise…
[37:02] Otherwise what?
[37:06] Otherwise, I will deal with you and your son in a way
[37:09] that you won’t even be able to recognize each other.
[37:11] I will…!
[37:15] Where is my sister?
[37:17] Stay away from me! Get out!
[37:19] Where is my sister? Where is my sister, tell me?
[37:21] Take him away!
[37:22] Where is my sister, tell me! Where is she? Shahab!
[37:31] He wanted to fix his characterless sister with my son! It’s good that my son got saved.
[37:38] Tara…
[37:44] Did Shebi kidnap his sister…
[37:51] No, no! Shebi is not like that!
