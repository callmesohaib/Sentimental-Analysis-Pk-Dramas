[00:30] I killed him!
[00:40] What happened? Who did you kill? What are you saying Babar?
[00:43] Nothing.. nothing..
[00:46] Where did it go? How did she lose the ring?
[00:53] What do I tell you..
[00:57] I myself am so worried.
[00:59] I don’t understand what has gotten into Chanda.
[01:05] She’s always stays lost these days..
[01:10] For instance she’s been crying since yesterday,
[01:14] she’s saying that,
[01:16] what will I tell Shebi if he’ll ask me about the ring.
[01:22] She’ll tell him the truth that she lost it.
[01:27] You surprise me sometimes..
[01:31] you’re talking as if you don’t know your own daughter.
[01:36] you’re talking as if you don’t know your own daughter.
[01:41] She’s insisting that I go and get her the exact same ring.
[01:45] You tell me, can I afford to buy a gold ring for her? That is why I came to you..
[01:52] I also don’t have any money..
[01:54] Whatever money I had was spent on the hospital bills, doctor and medicines.
[01:59] Okay.
[02:03] You must have prepared for Chanda’s wedding, something or the other..
[02:18] It’s not much..
[02:20] I’ve gotten a few things made..
[02:22] Then bring me something from those things..
[02:25] I mean to say when will it come in handy if not now?
[02:29] Whatever you will give me, I’ll sell it and get the exact ring made for your daughter.
[02:39] What are you thinking about? Go and get it quickly.
[02:45] Okay.
[02:59] Shebi and Chanda you two are very lucky for me, so lucky.
[03:07] May god always keep you two together. Amen!
[03:14] Ameen sum Ameen
[03:17] I’ve gotten more worried after whatever brother said.
[03:21] I don’t understand what to do..
[03:25] You’ll have to get a hold of yourself Sitara.
[03:28] You’re the only one who can take care of aunty and uncle in these circumstances.
[03:34] When will everything go back to normal Danish?
[03:40] I’ve started to feel suffocated in this environment
[03:42] Very soon. Have faith in God.
[03:47] I’ll come today and we’ll try taking aunty and uncle somewhere out today
[04:11] I had to see this day also..
[04:14] Asalam o alikum.
[04:16] Are you feeling okay?
[04:18] I’m fine.
[04:21] You look worried.
[04:29] Since you’ve come to my house,
[04:33] this house has started to feel like home to me.
[04:38] You’re so skillful,
[04:41] totally different from your mother.
[04:46] My sister in law never liked me and now..
[04:57] What now uncle?
[05:00] I’ve become my sister in law’s criminal by giving you harbor.
[05:09] When she found out she became so angry towards me, so angry as if I had committed a very big sin.
[05:19] So did you not say anything to her?
[05:22] I did.
[05:25] I said this Chanda is my daughter, she’s my blood.
[05:33] I cannot leave her all alone like that but she is full of ego.
[05:50] Now take a look at our Shahab, he’s such a sweet and innocent boy,
[05:59] you chose him for yourself
[06:03] but your mother didn’t like your choice and refused to the proposal without telling my brother
[06:14] You tell me yourself,
[06:16] why would she want you to stay with me in my house in such circumstances?
[06:23] What happened?
[06:26] What do you think?
[06:29] A father should be happy whose daughter has run away from home?
[06:34] Babar was right,
[06:36] everyone is only talking about us.
[06:40] The whole city knows.
[06:44] Whenever I go out it feels as if every person is shouting and saying ‘
[06:47] look, that’s the man whose daughter ran away from home’
[06:55] What lacked in my love,
[06:58] in my upbringing that my daughter did this?
[07:02] That she left us like this?
[07:04] Look the doctor has asked you not to take a lot of stress,
[07:09] anger is not good for you.
[07:12] Sitara go get water for your father.
[07:17] Listen Mansoor whatever that has happened..
[07:20] Be quiet, please be quiet for the love of god. Be quiet!
[07:30] Can a mother think in such a way for her own child?
[07:38] The truth is that your mother wants Shahab to leave you
[07:49] and for you to get helpless
[07:52] and go back to their house feeling humiliated so that her ego gets satisfied.
[08:05] And all that my brother does is act like a slave in front of his wife.
[08:11] His eyes haven’t opened even after all that happened
[08:17] but there’s a chance that he’s quiet because of his children
[08:28] Dad..
[08:37] What you did was wrong.
[08:41] All of us are very sad but the most important thing for me is your health.
[08:46] Please take care of yourself. If anything happens to you god forbid..
[08:51] Stop talking nonsense.
[08:55] You’re her sister only, right? You will do the same that she has done.
[09:03] Today, you tell me. With whom are you involved with?
[09:09] And when are you planning to runaway from this house?
[09:12] Mansoor..
[09:13] Why are you saying such things dad?
[09:15] No no tell me
[09:16] No no dad
[09:17] You and the respect of this house is the most important thing to me.
[09:21] I can never do such a thing, never. What are you saying..
[09:25] You should have spoken to dad. You should have told him everything.
[09:30] Dad would have talked to mom, he would have scolded her.
[09:32] Dad loves me a lot, he can do anything for me!
[09:37] What love?
[09:39] What kind of love?
[09:42] Have you forgotten what happened to you at your father’s house?
[09:49] Brother is not to be blamed for it.
[09:54] My sister in law has brainwashed my brother in such a way that loving you is another story,
[10:04] he doesn’t even want to hear your name
[10:08] and she has also poisoned Babar against you.
[10:17] Anyways let it be, let her be how she is, forget about it.
[10:27] I’m sad to know that mom can stoop so low.
[10:37] How can a mother even think like that for her own child? I hate mom!
[10:44] Those mothers must be different,
[10:50] your mother can do anything,
[10:56] anything..
[10:58] I know her when you weren’t even born.
[11:03] My brother is blindfolded,
[11:08] he can’t see anything besides his wife.
[11:13] We have been bearing my brother’s mistake since ages.
[11:17] I tolerated whatever she did to me, I forgave her for it
[11:25] but if someone will do something bad to my daughter
[11:31] then I can’t tolerate that, no way.
[11:37] I can’t tolerate that, whoever it maybe,
[11:40] be it my brother, my sister in law or whoever it maybe.
[11:53] Why are you upsetting yourself?
[12:00] Nothing will go wrong.
[12:02] Your uncle is always with you even if nobody is.
[12:08] Here, drink your tea, it’s getting cold. Drink it..
[12:20] What are you saying? What has happened to you?
[12:22] Why? Am I saying anything wrong?
[12:24] Whatever I’m saying is right.
[12:27] Before she humiliates us I should kick her out of this house.
[12:34] What?
[12:35] Right? Get out. Get out.
[12:36] Leave her. Leave her! What has gotten into you Mansoor?
[12:55] You respect is more dear to me than my life.
[12:58] If you think I will cause harm to your respect then kill me and I will not object,
[13:07] I promise I will not object dad but don’t be upset with me, I can’t bear that.
[13:11] Don’t kick me out of the house, I will die dad..
[13:56] Where is the mechanics shop?
[13:59] Tell him to fix my jeep! I’ve been standing here..
[14:02] Be careful! Be careful!
[14:14] If you don’t know how to ride it then why do you take it out on the road?
[14:19] Go do your work otherwise you will get beaten up.
[14:20] What do you mean?
[14:21] I spared you that day because of your sister. Do you understand?
[14:26] Really? You spared me that day but you won’t have obligation today right?
[14:30] What will you do?
[14:30] You tell me, what will you do?
[14:31] What will you do?
[14:32] You spared me that day right? Don’t come near me!
[14:46] I will not spare you! Do you understand?
[14:47] I will kill you! I will kill you! Leave me!
[14:51] Leave me!
[14:51] I will kill you! Leave me!
[14:56] Tell me today, with whom are you involved with?
[14:59] And when are you planning to runaway from this house?
[15:08] I know what you’re going through.
[15:17] It’s like someone’s evil eye affected the happiness of this house.
[15:24] Mansoor loves all of us very much..
[15:32] I’m not worried, I know dad loves all of us very much.
[15:39] I also know that it will take time for things to get better.
[15:45] You don’t get upset by your father,
[15:49] he has gone through a trauma..
[15:52] How can I get upset by dad, mom?
[15:58] You also don’t worry.
[16:03] Dad will also start smiling and laughing again Inshallah.
[16:13] This Babar has grown some wings.
[16:15] He’s become very rigid!
[16:17] If he wasn’t Chanda’s brother then I would…
[16:19] No, no, son.
[16:22] You don’t pay much attention to him. Leave him, let him go.
[16:25] He’s exactly like his mother.
[16:27] Ill mannered, arrogant, egoistic!
[16:29] Let’s not talk about him.
[16:31] You tell me, how is Chanda?
[16:34] How would she be? She’s fine.
[16:37] I try my best to keep her happy.
[16:41] But it is true that her father has brought her up with a lot of care
[16:47] and I am just a poor man.
[16:52] What comparison is there between me and Bhai Sahib?
[16:54] Uncle, this… This is some money…
[17:01] No, no, son.
[17:02] Look, this is why I don’t tell you anything. You make me feel embarrassed, son…
[17:09] You are my son in law, it doesn’t feel nice at all…
[17:11] Uncle, you’re saying the same things again?
[17:12] I am not your son in law. I am your son!
[17:15] And do you keep a difference between me and Danish?
[17:18] Hold this.
[17:19] Come on, keep it.
[17:22] But son… I have just been praying for one thing these days
[17:28] and that’s that may Allah Almighty bless every parent with a son like you.
[17:44] Look, don’t lose your temper when you talk to him. Stay calm.
[17:59] Wait!
[18:05] What, do you want to take your fathers’ life?
[18:13] What have I done, dad?
[18:15] What have you done?
[18:18] Some inspector called.
[18:21] He was saying that he’ll break you bones apart if you mess with that boy…
[18:24] I am the one who will break that boy’s bones,
[18:27] if he ever comes in front of me again.
[18:29] Babar! What are you saying!
[18:31] You stay quiet!
[18:33] I am talking, right?
[18:34] Mansoor, for god sake… Babar, you…
[18:36] You!
[18:39] You won’t live here anymore!
[18:45] My Bhabi is unfortunate!
[18:48] That she won’t accept a son in law like you.
[18:51] She has brainwashed everyone against my diamond like son!
[18:56] My son, now I only wish for one thing
[18:59] which is that you take my daughter to your house with respect so that I can die peacefully!
[19:07] Uncle, what are you saying? May Allah Almighty bless you with a long life!
[19:11] You are the only one who stood by us through the difficult times.
[19:16] We will be forever be in your debt.
[19:20] By the way, where is Chanda?
[19:22] Go! Go and meet her. She’ll become lively and happy when she sees you. Go!
[19:28] And you, don’t stress so much.
[19:31] Just like that, son…
[19:50] What do you mean I won’t live here?
[19:53] Actually, your dad is making arrangements for you in Islamabad or Lahore.
[19:56] You can start your work…
[19:57] I am not going anywhere.
[20:01] Tell him not to piss me off any further!
[20:05] And you tell him
[20:08] that I won’t leave you guys and go anywhere during these difficult and problematic times.
[20:12] That’s it!
[20:17] I don’t understand what I should do with these children of mine!
[20:20] Don’t you see how worried he is?
[20:23] He doesn’t want to leave us in this situation!
[20:25] Situation?
[20:27] So he shouldn’t put us through more difficulties either!
[20:31] He keeps fighting with someone or the other!
[20:35] What do I do? Where do I go and die!
[20:38] You don’t take stress.
[20:39] I shouldn’t take stress?
[20:41] With children like these, a person shouldn’t be stressed?
[20:44] I will talk to him, okay?
[20:48] I will talk to him.
[21:14] We have become so distant from each other.
[21:19] This is not why I got married.
[21:23] Neither did I get the peace of living with my in-laws nor with my parents.
[21:29] For how long will I stay here like this?
[21:34] I am trying.
[21:38] I will take you home once mama and dad are convinced.
[21:42] Just give me some more time.
[21:44] Time, time, time! How much time do you need?
[21:49] I have had enough now.
[21:52] I don’t care if mom and dad don’t get convinced now.
[21:56] We will buy a small house of our own and live over there!
[22:00] You are listening to what I’m saying, right?
[22:05] Chanda, what happened?
[22:06] I don’t know. I feel dizzy.
[22:08] Sit, sit.
[22:12] What happened? Are you even okay?
[22:15] I haven’t been feeling well since morning. I feel dizzy.
[22:20] You listen to what I’m telling you. We will buy a separate house?
[22:26] We will. But let’s go to the doctor right now, okay?
[22:32] I am holding my hands together in front of you, don’t mess with him!
[22:36] Your dad is already worried.
[22:39] Consider it as the fact that he has gotten a new life.
[22:41] Instead of taking care of him and being grateful, you’re giving him more stress?
[22:44] I am giving him stress?
[22:47] Am I giving him stress or is it the other way around?
[22:49] You go and make him understand
[22:51] that I am not leaving this house and going anywhere! That’s it!
[22:53] I will make your dad understand. But you will not mess with Shahab again!
[22:57] When was I messing with Shahab, mom!
[23:00] It was him who came in my way.
[23:03] And you should thank god that I got control over my anger
[23:05] otherwise I would have killed him!
[23:07] Why have you all become our enemies!
[23:09] Why are you after us, why have you destroyed our peace!
[23:12] It’s better that I die and get rid of all this!
[23:16] Mother, come on
[23:20] Listen to me. Listen to me!
[23:26] Alright, I… I won’t fight with anyone. I promise you.
[23:31] I promise you that I won’t ever fight with Shahab again.
[23:34] Not just Shahab, I won’t fight with anyone!
[23:37] And even if Shahab gets in my way again, I will just change my route.
[23:42] Okay?
[23:44] I cannot make you and dad upset because of me.
[23:48] And then you tell me yourself.
[23:50] Can I leave you guys in a time like this and go? Tell me? No, right?
[23:59] Now, stop this crying.
[24:03] Congratulations to the both of you on this good news.
[24:07] What do you mean, doctor?
[24:08] It means that your wife is pregnant!
[24:15] I am prescribing you some medicine, take them regularly.
[24:20] And don’t take any on your own.
[24:23] Yes.
[24:30] This is your amount, keep it.
[24:33] Mine?
[24:35] Yes. You shared about your financial issues in the office, right?
[24:38] But then you didn’t come to take it so I thought I would just come over and give it myself.
[24:42] I am grateful to you but I needed this money for Babar.
[24:46] I don’t need it anymore.
[24:49] Look. It was a matter of your house’s woman, right?
[24:53] Now, if you felt bad about something that I said then I am sorry. Forgive me?
[24:59] No, no, sir. Don’t embarrass me.
[25:02] You are upset with me.
[25:05] How can I be upset with you? I don’t know why you are feeling this way.
[25:11] Actually, I put myself in your shoes and thought about it. Anyway,
[25:17] you and I have been working together since a lot of years now.
[25:21] You have never made me upset, you always did your work with sincerity.
[25:29] If you ask me the truth, Wajid Sahib. You have done a lot of favors on me.
[25:34] You never left me alone.
[25:37] Although, there are a thousand people in the city who can do the work that I do for you.
[25:43] So in all this time, we have become familiar with each other, right?
[25:48] We understand each other’s pain.
[25:52] Keep the money.
[25:56] Oh, I don’t see the kids and Bhabi? Won’t you get tea served?
[26:02] Actually, they have all gone out somewhere with Babar.
[26:05] I… I will go make tea and bring it myself.
[26:07] Oh, no, no, no. Sit. How is your health?
[26:11] Grateful to Allah.
[26:24] I….
[26:32] What?
[26:52] Sorry.
[26:55] You have given me the world’s biggest happiness.
[27:00] How can I be upset with you for this?
[27:06] Alright, listen.
[27:08] Ask for whatever you want!
[27:10] Are you sure? Will I get what I ask for?
[27:14] I swear upon you. Try asking and you will see.
[27:18] Your support.
[27:21] That is with you.
[27:24] Forever and ever.
[27:27] So then alright.
[27:32] Take me to your house right now.
[27:42] Chanda… You know that this can’t happen, right?
[27:50] You told me I could ask for whatever I wanted.
[27:55] So I asked for it. Can you give it to me or not?
[28:11] Muraad uncle?
[28:14] Hello?
[28:16] Yes, Muraad uncle?
[28:17] Hello, yes? Shebi, son. Listen to me carefully.
[28:21] You do not have to come home right now.
[28:24] Why?
[28:26] Why shouldn’t we come home?
[28:31] Oh! That is a problem.
[28:36] Alright here, talk to Chanda.
[28:41] Hello? Yes, uncle?
[28:44] Your mom has brought Sitara and Babar all of a sudden.
[28:50] What did mom do?
[28:52] She was saying that they were getting worried.
[28:54] Babar forced her and brought them.
[28:57] But my child, I think this is one of your moms’ tactics.
[29:04] Obviously, my child. Why would she want you to stay at your uncle’s house in peace?
[29:14] I will live, uncle.
[29:16] And I will live with you only!
[29:22] I will see what all she can do with me.
[29:28] Alright, my child.
[30:01] Muraad!
[30:03] Did you talk to them?
[30:04] Yes, Bhabhi Jee. I spoke to them. They have stayed for dinner.
[30:12] You just have tea and get going.
[30:15] They must have gotten very worried.
[30:18] Obviously. I’ll go get samosas for you.
[30:31] Chanda, why are you getting so worried?
[30:33] Relax.
[30:34] You should’ve at least taken me home!
[30:36] Alright. What would have happened then?
[30:38] I would have stood firm and spoken to all of them. After all, what have we done?
[30:49] Thank you.
[30:50] What is it that we have done after all?
[30:52] It would have been of no use.
[30:54] All of them would have insulted you together
[30:56] and you know that I wouldn’t like that.
[30:57] I have bared a lot already.
[31:00] Why are we getting scared and hiding, what have we done!
[31:03] Chanda, it is not about getting scared.
[31:05] It’s about uncles’ respect.
[31:07] Have you forgotten who stood by us in our difficult times?
[31:11] And would it be a nice thing if today because of us, his relationship with his brother gets ruined?
[31:16] He is the only sensible person in your entire family!
[31:27] Alright, now. Think about it.
[31:30] How happy is he going to be when you get home and give him such a big happy news?
[31:38] Yes.
[31:42] You are right.
[31:47] I have always given him the status of my father.
[31:52] My heart feels at peace whenever he is happy.
[31:57] And anyway, why should I waste my precious moments thinking about the people
[32:01] who don’t even care about me? Why should I worry about them?
[32:06] Exactly!
[32:07] Now you’re talking sense!
[32:10] Don’t ruin your mood now. I am really hungry. Tell me, what should we order?
[32:25] What happened, do you need something?
[32:28] It feels very nice…
[32:30] to see you working in your house.
[32:36] My house? But this house is yours.
[32:40] Yes. So it’s yours too then.
[32:54] I am anxiously waiting for the day when you become my bride
[33:02] and come to this house. You love me, right?
[33:15] You’re her sister only, right?
[33:17] You will do the same that she has done.
[33:23] Today, you tell me. With whom are you involved with?
[33:39] No
[34:00] I can understand, what are you going through
[34:08] Because we are also going through the same
[34:15] When parents see anger in the eyes of their children they get scared
[34:23] And that fear makes them angry
[34:32] Are you getting my point?
[34:35] Yes
[34:37] I know that you people are worried about me, but
believe me that I also worry about you people.
[34:45] I cannot leave both of you in this condition
so please stop saying this that I should leave
[34:52] Okay, don't go
[34:55] But try to take a little responsibility, these are tough times
[35:03] Can't we forget the past and move on?
[35:08] You might not believe me, I try alot
to forget it but people don't let me do it
[35:17] Don't give importance to what people say
[35:20] More you react on those things more
people will taunt you and try to tease you
[35:29] You know that when parents get older they have their children's suipport after God.
[35:40] I don't know how many days I have left with me
[35:47] But son of something happens to you then I will die
[35:52] What are you saying dad?
[35:56] God forbid nothing will happen to you
[36:00] Stop worrying about me, I promise
I will try to control my anger and
[36:05] I will ignore what people say but
if again you talked about dying....
[36:26] Mom, I am very very happy today
[36:28] Oh wow! After a longtime I have seen
my son so happy. What is the matter?
