[00:47] This is my home now, mom.
[00:53] I have to die in this house only now.
[01:00] I hope you’re happy now..
[01:34] But mom, all I have are tears in my eyes..
[01:43] I hope you’re happy now..
[01:45] Don’t say that.
[01:49] What mother would want to see tears in her daughter’s eyes?
[01:56] I won’t let you stay here,
[01:58] come with me.
[02:00] Where will you take me?
[02:02] Where?
[02:03] In the house where you sprew hate in my brother’s heart for me.
[02:11] So much hate that wherever he sees me, he wants to kill me.
[02:16] He wants me to die!
[02:18] You’ll take me in that house?
[02:21] Nobody is at fault, nobody mom.
[02:26] I ran away from home and got married, it’s my fault.
[02:32] I will get punished for this mistake for the rest of my life.
[02:42] She brought the proposal right?
[02:45] What could have happened if you would have said yes?
[02:46] Everyone would have accepted everything happily,
[02:48] she wouldn't have been taking out her vengeance on me because of you!
[02:52] All of this wouldn't have happened to me.
[02:55] All this happened because you refused.
[02:59] I didn’t refuse Chanda..
[03:02] She’s right. You shouldn’t have refused.
[03:05] If you hadn’t refused then she wouldn't have to bear all this
[03:09] and the humiliation we faced, we wouldn't have to face that too.
[03:17] What are you standing here for? Get out of my house! Get out!
[03:32] Please go from here,
[03:34] please go from here for the love of God.
[03:35] Stop interfering in my life.
[03:38] Let me be and don’t ever come here again. Don’t ever come here!
[03:58] Are you satisfied now?
[04:00] Have you had enough?
[04:03] What are you standing here for? Get out of my house
[04:06] or should I throw you out of here? Get going!
[04:37] I had known from the start that his intentions weren’t pure.
[04:40] If you had told me before then I would’ve gone and broken his legs.
[04:46] What could have happened by doing all that?
[04:48] He wouldn’t have been able to come here.
[04:52] Does anybody else know?
[04:56] Mom knows..
[04:58] What about Babar brother?
[05:01] I don't want to tell him anything.
[05:05] According to him he is an angel
[05:09] and if I say anything to him he'll scold me instead.
[05:14] That’s outrageous, can’t Babar brother see what’s happening?
[05:23] I don't know till when will I have to bear that man’s impure stares.
[05:38] Sitara, please don't worry.
[05:42] I have spoken to aunty regarding you and me.
[05:49] What?
[05:50] What else?
[05:51] I have told dad to come here and ask your hand in marriage from aunty after I leave for Dubai.
[05:58] But Danish..
[05:59] But what?
[06:01] Do you not want to marry me?
[06:06] Sitara, does your heart have no space for me?
[06:12] Trust me Sitara, I will keep you happy.
[06:18] And there is only one purpose of me going to Dubai,
[06:21] so that I can end aunty’s problems.
[06:25] I have decided that all of us will live together after marriage.
[06:29] I will try to come back and get married to you after 3 to 4 months.
[06:33] I don’t want to hurt your feelings but you don’t understand..
[06:37] What do I not understand?
[06:41] I understand everything. I’m sorry that I couldn't do anything for you Sitara.
[06:55] Babar brother, it isn’t like that!
[06:57] Brother! Brother! Brother!
[07:00] what was happening? What was happening?
[07:03] Please make my brother understand that there is nothing going on..
[07:05] What do I make him understand? Everything is happening because of you!
[07:07] What shamelessness were you doing? What shamelessness were you doing?
[07:09] Babar, listen to me! Babar, listen to me!
[07:12] What?
[07:12] All this is happening because of her. She was upto this behind our backs!
[07:16] It isn’t like that. Why are you doing this..
[07:18] You be quiet! All this is happening because of you!
[07:20] What she's saying is wrong. There is nothing going on between us!
[07:22] Who are you to say she’s wrong?
[07:23] Come here!
[07:25] What you were doing here, what was that? Get out! Get out of here!
[07:29] : Get out! Don’t ever come here again!
[07:31] There is nothing going between us. I don’t know why she’s saying that.
[07:33] I don’t know.. I can never disrespect you all..
[07:35] Quiet!
[07:36] Quiet!
[07:38] Our respect?
[07:39] What about the shamelessness you were doing standing over there which I saw from my own eyes,
[07:47] What are you doing? Have you gone mad?
[07:53] I will get punished for this mistake for the rest of my life.
[07:59] Please go from here for the love of God.
[08:01] Stop interfering in my life.
[08:03] Let me be and don’t ever come here again. Don’t ever come here!
[08:18] I will kill you from my own bare hands, I will kill you!
[08:21] What’s wrong with you? Why are you hitting her?
[08:23] Have you gone mad?
[08:24] Have you gone mad Zain?
[08:25] Zain!
[08:26] Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? What’s happening here?
[08:29] I’ll tell you what’s happening!
[08:30] One minute! I’m asking him and not you!
[08:33] I should be the one asking you, where had you gone at this time?
[08:37] : I went out for some work..
[08:39] What work?
[08:40] Just because of your irresponsible behavior, Chanda ranway first and now her!
[08:45] She was having an affair with Danish!
[08:47] And I’m sure she was also planning to run away.
[08:51] Mom, brother has misunderstood,
[08:53] I would never do something which would cause embarrassment to you.
[08:57] I haven't done anything..
[08:58] She’s lying! She’s lying! What had I seen then?
[09:02] Weren’t you standing with Danish when I came in?
[09:04] She’s talking nonsense! Liar!
[09:06] Stop it!
[09:07] Nor is she shameless and neither are his intentions impure but yes,
[09:12] Danish likes her and he has spoken to me about it.
[09:15] That means you knew everything regarding Sitara and Danish’s affair
[09:18] and you were letting this happen on purpose.
[09:20] Don’t twist and turn the matter Erum
[09:22] She isn't twisting anything, she’s right.
[09:26] She’s saying what we saw when we came in.
[09:29] Now I’ve understood that because of your bigoted behavior,
[09:33] dad died a painful death but mom, I am not weak like dad.
[09:38] I will not spare anyone if such shamelessness continues in this house
[09:43] and Danish won’t enter this house again. Do you understand?
[09:48] Babar..
[10:13] Show me..
[10:15] He has beaten you with such ruthlessness.
[10:18] You still have a mark from the slap.
[10:21] Why did he beat you? Does he think you’re some orphan or something?
[10:24] He thinks what his wife is saying is the truth.
[10:27] What truth? Tell me something..
[10:30] That Sitara and me.. Let it be dad. Babar has lost his mind.
[10:37] I will fix his mind right now.
[10:41] How will that help?
[10:42] He will misbehave with you, the matter will prolong and the situation will get much worse.
[10:47] Then what do you want?
[10:48] You want me to keep sitting here quietly after seeing what has happened?
[10:53] No. You will go with me to their house tonight,
[10:58] ask Sitara’s hand in marriage and get us married tomorrow only.
[11:00] What?
[11:03] Marriage?
[11:07] What are you saying son? Your flight for Dubai is in a while..
[11:12] I am not going anywhere dad
[11:14] and besides I want to take Sitara out of that house and bring her here.
[11:17] Look son, don’t make a decision out of emotions.
[11:21] Don’t kick away your good fortune.
[11:23] Dad, my good fortune is written with Sitara and I have already decided.
[11:28] You have made a wrong decision! Look son, I mean to say don’t think emotionally.
[11:37] Let go of your anger, cool down and then think and besides,
[11:40] even if I do what you’re asking me off and I talk to them regarding your marriage,
[11:46] what do you think? Will Babar agree? Not at all.
[11:49] His ego will kick in, I know him.
[11:53] Look son, now is not the time to make rash decisions but to make smart decisions.
[11:57] Have some patience..
[11:58] But dad..
[11:59] It’s my promise to you that I will talk to them regarding your marriage with Sitara
[12:03] and I will not give up until they get convinced.
[12:06] Trust your father and right now, it is very important for you to go to Dubai.
[12:10] Try to understand the situation.
[12:12] I am here so you go. Just go and get ready.
[12:16] I am here for you. Good boy.
[12:17] Everything will be fine.
[12:21] Quickly, we’re getting late for the airport.
[12:32] Good that his and Sitara’s story ended.
[12:40] Babar.. Babar, please have some water. You are very angry right now,
[12:44] please don't torture to yourself.
[12:46] For the love of God please be quiet for sometime, don't talk too much.
[12:50] I can understand that you're angry right now.
[12:52] You have a lot of anger inside of you
[12:54] and you feel helpless that you can't do anything about it.
[12:56] Do one thing, take your anger out on me, I won’t say a word.
[13:01] For the love Of God, can you please be quiet? Can you not understand?
[13:08] Babar I was just..
[13:10] Then don't stay with me.
[13:12] Why are you staying with me?
[13:13] Listen, be quiet before I say something that I would regret.
[13:18] Quiet.
[13:22] My head is hurting right now!
[13:25] Should I massage it for you?
[13:26] Let me be! You’re after my life.
[13:30] : I'll bring up a painkiller for you then..
[13:34] Do you really want to do something for me?
[13:37] Then do one thing, get me some poison
[13:40] so that I die once and for all and all these problems come to an end.
[13:45] Babar..
[13:53] Mom, brother beat Danish brother so brutally and misbehaved with api also.
[13:59] He has become so bad.
[14:03] You have a lot of homework to do, go and do it.
[14:05] No, I’m fine here. I'm not doing any homework.
[14:11] Api, how much more will you cry? Should I bring water?
[14:20] This wouldn't have ever happened if you would have been here. Where have you gone?
[14:28] To Chanda.
[14:31] God knows till when will life keep testing me.
[14:35] What has happened?
[14:39] She lost her child.
[14:50] She is living a very torturous life.
[14:53] The conditions we are living in are nothing compared to the torture Chanda is facing.
[15:05] They have started beating her also.
[15:15] What do I do to bring peace to my children’s life.
[15:25] I had thought of bringing her here but..
[15:30] Make way..
[15:35] Here you go api, have water.
[15:36] Actually I was looking for the medicine box,
[15:41] Babar has a headache so where is it kept?
[15:45] There is a box lying above the fridge, it has medicines inside. Take it from there.
[15:49] Okay.
[15:54] She is much worse than brother..
[15:57] Don’t say that.
[15:59] Now she’ll brainwash brother against Chanda now, you’ll see.
[16:05] Did you go to Chanda api?
[16:07] How is she?
[16:10] You wanted to bring her here right? She didn't come?
[16:37] Why are you eating food here?
[16:39] You will get me scolded by madam.
[16:41] Only masters get to eat food here, not servants.
[16:45] You’re a servant of this house now.
[16:47] Pick up your food and take it inside the kitchen.
[16:52] What are you looking at? Get going.
[16:56] Sure.
[17:06] Where did he go without telling me?
[17:09] I’ll call him, I have to tell him something important.
[17:16] Hello Babar, where did you go without informing me?
[17:20] I am out for some important work.
[17:21] I have to tell you something important..
[17:24] Whatever it is, tell me once I'm back home. I don't have time right now.
[17:33] He cut my call?
[17:36] And what about the important thing I have to tell him?
[17:39] Only God knows when he’ll be back. How will I be able to keep it in for so long..
[18:24] Quiet! Our respect?
[18:27] What about the shamelessness you were doing standing over there which I saw from my own eyes,
[19:00] I had gone to the state agent,
[19:03] I gave him the advance and the security.
[19:07] That’s good.
[19:13] What has happened to you?
[19:15] Nothing..
[19:19] Something has happened but anyways,
[19:21] what was that important matter you wanted to discuss for which you had called me for?
[19:26] Actually..
[19:31] What? Tell me.
[19:42] Mom!
[19:43] Babar…
[19:44] Mom!
[19:45] Babar, listen to me…
[19:46] Leave me! Why did you go to meet Chanda?
[19:49] Listen to me…
[19:50] Why did you go…? Quiet!
[19:51] Don’t speak in between now!
[19:53] You tell me.
[19:54] How many times have I told you that you aren’t supposed to meet Chanda?
[19:56] Why did you go? Why did you go! Respond to me!
[19:59] Don’t you understand anything?
[20:01] Do you know you’re the reason behind the destruction of this house?
[20:03] Only you!
[20:05] Dad also passed away because of you!
[20:07] But I always held myself back and never said it to you.
[20:11] I have saved this house from breaking!
[20:14] Why don’t you speak? Respond to me!
[20:16] What do you want? Do you want me to die like dad? Should I take my own life?
[20:21] Stop it, Bhai.
[20:23] Mom didn’t commit a sin.
[20:24] She only went to meet her daughter, that’s all!
[20:26] Babar: She isn’t anyone’s daughter!
[20:28] The girl who put our respect at stake and ran away, she isn’t anyone’s daughter!
[20:33] Really? Is running away and getting married that big of a sin?
[20:36] Then what did you do? What difference is there between you and Aapi?
[20:39] She ran away and got married and you made someone else run away and got married
[20:42] I will break your face!
[20:44] Enough!
[20:46] I’ve had enough!
[20:51] I will go to meet Chanda! She’s my daughter, I have all the rights!
[20:55] You can do whatever you like!
[20:58] Let him do whatever he wants to do.
[21:00] I would also like to see how much poison there is inside of him!
[21:04] You put a slap across my face for Chanda?
[21:09] I’m sick of hearing people talk!
[21:13] I won’t let all this happen in my dad’s house.
[21:17] That’s why you go with them. Go and live in Chanda’s house!
[21:21] We’ll go to her!
[21:23] But I cannot tolerate any more of this injustice with my children!
[21:36] What happened? I thought you guys were about to leave.
[21:39] Why haven’t you left yet?
[21:40] What do you want?
[21:42] What do you want… that I leave you at the door myself or that I push these two out of here?
[21:48] Because I am a bad person anyway.
[21:50] I will always be the bad guy in your eyes, no matter how much truth I speak. Right?
[21:55] Bhai, what has even happened to you? Why are you misbehaving so much with Mom?
[22:00] Leave him!
[22:00] Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
[22:02] Babar. Babar….
[22:02] I won’t see any more of you all’s shamelessness! Get out of here!
[22:03] Oh you, leave me!
[22:04] They’ll all go!
[22:28] Leave my way.
[22:30] Why’re you distancing yourself from me and torturing yourself?
[22:35] Who are you to ask me that question? What’s your worth?
[22:43] You’ll only see your Chanda when you remove the curtain of hatred.
[22:49] My Chanda is dead
[22:50] and now you’re just a maid of this house.
[22:53] My mom has kept you in the house, you should be grateful to her!
[22:59] What do you think of yourself?
[23:01] What do you think of yourself!
[23:02] I’ve been apologizing since so many days,
[23:05] listening to everybody’s tantrums, baring everything.
[23:08] Just so you get convinced and accept me.
[23:13] But you don’t even look towards me.
[23:16] Whatever happened was
[23:19] because of you and your parents! They’re the only ones to blame!
[23:24] I hate you. I hate you! Do you understand?
[23:28] I am the one who should hate you!
[23:31] Did you forget, yeah? Did you forget? Should I remind you? This.
[23:35] his was that place, right? You fought with me over here, right?
[23:38] My foot slipped and you killed my child!
[23:40] Because of you my child died. My child died!
[23:42] What do you want…
[23:43] Do you want to die?
[23:44] Yes, I want to die! Kill me with your hands!
[23:48] Strangle me!
[23:50] But I cannot tolerate this hatred of yours. Don’t hate me so much.
[23:53] Don’t hate me. Don’t hate me! I cannot tolerate your hatred!
[24:07] Where are you going? Listen to me!
[24:10] I can’t hate you. Don’t hate me. I can’t tolerate it. I can’t tolerate it….
[24:32] Hold on, I’m coming!
[24:35] One minute.
[24:45] Oh, Sitara?
[24:48] Sister in law, you?
[24:50] At this hour?
[24:52] Come, come. Come. Come, come.
[24:56] Come.
[25:03] Everything’s fine sister in law, right?
[25:07] Uncle, Bhai has kicked us out of the house.
[25:14] What?
[25:16] Babar did it?
[25:20] Is he out of his mind?
[25:25] Come with me. I’ll come and talk to him…
[25:27] No. There’s no need to talk.
[25:33] But my child…
[25:34] Sitara is right.
[25:44] That’s up to you but… alright, no worries.  Kids, you don’t have to get worried.
[25:50] This is also your own house.
[25:51] Come, come. Everything will be alright. Come, come. Come. Come, sister in law.
[25:55] It’s not an issue.
[25:56] Come, come. Come.
[25:58] Come, come. Come.
[26:41] Babar….
[26:46] Assalam o Alaikum, Wajid uncle.
[26:48] Walaikum a Salam, how are you?
[26:51] IT had been a lot of days so I thought of checking up on you guys. Where is Babar?
[26:55] Babar is here only but…. He’s really tense.
[26:58] And I cannot see him like this.
[27:02] He’s tensed? What… what happened?
[27:04] Wajid Sahib whatever’s happened is very bad.
[27:06] Mom went to Chanda’s house to meet her.
[27:09] Babar created a scene in this house when he found out about it.
[27:14] The fight got so worse that Babar kicked Mom, Zain and Sitara out of the house.
[27:20] What?
[27:21] Has he gone mad that he’s kicked her mom and sister out of the house?
[27:26] you don’t get worried. I’ll come. In fact, I’ll bring them home with me.
[27:30] How can he kick them out like that?
[27:31] No, no! You don’t come at this hour.
[27:34] Babar is very furious right now. You can come in the morning.
[27:37] Alright. I’ll come in the morning. Alright. Allah Hafiz.
[27:45] Has he gone mental or what? What does he keep doing?
[28:08] Sister in law, I just can’t believe
[28:12] that Babar could stoop this low.
[28:20] He has hurt a mother’s heart. He’ll never stay happy.
[28:26] Don’t say that.
[28:30] HE hasn’t hurt my heart.
[28:35] May Allah always keep him happy.
[28:42] I can understand, sister in law.
[28:45] No matter how bad a child does,
[28:49] his mother will always only pray for him.
[28:56] But what do I do, sister in law?
[28:59] I have seen you ruling that house and now....
[29:07] Now,
[29:09] I mean Bhai Sahib had kept you like a queen and your own son left you out on the streets?
[29:25] He took away the house, that too from his mom?
[29:29] Only Allah can have mercy.
[29:33] May Allah have mercy!
[29:37] But you don’t worry. I’ll do everything in my capacity.
[29:43] I’ll go and check the room. I’ll put a mattress for you guys.
[30:16] Aapi?
[30:18] When will I grow up?
[30:22] What’s the rush to grow up for?
[30:26] Because you look very nice with all the innocence.
[30:31] I want to grow up soon.
[30:33] So I can be your support and take revenge from Bhai.
[30:39] What is this that you’re saying?
[30:40] Bhai has done us very wrong. I feel like killing him!
[30:44] Don’t say such things again.
[30:48] Come on. Close your eyes and go to sleep.
[32:33] Son, have milk.
[32:36] No, mom. I don’t feel like having milk at all.
[32:38] Son, you will have to have milk if you don’t eat your breakfast properly, right?
[32:42] I am keeping it here.
[32:46] Where is Sitara?
[32:48] She just came to you.
[32:50] To me?
[33:03] Muraad, I can’t find Sitara.
[33:07] What are you saying, sister in law?
[33:09] Sitara is not some small girl who’ll get lost. She must be here somewhere.
[33:14] She isn’t here! I’ve checked the entire house. My heart keeps sinking!
[33:21] Zain! Sitara was with you, right?
[33:25] Yes. She was with me in the room only but she left from there a long time ago.
[33:29] Did she say something to you before leaving?
[33:30] No, no. She didn’t tell me anything. But she was very angry too.
[33:37] I think that she may have gone to Babar’s?
[33:43] Oh Allah! What trial is this?
[33:45] I’ll go see.
[33:46] No, no. I’ll go.
[33:47] Mom! Should I come with you?
[33:48] Son, you stay here with your uncle.
[33:52] I’ll just be back.
[33:54] Sister in law! Be careful.
[34:14] You didn’t do a nice thing, Babar!
[34:17] You didn’t do the right thing.
[34:18] I mean, why did you even let your mother and sister leave the house?
[34:23] Anyway, what’s done is done.
[34:24] You go and bring them back to their house.
[34:28] Tea.
[34:31] I’ll check.
[34:53] What have you come here for now?
[35:00] I’ve come to see how much peace you are in after taking away the house of a widowed mother.
[35:08] And I’ve also come to see
[35:10] if your life has gotten any better by leaving your orphan siblings out on the streets?
[35:15] After what you two have done with us, our lives haven’t been any easier either.
[35:23] The stain of disgrace and insult that you’ve given to me
[35:25] has left me hiding face from the world forever.
[35:29] And mom? What did she do?
[35:33] She has only cared for you guys.
[35:36] She doesn’t even care about my respect and honor.
[35:39] Wow!
[35:40] Kicking your widowed mother out of the house
[35:42] must have gotten your name some respect, right?
[35:44] Is your honor safe now, after leaving your young sister and innocent brother helpless?
[35:49] Sitara!
[35:51] Babar, keep your anger in control. Don’t worsen the matter!
[35:56] Do you see that?
[35:57] Do you see how her tongue works like a scissor?
[36:00] I won’t spare you, I’m telling you!
[36:02] Have you gone mad?
[36:03] What will you do?
[36:04] You want to kill me, strangle me? Do it.
[36:06] But remember one thing. Doing bad to us won’t do any good to you either!
[36:11] Sitara!
[36:12] I’ll break your face if you utter another word out of your mouth!
[36:17] There’s no need to respond to her. Leave it.
[36:18] Babar, she’s constantly speaking rubbish and you’re asking me to stay quiet?
[36:22] I told you to stay quiet, right!
[36:24] What is this that you guys are doing? And why?
[36:27] She’s your real sister, not some stranger. And look at her condition.
[36:31] She’s gotten completely weak because of all the crying.
[36:32] Have some empathy at least.
[36:35] The way she’s uttering poison for me…
[36:38] she just can’t be my sister.
[36:40] And you listen to me, Sitara.
[36:43] The way Chanda died for me, you have too.
[36:49] Now get out of my house before I end up doing something wrong.
