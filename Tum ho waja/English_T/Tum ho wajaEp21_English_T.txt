[00:42] The way Chanda died for me, you have too.
[00:50] Now get out of my house before I end up doing something wrong.
[01:11] I could have never imagined that I would be alive to see this day.
[01:20] After Mansoor left I had thought that my children would become my support.
[01:29] I have realised today that I am unsupported.
[01:39] But I still pray
[01:42] and hope that your children never treat you the way you have treated your mother,
[01:50] that  your children don’t abandon you the way you have abandoned your own siblings.
[02:00] Let;s go, I feel suffocated here.
[02:06] Babar..
[02:12] You are not in the condition to think rationally right now,
[02:15] cool down your mind.
[02:18] I’ll come some other time.
[02:35] Listen..
[02:36] What has happened?
[02:39] She is here..
[02:40] Who has come, tell me?
[02:42] Sana is here.
[02:46] Sana?
[02:48] Let’s go already..
[03:09] You.
[03:13] Why have you come here?
[03:19] What is it to you?
[03:20] What is it to me?
[03:23] Understand something very clearly, if you have come here to marry Shahab then..
[03:27] Go work in kitchen. Go go..
[03:40] Hello uncle. How are you?
[03:43] Hello..
[03:43] Hi aunty. Hope all’s well.
[03:48] Sana, why you come?
[03:51] Well,I have come here to let you guys know that I have made my decision.
[03:57] I have decided..
[04:01] Decision? What kind of decision dear?
[04:06] That I want to marry Sahab.
[04:10] I want to get married but within this week..
[04:14] Ikram..
[04:16] Oh please uncle,  don't worry about dad.
[04:19] I have discussed everything with him.
[04:20] You guys just decide the date then.
[04:24] Very good..
Very good..
[04:27] Everything else is taken care of.
[04:31] You sit. Tea, coffee, toffee..
[04:33] No uncle,  I should get going.
[04:35] But I see you guys soon right? Bye!
[04:50] inside girl! Go go! Bye..
[04:54] Bye..
[04:59] Bye..
[05:03] What were you talking about?
[05:05] What were you asking her?
[05:07] I had asked you not to say anything.
[05:10] Do you not understand English?
[05:12] Go inside! Go!
[05:21] How are you?
[05:31] Look at what brother did to us?
[05:34] And you blessed him with your prayers?
[05:37] How could I have cursed him? He’s my son.
[05:40] Then what are we to you?
[05:42] You care about the son who threw you out of the house
[05:44] and the daughter who ran away from the house
[05:46] but you don’t care about us, me and Zain?
[05:52] All my children are equal for me.
[05:54] If we are equal then why don't you think about us?
[05:57] Brother and his two faced of a wife are having fun at home
[06:00] and we are wandering door to door.
[06:02] How is that fair?
[06:03] Then what do I do?
[06:08] That house is in your name.
[06:13] So?
[06:13] So tell brother that house is yours, he can take his wife wherever he wants to.
[06:19] So I should evict him?
[06:20] Yes, you should evict him.
[06:21] if he doesn't care about you then he also has no right to stay in that house mom.
[06:28] Since when did you start talking big?
[06:30] I will absolutely not do that.
[06:35] Mom, we all have a right to that house.
[06:38] . If anybody has an issue they can make arrangements for themselves.
[06:42] Why should we wander around..
[06:44] Sitara is absolutely right.
[06:52] That house only isn’t Babar’s, these children also have the right to it.
[06:59] How can you deprive them of their right?
[07:05] How can I let my family scatter over such a small matter
[07:12] You think this is a small matter mom?
[07:15] He has acted arbitrarily after dad left,
[07:18] he even threw us out of the house.
[07:21] Our family isn’t a family anymore, it has scattered away.
[07:24] All there is left is the structure of a house on which we all have a right on.
[07:32] Whatever it may be,
[07:35] he is my son after all. How can I do that to him?
[07:38] Am I not your son?
[07:47] Zain, what are you talking about?
[07:51] Of course you’re my son.
[07:53] How could you think like that?
[07:57] Oh my, look who's all grown up.
[08:01] Now is your chance, don’t let this opportunity pass Muraad.
[08:08] Look, I’m not in the favor of allotment,
[08:15] not at all but these children shouldn’t be deprived of their right.
[08:25] The rest is up to you.
[08:31] God bless you.
[09:16] what are you thinking about?
[09:19] Here, have tea..
[09:23] What has happened?
[09:27] Nothing..
[09:31] There was a thought wandering in my mind,
[09:38] that how must an orphan’s life be like..
[09:44] Babar, why are you saying such things?
[09:52] You have also lived such a life.
[09:57] What does it feel like?
[10:00] I want to know..
[10:04] What do I tell you..
[10:07] I was very young when my father passed away
[10:11] then my mother gave me the love of both father and a mother,
[10:15] when I became a teenager my mother also passed away
[10:20] after that my life became a curse.
[10:27] If mom would have been alive today then
[10:30] I wouldn’t have been wandering door to door.
[10:34] Even if my wedding wouldn’t have been a grand event but
[10:39] there would still have been henna on my hands.
[10:44] Even today I feel mom’s absence..
[10:53] Look at me, I’m so unfortunate.
[10:59] so unfortunate that my mother is alive
[11:09] but I deprived myself from her shadow.
[11:17] Babar, why do you blame yourself?
[11:21] Because I am to be blamed.
[11:28] What I did was very wrong, I misbehaved with them.
[11:32] I should have apologized but I..
[11:35] Nothing will get fixed if you apologize in fact it will get much worse.
[11:42] Today Sitara talked back to you.
[11:44] Tomorrow, Chanda might also come and start questioning you.
[11:50] It’s good,
[11:51] I agree that you've realised your mistake but remember that it takes two to tango.
[12:00] Some might find it right and some might find it wrong
[12:03] but I think whatever you did was absolutely right.
[12:10] But they’re all alone..
[12:14] How can I let them stay somewhere else..
[12:18] Babar, when did I ask you to leave them?
[12:22] All I am asking is for you to be patient for a few days.
[12:32] After your father you are the householder of this house,
[12:37] you are our guardian.
[12:40] Mom, Zain, Sitara and Chanda,
[12:44] it’s everyone’s duty to listen to you and abide by it as well.
[12:49] If that doesn't happen then no one will respect you.
[12:55] Today, Sitara talked back to you,
[12:58] , If this keeps going on
[13:02] then Zain will also stand against you and say whatever he feels like.
[13:07] Babar, I am saying all this because I want what's better for this family,
[13:11] , I want to maintain your respect and I am with you.
[13:28] I think it's Danish calling..
[13:33] Hello?
[13:34] Yes dad, can you hear me?
[13:37] Yes Danish! Can you hear me?
[13:40] Asalam o alikum.
[13:41] Walikum Asalam. How are you?
[13:44] I am absolutely fine dad. How are you?
[13:47] I am doing good by the grace of God. You told me that you’ll call once you’ll reach.
[13:51] Sorry dad I got a little busy that's why I couldn't call but I did leave you a message.
[13:57] I was just worried about you..
[14:00] Tell me how is aunty doing?
[14:07] Did Sitara not call you?
[14:09] No? Is everything okay?
[14:12] What do I tell you Danish..
[14:15] Babar has thrown everyone out of the house.
[14:20] Okay..
[14:21] And now everyone is here with me.
[14:26] I don't know what has happened to Babar brother,
[14:29] he has become an enemy to his own family.
[14:31] What do I say son..  I am doing whatever I can.
[14:37] Dad please take good care of aunty, Zain and Sitara and make them feel at home.
[14:46] I'll try my best son.
[14:48] Danish, you know that besides God you are the only support I have.
[14:53] I used to manage somehow when I was alone
[14:59] but now I have guests at home..
[15:01] Don't worry dad, everything will be fine.
[15:05] Inshallah. Khuda hafiz.
[15:07] Make sure to call me.
[15:08] Alright dad, Khuda hafiz.
[15:11] Khuda hafiz.
[15:15] Thank God, Danish reached Dubai.
[15:28] What do you want? What do you want… that I leave you at the door myself or
[15:33] that I push these two out of here?
[15:35] Because I am a bad person anyway.
[15:37] I will always be the bad guy in your eyes, no matter how much truth I speak.
[15:42] Mom, we all have a right to that house.
[15:46] If anybody has an issue they can make arrangements for themselves.
[15:49] Why should we wander around..
[15:55] All my children scattered away.
[15:58] My family got destroyed, everything got destroyed.
[16:03] I never caused anyone any harm intentionally,
[16:08] never wished anything bad upon anyone
[16:10] then why did this happen to me?
[16:14] Then why am I living in somebody else’s home?
[16:19] If I’ve made a mistake unintentionally then forgive me God.
[16:26] Oh god, show me a way..
[16:29] I’ll have to be strong.
[16:33] I can’t give up so easily
[16:36] otherwise what will become of these two?
[16:43] Oh God, help me..
[17:05] Why did you go?
[17:08] You were the only one who I could share everything with.
[17:15] . I have become all alone without you.
[17:19] Come back.
[17:22] Please.
[17:24] Come back soon..
[17:41] Shahab, I hope you understand that this is a very big decision for me
[17:46] in fact papa is very unsure and I..
[17:56] Shahab?
[17:59] I hope you’re not doing all this to take revenge from Chanda?
[18:05] Sana, nobody is forcing you
[18:08] and I can’t give answers to so many questions.
[18:11] Now you know the situation, the rest is up to you.
[18:15] Congratulations! Congratulations!
[18:21] Have some sweet, come on..
[18:24] Ghafoor and Ikram have fixed your marriage, the date has been decided.
[18:28] The engagement is tomorrow and the marriage ceremony is the day after tomorrow.
[18:31] You should go and buy a nice dress now. Take her shopping.
[18:43] Why are you standing like that Shahab? Have some sweets..
[18:46] Aunty,
[18:49] I’ll make Shahab eat it.
[18:55] Shahab..
[18:57] Here you go, have some sweets.
[18:59] Eat it! Shameem! Shameem!
[19:03] Come on..
[19:12] Aunty is right. We must go for shopping now. Yeah?
[19:17] Let’s go! What are you waiting for?
[19:39] What are you doing, Murad?
[19:44] Actually sister in law… I was just checking the ration.
[19:50] Everything Is finished.
[19:53] . I used to live alone before. I used to go to sleep hungry too sometimes.
[19:59] Now the kids are over, that’s why I was getting worried.
[20:03] Take this.
[20:05] Whatever ration you can buy from this, get it.
[20:07] Oh! No, no, sister in law. I can’t take this. I can’t take this at any cost.
[20:11] Keep it. The kids won’t find out.
[20:14] Go and get the ration.
[20:19] You’ve provided a roof over our heads.
[20:23] Is this favor of yours any less?
[20:29] No, sister in law. How is this a favor? This is your own house.
[20:35] I’ll go get the ration.
[20:44] Mom!
[20:51] How long is this going to go on for?
[20:53] What are you trying to say?
[20:54] I heard everything.
[20:57] Why don’t you talk to Bhai? He’s sitting peacefully over there!
[21:01] And we’re depending on uncles’ favors.
[21:05] Have you thought of a permanent solution for this?
[21:13] You don’t worry. In Sha Allah, everything will be fine.
[21:16] Whose help are you waiting for?
[21:24] : I have full faith in my blood.
[21:28] You’ll see.
[21:30] Babar will come and take us home very soon.
[21:40] You’re mistaken.
[21:44] You have forgotten that before being your son, he’s somebody else’s husband now.
[21:51] He won’t ever come here while she’s there.
[22:19] Babar!
[22:21] Oh.
[22:26] Wake up, I’m serving the food. Come.
[22:29] Wait. I don’t want to eat. I don’t feel like it.
[22:32] . I’ve been sitting at home since so many days… I’m sick of it.
[22:36] I can’t figure out anything about work and business
[22:39] and there’s still twenty more days till I get the keys to the shop.
[22:45] Alright. Get up and sit.
[22:52] Will all the worries go away if you don’t get up and don’t eat food?
[22:59] What else am I supposed to do other than staying upset?
[23:03] I thought I would call Umer and maybe he can help me out.
[23:07] So then what did he say?
[23:08] What would he say?
[23:10] He didn’t hear my calls.
[23:12] In fact, he didn’t even respond to my messages.
[23:16] What have you gotten yourself into?
[23:19] Just directly call Wajid Uncle.
[23:21] Didn’t he say that he would help you?
[23:24] I am thinking about it. I don’t have any other option except for Wajid Sahib.
[23:28] Erum! What happened? What happened? Sit!
[23:33] Nothing. It’s just…. I got a little dizzy all of a sudden.
[23:36] Dizzy? You’re facing weakness! You haven’t even eaten anything….
[23:39] I hope you aren’t stressing about my work, right?
[23:41] Don’t worry. I am fine.
[23:45] You just be fine. I… I really need your support right now.
[23:49] Why are you getting worried? I am telling you, right?
[23:59] Oh yes! This is what a grand wedding looks like!
[24:00] This is what the set up should look like
[24:02] I just want the lights to be hung over here….
[24:04] Yes, get them hung over here.
[24:05] Yes!
[24:05] And it’ll look beautiful once the flowers are also put.
[24:08] I just want it to look nice.
[24:10] I want everyone to see that it’s my Shebi’s wedding!
[24:28] What is it? You’ve kept the tea, right?
[24:30] Why are you standing over our heads now? Go!
[24:34] I want to talk to the both of you.
[24:39] Say it. What do you have to talk about?
[24:42] Please don’t do this. Why are you doing this?
[24:49] What are you talking about?
[24:53] Don’t get Shahab married to that girl!
[24:56] Why are you also torturing your son by getting this marriage done?
[24:59] I know that he isn’t happy with this marriage!
[25:01] Oh you, quiet!
[25:03] You cheap girl,
[25:05] you’re standing in front of us and telling us what we should or shouldn’t do for our son?
[25:08] Who even are you? What is your worth?
[25:11] That we should ask you before making decisions for our son’s life?
[25:14] You… You told me, right? Didn’t you tell me? You can make me swear upon anything
[25:20] I’m ready to do everything!
[25:22] You two wanted for me to never go to my home, right?
[25:24] You wanted me to never meet my family, right?
[25:26] ? I won’t! I won’t even think about them!
[25:28] But you please don’t get this marriage done! Please!
[25:31] Nobody is going to get any good out of this marriage!
[25:33] For god sake!
[25:33] Get your hands off! Get your hands off!
[25:35] tell her to go away from here before I lose my cool! Get her out! Get out!
[25:39] Shahab is only mine. He loves me! Have mercy on me. For god sake!
[25:43] Why don’t you leave! Go!
[25:45] Shameem! Take her away!
[25:50] Don’t let this marriage take place!
[25:55] Leave already, slow motion!
[25:58] She has come after my life!
[26:02] She’s ruined the taste of my tea!
[26:05] Yes so, what were you showing me?
[26:08] She ruined the entire mood!
[26:18] Assalam o Alaikum, uncle.
[26:24] How are you, uncle?
[26:26] You tell me!
[26:28] Are you happy after kicking your mom out of the house?
[26:33] Uncle, I said it out of anger but she actually left.
[26:35] Really? She left?
[26:38] You keep insulting your mom on every little thing,
[26:41] raise your hands on your siblings.
[26:43] What else could she have done if not this? Tell me!
[26:45] You know it very well that what she did was wrong.
[26:47] Yes! I know it quite well!
[26:50] But you have forgotten one thing, Babar.
[26:53] That Chanda is also sister in law’s daughter. I admit that she has made a mistake
[26:56] but that doesn’t mean that we cut all ties with her!
[26:59] You made the same mistake too.
[27:01] Should we have also done the same treatment with you?
[27:05] I am very upset that instead of handling your responsibilities properly after Bhai Sahib’s passing,
[27:09] you have destroyed that house!
[27:10] Uncle, what would you have done if you were in my place?
[27:12] God forbid that I’m ever in your place!
[27:17] Don’t say that. I am your nephew, your blood!
[27:19] Enough, enough! Enough!
[27:22] How could you be someone else’s when you couldn’t be your own mothers?
[27:26] Go! Get out of here! And stay happy in your life. Go! Go! Go!
[27:37] You raised your hand on my son?
[27:41] You wait and watch what I do to you, Babar!
[27:47] How will I be able to live over here if you keep crying like this, Sitara?
[27:54] I waited so much.
[27:57] My heart was so full! Thank god you called.
[28:02] Stay strong, Sitara.
[28:04] You’re the only one who can stand as a support for Tayi Jaan.
[28:07] I need you.
[28:11] Leave Dubai, please come back here. Please!
[28:15] If my plan for coming here was irrelevant, I would’ve come back.
[28:19] But I have to earn loads of money for you, myself and for everyone, Sitara.
[28:24] What’s the point of earning such money
[28:27] that keeps you separated from your loved ones?
[28:30] Given the circumstances, money is our biggest need right now.
[28:34] Alright. You stay over there and earn lots of money.
[28:40] But remember, what if the wealth that you have gone to earn,
[28:45] separates you from your loved ones only?
[28:48] What are you saying, Sitara?
[28:51] I don’t want to talk to you anymore.
[28:54] Take care of yourself. Allah Hafiz.
[28:58] Hello? Sitara?
[29:21] Erum!
[29:24] Erum!
[29:27] Where were you!
[29:29] I told you that you aren’t feeling well and that you shouldn’t get out of the bed, right?
[29:32] Come on, come! I’ll get you juice…
[29:33] Babar. I have to tell you something.
[29:37] Yes, go ahead. Everything’s fine, right?
[29:41] A guest is about to come.
[29:43] Who? Is Wajid Sahib coming?
[29:46] No.
[29:49] : Is it Umer? Maybe he wants to resolve the matter after the fight.
[29:56] Someone who’s your own. Someone very close.
[30:00] Erum, what riddles are you making me solve?
[30:02] Tell me who is coming, fast.
[30:03] So I can make the arrangements accordingly.
[30:07] You are about to become a father
[30:09] Alright. Then you could’ve told me this before so I….
[30:15] What?
[30:17] Me?
[30:19] What? One minute. One minute.
[30:22] You’re about to become a mother?
[30:26] You can’t give me better news than this, Erum!
[30:30] I’ll go tell mom right now. She’ll be so happy…
[30:47] Listen, come you. Come and have your juice. Come.
[30:58] Yes, Zain. Are you studying?
[31:01] Uncle, you teach me English today.
[31:05] But I don’t know English.
[31:07] Why not?
[31:10] Because we have only wasted time in school. In playing.
[31:16] I never concentrated on my studies.
[31:18] So that means that you are also a bad kid.
[31:21] Haven’t you started talking too much these days?
[31:26] Learn what I have told you to learn!
[31:28] Uncle, look! She’s always scolding me.
[31:32] Look, Sitara.  You don’t have to scold my lion son after today! Okay?
[31:40] Sitara, clean this ASAP. I have to start cooking.
[31:43] All of it?
[31:44] I met Babar today.
[31:51] I have asked you to do something! Clean it ASAP, I have to start cooking. Go.
[32:13] I hope your children never treat you the way you have treated your mother.
[32:17] I pray your children don’t abandon you the way you have abandoned your own siblings.
[32:23] Babar!
[32:26] What has happened to you? You seem tense.
[32:30] I don’t know. I… I feel restless.
[32:35] It feels like there’s something incomplete in this house.
[32:39] I miss mom a lot.
[32:43] . I don’t feel like doing anything without her.
[32:45] And when I think about her,
[32:48] , I think of the time when I insulted and kicked her out of the house.
[32:52] I am going to bring her back!
[32:53] Babar, at least hear me out…
[32:54] You just tell me…
[32:57] You should also come with me. You will come, right?
[32:59] What can I say?
[33:00] What do you mean what can you say? Will you come with me or not!
[33:04] Yes, Babar. I will come with you. I’ll come.
[33:08] You should come!
[33:09] Yes.
[33:10] You should come anyway. Alright. Come.
[33:38] What are you doing here? Move!
[33:45] She’s my wife.
[33:47] Don’t touch her!
[33:49] What can you do!
[33:50] Babar! Babar!
[33:51] Didn’t I ask you not touch her! She’s my wife. I am telling you….
[33:55] I am making you understanding. Go back! Move away!
[34:01] Babar! Babar! Babar!
[34:03] Come here! Come!

[36:39] Wow!
[36:41] There is a charge of attempt to murder on him!
[36:45] And you’re saying he’s innocent?
[36:47] This is a false allegation!
[36:49] He was only trying to protect himself.
[36:51] Someone was trying to kidnap our daughter in law…
[36:55] There is a missing report filed in this police station of the girl
[36:59] that you’re calling your daughter in law.
[37:01] You let my son go.
