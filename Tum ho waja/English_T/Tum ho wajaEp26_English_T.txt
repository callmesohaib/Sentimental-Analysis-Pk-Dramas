[01:07] Thank god it was a dream..
[02:00] Let’s go inside.. You should rest.. You have such a high fever. Let’s go inside, come..
[02:12] It’ll be fine..
[02:30] You’re upset with me right?
[02:43] Dad was also upset with me.. I couldn’t conciliate him.. I am so unfortunate, so unlucky..
[02:57] You aren’t the one who is unfortunate,
[02:59] it was dad who was unfortunate.
[03:03] The person he loved all his life,
[03:12] took his life away.
[03:14] Mom, he has left because of me right?
[03:16] Be quiet.
[03:20] For the love of God Sitara, please be quiet.
[03:30] Sorry..
[03:35] Chanda, you haven’t eaten anything since yesterday. Here, have breakfast.
[03:44] Eat it please..
[03:48] Okay if you don’t want to eat this then let’s go one thing, have a little fruit.
[03:55] Eat it.. please eat it..
[04:01] Okay if you don’t want to eat fruit then drink this juice.
[04:07] You can at least drink juice.. Here, hold it.. Chanda?
[04:15] Chanda!
[04:18] Drink the juice.
[04:20] Chanda, what is your problem? Please eat something.
[04:24] Chanda please.. Please eat! I’ll see how you won’t anything..
[04:30] Shahab.. Shahab..
[04:32] Mama, look at her.. she isn’t eating anything
[04:34] What is this way of making someone eat food? If you want to make her eat, then do it with love.
[04:46] Chanda, eat something..
[04:52] Till when you will keep crying like this?
[04:55] This will stay with you all your life now.
[04:58] The people who have left don’t come back by crying. Good girl, be strong..
[05:09] Chanda..
[05:11] Look at what is happening to her please.. She hasn’t eaten anything since yesterday..
[05:18] Shahab, don’t worry. She has lost her father, it will take time..
[05:24] I am very worried. Please go and check on her, please..
[05:28] Okay..
[05:58] Dad came in my dream..
[06:01] Babar..
[06:07] I didn’t fight with your father..
[06:14] Let it be mom, there’s no point of this discussion.
[06:18] Wait.
[06:21] Look at me,
[06:25] have you ever seen me raising my voice with your father?
[06:30] He was a heart patient, I used to stay scared about him taking tension of..
[06:38] Knowing that, you used to still meet Chanda.
[06:42] Chanda was dad’s dearest right?
[06:46] Dad loved Chanda the most from out of us four
[06:52] but he still stopped meeting Chanda.
[07:00] Do you know why?
[07:03] Because he was disrespected, his confidence and trust had been broken.
[07:12] All he could hear was that, ‘Mansoor Ahmed’s daughter has run away, run away’!
[07:21] How can a person survive in such a torture mom?
[07:25] And dad also couldn’t stay alive,
[07:29] he died when he shouldn’t have died! He had to stay alive for you, for us!
[07:41] He had to witness our happy moments and what did you do?
[07:47] You used to keep going to meet Chanda.
[07:50] We told you a thousand times not to meet her but did you listen to me? Did you listen to dad?
[08:02] I was helpless in front of my love for my daughter..
[08:05] And a husband’s love?
[08:08] You couldn’t remember a husband’s love?
[08:11] A husband’s respect, a husband’s pride, he had no value for you right?
[08:15] It’s not like that..
[08:16] It is like that!
[08:19] And stop it please, don’t do this drama because I saw it with my own eyes
[08:26] when you were sitting and talking to Chanda at uncle’s house.
[08:31] What did you think? Should I tell you? Because you won’t say anything right now.
[08:40] You thought all these things will stay hidden, dad will never find out and when he found out
[08:45] and when he asked you then you argued with him,
[08:49] you forced him to go to Chanda’s in-laws and ask for forgiveness
[08:53] and when he refused so you misbehaved with him on which he tried to raise his hand on you!
[08:57] Muraad raised his hand not him..
[09:00] Lie!
[09:02] You are lying! Stop it! Don’t lie!
[09:07] You aren’t believing on what your mother is saying?
[09:11] I don’t believe on anything you have to say now.
[09:18] I won’t spare Muraad for what he has done to my family.
[09:23] Really?
[09:27] Then listen to me mom,
[09:32] dad is no more because of you
[09:39] and uncle holds that place for me now
[09:44] and if you try to cause any harm to uncle also
[09:50] then you will lose this son of yours
[09:55] but with that this son of yours will stand in front of uncle like a shield. Remember that..
[11:09] Hello?
[11:10] Where are you?
[11:12] You were sleeping so I came to aunty’s.
[11:15] You could have at least waited for me to wake up.
[11:19] You can come here now..
[11:21] Yes, I’ll come. Tell me, how is the situation there?
[11:29] Everything is fine dad.
[11:34] I know.. you are my son, my child.
[11:39] You will present the bad also in a good way but I am asking about your aunty.
[11:47] Dad, she’s totally normal.
[11:51] Normal?
[11:53] What do you mean by normal?
[11:55] I mean to say, she is sad but it’s nothing like what you said.
[12:00] I was talking about the mad behavior, god knows what all she was saying at that time.
[12:07] Dad, do one thing, you come and take a look yourself.
[12:10] Okay I’m coming, you take care of everyone. Good boy.
[12:20] This woman should have created a scene by now, how come she is so normal?
[12:57] Go away from here. Leave me alone.
[13:08] I can’t..
[13:12] I’m worried about you..
[13:23] You’re worried?
[13:32] That is why you raised your hand.
[13:43] Will you punish me for this for the rest of our lives now?
[13:50] What you did to me wasn’t right.
[13:56] I was compelled to, and it was for the betterment of our child.
[14:09] The child who hasn’t even arrived in this world yet, his betterment..
[14:16] He is my life.
[14:29] And me?
[14:36] Chanda please..
[14:39] Try to understand what I’m saying,
[14:43] understand my helplessness..
[14:48] I know whatever I did was wrong, I am wrong..
[14:58] Your dad left and I couldn’t take you..
[15:02] If I would have taken you then the doors of this house for you would have gotten closed forever.
[15:17] I would have never been able to get you and my child the same respect and dignity,
[15:27] which is your right.
[15:41] I am not bad of a person..
[15:45] Will you take me to the graveyard?
[15:57] You know the answer to this question right?
[16:11] You can at least take me to uncle’s house..
[16:23] On one condition,
[16:27] you will eat something first,
[16:30] you will fix your appearance
[16:34] and behave normally in front of mama and dad
[16:43] then I’ll do something about this..
[17:18] You took his love and kindness for granted..
[17:22] Sitara, I am sad and I also feel anger towards myself.
[17:25] I had never thought hell will come and go because of the one thing that I did
[17:29] It must have passed for you, it will be hell for me till my very last breath
[17:37] Sitara, forgive me..
[17:39] My dad didn’t forgive me,
[17:42] he left.. he closed his eyes, he left us forever..
[17:48] How can I forgive you when I can’t even forgive myself?
[17:53] Sitara I know what you’re going through..
[17:56] I’m in such a bad condition myself and you’re his daughter after all.
[18:01] Uncle fell weak after the whole Chanda incident and on top of that my SMS, he just got angry.
[18:10] Angry?
[18:12] What you’re seeing as anger was torture,
[18:16] the torture of witnessing the second daughter’s betrayal after experiencing the betrayal of the first one.
[18:22] I wish that wouldn’t have happened and if uncle had been here today
[18:25] then you would have seen me begging for forgiveness
[18:30] and also asking him your hand in marriage. He would have blessed us and with love…
[18:35] Love! My love has been snatched!
[18:38] You have snatched my love from me!
[18:42] What are you trying to say by mentioning this, that I forget everything and start loving you?
[18:47] So do you not love me?
[18:50] Even if I ever did, I don’t anymore!
[18:53] Sitara, don’t say that. I’ll die.
[18:56] I am the one who should die. I should die now.
[19:01] I can’t bare dad being upset with me.
[19:05] I pray that Allah calls me to himself so I ask for forgiveness from my dad.
[19:12] What do you think, that Mansoor didn’t forgive you? That he was upset with you?
[19:20] Aunt…
[19:21] What you said is right.
[19:25] He really loved you. He used to trust you.
[19:33] This was just temporary madness.
[19:35] No, mom. When I went to him to apologize at night, he left…
[19:40] He left. Right?
[19:43] We were both up for a while after you left.
[19:48] He was saying that he would soon speak to Muraad and Danish
[19:52] and ask them to fix the date as soon as possible and take Sitara.
[19:58] He was saying that there can’t be a better match for my Sitara than Danish.
[20:05] Are you telling the truth?
[20:10] I wish he was alive
[20:14] and this thing would’ve turned true this evening.
[20:19] I wouldn’t have been the one to tell this then.
[20:28] Don’t live with any sort of misunderstanding. He wasn’t upset with you.
[20:33] Mom!
[20:35] Mom… We can never see him now. We can never hear his voice!
[20:43] Sitara, we can see him in ourselves. Happy, smiling. We can hear him!
[21:21] I had to yet learn to live life but you left?
[21:28] It’s becoming difficult for me to look after everything.
[21:32] Even then, I will try to live life the way you told me to.
[21:56] I pray that Allah calls me to himself so I ask for forgiveness from my dad.
[22:04] Forgive me, Mansoor.
[22:09] She was praying for her death
[22:12] so she could meet you once in the heavens above and ask for forgiveness.
[22:16] My heart was in my fist so I lied to her and told her you weren’t upset with her.
[22:24] She cried as if all her worries had gone away.
[22:29] One lie brought peace to my daughter, while the other has left my son to become restless.
[22:35] He’s upset with me. He doesn’t want to hear that his uncle….
[22:41] Maybe he’s telling the truth only. I took your life from you.
[22:48] I won’t say anything now. I will keep quiet. I can’t lose my son.
[22:57] A mother may lose in this battle of life but a mother’s love can’t.
[23:16] I will have to stay present in front of them
[23:20] otherwise God knows what rubbish she’s going to brainwash the children’s minds with.
[23:24] What if they turn against me?
[23:39] Uncle, dad!
[23:44] Stop it, my child. Enough.
[23:47] Enough.
[24:02] Missis!
[24:05] Oh my one and only Missis!
[24:09] You took a lot of time in coming home!
[24:12] Oh, what should I do? This…
[24:17] Move.
[24:18] These people are of no use now. Their issues keep increasing.
[24:23] Shake hands with them, hug them and talk to them too.
[24:29] Politics isn’t easy! You have to lose your mind…
[24:33] Shebi! Shebi!
[24:36] He isn’t home.
[24:38] Where is he gone?
[24:40] He’s taken Chanda to the hospital!
[24:43] Why didn’t you go with them?
[24:44] My foot! He has spoiled her! I feel like banging that  head on the wall!
[24:56] Has she broken her fast yet?
[24:59] Madam also had her breakfast in the room
[25:02] and the one who took the breakfast there was your favorite!
[25:12] They haven’t gone to the hospital…
[25:16] They must’ve gone to the hospital only. Where else would they go?
[25:23] You don’t know politics!
[25:46] I hate you! Go away from here!
[25:50] Chanda is dead for us!
[25:51] The voice that says that
[25:54] Mansoor Ahmed’s daughter has run away keeps echoing inside my head all the time!
[25:56] I pray that Allah calls me to himself so I ask for forgiveness from my dad.
[26:03] Mom!
[26:04] Mom! What are you doing!
[26:06] I was fixing my room. I told you that I would do this, right?
[26:10] Why are you so stubborn? You don’t listen to me!
[26:17] Uncle, why dad! Why!
[26:20] Enough, my child.
[26:23] His time had come. Don’t cry. Pray for your father.
[26:32] I was going to the graveyard only but you guys came over all of a sudden.
[26:41] Actually, Chanda had to meet you that’s why…
[26:44] You did a very nice thing, my son. The fact that you brought my daughter here, to me.
[26:55] Uncle!
[26:57] Uncle, you could’ve come, right?
[26:59] You could’ve taken me. Why didn’t you come, uncle? You should’ve come!
[27:04] How could I have come, my child?
[27:07] Hell had broken lose on us. I couldn’t understand anything!
[27:13] But uncle, how did all of this happen so suddenly?
[27:18] It didn’t happen all of a sudden, my child. All of this didn’t happen all of a sudden.
[27:24] What do I tell you?
[27:26] Bhai Sahib was very happy
[27:29] when he found out that his daughter’s in laws had finally accepted her. He was very happy!
[27:34] He instantly said that he would go to your parents and apologize to them
[27:41] and fix everything. But no. The same thing happened again.
[27:50] Sister in law small ego and stubbornness!
[27:56] I don’t understand, what does she want after all?
[28:01] Shebi, son. The truth is that my brother left this world with the hope to see his children happy.
[28:15] But what’s sad is the fact that you guys too, didn’t come to his funeral.
[28:27] And you know about Babar. The extent to which sister in law has filled hatred in his heart.
[28:36] Bhai Sahib kept witnessing drama throughout his life
[28:40] but I didn’t want for that drama to follow his funeral too.
[29:05] Sitara. Sit over here.
[29:17] I know that this is a very difficult time that has come on us.
[29:22] We had never thought that dad would leave us like this all of a sudden.
[29:37] But I wanted to tell you that
[29:44] you shouldn’t think that you’re left alone.
[29:48] If there’s any worry in your heart or if you want to talk about anything, you can share it with me.
[30:01] If dad isn’t here, it doesn’t mean that you have become an orphan.
[30:16] I am not just your elder brother now but also your father.
[30:31] That’s why if you have any problems or if you wish to talk about anything, you can with me.
[30:46] I am your support, your shadow.
[30:56] How can you become my support without giving any of it to mom?
[31:05] When did I say that I won’t be her shadow?
[31:09] You didn’t say it. But your attitude tells everything. Why are you doing this?
[31:22] Why are you upset with mom? And that also in a time where she needs you more than any of us.
[31:35] But I didn’t say anything like that, Sitara.
[31:38] I felt it.
[31:45] You’re getting worried for nothing.
[31:47] This is something be worried about, Bhai.
[31:52] I can’t see mom like this. She’s so unwell. She fainted in the morning too.
[32:01] She was crying so much. It took me a while to get her to stop. How do I take care of her?
[32:18] It’s nothing. There’s nothing like that. You’re thinking wrong.
[32:22] Give her your support. Mom needs you.
[32:27] We’ve lost dad, I don’t want to lose mom now. Please. Please, Bhai.
[32:33] Sitara, we won’t lose her. Don’t worry, it won’t happen. I will look after mom.
[32:50] One minute. One minute. Stop.
[32:56] What happened?
[33:02] My house is only at a little distance.
[33:05] Let’s go home?
[33:06] Chanda, we won’t go over there.
[33:08] I promise we’ll be back soon.
[33:09] We have no ties with that house now!
[33:13] Your dad, who was your pride has left this world. It’ll be better if you understand this!
[33:17] Sitara and Zain are there too, right?
[33:18] But there’s mom and bhai over there to take care of them.
[33:20] But…
[33:20] No buts now, Chanda!
[33:22] Chanda, we won’t go over to that house now and that’s it! Enough!
[33:45] Mom…
[34:08] Mom…
[34:21] I went to the graveyard.
[34:30] I got the whole grave covered with cloth.
[34:42] Babar.
[34:45] Don’t cry.
[34:50] Pray for your dad. You… you are my brave son.
[34:57] I am not brave.
[35:01] I am not brave, I am a very bad son! If I think about it,
[35:08] I think about the fact that I never listened to anything that dad said.
[35:17] He kept saying stuff to me and passed away.
[35:21] He kept saying to me that I should complete my studies but no! I didn’t listen to him.
[35:27] And you! I misbehaved so much with you.
[35:37] I can’t make sense of anything!
[35:42] If I hear the things uncle tells me, my blood starts to boil.
[35:49] And when I see you, my heart tells me that I should believe you.
[35:56] I am going crazy!
[36:00] I wasn’t ready for such a big responsibility, mom!
[36:04] This has all happened because of Chanda!
[36:09] All of it.
[36:11] You can tell how heartless
[36:15] she is by the fact that she didn’t even come to see her dad’s face for the last time!
[36:22] You took her to the doctor, what did he say?
[36:28] Nothing, he just gave some vitamins...
[36:30] Okay! What vitamins?
[36:36] Chanda knows, she has the presciption!
[36:40] Go and get the presciption
[36:43] She is sleeping right now
[36:44] Wake her up and get it
