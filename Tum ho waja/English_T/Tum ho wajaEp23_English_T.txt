[00:46] Asalam o alikum
[00:46] Walikum Salam.
[00:48] How come you’re here?
[00:50] Mr. Wajid, I’ve brought Bhabhi Sahiba’s house papers.
[00:55] Keep these.
[00:57] The market value of the house is around 60 to 65 lacs.
[01:02] Give me the remaining money after what it takes to release Babar,
[01:08] I’ll give it Bhabhi Sahiba.
[01:13] What was the need to bring these papers to release Babar?
[01:17] I would have given the money anyways.
[01:21] Mr. Wajid, you won my heart.
[01:27] I’ve started respecting you from my heart.
[01:30] You’ll do so much for the sake of your friendship with my late brother.
[01:41] Not only because of the sake of the friendship from your brother
[01:45] in fact I am doing all this for my love.
[01:56] I don’t understand Mr Wajid..
[02:01] I want to marry her and keep her with me in this house forever.
[02:13] Oh wow.. You’re not just a human, I would say you’re an angel.
[02:21] You’re supporting the unsupported.
[02:24] You’re such a great man.
[02:26] God will reward this deed of yours
[02:31] but I don’t think sister in law will agree.
[02:44] Convincing your sister in law will be beneficial for you..
[02:47] Yes yes. Mr. Wajid, I will try my best
[02:51] d she might get convinced maybe because of the future of her children
[02:56] and in order to save them from struggling door to door.
[03:01] I am only thinking that it’s such a good deed to marry a widow.
[03:11] Widow?
[03:13] Yes. It’s obvious that my sister in law is a widow after my brother’s passing.
[03:22] I want to marry Sitara.
[03:35] What?
[03:40] To Sitara?
[03:48] But..
[03:51] Mr Wajid,
[03:55] Sitara is a child..
[04:00] It’s not like I’m about to die.
[04:04] . I have a house, a car and a bank balance.
[04:07] What do I lack?
[04:10] Of course. All these things are justified but..
[04:19] But what Mr. Muraad?
[04:27] What are you thinking about?
[04:31] Mr. Wajid,
[04:35] I am thinking if I do all this that you’re asking for then
[04:47] what will I get in return?
[04:57] It will also be beneficial for you Mr. Muraad.
[05:01] Look, I will take up the cost of getting Babar released
[05:07] and along with that property, these papers, this house can be yours.
[05:18] The deal isn’t too bad, think about it..
[05:22] This house, this property can be under your name. Think about it..
[05:41] Uncle isn’t here yet mom..
[05:44] He has gone to arrange the money.
[05:47] I’ve made soup for you, you like it don’t you.
[05:50] Drink it while it’s hot.
[05:54] Here you go..
[06:03] Mom what.. Mom! Mom! What has happened?
[06:08] I’ve been asking to eat something.
[06:10] You haven’t eaten anything since morning.
[06:11] If you don’t feel like eating this then I’ll make something else for you.
[06:15] I’ll eat something once I’m done praying.
[06:21] You’re okay right?
[06:36] Sitara!
[06:43] Sitara!
[06:45] Coming uncle!
[06:50] Yes uncle?
[06:54] I want to talk to you about something important. Come and sit.
[06:57] Come.. Come and sit here.
[07:00] Is everything okay?
[07:01] Yes.
[07:14] Look, brother has left this world and Babar is also in prison.
[07:28] Bhabhi Sahib is also very worried because of Babar.
[07:35] I am afraid that she won’t be able to endure so much trauma.
[07:42] What if something happens to her God forbid..
[07:45] God forbid..
[07:48] But sitara if you want..
[07:54] .. I mean to say if Babar comes out then everything will be fine.
[08:00] You’re right.
[08:03] Mom is very worried because of this..
[08:06] But you know that we need 30 to 35 lacs in order to take Babar out of jail.
[08:15] We haven’t been able to arrange any money uptil now
[08:21] But Sitara the money could be arranged if you want..
[08:33] How is that?
[08:38] You’ll have to sign on the marriage license.
[08:49] On the marriage license?
[08:51] Yes.
[08:54] Sitara, Mr. Wajid’s only condition is that he’ll give the money after marrying you.
[09:09] What are you saying?
[09:12] How could you even think of that?
[09:14] Listen to me..
[09:15] Even enemies are far more than you. Mom!
[09:18] Sitara..
[09:18] Mom!
[09:19] Uncle.. Tea.. Tea..
[09:22] Tea..
[09:24] hmm
[09:26] Tea..
[09:26] Okay..
[09:28] I’ll also make mom have breakfast, she hasn’t eaten anything since yesterday.
[09:31] I am so worried for her, she won’t eat until I don’t feed her myself.
[09:45] I have brought tea for you and cake rusk.
[09:49] You haven’t eaten anything since yesterday.
[09:51] You won't eat anything, I’ll have to feed you myself.
[09:53] Come on..
[09:55] Mom..
[09:58] Mom..
[10:00] Mom?
[10:04] Mom?
[10:05] Mom..
[10:06] Mom.. Mom..
[10:08] Uncle!
[10:10] Mom! Mom!
[10:12] Sitara..
[10:13] I can’t let you go anywhere..
[10:15] : Mom!
[10:16] Uncle!
[10:17] Mom!
[10:18] What happened?
[10:18] Uncle, mom!
[10:20] Sister in law!
[10:20] Mom! Mom!
[10:22] Sister in law..
[10:22] Mom!
[10:23] Sister in law.. Sister in law..
[10:24] I can’t let mom go anywhere. What’s wrong with mom..
[10:27] Sister in law! Nothing has happened to her.
[10:29] She is only unconscious, she has a pulse.
[10:30] We’ll take her to the hospital. I’ll go get the car..
[10:33] Mom! Mom! Mom!
[10:35] Mom! Mom!
[10:36] Uncle,
[10:37] Mom, you’ll see that you’ll be fine soon. You only have to show strength okay?
[10:41] Mom..
[10:45] You can't come inside..
[10:46] She is my mother, at least let me inside..
[10:48] It’s not allowed to come inside..
[10:51] Uncle, they’re not letting me go in.
[10:53] Let the doctors do their work.
[10:56] We have come to the hospital, Inshallah everything will be fine.
[10:59] I want to be with mom.. Please..
[11:02] Don’t worry. Come with me.. Come here.. Come sit here..
[11:17] What are you doing?
[11:18] Mom..
[11:22] You were right when you told me I should control my anger.
[11:25] I am paying for my anger today!
[11:26] But what could I have done, mom?
[11:28] He was taking Erum with him, what could I have done mom?
[11:48] Just pray for mom.
[11:50] Yes..
[11:51] When Zain comes back from school don't tell him that mom’s this unwell.
[11:59] Let’s see what happens, I am very worried, myself.
[12:04] Are you with Mrs. Mansoor?
[12:05] Yes, we’re with her. What has happened to her? Is she fine?
[12:08] Dr, she had fainted back at the house. Is everything okay now?
[12:13] Her blood pressure has shot up,
[12:15] we’re treating her, it’s not getting in control.
[12:17] Do one thing, get these medicines
[12:19] and get her file ready at the reception.
[12:23] Sure.
[12:26] Dr, mom will be fine right?
[12:29] Just pray..
[12:55] Yes mama. I’m leaving from home, I’ll be there in 10 minutes.
[13:01] Okay.
[13:12] Your stubbornness
[13:17] and ego is ruining the both of us.
[13:32] I have already gotten ruined.
[13:36] I disobeyed my parents by marrying you.
[13:46] Disobeyed?
[13:49] I also disobeyed my parents.
[13:53] Did I ask you to disobey them?
[13:56] You married me with your own will
[14:00] and now suffer the consequences
[14:03] Go and mend things with them,
[14:06] no one is stopping you.
[14:08] What are you doing standing here for?
[14:24] I will mend things with everyone after mending things with you
[14:31] Don’t go along with this marriage, don’t.
[14:36] Why don’t you look at me? Please look at me.
[14:40] . I am saying something to you.. Don’t go along with this marriage, don’t.
[14:53] look
[15:00] Your eyes are screaming of sadness
[15:08] and happiness?
[15:20] That is not visible in your eyes
[15:37] Then look into my eyes, look at your own face in these eyes.
[15:47] All you’ll see is a killer and nothing else.
[16:14] How is mom feeling now?
[16:16] Thank god her blood pressure is normal now, we are shifting her to the ward.
[16:19] Can I meet her now?
[16:20] Yes, of course you can go.
[16:22] Thank you..
[16:30] Mom..
[16:34] are you feeling better now?
[16:41] What had happened to me?
[16:43] It was nothing serious, you only had high blood pressure.
[16:50] Zain.. Where’s Zain?
[16:53] He has come back from school, he is with bhabhi.
[16:57] Don’t tell Babar that I am here..
[17:03] You are not allowed to talk much..
[17:06] You have to rest.
[17:09] They’ll shift you to the ward in a while.
[17:12] I spoke to the doctor,
[17:14] she said there is nothing to worry about.
[17:22] Yes, Murad! Assalam o Alaikum.
[17:25] Wajid Sahib, it’s me Murad.
[17:27] What’s the update on my work?
[17:29] Wajid Sahib, your task isn’t as easy as you think it is.
[17:34] And there has come a new problem over here!
[17:36] What happened now?
[17:38] Bhabi Sahiba fell ill all of a sudden.
[17:40] Her blood pressure shot up. She became unconscious.
[17:43] I have brought her to the hospital!
[17:46] Hello? Wajid Sahib?
[17:48] This means that she is also about to go. Won’t that make our work easier
[17:55] You’re mistaken, Wajid Sahib! This task is extremely difficult!
[18:00] I’ll do something. I’ll come to the hospital and that way I can meet Sitara…
[18:04] No, no!
[18:06] Wajid Sahib, what are you saying? There’s no need for you to come here.
[18:09] I will inform you myself as soon as your work is done.
[18:11] At least hear me out…
[18:18] Alright, Murad. As you wish.
[18:22] The marriage contract is extremely important!
[19:12] : I can’t see mom in this condition!
[19:17] She’s stressed because of Bhai.
[19:20] Sitara, control yourself.
[19:22] Tayi Jaan will lose whatever little hope she has left if you’re going to cry like this.
[19:26] What if Bhai doesn’t come back?
[19:28] What’s going to happen then?
[19:34] Danish…
[19:38] My child, I’m trying so hard.
[19:41] I’m trying so hard to make you strong.
[19:43] I’m spending all my time here.
[19:46] For who, my child? For you guys!
[19:50] And these tears of yours, Sitara. They’re making me weak.
[19:54] For god sake, be there for me.
[19:58] Be strong and stay by my side.
[20:08] Yes, Danish?
[20:09] Assalam o Alaikum, dad?
[20:11] I’m really worried after hearing about Tayi Jaan.
[20:14] Look, my child.
[20:16] You being upset is not going to do any good to your Tayi Jaan or you.
[20:22] You just pray that Allah Almighty takes us out of this trial as soon as possible.
[20:30] Dad, I have full faith in you.
[20:32] But you just somehow get Babar Bhai released.
[20:36] Son, I’m trying my best. Babar will come out in a couple of days.
[20:41] Sister in law is also stable now.
[20:44] The doctors have said that she will be discharged tomorrow.
[20:49] Alright, dad.
[20:50] I’m sending you some money, you make sure you get them.
[20:54] Oh no, son! What are you saying?
[20:56] It’s not like I’m going to leave anything. She’s my sister in law!
[21:00] Alright, dad. Allah Hafiz.
[21:02] Khuda hafiz
[21:06] What was the need for you to bother him abroad?
[21:11] I felt very restless. I’m sorry.
[21:16] Take this.
[21:35] Open your eyes now.
[21:51] So? How do you like your new house?
[21:58] You can’t do this!
[22:01] How can someone else take my place?
[22:08] No!
[22:11] You can’t do this!
[22:15] You can’t do this! You can’t do this!
[22:20] No one can take my place! No one can take my place! No one!
[22:30] Doctor,
[22:33] can I take my patient home?
[22:36] What are you saying?
[22:38] You should be grateful that she didn’t suffer from brain hemorrhage!
[22:42] She’s in a very critical condition!
[22:44] Yes, thank god for that.
[22:46] Actually doctor, the thing is that she’s my sister in law and she’s a widow
[22:52] so all the responsibilities are on my shoulders and I am a very simple man.
[22:58] I won’t be able to afford the bills for this big hospital of yours.
[23:05] : I’ll try and find out if there’s any way I can get you help from the charity fund.
[23:10] You will have to sign a few papers for that.
[23:12] You can come with me.
[23:13] I’ll come.
[23:27] Come! Sarfaraz….
[23:29] Come.
[23:31] Oh my god! This… What is all this?
[23:37] Shamim!
[23:39] Shamim! Did you die or what! Who did this!
[23:42] Who is it that had the guts to ruin the room like this?
[23:45] Oh my! This… Who could do all this?
[23:50] Shamim!
[23:53] I’m the one who did all of this!
[24:06] I did all of this.
[24:08] How dare….
[24:10] Enough!
[24:14] Move away.
[24:16] Move away.
[24:19] And you?
[24:21] What do you think?
[24:23] You can take my place in this house?
[24:25] Get out. Get out of here!
[24:27] What’s going on?
[24:29] I can tolerate anything but I won’t tolerate her in this house!
[24:33] Have you gone mad?
[24:34] Go away from here! Yes, I have gone mad!
[24:37] Do you know who you’re talking to?
[24:39] This is my mother and she’s my wife!
[24:43] I can tolerate everything. Didn’t I say that? But I won’t tolerate her.
[24:47] I am going to kill her!
[24:48] You have gone mad and nothing else!
[24:49] I’ll kill her!
[25:00] Aunty,
[25:02] you said that this girl’s worth in this house was just that of a maid?
[25:06] Then what the hell is this?
[25:10] You guys do one thing. Go and sit in the lounge.
[25:14] Shebi? You take Sana downstairs. I’ll deal with her.
[25:17] You can’t go anywhere!
[25:18] Get out!
[25:19] She won’t go! She won’t go! Let go of me! Leave me!
[25:23] Sit comfortably. We’re just coming, alright?
[25:31] You put out a knife?
[25:33] On me?
[25:34] On my family members?
[25:35] You embarrassed us in front of Sana?
[25:37] You did the right thing. You’re the one who’s going to fix this now!
[25:42] I’m sitting here. Right in front of you. Come on!
[25:47] Why are you standing? Start cleaning!
[25:56] Why did you guys do this to me?
[26:00] Didn’t you feel any pity?
[26:03] How cruel are you guys!
[26:08] You poisoned your son so much that he turned against me and got married?
[26:19] Don’t you feel any pity for me?
[26:21] We did pity you! We pitied you!
[26:25] We felt sorry for you and that’s why we told your mother to refuse this proposal!
[26:31] But no! She didn’t refuse!
[26:33] You’re paying for her deeds today!
[26:45] What? What did you just say?
[26:50] Mom wasn’t the one who refused?
[26:54] In fact, you guys are the ones who forced her to…
[26:57] Yes, yes! What else could we have done?
[26:59] Brought someone like you in the house?
[27:02] Why would we become bad in our only son Shebi’s eyes?
[27:05] By saying that we don’t accept you?
[27:10] Yours and Shebi’s marriage ruined the entire plan!
[27:16] Your brother came over? That goon?
[27:20] We insulted and kicked him out!
[27:24] And then your mother comes. Accept my daughter!
[27:27] Don’t let my husband find out!
[27:29] We reminded her of her worth!
[27:31] We kicked her out!
[27:33] We made each and every member understand that we don’t accept you!
[27:36] We don’t accept you!
[27:39] But no!
[27:41] You guys didn’t understand so now pay for it!
[27:42] Pay for it!
[27:52] Such an important day of my life,
[27:54] the day I have been waiting for my whole life!
[27:57] That Chanda ruined everything!
[28:17] Shahab? Are you stressed out?
[28:22] Actually, the situation is such.
[28:25] You must be worried but don’t worry…
[28:31] I’m sorry.
[28:33] Actually, I have a really bad headache.
[28:36] I don’t know why…
[28:37] Lean back, I’ll press it…
[28:39] No, no.
[28:42] It’s okay.
[28:45] It happens with me sometimes…
[28:48] When I’m stressed out.
[28:52] I’ll be fine if I go to sleep.
[28:56] Yes.
[29:04] I’ll sleep in the guest room today.
[29:11] Sana, I’m sorry.
[29:14] I don’t know why…
[29:15] a lot happened today. Didn’t you see the scene she created?
[29:21] I am really stressed.
[29:23] I just hope you understand.
[29:30] I do understand. Don’t worry.
[29:37] Thank you.
[29:39] Shahab!
[29:45] Sleep over here.
[29:47] It won’t look nice if you go out.
[29:50] And I’m absolutely fine, don’t worry.
[30:14] All of fifteen thousand. The work should be done now.
[30:19] Keep it, I’ll explain everything to you.
[30:21] Mom isn’t well.
[30:24] They’ve shifted her to the ward.
[30:27] Has Zain reached?
[30:30] Please give him food.
[30:33] Sitara, my child. I spoke to the doctor.
[30:36] She’s saying that Bhabhi Sahiba’s condition isn’t getting stable
[30:40] so there’s a possibility that she might have to stay here for a week or two.
[30:44] My child, this is such an expensive hospital and I don’t have any…. So I filled the charity fund…
[30:50] Charity fund?
[30:51] My child, we are helpless.
[30:52] It’s about your mom’s health and life. You just pray that they…
[30:57] It’s about your mom’s health and life. You just pray that they…
[31:00] Yes. Is it approved?
[31:02] Yes.
[31:03] Please sign over here.
[31:04] Do I sign or does her actual daughter sign?
[31:07] The daughter.
[31:08] The daughter.
[31:10] What’s happening? What’s written in it?
[31:11] This an application for the hospital. I have read it, my child. You read it too.
[31:16] Yes, yes. Read it fast and please sign on it.
[31:20] You read it
[31:21] The patient’s blood pressure is shooting up a lot. You go inside, I’ll call the doctor.
[31:25] Uncle…
[31:25] You please sign fast.
[31:27] Yes, yes
[31:27] Give it to me.
[31:28] Over here. My child, here.
[31:32] My child, here.
[33:10] Here you go.
[33:14] Oh! Wow, wow, wow!
[33:17] This means that Sitara is now my legal wife?
[33:21] Definitely.
[33:23] Congratulations!
[33:25] Many congratulations.
[33:27] Thank you. You just tell me this right now.
[33:30] These signatures that are done on these papers, did Sitara sign them happily or ….
[33:38] Forget about it, Wajid Sahib.
[33:42] Happily or sadly, what difference does that make?
[33:44] You tell me, what’s up with my work?
[33:48] To get Babar released….
[33:49] No, no, no! No! Don’t let Babar go until that house is in my name.
[33:59] It’ll be done.
[34:00] It will be done and it will be done very soon.
[34:02] You just give this marriage contract…
[34:05] What do you do?
[34:07] I’m not a weak player either.
[34:11] I’ll take something from one hand while I give you this from the other.
[34:41] My daughter is not an orphan
[34:44] Come lets go Chanda
[34:48] Where?
[34:50] Home
[34:53] This is my home now,mom
[34:57] I will now die in this house
[35:03] Mom
