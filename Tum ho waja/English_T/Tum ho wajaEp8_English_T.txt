[00:36] Mama I am very very very happy today.
[00:38] Oh wow.
[00:39] I have seen my son this happy after so many days. What’s the reason?
[00:42] It’s because the news is so great,
[00:43] you’ll also start dancing when you hear it.
[00:47] Tell us already, what’s the good news?
[00:49] Then listen,
[00:51] you and you are about to become grandfather and grandmother.
[00:59] Mama, I won’t keep Chanda there now.
[01:05] But she won’t come into this house.
[01:11] But dad..
[01:16] Look son, I think you have a memory problem.
[01:21] Let’s start from the beginning..
[01:24] Me, Ghafoor counselor took your proposal to that girl’s house for your happiness.
[01:33] What did I get in return? Insult.
[01:37] I went to that man’s office for your happiness so that maybe he’ll listen to my request,
[01:44] what answer did I get in return? More insult.
[01:48] That scoundrel, your brother in law,
[01:54] insulted me in my own house for the matter of your happiness.
[01:59] You tell me,
[02:01] till when will we get insulted by these loser people for your happiness?
[02:05] Please tell me!
[02:12] Dad I haven’t forgotten your insult
[02:17] but I also can’t leave Chanda there alone.
[02:21] When did I ask you to leave her there alone?
[02:25] Then you tell me what should I do?
[02:27] Hire some woman who will take care of her there.
[02:32] So you two don’t want her to stay in this house ever?
[02:35] No, never.
[02:38] You will not accept her again?
[02:41] I have said it, never.
[02:49] Fine then,
[02:52] I will also leave this house.
[03:03] Really? Just because of that girl you will…
[03:04] She is not just another girl anymore!
[03:07] She is the mother of my unborn child!
[03:10] Shebi..
[03:10] She will come in this house now otherwise I will also leave!
[03:14] The decision is in the hands of you two.
[03:18] He will leave the house..
[03:20] Let him leave if he wants to!
[03:23] But you..
[03:25] What me? What you?
[03:28] Nobody is of any value for him now, all he thinks about is Chanda only
[03:31] And don’t you dare and stop him or if you go after him!
[03:35] I will also watch him struggle in this world now, I will also see how he will survive!
[03:39] You are saying that he should go and struggle but will you be able to see it?
[03:43] Will you be able to see him struggle?
[03:46] I know he has made a mistake and he should get punished.
[03:51] He was so happy to announce that you two are about to become grandfather and grandmother.
[03:56] How would a son know how the world treats you who has lived all his life on his father’s money?
[04:03] You are right.
[04:04] Go! Go and kick him out and ask him to leave the house!
[04:08] Why are you standing here? Go!
[04:23] Chanda!
[04:24] Many congratulations! Shahab gave me the good news.
[04:29] I don’t know what to do..
[04:31] I feel like lighting up firecrackers,
[04:34] distribute sweets,
[04:35] I feel like distributing food and sweets to the poor in the whole city but what do I do..
[04:38] your uncle is a poor man.
[04:50] What are you saying uncle?
[04:52] Nobody does what all you have done for me, you are very wealthy from your heart..
[04:59] Oh that’s just..
[05:00] And I knew that you would be the most happy in my happiness.
[05:06] And why wouldn’t I be? Only the lucky people get to be grandfathers.
[05:14] I wish I could have seen the same happiness on my brother’s face
[05:23] but what can we do?
[05:25] My sister in law has always embraced misfortune.
[05:31] What could have happened if she wouldn’t have made it a big deal
[05:34] and my brother wouldn’t have gotten upset with you
[05:38] but she will never do that.
[05:40] She still wants for you to be out of this house
[05:46] What was the need to bring Babar and the children here for picnic?
[05:53] I don’t understand what’s inside her heart.. What does she want..
[05:56] All she has is hate for me.
[06:01] She could never stand the love dad had for me,
[06:06] that is why she’s doing all this.
[06:10] You don’t get upset, just leave her on her own, to hell with her..
[06:20] I’ll go get some fruit for you.
[06:24] Look, God has given you such good news.
[06:30] You have to take care of it and you’re not supposed to take any tension.
[06:33] Sit down, I’ll go get fruit. Good girl.
[06:46] I don’t know what would have happened if uncle wouldn’t have been here for me today..
[06:55] You love me right?
[07:00] I can’t break dad’s hope, honor and trust,
[07:05] never..
[07:28] You don’t even have a little trust or confidence in me?
[07:35] You refused to me with such sternness.
[07:47] Shebi! What is this madness?
[07:51] This is not madness, this is my final decision just because of you and dad’s stubbornness.
[07:55] We are not being stubborn anymore.
[08:00] We accept what you’re saying.
[08:03] Son, you are our life
[08:10] Our happiness is in your happiness..
[08:14] End your stubbornness and bring your wife..
[08:20] And dad?
[08:23] Your dad has agreed..
[08:28] Alright then, I’ll go bring Chanda right now.
[08:31] Not like this, at least give me some time for preparations.
[08:38] What kind of preparations?
[08:45] My wish of seeing you as a groom didn’t get fulfilled,
[08:50] I can at least welcome my daughter in law with grandeur.
[09:04] One minute..
[09:09] Chanda is your wife, she can live in your house, I kept my ego aside.
[09:15] But on one condition,
[09:18] she will cut ties with her parents and siblings
[09:21] and nor will her parents or siblings come here ever.
[09:25] Dad..
[09:26] Never ever.
[09:29] She will either keep her relationship with you or with her family forever.
[09:34] Okay dad,
[09:37] I accept every condition of yours
[09:40] I knew that you love me a lot dad, you wouldn’t let me go anywhere.
[09:56] Children are a test..
[10:16] Sahiba where are you?
[10:23] Chanda..
[10:39] Sitara.
[10:50] Sitara?
[10:59] Sitara!
[11:03] I am coming in okay? Sitara?
[11:10] Sitara
[11:21] I know you love me. I will come to meet you today.
[11:26] You will hold my hand and accept it yourself.
[11:30] I have good news for you..
[11:32] What kind of good news?
[11:33] You’re about to become a grandmother.
[11:36] What?
[11:39] Sitara! Sitara! Sahiba!
[11:46] Yes dad?
[11:47] Where is your mother?
[11:49] One minute, I’ll call her..
[11:53] Sitara!
[11:59] What happened?
[12:01] Mansoor?
[12:02] What happened?
[12:03] What’s happening?
[12:04] Where is Sitara? Sitara!
[12:06] Sitara? What is it? What is it? Leave her!
[12:08] What happened?
[12:09] You’re asking me? I leave her?
[12:10] Ask her what she has been doing!
[12:12] What did I do dad? I didn’t do anything. What happened?
[12:14] You lie to me?
[12:15] Look at this! Danish’s messages.
[12:18] You’re his sister right?
[12:20] Of course you’ll try and deceive me. Shameless girl!
[12:23] Leave her. Show me the messages..
[12:24] To hell with it!
[12:26] I swear to you..
[12:27] There is no need to swear on my name!
[12:28] I swear to god!
[12:29] Where did these messages come from?
[12:30] Do one thing, do one thing, instead of killing me slowly, it’s better that you kill me right now!
[12:35] Kill me!
[12:36] Tell me what the messages say?
[12:38] I tell you?
[12:39] What did she do?
[12:40] I am dying out of embarrassment!
[12:43] I don’t know what sin I committed that I have gotten such daughters!
[12:46] Dad listen to me once, I didn’t do anything..
[12:48] For the love of god Mansoor, for the love of god leave her.
[12:51] I have started hating you and I have started hating you too.
[12:54] Don’t come in front of me again. Get out of here!
[12:56] Get out of here! Get the hell out!
[12:58] She will not study or go out anymore!
[13:00] Please take care of your health..
[13:02] To hell with my health! Pray that Mansoor dies!
[13:07] What are you saying? You are my life!
[13:09] You destroyed my life!
[13:11] You couldn’t take care of these girls?
[13:13] You couldn’t know what they were up to?
[13:16] One daughter has already embarrassed me and the second one is also about to do it!
[13:20] What are you saying? It’s not like that..
[13:22] Please sit, I’ll go get water for you..
[13:24] Get the hell out of here!
[13:27] She’s not supposed to get out of the room again!
[13:29] I’ll see to it.
[13:37] Mansoor? Mansoor? Please stop, you’re not well. Listen..
[13:43] Asalam o alikum uncle..
[13:45] Why have you come here? Leave the same way you came inside.
[13:50] But uncle what did I do?
[13:51] Your uncle has died, you took his life!
[13:55] Mansoor, let’s go inside and talk..
[13:57] I don’t want to talk
[13:59] and there is no need to tell what I should do and what I shouldn’t.
[14:02] Get the hell out of here!
[14:03] Uncle, what have I done after all?
[14:05] You also tried to harm my home by seeing it’s base going weak.
[14:11] For the love of god.. What are you saying uncle? I would never think of doing anything wrong..
[14:15] Enough
[14:18] Don’t tell me about what nice and what bad you can do for me.
[14:20] Go away from here. I don’t even want to see your face.
[14:24] I won’t leave until I find out why you are angry with me.
[14:28] You shouldn’t have done this.
[14:30] You should have brought a proposal with Muraad instead of messaging Sitara..
[14:34] What proposal?
[14:39] I don’t want to tie any relationship with them
[14:41] and what we had, that also has ended.
[14:47] Get out of here!
[14:49] Uncle, my relationship with you all can never end.
[14:53] I will kill you if you stand here for one more moment.
[14:59] Uncle I know I’ve made a mistake and I hurt you
[15:05] that is why I ask for forgiveness and I want to go get the magistrate with dad..
[15:12] I will not forgive you or Sitara
[15:20] and there is no need to bring anyone here.
[15:22] What are you saying? He is your own blood.
[15:24] My blood has become white.
[15:27] It’s betrayal, only betrayal.
[15:33] When my own daughter can do all this to me
[15:35] then how can I complain about others?
[15:38] Get the hell out of here. Get out! Get out! I say get out!
[15:41] But uncle..
[15:42] Get out of here!
[15:43] But uncle..
[15:45] Go on, get out!
[15:47] Uncle! Uncle, you’re wrong!
[16:06] Hello! I am coming! I am coming in a while!
[16:54] What are you doing Chanda? Leave it, leave it.
[16:57] Let me water..
[16:58] Leave it. I’ll do it.
[17:00] Come here, come. Sit, sit down. Good girl.
[17:04] Take this, drink fresh juice.
[17:06] I have made it with my own house. Take it.
[17:10] What is this? You didn’t let me make breakfast in the morning also
[17:14] and now you’ve brought juice, what are you doing uncle?
[17:17] I am trying to play your mothers role.
[17:24] Uncle you said mom will come, when will she come?
[17:31] I think she will come when she will have time
[17:35] You finish your juice, I’ll call you later.
[17:38] I’ll be back in two minutes. Good girl.
[17:55] Go in your room, go.
[17:56] Mom,
[18:00] Mom, I didn’t do anything.
[18:01] I swear to god I didn’t even know what message,
[18:05] when he messaged, why he messaged. I swear..
[18:08] You had no clue that Danish likes you?
[18:11] I didn’t know anything..
[18:15] I had my doubts, from him and from you.
[18:18] Yes but I didn’t do anything.
[18:20] I didn’t do anything because of dad. I swear to god I didn’t do anything.
[18:25] If he would have spoken to Muraad, if he would have brought a proposal properly
[18:28] then your father would have accepted him happily.
[18:31] I don’t accept anybody’s proposal, I don’t accept it.
[18:34] dad has started hating me because of these people.
[18:37] Please ask dad not to hate me.
[18:40] I haven’t done anything.
[18:41] I promise I haven’t done anything wrong.
[18:44] I can never do it, I can’t even think of harming dad’s respect..
[18:49] Okay fine..
[18:50] Please ask him not to hate me mom..
[18:53] Okay okay.. stop crying.. I’ll talk to him..
[19:03] How have they arranged these flowers?
[19:08] Mama! You have made the entire room shine!
[19:13] Looks nice, right?
[19:14] Yes! Thank you so much.
[19:16] You’re welcome!
[19:18] And mama, I have also ordered the flowers. They’ll be here by evening.
[19:23] The fragrance is important, right?
[19:25] Oh, my son! What’s the need for flowers?
[19:29] I know that the entire house will smell beautiful when my daughter in law comes.
[19:33] And especially, when my granddaughter and grandson play over here!
[19:39] Even our lives will be beautiful then.
[19:42] And do you know, mama?
[19:43] I haven’t told Chanda that I am going to pick her.
[19:47] It’ll be a surprise for her
[19:48] when she finds out that you and baba are waiting for her in this house.
[19:53] Yes. Indeed.
[19:55] I love you.
[20:01] Don’t you have the manners?
[20:02] Don’t you know the way to enter someone’s room?
[20:03] You’re going to teach me manners? Do you have any yourself?
[20:06] What has happened to you? How are you talking to me?
[20:09] The way you have ruined all of our lives… it’s pointless talking to you!
[20:14] I will complain to uncle about you!
[20:16] Go! Complain! It would’ve been better if he was home right now.
[20:19] I would’ve told him to kick you out of this house!
[20:22] You would’ve gotten me kicked out of this house?
[20:24] This is my uncle’s house! So that means that it is also my house!
[20:28] You set your own house on fire!
[20:30] Shut up!
[20:33] You’re the one who has done it but we should bear the consequences?
[20:36] Even then you won’t be ashamed, Chanda!
[20:38] Yeah, so? Whatever I did was completely right!
[20:41] You can see how everybody is so comfortable in their own lives!
[20:45] Nobody has any problem, any issues. Everything is fine!
[20:48] What do you think? Everybody is busy in their lives?
[20:51] You’re selfish and pathetic!
[20:52] The trouble that Sitara has to go through!
[20:55] Because of your one stupid decision, Taya Jaan has stopped trusting her!
[20:58] Poor girl is always and always crying! Bearing insults!
[21:04] Chanda! I should not see you in this house before tomorrow morning! Did you hear me?
[21:12] Ill mannered!
[21:17] What has happened to Abu?
[21:19] He’s scolding that poor girl for no reason.
[21:22] I am the one who did everything, he should say something to me.
[21:41] I didn’t even do anything!
[21:56] Even then this is happening.
[22:00] Everything is getting ruined.
[22:03] There’s nothing in my hands.
[22:09] If dad doesn’t talk to me, I’ll give away my life.
[22:19] I don’t know what sin I committed that I have gotten such daughters!
[22:24] I’ll give away my life! I will give away my life! He will get convinced then, right?
[22:34] Mom, I’m very hungry. Please serve the food!
[22:37] Mom has gone to Aapi’s house.
[22:40] What did you say? Where has she gone?
[22:44] No, brother. Nothing. It just slipped out of my mouth.
[22:47] I’ll slap you! Tell me the truth, where has mom gone?
[22:51] No, brother, no. I was joking with you. She hasn’t gone anywhere!
[22:58] You know it’s my fault only.
[23:01] I am always so furious that you guys get scared of me.
[23:05] But I am your elder brother. Yours and Chanda’s as well.
[23:08] I am worried about Chanda. I was missing her since so many days. It’s good that you told me.
[23:14] I….I’ll go right now and meet her at her house.
[23:17] No! Chanda Aapi is at Muraad uncle’s house.
[23:20] I think mom has also gone there only.
[23:22] How do you know?
[23:24] I heard mom talking to Muraad uncle on the phone.
[23:34] Brother! Brother!
[23:39] I came here running as soon as I found out!
[23:45] This news must have fallen really hard on you, right?
[23:49] What are you saying, Chanda?
[23:52] I won’t be happy in my children’s happiness?
[23:55] Happiness?
[23:57] If you had cared even a little about my happiness, I wouldn’t be here today!
[24:03] Because of you, I am in this state today!
[24:06] Because of you, dad and everyone has started to hate me!
[24:12] So much so, that even my in laws aren’t ready to accept me!
[24:17] I told you, right? I told you to go to Shahab’s house and ask forgiveness from everyone!
[24:21] What did you do!
[24:23] You went there and uttered poison! You created hatred!
[24:29] And you say that you are happy?
[24:32] What have I done to you? Why are you doing this with me!
[24:36] I went there to beg for your happiness!
[24:38] You’re lying! You’re lying!
[24:41] Oh, Chanda, my child! What are you doing?
[24:45] She’s your mother. You cannot talk to your mother in this tone.
[24:50] Look, my child.
[24:52] A mother never wishes bad for her children, no matter what.
[24:56] Your mom did what she thought was right for you.
[25:00] And look,
[25:01] it’s not right for you to take stress in the condition that you are in right now.
[25:04] Take care, okay?
[25:05] Alright, so tell her! Tell her to go away from here
[25:09] And what has she done to me?
[25:11] My weddings first gift…. She even took my ring away!
[25:15] Why would I take your ring, Chanda?
[25:19] What do you think of yourself?
[25:21] And what do you think, that you’ll do all of this and turn Shahab against me?
[25:26] You’ll succeed in your plans?
[25:29] That won’t happen at all!
[25:30] Go away from here! Go!
[25:36] Babar! What happened?
[25:42] What are you doing!
[25:43] You’ll waste not just one but two lives if you kill her!
[25:46] And what about the fact that she killed all of us while we’re alive?
[25:48] You’re still supporting her?
[25:50] She has given us so much insult!
[25:52] People are spitting on us and you’re sitting here, keeping her close to your heart?
[25:57] But I won’t let that happen!
[25:59] I will kill her!
[26:00] Babar, she has made a mistake but you cannot kill her!
[26:02] Move away! Go away from here!
[26:05] And what are you talking about? Uncle, are you seeing that?
[26:08] My own people are standing here as my enemies!
[26:12] What you did wasn’t right at all!
[26:13] You kept me and dad in the dark! And now, I won’t spare her!
[26:17] Get out of here!
[26:18] What am I saying to you? Leave me!
[26:20] Go away! Get out of here!
[26:23] Chanda! Chanda! Chanda!
[26:25] Don’t touch me!
[26:27] Stay away from me! Stay away from me!
[26:31] I hate you!
[26:35] Go away from here…. Go away from here!
[27:04] I’ll just go get her warm milk.
[27:25] I hate you!
[27:29] If dad hadn’t been by my side in this life,
[27:33] then you would’ve killed me a long time ago!
[27:54] Leave him! I have married him by my own choice!
[28:07] Instead of killing me slowly, it’s better that you kill me right now! Kill me!
[28:23] Oh! What happened, Mansoor Bhai? Are you okay? Did you get dizzy?
[28:28] Yes. No, no. I am alright.
[28:31] What was the need for you to come here? Go home and rest.
[28:36] Yes. I’ll….
[28:49] Chanda!
[28:51] Get up, my child. Get up, get up! Take this! I have brought turmeric milk for you. Get up.
[28:55] Sit. Drink some of this. You’ll feel lesser pain.
[29:05] Ill literate, ill mannered!
[29:07] Bhabhi hasn’t taught Babar any manners at all.
[29:13] I am just scared, what am I going to say to Shebi?
[29:15] No, no, uncle! Shahab shouldn’t find out.
[29:20] God knows what all he’ll do out of anger. Don’t tell him. Please!
[29:24] You’re right, my child. But
[29:27] the way Babar has found out that you’re here,
[29:31] the same way Shebi can also find out about the way he treated you.
[29:38] But… how did brother know that I was here?
[29:45] What are you saying, my child?
[29:48] Who else can tell him this other than your mother?
[29:55] Mom?
[29:57] Obviously, my child.
[29:59] Sister in law! Who else other than sister in law knows that you’re here?
[30:06] By the way, what a game she has played! She’s the one to kill and she’s the one to save.
[30:18] My child, you’re getting a call.
[30:22] It’s Shebi’s.
[30:23] No, I won’t talk. It’ll become a problem, uncle.
[30:26] Get hold of yourself and talk to him. Here, talk to him.
[30:34] Hello?
[30:35] Hello, Chanda? How are you?
[30:38] Yes, Shahab?
[30:41] What happened? Why is your voice so heavy?
[30:44] Everything’s fine, right?
[30:46] No, no. I am completely fine! It’s just that I was getting worried since you hadn’t come.
[30:52] I was just a little busy.
[30:56] Alright, listen to me Chanda. I am coming to pick you.
[31:01] Where are we going?
[31:04] Mama and Dad have agreed!
[31:06] That means that I can go with you….
[31:13] Hello, Chanda?
[31:16] Chanda, what has happened?
[31:17] What happened, Chanda, my child?
[31:19] Why are you crying? What did Shebi say?
[31:22] Here, give it to me.
[31:26] Hello?
[31:29] No, my son. Chanda’s health is completely okay.
[31:33] But what is it that you’ve said to her? She’s crying.
[31:37] I only told her that I was coming to pick her.
[31:43] What? Shebi, this…. Is a very happy news!
[31:51] Live long, my son! I have become very happy!
[31:57] Okay…. Alright.
[32:02] Uncle!
[32:04] My daughter, many congratulations to you!
[32:06] He’s coming to pick you up!
[32:09] You in laws have accepted you, yeah?
[32:13] You tears have brought colors.
[32:18] Here, now have some of it. Drink it! Drink.
[32:36] Why did you go to meet her! Why!
[32:40] You were strangling her!
[32:41] Yes, so she would’ve died!
[32:43] It would’ve been nice if the curse would’ve ended once and for all!
[32:46] What was she doing at uncle’s house?
[32:48] I’m asking, what she was doing at uncle’s house!
[32:50] Shahab is convincing his parents….
[32:52] Shahab can go to hell! I do not care about Shahab at all!
[32:55] Don’t be so cold hearted!
[32:57] I am cold hearted? I? Yes,
[32:59] your heart is very soft, right?
[33:01] That’s why you made her stay at uncles. Tell me!
[33:03] I did not know that she was at Muraad’s house! Muraad….
[33:06] What do I do! What do I do! I don’t understand anything! What do I do!
[33:11] What do I do?
[33:13] What do I do!
[33:15] You keep telling me not to get angry, that I should have control over myself!
[33:19] Do you not see what you’re doing?
[33:21] How will I control myself if you keep doing these things?
[33:26] Why don’t you forget about her! Why don’t you put mud over her!
[33:29] I am her mother!
[33:30] So aren’t you our mother?
[33:33] Are you only hers?
[33:34] Either you become her mother or ours!
[33:37] Stop it…
[33:38] How do I stop?
[33:40] How do I stop!
[33:42] How do I stop!
[33:44] But remember one thing, if dad finds out…
[33:46] Don’t you dare!
[33:47] You won’t tell him anything! He won’t be able to handle it!
[33:52] You really care about him?
[33:54] Then, why can’t we say this care?
[33:57] Why do you keep running to meet her?
[33:59] You won’t meet her now!
[34:03] Because if you do meet her now, I won’t listen to the worlds’ taunts!
[34:08] This time, I will take my own life!
[34:18] I won’t meet her!
[34:24] I promise. I won’t meet her.
[34:41] Mom kept meeting her and never made it obvious.
[34:47] She’s brought this new problem into our house.
[34:57] You were making me understand?
[34:59] You were making Ghafoor Counselor understand?
[35:01] Now your beloved is bringing that girl! He’ll make her sit on his head.
[35:05] He’ll make her sit on his head? My foot!
[35:08] You will see! You can change my name if I don’t make Shebi kick her out of this house!
[35:14] Change your name then!
[35:15] Shebi will kick that girl out?
[35:18] The one he was ready to leave the house for?
[35:19] I’ll kick her out of the house!
[35:21] He’s in love! Let her come. Then you’ll see what I do to her.
[35:29] You can’t do anything!
[35:31] He’s more of a lover than he is a son!
[35:32] And these family planning ads run just like that.
[35:35] Your daughter in law is pregnant! Listen to this!
[35:38] Baaji!
[35:39] The floral guy has decorated the entire room.
[35:41] What else is there to do?
[35:42] Oh, let’s listen to her!
[35:43] Tell him to bring the flowers and put them on my head!
[35:46] Why are you standing here now? Should I go?
[35:47] I am going, I am going.
[35:49] What are you doing?
[35:51] You’ll ruin the entire game if you keep getting mad like this!
[35:53] What is there to get ruined?
[35:55] What is there to get ruined?
[35:56] He took someone’s daughter, ran away and got married!
[35:59] What about Ghafoor Counselors reputation?
[36:02] He’s ruined it!
[36:04] I told him I won’t accept the girl but now?
[36:08] Don’t worry! I’ll play such game that the snake will die and even the stick won’t break!
[36:32] So now, the family politics will begin!
