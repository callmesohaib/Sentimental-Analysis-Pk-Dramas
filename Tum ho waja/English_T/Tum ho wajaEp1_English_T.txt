[01:29] Zain and Sitara, come and have your breakfast. Do finish your lunch today.
[01:35] Mother I finish it everyday. It’s Zain who doesn’t finish his lunch
[01:39] Mom, just give me lunch money.
[01:41] Why? You’re getting a healthy snack from home then what’s the need of eating unhealthy?
[01:45] All my friends buy their lunch from the canteen.
[01:48] Zain!
[01:49] You be quiet!
[01:50] Sahiba..
[01:51] Yes?
[01:52] Where’s my breakfast?
[01:53] It’s ready, you got a bit late
[01:55] Oh wow, thank you. Sitara, did you prepare him for his test?
[01:59] Yes, I did.
[01:59] Zain, I want a good result. You should get good marks.
[02:03] Yes abu.
[02:04] Inshallah he’ll get good marks. Oh no..
[02:07] This van driver..
[02:08] Then you should wake up early then.
[02:10] How is the van driver to be blamed? Did you take your lunch box?
[02:13] Khuda hafiz!
[02:15] You also be quick otherwise you’ll miss your buss.
[02:17] Listen, I’ll drop her. You warm up my tea or make another cup for me.
[02:26] Ami, please give me my clothes quickly, I’m getting late.
[02:32] Babar, one minute. I’ll take another pant out, this one is all torn.
[02:37] Pant? This was my new pant, how come it’s torn? Show me.
[02:39] Take a look..
[02:41] Mother, this jean isn’t torn, this is fashion,
[02:45] this jean is todays fashion. And who told you that jeans are supposed to be ironed?
[02:49] My jeans will get ruined. Just press my t-shirt, I’m getting very late. I’m going..
[02:53] Such a filthy fashion!
[02:56] Chanda, wake up!
[03:02] It’s 11 o clock. Go have your breakfast quickly, it’s on the table.
[03:07] So many clothes, I’m putting them beside the washing machine.
[03:11] Have your breakfast quickly and then wash the clothes in the washing machine. Come on!
[03:15] What is your problem mom?
[03:19] I can’t even sleep in my own house!
[03:23] I’m not a maid, I’m not washing any clothes. I don’t like washing clothes.
[03:28] I’m so sleepy..
[03:30] Don’t talk rubbish. Have your breakfast and start washing the clothes.
[03:37] Mr. Hafiz, what we need to do is that the lower floors needed around 300 doors
[03:46] and 600 windows according to the planning
[03:50] so we need to order their door frames meanwhile until this opens
[03:52] we’ll give the order for it later.
[03:53] For now we should give the order for their door frames.
[03:55] Alright fine but don’t worry about the quality like last time.
[04:00] Try to learn how to earn a few extra rupees.
[04:05] It’s better to earn some honest money rather
[04:07] than more dishonest money, that has more prosperity.
[04:38] Perfect! I’ll look the best.
[04:45] You have been preparing since yesterday, you still haven’t decided what you’ll wear at the mehndi?
[04:48] I decided long time ago. Look, I’ll wear this, I’ve matched the jewelry and the shoes also.
[04:55] Okay fine.
[04:56] Your father is about to reach, I’ve soaked the rice, go and cook them. I’m going to go pray.
[05:01] Oh no mom.. I just got done washing so many clothes. Tell Sitara, she’ll cook them.
[05:08] Sitara just got back from her college, she’ll do her assignment.
[05:11] What’s the big deal? It’ll only take 15 to 20 minutes.
[05:13] That’s it? Only 15 minutes?
[05:16] Then you can also do this very easily after praying. There’s nothing to be tensed about.
[05:21] Mom, if I’ll go to the kitchen right now then I’ll get tanned. I’ll do my facial right now, I’ll look more beautiful in the evening. I can’t go inside the kitchen..
[05:24] I’ll do my facial right now, I’ll look more beautiful in the evening. I can’t go inside the kitchen..
[05:30] You just need an excuse for not working. Do whatever you want.
[05:35] I swear I’m not making any excuses. After all I have to look nice in the evening.
[05:42] Omer!
[05:44] So Babar, how is your preparation going on?
[05:45] Come here, I’ll show you. The preparation is going great. Take a look at this design,
[05:50] I want this design to be our primary design and you listen to me…
[06:20] Did you iron my clothes?
[06:21] Yes sister, I just brought them.
[06:24] Okay. Hang them here somewhere, make sure their ironing doesn’t get ruined.
[06:29] Sister, I hanged them and brought them only and I’ve kept them on the sofa so that they don’t get creased.
[06:35] Oh no, you kept them on the sofa?
[06:37] Make sure no one sits on the sofa then otherwise they will get creased.
[06:41] Who will sit on your clothes? And it’s been half an hour, take these off.
[06:46] What are you doing? Let it be.
[06:48] I’ve gotten dark circles, I have to look fresh in the evening, pure beauty!
[06:54] You go. Why are you standing here?
[06:59] I am going api.
[07:01] Listen, take my shoes out of the cupboard.
[07:06] Clean them also, make sure they’re not dirty. I’ll wear them on my dress, they’ll look very nice.
[07:13] Sister, I do whatever you ask me to do
[07:17] but it will be better if you’ll tell me whatever that needs to be done all at once..
[07:20] No no, there’s no more work. You can relax and start preparing.
[07:26] Sure.
[07:30] You’re supposed to subtract..
[07:32] I don’t like the math teacher
[07:34] Because you don’t understand math
[07:37] Yes so I don’t understand it
[07:39] If you don’t understand it and fail then?
[07:41] Mom, look at what she’s saying..
[07:42] What kinds of things are you saying? God forbid.
[07:44] Did you have fun?
[07:45] You pass only because mom prays for you
[07:48] Yes so I pray for everyone.
[07:54] Who will add to this?
[07:56] Asalam o alikum..
[07:57] Walikum Salam..
[07:58] Dad, Asalam o alikum..
[08:00] Dad, Asalam o alikum..
[08:01] Walikum Salam
[08:02] Go freshen up, the children have been waiting since quiet some time..
[08:06] Sure, we’ll have lunch. Where’s Chanda?
[08:08] In her room..
[08:10] And has Babar not come back?
[08:11] He called, he said he’ll be late.
[08:13] I’m scared this boy will definitely do something wrong.
[08:17] Get up, serve food. Come on, leave this for now.
[08:21] Let him study mom, he doesn’t know anything.
[08:41] Hello Shebi!
[08:47] Why? I told you that I’ll message you when I’ll leave from my house.
[08:52] What’s wrong with you Shebi?
[08:54] The invitation is of 8 o clock.
[09:00] Yes, of course, why not.. do you know what mom has said?
[09:13] Here you go.
[09:15] This bitter medicine again. Till when will I have to keep eating it?
[09:18] Until you get better. The doctor has said you have to eat for fifteen days.
[09:21] I am absolutely fine. I don’t want to eat it anymore.
[09:24] Look at me,
[09:25] your face looks so dull.
[09:27] You didn’t sleep properly at night right?
[09:29] I would say you should rest for a while after having lunch.
[09:33] Thank you so much but I can’t rest.
[09:35] Work has been finished at the site, the finishing is going on. It’s important for me to be there.
[09:40] What does it matter if you rest only for a while Mansoor?
[09:42] It matters a lot.
[09:44] Tell me, It’s Mr. Tanveer’s daughters mehndi today right? What time do you have to go?
[09:52] We’ll go around 8 to 8.30
[09:54] I took out two thousand rupees. Put it in an envelope and give it to her.
[09:59] Asalam o alikum dad!
[10:00] Walikum Salam my Chanda princess! My doll! Oh no..
[10:08] I forgot!
[10:09] What do you do dad?
[10:11] Oh I am really sorry I forgot, I will give you money you can go and get it with your mother.
[10:15] No no no, what would mom know about male perfumes?
[10:19] Male perfume?
[10:21] It’s Malaika’s mehndi today mom so I’ll gift the groom a perfume.
[10:25] Why would you give the groom a perfume?
[10:27] Mom, all my friends are giving the groom something.
[10:30] If I don’t give him anything then they’ll make fun of me. I’ll do one thing, I won’t go!
[10:35] Hold on, one minute. I’ll go right now and I’ll get it.
[10:39] You sure?
[10:41] Yes for sure. Let’s go..
[10:43] Mansoor, what are you doing?
[10:45] Here we go, mom will not ruin the whole plan.
[10:47] Is this the way you should talk to your mother? Say sorry..
[10:53] You’ll bring it right?
[10:55] Yes now say sorry.
[10:57] Okay sorry mom..
[10:58] Let’s go have lunch now.
[11:24] Hero!
[11:26] Yes dad?
[11:26] Will you bring the roti or should I bring it?
[11:30] Dad, you seem quite hungry..
[11:33] Mr. Danish I’m talking about you. I’ve eaten.
[11:38] Dad, I’m not hungry. You rest, I’ll bring it later.
[11:42] Alright.
[11:46] Tell me, did you get your salary?
[11:48] I’ll get it in two to three days.
[11:51] What do you do Danish?
[11:53] It’s the third today, it’s still going to take two to three more days? To hell with such a job!
[12:00] They make the poor work so hard the whole month
[12:02] and they can’t even give the salary on the first of the month!
[12:06] Dad, I’ll the money in two to three days and you know how hard it is to find a new job these days.
[12:13] Mr. Danish don’t think less of yourself.
[12:18] You are not an ordinary man. You are a degree holder,
[12:22] what do they say? You have a marketing degree. They’ll hire you instantly!
[12:27] Dad, you’re absolutely right.
[12:29] If I don’t get the salary in two, three days then I will do what you’re saying. You don’t worry.
[12:34] Okay fine.
[12:36] I’ll go and get the roti then, okay? Close the door. And stop using your phone all the time.
[12:44] What is it? Why are you calling me again and again?
[12:47] Sitara is also getting ready in the room with me. If she finds out, she’ll tell ami.
[12:54] Shebi, what’s wrong with you? I’ll call you as soon as I reach, I promise. Let me get ready now.
[13:02] Lower the volume of the television Zain.
[13:04] Mom, he’ll lower the volume but I asked you for money
[13:07] I have told your father, he’ll give it day after tomorrow.
[13:09] I don’t need them day after tomorrow, I need them urgently
[13:11] and it’s not like I’m asking you for a loan, I am asking for my own money back.
[13:13] Please give them back to me.
[13:14] You’ll get them only if mom has them
[13:16] You be quiet, don’t talk in between. Mom please..
[13:20] I only have the money for the house expenses.
[13:22] Take it out from the expenses. That will be great, adjust it from the money dad gives you.
[13:25] Okay fine, take it from me in the morning. Let’s go.. one minute, show me your face..
[13:30] Yes?
[13:31] So much make up! Go lighten it up.
[13:35] No mom, the makeup is absolutely fine. It’s not even dark. I look so pretty.
[13:40] No no it doesn’t look nice.
[13:41] You look like a monkey.
[13:43] I never look nice to you ever anyways.
[13:46] Yes, I don’t like you at all.
[13:48] Chanda, go lighten up your makeup.
[13:50] Mom, I’m not going to lighten up my makeup.
[13:52] I’ve done such a nice makeup. You’re always after me for no reason
[13:56] Listen, you should obey mom sometimes.
[13:58] You obey her right? That’s enough.
[14:00] I also obey her sometimes, things which are meant to be obeyed.
[14:03] Then why aren’t you obeying to this?
[14:05] And listen, you know what your problem is?
[14:08] Dad has spoilt you, there’s nothing else other than this.
[14:10] Oh so you don’t like that?
[14:13] Obviously. I dislike you so I would obviously dislike that.
[14:15] And mom, make her understand, if she’ll talk back then that won’t be good for her.
[14:18] No no what?
[14:20] Api, your absolutely right.
[14:22] Right?
[14:22] That’s enough now! Stop it.
[14:25] Chanda, go and fix yourself.
[14:28] Go put a scarf on yourself and call Sitara.
[14:31] Alright okay.
[14:32] Go.
[14:34] Listen, all three of you have dinner when your dad comes. Lower down it’s volume.
[14:39] Look at what mom is saying, does anyone lower down the volume
[14:41] when they’re watching a match.
[14:42] Brother, get me a burger.
[14:45] Have you lost it? You think you deserve a burger?
[14:48] Please, bring one. Only one, we’ll share it.
[18:56] What was the need for you to bring me a present?
[18:58] Why? You buy me so many presents yourself. Can't I give you one too?
[19:05] If it was in my hands,
[19:08] I would get you each and everything from around the world and put it in your feet.
[19:16] Really? Open the present.
[19:21] Okay.
[19:23] Okay.
[19:31] How is it?
[19:33] My favorite cologne! Thank you.
[19:39] Alright now tell me, where do you want to go for dinner?
[19:42] Dinner?
[19:43] No, no, no. I don't have that much time.
[19:45] If the event has finished and mother finds out that I'm not around, she will create a scene.
[19:48] I'm going to go now. Okay bye!
[19:55] Why do you get so scared?
[20:02] You have your dad. Doesn't he speak in your favor?
[20:06] You have your dad. Doesn't he speak in your favor?
[20:09] Yes, he does talk in my favor. But sometimes, he comes under mothers influence
[20:11] and when that happens, mother also gets an excuse to talk.
[20:14] That’s why, I can't stay any longer. Alright? Okay.
[20:32] Mother! Where is Chanda Appi?
[20:34] I myself have been looking for her since so long. Where has she gone?
[20:37] You have been looking for her too? She's not here. She might be inside with her friends.
[20:41] Go find her. We have to go home. It's getting late.
[20:44] Okay. Let me see.
[21:05] Yes so what have you decided about your education?
[21:08] There is still time. If you wish, you can start over.
[21:12] No, father. It is too late now. It will be very difficult now.
[21:16] Alright. So it is decided that you will pursue with the tailoring business?
[21:23] Not a tailor. Designer.
[21:26] It is the same thing. You may hold your ear this way or that way.
[21:30] What you are saying is right but in this field, whoever works hard gets fame as well as wealth.
[21:44] This money is not everything.
[21:46] Education blesses a person with pride.
[21:51] A person may not have anything good to eat
[21:55] but life is something that is spent well when you have your pride.
[22:01] These are all bookish talks.
[22:05] Anyway those who don't eat well, the world kicks them on the ground.
[22:12] These days, the ones who have wealth are the only ones who are treated with respect.
[22:17] That isn't called respect, my son. That's called flattering.
[22:19] And you will only find those who flatter, around the wealthy.
[22:23] Not the respectable ones.
[22:26] Anyway, it is up to you.
[22:30] May God bless you with success. Yes, this prince of mine will become an engineer.
[22:36] No, no father. Pilot.
[22:39] He will become a pilot!
[22:41] To become a pilot, you need to study. You can't just become a pilot without doing anything.
[22:51] Greetings, father.
[22:52] Greetings. What happened? What took you so long?
[22:58] Actually, my friend’s driver had to drop me. That’s why it took longer to reach back home.
[23:01] Alright, okay. You enjoyed right?
[23:03] A lot! I had a great time. And everyone complimented my look so much telling me how pretty I looked.
[23:07] But you never told me what you thought about it?
[23:09] Alright then stand up and show me what you look like.
[23:11] Look!
[23:12] Ma Sha Allah, Ma Sha Allah! May god give you a healthy life. You look very beautiful.
[23:16] Do you know there was so much to eat over there
[23:20] that I couldn't make up my mind on what to eat. I had a wholesome meal!
[23:24] This is decided. It is not possible that my daughter does not enjoy the food, am I right?
[23:28] Now go, get changed and rest. Go. You also have your school tomorrow, go, it's very late.
[23:38] Hold on one minute, Sebi. Did you get the chance to meet Mujeed and his waiter?
[23:44] Why? Did a fight take place?
[23:46] As if! What is his value that he’d fight with me?
[23:49] He is turning poor people against me, this father and his son.
[23:55] Saying that I did not fulfill my promises.
[23:59] What do you think?
[24:00] Just because he said something,
[24:01] do you think these people are going to stand in front of us and ask us for answers?
[24:04] They don’t even have the guts to look straight into your eyes and talk to you.
[24:08] You are stressing over this for nothing. I have been trying to explain this to you since so long.
[24:12] My son, if they gather the courage to talk in front of me, I will have to teach them a lesson, no?
[24:17] So why are you worrying about this?
[24:19] You are not of their caliber and you don’t need to communicate with them.
[24:23] I am here, right? I’ll look into it, I will handle it.
[24:26] My youngster!
[24:27] My son, my prince! Do one thing. Keep all of this. And also donate it to someone. Go!
[24:39] Bye!
[24:42] Enjoy life! See, after all whose son is he!
[24:45] I just hope no evil eye be on him.
[24:47] You are also wearing a very nice color today. Do I look alright?
[24:49] Yes.
[24:50] Yes.
[24:58] Mother was getting very worried when you weren't there.
[25:02] What do you mean by when I wasn't there? I was there only. Mother has a habit of getting worried.
[25:21] Whose call was it?
[25:23] What is it to you? Why do you care whoever's was it.
[25:34] It's ringing again.
[25:39] You, stop acting like my mother. Understand?
[25:43] You don't take our mother as a mother even. What am I to you.
[25:48] Oh, yes!
[25:50] You have told me a very nice thing. And you are a very obedient daughter to your mother, right?
[25:56] Alright now, go to sleep.
[25:57] You have to wake up in the morning, make breakfast, and do the chores as well. Right?
[26:00] Go, go to sleep. Goodnight. Go to sleep.
[26:14] Yes. Now speak.
[26:19] You have no idea, Shahab.
[26:22] The way I met you today, anything could have happened. I was really scared.
[26:28] What is there to be scared about? I'm here with you.
[26:32] You are there. That's the only reason why I’m so strong.
[26:35] But you know what?
[26:37] Mother was very angry today. I'm just scared she might say something absurd to father.
[26:44] Something absurd? What do you mean by that?
[26:47] I have a feeling that mother has a suspicion on me.
[26:50] Alright then make her believe the fact that we love each other.
[26:55] If not today then tomorrow, everyone is going to find out. Why not today, then?
[27:00] Chanda!
[27:04] Hello?
[27:07] Who are you talking to, standing here, so late at night?
[27:10] Umm..  Shamsa called, mother.
[27:15] This late at night?
[27:18] Yes. She couldn't attend the ceremony today. So she called to ask who all was there,
[27:24] what all we had done. I was telling her that only.
[27:27] Hmm. Where did you disappear to while we were there?
[27:31] Me? Where would I disappear? I was there only.
[27:37] We looked for you inside the entire house. Sitara and I kept looking for you.
[27:40] We couldn't find you anywhere.
[27:41] No, no. Actually, I went to Nida's room.
[27:44] You weren't there inside Nida's room either. Sitara went and checked. You weren't there!
[27:48] Sitara was telling a lie. I don’t know what rivalry she has with me.
[27:52] Alright. Don't talk rubbish. Where did you go? Tell me.
[27:59] Tell me! Where did you go?
[28:01] Mother, are you doubting me?
[28:06] Where would I go? I was there only. You should... Let me wake father up.
[28:14] Wait a minute. There is no need for you to wake your father up at this hour.
[28:19] You will wake your father up at this hour and distraught him. Go and sleep.
[28:23] I will sleep.
[28:25] Come on.
[28:31] Oh God! Keep my daughter under your safety. I hope she doesn't walk on any wrong path.
[28:45] You did not do the right thing getting a phone for Chanda.
[28:49] Why not? All the youngsters these days carry a phone with them in their hands.
[28:52] If I hadn't gotten it for her, she would've fallen into an inferior complex.
[28:56] You're not trying to understand what I’m saying.
[28:59] I understand, I understand. She is always on the phone, she keeps talking to her friends.
[29:04] She has started dressing up a little.
[29:06] And you, you want her to be responsible in the house chores. What else?
[29:10] Mansoor,
[29:13] after a certain age, we have to show some strictness to our children. It is necessary.
[29:18] Look, I cannot be strict with Chanda.
[29:24] And if someone else does the same, I do not like it.
[29:28] You do know that she is my favorite.
[29:31] She came into this world three years after our marriage.
[29:34] And after she was born, our life had transformed for the better.
[29:40] Remember how this one time when she fell sick, we took her and rushed to the hospital?
[29:46] She got so many injections, so many drips.
[29:52] Even then, The Almighty wanted her to survive. And what's left now? She has grown up.
[29:59] She'll go to her own house once she gets married.
[30:04] I hope that prosperous day comes soon.
[30:08] You are worried for her for no reason.
[30:11] Oh yeah! Muraad called.
[30:13] I have to stop by him on my way to work. I wonder what is it that he needs to talk about.
[30:16] Pass me my bag. Allah Hu Akbar!
[30:35] Actually, bhai sahib... Danish has started a new job.
[30:42] We have no idea about when he gets paid.
[30:45] For last month's expenditure, I took a loan of five thousand from someone else.
[30:52] And that person keeps banging my door to ask for his money back. It is very embarrassing for me.
[30:57] You should have told me this before, when I was leaving my house. Right now I..
[31:01] Bhai sahib, if you could manage anything..
[31:06] Neither do you look at the time nor..
[31:09] Wajid Sahib has constantly been calling me, I have to go and meet him as well. You..
[31:14] go home. Ask your sister in law for it. I'll tell her. Go, take it from her.
[31:20] Bhai sahib, your bag.
[31:24] Yes, yes. I'm coming. Alright.
[31:31] He will never give it on his own. Every time, I’m told to go and beg that woman for it.
[31:40] And she sits on top of the treasure like a snake. I wonder when I will get rid of her.
[31:52] Will you always be stuck to your phone? Your eyes will get weak.
[31:54] Go and do the chores. Go to the kitchen and cook today.
[31:58] Aunt Zohra is coming over. She has found a proposal for you. It’s a nice motherly.
[32:01] They will be coming over in a day or two.
[32:04] Hold on, one minute. Who has said to you that I will get married?
[32:08] That also, to a guy that she has found for me? Never ever.
[32:11] What do you mean?
[32:13] Am I supposed to look for a proposal for you when someone tells me to?
[32:15] I am your mother. Should I not be worried for you?
[32:19] My beautiful mother! You call her right here and right now and refuse.
[32:24] I don’t want to get married.
[32:27] And yes. If I do get married, I will get married to the guy of my own choice.
[32:32] What? What are you saying? Come here.
[32:35] Asalam o alikum, uncle!
[32:35] Walikum Salam, live long, uncle’s darling. What happened?
[32:42] Look! Look at what mother's saying.
[32:45] What happened, sister in law? Why are you scolding my daughter?
[32:49] She's saying she won't get married.
[32:51] Oh, alright.
[32:55] Uncle, I will make you the best tea.
[32:59] Along with some hot and fresh savories. Please, make mother understand. Please.
[33:05] Are you sure?
[33:07] Thank you,
[33:10] Sister in law, seems as if a proposal has come.
[33:13] Proposal will come only if I talk to someone. And that can only happen only when she agrees.
[33:17] Oh sister in law! What’s wrong? She’s a child right now. We have a lot of time.
[33:22] Daughter's as soon as they grow up should be married
[33:24] and sent off to their own homes with respect. That's what’s best, Muraad.
[33:26] You are absolutely right.
[33:28] But these two daughters of yours are the stars of our household.
[33:33] Let them live their lives on their own terms for a few days.
[33:36] After that, they have to get married anyway.
[33:39] Muraad, neither you will understand nor your elder brother.
[33:43] Alright.
[33:46] Sister in law, elder brother has told me to take five thousand rupees from you.
[33:53] If you want, you may call and ask him.
[33:56] No, no. If you are saying it, you must be telling the truth.
[33:59] Alright, so.. Sister in law, please give them to me.
[34:05] The person that I have to return them to must be waiting for me.
[34:09] Alright, I’ll bring them.
[34:18] It kills this woman to give me my brothers earned money.
[34:32] Yay, I won!
[34:34] Win this time and then I will believe you.
[34:36] Mother, you are praying that I win, right?
[34:39] I'm not going to make a prayer for this silly game.
[34:41] Did you see? Even mother won't pray for this.
[34:44] Father is here. Asalam alikum father.
[34:46] Walikum Salam
[34:49] What is this that you have brought? A burger?
[34:50] Yes. I know that you guys love it. That's why I bought it for you.
[34:52] Give it to me. Let me dish it out.
[34:53] Go, go. Bring it.
[34:54] What was the need for this? There was food at home.
[34:57] Sometimes, it looks nice. They are kids. They get happy.
[35:01] Alright, listen. Wajid Sahaab has gotten two new big contracts.
[35:06] This is a very happy news.
[35:09] And here you go. This, have brought for you.
[35:14] I love corsages so much, father.
[35:17] Girls don't wear corsages.
[35:19] So what did you get for me then?
[35:21] For you, I have brought this.
[35:25] Greetings, uncle.
[35:25] Oh look. Mr. Danish is here.
[35:28] Greetings Aunt, greetings Chanda. How are you?
[35:31] I'm fine.
[35:34] Chanda..
[35:34] You tell me how is your work going?
[35:36] All well with God’s grace and your blessings.
[35:38] Come, sit. Come here.
[35:50] Asalam o alikum!
[35:52] You're here, Muraad king. Now we can bet.
[35:59] So, is the bet ready?
[36:00] How much do you guys have in your pockets?
[36:02] Uncle’s pocket has nothing in it, as usual.
[36:07] Who all is winning?
[36:11] Listen, Muraad is here. Now only Muraad is going to win.
[36:14] Bring it on. And the first bet will be of 500!
[36:26] You asked me to make tea for you and you're standing here. Here, take this.
[36:30] It’s very hot, be careful.
[36:32] Listen..
[36:33] Yes?
[36:34] Actually, I am...
[36:35] Make it fast. I have to go back to the kitchen, there's plenty of dishes.
[36:37] I have to fix my room as well. There's a lot of work.
[36:39] I was saying..
[36:41] What? Say it already. Quickly. I have a lot of work pending.
[36:44] Actually, I wanted to get a present for you.
[36:45] A present? What's the occasion?
[36:48] I got my first paycheck. So I thought, why not get you a present from it?
[36:52] Oh! So... I want a college bag, a football for Zain, some make up stuff for sister..
[36:59] Sssh! I'm only asking you about what you want? I'll get you a bag. But apart from that?
[37:06] What else?
[37:07] And I want a lot of chocolates, I want ice cream as well and tomorrow, I want a treat with Zain.
[37:29] No, no. Tomorrow isn't possible at all. Nothing can happen tomorrow.
[37:34] Here, I’m going crazy in your love and you keep saying not yet, not yet? I'm getting furious now!
[37:42] Really? You have never been angry in front of me before.
[37:47] I’m telling you, tomorrow is impossible for me. Let’s pick a day for next week.
[37:54] Next week?
[37:55] Alright. But I have a condition.
[37:58] You will have lunch with me, we'll hang out in the evening and we will go watch a movie at night, too.
[38:03] We will do as you wish. And listen, Shahab.
[38:11] If I don’t get you, I will die.
[38:16] God forbid! I will talk to my parents for your proposal. I will send them to your house.
[38:22] Are you sure?
[38:41] I love you more than anyone else. Have all the apples. Should I cut more of them?
[38:46] Zain! Go and rest in your room.
[38:51] Listen! Take these. And have all of the apples.
[39:03] Would you like some?
[39:05] Who were you speaking to on the phone last night?
[39:09] Me?
[39:16] no one?
[39:19] Who is Shahab?
