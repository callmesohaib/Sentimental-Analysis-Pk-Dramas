[00:55] He cut my call!
[00:57] I’ll leave him a message. 
[01:08] I’m at the assemblage, I’ll talk to you later.
[01:10] Oh God! What should I do?
[01:19] Yes, dad? I am coming. I have picked the cash.
[01:23] You don’t want it anymore? I am coming in two minutes.
[01:51] Assalam o Alaikum!
[01:53] How are you?
[01:57] I got the money.
[02:00] I don’t know how to thank you.
[02:04] Yes, I am going to the hospital only. 
[02:06] Come directly over there.
[02:08] Done, done, done.
[02:09] We’ll meet over there.
[02:11] Okay. Okay. Okay. Khuda Hafiz! 
[02:25] Wait, wait, wait! Stop the bike, you!
[02:28] Take out your wallet!
[02:28] Take out your mobile, fast! 
[02:30] One minute.. I am giving it..
[02:30] Take out your wallet! Take out your wallet! Fast!
[02:35] What is this that you’re hiding? Take it out!
[02:37] It’s nothing…
[02:37] Take it out!
[02:37] It’s nothing..
[02:39] Take it out!
[02:40] Let this be. This is money for my brother’s treatment! 
[02:42] Let’s go! Let’s go!
[02:42] Please! I need this money very urgently, it’s for my brother’s treatment!
[03:25] Is everything okay? What are you doing here?
[03:26] Brother isn’t picking up the phone. His phone is going off. He hasn’t come yet! 
[03:30] Don’t worry, he’ll be here. I have brought 40 thousand rupees, I am going to get it deposited.
[03:35] As soon as he comes, send him to me.
[03:39] Why has she come here?
[03:44] What has happened to Zain?
[03:46] Is he feeling alright? 
[03:48] Who told you?
[03:51] Uncle called me and told me.
[03:53] Where is he? I want to meet him. 
[03:59] You can’t meet him
[04:01] and neither are you allowed to see him. 
[04:08] Why? 
[04:12] Because I’m telling you. That’s why.
[04:15] Alright! Don’t tell me.
[04:19] I will go and find out myself!
[04:22] There’s no need for you to cause a scene over here.
[04:24] You have already caused a lot of drama in our lives.
[04:26] Neither will I let you cause a scene now nor will I let you meet Zain! 
[04:30] One minute. One minute. One minute.
[04:33] Who are you to stop me?
[04:35] He’s my brother!
[04:36] I have all the rights! 
[04:37] I also have my rights on him! 
[04:39] You have lost all your rights because of your mistakes! 
[04:43] Make her understand! 
[04:45] Sitara is absolutely right. 
[04:48] Oh! You too?
[04:52] I have no interest in talking to you guys.
[04:56] Call mom. I want to talk to her. 
[04:59] You can’t talk to mom either
[05:02] and you also can’t meet her.
[05:03] Say whatever you have to say to me or go away from here! 
[05:08] There’s no need for you to get so hyper!
[05:10] You guys need money right now. I came to give you that!
[05:13] Call mom! Don’t you understand this? 
[05:16] Really? You’ll give us the money and win our hearts back?
[05:21] What do you think you’ll give us your money and we’ll forgive all your mistakes and all your sins? 
[05:27] We aren’t greedy for money!
[05:28] You were the one who was greedy for money because of whom all of this has happened! 
[05:32] Now you keep this money saved! You will have the money but you won’t have us! 
[05:37] Sitara! 
[05:47] You’ve started to talkback now.
[05:51] I am only talking for now, I also know how to raise my hand and now,
[05:59] I won’t show any consideration anymore.
[06:07] The path of life that you have chosen for yourself, keep walking on that.
[06:16] And for god sake, don’t show us your face! Go from here!
[06:26] Fine. That’s fine. I will remember what you did today for the rest of my life.
[06:37] I will always remember..
[06:57] Bhai! Got a call from the reception.
[06:59] They were saying that we need to deposit 2 and a half lacs as soon as possible..
[07:01] If I had any jewelry..
[07:03] What kind of an uncle am I? I don’t have money for my blood, my nephew..
[07:07] Babar, don’t worry..
[07:08] Everything else combine has cost this much. What will happen now?
[07:33] What does Sitara think of herself?
[07:38] She didn’t even let me meet Zain.
[07:44] God knows in what condition the poor thing must be in, how he must be feeling..
[07:50] I’ll call uncle..
[08:01] Chanda.. You wretched woman, you should have called before coming here.
[08:09] She ruined everything!
[08:13] He cut my call..
[08:28] He switched off his phone..
[08:37] Please relax Sitara in fact have water..
[08:44] My brother shouldn’t find out that Chanda came here..
[08:51] What happened? Why are you two standing here?
[08:55] Dad, did you tell Chanda about what happened?
[09:03] What? Chanda came here?
[09:05] When you knew it wasn’t appropriate for her to come here then why did you tell her?
[09:09] Why are you repeating Chanda Chanda again and again?
[09:12] I didn’t call her here on purpose.
[09:15] She called me herself, so we were talking and I told her.
[09:20] if she came here then how is it my fault?
[09:22] I don’t understand why every good deed of mine backfires.
[09:26] What happened? What is it?
[09:28] What do I tell you..
[09:29] Actually we were talking about Babar, he hasn’t reached yet.
[09:33] Call him, try to find out.
[09:35] I did, his phone is switched off.
[09:39] It’s off..
[09:40] Please don’t worry, he’ll come soon.
[09:46] Danish, you went to get the money..
[09:50] Yes dad, here’s the money.
[09:54] Good boy!
[09:56] Let’s go and get it deposited.
[09:57] I’ll come along. You go sit with Zain. If Babar comes, send him to us.
[10:05] Please come..
[10:18] Babar.. Please go back!
[10:26] Yes, right here.
[10:29] One minute..
[10:31] Babar sir, why are you sitting here like this?
[10:34] I’ll tell you everything. Please give me your phone, I have to make an important call.
[10:38] My phone got switched off because the battery got low.
[10:41] What has happened? Umer sir was telling me your brother is hospitalized.
[10:45] My brother is in the hospital.
[10:47] I had arranged the money with a lot of difficulty for his treatment
[10:49] but they got snatched from me.
[10:52] I don’t know how will he get his treatment done.. How will I return that money..
[10:57] I don’t know what to do..
[11:04] Babar sir, don’t worry. The money will get arranged.
[11:12] How?
[11:19] Mam this is a private hospital, I can’t do anything about it.
[11:22] You’ll have to pay the money no matter what.
[11:24] You guys are creating such a big issue!
[11:26] When we are telling you that the money will get deposited then it will!
[11:28] Danish, is this how you’re supposed to talk?
[11:32] Move, move away. I’ll speak to him.
[11:36] I apologies, he’s a child.
[11:38] Look, my nephew is admitted here. It’s not like we’ll run away.
[11:43] Please take this money, we’ll deposit the remaining money as well.
[11:48] Asalam o alikum sir.
[11:49] Talk to him, he’s our head of finance, he can help you out.
[11:56] Alright.
[11:59] Asalam o alikum sir.
[12:00] Walikum Salam.
[12:01] This is my sister in law, she’s a widow so we’re having some money problems.
[12:09] We had deposited 30 thousand rupees, we want to deposit 50 thousand more.
[12:15] We’ll deposit the rest of the money in a while also, my nephew has gone to get the money.
[12:20] Till when will you get it deposited? How much time will it take?
[12:23] We’ll need some time. It will only take a few hours. We’ll be very thankful to you.
[12:28] Alright. Sign the undertaking. Get it signed from them.
[12:32] Yes sir.
[12:34] If you don’t get the money deposited on time
[12:36] then the hospital administration can take a legal action against you.
[12:43] What kind of legal action?
[12:45] Our board takes the decision for that.
[13:09] Asalam o alikum.
[13:10] Shebi, you were getting worried for nothing. Chanda’s back..
[13:14] Walikum Salam..
[13:16] Where did you go?
[13:19] Actually.. Shahab.. I went to the hospital, Zain wasn’t well…
[13:25] I had asked you not to go but you still went?
[13:28] You did ask me not to go but I had to go.
[13:32] Uncle kept calling, Zain was really not well and they needed money so..
[13:36] Money?
[13:42] Chanda, show me your bag..
[13:43] No! No! Mama..
[13:44] Show it to me for one second.. What’s the problem in showing it to me..
[13:47] Let me see!
[14:00] So much money..
[14:08] Shebi, you must have given them to her right?
[14:11] Her uncle must have given her the money, right? Your uncle gave them to you?
[14:16] Tell me, give me an answer. Where did this money come from?
[14:21] I took it from the money you kept in the drawer..
[14:27] Oh my god!
[14:28] Oh my god!
[14:30] You stole?
[14:31] I didn’t steal.
[14:34] Didn’t you feel ashamed?
[14:35] You stole from your own house?
[14:37] What’s wrong with you? Who steals from their own house?
[14:41] If you needed the money, you could have asked me, I would have given it to you.
[14:43] Why are you accusing me off stealing?
[14:45] I am telling you I didn’t steal! Why will I steal?
[14:47] Behave yourself! Look at the way you’re speaking to mama.
[14:49] You talk to me softly. Is this the way to talk in front of everyone?
[14:52] Didn’t you feel ashamed you stole from your own house, from your own husband?
[14:55] What’s wrong with you? Who steals from their own husband?
[14:58] They money was there so I took it, that isn’t stealing!
[15:01] I didn’t steal! Why don’t you understand?
[15:04] That money wasn’t mine, it was dad’s, he had given them to me for some work!
[15:07] Be quiet now! Enough! Enough. Enough of this drama now. Nobody will speak now.
[15:12] Look, she has no respect for us, she also has no respect for you.
[15:16] She will keep meeting them even if you keep stopping her.
[15:18] She will go, she can’t leave her family but she can leave this family though.
[15:21] Enough of this now. You two make arrangements for yourself now.
[15:22] Enough of this now. You two make arrangements for yourself now.
[15:28] Come with me.
[15:31] Where are you taking me? Leave me.
[15:32] Shebi..
[15:35] Such a fire has been sparked now that he won’t keep her here anymore.
[15:44] Stealing? You should get an Oscar for that.
[16:04] Sitara, try one more time.
[16:08] He might have switched on his phone.
[16:13] If we don’t deposit the money on time then what will happen?
[16:17] I think if we don’t deposit the money on time then they might stop Zain’s treatment
[16:23] and I don’t know how the hospital administration takes legal actions, god knows what…
[16:31] It’s all for money. Money makes the mare go.
[16:43] Money is very important.
[16:46] If I was earning well then I wouldn’t have let anyone getting worried.
[16:52] I’ll go to Dubai, I’ll earn a lot of money.
[16:58] Come here!
[17:00] I can’t face my parents because of you!
[17:03] When I had asked you not to meet your family then why did you go?
[17:06] And you also stole!
[17:07] I didn’t steal because I would have never brought back the money!
[17:10] Keep your voice down!
[17:12] Already such a huge scene was caused because of you!
[17:14] And taking money without permission is called stealing!
[17:16] I did call you, you didn’t pick up my call!
[17:19] I had told you in the morning so why can’t you understand?
[17:23] Why do you not understand? He’s my brother! He wasn’t well!
[17:27] If you cared so much about his condition
[17:29] then why didn’t you feel sorry for him when you ran away to get married with me!
[17:32] I was mad! I was mad! I had lost it! I regret it!
[17:37] I am only regretting the fact that I married you!
[17:41] You’re regretting?
[17:45] Leave me!
[17:46] You will start regretting now. You will get to know when I’ll teach you a lesson!
[17:52] Stay in this room now!
[18:08] So what happened?
[18:11] Did they agree?
[18:14] No aunty. They’re not ready to give us more time
[18:19] Did you find out anything about Babar?
[18:22] I can’t seem to find out about Babar also, his phone is switched off.
[18:34] Umer, this is Babar’s mom speaking. Where is Babar?
[18:40] No, he hasn’t reached here yet.
[18:43] I hope he’s not in some kind of trouble.
[18:47] Let me know as soon as you find out.
[18:52] Aunty, what is Umer saying?
[18:56] I don’t know how to get out of this problem.
[18:59] One child of mine is sick and the other one is stuck god knows where..
[19:08] Aunty, don’t worry.
[19:11] Everything will be fine. I’ll go get water for you.
[19:19] I don’t understand these hospital people. They’ve created such a problem for us.
[19:26] God knows where our poor Babar must be roaming helplessly around for the money.
[19:38] Bhabhi Jee, believe me.
[19:44] You only have one way out of this.
[19:49] What?
[19:53] We aren’t sure whether Babar would bring all of the amount or not.
[19:59] You… ask Wajid Sahib for the money.
[20:04] Never!
[20:07] Bhabhi Sahiba, if you have any other way then tell me.
[20:11] I won’t ask Wajid for money!
[20:14] I have dialed his number. You talk to him.
[20:16] Bhabhi Sahiba, it is very important.
[20:19] Wajid Sahib has picked up the phone. You talk to him.
[20:24] Hello. Assalam o Alaikum, Bhai Sahib. It’s me, Sahiba speaking.
[20:30] Bhabhi, you? Is everything alright?
[20:34] Nothing is fine!
[20:36] Why, what happened?
[20:37] Zain wasn’t feeling well so we brought him to the hospital.
[20:40] The doctor said he needs to be operated as soon as possible!
[20:43] Oh, alright…
[20:45] The operation is done but…
[20:48] Babar has gone to arrange the money but we haven’t been able to find anything out about it!
[20:53] Alright. I’ll come.
[20:56] Thank you very much!
[21:10] The path of life that you have chosen for yourself, keep walking on that.
[21:18] And for god sake, don’t show us your face!
[21:27] If you cared so much about his condition
[21:29] then why didn’t you feel sorry for him when you ran away to get married with me!
[22:12] Look at him yourself! The condition that my son is in!
[22:17] Nothing. Nothing has happened to my son.
[22:20] He’s going through a difficulty in life.
[22:23] He’ll face it like a man! He’s my lion. Lion! Yeah?
[22:27] Do one thing. Get up! Let’s go out for a walk, let’s go have a meeting or two!
[22:33] Come on!
[22:36] Come, my lion.
[22:45] Wajid Sahib, I don’t know how to thank you.
[22:50] If you hadn’t given this money then….
[22:54] Look, I don’t just have business relations with Mansoor but he is like a brother to me.
[23:00] I could help his family in some way. What’s a bigger happiness than that?
[23:06] Ma Sha Allah! This is your greatness otherwise who does that in times like these?
[23:14] Alright. Let these talks be. Tell me, where is Babar? I don’t see him anywhere.
[23:19] Where would that poor kid go? He had also just went to make arrangements for the money.
[23:26] Mom!
[23:31] Zain is calling you inside.
[23:38] You go inside, I’ll come.
[23:49] Bhai Sahib, I wanted to thank you once again.
[23:54] If you’re going to keep thanking me again and again like this, you’ll embarrass me.
[23:59] Anyway, I’ll get going now. If you need anything at all, let me know. Alright?
[24:07] Come. I’ll walk you out.
[24:24] Where has he gone!
[24:31] Will the matter get solved if he doesn’t talk to me?
[24:49] Chanda!
[24:53] The girl won’t leave him easily!
[24:58] Hello! Where are you?
[25:00] Shebi’s father speaking!
[25:04] Uncle, connect me with Shahab!
[25:06] He cannot talk right now, he’s busy.
[25:08] I have to talk to him about something very important!
[25:09] Can you please connect me with him?
[25:11] The son and father are out for a ride.
[25:14] Can’t you see them happy? Don’t call again and again. Do you understand?
[25:17] You listen to me….
[25:20] Hello?
[26:08] You’re back, my son?
[26:09] Yes, dad.
[26:11] Alright! After the meeting, we both father and son will go out for lunch.
[26:15] Dad…
[26:15] Oh, nothing! Everything will be fine! Let’s go!
[26:22] Dad, you go and rest at home. We are here, we’ll take care of everything.
[26:28] Uncle! I have arranged the money! Come, let’s get the money deposited…
[26:31] The money has been arranged, Babar Bhai. You don’t get worried.
[26:35] The money has been deposited? What do you mean?
[26:39] I did whatever I could from my side.
[26:43] Where were you!
[26:45] I’ll tell you that later. You tell me, where did the money come from?
[26:48] Abu’s friend, Wajid Sahib gave it.
[26:53] You took money from Wajid Sahib?
[26:55] Why did you take money from Wajid Sahib when I had told you I would arrange it?
[26:59] Don’t you trust me?
[27:01] I do trust you but…
[27:04] But what? How long did I take to return that you guys couldn’t wait for me?
[27:09] Babar bhai, everything is in front of you.
[27:12] There had come so many difficulties over here that Aunt didn’t even have any other solution either.
[27:18] Yes.
[27:20] And Babar, if Bhabhi Jee hadn’t called Wajid Sahib
[27:26] then this hospital’s staff would’ve left our Zain’s operation in the middle and kicked us out.
[27:32] And you tell me yourself, how long would we have waited for you?
[27:36] Till the time I hadn’t come back! Till then!
[27:37] Look at this. There’s money in my hands!
[27:40] And you think of it yourself, dad never asked for money favors from Wajid Sahib in all his life.
[27:46] What must Wajid Sahib be thinking?
[27:48] That a dignified man like dad has such an irresponsible son?
[27:52] Babar! Babar. Money can be returned but if god forbid, something had happened to Zain…
[27:57] You’re forgetting that Zain is also my younger brother and I had taken full responsibility of him.
[28:04] The thing is that uncle, on my way to the hospital, snatcher’s looted me.
[28:09] Even then, I arranged this amount again!
[28:12] What?
[28:15] Nothing has happened to you, right?
[28:16] No need to worry too much about me because in reality, you don’t! Tell me, where is Zain?
[28:22] In the room...
[28:53] Sitara?
[28:59] How is he?
[29:03] How is my brother feeling?
[29:04] Bhai, I am fine.
[29:08] Dad came in my dream.
[29:11] He was very tensed.
[29:14] He also kept loving me again and again.
[29:17] He was saying to me that in place of him, you’re my father now.
[29:23] You won’t leave us, right?
[29:27] What are you saying, Zain?
[29:33] Dad has left but I am here in his place. I will never leave you.
[29:42] Bhai, I won’t die. Right?
[29:45] What’s has happened to you, Zain?
[29:49] You’re my champ! Nothing will happen to you.
[29:52] Come on now. Don’t think too much. Take a rest.
[30:15] Where were you?
[30:21] I went to arrange the money.
[30:27] Don’t they say that when the time is bad for you, nothing goes right?
[30:34] That’s what happened.
[30:38] On my way back, snatcher’s looted me on gun point.
[30:43] What would I have done?
[30:47] I had to bring the money.
[30:51] Then the same helplessness.
[30:55] I did arrange the money again but….
[31:01] I don’t know when my bad time will end.
[31:17] Chanda Aapi had come.
[31:24] Why? Why did she come here now?
[31:31] To buy our helplessness with her money. She came to give money.
[31:43] Who called her here? Mom?
[31:46] No, not mom. She was saying that uncle called and told her.
[31:49] This uncle!
[31:54] Already, he made mom call Wajid Sahib and got him to deposit the money over here!
[32:02] We have been shamed in front of the world.
[32:08] We have to lower our gaze before people because of Chanda.
[32:13] Other times, for the need of money, we have to put our hands forward in front of everyone
[32:24] You return this money to Wajid Sahib tomorrow only.
[32:36] You know? If dad had been alive right now,
[32:42] he would’ve felt a lot of pride in seeing you so strong like this.
[32:48] And to tell you the truth,
[32:53] for the first time today, you have said something dad would’ve.
[32:58] It feels like it’s not you talking but dad.
[33:08] This same way, keep supporting me, Sitara.
[33:16] We’ll return him his money tomorrow only!
[33:24] We must keep whatever remaining respect we have, intact.
[33:31] Did you eat something?
[33:32] I don’t feel hungry.
[33:34] Listen, I’ll go get something for you.
[33:40] I don’t want to eat.
[33:42] I’ll send it.
[34:34] It’s been all night and this man hasn’t come home even now?
[34:39] How heartless is this person?
[34:43] He doesn’t care about me.
[34:46] Why is he doing this to me?
[35:07] Shameem!
[35:10] Shameem!
[35:11] Yes?
[35:13] Where is Shahab?
[35:14] I don’t know.
[35:16] I feel hungry, make me breakfast.
[35:19] I was going to iron Bibi Jee’s clothes…
[35:22] Clothes can be ironed later too! You make me breakfast.
[35:26] I have a lot of work! If you’re in such a rush, make it yourself…
[35:28] Oh, oh, oh…
[35:29] What are you saying?
[35:30] What has happened? Why are you making this noise?
[35:34] She’s arguing with me for no reason!
[35:35] She was asking me to make breakfast.
[35:37] All I said was that I have to iron your clothes. And then…
[35:42] What wrong did she say? Whose orders is she going to listen to if not mine?
[35:50] One minute. You’re insulting me in front of this maid?
[35:56] It’s only right. You should do your work on your own.
[36:01] How long are you going to stay in your room for? Now, enough!
[36:07] So that means there’s importance for this maid in this house and not me!
[36:13] This maid gets paid more than your father used to earn in a month!
[36:21] Don’t bring my father into this!
[36:23] Keep your volume down!
[36:26] And don’t ever speak to me in this tone again!
[36:32] And now, you will look after the kitchen!
[36:35] I won’t!
[36:40] You will have to.
[36:44] Are you giving me a threat or an order?
[36:46] Whatever you want it to be.
[36:48] Alright.
[36:50] So, why don’t you explain all of this to me in front of Shahab?
[36:55] Do one thing, you explain all of this to Shahab.
[37:00] And yes! Don’t forget to tell him that I am the one who has said all of this. Okay?
[37:21] Go. Iron the clothes.
