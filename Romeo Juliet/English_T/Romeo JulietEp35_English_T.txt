[00:16] First try to handle your father's responsibilities
[00:20] then tell me my duties, which I have fulfilled more than my capability 
[00:25] dad, for now you need to relax as your blood pressure is very high
[00:32] where is the dress, Master? 
[00:33] madam, what is this behavior? 
[00:35] the misbehavior is that you had promised for the delivery at 4 pm
[00:46]  I am really very very sorry. Are you fine?
[00:49] what sorry? We have endured such a huge loss
[01:08] yes, greetings! City Hospital?
[01:11]  I wanted to take an update of the patient who came to your hospital after an accident
[01:19] what! 
[01:23] he died?
[01:26] he died at this age?
[01:29] 60 years? No!
[01:31] sister, he wasn't of 60 years. He was a young guy, he was admitted due to an accident
[01:37] his name is Farhad, it must be in your list. Check it
[01:41] oh God! Thank God...
[01:44]  yes
[01:46] yes, divert the call to the room
[01:47] yes... my name is Freeha

[02:12] you too?
[02:13] what is this rubbish? Shall I slap you?
[02:15] what is it?
[02:16] everyone is calling you inside
[02:18] Okay, lets go. Come...
[02:26] Farhad. Farhad Yaqoob
[02:28] he is 202
202..
[02:30] mom...
[02:33] Jojo, please check what if they have amputated my leg
[02:36] what are you talking about?
[02:38] you just got a small wound on the leg, why are you doing drama?
[02:41] its hurting a lot, brother
[02:43] now gather that courage, fine & all...
[02:46] let that fine go to hell!
[03:00] what was the need to call mom?
[03:19] oh mom...
[03:24] mom, nothing had happened
[03:27] he is fine...
[03:31] be thankful that my leg is fine
[03:32] yes...
[03:36] I am fine
[03:40] mom, stop crying
[03:43] hey Kiran, make her stop crying
[03:44] he is fine, absolutely fine. He is lying in front of you
[03:47] see, his eyes are opened. He is talking
[03:59] Thank God that yesterday's function went very well
[04:02] the groom's family had called, they were praising yesterday's event a lot
[04:08] All of this is because of brother Yousaf
[04:11] he is getting Zara married in such a manner, as if he is her real daughter
[04:15] why? isn't she my daughter?
[04:18] oh brother, she is yours..
[04:20] Besides, there is no differentiation in the kids in this house
[04:23] Freeha & Saqib is ours as much as Zara & Billu is yours
[04:28] sister, also tell us what they had said about the jewelry?
[04:31] I had observed, Zara's mother-in-law was quite amazed
[04:36] be careful...
[04:38] what if they become habitual of all this
[04:47] such gifts exchange do happen in the wedding, & in our community they specially observe how much jewelry is given to the bride
[04:56] even we are counting in the shop
[05:04] that there shouldn't be any lacking or so
[05:08] dad, the party is calling again & again
[05:11] they want to buy our setup along with the shop
[05:14] we won't get such a nice offer again
[05:16] dear, I have already told you that I won't sell my family's business
[05:20] dad... do one good investment & then rest
[05:25] your generations will sit & eat at home without working
[05:27] I do all the hard work, & then all my generations shall sit & rest
[05:32] Not at all!
[05:33] until my hands & feet are fine, I cannot sit at home idle
[05:38] dad, at least meet them once & listen to them
[05:42] you listen to me! And understand what I am saying
[05:46] it won't happen until I am alive, but you can do whatever you want to do after my death. Ok?
[05:52] oh brother, may your enemies shall die
[05:55] and Saqib, what kind of a discussion you've started on such a joyous occasion?
[06:00] after all, everything belongs to your son after you
[06:03] so try listening to him as well sometimes
[06:09] sister, now you shall start doing preparations of Freeha's wedding
[06:13] its her turn after Zara's
[06:16] absolutely! I've been saying this since very long
[06:19] but our princess doesn't like anyone at all, so what to do!
[06:23] a lot of influential families will come in this wedding, I will also keep an eye
[06:26] And what as such tantrums she have? She'll like someone for sure
[06:31] She doesn't have any tantrums. We'll get Freeha married once we'll find a perfect match for her
[06:37] here you go, listen to him
[06:40] She does all this because of your undue favor
[06:46] did you see, how Saqib talks to us as if we are beggars
[06:54] don't you see how brother fixes him!
[06:57] yes, as if he will be fixed. Didn't you hear, what brother had said?
[07:01] you can do whatever you want to do, after my demise
[07:04] what does it mean?
[07:06] and what do you think? Will Saqib be grateful on us the way your brother is?
[07:11] if its in his control, he can separate us anytime
[07:16] you did a very big mistake by selling off your share of inheritance
[07:19] even you were adamant to get separated
[07:22] as you wanted an immigration of abroad
[07:24] nothing happened! We have ruined everything
[07:28] how would I know that the builder will be a fraudster?
[07:31] I had done my entire investment on that project
[07:34] it was my plan that my entire generation will sit back & eat
[07:37] a person do make a mistake and.. 
[07:41] you are his younger brother, its your right
[07:44] from which face I shall ask for more from him?
[07:47] from the same face.. 
[07:49] somehow you manage to take care of the expenses
[07:53] but think about the future, there is Billu's future... 
[07:56] somehow we have managed to get Zara married
[07:59] but until when you'll do this & how much?
[08:03] I don't doubt brother's intentions at all, he is a diamond!
[08:06] but his wife & son.. 
[08:10] if its in their control, they want to get rid of us as soon as possible
[08:14] don't you worry
[08:16] I won't let that happen ever
[08:32] Thank God Farhad didn't get serious injuries
[08:36] still he will make excuses, not to come to the kitchen
[08:40] its a matter of a few days
[08:43] even the doctor has advised him to rest
[08:45] after that he has to come to the kitchen.. 
Sometimes you become way too strict
[08:51] I fear that this guy is running way too fast
[08:55] and the people who forget their manners in such a fast pace
[08:58] they cut their roots, & their flight also gets affected by it
[09:02] Yaqoob, right now all the kids are same
[09:05] and there is no harm in changing with time
[09:08] hmm.... 
[09:10] there is no harm... 
[09:12] this kitchen is not a business
[09:15] its my existence!
[09:18] it has my elders fragrance
[09:24] wow! how my grand mother used to cook... 
[09:29] even today we make the same kind of rice
[09:32] and your son wants to change the same tradition, he wants to end it
[09:38] because this work is not as per his expectations
[09:42] by the way Yaqoob, I wanted to discuss about Kiran
[09:46] her in-laws aren't fixing the wedding date
[09:50] its been 2 years to her engagement
[09:52] what shall we do?
[09:54] every time they bring a new demand for dowry
[09:57] we are girl's family & we have to tolerate it
[10:00] they are saying that they'll come tomorrow
[10:03] I must say, stay firm!
[10:05] don't listen to any excuse
[10:07] yes... 
[10:08] you shall make me the bad guy in the entire world
[10:11] you shall be firm! So that people will say that he is the stubborn go, don't argue with him
[10:15] mind your own business, ok!
[10:20] be firm!
[10:27] Farhad
[10:31] Farhad, take this
[10:33] thank you!
how are you feeling now?
[10:36] better... 
[10:37] that's great!
[10:41] Ok mom was telling me that tomorrow Shahzain's family is coming to discuss something
[10:48] why?
[10:50] they haven't told us
[10:52] yes, why will they tell us? After coming tomorrow they'll put up a new demand
[10:58] I think, maybe their TV isn't working
[11:02] yes?
[11:07] why don't you refuse for this wedding, Kiran?
[11:10] Farhad, what do you mean by this? Why shall I refuse?
[11:14] its the matter of your life
[11:16] have you ever thought how those people will be in the future, who are like this today?
[11:19] Shahzain is not that kind of, ok?
[11:23] I guess, he isn't able to say anything because of his parents. That's it!
[11:28] Kiran, a guy who cannot take a stand for you today. Will he take the stand tomorrow?
[11:32] tell me
[11:33] Farhad, dad had fixed this proposal
[11:35] everything is in front of him. Now if it will end, then it will be done as per his consent. That's it!
[11:41] and all of us have to bow down our heads in front of his consent, right?
[11:45] Kiran... 
[11:47] be careful... 
[11:50] whatever is happening is not right. You also know this & I know it too
[11:54] just refuse for this marriage once, I am standing by your side
[11:58] Great! I mean, nowadays we have very less tensions in this house
[12:02] the tensions shall increase because of me, no problem!
[12:04] oh Kiran, stop it!
[12:06] there is no need to become a sacrificial animal
[12:08] will you relax now?
[12:11] let them come tomorrow and discuss the matter first, then we'll see
[12:20] now relax
[12:21] I am telling you, I won't stay quiet if they'll discuss anything wrong tomorrow
[12:25] Farhad... we'll see that tomorrow
[12:28] for now rest & drink milk
[12:39] its good that you guys have come
[12:42] we were also trying to talk to you guys
[12:46] yes, absolutely
[12:48] also, its been so long that we had tasted the snacks of your house
[12:54] hmm... 
[12:56] they are great!
[12:58] I think its been so long, we should fix the wedding date
[13:05] absolutely! And we haven't refused about it
[13:11] Besides, Kiran is like our daughter
[13:17] so when shall we keep the date? Shall we keep any date of the 3rd month?
[13:22] Brother Yaqoob look... 
[13:24] you can see the inflation, the prices are sky rocket high
[13:30] Shahzain had a bike, and we had to sell it off as well
[13:33] will he take Kiran out on the rickshaw or buses after marriage?
[13:40] the life is made after the union
[13:42] and a person's fate do change after marrying a woman
[13:45] you are absolutely correct
[13:47] but its important to be practical
[13:51] and we were thinking that... 
[13:54] what if you can arrange some small car
[14:00] so it would be good
[14:05] this way Shahzain's value will be increased
[14:08] he will be respected in his office too, most importantly he'll come in the sight of his manager
[14:12] and the important thing is that, Shahzain's promotion is our daughter Kiran's promotion
[14:18] we aren't asking it for ourselves, its for the children
[14:26] No
[14:28] what!
[14:33] I said, No!
[14:42] Enough is enough...
[14:47] you guys have been stalling the wedding date since so long, & today you've crossed all the limits
[14:51] car?
[14:52] Farhad
[14:54] do you think all this is right?
[14:58] how he is talking to us?
[15:00] hey! I should have talked to you in this tone way too earlier
[15:04] See, they haven't taught him how to respect his elders
[15:07] when elders are ready to tarnish their honor, then they shouldn't expect anything from others
[15:12] be quiet... 
[15:16] its the elders matter
[15:18] what as such wrong we have said?
[15:19] you are girl's family, at least care about our respect a bit
[15:23] we are girl's family?
[15:25] so?
[15:27] we are giving you our girl
[15:29] She is a living human being, not any think which should be weighed on the weighing scale
[15:33] you are making such a grave mistake, Mr. Yaqoob
[15:36] you guys will regret!
[15:37] yes yes, get out. Greedy man... 
[15:39] lets sit & talk peacefully
[15:41] nothing is left to be discussed now
[15:44] come on...
Farhad!
[15:56] what difference does it make?
[15:59] and somebody had to speak
[16:01] and what as such influential people they are, that we are dying for them?
[16:03] we need to... 
[16:05] the girl's family always have to tolerate
[16:10] then lets go, and get a zero meter car for the son-in-law
[16:14] what will happen then? Do you think their demands will be over?
[16:17] won't they put a new demand?
[16:19] and stop getting your mockery done, please!
[16:21] yes... 
[16:23] she isn't doing any drama
[16:26] you know how to create a spectacle
[16:29] what do you think of yourself?
[16:31] have you grown up so much?
[16:34] how dare you to talk in your father's presence?
[16:36] who talks here? Only decisions are announced
[16:40] do you have any manners to talk?
[16:43] is this how you talk to your sister's in-laws family?
[16:49] those people deserve it
[16:51] what do you think? Didn't I felt angry?
[16:54] what does it mean, shall I blurt whatever comes to my mind?
[16:57] we need to understand the delicacy of relations
[17:02] did you thought about your sister?
[17:04] I had thought about her, that's why I had said such things
[17:07] yes... now they'll come & say something. Do you care about it?
[17:12] yes, I don't care!
[17:13] I cannot let my sister's life ruin because of such useless people
[17:17] oho! sister's sympathetic brother
[17:20] only you are sympathetic towards her & we are her enemies
[17:25] make him understand something, teach him how to talk & put some sense in him
[17:29] was he standing with a strainer, when God was blessing people with wisdom?
[17:32] and don't ever try to interfere in elders matters, got it?
[17:40] Farhad, did you hear what your father had said?
[17:51] when he doesn't have an answer, he leaves right away
[18:07] you shall also take a few things, so that the work shall end quickly
[18:10] No, I cannot do all this. Besides, you'll scold me that you haven't done it properly
[18:14] Besides, I don't want to take any risk in Zara's wedding things
[18:18] did you see, how she makes excuses for not doing the work
[18:21] sister, I must say. Find a good proposal in Zara's wedding & lock her too
[18:26] all her tantrums will be over
[18:28] No mom, she is among those who will make sure that her tantrums are fulfilled
[18:33] All these things are before marriage, after marriage the reality is totally different
[18:38] as I said, I don't want to get married at all
[18:41] I will think once I will find the guy of my type
[18:44] so what is your type?
[18:47] See, the guy should be intelligent
[18:51] he must be supportive, give respect & he should be a good life partner
[18:55] hmm... and this way she'll get married
[18:57] hey girl, come back on the ground. 
[18:59] The guy should be good, well educated & from a good family background
[19:02] also he should be of our community
[19:07] wow! great... the world has advanced a lot & we are still stuck on the basis of community & caste
[19:14] No tell me, did anyone asked from the guy who went to the moon that from which community you are?
[19:22] no matter this world has reached to the moon
[19:24] we "Memon" will be the best people in the business over there as well
[19:28] and we'll fix the proposal in our community only
[19:32] we are sitting on the ground, yet we are doing differentiation on the moon
[19:34] nothing can be changed of this nation
[19:36] oh sister, why are you arguing with her? Best people from our community will attend Zara's wedding
[19:42] just see & fix some good proposal
[19:45] she'll also like someone
[19:47] I pray to God that it happens
[19:51] hello! greetings...
[19:55] Freeha?
[19:58] You are the first person who took my name correctly!
[20:02] how can I pronounce your name wrong?
[20:05] it had to happen
[20:07] she had married outside the community after so many fights, so its obvious
[20:20] three... two
[20:24] one...
[20:26] good going my brother, now stop it
[20:30] hello!
[20:32] stop it!
[20:35] oh Hello! Excuse me? Mister...
[20:41] the doctor has advised you to rest & here you are continuously doing work out
[20:47] I am so angry on Kiran right now
[20:49] what that poor girl can do?
[20:51] why?
[20:51] When I am asking her to let go of this proposal then?
 I am here, I will handle everything!
[20:56] so she must be liking Shahzain
[21:01] Jojo, how can one like such a spineless guy? I don't get it
[21:04] its love, man! It happens just like that
[21:07] Yes, but there is something called being practical
[21:10] the news is filled with such cases, torment due to dowry
[21:14] you tell me, the people who are like this today how they will be in the future?
[21:16] she must have developed understanding with Shahzain
[21:20] at least listen to her point of view
[21:22] I don't want to!
[21:24] She is doing such girly stupid acts
[21:27] by the way, you shouldn't have said such things in front of all
[21:33] ok relax, just chill
[21:36] calm down!
[21:38] lets do one thing
[21:39] go home, sit with everyone & talk peacefully
[21:50] No Jojo...
[21:53] I feel suffocated in that house
[21:55] whether I yell or shout, there is no one to listen to me
[21:59] everything comes back like an echo
[22:01] what to do!
[22:03] no matter how they are, they are still our family
[22:08] we have to tolerate
[22:17] four...
[22:20] five...
[22:24] six...
[22:27] hey Billo! What are you doing?
[22:29] can't you see?
[22:30] I can see that, but has anyone punished you for doing this?
[22:34] I am going to the gym from today, so doing the pre-workout warm up
[22:39] gym?
[22:40] wow! best of luck
[22:43] how come you got this courage?
[22:44] the clothes he had made for the wedding, all of them got tight
[22:49] and Mr. Yousaf won't give money to make new clothes
[22:53] hello! whatever I am doing is for my health
[22:56] whenever I start doing any good work, this black cat comes in my way
[22:59] this old hag is speaking a lot!
[23:01] hey leave it...
[23:03] he has ruined my entire work out. How will I become thin now?
[23:06] do it... don't leave it like this
[23:09] what is your problem? Why do you say such things to him? At least talk good if you don't look good
[23:13] poor guy!
Billu...
[23:15] come on eat this
[23:17] eat this...
[23:18] Shahzain, listen to me
[23:21] you listen to me, Kiran
[23:23] what was the need for Farhad to say all such things?
[23:26] I wouldn't have taken the car though
[23:28] and I had told you to listen whatever my parents will say, I will handle them
[23:32] you are right, when I am denying?
[23:34] but look, was anyone from our family expecting such demands?
[23:37] besides my parents are so worried about the wedding date
[23:41] so, am I not worried?
[23:44] Anyways, Farhad has added more worries to our problems by doing this
[23:49] and my parents are so angry
[23:50] when am I denying this? But at least think from our side as well
[23:55] Kiran, don't you trust me?
[23:58] when did I said that?
[24:00] the elders would have discussed it, I would have talked to my parents & the matter would have ended
[24:05] my parents do get such ideas, and later they forget it
[24:09] but Farhad has created such a big difficulty by doing all this
[24:14] now?
[24:16] I don't know, whether my parents will be able to forget all this or not
[24:29] take it
[24:34] have it...
[24:37] hey! you had gone to get lunch. What is this?
[24:40] this is our lunch, try it
[24:57] what is this?
[24:58] it tastes as boiled socks, take it back!
[25:01] have you ever tasted them? So, how come you know the taste?
[25:05] at least I can imagine
[25:07] after drinking this, my mind directly goes there
[25:11] you are so weird! you say anything
[25:19] he seems to be in a lot of pain
[25:21] hey! he is the same guy
[25:24] who?
[25:26] that girl's brother
[25:27] oh yes... he is the same
[25:30] come..
[25:41] hey bro! How are you doing?
[25:44] all good? how do you find the gym?
[25:47] its nice
[25:49] ok tell me, what is your goal? What kind of a body you want to make, tell me
[25:52] I will give you personal training
[25:56] No no, just now I saw YouTube.
 I will do it myself
[25:59] What is the need of YouTube? He is here, he will give you personal attention
[26:03] that too free of cost!
[26:05] free of cost?
[26:06] yes yes, after all you are our friend
[26:09] and now we have met you so many times, along with your sister...

[26:52] and what is your cousin's name?
[26:58] Freeha
[27:00] Freeha
[27:01] Freeha..
[27:03] by the way, if she ever wants to do the gym then bring her over here
[27:06] Besides, its a mix gym. Are you getting it? Nowadays its a trend
[27:10] yes yes, she can also come free of cost
[27:12] 2 people free!
[27:13] yes, why not? You can consider it as your own gym
[27:16] oh wow! then I will come daily
[27:18] its my sister's wedding within a few days, and I need to shed some weight
[27:22] but sister Freeha is quite busy, so she cannot come. Besides, she doesn't go to gym

[28:57] his cousin was praising him a lot
[28:59] he was saying that they have this city's famous catering business
[29:02] also he have done BBA from some famous university
[29:05] really?
[29:06] by the way, they seem to be business minded

[29:09] one makes you fat by feeding food & the other one takes you to the gym
[29:12] its quite a weird cycle
[29:14] eat these apples
[29:18] what was the need to give the card?
[29:21] don't know what they must be thinking!
[29:24] when did you let me tell them? And by the way, what's wrong in it?
[29:28] after all we are this city's famous Kitchen
[29:30] oh brother, don't use this word
[29:32] say it as "Catering business"
[29:34] nowadays people don't get such food items cooked
[29:37] there is nice arrangement with stylish food
[29:42] I will do all this
[29:44] then do it, but right now we needed an excuse for the meeting

[31:28] yes yes, we are best in business
[31:30] that's a big claim!
[31:32] you can check
[31:35] there is no need to give any big event, we are okay with any small event
[31:39] any henna party or so, we can arrange it
[31:42] my father has already arranged everything, but I want some small event like a dance party specially from my side

[32:39] I? why?
[32:42] oh Jojo, where do you get stuck!
[32:50] Farhad...

[32:52] Farhad
hmm?
[32:55] Farhad, I don't know but you have to talk to Shahzain
[33:00] to Shahzain?
yes
[33:02] what do I have to talk about with Shahzain?
[33:03] he is so upset, he is very angry
[33:06] really?
[33:08] maybe you haven't noticed, but I am also very upset
[33:12] Farhad... my dear brother
[33:16] I think you don't have an idea that because of you the doom's day has arrived downstairs
[33:21] it should obviously happen
[33:23] I am amazed on the fact that if doesn't make any difference to you!
[33:26] how can you tolerate this?
Listen to me
[33:28] Shahzain wasn't taking the car, his parents do say such things
[33:32] Shahzain is not that kind of a person
[33:34] Ok if Shahzain is not that kind of a person, then tell me one thing
[33:38] why he hasn't fixed the wedding date as of yet?
[33:43] very nice question!
[33:44] he had talked to his parents
[33:46] he had decided everything, he has explained them that this is the last discussion that they'll be doing
[33:50] he had also decided that how to stall this matter, but I am proud of you my brother...
[33:55] you've ruined everything!
[33:57] and you've agreed with him?
[33:59] our engagement is of 2 years!
[34:01] its not a joke
[34:03] engagement can be called off as well, Kiran
[34:05] get lost from here, ill-mannered guy!
[34:08] how can you decide?
[34:11] did you ask me?
[34:13] have you thought about it?
[34:15] you consider yourself quite different from others, right?
[34:19] but you are doing the same thing, that rest of the people do
[34:21] you are taking my life's decision without my consent
[34:26] you are a kid, Farhad
[34:29] just grow up, man!
[34:38] hmm...
[34:42] oh wow! such a delicious khowsuey (noodles)
[34:46] today was Freeha's day, so this is her choice of meal
[34:49] I knew it that she'll get it cooked as its her favorite
[34:53] my daughter is about to get married and..
[34:59] you could have got her favorite meal cooked
[35:02] everyone in this house comes after Freeha's turn
[35:06] what are you saying?
[35:08] everyone has same importance in this house
[35:11] yes! that I can see
[35:13] its Zara's marriage & the dress color choice is of Freeha's
[35:17] sister, don't you worry
[35:20] As it is, mine & Freeha's choice is same
[35:24] in clothes, as well as in food
[35:26] whenever I will miss her, I will go to her house to eat Khowsuey (noodles)
[35:30] what! we don't visit our daughters house like this after their marriage
[35:34] so, she is going to her husband's house after marriage not to some jail
[35:38] she'll get to know once she gets married
[35:41] that an in-laws place is not less than a jail
[35:44] hey Ramsha...
[35:46] what as such we've done with you that you are calling your in-laws house a jail?
[35:50] and scaring these unmarried girls
[35:53] don't you worry. Our Zara is so polite...
[35:58] her in-laws house will not become a jail for her
[36:01] I mean, our Zara is such a nice girl
[36:05] She will make everyone hers
[36:07] my Zara is a diamond...
[36:10] otherwise, nowadays the girls doesn't tolerate anything
[36:14] look at the divorce rate
[36:17] did you hear about brother Naqi?
[36:20] I heard, his daughter got divorced
[36:23] really?
[36:25] yes... true that
[36:28] it had to happen
[36:30] she had married outside the community after so many fights, so its obvious
[36:37] we tell everything to our daughters...
[36:39] now take Shaggo's example
[36:49] yes, now see what happened with her
[36:53] she got divorced, what's the use of it?
[37:01] the girls should understand this
[37:03] don't know why they don't understand
[37:11] mom!
[37:16] honestly, its quite shameful
[37:19] even today whenever they discuss this in our community, my head lowers down with shame
[37:22] what is the problem?
[37:25] is this an appropriate time to talk about such thing?
[37:28] its been 15 years to this matter, at least leave this topic now
[37:32] you've upset her for no reason
[37:33] whether its 15 or 50 years..
[37:36] her mistake will always stay fresh, along with its lesson
[37:42] one should not marry outside the community. Its a sin to think about it as well
[37:45] do you have a heart in your chest?
[38:03] aunt..
[38:12] aunt...
[38:14] yes
[38:15] are you fine?
[38:17] yes
[38:20] I am fine
[38:22] what will happen to me?
[38:24] mom & aunt shouldn't have said such things to you
[38:29] now I've become habitual of listening to these things
[38:32] Fine!
[38:34] if you had been habitual then you wouldn't be shedding tears like this
[38:41] what's the problem?
[38:43] what is the problem?
[38:45] as I said...
[38:46] I am fine
[38:48] I am perfectly fine
[38:50] everyone had explained me
[38:53] they had told me
[38:55] not to trust him
[38:58] but I was stubborn
[39:01] I fought with them in the name of love
[39:06] aunt, you didn't know that he'll betray you
[39:10] if I would have listened to my elders, then maybe I would have saved myself from betrayal
[39:17] they must have been humiliated a lot because of me
[39:22] he had completed the nuptial vows with me
[39:25] they took dowry from us
[39:28] and then, he ran away to the US
[39:32] he vanished!
[39:34] I had never received a letter in Shaggo's name
[39:37] but I had received the divorce deed
[39:47] now since I have made a mistake, so I have to bear its punishment
[39:55] love is not a crime, Fari...
[39:59] it can be lie...
[40:02] it can betray you
[40:04] and one needs to bear the punishment of that one mistake for lifetime
[40:13] this love & affection...
[40:17] all is different
[40:21] its very important to be practical to spend your life
[40:27] this is what I have learnt with time
[40:32] alright then, you shall also think being practical
[40:35] all of this was never in your control
[40:38] Aunt Shaggo look, until you don't forgive yourself the entire world will keep considering you as a sinner
[40:43] it doesn't happen this way
[40:45] it doesn't...
[40:46] Ok don't be upset. Get up, come inside
[40:50] where?
[40:52] I am saving you from committing another bigger sin
[40:55] what have I done?
[40:57] you have left Khowsuey (noodles) inside
[41:00] even I cannot forgive you for this sin, I am telling you prior
[41:05] you are such a big eater!
[41:07] you only think about food
[41:09] so? I am thinking about food only, I am not thinking anything bad for anyone
[41:13] yes?
lets go!
[41:16] come on, get up...
[41:18] you annoy me a lot
yes, I know!
[41:21] Come... they are so fresh, spicy...
[41:41] Kiran
[41:52] Kiran...
