[00:13] we have to start our family in the future, I cannot let my children grow here
[00:18]  the place where elders are so liberal, so how the children will be?
[00:22] and the clear thing is that Shaggo, I like you
[00:28] your friendship is so precious to me
[00:31] aunty miss you a lot
[00:36] but she didn't called me even once
[00:37] did you call her?
[00:39]  You know, she is in a lot of pressure
[00:41] I have been checking accounts since so long
[00:46]  there is almost a difference of 50 thousand rupees
[00:49] you shall ask brother Shahzain
[01:00] brother Yousuf
yes?
[01:02] I wanted to talk to you about something
[01:05] yes, come sit Sahggo
[01:09] what is this? Tell me
[01:16] you had discussed something with me, and I have thought about it
[01:22] then, what is your decision?
[01:33] I've decided to agree
[01:37] what!
[01:39] its such a good news
[01:42] I was thinking that you'll reject, and won't think about it
[01:47] brother Yousuf, if Hamid hadn't been there then I...
[01:52] I wouldn't have thought about it at all
[01:55] but Hamid is such a nice person
[01:59] but... brother Yousuf I don't want you to listen to people words & taunts because of me
[02:09] and don't know how sister Rashda will react
[02:12] leave what people say
[02:16] what is in our hands? It is God who make the pairs in heaven
[02:20] somebody gets their companion earlier & somebody gets it late
[02:24] leave this topic. Be thankful to God that everything is done
[02:30] maybe, this would have happened in Fareeha's matter too
[02:34] brother Yousuf, I agree that her way of doing it is completely wrong
[02:39] the path she took is also wrong, but..
[02:42] she is a child, she made a mistake. So please forgive her
[02:46] leave it, I don't want to discuss Fareeha
[02:50] there is no comparison between you & her
[02:54] you are different & she is different. Its a joyous occasion & I don't want to hear anything nuisance
[03:00] but brother Yousuf...
enough! As I said be quiet
[03:04] let me speak to Hamid
[03:18] Wow! you are looking so handsome
[03:23] see, what I've brought for you
[03:28] I am already feeling suffocated in it, and if I will wear this I will die
[03:32] don't say this, it will suit you a lot
[03:36] as it is, I like man in Formal
[03:40] and its your first day, so your impression should be good
[03:44] for the first time you are going on the job properly
[03:47] yes, but usually the CEO type people must be wearing tie over there
[03:52] nobody wears the tie on an entry level
[03:53] so won't you become a CEO in the future? 
You should go there with this mindset on the first day
[03:59] nobody can stop you in achieving success
[04:03] yes, but its just a start Fareeha
[04:07] it will take time to reach over there, right?
[04:12] a lot of life is there, we'll wait
[04:32] best of luck for today
[04:34] today, I will prepare breakfast for you
[04:36] ok?
[04:37] great!
[04:39] come quickly
[04:56] Farhad
[04:57] Farhad...
[04:59] Farhad, come quickly
[05:01] look, the egg got stuck
[05:06] what happened?
[05:07] Look, the bread is getting burnt & the egg got stuck. What to do?
[05:13] how did you prepare the chicken curry on that day?
[05:15] actually, there wasn't any time pressure on that day but today its getting ruined due to time
[05:20] yes, show me. Check the bread
[05:24] what shall I look at it? Its burnt
[05:28] flip it
[05:30] I am doing
[05:32] Fareeha, be careful
is one toast enough?
[05:34] take this tong
ok, give me
[05:51] I'm sorry
[05:55] I had thought to prepare some special breakfast for you today
[06:01] so, you've prepared it
[06:05] see, you don't have to take any tension until I am with you
[06:10] your PA is always there
[06:13] and honestly speaking, its much better than my omelet
[06:16] thank God that you've realized it yourself
[06:20] and you don't need to worry, I will give you the lessons
[06:23] maybe, one day you'll come on my level too
[06:28] really? So now the student has become the teacher?
[06:33] I haven't forgotten, shall we do a cooking competition on my off day?
[06:37] sure, you can try
[06:39] Done!
Done...
[06:42] drink tea
[06:46] you also take some
[06:49] its really tasty, have it
[06:52] taste it
No, you eat
[06:55] you may eat it
[06:57] okay
[07:00] as I had told you guys that we've got a proposal for Shaggo
[07:05] So, by the grace of God Shaggo has also said "yes"
[07:10] its such a good news
[07:12] is it a good thing?
[07:16] what will people say?
[07:17] what will they say?
[07:18] people will laugh on us, that what's wrong with Shaggo in this age
[07:25] these are old germs
[07:27] what's wrong with you guys?
[07:29] when she was at home, then you were worried that who is going to marry our Shaggo
[07:35] and now when she is getting this happiness while staying at home then..
[07:40] you guys have turned against her
[07:42] well... the proposal didn't come by just sitting at home. Everyone knows that they were meeting in the park on daily basis
[07:48] and don't know what was happening by making an excuse of an exercise
[07:52] its nothing like that
[07:55] we know Hamid's family since quite a long time
[07:58] and yes, they might have met at the park
[08:03] and people are habitual of making gossips
[08:06] as it is, did Shaggo took any step against our consent?
[08:12] and Hamid has brought a proposal at our house
[08:17] its very late for all these things
[08:19] I don't agree, ok?
[08:21] already we cannot trust life
[08:26]  I know how you people will treat Shaggo, if something happens to me in the future
[08:30] oh, please don't say this brother
[08:33] what's wrong with you guys?
[08:35] look at Shaggo
[08:38] She had listened to many taunts of the family members along with the outsiders
[08:43] still, she didn't uttered a single word of complaint
[08:47] She did the brought up of our kids, just like her own kids
[08:51] She had helped us in the house chores
[08:54] She had shared the happiness & grief of everyone
[08:59] but still, you guys have complaint against her. Nobody is happy with her?
[09:06] now when she is about to get married, still you have complaints & issues
[09:14] I am with you, brother Yousuf
[09:16] and... Shaggo is getting married. What can be more good than this?
[09:22] you people won't listen to us at all
[09:26] do whatever you feel like
[09:28] why do I care. huh!
[10:04] hey, listen
[10:09] when we'll present something in front of them?
[10:12] I've been working here since last 4 years
[10:14] they haven't presented me as of yet
[10:16] 4!
[10:17] you've been working here since 4 years!
[10:19] what are you saying?
[10:21] its a PR company
[10:23] only show-off is catered here
[10:27] as it is, the senior management will do the client dealing
[10:32] yes but we'll also become senior from the junior level one day
[10:38] I've completed my education from a government school
[10:41] I don't know how to speak proper English
[10:47] Besides, they'll keep me restricted to research work & data entry only
[10:53] but, what is this?
[10:55] no matter from where you study, but a degree is a degree right?
[10:59] by wearing a tie you cannot change the difference of private & government system
[11:06] whoever is sitting inside belongs to the private university
[11:10] and we are from the government school
[11:16] the same difference over here as well
[11:20] welcome to the real world, bro!
[11:38] you were favoring your brother a lot
[11:43] you know I cannot stand against my brother
[11:47] as it is, what's the problem if Shaggo will get married?
[11:51] one more person will be less from this house
[11:54] have you thought how weird it will look? 
You men are always busy in your business
[11:59] but our social boycott is done
[12:01] do you know, I've been removed from a lot of committee parties
[12:06] and if they get to know this then...
[12:09] I'm telling you, then you shall also sit at home with me
[12:13] Weird issues...
[12:16] you guys have weird problems in your life
[12:19] I am thinking about the future & you people are worried about your parties
[12:23] what as such is the matter?
[12:27] from where you came here?
[12:29] you guys have an issue with everyone's marriage
[12:32] earlier, it was sister Fareeha & now aunt Shaggo
[12:34] its elders matters, you won't understand
[12:37] I am understanding everything. Don't know in which world you guys are living
[12:40] let them get married, it doesn't make any difference to anyone
[12:46] it doesn't make any difference to anyone?
Do you know, a lot of our friends have stopped meeting us
[12:51] then they aren't your good friends
[12:53] I must say, you shouldn't meet such friends. You should kick out such toxic people from your life
[12:58] what?
[13:00] what! what do you mean by toxic?
[13:03] who enjoys in others pain
[13:07] oho... its aunt Shaggo's life. Let her do whatever she feels like
[13:12] if sister Fareeha had been here, she would have fixed everyone
[13:15] I'm telling you, its all Fareeha's game
[13:18] its good that she has gone, and we got rid of her. Else she would have spoiled my innocent son
[13:23] everyone is toxic here
[13:25] all of your poison will come out once you'll get tight slaps from me
[13:28] listen to me, I will only marry for the sake of love. Don't compel me to become rebellious
[13:36] what rubbish you are talking?
[13:39] did you see, what non-sense he was uttering about his marriage
[13:45] have some God fear, he is just 14 years old
[13:58] Enough..
[13:59] its good that you guys visit often, otherwise the house has become completely desolate
[14:05] why do you worry, we both are here
[14:09] Thanks to God...
[14:11] I just miss Farhad
[14:18] Kiran, shall we go to meet Farhad?
[14:24] but your father shouldn't get to know
[14:27] I am feeling anxious
[14:29] he had never been so far from me
[14:32] mom
[14:34] don't worry, give it some time & leave it on time
[14:38] By the way mom, did Farhad call you? Or do you talk to him on the phone?
[14:47] what is this mom? He had forgotten you guys for a rich girl
[14:51] and you are getting yourself unwell for him
[14:57] he must have talked to Kiran
[14:59] even earlier he used to stop talking to us, whenever he used to be upset
[15:03] did he call you?
[15:05] No, I didn't talk to him. Nor I got any call from him
[15:10] Greetings dad!
[15:12] Greetings!
[15:14] give me some...
[15:16] its good that I met you here, actually I wanted to discuss something
[15:20] yes dad, tell me
[15:22] actually you had deposited some money in the bank some days ago
[15:26] the accountant was telling me that they don't have the receipts. And there is some discrepancy in the calculations
[15:31] Kindly give me, you have them
[15:34] dad, what are you trying to say?
did I steal them?
[15:43] No, I didn't mean that..
[15:47] dad, I go to the office at 8 am in the morning & leave at 6 pm
[15:51] I have so many responsibilities of my house on me
[15:53] I thought to help you during this time
[15:56] but I think I made a mistake
[15:58] dear, its the matter of receipts and not a big deal. You can check them easily
[16:02] I work in a bank, dad
[16:04] I get so many deposit slips, I might have misplaced them
[16:08] if I would have known that so many questions will be asked then I would have kept them safely
[16:11] you got upset for no reason, I didn't mean that at all
[16:16] you are like my son, in fact you are more than that
[16:20] Kiran, I think we should go home
[16:22] at least have your food
dear...
[16:23] Its fine... 
Shahzain!
[16:26] at least, listen to me
[16:27] what have you done?
[16:29] Can't you hear me? We have to go
[16:34] ok dad, I am leaving bye!
[16:39] what as such I have said?
[16:42] he is your son-in-law, you should have talked to him carefully
[16:46] will I feel like eating the food after all this drama?
[16:50] he is a fraud!
[16:51] make him quiet
[16:53] I am telling you
[16:55] never trust him
[16:57] he is not the right guy at all
[17:00] keep an eye, he will betray you one day
[17:12] my daughter left hungry
[18:33] you were searching
[18:34] No no...
[18:36] you were searching, right?
[18:42] You & your father thinks that I am thief

[19:17] hey, who is this ill-mannered
[19:20] who can be there at this hour?
[19:22] I hope it isn't the death angel
[19:23] Mr. Agha, will he come after knocking?
[19:27] what do you say!
[19:29] let me check
[19:30] tell him that I am not ready as of yet
[19:33] I hope everything is fine
[19:37] oh, what's the matter? What do you want?
[19:41] what is your problem? Why are you after me?
[19:44] what? in what tone you are talking to me?
[19:47] until today, nobody has ever dared to talk to me in this tone
[19:50] that's why you are like this, I am not scared of you!
[19:53] at first you had switched off the power supply of my house, and now you've stopped the water
[19:56] why do you want to annoy me?
[19:59] PK didn't you tell her, that we get water on specific timings
[20:03] the water supply in your house might be 24 hours, but come back on the land from the sky
[20:07] learn how to live between illiterate people
[20:12] switch on the water of my house right away
[20:14] it seems that you don't want whatever is coming right now
[20:18] until now, I was respecting your age, uncle & the chapli kebabs prepared by you
[20:25] but I won't do it anymore
[20:27] hey! where are you going?
[20:38] it seems that there is no time for the water at your house, its never ending
[20:44] So, I am the president of this building's committee. Why I won't get the water supply?
[20:52] Wow uncle, your wife is great politician
[20:56] you are the president of this building, but you won't stay on this position for long time
[20:59] really? What will you do, tell me
[21:02] nobody has every dared to stand against me in so many years
[21:07] because I wasn't here
[21:09] save your seat if you can
[21:14] hey!
[21:19] hey girl! What did she said? And you are sitting quietly, you didn't said a word to her
[21:25] you also get lost, get out of here!

[21:50] Kiran, I forgot my watch inside. Bring it quickly as I am getting late
Ok
[22:18] where are you?
[22:26] what were you doing?
[22:27] Nothing...
[22:31] I was looking for your watch, I can't find it
[22:42] you were searching
[22:43] No no...
[22:46] you were searching, right?
[22:51] you & your father thinks that I am thief
[22:56] they consider me a thief?
[22:57] I will steal from that low class kitchen & hide the slips here!
[23:00] is this what you think?
No..
[23:09] until now I was being so lenient
[23:17] but now...
[23:19] I have to teach you a lesson
[23:25] Yousuf had said that start Shaggo's wedding preparations
[23:31] I don't understand this, why are you people doing the drama of disinheriting Fareeha?
[23:34] Call her back too, lets wed off aunt Shaggo happily
[23:41] even Khalid isn't listening to me at all
[23:44] then lets go to the market to get aunt Shaggo's bridal dress
[23:50] hey aunt Shaggo, you came on the very right time
[23:54] what's the problem?
[23:56] we'll have plenty of problems until people like you are in this house
[24:00] what are you saying, Ramsha?
[24:03] do you have some manners that your elders are sitting here?
[24:05] manners related words doesn't suits you
[24:12] now tell us, which color dress would you like to wear on your wedding?
[24:16] dad gave us the responsibility, now fulfill all of your desires
[24:23] by the way Shaggo, won't you feel awkward after becoming a bride. By getting all dolled up & ready?
[24:31] won't you feel weird?
[24:34] and I have never seen any such thing happening in our community
[24:40] sister, you know it very well that I have no fault in it
[24:44] all of this is happening because of brother Yousuf's pressure
[24:48] don't pretend
[24:49] everyone knows about your friendship with Hamid
[24:53] and then, you've already got us humiliated. Wasn't that enough?
[24:58] now this shopping & preparations..
[25:02] simple go to the mosque & get married, end this matter
[25:06] what's the need to create a spectacle?
[25:10] absolutely!
[25:11] now your brothers aren't listening to us. Get some sense & explain them
[25:38] aunty... 
[25:41] Greetings!
when did you come, Zara
[25:45] just a while ago
[25:47] aunt, are you crying? What's the problem?
[25:51] Nothing
[25:55] I know, they are after you because of this marriage
[26:02] So, they aren't saying anything wrong
[26:05] so aunt, what's right in it?
[26:08] everything is wrong
[26:10] Billu is right. Who told you that its a sin to get married in this age?
[26:17] its a community
[26:20] and obviously they'll somehow say something
[26:22] aunt, what else do our community knows rather than gossiping?
[26:25] they only gossip around
[26:26] if they look at me, they start discussion on my weight. They talk rubbish
[26:31] whether its a big or small matter, they just want to gossip around
[26:34] yes, now you can't spoil your life for the sake of these community people
[26:41] nobody's life gets spoiled by not getting married
[26:45] but when you weren't getting married, even at that time everyone was having an issue
[26:49] that they are being insulted in the community
[26:52] these people neither stay happy themselves nor they can see others happy
[26:56] aunt, I'm done now. Whether anyone is with you or not, but we are with you
[27:04] if Fareeha had been here, then she would have scolded everyone
[27:10] I always pray at every moment
[27:14] that time shall heal their wounds
[27:19] and our Fareeha shall come back to us
[27:25] you have always prayed for us
[27:28] you've always treated us like your own children
[27:31] if today you are thinking something about yourself then there is nothing wrong in it. I will talk to mom
[27:37] don't be upset, ok?
[27:58] I think it should be placed here
[28:01] are you back? how was your first day?
[28:05] it was okay
[28:07] just ok?
[28:09] yes, it was the first day so the usual training & boring work
[28:15] Fine, but initiate in everything so that you can stand out in front of your boss
[28:19] Ok tell me, will they look good together or single?
[28:25] put them together, in fact keep them single
[28:28] okay
[28:33] have you brought all this?
[28:36] you won't believe it Farhad, I had gone to buy vegetables
[28:40] but there I saw a shop of used second hand items. I got so many things that too on great rates
[28:47] PK does really good bargaining. I am thinking to call him a memon
[28:52] have a look
[28:53] is it good?
yes
[28:56] you've brought so many things, no?
[28:58] what's the price?
[29:00] Umm... 
[29:04] its almost of 7 to 8 thousand
[29:07] 7 to 8 thousand!
[29:10] Farhad, you have no idea that if you'll go to get such things from a proper shop then you'll get it of almost 25 to 30 thousand
[29:18] that's fine but right now its quite a lot for us to spend 7 to 8 thousand in one go
[29:25] you could have brought it one by one
[29:30] have you mind it?
[29:32] No Fareeha, I haven't mind it
[29:37] I took a loan from Jojo
[29:39] this house expense is running from it
[29:42] also my salary isn't that good, and just now I got the job
[29:45] we'll do these expenses once I will get a good job
[29:49] but I've bought all this from my money
[29:51] I had a few savings, and aunt had made me invest somewhere. So I get monthly returns
[29:57] that's fine, but look at the inflation
[30:01] we have to manage our expenses
[30:05] try to manage the things a bit for now, please
[30:12] why are you worrying, we'll manage it together. Its ok
[30:16] look at this
[30:18] Fareeha, have you ever paid the electricity bill of your house?
[30:23] have you ever lost the power of your house for not paying the bill?
[30:26] have you ever bought flour or rice from the budget store after standing in the line?
[30:31] have you ever experienced such an eid where you haven't got the new clothes?
[30:39] Fareeha, I don't want you to experience all this over here
[30:45] See, I don't want to put restrictions on your expenses. Even I am not liking it
[30:53] but I cannot afford it
[30:57] once I will get a good job, then I will get you all the best things in the world
[31:01] but please can we manage it until then?
[31:08] I hope you've understood my point. I hope you haven't mind it
[31:47] the secret of my beautiful skin is my wise wife
[31:57] Channo, I think you took that girl's words to your heart
[32:02] Mr. Agha, child, child... child
[32:05] she isn't that innocent the way you think of her
[32:09] she came to my house & threatened me
[32:12] I won't spare her!
[32:14] Absolutely! I am with you. You shouldn't spare her
[32:20] but shall I tell you something?
[32:23] that poor girl is all alone
[32:25] she came here after marrying this guy
[32:27] her family doesn't talk to her anymore, they are poor young couple
[32:32] who told you such a long story?
[32:34] PK did. Pk gives me the information & details of everything in this building
[32:44] Channo, I can recall our times after seeing both of them
[32:49] do you remember, when we came to Karachi after marrying then there was no elder person to bless or guide us
[32:56] we had faced so many problems in this city. If there had been some elderly person
[33:01] then a lot of our problems would be solved
[33:04] Mr. Agha, you try to look for your child in every person
[33:10] leave it
[33:11] maybe that's the reason Channo, that God has not blessed us with a child
[33:15] wherever he sees that one needs the love of parents, he send us there
[33:21] by the way Mr. Agha
[33:23] you are from Peshawar & I am from Gujranwala
[33:28] we had married by going against the consent of both the families
[33:31] then we came to Karachi
[33:33] there were problems in the beginning
[33:37] but now there is happiness, nothing is amiss
[33:42] except for one thing
[33:45] what to do, its God's will
[33:48] Channo, shall I tell you something personal today
[33:54] I don't have any regret that we don't have children, honestly
[33:59] because how can we regret on something on which we don't have any control or authority
[34:05] yes, love is something which is in your control
[34:10] we shall keep spreading it
[34:12] and I have never been miser in it, nor you should be
[34:17] See, this building & the people living here seems to be like my family
[34:22] I feel these kids are mine
[34:28] Channo... 
[34:31] do one thing
[34:33] this girl will be so grateful that she met such an amazing lady
[34:39] show your love to her
[34:47] I remember your young & mature time whenever I see her
[34:52] Mr. Agha!
[34:54] I mean, the way you fight with her.. 
[34:59] honestly speaking, you should agree that for the first time you've found someone like yourself
[35:06] Come on, fix your mood now
[35:08] you haven't prepared any meat but vegetables. But its ok, now fix your mood
[35:14] keep it less
[35:17] what are you doing, Mr. Agha?
Its just black pepper
[35:19] yes yes...
its good for health
[35:21] oh... 
[35:25] go Channo check
[35:28] they don't let us have the lunch as well
[35:32] yes?
[35:34] greetings!
Greetings, aunt Channo
[35:37] Greetings! All good? How come all of you are here?
[35:40] sister Channo, we have some important work with you
[35:43] tell me
[35:44] actually aunt Channo we get water for 2 hours in the morning & evening time
[35:49] and it gets over by the time our husbands are back home
[35:53] then keep it safely in the bucket
[35:55] sister Channo, we have small kids at home. Sometimes we keep the buckets filled & sometimes not
[36:00] obviously, its water so it can be used at any time
[36:04] and we've heard that you get unlimited water supply. Which means there is water but we aren't getting it
[36:10] really! Who told you this?
[36:13] we had realized it earlier but we couldn't gather the courage to speak to you
[36:19] and now?
[36:21] its so wrong. You are the president, if you can solve your problem then solve ours as well
[36:27] why not we shall give the chance to someone else this time?
[36:30] yes yes, absolutely correct. We'll discuss this matter in the next committee meeting. Ok?
[36:35] we are having lunch, shall I go?
[36:43] please have something
[36:45] No, I will just have tea
Thank you!
[36:48] Hamid, I want to sit & discuss about the future plans & things to get done
[36:54] yes absolutely, brother Yousuf
[36:56] honestly speaking, I can't believe that Shagoo has said "yes"
[37:06] even we can't believe
[37:08] Greetings!
Greetings, come Shaggo
[37:12] how are you?
Good
[37:16] just now we were discussing that wedding & its reception will be done
[37:21] so if you want to do a small scale function in the house, then do it
[37:26] brother Yousuf, I was thinking that what is the need to do all this?
[37:33] we'll go to the mosque with our family & do the wedding and.. 
[37:36] in the name of Valima reception, Hamid & I will go & feed the poor people
[37:43] it cannot happen, we have to invite some people. Some close relatives or so
[37:50] she is right
[37:52] as it is, its not the first wedding of both of them
[37:56] what's the need to fulfill the desires at this age?
[38:00] they should focus on their life after marriage
[38:04] and the expense we are doing on the wedding, we should give them as a gift. It will help them
[38:10] right Shaggo? You want this
[38:13] yes
[38:15] but I don't want this
[38:23] I mean, why are we getting married secretly?
[38:28] its ok that its our second marriage & we aren't youngsters
[38:34] but... 
[38:37] I am about to tie a beautiful knot
[38:40] and I would like to celebrate it with my friends & family
[38:47] brother Yousuf, I know this marriage isn't traditional
[38:51] but neither I am ashamed of this marriage or not of Shaggo
[38:57] I will come as a complete groom
[39:00] this is great!
[39:02] come drink your tea
you also drink some
