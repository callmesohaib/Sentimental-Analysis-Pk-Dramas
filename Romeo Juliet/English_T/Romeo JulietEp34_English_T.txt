[00:16] you shall make me the bad guy in the entire world
[00:19] you shall be firm!
[00:20]  So that people will say that he is the stubborn go, don't argue with him 
[00:24] mind your own business, ok!
[00:28] there is no need to become a sacrificial animal
[00:30] will you relax now?
[00:33]  let them come tomorrow and discuss the matter first, then we'll see
[00:37] hello! greetings... 
[00:41] Freeha?
[00:44] you are the first person who took my name correctly! 
[00:47] it had to happen 
[00:49] she had married outside the community after so many fights
 so its obvious
[01:05] yes yes, I do understand
[01:08] its such a hefty amount, what are you explaining me?
[01:11] the need is as such, I am helpless. What to tell you
[01:19] yes yes
[01:22] Okay brother, I can understand
[01:26] Bye!
[01:28] what did he say?
[01:30] what he has to say?
[01:32] he has refused
[01:36] none of my acquaintance is so rich to lend me such a hefty amount in one go
[01:42] whatever I have earned until today, I have done with my own hard-work
[01:46] I have never begged in front of anyone
[01:51] I am feeling so helpless right now
[01:53] Don't say this, whatever you've done until today you've always done for us
[01:58] even now you are doing for your daughter
[02:01] we are just asking for a loan, we'll return it at the right time
[02:06] maybe the situation gets better if Farhad starts his job
[02:16] he doesn't care at all!
[02:19] he would have realized if he had faced such situation or would have faced these difficulties
[02:23] he is busy in his own world
[02:26] will he do a favor on us by doing some job?
[02:42] hey listen!
yes
[02:44] just talk as I have told you, got it?
[02:46] why are you saying the same thing again & again?
 I've understood
[02:49] do it yourself. Talk to her!
[02:51] No, do it yourself... come on
[02:53] you are ruining everything
do it now
[02:55] hello!?
[02:59] hello! Can I speak to maam Freeha?
[03:02] speaking...
[03:05] actually sir Farhad had asked me to contact you, as we have to do a meeting with you for an event
[03:12] so our presentation is ready
[03:17] okay, who is this speaking?
[03:20] I am his manager
[03:23] I wanted to confirm whether our meeting is done for today at the same location that you had sent
[03:30] yes, its confirmed
[03:34] thank you so much! 
Maam, let me inform sir Farhad
[03:40] Okay
[03:43] manager...
[03:45] are you crazy? What was the need to do this drama?
[03:48] oh brother, there is something called putting your impression!
[03:51] so you should have called her at our kitchen, she would have seen our antics too
[03:57] kitchen! antics? are you out of your mind?
[04:01] brother, packaging is everything. Got it?
[04:07] look what he is saying..
[04:10] what shall I wear at the meeting, tell me
[04:14] what do you mean?
[04:17] why will you go?
[04:19] won't you make me eat anything after such a hard work. Miser!
[04:27] see you later
[04:32] he is so weird!
[04:39] hello!
[04:44] hi!
[04:48] Greetings! How are you?
You are looking so pretty
[04:52] is everyone fine at home?
[04:54] ok ok, tell me about uncle & aunty
[04:58] very nice...
[05:00] you smell so good, right?
[05:02] hi!
[05:05] hello!
[05:08] how is your leg now?
[05:11] its fine, completely fine
[05:14] Thank God! Do you know I was so worried
[05:19] were you worried?
[05:22] yes...
for me?
[05:24] yes, you had an accident. You had reached to the hospital, I was so guilty
[05:30] hey, its no problem. Accidents do happen, its ok
[05:37] you are quite understanding
[05:40] thank you!
[05:43] shall we start?
[05:45] oh yes...
[05:58] you were telling me that your function is a bit small. Is it for close friends & family?
[06:04] look at this
[06:06] we have decided a very classy setup for this
[06:10] white tent, cocktail table & fairy lights along with it
[06:18] And for food we have decided...
[06:23] for starters, we'll have dynamite prawns, fresh juices & spring rolls
[06:31] there is a lot more as well, but we'll add it later
[06:34] lets come on the main dinner
[06:36] we'll have live BBQ, along with live Tandoor (a place to make flat breads). Ok?
[06:43] and then comes the dessert bar
[06:50] actually I was thinking something simple
[06:56] oh!
[06:56] hmm...
[06:57] and...
[07:00] the setup is also very plain. I need something colorful
[07:06] colorful?
[07:07] and... the food is also very hi-fi.. .
[07:13] the food is hi-fi?
[07:16] I am thinking to get one cauldron of Beef Biryani (rice) & Korma (curry) as well
[07:21] you want a cauldron?
yes
[07:24] you may bring a nice cutlery set & dishes
[07:28] and the tents shall be colorful along with the colorful cushions with contrast
[07:32] you know, something pink & orange type
[07:36] I see...
[07:39] is there any problem?
[07:40] No no, there isn't any problem. We'll do whatever you say
[07:45] Great!
[07:46] you really didn't like anything in it?
These dynamite prawns?
[07:49] No no, its nice but you know just not my taste
[07:55] but your live Tandoor idea is good
[07:57] piping hot flat breads will be a great combination with Korma, keep Sheermal as well
[08:01] Okay
[08:03] I need malpura (sweet pancake) in dessert
[08:04] what?
[08:09] Malpura?
[08:15] don't you know about it?
[08:21] you are running such a big food business, & you don't know about Malpura?
[08:25] I think you should do your homework
[08:28] my family is very serious about Malpura, if anything gets wrong here then my reputation will be ruined
[08:33] no no, nothing will be wrong. I will get it arranged
[08:37] Malpura? It will be done
[08:41] Okay then send me the quotation
[08:44] quotation?
[08:45] yes! once you'll send the quotation then I will decide whether to hire you or not
[08:50] you may pay whatever comes in your budget
[08:55] think about it!
[08:58] I have already thought
[09:00] Okay, see you then
[09:06] Bye!
[09:19] Malpura?
[09:23] what is this?
[09:36] cauldron, she needs a cauldron?
[09:39] so sister-in-law is of our type, you were impressing her with your English for no reason
[09:44] we do catering..
[09:46] bring her to her kitchen straight away
[09:48] its fine that she needs this level of event, but I will do whatever I know
[09:53] then refuse her
[09:55] are you mad?
[09:57] I can do this event for her free of cost
[10:07] she was looking so happy
[10:10] her smile is so good!
[10:13] I can't stop looking at her
[10:20] have you taken drugs?
[10:23] what is going on here?
[10:25] dad actually..
[10:27] he has brought a new client, uncle
[10:30] really? how come all of this had happened?
[10:33] go place the order to Shamshad & mention the correct date
[10:38] the date is mentioned on his heart
[10:40] what did you say?
[10:41] I will mention it, dad
[10:44] go mention it & explain him
[10:49] what are you doing here? Leave!
[10:51] come on
[11:05] Greetings!*
[11:09] I have a news for you all
[11:11] what?
[11:12] I have arranged a dance function for Zara on Saturday
[11:15] one more dance function? Why so?
[11:19] why not? Nothing was done from my side
[11:22] the family is doing everything together, so what's the point of doing anything separately?
[11:26] all those functions are boring functions of elders
[11:30] this will be only children function, no elder will be allowed
[11:34] aunty...
[11:36] malpura! you are the best
[11:37] No no, if we cannot come then you cannot get this too
[11:41] let the children enjoy sometimes
[11:44] Fine, keep your malpura with you. I have done all the arrangements
[11:48] which arrangements?
[11:49] the planning for dance function is going on, that too from Freeha's side
[11:53] what's the need of it?
[11:54] just now I was checking the budget, already the expenses are a lot
[11:57] I had talked to dad, he said do it
[12:01] Fine! Whoever wants to come can come, and whoever don't want to come shall not come
[12:05] lets go Zara
[12:09] we'll order a malpura from outside
[12:11] uncle, I wanted to discuss something with you about the budget
[12:17] we'll sit & talk about it once brother comes
[12:21] it was Freeha's idea, we haven't said anything
[12:24] Besides, does it look appropriate to talk about the budget in between all?
[12:29] learn something from your father
[12:35] its all dad's fault
[12:37] he has spoiled everyone
[12:58] brother Farhad, check with the suzuki guy. Why is he taking so long?
[13:02] even the cauldron is still left
[13:09] ask him brother
what?
[13:11] let me check
[13:14] Shamshad...
yes
[13:16] what is malpura?
Malpura!
[13:19] its a memoni sweet dish
[13:21] and from where we'll get the best one? I mean for some function or so
[13:26] by the way, there is no as such demand of it. But you'll get it from Burns road (food street)
[13:33] Listen! we need it for Saturday's function
[13:36] find out from where we'll get the best of all
[13:39] oh boss, don't you worry. I am here
[13:42] hey Shamshad... have you delivered everything?
[13:47] one is left
[13:49] one is left? why!
[13:50] actually the suzuki was busy, I will send the cauldron as soon as it gets free
[13:55] its almost evening time, it was important to deliver there. Have you gone mad?
[13:59] do one thing, call the rickshaw let me deliver it
[14:01] how will you do it? Let me deliver it
[14:04] don't talk too much, you light weight wrestler
[14:10] go bring the rickshaw
Ok I am bringing it
[14:14] hey Farhad, what are you doing while sitting in the kitchen?
[14:20] we don't do such things here, you have to go with me for the delivery
[14:23] dad, why in the rickshaw? Let me call a taxi online
[14:28] what is this?
[14:30] dad, its an application to call a taxi
[14:33] so does the car drives with the help of a computer?
[14:35] oh no dad, we just use an application to order a taxi
[14:39] oh please leave it, I don't want to sit in your computer car. Don't know where will it take us
[14:44] oh dad, its completely safe. Its for your convenience
[14:47] I don't need any ease, rickshaw is fine for me. Got it?
[14:53] tell me something, why are you so scared of the technology?
[14:56] I am not scared of it!
[14:59] I don't need it
[15:02] come on, the rickshaw is here. Put the cauldron in it, I'm coming
[15:09] we could easily go in the cab, but No.. 
[15:12] he won't get any peace without bothering anyone
[15:20] very good, come on!
[15:22] be careful... hey be careful!
[15:31] your biryani is fine, nothing happened to it
[15:34] I hope you don't get hungry at all because you keep taunting continuously 
[15:41] Wow! look at your age... 
[15:43] we used to deliver ample cauldron in your age, and that too on different floors
[15:49] you are great!
[15:51] again you are taunting! I am telling you, you will start vomiting
[15:55] hey brother, where are you?
[15:56] Greetings!*
[15:58] Are you Aurangzeb?
yes yes
[15:59] the groom?
yes yes
[16:00] congratulations!
thank you, sir
[16:02] are you the kitchen's owner?
[16:04] yes, Yaqoob Karim Baksh & my son Farhad Yaqoob Karim Baksh from Karim Baksh & Sons
[16:09] I thought he must be some young man
Greetings!
[16:12] do you find him an old uncle? 
He is Farhad Yaqoob Karim Baksh, owner of the kitchen
[16:18] Okay, here is your money
[16:20] thank you!
thank you, sir
[16:22] brother Shahid, you have to serve this food
[16:24] oh brother no... brother Shahid, please sit
[16:27] there is no need to worry at all, I am here. Not to worry
[16:32] We have to mix it, we'll serve you after mixing it once
[16:36] but there is still time in serving the food
[16:38] how much time is there? We'll wait for a while, no problem
[16:41] am I only getting this personal attention or do you give it to everyone?
[16:44] No no, actually our Biryani is famous because there is a specific way of mixing it
[16:50] if you don't mix it in that way, then the person eating it won't get an appropriate taste
[16:55] Sir, that's why your kitchen is so famous
[16:57] thank you!
Ok sir, let me tell you within ten minutes
[17:00] do let us know ten minutes prior
Ok ok
[17:03] come on, line up this. Hurry up!
[17:07] hey, what are you looking at? At least pass me the cloth
[17:25] Boss..
[17:27] please get the food served
[17:37] oh brother, the main thing is how deal with the cauldron
[17:41] if you don't mix each & every rice of the cauldron with the mean then neither you get great taste nor the real taste of its spices
[17:54] Biryani's cooking has a separate value, but the real thing is its mixing
[18:00] which is only taught by a mother's prayers & a teacher's hand
[18:14] if you over cook them a bit then the rice can loose its charm
[18:35] you were absolutely correct! the food was really tasty
[18:37] everyone loved it! Sir, there is some magic in your hands
[18:40] there is no as such magic or so. Its just the love & affection of the person serving it & eating it
[18:46] oh wow sir! It was really good
[18:48] we shall leave now
thank you, sir
[18:50] lets go dear
thank you, brother
[18:52] thank you!
[18:53] Sir, you can pay whatever is easy for you
[18:56] its no problem even if you don't pay
[19:00] and I found Ms. Freeha quite wise
[19:04] there is no question of making her a fool
[19:08] how do you know Freeha?
[20:15] hello!
[20:17] did I wake you from your sleep?
[20:20] No no, I was awake. I get up early morning
[20:24] really? I hate to wake up early morning. Don't know what kind of people are those who wake up early morning
[20:32] honestly speaking..
[20:35] I was sleeping right now
[20:39] so why you have lied?
[20:41] I don't know what happens to me
[20:45] whenever I talk to you, I get anxious
[20:49] your anxiousness will start now! As Saturday's plan has been confirmed
[20:55] really?
[20:56] Yes! but everyone loves to eat delicious food in our family
[21:00] so if there is amiss in anything then we'll do your boycott
[21:05] No no, don't you worry. I will handle everything. Don't worry
[21:09] Okay then see you at my house
[21:12] house?
[21:14] So, won't you see the location prior where you need to do the arrangements?
[21:19] yes yes, I will visit your house as well for sure
[21:23] Okay see you then, let me send you the address
[21:26] Okay
[21:44] they are not wrong
[21:48] he has to apologize since he has done the mistake
[21:51] we have to talk to him
[21:54] otherwise, the matter can get worsen
[21:56] what needs to be discussed with me?
[22:01] they are saying that they are ready to forget everything
[22:06] if you apologize to them
[22:11] apology?
[22:12] yes apology..
[22:16] now since you've made a mistake, so you should apologize
[22:22] I haven't said anything wrong
[22:24] but you've talked in a wrong manner!
[22:27] you cannot apologize...
[22:30] but you do want your sister's engagement to be called off due to your ego, right?
[22:40] why are you standing like a film's hero? Answer me!
[22:46] See... did you see?
[22:51] what will happen now?
[22:53] what will happen more? Just see whatever had happened already
[22:58] what will happen now!
[23:18] by the way I should be upset with you
[23:21] but obviously! Even this time I came to talk to you like always
[23:27] So, why are you here to talk? Don't talk
[23:30] I am a kid, everyone thinks that I am crazy
[23:34] I say whatever comes into my mind
[23:36] what I had said is not important
[23:39] but how I have talked, everyone is stuck on it
[23:42] Farhad...
[23:44] why don't you get it that few matters are quite sensitive
[23:51] a lot of relations are associated with it
[23:55] everything will be scattered
[24:06] are you truly ready to please Shahzain &his family for lifetime?
[24:12] Look Shahzain is a good person at heart
[24:15] I have been engaged to him for past 2 years
[24:20] I am not doing it for mom & dad, I Like him. He is not perfect, but he is nice
[24:26] and Farhad, a person needs to fight for some relations
[24:30] do you think this fight is worth it?
[24:35] you'll fight for that mummy daddy guy?
[24:38] yes! I will
[24:42] See, I cannot explain you these things in words. They can only be felt
[24:48] you talk so filmy dialogues
[24:52] Alright then
[24:54] once you'll truly fall in love, then I will see
[24:58] presently you keep fighting with others, but you'll burn down the entire society then
[25:01] not at all! I only fight on right matters
[25:05] everyone has ruined my reputation for no reason
[25:08] and this love or so has a different place, but Kiran being practical is also very important
[25:13] really?
[25:15] Ok Mr. Practical, can you please say sorry to Shahzain's family?
[25:19] for me
[25:23] please
[25:28] farhad...
[25:37] honestly, I am just doing it for you
[25:39] I would have never apologized if there had been someone else
[25:43] thank you! 
You are great!
[25:50] oh wow! you should be doing a cricket team's coaching
[25:56] why are you wasting your life by marrying?
[26:09] Billu, what are you eating? Give me as well
[26:18] by the way, what will you keep in the dinner at the dance gathering?
[26:21] my dear, I will keep anything of your choice
[26:24] that is the most important, you know
[26:26] first I will get the menu finalized from you
[26:28] right now our priority is that where do we have to do the event
[26:32] we can do in the lawn as well, we'll serve the dinner at the drive way
[26:35] but the lights will look really good at the rooftop at night time, but there is a limited space
[26:39] So, lets do it in the lawn then. As per space we are good
[26:43] by the way, aren't you getting so excited about this function?
[26:47] a lot of functions are done already, my jaw is hurting while smiling continuously
[26:52] do one thing, leave this function
[26:55] as it is, very less time is left in the wedding ceremony
[26:57] No... this function is special
[27:00] why its special?
[27:02] why?
[27:04] because I am doing it
[27:06] and we enjoy a lot in such functions. Otherwise, after marriage the life is same.. boring
[27:11] No, I think the real life starts after marriage
[27:16] No, I enjoy the most in these functions
[27:18] we make so many new clothes, all the family gathers, we get to eat such a delicious food
[27:24] I enjoy the most in these functions
[27:26] I feel like attending only such functions, and the wedding ceremony can be done later
[27:30] hmm... just think that where are we doing the event as the catering guys will be here anytime
[27:34] alright then, lets visit the rooftop once. Then we'll decide & confirm
[27:37] again on the rooftop? I am not going, I've been doing the same thing since morning
[27:41] Fine, don't do the gym today. You've already done enough of exercise. Lets go!
[27:45] sister... 
both of you shall go, I am not going
[27:51] pick up the phone...
yes, greetings!
[27:55] talk to my son, come on
[27:57] talk to them
[27:58] apologize...
[28:03] Greetings!
[28:05] this is Farhad speaking
[28:09] I...
[28:13] I wanted to apologize
[28:20] I shouldn't have talked to you guys like this
[28:27] forgive me if possible
[28:29] say sorry in english
[28:32] ok talk to dad
hey!
[28:35] yes?
[28:37] are you done with apology? Now end this matter, as he is a kid
[28:42] shall we discuss something between the elders now?
[28:45] some important discussions are still left
[28:54] that last row is left, take it off as well
[28:57] See, all the flowers have dried up
[28:59] its a wedding house. So, each & every flower shall be fresh until the wedding is over
[29:03] change all of them
[29:11] one shouldn't cater so much of tantrums of these people
[29:14] No sister, whatever I am doing I am doing with the bottom of my heart
[29:18] all of you have such a good heart, that's why everyone else takes advantage of it
[29:23] sister, the actual matter is that you always talk about distribution
[29:26] try uniting all the family members, maybe the thinking will be changed
[29:29] I am not habitual of interfering in others matters
[29:33] whatever I have said, its for your betterment
[29:36] maybe you don't have any idea
[29:38] but I am observing how worried Saqib is because of the wedding expenses
[29:42] and these people's desires are never ending
[29:45] sister, nobody has expressed any desire
[29:48] whatever I & dad are doing, we are doing it from the bottom of our heart
[29:51] you also don't get so worried
[30:06] Farhad... stop!
[30:09] farhad
[30:13] thank you!
[30:15] thank you...
[30:17] thank you!
[30:20] thank you!

[31:50] listen! help me if you can otherwise leave
[31:54] oh my dear, the entire game is of confidence
[32:00] See, check this!
[32:05] sister-in-law likes bright colors, why are you wearing such sober colors?
