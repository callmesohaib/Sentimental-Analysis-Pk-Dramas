[00:13] We'll make this our home Farhad, together.
[00:20] I'm sorry...
[00:23] I've put a lot of burden on you, right?
[00:25] You should keep an eye on what's going on in your house.
[00:29] I'm saying this for your well being, otherwise you know I stay out of people's business.
[00:35] Do as mother says, give her the jewelry.
[00:40] Don't you hear me? Give her the jewelry!
[01:10] come in
[01:12] Shaggo
[01:13] yes, brother Yousuf!
[01:14] yes, can I come in?
yes please
[01:17] I want to talk to you
[01:20] yes, please sit
[01:22] I hope you are not busy
[01:24] brother Yousuf, I was checking the calculation of stocks
[01:27] oh okay
[01:29] Okay... how do you find Hamid?
[01:37] how do I find him, means?
[01:40] Hamid is a good person
[01:44] he is a friend
[01:48] actually he has discussed something with me
[01:53] what?
[01:54] he wants to marry you
[02:00] what?
[02:03] Hamid wants to marry me?
[02:08] did he said this to you?
[02:11] yes, he said this to me. Didn't he talk to you about it?
[02:16] No brother Yousuf, I swear he didn't discuss any such thing with me
[02:21] I don't have any such desire in my heart. Brother Yousuf, I have never ever thought about any such thing
[02:27] hey, if you haven't thought about it then think about it now
[02:31] now see...
[02:33] I have completely lost hope that you'll get remarried
[02:38] and we are fortunate enough to get a proposal from a person like Hamid
[02:45] No, I accept that its not common in our family to get married in this age
[02:52] but if hadn't been Hamid then I wouldn't have talked to you
[02:57] You are so lucky that you got his proposal
[03:01] brother Yousuf, the you've lost hope
[03:05] the same way, I don't have any hope or desire for the marriage
[03:11] I...
[03:15] I cannot marry
[03:17] please refuse him, I won't marry
[03:21] No no...
but at least listen to me, Shaggo!
[03:25] oh God, what shall I do?
[03:29] its such a good proposal, if it had been someone else then I would have never insisted
[03:37] I can't believe
[03:40] that Yousuf have already talked to Shaggo
[03:42] I had told him not to
[03:44] does he ever listen to anyone?
[03:46] even Fariha's matter got escalated because of him
[03:49] and now this new drama will be started
[03:51] it will look so bad
[03:53] that she'll become a bride in this age
[03:56] already the people are pointing fingers on us, Its difficult for me to face our community people
[04:00] how much more we'll be ridiculed?
[04:03] mom, I must say. You are way too good & naive
[04:07] otherwise, who tolerates such a sister-in-law in their house
[04:10] we took very good care of her
[04:16] and this is how she is repaying us
[04:18] she didn't care a bit about us
[04:21] by the way, I am not habitual of bad mouthing about anyone
[04:24] but now all the limits are crossed
[04:27] I am not capable to show my face to my family as well
[04:30] I can't tell you what gossips they do
[04:33] after all, the respect of this family is my respect
[04:36] we have to start our family in the future, I cannot let my children grow here
[04:40] the place where elders are so liberal, so how the children will be?
[04:49] Saqib, the time has come now
[04:52] we should get separated
[04:55] what are you saying, Ramsha?
[04:57] what else I shall say, mom?
Is anyone here who listens to us?
[05:00] you've said it now, but I shall not hear it next time
[05:05] what's wrong in it?
[05:08] when you don't give me importance in the house or business as an eldest son
[05:12] then its better to get separated
[05:14] being an elder son, we don't leave our family in crisis
[05:21] I am understanding all!
[05:24] who is explaining what to whom
[05:27] I have already lost one child, now I cannot loose another one
[05:35] mom!
[05:42] what was the need to discuss this matter right now?
[05:46] yes yes, only I am the bad one in this house. Rest all are angels
[07:11] Sir, I hope maam danger is not coming
[07:19] listen, sorry for yesterday
[07:23] its fine for me, but maam Danger didn't do good by picking up a fight with aunt Channo
[07:28] aunt Channo?
[07:30] yes, the same aunt whom you had met last night. Consider her as the head of this society, so be friends with her
[07:36] this mice related issues are way too small
[07:40] oh brother, try to take care of us
[07:42] yes, why not? 
take care of me & I will take care of you
[07:53] here you go, brother
[07:56] sir, shall I give you a free suggestion?
[07:59] is it free of cost or of 200 rupees?
[08:00] now if maam Danger or aunt Channo gets into a fight then do take care of yourself
[08:06] even brother Agha vanishes like a genie
[08:10] you also take care
[08:16] what is your name?
[08:16] PK
[08:18] PK means?
[08:19] PK means PK
[08:21] I mean, what is with P & what is with K. Or you've just kept your name PK
[08:26] Sir, when I was born. My mother wanted to keep my name with 'P' and my father wanted to keep with 'K'
[08:31] both couldn't decide, and then I was named as 'PK'
[08:37] okay PK, this maam danger... 
[08:41] take care of Maam Fareeha
[08:43] she says a lot in anger, but she is good at heart
[08:47] since she is in a bit tension, so take care a bit
[08:51] don't you worry sir, PK is here so I will handle everything

[12:19] as it is, as per your work experience its appropriate
[12:26] ok sir
[12:32] madam
[12:33] what is it?
[12:34] madam, I've brought mice killing tablets for your flat
[12:42] thank you!
[12:45] sorry danger maam, sorry maam for last night's behavior
[12:51] even I am sorry, actually I was a bit tensed that's why I have scolded you much yesterday
[12:55] and madam, if you ever need anything just order me
[13:01] thank you!
keep it with you, I will take it upon returning
[13:03] Ok madam, if you want to stay here peacefully then let her be. Its not good for your health to argue with her
[13:12] even I don't have time to argue with useless people
[13:15] keep it
[13:20] hey!
[13:27] what were you telling her?
[13:29] I didn't talk to her, I just said "Mind your own business"
[13:37] I am making chapli kebabs
[13:39] if I get to know that your loyalty is diverted towards her
[13:44] then I will only give you a beating
[13:47] got it?
[13:48] very good! Do remember
[13:58] it seems, our Channo got a new prey
[14:03] Mr. Agha, may God bless us with a sleep like you have
[14:07] honestly, there is peace in being unaware
[14:11] when a person spends so much of their life time's span in bombarding, then whether its a firing or bomb blast
[14:18] a person has to adjust accordingly
[14:20] you were so small, and now you've grown up. At least, you should start understanding your aunt Channo
[14:26] and when you do understand her, then do let me know as well
[14:45] hello!
[14:46] hello!
[14:54] Hamid, why did you said such things to brother Yousuf?
[14:59] I have family terms with brother Yousuf
[15:03] and I respect you & brother Yousuf a lot
[15:08] I thought... 
[15:10] I should discuss this thing with brother Yousuf first
[15:15] but still, why?
[15:19] do you know, you got me so ashamed in front of my brother
[15:26] Shaggo
[15:30] I am a straight forward guy
[15:33] I speak clear things
[15:39] and the clear thing is that Shaggo, I like you
[15:45] your friendship is so precious to me
[15:48] do you know what is the most favorite thing of my day?
[15:51] when I come to this park & walk, and talk to you
[15:56] I talked to brother Yousuf so that I can know your perception
[16:00] now you've the complete right to accept or refuse this proposal
[16:06] how can this marriage happen? Its not possible!
[16:11] why it cannot happen?
[16:15] will it look good Hamid that I will get ready & become a bride?
[16:20] you will come as a groom. What will my sister-in-laws say?
[16:25] what will people think
[16:26] who decides what do we do & what we don't do in our lives?
[16:32] shall I tell you something, Shaggo?
[16:35] getting married in 20 to 22 years of age, and then children in 23 to 24 years of age
[16:38] and we spend our entire life in children & family
[16:41] and when children starts their life when we turn 45 to 50 years of age. Then what about our life, it ends?
[16:48] when a person is lonely
[16:52] then the life looks so long
[16:56] when I go back to my house in the evening
[16:59] I feel way too lonely
[17:04] if you are happy in living your life alone, then its your choice
[17:08] but I think, if we have a good & understanding partner then life becomes way too beautiful
[17:17] and for me you are that partner
[17:22] whatever is your decision, you may tell that to brother Yousuf
[17:28] I will agree
[17:30] and I will always value your friendship, Shaggo
[17:36] as far as 'what will people say' is concerned, then I don't care about it
[17:41] I just care about you
[17:47] and I will wait for your answer. 
Ok?
[17:51] but Hamid... 
[18:05] he salary is quite low
[18:07] so its your first job, shall they keep you as a CEO?
[18:11] also you don't want to add your catering experience
[18:15] I shall go tell PR & Communication company my experience of catering!
[18:19] they will degrade me
[18:21] its a business
[18:22] I will give you a tight slap if you talk about the kitchen
[18:25] whatever it is is of Mr. Yaqoob Karim Baksh, there is no son or so in it
[18:39] aunty miss you a lot
[18:43] but she didn't called me even once
[18:45] did you call her? You know, she is in a lot of pressure
[18:49] Stop it! She had spent her entire life with my dad by staying in this pressure
[18:56] brother, if they don't care or worry about me then let it be
[18:59] I will manage everything myself
[19:11] okay I am leaving now as Fareeha is alone at home
[19:14] hey wait, at least meet brother Aslam
[19:16] he had helped many boys of our neighbors in getting good jobs
[19:20] whatever you are doing right now do that, but at least speak to him
[19:23] maybe he gets you something good
[19:25] he is coming in a while, talk to him then go
[19:32] I have been checking accounts since so long
[19:36] there is almost a difference of 50 thousand rupees
[19:39] you shall ask brother Shahzain
[20:24] even the power had to go at this hour
[21:40] six three..
[21:43] be quick
[21:47] now you are trapped
[21:54] you haven't done the good thing
[22:00] when will brother Aslam come?
[22:03] he must be on his way
[22:09] even Fareeha is not receiving the phone
[22:11] then message her & tell her that you are coming in an hour
[22:18] what happen, are you worried about Fareeha?
[22:20] oh brother, she can take care of herself
[22:23] sit here for a while, then you may leave
[22:27] means, now his wife will decide his timings for going out
[22:30] oh brother, I will never handover my freedom to anyone in my entire life
[22:35] brother was so excited, he couldn't wait for a second
[22:39] now he'll get to know
[22:42] its not like that. Fareeha is a very independent woman, she isn't like other girls
[22:48] as it is we give so much of space to each other in our relation
[22:51] means, you are trying to say that everyday you'll do an outing with us over here
[22:57] and Fareeha won't say anything to you, right?
[23:00] No, not everyday. But whenever I feel like I will do an outing with my friends
[23:05] and she can also do an outing with her friends, its not a big deal
[23:08] dear, let your honeymoon period get over. Then I will ask you
[23:13] Look at him, how he is being jealous
[23:16] his girl doesn't give importance to him, yet he comes to us
[23:20] this is his problem since beginning, he interferes in other relations
[23:25] he tries to show off himself as a love guru
[23:26] hey! at least I have a girl friend and I don't only do body building in the gym with the guys
[23:33] its a mix gym, we do have girls as well
[23:37] he has mentioned girls & boys gym on the board
[23:40] but in my entire life I have never seen any girl over there
[23:44] So, any girl will take an admission. What's the big deal?
[23:46] still she won't give you importance
[23:49] don't talk rubbish, continue the game
[23:51] I will ask you later, don't laugh
[23:55] work on it, don't be jealous. Come on, play the game
[23:59] let the time pass my dear, then you'll get to know
[24:15] hey girl, what are you doing here?
[24:18] actually there is no light in my flat
[24:20] there is no light in your flat?
[24:23] but the building...
[24:27] where is your husband?
[24:29] he has gone for the job interview, he didn't come back as of yet. So I am waiting for him
[24:34] So, call him
[24:36] my phone is upstairs. I will go with him to the flat, I am not going there alone
[24:42] come dear, let me drop you
[24:47] are you hungry?
[24:53] take this, eat chapli kebabs
[24:56] my wife has made them
[24:58] you can never find such a scrumptious chapli kebab in the entire Peshawar
[25:01] are you from Peshawar?
yes
[25:04] I am from Peshawar & my wife is from Gujranwala
[25:08] we came to Karachi 26 years ago after our marriage
[25:12] this factory on the corner, I was a manager there
[25:17] yes
[25:18] I thought that we'll go to Peshawar after my retirement & will stay there
[25:22] so why you didn't go back?
[25:24] Karachi is such a city
[25:26] it absorbs everyone inside it
[25:29] yes...
[25:30] its not possible to leave this city
[25:34] where are your kids? Don't you have any?
[25:36] we don't have children
[25:39] but all the kids in the building are our children. Have you met Pinky?
[25:43] She was such a small kid, in fact she was born in front of us. Now see, she is all grown up
[25:46] the entire building's children are our children
[25:53] Wow! you've eaten the entire kebab, but neither you've praised it nor you've said thanks
[26:00] consider it as an appreciation, do you know for the first time I have eaten such a delicious food after coming here
[26:06] its so delicious what to tell you!
[26:09] so what do you guys eat?
[26:14] plain lentils
[26:16] bad omelet
[26:19] toast & that too burnt
[26:21] actually neither I or Farhad knows cooking
[26:24] but today I have made Karahi, I will send it to you
[26:27] do taste it first before sending, what if its not appropriate to send someone
[26:32] I cannot say anything about it
[26:37] why don't you learn to cook food from your mother, or aunt. After all, you are married now
[26:45] actually, our entire family is upset they don't talk to us
[26:50] what to say!
[26:52] I see... that's why I have never seen anyone visiting your house
[27:00] you keep an eye on everyone!
[27:02] of-course, we have to. After all, my wife is the president of this society committee
[27:08] what!
[27:11] are you the husband of that strict aunty?
[27:14] strict aunty!
[27:16] talk with manners while talking about my wife
[27:18] I'm sorry... sorry!
[27:21] by the way, she is a bit strict & furious but very good at heart
[27:27] be friends with her
[27:29] then you'll see, how she is going to open the doors of her house & heart for you
[27:34] ok listen girl, listen to me very carefully
[27:38] there is circuit breaker at the bake side of the building... so
[27:44] if you ever talk rubbish about my wife then nobody will be as bad as me!
[27:49] don't know from where they came into our building
[27:53] weird people have come into our building
[27:55] See, even she took away PK's chapli kebab forcefully from me & ate it. Lets go!
[28:00] Come on
[28:01] Come on, leave her. They are weird people, come on
[28:07] Come, let me tell you
[28:09] forcefully?
[28:14] such a coward!
[28:19] by they way it was so good
[28:48] why are you sitting here?
[28:50] Farhad, I had been waiting for you since so long. Why you took so long to come back?
[28:54] I had gone to drink tea with Jojo. I had sent you a message, also I had called you
[28:58] I had been sitting here since hours, and you were enjoying outside with your friends?
[29:03] I wasn't enjoying, actually I had to meet brother Aslam for the job
[29:06] so why can't you do this work in the day light, Farhad?
[29:10] yes, but why are you sitting here?
[29:12] there is no light in our flat upstairs, and don't know how many mice are dead by now
[29:19] but the entire building's light is there, then why there is no flight in our flat
[29:23] how would I know, I am not an electrician. There is no light
[29:29] do one thing. Come, lets check the breaker. It must be at the backside
[29:34] you took so long
[29:35] sorry...
I've been sitting on the stairs since so long
[29:39] here they are
[29:42] switch on the phone's torch
[29:43] I don't have my phone
[29:45] where is your phone then?
[29:50] oh! it must be upstairs in the flat. But obviously, I have it
[30:01] Farhad, you weren't worried about me even a bit?
[30:04] I had sent you a message
[30:06] was there a blue tick?
[30:08] what?
[30:09] did you see a blue tick?
[30:12] I don't know. No.. I didn't see
[30:14] wow! you didn't even check whether I have seen your messages or not
[30:18] you didn't got a bit worried that my wife is alone at home, maybe she is in some problem or so
[30:23] what if someone has abducted her
[30:28] yes, it must have become a very big problem
[30:31] you are so delicate, what I would have done if the mice would have abducted you?
[30:35] Farhad, I was so afraid & you are joking
[30:39] Fine, its ok. Do you even know I did so much of work today
[30:43] I have cleaned the entire flat, also I have washed the dishes. Cooked the food & put a trap for mice
[30:50] what?
[30:52] you have cooked the dinner?
[30:54] what have you made?
[30:55] Chicken curry, but you don't realize that in what condition I am inside the house
[31:02] Sorry, I thought maybe you have seen my messages
[31:06] and at least keep your phone with you
[31:08] even this is my mistake?
 now find it
[31:11] it nobody's mistake, its my mistake. I will be careful next time. Ok?
[31:16] now find it
[31:18] look, there is one as well. Maybe, this is ours
[31:21] yes?
[31:24] yes, here it is
[31:26] check the light now
[31:28] is it on?
[31:29] yes, the light is back
[31:35] it was such a small work
[31:43] but it seems as if someone has switched it off deliberately
[31:48] or maybe it got tripped
[31:55] well... if it trips off anytime then do switch it on from here. Ok?
[32:00] shall we go?
[32:24] Wow! it smells so good
[32:27] then eat it
[32:38] let me taste it first
[32:51] hmm...
[32:57] tell me
[33:01] isn't it good?
[33:18] isn't it tasty?
[33:20] actually, its very... very
[33:25] tell me quickly
[33:26] its very...
[33:33] its very tasty, you did very well!
[33:36] really?
yes
[33:38] let me taste it
[33:45] honestly it tastes so good
[33:48] wow!
[33:50] wow wow!
[33:56] so tell me what have you decided about the job?
[33:58] will you accept the offer?
[34:00] actually the package is not that good
[34:04] but I don't have any other option
[34:05] Fine, its ok for starting. You can think about it later
[34:08] yes, even brother Aslam was saying the same thing. He said, get the experience first on your CV
[34:15] what will I do alone at home when you'll be busy in your office for an entire day?
[34:19] you will cook delicious meals for me
[34:21] there is no need to get habitual of it
one day will be your turn & one day will be mine
[34:28] means, first I shall do hard work in the office & then I shall come home & prepare meals. Isn't that an oppression?
[34:33] what about those women who does office work & then prepare flat breads for the entire family after coming back home
[34:39] what about them?
[34:40] yes, that's an oppression too
[34:43] I think, we should keep a cook
[34:47] absolutely correct! As if we have won a lottery
[34:50] I got you as a lottery
[34:56] then let me do the job as well
[34:59] I will get bored by sitting at home
[35:00] as you wish
[35:02] you can see
why aren't you eating dinner?
[35:05] I just had chapli kebabs a while ago
[35:08] you had chapli kebabs?
[35:12] from where did you get them?
