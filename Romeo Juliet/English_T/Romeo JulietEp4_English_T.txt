[01:30] If you want to express anger or want to beat her then do that at once and forget everything.
[01:41] Kiran come out.
Kiran
[01:49] Kiran let's go home. I am here to take you back.
[01:53] You told me that we should give one more chance to our relation so I am here.
[01:59] I felt that relatives support each other.
[02:03] But I didn't know that vendor will do this to dad.
[02:16] Dad.
Hmm
[02:17] How are you feeling now?
[02:19] I am feeling better now.
[02:22] Have you eaten anything?
No, I don't want to eat.
[02:25] No it's not good. Let me bring something for you.
[02:27] Hey, stop. Sit with me for a while.
[02:30] Dad, how will you take medicine without eating anything? Hmm
[02:37] So tell me, do I bring something? Hmm?
[02:42] I like the way you try to speak Gujarati.
I say that right.
[02:49] Yes and you are my best daughter, you know that.
[02:54] I can't tell you that how happy I am. You have completed my family.
[03:00] I am thankful to God.
[03:04] Promise me that you will never leave me again.
[03:09] I won't go anywhere.
Promise?
[03:12] Promise.
[03:13] But at the moment, I will bring something for you to eat.
OK, bring that.
[03:19] O God, thank you so much for completing my family.
[03:38] Thank you.
[03:46] Why are you looking at me?
[03:50] What a slap that was.
[03:53] How did that filmy hero come out from your inner self today?
[03:56] I have become a fan of yours.
Fan
[04:00] If a person is oppressed again and again then one day such emotions come out.
[04:11] I am amazed that I (Kiran) have done this.
[04:22] I used to tease you so much in our childhood.
[04:28] I used to ran away after beating you.
[04:32] But you never said anything to me.
[04:36] Hmm
[04:39] Whenever I said anything in response and beat you in response.
[04:46] Then I was scolded that..
Don't beat brother.
[05:00] Parents give relaxation to boys on everything and they teach girls to bear everything.
[05:11] That's why this happens.
[05:14] I am surprised that why didn't you lose your patience earlier?
[05:18] So be careful, you can be the next one.
[05:31] I have already got one.
[05:37] But you should slap more
[05:41] Farhad
[05:43] How long will you punish yourself?
[05:46] You should talk to Fareeha.
[05:50] Farhad
[05:52] Listen to me, you are not like those men
[05:55] who feel that they can control women by oppressing them and they don't have any regret on their wrong doings.
[06:03] You are not like those men and Fareeha knows that.
[06:09] I have witnessed that how much you have changed yourself and how much you have controlled your anger.
[06:21] If you say then let me talk to her.
[06:25] No.
[06:30] I have given her the right to make this decision.
[06:36] Kiran I can spend my whole life with her memories but
[06:40] I don't want to make her life more miserable.
[07:04] Fareeha is very quiet these days.
[07:12] It's obvious. She has gone through such a difficult phase of her life.
[07:18] So she will take some time to recover.
[07:23] But she is still confused about her future.
[07:30] I think that she should make her decision about her life.
[07:36] You should arrange to make her divorce papers as soon as you recover.
[07:42] But I haven't heard any such thing from her yet.
[07:47] Oh come on.
[07:50] Do you still want to hear from her despite all that.
[07:55] She has come back with her own consent by leaving him.
[08:01] But she still wants to live with that boy.
[08:11] It's obvious, it will take some time.
[08:16] But you can see
[08:19] That boy didn't come back after that discussion about divorce.
[08:23] Otherwise Fareeha wouldn't have stayed here. What do you say?
[08:31] What had to happened, has happened.
[08:36] Now she shouldn't go back.
[08:40] And now I won't let anyone interfere in our family matters.
[08:44] Our family has gathered after great difficulty
[08:49] No matter what, this won't happen again. So, please forget that boy.
[11:14] Listen. Listen.
What happened?
[11:23] My heart is pounding.
Do I bring water for you?
[11:29] Let's go to hospital.
No.
[11:31] There is no need for that.
[11:34] I am missing her.
Hmm
[11:37] I also miss dangerous sister.
[11:43] Arrogant aunt cum dangerous sister.
[11:45] Arrogant? Who has called my wife arrogant. Let me kill that person.
[11:51] Just leave it.
[11:54] Call her.
[11:56] Hmm
[11:58] You should rather go and meet her.
[12:04] You will feel better.
[12:07] Right?
[12:08] Let me bring water for you.
No.
[12:12] Wait, let me make tea for you.
[12:27] How dare they, first her brother misbehaved with him and now she has done that.
[12:33] I was telling you from the very first day that they are not good people.
[12:37] Didn't you see her brother's attitude that day.
[12:39] That's why I wanted you to take proposal for other girl.
[12:43] She was an orphan and she was very rich.
[12:48] And such helpless girls can be oppressed very easily.
[12:51] So what can we do now? He chose her so he should bear that.
You should keep quiet.
[12:58] What does she think that she will defeat me by creating this drama? Hmm?
[13:03] And she will set herself free from me.
[13:06] No mom.
[13:08] She doesn't know me.
[13:10] I won't spare here that easily.
[13:13] Just leave her.
[13:14] I have so many girls for you.
I only want Kiran. Only Kiran.
[13:42] Mom, I am going to restaurant.
But eat breakfast.
[13:58] I want to discuss something.
Yes what's up.
[14:07] Tell me about your wife, how is she?
[14:12] Kiran has told me that there is some conflict between both of you.
[14:26] I was very angry that day.
[14:31] I was in deep shock.
[14:39] I should have given her a chance.
[14:42] Now, it's useless to discuss this mom.
[14:44] Why?
[14:49] It's not that easy.
[14:53] I will go there to appease her because she is angry because of me.
It's too late mom.
[15:01] And by the way, whatever has happened between me and Fareeha
[15:09] That happened only because of my mistake.
[15:13] It's not your fault.
[15:20] I am going.
[15:30] How do I convince him?
[15:35] What should I do?
[15:46] When will your wife bring eatables?
[15:49] You will have to wait for that.
Well.
[15:51] She is making snacks and you are eating this chocolate without sharing.
[15:57] Now it's mine and I won't give you.
[15:59] Take it Fareeha, I won't give him this chocolate.
[16:04] Fareeha
[16:07] What are you thinking?
[16:09] Give me chocolate.
What are you doing?
[16:18] Fareeha, he has won because you didn't support me.
[16:22] And she won't support you because she favors me. Am I right sister?
[16:33] The favorite snacks of Zara and Fareeha are ready.
[16:37] Wow aunt, that's great.
[16:40] Do you know that I tried my best to make these snacks in my in-laws' house but
[16:44] I couldn't match the taste of your snacks.
[16:47] You can't even match that because she has some magic in her hands
[16:52] Hamid, I used to live in this house.
[16:57] If you have some plans to go for outing with your friends then you can go. I didn't stop you.
[17:02] Ever since, I have married you. I have disconnected myself from all my friends.
[17:07] This is too much uncle.
Yes, you are right.
[17:12] Our aunt is a wonderful lady.
Our Samad is very lucky as well.
[17:18] Let's proceed.
Let me give you.
[17:20] Brother, please take it.
You should take it first.
[17:22] I eat these frequently.
Give Fareeha.
[18:10] What are you thinking my child?
[18:12] When did you come?
[18:15] You don't know that who is coming here these days.
[18:20] There is nothing like that.
[18:24] Fareeha has come back but my daughter has lost somewhere.
[18:34] What's the matter?
[18:37] Tell me, aren't you happy in this house?
[18:45] I don't know dad.
[18:48] I think I have lost myself somewhere while shifting from one house to another.
[19:01] You have seen the outcome of listening to your heart
[19:05] now you should listen to your mind.
[19:31] You are in your own world of hope and you don't want that if you take a step
[19:37] and nothing happens as per your desire then
[19:44] You will be disappointed.
[19:46] When new mall will be constructed then they will give us a new and better shop
[19:50] And there is a plan to open store on partnership.
[19:55] Then Motiwala Jewelers will become famous in the city.
[20:08] Can I order two plates biryani?
[20:10] Yes sir, Shamshad, bring two plates biryani.
[20:13] Sir go to your table.
[20:16] Uncle Agha.
[20:20] How are you?
[20:24] You have forgotten us and never talked to us so I thought to meet you.
[20:29] Sorry uncle.
[20:30] Please sit. Shamshad, bring special biryani.
[20:37] How are you?
[20:41] I miss both of you so much.
[20:43] Everything is dull without fights between Fareeha and your aunt.
[20:47] Your aunt has become absolutely quiet
[20:50] and as you know that I get depressed if there is no tension around me.
[20:54] Uncle, I thought to visit your house but I couldn't do that.
[21:01] Why?
Maybe I don't want to face her.
[21:09] Rather all my belongings are there.
[21:13] I can send your belongings if you want.
[21:17] No, uncle. Don't do that.
[21:21] Those belongings are useless if my most valuable thing is not with me.
[21:31] Farhad your story is not over yet.
[21:35] Failed love sometimes becomes fairy tales.
[21:43] But your story is incomplete now.
[21:48] Maybe
[21:52] Listen
[21:55] Everything comes to an end whether it is a relationship, good or bad days or stories
[22:04] No matter what we do, in the end we have to face end.
[22:15] I think you are afraid of seeing the end.
[22:22] You are living in your own world of hope and you are afraid that if nothing happens as per your desire then
[22:36] You are afraid of that.
[22:40] Look at me Farhad
[22:45] You should listen, understand and believe what is in your heart.
[22:55] You should have a firm trust and belief on your internal feelings.
[23:00] Then you will see that all paths will be clear for you.
[23:07] Wow, nice aroma. I am missing brother Yaqoob at the moment.
[23:25] Did you like it?
[23:30] Brother Yaqoob never asked this question.
[23:34] Because he used to be sure that his biryani is very delicious.
[23:38] Let's taste and see.
[23:41] Didn't you like it?
[23:43] No, It's good
[23:48] Uncle, it's the same recipe which was used by dad. We haven't changed anything.
[23:57] Just like Fareeha is your lover in the same way this biryani was the lover of brother Yaqoob.
[24:06] You just need to add love into it, taste will come in automatically.
[24:16] Do I bring cold drink for you?
[24:18] Yes.
Shamshad, bring cold drink.
[24:31] It's delicious. I enjoyed it.
[24:35] Madam
[24:37] Miss Channo has come to meet you.
Bring her in.
[25:00] Come here, sit.
[25:05] Bring water.
[25:09] How are you?
[25:12] I am fine. How about you?
[25:14] I am fine.
[25:16] I am really sorry.
[25:18] It's been so long that I didn't come to meet you. I couldn't get a chance.
[25:22] No. No.
[25:23] No problem.
[25:24] You have come back after a long time and it was not easy for you to come back. Are you alright?
[25:37] Does Farhad come to meet you?
We didn't meet after that day.
[25:45] Have you thought anything?
[25:49] I don't know aunt, I am a bit confused because of conflict of my heart and mind.
[25:57] Only that will win who will be more powerful. Right?
[26:04] Maybe dad is right.
[26:08] I have listened to my heart once so this time I should listen to my mind.
[26:16] Why didn't you recognize yourself?
[26:22] You have got a generous heart and you give priority to your heart.
[26:28] Look
[26:31] You hated me from bottom of your heart but then you convinced me.
[26:37] It's a connection between our hearts. Right?
[26:45] I have brought vegetable curry and corn bread for you.
[26:49] Thank you.
[26:55] To be honest
[27:03] I missed you so much
[27:07] Everything became dull and quiet without you.
[27:16] I consider you as my daughter so I don't feel happy without you.
[27:31] You have fulfilled duty of being a mother.
[27:36] And now I promise that there won't any distance between us.
[27:42] I will come soon to meet you. Right?
[27:50] Are you happy here?
[27:54] Will you come to meet me?
Yes.
[27:58] Promise?
Yes, promise, I will come soon to meet you.
[28:28] Greetings dad.
Greetings, what's up.
[28:34] Dad
[28:37] I want to discuss something.
Yes go ahead.
[28:42] Dad, I have finalized the deal of our shop.
Oh I see.
[28:51] Congratulations.
[28:54] But
[28:57] I have seen so many people like Murtaza in my business life.
[29:05] You have grown up and you make your decisions by yourself but
[29:09] You shouldn't be afraid of such people.
[29:16] Dad, I am not selling shop to bottle vendor.
[29:21] Really? Then whom did you sell?
[29:25] Mr. Siddiqui is an old jeweler.
[29:30] But I don't know him.
[29:32] Dad, he is not a Memon.
[29:37] Our relatives have deceived us so much that's why I have made this deal with an outsider.
[29:43] And I have done partnership with him.
[29:49] He will give us new and better shop in new mall.
[29:53] And we also have plans to open more branches together.
[29:58] Motiwala jewelers will be spread in the whole city.
[30:03] Dad
[30:06] Have I made a right decision Dad?
[30:11] That's wonderful. You have done a great job.
[30:16] Thank you dad.
[30:19] You have made a very good decision. My son has grown up.
[30:26] Thank you dad.
Love you my son. Great job.
[30:30] Thank you dad.
[30:33] That's great.
[31:21] Damn
[31:36] What are you doing? 
[31:39] Why are you packing your things?
[31:43] I am talking to you. What are you doing?
[31:45] What is left to be discussed now? Hmm?
[31:51] Let's discuss. Come sit.
[31:53] I don't want to discuss. You have lied to me.
[31:57] You fooled me by lying to me.
You are not understanding my point.
[32:03] Let's discuss in a peaceful way.
Why should I understand.
[32:05] You put my baby's future at stake and want me to understand.
[32:09] Isn't that baby mine?
[32:10] That is mine as much as yours.
But it doesn't seem like that.
[32:13] Otherwise you wouldn't have made this decision by putting his future at stake.
[32:17] Have you lost your mind? What are you talking about?
[32:21] I am also concerned for him as much as you are concerned for him 
[32:23] but that doesn't mean that I will stand against my father.
[32:26] Do you want me to misbehave with my father?
It's useless to talk to you.
[32:30] OK, put these things back. You won't go anywhere.
[32:36] When you will set yourself free from your mother's influence then you will get the right to give me orders.
[32:42] This is strange.
[32:44]  And you should understand one thing that I will manage to give all my baby's right to him.
[32:49] You can be fooled by your parents but not me.
I will...
[32:55] Talk about my parents in a respectful manner.
[33:23] How do you know that Billo has done that.
[33:29] What's this?
[33:32] But how can you say that it's Billo's chain?
[33:37] I have gifted her.
[33:42] I took her for dinner and gave her this as a gift.
[33:46] Wow, wow.
[33:48] Don't look at me like this, you asked me to hire her.
[33:51] But I asked you to hire in your gym, I didn't ask you to become a slave of her.
[33:58] Oh God.
[34:04] How long you are doing this?
[34:07] I only took her once.
Huh
[34:11] I am unable to understand one thing that all doors and windows are in tact
[34:17]  then how did she took everything?
[34:19] Actually, I gave her duplicate key.
Are you mad?
[34:26] Oh man, you are such a fool.
[34:40] Have you informed Farhad?
[34:42] I didn't tell him because he is already upset.
[34:45] I thought that I will introduce her to him once situation will be in my favor.
[34:51] So what should we do now? Should we file a report?
[34:55] In police?
Yes.
[34:57] But what will police do when I gave her the key myself.
[35:00] There is no need to tell them that you did that.
[35:06] I think we should avoid this matter and close this right here.
[35:11] There will be a huge problem if Farhad knows about it.
[35:14] Jojo, I didn't know that you are such a big fool.
[35:20] Stop it dude, how much you will scold me? I didn't know that she will do that.
[35:28] Let's think about future.
[35:30] It's obvious that we should think about future because you haven't left anything behind.
[35:38] You are behaving like a dog.
[35:42] From where did you buy this?
From Gulf.
[35:45] And how much it costs?
Five thousand.
[35:49] Oh really? But you never bought five rupee ice cream for me.
[35:53] But you are not that beautiful.
[35:55] So now you have seen the outcome of that.
[35:58] Stop this nonsense.
By the way she was so clever. 
[36:02] Even I couldn't understand her.
[36:05] So how could a fool like you understand her.
[36:12] We will have to inform Farhad.
[36:22] What are you doing here?
Sir, I was adding onion.
[36:26] There is rush outside and you have to wash these plates as well.
[36:29] Yes, I will do that.
[36:30] Do it quickly.
Yes, I will do that.
[38:28] Why have you called me?
[38:30] What do you think that you can hide this deal from us?
[38:35] I was not in a mood to hide.
What did you do to that person?
[38:39] Have you lost your mind?
It's business.
[38:43] There is no difference between any cast. You were teaching the same thing to me.
[38:47] You are playing very smartly. You will regret.
Don't give me threat.
[38:54] Be thankful that I didn't go to police to file a report against you.
[38:57] Police can't do anything against me. It's in my pocket.
[39:02] You have only witnessed our politeness. 
[39:05] You won't bear our cunning face. Don't call me again.
[39:16] I will have to treat him in other way. He won't understand like this.
[39:22] Let me do something.
[39:23] We have grind all spices here by ourselves.
[39:26] We don't compromise on anything. I take care of everything from oil, ghee and pulses.
[39:32] But we don't compromise on quality.
You serve such a substandard food to people.
[39:37] What's the matter?
[39:38] You serve rotten food here. My son came here with his friend for lunch.
[39:43] After that they are not feeling well and they are in hospital. They are continuously vomiting.
[39:47] Sir, we make fresh food daily. 
[39:50] We have been dealing since a long time and we have never faced any such complaint.
[39:52] So you want to say that I am lying.
[39:55] No sir, I am not saying that you are lying, but I want to say that maybe there is some other reason or maybe they eat something else.
[40:01] No, he ate here.
[40:02] Then he went to home.
[40:03] Her condition became worse after one hour. There were so many other people who ate here.
[40:09] Is this a coincidence?
[40:11] Sir, I am just saying that...
Brother Farhad
[40:13] Customers are vomiting outside.
Look, I was right.
[40:16] They are suffering because they ate from here.
[40:18] Everyone got sick after eating rotten food from here.
[40:22] I won't spare you.
[40:25] This is not the right way to talk. If it's our mistake then we will apologize.
[40:28] Go to hell with your apology.
[40:30] Who will bear the hospital expenses
[40:32] Sir, it's our mistake so we will bear that.
[40:33] If anything happened to my son then I am telling you, I won't spare you.
[40:40] Remember it.
