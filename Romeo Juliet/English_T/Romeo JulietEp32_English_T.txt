[00:16] I hope you don't have any other plans in your mind with that guy
[00:21] No... not at all! Are you mad?
[00:25]  no no..
[00:31] by the way, he is very cute 
[00:34] really? Are you telling the truth?
[00:37]  do we joke with each other? 
[00:38] No, we don't
[00:40] I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
[00:45] if you also have a daughter 
[00:48] then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
[00:51] I think... 
[00:53] there is nobody in this world except for you
[01:11] Farhad 
[01:13] what's the matter? Jojo was telling me that its an urgent matter
[01:16] is everything fine? 
[01:18] I hope there isn't any issue of Malpura (dessert) otherwise, my family will kill me!
[01:22] SShh.... 
[01:24] be quiet
[01:49] I've gathered the courage with a lot of difficulty
[01:53]  maybe, I won't be able to say it again
[02:03] Freeha
[02:09] I...
[02:17] I have fallen in love with you
[02:29] I don't know what happens to me after seeing you
[02:34] It feels... 
[02:36] there is nobody in this world except for you
[02:43] maybe I've become crazy but... 
[02:46] seriously..
[02:51] I love you!
[03:11] brother Saqib!
[03:16] you got scared, right?
[03:18] its not so easy to fall in love with me, it needs a lot of courage
[03:27] you can try me
[03:30] time will tell, whether you pass or fail in this love test
[03:40] I haven't failed till date
[03:43] because you have never faced such a beautiful exam in your life ever
[03:47] even a great player starts sweating 
[03:51] are you challenging me?
[03:55] challenge is such a small word
[03:58] you can consider it as your death's well
[04:07] alright then
[04:10] you can send me in whichever war zone you want to
[04:13] I've also decided to win
[04:20] listen.. .
[04:25] are you with me?
[04:30] neither you'll get this answer so easily nor so quickly
[04:55] how are you?

[08:51] I don't know anything extra
[08:54] Okay

[08:59] what is going with Malpura?

[17:28] Farhad!
[17:32] Shahzain?
[17:34] Farhad, you!
[17:37] you've raised your hand on me for this lowly guy?
[17:42] Shahzain, I... 
[17:45] but why were you beating the kid?
[17:46] he had spilled the entire tea on me, also he isn't taking the order properly. What else I shall do?
[17:50] so what's wrong? He made a mistake, why did you beat him?
[17:58] be thankful that you are my brother-in-law
[18:01] otherwise, I would have told you!
[18:07] Farhad.. Farhad!
[18:09] he is your brother-in-law!

[18:12] is this Kiran's choice?
[18:14] leave it, we have a wedding in our house. What if it gets spoiled
[18:17] Jojo, he is walking red flag!
[18:19] can you see your red flags?
[18:21] even if I will show you a red flag, you won't be able to see it
[18:24] thank you, brother Farhad
[18:27] who does this for the people like us nowadays
[18:30] I will never forget this
[18:37] are you fine?
[18:38] yes brother
[18:40] come on go... 
[18:42] lets go from here
come on!
[18:47] Kiran
[18:50] what happened?
[18:52] what is this, Farhad?
[18:56] Shahzain, its hurting
[18:59] this pain is nothing, Kiran
[19:02] in front of the pain that your brother gave me
[19:04] what are you saying, what happened?
[19:21] so mom, tell me did you like anyone?
[19:25] I've shown you so many suitors
[19:27] there is a line of guys to become the son-in-law of Yousuf Motivala
[19:30] We've got the proposals of the sons of big businessmen
[19:34] any reply from Freeha?
[19:36] I don't understand this girl at all
[19:39] she rejects the guy as soon as she sees the picture
[19:42] mom, honestly speaking this girl has become her own enemy
[19:46] we aren't showing her any inappropriate proposals, we've shown her the best of all suitors
[19:53] yes, but she doesn't listen to me at all
[19:55] if I pressurize her, she runs to her father & complains about me
[19:59] then convince dad
[20:02] right aunt Shaggo?
[20:06] did you like any guy?
[20:08] guy?
[20:10] why would I like any guy?
[20:12] what rubbish you're talking?
[20:18] why, don't you want Freeha to get married?
[20:20] Freeha!
[20:23] Freeha...
[20:29] Freeha
[20:30] yes, who else?
[20:32] now we won't be discussing for your proposal in this age
[20:41] yes Shaggo, please talk to Freeha
[20:44] she considers you as her friend more than her aunt
[20:47] yes sister, let me explain her & talk to her
[20:51] excuse me...
[20:58] such a big example is present in our house
[21:01] and still you guys aren't afraid
[21:03] do you want her to stay at home unmarried like aunt Shaggo?
[21:07] God forbid! Why are you saying this?
[21:13] I must say, try to keep Freeha away from aunt Shaggo
[21:17] why?
[21:18] mom, you are so naive
[21:20] She considers aunt Shaggo her friend & her ideal
[21:25] you guys have such a big heart that you've accepted her once again after forgiving her
[21:31] if any girl would have done the same thing in our family, then they would have kept her away at an arm's length
[21:40] according to her, she is thinking about Freeha's betterment
[21:43] but don't know, what if she is brain washing her!
[21:49] otherwise, why is she refusing by just looking at the pictures?
[21:55] I think its something else
[22:33] Freeha...
[22:35] have you seen this video?
[22:42] this is the same guy...
[22:46] he seems like a hooligan to me from day one
[22:49] stay away from him
[22:50] this is the condition of our society
[22:52] the kid had spilled the tea by mistake so they've started beating her
See, how he is fighting!
[22:55] everyone thinks of them as a pharaoh
[22:57] but this guy has not only taught them a lesson but has also shown that humanity still exists
[23:03] first of all, we shall discourage child labor
[23:06] and if we see that someone is treating them badly, then please raise your voice
[23:10] protect them, the way this guy did
[23:14] don't get into all this
[23:17] don't know what is his background. He is wandering on the streets
[23:20] such guys like to become a hero!
[23:23] when did I say anything?
[23:25] you have shown me this video, I haven't said anything though
[23:28] don't know what you're thinking by yourself
[23:34] hey Shahzain... 
Kiran
[23:37] one minute...
yes Shahzain?
[23:42] ok fine, I've understood
[23:46] yes
[23:49] Okay, shall I call you back?
[23:52] I'll call you back
[23:54] Bye!
[23:56] Bye...
[24:01] was it Shahzain?
[24:03] yes
[24:06] what was he saying?
[24:07] he was saying... in fact he was telling me that how many people are coming from his side to attend the wedding
[24:14] didn't he tell you anything else?
[24:17] what else?
[24:23] Kiran, I..
[24:25] I wanted to tell you something...
shall I tell you something?
[24:29] Still I can't believe that I am getting married
[24:36] and this phone! Whenever this phone rings
[24:42] I feel anxious, that don't know what has happened now
[24:48] but see, thanks to God that everything is happening so smoothly
[24:52] and Shahzain!
[24:54] he is totally mad! Do you know what he was saying just now?
[24:56] he was discussing that which colors flowers will be decorated in the room
[25:03] its like, he wants me to come over there
[25:06] and I shall feel that I am coming into my own house
[25:10] Kiran, actually...
[25:11] hey... dear Kiran
[25:14] come dad
[25:15] this Mister is also here
[25:17] here you go
[25:19] this is for you, dear

[25:24] what's there?
[25:26] its a gold set for my daughter
[25:29] its so beautiful
[25:31] but its expensive as well, I am sure about it
[25:34] but its not expensive than our daughter
[25:36] what was the need for it? You guys already do so much for me
[25:39] what we've done? We have done nothing
[25:41] We really feel like doing a lot, but our pocket doesn't allow us
[25:47] See, I'm advising you. Please don't say such things
[25:52] you guys have always done more than our expectations, you have never given me a chance to complain
[25:55] so I'll get upset if you'll say such things
[25:57] do you like it?
[25:59] its best, and so beautiful
[26:03] so Mister?
[26:05] have you gifted anything to your sister or not?
[26:08] yes, I've ordered. Soon it will be delivered
[26:13] your brother is handicapped, he cannot visit the market for his sister
[26:19] he can only place an order by his phone & order non-sense things
[26:23] he will always stay stupid
[26:29] its your dad's choice
[26:30] why am I always insulted?
[26:34] Farhad...
[26:36] you know...
[26:39] explain him
[26:40] I haven't forgotten, ok? It will be delivered
[26:49] be careful about the flame, it shouldn't get low
[26:55] keep it appropriate, come on
[26:57] be quick, everyone
[27:01] hurry up, what is this drama?
[27:07] very good, be careful

[28:10] how can he go whiteout me? I've all his belongings
[28:14] oh wow! show me... shall I spoil it?
[28:22] oh brother Saleem, what do you do? At least, remove these curtains
[28:25] its a wedding house, and why do I have to tell everything
[28:29] hey he is here, be careful...
[28:31] do one thing, send the basket to the mosque & pick the religious scholar
[28:35] and and...  do ask about the rice pudding from Shamshad. Ok?
[28:37] I shall do everything, so what you're doing?
[28:39] what are you saying? I've got so much of work

[29:13] Kiran
[29:17] what happened?
[29:19] what is this, Farhad?
[29:23] oh this...
[29:25] who made this video
[29:30] and who had posted it on the internet
[29:31] yes, its had been viral as of yet
[29:37] listen, did Shahzain sent you this?
[29:39] No, my friends have sent me. When did it happen & why didn't you tell me?
[29:44] that night I came to tell you, but I thought if Shahzain haven't told you then lets end the matter
[29:50] its a small mistake
[29:51] small mistake?
[29:53] Farhad, this matter hasn't ended. It can be escalated!
[29:55] Shahzain didn't tell me, but what was the need for you two to fight like this?
[30:00] actually that day he got angry on the waiter, & I got furious on him
[30:05] but as soon as we saw each other, the matter ended there & then
[30:07] the matter is ended?
[30:09] then what is this video?
[30:12] yes?
[30:13] maybe Shahzain hasn't seen the video
[30:17] let me talk to someone & get it removed immediately
[30:19] Farhad...
[30:21] already this matter has been settled down with a lot of difficulty, what if something goes wrong then?
[30:26] why will anything happen?
[30:28] listen to me, they are about to come for the wedding ceremony. So get ready
[30:32] there won't be anymore issue about this matter, ok?
[30:36] if Shahzain would have seen it, then he might have said something
[30:42] I think, it didn't made any difference to him
[30:44] and if he haven't seen it, then lets get it removed timely
[30:48] I know a guy who is technical, he will do this work
[30:58] Kiran
[31:00] is Shahzain understanding?
[31:01] yes
[31:02] will he take care of you?
of-course!
[31:04] then why are you worried?
[31:08] and if he'll annoy you then I will...
[31:12] Farhad, stop it! I get tensed because of your these words & actions
[31:16] you've started again...
Ok sorry, I won't do any such thing
[31:19] happy?
[31:28] don't you worry at all

[35:23] but my sister was so angry with me
[35:25] why?
[35:27] actually that guy in the video was her fiance
[35:33] in fact, now he is her husband
[35:35] really?
[35:36] did you find that guy fine for your sister?
[35:40] No
[35:42] but she finds him well
[35:44] maybe I will never find any guy right for her
[35:47] as she is so nice
[35:49] nobody can be compatible for her
[35:53] is your sister happy?
[35:56] yes

[39:00] he hasn't done that deliberately. Farhad tried his level best to get that video removed from the internet
[39:05] what are you saying?
[39:06] whoever had to see that video, they've seen it
[39:11] but sorry to say...
[39:14] Sorry to say that my cousin had showed it to me after the wedding ceremony
[39:19] what if he has shown you before the wedding ceremony?
[39:24] if he would have shown me earlier
[39:27] then maybe Kiran you hadn't been here
[39:35] what!
[39:43] Shahzain
[39:46] Shahzain, don't escalate the matter. He hasn't done that deliberately
[39:50] Shahzain...
[39:50] he didn't even know who posted it
[39:53] do you think I'm such a big fool, right?
[39:55] Am I a stupid guy?
[39:57] your brother consider himself a very big hero
[40:01] I know this very well that he did all this deliberately!
no no...
[40:04] No no!
yes!
[40:05] No... Shahzain
just to insult me, nothing else
[40:07] first he had misbehaved with my parents, then he did drama with me
[40:10] no no, you know there isn't any such thing
its like that Kiran!
[40:13] absolutely
Shahzain
[40:15] but I won't sit in peace
[40:19] I will get him humiliated!
[40:23] I won't be satisfied until I don't get his video viral
[40:28] don't escalate the matter, Shahzain!
[40:31] Shahzain...
[40:43] mom
[40:45] mom, don't know what Shahzain is saying. Please make him understand
[40:50] we had tried to explain Shahzain a lot
[40:52] that he shouldn't get involved with the people like you
[40:56] but at that time, you had convinced him with your love
[40:59] but thanks God, now his eyes are opened
[41:02] mom, what are you saying? At least you can make him understand
[41:05] I've explained him. I've explained him in a very well manner...
[41:08] Shahzain will come inside the room, once we'll get the car
