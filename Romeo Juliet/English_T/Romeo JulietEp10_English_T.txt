[01:04] Shamshad we got less work done than last month.
[01:07] Hmm. People came for brother Yaqoob's name.
[01:12] Who is here to run the business now?
[01:15] A lot of our old clients have started taking orders from Biryani House.
[01:22] Hello.
Hello. Please sit down.
[01:32] What happened? Why do you seem worried?
[01:43] What happened?
[01:47] Actually, we have less orders now. No biryani orders at all.
[02:03] I was afraid of this.
[02:09] You people are experienced. You've been with dad since the beginning. Please tell me what to do.
[02:15] We're also thinking what should be done.
[02:23] Shamshad.. Shahzain sat here for a while. Lets call him here as well.
[02:29] He asked me if we needed any help.
[02:37] What happened? Why has Shahzain's name silenced you?
[02:47] Shamshad..
[02:54] Actually, Shahzain is Mr. Yaqoob's son in law. You're his son.
[03:01] It is our duty to tell you.
[03:06] What do you have to tell me?
[03:07] See I've always been loyal to brother Yaqoob.
[03:12] That's why I'm telling you.
[03:17] Actually when Shahzain was here, a lot of accounts were misled.
What?
[03:31] Did dad knew about it?
Yes. He had his doubts.
[03:38] But he often used to say that he might have made a mistake in the calculations.
[03:45] He never expressed his doubts but..
But?
[03:57] But?
I am not in a position to say this.
[04:05] I am sorry to tell you this but actually..
[04:12] I think Shahzain doesn't have good intentions.
[05:01] I'm coming.
[05:14] I'm coming.
[05:20] Come inside. I'm sorry I was chopping vegetables.
[05:28] The bell rang suddenly so I panicked. Sit
[05:31] Its alright if things get panicked.
[05:34] But people shouldn't have a problem.
What do you mean?
[05:39] Leave what I mean..
[05:43] There shouldn't be a problem between you and Farhad..
[05:51] Sister in law.. I don't know whether you and Farhad have fought about something..
[05:59] But I do know that he cannot live without you.
[06:08] Did he send you here?
[06:09] No. He doesn't even know I'm here. I wanted to talk to you.
[06:16] It doesn't seem so Jojo. You're always running away from me.
[06:21] See, I'll come straight to the point.
[06:24] I have never heard or seen the Romeo Juliet love story. I don't even understand it.
[06:33] But these Romeo and Juliet of Burns Road.. they're very close to my heart. I'm a fan.
[06:40] So I can't let it end tragically and if I have to interfere for it, I will.
[06:48] Thank you for worrying for us.
[06:53] Where is that idiot?
[06:55] He's a hard working boy. He must be at his catering house.
[07:01] Lets go and see how this hard working lad works. Will you take me there?
Sure.
[07:09] I'll just keep this and come. We'll go then.
[07:55] Sir, have you had your food?
[07:59] Yes.
Was everything okay?
[08:06] Yes.
Sir, bill?
[08:14] Sir, you ate here. You'll have to pay the bill.
[08:52] He's the SHO.. leave him..
[09:03] Bring him here.. Bring him..
Sir..
[09:10] Farhad?
[09:17] Where is Farhad?
He..
[09:20] The police took him.
Who?
[09:24] Farhad..
Why?
[09:26] He asked for the bill from the police officer and a fight ensued.
[09:32] Do you know which police station they took him to?
[09:34] The one near the market. The policemen must be from there.
[09:38] I'll go and see..
No. I'll come with you too.
[09:40] Can I come along too?
You stay here.
[09:48] Sir, my brother, Farhad.. Kareem Baksh Pakwan, did you bring him here?
[09:55] So his supporters are here as well?
Sir, please let him go.
[10:00] Sir he made a mistake.
Not a small but a big mistake. He showed a lot of attitude.
[10:06] Now let him live in the police station for a while. It will knock sense into him.
Sir..
[10:13] Sir see.. he's a kid. He doesn't know how things work here.
[10:18] We apologize for whatever he said.
[10:21] Things have gone beyond an apology now. If you want him out..
[10:25] Tell me what you can give.
What do you mean?
[10:31] Sir, please order..
Now we're talking.
[10:36] It will cost around 2-300,000.. What is this Jojo? This is unfair..
[10:43] Things will go wrong. Let me talk. Sir, his father passed away recently.
[10:51] And our catering house isn't doing well. It'll be difficult to arrange such a big sum.
[10:58] Please be mindful.
[10:59] See, your business has been running for ages. Have we ever asked for money earlier?
[11:04] Mr. Yaqoob had a great setting. He only took very little extortion money. Now you'll have to pay up.
[11:11] Sir, what are you saying..
Get the money and take your friend.
[11:18] Alright. We'll arrange the money until tomorrow morning. Can we meet Farhad now?
[11:25] Bring the money tomorrow and meet him then. Get lost now.
[11:29] I told you, you'd get the money by tomorrow.
[11:32] What do you think? I'll break the prison and take him away or will you hear and deliver my message? Should I?
[11:46] Ladies get emotional. We can understand.
Of course.
[12:04] What are you doing here? You could have sent Jojo or Shamshad with the bail money.
[12:08] Jojo is here.
[12:13] Look at them. They didn't pay the bill first and when I asked for it, they shut me behind bars.
[12:22] Farhad, you're new in the catering business but you're not a new born.
[12:27] Don't you know what the police does?
[12:30] Why did you have to argue with them?
[12:33] I cannot tolerate something wrong. You know it very well.
[12:39] You cannot tolerate a lot of things these days, Farhad.
[12:43] But can you still not see where your anger has brought you.
[12:47] How far will you go?
[12:50] You were always the one with the rules. You loved when I fought for others.
[12:56] What happened now?
[12:59] Farhad, there is time to pick a fight.
[13:02] You have to stop and pause at times to think how will your decisions affect others.
[13:09] We're not kids who roam around on bikes. We're married.
[13:14] And your wife is standing in front of an ill mannered policeman for you bail. Do you even care?
[13:21] So you shouldn't have come here.
[13:23] You're right. I shouldn't have come here.
[13:31] Your bail will not be granted before tomorrow morning.
[13:35] What?
[13:38] Tomorrow morning?
[13:42] And I think its right. Spend a night here and think who you're fighting.
[13:49] The one you should be fighting for.. our relationship.. you're trying to end it yourself, Farhad.
Please...
[13:58] I'm in no mood to hear your lectures.
[14:01] Alright. Stay here and enjoy!
[14:37] I'm sorry. I asked you the money in an emergency. I know it won't be easy to arrange it immediately.
[14:46] Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[14:52] My friend has bothered you a lot.
[14:56] Jojo, do you know what? Your friend needs anger management.
[15:02] I'm scared now.
[15:05] It seems he's on a mission to destroy himself.
[15:09] Why is he entangled in a self destructive behavior? First he fought in his office and now this..
[15:17] I'll make him understand but first let him come out.
[15:21] Alright. I've arranged for the money. We'll get it in the morning.
[15:25] Yes I too have talked about it.
[15:28] I pray to God something happens.
[15:29] Jojo its okay. Its not your responsibility. Don't worry. I've arranged. Please drop me home now.
[15:38] Alright. Lets go.
[15:59] Kiran?
[16:02] What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
[16:06] Come down. Give me your hand. Come down.
[16:14] Who told you to do all this?
[16:22] I cannot see you in pain. I really feel painful.
[16:35] I'm sorry.
[16:39] I don't know what happens to me when I'm angry. I don't understand anything. I lose myself.
[16:50] Forgive me please. You know I'm not a bad man.
[16:58] A person only gets really angry on the person he loves the most.
[17:06] I love you..
[17:14] Please forgive me.
[17:20] Oh.. where are you going? I'm being so romantic and you're leaving?
[17:28] I was going to cook. Mom will be upset.
[17:33] You don't have to. I'll talk to mom. The kitchen chores will be done.
[17:40] And I'll do all this organizing of the wardrobe. You don't worry.
[17:47] Lets do one thing. You get some rest.
[17:52] Then we'll go for dinner.
Dinner?
[17:57] Yes.
[18:00] I want to talk to you today.
Talk about what?
[18:07] About our future. What we have to do in the future?
[18:11] How will we move ahead?
[18:17] And if we have children tomorrow, what sort of a life will we give them.
[18:27] Its good to see you smile after so many days.
[18:41] But why are you quiet? I'm the only one speaking continuously. You say something too.
[18:47] I don't understand what to say.
[18:54] Please stay the same Shahzain..
[18:59] Just the same..
[19:06] It depends upon you, my life.
[19:12] Come on.. get ready and then we'll go. I'll go freshen up.
[20:03] Are you alright?
Hmm..
[20:09] Waiter?
[20:16] My wife is the guest of honor today. You'll bring whatever she says.
[20:23] Tell me what do you want?
[20:27] Anything..
[20:28] How can it be anything? Look at it and tell me what do you want.
[20:34] Should we have Chinese or desi? In fact, we have desi every now and then. We have a catering house.
[20:41] I think we'll order Chinese. I'll see. Okay..
[20:48] One fried rice with chicken chowmein and..
[20:55] this black pepper manchurian. I think its enough. Please hurry up. We're hungry.
[21:04] Isn't it a good place?
Yes.
[21:08] You do know how much I love you?
[21:13] See, I cannot see you in pain.
[21:18] But everything happens because of you. I'm your husband.
[21:25] And I do whatever I do for our future.
[22:03] Shaboo..
[22:18] This.. finish this teenage beauty tantrums. What do you have against food?
[22:27] You haven't eaten or talked to me since morning.
[22:32] There's a problem.. You want me to dance around the house?
[22:40] I didn't say that.. You don't have to dance but you can laugh and talk to me.
[22:47] You tell me.. after what happened in the morning, is there something to laugh and talk about?
[22:57] Shaboo.. you know everything and yet you're acting as if you don't know anything. Its neither yours nor their mistake.
[23:04] No Ahmed. Its all my fault. It was my fault in Saqib's matters and,
[23:12] And its my fault in Farhad's problems as well.
[23:15] You're mistaken Shaboo. Its not the case.
[23:20] Did you see how Farhad talked to me?
[23:26] He was misbehaving. He didn't even bother that you were there.
[23:30] I saw and heard everything.
[23:33] Even I didn't like how he talked and I'm upset. He should have shown some cordiality.
[23:43] But Shaboo.. I think we should give some margin to Farhad. He has become very sensitive about things.
[23:55] And the sympathy you showed him, he's looking at it in an incorrect manner.
[24:01] What does being sentimental mean?
[24:04] Isn't he looking at his own attitude. He misbehaves with us.
[24:09] He misbehaves with Fariha. God forgive us but their natures are poles apart.
[24:18] Our Fariha isn't like this.
[24:20] Shaboo, you're right but we don't have to be emotional about it. We have to be sensible.
[24:29] Ahmed.. I'm feeling anxious. What if..
[24:35] something bad happens?
[24:37] Nothing will happen Shaboo.. Do one thing, have your tea.
[24:43] Your mind is heated up like tea. Drink it and relax. Cool down. As it is, Shaboo..
[24:53] You are elder than the two of you. You'll have to do something. They're young.
[25:00] They don't look at life like us. They'll need time to understand things.
[25:08] And we're here to forgo everything.
[25:13] By the way, this tea is good. Did you make it or did Basharat?
[25:18] I made it for you with my own hands.
[25:22] Why didn't Basharat make it?
[25:25] I told him a couplet and he left.
[25:32] He didn't even compliment you?
[25:59] Isn't Fariha here?
No..
[26:04] Why would she come? She could only taunt me.
[26:10] I was in the prison all night. Did she even bother?
[26:15] What would she do coming here?
[26:17] Would she do charity for you? You're coming back from prison. Not a battle.
[26:24] Should she welcome you with open arms? If I could, I'd have brought a necklace made of slippers for you.
[26:30] I'd have knocked some sense into you.
What nonsense is this?
[26:35] Do you even realize how worried she is? She's all alone. She left everything for you.
[26:43] But you didn't even think about it once. How would she have managed to arrange 300,000 for your bail?
[26:53] 300,000?
Yes. I heard her talking to someone for the money.
[27:02] Who was she talking to?
I don't know. Someone from the family, maybe.
[27:09] Now her family knows that I was in jail all night. She knows very well I wouldn't want a favor from her family.
[27:17] So you take a favor from me as well.
Jojo its different about you.
[27:21] Whats different about me? You're not doing good with yourself or with her either.
[27:30] Think about it. Where could she have arranged 300,000 in a night? She would have had to ask. She had to manage something.
[27:40] We'll give it back to them. Right now focus on your sinking catering house. Come now.
[28:27] When did you come, Farhad?
[28:31] Sorry, I came back in a night. You wanted me to spend a couple of nights.
[28:38] I thought you'd be back with some regrets.
[28:44] There are a lot of regrets, Fariha..  
[28:48] You have them..
[28:51] What do you mean, Farhad?
[28:57] Fariha, I'll ask you once and answer me truthfully. Did you take money from your family for my bail?
[29:10] Farhad..
Did you take money from your family for my bail or not?
[29:19] It would have been better if I had stayed in jail.
[29:23] What nonsense is this? What is this attitude?
[29:27] You talk about your self respect. 
[29:29] Tell me. When we came in this house, didn't you ask Jojo for money for the rent and groceries?
[29:36] Jojo is different.
Didn't your ego come in between then?
[29:39] Jojo is different..
You weren't a hypocrite then!
[29:42] Jojo is different!
I didn't ask anyone for a favor Farhad!
[29:47] That was my fixed deposit money. I told you earlier but do you even listen to me?
[29:54] You told me to save that money, we'd need it in difficult times. 
[29:57] I didn't know that difficult time would be to get you out of jail.
[30:03] Yes. I'm a loser. You also tell me. I've spoiled your life. You're regretting marrying me.
[30:11] Farhad, you don't have to talk on my behalf. I'm tired of hearing this. You're insecure yourself.
[30:18] Yes I am insecure. I am a hypocrite. I'm useless. 
[30:22] I beg people for money because I cannot earn myself. Is there anything else left to say?
[30:29] Can you talk like a mature adult?
[30:32] Yes. I'm immature as well. Tell me more..
[30:38] You're really very immature Farhad. That's it.
[30:41] Do you even realize what I'm going through?
[30:50] My father is dead. 
[30:54] And I'm trying my best to take care of everything since then but nobody bothers.
[31:03] Neither my family, nor this world. And not even you. 
[31:07] I'm fighting a new battle outside, everyday.
[31:11] The problems, the arguments that I've never let touch you.
[31:16] And all this so that you can tell me how insecure and immature I am? I'm tired.
[31:22] I'm tired of my life. 
[31:25] But this isn't important. What is important is that I left my dirty towel here!
[31:32] And Fariha, you said, you'd throw it. Why didn't you?
[31:36] Why didn't you throw it? I'll throw it. And these dirty clothes. I'll throw them too
[31:41] Stop it Farhad!
[31:45] Farhad please..
I don't want to talk!
[33:20] Dear? Dear....
[35:33] So what have you thought about your grandchild's name?
[35:37] Let the day arrive and we'll think of a name as well.
[35:42] As God wills. Ever since Shabboo found out, she has brought all the wool yarns out. She's knitting sweaters.
[35:51] She's making tiny booties.
[35:57] Shaboo is an expert with all this. She made these for all of our children.
[36:04] Yes of course.
[36:06] Brother, I was young then.
You're still the same.
[36:12] How time flies. We don't even realize. Children grow up but we never stop worrying.
[36:21] Its alright. When he becomes a father, he'll understand me.
[36:28] Then we'll see.
Let it be. Focus on the happy occasion.
[36:35] Yes of course.
[36:39] I'll see..
[36:45] Fariha? What happened to you?
[37:04] What happened?
[37:08] What happened to you? Fariha? What happened dear?
[37:17] What happened my dear? Tell me what happened?
[37:23] Come and sit here..
[37:31] What happened? Dear? Tell me..
[37:42] Fari, how did this happen? Who did this? Tell me my child..
[37:49] He must have done it. Whats his name? Farhad! I'll not spare him. I'll draw his blood.
[37:56] How dare he raise his hand on my daughter?
[37:59] Fariha, you should have come back with us that day.
[38:03] She's bleeding.
[38:06] Don't worry dear. Your father is alive.
[38:10] Yes. Lets go home with us. You don't have to go there.
[38:18] Take Fariha inside. Clean the wound. I'll call the doctor. She needs rest.
[38:23] Go dear.
[38:28] Lets go.
[38:34] Oh my God.. I won't spare him.
[38:36] I'll not spare him.
[38:37] Brother Yousuf, relax. We'll see what we should do.
[38:42] Oh God...
[38:47]  I'll be back in a minute.
