[18:38] Jojo!
[18:40] what happened?
[18:44] what happened?
[18:45] who did this?
such a bad scene has happened
[18:48] her brother came in the gym, with so many goons
[18:54] they have ruined my entire gym
[18:58] they are looking for both of you like crazy people
[19:01] I've left from there with a lot of difficulty while saving my life
[19:06] whatever you've planned for next, you have to do it quickly
[19:11] what will happen now?
[19:16] I am asking the question here
[19:19] where is Farhad?
[19:21] how dare you to enter my house?
[19:23] hey!
[19:26] be thankful that I came here alone, the police didn't come
[19:43] your father isn't well since Farhad had gone
[19:48] but he never tells me
[19:49] he just fights on petty matters & get angry
[19:53] and then go inside to lye down

[26:27] you were so hungry?
nobody feeds you? come on
[26:32] here you go, what is your name?

[26:52] what do you think, what kind of a father I am?
[26:56] you are the best, dad 
very nice
[27:02] if you love your father even a bit and you honor my respect a bit
[27:08] then don't do any drama
[27:11] I beg you... please
[27:15] No please.. no
[27:25] the noise will be made now, dad
as your daughter has eloped from the house
[27:34] in previous times, fathers used to bury their daughters alive
[27:39] but now, daughters bury their fathers alive
[28:21] sister...
[28:23] actually the groom's family wanted to speak to you
[28:29] what will I talk to them?
[28:31] they wanted to bring Freeha's wedding gifts
[28:35] they want to give it to Freeha themselves, as its their traditional ritual
[28:39] so make an excuse, for sure Saqib will bring a good news
[28:43] he is out since morning to find her
[28:47] after all, until when we are going to stall them
[28:49] we have only tomorrow's day, as wedding is day after tomorrow. What if we won't be able to find Freeha till then?
[28:53] we'll see it later
[28:55] until then handle them
[28:58] and can't you even do this much?
[29:05] brother, we'll find her
[29:10] she will realize her mistake
[29:17] I don't know
[29:20] I know nothing
[29:48] don't advocate from his side at all, got it?
[29:57] I have always ignored & forgiven his every mistake
[30:00] but I had never thought that the matter will reach to this extent
[30:03] give him a chance to clarify his position once
[30:06] what? That guy's men are keeping an eye on my house. Anytime it will become a police case
[30:14] and where is he, with which girl he is. Do you know anything?
[30:17] to whom shall I give a chance to clarify? At least, bring him here
[30:25] also that Jojo is missing
[30:27] he must have escaped with him. I will thrash both of them very badly
[30:33] for a girl, he didn't even think that how we'll feel
[30:37] that's the problem, Ms. Shamim. He never thinks
[30:40] he thinks he is so sensible, later we have to face the consequences
[30:47] be generous now
[30:49] you've lost your son
[30:52] a person who couldn't become of his parents then how will he become of someone else?
[30:59] even I had bowed down in front of my parents will. I got married to you
[31:06] did I fulfill the responsibility or not? everyone does that.
Is he someone special?
[31:16] listen to me
[31:19] now whether he wanders on the road or stays in the prison, I don't care
[31:25] I couldn't teach him anything
[31:27] now I think he will learn by this way
[32:04] hello!
[32:04] Farhad, where are you? Do you have an idea that what you've done
[32:10] Kiran, I didn't had any other way out
[32:12] listen to me, are you in your senses?
[32:15] do you have an idea my brother, what you've done & what a big trouble has arise because of your action?
[32:22] I haven't told you so that it won't be a problem for you
[32:27] the problem has already arise, ok?
[32:30] Freeha's brother came to our house door while searching for both of you
[32:35] he entered our house with his men, he searched the entire house
[32:41] what do you mean that he had misbehaved?
[32:43] honestly, you were thinking that you'll do such a big silly mistake & it won't affect us?
[32:54] I will see all this later
[32:56] give me only one day's time, I will fix everything!
[33:00] really! ok, what will happen in one day?
[33:06] Farhad, for God sake don't do any such thing that we have to bear its consequences for lifetime, Ok?
[33:16] Kiran, I am already so tensed right now. I need your support at this time
[33:20] listen to me very calmly
[33:23] lets meet, we'll sit & talk. I want to see you, please send me your address
[33:28] I will come, we'll sit & talk peacefully. Ok? relax
[33:49] whose phone it was?
[33:52] it was mom
[33:57] mom?
[34:00] Shahzain
[34:02] you will lie to me for that disgusting man
[34:06] he is my brother
[34:09] he is in trouble
[34:11] he has made all these troubles for himself
