[00:13] Farhad, I am all alone here for an entire day 
[00:16] at least, come home on time at night please
[00:21] I've gone for a single day only, I don't go on daily basis though
[00:24] you are upset upon the fact that I haven't become your slave? 
[00:27] Shameless! Whatever I have, will I take it all to my grave?
[00:33] its all yours!
[00:37]  I wanted to teach you
[00:39] I wanted to make you capable enough so that you can handle it
[00:41] I have been ignoring all of your actions till date by considering you an elderly person
[00:46]  but today, you've crossed all the limits
[00:49] you hate me so much that you didn't care about the rest of the people living in this building 
[00:54] you didn't even think that tonight is so special for them
[01:11] aunt Shaggo, I can't tell you that how happy I am for you
[01:15] and I pray so much for yours & brother Hamid's future
[01:24] Fareeha, all of my happiness is incomplete without you. My love...
[01:34] So, will I be able to attend your wedding?
[01:41] honestly speaking, brother Yousuf & his wife is so angry right now
[01:48] and Saqib
[01:51] you know his anger very well
[01:54] he is upset with me as well
[01:57] both of them are not attending my wedding as well
[02:00] but let me talk to Hamid
[02:07] Fareeha, I feel so happy today after seeing you here
[02:13] I feel like taking you back with me by gathering you in my arms
[02:19] tell me something
[02:21] does Farhad loves you?
[02:25] Farhad takes very good care of me
[02:29] Fareeha, tell him to shift at some good place
[02:34] No, its not a problem. Actually we got this place in a hurry
[02:40] but we are planning, soon we will shift
[02:45] remember my words
[02:48] if you ever need anything, then you will call me
[02:52] not them
[02:55] Fareeha, never consider yourself alone. We are there for you
[02:59] thank you Zara
[03:03] aunt..
yes?
[03:04] mom is calling, we shall leave now
[03:07] lets go!
why so early?
[03:09] we'll come again
[03:11] we'll come, ok?
[03:15] keep this
[03:16] no, no aunt... I don't need it
[03:20] be quiet, & don't argue with me
[03:23] but aunt...
you might need it
[03:26] aunt...
keep it as a gift from my side
[03:31] take care of yourself, ok?
[03:34] Ok, wait for a while let me call Farhad. You haven't met him properly though
[03:39] No Fareeha, we'll meet him next time as we are getting late right now
[03:44] you know what must be going on over there
[03:48] yes
[03:49] will we take the cups along with us?
[03:51] lets go!
give me, let me keep them
[05:15] my entire family has gone & you are sitting here
[05:18] you didn't come to meet them properly
[05:21] they came to meet you, that's enough
[05:23] they came to meet us, Farhad
[05:27] No Fareeha, they didn't come to meet us
[05:31] in fact they came to see that in what condition I've kept you here
[05:36] what was their perception about our house?
[05:41] they couldn't come upstairs
[05:44] of-course, we don't worth it
[05:49] don't think this way
[05:54] that's why they gave you the money
[06:00] you couldn't come in front to meet them, but you could spy on me secretly right?
[06:09] I couldn't gather the courage, Fareeha
[06:13] I couldn't gather the courage after seeing this
[06:16] why did you take the money from them?
[06:19] Farhad, aunt Shaggo gave them to me forcefully. I couldn't refuse
[06:26] couldn't you return as well?
[06:30] Farhad , I had thought of returning it but aunt Shaggo didn't agree
[06:34] she was in a hurry, as she was leaving. Then I thought of returning it later
[06:38] what else I could have done, tell me?
[06:39] you shouldn't have taken the money from her!
[06:44] Fareeha, I know that I am unable to give you the luxuries that your family used to give you
[06:48] and this thing eats me up everyday from within
[06:51] Farhad, what have I asked you?
[06:55] these are your own insecurities
[06:57] yes, I do have
[06:59] I am stuck in a useless job, so that I can give you a better lifestyle
[07:02] don't you need a better lifestyle yourself?
[07:04] why are you blaming me? Are you doing this job because of me?
[07:07] yes, I am doing it for your sake
[07:12] I mean, I am doing it for you
[07:16] Fareeha, my manager punishes me for doing good work
[07:20] he had made me an office boy
[07:22] he asks me to bring tea & coffee for the guests
[07:25] I would have kicked this job long time ago if I didn't had your responsibility on me. But I cannot do this
[07:30] because I am stuck
[07:33] you got stuck with me?
[07:37] Fareeha, I didn't mean that & you know it
No...
[07:39] you don't need to say anything anymore
[07:42] and I am so sorry that you have to do this job because of me
[07:46] but its ok, you don't need to take my burden anymore because I can take care of responsibility. Thank you!
[07:52] Fareeha, don't take my words in a wrong manner
[08:11] is everything okay?
[08:12] do you know, where your son is living?
[08:15] how would I know?
[08:17] I just met that wretched guy!
[08:21] he doesn't have a bit of regret, he stands so confidently in front of me
[08:25] he didn't lowered his gaze even a bit in front of his father
[08:27] He could see that his father was busy in serving the food from the caldron
[08:32] he doesn't even realize a bit, is this what you call a support?
[08:36] Okay, please sit
[08:39] I shall sit!
[08:41] move away
[08:47] Shamim look, my arms doesn't have anymore power
[08:53] my arms starts shivering after making tens of cladrons
[08:59] if this will be continued
[09:02] then all my hard work of years will go in vain
[09:08] I don't have any support system, although I am a father of a son
[09:11] why are you saying such things? May God bless you with long life
[09:15] that Shahzain was looking after everything in my absence
[09:19] and I had made him upset too
[09:21] I will go to him & apologize
[09:26] now he will take care of you all after me
[09:29] what's wrong with you today? Why are you saying such things?
[09:32] I will go & talk to him
[09:36] Okay
[09:38] Yaqoob...
[09:58] what do you think, Shaggo?
[10:03] will it be okay for Fareeha to attend the wedding?
[10:08] Hamid...
[10:11] my heart says that she should attend our joyous occasion
[10:24] but...
[10:28] my brains says "No"
[10:36] by the way, its quite weird that
[10:39] your niece wants to attend the wedding, but the doors are closed for her
[10:43] while we are requesting your nephew over there, but he doesn't want to come
[10:54] I think, Fareeha should come
[11:01] but...
[11:03] brother Yousuf?
I will handle brother Yousuf
[11:07] really?
[11:08] I will handle him
[11:48] until when you'll keep sitting like this?
[11:52] Fareeha
[12:00] don't do this
[12:02] look here
[12:05] even you had so much yesterday in anger
[12:09] let it go
[12:13] please
[12:17] Farhad, I didn't intend to keep aunt Shaggo's money
[12:21] I also have that much of self-respect
[12:27] a lot is happening in your office, so why don't you tell me?
[12:30] why don't you share it?
[12:33] Fareeha, what's the use of worrying you?
I am handling it
[12:38] but there is no need to handle it all alone
[12:42] talk to me, tell me
[12:46] whenever anything happens, I feel like you are going away from me instead of getting closer
[12:53] Fareeha, there isn't any such thing
[12:56] its just that right now our hard time is going on
[13:00] but it will be fine
[13:02] don't take tension, ok?
[13:06] Farhad, I fear that the level of frustration you are gathering in yourself
[13:11] it will come out on our relation someday, In fact its already affecting our relation
[13:20] Fareeha, as I said there isn't any such thing
[13:23] I am handling it
[13:35] I am getting late for office, so I am leaving
[13:37] Ok?
[13:43] bye!
[13:49] bye..
[14:00] brother, take these things & fruits inside
[14:02] Brother Yousuf said that you need to deliver it to Mr. Hamid's house in the evening
[14:05] come on, hurry up
[14:07] is there anything left to be done?
[14:15] Ramsha.. Saqib
[14:19] where are you guys going?
[14:23] we are going to stay at Ramsha's family for a few days
[14:27] Why? What happened?
[14:31] you guys shall do your wedding preparations, what if your enjoyment gets ruined because of us
[14:36] Saqib, dear am I committing such a big sin?
[14:43] anyone can do anything as per their choice. Who am I to interfere in anyone's matter?
[14:48] after all, we are not habitual of interfering in anyone's matter
[14:52] and over here, everyone has their own will
[14:55] therefore it would be better for everyone not to interfere in our matter
[15:02] Saqib, you might not remember
[15:06] when you were born
[15:09] I had distributed your sweetmeat bear feet
[15:14] I have done your brought up in my lap
[15:17] I had made the cake with my own hands on your every birthday
[15:21] I took care of your every happiness
[15:24] no matter if we don't agree with each others' decisions
[15:28] but we've always been attached with our hearts
[15:32] See, no matter if you don't agree with my decision
[15:36] but its not good to turn your face away
[15:40] you are right, relation changes
[15:42] and these childhood talks looks good in the childhood
[15:47] you used to make cake for me on my birthday
[15:51] and after Fareeha's birth, you used to make a separate cake for her on my birthday
[15:56] you used to get a better gift for her than mine
[15:59] and its happening till date
[16:01] nothing has changed now
[16:03] Fareeha is given more importance here in every matter
[16:08] Saqib, she is your little sister...
I haven't changed the relations
[16:12] you guys did
[16:17] you guys have distanced me from yourself
[16:20] its better for me to stay away from you people
[16:22] lets go!
[16:23] Saqib, listen to me...
Sister...
[16:38] hey! what are you doing here?
[16:43] whatever spectacle you've done, isn't that enough?
[16:49] get out of here
[17:14] coming...
[17:22] you!
[17:24] what work do you have?
[17:26] I want to talk to you, may I come in?
[17:34] please come
[17:40] here...
[17:46] Wow! you've decorated your house very well
[17:50] Very nice!
[17:53] please sit
[18:03] sit down
[18:05] tell me
[18:07] sit
[18:12] don't be afraid
[18:15] I don't bite
[18:29] I am so embarrassed about that day
[18:35] I came to apologize to you, please forgive me
[18:48] do you know...
[18:50] I am exactly like you, in fact you are like me
[18:57] when I & Mr. Agha came here
[19:08] there was nothing
[19:10] Mr. Agha used to work in the factory
[19:15] and I used to take care of the house
[19:18] while taking care of the house, I thought of doing something else
[19:23] then...
[19:27] I started to solve the issues of the people living here
[19:32] I used to teach the kids, and kept on doing something
[19:35] I thought, since I have time so i should do it
[19:40] while doing it, one day everyone made me the president of the building committee
[19:50] Wow! what a respect they gave me
[19:58] I got an identity, and I became habitual of it
[20:00] the environment got a bit disturbed when you came here, so..
[20:05] I started to get a bit afraid
[20:11] but I don't want to snatch all this from you
[20:13] I know that
[20:17] you become habitual of the identity
[20:21] and you need courage to break this habit
[20:25] and I was looking for that courage
[20:31] its the rule of this world, one has to come forward & take care of the work
[20:39] it won't work with me for an entire life time
[20:44] anyways, I do understand your problems
[20:49] don't worry
[20:51] but my objective is not this
[20:54] I know you don't have this objective
[20:59] you are so sensible
[21:02] you will make your life, also you will find your objective too. I know!
[21:08] you are the girl of this modern era
[21:12] not like us...
[21:16] I thought to come today & discuss it with you
[21:21] lets end this enmity, battle & this fight
[21:24] lets be friends, what do you say?
[21:27] yes?
[21:29] obviously, we have to live together. This entire neighborhood is family
[21:38] yes?
[21:41] I forgot to say the actual thing
[21:44] from now on, you have to collect one thousand rupees from every house
[21:48] why?
[21:49] Why! What do you mean by that?
 its your idea
[21:51] We need dustbins, solution for the mice. We need cleanliness
[21:56] and it would be expensive to do all this
[21:58] its your responsibility now
[22:00] I will tell everyone that we got such a great change because of you
[22:07] everyone will be happy
[22:10] I came empty hands, sorry
[22:13] I will bring something next time
[22:18] Ok? I am leaving now
[22:47] hey dad! Greetings...
[22:50] greetings!
[22:51] dad, is everything fine? How come you are here all of a sudden?
[22:55] yes, everything is fine thanks to God
[22:58] actually you had gone without having lunch on that day then we couldn't meet. So, I wanted to meet you
[23:05] I hope you are not upset
[23:07] No dad, why will I be upset with you?
[23:11] I just felt a bit hurt on that day, nothing else
[23:15] dear please forgive me, I shouldn't have talked to you in this manner
[23:23] you are the only person, on whom I can trust
[23:28] in fact, I want you to handle my catering business now
[23:33] but dad, I work in a bank. How can I handle it?
[23:38] I don't trust anyone else except for you
[23:42] and nobody else has an interest in it
[23:44] So, I don't want my hard work to get ruined for my generations after my demise
[23:49] and Karim Baksh's name shall be vanished
[23:51] oh dad, why are you saying such things now?
 You have to do a lot more
[23:55] oh dear, its very important to say such things with time
[24:02] and now my situation is as such that its important for me to discuss such things
[24:11] our elders used to say, that one's own business is great!
[24:17] you can continue with your bank's job, but you should have your own business as well
[24:22] because one's own business is beneficial for the generations
[24:28] promise me
[24:30] you will never let Karim Baksh's name get vanished
[24:36] dad, don't you worry. I won't let this happen
[24:40] Greetings dad! when did you come?
[24:43] Greetings! I just came a while ago
[24:44] are you fine? Is mom fine?
[24:46] I am so happy today
[24:49] Shahzain has promised me that he won't let Karim Baksh's name get vanished
[24:56] Soon I will get the documents ready
[24:58] which documents, for what? What are you doing?
[25:01] by the way dad, its not required
[25:05] but you know in our bank they suggest you to do all these things first
[25:11] we cannot trust our life though
[25:13] and in our country they ask you to wander around for years, if there is no proper paper work
[25:17] then what will be left in the business?
[25:19] yes
[25:25] what happened to you?
[25:26] nothing dad
[25:28] actually I had slipped in the house, that's why
[25:33] so why didn't you tell us?
[25:35] dad, what I would have told you?
Its nothing just a small injury
[25:38] oh dad, I tell her not to show so much haste while working
[25:42] she should walk slowly & do everything properly. But she doesn't listen to me at all
[25:46] now see, you had slipped. Try to listen to me as well
[25:51] are you fine dear?
[25:56] I am absolutely fine dad
[25:57] you get worried & mom starts lecturing me that's why I haven't told you
[26:02] nothing else
[26:04] Okay, but do take care of yourself
[26:09] I am leaving now
[26:11] oh dad, at least drink tea
Go
[26:14] drink tea before leaving
What? no..
[26:16] please wait, let me prepare tea
[26:18] No, I don't feel like drinking the tea
[26:21] I am feeling anxious, I will leave
[26:23] Okay?
take care
[26:26] let me see you off
[26:30] convey my regards to mom
[26:31] what?
[26:32] convey my regards to mom
okay
[26:35] yes
[27:06] hey, what are you doing? Where were you since morning?
[27:10] I was here, where else I would be?
[27:13] Boss had asked me to get the prints of all the documents
[27:20] Boss is not leaving that topic
[27:24] how much of your work is done?
[27:26] not even half of it is completed
[27:29] Farhad
[27:31] what is this?
[27:33] what happened, Sir?
[27:34] which prints you've given me?
[27:38] Sir, you had asked for these
[27:42] are you trying to act smart with me?
[27:45] No sir
[27:46] I had ask you to get me the prints of Global Tech
[27:51] you can't even get the proper printouts & your thinking is sky rocketing
[27:58] I want the correct prints right away!
[28:02] it should be on my desk within 5 minutes, is it clear?
[28:12] this bald man is playing games with me
[28:15] have you gone mad? What are you doing?
[28:18] now you'll go & tell him that he is doing wrong with you? He is your boss!
[28:21] what's the big deal if he is the boss?
[28:23] what does it mean, he can scold me off whenever he wants to. And I cannot say anything?
[28:27] for now you cannot
[28:30] he is pinching you deliberately you that you can react & he gets a chance to fire you
[28:34] then let him fire me!
[28:36] to hell with this job!
[28:40] really?
[28:41] what will you do then?
[28:45] you can resign with respect once you get another option
[28:51] you are kicking your fixed job uselessly
[28:54] you aren't a bachelor though, you have a wife at home
[28:58] it cannot happen that you shall leave your job & sit at home. Think a bit practically!
[29:16] take out the prints, why are you looking at my face?
[29:24] Yaqoob, the dinner is served
[29:31] Yaqoob?
[29:35] yes
[29:38] I have served the dinner
[29:44] I am not hungry
[29:53] what's the matter?
[29:56] I'm noticing that you are so worried since you came back from Kiran's house
[30:00] is everything fine over there?
[30:06] didn't Kiran told you that she got injured?
[30:10] Kiran got injured?
[30:12] how? where?
[30:16] when she got injured?
[30:18] She was saying that she had slipped while walking hastily
[30:22] she got an injury on her face
[30:26] so why didn't she tell me? I would have taken her to the hospital
[30:35] haven't you observed such an injury on her face earlier?
[30:41] No
[30:43] No, any other marks somewhere on her body
[30:48] No Yaqoob!
[30:51] why are you asking such kind of questions?
[30:56] those were the same marks you used to get, whenever I used to hit you...
[31:09] No...
[31:11] it wouldn't have happened
[31:14] she must be telling the truth that she got slipped
[31:18] she would have told me, if something would have happened
[31:22] anyways, take care of her and ask her to come to our house
[31:25] and do some rest
[31:39] Okay
[32:01] did you talk to them?
[32:05] really!
[32:07] aunt Shaggo, I love you, I love you! Thank you so much
[32:12] I'll see you soon
[32:14] Bye!
[32:17] it was aunt Shaggo's call
[32:19] what was she saying?
[32:21] she has talked to Hamid uncle & both of us can attend her wedding
[32:26] what did your parents said?
[32:30] they don't know right now
[32:33] what are you saying, Fareeha?
[32:35] how can we go then?
[32:38] you know your parents are angry with us
[32:41] why do you want to spoil your aunt's wedding ceremony uselessly
[32:43] No, Hamid uncle & aunt Shaggo will handle everything. They have said to me
[32:51] Fareeha, I don't think so that we should go there
[32:55] Farhad, please... she said that we both should come
[32:59] Fareeha, you can go there if you want to. But I won't go
[33:03] what are you saying?
[33:07] Fareeha look, its simple thing
[33:10] I got so much insulted by your family
[33:14] I haven't forgotten my insult as of yet
[33:18] and maybe you are forgetting that what your family had said to you
[33:21] they had closed the doors of that house on your forever, right?
[33:24] they were angry Farhad, and it takes time to accept all this
[33:29] they might not say anything on such an occasion
[33:32] Fareeha, maybe its their compulsion not to say anything
[33:35] but them & everyone present over there. I know it very well that what they are thinking about me
[33:42] Please, this is very important for me Farhad
[33:47] Fareeha, you may go if you want to
[33:49] I am done!
[33:52] I cannot get anymore insulted, sorry!
[33:55] Farhad!
[34:35] hey! what are you doing here?
[34:40] whatever spectacle you've done, isn't that enough?
[34:46] get out of here
[35:00] go away!
[35:10] Fareeha, wait
[35:14] actually...
[35:17] I have invited Fareeha, brother Yousuf
[35:20] why did you invite her?
[35:21] we have become habitual of living without her
[35:29] what's the big deal, Shaggo would have got married as well
[35:32] why did you invite her?
[35:35] Shaggo's big day would have stayed incomplete if Fareeha wouldn't have come
[35:39] brother Yousuf, please spit your anger for today
[35:44] for the sake of Shaggo, ok?
[35:50] Fareeha, go meet your aunt
[35:54] brother Yousuf
[35:56] I couldn't give a better wedding gift to Shaggo than this one
[36:00] let it be for today, please brother Yousuf
[36:26] Zara... Bilal
[36:36] you have come!
