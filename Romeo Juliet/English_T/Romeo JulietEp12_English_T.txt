[00:17] Please go for a few days.
[00:19] my worries will reduce, please Fariha
[00:22] Please go away for a few days.
[00:25] Mother will not eat without me.
[00:31] Alright...
[00:33] There is no need to worry.
[00:35] He's sad, he'll be fine
[00:39] What if he doesn't?
[00:43] There were a few things that I went to do, but now I'm back.
[00:48] You will not go back to you wife, promise me.
[00:52] Promise me... that you will not go.
[01:03] Many congratulations. Saqib gave me the good news.
[01:07] Thank you.
[01:10] But you were late to congratulate me.
[01:13] I thought you would distribute sweet meats as soon as you heard the news.
[01:16] Were you not happy to hear the news?
[01:19] Will you steal my happiness from me?
[01:22] Why do you want to take away my son and his children from us?
[01:26] I don't want to take them away from you.
[01:28] Ask Saqib why he wants to separate.
[01:32] I know who puts this in his heart.
[01:36] Yes it is always the daughter-in-law's fault.
[01:41] It is the responsibility of the daughter-in-law to keep the house together.
[01:47] I am the one who has supported you most in this house.
[01:51] I've thought of you like a daughter.
[01:54] Is this how you repay me.
[01:56] It would be better if you don't compare me to your daughter.
[01:59] As far as your as breaking your home is concerned, that's because of Saqib, don't blame it on me.
[02:06] If you want to talk about something, you can talk about it in front of him.
[02:10] Rimsha...
[02:14] Rimsha... what's the matter?
[02:18] Get up...
Are you alright?
[02:23] What happened to her? Get up.
[02:27] Be careful... what happened.
[02:32] Let's go to the hospital. I'll come with you.
[02:38] Ask her to stay away from me.
[02:40] What are you saying?
[02:42] She came to fight with me.
[02:47] We were arguing, but she got up and then fell.
[02:52] Alright fine... I fell... but I am not feeling safe with her
[02:57] What are you saying?
[02:58] You have it wrong...
Please take me to the doctor.
[03:02] Mother...
[03:03] there isn't any such thing
I didn't expect this from you.
[03:05] Mother... there is no need for you to follow us.
[03:09] Be careful.
[03:21] Rimsha..
[03:36] I want to talk to you uncle.
[03:38] I'm listening.
[03:41] Kiran called yesterday.
[03:49] She wants me to handle the catering business full time.
[03:53] She's right.
[03:56] Mother you know I have no interest in that.
[04:01] What are you saying then? Will your sister handle things with the caterer?
[04:05] Will you like that?
[04:08] Shah-Zain will look after it.
[04:14] Besides it's not in me...
[04:17] Kiran was being stubborn yesterday, that's why...
Don't you dare...
[04:21] Don't even think about giving Shah-Zain a single plate, let alone the entire business.
[04:25] He cannot be trusted.
[04:30] You are right. Have you forgotten how much dowry they asked us?
[04:37] After all that you guys wanted that marriage, right?
[04:44] Why are you saying such things now?
[04:50] Did something happen?
[04:54] Mother... did something happen?
[04:59] You tell me..
[05:03] I don't know. I have no idea.
[05:05] Nothing has happened, it's just we don't like him.
[05:10] Kiran was hiding something from me as well.
[05:14] Mother, tell me if there's something.
[05:17] Is that man troubling her?
[05:22] Is he asking for more things?
[05:25] Tell me, I'll set him straight!
[05:28] Nothing has happened. She's married now...
[05:32] She has other responsibilities.
[05:36] You're the son of this house.
[05:38] So being our son why would someone else run the business?
[05:47] At lease think of us now.
[05:50] Why are you being selfish?
[05:53] All of us need you.
[06:02] Have you decided then?
[06:08] Yaqoob Karim Baksh's catering business...
[06:11] will be handled by his son now...
[06:14] Right?
[06:21] It's settled then.
[06:50] Wait a minute...
[06:53] Greetings*
[06:57] I decided that we should eat this korma with you.
[07:00] It's good you did.
[07:03] Come in please... I didn't feel like making anything at home.
[07:11] Have a seat, I'll bring the plates.
[07:16] She didn't feel like eating, I'm sure there's some trouble.
[07:20] She does look worried.
[07:26] Here you are...
[07:32] Sit down.
Of course.
[07:34] Here you are.
[07:38] Your auntie like always has put two plates in front of herself.
[07:44] Here you are...
[07:47] Are you worried?
[07:51] Are you feeling well?
[07:53] We don't like you being silent like this.
[07:58] What can I do? I sit here alone all day, I over think then I get worried.
[08:04] Things like this happen. Let me tell you one thing...
[08:08] There is a fun of being alone, if only one could get the chance.
[08:15] What do you mean?
[08:17] Meaning... a few years ago...
[08:22] my mother called me back to Peshawar...
[08:26] There was no mobile phone or internet back then.
[08:32] Sometimes we used to talk and sometimes we wouldn't.
[08:34] It took me longer than expected at Peshawar...
[08:39] Your auntie thought that my mother had convinced me to stay.
[08:45] No only did I think that...
[08:48] It was his mother's wish to get him married there.
[08:52] But I didn't... I fell in love with you...
[08:57] I stopped eating. I didn't even eat my mother's cooking.
[09:01] I even told my mother that I will only live with Shanno.
[09:06] And I will only die with her.
[09:10] Anyways...
[09:12] What he means to stay... don't worry.. Farhad will be back.
[09:17] Where can he go but here?
[09:21] Thank you that you guys came here. I like spending time with you guys.
[09:27] Don't worry... we are always with you. Ok?
[09:31] Thank you... please start.
[09:34] Korma!
[09:50] What did the doctor say?
[09:54] She said that the child is fine and I am too.
[10:03] That's great news.
[10:07] I'm in pain..
[10:08] what does that doctor know about the amount of pain I'm in.
[10:12] Where are you feeling it?
[10:16] I got hurt in my arm.
[10:19] But when you sat in the car, you said that your leg hurt.
[10:23] Can't one hurt in one's arm and leg at the same time?
[10:26] No one believes me!
[10:29] I believe you.. do one thing...
[10:34] Improve your mood. And tell me what happened.
[10:42] Your mother came to my room and started to scold me.
[10:47] She told me that I was the one who forced you to separate our home.
[10:50] I asked her the reason why I would do such a thing.
[10:54] I've been living together for so many years...
[10:59] I was coming to you...
[11:02] Then I don't know what happened.
[11:06] All I know that she was very angry.
[11:09] I think your mother is jealous of our happiness.
[11:15] I thought that she would be happy to hear about her grandchild.
[11:21] But now... she still has complaints for us.
[12:08] I was waiting for you.
[12:11] It's good you're here.
[12:16] Now...
[12:18] Take over brother's place.
[12:22] Everything is how he left it...
[13:35] Look...
[13:37] I know that she's your mother.
[13:40] And you also know that I don't complain.
[13:44] But before this she's said a lot of thing and I've always ignored it.
[13:49] But it's about our child now..
[13:52] That's why I had to speak up...
[14:03] I don't want to go home.
[14:07] What do you mean?
[14:09] Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?
[14:15] I want to go to brother's home.
[14:18] What?
[14:21] I want to go to brother's home.
[14:26] I don't feel like going home.
[14:30] What if something happens to our child?
[14:34] I've told you so many times, you're my responsibility.
[14:39] But the rest of your family doesn't like me.
[14:42] Who does not like you?
[14:44] You and our child have the most right over that house.
[14:49] But...
No buts, don't worry about anyone. I'll take care of it.
[15:00] More than myself I care about this child.
[15:05] God has blessed us, but certain people will try to destroy it...
[15:08] To hell with them!
[15:11] I'll see how they will do that!
[15:14] I'll sort everyone out.
[15:18] Just don't worry.
[15:22] Let's have some coconut water, it will be good for the kid. Do you want some?
[15:28] Stop is here....
[15:53] Add a leg piece to it... how can I eat this?
[15:59] This is the customer's order! Have some shame!
[16:02] You have so much biryani.... so what if I take a leg piece?
[16:08] Give him some leg piece!
[16:18] Give me the fat one.
[16:27] Fate is a strange thing...
[16:31] All my life I ran away from this...
[16:36] and now I'm sitting here.
[16:38] There is a possibility that this might be good for you.
[16:40] Sometimes we must accept fate as it is...
[16:46] All my fate is biryani and korma...
[16:49] It's not like that, you have raita as well.
[16:55] And... you always said that uncle didn't listen to you.
[16:59] You wanted to change things around here. Change it then!
[17:04] This is your chance... use your business brain.
[17:09] Run it like you want to.
[17:14] No.
[17:17] This is not mine.
[17:21] All my life father didn't trust me.
[17:27] And after him I didn't want to come here either.
[17:33] It's only because of mother and Kiran otherwise...
[17:35] Why do you think so negatively?
[17:39] Use that as an opportunity. Show them that you could do it.
[17:49] I have to go home in the evening. Take care of everything in my absence...
[17:53] Alright I'll take care of it... don't worry.
[18:05] Did you want something?
[18:12] The catering house.
[18:16] What do you mean?
You know it very well.
[18:20] Did you talk to your brother?
[18:29] Rimsha say something.
[18:31] Saqib, what did the doctor say? Is everything alright?
[18:36] There is no need to worry... everything is alright.
[18:40] Thank God.
[18:43] I didn't push her my dear.
[18:47] She has a misunderstanding.
[18:49] Rimsha go and rest. The doctor has asked her to rest.
[19:01] I didn't expect this from you mother.
[19:03] I did no such thing Saqib.
[19:06] Why don't you believe me?
[19:10] You know that we got such great news after such a long time...
[19:15] And... when I heard that my grandchild wouldn't live with us here...
[19:22] I got angry.
[19:24] But... after hearing the good news you should have gone there to congratulate her...
[19:28] instead you argued with her.
[19:32] Why are you worried? Many congratulations!
[19:36] You've made me happy... you've given me great news!
[19:40] We're about to become grandparents. Forget everything else..
[19:45] Why are you sitting here?
[19:50] There is no need to worry. You've made me very happy!
[19:54] Congratulation my dear!
[19:58] Thank you...
[20:02] Bless you dear..
[20:06] Your father is right.
[20:08] We can't change the past. We'll discuss things later.
[20:18] Alright.
[20:21] Keep the vegetables on the table.
[20:31] Farhaad?
[20:34] You didn't tell me that you were coming.
[20:40] I felt like seeing you.
[20:46] You always said that you found peace looking at me.
[20:51] That you stop feeling tired.
[20:55] It is still like that?
[21:03] I'm very tired...
[21:08] People being upset with me...
[21:11] has tired me.
[21:23] I've always had complaints against him.
[21:31] But now that he's gone...
[21:35] I don't understand how to feel.
[21:41] I'm sad...
[21:44] I'm angry...
[21:48] And somewhere I feel guilty.
[21:54] It seems as though...
[21:57] a storm passed.
[22:00] And now there is silence everywhere.
[22:04] Farhaad...
[22:06] It hurts when we are away from the people we love.
[22:11] But we only be patient with the people who leave this world.
[22:21] Father gave the catering business to Kiran.
[22:27] And Kiran wants to me to take care of it.
[22:32] What should I do?
[22:37] Farhaad...
[22:39] I know that you wanted to do something else.
[22:44] But... who knows...
[22:47] It is possible that you'll get all you answers from that catering business.
[22:57] I'm not feeling well... 
[23:00] I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
[23:04] Sure go ahead.
[23:22] Believe me, ever since sister told me...
[23:26] I've been so happy. I couldn't stop myself.
[23:32] But I'm upset at all of you. 
[23:35] The Motiwala family is about to be blessed with a baby...
[23:40] and you guys haven't distributed any sweetmeats.
[23:45] You are their aunt, it's your responsibility to distribute it as well.
[23:49] That's true, I'll distribute to, like I did for Saqib.
[23:55] Believe me... you don't know the happiness you've given this family.
[24:00] I pray that child bless this entire family.
[24:09] Why are you here?
[24:11] Why are you speaking to me like that? I heard the news...
[24:17] So you decided to ruin it?
[24:19] No Saqib...
[24:22] You have it wrong. It's not like that.
[24:27] I thought that...
[24:32] it was great news...
[24:35] We wanted to congratulate you...
[24:37] Thank you very much for congratulating...
[24:42] You can go now.
[24:46] Alright fine... we'll leave, it's alright.
[24:54] May God bless you two.
[24:57] It's hard to stop oneself when it comes to family.
[25:02] That's why your aunt is sitting here. You have it wrong.
[25:10] May God bless you two. We'll get going.
[25:16] We'll meet brother Yousuf and sister downstairs.
[25:20] No... let's go home.
[25:27] Alright, we'll get going.
[25:44] Did you want something?
[25:52] The catering business.
[25:55] What do you mean?
You now what I mean.
[25:59] Did you talk to your brother?
[26:06] Tell him that you want to sell this catering business.
[26:10] Besides, he has no interest in this business.
[26:13] It is possible that he wants to further the business.
[26:16] Wait a second...
[26:17] What did you say?
[26:18] After father's death, Farhaad is taking the business and family seriously.
[26:22] If he's serious, then he should find something for himself. 
[26:26] This is not his decision to make.
[26:29] This decision can only be made by the one who owns the business.
[26:34] And you will do as I say.
[26:38] Right?
Sure.
[26:42] Not much time has passed since father's death.
[26:46] Everyone is grieving, how can I...
I don't care...
[26:51] I'm looking for a buyer, I'll sell it once I get a good deal.
[26:56] The most I can wait is for forty days.
[27:00] You can talk to whomever you want...
[27:04] whenever you want.
[27:25] Hello Kiran...
JoJo how are you?
[27:29] I'm well... I was going to work. How are you?
[27:33] How's Shah-Zain?
Everything's fine.
[27:39] Is everything okay?
[27:40] No, I wanted to discuss something with you.
[27:44] Sure what is it?
I have a request...
[27:49] I know Farhaad is trying with the catering business, but make him understand...
[27:55] how important the business is for us.
[27:59] He's working hard, all he needs is a little time.
[28:03] Everything is in front of you. He's taken responsibility of the entire business.
[28:10] It will take some time.
[28:13] You're right... 
[28:16] I'm worried all the time that he might do something...
[28:19] that might accost us and the business.
[28:25] Don't worry about that. I'm here.
[28:29] He's a better business man than me.
[28:35] Thanks.
[28:38] I've found strength after talking to you.
[28:42] Don't thank your brother.
[28:46] I'll hang up... we'll talk later.
[28:49] Take care... farewell.
[29:12] Farhaad my dear where are you?
[29:16] You know I can't sleep. Please come home.
[29:21] Auntie, greetings... 
[29:23] it's Freeya.
[29:27] What are you doing with my son's phone? 
[29:30] Have you no shame?
[29:32] Do you have any idea how much pain you're causing your parents?
[29:37] Why don't you leave? Send my son back!
[29:42] You're not married to him.
[29:47] I don't accept such a marriage. A marriage that was done in secret.
[29:54] Do you think marriage is a joke?
[29:59] Families get married... I don't accept it!
[30:03] Do you think that I'll bring you to my home as my daughter-in-law?
[30:08] You've destroyed our life... my husband is dead... you killed him.
[30:14] I will not make you part of my life.
[30:18] Send my son back! Go home!
[30:24] Don't take a mother's curse!
Auntie...
[30:58] Farhaad come home.
[31:25] Shaggo...Shaggo.
[31:32] You didn't say a word in the car... and now...
[31:43] What is there left for me to say or hear?
[31:48] These kids...
[31:51] don't know how to maintain relationships. What can I do now?
[31:57] You're right.
[32:00] But he's compelled by his anger.
[32:05] Am I responsible? 
[32:07] Did I ask Freeya to run away and marry someone?
[32:12] They didn't attend our wedding as well.
[32:16] Will he behave like that with me for the rest of his life?
[32:19] I went there with such affection.
[32:24] I thought that everything would be okay.
[32:29] Nothing is okay.
[32:36] Rather...
[32:38] I got you insulted as well.
[32:44] There is no need for you to worry about my insult...
[32:47] Shaggo... respect is in the hands of God.
[32:51] There is nothing in the hands of us humans. 
[32:54] I think that he'll get better.
[32:57] Soon he'll come running to you.
[33:03] I don't think he will. You didn't see his attitude.
[33:09] He was shouting at me.
[33:12] And.. his wife.
[33:15] she doesn't care.
[33:17] I'm telling you that he'll realize his mistake.
[33:22] And that won't take much time.
[33:27] Shaggo... I thought that...
[33:32] we would have dinner on our way back. But your mood...
[33:39] has killed my hunger.
[33:44] Call out your hunger!
I'm hungry!
[33:51] Do you want to eat at home or outside?
[33:56] I think...
[33:58] we should order it at home.
[34:01] Sure, I'll get the plates.
[34:35] Freeya...
[34:40] Did someone call?
[34:42] Your mother.
[34:46] Did you pick up?
[34:54] What did you say to her?
[34:58] Why was she surprised that you were here?
[35:02] Does she think that we've separated?
[35:05] No Freeya..
[35:08] Mother wants me to live with her. I'm just stalling.
[35:16] Without me?
[35:20] Your mother said that you could come back, but without me.
[35:25] But I refused. I said that I won't live without you. 
[35:30] You should have told her the same...
[35:34] There is a difference between your family and mine.
[35:38] Father just passed away, my mother is grieving...
[35:42] On top of that she's in depression. I can't bother her in her state.
[35:50] Will you continue doing this and I will remain your secret wife?
[35:55] You will come here whenever you want, otherwise you'll stay there. 
[35:58] Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to live here alone?
[36:02] Why are you living alone? 
[36:04] I've asked you to live with your aunt for a while.
[36:08] Farhaad... that is not my home.
[36:11]  I can live there as a guest for a few days, but not for the rest of my life... my home is here with you...
[36:19] We're husband and wife, we need to handle the situation together.
[36:25] Freeya... you can't understand my problems...
[36:30] And I don't want to discuss this please...
[36:34] Do you know what your problem is? You try to avoid every situation.
[36:39] I try to avoid it?
[36:43] Have some fear... that's  my family, I have to take care of their issues.
[36:49] You're one of their problem.
[36:51] Is there no solution to this problem?
[36:54] Let me know if you have any ideas, because I don't.
[37:00] What would you have done if your father had died?
[37:07] Freeya!
[37:12] I'm trying...
[37:15] But I can't take you there right now. Please understand this.
[37:42] Here you are.
[37:45] What are you doing? It's not for you.
[37:48] I'm just checking the quality. Very important.
[37:52] Brother Yousuf is right, you shouldn't stop him in the middle of eating...
[37:57] Let me check the quality as well.
Sure.
[38:01] Go ahead... you've been walking a lot haven't you.
[38:05] I'll start walking from today.
We will...
[38:10] We will...
[38:14] Shaggo...
[38:16] The money for the blessing.
I almost forgot.
[38:22] Many congratulations... please distribute it.
[38:31] Brother Yousuf ordered this for you especially.
[38:36] No, thank you. I'm not in the mood.
[38:39] Rimsha... sit with us...
[38:41] Let's plan the baby shower.
[38:44] I'm not well. I want to rest.
