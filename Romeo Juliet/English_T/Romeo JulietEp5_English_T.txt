[01:32] Hello? Yes Shaboo? Did you find blood?
[01:36] Did the hospital tell anything?
No Hamid.
[01:40] Nothing happened here. You people tell me. Whats the update?
[01:46] We are in front of a blood bank. Fariha has gone to ask inside.
[01:50] If we can find blood here then okay otherwise we'll go to the Civil blood bank.
[01:57] Alright.
[01:59] Hamid, hurry up.
[02:02] Brother Yousuf might get critical.
You don't have to worry, Shaboo.
[02:08] God is there. He'll fix everything. Please take care of sister in law.
[02:12] I've stepped out for her.
[02:15] To get something for her to eat. Her blood pressure might drop.
[02:20] Good. Did you tell Zara?
[02:25] I called and informed. They'll come.
[02:28] Alright Shaboo. I'll hang up now. Let me go inside and ask.
[02:33] Fariha is taking very long inside.
[02:37] Listen,
[02:39] do one thing. Ask the hospital staff to find a donor. We're searching too.
[02:46] Alright. I'll talk to someone. May God take care of you.
Bye.
[03:03] Did the doctor tell anything?
Nothing yet.
[03:10] How did they arrange blood?
[03:13] I think the hospital people did it.
[03:22] He is out of danger now. We were able to control the bleeding. He's stable now.
[03:27] And thank God, we were able to find blood on time.
Can we meet him?
[03:31] No. He's resting right now. The nurse will update you.
Thank you doctor.
[03:37] Thank God.
[03:42] I was so scared.
[03:44] Me too.
[03:47] But don't worry. We will not let anything happen to your dad, so easily.
[03:55] We'll always be thankful to that blood donor. Can we find out who he was?
[04:01] We should personally thank him.
[04:05] Saqib, what happened? Whats the situation at the shop?
[04:10] And did you find something in the footage?
[04:12] No. Nothing yet.
[04:16] We'll have proper investigations done, Saqib. And we'll definitely punish whoever is involved.
[04:25] You don't have to worry. I'll fix everything.
[04:36] Should I get water for you?
[04:38] You sit here. Shaboo has gone. She'll bring it.
[04:43] What is it? You seem very happy? Did you win a lottery?
[04:48] Mom, I won a lottery long ago.
[04:50] Now I'll have to cash it.
[04:53] Why are you throwing riddles? Tell me what happened.
[04:58] The fish is about to take the bite. I've played a nice move, lets see where it goes.
[05:04] You never listen to me.
[05:06] I've been telling you, someone has been teaching her. Even when you told her, she's still at her parents' house.
[05:12] Mom, whether someone teaches her anything,
[05:16] I know when to pull her strings. You just wait and watch.
[05:21] What is it? Has she agreed to come back? Are you going to bring her back?
[05:25] Think of it as so. She'll be here with you in this house in a few days.
[05:30] You and your riddles. Where are you going right now?
[05:34] I'm going for dinner with my friends from the bank right now.
[05:37] You know I've been traumatized since so many days but now I'm at peace.
[05:43] You brought this trauma onto yourself.
[05:45] I've been telling you to rid of her.
[05:47] Mom, I'm getting late. We'll talk when I get back. And I said, I'm not letting her go. End of story.
[05:54] Alright. Do whatever you want to do. But tell your wife, don't expect good from me.
[06:01] Alright.
[06:04] Hello?
[06:06] Yes. I'm coming. We have many more problems in life. I'm coming. Okay.
[06:22] Hello mom..
[06:24] How is my child?
I'm fine. How are you?
[06:30] What happened to you?
Nothing happened.
[06:34] I'm going to go rest for a while.
Yes mom. You should.
[06:42] Its amazing. Mom said she wants to go back next week.
Really?
[06:46] Yes.
[06:49] She must be a good doctor.
[06:53] We should also go, Kiran.
[06:56] We have also suffered traumas.
What?
[07:00] Trauma..
Trauma?
[07:04] You're reading books about psychotherapy?
[07:07] No. I read about it in a magazine.
[07:11] They had written a lot about victims of domestic abuse.
[07:15] You should go.
[07:18] Did you read anything about anger management?
[07:21] I did. There were a few things there.
I'm controlling. I'm managing.
[07:26] Otherwise I would have been like Shahzain.
[07:29] Of course. First in the hospital, then in jail.
[07:35] I didn't do anything. I'm controlling.
[07:44] By the way.. will Shahzain agree for the divorce?
[07:51] What difference does it make? You have a right to divorce too.
[07:58] No. I was just thinking he'll not let me go so easily.
[08:05] If you say, I'll go and..
What?
[08:08] Nothing. I was just saying that I might..
[08:15] Don't worry. If he makes a mess, we'll go to a good lawyer.
[08:19] We have options other than violence.
[08:25] Now my sister.. can you get me a good cup of tea?
[08:31] Make it yourself.
[08:36] Everybody is taking advantage of me.
[08:41] I donated blood today.
[08:47] Yes alright. I'll make it myself. Don't ask me for anything now.
[08:55] Excuse me, he's awake and out of danger now.
Thank God.
[09:03] Can we meet him now?
He's calling Fariha again and again.
[09:09] And who is Saqib? He's calling him as well.
This is Saqib.
[09:14] Thank you.
Excuse me.
[09:26] What is the problem?
[09:28] The problem is that you're in the hospital.
[09:35] All of us were so scared, dad.
[09:38] Nothing will happen to your father, dear.
[09:42] Dad.. how are you feeling now?
I'm doing good.
[09:49] My entire family is together, what else do I need?
[09:53] I need my children together. I don't trust life.
[10:04] I've already wasted a lot of time. I don't want to waste any more time.
[10:12] You guys can fight as much as you want and then be done with it please.
[10:24] And whatever little time is left with me, I want to spend with my children and grand children.
[10:36] No dear.. I don't want anything. You can do anything with the shop.
[10:46] It won't make a difference to me. But one thing, can I have my family back?
[11:09] Please stop..
[11:16] I'm sorry.
[11:51] Please get some rest.
[12:03] Hamid uncle, you went through so much trouble. My husband was coming to pick me up.
[12:08] Dear, whats the trouble in it?
[12:11] Your husband has been coming back and forth since morning.
[12:18] I'll go home and offer prayers of gratitude. My brother Yousuf and his family..
[12:25] they are all together now.
[12:28] Thank God aunt. I cannot tell you how happy I am watching this.
[12:34] God brings ease after every difficulty.
[12:38] We should be offering prayers of gratitude for brother Yousuf's health as well.
[12:44] Otherwise we were so scared.
[12:47] How did so much happen? Uncle doesn't have any enmity with anyone.
[12:54] And he is such a patient man.
[12:57] I feel this has more than just enmity to it. But for now..
[13:02] this isn't the right moment to talk about it. I'll take an update myself, later on.
[13:10] This is a worrying situation. If people can do it once, they can do it again.
[13:18] No Shabbo, don't worry.
[13:21] Once we complain in the police, how will someone dare attack him again?
[13:28] But Hamid uncle, you should be careful about everything you do. Such people are very dangerous.
[13:36] Zara dear, we shouldn't bow down to atrocities. You people just pray that Saqib,
[13:46] clears his heart for Fariha.
[13:49] You're right about it.
[13:51] Otherwise, there will be a lot of problems.
By the way, I don't think,
[13:57] Saqib will say anything else. He is already so upset because of uncle.
[14:06] I pray to God for this.
[17:59] Your father..
[18:05] Your father wasn't a bad man.
[18:11] Its just that he would get very angry.
[18:20] Sometimes he would do bad things.
[18:26] He realized everything. His conscience was burdened.
[18:35] Before he died, he apologized to me.
[18:44] I forgave him. You should also forgive him.
[18:56] Those who die are dead.
[19:00] Whoever is left behind, is burdened with their memories.
[19:13] That's why we should just let all grudges go with the dead person.
[19:25] I've seen a lot of pain in my life.
[19:31] I took everybody's burden on my shoulders.
[19:38] I never realized Farhad that I put my own burden on my kids.
[19:50] I did whatever others told me.
[19:57] I spent my life fulfilling expectations.
[20:08] I didn't want my children to live life like this.
[20:17] I want to free my children from the burden of their parents.
[20:27] Life is very colorful. I never allowed,
[20:35] my life could also have been colorful.
[20:40] I surrounded myself with darkness and depression became my identity.
[20:57] I..
[21:06] Whatever you did..
[21:12] I was jealous of you.
[21:18] You wrote your own story.
[21:22] Thats why I couldn't accept it. Whatever you did..
[21:29] Neither Yaqoob nor me.. we didn't have the courage or the sensibility.
[21:47] I don't want you people to surround your lives with my darkness.
[21:53] If one generation is uneducated, the other generation blindly follows it as tradition.
[22:03] You have to break this tradition.
[22:11] I couldn't be a happy mother to you people.
[22:20] It was my mistake but I want to change now. I want to fix my mistakes.
[22:36] Will you be able to forgive your mother?
[22:46] Mom.. I'm very guilty.
[24:04] I want to meet Kiran.
[24:06] She doesn't want to meet you. Go away.
[24:08] Nobody can stop me from meeting my wife. Kiran?
[24:13] Kiran, come outside. Kiran! Lets go home. I'm here to take you back.
[24:25] You said we'd give this marriage another chance. See, I'm here now.
[24:31] Mom.. make her understand. A marriage isn't a joke.
[24:37] I cannot divorce her for such a small thing. We have to nurture relationships.
[24:49] What are you here for?
[24:53] I'm talking to my wife.
[24:57] She doesn't want to talk to you. Get lost.
[25:06] She has decided to come home.
[25:10] Are you out of your mind?
[25:14] If you don't believe me, ask her.
[25:24] You cannot make your marriage work. You must be jealous.
[25:29] Now you want us divorced.
[25:34] And as it is, I cannot compare your disrespectful relationship with my respectful relationship.
[25:50] Shut up, Shahzain. Before I do something.
[25:55] You cannot dare now. Kiran will decide now.
[26:04] Kiran see.. no relationship is perfect. You have to make it perfect.
[26:13] I cannot divorce you for such a small thing.
[26:18] And as it is,
[26:21] this is an unfavorable act in the sight of God.
[26:26] Mom, make her understand. Elders have a duty.
[26:31] If dad was alive, would he want his dear daughter to be divorced?
[26:40] Kiran please.. forgive me.
[26:48] You say something please.
I want to hit you with something.
[26:53] Be cool. This is Kiran's decision.
Yes. The real decision will be Kiran's.
[27:45] Did it hurt? Did it hurt?
[27:54] Its nothing in front of the pain that you gave me, repeatedly. But its alright.
[28:06] Its alright Shahzain. Tell me right now, Kiran, it doesn't make a difference.
[28:13] Its just a slap and it doesn't affect our relationship. I'll come with you right now.
[28:24] But no.
[28:31] Tell me. You're preparing to take your revenge, right?
[28:41] One slap Shahzain..
[28:45] One slap and you're shivering with wrath.
[28:51] Its not the pain that you feel on the outside.. the soul shatters.
[29:05] Are you out of your mind Kiran?
Not at all. I was stupid earlier.
[29:11] I was stupid that I used to believe that whatever happened repeatedly was my fault.
[29:19] Shahzain is upset.. You must have done something Kiran that he had to slap you.
[29:28] He would hit you because its your fault.. you bad luck.. I kept torturing myself telling this.
[29:41] My mind became paralyzed thinking what would people say. Do you know Shahzain?
[29:51] People.. these people.. these are the people who care whether I'm dead or alive.
[30:06] They worry for me. They are my people and they are standing with me.
[30:20] And we'll be here forever.
[30:28] Mom.. can you see? If nothing else..
[30:37] dad's dead soul will be in so much pain that his daughter is a divorcee.
[30:55] I will accept a divorced daughter but not a dead one.
[31:03] Shahzain..
[31:07] After today, not a single scratch will affect the daughter of Yaqoob Kareem Baksh.
[31:16] As soon as she rids of a devil like you.. her father's soul will be at peace.
[31:30] All of you will regret it. All of you... Kiran..
Get lost.
[31:36] Didn't I tell you he was the wrong man?
[31:40] Dear, you should have given him another slap.
[32:07] Should I get something for you?
No dear. I'm fine.
[32:17] Dad, are you feeling better now?
[32:22] Much better dear. Now..
[32:27] Watching my family together, I feel very happy.
[32:33] And, now everything will be alright.
Of course.
[32:41] Thank God that you're alive. Did you find out who did everything?
[32:52] Its strange that nothing was taken from the shop.
[32:56] It seems they were there for something else.
[33:02] Find out who was behind it.
[33:14] You don't have to worry about anything. You just rest.
[33:22] You have to rest inside
[33:23] No. Sit with me. I like it.
[33:40] I knew you'd listen to your family. Fariha is back.
[33:47] See..
[33:49] This isn't the time for all this. Dad came back from the hospital.
[33:54] Dad found the right opportunity to make you listen to him.
[34:03] Its not like that.
Then what is it? 
[34:06] Don't you remember how she insulted us before she left?
[34:09] You all said that the doors of the house were shut for her and she'd never come back 
[34:14] but she just cried and everything was okay.
[34:20] Dad was waiting for his beloved daughter to come back.
[34:24] But you should be ashamed.
[34:26] Do you even know what you're talking about? My dad fought a battle between life and dead.
[34:32] Is this the time to talk?
[34:34] Every time something happens and I have to sacrifice.
[34:42] Tell me.. Will we go to our own house? Will you do this for me and your child?
[34:51] I know, you wouldn't dare. Never. You cannot speak in front of your father.
[34:58] You'll keep hiding in his shadows.
Yes I'll hide in his shadow. 
[35:03] Thats best for me.
[35:11] I cannot decide the right thing. I don't know people, what should I say.
[35:19] Whatever happened with dad was because of me.
[35:24] Because of you?
[35:25] I was after dad's life to sell the shop because I thought this was good for our future. 
[35:31] But I didn't know the man I wanted to sell the shop to, would be like this..
[35:41] They were thieves.
[35:46] Dad said no to selling the shop and he did all this to teach dad a lesson.
[35:57] All my life, 
[36:00] I stayed confined in my community. All relationships, all friendships and every deal I made in my community.
[36:09] I thought our community would support each other
[36:13]  but I didn't know Botalwala would do this to dad..
[36:27] Good and bad people are everywhere 
[36:31] but our community is our community. What is more important than that?
[36:37] One thing is important. 
[36:42] Humanity.
[36:46] You are blaming yourself without a reason. 
[36:49] You didn't know he'd do this. Its not your fault.
[36:56] I made a big mistake. 
[37:02] Its time to fix those mistakes.
[37:07] If I don't do it for myself, I'll do it for my future generations.
[37:16] I'll have to change everything.
[37:56] Mom.. 
[38:01] I know that you must be thinking..
[38:05] what would I do without a husband after my divorce?
[38:12] But mom.. Its best to be alone rather than an abusive relationship.
[38:24] Kiran, whatever you did today..
[38:33] I'm proud of you. 
[38:39] You showed courage.
[38:43] I never thought my daughter was so powerful. 
[38:49] I always taught you whatever I was taught.
[38:54] Husbands are Gods on earth.
[38:57]  We will only leave their house after our death.
[39:02] If a husband hits you when he's angry, you should tolerate because we have to tolerate everything.
[39:12] Hide your husband's fault and don't talk to anyone. Don't imagine living without your husband.
[39:25] I was my parents' only child. If only they had embraced me once,
[39:34] and made me believe that I wasn't a burden on them. Maybe..
[39:44] I would have been courageous to fight for my rights. My story would be different.
[39:54] Nobody opened such a door for me. But I want,
[40:04] that you should decide for your life without any fear.
[40:15] That old tradition is finished with me.
[40:24] Its not that I'm not afraid for your future.
[40:32] But whatever happens, we'll watch it together.
[40:42] I feel ashamed when I look at you.
[40:49] I was never a happy mother. I was always upset.
[41:00] My responsibility was to look after my children's pains.
[41:07] But Kiran, you have looked after me, all my life.
[41:11]  If only you didn't have such a weak mother.
[41:19] Mom.. whatever you did for me today, I'll never forget it all my life.
[41:31] This thought school and old traditions that we revere,
[41:39] its not cowardice to break these chains for your children. Its courage. And my mother..
[41:49] My mother isn't weak.
[41:53]  She's courageous.
[41:58] Everything will be alright. I'll be your strength.
[42:09] Everything will be alright.
