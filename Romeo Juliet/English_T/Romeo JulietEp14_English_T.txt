[00:26] All of us should accept God's will
[00:32] and Farhad, you have to think about the future
[00:38] he was telling me to take care of you guys
[00:44] in fact, he has transferred his catering business on my name
[01:08] Greetings!
[01:09] Greetings! you did very well by coming here
[01:12] how is Farhad?
[01:15] I couldn't talk to him now, uncle (formally)
[01:18] its ok, you'll get to talk to him
[01:20] there is no need to worry, ok?
the situation is as such
[01:23] as it is, let Farhad spend as much time as he wants to with his family. Ok?
[01:29] but you're most welcome here
[01:31] thank you, uncle (formally)
[01:33] but there is a condition for staying here
[01:35] what?
[01:36] yes
[01:38] now you will call me uncle (informally)
[01:42] I mean, why are you calling me uncle (formally)?
you could say uncle (informally), or dear uncle
[01:47] there are so many options though
[01:48] No, I think uncle (informally) is fine
[01:50] Okay uncle! Shall I lock this option?
[01:53] yes
[01:54] total disaster, right?
[01:57] both of you shall sit & talk, meanwhile let me offer the prayers
[02:00] Come, lets sit & talk
and you, please come quickly
[02:03] Ok
[02:10] how are you?
[02:14] I don't know, aunt Shaggo
[02:16] my heart is so heavy
[02:21] neither I could attend the funeral
[02:24] now I could go to offer my condolences
[02:30] Farhad thinks, my presence will make his mother more upset
[02:37] I don't know... 
[02:39] but I am feeling so helpless 
[02:41] I can understand
[02:45] its such a strange time
[02:48] for you.. 
[02:51] and also for Farhad
[02:55] but... 
[02:56] dear, nothing can be done except for showing some patience
[03:04] by the way, tell me something
[03:07] after marriage, have you learnt how to show patience
[03:11] or still your meter stays high?
[03:14] sometimes I get crazy, honestly aunty Shaggo
[03:19] really!
[03:20] I have made your favorite dish Khauswey
[03:24] thank you so much!
you know its been so long that I ate them
[03:29] See then, here they are
Let Hamid come then we'll eat it together
[03:32] Done!
[03:32] I am going to the kitchen, please sit for a while
[03:35] can I help you in something?
No, please keep sitting
[03:53] mom
[03:56] mom, please eat some food
[04:01] mom, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[04:11] please eat
[04:15] its been so many days...
[04:17] look at her
[04:20] dad had passed away
[04:22] and she is also being stubborn, she isn't touching the food
[04:57] please eat some
[05:03] for my sake
[05:11] very nice!
[05:14] I've been asking her since so long, but she wasn't eating anything
[05:17] and upon Farhad's request, she ate immediately
[05:20] by the way, its an open contradiction
[05:26] don't be jealous
[05:30] I am my mother's favorite
[05:44] you will stay with me now, right?
[05:52] I am here, mom
[05:55] I am with you
[05:57] but later, you'll go 
[06:06] mom
[06:10] Fariha is alone over there
[06:15] you are not allowing her to come in this house
[06:20] she is my wife
[06:23] what shall I do?
[06:28] Our cupbearer has been snatched away from us
[06:35] and you are my only son
[06:43] will you turn away your face from your responsibilities?
[06:51] don't you want to live with me?
[06:55] won't you live with me?
[06:56] when am I turning away my face?
[07:01] what is this contumacy?
[07:04] which is never ending
[07:06] will you go after leaving me alone?
[07:11] Can't you live with me?
[07:19] you won't live with me
[07:26] don't cry, please
[07:28] promise me, promise me right away that you'll stay here with me
[07:34] you won't go anywhere
[07:43] I promise you, I won't go anywhere
[07:49] I will stay here with you
[08:01] you guys did very well by coming here
[08:03] the house was so quiet without you guys
[08:08] yes, you did very well by coming here. Now go to the shop as a lot of work is pending there
[08:14] dad, I want to discuss something with you
[08:21] dad, I want to start my own business. I don't want to work with you in your shop
[08:30] kindly give me my share from your business
[08:34] did you hear Rashda, what our son is saying
[08:40] yes, so what wrong thing I am saying?
[08:43] This shop will always remain yours. he never likes any of my idea
[08:49] dad look, I don't want to stay in a small shop in Kharadar (old Karachi area). I want to move ahead
[08:56] Have you gone mad?
the shop of your ancestors which gave you everything
[09:01] due to which you came at this point, so now its not enough for you?
[09:05] so? even grandfather had given the share of inheritance to his children
[09:09] uncle took away his share & did his business, right?
[09:13] I also want my share
[09:15] as it is dad, I cannot tolerate it anymore
[09:23] its better to settle the matter inside our house, instead of visiting the courtrooms
[09:27] are you out of your mind!
[09:30] will you drag your father to the court for your share of inheritance?
Listen to what he is saying!
[09:34] Saqib! What's wrong with you?
[09:39] God forbid that this matter reaches to the courtrooms
[09:42] talk politely, he is your father!
[09:45] make him understand too
[09:47] am I saying something wrong?
[09:50] I brought so many buyers, and good deals. But he doesn't want to sell his shop
[09:54] I don't want to sell my legacy
[09:57] I don't want to sell my share of inheritance, that's it!
[10:01] neither you'll sell the shop, nor you will give me my share of inheritance
[10:05] you just want to keep me in your shop like a servant
[10:07] ok go, I won't give you any share. Do whatever you want to
[10:13] Yousuf, please talk politely
[10:15] tell this to this ill-mannered guy to talk politely!
[10:18] go to your room
[10:21] we'll talk about it later
[10:28] and don't come in front of me to discuss this matter
[10:31] if you want anything then go to the court straight away!
[10:35] he will do case on me!
[10:36] please talk politely
[10:38] why are you saying this to me? Tell him
[11:14] hello Farhad, how are you?
[11:17] Hello Fariha!
[11:19] I am fine
[11:22] Fariha, I am really sorry as I couldn't call you
[11:26] are you fine, is everything fine?
[11:29] yes, everything is fine. Don't take my tension & tell me how are you and how is everyone at home?
[11:36] they are trying to cope up
[11:41] Farhad, can I come over there to meet you & meet everyone at home?
[11:51] No Fariha, it won't be right now
[11:56] mom's condition is not well
[11:59] she needs some time
[12:03] I don't want her to take our her anger on you for no reason, if you come in front of her
[12:10] are you getting my point?
[12:13] of-course! Of-course I understand
[12:17] just take care of you & tell me when will you come back home?
[12:26] Fariha, I have to go as we are having continuous guests at our house. I'll call you later
[12:30] take care, bye!
[12:32] bye!
[13:14] I was so upset with dad
[13:26] I always used to feel that...
[13:30] its better for us to stay away from the house
[13:37] my life won't be affected by his absence
[13:45] we never used to talk to each other properly
[13:54] we always used to fight
[14:02] now..
[14:05] why I am feeling so hurt after his demise, Kiran?
[14:33] I am feeling angry
[14:37] upon myself
[14:40] upon dad
[14:47] we had fought when me met for the last time
[14:51] why he didn't gave me a hug?
[15:00] why did I fight with him?
[15:07] why I didn't reach on time?
[15:21] maybe at that time, we could have cleared out all the misunderstandings from each other
[15:36] "Did you ever regret on loosing your son?"
[15:46] this was my last sentence to him, Kiran
[15:53] and he left us with this regret
[15:58] and now, I will also stay in this regret for life time
[16:01] Farhad
[16:08] Farhad...
[16:15] Farhad, can anyone change the past? tell me
[16:22] yes?
[16:29] the time will slip from our hands like sand
[16:37] have we ever thought of it?
[16:47] did we?
[16:52] compose yourself
[17:01] have you seen mom's condition?
[17:10] you have Fariha's responsibility too
[17:14] yes?
[17:18] yes Farhad?
[17:22] you will solace mom by staying here for sometime
[17:24] what will happen then?
[17:28] think about future
[17:39] dad's...
[17:42] dad's catering business
[17:49] No no Farhad
[17:52] honestly I didn't know that dad is about to do this
[17:58] I didn't had any idea
[18:01] that he will do this before his demise
[18:04] he will put all the responsibilities on me, I cannot sit at his kitchen though
[18:13] Kiran, he didn't had any other option
[18:22] I had clearly refused that I don't have any connection with his catering business
[18:32] Kiran...
[18:36] is everything fine between you & Shahzain?
[18:45] don't know why, I feel as if they have some hopes from us
[18:57] Did he or his family later demand anything as dowry from you?
[19:13] Kiran, tell me if there is any such thing. Let me go & talk to them right away and fix everything
[19:17] No no, not at all
[19:20] not at all
[19:27] actually everyone is amazed, that's it!
[19:34] everyone knew
[19:36] everyone knew that dad wanted his catering business to be expanded further after his demise
[19:41] it shall be continued, and his legacy shall remain intact
[19:49] Who would have thought that before leaving...
[19:53] he will choose me
[19:59] how can I go & sit at his catering business?
[20:06] Farhad
[20:08] you have to take this responsibility
[20:11] you have to handle the catering business now. Yes!
[20:16] Kiran, dad never trusted me
[20:21] he had announced his decision by transferring this catering business to your name
[20:30] and believe me, I have no complaints at all
[20:33] honestly!
[20:41] this is your catering business
[20:44] You can run it however you want
[20:52] I am with you
[21:23] why are you staring!
[21:25] I am the owner of this company
[21:30] and who are you! You don't even worth two bits
[21:33] what is your worth?
[21:51] Greetings Shahzain!
[21:52] Greetings!
[21:54] Do you plan to come back after getting your late father forgiven?
[21:57] what do you mean, I didn't get you?
[22:00] Kiran, if you could understand then you hadn't been in this condition
[22:03] Anyways, do you plan to come back home or you plan to stay there?
[22:07] Shahzain! my father had passed away
[22:12] mom's condition is not well
[22:15] who will handle my house? My mother needs me
[22:18] what do you mean?
your mother is a mother, & my mother is nothing!
[22:22] however she has a daughter-in-law in her house, but still she is standing in the kitchen & doing hard work. Can't you see that?
[22:28] Shahzain, obviously I didn't mean that!
[22:30] whatever you mean, I know it very well
[22:33] come back home immediately, enough of your mourning & drama
[22:38] Can't you hear, what I am saying?
[22:39] I am listening!
[22:43] immediately come back home
[22:46] hmm...
[22:48] Okay
[22:50] I will talk to Farhad first, make some arrangements. Then I will come
[22:54] one second!
[22:55] who is this Farhad?
[22:57] you are my wife, so you will do whatever I will ask you to do. Right?
[23:01] I said come back home, so come! That's it
[23:24] Ramsha, what are you doing? At least listen to me
[23:27] I always say that your words have no importance
[23:30] how many times I had told you that you cannot get this matter settled so easily!
[23:33] so what shall I do?
Shall I drag my father to the court?
[23:36] problems do get solved by talking
[23:38] as if you will talk! And the problems will be solved after discussion
[23:42] I have told you to give me some time. I will fix everything
[23:46] nothing will be fixed, Saqib
[23:48] I can see my own dreams getting shattered
[23:51] why are you saying this?
[23:53] they are not only your dreams, but mine too
[23:56] I will fulfill them by any means
[23:59] and you keep solacing me in this manner
[24:01] later I feel so embarrassed
[24:04] I am not solacing you. I promise you
[24:07] God promise
[24:08] I don't want to hear your promises
[24:10] I am telling you, I won't let my children future gets destroyed
[24:14] who will let them sacrifice? Aren't they my kids too?
[24:17] I promise you. God promise!
[24:24] Ramsha, your anger... I swear upon God, I get so afraid
[24:30] smile now
[24:32] I have done God promise to you
[24:37] aunt, you could have told me so that I could have helped you
[24:41] no no, everything is done. Come sit
[24:52] what are you looking at?
[24:57] before today, I have never seen you so happy
[25:01] is uncle Hamid so good?
[25:09] honestly speaking Fariha
[25:12] I had stopped thinking about this phase of my life
[25:20] I will get someone so loving & caring in this age
[25:26] I had never thought of it
[25:28] Honestly Hamid is such a good person
[25:31] what's the connection of love with age?
[25:35] we just impose such restrictions on ourselves for no reason
[25:40] you are right, Fariha
[25:42] I have learnt from you, how to live my life freely
[25:48] I pray that the doors of my parents heart also gets open for me
[25:53] Surprise!
[25:57] Zara! Billu... how come they are here?
[26:01] what were you thinking, that you will eat the khowsuey prepared by aunt all alone?
[26:05] we will never let that happen
[26:07] Zara had called me
[26:08] when I told her that you are here, so both of them came running
[26:12] hungry kids!
[26:15] Well... Fariha, tell me something
[26:19] why didn't you tell us about Farhad's father's death?
[26:23] actually...
[26:26] I was already surrounded by so many problems and...
[26:30] then you guys had to lie at home because of me
[26:35] that's why I didn't tell
[26:36] hey! I am expert in this, as you know
[26:38] and yes, I am training her too. It will take some time, but she'll come on our level soon
[26:42] shameless! What non-sense you are uttering
[26:44] Quickly sit, the lunch is piping hot. Let me call Hamid
[26:48] Come on, quickly sit
[27:10] uncle
[27:12] yes dear?
[27:14] uncle, I am going back to my house today
[27:16] Okay dear
[27:18] and I want to discuss something important with you before leaving
[27:23] yes, tell me
[27:27] actually its about the catering business
[27:32] uncle, you know Farhad. He clearly refused that he won't sit there
[27:36] he has clearly refused
[27:38] Kindly handle & look after the things for a few days with Jojo
[27:42] don't worry, together we'll take care of it
[27:46] but... this catering business is in your fate
[27:52] I am in a strange dilemma
[27:57] I don't understand anything
[28:00] for my entire life dad gave me this lesson
[28:05] that a girl's real fate is her husband's house
[28:10] and an outside world
[28:13] is men property
[28:16] and see, he granted me everything while leaving
[28:22] why, what does it mean?
[28:24] he might have experienced a miracle before his death
[28:27] that's why his brain came to its right place
[28:33] otherwise, his thinking was so old school in his entire life
[28:37] Kiran, this catering business is your property
[28:42] what your father wanted, nobody knows that more than you
[28:48] if he had a heart's connection with someone
[28:51] then dear, it was with you
[28:54] you will understand what to do on the right time
[28:58] now relax & go home. Ok dear? Go now
[29:41] what are you doing?
[29:47] I came to get mom's blood pressure medicine
[29:51] what is all this, Jojo?
[29:56] don't know which medicines she keep taking
[29:59] I hid quite a lot of them
[30:03] for what she takes the medicines?
[30:07] a few are of anxiousness, some are sleeping pills
[30:09] they are so many
[30:14] but Jojo, mom doesn't visit any doctor. Then from where these medicines come?
[30:22] she takes suggestion from every other person, & then bring that medicines at home
[30:27] the aunt from the neighbors visits us usually
[30:30] sometimes she tell her to try this medicine, or to try that medicine
[30:33] and its getting too much, since you've gone
[30:37] I try to stop her from my side but...
[30:41] how much I can stop her
[30:48] why didn't you tell me this earlier?
[30:50] what would have happened, Farad? As you weren't here
[30:54] She used to listen to you until you were here. 
She never listens to anyone except for you
[31:00] She takes all the medicines whenever she gets a panic attack
[31:05] Ask me, how I handle her
[31:08] I don't understand how to react. I try to chill her, or calm her down
[31:18] I will talk to mom once she feels better
[31:24] Jojo look...
[31:26] let me come back to this house
[31:29] Fariha... my wife has to come back with me
[31:33] are you getting my point?
[31:37] Look, if I took Fariha name in front of mom then she'll get worried
[31:43] what to do!
[31:48] she will be fine
[31:50] it will take some time, but she will be fine
[31:54] handle both the places for now, & leave the tension of this house on me
[31:58] I will see
[32:18] are you back after mourning upon your father's death?
[32:21] by the way, he was such a clever man
[32:24] what did he think?
[32:26] everything will change by doing all this?
[32:29] and I am sure
[32:30] you must have said something due to which that old hag changed!
[32:35] Shahzain
[32:37] believe me, I haven't said anything to anyone
[32:42] nothing is going to change by saying!
[32:44] this catering business will be sold out
Shahzain!
[32:49] listen to me very carefully
[32:52] this catering business in my father's last memorial
[32:56] its his entire life's hard work. I won't let it get sold
[32:59] he came to you, because he trusted you
[33:01] Oh... so you want me to sit at that worthless catering business & serve rice & curry to the people. Right?
[33:10] in fact no! Lets do one thing
[33:13] He had transferred it on your name, right?
So my wife will sit there
[33:17] she will serve rice & curry to the people over there
[33:20] my wife doesn't work inside the kitchen, yet she'll run the catering business
[33:23] Shahzain!
[33:25] listen to me very carefully
[33:28] He trusted me, I won't let this catering business get sold
[33:33] just because you've got the property so you've got a long tongue now
[33:38] but I have to teach you a lesson
[33:42] I have to teach you a lesson...
Shahzain
[33:44] what Shahzain?
Speak up!
[33:48] speak up
[34:00] hello Farhad!
[34:01] Hello Fariha, where are you?
[34:05] I came home
[34:06] Farhad, I was alone at home so I came to aunt Shaggo's house
[34:12] aunt Shaggo?
[34:17] Fariha, I came here to see you after leaving behind a lot of my work. I was tensed that you are all alone here
[34:22] and you are at your aunt's place!
[34:25] at least, you could have informed me before going
[34:27] Farhad, I didn't wanted to disturb you
[34:30] I thought, you'll call me once before coming. I am coming right away
[34:35] its not about disturbing. At least, you could have sent a text
[34:40] right now I have to go to the hospital to get the death certificate
[34:43] Also, I had to visit my dad's grave for the name plate. I have many other works to do, but I came here for you
[34:48] Farhad, let me come now. Let me come immediately
[34:54] Its ok, Fariha
[34:57] we'll talk later
[34:58] Farhad please...
[35:34] hello! yes Irfan, all ok?
[35:36] Sorry to disturb you at this time, but there is some tension
[35:42] what happened, all good?
[35:46] boss is angry with you
[35:48] why?
[35:50] didn't you tell him that my father had passed away?
[35:53] I had told him, but he is saying that how can Farhad took an off without applying for the leave
[36:00] oh man...
[36:03] alright, let me send an online application right away
[36:06] don't do this mistake, boss will become more furious
[36:09] do one thing, come to office talk to boss. Submit the application form & leave
[36:15] I know its an ordinary formality but..
[36:19] boss is making this an issue
[36:21] are you getting my point?
[36:23] yes, alright. I am coming in a while
[36:27] if you want to save your job, then come right away
[36:31] otherwise, boss is waiting that somehow he gets a chance to do something against you
[36:41] are you listening?
[36:42] Okay, I am coming
[36:45] I will come after changing
[37:05] sorry to hear about your father
[37:10] are you fine now?
[37:15] anyways, I had made this for you
[37:19] just submit it quickly & leave
[37:27] hey thank you Mr. Farhad
[37:31] thank you so much for coming to the office
[37:34] you have done a favor on our company by applying for the leaves
[37:40] Sir, actually my father had passed away that's why I couldn't apply for the leave. But let me do it right away
[37:47] what do you think of yourself?
[37:49] if anyone's death happens in the family, then one needs to take a day off by submitting the leaves form
[37:54] and have to inform the management
[37:58] and are you above the rules?
[38:00] or was your father some unique person!
[38:25] why are you staring now?
[38:27] why are you staring!
[38:30] I am the owner of this company
[38:34] and who are you! You don't even worth two bits
[38:38] what is your worth?
[38:48] this is my worth!
