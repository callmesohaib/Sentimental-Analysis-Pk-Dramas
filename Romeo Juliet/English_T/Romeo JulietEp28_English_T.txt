[00:17] break her contact from the outside world
[00:19]  this phone is the bone of contention!
[00:22] we'll make the decision tomorrow & that too in front of everyone
[00:25]  you will get married to the person & family of our choice
[00:29] dad... 
[00:30] I am not asking from you, but telling you
[00:34] that I have fixed your marriage with Sameer, brother Zaman's son
[00:40] but dad... 
Enough! leave...
[00:46] thank you, thank you!... 
[01:08] are you happy now?
[01:10] are you satisfied!
[01:12] what have I done, sister?
[01:14] its you who have brain washed her, right?
 these lessons of love or so
[01:18] sister, I didn't had any such discussion with Freeha
[01:22] you want my daughter to stay unmarried like you, right?
[01:29] why will I want this, sister?
[01:32] I was trying to explain Freeha that all this love or so..
stop it!
[01:38] there is no need to explain her anything
[01:43] He had never listened to anything about his sister, but now the matter has come to our daughter
[01:49] I was afraid of this thing, that you will be a bad influence on our daughters
[01:55] it feels as if the history is repeating itself
[02:00] for God sake, stay away from my daughter
[02:05] there is no need to explain her anything!
[02:08] we have already borne too much because of you
[02:11] we cannot tolerate it anymore
[02:23] what happened to mom?
[02:25] she had uttered such bitter words
[02:29] what's your fault in it?
[02:31] Freeha is so stubborn & selfish
[02:33] No, sister's mood wasn't good
[02:36] everything is fine
[02:56] I can't believe that we have convinced our families
[02:59] hmm... but Farhad look, no matter what happens tomorrow
[03:03] don't say anything wrong
[03:06] nothing can be wrong tomorrow, because we have only one chance to win everyone's heart
[03:10] why will I say anything inappropriate?
[03:12] in fact, you shall be careful
[03:15] what if you got mad & slapped someone
[03:18] what's wrong? I am not that crazy to slap anyone just like that
[03:22] yes, true that. One should have a solid reason to slap someone
[03:27] yes, so what else?
[03:28] Ok repeat after me, "its wrong to do violence"
[03:32] be quiet, don't talk rubbish
[03:37] talk to your to-be husband with respect
[03:40] I can't believe, listen... 
[03:43] I am going to offer prayers right away, that nothing shall be wrong now
[03:50] Ok? I will talk to you later
[03:52] as I have to offer prayers for us
[03:54] even I am starting tomorrow's preparations right away
[03:57] Okay... bye!

[05:03] it doesn't make any difference, I will wear Shalwar Kameez. Don't worry

[11:33] I get to know prior that what's in a person's heart & what are his intentions
[11:37] I got to know it at that time, when I had met that vile man
[11:42] I am amazed that you cannot recognize people at all!
[11:45] how dare you to invite that man to my house?
[11:48] dad, there might be a misunderstanding. At least, try talking to them once
[11:51] there is no misunderstanding. I have met him, your contumacy is fulfilled
[11:57] be thankful that I met him on the right time & you haven't got into this quick sand
[12:01] enough of your choice & decisions. 
Now this chapter is closed, that's it!

[12:50] let me push the car, wait
[13:22] dad
[13:28] explain her, tell her
[13:32] don't know what story she has kept in her mind
[13:35] you liked a guy in your college, right?
tell her
[13:39] so what you did?
[13:40] she came to inform me before taking any step
[13:45] she told me the truth, and I honored her choice
[13:51] she gave me respect then only those people came here for the proposal
[13:56] it wasn't any ordinary family, it was a good family
[14:01] but the guy was a fraudster
[14:03] and that's why she had brought them to me while considering them a good family
[14:10] tell her, whatever she is thinking is never going to happen
[14:16] I won't let it happen! She shall keep sitting here
[14:19] dad... 
[14:33] lets go, Shaggo
[14:36] leave her on her own
[14:39] she has written these tears herself in her fate
[14:43] don't know what as such mistake we did
[14:46] that she is adamant to ruin the honor & respect of our family
[14:53] have mercy on us!
[14:59] lets go!
mom.. 
[15:05] aunty... 
[15:46] Yaqoob
[15:56] I hardly speak to such people
[15:58] it was my bad luck that I had met him
[16:04] think before your speak!
don't you know where you are standing?
[16:44] nobody has ever dared to talk to me in that manner
[16:48] what have we earned until date?
only respect
[16:52] and it got ruined in just a few minutes, only because of you
[17:03] that man was pushing me, insulting me. And he, your dearest son was requesting him
[17:11] didn't you feel ashamed?
[17:14] You couldn't tolerate it, right?
[17:18] you couldn't see my happiness?
[17:22] what as such the matter was, that you couldn't sit there for a few minutes & talk to them?
[17:25] what as such the matter was, that you couldn't hold your anger for a few seconds?
[17:28] stop your rubbish!
[17:36] that man was pushing me, insulting me... and I shall bow down in front of him?
[17:40] I shall beg him in his feet like a dog?
[17:42] because I am an ordinary person & he is a very rich guy!
[17:49] when I met him the very first time, he was showing me off with his car
[17:54] after that, I had gone to buy Kiran's jewelry. So he said to me.. 
[17:58] that you don't have a stature to enter my shop
[18:00] and he our dearest son is thinking that he'll make him his son-in-law
[18:04] are you out of your mind? Open your eyes
[18:08] they are those people, who even keeps a dog after checking its race
[18:12] what is your worth though?
[18:14] we belong to Khursheed Khan's family
[18:19] he was a Rajput
[18:21] yes, and we are proud of our family
[18:25] but they think that we are an ordinary caterers
[18:30] what to say to them, brother?
[18:33] they feel ashamed on themselves, while calling them caterers
[18:37] he has gone blind after seeing the glitters of gold
[18:40] yes! we are middle class people, and her family is hi-fi... 
[18:45] but neither I saw her palace, nor she saw my kitchen
[18:48] these things doesn't matter to us
[18:50] yes dear, as if you live on the moon. Why will these things matter to you?
[18:55] this is world & you live here
[18:58] and there are differences in this world
[19:05] my dear, love is an emotion
[19:10] but when the reality of life is added to it
[19:16] then one needs to take many bitter sips
[19:20] then we get to know the reality of life
[19:30] life is not spent upon the basis of love
[19:35] and my life doesn't function without Freeha
[19:39] if I will break your legs then you won't be able to walk without her
[19:44] listen to me
[19:46] this marriage cannot happen
[19:49] end the matter, go to your room
[19:51] shed tears, cry for as much time as you want to. Go on hunger stike, got it?
[19:56] and when this romeo phase is over, then come back to your stature
[20:00] I can only see one reality of my life & that is Freeha!
[20:07] and I will ensure to make her a part of my life, dad
[20:13] then listen to me
[20:16] no girl will come to this house from that family
[20:18] Fine!
[20:20] I will leave this house
[20:24] No dear, what are you saying?
[20:26] Fine
[20:28] you can fulfill this desire too
[20:30] get out!
[20:33] you'll get to know the reality once you'll spend the night under the sky for a few days. You won't be able to earn for some food
[20:44] I am your also your son 
[20:47] I will show you
[20:56] stop him
[20:59] Farhad... 
[21:12] go away... 
[21:15] you are leaving your parents for your love story
[21:19] you'll see the consequences of it
[21:29] Yaqoob, is our only son
[21:31] quiet!
[21:39] he is dead for me
[21:42] I don't have any son or so
[22:34] what are you saying, Jojo? 
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
[22:37] I didn't get a chance to tell you anything
[22:39] where is Farhad?
[22:42] right now, He is with me at the gym
[22:44] what this crazy guy has done
[22:47] ok listen to me
[22:48] listen to me with patience, let me come & try to explain dad. Ok?
[22:52] Relax, and keep Farhad relaxed too. I am coming, I will call you back in a while
[22:56] Ok?
yes
[22:57] okay
[22:59] what Farhad did now?
[23:03] he left the house
[23:05] just now his proposal related matters were being discussed, then how come all of this had happened?
[23:07] I know nothing, Shahzain, I think there had been some issue at the girl's house
[23:11] I think your brother must have done some drama, he is such a big looser!
[23:15] he can never do anything in his life
[23:16] Zain!
and listen to me very carefully
[23:19] you won't go to meet him at all
[23:21] what Shahzain, but... 
no ifs or buts
[23:23] didn't you hear what I had said?
 You will not go to meet him
[23:26] don't know in what things he'll get into after going out of the house
[23:29] and his spectacle shouldn't come to my house
[23:34] as far as meeting your parents is concerned, I will personally go
[23:40] I feel pity on your parents
[24:11] eat something
[24:13] I've brought your favorite, egg burger
[24:17] I am not hungry
[24:25] oh man...
[24:28] even our bad luck is way too bad
[24:30] everything was going so smooth & well, but all of a sudden everything got upside down
[24:45] that's why I am scared of happiness
[24:51] do you know, Jojo
[24:53] for the first time in my life I felt so happy
[24:59] I felt as if I am seeing some dream
[25:05] and then all of a sudden I woke up
[25:10] the life has thrown me back to reality
[25:15] by the way, you shouldn't have said that you are leaving the house
[25:20] so, did they stop me?
[25:22] they already wanted to oust me from the house
[25:25] and now they've got a chance
[25:27] are you mad?
 its not like that, they say it out in anger
[25:31] and I've become fed-up of listening to his taunts, Jojo
[25:37] you'll see
[25:40] now I will go back in front of them after becoming a big man
[25:43] means, you won't go back to your house until then? 
You won't meet your parents?
[25:50] your mind also gets empty when your stomach is empty
[25:54] eat something first, come on
[25:57] eat...
I don't want to eat
[25:59] wait for a few days, let the matter cool down a bit then we'll talk again
[26:04] come on eat
[26:06] hold it
[26:09] eat
[26:11] come on
[26:17] Ok, let me go & make an arrangement for you to stay here
[26:22] hey listen!
[26:24] why are you bothering yourself for me?
[26:27] go home
[26:29] really? Do you think, I can go home after leaving you alone over here?
[26:36] stay here
[27:08] a lot had happened, and you didn't even tell me
[27:14] what I could have told you? You have recently got married
[27:18] its just that I didn't wanted to bother you
[27:22] leave this discussion. You just came now, & see what we are discussing
[27:26] how are you?
Are you happy?
[27:30] that's good
[27:31] they are coming tomorrow for your engagement
[27:34] and I got to know that Sameer is a nice guy, also his family is really good
[27:40] don't close your mind on him
[27:44] Zara, when my heart is already closed then how will my mind support it?
[27:49] that's your problem, Freeha
you always think with your heart
[27:53] and its better for the girls like us not to do such mistakes
[27:57] we were told only one thing since our childhood
[27:59] that we have to get married to a Memon guy & as per our family's choice
[28:03] look at me, I didn't allowed my heart to misled to some other direction
[28:11] I wish, I could also control my heart in the same manner but...
[28:15] maybe, I am not born to be like that
[28:20] try to forget him
[28:23] as there is betterment for you & this family in it
[28:26] otherwise, it will become way too difficult for you to spend your life Freeha
[28:31] its already like that
[28:40] what stupidity Farhad did!
[28:43] he is your only son
[28:45] and he should become your right hand, instead he is adding worries to your life
[28:49] we have become fed-up of him
[28:53] he doesn't even care a bit that my parents are old now, I should take care of them a bit
[28:57] or I shall realize about them
[28:58] dad, he is quite emotional
[29:01] and furious too, you'll see that he'll come back from the same door while apologizing within a few days
[29:05] what's this?
[29:06] means, he does one mistake after another & then apologizes
[29:10] some mistakes cannot be forgiven
[29:13] and dad, do you remember. Kiran & my marriage was on the verge of breaking because of him
[29:18] he doesn't care about anything at all!
[29:21] we cannot keep any sort of hope with such kind of a person
[29:23] dad, I will talk to him. I will try to explain him, he will understand
[29:29] what will you explain him?
[29:30] will you teach him how to respect his father in this age?
[29:34] that father who did so many sacrifices for him, what not he did for his son?
[29:38] and he left after turning away his face from his parents
[29:41] we cannot teach anything to such a person
[29:44] He will understand. Shahzain, he will
[29:46] leave it mom, I know it very well
[29:49] Farhad is one selfish & ungrateful person!
[29:53] and I know it very well that in what company he is sitting in nowadays!
[29:56] and now he is into filmy romance. What kind of a hope you'll have from such a person?
[30:04] dad... you don't need to worry
[30:08] if you ever need anything, please let know without any hesitation
[30:12] if you want any help in the kitchen, then I will come after my job
[30:15] but don't consider yourself alone, I am also like your son
[30:20] your words are enough for me, dear
[30:24] thanks to God I am satisfied that at least my daughter is happily married in her house
[31:46] what do you think, what kind of a father I am?
[31:51] you are the best, dad
[31:53] very nice
[31:57] have I ever asked you for anything?
[32:06] I have always thought that...
[32:09] its better to give as much as you can to your children
[32:14] whether its education, manners, love, honor... family values
[32:20] give them so much that if tomorrow
[32:24] its needed, then my upbringing shall bring it to me without asking
[32:42] but my thinking was wrong
[32:49] that's why today I have come to ask you for something
[32:58] see...
[33:00] they are coming tomorrow to do the engagement ritual
[33:09] if you love your father even a bit
[33:13] and you honor my respect a bit
[33:17] then don't do any drama
[33:25] I beg you...
please dad please..
[33:29] please
[35:29] how are you?
[35:31] I am fine, how about you?
[35:33] all good
[35:34] actually I wanted to return your slippers, the one you gave me on that day
[35:39] I took them from someone else to gave you
[35:43] had you given me someone else's slippers?
[35:44] No no, I had washed & cleaned them first before giving it to you
[35:48] Okay, thank you!
[35:50] You're welcome!
thank you so much.
[35:52] please sit
[35:56] So...
[35:59] Its your niece's engagement
[36:01] how do you know?
[36:07] Instagram, twitter, Facebook...
[36:10] they are nothing in front of our Memom Hot line
[36:13] the way aunt Zubeda spreads the news of our community, even a good news channel cannot do it
[36:19] do you know that?
[36:21] what does she say about Freeha?
[36:23] No... nothing!
[36:30] and what does it say about me?
[36:32] the Memon hot line
[36:38] Shaggo
[36:40] does it really matter to you?
[36:44] I hardly care about what people say
[36:47] I am habitual of making my own point of view
[36:51] now tell me one thing
[36:55] whatever happened with you
[36:58] who else can know about it better than you?
[37:03] whatever a person goes through
[37:07] only he can understand its pain
[37:11] I got to know about your wife
[37:15] I'm so sorry about it, but when she died?
[37:20] its been so many years
[37:23] Hamid, few wounds never recover
[37:28] they leave their impact
[37:32] and we have to become habitual of tolerating its pain
[37:45] what do you keep writing in your diary? 
Poetry?
[37:48] poetry!
[37:50] as if you haven't read it
[37:52] its your personal thing, and who am I to check it
[37:55] really?
[37:57] I am not friends with words
[38:00] but I am friends with numbers
[38:02] really?
yes
[38:03] brother Yousuf have always taught me how to become a financially independent woman
[38:08] and I've always hold on to that lesson
[38:12] whenever I get some money, I keep investing. 
Sometimes in stock exchange...
[38:17] sometimes in mutual funds or gold
[38:20] its such a good thing
yes
[38:23] then I should be taking financial advice from you
[38:26] you will get the financial advice, but I will charge its fee
[38:35] thank God that dad's eyes got opened itself
[38:38] otherwise, I had decided
[38:40] if this matter will go on, then I will say it clearly that I cannot keep my relation with such people
[38:44] its good that the matter got stalled outside
[38:50] and there is no need to prolong this engagement time period as well
[38:53] quickly get her married so that she shouldn't do any new drama
[38:56] yes... even dad was saying the same thing now
[38:59] you shall also think about the future
[39:02] make arrangements of this shop & get your share
[39:06] although you are also a business partner in it, but still dad controls everything
[39:12] he just deposits the money in our account on monthly basis
[39:14] do you know, my brother has bought a 1000 sq. yards house in Defence
[39:19] my mom & dad says, its a good thing if the children are becoming independent
[39:23] and until when we'll stay stuck in this area?
[39:26] even I don't want to live here
[39:28] but my dad & others don't want to move out, what shall I do?
[39:31] then they shall live here
[39:33] in the future, we have to start our own family. We have to think about them
[39:37] I will talk to dad once Freeha gets married
[39:40] everyone will be happy after getting their share of inheritance
[39:43] I have chosen the place as well, I want to move to phase 8
[39:46] if you will see my brother's house there, you'll be amazed. Its way too amazing!
[39:59] did you see? How he used to spoil Freeha at all times
[40:02] my Freeha this, my Freeha that...
[40:05] He made us go crazy. 
Also he had spoiled her way too much
[40:09] and now he has fallen on his face
[40:13] brother had got a very big shock
[40:16] what a big shock?
First his sister did, and now his daughter did
[40:20] and we kept explaining, but he never listens to us
[40:25] Thank God my Zara is not that kind of a girl, nor she got influenced by any such women
[40:30] All praise to God, our daughter is so pious & obedient
[40:36] we also have a daughter, don't say such things
[40:40] may God never test anyone with such a trial
[40:44] Does she stop? Or wait to humiliate us at any point?
[40:48] I will speak now
[40:52] anyways leave it
[40:53] at least talk to brother, as soon as Freeha's matter gets fixed
[40:58] he shall set-up a business for you, so that we shall leave something behind for Billu
[41:04] how can I talk to him in this situation?
[41:06] this is the best chance, try to understand my point
[41:12] make him realize that you are with him
[41:15] now see, Saqib is adamant to sell the shop. And his daughter is not in her senses
[41:21] I must say, this is the best chance
[41:23] make him realize, how sincere you are to him
[41:27] I am so sure that he won't refuse at all
[41:33] you don't need to be afraid of him
[41:36] I am not afraid of him, but I respect him
[41:40] whatever, just get our work done.
