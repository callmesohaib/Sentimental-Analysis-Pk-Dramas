[00:13] Thank you for showing so much concern for us.
[00:18] Where is that idiot right now?
[00:20] He is a hard working boy so he must be at restaurant.
[00:23] Sir, you have eaten meal so you will have to pay the bill.
[00:32] Can't you please behave maturely?
[00:35] Yes, what they say, immature people. Come and say in my ear.
[00:42] You are really very immature. That's it.
[00:45] Do you have any idea, what are you saying?
[01:00] Saqib, we are very angry with you.
[01:03] Ramsha got so sick but you didn't even inform us.
[01:08] Well.
[01:08] We are not strangers, we are you loved ones
[01:12] and loved ones support each other in such difficult times.
[01:15] Sister, that was not serious. I felt dizzy because of weakness. I am fine.
[01:20] Yes, this happen in this situation so you should take care of yourself.
[01:25] You can stay here if you want to.
[01:29] No sister, that won't be needed. I am perfectly fine.
[01:33] Saqib, Mr. Nazeer told me that he has got two plots for sale.
OK.
[01:40] That would be good deal.
[01:42] What do you say about that?
[01:44] Did you talk to dad?
[01:45] I have talked to dad but he needs some time.
[01:52] As you know that we need some time to make such big decisions. We can't make such decision in a hurry.
[01:59] That's good, you shouldn't be hasty but
[02:04] Don't sit quietly for too long lest you will miss this golden opportunity.
[02:10] Look
[02:11] I am worried about future of you and Ramsha because you are like a brother to me.
[02:18] Brother, I will try that we decide as soon as possible.
[02:24] Why are you discussing this issue?
[02:26] Leave it Saqib and taste these meat balls.
[02:28] I was just saying. Pass that dish.
OK.
[02:31] The food is very delicious.
[02:37] I have given medicine.
[02:41] I have given pain killer with milk. I am hopeful
[02:46] She will be alright by tomorrow.
God willing.
[02:51] I don't know what happened to my innocent daughter.
[02:55] I can't see her in this condition.
[02:59] We will know in the morning that what happened to her. She is sleeping now.
[03:06] OK, we must leave now and we will take her in the morning.
[03:11] Can I say something?
[03:14] I think we should leave Fareeha with Shaggo for some time.
[03:21] What kind of mother she is, who couldn't see her wounds bleeding.
[03:26] No one can understand a daughter's sorrow more than a mother.
[03:31] But
[03:32] You know Saqib very well.
[03:36] I don't know what is going on in his mind.
[03:40] If he will see Fareeha in this condition with us then
[03:44] Matter can become worse.
[03:45] But what will Fareeha say that her dad didn't take her with him despite seeing her in that condition.
[03:54] Brother, sister is right.
[03:59] Let Fareeha stay with us for few days.
[04:06] You should resolve your issues first.
[04:10] I think we should leave Fareeha here.
[04:15] It would be better if she will stay with Shaggo for few days.
[04:19] And we will get sufficient time to make Saqib understand.
[04:24] We will have to act according to the situation.
[04:31] Brother Yousuf.
[04:34] We also have some obligation to take care of Fareeha.
[04:38] Let us do something for her.
[04:41] And you don't have to worry. Everything will be alright.
[04:45] God willing.
[04:47] I want to see my daughter.
She is sleeping now.
[04:53] She can get disturbed if you will go there.
[04:58] May God have mercy. Let's go home.
[05:02] We will come in the morning. OK my child.
[05:07] Make brother understand.
My child.
[05:12] My child.
[05:18] Aunt, there is a stall of egg burger in back lane. Do I bring that?
[05:25] After that you will have to take your medicine.
[05:29] I am not feeling hungry.
[05:33] Aunt, eat something. You didn't take your medicine during day.
[05:36] How can I eat anything?
[05:40] Farhad hasn't come.
[05:43] Farhad will come back. You should eat food and take your medicine.
[05:48] Don't divert my thoughts like children.
[05:52] He won't come home today as well.
[05:58] Aunt, he is very busy. He is solely managing whole restaurant.
[06:08] And who will take care of me?
[06:13] Won't he take care of me?
[06:18] He takes care of you.
[06:20] But
[06:25] Do you have phone? Call him.
[06:30] OK, let me call him.
[06:34] Don't worry.
[06:41] Let me talk to him.
[06:50] I think signals are weak.
[06:54] Leave it.
[06:57] He is at his wife's house and she doesn't want him to meet his mother.
[07:05] Aunt
[07:07] Sister Fareeha is not that bad she is a very nice girl. Please give her a chance.
[07:15] OK, bring her here then I will leave this house.
[07:21] I didn't mean that.
[07:23] I should have died with Yaqoob.
[07:31] Convey my message to Farhad
[07:35] Live with her wife and don't attend my funeral. OK.
[07:44] Don't follow me.
[08:08] Hey, how did you come in?
[08:11] did Fareeha come home?
No.
[08:13] Go
[08:15] Give me her address.
Stop
[08:18] Listen to me.
[08:21] Sir
[08:24] What are you doing here and how dare you to beat my daughter?
[08:29] I didn't beat her. That was a mistake.
[08:31] You won't repeat that mistake again because she won't go to your house again.
[08:36] Please let me meet her once.
[08:38] Get lost from here and go away. Ask him to leave.
[08:43] Sir please try to understand.
[08:44] No one will understand your words. Get him out of here.
[08:47] What is he doing here?
[08:49] How dare you to come in?
Saqib let's go inside and talk.
[08:53] Please let me meet Fareeha once.
[08:56] What does he mean.
I will tell you. Let's go inside.
[08:59] What does he mean? Where is Fareeha?
[09:02] Let's go inside.
[09:04] Why don't you leave? Go.
Go from here. Just get lost.
[09:07] Get out. Close the gate.
Take him in.
[09:16] What does she want now?
[09:17] This is the outcome of such marriages.
[09:21] But we can't ignore her in this condition.
[09:25] And what about her ignorance?
[09:27] Have you forgotten that?
[09:29] She is an expert to get your sympathies.
[09:34] But she is so upset and injured so what would we do
[09:38] And she is with Shaggo at the moment.
Let her stay there.
[09:42] Now let's see how long will she keep her marriage in tact. She should stay there.
[09:46] Saqib, what are you talking about? Are you son of this family or not?
[09:50] If you are my son then she is daughter of mine.
Listen dad.
[09:54] She has already lost this status
[09:56] and you said that the doors of this house are closed for her.
[10:00] At least you should remember your words.
Yes, I said that.
[10:05] But
[10:06] I was unable to see her in that condition today.
[10:10] This is your weakness and she utilizes that.
[10:15] She is responsible for all of this. What can we do.
[10:18] But how long will she live at Shaggo's house?
It's upto her.
[10:22] She is not our responsibility now.
[10:24] And I am telling you that you should tell her that it would be better for her if she may not come in front of me.
[10:33] Has he lost his mind?
[10:41] You should advise him.
[10:46] What's wrong with you? Why are you so angry?
[10:49] Why have you become enemy of yourself?
[10:54] I didn't want to hurt her.
[10:58] Everything happened so suddenly that I couldn't control myself.
[11:01] You know that I can't hurt her.
[11:05] You insist aunt to go to doctor. I think you should go to doctor first.
[11:10] And get treatment of your brain.
[11:22] Listen my friend, this is not right.
[11:25] No matter if this is a mistake or whatever but this is not right.
[12:32] Shaggo
Hmm.
[12:33] Hasn't Fareeha woken up yet?
[12:35] I was about to wake her up after making her favorite breakfast.
[12:40] She will wake up.
Greetings.
[12:44] How are you feeling now?
I am fine.
[12:46] Isn't there any pain in your wound?
No.
[12:50] I have made your favorite breakfast.
Aunt
[12:54] Farhad sent me so many messages and called me as well.
[12:59] He was feeling very guilty.
[13:02] I think I have over reacted and I should go back.
[13:10] It's your decision to go back or not.
[13:15] But don't say that you over reacted.
[13:19] You got injured. It's not a minor thing.
[13:23] And what is the guarantee that he won't repeat this action again.
[13:28] We have seen a glimpse of his anger.
[13:32] Yes
[13:35] I am unable to understand his anger.
[13:37] He is so unpredictable.
[13:39] He argues with anyone anywhere anytime.
[13:41] He argued with policemen that night and stayed in lockup whole night.
What?
[13:46] Farhad stayed in lockup whole night.
[13:48] Aunt
[13:49] That was not his fault but...
But he couldn't control his anger.
[13:55] Listen my child, you don't have to give justifications on his behalf.
[13:59] I know that you are very sensible.
[14:02] And you know Farhad more than both of us.
[14:06] Am I right?
[14:09] If you are unable to understand his behavior then I think you shouldn't go back now.
[14:16] I think you and Farhad should spend some time by staying away from each other.
[14:21] Am I right Shaggo?
[14:22] Yes
[14:24] I was thinking
[14:27] That you should stay here with us for few more days.
[14:31] And think with a cool mind that what you should do.
[14:36] And
[14:38] I think first we should think about finishing this breakfast.
Yes, come on.
[14:43] Let's go.
Let me pick this.
[14:46] No.
[14:48] Come with me, I will give you breakfast.
[15:25] Farhad
[15:29] You are back.
[15:43] Where do you go by leaving your mother?
[15:49] I am here mom.
[15:54] I stay awake whole night because of you.
[16:03] You should sleep.
[16:16] My son is tired as well.
[16:41] Yes, I am very tired.
[17:18] She has gotten us into trouble.
[17:24] Let me talk to Farhad.
[17:26] But I think he is already angry with me.
[17:30] What should I do?
[17:34] Let me call Zara.
[17:50] Greetings aunt, how are you
[17:53] I have been calling you for so long.
[17:56] Why weren't you receiving my call?
[17:58] I was busy in household chores.
[18:00] So I thought to call you after getting free.
[18:03] Is everything alright?
[18:05] You seem a bit worried.
[18:08] Zara
[18:10] There is a very big problem.
[18:13] Which problem
[18:14] Is everything alright? Has uncle said anything to you?
[18:18] No, there is nothing like that.
[18:24] The issue is between Fareeha and Farhad.
[18:29] What happened between Fareeha and Farhad?
[18:33] Both of them were arguing and that argument became so intense that Farhad slapped Fareeha.
[18:40] What? When did it happen?
[18:43] It happened yesterday.
[18:45] And you are telling me now.
Don't be angry
[18:49] I was so confused, listen what happened next.
[18:53] When Fareeha reached home in injured condition then sister Rashida and brother Yousuf saw her.
[18:59] They saw her condition.
[19:02] So much happened and I have been informed now.
[19:06] Zara, you are sensible and you can understand.
[19:11] I am so confused.
[19:14] Brother Yousuf was so angry
[19:16] He was mad out of anger and he has forbidden Fareeha to go back.
[19:23] He was right in his anger. This is not a minor thing.
[19:28] OK don't worry.
[19:30] I am coming to meet you.
[19:33] If you will come then maybe she will share her feelings with you.
[19:37] She isn't telling anything and she is quiet.
[19:42] OK aunt, I am coming in while.
[19:46] Bye.
Come quickly. Bye.
[19:56] We should give us some time.
[20:02] We should think by staying away from each other that what do we want from each other.
[20:06] But that will increase distances.
[20:56] Hi. How are you Fareeha.
[21:01] I am fine.
[21:03] Where have you got injury?
[21:06] Tell me, I will take you to doctor.
[21:20] You know that I can't hurt you.
[21:28] That was just a mistake.
[21:37] Please forgive me. That won't happen again.
[21:41] It's my promise.
[21:51] I know Farhad that you didn't push me so that I may hurt.
[21:55] That just happened.
[22:02] You didn't beat your manager intentionally and that happened.
[22:09] You didn't argue with policemen intentionally and that happened.
[22:16] You didn't misbehaved with my uncle and aunt that just happened.
[22:25] Farhad what will happen next just because you can't control your anger.
[22:32] I am getting scared now.
[22:35] We will fix everything.
[22:36] Farhad, I don't know about the reason of your anger.
[22:40] Your family, job, restaurant or at me.
[22:48] But whatever that is
[22:52] That is effecting us and weakening our relationship.
[23:02] We should give ourselves some time.
[23:09] We should think by staying away from each other that what do we want from each other.
[23:13] Only distances will increase if we stay away from each other.
[23:22] Why are you giving me such a big punishment?
[23:24] Farhad, I am not punishing you.
[23:30] I just want some time so that my wounds may heal. I need some space.
[23:39] I called you to tell about that.
[24:20] What's the matter? Why are you that much angry?
[24:24] Fareeha reached aunt's house with injuries and mom and dad were also there.
[24:29] They told me that Farhad beat her and now everyone is worried for her.
[24:34] What are you talking about?
[24:37] Did dad forgive her?
[24:39] Just leave forgiveness, he is talking about bringing her back in this house.
[24:43] Not at all.
[24:44] This is not possible.
[24:46] If Fareeha came back here then I won't spare a single second to leave this house.
[24:51] Why are you getting depressed?
[24:54] I won't let her come back in this house and by the way we won't stay in this house.
[25:00] We will go to our own house which will be ours only.
[25:02] I have been listening this for so long.
[25:05] And I am observing that how everyone roams around us.
[25:09] To do buttering.
[25:12] And you got fooled by that.
There is nothing like that.
[25:15] But what's wrong with that?
[25:17] What's wrong if my family members are pampering my wife.
[25:21] Once the shop is sold then you will buy the house of your choice. Right
[25:27] When you finalize the deal?
[25:29] That hotel owner has already bought all shops of the mall and he will definitely buy our shop as well.
[25:37] That will happen if your dad get convinced.
[25:39] That hotel owner is a very famous builder.
[25:41] He will convince dad. He belongs to our community as well.
[25:45] And why are you getting depressed? You just take rest. Eat well and relax.
[26:06] Today, there were very few customers.
[26:09] Today we only received two orders.
[26:17] How are you Farhad.
[26:20] Why are you here?
[26:22] There are no customers on your shop.
[26:24] So the food must be remaining, bring that for me.
[26:32] Anyways, jokes apart
[26:36] But this business was running because of dad's name.
[26:40] I don't think that anyone will come here now.
[26:44] We are trying to bring back our customers.
[26:48] It will get better slowly and gradually
[26:51] What if these two people also leave?
[26:55] Listen to me Farhad, I have some very good buyers.
[26:59] Talk to them and if you get a good deal then sell this restaurant.
[27:04] And you also want to get rid of it. I know that.
[27:10] This is Kiran's decision.
[27:13] After all she is the owner of this restaurant.
[27:16] Kiran is my wife and we have same opinion.
[27:22] But dad didn't want to sell this restaurant.
[27:27] If dad were here then he would have managed it well.
[27:30] But you know it very well that we are unable to manage it.
[27:34] I am busy in bank and Kiran can't come here.
[27:39] And her brother has left her long ago.
[27:43] Now how long will you try to save this sinking boat.
[27:48] Listen Farhad, I am presenting you a life jacket.
[27:52] It would be better to sell this restaurant.
[28:02] It's a family business.
[28:06] And family will decide whether to sell this business or not.
[28:10] Let me talk to everyone. Let's see what they say.
[28:13] Yes sure
[28:14] Talk to them and have their opinion.
[28:18] Tell me after that.
[28:19] And take my help if you need anything.
[28:25] Let me see the kitchen. Excuse me.
OK
[28:44] What's the matter? Why isn't she responding.
[28:49] Should I call her?
[28:52] This looks awkward, she will think that I am bothering her.
[28:57] But it's important to call her. Didn't she lost her phone.
[29:12] Hi
[29:14] Thank God, you received my call.
[29:17] I have been sending you messages since morning but you are not responding.
[29:20] I thought that your phone got snatched.
[29:22] Oh sorry, I couldn't see that. Actually the thing is
[29:26] That my balance was zero and my mother is not feeling well so I have brought her to hospital.
[29:33] Didn't you find any shop on the way, you should have recharge your balance.
[29:37] Actually the point is that...
What's the matter? Why are you so shy?
[29:43] Tell me.
[29:44] How could I tell you because I had no balance.
[29:48] You should have called me but you didn't do that.
[29:52] Actually, I thought it will be awkward to call you.
[29:56] You would think that I am bothering you.
[29:59] Well, what are you talking about?
[30:01] Our relation is not that weak that I will think like that.
[30:05] You say such things sometimes which feel bad.
[30:10] It's your generosity.
[30:12] Don't worry, I will recharge your balance.
[30:16] OK, thank you so much.
[30:19] No need to thank. Just tell me if you need anything else.
[30:26] OK take care. Bye.
I will recharge your phone balance.
[30:31] OK, good bye Jojo.
[30:50] Wow, he recharged my balance. He is so quick.
[31:14] What have you thought about your future?
[31:18] I don't know
[31:20] I told him that I need some time.
[31:30] You must be thinking that I forbade her so this is right reward for her.
[31:35] What are you talking about?
[31:37] You know it very well that I can't even think like that.
[31:41] You can see that uncle and aunt are still favoring you.
[31:47] Everyone wants your betterment.
[31:52] Do you know that I hugged dad that day
[31:56] Then I realized that I was missing his love and kindness so much.
[32:05] I mean I have hurt him so much
[32:08] But he couldn't bear to see me in pain and he forgot everything suddenly.
[32:15] If someone loves us unconditionally and without any reward
[32:19] Then that is only parents' love for their children
[32:25] You have given Farhad some time to think so you should also think.
[32:31] Will you go back and resume such a relationship where you may choose one among your family and husband?
[32:57] Mom
[33:00] Mom. Hmm
Why didn't you get ready?
[33:04] I have taken your appointment with doctor.
[33:07] I don't want to go anywhere.
[33:15] But why?
[33:19] I want to sleep.
[33:21] Mom.
You know about my condition.
[33:24] Tell them about my condition and bring medicine.
[33:28] Mom, this is not the right thing.
[33:31] If doctor won't check you then how can he tell us about the problem.
[33:38] As you know that I can't walk more.
[33:46] No one can cure my disease.
[33:49] You will only waste your money and time.
[33:52] Mom
[33:55] You promised me.
[33:58] You promised me that you will go to doctor.
[34:02] So let's go.
[34:04] Please go to doctor, for my sake please.
[34:07] She is a good doctor and she will give good treatment. Let's go.
[34:11] Please
[34:13] Won't she lock me in a madhouse?
[34:17] No
[34:19] I won't allow them to inject any injection.
[34:22] OK
[34:24] Let's go
[35:16] Your reports are absolutely normal.
[35:19] Didn't I tell you.
[35:21] Everything is normal. Let's go.
Doctor
[35:24] Mom faces difficulty in breathing normally.
[35:27] Just like as if her breath is stopping.
[35:31] Her hands and feet get cool.
[35:34] Her heartbeat increases.
[35:37] And she feels uncomfortable.
[35:41] She starts to cry and then she keeps lying on the bed for so many days.
[35:45] Stop it Farhad.
[35:47] She doesn't have any courage to do anything
[35:51] When doctor has told you that all reports are normal then why are you telling her about that?
[35:54] Not necessarily everything can be revealed from reports.
[35:59] Don't worry. Tell me if you have any worry or stress.
[36:07] Doctor, my dad passed away recently.
I am sorry to hear that.
[36:14] Tell me that this condition has started recently.
[36:21] I have been observing this since my childhood.
[36:25] The intensity increases and decreases.
[36:28] Is it severe these days.
[36:31] Yes.
[36:33] Why are you asking about that. It has no connection with my disease.
[36:37] Everyone has problems in his life.
There is a connection.
[36:41] Your pulse is increased while your are sitting here and your blood pressure has also increased.
[36:47] Are you feeling anything right now?
[36:48] Is this start like this?
[36:56] Listen, when you feel that you are entering that phase then there are some techniques.
[37:01] Take a deep breathe in, just like me. Look at me.
[37:13] Take in for four seconds.
[37:16] And hold if for second from outside.
[37:20] Do it again.
[37:22] And then release it. Do it again.
[37:25] Now tell me what are you feeling now?
[37:28] Is your pulse coming down.
[37:41] Study it thoroughly, there are so many good techniques which will help you.
[37:46] Doctor why does this happen to me?
[37:51] Sometime the traumas and sorrows are stuck in our body.
