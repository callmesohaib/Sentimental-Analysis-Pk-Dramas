[02:10] We had been together for 3 decades. We saw the world changing. 
[02:15] We saw time changing.
[02:19] But one thing, that even time couldn't change.
[02:24] It was the love Channo and I had.
[02:45] Not that we didn't fight. We argued everyday.
[02:57] But Channo and I didn't let our story reach the end.
[03:08] We didn't let our love reach the end.
[03:15] When we're young, we have a lot of passion. 
[03:20] We feel our relationship will end on even the smallest arguments. Like everything will end.
[03:29] But some people have God's hands over them. 
[03:34] He keeps their hearts and souls attached to each other.
[03:40] No matter how much we destroy ourselves, how much we argue, but,
[03:49] when God blesses us, everything is alright. Love blossoms once again.
[04:01] She used to make a lot of noise but she left and I didn't even know.
[04:11] The pain of love is very important. 
[04:18] This allows our pain and happiness to become one.
[04:26] Channo took away all my pain and gave me her happiness like this.
[04:38] Like this..
[04:44] Channo gave me her life and her love. 
[04:51] The rest of my life will now be spent with her memories.
[05:00] If my God can give me just one more day with Channo, I can bear a thousand similar pains.
[09:45] Both of us are weird.
Yes.
[09:52] We did everything in a chaos. 
[09:55] We fell in love but didn't make our families accept it and set out on our journey.
[10:04] But this time we'll do everything right.
[10:17] I have told my family that if they're not happy with our relationship, I'll call it off.
[10:28] There's no rush. 
[10:32] If I have to spend my entire life to get your family's consent, I will.
[10:36] I'll fall in their feet and do as they say, but,
[10:47] I cannot live without you Fareeha.
[10:53]  I don't want a Romeo Juliet love story. 
[10:58] I want an ordinary life.
[11:01] With you. 
[11:05] I don't want any romance.
[11:10] I want love, Fareeha.
[11:15] I don't want to run anymore. I want to settle down.
[11:25] Only with you.
[11:32] Do you know I've started therapy for anger management?
Huh?
[11:42] I took my mom but I realized that I needed it more for myself.
[11:53] Didn't you realize it a little too soon?
[12:07] Fareeha I have complete fate we can spend a beautiful life. 
[12:14] We have God on our side.
[12:20] We're soul mates.
[12:38] Thank you.
[12:47] Does it still hurt? 
[12:50] He wounded you bad.
[12:55] Thank God, you got rid of him. But there is something, thats,
[13:05] not letting me sleep at night.
What do you think?
[13:15] Does he have no accountability? 
[13:18] He can do anything he wants. He's sitting comfortably without any regrets.
[13:24] I'm scared what if he does the same thing with someone else, the things he did to you.
[13:34] What can we do?
[13:37] We can file a case against him.
[13:43] Mom, do you even realize what you're saying? Such cases are not easy.
[13:49] I have not filed any FIR against his abuse. You know people will ask uncountable questions.
[13:58] Was I sleeping? Why do I remember now? Did I just wake up?
[14:06] Life won't be easy, mom. 
[14:10] It'll become a mess.
[14:18] If only we can find a good lawyer and proofs.
[14:24] This case is difficult but not impossible. We can win.
[14:33] Any old doctor's reports? Anything?
[14:43] I do have a proof.
What?
[14:47] I have a video. I was sitting in my room and doing something.
[14:53] He entered all of a sudden and started hitting me. My hand touched the camera and the video was recorded.
[14:59] I have that video. I have it.
[15:09] Then we can file a case and win it.
[15:17] Yes. Yes.
[15:30] If only I had seen these wounds earlier.
[15:33]  You used to come all the time.
[15:37] Your eyes told your story but I just didn't want to listen to it.
[15:50] Its alright.
[16:23] Oh you son of a king? We have five containers to mix. Who'll do it?
[16:36] There is a secret to everyone's success and this is our secret.
[16:41] Don't mix them here. Its a secret. 
[16:43] Until we put in our share in our work, we don't get anything in return.
[17:41] Come on stand up and I'll tell you how its done. Good boy.
[17:47] Put your hands here. Pull it towards yourself and shake it. Again. Be careful.
[17:55] Enough. Again. Shake it again.
[18:01] Yes. Just be careful.
[18:14] Biryani is a thing on its own but the real deal is the mixing of the container.
[18:21] You're only taught this with your mother's prayers and a good mentor.
[18:26]  If there's even a small mistake, the fresh rice, like your bright face,
[18:31] will wilt down..
[19:10] Farhad, this is so good.
[19:14] Really?
[19:16] Farhad, I'm telling you the truth. I've never eaten such good Biryani ever.
[19:27] Fareeha. Dad taught everybody everything here. He just didn't teach them one step.
[19:34] And it was the mixing of the Biryani. 
[19:37] I used to tell him it won't make a difference but now I've realized.
[19:44] Every single step is important
[19:46] I feel I'm eating Biryani made my brother Yaqoob, for the first time after he passed away.
[19:57] Don't worry Shamshad. We have our old taste back. 
[20:00] We'll have our old customers back as well.
[20:07] I'm so happy for you. I've never seen you this confident ever.
[20:18] If you're with me. We can achieve anything.
[20:26] We just need mom and dad's approval.
We'll do it.
[20:36] Will you meet dad today?
Whenever you say.
[20:42] I think lets meet dad alone first. Lets make him agree
[20:47]  because if he does, everybody else will.
[20:52] Alright. He'll be alone on the shop today. Lets go today.
[20:57] As you say.
[21:00] Listen, you've made me taste biryani but I've heard the korma is good too. Make me taste that.
[21:06] Yes, the korma is good too. Ashraf, bring a plate.
[21:11] Why just a plate? Get me a flatbread too.
[21:14] Yes. Ashraf, get a flatbread along too.
[21:18] I was thinking. Get me a dessert as well since you're ordering so much.
[21:26] Of course. Ashraf, get a korma, flatbread and rice pudding too.
[21:31] Just one? Aren't you eating?
[21:35] I will not share my rice pudding. I'm telling you. Get your own.
[21:40] Ashraf, get korma, flat bread and.. 
[21:44] in fact bring everything that's in the kitchen.
[21:49] They'll think I eat too much. You eat this. I'll wait for korma.
No. We have a full pot inside. You eat.
[22:34] Is dad there?
Brother Yousuf isn't here yet.
[22:38] Dad's not here?
[22:48] What are the two of you doing here?
[22:50] We're here to talk, brother Saqib.
[22:53] See, I don't want to hear anything. Go away. Why did you bring him here?
[22:58] We're just here to talk.
[23:01] Brother Saqib. Please listen to me once.
Get out.
[23:05] I want to talk to you.
See, don't create a scene here. Go.
[23:12] Get lost.
[24:50] Don't worry Fareeha. Nothing will happen to Farhad.
[25:01] Be strong.
How did this happen?
[25:05] Farhad took the bullet meant for me.
[25:08] Bottalwala's goon shot at me and Farhad came in front.
[25:13] Dad..
[25:14] If something happens to Farhad, what will I do?
No..
[25:20] Nothing will happen. God will save him.
[25:24] I was holding him by the collar a while ago.
[25:28] And the next moment, he took the bullet meant for me and fell down
[25:32] Oh God..
[25:34] Please God keep all my children save.
[25:45] What did I do? I made a big mistake.
[25:54] What happened?
What happened mom? Mom?
[26:04] I hid something from you people.
What is it?
[26:11] When your dad was hospitalized and needed blood. 
[26:18] It was Farhad who donated his blood for your dad.
[26:27] What are you saying? Why did you hide this from me?
[26:33] I was very selfish.
[26:37] I made a mistake because I saw my family becoming one, once again. Please forgive me.
[26:52] Oh my God. I made a big mistake to understand the child. All of us made a mistake.
[27:01] Your father has blood in his body and your brother is breathing because of a man who doesn't belong to our community.
[27:14] Oh God.. please forgive me. Forgive me.
[27:23] I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake.
[27:33] Oh God.. I made a mistake.
[29:33] Everything will be alright. Don't worry.
[29:43] Don't worry. God will make everything alright. I'm praying just like you are.
[29:55] When God will hear two mothers praying together, He'll definitely hear us.
[30:07] Why have you guys created a crowd here? 
[30:12] The patient can only have his family members here. 
[30:16] Please the rest of you can leave.
[30:24] Until we get any news from inside, nobody will leave.
[30:30] Let the doctor come and we'll leave. See..
[30:37] Everybody is my family.
But sir..
[30:41] And nobody will leave until they get a good news about Farhad..
[30:47] But sir.. it isn't allowed.
Enough..
[31:13] Your patient is conscious now.
[31:23] The operation is successful. You can meet him now.
Oh..
[32:06] Farhad.. I'm here with you.
[32:16] Thank God..
[32:46] Fareeha.. Everybody is here. Am I dead?
[33:10] Coming. Who is it now?
[33:16] What happened sir?
Are you Shahzain?
[33:20] Yes sir but I think you're mistaken.
Mistaken.. you fool!
[33:25] We're here to take you. Come along.
[33:26] But sir, whats my fault? I'm a respectable man.
[33:30] You hit a woman and call yourself respectable?
[33:33] Come along.
Wait a minute. Listen to me. Sir, I didn't do anything.
[33:42] Sir, somebody is taking revenge against me. Sir, I'm a respectable man.
[33:47] I didn't do anything. I'm telling the truth. Brother?
[33:55] Brother.. I didn't do anything. I swear.
[34:02] We need a double plate of biryani. Two khausay and four hot flat breads.
[34:08] Hurry up with the orders.
Isn't it a little too crowded today?
[34:11] Ever since you came, the business has doubled. 
[34:15] Everybody loves the new menu. You should have come earlier.
[34:18] Shamshad? Put the butter on the flat bread, not Kiran.
[34:23] No brother Farhad..
[34:25] Brother, I had been telling this since day one. She is farsighted.
[34:33] I've never been proud.
[34:38] Don't be extra. Have you seen the time?
[34:41]  You're always late. 
[34:45] Do you want to be late for your anniversary party? Its evening.
[34:50] Is the food ready?
Yes. Absolutely ready.
[34:52] Lets just pick up the food and leave.
[35:03] Hurry up. Wait.. Stop at a place.
Its almost done..
[35:13] Come on, Jojo. Don't be so angry. Its not good for health.
[35:20] I'll tell you about meditation to relax. 
[35:22] You have to breathe in from your stomach. 
[35:25] Not from your chest. Thats why you get angry.
[35:31] Uncle, what happened? You haven't blown the other balloons yet. There are so many left.
[35:36] I've blown in all the air I had.
[35:39] Hello? Isn't it done yet?
[35:41] I can't open the tape.
[35:43] You'll only be able to see the tape if you move your hair.
[35:45] I don't have curls like you.
[35:53] It looks very yummy but isn't it a bit too small?
[36:00] Its because of you people, we're infamous.
[36:04] Such a small cake?
[36:06] I thought we're such a sweet family. We'll manage.
[36:57] The spread is beautiful. 
[37:00] I feel our food brings us all together. It doesn't divide us.
[37:07] You're absolutely right. Now since our stomachs have become one, our hearts will become one soon.
[37:13] Of course. Where are our Romeo and Juliet?
Yes, where are they?
[39:28] Happy anniversary.
[39:35] Happy anniversary.
[39:39] You're the sweetness in my life.
[39:46] Promise?
Promise.
[39:52] Want some?
[40:00] Here..
[40:03] Fareeha?
[40:04] Alright. Okay.
[40:08] Fareeha..
Come get it if you can.
