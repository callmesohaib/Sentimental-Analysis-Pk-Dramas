[00:13] Don't even think about giving Shah-Zain a single plate, let alone the entire business. 
[00:17] He cannot be trusted.
[00:22] You are right. Have you forgotten how much dowry they asked us?
[00:27] Did you want something?
[00:35] The catering business.
[00:38]  What do you mean, Shahzain?
[00:39]  You now what I mean, Kiran
[00:42] Did you talk to your brother?
[00:44] What are you doing with my son's phone? 
[00:47] Have you no shame?
[00:49] Do you have any idea how much pain you're causing your parents?
[00:54]  Why don't you leave? 
[01:03] Oh Wow! Look Jojo
[01:05] there is so much of rush in your gym
[01:09] The people who hadn't been coming for a month are now working out since this morning
[01:18] Excuse me, sir. I would like to get a membership at your gym. Could you please show me your packages?
[01:23] one second
[01:27] fill this
[01:29] and paste a very nice picture too
[01:36] Please give me a form as well.
[01:41] here you go
[01:50] these 2 cauldrons needs to be delivered between 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
[01:56] there is so much of rush in the afternoon
[01:58] from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM there is hardly any work
[02:01] and the rush starts after 6:00 PM
[02:05] Okay
[02:10] Sir, are the 6 cauldrons of biryani ready?
[02:18] brother Farhad
[02:19] yes
[02:20] after brother Yaqoob's demise, I was taking less order of Biryani
[02:25] I try to mix in the same manner
[02:29] But the customer complains that it doesn't taste the same
[02:33] would you like to try?
[02:41] Can anybody else do this work?
[02:45] its in front of you
[02:47] Shamshad, it was all because of my dad's respect
[02:51] How does mixing improve the taste of Biryani?
[02:54] Whatever is cooked, is cooked!
[02:57] Does any other catering company do that?
[02:59] brother Yaqoob used to say, it makes us different from others
[03:09] It doesn't make any difference who mixes the Biryani.
[03:12] anyone can do that
[03:14] hurry up, the delivery shouldn't get late
[03:18] okay
[03:31] I want to talk to you
[03:33] yes, speak up
[03:34] Saqib has become quiet now after hearing about his baby's birth, but...
[03:39] he will discuss that business related matter again
[03:44] what are you trying to say?
[03:47] I am trying to say that...
[03:51] I don't want Saqib to leave this house along with his wife & kids
[03:56] and we shall become alone
[04:00] means, you want me to sell of my family business. Right?
[04:06] I shall close down my business due to the threats against your dearest son and the demand for money
[04:15] I don't want this
[04:17] I'm just suggesting that you should make Saqib sit down and talk to him
[04:23] Maybe there is another solution.
[04:26] what another solution we'll get?
[04:29] Now, you see, I had money at the time when Khalid demanded it
[04:34] I gave him his entire share
[04:37] got the shop transferred on my name, so that the business shall stay within the family
[04:42] I don't have this power anymore
[04:46] I need to sell my shop in order to give money to Saqib, which I won't do
[04:50] There might be a solution where the shop doesn't get sold, and Saqib is also satisfied
[04:58] they don't understand, I had made it for my children
[05:02] Since its a family business, its our honor. Its shall stay within our family
[05:07] how can I auction my honor by coming into their insistence?
[05:12] I won't be able to do it
[05:16] Okay, at least talk to Saqib
[05:20] maybe he understands your point and...
[05:25] as it is, you have made all this for your children
[05:29] So, what's the use of it if our children won't be there with us?
[06:24] what's the matter, who is calling?
[06:26] why aren't you picking it up?
[06:27] or you don't want to talk in front of me
[06:43] no mom, there isn't any such thing. Its Farhad calling, he might be calling for something important
[06:48] I will call him back once I am done with the work
[06:50] you hardly have any interest in doing the work
[06:52] you talk to your family the entire day
[06:54] I am taking your phone away, you can take it at night
[06:57] do your work
[07:19] do tell them to double check it
[07:21] Farhad
[07:23] Great!
[07:26] its good to see you here
[07:29] you here, all good?
[07:31] yes, all good
[07:39] I came to lessen my heart's burden
[07:44] what kind of a burden?
[07:48] hey, you drink it
[07:50] No you drink it, I will order more
[07:53] whatever happened between you & me
[07:57] I am so ashamed & came to apologize
[08:02] Do you know, I've realized after Dad's demise that life is completely meaningless
[08:13] and these relations & connections...
[08:16] this is all & we need to take care of them in a proper manner
[08:24] so, have you forgiven me?
[08:28] what are you saying?
[08:30] I should apologize to you for irritating you as well
[08:33] let it go, they are old matters. Lets leave them
[08:39] by the way, do you know
[08:42] I got so amazed when dad had transferred his business on Kiran's name
[08:48] its obvious, Kiran cannot sit here at the shop
[08:52] and what is my work over here?
[08:55] I don't have any experience though
[08:58] and do you know
[08:59] when an unskilled person handles the business
[09:02] then his condition becomes exactly...
[09:06] like this biscuit
[09:09] it drowns
[09:13] as far as I know...
[09:15] even you don't have any interest in this business
[09:19] you are a BBA graduate
[09:21] You should be holding an executive position in a multinational company, wearing a suit and tie
[09:27] so why are you after these cauldrons?
[09:30] in between the fragrance of spices or so
[09:35] my friend, I think this is not your place
[09:38] and along with father
[09:41] this kitchen's time is also over
[09:44] I think, you can get good buyers for this
[09:51] anyways...
[09:54] I shall leave now, as I am getting late.
[09:56] But feel free to let me know if you have any work, without any hesitation. Okay?
[10:02] Take care
[10:30] mom
[10:33] what's the matter?
[10:36] mom, I need my phone
[10:41] I want to talk to Shahzain
[10:44] I understand very well whom you want to talk to by using Shahzain as an excuse
[10:50] Oh God, what are girls nowadays? They can't live without their phones
[10:55] In our times, we never used to talk back in front of our mother-in-law
[11:00] you will not get the phone
[11:03] go, let me watch the TV now
[11:11] now leave!
[11:12] why are you standing here?
[11:19] she has spoiled my entire mood
[12:09] Fariha, I am sorry
[12:16] I shouldn't have talked to you like this
[12:23] Farhad look, I know you are in stress
[12:26] and I want to be supportive
[12:31] I don't want us to fight
[12:35] I only want you not to forget us in all this
[12:40] it will never happen, Fariha
[12:44] I just need some time, I will convince my mom
[12:51] Do you know, we've been trying to make people understand ever since we got married
[12:55] and we fail every time like always
[13:00] Why do you think you will succeed this time?
[13:03] why do you think that you will be able to convince your mother?
[13:12] I will convince her
[13:15] what if she didn't agree then?
[13:31] yes mom, greetings!
[13:34] mom, why are you crying?
[13:39] please stop crying, I am coming
[13:42] mom, I am telling you that I am coming
[13:50] I know... you shall go
[14:24] mom
[14:26] mom, what happened? Get a grip on yourself
[14:30] what happened?
[14:31] I can't breathe without you
[14:33] I can't breathe
[14:35] oh mom, please compose yourself
[14:50] mom, I've been watching this since my childhood
[14:55] that you get breathless
[14:59] and how you say that you are feeling anxious
[15:04] Me insisting for you to go to the doctor, and your continuous refusal
[15:12] and to sit for so many hours while holding your hand
[15:17] I've been watching this since my childhood, mom
[15:22] the reason behind it is not Fariha
[15:24] what do you think?
[15:26] Am I lying? Or my condition is fake?
[15:31] its not fake
[15:32] I know, you are not lying
[15:35] I'm only saying that it's a disease and the doctor has its treatment. Come to the doctor with me.
[15:40] There is no treatment. I've got all my tests done. All are fine.
[15:45] there is no treatment of this disease
[15:49] you are absolutely fine physically
[15:53] These panic attacks that you get are mental issues.
[15:57] I am not a psycho patient!
[15:59] I am not!
[16:02] I am not...
[16:03] What will you do? Will you send me to a mental asylum because your father is dead?
[16:07] I am not crazy. I am not!
[16:09] oh mom...
[16:11] having a mental issue doesn't mean that one is crazy
[16:15] what are you saying then, tell me
[16:20] I do have an idea
[16:28] I do have an idea of what sort of life you had spent.
[16:31] I know everything
[16:37] when a person makes himself very strong to stand with his loved ones then...
[16:46] He gets broken from within.
[16:53] If it had been the treatment for your illness, then...
[16:56] I swear to God, I would have kept holding your hand for an entire day, in fact, for a lifetime
[17:01] this is not the treatment, I don't have its treatment
[17:03] then how am I breathing?
[17:07] I can breathe now
[17:09] just pray, I can breathe now
[17:13] mom
[17:18] mom, you need help
[17:20] we have to go to the doctor
[17:27] believe me, we need to see a doctor
[17:31] will you go for my sake?
[17:57] I had gone to visit the catering house today
[18:00] your romeo like brother was sitting there, & killing the flies
[18:06] Kiran, I don't think so that Farhad can handle all this
[18:11] and I have said this to him as well
[18:14] that end this all, sell it off. He shall sell it off instead of ruining it
[18:34] Kiran look...
[18:36] I have explained him in very clear words
[18:40] now don't complaint to me that what I have done, if he doesn't understands
[18:47] hey... why are you being afraid?
[18:50] I haven't done anything as of yet
[18:54] and if you want me not to do anything & stay as good as I am
[18:58] then you have to compel Farhad to sell off the catering business
[19:05] Understand?
[19:11] Don't know why don't you guys understand such a simple thing?
[19:15] I don't understand this
[19:34] Farhad!
[19:35] here you go
[19:37] please keep it, we don't need them. We can take care of ourselves
[19:40] there is no need to return them, Shaggo didn't mean that
[19:43] please keep it, thank you so much!
[19:45] but dear...
[19:47] no, its okay
[20:34] Greetings aunt Shaggo, how are you?
[20:37] how is Hamid uncle?
[20:39] we all are fine..
[20:41] how are you?
[20:42] did Farhad come home?
[20:45] He did. He came for some time and then went back.
[20:50] Fariha, this is so wrong
[20:52] it means, you are all alone the entire night since so many days
[20:56] by the way, Farhad has crossed all the limits of carelessness
[21:01] I agree that his family needs him the most at this time
[21:05] But he does have some responsibility towards you.
[21:11] Aunty, what can that poor guy do? He got shattered into two pieces.
[21:15] it doesn't mean that he shall leave you completely alone
[21:19] do one thing
[21:21] come to our house for a few days
[21:24] And you can go back once Farhad comes back.
[21:28] No, I have already disturbed you guys a lot. I won't do it anymore.
[21:34] Fariha...
[21:36] you are being formal for no reason
[21:39] I don't think it's appropriate for you to stay alone for the entire night.
[21:45] There's nothing formal about it, aunty. 
You know I'll call you if I need anything.
[21:52] As it is, my neighbors are so good. They take very good care of me
[21:55] For now, I am fine. Also, slowly and gradually, I am becoming accustomed to living alone.
[22:00] I will tell you if something happens
[22:02] Fariha...
[22:03] I will talk to you later, ok?
[22:05] bye!
[22:14] Don't know why this girl doesn't listen to me.
[22:20] Shaggo, I think she is being formal
[22:25] hmm...
[22:27] Maybe she is thinking that I will mind her frequent stays here.
[22:35] Shaggo
[22:36] yes
[22:37] Both of us will go tomorrow and bring her here ourselves.
[22:44] really?
yes
[22:47] I won't be able to see you worried for her like this.
[22:51] we'll go tomorrow & bring her here. Ok?
[22:56] thank you!
[23:12] I had explained you earlier, that the builders are buying that entire area
[23:16] they are soon going to build a very big shopping mall & plaza
[23:20] I had talked to my dad, but he is not agreeing. What shall I say to him now?
[23:27] then try explaining brother Yousuf
[23:29] Almost all the shopkeepers in that area have accepted the offer.
[23:33] and those people will get the benefit too
[23:35] Even I want to leave this shop, but my father doesn't want to
[23:40] Let me convince him
[23:43] See, you are wise person. Try to agree your father
[23:49] See, right now I am talking to you
[23:51] But if all the shops in that area get sold out and only your shop is left
[23:56] then...
[23:58] the builders buy the foul properties in a different manner
[24:02] and you know their way of doing it very well. Look...
[24:05] right now, you'll get very good price of this shop
[24:11] If brother Yousuf and the builders came face to face, then...
[24:16] You will lose your shop, your money, as well as your respect
[24:20] You guys will be left empty-handed
[24:22] I won't let this happen
[24:26] Okay, prepare the shop's sale deed. I will get it signed from him
[24:33] this is very wise of you, let me get the documents prepared
[24:37] but agree brother Yousuf properly
[24:40] what if he refuse while being emotional
[24:42] nothing as such will happen
[24:45] alright then, I am leaving
[25:00] aunty!
[25:01] Greetings!
my child...
[25:05] you guys are here, all of a sudden?
[25:07] actually Fariha, there is such a big problem. Can we sit & talk?
[25:12] please come
[25:21] actually...
[25:24] the matter is... dear, kindly have some mercy on me
[25:31] what do you mean?
[25:34] you stay here all alone the entire night
[25:37] And this Aunt Shaggo of yours stays worried for you for an entire night.
[25:41] and our night's sleep gets ruined
[25:46] oh Hamid, I was so scared
[25:52] Uncle, you people will be bothered because of me for no reason
[25:56] your uncle is absolutely correct!
[25:59] we won't be bothered but out worries will get over. Come with us
[26:05] ok fine, let me talk to Farhad
[26:07] yes...
ok?
[26:09] Farhad
[26:11] hey!
Greetings!*
[26:15] Farhad...
[26:19] sorry to hear about your father
[26:24] dear, a father's demise is a lifetime grief
[26:30] we wanted to come for the condolences but it wasn't appropriate. So we didn't come
[26:36] No, its enough for me that you've said it. Please sit
[26:43] is everything fine?
[26:45] yes, actually Fariha is completely alone here & its very unsafe for her to stay here all alone in this area
[26:55] Yes, in fact I was telling Fariha to stay at your house for a few days
[26:58] yes, she is most welcome. That's why we are here to pick her
[27:04] Farhad, as it is your family needs your more at this time
[27:11] yes yes, absolutely. Dear, give time to your family
[27:15] but, its important to take care of Fariha as well
She is managing everything alone
[27:21] what do you guys think, can't I take care of Fariha?
[27:24] No no.. 
[27:25] Farhad, they didn't mean that
[27:28] I know it very well that what do they mean
[27:32] in fact, its good that you guys came here today
[27:35] Fariha, have you returned their money?
[27:40] Farhad please... 
[27:44] what do you mean?
[27:46] you haven't returned their money as of yet?
[27:48] this... 
[27:50] Fariha
[27:51] Fariha please return their money right away, in front of me
[27:55] one minute, he is talking about which amount?
[27:59] let me... 
I mean, what are you talking about?
[28:01] when your wife came to our house for the first time, she gave her the money. 
[28:05] Because she thinks that I cannot take care of my wife
[28:07] No..  no
[28:07] I have kept my wife in such an unsafe & disgusting place, right?
[28:11] No no dear.. 
[28:12] its not like that, Shaggo must have given them so that it could become a little help for you guys. Nothing else
[28:19] out of concern
[28:22] yes
[28:23] Farhad! Farhad... 
[28:27] he didn't mean that, actually... 
[28:29] he seems a bit angry, right?
[28:31] No, maybe I think he is... 
[28:35] Farhad
[28:37] Farhad!
[28:38] here you go
[28:40] please keep it, we don't need them. We can take care of ourselves
[28:43] there is no need to return them, Shaggo didn't mean that
[28:46] please keep it, thank you so much!
[28:48] but dear... 
[28:50] no, its okay
[28:59] actually... 
[29:03] Anyways.. 
[29:06] Fariha, are you fine? Would you like to come with us?
[29:10] please come
[29:13] No, no aunty... I won't be able to go with you as I have to discuss something with Farhad
[29:24] ok fine, as you find better
[29:28] I think, we should leave now
[29:32] Both you and your husband should talk. We'll come again if you plan to visit our place. Okay?
[29:40] are you sure?
[29:41] yes yes
[29:43] Okay
lets go!
[29:46] okay dear
[29:49] sorry dear
[29:50] no, its ok
[29:57] Sorry, I didn't even ask about refreshments from you guys
[30:01] okay dear, take care
[30:04] bye!
[30:04] do call me
okay, thanks for visiting
[30:08] I will call you
[30:09] yes
[30:14] Wait! Where are you going now after saying too much?
[30:17] say it out whatever you want to!
[30:19] I've already said whatever I wanted to
[30:20] Farhad, you have no right to talk to my family like this. You have insulted my uncle and aunty
[30:28] and your uncle & aunty doesn't have any right to interfere in our lives
[30:32] Farhad, they weren't interfering
[30:34] they are family, they were concerned. They were just... 
[30:38] You shouldn't have talked to them like this
[30:40] And the way they talked to me, didn't you hear that?
[30:45] they were saying that I don't know how to take care of you, right?
[30:48] Farhad, you asked me to go to my aunt's house as I am alone
[30:52] So why do you mind it a lot when they came to pick me up now?
[30:56] Fariha, I haven't mind their visit
[30:58] But the way they were looking at our house with disdain, and trying to belittle us by offering you the money
[31:03] their attitude was still the same
[31:07] your mother came
[31:09] She bad-mouthed about me so much, she said everything imaginable on the phone
[31:13] I minded it a lot, but I didn't misbehave with her. I tolerated it
[31:18] don't talk about tolerance in front of me
[31:20] what not I had tolerated from your family's side?
[31:23] They had misbehaved with my father, with my mother... They even beat up my brother
[31:27] your brother tried to shoot me
[31:29] Your family had ousted my entire family from your house, do you remember?
[31:32] Didn't I tolerate everything?
[31:34] So what did your family do? Did they give us a hug?
[31:38] so, you guys had started it
[31:40] We? We people?
[31:43] First, you were blaming my family, and now you are going after my community!
[31:50] Fariha, you know I didn't mean that
[31:52] No, I don't know
[31:54] I don't know this new Farhad, nor I want to know
[32:00] And your dirty clothes! If I ever see them again, I will throw them off the balcony.
[32:18] Oh, why aren't the messages getting delivered?
[32:23] Also, I have refreshed it hundreds of times
[32:27] what if her phone got snatched?
[32:30] what if something happened to her?
[32:33] shall I call her?
[32:35] No, I shouldn't call
[32:37] it feels weird
[32:39] Brother Jojo, will Madam Billo come today or not?
[32:41] I was messaging her, but she is not replying. Maybe, she is on her way
[32:46] which way she is taking?
[32:47] you are saying the same thing since last 2 hours, is she coming from Hyderabad?
[32:51] I am not her PA. She will come if she wants to
[32:59] oh Billo.. 
[33:02] let me call her
[33:05] No, no.. 
[33:06] what will she think that I am after her
[33:09] let me message her then
[33:12] hello Billo!
[33:15] if you cannot come then kindly let us know
[33:30] Shaggo
[33:48] Shaggo, I want to say something. Please look here
[33:54] what is the meaning of silence?
[33:59] I don't want to talk to anyone right now
[34:03] yes, don't talk to anyone but at least you can talk to me
[34:09] Hamid, I don't want to talk to anyone
[34:13] I don't feel like talking to you as well
[34:16] let me be... 
[34:18] I was just trying to say that...
Enough!
[34:22] Not right now!
[34:29] okay fine
[35:09] peanuts?
[35:11] greetings Agha uncle, sorry I didn't see you coming
[35:15] You were lost in your thoughts, so how would you know who is coming and going?
[35:19] what plan are you making?
[35:23] What happened? Is everything fine?
It seems like you've fought again with Farhad, right?
[35:31] it seems that we always fight, Agha uncle
[35:34] he finds all of my words wrong
[35:39] and how do you find his words?
[35:46] hmm... 
[35:49] When a husband and a wife cannot understand each other's words, it means there is something very wrong
[35:55] what do they say in English?
"Communication Gap"
[35:59] Fariha, the problem is that you and Farhad have forgotten each other's languages.
[36:06] The solution is to sit somewhere peacefully with a calm mind.
[36:11] For sure, he might understand you, and you will understand him
[36:15] yes
[36:20] If Farhad annoys you a lot, then tell me. I will pull his ears
[36:25] he irritates such a good girl, he made you upset
[36:30] leave it
[36:32] have some peanuts
[36:35] they are cold
[36:37] Obviously! My peanuts became cold while talking about your fight with Farhad
[36:41] come, lets bring fresh peanuts. The peanut cart is at the end of our alley
[36:46] we'll get two packets. One for you & one for me. Ok?
[36:50] by the way you eat a lot, but where does it go?
[36:54] come on my dear
[36:56] there are so many benefits of hot peanuts
[36:59] it takes away all the tension
come
[37:07] come on
[37:15] Greetings dad!
[37:17] hey Greetings! Saqib dear, come. You & here?
[37:21] can't I come?
[37:23] No no, come... I want you to come here daily & handle the shop related work
[37:31] Dad, it's your heartiest desire, but you can see how fast this market is changing
[37:37] they are building very big malls & plazas over there
[37:40] Do you think anyone will come down this small alley looking for our shop while leaving behind the plaza?
[37:46] so what?
[37:47] therefore, the people who are far-sighted are selling off their shops
[37:51] They got a good price; they have saved themselves from the loss.
[37:55] Qasim Botalwala offer is really good. His offer is still really good
[37:59] if we want to move ahead, then we have to go with the flow
[38:05] Dear, if you call "going with the flow" wisdom, then your father is not wise. Okay?
[38:12] dad look, future is very different. Its changing drastically
[38:16] We have to learn new colors of life, else we'll stay behind. I am telling you
[38:22] Today Botalwala is offering us a good price, but the price will fall tomorrow
[38:25] who will be at loss? You, me, our entire family
[38:31] I cannot be greedy for the sake of profit or loss. Understand?
[38:36] dad... 
[38:39] how shall I explain you?
[38:40] if you want to discuss all this while sitting here, then its better for you to go home. Don't come here. Leave!
[38:52] Faraz, get me some water
