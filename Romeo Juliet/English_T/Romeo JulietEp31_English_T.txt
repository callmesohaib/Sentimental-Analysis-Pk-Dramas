[00:17] because you have never faced such a beautiful exam in your life ever
[00:20] even a great player starts sweating
[00:24]  are you challenging me?
[00:29] challenge is such a small word 
[00:31] you can consider it as your death's well
[00:34] be thankful that you are my brother-in-law 
[00:37] otherwise, I would have told you!
[00:39] Kiran
[00:43]  what happened?
[00:45] what is this, Farhad? 
[00:50] Shahzain, its hurting
[00:51] this pain is nothing, Kiran
[00:54] in front of the pain that your brother gave me
[00:56]  what are you saying, what happened?
[01:40] I'm sorry!
[01:42] you?
[01:43] Its ok
[01:47] Listen... I wanted to say sorry to you
[01:53] that day I had over-reacted a bit too much
[01:56] and what I could have done, it wasn't my fault. You know an alone girl like this..
[02:00] and if someone shall stop an alone girl so.. 
besides, that day you seem to me some loafer type
[02:06] it felt as if you were trying to be frank
[02:13] oh hello! I am talking to you
[02:16] I thought you are saying sorry to me
[02:18] yes, I just did
[02:20] So, there are ifs or buts while saying sorry
[02:23] and the explanation you are giving me
[02:26] what are you trying to say?
it wasn't your mistake?
[02:29] yes, I mean.. No. I mean, every woman thinks before she speaks
[02:35] I live here, and all of my relatives & acquaintances comes here to walk at the same time
[02:42] what they'll be thinking about, whatever you had said to me
[02:47] even nobody will come near me
[02:50] and I accept women are guarded, but you are very weak in character judgment
[02:56] No... and now you are being way too judgmental
[03:00] here I am saying sorry, and you are scolding me
[03:04] as if you are doing some favor on me!
[03:06] You're right
[03:08] my character judgment is very weak
[03:10] Yes!
I am wasting my time for no reason
[03:12] yes
huh!
[03:18] the function was really good
[03:20] all of our relatives were praising a lot
[03:24] that what a beautiful daughter-in-law you've found
[03:29] Greetings!
[03:32] Stay blessed dear, stay happy..
[03:36] are you fine?
[03:39] All praise to God, my daughter seems so pretty
[03:44] All praise to God!
[03:45] Greetingsa aunty!
Greetings, how are you dear?
[03:48] I am absolutely fine, how about you?
[03:50] I am fine
[03:52] by the way, what's the matter aunty. You couldn't even wait for 24 hours & came to meet your daughter
[03:59] as it is, she is so nice
[04:02] that one cannot live without her for a while, right?
[04:05] We have brought the breakfast, as per the tradition
[04:09] her father has prepared it himself in his own kitchen
[04:12] oh aunty! That's why I was thinking that from where I can smell such a scrumptious food
[04:18] Come on, lets have breakfast then
[04:20] No no, we've brought this for you as we are leaving
[04:24] there is no need for any formality now, I am getting it served here
[04:27] oh aunty, you've brought such a good breakfast. I wont' let you go without having it
[04:33] how can we eat anything at our daughter's house?
[04:36] here you go mom, they've made their daughter a stranger in just a single day
[04:40] but your son is here, your own son. And I won't let you go without having breakfast
[04:45] since you are insisting a lot, so lets stay
[04:50] Ok then, lets get it served here
[04:53] by the way, I had thousands of doubts in my heart while wedding off my daughter
[04:58] but now my heart is satisfied that she came to such a loving family
[05:03] oh aunty, don't you worry at all. Nothing will happen to her
[05:06] By the way, I am thinking not to call you aunty from today on wards. I will call you "mom" as well
[05:11] stay blessed
[06:33] hello!
hi!
[06:38] tell me something
[06:40] why did you call me here for the meeting?
[06:42] since we had planned a meeting, and obviously we'll eat something whenever we'll meet
[06:47] and in the entire city, we get the best food at Burns Road
[06:51] No, its not like that
[06:55] I don't like fancy restaurants
[06:58] they serve average food & that too very expensive, useless!
[07:01] also I have an important work with you
[07:03] what?
[07:04] I have heard that the way to a person's heart is through his stomach
[07:09] hey! they say it for men
[07:12] actually, their wives make them fat by making delicious meals
[07:17] and then they are good for nothing
[07:19] as if women doesn't have a stomach? 
They don't feel hungry, or they don't have a heart right?
[07:25] point!
[07:26] hmm... I am such a big foodie. I love to eat delicious food
[07:30] and my mood spoils if I don't get good food
[07:35] this is such a big problem
[07:38] by the way, good food is my weakness too
[07:41] obviously! you've such a big catering business. If you won't be particular then who else will?
[07:48] actually...
the bun kebab guy is here
[07:51] please, come quickly. Its really delicious. Lets eat
[07:54] come
[08:03] here they are
[08:05] eat

I had told you they are so tasty
[08:17] ok tell me how was your sister's event? 
it must be great, right?
[08:22] even Zara was so happy

[08:25] No, there is no need to thanks. Its my work
[08:31] I know. But you are very good at it
[08:34] your business must be flourishing nowadays, right?
Due to big events
[08:38] is this your family business?
[08:41] yes
[08:42] do you always wanted to join your family business?
[08:48] No
[08:51] then what else do you wanted to do?
[08:55] I don't know. There are so many ideas but...
[08:59] that's the problem of this generation. They cannot stay at one place
[09:03] ok granny! but from which generation you are then?
[09:08] hey look...
[09:11] I think, a family business is a blessing
[09:15] its a legacy which your family leaves behind for you
like my family...
[09:20] we are jewelers since ages, the entire family
[09:23] okay?
[09:24] I think, our new generation shall expand it
[09:30] and shall flourish it
[09:32] and shall change it into a new style like changing times
[09:36] I'm sure, your father must be having quite a lot of support from you
[09:44] come, let me make your eat my favorite thing
[09:46] lets go
[09:51] come on
[10:11] do you know something?
[10:14] what happened?
[10:17] where does Freeha stays all day long?
[10:22] this marriage has become such a big trouble!
[10:24] she has got wings, since this drama has started
[10:28] sometimes here or there, or at the market. Strange!
[10:33] huh!
[10:34] I can see, she is flying very high
[10:38] and when young girls gets wings, then we should cut them
[10:43] She will sit at home, once this wedding will be over
[10:48] absolutely not! You'll see. 
She has become habitual of roaming around
[10:53] She will wish to go out everyday
[10:55] where will she go?
[10:56] She is already done with her studies. And she has a few friends, so she'll visit them. What else?
[11:03] what if she'll wish to study further?
[11:06] who will listen to her?
[11:10] dad is here to fulfill all her desires
[11:14] nothing as such will happen. 
Now we have to think about her marriage
[11:19] nothing else!
[11:21] so talk to dad, be strict with her
[11:24] at least stop her for going outside the house, until you guys don't make any decision
[11:30] in our family, the young girls don't roam around outside the house so freely
[11:37] anyways, why do I care? She is your sister, you know better
[11:42] As it is, I am not habitual of interfering in others matters

[13:53] I showed her so many guys in the wedding, but she rejected all
[13:57] She looks at the picture & rejects
[14:00] don't you worry. Do you remember brother Zaman? He is quite serious about Freeha for his son
[14:06] they are such a big family
[14:09] what if she rejects that guy too after looking at his picture, then?

Freeha!
[19:43] Billu, lets go!
Freeha, just two minutes. We can sit & talk

[20:27] yes?
[21:04] what's wrong with you?
[21:06] Nothing
[21:08] will you hide it from me?
[21:10] Billu told me everything
[21:12] I had told you that he is a bad news, he is such a big liar!
[21:17] don't know what more planning he must have done
[21:23] Freeha...
[21:25] what was the need for him to do all this drama, Zara?
[21:28] be thankful that his reality got exposed on the right time
[21:31] you always used to refuse
[21:33] but I had understood the matter from day one
[21:38] Freeha, I know you are different from all
[21:41] you are habitual of going against others decisions
[21:45] you enjoy a lot in testing yours & others limits, right?
[21:50] but we aren't kids anymore, so its better for us to agree with our elders decisions on the right time
[21:56] else we can endure quite a big loss
[21:59] you can consider it as a nature's hint that He has stopped you on the right time
[22:04] tell me honestly
[22:06] are you happy with your elders decision?
[22:09] these elders always took your life's decisions
[22:12] that when you'll study, & how much. When you'll get married & to whom
[22:17] are you happy with all this?
[22:19] don't you feel suffocated by handing over your existence to others?
[22:24] maybe their decisions proved to be wrong, then?
[22:27] I have never thought that much
[22:30] I always found the decisions of my elders right
[22:33] or maybe, I am not confident enough
[22:38] I find it easy to agree with others decisions
[22:44] but you! 
my dear you aren't confident but best example of over confidence
[22:51] Okay! Are you praising or embarrassing me?
[22:56] you may think whatever you want to
[23:00] but please, try to trust others sometimes
[23:06] you have a family
[23:09] they will think good for you
[23:30] Farhad, water?
[23:32] leave it, he doesn't need to drink water instead he likes drinking blood
[23:37] your dearest son has fallen in love
[23:39] ask him yourself
[23:41] even I was thinking that how come he likes coming to the kitchen all of a sudden
[23:45] he is doing something else while sitting there
[23:48] dad, I've been telling you since so long that there isn't any such thing
[23:52] she is just a friend
[23:53] yes dear, she is a friend. 
I didn't get gray hair by staying in the sun
[23:57] we have seen quite a lot of dramas in our age
[24:00] uncle, you too?
[24:03] hey! 
oh brother, what's the harm if the boy has chosen the girl himself?
[24:08] it happens nowadays, and its fine
[24:12] yes, what else? Didn't you see our Nasir?
He got such a beautiful wife
[24:17] also he is very happy with her
[24:19] yes, all praise to God. Also she made him American too
[24:22] put a blindfold on your eyes & push away the manners. End of discussion!
[24:26] you should remove the blindfold from your eyes
[24:28] as if you will protect all the manners or so
[24:32] we have already spent our lives, now its our children time
[24:36] have you forgotten? Even I used to stand & wait in her alley
[24:39] so that I can see her, but she never used to come outside
[24:44] everyone has gone crazy here
[24:46] have some shame, what are you saying?
[24:48] brother, you've been working since you were 15 years. You used to earn very well
[24:53] not like him, who had spent our millions & then he wants a wife too
[24:57] he doesn't have any work or so
[24:59] one needs to be wise to fall in love as well
[25:03] one minute! Did I come to the kitchen as per my own will?
[25:07] you made me come, so I came
[25:09] as if you would have done some brilliant job after that!
[25:14] make your son understand
[25:16] ask him to fix his attitude & become serious about work
[25:20] I cannot feed another person
[25:25] don't feed anyone. I can handle myself
[25:29] Okay? 
I need nothing from you guys
[25:31] Wow son wow! You've become all grown up by eating the food of my kitchen & now you are saying big things
[25:37] thank you so much for feeding us the food & to educate us
[25:41] and to allow us to stay in this house. I am indebted to you
[25:45] do one thing, make a list & write all the amount. I will repay your each & every single penny
[25:50] Farhad...
what else I shall say then?
[25:52] I can never match upto his standards
[25:54] no matter what I do, he never gets happy
[25:59] there is no need to feed anyone, I will feed them myself
[26:03] in fact, let me do one thing. Let me leave this house
[26:05] you will be satisfied then
[26:07] Farhad!
[26:13] you... 
[26:15] you shall also stop it & drink water
[26:18] Quiet!
[26:23] favor your son more... 
[26:26] you did his upbringing, can you see it now?
[26:36] one is stronger than another
[26:40] Bilquis, pass me the pan
[26:42] I'm bringing it
[26:48] you should have told sister-in-law about the kitchen
[26:51] I was telling you before as well
[26:55] I mean... 
Shall I jump off?
[26:58] Shall I cut my nerve or shoot myself?
[27:01] what are you saying?
What are you saying, man!
[27:04] how I could have told her?
[27:06] I should have introduced to these people?
[27:09] you have already seen her family
[27:13] look at them & look at us
[27:15] that's what I am saying, there is a lot of difference between you & them
[27:21] you won, I am a looser
[27:30] I got a degree to sit in the kitchen
[27:36] and when I got my love... 
[27:40] they say it right, one shouldn't see the dreams more than their stature
[27:44] what rubbish you are uttering?
[27:47] its you, who turned my dreams into reality
[27:51] and when it comes to you, you gave up. Wow!
[27:56] brother look, you got this kitchen in heritage
[28:01] its not your destination
[28:03] once you'll understand your destination, then you'll find the way automatically
[28:13] my brother look, don't worry. Everything will be fine with time
[28:22] do you think, Freeha will forgive me?
[28:25] we'll get to know after talking to her
[28:29] come on
[29:26] hello!
[29:27] hello!
hello, Freeha
[29:29] Freeha, thank you so much for attending my call
[29:36] listen, I made a very big mistake
[29:38] its all my mistake
[29:40] I can explain everything, just... 
[29:42] I don't understand how to explain you everything on call
[29:47] can we meet?
[29:51] just meet me once, if you understand my point
[29:54] after then its your decision not to see my face ever again, everything will be done according to you. Please just once
[30:03] Okay
[30:04] what?
[30:05] really?
[30:09] Freeha, thank you so much!
[30:12] I will message you the place & time
[30:18] hello?
[30:44] thank you for coming
[30:48] shall we sit?
No, say whatever you want to
[30:54] I am Farhad
[30:57] Farhad Yaqoob Karim Baksh
[31:00] our kitchen's name is Karim Baksh & Sons
[31:04] my grand father's father had started it
[31:06] our kitchen is quite famous in Karachi
[31:12] Freeha, I don't own any catering business
[31:15] I belong to an ordinary family
[31:18] in fact, I am the first BBA graduate of my family
[31:23] I got this degree after so much of fight
[31:27] this kitchen & all wasn't my dream
[31:30] I got all this in heritage
[31:32] or maybe it was my fate
[31:36] but I... 
[31:38] I want to do a lot more in my life, Freeha
[31:40] I want to get a lot more, and I will
[31:45] this kitchen is the reality of my life
[31:51] its like those chain from which I want to get rid of, but I cannot
[31:56] everyday I think to leave this kitchen somewhere way too far 
[32:00] but there is still time in all that
[32:04] no matter how much run, but you cannot run away from your reality
[32:10] I don't understand, why didn't you tell me all this truly?
[32:14] I was trying to tell you
[32:17] but whenever I tried telling you, I couldn't get the words
[32:24] you, your family... your house
[32:27] everything about you
[32:29] whenever I used to think about all this, I used to think that I am nothing in front of you
[32:34] and what if our every meeting is the last one
[32:38] and this was the fear due to which I couldn't say anything ever
[32:41] See, I know I did a very big mistake. I'm sorry
[32:44] do you remember, what I had said?
[32:46] one needs courage to fall in love with me
[32:49] you don't have the courage to tell the truth, so how will you gather the courage to be with me?
[32:53] this is the only lie I have told you, I swear!
[32:56] I haven't told any lie except for this
[32:59] but whatever I feel for you is true
[33:05] I really love you!
[33:12] a person who cannot love himself, then how can he love me?
[33:16] try to understand my point
[33:18] I'm telling you this is the reality of my life
[33:21] I grew up in the same world where we see people's clothes first before looking at the person!
[33:25] they look at your degree first before looking at your language or manners
[33:29] no matter how great Urdu you speak, but until you don't speak fluent English
[33:32] these big places doesn't open the doors for you
[33:36] Freeha, whether its written Karim Baksh Kitchen or Motivala jewelers
[33:39] but it does make a difference!
[33:44] I got anxious for a while
[33:47] I wasn't going to lie to you for lifetime
[33:50] I am a bit sad on the matter that you haven't told me the truth
[33:54] instead, I feel more sad on the fact that you thought that this difference will make any difference to me!
[34:00] you had become so special to me that I couldn't understand...
[34:05] that why I have become so close to you in such a less meetings
[34:09] but now... I am feeling angry on my foolishness
[34:13] don't say this, Freeha please
[34:16] see, just give me one chance
[34:18] just give me one chance, I am still the same Farhad...
[34:21] No, you are not that Farhad. And whoever this Farhad is, I don't want to know him
[34:27] this is my decision
[34:29] its over!
[35:15] Shahzain
[35:20] Shahzain... please stop it
[35:24] Shahzain, until when you'll stay upset?
[35:28] Shahzain, you leave for the office in the morning & comes back at night
[35:33] and after coming back home, again you leave me alone
[35:35] nobody talks to me for an entire day, I can't bear it anymore
[35:40] please fix your mood
[35:43] Shahzain, until when you'll stay upset on that video related matter?
[35:46]  but that video was taken off from the internet on the same day
[35:48] I hope you must have learnt your lesson
[35:55] what do you think?
[35:57] Did I felt good by doing all this with you?
[35:59] yes?
[36:02] do you know how embarrassing it was for me when my own cousins were showing me the video
[36:07] they say, my in-laws are showing me my right place
[36:10] Shahzain, please forget that matter. We got married with so much of difficulty
[36:16] so?
[36:17] is it my fault? 
No
[36:19] your family always create problems, specially your brother
[36:23] so, both of us together will solve all the problems
[36:27] please don't be angry with me
[36:31] Kiran look, if today on wards Farhad will misbehave with me or my family
[36:37] then its consequences will not be good
[36:38] No, he won't do
[36:42] be thankful that my heart is big that I haven't sent you home that day
[36:57] anyways.. leave this topic
