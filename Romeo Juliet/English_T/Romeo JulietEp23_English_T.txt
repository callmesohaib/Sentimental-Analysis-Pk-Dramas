[00:13] Why should I? Say whatever you want about me, I've been hearing it since I was a child.
[00:19] But I won't wear a word against her.
[00:21] Then get out of here!
[00:26] They picked me up and took me here.
[00:31] Why is it locked. Open this lock! This is my wife.
[00:36] The place we found you..
[00:38] We can't ignore that so easily.
[00:43] Stay at the police station for the night. We'll look at this in the morning.
[02:11] Musa has arranged for a place.
[02:14] It's his cousin's flat.
[02:18] He's shifted to Saudia Arab, and his flat hasn't been sold yet.
[02:23] We can stay there until it's sold.
[02:27] Since he knows us he's not even asking for an advance.
[02:31] Everything will be better.
[02:45] I told you not to expect much from them.
[02:51] They don't care about love.
[03:03] Don't worry, please. I'm here with you and I'll always will.
[03:11] I will never let tears come to your eyes.
[03:14] I will fill your life with happiness. I promise
[03:19] Just give us some time.
[03:22] Trust me.
[03:25] Please.
[03:33] Shall we go now? To our home?
[04:12] Musa was telling me that it had been closed for quite a while.
[04:15] I can see that.
[04:21] Anyways, we'll clean it up and make it all better.
[06:59] Where is Farhad living?
[07:02] He's staying at a friend's flat.
[07:06] It was hard for them to arrange for it. There were so many problems that I can't even mention them.
[07:11] Look at what Farhad has done and father's anger won't cool down.
[07:16] He won't listen to anyone.
[07:18] Ask me how I'm living here.
[07:21] I've even a set time for me to go to the bathroom.
[07:24] I've made a schedule so that he doesn't see me.
[07:29] Tell me one thing...
yes
[07:31] at the last moment you called Farhad and asked him to run away.
[07:34] yes
[07:35] How did you know that he was coming after him?
[07:37] Farhad gave his address and I wanted to meet him.
[07:41] And Shahzain found out and he gave the address to Friya's brother.
[07:46] Why?
[07:47] Why did he do that?
[07:49] What do you mean? He hasn't forgotten his fight with Farhad and after this he has completely turned against him.
[07:56] I don't understand what's gotten into him.
[08:00] Maybe...
[08:05] Maybe I wasn't able to recognize him.
[08:13] Is he treating your properly? Did he say something?
[08:19] Come and check your father's blood pressure, he's not letting me check it.
[08:25] May God have mercy.
[08:26] Auntie, do you want me to come?
[08:28] No, I don't want his blood pressure to increase. Kiran, come.
[08:40] Hamid...
[08:42] how are you, brother Yousuf?
sit down.
[08:49] How come you're here?
[08:51] Brother Yousuf, I went to the shop and saw that you weren't there...
[08:56] that's why I came here to ask of your health.
[08:59] I'm sure you know. Because of Fariya I can't show my face anywhere.
[09:07] Hello... how are you?
[09:09] I'm well...
[09:10] Where's Rashda?
[09:14] Sister is sleeping.
[09:17] Don't disturb her, let her rest. I came here to talk to brother Yousuf.
[09:27] The thing is, brother Yousuf your name has meaning in our community.
[09:31] You've helped a lot of people.
[09:34] You've made a name in your craft, that won't just vanish just because of your daughter's mistake.
[09:42] But it can get stained.
[09:46] Brother Yousuf, the people will talk about it and then forget it in a few days.
[09:50] Who forgets things like this?
[09:53] People don't forget these things. I'm so embarrassed.
[09:58] How will I face people at the shop?
[10:03] Let the boys work for a few days,
[10:08] but one day or another you'll have to come back towards your life.
[10:16] People like you should always stand firm.
[10:21] They are kids and they all have to come home one day.
[10:26] The doors to this house is closed for her forever.
[10:33] I admit it's very hard, but brother Yousuf I will say one thing...
[10:40] This time heals all wounds, no matter how big they are.
[10:45] Give it some time, everything will be alright.
[10:50] That's what I came here to tell you.
[10:56] One more thing, people like me still say your name with respect.
[11:07] Thank you very much. It feels nice to hear this.
Of course.
[11:14] Here you are.
Thank you.
[11:26] After a long time I've seen brother Yousuf smile like that.
[11:32] It seems that your words...
[11:37] has eased the burden on his heart.
[11:41] I don't have kids, so I can't understand the weight of his pain.
[11:46] Tell me one thing...
[11:51] Why do parents take their children mistake so personally?
[11:55] Hamid, this is not a small mistake.
[11:59] You are right, but Fariya is the one who made the mistake. She's the one who needs to pick up the weight.
[12:06] There should be no need for you and brother Yousuf to hide your faces from the world.
[12:12] He earned this respect all his life,
[12:16] it can't just go away so cheaply.
[12:19] That doesn't happen,
[12:22] but it seems that...
[12:26] you should come here daily.
[12:30] And you should meet brother Yousuf...
[12:32] and speak similar things to him. Because if you do...
[12:40] then maybe he'll come out of this depression.
[12:43] I don't mind at all, this way I'll get to meet you daily.
[12:49] What do you want to do by meeting me daily?
[12:52] You'll know that soon enough.
[12:58] Alright then, I'll get going.
[14:15] You're up...
What is all this?
[14:22] Nothing, I couldn't sleep at night so I decided...
[14:25] to clean the flat a little bit.
A little bit?
[14:29] You cleaned everything. I didn't hear anything. Where is all the stuff?
[14:37] I didn't know that you were such a deep sleeper.
[14:41] I thought the the noise would disturb you...
[14:44] but you didn't even move...
[14:49] Alright, don't worry.
[14:52] These sofas are fine. We'll get new fabrics, have them polished and they'll be good as new.
[14:59] We can put the TV over there.
[15:04] And... we'll get a new carpets... and this entire place will pop up.
[15:11] It's not like I haven't thought about the bedroom...
[15:17] We'll get a bed... two side tables
[15:22] and a dressing table. It will be all good then.
[15:30] Don't you like it?
[15:33] You did all of this alone, for me?
[15:47] Friya...
[15:50] I know that you deserve more than this...
[15:55] I can't give you much right now...
[15:59] but I'm trying to keep you comfortable here.
[16:03] I'll set this all gradually... promise.
[16:09] We'll make this our home Farhad, together.
[16:16] I'm sorry...
[16:19] I've put a lot of burden on you, right?
[16:24] You're not a burden, you are my responsibility.
[16:30] You are my life.
[16:42] Do you have a problem?
[16:43] What are you saying?
[16:46] Don't you fancy my Gujrati?
[16:49] No you are too good...
[16:51] now come on... feed me the breakfast you've made me.
[16:56] Come on.
[17:08] I don't see father anywhere. Saqib asked me to give this to him.
[17:13] He's gone out with Hamid.
[17:19] What are you doing?
[17:21] The plastic tore off, so I'm replacing it.
[17:27] I find something around this house to distract myself.
[17:35] I miss Friya very much.
[17:42] Stop missing her.
[17:45] People have stopped meeting us.
[17:49] You were so social before. It was so distracting for you.
[17:57] And father has been meeting Hamid quite a lot lately.
[18:01] There are a few people who meet us respectfully now.
[18:07] It's good that he spends time with Hamid nowadays...
[18:13] It keeps him distracted.
[18:17] He forgets his pain.
[18:20] They will be good friends.
[18:23] Yes for him and aunt Shaggo as well.
[18:28] Shaggo?
[18:30] Don't you know? Aunt Shaggo is good friends with Hamid.
[18:35] They meet in the park everyday.
[18:37] Didn't you see how aunt Shaggo puts on her joggers and leaves at five in the evening?
[18:44] Shaggo has always gone on her walks.
[18:48] There's hop in her step now.
[18:52] She applies lipstick before she goes, before that she only took her scarf before she left.
[19:00] But now she make special preparations.
[19:06] It's good. Aunt Shaggo has found herself a distraction.
[19:11] All hell broke loose on our house.
[19:14] People are still watching us...
[19:17] Aunt Shaggo should be careful,
[19:20] we don't want to give the people the opportunity to talk.
[19:27] People already say, like aunt, like niece.
[19:32] Mother you are very naive.
[19:35] You should keep an eye on what's going on in your house.
[19:39] I'm saying this for your well being, otherwise you know I stay out of people's business.
[19:48] Where are the AC remotes, let's replace the plastic for them as well.
[19:53] It's good you can't find them. If you can't find the remotes, you can't turn on the ACs.
[19:58] Besides the electricity is getting expensive, the bill is too much.
[20:02] You guys should turn it on less.
[20:04] And not at all from 5:30 to 10:30, it's peak hours.
[20:15] That deflected on me. I'll have to sit in the heat now.
[20:21] Do what mother is asking you to do. Give her the jewelry.
[20:27] Don't you hear me? Give her the jewelry!
[21:05] Kiran hurry up, it's my cousin's wedding, he won't like it if we're late.
[21:09] I'm coming...
[21:14] Shall we?
Wait a second...
[21:20] Where did you get this from?
My parents gave it to me.
[21:27] Alright... this girl is such a fool.
[21:31] You know how things are nowadays, what if someone steals it?
I'll hide it.
[21:38] No, we can't take any chance. Give it to me.
[21:41] I'll keep it inside.
[21:44] She doesn't trust your mother, it's not like it has diamonds encrusted on it.
[21:49] In our family girls hand their jewelry to their mother-in-law the very first day.
[21:54] And look at her, she's so clever hiding like it.
[21:57] It's my belonging...
[22:01] Who does it belong to?
[22:05] From tomorrow she won't sit on the sofa...
[22:08] because it belongs to us.
[22:14] Shahzain I didn't mean that...
[22:15] I buy the ration as well, so she won't be eating as well...
[22:19] Once she stays hungry for a few days she'll stop talking back.
[22:24] Do as mother says, give her the jewelry.
[22:30] Don't you hear me? Give her the jewelry!
[22:46] It's so light, I wonder why she was acting so possessive.
[22:52] I'll keep this away... and I'll get something for her neck.
[23:02] Do you see...
[23:04] how much she cares for you. Why do you do this?
[23:18] Hurry up mother.
[23:25] This is what you call a set, and it matches as well.
[23:29] Take off these earring and wear these matching ones.
[23:34] Hurry up, we're getting late!
[23:49] These are how sets are supposed to be.
[23:55] Why are you standing idly, wear them and come out.
[23:59] Mom, I am waiting outside
[24:01] Come on wear them now!
[24:14] What are you doing?
[24:18] I'm correcting my CVs, once I get some leads, I'll apply for a job.
[24:24] You'll find a job quickly.
[24:27] If only the one conducting the interview has the same confidence in me.
[24:45] Shall we have something tasty for breakfast today?
[24:48] Sure.
[24:50] Really?
[24:54] Yeah sure...
Really...
[25:00] Then go ahead!
[25:05] Where?
To make breakfast.
[25:11] Me?
[25:12] Who else then?
[25:13] I thought you would make it.
[25:17] I make it daily...
[25:20] Putting butter on toast isn't making breakfast.
[25:26] I make the tea as well.
[25:33] Then make me a delicious omelet as well.
[25:36] A delicious omelet?
[25:38] I don't know how to make an omelet.
[25:42] Then what can you make?
[25:46] Make me halwa puri!
[25:50] Am I cookbook?
[25:55] What do you mean?
[25:56] Where will I learn to make halwa puri?
[25:59] You had a catering business, right?
[26:02] My father did, not me.
[26:05] So what? You grew up around food, you must have learned something.
[26:11] What does that mean? If you like eating so much...
[26:16] do you know how to cook?
[26:17] Why?
I like to eat, not to cook.
[26:21] Sure...
[26:23] Farhad, I'm starving. I've become toast eating this toast!
[26:28] Please... please... make me an omelet.
[26:35] How hard can it be?
[26:41] Come on... let's try...
Go ahead!
[26:49] What?
Come on miss.
[26:53] Where?
I can't make it alone.
[26:56] We'll make it together.
I won't... you can make it alone!
[27:08] Hit it with a spoon and open it up.
[27:32] Do one thing...
[27:34] Chop the vegetables, I'll take a look at it...
[28:36] Greetings Hamid, you're here?
How are you brother?
[28:39] I'm well, sit down.
[28:41] We were supposed to head out late, right? The market won't be open right now.
[28:45] I came early...
Everything alright?
[28:50] I want to talk to you about something important.
Sure, what is it?
[28:55] Brother Yousuf you know I don't have any elders...
[28:59] And... my family isn't here, so I came to talk to you.
[29:03] What are you saying, we're your family.
[29:07] Say whatever you want.
[29:10] Thank you. You have encouraged me by saying this.
[29:15] If I have your permission, I would like to marry your sister Shaggo.
[29:24] Marry Shaggo...
[29:26] Do you mind?
[29:30] No...
[29:33] Did you talk to Shaggo about this?
[29:37] How could I have without talking to you first? We'll proceed how you like it.
[29:48] I...
[29:51] can't believe it. I didn't expect Shaggo to get a proposal under the circumstances.
[29:58] I'll talk to Shaggo, don't worry.
Sure...
[30:06] Greetings.
We have a proposal for Shaggo.
[30:11] A proposal?
Yes.
[30:13] For Shaggo?
[30:18] What is this shamelessness?
[30:20] What's the shame?
[30:23] It's shameless to marry at such an age.
[30:29] When will you sister stop embarrassing us? 
[30:33] All her life she kept filling our daughter's ears.
[30:36] Because of her our daughter is away from us.
[30:40] Because of her?
[30:43] You have a veil over your eyes as well.
[30:49] Have some mercy on us.
[30:52] We are already become a joke in our community.
[30:57] We couldn't marry off our daughter, so we'll marry off Shaggo.
[31:02]  I don't know what's happening in our home!
[31:08] I should get going.
Sit down Hamid.
[31:11] You two should talk, I'll get going.
[31:14] Alright, farewell.
[31:23] I can't hear anymore. Reject this proposal right away.
[31:32] I would be grateful if you do.
[32:01] Farhad!
[32:12] Move your legs Farhad!
[32:32] You're there...
Where else?
[32:38] Weren't you here just now?
[32:40] No... I was out preparing for my interview.
[32:44] Are you joking?
[32:46] What's the matter?
[33:26] Brother... brother...
[33:28] Brother, get up..
[33:30] Get up...
What happened sister? What's the noise?
[33:33] There are rats in our house.
So what?
[33:39] Take them out...
[33:40] What do you mean? They live here.
[33:42] What do you mean by that?
What I mean to say is that...
[33:45] there are a lot of rats around here. They even bite the ears in the back alley, 
[33:48] but these ones don't say anything.
[33:50] Don't worry... go to sleep.
[33:53] I won't go upstairs. You take a bill for the maintenance, right?
[33:58] Get up and go to work. Remove those rats from our house!
[34:02] Do you give the electricity bill?
Of course we do.
[34:04] Is there any electricity, no. You give the water bill, is there any water bill? No.
[34:11] You pay the gas bill, but is there any gas? 
[34:14] No. We take money from you for maintenance...
[34:17] Don't you dare complete your sentence, otherwise Farhad will gather all the rats and throw them on you!
[34:22] What are you saying?
[34:24] Farhad, he won't listen to us if we're polite. Get up and remove those rats!
[34:31] It's not my job. I'm sure your place is dirty and they were attracted to the smell.
[34:37] How dare he say that? Have you seen the filth around your building?
[34:42] There are piles of trash! I'm sure they smelled that.
[34:49] Friya, wait a minute! We're new here, please come up.
[34:55] Why are you saying please? This is his job and he's shying away from it.
[35:00] It's not my job to remove rats.
[35:02] That's what I'm trying to tell you. You can rat traps in the morning.
[35:09] Farhad, I won't sleep upstairs with rats.
[35:13] As you wish, I can't do anything...
Friya... he's right...
[35:21] You're taking his side.
I'm not!
[35:25] What should we do now?
[35:27] Did you hear what he say? It makes no difference to him...
[35:32] How can rats and people live together, these people are so uneducated...
[35:40] Are you guys news here?
[35:44] You are the ones who create noise and we are uneducated?
[35:50] Auntie mind your business. please... 
[35:53] This is my business, I'm the manager of the building.
[35:57] People vote for me.
[36:01] Who do you think I am?
I can see how much you've worked.
[36:04] If you don't like it, then you can do it.
[36:08] Auntie, do you know how much work there is in your building. 
[36:11] How many rats there are! Farhad, let me talk!
[36:18] Will you look at rats?
[36:20] I'm not your auntie, should I get you a room in Buckingham palace?
[36:24] Seems like she is Sultan Rai's niece!
[36:49] What happened?
[36:51] Nothing, go to sleep... it's just a glass of water.
[37:00] It's nothing.
[37:04] I've spent my entire life with you, but your snores...
[37:08] are still the same.
I've never heard it. Give me your hand...
[37:13] Once I go to sleep, you can take it away.
[37:18] The entire world can burn, whilst you only care about yourself.
[37:24] I have to hand it to you. Go to sleep!
[37:44] Go... check if everything's clear.
You come as well.
[37:47] First you go.
[37:50] Fariya, it's only a rat... not a dinosaur. Go ahead!
[38:00] Keep the broom upwards.
[38:22] Come here!
[38:28] Farhad!
[38:31] Farhad!
[38:47] What happened?
[38:50] Everything is clear.
[38:53] Everything is clear.
Show me the body.
[38:59] Everything is clear, right?
[39:01] Yes... it is... I've closed the doors and windows as well.
[39:05] Nothing will be coming in now.
[39:07] Farhad, this is all because of you.
[39:13] What do you mean? Did I call them here by playing a flute?
[39:17] Have you seen the kitchen? It's so dirty...
[39:22] Hello... I throw my trash...
[39:26] So... who will wash the pans... you can clean them...
[39:32] I should cook and throw the trash as well. How's that fair?
[39:35] Farhad please, don't talk to me like you make Chinese for me everyday.
[39:41] You make lentils and eggs that's it!
[39:46] And it's not like I don't know how to do anything.
[39:49] I'm telling you off?
[39:55] Fariya, I have a job interview tomorrow. I need to sleep.
[40:00] This is enough for today, shall we?
[40:04] I've check it a million times... there's nothing there.
[40:08] I can't sleep there.
[40:11] Stay here... I'll go.
Farhad!
