[00:20] How many kgs?

[00:33] got it? 
[00:35] got it? 
yes!
[00:42] see, just give me one chance 
[00:44] just give me one chance, I am still the same Farhad... 
[00:46] No, you are not that Farhad. And whoever this Farhad is, I don't want to know him
[00:52] this is my decision
[00:55]  its over!
[01:15] Shaggo! 
yes sister? 
[01:18] a guy is coming to see Freeha guy! 
[01:20] a guy is coming! 
When?
[01:22] right now
[01:24] right now!
[01:26] Ask her to get ready & come downstairs, the guests are here
[01:30] sister, how can we present her in front of anyone just like that
[01:34] you know Freeha's nature very well. She'll get upset
[01:38] let her be
[01:40] if we will tell her then she'll vanish somewhere by making an excuse
[01:44] sister..
and yes! don't brain wash her about anything
[01:49] sister, why will I brain wash her?
[01:52] I was just saying this so that she doesn't make any spectacle in front of the guests
[01:57] that's why I am saying, there is no need to tell her anything
[02:01] get her ready & bring her downstairs. Rest I will handle
[02:04] Ok
[02:09] did you see? She always talk about creating obstacles
[02:31] Freeha
[02:34] Freeha...
[02:38] they are calling you downstairs
[02:40] the guests are here, go meet them
[02:43] who is it? I don't want to meet anyone right now
[02:46] I don't know. Go, ask your mom
[02:53] aunt Shaggo, your Gujarti mode is on. Means something is fishy
[02:58] I don't get it, what's the problem?
[03:00] as I said, go ask your mom
[03:04] She had just asked me to bring you downstairs
[03:07] I will be thankful to you, if you can please go downstairs
[03:11] do you get it now?
[03:12] Okay, chill!
[03:16] what have you done to your room?
[03:20] aunt Shaggo, I am not liking this vibe
[03:24] you'll get to know about the vibes
[03:27] it will be a total disaster!
[03:35] isn't your husband home?
[03:37] actually...
[03:41] Greetings!
[03:43] Greetings! How are you?
[03:46] fine?
[03:48] dear, come sit
[03:53] All praise to God, she has become all grown up & pretty
[03:56] Last, I saw her in her childhood
yes
[03:59] dear, serve tea to aunt & Sarmad
[04:05] lets call someone from inside to serve the tea
[04:10] hey, why will the servants do this?
[04:13] in our family, all house chores are done by the women
[04:16] great!
[04:18] call dad
[04:21] actually he is not at home
[04:24] he was so upset that he won't be able to reach on time
[04:30] also he had said that he wants the complete report
[04:41] she is habitual of joking, our house is always lively because of her
[04:47] yes, daughters are the liveliness of one's house
[04:52] please take something.
Freeha, serve her the tea
[04:56] hey no, Sarmad doesn't drink tea. These kids love coffee
[05:04] Freeha knows how to prepare a very nice coffee, she'll bring it right away
[05:08] I was thinking, what if the children shall go for some coffee nearby
[05:14] this way they'll be able to have some conversation
[05:23] but...
[05:25] it won't be appropriate
[05:29] mom, we know Sarmad & his family since so long. She'll be back within half an hour
[05:35] the time has changed
[05:38] all of this has become quite necessary nowadays
[05:41] Besides, we don't want to give anyone a chance to complaint
[05:46] yes yes, even we aren't that old school
[05:49] You guys are our family, if we won't trust you then on whom else we will?
[05:53] true that
[05:54] after all, these children have to make the final decision
[06:04] yes yes, you are right
[06:16] Freeha go
[06:22] go, you just have to go nearby. You'll be back within half an hour
[06:33] please come
[06:35] come...
[06:43] please do visit our home
[06:45] are you set now?
[06:47] not at all, brother
[06:50] I've done everything, played carom & Foosball too
[06:53] also I drank 5 cups of tea
[06:56] but nothing is effecting
[06:59] my heart is still upset, brother
[07:01] at least you are trying, we are trying it together
[07:05] everything will be alright, brother. It happens slowly & gradually
[07:09] its a heart matter, so it will take some time
[07:12] but you are in such a hurry
[07:13] we don't have a magic wand, that once we use it & it will create a magic and everything will be fixed
[07:18] it will take some time. Now look at me, even my girl had dumped me
[07:22] now see, I am enjoying my life & everything is set
[07:26] you think too much, that's your only problem
[07:30] anyways, leave all this. Go straight, let me treat with a great dessert. Come
[07:36] come on my brother, go straight
[07:41] where are you going?
[07:45] where are you turning? Oh hello! we have to go straight
[07:49] Farhad!
[08:01] how will you move on if you'll do like this?
[08:03] I don't want to move on!
[08:05] she must be upset too
[08:08] I just wanted to see her once
[08:12] poor girl must have been in a bad condition while crying continuously
[09:03] but she seems quite fit!
[09:07] lets go, come on
[09:10] what are you doing!
[09:14] is the AC fine?
[09:16] yes, its fine
[09:19] let me play some music
[09:20] actually, dad had recently gifted me this car as a birthday gift. So I am still figuring it out
[09:26] No, that's ok. Its fine without music
[09:29] really?
[09:30] Okay... as you wish
[10:00] maybe he is her cousin brother
[10:10] give me a balloon
[10:16] cousin brother, right?
[10:19] maybe he likes balloons
[10:22] for you
[10:28] thank you!
[10:44] somebody shall learn from her, how to move on!
[10:47] by the way, the guy seems classy
[10:51] but my brother has a separate class
[10:55] lets go, what's the use of it? 
Lets go
[10:58] come on
[11:29] hey brother! Where are you going?
[11:32] I want to talk to her
[11:33] are you mad! What will you say to her?
[11:35] I don't know, but I want to talk to her
[11:37] brother, you are not in your senses the matter will be ruined
[11:41] forget her!
is the matter under control now?
[11:46] Farhad!
[11:51] this Rolex feels quite heavy sometimes
[11:54] it hurts the wrist
[11:57] what would you like to drink?
cappuccino or latte?
[12:00] I don't like coffee, but you may order whichever you like
[12:04] oh really? I love coffee
[12:07] I have placed a machine in my house as well
[12:09] then you should have drank it at home, what was the need to waste your money here?
[12:16] You have a good sense of humor
[12:20] I can't see the waiter
[12:23] I think, you need to place an order over there
[12:27] in that case, let me order my choice of coffee for you
[12:31] you wouldn't have tasted such a coffee ever, I am sure you'll change your mind
[12:35] I can take my own decision
[12:37] relax! Its just coffee
[13:01] Farhad! you here?
[13:08] you are doing an absolutely correct thing
[13:12] I don't know why I came here
[13:17] maybe...
[13:20] I came to tell you that
[13:22] he is hundred percent better than me
[13:27] you are doing the right thing
[13:29] who are you? Why are you getting free with her?
[13:33] I see, by seeing an alone girl you are trying to do flirt with her
[13:38] look at his attire...
[13:40] they let so cheap people enter here
[13:42] hey! get lost from here else I will break your jaw!
[13:46] hey!
[13:48] how dare you to raise your hand on him?
[13:51] and what do you think of yourself!
[13:54] is this some way to behave with someone?
[13:56] how dare you!
[13:58] do you know him?
[14:01] you have insulted me for such a lowly guy!
[14:03] let me tell you...
[14:07] hey you! don't even think of it
[14:12] else, I will bury you right away
[14:15] you don't know me yet, I will see you later
[14:18] you don't know me!
[14:31] he forgot his belongings here, let me go give him
[14:37] what was this for?
[14:38] because you deserve it!
[14:41] lets go now!
[14:42] but where?
to drop me home, where else?
[14:52] Farhad, stop the bike
[14:54] what?
[14:54] I said, stop the bike
[14:57] Farhad, I said stop the bike
[14:59] stop it
[15:01] but what happened?
[15:04] Freeha?
[15:06] Freeha, where are you going?
[15:08] Freeha?
[15:10] Freeha, where are you going?
[15:12] at least listen to me. Freeha.
Freeha?
[15:16] what's your problem?
[15:18] what?
[15:18] what is your problem? You have made me go crazy!
[15:23] I don't know how to speak in Gujrati language
[15:24] but you've made me so crazy that I don't know how am I am speaking it
[15:29] everything is getting upside down since you've come
[15:31] what do you think of yourself, tell me!
[15:33] I completely hate it when others make my life's decisions
[15:37] who gave you the right?
[15:39] you thought it yourself that I will love some cheap, showoff Rolex guy & I cannot love some caterer?
[15:45] you've thought it yourself! 
Who are you to decide it?
[15:49] Freeha, I was just...
Shut up! Quiet
[15:52] only I have the right to make my life's decisions, got it?
[16:02] so whom do you love?
[16:05] I love you, you idiot!
[16:07] I love you, Farhad!
[16:14] shall we lock it then?
[16:17] not over? Ok?
[16:22] what if you'll lie to me again then?
[16:24] I know what you can do
[16:26] next time, I won't create any trouble. Promise!
[16:31] sorry!
[16:38] Fine, then quickly take me home
[16:40] as of yet the matter would have spread on the Memon hot line that Freeha Motivala has slapped someone
[16:46] Wow, Motivala!
[16:47] by the way, do you know I had never thought that I will be flattered by a girl's slap
[16:52] Great!
[16:56] lets go home
[18:05] So then?
[18:09] so what?
[18:20] aunty.. 
yes?
[18:23] did you get today's arrangement done from the same guys, who had arranged the dance party?
[18:26] No, what's wrong? Do I have to ruin my daughter's wedding?
[18:31] I will not come in this every time
[18:35] brother Saqib I... 
Quiet!
[18:38] not a single word!
[18:58] why you guys had sent me with such kind of a guy?
[19:02] do you know, he was such a violent & ill-mannered guy
[19:06] I was so afraid
[19:09] you got afraid?
[19:11] but his mother said that you had misbehaved, you had slapped him
[19:15] so, didn't she tell you that why I had slapped him?
[19:17] you must have misbehaved with him for sure
[19:20] Fine! You can say that to me. But I must say, call him & ask
[19:24] that why I had slapped him, and what was he doing there
[19:27] He started beating everyone like a hooligan
[19:30] I met a friend, & he just causally said "hi"
[19:33] he started coming towards me after beating & fighting with everyone
[19:37] I was so scared, dad
[19:38] what! 
yes
[19:40] I was so scared
was this your choice for me?
[19:45] but they were saying something else
[19:50] obviously dad, they'll accuse the girl
[19:53] dad, I was so scared. Also I never wanted to go with him, but all of them had forced me
[20:02] we know them since so long
[20:05] a person doesn't carry a character certificate with themselves
[20:10] what was the need? They should have called us home & refused
[20:14] dad, they were insisting a lot so we thought...
[20:18] what you had thought?
I had told you that they'll meet at the wedding
[20:23] and everything will be fixed there & then
[20:25] then why you did this?
[20:27] brother, sister thought of giving her some choices
[20:31] as she is so picky
[20:34] apparently they seem to be good people
[20:37] how we would have known that..
[20:38] whatever, next time it shouldn't happen. Got it?
[20:41] go my dear
[20:42] lets go Freeha, its enough for today. Come on
[20:45] I knew it already, that it will be a total disaster
[21:09] wow! it smells so good
[21:11] yes...
[21:13] what are you cooking?
[21:14] my Kiran's favorite, Korma (chicken curry)
[21:17] she is coming
[21:18] oh, Kiran is coming over? Great!
[21:21] do you know, I haven't met her since so long
[21:24] she has vanished since she got married
[21:27] she doesn't even answer my messages properly
[21:30] let her come, I will fix her
[21:32] No, there is no need to
[21:36] now that's her house & her family
[21:39] let your sister settle down
[21:42] what do you mean? 
has she broken off her ties with us?
[21:45] No... she didn't but it has changed now
[22:07] Farhad, what do you do!
[22:10] what?
[22:11] You have magic in your hands, wow!
[22:15] you've made such a nice rice pudding
[22:16] that's true, but why my son is so happy?
[22:21] isn't that matter true? that girl related
[22:28] what?
[22:31] actually... 
Kiran is here
[22:35] let me open the door
[22:37] Farhad
[22:39] Can you try not to argue with your father today?
[22:42] don't argue, Kiran will be worried
[22:46] my condition always get bad whenever I see you both arguing
[22:49] can you please try for you mom?
[22:54] promise?
[22:55] yes yes, promise
[22:58] yes Greeting! To whom do you want to meet?
[23:01] don't talk rubbish!
[23:02] forgive us, we don't have money
[23:03] Farhad...
[23:04] Okay, so you remember my name. I thought you don't remember my name
[23:09] I agree that you're married now, but do I have any relation with you or not?
[23:13] I was quite busy, that's it!
[23:15] yes yes...
 Greetings Shahzain! How are you?
[23:18] I will pick you in the evening
[23:20] see you, bye!
bye!
[23:26] what happened to him?
[23:28] nothing, brother.. 
[23:31] Kiran, is everything fine?
[23:32] he is upset with you
[23:34] with me? Why!
[23:36] upon that video matter, he saw that video
[23:39] is he a kid?
[23:41] I mean, such things do happen between the guys. He should get over with it
[23:45] Farhad, Shahzain is correct
[23:48] just imagine, how insulting it must be for him that even his cousins saw the video
[23:55] oh, then he shall talk to me. Won't he speak to me for life time?
[23:59] and we'll keep fighting like this forever?
[24:01] listen to me Farhad, at least you shouldn't retaliate. Ok?
[24:06] in fact, don't answer back to Shahzain for anything. Also, I must say... 
[24:10] don't come infront of him until he forgets everything
[24:12] I mean, I don't want any problem to happen
[24:20] Kiran
[24:22] is everything fine?
[24:25] I hope he doesn't takes out my anger on you
[24:28] obviously! there isn't any such thing, Farhad
[24:32] I am just saying that there shouldn't be any problem in the future
[24:38] Kiran, don't lie to me
[24:41] is everything fine?
[24:42] there is no problem, what problem there can be?
[24:45] that's why I'm saying that there shall not be any problem in the future
[24:48] what else can be the matter?
[24:52] Kiran
[24:54] Greetings mom!
Greetings! Where is Shahzain?
[24:58] He had to go to the office
[25:00] So he should have left after drinking tea

[25:57] I know, you'll be the prettiest girl in the entire wedding 
[26:02] really? Just in the wedding?
[26:04] No... I didn't mean to say that
[26:09] of the entire world
[26:10] I was saying the wedding just like that
[26:15] Ok listen, there is no need to stare Memon guys at the wedding tomorrow. Got it?
[26:21] really! everyone has made a line for me of Memon guys
[26:24] so, I have to look at someone for sure
[26:27] and then what's the use of getting so much dolled-up. When I can't see someone & the other person cannot see me
[26:32] No no, nobody will look at you. Not at all!

[34:26] No dad...

[35:33] you were my honor. 
Tomorrow I won't be upset if I will loose my wealth but.. 
[35:40] I won't be able to tolerate my insult
[35:46] Today, I will wed off Zara proudly for her sake
[35:50] but... the reality is that you've made my head down with shame
[35:58] dad
[36:00] give me a chance to explain once

oh God!
[37:01] how?
[37:05] I want to talk to her
I want to speak to Freeha

I want to talk to Freeha
[37:11] don't know in what condition she must be!
[37:17] I am telling you, I will cut the hands of those whoever touched her!
[37:20] haven't you gone mad? Come back to your senses!
[37:23] why are you creating trouble for her?
[37:27] and be thankful to God that you've come back in one piece
[37:30] what else I shall do? Shall I sit here idly?
[37:32] think calmly! think calmly sometime
[37:36] you are angry, also the other party is angry. Everything will be ruined
[37:42] listen to me, let me talk to them
[37:45] I will ask them to beat me as much as they want to, but don't say anything to Freeha. Let me talk to them once please
[37:49] nothing will happen, she is their daughter
[37:52] they won't beat their daughter like this
[37:55] try to understand
