[00:13] what rubbish you are uttering?
[00:15] what are you saying? Have you gone mad? Are you crazy!
[00:18] I am absolutely fine. I wish you had fix your dearest daughter's mind on the right time
[00:23] how is this possible, Saqib? She must be somewhere in the house, go find her
[00:28] what happened?
 Who did this?
[00:30] such a bad scene has happened
[00:32] her brother came in the gym, with so many goons
[00:38] they have ruined my entire gym
[00:40] I am asking the question here
[00:43] where is Farhad?
[00:45] how dare you to enter my house?
[00:47] hey!
[00:50] be thankful that I came here alone, the police didn't come
[01:27] when did you wake up?
[01:28] I haven't slept
[01:30] why?
[01:32] I couldn't sleep while thinking that today you'll become Mrs. Farhad
[01:39] and I will become Mr. Freeha
[01:49] hello!
[01:50] Farhad, listen to me! Get out of there, run away from there immediately!
[01:55] what happened, Kiran?
[01:56] I don't have time to tell you anything right now. Freeha's brother has got to know your address. Leave that place as soon as possible
[02:19] Farhad, what happened?
[02:23] Freeha, they are here
[02:25] come on, lets go!
[03:04] Farhad... 
[03:06] open the door
[03:30] Freeha, why are you crying?
[03:33] I am with you
[03:35] open the door!
open it
[03:59] look over there
[04:28] brother, they are fleeing away
[04:34] hey stop!
[05:30] King of the braves, Lion of the Lord, Strength of the God, There is no one like Ali, There is no sword like. Zulfiqar
[05:40] my man is great among all noblemen
[05:44] who never run away from the battle, who is a symbol of courage and invincibility
[05:48] this is the shrine of the follower of that courageous noblemen
[05:52] the oppressor gets protection by the noblemen over here
[05:56] then how come the enemy dare to harm that person by any means
[06:02] well... 
[06:04] may you get peace
[06:06] my child, cover your head
[06:11] its a respectable place
[06:15] singing religious verses*
[10:30] what happen, did you get any update?
[10:32] they fled away just in front of my eyes
[10:34] so, didn't you stop them?
[10:35] they've made me crazy, they are making me run in the entire city
[10:38] I was about to catch then but they got slipped by an inch
[10:40] brother Saqib, talk to the DIG
[10:46] give it here, disconnect it
[10:48] whatever spectacle had to be made, its done
[10:51] now there is no need to call the police & get us more humiliated, got it?
[10:54] dad, they must be in the same area right now. We can bring them before the wedding nuptials
[10:57] what's the point of calling the person back home, who doesn't wants to come back?
[11:01] so, what about our respect?
[11:02] our respect is already ruined! its over
[11:05] leave her!
[11:07] I used to think, once she'll go then she will be afraid
[11:10] she will come back after getting afraid. She'll get hold on herself once we'll call her
[11:13] why shall we wander around after her in all the streets?
Enough is enough now!
[11:17] so dad, shall we let them go so easily?
[11:18] what do you mean by this?
It was my mistake that I used to think, who am I to stop her?
[11:23] or to say, go...
[11:25] she doesn't have any respect for you, for your mother or for me. We are nobody to her!
[11:32] Call them. Let me inform everyone that no wedding is going to happen today
[11:36] end of discussion!
[11:37] dad, don't do this. The police will catch them, I am telling you
[11:41] what respect will be left of ours if the police will handover our daughter to us?
[11:46] she has ruined our honor
[11:49] whatever will be amiss will be completed after calling the police
[11:52] let her go
[11:55] dad is right
[11:57] you also consider her dead for us
[12:13] Freeha, daughter of Yousaf Motivala. Do you agree to marry Farhad son of Yaqoob Karim Baksh with alimony of 50,000 rupees?
[12:24] I agree
[12:27] do you agree to marry?
[12:30] I agree
[12:32] do you agree to marry?
[12:41] I agree
[12:43] Farhad son of Yaqoob Karim Baksh, do you agree to marry Freeha, daughter of Yousaf Motivala?
[12:51] I agree
[12:54] do you agree to marry?
[13:02] I agree
[13:04] do you agree to marry?
[13:07] I agree
[13:23] has everyone got to know?
[13:26] yes, dad has told everyone
[13:29] he does whatever he wants to do at everyplace!
[13:35] his daughter is also like him
[13:38] everyone does whatever they want to do in this house, except for you
[13:41] look at your condition
[13:44] what not do we have to tolerate because of this father daughter duo, have you ever thought of it?
[13:48] the entire community knows
[13:52] my mom was saying, if any girl in our family would have done any such thing then they would have killed her with their own hands
[13:58] even I feel like doing the same, when I saw her today
[14:04] remember, everyone talks big in this house
[14:08] but everyone melts like a wax after coming in front of Freeha
[14:11] don't know what magic this girl has done
[14:14] see, there is no need to compare me with everyone. Got it?
[14:16] I have never favored such silly antics
[14:19] you could never stop her as well
[14:21] what difference does it make now?
[14:23] now we have to hide our face because of her
[14:49] your brother has proved to be so clever
[14:51] he even fled away from that Motivala as well
[14:53] what is wrong with you, Shahzain?
[14:57] I am unable to recognize you
[15:01] a guy who never used to talk loudly with me before marriage, now he yells & screams at every other matter. Why?
[15:09] you mean to say that you have no fault in all this?
[15:14] what?
[15:15] what? What! tell me
[15:17] what have I done?
tell me
[15:21] you are punishing me in yours & Farhad's fight
[15:24] tell me yourself
[15:26] think with a cool mind, is this matter so big that no matter what even our relation shall be compromised?
[15:31] our relation shall get ruined?
[15:33] from where the initiative was taken, Shahzain?
[15:37] where have I took an initiative?
[15:40] my family had tried to fulfill every desire & demand... 
one second... 
[15:45] what did you say?
[15:47] they had fulfilled every demand?
[15:49] the demand related to car
[15:54] you had said that you'll talk to your parents
[15:58] or actually it was your demand?
[16:04] you did everything for dowry!
[16:05] there is no need to do so much of drama in front of me, understand?
[16:10] and you guys have become crazy after listening to feminist rights! nothing else
[16:15] every parent of this world gives gifts before marriage for the sake of their daughter's happiness
[16:19] what's the big deal in it?
[16:22] as far as the household items are concerned, is it just mine?
[16:26] don't you use it? tell me
[16:28] you use them, right?
[16:29] we'll have our family in the future, so will I take you to the doctor on the bike in this scorching heat?
[16:35] as far as the car is concerned
[16:37] who will use it?
 Our kids will use it
[16:41] true?
[16:43] Ok
[16:47] if your car demand is fulfilled
[16:52] will your behavior become fine?
[16:55] will you forget yours & Farhad's fight?
[16:59] yes?
[17:00] Kiran, do one thing
[17:04] you can try
[17:07] bring the car once, you'll get to know
[19:40] Sorry, Freeha
[19:44] I know this place is not capable for you
[19:47] everything happened so quickly, that I didn't get a chance for any better arrangements
[19:59] will your dad agree?
[20:02] will he call us back home?
[20:06] maybe...
[20:11] I don't know
[20:15] but don't you worry
[20:19] if not there, then I will arrange some better place for you
[20:22] I won't keep you here for long, Ok?
[20:28] I am feeling hungry
[20:31] oh! Let me bring your favorite fry kebabs?
[20:34] but don't go alone, I will come along with you. I cannot stay here alone
[20:39] you are tired, rest for a while. I will quickly go & come back. Sit
[20:44] in fact, lock this door
[20:47] close it
[21:11] move away!
[21:12] Yaqoob, don't take the pot
[21:15] oh God!
you'll see what I will do to him with the pot
[21:18] the kid's head will split open
stand straight!
[21:20] oh!
[21:32] you have helped him in eloping the girl, right?
[21:34] you were with him, you wretched!
[21:36] get out of this house, don't enter again else I will break your legs
[21:38] uncle, at least listen to me for once
[21:41] he got saved once again
[21:43] stand straight!
[21:46] wait a minute
[21:48] mom!... mom
[21:50] oh God what is it!
[21:51] move away!
[21:53] Yaqoob, don't take the pot
[21:56] oh God!
you'll see what I will do to him with the pot
[21:58] the kid's head will split open
 stand straight!
[22:00] stand straight
oh Yaqoob!
[22:03] I will lock you in the same pot, if you'll throw anything on my son
[22:07] sister, what are you saying? Do you know what he did?
[22:11] He helped my son in eloping a girl
[22:13] so, what else he could have done? After all, he is his brother
[22:16] my son's blood hasn't gone white like yours
[22:19] brother, what's wrong? You are favoring him!
[22:21] I am trying to put sense in your mind
[22:26] have some sense. What's done is done, Yaqoob!
[22:29] now if you'll stand in front of the kids like a cruel society, then the kids will do whatever they are doing right now
[22:36] you can loose your only son, but you cannot leave your ego
[22:40] don't listen to anything
[22:41] brother, I don't want to listen to anything
[22:43] means, you are trying to say that our children shall become disobedient
[22:48] they shall not listen to us, they shall elope the girls from our neighbors & we shouldn't say anything to them. Right?
[22:53] if you had hugged him since childhood, then you didn't had to see this day
[22:58] hey, your son would have been your friend at this age
[23:01] but you! you have enmity against him
[23:03] I don't want to hear anything
[23:05] tell him to go away from my sight
[23:07] Yaqoob, you really like to make people go away from you. Then do it!
[23:11] but listen to me very carefully
[23:14] this house is mine as well, my son is not going anywhere from here
[23:20] don't come in front of me, else...
[23:25] aunty, mom... please hide these pots
[23:28] uncle will break my head
[23:30] Jojo, nothing happens. You won't get hurt or so
[23:33] listen, go to Farhad's place & tell him to come back home
[23:37] its not a good thing to wander around in the streets with someone else's daughter
[23:42] he shall come home & apologize to Yaqoob
[23:45] no matter if he touches his feet. Because now its his responsibility to keep the relations intact
[23:51] got it, dear?
[23:54] very good!
[24:28] Sharmila
[24:35] who is it?
[24:36] its me, Sharmila
[24:54] Sharmila...
[24:59] hey Sharmila, are you opening the door or...
[25:03] Sharmila
[25:44] Farhad! you're back
[25:47] what are you doing?
[25:49] somebody was trying to enter forcefully
[25:53] just a while ago
[25:54] who?
[25:55] I don't know
[25:57] but nobody is here except for me
[25:58] Freeha, a person calls out before throwing a vase. Right?
[26:03] and this antic vase must be of almost one & a half kg
[26:06] if I would have got injured then you would have become a widow today
[26:11] I am feeling like a heart attack
[26:14] come here
[26:15] move...
[26:18] I was so afraid
[26:24] so you thought of taking his life in one go!
[26:27] no...
[26:29] Wow! I am feeling scared now
[26:33] if I will come late at home, then will I be welcomes with lamps, vases or pots?
[26:39] what's wrong? Why are you being so dramatic? After all, you got saved
[26:43] you didn't get hurt anywhere, right?
[26:48] what is all this that you've brought?
[26:56] this is for you
[27:04] and I got late, because I was buying clothes for you
[27:09] see
[27:12] so sweet!
[27:14] wow!

[27:18] oh yes! this is your food. Here is your tikka
[27:24] these are your kebabs, & flat breads. Have them now!
[27:28] wow!

[27:39] Umm... have a look
[28:01] you are the dessert to my malpura!
[28:05] from where you've brought such a sweet romance?
[28:09] here, I am bringing food for you & you are making fun of me
[28:12] No no, absolutely not!
[28:17] do you want a bite?
[28:19] let me give you a morsel

I will
[28:23] so much of love...
[28:26] you eat...
Okay
[28:29] what are you feeding me?
[28:52] Brother Yousuf
[28:57] Brother Yousuf, I want to talk to you about something
[29:01] go ahead
[29:04] I want to apologize to you, Brother Yousuf
[29:18] it feels, the pain I have given you is never ending
[29:33] I...
[29:36] haven't I put any false hopes in Freeha's mind?
[29:45] Brother Yousuf, believe me
[29:51] I have always tried to explain her, not to become like me
[30:00] she shall not become like me
[30:04] I had never brain washed her to become rebellious, brother
[30:08] never
[30:12] and now, whatever discussion is going on in the entire community
[30:20] that if you had made Shaggo an example, then your daughter wouldn't have crossed this line
[30:28] please forgive me, Brother Yousuf
[30:34] I should have left from here long time ago
[30:38] I should have...
[30:43] No...
[30:47] have you gone mad?
[30:50] there is a lot of difference in her mistake & your mistake
[30:55] its quite different
[30:58] that's what I was explaining Freeha
[31:02] don't be crazy, you have no fault in it
[31:05] you have to make yourself strong!
[31:11] we'll be humiliated a lot, we'll be insulted too much
[31:16] but...
[31:19] you have to stay strong, ok?
This stain is only mine & Rashida's
[31:26] we've been defeated.
[31:30] I'm sorry that you people are also getting affected, but what to do
[31:36] I cannot see you in this condition
[31:45] please go
[31:47] dear, go & rest. Its quite late night, I am also tired
[31:51] I want to be alone, please go
[31:53] Brother Yousuf
[31:55] you are the best brother in this world
[32:02] you have always supported us
[32:06] let them humiliate us
[32:10] let them stain us
[32:14] but we are standing with you until our last breath
[32:21] please go
[32:25] you have to be strong, very strong!

[34:10] did his anger cooled down?
[34:14] we'll get to know after going there
[34:17] he has beaten up Jojo with every other thing, such as shoes & sandals
[34:20] lets see now what he beats me up with
[34:28] listen, don't you worry
[34:30] we'll present you if somebody will say anything
[34:33] what if they beat me, then?
[34:35] No, why will they beat you?
[34:37] everyone is not violent like your brother, that they start beating whomsoever they get
[34:40] don't go on my family!
[34:42] hey hey...
[34:45] you are so possessive about your family as of yet
[34:48] that you are showing tantrums to your husband
[34:49] so, what's the use of bringing the families in between like a typical husband & wife?
[34:55] ok sorry, I have said it by mistake
[34:58] actually the wounds given by your family are still fresh
[35:05] is it fine now? it is?
oh sorry, sorry!
[35:09] sorry! what do you do?
[35:12] go get ready, we have to leave
[35:16] will they like me?
[35:19] why they won't like you?
[35:20] it would be great if dad likes me, but anyways we'll be okay if he likes you
[35:27] now go, get ready
[36:06] you've finished the jogging quite early today
[36:10] I'm tired today
[36:15] Hamid, you shouldn't be sitting here
[36:21] why?
[36:23] but I always sit here
[36:25] that's why, you shouldn't sit
[36:29] but why?
[36:32] Hamid... people will make so many gossips
[36:37] which people?
[36:40] do you know these people?
[36:43] a lot of people from our community comes here for a walk
[36:49] and all of them are looking at us, right?
Everyone is talking about us?
[36:53] there is a possibility that they like your dress
[37:00] Hamid, I recognize these looks very well
[37:06] and right now, everyone is talking about our family
[37:15] you don't even know
[37:21] we've been through a lot of crisis
[37:24] actually... I know
[37:30] see
[37:32] the entire world goes to sleep
[37:35] but this Memon Hotline never sleeps
[37:43] by the way...
[37:46] you should have asked me about it
[37:51] since its your personal matter, that's why
[37:56] I had sent a message to brother Yousuf, that if he needs any help then he shall let me know
[38:04] really?
[38:07] Shaggo, right now everyone will call to enjoy
[38:14] right now the first stone will be thrown by a person, who had never committed any sin ever
[38:19] Shaggo, everyone has some imperfection
[38:22] there is an issue in every house
[38:25] look at Mrs. Rauf
[38:30] yes, this one. Her husband beats her on daily basis
[38:35] and that Mrs. Chawla. Her daughter has come back home & its been a year now
[38:40] and she tells people as if she came yesterday
[38:43] and they don't get tired while discussing others daughters
[38:47] God shall ask them
[38:51] shall I give you a suggestion from my heart?
[38:54] don't take the words of such people to your heart
[39:01] Shaggo
[39:04] do let me know, if I can be a help for you, or brother Yousuf or for your family
[39:13] brother Yousuf's status is quite high in our community
[39:20] Mrs. Chawla
[39:23] is everything fine, sister?
is your daughter fine?
[39:28] Okay, pay my regards to her
[39:35] I used to consider you very brave, but you got anxious by such people
[39:40] I don't get anxious by anyone so easily!
[39:44] but what to do in this situation.
[39:53] Farhad
[40:05] thank God that you are fine
[40:14] lets go
