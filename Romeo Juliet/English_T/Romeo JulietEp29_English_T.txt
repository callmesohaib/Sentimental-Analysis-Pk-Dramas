[00:14] if we will tell her then she'll vanish somewhere by making an excuse
[00:18] sister.. 
and yes! don't brain wash her about anything 
[00:23] sister, why will I brain wash her?
[00:32] he forgot his belongings here, let me go give him
[00:36] what if you'll lie to me again then? 
[00:38] I know what you can do 
[00:40] next time, I won't create any trouble. Promise!
[00:43] aunty.. 
yes? 
[00:45] did you get today's arrangement done from the same guys, who had arranged the dance party?
[00:49] No, what's wrong? Do I have to ruin my daughter's wedding?
[00:54]  I will not come in this every time
[00:58] brother Saqib I... 
Quiet! 
[01:01] not a single word!
[01:21] sorry, it took me so long but I have arranged a shoe
[01:25] really? Thank God!
[01:31] I was so worried
[01:35] what is this?
[01:36] shoe
[01:38] its a bathroom slipper
[01:40] actually I could only found this in the hotel, as I couldn't go to the market to get you some fancy one
[01:46] wear it, as its hardly visible
[01:49] yes
[01:50] your work is done, also its comfortable
[01:53] yes yes
[01:54] you must be thankful that your sandal broke, right?
[01:58] true that! Its quite comfortable
[02:07] your blood...
it stopped
[02:11] Okay
[02:12] I am leaving
[02:15] are you leaving now?
[02:18] Umm...
[02:22] I am leaving
Ok
[04:13] Saqib
[04:17] yes dad
[04:20] see, there had been a spectacle there so there is no need to repeat it in front of the family once again
[04:28] won't you still not say anything to Freeha?
[04:30] I will talk to her, and the matter won't stay hidden from our family
[04:35] but I don't have that much tolerance power right now
[04:39] leave this matter for today
[04:41] we'll see it later
[04:58] I knew it, dad won't say anything to her
[05:02] I feel like thrashing her off!
[05:06] if somebody from our family would have done this, then we would have buried them alive!
[05:12] Dad has become completely crazy in his daughter's love
[05:16] he has become crazy, but you haven't!
[05:19] neither shameless
[05:20] Shall we also put a blind fold on our eyes & become dumb as if nothing had happened!
[05:25] I must say, control this girl & get her married as soon as possible
[05:30] so that she cannot do any new drama in the future
[05:33] break her contact from the outside world
[05:36] this phone is the bone of contention!
[05:39] let dad say whatever he wants to, but at least you shall scold her clearly!
[06:01] Farhad
[06:03] Freeha, are you fine?
[06:10] Freeha, don't you worry
[06:12] I will come to your house & talk to your family. I will handle everything
[06:15] are you fine?
[06:17] are you hurt?
[06:18] nothing happened to me, don't worry about me
[06:21] only trust me
[06:26] we'll handle this situation mutually
[06:28] we'll agree our families too
[06:32] Farhad, we cannot handle anything...
[06:44] hello?
[06:46] listen! if you ever call here again
[06:51] then I won't let you go
[06:54] I will kill you!
[06:57] I will kill you!
[07:07] shameless...
[07:10] aren't you done yet?
[07:12] how much more you'll get us insulted in our extended family?
[07:18] if you took a step outside this room
[07:21] I will break off your legs!
[07:25] we'll make the decision tomorrow & that too in front of everyone
[07:29] you will get married to the person & family of our choice
[07:34] got it?
[07:35] do you understand?
[08:07] burn your degrees
[08:09] put them on fire
[08:11] you show if off quite a lot that you've got a degree
[08:15] when you have to act like a hooligan on the street, right!
[08:18] and have to wander around, then what's the benefit of these degrees?
[08:22] at least tell me for what you are taking revenge from me?
[08:26] look at your condition!
[08:31] stop it
[08:34] I beg in front of you, please spare our old age
[08:37] we are living on bonus, anything can happen to us at anytime
[08:42] I don't understand who will look after my business after my demise
[08:45] for God sake, please don't talk about death or so Yaqoob
[08:49] can't you see, he is in pain
[08:51] So? did I injured him?
[08:54] its been an entire life time, I took good care of him
[08:57] I swear upon God, he won't be able to to sit the say he'll get injured from my hands
[09:02] brother look, I have grown so tired now
[09:05] some of my life is left, please become a bit sober
[09:12] dad, I'm sorry
[09:16] what! what did you say?
[09:24] dad, forgive me
[09:26] what?
[09:29] please check, I think he got some head injury
[09:34] uncle, he is saying sorry for the first time in his life & that too from the bottom of his heart
[09:37] yes boot licker, as if you are sitting in his heart
[09:41] dad, I wanted to become serious in my life
[09:46] I want to settle down
[09:49] dad, I had lied to you on that day
[09:53] about what?
[09:57] actually...
[10:01] the girl who came to our kitchen on that day
[10:05] Freeha
[10:08] she is not only my friend
[10:16] dad, we both like each other
[10:23] we want to get married
[10:25] hmm...
[10:27] dad, I will sit in your kitchen every morning
[10:30] I will do so much of hard work, I will do whatever you'll say
[10:34] and what do you want from me in return?
[10:40] please take my proposal to her house
[10:44] Great!
[10:47] you also smile
[10:50] the way sun rises from the west, now I've understood
[10:55] he didn't get injured by any accident or so, he got beaten up due to his love story
[11:01] her brothers have beaten him badly
[11:05] I am amazed...
[11:09] I have no interest in your love story, got it?
[11:15] dad please
[11:16] Enough!
[11:21] relations aren't made like this
[12:11] what was amiss in my upbringing?
[12:14] in my love?
[12:16] dad, there is nothing like that
[12:20] people always used to say to me, not to give so much of freedom to your daughter
[12:25] I used to say "No"
[12:27] I never used to listen to them
[12:30] by saying that my daughter is my pride, and she has never given me a chance to complain
[12:39] right?
[12:44] you broke my heart
[12:51] I so sorry, I never wanted to hurt you
[12:56] its my mistake, I should have told you earlier. I am so sorry
[13:10] listen to me
[13:12] promise me
[13:15] that you will never meet that guy again
[13:22] promise me
[13:32] enough of your childish attitude
[13:34] I've tolerated enough of your tantrums
[13:37] only that will happen whatever I will say, got it?
[14:07] stop it sister, how much more you'll cry?
[14:11] this girl has written crying in our fate
[14:17] don't say this, sister
[14:19] she is a child, and children do make mistakes
[14:21] mistake! She got all of us humiliated
[14:25] if any girl would have done any such thing in our family, then we would have disinherit her!
[14:30] everyone was so proud of their dearest girl, now bear it!
[14:35] we'll make her understand
[14:37] what will you make her understand?
[14:38] if you would have explained her earlier, then we didn't had to face this day
[14:42] I will ask dad to talk to Zaman & fix the marriage immediately
[14:46] will Freeha agree?
[14:48] the decision is not in her hand anymore
[14:58] stop crying dear...
[15:02] what have you done, Freeha?
[15:06] I had told you not to
[15:08] I had always explained you
[15:11] no matter what you do, but never make a mistake of falling in love
[15:16] I haven't done it deliberately, Aunt Shaggo
[15:20] such mistakes happened unintentionally, my dear
[15:25] he is such a nice guy
[15:28] he loves me a lot & cares a lot for me
[15:32] he will keep me happy, & I won't be able to live without him, aunty
[15:37] control yourself, Freeha
[15:40] your heart is broken from the very first time
[15:44] the pain of incomplete love is felt so intensely
[15:50] why can't I get my love?
[15:54] its not necessary that every man outside our community is wrong
[15:57] you'll get my marriage fixed in my community as well
[15:59] maybe that breaks off, what's the guarantee?
[16:02] try to understand my point, dear.
[16:05] Brother Yousaf took such a big stand for me at that time
[16:14] and when we got deceived
[16:16] he was told off from the entire community
[16:19] he took the humiliation & insult of my share on his head
[16:24] but he won't be able to do it again
[16:27] maybe it doesn't happen again
[16:30] and I get my love
[16:33] maybe I will be able to see all that happiness in my life that you have dreamed of
[16:38] then? Will he take a stand for me then? or won't he?
[16:42] its not so easy
[16:45] nothing matches with that guy, not even our community
[16:52] love has its own place
[16:54] but marriage is not between only two people but between two families
[17:00] they are hard working people
[17:02] they are honorable, the guy is well-educated. He loves me
[17:06] isn't all this have any importance in front of our community & status?
[17:10] its easy to get married
[17:13] but its very difficult to fulfill it
[17:16] as if you had fulfilled it
[17:19] even you had lost the courage once it was called off
[17:22] I thought, if I will talk to you then you'll understand my point & will explain it to everyone
[17:31] yes
[17:35] I couldn't fulfill my marriage
[17:38] but I have fulfilled my relations
[17:41] of a daughter
[17:43] of a sister
[17:46] of a sister-in-law
[17:49] of an aunt
[17:52] I've seen all these relations from very near
[17:59] every relation requires hard work
[18:04] and the way these relations look so helpless while looking at them
[18:09] they are way too delicate than that
[18:15] relations don't work upon emotions
[18:19] they work upon tolerance & compromise
[18:26] and you don't know how to do it
[18:45] I can understand your pain
[18:47] believe me, I can
[18:51] I have been through all this
[18:55] that's why I am saying
[18:58] be careful
[19:01] be careful...
[19:38] hello Farhad
hello Kiran!
[19:40] Kiran, I need your help
[19:43] what is it, all good?
[19:49] I want to get married
[19:51] what?
[19:53] what do you want to do?
[19:54] what as such strange thing I have said that everyone is so amazed?
[19:57] I am done with graduation & this is the age to get married, no?
[20:01] I mean to say Farhad, who is the girl?
[20:04] how is her family? Did you talk to mom & dad?
[20:08] girl's name is Freeha, she is from a Memon family
[20:11] they are jewelers
[20:13] She is the best girl in this world & I will die without her, Kiran
[20:17] honestly, I will die
[20:18] Ok
and yes, I had a word with dad
[20:20] but you know, maybe he likes to strangle my desires to death
[20:25] Kiran, please come & help me
[20:27] I will talk to them
[20:29] I will call you back, ok?
I will come & discuss it there, bye!
[20:37] who was it?
[20:40] it was my mom, she was a bit worried & missing me. So I was thinking to meet her for sometime
[20:49] don't you feel fine at my house?
[20:52] its not like that Shahzain, mom sounds a bit worried so I wanted to visit her
[20:58] the house where there is a stupid son like Farhad, so its obvious that worries will be there
[21:06] ok fine, you may go
[21:12] thank you!
listen
[21:14] yes
[21:15] come quickly
[21:16] there is no need to spend the entire day there
[21:20] ok
[21:32] dad
[21:33] I am not asking from you, but telling you
[21:37] that I have fixed your marriage with Sameer, brother Zaman's son
[21:44] but dad...
Enough! leave...
[21:50] thank you, thank you!... 
[22:13] did you call me?
[22:16] sit down
[22:29] this was the reason
[22:32] I used to tell you that a girl should get married at an early age
[22:37] otherwise they get mislead
[22:39] that hooligan boy, an ordinary caterer
[22:45] look at his courage
[22:50] and you!
[22:51] you didn't have some sense?
[22:54] you came into the words of such kind of a person
[22:57] you didn't even think a bit that what will people say!
[23:01] people will not live my life
[23:04] that's why I want to live my life according to my own choice
[23:07] is this your choice?
[23:09] that licentious, hooligan guy!
[23:11] he is not like that..
be quiet!
[23:14] we showed you many good proposals, but you have rejected all
[23:18] as if you were in search of some prince charming
[23:22] and whom do you like, he?
[23:24] do you want to hurt your parents deliberately?
[23:28] or...
[23:30] do you want to follow Shaggo's footsteps?
[23:34] what aunt Shaggo did?
[23:37] She had just expressed her choice
[23:40] and at that time, you people had supported her
[23:43] so why can't you support me now?
[23:47] did you see?
[23:48] did you see!
[23:51] this is what I used to tell you that Shaggo will give negative impact on the girls, but you didn't listen to me at all
[23:56] nothing had happened because of her
[23:58] you've seen the consequences of her choice, right?
[24:01] She did whatever she wanted to
[24:03] and then he belonged to a good family background. It was a nice family, he was a banker
[24:08] what difference did it make? He had deceived as well
[24:11] this is what I am trying to explain you
[24:15] that marriage shall always happen in our own community
[24:21] as we know about each other
[24:23] we do know each other's background
[24:26] but you are unable to understand this thing right now
[24:28] what do I want, doesn't that make any difference?
[24:32] you can unite community, status & background. But if there is no union of heart then the relation will always stay hollow
[24:38] you should be ashamed!
[24:40] you are talking rubbish in front of your parents, about love or so...
[24:44] we didn't had any union of our hearts before our marriage
[24:47] we had never thought of discussing about such matters in front of our elders
[24:52] and don't talk about such non-sense & foolish things
[24:57] Love, etc.. always happened after marriage. Not before marriage!
[25:01] what if it didn't happen? Then do you allow me to leave my husband?
[25:05] did you hear?
[25:08] stop it, Freeha
[25:11] I agree that we have given you too much of independence, but don't take undue advantage of it
[25:17] you were given complete right to choose the husband of your choice
[25:23] but... there are a few limitations which we cannot accept
[25:32] I used to consider you so wise
[25:38] but now I see, and look at your decisions
[25:42] I feel as if I was completely stupid!
[25:45] dad
[25:46] I am not asking from you, but telling you
[25:50] that I have fixed your marriage with Sameer, brother Zaman's son
[25:57] but dad...
[25:58] Enough! leave...
[26:12] Kiran
[26:15] what happen, where have you sent Kiran?
[26:18] yes?
[26:22] dad, your favorite snacks & tea
[26:27] what do you do dear? You've entered the kitchen after coming here as well
[26:30] dad, it feels so different in my parent's house kitchen
[26:34] Okay
[26:40] check this uncle, I had gone to Burns Road. 
Then I thought of bringing your favorite rice pudding
[26:46] is everything fine? Haven't you mixed anything in it?
[26:49] you can try, you'll get to know
[26:53] oh God, save me
[27:03] is everything fine?
[27:07] can you see horns on my head?
[27:10] dad, actually we were trying to say that if
[27:16] we can listen to Farhad in a peaceful manner, then what's the harm in it
[27:22] I see... so there is bribe behind snacks & rice pudding
[27:27] no uncle, you do so much for us so we thought to lessen a bit of your burden
[27:33] dad, honestly speaking.. I've never seen Farhad in this manner
[27:37] and whatever Jojo & Farhad are telling, I think the girl is really good. She is the best one
[27:41] I must say, that stupid Farhad will have one responsibility
[27:45] yes uncle, its a big family
[27:48] she is an honorable girl, and well-educated
[27:51] its just that she belongs to a Memon community
[27:56] Memon?
[27:57] yes so what, if she is Memon? It doesn't make any difference though
[28:01] how can we marry Memon with an Urdu speaking?
[28:04] when a Punjabi & Urdu speaking can get married, then what's the problem in marrying a Memon girl?
[28:11] Karim Baksh's sons have big heart
[28:16] they make everyone just like them
[28:19] now look at her, I've taught her to make such a great paan that you won't be able to find such kind of a paan in whole Karachi
[28:29] the way this Punjabi woman makes it from her hand & feed me
[28:33] I swear, I feel so good
[28:38] He is done! He appreciated her a bit & she fed him the paan
[28:41] hmm... even you had added her dish of "Cholay Baturay" in your kitchen, right?
[28:48] so what's the harm in adding "Khowsuey" too?
[28:50] when foods have united, then obviously the hearts will unite too
[28:56] yes?
[28:58] this race & community related things are old-fashioned
[29:03] now the generation is of tik-tok
[29:05] they fix their relations based upon meet hours
[29:09] got it?
[29:11] on what?
[29:12] on meet hours.
what's that?
[29:15] its very important to change yourself with time. So important!
[29:20] the elders shall be happy wherever their kids are happy
[29:25] Kiran is right! Even we used to wander around in the streets like hooligans, correct?
[29:32] but we had fixed ourselves soon after the marriage
[29:37] correct?
[29:38] aunty, also look at the fact that a girl will come in our family & she'll beautify the entire house
[29:43] look at Farhad's condition, we cannot say anything about him
[29:46] also, since he got into this love affair. He has become a completely useless guy
[29:50] bring a daughter-in-law, she'll keep your house beautiful
[29:54] I swear upon God, Freeha will change Farhad's life
[29:58] I can write it down somewhere for you
[30:00] by the way Yaqoob, even the kids as well as brother is saying the same thing
[30:05] there is no harm in meeting them
[30:08] also our Farhad's age is of marrying
[30:11] we can also see his choice
[30:14] only you were left now
[30:17] dad...
[30:19] please dad, meet them once
[30:24] we'll see
[30:33] we'll see ..
[30:34] No, I was asking about the rice pudding
[30:39] he has brought it for me & you want to have it
[30:42] Its for you, Yaqoob
so? I will eat it
[30:47] mom
[30:52] mom
[30:56] Greetings mom!
Greetings!
[30:59] where is your wife?
[31:01] she has gone to her parents house, where else?
[31:04] wow! she is enjoying a lot
[31:07] by the way, you've broken your promise
[31:10] what's wrong, mom?
[31:12] why? Didn't you said that once your daughter-in-law will come to this house, you'll get a big car
[31:16] but we are still using rickshaws & taxis on daily basis
[31:18] and your wife doesn't stays at home, how will I make her serve me?
[31:22] oh mom, not only one car but you'll get tens of them
[31:26] and he will bring it herself
[31:28] leave it, I think you got trapped in her love
[31:32] oh mom, there is nothing as such. And everything that belongs to Yaqoob uncle will be mine in the future
[31:38] Why? Doesn't he have his own son?
[31:41] he knows it very well that how stupid his son is, and I will remind him again & again
[31:46] just don't worry
[31:48] everything will happen as per your planning
[31:52] ok?
[31:54] I pray it happens in that way
[31:57] come, freshen up. Let me serve the dinner
[31:59] let me go change, I am so hungry
[32:05] dad, mom...
[32:09] I wanted to talk to you about something
[32:16] I'm so sorry
[32:21] I am really sorry
[32:28] I have hurt you both a lot
[32:35] I'm really sorry
[32:39] I...
[32:45] I had tried to make myself understand for so long that..
[32:50] whatever decision you both are making for me
[32:54] only that is right for me
[33:00] but...
[33:05] I am unable to do it
[33:11] I have tried explaining it to myself a lot, but dad
[33:15] my heart isn't agreeing
[33:20] I don't understand getting married to a stranger guy
[33:24] however, I know that there is someone else in my heart except for my husband
[33:31] I can betray myself
[33:34] for the sake of you people
[33:37] but how can I betray someone else?
[33:40] dad
[33:42] you know, I cannot do this
[33:45] I am your daughter
[33:50] you guys don't like my choice. Fine, no problem!
[33:56] but I cannot accept this decision of yours
[34:05] I cannot do this contractual marriage
[34:10] you guys don't want me to Meet Farhad, right?
[34:13] Fine!
[34:15] I won't meet him
[34:19] but I cannot marry someone else as well
[34:22] what rubbish you are talking?
[34:29] did you see?
[34:31] did you see, what she has just said?
[34:35] Will she keep sitting for that guy for her entire life
[34:38] the way Shaggo had been sitting
[34:43] its all Shaggo's brain washing
[34:46] Enough! I cannot tolerate it anymore
[34:50] enough is enough!
Rashida...
[34:52] Rashida, listen
[35:08] your dialed number is powered off, please try again later
[35:23] what happened?
[35:27] speak up, what happened?
[35:29] uncle has agreed!
[35:33] what?
[35:34] uncle has agreed, brother. You are about to become a groom, you are getting married
[35:39] brother, we'll be doing the wedding processions. Oh brother, uncle has agreed!
[35:44] has he agreed in real?
[35:45] yes!
[35:48] even after you've mentioned that she is a Memon?
[35:50] look, don't play with me
[35:53] Kiran, is he telling the truth?
[35:54] Excuse me! I say anything & dad refuses it, Not possible!
[35:58] oh wow, the benefits of being his favorite child
[36:01] thank you, its not about being his favorite. Actually I didn't gave him a chance to complain ever
[36:04] thank you so much!
[36:10] thank you to you too!
[36:14] send it quickly to me over there
[36:17] hey!
[36:24] thank you, thank you!
[37:30] dad, shall I share one thing with you?
[37:36] do you know, whenever people had said that Freeha is stubborn
[37:39] she does whatever she wants to
[37:41] She says whatever comes in her heart, & do whatever she wants to
[37:47] I always used to feel happy
[37:50] in fact, I used to feel proud
[37:53] because no matter how I am
[37:57] I am my father's daughter
[38:03] when uncle had drowned his share of inheritance, he was left with nothing
[38:08] people called him broke
[38:10] everyone suggested you, not to take this burden on yourself
[38:14] but you said "No"
[38:15] he is my brother, my bloodline.. whether he has the money or not
[38:22] we don't turn away our face from our family
[38:24] the same way, when aunt Shaggo had expressed her choice
[38:27] then you had supported her all alone after going against everyone's consent
[38:32] you became her protective shield although her decision was proved to be wrong
[38:38] everyone tried to oust her from our community, but you didn't let it happened
[38:43] you didn't let her face any harm or so
[38:49] dad, all my life I've seen you becoming the voice of weak people
[38:54] I've learn from you that we shall not differentiate between people
[38:58] I am your image
[39:02] so I cannot be bad
[39:06] Fine, I agree that I had made so many mistakes but still I cannot be bad
[39:15] dad
[39:17] please
[39:19] just once
[39:22] please meet Farhad once, just for me
[39:26] just meet Farhad once, please dad. Look here
[39:31] please
[39:33] please dad
[39:35] I agree that he is a catering guy
[39:38] but I also know your heart as well, you'll recognize his intentions
[39:42] you will also see those qualities that I've seen in Farhad
[39:46] please dad, just listen to me for once
[39:49] after that, whatever you'll say I will agree. But just once
[39:55] please give one chance to Farhad, please meet him once
[40:08] please
