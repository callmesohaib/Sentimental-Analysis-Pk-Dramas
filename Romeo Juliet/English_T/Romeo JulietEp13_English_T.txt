[00:13] you are my only son
[00:18] will you turn away your face from your responsibilities?
[00:21] Farhad
[00:23]  you have to take this responsibility
[00:27] you have to handle the catering business now. Yes! 
[00:31] Kiran, dad never trusted me
[00:36] he had announced his decision by transferring this catering business to your name
[00:39] just because you've got the property so you've got a long tongue now
[00:44] but I have to teach you a lesson 
[00:48] I have to teach you a lesson... 
Shahzain
[01:00] why are you staring now? 
[01:03] why are you staring!
[01:05]  I am the owner of this company
[01:09] and who are you! You don't even worth two bits 
[01:13] what is your worth?
[01:24] this is my worth!
[01:38] Irfan!
[01:40] go, call the guards
[01:43] call the police, I will fire him from my company right away
[01:49] bring water, hurry up!
Sir, please sit
[01:52] Sir... 
[01:55] Sir, don't create a spectacle. Everyone has made a video
[02:00] what if it goes against you?
His father had passed away
[02:05] Video?
how weird it will look that an ordinary employee is beating his boss
[02:09] are you getting my point?
[02:11] who made the video?
[02:13] Sir, everyone made the video
[02:19] keep it here
Shaggo
[02:21] yes
[02:22] I am looking for you in the entire house & you are here
[02:25] dear, keep it here & then you may go
[02:28] I thought to do a bit of setting
[02:32] even I had thought to do some setting of my house, but I didn't get any time
[02:37] Its okay, I have done this work of yours
[02:43] Shaggo.. 
[02:46] I think, this house was waiting for you
[02:50] really!
[02:54] are these cushion covers new?
[03:00] I don't know, actually there were a few cushions & bed sheets in the big cupboard of the big room
[03:07] So I have removed the old cushion covers to wash them & did the setting by putting up the new ones
[03:14] by the way, people say it right
[03:16] a house needs a woman, which makes it a home
[03:22] Shaggo
[03:25] I am so fortunate
[03:28] better late, but I got you
[03:32] Hamid
[03:36] I am also very lucky to get your companionship 
[03:44] Right now, I am recalling a poem with a lot of intensity
[03:50] if you allow me, can I say it?
[03:52] won't you tell me if I will say no?
[03:54] still I will say it
[03:57] then tell me
[03:59] I only have one complaint from my life
[04:04] Wow!
[04:05] Please continue
[04:07] okay.. please continue
[04:08] I only have one complaint from my life
[04:11] Wow!
[04:13] I got you way too late
[04:17] didn't I tell you correctly?
[04:20] No no, its good. Very nice!
[04:25] Hamid, you are very nice
[04:29] and specially whatever you did for Fariha
[04:36] for that, I cannot thank you
[04:40] but still, thank you!
[04:44] actually I.. 
[04:51] Shaggo, what happened?
[04:59] I thought.. 
[05:04] yesterday, Fariha had visited after so many days
[05:08] and the ice between father & daughter must have melted
[05:16] but... 
[05:19] talking to her is a different matter
[05:24] brother Yousuf didn't even looked at her
[05:32] Shaggo, don't worry
[05:35] everything will be fine between brother Yousuf & Fariha
[05:40] now see, she came to our house to meet us
[05:45] also she got to know that aunt Shaggo & Hamid 'uncle'
[05:51] are with her
[05:54] uncle!
[05:55] yes
[05:56] very nice
[05:57] So now an aunt's husband will be called as 'uncle', right?
[06:01] its good, very nice
[06:06] and I've decided that now I will resolve this matter myself
[06:09] hmm.. 
[06:09] this is interference. I was telling you a poetry & you started to discuss Fariha
[06:16] if you allow me, then can I tell you again?
[06:21] please continue
[06:23] I only have one complaint from my life
[06:27] I think I am not telling you in the right manner
[06:28] No no, sorry sorry...  please tell me
[06:33] I only have one complaint from my life... 
[06:36] now I will tell you the rest tomorrow
[06:38] No, please wait
no, you continue laughing
[06:40] it will take some time, such griefs are very heavy
[06:45] that's why I was saying, you should have called him here. He must have felt a bit okay
[06:49] I had called him, asked him to come. He said, I am going home & will be back by evening
[06:55] I said to him, shall I come? 
but he said no
[06:58] so I became quiet
[07:00] may God have mercy
[07:02] and give him courage to tolerate this
[07:06] hmm... 
[07:08] nobody can fill the space of a father
[07:28] Greetings!
[07:29] I want to meet the gym's owner
[07:32] Gym's owner?
He is the gym's owner

[08:48] girls will also start coming because of her
[08:50] really, what are you saying?
yes!
[08:53] she is looking like a model though
[08:56] but how we will control the boys then?

[09:03] we'll manage something, everything will be set. Don't take tension

[10:59] hey Jojo, look!
[11:02] our gym is blooming a lot because of a woman's presence
[11:10] I can see that

[11:18] Get lost! *I have to ask Farhad*

[11:32] See, do such a work that Farhad shall feel proud of you
[11:43] but she is a girl, what she'll do with this gym?

[13:52] I will take a bus
[13:54] it doesn't look good to go in a bus
[13:57] Rickshaw! please stop brother
[14:02] brother, take her home. Here is your money
[14:05] and be careful, don't speed up
[14:07] hey no no, there is no need to pay him. I will give him
[14:09] its ok, please sit
[14:17] bye!
[14:20] I am all gone!
[14:57] Farhad
[15:00] I am really sorry. As I had gone without informing you
[15:04] I was having a lot of difficulty over here while staying alone, that's why
[15:08] But, you should have also called me once
[15:14] Farhad
[15:17] I want to be there for you, but at least talk to me
[15:23] Fariha, they have fired me from my job
[15:28] Why?
[15:31] I had misbehaved with my manager
[15:34] also I have beaten him
[15:39] why did you do this?
[15:45] that guy had made my life a living hell, Fariha!
[15:50] and today, he talked rubbish about my father. That's why I beat him up
[15:56] Okay
[15:59] do some rest, I think you need some rest
[16:01] come
[16:04] No, I...
[16:06] everyone is waiting for me at my house, I should go
[16:10] let me get some clothes
[16:12] I am leaving then
[16:53] I..
[17:00] I won't be needing this office shirt anymore
[17:26] Fariha, you should have seen the face of that guy
[17:33] what are you doing!
[17:40] I have thrashed him very badly
[17:52] are you fine?
[18:02] No Fariha
[18:05] I am not fine
[18:12] I didn't had any worth in front of my father as well
[18:19] he always used to think that I can never do anything
[18:21] I am useless
[18:27] that's why he died after transferring his catering business on Kiran's name
[18:31] and her greedy husband, who used to ask for something or the other at each & every minute in the name of dowry
[18:40] he considered him better than me!
[18:46] while leaving he said to him, take care of my family after me
[18:51] because my son isn't capable enough
[18:58] and my boss!
[19:00] he used to look at me with disrespect!
[19:05] because I don't know how to speak English fluently
[19:08] as I am Urdu speaking
[19:12] what difference does it make if I am a topper?
[19:14] it doesn't make any difference
look down!
[19:24] Farhad
[19:26] Look here, there isn't any such thing
[19:29] there isn't any such thing, you are so nice!
[19:31] why are you with me?
[19:34] Fariha, why do you love me?
[19:39] why do you love such a looser guy?
[19:42] I couldn't keep a job of thirty five thousand rupees only, Fariha
[19:46] and I don't have any other offer
[19:49] Fariha, I have nothing!
[19:52] why are you with me?
Farhad, that's okay
[19:57] its completely okay, no problem
[20:12] please go to your aunt's house for a few days
[20:14] please understand my problem, please Fariha
[20:17] please go to your aunt's house for a few days
[20:20] mom won't eat food without me, I have to go there
[20:26] Okay
[20:34] I shall leave now
[21:05] dear, there is nothing to worry
[21:07] he is in grief, that's why. He will be fine
[21:11] what if he didn't get fine, then?
[21:15] I had gone to do a few important work
[21:18] now I am back
[21:20] You won't go anywhere, you won't go to your wife.
[21:22] Promise me, in God's name
[21:24] promise me that you won't go!
[21:35] Shaggo
[21:37] yes
[21:39] what's the matter, you seem worried
[21:44] Hamid, I am worried about Fariha & Farhad
[21:49] why, did something happen?
[21:51] did Fariha tell something?
[21:54] Fariha hardly tells anything
[21:59] actually Farhad's life has experienced such a big accident
[22:05] and I think, this incident will affect the lives of both of them
[22:13] the responsibilities are increasing on Farhad
[22:16] but I think, Farhad is not capable enough to fulfill these responsibilities
[22:27] what if he...
[22:31] did injustice with Fariha in all this, then?
[22:36] what if he leaves Fariha at this point of life, or what if he gets mislead then?
[22:49] What if their relation had to pay the cost of all this
[22:55] Hamid...
Shaggo
[22:58] life is like a teacher
[23:01] who pats your back with kindness when you do good
[23:05] but it thrash you off very badly whenever you do bad
[23:10] every person in this world has to give their exam them self
[23:14] both of them will fall down, & stand again & it will be continued many times
[23:18] but I believe that God will never do injustice with them
[23:25] anyways...
[23:28] right now you are doing injustice with your ice-cream
[23:32] now it will start flowing after melting
[23:37] will you eat your ice-cream, or shall I tell you the poetry?
[23:39] No no, I am eating the ice-cream
[23:48] Mom, you always make me understand. Why don't you explain dad sometime?
[23:53] People have advanced so much & we are still stuck with the old business & house
[23:58] Saqib, for your father. This house, his family & his business is everything!
[24:06] but mom, the world has moved too far
[24:09] here people are expanding their businesses, and the people who doesn't go with the flow remains behind
[24:14] people are branching-out their business
[24:16] their fathers are helping them
[24:18] but here I think dad is after me so that he can stop me for achieving anything more than him
[24:24] there isn't any such thing
[24:26] give him some time to understand your point
[24:29] You started to argue with him about your share of inheritance as soon as you entered the house
[24:33] what is this way?
[24:35] mom, I hardly have any time
[24:39] my family is about to expand & my income is same
[24:44] family is about to expand?
[24:47] what do you mean?
[24:50] I was about to give you the good news
[24:55] Ramsha is pregnant
[24:59] what!
[25:01] such a big good news, Saqib!
[25:05] And you have started the fuss about your separate business on such a joyous occasion?
[25:12] so mom, I don't want my upcoming generation to open their eyes in this house
[25:16] Mom, Ramsha's brother bought a very nice house in Defence
[25:23] I also want to become successful, I don't want to stay at the same point mom
[25:30] Saqib
[25:32] if you'll compete with others
[25:35] then its a never ending race
[25:39] then you'll always keep on counting your deficiencies instead of your qualities!
[25:43] mom, its about every person's perspective
[25:46] I've set some of my goals, and I will achieve them by any means. That's it!
[25:50] its my final decision
[25:55] he has gone, he won't come back
[25:58] his wife must have called him
[26:01] aunty, he will come...
you are lying!
[26:04] you are lying, Jojo. He will never come
[26:07] aunty, don't worry
I have no one
[26:10] I don't have anyone
[26:12] my son left me, also Yaqoob died
[26:17] Farhad
[26:19] aunty...
his wife called him, he has gone
[26:24] he won't come back
[26:26] what will I do now?
[26:27] what will I do?
what will I do without him?
[26:31] eve Kiran is not here
[26:34] Aunty, he is here. He will come in a while. Don't worry
[26:43] aunty, he has come
[26:45] you are lying, Jojo..
[26:47] aunty look
[26:52] don't go after leaving me alone, for God sake
[26:59] you cannot go to your wife, for God sake
[27:03] I have no one. What will I do?
[27:08] I had gone to do a few important work
[27:10] now I am back
[27:12] You won't go anywhere, you won't go to your wife. Promise me, in God's name
[27:16] promise me that you won't go!
[27:23] I've brought my belongings
[27:26] to live with you
[27:28] but promise me one thing
[27:30] yes..
[27:32] is there more stuff?
[27:33] yes, but promise me one thing first
[27:35] yes
[27:36] will you go to the doctor with me?
[27:40] will you stay here?
[27:42] Okay
[27:44] You won't go anywhere... right?
[27:48] you won't go anywhere
[28:26] Greetings aunt Channo, please come
[28:29] Greetings!
[28:32] I saw your flat's light, so I came
[28:35] I thought to check upon yours & Farhad's well-being
[28:38] He is not here, but I am. Please come in, why are you standing there?
[28:41] please come, sit
[28:43] he is not here?
[28:44] shall I bring something?
Water or so?
[28:45] No no, please sit
[28:53] are you worried?
[28:56] what's the matter?
[28:59] Channo aunty you had said...
[29:01] you were absolutely correct that a few incidents in life changes a person
[29:08] he is not that Farhad
I don't' understand, what is happening
[29:13] dear, there is nothing to worry
[29:15] he is in grief, that's why. He will be fine
[29:19] what if he didn't get fine, then?
[29:24] I hope he is not thinking that I am responsible for all this
[29:28] Did Farhad say anything like that?
[29:31] No, he hasn't said anything, but I have felt it
[29:40] Right now he is upset with the entire world, including me
[29:45] dear, there are various dimensions of every person
[29:48] and with time, you will see them
[29:51] just don't worry & give him some time. He will be fine
[29:56] no matter whatever you want to do, but you won't be able to do anything at this time
[30:02] let him be
[30:04] Channo aunty, I do understand that his family needs him
[30:09] but there is a distance which is increasing between us
[30:11] If I say anything, I will sound 'selfish,' and I don't want to do that.
[30:15] then tell me, what shall I do?
[30:18] I can only give you one advice, have patience
[30:23] every person has their own limit of patience & tolerance
[30:27] you have to decide the level of your patience, that's it!
[30:36] I'm sorry, I didn't ask if you wanted tea or anything. Can I bring something for you?
[30:43] Ok brother, I'll talk to you later as Saqib is here
[30:49] you also take care. Bye!
[30:55] what happen, did you talk to her?
[30:58] yes
[31:00] what "yes"? Tell me about the entire discussion
[31:04] today I've learnt how to prepare tamarind & plum juice in summers
[31:10] what rubbish you are talking?
[31:12] I had gone to discuss property related matter, so I had discussed it what else

[31:17] also I have explained mom, she will make dad understand
[31:20] and..
[31:22] and what? tell me the entire story
[31:25] and I've told mom that God is about to bless us with a baby
[31:31] why did you tell her?
[31:34] what do you mean by that? 
After all, she is my mother, won't I tell her?
[31:38] she was so happy
[31:41] I don't think so
[31:44] why are you saying this?
[31:46] I mean if she had been happy, wouldn't she be blessing me with her prayers?
[31:50] I am about to give her the first happiness of this house
[31:53] If there had been another family, they would have made the ground and sky one
[31:56] Mom is very happy
[31:59] very happy!
[32:00] let it be, Saqib
[32:01] If Fariha had been expecting a baby, then you would have seen
[32:04] Oh... whose name are you mentioning on such a joyous occasion?
[32:09] you don't have to worry, I am with you
[32:13] Ok?
[32:14] I will do such a celebration that the entire world will see
you'll see
[32:18] just don't take it to your heart
[32:24] are you happy?
[32:26] I've talked about the property, also I have talked to mom. At least be happy now
[32:35] and listen, make me a cup of tea
[32:38] you shall serve me
[32:40] Ok then, let me bring tea for you

[33:01] Bye!
[33:04] Greetings!*
[33:06] hey!
[33:10] what happened?
[33:13] why are you looking at me with a smile?
[33:16] When a wife looks at her husband in this manner as he comes back home from work, it removes all the tiredness.
[33:22] sister Rashda had called
[33:24] really?
yes
[33:26] actually there is a good news
[33:31] yes, so you can tell me the good news without suspense
[33:39] our Saqib...
[33:44] is about to become a father
[33:47] Saqib?
[33:51] Shaggo, you've told me such a big good news. All praise to God!
[33:57] may God bless them both
[34:03] Hamid
[34:06] actually I was thinking that... 
yes, so you were thinking the right thing
[34:11] what was I thinking?
[34:11] on such occasions, we should hug our loved ones by forgetting all the differences
[34:20] Hamid, you've removed my such a big dilemma
[34:26] Shaggo, what's there about dilemma?
[34:29] I've only said what is correct. Right?
[34:34] Its quite late now, so we'll do one thing. 
We'll go tomorrow & give them a surprise
[34:40] really?
yes
[34:43] thank you!
[34:45] you had asked me to bring a few house related things
[34:47] yes
[34:48] let me keep them
[34:49] tell Basharat
[34:53] Basharat
[34:56] don't know when he is going to come
[36:00] hello Kiran!
[36:03] Farhad, has mom slept?
[36:07] yes, she did
[36:09] I made her go to sleep with  a lot of difficulty
[36:11] I know you must have gone there
[36:16] I just wanted to discuss something important with you
[36:21] yes, tell me
[36:23] Farhad, now it's very important for you to sit in the kitchen (catering business)
[36:31] Kiran, we had already discussed it
[36:34] Farhad
[36:36] Farhad... the matter is that I cannot take this responsibility at this moment. Ok?
[36:46] Also, I can't trust anyone except for you
[36:50] right?
[36:51] talk to Shahzain
[36:53] at that time he was jumping & telling everyone that he was so close to our dad
[36:56] now let him do whatever he wants to
[37:03] Farhad, I don't want our catering business to go in Shahzain's hands
[37:12] will you tell me the matter clearly?
[37:17] earlier, you always used to praise Shahzain
[37:20] if he is so good then trust him
[37:28] as it is, he can handle it better than me
[37:39] there is no as such matter, what can be the matter?
[37:43] he goes to the bank, he hardly have any time
[37:47] and Farhad, what does he know about this work?
[37:51] but you know this work, you've spent your entire life in it. Right?
[37:59] its our father's last memorable, Farhad
[38:02] our dad's last memorable
[38:07] dad wanted to keep this business within his family
[38:12] I don't want anything wrong to happen because of our carelessness
[38:16] I don't want to loose dad's last memorable, his catering business. Ok?
[38:23] but Kiran...
[38:24] Farhad
[38:25] Farhad
[38:29] please... Ok?
[38:36] for me
[38:39] its very important for you to sit in the kitchen
[38:44] try to understand my point
[38:47] for your sister's sake
[38:49] for your sister, ok?
[38:55] Ok fine
[38:58] I will handle the catering business
[39:11] Kiran
[39:16] Kiran
[39:20] Kiran, where are you?
[39:22] yes
[39:23] I had been calling you since so long, what were you doing there?
[39:26] Nothing, just like that
[39:30] with whom you were talking?
[39:31] No... with no one
[39:41] so you are doing these conspiracies!
[39:44] that's why you couldn't hear me
[39:48] Shahzain please
[39:50] why are you testing my patience Kiran? Tell me
[39:53] Why are you compelling me?
Shahzain!
[39:55] my hand hurts
[39:56] then go & tell your brother that what do I want. You won't get hurt then
[40:02] Kiran look, you know how much I love you
[40:06] but I love my plans more than that, understand?
[40:10] and I am afraid, if you take more time in listening to me
[40:15] then you have to pay much heavier cost, understand?
[40:23] hold your mobile!
