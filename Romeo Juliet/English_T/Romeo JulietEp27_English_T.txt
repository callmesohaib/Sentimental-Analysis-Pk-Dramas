[00:17] We don't want to make any relation with such an ill-mannered & arrogant man!
[00:19] Think before you speak!
 Don't you know where you are standing? 
[00:22] See, not only elders but even the younger ones doesn't have any manners to talk to their elders
[00:26] how dare you to invite that man to my house?
[00:29] dad, there might be a misunderstanding. At least, try talking to them once 
[00:32] there is no misunderstanding.
[00:34] love is an emotion
[00:39] but when the reality of life is added to it
[00:45] then one needs to take many bitter sips 
[00:48]  you won't go to meet him at all 
[00:50] what Shahzain, but... 
no ifs or buts
[00:52] didn't you hear what I had said? 
You will not go to meet him
[01:56] actually... 
[01:58] actually mom.
[02:05] actually I need your help, Billu
[02:10] what happened?
[02:11] I want to use your phone to speak to Farhad
[02:17] but sister, today is your engagement
[02:21] I know. That's what I wanted to tell him
[02:24] sister look, if anyone gets to know then all hell will break loose on us
[02:28] No, I just want to tell this to him. He has this much of right though Billu
[02:33] sister, first promise me that he won't come in the middle of the engagement as a hero?
[02:39] because I cannot take this risk
[02:42] I just want to inform him that today I am getting engaged to someone else
[02:48] so he shall not wait for me
[02:50] now give me your phone
[02:52] thank you!
[02:55] sister, be quick else they'll thrash us very badly
[03:01] here you go, do let me know if he replies
[03:08] keep checking
[03:58] No no... 
[04:00] No... no!
[04:02] No... 
[04:03] what happened, brother?
[04:06] Jojo, Freeha is getting engaged
[04:10] this had to happen
[04:14] what are you saying?
[04:16] how can she become of someone else so easily?
[04:18] what will you do now?
[04:20] will you enter her house? Or will you call off her engagement like a hero?
[04:23] so that her family shall get more humiliated
[04:26] oh brother, if you will go now then they'll directly shoot you 
[04:29] what else shall I do? Shall I keep looking at the spectacle?
[04:32] check the message, she isn't saying that come & save me
[04:36] she is saying, "don't wait for me"
[04:38] she doesn't want to fight this battle, understand this
[04:42] She is testing my love for her
[04:45] I am telling you, she is testing my love for her
[04:47] stop it, man!
[04:49] if she says it herself that "Farhad come, & save me please"
[04:52] then its understandable, then I will go with you too
[04:55] right now that poor girl is in such a difficulty that she had sent a message from her cousin's number
[04:59] you are adding her worries
[05:02] what are you doing?
[05:03] I want to talk to her
[05:04] don't do this, Farhad
[05:33] have you got the answer?
[05:35] stop it now, Farhad. Please
[05:37] move on now, leave it
[05:44] where are you going?
[05:45] hey Farhad!
[05:49] your mom is calling you
[05:51] she is saying, which color clothes would you like to wear from Zara's wedding clothes?
[05:59] who is calling you?
[06:02] its a wrong number, don't know who is calling from morning
[06:05] well... 
[06:05] really? So which color will you wear today?
[06:10] White
[06:11] not white but blue

[06:15] because I wanted to see your long face
[06:42] medicine
[06:47] how are you feeling now?
[06:59] I am feeling a bit of weakness
[07:04] press my clothes, so that I can visit the kitchen
[07:08] rest at home today
[07:11] is there anyone to look after over there? Everyone has gone
[07:17] Shamshad & other guys are there
[07:19] its not their work
[07:22] I find this kitchen on its right place
[07:26] I feel it as my family
[07:29] I will go there after resting for a while
[07:36] I know you are missing him too
[07:43] you are elder, please forgive him
[07:47] forgiveness for what?
[07:50] we forgive them who apologizes, who realizes
[07:56] did he apologized?

[08:06] wake me up after an hour
[08:10] tea...

[15:55] heartiest congratulations to you too
[15:57] brother Zaman, if you don't mind. I mean if you don't have an objection
[16:04] then I want to do the wedding & wedding reception as soon as possible
[16:11] I mean, don't worry about the preparations
[16:14] actually I am not in the favor of long engagements
[16:17] oh sir, you have uttered our words
[16:21] we don't need anything else, we just want our daughter Freeha to become the liveliness of our house
[16:26] what else can be more big than this?
[16:29] and we really don't like to get into all such lengthy matters
[16:33] its such a good thing
[16:36] Sameer is going back to America after two weeks
[16:40] so I want the wedding to happen before that
[16:42] yes, absolutely!
[18:14] hello Freeha!
[18:16] its Bilal speaking
[18:19] how is Freeha?
[18:21] She is not fine at all, today she got engaged but.. 
[18:26] but?
[18:28] She has tired herself by crying continuously. Brother, she isn't happy with this proposal at all
[18:34] I didn't tell her that you have called
[18:38] brother, there is so much tensed situation in the house
[18:42] I don't know whether I am doing right or not, but I can't see her in this condition
[18:49] can I talk to her?
[18:50] no, you cannot. If somebody saw her on the phone at this hour then all hell will break loose
[18:58] let me see, if I get a chance tomorrow then I will make you speak to her
[19:02] Ok
[19:05] sorry, I don't know whether this call had made any affect on you or not but
[19:09] I am feeling very guilty
[19:14] thank you, Bilal
[19:29] brother Saqib, that guy has gone to sister Freeha's room
[19:33] I won't spare him!
[19:36] have you gone mad? There has been a spectacle outside, Farhad. We cannot leave now
[19:39] I will handle all that
[19:42] my brother will kill you!
[19:45] Asif... Rehan
[21:13] Farhad, you have come
[21:15] how I couldn't have come?
[21:18] your face is telling me that how you are
[21:24] Farhad, do you know I can't tolerate it
[21:29] I thought I will compromise for my father & family. But I am unable to do it
[21:37] whenever I think that I have to spend my life with some else than you
[21:42] I started feeling suffocated
[21:46] I cannot live without you, Freeha
[21:51] Farhad, I am unable to do it. Its better to die than this
[21:59] just say it once
[22:03] just say it once, "take me from here".
I swear upon God, nobody can stop me at all!
[22:08] we'll live somewhere, we'll manage somehow
[22:14] I will keep you happy, Freeha
[22:20] right now I don't have much to give you but..
[22:24] I will keep you happy
[22:26] I will take very good care of you, also I will fulfill your every desire
[22:32] just say it once, "take me away from here Farhad"
[22:39] take me away from here, Farhad
[22:44] take me with you
[22:48] keep it with you
[22:50] let me do some arrangements, until then wait for my call
[22:54] Freeha, I will come back
[22:58] I love you!
[23:01] I love you, Farhad
[23:13] thief, thief...
brother Saqib, there is a thief in the house
[23:16] go from here
[23:17] brother Saqib!
leave
[23:19] brother Saqib, there is a thief in our house
[23:21] brother Saqib!
stop, else I will shoot you
[23:23] wait... stop!
[23:36] stop!
brother Saqib, there is a thief in our house
[23:41] lets go!
[23:42] how come you are here?
[23:44] pack you necessary stuff right away, we'll leave now
[23:46] right now?
yes, right now
[23:49] Tanvir, Ahmed...
[23:50] what happened?
[23:53] brother Saqib, that guy has gone to sister Freeha's room
[23:57] I won't spare him!
[24:00] have you gone mad? There has been a spectacle outside, Farhad. We cannot leave now
[24:03] I will handle all that
[24:06] my brother will kill you!
[24:09] Asif... Rehan, where are you guys? Are you all dead?
[24:14] nobody will say anything to you until I am here, just pack your things. We'll leave right away
[24:17] you had said that you want to go with me
[24:19] yes, I want to go but...
[24:23] we won't take any foolish decision while being emotional
[24:26] somebody has entered the house, go check each & every corner of the house
[24:29] what happened, why there is so much of noise?
[24:31] somebody has entered the house, and the guard is saying that he saw someone nearby Freeha'a room
[24:35] Farhad, look at me. Please listen to me & go from here right away
[24:40] oh my daughter, come quickly. 
Oh God, have mercy
[24:48] nobody is here
[24:50] Freeha
[24:52] Freeha!
yes
[24:56] brother...
[24:59] there is so much of noise outside, can't you hear?
[25:01] No, I was in a deep sleep
[25:05] I have checked the entire house, but nobody is there
[25:08] what happened, is everything alright?
[25:10] yes yes, everything is fine. It seems that someone has entered the house
[25:14] what?
[25:15] everything is fine now, just go to sleep
[25:18] you've made the noise for no reason, come on
[25:22] we've kept a close eye on each & every corner of this house
[25:38] are you crazy! How can you put your life in danger?
[25:44] You had said to me, if she'll say it with her own mouth then you'll support me
[25:48] she has said it now
[25:50] I had said that..
[25:52] how would I know that she'll say "yes" in real?
[25:56] and are you crazy? A Romeo, you entered her house
[26:00] listen to me, the end of Romeo & Juliet isn't good
[26:05] why are you after your life?
[26:07] it was the Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet & this one is of Burns Road
[26:10] that's why I am saying that its more dangerous
[26:14] if your Shakespeare's had been from Karachi then he wouldn't be using any ancient English
[26:18] here they say, "hey firecracker where are you going?"
[26:22] even their villain is so sophisticated
[26:25] here they press the lock of the gun & buries a man
[26:29] will I sit idly? I know how to answer back
[26:34] and I have never called her a "firecracker" got it!
[26:40] brother look, try to understand
[26:42] don't do this, everything will be ruined
[26:45] so whatever is happening now, is it right?
Her parents are marrying her forcefully
[26:50] and we shall sacrifice our love for our parents
[26:56] my parents got married as per their family's consent, right?
[26:58] now look at their condition
[27:00] my mother hardly speaks in front of my father until today
[27:03] she has become a patient of depression
[27:05] but she won't agree
[27:07] and dad
[27:09] until today, I haven't seen her talking to mom with love
[27:14] I heard that he used to love someone else, but then he got married to my mom. So now he is just fulfilling it
[27:19] Oh brother, I don't need such a life
[27:24] all the time they say, "this used to happen in our era, that used to happen in our era." May their era go to hell!
[27:29] now its our era, so let us live & breathe
[27:33] what more can happen? The marriage won't work out, then?
[27:39] oho, the marriage didn't work out. Its an ailment for life time
[27:41] and if it works out, then they'll say that you will rot in hell because you haven't honored your family
[27:47] if there is a pit here, then there is a well over there
[27:48] oh brother, if I have to drown by any means then at least let me jump as per my choice
[28:03] Jojo, I wish I had some other way as well
[28:07] but I don't have it
[28:11] I cannot see her in this condition
[28:15] if she had to accept her fate then I swear upon God, I would have gone from her life for forever
[28:24] she won't be able to tolerate all this
[28:44] now since she has said to me once
[28:46] "to take me away from here"
[28:49] So, I will do my level best for her
[29:09] see...
[29:11] if you don't want to get into all this, then don't
[29:14] Its ok
[29:18] but don't stop me
[29:22] Fine!
[29:25] let me do the preparations then
[29:27] did it ever happen, that I have left you alone?
[29:29] brother, since you are ready so I am ready as well
[33:13] Thank you!
[33:22] I think, Freeha has accepted this relation
[33:27] otherwise, I was so afraid that what if she does something inappropriate on the eleventh hour
[33:38] are we doing the right thing?
[33:40] what do you mean?
[33:44] I can see her pain from her eyes
[33:47] its he childish nature
[33:49] you'll see, once she will get married then she will realize it herself
[33:54] that her parents had made an absolute right decision for her
[33:59] what if like me...
[34:04] she stayed stubborn after her marriage then?
[34:07] then her in-laws will fix her mind
[34:11] nobody will be as bad as me, if her in-laws tried to talk to her harshly
[34:17] I know... Freeha is your weakness
[34:22] you love her a lot
[34:25] but... you have to make your heart strong
[34:28] now don't say such things in front of her
[34:31] otherwise, she will come back to our house after a few days
[34:35] upon the fact that they didn't prepared the omelet of her choice
[34:38] its obvious that a person's mood will be off if the food isn't as per one's choice
[34:45] I will miss Freeha a lot
[34:47] but, we are parents & we have to keep our heart strong
[34:54] Just pray that God bless her with good fate
[34:59] Ameen
[35:01] God, please bless my daughter with good fate
[35:05] Ameen
[35:09] you should have put some sugar in the tea
[35:11] your sugar is already high, so you won't get the sugar. Drink it as it is
[35:15] now become habitual of it
[35:17] if Freeha had been here, then she would have put some sugar in it
[35:38] sister, are you free? I wanted to talk to you
[35:41] yes, what happened? Come sit
[35:47] what's the matter?
[35:54] are you fine?
[35:56] yes?
[35:59] actually sister...
[36:04] sister, I had lied to you
[36:08] do you remember, you had told me to inform you if Farhad sends any message
[36:13] hmm...
[36:14] sister, Farhad had called. But I sent him a message "not to call again"
[36:20] sister, I swear upon God I was afraid
[36:24] sister, I've been observing since engagement day that you aren't happy. Right?
[36:29] this house was lively because of you, and you've lost your smile. This is not right, sister
[36:34] Its ok
[36:35] don't worry too much, don't think about these things
[36:39] I had told Farhad that I will make him speak to you as soon as I will get a chance
[36:44] sister, please talk to him
[36:45] as I said, leave all these things
[36:48] ok listen
[36:53] a lot is going to happen in a next few days
[36:57] will you promise me one thing?
[36:58] yes sister God promise
[37:01] no matter what happens
[37:04] you will never consider your sister wrong, please
[37:07] it cannot happen, sister
[37:09] you are the best of all
[37:12] see, you look good like this
[37:15] and you were sad for no reason
[37:19] sister, shall I tell you something? But please don't tell anyone
[37:22] I will go & tell them right away!
[37:24] I was just joking, come on tell me
[37:27] sister..
yes
[37:28] actually there is a girl in my class
[37:36] and I like her
[37:39] but there is one problem sister, she isn't Memon. They won't get me married to her
[37:44] it means Zara's wedding was just an excuse for your gym, right?
[37:47] and you are doing all this hard work for that girl!
[37:51] sister, tell me something.
[37:52] before liking someone his/her bank balance, property, wealth, gold, background card. Why all this is so complicated?
[38:01] we don't see so much of calculations in love, Ok?
[38:05] but... this is not the right time for you to think about all these things
[38:09] you've got plenty of life to think about such things. Right now just focus on your studies but...
[38:15] I promise you
[38:17] if you ever needed your sister's help
[38:21] then I will always stand by your every decision, ok?
[38:24] promise?
yes! deal done
[38:28] hmm... I see
[38:32] stop it sister
[38:33] there is no need to be so shy, you are already so cute
[38:45] hello!
hello Freeha?
[38:48] listen, all the preparations are completed
[38:50] you don't need to worry about anything
[38:55] aren't we doing anything wrong?
[38:59] are you being double minded?
[39:01] No, I am just scared that will our families forgive us?
[39:06] until when they'll be angry?
[39:08] after all, one day or the other they'll understand that why we took this step'
[39:13] Farhad, can we stay happy or keep others happy?
[39:19] if I will think about myself then its selfishness, & if I will agree with them then its the sacrifice of my love & happiness
[39:27] see..
[39:29] I don't want to force you for anything
[39:33] even if you change your decision today then
[39:37] I do understand...
[39:46] I know its a hard decision
[39:51] if you want some more time, you can take it
[39:57] won't you leave me?
[39:59] I won't leave you until my last breathe
[40:04] I don't have any doubt on my decision
[40:08] I want to make our own small world with you
[40:12] you are my wife, my friend...
[40:17] and my everything
[40:20] if you will be with me
[40:23] then I won't be needing anyone else
[40:29] and, we'll convince our families on the right time
[40:33] promise
[40:41] Ok, I am hanging up the call
[40:43] I will stay in touch
[40:45] Bye!
