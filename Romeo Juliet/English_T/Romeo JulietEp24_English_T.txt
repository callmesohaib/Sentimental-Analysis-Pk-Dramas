[00:13] Take out your phone. I'll tell Maqbool that there will be no wedding ceremony today.
[00:19] dad don't do this. The police will bail them out.
[00:23] If the police hands over our daughter to us, what respect will we have left?
[00:27] You are punishing me in your fight with Farhad.
[00:31] Tell me, think about it calmly.
[00:34] Is it something that you are willing to compromise our relationship over?
[00:38] Move away
oh Yaqoob, not this pot
[00:43] Look what I'll do to him.
You'll bust his head wide open!
[01:12] Thank God that you're back.
[01:20] Come on.
[01:28] My wife.
[01:31] Freeha.
[01:36] Greetings*
[01:45] Let me offer some charity in your name.
[01:59] I'll be right back.
[02:10] Greetings*
[02:12] Greetings*
[02:17] Farhad, so this is the one!
[02:22] Yes uncle.
[02:24] She is beautiful.
You'll get a good thrashing today.
[02:38] I told you not to come here.
[02:41] How dare you step foot inside my house?
[02:44] Uncle, this is her first time here.
I told you not to show your face here.
[02:51] I'll beat you two black and blue.
[02:53] He's right, this is the first time she's here. You kept talking about respect...
[02:58] Was she your lover? Where's your respect now?
You've buried it!
[03:04] I will show no respect anymore.
[03:08] Father, I had no other way.
So you made her run away from home?
[03:12] For a second did you think what me, your mother and sister would go through?
[03:20] And you?
[03:23] Did you think about your parents?
[03:29] A girl who doesn't respect her parents, how can she respect my home?
[03:46] How did you bring her here?
I invited them here.
[03:49] You might like any girl for your sons.
[03:55] I don't! Don't speak in my matters!
[04:01] Go son.
[04:04] Play this little game of yours.
[04:07] If she couldn't be loyal to her parents, then can she be loyal to anyone else?
[04:12] Do you have a place to live?
[04:17] Do you have a job? What will you feed her? What will you clothe her with?
[04:24] You can't take care of yourself and you've brought her here.
[04:27] Will you make him wander from place to place?
[04:30] Will you find peace then?
Leave it uncle.
[04:35] He likes seeing his children in pain.
[04:40] The doors of this house were closed on me and now you have an excuse to oust me from this house.
[04:45] Silence Farhad.
Why should I?
[04:48] Say whatever you want about me, I've been hearing it since I was a child.
[04:52] But I won't tolerate a word against her.
[04:54] Get out of here then!
[05:03] Silence!
[05:18] In your eyes I was never anything and maybe I'll never be able to become anything.
[05:25] But I'll become a good husband and father.
[05:52] Why are you standing here?
Begone!
[06:26] It's okay... he's angry right now. He'll get better after some time.
[06:32] I don't know why it occurred to me that he would restrain himself in front of you. But no!
[06:38] I was wrong thinking he could change.
[06:44] Tell me what we have to do next.
[06:55] Brother Isa is coming to pick me up.
[06:59] I'll take a look at a few houses.
[07:01] I'll arrange a place by tomorrow.
[07:05] I'll come along as well.
[07:06] Where will I take you?
[07:10] I want to get rid of this as soon as possible.
[07:14] To get out of here.
[07:18] Freeha...
[07:23] I don't need anyone else.
[07:26] I'll take care of everything
[07:40] Brother Esa is here, I'll be back soon.
[07:44] Bye*
[08:08] Greetings*
You can go.
[08:12] Isn't brother Yaqub not coming today as well?
[08:15] You should get used to seeing me now brother Shamshad.
[08:18] Brother Shahzain you didn't give me the deposit slip last time. I needed to file it.
[08:22] I have fifty other things to do.
[08:24] On top of that I have to take care of this catering business.
[08:27] Everything is digital nowadays, why are you bothering me with slips?
[08:30] You know brother Yaqub doesn't bother with these things.
[08:33] There must be some record in the bank.
[08:35] Find it there, where should I look for the slip now?
[08:38] No... I didn't say that. I need to pass it over the accountant.
[08:41] I understand! I'll talk to him.
[08:48] Why are these tables so dirty?
[08:51] Is there anyone here who works, or are they all lazy?
[08:57] You can do your work properly and you're worried about the accountant's work.
[09:02] Have these tables cleaned, I'll check them when I come back.
[09:53] Mother...
[09:55] Greetings mother....
Greetings to you too.
[10:02] The tea is made, I'll be right there with it.
Should I help?
[10:04] Sit down.
[10:26] Mother, I wanted to talk to you about something.
[10:31] About Shahzain.
[10:34] Mother... mother.
[10:39] Mother, is everything alright?
[10:41] I'm tired. Your father is putting me through a difficult test...
[10:45] I only have one son and he wants me to forget about him.
[10:49] He's asking me to think that he's dead.
[10:53] Why would I think he's dead?
[10:55] He's done what he did. Forgive him.
[11:00] Talk to your father, he'll listen to you.
[11:04] He's angry right now, he won't listen to anyone.
[11:09] Mother...
Call Shahzain, he respects him.
[11:15] He'll make him understand. Ask him to talk to your father.
[11:21] Shahzain?
Yes..
[11:25] Mother... Shahzain is against these things. It will make matter worst.
[11:32] He loves you... he listens to you. You can convince Shahzain.
[11:39] You left as well... Farhad relied on you.
[11:45] I can't talk to anyone here. I feel suffocated.
[11:51] I want to end myself.
Mother...
[11:58] if you lose strength right now, then what will happen to us?
[12:04] Listen to me carefully...
[12:07] Leave everything to time. I promise you that Farhad will walk through those doors.
[12:15] He will... don't lose strength.
[12:19] No... don't say such things...
[12:32] I'm right here with you.
[12:36] Farhad will be here as well. Leave everything to time.
[12:43] Leave it to time.
[13:05] Get up and run!
[13:55] What happened? Is there a fire or something?
[13:59] Empty the room, the police is here.
[14:02] Why?
Don't act so innocent and empty the room.
[14:18] Come with us!
[14:19] What happened?
be quiet, else I will slap you so hard
[14:24] but what happened? My husband is coming. I've called him, leave me!
[14:31] madam listen to me I've called my husband, he's coming here.
[14:35] why are you dragging me? Why aren't you listening to me?
[14:39] You won't be able to show your face to anyone after I'm done with you.
[15:57] He's my husband...
Shut up!
[16:40] She's been speaking for ages. I'll hit you with this stick, so be quiet!
[17:17] Fariya!
[17:19] They brought some guys from a hotel here, there has been a misunderstanding.
[17:22] Farhad... Farhad.
[17:25] I'm here, don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[17:30] They forced me to come here.
[17:35] Why is it locked!Hurry up she's my wife.
[17:39] Let us speak outside.
[17:40] So what if she's your wife? Where did you come from?
[17:44] If you're so concerned, then why did you leave her at such a sleazy place?
[18:00] It seems the blood in your veins is hot and thick!
[18:08] It seems like you've eaten a lot of protein.
[18:11] Who are you to go berserk in a police station?
[18:14] I'll file so many cases on you that you won't be able to go home.
[18:20] There has been a misunderstanding, she's my wife, we were married yesterday.
[18:26] Why did you choose such a place after getting married?
[18:30] I didn't know... I was looking for a new place.
[18:33] I was in a hurry and that's the only place I could find.
[18:35] You want me to believe this?
Sir I can testify.
[18:40] You are with him, why should I believe you? You'll go inside with him.
[18:46] I have the marriage certificate as well.
If you do, then bring it here!
[18:52] It's in the hotel.
I'll bring it sir.
[18:57] Sir, the marriage certification will be here soon, please take her out.
[18:59] Go and sit down.
[19:01] Are you going to tell me what to do?
[19:14] I can't ignore the fact of the place where we find you from.
[19:21] Stay in the police station for the night. We'll deal with this in the morning.
[19:33] Do you understand what you need to say when I call you?
[19:39] What kind of man are you? Why don't you understand one thing!
[19:44] The marriage certificate won't do anything, I know how these people are.
[19:48] On top of that I have him here.
[19:51] He thinks that he's a film hero. He held the police officer by the scruff of his neck.
[19:56] Do as you say. Don't be late.
[19:59] Hang up and be ready.
[20:06] Here is the marriage certificate sir.
[20:12] That was quick.
[20:18] How can I believe that this is real?
[20:23] What are you saying sir?
The place where we found you from...
[20:26] I can't ignore that fact.
[20:31] Stay in the police station for the night. We'll deal with this in the morning.
[20:34] I've been saying it for ages that she's my wife!
[20:39] My brother-in-law is an SP. He wants to talk to you.
[20:44] What should I do?
[20:49] He wants to talk to you. Talk to him.
[20:53] What is this? Have you gone insane?
[21:00] Here you go.
[21:05] Hello.
Is this SHO Moheez?
[21:08] It is.
[21:10] Who are you?
This is SP Jamshed Akram.
[21:13] I'm sure you've heard of me.
Yes sir.
[21:17] Yes. This is my brother-in-law and his friend.
[21:20] They are good kids and they are not who you think they are.
[21:23] Don't bother them. I'm talking to their families to make things better.
[21:29] The girls is from an honorable family.
[21:30] It's a family from Chinoy. I'm sure you've heard of them.
[21:33] Ofcourse, the ones from Askari?
[21:35] Yes, the very same.
But...
[21:39] her name isn't mentioned here.
[21:40] That's because it's from her mother's side.
[21:45] Sir, how can we leave them?
[21:47] Do you need a protocol? You already have the marriage certificate.
[21:51] Can't you do this simple task?
[21:54] Do you want me, an SP, to come to the police station in the middle of the night?
[21:58] If you can't do then let me know I'll talk to the IG.
[22:00] No sir, if he's your  family, then he's my family.
[22:05] Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[22:09] No... let's meet.
No sir...
[22:14] I'll take care of it.
No, let me come.
[22:17] No sir, I'll take care of it. They are like my family kids.
[22:22] I'll take care of it.
Alright.
[22:30] You should have told me before.
[22:34] I don't like showing off.
[22:37] I thought that the marriage certificate would be enough.
[22:41] But you...
You guy are from a humble family.
[22:49] These minor fights happen at home.
[22:56] Family is family after all. Just be careful.
[23:00] Alright? You guys can go. Let them go!
[23:06] Thank you... thank you very much brother Isa.
[23:11] I wonder what would have happened if you weren't here.
[23:13] You're like my little brother, just keep a cool head.
[23:18] Both of you acted very well.
[23:21] We didn't act, we were just lucky. Otherwise he didn't gave good intentions.
[23:27] Take care of her. Let me know if something happens.
[23:32] Take care.
Thank you
[23:37] Shall we go Fariya?
[23:41] Fariya? Shall we?
[23:50] Fariya, what happened?
[23:54] What happened.
[23:57] I was in lockup.
[24:00] Do you have any idea how scared I was?
[24:04] Did you see the people they took me away with?
[24:10] Or did you not see?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
[24:13] I want to go home.
[24:15] I want to go to my father. Take me home.
[24:22] I'm tired and I want to go home.
[24:26] Fariya, no one would help us at this time.
My father will.
[24:30] Father loves me. He's a little upset right now. He might shout at us...
[24:35] but he won't leave me like this. I know...
[24:40] Fariya, give me some time.
[24:43] I have my eyes on a few places. We'll shift in a few days.
[24:46] What will we do in a few days? Live in a similar hotel?
[24:51] Farhad, I want to go home. Please take me there.
[24:56] Please take me home today.
Relax.
[25:00] We can't go right now.
[25:03] I'll take you in the morning.
[25:08] What will we do now?
[25:16] There is one place.
[25:48] We'll stay here for the night.
[25:51] We'll leave before anyone arrives in the morning, to your father's home.
[26:01] We're safe here. Don't worry. Alright?
[26:56] Do you know...
[27:00] whenever mother and father used to fight.
[27:04] Father used to come here to sleep.
[27:11] Sometimes I used to run away from home and come here.
[27:20] Did you think about running away from home?
[27:26] I never thought of doing so.
[28:32] You're up?
[28:43] Eat something, then we'll leave.
[28:46] Tea?
[29:01] Fariya...
[29:07] Are you sure you want to go to your home?
[29:16] Do you remember the last time I went to your place, 
[29:19] they shoved me out of there?
[29:28] I don't expect anything less this time as well.
[29:31] Rather, I expect to get insulted.
[29:33] My father's heart will melt after he looks at me
[29:45] What if he asks you to stay?
[29:48] Only you?
[29:51] Will you stay without me?
[29:59] It's not like that. My father... is not like your father.
[30:10] Fariya...
[30:13] Whatever happened these last few days... I don't want you losing hope.
[30:20] I told you it's not like that. Father will help us.
[30:25] Let's go. I'll go and change.
[33:01] Fariya...
What happened to her?
[33:05] She's here with that guy.
What?
[33:28] Mother...
Silence!
[33:31] Not one more word. 
[33:35] What are you here for?
[33:38] This is my home. I came to my home.
[33:41] You left this home.
[33:45] This home isn't yours.
[33:53] But whatever happened was my compulsion.
[33:58] Compulsion?
[34:00] You were compelled?
[34:02] You are the one who compelled us to be helpless.
[34:05] Do you have any idea what we had endured because of what you did?
[34:14] Look at my brother's state?
[34:16] What happened to father?
[34:17] Don't you dare step a foot forward. You can't meet him.
[34:33] Don't you dare touch my wife!
[34:40] I will kill you.
We have married.
[34:57] Father, you too...
I don't want...
[35:01] this girl's dirty blood on my floor. No one's life will be ruined by her!
[35:07] I'm sorry... I know I hurt you but...
But... but... but...
[35:16] All you wanted was to impose your will.
[35:22] You are all grown up!
[35:26] Our decisions are becoming a burden on you. 
[35:31] Well you took them off... so why are you here?
[35:35] Did you think that you would come here cry and apologize and I would embrace you?
[35:48] You killed everything and everyone!
[35:55] And...
[35:58] Everyone used to tell me not to give you much freedom, 
[36:03] but I didn't listen to anyone.
[36:06] I trusted you more than I trusted myself and what did you do?
[36:13] For him... you left us all.
[36:20] You did all of this for love, right?
[36:25] Now stand by it... 
[36:27] you didn't need us when you were getting married, then why are you here now?
[36:31] Spend the rest of your life with him.
[36:34]  The doors of this house are closed on your forever!
[37:04] All of you are so unlucky!
[37:08] You are turning away a person like Fariya.
[37:19] You've lost your daughter.
[37:21] You heard what father said, right?
[37:23] Now get out... and don't you dare come back again.
[37:28] Go... go!
