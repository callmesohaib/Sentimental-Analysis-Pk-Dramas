[00:14] What are you doing here and how dare you to beat my daughter?
[00:18] I didn't beat her. That was just a mistake.
[00:20] You won't make that mistake again because she won't go with you now.
[00:24] He is so unpredictable. He argues with anyone anywhere anytime. He argued with policemen that night and spent whole night in lockup.
[00:31] What?
[00:33] Farhad spent whole night in lockup.
[00:35] We should give ourselves some time.
[00:41] And we should think by staying away from each other that what do we want from each other?
[00:46] But that will increase distances between us.
[01:01] You aren't giving me battle leaf these days.
[01:04] I have just given you that. Are you happy?
[01:08] I was right. I told you that doctor these days know nothing.
[01:13] They say difficult terminologies. Look at this, I can't even read it.
[01:21] Panic, depression, mental illness.
[01:24] She only checked me and that's it. She gave me very less medicine.
[01:29] So that's the good thing mom.
[01:34] You have been taking medicine throughout your life but they didn't benefit you.
[01:39] My son, illness has some name.
[01:43] Like BP, cancer and heart sickness.
For God's sake.
[01:49] Be thankful to God that you don't have any such disease.
[01:53] You are OK with all other diseases but not with mental illness.
[01:58] And what were you telling her that my mom cries. That's not the right thing to tell to any stranger.
[02:08] So don't you cry?
[02:20] I was six years old when I sat near your bed and held your hand first time.
[02:29] I used to get scared when I saw you.
[02:37] If medicine could have cured this disease
[02:41] then you would have been recovered from this disease by now. But medicines are not the solution to this disease.
[02:47] You are suffering from depression.
[02:52] And there is no harm in admitting it.
[02:57] If you would have admitted this earlier then
[03:04] You would have gotten that help much earlier which you needed badly.
[03:15] And you wouldn't be a sick, sad and scared mother.
[03:26] Rather you would be a happy, healthy and loving & caring mother.
[03:53] It was really difficult to spend life with my brother.
[03:56] What else would she had other than depression.
[04:00] This is not a big thing. These days all of us need a psychotherapist so don't get tense.
[04:07] Yes, I occasionally visit a psychotherapist and I feel relaxed after talking to him.
[04:13] You must try that as well.
[04:18] Bilqees, give me battle leaf. I am asking you but you are not giving me.
[04:34] Did Fareeha eat anything?
[04:38] Did she tell you anything that what will she do now?
[04:43] She doesn't have anything except regret.
[04:47] You know her since childhood so don't say that.
[04:53] So what should I say?
[04:56] We advised her so much and forbade her to do that.
[05:01] But she couldn't see anything except her love. What did she get by doing that?
[05:09] Zara but that was not Fareeha's fault. She is very upset.
[05:18] If it's not her fault then whose fault it is?
[05:22] Who forced her to marry like this?
[05:27] Such marriages have same consequences.
[05:31] If parents are not convinced with the marriage then that marriage is not a happy one.
[05:37] But marry to your loved one is not a sin.
[05:43] I admit that her approach was wrong
[05:46] but I am feeling from your words as if she has committed such a sin which can't be forgiven.
[05:55] She didn't commit any sin but she made this relationship by hurting uncle, aunt, her brother and all of us.
[06:04] And what is she getting by doing that except pain, sorrow and wounds on her body
[06:15] I have asked her to make decision with a cool head.
[06:21] Today when she in pain then uncle is feeling pain more than anyone else.
[06:27] So she should realize that she hurt her family.
[06:31] And when she is in need then you and uncle are her biggest support.
[06:41] Tell me aunt that if your door wouldn't be opened for her then where would she go?
[06:48] The reality of life is revealed in difficult time. Whole life can't be spent with love only.
[06:55] Zara, I don't want her to listen this conversation and  think that she has become a burden on me.
[07:09] You know that she is so dear to me and I can't see her in this condition.
[07:18] Don't worry, she is very sensitive and emotional at the moment.
[07:24] But she knows that you and uncle are her biggest supporters in this difficult time.
[07:32] She will definitely realize that she made a very big mistake by hurting her family's feelings.
[07:40] Aunt, Saad must be coming back from office so I must leave now.
[07:43] Wait, you should have lunch with us.
[07:46] Let me serve lunch.
[07:59] Why do you keep working all day?
Come here.
[08:04] I want to talk to you. Sit here. Come here.
[08:13] Sit here.
[08:15] And listen to me very carefully.
What's up?
[08:19] I went to restaurant and I asked Farhad to sell the restaurant.
[08:26] So what did he say?
[08:28] He said that he will discuss with family.
[08:33] So now it's your job to convince him and your family. Right?
[08:40] Farhad is very stubborn.
[08:44] It's not easy to convince him if he doesn't want to do that.
[08:49] And if he wants to continue this business then...
So you are there to convince him.
[08:55] You will convince him. Right?
[08:59] And you also want what I want.
[09:06] Here you are, it's his call.
[09:10] So you should talk to her as I told you. Talk to him.
[09:19] Receive the call. Put the call on speaker.
[09:27] Hi Kiran, how are you?
[09:32] Shahzain came here today and he told me that he has some buyers who want to buy our restaurant.
[09:38] Do you also want to sell this restaurant?
[09:43] Yes
[09:45] Kiran you insisted me to manage this restaurant business
[09:49] and you told me that this business shouldn't be sold at any cost but now
[09:54] you are saying this? Isn't Shahzain forcing you?
[10:06] Give me Shahzain
[10:18] I should have realized earlier that both you brother and sister are making me fool.
[10:26] No. No.
[10:28] Kiran you shouldn't have done that. You have done wrong to me.
[10:50] Fareeha my child, get up. Brother Yousuf wants to see you.
[11:01] My dear. Hey, you have a very high fever.
[11:08] It's just an ordinary fever.
[11:11] Why didn't you tell me if you were not feeling well.
[11:15] I didn't want to bother you.
[11:18] That's why I didn't tell you.
Get up, let's go to doctor.
[11:20] Why? I will take medicine with tea then I will be alright.
No.
[11:26] Not at all. Take this and get in brother Yousuf's car. We will go to doctor.
[11:32] Look at my attire, I haven't changed my dress.
No problem.
[11:37] Get up. Don't take tension. Everything will be alright.
[11:44] You are injured and you are not eating anything as well.
[11:56] Why have you got up? Lay down and close your eyes.
[12:01] Dad, why are you getting this much worried?
[12:05] It's only because of weakness and fever. I will be alright after taking medicine.
[12:09] Be thankful that your hand got saved from being fractured.
[12:13] I fell down and got injured.
[12:15] But how do you fall down every time.
[12:18] I can ask hospital management to provide you help if you want.
[12:22] You should tell police the truth that your husband tortures you so that they can help you.
[12:28] I am telling you that I fell down at home and got injured.
[12:32] I don't know when will women stop being their own enemy?
[12:40] Kiran, are you OK?
Yes.
[12:48] I fell down at home it's a minor injury.
Are you alright?
[12:54] I am feeling weakness because of fever.
[12:58] How do you know Fareeha?
[13:02] Where is Farhad?
[13:04] Dad, she is Farhad's sister Kiran and Kiran he is my dad.
Greetings.
[13:11] Farhad has no connection with my daughter now.
[13:15] What do you mean?
[13:18] I am feeling sad to see you in this condition.
[13:21] After seeing my daughter in this condition, I won't send her back with Farhad.
[13:28] Is everything alright? What happened Fareeha?
He beat my daughter.
[13:34] She came to me with these injuries on her forehead and arm.
[13:42] I beg you, please leave my daughter. She won't go back there.
Come on my child.
[13:54] Kiran take care of yourself.
[14:08] Who is there?
[14:14] Who is there?
[14:20] Kiran
[14:30] Why did you beat Fareeha? Why did you beat her?
[14:45] Tell me, how did you beat her?
[14:50] I didn't do that.
[14:51] I don't want to listen any nonsense and any clarification.
[14:58] Did you see mom's condition throughout our life? Right?
[15:05] Have you forgotten that?
[15:07] No problem you can forget that. You forgot your mother's condition but your sister is in front of you.
[15:14] So you should have seen your sister. So how
[15:18] Explain that how did you beat her?
[15:29] Has Shahzain done this?
Yes, he has done this. So what?
[15:35] I will kill him.
Farhad.
[15:40] Stop, stop, stop.
[15:48] You keep fighting, arguing and showing anger all the time.
[15:56] It is rightly said that once man starts to beat woman then he doesn't stop.
[16:09] You love her more immensely. Right?
[16:16] You love Fareeha immensely. Right?
[16:23] You beat her. You beat her but why?
[16:31] Tell me.
[16:32] That happened in anger. I didn't beat her. That was just a mistake.
Mistake?
[16:41] That happened mistakenly. No problem my brother. It happens.
[16:49] No problem, you did that mistakenly and you will do that out of anger one day and you will do this to her as well.
[16:56] You will do this to her Farhad. Right?
[17:00] It happens by mistake.
[17:08] Why didn't you tell me?
[17:13] Because I was scared of your anger.
[17:19] I got scared that you can do anything.
[17:43] Kiran I am sorry.
No.
[17:47] Kiran I am sorry.
[18:18] Dad, trust me, Farhad didn't beat me.
[18:25] Yes he was in anger and we were fighting.
[18:28] He pushed me and I fell down. I got injured because of table.
[18:38] It's been forty years since I married your mother.
[18:45] We fought a lot and it happens in every relation. No relation is perfect.
[18:52] But I never beat her.
[18:57] And this pushing is also physical abuse.
[19:05] Every relationship has a limit and a boundary and when that limit is crossed
[19:14] Then the relationship starts to waver.
[19:19] You came to me in injured condition.
[19:25] I felt sorry. And when I saw his sister in hospital today, my blood boiled. She is his sister.
[19:38] If an animal gets injured mistakenly or any dog or cat gets hit by car then we feel pain for that.
[19:50] But what type of men are they who beat their wives?
[19:59] They are like a black spot on humanity and manhood.
[20:08] My belief has become more strong after seeing that girl in hospital today.
[20:12] You won't go back to that house again.
[20:15] Dad, I admit that Farhad has made that mistake but he is not like that.
[20:22] The condition of his sister I saw in hospital today
[20:27] This is a common problem in so many families.
[20:30] I think this is a deep rooted problem of their family to beat women so we will have to check that.
[20:39] I am only concerned for you.
[20:44] I am only concerned about you.
[20:46] I don't understand one thing that men claim to safeguard their women.
[20:57] But they forget that devil is sitting within their bodies.
[21:14] What else do you want to see except her broken arm?
[21:19] A woman has to tolerate with that but you won't understand that.
[21:24] Let him come in please.
[21:31] I also want to talk to him.
[22:18] I have given her medicine. She is taking rest now.
[22:27] Did you know about that?
[22:35] Farhad...
Kiran used to come here and met all of you.
[22:44] Didn't you see her bruises and injuries?
[22:50] Didn't you ask whether everything is alright?
[23:01] She didn't tell anything.
[23:06] How could I ask her to leave her husband?
[23:15] It means that you knew about that.
[23:19] I didn't know that matter has got this much intense.
[23:29] I had to take care of everything.
[23:32] She got married after great difficulty.
[23:38] I didn't want to ruin her house.
[23:44] But she was not happy in her house.
[23:49] What else did you want to see except her injuries and broken arm?
[23:57] A woman has to bear that but you can't understand that.
[24:05] She has to bear that?
[24:09] What did you get by tolerating throughout your life.
[24:16] Life long pain, stress and depression.
[24:23] Did you want the same lifestyle for your daughter?
[24:29] Your dad was not like that.
[24:33] He used to beat me out of anger when you were little kids.
[24:39] But when you grew up he didn't beat me once.
[24:44] But why did he beat you once mom? Why?
[25:00] That shouldn't have happened once.
[25:07] I tolerated what happened to me.
[25:22] I was too young that's why I couldn't do anything.
[25:34] But I won't let that happen again.
[25:39] I want to see everyone happy and healthy.
[25:48] I won't let that happened to Kiran again.
[25:54] I will correct all my mistakes which I made in past.
[26:49] Who is there? Why are you knocking the door so loudly?
[26:56] Where is your son?
Why? What has he done?
[27:00] Shahzain.
[27:02] Hey.
Where is he hiding?
[27:04] Who is making the noise mom?
[27:09] Hey, are you in your senses?
[27:13] I want to kill you but I promised Kiran that I will control my anger. Listen to me very carefully.
[27:23] You will stay away from Kiran.
But why? She is my wife.
[27:27] She is his wife. You have only looted my sister.
[27:33] First in the name of dowry and now in the name of restaurant.
[27:37] Ask him to leave my son otherwise I will call police.
[27:40] OK, call police. We will show them medical report which clearly states that he used to torture Kiran.
[27:47] He will be defamed in his bank.
[27:51] Well, your golden bird went away now so you need your job badly.
[28:00] We have made a complete list. We want everything back which we gave you in the name of dowry.
[28:04] These curtains, sofa set, TV trolley and everything else.
[28:07] In that way, your house will be empty. Right?
[28:11] I won't spare you.
Hey.
[28:17] My sister's promise has stopped me
[28:20] otherwise I swear you wouldn't be able to stand on your feet today.
[28:29] Listen to me very carefully.
[28:33] You will stay away from Kiran. Understand?
[28:45] No jojo no.
I am taking laptop back. Uncle gave that as well.
[28:55] If you did anything wrong then I will empty your house.
[29:19] Get lost from here. I will see you. You goons.
[29:25] What will happen now?
Don't worry mom.
[29:36] Who is there Hamid?
[29:39] Hmm?
[29:49] Can I meet Fareeha?
[30:11] Farhad, I don't think that you should meet Fareeha now.
[30:23] Let him come in please.
[30:29] I also want to talk to him.
[30:33] OK.
[30:36] We are sitting in that room. Call us if required.
[30:47] She wants to meet him.
[31:17] How are you Fareeha?
[31:20] I am fine. Have you talked to Kiran?
[31:27] She has come back
[31:31] Thank God. She was in very bad condition.
[31:52] I am really embarrassed.
[31:58] Whatever happened between both of us, I couldn't handle that properly.
[32:11] I am very sorry.
[32:21] You were right that we should give ourselves some time.
[32:40] And I have got chance to think about everything.
[32:51] Fareeha you are very nice. You are very nice.
[33:00] I am a broken person.
[33:04] Who took support of his anger throughout his life just to hide his anger.
[33:18] I look good from outside but I am empty from inside.
[33:31] Fareeha I don't deserve you.
[33:39] There was a big difference between us since ever and that is there now and that will remain for ever.
[33:52] I am not only talking about class. In every way.
[34:02] In attitude and in nature.
[34:07] From heart and mind.
[34:14] So much difference in every way.
[34:18] And I have understood that there is no match between us.
[34:25] What do you want to say?
[34:42] You can take divorce Fareeha.
[34:56] I am ready to sign the documents.
[35:12] I set you free from this relation.
[35:49] What did you say to Fareeha?
[35:52]  I thought that you are going there to fix everything.
[35:58] I have fixed everything Jojo.
[36:01] What are you talking about? If both of you won't stay together then how can everything be alright?
[36:09] Can you live without her?
[36:16] It's difficult to live without Fareeha. It's very difficult.
[36:27] But I can't misbehave with her by staying with her.
[36:32] That happened once and that too by mistake.
[36:36] You didn't do that intentionally.
[36:41] But that shouldn't have happened even once Jojo.
[36:47] Honestly speaking, I am getting scared of my anger.
[36:57] I don't know what I have hid in myself.
[37:04] I don't know why I expressed anger on wrong person.
[37:20] But I can't take this risk with Fareeha's life.
[37:29] So it would be better for me to get out of her life.
[37:46] Is he considering this a joke?
[37:48] How can he say that so easily that it would be better to get divorce.
[37:52] Zara, I can't believe it.
[37:57] What is this going on with Fareeha?
[38:03] I think as if she has got effected from an evil sight.
[38:08] No, there is nothing like that. It's a result of blind love.
[38:12] But you don't know that she still loves Farhad blindly.
[38:18] But what will she get in the end? Divorce?
[38:21] Aunt, tell me how can this be a reward of love?
But Zara.
[38:26] Sorry aunt.
[38:27] This is not their love. This is hasty approach and foolishness of both of them.
[38:34] Why this has happened to my Fareeha?
Think about uncle.
[38:39] He must be in great pain. 
[38:42] First he tolerated with the humiliation when Fareeha ran away from house and now this divorce.
[38:47] His heart must have been broken. 
[38:51] He was very ambitious about Fareeha. She was his pride.
[38:57] You are right but all of this is not very easy for Fareeha as well.
[39:03] She will have to face this with great courage.
You should advise her.
[39:09] Tell her that just forget whatever happened and try to move on and secure her future.
[39:18] I will try to come in the evening.
[39:22] But ask her to make that decision from her mind instead of heart.
[39:27] OK Zara, bye.
