[00:13] Shamim look, my arms doesn't have anymore power
[00:20] my arms starts shivering after making tens of cladrons
[00:25] why did you take the money from them?
[00:29]  Farhad, aunt Shaggo gave them to me forcefully. I couldn't refuse
[00:36] couldn't you return as well? 
[00:37] what are you doing here? 
[00:41] whatever spectacle you've done, isn't that enough?
[00:46] get out of here
[01:28] I am coming in a while
[01:31] mom...
[01:44] don't you miss me?
[01:50] who misses those daughters who leaves the house after ruining their parents honor?
[01:58] So why my mother cannot say such things to me while looking into my eyes?
[02:07] didn't you miss your mother?
[02:12] didn't you think about your mother ever?
[02:17]  who can forget such a lovely mother?
[02:20] I miss you everyday
[02:28] I miss my mother, when the onions turns black instead of getting golden brown
[02:38] I miss my mother, when the kneaded flour gets hard instead of being soft
[02:42] I miss your lectures etc everything...
[02:46] mom, I miss it everyday
[03:07] I have to check on the guests
[03:09] mom
[03:13] I am also a guest now
[03:20] tell me something before going
[03:23] until when you guys will stay angry with me?
[03:34] Do I have the right to get angry, Fareeha?
[03:39] as it is, you've come to attend your aunt's wedding
[03:45] not to meet your mother
[03:47] so mom, whatever dad & brother Saqib did last time. How I would have come?
[03:54] be thankful that Saqib is not present here right now
[03:58] otherwise, all hell break would have loose
[04:04] and I have to listen to the people taunting
[04:08] neither you or Shaggo had to tolerate anything
[04:14] until when you'll put us into such trials?
[04:19] until when?
[04:26] I have to attend the guests
[04:44] Greetings aunty, how are you?
[04:47] I am fine, but you haven't done the right thing with your parents
[04:51] and what is this? A person feels happy when their daughter pays a visit to her parents house
[04:54] but here, brother Yousuf & sister Rashida are hiding their faces
[04:58] aunty, this is mine & my family's personal matter
[05:02] what is personal matter though? It has become our community's problem
[05:06] may God never gives a daughter like you
[05:08] I feel so hurt whenever I see brother Yousuf & sister Rashida
[05:11] what their status used to be, and now they try to hide their face at all times
[05:15] you are quite stubborn! You came here just like that, you should be ashamed!
[05:59] Fareeha
[06:02] come, meet Shaggo
[06:05] but...
[06:07] come
[06:52] dad
[07:01] what are you doing here as of yet?
[07:03] Hamid & Shaggo had invited you, and they've gone
[07:07] so what are you doing here?
[07:09] now don't waste my time
[07:25] sister..
[07:30] Bilal, what are you doing here?
[07:33] Come, the ceremony has ended. We have to go home as well, lets go
[07:39] Come
[07:43] Fareeha
[07:46] I'm so sorry
[07:48] I thought, everyone's heart would melt on this occasion
[07:52] No Zara...
[07:55] I have made everyone's heart so hard that nobody has any place for me anymore
[08:00] I shouldn't have come
[08:03] come, let me drop you home
[08:07] stop crying
[08:32] why you took so long to come?
Greetings!
[08:34] Greetings! I have been waiting for you since so long
[08:36] it takes time to complete the house chores
[08:38] yes
[08:39] all good? Since you were insisting a lot to visit today
[08:41] I feel like, come in
[09:01] how are you?
[09:04] absolutely fine
[09:10] how did you get injured?
[09:12] table... I am just crazy, as you say. I keep running here & there
[09:21] I was going & I got injured by the table
[09:25] you came from outside
[09:27] let me make sherbat for you
mom...
[09:33] first of all, I won't drink sherbat but only cold water
[09:36] secondly, I will take it myself. I don't like you to treat me as a guest whenever I visit
[10:03] are you happy in your in-laws house? Are you fine there?
[10:06] I am absolutely fine mom, why are you asking this again & again?
[10:10] I came from outside, look at the weather
[10:12] I got a bit of headache, what else?
[10:21] the girls have to take every step very cautiously in their in-laws house
[10:28] still they slip
[10:32] they have to breathe carefully too
[10:36] so that nobody shall mind
[10:40] no matter, if they become breathless
[10:43] and its very difficult to read a man
[10:47] he can become furious anytime
[10:51] and we get punished
[10:59] but mom
[11:01] until when? & to what extent?
[11:15] since men do hard work
[11:18] so there are many tensions
[11:21] they can raise their hand in anger
[11:25] but don't take it to your heart
[11:30] your father was quite furious though
[11:34] but see, how he took care of us
[11:42] Shahzain is also taking very good care of you
[11:49] he meets us very respectfully
[11:52] I like it
[11:56] keeping all these things aside
[12:00] tell me something
[12:03] today, if you get a chance... your entire life that you had spent
[12:11] if you get a chance to repeat your entire life
[12:16] then what will you do?
[12:18] the same thing that I did for my entire life, Kiran
[12:22] I will nurture the relations
[12:26] but... a woman's patience & tolerance is not her weakness
[12:31] instead its her strength
[12:37] today on wards, you have to take every step very carefully
[12:42] don't slip again
[12:51] Ok
[12:52] fine!
[13:08] here you go
[13:10] I had asked you to bring me the tablet of headache
[13:14] I am having a splitting headache
[13:16] you've taken so many medicines since last night
[13:18] so many medicines aren't good for health, they are harmful
[13:22] sister, these medicines aren't as harmful as your daughter's antics
[13:31] and sorry to say brother, but there is no as such medicine to remove this stain that your daughter has caused
[13:41] as it is, its a different matter that Shaggo got married in this age
[13:46] but Fareeha's presence made another spectacle
[13:51] do you know what gossips people were making yesterday?
[13:54] Juggan, whatever happened. Just be quiet
[13:58] are people making less gossips that you will also make?
[14:01] there are so many people who do gossips
[14:03] do you know, what Rani & sister Bunni was talking about yesterday?
[14:07] that maybe Fareeha's marriage didn't work out. Or maybe her husband had left her
[14:11] and there are no good end results of love marriages
[14:15] God forbid!
[14:17] sister Bunni just need a chance to gossip around
[14:20] and your daughter gave this chance to the people herself. So why don't they react?
[14:36] daughters are dear to their parents in every way, brother
[14:40] no matter if they are disobedient
[14:44] I apologize to you for Juggan's behavior, brother
[14:52] what if really...
[15:02] She will bear the consequences of her own decisions
[15:35] who came at this hour?
[15:42] mom, you!
[15:47] I came to see that how this guy had kept you like a queen
[15:59] all of a sudden?
[16:01] please come inside
[16:03] I'm sorry, I was just cleaning the house.
Come, sit
[16:12] let me bring water for you
[16:15] No dear
[16:16] tea! Let me make tea for you
[16:18] I don't want anything
[16:21] you know, we belong to that family where its forbidden to drink the water of your son-in-law's house
[16:27] mom, the time has changed now. Now the son-in-law is like a son
[16:31] and everything of a son's house is halal
[16:34] whether its food or drink
[16:36] ok, sit here
[16:38] Tell me, did your mother-in-law has accepted you as a daughter?
[16:45] did she kept you like a daughter?
[16:48] whether the words are old or new
[16:51] few truths never change
[16:54] and the biggest truth is... this guy cannot give you anything
[17:06] You could have got much better house & guy than this one
[17:15] parents never think wrong for their children
[17:20] you had left us for this?
[17:27] mom, only love...
[17:29] I had just made a mistake of falling in love
[17:34] this house.. this life...
[17:37] and this guy
[17:39] cannot give you anything
why don't you get it?
[17:45] come with me to our house right away
[17:49] I am feeling suffocated while seeing this house
[17:53] dear Fareeha, I will convince your dad & brother
[17:59] really! Will you convince dad & brother Saqib to forgive us?
[18:05] No us... only you
[18:09] even today, that guy doesn't fit in our family anywhere
[18:15] he cannot become a part of us
[18:18] but he has become a part of me, mom
[18:21] Farhad is my husband
[18:30] why do you want to miss this chance of forgiveness by doing this mistake?
[18:37] leave that guy
[18:39] before he leaves you
[18:43] why will he leave me?
[18:47] because...
[18:49] when you see the realities of life
[18:53] then you start regretting your decisions
[18:59] you guys are in such a big delusion
[19:02] that you will spend your entire life on the basis of love
[19:09] I thought, when you came on the wedding
[19:13] then you might have realized what you are missing by seeing us together
[19:23] I feel it very badly
[19:26] I feel it daily
[19:29] but what kind of a condition is this?
[19:34] I have to kill one of my part among my two parts, in what trial you are putting me into?
[19:40] and I?
[19:43] what is my fault?
[19:45] in what trial you guys have put me into?
[19:50] daily I think what a miss was there in my love & upbringing
[19:56] that my children doesn't want to live with me
[20:01] Saqib wants to leave the house as well
[20:04] I am such an unlucky mother
[20:12] I am asking you for the last time
[20:17] will you come home with me or not?
[20:24] No
[20:30] Ok!
[20:33] today onwards, I will never step inside your house
[21:32] do you want to leave me? Will you leave me so easily, answer me!
[21:36] will you leave me so easily?
[21:38]  will you leave me? 
[21:39] why do you hurt me again & again, Kiran?
[21:41] Why do you hurt me again & again!
[21:55] here you go brother, your hot drink
[22:01] by the way, why you've made your look like old times hero?
[22:03] is everything fine?
[22:06] just like that...
[22:09] I am so worried for Fareeha
[22:12] she misses her mother a lot, she stays upset at all times
[22:17] its normal, obviously she'll miss her as she is always alone
[22:22] now everyone is not stone hearted like you
[22:26] Rubbish! try to become serious sometime
[22:31] I am serious
[22:34] are you done with your rubbish?
 Can I start my rubbish now?
[22:37] let me do my rubbish first, then you can start
[22:41] why do you become so senti all of a sudden? Okay tell me
[22:49] I don't understand how to cheer her up?
[22:54] what shall I do that she becomes a bit happy?
[22:57] take her for an outing or to meet her friends
[23:02] she doesn't have friends
[23:05] do you know, she was only friends with her cousins. That's it!
[23:09] so introduce her to your friends, after all you have quite colorful ones
[23:14] always talking non-sense
[23:18] are my friends capable enough to be introduced to her?
[23:21] we've already met her
[23:24] in compulsion..
[23:26] brother, as far as I know sister-in-law. She is a chill party
[23:30] introduce her to your friends, she'll feel good
[23:33] tell me something seriously, until today I have only faced problems by your suggestions

[25:38] I feel so bad whenever I see you like this

[33:42] aren't you happy with me?
[33:48] you get upset with me, angry with me every other day on petty matters
[33:57] instead of tormenting each other...

[34:11] I will take all the responsibility, I will take the responsibility of everything. You haven't done any mistake though
[34:16] you are upset with me because of Farhad, because of the car. I agree, but I won't discuss this with anyone
[34:37] do you want to take divorce from me?

[35:28] all of their demands of the dowry were getting fulfilled there
[35:30] But no, I haven't done that
[35:34] because I was in love with you
[35:38] I have sacrificed so many things along with the car
[35:42] do you remember, what my mother had said?
[35:46] what she had said? 
I will enter the room only when I will get the car, but no!
[35:52] I haven't done that
[35:54] I took you on the bike in the entire city, whenever I wanted to
[35:59] but still I am the bad guy, you consider me as the bad guy
[36:03] I tolerated all the misbehavior of your brother, but still you consider me the bad guy
[36:12] do you want to leave me?
[36:15] do you want to leave me? Will you leave me so easily, answer me!
