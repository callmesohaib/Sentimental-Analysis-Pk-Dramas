[01:25] Mom, I'll not spare her so easily.
[01:28] So will you wear her around your neck like an amulet?
[01:30] Let her go to hell. I'll find a new girl for you.
[01:37] No. Mom..
[01:40] Its not about getting married. She has made me stubborn.
[01:44] I'll not let those two siblings get off so easily.
[01:48] And as far as Kiran is concerned,
[01:50] if I don't bring her to your feet, don't call me Shahzain.
[01:55] You're just dragging matters.
[01:57] See, someone else is teaching her. She won't listen to you now.
[02:03] Mom, you don't know.
[02:05] Sympathy is magic.
[02:08] And whoever is teaching her, I'll knock sense into them as well.
[02:12] See, I don't think you'll get something. Isn't it better you work hard for something else?
[02:19] What are you saying?
[02:21] You're spoiling my entire game.
[02:24] Now that I'm near my destination, you want me to go back.
[02:28] God knows what she told you. She's asking for a divorce and you don't understand?
[02:35] What do you want? Do you want to get your parents insulted?
[02:37] Nobody will insult you mom. Just keep watching.
[02:43] I'll now have to use other tactics.
[02:48] Don't get your hands broken, while using your tactics.
[02:52] Alright. Don't worry now. I have to go out for some work, I'll talk to you when I get back.
[02:58] This boy will never understand.
[03:19] Hello mom.
Hello. Farhad, where were you? You're so late today.
[03:26] I was working mom.
[03:28] I'm coming from the catering. Tell me how are you?
[03:33] Are you okay?
Everything is okay.
[03:35] Did you eat?
I did.
[03:36] Did you take your medicine?
I did.
[03:39] Listen.. Shahzain came.
[03:45] What?
[03:52] Why did he come here?
[03:57] Did you let him meet Kiran?
[03:59] He came unannounced. Kiran opened the door..
[04:04] He was apologizing. He even touched my feet.
[04:10] He's regretting.
[04:13] Mom, all this is a drama. He isn't regretting anything.
[04:17] You know what he's regretting? That he lost the catering business.
[04:24] No Farhad..
[04:27] I felt he was telling the truth.
[04:31] What?
[04:34] See, dear..
[04:36] However Shahzain is, he is Kiran's husband.
[04:44] We don't have divorces in our family.
[04:47] Your father isn't alive as well. How will Kiran live without her husband?
[04:55] Mom.. She might live without her husband
[04:59] but if she lives with him, she might not survive.
God forbid..
[05:05] See mom.. you'll have to decide now. Do you want a divorced daughter or a dead daughter?
[05:21] Let me ask you something, mom.
[05:25] If you had a brother and he supported you..
[05:31] And he would have told you that you wouldn't live with that person, would you have stayed with dad?
[05:40] What nonsense are you talking about your dead father?
[05:46] I'm just saying..
[05:50] The support you didn't have then.. Kiran has now.
[05:59] Mom time and circumstances have changed.
[06:03] The courage you didn't have then, women today have it.
[06:10] Kiran has it as well.
[06:13] She cannot say it because whenever she talks to you, you tell her to be patient.
[06:26] At all costs, this house is better than her husband's house.
[06:38] My sister isn't a burden on me, mom..
[07:12] Dad?
[07:20] Why is she here?
Hello brother Saqib.
[07:25] Mom and dad gave me the good news and I couldn't hold back so I came.
[07:31] Really?
[07:32] Say that when he turned you down, you came back to us.
[07:36] She is so selfish.
[07:38] Whats wrong with you?
[07:40] Can you not cool down?
Why is she here?
[07:44] I'm just here to congratulate everyone.
[07:48] See, Ramsha and I don't even want your shadow to touch our child. Understand?
[07:55] Whats wrong Saqib? What are you saying?
[07:59] I accept that she made a mistake but this doesn't mean we'll treat her like this.
[08:05] She is our daughter and she can come a hundred times.
[08:10] Tell me directly that no matter how many mistakes she makes, she'll always be your favorite.
[08:15] And I'll never be your favorite even if I do everything good.
[08:17] What are you thinking? Your misinterpreting whatever we're saying.
[08:21] Dad..
[08:26] brother Saqib is right. I shouldn't have come here.
[08:33] May you always be happy, brother Saqib. I came to give this gift.
[08:38] Accept it if you can.
[08:41] Fariha, stop. Fariha?
[08:45] Fariha? Are you happy now?
[08:48] Oh my God!
[09:34] Is this a circus going on here?
[09:37] They are called food bloggers.
[09:40] We give them money, they come to us, eat the food, make video and upload.
[09:46] People watch those videos and then come to us.
[09:51] Wow. First we pay them to eat. What is this?
[09:56] This will earn us a loss.
[09:58] There will be no loss. This is marketing. Put it in the marketing budget.
[10:05] Farhad? Is this marketing?
[10:10] Isn't marketing the age old technique of printing pamphlets and distributing everywhere.
[10:18] Time has changed, Munshi..
[10:22] Farhad, you're talking about spending money.
[10:27] And, he's saying that we don't have money.
[10:34] Please keep faith.
[10:37] The dessert will be as sweet as the amount of sugar we put in.
[10:41] What are they doing here?
[10:43] Welcome to Karim Baksh and Caterers. I'm your friend Jojo and this is my friend, Mr. Farhad.
[10:52] Hello.
[10:53] You'll find the best biryani, nihari, korma, karhai, hot flat breads and many more.
[11:02] If you eat once, you'll come back for more. This will become your favorite place. I promise.
[11:08] I'll make you meet my team. This is brother Shamshad.
[11:13] Shamshad.. say something.
[11:16] I don't speak much. I cook and make people eat.
[11:19] Wow. Amazing Shamshad.. He has magic in his hands.
[11:26] Like our page and follow it to stay updated.
[11:30] Come here and try the food. You'll love it.
[11:34] This is me, your friend Jojo, signing out from Karim Baksh Caterers, bye.
[11:38] This is very wrong, Shabbo.
[11:43] Brother Yousuf should have talked to Saqib first and then take Fariha home.
[11:48] Whats the problem?
[11:50] If brother Yousuf had taken Fariha back..
[11:55] Saqib didn't have to make such a big mess. It was unnecessary.
[12:01] But Fariha gave them the opportunity to do all this.
[12:06] Don't advocate for Saqib.
[12:09] I'm not advocating for anyone, aunt.
[12:12] I'm just saying that whatever happened, nobody was at fault.
[12:17] If nobody is at fault,
[12:20] then why is Fariha, paying alone for all this?
[12:24] Is it because, she,
[12:28] was forced by her heart and did all this.
[12:31] Even though Fariha's heart forced her to do all this,
[12:35] but see that brother Saqib is forced by his own rules.
[12:39] You two should stop arguing.
[12:44] There should be some margin given to blood relations.
[12:48] You're right.
[12:51] But we will need time to mend this gap.
[12:58] Shaboo, did you call Fariha and ask her if she's back home. Where is she?
[13:03] Yes. I tried her phone.
[13:07] But she doesn't tell me anything. She said she'd go home in a while.
[13:13] So she must be thinking you don't know what happened and made an excuse.
[13:19] Should I call?
No
[13:22] Don't call her again and get her worried.
[13:26] She might want to be alone for a while.
[13:31] Maybe she'll return when she feels better.
[13:36] Yes. She needs to understand this matter with a calm mind.
[13:42] If she makes a bad decision this time, she'll be in a loss.
[15:04] Hello?
Hello Kiran? Why aren't you taking my calls?
[15:09] Why? What is there to talk about?
[15:16] How many times should I apologize?
[15:18] Do you want me to fall to your feet and apologize, I'll do that.
[15:22] But why are you doing all this?
[15:26] Really?
[15:30] Am I doing everything?
[15:35] Its about me, Shahzain..
[15:41] Whatever you did with me..
[15:45] Its not easy.
[15:46] I know Kiran. I know. I made a big mistake. I did wrong with you.
[15:52] Kiran.. I listened to mom..
[15:57] And I couldn't handle the pressure of marriage.
[16:00] I know I wronged you. I'm the worst.
[16:09] And I was late to care for you.
[16:13] See Kiran, whatever it is. We're married and its not a joke.
[16:23] We should work on it. I'll work on myself. Just give me a chance. One chance.
[16:33] No. I don't have the courage Shahzain.
[16:38] I'll be your courage Kiran. I'm with you.
[16:44] But its my turn now. I'll fix everything. Give me one chance, Kiran.
[16:52] I know Kiran, some bad moments have made our good moments go fade.
[16:57] But think yourself Kiran.. we were not always like this.
[17:02] Everything can go back to how it was. Give me one chance Kiran.
[17:06] I'll make you very happy.
[17:12] Kiran, if you don't forgive me,
[17:16] I'll finish myself.
No. No Shahzain. No.. Shazain..
[17:23] Get a grip on yourself. Don't like this.
I won't. I don't want to live this life.
[17:30] If you don't forgive me, how will I forgive myself. So isn't it better if I finish myself
[17:36] Shahzain! No.
[17:41] Relax. Okay? Get back to your senses. No.
[17:50] So then tell me you'll not talk about the divorce. You'll give me another chance?
[17:57] Please Kiran.. You can at least do this much for me. To save our relationship.
[18:05] Just give me one chance Kiran.
[18:09] I'll think about it. Let me think. I'll tell you then, Shahzain..
[18:18] Thank you Kiran. Thank you so much. I love you. I really love you.
[18:26] I'll talk to you later. Relax..
[19:52] Farhad, you're amazing.
[19:58] Its all of our hard work.
Thats true.
[20:03] It gets difficult to bring back customers if they leave once.
[20:08] And they didn't.
[20:11] What do you mean?
[20:12] They are all new customers. The old ones aren't back.
[20:18] Customer is a customer. What is new and old?
[20:22] As it is, we're not looking back. We're looking ahead.
[20:25] Old customers are loyal. A new customer comes to try out a new thing for a while,
[20:32] But then they leave once they're done.  What if..
[20:37] No Shamshad..
[20:39] These old customers were also new customers once. 
[20:43] We'll work hard on them. Don't worry.
[20:50] Alright. I'll go and lock the kitchen.
[21:49] 1500.. 30, 830.. How much altogether?
[21:55] Please come in. What do you want?
[22:02] We're not here to listen to anybody. Listen to us. Leave this shop with respect.
[22:07] Do you understand? If we come back again, we'll not give you a chance. Instead we'll drive you out ourselves.
How..
[22:15] Quiet. You'll empty this shop. That's it.
Move your hand. Be careful.
[22:21] We need this shop empty tomorrow. Not a single person should be here or else we won't spare anything.
[22:28] Understood?!
[23:09] Fariha? Fariha?
What happened Shaboo aunty?
[23:13] Brother Yousuf is in the hospital.
What? Why?
[23:18] There were some people at the shop. They hit him. He's injured.
[23:23] Oh God. Lets go.
[23:31] There's an injury on the head and he has lost a lot of blood.
[23:35]  His condition is critical.
[23:40] Everything will be alright. 
[23:43] Brother Yousuf is very tough. These cowards cannot harm him.
[23:51] Don't worry.
I just hope he gets better.
[23:58] But.. I don't understand why did this happen and how?
[24:05] Bad luck had to renter our lives.
[24:09] Saqib how did this happen?
[24:12]  Brother Yousuf has a full security system in his shop.
[24:16] There is CCTV and there's a guard as well. 
[24:19] How could everybody come in while all of these were there?
[24:24] And nobody saw anything. How is this possible?
[24:27] I don't understand.
[24:30] How could someone dare?
[24:33] You should go and check the footage at brother Yousuf's shop.
[24:38] I'll keep giving you updates here. 
[24:41] And whoever did this with brother Yousuf, I'll not spare them.
[25:15] Who are you calling again and again?
[25:19] Fareeha's missed call.
[25:21] So why did you miss it?
I didn't know she'd call.
[25:25] Put up custom ring tone on her number. Loud and rowdy. 
[25:31] In fact, have an alarm system.
[25:33] If she calls, a red light shines bright.
[25:36] You'll give me out of the world options. What should we do now?
[25:38] What can we do? Try again.
[26:05] I think she dialed by mistake. 
[26:09] She isn't answering.
[26:14] Mom's calling. 
[26:18] Yes mom?
[26:22] I'm coming. Yes.
[26:28] I have to take her to a therapist.
Did aunt agree?
[26:33] For now, yes. Lets see.
God have mercy on the doctor.
[26:41] I'll leave now.
[26:43] Keep an eye on your phone.
[26:53] You'll have to arrange blood from the blood bank. He has lost a lot of blood.
[26:57] Alright. I'll go and see.
Your hospital doesn't have blood?
[27:01] His blood group is O negative and its not available in the hospital right now.
[27:06] Thank you. I'll go and check.
Hurry up.
[27:55] Hello. We have an appointment for Mrs. Shamim Baksh.
I'll check.
[28:04] Yes. Where is the patient?
[28:06] She's in the waiting area.
[28:09] Alright. Ask her to wait. I'll call her.
Okay. Thank you.
[28:27] Shaboo.. where are they? Its very late.
They're here.
[28:38] What happened, Hamid?
Rashida.. we've been told about a place. I'm going there.
[29:13] Saqib, how are you?
Hello?
[29:18] Did you send people to my dad's shop?
So this means he has agreed.
[29:24] He's in the hospital in critical condition
[29:28] I told them they just had to scare him.
[29:32] I think it was too much.
Have you lost your mind?
[29:37] I told him, we were trying to make him understand with love or else..
[29:41] Who does this with family? You're memons. From our community and you're doing this?!
[29:47] Saqib, we just have temporary bonds in business. Work is work. 
[29:53] Now understand what we're trying to tell you. This was just a trailer.
[31:00] We have had three four surgeries for O negative. We don't have the blood available. 
[31:05] The family is worried.
[31:09] We have been telling them that we need O negative blood in excess but they don't hear us.
[31:15] The patients have been suffering and we get abuses hurled at us.
[31:24] Isn't it a little hot in here?
[31:28] Drink this cold water.
[31:34] Doctor, I need to tell you that I'm here because my son insisted.
[31:42] I don't have any psychiatric illness.
Didn't you want to come here yourself?
[31:51] What will I do? Coming here? 
[31:54] Should I tell you all my family secrets? You're a stranger.
[31:59] This is wrong.
[32:03] Excuse me, madam.
Yes?
[32:06] I'm O negative.
[32:10] Will you donate blood?
[32:12] Yes. Why not? If my blood donation can save someone's life, why not.
[32:17] Alright. Come fast.
[32:19] Mam.. will it hurt?
[32:28] So, is there anyone in your family or friends whom you can share your heart with?
[32:36] My kids.. They've grown up. They're sensible and..
[32:45] as it is, once married, we don't have friends. Homes,
[32:54] housewives..
[33:03] Did you have friends before you got married?
[33:07] A lot of them and I was an extrovert.
[33:11] We would go to the markets everyday. Eat Gol Gappas and visit fairs.
[33:21] So why did you stop meeting them after you got married?
[33:26] Such things don't suit a married woman.
[33:36] My husband didn't like it.
[33:41] He used to say that going out, calling friends home or meeting them,
[33:48] it was equivalent to wasting time. He said it was best to focus on family and home.
[33:58] He was right.
So, what do you like?
[34:06] I mean.. what makes you happy? Your kids?
[34:12] Or maybe something else. It should be related to you.
[34:18] Its been years.
[34:22] I never thought about my happiness. As it is once we're married,
[34:30] women don't think about their happiness. 
[34:34] They think about their family.
[34:37] Its a right of every human being to be happy.
[34:41] Our society locks up women in boxes. Mothers, daughters, wives, daughter in laws..
[34:48] They lose themselves. 
[34:51] We make them believe that if she values herself first, she'll be selfish.
[34:59] But its not the case. When a woman is happy herself. When she thinks about her life first, 
[35:06] only then she'll be able to give something to someone else.
[35:16] I valued my family 100%. I gave everything to them. Love and respect.
[35:24] And I never showed them or told them what was in my mind.
[35:31] Of course. That is why you're here today.
[35:35] The pain you have hidden, is still fresh. 
[35:40] They have become unhealed wounds and they're hurting you.
[35:47] Nothing changes in a day. You should be happy that you came here.
[35:53] People think if we hide our pain in front of the world, it means we're strong.
[35:59]  But its not true. In fact, its the opposite.
[36:04] It is important to express and share your emotions. That is the real strength.
[36:13] A person should handle his emotions, his anger, his frustration, his anxieties.
[36:23] When you learn to manage everything, you'll understand what else is there in the world. 
[36:31] And how you can be happy.
[36:53] You haven't eaten anything since morning. Your blood pressure will fall down.
[37:03] Shaboo I'm not hungry. I don't want anything.
[37:07] But how can this work? You have to be strong.
[37:15] What will happen to us? 
[37:18] I'm going to get you something to eat and I won't hear a word.
[37:29] I wanted to tell you that we've arranged blood
[37:34] Really?
[37:35] Thank God. Are they back?
[37:39] No. We found a doner in the hospital.
[37:42] God sent an angel for you.
[37:46] Can I meet him? I want to thank him.
Please come. I'll take you.
[38:00] Are you afraid of the needle?
[38:03] No. Not the needle. 
[38:07] The blood makes me anxious.
[38:13] Relax and get some rest.
[38:40] He's there.
[38:50] He donated the blood?
[38:51] Yes. You can meet him if you want.
[39:02] Nobody should know who donated blood. 
[39:06] Write it on the file and the information will stay confidential.
[39:16] Don't you want to meet him? Do you know him?
[39:20] Its our personal matter.
[39:24] Just understand that my family and this boy shouldn't know anything.
