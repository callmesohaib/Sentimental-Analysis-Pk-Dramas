[00:16] I need malpura (sweet pancake) in dessert 
[00:18] what?
[00:23] Malpura?
[00:28] don't you know about it?
[00:32] Sir, you can pay whatever is easy for you
 its no problem even if you don't pay
[00:39] and I found Ms. Freeha quite wise 
[00:43] there is no question of making her a fool
[00:47] how do you know Freeha? 
[00:51] I haven't said anything wrong 
[00:53] but you've talked in a wrong manner!
[00:56] you cannot apologize... 
[00:59] but you do want your sister's engagement to be called off due to your ego, right?
[01:10] hurry up, the catering guys are here 
[01:13] so, what's there to worry about? 
[01:15] the matter is worrisome, because they met brother Saqib
[01:20] brother Saqib?
yes!
[01:24] lets go!
[01:26] Sir, don't take any tension. You won't have any sort of complaint
[01:38] what happened to you?
[01:38] Nothing!
[01:41] correct the bill then send me
[01:44] wait here, & keep an eye on them
[01:47] ok, brother Saqib
[01:55] what happen, are you feeling constipated?
[01:57] don't talk rubbish!
[01:59] move, brother Saqib's boot-licker!
[02:01] to whom you are calling with this name?
[02:03] you bald person, I've said to you whom else?
are you guys done?
[02:10] Maqsood, go inside & tell everyone that event planners are here to check the area
[02:15] brother Saqib had asked me to keep an eye on both of them
[02:18] Fine, you can keep an eye on them later. But first go & inform everyone. Go!
[02:23] No
[02:24] you'll understand once I'll give you a tight slap. Go!
[02:30] Okay, but you guys shall remember one thing. I have my eyes on you!
[02:36] understand?
[02:42] hi!
[02:44] I hope brother Saqib haven't said anything inappropriate to you guys
[02:51] No no, not at all!
[02:53] he was asking about discount, I said it will be done. No problem
[02:57] he was ready to do the event free of cost as well
[03:00] No no! why free of cost? Not at all
[03:06] I hope you haven't said anything about the accident
[03:10] which accident?
[03:11] nothing
[03:13] No no... 
[03:17] why you're wearing such a bright red color shirt in the scorching heat?
it feels as if he is burning in hell fire
[03:22] Billu!
[03:27] its very nice
[03:31] let me show you the area
[03:34] Sure
[03:36] I had told you, its a rubbish idea
[03:38] but she said "very nice"
[03:39] leave it!
[03:42] confidence... confidence!
[03:46] shall we?
yes yes
[03:49] you've made a gym at your house?
Nice, let me train you here
[03:53] oh bro, I am not in a mood. You know.. 
[03:56] one needs to make up their mood, you have a wedding in your house. How come you stay so chubby!
[04:01] lets make your abs, come on
[04:03] try to understand
[04:04] are you his cousin?
He is my brother
[04:06] oh so you are his sister! So, he would be needing your moral support by saying "one more time". Come on
[04:11] yes, that's fine
[04:13] you guys may go
[04:20] your house is very beautiful
[04:22] thank you! this is my world's favorite place
[04:26] no matter wherever I go, I miss my house so much after a week's time
[04:30] my world becomes tasteless infront of its affection
[04:35] really?
[04:38] you are so lucky
[04:39] why? Don't you like your house?
[04:44] neither I like it, nor I dislike it
[04:47] it just seems desolate
[04:49] is your family small?
[04:51] No no, the family is quite big but.. 
[04:59] but there is loneliness in the crowd as well, right?
[05:03] I know what you mean. I know
[05:05] even my family is very big, but everyone is so close
[05:09] and they are into everyone's personal space so much, that sometimes I feel so suffocated
[05:14] then I leave my house & hide here, at the rooftop
[05:18] sit down
[05:32] what else do you do?
[05:37] I listen to songs
[05:39] I talk to myself a lot
[05:41] and the sunset view is really beautiful here, I enjoy that too
[05:46] I do deep breathing, and calm myself down
[05:49] and then go back to my family once again
[05:51] and you get relax by doing all this?
[05:55] yes
[05:57] I must say, you shall try this once
[05:59] if it didn't work, then I'll return your money
[06:05] I have to return the money though... 
[06:08] your brother didn't like my quotation
[06:13] I'm so sorry, don't mind his words
[06:17] by the way, your brother seems quite strict
[06:22] he is
[06:26] are you afraid?
[06:27] No... 
[06:29] why would I be afraid?
[06:31] I am... 
I'm
[06:33] fine?
[06:39] Okay, put this discussion aside
this is your canvas
[06:42] you have to decorate it
[06:45] and remember one thing, Zara is not only my cousin but my sister
[06:50] in fact, she is my most favorite person in this world
[06:53] this evening should be memorable for her, in fact it should be special
[06:59] it will be, I promise!
[07:14] then?
[07:19] then what?
[07:29] from where this noise is coming?
[07:34] nothing happened
[07:36] what have you done with him?
[07:37] his muscle got pulled, let me fix it right away
[07:41] ouch! 
I had told you not to make him do such exercises
[07:43] I thought, he'll be able to do it
[07:45] Billu!
[07:46] hey, what are you doing?
[07:49] it was just bench press
[07:52] what was the need to make him do such kind of exercise?
[07:54] I thought, he'll be able to do it
[07:56] lets go! get up & don't do it again
[08:01] come with me
[08:04] don't know which 6 packs fashion is trending nowadays! You look good however you are
[08:08] don't get into all such useless things next time
[08:13] let me give them the pain killer
[08:17] quickly go! 
don't take tension, they'll manage
[08:22] small injuries do happen in such cases
[08:25] please come
[08:39] here... 
[08:41] we'll put the fairy lights here, from above
[08:46] you couldn't decide that what kind of a function shall be done, right?
[08:50] it will look as if there are stars in the sky at night time
[08:55] I didn't thought that it will be possible
[08:58] but nice
[09:00] you've said the words of my heart
[09:03] I will always keep doing
[09:05] I mean, I will keep fulfilling all of your requests
[09:09] after all, its my work
[09:13] you talk so much!
[09:16] not with everyone
[09:18] hmm... everyone says the same thing
[09:21] everyone?
[09:23] whom else you've injured from your bike?
[09:26] hey! only one
[09:32] it means, I am special?
[09:37] shall we talk about work?
[09:40] look at the garden
[09:41] its uneven from some places, & there are small holes in between
[09:45] So be careful, what if any accident happens
[10:35] hey! red shirt guy
[10:39] what is happening here? Who are you?
[10:41] aunt Shaggo, I had told you that catering guys had to come. So they are here
[10:45] So, put the tents. Instead you guys are doing a cheap scene
[10:49] actually I slipped, so he had helped me
[10:55] hmm... as if you were falling from the 8th floor
[11:00] no aunty, actually... 
[11:01] move back... 
[11:04] I need you on one arm distance
[11:09] he is flirting in the full day light. Oh God save us, look at his shirt
[11:14] aunty please... 
[11:18] couldn't you find any other catering guy?
[11:21] Don't you dare to make him do the exercise ever again!
[11:25] I shall not see you again
what's happening here?
[11:28] lets go, our work is done
[11:30] lets go, come
[11:32] this item is also with him?
[11:36] I think we should leave now, right?
[11:38] bye!
bye!
[11:44] Sorry man, how would I know that he'll become unstable in the warm up?
[11:52] besides, his sister scolds a lot
[11:55] what's my mistake, why are you angry at me?
[12:12] sit down
[12:13] couldn't you find anyone else?
[12:15] let me call Memon Kebab House right away, they'll do such an amazing arrangement
[12:19] but get rid of them
[12:22] aunt Shaggo please, let me handle it
[12:29] as if you'll be able to handle
[12:35] Kiran
[12:37] Kiran
[12:39] yes dad
[12:41] I wanted to talk to you
[12:45] yes
[12:48] I had a word with Shahzain's father
[12:51] Okay, all good?
[12:52] I agree, that day Farhad's way of talking was wrong
[12:57] but he wasn't wrong
[13:00] even I was quite worried about the same thing since so long
[13:03] so I had talked to him clearly as well
[13:08] they said, now they won't talk about any dowry or so. And the wedding date is fixed for this month
[13:12] really? Are you telling the truth?
[13:15] do we joke with each other?
[13:17] No, we don't
[13:20] its such a good thing then
[13:23] now quickly go & bring me a cup of tea
[13:26] let me prepare a best cup of tea for you
[13:28] where is the remote?
its there, on the sofa
[13:32] on which sofa?
[13:35] let watch this
[14:22] what's the matter?
[14:24] I should be asking this from you
[14:26] why are you talking so weird?
[14:28] look here
yes
[14:33] now I've understood that why are you so excited about this function
[14:39] hey look... 
[14:40] if this function is disliked by everyone then I must say, lets cancel it
[14:44] Fine! so I am canceling this function
[14:49] why are you agreeing with me?
[14:51] who am I? Its not my wedding but yours
[14:54] why will you cancel the function? 
It shouldn't be canceled at all!
[14:58] then tell me honestly, what's going on between you & that guy?
[15:03] I know its not only catering matter, you know him prior right?
[15:07] why are you doing so many questions from me?
[15:10] I haven't done anything wrong. It feels as if I am being questioned for no reason
[15:14] because I feel as if you are hiding something from me
[15:21] if I will tell you, then swear upon my life that you won't tell anything to anyone
[15:26] I know a lot of your weird stuff, have I ever said anything to anyone that I will tell this?
[15:31] tell me
[15:33] Okay... do you remember, we had gone to the tailor master that day to pick up your dress 
[15:41] we had an accident over there
[15:45] the poor guy had reached to the hospital
[15:47] it was about to become a police case
oh my God! police case?
[15:52] yes, but the guy is naive that's why he didn't said anything
[15:55] I had gone to him to apologize
[15:58] then?
then everything went well
[16:01] then I got to know that he has a catering business
[16:04] I thought, my work will be done
[16:06] I was feeling so guilty & at that time he was in quite a lot of pain
[16:12] but Freeha, what if anyone gets to know about it then?
[16:15] why anyone will get to know?
[16:17] Crazy girl! people run away after doing robbery
[16:21] and you've called him back to our house
[16:23] this case will be opened once again
[16:25] No! nothing as such will happen. He is such a nice person
[16:31] Freeha, I hope you don't have any other plans in your mind with that guy
[16:38] No... not at all! Are you mad?
[16:42] no no.. 
[16:47] by the way, he is very cute
[16:51] get back to your senses, Freeha
[16:54] don't ever imagine any such kind of dream even by mistake
[16:57] this is Moti Palace
[16:59] people don't fall in love over here
[17:03] here, people make the matches on the ground 
[17:06] and that too in the same community
[17:09] so, it would be better for you to come back to the ground
[17:14] Fine! I know.. 
[17:17] he is good looking guy
[17:19] Can't I even appreciate?
[17:22] Fine, then put a blindfold on my eyes
[17:26] don't just put a blindfold on your brains!
[17:30] got it?
[18:05] oho, a lot of work is still left
[18:09] what have you done to yourself?
[18:11] its a wedding house & there is plenty of work to do
[18:14] I had told you to do some exercises at home & keep your mouth shut
[18:18] only then you'll loose weight
[18:21] Weird, don't know what madness is this
[18:24] he'll do the exercise! Now your muscles are pulled
[18:27] I'll be fine, as it is small injuries do happen to athletes
[18:31] hmm... very big athlete.
get up & call everyone for dinner
[18:34] I?
[18:35] yes, you. Come on get up, hurry up!
[18:45] do you know, its my daughter's wedding
[18:48] I have gathered it for her
[18:50] it might not be of lacs but...
I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
[18:57] if you also have a daughter
[19:00] then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
[19:03] I think...
[19:05] there is nobody in this world except for you
[19:29] hello!
[19:32] yesterday, I saw you sitting on the bench
[19:35] maybe you had forgotten your notebook
[19:37] you took my notebook!
[19:40] No, I tried searching for you but I couldn't find you.
 So, I had kept it with me for the safety
[19:45] where is my notebook?
[19:47] its lying in my car. As I can't do the jogging while holding it
[19:52] Come with me. Its lying in the car, let me give it to you
[19:54] I understand all!
[19:55] what?
[19:56] yes...
What?
[19:57] what is this?
Can't a girl walk on the track all alone?
[20:01] I know everything! 
You want me to sit in your car by making an excuse
[20:04] you are taking me wrong. What are you saying?
[20:07] what I am saying? let me tell you
[20:10] You are flirting with me while considering me alone
[20:12] I will make noise if you try to become free with me
[20:14] you are already making noise, I haven't made any
[20:17] please come, its lying in the car.
Ouch!
[20:26] do you have water?
[20:29] is this water?
[20:32] that man was trying to do flirt with me, but I have sprayed a pepper pray on him
[20:35] go check on him, hurry up!
[20:37] don't you worry, let me go & check
Ok
[20:43] next time he'll think ten times before flirting with any girl
[20:49] the women of that house are dangerous, the kids are dangerous... 
[20:52] and their men are more dangerous!
[21:01] what are you doing?
I'm waking you up!
[21:05] brother, they are such a dangerous family
[21:07] Don't do this! 
[21:09] I swear upon God. Until I was inside their house, I thought I will never be able to come outside
[21:13] oh brother, her cousin has scolded me so much in those 5 minutes that even my parents haven't scolded me that much in my entire life 
[21:20] I'm sorry to say, but I didn't find sister-in-law's behavior right as well
[21:25] I already had a doubt
[21:27] and her brother, the mustache guy! Did you see him?
[21:30] the actual terror is of him
[21:38] are you even listening to me?
[21:40] hello!
Mister!
[21:48] oh brother, are you listening to me?
[21:55] hello!
[22:00] you'll only do the same thing for which I will stop you
[22:03] right?
[22:09] oh brother... 
[22:12] your brother is gone now!
[22:25] what is all this?
[22:26] I had been gathering a few things for Kiran from sometime
[22:29] I can't believe that day is here
[22:34] may God bless my daughter with a really good fate
[22:37] even I have gathered some gold. So, I am thinking to go tomorrow & get its jewelry made
[22:42] and it will be good to go in the wedding
[22:47] it will be good
[22:48] my friend has given me an address of a jeweler
[22:51] I am going to visit his shop
[22:53] Okay
[23:16] Greetings!
[23:18] how are you?
All thanks to God!
[23:21] show me this set
[23:31] its so beautiful, what's its price?
[23:33] its of 20 lacs.
So expensive!
[23:35] yes uncle, look at the gold's price. Its sky rocketing nowadays
[23:39] yes, true that
[23:41] I have some jewelry, kindly tell me its cost first then I will see something
[23:50] Ok, let me check
[23:56] bring my spectacles...
[24:04] you!
you?
[24:07] what are you doing here?
[24:09] its my shop! Who allowed him to enter?
[24:12] is your photograph pasted outside that we'll get to know that its your shop?
[24:16] if I had known that its the shop of an arrogant man like you, then I would have never entered
[24:20] We don't keep such kind of jewelry
[24:23] so its better for you to leave with your leftover respect
[24:39] such an arrogance is not good
[24:42] you might be a rich guy
[24:44] you might have abundant wealth
[24:46] but don't forget that we are also respectable people
[24:51] haven't you forgotten humanity while weighing gold?
[24:57] do you know, its my daughter's wedding
[25:00] I have gathered it for her
[25:03] it might not be of lacs but... 
[25:05] I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
[25:10] if you also have a daughter
[25:13] then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
[25:15] be quiet & don't try to give me lecture
[25:18] I know what kind of a person you are!
[25:21] now don't waste our time & get out
[25:23] He shall not come to our shop again, oust him
[25:26] bring my spectacles
[27:20] think about it! Why are you taking me to the don's house?
[27:24] you can come if you want to but don't eat my brain
[27:27] sit down
[27:35] where are you guys going after getting so dressed-up?
[27:38] dad, we are going on a function
[27:41] I had mixed the rice cauldron, Shamshad will deliver them
[27:44] No, actually we have to look after a few more arrangements too. The lights etc.. 
[27:48] but we don't do that
[27:50] dad, the client had specially requested
[27:54] So, we thought to check it ourselves
[27:57] and you didn't bothered asking me!
[28:00] dad, since it was a small work so we didn't think of bothering you
[28:03] besides, it was my first function so I thought to look after it myself
[28:09] uncle, relax! The boy will handle, he is grown up!
[28:13] As it is, he has to handle the kitchen in the future too. Right?
[28:18] everything should be done perfectly. Our kitchen's name shouldn't be ruined
[28:22] yes dad, don't you worry
[28:24] it would be ruined if we would have taken your kitchen's name
[28:27] what?
[28:28] No, nothing!
[28:31] dad, you shall rest. We are leaving. Ok?
[28:34] Bye!
[28:38] such a high sense of hearing, man!
[29:03] hey you!
[29:05] what is this? Fix it
[29:07] I'm telling you, there shouldn't be any issue
[29:09] brother, here comes your musical instrument
[29:11] oh wow!
[29:13] listen! have you arranged the cutlery?
[29:17] but I haven't brought the knife
[29:19] I'm telling you I will kill you! They don't eat rice & lentils with their hands like we do
[29:22] Ok fine, let me arrange it. I'm just coming in 2 minutes
[29:26] hey man, come here. Hold it
[29:28] keep it properly over here, and please do the work
[29:33] Shamshad

[29:35] will the cauldrons be delivered on time?
yes, they will
[29:37] what about Malpura (dessert)?

[29:41] Listen, if the dinner won't be piping hot then I will set you straight
[29:44] as I said, the food will be delivered!
[29:47] what is wrong with these lights?
[29:49] Every work needs to be done here our self!
[29:52] nobody wants to do the proper work, all are slackers!
[31:43] everything is perfect!
[31:46] really!
[31:48] everything is perfect!

[34:34] Farhad
[34:35] what's the matter?
Jojo was telling me that its an urgent matter
[34:39] is everything fine?
[34:41] I hope there isn't any issue of Malpura (dessert) otherwise, my family will kill me!
[34:45] SShh.... 
[34:46] be quiet
[35:12] I've gathered the courage with a lot of difficulty
[35:15] maybe, I won't be able to say it again
[35:26] Freeha
[35:31] I... 
[35:39] I have fallen in love with you
[35:51] I don't know what happens to me after seeing you
[35:56] It feels... 
[35:59] there is nobody in this world except for you
[36:06] maybe I've become crazy but... 
[36:09] seriously.. 
[36:14] I love you!
[36:30] brother Saqib!
