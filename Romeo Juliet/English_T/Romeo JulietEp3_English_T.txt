[02:04] You have an appointment with the doctor at 12 noon tomorrow. Don't forget.
[02:12] What are you thinking? No excuses.
[02:15] I want to meet Farhad.
[02:18] What? Why?
[02:22] I cannot see Fariha's condition.
[02:27] Whatever it is, he's her husband.
[02:31] Have you forgotten what he has done?
Everything is changing Rashida.
[02:36] The place where the story started, the place we were at, circumstances have changed.
[02:42] We have changed.
[02:44] I won my children back after losing them.
[02:50] I now stand proud.
[02:54] I don't want to be stubborn and affect my childrens' lives.
[03:03] Yes but, if Saqib sees Farhad, he'll become very angry
[03:08] We'll see to it when it happens.
[03:11] Right now I want to meet the boy who brought tears in my daughter's eyes.
[03:22] If things reach the point of divorce, they are given time for that.
[03:27] I won't make a mistake this time. I'll think first.
[03:32] Alright. I'll think about everything carefully.
[03:45] Can I sit here?
[03:47] Sit down. You've never asked me earlier.
[03:53] Are you alright?
Yes. Why?
[03:57] Because you were in a similar condition earlier. I had Farhad now.
[04:02] Ever since he has come in your life, he has been hurting you.
[04:06] But whenever you're with him, you're the happiest.
[04:12] I want to hit him. So irritating. Do you want to talk to him? Should I make you talk?
[04:20] No. This time nobody is stopping me to talk to him. I just can't do it myself.
[04:27] And maybe he doesn't want to do it either.
[04:30] Alright. If love hurts so much, I'll break up with my girlfriend.
[04:35] I don't want to take depression medicines.
[04:37] You don't need to take depression medicine. You can have ice creams.
[04:41] Do you want some? I'll have some too. Lets go.
[04:52] Farhad.. how did all this happen?
[04:58] I don't understand. They're the same people.
[05:03] They're working with the same method.
[05:08] God knows where the problem is. I don't understand.
[05:14] There are people outside the catering house. They're demanding answers.
[05:18] Alright. What should we do now?
[05:25] Shamshad has gone with the food sample to the laboratory.
[05:29] We'll soon find out what the problem was.
[05:32] I'm telling you, something was mixed in the food. I checked everything myself.
[05:37] Everything was fine. Nothing was spoiled. Each and every spice is fresh.
[05:41] Who did it? Who could do it?
[05:48] Who is it at this hour? God, let everything be alright.
[06:02] Can I come in?
Yes. Please come in.
[06:18] Hello.
Hello.
[06:23] This is Fariha's dad.
[06:29] Hello.
Hello.
[06:33] Please come. Sit down.
[06:34] I'll get water..
No..
[06:37] Water is fine.
[06:44] I wanted to talk to you.
[06:47] About Fariha.
[06:53] What happened to Fariha? Is everything alright?
[06:56] Yes Fariha is alright.
[07:00] See, I wasn't happy about your relationship.
[07:07] Neither was your family but still you people got married.
[07:16] Now whether we accept it or not, what difference does it make. The relationship exists.
[07:22] Then you talked to Fariha about divorce.
[07:27] I don't want my daughter to spend her entire life waiting for someone.
[07:33] She cannot gather the courage to take a decision.
[07:41] Do you still want to divorce her?
[07:46] Oh.. where are you barging in?
Who is Farhad?
[07:54] Yes. Its me.
[07:56] So you feed people spoilt food at your restaurant?
[08:01] There is a misunderstanding.
Enough.
[08:03] Someone is planning against us.
[08:06] There has been an FIR against him. He's going in for long.
[08:10] He's very stubborn. Take him along Shehzad.
[08:16] Brother...
[08:38] I'll come back later. Bye.
[08:48] We'll do something. Don't worry.
Don't worry.
[08:54] Farhad is coming back.
I'll go and see. I'll find out.
[08:58] Mom? Farhad is coming back. Nothing is wrong.
Dear, take care. I'll go and see.
[09:08] I told you not to go there. Have you seen now? Are you satisfied?
[09:17] See, that family has a lot of problems.
[09:22] The boy must be nice but why do you need to push your daughter there?
[09:28] Shaboo was telling me that he has already gone to jail because he picked a fight.
[09:34] What?
[09:35] Yes and you should see for yourself. Again he's involved with the police.
[09:40] His restaurant has been sealed and there are so many other problems.
[09:44] Why do you need to send your daughter there?
[09:48] I'd say, don't even mention it to Fariha.
[09:51] She'll become emotional without any reason.
[09:55] I think you should get the divorce deed made soon and be rid of all this chaos.
[10:08] Sir, there is a misunderstanding. We don't know how this happened.
[10:13] Sir, we've been in the catering business for long.
[10:17] We have respect here and trust us, this has never happened before. And even today,
[10:24] we took care of each and everything before the food was cooked. How did this happen?
[10:32] Are you talking about Kareem Baksh Pakwaan Centre.
Yes sir. Yes.
[10:38] Oh.. you two are here. This is amazing. Ever since Mr. Yaqoob passed away,
[10:44] his son is intent upon destroying whatever was left of his business.
[10:48] Oh no, sir. No.
[10:50] Our son is working with a lot of responsibility.
[10:54] Yes we can see that.
[10:56] We have 25 complaints against him and some people are in the hospital.
[11:00] Sir, you should go forward with your investigation.
[11:04] Whoever has done this with us, we want to get hold of that wretched man.
[11:10] We'll support you throughout.
[11:12] And who is he sitting there?
No sir. No.
[11:17] He isn't the one. This is our family business. We'll never cheat ourselves.
[11:22] He looks like a thug from his face and on top of that his antics aren't good either.
[11:25] Khuda Baksh, put him in the lock up.
[11:28] And you, please arrange for a lawyer. This case will stretch now.
[12:44] How are you Fariha?
[12:47] I'm fine.
[12:52] I also told your dad that our daughter is fine.
[12:59] If she won't get better at her own house, then where?
[13:05] He was asking about you.  He's worried.
Why?
[13:14] For your future.
[13:20] What have you thought?
[13:29] Mom, I think I should talk to Farhad.
[13:36] Did he try and talk to you?
[13:42] Why are you running behind such a useless relationship that has nothing but pain for you?
[13:54] You do know that your dad, Saqib and everybody else forgave you after a lot of hassle.
[14:05] A lot of people are still asking why we kept you back in our house.
[14:13] You're our daughter, our blood, our life. Relationships don't end.
[14:23] But dear, I beg of you. For God's sake.
[14:31] Don't be stupid enough to jump in this blind well again.
[14:40] You have all your life.
[14:44] Think about yourself. Think about your future.
[14:52] Get a divorce.
[14:59] Farhad will try to pull you back.
[15:07] But you have to move on, for yourself.
[15:14] For us.
[15:34] I'm sure someone mixed something in the food.
[15:37] I can tell without looking at the report. I understood that day only.
[15:42] There is a mess.
Alright, but who did it?
[15:46] Maybe a competitor did it.
[15:50] Everybody has their eyes on us.
[15:52] But all the caterers in this area are like us.
[16:00] Spreading rumors about spoiled food is different but entering in our kitchen,
[16:09] this is someone getting revenge.
[16:13] Did you ask the guys?
[16:15] Yes, I hung them all upside down. Its none of them. But..
[16:21] Yes, a boy is missing since that day.
Who?
[16:25] He was a new guy. Farhad hired out of sympathy. You know how gracious he is with young kids.
[16:33] There was a small kid. He must have done something.
[16:37] Somebody must have told him to do it.
[16:42] First we'll get hold of the boy and then we'll find out who gave him the orders.
[18:34] Do you think we're mad to do this to our own catering business?
[18:40] Why doesn't the police believe us?
[18:44] God knows how my child will be?
[18:48] Mom, be strong.
[18:51] Uncle has gone to talk to the lawyer and Jojo is looking for that boy. We'll find a way soon.
[19:01] You just keep praying.
[19:23] Hello?
[19:25] What did you think? You'll get rid of me so easily?
[19:30] Shahzain? What did you do?
Nothing.
[19:35] I just taught a lesson.
[19:38] Maybe you'll learn to respect your husband now.
[19:42] Husband and respect.. both of these words sound ill from your mouth. You don't know the meaning of either.
[19:49] Shut up and listen to me.
[19:53] If you want your brother to not spend his entire life behind bars, do as I say.
[20:00] What do you want?
You..
[20:09] And the catering business.
[20:12] Now first of all, you'll come back home and name the business to me.
[20:19] Listen to me with open ears. Nothing will happen, Shahzain.
Oh..
[20:27] Then your brother will rot behind bars and the catering business will remain sealed.
[20:35] Now you'll decide for your brother's fate and the last memoir of your father.
[21:02] Shahzain..
[22:20] You're her only sympathizer, we're his enemies.
[22:23] Make him understand. Teach him how to talk. Knock some sense into him.
[22:27] Did you send him with a sieve when God was distributing sense?
[22:40] I agree that I'm short tempered and sometimes I didn't treat you well.
[22:49] I'd vent out my frustration on you.
[22:58] I do realize my mistake.
[23:42] Brother, there is a big problem.
[23:48] Yes, we cannot understand anything.
[23:51] The lawyer said such cases are usually dragged.
[23:54] Its important to find that boy. He'll clear our name or else Farhad will remain in jail.
[24:00] Farhad is in jail?
[24:01] Yes. Someone contaminated the food at the restaurant.
[24:06] The catering business is sealed and Farhad is in jail.
[24:09] We cannot find that new boy.
Who? Rashid?
[24:15] You know him?
I keep tabs on everyone.
[24:19] I found out he's working in another shop.
[24:22] Do you know where he lives?
We'll find out Jojo.
[24:25] We'll do anything for our brother Farhad. Don't you worry.
[24:29] You're a tiger! How long do you need to find out?
Until tomorrow morning.
[24:34] We'll barge into his house tomorrow and beat him up well!
[24:41] Get us some tea.
[25:31] I'm sorry Ramsha.
[25:37] See, I made a big mistake when I raised my hand on you.
[25:45] I know I shouldn't have done it. Please forgive me.
[25:52] If you keep yourself in my place, you'll know how helpless I am.
[26:01] I am not giving you any reason, I'm just apologizing.
[26:09] I'm telling you the truth, I really love you and my unborn child.
[26:18] But loving doesn't mean I'll wrong my parents.
[26:26] Think about it yourself. If I do injustice with them today, what will our child do with us?
[26:37] Please Ramsha, forgive me.
[26:50] Even I should apologize.
[27:06] I didn't realize how selfish I became. I hurt you as well.
[27:16] My motherhood became so merciless
[27:22] that I cannot believe it.
[27:25] I'm very guilty Saqib.
[27:30] Forgive me please.
Please don't apologize.
[27:36] You will not go back there.
[27:39] Uncle, Farhad is in jail. What will become of him?
[27:47] I couldn't think Shahzain could go to this extent.
Yes.
[27:52] He crossed all limits the day he hit you.
[27:56] Such a man can do anything.
Your aunt is right.
[28:03] Mom.. Farhad is in jail, how long will he stay there?
[28:09] Shahzain has become crazy obsessed. He won't back down.
[28:16] So we won't back down as well.
[28:21] I truly believe Farhad will come out of this problem. He's innocent.
[28:27] I will talk to the lawyer. He'll find a way out. Shahzain has accepted that he has done it.
[28:37] If God wills, we'll find a proof as well.
[28:46] How can I sacrifice one of my child to save another?
[28:51] You've already sacrificed a lot.
[28:57] Its decided.
[28:59] You're not going back.
[29:05] We'll find another way out.
[29:21] Dad?
Yes dear.
[29:24] I wanted to talk to you.
Alright.
[29:34] Please get the divorce papers ready.
[29:40] Are you sure?
[29:46] I know what this relationship is worth to Farhad.
[29:50] First he couldn't communicate.
[29:54] And now he has stopped all communication. I can't spend my life like this.
[30:11] I knew it already. It had to happen.
[30:37] Sister in law, I want to talk to you.
[30:40] You should have called me.
[30:42] Please sit down.
[30:55] The decision you took for Kiran today,
[31:00] I know it wasn't easy for you but you did absolutely right.
[31:10] I don't know brother,
[31:13] sometimes I feel that our children are suffering the outcome of our own mistakes.
[31:21] Everybody makes mistakes. I apologize to you.
[31:28] What are you doing? Why?
[31:32] I couldn't do anything for you.
[31:36] Yaqoob's attitude wasn't good with you.
[31:41] Why are you saying this? You're embarrassing me.
[31:46] I know brother, you always tried to make Yaqoob understand tactfully.
[31:57] You were an exemplary good husband but its about nature.
[32:07] Both of you were brothers, brought up in the same household
[32:12] and such different perspectives.
[32:15] You're an example for all of us. Please don't lose courage. I'm with you.
[32:25] We will pull our children out of this mess. Don't consider yourself alone, ever.
[32:38] I pray to God to end all difficulties my children are facing.
[32:52] I told you I'd find the location.
[32:54] They're punks who look for ways to get money out of people like you and Farhad.
[32:59] Once we get them..
[33:01] Do you look like a cheap person or are you really one?
[33:05] What nonsense is this? Why are you laughing?
[33:10] Come on my brother. Truth is always bitter.
[33:13] I have such a good face.
[33:17] I'm already in a bad mood. I'm telling you..
This is his street.
[33:21] And his house is a little far away. Be careful.
Is this it?
[33:31] Where is his house?
Its there.
[33:43] Keep an eye out.
Catch him. He's running..
[34:11] He turned out to be spider man.
[34:13] He isn't spider man, you're slow. Whats the use of you hitting the gym?
[34:18] I didn't have my protein shake.
[34:22] You should be ashamed.
[34:26] You lost him. I told you they were punks.
[34:31] Come on now.
[34:33] You wasted all my hard work.
[34:36] I'm coming. Wait.
[34:41] Yes? Hello.
Farhad Karim Baksh?
[34:45] This is his house.
Please receive his letter.
[34:51] But he's not at home.
Then please you receive it and sign here.
[35:08] Thank you.
[35:18] Fariha, my child?
[35:31] Have you really decided to divorce him?
[35:37] This is a very difficult decision.
[35:41] What else could I do aunt?
[35:44] Should I keep waiting for a man who didn't even ask about me? 
[35:48] He just decided he would free me of this relationship?
[35:52] Fariha, relationships don't involve ego. 
[35:57] You should have asked.
I tried.
[36:01] I called him. He didn't even call back.
[36:10] Aunt, everything changed once we got married.
[36:16] He also changed. 
[36:21] And perhaps I as well.
[36:23] Fariha, everything changes.
[36:30] The relationship isn't the same nor are the human beings.
[36:35] Aunt, you were absolutely right.
[36:40] We need patience to nurture relationships.
[36:44]  We have to compromise 
[36:49] and I'm not patient at all.
[36:54] Its not only his fault. 
[36:59] Both of us failed the test of love.
[37:16] I lost him. I'm telling you he has a connection with Bold.
[37:23] But don't be afraid, Chotu was telling me they're roaming around the streets.
[37:29] If I get him this time, I'll beat him up.
[37:34] He'll speak up and as soon as he does, you'll be out.
[37:44] What will I get coming out Jojo? 
[37:51] I'll be all alone in a crowd there too.
[37:56] I'm alone here as well. I like this place better than the world outside.
[38:09] What are you saying?
[38:15] Fariha told me.
[38:19] When she came here the last time. 
[38:25] She told me I should be locked up for a few days 
[38:28] so that I get some sense knocked into me.
[38:34] People say a lot of things when angry.
[38:40] She wasn't wrong.
[38:45] She was right.
[38:51]  Its my fault.
[39:00] What life can I give her?
[39:06]  I thought I was doing her good staying away from her.
[39:14] But the truth is, I am a coward. 
[39:20] I was scared that,
[39:24] before she leaves me, I should leave her.
[39:37] I created so much distance between us that
[39:44]  it has become difficult to bridge them.
[39:54] What will accepting defeat like this get you?
[40:01] Nobody can win.
[40:15] I was under the misunderstanding.. a bad impression.
[40:31] You go. 
[40:36] I'm fine here.
