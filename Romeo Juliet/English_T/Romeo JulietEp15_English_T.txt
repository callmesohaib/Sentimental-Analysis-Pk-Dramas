[00:13] even I had said the same thing to Kiran
[00:21] sometimes, if her husband raises his hand in anger
[00:25]  then it doesn't mean that he is a bad person
[00:34] it only means that her bad time is going on 
[00:40] Yaqoob!
[00:48] don't be afraid
[00:50] what?
[00:52] don't be afraid
[00:55] stay brave
[01:04] Yaqoob is waiting, he will go home with Farhad
[01:10] I hope Farhad comes soon
[01:15] Sorry to say, he is no more
[01:31] Yqoob!
[08:15] yes tell me?
[08:20] what happened? Will you say something, or keep crying?
[08:25] Shahzain, dad... 
[08:28] dad
[08:30] tell me further, what happened to dad?
[08:38] my father died
[08:44] what!
[08:51] Kiran, don't worry
[08:55] See, one day or the other everyone has to die
[08:59] may God forgive him, where are you right now?
[09:04] In the hospital
[09:07] Farhad just came
[09:10] don't know what era is this
[09:13] means, the child didn't come on time for his father's funeral as well
[09:17] anyways, don't worry I am coming to the hospital
Ok?
[09:22] Okay
[09:54] anyways its good, at least there is no obstacle in my way anymore
[09:59] now I will see, who is going to save the catering business
[10:01] about whom you are talking?
[10:06] Kiran's father
[10:08] Why? What happened?
[10:11] he died
[10:12] and left his catering business for us
[10:15] really?
[10:16] we have very less time then
[10:19] Do quickly whatever you have to do. 
What if Farhad creates any issues for you
[10:25] after all he is Yaqoob's son
[10:28] oh mom, don't worry. Even I am very expert in this game
[10:32] anyways, I am going to the hospital
[10:34] No no, I will also come along. Let me go & get my purse right away
[10:38] okay I am waiting outside
yes yes
[10:43] yes uncle
[10:45] we will go home from here, as we are in the hospital right now
[10:51] yes uncle, ok
[10:54] see you there
[10:56] bye!
[10:57] Jojo
[11:00] look, what happened!
[11:04] I couldn't make Farhad meet uncle
[11:07] I couldn't do this as well
[11:10] why are you blaming yourself?
[11:11] I wish I could have made Farhad meet uncle once
[11:15] if you will do like this, then who will handle Farhad?
[11:19] Farhad needs you right now
[11:21] come on, wipe your tears
[11:23] We have to go to the graveyard, as we need the grave besides my grand father's grave. So please check on it
[11:29] don't take any tension. I am here, I will handle everything
[11:33] is Farhad inside?
[11:34] yes
[11:35] come, lets meet him first then we'll go. Come on
[11:38] and wipe your face
[12:44] come in, dear
[12:46] lets go inside
[13:08] sit down, dear
[13:31] Farhad, there is no use of thinking about those words anymore
[13:38] just pray for his forgiveness, dear
[13:52] he was so angry with me
[13:59] he didn't tell me about his health
[14:01] Angry? With whom he wasn't angry?
[14:06] Yaqoob was always very furious, dear
[14:11] I used to tell him at all times, not to take any tension
[14:17] but my brother... 
[14:22] died before me
[14:28] its God's will, dear
[14:30] everything is due to God's command
[14:34] All of us should accept God's will
[14:40] and Farhad, you have to think about the future
[14:47] Be your mother & sister's strength
[14:51] try to become their courage
[14:56] they need you so much
[15:00] these complaints or grievances.. 
[15:04] there is no use of keeping them
[15:10] spend your life happily with your loved ones
[15:16] I used to explain Yaqoob a lot
[15:20] but he never used to understand
[15:23] at least you should understand, my dear
[15:31] at least you should understand
[15:42] ok dear, I am going to rest now
[15:45] you also go rest
[15:47] have some courage
[15:50] very good!
[17:05] we've become an orphan, uncle
[17:07] don't say this, dear
[17:14] its God's system
[17:20] the person who came in this world, had to leave one day
[17:26] this is the custom, dear
[17:29] You are my very brave daughter
[17:37] if you will cry like this then.. 
[17:40] what about others?
[17:46] have some courage, my child
[17:52] do you know
[17:56] this word "orphan"
[18:00] is so heavy
[18:05] I am realizing it today
[18:10] do you know, how I am feeling?
[18:14] it feels as if... A very strong, thick & big tree with sturdy base
[18:23] Has been cut
[18:25] it has been cut & we are asked to stand in the scorching heat of the sun
[18:34] this happens in God's system
[18:43] if today there is happiness, then tomorrow there are sorrows
[18:50] if today its a sunny day, then tomorrow it will be a cloudy day
[19:03] I won't ask you to show some courage, dear
[19:09] don't consider yourself alone
[19:12] God is great benefactor, my child
[19:17] I won't ask you not to miss your father's presence
[19:27] but... whenever you miss your father then remember
[19:34] Your uncle is alive
[19:39] he is present to put his hand of kindness on your head, my child
[20:04] he was telling me to take care of you guys
[20:09] in fact, he has transferred his catering business on my name
[20:42] Farhad
[20:52] Farhad
[21:55] dad
[21:57] yes Jojo?
[22:06] dear, is Farhad asleep?
[22:09] yes dad, he slept on the terrace
[22:12] you should have asked him to sleep inside the room
[22:17] dad, he is sleeping like a powerless & helpless guy. So I didn't find it appropriate to wake him up
[22:24] anyways.. 
[22:26] its good
[22:28] at least he'll rest for a while
[22:31] my child was so tired
[22:34] ok dear
[22:35] dad
[22:36] yes my child?
[22:41] dad, after looking at Farhad's condition I've realized that how important parents are
[22:47] you gave so many sacrifices for us, but I had never said "thanks" to you
[22:53] oh Jojo, my son.. 
[22:56] whatever parents do for their children
[23:00] its their children right
[23:02] whatever we did for you, is your right my dear. Its your right, my son
[23:12] but dad, one should say "thanks" for this right & this thanks should be done in this life
[23:18] otherwise it gets too late
[23:20] and then its difficult to live with regrets, and you are left with nothing
[23:26] you are talking about such big things!
[23:29] have you forgotten? I am the eldest of this house
[23:33] and I am still alive, my son..
[23:38] I do such big talks, got it?
[25:40] hello!
[25:43] Fareeha?
[25:45] you've called so late night, is everything fine?
[25:47] greetings aunt Shaggo..
[25:50] I'm so sorry to disturb you so late night by calling
[25:53] No no, are you fine. Is everyone else fine?
[25:58] aunt...
[26:00] Farhad's father had passed away
[26:03] what!
[26:06] Farhad's father had passed away
[26:09] *Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return*
[26:14] what had happened to him, dear?
[26:16] he had a heart attack
[26:20] is Farhad fine?
[26:23] Farhad is in the state of shock
[26:26] I came home from the hospital, and he went to his house. We didn't talk after that
[26:31] I was feeling so anxious, that's why I have called you
[26:37] don't know aunt Shaggo
[26:41] I am unable to do anything for him in this situation, even if I want to
[26:45] his family doesn't want to see my face
[26:48] and his mother is blaming me for this situation
[26:51] I don't understand, what to do
[26:54] Fareeha, my dear its all God's work
[26:59] you don't have any fault in this
[27:05] don't take this burden on your heart for no reason
[27:08] sometimes, people talk inappropriate things in grief
[27:13] don't worry Fareeha, everything will be fine
[27:17] Shaggo
yes
[27:19] is Fareeha alone at home?
[27:22] yes
[27:23] tell her that we are coming to pick her right away
[27:26] this will be fine
[27:28] Fareeha, Hamid is saying that we will come to pick you right away
[27:32] since you are alone, so it will be appropriate
[27:35] No aunt, that's not an issue. I am not alone
[27:38] Aunt Channo, my neighbor. She is with me
[27:43] She & her husband had supported us a lot in this situation
[27:47] she is with me
[27:48] its such a good thing that someone is with you
[27:52] because if Farhad is with his family, then you should be with your family as well
[27:59] Okay, then we'll come to pick you in the morning
[28:03] you can come to us, until Farhad doesn't comes back
[28:08] I will see, I will see tomorrow what needs to be done
[28:14] thank you so much!
[28:16] I've got so much courage by talking to you, I was so worried
[28:21] my child, you can call me whenever you want to
[28:25] don't think a bit
[28:28] I get happy to hear your voice
[28:32] I'm really as I had disturbed you at this time. I didn't wanted to but.. 
[28:39] Okay
[28:42] Ok, bye!
yes, I will call you tomorrow. Bye!
[28:57] Farhad's family is holding her responsible for it
[29:01] to Fareeha?
[29:07] what will happen now?
[29:11] tomorrow morning we'll go & bring here over here
[29:14] Ok?
[29:19] thank you!
[29:23] hey!
[29:25] what's the problem?
[29:28] sit here
[29:31] sit down
[29:36] I... 
[29:38] I've been noticing since a few days that you stay so lost
[29:42] is everything fine?
[29:48] I had gone to meet Fareeha
[29:52] I saw her at Shaggo's wedding
[29:57] and I heard people talking about her so... 
[30:01] I couldn't hold myself
[30:08] even I felt like meeting her
[30:15] but... 
[30:19] how is she?
[30:24] she is fine
[30:28] she is absolutely fine
[30:29] without us
[30:31] she is fine
[30:36] I had asked her to come back home
[30:41] I thought.. 
[30:44] somehow, that I will convince you & Saqib
[30:50] but.. 
[30:52] she is still crazy in love
[30:57] I thought, maybe she is alone
[31:03] and must be missing us
[31:06] she must be regretting her decision
[31:09] she must be thinking that...
[31:13] when you & I will ask her to come back home
[31:18] but... 
[31:21] there isn't any such thing
[31:27] I have accepted this reality
[31:33] She is not our daughter now, she has become Farhad's wife
[31:41] I mean, she is our daughter... 
[31:44] but... 
[31:46] what is the use of keeping hope from her? It will hurt us
[31:51] so.. 
[31:53] remove her from your heart & don't think about her
[32:06] how will I solace you, as I myself is heartbroken
[32:27] I am unable to come out of this shock
[32:32] dad had visited me a few days ago
[32:37] he said to me
[32:40] you are my son
[32:44] and after me, you have to handle everything
[32:59] he had considered you his son
[33:03] why he won't consider him? 
After all, he had filled the presence of his son
[33:17] he was such a nice man
[33:20] he always gave me so much of love & respect
[33:33] he seemed quite worried when he had visited me few days ago
[33:39] now when I think, it feels... 
[33:42] as if he got to know what is about to happen
[33:54] if I had a little idea that he is so unwell, then I would have taken him to the doctor immediately
[34:09] he was concerned about you all while leaving
[34:18] what as such he came to say to you?
[34:22] he was so worried about you all
[34:26] he was telling me to take care of you guys
[34:31] in fact, he has transferred his catering business on my name
[34:48] also he was saying
[34:50] that its only me, who can handle this responsibility after his demise
[35:17] dad left so soon
[35:20] also he had shifted such a big responsibility on my shoulders
[35:31] how will I fill his presence?
[36:00] Kareem Baksh & sons is our family business
[36:08] Yaqoob didn't transferred it on your name
[36:15] but on Kiran's name
[36:44] So now, will my daughter-in-law sit at the shop?
[36:53] how is this possible, sister?
[36:57] if your son has turned away his face, then it doesn't mean this way
[37:02] A while ago, you people were so happy with this decision
[37:13] its such a good thing though
[37:17] Besides, my everything belongs to Kiran
[37:29] and dad had set such a good example
[37:36] that he didn't transferred his business on his son's name but on his daughter's name
[37:46] he didn't even think about you
[37:49] maybe he never thought that you are capable of it
[38:05] and don't you worry, Farhad
[38:08] Kiran & I will handle everything
[38:13] as it is, you have to go back to your house
[38:24] you guys came for the condolence
[38:26] what discussion you have started?
[38:29] lets pray for the departed soul
