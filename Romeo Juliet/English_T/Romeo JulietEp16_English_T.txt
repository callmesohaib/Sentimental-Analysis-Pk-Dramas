[00:13] who misses those daughters who leaves the house after ruining their parents honor?
[00:22] So why my mother cannot say such things to me while looking into my eyes?
[00:25] what are you doing here as of yet? 
[00:28] Hamid & Shaggo had invited you, and they've gone
[00:31] so what are you doing here? 
[00:33] now don't waste my time
[00:36] do you want to leave me? Will you leave me so easily, answer me!
[00:39] will you leave me so easily? will you leave me? 
[00:43] why do you hurt me again & again, Kiran. Why!
[00:57] take these 2 right now
[01:02] you need to take green & orange one after lunch
[01:06] don't know where I have kept it
listen...
[01:21] Did Kiran come?
[01:26] did you talk to her?
[01:27] yes
[01:29] what do you mean by "yes"?
[01:33] what was she saying?
[01:37] was everything fine?
she got injured so..
[01:42] she was saying that she got injured by the corner of the table
[01:48] Thank God!
[01:54] I got worried...
[01:58] that may God keeps everything fine, don't know what had happened
[02:06] are you so worried for your daughter?
[02:19] obviously
[02:22] she is my daughter
[02:32] I was also someone's daughter, Yaqoob
[02:57] I agree...
[03:00] that my anger is way too much
[03:07] Maybe sometimes, I don't used to treat you well
[03:17] but what I could do?
[03:25] the situation of my business wasn't good
[03:28] then the household expenses
[03:30] also the tension of many other things
[03:39] I used to take out someone else's anger at home
[03:50] I do realize my mistake
[03:59] but for whom I was doing that
[04:02] I did everything for you all, and..
[04:26] even I had said the same thing to Kiran
[04:34] sometimes, if her husband raises his hand in anger
[04:39] then it doesn't mean that he is a bad person
[04:47] it only means that her bad time is going on
[04:52] which is written in her fate
[05:20] my mother used to explain me the same thing
[05:25] don't worry
[05:34] Our Kiran is exactly like me
[05:37] 'Patient'
[05:55] she will also handle whatever is written in her fate
[06:20] get out of my house!
[06:21] Yaqoob!
be quiet!
[06:23] Quiet!
Yaqoob...
[06:33] Yaqoob!
[07:30] Fareeha, Jojo was saying sorry for the lamp
[07:36] its ok
[07:40] Okay I am going to the gym to watch match with my friends
[07:45] I will come after the match ends
[07:48] are you serious?
[07:51] yes, means?
[07:53] Farhad, we had planned for so long that today we'll go out for the dinner
[07:59] and you've made your own plans without discussing with me
[08:04] so, we'll go next week
[08:07] why are you talking like a typical girl?
[08:09] because you are talking like a typical boy
[08:13] have you seen the condition of our room?
[08:14] I've told you thousands of time, to put the wet towel outside. Don't throw it on the bed like this
[08:20] if I would have explained this to a 2 years kid, then he would have understood it by now
[08:28] so, I am not a 2 year old kid
[08:30] and you aren't my mom
[08:34] what difference does it make, if I haven't kept something on its right place?
[08:37] I am a human, not a robot
[08:38] absolutely correct! What difference does it make?
only your wife gets troubled
[08:42] so who is asking you to get troubled?
 Did I ask you?
[08:45] if I don't make efforts in this house, then even your perfume would be lying here or there without its cap
[08:52] one minute Fareeha, first think what is the problem!
[08:55] is the perfume problem? friends? or Cricket match?
What is the problem!
[09:00] everything!
[09:04] Sorry, I am such a bad guy
[09:12] do you even realize a bit that how much you've embarrassed me in front of my parents?
[09:17] I told everyone that its chill, we'll watch the match at home as Fareeha is such a chill lady
[09:20] but you've humiliated me in front of everyone!
[09:23] you are right, I've humiliated you a lot in front of your friends. So, go to them
[09:29] go
[09:41] Fareeha, you weren't so harsh before our marriage
[09:45] Farhad, even you weren't so cheap & careless before our wedding
[09:49] I am like this! if you want to stay with me then tolerate me in this way
[10:29] what's the matter? You seem quite happy since your father-in-law had visited you
[10:36] it seems that... 
didn't he gave you the car keys?
[10:40] oh mom, it will be a lot more than this & much better. Don't worry
[10:45] and do you know, Kiran's father catering business is about to get transferred on my name
[10:50] are you telling the truth?
[10:51] So, will you sit in the kitchen now?
[10:53] oh mom, who is going to sit there
[10:56] let it get transferred on my name once, I will sell it right away
[11:06] it has commercial value, so we'll get hefty price of it
[11:11] Oh wow! We'll become so rich then
[11:14] mom, just pray that it gets transferred on my name once. Then you'll see what I will do
[11:42] hey Jojo, our team isn't playing well
[11:45] it happens...
oh look, who is here!
[11:49] So...
[11:53] did you get the permission from your wife?
[11:55] he didn't get the permission, in fact he got ousted from the house
[11:58] look at his face!
[12:01] oh yes, look... it seems he got beaten up
[12:06] Hero... did you had a fight with your wife?
[12:11] I don't understand her
[12:13] I mean, in a minute... she talks to me with so much of love, she is so sweet & caring
[12:20] and on the next minute, she gets completely crazy!
[12:22] I mean, what's the big deal if I didn't put my socks in the laundry basket?
[12:28] I also do so many work, did I ever mention?
[12:31] No, right?
[12:34] what's the big deal if I haven't put my wet towel on its place?
[12:39] yes, it seems that Pakistan & India's match is started at Farhad's house
[12:44] and his wife got him out on the very first ball
[12:49] brother look, I am not married as of yet to give you suggestions
[12:54] but I am giving you an important suggestion, so take it
[12:57] See, try to agree with her on petty matters & ignore big matters
[13:02] this is the secret of a successful marriage, dad had told me
[13:06] oh man, stop your rubbish!
[13:08] he is asking me to apply the suggestions of nineties in 2024
[13:11] brother, do you want a suggestion from nowadays?
Nowadays, equal partnership is being practiced
[13:16] whose socks are dirty?
Yours!
[13:18] So, you'll pick them & put them in the basket
[13:21] yes!
[13:22] are you getting my point?
this is being practiced nowadays
[13:24] got his point?
yes?
[13:27] and wet towel! everyone hates it as it is
[13:30] are you on my side or her side?
[13:32] I am on the side of correct thing
[13:34] he is on the correct side!
it was all his mistake
[13:37] he broke the lamp & made me stand in front of her
[13:39] you are talking wrong. Look, I didn't break the lamp, don't put the blame on me
[13:44] the lamp broke along with your wife's patience
[13:47] its a delicate matter, try to understand
[13:48] stop your rubbish! 
I came to watch match, so let me see that
[13:51] Out out!
[13:54] oh wow, this is great!
[14:00] yes
[14:03] greetings aunt Channo, I need a favor. Can I get some sugar, as I don't have it
[14:09] Greetings dear, yes yes. Come inside, come on
[14:14] thank you!
[14:15] Wow... Wow!
[14:18] Greetings!
[14:23] he won't be able to hear anything at this time
[14:28] but what happens to men while watching a match?
[14:33] till date, I didn't know that Farhad watches cricket
[14:40] and today he is so bad about cricket that he is unable to understand anything else
[14:44] you are newly married, that's why
slowly & gradually, you'll start seeing so many things
[14:51] then you'll feel like getting disappeared
[14:55] then how to earn a livelihood?
[14:57] whatever things you are disliking about him
[15:00] maybe, he also dislikes a few things about you too
[15:05] its not necessary that both of you like the same thing
[15:09] the important thing is that one shall value the likes of another person
[15:14] its difficult in the beginning
[15:18] but slowly & gradually everything gets fine
[15:26] when we are in love with someone, we wait for hours for the person to call us
[15:32] and then we talk with that person for hours
[15:33] but all of it happens before marriage
[15:38] after marriage, one has to see the other person's face on daily basis
[15:41] and it get boring, like we are from each other
[15:47] anyways...
[15:48] but...
[15:51] do you know, what is the real test?
[15:55] the real test is in silence
[16:02] either you become frustrated by staying silent
[16:07] or...
[16:09] you get peace by each others silence
[16:16] this is the real test
[16:18] not in talks
[16:21] the matter hasn't reached to silence as of yet, because we fight before that
[16:28] there is a lot to say that..
[16:34] you are young & emotional
[16:36] slowly & gradually, you'll become patience with time
[16:42] but... you need to do handwork to reach to that level
[17:12] that's it? Is it done?
[17:15] yes? what happened?
[17:19] No, I mean... the same way a lamp broke in my house today
[17:25] I had brought that lamp with so much of love
[17:29] Actually, I am so possessive about my things
[17:34] but it didn't made any difference to Farhad
[17:37] the way you don't like his match, maybe the same way he didn't like your lamp
[17:45] the way you love your lamp
[17:48] Farhad loves cricket the same way, so tolerate it
[17:53] think...
[17:55] work hard... and don't get yourself trapped in such a petty matters
[18:03] Ok look, since the lamp is broken so now you have to bring a new lamp too. Right?
[18:09] this is beneficial!
[18:14] ok listen
[18:16] if you ever miss your family, house or mother. Then come to me
[18:20] I feel good whenever you visit me
[18:24] Thank you!
[18:29] Greetings mom!
[18:31] Greetings!
[18:33] Greetings aunt & uncle!
