[00:13] now look at the building's condition, its so dirty
[00:16]  is it so difficult to keep a janitor here or to keep the dustbins?
[00:20] and have you noticed this mice issues?
[00:22]  its just like putting a band aid, but the disease is as it is
[00:26] its all her doing, her mistake 
[00:29] No, its not her mistake
[00:31] its my own decision, mom 
[00:34] and what do you think? If I will go back with you today then dad will forgive me?
[00:39] or will he give me a hug?
[00:41]  I don't remember how does it feel to hug your father
[00:44] its your hand in bringing our family on this verge, dad
[00:49]  you don't care about respect at all
[00:51] but I do care about my honor & reputation
[00:54]  I have to save myself for the sake of my family's future
[01:29] oh dear, if you would have done this work on the very first day then maybe you didn't had to go through so much
[01:36] I've been telling you since so long that she is taking undue advantage of your nature
[01:41] so Missy? are you back to your senses now?
[01:47] we were getting so many good proposals for you
[01:50] I wish you had agreed at that time
[01:54] what's the point of this discussion now?
[01:56] after all, I have to fulfill this relation now
[02:00] and I think, now you should understand the rules & regulations of this house
[02:07] I don't like doing all this
[02:17] ok mom, I am leaving. Bye!
[02:19] at least drink your tea
[02:21] I will drink in the office, bye!
[02:24] bye!
[02:31] and please..
[02:33] don't hurt me again like this
[02:55] brother, put 2 kgs of tomatoes & 1 kg of potatoes in it
[02:58] hey Fariha, are you doing something for the religious event that we are celebrating day after tomorrow?
[03:03] No, nobody told me
[03:05] but we were thinking that this time you'll look after all the arrangements
[03:08] why shall I?
[03:09] you think so much about us & our family. And whoever becomes a part of this program gets a lot of appreciation here
[03:17] won't aunt Channo mind?
[03:19] Channo aunty had been doing it since always, and this year also same?
[03:22] this time something should be new as per new generation
[03:25] Great! I enjoy a lot while doing all this. I do great event management though
[03:36] oh! all of you are here & I am..
[03:40] oh aunt Channo...
[03:41] let it be..
[03:43] brother Manzoor will do all the arrangements, ok?
[03:46] tent, chairs & tables... the way he does every year
[03:51] but this year we won't use firecrackers
[03:54] even this year as well?
[03:56] absolutely not!
[03:58] these are the only celebrations to enjoy, our kids have bought the firecrackers since so long
[04:03] then explain your kids
[04:05] its the night to pray
[04:08] but kids enjoy such things
[04:10] Enough! As I said, nobody will play with firecrackers
[04:12] lets do one thing, lets make a separate place for the kids on the side so that they can play with the firecrackers
[04:17] this way they will also enjoy, and the elders will enjoy too. What do you say?
[04:21] yes! this idea is good
[04:23] what's good in it?
[04:25] how can one control the kids?
[04:27] We'll ask PK to take care of the kids & I think our building children are wise enough
[04:33] you've been doing the event since so many years, now give a chance to someone else as well
[04:40] to whom?
[04:43] to her?
[04:46] yes! we shall try something new this time
[04:50] Wow! I do everything every year
[04:53] Eid, Ramzan, religious events... everything!
[04:58] I do all the arrangements, right?
[05:00] was there amiss?
[05:02] oh aunt Channo, who is removing you from the event? 
You have to handle all the arrangements
[05:08] and you have to do the food arrangement, this time as well
[05:12] she will only take care of the decor & entertainment related things
[05:15] as it is, such events are enjoyable if we do the things together
[05:21] what do you say, aunt Channo?
[05:29] get lost!
[05:52] Mr. Agha!
[05:54] won't you say something or will you keep hiding behind the book?
[05:58] I am here, Maam
[05:59] Channo, you've said it yourself to sit quietly & don't ask anything
[06:05] by the way, I know everything
[06:06] your problem is that new wretched girl
[06:10] yes
[06:13] see, its been only a few days that she came to live here
[06:18] and look at these women
[06:20] they took away my charge & gave it to that girl
[06:27] they are so ungrateful women
[06:30] they say, young blood is better. We have become old, are we of no use?
[06:35] did they said such things about my Channo?
 Let me go & fix them right away
[06:41] just wait & watch, is this something to be said to my Channo!
[06:45] let me go & fix them right away
[06:48] we've become old!
[06:50] by the way Channo, I was thinking that we are getting the food prepared
[06:56] yes
[06:57] So, we should focus on the food right?
[07:01] then rest of the things?
[07:03] let them do the rest of the things, everything will become crystal clear
[07:07] this new girl cannot stand against my Channo at all
[07:13] what is her worth!
[07:15] the personality you have, and your glamour. Everything is flat in front of it
[07:21] really Mr. Agha?
[07:23] yes
[07:24] but..
[07:26] I swear upon your life Channo, I'm telling the truth. Nobody can compete you
[07:33] We should focus on our work
[07:36] I will get such an amazing food prepared that all these women will keep licking their fingers
[07:41] they will become your fan for an entire life. Don't worry
[07:46] but Mr. Agha, only food..
[07:49] don't worry about the food
[07:51] a few days are still there, so we'll do best arrangements. Everyone is going to appreciate you
[07:57] ok?
[07:58] Just do one thing. Only focus on your glamour & see what you have to wear on that day
[08:23] how come you have come here?
[08:28] my mom was coming to my house
[08:30] can't you tell this to me earlier?
[08:33] really! Had you allowed to let her come if I would have told you?
[08:37] not to listen to such things
[08:39] how would I know that aunt will say such things after going there?
[08:44] and you are so selfish
[08:47] I?
[08:48] I am selfish?
[08:50] No, I am. Do you even care a bit that how your mother is living in that house?
[08:55] without you & without Kiran
[08:56] I had asked her to come & live with me
[09:00] she shall live with you, after leaving her husband & house
[09:04] are you a kid? Is this some joke?
[09:11] what shall I tell you
[09:13] what is the situation in that house
[09:17] its a mourning environment there
[09:27] even earlier nobody used to be happy there
[09:31] I agree that our family wasn't a perfect one like a filmy poster
[09:36] but there were happiness
[09:41] you are my brother
[09:43] and you have one problem.
[09:45] You always focus on pain, you don't see anything else
[09:51] I remember...
[09:53] when I came running to you to impress my girlfriend
[09:58] that bro, please write me a nice message
[10:03] you, I & Kiran...
[10:06] watching movies for an entire night
[10:09] to talk..
[10:13] to prepare coffee
[10:16] the way mom used to feed pan to dad
[10:22] and the way dad used to watch TV for 24 hours
[10:26] to take out the notes of hundred rupees from his wallet
[10:34] uncle's scolding & the way Kiran used to save us
[10:39] I miss all this
[10:42] Kiran's one smile used to give life to everyone
[10:50] and now she has forgotten to smile as well
[10:55] What happened to Kiran?
[10:57] is there any problem in her life?
[11:00] has she ever told us till date that what problem she is facing?
[11:03] she hides it
[11:06] there is no more spark on her face, and its clearly visible
[11:11] and you!
[11:13] you never used to pass a single day without her
[11:16] what do you used to say?
[11:18] my dear sister, I will do anything for her.
 Now see, you hardly talk to her
[11:22] I had called her thousands of times, but her husband doesn't like me
[11:26] She has broken her relation with me
[11:27] relations don't break so easily
[11:30] she is your sister
[11:31] nobody needs this brother, nobody needs this son
[11:35] I've always been the reason of a problem for everyone
[11:39] when I had tried to become a good brother for Kiran, then her husband got upset
[11:43] when I had tried to become a good son for mom, then my father got upset
[11:46] when I went to sit at the kitchen for dad, then his respect was lessened
[11:49] what else do you want from me? Shall I commit suicide?
[11:52] what are you talking!
[12:00] what do you think?
[12:03] I don't miss them?
[12:07] I don't feel hurt?
[12:13] whenever I have tried to become the reason of their happiness
[12:17] I have always disappointed them
[12:19] but you have never disappointed me
[12:22] in fact, you've always been so good for me
[12:26] you are my brother
[12:44] come, lets go to drink tea
[12:46] don't you want to go home? Isn't Fareeha waiting?
[12:54] I will go a bit late
[12:56] I will message Fareeha, already my head is so full I need to lessen its burden
[13:01] lets go, come on
[13:23] hello! one minute...
[13:27] yes
[13:29] you know, how I am coming here after escaping from mom's questions with a lot of difficulty
[13:35] do you need to talk to me secretly?
[13:37] well, leave that & tell me how are you doing?
[13:43] I am fine, did you talk to aunt Shaggo?
[13:46] yes, she also misses you a lot
[13:48] she wants you to attend her wedding but..
[13:52] but?
[13:53] but the entire situation was changed, when she went to talk about it
[13:57] brother Saqib & sister Ramsha says that they won't attend this wedding
[14:02] why?
[14:03] their respect, as you know
[14:08] as if its not a respect but a Bateesa (sweetmeat)
[14:10] it gets shattered as soon as you put it in your mouth
[14:13] you're giving an example of food in this as well, this is great!
[14:18] anyways...
[14:20] now tell me what's the situation, what do you think?
[14:24] would I be able to come or not?
[14:27] I don't know sister, but we are still trying
[14:32] at least, you & Zara shall come over someday to meet me
[14:36] I have become so lonely here
[14:39] do you remember, I used to run upstairs on the terrace to find a peaceful time for a few moments
[14:47] and here, the entire day gets passed without talking to anyone
[14:53] I have become so lonely here, Billu
[14:56] yes sister, even I miss you so much
[15:00] they are doing a religious festival here, both of you shall over by making some excuse at home
[15:07] let me speak to sister Zara, but send me the details
[15:12] Ok, bye!
[16:21] Farhad, you came so late. I had been waiting for you since so long
[16:25] sorry, I woke you up
[16:27] why are you lying here? And why were you waiting?
[16:31] I had told you that I will be late
[16:33] I wasn't expecting that you'll come this much late
[16:37] where have you been?
[16:39] I had gone to drink tea with Jojo & Moosa
[16:44] I thought you are going out with your office colleagues
[16:47] why will I go with them?
[16:51] why didn't you tell me that with whom you are going out?
[16:55] what difference does it make that with whom I am going?
I had told you that I will be late
[17:00] Farhad, I am all alone here for an entire day
[17:03] at least, come home on time at night please
[17:08] I've gone for a single day only, I don't go on daily basis though
[17:12] what's the issue?
[17:13] did you ever ask me that what I am doing here, how am I feeling?
[17:19] have I ever stopped you for doing something?
[17:22] you also go & meet your friends
[17:25] my cousins were my friends, Farhad
I cannot meet them
[17:31] oh yes
[17:34] then make new friends
[17:37] and you were saying about doing a job, this way you will also get busy
[17:42] so that you can roam around freely with your friends
[17:44] Fareeha, why are you having problems with my friends all of a sudden?
[17:46] I don't have a problem with your friends but with your attitude, Farhad
[17:51] what have I done now?
[17:55] nothing!
[18:04] Fareeha
[18:06] Fareeha
[18:10] Fareeha, don't be upset
[18:12] I am not upset
[18:16] sure?
[18:17] go sleep
[18:25] sure, you are not upset?
[18:26] yes
[18:34] Farhad, are you are literally going to sleep?
[18:39] Fareeha, I have to go to the office tomorrow morning
[18:41] I am tired
[18:43] can we talk about it tomorrow morning?
[18:45] absolutely correct! go to sleep
[18:47] I only disturb you, what else I do. Right?
[18:51] what?
[18:52] go to sleep
[19:03] don't keep your dirty socks on the dining table, Farhad
[19:17] you are upset upon the fact that I haven't become your slave?
[19:20]  Shameless! Whatever I have, will I take it all to my grave?
[19:26] its all yours! 
[19:30] I wanted to teach you
[19:32] I wanted to make you capable enough so that you can handle it 
[20:43] Farhad
[20:46] Farhad
[20:49] Farhad
[20:51] Farhad
[21:01] hello!
[21:03] why didn't you wake me up before leaving?
[21:06] I thought why to wake you up as you were resting
[21:10] also you were sleeping outside
[21:17] I'm sorry
[21:20] I'm sorry too
[21:22] I know you get bored
[21:25] you've become lonely
[21:28] don't worry, lets make a program together. So that your boredom shall be subsided
[21:35] come home a bit early today, as its a religious event & you have to do all the arrangements of the program
[21:40] oh, and its your specialty
[21:42] in fact, I am thinking to start an event management company together
[21:46] Our team will be a killer team, just like previous times
[21:52] only focus on your job right now
[21:54] Bye, come early ok?
[21:58] Okay fine, I'll talk to you later
[22:02] love you... bye!
[22:21] Greetings!
[22:22] where the decoration guys haven't come as of yet?
[22:24] I don't know, I tried calling them but they didn't receive. Let me call again
[22:28] but aunt Channo used to do all the arrangements by this time
[22:32] and there isn't any setup done as of yet, nothing is here. 
Hello!
[22:35] Greetings! This is Fareeha Motiwala speaking. Why your guys haven't reached as of yet? Its very late for the setup
[22:41] what do you mean that its canceled?
 I had finalized everything with you last night on call
[22:49] where he has gone? Where have you sent him?
[22:52] who canceled it?
[23:00] Okay
[23:03] is everything ok?
[23:04] yes, I think hey will be here within some time. I am calling them
[23:09] since there is a traffic on the way, so I think they got stuck there
[23:12] let me go & talk to them
[23:14] I don't think so that she will be able to handle it
[23:21] my work is done, I am leaving
[23:22] Farhad, we are about to start the meeting with the client
[23:25] yes sir, I have emailed you the slides
[23:27] leave that. And please go to the next door cafe & bring coffee and pastries for everyone
[23:33] sir what?
[23:35] yes, be quick. Go & bring it for almost 10 people
[23:39] quickly, don't be late please
[23:44] I had told you not to pick a fight with them
[24:04] I have been ignoring all of your actions till date by considering you an elderly person
[24:08] but today, you've crossed all the limits
[24:12] you hate me so much that you didn't care about the rest of the people living in this building
[24:16] you didn't even think that tonight is so special for them
[24:22] you know its a tradition from long time, but today because of your ego you've ruined it
[24:28] congrats to you, you've won. Now celebrate your victory
[24:32] and don't worry
[24:35] I haven't told anyone that you've called brother Manzar & canceled everything
[24:40] I have taken all the responsibility on myself
[24:44] be happy
[24:51] was this girl telling the truth?
[24:53] Mr. Agha, actually... 
Channo!
[24:56] Mr. Agha, this girl...
[24:58] this girl has made my life a living hell since she came here
[25:03] I had made my place in this building with a lot of difficulty
[25:07] She wants to snatch it all. Should I sit idly & look?
[25:13] this cannot happen
[25:14] we cannot put love & respect in a person's heart forcefully
[25:18] and whatever you are doing, this way you will ruin your respect as well
[25:27] where are you going?
[25:28] I am going to help that girl
[25:30] tonight is way too bigger than the fights of both of you
[25:34] the night of forgiveness!
[25:36] do think about it
[25:56] Hello!

[29:51] the kids of your neighborhood are so ill-mannered
[29:53] honestly! They are running after me with the firecrackers
[29:58] I would have given them a tight slap if they had been from my neighborhood

[30:49] Okay so Farhad is your son, wow!
[30:57] quickly do your work
[31:00] Greetings uncle!
[31:03] Greetings!
[31:05] Farhad, you had never mentioned that Karim Baksh & sons is of your father. We are getting the food from them since so many years
[31:13] yes uncle, we had never discussed it
[31:16] we & our work isn't capable enough to be discussed
[31:21] he feels disrespected by this work
[31:23] no no brother, no work is big or small
[31:27] and God blesses that person who earns his living honestly
[31:32] only if this fool understands this!
[31:35] Both of them are sensible. Your son & your daughter-in-law both are quite sensible kids
[31:43] Farhad, come on help your father. Quickly take out the food & serve it
[31:48] its the time
[31:49] brother, glad to see you. 
Let me go & handle your aunt Channo

[32:00] I still have power in my arms, I will do it myself
[32:04] come on!
Farhad..
[32:10] uncle...
[32:12] I know you are angry with us
[32:16] but if possible, then give a chance to your son
[32:20] he doesn't says but he misses you all so much
[32:25] maybe he is like you, I can see in your eyes that how much you love him
[32:31] I wish both of you can express your emotions in words, maybe both of you are able to lessen your pain
[32:39] hurry up, Shamshad!
[32:49] let me help them
[32:51] you had asked me not to show you my face, I will try
[32:57] but let me help right now
[33:00] let him come brother Yaqoob, the work will be done quickly
[33:04] as if you can't do the work
[33:06] come on!
[33:08] oho! what's the matter now?
sit here quietly
[33:12] yes?
[33:14] listen
[33:16] if anyone asks you then say that you are going on a dinner with me & Saad
[33:21] how many times you'll tell the same thing?
[33:23] I can't lie
[33:25] its not a lie at all, you don't know about the plans I & Sister Fareeha used to make. She is a complete warrior
[33:30] and you are such a weak soldier
[33:32] don't talk rubbish! I don't know such clever antics like you guys do
[33:36] lets go before anyone comes & starts questioning us
listen to me
[33:40] no matter if anyone says anything, you have to answer confidently. Ok?
Lets go!
[33:48] where are you guys going at this hour?
[33:57] yes?
[34:01] actually we are going on the dinner
yes, we are going on the dinner with brother Saad
[34:06] really!
[34:08] Zara..
[34:11] You are going on the dinner with Saad, right?
[34:17] aunt, we are going to meet Fareeha
[34:22] Fareeha?
[34:24] what is this drama?
[34:26] basically sister Fareeha was missing us a lot and.. 
we were also missing her too much
[34:33] yes, actually today is a religious occasion
[34:36] you know, we always used to play with the firecrackers & stay awake all night long
[34:40] we thought, this way we'll able to spend sometime with her
[34:45] we'll come quickly, if anyone asks then tell them that Billu has gone for the dinner with me & Saad
[34:50] No
[34:52] Not at all
[34:57] No
[34:59] because I am going with you guys
[35:04] really?
[35:05] I also want to meet Fareeha
[35:08] lets go then
come on
[35:28] Channo, everyone is asking about you outside
[35:35] I won't go
[35:37] I am not able to show my face to anyone
[35:41] Fareeha didn't tell anything to anyone
[35:46] that's fine but...
[35:50] maybe I cannot face myself as well
[35:52] Look, God notices everyone's intentions
[35:55] I know, your heart is completely clear
[35:59] you are a bit furious but you have a good heart
[36:02] come on get up, be quick. People are asking about you outside
[36:06] there is no liveliness without you, get up!
[36:09] really?
[36:11] what else? You know I don't like any gathering without you
[36:16] you had made such a nice dress. Get up & wear it. Hurry up!
[36:20] I'm coming
[36:43] Shall I help?
[36:47] Your respect will get lessen by doing this work
[36:52] dad, I used to sit in your kitchen right?
[36:55] I used to help you right?
[36:56] as if you did a great favor on me
[36:59] did I said that?
[37:01] what's there to say? I can see everything
[37:08] Mr. Agha was telling me that you've started doing a job somewhere
[37:12] what salary are you getting?
[37:15] Thanks God I am getting well paid
[37:17] wow...
[37:19] you show tantrums in working with your father
[37:21] but after wearing pant shirt you can survive in a less salary as well, right?
[37:27] dad, job requires all this
[37:30] one succeeds slowly & gradually
[37:31] there is no need to teach me
[37:34] the way I have settled my business, I know it very well
[37:38] I keep people like you on the job
[37:42] you are upset upon the fact that I haven't become your slave?
[37:45] Shameless! Whatever I have, will I take it all to my grave?
[37:51] its all yours!
[37:55] I wanted to teach you
[37:57] I wanted to make you capable enough so that you can handle it
[38:00] but no
[38:02] you think as if its your father's slavery
[38:05] remember one thing
[38:07] you feel like a king even after doing the slavery of your loved ones
[38:11] you will keep rubbing your feet for one month's salary
[38:15] and this job will change your vegetables
[38:18] today you can have ridge gourd, tomorrow you can have okra, and day after tomorrow you can have potatoes
[38:22] but your status won't be changed
[38:25] whatever you are rejecting today, you will regret about it in the future for sure
[38:31] and maybe until then its too late
[38:37] you are right
[38:40] maybe I will regret to reject your kitchen
[38:47] but will you ever regret upon rejecting your son?
