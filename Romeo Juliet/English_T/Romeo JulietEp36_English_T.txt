[12:21] that their children do the graduation & that too with first division
[12:25] but you... at least be a little happy in my happiness
[12:28] oh brother! First try to handle your father's responsibilities
[12:32] then tell me my duties, which I have fulfilled more than my capability
[12:37] dad, for now you need to relax as your blood pressure is very high
[12:42] so what else could happen?
[12:45] I can only relax if someone shall help me & support with my burden
[12:50] only the blood pressure will increase in this situation
[12:54] I am telling you, do come to my catering business from tomorrow onwards
[13:11] I have been searching for you since so long & you are sitting here
[13:17] nobody can sit alone in this house for even 5 minutes
[13:21] I came to find peace but you have come here as well
[13:24] until you are in this house, there is no peace or loneliness
[13:27] everyone calls you after every 5 minutes, right?
[13:30] anyways, come quickly as sister Zara has ruined her condition by crying continuously
[13:33] why, what happened?
I don't know, lets go

As if I had found you?
[13:39] Zara... Zara, what happened?
[13:43] Fareeha, where have you been?
[13:45] neither today's clothes are ready, nor of any other function. You had to look after all this
[13:50] and that tailor! I have been calling him since so long, but he has switched off his phone
[13:56] So, I'm handling it. He had told me that he'll deliver the clothes by 4 pm. How can he switch off his phone like this
[14:02] don't you worry
[14:03] how can I not worry? The guests will be here within 2 hours
[14:06] what will I wear?
[14:08] you have so many clothes, you can wear anything
[14:10] Billo!
[14:12] our Zara cannot wear her old clothes at any of her function
[14:16] don't worry, let me fix that old tailor. Let me bring your dress right away

[14:36] what will we do now?
[14:39] Billo! look over there, Maqsood's bike
[14:42] Bike? But who will ride a bike? I don't even know how to use it
[14:45] I will ride it

[16:06] oh no, what's wrong. I have just helped you in making the setup of this gym
[16:11] rest is your hard work, my cheetah
[16:13] now you'll see, once you'll enter in your father's business I am sure you'll take it to the heights
[16:21] oh brother, that's the problem
[16:24] dad doesn't want to change anything
[16:26] and the most important thing is that I know how much potential this business have
[16:30] its requires an update & upgrade
[16:32] so you'll update it
[16:34] leave it
[16:36] neither dad understands my ideas, nor I understand his words
[16:39] since I had promised mom & Kiran
[16:42] that after graduation, I will sit at the catering business with dad. So I am fulfilling it
[16:47] otherwise, its difficult for both of us to stay on the same page

[24:59] you know that area's SHO, right?
[25:00] that's best! Don't spare them

[25:05] ladies are coming with flying scarf, & we had accident
[25:15] if something happened to him then I swear to God I won't leave them
[25:19] listen to me! No matter what happen, these people shouldn't come out of the lock-up
[25:24] ill-mannered people! Don't know from where they come
[25:27] sister... why aren't we going back home? His cousin is so furious that he is taking the matter to the police
[25:35] why is he calling the police? We haven't done anything deliberately

[26:10] lets just inquire then we'll leave
[26:17] have you gained back your conscience?
[26:28] what are you searching for?
[26:30] where is she?
[26:32] who?
[26:33] she...
[26:36] was it a dream?
[26:44] I have never seen such a beautiful dream
[26:46] you got an injury on the knee, so had it affected your brain?
[26:50] forget her while considering it a horrible dream
[26:52] She had left after ruining you!
[26:54] I was telling you to call the police at that time, but No...
[26:59] don't know what does these rich people think of themselves
[27:01] but she was on the bike like us, how do you know that she was rich?
[27:04] we get to know from one's attitude
[27:07] She must be a spoiled daughter of some rich father
[27:11] if she had been a spoil daughter of some rich father, then she would have left us on the road.
[27:13] She wouldn't have brought us to the hospital
[27:15] what rubbish you are uttering, just find her
[27:17] how would I know that where she is
[27:22] excuse me!
[27:24] keep lying down
[27:26] you are still here?
[27:31] I just wanted to know if there isn't anything serious
[27:36] No
[27:39] I will never let you get worried
[27:42] are you fine now? 
Is he fine?
[27:44] yes, he is fine. He just got a few stitches on his knee due to injury
[27:49] the doctor had advised to keep him here for tonight for monitoring
[27:53] Okay
[27:54] Thank God! I was so scared
[28:00] you are so sweet
[28:05] See...
[28:07] it was an accident, I haven't done anything deliberately
[28:11] I was saying you at that time as well, that let me call the police or pay for your loss but..
[28:17] at that time, my brother was fine
[28:19] now he has become more fine
[28:23] lets do one thing, lets settle this matter within ourselves
[28:29] don't call the police, please
[28:31] Please don't call the police, otherwise there will be a lot of problem in my family
[28:35] police?
[28:37] yes, he was saying it very loudly outside that they'll lock us in the lock up & won't let us leave
[28:43] who was saying that?
[28:46] Since you were in a lot of pain, so I had said it in anger
[28:50] are you in pain?
[28:51] No no, its little bit due to stitches
[28:55] by the way, I can endure a lot of pain. As I am so daring
[28:59] yes
[29:02] Can I do something for you?
[29:05] please let me know if I can do anything for you
[29:08] No no
[29:11] are you sure that you won't call the police?
[29:15] it will never happen
[29:19] thank you!
[29:22] welcome!
[29:30] sister, I am going downstairs. Please come quickly, I am waiting
[29:40] hey move your rickshaw! What is this way?
[29:45] illiterate, ill-mannered people!
[29:47] don't you have any sense?
[29:48] when there is no space, so can't you see? 
You are just barging in!
[29:52] if anything would have happened now, then who would have paid for the loss?
[29:54] you are such an ill-mannered guy. Don't you have any manners to talk?
[29:57] you! Now you'll teach me manners?
[29:59] it doesn't seem that you are capable enough to learn manners
[30:02] you are using such a big car, but look at you small heart like a mouse
[30:05] hey! stop your rubbish. Got it?
[30:08] Instead of feeling sorry for doing something wrong, you are exulting in it?
That's the problem!
[30:11] you guys roam on the road just like that
[30:14] first of all you guys hit the big cars & then pretends to be oppressed ones
[30:17] and say, "please forgive us, as I am a poor guy"
[30:20] Disgusting, move!
[30:22] You have been uttering rubbish since so long & I have been listening to you!
[30:26] it would be better for you to leave from here quietly
[30:28] be quiet, no need to argue much
[30:30] will you threaten me? Have you seen your worth?
[30:33] if I want, I can get you imprisoned right away
[30:36] hey relax! burden on this earth
[30:39] what do you want to do? Do whatever you can
[30:42] I will ruin you within a second, got it?
[30:44] leave quietly as I am in a hurry
[30:46] after all who you are? Illiterate man!
[30:48] Disgusting person, move away!
[30:54] Okay then, take care of yourself
[30:57] get well soon
thank you!
[31:11] Bye!

[31:21] yes? All fine now?
[31:25] I am
[31:26] stop it now
[31:29] you are gone
[31:31] uncle is here
[31:38] hey, uncle is here
[31:41] what was the need to call dad here?
[31:43] you are in a hospital, what I would have informed at home? It was important
[31:47] now I am completely gone!
[31:50] lye down
[31:53] my child's name is Farhad
uncle is here!
[31:59] where is Farhad?
he is sleeping
[32:10] are his bones alright?
[32:12] yes...
what are the doctors saying?
[32:14] They are saying, he'll be fine by tomorrow evening. Nothing to worry about
[32:19] where were you guys roaming around?
[32:21] oh uncle, it was an accident. It wasn't our mistake
[32:25] whose mistake it was? If it was someone else's mistake then you should have called the police
[32:29] it was the mistake of both
[32:31] they were coming in the speed, and we were in a speed too. And we couldn't apply the brakes
[32:35] he is sleeping, but you come with me outside
[32:38] why uncle?
let me tell you
[32:40] you guys are roaming around in the entire city like hooligans
[32:44] come outside, let me fix you
but uncle...
[33:13] yes, I am understanding your point but...
[33:17] I have already told you that my father doesn't want to sell the shop
[33:20] Oh! its not about the money, what do you they say....
[33:26] yes! his sentimental value is quite attached with the shop
[33:30] still I will talk to him
[33:52] dad
[33:54] I am really sorry, I had gone to pick up Zara's dress
[33:57] I have heard you, but what was the need for you to do such a dangerous thing?
[34:02] why did you go on a bike?
[34:05] there wasn't any car, dad...
so you should have called one
[34:08] you are always in such a hurry
[34:12] its quite dangerous!
[34:14] you are my only daughter
[34:17] what if something would have happened to you, then?
[34:20] are you crazy!
[34:24] I am really sorry dad, it will never happen again. I promise
[34:28] Promise chu...
[34:33] I did a very big mistake by not teaching you guys Gujrati language
[34:38] what is this promise chu?
[34:39] I swear!
[34:41] Wrong! Wrong answer
[34:43] what? How can it be wrong, dad?
[34:47] listen to me, I know Gujrati
[34:51] here you go
[34:53] See... 'Keem cho', it means "how are you"
[34:57] 'maja ma', means "I am fine"
[34:58] 'Geelo', it means "crazy" which I am
[35:02] you have said it 100% correct
[35:05] ok listen! there is no need to tell anything to anyone inside. Ok?
[35:08] even I haven't told them. I have explained him too, got it?
[35:11] now see, they'll create a fuss for no reason. And there is already a function in the house
[35:16] got it?
yes
[35:18] is it our little secret?
yes, our secret
[35:21] I know, you did this with good intention
[35:24] but my daughter look, sometimes we endure loss by listening to our heart
[35:29] got it?
[35:31] now come on, make a long face as if I have scolded you guys a lot
[35:35] come on, you too. Come in the front, & stop laughing
[35:43] Greetings!
[35:44] where have you guys been?
[35:47] We had gone to pick up Zara's dress from the tailor master
[35:53] her bike broke down, so I had picked them
[35:56] Saqib got to know that you guys had gone on the bike
[35:59] he is so furious!
[36:03] what as such calamity it was that you guys had to go on a bike?
[36:06] are you crazy? You took her on the bike?
[36:08] actually brother Saqib...
don't you know how bad the situation is of our city?
[36:12] don't you have any brains?
[36:18] what is the mistake of this poor child, why are you scolding him?
[36:21] don't you know, nobody can say anything in this house in front of Fareeha
[36:25] and you! You got my son scolding
[36:30] dad, this is the limit
[36:31] first of all, she took the bike in the evening time & upon having a problem she calls you to pick up
[36:35] why she didn't call me?
[36:36] I had told everything to dad
[36:38] so will someone tell me something in this house or not!
[36:40] be quiet, as she said that she had informed me already. And I have explained her
[36:44] there is a function in the house right now, so don't spoil the environment
[36:48] go dear, get ready for the function
[36:50] dad, you have spoiled her a lot
[36:52] As I said stop it, so what is the problem now?
[36:55] end of discussion!
[37:00] everyone is just getting angry here
[37:04] hey listen!
[37:05] I just brought it, kindly give this to Zara from our side
[37:10] Okay
[37:12] dad...
[37:14] we have gifted a set on every function, at least charge the cost price
[37:19] are you in your senses, crazy! will I take the charges from my family?
[37:24] never say this again
[37:26] come on go & get ready
[37:41] what happened, haven't you got ready?
[37:46] what is this?
[37:49] this is a new set, as you had ordered
[37:54] will I wear this in the wedding ceremony?
[37:56] Yousuf Motiwala's daughter-in-law, your wife.. who is a jeweler
[38:00] will I become a joke by wearing this?
[38:03] dad had selected it
[38:05] yes yes! because dad is spending everything on others
[38:08] he gets very heavy jewelry for his daughter & niece, but he is giving me such a light weight set to me!
[38:13] oh my dear...
[38:16] if its in my control, then I shall cover you with jewelry from head to toe
[38:19] that's the problem that nothing is in your control
[38:21] dad doesn't listens to you at all, and nobody listens to you at the shop as well
[38:27] nobody gives you an importance in this house as an eldest son
[38:30] and there your dearest sister! She does whatever comes in her mind
[38:33] and whenever you say something, nobody listens to you
[38:37] its not like that
[38:39] I do have my own reverence
[38:41] leave it! You couldn't even bring a nice good set from your shop
[38:46] and here you'll show your reverence!
[38:47] oh my dear...
[38:49] I'll make sure that nobody gets the amount of jewelry you had got at your wedding
[38:55] And, let dad do whatever he wants to
[38:58] As it is, after him everything belongs to you & me
[39:02] A lot of people in this house have their eyes on this
[39:05] I know
[39:06] I know how to keep them in their limits, ok?
[39:10] hey..
[39:12] don't spoil your mood
[39:15] Ok tell me what do you want? Just point it out
[39:18] I will bring the stars for you from the sky, yet this jewelry is such an ordinary thing
[39:24] now fix your mood
[39:28] Till date, I haven't asked you for anything
[39:31] your love is enough for me
[39:34] why do I care to interfere in your family matters
[39:37] I say, 'do good and seek no reward'
[39:40] but I can't see that anyone takes advantage of our dad's good deeds
[39:45] I know that..
[39:47] only we can save him, otherwise people will eat him away. I know that very well
[39:53] fix your mood & quickly get ready
[39:56] Ok?
[39:57] Come on, get ready & smile
[40:00] Come on
[40:09] finally you did it!
[40:11] So, is there a possibility that I promise about something & don't fulfill it?
[40:15] thank you!
[40:18] are you saying 'thank you' to your sister?
[40:20] Come here, you are looking so pretty just like a doll
[40:23] sit down, where are the flowers?
[40:25] here they are
[40:28] take it
[40:30] you'll see, there won't be any sort of lacking in your wedding
[40:35] whatever you feel like just order it, I will bring it to you like a magician
[40:41] by the way, how will I live without you?
[40:45] I am feeling scared
[40:47] what if there would be any problem at my in-laws house, then?
[40:50] So what? You should come here immediately
[40:53] I & dad will fix them. And listen...
[40:57] there is no need to listen to any unjustified words from anyone, got it?
[41:02] it doesn't happen this way
[41:04] during such times, people say... "do compromise, listen to your elders"
[41:08] "you should serve your husband" and don't know what more suggestions they give
[41:12] the compromise needs to be done from both the sides
[41:14] that's why I have said that there is no need to listen to any unjustified words from anyone
[41:20] look, if they are good with you then we are good with them
[41:23] and if they are bad with you then we...
[41:25] Enough! I have understood everything
[41:28] by the way, you won't feel scared at all while going to your in-laws house
[41:32] in fact, I will be more concerned about them instead of you
[41:35] so, what shall I do? I am like that
[41:37] its not in everyone's control to live with me
[41:40] So, if anyone has the courage then he shall come in the front
[41:44] you are looking so pretty, all praise to God!
[41:46] How does mom do? The way they put some kajal...
[41:51] so pretty...
shall we go now?
[41:53] yes...
lets go!
[41:55] come on
[43:01] yes, greetings! City Hospital?
[43:04] I wanted to take an update of the patient who came to your hospital after an accident
[43:12] what!
[43:16] he died?
[43:19] he died at this age?
