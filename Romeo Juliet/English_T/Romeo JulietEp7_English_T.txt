[00:14] Mother you have depression.
[00:19] There is no shame in accepting this fact.
[00:24] If you had accepted this before...
[00:31] then you might have gotten the help you needed earlier.
[00:36] What more do you want than her broken arm?
[00:41] A woman has to tolerate.
[00:44] You will not understand that.
[00:46] Please let him come inside.
[00:53] I want to talk to him as well.
[01:01] You said that you could handle her
[01:05] What happened?
[01:08] We lost our golden sparrow. You couldn't even get a car out of her.
[01:14] What will we do if we lose the catering business?
[01:20] Why are you standing there idly? Tell us, what should we do?
[01:23] Don't worry.
[01:26] Nothing will happen.
[01:30] She will not go anywhere.
[01:35] She will come to me.
[01:43] Auntie...
[01:47] I didn't even think of divorce.
[01:53] I just asked for time to solve our problems.
[01:57] Time to think what we want from each other.
[02:02] I thought that he would have missed me all this time we were away...
[02:14] Is this what he thought of?
[02:17] Is it so easy to end a relationship which we fought against the world to have?
[02:24] Is he that weak?
[02:35] It's not for everyone to maintain relationships.
[02:44] This is all the strength that he had.
[02:53] No auntie.
[02:56] We are not the ones who lose strength.
[03:00] This cannot be how this ends.
[03:09] Time...
[03:10] is cruel.
[03:14] It shifts the life in an instance.
[03:18] When a storm passes...
[03:22] then things don't stay the same...
[03:29] and people don't stay the same.
[03:36] You have to be strong to take these decisions...
[04:03] I knew that this would happen.
[04:06] When I explained it to them, they thought that I was their enemy.
[04:10] My parents didn't listen to me, nor did my sister.
[04:13] Let them do as they please.
[04:17] Why are you cursing yourself?
[04:20] She chose to do what she did and she should now deal with it.
[04:24] The guy is ruining my sister's life.
[04:28] Your sister died for you when she ran away to marry him.
[04:36] You are right.
[04:38] She died the day she ran away from home.
[04:43] Then stop blaming yourself. She is responsible for what she did.
[04:48] One more thing, before Fariha's divorce begins, I want you to talk to father again.
[04:54] I don't our future to be compromised because of this divorce.
[05:01] I'll talk to him.
[05:03] This time there will be no talk...
[05:06] You will decide, because I don't want anymore delays...
[05:09] What do you want me to do? Should I sell this house?
[05:15] You're acting like a kid.
I am not! I'm telling you the truth.
[05:20] And if you don't do this now, I'll go to my brother's.
[05:24] Why do you always bring that up?
[05:27] Everything is in front of you but still you bring this up.
[05:33] I am trying...
[05:36] I've heard enough, now is the time to act.
[05:50] What hell is this!
[05:53] Farhad... come in.
[05:57] It's time for your medicine.
[06:00] The doctors said that you need to have it ever six hours.
[06:05] Here you go...
[06:08] Come on...
[06:11] Here.
[06:22] Here you are... it has turmeric in it... drink it...
[06:32] Good...
[06:34] You need to have this soup as well.
[06:45] Thank you.
[06:47] For giving me strength.
[06:51] You never liked Shah-zain.
[06:56] It was I who wanted him.
[07:00] Shah-zain...
[07:04] Look at me today.
[07:10] All of us our helpless at the moment.
[07:15] What did you do? Jojo told me.
[07:21] Why didn't you apologize to Fariha? I'm sure you could have convinced mother.
[07:29] It's not about mother.
[07:34] It's my problem.
[07:39] I am not worthy of her forgiveness.
[07:46] Hey...
[07:50] Listen to me carefully...
[07:54] You're not father.
[07:58] And you will not become like father.
[08:03] Don't punish yourself for them.
[08:07] Your life is incomplete without Fariha.
[08:11] But hers is complete without me.
Come on!
[08:15] Shut up and have this apple.
[08:18] Rest up, we'll talk later.
[08:27] You need to take the next dose after six hours...
[08:57] Hey... sorry..
[09:01] Sorry I was late. How's your mother feeling now?
[09:04] Mother is well now, she's home now.
Really...
[09:07] Thank God... what did the doctors say? Is everything alright?
[09:12] One tends to have more than one illness at her age.
[09:15] Yes, that's true.
[09:17] I have my fair share of problems as well.
[09:20] Sorry you had to sit in the sun because of me.
[09:25] It's like I'm destined to stand in line... first it's the hospital...
[09:29] sometime it's work...
Why are you saying that?
[09:33] I'll have a key made and I'll give it to you..
[09:37] So that you can enter when I'm not around.
[09:42] No... there is no need for that.
[09:46] I'll wait... I don't want this responsibility.
[09:50] It's just a key, I'm not asking you to clean up inside.
[09:55] Women have rights...
[09:59] You will not stand in the sun.. I'll give you this key.
[10:01] As you wish.
[10:04] Did you have breakfast?
[10:06] You didn't have breakfast before coming to the gym?
[10:09] Let's have breakfast first...
Alright.
[10:16] You've taken a great decision.
[10:18] Once you talk to him he'll convince you.
[10:22] He talks in a weird way but... he's here.
[10:27] Greetings*
[10:30] I'm well.. how are you?
[10:33] Sir... life can't be spent being well all the time.
[10:37] To live life one needs money!
[10:43] Yes... you're right.
[10:46] The thing is that we have bought all the shops in the market, yours is the only one that is left.
[10:55] A bulldozer doesn't know that this shop belongs to you.
[11:00] When you've bought the entire market...
[11:03] then why do you need mine?
[11:07] We will demolish all these shops here and then we'll make a shopping mall.
[11:14] You are my memon brother that's why I'm talking to you respectfully, otherwise...
[11:20] Really.... otherwise how would have talked to me?
[11:22] Brother Yousuf there are many ways, but it would be better if you don't find out about them.
[11:34] Alright fine, I'll think about it and revert to you.
[11:38] My ears are tired listening to this. Why did you call me here?
[11:42] I thought that I would be coming here to sign a deal. You wasted my time.
[11:46] Why did you invite me here then?
[11:49] You will have to empty the shop. I'll show you.
[11:56] What did you do father?
[12:00] He was giving us a great offer... what do you want?
[12:03] Did you hear how he was talking? He was talking like a gangster.
[12:08] Should I give him my shop?
He's from our brotherhood.
[12:12] There can bad people in our brotherhood.
[12:16] You're not understanding father, once we sell our shop to him...
[12:20] it doesn't matter who has our land. We can buy a new shop with that money.
[12:24] I know everything, understand?
[12:30] It's plain and simple father, he will take this shop away from us..
[12:34] We're getting good money for it. We'll gain nothing by fighting him.
[12:41] I understand now... greed...
[12:45] makes one a coward. One forget their values.
[12:50] He sells them too
[12:54] I'm going to pray... think about what I said.
[13:28] Forgive me Kiran...
[13:33] Please listen to me one more time...
[13:37] Who is it?
[13:41] Mother...
[13:45] Mother... forgive me...
[13:49] Forgive me... I don't know how I do this?
[13:55] I regret it later, forgive me.
[13:59] Get up son...
No... hit me...
[14:03] What I did to your daughter was wrong.
[14:07] I have sinned... please hit me.
[14:12] Kiran... ever since you left home I haven't eaten properly.
[14:17] I can't sleep... I can't work... please don't leave me.
[14:21] Please make her understand... I'll change myself for you.
[14:29] I promise... I will change myself for you.
[14:33] Whenever I'll get angry, I distance myself from you.
[14:37] I will not say an harsh words. Just give me one more chance.
[14:43] Kiran... only your love can change me.
[14:50] If you don't forgive me... I will have no place to go.
Shah-zain...
[14:59] Please get up...
[15:02] and go.
Kiran.
[15:04] You know how much I love you.
[15:10] If you don't forgive me for the rest of my life...
[15:14] then I'll ask for you forgiveness for the rest of my life, but I cannot leave you.
[15:19] Please... forgive me just this once.
[15:24] Shah-zain get up.
[15:27] The people are watching... get up.
[15:33] Kiran listen to what he's saying.
[15:41] I know...
[15:44] that you have a big heart.
[15:48] And you will forgive me one day.
[15:53] I'll wait for you.
[15:55] When you think the time is right, return home.
[16:23] How many people are there at your home?
At home...
[16:28] I have an ill mother and two blind sisters.
[16:34] And your father?
Father was a fisherman...
[16:38] He drowned when I was a child.
[16:43] I'm sorry to hear that.
[16:46] I am not...
[16:49] Father used to hit us when we were kids.
[16:55] It's good he died, if he hadn't we would have drowned him today.
[17:01] If you hadn't given me this job...
[17:06] then I wonder what might have happened to my ill mother and two blind sisters.
[17:12] Don't worry... everything will be alright.
[17:16] Ever since you've come into my life...
[17:22] everything has been going great.
[17:26] What do you mean?
[17:33] Madam... shall we start the session?
[17:35] Yes... the girls are here... I'll start my class.
[17:40] Alright?
Sure.
[17:45] What did that girl had to come here right this instance!
[17:55] Auntie may I come in?
Come in...
[17:59] Are you going somewhere?
[18:01] Yes... Khalid's friend has invited us to dinner.
[18:05] We're going there...
[18:10] Is this too much?
[18:13] No... you look beautiful.
[18:17] Are you still worried. Everything will be alright?
[18:23] Yes... I came to tell you that I'm go outside for a while. I'll be back quickly.
[18:29] Where are you going?
[18:34] I was going home.
[18:36] I don't whether I should call that place home or not.
[18:39] How will you go there alone? Let me come with you.
[18:43] No... it's okay. I'll go alone. Enjoy your dinner.
[18:49] I'm grown up now... I can manage.
[18:53] Go ahead... I'll be back early. Don't worry.
[19:06] Everyone who comes to the gum reeks of sweat.
[19:09] I've made a rule, no one will enter without apply a body spray.
[19:12] You're the one who has taught me this.
[19:15] I think brother Yousuf is the one who should talk about this.
[19:20] Secondly, Fariha is a guest at her home.
[19:23] As as host we shouldn't say such things. She is not a burden on us.
[21:08] It would have been better if I had rotted in jail!
[23:41] Why is everything so silent? Where's everyone?
[23:46] I think it's the the effect I'm having.
[23:52] Whatever I touch turns to ash.
[23:56] You're always so sad, think about how we can reel in customers.
[24:02] Don't you think I think about that? Should I force people to come here?
[24:11] After father's death...
[24:14] the customer's connection with the business has abruptly ended...
[24:19] So... let's reconnect them.
[24:23] Did you take feedback from the people who are sitting outside?
[24:28] They are regular customers.
[24:31] Will you wait for them to leave? When someone leaves my gym...
[24:36] I call and ask them about what happened.
[24:40] I ask them why they left?
[24:43] Someone told me that the place reeks of sweat.
[24:46] I've made a rule that anyone who comes to gym will have to apply body spray first.
[24:49] You're the one who taught me this.
[24:52] And now you've forgotten it.
[24:55] Use your brain... and work hard. You'll get all of your answers.
[25:25] Did you think of something?
[25:37] Excuse me sir... is everything okay?
[25:44] Is the taste okay?
[25:53] What I mean to say is that do you have any complaints?
[26:03] Meaning, everything is fine?
[26:15] Sir, do you feel a change?
[26:21] We want to understand why our customers have lessened.
[26:25] Otherwise our business was always so busy at this hour.
[26:28] yes
[26:30] I don't know...
[26:35] Sorry sir for disturbing you, please continue.
[26:38] It's good but...
[26:41] there is something missing.
[26:44] What is that?
[26:48] I don't know, but there is something missing.
[26:54] I come to eat here daily. My shop is just around the corner.
[26:57] I used to talk to Mr. Yaqub daily.
[27:00] It's a force of habit to come here... maybe that's what everyone else is missing.
[27:08] Sir... is it the spice that is less...
[27:14] or you don't like the taste of the food.
[27:17] There's nothing wrong... it's just I'm not feeling it...
[27:20] How can we add feelings to the food?
[27:23] What did your father do?
[27:32] Fariha my dear...
[27:34] Love is love.
[27:38] It is a part of our soul.
[27:43] Sometimes it get weak...
[27:47] But it doesn't die... love never dies.
[27:52] I've realized one thing... we cannot sacrifice our families again.
[28:01] It's been a long time since my father hugged me...
[28:06] I don't want to lose his love again.
[28:13] What about Farhad?
[28:21] Maybe what everyone says is right...
[28:28] Love isn't enough for marriage...
[28:32] Fariha...
[28:36] I don't know what will happen to you and Farhat...
[28:42] but I would like to tell you something. The bond that we have with you...
[28:49] will never end.
[28:51] You are like our daughter.
[28:55] The doors to our home and hearts are always open to you.
[28:58] You can come here anytime you want.
[29:01] Thank you so much.
[29:05] I'll get going.
[29:07] Farewell.
[29:26] Bless you my dear.
[29:31] Sit down.
[29:32] Are you okay?
[29:34] I'm okay, how's everyone at home?
[29:40] Everyone is fine.
[29:48] Father...
[29:53] I miss all of you.
[29:59] Can I go back home with your guys?
[30:08] I wanted to tell you some good news.
[30:14] Saqib is about to become a father.
[30:17] Really... I'm about to become an aunt?
[30:21] I want to meet him.
[30:38] I...
[30:41] I know that brother Saqib is angry with me...
[30:45] But I will ask for his forgiveness. Maybe he'll forgive me.
[30:50] Yes...
[30:54] You don't know...
[30:56] but right now things are tense at home.
[31:01] If you go there, Saqib will leave home.
[31:11] Unfortunately...
[31:15] fate has brought us to a place...
[31:20] where we have to choose between our two children.
[31:32] I understand.
[31:36] This was caused by me, and it's my responsibility to fix it.
[31:43] Please give me one more chance... I want to ask for his forgiveness.
[31:48] Maybe I might have an effect.
[31:54] Sure... we'll give you that chance.
[32:05] Are you well?
[32:47] You're so busy nowadays at the gym, we don't get the time to talk.
[32:53] I'm bust too... I don't get the chance as well.
[32:57] Mr. Jojo, we have to work...
[33:02] Ever since you've come into my life, my day can't go on without seeing you.
[33:07] You've become my support
[33:09] I could never have divided the work load like you have.
[33:15] I have a brother named Farhad, whatever I am today is because of him.
[33:20] He supported me, like you're supporting me now.
[33:25] You've never introduced me to your brother Farhad...
[33:29] I wanted to... but he's quite off nowadays.
[33:33] He did come once or twice, but you weren't available then.
[33:36] I wanted to mention you, but he was going through some trouble...
[33:40] I didn't think it was appropriate.
[33:43] The way you praise him...
[33:46] I can't wait to meet him.
[33:48] He's an amazing guy, he'll become your favorite once you meet him.
[33:53] I'll introduce you to him as soon as I get the chance.
[34:03] If you don't mind, might I say something?
[34:06] Why are you being so formal? Why would I mind?
[34:13] What if we go out for dinner somewhere.
[34:20] It's okay if you don't want to go... I made a mistake by saying it... I'm sorry.
[34:28] Wait... I lost my handsfree...
[34:32] I don't mind... let me know when you plan on going.
[34:39] Oh...
[34:44] I do have one condition... I will pay for the bill.
[34:48] What do you mean?
[34:50] It's settled then, that's the condition.
[34:55] Here you are...
[34:57] Wow... I thought that this would be enough for me.
[35:03] Sit down.
[35:08] Is Fariha not coming for dinner?
[35:11] I went to get her...
[35:15] She's refusing to come.
[35:19] She said that she doesn't feel like it.
[35:24] This way she'll get more weak.
[35:30] I don't understand anything. What's going on?
[35:37] We are being tested by God, don't worry, everything will be alright.
[35:45] Fariha is not fine.
[35:49] It seems that something is eating away inside of her.
[35:55] Her eyes have lost their shine.
[36:01] Shaggo, for Fariha this is not ordinary circumstances...
[36:07] She is going through a tough period...
[36:11] people even with the strongest will power...
[36:15] break under circumstances. She is dealing with it patiently though.
[36:21] I was thinking of talking that brother Yousuf...
[36:27] should take Fariha home with her for a few days.
[36:31] She would be happy there amongst people... over here...
[36:35] she remains silent.
[36:36] I don't think you should talk to brother Yousuf about this.
[36:42] Why? Why shouldn't I?
[36:44] Look... listen to me... the first thing is we don't know how Saqib sees this issue...
[36:54] I think that brother Yousuf should talk about this...
[36:58] The second thing is that Fariha is our guest
[37:02] and as her host it's not appropriate for us to say such things.
[37:06] Is she a burden on us?
[37:10] Besides... Fariha...
[37:14] is not an emotional position to understand anything.
[37:18] What ever you tell her now she'll take the wrong meaning out of it and I don't want that to happen.
[37:25] This is her home, as well as brother Yousuf's. 
[37:28] She can live here as long as she wants.
[37:32] Alright?
[37:37] Sometimes I think what would happen...
[37:44] if you weren't in my life...
[37:46] Then you would have been eating cold food.
[37:50] Alright fine...
[37:53] I have some poetry?
[37:56] The one that you recited on our wedding day?
You didn't like that one.
[38:01] I have something new...
[38:03] Sure go ahead...
[38:07] A box inside a box and inside that box is a cake... you're laughing... I wont' continue...
[38:15] What do you mean? What's inside that box?
[38:19] A box inside a box and inside that box is a cake.
[38:24] It's for kids but...
What?
[38:27] And you are one in a million...
