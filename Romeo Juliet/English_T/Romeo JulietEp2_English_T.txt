[01:52] Sir, there is someone named Shamim outside, here to meet you
[01:55] Who Shamim?
[01:57] She said she's a relative.
[02:00] Oh God.. Call her inside.
[02:02] Alright.
[02:05] Who is it? Why did you call her inside?
[02:07] How would I know? But we do have people with pet names. She might be someone.
[02:11] And if I tell them we didn't recognize you, we'll be insulted.
[02:20] You?
[02:23] Why are you here?
[02:25] I'm here to talk to Fariha.
[02:28] For God's sake forgive us.
[02:31] My daughter is trying to come out of this problem after a lot of difficulty.
[02:35] Now don't pull her into this quicksand anymore. Please!
[02:40] Please sit down first. Please.
[02:58] I didn't come here to create any more problems for Fariha.
[03:09] I am here to apologize to Fariha.
[03:12] Dad, I..
[03:19] Hello.
[03:23] Hello.
[03:31] I misbehaved with you.
[03:39] I talked trash
[03:44] but you didn't answer me back, once.
[03:51] Today, I'm here to apologize to you.
[04:07] You want a divorce.
[04:11] Whatever your decision is.. we'll accept it.
[04:19] Maybe this was what I wanted on the inside.
[04:23] To have your relationship broken by any means.
[04:34] Or maybe I cast an evil eye on you people.
[04:47] Whatever happened in our lives..
[04:52] I accused you for everything.
[04:58] Now I understand that it was all my fault.
[05:06] But I blamed you.
[05:13] I just came here to apologize.
[05:22] My heart was burdened.
[05:28] Problems will never end in our lives.
[05:35] Your father was in our house that Farhad was taken away.
[05:42] We were in a rush that we didn't get a chance to say anything.
[05:47] I'm here to clear everything.
[05:51] Farhad didn't have anything to do with all this. He's innocent.
[05:57] Actually, my son in law turned out to be a nuisance.
[06:06] He mistreated my daughter a lot.
[06:16] Yaqoob named his catering business to Kiran.
[06:24] That's why he isn't letting her go. To take over the business, Shahzain,
[06:33] gave someone money to contaminate the food.
[06:41] And now Farhad is suffering because of it.
[06:50] Farhad is a very good brother.
[06:54] He has always been Kiran's shield.
[06:59] We're uneducated people.
[07:05] We thought a divorce was never an option and this is why Shahzain has become mortal enemies with Farhad.
[07:18] He wants to destroy him.
[07:25] The catering business has never been Yaqoob's business only.
[07:32] He used to say it was his legacy. His tradition,
[07:38] and everything else was linked to this business.
[07:44] He would say he had to honor the name even if there was not much money in it.
[07:53] And now without even wanting, Farhad is associated with it.
[08:01] He's trying to save it.
[08:05] I don't have any right to say anything to you, but,
[08:16] I think I should have come earlier.
[08:21] Farhad loves you very much.
[08:25] More than any of us.
[08:30] I cannot look at his condition.
[08:34] He cannot breathe.
[08:39] He is alive but he has lost his spark.
[08:48] If you have any space in your heart,
[08:53] please forgive me.
[08:59] May you live long.
[09:03] I'll take your leave now.
[09:16] Dad, you didn't do right.
[09:32] Dear, Fariha, we just want to protect you. You,
[09:39] are already disturbed and now another problem.
[09:44] Its better if you stay away from all of it.
[09:48] Mom, my husband is in jail for a fraud case and you're suggesting, I leave him alone.
[09:57] We just want the best for you.
[09:59] If you want the best for me, let me make my mistakes and then correct them myself.
[10:08] I know parents want to shield their parents but you people cannot protect me forever.
[10:16] Do you know, during my wedding, I was burdened with the fact that I had hurt my parents.
[10:21] I hurt everybody to make one new relationship.
[10:26] You people tell me. Should you punish someone so harshly if they decide for themselves?
[10:33] Your life will be very difficult with him.
[10:37] Wasn't yours mom?
[10:40] No relationship is perfect mom. We have to make it perfect.
[10:46] Will you always be running towards the court and police station all your life?
[10:52] Why do you want to put yourself in this test? Why don't you tell her?
[10:57] Mom, do you both want me to not live with Farhad?
[11:02] Okay? I promise that my relationship with Farhad is over.
[11:10] Is that what you people want?
[11:12] I know I cannot live without my family.
[11:17] And if you people have this condition even today.
[11:22] I will not break your heart again but I cannot leave him like this in jail right now. Please.
[11:36] Stay away from him. Its best for you.
[11:41] Mom, I'm telling you. Think of my relationship with Farhad as finished.
[11:51] But the character test starts after a relationship has ended.
[11:59] My conscience doesn't allow me to let him rot in jail please.
[12:06] Whether you help him or not, I will.
[12:12] Dad..
[12:15] Am I saying something wrong?
[12:18] If yes, please stop me.
[12:20] I'll stay back if you tell me to.
[12:38] Sir, hello. I want to meet Farhad Karim Baksh.
[12:43] You cannot meet him right now.
Why?
[12:45] The boss isn't here right now.
But you're here sir.
[12:49] I just need to meet him for a little while, sir. I'm his wife.
[12:52] I told you, you cannot meet him right now. Come in the evening.
[12:54] Sir please.
[12:58] Alright but I'll allow you for five minutes.
[13:00] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[13:07] Farhad, your wife is here to see you.
[13:35] Farhad?
[13:40] Farhad?
[13:44] Farhad, at least talk to me.
[13:50] How can I talk to you, Fariha?
[13:57] You were right.
[14:02] I should stay here.
[14:07] This is the return of what I did.
[14:12] Don't say that. I have regrets too.
Regrets?
[14:24] Regrets make you miss times that have passed, Fariha.
[14:35] I'm sorry, Fariha.
[14:41] I couldn't give you the happiness you deserved.
[14:48] There was a lot of happiness, Farhad.
[14:53] But I gave you more pain.
[14:58] Pain teaches us how to live whereas happiness makes you forget who you are.
[15:07] You'll get out of here soon. Alright?
[15:11] We'll talk then. Okay?
[15:19] No Fariha. I'm fine here.
[15:29] I don't have the right to ask you for anything but,
[15:37] if you can, please look at Kiran.
[15:40] Mam, you had five minutes. If sir comes, it'll be a problem.
[15:45] Please hurry up.
[16:06] Fariha, whatever happened between you two that day,
[16:11] I rushed out as I was and I even raised my hand on him.
[16:19] But Fariha, Farhad has been repenting since that day and trust me, he should repent too.
[16:27] Ever since that day, he has been punishing himself as he should.
[16:35] Fariha, believe me.
[16:37] The pain I've gone through,
[16:42] I'll never push any other woman knowingly into that hell.
[16:48] Whether it is my own brother in front of me.
[16:56] Shahzain made my life a living hell.
[17:03] Kiran, you cannot go back there.
[17:08] Farhad...
[17:09] Farhad will never be able to forgive himself. He cannot be free if you're imprisoned.
[17:15] Alright. What can I do then?
[17:18] I don't understand. You don't know Shahzain.
[17:24] He's psychotic. He's mad.
Because you gave him that power.
[17:31] Such people are habitual of suppressing those who can suppressed.
[17:35] Answer them once and they'll have sense knocked back into them.
[17:39] That man has hit every part of my body so many times that I forgot how many I counted. Just once..
[17:51] I answered him once and see what limit he went to.
[18:02] If you had answered him back on the first blow, he'd have never dared.
[18:06] There are oppressors in this world because people are oppressed.
[18:11] They are total cowards on the inside.
[18:20] And those who need to be taught by hand, will never listen to anything.
[18:24] Its time we take control of our lives, Kiran.
[18:55] Coming. Who is it at this hour?
[19:06] I knew you'd come.
[19:08] As it is, where would you go after leaving me?
[19:11] She'll go where she wants to.
[19:15] Oh, you brought her to advocate for you.
[19:19] Its too late for advocacy now. Its time to make a decision.
[19:24] Oh, come on. You people have lost your mind watching all that women empowerment.
[19:30] You, come inside.
[19:33] And you.. you go and beg the police and the judges to free your husband. Understand?
[19:42] Don't you hear me? What did I say? Come inside!
[19:46] Shahzain?
What Shahzain?
[19:50] You've grown wings? Have you lost your mind? Let me fix it. Should I?
[19:58] Oh.. you dare?! Ouch!
[20:07] I'll kill you.
[20:12] Not anymore.
[20:14] I will not let you. Do you know why?
[20:19] Because its the first time I'm not afraid, Shahzain.
[20:25] And when there's no fear, nobody can do anything. Not even you.
[20:32] I'll teach you a lesson right now.
[20:33] Stop it! Stop!
[20:38] Take your case back! You know you contaminated the food at the catering house.
[20:44] Yes, but you people have no proof.
[20:48] Your catering business will remain sealed.
[20:50] Until I name it to you? Farhad was right. Greedy people like you are never full.
[20:56] What do you two think? What do you think?
[21:00] You'll do all this and be free of me? Your brother will be free?
[21:06] No. No Kiran. I have just mishandled the catering business right now.
[21:14] Tomorrow, it'll be your life that I'll make hell.
[21:16] Its your life that will be made hell. Sign the divorce papers right away.
[21:22] And after today, if you even dare look at Farhad or his family, the video being made at the back with your confession,
[21:31] I'll make it go viral.
[21:33] I can show it to the police as well. But you've made a setting there.
[21:39] Its alright.
[21:42] You have two hours. Take back the fraud case against Farhad.
[21:48] Otherwise, if I come back here, you won't be able to stand on these legs of yours.
[23:06] Jojo..
[23:09] Did you see that wretched man anywhere?
[23:11] We won't be able to spot him anytime soon. If only you have dared to catch him earlier.
[23:16] Oh, I should have dared? You're putting it all on me.
[23:19] You act as a cheetah, you should have caught him that day.
[23:22] I took you there. You just had to catch him. Oh well.. where will he go?
[23:33] Jojo.. that guy!
[23:41] Don't let him go this time.
Stop your commentary and run after him.
[23:52] Oh.. so who told you?
Its not my fault.
[23:55] Its not my fault. It isn't.
Not yours? Then who told you?
[24:02] So you say this is the guy who contaminated the food at the catering house.
[24:06] Yes sir.
[24:07] You can check the record of the catering house. 
[24:09] We have never had a complain for bad food.
[24:13]  This is 100% done by our enemies. 
[24:16] They must have mixed something in the food.
Who?
[24:19] You ask him who told him to contaminate our food.
[24:24] Who do you work for?
[24:26] He looks like a thug from his face. Khuda Baksh, give him a taste of your hand.
[24:31] No. Please don't hit me. I'll tell you.
[24:33] I'll tell you the truth. I was sent by Shahzain.
[24:37] Shahzain told me to do it and he paid me for it as well.
[24:42] Alright, so this is Shahzain's cheap tactics. 
[24:46] Sir, unluckily, he's the son in law of the family.
[24:49] He wants to destroy the catering business.
[24:52] But how should be believe him?
[24:55] Sir, he is.
[24:57] But we'll investigate everything. We cannot just believe anybody on the road.
[25:06] Yes sir? Yes. I should close the case?
[25:15] Alright sir.
Sir..
[25:18] Khuda Baksh..
Sir?
[25:22] Bring his brother, whats his name.. Farhad. Let him go with him.
[25:28] And put this guy into the lockup.
[25:31] It's not my fault. I'm not responsible.
[25:36] Thank you sir.
[25:51] How is my friend?
[25:56] You don't have to worry about anything. I've settled everything. 
[26:00] Our business will be unsealed. Everything is easy.
[26:05] How did this happen? Did they take a lot of money?
[26:08] Leave the money. You come home I'll tell you everything.
[26:11] Everybody is waiting for you. Lets leave this weird place.
[26:22] Sorry. Sorry, its all my fault.
[26:30] What do you mean?
Shahzain, that idiot.
[26:37] Its all his doing. He wanted to take over the business and teach me a lesson.
[26:49] Don't worry. I'll do something. We'll see to him.
[26:53] What will you do? I've already settled everything.
[26:57] What do you think? How did you get out of jail?
[26:59] Because of me. I caught that guy and he told everything to the police.
[27:06] He tried to run like Usian Bolt but I turned out to be his father.
[27:13] I have stamina because of the gym. I ran so fast, I caught him.
[27:23] Good going my boy.
[27:32] And listen, you don't have to worry about Shahzain. He'll not bother us now.
[27:39] No but what did you do..
[27:44] I didn't do anything. 
[27:46] She did..
[28:05] Go on dear..
[28:12] You should talk in private.
[28:19] What did you people do? Jojo did everything. He ran so fast..
Of course.
[28:32] Well...
[28:37] You tell me.
No. You speak.
[28:48] How did you fix Shahzain?
With a stick.
[28:55] What do you mean with a stick?
[28:57] A stick means a stick. I hit him with it.
[29:02] You mean, you beat him with a real stick?
[29:06] Not only me but Kiran also hit him.
[29:09] Kiran too?
Yes. She deserved to hit him.
[29:17] And he didn't say anything?
[29:19] What would he say? He is a coward. Such people are big cowards.
[29:24] I hit him with a stick and all his ego subsided. 
[29:28] I recorded a video and he spilled everything about the catering business as well.
[29:33] I told I'd make the video viral and send it to the police and it fixed him.
[29:42] Wow.. You're a danger woman.
[29:46] You should have seen his face.
[29:48] He was walking with a lot of pomp and I hit him flat with a stick. Served him right.
[30:14] Fariha, can you forgive me?
[30:21] Fariha, I know I've built a lot of walls between us.
[30:27] But my anger was never towards you or our relationship.
[30:34] It was about the pain inside me for years. I could never handle it.
[30:44] I felt as if it was better if I stayed away from you but,
[30:52] I've only learnt one thing staying away from you.
[30:59] There's no life without you, Fariha.
[31:05] Your smile is my happiness.
[31:12] It doesn't make a difference whether I work a job, I run my business or look after the catering house.
[31:19] Whether I live in a small flat or a big house, nothing makes a difference to me.
[31:26] If you're not with me, it doesn't mean anything.
[31:34] My life is with you. 
[31:39] My love is with you.
[31:43] You're my dream. 
[31:48] There's nothing without you Fariha.
[31:58] Fariha.. will you give me a chance please?
[32:06] I'll always make you happy. I promise.
[32:14] Farhad, you were my love and you are my love.
[32:26] And you'll always be.
[32:32] But I love my family as well. 
[32:38] I cannot be divided in two parts.
[32:43] Fariha, I know I never treated your family well but I promise I'll never put you in any such situation.
[32:52] But my family has put me in such a situation. 
[32:55] I cannot break their hearts again.
[33:02] Farhad, we can love each other passionately but 
[33:07] marriage needs settling down and we don't have it in us.
[33:16] Sorry Farhad..
Fariha?
[33:23] Farhad, Romeo and Juliet are good for the books only 
[33:29] because they die before they're married.
[33:34] Maybe they know that marriage is no less than a death wish.
[33:44] This is the close of Fariha's and Farhad's love story.
[34:32] Fariha? Dear, where did you go? We were waiting for you.
[34:39] I've done what you wanted. 
[34:43] I've cut all ties with Farhad.
[34:48] I got him out of jail.
[34:55] And dad, we'll not have to go through anything. 
[35:00] He was fighting for his father's legacy. The father, who never thought much of him.
[35:05] He was trying to save his sister's life.
[35:12] He couldn't stop apologizing to me.
[35:18] Because he loves me, thats why. But oh well..
[35:25] I've left him.
[35:30] I finished everything.
[35:40] Oh my God.. what is my daughter involved with?
[35:55] You were my love yesterday. You are my love today and you'll always be so.
[36:03] But I love my family as well. I cannot be divided in two.
[36:15] Farhad? The food is very yummy. Come, lets eat.
[36:33] Here..
[36:49] How long will you sit like this for?
[36:58] I'm done Jojo.
[37:03] Farhad? Nothing's wrong. We'll be strong. Nothing happened.
[37:34] Channoo.. you have to drink this turmeric milk before you sleep.
[37:43] Come on get up. We're not sleeping. 
[37:46] We will see a doctor in the morning.
[37:50] You're not well since the past few days. Your eyes don't look better. Come on drink this milk.
[38:00] Chanoo?
[38:16] Chanoo? Come on. Get up. There is so much to do.
[38:23] Come on. We have to buy a gift for Bushra's daughter.
[38:29] You have to finalize a proposal for PK. We have to buy new curtains Channo.
[38:41] Chanoo, I had to die in your arms.
[39:26] She left. She left me alone.
