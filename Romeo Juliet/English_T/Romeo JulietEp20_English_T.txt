[00:13] I don't want to discuss Fareeha 
[00:15] there is no comparison between you & her
you are different & she is different.
[00:21]  Its a joyous occasion & I don't want to hear anything nuisance
[00:25] No, I didn't mean that.. 
[00:27] dad, I go to the office at 8 am in the morning & leave at 6 pm
[00:31] I have so many responsibilities of my house on me
[00:33]  I thought to help you during this time
[00:36] but I think I made a mistake 
[00:38] you were searching 
No no...
[00:41]  you were searching, right?
[00:47] you & your father thinks that I am thief they consider me a thief?
[01:30] I miss Fareeha a lot
[01:34] the life has become so boring since she had left the house, I don't enjoy at home
[01:39] hmm..
[01:43] shall we call her?
[01:45] yes, lets call her
[01:46] lock the door
[02:18] Billu... Zara!
[02:20] hi Fareeha!
[02:22] hi!
[02:25] how are you guys? It seems so good to see you both, I am feeling so happy
[02:29] even we miss you a lot, the house has become so desolate since you have left
[02:35] how are you?
[02:36] I am also fine
[02:37] Billu, my brother... how are you man?
[02:40] I am fine but sister, I miss you a lot
[02:45] even I miss you both a lot
[02:48] I miss all of you so much
[02:50] there is no liveliness in this house without you
[02:56] how's mom & dad?
[02:57] they are fine
[03:00] and aunt Shaggo?
[03:02] she is way too fine
[03:04] what do you mean?
[03:05] there is a news for you
[03:07] what?
[03:08] aunt Shaggo is getting married
[03:11] what!
[03:12] I mean when? and how?
[03:15] that Hamid uncle from the park, he proposed her
[03:21] so aunt Shaggo agreed?
[03:23] she agreed but you know everyone was after her
[03:28] everyone is the love's enemy here
[03:32] so how come this miracle happened? How come everyone agreed?
[03:35] uncle handled everything, like always
[03:41] dad is so nice
[03:45] but Fareeha, how will this marriage happen without you?
[03:52] what is the status of everyone's anger over there?
[03:55] what do you think? Will I be able to come?
[03:59] I don't know, Fareeha
[04:00] but we can plan something, as everyone is quite emotional during such time
[04:05] maybe anyone's heart shall melt down
[04:08] then do plan something
[04:12] I want to see all of you
[04:14] hmm... lets do something.
[04:15] By the way sister Fareeha, tell me. Don't you get bored over there? As you used to have a lot of preys over here
[04:24] not at all, I've found some here as well. Don't worry!
[04:26] I don't think so that they'll be fine then
[04:30] and I've learnt how to cook, in fact I am cooking see
[04:34] you've learn cooking. You! 
How come this had happened?
[04:38] the situation teaches you everything
[04:44] ok listen, shall I call aunt Shaggo?
[04:50] I think somebody is here, we'll talk to you later. Ok, bye!
[04:54] listen...
[05:56] Yaqoob, listen.. .
[06:05] what?
[06:07] what happened?
[06:11] I can't breathe...
[06:15] I just cannot breathe
[06:18] oh Shamim, for God sake..
[06:21] offer some prayers & go back to sleep
[06:24] but Yaqoob
[06:28] it feels as if there is so much of weight on my chest
[06:32] don't know what not you feel on yourself
[06:37] go & do some walk in the fresh air. Everything will be fine
[06:41] don't spoil my sleep, go away
[06:54] go quietly, and don't make noise
[07:26] you are still awake?
[07:32] are you fine?
[07:35] I can't breathe
[07:38] I can't breathe...
[07:40] come here, please sit
[07:42] come here, come on sit down
[07:47] take deep breaths
[07:49] take deep breaths, come on
[07:53] deep breaths
[07:58] shall we go to the doctor?
[08:00] I will get better
[08:05] lets walk for some time, this way you'll get some fresh air
[08:11] let me bring water for you
[08:25] here...
[08:33] are you better now?
[08:41] aunt, what's the matter?
[08:47] I am missing Farhad
[08:49] the liveliness of our house...
[08:52] whenever I used to get sick or feel anxious
[08:57] he used to sit with me for an entire night
[09:02] and make me feel better, he used to make me laugh
[09:07] so I am here
[09:09] I will sit with you for an entire night
[09:13] I am missing my son a lot
[09:17] Jojo...
[09:19] will you take me to him? I want to meet him
[09:23] Jojo... I am missing him
[09:27] ok fine, we'll go tomorrow
[09:33] will you take me?
[09:36] don't tell anyone at home
[09:40] Yaqoob shouldn't get to know
[09:43] he won't get to know
[09:45] am I crazy to tell him? Nobody will get to know, don't take tension
[09:51] if God wills we'll go to meet Farhad tomorrow
[09:58] leave everything and look at this
[10:00] check this video, how good it is. Look, what they are doing
[10:05] what are these people doing?
[10:08] weird things..
[10:18] its funny, right?
[10:39] what's the matter?
[10:41] why aren't you eating?
[10:44] just like that, I am not hungry
[10:50] Fareeha, I've been noticing since yesterday that you are so quiet
[10:54] is everything fine?
[10:57] I am missing my family a lot
[11:01] after talking to Zara & Bilal, I've become a bit upset
[11:20] at least your family misses you
[11:24] but my family has completely forgotten me
[11:34] I am thinking to call aunt Shaggo
[11:37] Umm...
[11:39] Fareeha
[11:41] don't you think, if she wanted to invite you on the wedding then she would have called you herself?
[11:49] I mean, I think this way. Maybe I am wrong but..
[11:55] I think, there can be more problems if you go there
[12:06] Fareeha
[12:08] it is better for us to stay away from that world
[12:22] I am getting late for office
[12:24] I am leaving
[12:27] and please eat something
[12:30] bye!
bye..
[13:00] yes Kiran?
[13:02] listen, I am going to Farhad's house to meet him
[13:06] Jojo is taking me, will you come along with me?
[13:10] No mom, I won't be able to come today
[13:14] please come along, your brother will be happy to see you and..
[13:19] I will also get some courage
[13:22] mom, actually a few guests are coming to Shahzain's house
[13:26] I have some work at home
[13:28] I won't be able to come with you, I will make another plan some other time
[13:34] give my love to Farhad, mom
[13:37] I will talk to you later
[13:40] Ok dear
[13:41] bye!
[13:43] I will convey him, bye!
[15:31] this is Energy drink's pitch, right?
[15:34] did the boss gave you to make it?
[15:37] No, boss had asked me to fix only 2 slides but..
[15:41] I checked the rest of the pitch & its way too bad
[15:44] so what did you do?
[15:47] I made a new option & sent it
[15:50] you've sent it as well?
What are you doing, man?
[15:53] Sir Jibran's team take care of the presentation
[15:57] why are you annoying them? You are picking enmity with them for no reason
[16:01] I am also doing my work
[16:04] if they will like my pitch, they'll use it
[16:06] and you think that they'll make you sit at the pitch meeting?
[16:10] yes, why not?
[16:12] Sir Jibran's team will also sit in the meeting
[16:15] why aren't you getting my point?
[16:18] Greetings sir!
Greetings!
[16:19] Greetings sir!
Greetings! sit down
[16:23] I have asked you to prepare 2 slides
[16:26] what is this?
[16:28] Sir, actually I have noticed a few weaknesses in the presentation and..
[16:34] I have put my input, if you don't find it right then you shall not use it
[16:39] did you took Jibran in the loop?
[16:42] No sir
[16:45] you are new here
[16:47] its not the right thing to bypass your seniors
[16:50] sorry sir
[16:53] but I like the initiative
[16:56] Good luck!
[16:58] thank you, sir
[17:01] but obviously, we'll use Jibran for the pitch
[17:06] Ok?
[17:10] its ok...
[17:14] no problem
[17:24] Fareeha
[17:26] Greetings!*
[17:28] we had gone to talk to aunt Channo upon your suggestion
[17:32] what did she said?
[17:34] we are getting 2 hours of extra water now. One hour in the morning & one hour in the evening
[17:37] isn't this good?
[17:39] No... absolutely not!
[17:42] it will be good once our house will get the water supply for 24 hours like her house
[17:47] who gets water for 24 hours?
[17:49] ok fine, if not 24 hours but at least she gets for 12 hours. Which is way too much than our house
[17:54] I think, none of us shall sit in peace until we don't remove this discrimination
[17:59] now look at the building's condition, its so dirty
[18:03] is it so difficult to keep a janitor here or to keep the dustbins?
[18:07] and have you noticed this mice issues?
[18:09] its just like putting a band aid, but the disease is as it is
[18:14] I don't understand what does Miss President do for us?
[18:21] aunt Channo is here
[18:22] aunt Channo
[18:25] we get water for 2 hours, but for how many hours you get the water?
[18:29] we should also get the water for same time
[18:31] who will get the cleaning done?
[18:34] there shall be some arrangements for the mice
[18:36] hey hey..
[18:38] what is this happening? Let it be
[18:49] its all her doing, her mistake
[18:51] No, its not her mistake
[18:54] its my own decision, mom
[18:56] and what do you think? If I will go back with you today then dad will forgive me?
[19:01] or will he give me a hug?
[19:03] I don't remember how does it feel to hug your father
[19:43] what happened, bro?
[19:50] they are using my pitch
[19:55] so?
[19:56] so!
[19:57] when sir Zeeshan had said that sir Jibran & his team's pitch will be used
[20:01] then why are they using my pitch?
[20:03] each & every slide is mine, and nobody asked me to come in
[20:09] how much experience you have got?
they won't let you sit in front of the client directly
[20:13] why they cannot make me sit? If I have done good work, then they shall give its credit too
[20:19] Sir Zeeshan & sir Jibran's team will take the entire credit
[20:24] do you think its fair?
[20:26] life is not fair, bro
[20:35] I will talk to sir Zeeshan
[20:38] have you gone mad?
[20:42] wait... no Farhad
[21:02] its good, now sell it
[21:06] aunt Shaggo
[21:09] we want to discuss something with you
[21:12] what is it? Is everything fine?
[21:17] if you have learnt a bit of Gujrati from me then you wouldn't be making such faces
[21:21] ashamed of you!
[21:25] aunt... 
speak up
[21:28] we were thinking to invite Fareeha in your wedding
[21:33] Fareeha?
[21:38] we thought its a good chance
[21:41] as of yet, brother Yousuf doesn't want to listen to her name
[21:46] then think about something aunt, how is this possible that Fareeha shall not attend your wedding
[21:54] even I want to invite her
[21:59] then please talk to them, just try once
[22:03] you guys will get me killed
[22:07] Okay, let me try
[22:10] lets think something
[22:21] Farhad
[22:23] yes
[22:25] you came early today?
[22:27] yes
[22:29] how many times I have told you not to make mess in the room in this manner
[22:33] just now I've seen that wet towel, and its stinking
[22:38] sorry
[22:41] what happened?
[22:47] Nothing
[22:49] office issues
[22:51] which issues?
[22:57] my manager...
[22:59] he is such an ill-mannered guy
[23:03] first he appreciated my presentation
[23:06] then he used my presentation & took me out of it
[23:09] also he didn't gave me any credit
[23:11] not even a single person in our office knows that I had made that presentation
[23:18] well...
[23:20] you are a new employee there
[23:23] it will take some time to make your place, ok?
[23:29] I don't know
[23:32] I don't think so that this job is right for me
[23:36] we don't have any other option as well, Farhad
[23:39] give it some time, we have to compromise a bit then everything gets well
[23:47] Fareeha, I don't think so that I will get a chance to grow in this company
[23:54] Ok fine, see...
[23:57] you can switch if you find some better opportunity
[24:01] meanwhile compromise a bit
[24:04] Ok?
[24:07] would you like to drink tea? Let me make it
[24:09] No, you sit let me go & make it
[24:11] you have cooked the food in the morning as well, so let me go & make tea now
[24:34] whoever wants to come shall come, and whoever doesn't want to shall not come
[24:36] now I won't be going to everyone & request them
[24:39] brother Yousuf, I want to talk to you about something
[24:44] yes, tell me dear
[24:50] its good that all of you are present here
[24:53] I want to talk to you
[24:54] is everything alright, that everyone wants to talk today. Tell me, what is it?
[25:00] We cannot attend this wedding
[25:04] what do you mean?
[25:07] do I have to explain it?
[25:10] we have been defamed in the entire community, almost more than half of the guests have refused to come to the wedding
[25:15] dear, whether anyone comes or not. Why shall we care?
[25:18] But the entire family is with Shaggo, ok?
[25:23] only you are with aunt Shaggo & with Fareeha, dad
[25:27] the way we are getting insulted in this family, you don't care about it
[25:32] and when there is no importance of our words & respect. Then what's the big deal if we attend this wedding or not
[25:38] don't fight because of me
[25:41] Saqib...
one minute...
[25:45] I am not asking you but telling you, got it?
[25:52] its your hand in bringing our family on this verge, dad
[25:57] you don't care about respect at all
[25:59] but I do care about my honor & reputation
[26:03] I have to save myself for the sake of my family's future
[26:33] try to keep down your phone sometimes, Farhad
[26:39] you are not at home the entire day, and as soon as you come back you get stick to it
[26:43] give me some time as well
[26:45] so I am sitting with you
[26:48] but your attention is not on me
[26:51] Fareeha, I am trying to relax for sometime after doing the entire day's hard work. What's wrong?
[26:57] hmm... so you get relaxed by this?
[27:00] please check who is there
[27:09] who is it?
[27:21] mom!
[27:28] my child... 
[27:38] mom... 
[27:43] Greetings aunty!
[27:54] how are you?
[27:56] I am fine mom, how are you?
[27:59] I am not fine
[28:05] I am not happy
[28:08] it seems as if I am a living corpse
[28:09] at least don't say this
[28:14] I was thinking that you are upset with me
[28:17] you didn't come to meet me
[28:19] also you didn't call me
[28:21] don't you know your dad? Ask him
[28:24] how I came to meet you today
[28:32] just keep coming to meet me
[28:35] ok?
[28:38] I won't be able to come again & again
[28:42] and yes, I am upset with you
[28:45] who does this?
[28:48] you've turned away your face from your mother
[28:50] didn't you miss me even once?
[28:54] I couldn't sleep
[28:56] what else I could have done, mom?
[28:58] everything was infront of you
[29:03] nobody had the courage to take stand for me in front of dad
[29:08] I didn't had any shelter, but dad didn't gave me some place in his house
[29:16] neither there is any place for me in dad's house, mom
[29:19] nor in his heart
[29:23] you are the son of that house
[29:26] your place is there
[29:29] only yours
[29:33] forget her by considering it a mistake, and come back
[29:42] lets go
[29:49] what are you saying, mom?
[29:53] she is my wife
[29:58] is this how marriages happen?
[30:00] this is some joke, not a marriage
[30:05] what do you want? Let me beg you to come back
[30:08] your mother is begging in front of you. Come back to us
[30:16] ask her, what does she think
[30:19] she will be able to live happily after ruining a mom's family?
[30:26] aunt, what are you saying?
[30:28] I am saying the right thing
[30:31] its all her doing, her mistake
[30:34] No, its not her mistake
[30:36] its my own decision, mom
[30:39] and what do you think? If I will go back with you today then dad will forgive me?
[30:43] or will he give me a hug?
[30:46] I don't remember how does it feel to hug your father
[30:49] maybe he might have hugged me on some Eid or so & that too because he is giving a hug to everyone in the line
[30:54] so he had to hug me as well forcefully
[30:56] he doesn't want a son but an animal who shall say "yes" on his every command
[30:59] Farhad!
[31:00] you know I am saying the right thing
[31:08]  tell me honestly
[31:10] had father talked to politely ever?
[31:13] or can you speak anything in front of him?
[31:17] did he talk to you politely?
[31:19] I've been observing it since I was so small. You used to get panic attacks as soon as dad used to enter the house
[31:24] you shiver badly
[31:26] but does anyone have the courage to speak in front of dad?
[31:29] He did whatever he wanted to. But what is my son doing?
[31:33] What are you doing?
How are you talking to me?
[31:39] You've left your mom, you were my only support there
[31:44] mom, leave that house
[31:47] come to me
[32:02] the matter is not only of Fareeha, mom
[32:07] maybe I have got the courage to leave that house because of Fareeha
[32:13] but the truth is that house was never mine
[32:17] neither its people
[32:25] I cannot go back, mom
[32:28] and if you have come to take me back home
[32:32] and that too without Fareeha
[32:38] so please go back
[32:59] aunt, we are getting calls from home
[33:01] we should leave now
[33:05] lets go Jojo
[33:08] I came to bring back my son
[33:13] but my son is not here
[33:23] lets go
[33:28] the mother whom you are rejecting
[33:32] Your paradise lies under her feet
[33:38] remember this!
[33:40] lets go, Jojo
[33:48] can't you talk to your mom politely?
[33:50] Jojo, lets go!
[33:53] lets go
[34:20] what wrong Saqib is saying?
[34:22] now you don't start, stop it!
[34:27] do you know what is your problem?
[34:28] I don't know, but you will tell me
[34:33] you worry about everyone in this house, except for your own son
[34:37] what rubbish your are talking?
[34:38] I am saying absolutely correct thing
[34:40] he is your only son
[34:44] he has to handle everything in the future
[34:46] but you never took any suggestion from him in the business or in house related matters
[34:51] so he will react obviously
[34:53] sometimes I get so worried because of Saqib's thinking
[34:58] and I've started to get worried because of your thinking sometimes
[35:02] what not we had faced because of Shaggo & Fareeha?
[35:07] Saqib has never annoyed you
[35:12] but don't know why do you consider him as your enemy
[35:17] I am telling you Mr. Yousuf
[35:20] if our son leaves this house because of your stubbornness
[35:26] then I will never forgive you
[35:28] never!
[35:29] but.. 
[35:32] what problem is this?
[35:36] she never understands anything
[35:39] oh... 
[36:11] Farhad, come.. the breakfast is ready
[36:20] come, have breakfast
[36:22] No I am not hungry
[36:24] at least have some
[36:26] No Fareeha, today I will do it in the office
[36:30] are you okay?
[36:36] whatever happened with your mom yesterday, I know it must be very upsetting for you
[36:43] I am sorry that because of me.. 
[36:46] Fareeha, I had said to you yesterday as well
[36:49] that its not your mistake
[36:57] don't know why I had felt for a few seconds that mom had started to give importance to my decisions
[37:05] but no
[37:07] she only wants her son back at home
[37:12] no matter even if I get divorced
[37:15] show me
[37:18] she is your mother, Farhad
she must be missing you
[37:26] I cannot pay such a hefty cost for it, Fareeha
[37:33] anyways.. 
[37:34] leave this topic
[37:37] I don't want to think about the past
[37:40] but I only want to think about our future
[37:46] I am getting late for office, so I am leaving
[37:49] shall I pack your lunch?
[37:50] No, thank you!
[38:21] hello!
[38:24] Greetings!
[38:26] Greetings! Are you Ms. Dangerous husband?
[38:32] yes... Fareeha
[38:34] yes yes, I am the the husband of that bad-tempered woman
[38:39] we couldn't meet properly
[38:42] actually the matter is that we have to be really cautious in the fight of these women. Specially you & me
[38:49] we have to act tactfully, got it?
[38:52] yes
[38:53] Okay, the actual matter in my mind is that what I forgot to tell you. Actually my mind doesn't work when my tea gets cold
[38:58] day after tomorrow is a religious festival
[39:01] and on that day, we decorate our entire building every year
[39:05] we enjoy a lot, the kids play with the firecrackers
[39:10] we pray for the entire night, also there are various eatables too
