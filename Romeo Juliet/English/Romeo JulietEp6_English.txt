Mom, I'll not spare her so easily.
So will you wear her around your neck like an amulet?
Let her go to hell. I'll find a new girl for you.
No. Mom..
Its not about getting married. She has made me stubborn.
I'll not let those two siblings get off so easily.
And as far as Kiran is concerned,
if I don't bring her to your feet, don't call me Shahzain.
You're just dragging matters.
See, someone else is teaching her. She won't listen to you now.
Mom, you don't know.
Sympathy is magic.
And whoever is teaching her, I'll knock sense into them as well.
See, I don't think you'll get something. Isn't it better you work hard for something else?
What are you saying?
You're spoiling my entire game.
Now that I'm near my destination, you want me to go back.
God knows what she told you. She's asking for a divorce and you don't understand?
What do you want? Do you want to get your parents insulted?
Nobody will insult you mom. Just keep watching.
I'll now have to use other tactics.
Don't get your hands broken, while using your tactics.
Alright. Don't worry now. I have to go out for some work, I'll talk to you when I get back.
This boy will never understand.
Hello mom.
Hello. Farhad, where were you? You're so late today.
I was working mom.
I'm coming from the catering. Tell me how are you?
Are you okay?
Everything is okay.
Did you eat?
I did.
Did you take your medicine?
I did.
Listen.. Shahzain came.
What?
Why did he come here?
Did you let him meet Kiran?
He came unannounced. Kiran opened the door..
He was apologizing. He even touched my feet.
He's regretting.
Mom, all this is a drama. He isn't regretting anything.
You know what he's regretting? That he lost the catering business.
No Farhad..
I felt he was telling the truth.
What?
See, dear..
However Shahzain is, he is Kiran's husband.
We don't have divorces in our family.
Your father isn't alive as well. How will Kiran live without her husband?
Mom.. She might live without her husband
but if she lives with him, she might not survive.
God forbid..
See mom.. you'll have to decide now. Do you want a divorced daughter or a dead daughter?
Let me ask you something, mom.
If you had a brother and he supported you..
And he would have told you that you wouldn't live with that person, would you have stayed with dad?
What nonsense are you talking about your dead father?
I'm just saying..
The support you didn't have then.. Kiran has now.
Mom time and circumstances have changed.
The courage you didn't have then, women today have it.
Kiran has it as well.
She cannot say it because whenever she talks to you, you tell her to be patient.
At all costs, this house is better than her husband's house.
My sister isn't a burden on me, mom..
Dad?
Why is she here?
Hello brother Saqib.
Mom and dad gave me the good news and I couldn't hold back so I came.
Really?
Say that when he turned you down, you came back to us.
She is so selfish.
Whats wrong with you?
Can you not cool down?
Why is she here?
I'm just here to congratulate everyone.
See, Ramsha and I don't even want your shadow to touch our child. Understand?
Whats wrong Saqib? What are you saying?
I accept that she made a mistake but this doesn't mean we'll treat her like this.
She is our daughter and she can come a hundred times.
Tell me directly that no matter how many mistakes she makes, she'll always be your favorite.
And I'll never be your favorite even if I do everything good.
What are you thinking? Your misinterpreting whatever we're saying.
Dad..
brother Saqib is right. I shouldn't have come here.
May you always be happy, brother Saqib. I came to give this gift.
Accept it if you can.
Fariha, stop. Fariha?
Fariha? Are you happy now?
Oh my God!
Is this a circus going on here?
They are called food bloggers.
We give them money, they come to us, eat the food, make video and upload.
People watch those videos and then come to us.
Wow. First we pay them to eat. What is this?
This will earn us a loss.
There will be no loss. This is marketing. Put it in the marketing budget.
Farhad? Is this marketing?
Isn't marketing the age old technique of printing pamphlets and distributing everywhere.
Time has changed, Munshi..
Farhad, you're talking about spending money.
And, he's saying that we don't have money.
Please keep faith.
The dessert will be as sweet as the amount of sugar we put in.
What are they doing here?
Welcome to Karim Baksh and Caterers. I'm your friend Jojo and this is my friend, Mr. Farhad.
Hello.
You'll find the best biryani, nihari, korma, karhai, hot flat breads and many more.
If you eat once, you'll come back for more. This will become your favorite place. I promise.
I'll make you meet my team. This is brother Shamshad.
Shamshad.. say something.
I don't speak much. I cook and make people eat.
Wow. Amazing Shamshad.. He has magic in his hands.
Like our page and follow it to stay updated.
Come here and try the food. You'll love it.
This is me, your friend Jojo, signing out from Karim Baksh Caterers, bye.
This is very wrong, Shabbo.
Brother Yousuf should have talked to Saqib first and then take Fariha home.
Whats the problem?
If brother Yousuf had taken Fariha back..
Saqib didn't have to make such a big mess. It was unnecessary.
But Fariha gave them the opportunity to do all this.
Don't advocate for Saqib.
I'm not advocating for anyone, aunt.
I'm just saying that whatever happened, nobody was at fault.
If nobody is at fault,
then why is Fariha, paying alone for all this?
Is it because, she,
was forced by her heart and did all this.
Even though Fariha's heart forced her to do all this,
but see that brother Saqib is forced by his own rules.
You two should stop arguing.
There should be some margin given to blood relations.
You're right.
But we will need time to mend this gap.
Shaboo, did you call Fariha and ask her if she's back home. Where is she?
Yes. I tried her phone.
But she doesn't tell me anything. She said she'd go home in a while.
So she must be thinking you don't know what happened and made an excuse.
Should I call?
No
Don't call her again and get her worried.
She might want to be alone for a while.
Maybe she'll return when she feels better.
Yes. She needs to understand this matter with a calm mind.
If she makes a bad decision this time, she'll be in a loss.
Hello?
Hello Kiran? Why aren't you taking my calls?
Why? What is there to talk about?
How many times should I apologize?
Do you want me to fall to your feet and apologize, I'll do that.
But why are you doing all this?
Really?
Am I doing everything?
Its about me, Shahzain..
Whatever you did with me..
Its not easy.
I know Kiran. I know. I made a big mistake. I did wrong with you.
Kiran.. I listened to mom..
And I couldn't handle the pressure of marriage.
I know I wronged you. I'm the worst.
And I was late to care for you.
See Kiran, whatever it is. We're married and its not a joke.
We should work on it. I'll work on myself. Just give me a chance. One chance.
No. I don't have the courage Shahzain.
I'll be your courage Kiran. I'm with you.
But its my turn now. I'll fix everything. Give me one chance, Kiran.
I know Kiran, some bad moments have made our good moments go fade.
But think yourself Kiran.. we were not always like this.
Everything can go back to how it was. Give me one chance Kiran.
I'll make you very happy.
Kiran, if you don't forgive me,
I'll finish myself.
No. No Shahzain. No.. Shazain..
Get a grip on yourself. Don't like this.
I won't. I don't want to live this life.
If you don't forgive me, how will I forgive myself. So isn't it better if I finish myself
Shahzain! No.
Relax. Okay? Get back to your senses. No.
So then tell me you'll not talk about the divorce. You'll give me another chance?
Please Kiran.. You can at least do this much for me. To save our relationship.
Just give me one chance Kiran.
I'll think about it. Let me think. I'll tell you then, Shahzain..
Thank you Kiran. Thank you so much. I love you. I really love you.
I'll talk to you later. Relax..
Farhad, you're amazing.
Its all of our hard work.
Thats true.
It gets difficult to bring back customers if they leave once.
And they didn't.
What do you mean?
They are all new customers. The old ones aren't back.
Customer is a customer. What is new and old?
As it is, we're not looking back. We're looking ahead.
Old customers are loyal. A new customer comes to try out a new thing for a while,
But then they leave once they're done.  What if..
No Shamshad..
These old customers were also new customers once. 
We'll work hard on them. Don't worry.
Alright. I'll go and lock the kitchen.
1500.. 30, 830.. How much altogether?
Please come in. What do you want?
We're not here to listen to anybody. Listen to us. Leave this shop with respect.
Do you understand? If we come back again, we'll not give you a chance. Instead we'll drive you out ourselves.
How..
Quiet. You'll empty this shop. That's it.
Move your hand. Be careful.
We need this shop empty tomorrow. Not a single person should be here or else we won't spare anything.
Understood?!
Fariha? Fariha?
What happened Shaboo aunty?
Brother Yousuf is in the hospital.
What? Why?
There were some people at the shop. They hit him. He's injured.
Oh God. Lets go.
There's an injury on the head and he has lost a lot of blood.
 His condition is critical.
Everything will be alright. 
Brother Yousuf is very tough. These cowards cannot harm him.
Don't worry.
I just hope he gets better.
But.. I don't understand why did this happen and how?
Bad luck had to renter our lives.
Saqib how did this happen?
 Brother Yousuf has a full security system in his shop.
There is CCTV and there's a guard as well. 
How could everybody come in while all of these were there?
And nobody saw anything. How is this possible?
I don't understand.
How could someone dare?
You should go and check the footage at brother Yousuf's shop.
I'll keep giving you updates here. 
And whoever did this with brother Yousuf, I'll not spare them.
Who are you calling again and again?
Fareeha's missed call.
So why did you miss it?
I didn't know she'd call.
Put up custom ring tone on her number. Loud and rowdy. 
In fact, have an alarm system.
If she calls, a red light shines bright.
You'll give me out of the world options. What should we do now?
What can we do? Try again.
I think she dialed by mistake. 
She isn't answering.
Mom's calling. 
Yes mom?
I'm coming. Yes.
I have to take her to a therapist.
Did aunt agree?
For now, yes. Lets see.
God have mercy on the doctor.
I'll leave now.
Keep an eye on your phone.
You'll have to arrange blood from the blood bank. He has lost a lot of blood.
Alright. I'll go and see.
Your hospital doesn't have blood?
His blood group is O negative and its not available in the hospital right now.
Thank you. I'll go and check.
Hurry up.
Hello. We have an appointment for Mrs. Shamim Baksh.
I'll check.
Yes. Where is the patient?
She's in the waiting area.
Alright. Ask her to wait. I'll call her.
Okay. Thank you.
Shaboo.. where are they? Its very late.
They're here.
What happened, Hamid?
Rashida.. we've been told about a place. I'm going there.
Saqib, how are you?
Hello?
Did you send people to my dad's shop?
So this means he has agreed.
He's in the hospital in critical condition
I told them they just had to scare him.
I think it was too much.
Have you lost your mind?
I told him, we were trying to make him understand with love or else..
Who does this with family? You're memons. From our community and you're doing this?!
Saqib, we just have temporary bonds in business. Work is work. 
Now understand what we're trying to tell you. This was just a trailer.
We have had three four surgeries for O negative. We don't have the blood available. 
The family is worried.
We have been telling them that we need O negative blood in excess but they don't hear us.
The patients have been suffering and we get abuses hurled at us.
Isn't it a little hot in here?
Drink this cold water.
Doctor, I need to tell you that I'm here because my son insisted.
I don't have any psychiatric illness.
Didn't you want to come here yourself?
What will I do? Coming here? 
Should I tell you all my family secrets? You're a stranger.
This is wrong.
Excuse me, madam.
Yes?
I'm O negative.
Will you donate blood?
Yes. Why not? If my blood donation can save someone's life, why not.
Alright. Come fast.
Mam.. will it hurt?
So, is there anyone in your family or friends whom you can share your heart with?
My kids.. They've grown up. They're sensible and..
as it is, once married, we don't have friends. Homes,
housewives..
Did you have friends before you got married?
A lot of them and I was an extrovert.
We would go to the markets everyday. Eat Gol Gappas and visit fairs.
So why did you stop meeting them after you got married?
Such things don't suit a married woman.
My husband didn't like it.
He used to say that going out, calling friends home or meeting them,
it was equivalent to wasting time. He said it was best to focus on family and home.
He was right.
So, what do you like?
I mean.. what makes you happy? Your kids?
Or maybe something else. It should be related to you.
Its been years.
I never thought about my happiness. As it is once we're married,
women don't think about their happiness. 
They think about their family.
Its a right of every human being to be happy.
Our society locks up women in boxes. Mothers, daughters, wives, daughter in laws..
They lose themselves. 
We make them believe that if she values herself first, she'll be selfish.
But its not the case. When a woman is happy herself. When she thinks about her life first, 
only then she'll be able to give something to someone else.
I valued my family 100%. I gave everything to them. Love and respect.
And I never showed them or told them what was in my mind.
Of course. That is why you're here today.
The pain you have hidden, is still fresh. 
They have become unhealed wounds and they're hurting you.
Nothing changes in a day. You should be happy that you came here.
People think if we hide our pain in front of the world, it means we're strong.
 But its not true. In fact, its the opposite.
It is important to express and share your emotions. That is the real strength.
A person should handle his emotions, his anger, his frustration, his anxieties.
When you learn to manage everything, you'll understand what else is there in the world. 
And how you can be happy.
You haven't eaten anything since morning. Your blood pressure will fall down.
Shaboo I'm not hungry. I don't want anything.
But how can this work? You have to be strong.
What will happen to us? 
I'm going to get you something to eat and I won't hear a word.
I wanted to tell you that we've arranged blood
Really?
Thank God. Are they back?
No. We found a doner in the hospital.
God sent an angel for you.
Can I meet him? I want to thank him.
Please come. I'll take you.
Are you afraid of the needle?
No. Not the needle. 
The blood makes me anxious.
Relax and get some rest.
He's there.
He donated the blood?
Yes. You can meet him if you want.
Nobody should know who donated blood. 
Write it on the file and the information will stay confidential.
Don't you want to meet him? Do you know him?
Its our personal matter.
Just understand that my family and this boy shouldn't know anything.
