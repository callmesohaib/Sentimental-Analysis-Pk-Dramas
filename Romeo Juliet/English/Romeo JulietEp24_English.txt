Take out your phone. I'll tell Maqbool that there will be no wedding ceremony today.
dad don't do this. The police will bail them out.
If the police hands over our daughter to us, what respect will we have left?
You are punishing me in your fight with Farhad.
Tell me, think about it calmly.
Is it something that you are willing to compromise our relationship over?
Move away
oh Yaqoob, not this pot
Look what I'll do to him.
You'll bust his head wide open!
Thank God that you're back.
Come on.
My wife.
Freeha.
Greetings*
Let me offer some charity in your name.
I'll be right back.
Greetings*
Greetings*
Farhad, so this is the one!
Yes uncle.
She is beautiful.
You'll get a good thrashing today.
I told you not to come here.
How dare you step foot inside my house?
Uncle, this is her first time here.
I told you not to show your face here.
I'll beat you two black and blue.
He's right, this is the first time she's here. You kept talking about respect...
Was she your lover? Where's your respect now?
You've buried it!
I will show no respect anymore.
Father, I had no other way.
So you made her run away from home?
For a second did you think what me, your mother and sister would go through?
And you?
Did you think about your parents?
A girl who doesn't respect her parents, how can she respect my home?
How did you bring her here?
I invited them here.
You might like any girl for your sons.
I don't! Don't speak in my matters!
Go son.
Play this little game of yours.
If she couldn't be loyal to her parents, then can she be loyal to anyone else?
Do you have a place to live?
Do you have a job? What will you feed her? What will you clothe her with?
You can't take care of yourself and you've brought her here.
Will you make him wander from place to place?
Will you find peace then?
Leave it uncle.
He likes seeing his children in pain.
The doors of this house were closed on me and now you have an excuse to oust me from this house.
Silence Farhad.
Why should I?
Say whatever you want about me, I've been hearing it since I was a child.
But I won't tolerate a word against her.
Get out of here then!
Silence!
In your eyes I was never anything and maybe I'll never be able to become anything.
But I'll become a good husband and father.
Why are you standing here?
Begone!
It's okay... he's angry right now. He'll get better after some time.
I don't know why it occurred to me that he would restrain himself in front of you. But no!
I was wrong thinking he could change.
Tell me what we have to do next.
Brother Isa is coming to pick me up.
I'll take a look at a few houses.
I'll arrange a place by tomorrow.
I'll come along as well.
Where will I take you?
I want to get rid of this as soon as possible.
To get out of here.
Freeha...
I don't need anyone else.
I'll take care of everything
Brother Esa is here, I'll be back soon.
Bye*
Greetings*
You can go.
Isn't brother Yaqub not coming today as well?
You should get used to seeing me now brother Shamshad.
Brother Shahzain you didn't give me the deposit slip last time. I needed to file it.
I have fifty other things to do.
On top of that I have to take care of this catering business.
Everything is digital nowadays, why are you bothering me with slips?
You know brother Yaqub doesn't bother with these things.
There must be some record in the bank.
Find it there, where should I look for the slip now?
No... I didn't say that. I need to pass it over the accountant.
I understand! I'll talk to him.
Why are these tables so dirty?
Is there anyone here who works, or are they all lazy?
You can do your work properly and you're worried about the accountant's work.
Have these tables cleaned, I'll check them when I come back.
Mother...
Greetings mother....
Greetings to you too.
The tea is made, I'll be right there with it.
Should I help?
Sit down.
Mother, I wanted to talk to you about something.
About Shahzain.
Mother... mother.
Mother, is everything alright?
I'm tired. Your father is putting me through a difficult test...
I only have one son and he wants me to forget about him.
He's asking me to think that he's dead.
Why would I think he's dead?
He's done what he did. Forgive him.
Talk to your father, he'll listen to you.
He's angry right now, he won't listen to anyone.
Mother...
Call Shahzain, he respects him.
He'll make him understand. Ask him to talk to your father.
Shahzain?
Yes..
Mother... Shahzain is against these things. It will make matter worst.
He loves you... he listens to you. You can convince Shahzain.
You left as well... Farhad relied on you.
I can't talk to anyone here. I feel suffocated.
I want to end myself.
Mother...
if you lose strength right now, then what will happen to us?
Listen to me carefully...
Leave everything to time. I promise you that Farhad will walk through those doors.
He will... don't lose strength.
No... don't say such things...
I'm right here with you.
Farhad will be here as well. Leave everything to time.
Leave it to time.
Get up and run!
What happened? Is there a fire or something?
Empty the room, the police is here.
Why?
Don't act so innocent and empty the room.
Come with us!
What happened?
be quiet, else I will slap you so hard
but what happened? My husband is coming. I've called him, leave me!
madam listen to me I've called my husband, he's coming here.
why are you dragging me? Why aren't you listening to me?
You won't be able to show your face to anyone after I'm done with you.
He's my husband...
Shut up!
She's been speaking for ages. I'll hit you with this stick, so be quiet!
Fariya!
They brought some guys from a hotel here, there has been a misunderstanding.
Farhad... Farhad.
I'm here, don't worry. Everything will be alright.
They forced me to come here.
Why is it locked!Hurry up she's my wife.
Let us speak outside.
So what if she's your wife? Where did you come from?
If you're so concerned, then why did you leave her at such a sleazy place?
It seems the blood in your veins is hot and thick!
It seems like you've eaten a lot of protein.
Who are you to go berserk in a police station?
I'll file so many cases on you that you won't be able to go home.
There has been a misunderstanding, she's my wife, we were married yesterday.
Why did you choose such a place after getting married?
I didn't know... I was looking for a new place.
I was in a hurry and that's the only place I could find.
You want me to believe this?
Sir I can testify.
You are with him, why should I believe you? You'll go inside with him.
I have the marriage certificate as well.
If you do, then bring it here!
It's in the hotel.
I'll bring it sir.
Sir, the marriage certification will be here soon, please take her out.
Go and sit down.
Are you going to tell me what to do?
I can't ignore the fact of the place where we find you from.
Stay in the police station for the night. We'll deal with this in the morning.
Do you understand what you need to say when I call you?
What kind of man are you? Why don't you understand one thing!
The marriage certificate won't do anything, I know how these people are.
On top of that I have him here.
He thinks that he's a film hero. He held the police officer by the scruff of his neck.
Do as you say. Don't be late.
Hang up and be ready.
Here is the marriage certificate sir.
That was quick.
How can I believe that this is real?
What are you saying sir?
The place where we found you from...
I can't ignore that fact.
Stay in the police station for the night. We'll deal with this in the morning.
I've been saying it for ages that she's my wife!
My brother-in-law is an SP. He wants to talk to you.
What should I do?
He wants to talk to you. Talk to him.
What is this? Have you gone insane?
Here you go.
Hello.
Is this SHO Moheez?
It is.
Who are you?
This is SP Jamshed Akram.
I'm sure you've heard of me.
Yes sir.
Yes. This is my brother-in-law and his friend.
They are good kids and they are not who you think they are.
Don't bother them. I'm talking to their families to make things better.
The girls is from an honorable family.
It's a family from Chinoy. I'm sure you've heard of them.
Ofcourse, the ones from Askari?
Yes, the very same.
But...
her name isn't mentioned here.
That's because it's from her mother's side.
Sir, how can we leave them?
Do you need a protocol? You already have the marriage certificate.
Can't you do this simple task?
Do you want me, an SP, to come to the police station in the middle of the night?
If you can't do then let me know I'll talk to the IG.
No sir, if he's your  family, then he's my family.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
No... let's meet.
No sir...
I'll take care of it.
No, let me come.
No sir, I'll take care of it. They are like my family kids.
I'll take care of it.
Alright.
You should have told me before.
I don't like showing off.
I thought that the marriage certificate would be enough.
But you...
You guy are from a humble family.
These minor fights happen at home.
Family is family after all. Just be careful.
Alright? You guys can go. Let them go!
Thank you... thank you very much brother Isa.
I wonder what would have happened if you weren't here.
You're like my little brother, just keep a cool head.
Both of you acted very well.
We didn't act, we were just lucky. Otherwise he didn't gave good intentions.
Take care of her. Let me know if something happens.
Take care.
Thank you
Shall we go Fariya?
Fariya? Shall we?
Fariya, what happened?
What happened.
I was in lockup.
Do you have any idea how scared I was?
Did you see the people they took me away with?
Or did you not see?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I want to go home.
I want to go to my father. Take me home.
I'm tired and I want to go home.
Fariya, no one would help us at this time.
My father will.
Father loves me. He's a little upset right now. He might shout at us...
but he won't leave me like this. I know...
Fariya, give me some time.
I have my eyes on a few places. We'll shift in a few days.
What will we do in a few days? Live in a similar hotel?
Farhad, I want to go home. Please take me there.
Please take me home today.
Relax.
We can't go right now.
I'll take you in the morning.
What will we do now?
There is one place.
We'll stay here for the night.
We'll leave before anyone arrives in the morning, to your father's home.
We're safe here. Don't worry. Alright?
Do you know...
whenever mother and father used to fight.
Father used to come here to sleep.
Sometimes I used to run away from home and come here.
Did you think about running away from home?
I never thought of doing so.
You're up?
Eat something, then we'll leave.
Tea?
Fariya...
Are you sure you want to go to your home?
Do you remember the last time I went to your place, 
they shoved me out of there?
I don't expect anything less this time as well.
Rather, I expect to get insulted.
My father's heart will melt after he looks at me
What if he asks you to stay?
Only you?
Will you stay without me?
It's not like that. My father... is not like your father.
Fariya...
Whatever happened these last few days... I don't want you losing hope.
I told you it's not like that. Father will help us.
Let's go. I'll go and change.
Fariya...
What happened to her?
She's here with that guy.
What?
Mother...
Silence!
Not one more word. 
What are you here for?
This is my home. I came to my home.
You left this home.
This home isn't yours.
But whatever happened was my compulsion.
Compulsion?
You were compelled?
You are the one who compelled us to be helpless.
Do you have any idea what we had endured because of what you did?
Look at my brother's state?
What happened to father?
Don't you dare step a foot forward. You can't meet him.
Don't you dare touch my wife!
I will kill you.
We have married.
Father, you too...
I don't want...
this girl's dirty blood on my floor. No one's life will be ruined by her!
I'm sorry... I know I hurt you but...
But... but... but...
All you wanted was to impose your will.
You are all grown up!
Our decisions are becoming a burden on you. 
Well you took them off... so why are you here?
Did you think that you would come here cry and apologize and I would embrace you?
You killed everything and everyone!
And...
Everyone used to tell me not to give you much freedom, 
but I didn't listen to anyone.
I trusted you more than I trusted myself and what did you do?
For him... you left us all.
You did all of this for love, right?
Now stand by it... 
you didn't need us when you were getting married, then why are you here now?
Spend the rest of your life with him.
 The doors of this house are closed on your forever!
All of you are so unlucky!
You are turning away a person like Fariya.
You've lost your daughter.
You heard what father said, right?
Now get out... and don't you dare come back again.
Go... go!
