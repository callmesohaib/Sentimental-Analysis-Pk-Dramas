Shamshad we got less work done than last month.
Hmm. People came for brother Yaqoob's name.
Who is here to run the business now?
A lot of our old clients have started taking orders from Biryani House.
Hello.
Hello. Please sit down.
What happened? Why do you seem worried?
What happened?
Actually, we have less orders now. No biryani orders at all.
I was afraid of this.
You people are experienced. You've been with dad since the beginning. Please tell me what to do.
We're also thinking what should be done.
Shamshad.. Shahzain sat here for a while. Lets call him here as well.
He asked me if we needed any help.
What happened? Why has Shahzain's name silenced you?
Shamshad..
Actually, Shahzain is Mr. Yaqoob's son in law. You're his son.
It is our duty to tell you.
What do you have to tell me?
See I've always been loyal to brother Yaqoob.
That's why I'm telling you.
Actually when Shahzain was here, a lot of accounts were misled.
What?
Did dad knew about it?
Yes. He had his doubts.
But he often used to say that he might have made a mistake in the calculations.
He never expressed his doubts but..
But?
But?
I am not in a position to say this.
I am sorry to tell you this but actually..
I think Shahzain doesn't have good intentions.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Come inside. I'm sorry I was chopping vegetables.
The bell rang suddenly so I panicked. Sit
Its alright if things get panicked.
But people shouldn't have a problem.
What do you mean?
Leave what I mean..
There shouldn't be a problem between you and Farhad..
Sister in law.. I don't know whether you and Farhad have fought about something..
But I do know that he cannot live without you.
Did he send you here?
No. He doesn't even know I'm here. I wanted to talk to you.
It doesn't seem so Jojo. You're always running away from me.
See, I'll come straight to the point.
I have never heard or seen the Romeo Juliet love story. I don't even understand it.
But these Romeo and Juliet of Burns Road.. they're very close to my heart. I'm a fan.
So I can't let it end tragically and if I have to interfere for it, I will.
Thank you for worrying for us.
Where is that idiot?
He's a hard working boy. He must be at his catering house.
Lets go and see how this hard working lad works. Will you take me there?
Sure.
I'll just keep this and come. We'll go then.
Sir, have you had your food?
Yes.
Was everything okay?
Yes.
Sir, bill?
Sir, you ate here. You'll have to pay the bill.
He's the SHO.. leave him..
Bring him here.. Bring him..
Sir..
Farhad?
Where is Farhad?
He..
The police took him.
Who?
Farhad..
Why?
He asked for the bill from the police officer and a fight ensued.
Do you know which police station they took him to?
The one near the market. The policemen must be from there.
I'll go and see..
No. I'll come with you too.
Can I come along too?
You stay here.
Sir, my brother, Farhad.. Kareem Baksh Pakwan, did you bring him here?
So his supporters are here as well?
Sir, please let him go.
Sir he made a mistake.
Not a small but a big mistake. He showed a lot of attitude.
Now let him live in the police station for a while. It will knock sense into him.
Sir..
Sir see.. he's a kid. He doesn't know how things work here.
We apologize for whatever he said.
Things have gone beyond an apology now. If you want him out..
Tell me what you can give.
What do you mean?
Sir, please order..
Now we're talking.
It will cost around 2-300,000.. What is this Jojo? This is unfair..
Things will go wrong. Let me talk. Sir, his father passed away recently.
And our catering house isn't doing well. It'll be difficult to arrange such a big sum.
Please be mindful.
See, your business has been running for ages. Have we ever asked for money earlier?
Mr. Yaqoob had a great setting. He only took very little extortion money. Now you'll have to pay up.
Sir, what are you saying..
Get the money and take your friend.
Alright. We'll arrange the money until tomorrow morning. Can we meet Farhad now?
Bring the money tomorrow and meet him then. Get lost now.
I told you, you'd get the money by tomorrow.
What do you think? I'll break the prison and take him away or will you hear and deliver my message? Should I?
Ladies get emotional. We can understand.
Of course.
What are you doing here? You could have sent Jojo or Shamshad with the bail money.
Jojo is here.
Look at them. They didn't pay the bill first and when I asked for it, they shut me behind bars.
Farhad, you're new in the catering business but you're not a new born.
Don't you know what the police does?
Why did you have to argue with them?
I cannot tolerate something wrong. You know it very well.
You cannot tolerate a lot of things these days, Farhad.
But can you still not see where your anger has brought you.
How far will you go?
You were always the one with the rules. You loved when I fought for others.
What happened now?
Farhad, there is time to pick a fight.
You have to stop and pause at times to think how will your decisions affect others.
We're not kids who roam around on bikes. We're married.
And your wife is standing in front of an ill mannered policeman for you bail. Do you even care?
So you shouldn't have come here.
You're right. I shouldn't have come here.
Your bail will not be granted before tomorrow morning.
What?
Tomorrow morning?
And I think its right. Spend a night here and think who you're fighting.
The one you should be fighting for.. our relationship.. you're trying to end it yourself, Farhad.
Please...
I'm in no mood to hear your lectures.
Alright. Stay here and enjoy!
I'm sorry. I asked you the money in an emergency. I know it won't be easy to arrange it immediately.
Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much.
My friend has bothered you a lot.
Jojo, do you know what? Your friend needs anger management.
I'm scared now.
It seems he's on a mission to destroy himself.
Why is he entangled in a self destructive behavior? First he fought in his office and now this..
I'll make him understand but first let him come out.
Alright. I've arranged for the money. We'll get it in the morning.
Yes I too have talked about it.
I pray to God something happens.
Jojo its okay. Its not your responsibility. Don't worry. I've arranged. Please drop me home now.
Alright. Lets go.
Kiran?
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Come down. Give me your hand. Come down.
Who told you to do all this?
I cannot see you in pain. I really feel painful.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happens to me when I'm angry. I don't understand anything. I lose myself.
Forgive me please. You know I'm not a bad man.
A person only gets really angry on the person he loves the most.
I love you..
Please forgive me.
Oh.. where are you going? I'm being so romantic and you're leaving?
I was going to cook. Mom will be upset.
You don't have to. I'll talk to mom. The kitchen chores will be done.
And I'll do all this organizing of the wardrobe. You don't worry.
Lets do one thing. You get some rest.
Then we'll go for dinner.
Dinner?
Yes.
I want to talk to you today.
Talk about what?
About our future. What we have to do in the future?
How will we move ahead?
And if we have children tomorrow, what sort of a life will we give them.
Its good to see you smile after so many days.
But why are you quiet? I'm the only one speaking continuously. You say something too.
I don't understand what to say.
Please stay the same Shahzain..
Just the same..
It depends upon you, my life.
Come on.. get ready and then we'll go. I'll go freshen up.
Are you alright?
Hmm..
Waiter?
My wife is the guest of honor today. You'll bring whatever she says.
Tell me what do you want?
Anything..
How can it be anything? Look at it and tell me what do you want.
Should we have Chinese or desi? In fact, we have desi every now and then. We have a catering house.
I think we'll order Chinese. I'll see. Okay..
One fried rice with chicken chowmein and..
this black pepper manchurian. I think its enough. Please hurry up. We're hungry.
Isn't it a good place?
Yes.
You do know how much I love you?
See, I cannot see you in pain.
But everything happens because of you. I'm your husband.
And I do whatever I do for our future.
Shaboo..
This.. finish this teenage beauty tantrums. What do you have against food?
You haven't eaten or talked to me since morning.
There's a problem.. You want me to dance around the house?
I didn't say that.. You don't have to dance but you can laugh and talk to me.
You tell me.. after what happened in the morning, is there something to laugh and talk about?
Shaboo.. you know everything and yet you're acting as if you don't know anything. Its neither yours nor their mistake.
No Ahmed. Its all my fault. It was my fault in Saqib's matters and,
And its my fault in Farhad's problems as well.
You're mistaken Shaboo. Its not the case.
Did you see how Farhad talked to me?
He was misbehaving. He didn't even bother that you were there.
I saw and heard everything.
Even I didn't like how he talked and I'm upset. He should have shown some cordiality.
But Shaboo.. I think we should give some margin to Farhad. He has become very sensitive about things.
And the sympathy you showed him, he's looking at it in an incorrect manner.
What does being sentimental mean?
Isn't he looking at his own attitude. He misbehaves with us.
He misbehaves with Fariha. God forgive us but their natures are poles apart.
Our Fariha isn't like this.
Shaboo, you're right but we don't have to be emotional about it. We have to be sensible.
Ahmed.. I'm feeling anxious. What if..
something bad happens?
Nothing will happen Shaboo.. Do one thing, have your tea.
Your mind is heated up like tea. Drink it and relax. Cool down. As it is, Shaboo..
You are elder than the two of you. You'll have to do something. They're young.
They don't look at life like us. They'll need time to understand things.
And we're here to forgo everything.
By the way, this tea is good. Did you make it or did Basharat?
I made it for you with my own hands.
Why didn't Basharat make it?
I told him a couplet and he left.
He didn't even compliment you?
Isn't Fariha here?
No..
Why would she come? She could only taunt me.
I was in the prison all night. Did she even bother?
What would she do coming here?
Would she do charity for you? You're coming back from prison. Not a battle.
Should she welcome you with open arms? If I could, I'd have brought a necklace made of slippers for you.
I'd have knocked some sense into you.
What nonsense is this?
Do you even realize how worried she is? She's all alone. She left everything for you.
But you didn't even think about it once. How would she have managed to arrange 300,000 for your bail?
300,000?
Yes. I heard her talking to someone for the money.
Who was she talking to?
I don't know. Someone from the family, maybe.
Now her family knows that I was in jail all night. She knows very well I wouldn't want a favor from her family.
So you take a favor from me as well.
Jojo its different about you.
Whats different about me? You're not doing good with yourself or with her either.
Think about it. Where could she have arranged 300,000 in a night? She would have had to ask. She had to manage something.
We'll give it back to them. Right now focus on your sinking catering house. Come now.
When did you come, Farhad?
Sorry, I came back in a night. You wanted me to spend a couple of nights.
I thought you'd be back with some regrets.
There are a lot of regrets, Fariha..  
You have them..
What do you mean, Farhad?
Fariha, I'll ask you once and answer me truthfully. Did you take money from your family for my bail?
Farhad..
Did you take money from your family for my bail or not?
It would have been better if I had stayed in jail.
What nonsense is this? What is this attitude?
You talk about your self respect. 
Tell me. When we came in this house, didn't you ask Jojo for money for the rent and groceries?
Jojo is different.
Didn't your ego come in between then?
Jojo is different..
You weren't a hypocrite then!
Jojo is different!
I didn't ask anyone for a favor Farhad!
That was my fixed deposit money. I told you earlier but do you even listen to me?
You told me to save that money, we'd need it in difficult times. 
I didn't know that difficult time would be to get you out of jail.
Yes. I'm a loser. You also tell me. I've spoiled your life. You're regretting marrying me.
Farhad, you don't have to talk on my behalf. I'm tired of hearing this. You're insecure yourself.
Yes I am insecure. I am a hypocrite. I'm useless. 
I beg people for money because I cannot earn myself. Is there anything else left to say?
Can you talk like a mature adult?
Yes. I'm immature as well. Tell me more..
You're really very immature Farhad. That's it.
Do you even realize what I'm going through?
My father is dead. 
And I'm trying my best to take care of everything since then but nobody bothers.
Neither my family, nor this world. And not even you. 
I'm fighting a new battle outside, everyday.
The problems, the arguments that I've never let touch you.
And all this so that you can tell me how insecure and immature I am? I'm tired.
I'm tired of my life. 
But this isn't important. What is important is that I left my dirty towel here!
And Fariha, you said, you'd throw it. Why didn't you?
Why didn't you throw it? I'll throw it. And these dirty clothes. I'll throw them too
Stop it Farhad!
Farhad please..
I don't want to talk!
Dear? Dear....
So what have you thought about your grandchild's name?
Let the day arrive and we'll think of a name as well.
As God wills. Ever since Shabboo found out, she has brought all the wool yarns out. She's knitting sweaters.
She's making tiny booties.
Shaboo is an expert with all this. She made these for all of our children.
Yes of course.
Brother, I was young then.
You're still the same.
How time flies. We don't even realize. Children grow up but we never stop worrying.
Its alright. When he becomes a father, he'll understand me.
Then we'll see.
Let it be. Focus on the happy occasion.
Yes of course.
I'll see..
Fariha? What happened to you?
What happened?
What happened to you? Fariha? What happened dear?
What happened my dear? Tell me what happened?
Come and sit here..
What happened? Dear? Tell me..
Fari, how did this happen? Who did this? Tell me my child..
He must have done it. Whats his name? Farhad! I'll not spare him. I'll draw his blood.
How dare he raise his hand on my daughter?
Fariha, you should have come back with us that day.
She's bleeding.
Don't worry dear. Your father is alive.
Yes. Lets go home with us. You don't have to go there.
Take Fariha inside. Clean the wound. I'll call the doctor. She needs rest.
Go dear.
Lets go.
Oh my God.. I won't spare him.
I'll not spare him.
Brother Yousuf, relax. We'll see what we should do.
Oh God...
 I'll be back in a minute.
