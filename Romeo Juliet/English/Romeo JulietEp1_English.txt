We had been together for 3 decades. We saw the world changing. 
We saw time changing.
But one thing, that even time couldn't change.
It was the love Channo and I had.
Not that we didn't fight. We argued everyday.
But Channo and I didn't let our story reach the end.
We didn't let our love reach the end.
When we're young, we have a lot of passion. 
We feel our relationship will end on even the smallest arguments. Like everything will end.
But some people have God's hands over them. 
He keeps their hearts and souls attached to each other.
No matter how much we destroy ourselves, how much we argue, but,
when God blesses us, everything is alright. Love blossoms once again.
She used to make a lot of noise but she left and I didn't even know.
The pain of love is very important. 
This allows our pain and happiness to become one.
Channo took away all my pain and gave me her happiness like this.
Like this..
Channo gave me her life and her love. 
The rest of my life will now be spent with her memories.
If my God can give me just one more day with Channo, I can bear a thousand similar pains.
Both of us are weird.
Yes.
We did everything in a chaos. 
We fell in love but didn't make our families accept it and set out on our journey.
But this time we'll do everything right.
I have told my family that if they're not happy with our relationship, I'll call it off.
There's no rush. 
If I have to spend my entire life to get your family's consent, I will.
I'll fall in their feet and do as they say, but,
I cannot live without you Fareeha.
 I don't want a Romeo Juliet love story. 
I want an ordinary life.
With you. 
I don't want any romance.
I want love, Fareeha.
I don't want to run anymore. I want to settle down.
Only with you.
Do you know I've started therapy for anger management?
Huh?
I took my mom but I realized that I needed it more for myself.
Didn't you realize it a little too soon?
Fareeha I have complete fate we can spend a beautiful life. 
We have God on our side.
We're soul mates.
Thank you.
Does it still hurt? 
He wounded you bad.
Thank God, you got rid of him. But there is something, thats,
not letting me sleep at night.
What do you think?
Does he have no accountability? 
He can do anything he wants. He's sitting comfortably without any regrets.
I'm scared what if he does the same thing with someone else, the things he did to you.
What can we do?
We can file a case against him.
Mom, do you even realize what you're saying? Such cases are not easy.
I have not filed any FIR against his abuse. You know people will ask uncountable questions.
Was I sleeping? Why do I remember now? Did I just wake up?
Life won't be easy, mom. 
It'll become a mess.
If only we can find a good lawyer and proofs.
This case is difficult but not impossible. We can win.
Any old doctor's reports? Anything?
I do have a proof.
What?
I have a video. I was sitting in my room and doing something.
He entered all of a sudden and started hitting me. My hand touched the camera and the video was recorded.
I have that video. I have it.
Then we can file a case and win it.
Yes. Yes.
If only I had seen these wounds earlier.
 You used to come all the time.
Your eyes told your story but I just didn't want to listen to it.
Its alright.
Oh you son of a king? We have five containers to mix. Who'll do it?
There is a secret to everyone's success and this is our secret.
Don't mix them here. Its a secret. 
Until we put in our share in our work, we don't get anything in return.
Come on stand up and I'll tell you how its done. Good boy.
Put your hands here. Pull it towards yourself and shake it. Again. Be careful.
Enough. Again. Shake it again.
Yes. Just be careful.
Biryani is a thing on its own but the real deal is the mixing of the container.
You're only taught this with your mother's prayers and a good mentor.
 If there's even a small mistake, the fresh rice, like your bright face,
will wilt down..
Farhad, this is so good.
Really?
Farhad, I'm telling you the truth. I've never eaten such good Biryani ever.
Fareeha. Dad taught everybody everything here. He just didn't teach them one step.
And it was the mixing of the Biryani. 
I used to tell him it won't make a difference but now I've realized.
Every single step is important
I feel I'm eating Biryani made my brother Yaqoob, for the first time after he passed away.
Don't worry Shamshad. We have our old taste back. 
We'll have our old customers back as well.
I'm so happy for you. I've never seen you this confident ever.
If you're with me. We can achieve anything.
We just need mom and dad's approval.
We'll do it.
Will you meet dad today?
Whenever you say.
I think lets meet dad alone first. Lets make him agree
 because if he does, everybody else will.
Alright. He'll be alone on the shop today. Lets go today.
As you say.
Listen, you've made me taste biryani but I've heard the korma is good too. Make me taste that.
Yes, the korma is good too. Ashraf, bring a plate.
Why just a plate? Get me a flatbread too.
Yes. Ashraf, get a flatbread along too.
I was thinking. Get me a dessert as well since you're ordering so much.
Of course. Ashraf, get a korma, flatbread and rice pudding too.
Just one? Aren't you eating?
I will not share my rice pudding. I'm telling you. Get your own.
Ashraf, get korma, flat bread and.. 
in fact bring everything that's in the kitchen.
They'll think I eat too much. You eat this. I'll wait for korma.
No. We have a full pot inside. You eat.
Is dad there?
Brother Yousuf isn't here yet.
Dad's not here?
What are the two of you doing here?
We're here to talk, brother Saqib.
See, I don't want to hear anything. Go away. Why did you bring him here?
We're just here to talk.
Brother Saqib. Please listen to me once.
Get out.
I want to talk to you.
See, don't create a scene here. Go.
Get lost.
Don't worry Fareeha. Nothing will happen to Farhad.
Be strong.
How did this happen?
Farhad took the bullet meant for me.
Bottalwala's goon shot at me and Farhad came in front.
Dad..
If something happens to Farhad, what will I do?
No..
Nothing will happen. God will save him.
I was holding him by the collar a while ago.
And the next moment, he took the bullet meant for me and fell down
Oh God..
Please God keep all my children save.
What did I do? I made a big mistake.
What happened?
What happened mom? Mom?
I hid something from you people.
What is it?
When your dad was hospitalized and needed blood. 
It was Farhad who donated his blood for your dad.
What are you saying? Why did you hide this from me?
I was very selfish.
I made a mistake because I saw my family becoming one, once again. Please forgive me.
Oh my God. I made a big mistake to understand the child. All of us made a mistake.
Your father has blood in his body and your brother is breathing because of a man who doesn't belong to our community.
Oh God.. please forgive me. Forgive me.
I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake.
Oh God.. I made a mistake.
Everything will be alright. Don't worry.
Don't worry. God will make everything alright. I'm praying just like you are.
When God will hear two mothers praying together, He'll definitely hear us.
Why have you guys created a crowd here? 
The patient can only have his family members here. 
Please the rest of you can leave.
Until we get any news from inside, nobody will leave.
Let the doctor come and we'll leave. See..
Everybody is my family.
But sir..
And nobody will leave until they get a good news about Farhad..
But sir.. it isn't allowed.
Enough..
Your patient is conscious now.
The operation is successful. You can meet him now.
Oh..
Farhad.. I'm here with you.
Thank God..
Fareeha.. Everybody is here. Am I dead?
Coming. Who is it now?
What happened sir?
Are you Shahzain?
Yes sir but I think you're mistaken.
Mistaken.. you fool!
We're here to take you. Come along.
But sir, whats my fault? I'm a respectable man.
You hit a woman and call yourself respectable?
Come along.
Wait a minute. Listen to me. Sir, I didn't do anything.
Sir, somebody is taking revenge against me. Sir, I'm a respectable man.
I didn't do anything. I'm telling the truth. Brother?
Brother.. I didn't do anything. I swear.
We need a double plate of biryani. Two khausay and four hot flat breads.
Hurry up with the orders.
Isn't it a little too crowded today?
Ever since you came, the business has doubled. 
Everybody loves the new menu. You should have come earlier.
Shamshad? Put the butter on the flat bread, not Kiran.
No brother Farhad..
Brother, I had been telling this since day one. She is farsighted.
I've never been proud.
Don't be extra. Have you seen the time?
 You're always late. 
Do you want to be late for your anniversary party? Its evening.
Is the food ready?
Yes. Absolutely ready.
Lets just pick up the food and leave.
Hurry up. Wait.. Stop at a place.
Its almost done..
Come on, Jojo. Don't be so angry. Its not good for health.
I'll tell you about meditation to relax. 
You have to breathe in from your stomach. 
Not from your chest. Thats why you get angry.
Uncle, what happened? You haven't blown the other balloons yet. There are so many left.
I've blown in all the air I had.
Hello? Isn't it done yet?
I can't open the tape.
You'll only be able to see the tape if you move your hair.
I don't have curls like you.
It looks very yummy but isn't it a bit too small?
Its because of you people, we're infamous.
Such a small cake?
I thought we're such a sweet family. We'll manage.
The spread is beautiful. 
I feel our food brings us all together. It doesn't divide us.
You're absolutely right. Now since our stomachs have become one, our hearts will become one soon.
Of course. Where are our Romeo and Juliet?
Yes, where are they?
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
You're the sweetness in my life.
Promise?
Promise.
Want some?
Here..
Fareeha?
Alright. Okay.
Fareeha..
Come get it if you can.
