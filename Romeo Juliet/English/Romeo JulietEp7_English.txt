Mother you have depression.
There is no shame in accepting this fact.
If you had accepted this before...
then you might have gotten the help you needed earlier.
What more do you want than her broken arm?
A woman has to tolerate.
You will not understand that.
Please let him come inside.
I want to talk to him as well.
You said that you could handle her
What happened?
We lost our golden sparrow. You couldn't even get a car out of her.
What will we do if we lose the catering business?
Why are you standing there idly? Tell us, what should we do?
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.
She will not go anywhere.
She will come to me.
Auntie...
I didn't even think of divorce.
I just asked for time to solve our problems.
Time to think what we want from each other.
I thought that he would have missed me all this time we were away...
Is this what he thought of?
Is it so easy to end a relationship which we fought against the world to have?
Is he that weak?
It's not for everyone to maintain relationships.
This is all the strength that he had.
No auntie.
We are not the ones who lose strength.
This cannot be how this ends.
Time...
is cruel.
It shifts the life in an instance.
When a storm passes...
then things don't stay the same...
and people don't stay the same.
You have to be strong to take these decisions...
I knew that this would happen.
When I explained it to them, they thought that I was their enemy.
My parents didn't listen to me, nor did my sister.
Let them do as they please.
Why are you cursing yourself?
She chose to do what she did and she should now deal with it.
The guy is ruining my sister's life.
Your sister died for you when she ran away to marry him.
You are right.
She died the day she ran away from home.
Then stop blaming yourself. She is responsible for what she did.
One more thing, before Fariha's divorce begins, I want you to talk to father again.
I don't our future to be compromised because of this divorce.
I'll talk to him.
This time there will be no talk...
You will decide, because I don't want anymore delays...
What do you want me to do? Should I sell this house?
You're acting like a kid.
I am not! I'm telling you the truth.
And if you don't do this now, I'll go to my brother's.
Why do you always bring that up?
Everything is in front of you but still you bring this up.
I am trying...
I've heard enough, now is the time to act.
What hell is this!
Farhad... come in.
It's time for your medicine.
The doctors said that you need to have it ever six hours.
Here you go...
Come on...
Here.
Here you are... it has turmeric in it... drink it...
Good...
You need to have this soup as well.
Thank you.
For giving me strength.
You never liked Shah-zain.
It was I who wanted him.
Shah-zain...
Look at me today.
All of us our helpless at the moment.
What did you do? Jojo told me.
Why didn't you apologize to Fariha? I'm sure you could have convinced mother.
It's not about mother.
It's my problem.
I am not worthy of her forgiveness.
Hey...
Listen to me carefully...
You're not father.
And you will not become like father.
Don't punish yourself for them.
Your life is incomplete without Fariha.
But hers is complete without me.
Come on!
Shut up and have this apple.
Rest up, we'll talk later.
You need to take the next dose after six hours...
Hey... sorry..
Sorry I was late. How's your mother feeling now?
Mother is well now, she's home now.
Really...
Thank God... what did the doctors say? Is everything alright?
One tends to have more than one illness at her age.
Yes, that's true.
I have my fair share of problems as well.
Sorry you had to sit in the sun because of me.
It's like I'm destined to stand in line... first it's the hospital...
sometime it's work...
Why are you saying that?
I'll have a key made and I'll give it to you..
So that you can enter when I'm not around.
No... there is no need for that.
I'll wait... I don't want this responsibility.
It's just a key, I'm not asking you to clean up inside.
Women have rights...
You will not stand in the sun.. I'll give you this key.
As you wish.
Did you have breakfast?
You didn't have breakfast before coming to the gym?
Let's have breakfast first...
Alright.
You've taken a great decision.
Once you talk to him he'll convince you.
He talks in a weird way but... he's here.
Greetings*
I'm well.. how are you?
Sir... life can't be spent being well all the time.
To live life one needs money!
Yes... you're right.
The thing is that we have bought all the shops in the market, yours is the only one that is left.
A bulldozer doesn't know that this shop belongs to you.
When you've bought the entire market...
then why do you need mine?
We will demolish all these shops here and then we'll make a shopping mall.
You are my memon brother that's why I'm talking to you respectfully, otherwise...
Really.... otherwise how would have talked to me?
Brother Yousuf there are many ways, but it would be better if you don't find out about them.
Alright fine, I'll think about it and revert to you.
My ears are tired listening to this. Why did you call me here?
I thought that I would be coming here to sign a deal. You wasted my time.
Why did you invite me here then?
You will have to empty the shop. I'll show you.
What did you do father?
He was giving us a great offer... what do you want?
Did you hear how he was talking? He was talking like a gangster.
Should I give him my shop?
He's from our brotherhood.
There can bad people in our brotherhood.
You're not understanding father, once we sell our shop to him...
it doesn't matter who has our land. We can buy a new shop with that money.
I know everything, understand?
It's plain and simple father, he will take this shop away from us..
We're getting good money for it. We'll gain nothing by fighting him.
I understand now... greed...
makes one a coward. One forget their values.
He sells them too
I'm going to pray... think about what I said.
Forgive me Kiran...
Please listen to me one more time...
Who is it?
Mother...
Mother... forgive me...
Forgive me... I don't know how I do this?
I regret it later, forgive me.
Get up son...
No... hit me...
What I did to your daughter was wrong.
I have sinned... please hit me.
Kiran... ever since you left home I haven't eaten properly.
I can't sleep... I can't work... please don't leave me.
Please make her understand... I'll change myself for you.
I promise... I will change myself for you.
Whenever I'll get angry, I distance myself from you.
I will not say an harsh words. Just give me one more chance.
Kiran... only your love can change me.
If you don't forgive me... I will have no place to go.
Shah-zain...
Please get up...
and go.
Kiran.
You know how much I love you.
If you don't forgive me for the rest of my life...
then I'll ask for you forgiveness for the rest of my life, but I cannot leave you.
Please... forgive me just this once.
Shah-zain get up.
The people are watching... get up.
Kiran listen to what he's saying.
I know...
that you have a big heart.
And you will forgive me one day.
I'll wait for you.
When you think the time is right, return home.
How many people are there at your home?
At home...
I have an ill mother and two blind sisters.
And your father?
Father was a fisherman...
He drowned when I was a child.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I am not...
Father used to hit us when we were kids.
It's good he died, if he hadn't we would have drowned him today.
If you hadn't given me this job...
then I wonder what might have happened to my ill mother and two blind sisters.
Don't worry... everything will be alright.
Ever since you've come into my life...
everything has been going great.
What do you mean?
Madam... shall we start the session?
Yes... the girls are here... I'll start my class.
Alright?
Sure.
What did that girl had to come here right this instance!
Auntie may I come in?
Come in...
Are you going somewhere?
Yes... Khalid's friend has invited us to dinner.
We're going there...
Is this too much?
No... you look beautiful.
Are you still worried. Everything will be alright?
Yes... I came to tell you that I'm go outside for a while. I'll be back quickly.
Where are you going?
I was going home.
I don't whether I should call that place home or not.
How will you go there alone? Let me come with you.
No... it's okay. I'll go alone. Enjoy your dinner.
I'm grown up now... I can manage.
Go ahead... I'll be back early. Don't worry.
Everyone who comes to the gum reeks of sweat.
I've made a rule, no one will enter without apply a body spray.
You're the one who has taught me this.
I think brother Yousuf is the one who should talk about this.
Secondly, Fariha is a guest at her home.
As as host we shouldn't say such things. She is not a burden on us.
It would have been better if I had rotted in jail!
Why is everything so silent? Where's everyone?
I think it's the the effect I'm having.
Whatever I touch turns to ash.
You're always so sad, think about how we can reel in customers.
Don't you think I think about that? Should I force people to come here?
After father's death...
the customer's connection with the business has abruptly ended...
So... let's reconnect them.
Did you take feedback from the people who are sitting outside?
They are regular customers.
Will you wait for them to leave? When someone leaves my gym...
I call and ask them about what happened.
I ask them why they left?
Someone told me that the place reeks of sweat.
I've made a rule that anyone who comes to gym will have to apply body spray first.
You're the one who taught me this.
And now you've forgotten it.
Use your brain... and work hard. You'll get all of your answers.
Did you think of something?
Excuse me sir... is everything okay?
Is the taste okay?
What I mean to say is that do you have any complaints?
Meaning, everything is fine?
Sir, do you feel a change?
We want to understand why our customers have lessened.
Otherwise our business was always so busy at this hour.
yes
I don't know...
Sorry sir for disturbing you, please continue.
It's good but...
there is something missing.
What is that?
I don't know, but there is something missing.
I come to eat here daily. My shop is just around the corner.
I used to talk to Mr. Yaqub daily.
It's a force of habit to come here... maybe that's what everyone else is missing.
Sir... is it the spice that is less...
or you don't like the taste of the food.
There's nothing wrong... it's just I'm not feeling it...
How can we add feelings to the food?
What did your father do?
Fariha my dear...
Love is love.
It is a part of our soul.
Sometimes it get weak...
But it doesn't die... love never dies.
I've realized one thing... we cannot sacrifice our families again.
It's been a long time since my father hugged me...
I don't want to lose his love again.
What about Farhad?
Maybe what everyone says is right...
Love isn't enough for marriage...
Fariha...
I don't know what will happen to you and Farhat...
but I would like to tell you something. The bond that we have with you...
will never end.
You are like our daughter.
The doors to our home and hearts are always open to you.
You can come here anytime you want.
Thank you so much.
I'll get going.
Farewell.
Bless you my dear.
Sit down.
Are you okay?
I'm okay, how's everyone at home?
Everyone is fine.
Father...
I miss all of you.
Can I go back home with your guys?
I wanted to tell you some good news.
Saqib is about to become a father.
Really... I'm about to become an aunt?
I want to meet him.
I...
I know that brother Saqib is angry with me...
But I will ask for his forgiveness. Maybe he'll forgive me.
Yes...
You don't know...
but right now things are tense at home.
If you go there, Saqib will leave home.
Unfortunately...
fate has brought us to a place...
where we have to choose between our two children.
I understand.
This was caused by me, and it's my responsibility to fix it.
Please give me one more chance... I want to ask for his forgiveness.
Maybe I might have an effect.
Sure... we'll give you that chance.
Are you well?
You're so busy nowadays at the gym, we don't get the time to talk.
I'm bust too... I don't get the chance as well.
Mr. Jojo, we have to work...
Ever since you've come into my life, my day can't go on without seeing you.
You've become my support
I could never have divided the work load like you have.
I have a brother named Farhad, whatever I am today is because of him.
He supported me, like you're supporting me now.
You've never introduced me to your brother Farhad...
I wanted to... but he's quite off nowadays.
He did come once or twice, but you weren't available then.
I wanted to mention you, but he was going through some trouble...
I didn't think it was appropriate.
The way you praise him...
I can't wait to meet him.
He's an amazing guy, he'll become your favorite once you meet him.
I'll introduce you to him as soon as I get the chance.
If you don't mind, might I say something?
Why are you being so formal? Why would I mind?
What if we go out for dinner somewhere.
It's okay if you don't want to go... I made a mistake by saying it... I'm sorry.
Wait... I lost my handsfree...
I don't mind... let me know when you plan on going.
Oh...
I do have one condition... I will pay for the bill.
What do you mean?
It's settled then, that's the condition.
Here you are...
Wow... I thought that this would be enough for me.
Sit down.
Is Fariha not coming for dinner?
I went to get her...
She's refusing to come.
She said that she doesn't feel like it.
This way she'll get more weak.
I don't understand anything. What's going on?
We are being tested by God, don't worry, everything will be alright.
Fariha is not fine.
It seems that something is eating away inside of her.
Her eyes have lost their shine.
Shaggo, for Fariha this is not ordinary circumstances...
She is going through a tough period...
people even with the strongest will power...
break under circumstances. She is dealing with it patiently though.
I was thinking of talking that brother Yousuf...
should take Fariha home with her for a few days.
She would be happy there amongst people... over here...
she remains silent.
I don't think you should talk to brother Yousuf about this.
Why? Why shouldn't I?
Look... listen to me... the first thing is we don't know how Saqib sees this issue...
I think that brother Yousuf should talk about this...
The second thing is that Fariha is our guest
and as her host it's not appropriate for us to say such things.
Is she a burden on us?
Besides... Fariha...
is not an emotional position to understand anything.
What ever you tell her now she'll take the wrong meaning out of it and I don't want that to happen.
This is her home, as well as brother Yousuf's. 
She can live here as long as she wants.
Alright?
Sometimes I think what would happen...
if you weren't in my life...
Then you would have been eating cold food.
Alright fine...
I have some poetry?
The one that you recited on our wedding day?
You didn't like that one.
I have something new...
Sure go ahead...
A box inside a box and inside that box is a cake... you're laughing... I wont' continue...
What do you mean? What's inside that box?
A box inside a box and inside that box is a cake.
It's for kids but...
What?
And you are one in a million...
