I don't want to discuss Fareeha 
there is no comparison between you & her
you are different & she is different.
 Its a joyous occasion & I don't want to hear anything nuisance
No, I didn't mean that.. 
dad, I go to the office at 8 am in the morning & leave at 6 pm
I have so many responsibilities of my house on me
 I thought to help you during this time
but I think I made a mistake 
you were searching 
No no...
 you were searching, right?
you & your father thinks that I am thief they consider me a thief?
I miss Fareeha a lot
the life has become so boring since she had left the house, I don't enjoy at home
hmm..
shall we call her?
yes, lets call her
lock the door
Billu... Zara!
hi Fareeha!
hi!
how are you guys? It seems so good to see you both, I am feeling so happy
even we miss you a lot, the house has become so desolate since you have left
how are you?
I am also fine
Billu, my brother... how are you man?
I am fine but sister, I miss you a lot
even I miss you both a lot
I miss all of you so much
there is no liveliness in this house without you
how's mom & dad?
they are fine
and aunt Shaggo?
she is way too fine
what do you mean?
there is a news for you
what?
aunt Shaggo is getting married
what!
I mean when? and how?
that Hamid uncle from the park, he proposed her
so aunt Shaggo agreed?
she agreed but you know everyone was after her
everyone is the love's enemy here
so how come this miracle happened? How come everyone agreed?
uncle handled everything, like always
dad is so nice
but Fareeha, how will this marriage happen without you?
what is the status of everyone's anger over there?
what do you think? Will I be able to come?
I don't know, Fareeha
but we can plan something, as everyone is quite emotional during such time
maybe anyone's heart shall melt down
then do plan something
I want to see all of you
hmm... lets do something.
By the way sister Fareeha, tell me. Don't you get bored over there? As you used to have a lot of preys over here
not at all, I've found some here as well. Don't worry!
I don't think so that they'll be fine then
and I've learnt how to cook, in fact I am cooking see
you've learn cooking. You! 
How come this had happened?
the situation teaches you everything
ok listen, shall I call aunt Shaggo?
I think somebody is here, we'll talk to you later. Ok, bye!
listen...
Yaqoob, listen.. .
what?
what happened?
I can't breathe...
I just cannot breathe
oh Shamim, for God sake..
offer some prayers & go back to sleep
but Yaqoob
it feels as if there is so much of weight on my chest
don't know what not you feel on yourself
go & do some walk in the fresh air. Everything will be fine
don't spoil my sleep, go away
go quietly, and don't make noise
you are still awake?
are you fine?
I can't breathe
I can't breathe...
come here, please sit
come here, come on sit down
take deep breaths
take deep breaths, come on
deep breaths
shall we go to the doctor?
I will get better
lets walk for some time, this way you'll get some fresh air
let me bring water for you
here...
are you better now?
aunt, what's the matter?
I am missing Farhad
the liveliness of our house...
whenever I used to get sick or feel anxious
he used to sit with me for an entire night
and make me feel better, he used to make me laugh
so I am here
I will sit with you for an entire night
I am missing my son a lot
Jojo...
will you take me to him? I want to meet him
Jojo... I am missing him
ok fine, we'll go tomorrow
will you take me?
don't tell anyone at home
Yaqoob shouldn't get to know
he won't get to know
am I crazy to tell him? Nobody will get to know, don't take tension
if God wills we'll go to meet Farhad tomorrow
leave everything and look at this
check this video, how good it is. Look, what they are doing
what are these people doing?
weird things..
its funny, right?
what's the matter?
why aren't you eating?
just like that, I am not hungry
Fareeha, I've been noticing since yesterday that you are so quiet
is everything fine?
I am missing my family a lot
after talking to Zara & Bilal, I've become a bit upset
at least your family misses you
but my family has completely forgotten me
I am thinking to call aunt Shaggo
Umm...
Fareeha
don't you think, if she wanted to invite you on the wedding then she would have called you herself?
I mean, I think this way. Maybe I am wrong but..
I think, there can be more problems if you go there
Fareeha
it is better for us to stay away from that world
I am getting late for office
I am leaving
and please eat something
bye!
bye..
yes Kiran?
listen, I am going to Farhad's house to meet him
Jojo is taking me, will you come along with me?
No mom, I won't be able to come today
please come along, your brother will be happy to see you and..
I will also get some courage
mom, actually a few guests are coming to Shahzain's house
I have some work at home
I won't be able to come with you, I will make another plan some other time
give my love to Farhad, mom
I will talk to you later
Ok dear
bye!
I will convey him, bye!
this is Energy drink's pitch, right?
did the boss gave you to make it?
No, boss had asked me to fix only 2 slides but..
I checked the rest of the pitch & its way too bad
so what did you do?
I made a new option & sent it
you've sent it as well?
What are you doing, man?
Sir Jibran's team take care of the presentation
why are you annoying them? You are picking enmity with them for no reason
I am also doing my work
if they will like my pitch, they'll use it
and you think that they'll make you sit at the pitch meeting?
yes, why not?
Sir Jibran's team will also sit in the meeting
why aren't you getting my point?
Greetings sir!
Greetings!
Greetings sir!
Greetings! sit down
I have asked you to prepare 2 slides
what is this?
Sir, actually I have noticed a few weaknesses in the presentation and..
I have put my input, if you don't find it right then you shall not use it
did you took Jibran in the loop?
No sir
you are new here
its not the right thing to bypass your seniors
sorry sir
but I like the initiative
Good luck!
thank you, sir
but obviously, we'll use Jibran for the pitch
Ok?
its ok...
no problem
Fareeha
Greetings!*
we had gone to talk to aunt Channo upon your suggestion
what did she said?
we are getting 2 hours of extra water now. One hour in the morning & one hour in the evening
isn't this good?
No... absolutely not!
it will be good once our house will get the water supply for 24 hours like her house
who gets water for 24 hours?
ok fine, if not 24 hours but at least she gets for 12 hours. Which is way too much than our house
I think, none of us shall sit in peace until we don't remove this discrimination
now look at the building's condition, its so dirty
is it so difficult to keep a janitor here or to keep the dustbins?
and have you noticed this mice issues?
its just like putting a band aid, but the disease is as it is
I don't understand what does Miss President do for us?
aunt Channo is here
aunt Channo
we get water for 2 hours, but for how many hours you get the water?
we should also get the water for same time
who will get the cleaning done?
there shall be some arrangements for the mice
hey hey..
what is this happening? Let it be
its all her doing, her mistake
No, its not her mistake
its my own decision, mom
and what do you think? If I will go back with you today then dad will forgive me?
or will he give me a hug?
I don't remember how does it feel to hug your father
what happened, bro?
they are using my pitch
so?
so!
when sir Zeeshan had said that sir Jibran & his team's pitch will be used
then why are they using my pitch?
each & every slide is mine, and nobody asked me to come in
how much experience you have got?
they won't let you sit in front of the client directly
why they cannot make me sit? If I have done good work, then they shall give its credit too
Sir Zeeshan & sir Jibran's team will take the entire credit
do you think its fair?
life is not fair, bro
I will talk to sir Zeeshan
have you gone mad?
wait... no Farhad
its good, now sell it
aunt Shaggo
we want to discuss something with you
what is it? Is everything fine?
if you have learnt a bit of Gujrati from me then you wouldn't be making such faces
ashamed of you!
aunt... 
speak up
we were thinking to invite Fareeha in your wedding
Fareeha?
we thought its a good chance
as of yet, brother Yousuf doesn't want to listen to her name
then think about something aunt, how is this possible that Fareeha shall not attend your wedding
even I want to invite her
then please talk to them, just try once
you guys will get me killed
Okay, let me try
lets think something
Farhad
yes
you came early today?
yes
how many times I have told you not to make mess in the room in this manner
just now I've seen that wet towel, and its stinking
sorry
what happened?
Nothing
office issues
which issues?
my manager...
he is such an ill-mannered guy
first he appreciated my presentation
then he used my presentation & took me out of it
also he didn't gave me any credit
not even a single person in our office knows that I had made that presentation
well...
you are a new employee there
it will take some time to make your place, ok?
I don't know
I don't think so that this job is right for me
we don't have any other option as well, Farhad
give it some time, we have to compromise a bit then everything gets well
Fareeha, I don't think so that I will get a chance to grow in this company
Ok fine, see...
you can switch if you find some better opportunity
meanwhile compromise a bit
Ok?
would you like to drink tea? Let me make it
No, you sit let me go & make it
you have cooked the food in the morning as well, so let me go & make tea now
whoever wants to come shall come, and whoever doesn't want to shall not come
now I won't be going to everyone & request them
brother Yousuf, I want to talk to you about something
yes, tell me dear
its good that all of you are present here
I want to talk to you
is everything alright, that everyone wants to talk today. Tell me, what is it?
We cannot attend this wedding
what do you mean?
do I have to explain it?
we have been defamed in the entire community, almost more than half of the guests have refused to come to the wedding
dear, whether anyone comes or not. Why shall we care?
But the entire family is with Shaggo, ok?
only you are with aunt Shaggo & with Fareeha, dad
the way we are getting insulted in this family, you don't care about it
and when there is no importance of our words & respect. Then what's the big deal if we attend this wedding or not
don't fight because of me
Saqib...
one minute...
I am not asking you but telling you, got it?
its your hand in bringing our family on this verge, dad
you don't care about respect at all
but I do care about my honor & reputation
I have to save myself for the sake of my family's future
try to keep down your phone sometimes, Farhad
you are not at home the entire day, and as soon as you come back you get stick to it
give me some time as well
so I am sitting with you
but your attention is not on me
Fareeha, I am trying to relax for sometime after doing the entire day's hard work. What's wrong?
hmm... so you get relaxed by this?
please check who is there
who is it?
mom!
my child... 
mom... 
Greetings aunty!
how are you?
I am fine mom, how are you?
I am not fine
I am not happy
it seems as if I am a living corpse
at least don't say this
I was thinking that you are upset with me
you didn't come to meet me
also you didn't call me
don't you know your dad? Ask him
how I came to meet you today
just keep coming to meet me
ok?
I won't be able to come again & again
and yes, I am upset with you
who does this?
you've turned away your face from your mother
didn't you miss me even once?
I couldn't sleep
what else I could have done, mom?
everything was infront of you
nobody had the courage to take stand for me in front of dad
I didn't had any shelter, but dad didn't gave me some place in his house
neither there is any place for me in dad's house, mom
nor in his heart
you are the son of that house
your place is there
only yours
forget her by considering it a mistake, and come back
lets go
what are you saying, mom?
she is my wife
is this how marriages happen?
this is some joke, not a marriage
what do you want? Let me beg you to come back
your mother is begging in front of you. Come back to us
ask her, what does she think
she will be able to live happily after ruining a mom's family?
aunt, what are you saying?
I am saying the right thing
its all her doing, her mistake
No, its not her mistake
its my own decision, mom
and what do you think? If I will go back with you today then dad will forgive me?
or will he give me a hug?
I don't remember how does it feel to hug your father
maybe he might have hugged me on some Eid or so & that too because he is giving a hug to everyone in the line
so he had to hug me as well forcefully
he doesn't want a son but an animal who shall say "yes" on his every command
Farhad!
you know I am saying the right thing
 tell me honestly
had father talked to politely ever?
or can you speak anything in front of him?
did he talk to you politely?
I've been observing it since I was so small. You used to get panic attacks as soon as dad used to enter the house
you shiver badly
but does anyone have the courage to speak in front of dad?
He did whatever he wanted to. But what is my son doing?
What are you doing?
How are you talking to me?
You've left your mom, you were my only support there
mom, leave that house
come to me
the matter is not only of Fareeha, mom
maybe I have got the courage to leave that house because of Fareeha
but the truth is that house was never mine
neither its people
I cannot go back, mom
and if you have come to take me back home
and that too without Fareeha
so please go back
aunt, we are getting calls from home
we should leave now
lets go Jojo
I came to bring back my son
but my son is not here
lets go
the mother whom you are rejecting
Your paradise lies under her feet
remember this!
lets go, Jojo
can't you talk to your mom politely?
Jojo, lets go!
lets go
what wrong Saqib is saying?
now you don't start, stop it!
do you know what is your problem?
I don't know, but you will tell me
you worry about everyone in this house, except for your own son
what rubbish your are talking?
I am saying absolutely correct thing
he is your only son
he has to handle everything in the future
but you never took any suggestion from him in the business or in house related matters
so he will react obviously
sometimes I get so worried because of Saqib's thinking
and I've started to get worried because of your thinking sometimes
what not we had faced because of Shaggo & Fareeha?
Saqib has never annoyed you
but don't know why do you consider him as your enemy
I am telling you Mr. Yousuf
if our son leaves this house because of your stubbornness
then I will never forgive you
never!
but.. 
what problem is this?
she never understands anything
oh... 
Farhad, come.. the breakfast is ready
come, have breakfast
No I am not hungry
at least have some
No Fareeha, today I will do it in the office
are you okay?
whatever happened with your mom yesterday, I know it must be very upsetting for you
I am sorry that because of me.. 
Fareeha, I had said to you yesterday as well
that its not your mistake
don't know why I had felt for a few seconds that mom had started to give importance to my decisions
but no
she only wants her son back at home
no matter even if I get divorced
show me
she is your mother, Farhad
she must be missing you
I cannot pay such a hefty cost for it, Fareeha
anyways.. 
leave this topic
I don't want to think about the past
but I only want to think about our future
I am getting late for office, so I am leaving
shall I pack your lunch?
No, thank you!
hello!
Greetings!
Greetings! Are you Ms. Dangerous husband?
yes... Fareeha
yes yes, I am the the husband of that bad-tempered woman
we couldn't meet properly
actually the matter is that we have to be really cautious in the fight of these women. Specially you & me
we have to act tactfully, got it?
yes
Okay, the actual matter in my mind is that what I forgot to tell you. Actually my mind doesn't work when my tea gets cold
day after tomorrow is a religious festival
and on that day, we decorate our entire building every year
we enjoy a lot, the kids play with the firecrackers
we pray for the entire night, also there are various eatables too
its such a good thing
both of you shall also come
but what about that bad-tempered aunt?
Umm.. I mean that... 
Channo
yes Channo aunty...
Channo
won't she mind?
all the families from our building comes, everyone attends it
and what's the need for you to tell that who has invited you. Maybe the person from 4D, or 5C has invited you
both of you shall come, that's it
Okay
dear look...
understand one thing
when there are two lioness in a battlefield, then one should learn the tactics of war
its important to learn them
got it?
yes
Ok go, Miss Dangerous must be waiting for you
Bye!
cold tea...
