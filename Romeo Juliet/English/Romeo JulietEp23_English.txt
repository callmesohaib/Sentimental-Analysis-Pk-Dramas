Why should I? Say whatever you want about me, I've been hearing it since I was a child.
But I won't wear a word against her.
Then get out of here!
They picked me up and took me here.
Why is it locked. Open this lock! This is my wife.
The place we found you..
We can't ignore that so easily.
Stay at the police station for the night. We'll look at this in the morning.
Musa has arranged for a place.
It's his cousin's flat.
He's shifted to Saudia Arab, and his flat hasn't been sold yet.
We can stay there until it's sold.
Since he knows us he's not even asking for an advance.
Everything will be better.
I told you not to expect much from them.
They don't care about love.
Don't worry, please. I'm here with you and I'll always will.
I will never let tears come to your eyes.
I will fill your life with happiness. I promise
Just give us some time.
Trust me.
Please.
Shall we go now? To our home?
Musa was telling me that it had been closed for quite a while.
I can see that.
Anyways, we'll clean it up and make it all better.
Where is Farhad living?
He's staying at a friend's flat.
It was hard for them to arrange for it. There were so many problems that I can't even mention them.
Look at what Farhad has done and father's anger won't cool down.
He won't listen to anyone.
Ask me how I'm living here.
I've even a set time for me to go to the bathroom.
I've made a schedule so that he doesn't see me.
Tell me one thing...
yes
at the last moment you called Farhad and asked him to run away.
yes
How did you know that he was coming after him?
Farhad gave his address and I wanted to meet him.
And Shahzain found out and he gave the address to Friya's brother.
Why?
Why did he do that?
What do you mean? He hasn't forgotten his fight with Farhad and after this he has completely turned against him.
I don't understand what's gotten into him.
Maybe...
Maybe I wasn't able to recognize him.
Is he treating your properly? Did he say something?
Come and check your father's blood pressure, he's not letting me check it.
May God have mercy.
Auntie, do you want me to come?
No, I don't want his blood pressure to increase. Kiran, come.
Hamid...
how are you, brother Yousuf?
sit down.
How come you're here?
Brother Yousuf, I went to the shop and saw that you weren't there...
that's why I came here to ask of your health.
I'm sure you know. Because of Fariya I can't show my face anywhere.
Hello... how are you?
I'm well...
Where's Rashda?
Sister is sleeping.
Don't disturb her, let her rest. I came here to talk to brother Yousuf.
The thing is, brother Yousuf your name has meaning in our community.
You've helped a lot of people.
You've made a name in your craft, that won't just vanish just because of your daughter's mistake.
But it can get stained.
Brother Yousuf, the people will talk about it and then forget it in a few days.
Who forgets things like this?
People don't forget these things. I'm so embarrassed.
How will I face people at the shop?
Let the boys work for a few days,
but one day or another you'll have to come back towards your life.
People like you should always stand firm.
They are kids and they all have to come home one day.
The doors to this house is closed for her forever.
I admit it's very hard, but brother Yousuf I will say one thing...
This time heals all wounds, no matter how big they are.
Give it some time, everything will be alright.
That's what I came here to tell you.
One more thing, people like me still say your name with respect.
Thank you very much. It feels nice to hear this.
Of course.
Here you are.
Thank you.
After a long time I've seen brother Yousuf smile like that.
It seems that your words...
has eased the burden on his heart.
I don't have kids, so I can't understand the weight of his pain.
Tell me one thing...
Why do parents take their children mistake so personally?
Hamid, this is not a small mistake.
You are right, but Fariya is the one who made the mistake. She's the one who needs to pick up the weight.
There should be no need for you and brother Yousuf to hide your faces from the world.
He earned this respect all his life,
it can't just go away so cheaply.
That doesn't happen,
but it seems that...
you should come here daily.
And you should meet brother Yousuf...
and speak similar things to him. Because if you do...
then maybe he'll come out of this depression.
I don't mind at all, this way I'll get to meet you daily.
What do you want to do by meeting me daily?
You'll know that soon enough.
Alright then, I'll get going.
You're up...
What is all this?
Nothing, I couldn't sleep at night so I decided...
to clean the flat a little bit.
A little bit?
You cleaned everything. I didn't hear anything. Where is all the stuff?
I didn't know that you were such a deep sleeper.
I thought the the noise would disturb you...
but you didn't even move...
Alright, don't worry.
These sofas are fine. We'll get new fabrics, have them polished and they'll be good as new.
We can put the TV over there.
And... we'll get a new carpets... and this entire place will pop up.
It's not like I haven't thought about the bedroom...
We'll get a bed... two side tables
and a dressing table. It will be all good then.
Don't you like it?
You did all of this alone, for me?
Friya...
I know that you deserve more than this...
I can't give you much right now...
but I'm trying to keep you comfortable here.
I'll set this all gradually... promise.
We'll make this our home Farhad, together.
I'm sorry...
I've put a lot of burden on you, right?
You're not a burden, you are my responsibility.
You are my life.
Do you have a problem?
What are you saying?
Don't you fancy my Gujrati?
No you are too good...
now come on... feed me the breakfast you've made me.
Come on.
I don't see father anywhere. Saqib asked me to give this to him.
He's gone out with Hamid.
What are you doing?
The plastic tore off, so I'm replacing it.
I find something around this house to distract myself.
I miss Friya very much.
Stop missing her.
People have stopped meeting us.
You were so social before. It was so distracting for you.
And father has been meeting Hamid quite a lot lately.
There are a few people who meet us respectfully now.
It's good that he spends time with Hamid nowadays...
It keeps him distracted.
He forgets his pain.
They will be good friends.
Yes for him and aunt Shaggo as well.
Shaggo?
Don't you know? Aunt Shaggo is good friends with Hamid.
They meet in the park everyday.
Didn't you see how aunt Shaggo puts on her joggers and leaves at five in the evening?
Shaggo has always gone on her walks.
There's hop in her step now.
She applies lipstick before she goes, before that she only took her scarf before she left.
But now she make special preparations.
It's good. Aunt Shaggo has found herself a distraction.
All hell broke loose on our house.
People are still watching us...
Aunt Shaggo should be careful,
we don't want to give the people the opportunity to talk.
People already say, like aunt, like niece.
Mother you are very naive.
You should keep an eye on what's going on in your house.
I'm saying this for your well being, otherwise you know I stay out of people's business.
Where are the AC remotes, let's replace the plastic for them as well.
It's good you can't find them. If you can't find the remotes, you can't turn on the ACs.
Besides the electricity is getting expensive, the bill is too much.
You guys should turn it on less.
And not at all from 5:30 to 10:30, it's peak hours.
That deflected on me. I'll have to sit in the heat now.
Do what mother is asking you to do. Give her the jewelry.
Don't you hear me? Give her the jewelry!
Kiran hurry up, it's my cousin's wedding, he won't like it if we're late.
I'm coming...
Shall we?
Wait a second...
Where did you get this from?
My parents gave it to me.
Alright... this girl is such a fool.
You know how things are nowadays, what if someone steals it?
I'll hide it.
No, we can't take any chance. Give it to me.
I'll keep it inside.
She doesn't trust your mother, it's not like it has diamonds encrusted on it.
In our family girls hand their jewelry to their mother-in-law the very first day.
And look at her, she's so clever hiding like it.
It's my belonging...
Who does it belong to?
From tomorrow she won't sit on the sofa...
because it belongs to us.
Shahzain I didn't mean that...
I buy the ration as well, so she won't be eating as well...
Once she stays hungry for a few days she'll stop talking back.
Do as mother says, give her the jewelry.
Don't you hear me? Give her the jewelry!
It's so light, I wonder why she was acting so possessive.
I'll keep this away... and I'll get something for her neck.
Do you see...
how much she cares for you. Why do you do this?
Hurry up mother.
This is what you call a set, and it matches as well.
Take off these earring and wear these matching ones.
Hurry up, we're getting late!
These are how sets are supposed to be.
Why are you standing idly, wear them and come out.
Mom, I am waiting outside
Come on wear them now!
What are you doing?
I'm correcting my CVs, once I get some leads, I'll apply for a job.
You'll find a job quickly.
If only the one conducting the interview has the same confidence in me.
Shall we have something tasty for breakfast today?
Sure.
Really?
Yeah sure...
Really...
Then go ahead!
Where?
To make breakfast.
Me?
Who else then?
I thought you would make it.
I make it daily...
Putting butter on toast isn't making breakfast.
I make the tea as well.
Then make me a delicious omelet as well.
A delicious omelet?
I don't know how to make an omelet.
Then what can you make?
Make me halwa puri!
Am I cookbook?
What do you mean?
Where will I learn to make halwa puri?
You had a catering business, right?
My father did, not me.
So what? You grew up around food, you must have learned something.
What does that mean? If you like eating so much...
do you know how to cook?
Why?
I like to eat, not to cook.
Sure...
Farhad, I'm starving. I've become toast eating this toast!
Please... please... make me an omelet.
How hard can it be?
Come on... let's try...
Go ahead!
What?
Come on miss.
Where?
I can't make it alone.
We'll make it together.
I won't... you can make it alone!
Hit it with a spoon and open it up.
Do one thing...
Chop the vegetables, I'll take a look at it...
Greetings Hamid, you're here?
How are you brother?
I'm well, sit down.
We were supposed to head out late, right? The market won't be open right now.
I came early...
Everything alright?
I want to talk to you about something important.
Sure, what is it?
Brother Yousuf you know I don't have any elders...
And... my family isn't here, so I came to talk to you.
What are you saying, we're your family.
Say whatever you want.
Thank you. You have encouraged me by saying this.
If I have your permission, I would like to marry your sister Shaggo.
Marry Shaggo...
Do you mind?
No...
Did you talk to Shaggo about this?
How could I have without talking to you first? We'll proceed how you like it.
I...
can't believe it. I didn't expect Shaggo to get a proposal under the circumstances.
I'll talk to Shaggo, don't worry.
Sure...
Greetings.
We have a proposal for Shaggo.
A proposal?
Yes.
For Shaggo?
What is this shamelessness?
What's the shame?
It's shameless to marry at such an age.
When will you sister stop embarrassing us? 
All her life she kept filling our daughter's ears.
Because of her our daughter is away from us.
Because of her?
You have a veil over your eyes as well.
Have some mercy on us.
We are already become a joke in our community.
We couldn't marry off our daughter, so we'll marry off Shaggo.
 I don't know what's happening in our home!
I should get going.
Sit down Hamid.
You two should talk, I'll get going.
Alright, farewell.
I can't hear anymore. Reject this proposal right away.
I would be grateful if you do.
Farhad!
Move your legs Farhad!
You're there...
Where else?
Weren't you here just now?
No... I was out preparing for my interview.
Are you joking?
What's the matter?
Brother... brother...
Brother, get up..
Get up...
What happened sister? What's the noise?
There are rats in our house.
So what?
Take them out...
What do you mean? They live here.
What do you mean by that?
What I mean to say is that...
there are a lot of rats around here. They even bite the ears in the back alley, 
but these ones don't say anything.
Don't worry... go to sleep.
I won't go upstairs. You take a bill for the maintenance, right?
Get up and go to work. Remove those rats from our house!
Do you give the electricity bill?
Of course we do.
Is there any electricity, no. You give the water bill, is there any water bill? No.
You pay the gas bill, but is there any gas? 
No. We take money from you for maintenance...
Don't you dare complete your sentence, otherwise Farhad will gather all the rats and throw them on you!
What are you saying?
Farhad, he won't listen to us if we're polite. Get up and remove those rats!
It's not my job. I'm sure your place is dirty and they were attracted to the smell.
How dare he say that? Have you seen the filth around your building?
There are piles of trash! I'm sure they smelled that.
Friya, wait a minute! We're new here, please come up.
Why are you saying please? This is his job and he's shying away from it.
It's not my job to remove rats.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. You can rat traps in the morning.
Farhad, I won't sleep upstairs with rats.
As you wish, I can't do anything...
Friya... he's right...
You're taking his side.
I'm not!
What should we do now?
Did you hear what he say? It makes no difference to him...
How can rats and people live together, these people are so uneducated...
Are you guys news here?
You are the ones who create noise and we are uneducated?
Auntie mind your business. please... 
This is my business, I'm the manager of the building.
People vote for me.
Who do you think I am?
I can see how much you've worked.
If you don't like it, then you can do it.
Auntie, do you know how much work there is in your building. 
How many rats there are! Farhad, let me talk!
Will you look at rats?
I'm not your auntie, should I get you a room in Buckingham palace?
Seems like she is Sultan Rai's niece!
What happened?
Nothing, go to sleep... it's just a glass of water.
It's nothing.
I've spent my entire life with you, but your snores...
are still the same.
I've never heard it. Give me your hand...
Once I go to sleep, you can take it away.
The entire world can burn, whilst you only care about yourself.
I have to hand it to you. Go to sleep!
Go... check if everything's clear.
You come as well.
First you go.
Fariya, it's only a rat... not a dinosaur. Go ahead!
Keep the broom upwards.
Come here!
Farhad!
Farhad!
What happened?
Everything is clear.
Everything is clear.
Show me the body.
Everything is clear, right?
Yes... it is... I've closed the doors and windows as well.
Nothing will be coming in now.
Farhad, this is all because of you.
What do you mean? Did I call them here by playing a flute?
Have you seen the kitchen? It's so dirty...
Hello... I throw my trash...
So... who will wash the pans... you can clean them...
I should cook and throw the trash as well. How's that fair?
Farhad please, don't talk to me like you make Chinese for me everyday.
You make lentils and eggs that's it!
And it's not like I don't know how to do anything.
I'm telling you off?
Fariya, I have a job interview tomorrow. I need to sleep.
This is enough for today, shall we?
I've check it a million times... there's nothing there.
I can't sleep there.
Stay here... I'll go.
Farhad!
