who misses those daughters who leaves the house after ruining their parents honor?
So why my mother cannot say such things to me while looking into my eyes?
what are you doing here as of yet? 
Hamid & Shaggo had invited you, and they've gone
so what are you doing here? 
now don't waste my time
do you want to leave me? Will you leave me so easily, answer me!
will you leave me so easily? will you leave me? 
why do you hurt me again & again, Kiran. Why!
take these 2 right now
you need to take green & orange one after lunch
don't know where I have kept it
listen...
Did Kiran come?
did you talk to her?
yes
what do you mean by "yes"?
what was she saying?
was everything fine?
she got injured so..
she was saying that she got injured by the corner of the table
Thank God!
I got worried...
that may God keeps everything fine, don't know what had happened
are you so worried for your daughter?
obviously
she is my daughter
I was also someone's daughter, Yaqoob
I agree...
that my anger is way too much
Maybe sometimes, I don't used to treat you well
but what I could do?
the situation of my business wasn't good
then the household expenses
also the tension of many other things
I used to take out someone else's anger at home
I do realize my mistake
but for whom I was doing that
I did everything for you all, and..
even I had said the same thing to Kiran
sometimes, if her husband raises his hand in anger
then it doesn't mean that he is a bad person
it only means that her bad time is going on
which is written in her fate
my mother used to explain me the same thing
don't worry
Our Kiran is exactly like me
'Patient'
she will also handle whatever is written in her fate
get out of my house!
Yaqoob!
be quiet!
Quiet!
Yaqoob...
Yaqoob!
Fareeha, Jojo was saying sorry for the lamp
its ok
Okay I am going to the gym to watch match with my friends
I will come after the match ends
are you serious?
yes, means?
Farhad, we had planned for so long that today we'll go out for the dinner
and you've made your own plans without discussing with me
so, we'll go next week
why are you talking like a typical girl?
because you are talking like a typical boy
have you seen the condition of our room?
I've told you thousands of time, to put the wet towel outside. Don't throw it on the bed like this
if I would have explained this to a 2 years kid, then he would have understood it by now
so, I am not a 2 year old kid
and you aren't my mom
what difference does it make, if I haven't kept something on its right place?
I am a human, not a robot
absolutely correct! What difference does it make?
only your wife gets troubled
so who is asking you to get troubled?
 Did I ask you?
if I don't make efforts in this house, then even your perfume would be lying here or there without its cap
one minute Fareeha, first think what is the problem!
is the perfume problem? friends? or Cricket match?
What is the problem!
everything!
Sorry, I am such a bad guy
do you even realize a bit that how much you've embarrassed me in front of my parents?
I told everyone that its chill, we'll watch the match at home as Fareeha is such a chill lady
but you've humiliated me in front of everyone!
you are right, I've humiliated you a lot in front of your friends. So, go to them
go
Fareeha, you weren't so harsh before our marriage
Farhad, even you weren't so cheap & careless before our wedding
I am like this! if you want to stay with me then tolerate me in this way
what's the matter? You seem quite happy since your father-in-law had visited you
it seems that... 
didn't he gave you the car keys?
oh mom, it will be a lot more than this & much better. Don't worry
and do you know, Kiran's father catering business is about to get transferred on my name
are you telling the truth?
So, will you sit in the kitchen now?
oh mom, who is going to sit there
let it get transferred on my name once, I will sell it right away
it has commercial value, so we'll get hefty price of it
Oh wow! We'll become so rich then
mom, just pray that it gets transferred on my name once. Then you'll see what I will do
hey Jojo, our team isn't playing well
it happens...
oh look, who is here!
So...
did you get the permission from your wife?
he didn't get the permission, in fact he got ousted from the house
look at his face!
oh yes, look... it seems he got beaten up
Hero... did you had a fight with your wife?
I don't understand her
I mean, in a minute... she talks to me with so much of love, she is so sweet & caring
and on the next minute, she gets completely crazy!
I mean, what's the big deal if I didn't put my socks in the laundry basket?
I also do so many work, did I ever mention?
No, right?
what's the big deal if I haven't put my wet towel on its place?
yes, it seems that Pakistan & India's match is started at Farhad's house
and his wife got him out on the very first ball
brother look, I am not married as of yet to give you suggestions
but I am giving you an important suggestion, so take it
See, try to agree with her on petty matters & ignore big matters
this is the secret of a successful marriage, dad had told me
oh man, stop your rubbish!
he is asking me to apply the suggestions of nineties in 2024
brother, do you want a suggestion from nowadays?
Nowadays, equal partnership is being practiced
whose socks are dirty?
Yours!
So, you'll pick them & put them in the basket
yes!
are you getting my point?
this is being practiced nowadays
got his point?
yes?
and wet towel! everyone hates it as it is
are you on my side or her side?
I am on the side of correct thing
he is on the correct side!
it was all his mistake
he broke the lamp & made me stand in front of her
you are talking wrong. Look, I didn't break the lamp, don't put the blame on me
the lamp broke along with your wife's patience
its a delicate matter, try to understand
stop your rubbish! 
I came to watch match, so let me see that
Out out!
oh wow, this is great!
yes
greetings aunt Channo, I need a favor. Can I get some sugar, as I don't have it
Greetings dear, yes yes. Come inside, come on
thank you!
Wow... Wow!
Greetings!
he won't be able to hear anything at this time
but what happens to men while watching a match?
till date, I didn't know that Farhad watches cricket
and today he is so bad about cricket that he is unable to understand anything else
you are newly married, that's why
slowly & gradually, you'll start seeing so many things
then you'll feel like getting disappeared
then how to earn a livelihood?
whatever things you are disliking about him
maybe, he also dislikes a few things about you too
its not necessary that both of you like the same thing
the important thing is that one shall value the likes of another person
its difficult in the beginning
but slowly & gradually everything gets fine
when we are in love with someone, we wait for hours for the person to call us
and then we talk with that person for hours
but all of it happens before marriage
after marriage, one has to see the other person's face on daily basis
and it get boring, like we are from each other
anyways...
but...
do you know, what is the real test?
the real test is in silence
either you become frustrated by staying silent
or...
you get peace by each others silence
this is the real test
not in talks
the matter hasn't reached to silence as of yet, because we fight before that
there is a lot to say that..
you are young & emotional
slowly & gradually, you'll become patience with time
but... you need to do handwork to reach to that level
that's it? Is it done?
yes? what happened?
No, I mean... the same way a lamp broke in my house today
I had brought that lamp with so much of love
Actually, I am so possessive about my things
but it didn't made any difference to Farhad
the way you don't like his match, maybe the same way he didn't like your lamp
the way you love your lamp
Farhad loves cricket the same way, so tolerate it
think...
work hard... and don't get yourself trapped in such a petty matters
Ok look, since the lamp is broken so now you have to bring a new lamp too. Right?
this is beneficial!
ok listen
if you ever miss your family, house or mother. Then come to me
I feel good whenever you visit me
Thank you!
Greetings mom!

I came to meet him
I didn't know that it will happen

I can't come, you go
why?
Boss had told me to roam around with that toothpaste client who is coming from Lahore
I have to take extra care of him
take him on the lunch, on the dinner... entertain him
its easy, look at the positive side of it
also, you aren't taking him on your own expense.
you'll also have lunch & dinner on the company's expense
also you'll get rid of the work
what rubbish is this? I have to do office work too after coming back
and he is coming from Lahore, not from America
roam around with him..
Do I look like a tour guide?
