You have an appointment with the doctor at 12 noon tomorrow. Don't forget.
What are you thinking? No excuses.
I want to meet Farhad.
What? Why?
I cannot see Fariha's condition.
Whatever it is, he's her husband.
Have you forgotten what he has done?
Everything is changing Rashida.
The place where the story started, the place we were at, circumstances have changed.
We have changed.
I won my children back after losing them.
I now stand proud.
I don't want to be stubborn and affect my childrens' lives.
Yes but, if Saqib sees Farhad, he'll become very angry
We'll see to it when it happens.
Right now I want to meet the boy who brought tears in my daughter's eyes.
If things reach the point of divorce, they are given time for that.
I won't make a mistake this time. I'll think first.
Alright. I'll think about everything carefully.
Can I sit here?
Sit down. You've never asked me earlier.
Are you alright?
Yes. Why?
Because you were in a similar condition earlier. I had Farhad now.
Ever since he has come in your life, he has been hurting you.
But whenever you're with him, you're the happiest.
I want to hit him. So irritating. Do you want to talk to him? Should I make you talk?
No. This time nobody is stopping me to talk to him. I just can't do it myself.
And maybe he doesn't want to do it either.
Alright. If love hurts so much, I'll break up with my girlfriend.
I don't want to take depression medicines.
You don't need to take depression medicine. You can have ice creams.
Do you want some? I'll have some too. Lets go.
Farhad.. how did all this happen?
I don't understand. They're the same people.
They're working with the same method.
God knows where the problem is. I don't understand.
There are people outside the catering house. They're demanding answers.
Alright. What should we do now?
Shamshad has gone with the food sample to the laboratory.
We'll soon find out what the problem was.
I'm telling you, something was mixed in the food. I checked everything myself.
Everything was fine. Nothing was spoiled. Each and every spice is fresh.
Who did it? Who could do it?
Who is it at this hour? God, let everything be alright.
Can I come in?
Yes. Please come in.
Hello.
Hello.
This is Fariha's dad.
Hello.
Hello.
Please come. Sit down.
I'll get water..
No..
Water is fine.
I wanted to talk to you.
About Fariha.
What happened to Fariha? Is everything alright?
Yes Fariha is alright.
See, I wasn't happy about your relationship.
Neither was your family but still you people got married.
Now whether we accept it or not, what difference does it make. The relationship exists.
Then you talked to Fariha about divorce.
I don't want my daughter to spend her entire life waiting for someone.
She cannot gather the courage to take a decision.
Do you still want to divorce her?
Oh.. where are you barging in?
Who is Farhad?
Yes. Its me.
So you feed people spoilt food at your restaurant?
There is a misunderstanding.
Enough.
Someone is planning against us.
There has been an FIR against him. He's going in for long.
He's very stubborn. Take him along Shehzad.
Brother...
I'll come back later. Bye.
We'll do something. Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Farhad is coming back.
I'll go and see. I'll find out.
Mom? Farhad is coming back. Nothing is wrong.
Dear, take care. I'll go and see.
I told you not to go there. Have you seen now? Are you satisfied?
See, that family has a lot of problems.
The boy must be nice but why do you need to push your daughter there?
Shaboo was telling me that he has already gone to jail because he picked a fight.
What?
Yes and you should see for yourself. Again he's involved with the police.
His restaurant has been sealed and there are so many other problems.
Why do you need to send your daughter there?
I'd say, don't even mention it to Fariha.
She'll become emotional without any reason.
I think you should get the divorce deed made soon and be rid of all this chaos.
Sir, there is a misunderstanding. We don't know how this happened.
Sir, we've been in the catering business for long.
We have respect here and trust us, this has never happened before. And even today,
we took care of each and everything before the food was cooked. How did this happen?
Are you talking about Kareem Baksh Pakwaan Centre.
Yes sir. Yes.
Oh.. you two are here. This is amazing. Ever since Mr. Yaqoob passed away,
his son is intent upon destroying whatever was left of his business.
Oh no, sir. No.
Our son is working with a lot of responsibility.
Yes we can see that.
We have 25 complaints against him and some people are in the hospital.
Sir, you should go forward with your investigation.
Whoever has done this with us, we want to get hold of that wretched man.
We'll support you throughout.
And who is he sitting there?
No sir. No.
He isn't the one. This is our family business. We'll never cheat ourselves.
He looks like a thug from his face and on top of that his antics aren't good either.
Khuda Baksh, put him in the lock up.
And you, please arrange for a lawyer. This case will stretch now.
How are you Fariha?
I'm fine.
I also told your dad that our daughter is fine.
If she won't get better at her own house, then where?
He was asking about you.  He's worried.
Why?
For your future.
What have you thought?
Mom, I think I should talk to Farhad.
Did he try and talk to you?
Why are you running behind such a useless relationship that has nothing but pain for you?
You do know that your dad, Saqib and everybody else forgave you after a lot of hassle.
A lot of people are still asking why we kept you back in our house.
You're our daughter, our blood, our life. Relationships don't end.
But dear, I beg of you. For God's sake.
Don't be stupid enough to jump in this blind well again.
You have all your life.
Think about yourself. Think about your future.
Get a divorce.
Farhad will try to pull you back.
But you have to move on, for yourself.
For us.
I'm sure someone mixed something in the food.
I can tell without looking at the report. I understood that day only.
There is a mess.
Alright, but who did it?
Maybe a competitor did it.
Everybody has their eyes on us.
But all the caterers in this area are like us.
Spreading rumors about spoiled food is different but entering in our kitchen,
this is someone getting revenge.
Did you ask the guys?
Yes, I hung them all upside down. Its none of them. But..
Yes, a boy is missing since that day.
Who?
He was a new guy. Farhad hired out of sympathy. You know how gracious he is with young kids.
There was a small kid. He must have done something.
Somebody must have told him to do it.
First we'll get hold of the boy and then we'll find out who gave him the orders.
Do you think we're mad to do this to our own catering business?
Why doesn't the police believe us?
God knows how my child will be?
Mom, be strong.
Uncle has gone to talk to the lawyer and Jojo is looking for that boy. We'll find a way soon.
You just keep praying.
Hello?
What did you think? You'll get rid of me so easily?
Shahzain? What did you do?
Nothing.
I just taught a lesson.
Maybe you'll learn to respect your husband now.
Husband and respect.. both of these words sound ill from your mouth. You don't know the meaning of either.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you want your brother to not spend his entire life behind bars, do as I say.
What do you want?
You..
And the catering business.
Now first of all, you'll come back home and name the business to me.
Listen to me with open ears. Nothing will happen, Shahzain.
Oh..
Then your brother will rot behind bars and the catering business will remain sealed.
Now you'll decide for your brother's fate and the last memoir of your father.
Shahzain..
You're her only sympathizer, we're his enemies.
Make him understand. Teach him how to talk. Knock some sense into him.
Did you send him with a sieve when God was distributing sense?
I agree that I'm short tempered and sometimes I didn't treat you well.
I'd vent out my frustration on you.
I do realize my mistake.
Brother, there is a big problem.
Yes, we cannot understand anything.
The lawyer said such cases are usually dragged.
Its important to find that boy. He'll clear our name or else Farhad will remain in jail.
Farhad is in jail?
Yes. Someone contaminated the food at the restaurant.
The catering business is sealed and Farhad is in jail.
We cannot find that new boy.
Who? Rashid?
You know him?
I keep tabs on everyone.
I found out he's working in another shop.
Do you know where he lives?
We'll find out Jojo.
We'll do anything for our brother Farhad. Don't you worry.
You're a tiger! How long do you need to find out?
Until tomorrow morning.
We'll barge into his house tomorrow and beat him up well!
Get us some tea.
I'm sorry Ramsha.
See, I made a big mistake when I raised my hand on you.
I know I shouldn't have done it. Please forgive me.
If you keep yourself in my place, you'll know how helpless I am.
I am not giving you any reason, I'm just apologizing.
I'm telling you the truth, I really love you and my unborn child.
But loving doesn't mean I'll wrong my parents.
Think about it yourself. If I do injustice with them today, what will our child do with us?
Please Ramsha, forgive me.
Even I should apologize.
I didn't realize how selfish I became. I hurt you as well.
My motherhood became so merciless
that I cannot believe it.
I'm very guilty Saqib.
Forgive me please.
Please don't apologize.
You will not go back there.
Uncle, Farhad is in jail. What will become of him?
I couldn't think Shahzain could go to this extent.
Yes.
He crossed all limits the day he hit you.
Such a man can do anything.
Your aunt is right.
Mom.. Farhad is in jail, how long will he stay there?
Shahzain has become crazy obsessed. He won't back down.
So we won't back down as well.
I truly believe Farhad will come out of this problem. He's innocent.
I will talk to the lawyer. He'll find a way out. Shahzain has accepted that he has done it.
If God wills, we'll find a proof as well.
How can I sacrifice one of my child to save another?
You've already sacrificed a lot.
Its decided.
You're not going back.
We'll find another way out.
Dad?
Yes dear.
I wanted to talk to you.
Alright.
Please get the divorce papers ready.
Are you sure?
I know what this relationship is worth to Farhad.
First he couldn't communicate.
And now he has stopped all communication. I can't spend my life like this.
I knew it already. It had to happen.
Sister in law, I want to talk to you.
You should have called me.
Please sit down.
The decision you took for Kiran today,
I know it wasn't easy for you but you did absolutely right.
I don't know brother,
sometimes I feel that our children are suffering the outcome of our own mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes. I apologize to you.
What are you doing? Why?
I couldn't do anything for you.
Yaqoob's attitude wasn't good with you.
Why are you saying this? You're embarrassing me.
I know brother, you always tried to make Yaqoob understand tactfully.
You were an exemplary good husband but its about nature.
Both of you were brothers, brought up in the same household
and such different perspectives.
You're an example for all of us. Please don't lose courage. I'm with you.
We will pull our children out of this mess. Don't consider yourself alone, ever.
I pray to God to end all difficulties my children are facing.
I told you I'd find the location.
They're punks who look for ways to get money out of people like you and Farhad.
Once we get them..
Do you look like a cheap person or are you really one?
What nonsense is this? Why are you laughing?
Come on my brother. Truth is always bitter.
I have such a good face.
I'm already in a bad mood. I'm telling you..
This is his street.
And his house is a little far away. Be careful.
Is this it?
Where is his house?
Its there.
Keep an eye out.
Catch him. He's running..
He turned out to be spider man.
He isn't spider man, you're slow. Whats the use of you hitting the gym?
I didn't have my protein shake.
You should be ashamed.
You lost him. I told you they were punks.
Come on now.
You wasted all my hard work.
I'm coming. Wait.
Yes? Hello.
Farhad Karim Baksh?
This is his house.
Please receive his letter.
But he's not at home.
Then please you receive it and sign here.
Thank you.
Fariha, my child?
Have you really decided to divorce him?
This is a very difficult decision.
What else could I do aunt?
Should I keep waiting for a man who didn't even ask about me? 
He just decided he would free me of this relationship?
Fariha, relationships don't involve ego. 
You should have asked.
I tried.
I called him. He didn't even call back.
Aunt, everything changed once we got married.
He also changed. 
And perhaps I as well.
Fariha, everything changes.
The relationship isn't the same nor are the human beings.
Aunt, you were absolutely right.
We need patience to nurture relationships.
 We have to compromise 
and I'm not patient at all.
Its not only his fault. 
Both of us failed the test of love.
I lost him. I'm telling you he has a connection with Bold.
But don't be afraid, Chotu was telling me they're roaming around the streets.
If I get him this time, I'll beat him up.
He'll speak up and as soon as he does, you'll be out.
What will I get coming out Jojo? 
I'll be all alone in a crowd there too.
I'm alone here as well. I like this place better than the world outside.
What are you saying?
Fariha told me.
When she came here the last time. 
She told me I should be locked up for a few days 
so that I get some sense knocked into me.
People say a lot of things when angry.
She wasn't wrong.
She was right.
 Its my fault.
What life can I give her?
 I thought I was doing her good staying away from her.
But the truth is, I am a coward. 
I was scared that,
before she leaves me, I should leave her.
I created so much distance between us that
 it has become difficult to bridge them.
What will accepting defeat like this get you?
Nobody can win.
I was under the misunderstanding.. a bad impression.
You go. 
I'm fine here.
