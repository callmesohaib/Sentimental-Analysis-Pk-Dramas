even I had said the same thing to Kiran
sometimes, if her husband raises his hand in anger
 then it doesn't mean that he is a bad person
it only means that her bad time is going on 
Yaqoob!
don't be afraid
what?
don't be afraid
stay brave
Yaqoob is waiting, he will go home with Farhad
I hope Farhad comes soon
Sorry to say, he is no more
Yqoob!
yes tell me?
what happened? Will you say something, or keep crying?
Shahzain, dad... 
dad
tell me further, what happened to dad?
my father died
what!
Kiran, don't worry
See, one day or the other everyone has to die
may God forgive him, where are you right now?
In the hospital
Farhad just came
don't know what era is this
means, the child didn't come on time for his father's funeral as well
anyways, don't worry I am coming to the hospital
Ok?
Okay
anyways its good, at least there is no obstacle in my way anymore
now I will see, who is going to save the catering business
about whom you are talking?
Kiran's father
Why? What happened?
he died
and left his catering business for us
really?
we have very less time then
Do quickly whatever you have to do. 
What if Farhad creates any issues for you
after all he is Yaqoob's son
oh mom, don't worry. Even I am very expert in this game
anyways, I am going to the hospital
No no, I will also come along. Let me go & get my purse right away
okay I am waiting outside
yes yes
yes uncle
we will go home from here, as we are in the hospital right now
yes uncle, ok
see you there
bye!
Jojo
look, what happened!
I couldn't make Farhad meet uncle
I couldn't do this as well
why are you blaming yourself?
I wish I could have made Farhad meet uncle once
if you will do like this, then who will handle Farhad?
Farhad needs you right now
come on, wipe your tears
We have to go to the graveyard, as we need the grave besides my grand father's grave. So please check on it
don't take any tension. I am here, I will handle everything
is Farhad inside?
yes
come, lets meet him first then we'll go. Come on
and wipe your face
come in, dear
lets go inside
sit down, dear
Farhad, there is no use of thinking about those words anymore
just pray for his forgiveness, dear
he was so angry with me
he didn't tell me about his health
Angry? With whom he wasn't angry?
Yaqoob was always very furious, dear
I used to tell him at all times, not to take any tension
but my brother... 
died before me
its God's will, dear
everything is due to God's command
All of us should accept God's will
and Farhad, you have to think about the future
Be your mother & sister's strength
try to become their courage
they need you so much
these complaints or grievances.. 
there is no use of keeping them
spend your life happily with your loved ones
I used to explain Yaqoob a lot
but he never used to understand
at least you should understand, my dear
at least you should understand
ok dear, I am going to rest now
you also go rest
have some courage
very good!
we've become an orphan, uncle
don't say this, dear
its God's system
the person who came in this world, had to leave one day
this is the custom, dear
You are my very brave daughter
if you will cry like this then.. 
what about others?
have some courage, my child
do you know
this word "orphan"
is so heavy
I am realizing it today
do you know, how I am feeling?
it feels as if... A very strong, thick & big tree with sturdy base
Has been cut
it has been cut & we are asked to stand in the scorching heat of the sun
this happens in God's system
if today there is happiness, then tomorrow there are sorrows
if today its a sunny day, then tomorrow it will be a cloudy day
I won't ask you to show some courage, dear
don't consider yourself alone
God is great benefactor, my child
I won't ask you not to miss your father's presence
but... whenever you miss your father then remember
Your uncle is alive
he is present to put his hand of kindness on your head, my child
he was telling me to take care of you guys
in fact, he has transferred his catering business on my name
Farhad
Farhad
dad
yes Jojo?
dear, is Farhad asleep?
yes dad, he slept on the terrace
you should have asked him to sleep inside the room
dad, he is sleeping like a powerless & helpless guy. So I didn't find it appropriate to wake him up
anyways.. 
its good
at least he'll rest for a while
my child was so tired
ok dear
dad
yes my child?
dad, after looking at Farhad's condition I've realized that how important parents are
you gave so many sacrifices for us, but I had never said "thanks" to you
oh Jojo, my son.. 
whatever parents do for their children
its their children right
whatever we did for you, is your right my dear. Its your right, my son
but dad, one should say "thanks" for this right & this thanks should be done in this life
otherwise it gets too late
and then its difficult to live with regrets, and you are left with nothing
you are talking about such big things!
have you forgotten? I am the eldest of this house
and I am still alive, my son..
I do such big talks, got it?
hello!
Fareeha?
you've called so late night, is everything fine?
greetings aunt Shaggo..
I'm so sorry to disturb you so late night by calling
No no, are you fine. Is everyone else fine?
aunt...
Farhad's father had passed away
what!
Farhad's father had passed away
*Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return*
what had happened to him, dear?
he had a heart attack
is Farhad fine?
Farhad is in the state of shock
I came home from the hospital, and he went to his house. We didn't talk after that
I was feeling so anxious, that's why I have called you
don't know aunt Shaggo
I am unable to do anything for him in this situation, even if I want to
his family doesn't want to see my face
and his mother is blaming me for this situation
I don't understand, what to do
Fareeha, my dear its all God's work
you don't have any fault in this
don't take this burden on your heart for no reason
sometimes, people talk inappropriate things in grief
don't worry Fareeha, everything will be fine
Shaggo
yes
is Fareeha alone at home?
yes
tell her that we are coming to pick her right away
this will be fine
Fareeha, Hamid is saying that we will come to pick you right away
since you are alone, so it will be appropriate
No aunt, that's not an issue. I am not alone
Aunt Channo, my neighbor. She is with me
She & her husband had supported us a lot in this situation
she is with me
its such a good thing that someone is with you
because if Farhad is with his family, then you should be with your family as well
Okay, then we'll come to pick you in the morning
you can come to us, until Farhad doesn't comes back
I will see, I will see tomorrow what needs to be done
thank you so much!
I've got so much courage by talking to you, I was so worried
my child, you can call me whenever you want to
don't think a bit
I get happy to hear your voice
I'm really as I had disturbed you at this time. I didn't wanted to but.. 
Okay
Ok, bye!
yes, I will call you tomorrow. Bye!
Farhad's family is holding her responsible for it
to Fareeha?
what will happen now?
tomorrow morning we'll go & bring here over here
Ok?
thank you!
hey!
what's the problem?
sit here
sit down
I... 
I've been noticing since a few days that you stay so lost
is everything fine?
I had gone to meet Fareeha
I saw her at Shaggo's wedding
and I heard people talking about her so... 
I couldn't hold myself
even I felt like meeting her
but... 
how is she?
she is fine
she is absolutely fine
without us
she is fine
I had asked her to come back home
I thought.. 
somehow, that I will convince you & Saqib
but.. 
she is still crazy in love
I thought, maybe she is alone
and must be missing us
she must be regretting her decision
she must be thinking that...
when you & I will ask her to come back home
but... 
there isn't any such thing
I have accepted this reality
She is not our daughter now, she has become Farhad's wife
I mean, she is our daughter... 
but... 
what is the use of keeping hope from her? It will hurt us
so.. 
remove her from your heart & don't think about her
how will I solace you, as I myself is heartbroken
I am unable to come out of this shock
dad had visited me a few days ago
he said to me
you are my son
and after me, you have to handle everything
he had considered you his son
why he won't consider him? 
After all, he had filled the presence of his son
he was such a nice man
he always gave me so much of love & respect
he seemed quite worried when he had visited me few days ago
now when I think, it feels... 
as if he got to know what is about to happen
if I had a little idea that he is so unwell, then I would have taken him to the doctor immediately
he was concerned about you all while leaving
what as such he came to say to you?
he was so worried about you all
he was telling me to take care of you guys
in fact, he has transferred his catering business on my name
also he was saying
that its only me, who can handle this responsibility after his demise
dad left so soon
also he had shifted such a big responsibility on my shoulders
how will I fill his presence?
Kareem Baksh & sons is our family business
Yaqoob didn't transferred it on your name
but on Kiran's name
So now, will my daughter-in-law sit at the shop?
how is this possible, sister?
if your son has turned away his face, then it doesn't mean this way
A while ago, you people were so happy with this decision
its such a good thing though
Besides, my everything belongs to Kiran
and dad had set such a good example
that he didn't transferred his business on his son's name but on his daughter's name
he didn't even think about you
maybe he never thought that you are capable of it
and don't you worry, Farhad
Kiran & I will handle everything
as it is, you have to go back to your house
you guys came for the condolence
what discussion you have started?
lets pray for the departed soul
