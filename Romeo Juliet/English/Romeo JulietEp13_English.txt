you are my only son
will you turn away your face from your responsibilities?
Farhad
 you have to take this responsibility
you have to handle the catering business now. Yes! 
Kiran, dad never trusted me
he had announced his decision by transferring this catering business to your name
just because you've got the property so you've got a long tongue now
but I have to teach you a lesson 
I have to teach you a lesson... 
Shahzain
why are you staring now? 
why are you staring!
 I am the owner of this company
and who are you! You don't even worth two bits 
what is your worth?
this is my worth!
Irfan!
go, call the guards
call the police, I will fire him from my company right away
bring water, hurry up!
Sir, please sit
Sir... 
Sir, don't create a spectacle. Everyone has made a video
what if it goes against you?
His father had passed away
Video?
how weird it will look that an ordinary employee is beating his boss
are you getting my point?
who made the video?
Sir, everyone made the video
keep it here
Shaggo
yes
I am looking for you in the entire house & you are here
dear, keep it here & then you may go
I thought to do a bit of setting
even I had thought to do some setting of my house, but I didn't get any time
Its okay, I have done this work of yours
Shaggo.. 
I think, this house was waiting for you
really!
are these cushion covers new?
I don't know, actually there were a few cushions & bed sheets in the big cupboard of the big room
So I have removed the old cushion covers to wash them & did the setting by putting up the new ones
by the way, people say it right
a house needs a woman, which makes it a home
Shaggo
I am so fortunate
better late, but I got you
Hamid
I am also very lucky to get your companionship 
Right now, I am recalling a poem with a lot of intensity
if you allow me, can I say it?
won't you tell me if I will say no?
still I will say it
then tell me
I only have one complaint from my life
Wow!
Please continue
okay.. please continue
I only have one complaint from my life
Wow!
I got you way too late
didn't I tell you correctly?
No no, its good. Very nice!
Hamid, you are very nice
and specially whatever you did for Fariha
for that, I cannot thank you
but still, thank you!
actually I.. 
Shaggo, what happened?
I thought.. 
yesterday, Fariha had visited after so many days
and the ice between father & daughter must have melted
but... 
talking to her is a different matter
brother Yousuf didn't even looked at her
Shaggo, don't worry
everything will be fine between brother Yousuf & Fariha
now see, she came to our house to meet us
also she got to know that aunt Shaggo & Hamid 'uncle'
are with her
uncle!
yes
very nice
So now an aunt's husband will be called as 'uncle', right?
its good, very nice
and I've decided that now I will resolve this matter myself
hmm.. 
this is interference. I was telling you a poetry & you started to discuss Fariha
if you allow me, then can I tell you again?
please continue
I only have one complaint from my life
I think I am not telling you in the right manner
No no, sorry sorry...  please tell me
I only have one complaint from my life... 
now I will tell you the rest tomorrow
No, please wait
no, you continue laughing
it will take some time, such griefs are very heavy
that's why I was saying, you should have called him here. He must have felt a bit okay
I had called him, asked him to come. He said, I am going home & will be back by evening
I said to him, shall I come? 
but he said no
so I became quiet
may God have mercy
and give him courage to tolerate this
hmm... 
nobody can fill the space of a father
Greetings!
I want to meet the gym's owner
Gym's owner?
He is the gym's owner
close your mouth
yes yes, tell me
actually I am a very helpless girl
So, I heard that your gym is co
if you need a lady instructor in your gym for females then
yes, I do need. But no girl comes here
hey! get lost. Do your exercise over there
See, which girl would like to do the exercise with such djinns? Tell me
see, I came here with such high hopes
what to do, hopes are meant to break
you don't know, I am a very poor girl. I need this job desperately
I am telling, none of the girls come here
we have kept such idiots here, look... 
what are you doing?
Excuse me
sir!
have you gone mad?
why?
there might be a possibility that girls don't come to our gym because we don't have a female instructor
girls will also start coming because of her
really, what are you saying?
yes!
she is looking like a model though
but how we will control the boys then?
leave it, everything will be done
We will separate the timings, or put a partition
we'll manage something, everything will be set. Don't take tension
listen!
she looks helpless, so she'll take less salary as well
do one thing
Do partnership of 80-20
80-20... 
you shall see
I've already seen it, its fine. Just come
Look miss... 
Miss Billo
Billo
Okay, you may join
do you plan to die?
No, I've planned to kill
park your bike on the side if you are not well, otherwise you'll die in real
hey Jojo, look!
our gym is blooming a lot because of a woman's presence
I can see that
but I don't find it right
I have to ask Farhad
Get lost! *I have to ask Farhad*
try doing some work on your own sometimes, brother
See, do such a work that Farhad shall feel proud of you
but she is a girl, what she'll do with this gym?
she will wash the clothes!
She will tell them to do the exercise, what else?
you will get some help
yes, you are right
Okay Jojo, so officially I will join the gym from tomorrow
Okay...
its your own gym
whether you join today, tomorrow or day after
or stay over
the gym has brighten up because of your arrival
as if its blooming
right?
really?
alright then, I am leaving now. I will come tomorrow
go, see her off
what?
go, see her off
I shall see her off?
now go!
but why?
what more do I have to teach you!
curse on you!
your game is over now, Jojo
oh... 
hey wait
how will you go back?
I will take a bus
it doesn't look good to go in a bus
Rickshaw! please stop brother
brother, take her home. Here is your money
and be careful, don't speed up
hey no no, there is no need to pay him. I will give him
its ok, please sit
bye!
I am all gone!
Farhad
I am really sorry. As I had gone without informing you
I was having a lot of difficulty over here while staying alone, that's why
But, you should have also called me once
Farhad
I want to be there for you, but at least talk to me
Fariha, they have fired me from my job
Why?
I had misbehaved with my manager
also I have beaten him
why did you do this?
that guy had made my life a living hell, Fariha!
and today, he talked rubbish about my father. That's why I beat him up
Okay
do some rest, I think you need some rest
come
No, I...
everyone is waiting for me at my house, I should go
let me get some clothes
I am leaving then
I..
I won't be needing this office shirt anymore
Fariha, you should have seen the face of that guy
what are you doing!
I have thrashed him very badly
are you fine?
No Fariha
I am not fine
I didn't had any worth in front of my father as well
he always used to think that I can never do anything
I am useless
that's why he died after transferring his catering business on Kiran's name
and her greedy husband, who used to ask for something or the other at each & every minute in the name of dowry
he considered him better than me!
while leaving he said to him, take care of my family after me
because my son isn't capable enough
and my boss!
he used to look at me with disrespect!
because I don't know how to speak English fluently
as I am Urdu speaking
what difference does it make if I am a topper?
it doesn't make any difference
look down!
Farhad
Look here, there isn't any such thing
there isn't any such thing, you are so nice!
why are you with me?
Fariha, why do you love me?
why do you love such a looser guy?
I couldn't keep a job of thirty five thousand rupees only, Fariha
and I don't have any other offer
Fariha, I have nothing!
why are you with me?
Farhad, that's okay
its completely okay, no problem
please go to your aunt's house for a few days
please understand my problem, please Fariha
please go to your aunt's house for a few days
mom won't eat food without me, I have to go there
Okay
I shall leave now
dear, there is nothing to worry
he is in grief, that's why. He will be fine
what if he didn't get fine, then?
I had gone to do a few important work
now I am back
You won't go anywhere, you won't go to your wife.
Promise me, in God's name
promise me that you won't go!
Shaggo
yes
what's the matter, you seem worried
Hamid, I am worried about Fariha & Farhad
why, did something happen?
did Fariha tell something?
Fariha hardly tells anything
actually Farhad's life has experienced such a big accident
and I think, this incident will affect the lives of both of them
the responsibilities are increasing on Farhad
but I think, Farhad is not capable enough to fulfill these responsibilities
what if he...
did injustice with Fariha in all this, then?
what if he leaves Fariha at this point of life, or what if he gets mislead then?
What if their relation had to pay the cost of all this
Hamid...
Shaggo
life is like a teacher
who pats your back with kindness when you do good
but it thrash you off very badly whenever you do bad
every person in this world has to give their exam them self
both of them will fall down, & stand again & it will be continued many times
but I believe that God will never do injustice with them
anyways...
right now you are doing injustice with your ice-cream
now it will start flowing after melting
will you eat your ice-cream, or shall I tell you the poetry?
No no, I am eating the ice-cream
Mom, you always make me understand. Why don't you explain dad sometime?
People have advanced so much & we are still stuck with the old business & house
Saqib, for your father. This house, his family & his business is everything!
but mom, the world has moved too far
here people are expanding their businesses, and the people who doesn't go with the flow remains behind
people are branching-out their business
their fathers are helping them
but here I think dad is after me so that he can stop me for achieving anything more than him
there isn't any such thing
give him some time to understand your point
You started to argue with him about your share of inheritance as soon as you entered the house
what is this way?
mom, I hardly have any time
my family is about to expand & my income is same
family is about to expand?
what do you mean?
I was about to give you the good news
Ramsha is pregnant
what!
such a big good news, Saqib!
And you have started the fuss about your separate business on such a joyous occasion?
so mom, I don't want my upcoming generation to open their eyes in this house
Mom, Ramsha's brother bought a very nice house in Defence
I also want to become successful, I don't want to stay at the same point mom
Saqib
if you'll compete with others
then its a never ending race
then you'll always keep on counting your deficiencies instead of your qualities!
mom, its about every person's perspective
I've set some of my goals, and I will achieve them by any means. That's it!
its my final decision
he has gone, he won't come back
his wife must have called him
aunty, he will come...
you are lying!
you are lying, Jojo. He will never come
aunty, don't worry
I have no one
I don't have anyone
my son left me, also Yaqoob died
Farhad
aunty...
his wife called him, he has gone
he won't come back
what will I do now?
what will I do?
what will I do without him?
eve Kiran is not here
Aunty, he is here. He will come in a while. Don't worry
aunty, he has come
you are lying, Jojo..
aunty look
don't go after leaving me alone, for God sake
you cannot go to your wife, for God sake
I have no one. What will I do?
I had gone to do a few important work
now I am back
You won't go anywhere, you won't go to your wife. Promise me, in God's name
promise me that you won't go!
I've brought my belongings
to live with you
but promise me one thing
yes..
is there more stuff?
yes, but promise me one thing first
yes
will you go to the doctor with me?
will you stay here?
Okay
You won't go anywhere... right?
you won't go anywhere
Greetings aunt Channo, please come
Greetings!
I saw your flat's light, so I came
I thought to check upon yours & Farhad's well-being
He is not here, but I am. Please come in, why are you standing there?
please come, sit
he is not here?
shall I bring something?
Water or so?
No no, please sit
are you worried?
what's the matter?
Channo aunty you had said...
you were absolutely correct that a few incidents in life changes a person
he is not that Farhad
I don't' understand, what is happening
dear, there is nothing to worry
he is in grief, that's why. He will be fine
what if he didn't get fine, then?
I hope he is not thinking that I am responsible for all this
Did Farhad say anything like that?
No, he hasn't said anything, but I have felt it
Right now he is upset with the entire world, including me
dear, there are various dimensions of every person
and with time, you will see them
just don't worry & give him some time. He will be fine
no matter whatever you want to do, but you won't be able to do anything at this time
let him be
Channo aunty, I do understand that his family needs him
but there is a distance which is increasing between us
If I say anything, I will sound 'selfish,' and I don't want to do that.
then tell me, what shall I do?
I can only give you one advice, have patience
every person has their own limit of patience & tolerance
you have to decide the level of your patience, that's it!
I'm sorry, I didn't ask if you wanted tea or anything. Can I bring something for you?
Ok brother, I'll talk to you later as Saqib is here
you also take care. Bye!
what happen, did you talk to her?
yes
what "yes"? Tell me about the entire discussion
today I've learnt how to prepare tamarind & plum juice in summers
what rubbish you are talking?
I had gone to discuss property related matter, so I had discussed it what else
I have talked to her
also I have explained mom, she will make dad understand
and..
and what? tell me the entire story
and I've told mom that God is about to bless us with a baby
why did you tell her?
what do you mean by that? 
After all, she is my mother, won't I tell her?
she was so happy
I don't think so
why are you saying this?
I mean if she had been happy, wouldn't she be blessing me with her prayers?
I am about to give her the first happiness of this house
If there had been another family, they would have made the ground and sky one
Mom is very happy
very happy!
let it be, Saqib
If Fariha had been expecting a baby, then you would have seen
Oh... whose name are you mentioning on such a joyous occasion?
you don't have to worry, I am with you
Ok?
I will do such a celebration that the entire world will see
you'll see
just don't take it to your heart
are you happy?
I've talked about the property, also I have talked to mom. At least be happy now
and listen, make me a cup of tea
you shall serve me
Ok then, let me bring tea for you
Ok sister, I am hanging up now
congratulate brother Yousuf from my side as well
Bye!
Greetings!*
hey!
what happened?
why are you looking at me with a smile?
When a wife looks at her husband in this manner as he comes back home from work, it removes all the tiredness.
sister Rashda had called
really?
yes
actually there is a good news
yes, so you can tell me the good news without suspense
our Saqib...
is about to become a father
Saqib?
Shaggo, you've told me such a big good news. All praise to God!
may God bless them both
Hamid
actually I was thinking that... 
yes, so you were thinking the right thing
what was I thinking?
on such occasions, we should hug our loved ones by forgetting all the differences
Hamid, you've removed my such a big dilemma
Shaggo, what's there about dilemma?
I've only said what is correct. Right?
Its quite late now, so we'll do one thing. 
We'll go tomorrow & give them a surprise
really?
yes
thank you!
you had asked me to bring a few house related things
yes
let me keep them
tell Basharat
Basharat
don't know when he is going to come
hello Kiran!
Farhad, has mom slept?
yes, she did
I made her go to sleep with  a lot of difficulty
I know you must have gone there
I just wanted to discuss something important with you
yes, tell me
Farhad, now it's very important for you to sit in the kitchen (catering business)
Kiran, we had already discussed it
Farhad
Farhad... the matter is that I cannot take this responsibility at this moment. Ok?
Also, I can't trust anyone except for you
right?
talk to Shahzain
at that time he was jumping & telling everyone that he was so close to our dad
now let him do whatever he wants to
Farhad, I don't want our catering business to go in Shahzain's hands
will you tell me the matter clearly?
earlier, you always used to praise Shahzain
if he is so good then trust him
as it is, he can handle it better than me
there is no as such matter, what can be the matter?
he goes to the bank, he hardly have any time
and Farhad, what does he know about this work?
but you know this work, you've spent your entire life in it. Right?
its our father's last memorable, Farhad
our dad's last memorable
dad wanted to keep this business within his family
I don't want anything wrong to happen because of our carelessness
I don't want to loose dad's last memorable, his catering business. Ok?
but Kiran...
Farhad
Farhad
please... Ok?
for me
its very important for you to sit in the kitchen
try to understand my point
for your sister's sake
for your sister, ok?
Ok fine
I will handle the catering business
Kiran
Kiran
Kiran, where are you?
yes
I had been calling you since so long, what were you doing there?
Nothing, just like that
with whom you were talking?
No... with no one
so you are doing these conspiracies!
that's why you couldn't hear me
Shahzain please
why are you testing my patience Kiran? Tell me
Why are you compelling me?
Shahzain!
my hand hurts
then go & tell your brother that what do I want. You won't get hurt then
Kiran look, you know how much I love you
but I love my plans more than that, understand?
and I am afraid, if you take more time in listening to me
then you have to pay much heavier cost, understand?
hold your mobile!
