Hello? Yes Shaboo? Did you find blood?
Did the hospital tell anything?
No Hamid.
Nothing happened here. You people tell me. Whats the update?
We are in front of a blood bank. Fariha has gone to ask inside.
If we can find blood here then okay otherwise we'll go to the Civil blood bank.
Alright.
Hamid, hurry up.
Brother Yousuf might get critical.
You don't have to worry, Shaboo.
God is there. He'll fix everything. Please take care of sister in law.
I've stepped out for her.
To get something for her to eat. Her blood pressure might drop.
Good. Did you tell Zara?
I called and informed. They'll come.
Alright Shaboo. I'll hang up now. Let me go inside and ask.
Fariha is taking very long inside.
Listen,
do one thing. Ask the hospital staff to find a donor. We're searching too.
Alright. I'll talk to someone. May God take care of you.
Bye.
Did the doctor tell anything?
Nothing yet.
How did they arrange blood?
I think the hospital people did it.
He is out of danger now. We were able to control the bleeding. He's stable now.
And thank God, we were able to find blood on time.
Can we meet him?
No. He's resting right now. The nurse will update you.
Thank you doctor.
Thank God.
I was so scared.
Me too.
But don't worry. We will not let anything happen to your dad, so easily.
We'll always be thankful to that blood donor. Can we find out who he was?
We should personally thank him.
Saqib, what happened? Whats the situation at the shop?
And did you find something in the footage?
No. Nothing yet.
We'll have proper investigations done, Saqib. And we'll definitely punish whoever is involved.
You don't have to worry. I'll fix everything.
Should I get water for you?
You sit here. Shaboo has gone. She'll bring it.
What is it? You seem very happy? Did you win a lottery?
Mom, I won a lottery long ago.
Now I'll have to cash it.
Why are you throwing riddles? Tell me what happened.
The fish is about to take the bite. I've played a nice move, lets see where it goes.
You never listen to me.
I've been telling you, someone has been teaching her. Even when you told her, she's still at her parents' house.
Mom, whether someone teaches her anything,
I know when to pull her strings. You just wait and watch.
What is it? Has she agreed to come back? Are you going to bring her back?
Think of it as so. She'll be here with you in this house in a few days.
You and your riddles. Where are you going right now?
I'm going for dinner with my friends from the bank right now.
You know I've been traumatized since so many days but now I'm at peace.
You brought this trauma onto yourself.
I've been telling you to rid of her.
Mom, I'm getting late. We'll talk when I get back. And I said, I'm not letting her go. End of story.
Alright. Do whatever you want to do. But tell your wife, don't expect good from me.
Alright.
Hello?
Yes. I'm coming. We have many more problems in life. I'm coming. Okay.
Hello mom..
How is my child?
I'm fine. How are you?
What happened to you?
Nothing happened.
I'm going to go rest for a while.
Yes mom. You should.
Its amazing. Mom said she wants to go back next week.
Really?
Yes.
She must be a good doctor.
We should also go, Kiran.
We have also suffered traumas.
What?
Trauma..
Trauma?
You're reading books about psychotherapy?
No. I read about it in a magazine.
They had written a lot about victims of domestic abuse.
You should go.
Did you read anything about anger management?
I did. There were a few things there.
I'm controlling. I'm managing.
Otherwise I would have been like Shahzain.
Of course. First in the hospital, then in jail.
I didn't do anything. I'm controlling.
By the way.. will Shahzain agree for the divorce?
What difference does it make? You have a right to divorce too.
No. I was just thinking he'll not let me go so easily.
If you say, I'll go and..
What?
Nothing. I was just saying that I might..
Don't worry. If he makes a mess, we'll go to a good lawyer.
We have options other than violence.
Now my sister.. can you get me a good cup of tea?
Make it yourself.
Everybody is taking advantage of me.
I donated blood today.
Yes alright. I'll make it myself. Don't ask me for anything now.
Excuse me, he's awake and out of danger now.
Thank God.
Can we meet him now?
He's calling Fariha again and again.
And who is Saqib? He's calling him as well.
This is Saqib.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
What is the problem?
The problem is that you're in the hospital.
All of us were so scared, dad.
Nothing will happen to your father, dear.
Dad.. how are you feeling now?
I'm doing good.
My entire family is together, what else do I need?
I need my children together. I don't trust life.
I've already wasted a lot of time. I don't want to waste any more time.
You guys can fight as much as you want and then be done with it please.
And whatever little time is left with me, I want to spend with my children and grand children.
No dear.. I don't want anything. You can do anything with the shop.
It won't make a difference to me. But one thing, can I have my family back?
Please stop..
I'm sorry.
Please get some rest.
Hamid uncle, you went through so much trouble. My husband was coming to pick me up.
Dear, whats the trouble in it?
Your husband has been coming back and forth since morning.
I'll go home and offer prayers of gratitude. My brother Yousuf and his family..
they are all together now.
Thank God aunt. I cannot tell you how happy I am watching this.
God brings ease after every difficulty.
We should be offering prayers of gratitude for brother Yousuf's health as well.
Otherwise we were so scared.
How did so much happen? Uncle doesn't have any enmity with anyone.
And he is such a patient man.
I feel this has more than just enmity to it. But for now..
this isn't the right moment to talk about it. I'll take an update myself, later on.
This is a worrying situation. If people can do it once, they can do it again.
No Shabbo, don't worry.
Once we complain in the police, how will someone dare attack him again?
But Hamid uncle, you should be careful about everything you do. Such people are very dangerous.
Zara dear, we shouldn't bow down to atrocities. You people just pray that Saqib,
clears his heart for Fariha.
You're right about it.
Otherwise, there will be a lot of problems.
By the way, I don't think,
Saqib will say anything else. He is already so upset because of uncle.
I pray to God for this.
Your father..
Your father wasn't a bad man.
Its just that he would get very angry.
Sometimes he would do bad things.
He realized everything. His conscience was burdened.
Before he died, he apologized to me.
I forgave him. You should also forgive him.
Those who die are dead.
Whoever is left behind, is burdened with their memories.
That's why we should just let all grudges go with the dead person.
I've seen a lot of pain in my life.
I took everybody's burden on my shoulders.
I never realized Farhad that I put my own burden on my kids.
I did whatever others told me.
I spent my life fulfilling expectations.
I didn't want my children to live life like this.
I want to free my children from the burden of their parents.
Life is very colorful. I never allowed,
my life could also have been colorful.
I surrounded myself with darkness and depression became my identity.
I..
Whatever you did..
I was jealous of you.
You wrote your own story.
Thats why I couldn't accept it. Whatever you did..
Neither Yaqoob nor me.. we didn't have the courage or the sensibility.
I don't want you people to surround your lives with my darkness.
If one generation is uneducated, the other generation blindly follows it as tradition.
You have to break this tradition.
I couldn't be a happy mother to you people.
It was my mistake but I want to change now. I want to fix my mistakes.
Will you be able to forgive your mother?
Mom.. I'm very guilty.
I want to meet Kiran.
She doesn't want to meet you. Go away.
Nobody can stop me from meeting my wife. Kiran?
Kiran, come outside. Kiran! Lets go home. I'm here to take you back.
You said we'd give this marriage another chance. See, I'm here now.
Mom.. make her understand. A marriage isn't a joke.
I cannot divorce her for such a small thing. We have to nurture relationships.
What are you here for?
I'm talking to my wife.
She doesn't want to talk to you. Get lost.
She has decided to come home.
Are you out of your mind?
If you don't believe me, ask her.
You cannot make your marriage work. You must be jealous.
Now you want us divorced.
And as it is, I cannot compare your disrespectful relationship with my respectful relationship.
Shut up, Shahzain. Before I do something.
You cannot dare now. Kiran will decide now.
Kiran see.. no relationship is perfect. You have to make it perfect.
I cannot divorce you for such a small thing.
And as it is,
this is an unfavorable act in the sight of God.
Mom, make her understand. Elders have a duty.
If dad was alive, would he want his dear daughter to be divorced?
Kiran please.. forgive me.
You say something please.
I want to hit you with something.
Be cool. This is Kiran's decision.
Yes. The real decision will be Kiran's.
Did it hurt? Did it hurt?
Its nothing in front of the pain that you gave me, repeatedly. But its alright.
Its alright Shahzain. Tell me right now, Kiran, it doesn't make a difference.
Its just a slap and it doesn't affect our relationship. I'll come with you right now.
But no.
Tell me. You're preparing to take your revenge, right?
One slap Shahzain..
One slap and you're shivering with wrath.
Its not the pain that you feel on the outside.. the soul shatters.
Are you out of your mind Kiran?
Not at all. I was stupid earlier.
I was stupid that I used to believe that whatever happened repeatedly was my fault.
Shahzain is upset.. You must have done something Kiran that he had to slap you.
He would hit you because its your fault.. you bad luck.. I kept torturing myself telling this.
My mind became paralyzed thinking what would people say. Do you know Shahzain?
People.. these people.. these are the people who care whether I'm dead or alive.
They worry for me. They are my people and they are standing with me.
And we'll be here forever.
Mom.. can you see? If nothing else..
dad's dead soul will be in so much pain that his daughter is a divorcee.
I will accept a divorced daughter but not a dead one.
Shahzain..
After today, not a single scratch will affect the daughter of Yaqoob Kareem Baksh.
As soon as she rids of a devil like you.. her father's soul will be at peace.
All of you will regret it. All of you... Kiran..
Get lost.
Didn't I tell you he was the wrong man?
Dear, you should have given him another slap.
Should I get something for you?
No dear. I'm fine.
Dad, are you feeling better now?
Much better dear. Now..
Watching my family together, I feel very happy.
And, now everything will be alright.
Of course.
Thank God that you're alive. Did you find out who did everything?
Its strange that nothing was taken from the shop.
It seems they were there for something else.
Find out who was behind it.
You don't have to worry about anything. You just rest.
You have to rest inside
No. Sit with me. I like it.
I knew you'd listen to your family. Fariha is back.
See..
This isn't the time for all this. Dad came back from the hospital.
Dad found the right opportunity to make you listen to him.
Its not like that.
Then what is it? 
Don't you remember how she insulted us before she left?
You all said that the doors of the house were shut for her and she'd never come back 
but she just cried and everything was okay.
Dad was waiting for his beloved daughter to come back.
But you should be ashamed.
Do you even know what you're talking about? My dad fought a battle between life and dead.
Is this the time to talk?
Every time something happens and I have to sacrifice.
Tell me.. Will we go to our own house? Will you do this for me and your child?
I know, you wouldn't dare. Never. You cannot speak in front of your father.
You'll keep hiding in his shadows.
Yes I'll hide in his shadow. 
Thats best for me.
I cannot decide the right thing. I don't know people, what should I say.
Whatever happened with dad was because of me.
Because of you?
I was after dad's life to sell the shop because I thought this was good for our future. 
But I didn't know the man I wanted to sell the shop to, would be like this..
They were thieves.
Dad said no to selling the shop and he did all this to teach dad a lesson.
All my life, 
I stayed confined in my community. All relationships, all friendships and every deal I made in my community.
I thought our community would support each other
 but I didn't know Botalwala would do this to dad..
Good and bad people are everywhere 
but our community is our community. What is more important than that?
One thing is important. 
Humanity.
You are blaming yourself without a reason. 
You didn't know he'd do this. Its not your fault.
I made a big mistake. 
Its time to fix those mistakes.
If I don't do it for myself, I'll do it for my future generations.
I'll have to change everything.
Mom.. 
I know that you must be thinking..
what would I do without a husband after my divorce?
But mom.. Its best to be alone rather than an abusive relationship.
Kiran, whatever you did today..
I'm proud of you. 
You showed courage.
I never thought my daughter was so powerful. 
I always taught you whatever I was taught.
Husbands are Gods on earth.
 We will only leave their house after our death.
If a husband hits you when he's angry, you should tolerate because we have to tolerate everything.
Hide your husband's fault and don't talk to anyone. Don't imagine living without your husband.
I was my parents' only child. If only they had embraced me once,
and made me believe that I wasn't a burden on them. Maybe..
I would have been courageous to fight for my rights. My story would be different.
Nobody opened such a door for me. But I want,
that you should decide for your life without any fear.
That old tradition is finished with me.
Its not that I'm not afraid for your future.
But whatever happens, we'll watch it together.
I feel ashamed when I look at you.
I was never a happy mother. I was always upset.
My responsibility was to look after my children's pains.
But Kiran, you have looked after me, all my life.
 If only you didn't have such a weak mother.
Mom.. whatever you did for me today, I'll never forget it all my life.
This thought school and old traditions that we revere,
its not cowardice to break these chains for your children. Its courage. And my mother..
My mother isn't weak.
 She's courageous.
Everything will be alright. I'll be your strength.
Everything will be alright.
