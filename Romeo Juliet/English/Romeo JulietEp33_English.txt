I need malpura (sweet pancake) in dessert 
what?
Malpura?
don't you know about it?
Sir, you can pay whatever is easy for you
 its no problem even if you don't pay
and I found Ms. Freeha quite wise 
there is no question of making her a fool
how do you know Freeha? 
I haven't said anything wrong 
but you've talked in a wrong manner!
you cannot apologize... 
but you do want your sister's engagement to be called off due to your ego, right?
hurry up, the catering guys are here 
so, what's there to worry about? 
the matter is worrisome, because they met brother Saqib
brother Saqib?
yes!
lets go!
Sir, don't take any tension. You won't have any sort of complaint
what happened to you?
Nothing!
correct the bill then send me
wait here, & keep an eye on them
ok, brother Saqib
what happen, are you feeling constipated?
don't talk rubbish!
move, brother Saqib's boot-licker!
to whom you are calling with this name?
you bald person, I've said to you whom else?
are you guys done?
Maqsood, go inside & tell everyone that event planners are here to check the area
brother Saqib had asked me to keep an eye on both of them
Fine, you can keep an eye on them later. But first go & inform everyone. Go!
No
you'll understand once I'll give you a tight slap. Go!
Okay, but you guys shall remember one thing. I have my eyes on you!
understand?
hi!
I hope brother Saqib haven't said anything inappropriate to you guys
No no, not at all!
he was asking about discount, I said it will be done. No problem
he was ready to do the event free of cost as well
No no! why free of cost? Not at all
I hope you haven't said anything about the accident
which accident?
nothing
No no... 
why you're wearing such a bright red color shirt in the scorching heat?
it feels as if he is burning in hell fire
Billu!
its very nice
let me show you the area
Sure
I had told you, its a rubbish idea
but she said "very nice"
leave it!
confidence... confidence!
shall we?
yes yes
you've made a gym at your house?
Nice, let me train you here
oh bro, I am not in a mood. You know.. 
one needs to make up their mood, you have a wedding in your house. How come you stay so chubby!
lets make your abs, come on
try to understand
are you his cousin?
He is my brother
oh so you are his sister! So, he would be needing your moral support by saying "one more time". Come on
yes, that's fine
you guys may go
your house is very beautiful
thank you! this is my world's favorite place
no matter wherever I go, I miss my house so much after a week's time
my world becomes tasteless infront of its affection
really?
you are so lucky
why? Don't you like your house?
neither I like it, nor I dislike it
it just seems desolate
is your family small?
No no, the family is quite big but.. 
but there is loneliness in the crowd as well, right?
I know what you mean. I know
even my family is very big, but everyone is so close
and they are into everyone's personal space so much, that sometimes I feel so suffocated
then I leave my house & hide here, at the rooftop
sit down
what else do you do?
I listen to songs
I talk to myself a lot
and the sunset view is really beautiful here, I enjoy that too
I do deep breathing, and calm myself down
and then go back to my family once again
and you get relax by doing all this?
yes
I must say, you shall try this once
if it didn't work, then I'll return your money
I have to return the money though... 
your brother didn't like my quotation
I'm so sorry, don't mind his words
by the way, your brother seems quite strict
he is
are you afraid?
No... 
why would I be afraid?
I am... 
I'm
fine?
Okay, put this discussion aside
this is your canvas
you have to decorate it
and remember one thing, Zara is not only my cousin but my sister
in fact, she is my most favorite person in this world
this evening should be memorable for her, in fact it should be special
it will be, I promise!
then?
then what?
from where this noise is coming?
nothing happened
what have you done with him?
his muscle got pulled, let me fix it right away
ouch! 
I had told you not to make him do such exercises
I thought, he'll be able to do it
Billu!
hey, what are you doing?
it was just bench press
what was the need to make him do such kind of exercise?
I thought, he'll be able to do it
lets go! get up & don't do it again
come with me
don't know which 6 packs fashion is trending nowadays! You look good however you are
don't get into all such useless things next time
let me give them the pain killer
quickly go! 
don't take tension, they'll manage
small injuries do happen in such cases
please come
here... 
we'll put the fairy lights here, from above
you couldn't decide that what kind of a function shall be done, right?
it will look as if there are stars in the sky at night time
I didn't thought that it will be possible
but nice
you've said the words of my heart
I will always keep doing
I mean, I will keep fulfilling all of your requests
after all, its my work
you talk so much!
not with everyone
hmm... everyone says the same thing
everyone?
whom else you've injured from your bike?
hey! only one
it means, I am special?
shall we talk about work?
look at the garden
its uneven from some places, & there are small holes in between
So be careful, what if any accident happens
hey! red shirt guy
what is happening here? Who are you?
aunt Shaggo, I had told you that catering guys had to come. So they are here
So, put the tents. Instead you guys are doing a cheap scene
actually I slipped, so he had helped me
hmm... as if you were falling from the 8th floor
no aunty, actually... 
move back... 
I need you on one arm distance
he is flirting in the full day light. Oh God save us, look at his shirt
aunty please... 
couldn't you find any other catering guy?
Don't you dare to make him do the exercise ever again!
I shall not see you again
what's happening here?
lets go, our work is done
lets go, come
this item is also with him?
I think we should leave now, right?
bye!
bye!
Sorry man, how would I know that he'll become unstable in the warm up?
besides, his sister scolds a lot
what's my mistake, why are you angry at me?
sit down
couldn't you find anyone else?
let me call Memon Kebab House right away, they'll do such an amazing arrangement
but get rid of them
aunt Shaggo please, let me handle it
as if you'll be able to handle
Kiran
Kiran
yes dad
I wanted to talk to you
yes
I had a word with Shahzain's father
Okay, all good?
I agree, that day Farhad's way of talking was wrong
but he wasn't wrong
even I was quite worried about the same thing since so long
so I had talked to him clearly as well
they said, now they won't talk about any dowry or so. And the wedding date is fixed for this month
really? Are you telling the truth?
do we joke with each other?
No, we don't
its such a good thing then
now quickly go & bring me a cup of tea
let me prepare a best cup of tea for you
where is the remote?
its there, on the sofa
on which sofa?
let watch this
what's the matter?
I should be asking this from you
why are you talking so weird?
look here
yes
now I've understood that why are you so excited about this function
hey look... 
if this function is disliked by everyone then I must say, lets cancel it
Fine! so I am canceling this function
why are you agreeing with me?
who am I? Its not my wedding but yours
why will you cancel the function? 
It shouldn't be canceled at all!
then tell me honestly, what's going on between you & that guy?
I know its not only catering matter, you know him prior right?
why are you doing so many questions from me?
I haven't done anything wrong. It feels as if I am being questioned for no reason
because I feel as if you are hiding something from me
if I will tell you, then swear upon my life that you won't tell anything to anyone
I know a lot of your weird stuff, have I ever said anything to anyone that I will tell this?
tell me
Okay... do you remember, we had gone to the tailor master that day to pick up your dress 
we had an accident over there
the poor guy had reached to the hospital
it was about to become a police case
oh my God! police case?
yes, but the guy is naive that's why he didn't said anything
I had gone to him to apologize
then?
then everything went well
then I got to know that he has a catering business
I thought, my work will be done
I was feeling so guilty & at that time he was in quite a lot of pain
but Freeha, what if anyone gets to know about it then?
why anyone will get to know?
Crazy girl! people run away after doing robbery
and you've called him back to our house
this case will be opened once again
No! nothing as such will happen. He is such a nice person
Freeha, I hope you don't have any other plans in your mind with that guy
No... not at all! Are you mad?
no no.. 
by the way, he is very cute
get back to your senses, Freeha
don't ever imagine any such kind of dream even by mistake
this is Moti Palace
people don't fall in love over here
here, people make the matches on the ground 
and that too in the same community
so, it would be better for you to come back to the ground
Fine! I know.. 
he is good looking guy
Can't I even appreciate?
Fine, then put a blindfold on my eyes
don't just put a blindfold on your brains!
got it?
oho, a lot of work is still left
what have you done to yourself?
its a wedding house & there is plenty of work to do
I had told you to do some exercises at home & keep your mouth shut
only then you'll loose weight
Weird, don't know what madness is this
he'll do the exercise! Now your muscles are pulled
I'll be fine, as it is small injuries do happen to athletes
hmm... very big athlete.
get up & call everyone for dinner
I?
yes, you. Come on get up, hurry up!
do you know, its my daughter's wedding
I have gathered it for her
it might not be of lacs but...
I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
if you also have a daughter
then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
I think...
there is nobody in this world except for you
hello!
yesterday, I saw you sitting on the bench
maybe you had forgotten your notebook
you took my notebook!
No, I tried searching for you but I couldn't find you.
 So, I had kept it with me for the safety
where is my notebook?
its lying in my car. As I can't do the jogging while holding it
Come with me. Its lying in the car, let me give it to you
I understand all!
what?
yes...
What?
what is this?
Can't a girl walk on the track all alone?
I know everything! 
You want me to sit in your car by making an excuse
you are taking me wrong. What are you saying?
what I am saying? let me tell you
You are flirting with me while considering me alone
I will make noise if you try to become free with me
you are already making noise, I haven't made any
please come, its lying in the car.
Ouch!
do you have water?
is this water?
that man was trying to do flirt with me, but I have sprayed a pepper pray on him
go check on him, hurry up!
don't you worry, let me go & check
Ok
next time he'll think ten times before flirting with any girl
the women of that house are dangerous, the kids are dangerous... 
and their men are more dangerous!
what are you doing?
I'm waking you up!
brother, they are such a dangerous family
Don't do this! 
I swear upon God. Until I was inside their house, I thought I will never be able to come outside
oh brother, her cousin has scolded me so much in those 5 minutes that even my parents haven't scolded me that much in my entire life 
I'm sorry to say, but I didn't find sister-in-law's behavior right as well
I already had a doubt
and her brother, the mustache guy! Did you see him?
the actual terror is of him
are you even listening to me?
hello!
Mister!
oh brother, are you listening to me?
hello!
you'll only do the same thing for which I will stop you
right?
oh brother... 
your brother is gone now!
what is all this?
I had been gathering a few things for Kiran from sometime
I can't believe that day is here
may God bless my daughter with a really good fate
even I have gathered some gold. So, I am thinking to go tomorrow & get its jewelry made
and it will be good to go in the wedding
it will be good
my friend has given me an address of a jeweler
I am going to visit his shop
Okay
Greetings!
how are you?
All thanks to God!
show me this set
its so beautiful, what's its price?
its of 20 lacs.
So expensive!
yes uncle, look at the gold's price. Its sky rocketing nowadays
yes, true that
I have some jewelry, kindly tell me its cost first then I will see something
Ok, let me check
bring my spectacles...
you!
you?
what are you doing here?
its my shop! Who allowed him to enter?
is your photograph pasted outside that we'll get to know that its your shop?
if I had known that its the shop of an arrogant man like you, then I would have never entered
We don't keep such kind of jewelry
so its better for you to leave with your leftover respect
such an arrogance is not good
you might be a rich guy
you might have abundant wealth
but don't forget that we are also respectable people
haven't you forgotten humanity while weighing gold?
do you know, its my daughter's wedding
I have gathered it for her
it might not be of lacs but... 
I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
if you also have a daughter
then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
be quiet & don't try to give me lecture
I know what kind of a person you are!
now don't waste our time & get out
He shall not come to our shop again, oust him
bring my spectacles
think about it! Why are you taking me to the don's house?
you can come if you want to but don't eat my brain
sit down
where are you guys going after getting so dressed-up?
dad, we are going on a function
I had mixed the rice cauldron, Shamshad will deliver them
No, actually we have to look after a few more arrangements too. The lights etc.. 
but we don't do that
dad, the client had specially requested
So, we thought to check it ourselves
and you didn't bothered asking me!
dad, since it was a small work so we didn't think of bothering you
besides, it was my first function so I thought to look after it myself
uncle, relax! The boy will handle, he is grown up!
As it is, he has to handle the kitchen in the future too. Right?
everything should be done perfectly. Our kitchen's name shouldn't be ruined
yes dad, don't you worry
it would be ruined if we would have taken your kitchen's name
what?
No, nothing!
dad, you shall rest. We are leaving. Ok?
Bye!
such a high sense of hearing, man!
hey you!
what is this? Fix it
I'm telling you, there shouldn't be any issue
brother, here comes your musical instrument
oh wow!
listen! have you arranged the cutlery?
but I haven't brought the knife
I'm telling you I will kill you! They don't eat rice & lentils with their hands like we do
Ok fine, let me arrange it. I'm just coming in 2 minutes
hey man, come here. Hold it
keep it properly over here, and please do the work
Shamshad
yes
will the cauldrons be delivered on time?
yes, they will
what about Malpura (dessert)?
that too
good!
Listen, if the dinner won't be piping hot then I will set you straight
as I said, the food will be delivered!
what is wrong with these lights?
Every work needs to be done here our self!
nobody wants to do the proper work, all are slackers!
everything is perfect!
really!
everything is perfect!
then?
then what?
oh wow....
its such a nice function, right?
Wow... lets go everyone
lets go...
hey! no elders allowed in the children party
only Shaggo aunt is allowed
but what about us?
ok fine! If you want to come then you need to pay the tax
pay the tax
alright then, let us pay the tax
you are memon child, wait... let me give you the tax
Okay ok, thank you!
hey hey!
thank you!
hey my dear child, stay blessed
welcome!
lets go now, come on sing the songs
please sit
hey brother Hamid, I am coming
Farhad
what's the matter?
Jojo was telling me that its an urgent matter
is everything fine?
I hope there isn't any issue of Malpura (dessert) otherwise, my family will kill me!
SShh.... 
be quiet
I've gathered the courage with a lot of difficulty
maybe, I won't be able to say it again
Freeha
I... 
I have fallen in love with you
I don't know what happens to me after seeing you
It feels... 
there is nobody in this world except for you
maybe I've become crazy but... 
seriously.. 
I love you!
brother Saqib!
