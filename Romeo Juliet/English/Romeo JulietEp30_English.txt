How many kgs?
 5 kgs
like this, now give it a jerk. Come on this way!
got it? 
got it? 
yes!
see, just give me one chance 
just give me one chance, I am still the same Farhad... 
No, you are not that Farhad. And whoever this Farhad is, I don't want to know him
this is my decision
 its over!
Shaggo! 
yes sister? 
a guy is coming to see Freeha guy! 
a guy is coming! 
When?
right now
right now!
Ask her to get ready & come downstairs, the guests are here
sister, how can we present her in front of anyone just like that
you know Freeha's nature very well. She'll get upset
let her be
if we will tell her then she'll vanish somewhere by making an excuse
sister..
and yes! don't brain wash her about anything
sister, why will I brain wash her?
I was just saying this so that she doesn't make any spectacle in front of the guests
that's why I am saying, there is no need to tell her anything
get her ready & bring her downstairs. Rest I will handle
Ok
did you see? She always talk about creating obstacles
Freeha
Freeha...
they are calling you downstairs
the guests are here, go meet them
who is it? I don't want to meet anyone right now
I don't know. Go, ask your mom
aunt Shaggo, your Gujarti mode is on. Means something is fishy
I don't get it, what's the problem?
as I said, go ask your mom
She had just asked me to bring you downstairs
I will be thankful to you, if you can please go downstairs
do you get it now?
Okay, chill!
what have you done to your room?
aunt Shaggo, I am not liking this vibe
you'll get to know about the vibes
it will be a total disaster!
isn't your husband home?
actually...
Greetings!
Greetings! How are you?
fine?
dear, come sit
All praise to God, she has become all grown up & pretty
Last, I saw her in her childhood
yes
dear, serve tea to aunt & Sarmad
lets call someone from inside to serve the tea
hey, why will the servants do this?
in our family, all house chores are done by the women
great!
call dad
actually he is not at home
he was so upset that he won't be able to reach on time
also he had said that he wants the complete report
she is habitual of joking, our house is always lively because of her
yes, daughters are the liveliness of one's house
please take something.
Freeha, serve her the tea
hey no, Sarmad doesn't drink tea. These kids love coffee
Freeha knows how to prepare a very nice coffee, she'll bring it right away
I was thinking, what if the children shall go for some coffee nearby
this way they'll be able to have some conversation
but...
it won't be appropriate
mom, we know Sarmad & his family since so long. She'll be back within half an hour
the time has changed
all of this has become quite necessary nowadays
Besides, we don't want to give anyone a chance to complaint
yes yes, even we aren't that old school
You guys are our family, if we won't trust you then on whom else we will?
true that
after all, these children have to make the final decision
yes yes, you are right
Freeha go
go, you just have to go nearby. You'll be back within half an hour
please come
come...
please do visit our home
are you set now?
not at all, brother
I've done everything, played carom & Foosball too
also I drank 5 cups of tea
but nothing is effecting
my heart is still upset, brother
at least you are trying, we are trying it together
everything will be alright, brother. It happens slowly & gradually
its a heart matter, so it will take some time
but you are in such a hurry
we don't have a magic wand, that once we use it & it will create a magic and everything will be fixed
it will take some time. Now look at me, even my girl had dumped me
now see, I am enjoying my life & everything is set
you think too much, that's your only problem
anyways, leave all this. Go straight, let me treat with a great dessert. Come
come on my brother, go straight
where are you going?
where are you turning? Oh hello! we have to go straight
Farhad!
how will you move on if you'll do like this?
I don't want to move on!
she must be upset too
I just wanted to see her once
poor girl must have been in a bad condition while crying continuously
but she seems quite fit!
lets go, come on
what are you doing!
is the AC fine?
yes, its fine
let me play some music
actually, dad had recently gifted me this car as a birthday gift. So I am still figuring it out
No, that's ok. Its fine without music
really?
Okay... as you wish
maybe he is her cousin brother
give me a balloon
cousin brother, right?
maybe he likes balloons
for you
thank you!
somebody shall learn from her, how to move on!
by the way, the guy seems classy
but my brother has a separate class
lets go, what's the use of it? 
Lets go
come on
hey brother! Where are you going?
I want to talk to her
are you mad! What will you say to her?
I don't know, but I want to talk to her
brother, you are not in your senses the matter will be ruined
forget her!
is the matter under control now?
Farhad!
this Rolex feels quite heavy sometimes
it hurts the wrist
what would you like to drink?
cappuccino or latte?
I don't like coffee, but you may order whichever you like
oh really? I love coffee
I have placed a machine in my house as well
then you should have drank it at home, what was the need to waste your money here?
You have a good sense of humor
I can't see the waiter
I think, you need to place an order over there
in that case, let me order my choice of coffee for you
you wouldn't have tasted such a coffee ever, I am sure you'll change your mind
I can take my own decision
relax! Its just coffee
Farhad! you here?
you are doing an absolutely correct thing
I don't know why I came here
maybe...
I came to tell you that
he is hundred percent better than me
you are doing the right thing
who are you? Why are you getting free with her?
I see, by seeing an alone girl you are trying to do flirt with her
look at his attire...
they let so cheap people enter here
hey! get lost from here else I will break your jaw!
hey!
how dare you to raise your hand on him?
and what do you think of yourself!
is this some way to behave with someone?
how dare you!
do you know him?
you have insulted me for such a lowly guy!
let me tell you...
hey you! don't even think of it
else, I will bury you right away
you don't know me yet, I will see you later
you don't know me!
he forgot his belongings here, let me go give him
what was this for?
because you deserve it!
lets go now!
but where?
to drop me home, where else?
Farhad, stop the bike
what?
I said, stop the bike
Farhad, I said stop the bike
stop it
but what happened?
Freeha?
Freeha, where are you going?
Freeha?
Freeha, where are you going?
at least listen to me. Freeha.
Freeha?
what's your problem?
what?
what is your problem? You have made me go crazy!
I don't know how to speak in Gujrati language
but you've made me so crazy that I don't know how am I am speaking it
everything is getting upside down since you've come
what do you think of yourself, tell me!
I completely hate it when others make my life's decisions
who gave you the right?
you thought it yourself that I will love some cheap, showoff Rolex guy & I cannot love some caterer?
you've thought it yourself! 
Who are you to decide it?
Freeha, I was just...
Shut up! Quiet
only I have the right to make my life's decisions, got it?
so whom do you love?
I love you, you idiot!
I love you, Farhad!
shall we lock it then?
not over? Ok?
what if you'll lie to me again then?
I know what you can do
next time, I won't create any trouble. Promise!
sorry!
Fine, then quickly take me home
as of yet the matter would have spread on the Memon hot line that Freeha Motivala has slapped someone
Wow, Motivala!
by the way, do you know I had never thought that I will be flattered by a girl's slap
Great!
lets go home
So then?
so what?
aunty.. 
yes?
did you get today's arrangement done from the same guys, who had arranged the dance party?
No, what's wrong? Do I have to ruin my daughter's wedding?
I will not come in this every time
brother Saqib I... 
Quiet!
not a single word!
why you guys had sent me with such kind of a guy?
do you know, he was such a violent & ill-mannered guy
I was so afraid
you got afraid?
but his mother said that you had misbehaved, you had slapped him
so, didn't she tell you that why I had slapped him?
you must have misbehaved with him for sure
Fine! You can say that to me. But I must say, call him & ask
that why I had slapped him, and what was he doing there
He started beating everyone like a hooligan
I met a friend, & he just causally said "hi"
he started coming towards me after beating & fighting with everyone
I was so scared, dad
what! 
yes
I was so scared
was this your choice for me?
but they were saying something else
obviously dad, they'll accuse the girl
dad, I was so scared. Also I never wanted to go with him, but all of them had forced me
we know them since so long
a person doesn't carry a character certificate with themselves
what was the need? They should have called us home & refused
dad, they were insisting a lot so we thought...
what you had thought?
I had told you that they'll meet at the wedding
and everything will be fixed there & then
then why you did this?
brother, sister thought of giving her some choices
as she is so picky
apparently they seem to be good people
how we would have known that..
whatever, next time it shouldn't happen. Got it?
go my dear
lets go Freeha, its enough for today. Come on
I knew it already, that it will be a total disaster
wow! it smells so good
yes...
what are you cooking?
my Kiran's favorite, Korma (chicken curry)
she is coming
oh, Kiran is coming over? Great!
do you know, I haven't met her since so long
she has vanished since she got married
she doesn't even answer my messages properly
let her come, I will fix her
No, there is no need to
now that's her house & her family
let your sister settle down
what do you mean? 
has she broken off her ties with us?
No... she didn't but it has changed now
Farhad, what do you do!
what?
You have magic in your hands, wow!
you've made such a nice rice pudding
that's true, but why my son is so happy?
isn't that matter true? that girl related
what?
actually... 
Kiran is here
let me open the door
Farhad
Can you try not to argue with your father today?
don't argue, Kiran will be worried
my condition always get bad whenever I see you both arguing
can you please try for you mom?
promise?
yes yes, promise
yes Greeting! To whom do you want to meet?
don't talk rubbish!
forgive us, we don't have money
Farhad...
Okay, so you remember my name. I thought you don't remember my name
I agree that you're married now, but do I have any relation with you or not?
I was quite busy, that's it!
yes yes...
 Greetings Shahzain! How are you?
I will pick you in the evening
see you, bye!
bye!
what happened to him?
nothing, brother.. 
Kiran, is everything fine?
he is upset with you
with me? Why!
upon that video matter, he saw that video
is he a kid?
I mean, such things do happen between the guys. He should get over with it
Farhad, Shahzain is correct
just imagine, how insulting it must be for him that even his cousins saw the video
oh, then he shall talk to me. Won't he speak to me for life time?
and we'll keep fighting like this forever?
listen to me Farhad, at least you shouldn't retaliate. Ok?
in fact, don't answer back to Shahzain for anything. Also, I must say... 
don't come infront of him until he forgets everything
I mean, I don't want any problem to happen
Kiran
is everything fine?
I hope he doesn't takes out my anger on you
obviously! there isn't any such thing, Farhad
I am just saying that there shouldn't be any problem in the future
Kiran, don't lie to me
is everything fine?
there is no problem, what problem there can be?
that's why I'm saying that there shall not be any problem in the future
what else can be the matter?
Kiran
Greetings mom!
Greetings! Where is Shahzain?
He had to go to the office
So he should have left after drinking tea
he will come in the evening, mom
Okay, come here
how are you?
how is my daughter?
what's the matter, you sound very happy today
yes, nowadays I can hear only happy songs everywhere
also Kiran is here at my house
and my sister is getting married tomorrow
are you sad?
yes... what will I do without her?
what's the problem in it?
whenever you miss her, call me. I will come to you
really?
ok listen
what are you wearing tomorrow at the wedding?
I know, you'll be the prettiest girl in the entire wedding 
really? Just in the wedding?
No... I didn't mean to say that
of the entire world
I was saying the wedding just like that
Ok listen, there is no need to stare Memon guys at the wedding tomorrow. Got it?
really! everyone has made a line for me of Memon guys
so, I have to look at someone for sure
and then what's the use of getting so much dolled-up. When I can't see someone & the other person cannot see me
No no, nobody will look at you. Not at all!
hey, if you are being so possessive then come & have a look
I?
there?
yes, if you have come courage then come over & show me
I will message you the place & time
Bye!
lets see how much courage do you have!
oho.. 
I'm so sorry... 
sorry!
total disaster!
its okay
Can I take it?
yes yes
I'm so sorry. Actually where is Maqsood?
he is here
is brother Yousuf inside?
yes, he is inside
let me go meet him
Greetings, how are you?
Ouch!
oh!
what had happened!
how did it broke?
are you ok?
yes, I am fine but my sandal broke
your hand is bleeding, keep it here
let me arrange some shoes for you
will you arrange a sandal?
I will manage it, relax & sit here. Ok
I am coming
aunty.. 
yes?
did you get today's arrangement done from the same guys, who had arranged the dance party?
No, what's wrong? Do I have to ruin my daughter's wedding?
We got all the arrangements done from brother Yousaf's friend
you have come?
how I couldn't have come?
actually, I thought.. first you shall see me. Then no matter, after that there shall be lines of guys
but nobody will live upto to your standard
such a confidence on yourself?
No
on our love
brother Saqib!
I will not come in this every time
brother Saqib I... 
Quiet!
not a single word
I won't let you fool anyone anymore
see... 
dad, have a look with your own eyes. What your dearest daughter has been doing
She isn't ashamed of the fact, that there is wedding going on in the house
the entire community is gathered
be thankful that we have caught her on the right time, else don't know what would have happened
No dad...
quiet! Not a single word
your sister's wedding is going on inside
whatever we'll discuss, we'll discuss at home. Got it?
Throw his guy out, I shouldn't see him inside!
get lost from here.. 
I will see you later
but... dad!
dad
keep the gun down
hey!
Saeed
dad, please listen to me once
listening to you is a different matter, I don't want to see your face even
you were my honor. 
Tomorrow I won't be upset if I will loose my wealth but.. 
I won't be able to tolerate my insult
Today, I will wed off Zara proudly for her sake
but... the reality is that you've made my head down with shame
dad
give me a chance to explain once
enough!
I request you to please forget your selfishness today for sometime
and meet everyone for Zara's sake with a smiling face
please
I don't want to say anything else to you
yes come
hey Farhad! What happened to you?
who did it? Take the name
Freeha?
what happened to Freeha?
Freeha...
what?
her brother & father saw us together
oh God!
how?
I want to talk to her
I want to speak to Freeha
give it to me!
I want to talk to Freeha
don't know in what condition she must be!
I am telling you, I will cut the hands of those whoever touched her!
haven't you gone mad? Come back to your senses!
why are you creating trouble for her?
and be thankful to God that you've come back in one piece
what else I shall do? Shall I sit here idly?
think calmly! think calmly sometime
you are angry, also the other party is angry. Everything will be ruined
listen to me, let me talk to them
I will ask them to beat me as much as they want to, but don't say anything to Freeha. Let me talk to them once please
nothing will happen, she is their daughter
they won't beat their daughter like this
try to understand
listen to me! Listen to me in a relaxed manner
sometimes its better not to do anything rather than doing, got it?
right now there is anger in situation, let it calm down first then we'll talk peacefully
just think, how will you show this face to your father?
go change, let me bring ice for you
