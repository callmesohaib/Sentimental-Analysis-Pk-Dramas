Please go for a few days.
my worries will reduce, please Fariha
Please go away for a few days.
Mother will not eat without me.
Alright...
There is no need to worry.
He's sad, he'll be fine
What if he doesn't?
There were a few things that I went to do, but now I'm back.
You will not go back to you wife, promise me.
Promise me... that you will not go.
Many congratulations. Saqib gave me the good news.
Thank you.
But you were late to congratulate me.
I thought you would distribute sweet meats as soon as you heard the news.
Were you not happy to hear the news?
Will you steal my happiness from me?
Why do you want to take away my son and his children from us?
I don't want to take them away from you.
Ask Saqib why he wants to separate.
I know who puts this in his heart.
Yes it is always the daughter-in-law's fault.
It is the responsibility of the daughter-in-law to keep the house together.
I am the one who has supported you most in this house.
I've thought of you like a daughter.
Is this how you repay me.
It would be better if you don't compare me to your daughter.
As far as your as breaking your home is concerned, that's because of Saqib, don't blame it on me.
If you want to talk about something, you can talk about it in front of him.
Rimsha...
Rimsha... what's the matter?
Get up...
Are you alright?
What happened to her? Get up.
Be careful... what happened.
Let's go to the hospital. I'll come with you.
Ask her to stay away from me.
What are you saying?
She came to fight with me.
We were arguing, but she got up and then fell.
Alright fine... I fell... but I am not feeling safe with her
What are you saying?
You have it wrong...
Please take me to the doctor.
Mother...
there isn't any such thing
I didn't expect this from you.
Mother... there is no need for you to follow us.
Be careful.
Rimsha..
I want to talk to you uncle.
I'm listening.
Kiran called yesterday.
She wants me to handle the catering business full time.
She's right.
Mother you know I have no interest in that.
What are you saying then? Will your sister handle things with the caterer?
Will you like that?
Shah-Zain will look after it.
Besides it's not in me...
Kiran was being stubborn yesterday, that's why...
Don't you dare...
Don't even think about giving Shah-Zain a single plate, let alone the entire business.
He cannot be trusted.
You are right. Have you forgotten how much dowry they asked us?
After all that you guys wanted that marriage, right?
Why are you saying such things now?
Did something happen?
Mother... did something happen?
You tell me..
I don't know. I have no idea.
Nothing has happened, it's just we don't like him.
Kiran was hiding something from me as well.
Mother, tell me if there's something.
Is that man troubling her?
Is he asking for more things?
Tell me, I'll set him straight!
Nothing has happened. She's married now...
She has other responsibilities.
You're the son of this house.
So being our son why would someone else run the business?
At lease think of us now.
Why are you being selfish?
All of us need you.
Have you decided then?
Yaqoob Karim Baksh's catering business...
will be handled by his son now...
Right?
It's settled then.
Wait a minute...
Greetings*
I decided that we should eat this korma with you.
It's good you did.
Come in please... I didn't feel like making anything at home.
Have a seat, I'll bring the plates.
She didn't feel like eating, I'm sure there's some trouble.
She does look worried.
Here you are...
Sit down.
Of course.
Here you are.
Your auntie like always has put two plates in front of herself.
Here you are...
Are you worried?
Are you feeling well?
We don't like you being silent like this.
What can I do? I sit here alone all day, I over think then I get worried.
Things like this happen. Let me tell you one thing...
There is a fun of being alone, if only one could get the chance.
What do you mean?
Meaning... a few years ago...
my mother called me back to Peshawar...
There was no mobile phone or internet back then.
Sometimes we used to talk and sometimes we wouldn't.
It took me longer than expected at Peshawar...
Your auntie thought that my mother had convinced me to stay.
No only did I think that...
It was his mother's wish to get him married there.
But I didn't... I fell in love with you...
I stopped eating. I didn't even eat my mother's cooking.
I even told my mother that I will only live with Shanno.
And I will only die with her.
Anyways...
What he means to stay... don't worry.. Farhad will be back.
Where can he go but here?
Thank you that you guys came here. I like spending time with you guys.
Don't worry... we are always with you. Ok?
Thank you... please start.
Korma!
What did the doctor say?
She said that the child is fine and I am too.
That's great news.
I'm in pain..
what does that doctor know about the amount of pain I'm in.
Where are you feeling it?
I got hurt in my arm.
But when you sat in the car, you said that your leg hurt.
Can't one hurt in one's arm and leg at the same time?
No one believes me!
I believe you.. do one thing...
Improve your mood. And tell me what happened.
Your mother came to my room and started to scold me.
She told me that I was the one who forced you to separate our home.
I asked her the reason why I would do such a thing.
I've been living together for so many years...
I was coming to you...
Then I don't know what happened.
All I know that she was very angry.
I think your mother is jealous of our happiness.
I thought that she would be happy to hear about her grandchild.
But now... she still has complaints for us.
I was waiting for you.
It's good you're here.
Now...
Take over brother's place.
Everything is how he left it...
Look...
I know that she's your mother.
And you also know that I don't complain.
But before this she's said a lot of thing and I've always ignored it.
But it's about our child now..
That's why I had to speak up...
I don't want to go home.
What do you mean?
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?
I want to go to brother's home.
What?
I want to go to brother's home.
I don't feel like going home.
What if something happens to our child?
I've told you so many times, you're my responsibility.
But the rest of your family doesn't like me.
Who does not like you?
You and our child have the most right over that house.
But...
No buts, don't worry about anyone. I'll take care of it.
More than myself I care about this child.
God has blessed us, but certain people will try to destroy it...
To hell with them!
I'll see how they will do that!
I'll sort everyone out.
Just don't worry.
Let's have some coconut water, it will be good for the kid. Do you want some?
Stop is here....
Add a leg piece to it... how can I eat this?
This is the customer's order! Have some shame!
You have so much biryani.... so what if I take a leg piece?
Give him some leg piece!
Give me the fat one.
Fate is a strange thing...
All my life I ran away from this...
and now I'm sitting here.
There is a possibility that this might be good for you.
Sometimes we must accept fate as it is...
All my fate is biryani and korma...
It's not like that, you have raita as well.
And... you always said that uncle didn't listen to you.
You wanted to change things around here. Change it then!
This is your chance... use your business brain.
Run it like you want to.
No.
This is not mine.
All my life father didn't trust me.
And after him I didn't want to come here either.
It's only because of mother and Kiran otherwise...
Why do you think so negatively?
Use that as an opportunity. Show them that you could do it.
I have to go home in the evening. Take care of everything in my absence...
Alright I'll take care of it... don't worry.
Did you want something?
The catering house.
What do you mean?
You know it very well.
Did you talk to your brother?
Rimsha say something.
Saqib, what did the doctor say? Is everything alright?
There is no need to worry... everything is alright.
Thank God.
I didn't push her my dear.
She has a misunderstanding.
Rimsha go and rest. The doctor has asked her to rest.
I didn't expect this from you mother.
I did no such thing Saqib.
Why don't you believe me?
You know that we got such great news after such a long time...
And... when I heard that my grandchild wouldn't live with us here...
I got angry.
But... after hearing the good news you should have gone there to congratulate her...
instead you argued with her.
Why are you worried? Many congratulations!
You've made me happy... you've given me great news!
We're about to become grandparents. Forget everything else..
Why are you sitting here?
There is no need to worry. You've made me very happy!
Congratulation my dear!
Thank you...
Bless you dear..
Your father is right.
We can't change the past. We'll discuss things later.
Alright.
Keep the vegetables on the table.
Farhaad?
You didn't tell me that you were coming.
I felt like seeing you.
You always said that you found peace looking at me.
That you stop feeling tired.
It is still like that?
I'm very tired...
People being upset with me...
has tired me.
I've always had complaints against him.
But now that he's gone...
I don't understand how to feel.
I'm sad...
I'm angry...
And somewhere I feel guilty.
It seems as though...
a storm passed.
And now there is silence everywhere.
Farhaad...
It hurts when we are away from the people we love.
But we only be patient with the people who leave this world.
Father gave the catering business to Kiran.
And Kiran wants to me to take care of it.
What should I do?
Farhaad...
I know that you wanted to do something else.
But... who knows...
It is possible that you'll get all you answers from that catering business.
I'm not feeling well... 
I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
Sure go ahead.
Believe me, ever since sister told me...
I've been so happy. I couldn't stop myself.
But I'm upset at all of you. 
The Motiwala family is about to be blessed with a baby...
and you guys haven't distributed any sweetmeats.
You are their aunt, it's your responsibility to distribute it as well.
That's true, I'll distribute to, like I did for Saqib.
Believe me... you don't know the happiness you've given this family.
I pray that child bless this entire family.
Why are you here?
Why are you speaking to me like that? I heard the news...
So you decided to ruin it?
No Saqib...
You have it wrong. It's not like that.
I thought that...
it was great news...
We wanted to congratulate you...
Thank you very much for congratulating...
You can go now.
Alright fine... we'll leave, it's alright.
May God bless you two.
It's hard to stop oneself when it comes to family.
That's why your aunt is sitting here. You have it wrong.
May God bless you two. We'll get going.
We'll meet brother Yousuf and sister downstairs.
No... let's go home.
Alright, we'll get going.
Did you want something?
The catering business.
What do you mean?
You now what I mean.
Did you talk to your brother?
Tell him that you want to sell this catering business.
Besides, he has no interest in this business.
It is possible that he wants to further the business.
Wait a second...
What did you say?
After father's death, Farhaad is taking the business and family seriously.
If he's serious, then he should find something for himself. 
This is not his decision to make.
This decision can only be made by the one who owns the business.
And you will do as I say.
Right?
Sure.
Not much time has passed since father's death.
Everyone is grieving, how can I...
I don't care...
I'm looking for a buyer, I'll sell it once I get a good deal.
The most I can wait is for forty days.
You can talk to whomever you want...
whenever you want.
Hello Kiran...
JoJo how are you?
I'm well... I was going to work. How are you?
How's Shah-Zain?
Everything's fine.
Is everything okay?
No, I wanted to discuss something with you.
Sure what is it?
I have a request...
I know Farhaad is trying with the catering business, but make him understand...
how important the business is for us.
He's working hard, all he needs is a little time.
Everything is in front of you. He's taken responsibility of the entire business.
It will take some time.
You're right... 
I'm worried all the time that he might do something...
that might accost us and the business.
Don't worry about that. I'm here.
He's a better business man than me.
Thanks.
I've found strength after talking to you.
Don't thank your brother.
I'll hang up... we'll talk later.
Take care... farewell.
Farhaad my dear where are you?
You know I can't sleep. Please come home.
Auntie, greetings... 
it's Freeya.
What are you doing with my son's phone? 
Have you no shame?
Do you have any idea how much pain you're causing your parents?
Why don't you leave? Send my son back!
You're not married to him.
I don't accept such a marriage. A marriage that was done in secret.
Do you think marriage is a joke?
Families get married... I don't accept it!
Do you think that I'll bring you to my home as my daughter-in-law?
You've destroyed our life... my husband is dead... you killed him.
I will not make you part of my life.
Send my son back! Go home!
Don't take a mother's curse!
Auntie...
Farhaad come home.
Shaggo...Shaggo.
You didn't say a word in the car... and now...
What is there left for me to say or hear?
These kids...
don't know how to maintain relationships. What can I do now?
You're right.
But he's compelled by his anger.
Am I responsible? 
Did I ask Freeya to run away and marry someone?
They didn't attend our wedding as well.
Will he behave like that with me for the rest of his life?
I went there with such affection.
I thought that everything would be okay.
Nothing is okay.
Rather...
I got you insulted as well.
There is no need for you to worry about my insult...
Shaggo... respect is in the hands of God.
There is nothing in the hands of us humans. 
I think that he'll get better.
Soon he'll come running to you.
I don't think he will. You didn't see his attitude.
He was shouting at me.
And.. his wife.
she doesn't care.
I'm telling you that he'll realize his mistake.
And that won't take much time.
Shaggo... I thought that...
we would have dinner on our way back. But your mood...
has killed my hunger.
Call out your hunger!
I'm hungry!
Do you want to eat at home or outside?
I think...
we should order it at home.
Sure, I'll get the plates.
Freeya...
Did someone call?
Your mother.
Did you pick up?
What did you say to her?
Why was she surprised that you were here?
Does she think that we've separated?
No Freeya..
Mother wants me to live with her. I'm just stalling.
Without me?
Your mother said that you could come back, but without me.
But I refused. I said that I won't live without you. 
You should have told her the same...
There is a difference between your family and mine.
Father just passed away, my mother is grieving...
On top of that she's in depression. I can't bother her in her state.
Will you continue doing this and I will remain your secret wife?
You will come here whenever you want, otherwise you'll stay there. 
Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to live here alone?
Why are you living alone? 
I've asked you to live with your aunt for a while.
Farhaad... that is not my home.
 I can live there as a guest for a few days, but not for the rest of my life... my home is here with you...
We're husband and wife, we need to handle the situation together.
Freeya... you can't understand my problems...
And I don't want to discuss this please...
Do you know what your problem is? You try to avoid every situation.
I try to avoid it?
Have some fear... that's  my family, I have to take care of their issues.
You're one of their problem.
Is there no solution to this problem?
Let me know if you have any ideas, because I don't.
What would you have done if your father had died?
Freeya!
I'm trying...
But I can't take you there right now. Please understand this.
Here you are.
What are you doing? It's not for you.
I'm just checking the quality. Very important.
Brother Yousuf is right, you shouldn't stop him in the middle of eating...
Let me check the quality as well.
Sure.
Go ahead... you've been walking a lot haven't you.
I'll start walking from today.
We will...
We will...
Shaggo...
The money for the blessing.
I almost forgot.
Many congratulations... please distribute it.
Brother Yousuf ordered this for you especially.
No, thank you. I'm not in the mood.
Rimsha... sit with us...
Let's plan the baby shower.
I'm not well. I want to rest.
Sure... go ahead...
Go ahead... I'll send fruits to your room.
Go ahead...
Here you are.
It's very fine.
