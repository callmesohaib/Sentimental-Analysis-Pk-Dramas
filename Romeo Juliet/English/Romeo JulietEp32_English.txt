I hope you don't have any other plans in your mind with that guy
No... not at all! Are you mad?
 no no..
by the way, he is very cute 
really? Are you telling the truth?
 do we joke with each other? 
No, we don't
I have gathered it in my entire life with hard work & love
if you also have a daughter 
then God will give you the punishment of your arrogance in this world
I think... 
there is nobody in this world except for you
Farhad 
what's the matter? Jojo was telling me that its an urgent matter
is everything fine? 
I hope there isn't any issue of Malpura (dessert) otherwise, my family will kill me!
SShh.... 
be quiet
I've gathered the courage with a lot of difficulty
 maybe, I won't be able to say it again
Freeha
I...
I have fallen in love with you
I don't know what happens to me after seeing you
It feels... 
there is nobody in this world except for you
maybe I've become crazy but... 
seriously..
I love you!
brother Saqib!
you got scared, right?
its not so easy to fall in love with me, it needs a lot of courage
you can try me
time will tell, whether you pass or fail in this love test
I haven't failed till date
because you have never faced such a beautiful exam in your life ever
even a great player starts sweating 
are you challenging me?
challenge is such a small word
you can consider it as your death's well
alright then
you can send me in whichever war zone you want to
I've also decided to win
listen.. .
are you with me?
neither you'll get this answer so easily nor so quickly
how are you?
good!
is everything fine?
yes brother Yousuf, all good!
All good? So its been how long that you came back from Dubai?
I just came back 2 months ago
you did good, after all your own house is your own
hey Shaggo, listen
yes
come here
yes
yes... see, he is Hamid
do you remember my friend Imran? He is his cousin
Okay
yes yes
he used to be in Dubai but now he is back here & settled
Okay
she is my sister
how are you?
I'm good!
See, he is from our community so I've invited him so that he can meet everyone
since he is here, so he shouldn't be alone
you might be feeling lonely sometimes, right?
No brother Yousuf, sometimes I do meet a few interesting people 
its good
Hamid look, this is your own house
consider it as your own house, you are not alone anymore. We are all family
thank you!

Okay

take care of him, ok?
yes
serve him some dessert or so
Please excuse me
would you like to have something?
Thank you and excuse me
what do you mean that there is nothing with Malpura (dessert)?
but they've just ordered Malpura
what?
I'm saying, I was asked to bring only Malpura
only Malpura? Haven't you gone mad?
sorry madam, please tell me. Let me arrange it right away, no problem
the guests are here, the dinner is served already. Nothing can be arranged now
Shamshad, I had told you that nothing shall be wrong with the Malpura
its the best in this city
what best?
what do we serve with it?
I was asked to get Malpura, and I have arranged it
I don't know anything extra
Okay
let me check
what is going with Malpura?
I wanted to talk to you about something
It was in my car
this mandate has become quite a burden on me
excuse me!
its almost on the way, aunty.. 
oh! did you hear what he said to me? He was calling me aunty!
how dare you calling her aunty?
no no, I mean...
my mistake!
Malpura, you caterer. Look at the time, the guests are here already
give me some time please
Jojo?
Who is this Jojo?

hey, this is for you. Go & enjoy
good night, sir
lets go
keep an eye on them, what if they take our things
come on, keep it
there is a lot of difference between you & her
about culture, class, language
you are taking such a big challenge
have I ever took any small challenge ever?
have you seen her brother, how he was talking? He was showing us our stature
he is my to-be brother-in-law
I will straighten him on the right time
lets go, if you are done with your romance of Romeo & Juliet
Moosa is waiting for us at the tea
you go, I'm coming
hey, what's your amount?
here comes my friends
how are you, bro?
how are you doing?
I am very well!
Saif, dear two cup of tea
my hero, my cheetah!
I feel so good, how are you?
I am good brother, you tell me
I am always set
finally you've remembered your brother, right?
oh brother Moosa, we are doing hard work. Sometimes here or there... 
your dramas are never ending
in what things you are into nowadays?
brother is into so many things nowadays
what?
what's the scene? What is he saying?
Nothing! he is habitual of talking rubbish
there is something going on in between you two, right?
not at all, he is talking rubbish!
how are you, brother Farhad?
Saif dear, how are you? how are your studies going?
very well, but I am a bit weak in mathematics
so what's the tension in it? Come home, I will prepare you very well. You'll do top
ok brother
do hard work, come on
open a tuition academy
I will open that too, shall we play carom?
lets go!
lets go, come on
yes brother, two cups of tea
haven't you ordered the tea as of yet?
so tell me, what's up?
I'm fine, what about you?
very well... 
I will win for sure!
in my presence?
oh brother, how much time does it take to bring the tea?
bring it, hurry up
will you bring it once we'll left from here?
hey have you gone mad? What are you doing? Crazy!
I haven't done it deliberately
will you argue now!
why you've kept these kids here? They can't do any work properly
look here
Farhad!
Shahzain?
Farhad, you!
you've raised your hand on me for this lowly guy?
Shahzain, I... 
but why were you beating the kid?
he had spilled the entire tea on me, also he isn't taking the order properly. What else I shall do?
so what's wrong? He made a mistake, why did you beat him?
be thankful that you are my brother-in-law
otherwise, I would have told you!
Farhad.. Farhad!
he is your brother-in-law!
leave me!
is this Kiran's choice?
leave it, we have a wedding in our house. What if it gets spoiled
Jojo, he is walking red flag!
can you see your red flags?
even if I will show you a red flag, you won't be able to see it
thank you, brother Farhad
who does this for the people like us nowadays
I will never forget this
are you fine?
yes brother
come on go... 
lets go from here
come on!
Kiran
what happened?
what is this, Farhad?
Shahzain, its hurting
this pain is nothing, Kiran
in front of the pain that your brother gave me
what are you saying, what happened?
so mom, tell me did you like anyone?
I've shown you so many suitors
there is a line of guys to become the son-in-law of Yousuf Motivala
We've got the proposals of the sons of big businessmen
any reply from Freeha?
I don't understand this girl at all
she rejects the guy as soon as she sees the picture
mom, honestly speaking this girl has become her own enemy
we aren't showing her any inappropriate proposals, we've shown her the best of all suitors
yes, but she doesn't listen to me at all
if I pressurize her, she runs to her father & complains about me
then convince dad
right aunt Shaggo?
did you like any guy?
guy?
why would I like any guy?
what rubbish you're talking?
why, don't you want Freeha to get married?
Freeha!
Freeha...
Freeha
yes, who else?
now we won't be discussing for your proposal in this age
yes Shaggo, please talk to Freeha
she considers you as her friend more than her aunt
yes sister, let me explain her & talk to her
excuse me...
such a big example is present in our house
and still you guys aren't afraid
do you want her to stay at home unmarried like aunt Shaggo?
God forbid! Why are you saying this?
I must say, try to keep Freeha away from aunt Shaggo
why?
mom, you are so naive
She considers aunt Shaggo her friend & her ideal
you guys have such a big heart that you've accepted her once again after forgiving her
if any girl would have done the same thing in our family, then they would have kept her away at an arm's length
according to her, she is thinking about Freeha's betterment
but don't know, what if she is brain washing her!
otherwise, why is she refusing by just looking at the pictures?
I think its something else
Freeha...
have you seen this video?
this is the same guy...
he seems like a hooligan to me from day one
stay away from him
this is the condition of our society
the kid had spilled the tea by mistake so they've started beating her
See, how he is fighting!
everyone thinks of them as a pharaoh
but this guy has not only taught them a lesson but has also shown that humanity still exists
first of all, we shall discourage child labor
and if we see that someone is treating them badly, then please raise your voice
protect them, the way this guy did
don't get into all this
don't know what is his background. He is wandering on the streets
such guys like to become a hero!
when did I say anything?
you have shown me this video, I haven't said anything though
don't know what you're thinking by yourself
hey Shahzain... 
Kiran
one minute...
yes Shahzain?
ok fine, I've understood
yes
Okay, shall I call you back?
I'll call you back
Bye!
Bye...
was it Shahzain?
yes
what was he saying?
he was saying... in fact he was telling me that how many people are coming from his side to attend the wedding
didn't he tell you anything else?
what else?
Kiran, I..
I wanted to tell you something...
shall I tell you something?
Still I can't believe that I am getting married
and this phone! Whenever this phone rings
I feel anxious, that don't know what has happened now
but see, thanks to God that everything is happening so smoothly
and Shahzain!
he is totally mad! Do you know what he was saying just now?
he was discussing that which colors flowers will be decorated in the room
its like, he wants me to come over there
and I shall feel that I am coming into my own house
Kiran, actually...
hey... dear Kiran
come dad
this Mister is also here
here you go
this is for you, dear
what's in it?
open it
what's there?
its a gold set for my daughter
its so beautiful
but its expensive as well, I am sure about it
but its not expensive than our daughter
what was the need for it? You guys already do so much for me
what we've done? We have done nothing
We really feel like doing a lot, but our pocket doesn't allow us
See, I'm advising you. Please don't say such things
you guys have always done more than our expectations, you have never given me a chance to complain
so I'll get upset if you'll say such things
do you like it?
its best, and so beautiful
so Mister?
have you gifted anything to your sister or not?
yes, I've ordered. Soon it will be delivered
your brother is handicapped, he cannot visit the market for his sister
he can only place an order by his phone & order non-sense things
he will always stay stupid
its your dad's choice
why am I always insulted?
Farhad...
you know...
explain him
I haven't forgotten, ok? It will be delivered
be careful about the flame, it shouldn't get low
keep it appropriate, come on
be quick, everyone
hurry up, what is this drama?
very good, be careful
hey Mister, did you talk to Shamshad?
yes dad, Jojo will look after everything
at least help us in this
dad, actually... let me iron the clothes first
you always focus on your clothes only
hurry up, be quick
aunty, iron my clothes too
please iron them
dear, I've come to attend the wedding but see what work they've given me. I'm so tired
this is why we've invited you
Farhad, do the video call at the time of the wedding ceremony
Nasir will join us
Done! Any other order?
stay blessed dear, stay happy
Nasir will join us!
Farhad...
mom, what are you doing? Why you haven't got ready? Look at the time
yes..
you didn't applied the henna as well
I? Ok tell me, have you arranged the religious scholar?
yes yes, its done. Go, get ready please
are you sure?
yes yes
Farhad...
where is your uncle?
uncle has left for America
what! 
yes yes, I saw him going to the airport a while ago
how can he go whiteout me? I've all his belongings
oh wow! show me... shall I spoil it?
oh brother Saleem, what do you do? At least, remove these curtains
its a wedding house, and why do I have to tell everything
hey he is here, be careful...
do one thing, send the basket to the mosque & pick the religious scholar
and and...  do ask about the rice pudding from Shamshad. Ok?
I shall do everything, so what you're doing?
what are you saying? I've got so much of work
come on!
Kiran
what happened?
what is this, Farhad?
oh this...
who made this video
and who had posted it on the internet
yes, its had been viral as of yet
listen, did Shahzain sent you this?
No, my friends have sent me. When did it happen & why didn't you tell me?
that night I came to tell you, but I thought if Shahzain haven't told you then lets end the matter
its a small mistake
small mistake?
Farhad, this matter hasn't ended. It can be escalated!
Shahzain didn't tell me, but what was the need for you two to fight like this?
actually that day he got angry on the waiter, & I got furious on him
but as soon as we saw each other, the matter ended there & then
the matter is ended?
then what is this video?
yes?
maybe Shahzain hasn't seen the video
let me talk to someone & get it removed immediately
Farhad...
already this matter has been settled down with a lot of difficulty, what if something goes wrong then?
why will anything happen?
listen to me, they are about to come for the wedding ceremony. So get ready
there won't be anymore issue about this matter, ok?
if Shahzain would have seen it, then he might have said something
I think, it didn't made any difference to him
and if he haven't seen it, then lets get it removed timely
I know a guy who is technical, he will do this work
Kiran
is Shahzain understanding?
yes
will he take care of you?
of-course!
then why are you worried?
and if he'll annoy you then I will...
Farhad, stop it! I get tensed because of your these words & actions
you've started again...
Ok sorry, I won't do any such thing
happy?
don't you worry at all
what!
you know, I can do anything for your happiness
take care of yourself
and do let me know if you have any problem
promise?
promise!
the groom's family is here
shall we go?
smile...
hello!
hello! I hope I haven't disturb you
not at all, in fact its my good luck that you've called me
really?
Okay
I wanted to ask you something
go ahead
you didn't tell me that you're so famous
what do you mean?
your video got viral everywhere
oh! that video
but I've got it removed
why? you've taught such a great lesson to that guy
really?
but my sister was so angry with me
why?
actually that guy in the video was her fiance
in fact, now he is her husband
really?
did you find that guy fine for your sister?
No
but she finds him well
maybe I will never find any guy right for her
as she is so nice
nobody can be compatible for her
is your sister happy?
yes
today was her wedding ceremony
Wow! heartiest congratulations!
I am missing her a lot
do you love your sister that much?
very much...
she was my only crime partner in this house
do you know, I can do anything for her
I cannot see pain on her face
I am missing her too much
that's so sweet
really?
yes
so then?
so what?
we'll meet tomorrow, I will message you the place & time. Bye!
hey hello! Hello?
Shahzain, its hurting
Shahzain, its hurting...
this pain is nothing, Kiran
in front of the pain that your brother gave me
what are you saying, what happened?
what happened?
Shahzain!
by getting my video viral, in which he is beating me
what do you think?
will I forget this all? Will I!
he hasn't done that deliberately. Farhad tried his level best to get that video removed from the internet
what are you saying?
whoever had to see that video, they've seen it
but sorry to say...
Sorry to say that my cousin had showed it to me after the wedding ceremony
what if he has shown you before the wedding ceremony?
if he would have shown me earlier
then maybe Kiran you hadn't been here
what!
Shahzain
Shahzain, don't escalate the matter. He hasn't done that deliberately
Shahzain...
he didn't even know who posted it
do you think I'm such a big fool, right?
Am I a stupid guy?
your brother consider himself a very big hero
I know this very well that he did all this deliberately!
no no...
No no!
yes!
No... Shahzain
just to insult me, nothing else
first he had misbehaved with my parents, then he did drama with me
no no, you know there isn't any such thing
its like that Kiran!
absolutely
Shahzain
but I won't sit in peace
I will get him humiliated!
I won't be satisfied until I don't get his video viral
don't escalate the matter, Shahzain!
Shahzain...
mom
mom, don't know what Shahzain is saying. Please make him understand
we had tried to explain Shahzain a lot
that he shouldn't get involved with the people like you
but at that time, you had convinced him with your love
but thanks God, now his eyes are opened
mom, what are you saying? At least you can make him understand
I've explained him. I've explained him in a very well manner...
Shahzain will come inside the room, once we'll get the car
