[01:07] This girl cannot be my daughter in law.
[01:11] Hamza I'm ordering you to divorce this girl right now.
[01:38] Are you feeling better now?
[01:40] I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
[01:42] If you're not okay, should I call the doctor?
[01:46] I'm fine.
[01:50] See Falak, you knew how would mom react.
[01:55] She's not happy with our wedding.
[02:01] She will not accept our marriage, so fast.
[02:04] I had an idea but I didn't know she'd react so severely.
[02:15] Alright. She could have been angry or scolded us.
[02:20] I would have listened to everything but this threat to throw me out of the house,
[02:26] we got married Hamza, we've not sinned.
[02:29] I'm sorry for mom's reaction.
[02:34] She was very harsh.
[02:37] She shouldn't have done that.
[02:40] But the fact is, you'll have to tolerate her taunts for a little while.
[02:47] She will have to bear her strict behavior
[02:49] and I believe the way you've made a place in my life,
[02:54] you'll make a place in my mom's and sister's life as well.
[03:00] Yes but, I'm scared Hamza.
[03:04] Her behavior has scared me. This seems very difficult. How will I do everything Hamza?
[03:11] Time will fix everything.
[03:17] She is just angry that's why she's behaving like this.
[03:22] You'll see, she'll be fine in a few days.
[03:27] I hope to God this happens.
[03:31] Everything happened so fast that I couldn't think of having the room decorated.
[03:38] Whats are you saying?
[03:40] You're in my life now. Everything else is meaningless.
[03:47] I'm a part of your life, its enough for me.
[03:52] Thank you.
[04:13] I will not tolerate this girl in my house at all.
[04:20] This matter will not be solved like this, mom. Didn't you see mutiny in Hamza's eyes?
[04:26] This is all because of this girl. She poisoned Hamza's mind.
[04:31] Hamza has never talked to me like this.
[04:35] I'm telling you, if Hamza doesn't divorce her, I'll throw Hamza and her out of the house immediately.
[04:43] I don't care what they do but this girl cannot live in my house. I don't give a damn.
[04:48] No mom. What are you saying?
[04:52] Will you throw your only son out for this girl?
[04:56] You'll not do this. We'll handle this matter in another way.
[05:02] What should I do? I cannot tolerate it.
[05:05] I want to strangle that girl right now. God knows what she fed my son.
[05:12] My son has always been obedient.
[05:16] He has always listened to what I said, today..
[05:21] he took such a big decision in his life without asking and without informing.
[05:28] This means, he didn't respect or gave his mother any importance. This is unimaginable.
[05:37] Mom, even I don't believe this.
[05:40] Please be strong. Everything will be alright.
[06:24] You've still kept all these things safe?
[06:27] These things are very important for me.
[06:30] They remind me of you.
[06:33] You shouldn't be so surprised.
[06:35] I'm just showing you these so that you believe me that I'll never stop loving you.
[07:42] See, I got what I wanted. I told you I'd not accept defeat. I've married him.
[07:53] You're my only sister. I thought I'd tell you.
[07:56] Will you not congratulate me?
[08:12] Its the same thing. Do you think Hamza didn't tell them anything?
[08:16] Mom I'm 100% sure, Sofia aunty and her daughter knew everything.
[08:20] Its the same thing. How would they see their son's fault? How would they hold him accountable?
[08:25] That's why they came to you because you'd agree to everything and listen to them.
[08:36] We're getting married and you will be resigning in a month.
[08:40] Do it now. I won't let you work once we're married.
[08:46] If you still want to work, join my office.
[08:53] I've never seen an egoistic man like Hamza ever.
[08:58] Do you know Nawal, all these men are the same?
[09:01] They think a woman is weak.
[09:05] Had I been in your place, I'd have said no clearly.
[09:08] Don't worry, you're not alone. Mom and I are with you.
[09:13] You'll have to decide. We will only get married if you resign from your job.
[09:20] If you won't resign, I'll not marry you.
[09:51] Strawberry jam.. Here..
[09:55] Hello. Good morning.
[09:59] Hello. Wait.
[10:06] She cannot sit here.
[10:19] Send her food to her room.
[10:25] What are you saying? There's no use of saying this.
[10:29] Falak is my wife. She's a part of this house.
[10:32] And she will sit here with us.
[10:35] She might be your wife but she isn't a part of this family or this house.
[10:45] If you clearly explain it to her, it would be best.
[10:48] Also she shouldn't be coming face to face with me. For the best.
[11:12] What are you thinking? Are you mad?
[11:29] Please, ignore her harsh attitude for a few days.
[11:36] I understand Hamza but I'm a human being as well.
[11:40] I get hurt with this attitude. Whats my fault?
[11:45] And make her understand that we got married. We're not sinning.
[11:50] Our religion allows us to get married and live as we like.
[11:59] Don't cry please. Look at me.
[12:05] You don't have to worry much.
[12:08] It'll take some time but everything will be alright then.
[12:14] Okay?
[12:28] Yes?
[12:32] Sir I needed Ms. Nawal's signature on this file.
[12:35] I've been calling her but she isn't receiving. What should I do?
[12:39] Keep this here. I'll see. Thank you.
[12:50] Kabeer? My friend.. Did you hear something?
[12:56] What?
[13:00] Hamza is married now.
[13:05] And that too with your ex-wife, Falak.
[13:22] Who told you this?
[13:25] The entire society knows. You're the only one who doesn't know.
[13:31] I don't care what they do or what they don't.
[13:36] Its good.
[13:40] Tell me, we have a meeting with Rafay. When will we leave?
[13:45] Yes. Is it possible that you attend the meeting yourself? Actually I'm not feeling well.
[13:52] I want to go home and get some rest.
[13:55] Okay. No worries. You go home and rest.
[14:00] And I'll update you whatever happens.
[14:03] Thank you. See you.
Okay
[15:11] Falak? Come, you haven't eaten anything since morning.
[15:15] Hamza, I'm not eating anything. You eat.
[15:18] Why don't you want to eat? Will you stay hungry like this? Come on. Come with me.
[15:23] Hamza... Didn't you see what aunty did? If I come with you, she'll scold me more.
[15:27] This was our first breakfast after we got married.
[15:30] She taunted me so much.
[15:33] She could have been quiet for the sake of her son's happiness, if not mine.
[15:40] I told you earlier as well. It'll take some time and then everything will be alright.
[15:44] But what if they create differences between us until then?
[15:48] If you get pressurized by your family and divorce me.. I'll be, once more..
[15:55] What are you saying?
[15:57] Why are you even thinking that?
[16:00] Why do you even think that? Throw these thoughts out.
[16:05] Hamza I was going through a very tough time in my life when you came along.
[16:11] Its your encouragement that allowed me to get stable.
[16:14] God forbid if we part ways now.
[16:17] If you leave me, what will I do? How will I live?
[16:22] What are you saying?
[16:25] Trust me. I'm with you and I'll always be with you.
[16:32] I promise.
[16:33] I miss mom very much.
[16:35] Had she been with me, this wouldn't have happened.
[16:38] Is this the way to treat a new bride?
[16:42] Everybody treats a new bride with love and respect and here..
[16:47] I was threatened to be thrown out and insulted on the breakfast table.
[16:52] I know...
[16:53] Falak, I'll do one thing. We'll have lunch outside. Okay? Just you & me
[16:59] No Hamza, I'm telling you. I've heard enough, now I'm not hungry.
[17:04] I'll not take no for an answer.
[17:06] Get ready in 10 minutes. Don't change. Your dress is beautiful
[17:10] I'll go freshen up.
[17:52] Mr. Kabeer? You? Hello.
Hello. How are you?
[17:56] I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine as well. Is Nawal home?
[18:00] Yes she's home. She's in her room. She isn't well.
[18:04] Please come in. I'll call her.
[18:12] Please sit here. I'll call her.
Thank you.
[18:25] Nawal mam? Mr. Kabeer is here. Nawal mam?
[18:32] Mam? Nawal mam? What happened?
[18:45] Mr. Kabeer..
What happened?
[18:48] Nawal mam is unconscious?
Unconscious? Where is she?
[18:53] She's in her room. Please come.
[19:10] Nawal?
[19:12] Nawal? Nawal.. She has high fever.
[19:16] Get some water. I'll call an ambulance.
[19:36] Doctor, how is she now?
[19:38] She's better than before. She fainted because of the fever and weakness.
[19:44] Is she conscious now?
[19:45] She's conscious. We're shifting her in a room. Then you can meet her.
[19:51] Okay. Thank you.
[20:17] Hello.
[20:20] Naveen, dear, go to your room.
[20:22] You're my uncle's bride?
Of course.
[20:26] Naveen dear, good girl. Go to your room.
[20:34] I thought you'd never come to me so I came to you.
[20:39] Someone has to bridge the distance so I thought I'd take the first step.
[20:48] I talked to Aaliya some time ago and she told me a lot about you.
[20:53] First I was surprised and didn't believe her.
[20:58] But I do know that Aaliya cannot lie.
[21:05] She told me how you trapped Kabeer and took advantage of him.
[21:10] And how you created problems for him and his family.
[21:17] Kabeer was sensible that he didn't listen to you.
[21:21] Now you'll do the same here because people never lets go of their habits.
[21:30] I respect you a lot but if you disrespect me,
[21:35] don't expect me to insult you.
[21:38] I think Aaliya didn't tell you the many things I can do.
[21:44] See Falak, I'm warning you.
[21:48] You might have entered the house after marrying Hamza, but none of your moves will make a difference here.
[22:42] How are you feeling now?
[22:46] You brought me to the hospital?
[22:51] Actually I was calling you all day but you didn't answer.
[22:55] We needed your signature on an important document so I came myself.
[23:04] Its good that I came.
[23:06] I'm sorry. I bothered you a lot.
[23:11] Nawal please don't be formal. You didn't bother me at all.
[23:16] In fact I'm happy I could be of use.
[23:23] I have a complaint..
[23:28] You were so unwell and you didn't even tell me. You didn't even call.
[23:34] I thought I was very strong and I'd not die so easily but see,
[23:45] I survived this.
[23:48] Should I tell you something?
[23:52] Someone who didn't be yours after so much love and loyalty,
[23:59] trust me, he can never be anybody's.
[24:06] Whether it is Falak or Hamza, both of them are selfish and apathetic.
[24:16] Both of them have hurt a lot of people. They'll not be happy.
[24:26] You'll see. Time will decide and when time decides, it doesn't need witnesses.
[24:40] Excuse me,
[24:44] this is her diet plan. She is very weak. Please follow this.
[24:50] Thank you doctor.
[24:56] Kabir, I've wasted a lot of your time.
[25:00] you should go home. Ilham must be alone. You need to take care of her.
[25:05] Don't be formal. If I leave, who'll stay with you?
[25:10] I'll call my maid, she'll stay with me.
[25:14] No. Don't bother her.
[25:17] I'll stay with you. And Ilham's nanny is with her. I just talked.
[25:23] She had her milk and she slept.
[25:25] But Kabeer, I've already bothered you.
[25:29] This isn't bothering me. In fact I'm doing this happily. Relax.
[26:00] Hamza what have you thought, then?
About what?
[26:05] A reception for our wedding.
[26:08] I want you to publicly announce our wedding.
[26:11] And we'll have a big reception to announce this so that everybody knows about our wedding.
[26:16] I'll have a reception.
[26:18] But not yet. I have a lot of work. I don't have time.
[26:23] We'll think about it later.
[26:26] We'll have to tell everyone.
[26:28] I know the circumstances we got married in, we couldn't tell anyone or invite them.
[26:33] This is a good chance. We'll tell everyone and I'll invite them.
[26:37] And you know I'll invite the most famous photographer in our reception. He'll take the best pictures of us.
[26:44] So that I can show Kabeer and Nawal that we're happy together.
[26:52] How many times have I told you to not take their names in front of me?
[26:57] I'm sorry. I'll not do it again. But still I want them to realize.
[27:04] That they've lost so much. Especially Nawal. She should realize what she lost in you.
[27:12] Please Hamza don't say no. Listen to me.
[27:17] As it is, Nawal told me the day we got married that I'll never be happy.
[27:27] But I want to show them how happy I am and how much you care for me.
[27:34] Alright. If you wish, I'll do it.
[27:41] I knew it. You'd never say no to me. You've honored me.
[27:49] I'll go and change.
[27:56] I don't believe this.
[27:59] I was shocked after hearing the news.
[28:03] I'm surprised. Its unbelievable.
[28:06] Hamza left Nawal for a girl like Falak?
[28:11] Oh my God. And look at Falak?
[28:14] She destroyed her own sister's house.
[28:19] You know her instincts very well.
[28:22] Nothing is important to her. She only holds her own benefit dear and for that she can do anything.
[28:28] She can go to any limits. In fact she can sacrifice anyone.
[28:32] Yes but, Hamza..
[28:36] Falak is like that but Hamza could be so stupid?
[28:41] Once you're blindfolded by mistrust, you become blind literally.
[28:46] Yes. You're right.
[28:51] Mistrust is a disease the eats away the most beautiful of relationships.
[28:59] Tell me how is Nawal now?
[29:03] She's very depressed.
[29:04] Kabeer, make her understand that,
[29:08] we should be thankful if we lose careless people from our life.
[29:14] We don't need to make her understand.
[29:17] She got hurt so deeply that she'll understand herself.
[29:22] Talk to Toqueer please. Kabeer..
[30:21] Dad was saying that Falak's parents are dead. They're with God now.
[30:26] Yes, dear.
[30:27] And that's why Falak will live with us. Will you keep her in your room?
[30:33] Falak makes so much of noise. I'll not keep her in my room.
[30:35] If you don't keep her with you, she'll have to go to the orphan house.
[30:40] You've always wanted a younger sister and now Falak can be your younger sister.
[30:55] Sultana are you mad? You're worried for a servant's daughter? You've given her a car,
[31:02] She isn't a servant's daughter. She's my daughter.
[31:05]  I don't like it when you say that.
[31:07] Its different to bring someone up and to call them your own daughter.
[31:10] I've brought her up and I think of her as my own daughter.
[31:14] What does you thinking of her as your daughter do? Your own blood is your own only.
[31:33] Mam Nawal?
Yes?
[31:36] Are you okay?
[31:38] Yes I'm better than before.
[31:41] I've brought soup for you.
[31:44] Keep it here, I'll have it later.
[31:46] I know you'll not have it later. You're not taking care of yourself at all.
[31:56] Why are you worried? I'm fine.
[31:58] Can I tell you something mam? Whatever is hurting you,
[32:02] cry upon it once, you'll be at peace.
[32:06]  Mr. Hamza was your fiance.
[32:09] We had a boy in our village. He divorced his wife to marry her sister. 
[32:15] That girl didn't even think once.
[32:18] She destroyed her sister's house. 
[32:20] I've not seen an ungrateful woman like Falak, ever.
[32:26] You and mam did so much for her. 
[32:30] You took care of her more than your own self and see what she did with you.
[32:39] We made a mistake to recognize her.
[32:42] God is watching. Don't worry. You'll be rewarded for your patience.
[32:50] Please have this soup now.
[32:52] Keep it here, I'll have it later.
[32:55] Please do or else you'll not get better.
[33:06] There should be no changes. 
[33:09] I've already told you about the colors and theme.
[33:13] I'll tell you if there's something else. Okay. Bye.
[33:18] Who were you talking to?
[33:21] I want to host a grand reception dinner for my wedding. That's what I'm talking about.
[33:31] Have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind?
[33:34] Why? What happened?
[33:37] What happened? 
[33:39] Do you even realize what people are saying about us? We're being insulted.
[33:44] Mom, please.
[33:45] I've told you earlier, this doesn't bother me. 
[33:49] People talk and they will. I cannot let them govern my life.
[33:55] It might not make a difference to you but it does make a difference to me and your sister.
[34:01] I didn't realize you'll be so stupid. 
[34:05] You throw a party to celebrate your wedding when your family is happy. 
[34:10] You married that girl secretively.
[34:14] Mom please. You have no right to talk about Falak like this.
[34:21] She respects you very much. 
[34:23] If you cannot give her the value she deserves, don't. 
[34:27] But I won't let you insult her like this.
[34:30] Dear I don't have to insult her. 
[34:33] A girl who secretively marries someone, is insulted herself. 
[34:38] Please have some shame. If she doesn't, you should.
[34:41] She married her sister's fiance. Please for God's sake.
[34:46] Mom is right, Hamza.
[34:48] You don't have to hold a reception 
[34:50] and if you really want to hold a reception, invite a few friends for dinner.
[34:56] That would be enough.
[34:59] Just call the event manager and cancel everything.
[35:02] You've insulted us enough already. I will not tolerate more. 
[35:05] There will be no party in this house. That's it.
[35:26] Yes Zakiya?
[35:30]  Oh Kabeer, its you..
[35:34] I was passing by, I thought I'd make her meet you.
[35:38] You did good. I was feeling anxious as it is.
[35:43] You should have called me, I would have brought her to meet you.
[35:46] No, I've already bothered you a lot.
[35:51] Its okay. No problem.
How are you feeling now?
[35:56] She's here now. I'll be fine. Should I make a feeder for her? Come along.
[36:04] Lets go.
[36:07] I'm so upset. 
[36:09] The NGO meeting I went for, everybody was talking about Hamza's marriage there. 
[36:14] They had watched Falak's press conference.
[36:16] They were surprised how Hamza could marry such a girl.
[36:21] I was so embarrassed.
[36:23]  I couldn't see people in the eye. This boy has gotten us insulted. I couldn't see people in the eye.
[36:29] Mom, why are you embarrassed?
[36:32]  Those who should be embarrassed, are happy in their lives.
[36:37] They're hanging out and enjoying.
[36:43] I feel he isn't thinking before taking any decisions. 
[36:47] This boy has lost his mind.
[36:51] I had so many plans for him. I had so many dreams for my son.
[36:57] He destroyed everything, his life. What will I do about this boy now?
[37:09] You're the limit Hamza.
[37:12]  Aunty was talking as if we have committed a big sin.
[37:16] And you.. you should have said something to her. You just said yes to whatever she said.
[37:19] Do you think I didn't say anything to her?
[37:22] Falak she's the elder of our house and we married without her consent. She's upset with us.
[37:27] That's what I want to tell you Hamza. This is her problem.
[37:31] She never agreed for the wedding and I think she wants this marriage to end 
[37:35] so that she can get you married to Nawal.
[37:37] I have made no requests to you.
[37:39]  I just want, that you announce our marriage publicly? 
[37:43] What wrong am I saying? Its my right.
Mom isn't agreeing.
[37:50] What if I arrange a party and there's a problem?
[37:52]  We will all get insulted in front of the guests.
[37:56] Let this matter cool down and mom accept us. We'll plan this then.
[38:01]  Just postpone it until then.
[38:03] I have no worth in your eyes.
[38:08] If aunty wants you to leave me, will you divorce me?
[38:11] What are you saying? This won't happen.
[38:16] I cannot tell you the hell of a life I've lived before. 
[38:21] Kabeer did so much to me.
[38:28] I was never happy in that house and now when I'm happy and I want to show the world, whats the objection in that?
[38:36] First there was Aaliya in that house. Everything was done according to her wish. I had no worth.
[38:43] I was insulted every time. And here, you have aunty. 
[38:46] I have no value. Alright, if she wants to cancel, do it. I'll be happy with whatever she wants.
[39:00] Why are you losing all hope, Falak?
[39:03] Why not Hamza? I thought you were different than Kabeer.
[39:07] You will say whats right. 
[39:10] You'll have separate values for everybody at home.
[39:15] You will be able to give people their rights to express what they want but I was wrong.
[39:23] Mom has a problem holding a reception at home.
[39:28]  I'll find a venue.
[39:32] So I think she'll not object.
