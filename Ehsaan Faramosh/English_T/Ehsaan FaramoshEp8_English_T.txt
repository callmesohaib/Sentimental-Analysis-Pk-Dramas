[01:16] I cannot live without you.
I don't trust you anymore, Hamza.
[01:22] You left me once and you could do it again.
[01:28] That's why I cannot marry you.
Listen to me, then.
[01:39] Nawal?
[02:00] If you're free, I came to ask when should we leave?
[02:04] You just wait. I'm coming.
Okay.
[02:13] Listen to me
[02:14] No. You listen to me. If you try to come close to me again, you'll see the worst of me.
[02:48] Why are you so beautiful?
[02:50] You scared me. Where were you, I was waiting for you since long.
[02:54] I'm so sorry. I was in a very important meeting. I came as soon as I got free.
[03:02] I have a call. Excuse me. Just a minute.
[03:09] Yes? Sister in law?
[03:12] I came for an important work.
[04:36] Look at her.
[05:03] Why is everyone looking at me like this? Is there something on my face?
[05:08] No mam. You have nothing on your face.
So?
[05:13] People are talking about you and boss in the office.
[05:20] What are people saying?
That you and boss have an affair.
[05:26] Why are they all talking nonsense? There is nothing between me and boss.
[05:33] Mam, after what happened last night and the way boss was holding your hand, whoever looks at it, will be mistaken.
[05:43] Who told you this?
[05:44] Everybody knows about this. Sara is spreading all these rumors with fun.
[06:04] Falak where were you? I've been looking for you.
Yes. I saw.
[06:10] You were restlessly searching for me.
You think its a joke. I almost died.
[06:17] I thought my world turned dark.
You love me so much?
[06:23] Do you doubt my love for you?
[06:27] Don't do this ever again. Come on now.
[06:36] Is this what you wanted? To make a spectacle out of me?
[06:42] What happened Nawal?
[06:43] How many times did I tell you to let our past stay buried?
[06:49] People are discussing us. Because you.. you didn't listen to me once. And now see.
[06:57] Everybody in the office knows now. I cannot face anyone. Everybody is eyeing me weirdly.
[07:06] Get a grip on yourself.
[07:08] Whatever happened was unintentional. Neither you, nor I wanted it to happen.
[07:16] And as it is, everybody has to find out one day.
What?
[07:23] You're still saying this?
[07:24] Yes. I'm saying this even now. Everybody had to find out sooner or later. Better now.
[07:33] I really like you and you like me.
[07:35] I'm warning you. I'm warning you. Don't say this to me again.
[07:42] I hate you. So much that words cannot express it.
[07:47] You insulted me in front of everyone and now you're declaring your love for me?
[07:54] Is this what love is? This might be love for you but not for me.
[07:59] People are looking at me with questioning eyes. How many people should I answer?
[08:03] Is this what you give me in return?
[08:07] You got me disrespected in front of everyone.
[08:11] I should have resigned on the first day. I made a mistake listening to you.
[08:19] Nawal.. You will do no such thing.
[08:30] Do you think you can stop me?
[08:36] After so much insult, I don't have any reason to stay here.
[09:02] If you're saying the people are good, then they must be good.
[09:06] See Sultana, we don't find such proposals everyday. You should talk to Nawal.
[09:11] She should listen to you because you're her mother.
[09:15] I talked to Nawal. She said she wanted some time.
[09:20] Falak is getting married before Nawal even when she's elder than her.
[09:23] Right now she's getting proposals but if more time passes, you'll regret listening to her.
[09:33] I'll try talking to her.
[09:36] See they have more proposals as well.
[09:39] This is a good proposal. The boy is an IT engineer, sensible and mature.
[09:46] The family is very small. His mother and a brother. Father is dead.
[09:51] They have their own house and they have more properties as well. What more do you want?
[09:58] Yes, you're right.
[10:00] I mentioned Nawal to them and they want a girl like her, sensible and well brought up.
[10:07] Sultana, they won't wait for long.
I'll try and talk to her.
[10:13] Nawal, how are you dear?
Hello.
[10:17] Hello. How's your job coming along?
[10:21] Absolutely fine. I'll just go and change.
[10:30] See Sultana, don't worry. Don't be anxious. They're a very good family. I can guarantee.
[10:37] They'll care for Nawal like their own.
[10:45] Alright. I'll leave now. I'll wait for you call
[10:49] I'll talk to Nawal and tell you. I hope she agrees.
[10:55] As God wills. Don't worry. Alright, bye.
Come.
[11:03] Welcome.
Why did you bring me to your house?
[11:07] Its not my house. Its your house. In fact its ours.
[11:13] But still it doesn't look good. Mom, sister Nawal, nobody knows anything.
[11:17] What will sister Aaliya think?
You worry about everyone.
[11:21] Nobody will think anything. Just relax. Come along now.
[11:30] Falak?
Oh, sister in law?
[11:34] Hello. How are you?
[11:36] Greetings! I'm good. I'm so happy to see you here. Kabeer I was just going to your room.
[11:42] I have to finish the setting. Its good that you're here. Come, we'll do it together.
[11:46] Don't change anything yet.
[11:49] But why? We don't have much time. We just have two days. We need to get things done.
[11:55] That's why I brought Falak. She'll tell how she wants the room set.
[12:02] What will I tell?
[12:04] But you said you want to set your room yourself, that's why I brought you here
[12:10] But Kabeer I was only joking.
[12:13] Whats there to joke about?
[12:15] But sister Aaliya is here. She'll decorate it for us.
[12:19] Its good that Kabeer brought you here. Its your room. You should set it yourself.
[12:26] What this? You decorated the entire house as you like and its beautiful, then why not our room?
[12:32] Because its your room and now you should set it as you like.
[12:36] You're here now. Go upstairs and see. I'll get you both tea.
[12:42] Thank you.
Come along. We need to get this done.
[13:01] Mom, is Arifa aunty gone?
[13:04] Yes dear, she left. Please sit, I want to talk to you.
[13:08] Yes tell me.
[13:11] Actually Arifa is asking about the proposal I mentioned to you.
[13:17] She's saying the family is very good. Now please tell me whether you want to accept it or not so that I can answer her.
[13:25] Its a good proposal and you'll have to get married some day.
[13:29] Whats the problem in accepting such a good proposal?
[13:36] See Nawal if you have anything in your heart, if you're anxious about anything, at least share with me.
[13:46] I have no objections. You can invite them.
[13:52] Really? Should I really invite them? I have your consent?
[14:01] You have lightened the burden on my heart.
[14:04] Arifa was telling me that they're very good people. Nawal will be very happy there.
[14:18] Are you sure, should I invite them tomorrow?
[14:21] Yes.
[14:27] I'll just..
[14:35] Thank God..
[15:22] I've not finished what I was saying yet.
[15:32] I want to send my mother to your house.
Sister?
[15:38] Sister, I'm so happy for you. Very happy.
[15:42] What happened? Why are you so happy for me?
[15:45] Mom told me you said yes to getting married. I'm so happy for you.
[15:49] Mom has invited the boy's family over tomorrow.
[15:54] Alright. Now keep your bags on the side.
[15:58] But I'm still upset. If you had agreed earlier, you would have been married before me.
[16:04] I had so many dreams. I wanted to do so much on your wedding. I wanted to enjoy your wedding.
[16:08] You will still enjoy. You will fulfill all your wishes, nobody will stop you.
[16:13] But I'm very happy for you. Really. I'll tell you something interesting. Sit here.
[16:22] Do you know, Kabeer took me home?
Home? For what?
[16:29] Actually he wanted me to decorate our room. He said I was free to decorate it as I liked.
[16:38] You went to Kabeer's house?
[16:40] Yes. You know sister Aaliya was doing it earlier but Kabeer told her not to. She was so embarrassed.
[16:47] No Kabeer did wrong. He shouldn't have done it.
[16:51] If she was setting the room, he should have let her do it. She's elder.
Even I was embarrassed.
[16:56] I told no to Kabeer but they said that since I would live there I should set my room as I liked.
[17:03] What could I say then.
[17:05] You should have said no. You should respect elders.
[17:09] You leave everything and see this. See what I brought. You'll like it. See this. How does it look?
[17:16] Its beautiful.
And this one as well.
[17:28] Whats the use of you coming over dear? We couldn't get done what I called you for.
[17:33] I talked to Hamza.
[17:36] He wants some time.
[17:39] Some time? Have you seen his age? How much time does he want?
[17:44] Ridiculous. What does this boy want?
[17:47] Mom, actually he likes his university fellow
[17:59] What? No. He never mentioned this to me. How could this be? Let him come. I'll talk to him.
[18:12] Yes? Hello Asad, How are you? What?
What happened?
[18:23] What happened to Naveen. Yes. I'm coming.
What happened?
[18:29] What happened dear? What?
[18:31] Mom Naveen fell down the stairs. She's not good. She's in emergency.
[18:40] What happened? Why are you crying?
Naveen fell down the stairs. She's in emergency.
[18:45] What? Where was brother Asad?
I don't know. Hamza get me a ticket to go back.
[18:51] Get mine as well. I'll go with her.
Yes, I'll just check.
[18:54] Come.
I'll go pack.
[19:06] Oh wow. Mom this is very pretty. See.
[19:11] They're looking good. These are pretty too. Look.
[19:23] This is very heavy mom.
[19:24] Yes it is heavy. My mother in law gave it to me. But you know I don't wear such heavy jewelry.
[19:31] Now since you have everything done now, I want to keep these for Nawal.
[19:38] Kabeer told me that they had made four gold sets.
[19:43] And we have two. Mom, don't you think its a bit less?
[19:48] No. You've already done enough. Two sets are enough.
[19:52] I don't want to burden you anymore.
Falak what are you saying?
[19:58] How many times earlier have I told you that daughters are never a burden on their parents.
[20:03] And when Kabeer had already told you they would be giving you four sets, you should have told me, we would have gotten 2 more.
[20:14] Mom if I knew you had these, I would have asked you to give me any one of these.
[20:19] I would then have something to remind me of you.
[20:31] I just got a little emotional.
[20:42] Alright, now do one thing. You keep this set.
[20:48] I didn't even think about it earlier or else I'd have given you this.
[20:52] No mom. This is for sister Nawal. I cannot take it.
[20:57] Oh Falak. We're not two separate people. When its time for my wedding, I'll get a new one.
[21:06] Falak, take this and don't talk much. Keep it safe in the cupboard now.
[21:11] Since you're insisting I'll keep it but mom I really don't want to.
[21:16] Stop it Falak and go keep it.
[21:21] Do you want all of us to cry? Now go and keep it in the cupboard.
[21:27] Thank you mom. Thank you so much. Thank you sister.
You're most welcome.
[21:32] I'll just go and keep it.
Keep it safe.
[21:43] Now you're emotional. You cry on every little thing.
[21:50] She's so emotional. I didn't even think about it.
[21:54] Listen, Arifa called. They'll come around 2pm tomorrow.
[21:58] See all the arrangements I've made and if anything is missing.
I'll see.
[23:31] Why did you have to be so formal?
[23:33] It doesn't look good to come to receive your daughter empty handed.
[23:36] Please come and sit.
Please sit dear.
[23:43] By the way, you people have been very formal. You're embarrassing me.
[23:49] Asjad thought this was still very less.
[23:52] No formalities aunty. Think of it as something that makes us happy.
[23:55] sister Arifa isn't here with you.
[23:58] I talked to her brother. She said she was busy with some emergency and she'd come around in a day or two
[24:04] Alright. So Asjad dear, what do you do?
[24:09] Uncle I'm a Master in IT and I'm working in a multinational company.
[24:13] All praise to the lord.
[24:16] Actually after Asjad's father's death, Asjad has taken over the entire responsibility of the house.
[24:23] He educated his brother, he looks after me. He looks after me and my son is a very responsible person.
[24:30] All praise to the lord.
[24:31] They're here and you're not ready yet.
I'm ready.
[24:35] Oh God. You should have worn something nice.
[24:39] Its fine. Whats wrong with it?
[24:42] Its fine but you need to darken your make up. Sit. Is this make up?
[24:50] Had I known you'd wear this earlier, I'd have come and fixed you up.
I look fine.
[24:58] Now you look nice. Do you know I saw the guy? He's very handsome.
[25:04] Yes mom told me.
Now lets go. Hurry up. Come one.
[25:10] A second..
No. Hurry up. Come on..
[25:41] This is my elder daughter Nawal and the younger one, Falak.
Come dear. Come sit with me.
[25:54] All praise to the lord. Your daughter is very pretty.
Thank you.
[25:59] We really like your daughter.
[26:10] Its all about fate. Asjad has cousins his age but Asjad wants to marry a girl who is well brought up and sensible.
[26:19] Thats why when I mentioned it to Arifa, she told us about you.
[26:23] Think of it as fate bringing us to your doorstep.
[26:32] Nawal has a job.
[26:35] We have no objections. She can work if she wants to after the wedding. We will have no objections.
[26:52] Please smile a little. I don't want Asjad to think you're not happy about the wedding.
[26:59] Your in laws seem to be very good natured people.
[27:03] Falak?
Yes mom.
[27:07] Get some refreshments with the tea. Go on.
Yes. Sure.
[27:18] Brother, Asjad is here in front of you.
[27:21] Ask him whatever you want to your satisfaction and then you can come over to the house whenever you want to.
[27:28] We have no objections about this proposal.
[27:30] Yes of course we'll visit your house, very soon. As God wills.
[28:33] Hello sir.
Hello.
[28:35] Sir this is Ms. Nawal's resignation.
[28:46] Call her in a day or two and tell her that I haven't accepted her resignation.
[28:53] Ask her to rejoin immediately.
Okay sir.
[28:58] And if she says no, tell her to fulfill her agreement because no employee can resign without completing their agreement.
[29:07] And those who don't follow the company rules, the company will sue them.
Okay sir.
[29:23] If that is how then so be it. I'll not let you go so easily.
[29:43] Whatever happened was unintentional. Neither you, nor I wanted it.
[29:48] But sooner or later everyone had to find out. Whether today or tomorrow, whats the difference?
[29:55] I like you very much and you like me too.
[30:14] Will you not ask me anything? People have a lot of concerns about their life partner.
[30:19] I do have concerns.
[30:22] But nobody is perfect. We have to accept them with their goods and bads.
[30:30] But I really liked your habit of respecting other people.
[30:37] You're exactly what Arifa aunty told us about you.
What did she tell you?
[30:43] That you're very mature and I like mature women because they know how to stick by their relationships.
[30:51] When I heard about you, I told mom that I'd marry you. Immediately.
[30:56] See the thing is I take everything I do, seriously.
[31:01] I work throughout the day and sometimes I come home at night or in the evening. So..
[31:06] Don't worry. I have a maid who cooks really well.
[31:11] And I make really good coffee. When you get back from work, we'll have dinner and then coffee together.
[31:21] Nawal, I like girls who are not dependent on other and live life on their own terms.
[31:29] Girls who make their own decisions. Like you.
[31:32] I like men who don't lie. Men who tell the truth.
[31:39] Lies make relationships weak. I don't have such bad habits.
[31:47] I liked meeting you.
[32:22] Whats going on mam?
[32:23] See I have received all the dresses I got made for Falak's wedding. Aren't they good?
[32:29] Oh wow.
[32:30] But sister in law, you can also ask Falak. What if she doesn't wear such clothes?
[32:35] Bridal dresses are like this. Do you remember hers? They were even heavier than these.
[32:39] Do you think I got everything without asking Falak's wishes?
[32:43] Don't worry. Falak bought all this she liked herself.
Oh so tell me that.
[32:52] Yes so did you get the wedding present?
Yes I did.
[32:58] So whats going on in the office. I'm completely out of touch.
[33:03] Yes all good. We have a meeting with the suppliers tomorrow.
[33:07] Sister in law, I was wondering if you could get some time and come to the office tomorrow. I have a few things to do.
[33:12] You have your wedding function tomorrow and you're going to work. Its the limit.
[33:18] Brother what can we do, our business is as such.
[33:20] The event is in the evening. We don't have much to do in the day so I'll come to the office. Don't worry.
[33:27] I swear both of you don't think anything else other than making money and your business 
[33:31] and I won't be surprised if you head to the office on your wedding day..
[33:57] I really liked those people and Asjad impressed me a lot. To be honest, men like him are hardly found in this age.
[34:05] You're right. I really liked their family. So Fariha, what did you think?
[34:11] Yes. There's no doubt about that.
[34:13] The family is really very nice.
[34:17] Alright then, once Falak is married, we'll immediately go to their house so that we can see where they live.
[34:24] What do you people think?
[34:26] Ask Nawal about her opinion as well. So dear, how did you find Asjad?
[34:34] You people are my elders. I'd accept whatever decision you make.
[34:39] Dear I really liked their family and even Sultana does so.
[34:44] Then once Falak is married, we'll go and see their house then and then we'll have a proper ceremony.
Alright.
[34:55] I just pray to God to give my daughters the best of fates.
Amen.
[36:59] Here sister. You should also eat this half eaten sweet so that you can also get married soon. Come on. Eat.
[37:06] Now Nawal will be married soon, for sure.
