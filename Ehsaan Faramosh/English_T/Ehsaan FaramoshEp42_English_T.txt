[01:16] Kabeer.. Sister Nawal had  called.
[01:19] She told me she gave you a cheque and you refused to take it.
[01:26] Yes. Because I don't want to take money from my wife's sister.
[01:31] Kabeer whats wrong with it?
[01:34] And if you can solve your problems with that cheque, you'll not have to sell the apartment at least.
[01:39] All this is in its place, Falak,
[01:42] but tell me why did you ask Nawal for help when I told you not to.
[01:49] Don't you know me? I've never begged anyone for money.
[01:55] She isn't giving you a charity. Its my right.
[01:58] Falak its not your right.
[02:01] If you want you can get anything from them after emotionally blackmailing them
[02:05] otherwise they have given you whats rightfully yours, getting you married.
[02:11] Kabeer I know you're doing all this to bother me.
[02:15] You know I don't want to go back to that house.
[02:18] You also know sister Aaliya will not tolerate me in that house.
[02:23] sister Aaliya didn't have a problem then.
[02:26] You were the one with the problem.
[02:30] What are you trying to say?
[02:31] Falak I simply want to say, I cannot rent a house,
[02:36] I don't have any money and I'll not take a loan from Nawal.
[02:40] Because my conscience will not tolerate this.
[02:58] Mom called.
[03:01] Actually Nazish isn't well. I'll have to go to Canada.
[03:08] I want to know your answer before I go.
[03:13] About what?
[03:15] Nawal you know well what I'm asking.
[03:18] Then you know my answer to that very well.
[03:23] Nawal please. Just think about it with a cool mind.
[03:30] I've thought about it.
[03:32] Why do you force me about it again and again?
[03:36] Have you ever been abroad? No. You have no idea about the lifestyle there.
[03:41] There's a huge difference between life here and there.
[03:44] I know there's a huge difference but I'd like to live here.
[03:48] Nawal please try to understand. If I stay here permanently, who'll look over the business there?
[03:53] Business. Business. Business. That's the only thing you think about.
[03:57] Have you ever thought whats here? I'm here.
[04:00] Our love is here. Where are the tall claims you made to me, now?
[04:05] You forced me so much when you came back.
[04:09] You ran after me, I didn't. You apologized and I only agreed after a long time.
[04:16] If you had to settle there, why did you come back, you should have settled there.
[04:20] Time changes the way people think. Whats wrong about it?
[04:25] I thought living here was good earlier but now I feel life there would be better. My business has a good scope there.
[04:33] Circumstances change. People don't.
[04:39] I feel you've changed.
Its not like that Nawal.
[05:10] Here's your tea.
Thank you.
[05:16] I'll look over it later. Give me the tea.
[05:20] Kabeer has sold the apartment.
[05:24] He's shifting here this weekend.
[05:28] What?
[05:30] And Falak has agreed?
No. She hasn't but she will.
[05:38] Kabeer was saying that Falak doesn't take care of Ilham.
[05:42] She's only going out all the time.
[05:45] What else do you expect?
[05:48] She left from here so that nobody could stop her there.
[05:53] Remember this. This woman isn't made for a house.
Touqeer..
[05:58] It doesn't look good on you to talk like this.
[06:01] Why doesn't it? She didn't value a loyal man like Kabeer.
[06:06] I can write it down that she'll suffer.
[06:11] Oh well, they're shifting again.
[06:15] We'll do what we need to do for them.
[06:21] When I told Hafsa that her uncle Kabeer was shifting here with Ilham, she was beyond happy.
[06:30] I know..
[06:59] I valued my dreams over human beings.
[07:03] Had I known that you weren't a part of my dreams when they turned to reality, I would have never chased them Nawal.
[07:09] I had everything and yet I was empty handed. I felt as if I had lost the most important thing in life.
[07:14] Can you not forgive me?
[07:19] A person's thoughts change with time. Whats wrong with it?
[07:22] Earlier I thought living here was a good idea.
[07:25] But now I think living there is better. Life is better there and I have good scope for business.
[07:45] Mam Nawal, please come and have dinner.
Has mom eaten?
[07:50] No. She didn't even have lunch.
[07:53] When I told her to eat or she would get sick, she said she didn't feel like. You also please ask her once.
[08:00] Alright, do one thing. Bring dinner for me and mom in mom's room.
[08:05] Alright, mam.
[08:13] Mom?
Yes?
[08:16] What happened, are you alright? Why aren't you eating?
[08:18] Its nothing. I just feel down. I have a headache.
[08:24] Mom, you have a high fever.
Wait a second.
[08:33] It seems you have high blood pressure.
[08:36] Are you not taking your medicines?
[08:49] You have 101 fever.
[08:51] I do take my medicine. I just miss it at times.
[08:57] Had you taken it regularly, will your blood pressure be high?
[09:02] I'm asking Zakia to serve dinner.
[09:06] What would you do if I'm not around?
[09:16] Hmm...
[09:19] See, there's a risk.
[09:23] You know my situation very well.
[09:26] I have no investment. Where will I get the investment from?
[09:30] See I know your company is in a loss
[09:34] and I know you have rumors spreading about you in the market. But you're my friend.
[09:39] And this is why I want you to be my partner.
[09:45] What if you back off later and if that happens, it will be a big problem for me.
[09:53] Don't worry.
[09:54] You just support me, I'm not the one to back out.
[09:59] How to manage everything, it will be my headache.
[10:04] Okay. But, where will we get the investment from?
[10:09] Of course, I will be investing.
[10:12] You'll just have to check over the management. You're already an expert in that.
[10:17] Don't worry about the money.
[10:23] Actually, Qaiser, see, I too, wanted to venture into a new business other than food.
[10:29] The way some of my friends landed my company into a crisis,
[10:36] had I invested in some other business, I might not have faced such difficult times.
[10:45] I would have survived.
[10:47] You know the first rule of business. Never put all your eggs in the same basket and that's the mistake I made.
[10:57] Now I'm trying to rectify my mistake.
[11:00] Kabeer that's why I'm asking you to join me.
[11:05] See, I will find a lot of partners in Pakistan but since I work out of Pakistan,
[11:10] I want a partner here who is trustworthy.
[11:15] And I will manage everything abroad.
You'll have to manage here in Pakistan.
[11:22] See Kabeer, this medicine company has been trying to put up a plant in Pakistan for the past six months.
[11:29] But unfortunately they haven't been successful.
[11:33] and Hamza also invested in this.
[11:38] I had to separate him because I now feel he's not interested in any business in Pakistan.
[11:46] And more over, Shirazi is behind this as well. He has been trying.
[12:01] Alright then. I'll see. I don't promise.
[12:07] See Kabeer.
[12:08] Tell me your final decision.
[12:10] If you're not joining me, I'll talk to someone else.
[12:16] But remember this. This is a golden opportunity for you.
[12:20] If you strike this deal, this will change your market reputation.
[12:32] Okay. Lets do it.
[12:36] Thank you.
[12:38] I'm sure, that you'll not be let down.
[12:42] As God wills.
[12:43] As God wills. I'll leave now. I'll call you in two days now.
[12:49] Fine.
Okay then. See you.
[13:12] Kabeer?
Yes sister?
[13:16] Do you know? Nawal called me.
[13:21] To be honest, turning her sincerity down doesn't seem the right thing.
[13:27] Even I don't feel right
[13:30] but what can we do? How can we take such a big amount as loan?
[13:34] What if we cannot return it?
[13:38] I have thought about it.
[13:44] Why shouldn't we ask Nawal to come on board as a stake holder? Invest.
[13:52] And if she does, its fine otherwise we'll say no then.
[14:01] Take your time. Think about it.
[14:21] Nawal if you become a shareholder and join us as a partner, then,
[14:29] we can take this money.
[14:32] Absolutely right.
[14:35] If you want to help us. Give my company your expertise.
[14:39] Yes but..
[14:41] how is this possible? I have no experience in the food and beverage industry.
[14:47] But you're an expert in finance.
[14:50] You can look after our finance department. Kabeer and I will handle the rest.
[14:55] Exactly.
[14:57] See you're investing. It'll be good for you to see everything for yourself.
[15:02] As it is, the company will benefit from your experience.
[15:07] See Nawal, if you don't join us, we'll not take the money from you.
[15:14] Now the decision is yours.
[15:32] Keep this too. Hurry up. We're getting late. Do we have everything?
[15:36] Yes almost.
[15:40] Alright. I've asked the maid. She'll not come from tomorrow.
[15:44] Why? Why did you say no to her? She handles Ilham, she'll come with us.
[15:49] We don't need her. We have so many servants there.
[15:53] As it is, Ilham is your responsibility. You don't do anything else. At least do this properly.
[16:01] You could say this without taunting as well.
[16:03] I'm just trying to make you understand.
[16:07] Another thing. Now that's we're going back. I don't want anything to embarrass me.
[16:14] Yes why not? I'll stick on a tape right away so that I'll be silent. Alright?
[16:21] Falak I'm just saying. Don't repeat what happened earlier.
[16:25] I'm not saying you're wrong
[16:28] but you shouldn't do anything to worry me.
[16:41] sister Aaliya is calling.
Hello?
[16:46] Yes we're done packing. Half of the things are in the car. We're leaving.
[16:50] Yes we'll come soon. Okay.
[16:55] Okay Falak, come fast. We are getting late
[17:02] All advises are just for me. My life will become hell again.
[17:10] You had a similar cot like Ilham's.
[17:14] The stars are beautifully. The blue one is especially beautiful.
[17:18] Really? Thank you.
[17:19] Mom, now that we have set the baby's room, so now,
[17:25] uncle will never leave us?
[17:27] Yes. Uncle is going to live here now. Are you happy?
[17:31] Yes. Mom, I will play with the baby. I'll give her my toys as well.
[17:39] When will uncle come?
He'll be here soon.
[17:43] Wait a little. Have some patience okay.
[17:46] But you need to promise me and dad.
[17:49] That you will not bother uncle, aunt and Ilham.
[17:54] Of course. I'm a good girl.
[17:56] You're a good girl. This is right.
[18:00] Sir Kabeer and mam Falak are here.
[18:02] Uncle's here. Lets go and get the baby..
[18:08] Come along. Welcome back. Its good to see you guys back here.
[18:18] Wow. Very nice.
[18:22] I am so happy that my house is complete once again.
[18:26] Uncle give Ilham to me so that I can play with her.
[18:30] Oh no. She'll fall down. She's quite small now
[18:36] How did you like everything?
[18:37] I loved it. Its very nice and I believe this must be your idea.
[18:46] Falak, I want you to clean your heart for me.
[18:55] I have never wanted bad for you. I've always prayed for your happiness.
[19:02] You people settle down. I'll get tea going. We'll have dinner together.
[19:09] Of course.
[19:10] Take care of the kids. Lets go.
Thank you.
[19:20] Falak? Didn't you like everything?
[19:25] Its good Kabeer. Whats special? Its okay.
[19:28] sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer are so happy. To tell you the truth, even I'm happy.
[19:34] I didn't know we would get such a good welcome.
[19:38] Its a good show off. They can fool you but not me.
[20:20] Nawal if you need anything or if you don't understand, ask me.
[20:24] Of course. If I need, I'll ask you.
[20:27] Look around the office this week, we'll start visiting the branches together next week.
[20:32] Sounds good. Done.
[20:34] I pray that your joining proves to be a blessing for all of us.
[20:39] Amen.
Come, I'll show you your room.
[20:41] Sure. Sure.
[20:51] Sir the medicine company we were working with, we have a mail from them.
[20:55] What is it?
[20:57] Sir they don't want to work with us. They have canceled the contract.
[21:03] What? But why?
[21:06] Sir, I've forwarded the mail to you.
[21:09] How can they cancel this contract?
[21:10] Sir they have objected that we haven't been working fast since the past six years.
[21:15] They say that we aren't serious with the project.
[21:19] We have invested millions and they now feel we are not sincere.
[21:24] Ask Mr. Qureshi to talk to them and get them to agree for the project. We'll lose millions.
[21:30] Alright sir. We'll talk.
[21:40] sister Aaliya?
[21:43] I have a good news.
Tell me.
[21:46] I am starting a new business with my friend Qaiser.
[21:50] What!
[21:51] What sort of a business? Whats the nature of the business? Kabeer you didn't tell me.
[21:56] Its a pharmaceutical business.
[21:58] I was thinking I should have another business alongside the food business.
[22:04] But I didn't get a chance, now that I have the chance,
[22:07] So I thought I'd make use of it.
[22:09] And the success I've received on the first step, I think I made the right decision.
[22:16] But, you were scammed one time earlier
[22:21] and the current situation in the market,
[22:27] circumstances aren't favorable and keeping everything in mind, I would suggest you not to take any risk.
[22:33] I know but don't worry at all.
[22:37] Actually Qaiser is a very good friend of mine.
[22:40] The company he works for, he's the country manager for that.
[22:44] He's the one investing. I will handle the management only.
[22:48] Don't you say that there's no time to start any particular business but once you start, that is the right time.
[22:59] And I've decided that I'll make the best of this opportunity.
[23:06] What if I regret later that I didn't avail the opportunity.
[23:10] I would have been successful otherwise.
[23:14] Kabeer, it seems easy right now but there will be problems in the future.
[23:21] That's why I'm warning you. Do whatever you want to do after thinking things through.
[23:27] There are about zero percent chances of failure.
[23:32] My friend is investing and I'm the share holder worth 50%.
[23:37] Okay. If you're so hopeful then its alright.
[23:42] Do however you feel fit.
[23:45] Thank you so much. Thank you.
[23:50] Good luck.
[23:52] Sir try to understand. There were some problems but they'll not come again.
[24:00] Sir please. Give us another chance.
[24:08] We will suffer a lot if this agreement is canceled.
[24:16] What?! How could you do this? 
[24:19] That man has no credibility in the market!
[24:22] This company is going to go bankrupt.
[24:30] What happened? What did he say?
[24:32] Sir, they don't want to continue the agreement with us.
[24:36] But why? Whats the problem? Everything was fine.
[24:40] Sir, we had slow progression since the past few months.
[24:43] Slower than the demand of the company.
[24:44] So what? We have problems. But this doesn't mean that we cancel the contract.
[24:50] Do one thing. Arrange a meeting for me with Qaiser. I'll talk to him myself.
[24:56] Sir, Mr. Qaiser has canceled the agreement himself and finalized the deal with Mr. Kabeer.
[25:03] What?
[25:08] No. That's impossible. This cannot be. You must be mistaken.
[25:13] Kabeer isn't in this business as well. He must have taken another name.
[25:17] No sir, he took Mr. Kabeer's name.
[25:19] And as far as I know, they're both old class fellows and best friends.
[25:26] Alright, get me a meeting with Qaiser and let me know.
[26:09] Sir, Mr. Qaiser is giving a time to meet after a week.
[26:13] He's doing everything deliberately. 
[26:16] He wants to compete with me. I'll not spare him.
[26:23] You go. I'll handle this.
Okay sir.
[26:32] I'll see how you'll strike this deal.
[26:52] What are you doing here?
[26:54] I didn't want to come but you forced me to come here.
[27:01] Whatever I did, I did in front of you. I didn't back stab you.
[27:07] If you want to be my enemy, don't back stab me. Confront me.
[27:14] Hamza I don't understand, what you're saying. What did I do?
[27:20] The medicine company you finalized a deal with.
[27:24] I'm talking about that. You knew very well I was working with that company.
[27:30]  I've invested millions.
[27:32] Right now backing off means a loss worth millions 
[27:36] and I won't let this happen.
[27:38] The company has canceled the contract with you Hamza.
[27:40] You got the contract canceled through your friend, Qaiser. Your class fellow.
[27:48] You used him to get this contract.
[27:53] I know everything myself.
[27:54] Hamza you told me yourself that you didn't want to work in Pakistan. 
[27:58] That's why I said yes to working with him.
[28:01] Otherwise I had no experience of that sort of a work.
[28:05] Really? Will you now tell me how to run a business?
[28:10] Where to invest and where not?
[28:12]  Will you dictate me? Are you even worth it?
[28:16] When you pulled out your shares from my company you told me yourself that you didn't want to work in Pakistan. 
[28:24] Now why are you all worked up?
[28:26] Its the last warning for you. Call off the deal.
[28:32] And if you don't?
Then?
[28:37] What will you do?
[28:41] I'll destroy you. 
[28:44] I'll bring you to a point that people will hold you as a symbol of trying to become enemies with Hamza Hashim.
[28:51] If we have friends like you, then we don't need any enemies. 
[28:57] The biggest mistake in my life was not recognizing you.
[29:03] You have so many grudges inside you that you destroyed a true relationship like friendship.
[29:10] If you had asked me with love, I would have called off the deal.
[29:17]  But now..
[29:19] Not now. I'll just compete with you now. 
[29:25] Do whatever you want to do.
[29:29] I will not cancel the deal now.
[29:35] You will suffer because of this.
[29:41] Remember this.
[30:01] What happened Ilham? Why are you crying?
[30:06] What happened?
[30:14] What happened why is she crying?
I don't know why she's crying.
[30:19] Can you please see?
[30:20] Media care... 
[30:22] Go and take her to her room and put her to sleep.
[30:29] Hello? Its good that you called.
I have a good news for you.
[30:34] You have been cast in a drama as the second lead.
Really?
[30:39] This is really a good news.
[30:41] Yes but the shoot begins in three days.
[30:43]  I have convinced the producer with a lot of difficulty.
[30:46] Its a negative character but you know how much margin a negative character has for acting. 
[30:51] Its a very strong character.
[30:53] This will boost your career.
[30:56] What are you saying Maria? Negative role for the first project. 
[31:00] This will type cast me as a negative character.
[31:03] Don't worry. Start your work for now. You'll get good characters in the future.
[31:11] Falak do one thing, come to the office tomorrow and sign the agreement.
[31:15] Give me time to think.
[31:18] You know Maria, my heart doesn't agree.
[31:20] Why do you worry Falak? I'm here. Trust me.
[31:27] Alright. You're right. I'll come.
[31:30] Now we're talking. Come to the office tomorrow and we'll meet. Okay. Bye.
[31:52] Write an email to the company owner and mention that their country manager, Qaiser,
[31:58] is favoring his relationship with Kabeer. They were class fellows and friends.
[32:06] And this Qaiser is a very biased man. 
[32:10] He deliberately presented a foul report about our company and got our contract canceled.
[32:16] We demand an investigation and if the company doesn't continue with our contract, 
[32:21] we need the invested capital back.
[32:25] And if this doesn't happen, we'll go to court.
[32:29] But sir the agreement clearly stated that if we didn't satisfy the company's requirements,
[32:35] the company could cancel the contract when it wanted to and we cannot sue them.
[32:42] What did I tell you?
[32:44] Go and get the email done. Don't tell me what to do.
Okay sir.
[32:54] You'll see what I'll do with you. You want to compete with me. I'll destroy you.
[33:06] What did I thought about that man and how he turned out to be? 
[33:11] He has such cheap thinking.
[33:13] He threatened to destroy you, only because you signed a contract?
[33:18] Do you know what the problem is?
[33:20] We think others are always mistaken and we are always right. He isn't looking within.
[33:29] Whatever he did with us and how he made us suffer, he isn't even thinking about it.
[33:36] How could you listen to his threats? 
[33:38] You should have called the security and threw him out. What does he think of himself?
[33:45] Trust me, I wanted to do the same but I respected the old connections we had.
[33:53] He is a very cheap man.
[33:57] But, don't worry. What could he do worst? 
[34:03] He will try to get your deal canceled.
[34:06] He cannot do anything else.
[34:08] No. No matter what happens, this deal will not be called off.
[34:17] If he's being stubborn, I'll be stubborn as well.
[34:30] Nawal why are you being stubborn? 
Listen to me. We'll be very happy.
[34:35] No Hamza. I will not accept this. You'll have to decide now.
[34:41] Decide what?
[34:42] If you have to settle abroad, you'll have to leave me.
[34:47] What? Are you in your senses Nawal? What are you saying?
[34:51] Exactly what you're hearing.
[34:54] I turned to you because I thought you had realized your mistake and you had changed.
[35:00] But I was mistaken. 
[35:03] You were the same person and I cannot spend my life with someone who worries more about his business than anybody else.
[35:11] You told me once that I had to chose between Shirazi and you. 
[35:16] Today I'm asking you to chose between your dream to live abroad or me?!
[35:24] Its your decision, Hamza.
[36:01] I have a meeting with Mr. Ehsan next week. I want to solve the issue with the rates.
[36:07] Okay.
[36:09] Please take the file and give it to the team and ask them to start with the visits.
[36:12] Okay sir.
[36:26] What happened? Why are you crying? Come here.
[36:28] Come here. Stop.. See I brought your milk. What happened?
[36:39] What happened? She has high fever.
[37:00] Hello?
Sir, Ilham isn't well. She has high fever.
[37:06] What? Where is Falak?
[37:07] She went outside. I called her so many times but she isn't receiving.
[37:12] Alright. If the fever is very high, keep a cold wash cloth on her head. 
[37:16] I'm coming in ten minutes.
[37:18] What happened?
[37:19] Ilham is very sick. Falak isn't home either.
[37:23]  I'm going home. I'll have to take her to the hospital.
[37:25] I'm coming with you.
Okay. Come.
[38:34] Doctor, how is my daughter now?
[38:36] The child has mild pneumonia. She is very weak.
[38:40] Are you the child's mother? You should know how to take care of her.
[38:44] No, she is her aunt.
[38:48] My daughter's mother is out for some work.
[38:50] Oh I'm sorry. I thought she was the mother.
[38:54] You have to take care of the child. I have prescribed some medicines.
[38:58]  Please get the medicines, the nurse will guide you.
[39:02] And you'll have to bring her for another check up after one week.
[39:04] Okay. Thank you.
[39:10] Nawal, thank you so much. Had you not been there, it would have been difficult for me to handle Ilham?
[39:15] Oh Kabeer, what are you saying?
[39:19] An aunt is like a mother to her niece. Ilham is my dear.
[39:26] I was worried more than you.
[39:30] But the one who should be worried doesn't even know.
