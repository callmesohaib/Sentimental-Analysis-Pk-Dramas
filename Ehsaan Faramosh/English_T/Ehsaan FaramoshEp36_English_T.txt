[01:07] These are a few things and medicines for Falak. Perhaps she forgot to bring them.
[01:15] We have everything Falak needs in this house and if we need something, we'll get it from the market.
[01:24] You didn't have to go through the trouble.
[01:26] It seems you're very upset.
[01:29] I'm very upset.
[01:33] How did you treat my dear daughter?
[01:37] You have wronged her so much. You should have cared a little.
[01:43] I don't know what she told you but nothing as such happened. Nobody harmed her.
[01:51] Is she lying then?
[01:53] Her upbringing isn't so. I didn't teach my daughters to lie.
[01:58] Please call Falak and ask her in front of me.
[02:03] If something happened, even I should know how we wronged her?
[02:07] Kabeer not only hit her but also threatened her with a divorce.
[02:14] What? What are you saying?
[02:18] I know Kabeer very well. He isn't a man to hit any woman.
[02:27] Either Falak is mistaken or she is lying. Kabeer isn't like this.
[02:35] Aliya, I have decided that Falak is going to stay here until the baby is born.
[02:41] I'll not risk sending her back.
[02:50] See...
[02:52] Daughters look good in their house. If we air the matter, its growing to grow severe.
[03:03] I tried to make Kabeer understand. Please make Falak understand as well.
[03:08] In fact call her here. I'll talk to her. She'll understand.
She's sleeping.
[03:19] Please pay my regards to her, when she wakes up.
[03:57] We have everything Falak needs in this house and if we need anything, we'll get from the market.
[04:05] How did you treat my dear child?
You wronged her. Nobody cared.
[04:31] What is it? Are you worried?
[04:39] No. Its just..
[04:42] No. You went to Sultana's house to give Falak's things.
[04:51] By the way, Kabeer was upset. He said he had asked you not to go.
[05:01] One of the partners has to bow down to save relationships.
[05:07] Kabeer might not understand this but I do.
[05:26] Kabeer?
Yes?
[05:31] Actually, I wanted to talk.
Yes, tell me.
[05:40] Should I talk to Kabeer about Falak?
[05:44] They're already drifting apart, what if this deepens the rift?
[05:50] What happened? What are you thinking? You were saying something.
[05:54] Yes. I was asking if I should get dinner served. Will you eat?
[06:02] No. I'm not hungry. I'll eat later.
Alright. Do let me know.
[06:22] Mom, why did you have to repeat everything in front of her?
[06:26] Aaliya now has a chance to turn Kabeer against me.
[06:31] Let her. I've told her clearly if this happens with my daughter, I'll not tolerate it.
[06:39] Falak, mom is right, we had to talk.
[06:42] Do you know what will happen after this? My life will become a living hell.
[06:47] They'll taunt me about everything. How will I live there?
[06:51] You don't have to go back until delivery. I'll not let you go.
[06:56] I cannot risk sending you back.
[06:59] I shouldn't have told you everything.
[07:03] Kabeer will detest me now
[07:06] If he doesn't care about you, why do you care about him?
[07:10] Because he's my husband and I have to spend my life with him.
[07:15] I came here thinking if I stayed here for a few days, Kabeer would realize his mistake.
[07:21] And then he'll let me live my life like I want.
[07:25] I don't understand why Kabeer is objecting.
[07:29] Nobody becomes as successful as you do. He should be happy for you.
[07:37] Don't you know Aaliya?
[07:39] She doesn't like anybody becoming her equal or crossing her.
[07:44] She never wanted me happy.
[07:47] She only wants herself to run the house.
[07:51] She wants me to sit at home.
[07:55] Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Don't worry.
[08:21] I object your clothing, your work and these people.
[08:27] I have objections.
[08:29] If you do this again, I will forget this relationship and I mean it.
[08:40] Even one mistake will make it worse. Remember this.
[08:57] Maria, I'm pregnant.
[08:59] Falak, its the start of your career and this problem. I must say you don't need this hassle.
[09:07] To be very frank, Falak, if you want to be in this field,
[09:12] you'll have clear off the mess. Focus on your career.
[09:38] I will not get an injection. I'll go home. I'm scared. I get scared.
[09:43] Look at me.
[09:44] No. I'll go home. I don't want this.
Please talk to me.
[09:53] I was going in my car. I don't know where you came from.
[09:57] Its all your fault. You did all this.
[10:04] I didn't know when you came in front of my car, just like you didn't know about the injection.
[10:23] Kabeer doesn't care about me
[10:25] If he doesn't care about you, why do you care about him?
[10:32] Everybody is living their lives so Falak, you should live your life too.
[10:47] It doesn't look good to talk but if we don't talk, things will get worse.
[10:58] I understand. Business matters cannot be ignored that's why I'm back. Please talk openly.
[11:08] This is the file with the details of all the expenses we've had.
[11:17] Hamza, if we cancel this deal, it won't be good for both of us. Not you, not us.
[11:29] If we suffered because of the fire in our branch,
[11:34] you have also suffered losses in the past few months because you didn't win a tender.
[11:42] And where we have expectations to gain profit, and if we call it off because of a personal grudge, it won't be profitable.
[12:00] Do you understand me?
[12:04] I understand.
[12:05] If you do, please don't cancel the deal. Its for the best of both our companies.
[12:14] But I cannot work with Shirazi.
[12:19] Yes if you can cancel the deal with Shirazi,
[12:24] I'll buy those shares as well.
[12:27] Hamza this isn't our company policy. This goes against our company policy.
[12:32] No share holder can hold shares more than 10%.
[12:37] See, Hamza if you don't want to work with Shirazi, we can do one thing.
[12:47] We will not let Shirazi be a member of the board of directors.
[12:53] We will only keep his contribution as a share holder
[12:57] and this will keep him away from all the policies and rules of the company.
[13:08] We will have to break a few of our company rules for you. We will do that.
[13:14] But please cooperate with us.
[13:17] We will take someone else on board after some time and get our shares back from Shirazi.
[13:27] You?
[13:30] Mr. Shirazi, you here?
[13:40] Please come, join us.
[13:43] I came for condolence you but I didn't know you three were here constructing a propaganda against me.
[13:51] See, keep your manners.
Hamza..
[13:56] So what did you say Mr. Kabeer? You'd have to break some rules?
[14:02] I'll break you now.
[14:14] I'll break you and tear you apart in the court.
[14:24] Mr. Shirazi. Please sit and we can talk.
[14:28] I've been requesting you to call a meeting for the board of directors
[14:32] and you, have been avoiding me to keep me away from company matters.
[14:43] This is cheating. I will sue you.
[14:48] What do you people think? Will I sell the shares so easily?
[14:53] Not at all. Now you'll see what I can do.
[14:57] I'll have a press conference tomorrow and after that you'll call a meeting of the board of directors and
[15:04] make me a member as well.
[15:17] Mr. Kabeer, the interesting thing is, you'll not have to break company rules for this.
[15:31] These people have discussed the same thing about you to me, whatever they told you about me.
[15:47] I'm telling the truth.
[15:51] Didn't you tell him how worried you were that he was interfering in company matters?
[16:00] You wanted to get shares back from Hamza
[16:04] because of his persistence and interference. Didn't you tell him?
[16:12] She was badmouthing you.
[16:26] I don't believe this that you people can do this.
[16:32] You people deceived me.
[16:35] You did so wrong.
[16:41] Whatever Shirazi said, I need an answer to that.
[16:45] Its not what you understand, Hamza.
[16:48] She's right Hamza.
[16:49] Really? Do I look stupid to you? Don't I understand?
[16:54] Mr. Shirazi is lying.
[17:04] I will think about your proposal.
[17:11] Please you can leave. Thank you.
[17:56] Hie Falak. You have a long life. I was thinking about you.
[18:02] Me?
[18:03] Yes. Another advertising agency wants to cast you. Right now I've told them no.
[18:10] But Falak I cannot say no again. You have to take a decision soon.
[18:15] I cannot reach a conclusion yet, Maria.
[18:18] The sooner you decide, the better for you, Falak.
[18:34] I don't understand. What will happen now?
[18:37] The most surprising thing is how did Shirazi reach Hamza's office?
[18:44] Think of it as our bad luck.
[18:50] But, don't worry.
[18:55] If Shirazi calls for a press conference, then?
[18:59] He won't. He knows that the press conference will incur him a loss.
[19:08] He's a big cheat, this Shirazi. We'll have to be careful.
[19:16] Hamza will not be on board now.
[19:19] We'll manage something.
[19:23] right now he's angry.
[19:28] But I'll talk to him myself.
[19:31] Whatever Shirazi did today, I think we have to sideline him or else he can damage us.
[19:47] I'll see what we need to do about it.
[19:50] Right now call the board of directors of a meeting and make Shirazi a member.
[19:59] So that he cannot take an action. Then we'll see what to do next.
[20:04] Alright.
[20:29] I feel bad for Nazish.
[20:32] Being a widow in such a young age, is a big upheaval. May God give her patience.
[20:40] Ameen
[20:45] Are you here alone or are Sofia and Nazish here as well?
[20:49] I'm alone here because I had important work in the office.
[20:53] Alright.
[20:56] Hamza even I was upset when I heard about Raheel's death.
[21:07] I'll get you medicine.
[21:11] Hamza I'm not well. I'll go and get some rest.
[21:16] Please have dinner before you leave.
Yes of course. Please rest.
[21:19] I'll just go and give her medicines.
[21:26] You must be thinking that I didn't call you.
[21:29] Actually I tried. I called two times but I didn't understand,
[21:36] its such a big loss. We cannot say anything.
Thank you Falak.
[21:46] Nazish must be worried.
[21:50] Hmm.
[21:51] Of course the pain is such. It'll take time to settle down.
[21:57] But she'll be fine by the will of God.
[22:00] She has such a nice brother and a loving mother.
[22:06] My prayers are with her.
[22:09] Say hello to Nazish from me and ask her from my side.
Sure.
[22:18] I'll leave now. I came to meet aunty.
[22:28] I'll leave, I'm getting late.
[22:30] Sit please, we haven't even talked yet.
[22:33] Some other day, I'm in a rush today.
[22:37] Alright. I'll see you out.
[22:50] Aunty seemed a little disturb.
[22:54] Yes. She is a little disturbed since a few days.
[23:00] I know why she's not well.
[23:04] Mothers cannot bear their daughters in even the littlest of pain.
[23:09] She's worried. Whatever happened, nobody had even thought about it.
[23:14] Raheel's accident delayed our wedding.
[23:19] You take care of her. She needs your care.
I know.
[23:26] We'll be back as soon as Nazish's mourning is over.
[23:29] This means you're not back permanently.
[23:31] No I'm here for a week.
[23:34] I have to look over the business there and Naveen has exams. I cannot be back before them.
[23:40] They need you. You should be with them.
[23:45] I'm trying to take care of them.
[23:48] Its so difficult to take care of people who took care of you all your life.
[23:59] You will care for them.
[24:01] I hope so.
[24:05] Shall I leave now?
[24:09] You take care of yourself.
[24:14] Bye.
Bye.
[24:47] Thank you.
I'll do it.
[25:02] Kabeer?
[25:05] Thank you.
[25:16] Kabeer?
[25:20] Yes.
[25:22] Did you talk to Falak?
[25:27] No.
[25:32] At least call and ask about her health. In fact call her back.
[25:40] It seems our house is lifeless since she left.
[25:50] She left with her will.
[25:54] She'll come back when she wants to.
[26:06] I will not go to bring her back.
[26:24] Can you not delay your flight? Can you stay back 2 days.
[26:29] If I could, I'd stay with you forever.
[26:32] But what can I do? Mom and my sister are there. Its important to go back.
[26:39] My heart sinks when I think about you leaving.
[26:43] I don't know this time it feels you'll not be back if you go.
[26:48] Why are you being stupid?
[26:51] Can I live without you?
[26:55] I promise you. I'll be back to you, soon.
[27:25] By the grace of God, you have a healthy baby. It will be difficult to abort.
[27:30] What do you mean?
[27:32] I mean its a long time now. Aborting is risky for your life.
[27:37] Had you come earlier, it would be possible but now its very risky.
[27:42] Doctor, I've told you my entire situation.
[27:46] I cannot afford this baby right now. My situation isn't feasible. Please try and understand.
[27:51] I can understand Falak but its not possible.
[27:56] I'm giving you a few medicines. Take them regularly. Take care of yourself.
[29:00] Are you looking for someone?
[29:03] Where is room number 106?
[29:05] This way.
Thank you so much.
[29:14] You called me?
Yes. Come sit.
[29:20] Have tea.
[29:22] Thank you.
[29:28] Kabeer I want to talk to you.
[29:33] What is going on between you and Falak?
[29:40] Aaliya must have told you.
[29:42] Yes Aaliya told me but I want to hear it from you.
[29:50] Actually we had an argument over her modeling.
[29:56] She wants to work but I don't want her to be in this field.
[29:59] Kabeer make her understand with love. Talk nicely.
[30:04] Aaliya was telling me that you threatened her with a divorce and its not done.
[30:10] I was angry. I know I shouldn't have said that.
[30:17] But tell me yourself, what should I do? I tried making her understand but she doesn't listen to me.
[30:24] Kabeer women only understand love.
[30:31] And you're about to be a father. You'll have a big responsibility.
[30:36] And you'll see. Once you have the baby. Falak will be busy.
[30:44] She will stop complaining
[30:47] Kabeer, see, the house is tensed because of your and Falak's argument.
[30:53] You're worried but so am I and Aaliya.
[30:58] This is important for us to live together peacefully in this house. Do you understand?
[31:12] Yes brother. I understand.
[31:15] Did you call Falak?
[31:19] Kabeer, call her and ask about her health.
[31:25] Do you know the sign of a good life partner is the fact
[31:32] that they don't stop caring even if they're upset with you. That's why go and call.
[31:42] I will.
[31:45] Have you tea, its getting cold.
[32:09] Did Aaliya tell Kabeer?
[32:13] What will she tell Kabeer? She wouldn't know why I went to the hospital.
[32:30] Even if she did, I'll tell her that I went to see a friend.
[32:36] Why am I worried? Why should I worry about Kabeer?
[32:59] Mom and I have been waiting for you. Don't you want to eat?
[33:08] You went for a checkup, why didn't you tell me?
[33:10] I didn't go. This is my friend's report.
[33:16] Why do you have your friend's report?
[33:22] She forgot in the car.
[33:24] Alright. What happened to your friend? Which friend?
[33:29] Why are you investigating everything? I'm famished and mom's waiting. Lets go.
[33:40] My heart sinks when I think about you leaving.
[33:43] This time it feels you'll not come back if you go.
[34:23] Haven't you slept?
[34:26] No. I couldn't sleep.
[34:31] I have my flight day after tomorrow. Just one more day.
[34:37] Don't remind me. I get upset thinking about it.
[34:43] What will I do without you?
Even I'm upset.
[34:48] I've never been this upset before I left.
[35:23] Will you come?
[35:25] I've been calling Falak. I called thrice. She isn't answering.
[35:30] She must be upset or angry with you.
[35:36] Shouldn't I be the one upset?
[35:40] Maybe you haven't understood a woman's psyche.
[35:43] A woman wants her husband to love her at all costs.
[35:49] You haven't called her even once since she left.
[35:55] How many times have I told you, she's expecting your child, you should meet her.
[36:02] If she isn't answering the call, go and meet her.
[36:07] Once she cools down, she'll be back.
[36:10] We have a meeting with Mr. Shirazi at 2pm.
[36:15] You can go and be back before that.
[36:19] Until then I'll go and handle things. Alright?
[36:39] Kabeer, you are a very sensible guy.
[36:45] I didn't expect this from you.
[36:49] You treated Falak very badly. She's hurt.
[36:54] I am embarrassed at my attitude
[36:58] and that's why I'm here to apologize. In fact I'll apologize to Falak as well.
[37:05] She's sleeping. She's worried.
[37:12] And yes, please sit, I'll wake her up.
[37:15] Its alright. Let her sleep. Tell her I was here when she wakes up.
[37:22] Kabeer, listen to me.
[37:25] She's expecting. She needs your love, your attention. Your care.
[37:33] I agree she is short tempered.
[37:37] But she isn't like that. She gets emotional and says everything. But she loves you and respects you.
[37:46] Even I love her.
[37:51] Whatever I said, I'm embarrassed about it, auntie. 
[37:55] But make Falak understand as well. 
[37:58] She reacts so much on the smallest things. She makes a mountain out of a molehill.
[38:05] Husband and wife have to compromise and Falak.. she never compromises.
[38:15] She has always been like this. Stubborn about everything.
[38:18] That's what I'm asking you to make her understand.
[38:22]  Especially make her understand to stop being stubborn about modeling.
[38:27] You tell me yourself, auntie. Is it good for her to model in this condition?
[38:32] No. This I realize.
[38:37] This isn't the right time. She needs her rest.
[38:40] Auntie, I worry about Falak. I worry about the child. That's why I'm saying no.
[38:46] She fought with me about it. She created a ruckus and things went through the roof.
[38:58] And I cannot tell you I was insulted so much in front of sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer.
[39:04] But when you didn't like her opting for such a profession, why did you allow her?
[39:11] You should have told her no, straightaway.
[39:15] If I say something, you'll think I'm being manipulative.
[39:21] What do you mean?
[39:22] I don't like Falak working in this field. I don't like her modeling.
