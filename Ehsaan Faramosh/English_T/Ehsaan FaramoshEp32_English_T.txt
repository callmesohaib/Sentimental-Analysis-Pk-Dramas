[00:12] I swear to God sister, how can I do this on my own?
[00:16] I took permission from Kabir before doing all that.
[00:19] But now he is pretending as if he doesn't know anything.
[00:21] Falak, haven't you lost your mind?
[00:25] Please keep quiet Kabir. Please keep quiet.
[00:30] Falak you are not a slave.
[00:32] You are beautiful by the grace of God and also well educated then why are you doing this slavery of your husband?
[00:40] Falak if I forbid you to go out alone then it is only because of that I am concerned about you.
[00:45] She praises Mr. Shirazi more than you.
[00:50] Talk to her. I don't think that she will resign from her job. She is so stubborn.
[01:04] I wish, I could see Hamza's face and his expression at this moment.
[01:12] He must be very angry and furious at the moment.
[01:14] Sir, Mr. Hamza Hashim wouldn't even imagine that we have bought this land.
[01:23] Now he wont be able to sleep for months just like I used to be sleepless a few months back.
[01:34] Get all other tenders as well at any cost.
[01:39] Yes sir, I understand. You don't have to worry at all.
[01:44] If we will get all tenders than Hamza Hashim wont be able to stand on his feet.
[01:50] And I will cause as much damage to Hamza as much he has caused me.
[01:57] And I will push him towards a dead end slowly and gradually.
[02:03] Sir, we have suffered a huge loss because of Hamza. All our clients refused to work with us.
[02:12] As you remember, we had lost all the tenders.
[02:18] Our company was about to become a defaulter.
[02:22] I will give that depression back to him which he gave to me.
[02:26] Sir you should give me credit of bringing miss Nawal in this company. I did a great job.
[02:34] This company is everything for me.
[02:37] I will do anything to make this company as number one company of this country even if I have to do anything for that.
[02:48] Do one thing. Hamza wants to bring a medicine company to Pakistan, talk to them.
[02:55] We will facilitate them.
[02:57] We will give them everything whatever then want like land, plant and labor.
[03:02] Talk to them and try to convince them.
[03:06] OK sir, as you wish.
[03:35] What's the matter Hamza? What are you thinking ever since you have come here?
[03:42] I had to buy a land.
[03:45] Everything was finalized but at the eleventh hour I got the news that land has bought by your boss Mr. Shirazi.
[03:55] You knew everything about that. Right?
[03:58] No, I didn't know about that. When did he bought that land?
[04:02] You are lying, You are senior manager of that company.
[04:06] Who else would know about that if you don't know?
[04:10] You knew that I was about to buy that land and you also knew that Mr. Shirazi will buy the same land.
[04:16] Why would I lie to you Hamza? What benefit will that give me?
[04:20] Neither you discussed this matter with me nor Mr. Shirazi.
[04:23] I was buying that land for medicine company.
[04:26] But your Mr. Shirazi bought that land by offering handsome amount. Do you know why?
[04:32] Because he can cause loss to me.
[04:36] This is just your thought. Mr. Shirazi can be your competitor but he is not that lowly that he spend millions of rupees to cause loss to you.
[04:46] Stop it, you all the times mention, Mr. Shirazi. I am sick of it.
[04:53] Nawal you are doing everything which is causing damage to me.
[04:58] Now my tolerance is getting finished.
[05:01] Whatever I try to do, Shirazi already knows about that.
[05:05] But Hamza, it is possible that someone from your company is giving information to Mr. Shirazi and leaking your secrets.
[05:12] If there is anyone in my company then I will find out. But you
[05:19] will have to decide by choosing either to resign or my companionship.
[05:25] Do you want your job or your love? Now, it's your decision.
[05:30] Hamza, why do you drag my job in every matter? We can discuss our matter without that.
[05:35] No we can't.
[05:38] You will have to decide.
[05:40] We will only get married only one condition and that is if you will resign from you job.
[05:47] If you wont resign from your job then I wont marry you.
[05:52] What? What have you just said?
I said, what you just heard.
[06:00] I don't believe this.
[06:04] Is this that easy to say or do this?
[06:08] Will you prefer your ego over our love?
Not me it's you.
[06:13] You are dragging your ego and stubbornness between our love.
[06:20] Keep your stubbornness away, our love will be in tact.
[06:28] And if I wont agree, then?
I have told you about my decision.
[06:33] Now, you will have to decide Nawal.
[07:10] Nawal, did Hamza come here? And what was that noise?
[07:20] Nawal, listen to me.
[07:35] Nawal.
[07:36] What happened? At least tell me something.
[07:40] How will I know if you will keep crying like this? Has Hamza said anything to you?
[07:46] He said that I will have to resign at any cost before marriage otherwise he will refuse to get married.
[07:55] He must have said that in anger, Nawal.
[07:58] Anyone can become emotional because of anger and say such things.
[08:02] How can he make such a big decision because of such a minor thing?
[08:05] And then he is enforcing that decision on me and forcing me to accept that decision.
[08:10] He is doing all of this before marriage then what will he do after marriage?
[08:16] Falak is right that he is treating me like a puppet who has no will.
[08:24] OK, don't you worry.
[08:28] I will talk to Mrs. Sophia. Everything will be alright my child.
[08:37] OK, stop crying now.
[08:47] Have a look at this Falak. It's beautiful.
Hmm. Beautiful.
[08:58] Kabir, I want some money for shopping of sister Nawal's marriage.
[09:04] Yes I forgot that you have to do shopping.
[09:09] I know, you didn't remember so I mentioned that.
[09:15] I am sorry. OK tell me, how much amount do you need?
[09:20] Give me one million at the moment, I will tell you if I will need anything else.
[09:28] One million rupees? Isn't one million a huge amount just for shopping?
[09:36] So what can I get in a hundred thousand rupees?
[09:39] A good dress is worth at least four to five lacs. And this is my sister's marriage, you know.
[09:45] If I will wear a good dress then everyone will praise you and say that she is Kabir's wife
[09:49] but if I will wear an ordinary one then people will taunt you. So it's up to you.
[09:57] What can I say? It's OK. I will instruct accountant tomorrow to transfer this amount to your account. Thank you.
[10:07] You are welcome.
[10:20] What happened Hamza? Is everything alright?
[10:23] Stop all this. This is very irritating for me.
[10:28] It's a happy occasion of your marriage my son so all of this will happen.
[10:32] But still, please stop all this noise.
[10:38] Hamza, what happened my child?
[10:43] What happened mama?
His mood is off.
[11:16] Hamza
[11:21] I am observing this attitude of yours since last so many days. What's the matter?
[11:26] I don't want to discuss anything about this with you. Please go from here.
[11:32] Hamza we are a family. If there is any issue then at least discuss with us.
[11:38] Look at me and tell if any thing has happened between you and Nawal?
[11:44] You can't avoid me like that. I am your elder sister and I know you very well.
[11:53] Earlier you were very passionate about your marriage and taking interest in every activity but today
[11:58] you have no interest in anything.
[12:02] Mom, is it possible to delay this marriage for few days?
[12:05] What? Have you gone mad? Are you crazy?
[12:11] Hamza what is going on in your mind?
[12:15] I don't want this marriage to get happened at the moment.
[12:25] Hamza tell us everything clearly.
[12:29] Is marriage a children play?
[12:33] One day we form and relation and next day break that. This doesn't happen.
[12:37] It's a very serious commitment. Two families are involved with each other.
[12:41] There are so many people involved in this matter.
[12:44] What are you thinking and what are you doing?
[12:48] It's my marriage so why are you forcing me if I don't want to marry?
[12:53] We are forcing him? The preparations have been made.
[12:58] What will say to people? What are you saying?
[13:04] It's our personal matter, you don't have to give explanation to anyone.
[13:09] Oh my God, mama I think he is not in his senses.
[13:13] Let's go leave him alone at the moment. I will talk to Nawal she will tell me everything.
[13:18] Leave him and come with me.
[13:26] This boy has made me worried.
[13:29] We took his proposal on his insistence to Mrs. Sultana's house. Nawal had refused to marry him strictly.
[13:34] We convinced her with so much difficulty.
[13:37] And now he is saying very calmly to cancel this marriage.
[13:40] He has gone mad. Is marriage a joke?
All family will make fun of us and taunt us as well.
[13:47] We will get humiliation. What is he thinking?
[13:50] Mom, don't you worry. We will go to Nawal's house and talk to her tomorrow.
[13:56] Until we wont find out the real thing we can't blame only one person.
[14:00] No, my child, I am sure that Hamza must have done something wrong.
[14:04] That poor girl is so cute. She talks with so much respect and good manners. She can't be wrong at all.
[14:11] Do one thing, call Nawal, maybe she tells you something. Let's see what she says?
[14:16] Mama, it's too late. It's not appropriate to call her at the moment.
[14:20] We will meet them tomorrow morning. Don't worry and take rest. OK. Let's see.
[14:59] Hello.
How are you sister Nawal?
[15:03] I am fine and how about you?
I am fine as well.
[15:07] I saw Hamza's car yesterday at your house. Did he come to meet you?
[15:12] Has the conflict get resolved between you two? I am so happy.
[15:17] What happened? Why are you quiet? Hasn't that conflict ended?
[15:21] Falak the matter has got more intense.
[15:25] Oh my God. Didn't you make Hamza understand?
[15:32] Hamza has clearly said that he wont marry me until I resign.
[15:38] What are you saying?
[15:41] Has Hamza said this to you?
Yes.
[15:44] It's the limit. Hamza is doing injustice to you.
[15:47] Didn't you try to make him understand?
[15:51] I have tried my best Falak but he isn't ready to listen and understand anything.
[15:58] Well, I haven't seen a selfish and egoistic person like Hamza ever.
[16:03] Do you know sister Nawal all men are alike.
[16:06] They consider woman like a puppet but you don't have to worry, me and mama are with you.
[16:14] You are not helpless. Don't worry at all.
[16:18] Falak I am unable to understand that what should I do?
[16:21] WHat do you mean by that? If I were in your place then I would straight away refuse to get married.
[16:25] If you accept one condition then he will force you accept everything in future.
[16:28] This doesn't happen. It is better to die alone instead of getting married to someone like him.
[16:34] Anyways, don't worry. I will come tomorrow then we will discuss about it. Bye.
[16:52] Mr. Shirazi I discussed with me team and we wont be able to offer you more than ten percent at this moment.
[17:02] Before you we were discussing with Mr. Omer Hayat and we locked the deal with them on ten percent share as well.
[17:14] Let's double the investment amount.
[17:16] I am ready to double the investment amount but I need fifteen percent shares.
[17:22] As I already said, this will not be possible for us.
[17:27] We have agreed to all other terms and conditions of yours so you accept this condition of ours.
[17:37] Well, what if I insist, then?
[17:42] Then I am sorry to say that we wont be able to lock this deal.
[17:48] Both me and Kabir are interested that you invest with us
[17:54] but if you can't do that or we can't finalize this deal because of any reason then
[18:02] we are in discussion with some other parties as well and we will take them on board.
[18:08] OK, give me some time. Let me discuss with my team as well and then let you know.
[18:17] Sure, take your time. It's your right to think about it.
[18:23] Do tell me about the outcome of your discussion with your team. I will be waiting for that.
[18:30] Thank you so much. Thank you.
[18:39] My child Hamza told us such a thing which worried us
[18:43] so we thought to come here and talk to you because we didn't feel appropriate to talk on phone.
[18:48] Well listen, just tell me correct thing whatever I ask you.
[18:53] Did Hamza discuss about marriage with you?
[18:58] Yes.
[19:01] What is he doing? My child you know him very well.
[19:06] He doesn't tell us anything but you should tell us about that.
[19:11] Such ups and downs are part of these relationships as you know.
[19:15] But it's very important to discuss and communicate.
[19:19] If we don't discuss with each other then difference are created and matter get more intense. Are you getting my point? Aren't you?
[19:28] Listen Nawal, tell us about the issue so that we know about that problem. Let me tell you.
[19:40] Hamza is insisting Nawal to resign from her job before marriage.
[19:46] What?
[19:53] And he is so intense in his ego that he has threatened her that he wont marry her.
[20:01] Tell me is this attitude appropriate in well educated and well mannered families?
[20:05] No, not at all. We all are very worried.
[20:08] The matter is so intense but both of us didn't even tell us anything.
[20:12] Aunt, actually the matter is not so big but Hamza is just misunderstanding the situation.
[20:16] Listen Nawal, if Hamza is insisting you to resign then do that.
[20:22] Because you don't need to continue your job after marriage.
[20:25] Sister you are not understanding the situation, Hamza has an issue with my boss Mr. Shirzi.
[20:30] He feels that Mr. Shirazi is using me against him and I am supporting Mr. Shirazi.
[20:37] There was a deal with Hamdani and Co. which Hamza didn't get and he feels that he didn't get that because of me.
[20:42] He says that I am causing loss to him. Do you think aunt that I will ever think bad about Hamza?
[20:48] No, my child you are not like that at all.
[20:51] He is definitely misunderstanding the situation. So please remove this misunderstanding.
[20:58] Now look, if he is forcing her so much before marriage then what will he do after marriage with her?
[21:04] No, my Hamza is not like that he loves Nawal so much and he will take good care of her.
[21:08] It's just because of a worry so because of that..
What's that worry?
[21:11] Husband and wife don't force each other to act according to their wishes.
[21:18] They move together in life.
[21:21] But Hamza, compromising is another thing, he is pressurizing Nawal
[21:27] and threatening her that he wont marry her. Is this appropriate?
[21:31] Tell me, at this moment when all preparations have been made and everyone knows about the function.
[21:38] He is talking about canceling the marriage.
[21:40] Both families will face so much humiliation. People will taunt us and what will we do?
[21:47] No, don't you worry that much. I don't know what are you thinking?
[21:51] That wont happen, I will make him understand and scold him.
[21:56] We are still alive. I apologize to you on his behalf.
[22:01] There will be nothing like that. Just get relax my child.
[22:13] I have got an offer for an advertisement. The shoot is next week in Dubai.
[22:19] What?
[22:21] Have you gone mad?
[22:31] I will have to admit your talent. It's your first shoot and that too in Dubai.
[22:38] You are my lucky charm. I am nothing without you.
[22:42] So sweet, thank you Falak.
[22:44] By the way, you are very down to earth Falak. I have given break to so many girls.
[22:50] But there mind goes to seventh sky as soon as they sign their first commercial.
[22:55] Yes, some people are thankless and they don't remember others' favor.
[23:02] But trust me, I am not like them.
OK, take it
[23:08] What's this?
This is your first commercial's payment in advance.
[23:17] Cheque of one million and that too for one commercial only. Are you joking?
[23:23] Yes, this is one commercial's payment and that is for two days.
[23:30] I have arranged this advance for you only.
[23:33] My God, cheque of one million. I don't believe it. My first cheque, thank you so much Maria.
[23:40] So believe it.
[23:42] This is just a beginning. Let's see what is ahead.
[23:46] Your flight is next week, get ready to fly. You have to touch the sky.
[23:53] Yes, but tickets, flight and hotel, how will all be arranged?
[23:57] Don't worry about that.
[23:59] This is the responsibility of traveling agency. That will handle everything.
[24:05] Take coffee, it's getting cold.
[24:08] I didn't remember because of excitement.
[24:13] I am feeling really sad Hamza that you are mistreating such a nice girl like that
[24:19] and pressurizing her to quit her job.
[24:22] How could you do this? How could you do this? You were not like that.
[24:28] You are sensible and broad minded.
[24:32] Yes I am doing this because I feel that she is doing wrong.
[24:36] Her boss is using her against me.
[24:39] There is no such thing Hamza, Nawal has told us everything. You have a misunderstanding.
[24:47] Shirazi didn't get a single contract since last one year and I was getting all contracts.
[24:52] So what has happened suddenly that he is getting all contracts? 
[24:56] They have intentionally offered this job to Nawal.
[25:01] Because he knows that he needs an insider to ruin me 
[25:07] and Nawal is an easy target for him to capitalize because Nawal knows inside details of our business.
[25:12] If we agree with you for a moment Hamza then how many other employees in the company along with Nawal
[25:18] who leave your company and they know the inside details as well so why don't you stop them?
[25:29] Accept it Hamza, we can't bound anyone like this.
[25:34] Everyone has his own will so why are you forcing your will on Nawal?
[25:40] I don't like her to do job there. Why don't both of you understand this at all?
[25:46] Hamza, my child, she is not a puppet.
[25:49] She is a living human being. She has some dreams and wishes
[25:54] and she has worked really hard to get to this point.
[25:57] Try to make her understand with love, she will understand.
[26:01] Mama is right Hamza.
[26:04] If you handle woman with love and care then she will accept everything you say.
[26:09] But if you forcefully want her to agree with you then she will break. 
[26:14] I tried to make her understand but she didn't understand.
[26:18] And what's wrong if I showed some strictness to her? I am her future husband. 
[26:23] It's my duty to advise her if she will take any wrong step.
[26:28] Hamza, my son, there is a way to advise someone, as you are discussing with us to stop this marriage, 
[26:37] have you discussed with her or not? We got so much embarrassment in front of Mrs. Sultana that I can't tell you.
[26:45] This is not the way, you are not married yet and this is your behavior? 
[26:50] If you wont change your ways of life then it will cause damage to you. You have to change your ways.
[26:57] I can't bear that Nawal do job in any other company and this is my final decision. 
[27:04] You can say this calmly as well.
[27:07] OK then, you make her understand. I don't have that much patience.
[27:12] I can't spoon feed her like children. Our marriage will be done only on one condition 
[27:17] when she will resign from this job and this is my final decision.
[27:22] Hamza don't be so stubborn.
[27:28] Nazish what do we do with him? Relationships don't form like that.
[27:37] Kabir
[27:39] I want to discuss something with you.
Yes what's up?
[27:45] I have got an offer of an advertisement and we have a shoot next week in Dubai. 
[27:51] What?
[27:53] Have you gone mad?
[27:56] Falak, you wont do anything like that.
[28:00]  I have forgotten everything which has happened earlier so just leave all this.
[28:04] Kabir, I have got this chance with so much difficulty. 
[28:06] And it's just a matter of a couple of days, what difference does it make?
 It's not a matter of couple of days.
[28:12] I don't like you to work in this field so you wont go there.
[28:18] You want to go to Dubai for two days and that too for a shoot and alone. 
[28:23] Not at all Falak I wont allow you at all for this.
[28:27] OK then, you go with me.
[28:31] Have you gone mad? 
[28:33] Please Kabir, I will do that advertisement and we will get the opportunity to spend time together. We will enjoy there please.
[28:40] I don't have any such intention at the moment.
[28:43] And you wont go as well. Have you seen your condition? 
[28:46] Traveling is not good in this condition for you.
[28:50] Where are your promises? You promised me before marriage that we will go on world tour together. 
[28:57] Where are your promises? I think you haven't remembered anything. 
[29:00] Falak I have remembered everything.
[29:02] I have remembered everything. 
[29:05] You know about business condition. You know what is going on.
[29:10] If I leave everything and go for outing in such condition then people will consider me a fool.
[29:23] OK fine, I understand that you are concerned about business but 
[29:27] you can allow me to go. Right?
 Falak please.
[29:34] I said that you wont go then you wont go. 
[29:37] And we wont discuss this topic again.
[29:45] Kabir
[30:02] Nawal
[30:05] When sister Sophia has said that you don't have to worry then why are you getting worried?
[30:12] She will talk to Hamza herself. 
[30:14] I know Hamza very well. He is so stubborn. He wont leave anything undone.
[30:24] Then it's up to you my child. It's a matter of your whole life. 
[30:31] Decide whatever you feel good for yourself.
[30:34] But think about it thoroughly so that you don't have to regret on anything.
[31:01] I feel that our deal will be finalized within this week with Mr. Shirazi.
[31:07] If that happens then our financial condition will get much better.
[31:14] Have they agreed on our terms and conditions sister?
 Yes.
[31:18] I have told him that we can only offer them ten percent share at the moment 
[31:25] since we have made Hamza share holder with ten percent shares.
[31:28] And we can offer him a maximum of ten percent shares. 
[31:31] He said that he will tell me after discussing with his team.
[31:35] I am sure that he will call me within a day or two. 
[31:39] Prepare all documents so that we can take signatures as soon as he gets agreed.
[31:46] By the way, if Mr. Shirazi accepts our proposal then it will be very good for us
[31:50]  and all rumors against us in the market will die on their own.
[31:55] After all Mr. Shirazi has a big name in business community.
[31:59] Yes you are absolutely right.
[32:03] Well, I have to go Islamabad for two days on day after tomorrow 
[32:08] so Kabir take care of business in my absence and Falak you will have to take care of home.
[32:15] Don't worry sister, I will manage everything. 
Islamabad?
[32:20] Is everything alright? 
[32:21] Yes, I have to go there for business matters. Actually two branches are going to open there so I will have to go there to look after work progress.
[32:28] OK
[32:32] I don't like you to work in this field. 
[32:35] I said that you wont go then you wont go. And we wont discuss this topic again.
[32:47] Falak, you are not taking your tea, it will get cold. Enjoy your tea.
[32:54] I am taking it. I was listening your discussion. Tea is very delicious.
[33:25] It's my career and I have made it with so much difficulty. 
[33:29] You can't force to give resign.
[33:32] I have worked really hard to achieve this point and I wont waste this opportunity because of any misunderstanding.
[33:43] You are right. She should agree with you. 
[33:46] She is about to become a wife of such a famous businessman so what's the point in doing job for few thousands, 
[33:51] but she became angry and said to me that I should mind my own business.
[33:57] You are getting jealous from my success. 
[33:59] You are feeling bad only because we are getting this contract instead of you.
[34:17] You will have to decide. What will you choose job or your love?
[34:22] It's your decision.
[34:28] We will only get married on one condition and that is when you resign from your job.
[34:56] You didn't allow me but no one asked from sister Aliya. 
[35:00] She is going alone as well so forbid her as well.
[35:05] Sister Aliya is going on a business trip and she often goes there.
[35:10] And for you kind information she is not going alone. Her whole team is with her. 
[35:16] I wasn't going alone as well Kabir. Maria and her team was going with me. Kabir it's just a matter of couple of days.
[35:23] Falak why are you insisting on thing again and again? 
[35:28] Why? I said once that you wont go so you wont go. That's it.
[35:34] And you condition is not appropriate to travel and I can't allow you to travel.
[35:38] What's wrong with my condition. Nothing has happened to me. I am absolutely fine.
[35:41]  Falak why don't you understand? Why are you insisting again and again?
[35:47] Because I also want to do something and it's matter of my career.
[35:51] Argument is not beneficial Falak.
[35:55] Aunt called me and asked me to send you there for few days. 
[36:00] Go there tomorrow and come back next morning.
[36:20] Sister, mama.
Hey Falak.
[36:23] How are you mama?
 I am fine. My child is here.
[36:28] How are you?
 I am fine. How about you? I am fine. Sit.
[36:32] Put here.
[36:34] Hey, so many bags? Is everything alright. 
Yes I have done so much shopping for you.
[36:40] Bring coffee for me.
[36:42] Sister Nawal, look at this.
[36:44] Look at this. Is this cute? Isn't it? Touch it. Isn't mama?
[36:48] And look at this mama.
[36:50] This one is for you. 
[36:53] Falak why did you spend so much money. I have already so many dresses.
[36:58] Why wouldn't I do that? It's my sister's wedding so it's my duty to do something for her. 
[37:04] Nawal is absolutely right.
[37:07] You did so much shopping, why did you put so much burden on yourself? 
[37:11] Don't you worry at all. I didn't do this from Kabir's money. I did it with my own money. Actually I got my first cheque.
[37:17] So I thought that my mom and my sister has first right on my first cheque. 
[37:22] First cheque?
[37:23] Yes, I did modeling so I got that cheque.
[37:27] Really, I felt that you just did that casually but I didn't have an idea that you want to do that professionally. 
[37:33] I did that casually but the response was so good that there is no harm in making that a profession.
[37:39] And what about Kabir?
I have talked to him. He has no issue with it.
[37:42] Well, it's really good. If he has no objection then what is better than this? 
[37:46] I am so happy for you Falak.
[37:49] Do you know, I got such a huge amount cheque of one million rupees. I didn't believe that I have got all that amount. 
[37:57] By the way sister used to give me gifts from her salary.
[38:00] So I thought to give gift to sister from my first salary.
[38:04]  No problem I am your sister.
[38:06] Even then.
[38:08] So, today's dinner is on me as well. We will go out for dinner. 
[38:11] No, no, you have already spent so much amount so don't spend anymore.
[38:15] It will happen, why wont it happen?
[38:18]  Nawal, Falak is insisting so much and she is so happy so let's celebrate that 
[38:22] and we haven't gone out for so many days so let's go.
[38:26] OK take your coffee then we will go. 
[38:30] Have a look at all of these things. 
Falak you have bought so much.
[38:39] Did you call me sir?
Yes, sit.
[38:48] This tender file belongs to Hamdani group's tender.
[38:55] And this is Shirazi group's tender file. 
[38:58] Look carefully at their quotation.
[39:07] It's a bit less than our quotation.
[39:13] Do you know what does this mean? 
No sir.
[39:17] It means that someone is leaking our information in this office.
