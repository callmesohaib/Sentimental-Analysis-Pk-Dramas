[00:12] You don't know Falak, she has a dual personality.
[00:18] She is different with you and different with us.
[00:21] I want everything between us to go back to the way it was.
[00:23] That's not possible. The distance between us cannot be covered.
[00:29] This is five years' worth of distance. Neither of us can cover it.
[00:35] Poor choice Kabir. You deserve a better life partner.
[00:38] You endured a great loss because of me.
[00:41] It's okay Falak, forget what happened.
[00:56] The boss hasn't been coming for a few days.
[00:58] We have an important meeting with the client and I want to discuss something with him.
[01:02] If it's that urgent, then why don't you call him?
[01:07] Excuse me...
[01:23] When you get married somewhere else, you'll see that I'll give up my life.
[01:30] I'll hit you. Is that something that you should say? Did you feel no shame saying that?
[01:37] Why are you getting upset?
Who says something like that?
[01:40] I won't do it again. Cheer up.
[01:44] I won't say it again.
[01:55] Ma'am...
Yes?
[01:58] Ma'am, the client is calling constantly, what should I say to them?
[02:16] Ask the boss's P.A to contact him and let him know.
[02:21] Okay ma'am
[02:39] After such a long time we three have sat down together to have tea.
[02:43] Yes, otherwise we're always in such a rush.
[02:47] That's why I left my phone in my room.
[02:49] It's good you did that.
[02:52] Falak, come sit.
[02:57] Should I have tea served for you?
No.
[03:00] Falak you're not well, you should have stayed in your room.
[03:04] I'm fine now, I felt anxious in my room alone.
[03:14] Brother... she's not well, I think I should either cancel the flight or have it extended.
[03:25] No... there's no need for that. I'm fine now. There's no weakness anymore.
[03:31] There's no point in canceling the tickets.
I think you two should leave.
[03:39] Once Falak leaves home, she'll have a different environment and she'll get better.
[03:45] I'm worried about her. It will be hard to take care of her if she gets unwell there.
[03:55] The entire game is falling on my head.
I agree with Kabir.
[04:01] I think you guys can go once she gets better.
[04:05] But our schedule will get tough by then.
[04:08] We have two projects to work on. The Dubai project is about to start with Hamza.
[04:14] We have back-to-back meetings with Umar Hayat. I think you two should go.
[04:22] I'm sure everything will be fine. Falak feels like going as well. You should go.
[04:30] Yes, Kabir, everything will be fine.
[04:36] Alright... if you guys are insisting then we should go.
[04:40] Sister is asking us to go and she never judges wrong.
[04:43] Alright then.
Enjoy yourselves.
[04:47] God willing everything will be alright. You guys will be back safe.
[04:50] Thank God.
[05:02] Have you guys kept everything? Are you forgetting anything?
[05:05] Have you guys kept your passport?
[05:07] I've kept everything.
Take care of yourselves and enjoy.
[05:13] Will you guys visit aunt Sultana and Nawal?
[05:15] Yes, we'll stay there for half an hour, then we'll leave.
[05:18] Don't take much time, it's an international time and you need to be there four hours prior, remember?
[05:23] Brother don't worry.
Don't forget to share your photos.
[05:31] When is the flight?
At four.
[05:34] We were on our way to the airport and decided to visit you guys.
Bless you.
[05:41] Falak, shall we leave? Please allow us to leave otherwise we'll be late.
Sure, safe travels.
[05:50] What should I buy for you two?
There's no need to buy anything for us.
[05:57] Why? I will buy you guys a gift. Message me what you want.
[06:02] Falak... when you want to gift someone, you don't ask them.
[06:08] Alright, mother bye...
[06:12] Be safe.
[06:16] Don't bother Kabir and don't shop too much.
Shopping is my right and that I will do.
[06:24] Indeed, I asked her to do a lot of shopping
[06:31] Mother...
[06:32] Mother... mother...
[06:51] She's bleeding...
Mother...
[07:00] We need to take her to the hospital.
[07:43] Nawal...
[07:45] Please control yourself, auntie will be alright.
[07:56] What did the doctor say?
Nothing yet, the treatment is ongoing.
[08:00] Nawal, what's the matter with you?
[08:09] Stop.
[08:13] She'll be alright, don't worry. Just keep praying.
[08:21] Doctor, is my mother alright? Is she conscious?
[08:27] There's nothing to worry about, she's conscious.
[08:34] Apart from the head injury, there's a slight gap in her knee.
[08:39] Because of this, she'll have trouble walking for a few days. She needs bed rest.
[08:44] But she'll get better, right?
[08:47] Don't worry, only a few therapy sessions and she'll be alright.
[08:52] It's not that big, thank God that this wasn't something dangerous, otherwise an injury at this age can be dangerous.
[08:59] Can I meet her, please?
[09:02] We're shifting her to a room, after that, you can meet her.
[09:07] Thank you, doctor.
[09:13] Thank God mother is fine. We should leave, we don't want us missing our flight.
[09:22] The flight is at five and it's four now, I don't think we'll make it.
[09:28] We still have an hour, we'll make it.
But in international flights...
[09:35] you need to be there at least 3 hours prior. It takes time to board.
[09:39] By the time you reach the airport it will be half past four and boarding will be closed.
[09:45] What does that mean?
[09:50] Meaning, that we can't go. Our flight will be gone by the time we reach there.
[09:58] I'll see how mother is.
[10:05] Kabir...
[10:07] Is our plan canceled, are we not going?
No Falak, we can't go.
[10:21] How are you feeling now? Did she sleep?
[10:25] I'm fine.
[10:28] But...
[10:30] I'm worried about your future.
[10:37] My dear, I want to see you smiling.
[10:41] I don't want you to live a lonely life.
[10:45] What's happened to my future, everything is fine.
[10:52] Besides... one has to lose something to gain something.
[10:57] It's not necessary that one gets what they want.
[11:02] I don't know about that. Give me Nawal's address, I'll go and talk to her.
[11:07] There's no need for that.
Don't stall, it's already been too late.
[11:14] I don't understand why you didn't tell me that you like her.
[11:20] There was nothing to tell.
[11:24] Don't say foolish things, Nazish has told me everything.
[11:28] I know the fight between you two, I'll go and talk to her.
[11:32] You're still asking for her address?
Yes, I'll go and talk to her mother.
[11:39] If you had told me this before, she would have been my daughter-in-law by now.
[11:44] We've wasted so much time.
I don't think you going there will do anything.
[11:54] Nawal has already been engaged.
[11:58] When?
[12:01] A few days ago.
[12:04] She engaged someone else?
[12:08] Yes...
And you've put a full stop on your life? Are you insane?
[12:13] What are you doing?
[12:27] Hamza!
[12:30] Enough of what you want, now you will listen to your mother.
[13:06] Mother... how are you feeling now?
[13:11] How are you feeling now?
[13:14] I'm better now, thank God... why did you come here?
[13:19] What are you saying? We were worried for you and praying for your well-being.
[13:24] Thank God that nothing big happened.
[13:34] Kabir, I'm so sorry, you guys missed your flight because of us.
You're embarrassing me by saying things like that.
[13:42] How could we have left you and your mother in this situation?
[13:54] This is what fate wanted. This was better for us.
[13:59] Please don't create a rush and let her rest.
Okay.
[14:08] Falak...
[14:09] Please don't get upset... she's been up since morning. Take her home to rest. I'll stay here,
[14:14] besides only one attendant is allowed.
[14:26] I feel stressed and dizzy. I was so scared and stressed because of my mother.
[14:32] Kabir, take me home.
[14:39] If you need anything, please call us.
[14:44] Thank you...
You've been so supportive.
[14:47] Don't worry... we're here.
[15:06] This is what one would call...
[15:09] an unpredictable situation. We packed for our flight...
[15:16] and we came back from the hospital.
[15:20] I'm not feeling well... I don't know how I'm controlling myself.
[15:27] I know you're upset because of your mother.
[15:30] And you're also worried because we couldn't catch our flight.
[15:33] But what could we have done?
We could have made it.
[15:38] I think you didn't intend on going... and you found an excuse to get out.
[15:43] What are you saying? We couldn't have made it. I think you haven't taken an international flight.
[15:50] On international flights, one has to board first and we were late.
[15:56] Whatever it may be... book the next flight after a few days.
[16:01] I won't unpack my stuff... I had such plans.
[16:05] Yes but Falak, we need to wait until auntie comes back from the hospital. Nawal might need our help.
[16:13] Why would she need us? We just came back from the hospital.
[16:16] Besides, sister Nawal has a habit of taking care of mother, she'll take care of her.
[16:22] Alright... whatever you think is right.
[16:27] Then promise me that you'll book a flight in the next few days.
[16:31] Don't you trust me?
[16:36] I do... more than myself.
That's the spirit.
[16:39] I'll get the tickets.
[16:45] Don't think too much and relax.
[17:04] Enough.
[17:07] You need to finish this... you need to take your medicine as well.
[17:10] Is Falak not here?
[17:12] She called... she said that she would come. She was asking about you.
[17:22] I feel sad...
[17:25] because of her, she couldn't go on her tour.
[17:29] She was so happy to go abroad.
[17:37] Don't take it to heart.
[17:40] Just get better.
[17:44] Listen... you have you finish your soup and take your medicine.
[17:48] I'm going to the office for a while, but I'll be back soon.
[17:52] Alright... don't worry about me. Go to work.
[17:57] If you need anything, tell Zakia. Don't move until I get back.
Sure, alright.
[18:20] Sir, may I come in?
[18:24] These designs have been sent to my ma'am Maria, she wants the interior of her new branch changed.
[18:29] Please take a look at it.
[18:30] I will take a look... but have you seen the customer reviews on our website?
[18:36] Yes sir... have you any idea how important customer reviews are for our business?
[18:41] Why aren't the restaurant's comment cards on my table for the past two days? Is this the reason?
[18:46] Get me the comment cards immediately and call a board meeting in an hour.
Okay, sir.
[19:05] Hello...
How are you, Nawal?
[19:09] I was upset because of mother the entire night.
[19:13] How's she feeling now?
[19:16] She's better, she's returned from the hospital.
[19:19] I didn't find the time... I'll come to visit her once I find the time.
[19:23] Where are you now?
[19:26] I'm leaving for work...
Alright...
[19:30] I wanted to talk to you... I was thinking of coming to your office to discuss it.
[19:37] Come home... We'll talk here and this way you can meet my mother.
[19:43] It will be hard for me to visit you at night. Don't worry, I won't take much time.
[19:47] Okay... I'll see you there.
[19:58] I'm disappointed that we've been getting complaints from our customers.
[20:03] Did you take any action on this?
Yes, I've warned the staff about this.
[20:07] Just a warning?
[20:09] You know that these customers are our foundations. How many times have we warned them?
[20:15] Three times?
Still, we're having complaints.
[20:19] Yes sir.
[20:21] You guys know why Kabir foods is successful.
[20:25] Because of our quality and the way that we take care of our customers.
[20:29] If the customers don't trust us, then how will the company be successful?
[20:37] Sad... sister, tell us what is your opinion?
[20:41] Should we change the staff?
[20:44] It's not an easy decision, I need to think.
[20:48] I want to tell you guys that Kabir and I have decided...
[20:54] that this year we will go to the Dubai expo. If we want to cement ourselves in the Dubai market...
[20:59] we won't find a better opportunity than this.
[21:04] That is a good decision. This will boost our company.
If God is willing.
[21:08] Farhan... I sent you the contact list in the morning to give to Mehreen. That was for the lineup for the Dubai meeting, what's the update?
[21:16] We haven't gotten an update... one I do, I'll inform you.
[21:19] I think you should put an ad for new staff hiring.
[21:23] Alright?
[21:27] There's are parks and restaurants for public meetings. Offices are there to work
[21:35] I thought you were my sister, but what did you do to me?
[21:49] Visit the site tomorrow and report to me.
[21:52] Nawal... Asjad is here to meet you, I've taken him to your office.
[21:56] Okay, thank you.
[22:06] Hello...
I'm so sorry... I was in a meeting.
[22:10] It's alright, I know you're busy. I wouldn't have come if it wasn't urgent.
[22:16] What will you have?
No need for formalities.
[22:24] What is so urgent?
[22:27] I need your help in regards to a job.
[22:34] What do you mean?
[22:37] I want you to try to get Asfar a job in your company.
[22:47] I've never recommended anyone.
[22:51] Nor do I think it's good.
[22:55] Ask Asfar to drop his CV, if there's potential, he'll get the job.
[23:00] It's almost impossible to get a good job without a good reference.
[23:06] Then find a job for him in your company. You can give your reference.
[23:12] Of course, I can...
[23:14] But I have an IT company, and he has an MBA.
[23:18]  I think he'll find better opportunities in your company.
[23:22] Asjad, I've told you that I've never used my reference for anyone.
[23:28] Then do it now... Afsar is deserving and I'm not being unjust.
[23:34] Who will we do it for if not for our family?
[23:38] Can't you do this to me?
[23:42] Sir...
[23:49] There's are parks and restaurants for public meetings. Offices are there to work
[24:01] It would be better if you kept your personal matters at home.
[24:06] Show efficiency in your work.
[24:09] Yes sir.
[24:14] I gave you a file to prepare...
[24:17] bring it to my room.
[24:20] Sure.
[24:27] Sorry, Asjad, you'll have to leave.
[24:46] Greetings*
You're back.
[24:51] Did you book the tickets?
[24:54] I'm so sorry, I couldn't find the time. I'll do it tomorrow.
[24:58] Kabir... it take two minutes to book it online. Why are you making excuses?
[25:03] How can I make excuses in front of you?
[25:08] We'll go there, I can't make you unhappy.
[25:11] Then book it right now...
[25:17] I've finalized the Dubai meeting. Tickets have been booked for the day after tomorrow.
[25:21] That's good!
[25:25] What do you mean? Are you guys going to Dubai?
Did you not tell her?
[25:31] Sister... I didn't plan on things being so quick.
[25:39] Falak, I'm so sorry. I don't think we can go on our honeymoon.
[25:44] We need to go to Dubai, it's important.
[25:47] But, you promised me Kabir that we would go to our Honeymoon. 
[25:50] What would I do here alone, if you leave?
[25:53] Why don't you take her? This way she'll get to visit Dubai.
[25:58] Great idea! Falak you should come with us.
[26:03] What will I do there? You guys will have meetings there.
[26:11] We won't be in meetings all the time. We'll find enough time to spend time together and enjoy.
[26:18] Sister... buy her a ticket, we'll go together.
[26:23] I'll do it right now.
Thank you!
[26:27] The tickets are booked. I don't want to go with you guys Kabir!
[26:31] But why?
Are you asking me that?
[26:35] You promised me that we'll go on our honeymoon? 
[26:38] Do my wishes and your promises hold no importance?
[26:43] Falak... you know that everything you say is important to me.
[26:48] But it's very important. I'm not refusing.
[26:53] We'll go to Dubai, have our meetings and see the sights. 
[26:57] When we come back, we'll go on our honeymoon.
[27:01] Why are you getting serious? I'll change and come back.
[27:20] Mr. Farhan, I wanted to request you to add one more ticket.
[27:28] I'll send you the details, do let me know.
[27:38] Falak.... what's the matter?
[27:42] Do you think you're smart? You think you're the elder of this house...
[27:46] You also showcase to take care of everyone, 
[27:50] so why are you so irresponsible when it comes to me?
[27:54] What do you mean? Husband and wife should go on a honeymoon, not a business tour, 
[27:58] are you so foolish that you don't know that?
[28:03] How are you talking to me?
You forced me to speak like this!
[28:08] Do you think I'm a doll that you can play with? Do you think I'll live my life according to you?
[28:17] You're wrong, you might be miss perfect, but you have no right over my life.
[28:24] I didn't do anything, nor have I thought to do anything like that.
[28:30] You convinced Kabir so easily, that you may have your business trip...
[28:36] Like I won't say anything... that I'll just happily go along with it..
[28:41] There's nothing wrong with it. I thought you would feel fresh once you come with us.
[28:47] Now I've learned how much you care about me. I know that you don't care about me.
[28:53] You care about your business trip more than me...
This is not true.
[28:58] Falak...
[29:00] I care about you.
[29:02] I thought you were my sister and look what you did to me...
[29:07] I want to go with my husband on my honeymoon... not some business trip.
[29:13] Falak...
[29:58] What's the matter Aliyah? Are you feeling okay?
[30:02] Yes... I'm fine...
[30:06] I just felt dizzy.
[30:10] You don't take care of yourself nowadays. You overwork yourself.
[30:16] Yes, it was a stressful day today. I'll go and change.
[30:23] You're okay, right?
Yeah, I'm good.
[30:44] Aliyah!
[30:47] Aliyah!
[31:06] What do you mean? Husband and wife should go on a honeymoon, not a business tour, 
[31:09] are you so foolish that you don't know that?
[31:14] Do you think I'm a doll that you can play with? Do you think I'll live my life according to you?
[31:22] You are wrong and you might be miss perfect...
[31:25] But you have no right over my life.
[31:40] Are you worried?
[31:44] I'm sure that this is business related, because I've never seen you so worried.
[31:49] Am I right?
[31:54] No.
[31:57] I don't know why...
[32:02] but today I have a bad feeling.
[32:05] What bad feelings?
[32:08] You know...
[32:12] how much I love Kabir...
[32:15]  I want everything in his life to be perfect. Like I want it for our life.
[32:21] But... I feel afraid that we might be disturbing his life.
[32:29] Because of us?
[32:33] Why would his life be disturbed by us? I don't see your point.
[32:42] Falak has a different mindset. She's very difficult to handle.
[32:51] Look, you took care of them. You treat Falak like a little sister.
[32:57] To be honest I don't think she has any problem in this house or you.
[33:04] By the way...
[33:07] Did something happen... did she say something to you?
[33:18] How I saw her today...
[33:21] if you had seen it yourself, you would have understood why I have this bad feeling.
[33:28] How was she?
[33:31] She was so arrogant and rude!
[33:37] She wanted to go on her honeymoon at all costs.
[33:42] She didn't...
[33:47] care about the official tour, even though she knew how important it was.
[33:54] Aliyah, please don't focus on it too much.
[34:03] Falak is a person who can have mood swings. She might be worried about her mother.
[34:12] You should have full faith in your love.
[34:16] You're right, it might be that she is worried because of her mother.
[34:21] But I've decided on one thing.
[34:23] I will...
[34:26] send Falak and Kabir on their honeymoon. I will finalize their tickets tomorrow.
[34:31] I don't want any confusion at home.
As you wish.
[34:36] I'm with you.
[34:41] Let's go... It's late, let's go sleep. Come.
[34:55] Miss, shall I have breakfast served for you?
[34:57] Yes, and call Hamza, and we'll have breakfast together.
[35:01] Greetings*
My dear, you have to come to Mrs. Hamdani's party with me tonight.
[35:09] Mother you know I don't like these parties.
Am I asking your opinion?
[35:16] I'm ordering you... You have to come with me. Be early today.
[35:23] Okay, mother... shall we have breakfast now?
[35:25] Come on.
[35:28] I don't know how you'll find a wife if you don't like socializing.
[35:41] Let me do this.
[35:45] Greetings*
[36:01] I've decided something, I'm going to Dubai alone.
[36:09] You're going with Falak on your honeymoon.
[36:15] What are you saying? You'll be burdened alone.
[36:20] How will you manage alone?
[36:22] I would... It's nothing new. I used to go alone before.
[36:30] Sister... it will be hard for you. How will you manage alone?
[36:35] Besides... Falak is coming with us, right?
[36:43] You guys will be busy in your meetings and she will be bored.
[36:50] It's not like that. She'll find the time to have fun, right?
[37:00] This is the time for you guys to have fun.
[37:05] Falak doesn't say anything in front of us, that doesn't mean...
[37:10] that we should enforce our decisions on her. She's a new bride...
[37:14] She has desires and we'll have a lot of time for our business.
[37:19] Right Falak?
[37:21] Whatever you think is right... I didn't have any problems before as well.
[37:26] Why didn't you have a problem?
[37:30] Falak... don't hesitate to say what you're feeling.
[37:35] Start preparing... I've called in to confirm the tickets.
[37:40] We'll get the tickets by tomorrow.
[37:48] That's fine... but since we decided yesterday that we'll all go together...
[37:55] Why the sudden change of plans?
[37:59] Now I understand that I can't have my way all the time.
[38:05] I need to take care of Falak's happiness as well.
[38:10] Sister... we're happy with your decision, we have no problem, right Falak?
[38:16] But since you've decided on this, I'll follow it.
[38:23] Falak eat something.
[38:52] What are you smiling at?
[38:55] Nagma's daughter, she's highly qualified... take a look.
[38:59] Did you like her?
She's alright
[39:02] She's lovely, don't you like her? Wait...
[39:07] I'll show you Farzanda's daughter. Look how gorgeous she is.
[39:15] I don't know, I've never seen her like that.
[39:18] Son...
[39:21] you have to marry someone. All your friends are married.
[39:24] You can't stay single. We have such lovely girls in our friends and family, I'm sure you must like some of them.
[39:32] I don't have anything like that in my mind. I feel uncomfortable when you say things like that.
[39:37] I'll tell you when I want to get married.
[40:10] Kabir...
[40:15] Did you say something to your sister-in-law?
[40:20] No... I didn't talk to her.
[40:24] Really...
[40:27] Then why was she saying that she can't have her way and that she needs to take care of your happiness?
[40:36] Maybe because she cares about everyone.
[40:41] Kabir, do you think I'll say anything like that to her? She's our elder and takes care of all of us.
[40:47] I wanted you to go to Dubai with her and ease her load, but I don't know what got into her head.
[40:56] Alright.
