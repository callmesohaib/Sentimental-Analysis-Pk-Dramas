[00:12] My husband spent money to build this house. 
[00:15] this house is made by his earnings & only I have the right on this house
[00:19] You have forcibly taken over.
[00:22] Mind your tongue. Mind it.. 
Toqueer 
[00:25] Toqeer don't argue with her. 
[00:28] Come with me.
[00:31] Where are you going inside? Go that way. That's where you go out from.
[00:39] Leave my office, now!
[00:43] Alright
[00:46] I'll see how long she works for you
[00:50] Hello? Can I talk to Falak? 
[00:54] Falak is busy shooting right now.
[00:57] What did you say?
[00:59]  Shoot?
[01:15] Falak
[01:17] Falak
[01:21] Falak!
[01:24] Falak
[01:26] coming... 
[01:32] what's with you Kabir, why are you shouting?
[01:35] what happened?
[01:39] did you came to office?
[01:41] yes?
[01:42] what have you said to sister Aliya?
[01:45] Nothing! What do I have to say to her?
[01:46] don't lie, Falak!
[01:48] whatever you have said & done over there, I have got to know everything
[01:53] what's wrong with you, Kabir. Why are you over-reacting a lot?
[01:56] you are saying as if God forbid I have said something very wrong or did something very wrong
[02:00] are you in your senses?
[02:02] what was the need for you to misbehave with her in the office?
[02:06] That is my office, I have a reputation there!
[02:08] Kabir, I have not said any such thing over there which can effect your honor
[02:12] you have talked so much of non-sense with her. You shouldn't have come to the office
[02:18] You are right! I am restricted to go out of this house. I am restricted for everything!
[02:22] I can't go anywhere! 
But she, she can go anywhere with you
[02:27] she goes to the office, for the lunches, dinners... everything is happening
[02:30] nobody asks her! there is no restriction on her
[02:35] what do you mean by this?
[02:39] I understand everything. I know everything!
[02:42] Kabir, it would be better for you to let me stay quiet. Its good for your & as well as for her honor
[02:48] what do you mean? What rubbish do you have in your heart?
[02:52] what are you trying to say, speak up!
[02:53] you won't be able to tolerate whatever I wanted to say
[02:56] all hell will break loose, if I will open my mouth
[03:03] What rubbish you are uttering?
[03:05] its not rubbish but reality
[03:07] She roams around with you at all times
[03:10] she doesn't give that much time to her husband the more she spends time with you!
[03:19] and you! You are always talking about sister Aliya... sister Aliya. Everyone knows about your relation
[03:25] its way too beyond than a relation of a brother-in-law with sister-in-law
[03:27] enough Falak!
[03:31] if you utter a single word now, then I will forget our relation
[03:38] you have already forgotten it long time ago. What is left now?
[03:41] Its hurting you a lot because I have said it to you now, you are unable to tolerate it!
[03:45] tomorrow when the entire society will speak about it then how will you stop them? How will you answer everyone?
[03:52] I send curse on you & on your bad and filthy thinking
[03:59] I don't want to keep any relation with such an abuser & low class thinking girl
[04:05] even I don't want to live with a guy who is more concerned about his sister-in-law more than his wife
[04:10] Falak! stay in your limits
[04:13] you & sister Aliya have crossed the limits
[04:15] Do whatever you guys want to do. 
But I am not a fool, I know everything!
[04:19] what is going on in between you guys & what relation you guys have!
[04:23] if you utter a single word now, then I will kill you Falak
[04:35] brother, she is like my mother
[04:38] and I have told her, I have told this to her on the first night of our marriage
[04:43] not like mother, but like a lover...
Falak!
[05:00] today, you have crossed all the limits Falak
[05:04] today you have broken our relation
[05:10] I, Kabir Salahuddin...  in my complete senses
[05:18] Kabir!
[05:20] divorce you... 
[05:32] I divorce you!
[05:43] I divorce you!
[06:25] what does she think of herself?
[06:29] won't I stay happy? Will I die without him?
[06:32] I will show them by living my life
[06:35] I will show them by staying happy & one day he will regret his decision
[06:59] I will never come back here
[07:05] what has happened, Toqeer!
[07:09] We had never wanted this to happen
[07:14] there is no happiness in life for the people who test relations with insensitivity
[07:22] As it is.. 
[07:26] what difference does it make by our consent or so
[07:30] Falak didn't think for a moment... 
[07:34] that what relation I & Kabir have. 
She had put such a bad allegation
[07:40] Kabir is like a small kid of this family
[07:43] He is precious to me like my own brother
[07:47] doesn't people's heart shake? Don't they have God fear?
[07:55] they forget that one day everyone has to die, what answer they'll give to God on the day of judgment
[08:05] i am feeling so ashamed
[08:12] how can she even think about such a disgusting thing?
[08:20] why are you blaming yourself?
[08:23] the way a fly sits on the garbage by leaving all the good things
[08:29] the same way, some people have such nature
[08:35] and unfortunately, Falak has the same nature
[08:48] you guys should be ashamed!
[08:50] whatever you guys did with me... finally you have achieved your goal
[08:55] you have separated me & Kabir. You have snatched my happiness from me
[09:00] you people will also never stay happy
[09:03] never!
[09:09] Handle her... now take care of her as well
[09:13] what are you doing? Have you gone mad?
[09:14] Why? what happened? Can't you handle her now?
[09:18] after all, you like to take care of everyone
[09:20] why are you taking out your hatred on this innocent kid?
[09:24] everyone says that I don't take care of her
[09:28] Fine, then you shall take care of her now
[09:35] Falak this is not right, don't do this
[09:38] I hate you, I hate Kabir.. and every member of this family
[09:42] that's why I am leaving her over here
[09:45] and if you cannot take care of her, then you can give her to anyone
[09:50] it doesn't make any difference to me
Falak!
[10:06] Hamza look, Kabir is a part of our family
[10:10] He required a finance manager, and then Falak also insisted so Nawal had joined
[10:16] if there is any confusion in between both of you about this matter, then clear it out
[10:22] aunty, I am angry upon the fact that she should have at least discussed it with me
[10:26] She didn't mentioned it at all
[10:29] Hamza, you were upset with me so I thought of telling you once your mood will be alright
[10:36] Ok tell me when is Ms. Sofia coming?
[10:39] I had a word with her, she said that she will come soon
[10:43] We'll fix the wedding date as soon as she comes back, we will not wait at all
[10:51] mom... sister Nawal!
[10:56] mom... 
[10:57] Falak... what happened?
[11:00] everything is finished mom!
[11:03] what is finished? at least say something
[11:05] Falak, what is finished? Tell me
[11:07] Kabir has divorced me
[11:15] what are you saying?
Falak!
[11:17] Falak, where is Ilham?
[11:18] He had snatched her from me. They took away my daughter from me
[11:22] what are you saying?
but why?
[11:26] mom, handle her
[11:28] my child, what had happened?
[11:30] they have ruined my life mom
they have snatched my daughter from me
[11:33] I kept pleading them, also I had begged Kabir but he had snatched my daughter from me. How will I live without her?
[11:40] how will I live now?
[11:47] aunty, I think we should go & talk to him right away
[11:50] how dare he to treat Falak like this?
[11:53] No! now mom will go & discuss everything
[11:57] She has a small baby. How can he separate a mother from her baby?
[12:01] how can he be so cruel?
[12:04] aunty, you should file a report in the police. Get him arrested
[12:09] but why Falak, why he did this?
[12:11] because of sister Aliya!
[12:13] that woman had filled Kabir's ears, and Kabir didn't listened to me at all
[12:17] I kept telling you guys to go & talk to them. Ask them about their cruelties & injustices but nobody had gone there
[12:25] have patience my dear, everything will be fine
[12:29] aunty, if Falak was telling you guys then you should have gone there. Why didn't you go?
[12:34] and Nawal you! You didn't even mentioned these matters to me
[12:38] if we had broken his face at that time, then he wouldn't have got the courage to do this today
[12:42] Falak! Nawal, take her inside the room. Make her do the rest
[12:45] come
[12:45] go dear go, go inside the room
[12:47] aunty, listen to me. Lets go to their house right away & talk to them. Please
[12:53] No mom, there is no use of talking now
sister, take me to the room
[12:57] come on
[12:58] there is no need to do anything
come on
[13:07] Oh God, what had happened with my daughter
[13:19] I didn't had an idea that a mother can be so insensitive
[13:26] what else can be expected from Falak?
[13:34] to leave your own daughter like this..
[13:39] there is so much of poison in her heart
[13:42] I don't believe it
[13:44] she is such an innocent soul...
[14:07] I am restricted to go out of this house. I am restricted for everything!
[14:10] I can't go anywhere! 
But she, she can go anywhere with you
[14:14] she goes to the office, for the lunches, dinners... everything is happening
[14:17] nobody asks her! there is no restriction on her
[14:21] She roams around with you at all times
[14:24] she doesn't give that much time to her husband the more she spends time with you!
[14:28] and you! You are always talking about sister Aliya... sister Aliya. Everyone knows about your relation
[14:33] its way too beyond than a relation of a brother-in-law with sister-in-law
[14:37] Its hurting you a lot because I have said it to you now, you are unable to tolerate it!
[14:41] tomorrow when the entire society will speak about it then how will you stop them? How will you answer everyone?
[15:11] even I don't want to live with a guy who is more concerned about his sister-in-law more than his wife
[15:16] Do whatever you guys want to do. 
But I am not a fool, I know everything!
[15:32] Sakina! Noor!
[15:41] yes sir
[15:43] today on wards, I shouldn't see anything related to Falak in this room
[15:47] whatever is her belongings in this room, throw them outside!
[15:50] Okay sir
[16:01] aunty & you should go to talk to them
[16:04] Hamza, its quite late night now. It won't be right to go at this hour
[16:07] whatever will happen now, will happen in the day time tomorrow
[16:09] have you seen her condition? how she was swerving. She has a small baby, how will she spend the entire night?
[16:18] so much of cruelty on a weak girl. How can he do such a disgusting act?
[16:23] I can't believe that he did this disgusting act, although he is highly educated
[16:29] I am feeling so angry on him, I feel like breaking his face right away but I am quiet because of you guys
[16:36] Nawal, listen to me. Go & file an FIR against him, get him arrested
[16:41] wherever you need my help, I am there for you
[16:43] Thank you! I appreciate it. But now mom will go & talk to them tomorrow
[16:48] then we'll see what will happen next
[16:51] but you people will not forgive him at any cost
[16:54] there is no need to be afraid of anyone, I am with you guys. Ok?
[16:59] Come, I'll see you off. Come on
[17:06] Ilhaam...
[17:17] Kabir
[17:18] yes sister
[17:20] she hasn't slept as of yet? Give her to me, you have to go to the office tomorrow morning
[17:24] You haven't eaten anything as well, give her to me
[17:26] She was crying since so long, just now she got quiet with a lot of difficulty
[17:30] Come to me my dear...
[17:34] rest for some time
[17:35] please change & take care
[17:49] brother, she is like my mother
[17:51] and I have told her, I have told this to her on the first night of our marriage
[17:55] not like mother, but like a lover...
Falak!
[18:46] mom, you are still awake
[18:51] also you are crying. If Falak will see you like this, then how will she get the strength?
[18:57] how will I give her strength, Nawal?
[19:03] my own strength has ended, my child...
[19:09] how will she spend such a long life? 
Such an oppression is done on her
[19:18] where is she? Has she slept?
[19:21] She had slept with a lot of difficulty, after taking the medicine
[19:30] one day my God will take the revenge of every oppression
[19:35] They did so much of injustice with my Falak, I will never forgive them
[19:47] how they have annoyed my such a delicate daughter
[19:56] ,I will take Ilham with me, I will see that who will stop me
[19:59] I will stop you!
[20:02] She is my daughter, you cannot take her like that
[20:22] get up my dear, come on & have some food. You haven't eaten anything since last night
[20:28] I don't feel like doing anything
[20:30] Falak, please eat something
[20:32] you will get sick if you'll stay hungry. Come on, eat something
[20:38] have patience, my dear
[20:40] he was a poor-spirited guy. He didn't valued your love
[20:44] but the people who doesn't value such kind of love, they spend their entire life in pain & difficulties
[20:53] stop shedding your tears for him, its enough!
[20:56] no matter how much I make myself understand
[21:01] or try to make myself believe
[21:05] but my heart doesn't agrees
[21:08] that Kabir didn't took a second to make me a stranger
[21:13] He had finished everything in a moment
[21:15] mom, is this relation so weak?
[21:18] no relation is so weak
[21:21] its all about feelings
[21:23] when feelings die, then relations also gets finished
[21:29] Nawal & I will go there to talk to them. I will tell them that you are not an orphan
[21:40] No mom, there is no need to go there
[21:43] We have no relation or concern with that house or family anymore
[21:48] but Falak...
No sister, swear upon my life
[21:52] ensure me that you will not take mom over there
[21:56] I will go there for sure
[21:58] I haven't given them my daughter so that they can treat her like this!
[22:03] No mom please, let it be. For my sake...
he has to answer me
[22:09] I won't spare Kabir. I will go there myself to talk!
[22:44] maam, Ms. Sultana is here. She is calling you
[22:55] Okay, come to her. Let me see
[22:58] I am coming in a while, Ok?
[23:08] how come you are here?
[23:10] I came to talk to you, Aliya
[23:13] you shouldn't have come after whatever your daughter did, but still...
[23:19] please sit, tell me whatever you want to say
[23:21] what were you thinking?
[23:25] is she an orphan? And nobody will come to inquire anything?
[23:28] I had given you my daughter by thinking that you people are literate enough & will take care of my daughter
[23:34] but this...
[23:37] is this how you guys have treated her? Worse than illiterates?
[23:42] I wasn't expecting this
[23:44] nobody has said anything to your daughter
[23:47] in fact, we have tried to take care of her by all means
[23:50] but she is quite an ungrateful person!
[23:53] in the middle of the night...
[23:55] ousting her from the house, after divorcing her & snatching away her daughter. Do you guys call this care?
[24:02] nothing as such has happened
[24:04] neither anyone has snatched away Ilham from her, nor anyone had pushed or ousted her from the house
[24:09] it would have been better for you to question your daughter before coming here & accusing us
[24:16] we haven't snatched Ilham, instead Falak had left her on her own
[24:19] oh! how come a mother leave her dearest piece of heart over here. There is no point in it
[24:28] my daughter doesn't lie, and neither its in my upbringing
[24:35] you are so proud of your upbringing, right?
[24:38] do you know, what your daughter did?
[24:40] your daughter has put a false allegation on me & sister Aliya
[24:44] She has raised her finger on our relation
[24:51] She has put such a bad & disgusting allegations
[24:54] is this your upbringing? Is this what you have taught your daughter?
[24:59] you are lying!
[25:01] my Falak is not like that
[25:02] I am not lying
[25:04] Falak is like this, insensitive & cruel
[25:10] even we used to think this way earlier
[25:12] but whatever non-sense Falak had uttered
[25:15] after that, I feel like the ground shall burst open & I shall get buried in it
[25:20] I am unable to face myself
[25:25] See, whether you want to believe us then do it. If not then don't
[25:29] but whatever the truth was, we have told you
[25:32] Its all your drama...
[25:35] you are lying & putting false allegations on my daughter, in order to hide the truth
[25:40] Falak has told me clearly that you have provoked Kabir. Kabir has divorced her because you have provoked him
[25:47] we aren't putting a false allegation
[25:50] it was Falak who had put a false allegation
[25:53] She had misbehaved so many times earlier as well
[25:56] if I had to provoke, then I would have done it at that time
[25:59] she gave me thousands of chances, to separate them
[26:02] if I had to separate them then I would have done it at that time. But I am not among those people
[26:08] you haven't done the right thing, Kabir
[26:10] You could have thought for once before taking such a big decision
[26:15] if not about Falak, then at least you should have thought about Ilham
[26:18] Do you have any idea, that how the children from the broken family survives?
[26:24] its not right
[26:29] maam, Ilham is crying a lot
[26:32] take her inside, I am coming
[26:34] Wait!
[26:36] I will take Ilham with me
[26:41] Falak had left her over here on her own
[26:44] on what reason you are taking her?
[26:46] if she had to take her along, then she would have taken her at that time
[26:49] you people are lying!
[26:53] you people have snatched the baby from Falak
[26:55] She didn't left her daughter. Don't you feel ashamed while telling a lie?
[26:59] and she told you all this, right?
[27:02] My God! how can somebody tell so many lies? I have never seen anyone telling so many lies
[27:10] it would be better for you not to take her along
[27:13] She had left her like an orphan
[27:16] but now, I won't even let her shadow affect on my daughter
[27:20] I will take Ilham with me, I will see that who will stop me
[27:23] I will stop you!
[27:25] She is my daughter, you cannot take her like that
[27:29] I will file a report against you people
[27:32] I will take the revenge of your oppression, I won't spare you!
[27:35] I will file a case against you guys
[27:38] what do you guys think, there is nobody to question? 
Will I stay quiet?
[27:42] do whatever you want to do
I don't care!
[27:46] but I won't let you take away my daughter
[27:49] let her go, Kabir
[27:52] its alright
[27:53] don't repeat the same mistake that Falak did
[27:57] the love a mother can give her daughter, nobody else can give that
[28:01] sister, what are you saying?
[28:03] She had left her in front of you
[28:06] and what she had said, take care of her if you want to otherwise give her away to someone!
[28:11] is my daughter an orphan?
[28:13] maybe her mother is dead, but her father is still alive
[28:17] as I said, don't stop her
[28:19] We aren't so cruel, Kabir
[28:45] mom, where have you been? I was calling you since so long
[28:48] what had happen?
[28:50] oh God, thanks to you!
[28:52] I was missing her a lot
[28:55] thank God she is here
[28:57] but Aliya was saying that you had left her over there yourself
[29:02] they are lying, mom!
[29:04] Kabir had snatched her away from me
[29:06] also he had threatened me that if I will utter a word then he won't let me see my daughter's face for lifetime
[29:13] is this true that you had put a false allegation on Kabir & Aliya?
[29:18] they are lying, mom!
[29:20] what are you saying?
[29:22] I haven't put any false allegation
[29:24] But... Kabir & Aliya were saying that you had put a false allegation on them
[29:30] you had doubted their relation...
[29:32] and due to this reason Kabir has divorced you in anger
[29:35] what kind of people they are! So diplomatic!
[29:38] why would I say this, mom? Am I mad or a kid?
[29:41] how will I put a false allegation?
[29:43] I had understood it earlier, that they are lying
[29:47] I completely trust my daughter, and my upbringing
[29:51] She can never utter such an inappropriate words
[29:55] why do they need to lie, mom?
[29:58] why will any person make such a big decision without any reason?
[30:03] so you think I am lying?
[30:05] Falak look, I don't know whether you are lying or not. But your behavior with Aliya is way too bad
[30:12] the way you have misbehaved with her in the office, I have seen everything
[30:17] and for sure, you must have said something after going to your house
[30:20] mom, did you hear her? Only this was left to be heard
[30:24] why will I lie?
[30:26] You do believe on Kabir's words, but the way your sister is crying & telling everything. You don't believe her
[30:31] it doesn't have any importance?
[30:32] Falak, whomsoever I will find wrong. I will say it wrong
[30:35] then whether its you or someone else
[30:37] but don't know why, here it seems as if you are hiding something from us or telling a lie
[30:42] what wrong have I done to you? Why are you blaming me?
[30:47] just because I am not your real sister? 
You have the right, you can do it
[30:51] but you are being unjust to me
[30:54] Falak, I have just asked a simple question from you
[30:57] that had you said something inappropriate about Aliya & Kabir? 
Yes or No!
[31:01] what's there to be so emotional about?
[31:04] I am not being emotional. I am feeling hurt by seeing this behavior of yours
[31:08] You have believed their words, but you don't believe whatever I am saying to you
[31:12] you don't trust me at all
[31:14] Enough Nawal! I completely trust Falak. Enough is enough
[31:19] don't cry my dear
[31:21] mom, I haven't done any such thing
[31:24] I know my dear, I know...
[31:27] mom, I haven't done any such thing
[31:35] sister, I was not in the favor to send Ilham with her
[31:39] you did so wrong
[31:41] you shouldn't have stopped me
[31:45] small kids stay with their mother
[31:49] she needs her mother's love & attention
[31:53] if we haven't sent her, then it would have been an oppression on her and...
[31:57] I don't want our names to be written in the list of oppressors
[32:02] have you forgotten how insensitive behavior Falak had shown while leaving Ilham?
[32:10] she is insensitive
[32:13] but we are not
[32:15] Kabir, Aliya is absolutely correct
[32:18] right now Ilham is quite a small child, let her stay with Falak
[32:24] don't snatch away her mother's love from her
[32:39] be quiet...
[32:47] what is this problem! I have already left her over there
[32:52] don't know why this problem is on my head
[32:54] she doesn't have to handle her, she is enjoying herself
[32:57] also they have left her on me, who will handle this problem now!
[33:01] be quiet
[33:03] they have put this problem on my head
[33:05] what's with you? Have some sense. The child has been crying since so long. Come here
[33:10] I am already having a severe headache. Handle her for sometime
[33:16] then feed her, she will go to sleep
[33:18] I just took the medicine, I want to sleep for a while
[33:21] Ask the maid to feed her, her feeder is over there
[33:25] the limit! 
come with me
[33:27] come on my dear...
[33:50] I send curse on you & on your bad and filthy thinking
[33:55] I don't want to keep any relation with such an abuser & low class thinking girl
[34:08] today you have broken our relation
[34:10] I, Kabir Salahuddin...  in my complete senses
[34:16] divorce you...
[34:37] I was sure that you will call
[34:40] don't you also think like my mother & sister Nawal that I am telling a lie?
[34:45] Falak, I know you cannot lie
[34:47] I trust you completely
[34:49] in fact, that's why I have called that you don't need to worry at all
[34:55] Thank God! at least someone believes me
[34:59] otherwise, everyone over here is doubting me
[35:01] nobody believes me
[35:04] now I think.. I wish that my parents would have been alive
[35:08] then they wouldn't have let anyone raise any finger or question on me
[35:12] they would have supported me
[35:15] even mom & sister Nawal doesn't believe me
[35:18] they think Kabir is the only one telling the truth
[35:22] you can't imagine the condition of my heart right now
[35:28] Falak, if I tell you that you shall raise your voice against this oppression then?
[35:33] here, my own family members aren't believing me. They believe on Kabir more than me
[35:39] and where my loved ones aren't listening to me, whom else do you expect to listen?
[35:42] why will anyone believe me?
[35:44] everyone will believe you, Falak
[35:46] try to gather courage once
[35:48] you have to tell the world about the oppression done on you
[35:54] I want to expose Kabir in front of the entire world
[35:58] he is such a renown businessman
[36:00] and his actions are way too worse than an animal
[36:08] what will happen by doing this?
[36:10] the evil will keep on spreading until we don't drag it to his end result
[36:21] Falak, do think upon my suggestion
[36:47] its not here
[37:55] oh Kabir, what are you doing? Leave it.
 I will do it myself, give it to me
[37:58] sit quietly, I am cleaning it
[38:00] Kabir, give it to me. It doesn't look good. 
Falak...
[38:08] I am doing it
[38:10] don't you trust me?
[38:29] brother, she is like my mother
[38:32] and I have told her, I have told this to her on the first night of our marriage
[38:37] not like mother, but like a lover...
Falak!
[38:41] Kabir, sister Aliya... I won't spare you guys!
[39:11] hello!
[39:13] I have thought about your suggestion
[39:19] I am ready
