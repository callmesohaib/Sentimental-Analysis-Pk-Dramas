[00:12] do you know Hamza I was going through a very tough time in my life when you came along.
[00:19] Its your encouragement that allowed me to get stable. 
[00:22] I respect you a lot, sister
[00:25] but if you disrespect me, then don't expect me to respect you.
[00:30]  I think sister Aaliya didn't tell you many things that I can do.
[00:34] You throw a party to celebrate your wedding when your family is happy.
[00:38] You married that girl secretively. 
[00:41] I was insulted every time. And here, you have aunty.
[00:44] She insults me every other time. It mean I have no value. 
[00:47] Alright, if she wants to cancel, do it. I'll be happy with whatever she wants.
[01:00] I thought you were different than Kabeer
[01:03] You will say whats right. 
[01:06] You'll have separate values for everybody at home.
[01:11] You will be able to give people their rights to express what they want but...
[01:16]  I was wrong.
[01:19] Mom has a problem holding a reception at home.
[01:24] I'll do one thing, let me book a nice venue. 
[01:28] then I think she'll not object.
[01:35] As you find right, as you wish
[01:43] See, I can't see you worried
[01:48] you are right
[01:50] we haven't committed any sin
[01:53] then why shall we care about others?
[01:59] I will do everything as per your choice
[02:22] Zakiya... come here for a second
[02:34] maam Nawal, somebody has sent these flowers
[02:39] who sent them?
[02:40] I don't know, but the courier guy had brought them
[02:42] Okay, keep them & please make me a cup of tea
[03:52] you must have got the invitation card
[03:56] Hamza & I are keeping a very big reception in the joy of our wedding
[04:01] you will come, right?
[04:04] you didn't had to do this
[04:07] what do you want to prove by sending me an invitation?
[04:11] why are you doing all this?
[04:13] You are my only sister. 
[04:15] And if a sister will not come in her sister's wedding reception then it will look so awkward
[04:18] what will people think?
[04:21] As it is, only you are my parents family. So its mandatory for you to come over
[04:28] Just think, people will gossip if nobody will come from my side
[04:32] No, no... you have to come for sure. You will come, right?
[04:56] I liked him.
[04:58] But no, he loved you. Right? He was blind in your love.
[05:03] So I had to do something to create misunderstandings between both of you.
[05:28] So finally you have kept the function of your wedding reception
[05:31] Since I had forbidden you for not doing it at home so you booked a hotel, very good!
[05:37] It had to be done, so I thought why not now
[05:40] this way Falak will also meet everyone
[05:44] if you have come to invite me on this function, then I am sorry. But I will not attend
[05:53] Do I need to invite you?
[05:57] You are my mother, my family...  so obviously you'll be there
[06:07] maybe you are not getting my point. Naazish & I will not attend this wedding reception
[06:15] Okay
[06:17] so it means that you have decided that you'll not take part in your son's happiness
[06:23] there is no need for an argument, dear
[06:26] if you can make such a big decision of your life yourself, 
[06:30] without asking me or sister. Without involving us, then... 
[06:34] do the wedding reception yourself as well. 
What is the need for us to come over there, dear?
[06:42] Fine! if this is the choice of you people
[06:46] then I won't insist
[06:52] anyways, by the way... kindly handover me our extended family's jewelry and the jewelry that you had kept for my to-be wife
[07:07] Why? Why shall I give it to you?
[07:12] Falak is my wife, she has a right on them. She has to wear them tomorrow on the wedding reception
[07:20] maybe she is associated to you, but she isn't related to me at all
[07:26] I haven't accepted her at all
[07:29] A girl who can betray her sister, and can take over her right
[07:35] I will never accept that girl as my daughter-in-law, my dear
[07:38] you need to be clear on this
[07:41] I mean, what if tomorrow she did the same with you that she has done with her sister
[07:47] then we'll face quite a huge loss
[07:50] mom please, why are you saying such things?
[07:53] Falak isn't that type of a girl
[07:57] She is not like this or that... but I know how she is. As Aliya has told me the entire story
[08:05] whatever sister Aliya has told you is a complete lie
[08:09] they did injustice with Falak, she was betrayed
[08:14] Trust me! Falak loves you a lot, she respects you a lot
[08:19] Besides, she had asked me to cancel this event
[08:22] and to do everything as per your mom's choice
[08:28] please try talking to her once for my sake
[08:33] all of your misunderstandings will be cleared
[08:38] try to remove the blindfold of misunderstanding from your eyes once
[08:41] my eyes aren't blind folded by misunderstanding, but yours
[08:47] you are unable to see anything
[08:49] and these sugar coated words, you can come into them but I cannot. I am not that fool, my dear
[08:55] a lot of people are saying the same thing about this girl
[08:58] everyone cannot lie, right?
There must be something
[09:02] its just that only you cannot see
[09:06] remember my words... 
[09:09] wherever you see smoke, just believe it that must be some fire 
[09:18] and the day you'll get to know her reality, you'll regret a lot
[09:24] I feel really sorry for you, my dear.
Really!
[09:30] anyways, I have a lot of work
[10:11] Hamza, I had told you not to talk to aunty. She will not give them
[10:16] what was the need to talk to her?
[10:19] that jewelry was for my to-be wife
[10:22] that's why you have the right on them
[10:25] Hamza, there is no value of things
[10:28] you have entered my life, so what more I would be needing?
[10:34] we are going to the mall right away, and I will buy you much better jewelry than that
[10:38] what's with you Hamza? I already have a few old sets, I will wear something from them
[10:43] No, there is no need to. Today onward you'll only wear whatever I will buy for you
[10:48] Okay fine just relax now. Its okay
[12:04] I know Nawal, you are hurt and angry with me
[12:08] but I promise you, I will fix everything. Just trust me for once
[12:13] Nawal, whatever pain you've been through because of me. I will repent it
[12:18] I will give you so much of love that you'll forget everything
[12:21] still, if you ever feel that we cannot unite ever
[12:25] then I will never come in your way, that's my promise
[13:25] your sister & aunty didn't come?
[13:27] you already know that they will not come
[13:29] I know, but the guests doesn't know
[13:33] everyone is asking the same thing that why they haven't come. What shall I answer everyone?
[13:39] we'll discuss it at home, don't spoil mine & your mood by talking on it
[14:38] these are all those gifts that you had gifted me
[14:42] now I have returned all of those things that you had given me
[14:47] Nawal, you shouldn't have come here
[14:49] it was important to come, because I didn't wanted any memory of this relation
[14:58] I am disappointed that I had fallen in love with such a disgusting & lowly person
[15:05] I feel disappointed that I.. 
this isn't any disappointment at all!
[15:09]  You'll regret when her reality will be exposed to you.
You'll see her true face
[15:16] then you'll understand that she had planned to create misunderstandings between us
[15:24] what rubbish you are talking?
[15:26] by telling all these lies, you want to make him go against me. Right?
[15:29] and Hamza, what are you listening? Call the guards & oust her
[15:34] I feel disgusted from you. I had considered you my sister, and look what you've proved to be
[15:40] oblivious person, selfish!
[15:43] Stop it Nawal! What's her fault in it? What she did?
[15:48] I had left you just because of you
[15:51] the person whom I hate the most until today, you had been in an affair with that guy!
[15:57] such a stupidity doesn't suits you while being such a big businessman, Hamza
[16:04] Open your eyes! I never had an affair with Kabir. It was all her planning
[16:19] to take me to Kabir's house, to call you from there & to call you over
[16:23] Its all her doing!
[16:25] Open your eyes and see what's happening with you!
[16:34] if I had to be in an affair, then I wouldn't have done it when you had gone after leaving me?
[16:41] She has trapped you for her benefit
[16:48] you are lying. Complete lie!
[16:56] what benefit Falak would have from me?
[16:58] Your money, your wealth.. your status. Is this what you had said to me, right?
[17:05] She is telling a lie. When did I said all this? And why would I say this, Hamza?
[17:12] No, its not me who is lying but you. And you know it very well
[17:17] Stop it! Enough is enough. What do you want to prove by coming here & saying all this?
[17:22] do you consider yourself a very pious person?
[17:24] I was quiet until now so that your honor wouldn't get ruined
[17:28] but if everyone wants to hear, then let me tell them
[17:30] You got me divorced by having an affair with Kabir, also you had provoked him against me
[17:35] and now you are provoking Hamza against me!
[17:37] don't know why she is telling so many lies. Why don't you spare my life?
[17:40] do a favor on me & spare my life. Go away from here
[17:45] I don't need anyone's testimony to prove myself a pious person
[17:54] Nawal. go away from here
[17:58] before that I... 
before that what you'll do?
[18:01] what will you do with your ex-fiance?
[18:05] will you push me out of this place yourself? Will you drag me? or beat me?
[18:08] but do you know, its not even your fault
[18:11] misunderstanding is such a disease
[18:12] a person looses its capability to think, he becomes blind. And you!
[18:16] You should die of shame, God is still giving your leniency Falak
[18:21] but I will say one thing to you for sure
[18:24] this world is karma
[18:27] whatever you did, you have to bear it
[18:31] and God never wastes anyone's tolerance
[20:12] and Hamza, you already know. Why would I lie?
[20:15] stop this rubbish!
[20:17] today you are looking quite fresh & happy. All praise to God
[20:21] thanks to God a million times that I have recovered after staying sick for so long
[20:34] I hate you!
[20:37] you haven't done good to me
[20:40] I will never forgive you!
[20:43] Hamza, control yourself
[20:47] what does she think of herself?
[20:48] If I want, I would have answered to all of her words there & then
[20:52] but still I stayed quiet. Why? 
Just for the sake of her respect
[20:56] but she! She has tarnished my image in front of all. I was so embarrassed!
[21:03] She came over there for that, so that she can spoil our function.
[21:06] And she got successful in it. 
Look at your condition!
[21:09] Who had invited her? You, right?
[21:12] if you had to invite her, then you should have asked me once
[21:15] I wanted to invite her that's why I had invited
[21:18] She doesn't consider herself as my sister, but I do consider her as my sister
[21:21] who else do I have in this world except for her?
[21:26] I had thought that she will come & will give blessings to her sister
[21:29] how would I know that she will do all these dramas?
[21:33] I had invited her by thinking that all the old grievances will be over, but what she did?
[21:37] She came over there & didn't bothered about her honor or ours
[21:41] anyways, whatever happened was so wrong
[21:45] all the big businessman of this city were there along with their families
[21:49] I was feeling so embarrassed in front of them
[21:52] even I got embarrassed! All of my friends & acquaintances were there. What they must be thinking about me!
[21:58] She made a spectacle in front of all!
[22:04] what is this drama? Why you both are making so much of noise? What is wrong?
[22:08] what difference does it make to you?
[22:09] what do you mean?
[22:11] every guest over there was asking me that where is my family in my wedding reception?
[22:15] do you know, how embarrassed I was because of you?
[22:17] and if we would have come to your function, then how embarrassed we would have been. Have you ever thought about it?
[22:22] What's with you, mom? I have married her, I haven't committed any sin
[22:28] people who gets married secretively, is equivalent to committing a sin my dear
[22:43] A marriage is done by doing an open announcement, with the family & friends
[22:48] and people who gets married secretively, somewhere there is some doubt in their heart
[22:52] come on mom, why are you doing such typical women talks!
[22:58] Hamza, what's with you? How are you talking to mom!
[23:01] We did very well by not coming over there. At least, there wasn't any problem because of us
[23:10] let it be Naazish, he is taking out his anger of some other matter on us
[23:13] what you guys were thinking? Won't I get the news?
[23:20] Mom, angry about what? What are you saying?
[23:24] they had invited Nawal on their function, and she came as well
[23:28] She threw all the gifts on Hamza's face whichever he had gifted her, she did great insult of him
[23:40] what were you both thinking, that she will bring a garland for you?
[23:43] Will she meet happily with both of you?
[23:45] have you gone mad?
[23:46] you have already ruined that girl's life, At least now spare my son!
[23:51] Even I don't like talking to her. Whatever she did to me, after that I don't want to see her face even
[23:57] She did nothing with you, nor she is in any relation with Kabir
[24:07] Are you trusting her?
[24:09] she couldn't love the people who took care of her, did her upbringing. She left her own child...
[24:16] what are you thinking? Can she become yours or ours?
[24:22] Aunty, why are you accusing me?
[24:25] its not an accusation, its reality
[24:28] He has become blind & crazy in your love, but I can see everything!
[24:32] what you can see? Can you see my pain?
[24:35] my daughter was separated from me, they had snatched away my daughter forcefully from me
[24:38] I am in so much of pain, can you see? 
No, you cannot understand
[24:42] and then you are accusing me
[24:46] and Hamza, you already know. Why would I lie?
[24:50] stop this rubbish!
[24:54] Aliya has told me the entire story
[24:56] nobody had snatched your daughter from you
[24:59] you had left your daughter in the hospital yourself
[25:03] Hamza, what is she saying?
[25:04] She is lying!
[25:06] I have explained you millions of times that injustice was done with Falak, but you aren't believing me
[25:17] Mom, you had said such a big thing to Falak
[25:20] you shouldn't have said this
[25:22] Yes! I did wrong, she did wrong...
[25:27] you haven't done anything wrong, nor she did anything wrong.
 Its just us who are wrong!
[25:36] lets go, let it be. Come on forget it.
mom...
[25:44] Falak...
don't say anything, Hamza
[25:47] I am so hurt today
[25:49] aunty has reminded me all of my wounds
[25:52] I was trying to gather myself with a lot of difficulty, and this happened
[25:57] its just me who is wrong for all, maybe I want bad for everyone
[26:02] I wish, I would have died...
[26:05] everyone's difficulties, issues & hatred will be over with me
[26:09] See, don't say this
[26:11] I know mom had said so much to you in anger, please don't take it to your heart
[26:15] in fact, not only mom but you don't need to listen to anyone
[26:19] Okay?
I am with you, right?
[26:58] I wish you had been here right now
[27:02] with me...
[27:08] I am feeling so alone without you
[27:29] so, what's up?
[27:31] we were playing tick tack toe, and this time I will start. Don't know what trick she does that she wins in every game
[27:36] really?
[27:37] by the way Aliya, did you talk to Kabir? Did you tell him that we are settling here permanently
[27:45] No, I haven't told him as of yet. I couldn't talk to him
[27:50] Okay fine, do talk to him about it whenever you get a chance
[27:54]  let me book your ticket in the next few days, so do your packing,
[27:58] And Aliya please, do make all her school related documents as soon as you reach there. So that there won't be any wastage of time
[28:05] and yes! Do make Elham's custody papers & passport too
[28:15] Tauqir, Kabir will not agree
[28:20] I had forced him a lot before coming here, but he was also right. He will be left all alone over there
[28:25] Aliya, how will he take care of Elham along with the business?
[28:29] for God sake, he had to do a lot of traveling for work. How will he manage?
[28:34] See, its better for Elham to stay with us. Tell Kabir to leave her responsibility on us
[28:41] what do you think? I wouldn't have said all this to him?
[28:47] Tauqeer, he doesn't agree
[28:50] Fine, then I will talk to him myself
[28:54] Elhaam will stay with us
[28:57] just get her passport
[29:01] Okay
[29:18] I am disappointed that I had fallen in love with such a disgusting & lowly person
[29:57] Excuse me sir
yes
[29:58] you have a week's trip to Europe, and you have meetings with three companies
[30:03] also you have to attend a mega conference too
[30:06] Okay, text me the schedule. I will look into it
[30:10] Right, sir
[30:13] Sir, are you alright?
[30:20] Sir, the meeting is ready & everyone is waiting for you
[30:24] Okay, you may go
[30:25] Okay sir
[30:28] Please attend the meeting, I am going home as I am not feeling well
[30:34] right sir
[31:02] Greetings Kabir!
[31:05] Greetings! Nawal you... please come
[31:08] actually I was missing her so I thought to meet Elhaam
[31:13] you did very well by coming here
[31:16] Look Elhaam baby, who is here. You aunt is here
[31:19] Look what your aunt got for you
[31:23] Look at this...
Look at this, does she like it?
[31:25] what was the need to do this formality?
 She already have so many toys, right?
[31:30] I have brought it all out of my happiness
[31:32] Look at this...
Its alright. Look, so you find it right?
[31:36] its a littler bigger, but its ok
[31:41] actually this was of her exact size, its such a nice color
[31:44] that's beautiful... very nice
[31:48] by the Nawal, what was the need for all this? All of this formality?
[31:52] See, its the matter of an aunt & her niece so don't interfere in it
[31:57] come to me, why are you crying?
[32:03] what happen to you....
[32:07] I think she is hungry...
Noor!
[32:26] she cries like this whenever she is hungry
[32:29] Look, she is still crying. She doesn't wait for a single minute
[32:32] Believe me, I feel hurt whenever she cries
[32:36] by the way, today you are looking quite fresh & happy. All praise to God
[32:41] thanks to God a million times that I have recovered after staying sick for so long
[32:49] by the way Kabir, I want to say thanks to you!
[32:53] the way you took care of me when I was sick
[32:57] I am grateful to you
[33:00] Being a human, it was my duty to do all this
[33:04] Please don't think too much about it
[33:20] a lot had happened with you, and you didn't even tell me
[33:24] at least, you could have called me once
[33:27] what you would have done if I had called you?
[33:29] I would have come & fixed Falak's mind!
[33:33] I am so angry right now
[33:37] even a witch leaves seven houses next to hers
[33:39] didn't she feel ashamed? She had married your fiance
[33:46] whatever happened, has happened for good
[33:49] at least, I have recognized that who is my loved one & who is not
[33:58] Hamza, was such a wise guy, how come he came into Falak's words?
[34:03] hasn't he seen you? Doesn't he know you? How can he put such a big blame on you!
[34:11] Falak did so wrong with you
[34:13] I always used to say that she is such an oblivious
[34:16] don't do so many favors of her! But neither you nor Sultana used to listen to me
[34:23] what's done is done! 
We did everything by considering it as a good deed
[34:28] we didn't had an idea that in return we'll get an evildoing
[34:35] aunty, do you know...
[34:39] sometimes I think that mom has died
[34:44] but maybe there was some betterment in it, because if she would have seen this form of Falak then
[34:49] aunty, she would have been hurt very badly.
[34:51] and she must have cursed herself that maybe there was some lacking in her upbringing
[34:57] I had explained Sultana a lot
[35:01] that if she wants to keep her, then keep her under certain limits
[35:05] but she had never listened to me
[35:09] Sultana did so many stupidities
[35:11] Also while dying, she had made her the owner of half of her wealth too
[35:16] don't repeat the old matters now
[35:20] we cannot change what's already done
[35:24] you'll see Nawal
[35:27] God will create better opportunities for you
[35:32] people who have good intentions
[35:35] God blesses them for sure
[35:39] Greedy people are always empty hands
[35:42] and whatever wrong Falak did to you, for sure she will be punished for it
[35:48] anyways leave this topic, tell me how is uncle & why he didn't come along?
[35:58] he will come within a few days. 
he had to stay there due to some business related matters
[36:03] and I thought to go & meet my daughter
[36:07] you did very well by coming here
[36:09] Rest for sometime as you came after such a long journey. Then I will serve the lunch
[36:16] I pray that God always keep you happy, and whatever problems you have faced in your life shall be over soon
[36:54] excuse me, sir
[36:56] yes
[36:57] I want to discuss something with you
[37:00] say it, what's the matter?
[37:02] actually tomorrow onward I won't come on the job
[37:08] what!
[37:09] make some other arrangements for maam Elhaam
[37:11] but why? What had happened? Is there any problem in the salary?
[37:14] No no, there isn't any issue or problem in the salary
[37:17] actually my husband got a job in Hyderabad, and we have to shift there within this week
[37:23] if there was any such thing, then you should have informed me earlier
[37:27] from where I will arrange a new nanny suddenly?
[37:30] even I got to know it today, if I would have known then I would have informed you earlier
[37:34] don't you worry at all! Somehow you'll get someone
[37:38] its the matter to be worried
[37:40] Elhaam was quite attached to you, and I was satisfied as well
[37:44] even I have become so attached to her, and I will miss her a lot
[37:49] you have given me a tension for no reason
[37:52] isn't it possible that you shall keep coming until you shift?
[37:58] until then I will arrange a new nanny
[38:00] No sir, it will be difficult as I have to do the packing as well and I am all alone
[38:04] I won't be able to come. Don't you worry at all.
 I have mentioned everything in the notes
[38:10] whomsoever you'll appoint for Elham, you can give those notes to her. And she will handle everything easily
[38:15] and if there would be any problem then call me, I will explain everything
[38:24] Okay
[38:26] thank you, sir...
