[03:19] You look good.
You too.
[03:27] Nawal I know you're not happy with this marriage.
[03:36] You didn't want to marry me.
[03:39] But the circumstances made you do it.
[03:45] But I want you trust me.
[03:49] I'll never burden you more than needed.
[03:56] You're right.
[03:59] I didn't want to marry you.
[04:03] But not because of you or Ilham.
[04:10] I felt how would I face people
[04:15] but after everybody made me understand, I thought why should I let others govern my life.
[04:27] Why should I give them so much importance? Its my life and I'll live it like I want too.
[04:39] Some times God decides for us
[04:43] and we don't think they're right. We're unhappy with those decisions.
[04:53] But then time makes us realize that God plans for the best.
[05:08] I did not marry you because someone told me to or pressurized me.
[05:18] I married you with all my senses
[05:21] and I'll take care of all my responsibilities, happy. Whether you tell me or not.
[05:33] I'm glad that you're in my life.
[06:35] Hello?
[06:36] Falak. I've been calling you since long. Why didn't you answer?
[06:41] Listen to me. I was getting ready. Hamza and I are going for lunch and then shopping.
[06:47] You tell me how are you, hows everything?
[06:50] Did you get the news?
[06:52] What news?
[06:54] You really don't know what happened?
[06:57] Will you tell me or just create suspense?
[07:00] Nawal and Kabeer got married.
[07:14] What? Are you mad? What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[07:19] I'm in my senses and I'm telling the truth.
[07:24] Nawal and Kabeer are married?
[07:28] How is it possible?
[07:32] How can they get married?
See..
[07:36] I told you what I knew. You see what you want to do.
[07:43] I was scared this would happen.
[07:45] Falak, lets go?
[07:50] What happened? Why do you look worried?
[07:54] Hamza..
[07:58] What happened?
[08:00] Nawal and Kabeer got married.
[08:03] What?
[08:04] Didn't I tell you they liked each other?
[08:08] Nobody believed us. God knows since when they had their affair and kept fooling us.
[08:14] Why are you so angry? What happened Hamza?
[08:18] What would Hamza say? I'll tell you. You taunted me so much.
[08:23] You didn't believe me. My own sister destroyed my house. Nawal, did.
[08:35] Now I understand that she turned Kabeer against me.
[08:39] God knows what she would tell him. She destroyed my life.
[08:45] What does all this mean now?
[08:51] Nawal and Kabeer are married now.
[09:11] What? Are you shocked now?
[09:13] You people didn't believe me when I told you.
[09:16] Instead you called me characterless and accused me.
[09:25] Did you see now? You were like if Nawal had cast a spell on you. You wouldn't hear a thing.
[09:38] So? Why are you so upset now?
[09:43] What difference does it make to you no matter who Nawal marries?
[09:46] Why would it not make a difference to me?
[09:49] She accused my character. I was deemed the liar. I can talk and I will talk. Nobody can stop me.
[10:06] See Falak, they can do whatever they want.
[10:11] It doesn't make a difference to me and it shouldn't to you as well.
[10:17] Exactly. That's my point. I'm saying the same thing.
[10:22] No matter what Nawal and Kabeer do in their life, it shouldn't be your concern.
[10:28] But Hamza when I told everyone, nobody trusted me.
[10:34] Aunty you used to say.. you swore on Nawal's innocence.
[10:39] What happened now? Why did they get married?
[10:48] Falak listen to me.
[10:51] After today we will not discuss this topic..
[10:56] But Hamza..
[10:57] Stop it Falak. I told you. Enough!
[11:38] Strange. God knows what mess their family is.
[11:43] God knows.
[12:04] What did you think, I'd never find out?
[12:09] I didn't get married secretively that you wouldn't know.
[12:16] You must be very happy. You got what you wanted.
[12:21] Happiness is temporary but I'm at peace
[12:25] because I didn't deny anybody's rights or turned someone against anyone.
[12:30] I didn't lie to anyone and I didn't marry because I was greedy.
[12:38] Really? If you aren't greedy why did you marry Kabeer?
[12:45] You screamed and told everyone there was nothing between you and Kabeer. So how did you get married now?
[12:51] Think of it as fate brought us together.
[12:58] As it is this shouldn't bother you because you cannot hear the truth
[13:03] and I do not tell lies so let it be.
[13:07] I left Kabeer. Think of it like this.
[13:11] You never thought he deserved you.
[13:14] So what did you do? Someone I thought was not worth me, you married him?
[13:18] So you should be happy. I married someone you left.
[13:28] Nawal, I know Kabeer more than you.
[13:33] I know you'll never be happy with him. He will never keep you happy.
[13:38] Remember what I told you.
[13:40] So after claiming what belongs to others you have now started telling horoscopes as well. Wow.
[13:51] You have left Kabeer so whether I'm happy or not, its my fate.
[13:58] It shouldn't bother you Falak.
[14:51] Nazish what new story is now opening in our lives.
[14:57] I am thinking whether I made a mistake in understanding Nawal
[15:02] Mom are you trusting what Falak said?
[15:07] She's right. If they did not have an affair, why would they get married?
[15:12] Its not like this mom. I think Nawal's decision is right.
[15:17] She can marry whoever she wants.
[15:21] And if she married Kabeer, where is it written that she had an affair with Kabeer.
[15:27] No mom.
[15:33] I think there is something that has happened, that's why they took this decision.
[15:42] By the way mom, you should ask Aaliya. She'll tell you the truth.
[15:51] Yes. I'll ask Aaliya. Good idea.
[16:23] Nawal I like this one.
Really?
[16:26] If you like it, we'll get it.
[16:28] I'll get what you like before we get married then after that I'll get what I like.
[16:32] If you're wearing them for me, I should be choosing them.
[16:35] Tell me.
So what about what I like?
[16:39] I'm the one you like.
[16:47] She spent all day with Kabeer. First they were scared of Aaliya but not anymore.
[16:53] They'll spend the days and nights together now.
[17:02] Didn't I tell you? They liked each other but nobody believed me.
[17:07] God knows since when they had their affair.
[17:37] Hamza? Where were you? I've been calling you since long. Why didn't you answer?
[17:43] Why? What happened? I'm here.
[17:45] What happened? Do you know how worried I was? Where were you?
[17:51] Don't disturb me with such useless questions.
[18:13] I made your breakfast myself.
[18:15] Why? Were are the servants?
[18:18] I just wanted to so I made it.
[18:21] But you don't have to do this. We have servants for all this.
[18:25] Hamza you're my husband. I like doing your work.
Okay.
[18:37] Hamza, have your breakfast and then we'll spend the entire day together.
[18:42] We'll go to a good place and hang out.
[18:46] I'm sorry Falak but I have back to back meetings today. I'll not get time.
[18:53] Hamza, I'm very upset and I know you're upset as well.
[18:59] That's why I thought we should go away somewhere. Away from all these tensions.
[19:07] Lets go out of town. Far away.
[19:11] No. I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.
[19:19] If you want to go, you can go with the driver. Or call your friend and go for an outing.
[19:26] Don't wait up for me.
[19:54] I'll get tea made.
Please..
[19:56] Oh, where is Ilham?
She just slept.
[19:59] Really?
[20:00] She was playing with Nawal. She slept in her lap while playing.
[20:05] Alright. Sit. I want to talk.
[20:11] Aaliya, is everything alright?
[20:13] Yes everything is alright. Its just Aaliya and I are going back tomorrow.
[20:18] So soon?
[20:19] Why are you going back so soon? You just got here. Stay for a few days.
[20:25] Kabeer the work load is immense.
[20:28] My partner called and said he couldn't handle the work. The company is new. I'll have to go.
[20:39] Whatever Aaliya and I came for, its done. You and Nawal are married now.
[20:43] All praise to God.
[20:47] Now Aaliya and I have no worries about Ilham, that's why we're leaving.
[20:54] But Aaliya, you should have stayed for a few days.
[20:57] You should come to meet us in Germany. We'll hang out and enjoy together.
[21:07] As God wills. Well, have a safe flight. I think we should plan a good dinner tonight.
[22:05] Hello?
[22:06] Sara and I have a plan for dinner. If you want I'll come pick you.
[22:13] I don't want to go. You two should go.
Why? What happened?
[22:19] I don't know, I'm very angry. I don't want to do anything.
[22:24] I want to burn everything down.
[22:27] So you're worried about Kabeer and Nawal.
[22:34] Of course. I don't understand how its possible.
[22:39] They didn't even like each other and they didn't even have an affair.
[22:43] How can they get married now?
[22:46] Do you remember?
[22:47] You misbehaved with them in the hotel.
[22:50] So what else would I have done? She created a scene at my reception.
[22:55] She threw the gift pack on Hamza. We were so embarrassed.
[23:00] After what happened with her, she deserved it.
[23:03] Maybe after she was so embarrassed, they decided to get married to shut people up.
[23:10] I created differences between Hamza and Nawal after so much trouble.
[23:14] I showed him that Nawal and Kabeer had something going on.
[23:21] But it was only to turn him against her. I didn't know they'd get married in real.
[23:25] How is it possible? I'm so angry.
[23:29] I will not let them be in peace. I'll make their lives hell. How could they get married?
[23:35] Should I give you a suggestion Falak? You wanted Hamza and now you have him.
[23:41] Now you shouldn't bother about Nawal and Kabeer.
[23:43] Let them be. You'll be at peace this way.
Not at all.
[24:27] What happened? Why are you looking at me like this?
[24:30] So you played this game.
[24:35] Mom and I were right about you. You turned Hamza against Nawal.
[24:43] What do you mean? What are you saying? What game?
[24:47] Don't be so innocent. I heard everything.
[24:54] Falak, aren't you ashamed? You destroyed your sister's house to get what you wanted.
[25:02] They did you such big favors and you returned their favors like this?
[25:07] What are you saying? I don't understand.
[25:11] You will now understand. Let Hamza come today.
[25:29] You will do no such thing. Remember this.
[25:33] I'm warning you if you talk to me in this tone, again.
[25:39] You ungrateful woman!
[25:48] Mom is right about you. You can never be someone's.
[25:54] Yes. I can never be. I will never. Now? What can you do?
[26:00] Let Hamza come today. I'll tell him everything.
[26:09] His eyes should be opened about the girl he now claims to love. He should know,
[26:16] what his wife is up to!
[26:19] You can do nothing.
[26:25] You and I both are here. We'll see.
[26:47] Mom look at how she dared to threaten me.
[26:51] If I tell everything to Hamza, it'll be bad.
[26:55] I told you mom, Nawal and Kabeer had nothing going on. It is all Falak's doing.
[27:03] She trapped Hamza and see now, she trapped Hamza so successfully.
[27:11] And he's so stupid, he believed her.
[27:25] What happened? Is everything alright? You look worried.
[27:29] Didn't I tell you Falak trapped you with a proper plan? Didn't I?
[27:35] You told me this earlier as well.
[27:37] Yes but today we heard Falak say all this herself.
[27:46] Did Falak tell you everything herself?
[27:48] She didn't tell us. She was talking to her friend on the phone and we heard.
[27:54] Nazish.. this is all a lie. I didn't say anything.. Hamza, I didn't..
Falak..
[28:02] You know aunty and Nazish don't like me since day one.
[28:08] They just want me out of this house. Nazish threatened me in the morning
[28:13] that she would get you to insult me and throw me out. And now she's lying.
[28:19] She's lying. Falak aren't you ashamed of lying?
[28:23] I heard everything myself.
I'm not lying. You are.
[28:30] Why don't you to ask me to leave directly?
[28:34] Hamza I don't want to live here, please listen to them.
[28:37] I can live without you but I cannot live with this insult everyday.
[28:42] I feel suffocated. I get insulted all the time.
[28:54] You're not going anywhere, Falak.
[29:01] Promise me, that you'll give Falak the respect she deserves.
[29:08] And if that doesn't happen, then..
Then?
[29:11] Then what?
[29:16] I'll take Falak and leave.
[29:56] Mom.. Are you alright?
[30:11] Mom..
[30:28] Everything will be alright Falak. Don't worry.
[30:35] How can I not worry? Hamza nothing will be alright.
[30:38] As long as Nazish is in this house, nothing will be okay.
[30:43] She keeps instigating aunty against me all day.
[30:45] I know once she leaves aunty and I will be okay.
[30:50] Ask Nazish to go back to her house.
[30:54] Falak this isn't possible. She has the same right on this house like I.
[31:00] Alright. She can stay here. Get me another house and we'll shift there.
[31:06] That's not possible either.
[31:10] I cannot leave my mom and sister. They're my responsibility.
[31:14] I will never leave my responsibility. I'll never do this.
[31:20] I don't have so much guts.
[31:22] And you don't have my responsibility? The pain I'm going through. 
[31:26] My life has become a big mess. Its so difficult, you don't even realize.
[31:33] Aunty doesn't want to accept you. I'm telling you, she'll never accept me. 
[31:39] How long have we been married for? Months now. 
[31:45] Nothing will be alright, Hamza.
I'm telling you Falak..
[31:50] Everything will be fine. Just give it some time.
[32:07] Why isn't Hamza listening to me? I think I'll have to do something.
[34:04] Yes so newly weds? Whats your plan for your honeymoon?
[34:07] We have no plans for honeymoon, yet.
[34:10] I'm saying come to Germany with us.
[34:13]  The place is nice, the weather is superb. I'm sure you'll like it.
[34:18] Oh, ask Nawal where she wants to go. Germany or somewhere else?
[34:24] Nawal tell me. Where do you want to go?
[34:28] Actually Aaliya we have not thought about it and I don't think,
[34:33] we can go somewhere right now. Our business isn't so stable right now. 
[34:39] Let the business get stable and then we'll think about it.
[34:42] Actually Nawal is right. Let the business get stable and then we'll definitely go, if God wills.
[34:50] If God wills, everything will be alright soon. 
Amen
[34:54] Nawal you'll have to take care of Kabeer and Ilham.
Of course.
[35:02] Kabeer, you will take care of Nawal. If I get even a little complain, I'll scold you.
Aaliya..
[35:13] Now its time for our flight. Go and get Hafsa. Where is she?
[35:16] Where will she be? She'll be with Ilham. I'll call her.
[35:41] You must be very expert in this.
[35:47] After your husband passed away, you want to keep yourself busy.
[35:52]  That's why you do this
[35:54] You mind your own business.
[35:57] What I do and what I don't, don't worry about it?
[36:03] If I tell you the same thing to mind your own business, then?
[36:10] If you want to live in this house, live peacefully. 
[36:13] Otherwise you saw what happened last night? Do you want me to get you thrown out?
[36:26] How dare you talk to me, like that?
[36:33] What do you think of yourself?
[36:36] What I am and what I'm worth, let it be. What are you worth in this house?
[36:48] You're a widow, without any support.
[36:51]  You're sitting in your brother's house.
[36:54] My worth.. Ask your husband what I'm worth.
[37:03] If I take my share out of this house and this business, he'll be on the road.
[37:16] What do you want to say? What do you mean?
[37:21] If you talk to me in this way again. It'll be for the worst.
[38:07] Hamza, how much share does Nazish have in this business and the house?
[38:12] What? What sort of a question is this?
[38:16] Answer me what I'm asking you. How much share does she have?
[38:21] But why are you asking this? What interest do you have?
[38:25] Do you know what she said to me? 
[38:28] She said if I withdrew her share from the business and this house, you'd be on the road.
[38:34] Did she say this?
[38:35] Of course. She keeps taunting me. She's always showing me down.
[38:41] She asked me what I was worth? Now you get up and tell her what I'm worth. I'm your wife.
[38:47] Tell me one thing. Why did you have to talk to her on this topic?
[38:52] What do you mean?
[38:54] I made you understand. She's my elder sister and she's my responsibility.
[39:00] Don't argue with her.
[39:02] I don't argue. She comes and taunts me. She's always saying useless things.
[39:08] Okay fine. I'll talk to her and tell her to not argue with you.
[39:18] But please you also take care. Okay?
