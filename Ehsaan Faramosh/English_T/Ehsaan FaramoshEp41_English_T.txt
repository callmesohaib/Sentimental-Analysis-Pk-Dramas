[00:13] I will go to mama's house with her. I get stress at sister Aliya's house.
[00:19] No problem Kabir, she should have someone around her to take care of her no matter where she lives.
[00:26] You don't have to worry at all. It's just a matter of one night. We will get you out of her tomorrow morning.
[00:31] We will move your bail, God willing you will be out tomorrow morning.
[00:35] Have courage. We are with you OK?
[00:40] I don't care about her. Why will I call her?
[00:44] She has created all this mess.
[00:46] Rather she should call me and ask for an apology.
[00:49] This is our ancestors' house, we have grown up here and we have memories associated with this house.
[00:53] Toqeer, we will have to do something to get out of this crisis.
[01:07] I know that this decision is difficult
[01:11] but there is no way out other than this. I applied for loan but the request got declined.
[01:20] There is no new investor who wants to work with us.
[01:24] Toqeer, Kabir has work really hard to establish this business
[01:31] and if we wont help him today
[01:35] Then we will have this guilt for the rest of our lives that If we would have helped him then everything would be right.
[01:43] Kabir has lost his hopes but we wont let him lose his hopes.
[01:50] If we wont support him then who else will support him? Tell me.
[01:55] If this company will get closed then all dreams of Kabir will be broken.
[01:59] Then what will do by keeping the ownership of this house?
[02:06] You used to talk about giving importance to relations more than walls of rocks and sands.
[02:13] Have you forgotten that?
[02:15] Tell me one thing Aliya.
[02:17] Let's say, let's say and God forbid, if we wont be able to repay the loan.
[02:25] Then where will we go and what will we do?
[02:29] We will get a small rented house which we can afford in your salary.
[02:35] We only have to live there so we can live anywhere.
[02:41] By the way, memories always remain in our hearts and they will be with us wherever we will go.
[02:49] Toqeer,
[02:52] relations are made up of feelings of care for others.
[02:57] If we don't care about each other then there is no importance of relations.
[03:03] Please Toqeer.
[03:16] This is a very huge business so it will take time to wind up things.
[03:19] I promise you that when this time will pass then I will give you so much love that you will forget all of this.
[03:30] I wont let tears come in your eyes ever after our marriage.
[03:43] I was missing you.
[03:45] Me too.
[03:47] Come back. It's not good to test those who love you.
[03:52] How do I come back Nawal? I have such a big established business here,
[03:56] I wont return by winding up this business like this. Why don't you agree with me?
[04:00] Both of us will live happily here.
[04:02] Happiness is not connected with money Hamza.
[04:05] You promised me that you will come back but now you are not fulfilling that promise.
[04:11] Do you consider me such a feeling less person?
[04:15] Nawal, I know your feelings.
[04:18] Hamza if you don't want to come back then tell me I can't live in this pain.
[04:22] I wont force you at least tell me.
[04:28] Hello.
[04:49] Hamza why are you worrying that poor girl?
[04:52] Me and Nazish can't go back but you can go back.
[05:05] What's the matter sister? Is everything alright? You have called me in so much emergency.
[05:11] Kabir, you know about the whole situation of company.
[05:16] We are unable to pay salaries of workers and we don't have funds for other expenditures.
[05:22] So we will have to do something to get out of this situation.
[05:28] Our loan has also got rejected. Right?
[05:31] Otherwise, the situation of company would have been better to some extent.
[05:35] We need at least ten billion to get out of this situation.
[05:46] Ten billion.
[05:52] At the moment ten billion is a very huge amount for us sister and
[05:57] it is very difficult to arrange such a huge amount so quickly.
[06:01] From where we will arrange and how will we arrange that amount?
[06:04] I know, it's not that easy.
[06:06] That's why, me and Toqeer have decided to mortgage this house.
[06:13] What? What are you talking about? It's just a matter of ten years.
[06:20] The amount wont be that much that we will get out of all problems
[06:25] but we get sufficient time to think something else.
[06:30] Sister you can't do that. And why aren't you saying anything brother?
[06:35] This is our ancestors' house, we have passed our whole life here. How can we give this house to someone else?
[06:40] Kabir, Toqeer has no objection.
[06:45] What else can we do, it's our compulsion.
[06:47] At least your company will be saved by doing this.
[06:51] Brother this house is very important than company and very dear to me and you.
[06:57] We made this house with so much passion.
[07:00] I am not in favor of mortgaging this house at all. There will be some other way out.
[07:05] And sister, it's against my self respect that you will leave this house because of me.
[07:15] There is no other option.
[07:17] Something will be arranged sister but I wont let you mortgage this house.
[07:21] You have already done so much favors on me.
[07:24] I wont bear burden of anymore favors.
[07:26] I am not doing any favors Kabir.
[07:30] I have fifty percent shares in this company and I am doing this to save this company.
[07:35] Even then sister, I wont let you mortgage this house and this is my final decision.
[07:39] Please sister don't make me bow down in my eyes.
[07:56] Mom.
[07:57] Yes.
[07:57] Are you going somewhere?
Not me, both of us are going.
[08:02] Both of us?
[08:03] I am going to my friend's house and you are going on a dinner.
[08:07] Dinner?
[08:09] I have reserved a table for you.
[08:12] It's a surprise dinner for you.
[08:14] Which surprise?
[08:15] How will surprise be maintained if I tell you. Go and get ready quickly.
[08:20] OK, give me any hint otherwise there will be curiosity.
[08:24] It's just a matter of few minutes. Shh.
[08:35] Truly speaking, sister Aliya has made a wise decision but you get emotional for no reason.
[08:43] Stop it Falak. This is not a wise decision.
[08:49] Do you have any idea that how much I am attached to that house.
[08:52] She is not selling the house, she is just mortgaging that house.
[08:56] That is a big house and we will get good amount
[08:59] and we will regain our house when the situation of company will get better.
[09:02] Falak, no matter how much difficulties we face and company gets closed but I wont mortgage that house.
[09:11] That house is part of my soul.
[09:18] Let's mortgage this flat.
[09:24] What do you think? How about that?
[09:28] What are you talking about?
[09:31] We were discussing about that house so how comes this flat in between?
[09:34] You have recently shifted to this apartment but you have so much attachment with this.
[09:40] But you want me to mortgage that house in which my parents spent their lives and I have spent my childhood.
[09:48] I will never let that happen Falak.
[09:51] Who mortgages his memories?
[09:56] That person will be most senseless person of this world who will think that way.
[10:17] Hello.
[10:20] It's you Hamza?
Yes me.
[10:22] So this was mom's and yours plan?
[10:26] I thought to give you surprise.
So how was my surprise?
[10:32] I don't like this at all. Why have you come back?
[10:35] You should stay there and looked after your business and would enjoy your life as well.
[10:39] I can't even imagine to live without you.
[10:43] My life goes on if you are with me. I will be nothing if you are not with me.
[10:48] You were saying that you are missing me so I came back.
[10:54] And by the way, you have asked me come back with so much love
[10:58] and I am not that senseless that I wouldn't come back.
[11:05] By the way, you are looking so cute.
[11:10] No, I am angry with you.
[11:13] But you seems more cute when you are angry.
[11:21] What is this? I am talking to you and you are looking there.
[11:25] You should have told me earlier so I wouldn't come.
[11:29] Rather let me do one thing. I will book tomorrow's ticket and go back.
[11:34] I am warning you. There is no need for that. Don't even think about that.
[11:37] If you will go back then I will never talk to you again.
[11:42] I wont go anywhere. Rather if I will go anywhere then I will take you with me.
[11:47] Hey, I am just joking. I am very bad. Hmm?
[11:54] I bother you so much
[11:59] but I promise you.
[12:01] I will keep you this much happy after marriage.
[12:08] I know that.
[12:10] You know that? Then why did you say that I will leave you for the sake of my dreams.
[12:17] Remember one thing Nawal,
[12:21] I will never leave you.
[12:25] I am among those who always go along with you.
[12:28] I am not among those who leave you.
[12:58] Kabir, my car is bothering me so much.
[13:02] It has gone out of order three times within this week.
[13:05] I am thinking about changing my car.
[13:12] Falak, you know everything about company's situation.
[13:16] We can't buy new car right now.
[13:18] Ever since we have got married, we have this car and we didn't change this.
[13:22] There must be that much amount in the company's account that we can buy a new car.
[13:25] Falak if there would be that much amount in company's account then I would have paid salaries to workers.
[13:30] And by the way, don't use car so much.
[13:34] Control house budget as well. The AC is used round the clock and the door of room remains open.
[13:41] Only use AC at the time of sleep.
[13:44] And do I keep facing heat whole day? It's the limit Kabir.
[13:50] Listen Falak, matters are going out of my control, I have told you earlier.
[13:57] And it is possible that we will have to live without these luxuries.
[14:04] That's why get used to this.
[14:21] I am unable to understand what is happening with me?
[14:24] Kabir said to me that Falak get used to live without luxuries.
[14:31] I will live like that but I get scared when I think about my daughter.
[14:36] How will she grow up in this environment? We wont have anything for her.
[14:40] Will she live a suffocated life like me?
[14:45] Listen, don't worry, everything will be alright Falak.
[14:52] I am not worried about me, I am only worried about my daughter.
[14:58] We have no savings for her.
[15:01] We have nothing else except this business and if that gets closed then what will we do?
[15:07] Falak, every business has ups and downs
[15:11] and Kabir is working really hard and I am sure he will correct everything.
[15:19] Sister Nawal, you can help us.
[15:24] You have a plot of 1000 yards,
[15:28] if you will give us money after selling that plot then I promise me and Kabir will return your whole amount as soon as company's situation will become better. I promise.
[15:39] I know this is not easy.
[15:43] It's your life time earning.
[15:48] Just see,
[15:50] mom arranged my marriage so quickly.
[15:53] She should have waited for me to become independent.
[15:59] Then I am not begging in front of someone like this.
[16:05] I am saying this to you because of my compulsion.
[16:11] Just leave it if it is difficult for you.
[16:22] I know that I am not your real sister
[16:27] otherwise you wouldn't think once and would agree with me immediately.
[16:34] I am not your real sister that's why it is very difficult to make this decision.
[16:39] I have told you so many times that don't hurt my heart by saying things like this.
[16:46] I have always considered you as my real sister.
[16:53] Kabir said that he needs ten billion to stabilize the company.
[16:58] I don't know from where this amount will be arranged? What will happen to my daughter?
[17:03] How will everything be managed?
[17:13] I think Ilham has got up. Let me see her.
[17:33] I am unable to understand what is happening with me?
[17:36] Kabir said to me that Falak get used to live without luxuries.
[17:41] I will live like that but I get scared when I think about my daughter.
[17:45] How will she grow up in this environment? We wont have anything for her.
[17:53] If I would be your real sister then you would agree with me immediately
[17:56] but I am your step sister that's why it is difficult for you.
[18:01] Why will you give such a big sacrifice for me?
[18:42] Sir give her to me, she will sleep after drinking milk.
[18:45] Go. Come to me. Drink milk.
[18:54] Kabir, you came early from office today? Where were you?
[19:01] I went out to do some work. What happened?
[19:03] Do you have any idea, how much Ilham was crying?
[19:07] She was hungry and she was searching you.
[19:10] So maid is here, you should have asked her to give milk to Ilham.
[19:13] Falak, it's your responsibility to take care Ilham it's not maid's responsibility. You are her mother.
[19:18] You shouldn't have gone out.
[19:20] I go out sometimes but you have issues with that.
[19:24] Do you want me to stay at home like a disable person?
[19:26] I was against of living separately because of your acts.
[19:29] You are saying as if I have forcefully brought you in this house. Yes.
[19:33] yes! You have forcefully brought me here.
[19:37] If it would be in my authority then I wouldn't leave that house ever.
[19:56] Kabir, it's not your business asset. It's my house.
[20:00] And have you thought where will we go, where will we live and what will we do after that?
[20:51] What are you thinking?
[20:56] I am worried because of Falak's behavior.
[21:00] What has she done now?
[21:02] Sister, she doesn't take care Ilham at all.
[21:06] Just a like a mother is concerned about her child, she doesn't have at all.
[21:11] It's her first child so she might not get used to it.
[21:15] Give her some time, she will get used to that.
[21:19] How more time will she take?
[21:22] You also take care of Hafsa despite being a business woman you manage household matters as well.
[21:27] Perhaps, every girl has different nature
[21:32] and you must have been felt that Falak has a different nature.
[21:37] Not a bit, she is very different.
[21:40] She doesn't care about house, she doesn't care about me.
[21:45] She only wants to go for outings and parties.
[21:50] And you know sister that I don't like all of this at all
[21:55] and in fact I can't afford all this at the moment.
[21:58] I don't want you to leave this house.
[22:03] If you would stay here then Ilham would have been taken cared properly.
[22:09] Make her understand with love and affection, she will understand.
[22:17] I wish.
[22:34] What's up Falak?
[22:35] Greetings sister Nawal, how are you? Greetings, I am fine. How are you and how is Ilham?
[22:43] I am absolutely fine and Ilham is also fine.
[22:46] Falak I have contacted real estate broker. The plot will be sold after few days.
[22:53] Thank you so much sister Nawal.
[22:56] If I would have a real sister in place of you then she wouldn't have done that much for me what you are doing for me.
[23:02] It's your favor otherwise no one does that much for anyone.
[23:08] You are again saying such things.
[23:09] OK, I was just saying. Don't get angry.
[23:12] I pray that may God give you all happiness in life.
[23:31] Where is the file?
[23:43] Falak, oh I remember, I asked you to keep that file of this apartment.
[23:48] Why do you need that file?
[23:51] Because I am selling this apartment.
[23:54] What? Why are you selling this apartment?
[23:56] Falak, I need money, that's why I am selling.
[23:59] And by the assets are made so that we can sell them in your difficult time.
[24:03] Kabir, it's not your business asset. It's my house.
[24:07] How can you sell this?
[24:09] And have you thought where will we go, where will we live and what will we do after that?
[24:12] We will go back to same house from where we came here.
[24:15] How did you even think that I will go back to that house?
[24:19] What's the problem in going back to that house?
[24:22] Falak, it's our compulsion to go back to that house.
[24:24] And if you will ask me to rent out some other apartment then please don't say that because I can't afford that
[24:30] and please don't create any mess for me now.
[24:34] Am I creating mess? And what do you do?
[24:38] You just pass order that I want to do this, I am doing this.
[24:43] You don't bother to tell me about anything.
[24:45] Kabir, I am not a servant. I am your wife and I have right to oppose your opinion.
[24:51] And if there is still problem then ask sister Aliya to sell that house.
[24:54]  That house is big and you will get huge amount which will resolve all your problems. 
[24:58] Falak, have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind?
[25:01] You know that how much we have attached to that house. That is our ancestors' house. 
[25:06] I am not even ready to mortgage that house and you are asking me to sell that house.
[25:10] Do whatever you want. If you don't want to sell that house then don't sell
[25:13]  but I wont let you sell my house.
[25:59] Falak, you are here? Come, sit.
[26:03]  I have not come here to sit, I have come here to talk to you.
[26:07] What's the matter? 
[26:09] You have asked Kabir to sell my apartment. 
What?
[26:12] Is he selling his apartment? 
[26:16] Don't pretend to be that much innocent. Kabir doesn't know you but I know you very well.
[26:21] You gave that advice of mortgaging this house that day to him because you knew that he wont agree with that.
[26:26] Then you cleverly put the idea to sell his apartment. 
[26:30] Wow sister Aliya wow, you turned out to be more clever than me. 
[26:34] In which tone you are talking to me?
[26:37] Why will I want that? You must have some misunderstanding. 
[26:40] I know everything. Ever since I have taken Kabir from this house you want us to come back to this house so that my head will bow in front of you.
[26:47] If you are thinking that way then it's your mistake. 
[26:52] I wont accept defeat. 
[26:55] I am feeling sympathy for you.
[26:58] You have so many misunderstandings about me. 
[27:02] What will I get by defeating you?
[27:06]  I felt that Kabir's love will change you.
[27:10] But perhaps you can't change throughout your life. 
[27:13] Just leave this topic of changing myself. I will remain like this.
[27:19] Why don't you do a favor on us instead of sympathizing? 
[27:23] Sell this house.
[27:25] It's big and you will get good amount so that all problems of your business will get resolved.
[27:32] What happened? You are speechless?
[27:36] You were claiming so much that day that you will mortgage this house, you will do this and do that but now you are speechless.
[27:48] You know me, 
[27:52] that's why just like you have convinced Kabir to sell his apartment, 
[27:57] forbid him just like that. This will be better for all of us.
[29:16] What the hell?
[29:18]  Madam, I think engine of car has been seized so I will have to take this to workshop.
[29:24] Why don't you check before leaving from home?
[29:27]  Madam, hire another cab.
[29:29] How much fare? 
Give me whatever you want.
[29:35] Take this. 
Thank you.
[30:13] Falak, why are you standing here? What happened?
[30:17] My cab was gone out of order but I have called driver and he must be arriving soon to pick me.
[30:23] I will drop you if you want. Where do you have to go? 
[30:25] No, you will get bothered for no reason. Driver is on his way.
[30:29] Driver will take too long to come, I will drop you. 
[30:33] If you are insisting that much then OK. 
Please come.
[30:46] When did you return Pakistan?
 A few days back.
[30:51] I am really sorry to hear about the death of sister Nazish's husband.
[30:55]  How are sister Nazish and aunt now? 
Much better than earlier.
[30:59] Tell me, how is Kabir? I have heard that he has suffered a huge loss in business.
[31:05] Yes, the business has suffered a huge loss after you took your shares out of business.
[31:11]  I shouldn't say this but you shouldn't have taken back your investment like that.
[31:16] He used to tell you his friend and who does this in friendship? 
[31:21] Actually, I don't want to invest anymore in Pakistan now.
[31:24] I have decided that I will be moving to Canada after some days.
[31:29] That's why I am taking back all my investments here. 
[31:33] Does sister Nawal know about this? 
Yes I have told her.
[31:38] Then what did she say? 
[31:40] She doesn't want to go to Canada. She wants to stay here.
[31:46] I think both of you broke up last time because of this same thing. Right?
[31:50] Hmm, but the situation was different earlier and now it's different.
[31:55] But I am sure that when I will insist she will be convinced.
[31:59]  I must say, sister Nawal is very lucky.
[32:04] That she is about to get a husband like you.
[32:07] Thank you Falak.
[32:11] Please drop me at left side there. I have to go to market to buy some things. 
[32:16] OK there? 
Yes.
[32:25] Sister, cash this cheque and release workers' salary.
[32:34] I have got advance payment of flat.
[32:40] The remaining matter will also get resolved when we will receive balance payment.
[32:47] Let me say one thing Kabir, 
[32:50] I don't know why but I am feeling so much guilty.
[32:57] Both of you furnished that apartment with so much love. 
[33:02] Falak's desires haven't yet fulfilled and we were forced to sell that.
[33:08] You are thinking too much. God will give us more.
[33:16] Kabir, please talk to Falak once,
[33:22]  if she is not agree to come here then don't force her.
[33:29]  Live there where she feels comfortable.
[33:33] I don't want you to face any worry in your life.
[33:40] Sister, Falak will stay where I will live because we have no other option except that. 
[33:46] You don't have to worry. I will handle this matter.
[33:56] I didn't know that she is that much dangerous.
[34:00] I am telling you that she intentionally discussed that mortgage matter 
[34:04] because she knew that Kabir will never agree.
[34:10] Where will we go after selling this apartment? Go back to that hell like house.
[34:14] I was feeling since last few days that something bad is about to happen with me. 
[34:20] This decision of Kabir has pulled shelter from my head and ground from my feet.
[34:25] Listen Falak, I think you should agree with Kabir.
[34:32] What happened to you? What are you talking about? 
[34:34] I have got out of that hell with great difficulty and you are asking me to go back in that hell. 
[34:38] Listen, I agree with you but considering this situation, this will be the right decision.
[34:45] There are servants and Aliya as well. You will get help in taking care of Ilham.
[34:52] She wont do that. She is making my life hell in my own house 
[34:56] then what will she do if I go there. She didn't let me live peacefully here then how will she let me live peacefully there?
[35:00] No, this wont happen and if it happens then talk to Kabir he will handle this himself.
[35:05] This is my biggest problem sister Nawal.
[35:07] Kabir, neither sees nor listens anything. 
[35:11] He just acts like a robot on sister Aliya's instruction. He doesn't have his own say.
[35:17] OK, don't worry and just pray at the moment that the situation of business become better.
[35:36] I was feeling since last few days that something bad is about to happen with me. 
[35:41] This decision of Kabir has pulled shelter from my head and ground from my feet.
[36:01] Greetings Mr. Shehryar, when will I receive that cheque? As I told you that I need that.
[36:12] No, no, one week is too much. I need this within next few days. 
[36:16] Try to get that as soon as possible.
[36:22] OK thank you bye.
[36:33] I know that company is in crisis.
[36:36] You need a big amount. This is not a big amount but this amount will definitely give some help to you.
[36:54] Nawal, I really appreciate that you are concerned.
[36:58] I mean, I am very thankful otherwise who thinks that much for anyone these days?
[37:03] But to be very honest, I can't take this amount from my wife's sister. 
[37:09] My self respect is restricting me to accept this amount.
[37:12] Please take this back. 
You know, Kabir is absolutely right.
[37:17] We can't take this amount. 
[37:19] We can't say anything whether the situation of company will become better or more worse. 
[37:26] So please take this back. 
I am giving this to you happily.
[37:33] Who gives such a huge amount happily these days?
[37:38] And I am sure that Falak must have said something to you. 
[37:41] Yes Falak has told me about the business situation but she didn't ask me to give money this is my own decision 
[37:48] that if I have money so why not to help my family.
[37:53] I have made this decision that I wont take back this cheque so please keep this.
[38:05] Well, Nawal, perhaps you don't have any idea about the situation of our company
[38:11]  and this amount if God forbid if we loose this amount as well then how will we return this huge amount? 
[38:18] I wont ask you to return this amount.
[38:20] You wont ask us to payback this amount but this will be a loan for us.
[38:25] How can we take someone's amount like this? 
[38:28] Kabir I am giving this amount to you happily. What happened to you? Don't you consider me part of your family?
[38:35] Listen, let's assume if I face the same situation, wont you help me?
[38:42]  You will definitely help me that's why I am helping you.
[38:51] Well, I pray to God that you may never face such situation.
[38:56] And the second thing is that I know that you are thinking for us and you are very emotional 
[39:01] but we can't take this. I am sorry and I am very thankful to you.
[39:09] Sister, I have a very important meeting. 
[39:13] You please continue and thank you so much. OK bye.
[39:22] I am so sorry, I didn't want to offend anyone. I just wanted to help you.
[39:27]  Hey, no, we feel good that you came here. 
[39:32] You didn't eat anything. Here is some refreshment. Do you want anything else? 
[39:36] No thanks.
