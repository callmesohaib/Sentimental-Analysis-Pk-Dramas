[00:12] You have met with Shirazi personally? When and why?
[00:18] We were together at lunch yesterday. Me, sister Nawal, mom and he.
[00:21] She has gone to Dubai for two days.
[00:25] What? Without informing you?
[00:29] So suddenly? When did she go?
[00:32] I asked you to come with me. If we would be here together then we would enjoy more.
[00:38] If you would have needed my companionship that much then you wouldn't go there.
[00:40] I have problem with Shirazi.
[00:43] If you want to keep this deal and friendship in tact then cancel your deal with Shirazi.
[00:58] Didn't you talk to him?
[01:00] He knows it very well that we have suffered a huge loss after our branch got burnt.
[01:04] And we had to take someone on board after departure of Mr. Omer Hayat.
[01:12] He has problem with Mr. Shirazi.
[01:15] If he has an issue with Mr. Shirazi then why is he creating problem for us?
[01:19] If he dislikes him then how is this connected to our business?
[01:23] If he is our shareholder then it doesn't mean that he start to enforce his wishes on us.
[01:27] He already knows very well that we are going through a big trauma.
[01:32] What can I say?
[01:34] I have tried my best to convince him but he is not even ready to listen and understand anything.
[01:40] Whatever the case, he can't leave us alone in this difficult time. Let me talk to him.
[01:51] Your dialed number is busy at the moment.
[01:54] His number is busy at the moment.
[02:07] I wasn't expecting such a childish decision from Hamza.
[02:11] I wasn't expecting this from him too.
[02:14] Anyways, don't worry.
[02:18] Let me talk to him myself.
[02:20] He can't make such a big decision alone. We also have invested a huge amount in this project.
[02:27] Any decision will be made only with mutual understanding. You don't have to worry. OK?
[02:32] Let's see.
[02:44] Tell me why do you have crying expressions on your face and your mood is off as well?
[02:49] Aren't you going to parlor?
[02:51] I am going there. Actually, I have so much work load at office these days.
[02:55] That's why you are feeling that way.
[02:58] What do you mean? Haven't you taken leaves from office yet?
[03:01] Not yet because I have so much work at office at the moment.
[03:05] Hey my child, these task keep going on with life. Just take care of yourself.
[03:12] Well, it's your wedding.
[03:14] Sultana?
[03:15] Exactly sister, I also advise her the same thing that she should stay fresh and take care of herself.
[03:21] She shouldn't take work burden.
[03:25] The condition of residents is same as the condition of this house.
[03:28] It doesn't seem that there is a marriage about to be happen in this house.
[03:32] Neither there is a drum or any dance or songs here.
[03:34] What is going on here? I don't understand.
[03:38] Sultana, she is so simple since her childhood.  She wont say anything by herself
[03:45] but I know that every girl wants to get married with a big bang and have fun.
[03:53] And Sulatan, listen to me very carefully that I want to hear the sound of drum beating when I will enter this house tomorrow.
[04:01] OK.
[04:03] My darling Nawal. I pray to God that may you always be happy and be safe from evil sight.
[04:09] Amen. Amen.
[04:10] Let me bring tea for you.
Hey, stop, stop.
[04:14] Why will you make tea? Hmm? You don't have to do that. Ask maid to do that.
[04:19] You are getting married my child. Think my child.
[04:23] Sultana, you should ask Falak to stay here for few days.
[04:26] She always mentions her sister but now she is not here on her sister's wedding event.
[04:31] And it is not appropriate that the girl who is about to get married do household chores.
[04:34] Sister, I have asked her and she will come within a day or two.
[04:38] You please have a chat. I will be back.
[04:41] May God bless her with a happy married life.
[05:03] where are you?
[05:04] Kabir I am waiting at Airport. Driver hasn't come yet.
[05:08] Please pick me if you are free.
[05:13] Falak I am very busy at the moment and I can't come.
[05:16] OK. Then send driver quickly.
[05:19] Driver can't come as well.
[05:21] He has gone to workshop and it will some time. Hire a cab and come home.
[05:25] What? Cab at this moment? Not at all Kabir.
[05:29] Falak please don't disturb me. I am very worried.
[05:34] You can come back just like you went in the cab.
[05:37] What are you saying Kabir?
[05:40] I am just saying what you are listening. Just hire a cab and come home.
[05:45] Let's meet in the evening.
[06:30] Greetings madam.
[06:33] Where were you? Why was your number switched off?
[06:36] I went to pick miss Hafsa from school. My battery got dead and my mobile switched off
[06:41] When I asked you to pick me from airport then was that important to pick Hafsa from school or pick me from airport?
[06:47] Mr. Kabir has assigned this task to pick miss Hafsa from school.
[06:51] Give this to me. Leave it. Get lost from here.
[06:54] They have hired useless people. They don't do anything.
[07:03] Greetings madam, you are back?
[07:06] No, you are seeing my soul.
[07:09] Why are you starring at me? Bring water and coffee to my room and bring this bag as well.
[07:15] Useless people.
[07:23] Hello.
How are you?
[07:27] I am fine
[07:28] Let's have dinner together if you are free?
[07:33] OK
[07:44] Kabir
[08:06] Kabir, why didn't you come to airport to pick me?
[08:08] Do you know, I kept waiting for two hours but you didn't come.
[08:12] I hadn't ask you to wait.
[08:16] How can you be so cruel Kabir?
[08:20] I know that you are angry and doing all this because I left without informing you.
[08:25] Yes, I am angry. I am angry.
[08:29] Falak I gave clarifications to everyone and faced everyone's taunts because of you.
[08:36] I lied first time ever in my life to sister Aliya and brother Toqeer only because of you.
[08:44] You don't fear God by I do have.
[08:51] OK Kabir, I am apologizing so please forget this and stop fighting.
[08:55] Is this a joke? Stop fighting, huh.
[08:59] Falak, if you would have gone to other city in our own country then that would be a different thing.
[09:03] That could be bearable.
[09:06] But you went to Dubai by writing just a single note. You went to Dubai?
[09:10] Falak, even parents don't bear such things.
[09:14] Then how did you expect that I will forgive you?
[09:16] What happened to you Kabir? I got suffocated in this room.
[09:20] I got a chance to breathe freely and to go somewhere but you want that door to close as well.
[09:26] Stop it's enough Falak.
[09:28] You have so much and I have listened so much. Now listen to me.
[09:33] You wont go out from this house without my permission from now onward.
[09:37] Otherwise I will treat you in a bad way.
Now you are doing injustice Kabir.
[09:41] Am I doing injustice? Am I doing injustice?
Why are you making noise? What happened Kabir?
[09:46] Sister you?
Your voice is going downstairs. So much noise, I got worried.
[09:51] What happened that you are talking so loudly? Hmm?
[09:55] Nothing sister, we were just talking.
[09:59] Falak, Kabir, I said to you. Right?
[10:06] Now go and ask maid to bring water for her.
[10:19] What happened?
[10:21] He was angry because I went there alone.
[10:25] He was right Falak. You should take rest instead of going for outing.
[10:32] You shouldn't have gone there if Kabir didn't allow you.
[10:36] I wanted to go somewhere. I asked him and he allowed me to go alone.
[10:42] Why is he getting angry if I went there? First he allows me then doesn't admit that he allowed me.
[10:48] I think he is doing this because of your words. He didn't say anything to me earlier.
[10:52] OK, please stop crying. I will advise him. He wont get angry again. OK take rest now.
[11:02] Let me see, she hasn't brought water yet.
[11:21] I was thinking that we should have planned some celebration.
[11:24] Celebration is must.
[11:27] Celebration? But why?
[11:31] Celebration for your promotion.
[11:34] Shirazi has proved me low in front of you.
[11:37] You must be feeling happy for that.
[11:38] Hamza I feel pain when you talk to me in this tone.
[11:44] And what about my pain?
[11:49] The girl I love, she is standing with my enemy.
[11:54] Hamza I can't even think about giving pain to you.
[11:58] I will never want anything bad happen to you. How can I make you believe?
[12:03] Oh really.
[12:06] Then what was that to invite Shirazi on lunch to celebrate your promotion with him?
[12:14] Do you have any idea that what was my condition when I got this news?
[12:18] But how can you have any idea?
Hamza I didn't invite him there.
[12:26] Wait a minute, how do you know that I met Shirazi when I went for lunch?
[12:32] This world is very small Nawal. Such things never hide.
[12:36] Hamza, I didn't invite him. He came there with a client.
[12:40] I went there with mom and Falak on lunch.
[12:44] Wow, what a wonderful coincidence.
[12:47] At the same place where you went to lunch with your family, Shirazi also came there with client for meeting.
[12:53] So what are you trying to say that I am lying to you?
[12:57] I don't know.
[13:01] You know what Nawal. I have thought so much about it.
[13:06] I think both of us are very different from each other.
[13:09] In fact both of us couldn't know each other at all.
[13:12] No Hamza, you are same and I am same as well.
[13:16] But there is a wall of misunderstanding between us.
[13:21] Eat food, it's getting cold.
[13:35] Kabir, why are you worried?
[13:40] Why were you shouting on Falak like this?
[13:44] You know that Toqeer was so angry and if he would listen your words then he would have been more angry.
[13:51] Listen
[13:54] I don't want to spoil the peace of our house.
[13:59] You are sensible so please be careful.
[14:05] I am doing all this to keep peace in this house.
[14:10] I am sorry sister, it was just because of anger.
[14:17] I know that you are worried because of business condition.
[14:26] But it doesn't mean that we divert business frustration on our family members.
[14:32] You should take care of Falak.
[14:36] Kabir, don't talk to Falak in this tone again, please.
[14:46] Right sister.
[14:47] That much anger is not good for yourself as well.
[14:52] Try to relax.
[15:11] Hamza my child, I have invited both of them here by calling Sultana so that we resolve any misunderstanding if there is any.
[15:20] Because this marriage can't be postponed. That's it.
[15:25] Well, there is nothing left to be discussed now.
[15:28] I wont forbid her to get job in any other company
[15:33] but she will have to give resign from Shirazi group of companies.
[15:41] Now whether you call this my stubbornness, egoistic issue or anything else.
[15:53] Nawal my child, you should also realize the sensitivity of the matter.
[15:57] He is not forbidding you to work in any other company but he has an issue with this company so it's complicated.
[16:02] Get job in some other company. It's not a big deal.
[16:05] You both have to spend life together by understanding each other.
[16:10] My child, if this marriage got postponed or God forbid got cancel
[16:18] then Sultana that will be so humiliating for both families.
[16:23] Yes you are right.
[16:24] These ups and downs will go on. He is not forbidding you to work anywhere else but don't work in this company.
[16:29] Please try to understand.
[16:36] Nawal my child.
[16:44] OK
[16:47] I am working on two projects at the moment which will be completed by next two weeks
[16:53] then I will resign.
[16:55] Here you go.
[16:56] Well done. You exaggerated such a minor thing so much.
[17:01] That's why it is said that we should talk to resolve issued by sitting together.
[17:04] When you will come here after marriage then we both will take revenge from him.
[17:08] Now say sorry to my daughter because you bothered her so much.
[17:11] No aunt, no problem.
[17:33] Nawal.
[17:36] Don't lock yourself in your room again. There are so many things to do.
[17:41] Yes tell me what to do?
[17:42] Well, we have to pick wedding cards and jewelry.
[17:46] Tailor has been calling continuously, we have to give him things.
[17:51] OK, I will pick cards and jewelry tomorrow when I was returning from office and you go to tailor.
[17:58] This laughing face and smile I wanted to see on your face.
[18:03] My girl.
[18:22] By the way you have done so much injustice to me.
[18:25] Which injustice?
[18:27] If you would have agreed earlier then I didn't have to spend so much painful days.
[18:32] Really?
[18:35] How do I tell you about my condition?
[18:39] If I wasn't agreeing then you should have agreed with me.
[18:43] This is a bit difficult for me.
[18:45] You know about it that if anything seems difficult to me then it becomes difficult to do.
[18:51] Can I tell you something?
Hmm.
[18:55] I had already decided that I wont do any job after marriage.
[18:59] What?
[19:01] Then why didn't you tell me?
[19:03] You didn't give me chance to tell you. You gave me an ultimatum
[19:06] that if slave wants to stay alive then will have to obey the order of king.
[19:12] You have bothered me so much by the way.
I didn't bother you.
[19:15] I got hurt by your words. If you have spent your days in pain then I also have spent my so many nights sleepless.
[19:24] Mama and sister are right, I am very quick to do anything.
[19:30] I am sorry Nawal, I have hurt you so much.
[19:34] No, no, no, I wont forgive you that easily.
[19:38] First you will have to take me to dinner then you will have to take me to shopping then go for a long drive because the weather is so beautiful.
[19:44] As you wish. Anything else?
[19:57] I am very tired.
[20:01] Well, wedding cards will come tomorrow.
OK.
[20:04] Did you talk to Hamza? He had to check the measurements of his wedding suit.
[20:08] Yes mama I talked to him.
[20:11] He said that he will go there in the evening.
[20:15] Thankfully, this tension is gone. You know I was so scared because of his stubbornness.
[20:19] Hey mama, why are you worried.
[20:21] As I told you that Nawal is a very sensible girl and she knows how to maintain relationships.
[20:27] I can only pray.
[20:33] Hello, yes I am speaking. Who is there?
[20:39] Brother Haroon, yes, yes.
[20:46] Today?
[20:51] How has that happened? Is Naveen also with him?
[20:55] Naveen my child? What has doctor said?
[21:01] I want to talk to her. Brother Haroon. Let me talk to her once. I want to talk to her.
[21:11] Mama.
[21:12] What happened my child?
[21:14] Mama Raheel has got an accident and Naveen was also with him.
[21:17] What are they saying? Are they alright?
[21:19] She is too young mama.
[21:22] Nothing will happen to him. Don't worry. Let me ask Hamza to book tickets. You go and pack your stuff.
[21:33] Kabir, how long will your anger remain?
[21:36] Until you don't promise to me that you wont do any such thing which will cause embarrassment to me.
[21:44] Party? But Maria it is very difficult for me to go out of the house at the moment. I wont be able to come.
[21:50] No way, no excuses.
[21:52] Well, this party has been arranged for you and if you wont come then there will be no party.
[22:14] I think this color will suit you. This one?
[22:16] Yes.
OK, let's buy this if you like.
[22:19] I am buying dresses of your choice before marriage but I will buy dresses of my choice after marriage.
[22:24] You will wear dresses of choice even after marriage.
[22:27] If you are wearing for me then choice will also be mine.
[22:30] OK then what about my choice?
[22:33] I am your choice. Right?
[22:36] I am just kidding. You can wear whatever you want.
[22:40] I like this one. Take it.
[22:46] It's mama's call. What's up mama?
[22:52] What?
[22:54] What are you saying?
[22:58] Yes I am coming. I am coming.
Is everything alright Hamza?
[23:02] Brother Raheel has got an accident.
What? When and how?
[23:06] Just a while ago.
[23:10] Nawal is it possible that you hire a cab and go home?
[23:14] Hamza, I am going with you. Sister needs us. Let's go.
[23:18] Let's go.
[23:28] Why are you crying sister? God willing everything will be fine.
[23:33] Nothing will happen to brother Raheel.
You will see that he will be alright.
[23:41] I was feeling since last few days that something bad is about to happen and now it has happened.
[23:49] If anything happens to him then I wont be able to live.
Don't worry, nothing will happen to him.
[23:54] He will recover and will be with us within a few days.
[23:57] Are you sure Hamza? Nothing will happen to him?
[24:00] Nothing. Just be patient and pray for him.
[24:04] Absolutely, God never refuses prayers.
[24:09] My daughter has got such a big problem for no reason.
[24:14] Aunt, control yourself, if you will give up then who will take care of sister?
[24:24] How is Naveen?
[24:27] She has got some injuries.
[24:30] Doctor said that she is out of danger.
[24:38] Sister, please control yourself.
[24:42] You have to control yourself for the sake of Naveen. She is alone there. Have you talked to her?
[24:50] Talk to her and give her courage. 
[24:53] She will be broken if she will see you crying like this.
[24:59] Hamza you did good by bringing Nawal with you. Thank you. 
[25:03] No, it's OK aunt.
[25:06] Who called from there? 
A friend of Raheel called her.
[25:11] His number is saved on Nazish's phone. I will share with you.
[25:15]  Hamza, book our tickets so that we can go there.
[25:20] OK.
[25:25] Hamza.
Please stop crying. Please stop crying.
[25:55] Greetings.
[25:59] I am not that bad that you are not responding to my greetings.
[26:04] Greetings.
[26:09] Kabir, what happened?
[26:13]  Neither you talk to me when you leave nor you talk to me when you come back.
[26:20] What difference does it make to you?
What are you talking about? You are my husband.
[26:24] If you wont talk to me and become angry with me then why doesn't that make difference to me? 
[26:31] How long will your anger continue?
[26:34] Until you promise me that you wont do any act like this again which cause embarrassment to me. Till then.
[26:43] I have accepted your desire. 
[26:48] I stay alone in this house whole day.
[26:51] I keep thinking all the time that how can I please you. 
[26:56] Some weird thoughts come to my mind.
[27:00] Please end this anger. I am sorry.
[27:13] OK. If you have realized then anger is over.
[27:23] OK then look at me with smiling face. And tell me with a smile that you are not angry with me.
[27:31] That's great. You are looking tired. Do I make coffee for you? OK.
[27:39] I will bring that.
[27:45] Please book the tickets in first available flight. It's urgent.
[27:50] OK
[27:51] Have you discussed with someone in Canada?
[27:54] Yes, I have talked to my friend and asked him to go there and give me update.
[27:57] Nazish wont get relax until she will reach there. 
[28:01] She is hysterical and we have to take her there very quickly. Please do something.
[28:04] I'm trying
[28:36] Hamza what happened? Why are you sitting here?
[28:40] Nothing.
[28:42] With whom were you talking over phone?
[28:45] That was a friend's call.
[28:48] What was he saying? Is brother Raheel feeling alright?
[28:58] Brother Raheel is no more.
[29:05] Hamza I am so sorry.
 I am unable to understand what to do? 
[29:10] How will I tell this to my sister?
[29:13] How will she be able to bear such a big trauma? I am unable to understand anything.
[29:21] And what about Naveen?
[29:27] You don't have to worry I am with you. We will tell her together. 
[29:31] No, you wont tell her at all.
[29:34] I can't do that. 
[29:36] Nawal please. Sister wont be able to bear all this.
[29:42] You will have to control yourself.
[29:46] Don't tell her anything. 
OK. talk to her yourself.
[30:14] Hamza.
Nawal flight has been confirmed. We are leaving for airport.
[30:21] Did you tell sister?
[30:25] Not yet.
[30:32] Listen, take very good care of her. She needs you at the moment. 
[30:37] Don't leave her alone and stay with her.
[30:42] Take good care of yourself Nawal. I will call you when I reach there. 
OK.
[30:48] Take care.
[31:11] Kabir. Falak.
[31:15] What happened? Where is your phone Kabir? Nawal is calling you for so long. 
[31:20] My phone is here. It's on silent mode.
[31:22] Is everything alright? Is mama alright?
Yes she is alright thanks to God.
[31:28] Nazish's husband has passed away. 
What?
[31:34] When and how? 
Nawal was calling you to tell this. 
[31:37] He got a serious accident last night.
[31:40] This is really a bad news. Let me call Hamza.
[31:43] It's of no use, they have left for Canada.
[31:46] You will call him when he will land there.
[31:50] Kabir please drop me at home. Sister Nawal's condition must be crying badly.
[31:56] Yes take her there. 
OK. Come quickly. I am ready and waiting for you. Come. OK.
[32:18] Nawal my child. You have been sitting here for so long.
[32:25] You didn't sleep whole night and didn't eat anything as well. 
[32:28] You will fall ill because of that. Get up and eat something.
[32:34] How can I eat mom? 
[32:37] Such a big incident has happened. It's like a torment to them.
[32:43] Yes it is. 
[32:46] Pray to God. Everything will be alright. Raheel will recover God willing.
[32:54] No prayer will benefit him now mom.
[33:01] I didn't tell you that brother Raheel has passed away.
[33:06] We all belong to God and we will return to Him.
[33:10] You are telling me now Nawal? You didn't even tell me.
[33:18] I didn't have the courage to tell you mom.
[33:23] Just pray for his forgiveness. 
May God give patience to Nazish.
[33:29] May God forgive him.
[33:33] My child.
[33:38] No mama, it is not possible.
[33:41] This is not possible. Raheel can't leave me.
[33:48] It's God's will my child. 
He promised me to stay with me for ever.
[33:56] How can he leave me like this mama? 
Have courage my child.
[34:10] Take deep breathes. 
Sister please control yourself.
[34:19] Hamza I will die without Raheel. Mama.
[34:27] Think about your daughter. 
[34:31] Sister, if it would be in my authority then I wouldn't let anything happen to your happiness.
[34:37] We can't do anything in front of God's will.
[34:43] God gave him that much life. 
Uncle, uncle. 
[34:47] My child.
[34:53] Sister, not for us just control yourself for her sake. 
[34:59] Stop crying my child.
[35:11] Such a big trauma and that too right before your marriage.
[35:14]  I feel really sad when I think about that.
[35:20] Hey what happened to you Nawal. I considered you so brave.
[35:27] My daughter is very brave. Am I right Nawal?
[35:34] There is something better for us in every act of God and it is revealed after some days.
[35:41] But even then, such a big incident right before marriage. Such a big trauma for sister Nazish and sister Nawal.
[35:52] And after this incident this marriage is not possible.
[36:03] Why it is not possible?
[36:05] It was just an incident happened with God's will. 
[36:08] May God give them patience. Everything will be done as per planning after a couple of months. 
[36:14] God willing.
[36:16] And Nawal, don't worry. You are so nice.
[36:21] God does well to good people and I strongly believe that.
[36:29] Thank you Aliya. 
[36:31] Falak, bring some refreshment.
[36:36] No Falak, don't do that. I have to go somewhere, I will come again later.
[36:42] Falak stay with Nawal for few days. She needs you.
[36:50] Yes, I was thinking the same thing.
[36:54] Call Kabir when you want to come back. 
Yes.
[37:00] Nawal, please take good care of yourself and be courageous.
[37:22] Hello. 
[37:24] I am Kabir.
How are you Kabir?
[37:28]  I am really sorry to hear that.
[37:30] I am in shock ever since I have heard that.
Everyone is feeling like that.
[37:38] How are sister Nazish and Naveen? 
They are alright.
[37:42] Hamza, please tell me if you need any kind of help regarding company matters. And don't worry about here.
[37:52] Thank you. I will tell you if I need anything.
[37:58] You said out of anger that day that our friendship is over but to me you are still my best friend. 
[38:07] Sorry buddy, I said so much out of anger that day.
[38:11] No problem.
I feel really good that you called me.
[38:18] Take care of yourself.
