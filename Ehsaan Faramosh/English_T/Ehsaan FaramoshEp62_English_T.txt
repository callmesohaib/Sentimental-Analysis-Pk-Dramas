[03:24] Who are you?
[03:55] Isn't she the same daughter whom you left crying with your ex-husband for money?
[04:02] You never turned and asked about her.
[04:05] I have no attachment with the child. She isn't mine but Kabeer's daughter.
[04:09] If you don't hold back from your antics, I might change my mind and withdraw the case.
[06:09] Wow.. Very nice..
[06:12] Uncle, give me Ilham so that I can play with her.
[06:16] No.. She'll fall down. She's very young.
[07:19] Oh.. when did you come? Now happy.. Your dad is here..
[07:23] I cannot forget the sight when she was admitted in the hospital.
[07:27] Her small hands were being injected with drips.
[07:33] I couldn't help but do something and take all her pain.
[07:40] If only..
[07:42] Falak realized the same thing. It would have been so good then.
[08:13] I had such important meetings. You didn't come to the office once.
[08:18] If only for a little while, you could have come to the office.
[08:22] Until my daughter is found, I cannot do anything.
[08:29] Please look into the meetings and ask the manager if there's a problem.
[08:38] Kabeer I can understand your condition
[08:41] but if you don't concentrate on your business, how will it work?
[08:49] Qaiser my daughter has been kidnapped. Its not a joke.
[08:58] And until we can find Ilham, I cannot even think about coming to the office.
[09:10] Please pray,
[09:12] wherever Ilham is. She's fine and that I can find her soon.
[09:18] I'll come to the office after that.
[09:27] As God wills. I'll leave now. Take care.
[10:02] I'm going out for some work. I'll be back in a while. Cook something.
[10:08] Alright.
[10:35] Oh my God, she's burning up. What should I do?
[10:44] Sher Khan? Sher Khan.. Sher Khan..
[13:05] How long is the child sick for?
[13:07] Its been three days.
[13:09] Its been three days and you're bringing her right now?
[13:14] Actually doctor, my husband had told me not to, that's why I couldn't bring her
[13:20] .
Your husband said no?
[13:23] What is the child's name?
[13:25] Name? I don't know her name.
[13:32] What do you mean? Isn't she is your child?
[13:34] No. She isn't my daughter.
[13:37] This is my husband's friend's daughter.
[13:40] She is at our house for a few days because her father is out of town.
[13:46] What do you mean? She's your husband's friend's daughter and you don't know her name?
[13:59] See the child is critical. She is dehydrated. We'll have to admit her.
[14:05] Admit?
[14:06] No doctor. I cannot admit her. If my husband comes, he'll hit me.
[14:12] Please give me medicines, I'll give her when I get home.
[14:20] Alright. I'll prescribe the medicine. Give her when you get home.
[14:25] Yes.
[14:26] Stay with her.

[20:36] Mr. Kabeer, she's a woman. Gulmina. She didn't tell anything yet.
[20:42] But she's saying she didn't kidnap her and she'll tell everything truthfully.
[20:47] Please keep her at the station. Don't let her go.
[20:50] I believe she isn't alone. She has more people with her. Its a gang.
[20:55] They didn't even pity a little. My daughter is sick inside.
Mr. Kabeer
[20:59] This is Dr. Nuzhat. She called and informed.
[21:03] Thank you doctor. You've indebted me forever. Our daughter is our happiness.
[21:10] Think of it as that you've returned our happiness back. I'll always be indebted to you.
[21:17] No please. This was my duty. And,
[21:20] We will keep your daughter here tonight because she's weak.
[21:23] Alright. Thank you so much.
[21:31] Mr. Kabeer don't worry. I have two policeman posted here.
[21:35] They'll be here all night in civil dress.
Alright.
[21:39] thank you!
Take care.
[22:51] What happened? Why are you so worried?
[22:54] No. I'm not anxious. Are you mad?
[22:57] Whose this child?
[22:59] She's my friend's daughter. His wife is dead so he's all alone.
[23:04] He has gone out of town for a few days so he asked us to take care of her for a few days.
[23:55] Where are you Khawar? I've been calling you since long.
[23:58] Gulmina went somewhere with the child.
[24:02] I don't know where she went.
[24:05] If boss finds out he'll kill me.
[24:09] Please do something. Ask someone.
[24:12] Alright. I'm waiting. Tell me fast.
[24:20] Yes sir? How are you?
[24:23] I'm fine. Where are you? In the hospital or the police station?
[24:29] I'm at my house. Why would I be at the hospital or the police station?
[24:33] What? Don't you know yet?
[24:36] What do I not know?
Kabeer's daughter has been found.
[24:43] What?
[24:46] When? Who told you?
[24:49] She was found a little while ago.
[24:51] She's in the hospital right now. I heard the news on a news channel.
[24:55] The social media is flooded with news. I thought I'd talk to you.
[25:02] Listen, you should be in the hospital.
[25:06] Take Ms. Falak and get to the hospital fast and ask Ms. Falak to spend the night at the hospital with the child.
[25:13] These small things will help the case.
[25:17] Alright. I'll call you later.
[26:01] Hamza? What happened? Are you alright?
What?
[26:07] Yes I'm fine.
You don't seem fine. Did something happen?
[26:11] The manager called. He said we have to go to Dubai.
[26:15] When?
[26:18] Maybe tonight. You'll come with me. We'll go to Canada from there.
[26:26] Hamza.. How can I go with you?
[26:30] We don't know anything about Ilham. Her custody case is going on. How can we go?
[26:37] Its important to go, that's why I'm asking you.
[26:40] And as far as the case is concerned, I'll talk to the lawyer, he'll handle it.
[26:46] Hamza please, can this tour not be postponed. We'll find Ilham until then.
[26:54] When I have her, we'll go together. The case is going on, you know..
[26:59] And I don't trust those people at all. I cannot leave my daughter with them.
[27:04] Do as you're told. I don't have time to explain everything.
[27:39] Why did you kidnap the child?
[27:41] Sir I didn't kidnap the child. I can swear.
[27:48] I just took the girl to the hospital for a checkup.
[27:52] Don't force me to force you.
[27:55] If you didn't kidnap the child, who did? Who brought her to you?
[28:01] She's my husband's friend's daughter. He brought her to me.
[28:07] Her father is out of town for a few days.
[28:11] Do you think I'm a fool? I know women like you very well. Tell me everything clearly.
[28:19] Nothing will happen then.
[28:20] How many times should I tell you? I told you the truth. I'm not lying.
[28:28] The bike that kidnapped the child, it came to your neighborhood.
[28:34] We've seen everything on the CCTV. And the guy who kidnapped her,
[28:39] This means that you have a full gang. Tell me everybody's name.
[28:47] I'll take your name out of the list. I promise you'll not be punished.
[28:54] Sir how many times should I tell you, I have no gang. You must be mistaken.
[29:03] She will not speak like this.
[29:06] Torture her.
[29:08] Sir, I'm not at fault. Please let me go home.
[29:13] Please come home with me and ask my husband. You'll find yourself that I'm telling the truth.
[29:21] Alright. Take her address.
[29:25] And give your husband's mobile number
[29:29] I don't remember the mobile number. I forgot the phone at home. Please come with me.
[29:38] You can ask my husband, Sher Khan yourself.
[29:54] What did she tell?
[29:57] Nothing. She said she's alone and she has no support.
[30:03] She said she didn't kidnap the child.
[30:07] She says its her husband's friend's daughter who has gone out of town.
[30:12] She's lying. Completely.
[30:16] Please don't trust her. Do whatever it takes but make her tell me. Don't leave her like this.
[30:25] Don't worry. We know what we have to do. Rest assured.
[30:42] I need tickets for Dubai.
[30:45] What? The flights are full.
[30:49] Do whatever it takes, I need the first available flight in the morning. Any airline.
[30:55] Okay. I'm waiting.
[30:58] Hamza, dear, are you going somewhere?
[31:01] Yes. I'm going to Dubai.
[31:04] All of a sudden? Is everything alright.
[31:06] I had an important meeting. I thought I'd take Falak along and then we'll go to Canada to see Nazish from there.
[31:14] So..
[31:17] Excuse me? I have a call. Hello?
[31:23] Strange..
[32:59] How long is the trip for?
[33:02] Its not confirmed but it might take 10-15 days. Depends upon the meetings. Maybe more.
[33:10] By the way, when are you coming to Canada?
[33:12] I have no plans yet. I'll tell you if I have a plan.
[33:16] Alright. Falak? Its time for the flight. Come.
[33:28] Sir, the police is outside. They're asking for you.
[33:48] Alright, go. Call them.
Alright.
[33:54] Why is the police here again?
[33:58] Inspector you?
[34:00] Hello.
Hello.
[34:02] The child has been found.
[34:15] Are you telling the truth? Is my daughter found? How is she?
[34:20] She's absolutely fine and she's with her father.
[34:34] We couldn't contact you so I had to come to tell you.
[34:40] Thank you inspector. Thank you very much. Thank God you heard me. My daughter is found.
[34:47] Did you find out who kidnapped her?
[34:51] No. We couldn't find who kidnapped her. But we're investigation. 
[34:56] Alright, I'll take your leave.
[34:57] Yes, thank you.
[35:11] Hello? 
[35:14] What? Is the flight canceled?
[35:20] But why? I didn't get any cancellation message.
[35:28] Alright. Fine. Okay.
[35:37] What happened?
[35:39] The flight to Dubai has been canceled.
[35:42] Strange. It has never happened.
[35:46] Yes. I don't know whats the reason.
[36:05] Come. Come..
[36:12] Oh baby.. 
[36:15] You? What are you doing here?
[36:18] I'm here to take my daughter.
[36:21] What happened my dear? Did you miss mom? Its alright. Mom is here. You'll stay with mom now.
[36:28] What do you mean she'll stay with you now?
[36:30] After the incident, do you still think you'll keep her? You've lost the right.
[36:36] No. You cannot take her. See how she's crying.
Step back!
[36:39] You don't have the right to keep her. 
Kabir... Kabir!
[36:43] Its because of you she was in hell. Look how weak she's become..
[36:48] Are you mad? Give her to me!
Leave me!
[36:52] Give her to me! Give her!
[36:56] She's my daughter. I have a right on her. Not the two of you
[36:59] What right are you talking about?
[37:02] What right are you talking about Falak? You let go of all your rights willingly.
[37:08] Nobody forced you. Have you lost your memory?
[37:15] I made a mistake but I'll resolve it now. I'll take my daughter along.
[37:25] After what you did, after the incident, its proven that you cannot take care of her. 
[37:33] I'm taking my daughter along. I'll care for her, myself.
I'm warning you.
[37:38] I'm warning you Falak.
[37:41]  You cannot take her along unless the court decides. Say whatever you want to say in the court.
[37:46] Alright. We'll meet in the court. But you also understand this.
[37:51] The court will decide in my favor.  
[37:53] It will never take a child away from her mother. They'll never decide in favor of a step mother 
[37:58] who cannot take care of her.
[38:02] Are you done with whatever you had to say? 
[38:06] Leave quietly and don't come back again.
[38:11] You're doing wrong.
[38:13] Get lost.
[38:15] I'll see all of you!
[38:46] What? What are you saying? Sher Khan's wife has been caught? But how?
[38:53] And Sher Khan let her go? 
[38:56] Listen to me. Make him go underground right now or send him out of town.
[39:01] His wife can go to hell. You're worried about his wife 
[39:05] and what about the police hovering on my head because of you?
[39:13] Do as I say. Right now. Hide him anywhere. 
[39:19] Make him go underground. Do anything it takes.
[39:21] Do you know what will happen if he's caught? 
[39:25] He shouldn't be caught by the police by any means!
[39:30] Okay.
[39:32] What happened Hamza? 
[39:35] Who shouldn't be caught by the police? Who were you talking to?
