[01:25] Oh, Kabeer, you? You're back early.
[01:28] Where were you?
[01:32] I had some work. Why? What happened now?
[01:35] Have you forgotten you have a small daughter? Are you so careless?
[01:40] You left your daughter and went to run errands.
[01:45] Noor is here. I told her to take care of her. Why is she here for?
[01:49] Its your responsibility to take care of her or someone else?
[01:52] Enough Kabeer. I should know what has happened?
[01:56] Ilham was unwell. I took her to the hospital in an emergency.
[02:01] I've been calling you. Your phone has been off.
[02:05] Yes, the battery died. Its not the end of the world. You were there, you took her to the hospital.
[02:12] And as it is Kabeer, I take care of her for the whole day. What if you took care of her for a day?
[02:17] Falak do you even realize?
[02:19] How are you talking to me? Rather than accepting your mistake, you're putting it on me.
[02:24] Enough Kabeer. Its enough.
[02:27] Have you forgotten, I'm not your maid but your wife. I have a life of my own.
[02:32] What do you want? Should I stay at home all the time?
[02:34] There's a limit to everything and you'll not cross your limit the next time!
[02:37] Falak!
[02:56] What happened? Hit me now. Why did you stop? Hit me now.
[03:00] I should know what you have in your heart for me.
[03:03] You have so much pent up anger!
Falak..
[03:15] Do you have any idea how worried Kabeer and I were.
[03:18] We had to take Ilham straight to emergency.
[03:21] Do you even know how much your negligence would have cost you?
[03:25] Please Falak, correct yourself.
[03:28] Don't blame others for your mistakes.
[03:31] Enough. Whats wrong? Why are you talking like Kabeer? I don't go out every day.
[03:36] I had some important work that's why I had to step out for a while.
[03:39] Then why didn't you tell before leaving and why was your phone off?
[03:42] Mam, Ilham is up.
[03:47] Go and take care of your daughter. Give her medicine on time. I'm leaving, I'm getting late.
[03:59] Why are you standing and looking at my face? Couldn't you take care of a baby?
[04:15] Sir the company has rejected our demand for an inquiry.
[04:19] Do whatever it takes Mr. Qureshi. I need this contract back.
[04:23] Sir, I had asked you to meet Mr. Qaiser but you said no yourself.
[04:30] There's no use meeting with him.
[04:32] Sir after you left for Canada, the work progress slowed down.
[04:35] We couldn't build the facility on time. Its our fault. The company is right.
[04:43] If we file a case against them.
[04:44] Sir I discussed with our legal team. They said we'd be wasting our time and money both.
[04:52] The points on the basis of which the contract was pulled off, they're absolutely valid.
[04:57] Alright. You leave, I'll see.
[04:59] Okay sir.
[05:06] I will never let you win.
[05:11] I don't say anything because you're not well and you might get even more worried
[05:18] but I'm surprised that,
[05:20] sister Nawal didn't tell you anything. She didn't even tell you what happened yesterday.
[05:25] Yesterday?
[05:27] What happened yesterday?
[05:30] Kabeer hit me in front of sister Nawal.
[05:34] What?! How dare he hit you?!
[05:38] I swear mom, I didn't say a word.
[05:44] I apologized.
[05:47] This has been increasing every day. Something happens everyday.
[05:51] I don't say anything. He knows,
[05:54] who will come after me to ask and question. He thinks I'm an orphan.
[05:59] I'm alive right now. I'm your mother.
[06:05] How dare he hit you? I would break his arm.
[06:10] Had I known he would treat you like a caveman after he takes you from here, I wouldn't have let him.
[06:19] Let it be mom. We cannot judge a person's traits by his face.
[06:23] Get up. Get up and come with me. I'll go and ask him right away. He made such tall claims.
[06:30] Has he forgotten everything? Come on, Falak.
[06:38] Where are you going?
[06:40] Yesterday, Kabeer slapped Falak in front of you.
[06:44] And you didn't event tell me.
[06:46] How dare he? Why didn't you bring back Falak that very instant Nawal!
[06:51] Kabeer did not slap Falak. She's lying.
[07:01] What are you saying?
[07:03] I'm right mom.
Speak up!
[07:07] Kabeer misbehaved with me in front of you. Why are you trying to save him?
[07:13] Falak neither Kabeer misbehaved with you nor did he slap you.
[07:16] In fact you were misbehaving with him. You provoked him.
[07:21] Why did you leave Ilham and go?
[07:23] Didn't you know she was unwell?
[07:26] You show such careless behavior and you expect the other person to not be angry.
[07:31] Falak, what am I hearing?
[07:35] Mom, this is a lie.
[07:37] I don't tell you anything because you people will never believe me.
[07:42] I have realized today, why do we need blood relations.
[07:47] They believe you and support you when you need them.
[07:51] You people have turned me into a liar in a second.
[07:54] Tell me why would I lie? What will I get by lying?
[07:58] Falak you know very well that I don't support wrong.
[08:02] This time you're wrong. I was there. I heard everything.
[08:08] Had you been my sister by blood would you have said the same thing?
[08:11] You would have gone with me and asked him why he did that? I am wrong.
[08:17] I have no complaints from you and mom. I'll not come back here again.
[08:21] Mom let it be. I've realized. No matter how much I try..
[08:26] I will never be her sister or your daughter..
[08:31] Let her go mom. She turns us into strangers in a second. We brought her up.
[08:37] You come with me.
[09:15] What is it? Are you worried?
[09:19] I'm thinking about Falak and Kabeer.
[09:22] Day by day the arguments between them are increasing.
[09:27] I don't know what Falak is made of.
[09:30] She doesn't bother about her daughter or her husband.
[09:34] Aaliya, some people are like that.
[09:38] No matter how much you make them understand, their habits will never change.
[09:45] Unfortunately Falak is one of them.
[09:48] I will just tell you to let her be.
[09:55] You know her habits.
[09:57] What if she blames everything on you?
[10:02] You're the limit.
[10:05] Rather than telling me how to help them decrease their arguments, you're scaring me.
[10:11] Aaliya their arguments will only end when God will guide Falak to the right path.
[10:18] Falak isn't one of those girls who would like to settle down. Why don't you get that?
[10:24] No matter how much Kabeer tries, their arguments will never end
[10:30] What are you saying?
[10:32] Come on, you know they are a mismatch.
[10:37] Both of them have different habits.
[10:44] A person marries to get peace and if there's no peace, a marriage is useless.
[10:56] I am worried about Ilham.
[11:01] She's not even looking after her.
[11:04] She isn't worried about her daughter.
What do you mean?
[11:09] When the child grows up and sees her parents fighting, how will she be affected?
[11:15] Have you ever thought about it?
[11:18] Aaliya such children are never mentally stable.
[11:22] God forbid if this happens.
[11:25] Just pray that may God guide Falak.
Amen.
[11:36] I heard everything you people said.
[11:40] You people feel so much pain for me.
[11:44] I am teary eyed listening to all this. You worry about me so much.
[11:50] Both of you want peace in this house? I'll tell you how we can be peaceful.
[11:57] Get your stuff together and leave the house.
[12:04] If you want to see Kabeer and me happy, we'll be happy if you both leave. As it is,
[12:11] both of you make us argue a lot. We will not fight then.
[12:16] What nonsense is this?
[12:18] Whatever you're hearing. Am I wrong?
[12:24] Are you in your senses? Look at the tone of your voice.
[12:26] I'm in my senses. In fact I should have talked like this ages ago.
[12:34] You want us to be peaceful. Be good and leave.
[12:40] Falak I'm telling you to not cross your limits.
[12:42] What did I say to upset you?
[12:45] He's your only brother. Don't you want him to be happy?
[12:49] Don't you want Kabeer to be happy?
[12:52] Its the limit Falak. This house belongs to all of us.
[12:56] You're mistaken.
[13:00] My husband spent money to build this house. My husband. Its my house. You have forcibly taken over.
[13:09] Mind your tongue. Mind it..
Toqueer don't argue with her. Come with me.
[13:18] Where are you going inside? Go that way. That's where you go out from.
[13:45] How dare you talk to my brother and sister Aaliya like this?
[13:49] Kabeer they want to separate us..
Enough!
[13:56] Its enough. Not a word more.
[14:00] I heard everything myself. No more lies will work Falak.
[14:11] Will you throw them out? You'll show them out?
[14:15] Kabeer listen to me. Kabeer its not that..
[14:17] I made the biggest mistake of my life marrying you.
[14:21] But then I made an even bigger mistake bringing you back in this house.
[14:26] Falak you don't deserve to be in this house. Come on.
[14:30] Leave me. Where are you taking me?
[14:31] I'm taking you back to your house. You'll not live here now.
[14:35] Kabeer what are you doing? Leave me. I'll live here.
[14:39] I'm not going anywhere.
I've never been so insulted in my life.
[14:47] sister Aaliya, please don't cry. She'll not live here.
[14:51] I'm sending her back to her house.
[14:54] Nothing is important to me than your respect.
[14:58] Get out. Go back to your house.
[14:59] Don't throw me out. Please listen to be Kabeer.
[15:03] If you want to live here, you'll have to apologize to my brother and sister in law or else there's no place for you in this house.
[15:10] Kabeer please stop it. You've made enough spectacle.
[15:13] No brother. I cannot be quiet all the time.
[15:17] She will have to apologize today or else she can go. There's no place for her in this house.
[15:22] Kabeer please forgive me. Please..
[15:27] sister Aaliya, brother Toqueer please forgive me. I don't know what happened to me. I blabbered because I was angry. Next time,
[15:33] I'll not even say a word. Please ask Kabeer to not throw me out. Please forgive me.
[15:38] brother Toqueer, please ask him to forgive me.
[16:28] Nawal, call Falak and ask about her.
[16:34] Mom, stop pampering her.
[16:39] You know how emotional she is. She left in anger.
[16:44] I don't know how she'll honor her relationships.
[16:49] I am worried about her house.
[16:51] Mom, she wants you to turn a blind eye to her mistakes.
[16:57] You should make her understand to stop going outside and stay at home and look after Ilham.
[17:05] I'm scared that if Falak keeps on doing this, her life will be difficult in the future.
[17:23] Go out. Go back to your house.
Don't throw me out Kabeer. Kabeer listen to me.
[17:29] If you want to live here, you'll have to apologize to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer.
[17:33] Otherwise there's no place for you in this house.
[17:37] sister Aaliya, brother Toqueer please forgive me. I don't know what happened to me. I'll not say a word next time.
[17:43] Please forgive me. Ask Kabeer to not throw me out. Please forgive me.
[17:54] I will avenge my insult. I'll not forgive you.
[17:59] Falak you're fighting this battle alone now. Nobody is yours.
[18:04] Don't think about anyone. I'll do what I want to do.
[18:21] Hello aunty.
Hello Hamza. How are you?
[18:25] I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine, thank God.
[18:28] Where is Nawal? I called her many times but she didn't answer.
[18:32] Nawal isn't home.
[18:35] Really? Where did she go?
Nawal must be in the office.
[18:40] Office? Which office?
[18:43] Didn't Nawal tell you?
[18:47] Actually she has joined Kabeer's office.
[18:52] Really?
[18:54] She didn't tell me anything.
[18:56] She joined since the past two weeks. Come inside I'll get you tea.
[19:01] No auntie. I'll come some other day and have tea as well.
[19:04] I'll leave now.
Alright. As you wish.
[19:08] Bye.
Bye.
[19:52] Hamza, you here?
[19:54] If I ask the same thing from you. What are you doing here?
[19:57] Hamza I was about to tell you.
Tell me? When?
[20:02] You have been working here for the past two weeks and you didn't even mention it to me.
[20:09] Now right now, resign and come with me.
[20:13] Hamza..
[20:15] You go. We'll meet in the evening and talk.
No.
[20:20] We will talk right now and you will resign today.
Hamza I can't do that.
[20:27] This is not professional at all.
[20:30] I have a commitment. I cannot leave a job because you said so.
[20:33] You'll teach me professionalism now?
[20:36] You're Hamza Hashim's fiance.
[20:38] You don't have to work for a cheap company. And if someone says something to you..
[20:44] Tell me, I'll handle them. You come with me.
This is my office.
[20:52] You don't have to create a scene here. Leave quietly.
[20:59] You are a very cheap man.
[21:03] When I didn't invest in your company, you gave my fiance a job?
[21:13] I have not seen a cheap man like you in my life.
[21:17] She will not come to the office from tomorrow.
[21:20] Come.
[21:21] Hamza, I'm not coming with you right now. You leave.
[21:29] I will not give him what he wants from me, through you.
[21:38] Nawal, you come with me. You have no work here. Come.
[21:43] I'm warning you for the last time.
[21:56] Leave my office. Now.
Alright.
[22:02] I'll see how long she works for you.
[22:15] I'm so sorry. This is so embarrassing. I really..
[22:21] Nawal its all good. Relax.
[22:32] Nawal..
Yes mom?
[22:36] Hamza came over. Didn't you tell him about your job?
[22:39] I talked to him. I've told him.
[22:44] That's why..
[22:46] I think he didn't like you hiding your job from him.
[22:50] Mom, I didn't hide.
[22:52] I didn't get a chance to tell him.
[22:54] Now that you've told him, I hope his anger calms down.
[23:01] How are you feeling now?
[23:03] I'm fine. Did you talk to Falak?
[23:06] No.
[23:10] I'll call her myself.
[23:13] I'll try.
[23:16] I just want to talk. She isn't answering my calls.
[23:20] What happened? Nawal? Are you worried?
Nothing much. Its just,
[23:27] Hamza doesn't like me working for Kabeer.
Hamza?
[23:34] Since when did Hamza become so conservative?
[23:37] Mom we never know whats hidden inside a person.
[23:43] We see people change color gradually.
[24:12] Give her to me mam, I'll give her milk.
[24:14] No. Keep this here and go check on the kitchen. I'll handle.
[24:19] Alright.
Are you hungry? Are you?
[24:35] We'll have milk now. Okay?
Hello.
[24:40] Hello.
Hello my cutoo baby. How are you?
[24:46] Where is Falak?
I think she went out for some work.
[24:50] Out? Did you call her?
[24:54] No. I thought she'd come back in a while. She'll be back soon.
[25:00] What happened dear?
[25:17] Hello?
Hello?
[25:20] Can I talk to Falak?
Falak is busy shooting right now.
[25:25] What did you say? Shoot?
[25:31] Which shoot?
[25:32] She's shooting for a drama. Please call back after an hour.
[25:36] Who is this speaking?
This is Maria.
[25:52] Do you even realize how much I've been worried because of this?
[25:57] Hamza I don't understand why are you weighing this small thing so much?
[26:00] Small? Is this a small matter for you?
[26:04] This is a big issue for me. But oh well. Its good that you've resigned.
[26:13] I didn't resign and nor do I intend you.
[26:18] Why didn't you? I told you I don't like you working there.
[26:24] You know Kabeer and I have clashes and yet you're working for him
[26:29] Hamza you'll have to understand. Kabeer isn't a stranger.
[26:33] He is my sister's husband and we're family.
[26:36] Secondly they requested me because they needed someone.
[26:40] I agree and I don't think you should have a problem with it.
[26:44] Tell me one thing. Why are you always standing with my competitors?
[26:50] First Shirazi and now Kabeer.
[26:53] Hamza I cannot resign right now. Let the company be a little stable and then I'll resign. Okay?
[27:03] No. You will resign right now.
[27:07] Hamza try and understand. I cannot resign right now. The company will be in trouble.
[27:13] Why do you worry so much for him?
[27:14] Kabeer is my sister's husband and my sister is worried about her circumstances.
[27:19] You know much damage Kabeer made me incur?
[27:22] My company suffered a loss worth millions because of him. 
[27:25] The medicine company I was working with, for the past six months,
[27:29] that company canceled their contract with me and gave it to Kabeer and his friend.
[27:33] This is your personal matter. Don't involve me. And don't force me to resign.
[28:05] Where were you?
[28:07] I went for some important work.
[28:09] Tell me what important work you went for. I want to know.
[28:12] I told you it was important. Why do I need to go into details for everything?
[28:17] You're lying. You were on a shoot. I talked to Maria.
[28:22] Kabeer whats wrong, how are you talking to me?
[28:25] I told you not to model and yet you went there.
[28:29] Kabeer I'm not modeling, I'm acting. There's a huge difference. 
[28:33] As it is, I didn't want to do it but the opportunity was good.
[28:37] I couldn't say no. There's no reason to say no. I'm getting fame and money, why should I say no?
[28:43] Falak who will take care of Ilham?
[28:45] The maid is there. She'll take care of her. 
[28:47] As it is, I don't have to go everyday. Its just two days in a week. You can manage this, Kabeer.
[28:53] You didn't even bother to tell me?
[28:56] Nobody asks sister Aaliya. All restrictions are for me.
[29:00] She doesn't like anybody questioning her. All this is for me.
[29:04] Where did you bring in sister Aaliya in between all this?
[29:06] Why won't I mention? We live in the same house and yet there are different rules for both of us. 
[29:10] If I can't go anywhere, she won't either.
[29:13] She should stay at home, why does she go to the office?
[29:15] If you want to work, join a good workplace. I will not restrict you.
[29:21] But I cannot allow you to model or become an actor. 
[29:24] We have a family and we're conservative about it. Women in our family do not model or act.
[29:32] Falak finish this drama and find a good job.
[29:36] When you dislike my field so much, you don't feel bad when I travel in a cab.
[29:43] How many times have I told you Kabeer that I need my own car?
[29:47] How many times have I told you Falak, the situation isn't good.
[29:50] I cannot get you a new car. You'll have to wait.
[29:54] How much should I wait? The cab breaks down. I get late if I have to go somewhere.
[30:00] Stop going out. Stay at home and take care of Ilham. 
[30:04] Why do you have to go out unnecessarily?
[30:07] I expect this from you. Don't do anything.
[30:23] Will you have this a little? 
[30:27] Sakina, ask Falak to come down for dinner.
Alright.
[30:37] What nonsense is it? Why do I have to take care of her all day?
[30:43] They restrict me for everything. 
[30:47] My life is a living hell. Did I get married for this?
[30:55] What is it with you now?
Mam, they're calling you for dinner?
[30:59] I don't want to eat.
What?
[31:02] Can't you hear me? Tell them I don't want to eat.
Yes mam.
[31:07] Kabeer should know that I'm upset.
[31:19] Have something to eat and then you can sleep.
[31:21] Mam, mam Falak said she didn't want to eat.
[31:27] Kabeer, go and call Falak. I think she's upset.
Let her be.
[31:36] She'll eat if she angry. Nobody is going to call her now.
[31:41] Please start, brother.
[32:07] Whats wrong with you now? Be quiet.
[32:12] Sakina? Sakina?!
[32:19] Sakina?
Yes mam.
[32:23] Take her. Take her to the other room and put her to sleep.
[32:47] He's sleeping so peacefully. He doesn't bother whether his wife is alive or dead.
[33:01] Falak? Falak look at her, she's crying.
[33:06] You should look at her. She's your daughter too. Not mine alone.
[33:12] Falak, what is wrong with you? I have to go to the office tomorrow and wake up early.
[33:17] I go to work as well.
[33:20] Falak, she's hungry.
Kabeer, attend to her yourself.
[33:24] Alright, come. Come. dear. You're hungry.
[33:31] No. No.. Come. Lets go.
[33:53] Farooq sir, bring me the finance sheets of the last quarter. 
[33:57] Okay, thank you.
[34:02] Nawal?
Yes Aaliya, tell me.
[34:06] These are the files with the details of all the suppliers of Kabeer Foods. Please check and let me know.
Sure.
[34:14] And, this is the cheque. Get it deposited through any rider as soon as possible in Toqueer's account.
[34:20] Sure thing.
[34:27] Falak? You?
[34:36] Is everything alright?
[34:38] Yes everything is alright.
[34:40]  I was free at home so I thought I'd come to the office and see whats going on.
[34:50] Oh wow. The cheque is in Toqueer's name.
[34:56]  You're sharing money here.
[35:00] Do you know? I was telling Kabeer to have my car changed 
[35:06] but he said the company's financial situation wasn't good.
[35:10] But I should praise you sister Aaliya. 
[35:12] You're stuck to this company like a parasite.
[35:19] How are you talking Falak? Is this how you talk to your elders?
[35:23] I'm right.
[35:25] The company isn't in a good situation. We're going bankrupt. 
[35:29] But something else is going on here. She's depositing such a big amount in her husband's account.
[35:34] I'm telling you sister Nawal. This has been happening and has brought the company into financial crisis.
[35:39] Falak, enough of your nonsense. 
[35:41] You cannot blame anyone for anything so big.
[35:45] You come with me.
I'm not accusing anyone, sister Nawal. 
[35:48] It isn't. You're a big businesswoman.
[35:52] We're suffering because of her. My life is a living hell. 
[35:57] She plucked me from the heavens and threw me in hell.
[35:59] She took away my apartment from me. My house. She has destroyed my life.
[36:04] Aaliya please don't focus on what she says. Please leave. I'll handle her.
[36:09] You make her understand. This company is running because of us. 
[36:14] Had I not asked you, would you invest in this company?
[36:18] If you invested in this company, I have a right on it as well. 
[36:22] They've been putting me off for the past months. 5 months, 6 months..
[36:25] The company goes bankrupt if I ask for money but you'll have money to transfer them to your husband's account?
[36:33] Falak, I didn't invest for you but for Kabeer.
[36:44] What do you mean?
[36:44] I mean Kabeer needed an investment, his company needed it. That's why I invested.
[36:54] So you didn't do it for your sister, what is our relation then? 
[36:57] You didn't do it for me? You should be ashamed.
[37:03] She cares for you people more than me.
[37:06] Falak what are you saying? What has happened to you?
[37:10] I'm absolutely right. What did you do that you turned my own sister against me?
[37:15]  What did you say to poison her?
[37:19] Falak, mind your language. This is my office. Don't create a scene here. Go home.
[37:25] Whatever the problem is, discuss with Kabeer.
[37:28] Why should I leave? This office is running on my sister's money.
[37:32] Who are you to throw me out?
[37:34] Falak I'm asking you to be quiet. You're misbehaving with Aaliya. Quiet!
[37:38] Have you lost your mind?
[37:40] Yes I've lost my mind. They've made me mad.
[37:43]  I don't want to live with these illiterate people.
[37:48] Aaliya, I'm so sorry. She must have something in her mind. Don't take it seriously. She's young.
[37:58] I'm so sorry. Aaliya..
[38:05] Aaliya, please stop crying. Please.
[38:11] I don't understand what have I done to her?
[38:15] I treated her like my younger sister. I don't know why she is so turned against me.
[38:21] I'll make her understand. She'll apologize. Don't worry.
[38:31] sister Aaliya.. What happened?
[38:39] I'm asking you what happened? Tell me. Why are you crying?
[38:45]  Nawal?
