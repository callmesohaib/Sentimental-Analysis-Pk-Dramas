[02:06] Aaliya?
[02:08] Aunty, hello. How are you?
I'm well. Long time no see. Please sit.
[02:16] What is all this?
[02:17] I was coming to your place after such a long time so I couldn't come empty handed.
[02:21] These are sweets for Kabeer's engagement.
[02:25] Really? Hows the family?
They're a very nice family. The girl is also very nice.
[02:31] The wedding is this month only and you'll have to come. You'll have to bring Hamza as well.
[02:35] We'll definitely come.
[02:38] Will you have tea or coffee?
[02:39] Nothing at all. You know I'm coming from the office and we're drinking tea or coffee there everyday.
[02:44] This cannot be. You'll have to eat something.
[02:47] First tell me where is Hamza? How is his business going on these days?
[02:50] Hamza is absolutely fine. He's very busy. Business is going great. He's always in the office.
[02:54] And what about Nazish?
[02:57] She's absolutely fine. Thank God.
Good. Should I say something?
[03:02] You should get Hamza married now. How long will you be alone?
[03:06] I'm tired of telling him but he puts me off saying its a new business and there are tons of responsibilities.
[03:12] And he cannot take anymore responsibilities.
[03:14] What is this? A wife isn't a burden. Once they have a life partner, they share so many of their responsibilities.
[03:20] Yes but how to explain it to this boy. By the way you're very social. You meet a lot of people.
[03:26] Find a girl for him.
[03:29] By the way,I do have a girl in mind. Very smart and very decent.
[03:34] Talk to Hamza once and if he agrees we'll meet the girl's family.
[03:39] I'll make him agree. You talk to him. I'm sure things will fall into place.
Alright.
[03:45] Now please allow me to leave.
Not at all. You cannot leave like this. Neelofar. Neelofar..
[03:51] Aaliya is here after so many days. Get her some tea or coffee, biscuits, pastries.
[03:56] Don't bother with too much. Get me a cup of coffee. And hurry up please, I have to rush.
[03:59] Now tell me more. We haven't talked since ages. Whats up these days?
[04:03] I'm short on time today. You should come to our hotel. We'll have lunch or dinner together and talk for long.
[04:16] Sultana, I don't understand what you're doing. You left Nawal out and got Falak engaged before her.
[04:24] You brought her up but now you'll get her married too?
Sister in law..
[04:31] She is my daughter and I'll get her married too.
[04:34] Get back in your senses. Nawal is your daughter by blood. She's elder than her.
[04:39] She should be married first. Its her right.
[04:46] Oh well.
Hello.
[04:49] Hello my dear.
How are you aunt?
[04:55] Hello. I'm fine.
Mom, I'm going to my room.
[04:59] Alright.
[05:04] I think you cannot see anything.
[05:08] You have a witch in your house and its eating everything slowly.
Sister in law..
[05:15] You don't know Falak. She's a very nice, well mannered girl.
[05:22] I brought her up. She isn't like that.
I feel as if you don't know her.
[05:27] Open your eyes before its too late.
[05:36] When is brother coming in?
The weather in Islamabad didn't suit me. I got ill.
[05:42] That's why I got here early. But he'll come tomorrow. His flight is at 2pm.
[05:50] Then its alright. I'll give time for day after tomorrow.
You're being stubborn without any reason.
[05:55] Its not so important for us to go there.
[05:58] Why isn't it? I'll not go there without my younger brother and sister in law.
[06:04] When you were in London, you were far away so it was okay.
[06:09] But now since you're in Pakistan, I'll not leave you.
[06:16] If you're insisting, its alright otherwise I don't want to go.
You'll go for me. Please.
[06:24] Okay.
[06:30] What is it brother? You've brought work from the office, home.
[06:33] Yes. There was so much work so I thought I'd bring some home. You tell me how was your day?
[06:41] My day was very nice.
Why wouldn't it be good? He was hanging out.
[06:50] I saw you with Falak. And he lied to me that he was going to the airport to pick his friend.
[07:00] I'm sorry. I thought I'd tell you later but you found out yourself.
[07:07] Had you told me that you were going to meet Falak, I would have been happy.
[07:13] Kabeer the beauty of every relationship lies in truth.
[07:20] Now, I understand that you like to spend time with Falak and its a good thing.
[07:30] But leaving important meeting and lying at the cost of all this, I think that's very unprofessional behavior.
[07:38] Alright. Please stop.
[07:40] You're lecturing my sweet, innocent younger brother.
I'm not lecturing him, I'm making him understand.
[07:46] She's right.
[07:50] Its my fault. I should have told the truth.
[07:53] Its good that you understand.
[07:57] Remember this, one wrong step in life can lead you astray.
[08:08] I understand. I have an idea.
[08:15] The conversation is very serious now. Coming back to Falak, whats the scene?
Brother, please..
[08:41] Yesterday was my sister's engagement so I couldn't come but there is nothing between us that we should worry about one another.
[08:53] Nobody can step over anyone without any reason.
[08:55] First of all they believe that you're in their feet. A person is always insulted the most by people they like.
[09:09] You valued money over love. You left me hanging to make your career. Without telling me anything.
[10:32] Nawal, can you not forget it? I accept its my mistake. I should have told you before I left.
[10:39] I apologize.
[10:45] What should I do to make you forget and forgive me? How much will you punish me for one mistake?
[11:02] Hamza, where are you? I have called you ten times since morning, your phone was off.
[11:08] Nawal listen to me.
[11:09] Where are you? Tell me. I'll come. We'll go somewhere outside.
[11:13] Nawal I want to tell you something.
[11:15] Yes tell me.
First promise me you'll hear me out. Completely.
[11:21] Hamza what is it? You're worrying me. Tell me.
[11:27] I came to London on the morning flight.
[11:34] No. You're,
[11:38] lying. You're joking.
[11:43] No. I'm not joking. I'll send you my current location.
[12:03] Nawal I knew you'd not believe me but what could I do? I had to set up my business in London.
[12:08] It was important for me to come here.
[12:12] But your business was set here already.
Yes but it isn't what I wanted like here.
[12:18] You know business is my passion. My craze.
[12:21] It wasn't growing like I wanted in Pakistan. I got the chance now Nawal. How could I let it go?
[12:30] You decided for yourself, without talking to me. Without telling me.
[12:35] I didn't realize I was so unimportant for you.
[12:40] Its not like that Nawal. I tried to tell you so many times but I couldn't gather the courage.
[12:48] I knew you'd stop me and I couldn't have faced you.
This is a lie.
[12:55] You're a selfish person. You couldn't see anything other than your happiness.
[12:58] You don't care about others.
I care about you Nawal.
[13:04] Had you cared for me, you wouldn't have left me.
[13:06] I will come back Nawal. I promise you. I love you very much.
[13:13] Please try and understand me.
Your love is a lie. Just like you.
[13:20] How could I trust someone, why should I wait for a person who valued money over love?
[13:27] You value your desires over anybody else's happiness.
Nawal.. Please.
[13:35] Trust me. Its just for a few months. Hello? Nawal?
[14:23] I will never forgive you. Never. You hurt my emotions.
[14:32] You came back after five years and you think everything will be like it was earlier. You're mistaken now.
[14:42] Nothing is like it was earlier. Nothing. I only have hatred in my heart for you. Only hatred.
[15:09] You're off today.
[15:11] I'm going to the grocery store. I wanted to get a few things. You tell me if you need anything.
[15:15] No. I don't need anything. Just that do you remember we have to go finalize Falak's wedding date today. Don't be late.
[15:23] Of course I remember. Don't worry.
[15:25] Now tell me, aunt and uncle will be here, won't they?
They said they would be. Where is Falak?
[15:32] Falak is in her room.
I'll go meet her.
[15:36] Okay.
[15:45] Falak? Falak? Oh, shopping?
[15:56] Yes. I went to the mall yesterday.
[16:01] I liked them so I bought them.
They seem very expensive.
[16:07] I think as far as I remember you didn't have money in your card.
[16:14] Yes, I didn't buy them. A friend of mine got me these.
So expensive?
[16:22] Yes. It was her birthday. She bought something for everyone so this was for me.
[16:28] Falak, I don't think you should accept such an expensive gift from your friend.
[16:33] You're always scolding me.
[16:36] I couldn't say no because she insisted so much. I couldn't break her heart. You know me.
[16:42] Alright. I was going to the market. I thought I'd ask you.
[16:46] You go ahead. Mom said we had to go to Kabeer's in the evening so I'll just get ready.
[16:51] Alright. Message me if you need anything.
[17:33] What are you doing? Pick up these sweets and get them in the car. Take this when you're back.
[17:41] Where is Falak? We're getting late.
She'll be here. You're looking fine.
[17:46] This color suits you.
She's here.
[17:50] How do I look?
Very pretty. Different. All praise to the Lord.
[17:55] May God save my daughter from all evil eyes.
[18:00] Oh. First lets discuss that.
Discuss what?
[18:11] Actually we wanted to tell Kabeer's family about you before we fix the date.
Tell what?
[18:20] That I'm a servant's daughter? Do you know what will happen then? They'll say no.
[18:26] Falak this will not happen. They're very good people.
[18:31] What does being good mean? Why would they want to bring a servant's daughter as their daughter in law?
[18:36] Mom, if you want to get me insulted, its best if you call them from home.
[18:42] They'll say the same things about a servant's daughter..
[18:44] Why are you repeating being a servant's daughter again and again?
[18:47] Your parents were not thieves that you want to hide their identity.
[18:52] This is nothing to be insulted about. You're an educated, mature girl.
[18:57] See Falak..
[18:59] If we don't tell them now and if they find out in the future, what will we do?
[19:04] We want to tell them so that it won't create any problem for you in the future.
[19:09] Mom, you won't do such a thing. You'll not say anything to anyone.
Falak.. Falak..
[19:16] See dear, those building that are built on lies in their foundation, they're not strong. Try to understand this.
[19:25] Don't worry. Mom will talk and handle everything.
[19:29] Nothing will be handled after this. But if you still want to do it, I'll tell you this. You'll be responsible for everything that happens afterwards. I'll kill myself.
[19:37] Falak.. Listen to me.
[19:41] Go and see her, Nawal.
[19:44] Mom, its important to tell them. They'll find the truth one day and then how many people will we be answerable too.
[19:50] Alright. Go and look. We're getting late. We have to pick my brother and sister in law.
[19:55] I'll go call her.
[19:58] Falak..
[20:44] All praise to the Lord, you have a big house.
Hmm.
[20:49] I love the interior of your house. You have given quite an artistic touch. Who designed it for you?
[20:58] Actually Aaliya designed it herself.
[21:02] Oh wow really. I'll have to compliment you.
[21:06] You have maintained your house so well alongside your business.
[21:11] Thank you very much.
[21:13] Kabeer, you take Nawal and Falak along and show them the house. Show them your room.
[21:18] Of course, sister in law. Please come.
[21:33] This is my room. Hopefully you people like it. How is it?
Its nice.
[21:40] Its nice. Sorry one second.
[21:45] I'll just attend this call and come.
[21:50] So when do you want to finalize the date for?
[21:53] We wanted to finalize a date for this month only.
[22:02] Falak has her exams next week and it'll take a week for her exams to end.
[22:07] Then we'll have to do a few preparations. You can have any date for the next month.
[22:15] Alright. Then we should finalize the first Friday of the next month. How does that sound?
[22:22] Its a good deed and an auspicious day.
[22:28] Alright then. Friday will be fine. Isn't it Sultana?
[22:33] I wanted to have some time for the preparations but if you people think its fine, I have no objections.
[22:42] See, we have already told you that we don't want any dowry. Anything that burdens a girl's family, we don't want it.
[22:52] We won't have anything.
[22:54] You're absolutely right Aaliya but we cannot marry off our daughters empty handed. We have to give them something.
[23:03] Sultana don't be stubborn. They're right.
[23:09] Yes. As you people say.
[23:13] See, I'm telling you.
[23:16] Please don't worry. We're bringing Falak here like the daughter of this house. Not a daughter in law.
[23:22] Thank you very much. I trust you.
[23:28] Sultana. Did you tell these people about Falak's background?
[23:35] What are you saying?
We shouldn't be hiding it. Tell them..
[23:38] Tell us what? What are you two talking about?
[23:41] Actually Aaliya, Touqeer..
Mom? Mom?
[23:45] Oh my God. Hafsa..
Hafsa dear..
[23:58] Are you alright?
[24:01] sister Aaliya set everything in this room according to her taste.
[24:07] Yes but you should have chosen a few things yourself.
[24:12] You know what? I have terrible taste.
[24:16] But still. I think Aaliya influence your life very much.
[24:21] As it is, there are very few people as obedient as you in times like today.
[24:28] After my mom and dad passed away. Sister Aaliya took care of me.
[24:34] She encouraged me.
[24:37] Even she helped me set my business and whatever I'm today, I'm because of her. That is why,
[24:46] if I'm thankful to anybody after God, that is sister Aaliya because she and my brother are just like my parents.
[24:57] This is such a good thing. But its fine as far as your business is concerned but you'd have some likes for your room.
[25:06] Had I been in your place I would have decorated my room, myself.
[25:13] You're very cute.
[25:18] Are you alright, dear?
[25:21] Is she alright?
Thnk God she's fine. You know how kids don't care about anything else.
[25:28] Kids grow up like this. They fall down. They're okay.
[25:34] You wanted to talk about something.
[25:38] Actually I wanted to tell you that.
[25:41] Actually my sister in law wants to say that..
[25:45] Falak is quite young and immature and marriage is a big responsibility.
[25:51] If she makes a mistake, please ignore it.
[25:55] I've told you a lot of times and I'll tell you again,
[25:59] Falak will come here as the daughter of this house, not a daughter in law.
[26:03] You shouldn't worry about her. She'll not face any problem in this house. Isn't it?
Exactly.
[26:10] Thank you very much.
[26:12] Alright fine. When you come here, you can set everything as you like. Alright?
[26:20] Of course, I'll do everything with my choice.
Nobody will stop you.
[26:25] Now should we go downstairs, everybody must be waiting.
Yes. Lets go.
[26:34] Please take this.
Thank you very much. We're already stuffed.
[26:39] The food is very tasty. I'm pine for such food in London.
[26:44] Sir, all credit goes to my wife. Aaliya cooks in our house.
[26:50] All praise to the Lord.
[26:53] By the way, Aaliya I'm very impressed by you.
[26:56] The way you've managed everything. Your career, your house, the interior, your family and,
[27:04] everything around the house. Very impressive.
[27:07] We have servants to do everything but the kitchen and food, I prefer to cook myself.
[27:16] When everybody works hard around the day, the food at least should be healthy and tasty.
[27:21] You're absolutely right but our Falak might face a little difficulty.
[27:33] What do you mean?
[27:34] Actually Falak is our pampered child. We have never given her any responsibility of working around the house.
[27:42] Its alright. She'll learn. I'll teach her. You'll see how Falak will be just like me in a few months. Isn't it?
[27:53] Its difficult because Falak isn't interested in all this. Falak likes to go out, eating out,
[28:00] and shopping. Isn't it Falak?
[28:13] She'll have to take interest. As they say the way to your husband's heart is through his stomach.
[28:23] Of course and as it is, Kabeer cannot digest outside food. Didn't you tell her that?
[28:30] Exactly. I spend all day in the hotel so when we come home we prefer homemade food.
[28:38] Falak will also learn gradually.
[28:41] Why not? Falak you also say something. You're not speaking at all.
[28:48] What can I say? I'm enjoying the food. You people please talk.
[29:16] By the way Nazish is coming tomorrow.
Wow. That's great. When is her flight due?
[29:21] Its around 2pm. You'll have to pick her up from the airport.
[29:24] But I have a very important meeting at 2.
[29:28] But its alright. You can go with the driver.
[29:32] Won't you ask why your sister is coming to Pakistan all of a sudden?
[29:36] She's coming to meet us. What is there to ask about?
[29:39] No. I called her here for a special mission.
[29:43] Oh. Special mission? What is that?
[29:46] Your marriage. Whenever I talk to you about it, you put me off.
[29:51] Now since she's coming, she'll ask you herself why don't you want to get married?
[29:55] You're doing this on purpose.
[29:57] Before today, you never talked about it or you were never stubborn.
[30:02] Something happened to you suddenly that you're now after my life.
[30:05] Dear, you're already late. You're so busy with your business
[30:10] that you don't realize that you have this entire chapter missing in your life.
[30:15] I feel the company you're sitting with these days is to be blamed.
[30:20] No. Not fair. You cannot blame anybody else. I'll get you married now. Whether you like it or not.
[30:28] If you like someone, tell your sister. We'll talk to her family.
[30:33] You don't need to be shy. But if there's nothing like that, then,
[30:38] I'll find a girl for you myself. You'll have to get married whether you like it or not.
[30:43] I don't care. She'll take care of you now.
[30:57] Sultana I don't understand why you're hiding this from them. It isn't a small thing.
[31:03] They'll find out one day, one way or the other.
[31:07] She's right. You have no reason to hide and you shouldn't keep them in the dark.
[31:15] They're family now and Sultana I think they should know.
Brother.. Sister in law..
[31:24] Actually Falak doesn't want them to know about this.
What?
[31:30] Falak doesn't want it and you'll listen to her and hide such a big thing. Whats wrong with you?
[31:37] See, don't take me wrong. Falak is a child. 
[31:41] She doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
[31:45] But you're sensible. You should know that its your daughter's.. I mean they're Falak's in laws.
[31:54] They'll find out about it one day, what will you do then? 
[31:56] They'll ask you questions then how will you answer them? Such things call off relationships.
[32:03] Then will you get Falak married again?
God forbid. What are you saying?
[32:11] Sultana you're mistaken.
[32:15] Sultana thinks I don't like Falak and that's why I'm saying this but this is the truth.
[32:21] Hiding such a small thing can stir up a big storm. No matter where you get her hitched, lying,
[32:31] is against the ethics.
[32:35] Sister in law, Falak doesn't want them to know so I'll not mention it to anyone.
[32:44] I cannot put my daughter in trouble and truths that foretell disaster,
[32:53] its best if they stay hidden for as long as possible. Everybody will find out when the time is right.
[33:00] Alright. Your wish. Do as you want to do.
[33:05] Who are we to say anything? Safdar lets go. We're getting late.
Sister in law..
[33:10] Sister in law. Let him eat something.
We ate at Aaliya's, now I'm full.
[33:16] But sister in law..
Don't worry. She'll be fine. Alright?
[33:39] Whats wrong with you?
I heard everything. What is uncle and aunt's problem?
[33:46] Be mindful of them. They're elder and your uncle and aunt.
[33:50] Did aunt and uncle leave? Weren't they staying the night?
[33:53] Yes, they had some work so they left. They'll come again.
Mom, I'm telling you.
[33:59] Tell uncle, especially aunt that nobody needs to interfere in our personal matters.
[34:13] What happened?
[34:16] My brother and sister in law insisted that Kabeer's family should know about Falak.
[34:23] Falak listened to everything.
We should have told them. We wanted the same thing.
[34:29] But if Falak doesn't want us to tell, what can we do?
She doesn't want Kabeer's family to know.
[34:37] She is upset because of that only.
[34:41] Go and see her. She's a very emotional girl.
I'll see.
[34:54] Falak...
[34:56] What is aunt's problem with me? God knows what she against me.
[35:01] She doesn't have any problem with you.
[35:05] You know how blunt she is since forever. She doesn't have a bad heart its just,
[35:13] her tone is bitter.
Some tones cut people deep within. They finish them.
[35:22] Alright. Let it be. I am still influenced by the lifestyle of your in laws.
[35:30] What a house. Superb. Aaliya has done such a wonderful interior. Kabeer's room. You're very lucky.
[35:38] I think this is what aunt is jealous about.
Don't say like this Falak.
[35:47] Did you note, Aaliya has complete control in the house. Everything happens with her will.
[35:56] I'm inspired by her. 
[35:58] She is handling everything. Her house, business, family, social circle. I've seen very few women like her.
[36:05] Please stop it now.
[36:07] I think she is a selfish woman. She likes to be complimented. 
[36:12] That's why she likes to do everything by her own self.
[36:15] You are always thinking negatively.
[36:17] I'm not being negative. Why should one work themselves when they have so many servants.
[36:23] Its not a good thing.
[36:24] She likes it and if a woman won't look after her house, who will?
[36:31] sister Nawal you sound totally like her. Please.
[36:35]  I've thought only Kabeer is going to be my responsibility. I'll only look after our things. It won't matter who does what in that house.
[36:45] I don't like working like servants. People only suit to the role they're assigned to.
[36:50] Falak.. You..
[36:52] I'm tired. You please leave and switch off the lights when you go.
[37:37] Touqeer, don't you think Sultana aunty is hiding something from us.
[37:45] I mean when Fariha aunty said something about Falak, did you see how Sultana aunty lost all color?
[37:56] Hmm. You're right. Even I felt something off.
[38:04] I don't know why I feel as if there is something.
[38:09] There are some people who create mysteries without any reason.
[38:14] Let it go.
Touqeer, such a thing while fixing the date.
[38:21] Maybe there is something they're hiding from us.
[38:25] Whats wrong with you? Why are you being Sherlock Holmes?
[38:29] I'm serious.
[38:31] You're the limit. She hasn't come to the house and you've built a battlefront for her.
[38:38] Tell me, what possibly can they hide from us. 
[38:42] This is what we should think about. Maybe we have a misunderstanding.
[38:46] And if you're not at peace, you should call Farheen. She'll tell you.
[38:55] You're right. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Its not important that whatever we see,
[39:02] is what we perceive it to be. Maybe its something else.
[39:05] Yes. That exactly my point. Now since you've wasted so much of my energy, go and make me black coffee.
[39:11] You're very clever. You know the servants are asleep by now and you'll get the one I make.
[39:17] You know the one you made is the best.
[39:35] Hello?
What are you doing? Where are you?
[39:39] Where else would I be? I'm working.
[39:41] Don't you get bored working all day. The weather is very good. Lets go out somewhere.
[39:48] I like working when its time to work.
[39:53] So what, take out some time. The weather is so good. Lets hang out and have lunch somewhere good.
[40:00] I'm sorry Falak. My meeting will start in a bit.
[40:04] Yes so if you have a meeting, sister Aaliya will take care of it. She always does.
[40:09] You come and pick me.
[40:12] This meeting is of my department. She doesn't know anything about it.
[40:16] So you're saying no to me?
[40:18] I'm not saying no. We'll go tomorrow.
[40:22] No. I have to go today and with you only. Take me now.
[40:26] Falak whats wrong? Why are you insisting like a child?
[40:29] I said we'll go tomorrow. Listen, its time for my meeting. I'll talk when I'm free.
[40:36] Hello? Kabeer....
[40:45] Come, sit. You must be tired. How was your flight?
[40:51] It was good, mom.
[40:55] Where is Hamza? He didn't even come to pick me.
[40:58] Dear he said he was busy. He couldn't come to the airport.
[41:03] Mom haven't you given him a free hand? Couldn't he take out time to come pick me up?
[41:11] Now look at me. I came so far away, leaving my husband and daughter behind, just for him.
[41:17] Dear don't you know your brother? He's crazy about his business.
[41:20]  Work comes first and everything else is secondary. That's why.
[41:24] This is why he's all alone mom. 
[41:27] Trust me, I had such good proposals. So many asked for him in my in laws.
[41:34] What can I do, he doesn't listen to me. Now you're here. Do something.
[41:40] Alright. Don't worry. I'm here. I'll handle everything. Don't worry. I'll take care.
[41:47] Superb. Now have something to drink.
[41:50] Please you too have something mom.
Not yet. I'll have tea later.
[41:57] Sir, these are the invoices from our food and labor suppliers. Please have a look
[42:02] Sure. I'll look. Thank you.
[42:04] Thank you sir.
