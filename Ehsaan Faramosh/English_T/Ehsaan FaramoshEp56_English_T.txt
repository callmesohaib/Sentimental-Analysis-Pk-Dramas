[01:06] Kabeer will you have tea? Should I get it made?
[01:09] No. I just had it a while ago.
[01:13] Actually I wanted to discuss something important with you.
[01:17] Tell me. Is everything alright? Is everything fine in the office?
[01:20] Yes everything's fine in the office. Actually...
[01:25] I don't want to get married again.
[01:30] Please don't talk to Nawal about it now.
[01:34] What? What are you saying?
[01:38] You know very well I took your proposal.
[01:43] Did you two talk Kabeer? Did Nawal say something?
[01:46] No. Nawal didn't say anything.
[01:51] I thought about it myself.
[01:54] I don't think I'll be comfortable with this relationship.
[01:59] That's why I don't want to get married again.
[02:04] You don't have to think about yourself but for Ilham.
[02:09] Please don't worry for Ilham.
[02:14] I'll manage somehow.
[02:17] Kabeer, if not today then tomorrow, you'll have to get married.
[02:21] Or have you decided to not marry for the rest of your life.
[02:25] Think of it, like that only. I..
[02:29] don't want to remarry again.
[02:31] What stupidity is this?
[02:36] You know you're making a big mistake rejecting a girl like Nawal.
[02:43] If I tell you that Nawal too isn't in the favor of this relationship and she doesn't want to marry me either. Then?
[02:53] This means, Nawal said no to you.
[02:58] What difference does it make? Just don't talk to anyone about it.
[03:08] Please.
[03:24] Are you upset with me because I didn't call?
[03:32] Mom you know I had so many meetings and I was very busy.
[03:37] Its the first time you didn't call me.
[03:41] Mom is right Hamza.
[03:44] You have always been busy, you had meetings too but you made time to call.
[03:57] Okay. Its my fault. I should have called you.
[04:03] This will not happen again. I promise.
[04:05] Hello auntie.
[04:09] How are you feeling now?
[04:23] She's greeting you so lovingly and inquiring about your health. Answer her at least.
[04:28] I have a splitting headache. I'm going to sleep.
[04:33] Nazish, you come to me.
Yes, mom.
[05:07] What happened Hamza?
[05:10] No matter what I do, mom is still upset.
[05:15] I feel helpless.
[05:19] Its alright Hamza, she'll be fine. It'll take some time but she'll get normal with you. She's your mother
[05:28] I hope so.
[05:31] I'm always with you. Don't worry, everything will be alright.
[05:37] Now come and get a little rest. You're already tired.
[05:50] Hello Nawal.
Aaliya, you're at office today. Please sit.
[05:55] Yes I was a little free, I thought I'd drop by the office today and get an update.
[06:00] You tell me, how are you?
I'm absolutely fine. You tell me.
[06:06] Actually I came here to invite you for dinner.
[06:10] I'm hosting it. Toqueer had a good deal finalized in Germany.
[06:16] To celebrate it. I'd love if you'd join us.
[06:20] Congratulations to you first. But actually,
[06:26] my aunt is here so it might be a bit of a problem for me.
[06:32] Nawal, it'll just be the three of us. Kabeer, I and Ilham.
[06:38] If you join us, I'll be happy. I'll like it.
[06:42] And Ilham, she cheers up when she sees you. Please come.
[06:49] That's fine but..
Not ifs or buts.
[06:52] You're having dinner with us tonight.
[06:58] Alright, if you insist. I'll come for a while.
[07:03] Thank you and see you then.
[07:06] Okay?
Definitely.
[07:07] Okay. Please sit. Bye.
[07:20] Why did you have to invite Nawal for dinner?
[07:25] What are you saying?
[07:27] If you and Nawal aren't getting married, this doesn't mean we cannot have dinner.
[07:36] And Ilham is attached to Nawal.
[07:39] She is happy with her and I thought if we go together, she'll be happy.
[07:45] But Nawal,
[07:47] isn't Ilham's babysitter.
[07:49] We don't have a nanny yet and we don't know when we'll have one for sure.
[07:55] I'll leave too and you'll be all alone.
[07:57] If you're in need, at least Nawal will be able to come. Ilham will be fine.
[08:07] Why are you overreacting so much? Nawal used to come.
[08:12] What difference would it make if she comes now?
[08:15] Its not that.
[08:18] Actually, to be very honest, I don't want Ilham to be attached to Nawal.
[08:26] Think about it yourself.
[08:27] If Nawal doesn't have time in the future and if she cannot come to meet Ilham, I'll have a lot of trouble.
[08:36] Kabeer, I've already invited her.
[08:41] I cannot do anything.
[08:44] We'll meet in the evening.
Okay.
[09:49] Falak, look, is that Nawal and Kabeer?
[10:01] I think its them. They look so happy together.
[10:12] I'll destroy their happiness right away.
[10:14] Falak, they're sitting. Listen to me.
[10:17] Why do you have to create a scene?
[10:20] Even if they're happy together, what difference does it make to you?
[10:22] It does! She created a scene on my reception. I'll settle the score.
[10:27] Falak...
[10:42] You?
[10:45] What are you doing here?
[10:47] You must be enjoying a lot.
[10:52] This is my sister. Step sister, who turned my husband against me, got me divorced and trapped him.
[11:02] You have lost your mind. What nonsense is this?
[11:05] This is nonsense? I'm telling the truth.
[11:12] Do you find it bitter? Tell me, don't you two have an affair?
[11:16] Even you don't then whats she doing with you?
[11:25] There must be something going on.
[11:28] Enough!
[11:31] I'm warning you. Don't say another word.
[11:36] I've given you enough leverage. I know your real face well.
[11:41] You'll not become truthful creating a scene in front of all these people. Leave from here, this instant.
[11:47] And meet him, he's my ex-husband.
[11:54] Who did everything with my sister.
[11:57] He sided with her to threw me out of his life and divorce me.
[12:06] I will show your real face to the world. I'll show them how you deceived me and wronged me.
[12:20] You had an affair underneath my nose.
[12:23] Now clarify to people and tell them you don't have anything going on.
[12:38] Why are you creating a scene here? What will you get?
[12:44] I'll expose these two. I'll take over their facade of innocence.
[12:49] They're liars, they're cheats. They deceived me and destroyed my life.
[12:54] Falak, whats wrong with you?
[12:59] Falak, for God's sake, stop this and leave.
[13:03] What did you think? Only you have the right to destroy people's life and create scenes?
[13:09] I did the same like you did that day. I did the same. Score's even now.
[13:20] I'll shout and tell everyone what you did to me!
[13:23] How you destroyed my life? Then you can clarify to people how respected you are.
[13:29] I'll tell people how she destroyed her own sister's house.
[13:40] Look at the child, this is my daughter.
[13:43] She is more attached to her than me. It seems she's her daughter.
[13:49] They snatched my daughter from me.
[13:56] Mr. Kabeer, is there a problem?
[13:59] We don't know who she is? She's speaking nonsense. Please throw her out. She's mad
[14:05] Yes I'm mad and you've made me mad. Both of you.
[14:09] Please mam will you leave or shall I call the security?
[14:13] We're going.
[14:15] I'll show their real faces to the world. I'll tell everyone.
[14:25] Thank you.
[14:56] Nawal, stop crying.
[15:02] I don't believe that Falak made a joke out of my existence in front of everyone.
[15:08] She dragged me through the mud.
[15:11] What did she say..
[15:15] I was so ashamed. What would those people think about me? Am I like this?
[15:22] I destroyed my sister's house?
[15:26] She's an ungrateful woman. She doesn't care about any relationship.
[15:31] And you? Why are you worried thinking about her?
[15:34] Don't you know her instincts?
[15:36] I'm worried thinking why didn't nobody stop her? Kabeer or Aaliya?
[15:41] She took divorce herself and blamed you for everything?
[15:45] And then she married Hamza and turned him against you.
[15:50] She stole and now she's grieving as well.
[15:54] If I had been there, I would have broken her face.
[15:57] She's lying shamelessly. She said I have an affair with Kabeer.
[16:06] I wanted the ground to open and myself to be buried in it. Alive. I want to die.
[16:11] God forbid that you die. Falak is the one who should be dead.
[16:18] I'm just scared of one thing.
[16:20] The thing that Hamza said, now the entire world will know it.
[16:26] I cannot show my face to the world.
[16:30] How will I face people? How will I clarify my character, aunt?
[16:37] Nawal you don't have to clarify a lie.
[16:42] You don't have to think about it. Forget the nonsense Falak said.
[16:48] If the entire world is lying, its deemed as the truth.
[16:54] Alright my dear, stop crying. You'll make yourself sick if you cry like this. Come, sit here.
[17:02] Sit here. Sit my dear. Please stop.
[17:08] God will punish Falak. She's made you cry so much.
[17:24] Do you even realize how I felt when I saw the two together?
[17:27] I wanted to burn them alive. They're shameless people.
[17:31] When mom was alive, she would stop her. But now nobody is there and they roam around like shameless people.
[17:36] Had my friend not stopped her, I would have done something.
[17:46] Hamza are you listening to me?
Yes I'm listening.
[17:49] Then why doesn't it make a difference to you. Why are you sitting peacefully and working?
[17:55] Because I have no relation with Nawal, it doesn't make a difference to me. I hate her.
[18:01] Why do you mention her again and again to me?
[18:07] Then go.
[18:08] Go and tell aunty and Nazish. They always praise her innocence and insult me.
[18:14] They should know what their innocent Nawal is up to.
[18:25] What will happen then?
[18:27] At least they'll stop taunting me everyday. All this is happening because of Nawal.
[18:33] They'll know that the one they kept calling a liar wasn't a liar.
[18:37] They have an affair in real. Now look. If they don't believe me, its alright.
[18:42] Everything will come to the forefront sooner or later. Things cannot stay hidden forever. Then I'll ask them.
[18:49] They said I'm a liar in front of the whole world.
[18:52] Enough! I'm trying to do an important work and you've eaten my brain.
[18:57] Let me work in peace.
[19:01] Fine.
[19:30] Whatever happened is very bad.
[19:33] The scene Falak created, it left us not able to show face anywhere.
[19:39] I told you not to invite Nawal.
[19:44] Had Nawal not been there, Falak wouldn't have dared create a scene.
[19:49] What are you saying? You know very well, you, me and Ilham are like a family for Nawal.
[19:55] How would I have known Falak would come there?
[19:59] I'm so worried thinking what will Nawal have to hear after such a big spectacle. What will she have to face?
[20:07] Everybody will be talking about it. You're a boy, it won't make a difference to you, but she's a girl. She'll be affected.
[20:13] How can it make no difference?
[20:15] The cheap allegations she hurled, it does make a difference to me.
[20:20] She said so much nonsense. She did it before.
[20:24] But it wasn't in front of everyone. No matter how small the accusation is,
[20:30] when things spread in public, people talk.
[20:34] I'm scared how much Nawal will have to hear.
[20:39] And because of us she will be facing a lot of difficulties.
[20:44] What are you talking about?
[20:48] Who will marry Nawal after all this?
[20:51] Whats wrong with you? How are you connecting these two things?
[20:56] Where did Nawal's wedding come in from?
[21:00] Who will tell the boy's family all these false accusations?
[21:03] Because a boy's family is the first to hear about all false allegations about a girl.
[21:09] No matter if they are lies, nobody investigates.
[21:14] Nobody has so much time. Everybody believes what they hear.
[21:33] This is my sister, step sister, who instigated my husband against me and got me divorced. She entraped him.
[21:48] I'm telling the truth. Do you find it bitter?
[21:52] Don't you have an affair? If you don't then why is she hear with you?
[21:56] There is something after all between you two.
[22:08] What did you think? Only you had the right to destroy people's life?
[22:14] I told you today. The way you insulted us that day. I did too today. Score settled.
[22:28] Meet him, he's my ex husband.
[22:31] He did all this with my sister. He threw me out of his life and divorced me.
[22:56] I'll expose the two of them.
[22:58] This facade of innocence that they have. They deceived me and destroyed my life.
[23:23] I called Kabeer and he told me you didn't come to the office so I came here. I was worried.
[23:34] Are you okay Nawal?
Aaliya I couldn't sleep all night.
[23:42] I feel very helpless.
[23:48] It feels as if someone has kept me on fire.
[23:53] Whatever Falak said.
[23:57] You know Falak. She's like that.
[24:03] She couldn't bear to see you with us. That's it.
[24:07] If I meet you or Ilham, I'm not getting anything out of it.
[24:14] I take care of her because she's Falak's daughter.
[24:18] Mom made me promise to take care of Ilham before she left me.
[24:27] I never knew Falak held so much poison in her heart for me.
[24:35] See, the scene she created was to satisfy her ego.
[24:40] She wants to turn you against us. 
[24:46] Had she cared for her daughter, would she have left her like an orphan.
[24:54] She is a mother who doesn't even bother about her daughter. 
[25:03] She didn't even ask about her once.
[25:07]  Is this how mothers are?
[25:10] You were there to take care of Ilham and now she wants to take you away from Ilham.
[25:19] So, will you leave Ilham because of Falak?
[25:25] Of course not. I cannot stay away from Ilham. My life is with her.
[25:33] Nawal let me say something. The best for you and Kabeer is to get married.
[25:49] Aaliya, I.. I cannot marry Kabeer. 
[25:57] If I marry Kabeer, everything she said would be proven true. People would think,
[26:04] we had an affair. But it never was.
[26:08] Even Kabeer doesn't want to get married again. 
[26:12] The way everything has come to, once you're married, these rumors will die their own death.
[26:20] I know its a tough decision but its for the better. 
[26:26] I told you earlier as well. If not for yourself,
[26:32] think for Ilham. She's very attached to you.
[27:39] Hamza, I want to talk to you.
[27:41] What nonsense is this Falak? I was talking to a very important client.
[27:47] You're worried about your client and what about the fire inside me?!
[27:51] But what happened? Tell me.
[27:52] I found these things from Nawal in your cupboard. What does this mean?
[27:56]  You say you hate her but why do you have these things?
[28:02] I told you, don't interfere in my personal things.
[28:06]  Let things stay where they are. Whats your problem?
[28:10] Whats the problem with me? Tell me whats in your heart? 
[28:14] Do you still love her... 
[28:16] Tell me, if you're upset about breaking up with Nawal..
[28:22] You have lost your mind. What are you saying?
[28:25] So what should I say? 
[28:26] You tell me you hate her and yet you have kept her gifts safe. What should I understand?
[28:35] You think I'm a fool. 
[28:38] Tell me Hamza, if you want to be with Nawal, its not late. You can leave me.
[28:52] Whatever you're thinking Falak, its not like that. 
[28:57] Why do you say such things?
[28:59] Let it be Hamza. You've hurt me very much.
[29:03] Falak, listen to me.
[29:19] She created this scene to satisfy her own ego and to drive you away from us.
[29:27] If she cared for her daughter, she wouldn't have left her like an orphan. 
[29:32] Would you stop meeting Ilham because of Falak?
[29:46] Kabeer doesn't want to get married too but we're helpless now. 
[29:50] Once you're married, these rumors will die their own death.
[30:17] What is it Nawal? You didn't come out of your room all day.
[30:21] I had a headache. I thought I'd feel better if I rested a bit.
[30:33] Should I say something if you don't mind?
[30:37]  You should listen to Aaliya. She wants to take you to her house with a lot of respect.
[30:44] The scene Falak created in the hotel, I think its for the best of you now.
[30:51] I don't understand anything, aunt. It seems my mind if shutting off.
[31:01] I have talked to your uncle as well. Even he thinks Kabeer is a good guy. 
[31:06] We can see that. Falak didn't care for Kabeer.
[31:14] Otherwise he isn't a bad guy.
[31:16] But what about the fingers people point at me?
[31:21] Don't worry about people. People talk.
[31:27]  I'll go back in some time.
[31:31] Had Sultana been here, I wouldn't worry for you. 
[31:34] but... I don't want to leave you alone. I'll be worried.
[31:42] And think about Ilham.
[31:46]  Kabeer will get married to someone and if his second wife hurts Ilham, 
[31:53] you'll be hurt as well.
[31:57] Nawal if you think of me and Safdar as your elders 
[32:02] and if you hold us in regard to decide for you, 
[32:10] we have no objections on your wedding. We will be happy if you settle down.
[32:34] Falak?
Hamza please. I don't want to talk to you.
[32:39] Falak its not like you think?
[32:42] So what should I think? 
[32:45] I told you everything that happened in the hotel that day.
[32:48] You're hurting for a woman who cheated you, deceived you. You're keeping everything safe from her. Why Hamza?
[33:14] Take these and burn them. 
[33:18] Is it okay now? 
[33:20] But Falak you'll have to promise me one thing.
[33:24] After today, you'll not mention Nawal to me. I hate her.
[33:29] So tell me what should I do? Have you seen how aunty treats me?
[33:33] No matter how much I try that she fixes her attitude with me, she always rejects me.
[33:40] and all of this is happening because of sister Nawal
[33:44] Everything is attached to her. My own sister destroyed my life.
[33:51] And if I see anything attached to her, it hurts me very much.
[34:00] I feel bad Hamza. I think that you love her even today.
[34:06] Its not like that Falak.
[34:11] Please stop crying. 
[34:16] I've thrown everything away. Please be okay now.
[34:27] Wait, let me take this call. Hello?
[34:36] When I had already told you not to, why did you mention it to her again? 
[34:43] I had promised Nawal that you won't mention marriage to her again.
[34:47] I wouldn't have talked but after the incident I was helpless.
[34:57] People are talking Kabeer. 
[35:00] If not yourself, think about Nawal. People are linking her with you.
[35:08] They're pointing fingers at her. 
[35:10] How many people she'll answer or how she'll face everyone? 
[35:15] I know nor you, neither Nawal want to marry but tell me..
[35:25] Ilham needs a mother. 
[35:29] You'll never be able to fulfill that need and I feel this is the right time to get married.
[35:38] Ilham is young. She doesn't know her mother. 
[35:43] She'll accept Nawal as her mother. 
[35:47] If she grows up, it'll create a problem for you, Kabeer.
[35:54] But Aaliya..
[35:55] Before you say no, think about it. After whatever happened, would anyone marry Nawal?
[36:10] She will spend her life alone because of you.
[36:18] God forbid, if she does something with herself, you'll be responsible for it.
[36:24] Even if I agree for it, Nawal won't because she doesn't want to marry me.
[36:33] Nawal has no objections.
[36:42] Her aunt called me. 
[36:45] Nawal has said yes to the proposal.
[36:56] Now its up to you to decide.
[36:59]  You tell me.
[37:05] Please listen to me. Its for the best for you two.
[37:25] Alright. Do whatever you think is fine.
[38:01] Make Ilham like you..
[38:17] I miss mom very much..
[38:23] My dear..
[38:30] Parents don't leave you alone even if they leave this world. 
[38:36] They're always with you.
[38:40] As prayers.. 
[38:45] Sultana's prayers are with you. May God give you a beautiful future.
[38:51] She'll be happy to see you happy.
