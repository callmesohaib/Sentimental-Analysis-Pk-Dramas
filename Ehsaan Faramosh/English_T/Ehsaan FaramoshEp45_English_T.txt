[00:13] today you have broken our relation
[00:18] I, Kabir Salahuddin... in my complete senses
[00:26] Kabir! 
[00:28] divorce you...
[00:32] I want to expose Kabir in front of the entire world 
[00:35] he is such a renown businessman
[00:38] and his actions are way too worse than an animal
[00:42] what will happen by doing this? 
[00:44] the evil will keep on spreading until we don't drag it to his end result
[00:49] Falak didn't think for a moment... 
[00:53] that what relation I & Kabir have. 
[00:56] She had put such a bad allegation
[01:00] Kabir is like a small kid of this family
[01:03]  He is precious to me like my own brother
[01:23] Kabir, do you know what is the most beautiful thing about life?
[01:27] to get a companion who loves you a lot
[01:32] So it means that I am very fortunate, because you came into my life
[01:38] true that!
[01:40] Promise me, no matter whatever happens. You will never separate me from you
[01:47] how can anyone separate itself from its soul?
[01:51] you are that part of my soul, that if I will try to separate it then I will die
[01:56] what are you saying, may your enemies die
[02:31] Falak
[02:33] why aren't you coming for the breakfast?
[02:36] I don't feel like doing it, mom
[02:40] you are upset because of Nawal's words, right?
[02:44] its her habit, don't take it to your heart
[02:47] how shall I not take it to my heart?
[02:49] She should also take care a bit, she says whatever she wants to
[02:53] I am also a human, not a stone. I also feel hurt
[02:57] Okay, why are you angry with the breakfast. Come & at least have breakfast
[03:04] I am not hungry right now
[03:07] I will eat whenever I feel like
[03:14] Okay listen to me
[03:16] do the breakfast whenever you feel like, but do it for sure
[03:32] sister Nawal.. .
[03:35] where are you going?
[03:37] office... 
[03:38] how can you be so insensitive?
[03:40] You are talking about going to Kabir's office, knowing the fact that he has left me already
[03:45] Falak, you know I have invested billions in it. I cannot leave it like that
[03:49] Alright then, take out your investment
[03:54] what's the harm in it? The way they have snatched the shelter from my head
[03:58] the same way, you should also snatch the ground beneath their feet. You are my sister
[04:01] at least you can do this much for me
[04:03] Falak, I cannot do this right now
[04:06] for now the share price is way too low. And I am not such a fool to do such a major loss 
[04:12] and what about the loss I had suffered? Who will take its revenge?
[04:16] what not Kabir did with me? He did a lot of injustice to me
[04:19] Falak, I will give the resignation as soon as I will get another job. But right now I am helpless
[04:24] what is your compulsion? There isn't any compulsion, I Know
[04:28] You just want to hurt me
[04:30] Falak, listen to me...
I don't want to hear anything... 
[04:47] mom
[04:48] yes
[04:48] I wanted to talk to you about something important
[04:51] yes, tell me
[04:52] I wanted to do it earlier as well, but then I thought that you'll be worried that's why I didn't discussed it
[04:56] what's the matter Falak, say it
[04:58] sister Nawal has sold the SITE area plot
[05:02] what!
[05:05] she had sold the plot
[05:07] but when? I am not aware of anything
[05:09] even I don't know
[05:12] I only know that to whom the amount has been given after selling the plot
[05:16] to whom?
[05:19] to Kabir
[05:22] Kabir?
[05:24] Falak, if this is a joke then its quite a bad one
[05:29] its not a joke mom, its reality
[05:33] who told you?
[05:35] has Nawal told you?
[05:37] No, why will she tell me? 
I overheard her conversation on the call with Kabir
[05:44] that's why nowadays, she is doing a job in his company 
[05:48] I wasn't expecting this stupidity from Nawal
[05:55] Call her
[05:56] call her home right away
[05:58] I am not making any call or so, as it is nowadays she is having a misunderstanding with me 
[06:02] call her yourself
[06:07] Okay
[06:21] Nawal, where are you?
[06:23] come home right away!
[06:51] Greetings mom! What's the matter, why you have called me home in such an emergency? Is everything fine?
[06:56] have you sold that plot?
[07:04] yes, sorry I wanted to tell you but I couldn't tell you do to the unfavorable circumstances
[07:10] that plot which was our lifetime's savings or only asset, you have sold it?
[07:16] and you didn't even find it appropriate to discuss it with me
[07:22] mom, I am feeling so guilty. 
[07:25] I did wrong, I should have told you. If I would have told you then you wouldn't have stopped me
[07:28] but as I said, the circumstances were as such
[07:33] what as such the problem was Nawal that you had to sell that plot secretly?
[07:38] mom, why are you talking to me like this? 
I did all this upon Falak's request
[07:46] She had said to me that Kabir's business is drowning, her situation is getting worse day by day
[07:52] that's why I had invested the amount upon her insistence, otherwise I mean... 
[07:57] and if you don't believe me then you can ask her, she is standing here. Tell mom
[08:01] I don't know anything, how would I know?
[08:08] sister, why are you lying?
[08:10] why will I ask her to sell the plot & invest in Kabir's business?
[08:15] Falak!
[08:16] What? What are you looking at?
[08:19] I won't tell a lie to mom upon your say so
[08:23] You have invested the money in Kabir's company after selling that plot, right?
[08:27] mom, believe me I have sold that plot upon Falak's say so. I don't know why she is denying right now but... 
[08:34] whatever you'll say, I am ready to do
[08:37] everyone thinks I am the only one wrong here. Everyone thinks of me as a sacrificial goat
[08:42] everyone blames me for everything!
[08:44] Kabir & sister Aliya says that I did their character assassination, I had put a false allegation on them. And now she.. 
[08:49] being my sister she is saying that I had asked her to invest in Kabir's business. Everyone blames me, mom
[08:55] its just me who is the bad one here
[09:02] Mom, believe me I am telling the truth & Falak is lying
[09:12] I don't understand Nawal
[09:15] where was lacking in my upbringing?
[09:18] can't you see the right & wrong?
[09:20] Kabir is that guy who has spilled the poison in your sister's life
[09:25] and you have invested the money in his company
[09:29] what kind of selfishness is this?
[09:34] I am feeling ashamed while calling you my daughter
[09:38] Falak is right
[09:40] You like to hurt Falak
[09:46] why would I do that? Listen to me at least
[09:57] why you had lied in front of mom?
[09:59] when I had lied?
[10:01] I have just told her the reality
[10:03] You know it very well that I did everything upon your request
[10:10] you did upon my request? So now I am asking you to take out your investment
[10:15] the way Kabir has ruined my life, I want his life to be ruined too
[10:20] the torment he gave me, I want to gave him the same torment
[10:26] come with me & tell the entire truth to mom, come on
[10:28] I am not going anywhere!
[10:32] do what I want
[10:34] then I will do whatever you want me to do
[10:39] and if you cannot do any such thing
[10:42] then go away from here
[10:44] unbelievable!
[10:58] think once again
[11:00] what if someone else have an objection on this decision of yous
[11:05] don't you worry, nobody will have an objection
[11:10] Nawal & Falak are equal share holders
[11:14] both of them are my daughters. So eventually both of them have equal share in my house & properties
[11:19] don't worry, just make the documents
[11:22] alright then, as you wish
[11:24] So, let me get the documentation done
[11:27] thank you so much!
thank you!
[11:29] farewell*
[11:32] thank you everyone for coming here
[11:36] the motive of today's press conference is to expose the renown businessman
[11:45] the way he used to torture his wife
[11:49] the way he used to do injustice with her, being cruel to her. How he treats her like an illiterate person
[11:54] this press conference is arranged to expose him
[11:58] what!
[11:59] what did you say?
[12:06] I want to tell you all
[12:09] that Kabir had treated me like an illiterate person
[12:12] He used to misbehave with me on every other matter. His aggression, his anger, I have tolerated all
[12:18] He had put so many disgusting allegations on me. It was his regular routine to do all this
[12:24] Falak? She must be in her room
[12:27] what!
[12:30] what are you saying?
[12:33] switch on the TV
[12:36] I will call you back
[12:37] my name is Falak
[12:39] and I am the wife of a renown businessman, 
[12:43] the owner of the food chain which is not only famous in this city but in a lot of other countries too
[12:48] Its Falak... 
[12:48] how he used to treat his wife like an illiterate person. How they did injustices & cruelties with me
[12:55] today I am raising my voice to expose all those people
[13:00] who does all this
[13:02] Kabir Salahuddin, who is the owner of a very big food chain
[13:07] just a few days ago he has divorced me
[13:10] just because I had threatened him that I will expose them
[13:15] I will bring his injustices & cruelties in front of the entire world
[13:18] that's why I was given a divorce
[13:20] he used to do physical abuse too
[13:23] and I kept tolerating it, that maybe one day my love will change him
[13:28] but I became unsuccessful
[13:30] my life was made a hell, I was imprisoned in that house
[13:34] and when I had raised my voice for my right, I was ousted from my house by giving a divorce
[13:39] what kind of rule is this? I want justice
[13:42] I wanted to show their real face to all of you
[13:48] enough is enough!
[13:50] sister, a lot of bad & disgusting allegations on me!
[13:54] I am going there, I won't tolerate it anymore
[13:57] Kabir, no Kabir... you will not go anywhere right now
[14:01] your smallest reaction will become a proof for her press conference
[14:06] everyone will think that she is telling the truth
[14:08] sister, what shall I do? Tell me, what shall I do then?
[14:11] Shall I sit quietly & tolerate her rubbish?
[14:16] We will take the lawful way. Let me speak to my lawyer first, then we'll take some action
[14:23] sister, I... 
Kabir!
[14:27] Kabir, listen to me
[14:29] sister, what shall I listen to?
[14:31] what do you want? 
[14:32] That she shall keep on putting false & disgusting allegations on me, and I shall not even answer?
[14:36] We will answer! We will answer her for sure
[14:39] but right now, if you'll go to the press club can ruin the matter more. It can exaggerate the situation as well
[14:44] try to understand my point
[14:47] sister, don't worry. I just want to know that on whose orders she is doing all this?
[14:52] you will not go anywhere right now. We'll get to know that upon whose orders she is doing all this
[14:59] has she gone mad!
[15:01] She had gone there, without seeking anyone's permission or suggestion
[15:06] this girl has crossed all the limits
[15:08] did she tell you anything or so?
[15:10] wouldn't I have stopped her, if she would have told me anything?
[15:13] call her
[15:14] Call her and ask her to come back home right away!
[15:24] hello!
[15:26] Yes! Quickly tell me who is behind all this?
[15:31] because an alone girl cannot do this
[15:35] there is someone who is supporting her
[15:40] tell me quickly, I am waiting
[15:50] she isn't receiving the call?
[15:52] No
[15:54] how many times I have told you to make her understand
[15:58] She is becoming way too much obstinate
[16:00] But No! you didn't listen to me at all and she is doing such a big mistake
[16:05] mom, what happen? Are you fine?
[16:10] I am feeling a bit dizzy
[16:12] Okay come, lets go to your room. Let me call the doctor
[16:15] No, I don't need a doctor. Its Ok
[16:17] Okay come to your room, then we'll see
come
[16:20] what this girl did, Nawal?
Come with me
[16:23] Come on... come with me
Oh God!
[16:33] hello!
[16:36] what!
[16:39] what happen?
[16:42] Thank you!
[16:44] the same thing happened that I had doubt about
[16:47] Hamza is behind all this
[16:50] He is the one who is supporting Falak, and getting all this done
[16:54] what?
[16:56] who told you this?
[16:58] I have a friend who works at press club
[17:00] I had asked him to check & tell me, so just now he had called to inform
[17:03] Sister, my blood is boiling. I feel like shooting Hamza right away
[17:08] please control your anger
[17:10] don't so any stupidity right now, Kabir
[17:13] We have to handle this matter very carefully
[17:17] otherwise, we'll incur a very huge loss
[17:21] try to understand my point
[17:37] Falak, what is this madness?
[17:40] Hamza? You were with Hamza?
[17:42] you took her to the press conference?
[17:44] Yes, I took her along. Why, what happened?
[17:48] at least, I wasn't expecting this crazy behavior from you
[17:51] I know Falak is innocent, she doesn't know the consequences of such things. But you know everything
[17:57] what were you thinking when you took her there?
[18:00] that she will tell her false stories over there & people will be impressed from her? She will get sympathy?
[18:05] are you calling me a liar?
[18:07] Why I shouldn't call you a liar?
[18:09] You are after that innocent man
[18:11] although you have ruined your marriage yourself
[18:14] neither you had misbehaved with Aliya & Kabir, nor Kabir would have divorced you
[18:17] So, what is your problem?
[18:19] somebody had to expose Kabir
[18:22] people should know the person who looks so naive & well-educated guy from outside. How disgusting he is from within
[18:29] and there is no need to say anything to Falak
[18:31] whatever she did is absolutely correct
[18:34] I am feeling so disappointed right now. All of this is just a stupidity
[18:40] to raise your voice for your right is not a stupidity but bravery
[18:45] but I think that you are feeling disappointed because Kabir's reality came in front of all
[18:49] No Falak, I am hurt on the fact that the matter which was only known to us until yesterday. Today the entire city knows it
[18:57] Falak, a girls honor is quite delicate
[19:00] We don't put banners in the entire city or at every signal
[19:03] but maybe you cannot understand these points right now
[19:06] and what about those injustices & cruelties that Kabir did with me?
[19:08] Stop it Falak, stop it!
[19:10] what mountains of injustices & cruelties have been done on you that you need to do the press conferences?
[19:20] Hamza, all of this is happening because of you. You shouldn't have taken her along
[19:23] yes, I had asked Falak
[19:25] because I care for her
[19:27] I want Kabir to be punished for his actions
[19:29] he shall reach to his end result
[19:31] and what kind of a sister you are? You don't care about your sister at all?
[19:35] if you cannot apply an ointment on her wounds, then at least don't add salt to her wounds by taunting her
[19:43] and Falak, you don't need to listen to anyone's scoldings at all
[19:46] because you have done nothing wrong
[20:02] Hamza...
[20:05] why are you provoking her? What will happen by doing all this?
[20:09] a person will be punished for his actions
[20:23] with whose permission you had gone?
[20:25] do you have any idea that how much we have been defamed because of your act?
[20:29] what kind of questions people are raising in the entire society?
[20:32] what as such sin I have committed that people are scolding me like this?
[20:36] I don't need anyone's permission to raise my voice for myself
[20:41] You have bend down my head with shame
[20:45] I didn't had an idea that you have become so shameless
[20:48] neither you care about your honor, nor you care about anyone else's honor
[20:51] So tell me, what I would have done?
[20:52] nobody was believing me, so I had to take this step in compulsion
[20:56] so that people can believe me that I am not a liar!
[20:59] a daughter's honor is quite delicate
[21:03] one needs to be very careful at all times
[21:05] I had told you millions of times, not to do any such thing which will create a problem for you as well as for me
[21:11] but No! you didn't listen to me. Now tell me, to whom shall I answer?
[21:15] to people, to relatives, to society... and who else?
[21:18] Stop it! There is no need to answer anyone
[21:20] and when it will come to answering people, then now Falak can answer everyone
[21:43] Falak, talk with manners
[21:45] don't teach me manners, she needs to learn the manners
[21:49] why does she come over here to add salt to my wounds?
[21:52] Until today, I have never heard any good word from her mouth for me
[22:09] that Kabir had treated me like an illiterate person
[22:12] He used to misbehave with me on every other matter. His aggression, his anger, I have tolerated all
[22:18] He had put so many disgusting allegations on me. It was his regular routine to do all this
[22:26] Kabir Salahuddin, just a few days ago he has divorced me
[22:30] just because I had threatened him that I will expose them
[22:34] I will bring his injustices & cruelties in front of the entire world
[22:38] he used to do physical abuse too
[22:42] my life was made a hell, I was imprisoned in that house
[22:47] and when I had raised my voice for my right, I was ousted from my house by giving a divorce
[22:51] I want justice
I wanted to show their real face to all of you
[23:18] Kabir you?
[23:36] won't you ask why I came?
[23:38] obviously! you must be having some work that's why you came
[23:42] tell me
[23:43] I got to know that you are behind all this
[23:47] when I saw Falak doing the press conference
[23:51] I became worried that how come Falak got so much of courage
[23:58] I would have understood at that time that nobody else can be there in this disgusting conspiracy except for you
[24:08] you used to call me a disgusting person
[24:10] what are you, yourself?
[24:13] I had never thought that you'll stoop so low in order to defeat me
[24:17] enough Kabir!
[24:19] yes
[24:21] I remember...
[24:23] I don't drag the women of our house in business related matters
[24:27] who had said this?
[24:29] if my memory is not weak, then I think you must have said it
[24:34] I am feeling pity on you
[24:37] I came to see that a renown businessman of this city, Hamza Hashim
[24:44] whether he hadn't died by drowning in a small pond of water
[24:46] stop your rubbish!
[24:50] You are standing in my house, yet talking non-sense to me!
[24:53] is it hurting?
[24:55] in order to defame me, you are using Falak against me as a pawn 
[25:01] where Hamza Hashim's integrity & ego has gone?
[25:06] you must have ruined it
[25:09] because it was capable of it
[25:12] Kabir
[25:14] go away from here right away
[25:19] otherwise, it will be too bad for you
[25:20] this disgusting move of yours to defame me 
[25:25] will not benefit you at all
[25:28] if I want, I can file a case against you two for doing false propaganda against me
[25:39] Hamza
[25:40] consider this as my last warning
[25:44] I won't warn you next time
[26:08] send that press conference video to that medicine company
[26:12] Right away!
[26:17] I will see, how they are going to work with you
[26:20] I will never let you win
[26:41] Hello Maria, how are you?
[26:43] Falak, you have done such an amazing press conference
[26:47] you should be appreciated for it
[26:49] by the way, shall I say something?
[26:51]  You have taken the decision of getting separated from Kabir on the very right time
[26:54] finally Kabir namely obstacle has been removed from your life
[26:57] now you shall focus on your career
[27:00] even I had thought the same for myself
[27:02] but you are my very good friend, thank you!
[27:05] by the way Falak, whose idea was to do the press conference?
[27:10] Why? What happen?
[27:13] it was such an amazing idea
[27:15] this way, your career will get so much of boost that you have no idea
[27:19] just think that you've become a star overnight
[27:22] the one who is more controversial in the media field, the more that person gets famous
[27:27] do you know, a few producers have contacted us to take dates from you
[27:37] No Maria, not for now. Right now I am in iddat (waiting period after divorce)
[27:42] I won't be able to come even if I want to
[27:45] As it is, I have decided that for now I will not sign any new project
[27:49] why?
[27:53] because I need some time to come out of this phase
[27:57] You can see Falak, this is the right time. You can encash this popularity though
[28:04] as I said, not right now
[28:07] Falak, what's with you? Be professional
[28:11] this way, you'll ruin your career
[28:15] why don't you do one thing? Come to my office then we'll sit & discuss it
[28:20] hmm... I will visit someday. Bye!
[28:44] I saw Falak's press conference
[28:47] I couldn't believe that its Falak
[28:50] when did she got a divorce?
[28:52] a few weeks ago
[28:55] but she was saying that Kabir is such a nice guy, he takes very good care of her
[29:00] So how come this had happened all of a sudden?
[29:01] didn't both of you stopped her, for not doing the press conference like this?
[29:05] the girls of our family never do such things
[29:08] And Sultana, you had a firm belief on her that she listens to you for everything
[29:13] So, didn't you stop her for not doing all this?
[29:15] aunty, Mom & I weren't aware of it
[29:19] even if you guys had known still she wouldn't have stopped. I know her this much
[29:23] that girl is quite an obstinate one
[29:25] I had told you earlier, this girl will never stay happily married
[29:29] Wow aunty! then you must be very happy to hear that I got a divorce
[29:35] because your words are proved to be true, right?
[29:40] Falak, talk with manners
[29:42] don't teach me manners, she needs to learn the manners
[29:46] why does she come over here to add salt to my wounds?
[29:49] Until today, I have never heard any good word from her mouth for me
[29:54] I will utter a good word only when I see some good quality in you
[29:58] I'm so sure that you must be doing the same misbehavior with them as well
[30:03] its Nawal & Sultana's patience who kept on tolerating your rubbish
[30:08] otherwise, nobody can tolerate your non-sense!
[30:10] mom, did you hear that? Ask her to be quiet otherwise I will also forget my manners
[30:15] Okay aunty please...
and you! go to your room
[30:18] one shouldn't fight on every matter
[30:20] Tell her that there is no need to visit our house next time
[30:24] otherwise, nobody will be as bad as me
[30:44] Sultana, please sit
[30:52] how do you guys tolerate her?
[30:55] stop it, sister!
[30:57] You can see, how upset we are
[31:00] aunty, mom is already not well her BP is high at all times
[31:04] since you have kept such a tension in your house, so high BP is evident
[31:08] mom, please come & take rest
[31:10] yes Sultana, Nawal is right. Go, take some rest
I am also leaving
[31:15] I will come again once Safder is here. Go, take some rest
[31:21] somebody has sent that press conference's video to that company
[31:25] I am sure, Hamza must have sent it
[31:29] who else can do it?
[31:30] Yes, but...  you know that such things always create a negative impact
[31:36] I know...
[31:38] I know that
[31:41] Kabir see, the company wants to separate you from the partnership
[31:57] how?
[31:59] you know me very well, right?
You are my friend
[32:03] whatever allegations they are putting on me are baseless, its all a lie
[32:08] I know that, but the company doesn't know
[32:11] they think that a person can be harmful for the company whose image is not right
[32:17] but don't you worry, I am talking to them
[32:21] somehow we'll find a solution for it
[32:25] Thank you so much, Qaiser
[32:29] Hamza is doing all of this to make me suffer loss
[32:32] don't worry
[32:34] he will not achieve his goal
[32:46] what's the problem! What is wrong with her?
[32:48] She isn't drinking the milk, neither she is sleeping. She is just crying
[32:52] I think she is suffering with fever
[32:54] nothing happened to her, she is perfectly fine
[32:56] take her away from here and try to make her go to sleep in another room
[32:59] hold her for sometime
[33:01] elderly people say that children can recognize their mother's fragrance, she will become quiet
[33:04] has anyone asked for your suggestion?
[33:06] do as I have asked you to do? 
Don't talk rubbish, take her away from here
[33:10] Okay
[33:13] what is this torment! I have got rid of her with a lot of difficultly, but again her responsibility has fallen on me
[33:19] hey, why is she crying?
[33:21] come here... come to me
[33:23] come to me...
[33:28] she is suffering with fever
[33:30] I had told maam Falak
[33:32] but she said that she is perfectly fine, take her to another room & make her go to sleep
[33:36] maam Falak is not paying any attention on her
[33:38] Ok, take her to mom's room
[33:41] Okay
[33:54] Falak
[33:56] what is your problem?
[33:57] I am observing, neither you are taking care of Ilham nor you are paying any attention towards her
[34:03] sister, I don't want to hear any of your lecture right now. I am already having a headache
[34:07] that child is suffering with a high grade fever, did you check once?
[34:11] if you didn't had to take care of her, then why were you swerving to bring her over here?
[34:14] As if you have done a very big favor by bringing her over here. You shouldn't have brought her
[34:18] since you have brought her here, then take care of her. I had already left her there, I had threw her away
[34:23] what are you saying!
[34:26] But you had said that Kabir had snatched Illham from you
[34:30] I had lied. Is this what you wanted to hear, right?
I had lied!
[34:35] I will spend my life as per my choice
[34:38] and I won't let anything become a chain in my life
[34:41] and neither I will let anyone become an obstacle in my way
[34:46] The allegation that you had put on Kabir & Aliya, was that a lie too?
[34:53] Yes, its a lie. Is this you wanted to hear?
[34:56] everything was a lie! I was frustrated from that life
[34:59] I have to take care of her at all times, I have to do everything for her
[35:02] I also had a life, and I wanted to spend my life as per my choice
[35:05] why I shall do all these things at all times?
[35:07] Besides, she is not only my child. She is Kabir's child too
[35:10] so he should handle her
[35:12] and if you guys cannot handle her too, then you guys can leave her the same way I had left her
[35:16] and if you guys cannot do this, then let me go & drop her over there
[35:19] have you gone mad! What are you trying to do?
[35:21] the same thing that I should have done long time ago
[35:34] you have slapped me!
[35:36] this is for all those lies that you have told me until today, Falak
[35:42] I kept on fighting with the entire world
[35:44] Falak, I kept believing you
[35:47] I kept feeling proud that there is no lacking in my upbringing
[35:53] but its proved now
[35:56] there was a lacking in my upbringing only
[36:02] You have broke my honor, Falak
[36:05] You haven't left me capable enough to face myself
[36:16] Mom... mom, what happened?
[36:19] mom!
[36:21] mom, are you fine?
Please sit, what happened?
[36:52] doctor, how is my mother's condition?
[36:54] See, she had a heart attack. Her condition is quite critical
[36:58] we cannot say anything for now
[37:00] what are you saying?
[37:01] Just now I have told you that her condition is quite critical
[37:05] doctor, I beg you. Do something, but save my mother
[37:09] believe me, we are trying our level best
[37:12] but God is the one who saves everyone
[37:14] have courage & pray for her
[37:16] God will do better
[37:17] God please bless my mother with good health. Nothing will happen to her
sister Nawal...
[37:22] don't you dare to come near to me
[37:25] neither I need your false consolation, nor you
[37:29] why are you blaming me?
[37:30] you are saying as if everything had happened because of me
[37:33] whom else I shall blame if not you?
[37:36] mom got a heart attack, and its just because of you
[37:38] if she is fighting the battle of life & death then its just because of you, Falak
[37:42] She couldn't tolerate that her own daughter has betrayed her
[37:47] no matter with whomsoever you have lied, but at least you could have told her the truth
[37:53] What she had thought of you, and what you have proved to be?
[37:56] Liar, cruel.. fraudster!
[37:59] I feel so sorry, what not she gave to you?
[38:03] Respect, honor and most importantly love. And what you gave her in return?
[38:08] Lie, betrayal...
[38:10] Falak, get away from me before I say something else to you
[38:14] go away from here
[38:36] heartiest congratulations to you! God has answered all of your prayers
[38:40] You mother is out of danger now
[38:43] in fact, she is perfectly alright
[38:45] We are shifting her in the room now, God willing she will gain conscience until morning
[38:51] Thank you, doctor...
[38:53] You are welcome
[39:27] mom...
[39:28] The allegation that you had put on Kabir & Aliya 
All of that was a lie.
[39:31]  I was frustrated from that life
[39:33] I have to take care of her at all times, I have to do everything for her
[39:36] I also had a life, and I wanted to spend my life as per my choice
[39:39] why I shall do all these things at all times?
[39:40] Besides, she is not only my child. She is Kabir's child too
[39:44] so he should handle her
