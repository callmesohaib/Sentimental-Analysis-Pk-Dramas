[01:39] I'm so sorry. Did you get hurt? Are you okay?
You broke my foot.
[01:45] I think its fractured.
[01:48] I'm so sorry. I didn't know when you came here. I was reversing the car.
[01:53] Please come, I'll take you to the hospital.
There's no need. I'll go myself.
[01:56] See, you're in a lot of pain. It doesn't look good. I'll remain guilty. Please come, I'll take you.
[02:04] Please. Please come.
[02:09] Be careful. Mind your foot.
[02:53] Its hurting a lot. This had to happen today. How will I attend the wedding tomorrow?
[03:01] I'm giving you this painkiller injection. You'll be at ease.
[03:05] I'll not get this injection. I want to go home. I'm scared of all this.
[03:10] Its just a painkiller. Get it. Its for your own good.
[03:12] No. I don't want it. I've never gotten an injection. I'm scared of the needle.
[03:16] Please look here. You don't have to look there.
[03:19] Look at me.
No. No. I'll go back home.
[03:21] Look at me.
No. I don't want this.
[03:24] Please talk to me.
[03:29] You tell me, I was going in my car. How did you come in front of it?
[03:35] Did I come in front of your car?
[03:37] Its all your fault. You brought you car there..
[03:45] I didn't know when you came in front of it, just like you didn't know when you got the injection. Its done.
[04:16] How do you feel now?
[04:20] Its a lot better.
[04:26] There is an ice cream parlor nearby. You'll feel good if you have ice cream. I feel that.
[04:34] No. Thank you. Please just drop me home.
[04:38] If mom finds out I had an accident, mom will be upset.
[04:41] As it is, I'm getting into a lot of accidents these days.
[04:44] What do you mean?
[04:46] Nothing. Just drop me home. Turn right from  here.
Okay.
[05:05] This.. this is my card.
[05:09] Inform me about your well being.
I'm fine. I don't think I need this now.
[05:16] You don't need anything but you can make one.
What do you mean?
[05:20] I mean, I care for you. You're in a lot of pain
[05:25] and after all this happened because of me so its my duty to know about your well being.
[05:32] Fine.
[05:37] Do inform me. I'll wait for you.
[06:05] You tell me, I was going in my car. I didn't realize when you came in front.
[06:11] Just like you didn't know about this injection. Its done.
[06:18] This is my card. Inform me about your well being.
[06:22] You're in a lot of pain and after all this is because of me so its my duty to ask about your well being.
[06:39] Do inform me. I'll wait.
[06:48] Should I message or not? No. Not today. It will look weird.
[08:01] Hmm.. Brother? Who are you thinking about?
Nothing brother. Just like that.
[08:08] Really? So tell me, how is the response of the new branch?
[08:13] The response was good. In fact very good.
[08:17] Do you know, our manager was telling me that all tables have been reserved for until next week
[08:25] Oh wow. Amazing. Congratulations.
[08:28] Thank you so much. But you need to congratulate your wife as well because without her it would have been impossible.
[08:35] You know brother, there are so many new investors who want to invest with us and I'm hopeful that we'll open a new branch very soon.
[08:45] As God wills.
As God wills.
[08:47] So Touqeer, did you talk to the event planner?
Mam I have talked to the planner and don't worry. I'll handle everything.
[08:55] So, we have Farheen's daughter's wedding function tomorrow. Please come home early, you both.
[09:01] Both of you have to go with you. She asks about the two of you always and I have to make an excuse.
[09:07] Now its not a small event but a close wedding. No excuses.
[09:13] Alright. We'll go. As you say.
[09:28] Sister..
Hmm?
[09:31] Sister?
[09:34] You don't even know how to get ready? Is this dress suitable for the wedding function?
[09:40] Darken your lipstick at least. You have no fashion sense. Darken it.
[09:44] No. I don't want to darken it. I like it like that.
[09:47] Please, darken it a little at least. Sometimes I feel you have an old soul possessing you.
[09:52] We're going to a wedding event.
I said I'm fine. Now lets go, we're getting late.
[09:58] Look at me.
[10:01] Am  I not looking I the most beautiful girl in the world?
[10:04] Of course. You're the most beautiful in the world. Now should we go before the event finishes?
[10:50] Please come. I'll make you meet everyone. This is Aaliya. She is my favorite cousin.
Really?
[10:57] She is younger than me but she's very mature.
And Farheen, he?
[11:01] He is her husband, Touqeer, and this handsome lad here is her brother in law, Kabeer.
Hello.
[11:10] And Aaliya, she is Mrs. Sultana. Both these beautiful girls are her daughters, Nawal and Falak.
All praise to the Lord.
[11:27] And Nawal is my daughter Anaya's childhood friend.
[11:32] I don't know why I feel we've met before.
Yes. I think we met in a restaurant. Right?
[11:39] Yes, what a beautiful coincidence. Our fate is making us meet again and again.
[11:45] What if we keep meeting with this coincidence and then our fates intertwined too.
[11:50] Kabeer and his talks.
[13:18] Is your foot better now? Is it hurting?
Its a lot better now. I'm fine.
[13:28] You didn't message me about your well being.
[13:32] You have no idea how worried I was about you.
[13:36] I kept your card somewhere and forgot about it.
[13:41] Hmm. You know what?
[13:45] I thought I am not someone people can ignore but you broke my heart.
[13:54] I am like this.
[13:59] Its not your fault.
[14:03] If you're beautiful, you're bound to be complacent.
Its not your fault.
[14:06] Its not your fault.
[14:12] Tell me one thing. Do you judge everyone like this?
[14:16] Of course not. Such a beautiful coincidence has never happened before.
[14:22] Do you compliment every beautiful girl like this?
[14:28] I've seen such a beautiful girl for the first time. Someone who is ignoring me.
[14:34] I didn't compliment.
Then why are you wasting your precious time on me.
[14:41] I don't think I'm wasting my time.
Then what do you think?
[14:47] I think its the first time I'm spending time where I want too. I feel happy with you.
[15:00] Do you?
[15:23] I was amazed today. Kabeer didn't even once tell me that he is bored.
[15:30] If we go on such functions, he always complaints that he's bored.
By the way you're absolutely right.
[15:38] I didn't even see him anywhere.
Hmm..
[15:42] Where were you?
[15:43] I was there. There were a lot of people from our circle so I was busy talking to them.
[15:51] Hmm..
[15:54] I had a lot of fun too. I enjoyed a lot. And I also liked a girl for Kabeer in the function.
[16:06] What? What are you saying? Please don't take away my independence yet. Let me be free.
Really?
[16:18] Dear, you've been free for a long time. Everybody has to get married one day. Get ready now.
[16:27] Alright, tell me, who is she.
I did take a picture and you've met her as well.
[16:35] Show me the picture first, then I'd know who she is. How will I remember otherwise who I met?
[16:42] But you don't want to get married. Whats the use of looking at the picture?
[16:47] I didn't say I don't want to get married.
But you just said that you don't want to give away your freedom.
[16:53] Exactly.
I was just joking. I believe in what brother says. Its something everyone has to do.
[17:02] Alright..
Obedient.
[17:06] All praise to the Lord.
So, where is it? Come here. Look at this.
[17:15] Sister in law. How did you find out whats in my heart?
So you have now accepted my choice?
[17:22] I knew you'd like Nawal. You know I really liked Nawal. She's so sober and mature. I know a girl like Nawal will suit him very well.
[17:36] Sister in law, wait a minute. You're mistaken. I don't like Nawal. I like Falak.
What?
[17:52] Falak?
Yes.
[17:54] Are you serious? I thought she was stupid. I know she's beautiful.
[18:04] But we cannot spend our life with our beauty. In fact Farheen was praising Nawal and her sensibility to me.
[18:14] She is very innocent and beautiful. What you think is her stupidity, that's her innocence and I really like her.
[18:29] Do you know brother, its the first time. The first time that I looked at a girl and felt as if she was made for me.
[18:38] Wait a minute. The thing is that my brother has been flattered and since he has to spend his life, so it should be his choice as well.
[18:50] Lets not force him and get him married to Falak.
Alright dear. Okay.
[18:58] Kabeer's happiness is most important to us so we'll take a proposal for Falak. Happy now?
Very happy.
[19:09] This is why I say you're the best sister in law in the world.
And you're the best wife in the world as well.
[20:05] Nawal do you have any idea who is taking over our company?
[20:09] No. I don't know. As it is, what difference does it make? We have to work only.
[20:15] Hmm. It is a new company and they're launching in Pakistan for the first time.
[20:23] I'm very scared. What will become of us?
[20:28] Who knows how they'll be? I've also heard they'll fire 50% of the staff.
[20:39] See, Sara, its very straight.
[20:44] Those who are doing their job fine, why would a new company fire people who are doing their jobs?
[20:53] You do your work. Don't focus here or there or else there will be no guarantee of your job.
[21:00] Aren't you scared?
[21:01] No. Why would I be scared? I'll work somewhere else if not else.
[21:07] I have firm belief that where God has written bounties in your fate, you get it no matter what.
[21:15] And if its not written, no matter how much you try, you'll return empty handed.
[21:28] Excuse me mam. The new boss is joining tomorrow and he has called a meeting at 2pm.
[21:33] Okay. Do one thing. Keep all the files ready.
[21:38] I will have to give them to him tomorrow only. Also compile all meetings held last month in a file and email them to me.
[21:47] Okay, mam.
[21:50] Alright Nawal, I'll go and check if some work is left.
[22:01] Come. Have a seat, please.
Thank you.
[22:10] We came to see you with a special purpose.
[22:13] Of course. Tell me.
Shaheen, get some refreshments dear.
[22:21] I cannot see Nawal and Falak.
[22:24] Nawal must be on her way back.
By the way, is everything alright? You called to see me in an emergency.
[22:33] I was worried.
[22:35] Yes everything is alright, thank God. Actually when I met you yesterday, I was very happy.
[22:42] Even I was glad to meet you.
[22:47] You met her brother in law yesterday.
[22:52] Kabeer?
[22:53] Yes.
[22:55] Actually I really found both your daughters very sensible and well brought up.
[23:06] Nawal and Falak, I really liked them both.
Thank you very much.
[23:13] I'm looking for a girl for my brother in law these days and I'm here with a proposal from Kabeer for Falak.
[23:31] Falak?
[23:41] You have met Kabeer, you've seen him. Kabeer will keep Falak very happy.
[23:52] Yes. I'm very happy that you came. Thank you very much but I cannot accept this proposal.
[24:08] Actually Nawal is my elder daughter and Falak is younger.
[24:11] If you had brought a proposal for Nawal I would have said yes but since its for Falak, I'll have to say no.
[24:26] I want to get my elder daughter Nawal married first and then Falak.
[24:38] In times like today, when an educated woman like you says such a thing, one is certainly surprised.
[24:46] These are old wives tales. These days people don't wait to get their older daughters married first. This happened in the past.
[24:54] You're right.
[24:56] But everybody has their own thinking and I also think that I should get my elder daughter married first and then the younger one.
[25:09] I will not force you at all but I'll tell you to discuss it with Nawal and Falak before you decide.
[25:21] Whatever you decision is, you can call me. Whether you accept it or reject it, I'll not oppose it.
[25:30] Alright Aaliya if you're forcing me, I'll definitely talk to them and I hope nothing I said has hurt you.
[25:41] No. What are you saying? Its your right. They are your daughters.
[25:46] Of course you'll decide what you think is best for them.
[25:54] I really liked talking to you, today. Please I'll take your leave now.
Oh, how can it be?
[26:02] You haven't eaten anything yet. The tea will be here any moment.
[26:05] No. Thank you. We actually opened our new branch recently and there is a lot of work there. Kabeer and I are usually busy there.
[26:14] I'll wait for your call.
Alright, then.
[26:20] Should we leave Farheen? Okay bye.
Bye.
[26:38] I'll have to say no because you brought the proposal for Falak. I'll get Nawal married first and then Falak later.
[26:50] Why did mom say no to this proposal? They're such nice people. So rich. I don't know why she's doing this.
[27:12] Mom, where is Falak?
[27:15] She is in her room. She isn't feeling well. I've asked Shaheen to send her tea in her room.
[27:24] Aaliya came today.
Really? What happened? Why was she here?
[27:29] She brought a proposal from her brother in law Kabeer, for Falak.
What?
[27:36] Mom, this is such a good news. Why did you wait before telling me? You're telling me so late.
[27:42] What is so good about it?
[27:44] She didn't bring a proposal for you. Its for Falak
[27:47] So what? Falak got a proposal from such a good family. Its good news.
[27:56] I said no.
[27:58] What are you saying, sister in law? She said no. Why?
[28:03] She wants to marry her elder daughter first.
[28:08] Aaliya you should have tried to convince her.
[28:10] What do you think? I didn't try? You're the limit.
[28:17] I think I'm the best in public dealings among the three of us.
[28:21] This is weird. Will she keep her younger daughter home, all her life, if her eldest isn't married first?
[28:28] I've told you a thousand times Nawal. You're elder than Falak. You'll get married first
[28:35] Mom, the proposal is from such a good family.
[28:39] He is the owner of such a big business. He is good looking. There is nothing amiss.
[28:43] What else do we need? People look for these things in a proposal.
[28:46] What difference does it make if I or Falak get married first?
[28:51] Tell me, did you mention this to Falak? Did you tell her?
[28:55] I'm her mother. I'll decide. What does Falak know? She's a child.
[29:04] Mom, you should have asked first before saying no.
[29:08] You did wrong, you should have asked her first. The proposal was for her. She should know.
[29:14] If you had to say No, you could have at least mentioned it to her.
[29:17] Don't make me understand. I understand everything. You'll be married first because you're elder than her.
[29:22] They said no with a useless reason. She could have asked for some time to think.
[29:28] And Aaliya you should have also verified first whether her elder daughter was engaged or not.
[29:35] I knew it. I did my homework before I went.
[29:38] Mom when I have no objections, why are you objecting?
[29:43] How can I make you understand dear?
[29:46] If I marry off Falak first and you're not married by then,
[29:53] everybody will talk. They'll question why I got Falak married first.
[29:59] For God's sake mom. We're not answerable to anyone. We have to do whats best for us.
[30:05] What people say or do shouldn't make a difference to us.
[30:09] It does make a difference to me. This is why I did what I did.
[30:24] I think you should talk one more time.
[30:28] I don't think its feasible. She has said what she wants very clearly.
[30:39] I don't know, its weird. Both of them have their own fates. Its not as if they're intertwined.
[30:50] Everybody has their own thinking.
[30:53] But even after she said no, I requested her to discuss with her daughters and then call me.
[31:03] Alright. We can do nothing more. As it is, my brother doesn't lack girls. We'll find someone else.
[31:12] Brother, what is wrong with you? How can we find another girl? I like Falak and I want to marry her. Its not a joke.
[31:20] How will I marry someone else without liking her?
[31:23] That's why they say matches are made in heaven. This was not meant to be. We'll find the one for you.
[31:36] I really like their family. They're simple people. They have a valid point as well. I was thinking, if we,
[31:47] could just ask them for Nawal.
Wait a minute.
[31:54]  What is wrong with you people? You're not taking it seriously.
[32:07] Kabeer.. We..
Kabeer.. Kabeer.. Oh..
[32:20] What do you think about Nawal?
[32:26] Aaliya please stop it. 
[32:30] Why did you have to take Nawal's name in front of him?
[32:34] We cannot force anyone. We sent a proposal but they said no. What can we do?
[32:43] I'm saying, you should find a good girl in your social circle or in our family. They are so many girls around.
[32:50] You're right. I have some in mind.
[32:55] As it is, my brother lacks nothing. You'll see, he'll find a very good girl.
[33:03] Touqeer I've never seen Kabeer reacting like this ever before.
[33:14] You're right.
[33:51] Hello?
[33:53] Hie. Kabeer. Its Falak. I'm very sorry. I couldn't call or text you. I was a little busy.
[34:03] Really. So you want to show me that I'm worthless for you.
[34:07] No. Its nothing like that. You're misunderstanding.
[34:12] It is so.
[34:13] I'm telling you, its not that. As it is, I have very few people in my life who I think of as mine. You're one of them.
[34:25] Really. If this is so, Why did you say no to my proposal?
[34:32] What? What proposal are you talking about?
[34:35] I don't know about it.
[34:37] Falak I'm talking about my proposal. Aaliya brought a proposal from me. For you.
[34:43] Seriously. I don't know about it. Mom didn't tell me.
[34:49] Are you kidding? How is it possible that she didn't mention it to you.
[34:55] Believe me, Kabeer. Mom didn't tell me about it.
Okay.
[35:02] If she had asked you, what would you say?
[35:09] I think I would have said yes.
[35:12] Okay. I've got my answer. 
[35:16] I think you should talk to your mother so that when my sister in law talks to her. She cannot say no.
[35:23] Okay.
Its good to know your consent. I'm happy. Can you feel it too?
[35:32] May be.
[35:34] May be? This means I'll have to meet you to show how happy I am.
[35:41] No. How can I meet you? Its very difficult.
[35:45] If your intentions are clear, its easy to get what you want. Think of it as what I want.
[35:51] I want to have dinner with you today.
But..
[35:55] Its a request.
Alright. I'll try.
[38:16] Why did you have to do all this?
[38:19] Its nothing. 
[38:22] You hold a very strong position in my heart.
[38:30] If I could, I would have brought all the roses in the city for your welcome, here.
[38:39] Falak. Your presence here is lightened up the room. Some people are like this.
[38:49] Who knows when they enter someone's life, like a bright light.
[38:56]  I want your love to brighten up my life. Forever.
[39:04] Will you support me?
[39:12] I'm asking you, for your life.
[39:31] Will you hold my hand?
