[00:12] If you can work in Kabir's company then why can't I work in Hamza's company?
[00:17] Kabir is my ex-husband and Hamza is your ex-fiance so the matter is same on both sides.
[00:23] Take it and talk to her.
[00:26] I don't want to talk to her. I hate her and I don't want to see her face.
[00:32] Whatever decision you make but I wont accept this proposal.
[00:36] Go and drop her at her house immediately.
[00:38] With whom have you come?
[00:42] Are you spying on me?
[00:43] Will you marry to that girl?
[00:47] What did she do with her own sister?
[00:51] This type of girl can't be loyal to anyone.
[01:04] She can't be loyal and sincere to anyone.
[01:07] They grown her up, fed her well and did everything for her
[01:12] but she did this to them in response of their good deeds and kindness?
[01:25] Such an oblivious girl can never become my daughter-in-law.
[01:37] Stop mentioning her name again and again.
[01:43] Mom this is my life and I should have the right to make decisions about my life.
[01:49] When children make decisions egoistically and in stubbornness
[01:52] then it's parents' duty to advise them and guide them towards right path.
[02:01] My son, marriage is not a child's play. It's not a matter of a day, a week or a month.
[02:10] With whom you will get married, you will have to spend your whole life with her.
[02:16] But I have made the decision.
[02:19] Now there is no room for Nawal in my life.
[02:27] And I wont change my decision despite your insistence.
[02:56] You will have to drink it. Please have it.
OK, I will drink in a while.
[03:02] Madam, Manager from office has come to meet you.
[03:06] Yes, send him in my child.
[03:10] Why has he come? Let's see.
[03:16] Greetings. Greetings Mr. Manager. Have a seat.
Thank you.
[03:21] Is there everything alright that you have come here?
[03:23] Yes, I need Mr. Hamza's signatures on this file so he has called me here.
[03:29] But Hamza is not at home.
[03:32] I have just talked to him on phone. He is coming in five minutes.
[03:35] OK, you can wait for him. Will you take tea or anything else?
No, thank you.
[03:40] OK, by the way Mr. Ahmed tell me about the situation of company and are all projects going well?
[03:49] Yes company's situation is absolutely fine. We are working on two or three mega projects.
[03:55] I am supervising two of them while the other one is being supervised by miss Falak.
[04:01] Falak? Nawal's younger sister?
Yes.
[04:06] When did Hamza hire her?
It's been so many days.
[04:12] I heard that she has suffered a big loss.
[04:17] Her business partner ran away after taking all her money.
[04:24] Who has told you?
[04:25] All staff members know about that.
[04:27] Miss Falak sold her property share and invested the amount in business with someone.
[04:34] Her partner did fraud with her. She was very worried so Mr. Hamza hired her.
[04:42] And he handed over such a big project soon after he hired her
[04:46] .
Yes, rather I told Mr. Hamza that she has not much experience.
[04:51] He said that I am with her and I will look after that.
[04:55] Please don't tell him about this conversation. He will get angry.
[04:59] No, I wont tell him anything.
[05:02] Hey, bring tea or something else for Mr. Ahmed. OK. I will take rest.
Sure
[05:07] Ok, thank you!
[05:10] I don't believe that Hamza will turn out that much fool.
[05:13] He doing foolish acts and Falak is exploiting that.
[05:21] She has lost billions of rupees and she has become poor so she needs money.
[05:27] That's why she is trapping my son because she knows that my son has money and established business.
[05:32] If Hamza will get married to her than she will own everything and all her worries will go away.
[05:40] Look at her cleverness and her planning.
[05:44] First she got job in his office then she cause difference between Nawal and Hamza and trapped my son.
[05:50] She is too much. Because my son is not like that. She has spoiled his mind.
[05:56] Mom she is doing the same trick which she has been doing with Kabir and Aliya.
[06:00] I am understanding this whether Hamza agree with me or not.
[06:05] And Falak has exploited the emotional nature of Hamza.
[06:09] You know that how much he used to love Nawal.
[06:19] How can he decide to marry Falak suddenly?
[06:23] I can't digest this. He was so happy
[06:27] when Nawal got convinced to marry him.
[06:31] What has happened in few weeks that he doesn't want to marry Nawal but he wants to marry Falak.
[06:39] I don't understand what is going on. Do one thing, call Nawal and tell her.
[06:47] What do I tell her and how can I talk to her mom?
[06:52] Hasn't Hamza humiliated me in front of her? I can't face Nawal.
[06:57] I am sure that this girl is trapping my son for money.
[07:01] Yes, that's the only explanation.
[07:08] Do one thing,
[07:11] meet Falak alone without letting anyone know.
[07:16] Tell her that we will give her whatever she wants but get out of my son's life. For God's sake don't ruin my son's life.
[07:27] No mom, this is not right.
[07:32] And is this right what is happening right now? The life of my only son is going to get ruined.
[07:36] I can't sit without doing anything. I will have to do something.
[07:40] Will you talk to her or do I talk to her myself?
[07:43] OK mom, I will talk to her. Please relax.
[08:16] Sister Nazish, you are here at this time?
[08:24] Yes, I want to meet you and discuss something important.
[08:30] Please have a seat.
I don't want to sit. It's OK.
[08:36] What happened, is everything alright? You are in angry mood.
[08:39] Listen Falak, I wont tell you long stories.
[08:44] I got the information that you invested your money somewhere and you have lost all your money.
[08:51] Yes, I invested in a production house but she ran away with my money.
[08:58] So it means that you don't have any money right now.
[09:03] You have transferred the ownership of this house to Nawal
[09:06] so you will definitely need money in this situation.
[09:10] Who doesn't need money?
So that's why you are trapping Hamza.
[09:17] Is this right? Tell me.
[09:20] He is beautiful, handsome and smart. He has servants, bungalow and cars and everything else. What else do you need?
[09:27] Are you in your senses? What are you talking about?
[09:30] Listen Falak, take how much money you want but get out of Hamza's life.
[09:39] How can you even think like that?
[09:44] Perhaps you don't know but I am not trapping your brother.
[09:48] He himself proposed me himself. I didn't force him to marry me.
[09:52] Tell this to that person who believes on your words.
[09:57] I know it very well that it was you who created misunderstandings between Hamza and Nawal.
[10:02] Really? But how can you say that?
[10:06] I don't want to argue with you.
[10:08] You will tell Hamza right now right away that you can't get married to him.
[10:12] And tell me how much money you need, I will transfer that to your account.
[10:18] How stupid your thinking is.
[10:22] Earlier I didn't think about getting married to him
[10:26] but now I wont think rather I am going to meet Hamza and I will accept his proposal.
[11:07] You?
[11:10] What are you doing here? I told you that don't come here because it is not beneficial.
[11:15] Do you know that by rejecting your proposal with whom Hamza is going to get married?
[11:19] It doesn't make any difference to me no matter with whom Hamza is getting married.
[11:23] When you will listen her name then it will definitely make difference and you wont be able to stand on your feet.
[11:32] When he left me after accusing me and my character then I don't care with whom he is getting married.
[11:38] He is getting married to Falak.
[11:46] Did it make difference. Did you lose ground under your feet?
[11:53] What are you talking about?
[11:57] Hamza has expressed his intent to get married to Falak.
[12:03] He has not only expressed his intention rather he is showing his stubbornness for that.
[12:09] No, Falak can't do that because she is my sister.
[12:16] You are so innocent and simple as well.
[12:20] Man forgets every relation for the sake of his own benefit.
[12:26] And Hamza is a well educated, beautiful and rich man.
[12:32] He is not short of anything
[12:35] and girls do idealize such type of boys who can provide them all luxuries in life along with love.
[12:51] Listen Nawal.
[12:53] Me and mom wished that Hamza would get married to you.
[12:59] I don't know what happens next.
[13:04] Just pray that whatever may happen that benefit all of us.
[13:14] Take care.
[14:03] Hamza, sister Nazish came to our house today.
[14:08] She was offering me cash.
[14:10] She said that get out of Hamza's life and take as much money as you want.
[14:16] I am very sorry Falak. I didn't have any idea that her hate will go to that extent.
[14:24] She said this to me today.
[14:27] She thinks that I am getting married to you for money.
[14:30] Falak don't worry. I know that sister has done very wrong to you.
[14:35] I will definitely talk to her about that.
[14:38] She has said this to me.
[14:41] She has said this today, I don't know who will she say in future.
[14:44] She thinks that I am getting married to you because of your wealth and reputation.
[14:47] I can bear everything but I can't bear such allegations on my self respect.
[14:53] Don't worry.
[14:55] I am with you. Right?
[14:58] I know Hamza. But to whom will I tell if sister Nazish will keep behaving like this and keep saying such things after marriage?
[15:06] I wont be able to complain in front of you.
[15:12] Don't worry.
[15:14] You are my honor and I wont let anyone cause damage to my honor.
[15:19] You know Hamza, I would never agree to get married to you.
[15:23] But after seeing your love and sincerity I couldn't refuse.
[15:30] I know that all of this is not easy.
[15:33] It's very difficult to convince your family and that to for me.
[15:38] But I am becoming part of your life by trusting you.
[15:42] Don't break my trust ever.
[15:44] Falak, trust me, that will never happen.
[15:52] Fix your mood first.
[16:18] Falak.
[16:24] With whom were you? Don't lie to me.
[16:31] Why will I lie to you? I was with Hamza.
[16:35] Are you getting married to Hamza?
[16:37] Sister has told me everything.
[16:42] I am asking something from you. Are you getting married to Hamza?
[16:47] I am not doing that. He has proposed me.
[16:53] And by the way, what difference does this make to you? Your engagement has already been broken. Right?
[16:59] If he didn't get married to you then he will get married to someone else and he wont live a bachelor life.
[17:03] Then why not he marry me?
[17:05] So you called him there that day, that was your planning to take me there?
[17:11] Yes, I intentionally took you there.
[17:13] And I called Hamza and asked him to come there.
[17:16] Why did you do this to me Falak?
[17:19] Because I wanted to get married to him. I liked him.
[17:24] But no, he loved you. Right?
[17:27] He was blind in your love.
[17:29] So I had to do something to create misunderstandings between both of you.
[17:34] I didn't have idea that you will turn out to be that much oblivious.
[17:37] Stop, it's enough.
[17:40] Look at yourself once before taunting me.
[17:44] Have you ever seen yourself? Do you deserve a man like Hamza?
[17:48] You are just beautiful but look at me, I am more beautiful than you. I am intelligent and I understand everything.
[17:55] How do you get everything.
[17:57] I kept thinking throughout my life that how are you so successful?
[18:02] You were always ahead of me but I kept trying to follow you.
[18:09] I thought that I will get everything after getting married to a successful man like Kabir but what happened?
[18:16] You got engaged with Hamza who was much better than Kabir.
[18:22] I wanted to get all those cars, fame and wealth because that was my destiny.
[18:27] My fate should have shined but your fate was shined.
[18:31] I can't tolerate all of this.
[18:34] I advised you so much that sister please reject this proposal but you didn't do that.
[18:41] So I snatched what I wanted.
[18:45] Do you know that you were not able to get him.
[18:49] Why did you do that Falak?
[18:52] We supported you and did everything for you but you didn't deserve that Falak.
[18:59] I loved you so much but you gave me this reward?
[19:08] But I am not lowly like you.
[19:11] I am giving you respite to stay tonight.
[19:15] Then get lost from this house tomorrow morning and I don't want to see your face in this house otherwise I will treat you in a very bad way.
[19:22] Get lost.
[20:25] Get lost from here.
[20:27] Hamza.
[20:28] Why are you looking at him? This is my house.
[20:31] I am asking you to get out of here.
[20:49] Hamza, where were you? I am waiting for you since long.
[20:53] I want to discuss something important with you. Come and sit.
Wait!
[20:58] First tell me that why did you go to Falak's house?
[21:03] I went to advise Falak.
[21:06] To advise her?
[21:08] by thinking what you had offered money to Falak? That she will take money from you if you offer her?
[21:15] Instead of advising her you should correct your thoughts.
[21:19] I am feeling embarrassed.
[21:21] Hamza, I am doing this for your happiness
[21:25] For my happiness? Are you doing this for my happiness?
[21:31] If you cared about my happiness then instead being so stubborn you would take my proposal to Falak's house with mom
[21:38] to fix my marriage but what did you do?
[21:44] I am so disappointed.
[22:22] Hello!
[22:28] Why are you crying Falak?
[22:30] Sister Nawal has slapped me and scolded me so much.
[22:36] She has asked me to leave this house.
[22:39] What? But why?
[22:41] I am standing on the road right now.
[22:44] Where will I go now Hamza? I don't know anyone except you Hamza.
[22:51] Listen, you don't have to worry at all.
[22:53] Stay there, I will pick you in fifteen minutes.
[22:58] Please come quickly.
OK.
[23:21] What difference does it make.
[23:24] If Hamza didn't get married to you then he will get married to someone else and wont live a bachelor life.
[23:29] Then why not he marry me.
[23:34] Yes, I took you there intentionally and I called Hamza and asked him to come there
[23:39] because I wanted to get married to him.
[23:41] I liked Hamza.
[23:45] But he loved you and he was blind in your love
[23:49] so to create misunderstandings between both of you I had to do something.
[23:53] I advised you so much that reject this proposal but you didn't do that.
[23:58] Then I snatched what I wanted to get.
[24:16] Madam Nawal, I have cooked the food. Do I serve that on table?
[24:23] I am not feeling hungry. Go to sleep.
[24:27] OK.
[24:53] Will I live here Hamza?
[24:57] Yes, you will have to stay here tonight.
[25:00] Hamza, I can't stay here.
[25:02] Falak don't worry, I will do something.
[25:05] What else can I do except getting worried? 
[25:08] I have come here after closing all doors behind me.
[25:15] I am afraid that you will not fulfill your promise because of your family's pressure. 
[25:20] What will I do and where will I go Hamza?
[25:23] Falak, this wont happen.
[25:27] It's OK then, let's get married now.
[25:41] No one can do anything with us after Nikah.
[25:44] And then aunt and sister will only become angry and scold us and taunt us but we will bear that and convince them.
[25:51] At least she wont kick us out of the house. Right?
[26:03] Hamza, you will have to make this decision.
[26:18] Elham, dad will come soon.
[26:22] OK Noor, give her milk on time. Right?
[26:26] Good bye. And video call me if there is any problem.
[26:30] Oh, sorry buddy.
Can I give you an advice?
[26:35] Yes, tell me
Get married again.
[26:40] Are you joking?
[26:43] I am not joking. I am serious.
[26:46] You should think about getting married again rather you should have done that by now.
[26:52] Not at all, it is not required at all.
[26:56] I had a very bad experience from my first marriage.
[26:58] That's why I don't want to even think about second marriage.
[27:01] Listen Kabir, Elham needs a mother.
[27:05] There should be someone who takes care of her.
[27:08] I have hired a maid. She is very good and experienced and take good care of her.
[27:13] And why do you think that a father can't bring up his children in a proper way?
[27:18] Listen, I think no matter how good or experienced a maid is but she can't take care of baby like a mother.
[27:28] And father can't give love to his children like a mother.
[27:31] Am I right?
[27:33] Think about my advice.
[27:36] I think you haven't listened the stories about step mothers.
[27:39] Why do step mothers assumed like a witch in our society?
[27:44] They can also be good. Right?
OK fine buddy.
[27:48] I will think about it. Now let's talk about business.
[27:51]  I have to go home as well. It's Elham's time to go to sleep.
[27:55] That's why I am asking you to get married again. Sister-in-law will handle everything.
[28:01] OK, OK, no marriage talks, let's talk about business. What were you saying?
[28:08] OK.
[28:09] I really liked Mr. Yasir's proposal. 
[28:13] He has good resources and access to store as well. I think we can have a good deal with him
[28:19]  If you trust him then we can talk to him.
[29:17] Stay happy and stay blessed with a lots of love.
[29:40] Falak you are getting married to Hamza Hashim son of Hashim Hussain with a dower money of five billion in presence of these witnesses. 
[29:48] Do you accept?
[29:50] I accept.
[30:45] Greetings Kabir.
Greetings, Nawal you?
[30:50] How are you?
[30:52] Actually, I came here to meet Elham. I was feeling sad.
[30:57] I am so sorry, Elham has just slept.
[31:03] Didn't you feel bad that I have come here?
[31:06] No, why will I feel bad? You are embarrassing me. 
[31:10] You can come here any time. Please sit.
[31:17] Nawal, are you alright? Is there anything? You are looking upset.
[31:26] You can share with me.
[31:31] Kabir you were right.
[31:34] What?
[31:36] That day, Falak asked Hamza to come here.
[31:40] Did you see, as I told you that only Falak can do this.
[31:47] Only she can call Hamza but you weren't believing me.
[31:52] It is my mistake.
[31:55] I was thinking that she is my sister and she can't do this but she did that.
[32:05] And do you know that why she did that?
[32:11] Why?
[32:15] To get Hamza.
[32:18] What?
[32:21] What are you talking about Nawal?
[32:23] Kabir both of them are getting married.
[32:31] I don't believe this. It's unbelievable.
[32:37] It's fine whatever she did to me but how can she do this to you? You are her sister.
[32:45] And you have supported her throughout her life.
[32:51] How can someone be that lowly to ruin her own sister's house?
[33:00] But Hamza claimed to love you so much. 
[33:06] He changed so quickly?
[33:09] Did he forget all his promises?
[33:16] People are selfish and oblivious like this.
[33:27] No one cares about others.
[33:30] Look at Falak, she didn't care about anyone. 
[33:34] At she should have cared about her daughter.
[33:40] She only spent this much time to forget everything and move forward.
[33:48] You are right, some people are selfish and oblivious.
[33:57] They don't give importance to relations.
[34:00] But whatever has happened it's good for us 
[34:04] because it has revealed their real face in front of us.
[34:08] And we wont trust on any one so soon in our life.
[34:22] I am sorry, I should leave now.
[34:25] Nawal.
[34:26] Nawal please don't go in this condition. Your condition is not good.
[34:32] Let me drop you.
No, I will go by myself.
[34:37] Truly speaking, I have become conscious now.
[34:43] My eyes have been opened now and I am able to see everything clearly.
[34:51] Please stay with Elham she can wake up any time. I will go by myself.
[34:59] OK
[35:13] Where has he gone? I am unable to understand.
[35:16] I am worried since last night. Call him.
[35:19] I am trying to call him since long but his number is switched off.
[36:12] Hamza, what is all of this?
[36:16] Falak & I have got married.
[36:24] From today she is my wife and she will live in this house as well.
[36:43] Hamza are you in your senses?
[36:46] I am in my complete senses sister.
[36:54] I told you that I want to get married to Falak but you didn't get agree with me.
[37:01] That's why I had no other option to get married to her.
[37:05] This is not possible.
[37:07] You can't take such a big step without our advice. She must have provoked you.
[37:13] Don't say anything to Falak, talk to me whatever you want to say.
[37:20] Because I had forced Falak to marry me.
[37:26] Stop this nonsense Hamza. I know such type of girls very well.
[37:31] Mom please.
[37:35] Falak is my wife.
[37:38] Don't say any weird thing about her.
[37:41] I will say what I want to say. I will say what is in my heart..
[37:44] I don't accept this marriage. Get her out of my house right now right away.
[37:53] Get out. Get lost from here.
[37:56] Hamza.
[37:57] Why are you looking at him. This is my house. I am telling you to get out of here.
[38:03] Hamza, what is aunt saying?
[38:08] Mom what are you saying?
I am telling her to leave my house.
[38:13] I wont let her stay in my house at any cost.
[38:19] Remember one thing mom that if Falak will leave this house then I will also leave this house.
[38:32] Falak will stay there where I will live.
[38:36] What? Are you listening? Will he leave his mother and sister for this girl?
[38:43] Will you fight with us? No one likes her. 
[38:46] Have I done your brought up for this day that you will bring a girl like her to my house?
[38:51] Mom, Falak is my wife. If you want me to live in this house then she will also live here.
[38:59] Mom, please go to your room. Please.
[39:03] No, Nazish let me talk to him. He has gone mad. Tell him.
[39:11] This girl can't become daughter-in-law of this house.
[39:14] Hamza I order you to divorce this girl right now right away.
[39:21] Mom what are you talking about?
Didn't you listen what I have said to you?
[39:24] Falak what happened?
[39:25] I am not feeling well Hamza.
Falak control yourself.
[39:29] My head is spinning, please let me sit somewhere.
[39:34] Come, let's go to the room.
