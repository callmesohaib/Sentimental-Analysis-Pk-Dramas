[00:15] It's not your fault.
[00:18] If God gives you beauty then delicacy comes as well.
[00:22] We are happy that you came here. Thank you so much.
[00:26] But
[00:28] I can't accept this proposal.
[00:33] I am telling you that here is no such thing.
[00:36] And by the way
[00:37] I have very few people in my life.
[00:40] Whom I considered my own.
[00:49] I want my life to be lighten up forever due to your love.
[00:58] Will you support me?
[01:05] I am asking your life from you.
[01:25] You can hold my hand.
[01:58] I want this moment to freeze forever.
[02:07] I am really happy.
[02:12] Are you happy as well?
[02:16] I want to hear from you.
[02:19] Because love is dependent on words.
[02:25] I am happy Kabir.
[02:29] So happy.
[02:33] Thank you.
[03:00] Sister
Hmm
[03:02] Sister, did you talk to Falak's mom?
[03:04] No, I didn't call her.
[03:06] Well, she told me that she won't marry Falak earlier.
[03:10] Then what do I talk to her? Even then I requested her.
[03:14] That take your time for thinking and then tell us. So she will tell us.
[03:17] Yes, but ask her once again.
[03:20] I feel that Falak's mom didn't ask Falak about her consent.
[03:25] What happened to you Kabir?
[03:27] It is said that fruit of patience is sweet.
[03:32] How much do I wait?
[03:34] OK, please talk to her once on my insistence. I insist you.
[03:39] Please.
[03:43] OK, if you insist then I will talk to her. Are you happy now?
[03:48] Thank you.
[03:50] I am frying something for midnight snacks, do I fry for you?
[03:53] No thanks, I am full.
[03:55] OK
[03:57] Crazy.
[04:58] Falak
[05:09] You don't have fever.
[05:11] Yes, I am fine.
[05:13] Falak, I am observing since last night that you are in your room and you slept without having dinner. This never happened earlier.
[05:18] There is no such thing sister, I had headache.
[05:22] Mom told me and I was about to come into your room but then I thought that you should take rest.
[05:27] Yes, I slept after taking medicine.
[05:33] Sister, I want to talk to you.
[05:38] Excuse me.
[05:43] Greetings.
[05:45] I am just leaving.
[05:48] And when will be the meeting?
[05:50] Just give me half an hour, I will be there. OK bye.
[05:54] Falak, I am so sorry, I have to reach there.
[05:58] Let's talk in the evening. OK.
[06:00] Just give me a call if you need anything.
[08:41] Sir, she is miss Nawal, our finance manager.
[08:44] Miss Nawal, he is sir Hamza, our new boss.
[09:17] Sir please come with me. Let me introduce to remaining staff.
[09:48] Miss Nawal, he is sir Hamza, our new boss.
[10:55] Nawal
[10:56] I am warning you, if you call my name.
[11:02] After seeing you all my old wounds have become fresh again.
[11:09] Nawal, can we forget all old things?
[11:10] Those were not only just things, that was love, my love.
[11:15] Which you trampled under your feet.
[11:23] I am so embarrassed.
[11:26] I did very wrong to you.
[11:30] Because of your mistake, I thought about taking my life.
[11:36] I had been in depression because of you.
[11:40] I even stopped thinking about life.
[11:47] Nawal, I am really embarrassed.
[11:50] If I wouldn't have gone abroad at that time then I would miss my career development.
[11:53] I wouldn't get anything.
[11:54] You have dealt a lot of damage.
[11:57] The one who gets love, he needs nothing else.
[12:02] You preferred wealth over love.
[12:06] You had gone to develop your career by putting me on stake.
[12:10] And that too without telling and without saying anything.
[12:16] Please sit.
[12:17] Hamza, don't consider me as old Nawal.
[12:21] I had buried her there, where you had left her.
[12:28] You knew that I am working here, that's why you intentionally bought this company.
[12:34] So that you can bother me.
[12:37] No, I swear there is no such thing.
[12:40] The decision of buying a company is taken by board of directors, it's not my decision.
[12:44] I didn't know at all that you are working here.
[12:48] I will resign tomorrow, you will get my resignation.
No, please.
[12:52] Don't do any such thing.
[12:55] Nawal, can't we forget everything and move forward towards each other like earlier.
[13:03] Don't even think about it.
[13:06] We can never be the same again.
[13:10] Yes, if you want me continue my job here then there will be no discussion about our past life.
[13:19] Neither you will discuss that nor I.
[13:27] OK
[13:29] It will be as you wish.
[13:36] Excuse me.
[14:16] Bring tea for me.
[14:19] Is there everything alright?
[14:20] You have come back earlier than me today.
[14:23] Didn't you go for visit?
[14:25] Sister
[14:26] I was not feeling well, that's why.
[14:29] Why? What happened to your health?
[14:32] Nothing substantial.
[14:34] It's just a headache.
[14:37] Did you talk to Falak's mother?
[14:41] No, I didn't talk to her.
[14:48] To heal your headache, take tea.
[14:52] Yes, I will take it. I have to do an important work. I will be back.
[15:04] Now, I will have to talk to her.
[15:09] Shaheen, make a black coffee for me.
OK
[15:19] Greetings
[15:21] Greetings
[15:22] What's the matter my child, you are looking so tired?
[15:27] No, it's because of office workload.
[15:32] OK
[15:36] Hello
[15:38] Greetings Aliya.
[15:40] How are you?
[15:42] I am fine, how about you?
[15:44] I am also fine by the grace of God.
[15:46] I was waiting for your call but you didn't call me.
[15:51] Have you consulted with Nawal and Falak?
[16:01] Listen Aliya, I told you at that time.
[16:05] I will arrange Nawal's marriage first and Falak will get marriage later so there is no point of discussing this topic.
[16:12] Please think about it once again.
[16:16] In the case of daughters, one should not be hasty like this.
[16:19] I don't think that I have taken this decision in a hurry. I have taken this decision very thoughtfully.
[16:25] I hope Aliya that you will understand my position.
[16:32] Bye
[16:38] Why did you do that?
[16:40] You refused again. I told you that don't refuse but you didn't even bother to listen to me.
[16:46] I don't act according to others' instructions.
[16:49] I have decided. Now, whether it's you or anyone else will force me to change me decision, I won't do that.
[16:55] Mom, why don't you understand?
[16:57] It is not good thing to reject such a good proposal.
[17:00] Arrange Falak's marriage, when it's my turn I will also get married. Will you keep her unmarried because of me?
[17:15] Falak, you?
[17:19] I always considered you as my own.
[17:22] But I had no idea that you have never considered me as your own.
[17:26] I have heard your discussion.
[17:29] If there was any proposal for me then you should have asked me but you didn't even bothered to ask me.
[17:35] Mom, I am not objecting on your refusal.
[17:38] But I object on this that you would have asked me.
[17:42] What would I ask you?
[17:45] What would I ask?
[17:47] When it is fixed that you can't get married in any case before Nawal's marriage.
[17:52] And who has fixed it? You?
[17:55] If that proposal was for your real daughter, would you refuse that as well?
[17:59] Falak why do you discuss this real and others' daughter topic all the time?
[18:03] So tell me, what do I say?
[18:06] If I would have been her real sister then would she do that?
[18:08] To refuse only because of this reason that I can't get married before your marriage, it's not justice.
[18:14] I think there is something else.
[18:17] What do you feel?
[18:19] Tell me, I want to listen, what do you feel?
[18:22] That why will you bear that your real daughter keep sitting in home while your servant's daughter would get married in a well known family.
[18:35] What are you talking about Falak?
[18:37] I am absolutely right.
[18:38] How will you bear?
[18:41] That I married in a rich family. You consider me as daughter of your servant so you will find a servant's proposal for me.
[18:46] How will you bear that I will be treated on equal terms with your daughter?
[18:50] Are you listening?
[18:51] What is she saying?
[18:54] I have brought you up being a mother.
[18:57] I never felt any difference between you and Nawal.
[19:00] And she is saying that I want that she don't get married in a rich family.
[19:06] You are lying mom. You are absolutely lying.
[19:09] You never considered me as a real daughter. You brought me up only because you want to get praised by the people
[19:16] That people will praise you that you are so generous that you have brought up your servant's daughter.
[19:20] Stop Falak, it's enough.
[19:23] Why do I stop? Why are you asking me to keep quiet?
[19:25] If she would have brought me up like a mother then she would never reject that proposal instead she would marry me happily.
[19:31] Tell me Falak.
[19:33] Who has injected this poison in your mind?
[19:35] This is not poison, it's reality mom.
[19:38] You wouldn't digest that such a good proposal came for a servant's daughter.
[19:42] If the same proposal would come for your real daughter then you wouldn't refuse that. You are getting jealous mom.
[19:47] You are getting jealous.
[19:48] Falak
[20:27] Falak, Falak listen to me.
[20:34] What did you do?
[20:42] Falak, Falak listen to me my dear.
[20:46] You are a selfish man, who only cares about his career, his business and his happiness.
[20:53] Anyone else happiness and words don't have any importance in your eyes.
[21:16] Falak
[21:20] Falak, open the door.
[21:22] Go from here, I don't want to talk to anyone.
[21:26] Falak I won't go from here, you will have to open the door.
[21:34] Falak
[21:39] Do you have any idea that how much mom has hurt because of your words?
[21:42] And does any one care, how much I am hurt?
[21:45] Falak, you didn't like her words. Right?
[21:48] Then you should have talked to her but you stood in front of her.
[21:52] Is this the right way?
[21:54] There is a proper way to talk.
[21:57] You want to marry Kabir so you should have said that clearly.
[22:01] Is this appropriate for you to misbehave so much with mom?
[22:05] I kept saying all of this without thinking out of anger.
[22:09] Tell me, if my parents were alive then would they let this happen to me?
[22:15] Falak, since our childhood mom never felt any difference between you and me.
[22:24] Then how can you even think that she will do that to you?
Then why did she slap me?
[22:31] Falak
[22:33] You made her angry, you were talking nonsense.
[22:44] I was so angry.
[22:46] I made a mistake, I am embarrassed.
[22:49] I said so much because of anger.
[22:52] Tell mom that I will act according to her wishes.
[22:55] And if she doesn't like that I will marry to Kabir then I will never marry him.
[23:00] I will marry wherever and whenever she will want me to marry.
[23:15] Falak don't get suspicious about your own relatives.
[23:20] The bond of relationship gets weakened when a person assumes the answers to the questions arising due to misunderstandings.
[23:26] Believe me, there will never be any injustice with you in this house.
[23:40] When mom's anger cools down then you will go there and apologize to her.
[23:47] OK
[23:49] She must definitely crying there. Let me see her.
[23:54] Silly girl
[24:34] Mom
[24:35] Nawal
[24:38] If you are here to advocate for her then I don't want to listen to you.
[24:47] Go and tell her.
[24:51] Don't talk to me.
[24:53] Mom she is young, don't take her words seriously, she just said that out of anger.
[24:59] I don't want to discuss this topic.
[25:02] She is crying in her room and you are crying here.
[25:05] How will this issue resolve if you don't talk to each other?
[25:10] She has raised question on my motherhood because of a strange boy.
[25:25] She stood in front of me by forgetting every relation.
[25:31] She went to the extent of anger that she felt that
[25:43] I am not her mother and you are not her sister.
[25:47] Mom don't say that. Try to understand.
[25:52] You should have talked to her. She is sad that you didn't even discuss with her.
[26:02] I don't want to discuss this topic.
[26:05] Go
[26:06] Close the door behind you.
[26:51] Hey my wife.
[26:53] I have told you so many times that don't bring office work at home.
[26:59] It's the limit.
[27:02] I am thinking about something else.
[27:06] OK
[27:07] So, let me know about that problem due to which my wife is thinking so much.
[27:16] Actually
[27:20] I called Mrs. Sultana again on insistence of Kabir.
[27:31] She refused again.
[27:34] Aliya, what was the need to call her?
[27:37] You shouldn't have called her in the first place.
[27:40] One time refusal is enough for a wise person.
[27:44] Kabir is very serious for Falak.
[27:47] I have never seen him so serious for any girl.
[27:51] Oho, he is not a kid, he is a mature person, he will understand.
[27:54] You are not taking me seriously.
[28:00] OK, I will talk to him and make him understand.
[28:05] In the meanwhile find a good girl in your social circle, so that we will arrange his engagement and get him married soon as well.
[28:16] Kabir is dear to me like brothers.
[28:20] I will try my level best that he may get his desired girl.
[28:30] Aliya why are you stretching this closed matter like a rubber?
[28:36] I mean, come on let's move on, the world doesn't end on one girl.
[28:40] And Kabir is wise enough so you should also act wisely.
[28:45] I can't see Kabir in this problem.
[28:48] I am thinking to talk to Mrs. Sultana again. There is no harm in talking to her. Perhaps she got convinced.
[28:58] Remember my words.
[29:02] Forceful decisions don't last long.
[29:06] Else, as you wish.
[29:08] Anyways, I am sleepy so I am going to sleep. Please switch off the lights.
[29:16] Good night.
[29:35] Excuse me, you are coming in my snaps again and again, please take a side.
[30:32] The number you have dialed is powered off.
[30:48] Sister Nawal, are you going to office? Please take me with you.
[30:53] But today is your off day.
[30:55] Yes, I have to go to grave of mom and dad.
[30:58] I am feeling sad.
[31:02] So early in the morning, Falak?
[31:05] Yes, I was very disturbed since night.
[31:08] The burden of my heart will go when I will go to graves of mom and dad. Please drop me there.
[31:13] I will take you there myself on my off day.
[31:16] No, I want to go today.
[31:19] Falak, it's not right to go there alone.
[31:23] I am missing them so much.
[31:25] I will get relax when I go to graveyard.
[31:27] Agree with me.
[31:30] Go to your room and take rest. OK.
[31:32] I will take you on my off day.
[31:57] I was reviewing your work.
[32:00] You have done your work wonderfully, there is not a single mistake.
[32:04] It is evident that you have worked really hard.
[32:07] Thanks
[32:11] Have a seat.
[32:23] Nawal, I know that I have done so much injustice to you.
[32:26] Please
[32:28] We promised yesterday that we won't discuss anything related to our past life.
[32:37] I just want to apologize to you.
[32:40] I just want to say to you.
I don't want to listen anything.
[32:44] Why do I believe you?
[32:47] You are a selfish man who only cares about his career, his business and his happiness.
[32:55] Any one else happiness and words don't have any importance to you.
[33:02] Please try to make sure that it would be better if we don't discuss this topic ever again.
[33:08] Otherwise, I have so many reason to leave this place.
[33:19] Do you want to discuss anything related to official work?
[33:52] I want to go mom and dad graves. I am feeling very sad. I am missing them so much.
[33:57] I will get better when I will go to graveyard.
[34:02] If she didn't get her love like me then she will live her life with this agony as well.
[34:12] I won't let this happen.
[34:15] Falak you will definitely get your love.
[34:19] I won't let any injustice happen to Falak. Why would she face that agony like me?
[34:30] Mom
[34:33] Please agree with me.
[34:37] I don't want this at all that Falak will feel that she is not my real sister.
[34:42] She has become suspicious of us due to a small misunderstanding.
[34:46] And this confusion can be removed only in this way.
[34:52] She has misbehaved with me so much, Nawal.
[34:58] I will not agree with you.
[35:02] I have considered her as my own daughter during my life.
[35:08] I have brought her up with so much love.
[35:12] Didn't you see?
[35:14] In one moment she parted ways.
[35:19] She didn't think about me.
[35:28] Mom she is so embarrassed.
[35:31] She has said that she will act according your wishes.
[35:37] So, what's the problem?
[35:39] If Falak doesn't want to get married then why are you forcing me?
[35:44] Because I know that she is not happy.
[35:48] No one lives happily without love.
[35:52] No matter how we pretend from outside to be happy but from inside we are sad.
[36:01] OK, unlock the phone.
[36:25] Greetings
[36:26] Greetings Aliya, I am Nawal, how are you?
[36:30] I am absolutely fine.
[36:32] Actually, me and mom wanted to meet you. Are you at home?
[36:37] OK, I have just reached home. Come anytime.
[36:41] OK, let's meet.
[36:43] Sure, bye.
[36:59] I have accepted your opinion.
[37:02] But I have one condition.
[37:06] I will only arrange engagement of Falak at the moment.
[37:11] But you will get married earlier than Falak.
[37:14] Why are you showing stubbornness mom?
[37:17] I will get married when time will come.
[37:22] Please agree for my sake.
[37:26] OK, get up. Get ready.
[37:29] Come on.
[37:31] Come, come.
[37:42] Come please, have a seat.
[37:46] Thank you so much.
[37:48] Well my child.
[37:52] Tell me, what will you take? Tea or coffee?
[37:55] We will take that later, first let's discuss that topic for which we have come here.
[38:00] Sure.
[38:01] Yes, go ahead.
[38:05] Well, you brought proposal for Falak.
[38:11] And I refused you straight away.
[38:15] Actually, I think that it's not appropriate to marry younger daughter when there is an elder sister is unmarried.
[38:27] Are you getting my point?
[38:30] All children are equal in the eyes of mother.
[38:33] Yes, I am getting your point.
[38:35] But Nawal advised me.
[38:39] That refusing such a good proposal is like rejection of blessing.
[38:43] God gets angry because of it.
[38:46] And it's the same thing whether younger sister get married first or elder sister get married first.
[38:51] The objective is to marry our daughters in a good family.
[38:57] I am a mother.
[39:00] And mothers are very concerned about their daughters.
[39:05] You don't have to worry at all, Falak will live very happily here.
[39:09] She won't miss anything here.
[39:11] You will not regret on your decision.
[39:14] God willing.
[39:16] And Nawal's fate is with her.
[39:20] By the grace of God she is well educated, sober and intelligent.
[39:24] And she is so beautiful as well, God willing she will get married in a very good family as well.
[39:30] God willing.
[39:32] I am really happy. Hey Nasreen bring the sweets quickly.
