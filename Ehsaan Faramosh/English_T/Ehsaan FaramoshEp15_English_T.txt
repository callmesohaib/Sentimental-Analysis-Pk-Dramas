[01:14] Kabeer..
[01:22] Are you in a bad mood?
[01:24] No. I'm fine.
[01:28] I know you're upset with me. I should be the one to be upset.
[01:33] I was insulted. I was taunted and I had to apologize.
[01:37] For something I didn't do. I didn't say anything against sister Aaliya.
[01:46] Didn't you say that she called us back from the honeymoon deliberately.
[01:52] You knew Hafsa was lost and yet you said this. How could you?
[02:00] Everybody was worried in the house. How could we stay there in such a situation?
[02:05] Everybody is worried here and we should enjoy our honeymoon?
[02:10] Falak, you can do that but I cannot.
[02:17] Kabeer...
[02:21] Kabeer, I'm telling you the truth, I didn't say anything. I don't know what sister Aaliya heard herself. I didn't say anything.
[02:31] This means sister Aaliya is lying?
[02:33] So, am I lying Kabeer?
[02:40] I was angry and I said that she should have been with Hafsa and take care of her.
[02:46] Family is important, more than the business. I have said that in front of everyone.
[02:57] See Falak,
[03:00] you know how much I respect sister Aaliya.
[03:05] She got hurt with what you said.
That's why I apologized.
[03:12] Because I knew nobody cared for the truth.
[03:18] I've decided that I will not talk to anyone in this house. I will not discuss anybody's matters.
[03:25] Falak nobody in this house wants you to react this way. This is your house. You're a part of this house.
[03:31] Had I been a part of this house, I wouldn't have been insulted for every little thing.
[03:42] Falak, I love you very much.
[03:47] They brought you in this house because I wished for it.
[03:51] That's why I cannot think of living away from you
[03:58] and that's why I expect so much from you.
[04:02] I told you earlier as well. I respect sister Aaliya very much.
[04:09] In fact she is just like my mother.
[04:12] I'll never tolerate anything wrong for sister Aaliya.
[04:18] You should be careful as well.
[04:22] You know where to place which relation. You're that sensible
[04:27] to know how much respect you should be giving a relationship.
[04:36] Mistrust is built on such small things.
[04:40] Homes are destroyed
[04:44] and I expect that you'll never want this house to be broken.
[04:49] I'll be careful.
[04:52] Thank you so much.
[04:55] You always understand me.
[04:59] Now if you allow me, can I go to the office?
[05:18] Call me..
Bye.
[05:27] I apologized because of you. Otherwise I've never bent down in front of anyone.
[05:33] I'll never forget it.
[05:40] Hello?
[05:43] Hie. You here?
[05:45] Yes. Why are you so shocked? Can I not visit your office?
[05:50] Of course you can. Sit down.
[05:53] I'm not here to sit. I want to have lunch. Get up lets go.
[05:58] But I cannot go. I have a very important meeting. Clients are waiting.
[06:03] Oh come on Hamza. These lame excuses won't work with me.
[06:07] If you have a meeting, cancel it. Its not a big deal for you. As it is you're the boss, not an employee.
[06:14] We'll go have lunch now and then I want to go shopping and then on a long drive.
[06:22] First, if you wanted to go for lunch, you should have told me earlier. I wouldn't have scheduled a meeting
[06:28] but now that I have, I cannot cancel it.
[06:32] And secondly, I don't like any outings during office hour.
[06:39] You know this very well.
[06:42] I give my business importance when its time to work
[06:45] so we're neither going for lunch, nor shopping or a long drive.
[07:00] Start the meeting, I'm coming.
[07:31] Falak? Where are you? You're always shut in your room. Why don't you come out?
[07:38] I'm not feeling well.
[07:41] What happened? If you say we'll go to the doctor.
[07:44] I don't understand your honey-coated talks.
[07:50] Are you upset with me?
[07:52] How dare I be upset with you? Only you have the right to be angry or upset in this house.
[08:01] I know you were hurt about the apology.
[08:06] Kabeer didn't do good, his attitude was wrong. I made him understand.
[08:13] Why did you make him understand? His reaction was according to what was told to him.
[08:18] God knows what truth, what lies he was told.
Falak.
[08:23] I hate lies and why would I want you and Kabeer to have differences.
[08:30] Take this out of your heart.
[08:33] It was a coincidence that Kabeer heard me and Touqeer.
[08:37] Wow. What a good coincidence that you heard me and Kabeer heard you.
[08:45] You're changing the meaning of what I said.
[08:49] I'm upset that you had to come back because of me.
[08:54] You're right in your place and your anger is natural.
[08:59] Its my fault. I was wrong in judging you.
[09:05] I'm sorry. See, forget whatever happened. Fix your mood. I apologize.
[09:21] I was tired of your call so I called myself. Tell me what have you decided?
[09:27] I told you my decision that day only.
[09:30] See, understand my problem. I cannot sell this house.
[09:36] This means you hold this house more precious that your daughter's happiness.
[09:40] See, Asjad is under depression.
[09:43] He says why should he be marrying into a house where nobody cares when he's in trouble?
[09:48] What are you saying?
[09:50] You are talking about calling the relationship off?
[09:53] Relationships are based o consideration and if there's no consideration, there's no use for a relationship, Sultana.
[10:01] See, I've told you earlier as well that we didn't want any dowry. We're ready to have the wedding as you like.
[10:07] Don't you want your other son in law to be a businessman like your first one?
[10:14] Its not like that. You should try and understand my problem Nausheen.
[10:19] I cannot sell this house but I will ask Safdar,
[10:25] he can transfer as much money as he can to Asjad's account.
[10:29] Asjad isn't begging you. You don't have a son of your own to save the house for.
[10:35] Whatever you have, its your daughters and its best if you can give it to her in your life.
[10:40] I think you didn't think it through.
[10:45] So think about it and give me a final answer. Bye.
[10:59] What happened mom? Whose call was it?
[11:03] Nobody dear.
[11:09] Why do you look so worried?
[11:15] Nausheen called.
[11:18] She was asking what I had decided.
[11:23] Then tell her that we're not selling the house.
[11:25] I think Nausheen is right. Nawal whatever I have is yours.
[11:33] Then why shouldn't I do this in my life only.
[11:37] I don't want more mom. I will get whatever is in my fate.
[11:42] I was thinking I'd call Safdar and ask him to transfer money to Asjad's account.
[11:50] Maybe we'll not need this then.
[11:52] Mom, what are you saying? You'll not send money to anyone.
[11:55] He is the son in law of our house. If we don't look after him, who will?
[12:00] What should we do if he's your son in law. We cannot cater to his senseless wishes.
[12:06] We respect him, what else does he want.
[12:10] We didn't ask him to start a new company. If he didn't have any investments, he shouldn't have started it.
[12:15] We should do whatever we can afford only.
[12:17] You don't understand dear, this relationship is fragile and I don't want my rules to break this relationship.
[12:28] If this want to call it off because of this, they can. It won't make a difference to me.
[12:37] Its better to stay unmarried rather than marrying into such greedy people.
[12:41] God forbid. What are you saying? This is the problem of today's generation.
[12:48] You think relationships are a game. You call if off whenever you feel like.
[12:55] I fear what you're saying.
[12:58] After all this, Asjad has lost all respect in my eyes.
[13:05] Go and tell them no
[13:10] or should I go and tell them no.
[13:15] I don't worry about people mom. Its better to cry once than to cry all my life.
[13:23] Nawal, you're not doing anything. Do you understand?
[13:35] Thank you so much. No. I love the color. You know its one of my favorite colors.
[13:40] Its very decent. Just the way I like it. Well cut.
[13:45] Of course. I got it made for dinner. Yeah. Alright. Okay.
[13:52] You know I'm also looking forward to it. Bye.
[14:41] Hello?
Aunty called mom and threatened to call off the wedding.
[14:48] I don't know. If she said this, she would have thought things through.
[14:55] So it won't make a difference to you if she calls off the engagement?
[14:59] When there is no consideration, whats the use of a relationship?
[15:02] And what about greed over consideration? What do you think about it?
[15:07] There's no use arguing Nawal. Its clear you don't bother about what we have to say.
[15:14] Asjad your demand is unreasonable.
[15:17] We only have this house to live and if we sell it, where will we go?
[15:23] Then there is no problem. We get small furnished apartments on a good rent.
[15:30] Mom will have nowhere to live. I cannot even think about it.
[15:34] Asjad., I didn't know you were selfish. If you wanted money, you could have arranged it.
[15:40] Why are you pressurizing us to sell the house?
How would I arrange the money?
[15:45] I think you people don't trust me. You think I'll run away with the money.
[15:50] Its not about trust, its about consideration. Where did your tall claims go?
[15:57] Asjad I'm very upset. You're not at all what I thought you'd be. Its best if we part ways.
[17:32] See Sultana, this isn't a big thing. I don't think what they're demanding is wrong.
[17:37] People give furnished houses to their daughters in dowry.
[17:43] They didn't ask for any such thing. What if they had asked you for this before the wedding, you'd have done so.
[17:49] Do it now and it'll be a favor from you.
See Arifa, listen to me.
[17:54] You know me very well. Its not about the house.
[17:58] Its about my daughter's happiness. When she's not happy, what can I do?
[18:04] Oh, make Nawal understand. Asjad is such a nice guy. You don't find such proposals.
[18:11] Ok fine
[18:13] I accept that they asked for the money because they weren't in a good financial situation
[18:17] but the way they said so wasn't good. Nawal is hurt.
[18:24] And its clear, they reek of greed.
Oh. Try and understand that they're helpless.
[18:29] Make Nawal understand. Whats the guarantee that the other proposal that comes won't be as demanding?
[18:38] People have become so demanding that there's no comparison. You have no idea.
[18:42] Go out and see and you'll touch your ears. And then they'll seem like angels to you.
[18:48] Listen to me Arifa. I can sell not one but ten houses for my daughter's happiness.
[18:56] But the way they talked, I didn't like it at all. They threatened to call of the wedding.
[19:02] Their intention is clear now. They were waiting for things to be official and make such a demand.
[19:09] Oh, you don't know what people said during Falak's wedding.
[19:14] They said that she was earning and you wanted to live on her earning or maybe she had an affair.
[19:26] How many people will you stop from talking?
[19:28] If they call off this engagement, people will definitely think something is wrong.
[19:35] I thought you were sensible. Nawal is emotional but you're sensible.
[19:40] How many tongues will you stop? If she ages, you'll not find any good matches.
[19:56] I have tried to make you understand. Its upto you now. Do whatever you want to do.
[20:17] Oh. The iron is ruined. The scarf will burn. Nasreen come here.
[20:30] Nasreen.. Nasreen. Nasreen.
Yes mam what is it?
[20:36] Where is Hafsa? Call her.
Yes mam.
[20:38] Hafsa? Hafsa?
sister, What happened?
[20:46] See what she did with my clothes. I had to wear this on a dinner.
[20:50] She did wrong. Why did she do this?
[20:53] Yes mom?
Hafsa tell me. What did you do dear?
[21:00] Oh, why are you so angry?
[21:02] Hafsa destroyed Aaliya's dress mischievously.
[21:08] Hafsa did?
[21:11] She has never done this before. God knows whats wrong with her. I'm amazed myself.
[21:15] Hafsa you never did this before. Whats wrong with you?
[21:19] Don't scold her. Its alright.
Falak. Wait a minute.
[21:23] Hafsa..
We need to reprimand kids on their mistakes. Otherwise...
[21:28] Hafsa why did you do this dear? You've never done this.
I didn't...
[21:33] Let it be Kabeer. She has already been scolded by sister Aaliya. She's scared and now you've started..
[21:40] Hafsa.. Hafsa..
[21:45] Whats wrong with her?
[22:46] Kabeer?
[22:51] Whether you accept or not, Hafsa is feeling neglected that's why she's doing all this.
[22:59] If kids don't get attention in this age,
[23:02] They sometimes do such things.
[23:06] First she got lost and now she spoiled her dress.
[23:11] Of course she wants attention.
[23:16] I think she's doing everything deliberately so that sister Aaliya will pay attention to her.
[23:26] I know you'll say that you're here, Touqeer is here but the attention she can give, nobody else can.
[23:42] I'll go and get you tea. I'll check on Hafsa as well if she needs anything.
[24:05] Iron this dress right now.
Mam I want to tell you something.
[24:10] Tell me later but right now I'm getting late.
No. Its important.
[24:15] Tell me.
Actually I saw Falak leaving your room a while ago.
[24:25] Falak? What was she doing in my room? What does she have here?
[24:29] I kept your dress here, it was alright. Hafsa left with me 
[24:35] and I saw Falak leaving your room like thieves. She went to her room.
[24:44] I have to go to the dinner. Iron my clothes first.
[25:28] People give their daughters furnished houses, cars, what else. What if they had demanded everything after the wedding? 
[25:35] You'd have given them then too. Its good if you do it now.
[25:50] Asjad is a very nice guy. We don't find such good boys so easily. 
[25:55] Everybody was talking in Falak's wedding that you married your younger daughter first.
[26:00] People said that she earned so you wanted to live on her earning or maybe Nawal had an affair.
[26:05]  If they say no to this proposal, people will think something is wrong.
[26:13] People have become so demanding these days, you have no idea. 
[26:16] Go out and see and you'll think they're angels. 
[26:22] If she gets to a certain age, you'll not find any proposals.
[27:05] Mam, did you want something?
[27:08] No. 
[27:10] People say that we shouldn't hire employs in the house who have their ears, eyes and tongues open.
[27:18] We should be throwing them out.
[27:20] Mam I made a mistake, forgive me.
[27:26] If you make the same mistake again or try and be clever. Understood?
[27:33] I understand. Don't worry.
[27:42] Oh wow. Seems like we have something special today. 
[27:49] Is it special?
Yes I made everything myself.
[27:57] Go and call sister Aaliya.
She went outside for dinner.
[28:05] Oh. I made so much special dinner so that we'd eat together.
[28:11] Its alright. Don't be upset. Sister Aaliya has official dinners usually. We're used to of it.
[28:17] You might not miss her but I do. 
[28:20] This is the only time when we sit together and talk 
[28:24] and sister Aaliya, needs to think about herself. She's always working. What if she gets sick?
[28:30] Actually it was an official dinner. If it wasn't important, she wouldn't have gone.
[28:35] Had I been in place of sister Aaliya, I'd never value business over family. 
[28:40] I wouldn't like if Kabeer got in the habit of having dinner without me.
[28:49] Please eat. I got these kebabs made as well. Kabeer please have these.
[30:03] What are you doing here?
[30:07] Just looking at your things.
[30:11] Barging into someone's room and looking at their things, its not good at all.
[30:22] You've changed a lot.
[30:29] Should I take it as a compliment or something else?
[30:35] Take it as a compliment. Change is good and I really liked looking at all this.
[30:45] I'm just amazed how can someone change so fast. As long as I remember,
[30:53] book reading wasn't your hobby and the colors in this room, you never liked them.
[31:04] How can someone change so much? Reason.
[31:08] I'm very tired. I want to rest. Close the door on your way out.
[31:14] Wait.
[31:19] Tell me.
[31:20] Why are you running from me?
[31:24] Alizeh I know why mom called you.
[31:31] But whatever you and mom want, it can't happen. 
[31:40] Coming in my path again and again, hurting my ego. Its not good for you.
[31:51] Its best if you'd go back.
[32:53] Touqeer, I'm very tired today.
[32:59] Who asked you to go? You shouldn't have gone.
[33:03] You have never said such a thing ever before.
[33:08] See Aaliya.
[33:11] Frankly speaking, I feel like you've made yourself busy in your business and social life, more than whats needed.
[33:20] You aren't giving any time to family or this house.
[33:23] It was an official dinner. I had to go.
[33:27] Aaliya we only have dinner together as a family and usually you're out at this time.
[33:35] You know I wouldn't have gone if it hadn't been important.
[33:42] I'll try to be careful.
[33:48] See I'm just telling you that don't get yourself so involved in your business and social life to make your health suffer.
[34:02] You should take care of yourself. 
[34:09] Anyhow, goodnight.
[34:39] I need your support. I thought I'd ask you to get a loan from your company. 
[34:45] I need big investment. 
[34:49] There's no use having a relationship where there's no consideration.
[35:00] Nawal?
[35:03]  I've decided that I'm selling this house.
[35:09] what! Mom. What are you saying? Where will you go? What have you thought?
[35:19] I have a friend whose apartment is empty, she asked me to shift there.
[35:27] If you're afraid they'll say no, you don't have to be.
[35:32] My hands and feet are fine. I'm not disabled or weak.
[35:38] You're not weak but I'm not bold enough to answer questions people throw at me. 
[35:49] Everybody will ask the same question.
[35:53] The younger one is married, why was the elder one's engagement called off.
[36:00]  And if someone finds out about Hamza.
[36:08] What would people say? How many people will I clarify things to?
[36:15] Mom, I don't care about anyone.
[36:19] Do you think like that?
[36:24] I don't want to argue. I've decided.
[36:30] I want you to get married respectfully.
[36:33] If you think this will get me respect, you're mistaken.
[36:39] I will be under this burden all my life. I'll never be able to look myself in the eyes. Asjad's respect,
[36:48] the position of a husband, I'll never be able to give him that. Do you want such a life for me?
[36:57] We have to swallow bitterly for our own happiness.
[37:04] This will go waste. 
[37:09] You'll get married and you'll forget everything. Everything will be back to normal.
[37:14] Its upsetting.
[37:17] You never understood me.
[37:23] Nawal..
[37:50] She's here. We couldn't talk last night. How was dinner?
[37:59] It was good.
I was upset about your dress.
[38:04] I should be the one to be upset. 
[38:08] You couldn't clear your heart after I tried to make you understand so much.
[38:15] What do you mean?
[38:19] I mean, why did you have to spoil my dress? I'm not accusing you. 
[38:26] Nasreen told me she saw you coming out of my room.
[38:30] You're accusing me. You're lying. You insult me about everything. Every little thing. 
[38:39] What is my fault?
Wait a minute.
[38:43] What is the argument about? Whats all the racket?
[38:46] Kabeer listen to her. She said I spoiled her dress. It was Hafsa. She's accusing me.
[38:56] I'm not accusing her. Nasreen told me she saw her leaving my room.
[39:03] You're accusing me. If this is so, call her and ask her. Kabeer ask her.
[39:11] Alright. Nasreen. Come here. Nasreen.
[39:19] Tell them did you see her coming out of my room? 
[39:23] Did you see her spoiling my dress?
[39:30] Why are you quiet? Tell me. Tell them. Truth.
[39:35] I saw her leaving your room.
[39:44] I didn't see her spoiling your dress.
