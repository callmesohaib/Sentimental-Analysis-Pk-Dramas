[00:14] They can't see me happy. I fear that they might do something to my child and still you won't do anything.
[00:20] Falak!
[00:21] Don't you dare raise your hand on my daughter?
[00:26] For the peace of this house, someone has to leave this house.
[00:32] If not you, then we should go.
[00:35] To tell you the truth, I worry for my unborn child.
[00:40] Whatever I'm doing I'm doing for my child. That's why I want to forget everything and start life anew.
[00:46] I heard everything. She said that you created a lot of problems for her uncle.
[00:51] That's why he left home and bought a new home.
[00:55] You only have to cook for two people.
[00:58] Why don't you make it? Until we hire a maid, you'll have to manage the housework.
[01:03] Kabir, what's with you?
[01:18] Kabir... give me a cheque before you leave, and I'll cash it.
[01:23] A cheque, for what?
[01:25] I told you I needed to buy a few things to decorate the house.
[01:34] Falak, have patience, at least for a few days.
[01:38] Why should I? I told you about this.
[01:41] I've gotten what I wanted after a long time and you can't argue with me on this.
[01:46] I want to do everything as per my desire.
[01:49] How much money do you want?
[01:53] Ten lacs.
[01:56] Ten lacs... what will you do with that?
[02:00] What can one even buy with ten lacs?
[02:02] If you go to a branded shop you can't even buy curtains for ten lacs.
[02:05] Give me the money and forget about it.
[02:09] I need to buy things for my home.
[02:14] Alright... I'm giving you my credit card, you can buy whatever you want. But not more than ten lacs.
[02:20] I don't want a credit card...
[02:23] do you want to keep an eye on me? Do you want to see what I purchased?
[02:30] I don't want that. If you don't want to give me the money, then I don't. You don't trust me.
[02:35] What kind of things are you saying? I didn't mean it that way at all.
[02:40] Forget it.
[02:44] Alright... I'll transfer the money to your account, okay?
[02:49] Thank you.
[02:51] Bye*
[03:00] Looking at how busy I am in Canada I don't think I will be able to give you guys much time.
[03:05] Looking at the current state of the market...
[03:07] I don't think I will be able to be with you guys for long.
[03:11] Hamza, I know that there are certain problems between us.
[03:18] These problems are fixable if we talk about them.
I'm sorry Kabir.
[03:26] I don't have much time. I have to look after my businesses in Canada and Pakistan.
[03:31] That's why I've decided to remove all my shares from Kabir foods
[03:46] My team in Pakistan will contact you in a few days and will discuss the rest of it,
[03:52] Thank you
[04:00] Ma'am, I thought you said that Hamza was with us.
[04:04] He has decided to do this, but he hasn't followed through with it.
[04:09] I'll talk to Hamza, you guys need not worry.
[04:14] I want to assure you that Hamza will stay on board with us.
[04:18] Do you know what will happen if Mr. Hamza isn't on board? We'll have a lot of loss.
[04:25] Please don't panic... ups and downs are part of business.
[04:33] It's okay... just remember...
[04:37] that we won't let Hamza go.
[04:42] Even if he leaves, what problem will we have?
[04:47] Do you guys think we won't have an investor, another investor will take his place.
[04:53] There are many investors in the market who are ready to come on board.
[05:00] Yes... so... don't worry. Just calm down.
[05:14] Congratulations on your new house.
Thank you very much.
[05:19] Falak I missed you yesterday.
[05:21] I was busy, you know how much work it takes during shifting.
[05:25] Yes I know... we who live in rental homes know how hard it is to shift homes.
[05:33] Don't worry, one day you will have your home.
[05:40] Tell me... did you talk about the shoots? What did they say?
[05:44] Yes... I did talk to the production houses.
[05:47] But they can't shoot you today.... they are busy with the movie.
[05:51] Then when?
[05:54] I don't know... you were busy when they wanted you to shoot, now they're busy.
[06:01] Tell them about my condition.
[06:04] Falak, what's gotten into you... don't you dare say something like that?
[06:08] Please don't tell them about their condition.
[06:11] If they know about your condition, no one will cast you.
[06:16] And your career will end. No one casts married models nowadays.
[06:23] You're pregnant. If anyone knows about your pregnancy, they will cut you.
[06:32] Alright, I'll do as you say. But still, talk to them, maybe they'll agree to it.
[06:40] I'll talk to them.
[06:46] Lord knows when fate will shine upon me...
[06:50] don't worry... everything will be alright.
[06:53] This is only for a few months.
[06:57] After you're free, come to me. We'll start everything from where we left off.
[07:11] Sister, if Hamza withdraws his shares, it will create huge problems for us.
[07:18] Did you call him?
[07:21] I did... he didn't pick up.
[07:25] I don't understand what's with him.
[07:28] He's taking such a major decision because of Sherazi.
[07:32] He's not thinking about the good relationship that we have.
[07:42] First, it was Umar Hayat and now it's Hamza.
[07:47] Sister, we've lost all big investors in such a short span. If this keeps up... it will be a huge mess.
[07:53] I'll think about it.
[07:57] Tell me, how's Falak, is she fitting in her new home?
[08:03] She's fine for now. We don't have a maid yet, I asked you to arrange one.
[08:09] Yes, I did talk to her... she is at her village, she'll be here in a few days.
[08:14] I need to go on a visit. I'll leave.
Sure sister.
[08:18] I'll come home to meet my brother.
We'll see each other there.
[08:27] Did you talk to Falak?
[08:29] Yes... she's very happy. She's decorating her apartment.
[08:33] She's insane... why does she want to trouble herself in her state?
[08:38] I asked her the same thing and she answered...
[08:41] that she's getting what she wants after such a long time, so I said, alright.
[08:48] People have such veils over their faces... people like us can be easily fooled.
[08:56] That's true.
[08:59] Did you talk to Hamza? When are they coming?
[09:03] No, I haven't talked to him in a while.
Really?
[09:08] I'll Miss Sofia, let me ask her when he's coming back.
[09:12] I was thinking of setting a date for your wedding as soon as Falak delivers the child.
[09:18] Mother, Hamza said that brother Raheel's business is vast...
[09:23] It will take time to wrap it up.
[09:27] Anyways...
[09:29] Alright... may everything be well.
[09:32] I hope everything goes well.
[09:47] Falak.
[09:55] Falak.
[10:07] Falak.
[10:15] Falak.
[10:20] Falak.
[10:25] Falak.
[10:38] Falak.
[11:08] Hello...
Where are you Falak?
[11:13] I'm with my friends... I'll be back shortly.
Have you gone insane Falak?
[11:18] Come back right now... do you have any idea what the time is?
[11:25] I'll be back in a while... farewell.
[12:24] Will you have coffee sister?
No, thanks.
[12:29] Why are you worried?
[12:34] Sherazi... is talking about removing shares from the company as well.
[12:38] What?
[12:44] Who told you this?
[12:46] Sherazi called, he mentioned this and hung up.
[12:50] Impossible, I can't believe it. Are you sure it was Sherazi?
[12:55] What are you saying? Of course, it was Sherazi.
[12:59] I'll call and ask him...
I've tried he's not picking up.
[13:05] Secretary is calling us for the meeting.
[13:11] Sister, we have to stop him from doing this.
[13:15] Hamza has already removed his shares and we've endured a great loss.
[13:19] If Sherazi removes his shares, our business will collapse.
[13:27] This has never happened before.
[13:32] I'll talk to Sherazi and talk to him, how can he back off like this?
[13:58] He's not picking up.
[14:12] Hamza, you called me?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
[14:18] I believe that she should come to the office at least once a week.
[14:24] There's paperwork that needs to be signed. It's getting hard for me.
[14:29] Have you seen how she is... she can't even leave the house.
[14:32] And the doctor has asked us not to give her stress.
[14:36] She won't be able to do this, please manage.
[14:39] Alright, a lot of my time is wasted going from one place to another.
[14:43] Once she's there, it will help divert her mind.
[14:49] Yes, you're right. But she won't be able to do this, right now.
[14:53] Once she's mentally strong, then we'll think. Until then you have to support her.
[15:01] Alright... as you wish.
I talked to her about going to Pakistan.
[15:06] She refused to go.
I told her...
[15:10] that you and I won't leave without her. We can't leave her here alone.
[15:15] Forget it... if she doesn't want to go, then don't force her.
[15:21] My dear... in her state, we can't leave her alone.
[15:26] We need to take her back. Please... insist.
[15:31] I was thinking about getting settled here.
[15:36] When did this happen?
[15:39] You said that once your sister's waiting period is over, you'll return, that your business was suffering.
[15:45] When did you change your mind?
[15:48] I had no idea about the market here.
[15:53] When I've seen everything, I can see that there are a lot of opportunities here.
[15:57] I can progress here much quicker. What I'll gain in years in Pakistan...
[16:03] I can gain it here in months. I've thought long and hard about this decision.
[16:09] That's a productive and progressive thought.
[16:14] Both of you will have a good future. Both of you will earn in Canadian dollars.
[16:21] But, before you do anything talk to Niwal.
[16:26] You have to see how she feels. Maybe you've talked to her...
[16:32] after that, you've decided this.
No, I haven't talked to her...
[16:36] But, I will... she will do as I say...
[16:41] I'm sure that she will support me.
[16:46] Good...
[16:51] I'll go and give your sister medicine.
[16:56] Please don't put pressure on her, she's very disturbed.
[17:07] Falak.
[17:10] Falak...
[17:19] Kabir, when did you get back?
Just now.
[17:29] I had a headache and I went to sleep.
[17:34] If you don't sleep at night, you're bound to get a headache.
[17:38] Are you being sarcastic?
Not at all.
[17:42] I'm telling you the truth. You came back at one in the morning.
[17:50] I was furious, I didn't say anything because I wanted you to rest.
[17:58] I tried to come back early, but you know how Anum is.
[18:03] She's so stubborn, she kept stalling, that's why I was late.
[18:08] Falak, more than her you should be concerned about your health.
[18:12] You need to rest.
[18:16] Alright... why are you lecturing me like a mother?
[18:20] You can think of this as a lecture, or something else..
[18:23] You will not stay out for so long again.
[18:28] What's with you? Why are you putting restrictions on me?
[18:32] Falak, if you don't take care of your health...
[18:36] then I'll have to be strict.
[18:53] Do you have any idea how many days have passed since we talked?
[18:57] Three days... no sorry... it's been a week.
[19:02] And in that week, I called you so many times and you didn't reply once.
[19:09] I'm sorry... brother Raheel's business is vast, and I have to look after everything.
[19:15] I've been so busy with it.
[19:16] So busy that you can't even reply.
[19:19] One can only be so busy when one wants to rid themselves of someone.
[19:23] Or if there is someone new in their life.
[19:26] What are you saying? Don't you trust me?
[19:29] I trust you... but I'm afraid... if you're so busy now, then what will happen in the future?
[19:36] I understand your fears.
[19:38] If you understand, wind up the business and come back.
[19:42] You have a business here as well, which is suffering in your absence.
[19:47] Yes.
[19:50] Hamza... what's the matter? You look worried.
[19:55] No.. it's nothing.
Is your sister well?
[19:59] Yes... she's better than before.
[20:02] Then what? Why does it seem to me that you want to say something, but can't?
[20:09] I want to say it but now is not the time. I'll talk to you later.
[20:15] You're worrying me... tell me, what is the matter?
[20:20] It's nothing... I was just teasing you. Don't you think if were something, I would have told you?
[20:27] You scared me.
[20:30] I'll call you after a while... bye...
[20:34] Why didn't you tell her? You should have listened to her response.
[20:40] No, not now. I think if I talk to her now, she won't be able to understand.
[20:47] You already have a lot of misunderstandings in your relationships.
[20:51] If you don't communicate properly then these misunderstandings will only increase.
[20:55] Look... relationships are more important than business and money...
[20:58] it's best that you talk to her now.
[21:01] Avoid the problems that you might have.
[21:13] I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and that will never end.
[21:20] I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
[21:35] Mr. Danish... don't act like a stranger. I'll talk to Mr. Sherazi.
[21:41] Yes... he's with us, don't worry.
[21:46] Farewell
[21:50] What's the matter? All good?
[21:56] After Hamza, Sherazi has removed his shares from our company as well.
[22:03] Everyone is worried... I don't know what's happening.
[22:09] Talk to them... no one would do this without reason.
[22:13] Talk to them and find out what the reason is.
[22:20] There was a fight going on between Sherazi and Hamza...
[22:24] I didn't know that, and that is the mistake that I made.
[22:29] If we hadn't made Sherazi invest, then Hamza would have been with us today.
[22:34] Then talk to Hamza...
[22:38] Don't you think I already tried talking to him?
[22:47] He's a weird man... he doesn't care about his loss or ours.
[22:56] Greetings*
[23:01] Come sit.
[23:07] How are you?
[23:09] I'm well... how are you settling into your new home?
[23:15] Not now... but I will soon.
[23:20] I'm so sorry, I need to take this, excuse me.
[23:30] Sister... I think that he's doing all this to bother us on purpose...
[23:36] He will blackmail us and try to take advantage of our compulsion.
[23:41] I don't think so... because he knows that he won't gain anything by this
[23:49] That's why Mr. Danish is worried as well.
[23:52] it is worrying
[23:54] Where will we make up for such a loss?
[23:58] Looking at the market and our circumstances, no one would be willing to invest with us.
[24:35] Hello... is Mr. Kabir there?
Miss Falak, it's you! How are you?
[24:41] I'm fine, answer what I'm asking. Is Mr. Kabir there?
Yes, he's here.
[24:55] To tell you the truth, I can't think of anything to get us out of this.
[25:01] I've never faced such a situation before.
[25:05] Two big investors have left at once
[25:11] Anyways...
[25:13] God is our savior... don't be disappointed.
[25:17] We'll talk with Mr. Sherazi and let's see what he says...
[25:27] It's late... I think you should leave Kabir.
[25:31] Look... right now Falak needs your love and attention.
[25:38] Ups and downs occur in business, but this should not affect your home.
[25:45] Try and keep Falak happy.
[25:48] Yes, sister... I understand.
[26:07] Kabir... where were you? I've been calling you for ages. I was starving!
[26:14] There isn't anything inside the kitchen or the fridge.
[26:16] I'm so sorry... I forgot. I'll do one thing tomorrow...
[26:22] I'll buy some groceries and fruit.
[26:26] Where were you?
[26:28] Why weren't you picking up my calls?
[26:30] I went to visit sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir...
[26:34] I was starving here and you were over there talking to them.
[26:39] What's with you... I was talking to them.
[26:43] I went there to discuss some business problems.
[26:46] Kabir, what are the problems that you can't solve at the office and you have to go there at night?
[26:54] Why are you looking at me like that? I haven't asked anything wrong.
Wait a minute!
[26:58] We might have shifted here, but that doesn't mean that we have no association with that house.
[27:04] You chose to come here.
[27:06] I didn't force you to come here.
[27:09] I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and it will always stay that way.
[27:13] I can never end that relationship.
[27:18] I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
[27:25] Are you punishing me by keeping me here alone?
[27:30] It's my mistake, right? I wait for you all day so that we can eat together.
[27:37] I want to talk to you as well... but you don't have time.
[27:42] I am the wrong one... what difference does it make to you?
[27:48] Falak... listen... I'm sorry.
[27:53] I was worried... my mobile was on silent... I didn't know
[28:00] I'll try to come early tomorrow.
Leave it...
[28:06] Alright, stop being upset... let's do one thing...
[28:09] Let's have dinner at a nice place.
[28:13] Why? Did sister Aliyah not ask you for dinner?
[28:18] She asked me... but I said that I would have dinner with my wife.
[28:27] Did you eat something?
I'll get ready.
[28:46] Excuse me... tell Mr. Sherazi...
[28:50] I have, he's in a meeting and will ask for you when he comes.
[28:55] Yes, but we've been here for half an hour waiting for him. Tell him one more time.
[29:01] Okay sir, I'll tell him.
[29:09] Yes...
[29:13] Sir... Kabir and Aliyah are waiting for you, what shall I say to them?
[29:17] Let them wait... they'll leave.
Okay, sir.
[29:22] Don't send them in.
Okay.
[29:33] Sir... I've told Mr. Sherazi... he'll ask for you two when he's free.
[29:39] Okay, thank you.
[29:43] Self-respect and dignity are a thing as well.
[29:46] Let's go...
No sister.
[29:48] We'll find an investor somewhere.
[29:50] If not him, then someone else. But we can't degrade ourselves by sitting here.
[29:55] You're right, let's go.
[30:02] Falak, what's the matter? Look at the state of the home. Are you feeling well?
[30:09] I'm not... I have to do everything here. I can't do it.
[30:15] Why? Is there no maid?
[30:19] How can you work in your state?
[30:21] Kabir said that he'd find a maid in two days.
[30:24] But she isn't here! I think he's just making excuses.
[30:28] Kabir has gone insane! Is this the reason he brought you here?
[30:34] Let him come... I'll set him straight.
[30:37] Calm down, mother. I'll find someone for her, until then I'll do it.
[30:45] Don't worry my dear, we are here to care for you.
[30:51] The fight between Hamza and Sherazi has dealt us a major blow.
[30:59] I don't know why... somewhere...
[31:04] it seems to me that I'm the one responsible for this.
[31:10] Why are you holding yourself responsible?
[31:15] Because...
[31:17] trusting someone so much can cause a person to lose.
[31:22] Especially in business, one must keep eyes and ears open.
[31:29] I don't know how I missed something like this. I didn't anticipate it.
[31:39] Yes?
[31:42] Mr. Wahab is here to meet you.
[31:48] Take him to the conference room, I'll be right there.
[31:53] Sister... let me go to this meeting.
Sure.
[32:04] What will you have Mr. Wahab? Tea... coffee?
[32:08] Nothing... look, I'm busy as well as you. So better than wasting time...
[32:15] we should talk about business.
Sure, please...
[32:21] We have a very old working relationship.
[32:26] That's why I'm talking to you in a very calm manner.
[32:30] But... the check that we got from your company has bounced.
[32:37] I haven't paid the labor this month. After the check bounced if I wanted...
[32:43] I could have filed a complaint against you. But I didn't think it was appropriate.
[32:50] Thank you so much for that, and I apologize that you had to face this difficulty because of us...
[32:57] But you know there is a crisis nowadays...
I don't know anything...
[33:02] If you guys don't pay me... I'll remove all the labor that is working in your hotels.
[33:09] I have many other offers. The laborers will work where they will get paid.
[33:17] No, you have to decide.
[33:21] If you don't want this, then all dues must be cleared by the end of the month.
[33:30] You've left me no option.
[34:01] Kabir, who are you talking to? What happened?
[34:05] I'm calling Hamza.
[34:07] Why right now? You can call him in the morning.
[34:12] I'm calling him because it's something important.
[34:16] If you're tired, go to sleep. I'm worried.
[34:20] How would I know that you're worried? It won't come to me in a dream.
[34:26] You don't share anything with me... tell me what happened.
[34:29] Hamza and Sherazi have removed their shares from the company.
[34:34] We've lost millions.
Hamza has removed shares?
[34:41] He's a family member, he shouldn't have done this. Did you talk to him?
[34:46] That's the thing... he didn't care about the relationship.
[34:52] We have to suffer the consequences of the fight between Hamza and Sherazi...
[35:01] Don't worry...
[35:03] I'll talk to sister Niwal... she'll try to make him understand.
[35:06]  What can we expect from strangers if our blood does this?
[35:10] He should not be doing this to us.
[35:13] No Falak... there is no need for you to talk to Niwal.
[35:17] I don't want to involve her in this matter.
[35:22] Don't think too much about it. I'll talk to her in my way and make her understand.
[35:27] No... forget it... there's no need for you to talk to her.
[35:31] I'll manage this somehow.
[35:36] Go to sleep.
[35:55] Somewhere, I think I'm the one to blame for this.
[36:00] All this is happening because of me.
[36:12] If you trust someone more than you should... can be detrimental... especially in business.
[36:19] One should keep their eyes and ears open.
[36:42] If you guys don't pay me... I'll remove all the labor that is working in your hotels.
[37:03] Excuse me, sir... Mr. Ahsan has been waiting for you for the past hour.
[37:08] Cancel the meeting... I'm not feeling well. I'm going home.
[37:11] Sir, they provide us with spices...
[37:14] There are some problems with the rates, this meeting is important.
[37:18] Are you the boss, or I am?
[37:23] I said to cancel the meeting.
Thank you, sir.
[37:39] What is this insanity? You have a meeting with Mr. Ahsan... 
[37:43] everyone's payment has been halted for a week now.
[37:48] I won't be able to do it.. please attend the meeting...
[37:56] Look Kabir..
[37:58] In business, you have to take these kinds of stress.
[38:01] There's a crisis that doesn't mean that we should run away.
[38:05] The business is ours and we have to face everything.
[38:10] Come on... let's go for the meeting, get up.
[38:14] Did you have Mr. Wahab paid?
[38:16] Half of it is sent and the rest of it will be sent as well... don't worry.
[38:21] This month he won't bother us... we need some time to get out of this.
[38:26] One time we're out of this... we will forget the hard times we are having.
[38:36] Come on... we've already made him wait half an hour.
[39:04] What are you saying? Hamza didn't tell me anything.
[39:09] He is good friends with Kabir, why would he withdraw his shares?
[39:16] Because of Sherazi... he said that he endured a loss because of their fight.
[39:22] Because of Sherazi?
[39:28] Sister, talk to Hamza.
[39:31] Ask him not to withdraw his shares. 
[39:34] You know how hard Kabir has worked for this company
[39:38] He works day and night. He's worried.
[39:42] Will you talk to Hamza?
I will.
[39:48] You'll have to convince him. He won't ignore what you say... he loves you.
[39:56] Please sister... for me...
[39:59] Don't worry... I'll do something.
