[00:12] Enough Falak! I know the truth very well.
[00:15] Falak is right... Ask them to leave right now. 
[00:20] ask for your alimony. 
[00:22] This is not a meager sum, you can do a lot of things with that money.
[00:27] You've been divorced, at least you should gain something from this.
[00:31] And in that circumstances, the man must pay the alimony... I know the law.
[00:38] That's why I won't be pressured by you. 
[00:41] I knew it... I knew that she wouldn't be able to take care of my daughter.
[00:46] That's why I didn't want to send her away. 
[00:49] She is ungrateful.
[00:51] She doesn't care about anyone but herself.
[01:05] doctor, did you get to know that what had happened to her?
[01:08] She had food poising due to consumption of expired milk
[01:10] and the child became dehydrated due to vomiting again & again
[01:15] but don't worry, God willing everything will be under controlled
[01:18] Thank you so much
bye!
[01:25] Zakiya
[01:27] Zakiya... 
[01:32] yes maam Falak
get me a nice cup of coffee
[01:36] maam Falak, Ilham was quite unwell. Maam Nawal took her to the hospital
[01:45] what!
[01:47] why nobody told me anything?
[01:49] I was calling you but your number was off
[01:55] oh! my phone got off
[02:00] but how!
[02:10] hello sister Nawal. What happened to Ilhaam? How is she now? In which hospital you are?
[02:17] Okay, I am coming
[02:31] bring this medicine
[02:33] Okay, is the pharmacy on that side? Let me go & get them
Sure
[02:39] sister Nawal!
[02:42] Falak, where were you? I had called you so many times
[02:47] my phone got off
[02:49] aren't you feeling ashamed?
[02:50] that child was about to die because of you
[02:54] God forbid if something would have happened to her, then where we would have gone?
[02:56] You are so insensitive, you don't even know that we don't feed expired milk to the babies
[03:01] you could have at least checked the date
[03:04] it wasn't expired when I had given her. You should have checked too, you should have checked before giving it to her
[03:08] You knew it that she was not well, then why did you leave her alone?
[03:12] So what shall I do? Should I roam around while carrying her for an entire day? Shouldn't I do any of my work?
[03:16] Falak, are you mad? Do you have any idea what we are going through!
[03:20] It was difficult for us to spend a single moment
[03:23] Stop it sister! Enough of your emotional lectures. Tell me, is she fine now?
[03:26] She has become fine now, after coming here & getting her checked from the doctors
[03:30] You had created such a big scene as if God forbid.. 
[03:38] what is this guy doing here? Did you call him here?
[03:41] So, it was Kabir & I who had brought her here
[03:44] You know what this guy did to me. He did a lot of injustices with me. He had shoved me out of the house
[03:49] You are a liar! That's why you lie about every matter. Nothing as such had happened
[03:52] I don't want to see your face, Go away! And I won't let you come near to my daughter
[03:57] She is my daughter as well
[03:59] No, she is only my daughter. Only mine! And I will call the police if you won't leave from here
[04:05] Falak, are you in your senses? Why do you want to create a scene?
[04:09] its not me but he is creating a scene. Tell him to go away from here right away!
[04:12] I remember everything whenever I see him. They did a lot of injustice with me
[04:17] Enough is enough! Tell him to go from here right away
[04:19] enough of your drama
[04:21] Let me call the police because you are responsible for this condition of my daughter
[04:26] what rubbish you are talking!
This is not rubbish but reality
[04:29] I know it very well that what kind of a mother you are
you couldn't take care of my daughter
[04:34] when you used to run away from your responsibilities in front of me, then you must have done the same thing at your house as well
[04:43] neither you could become a good wife, nor a good mother
[04:46] if you knew it so well that I am so careless, then why you had sent away your daughter?
[04:50] I had already left her at your house, but then you had sent her back to me upon my mother & sister Nawal's words
[04:54] because you wanted peace & freedom in your life. But you had to make my life a living hell
[05:00] Fine!
[05:01] I will take her back with me & that too very happily
[05:04] Falak, be quiet!
[05:06] can't you both see Ilham's condition? Instead of praying for her, you guys are fighting with each other
[05:13] this guy standing in front of you is humiliating me a lot, what not he is saying about me
[05:16] if some other sister had been in your place, then she would have broken his jaw by now
[05:20] No! You are wrong Falak
[05:22] You knew it that she was not well, you shouldn't have left her alone. Now if he is scolding you then hear it quietly
[05:28] Why should I listen? Am I his slave?
[05:30] Ilham is only my daughter, he is her father
[05:33] and I want him to take away Ilham with her
[05:35] He should also get to know how difficult a child's responsibility is, He will get to know once he'll handle her
[05:40] No Falak, Kabir you won't do any such thing. Ilham will stay with us
[05:43] Why will she stay with her? If I am her mother, then he is also her father
[05:47] He should also take care of her responsibility
[05:49] he is spending his life peacefully, now he should handle his child too
[05:52] And yes! Before taking Ilham give me my alimony, then you can take away your daughter
[05:58] be quiet, have you gone mad? Why are you escalating the matter?
[06:01] sister, you won't understand. Stay away from these issues. I know these people very well
[06:05] you have shown your status!
[06:07] this is your reality
[06:11] Fine! You will get your alimony & I will take away my daughter
[06:16] Fine, you can take away your daughter then. I have no objection
[06:20] Falak, you cannot do this
[06:23] but remember one thing
[06:26] I will not let you see my daughter's face, you will swerve for it
[06:30] time will tell that
[06:33] for now you'll get to know in a few days that its not an easy task to handle the kids
[06:49] I have become fed-up of all this
[06:50] just relax
[06:52] Falak, you are such a selfish & insensitive girl!
[06:58] what wrong have I done?
[07:00] if I want to do something in my life, then what problem do you have?
[07:04] and why shall I take care of Kabir's daughter?
[07:07] what do you want?
[07:08] entire life I shall do her brought up & help her grow. And there he shall wander around freely and do whatever he wants to
[07:13] and then whether he remarries
[07:17] I am sorry! Why don't I deserve such a life?
[07:21] I will do whatever I want to do
[07:23] don't I have a right to live my life as per my choice?
[07:26] Falak, I can't believe. How can I be so mistaken to recognize you
[07:33] this is my life & whatever decisions I need to make whatever is better for me. I will do that
[07:39] did you hear her? you are her biggest supporter
[07:45] what wrong did she said? She is right
[07:48] She is not only his child, but Kabir's too. She is Kabir's responsibility as well
[07:52] So let him handle his responsibility
[07:55] and by the way, why are you taking tension?
[07:58] Hamza, you are supporting her?
[08:01] No... I am not supporting her
[08:04] I am supporting whatever is right
[08:07] You are doing so wrong. You are showing her the wrong path
[08:11] its not a wrong thing to spend your life as per your own choice
[08:15] and what are you doing? She is your sister, you should be supporting her
[08:19] No! absolutely not. I am not so insensitive, I cannot support all this
[08:30] did you see? She always do this to me
[08:34] She never understands me, she is only concerned about Kabir
[08:38] and nobody cares about me
[08:44] don't you worry, you haven't done anything wrong with anyone
[08:48] I am with you
[08:53] thank you so much Hamza, don't know what would have happened if you hadn't been there
[09:17] what do you want?
[09:18] entire life I shall do her brought up & help her grow. And there he shall wander around freely
[09:23]  and do whatever he wants to
and then whether he remarries
[09:25] I am sorry! Why don't I deserve such a life?
[09:32] Nawal, take care of Ilhaam
[09:37] make her like you
[10:14] Nawal
[10:22] Hamza you!
[10:25] yes... come with me
[10:29] Nawal, let me talk to him
[10:31] Kabir, please... 
[10:34] speak up
[10:35] you will come with me right away, you won't stay here for a minute
No!
[10:40] people are watching, don't create a scene Hamza
[10:43] I don't care!
[10:45] you will give the resignation right away, and you will not go to his office again. Come with me
[11:05] Hamza, what do you think? Am I a puppet?
[11:08] that I will do whatever you will ask me to do?
[11:10] Yes! do you have any other choice? You are my to-be wife
[11:16] So, I won't tolerate that you shall do the job in my enemy's office
[11:20] I am your to-be wife, but not your wife as of yet
[11:23] if I want, I can end this relation right away
[11:27] really?
[11:29] then end it. Let me see, how you'll do it
[11:56] Let me end that relation due to which you show so much of attitude to me
[12:04] today onwards our paths are separate
[12:08] listen!
[12:13] you have no right to end this relation
[12:18] this relation can end only if I want to
[12:24] and today on wards, don't you dare to take off this ring
[12:35] I love you a lot
[12:37] therefore I am explaining you with love
[12:40] do as I am asking you to do
[12:42] leave my hand
[12:45] its hurting
[12:47] people are watching, don't make a scene. Let me go!
[12:50] remember one thing
[12:54] today onwards never talk about getting separated from me
[13:09] you can be a good businessman
[13:12] but you are not a good human being
[13:14] Really?
[13:16] now you will tell me what I am?
[13:18] and do you think that I will give any importance to your words?
[13:21] You have no importance of any relation or anyone's respect
[14:22] you have no right to end this relation
[14:25] this relation can end only if I want to
[14:36] and today on wards, don't you dare to take off this ring
[14:45] remember one thing
[14:47] today onwards never talk about getting separated from me
[15:05] are you back?
[15:06] yes my dear wife, how are you?
[15:08] you came quite late today, is everything alright?
[15:11] I had told you that I am doing an investment with a friend in Germany
[15:16] So there were a few meeting about it & I was busy 
[15:19] how was the meeting?
[15:20] very nice & the response was quite over whelming
[15:23] I had no idea that there is so much of leather demand in Germany, I was surprised!
[15:29] just pray whatever happens shall be good. And everything happens smoothly
[15:34] all of my prayers are with you. God willing all will be good
Amen
[15:38] where is my daughter?
[15:40] Right now she is doing her study time, she has said that I will become an astronaut
[15:45] that's great!
[15:47] if this my daughter's desire, then her father will ensure to make her an astronaut
[15:52] She will become an astronaut. Go freshen up, meanwhile let me serve the dinner
[15:56] Okay, do call Kabir as well
[15:58] Tell him to come, lets have dinner together
Okay, let me call him
[16:15] today onwards our paths are separate
[16:30] you will give the resignation right away, and you will not go to his office again. Come with me
[16:36] Hamza, you can't do this!
[16:42] I love you a lot
therefore I am explaining you with love
[16:46] do as I am asking you to do
[17:38] he is calling to apologize, because he must have realized it now
[17:42] I don't need his apologies. Neither I will meet him nor I will forgive him
[17:56] you aren't doing the right thing with me
[17:58] what do you think? Will I back out if you will not attend the phone or talk to me?
[18:04] Absolutely not! Its your delusion, Nawal
You have to talk to me
[18:10] because your every path comes to me
[18:21] Kabir, keep this
[18:23] what is this, brother?
[18:25] cheque of 50 lacs
[18:29] for Falak's alimony, give it to her
[18:37] but brother you were saying that its quite difficult to arrange
[18:40] Its alright, I have managed it
[18:45] thank you so much brother, you have solved such a big problem of mine
[18:49] its alright, it not a big deal
[18:52] in fact do one thing, do take the receiving from her on the stamp paper. 
[18:57] What if tomorrow she claims it again
[18:59] in fact I must say, you should also get Ilham's custody papers signed from her
[19:03] So that she cannot go to the court in the future & we don't face any problem
[19:10] Thank you so much
[19:11] oho, its fine..
stop it, its not a big deal
[19:21] So, are you happy now? If I hadn't been there, then you would have never got this idea
[19:28] by the way, you would have stayed empty hands
[19:30] some days ago you were empty hands, and now look you have a cheque of 50 lacs in your hands
[19:34] thanks to me
[19:36] you are absolutely correct
[19:39] Its true, if you hadn't put this in my mind then I would have never claimed for it
[19:44] it was right & one should never leave their right
[19:48] By the way Falak, you are so lucky that your problem got solved quite early
[19:54] otherwise it takes months...
[20:00] I am quite lucky though
[20:02] So what have you decided now? What will you do?
[20:05] I haven't decided anything as of yet. You tell me, what shall I do?
[20:09] Falak, do you trust me?
[20:14] right now its just you, on whom I can blindly trust
[20:23] I know a producer, and he wants to produce his own film
[20:27] if you want, you can produce a film along with him
[20:32] also you'll be the heroine in it
[20:36] Falak, just think... you'll come on the silver screen
[20:41] cameras all around, lighting... and you'll be standing in the center like a heroine
[20:49] everyone will be adoring you
[20:54] are you sure? Is this possible?
[20:56] why its not possible? just think... 
[20:59] first project on the big screen, and that too as a heroine
[21:04] I am 100% sure that the film will touch the skies
[21:10] and after that, all the big projects will want to caste you only
[21:14] and all the upcoming next years will be yours
[21:19] Maria, is this all a dream?
[21:22] for now its a dream, but it can be true if you take the risk
[21:28] Falak look, one needs to take the risk in order to become successful
[21:34] Alright then, I am ready
[21:37] this is great!
[21:38] Falak, I can see your bright future in front of my eyes
[21:42] all the heroines will become flop in front of you & you will be the superstar
[21:50] please take something...
[22:00] but right now I don't have anymore money, also the accounts are empty
[22:05] Falak, you had told me that aunty has transferred half of the property on your name
[22:11] I cannot let you ruin such a huge amount
[22:14] but you cannot stop me, I have a legal right on everything
[23:38] Yes?
[23:39] Nawal, I wanted to discuss something. 
I wanted to talk about whatever happened in the room
[23:46] whatever Hamza did was not right
[23:49] it was so embarrassing for me. 
Kabir & I, both have to face a lot of embarrassment
[23:57] you are absolutely correct. Whatever happened yesterday wasn't right at all
[24:02] Yes, but you don't have to be embarrassed for it. Hamza should be embarrassed for it
[24:08] the way he had dragged you out of the conference while holding your hand forcefully, & that too in front of everyone
[24:14] Nawal, what is the use of such relations when we don't have respect in them
[24:21] You should talk to Hamza, if he cannot respect you then...
[24:28] Nawal, when it comes on one's respect then staying quiet is harmful
[24:34] you are right
[24:37] Please.. never consider yourself weak. You are so brave
[24:44] and never compromise on your self-respect. Please
[24:50] and remember you are not alone. Ok?
[24:56] Thank you, Aliya
[25:02] Zakiya
[25:05] yes maam Nawal
[25:07] I am going to my room to do rest. No matter who comes, just say that I am not at home
[25:12] Okay
[25:17] Hello! yes, how is your mom's health?
[25:21] No, no... don't worry. God willing, soon she will be fine
[25:25] hmm....
[25:27] No no, don't worry. I will handle
[25:30] I am telling you, its not a problem
[25:34] Just take care of your mother, stay with her. She needs you more
[25:39] I am telling you, I will go
[25:42] just worry about your mother, ok?
[25:45] yes, let me tell them for the ticket
[25:47] Okay, bye! take care...
[25:54] yes sir?
[25:58] tell Nawal that Hamza is here
[26:01] but she is not at home
[26:10] but her car is parked
[26:25] Fine!
[26:46] Thank God you came on the right time. We are going to Nawal's house, come along
[26:50] nobody will go to Nawal's house
[26:52] why?
[26:52] As I said, neither you or sister will go to meet Nawal
[26:58] but why? has something happened? what's the problem?
[27:01] She has gone crazy!
[27:05] and now me too!
[27:07] Hamza! at least listen to me
[27:16] Hamza, what happened?
[27:20] why are you so angry?
[27:21] Sister please! I don't want to talk on this topic at all. Leave me alone
[27:26] but... 
As I said, please!
[27:53] what happen? Did he tell you something?
[27:55] No mom
[27:58] I don't understand what fight have happened in between both of them
[28:03] mom, don't worry Ok? 
Trust me, everything will be fine
[28:09] I hope so
[28:12] brother... what is the matter? Is everything alright?
[28:16] yes, all good... actually I want to discuss something with both of you
[28:20] what happen, is everything alright?
[28:22] yes, all good...
[28:25] I had told you both that me & my business partner Farhan are doing an investment in Germany
[28:30] yes...
[28:31] So, we had to visit Germany for the same
[28:34] initially the plan was that Farhan will go to Germany, but unfortunately he had an emergency
[28:40] his mother got a heart attack
[28:42] Oh... 
so now I am going in his place
[28:45] oho! this is very sad news. By the way, how is his mother doing now?
[28:49] Thanks to God she is much better than before
[28:51] in fact he was saying that he'll go after a few days but I said no, you should stay here with your mother & take care of her
[28:58] I will go, after all its my responsibility too
[29:01] its a good thing. By the way, approximately how many days tour it would be?
[29:06] nothing is confirmed as of yet, it will take some time
[29:09] all depends upon the meeting over there
[29:12] by the way brother the leather market is so good in Germany. I think your decision is absolutely correct
[29:18] and God willing, soon your company will grow very quickly
[29:21] God willing
[29:23] by the way, when do you have to go?
[29:27] the ticket will be of this week, I have told him
[29:30] by the way Kabir, have you paid the alimony's amount to Falak?
[29:36] yes brother, I have
[29:37] and what about Ilham's custody papers? 
Have you got them signed?
[29:42] yes sister, I have got that done too
[29:45] its a good thing, at least she won't be able to claim the custody of the baby
[29:50] hmm...
[29:55] here you go
[30:00] Falak, this much amount won't be enough
[30:05] we would be needing an extra 5 to 6 crores
[30:08] for now I have only this much amount. Kindly talk to Mr. Shuja, he can arrange the rest of the amount
[30:13] Falak look, the film shooting is in Switzerland. Film's production, post-production & marketing
[30:20] the total would be almost 10 to 12 crores
[30:24] See, you will give half of the money & Mr. Shuja will add half of the money
[30:33] but right now I don't have anymore money, also the accounts are empty
[30:37] Falak, you had told me that aunty has transferred half of the property on your name
[30:45] Yes
[30:46] then sell your share
[30:49] As it is, after the movie you'll live in this small house
[30:53] You have to buy a big house in some posh area
[30:56] house...
[31:00] sister Nawal will never agree to sell this house
[31:03] what's the big deal if sister Nawal will not agree? Why are you worried for her?
[31:07] has she ever been worried for you till date? No, right?
[31:10] then please you also don't worry about her. 
Its done that you are selling this house
[31:15] be a businesswoman baby, how will it work if you don't take the risk?
[31:22] Falak, what are you thinking?
[31:27] See, if you don't want to work then tell me. Take back your cheque
[31:30] No...
[31:32] See, as it is if not you then someone else. Already Mr. Shuja has so many people who wants to work with him
[31:40] I can understand Maria, I will arrange the rest of the money as well. Don't worry!
[31:45] for now, keep it
[32:00] hmm....
[32:02] I will try to come in a few days
[32:04] Okay
[32:07] what happen, Hamza? Whose call it was?
[32:10] it was the company manager's call from Canada
[32:13] actually...
[32:18] brother Raheel's cousin Qasim have sent a legal notice
[32:21] Qasim had sent a legal notice! but why?
[32:26] because I have separated him completely from the company's affairs
[32:30] Also, I have canceled all the contracts from his company
[32:34] but you didn't tell us anything. Qasim is a nice guy, why you did this with him?
[32:41] Because their performance wasn't good. What else I could have done?
[32:45] I didn't had any other option
[32:50] so what will happen now?
[32:53] now I have to go to Canada, to answer the notice
[32:58] rest we'll get to know after going there, eventually all of this will take time
[33:16] Falak, this much amount won't be enough
we would be needing an extra 5 to 6 crores
[33:21] the film shooting is in Switzerland. Film's production, post-production & marketing
[33:26] the total would be almost 10 to 12 crores
[33:29] See, you will give half of the money & Mr. Shuja will add half of the money
[33:33]  sell your share
As it is, after the movie you'll live in this small house
[33:42] what's the big deal if sister Nawal will not agree? Why are you worried for her?
[33:46] has she ever been worried for you till date?
[33:48] then please you also don't worry about her. 
Its done that you are selling this house
[33:52] be a businesswoman baby, how will it work if you don't take the risk?
[34:43] I want to talk to you
[34:46] go ahead
[34:50] I want to buy a car, also I need some money
[34:53] how much money do you want?
[34:55] you cannot give me
[34:57] that's why I have decided to sell out my share of this house
[35:05] what!
[35:08] how could you even think of it?
[35:10] I will not let you sell this house, Falak
[35:14] I haven't come to ask you but to tell you, I have already decided
[35:19] rest is your choice, if you don't want to sell this house then sell the plot & give me the money
[35:23] are you in your senses? Do you even know the value of that plot?
[35:26] it must be 4 to 5 crores, and I require the same amount
[35:29] why do you need so much of money?
[35:31] I want to do a business
[35:32] Besides, I cannot sit idle at home. I have an entire left, somehow have to do something
[35:40] and what business do you want to do?
[35:42] I don't find it important to tell you everything
[35:46] absolutely not!
[35:48] I cannot let you ruin such a huge amount
[35:51] but you cannot stop me, I have a legal right on everything
[35:57] rest is your choice, whether you want to sell the plot or I shall sell my share from this house
[36:04] Hello! yes Maria?
[36:29] my dear wife, what is the need to keep so many clothes?
[36:34] I had checked the weather, its quite cold over there. So I thought of keeping a few more clothes
[36:41] Aliya, I will get a few from the market if required
[36:46] You will not reach the market as soon as you land there
[36:50] point!
[36:52] now get ready, its time for your flight
[36:56] Ok give me 5 minutes. And yes, ensure to keep my shaving stuff
[37:01] I've already kept your shaving kit, don't worry!
[37:03] Thank you!
[37:05] Ilhaam baby is looking so cute, also your health looks fine
[37:10] now don't get sick, otherwise dad will get upset
[37:14] Okay?
[37:16] are you hungry?
[37:17] hey! when did you come? 
Are you happy now, that you father is here?
[37:21] I was only missing her when I was at the office
[37:28] Sister, I cant forget that moment when she was hospitalized
[37:33] they were putting injections & drips on her small hands
[37:39] if it was in my control, I would have done something as such to get her entire pain. But nothing shall happen to her
[37:47] I wish Falak would have realized the same, then it would have been really good
[37:52] Sister, promise me one thing today
[37:56] today on wards, you will never mention Falak in this house
[38:01] just consider that Falak is dead for us
[38:06] tell me yourself
[38:08] is she capable enough to be missed?
[38:12] I can understand
[38:16] dad's dearest daughter...
[38:20] Nawal...
[38:22] what is happening between you & Hamza?
[38:25] what fight is going on?
[38:31] how will we get to know until you don't tell us?
[38:34] I won't hide anything from both of you
[38:36] actually the matter is that Hamza's behavior is quite changed with me
[38:40] He isn't the same Hamza whom I used to know
[38:42] He had tarnished my self-respect so many times in the past few days
[38:47] He had misbehaved with me in the office & few days ago he had crossed all the limits
[38:51] I was in a conference, he dragged me outside the room while holding my hand
[38:56] a lot of people were present there
[38:59] but he doesn't have any respect in his eyes for me, He treats me like a slave
[39:06] Dear, we have been talking so many times but why you had never mentioned it to me?
[39:12] I would have explained him for you
[39:15] Aunty, I have decided & have announced my decision to Hamza
[39:21] I cannot marry Hamza
