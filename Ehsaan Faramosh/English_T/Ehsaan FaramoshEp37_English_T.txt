[00:13] What the two of them were mentioning about me...
[00:17] the very same things they've said to me about you.
[00:25] Doctor, I've told you my entire situation.
[00:29] I cannot afford this baby. Please try to understand.
[00:34] I'm embarrassed at what I said.
[00:39] But you need to make Falak understand as well. She overreacts over the smallest of things.
[00:45] She makes mountains out of molehills.
[00:48] Every husband and wife must make compromises.
[00:52] Falak doesn't compromise over a single thing.
[01:04] I cannot tell you how embarrassed I was in front of sister Aliyah and brother Toqeer
[01:11] Kabir, when you didn't like her going into this profession, then why did you permit her?
[01:17] You should have refused from the beginning.
[01:22] Auntie, if I say something to you right now you'll think that I'm being harsh.
[01:27] No tell me
[01:28] I don't like Falak working in this profession. I don't like her working in modeling.
[01:36] I told Falak that if she wanted to do a job, then to find one in a good company.
[01:41] Why any other company? Why not mine?
[01:45] She should work in our company, that way I'll have support as well.
[01:49] What could have been better than that? But Falak didn't tell me about it.
[01:57] Ask Falak why she didn't tell you this. She has one more habit...
[02:05] she hides things, or she lies.
[02:11] And auntie, I didn't come here to talk about her lies.
[02:15] But make her understand that one has to make compromises in life...
[02:22] Alright my dear, don't worry. I'll talk to Falak and make her understand.
[02:31] Thank you so much. I was hopeful that you would understand me.
[02:36] You're most welcome.
[02:40] Allow me to leave, I have an important meeting and I have to be there...
[02:45] Farewell*
[02:52] You guys came to me for an investment. Isn't it like that miss Aliyah?
[02:57] It is like that. I was the one who asked you.
[03:00] When I invested as per your conditions... you are side-lining me?
[03:07] That's unfortunate.
[03:09] If there was a problem, I would have preferred that you would have told me then.
[03:13] Planning against me like this... and side-lining me...
[03:17] Creating propaganda against me is against the very nature of the man I am.
[03:22] Something I cannot tolerate.
[03:25] This is bad manners.
[03:28] It's unethical.
[03:30] What about what you're doing...
[03:33] Is that not bad manners?
[03:36] We were trying to solve the problem there.
[03:40] And you stepped in the middle at the last moment and made the matter worse.
[03:46] We have millions invested with Hamza
[03:49] and one of your lies has dragged us back from where we started.
[03:54] Because of you, we can endure a major loss.
[03:59] Everything is fair in business and war.
[04:04] At that moment you did what you thought was right... and I did...
[04:09] what I thought was right.
[04:12] Besides, I only mentioned a few things. If Hamza was a mature businessman...
[04:18] then would he have listened to me?
[04:22] No... he's not a mature businessman.
[04:27] Hamza is an emotional and foolish man. That's why he keeps enduring losses.
[04:33] I'm disappointed... we cannot move forward like this.
[04:38] You cannot talk about our company members like this.
[04:43] If you have a problem with him, then that's your personal matter.
[04:47] Do not include these matters in our business.
[04:52] If you had said that to Hamza then that would have been for the best.
[04:57] You don't want to hear a single thing against him. Back then you were giving all the favors.
[05:03] Mr. Shirazi... I was trying to make Hamza understand at that time...
[05:09] Oh really?
[05:10] From what I heard it didn't seem to me that you were trying to make Hamza understand anything.
[05:16] This is just the beginning Mr. Shirazi... if you employ such an attitude from the beginning...
[05:23] then I'm sorry I will have to raise this question in the next board meetings.
[05:29] I will have to request them to take your shares back from you.
[05:34] You will not do anything like that.
[05:36] Right now your position is very weak.
[05:40] Hamza has refused to work with you as well.
[05:46] And if I leave you as well... and if there are a few press releases...
[05:52] then do you know what might happen?
[05:56] Both of you are very smart, I'm sure you don't want to endure a loss.
[06:10] What happened mother, did you call me?
[06:18] Why are you two sitting here so seriously?
It's nothing.
[06:22] Come sit... we need to talk to you.
[06:30] Is everything alright?
What have you decided Falak?
[06:36] About what?
[06:40] Kabir came home today...
[06:43] She apologized to mother and told her that he was ashamed of what he said.
[06:49] This shame is nothing compared to what they did to me.
[06:55] You wouldn't believe me how sister Aliyah humiliated me, even if I told you.
[07:01] Kabir told mother that he forbade her to work in show business.
[07:06] That's why the fight occurred, but you said he allowed you.
[07:13] I'm a human being with desires and a life.
[07:18] Can't I do anything of my own choice?
[07:24] I told you that Kabir didn't have any objections in the past,
[07:29] but now that sister Aliyah has filled his ears, he has started to object.
[07:33] Whatever it may be, do not work until the delivery.
[07:38] He's saying that because he loves you and because he's worried about the child.
[07:42] Look, my dear... there are a lot of ups and downs that occur at home...
[07:47] You should endure some as well.
What more shall I endure?
[07:55] Ever since I've come here I call Kabir daily, but he doesn't answer.
[08:01] I now understand that no matter how hard I want to save this relationship, Kabir doesn't want to. He's backing off.
[08:08] Until Kabir and I stay in that house things will never be good between us.
[08:13] That's why I've decided one thing as well...
[08:17] What decision?
[08:21] I will not go back into that house.
[08:26] What do you mean by that?
[08:29] If Kabir wants to take me back, then he should buy me another home.
[08:41] Mr. Shirazi, I called a board meeting, but we were unable to do that because of some reason.
[08:50] Next time we will make you a board member.
[08:55] Please, forget about what happened. Sister and I are trying to calm down Hamza.
[09:01] One more thing... we never intended to take your shares back from you.
[09:09] I have no interest in becoming a board member.
[09:12] Nor do I have enough time.
[09:15] My focus is my business.
[09:18] I don't want you to disturb me and I don't want to disturb you.
[09:27] My offer still stands... I'm ready to buy all of Hamza's shares.
[09:33] That too at double the price.
[09:37] Alongside that, I'll return the investment Hamza has made.
[09:46] Mr. Shirazi... we cannot make a decision immediately, we'll need time.
[09:52] In fact, we will talk to our board members and discuss this with them.
[09:56] We'll let you know. Thanks for the offer.
[10:00] Miss Aliyah... Kabir is smarter than you.
[10:18] It's not wrong of me to demand a separate house, it's my right.
[10:22] What haven't I endured in that house?
I've endured sister Aliyah's taunts...
[10:27] I'm tired now, I cannot tolerate this anymore.
[10:31] Kabir wants me to follow sister Aliyah as he does.
[10:35] Does he want me to spend my life like a puppet?
[10:38] My dear, we don't want that?
Alright, then mother...
[10:42] Don't force me back into that house. I will not go there again.
[11:13] This is Shirazi speaking...
[11:16] In all of the newspapers tomorrow morning, there should be a new published...
[11:23] Publish that there is a fight between Hamza and Kabir foods.
[11:29] Also, add that both of them want to go their separate ways.
[11:39] These are the files of all the shares Mr. Raheel has in different companies.
[11:45] Take a look at it.
[11:49] These are a few factory papers. Some belong to houses, plots, and apartments...
[11:54] Where Mr. Raheel has invested.
Look...
[11:58] you can take a look at them yourself...
[11:59] I'm not in a state to look at them.
[12:05] Mr. Raheel has made you his successor for his inheritance.
[12:10] His relatives are threatening me with filing a case.
[12:14] I'm telling you all this so that you know...
[12:20] This is nothing to worry about. My son Hamza will be here in a few days and he will take a look at this.
[12:25] He is the one who will talk to you.
[12:27] Alright. I talked to Hamza, he said that he'll come within the week.
[12:32] Miss Nazish, you should know of this, because if this isn't resolved outside court, then we'll need you.
[12:41] There's nothing to worry about, we'll handle it... don't worry.
[12:47] Leave these files here, she'll take a look at them.
Sure.
[12:53] Allow me to leave... call me when Hamza comes back.
[12:57] Sure... I'll see you off.
[12:59] I'll be right back dear.
[13:11] Hello, Falak... did you go to the doctor? What did she say?
[13:17] She refused... she's saying that there is a risk.
[13:21] A lot of time has passed and now nothing can happen.
[13:25] If an abortion is conducted, it could put my life in danger.
[13:31] Maria, why are you silent? Say something...
[13:33] What should I say? You've put me in a position where I can't say anything.
[13:39] Forget about the movie, you won't be able to do it in your state.
[13:44] You cannot sign up for the drama as well.
[13:47] What are you saying?
[13:49] I told you to take your career seriously, but you didn't listen to me. Family comes later.
[13:57] What else should I do? You've put me in a difficult spot.
[14:01] You're the one who put me in a difficult spot.
[14:04] Do you know how hard it is to face all this?
[14:07] Do you have any idea the loss I'll endure because of your foolishness?
[14:13] Falak... if I had known that you were pregnant, I would never have launched you.
[14:18] Falak, do you have any idea how upset you've made me?
[14:21] You've destroyed your career with your own hands.
[14:27] This pregnancy has put a full stop on your career before it even got started.
[14:32] For God's sake Maria... don't say this.
[14:35] Don't worry me...
You're the one who is worrying me.
[14:41] If I had worked so hard on someone else.
Enough... I didn't call you...
[14:46] to taunt me... provide me a solution for this.
[14:50] Come by the office and we'll talk there. Bye!
[15:28] Thank you.
[15:30] This moment is so beautiful, right? I'll be sad once you leave.
[15:36] If only you weren't going.
[15:40] Again with that sadness.
I have every right to be sad.
[15:47] If it weren't important, I would never have gone.
[15:53] Mother called me today... she asked for my presence immediately.
[15:58] Brother Raheel's business has endured major losses.
[16:03] I fear that it won't take much time.
What do you mean?
[16:08] Meaning... it can take more than three or four months. I'm just being careful.
[16:14] Please don't scare me...
[16:16] It was hard for me to convince myself. I told myself that it was only four months...
[16:20] If you take more time than that, then I'll die.
[16:25] I swear I'm very worried. But what can I do?
[16:29] It's a widespread business and it takes time to wind up.
[16:33] I will try my best to wind up everything quickly and come back to you.
[16:41] I promise you that as soon as this time passes...
[16:46] I will give you so much love that will make you forget everything.
[16:52] I will take care of you so much...
[16:55] you will wonder if we ever had any problems to begin with.
[17:02] I swear... after we get married I won't let any tears come to your eyes.
[17:12] Stop crying... everyone is crying.
[17:49] Falak...
[17:51] What happened? Why are you like this?
[17:56] Really? I'm crying over my fate.
[17:59] What happened, tell me about it.
[18:04] I was offered a film, but I refused.
[18:09] Because of my pregnancy.
[18:12] My dear sister, what is there to be so worried about?
[18:16] You did what you thought was right. Focus on your health and take care of yourself.
[18:23] Once you get done with this, you can focus on your career.
[18:28] Did you talk to Kabir?
[18:30] No... I called him all day, but he didn't pick up.
[18:34] I don't know why he's doing this.
[18:37] How can I make him understand that for any girl, her first priority is her family?
[18:43] I've left working on films... but he doesn't believe me.
[18:48] If you try affectionately, then he'll believe you.
[18:53] There's no point... the distance between us keeps growing.
[18:59] Sister Aliyah will never let us be happy. She can't stand to see us happy.
[19:05] The last few weeks were hell for me in that home.
[19:11] She's a lying woman... one doesn't even do what she did to me, to an enemy.
[19:20] She doesn't seem like that.
[19:25] She appears to be such a sweet person.
[19:33] That is what she shows... I know her real face.
[19:38] She acts sweet in front of everyone. But when we're alone she only spews poison at me.
[19:50] Do you think I'm lying? Like Kabir, do you think that whatever I say regarding sister Aliyah, is a lie?
[19:58] I'm not saying that you're lying. I know that you've faced a lot.
[20:05] Sometimes... one can't seem to accept the truth.
[20:11] I pray that God shows you the day...
[20:14] when you see that woman's real face. Like it dawned on me.
[20:20] At least then you won't think that I lie to you all.
[20:24] I'll talk to mother, I'll ask her to talk to Kabir and Aliyah.
[20:32] You will not have to endure anything now.
[20:36] Rest up... go to sleep... it's late.
[21:02] Look... miss Sultana... you have a misunderstanding...
[21:06] Talk to Falak... we've never done anything wrong with her at her home.
[21:10] Falak... please tell her.
[21:25] Sister... if we take a look at it Mr. Shirazi's proposal is very attractive.
[21:30] But there is a problem... Mr. Shirazi and Hamza cannot see eye to eye.
[21:37] In their fight with each other...
[21:40] I don't want our company to endure a loss.
[21:44] Shirazi cannot be as loyal as Hamza is to us.
[21:49] Hamza trusts us blindly and you've seen how Shirazi is.
[21:55] That's why I want us to distance a man like Shirazi away from our business.
[22:06] You're right.
[22:10] Did you talk to Hamza about this?
[22:15] No... I haven't... but I'll talk to him... don't worry.
[22:19] I'll take a look at a few things... I'll get back to you... but send it to me.
[22:30] Send a coffee.
[22:54] What did I tell you? This man cannot be trusted.
[22:59] What happened?
Read it for yourself.
[23:05] No one can do this vile thing other than Shirazi.
[23:09] I'm sure he had this news published.
[23:13] This was what I was talking about. He's forcing us to take him up on his offer.
[23:19] And I won't let that happen.
[23:28] This man is smarter than we think.
[24:33] What's the matter? Are you worried?
[24:37] What troubles can I have apart from the business?
[24:45] Why are you looking at me like that?
[24:48] I see that is the thing you should be worried about...
[24:53] you're not worried about that at all.
[24:56] I don't understand what you're talking about...
[25:00] I'm talking about Kabir...
Aliyah, Falak is upset and she's at her home.
[25:05] Can't you see Kabir's worries?
There is no end to business...
[25:14] and life problems...
[25:17] Try focusing on him as well.
[25:22] You're saying that like you're the only one who cares about him and I'm only concerned with our business.
[25:30] He's my only brother, who will worry about him, if not me?
[25:38] Alright then... I'll visit Falak, you should come with me as well.
[25:44] We'll bring Falak back... Kabir will be happy...
[25:49] and your worries will end as well.
Done.
[25:53] I'll come back early from work tomorrow and then we'll visit Falak.
Alright.
[26:00] Shall I ask tea to be made?
Yes, but ask for it to be served here.
[26:05] Falak isn't lying... I'm sure we were wrong to judge Aliyah.
[26:12] Falak endured all this and she didn't let us know.
[26:17] She thought if she remained silent, everything would fix itself.
[26:21] One doesn't realize that one's suffocating until one starts drowning.
[26:26] She endured for as long as she could.
[26:29] Now her patience has ended and what option does she have apart from telling us?
[26:34] Talk to her in-laws... besides her demand is not wrong.
[26:39] She wants to live alone with her husband and that is every girl's right.
[26:47] You're right...
[26:48] besides Kabir can afford another house. Now whether we talk to them, or they talk to us...
[26:54] You have to talk about one thing and that is to provide Falak with a separate home.
[26:58] Forget it mother.
[27:01] Kabir will never agree to it.
Why not?
[27:06] If he wants to spend his life with you, he will have to do this.
[27:12] Why don't you understand... sister Aliyah will provoke him even more.
[27:17] I won't have a separate home, on top of that my life would become hell.
[27:21] I've promised you Falak...
[27:23] I will let there be any more injustice imposed on you. You've endured enough!
[27:31] Mother... they think that no injustice has occurred to me.
[27:35] Forget it... drop me home in a few days...
[27:41] I will accept that this is my fate.
[27:48] What kind of things are you saying Falak?
[27:50] Sister, I don't want to worry you or mother.
[28:06] Falak... Falak...
[28:18] Sister, are you guys going somewhere?
[28:21] Yes... we're going to take care of something important.
[28:24] Is it an official dinner?
[28:26] No, it's a surprise... I'll tell you when I get back... Tawqir come on, we're running late.
[28:35] You're late... hurry up.
[28:38] We'll meet when we come back... farewell.
[28:44] What surprise could it be?
[28:52] Falak... you've only consulted a single gynecologist.
[28:56] I think you should have a second opinion
[28:58] I have two good friends who are gynecologists, should I talk to them?
[29:07] No Maria, leave it... I don't want to take a risk. Besides, it's only for a few months...
[29:18] I need your help. Please support me.
[29:23] Alright... Falak the movie is gone... let's just complete the ads that we've signed.
[29:34] Do you understand?
[29:38] I do...
Falak, I'll help you, but you'll have to promise...
[29:44] that you shouldn't let your figure loose.
[29:46] I don't want you to stop focusing on yourself after you have the baby.
[29:52] Like you are now. I want the same look you have now.
[29:55] If this changes, no matter how hard I try, no one will cast you.
[30:00] No... I promise I'll take care of you. I love this career.
Good.
[30:08] I'll talk to the production houses to shoot the pending shoots within the month.
[30:16] What do you mean? All of the ads inside a month?
[30:20] Yes... you'll put on weight in a month...
[30:26] Besides, I'm trying to save your career.
[30:30] If you think this is hard then leave this and sit at home.
[30:34] I don't have a problem with that. I'll find a new girl within a week.
[30:39] Don't be upset... I'll manage. Tell me the dates and I'll join you.
[30:47] Good... that's the spirit I want.
[30:58] We apologize for coming here unannounced.
[31:01] I asked Tawqir to call before we arrive...
[31:05] He said that there wasn't any need. 
[31:07] He said that we'd come here and take our daughter-in-law back.
[31:21] Falak, how are you?
[31:31] Why didn't Kabir come along?
[31:34] No... he doesn't know that we're here. Tawqir wanted to surprise Kabir...
[31:42] We came here without telling him.
[31:47] Sister...
[31:49] Where are you going? Please sit here.
[31:57] Falak has been here for a while and we're here to take her back.
[32:02] Please end whatever conflict there is Falak.
[32:07] Besides... girls shouldn't be at their parent's home, they should be...
[32:11] with her husband.
Exactly...please send Falak with us.
[32:17] Aliyah has organized a small party for Falak... so please...
[32:25] Mother and I wanted to visit you.
[32:32] Before we send Falak back to you, we need to clear our a few things...
[32:44] Sure, what is it?
[32:49] I cannot send Falak with you guys.
[32:55] Why? Why not? 
[32:59] Whatever Kabir said was out of anger and for that Aliyah and I apologize.
[33:03] We've come here with a lot of hope of bringing Falak back.
[33:09] If you want to take Falak back with you, then ask Kabir to buy a separate home for her.
[33:25] I will not send Falak back to that home again.
[33:29] My daughter isn't a burden on me,
[33:33] What are you saying? If we've made a mistake, then please forgive us.
[33:39] How many things should I forgive? 
[33:41] I married my daughter into your home, thinking that you were educated people.
[33:47] I thought that you would cherish my daughter...
[33:51] I didn't even think that things would be so unjust and cruel to Falak in your home.
[34:00] I don't understand what you're saying.
[34:04] What cruelty has been imposed on her? 
[34:08] We've always treated Falak like a daughter.
[34:13] We've never treated her badly.
If you had treated her like a daughter...
[34:17] then you would have asked Kabir to take care of her.
[34:26] I've told you what my decision is...
[34:31] Falak will not go inside that home... 
[34:33] Falak will only leave when Kabir buys her another house...
[34:37] Let me make this clear to you...
 my daughter isn't a burden on me
[34:45] Look... miss Sultana you have it wrong. 
[34:49] Ask Falak... we've never been unjust to Falak in that home.
[34:53] Falak, please tell them.
[34:58] Aliyah... don't be offended by it...
[35:04] It's Falak's right to have a separate home.
[35:08] Try and understand... one day or the other you have to separate from your brother
[35:14] That's how the world works... everyone leaves at one point or another. 
[35:17] I think you should deal with this gracefully.
[35:20] At least this way you'll salvage your relationship with your brother. 
[35:24] What's the problem with that?
[35:28] Mother I'm tired, I'm going to my room.
[35:39] I'll have tea made for you.
No need... please allow us to leave.
[35:59] What you said was right.
[36:38] Do you see what kind of liars these people are?
[36:41] First, they made my life hell in that house 
[36:44] and now they've come to take me back like they are my family.
[36:48] It's good you told us... you opened our eyes, otherwise, how would we have known?
[36:55] Our decision is correct, you will not return there.
[36:58] You have no idea... whatever that happened today...
[37:02] they will exaggerate it and tell Kabir.
[37:06] He's already upset with me and now things will get worse.
[37:09] Don't worry... if Aliyah does that mother and I will handle it.
[37:15] There's no need for you to worry... alright?
[37:22] Look at me...
[37:26] Rest... okay?
[37:46] I still cannot believe it. 
[37:50] What cruelty did we impose on her?
[37:53] Lord knows what she told her family.
[37:56] The way she tried turning you and Kabir against me...
[38:01] you didn't listen to her. Obviously, they are her family...
[38:07] they believed whatever she told them.
[38:11] Call Kabir right now and ask him to listen to me.
[38:16] Tawqir... don't mention this to Kabir... 
[38:20] he doesn't even know that we went there to bring Falak back.
[38:23] He's already upset, telling him will make things worse.
[38:26] Aliyah, I don't think you have any idea how angry I am.
[38:30] Tawqir... spit out your anger.
How can I?
[38:35] We went there to bring her with love and they disrespected us. 
[38:40] How dare they spoke to us like that.
[38:43] Are you calling Kabir here, or should I go to him?
[38:46] Alright... at least try calming down your anger.
[39:02] What's the matter, sister? Why are you so angry?
[39:07] Kabir it's nothing... leave... I'll talk to you later.
No.
[39:13] We'll talk right now.
