[01:06] I couldn't see their face or the number plate.
[01:10] I came from shopping and I was keeping my bags in the car. Suddenly a bike stopped by,
[01:15] They took Ilham and went away. I couldn't stop them.
[01:20] Such kidnappings are often done for ransom.
[01:23] Do you have doubts about anyone. Can anyone do it?
[01:30] I am not doubting anyone and no such enemies..
[01:35] Yes. Hamza. I believe is Hamza's doing.
[01:41] Who is Hamza?
[01:43] Hamza Hashim.
He is the CEO of Hashim and Co.
[01:46] He's our business competitor and my ex-wife's husband.
[01:50] We have a custody case with my ex-wife and Hamza is supporting her.
[01:55] He threatened us that he'd bother us and not let us live peacefully.
[01:59] I believe if you ask him, he'll tell you where Ilham is.
[02:04] Inspector, do whatever investigation you want to do but please get my daughter.
[02:11] I want my daughter back.
[02:13] See, we'll try our best. I'll inform you as soon as we get an update. Please stay calm.
[02:24] Kabir, I'll call the IG, he's my father's friend.
[02:30] Don't worry, nothing will happen to Nawal. She'll be back soon.
[03:04] Sir, the SHO is here to meet you.
[03:12] SHO?
[03:17] Alright, make him sit, I'll come.
Okay sir.
[03:35] I'll just come.
[03:53] Yes sir, tell me how can I help you?
[03:58] You must know Mr. Kabeer.
[04:01] His daughter was kidnapped in the morning.
[04:04] What?!
[04:05] What?
Are you talking about Ilham?
[04:09] Yes. Mr. Kabeer has only one daughter. Her name is Ilham.
[04:14] Hamza, my daughter..
[04:17] I knew Kabeer wouldn't be able to take care of her thats why I wanted her here with me.
[04:23] Mr. Kabeer and his wife have expressed their suspicions about you.
[04:33] They say that its you behind everything.
[04:40] What?!
[04:49] That's why I need your cooperation. I want to investigate from you.
[04:55] Yes sure but is he mad? Why is he doubting me?
[05:03] I think his daughter's kidnapping has affected his brain. He has lost his mind. Why would we do this?
[05:09] You have a case with him for the custody of the child. Is it so?
[05:15] Yes of course but how does it prove that we have kidnapped the child.
[05:19] We want to bring her to this house, to us.
[05:25] This is our duty. Its the question of an innocent life.
[05:33] See, rather than wasting your time here, you should try and find her.
[05:39] We filed the case against them and that's why they're blaming us.
[05:45] Maybe they have arranged the kidnapping themselves to trap us.
[05:51] You're not understanding their game.
[05:54] Don't waste time here. We're worried as well. Go and get the child as soon as possible.
[06:06] Don't investigate from us but them.
[06:13] Alright. Thank you.
[06:17] My child..
[06:19] Relax, nothing will happen. He said they're looking for her.
[06:29] Why is the police here? Why are you crying? What happened?
[06:33] Someone kidnapped Ilham.
[06:36] What? Why? When?
[06:39] In the afternoon today. The SHO was here for that.
[06:45] This is nobody but Kabeer's doing. Its his game.
[06:49] He got Ilham kidnapped deliberately.
[06:51] So they can put pressure on us and pressurize us.
[06:54] But we'll not come under pressure.
[06:58] Hamza what are you saying, Kabeer is her father. How will her father kidnap her?
[07:03] Mom, Kabeer and Nawal accused us of kidnapping..
[07:11] The child I want to bring in this house as my daughter, would I kidnap her?
[07:18] Falak, we'll go to them right now. Lets go.
[07:44] What happened? Why are you so wired up?
[07:46] I'm not wired up. Are you mad?
[07:51] Who is this child?
[07:53] This is my friend's daughter. His wife has died and he lives alone.
[07:58] He's out of town for a few days. He's asking to take care of her until he comes.
[08:04] Which friend? You've never mentioned such a friend ever.
[08:09] Sher Khan, tell me the truth. Who is this child and where did you bring her from?
[08:15] You are the limit. I didn't bring her from anywhere. She's my friend's daughter.
[08:20] He'll come in a few days and take her back. Why are you worried?
[08:23] Take care of her. I'll get milk for her.
[08:47] Did you find out anything about my daughter?
[08:50] Do whatever it takes but bring my daughter back.
[08:55] What did they say? Did they find anything?
[08:58] They're trying.
[08:59] Kabeer I told you something bad would happen..
[09:02] I told you we should have left from here. You didn't listen to me. Had you listened, our daughter would be here.
[09:09] What did I know that this would happen and such a big incident would happen..
[09:29] Hamza threatened me in the court. He said he would make me suffer.
[09:34] I know he's behind all this.
[09:37] Listen to me. I want to hold his collar and ask him why he's doing this..
[09:42] I'll hold you people accountable.
[10:11] Tell me where is my daughter.
[10:21] That's why I wanted to take her with me.
[10:23] I knew you'd not get time from pampering one another. You'd never take care of my daughter.
[10:32] These things don't sound good from your mouth.
[10:34] If you had taken care of her, she wouldn't have been lost.
[10:38] Your husband is responsible for this. Hold him accountable!
[10:48] I know he has hidden Ilham somewhere.. Ask him. Nobody else can do this.
[10:57] What nonsense is this? What are you saying?
[11:00] You had enmity with us. Why did you bring our daughter in between?
[11:03] She's innocent. Why are you punishing her for this?!
Move back!
[11:17] If I want I can file a case against you for kidnapping Ilham.
[11:38] If something happens to my daughter. I'll kill you.
[11:43] I'll kill you both!
[11:48] I left a piece of my heart with you guys.
[11:51] I should have taken her along. I left her here, trusting you. Where is my daughter!
[12:03] You hid your daughter and are now creating a facade for kidnapping.
[12:15] Do you think both of us our fools?
[12:26] Falak, both of them are creating a drama.
[12:29] You'll see what I do with the two of you.
[12:37] I will raise this point in the court that you're an irresponsible father who cannot take care of his daughter.
[12:50] I'll see then how the court gives you the custody for Ilham.
[13:03] Lets go Falak..
[13:12] What does he mean?
[13:14] Kabeer I'm asking you what did Hamza say? What will happen?
[13:17] This means he'll tell the judge that we cannot take care of our daughter.
[13:23] We're irresponsible and we cannot take care of our daughter.
[13:29] What will happen then?
[13:32] The judge will give the custody to Falak.
[15:18] Eat something. You haven't eaten anything since morning. You'll get sick.
[15:26] How can I eat? I cannot swallow a bite.
[15:37] I don't know whether my daughter had milk or not.
[15:41] How would she be?
[15:47] She doesn't even take milk from just anyone.
[15:56] Did you talk to the SHO?
[16:02] I did. He's reassuring me. But..
[16:10] But these reassurances don't reassure my heart.
[16:19] Nothing will happen to Ilham.
[16:22] She'll be fine and be back to us, by the Grace of God.
If God wills.
[17:04] Make her quiet, why is she crying?
[17:05] I'm trying to give her milk. She isn't taking it.
[17:09] She has been crying ever since she came.
[17:11] Sher Khan you did wrong bringing her here.
[17:16] Listen to me. Call your friend and ask him to take his daughter back.
[17:21] If she stays here, she'll be sick.
[17:24] He is out of town. He'll come tomorrow.
[17:26] Tell him then. Tell him she'll be sick.
[17:31] If something happens to her, we'll have to suffer. Listen to me.
[17:37] I'll call him.
[17:58] Yes, Sher Khan, tell me.
[17:59] Sir, the child is not in a good shape.
[18:03] She isn't eating or drinking milk. She's been crying ever since she came.
[18:06] She's a child. Handle her with care, she'll be fine.
[18:10] And listen don't call me again.
Sir,
[18:14] her condition isn't good. God forbid, if something happens to her, then..
[18:17] Nothing will happen. Do as I say. Its not the time yet.
[18:22] When I tell you, send her back..
[18:25] But sir..
Didn't you hear?
[18:28] Until I say, keep her with you. She won't die.
[18:39] Didn't I say, I'll bother you very much. I'll make you two cry.
[20:17] Were you standing here and listening to me?
[20:20] What are you saying? I thought there must be some information about Ilham or you must be talking to the police so I came here.
[20:27] It was his call. He said don't worry, she'll be found soon.
[21:29] God please, keep my daughter safe. Keep her life safe.
[21:38] Please bless her and bring her out of this trouble. Please bring her to us.
[21:46] You're All Merciful. Please listen to my prayers God. Please.
[22:33] Kabeer, Toqueer is calling.
[22:41] Hello brother..
[22:42] Kabeer so much happened and you didn't tell me.
[22:47] I would have talked to someone. I would have done something.
[22:52] I don't understand what to do.
[22:56] Everything happened so suddenly.
[23:01] We are not in our senses. Its been all day we have been looking for her.
[23:10] I'm sorry.
[23:12] I know. I have an idea how painful it is for you and Nawal. How testing this is? I'm really sorry.
[23:20] Tell me did you complain to the police. What are they saying? Did they tell anything?
[23:27] Yes I did complain.
[23:31] They're saying that they will find the culprits soon.
[23:36] Don't worry. The DSP is my friend. I'll talk to him myself. Everything will be okay if God wills.
[23:41] Don't lose hope. Alright.
Alright.
[23:45] Aaliya and I are coming. I've asked for the tickets. I'll let you know.
[23:52] Aaliya wants to talk to Nawal. Make her talk. Bye.
[24:02] Aaliya wants to talk..
[24:07] Hello, Nawal..
[24:11] If I knew this would happen, I would have never let you go.
[24:20] You gave me Ilham's responsibility and I couldn't take care of her.
[24:26] Nothing will happen, if God wills, you'll find her soon. You'll see.
[24:32] Aaliya please pray that I find my daughter safely. I'll die, I cannot live without her.
[24:41] Nawal.. Nawal you..
[24:44] My dear, you're so strong. Take care of yourself. Be strong.
[24:53] I know you're all alone in this test but right now you don't have to compose yourself but Kabeer as well.
[25:04] If he sees you crying like this, he'll be broken as well. Do you understand?
[25:14] Stay strong please. Take care. Take care of Kabeer as well. We're praying constantly here. Bye.
[25:22] Okay. Bye.
[25:38] God knows what has happened..
[25:39] Remember when Hafsa.. It was such a difficult time.
[25:43] Its very difficult.
Exactly. Ilham is our daughter as well.
[25:50] Give me the phone, I'll call the DSP.
[25:57] Here..
[26:00] I'm going to the police station.
[26:02] Right now? You just came. Get some rest.
[26:07] No Nawal.
[26:10] How can I rest? Our daughter isn't with us.
[26:15] Let me go, I'll be back in a while. Don't worry.
[26:20] Okay, be careful.
[26:52] Hamza.. Did you find anything about Ilham? Where is she?
[26:58] Don't worry. Your daughter will be found.
[27:00] Its been so long. I don't know whether the police is working or not.
[27:04] If you also sit idle how will I find out about my daughter..
[27:09] I have no hopes from Kabeer and Nawal. They'll be at peace like she isn't their daughter.
[27:14] Please do something. Lets go to the police station. Pressurize them to find my daughter from anywhere.
[27:22] See I'm not free. I have a lot to do.
[27:27] You don't have to go anywhere. Go sit in your room. I'll go when I get time.
[27:56] Khan? Sher Khan, wake up..
[28:01] Tell me what is it? Why are you bothering me?
[28:04] I think the child has fever. Her body is burning up. Come and look at her.
[28:12] So what should I do? Am I a doctor, why are you bothering me?
[28:16] Give her medicine for fever, she'll be fine. Don't bother me.
[28:19] Don't bother you?
[28:21] Sher Khan, take the girl to the hospital. Get a doctor.
[28:25] If something happens to her, what will we do?
[28:29] Come and look at her.
I told you don't bother me. Let me sleep.
[29:31] You will talk on this point on the next hearing that Kabeer is an irresponsible man
[29:37] who couldn't take care of his daughter.
[29:39] Let the girl be found first, then we'll see.
We'll get the girl.
[29:47] I mean, the police is doing its work. The child will be found.
[29:54] Alright. Just prepare.
[29:58] The case should not proceed to another hearing.
[30:02] You'll get your payment.
Alright.. Thank you.
[30:17] Yes tell me.. When is the meeting? Alright I'm coming. Okay.
[30:50] Faheem?
Yes sir..
[30:54] Ask the driver to get my car..
Falak mam took your car.
[30:58] Why? Where is her car?
Her car is at the workshop.
[31:05] Alright. Go.
[31:18] I'm Hamza Hashim, I want to track my car's location.
[31:24] Okay.
[31:30] Sir your car is outside city police station.
[31:46] What have you people done uptil now? Why haven't you found my daughter yet?
[31:50] Why are the culprits not caught?
[31:53] See we're trying our best. I've invested my entire team for this.
[32:00] Had you been trying, my daughter would have been with me.
[32:02] Do you know how a mother feels?
[32:05] My daughter is away from my sight since so many days. Why don't you find her?
[32:11] If God wills, we'll find her and we'll catch the culprits soon as well.
[32:40] Arrest them. They're the real culprits. They have kidnapped my daughter.
[32:46] Its their doing so that my daughter doesn't come to me.
[32:51] Put them in jail and they'll tell you the truth.
Are you in your senses?
[32:56] What are you saying?
[33:00] Had we kidnapped her, why would we be searching for her everywhere?
[33:05] This is just a drama to show the world.
[33:08] You can fool the world, the police but not me.
[33:14] Tell me where my daughter is. Where is she?
[33:17] Do you think we're so cheap? We're not like you Falak.
[33:23] Nawal.. Let it be. Its no use arguing with her.
[33:31] Remember this, if I don't find my daughter, I'll not forgive you two.
[33:39] I want my daughter back. God knows what they're taking a revenge for. I made a big mistake.
[33:47] I left my daughter with you.
[33:56] God knows how she must be..
[34:01] Mrs. Hamza control yourself.
[34:03] As soon as we get an update. We'll inform you.
[34:08] Please go home right now.
[35:02] Where did you go?
[35:10] Police station
[35:13] When I told you not to go to the police station without asking me.
[35:18] Why did you go?
[35:23] Don't you understand what I say or don't you value what I say?
[35:28] You just go wherever you want.
I was worried.
[35:31] I told you to come with me but you said no.
[35:35] My daughter is kidnapped. I don't know where she is. How can I be at peace?
[35:40] And you're taunting me as if I committed a sin.
[35:46] Alright. You're missing your daughter a lot.
[35:50] You've never missed her before today.
[35:57] Hamza what are you saying?
[36:00] This is the same daughter,
[36:02] that you left for money. While she was crying. You left her with your ex-husband.
[36:21] And you never asked about her.
[36:23] What are you saying? I told you Kabeer forced me to sign.
[36:29] What do you think? If I don't say anything, I don't know anything?
[36:39] Falak..
[36:42] You're not so simple that someone could force you to sign documents.
[36:47] Its different if you signed them yourself.
[36:51] I can't believe you're saying all this.
[36:57] I believe that aunty must have fed you behind me.
[37:01] Don't involve my mother.
[37:05] This is what you sow that you're reaping.
[37:11] I don't believe it you heard aunty..
Shut up. Just shut up..
[37:24] Why are you angry? What did I do?
[37:29] Falak, after today, you'll not go anywhere without asking me.
[37:36] Alright. I'll not go anywhere. 
[37:39] But why do you forget, I'm a mother.
[37:43] My daughter is a part of me. How can I forget? How can I be at peace?
[37:49] I don't believe you're treating me this way. Do I deserve this?
[37:56]  Let me be. You said you wanted to bring her here. She'd live with me.
[38:02] Yes I did. Because you forced me.
[38:09] I have no attachment with the child. She's not my daughter but Kabeer's. 
[38:15] And let me clear this to you..
[38:17] After today, if you go somewhere without asking me, I'll not tolerate it.
[38:29] Falak I have a reputation in the society and its your duty to respect that.
[38:37] And if you will not stop with your stupid antics.
[38:40]  I'll change my decision and take the case back.
[38:49] You cannot do this Hamza.
[38:51] Falak, I can do this.
[39:00] Hamza.. Hamza.. you cannot do this.
