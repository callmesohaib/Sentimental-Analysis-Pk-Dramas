[00:12] You did this because of me, but now I'm asking you to remove your investment.
[00:18] I want Kabir's life to be destroyed, like he did mine.
[00:23] I want him to feel the same pain that I did.
[00:26] Kabir Salahuddin... who is the owner of a big food chain, divorced me a while ago.
[00:33] People should know how vile he is, even though he seems kind and honorable.
[00:40] There is no need to say anything to Falak, whatever she had said was right.
[00:44] Mother had a heart attack because of you.
[00:47] She's fighting life and death because of you.
[00:51] She couldn't tolerate her daughter lying to her.
[01:05] Mother, what is it? Are you alright?
Falak...
[01:13] I can't...
[01:18] believe...
[01:22] that she lied.
[01:26] Focus on your health, don't think about anything else.
[01:45] I trusted her.
[01:49] I trusted on my upbringing
[01:54] Nothing was lacking in how you raised us.
[01:56] Some people are ungrateful, no matter how much you love them they don't value it
[02:03] I don't think...
[02:06] that I will survive.
[02:08] What are you saying? You'll be completely fine. May God bless you with good health
[02:20] Take care of Ilhaam
[02:26] Make her like you.
[02:30] Mother, you will take care of her.
[02:36] I promise that I will take care of her.
[02:42] Forgive me.
[02:45] Forgive me.
[02:49] I should have listened to you, but I didn't
[02:54] why are you making me a sinner
[02:56] oh God...
[03:00] Mother... mother, what's happening?
[03:04] Excuse me doctor... nurse! Doctor!
mom, one second
[03:13] Please take a look at my mother, something is happening to her.
[03:25] Doctor, look at her.
Mom....
[04:09] I'm sorry, she's no more.
[04:30] No... You're lying...
[04:39] Doctor, listen to me...
[05:43] Hello...
[05:48] What? What are you saying?
[05:52] From God we came and to Him we shall return.
[05:57] What happened Kabir?
[06:00] Auntie Sultana had passed away.
[06:02] What... when?
From God we came and to Him we shall return.
[06:05] Just a while ago, from a heart attack.
[06:10] I think we should go there.
Yes.
[06:16] Sister, have you forgotten the allegations that Falak had put on me?
[06:22] Not once did auntie Sultana say that she was wrong, quite the opposite she was trying to prove us wrong.
[06:27] She was Falak's mother... she was forced to take her side. She was not at fault.
[06:35] Any mother would have done the same.
[06:42] Aliyah is right, we should go there.
[07:35] What are you here for? Do you guys have any shame?
[07:41] Falak, everyone is looking at you.
[07:44] I'm here to offer my condolences, after that I'll leave. There's no need to create a scene.
[07:48] No one needs your sympathy here. It would be better if you all leave! Go away!
[07:53] You had shoved me out of my house. Because of you people, I lost my mother!
[08:01] You murdered my mother!
[08:04] It's an old habit of yours to blame others for your mistake.
[08:08] This is the truth, all of you did this to us.
We don't need you here! Go away!
[08:16] Falak is right... after what you've done to Falak, you guys should not be here
[08:28] Don't get in between this, stay away.
[08:31] Get out of here... I will not let you see my mother's face.
[08:35] Enough Falak!
[08:39] I know the truth very well.
[08:42] Falak is right...
[08:44] Ask them to leave right now.
Hamza, please...
[08:48] I don't need any scenes at my mother's funeral.
[08:51] If anyone has an objection to anyone's presence, they can leave.
[09:27] A few days ago your mother had some changes made in the will.
[09:33] As per the will her entire property belongs to her two daughters.
[09:39] Niwal and Falak.
[09:46] What do you mean?
[09:49] What I'm saying is right... both of you sisters have an equal share.
[09:55] But how can that be... Sultana can never do this.
[09:59] She's the one who had called me here and asked me to write down the will.
[10:04] This house is part of her property and it belongs to both of her daughters.
[10:10] She didn't want to be unjust to any one of them.
[10:17] Can I take a look?
Why not? Sure...
[10:22] Look at this...
Thank you so much.
[10:39] Allow me to leave. If you want to discuss anything, please call me.
[10:45] Alright, thank you.
[10:53] I didn't expect Sultana to be so foolish. I will talk to the lawyer.
[11:00] You are not the lawful inheritor of this property,
[11:07] I don't object to mother's decision and you shouldn't say anything as well.
[11:20] Does it make no difference to you?
[11:26] Without asking you Sultana gave Falak half the property.
This was Falak's right...
[11:30] Mother made a good decision.
[11:33] Falak is not my real sister, but I have always considered her like that
[11:37] I cannot even think of stealing her right from her.
[11:41] You've already given her too much.
[11:44] She couldn't possibly pay back your favors.
[11:47] We did her no favors.
[11:50] Whatever she got she had a right over it.
[11:52] All of this is yours, why don't you understand that?
[11:57] Auntie, I just want your prayers.
[12:00] Pray for me, that's it.
[12:55] Falak and I have bothered you a lot.
Not at all. Daughters are like birds...
[13:01] their singing brings joy to one's home.
[13:09] Seems like it was just yesterday that you were a small kid.
[13:14] and used to run here & there. Now you're older and will get married.
[13:23] My house will be so empty.
[13:42] What are you here for? Have you guys no shame?
[13:47] No one here needs your sympathy.
[13:49] It would be better if you guys leave. You guys shoved me out of your home...
[13:54] because of you all my mother passed away. You guys killed her!
[14:03] Falak is right. After what they did to Falak...
[14:08] you guys shouldn't be here.
[14:34] It was shocking news that Sultana died.
[14:38] When Hamza told me I couldn't believe it. She was perfectly fine when I talked to her a few days ago.
[14:48] She was perfectly fine...
[14:52] she was talking... out of nowhere her heart started hurting.
[14:57] The doctor said that she was out of danger. But...
[15:01] Be strong Nawal... this is all the life she had.
[15:07] It's so strange
[15:09] how a person can leave this world in such a quick instance.
[15:17] She was such a lovely lady.
[15:20] May God give her heaven and make the rest of her endeavors easier.
[15:29] Niwal... you are so brave...
[15:35] I can't believe that my mother is gone.
[15:39] Don't cry, my dear.
[15:42] Crying hurts the soul of the one who has passed away.
[15:47] Be strong, all of us are with you.
[15:51] Good girl.
[15:53] I heard that poor Falak is divorced, how's her daughter?
[16:00] Thank God she's fine.
[16:05] I know that the two of you are very alone after your mother's passing.
[16:09] But I'm like your mother as well.
[16:13] I'm like your mother. If you need anything...
[16:19] don't feel that you're alone.
[16:22] Nazish is like your sister. Both of us are with you.
[16:27] hmm?
[16:30] It will be okay.
[16:39] Come in.
[16:43] Is Mr. Kamal here for the meeting?
No sir, he isn't here.
[16:45] Why not? Wasn't he supposed to be here?
[16:48] His secretary called, he won't be coming.
[16:51] But why?
[16:52] His secretary said that he is hesitating to work with us after miss Falak's press conference.
[17:01] Alright... you can leave.
Thank you.
[17:12] It's so embarrassing that Kabir had this kind of behavior with Falak.
[17:18] You are a woman, you shouldn't have supported Kabir in this.
[17:23] Whatever allegations Falak has made are lies.
[17:27] Kabir loved her... he respected her.
[17:31] But the way Falak was crying, it seemed like she was telling the truth.
[17:38] You know us well...
[17:41] Kabir is not like this. He's an educated person.
[17:46] He knows how to respect women. How could you say this?
[17:51] The things that are being said about you guys in the society...
[17:55] I thought Falak was speaking the truth.
[17:58] the thing is even if the entire city supports a bunch of lies,
[18:03] that doesn't make it the truth. It will always remain a lie.
[18:06] Alright, why are you being angry? I just mentioned it.
[18:12] I heard that Falak created quite the scene at her mother's funeral.
[18:18] Neelum I'm busy right now, I'll talk to you later.
[18:23] Greetings*
[18:25] Kabir, how come you're home early? Is everything alright?
[18:32] I just don't feel well.
[18:37] Didn't you have a meeting with Mr. Kamal? How was it?
[18:45] I didn't have that meeting.
[18:48] He canceled it.
[18:50] He had canceled it, But why?
[18:55] He believed what he heard.
[19:00] It's because of the allegations that Falak put on me.
[19:07] Come here...
[19:21] Why are you playing with her?
[19:24] Ask Falak to take care of her. She's her mother.
[19:29] She's on the phone all day, she has no time for her daughter.
[19:33] What's with you, auntie? What's the difference?
[19:37] She doesn't do anything. At least she can take responsibility for her.
[19:42] It brings me joy.
[19:45] That's why I pick her up... don't say such things.
[19:49] That's exactly the reason why she is so bold.
[19:54] Alright, don't be angry at me.
[19:57] I'm not being angry, I'm trying to make you understand.
[20:01] What you're doing is wrong... you're spoiling her and later you will regret it.
[20:08] Auntie before mother died made me promise that I would take care of Ilhaam
[20:15] Whether Falak takes care of her or not, I have to fulfill her promise.
[20:18] That's fine...
[20:20] but she's her mother. She should realize her responsibility.
[20:24] If she doesn't, then we need to make her realize it.
[20:39] After a woman is divorced it is compulsory for the man to pay the alimony
[20:45] I know the law, that's why I won't be pressurized.
[20:57] I was disappointed to hear auntie's death
[21:01] She was your only support.
[21:04] She supported you a lot.
She was the only one
[21:08] She left as well. Now I feel that I have no support.
[21:13] One more time I'm alone.
[21:16] Be strong Falak.
[21:23] What have you decided? What will you do now?
[21:28] Nothing... I haven't decided anything.
[21:34] Miss Falak...
[21:39] She's your daughter, right?
[21:44] Falak, don't take this the wrong way.
[21:47] Kabir divorced you and you brought her with you.
[21:51] You're such a fool. You've freed him and he'll remarry.
[21:57] Your life has been ruined. You will raise her for the rest of your life.
[22:03] You won't be able to go anywhere. You will be restricted.
[22:08] And your career...
[22:11] by the way, have you taken anything from Kabir after the divorce or not?
[22:18] What does he have to give?
[22:21] Oh my God Falak! You are so stupid!
[22:24] You could have had a great sum during the settlement.
[22:30] And what about your alimony? I'm sure he gave that to you.
[22:35] No... I didn't take it.
What?
[22:40] You didn't even take your alimony as well. How much was it?
[22:46] Fifty lacs.
[22:48] Oh Falak, I've never seen a greater fool than you.
[22:53] You didn't do the things you were supposed, rather you did the things that you weren't supposed to.
[22:58] Falak talk to them and ask for your alimony.
[23:03] This is not a meager sum, you can do a lot of things with that money.
[23:08] You've been divorced, at least you should gain something from this.
[23:14] You're right.
[23:17] I didn't think about this. I acted like an emotional mess.
[23:22] Get the money first, then I'll tell you where to invest it.
[23:28] Thank you, Maria... you opened my eyes.
[23:31] I will do the same.
[23:33] Most welcome... if they don't agree, then tell me.
[23:37] I have a good lawyer, I'll give you his number and you can talk to him.
[23:52] My dear... I'm ashamed...
[23:56] I couldn't be at Sultana's death. You know, I was not well.
[24:01] Uncle, please... I understand, don't be ashamed.
[24:08] When I got better, the doctor allowed me to walk.
[24:13] I came right here. Sultana was my only sister.
[24:18] When I heard of her death, I wanted to be at her funeral.
[24:25] But...
[24:30] I couldn't see my sister's face one last time.
[24:33] Safdar be patient... all of us have to leave one day.
[24:40] Pray for Sultana's forgiveness... if you keep crying like this, you'll get sick.
[24:47] She's right, don't cry, you'll be unwell.
[24:54] My dear... there is no need for you to worry. Pray to God to give me health.
[25:01] I will visit you frequently.
[25:05] After mother, you're the only one I have. I will pray for your health.
[25:12] I hope God gives you a life where you watch over us.
[25:19] Amen.
[25:27] Auntie, couldn't you stay for a few more days?
[25:31] My dear, your uncle is in therapy.
[25:34] After he gets better... I'll come here with you
[25:40] My heart will be diverted towards you.
[25:44] I was strong while you were here.
[25:50] What will I do alone when you leave?
[25:53] Don't worry, I'll call you every day...
[26:00] You need to be strong...
[26:30] Oh my God Falak! You are so stupid!
[26:33] You could have had a great sum during the settlement.
[26:37] You didn't take your alimony. I've never seen a bigger fool than you in my life.
[26:43] You didn't do the things you were supposed, rather you did the things that you weren't supposed to.
[26:50] Ask for your alimony. This is not a meager sum, you can do a lot with it.
[27:01] Maria is right, not once did it occur to me.
Fifty lacs...
[27:07] This is not a meager amount.
[27:11] I can do a lot with it. What did I gain by marrying Kabir?
[27:18] I should at least get my right!
[27:29] I'm surprised at the people.
[27:32] A woman lies with tears in her eyes and everyone believes her.
[27:40] Sister, we've endured such a great loss, I don't know how we'll recover it.
[27:56] You... how dare you come here?
[28:01] I don't like coming here as well. I need to talk to you.
[28:06] Get out of here... otherwise, I'll shove you out.
Wait, Kabir.
[28:16] What is it?
[28:20] I need my alimony.
[28:24] What?
Why are you so surprised?
[28:29] I need my alimony...
the fifty lacs that you didn't give me.
[28:34] I need them...
[28:35] What alimony are you talking about? This relationship ended because of you.
[28:40] Really, because of me? I didn't take the divorce, but you gave me
[28:46] And in that circumstances, the man must pay the alimony... I know the law.
[28:53] That's why I won't be pressured by you. It would be wise if you give me my alimony.
[29:00] Otherwise...
Otherwise, what will you do?
[29:04] I will file a case.
[29:06] On you.
[29:12] Alright... you want your alimony... I will give it to you.
[29:17] But before that, you will need to do another press conference...
[29:21] You will have to tell everyone that you lied. You have to tell the truth to everyone!
[29:28] We've endured a great loss because of you.
[29:30] So? Do you think I'm a fool?
[29:34] I will not do anything like that.
[29:41] Alright then, forget your alimony
[29:45] I will ensure to get my alimony
[29:49] No matter what.
[30:59] Hello Maria... I need that lawyer's number, please send it to me.
[31:06] Thank you.
[31:28] Greetings... Maria gave me your number.
[31:32] I wanted to talk about a case.
[31:39] but Kabir, you did already paid her the alimony's amount, right?
No, I didn't.
[31:43] She said that she would take it when she needed it. I kept it to the side.
[31:48] But when the company started declining, I invested in the company.
[31:53] Tawqir... do you have that amount in your account?
[31:59] If I had known earlier, I would have arranged something but...
[32:04] it's not possible right now.
[32:08] I told you that our company is opening up offices in Germany. All the money has been invested there.
[32:16] If Falak files for this case, this will be a huge problem.
[32:21] Our image is already ruined.
[32:24] All people need is a chance to talk.
[32:30] Things like this will harm the company, that's why I don't want this reaching court.
[32:37] We should sort this, outside of the courtroom.
Fifty lacs is a huge sum.
[32:42] All my money is in the market and I can't take it out.
[32:47] The company's account doesn't have that amount as well.
[32:50] Where will we get the money from?
Don't worry.
[32:54] We'll do something.
I know Falak is doing this on purpose.
[33:00] She knows that we are in a bad position.
[33:25] Kabir divorced you and you brought her back. This will free him to remarry.
[33:33] Your life has been ruined, you'll raise her for the rest of your life. You won't be able to go anywhere.
[33:40] You will be restricted.
[33:51] Why are you here with her? Take her to the other room!
[33:55] but maam
Enough! Go away!
[34:13] Sir... your courier is here.
[34:43] What is it? Why are you worried?
[34:48] Falak has sent a notice to pay the alimony.
[34:55] The situation is getting out of control.
[34:59] She has given me a week.
[35:02] from where we will arrange such an amount in a week?
[35:07] I don't understand anything.
[35:10] I'll talk to the lawyer. Don't worry, Let's see what he says.
[35:24] Take care of her... I'm not her nanny.
[35:27] Why should I take care of her day and night?
[35:30] She's your daughter...
[35:32] Should I die for her? Mother brought her here, I had already left her
[35:37] You stay at work all day and leave me in this hell.
[35:41] Do you have any idea what you're saying?
[35:44] What should I do? My life has been turned to hell!
[35:47] I know you guys brought her here so that I couldn't live peacefully. 
[35:52] I can't tolerate this anymore, take care of her!
[36:08] Zakiya... 
yes maam
[36:10] Ilhaam is sleeping in my room. When she gets up ask Falak to feed her and give her medicine. I've kept it above the drawer.
[36:16] Sure miss.
[36:18] Have breakfast.
[36:19] I'm not hungry, I'll eat at work if I have to. Check up on Ilhaam.
[36:25] Sure, don't worry.
Farewell.
[36:54] Sorry, one second.
[36:59] What is it Zakiya?
Miss...
[37:02] What happened, why are you crying?
I don't know what's happened to Ilhaam.
[37:06] What happened to Ilhaam? Is she alright?
Niwal, what happened?
[37:11] I don't know what's happened to her, she has turned blue.
[37:14] And on top of that, she's vomiting.
Where's Falak? Tell her, I'll be right there.
[37:19] She's outside, she's not picking up. Her phone is off.
[37:25] Hurry on home. I don't know what to do.
Don't worry... I'm coming.
[37:32] Try to stop her from crying. Keep your phone on. I'll be right there.
[37:40] Niwal, what happened to Ilhaam?
She's not feeling well, I have to go home
[37:45] I'll come with you.
Come on.
[38:10] Zakiya...
[38:13] What happened to her?
She won't stop crying.
[38:19] I fed her the milk that miss Falak made for her.
[38:26] I think we should take her to the doctor. Bring this with you,
[38:39] Kabir... don't worry... Ilhaam will get better.
[38:46] She has small hands... 
[38:49] she'll be in pain when they apply a drip to her. How will she bear it
[38:54] Kabir, this is part of the treatment. It will make her feel better.
[39:02] I knew it... I knew that she wouldn't be able to take care of my daughter. 
[39:07] That's why I didn't want to send her away.
[39:10] She is ungracious. 
[39:12] She doesn't care about anyone but herself.
[39:19] Once my daughter is well... I'll keep her with me.
