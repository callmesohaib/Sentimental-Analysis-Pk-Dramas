[00:12] Please calm down, I am sure there must be some misunderstanding. I apologize.
[00:16] Just leave it brother Toqeer. Kabir drop me to my mom's house.
[00:19] I don't want to live here. You keep your house and relations.
[00:23] I don't want to live here. Please drop me to mom's house right now.
Falak.
[00:26] I am hopeful that all your doubts and grievances are gone.
[00:33] Please clear your heart for Falak.
[00:36] She is a nice girl.
[00:39] I was going to give his phone. He forgot that.
[00:41] These are some important documents. I will give him by myself.
[00:44] You don't worry, I will give him. Go and take rest.
OK do it with care.
[01:08] I want to tell you something about Asjad.
[01:13] I called Nawal but she didn't believe me.
[01:18] About Asjad?
[01:21] What do you want to discuss regarding Asjad?
[01:26] Asjad is not a good man.
[01:31] Whatever I know about him, I can't tell you but just understand that he is deceiving you.
[01:39] He is about to cause a big loss to you so please be careful.
[01:43] How do you know all of this about Asjad?
[01:47] A friend of mine works with him and knows him very well. He has told me everything about him.
[01:57] And I called Nawal to tell this..
You alarmed us, it's your generous act.
[02:04] I will handle this matter.
[02:08] I think you are not taking my words seriously or you are thinking that I am lying to you.
[02:15] You just told me whatever you had to tell. As I said, I will handle this matter myself, Hamza.
[02:22] I admit that I am wrong and you and Nawal don't trust me.
[02:31] If you don't believe me then I have brought that boy with me and he is waiting outside in car.
[02:37] If you want then I will ask him to come here so that you can ask him by yourself.
[02:41] There is no need for that.
[02:44] Aunt please don't do this injustice to Nawal.
[02:54] You?
[03:00] What are you doing here?
[03:03] I came here to talk to aunt.
[03:25] You?
[03:28] How dare you to come here? Why are you here?
[03:32] Aunt please listen to us just for once, after that we will leave.
[03:37] Aunt please don't believe his words, he is a fraudster and I have proof of that.
[03:49] Hamza, it's our personal matter.
[03:52] It would be better if you don't interfere in it.
[03:54] I have told you everything about him even then you are saying this?
[03:57] Because this is our personal matter.
[04:01] And I don't want anyone to interfere in it so it would be better if you leave from here.
[04:30] And you too go from here or do I push you out from here?
[04:36] My child you are right in your anger.
[04:38] It's our mistake.
[04:41] Aunt we are so ashamed. Whatever happened was very wrong.
[04:45] We were blind folded due to greed.
[04:49] Give me punishment whatever you want but please don't refuse this proposal.
[04:54] What? We don't want to maintain any relation with you.
[05:02] Are you observing their courage?
[05:05] They have come here even after so much has happened.
[05:12] You should be ashamed. How can you even think that we will maintain any relation with you?
[05:21] Sister Sultana, advise her that these relations don't end that easily.
[05:28] This is not a minor thing. This is a very huge thing.
[05:32] You should be thankful to us that we didn't file any complain in police against you
[05:38] otherwise you would have been in police lock up today.
[05:45] Don't bother to come here again.
[05:55] Have you listened?
[05:59] So please go from here now.
[06:23] This one is the best offer for you for now.
[06:28] I am sure that no one can give you a offer like this.
[06:43] I think Mr. Kabir, you are joking with us and you are not serious for this deal.
[06:48] What do you mean?
[06:49] There are no documents regarding the deal in this file. Neither it contains your tax documents.
[06:55] How much tax you paid last year?
[06:57] You haven't attached those documents or you want to hide those intentionally.
[07:01] And our company won't make any deal with a company which is not paying tax.
[07:07] What do you mean? What are you talking about? I have attached those documents in this file myself.
[07:11] How is it possible?
[07:20] I am sorry. I am really sorry. Give me some time. I will bring those documents.
[07:29] We scheduled this meeting with you because we liked your work
[07:32] and we wanted to make this deal with you but it is not possible now.
[07:36] We don't have that much time. We have another meeting and if we won't finalize the deal there then we will contact you.
[07:42] Thank you so much for you time.
[08:02] Why had Hamza come here?
He came here to tell me about Asjad.
[08:08] He said, I called Nawal but she didn't listen to me.
[08:12] You didn't even tell me about that.
Would you believe if I told you?
[08:19] You would feel that I am lying and misguiding you.
[08:27] I believe on you that much.
[08:29] You should have told me once.
[08:32] Perhaps their real face had to be revealed like that.
[08:40] And to be honest, I didn't trust Hamza that's why I didn't tell you.
[09:12] Hey Kabir you are back from office, how was your meeting?
[09:17] Where is sister?
She is in her room. Is everything alright?
[09:26] Sister.
[09:31] Why did you come back that early? Has your meeting ended?
[09:39] Yes meeting has done.
[09:42] But we missed the deal.
But why?
[09:47] There were some documents missing in the file which I took there so the deal got canceled.
[09:53] Documents were missing?
[09:55] But I returned that file in the same state in which you gave me so how can documents be missed?
[10:04] I don't know sister, I didn't check that myself.
[10:07] You should have checked in car, how can you be so irresponsible Kabir?
[10:12] Sister I have checked in car and everywhere else but I didn't find.
[10:19] Sister file was with you, so check, you must have put those documents somewhere in the room.
[10:24] This is not possible.
[10:27] I didn't open the binding of that file so how can I take documents out from that file?
[10:32] I don't put things carelessly anywhere like that.
[10:36] Check in every drawer, it must be somewhere here.
[10:47] I haven't put these documents here. How have these come here?
[10:58] These are the same documents. Thank God we have found these. I was so afraid.
[11:03] You must have forgotten after putting these here.
[11:07] Believe me, I didn't unbind the file then how can I put these documents here.
[11:13] There must be someone else who put these here.
Stop it sister.
[11:19] File was with and documents have found from your drawer.
[11:25] You spoiled everything and now blaming someone else.
Kabir.
[11:31] Falak, the actual thing is that we have found these important documents.
[11:39] Thank God, let me attache these in file. Maybe we get that deal again.
[11:50] You knew that how important that deal was for Kabir?
[11:55] I am sure that you must have hide these documents. You didn't want Kabir to get this deal.
[12:01] Why would I want that Kabir don't get this deal?
[12:04] As much as Kabir owns this business, I own this business that much as well.
[12:08] If Kabir will get any loss then it will be my loss as well.
[12:12] Yes, only you know that why did you do that? But whatever you did was really bad.
[12:45] Kabir
[12:49] Don't you worry. Everything will get better.
[12:53] I found these documents but the deal got canceled because of my little mistake.
[13:02] What's your mistake in it, it's sister Aliya's mistake.
[13:06] It's my mistake.
[13:08] I should have checked the file once before that meeting.
[13:12] What's the fault of sister Aliya in that?
[13:15] If she put those papers unintentionally anywhere but I had to attend the meeting. If I would check the file once.
[13:24] So big mistake. This didn't ever happen.
[13:31] I thought that sister has checked the file then it must be fine.
[13:36] So you see the result of trusting others more than yourself.
[13:42] Sometime we face some incidents in our life.
[13:46] So that our eyes get open and we can differentiate among our own relatives and other ones.
[13:51] Now you must have been realized that we get loss due to blind trust on others.
[13:58] If I would check file myself then this didn't happen.
[14:02] I don't know, how did sister make such a big mistake?
[14:07] I think she forgot because of her illness and she ignored that.
[14:14] It is also possible that she intentionally hide those documents.
[14:19] What?
[14:21] Why would sister do that intentionally?
[14:24] I feel like that.
Never. Sister can never do that.
[14:30] In fact sister can never even think about causing any loss to me.
[14:34] Falak, just think before you say anything that what are you saying and about whom are you saying?
[14:41] I was just saying Kabir, why are you getting angry on me?
[14:45] Every word has it's meaning and I am understanding what is going on in your mind at the moment.
[14:50] I already told you that I won't bear any blame on sister Aliya.
[14:56] Kabir, you are getting me wrong, it was just a mere thinking so I just told you.
[15:02] And I know about sister Aliya as well that she can't do that.
[15:06] After all she has equal share in business like you.
[15:09] And if any loss is caused to business then it will effect her as well so why will she want any loss happen to the business?
[15:16] It would be better to act upon your words.
[15:55] Hamza, it's our personal matter and we don't want anyone to interfere in it.
[16:00] So it would be better for you to go from here.
[16:33] Hamza where are you? I am unable to see you.
[16:37] And Areej was also complaining that you are not giving her time.
[16:41] Actually, I was busy in office work. We have launched some new projects so I was busy in those.
[16:48] No matter how busy you are but you have to spare some time for the family.
[16:53] Tell me, do you want to discuss something with me?
[16:55] Actually, I want to discuss something really important with you.
[17:01] Brother and sister-in-law are coming next week
[17:04] so I was thinking that I should arranged engagement function of you and Areej.
[17:12] What? Are you joking?
No, I am very serious.
[17:20] I am telling you upfront that don't do any such thing.
[17:23] Don't complain if I ashamed you in front of everyone.
[17:26] And what about that what you are doing? You are ruining your life for a girl who is marrying other guy.
[17:35] I am sorry. I have decided. You will have to marry to Areej. That's it.
[17:42] I have already told you that I don't like Areej.
[17:45] She is very nice girl, she will keep you very happy.
[17:48] You will start liking her after marriage. The words of Nikah are really powerful.
[17:55] This is your misunderstanding. How can I be happy with someone whom I don't like?
[18:00] Don't force to be strict with you.
[18:03] I don't know, I want you to get married to Areej. That's it.
[18:07] You have one week. Make you mind understand and I want you answer in affirmation. And that's that.
[18:53] Greetings
[18:59] I just met Kabir.
[19:02] He told me that you unintentionally...
[19:06] Don't say anything else.
[19:08] I am thinking about that again and again. I think I will go mad.
[19:13] Calm down. Nothing will happen. Take deep breathes.
[19:20] Drink water. Nothing will happen.
[19:25] Listen, it's a business, such minor things happen. It's not a big deal. Calm down.
[19:32] First time I have seen doubt in Kabir's eyes for me.
[19:37] I have seen disbelief.
[19:40] Do you think that I can be that much irresponsible that I will put such important documents in a drawer like that?
[19:47] I am not doing such activities for the first time. Am I starting any new business?
[19:50] Aliya mistakes are made by humans.
[19:54] It is possible that you put those documents in drawer.
[19:58] What difference does it make?
[20:00] Toqeer I didn't even unbind that file.
[20:04] Do you think I am mad?
[20:07] I gave that file to Falak to handover to Kabir.
[20:10] Aliya stop it.
[20:13] There has been so much fuss already in this house don't do anymore.
[20:18] And you know it very well that both of us will have to face it's consequences so please let it go.
[20:26] I am just thinking.
Aliya
[20:32] What happened to you?
[20:36] You were not like that earlier to blame others for your mistakes. You never lied.
[20:45] Listen, mistakes are made by humans. If you made the mistake so just own it.
[20:52] I am unable to understand anything. I am feeling very helpless.
[20:55] No problem. I am with you.
[20:59] I didn't do that.
[21:01] Stop it. It will get better. Stop crying.
[21:07] Aliya
[21:09] You can't get married to Nawal. Forget her.
[21:13] Why can't it be?
[21:14] And now I am telling both of you that don't worry. I will take complete care of sister.
[21:31] What? You refused that proposal?
Yes
[21:37] But why?
[21:41] We inquired about them, they are not good people.
[21:46] But mom you should have done that before accepting the proposal.
[21:54] It was our mistake.
[21:56] Blind trust causes damage.
[21:59] Thank God that you didn't sell the house and gave money to them.
[22:05] I was worried that what would you do and where would you go if you would have sold this house?
[22:10] We would go somewhere.
[22:11] God's earth is very big.
[22:17] I will bring tea.
[22:24] What happened to her?
[22:25] Think before saying anything. She is your elder sister.
[22:30] But what did I say mom?
[22:33] That was just an engagement, no problem if it is broken. By the way, sister Nawal didn't love Asjad,
[22:38] neither they talked nor liked each other. Then why is she reacting like that.
[22:42] No problem if this engagement is broken.
[22:48] What was you saying? What have Aliya done now?
[22:52] What do I tell you mom? She has made my life hell.
[22:56] Let me tell you tomorrow's incident. Kabir faced billions of rupees loss because of sister Aliya.
[23:03] What are you talking about?
[23:05] Let me tell you. Do you know, Kabir gave her a file.
[23:42] I think Mr. Kabir, you are joking with us and you are not serious for this deal.
[23:48] There are no documents regarding the deal in this file.
[23:54] Believe me, I didn't even unbind this file then how can I put these documents here?
[24:12] I didn't put these documents here. How have these come here?
[24:25] Did you see the result of trusting others more than yourself? Sometime such incidents happen in our life.
[24:33] So that our eyes get open and we can differentiate among our own relatives and other ones.
[24:38] Now you must have realized that we get loss due to blind trust on others.
[26:10] What's wrong with you?
[26:12] Why are you bothering me?
[26:13] Nawal understand my point. Don't commit this suicide.
[26:18] He doesn't deserve you. He has already cheated so many girls before you.
[26:24] Mom has already refused him.
[26:28] Did you want to hear this? Right?
Did you want this?
[26:32] Now get happy.
[26:47] Sure, we will meet next week. OK
Mom.
[26:54] OK, I will call you in a while. OK. See you bye.
[26:58] Hmm?
[27:00] You will have to take my proposal for Nawal tomorrow.
[27:03] What? Perhaps you have forgotten that she is engaged and she is going to marry soon.
[27:07] That engagement is broken.
But why?
[27:12] Just leave all this.
[27:13] You just have to go to their house and convince them for this proposal at any cost.
[27:18] You can't get married to Nawal. Forget her.
Why can't that happen?
[27:23] Because I have decided that you will be engaged with Areej.
[27:26] In fact I am thinking to arrange your Nikah ceremony.
[27:30] Get ready, your Nikah is scheduled this Friday.
[27:33] But you can't take such a big decision without my consent.
[27:36] Why, why I can't make this decision? I am your mother and I have that much right on you.
[27:40] I am telling you that I won't marry Areej.
[27:42] You will humiliate yourself by gathering all relatives.
[27:46] I will reject this proposal in front of everyone.
[27:48] Will you humiliate your mother in front of everyone for that stranger girl? Have you gone crazy?
[27:55] She is not stranger. I love her.
[27:59] What to do next will be your decision.
[28:53] Greetings sweetie what are you doing?
[28:56] I am reading.
Oh, you are reading. Good.
[29:04] Where is your mom?
[29:05] You are back?
Greetings sister.
[29:11] How are you feeling sister?
[29:13] I am fine. Nasreen go. I will call you.
[29:26] Kabir
[29:29] I am really sorry that company has suffered such a huge loss because of me.
[29:34] It's OK sister, such things happen in business.
[29:42] That was my mistake, I don't know when and how did I put those documents in drawer?
[29:48] Perhaps I did that under influence of sleeping pills. I don't remember anything.
[29:53] Sister you are thinking so much. As I said, it doesn't make any difference.
[29:59] Company gets so much profits then what if it gets a minor loss.
[30:06] Aren't you thinking that I did that intentionally.
Sister
[30:12] Please don't make me embarrassed by saying all this.
[30:16] I know you very well. You can never do that.
[30:18] In fact anyone who knows you will say the same thing.
[30:25] Hey Kabir, you are here?
[30:28] Do I bring tea for you?
No, I don't want that.
[30:33] OK get fresh.
[30:40] OK sister, let me get fresh and then meet you
[30:49] Why are you sitting here sister? Go to your room and take rest. You are not feeling well.
[30:56] I am fine. Thank you.
[30:59] Let me take care of Kabir.
[31:26] You are looking good. Black color suits on you.
[31:31] Every color looks good on me.
[31:35] Yes it is right.
[31:37] By the way, I am really excited that we are going out for dinner after a long time.
[31:43] Yes
[31:45] I am feeling good.
[31:47] Let's go. Let's go quickly otherwise we will get late. Let's go.
[31:58] You are right.
[32:00] Hey sister, why are you standing here?
[32:02] I was going to doctor for checkup but car is not starting.
[32:07] What happened to car?
[32:09] I think there is some fault in engine. I need to take care to workshop.
[32:14] Sudden failure of car. Don't you worry. I will take you to doctor.
[32:20] Kabir
[32:21] We are invited, our friends must be waiting for us. They have arranged this dinner for us.
[32:27] No problem Kabir, I will go tomorrow for checkup.
No sister.
[32:33] Dinner is not important than your appointment.
[32:37] No problem, we will go a bit late. Come with me.
[32:40] No, your program will be spoiled because of me. Toqeer must be about to come. I will go with him.
[32:47] Are you sure?
[32:49] Go and enjoy your dinner please.
[32:53] OK, bye.
Bye
[33:01] Kabir
[33:08] Sister
[33:18] Falak bring water.
[33:23] What happened to you suddenly sister?
Falak bring water.
[33:51] I won't marry Areej, I am telling you.
[33:54] You will humiliate yourself by gathering all relatives.
[33:57] I will reject this proposal in front of everyone.
[34:37] My child, why are you standing here at this time? Couldn't you get sleep?
[34:43] I was suffocating in the room so I thought to come outside.
[34:49] Why are you awake? Aren't you sleepless like me?
[34:53] I sleep less.
[34:56] The person who has made us sleepless is sleeping so peacefully. Isn't he?
[35:03] Well, my child, I want to apologize to you for Hamza's behavior.
[35:12] You don't need to apologize.
[35:15] I know Hamza since childhood and I know his nature very well.
[35:21] He likes challenges. And perhaps he has taken me so easy.
[35:27] You know that Hamza doesn't give importance to things which he gets easily. 
[35:33] Those things used to be found in dustbin or any corner of house.
[35:38] And the things which he got easily lost their worth for him, just like me.
[35:47] That's why Hamza rejected me. Didn't he?
What?
[35:54] Yes, I have heard your discussion with Hamza.
[36:05] Aunt
[36:07] Do whatever he wants. Get him married wherever he wants.
[36:13] Forcefulness will be of no use.
[36:16] And you know it very well that he will never back off from his demand.
[36:23] Forcefulness will be of no use.
[36:29] If the relations are formed forcefully then those relations are not long lasting.
[36:35] And the relation between husband and wife is the only relation if there is no love in it then it will become barren.
[36:42] And such relations don't give happiness to anyone but only cause sorrow nothing else.
[36:50] Please
[36:52] Agree with him.
[36:57] My child.
[37:00] I am really embarrassed in front of you. I am so sorry.
[37:27] Her blood pressure is very low and a lot of weakness as well.
[37:33] I think she is not taking her diet properly. I feel that she must have some stress or depression.
[37:39] Please get her proper checkup.
[37:43] OK doctor.
[37:45] I am prescribing some test. Conduct these. Take care of her diet.
[37:53] And try to save her from stress.
[37:57] Don't tell her about any problem or worry.
[38:01] Give her rest as much as you can.
[38:04] Look Kabir, I ask sister to take rest but she always gets busy in work.
[38:10] Health is important as well.
[38:17] I am prescribing some multi-vitamins for her. Give her regularly. God willing she will get better soon.
[38:25] Kabir, what happened to Aliya?
[38:29] As soon as I got Falak's call, I have come here. Is she alright?
[38:32] Brother she fainted because of weakness, relax, she is fine.
[38:47] Conduct these tests.
[38:48] OK, thank you so much.
[38:53] Let me see him off.
[38:57] Aliya
[38:59] Are you OK?
[39:12] Brother, no need to worry. Sister is stressed and over burdened so that' why.
[39:19] She will get well soon. God willing.
[39:22] And now I am telling both of you to don't worry I will take complete care of sister.
[39:29] God willing.
[39:33] Thanks Falak.
