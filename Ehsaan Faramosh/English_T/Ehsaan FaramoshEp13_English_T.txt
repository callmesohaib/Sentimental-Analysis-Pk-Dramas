[00:12] For public meetings there are parks and restaurants.
[00:15] While offices are for doing work, miss Nawal.
[00:21] You promised me that both of us will go for honeymoon.
[00:25] Isn't there any importance of your promise and my desire?
[00:29] I used to consider you my sister but what did you do to me?
[00:34] I want to go for honeymoon only with my husband, not on a business trip.
[00:38] Then why was sister saying that now I won't have to do everything as per my wishes rather I will have to take care of Falak's desires as well.
[00:47] Perhaps she takes care of everyone that's why she thought like that.
[01:02] Hello
Let me talk to miss Nawal.
[01:20] Hello
Nawal, I am Hamza's mother Sophia.
[01:29] I want to talk to you, do you have five minutes for me?
[01:32] Well, greetings.
Greetings.
[01:39] Hamza often talks about you.
[01:44] He is really worried for you and I can't see my son worried.
[01:50] I want to end the misunderstanding among both of you.
[01:54] Everything among us has been finished.
[01:59] No, don't say that, he wants to include you in his life.
[02:07] And I don't think that everything is ended from your side, it's just a cold war.
[02:14] Don't give into it. It's a loss for both of you.
[02:20] Look, man makes mistake.
[02:24] Hamza has made a mistake.
[02:26] Even God doesn't close the door of forgiveness, think about it.
[02:31] I have forgiven your son.
[02:34] Then what's the problem?
[02:35] Problem is that aunt that I am engaged with my consent and my mom's consent.
[02:43] And now I have closed every door of my past after this new relationship.
[02:50] Emotional decisions are wrong and cause regrets for whole life.
[02:57] Are you happy with this engagement?
[03:04] Hamza made a wrong decision and he is bearing it's burden till date.
[03:08] And now you have made this decision of your engagement,
[03:11] do you want to bear the burden of this wrong decision throughout your life?
[03:20] Don't make this mistake, you will regret a lot.
Think with a cool mind.
[03:27] It will effect your whole life.
[03:30] If a person asks for forgiveness after making mistakes then he should be forgiven.
[03:56] OK, prepare it's contract.
[04:21] This is my resignation. I can't work around you in this office now.
[04:27] What is this? What happened to you suddenly?
I am not a robot Hamza.
[04:34] I am a living girl who has emotions and feelings but you neither took care for those earlier nor you are taking care of those now.
[04:43] You want me to do whatever you want me to do.
[04:47] If you leave me then I wait for you and if you come back then you find me at the same place where you had left me.
[04:53] Why do you think like that? Tell me.
[04:58] It's my life, isn't it?
[05:00] Whether I settle or ruin it, who the hell are you?
[05:04] Relax Nawal.
[05:06] What happened, tell me?
Don't contact me again now.
[05:11] Change your habit of making fun of me everywhere.
[05:15] If you couldn't convince me then you asked your mother to call me.
[05:22] You want me to make relationships and end relationships whenever you want but no, I am not like you.
[05:29] I don't make relations to break.
[06:33] What's up Falak?
Hello sister Nawal.
[06:37] Me and Kabir are going for honeymoon, we have a flight tomorrow.
[06:42] Wow, many congratulations.
[06:46] Won't you come to meet us?
[06:49] No, as you know that last time there was so much bad omen.
[06:55] Mom fell down from stairs and our flight got missed.
[06:59] So I thought to tell you on phone, tell mom as well please.
[07:04] OK
[07:05] I am disconnecting phone, I have lot of things to do.
[07:11] Good bye.
[07:42] Hamza often talks about you.
[07:46] He is very worried for you and I can't see my son worried. I want to end the misunderstanding among both of you.
[07:56] He wants to include you in his life.
[08:04] And I don't think that you have ended everything.
[08:07] Man makes mistake.
[08:09] Hamza has made a mistake.
[08:11] Even God doesn't close the door of forgiveness.
[08:21] Hamza made a wrong decision and he is bearing it's burden till date.
[08:25] And now you have made this decision of your engagement, do you want to bear the burden of this wrong decision throughout your life?
[08:31] If a person asks for forgiveness after making mistakes then he should be forgiven.
[09:00] I am not a robot Hamza.
[09:02] I am a living girl who has emotions and feelings but you neither took care for those earlier nor you are taking care of those now.
[09:14] You want me to do whatever you want.
[09:17] If you leave me then I wait for you and if you come back then you find me at the same place where you had left me.
[09:23] Why do you think like that? Tell me.
[09:28] It's my life, whether I settle it or ruin it, who the hell are you?
[09:37] Change your habit of making fun of me everywhere.
[09:41] If you couldn't convince me then you asked your mother to call me.
[09:44] You want me to make relationships and end relationships whenever you want but no, I am not like you.
[10:59] Text message: "I want to talk to you".
[12:08] I am sorry sister Aliya.
[12:14] I said so much in anger but I realized it later that I was wrong.
[12:24] Have you got the tickets?
Yes
[12:30] OK, fine.
[12:35] Sister Aliya
[12:38] You didn't forgive me. I am really embarrassed what I said.
[12:52] No, it maybe my mistake as well. I should have taken care.
[12:58] Anyway, just forget it as past. Just think about your trip and nothing else.
[13:04] It's enough that you have realized your mistake.
[13:08] No, please say that you have forgiven me.
[13:11] Falak
[13:13] There is nothing bad for you in my heart.
[13:19] You are like Kabir to me.
[13:22] I never thought about separating you and Kabir or make both of you unhappy.
[13:28] I know that.
[13:31] The small and big worries in life teach man, what to say at which place and at which time? Hmm?
[13:39] I will be careful next time.
[13:43] I am sure.
[14:15] Hamza
[14:19] Hey, I am waiting for so long. Have breakfast.
I am not hungry.
[14:25] And don't wait for me on dinner, I might get late at night.
[14:28] Why? Are you angry with me?
[14:31] Why are you running away from me? If mother won't get worried for her son then who else will be worried?
[14:37] It's OK if you are worried but your way of getting worried is not right.
[14:43] What do you mean? What have I done?
[14:46] Why did you talk to Nawal?
[14:48] I forbade you that she is engaged now and she don't want to live with me.
[14:53] My son.
[14:55] If children insist on something then it's not necessary that their insistence is appropriate.
[15:00] I wanted to advise her that in the battle of egos the loser is the one who is more egoistic.
[15:06] I felt it appropriate to advise her and I don't have any embarrassment for that.
[15:11] Why would you be embarrassed, in fact I got embarrassed in front of her.
[15:15] She thought that I asked you to talk to her. You have embarrassed me more in front of here unknowingly.
[15:22] Why did you do that?
[15:29] Hamza
[16:00] If you couldn't convince then you asked your mother to call me.
[16:15] If children insist on something then it's not necessary that their insistence is appropriate.
[16:19] I wanted to advise her that in the battle of egos the loser is the one who is more egoistic.
[16:24] I felt it appropriate to advise her and I don't have any embarrassment for that.
[17:12] What are you doing here?
You are surprised as if I can't come to your home.
[17:21] Greetings aunt.
[17:23] Greetings.
[17:25] I was passing from this route so I thought to ask about your well being.
[17:29] I am fine. I am sorry, I didn't recognize you.
[17:36] My name is Hamza Hashmi. Nawal works in my office.
[17:42] Why are you standing? Please have a seat.
[17:49] Nawal, why are you standing like a statue? Ask about tea.
[17:54] No aunt, there is no need for that.
[17:56] I won't take anything. Time is a bit short.
[18:00] I just wanted to tell Nawal that don't leave this job because of me.
[18:07] I don't want her career to be ruined because of me.
[18:16] Nawal is leaving her job and that too because of you but why?
[18:25] Aunt, I didn't want to discuss this issue in front of you like this but the situation has made it compulsory for me.
[18:37] Hamza before saying anything just remember that some mistakes can't be forgiven, never ever and not in any case.
[18:46] Nawal, whatever happened in past, that maybe wrong.
[18:54] But we can correct the things in future.
[18:58] Hamza just leave from here quietly. I don't want any drama here.
[19:10] Nawal, let him say whatever he wants to say.
[19:15] I want to know, what is going on here? What is this drama?
[19:22] Aunt, me and Nawal like each other.
[19:36] We wanted to get married as well.
[19:38] But I went abroad for business activities.
[19:42] I didn't inform Nawal when I left. And she is so angry that she is not ready to listen to me.
[19:53] I admit that I made mistake.
[19:56] But the mistake is not that big that I should be punished for whole life.
[20:01] Nawal, what is Hamza saying?
[20:10] You hid such a big thing from me. You kept me in dark for so long.
[20:17] Is all of this a joke for you?
[20:19] Held my hand whenever you wanted and left my hand whenever you wanted.
[20:22] You have made my life and my love a joke.
[20:27] At first place you humiliated me in front of whole office and now you have come here. What do you want?
[20:33] Nawal, I would never come here if you didn't resign.
[20:37] You forced me that's why I have come here and talk to aunt.
[20:42] I hate you so much that you can't even imagine.
[20:48] Nawal, please listen to me.
[20:50] Whatever happened between both of you was your past
[20:54] but to discuss such things in front of a mother about her daughter is not an appropriate thing to do.
[21:01] I understand aunt, but I have no other option left except this.
[21:08] Mom, ask him to go from here.
[21:12] Hamza go from here.
And don't come here ever again.
[21:19] Please aunt, you are wise so advise her.
[21:23] She won't be happy with that boy. She is making a wrong decision.
[21:28] The decision which are made in stubborn and egoistically never give happiness.
[21:33] I know it very well that what is better for my daughter or not.
[21:40] Thanks for your advice.
[22:23] What am I doing?
[22:26] You invited her intentionally and now you are trying to get her engaged with me.
[22:31] I understand your whole planning.
[22:33] I know what is right and what is wrong for me. I don't want to do job at the moment.
[22:39] You are my fiance and your decision will effect lives of both of us.
[22:44] Perhaps, you don't have any idea about that.
[23:08] Kabir
[23:10] Get up, will you keep lying? We are going out.
[23:16] We have just arrived and you are talking about going out.
[23:20] Take some rest, we will go after rest.
It's been four hours since our arrival.
[23:25] Stop it, don't make excuses, get up, good boy.
[23:30] Falak
[23:31] I am sleepy, we are on vacations. Let me take some rest then we will go.
[23:36] Kabir we are not here to sleep.
[23:38] Look outside, the weather is so beautiful.
[23:51] It's not more beautiful than you.
Yes you are right.
[23:55] Come on get up, no more excuses.
[23:59] We are here to enjoy. Get up.
[24:02] Get up quickly.
[24:04] You hid such a big thing for so long from me.
[24:08] How can you do this to me?
[24:11] What would I tell you if everything was finished?
[24:15] I don't talk about it to myself.
[24:18] I kept worried for so many years, you kept avoiding me by making excuses.
[24:27] So this was the reason that you are not willing to get married.
[24:31] You should have told me about it. You hurt me so much Nawal.
[24:39] I never treated both of you (sisters) strictly.
[24:44] I took care of your liking and disliking.
[24:47] I educated you and gave you confidence.
[24:49] I never taught you to tell a lie. I don't believe it.
[24:56] How can you hide such a big thing from me?
[24:59] I didn't have courage to face this thing myself then how would I tell you?
[25:05] I wasn't believing that this can happen to me.
[25:10] That Hamza will leave my love for wealth.
[25:18] But then I thought
[25:21] That why do I shed my tears for that person who doesn't give importance to my love so I made myself understand,
[25:28] gathered myself and got busy in work.
[25:36] I am your mother, your friend as well. At least you should have told me.
[25:43] I would stand along side you and gather you.
[25:50] At least I wouldn't have this guilt that you forcefully agreed to accept that proposal because of your stubbornness and ego. No, mom.
[26:01] I have made this decision myself with my own will and I stand with it.
[26:07] Don't you want to keep any relation with Hamza and you are happy with your relation with Asjad?
[26:15] Yes I am happy.
[26:19] If Hamza can leave me once then he can leave me again too.
[26:29] I have complete trust on you and your decision Nawal.
[26:37] I am happy in your happiness.
[26:40] It's your life.
[26:45] So, decision will be yours as well.
[27:19] Where were you my son? I was tired of calling you but why weren't you receiving my calls?
[27:24] I am sorry I was busy in an important meeting. Tell me, is there something important?
[27:28] Surprise.
[27:30] Hey when did you come?
Right now, when aunt was calling you.
[27:35] I am sorry, I couldn't receive call, I was a bit busy.
It's OK, how are you?
[27:39] I am fine, how about you? And how are uncle and aunt?
[27:42] Everyone is fine and I am in front of you, how am I looking? Fit, ain't I?
[27:49] Actually aunt I was so excited to meet you. Do you know, we are meeting after a long time?
[27:55] After eight months.
[27:57] Our last meeting was at sister's house, if I am not wrong?
[28:01] Right, right. Well my son, we are going for dinner, get ready and go with us.
[28:07] I am sorry, I won't be able to go with you because I have an important work to do. Let's meet at night. Excuse me.
[28:19] I think Hamza didn't like my visit.
[28:22] No my child, there is no such thing. Actually work load has increased in office. You know him since childhood.
[28:29] OK, let's go together, we will have fun. Let me bring my bag, we will have a great time. Hmm?
[29:11] What are you looking?
[29:16] You are looking so beautiful.
Yes from my childhood.
[29:27] Well, why are you looking at me like this? Let me do my make up, don't bother me.
[29:34] I am not bothering you. I am just watching you quietly.
[29:39] Can't I see you?
[29:46] Do you know what? You seems like reward of my good deeds.
[29:55] Which I must have done unknowingly.
[29:59] And I have got you in that reward.
[30:04] Really? What if this reward became punishment then?
[30:09] Then I will tell that this punishment should be life long.
[30:13] We will face it together.
We can't back off then.
[30:18] No, it can't happen.
[30:21] I thought and understood.
[30:33] Now look and tell me how am I looking?
[30:37] Beautiful as ever.
[30:39] As I told you that you don't need these temporary supports to look beautiful. You are already
[30:48] Excuse me.
[30:52] It's sister's call.
[31:00] I knew that sister will call me.
[31:03] Greetings sister.
[31:06] Yes, I am fine and Falak is fine as well. Tell me how are you?
[31:14] And what about Hafsa?
[31:17] I am missing her so much as well sister.
[31:20] Falak, I am waiting outside, come out when you get ready. Tell me, where is brother Toqeer?
[31:46] Hamza
[31:48] Actually, I have to meet a few people regarding my research and aunt said that you will take me there.
[31:57] I have to go for an important work. Driver is here, he will drop you.
[32:05] Hey
[32:08] Bring your bag, Hamza will drop you.
I am just coming.
[32:14] What are talking about son? Why don't you have time?
What do you think?
[32:20] Whatever you are doing, Ain't I understanding it?
[32:24] What am I doing?
You have invited her intentionally.
[32:29] And now you are trying to engage her with me. I am understanding your whole planning.
[32:34] I didn't invite her, she has come by herself. She had to work on her thesis.
[32:38] She called me, so I asked her to come. I don't know which planning you are referring?
[32:43] There are so many drivers here, send her with anyone. Why me?
[32:47] My child, she is daughter of my brother, will you send your cousin with driver.
[32:53] What will she say when she go back that we have treated her like strangers.
[32:56] Manage your time, take her wherever she wants to go. Don't send her with drivers.
[33:04] Hey my child, Hamza is taking you.
Shall we go?
[33:10] Let's go.
[33:24] Oh Kabir, all of this is so good and so beautiful.
[33:28] And all of this is much more beautiful because you are with me.
[33:32] So let's a picture.
You have taken one thousand pictures by now.
[33:38] Well, we are here to enjoy, if it's in my authority I take everything with me.
[33:43] I don't know when will we come again?
What do you mean? We will come when you will want.
[33:49] Will you have time for me by avoiding your business activities?
Why won't I have?
[33:54] We will come every month if you say.
Let's take a picture.
[33:59] I can manage that much time for you.
[34:20] Let's take a ten minute break then we will continue. OK
[34:36] Greetings madam.
Javed, pick Hafsa from school today, I will get late.
[34:42] OK madam I will pick her.
Reach there before time. OK bye.
[35:16] Miss Hafsa, I am coming in two minutes.
[35:32] Balloon vendor.
Driver uncle I want to buy balloon.
[35:49] Balloon vendor.
[36:02] Balloon vendor.
[37:28] I am sure that you must have talked about Azfar's job.
[37:33] Actually, I have resigned.
[37:39] What? You resigned? So suddenly?
[37:45] Yes there were some problems with management. I am sorry I won't be able to help regarding Azfar.
[37:53] You resigned from such a good job?
[37:57] Problems arise everywhere.
[37:59] I don't understand that people get job after so much difficulty these days and you resigned from such a good job yourself.
[38:08] Yes, I don't want to do job.
[38:11] You don't want to do job, but why?
[38:14] I mean if we both will earn then we can live our life comfortably and we can save money as well.
[38:21] One person's earning is not sufficient these days.
[38:26] So you want me to do job and bear household expenses as well.
[38:31] Of course, there is no harm in that.
[38:34] If two persons are sharing their lives with each other then why can't they share expenses?
[38:42] Nawal you know market condition, good jobs are very rare.
Yes I know.
[38:50] I believe that if one door is closed then others open up.
[38:54] Whatever, you shouldn't leave that job. At least you should have consulted with me.
[39:02] Why would I consult you Asjad?
[39:05] I can make decisions of my life.
[39:07] And I know what is right and what is wrong. And I don't want to do job at the moment.
[39:12] You are my fiance, your every decision will effect lives of both of us, maybe you don't have an idea about it.
[39:20] I have just started an IT company.
[39:23] I need your support.
[39:26] Both morally and financially.
[39:29] I thought that I will ask you to take loan from your company.
[39:32] I need a huge investment.
[39:37] How will arrange such a big amount now?
[39:42] What happened? Won't you have lunch?
[39:44] You have given me such a good news now there is no room for lunch.
