[00:12] You have said so much and I have listened so much. Now listen to me.
[00:17] You wont go out from this house without my permission from now onward. 
[00:21] Otherwise I will treat you in a bad way. 
[00:23] He will recover and will be with us within a few days. 
[00:26] Are you sure Hamza? 
[00:28] Nothing will happen to him?
Nothing. 
[00:30] How long will your anger continue? 
[00:33] Until you promise me that you wont do any act like this again which cause embarrassment to me. Till then.
[00:42] Party? But Maria, it is very difficult for me to go out of house. I wont be able to come.
[00:47] No way, no excuses. This party has been arranged for you. 
[00:52] And there will be no party if you wont come.
[01:02] The post production work is going on regarding the advertisement you have shot.
[01:06] You are looking like barbie doll. I haven't seen such a beautiful look of a new girl
[01:15]  This party has been arranged for you. And there will be no party if you wont come
[01:19] you have to come otherwise the boss will get upset
[01:26] what shall I do? Its important for me to go as well otherwise it will look quite odd
[02:02] hello! such an early morning call. Is everything alright?
[02:05] yes yes, everything is fine Kabir. Its just that I couldn't sleep here properly
[02:10] why, what happened? Are you well?
[02:13] I am almost fine, but you know the environment of my house
[02:17] I am feeling so anxious & suffocated
[02:22] obviously Falak, the matter is as such
[02:25] that's why I was thinking to go for an outing, I should go for some fresh air
[02:30] if you are feeling suffocated then I shall bring you back home
[02:34] No Kabir, what will my sister think? You know the circumstances
[02:40] by the way Kabir my friend had called, tonight is her birthday
[02:45] she was insisting a lot & I had refused at that time. But now I am thinking to go there
[02:51] it will be a change of environment for me
[02:53] Falak, what's with you? There has been an incident in the house, yet you are thinking about going to the party
[02:59] just think, if Nawal or aunt Sultana will get to know then how much hurt they'll feel
[03:04] there is no need to
[03:06] but Kabir, at least listen to me
[03:07] Falak, I have already said no. Ok I am getting late, we'll talk later. Ok
[03:31] Nawal, I don't understand anything at all. What has happened!
[03:36] I had never felt so helpless in my life ever
[03:41] my sister is in a deep grief
[03:44] but I am unable to do anything
[03:48] what kind of test is this?
[03:49] The one who has put you in this test will take you out of it as well
[03:53] Just be patient
[03:57] the wound is quite big, and it will take time to recover. How is Naveen?
[04:02] She is quite disturbed, as if she is unable to understand anything
[04:07] she has become very quiet
[04:11] I feel so hurt whenever I look at her
[04:14] She had never been so quiet, she used to be so mischievous at all times
[04:19] but now she has become so quiet that she doesn't speak at all. She doesn't answers about anything
[04:26] She keeps sitting quietly at one place
[04:29] obviously, being an orphan is such a big grief
[04:34] first the children loose their childhood, then their words & then their dreams
[04:40] but... Hamza, she is quite small right now & your sister is not in such a condition to take care of her
[04:48] you have to handle her
[04:51] Nawal, just pray that I can handle everything. All of this is quite difficult for me
[04:59] I know its difficult. But you have to stay strong
[05:06] for now you are everyone's strength
[06:36] Hi gorgeous! you are looking beautiful
[06:38] Thank you!
[06:40] this is for you!
[06:42] oh my... 
[06:44] by the way Maria, you have done a lot. I haven't become such a big heroine to deserve all this
[06:50] don't you worry, I will make you a top heroine
[06:54] by the way, shall I tell you one thing? I have met a producer
[06:57] and he is looking for a new face
[07:00] who is he? What is the system? How does it work?
[07:03] Wait, why are you so impatient? Shall I reveal everything now?
[07:07] Come, let me introduce you to everyone
yes yes
[07:12] is everything set?
[07:16] Mr. Shirazi, I have to take this call. Its very important
[07:21] Please, you go I am coming
Ok
[07:25] Hello! yes
[07:59] Greetings Mr. Shirazi, you are here?
[08:02] we are here for the dinner but for sure you are doing your magazine's annual party
[08:07] absolutely correct! Please come join us
[08:10] No, you people enjoy. I have an official dinner
[08:13] oh sir, give us some time. Let me introduce you to our new model
[08:17] Okay come
[08:20] this one looks good
[08:23] she is Ms. Falak, our new model. And top heroine of the industry in the coming time
[08:29] he is Mr. Shirazi, a reknown businessman of this country
[08:34] oh Ms. Falak, how are you?
[08:36] I feel so happy to meet you
[08:39] do you guys know each other?
[08:40] yes yes, there was a bit of introduction. Rest is done now
[10:40] Kabir, listen to me
[10:44] I don't want to listen to you at all!
[10:47] any new lie?
[10:50] Kabir!
I had forbidden you!
[10:53] I had forbidden you, right? 
Still you had gone
[10:55] why I wouldn't have gone if the party was kept in my honor?
[10:58] the party was in your honor & you had told me that its Anum's birthday
[11:02] you had lied to me here as well!
[11:04] as if I would have got the permission after telling the truth
[11:06] you have no guilt at all?
[11:09] guilt for what, Kabir? for what?
[11:13] people were recognizing me, knowing me.. they were giving me respect
[11:15] Respect! Is this what you call respect?
[11:19] is this respect for you?
[11:21] a stranger man was keeping a hand on your shoulder, and you were smiling & laughing
[11:26] were you liking all this?
[11:28] do you want this freedom? Is this what you want to do?
[11:31] Kabir, you aren't understanding anything. This is my career!
[11:34] you have a problem with everyone. On what more you will object?
[11:37] I will object on that every matter which I don't like
[11:40] I will object on that every matter!
[11:42] I have an objection with this attire of yours, with this work of yours!
[11:47] and from those people of yours. I have an objection!
[11:51] you cannot do this to me! I feel suffocated in this house
[11:54] Shut up! Even after all this if I am tolerating you right now then its just because of our baby
[12:03] otherwise, today you have broken my trust & belief everything!
[12:07] you have shattered it
[12:10] Falak, if you did it again
[12:14] then I am telling you, i will forget this relation. I mean it!
[12:20] I won't tolerate a single mistake
[12:23] Remember! 
Move aside... 
[13:00] Hello!
[13:01] where have you been? Why you didn't come home as of yet? I have been waiting for you since so long
[13:06] mom, I have come back to my house. I will talk to you later
[13:08] hey Falak.. hello!
[13:24] what hospital! How is she now?
[13:28] much better
[13:30] but... we are unable to handle her
[13:33] the grief of becoming a widow in such a young age is quite big
[13:37] may God bless Nzish with strength & courage
[13:40] Ameen
[13:43] my heart feels so hurt whenever I see her
[13:48] her life will be so harsh in the future
[13:51] we fear about our daughter's fate
[13:55] what to do? Just pray
[13:59] we parents give everything to our daughters
[14:02] its just that we cannot give any guarantee of their happiness, sister Sofia
[14:08] I know you must be so worried because the wedding got postponed
[14:12] but don't worry, We'll come back soon after solving the matters here
[14:18] don't worry, God will have mercy
[14:22] actually I wanted to make a request to you
[14:26] Can we extend the wedding for next 6 months?
[14:31] 6 months! But 6 months time period is a lot
[14:35] it would be better if you could have arranged it after the completion of Nazish's iddat (waiting period after husband's death)
[14:40] even we have thought about the same thing.
[14:42] but her condition is so bad, we will be able to think about other things once her trauma lessens a bit
[14:48] Okay, as you find better
[14:52] may God bless Nazish with good health & strength
[14:55] Ameen
[14:57] just pray that my daughter gets patience
[14:59] God willing, He will bless her with patience. Don't worry
[15:05] talk to you later, bye!
[15:08] Bye!
[15:56] Kabir
[15:57] yes sister?
[16:02] you had told me that Falak has gone to Dubai for vacations with her friends
[16:08] Yes, she had gone with her friends
[16:12] but Kabir... what is this?
[16:54] Falak
[16:58] you did a shoot in Dubai?
[17:02] what happened Kabir, is everything fine?
[17:03] answer me about what I am asking, did you get the shoot done or not?
[17:10] yes, I did
[17:12] although I had forbidden you
[17:14] what I could do? Should I have got the contract canceled?
[17:17] is that contract more important to you than our relation?
[17:20] I don't understand, what is your problem!
[17:23] why are you joining two separate matters? Its just a shoot, what's the big deal?
[17:27] its a big deal Falak. It is a big deal!
[17:33] for me my relation is important
[17:36] and a relation where there is no trust, that relation is hollow
[17:41] what do you want to say?
[17:43] I want to say that you have broken my trust & belief
[17:47] You have to choose any one thing between our relation & your career
[18:06] Kabir
[18:09] the decision is yours
[18:12] Kabir!... Kabir
[18:17] Kabir
[18:19] what are you saying, do you have an idea?
[18:21] do you have an idea? Do you realize about it?
[18:25] I have become fed-up of your lies & self-will
[18:29] you have become fed-up? Fed-up of me?
[18:31] Yes, I have become fed-up of your foolishness
[18:37] but I won't tolerate it anymore
[18:39] Fine, then I shall also know that what is going on in your mind
[18:43] I have already told you whatever is there in my mind
[18:46] go inside, go inside the room!
[18:48] why will I go inside the room?
[18:50] you have said such a big thing to me, and now you want me to so & sit quietly inside the room!
[18:57] oh my God! why all of this is happening with me
[19:04] Falak, don't exaggerate the matter
[19:09] am I exaggerating the matter, or you are?
[19:12] what wrong have I done by thinking that I can also spend my life as per my choice? I can also breathe freely
[19:18] and I never used to think of you like this. I had given you so much of honor & love.. and you!
[19:25] you are threatening to divorce me just because I hadn't listened to you
[19:33] everyone does everything of their choice in this house, nobody questions them
[19:38] but anyone can come to question Falak & to insult her
[19:43] all of you want Falak to spend her life according to you, as if I am a puppet
[19:51] what happened Falak, what are you saying?
[19:55] I have gone mad! All of you have made me go crazy
[19:59] control yourself! Kabir, what as such you have said to her?
[20:03] leave it sister, you will also side him
[20:07] you will favor him as well
[20:10] He is talking about leaving me because I did 2 advertisements without telling me. He wants to divorce me
[20:18] sister, I haven't said any such thing
[20:21] I haven't said any such thing. Why are you exaggerating the matter uselessly?
[20:25] have some God fear, have mercy on me Kabir
[20:29] you have threatened me about divorce, you want to leave me. Is this a small matter?
[20:33] my life has been ruined
[20:37] you really like to create a scene, right?
[20:41] Fine! Let me say it now
[20:44] if you will not listen to me Falak, then I can do this as well
[20:50] Kabir! what is this way to talk? And what has happened to you?
[20:55] I have tried all the ways, brother
[20:57] I have become confused, I don't understand what to do
[21:01] I have become fed-up of her dramas
[21:05] Kabir... Kabir!
[21:10] Falak, control yourself. Lets go inside your room
[21:14] I don't need anyone's sympathies. Let it be
[21:27] Don't know for what he was angry. He was about to raise his hand on me
[21:33] sister, till date I have tolerated her each & every mistake
[21:37] but honestly speaking, I don't have anymore patience left in me
[21:48] granny, where my father has gone? I want to go with him
[22:04] dear, your father is no more in this world
[22:07] he has gone to God
[22:09] why dad has gone to God?
[22:12] why he didn't took me along?
[22:15] my dear, no... you shouldn't say like this
[22:17] See, your granny is here and if you will also go then I will become alone. So somebody has to be there with me, right?
[22:24] Okay? my dear
[22:29] I have talked to Ms. Sultana, I have asked her to postpone the wedding date
[22:34] presently Nazish is not in a good condition
[22:37] She said, we can do it after the completion of her iddat (waiting period after husband's death)
[22:40] but I said No
[22:42] she would be needing some time, and we'll think about it once she gets recovered
[22:48] if you talk to Nawal then explain her as well. After all, you know the entire situation
[22:55] yes
[23:16] he belongs to a very nice family, he is very well-educated
[23:19] also he will take his wife abroad after wedding, I am thinking to invite them to our house
[23:24] this way we'll be able to see the guy as well
[23:26] Wow mom! I must say invite them this Sunday. We'll enjoy a lot on sister Nawal's wedding
[23:38] mom
[24:06] coming dear
[24:18] mom...
yes
[24:20] why are you crying?
[24:24] I had so much of desire for your wedding
[24:30] but what games destiny plays, Nawal
[24:34] what a person thinks & what happens
[24:39] mom... everything doesn't happen in our life as per our choice
[24:45] and then you had said to me that, maybe there is some betterment in it
[24:49] So after making me courageous, now you are being hopeless
[24:58] don't worry, nothing will happen
[25:05] yes Falak
[25:10] are you crying? What happened?
[25:16] Falak, tell me what is the matter?
[25:18] sister Nawal, quickly come here with mom
[25:24] Okay we are coming, but at least tell me what had happened
[25:27] No, just come quickly
[25:31] what is she saying, what happened?
[25:33] I don't know, she is just asking us to come over. She was crying a lot
[25:38] oh God! Have mercy... what had happened
[25:59] yes dear, tell me
[26:02] what is the problem?
[26:04] I am thinking that sister is much better now
[26:09] So, if I can visit Pakistan
[26:12] there are a few important meetings. also you are here as well. So I don't think so that there will be any problem
[26:19] as you find better. But come back soon
[26:24] now you will handle Raheel's properties & business over here
[26:29] yes I know
[26:32] don't worry, I will handle everything
[26:34] I will come back within a week
[26:38] but ask her, whether she wants to live here or to shift to Pakistan with us
[26:42] No, what's there to ask about? She will go back with us, how will she stay here alone? She has no one here
[26:47] hmm... true that
[26:49] but I think, still you should ask her once. Its important to know her consent
[26:56] I will talk to her
[26:59] If Kabir had an objection on Falak's modeling then why did he allow him in the first place?
[27:05] he should have refused her. And what was the need of all this ruckus?
[27:09] Kabir had an objection since beginning, maybe Falak hadn't told you
[27:13] Impossible! Falak can never take such a big step without Kabir's permission
[27:20] I had wed off my daughter in your family by considering that you people are well educated
[27:26] I didn't had an idea that you people are so conservative
[27:31] otherwise, I wouldn't have married my daughter in your family
[27:37] look at her condition
[27:41] is Kabir's behavior appropriate in this condition?
[27:46] what if something would have happened to her then? I am taking my daughter with me
[27:49] See, I don't think so that its appropriate
[27:52] you may take Falak with you on some other day, but please don't take her today
[27:56] Kabir has threatened to divorce Falak
[28:01] are you getting the meaning of it?
[28:06] my daughter is not an orphan that anyone can treat her as per their choice. And what do you think, that nobody will be there to speak for her?
[28:12] See, I request you. Please don't be angry
[28:15] nobody has said anything to her
[28:18] both of them had a small fight, and Kabir had said this to her in anger
[28:22] but he didn't mean it really
[28:26] I think we shouldn't exaggerate this small matter
[28:30] small matter? Do you find it a small matter?
[28:34] can you see Falak's condition?
[28:36] I accept that whatever Kabir did is wrong. Also, he is guilty about it
[28:43] but see, whatever problem they have in between them it doesn't mean that she shall go with you
[28:49] the solution of it is that Falak shall accept whatever Kabir is saying
[28:54] See, there are a lot of matters in a husband & a wife relation and we have to tolerate them patiently
[29:03] and have to do compromises too
[29:05] also we have to accept so many things unwillingly
[29:10] if you want to take Falak along with you, then taker her along for a few days
[29:17] and explain her that, if she needs to save any one thing between a family & career...
[29:23] then she should save her family
[29:26] only that's a wise decision
[29:46] i don't know what has happened to Kabir. He has become so annoying
[29:51] He fights on every other matter, he was never like that
[29:55] he used to love me a lot
[29:58] don't know what has happened to him
[30:00] why didn't you tell me all these things before?
[30:04] everything was fine earlier, but don't know what had happened to him all of a sudden
[30:09] he has a problem with everything. I can't do anything without his permission
[30:13] and now I have to breathe as per his will. I feel so suffocated, mom
[30:20] Falak, a lot had happened & you are telling us now?
[30:25] how I would have told you, sister?
[30:28] your marriage got postponed, you guys are already so worried
[30:31] I didn't wanted to make you guys more worried by telling all this
[30:34] even now I wouldn't have told you guys, If Kabir hadn't threatened me for the divorce
[30:40] the limit! What we had thought about this family & how they have proved to be
[30:44] what shall I tell you mom? Don't know for what he was angry. He was about to raise his hand on me
[30:52] what!
[30:56] what are you saying, Falak? Kabir was about to slap you?
[31:03] why didn't you tell me this matter over there? I would have talked to them there & then
[31:09] Get up! Nawal, take out the car. Let me go & clear this matter right away
[31:13] mom, please let it be. There is no use of this matter now, it will be exaggerated for no reason
[31:18] let it get exaggerated, what is left now?
[31:22] We have to discuss it with them, what do they think of us?
[31:25] mom, let it be. This is the reason I don't tell such matters to you people
[31:30] you people will also think that its Kabir's fault
[31:32] In fact, its not Kabir's issue... everything is done by sister Aliya
[31:37] She keeps provoking Kabir against me, also she keeps talking weird things
[31:45] Besides, what will you talk about? You will talk to her, & she will refuse
[31:50] that's why I am telling you that there is no use of going there. Let it be
[31:53] Okay don't cry, we'll talk about it
[32:01] Kabir
[32:06] Ms. Sultana came after your had left
[32:09] she took away Falak with her
[32:11] what!
[32:13] the way you had talked to Falak, she got into so much of stress. 
You shouldn't have talked to her so loudly
[32:19] sister, till date I have tolerated her each & every mistake
[32:23] but honestly speaking, I don't have anymore patience left in me
[32:26] I am also a human, after all until when I can tolerate all this?
[32:30] See, the matter can be discussed within manners too. Its not necessary to get hyper in every matter
[32:37] if not for yourself, then at least control your anger for your child
[32:43] because if you guys will keep fighting like this, then it will incur a loss to you
[32:47] Also the life of the upcoming baby will be ruined
[33:15] why did you come to pick me?
[33:17] the driver would have picked me
[33:19] why will the driver come when I am here to pick you
[33:22] that's why I wasn't telling you
[33:24] No, you did very well by telling me
[33:28] I can't express how happy I am feeling after seeing you, after such a long time. My heart feels so relieved
[33:36] me too
[33:42] how is your sister now?
[33:46] how can she be?
[33:48] she is little better
[33:51] and Naveen?
[33:52] Naveen has become quite scared
[33:54] she is such a small child, and she saw everything from her eyes
[33:59] she is so frightened that gets up in the middle of the night
[34:01] obviously, it will take some time for her to come out of this trauma
[34:06] but God willing, she will be better with time
[34:10] I hope so
[34:12] Nawal, do you know sister was crying so badly while hugging me when I was coming here
[34:18] I think she is quite scared
[34:21] she thinks that everything is slipping from her hands like a sand
[34:26] Hamza, give her courage & strength
[34:31] explain her that there isn't any of her fault in it, all of these things are destined to happen
[34:36] but I become so helpless, whenever I go in front of her
[34:42] I don't understand, what shall I talk about. What do I tell her
[34:46] I had never seen a single tear in her eyes in my entire life
[34:51] and now, her eyes are full of tears at all times
[35:19] Kabir, today you came early from office?
[35:23] yes sister, there wasn't much work in the office. I just did a few visits that's it!
[35:29] then I came home, because I don't feel like sitting in the office
[35:33] sister, can you please get me a cup of tea?
[35:36] Sure... 
Noor... Noor!
[35:40] yes
[35:41] Noor, make a nice cup of tea for brother Kabir. In fact make 2 cups, I will also drink along with him
[35:46] Okay
[35:47] sister, what is this?
[35:49] These are Falak's medicines & a few necessary items
[35:53] she forgot to took them along in a hurry, so I thought of going & giving it to her
[35:57] since you are back now, so you can go & this way you can inquire about Falak's well being as well. Okay?
[36:06] No sister, I am having a headache
[36:09] in fact, you also don't need to go as well.
[36:11] if the things are very important then ask the driver, he will deliver it to her
[36:59] Falak, there is a limit of everything. Where are you lost?
[37:03] we have given the dates for the shoot, I am getting continuous calls. And you are not here.
[37:08] I'm so sorry Maria, actually I was a bit unwell therefore I am at my mom's place
[37:15] presently, I cannot get the shoots done
[37:17] can you please extend the dates, can you manage it?
[37:21] Falak, what will you do in the future if you are doing this right now?
