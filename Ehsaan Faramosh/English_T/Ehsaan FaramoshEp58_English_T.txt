[01:14] These are the initial stages, as soon as we move further, our profit will increase.
[01:20] This is enough for me.
[01:22] Its after such a long time that I've had a good news.
[01:29] Thank you so much Nawal.
[01:32] Its the result of your hard work.
[01:35] Its all our hard work. Why are you praising me alone?
[01:41] So Qaiser called me and he said he wanted to invest in real estate.
[01:46] He does have big investors but he wants us to lead.
[01:50] Even I want to do that.
[01:52] But the problem is that we don't have such a big investment and right now
[01:57] and I don't want to do anything that's risky.
[02:04] Okay. Understood. However, I talked to Mr. Hamdani's manager.
[02:09] He wants to invest in our food business.
[02:12] They asked for a meeting but I took time to think.
[02:16] If we collaborate with them, we can get good profits.
[02:21] I personally don't know Mr. Hamdani much.
[02:25] If you're okay with it, we can move things ahead.
[02:29] He's a very good human being with a good business acumen. My experience says it
[02:34] I was working with Mr. Shirazi when he did a project with Hamdani and Co.
[02:39] Everything went smoothly. There was no problems.
[02:43] My experience says we should have a partnership with them because if they invest in our food business,
[02:49] then we can invest in real estate. He'll help us and we'll help them.
[02:54] But where will the investment come from? That's the actual problem.
[02:58] We'll get the investment, let me talk first.
[03:01] Alright. You can talk.
[03:05] Thank you Kabeer. Your trust boosts my confidence.
[03:11] Nawal this company is as much yours as its mine.
[03:19] And I have complete believe that you'll decide for its best interest.
[03:25] If God wills.
[03:26] As God wills.
[03:39] sister
[03:45] Your attitude with Falak isn't good at all. Why are you treating her this way?
[03:51] Am I mistreating her? She is misbehaving with me.
[03:56] Whats your problem? Why don't you let us live in peace in this house?
[04:03] What do you want? Should I take Falak and leave from this house?
[04:07] I do not want this at all Hamza. You're my only brother.
[04:13] Why would I want you to leave this house?
[04:16] Really? Then why did you tell Falak that if you withdrew your share from this business and this house, I'll be on the road.
[04:27] What does this mean? Explain me.
[04:33] See Hamza, if your wife will come and argue with me
[04:39] and point out my worth, I'll be forced to answer.
[04:45] It would be best if you make your wife understand and tell her to stay away from my matters.
[05:14] So these amounts are fine?
[05:16] Yes I've written them myself.
[05:19] Check it one more time.
[05:23] Did you fill in the quotations here?
[05:25] Yes.
[05:26] Look at them carefully. Not a single amount is correct.
[05:40] Hamza you should have talked calmly in front of her.
[05:44] Falak only two three days are left for us to fill in this tender.
[05:49] How long have you been working on it? Do you have any idea how much loss I could incur?
[05:54] Whats wrong with it? I filled in the amounts correctly.
[05:58] Yes only on the first page. Check the second page.
[06:02] Somewhere you've given a smaller amount and somewhere its bigger. Check further,
[06:06] there is no amount mentioned. Is this how you fill a tender?
[06:12] Falak, the documents are also not complete. Will you work like this?
[06:17] Is this how our company will get the tender?
[06:24] Falak the way you've filled in the quotations, nobody will even think about giving our company the tender.
[06:33] Hamza relax. I'll do it.
[06:36] I briefed them correctly but any staff member could make a mistake. I'll check it.
[06:43] Falak this tender is for Hamdani and Co and its very important for me.
[06:48] I want this tender at all costs. Understand?
[06:54] Hamza we will get this tender. Don't worry. I'll see to everything.
[06:59] Please Falak.
[07:00] Work on it seriously and correct it as soon as possible.
[07:32] Nazish what are you thinking? I told you earlier to take over the business. Its yours.
[07:39] You have to run it and if not for yourself, you'll have to be strong for your daughter, dear.
[07:47] Mom, I will not be able to do it, please.
[07:52] Why not? Didn't you use to go to the office earlier?
[07:55] Mom see, earlier it was different earlier. Raheel was there then.
[07:59] All the responsibilities were his. I just helped out.
[08:04] Now Raheel isn't around. You'll have to take the responsibility.
[08:09] You'll have to decide today or tomorrow.
[08:14] No matter how much we try, we cannot compete with Falak's hypocrisy.
[08:22] And ever since Hamza has threatened us that he'll take Falak and leave,
[08:28] think if he leaves and takes your business along. Where will you be then?
[08:34] Mom I was good staying in Canada. You people wanted me to come to Pakistan in a haste.
[08:43] You should have let me be there.
[08:46] Dear you were not well and I was worried about you. I brought you here so that you could be stable.
[08:52] Whats wrong with me? I'm fine now, mom.
[08:56] But we have disease named Falak now.
[09:01] Dear I didn't ever think he'll bring a monster in our house.
[09:08] Oh well, its not late. We can prepare for the times to come.
[09:18] I'm with you dear. I'll ask the lawyer and he'll prepare the papers.
[09:23] I'll support you & take care of you dear. Be strong.
[09:50] What does Hamza think?
[09:52] If he leaves you, will you spoil your life and cry after him? No.
[09:59] This engagement being off will not make a difference to you. You'll not kill yourself.
[10:05] Keep on doing what you've been doing. Take care of your responsibilities.
[10:17] You're in such a deep thought.
[10:22] Nothing I was just thinking..
[10:29] when a person has honest intentions, how much God helps him.
[10:35] Yes, I believe that.
[10:39] I have a meeting with Mr. Hamdani tomorrow, I was thinking that if he's interested in investing in our business,
[10:48] then we'll fill in their tender. How much amount will be enough?
[10:58] Its a risk..
[11:02] See if we suffer a loss this time,
[11:09] we won't be able to stand up again.
[11:11] To succeed and move ahead, we need to take a risk.
[11:20] Okay, fine.
[13:33] This year, like always, we have received a lot of tenders.
[13:38] However, the most impressive of tenders came from a new company.
[13:47] We didn't expect them to focus on all the details so minutely.
[13:52] This will be the first project of that company.
[13:55] And we expect that they'll not let us down.
[13:58] The name of that company is Sultana and Co.
[14:26] The CEO of that company is Ms. Nawal. Congratulations Ms. Nawal.
[14:31] Its a great achievement for you and your company.
Thank you, sir.
[15:50] So finally, you have won.
[15:55] Congratulations mam.
[15:58] Thank you.
[16:00] Nawal I have a call. Excuse me. I'm waiting in the car.
[16:04] Alright.
Hello?
[16:07] I'm very impressed. The way you filled in quotations and took care of the minute details.
[16:13] It'll be fun working with you.
I'm also looking forward to working with you.
[16:16] Thank you mam.
Thank you.
[16:20] Listen to me.
Hamza, leave my hand!
[16:26] I thought you two will drown out of shame
[16:32] but the two of you have no shame at all.
[16:34] Mind your tongue, Hamza.
[16:40] You told me you had no affair with Kabeer.
[16:46] So? You didn't like him at all. So why did you get married?
[16:55] Why did you do this to me? You lied to me.
[17:00] If you didn't want to keep any relation with me, why did you entrap me with your love?
[17:06] Answer me.
[17:07] I don't want to answer you. There's no use giving you clarifications.
[17:13] Do you know there was a time I thought I was wrong?
[17:22] I was mistaken about your affair with Kabeer and that you were telling me the truth.
[17:33] But when I heard the news of yours and Kabeer's wedding. I believed.
[17:41] Everything you said and swore upon, was a lie.
[17:54] But you know what?
[17:58] I'm happy that my eyes opened at the right time.
[18:04] I found your real face. God knows what would happen to me?
[18:10] What would people say about me? I wouldn't have been able to show my face to anyone.
[18:19] On one side, it was I, Hamza Hashim and on the other side, it was my fiance and her character..
[18:25] No.. No..
[18:27] I'm grateful that I didn't marry a person like you.
[18:31] What if someone had told you something about me and you had trusted them?
[18:37] What would become of me or where would I go then?
[18:40] Thank God, He saved me.
[18:43] You know my mom always said, matches are made in heaven.
[18:48] A person only gets a life partner like he is, himself.
[18:51] Yes, definitely. It did hurt in the beginning.
[18:55] But Kabeer made up all the pain I had received.
[18:59] You and Falak deserve each other, in all manners.
[19:05] This confidence that you have, I'll take it all away from you.
[19:12] I will never let you do this project.
[19:18] I'll bother you so much,
[19:20] that you'll be forced to leave this project.
[19:25] I'll destroy the remaining reputation that the two of you have.
[19:31] I am just waiting for that time.
[19:36] I knew you were so cheap. You cannot tolerate someone's success and their happiness.
[19:41] Its written on your face and I can see it in your body language,
[19:44] that you're in a lot of pain. You don't like it. You cannot tolerate it.
[19:50] But your wish will remain unfulfilled.
[19:53] Because I will complete this project, by the will of God!
[20:47] Nawal, what is it? Why are you so quiet?
[20:53] Did something happen?
[20:56] I met Hamza on my way out.
[20:59] He threatened me that he wouldn't let me work on this project. He said he'd keep bothering us.
[21:08] Don't worry. He cannot do anything. And I'm with you.
[21:17] Nobody can harm you while I'm with you. I'll not let them hurt you.
[22:05] I'm thankful that I didn't get to marry a guy like you or else I'd have spent my life hanging.
[22:12] If someone had said something to you about me and you'd have trusted them,
[22:15] what would happen to me? Where would I go?
[23:19] My mom would always say that matches are made in heaven.
[23:23] We get a life partner like we are.
[23:26] Definitely, it did hurt in the beginning.
[23:29] But Kabeer was a payback for all that pain.
[25:06] The company's tender that was the best is a new company.
[25:11] We didn't expect them to focus on such minute details.
[25:15] So guys the name of that company is Sultana and Co and the ceo of that company is Ms. Nawal.
[25:59] Whose responsibility was it? You people's.
[26:06] I told you that I wanted this tender at all costs.
[26:11] Do you realize how much of a loss I've incurred because I didn't get the tender?
[26:22] Who was leading the project?
[26:24] Sir Ms. Falak was leading it.
[26:33] So you people had some responsibilities too!
[26:38] If she was making mistakes in the paper, you must have seen it.
[26:44] Why didn't you correct the mistakes?
[26:48] Answer me.
[26:50] Sir I had pointed out everything to Ms. Falak
[26:53] and I told her that she had filled the rates incorrectly in some places but,
[26:59] she didn't listen to me. She said she'd get everything done and I shouldn't worry.
[27:05] I was trying for this project for the past six months.
[27:11] And someone else took it. You people should drown and die.
[27:15] Do you even realize how much embarrassed I am because of you people?
[27:19] Sir even we're upset about it.
[27:21] We wanted the tender as well but its not our fault.
[27:27] Ms. Falak didn't even listen to us.
[27:30] Although I told her to give me the responsibility but she didn't agree.
[27:38] If you don't believe me, you can ask anybody from the staff.
[27:46] You can check the email I sent you. It has all the details.
[28:00] Alright. You people can leave.
[28:39] Hamza, what happened? Why are you stressed?
[28:45] Don't you know why I'm stressed?
[28:49] We tried our best but whatever God had planned, happened.
[28:55] But I have complete faith that Nawal and Kabeer must have bribed them.
[29:01] Otherwise who is so stupid,
[29:04] to give such a big tender to a new company. Out of the question.
[29:07] I know Mr. Hamdani and his team very well. They work on merit.
[29:12] And the people who don't fulfill their merit, they reject them. Like they rejected us.
[29:17] Hamza..
[29:18] Stop it Falak. Don't blame others for your own mistakes. Its all because of you.
[29:24] What do you want to say?
[29:28] Didn't the manager tell you about your mistakes that cost us the tender?
[29:34] Did you make corrections?
[29:35] Hamza I..
Don't lie to me now.
[29:39] Do you even realize how much this non serious attitude of yours have made me lose?
[29:43] Why are you holding me responsible for all this?
[29:46] You were the one leading it. So aren't you responsible?
[29:51] Kabeer, Nawal, Mr. Hamdani.. I was embarrassed in front of everyone. Just because of you.
[30:03] The guy who saw me as a mountain, you berated me like a penny.
[30:09] I cannot even look them in the eye.
[30:14] You know what? I shouldn't have offered you a job. I made a mistake.
[30:22] You will not go to the office from tomorrow. I've appointed a new finance officer in your place.
[30:28] How can you do this Hamza?
What else can I do?
[30:31] You cannot handle the matters. Do I have another choice?
[30:35] You're doing wrong. I'm telling you.
[30:38] Will you insult me because you didn't get a tender?
[30:41] What will people do? They'll say a lot of things and ridicule me.
[30:45] How can you give my place to someone else?
[30:49] Had someone else gotten the tender, I wouldn't have been so angry.
[30:53] But Kabeer and Nawal got it and I hate them most in the world.
[31:40] Ilham was sick. I was calling you since long but your phone was off.
[31:45] So it wasn't the end of the world? You were there, you took her.
[31:48] And as it is, I take care of her whole day. She's your daughter as well Kabeer, what if you took care of her for a day.
[31:53] Rather than accepting your mistake, you're accusing me?
[31:57] Enough Kabeer. Enough. Its been too much.
[32:00] I'm your wife, not a servant. I have a life. Do you want me to sit at home?
[32:07] There's a limit to everything and next time you'll not cross your limits!
[32:31] Kabeer? Why are you standing here?
[32:34] Just like that..
[32:37] Why are you awake?
[32:38] I don't know how I slept while making Ilham sleep.
[32:44] I'll get you some tea.
[32:58] Nawal.. Its because of you I'm so happy today. After such a long time.
[33:06] I'm very happy. I'm so happy that I cannot describe it.
[33:15] If I tell the truth, I feel I've become very tall today.
[33:23] This is all because of you. Only you.
[33:28] Its not only my hard work.
[33:31] Its our hard work..
[33:32] No. Not at all. Its all your hard work. And I have no complexes accepting this today.
[33:41] Don't say like that..
Let me say it today.
[33:48] You know, 
[33:51] I had so many reservations about getting married for the second time. 
[33:56] You proved them all wrong.
[34:02] To tell you the truth,
[34:05]  I was not at all comfortable before I got married. 
[34:10] I'd think that my second wife will come,
[34:13] God knows whether she'd take care of Ilham or not because its a big responsibility.
[34:24] The way you took care of Ilham,
[34:27]  you didn't let her miss her mother. 
[34:31] Trust me, had even Falak been here, she wouldn't have cared for her like this.
[34:37] In fact, she thought Ilham was a burden. Always.
[34:42] I know. I saw everything.
[34:47] But thinking about the past will only hurt us. 
[34:53] Forget what you thought before the wedding.
[34:57] Now we're together and I'm not Falak.
[35:02] You can never be Falak.
[35:04] For me, responsibilities aren't a burden but instead they make me happy.
[35:09]  If you love someone and you can help them, it makes me happy.
[35:19] Agreed. 
[35:23] Thank you.
[35:55] Nazish, I need your signatures on these papers.
[36:00] What are these?
[36:02] I'm starting a new big projects, I need money. 
[36:06] Until you don't sign, I cannot get the amount transferred from Canada.
[36:13] Its such a big amount. What new projects are you starting?
[36:18] I'll tell you everything later, right now I don't have time. I need to reach somewhere fast. Please hurry and sign.
[36:25] I'm sorry Hamza but I cannot sign these.
[36:28] What? But why? What happened?
[36:32] I think you are not focusing on your business like you should.
[36:38] What? What are you trying to say?
[36:43] I talked to them. They've been calling you for many days now and you aren't giving them a time for the meeting.
[36:51] I was busy. You know that.
[36:56] Two production units have been closed there and there is a problem in the production.
[37:01] Clients have filed a case against the company because their consignment wasn't delivered on time. 
[37:06] We'll have to pay a hefty fine, Hamza.
[37:11] Its not your headache, I know everything. 
[37:16] Don't worry. Are you signing or not?
[37:32] Alright. If you want the money, give me details of these projects.
[37:38]  I'll look over the details and give you the money.
[37:52] Okay.
[38:00] You should have signed dear, he'd need those for the projects.
[38:03] Mom you told me to take over my business.
[38:07]  I've decided now. I'll overlook my business, myself.
[38:27] Here's your piping hot tea.
[38:30] Thank you. Did you make it?
[38:33] Yes. With my hands, for you.
[38:36] You should have told me. I would have made it.
[38:39] Its the same thing. Tell me how it is.
[38:47] Even I cannot make such good tea.
[38:49] Seriously? I passed.
[38:53] But next time you'll tell me. Please.
Its okay.
[38:57] Is Ilham still sleeping? 
[38:58] yes
[39:00] She kept us awake all night and now she's sleeping herself.
[39:04] Thank God she slept a little. She's so energetic.
[39:09] I really make good tea.
[39:16] What are you working on?
[39:17] I am working on the presentation we have to show in the meeting tomorrow. Look at it.
[39:25] Good.
[39:27] Only a few things are left. The budgets and all.
