[01:33] Just forgive me, once.
[01:51] Just once.
[03:21] I flew on the skies of your love but I kept my flight in check. 
[03:25] But now that I want to fly high, don't tie me down with your loyalty.
[03:32] Fly as high as you want to.
[03:35] When you come back, you'll find all ways to come back, closed.
[04:20] Falak? You? At this time? 
[04:24] Is everything alright? Are you okay? Sit down.
[04:30] What happened?
[04:32] Aunty threw me out of the house.
[04:35] She threw you out? How could she throw you out?
[04:40] You didn't ask Hamza to do such a cheap thing. Its not your fault.
[04:45] But she feels I made Hamza do this. She thinks I'm the root cause of everything.
[04:52] Even if she thinks so, she cannot say this. 
[04:55] Falak, you should go and talk to Hamza.
[05:04] Its all his fault and everybody is blaming you!
[05:11] I don't understand why are they punishing you?
[05:15]  They should blame the one who is responsible.
[05:24] See, you have the right to ask Hamza why he did, what he did. 
[05:29] At least once.
[05:41] We're giving you a breaking news. The police has arrested business tycoon Hamza Hashim for the kidnap of Kabeer Foods Owner's, Kabeer Salahuddin's daughter.
[05:51] Mom.. thank God you answered. I've been calling you since long. 
[05:56] Your number was busy.
[06:00] I was talking to the lawyer. The police has arrested Hamza.
[06:05] Yes, mom. I saw in the news.
[06:08] I don't believe how Hamza could do such a cheap thing.
[06:14] Falak trapped him and made him do this. He could never do such a thing.
[06:19] Yes, Falak must have made him do it. But Hamza isn't a child.
[06:22]  Even if Falak asked him. He could say no.
[06:28] Falak isn't the only one at fault. Even Hamza is responsible.
[06:32] Mom, don't worry. I told you I'm coming.
[06:36] We'll get him out.
[06:40] He's my son. How could I not worry? 
[06:43] You know what the lawyers said? They said the punishment is four years for this.
[06:48] Mom, nothing will happen, I said. Let me come. We'll not let Hamza stay in for so long.
[06:56] And where is Falak?
I threw her out.
[07:03] You did good. She deserved it.
[07:10] Alright mom, don't worry. Take care. I'll hang up now. Bye.
[08:09] What did you do Hamza? Why did you do it?
[08:20] I don't believe it. 
[08:24] You were my pride..
[08:29] You were my pride and today I have to see this day because of you.
[08:38] Is this how you pay me back for all my love and upbringing?
[08:51] Why Hamza? Where did I lack in your upbringing?
[08:59] Why did you show me this day?
[09:06] I brought you up as a mother and father both. 
[09:12] I was so proud of you.
[09:19] You were such a good boy. 
[09:23] Handsome, intelligent, honest, loyal and hard working. And today..
[09:31] this is what you showed me. You behind bars?
[09:42] You have no idea, I cannot see my face to people. 
[09:47] Let people alone..
[09:50] I am questioning myself that where did I go wrong that I had to see this day.
[10:02] I don't believe it. My life has become hell. I cannot sleep.
[10:14] I don't know what will happen in the future? 
[10:17] How will you clear your name? How will I be able to show my face to people?
[10:28] Totally broken.
[10:35] You have no idea that her son is everything for a mother.
[10:46] I had so many expectations from you.
[10:50]  I thought my son would take care of me.
[10:57] He would support me but see.. See this.. This is what I've brought for you. Why?
[11:13] I don't believe it. This isn't my Hamza. That girl made you do it. 
[11:17] Didn't I tell you to leave her? 
[11:20] Had you left her, this wouldn't have happened. I wouldn't have to see this.
[11:32] That girl became so important to you that you didn't listen to your mother. 
[11:38] Why didn't you listen to your mother, Hamza?
[11:42] I should have listened to you.
[11:47] I'm suffering because of that.
[12:20] Sign these. The lawyer gave these. He'll try his best to get you out.
[13:04] The proofs are against you. 
[13:11] I have very little hopes that I can get you out,
[13:15] but since I'm your mother. I'll try my best. I will.
[13:27] Please forgive me.
[13:31]  I know I made a lot of mistakes in life.
[13:42] Please get me out of here. 
[13:46] I cannot stay here. I feel suffocated. 
[13:52] Please get me out.
[13:57] Yes. Sure.
[14:36] I'll take you by the collar. Tell me where is my daughter?
[14:40]  I wanted to take her along for this reason. 
[14:43] I knew you'd be busy pampering each other. 
[14:47] how you would have cared for my daughter?
[14:53] How did I leave a piece of my heart with you guys?
[14:56]  I should have taken her along. Why did I leave her here? Where is my daughter?
[15:18] What are you thinking?
[15:21] I was thinking about Falak.
[15:27] She accused us for such a big thing. 
[15:31] She didn't even realize it was Hamza's doing.
[15:39] I don't think Hamza did it alone.
[15:46]  I'm 100% sure that Falak was involved in all this.
[15:49] Because as indifferent and selfish she is, I think she put all this in Hamza's brain.
[15:57] It could be so. What can we say?
[16:02] When a person has power, why do they forget who they are?
[16:10] They claim to be God.
[16:14] When Hamza had power, he thought he could do anything he want. But he forgot
[16:20]  that you reap what you sow in this world. You have to suffer if you do wrong.
[16:27] You're right. This world is a reaping ground for what we sow. 
[16:33] The hole you dig for others, becomes your own grave.
[16:43] Did you talk to the lawyer? Did he say something?
[16:48] I did. He said the case is very strong. He could be sentenced for a minimum of six years.
[17:12] You? Why did you come here? I hate you. Leave!
[17:18] I hate you.
[17:21] Let alone hate, I feel nauseated looking at you.
[17:27] I thought whatever happened was Kabeer's doing, but it was you. 
[17:33] You kidnapped my daughter and kept her in pain for so many days.
[17:38] I did everything because of you. So that you could have her.
[17:42] You're lying. It was nothing like that.
[17:46] I wanted to bring my daughter to me but not like this. 
[17:50] Not by hurting anyone.
[17:56] Children are innocent like angels. How did you do this to my child?
[18:02]  If you had told me once, I'd have never let you do it.
[18:11] A mother can tolerate everything but she cannot see her children in pain.
[18:19] Now you'll tell me all this? 
[18:21] When you left your daughter crying, didn't you realize her pain then?
[18:27] I was wrong. I was wrong but I've realized. Even if its late.
[18:36] And you didn't do all this for me. You did this to satisfy your ego. 
[18:42] You wanted to hurt Kabeer and Nawal and you used my daughter as a pawn.
[18:49] You're an indifferent person!
[19:01] Are you saying this?
[19:03]  Why am I here today? Only because of you.
[19:11] You're behind all this destruction. Only you!
[19:19] God knows why I was trapped because of you.
[19:22]  Its because of you, I lost the most valuable thing in my life.
[19:32] I loved Nawal so much. 
[19:36] I lost her because of you.
[19:43] You're not worth having in my life.
[19:53] That's why today, I set you free.
[20:09] I'm divorcing you.
[20:18] I'm divorcing you.
[20:30] I'm divorcing you.
[20:55] You're a cheap man. Very cheap. 
[20:58] Thank God sister Nawal didn't come in your life or else you'd have destroyed her life like mine.
[21:02]  A cheap man like you, didn't deserve a good girl like her.
[21:11] You're a cheap man..
Falak, lets go from here.
[22:22] Considering the proofs and the witnesses, the court has decided 
[22:26] that both Hamza Hashim and Sher Khan are equally responsible for Ilham Kabeer's kidnap.
[22:32] That's why both the criminals are sentenced to 6 years in prison.
[22:38]  The court is adjourned.
[23:31] Surprise..
Hamza.. Oh my God..
[23:36] Hello. How's my baby?
Very good. Hamza?
[23:41] Dear, all of a sudden? Nazish see who's here. Come fast.
[23:46] Yes mom..
[23:48] Hamza? What a pleasant surprise?
[23:52] Hello. How are you?
[23:53] I'm fine. Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
[23:57] Had I told you, would you have been so happy?
[24:13] My son.. How will he spent so many years in prison? 
[24:18] How will he suffer so much pain? I brought him up with so much love.
[24:24] Oh God, have mercy. Save my child. How will I live without him?
[24:40] She's very helpless, she'll not live here forever. Its only for a few days.
[24:47] Not at all. I don't like her living here. Tell her to leave.
[24:54] She has nowhere to go. Tell me where will she go?
[24:57] She can go anywhere she wants to. I don't give a damn. Just tell her to leave. Please.
[25:07] This is very wrong. She's my friend.
[25:10] Please..
[25:16] Falak.. when did you come?
[25:21] Just a little while ago when you and Yasin were arguing.
[25:25] Falak I'm very embarrassed. I tried to explain him but he doesn't listen.
[25:33] Its alright.
[25:35] You did enough for me
[25:40] I'm so sorry Falak. If I could, I'd never have asked you to leave.
[25:46] I can understand. You're my only friend. You've done a lot for me already.
[25:55] But where will you go Falak?
[26:02] I'll go to any girl's hostel. I just need a place to stay.
[26:09] Alright. I'll give you some money. You'll need it.
[27:00] Come in the balcony
[27:03] Oh, you here?
[27:05] Yes I wanted to see you so I came here.
[27:08] So why are you standing there? Come inside.
[27:10] No. I'll see you from here only.
Alright. You stay there. I'll come.
[27:25] If you have emotional memories with this house, you can keep it. 
[27:29] As it is, once my movie is released I'll not live in this coup. I'll get another house. Bigger house.
[27:51] A mother's love in unmatched. If you try to find it, you never will.
[28:00] A human being loses everything because of his haste. 
[28:05] He earns a loss rather than benefits. 
[28:09] He loses what he won.
[28:13] That's why my dear, you should be patient.
[28:34] Forgive me, mom. I made a big mistake. Forgive me..
[28:50] If only I hadn't given this house to Nawal in exchange for the plot.
[28:55]  I would have had this house as a shelter.
[29:21] Come on..
[29:33] Listen girls, you'll have to share your room with her. 
[29:37] And listen to me, pay me the rent before the 5th of every month or else I'll fine you.
[29:50] Is this how the fan works?
[29:52] Yes this is how it works? Do you want me to get an A.C for you?
[32:03] Falak..
[32:11] You?
[32:21] You shouldn't have come here.
[32:23] I know I shouldn't have come here
[32:27]  but everything is finished sister Nawal..
[32:31] Hamza has divorced me.
[32:40] Didn't you tell me that relationships based on bad intentions and lies aren't strong?
[32:47] They break soon.
[32:53] Our relationship was like that. Based on lies. 
[32:59] Without a foundation. A opportunist like me stays empty handed.
[33:07] I kept running behind money and wealth and left all my relations.
[33:12]  I forgot that this was a deal in loss.
[33:23] I hurt you very much. I treated you very badly. Please forgive me.
[33:39] Falak I have nothing in my heart against you. I have no complaints with you.
[33:50] These are the custody papers for Ilham. I'm giving you her custody.
[34:11] I don't want her to be like me. 
[34:14] I treated everyone badly but I don't want to do my daughter anything wrong.
[34:23] I want her to be like you. 
[34:28] Someone who loves everyone and takes care of them.
[34:35] You loved an ungrateful, step sister like me. 
[34:44] You forgave everything I did wrong. I want her to be like you.
[34:56] I wronged you. 
[34:59] If you can, please forgive me. 
[35:03] Ask Kabeer to forgive me as well.
[35:10] Take care of my daughter.
[35:15]  Please make her like you.
