[00:12] Hamza, you must be very angry right? The matter is as such
[00:16] do you know, I have kept my engagement ring very safely as its quite close to my heart
[00:21] I don't want to loose it, that's why I have kept it safely
[00:24] after all, what problem do you have here? 
You have got everything here, then what else do you want?
[00:30] you are my problem
[00:34] I don't like you at all in front of me
[00:37] sister, what have you done?
[00:39] I had brought dinner for you, if you didn't wanted to have it then you could have told me. Why did you threw it?
[00:44] Aliya, what is this?
[00:46] I haven't done this. She threw it, she did it herself. She is lying
[00:51] God willing, time will show you that I was right
[00:55] this girl is that termite which makes a green tree shallow from within
[01:25] the person on whom you were putting so big allegations
[01:29] just go & look at her
[01:31] even right now, she is more worried about you than herself
[01:36] do you know, what was she saying to the doctor?
[01:39] that go & do sister Aliya's check up first, because she needs it more
[01:48] Aliya, she cares about you a lot
[01:51] and you
[01:54] what you did to her?
[01:59] I feel so disappointed
[02:53] Kabir... please relax
[02:58] I know what is your condition right now
[03:03] how can I relax, brother?
[03:06] I am feeling so helpless right now
[03:12] I can't find any solution to come out of this problem
[03:15] on one side, its my mother like sister-in-law and on the other side is my wife
[03:22] I don't want to hurt sister Aliya, nor I want to break Falak's heart
[03:28] where shall I go? What shall I do?
[03:35] sister-in-law doesn't believes on Falak's love
[03:40] she thinks that Falak is just pretending her love for her, however its not like that
[03:47] Falak also respects sister-in-law in the same manner like I do
[03:52] I know
[03:55] I know exactly what you mean
[03:59] but see, don't worry...
[04:02] God willing, everything will be fine and I am with you
[05:10] Falak
[05:13] Falak, what is all this? Where are you going?
[05:17] I am going to my house, this is fine
[05:21] Falak, its not appropriate to go at this hour
[05:23] try to understand. Look at the time
[05:26] the time is bad, Kabir
[05:31] I cannot stay here, I want to go home
[05:33] Falak, Kabir is absolutely correct. Its not appropriate to go at this hour
[05:37] you want to go home, right?
You can go tomorrow, he will drop you
[05:41] No brother Toqeer, I have understood that I can never make my place in this house
[05:46] and sister Aliya is also not happy. I am the reason behind all this restlessness
[05:50] So I cannot live here
[05:52] Okay Falak, lets go inside the room and.. 
[05:55] Kabir, No! I don't want to talk about anything
[06:01] I just want to go home. Are you going to drop me off or I shall go with the driver?
[06:06] Falak, what's wrong with you?
[06:08] What will we say after going there? That why we came here?
[06:11] we'll tell them the truth
[06:13] She should also know that how her daughter is being treated in this house
[06:17] I will become mad, Kabir. I just want to go home
[06:19] Falak, will you discuss our personal house matters in front of others?
[06:23] they are not others but my mother
[06:25] are you coming or not?
[06:27] Okay, wait a minute
[06:29] brother, let me go & drop her off
[06:56] is this what you wanted, right?
[06:58] that Falak shall leave this house
[07:02] then congrats! She has left the house
[07:05] what!
[07:07] why are you being so amazed?
[07:11] Aliya, I had this fear
[07:13] I used to explain you for this day, I used to tell you not to do it
[07:16] not to do whatever you are doing, the consequences will not be good
[07:22] but no
[07:24] you didn't listen to me at all
[07:27] now see
[07:29] the thing I was fearing, had happened
[07:35] Falak has left this house
[07:38] I never wanted this to happen
[07:41] then what was the motive of whatever you did? Tell me
[07:44] I have done nothing! Why don't you believe me?
[07:51] Aliya, remember one thing
[07:55] Kabir is dear to me like Hafsa
[07:59] and if any problem occurs in his married life because of you
[08:05] then I will never forgive you in my life
[09:41] think once again, Falak
[09:44] there is still time
[09:46] lets go back home
[09:48] somehow we'll find out the way of this issue
[09:52] there is only one solution of this problem
[09:54] separate house
[09:57] Falak, this is not possible for me. Its quite difficult
[10:00] Please try to understand this compulsion
[10:05] its not possible?
[10:07] then its fine, Kabir
[10:11] leave me... divorce me
[10:32] Falak
[10:44] how easily you have said to divorce you
[10:51] will you be able to live without me?
[10:54] I cannot live
[10:56] but I cannot tolerate all this anymore, Kabir
[11:01] sister Aliya's taunts etc..
[11:04] she has made me miserable
[11:08] it seems as if I have become so tired of it
[11:12] sometimes I feel that I will die while keeping your family happy
[11:19] you cannot do anything, because your hands are tied
[11:24] sister Aliya cannot tolerate me in that house. Then you tell me what shall I do?
[11:29] it doesn't make any difference to you but I feel suffocated in that house now
[11:36] what shall I do? Where shall I go?
[11:39] instead of dragging your life
[11:43] its better for you to leave me
[11:47] and stay happy in your life
[11:50] Falak
[11:52] I cannot imagine to leave you or to stay without you
[11:57] a person gives thousands of sacrifices for those whom we love, Kabir
[12:03] and I am not asking you to give a very big sacrifice
[12:07] before marriage you had claimed that you'll keep me very happy
[12:11] I am not asking you to get me moon & stars
[12:15] its not that difficult, Kabir
[12:18] now you have to decide
[12:21] do you love me or... 
[12:27] leave it
[12:29] let it be
[12:36] go home, its quite late night
[13:24] mom, sister Nawal...
sister Nawal... mom
[13:32] Falak, you are here & that too so late night. Is everything alright?
[13:36] Falak, what happened? Talk to me
[13:38] Falak! 
mom... .
[13:40] what happened my dear? Why are you crying?
[13:42] at least tell me what had happened? Is everything alright?
[13:46] nothing is fine mom, everything is finished
[13:50] what has been finished, Falak?
At least tell us what had happened.
[13:53] sister Aliya has ousted me from the house
[13:56] had Aliya told the entire reality to Kabir?
[13:59] No, I had covered that matter
[14:02] then what had happened? At least tell us, why she has ousted you from the house?
[14:06] the same that sister Aliya wanted
[14:07] She couldn't tolerate my existence in that house since day one. She wanted a chance, and she got it
[14:13] No, so where were Kabir & brother Toqeer? They didn't said anything?
[14:17] how can anyone say anything? Everyone is helpless in front of her. Nobody says anything
[14:22] mom, call Kabir right away & ask him what is this way
[14:25] do they think that Falak is an orphan, that they have ousted her from the house in the middle of the night?
[14:27] what is this way?
[14:29] there is no need to call anyone, mom
[14:32] leave it
[14:34] why there is no need to call?
[14:36] if I will not call them, then they will never realize their mistake
[14:40] the daughter & daughter-in-law of the house is the family's respect. How can they oust her in the middle of the night?
[14:45] mom, there is no need to call them
[14:47] As it is, she bad mouths about me to everyone. She did my character assassination
[14:52] there is no need to talk to her
[14:54] if you'll call her then she'll start bad mouthing about me to you
[14:58] but my dear, if I will not say anything then they'll feel that you have nobody to support you
[15:03] and they'll keep doing anything, and nobody will question them
[15:06] does a thief accepts after stealing anything? 
How will they accept then?
[15:10] Okay enough...
[15:11] there is no need to talk to them
[15:13] Okay, nobody will talk. Just don't worry, we'll take out some way
[15:18] come with me, come & do some rest
[15:42] have you dropped her?
[15:45] yes
[16:14] I am thinking to keep a small get together in our house in the joy of your engagement. What do you say?
[16:20] why small? keep a big one
[16:21] No, Nazish cannot come. We'll keep a big one once she'll come here. For now, lets invite a few people
[16:26] Okay, what objection can I have?
[16:28] Umm... is Sunday fine?
[16:31] I hope you don't have to go anywhere
[16:33] No... I have a flight to Islamabad on Friday. And I will be back on Saturday
[16:38] Sunday done! Lock it
[16:40] let me call others & invite...
[16:49] Kabir
[16:51] yes sister?
[16:53] I have made your favorite cheese omelet. Come & have breakfast first
[16:57] you guys shall do the breakfast, I am not hungry
[17:14] did you like the omelet?
[17:24] where are you going?
[17:29] at least have breakfast
[17:48] thank you!
[17:51] is Falak awake?
[17:53] No, I didn't wake her up. Let her sleep as she is upset
[17:59] I don't understand Falak
[18:01] how can we solve this issue without talking to Kabir & Aliya?
[18:06] its important to talk to them
[18:10] I can never imagine that these people will be like this
[18:15] now tell me, if well-educated people will do such cheap acts then eventually the society will be affected
[18:23] there is no room for patience, nothing else
[18:26] if we start giving space to each other, then the matter will never come to this extent
[18:37] sister Aliya wants to govern that house, the way she used to do it earlier
[18:41] She doesn't even gives a little space to Falak
[18:44] if she would have kept a big heart then maybe the matter wouldn't have reached to this extent
[18:50] anyways... nothing has been ruined as of yet. We'll go & talk to them
[18:56] they should know that Falak is not an orphan
[19:00] Ok remember one thing, when we'll go to talk to them
[19:03] then we'll say that Falak is not your real daughter. Or we'll mention that...
[19:08] sister Aliya came here to inquire
[19:11] if sister Aliya has not discussed about it, then we should also not discuss it
[19:15] We had made a very big mistake
[19:18] I hid the reality by coming into Falak's words
[19:21] I have such a big burden on my heart
[19:24] one day or the other the truth will be exposed to everyone
[19:27] until when it will stay hidden?
[19:31] don't know what storm will come then? 
I don't know how we'll face all that
[19:36] we have to face it
[19:48] its our compulsion to hide this matter right now
[20:26] Sir, Aliya maam has asked for the file. Please give it to me if you have finalized it
[20:29] yes, take it
[20:32] thank you, sir
[20:38] there is only one solution of this problem
[20:41] a separate house
[20:46] leave me... divorce me
[20:51] sister Aliya cannot tolerate me in that house. Then you tell me what shall I do?
[20:57] it doesn't make any difference to you but I feel suffocated in that house now
[21:01] a person gives thousands of sacrifices for those whom we love, Kabir
[21:06] and this sacrifice is nothing
[21:08] before marriage you had claimed that you'll this, you'll that and will keep me very happy
[21:17] now you have to decide
do you love me or... 
[21:26] Kabir
[21:28] yes sister
[21:29] have you filled this quotation?
[21:34] yes, I did. Is there any problem?
[21:39] look at this
[21:43] oh my God!
[21:45] Sorry, I don't know how come I have made this mistake
[21:50] where is your focus, Kabir?
[21:53] this mistake could have been such a big loss for us, if I wouldn't have checked it
[21:58] sister, I think I am not in my senses
[22:01] I don't know how I have made such a big mistake. Let me do it again
[22:07] Kabir, are you okay?
[22:11] yes, I am fine. Actually I couldn't sleep properly last night that's why I am a bit disturbed
[22:18] let me rectify it, Ok?
[22:21] No... I think you should go home & rest. 
You need rest. Please quickly go home
[22:29] Yes, you are right. I have some work in the office, then I will leave
[22:34] Kabir, I have never seen so disturbed. You really need to do rest
[22:39] the work will be done, please..
[22:45] I'm sorry again, and thanks!
[22:57] We have never expected this from a well educated family
[23:00] why? What we did, tell us? What we have done?
[23:03] Aliya...
[23:04] why should I stay quiet?
[23:06] We had gone to your in-laws house to talk to them
[23:12] what!
[23:20] I was thinking to call you because its been so long that we haven't talked.
 How is Nawal?
[23:26] Nawal is also fine, you know we hardly get any free time from the house chores
[23:31] I will pay you a visit in a few days with Nawal
[23:34] Okay, I have called you to give an invitation
[23:37] in the joy of engagement, this Sunday I have kept a get together in my house
[23:41] you guys have to come for sure
[23:43] God willing, we'll come for sure
[23:45] Tell Nawal to call me, I feel like talking to her
[23:50] Sure, I will convey your message. She'll call you
[23:54] Okay, take care. Bye!
[23:56] bye!
[24:01] whose call it was, mom?
[24:03] it was Ms. Sofia's call
[24:06] Next Sunday she has kept a dinner in the joy of engagement ceremony. So she was giving an invitation
[24:14] mom, by the way aunt Sofia isn't being so sweet?
[24:17] the same way Asjad's mother was pretending
[24:20] mom, I am feeling so scared
[24:23] what if tomorrow something happens again
[24:26] no, no... there is a lot of difference in both the families, Falak
[24:31] and Ms. Sofia is such an honorable & wise woman
[24:35] but still, I would recommend you to be careful
[24:39] Okay, go tell Nawal to call her. She is missing her
[24:46] Okay
[25:02] sister Nawal, mom got a call from aunt Sofia
[25:05] she is saying that she has kept a dinner on Sunday. She was giving an invitation
[25:09] yes, Hamza was telling me that she has kept a dinner in the joy of engagement ceremony
[25:14] really? By the way, your mother-in-law pretends to be very sweet
[25:19] she talks quite sugar quoted words
[25:21] sometimes it feels that talking to her for long time will make a person go diabetic
[25:25] Falak, she is like this. She treats everyone like this
[25:30] Such people are quite dangerous. Who are different from the face & something else from within
[25:36] Her nature is very polite. You have met her, she is not like that Falak
[25:42] anyways, no matter how polite anyone is. Everything changes after marriage
[25:46] look at sister Aliya, how she has changed her colors like a chameleon
[25:50] can anybody say that she is the same Aliya who was before marriage
[25:54] anyways, I am saying this for your betterment. Don't let her become so free
[25:59] if today you'll make her so free, then tomorrow they'll beat you
[26:02] its not necessary that every person is same
[26:08] it doesn't take much time for a person to change
[26:14] I don't want you to tolerate whatever I have suffered from
[26:20] I want your betterment
[26:23] So be careful & stay vigilant
[26:48] you guys have done a lot of injustice
[26:51] you have ousted her from the house
[26:57] you people are well-educated
[27:00] if there was an issue then you guys could have solved it by talking upon it
[27:08] sorry to say, but honorable people don't do such things
[27:13] but we haven't ousted her from the house, she had left the house herself
[27:16] in fact, Kabir has dropped her to your house. if you want you can ask him
[27:20] Its fine that she had gone herself, but why the matter got to this extent?
[27:25] the issue was between sister Aliya & Falak, so it should be solved in the house
[27:30] the matter will come out, everyone will talk about it & make a drama out of it
[27:35] a lot of issues happens in a house, but one doesn't leave the house like this
[27:40] Falak should have thought about it, she is making the spectacle out of it
[27:43] who had asked her to leave from here? She had left as per her own will
[27:48] the way Falak has been treated in this house, whatever you were doing with her
[27:52] after that, what other option is left with Falak besides coming back to home? tell me
[27:58] I have handover my daughter to you people so that you guys will care about her & will value her
[28:03] instead of treating her badly
[28:10] Ms. Sultana, its not like that. Nobody has done any sort of oppression on her
[28:15] there were a few misunderstandings due to which the matters got exaggerated. Nothing else
[28:20] nobody leaves the house on the basis of misunderstandings
[28:26] and maybe its a small matter for you but...
[28:29] whatever Falak has told us, they are quite humiliating
[28:33] We have never expected this from a well educated family
[28:36] why? What we did, tell us? What we have done?
[28:40] Aliya...
[28:41] why should I stay quiet? Can't you see how they are scolding me?
[28:48] Instead of feeling sorry for doing something wrong, you are exulting in it!
[28:51] did she inquire her daughter even once before coming here?
[28:57] She is such a big liar, hypocrite & an impostor
[29:02] She shook the basis of my family
[29:05] Falak is the one who has been exaggerating whatever is happening here
[29:10] she is the one who has created misunderstandings
[29:13] Aliya, please be quiet
[29:15] why should I stay quiet?
[29:16] she has made both of you against me, also she has told the lies to them
[29:20] these people doesn't even fear God at all!
[29:23] doesn't she know her daughter's nature?
[29:25] and if she says that she doesn't know, then she is lying
[29:33] whatever she has told you & Kabir, and to them. Its all a lie
[29:38] Aliya, stop it!
[29:40] Fine! You don't want to believe me right? Don't do it
[29:43] all of you will regret, the day Falak's reality will be exposed
[29:47] Aliya... Aliya!
[29:54] oh!
[29:55] hey Hamza you! how are you?
[29:57] I am absolutely fine, you tell me
[29:58] I am also fine
how come you are here?
[30:00] Umm... I came to meet Nawal. Is she home?
[30:04] didn't you call her? 
She is not at home, she has gone somewhere with mom
[30:10] No, I had called her but she didn't receive
[30:15] sister is quite careless
[30:17] you were calling her, no matter how busy she was. She should have attended the call
[30:20] at least, she could have inform you that she is not at home
[30:22] do you know sister Nawal is like this since childhood
[30:25] maybe, you don't value the things that you get very easily
[30:31] then whether its love or relationship. 
She is also like that
[30:37] and she doesn't value the people who are associated to her at all
[30:39] she knows they are here
[30:42] anyways, why are you standing here? Come inside. 
I was making coffee, let me make it for you too. I make a very good one.
[30:47] No, no thank you so much! Actually I remember some work
[30:51] but do inform Nawal whenever she comes back that I had visited
[31:16] See, I think the more we'll talk on this matter the more our personal issues will be increased
[31:21] therefore please explain Falak, tell her that such petty matters do happen in every house. Its not a very big deal
[31:29] one should show some patience
[31:31] Kabir
[31:33] you are her husband, right? 
You didn't supported her as well
[31:36] no matter what others did with her
[31:40] even you had left her to be judged
[31:50] what shall I say?
[31:52] I had never thought that I have to face all this after marriage
[32:02] and you are right, I am her husband
[32:05] that's why, I also apologize to you & to you too
[32:12] I remember, I wasn't agreed for this proposal. But I was convinced upon your insistence
[32:19] and honestly speaking, today I am very much disappointed upon my decision
[32:26] See, whatever you are saying is right
[32:29] We have made mistakes & I am so ashamed. 
 And I will explain Aliya
[32:35] but please, please explain Falak & tell her to come back home
[32:41] whatever issues & complains she have. We'll sit & solve them personally
[32:46] today, after seeing everything from our own eyes. How can we send her back over here?
[32:51] Aliya did a lot of injustices with Falak
[32:54] Tell Aliya to come over there & apologize to Falak
[33:01] and you guys shall guarantee me that now Falak won't be treated like that in this house
[33:07] only after that, we'll think about sending back Falak to this house
[33:11] Ok fine! I apologize to you on behalf of Aliya. And I will explain her
[33:20] and I guarantee you that next time we will not give you a chance to complain
[33:24] Tell Falak to please come back home
[33:44] hey, you guys are back?'
[33:46] yes dear, we are back
[33:48] where have you been?'
[33:50] we had gone for some important work
[33:53] and sister Nawal, why weren't you receiving Hamza's call?
[33:57] he came here, he seem quite upset
[34:01] I was busy that's why I didn't receive
[34:04] where were you busy? what was the work? I should also know
[34:11] we have gone to your in-laws house to talk to them
[34:16] what!
[34:20] I had forbidden you, then what was the need to go there?
[34:23] don't talk childish, Falak. We had to go to talk to them
[34:28] We had to ask them about the injustices which they are doing with you
[34:36] dear look, the issues will only be resolved by sitting & talking
[34:40] when I had forbidden you guys, then what was the need to go there?
[34:44] Falak look, everyone is guilty
[34:48] We had a word with Toqeer, he is saying.. He has assured us that he will talk to Aliya
[34:53] nothing as such will ever happen next time
[34:55] also Kabir has promised us that he will take very good care of you
[34:59] absolutely! the way they have explained her earlier
[35:01] nobody breathes over there without sister Aliya's permission
[35:04] I have told Kabir, that if he wants to continue with this relation then he shall get me a separate house
[35:10] otherwise he shall divorce me!
[35:13] have you gone mad?
[35:15] you have said such a big thing so easily? Is this a joke?
[35:20] Falak, right now control your anger
[35:23] I have tolerated & suffered whatever injustices had happened with me over there
[35:28] I cannot tolerate anymore. 
Its my right. I am not asking for anything illegal, mom
[35:33] if Kabir will not get me a separate house, I have said this thing clearly to Kabir
[35:36] that I will never go back there
[35:38] and if my husband cannot give me my right, then I don't need such a husband
[35:42] Falak, right now you are angry. Just relax for a few days, then we'll talk on this topic
[35:46] what now? Even after a week or a month...
[35:49] I won't change my decision, & I have already said to Kabir
[35:53] separate house or end this marriage
[36:50] finally you got the time to call?
[36:52] I'm sorry Hamza
[36:53] actually I was sitting somewhere with mom & we were talking on some issue that's why I couldn't attend the call
[36:59] its alright, there is no need to give so much of explanation
[37:02] by the way its true, you don't value those things which you get very easily
[37:07] you are getting upset like kids
[37:09] as I said, I was stuck in a problem. Don't you believe me?
[37:14] anyways, what's the matter? 
Falak was telling me that you came home as well
[37:18] yes.. I was in a mood to do the lunch. So I thought of doing it together
[37:22] that's why I came to your house directly from the office
[37:24] I'm sorry, I didn't knew. If I would have known then I wouldn't have gone with mom
[37:29] Okay, lets do one thing. Lets do the dinner together
[37:33] dinner?
[37:34] I have no problem but you decide, what if you get some other important work
[37:39] stop it! Taunting doesn't suits you
[37:43] Okay, see you at the dinner
[37:45] Okay, bye!
bye
[38:15] how are you?
[38:17] how can I be?
[38:19] I couldn't sleep the entire night, I was just thinking about you
[38:23] then why are you punishing yourself & me? Lets go home Falak, I am coming to pick you
[38:29] No Kabir, you will not come to pick me. I will not go back home like this
[38:34] Falak, please leave your contumacy. Isn't it possible for us to sit & solve this issue?
[38:38] its not my contumacy but my right!
[38:41] I also want to have my own house which I can decorate. Where I can live peacefully
[38:46] then Falak, who has stopped you? That is also your house
[38:49] you can decorate it as per your desire, who has stopped you?
[38:52] No Kabir, that is not my house
[38:56] its sister Aliya's house
[38:58] Falak, you know that I cannot shift into a separate house by leaving my brother & sister-in-law
[39:03] Kabir, I have decided
[39:05] I won't come back to the house like this
[39:07] you have only two options. 
Just think once before making any decision
[39:13] that if the decision won't come in my favor then I will kill myself
[39:27] you have to agree with me for sure...
