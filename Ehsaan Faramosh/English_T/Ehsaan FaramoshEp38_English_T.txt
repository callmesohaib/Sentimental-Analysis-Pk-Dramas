[01:06] What is it Aaliya? Why is brother so angry?
[01:12] Its nothing Kabeer. You go, I'll talk to you in a while.
[01:16] No. We'll discuss everything right now.
[01:26] Aaliya and I went to bring Falak back today?
[01:29] What?
[01:32] Why didn't you tell me before you went?
[01:40] And Aaliya, even you didn't mention it.
[01:46] We wanted to surprise you but..
[01:51] But?
[01:59] But what? Why are you both quiet?
[02:05] See Kabeer. I'll not beat about the bush.
[02:10] Aaliya and I went to bring Falak back.
[02:13] But your in laws insulted us a lot just because of you.
[02:21] What are you saying, brother?
Your wife has lost her mind.
[02:25] Had you not allowed her to model, she wouldn't have become so bold and brazen.
[02:37] Every time, she misused your soft nature.
[02:42] Toqueer..
[02:43] Whats wrong? Please stop.
[02:45] How can I stop? He should know what his in laws think about us.
[02:50] God knows what Falak told them. They feel we mistreat Falak in this house.
[02:58] And Kabeer? Your in laws have a demand now.
[03:03] Until you get a separate house, they'll not send Falak back.
[03:07] They're mad. They've lost their minds.
[03:11] Why didn't you people tell them that nobody mistreats her in this house?
[03:15] We tried to make them understand but they were not ready to listen.
[03:20] You should see Kabeer. Do as they say. Don't think about us.
[03:27] What do you mean by this, brother?
[03:30] Toqueer, they were angry. They're worried about their daughter.
[03:36] They said what they thought was best for their daughter. Its not a big deal.
[03:41] Kabeer will talk to them.
[03:43] Once they listen to Kabeer, all their misunderstandings will be cleared.
[03:47] What nonsense! What misunderstandings?
[03:51] Everybody knows that Falak fed them everything. The confidence with which they talked,
[03:57] did you feel there was a misunderstanding? Could there be a misunderstanding?
[04:03] I'm telling you clearly, Kabeer. As much as we've been insulted today.
[04:08] Falak is not coming back to this house, again.
[04:16] Its best if you can live in a separate house with Falak.
[04:30] What are you saying, brother? This can never be.
[04:33] I will not leave you and Aaliya ever. I'll stay here.
[04:38] And I will not let Falak destroy the peace of my house.
[04:43] Enough is enough. She creates a spectacle every single day.
[04:49] Had you controlled your wife since day one, things wouldn't reach this point.
[04:57] Its better that you live separately rather than she create a spectacle everyday.
[05:59] She creates a spectacle every single day.
[06:02] Had you controlled your wife since day one, things wouldn't reach this points.
[06:07] Its best if you live separately with Falak.
[06:54] I married off my daughter in your family thinking that you're educated people and would take care of my daughter.
[07:02] I never thought you'd mistreat my daughter like this.
[07:12] One day both of you brothers will live separately.
[07:15] This is what happens. So why not now?
[07:21] At least you'll be able to meet your brother happily.
[07:44] Toqueer what is wrong with you?
[07:47] What do you mean whats wrong?
[07:49] Aaliya I don't like it when someone points a finger at you.
[07:54] Don't you understand what was happening there?
[07:57] Who was Falak's family pointing out?
[08:01] Who mistreats her in this house?
[08:05] I understand.
[08:07] But right now, rather than being angry, think with a cool mind.
[08:14] It doesn't make a difference what Falak and her family wants.
[08:18] What makes a difference is what Kabeer wants?
[08:24] Enough Aaliya.
[08:27] I've decided. I want my house's peace back at any cost.
[08:36] And its only possible if Kabeer lives separately with Falak.
[08:41] What?
[08:42] Aaliya its best if you make yourself understand.
[08:47] And as it is, what did Falak's mother's say?
[08:53] After all how long will Kabeer and I live together?
[08:57] We'll have to live separately someday.
[09:00] Alright then, we'll live separately right away. Better sooner than later.
[09:43] What did you say to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer?
[09:47] Nothing. Nothing as such happened.
[09:50] Falak, don't lie.
[09:53] Didn't you tell them that you'll not come back until I get a separate house?
[09:58] I asked for whats my right. Whats wrong in asking for whats my right?
[10:01] Its wrong to insult them.
[10:04] They're like my parents. How could you think I'd live separately?
[10:10] Oh, so we sent them empty handed and they got insulted.
[10:15] I knew how Aaliya would exaggerate everything when she went home.
[10:19] But I didn't realize she'd feed you so much.
Falak!
[10:23] Lower your volume Kabeer, its my house.
[10:25] Is this your house? What did you tell your family here?
[10:31] That you're mistreated in that house.
[10:35] I didn't say anything. Mom talked to them on her own.
[10:39] Alright then. Come back with me right now and apologize to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer.
[10:46] I'm sorry Kabeer but I'm not going anywhere.
[10:49] And to apologize to them? Out of the question!
[10:53] Think about it Falak!
[10:55] I've already thought everything through. I'm talking after making my decision.
[10:59] You told me to chose between my husband and career. So you think now.
[11:07] Me, our child or brother Toqueer and sister Aaliya? Who will you choose?
[11:13] What? Have you lost your mind Falak?
[11:18] That's my family, like you're my family. There's no comparison between relationships and career.
[11:26] Relationships are above career.
Enough Kabeer, don't speak with Aaliya's words.
[11:31] What? What do you mean?
[11:35] I know very well. Sister Aaliya had problems with me working. You never had a problem.
[11:40] She keeps on feeding you and taunting you.
[11:44] She cannot see me happy. I'm scared Kabeer that she'll harm my child and you'll not say a thing.
[11:50] Falak!
[11:51] Move away from my daughter.
[12:01] How dare you hit her?
[12:05] Did you people see with your own eyes? Will you trust me now?
[12:12] Falak was right. You beat Falak up. Is this how you treat her?
[12:17] You didn't hear what Falak said.
[12:19] You did wrong. Look at her condition. It doesn't suit you to do this.
[12:26] I hadn't realize.
[12:28] I thought I had given my daughter to educated people but you're an educated illiterate.
[12:36] Is this how you've been brought up? Don't you know you don't hit a woman?
[12:42] I'll not send my daughter with you. Go away. Falak will not come with you.
[13:12] Raheel's business is spread all over. Nazish won't be able to handle it. You'll have to be here to help.
[13:23] You know very well, I cannot live here permanently.
[13:29] I have my own business. I need to look over it as well.
[13:34] Raheel's relatives are eyeing his business and money like vultures.
[13:39] Two have threatened to go to court. Raheel's lawyers said,
[13:43] we should try and have an out of court settlement or else the matter will go to court
[13:49] Yes, I talked.
[13:53] There's nothing to worry.
[13:55] I will be worried my dear. Its my daughter's right.
[14:00] If someone takes away my daughter's right, it won't be good.
[14:03] They want a small share and its no problem.
[14:08] They know very well they have no legal right on this property.
[14:14] And if they go to court, we'll win the case.
[14:20] Oh well, how's Nazish doing now? Is she okay?
[14:25] She's better. She's resting.
[14:28] Alright tell me when she wakes up. I need her signatures on a few papers.
[14:33] Okay.
[15:06] Brother, I wanted to talk to you
[15:11] Tell me.
[15:14] I want to apologize for whatever Falak's family said to you.
[15:19] And please forget about living separately.
[15:24] I cannot live without you and Aaliya. We're a family.
[15:29] Where will I go from here? What will I do alone?
[15:34] See Kabeer, I'm saying everything for you. Please try and understand.
[15:42] Falak isn't happy here
[15:45] and rather than creating scenes in the house everyday, wouldn't it be better we live separately?
[15:53] Sultana is right. How long will we live together?
[15:59] We will live off separately one day, so why not today?
[16:04] Its no big deal and she isn't making a useless demand.
[16:09] Don't make it a matter for you ego.
I'll not accept what you're saying.
[16:16] I'll not leave you and Aaliya, no matter how much you tell me or force me.
[16:25] Alright then, if you don't want to go, we'll go somewhere else.
[16:32] What? What are you saying?
[16:39] Someone has to go for the peace of this house. If not you, then us.
[16:58] Brother, you people don't go anywhere. I'll go.
[17:41] Thank God you received my call.
[17:44] I've been calling you since so many days, you weren't answering. Is everything alright?
[17:48] Yes. I had back to back meetings here.
[17:51] I have everything running according to me in Pakistan. Here I have to work according to them.
[17:56] Hamza you've been gone for so long.
[17:59] Don't you have a plan to come to Pakistan?
[18:01] Its difficult for now. But I'll try to come next month.
[18:06] Nawal, I'm very tired. Can I rest and call you back?
[18:14] Okay. Take care. Say hello to Nazish and aunty from me.
[18:19] I will.
[18:20] You take care.
Okay. Bye.
[18:25] Was it Hamza's call?
[18:29] When is he coming back?
[18:32] Not yet. He'll take some time.
[18:38] What fates we have!
[18:41] Only worries.
[18:49] Don't worry. Everything will be alright if God wills
[18:53] If God wills.
[19:00] I really liked Nawal. She is so sober and sensible.
[19:06] A girl like Nawal will suit with him.
[19:09] I don't like Nawal. I like Falak.
[19:14] I requested them even after they said no. I told them to discuss and inform me.
[19:21] My brother doesn't lack girls.
[19:24] We'll find someone else.
[19:25] I like Falak and I want to marry her. Its not a joke.
[19:29] How will I just marry someone without liking her?
[19:36] What are you doing? I brought food for you? Why did you throw the food?
[19:42] I didn't expect this from an educated woman like you. She brought food for you with so much love.
[19:52] This girl is a termite that knocks down a free from its roots.
[20:26] Kabeer is worried.
[20:30] I know.
[20:35] Aaliya do one thing, give your flat in Clifton to her
[20:41] so that he can bring Falak back.
[20:44] He shouldn't destroy his life because of us.
[20:48] You know basically Falak doesn't have a problem with this house.
[20:56] She doesn't want to come back because she knows
[21:00] she'll not get the freedom here that she wants.
[21:08] Basically Falak wants to live her life on her own terms and she cannot do that while she's here.
[21:17] But..
[21:19] Kabeer will not be happy if he lives alone.
[21:22] I know but it'll take some time and he'll settle down.
[22:01] Kabeer?
Yes?
[22:05] I had to give this to you.
What is this?
[22:09] This is my apartment's file. Touqeer asked me to give it to you.
[22:13] What is wrong with you people?
[22:18] At least you make him understand. Why is he doing this to me?
[22:22] He's doing this for your best. You have to worry for your unborn child.
[22:30] Actually you don't know what rubbish she has in her brain.
[22:36] And you know what? I've realized that,
[22:42] marrying Falak was the biggest mistake of my life.
[22:46] Don't say this Kabeer. Whats wrong with you?
[22:50] Whatever Falak said to you. Forget it and start your life afresh.
[22:57] Because you don't have to think about yourself and Falak only but your unborn child as well.
[23:04] One wrong decision will destroy 3 lives. Understand what I'm saying.
[23:49] Falak
[23:53] Whats wrong? Why do you look so down?
[23:57] Its nothing.
[23:59] Its important for you to be happy these days. Please take care of yourself.
[24:05] How can a woman, whose husband is upset with her, be happy?
[24:13] Do you know, before I got married and after I got married, Kabeer would call me so many times in a day.
[24:21] When I used to come see you guys,
[24:24] he would always be with me on the phone. He'd ask me when I would be home. He'd say he was missing me.
[24:30] And now see..
[24:34] He has turned his face from me. As if I don't have any worth in his life.
[24:41] Mom and I always want you to be happy.
[24:45] But we're helpless in this matter.
[24:50] That's why people say they're scared for their daughter's fate.
[24:55] You know, had it been in my hand.
[24:57] I would have taken away all your pains and worries.
[25:02] You wouldn't have to worry about anything.
[25:07] Trust me. I know. Aaliya must have told Kabeer to not contact me.
[25:16] She must be turning him against me.
[25:19] She must speak against me.
[25:21] One day, two days, how many days? God is just. People suffer what they do for others.
[25:34] God gives freedom to all these people. Nothing will happen to her.
[25:39] Don't spoil your mood. The weather is very nice. Lets have lunch somewhere.
[25:46] I am not in the mood.
Get up and come.
[25:50] Please..
Come. Go and get ready. Come on.
[26:42] Whatever Falak told you, forget everything and start a new life with her.
[26:49] You don't have to think about Falak or yourself now. But your child as well.
[27:09] Falak..
[27:17] I want to talk to you. Alone.
[27:25] I don't want to talk to you.
[27:29] Falak. Talk. I'll wait.
[27:39] Hurry up with whatever you have to say. I don't have much time.
[27:45] I'm ready to get a separate house.
[27:52] Really?
Hmm.
[27:57] Yes but I think mom won't agree, she won't send me with you.
[28:02] If you come home and apologize, maybe she'll think about it.
[28:06] Falak I don't want to repeat the past.
[28:11] And to be honest, I'm worried about my child.
[28:16] I'm doing this for the baby that's why I'm ready to forget and start afresh.
[28:22] What do you mean? You don't worry about me? You're doing everything for your child?
[28:31] I could never think Kabeer that you'd change so much.
[28:37] Those tall claims of love and promises, all of them were fake.
[28:42] Let me know if you want to come back. I'll come pick you.
[29:19] I was hurt with Kabeer's attitude yesterday.
[29:23] To be honest, looking at him this way, I didn't want to send you with him.
[29:31] What are you saying mom?
[29:33] What should I say? This is how he treats you? He was about to hit you!
[29:43] If he's doing this in front of us, what would he do behind us?
[29:47] I cannot risk sending you with him.
[29:50] Mom, Kabeer isn't like that. Aaliya turned him against me.
[29:55] Kabeer would never talk loudly with me.
[29:59] As it is, he is getting a separate house. We'll be rid of Aaliya.
[30:04] It'll never happen again. He's embarrassed.
Alright dear.
[30:10] I will not force you for anything.
[30:13] Its your decision whether you want to go or not.
[30:18] Falak, think about it once more. Its your life.
[30:24] I cannot live here all my life. I have to go one day.
[30:29] If Kabeer has realized, why should I embarrass him again and again.
[30:34] And as it is, he's doing so much for me so can I not forget this thing for him?
[30:40] alright then.
[30:42] As you wish.
[30:44] I've called Kabeer. He'll be here to pick me soon.
[30:48] Alright.
[30:50] Falak, if God forbid, if he says something wrong in the future that you cannot tolerate. Come back without worrying about anything at all. Understood?
[31:04] Alright. Don't worry.
[31:13] Hello? Yes Kabeer. I'm ready.
[31:16] I'll be there in a minute. Come outside.
[31:21] Will you not come inside?
[31:25] No Falak. We'll be late. We have to get home. Just come outside.
[31:29] Alright Kabeer. I'm coming.
[31:32] You know we're directly going to our new house from here.
[31:48] Kabeer, is this the apartment where we'll live?
[31:52] Yes. Why? What happened?
[31:55] Isn't it a little small?
Is it small?
[32:00] Its not that big either.
[32:05] I think you need to get your brain treated alongside your eyes.
[32:11] Are you taunting me?
[32:13] No. But if you want to compare this apartment with that house, yes, its small
[32:21] but its enough for the two of us.
[32:26] We need to get a lot of work done here.
What work?
[32:35] The paint and interior. I want to live here so I'll do it as I like.
[32:41] Whats wrong Falak? Everything is fine.
[32:46] You think its fine. I don't like it.
[32:50] ok
[32:52] You can change what you don't like. We can do that once we're here.
[32:56] Tell me when we're shifting.
[32:59] Just go and pack and we'll shift.
Alright.
[33:41] She couldn't even send someone for help or come herself.
[33:45]  She must be jealous.
[33:53] If you need some help, tell me.
[33:57] No its done now. Had you wanted to help, you could have come earlier.
[34:05] I just got back from work. Kabeer told me that you're here.
[34:10] Of course. He insisted with so much love. How could I say no?
[34:17] Its good. Dinner is ready. Lets eat together.
[34:22] No. I'll now eat in my own house.
[34:29] Will you not congratulate me?
[34:33] Congratulations. Try and take care of yourself and Kabeer.
[34:38] Don't worry. I'll take care of Kabeer so much that he'll not even think about you.
[34:46] I pray that you're always happy.
[34:50] I'll be happy but looking at you, it doesn't seem that you're happy.
[35:01] Thank you very much for the prayers. 
[35:05] Just pray that we live peacefully and happily in our house.
[35:14] God will make everything better.
[36:05] Hello. How are you?
I'm absolutely fine.
[36:09] You know Kabeer and I have shifted to a new house. 
[36:12] Yes. I was just setting up. Once everything is done. Do come. Yes everything is alright.
[36:25] Where is he?
[36:34] Hello.
Kabeer where were you? Its so late.
[36:40] Why what happened?
What would happen? I'm dying of hunger.
[36:45] Didn't you eat anything?
[36:48] I ordered lunch but then I thought we'd have dinner outside. But you got so late.
[36:55] So you could have cooked something.
[36:58] What do you mean cook? I don't know all this.
[37:03] You said you'd get a maid. Didn't she come?
[37:07] I've asked for one. She'll come around in two three days.
[37:11] Maid will come. What about the chef? When will he come? He'll be cooking.
[37:18] See Falak..
[37:19] Its just you and me here. You have to cook for two people. 
[37:24] And until the maid comes, you'll have to do things around the house.
[37:29] What is wrong with you Kabeer?
[37:33] I cannot work in the kitchen. I get skin allergy.
[37:37] You've never had this skin allergy earlier.
[37:42] I didn't get it earlier, but now I do.
[37:44] Try and cook. If you get skin allergy, we'll get a treatment.
[37:53] Alright. Why are you angry? I'm so hungry. I'll faint. Lets go and have dinner.
[38:01] I'm tired. Let me get freshened up.
[38:04] You're absolutely fresh. Lets go. Come on, right now.
[38:15] Do you need more flat breads?
No. Its enough.
[38:19] You didn't eat well in the morning.
I don't feel like it.
[38:25] Mom, has uncle really left?
[38:36] Yes dear. He has a new home so he has gone to his new home.
[38:41] Did he go because of you and dad?
[38:47] Who told you this?
[38:50] Falak aunty was talking to someone yesterday. I heard everything.
[38:56] She said you and dad bothered her so much that's why they left and got a new house.
[39:05] Actually, they didn't like this house anymore. 
[39:10] They found a new beautiful house and they went there.
