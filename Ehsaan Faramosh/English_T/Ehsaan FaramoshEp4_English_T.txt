[00:12] Falak tell me, who has injected this poison in your mind?
[00:16] This is not poison, this is reality mom.
[00:19] You are not digesting that a servant's daughter received such a good proposal and your daughter is sitting at house.
[00:24] If this proposal would come for your daughter then you must be very happy, you are getting jealous mom.
[00:28] You are getting jealous.
[00:29] Falak
[00:36] Nawal, I am really embarrassed.
[00:38] If I hadn't gone abroad at that time then my career would have been suffered.
[00:41] I couldn't get anything.
[00:43] You have dealt with loss.
[00:46] One doesn't need anything except love.
[00:50] You preferred wealth over love.
[00:56] You don't have to worry at all. Falak will live very happily here. She won't miss anything here.
[01:02] You won't regret on your decision.
[01:05] God willing.
[01:19] Thank you mom that you listened to me.
[01:21] So you are happy now.
[01:22] Yes I am.
[01:24] May God do better for her.
[01:25] Ameen
[01:27] Mom
[01:29] Mom
[01:31] Mom I am really sorry, I am very bad.
[01:35] I am really embarrassed.
[01:36] I have said so much out of anger, I won't do that again. Please forgive me.
[01:42] Get up and sit with me.
[01:50] I have always considered you as my daughter my child.
[01:54] That's why I thought that
[01:57] Whatever I will decide will be acceptable to you as well.
[02:04] I am really embarrassed.
[02:05] I shouldn't have done that.
[02:07] But I promise, I will act according to your wishes and I will get marry as per your wishes.
[02:23] Greetings
[02:26] I have a surprise today, guess that.
[02:30] I have to guess the surprise.
[02:32] Well, OK I got this.
[02:35] You have got something in office.
[02:36] Oho, think other than office.
[02:40] Greetings
[02:42] You have come very timely.
[02:44] There is a game going on here, it's a surprise but it's not business related.
[02:48] What's that surprise? No one's birthday today as well. And what about these sweets?
[02:51] Hey tell us, we are not that genius.
[02:55] OK I am giving you hint, tell me if it is about the biggest happiness of someone's life.
[03:03] It's about someone's life biggest happiness?
[03:07] We give up. Now tell us.
[03:08] Tell us sister.
[03:10] You have scored zero.
[03:12] Mrs. Sultana and Nawal had come just a while back.
[03:18] They have accepted the proposal.
[03:23] Really?
[03:24] Really?
[03:25] Hey, congratulations my brother.
[03:29] Eat sweets.
[03:41] I must say that you are the best sister-in-law in the world.
[03:44] I agree, you are the best sister-in-law in the world.
[03:47] She is the best wife too.
[03:48] Come
[03:54] Don't doubt on motherhood.
[03:59] If you find any such thing then you won't be able to find that.
[04:05] A hasty person loses everything due to haste and suffers losses instead of gains.
[04:16] He loses instead of winning.
[04:20] That's why my love
[04:22] Try to learn patience.
[04:27] We went to Kabir's house today.
[04:31] We have accepted that proposal and your engagement is next week.
[04:36] Mom
[04:40] As I told you
[04:42] You won't get any injustice in this house.
[04:46] I pray to God that my daughter will always live happily.
[04:52] I won't be able to repay this loan of yours throughout my life.
[04:56] This is not a loan, it's our duty.
[05:00] Well we have cried so much, I am tired, make a list.
[05:04] We can't do any preparation is such a short time. Cloths can't be stitched that quickly so buy ready made suits.
[05:09] Decide about menu and dishes, just tell me, I will arrange the booking.
[05:15] Thank you mom. I am sorry.
[05:18] I pray that may God keeps you happy.
[05:20] Who is calling?
[05:22] Aliya
[05:25] Greetings, what's up Aliya?
[05:28] Aunt, I forgot to tell you about our family tradition that engagement dress of bride is given by grooms family.
[05:35] So, tell Falak to get ready tomorrow and buy the dress of her choice.
[05:39] Hey, there is no need for these formalities, I don't understand these traditions by the way.
[05:45] It's our wish aunt, just tell Falak to get ready tomorrow, I will pick her.
[05:50] OK, as you wish.
[05:52] Bye
[05:53] Bye
[05:56] It was Aliya's call.
[05:58] Be ready tomorrow, she will buy dress for you.
[06:01] Nawal, you get ready as well and if time allows then go with your sister.
[06:06] OK
[06:20] I am sorry.
[06:21] Are you happy now?
[06:38] Well
[06:40] I will be back shortly, you stay here, I am coming.
[07:15] You are so beautiful that whatever will you wear will suit you.
[07:22] You are here?
[07:24] Why?
[07:25] Can't I come here?
[07:28] Where is sister Aliya?
[07:30] She will come as well.
[07:32] Till then let's select together.
[07:35] You don't know about trends.
[07:39] I only know that you are about to become mine for ever.
[07:45] And I am glad.
[07:47] You know what, I am very lucky.
[07:49] You should be.
[07:51] Because I am coming in your life.
[07:53] I don't believe that how did aunt Sultana got convinced suddenly?
[07:59] We have to make efforts to get something.
[08:03] And we get success because of our efforts.
[08:05] Thanks for the efforts.
[08:07] Hmm
[08:09] And those thing are very precious which we get after so many efforts. Don't forget that.
[08:13] I can not.
[08:19] Everything attached with me is very precious.
[08:23] And you have been attached with me.
[08:25] You know, this dress is good.
[08:32] Check this
[10:25] Wow, this ring is very beautiful sister.
[10:29] Thank you, Toqeer chose this for our engagement.
[10:34] It's been eight years.
[10:36] It's same till date.
[10:39] Brother Toqeer's choice is very good.
[10:41] Diamond ring on engagement.
[10:54] Falak, move your hand forward and wear the ring.
[11:54] Nice
[11:56] How do you like the ring?
[11:58] I am sure, you liked it.
[12:02] Actually, your outfit, jewelry and all shopping was made by sister Aliya with her choice.
[12:09] Didn't you choose the ring?
[12:13] I thought that you will chose the ring yourself.
[12:17] Actually
[12:18] I don't have experience to buy all such things.
[12:24] You didn't tell me, how is the ring?
[12:28] I don't like it.
[12:33] Hey, why are you so serious, listen my complete sentence. I don't just like it but I like it very much.
[12:42] Oh God
[12:44] You scared me.
[12:46] I didn't believe that why didn't you like sister Aliya's choice?
[12:51] She has a very good choice.
[12:54] Her choice is wonderful and I have complete trust on her choice.
[13:01] She never buy any substandard thing.
[13:04] She hardly likes anything.
[13:10] Yes, I have observed this today.
[13:13] That how wonderful her choice is.
[13:15] Really.
[13:19] Did you choose this ring for me?
[13:32] Nawal
[13:33] Yes
[13:35] What are you doing? Come downstairs quickly and bring gifts. They want to go.
[13:40] I have brought the bags. Didn't you invite uncle and aunt?
[13:43] They called me in the morning.
[13:45] They had to go to Islamabad due to an emergency, they were apologizing.
[13:48] He said, it's daughter's matter so they will definitely attend the wedding function.
[13:51] Go downstairs, I am bringing.
Just bring everything.
[13:55] These bags are left.
[14:00] Mom
[14:01] Yes, thanks
[14:02] This is for you from our side.
[14:04] There was no need for this, you said that there will be no formalities.
[14:08] These are not formalities.
[14:11] Just like you have fulfilled your wish, so it's our wish.
[14:15] Please don't refuse.
[14:16] Nawal, give them.
Yes mom.
[14:19] Nasreen, take these.
[14:23] Take that one as well. OK
[14:27] We should leave now.
[14:29] Tell us, when will you come to our home?
[14:33] Actually, we wanted to fix marriage date this month, it would be better.
[14:41] This month? It's so soon.
[14:45] We need some time for preparations. We are bride's family.
[14:49] Listen, don't worry about dower, we won't take dower at all.
[14:55] Even then, what our daughter deserves, we will give her.
[14:59] And we are from bride's family, there are so many things and preparations to be made.
[15:04] Listen Mrs. Sultana, please don't insist.
[15:06] We won't take dower at all, no matter whatever you do.
[15:10] By the grace of God we have everything.
[15:14] And even then if anything is required then Kabir will manage that.
[15:18] Of course, Kabir will manage everything. Why do bride's family arrange these things?
[15:26] OK, as you wish.
[15:28] Let my brother come, then I will come after consulting with him to your home to fix the date.
[15:34] That would be great. We will be waiting for you.
[15:38] And you will have to bring Falak with you as well.
[15:43] God willing.
[15:49] I have recommended your case, now you will have to come. No excuse OK.
[16:42] Tell miss Nawal to bring the file of that project I gave her yesterday.
[16:55] Greetings sir, here is that file.
[16:59] Why didn't miss Nawal bring this file herself.
[17:01] Sir, she completed this file put this on my table yesterday.
[17:04] I asked that why didn't she come herself?
[17:06] She is on leave sir.
[17:08] What?
[17:09] On leave?
[17:10] Why?
[17:15] OK, you may go.
[17:17] Right sir.
[17:31] Come to my room.
[17:44] Come in.
[17:46] Yes sir.
[17:47] Why didn't miss Nawal come to office?
[17:49] She is on leave today, there is an engagement function at her house today.
[17:53] What?
[17:55] Miss Nawal's engagement?
[17:56] Sir, I didn't ask and nor she told me.
[18:05] OK, you may go.
[18:07] Thank you sir.
[18:30] Can I ask about the nature of work?
[18:35] Sorry, I don't discuss my personal matters in office.
[18:40] And not at all with a stranger.
[19:05] Toqeer chose this for our engagement.
[19:08] It's been eight years.
[19:10] It's same till date.
[19:13] Brother Toqeer's choice is very good, diamond ring on engagement.
[19:17] By the way, Kabir's choice is very good as well.
[19:29] Here is tea.
[19:43] Falak, you are so lucky.
[19:46] You are getting married in a very loving family.
[19:49] Aliya, brother Toqeer and most importantly Kabir.
[19:54] And what about this ring, how is it?
[19:58] It's so beautiful and it looks beautiful in your hand.
[20:03] You like everything.
[20:05] Why? Didn't you like it?
[20:08] What's in it?
[20:09] It's just an ordinary ring.
[20:11] It's so beautiful Falak.
[20:16] A big business man like Kabir.
[20:20] A billionaire, has given a gold ring on his engagement and that too to a beautiful girl like me.
[20:26] I can't deserve such cheap things.
[20:29] Didn't you surprised?
[20:31] Not at all.
[20:32] Because, to me precious things have no value, Falak.
[20:37] I give importance to sincerity and love of people more than such things.
[20:42] I am surprised that in which world you are living?
[20:45] These are basic protocols to live your life.
[20:50] So we have to follow these.
[20:52] Falak, things don't bring happiness to your life.
[20:57] Relations bring that.
[20:59] Instead of chasing precious things, give importance to relations you will be very happy.
[21:05] And wear this ring.
[21:09] It looks beautiful in your hand.
[21:13] Don't think that it's a gold ring, it's cheap or precious. Rather wear this ring by thinking that who gave you this ring.
[21:21] How many times mom told us that dad has bought a simple ring from an ordinary store. She has kept that safely till date. Why?
[21:32] Because things are rated not because of the price but because of the person who gifted us.
[21:37] Hmm
[21:39] You maybe right.
[21:45] OK
[21:46] Take tea, I have made this with so much interest for you. Take it quickly, it will get cold.
[22:14] Greetings
[22:15] Greetings
[22:16] Bring some bread as well.
[22:18] How are you and how was your day?
[22:20] It was really good, I was playing bridge with my friends.
[22:25] OK
[22:26] And do you know, what were they asking continuously? When will Hamza get married?
[22:30] So, I have decided that I will find a nice girl and get you married.
[22:35] No way mom.
[22:37] I am not in a mood to have any extra responsibility at the moment.
[22:41] You will have to take this responsibility. You are involved in business so much that you are unaware of everything.
[22:46] Your wife will take care of you and my stress will be over.
[22:52] I am not a child that wife will come and take care of me.
[22:56] I can take care of myself.
[22:58] You can't avoid me.
[23:00] If you like any girl then tell me, I will talk to her family, there is no issue.
[23:06] I haven't yet thought about this.
[23:07] So, it would be better that stop thinking about it now.
[23:10] I want to grow my business and want to focus on business.
[23:14] Listen, wealth and business are very important.
[23:17] It determines a person's social standing.
[23:20] But there are some more important things than that.
[23:23] Like a family life.
[23:25] Marriage and children.
[23:27] You don't have any idea that how beautiful our life became when you and Nazish came to our life.
[23:33] When you make your family then you will know, what I am talking about.
[23:38] OK
[23:39] If you want then I will think about it.
[23:43] Really, but think about it seriously, because I will ask my friends to find a good girl for you.
[24:06] Hello
[24:08] Hi
[24:09] What were you doing?
[24:11] Nothing, I was just sitting.
[24:14] Can I ask something Kabir?
[24:16] Yes, ask.
[24:19] Have you ever done anything with your consent?
[24:22] I mean.
[24:24] Against the wish of sister Aliya.
[24:28] Yes, I have done that.
[24:30] Engagement with you.
[24:34] Whereas, more than you, sister Aliya liked...
[24:39] What happened? Why didn't you complete the sentence?
[24:42] Did sister Aliya wanted to get you married somewhere else?
[24:46] Let it be.
[24:48] I called you to talk about ourselves.
[24:52] I will tell something about me and listen something from you but you are discussing these things.
[24:57] Kabir, you are changing the topic.
[24:59] Tell me.
[25:00] To which girl she wanted to marry you.
[25:04] Falak
[25:04] This is not an important thing now.
[25:08] By the way tell me, what do you like.
[25:12] I like to travel, go for outing, spend time with friends.
[25:19] To eat spicy food.
[25:20] I really like all of this.
[25:22] And watching movies as well.
[25:24] Oh wow.
[25:25] Do you get time along with studies to do all of these activities?
[25:29] Obviously, you have to manage all these things to enjoy your life.
[25:35] OK, leave me, tell me what do you like?
[25:38] I....
[25:43] Is there a long list that you are thinking so much?
[25:47] No, list is not long.
[25:49] But I am just thinking that what do I like?
[25:54] I didn't think about it.
[25:56] By the way
[25:58] I feel, I don't like anything.
[26:02] I think about my business all the time.
[26:06] All the time?
[26:07] Yes, all the time.
[26:09] Because I move around all the time.
[26:11] I have my own restaurants so I stay at hotels as well.
[26:15] If I got any chance in office then I watch any film.
[26:20] Then you are so boring person.
[26:23] I also think like that.
[26:25] OK, no problem.
[26:26] I will change you.
[26:29] Really?
[26:31] OK
[26:32] I will be waiting.
[26:34] Yes
[26:57] Why didn't miss Nawal come to office today?
She is on leave today, there is an engagement function at her house today.
[27:07] If you like any girl then tell me, I will talk to her family, there is no issue.
[27:38] Is miss Nawal in office today?
[27:41] OK
[27:42] Send her to my room.
[28:04] Yes
[28:06] Please sit.
[28:15] You were on leave yesterday.
[28:17] Can I ask why?
[28:21] I had a personal work.
[28:22] I had already informed earlier.
[28:24] Only one day earlier.
[28:28] It was an emergency.
[28:30] It was an important work, if that hadn't then I wouldn't take leave.
[28:35] Can I ask about the nature of work?
[28:40] Sorry, I don't discuss my personal matters in office.
[28:45] And not at all to a stranger.
[28:50] You love this stranger sometime back.
[28:54] You promised to live together.
[28:56] I already told you.
Yes I know.
[29:00] Yes, I know that I have to stay within my limits.
[29:02] And don't have to discuss old things.
[29:07] OK, you may leave.
[29:43] Check your email, I have sent you photo shoot of new product.
[29:49] It's approved. Vouchers will be made for that.
[29:53] OK, bring me the sample.
[30:20] Hello
[30:21] Hi
[30:22] What are you doing?
[30:23] Nothing, I am getting bored. What are you doing?
[30:27] I am getting bored as well.
[30:29] OK so let's go to a beautiful place together.
[30:32] Your mood will get fresh and mine as well.
[30:35] This idea is not bad but
[30:38] I have to attend an important meeting after two hours.
[30:42] OK, leave it and attend your meeting.
[30:45] No, we have still two hours. Get ready, I am coming.
[30:50] No, leave it, we will go some other day.
[30:53] If we got late outside then you won't be able to attend meeting.
[30:56] I am telling you.
[30:58] I am coming in fifteen minutes. There is sufficient time left in meeting.
[31:01] OK
[31:24] Kabir, read these documents before meeting, it's important.
[31:27] Sister, you have checked these so it's enough. I am going for an important work.
[31:30] It's important that you study these, so have a look at it.
[31:33] You have studied so it's enough.
[31:35] I have complete trust on your skills.
[31:38] Where are you going and why are you in a hurry?
[31:42] My friend is coming so I am going to pick him from airport.
[31:45] Which friend is coming, tell me about him.
[31:47] You don't know him, sister.
[31:49] We have a meeting at 3 PM and look at the time.
[31:52] I will be back. I mean.
[31:54] I will try to come at the earliest. And if will get late then take care of the meeting.
[31:58] You know that flights get delayed sometime.
[32:04] It means that you have intention to get late.
[32:14] Kabir you were busy, I mean you had a meeting.
[32:18] Yes I had to attend but it's OK, sister will take care of that.
[32:22] No, I mean even then
[32:24] If sister Aliya will find out that you have come here to meet me by leaving meeting then she will get angry.
[32:29] Falak, don't take tension and don't think that much.
[32:32] Sister Aliya won't feel bad about it at all.
[32:35] And sister Aliya is very broad minded by the way.
[32:37] In fact she will feel good about it.
[32:51] By the way, this color is looking good on you.
[32:56] I told you that sister Aliya's choice is very good and you will like it too.
[33:01] Yes, of course
[33:02] In fact, everyone liked everything.
[33:05] Especially, everyone has praised that gold that.
[33:10] Sister Aliya's choice is really very good.
[33:14] But my friends had objection on engagement ring.
[33:17] They said that he is such a big business man but he gave you gold ring, he should have given you diamond ring. But I shut them up.
[33:26] I said that there is no value of diamond and gold.
[33:29] The person has the value who puts that ring in your finger with love and care.
[33:39] Things don't have any value.
[33:49] Thank you Falak.
[34:04] Hey, where are we going?
[34:09] Just wait, you will know.
[34:18] Kabir what's all this? I don't like this.
[34:21] But I am liking this.
[34:24] It's really expensive, don't take my friends' words seriously.
[34:28] Falak, I am not doing this because of your friends' words.
[34:32] I am doing this with my consent and happily.
[34:35] OK fine, this is enough, I won't buy anymore. Let's go.
[34:41] Kabir
[34:45] Kabir please.
[34:47] Come in.
[34:53] Greetings
[35:02] Do you have rings?
[35:04] Yes we do have.
[35:05] Please show us.
OK
[35:07] Why are you embarrassing me?
[35:10] Falak, there is no need to get embarrassed.
[35:12] I am not a stranger. I am your fiance.
[35:16] It will be really expensive.
[35:18] But
[35:19] No ifs and buts, just do what I am saying. Look at this.
[35:24] How is it? Is it good?
[35:25] Kabir you are making things difficult for me.
[35:28] If sister Nawal and mom find out then they will scold me.
[35:31] Why will they scold you, don't I have any right on you? Can't I give you any gift?
[35:37] Look at this. How's this one?
[35:41] It's nice.
[35:43] Tell me if you like then let's finalize this.
[35:46] You won't listen to me. It's nice it's beautiful so buy this one.
[35:50] OK then it's final.
[35:53] Please pack this one.
[35:54] OK. Thank you.
[35:59] Do you need anything else? A bracelet or something else?
[36:01] No, Kabir.
[36:03] Don't embarrass me, it's enough.
[36:08] Excuse me.
[36:14] What's up sister?
[36:16] Kabir
[36:17] Where are you? Everyone is waiting for you in the meeting.
[36:20] Sister, I won't be able to attend the meeting. I'll be a bit late.
[36:24] Please manage it.
[36:27] Kabir, you know that how important this meeting is.
[36:30] Sister, I am so sorry, please manage.
[36:36] OK, OK, bye.
[36:42] I know you are so busy, please drop me at home.
[36:46] Don't worry, I have asked sister, she will manage the meeting.
[36:50] Thank you.
[36:55] Meeting is more important, we can go for outing later as well.
[36:58] I know what is important and I am doing that.
[37:03] We will go for lunch from here. I am starving. Then I will drop you at home. OK.
[37:31] Nawal, I want to talk to you.
[37:33] Sorry
[37:34] But I don't want to talk to you.
[37:39] You didn't attend office yesterday, I was very worried for you.
[37:43] There was engagement function of my sister at home yesterday, that's why I didn't come.
[37:48] By the way, there is nothing left between us so that we get worried for each other.
[38:00] Can't you forget Nawal.
[38:04] I admit that I made the mistake.
[38:06] I should have informed before leaving.
[38:09] I apologize.
[38:13] Do you know, Hamza?
[38:16] Man does not trample you for no reason, he first believes that you are at his feet.
[38:26] A person is most humiliated by the people he likes.
[38:33] What should I do that you forget everything and forgive me?
[38:39] How much a person can be punished for a single mistake?
[38:42] The punishment for some mistakes is lifelong regret.
