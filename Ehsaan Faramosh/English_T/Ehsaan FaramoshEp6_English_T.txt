[00:12] Actually we want to inform Kabir's family about you before fixing the date!
[00:19] What do you want to inform? That I'm actually the daughter of a servant.
[00:24] You know what will happen after that! They'll reject the proposal.
[00:27] Won't you ask about your sisters visit to Pakistan?
[00:31] She would be coming to meet me! Why should I ask?
[00:34] No! I called her for a special mission.
[00:38] What is the special mission?
[00:40] Your marriage!
[00:42] When aunt Fareeha talked about Falak...
[00:47] Did you notice the face of Sultana aunt?
[00:50] Your are right!
[00:53] I found it weird too!
[00:59] I feel like there's something weird.
[01:17] Falak! You here?
[01:20] Why are you so stunned? Can I not visit my future husband's office?
[01:24] You can surely visit!
[01:27] You done with the meeting? Should we go on a lunch?
[01:30] Falak! I cannot ! Actually I have lots of work load. It is not possible for me to go there.
[01:44] Hello!  Hello sister Aliya!
[01:48] Do you know that I'm in office? I'm here to ask him out for a lunch and he isn't listening to me.
[01:54] You should speak with him.
[01:56] Yes sister in law! I've told her that I have an important meeting. We'll plan later.
[02:04] She is forcing to go today!
[02:06] You should tell him. He'll listen to you!
[02:10] You should go! If Falak is requesting then you should go.
[02:15] But sister in law! The meetings are really important.
[02:18] Then what! Sister Aliya will look after the meetings! Right?
[02:24] Don't worry! I'll handle.
[02:30] Fine sister in law! Thank you! I'm sorry!
[02:36] Falak! What is this blackmailing?
[02:39] Should we go?
[02:41] Lets go!
[02:43] Sure! Lets go!
[02:56] What happened Kabir? Why is your mood off?
[03:02] Falak! I stopped you but you still came to office.
[03:08] Then what? I wanted to meet you.
[03:14] Falak! I had meetings.
[03:17] When the boss isn't attending the meetings. There can be problems.
[03:24] Fine! Meetings are more important than me.
[03:27] Nobody is more important to me than you but you should think that sister Aliya would've minded it.
[03:34] sister Aliya keeps her personal life and professional life differently!
[03:39] Sure Kabir! You can drop me to my house. I don't want to go to anyplace.
[03:42] You should attend your meeting! I thought..
[03:47] We'll have fun together and talk! But I was wrong! I shouldn't have came.
[03:54] You just don't care about a persons heart.
[03:57] Emotions don't matter to you! You should drop me to my home.
[04:03] Falak! Spending time together and outings can happen after official timings.
[04:10] This isn't the way that we can do this all the time or whenever you say.
[04:16] Kabir! If you stay bound like this when you have your own business, what's the point of life. A 9 to 5 job is better.
[04:22] At least you are available for your relations in such a life.
[04:25] Falak! Your own business is ran after you take all the responsibilities.
[04:29] This isn't any 9 to 5 job! I have to stay available for 24/7. This is a restaurant business.
[04:39] Tell me quickly! Where do you want to go and what do you want to eat?
[04:43] What should I tell! You should just drop me to home.
[04:49] For God sake Falak! Why don't you understand? I have to reach!
[04:53] OK fine Kabir! You should park here. I'll go to home by cab. I won't call to meet you or anything after today.
[05:02] I made a mistake! Relation is more important than business?
[05:07] This business can facilitate you! It can provide you money!
[05:11] but It'll never give you that happiness which you'll find with a life partner.
[05:18] Falak! What should I tell you?
[05:25] Fine! I'm sorry that I got rude at you! I'm really sorry!
[05:30] Kabir! Please drop me here! I'll go home by using a cab.
[05:36] Falak! I'm saying that I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you!
[05:42] So now you want me to apologize?
[06:19] Navaal!
[06:24] You didn't leave?
[06:25] I got a little late!
[06:28] It's late! I'll drop you.
[06:30] No! I'll go! I have my car.
[06:33] Navaal! How will you travel alone at this time?
[06:37] It's not safe! I'll drop you!
[06:39] Why? Why can't I go alone?
[06:42] It's 9! I've left the office at this time before. Don't need to get worried for me.
[06:57] Don't you trust me?
[07:01] It's not about trust! I don't need any help.
[07:07] It hurts when you expect form strangers who leave you when you need them.
[07:13] Can't you forgive me?
[07:14] I'll forgive by my tongue! But I cannot forgive you from my heart.
[07:23] A life is needed to tell this heart.
[08:05] Hey groom! Have you selected the card for your marriage?
[08:09] The card will be selected by sister in law.
[08:14] It's your marriage! You have to select! Understood? Now you are getting married.
[08:20] Your room decor and furniture! Your wardrobe will be selected by you! All of this will be selected by you. I'm not responsible. Right Tauqeer?
[08:29] You are right!
[08:31] Stop giving responsibilities to my wife! You should call Falak and ask her about everything.
[08:39] I want the same!
[08:41] Wait brother!
[08:43] You both cannot cut yourself out of this responsibility.
[08:47] Why?
[08:48] This is the reason!
[08:50] My wedding decor and venue is supposed to be decided by sister in law. My dress too!
[09:00] But then! I want relaxation from so many office work.
[09:07] After that! We haven't selected wedding cards. What will be the venue and food.
[09:14] The dresses for bride and groom. This is a lot of work. I don't know Tauqeer. How will I do this?
[09:20] Don't worry! You'll manage everything! I trust you!
[09:25] I know why you trust me! But I don't trust you! Whenever I go for shopping, you'll join me.
[09:33] If you both are good for shopping. You should do shopping for me.
[09:39] See!
[09:40] Seriously Tauqeer?
[09:43] He wants me to do everything for him and I have to do many things on my own too.
[09:51] Take him to a designer and help him choose the dresses for functions.
[10:01] Tell me! Which card should we select?
[10:05] Here! See this!
[10:08] Sister in law! You should choose it!
[10:11] He is right! You should choose it yourself.
[10:15] If you rely on us! Cards will be decided after marriage.
[10:21] This is good! You both team up.
[10:24] Ok show me
I like this! I think that there should be more options like this.
[11:00] Hello!
[11:02] I'm Hamza!
[11:08] I was just worried that have you reached home safely?
[11:13] I told you that you don't need to be worried for me.
[11:18] My life isn't that easy!
[11:21] You think that my life was easy?
[11:23] You chose that life! Nobody asked you or forced you.
[11:28] Your dream was more important to you!
[11:31] I'm ashamed!
[11:34] I chose dreams over relations.
[11:38] I shouldn't have done it!
[11:39] If I knew that you are not the part of my dreams then I would've never chose dreams.
[11:49] I thought that you'll be happy about me going overseas and becoming successful.
[11:54] I would be happy!
[11:58] I was just hurt because you didn't tell me.
[12:05] I got to know when you left!
[12:08] Navaal! I missed a flight for you! I waited for you but your number was powered off.
[12:15] I ask for forgiveness.
[12:25] You said it Navaal! lovers cannot stay mad at each other for too long.
[12:31] I was wrong! I feel bad.
[12:35] I was wrong too! I'm ashamed.
[12:43] Well! You got what you wanted.
[12:48] You shouldn't feel ashamed!
[12:52] That's why I feel ashamed! That I'm actually empty from my heart.
[13:01] I've lost the most important part of my life.
[13:05] I've settled myself after so many difficulties and hardships.
[13:11] I cannot get hurt again! Don't call me again!
[14:02] Hello!
[14:05] How are you?
[14:08] I'm mad at you! You didn't come to pick me up from the airport.
[14:11] I've waited for you the whole day and you didn't even meet me.
[14:15] I came to your room but you were sleeping!
[14:19] I slept for 2 minutes and you decided to dodge me.
[14:26] It's not like that!
[14:29] Whatever! Tell me about your kids.
[14:33] They had school so I couldn't bring them. I just came for 2 weeks.
[14:39] I wanted to meet you and mother!
[14:42] It's good that you came! I have a tour to Canada next month. Please sit!
[14:50] Hamza! You should think about something separate from business.
[14:56] I mean about your life.
[15:00] What is wrong with my life? Everything is fine.
[15:05] I'm talking about your marriage!
[15:08] Mother is worried!
[15:10] You should at least think about her.
[15:14] She is alone in the house.
[15:17] A mother is happy after she watches her son get married.
[15:22] I'll get married! It's not like that I won't get married.
[15:27] I just need sometime.
[15:30] Tell me that do you like somebody?
[15:39] I told you that I need sometime!
[15:42] I don't think that mother wants to wait! She has specially called me for this purpose.
[15:49] She just wants me to convince you and talk to you.
[15:54] Listen Hamza! If you like any girl! Do tell us. If you don't!
[16:00] You should listen to mother!
[16:06] Mother was telling that Aliya told her about a girl.
[16:11] She is nice and her family is nice too!
[16:14] Me and mother are serious for her! Now you should just decide quickly!
[16:20] Fine! You look tired! You should rest a bit. We'll talk tomorrow.
[16:25] OK!
[16:37] Yes?
[16:39] Yes? How's your mood?
[16:45] It doesn't effect you!
[16:48] Why? What are you saying?
[16:53] You didn't call! I was waiting.
[16:56] Why were you waiting? You should have called me.
[16:59] No! I made a promise today.
[17:03] That I won't start the love.
[17:05] People who start the love get ignored like me.
[17:10] Falak! Please forget it!
[17:14] Sure! I'll forget it! But you have to promise me that you will not act like that again.
[17:18] Sure! I promise! Such thing will not happen again.
[17:25] I'll forget the purpose of this video call.
[17:29] These are the cards for our wedding. Select the card. I don't understand. You should help me.
[17:37] I need you to suggest me the cards! This is card number 1
[17:45] Here is card number 2. This is the card number 3.
[17:53] This is the best.
[17:55] Really? This is nice.
[17:59] Kabir! Why are we selecting? Didn't sister Aliya help you with it?
[18:03] sister Aliya wants me to do it! And I want you to choose.
[18:09] Kabir! When will we do shopping for wedding?
[18:13] We talked! Now it's on sister Aliya! Whenever she decides to take me.
[18:19] I don't know if she'll even ask me!
[18:23] sister Navaal said that bride decides for the shopping of marriage.
[18:28] Then I thought that sister Aliya won't take me!
[18:33] She might call you tomorrow.
[18:36] If she does! Let her do it on her own. You should not talk to her about this.
[18:40] She might think bad about me!
[18:42] You do over thinking! Don't think like this! sister Aliya will think good for you.
[18:49] Sure! Then I'll wait.
[19:02] Sultana! You can adopt a child but you should be careful that the child can become dangerous for your own children.
[19:42] This is a gift from my side for Falak's marriage!
[19:46] Brother! No need for this. Thank you!
[19:50] You people should just be a part of the wedding. That's honorable for me.
[19:55] Obviously we will come! It's happy news for our family.
[20:03] Keep it as a gift!
[20:08] If Falak is your daughter! She is our daughter too.
[20:13] And don't get hurt by the words of Fareeha.
[20:16] I know brother! It's her habit.
[20:20] I didn't tell Fareeha about this cheque! You should not talk about it too.
[20:25] Brother! Why is she jealous of Falak so much?
[20:29] She has her own opinion. She just thinks that your actual children deserve the love. One should not invest on an adopted one.
[20:38] It's not like that! She is wrong.
[20:41] Sultana! You can adopt a child but you should be careful that the adopted child can become dangerous for your own children.
[20:54] Be careful!
[20:56] Falak shouldn't affect on Navaal's future.
[20:59] You should not worry! I won't let Navaal be affected by anything.
[21:05] And yes! You should not worry. Take more money from me if you want to!
[21:15] Thank you brother!
[21:37] Sister! Do it quickly! I have some more work to do.
[21:41] Hey! You are not going anywhere.
[21:44] I have to do a lot of shopping! Stay here with me.
[21:47] You should do it! What's my need?
[21:50] Where are you going?
[22:06] You do shopping! I'll be back!
[22:10] Where are you going?
[22:11] I'm not going anywhere! I'm here! You should do your shopping!
[22:22] This color doesn't suit you!
[22:27] This blue color will suit you a lot!
[22:32] You?!
[22:34] Don't be scared! I'm not stalking you!
[22:40] I brought sister to shopping!
[22:47] She is here?
[22:49] Yes! Since 2 days.
[22:51] Greetings!
Greetings!
[22:54] Sister! This is Navaal! My company's finance manager.
[22:58] How are you?
[22:59] I'm fine! How are you? How are your kids?
[23:03] You know about my kids?
[23:06] Yes! Actually me and Hamza were together in the university. That's how I deeply know about you guys.
[23:14] Sorry! Wait a second.
[23:18] Yes Falak! Sure! I'm coming.
[23:24] I'm so sorry! I have to leave.
[23:27] Sure!
[23:31] Who was she?
[23:33] She is my company's finance manager.
[23:36] I know but you both were in the same university! What is it?
[23:43] I feel shy!
[23:45] Hamza!
[23:52] Sister in law!
[23:54] Are you going somewhere?
[23:55] Yes! I had to do shopping for Falak! I decided to do it today.
[23:59] Oh! you should take Falak too.
[24:01] Obviously I'll take her when I need her! I'm just going to buy some casual dresses for her. That's why!
[24:08] Sure! You should buy everything according to yourself but do ask her about her choice too. So she doesn't feel bad.
[24:16] She is the bride! It's obvious that I'll buy everything according to her choice.
[24:20] You had to go to your designer today! Get ready for it.
[24:25] I almost forgot! Thank you!
[24:28] I'll take her too! Don't worry.
[24:32] Hamza! You are hiding something from us. Tell me what it is or I'll find out myself.
[24:41] It's all on you!
[24:44] I like Navaal!
[24:47] What?
[24:52] Seriously?
[24:55] Why didn't you tell us before?
[25:00] I didn't think that I had to tell.
[25:04] Me and mother are worried about your marriage and you already like a girl.
[25:10] Now you are saying that there's nothing to tell?
[25:13] Hamza! You behave so weirdly sometimes.
[25:17] Why didn't you tell? You didn't know that we were so much worried.
[25:27] Sister please! We are in a shopping mall. Not in our house.
[25:31] Yes! But I'll tell mother that you like your colleague.
[25:38] No! Please don't tell mother about this. I don't want my mother to know about it.
[25:44] Why Hamza? It's good to tell her.
[25:48] You don't even know that you have helped us with our worries.
[25:52] Me and mother will go to her house tomorrow and talk to her about marriage.
[25:56] What are you saying? You won't do anything like this. You won't tell mother! You will not go to Navaal's house.
[26:03] Why? Is she not interested in you?
[26:08] We'll talk later!
[26:11] You do your shopping! I'll be back after attending this call.
[26:19] Shaheen! Bring water for me.
[26:27] Wow! Are you guys back?
[26:32] Mother! We just bought 4 dresses.
[26:35] You guys came so late and just brought 4 dresses?
[26:39] She didn't like anything!
[26:42] It's not like that! My wedding is luxurious! My dresses should be branded.
[26:48] Sure! Buy everything according to her. No compromises.
[26:53] Here!
[26:55] What is this?
[26:57] Brother came and gave this cheque for Falak's wedding!
[27:02] Mother! What is the need for this? We'll manage!
[27:08] I told him the same.
[27:11] But he said that if Falak is your daughter! She is our daughter too.
[27:16] I couldn't argue with him.
[27:23] You are my mother!
[27:25] Whatever you are doing! It's enough. We are doing great. We don't need to take money.
[27:32] Kabir's family doesn't want dowry! So you should return this to him.
[27:37] Darling! This is your wedding gift.
[27:40] I cannot return this!
[27:43] Mother! Falak is right. We don't need this. We'll manage.
[27:47] Do you guys know? If you return a gift! It's just like slapping that person. You want my brother to get mad at me.
[27:55] No at all! I'll keep this cheque. We might need it later. You guy don't understand.
[28:04] Show me what you guys brought!
[28:08] Show what you chose!
[28:10] This is my choice.
[28:30] So Hamza! Tell me about Navaal!
[28:33] You like her?
[28:36] Since when? Does she know about your feelings?
[28:40] I think this isn't the right time to talk on this topic.
[28:42] What? Why are you dodging this topic?
[28:47] So you want me to tell everything to mother! And she handles everything according to herself.
[28:53] I think that I did wrong by telling you!
[28:56] Listen Hamza! You and Navaal are university fellows!
[29:01] You both know each other! If Navaal matches our status and belongs to a good family then why not?
[29:12] Actually! I created a mess long time back. I'm just being punished.
[29:17] Tell me! I'm listening!
[29:23] Listen Hamza! Tell me the reason. I can't do anything. Did she reject you?
[29:31] Just think this! She doesn't want to marry me.
[29:37] How could she do this?
[29:40] How can a girl reject a boy like you?
[29:46] Does she like somebody else?
[29:51] I never asked her!
[29:53] Now tell me Hamza! What do you want?
[29:56] Please talk to mother and close the topic of marriage! I get irritated.
[30:04] Listen Hamza!
[30:06] She'll keep trying until she finds the reason.
[30:11] It looks like you don't have anything to talk about except the topic of marriage.
[30:16] I don't want to get married. I want to focus on business.
[30:20] Please inform her! Please!
[30:33] Hello!
[30:35] Come to the balcony!
[30:36] Right now?
[30:38] Yes! Right now!
[30:51] You here!
[30:54] Yes! I wanted to see you! That's why I came here.
[30:58] Why are you standing outside? Come inside!
[31:00] No! I won't come inside!
[31:03] I'll watch you from here.
[31:05] What is this? Wait! I'm coming.
[31:25] Why don't you come inside?
[31:28] Let's go somewhere out! Where should we go?
[31:31] Wherever you say!
[31:33] Let's go to someplace you like!
[31:40] I just like you!
[31:43] Sure! Let's go to the place I like. Let's eat something.
[31:49] No! I didn't tell mother.
[31:51] We'll return in an hour.
[31:53] Look at my dressing!
[31:57] You look beautiful!
[32:00] You think I'm joking?
[32:02] Look at yourself from my eyes!
[32:08] You don't trust me?
[32:10] I trust you!
[32:15] Sit!
[32:17] Door!
[32:37] Navaal!
[32:38] Mother! You should have called me.
[32:42] Nothing! I wanted to talk to you.
[32:46] What is it?
[32:48] Sit!
[32:53] I know!
[32:57] You feel hurt when I talk about this again and again!
[33:05] You won't understand my worries! I'm a mother.
[33:10] Mother! Tell me.
[33:16] My friend called me!
[33:20] She told me about a proposal! the boy works in an IT firm.
[33:26] He is engineer too.
[33:28] Mother! I've told you that I don't want to get married.
[33:32] Sure! Don't marry.
[33:35] We'll see the boy! If you like him. We'll just do engagement.
[33:40] Marriage will happen according to you!
[33:43] Mother! Falak is getting married. So much is going on already.
[33:47] You should focus on that!
[33:49] Everything will happen.
[33:51] Just give me the permission for it. If they are good. If you like them! We'll just do engagement.
[34:02] If you get engaged before your sisters marriage.
[34:07] You don't even know! My mind can rest.
[34:15] You are forcing me!
[34:20] It seems like you want to get rid of me.
[34:23] You are so stupid! I won't ever be like that.
[34:28] Why are you forcing?
[34:32] Falak is getting married because it was written for her. I'll get married to when it's written for me.
[34:37] I want to marry a family where I bring you with me! I don't want to leave you alone.
[34:47] My darling!
[34:50] Daughter depart from house.
[34:55] Parent's don't!
[35:12] Tell me about the arrangement for wedding!
[35:15] It's happening! Everything is going smoothly!
[35:19] That's great! Where is Falak?
[35:21] I was going for shopping! I came here to pick her up. So she can buy everything according to herself.
[35:25] She is in her room! She'll come. 
Shaheen! Go and call Falak! Tell her that Aliya is here to pick her up.
[35:33] Our house is surrounded with happiness.
[35:36] That's great!
[35:37] Where is Navaal?
[35:39] Navaal is busy with her job! She can only enjoy when she comes back.
[35:42] Goes for shopping!
[35:44] Falak is here!
[35:45] Greetings! 
 Greetings!
[35:48] How are you?
[35:50] I'm fine! I don't have time. I'm going for shopping. I have to take you with me. Go and get ready quickly.

[36:53] Navaal! It's personal! But it's important!
[37:00] Speak! I'm listening!
[37:04] Hamza told me that you've rejected his proposal.
[37:11] I want to know the reason for it.
[37:14] Hamza didn't tell you the reason?
[37:17] No!
[37:19] You should ask it! After you know! You'll think that I did right.
[37:27] Do you like someone else?
[37:30] That's a very personal question!
[37:35] I don't share everything.
[37:39] Navaal! If you don't like anyone else. Then please think about Hamza and forgive him.
[37:48] He is a gentleman!
[37:50] I'm not saying that because he is my brother! No!
[37:56] He is actually kind hearted and he loves you a lot!
[38:02] You should at least give him a chance.
[38:06] It's better that you ask your brother about this!
[38:10] then you should talk to me after that. 
Excuse me!
