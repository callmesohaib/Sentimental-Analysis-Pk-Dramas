[01:09] They are very nice people. They have a beautiful house and everything is wonderful.
[01:16] If God wills, my daughter will have a wonderful fate.
[01:20] my daughter will stay very happy
[01:27] I just couldn't move my eyes. Isn't mom?
[01:31] Everything was wonderful. The house was so big.
[01:38] My house is nothing as compared to it.
[01:41] sister Nawal you're very lucky you're going to such a good house.
[01:45] I'd say you should groom yourself too. They'll come for the betrothal ceremony soon.
[01:50] Look at the way you live. Its very important. There's a huge difference between theirs and our status.
[01:57] That's why I'm saying you should groom yourself before you get married so that you don't have any problem later.
[02:05] She has been working for a long time and running this house.
[02:09] My daughter is very confident and sensible.
[02:14] You'll see, she'll adjust easily.
[02:18] You're absolutely right. I agree but still she'll have to think about herself.
[02:22] She'll go with me for shopping now.
[02:25] You will not shout and you'll have to get whatever I say, wear it and stay like that.
[02:32] Nawal, go shopping with her in a day or two. Shop for your engagement too.
[02:39] Alright fine. I'll go.
[02:45] Now both of your sisters, sit and talk. God has listened to my prayers.
[02:49] I'll go offer prayers of gratitude.
[03:16] Your house is very beautiful. everything seems to be branded. It looks as if you have imported everything.
[03:21] Yes, mostly everything is imported.
[03:40] This is a small gift for you.
[04:06] What are you looking at?
I'm looking at this necklace.
[04:12] You see and tell me how much its worth.
[04:16] Falak, don't judge a present by its worth but the love of the person gifting it.
[04:24] But still tell me what its worth.
[04:27] It must be worth millions. Hamza gifted it to you. He doesn't give away cheap presents.
[04:34] But why are you asking?
[04:38] Its nothing. I was just setting my jewelry and I set eyes upon it so I brought it here.
[04:48] I'll keep it back.
Hmm..
[05:05] Hello?
[05:06] Thank you Nawal for giving me the biggest happiness in my life.
[05:14] Why are you quiet? won't you say something?
[05:18] I said yes, isn't it enough?
[05:21] Nawal, did you make this decision yourself or did someone pressurize you?
[05:28] I made this decision myself. It was a difficult decision,
[05:33] but then I thought only human beings make mistakes and its only sensible to forgive.
[05:45] Trust me Nawal, I'll never break your trust again.
[05:51] I will not repeat the mistake again.
Mam, Nawal?
[05:56] Mam is calling you for dinner.
[05:58] Alright. You go ahead and I'll come.
[06:00] Listen mom is calling me for dinner. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
[06:30] Nasreen
[06:34] Keep them. You'll tell me whatever Aaliya does, whoever she talks to. Especially when she talks to Kabeer.
[06:44] Alright mam. I've Understood.
[06:48] Keep this.
[06:51] Thank you mam.
[06:54] Do as I told you. Keep an eye on her.
[06:59] Don't worry mam.
[07:03] Go and do your work now.
[07:46] maam you!
Nasreen, who gave you this money?
[07:51] Actually. I didn't steal, mam.
[07:55] Tell me the truth. Don't lie.
[07:59] I swear.
[08:01] I heard and saw everything. Come with me now.
[08:05] You've been working with us for years, we took care of you and you forgot your loyalty today.
[08:12] Whats happening?
[08:13] What nonsense is this?
[08:15] Touqeer look at this. Falak gave money to Nasreen to spy on me.
[08:23] What?
[08:25] Yes. I heard them talking.
[08:29] How could she! Nothing like this has ever happened in our house.
[08:33] I will not tolerate anyone trying to shake the foundations of my house.
[08:39] Nasreen, what is she saying?
[08:43] Is this true that Falak gave you money to spy on her?
Tell him.
[08:49] I'm asking you something, answer me.
[08:51] brother Touqeer, I gave her the money for her sick husband.
[08:57] I have no idea why you're looking at my good deeds with suspicion.
[09:03] What did I do? Why are you doing this?
[09:12] Falak, you will not lie once again.
[09:16] I've heard and seen everything myself. The mask has fallen off your face.
[09:21] Enough Aaliya. Don't you have to show face to God? Why are you hurling false accusations at me?
[09:27] If her husband was sick, why didn't she mention it to me?
[09:30] So what if she mentioned to me? I will not shout out the good deeds I do.
[09:39] You have made a habit of creating a spectacle, no matter what I do. You think I'm always wrong.
[09:50] Please Aaliya. Nasreen go away. Go.
[10:00] Aaliya is Aaliya but Touqeer, do you also think I'm capable of this?
[10:06] Falak, this isn't how it is.
[10:09] I'm sure, Aaliya has a misunderstanding.
[10:20] A misunderstanding happens once, not every time.
[10:23] She insults me every time. Such cheap tactics. Don't worry, we'll leave this house very soon
[10:33] Falak..
[10:39] Touqeer she's playing games with me.
[10:41] Enough. Aaliya enough is enough. Just let it go, okay.
[11:13] I was thinking why shouldn't we have the engagement next week?
[11:16] We need a week to make arrangements.
[11:19] Alright. If you find this date feasible, we have no objections.
[11:23] Fantastic. Congratulations. May God bless our children with a good fate.
Ameen
[11:30] Listen, be ready. We'll go shopping tomorrow.
[11:34] Aunty.. Please get whatever you want to buy for me.
[11:38] Nawal, I only have one son and I have always kept this in my heart. I want to shop for his wedding, I want to dance
[11:46] and now you'll accompany me on shopping everyday.
[11:49] Shopping everyday?
[11:51] Yes. Everyday and you'll not say No to me.
[11:57] You should come along.
No. You should take Nawal along. You have double responsibility.
[12:02] Nazish is not here. Had she been here, she would have taken you.
[12:05] Now see, I'll have to fulfill the responsibility of a mother and sister in law both.
[12:23] Wow Falak. You've been very intelligent. Aaliya, I'll not let you win so easily.
[12:33] I'll throw your sensibility on your face. You'll see.
[12:48] Falak, what happened?
[12:51] Ask me what didn't happen? I shouldn't have come back.
[12:56] But what happened, why are you crying?
[12:59] Again a drama. Aaliya created another drama to show me down and now she has Nasreen along.
[13:07] She insulted me in front of her.
[13:10] I gave Nasreen money for her sick husband and Aaliya said that I gave her money to spy on her.
[13:18] You tell me, why would I do that? I don't understand why is Aaliya after my life.
[13:23] Why is Aaliya behaving like this?
[13:27] She was never like this.
[13:29] What should I do Kabeer? Should I go somewhere or kill myself?
[13:33] I've tried everything to make her clean her heart but she doesn't come to that.
[13:40] Alright. Calm down. Don't worry. I'll talk to Aaliya and make her understand. She'll understand.
[13:49] Kabeer if she has a problem with me, we'll leave from here. At least she'll be at peace.
[13:55] What are you saying Falak? How can we leave home and go?
[13:59] I can never think about it.
[14:02] Even I don't want such a thing Kabeer but the situation at home,
[14:07] What is all this? Nobody is at peace. Even Touqeer is upset with me. I cannot tolerate all this Kabeer.
[14:15] Falak, look here. Relax and sit.
[14:22] We'll think about it. Please stop crying. You don't look good crying.
[14:31] I'm here with you. Don't worry.
I'm tired of this chaos everyday.
[14:39] I'm telling you I'm with you.
[14:46] Trust me. I heard everything with my own ears.
[14:50] You have a phobia with Falak. You're always thinking about her.
[14:56] Sometimes what you see or hear is wrong as well.
[15:01] How can I make you trust me? She isn't as innocent as she seems.
[15:07] I'm amazed at your thinking.
[15:10] You have started domestic politics like typical middle class women.
[15:16] Aaliya you're an educated, sensible woman.
[15:20] This doesn't suit you. This is upsetting.
[16:01] Did you see? You will get nothing having a tussle with me.
[16:06] If you put up resistance in my way, you'll suffer yourself.
[16:12] Lies don't have feet. It won't stay hidden for long. One day everybody will know.
[16:21] The truth is that you're just mistaken and its not a good thing.
[16:28] I don't want bad for anyone. Why would I want it for you as well?
[16:34] Do whatever you want to. One day the mask will fall off your innocent face.
[16:42] I will not let this happen.
[16:45] No way, you will not be able to govern me like you govern this house.
[16:55] I will not let this happen.
[17:12] Please have something.
No. I'm stuffed.
[17:18] Hello aunty. You here?
Hello dear. How are you?
[17:22] I'm fine.
How are you my dear? Sit down.
[17:26] Actually I was here to pick Nawal up. We're going for shopping.
Alright. I,
[17:33] sister Nawal..
When did you come?
[17:36] Just now.
[17:43] I came for you. I thought I'd take you shopping but I saw aunty is here.
[17:52] I kept telling her to get whatever you like but she insisted that Nawal's choice was a must.
[17:59] Of course. She must chose her dresses herself since she'll be wearing them.
[18:04] Now should we leave Nawal?
Yes. Sure.
[18:06] Okay.
[18:09] Alright. I'll leave now. I came for you. Since aunty is here, you can go with her.
[18:15] No. You come along. It'll help Nawal.
Yes. Come along.
[18:22] If you're insisting, I'll come along. Otherwise I was thinking I'd go back home.
[18:27] Since Aaliya leaves for work, I have to look after the house.
[18:31] Oh. If you're busy, I'll take Nawal along, it isn't a problem.
[18:36] No aunty. I'll come along. I don't want to break Nawal's heart.
[18:41] Alright. Lets go then. Bye. Come along everyone.
[18:53] What does Aaliya do, who she talks to, especially when she's talking to Kabeer, stay nearby.
[19:01] Don't worry mam.
[19:05] I gave her the money for her sick husband but I didn't realize that you'll misunderstand my good deeds as well.
[19:13] What did I do? Why are you doing this?
[19:23] You have a phobia named Falak. You're always thinking about her.
[19:28] Aaliya sometimes what we see isn't what it is. Why don't you get that?
[19:34] I am amazed at your thinking.
[19:37] You have started domestic politics just like typical middle class women.
[19:52] Mom? What happened?
Nothing dear. Nothing.
[19:58] Why are you crying? Dad is upset with you. Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[20:39] This is nice. Lovely color. What do you think Nawal?
Yes, its pretty.
[20:44] Its good but the stuff is very light.
Light? Really?
[20:50] Oh my God, this is so high priced?
[20:54] Oh. Don't worry about the price. If you like it, we'll buy it.
We'll see something else.
[20:59] Don't you like it? If not we'll see something somewhere else.
[21:07] Oh, my God. This is such a beautiful color. Look at the embroidery. Its so beautiful. Lovely Nawal.
[21:13] Look at this. do you like it?
Yes aunty. Your choice is very nice. Its better than the last one.
[21:22] Nawal, what do you think?
If you like it, we'll buy it.
[21:25] Dear, you'll be wearing it. Tell me honestly, do you like it?
[21:30] Its very beautiful but its expensive.
[21:33] Dear don't look at the price tag. Anything for my future daughter in law.
[21:36] Listen, pack this one. Its lovely. We're getting it. come, we'll see something else.
[22:11] Fariha aunty. When did you come from London?
Oh Aaliya, you..
[22:18] How are you?
I'm absolutely fine. I've been here from London since long. Its good to see you.
[22:26] Same.
Meet her. This is Saleha, my friend.
[22:28] Hello.
This is Aaliya. She's the owner of Kabeer Foods.
[22:32] Sultana's younger daughter married Kabeer, her brother in law. Sultana and Aaliya are related.
[22:39] All praise to the Lord. Nawal is a very good girl.
[22:42] Not Nawal. Falak. Her younger daughter married Kabeer.
[22:47] As far as we know, Nawal is the only child of Sultana. Falak is her servant's daughter.
[23:10] I think you're mistaken. Sultana has two daughters.
[23:14] I'm not mistaken. Sultana only has one daughter, Nawal.
[23:19] Falak is her domestic servant Sabir's daughter. Tell her Fariha. Didn't you tell her?
[23:26] Didn't Sultana tell her?
[23:28] Falak is Sultana's daughter. She brought her up.
[23:33] What are you saying?
Fariha, what do you mean she brought her up.
[23:38] I don't understand why are we discussing this here. This is between Sultana and her family.
[23:44] This is my family matter as well.
[23:46] We should discuss family matters at home. Its better that way.
[23:49] Leave everything and lets meet other people.
[23:52] Excuse me. Excuse me.
[23:56] Why did you have to say this?
[24:22] Listen. Where is Falak?
She is in her room.
[24:27] Oh wow. I think you really like me.
[24:33] That's why you're always asking about me.
Didn't I tell you?
[24:38] I'll find the truth to your lies one day.
What do you mean? What lies?
[24:47] You know everything so stop flying and come back to Earth.
[24:53] Do you know, ever since you started your cheap tactics in this house, I understood that there was something wrong.
[25:02] But I didn't know everything would be wrong.
[25:07] Your attitude, your hobbies, whatever you did.
[25:11] I had an idea you were never Nawal's sister and now,
[25:17] I know your truth. Since I know everything so..
What do you mean? What truth?
[25:26] That you're not Sultana's daughter but the daughter of his servant.
[25:34] Shut up with your nonsense.
[25:37] Will you say whatever comes in your heart?
[25:38] Shouting will get you nothing. You'll suffer if you shout.
[25:44] So you think you'll pressurize me to be proven correct?
[25:50] This isn't a lie.
[25:52] You people lied to us. You cheated us.
[25:55] The person who told me everything is not an outsider but a person from your family.
[26:04] I don't believe this 
[26:07] that you'll hate me so much that you'll want to make me fall in Kabeer's eyes by questioning my existence.
[26:14] I'm sad for you. 
[26:17] Let Touqeer and Kabeer come. We'll make a decision today.
[26:21] Yes, let them come. They should also know,
[26:24] that the person we thought was a diamond, turned out to be coal.
[26:27] Enough. I'll not tolerate any more accusations.
[26:34] What proof do you have?
[26:36] I'll give the proof when things come out in the open.
[26:41] I'll see, who is telling you to say all this. Prove that I'm not Sultana's daughter.
[26:49] Who will believe you? Touqeer? Kabeer? Nobody will trust you.
[26:57] And if you say such a thing to me next time, I'll not spare you. You'll remember.
[27:03] I'll do whatever it takes you to bring your truth to the surface.
[27:08] I will now rest when you're out of this house and Kabeer's life.
[27:16] Why not? We'll see who throws whom out and from where.
[27:21] I'll question Sultana why did she lie to us. Why did she keep us in the dark?
[27:28] Why not? Go and cross check because you'll lose this time as well. You know this.
[27:41] Should I go now?
[28:09] Didn't I tell you, I'll find the truth to your lies. 
[28:14] Your attitude, your habits showed you were never Nawal's sister.
[28:24] You are not Sultana's daughter but her servant's.
[28:28] Let Touqueer and Kabeer come. We'll decide today.
[28:32] Of course. Let them come. They should also know that the diamond we brought was only coal.
[28:40] No matter what I have to do, I'll do what it takes to throw you out of this house and Kabeer's life.
[28:55] Oh God. If Kabeer finds out, it'll be a mess.
[29:03] Aaliya, I'll destroy you. You'll remember me forever.
[29:08]  You want to throw me out of this house. You'll see what I do with you.
[29:47] Nawal is Sultana's only daughter. Falak is her servant's daughter.
[29:56] Sultana, did you tell her about Falak's true identity?
[30:00] What are you saying?
[30:02] You shouldn't hide it.
What do you want to tell?
[30:21] Mom? Mom? Mom?
[30:28] Falak, what happened? Sit here. Nawal..
[30:34] Nawal.. What happened tell me?
What happened why is she crying?
[30:37] I don't know, she's only crying and not telling me anything.
[30:42] Falak tell me what happened? If you don't tell us, how will we know?
[30:46] Aaliya knows everything. She threatened me that she'll tell everyone.
[30:52] What does she know? Tell me.
[30:56] That I'm not your real daughter.
[31:04] Who told her?
[31:07] I don't know.
[31:09] I don't know how she knows. She didn't like me and now she'll tell me. I'll lose my home.
[31:17] Nothing will happen.
[31:18] Don't worry. We'll talk to her. Mom will talk to her. Don't cry yourself.
[31:26] Please promise me, no matter what happens you'll not tell them the truth.
[31:32] Don't tell anyone. My house will be destroyed. Kabeer will leave me if he finds the truth.
[31:39] Falak, no matter what happens, you're my real daughter and Nawal's younger sister.
[31:46] Mom, why don't you believe me? Nobody will believe this.
[31:50] No. Promise me, you'll not tell anyone. Swear upon me. Just tell me you'll not tell anyone.
[32:00] Yes dear. I'll not tell anyone.
[32:04] Relax now.
Falak don't worry. We're with you.
[32:10] Be quiet.
[32:11] Mom, I'll leave. Kabeer will be home soon.
[32:14] Wait. Look at your condition.
[32:17] Mom, Kabeer must be home soon, I don't want him to know anything.
[32:21] Falak, listen to me. Falak..
[32:41] Kabeer.. What is it?
[32:46] Is Hafsa asleep?
Yes I put her to bed. 
[32:50] What is it? Are you worried?
[32:54] Brother whatever is happening in the house, its worrying me. 
[32:59] I don't understand what should I do,
[33:03] that we'll get the peace back in our house and we live like we used to. With love.
[33:12] Don't worry.
[33:15] I have talked to Aaliya. I've made her understand. Nothing will happen
[33:20] I love Falak very much.
[33:25] I cannot think about leaving her or living away from her.
[33:32] Just think of it is as that I'm because of her and Aaliya,
[33:40] I respect and care for her very much. Everybody knows that. 
[33:46] In fact I hold her in place of my mother.
[33:49] And brother, its because of Aaliya, that Falak came in this house. Its because of her that she's in my life.
[33:57] Whatever I am today, I wouldn't have been successful without Aaliya's help.
[34:08] Brother, can it not happen that Aaliya forgets all misunderstandings and we live peacefully in this house again?
[34:20] Don't worry. You'll see whatever you want will happen.
[34:26] I have talked to them both. Both of them are sensible, they'll understand and as it is,
[34:35] it is for the best for this house. 
[34:38] Let me call Aaliya. We'll talk to her in front of her.
[34:44] Aaliya?
Yes I'm coming.
[34:53] Please sit. I want to talk to you.
Please sit.
[34:58] Yes tell me.
[35:14] Falak?
[35:25] Yes?
Where were you?
[35:29] I was calling you, your phone was off.
Yes, the battery.
[35:35] Alright. Please come, sit here. We're discussing something important.
[35:49] Please sit.
[36:04] Aaliya, whatever problems we have in the house, whatever is going on in the house, we all know.
[36:12] Whatever misunderstandings and complaints that you and Falak have with one another, can you not end all that?
[36:23] Can it not happen that we live peacefully like earlier?
[36:44] What is it Aaliya? Will you not say anything?
[36:49] Aaliya you only say that if you want to shake the foundations of a house,
[36:56] we should build walls of misunderstandings. 
[37:02] Kabeer wants to knock those walls down.
[37:06] Whatever is in your heart, take it out. Everything.
[37:13] Toqueer there is nothing in my heart. My heart is all clean of the past. 
[37:18] In fact, I respect Aaliya a lot. I think of her as my sister.
[37:24] And I promise you people, I will not create any problems in this house.
[37:35] I love Falak very much. I cannot think about leaving her or living away from her.
[37:50] If both of you want the same thing, alright then.
[37:54]  I'll try to forget whatever happened in the past.
[38:00] Thank you so much, Aaliya. Falak, thank you.
[38:08] Aaliya, my heart was burdened and it was difficult to live in the house like this.
[38:16] It would be great if we can live peacefully like we used to.
