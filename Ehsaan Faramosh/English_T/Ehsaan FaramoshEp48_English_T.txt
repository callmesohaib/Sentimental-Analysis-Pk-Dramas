[00:12] You could neither become a good wife nor a good mother.
[00:15] If you knew that I am so careless then why did you send your daughter?
[00:19] I love you so much that's why I am advising you with love.
[00:24] Just do whatever I ask you to do.
[00:26] Leave my hand.
[00:28] If it comes to save your honor then quietness hurts.
[00:33] You are right.
[00:34] I don't have more money right now and my account is already out of cash.
[00:39] Falak, you told me that aunt has transferred ownership of half of her property in your name.
[00:45] I can't allow you to waste such a huge amount.
[00:48] But you can't deprive me from my right. I have legal right on everything.
[00:52] How will we know until you wont tell us?
[00:55] I wont hide anything from both of you.
[00:57] Actually the thing is that Hamza's behavior has been changed so much with me.
[01:08] My child, we asked you so many times but you didn't even tell us anything.
[01:14] I would advise him for your sake.
[01:17] Aunt, I have decided and I have already shared my decision with Hamza.
[01:23] I can't marry Hamza.
[01:26] No my child, don't make this decision. This will be wrong.
[01:29] Hamza has done injustice to you.
[01:31] I know that you are in anger but this is not the solution. This is not the right solution.
[01:35] I will talk to him and will advise him. He will never do this again.
[01:38] Please change your decision my child.
[01:40] So what's the other solution aunt?
[01:43] How long will I tolerate with his stubbornness and rudeness?
[01:47] Do you know how firmly he held my wrist?
[01:50] He shook me after holding my hand and shouted on me so loudly that I got scared.
[01:55] I was unable to understand that who is standing in front of me. He is not the same Hamza whom I love.
[02:02] Let him return, me and mom will talk to him.
[02:06] Listen Nawal, whatever the matter is, we all will resolve this together.
[02:12] Don't make such a big decision right now.
[02:15] Where has he gone?
[02:17] Didn't he tell you?
[02:19] He has gone to Canada for two or three months. There are some legal problems in his business there.
[02:25] I thought he must have met you before leaving
[02:28] Neither he informed me that he is going nor he met me before leaving.
[02:37] Mom, look at this rudeness of Hamza.
[02:41] Talk to him clearly when he comes back.
[02:44] He will have to give honor to this relation. This wont continue like this.
[02:53] Nawal, you don't have to worry, me and mom are with you. Hmm?
[03:00] Yes my child, this is unacceptable.
[03:02] Let him come back, I will talk to him very strictly. Don't worry, we are with you. Right?
[03:12] Noor,
[03:15] bring quickly. You know that she can't wait when she is hungry.
[03:20] Drink it with the name of God.
[03:37] Greetings Mr. lawyer, how are you?
[03:41] What? What are you talking about that I have asked you to sell this house?
[03:46] No, you must have some misunderstanding for sure.
[03:54] Oh I see, it's so nice of you that you informed me.
[04:11] Have you asked broker to sell this house?
[04:16] I got a call from the lawyer that broker has contacted him.
[04:21] I am asking you whether you have asked broker to sell this house?
[04:28] Yes and I told you that I need money.
[04:31] And I told you that you can't sell this house because this house belongs to both of us.
[04:35] Yes but I am not selling the whole house rather I am selling my portion only.
[04:40] And you can't stop me to do that. It's my legal right.
[04:44] How can you do this?
[04:46] We have so many sentimental attachments associated with this house.
[04:50] This house is full of our parents memories. Didn't you felt a bit about that?
[04:56] OK sister, don't taunt me that much. If you have emotional memories with this house then keep this house in your custody.
[05:03] I will transfer ownership of my share to you but in lieu of that give me the documents of plot.
[05:11] By the way, after releasing my movie I wont live in this cage like small house.
[05:15] I will buy a big house.
[05:20] Are you making a film?
[05:25] Yes.
[05:27] Please decide quickly because I can't wait for too long.
[05:58] Was your journey good and you reached there safely?
[06:02] Yes I have reached here but I went directly to office from airport and just reached home.
[06:06] Hey, you had a very long travel so you should have taken rest today.
[06:10] The first hearing is scheduled after three days. How will I win the case if I will take rest?
[06:15] OK, what's the update? How strong our case is?
[06:18] We are hopeful. Now let's see what happens.
[06:21] You didn't meet with Nawal before leaving and didn't even inform her.
[06:28] Mom I am very tired and want to take rest.
[06:33] Can I call you back later?
[06:36] OK take rest, we will talk later.
[06:39] OK bye
[07:11] OK, listen to me, I have a good news.
[07:14] I am producing my film myself and do you know who is hero in that film?
[07:20] Who?
Salaar Khan.
[07:23] Aw, what?
[07:26] Salaar Khan? Well, I will definitely come at shooting set of film.
[07:30] And Falak, promise me that you will get autograph of Salaar Khan for me at any cost.
[07:36] What a dashing personality he has. Heart says "Ah" as soon as we see him.
[07:42] And accept our congratulation in advance for success of your film.
[07:46] Give us your autograph as well. Don't forget us if you become a famous actress.
[07:50] I will see.
[07:53] See the magazine tomorrow. You have been featured in that.
[07:57] Hey wow.
[07:59] Well Maria, give us a chance as well and at least make us friend of heroine.
[08:08] Stop it.
[08:11] What is going on here?
[08:20] What is this rudeness?
Do you have any shame?
[08:25] Not much time has passed after mom's death Falak.
[08:27] Why? What have I done?
[08:29] Ask your friends to go from here right now right away.
[08:40] Why will they go? I have as much right on this house as much you have.
[08:43] I can invite anybody here and I can do whatever I want to do.
[08:46] How dare you to stop me and object on my actions?
[08:49] Falak don't let your friends come in this house ever again otherwise I will treat with you very in a very bad way.
[08:56] I think we should leave now. Let's meet some other day.
[09:01] No, stay here.
[09:05] What's the problem with you regarding my friends?
[09:07] As I have told you that I don't want to see them again here.
[09:11] Why wont they come here?
[09:13] Earlier I thought to arrange get to gather here with a gap of few months
[09:17] but how about doing it every week. Rather not every week we will do it every day. Right?
[09:24] If you have problem with their presence then go somewhere else.
[09:28] What?
[09:30] Falak you are asking me to leave this house?
[09:33] Yes, because it would be better for you.
[09:36] Because you wont be able to live here in near future.
[09:39] Until you wont transfer that plot in my name.
[10:04] I have as much right on this house as much you have.
[10:06] I can invite anyone here and I can do whatever I want to do.
[10:10] How dare you to stop me and object on my actions?
[10:15] If you have problem with their presence here then go somewhere else because it would be better for you
[10:19] because you wont be able to live here in near future.
[10:22] Until you wont transfer that plot in my name.
[10:51] Falak.
[10:53] Yes.
[10:57] I accept you condition.
[10:59] You transfer the ownership of this house in my name and I will transfer the ownership of plot in your name.
[11:08] I have no objection. You have made a very good decision.
[11:13] I will call lawyer to prepare documents.
[11:56] Miss Nawal please sign here.
[12:35] Miss Falak, please sign here.
[13:00] Miss Nawal, this is your file.
[13:08] Miss Falak, this is your file.
[13:11] Thank you Mr. lawyer.
my pleasure
[13:13] Miss Nawal from now onward you are owner of this house and Miss Falak you are owner of plot
[13:20] I have given you the documents.
[13:23] Please read these documents once please.
[13:28] Can I sell this plot now?
[13:30] Off course, you are legally owner of this plot and you can sell it whenever you want.
[13:35] I am leaving. And you can call me if you want to discuss anything. OK?
[13:42] Thank you.
Thank you.
[14:07] Hello Mr. Saleem, I have got those documents.
[14:11] Please invite that party today. I can't wait too long.
[14:15] And as I told you that I will take full payment at once so ask them to bring full amount in cash.
[14:21] OK, thank you.
[14:34] Hello Maria, I have a good news.
[14:37] I will receive cheque tomorrow.
Wow, very good Falak.
[14:42] You have arranged the amount very quickly.
[14:45] By the way, Mr. Shuja said that if Falak can't arrange the required amount then return five million to her.
[14:52] As you know that how many people want to work with him. Right?
[14:58] That's why I have sold that plot because I didn't want to miss this chance Maria.
[15:03] OK then, I will collect cheque from you any time tomorrow.
[15:08] Yes why not? But I was thinking that I haven't met with Mr. Shuja once.
[15:13] He is taking such a huge amount so it's necessary to meet him
[15:18] to see what kind of person he is and whether he is capable or not?
[15:23] Falak don't you trust me?
[15:27] There is no such thing. I trust you so much.
[15:30] And I am giving him such a huge amount because of my trust on you.
[15:34] But how is Mr. Shuja, I can only observe after meeting with him. Right?
[15:39] Yes, you have made a very good decision.
[15:42] I was about to tell you that you should meet him once and if you trust him then you give him such a huge amount.
[15:49] I will confirm time slot from him for your meeting tomorrow.
[15:53] Let's meet then.
OK, bye.
[16:16] Is it OK now? Wont there be any problem now? It's a cheque of four billion.
[16:21] You will see Falak that this decision of yours will take you so high
[16:26] and will remember me throughout your life.
[16:32] We have been waiting since long, when will Mr. Shuja come?
[16:35] Hey, you are very impatience. He is a famous personality and must be busy. He must be coming.
[16:48] There he is.
[16:52] He is the most handsome producer of the industry. He has studied abroad.
[16:56] And I have convinced him with great difficulty to work with you.
[17:04] Hello.
Hello.
[17:06] How are you Mr. Shuja?
I am fine. How about both of you?
[17:11] And I guess that you must be miss Falak. Right?
[17:17] I saw you from far. The most beautiful girl in this ambiance can only be miss Falak.
[17:24] Maria praised you so much and after seeing you it seems that all of that was not a lie.
[17:32] You speak so well.
My pleasure.
[17:37] I was telling Falak that you have a very busy schedule.
[17:40] Yes, I am working on a movie and I am busy in script, casting and all such stuff.
[17:45] And who is the hero?
[17:48] Didn't Maria tell you? It's Salaar Khan. There is no one except him in this industry.
[17:53] I only say one thing that if you will invest money then you will be able to earn money.
[17:58] If the script is good, casting is A class,
[18:01] locations are beautiful and direction by Emad then no one can stop the film to become a hit.
[18:06] Yes you are right.
[18:08] When will shooting start?
[18:10] Script is under writing and that will be finalized within this month
[18:14] and pre-production will also start after that.
[18:17] OK, so when will I get the script?
[18:20] As soon as that will be finalized I will send you the copy of that.
[18:25] There are six songs on you miss Falak so you will have to start practicing for dance as well.
[18:31] In fact I am thinking to ask my choreographer to have rehearsal sessions with you at your home.
[18:37] What do you think about that?
[18:39] Actually this is Falak's first project Mr. Shuja,
[18:42] she wanted to meet you and wanted to see, lest her investment will go in vain.
[18:48] So miss Falak, what do you think?
[18:51] After meeting with you, I am so impressed that I can say that my investment wont go in vain.
[18:56] Miss Falak, just consider that I am making this film only for you.
[19:02] And I remember Falak, give me your passport so that I can apply for your visa processing. OK.
[19:12] Mr. Shuja please have some.
[19:13] No, I am sorry. Actually I have some other meetings so I have to leave.
[19:17] You guys carry on please.
[19:19] Hey no, at least sit with us for a while.
[19:21] It's not possible today. Please visit my office any day so we will have a chat there.
[19:26] Yes sure, why not.
OK Maria see you.
[19:29] See you.
[19:37] Drink.
[19:39] I can hear her crying voice outside. Is she hungry?
[19:42] I don't know madam. I have tried to feed her but she is not drinking.
[19:46] Maybe she drinks from my hand. Have you called Kabir?
[19:49] Yes, I have just talked to him. He is about to reach home.
[19:52] She is not drinking. When did you make this?
[19:54] I have just made this a while ago.
[19:55] Go and make a fresh one quickly. Maybe she drinks that.
OK, I will bring that.
[19:59] Good girl. Just wait for a second. Right.
[20:30] Your dialed number is busy at the moment. Please try later.
[20:46] Your dialed number is powered off. Please try later.
[21:08] Hello Maria, where are you? I have been calling you since long. Why is your number switched off?
[21:20] What happened? Is she feeling alright?
[21:21] No, perhaps she was hungry. She is absolutely alright.
[21:26] Have Noor called you and asked you to come here?
[21:28] I was passing by so I thought to meet Ilham.
[21:32] You did good. Thank you so much.
[21:34] Why are you thanking me. As much as she is dear to you she is dear to me as well.
[21:39] And please don't do such formality to thank me again.
[21:49] If you would have obeyed me then you wouldn't suffer this loss.
[21:53] But all of this has happened because of you.
[21:55] You put your jealous sight on me.
[21:57] Everything was going very smoothly but that ruined suddenly.
[22:20] Hello Maria, where are you? I have been calling you since long. Why is your number switched off?
[22:41] OK, Maria I want to talk to you. Please call me.
[22:48] OK, Maria I want to talk to you. Please call me.
[23:05] What's this? She has blocked my number.
[23:59] Well.
Excuse me, with whom do you want to meet?
[24:03] I want to meet Maria.
Maria has left the job.
[24:07] What do you mean? When?
[24:11] It's almost two months.
[24:13] Two months? But she didn't tell me about that.
[24:16] You should ask Maria about it that why didn't she tell you?
[24:21] By the way, what's your name?
[24:23] I am Falak.
[24:26] Oh, so you are Falak.
[24:31] Listen miss Falak, our agency has suffered a very huge loss because of you.
[24:35] Because you didn't complete any of your project and we have convinced another ad agency for a new girl.
[24:42] What? How can you say that? What are you talking about?
[24:47] I am telling you what is the reality.
[24:49] Please do one thing and go from here.
[24:52] Because if boss will see you then he will ask police to arrest you.
[24:56] How can he do that? I have invested billions of rupees.
[25:01] Investment of billions of rupees? With whom?
[25:04] With Mr. Shuja. He was making a movie and I have produced that and I have invested in that.
[25:10] Mr. Shuja? Maria's boyfriend? He is a number one fraudster.
[25:15] And I would advise you to please stay away from him.
[25:19] What are you saying?
[25:22] I am telling you what is reality.
I don't know her boyfriend.
[25:26] I am talking about Mr. Shuja, who is a producer and a director.
[25:29] He was making a movie with me.
I am talking about same Shuja.
[25:33] He is not a director or a producer.
[25:36] In fact he was trying to get some work and Maria also tried so hard for him.
[25:41] She has talked with boss as well but boss knew about his frauds.
[25:46] And he has taken money from so many people for making fake serials and movies.
[25:55] Hello, yes boss. Yes I am coming. Excuse me.
[26:46] If you have emotional memories attached with this house then keep this house.
[26:50] By the way, I wont live in this small house after releasing of my movie.
[26:55] You live in this cage like house.
[27:21] What are you thinking so deeply?
[27:25] No, I was just standing here.
[27:32] Are you sure?
I thought that you are in a deep thought.
[27:38] It's OK, no problem if you don't want to tell me.
[27:42] But if there is any issue then you can share with me.
[27:46] Trust me I wont give you any wrong advice.
[27:51] I was thinking about Falak.
[27:58] I told you that mom has transferred ownership of half property to her name.
[28:05] So she has sold her property and invested all money in producing a movie.
[28:10] She is investing such a huge amount without taking advice from anyone at a place where she has no experience.
[28:18] I am sorry but I can't give any advice in this matter.
[28:23] What does she want to do and what is she doing, I have nothing to do with that.
[28:30] Kabir I have tried very hard to make her understand,
[28:34] I know that it's of no use that she doesn't listen to anyone but
[28:38] she is wasting mom and dad's hard earned property like this. I feel really sad.
[28:46] I will only say one thing about this
[28:50] there are some people who don't get any good effect from good companionship.
[28:58] I would advise you to stop thinking about her.
[29:02] No matter how much you will advise her, she wont understand.
[29:09] Sir, it's time for meeting and everyone is waiting for you.
[29:12] OK, we are coming.
[29:14] OK sir thank you.
[29:18] Let's go.
[29:27] You can be such a big fool, I didn't have any idea about that.
[29:31] You gave her such a huge amount.
[29:33] Without asking from anyone and without talking to anyone.
[29:37] At least you should have talked to me.
[29:39] As I told you that I am producing a movie.
[29:44] You told me that you are producing a movie but you are investing such a huge amount,
[29:49] you didn't tell me about this.
[29:51] Maria said to me that I will have to invest half amount.
[29:56] I didn't know that she will run away by taking my money and that Shuja will be with her.
[30:02] Falak I must say that I didn't see such a big fool than you in my whole life.
[30:08] And if you didn't want to talk to us then you should have crossed check at your end.
[30:12] That the person you are trusting blindly and giving such a huge amount.
[30:16] Is he capable of being trusted or not?
[30:21] I met with him and he seemed to me a trust worthy guy.
[30:25] I didn't know that this will happen. I was so excited.
[30:29] Really? Did you get information about him?
[30:32] Do you know, media industry is so small, if you would ask from anyone about him then you would have revealed his secret.
[30:43] I forgot to do that. 
[30:46] What do I do my God? I will go mad and my head will explode.
[30:52] O God, I have lost all my money.
[30:54] Anam please give me a favor. Ask someone about whereabouts of Maria.
[31:02] Yes, let me ask.
[31:13] Hello Hania, how are you? 
[31:16] I am absolutely fine.
[31:18] Yes I was busy in my work. I was also thinking about a meeting plan.
[31:24] Hania, tell me one thing.
[31:27] Can you tell me about Maria? Her number is switched off 
[31:30] and I have to discuss something really important with her. 
[31:34] But she.. What?
[31:38] When?
[31:42] O God, no nothing. Everything is fine. See you. Bye.
[31:50] What happened? What was she saying?
[31:52] She said that she has gone to Dubai from today's morning flight.
[31:58] O God, my money. May God ruin her.
[32:06] Listen to me. Don't cry. Crying wont benefit you. My uncle is a DSP in police.
[32:13] Do I talk to him about this issue?
[32:18] Let me message him. At least something will happen.
[32:26] How was your meeting and what was the response?
[32:29] Thanks to God, much more than my expectation. 
[32:33] I didn't have any idea that here is a great demand of Pakistani leather.
[32:36] Rather me and Farhan are planning to open a company office here God willing.
[32:39] And I have also finalized a place for office and work will be started from tomorrow.
[32:43] Congratulations. This is really a great news.
[32:48] Yes, just see that I have just come here but so many investors have contacted me and want to work with us.
[32:57] That's great.
[32:59] This is a very good news. Do you know, I was a bit worried about the response.
[33:04] I was also very worried 
[33:06] but after coming here and after meetings with everyone, all my worries went away.
[33:14] By the way Aliya I was thinking that once our business get established here then 
[33:18] I wind up my business in Pakistan because here are more chances to grow business then in Pakistan.
[33:25] And I was thinking that we will shift here after that. What do you say?
[33:29] Yes, but all these things can be discussed later. 
[33:33] Just finish your meetings and come back quickly. We all are missing you so much.
[33:40] Aliya, let me call you back. I am getting a very important call.
[33:43] OK, bye.
[33:52] Zakia.
[33:56] Yes madam Nawal.
[33:59] Make a cup of tea for me. I have a severe head ache.
[34:02] OK I will make that.
[34:05] Do I tell you one thing madam Nawal?
Hmm.
[34:09] Someone has done fraud with madam Falak.
[34:13] What? Who has told you?
[34:15] I went there to give her water, I listened all the conversation from outside the room. 
[34:19] She is very worried and she was crying so much.
[34:22] And madam Anam was scolding her so much 
[34:24] that why was the need to give her such a huge amount and that too without asking from anyone.
[34:28] The director of her film has run away by taking her money.
[34:37] What am I hearing? 
[34:40] Your friend Maria has done fraud with you?
[34:45] Yes, she has fled to Dubai after taking my money.
[34:50] I told you.
[34:51] I forbade you that don't do this but you didn't listen to me. 
[34:55] Are you in peace now after getting such a huge loss?
[34:59] If you would have obeyed me then you wouldn't suffered from this loss.
[35:02] But all of this has happened because of you.
[35:04] You put your jealous sight on me. 
[35:07] Everything was going on so smoothly but that ruined suddenly.
[35:11] Because of me?
[35:12] What have I done? I wanted to save you from this loss.
[35:17] If you would want to save me from this loss
[35:19]  then you should have hold my hand and forcefully stopped me from doing all this.
[35:23] You must be feeling happy that it's good that she takes her share and get lost from this house.
[35:27] No, no, don't blame me.
[35:29] I forbade you and stopped you from doing this but you didn't listen to me. 
[35:34] All of this is happening because of your stubbornness and arrogant nature.
[35:41] Have you lodged a complain in police?
[35:45] No.
[35:46] What do you mean by no? How will you get your money back if you wont lodge any complain?
[35:52] It's my problem whether I get my money back or not.
[35:55] At the moment I just want you to leave me alone and leave this room.
[35:59] Because if you can't cure my wounds then don't pour salt on those. Please go from here. Go.
[36:28] How was the hearing? What do lawyers say? 
[36:31] When will the court make the decision?
[36:33] Obviously it will take some time. Don't you worry, I will handle.
[36:37] I know you will handle everything but think as well that business is being here as well.
[36:44] No it's not, don't worry. I am in touch.
[36:47] Well, I wanted to discuss something with you for last few days.
[36:50] Yes what's up? I am listening.
[36:53] Nawal, has told me that your behavior is not good with her and you treated her very rudely.
[36:58] I didn't do that. I forbade her to go Kabir's office 
[37:02] but she didn't listened to me. So tell me what should have I done?
[37:05] That doesn't mean that you behave rudely with her my child 
[37:09] and dragged her out by holding her hand.
[37:12] When I heard that then I felt ashamed and sad.
[37:17] So she has told you everything.
[37:19] Do you have any idea that what has happened because this action of yours?
[37:23] She has refused to get married.
[37:26] Don't take her words that serious.
[37:28] Her refusal has no value. She will get married to me only. 
[37:32] I will handle everything when I come back.
[38:20] Hello.
What did you tell mom?
[38:25] Nothing, I didn't tell her anything.
[38:28] Listen Nawal, I told you a straight forward thing.
[38:31] That I don't like Kabir and you wont go to his office.
[38:34] You have started to complain against me in front of mom and sister.
[38:38] This matter is between you and me so why are you involving my family in it?
[38:43] I didn't make any complain.
[38:45] They asked me so I told them and why are you exaggerating this issue?
[38:50] Am I exaggerating or you?
[38:52] If you accept my condition then there will be no issue.
[38:55] Hamza it's not just a matter of going to office, it's matter of my self respect
[39:00]  and I wont compromise on my self respect for anyone.
[39:03]  And if you wont change your behavior with me then forget me.
[39:07] Nawal, don't test my patience.
