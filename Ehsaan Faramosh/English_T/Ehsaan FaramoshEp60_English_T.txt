[01:05] Nazish please, don't go. This house is as much yours as its mine.
[01:11] Had this been my house, she wouldn't have taunted me so much.
[01:26] Hamza..
[01:29] You have brought a big problem and made it sit on our heads.
[01:43] We cannot do anything else except regretting our mistakes.
[01:57] By the way, why do you take what she says seriously?
[02:03] She's a stupid and emotional girl. She doesn't have any sense.
[02:22] That's what I'm told her a thousand times. She shouldn't value what Falak says
[02:28] but she isn't listening to me Hamza. She wants to go back.
[02:40] I will not listen to you. That girl taunted me so much
[02:46] and she misbehaved with me in front of Hamza.
[02:49] She apologized in front of me as well.
[02:52] Apologize? Whats the use of such an apology? I've been so hurt with what she said.
[03:08] I promise, she will never misbehave with you.
[03:22] And if she does, I'll let her go.
[03:49] Hamza your emotional talks cannot stop me, its very late.
[03:56] I have taken my decision and I'll not change my decision now.
[05:15] What happened? Why are you looking at me like that?
[05:19] I'm watching how people can change so fast.
[05:23] What do you mean? What are you trying to say?
[05:27] I heard what you said.
[05:31] Tell me the truth Hamza, do you think marrying me was a mistake?
[05:39] Were you listening to our talk?
[05:41] I coincidentally walked by and heard you.
[05:47] You talked about letting me go so easily and that whatever I say shouldn't be valued?
[05:58] And also that I'm a stupid, emotional girl.
[06:02] Do you really think this about me?
[06:08] Isn't it so?
[06:12] Its because of you that Nazish has decided to leave this house.
[06:19] How many times did I tell you not to argue with me but you didn't listen to me.
[06:26] Even after mom and I tried explaining it to her, she isn't listening and she's leaving.
[06:36] Do you know how much loss will I incur if she leaves?
[06:40] But its no use explaining it to you because you'll not understand.
[06:47] If you had even a little bit of sense, you'd have listened to me.
[06:52] She decided to leave herself and the mistake I made, I apologized for it in front of everyone.
[07:01] But still if you want I'll go and beg her and try to make her stop.
[07:07] There's no need for it nor it will be of any use.
[07:14] Because she will not change her decision.
[07:57] You have brought a big problem and made us sit on our heads.
[08:05] Had this house been mine, she wouldn't have taunted me.
[08:09] We cannot do anything except regret a few mistakes.
[08:18] By the way, you don't have to take anything she says seriously.
[08:23] She's a stupid and emotional girl. She has no sense at all.
[08:40] I promise that she'll never misbehave with you again and if she does that, I'll let her go.
[09:18] This confidence that you have, I'll snatch it from you.
[09:22] You'll never be able to complete this project.
[09:26] I will bother you so much that you'll be forced to let this project go.
[09:32] I'll take away whatever leftover respect that you have.
[09:46] Falak has sent us a court notice for Ilham's custody.
[09:49] She has alleged that I have remarried,
[09:55] that's why her step mother, you, cannot look after her.
[10:00] This is why she's asking for her custody back.
[10:10] Whatever happens, I will not let Ilham back to Falak. Okay?
[10:33] Nazish called, a little while ago, she has reached Canada safely.
[10:37] But Hamza she's very upset because of Falak.
[10:43] Mom, leave this topic. Let it go.
[10:50] Nawal is calling.. Why is she calling me?
[10:54] Answer. See what she says.
[10:58] Hello? Yes Nawal tell me. Why did you call?
[11:04] I want to talk to Falak and Hamza.
[11:07] Then call them, why are you calling me?
[11:09] Because I want you to know what they're doing. That's why I want to talk in your presence.
[11:17] Here, Falak is here, talk to her.
[11:22] Please put me on speaker.
[11:24] Wait, I'll turn on the speaker.
[11:28] Nawal wants to talk to you.
[11:31] How dare you call here?
[11:34] You think you can do and get whatever you want?
[11:38] You're mistaken. Don't think I'm the same Nawal.
[11:45] What is it Nawal? Why are you so angry?
[11:48] Your daughter in law has sent me a notice.
[12:00] What?
[12:03] Notice?
[12:11] Yes, for Ilham's custody.
[12:17] You're doing wrong.
[12:21] What are we doing wrong? Ilham is my daughter and I want to keep her with me. You cannot stop me.
[12:27] Daughter? What daughter?
[12:29] The same that you left all alone in the hospital like an orphan or the daughter
[12:33] you've never looked back upon ever since you got married for the second time.
[12:39] What do you want to prove by all this?
[12:42] That you've only given birth to her. I'm bringing her up like her mother. You left her crying.
[12:49] How dare you claim a right on her?
How dare you claim a right to her?
[12:58] Nawal, no matter what you do. You'll always be her step mother, not her birth mother.
[13:07] And that's why my daughter will live me with me, nobody can stop her now.
[13:12] You'll fall on your faces. If you think I'll give you Ilham so easily, you're mistaken.
[13:23] You cannot do anything Nawal. Court will decide.
[13:27] Its better to prepare for the case rather than venting out on us.
[13:31] You are a cheap and small man who will go to any lengths for his gain.
[13:41] Shut up. We'll talk in the court. Put the phone down.
[13:52] What nonsense is this?!
[14:10] Who allowed you to file a custody case and bring your daughter in this house?
[14:19] Mom, please don't start now.
[14:23] Wait Hamza. Let me answer her.
[14:26] You always taunt me that I left my daughter there and that I'm not a good mother.
[14:33] Now I'm doing the right thing. I'm bringing my daughter to me, why are you objecting to this now?
[14:38] Because I have tolerated you with so much difficulty.
[14:43] Now I'll have to tolerate your daughter as well.
[14:48] Hamza, finish this chapter right here.
[14:51] Mom its her right. She is her mother. Its her right to keep her daughter with her.
[14:57] You are now testing my patience. Her daughter will not come in this house. She'll not!
[15:07] Mom, I have thought this through before deciding. I'll not back out.
[15:13] Alright then, I'll go to my daughter in Canada.
[15:17] You keep her and her daughter here and be happy.
[15:20] Because I will not tolerate it any further.
What is this? What are you saying?
[15:31] What is all this?
[15:53] Falak..
[15:55] Falak please look at her. She's crying.
[15:57] Look at her yourself. She's your child as well, not only mine.
[16:03] Falak whats wrong with you? I have to go to the office. I have to wake up early.. Come on..
[16:08] I go to work too.
[16:11] Falak she's hungry.
Kabeer look at it yourself.
[16:19] I couldn't say no, there was no reason to say no. I'm getting fame and money.
[16:24] Falak who'll take care of Ilham?
[16:26] The maid is there. She'll take care of her.
[16:38] Before you take Ilham, give me my alimony and then you can take your daughter.
[17:03] Why are you sitting all alone?
[17:09] Why are you worried? If God wills, everything will be alright.
[17:17] Our daughter is a link to keep us together.
[17:21] We're a family because of her.
[17:25] If God wills, this will always be.
[17:34] Do you know Nawal,
[17:36] your support is the biggest encouragement for me?
[17:45] Its the same for me as well.
[17:50] We'll figure it out.
[17:55] As God wills.
[18:19] What will we do now, Hamza? Don't tell me we'll take the case back?
[18:24] Don't worry. We will not take the case back.
[18:28] I'll handle mom.. Don't worry.
[19:32] Thank God, He saved me.
[19:35] You know my mom always said that matches are made in heaven.
[19:40] A person always gets a life partner like himself.
[19:52] Daughter? What daughter? The one you left like an orphan in the hospital or the one,
[19:59] that you forgot about once you married again.
[20:08] You only gave birth to her.
[20:10] I'm bringing her up like a mother. You left her crying. How dare you claim a right to her now?!
[20:21] You're doing wrong. You'll fall on your face.
[20:24] If you think I'll give you Ilham so easily, you're mistaken.
[21:02] Whatever I was afraid of, happened. Falak didn't accept that she signed it willingly.
[21:10] So what will we do ahead?
[21:12] Don't worry. The case will go on. We'll see what happens next.
[21:19] The allegations that Falak filed, there's no proof.
[21:24] We might need the witnesses again. The court needs proofs.
[21:30] Saying things verbally don't make a claim.
[21:32] Didn't I ask you Mr. Kabeer that we should be adding a few things as well. It'll make our case strong.
[21:39] No.
[21:41] We will play it clearly. We will not falsely accuse anyone to win the case.
[21:49] You should see. Our case could be stronger.
[21:51] Didn't I tell you? We're not doing this. Just talk about the facts.
[21:57] As God wills.
[21:59] Alright. I'll need a few documents in the next hearing. You'll have to arrange them. Come.
[22:08] I'll come..
[22:24] Alright sir, I'll see you in the evening. We'll talk in detail.
[22:28] Alright. Bye.
[22:32] You go ahead in the car, I'll come.
[23:22] You?
[23:24] Yes. I saw you standing alone so I came to you.
[23:32] What happened? You look worried.
[23:38] Are you tired?
[23:43] Its best if you leave.
Oh..
[23:47] So much anger? Keep some of your anger safe.
[23:53] It'll come handy in the future. Its just the beginning.
[24:00] A lot will happen in the future. Didn't I tell you, I'll bother you a lot.
[24:07] I'll make you pine.
[24:09] You're doing very wrong.
[24:14] Am I wrong?
Yes.
[24:17] I want to see both of you broken and defeated.
[24:25] And I'll do whatever I need to do for that.
[24:29] As they say, everything is fair in love and war.
[24:37] I want to see defeat and hopelessness on your face.
[24:42] Yes I am hopeless Hamza. After I saw your real face.
[24:49] I don't believe I wasted so many years loving a man like you.
[24:56] I curse myself. I feel nauseated by myself.
[25:01] I will make you fall on your face.
[25:07] Do whatever you want to do.
[25:09] You'll not win the battle because your intentions are not honest.
[25:16] And where there is dishonesty, God takes away all the bounties from there.
[25:20] Everything will backfire on you.
[25:25] Remember my words.
[25:28] We'll see. Its just the beginning.
[25:54] Its just the beginning. A lot remains to happen.
[25:58] Didn't I tell you, I'll bother you very much.
[26:03] I'll make you pine.
[26:06] I want to see you both defeated and broken.
[26:10] And I'll do whatever I can for that. As they say..
[26:17] everything is fair in love and war.
[26:22] I want to see helplessness and hopelessness on your face. I'll go to any lengths for that.
[26:42] What are you thinking, Nawal?
[26:48] Nothing. I'm just worried.
[26:52] I don't think Hamza has good intentions.
[26:55] What do you feel? What more could he do?
[27:04] He is wired up because he didn't get the tender and such a man can hurt anyone.
[27:15] You go in and out. Take care, God forbid if something..
[27:29] Nawal.. He will not hurt anyone except himself and Falak. Nothing will happen to me.
[27:39] As it is, I have you and your prayers with me. Just relax.
[27:48] Nothing will happen.
But still.. please be careful.
[28:04] What?! What do you want to say?
[28:08] We have very few chances of winning the case.
[28:11] We couldn't prove anything in today's hearing.
[28:16] Neither the allegations on Kabeer nor the fact that he cannot take care of his daughter.
[28:24] Why didn't you tell me Ms. Falak handed over Ilham's custody in exchange for money?
[28:34] See Mr. Hamza, I want to tell you clearly, we have nothing in our case. Please listen to me.
[28:41] You won't lose this case at any cost.
[28:45] I want to win this case at all costs.
[28:49] We can win the case but..
[28:53] But what..
[28:55] But we'll have to prove something in the court that'll tell that,
[29:02] Kabeer is an irresponsible man and he cannot take care of his daughter.
[29:07] I don't understand. Tell me clearly.
[29:10] If you want to win the case, we need a solid reason.
[29:13] Like what?
If you want the decision in your favor, we need his weakness.
[29:20] A weak point we can play on.
[30:19] Ilham..
[30:23] Nawal.. What happened?
[30:29] I had a nightmare.
[30:33] Someone was snatching Ilham from us and she was screaming in pain.
[30:39] It was just a nightmare. Nobody can take Ilham away from us. If Ilham sees this, she'll be worried.
[30:50] Kabeer, doesn't she pity this innocent soul?
[30:53] Why does someone want to take her away from us?
Nawal...
[30:59] Ilham is our daughter and nobody can take our daughter away from us.
[31:08] Kabeer lets go somewhere. In another country, where all this doesn't happen.
[31:18] We will go to Aaliya and Toqueer and nobody will be able to take our daughter away from us..
[31:25] Nawal..
[31:27] Please calm down. 
[31:29] Until we have our case, we cannot go anywhere. 
[31:34] You're just being superstitious, nobody will takeaway our daughter from us.
[31:42] Calm down..
I feel anxious. I feel as if something bad is about to happen.
[31:51] Nothing bad will happen Nawal. You're just being superstitious. 
[31:57] If God wills, our daughter will stay with us.
[32:01] Nobody can take her away from us. Okay? Now lay down..
[32:24] Relax and try to sleep..
[33:08] After today's hearing, everything is clear. 
[33:12] We couldn't prove anything. Neither the allegations on Kabeer and nor,
[33:18] that Kabeer cannot look after his daughter.
[33:23] Why didn't you tell me that Ms. Falak has handed over Ilham's custody in exchange for money?
[33:38] We will have to prove that Kabeer is an irresponsible man, in the court.
[33:47] And he cannot take care of his daughter.
[33:55] Do whatever you want, you will not win this battle. All your tactics will befall you.
[34:04] Remember my words.
[34:19] If you want to get the decision in your favor, we need his weakness. 
[34:24] A weak point that we can play on.
[36:36] And look at this.. Excuse me..
[36:43] Hello?
Kabeer.. They took our daughter...
[36:48] What happened to Ilham?
They.....
[36:53] What?! Who took Ilham? Who are you talking about?
[36:57] They took our daughter..
[37:00] Where are you?
I'm sending you my location. Come.. My daughter...
[37:06] I'll just come.
What happened Kabeer?
[37:10] Nawal called. Someone has kidnapped Ilham..
What?!
[37:54] They took my daughter.. My baby...
Relax...
[38:00] I have blockades in the entire city. Don't worry, they'll not go far.
[38:05] Your daughter will be found soon.
[38:07] Please found my daughter. No matter how!
[38:10] She's very young. How will she stay without me?
[38:14] We're trying our best.
[38:16] Tell me, how did this happen? Do you know someone? Did you see someone's face? Any car number?
[38:24] No. I didn't see anyone. No number plate.
[38:29]  I was keeping the bags in the car after shopping. A bike stopped suddenly..
[38:34] and they took Ilham.. I couldn't stop them.
[38:39] Such kidnappings happen for ransom.
[38:42] Tell me do you have any doubts. Someone who could do this?
[38:48] I have no doubts.. We have no enemies..
