[01:28] Mom..
My doll..
[01:31] My dear, you didn't come and meet me?
[01:36] Dad said not to disturb you. Mom what happened to you?
[01:41] Nothing. I'm absolutely fine now.
[01:45] Mom, why were you locked up in your room since so many days.
[01:50] You didn't come out. I wanted to play with you. Nobody took me out.
[01:57] Even your uncle didn't take you?
[02:01] Aunt doesn't like it so he didn't take me.
[02:07] So lets do one thing. I'll take you out.
When?
[02:13] Today. Right now.
Really mom?
[02:18] My dear. Nasreen, get her clothes. Get her ready. Ask the driver to get the car ready, we'll leave.
[02:25] Alright mam. Do you want me to iron your dress?
[02:28] Yes. Of course. Hurry up. And when did you make this. I didn't see it.
[03:30] Hello.
Hello. How are you?
[03:33] I'm fine. How are you? Please come and sit.
[03:45] I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
I'm Hamza's mother.
[03:52] You know Hamza. Nawal works for him in his office.
[03:57] Yes I know.
[03:59] Its good. I'll not drag it. Actually,
[04:05] I brought a proposal for Nawal from Hamza. Hamza wants to marry her.
[04:11] But Nawal doesn't want to marry him.
[04:14] She doesn't want to hear Hamza's name.
[04:18] I know. Even Hamza knows.
[04:22] Whatever happened in the past, he has apologized to Nawal a lot of times but,
[04:29] I'm a mother like you. He's embarrassed but he loves Nawal very much. He'll keep her happy.
[04:36] Please ask Nawal to end this separation. It will be for the best. Ask her to forgive Hamza.
[04:45] I'll talk to Nawal. I'll try to make her understand.
[04:52] And I'll tell you what she says.
[04:56] My son is not bad.
[04:59] He is a good human being. He made a mistake and he is repenting it.
[05:06] I understand what you're saying. I'll talk to Nawal.
[05:10] But I'll not force her.
[05:14] I have seen the consequences of forcing her once. My daughter has been hurt.
[05:23] I understand what you're saying.
[05:25] But I hope if you talk, everything will be alright. We'll meet again, soon. If God wills.
[05:32] But you didn't even have tea.
[05:35] Please sit, I'll get tea.
[05:37] No please don't be formal. Next time we'll have sweets. Alright?
[05:44] I'll take you leave. Bye.
[05:51] I'm a lot better. I'm fine now. I'll join from tomorrow.
[05:57] Please keep my meetings for the second half.
[06:01] I'm good. Okay. Bye.
[06:09] Oh wow. You're getting ready to go to work.
[06:15] Yes. I've been in my room for long.
[06:20] I've thought I'll get worried if I let this problem worry me.
[06:32] I just made a mistake Falak.
[06:36] I thought my enemy was weak and I lost.
[06:42] Its good.
[06:43] Human beings make mistake. Be careful next time.
[06:49] I have put in a lot of love and hard work to make this house, a home.
[06:59] I will not let you break this house apart so easily.
[07:03] God forbid, what are you saying.
[07:06] This house is mine as much as its yours. Why would I break it?
[07:15] Falak, I'm waiting for you outside and you're talking to sister Aalia.
Sister Aalia, how are you now?
[07:22] I'm fine. You tell me, hows work?
[07:26] Everything is going fine but we miss you there.
[07:31] I'll join tomorrow by the grace of God. I've rested enough. I need to work.
[07:40] Do you know, as much as Falak looked after me, she cared for me, that's why I'm up on my feet so soon.
[07:50] I think if it had been my own sister, she wouldn't have cared for me so much. Isn't it Falak?
[07:56] Thank you so much.
[08:01] I'm so pleased to see you so fresh and healthy.
Are you people going somewhere?
[08:08] Yes we're going out.
[08:10] Alright. Take Falak on a long drive first and then dinner.
[08:18] Falak loves long drives. Isn't it?
[08:21] Whatever you say. Lets go Falak.
[08:26] Now won't you meet me before you leave?
[08:38] Enjoy.
[08:43] Bye.
[09:08] You know I won't marry him even if he's the last man on Earth.
[09:17] Don't make such tall claims.
[09:21] If someone is coming to your doorstep again and again
[09:25] and if you aren't finding anybody else, what does this mean?
[09:29] This means, this is God's way of bringing you together.
[09:33] You know what he did with me and still you're saying this?
[09:39] I know. He made a mistake and now he is repenting.
[09:48] See dear, if someone apologizes, don't hold them accountable.
[09:56] Its best if you forgive them.
[10:00] I will forgive him but I'll not marry him.
[10:03] Then don't.
[10:06] Don't marry him. But take time and think about your decision.
[10:12] Think about it first, understand and I'll accept whatever decision you make.
[10:34] When someone is coming to your doorstep again and again, and you're not finding anybody else what does it mean?
[10:40] It means its God's way of bringing you together. He made a mistake.
[10:46] And now he's repenting.
[10:49] If someone apologizes, don't hold them accountable.
[11:20] Hello?
[11:21] Even when I said no, why did you send your mom? You know my answer.
[11:28] I know but I don't accept it and neither will I ever accept your no.
[11:36] I know Nawal, you're hurt and upset with me. I promise I'll make everything alright.
[11:43] Just trust me once.
How? How can I trust you?
[11:50] What if you break my trust once again?
[11:55] I promise I'll never break it again.
[11:58] Just give me a chance.
I gathered myself with a lot of difficulty.
[12:07] I don't have the strength to go through pain once again.
[12:11] Nawal I'll make up for whatever pain I caused you.
[12:17] I'll love you so much that you'll forget everything.
[12:20] Its all talks. Nobody can make up for the pain they caused in the past.
[12:25] Just give me one chance and listen to me. We can sort this out together.
[12:36] Please Nawal. Meet me once. Please.
[12:51] I'll wait for you at the same place tomorrow. The same place we used to meet.
[13:00] If you still think that we cannot be together, I'll not come in your way again. I promise.
[14:11] Hello Ms. Nawal. How are you?
[14:15] Move out of my way.
[14:18] Oh, so Mr. Hamza is here as well?
[14:27] Now I understand everything. Whatever you had with me was a drama. You had an affair with him.
[14:38] You were cheating on me. You needed an excuse and as soon as you found one, you called it off. Isn't it?
[14:47] I am not answerable to you. Think whatever you want to think.
[14:53] You broke it off. I didn't.
[15:02] Whatever you're dreaming about, I'll not let you fulfill it.
[15:04] Leave her hand. How dare you touch her?
[15:09] If I see you near her again, I'll spoil your face.
[15:20] Hamza.
If I want, I'll kill the two of you right here.
[15:32] I think you don't hold your life dear. Its best if you keep your gun inside.
[15:36] Or else my guards will fire at you.
[15:47] I'll see the two of you.
[15:55] Let him go.
[16:05] Nawal? Its alright. He's gone.
[16:10] Don't be scared.
[16:13] You don't have to be scared when I'm here. I'm with you.
[16:19] I want to go home.
Its alright. Come with me. I'll drop you.
[16:23] No. I'll go myself.
You come with me. They'll bring your car.
[16:31] Come on. Its okay. Come.
[16:53] Thank you.
Bye.
[17:43] The servant was telling me that Touqeer took you to a psychiatrist?
[17:52] But you said no to the check up.
[17:57] What has your condition become in a few days?
[18:02] An empty mind is a devil's workshop.
[18:06] What do you keep thinking all day? Why don't you do anything productive?
[18:11] So that you can do something good for yourself and others.
[18:14] What will you get like this except destroying people and your own self?
[18:20] You're so upset. Your moves overturned on you.
[18:26] You're always thinking about one thing.
[18:29] What if Kabeer leaves us?
[18:32] Kabeer will not go anywhere, no matter how much you try and I believe it.
[18:38] You will not succeed in your attempts. I know how to answer you well.
[18:47] But the problem is I cannot fall down to your level. Its not in my upbringing.
[19:16] Don't worry. All your misunderstandings will be cleared in a few days.
[19:22] I'll not let you take over my husband, sister Aaliya.
[19:38] I understand everything. Whatever you had with me was a drama. You had an affair with him.
[19:51] I'll never let you fulfill the dreams you're having.
[19:54] Leave her hand. How dare you touch her? If I see you near her, ever again, I'll destroy you.
[20:18] What are you thinking Nawal?
[20:23] Mom, I went to meet Hamza. I met Asjad there. He drew out a pistol.
[20:30] Pistol?
[20:32] Thank God Hamza was with me. God knows what would have happened then.
[20:35] You went to meet Hamza without telling me.
[20:39] What was Asjad doing there?
[20:42] Will you take decisions without telling me?
[20:47] I.. am nothing mom.
[20:54] And whatever happened today, I'm scared mom.
[21:00] I went to meet Hamza because he forced me but I don't know where Asjad came from.
[21:09] Nawal thats why I want you to get married.
[21:13] Nawal, a woman needs security.
[21:18] And that security can only be provided by a man.
[21:23] My life isn't to be trusted anymore. I might be not around to see tomorrow.
[21:30] That's why I want you to get married while I'm alive. I'm just scared.
[21:39] Don't think I think of you as a burden. I'm your mother.
[21:47] A mother's heart is bound by her worries for her children.
[21:54] I cannot leave you in this society to fend for yourself.
[21:58] Don't worry, I'm very strong. I can compete with the whole world.
[22:06] No matter how strong a woman is.
[22:09] She is weaker than a man.
[22:15] I'm not scaring you.
[22:18] I'm trying to make you understand.
[22:21] We have to think over a lot of things.
[22:26] Falak is now married. I want you to get married too while I'm alive.
[23:51] How dare you touch her? If I see you near her ever again, I'll destroy you.
[24:01] Nawal I know I wronged you.
[24:04] Can it not be that we move forward like we were? Forgetting everything?
[24:14] Nawal a woman needs security and only a man can provide her that security.
[24:20] My life cannot be trusted. I might not be here to see tomorrow.
[24:24] That's why I want you to get married in my life Nawal.
[24:29] That's the only thing I want.
[24:36] No matter how strong a woman is, she's always weaken than a man.
[24:40] See Falak is now married.
[24:43] I want to see you married while I'm still alive.
[25:05] Who are you people? What are you doing in my house?
Are you Asjad?
[25:09] Yes I'm Asjad.
We have a warrant against you?
[25:12] Warrant? What Warrant?
[25:14] You harass woman on the road and now you're acting innocent about the warrant? Lets go.
[25:18] Let me talk to my lawyer.
[25:21] Lets go to the police station and then talk to your lawyer.
[25:24] Where are you taking him? Leave him. Leave him. Whats wrong?
[25:28] I don't understand anything
[25:50] Dear, I wanted you to stay here forever.
[25:55] To tell you the truth, I loved it here but its another thing that,
[26:02] sometimes some wishes just stay wishes.
[26:12] Alright, I'll leave now. Its time for my flight.
[26:18] Have a safe flight. Take care and keep calling me.
[26:22] Sure
Give my regards to everyone.
[26:26] Okay, travel safe
[28:13] Nawal? Nawal?
Yes?
[28:17] Nausheen called. She said Asjad was arrested.
[28:23] So what should we do if he's arrested? We're not related to them.
[28:26] And why did she call you?
[28:28] She wanted to ask if Nawal launched a police complaint.
[28:33] You don't have to answer her call.
[28:38] I told you earlier as well.
[28:40] We don't want to get involved with the police.
[28:42] I didn't file a complaint. Don't answer if she calls again.
[28:49] Okay.
Mom..
[28:55] Yes?
[29:01] Did Sofia aunty call?
[29:06] Don't worry.
[29:09] I know you don't want to marry Hamza. I'll tell her your answer when she calls.
[29:18] Do you think I should trust a person who broke my trust once?
[29:31] I'll just tell you to ask this question to yourself.
[29:36] Ask your heart, whether,
[29:40] it can forgive Hamza for this? Who does not make a mistake?
[29:46] But the position Hamza is at,
[29:49] he doesn't lack girls. Why is he hopeful for you? Hamza let his love down once.
[29:59] He's repenting now. Don't make the mistake he did.
[30:11] Think about it and make a decision.
[30:15] I'll support you in whatever decision you make.
[30:19] But I want you to think about it so that you don't have any guilt about anything.
[30:29] Nawal, I'll make up for all the pain I caused you.
[30:33] I'll love you so much that you'll forget everything.
[30:39] Alright.
[30:42] You can tell Sofia aunty that I have no objections against marrying Hamza.
[30:50] Nawal? My child. May you always be happy. I'm very happy for you.
[31:01] You've taken away all my worries. My heart is now free of all burdens. May you be happy always.
[31:21] Why are you crying now?
[31:34] Yes? Please check the inventory.
[31:44] Okay, thank you.
[31:47] Kabeer, who were you talking to?
[31:50] Nothing. I had a call from work. The inventory is here so they were informing.
[32:42] Hello mom. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
[32:48] I'm fine as well.
[32:49] I haven't talked to you since so many days. I thought I'd call and ask about you.
[32:55] You tell me, how are Kabeer and Aaliya treating you?
How would they be? They're the same.
[33:06] Leave me. It'll be the same. Tell me how is sister Nawal.
[33:11] Nawal is fine as well.
[33:13] We are considering the proposal that was here for her. We have to go to their house so,
[33:19] I was thinking if you could come with me. Its good if you could see your sister's in laws.
[33:27] You go ahead, is it important for me to go?
Of course it is. You're her sister.
[33:33] They're good people and I like them. Nawal also likes them. You should come along so that we can move things ahead.
[33:41] Alright. If you're insisting, I'll come but I don't have time.
I wanted Safdar and Fariha to be with me as well.
[33:52] But Fariha said she'll be here in a few days so we should look into matters until then.
[33:58] Alright mom. I'll come.
Alright. Bye.
[34:04] Bye.
[34:20] Come fast. We're getting late.
Mom. Stop.
[34:24] Who are they? What do they do? Where are we going? Why the suspense?
His name is Hamza Hashim. They're educated people.
[34:34] Hamza Hashim. Hashim Industry's owner?
Yes.
[34:40] His mother brought a proposal some time ago.
[34:47] Nawal is going to a very good house, like you. All by the grace of God.
[34:57] What are you thinking now? Come along. We're getting late.
[35:38] Hello.
Hello. How are you?
[35:41] I'm fine.
Did you find the house easily?
[35:44] Yes there was no problem.
[35:51] This is my younger daughter, Falak.
Alright.
[35:58] Hello aunty.
Hello dear. Come and sit. Please sit down.
[36:04] Sit dear.
Yes.
[36:09] Your daughter is very beautiful, she looks like a doll. Is she Kabeer's wife?
Yes.
[36:17] I haven't talked to Aaliya since a few days. She's a remarkable woman. I'm very inspired by her. She handles her business and the house so well.
[36:27] Amazing. Amazing. Its a very difficult thing to balance everything. You would know.
[36:37] Yes of course.
[36:42] Your house is beautiful. Everything seems branded as if its imported from abroad.
[36:47] Yes a lot of things are imported.
[36:51] I love the interior of your house.
[36:54] I'm sure, you must have done it.
[36:57] No I didn't do it myself dear but the idea and concept was mine.
[37:05] I'm impressed.
[37:06] In fact I love your house too dear. Aaliya has done it up so well.
[37:13] No. Its nothing compared to this house. I'll go and tell sister Aaliya,
[37:18] to get classes from you.
She talks lovely.
[37:23] Hamza is not to be seen?
[37:26] Yes he went to the office for a few meetings but I told him you were coming.
[37:31] Had I known you were bringing a good news, I'd have stopped him.
[37:36] You are absolutely right. We have no objection on the proposal. Congratulations.
[37:40] Thank you. I'm so happy. Hamza will be ecstatic. You honored me. This is such a good news.
[37:48] Now see, we'll not take time for any event. We'll get it done as soon as possible.
[37:54] As you say.
[37:57] Let Hamza come. I'll talk to him and we'll finalize everything.
[38:14] So dear, come along, I have a good news for you.
Really? What is it?
[38:21] Sultana came. They have agreed your proposal for Nawal.
[38:26] What? Are you telling the truth?
[38:30] Thank you so much. I'm so happy. I now have the biggest happiness in my life.
[38:38] Dear, I'm so happy for you. Your life will be stable now.
[38:45] I was worried when I saw you alone.
[38:48] Thank you so much. I love you.
[38:51] Its all because of you. Had you not been along. Your son, who has been successful in all walks of life,
[38:58] would have lost his love.
[39:01] You know, their childrens' happiness is the most precious thing for parents.
[39:10] You're my only son. I can do anything for your happiness.
[39:14] Thank you. I can see that.
[39:20] Thank you so much.
