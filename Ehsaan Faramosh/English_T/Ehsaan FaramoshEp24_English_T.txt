[01:49] What is it? You're out so late at night.
[01:54] Nothing brother. I felt suffocated in the room so I came outside.
[02:00] Did you talk to Falak?
[02:03] I did.
What did she say?
[02:14] She doesn't want to come back.
[02:18] She wants a divorce.
What?
[02:22] Kabeer you know what you're saying.
What can I say?
[02:30] Her demand is that either I shift with her in a new house or I should leave her.
[02:36] I had doubts this would happen.
[02:40] Aaliya's stupidity has ruined everything. I can't blame Falak.
[02:48] She's a human being. How much will she tolerate?
[02:52] I don't understand what should I do? I cannot decide.
[02:59] Kabeer you'll have to decide today or tomorrow.
[03:03] Things have gone worse and its useless to try Aaliya and Falak to understand. Its no use.
[03:12] Brother, whatever happens, I will not live separately from you.
What are you saying?
[03:21] You're my brother, my life. Nobody can separate us.
[03:28] Don't take out any such thing of your mouth, ever again. Alright?
[03:35] Thank you.
Everything will be alright. If God wills.
[03:41] Come on. Come along.
You go. I'm coming.
[04:01] See Aaliya I know you're unwell and upset but still.
[04:07] If not anyone, you should think about Kabeer.
[04:13] You said so many things to Falak in front of him.
[04:16] Its wrong.
I got angry.
[04:26] You don't realize but things have gone worse.
[04:30] Falak doesn't want to come to this house. She has given Kabeer two options.
[04:36] A separate house or a divorce?
What?
[04:42] Yes. See Kabeer loves Falak very much and I don't want,
[04:50] my younger brother to lose happiness for the rest of his life.
[04:55] The testing times he is facing right now, there's only one way out.
[05:02] You should go and bring Falak back to the house.
[05:09] See once Falak is back, everything will be alright. Trust me.
[05:23] At times some of our decisions create differences in relationships.
[05:28] This is why I'm here myself.
[05:31] I am embarrassed at the way I reacted. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened.
[05:42] You have realized your mistakes, its enough for us.
[05:47] Please call Falak and ask her to go home with me. Everybody is upset there.
[06:01] Why are you here?
[06:05] Who let her inside the house, mom?
[06:07] Falak, sit down and talk.
[06:10] You don't know what she did with me. She made me fall down in Kabeer's eyes.
[06:15] And she accused me of so many things.
[06:18] Tell mom and Nawal what you did to me. She acts good in front of you.
[06:25] Aaliya has realized her mistakes. She is here to apologize
[06:29] She is an egoistic woman. She won't apologize to anyone.
[06:33] Nawal and mom, I'm telling you she's planning something else to take me home.
[06:37] No Falak. I just want to take you home and live peacefully.
[06:44] Only fortunate people can live peacefully if you're around.
[06:47] Mom tell her to leave our house immediately.
[06:51] The pain I've borne because of her, I don't want my enemies to suffer like that too.
[06:56] Falak sit down and listen to her at least.
[06:59] I don't want to hear anyone out. She can never want good for me.
[07:03] Mom you don't have to listen to her.
[07:07] See, like I've forgotten everything and I'm here to take Falak home.
[07:12] Please I request the same from you people. Forget whatever happened in the past and move on.
[07:23] Until Kabeer gets a separate home, I'll not go back.
Alright.
[07:32] I wanted you to come back home.
[07:37] There's still time Falak.
[07:39] Care for Kabeer's love for you. Relationships are like old locks.
[07:46] If you don't open them for long, they'll catch rust.
[07:50] No keys then work. The only way out is to break them.
[07:55] Allow me to leave.
[08:00] Bye.
She is a liar.
[08:05] What is your problem, Falak?
[08:11] You people cannot force me.
[08:13] If you people think I'm a burden on you and you don't want me here, I'll leave from here as well.
[08:20] You have lost your mind, Falak. You speak what you want.
[08:23] Aaliya is the elder of that house. She came to apologize. What else do you want?
[08:28] People have to compromise to live a happy life.
[08:32] You have to deliberately act blind and deaf at times.
[08:38] You can do that.
[08:40] We're trying to make you understand something.
[08:42] Are you looking at her?
[08:45] This girl is always doing this. She doesn't understand. She always does as she pleases.
[08:52] Give me a day or two. I'll try to make her understand.
[08:56] Such small arguments happen in every home.
[09:01] We have to ignore to settle happily. She'll tell Kabeer everything and things will get worse.
[09:11] This girl never understands. What should I do about her? Nawal go and look at her.
Yes.
[09:26] I went to Falak's house to bring her back but she said no.
[09:35] Aaliya you should talk to Sultana aunty. She would have made her understand.
[09:41] She was there.
[09:44] She answered rudely in front of her.
[09:52] Toqueer see I went there because you said so and for Kabeer's happiness.
[09:59] But, Falak has decided that she'll live separately.
[10:07] You should talk to Kabeer. If he wants to shift as well, we're happy for him.
[11:41] I was thinking about you
[11:44] I spend every second painfully without you.
[11:48] I told you to come back but its your choice to go through this pain.
[11:53] Kabeer why don't you understand my feelings?
[11:57] I am asking for my right. I'm not asking for anything wrong. Tell me whats wrong about it?
[12:03] I don't understand why such a well educated man is thinking so much to take a decision.
[12:09] Because I'm not ungrateful Falak.
[12:14] And I've told you a thousand times. My life, my money, everything I have is because of Touqeer and Aaliya.
[12:23] If the two hadn't been in my life, I wouldn't have been where I am.
[12:27] Aaliya taught me how to walk. How can I be ungrateful?
[12:31] They didn't do you a favor.
[12:34] She has half the share in her business.
[12:36] She hasn't claimed a share in the business. Its all in my name. She is just a spoken partner.
[12:43] Her name is not there on the documents.
[12:46] She isn't greedy for all that and yet she helps me and supports me.
[12:54] That's why Falak, listen to me with open ears. Don't force me. I'll never shift to another house.
[13:03] Its up to you now. Tell me whatever you decide.
Kabeer...
[13:33] All my hard work, all my drama went to waste. I'll have to think something.
[13:38] I cannot let my hard work go waste.
[14:11] Dear, small arguments happen in homes.
[14:16] Learn to ignore everything. The beauty of relationships is in forgiveness.
[14:25] If something happens, we should just ignore.
[14:30] Okay?
Yes aunty.
[14:33] Take care.
Lets go Falak.
[14:37] Lets go.
Alright bye.
[14:39] Bye.
Bye mom.
[14:41] Take care.
[14:50] May God make my daughter happy.
[14:55] Lets go.
[15:14] I'm happy you're back. You decided well
[15:19] Everybody wanted me to come back.
[15:22] So I had to be back.
[15:36] But its only for a little while.
[15:40] What do you think? Will I do what everyone wants?
[15:46] Not at all. I'll do what I want. Whatever I've thought for myself.
[15:52] We should have a twist in the story. Don't worry. I'll add the twist.
[16:03] I promise you. You'll tell me yourself one day to live in a separate house.
[16:10] Live separately.
Oh Falak. When did you come?
[16:17] You did good.
[16:24] What is it? You're standing here. All good.
[16:30] Yes. Everything is alright.
[16:31] I was just telling Aaliya that if we have to live in the same house, why don't we,
[16:37] forget everything and live together.
[16:43] We should respect and love each other because we have to live together.
[16:47] You're right. A woman makes a house, home.
[16:55] And its a woman who can make a house, a hell.
[17:05] Oh well, its up to you two to decide,
[17:09] whether you two can live peacefully in this house together.
[17:14] Otherwise we do have an option of a separate house.
[17:16] No Touqeer what are you saying? We will not go anywhere. Kabeer and I will always be with you.
[17:28] Aaliya. Learn something from Falak.
[17:35] You're right. I have to learn a lot from Falak.
[17:48] I made the biggest mistake of my life bringing you in this house.
[17:54] If only I could rectify my mistake.
[17:58] Aaliya, why did you slap me? Should I tell everyone?
[18:04] That you slapped me?
[18:11] I see fear in your eyes clearly. Why do you talk so bitterly? Please don't.
[18:20] I don't tolerate such bitter things. Please relax, I'll not tell anyone.
[18:58] Did you talk to Falak?
[18:59] No I called but she didn't answer. Maybe she's busy.
[19:04] Call again. I don't know if someone talked again.
[19:11] I'll ask but I hope nobody would say anything or else she'd call again.
[19:17] That's true. I tell that girl to ignore things.
[19:24] It will make her life easy. But this girl never understands.
[19:30] Its alright. Don't worry. I'll make her understand.
Alright. Get me tea. Please.
[19:36] Alright, give me five minutes.
[20:16] Thank you.
[20:32] What is it? You're quiet.
[20:37] Nothing. Its just..
[20:43] Aaliya please don't say anything to Falak now.
[20:47] Things have settled down with a lot of difficulty so please.
[20:51] Do you think I'm so stupid? I'm sensible enough.
[20:57] You're very sensible but you get emotional at times.
[21:03] By the way, I'm happy that Falak decided to come back. Did you notice Kabeer?
[21:13] His face has its smile again. He's happy by the grace of God.
[21:21] He is happy.
[21:25] Aaliya, thanks. You made me proud.
[21:32] I can do whatever it takes for the happiness of my house. You don't have to thank me.
[21:48] I know it wouldn't have been easy for you to let go of your demand of a separate home.
[22:00] But still, you respected what I said. I'm happy for that.
[22:08] Thank you.
[22:10] How couldn't I? I love you.
[22:16] You know what? I was scared for a moment.
[22:22] I was thinking that if you became egoistic and stubborn, what would happen then?
[22:27] Ego and persistent is out of the question.
[22:30] I know you're helpless otherwise you'll never turn down what I ask for.
[22:40] I met Aaliya before I came upstairs. She,
[22:48] talks so politely. I didn't believe she's the same woman who,
[22:58] Kabeer I don't understand how she changes.
[23:06] She isn't feeling well. Maybe she reacts this way because of that. She has mood swings perhaps. By the way,
[23:14] if you say something to your angrily or if she scolds you, you should ignore. Don't answer back.
[23:23] I ignore such things she say. Always. And I'll keep doing that.
[23:28] We have to live together. We have to bear one another.
[23:33] So my wife is talking so sensibly now. I think she's sensible enough.
[23:41] Very good. I'm impressed.
[23:49] Did Aaliya create any trouble? Did she say anything?
[23:55] No. Nothing yet. It'll be peaceful for a few days.
[23:57] That's good. We're at least not worried about you now. Take care.
[24:03] And listen, if something happens, don't answer back. If you answer back, things could get worse.
[24:09] Why is everyone making me understand?
[24:12] As if I did everything. Nothing happened because of me earlier or now.
[24:17] Its Aaliya who wants to take Kabeer away from me.
[24:22] If it is so, don't give her a change.
[24:25] If she has a positive behavior with you, you keep your behavior positive too.
[24:29] Kabeer promised he'd take care of you.
[24:32] Yes. Everything sounds good from afar
[24:35] Had my husband been good, things wouldn't have come to this point.
[24:39] I kept banging my head. I always think what type of husbands listen to their wives.
[24:45] I was so happy before I got married that I didn't have a mother in law.
[24:50] But now I have one sister in law Aaliya, who is equal to ten mother in laws.
[24:53] Oh God.. Where am I trapped?
[24:57] Falak, don't be so ungrateful.
[25:00] Expect good from God. People change in no time but we need to try ourselves too.
[25:07] You should act with love and graciousness and everybody will love you.
[25:13] Whether Kabeer or Aaliya.
I cannot flatter anyone.
[25:18] I cannot be like you. I'll only respect someone who respects me. Its straight.
[25:24] Falak, why do you see everything with your angle? Why can't you listen to me for once?
[25:31] Alright. I'll listen to you.
Good girl.
[25:36] Tell hello to mom from me. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
[25:50] Its the question of my son's life. Please understand.
What is all this noise?
[25:55] Stay here, I'll go and ask. Wait here.
[25:59] I need to discuss something very important. Its about my son's life.
[26:03] What are you doing here?
[26:08] Nawal dear. I want to talk to you. Listen to me for two minutes.
[26:12] Nawal mam, I tried to stop her but she barged inside.
I'll leave.
[26:18] Let me talk once.
What it is? Tell me.
[26:22] Dear, I beg of you. Please forgive me.
[26:28] What are you doing?
Forgive me dear.
[26:31] Please get my son out of jail. The police isn't letting him go.
[26:35] God knows what cases he's being charged with. I tried but he isn't getting out.
[26:42] Please get him out.
I didn't get your son arrested.
[26:46] I know but you can get him out.
[26:48] I'm worried dear. Since Asjad has gone to jail, we've been ridiculed.
[26:55] I cannot do anything.
[26:56] Dear, don't be so cold hearted. I tried for a bail but we're not getting one.
[27:03] I agree we wronged you, dear. But see,
[27:09] we have been punished.
Alright. Fine. I,
[27:17] will try. I cannot promise but I'll do what I can.
[27:22] May God keep you happy, dear.
[27:33] Lock the door.
[27:43] Keep it there.
[27:50] Falak, now that you're back. Get back with your responsibilities.
[27:55] Please see that the food is ready on time. Everybody eats at home.
[28:01] Why are you asking me? Tell the servants.
[28:04] Touqeer gave you the responsibility of the house so I'll ask you.
[28:08] And you'll be deciding the menu. The servants won't cook.
[28:14] I'm not a servant here.
[28:16] People will do what they want to do.
[28:19] When did I say you were a servant?
[28:23] I can understand the taunt in your tone.
[28:27] Tell me openly whatever you want to say. I want to know whats going on in your brain.
[28:33] Why do you misunderstand everything?
[28:36] When you have the responsibility to run the house, do it. You made tall claims then.
[28:43] Now since you have the house, do the chores.
You cannot order me around.
[28:50] I'm asking you lovingly, not ordering you around.
[28:55] Let Kabeer come. I'll tell him how you're treating me.
[28:59] What did I tell you? You only know how to spread chaos and nothing else.
[29:05] Do you have any proofs?
[29:08] You should understand that if Kabeer wanted to live separately he would have done so when you asked for it.
[29:15] But he wants to live with us and you'll be living here too.
[29:20] Live peacefully and let us live peacefully too. I'll be back in a while.
[29:51] Asjad's mom came to our house. She said the police wasn't letting Asjad go.
[29:56] Its good. He should stay inside. He deserves it.
[30:01] She was crying. She begged me. I was sad.
Why were you sad?
[30:09] What they did to you, you should be happy.
[30:13] He could do the same thing with someone else, after you.
[30:16] But I have forgiven him Hamza.
Your silence turned Asjad into a lion.
[30:23] Had you gotten him arrested before, he would have sense knocked into him.
[30:28] I felt embarrassed when I looked at the hung shoulders of Mrs. Nausheen. I think they have learned their lesson.
[30:35] Talk to someone and get Asjad out.
Are you sure?
[30:41] Alright. I'll get him out. I think he should have been in jail for at least six months.
[30:56] Oh wow. I smell something wonderful today.
[31:02] How are you, little one? Falak where are you going? Have dinner
[31:07] .
No Kabeer I'm not hungry.
[31:09] Why Falak?
[31:11] What happened?
Nothing happened. Please eat. Its nothing.
[31:16] What happened? Tell me.
Even if I tell you, what would happen. Its nothing.
[31:24] Did you say anything?
I didn't say anything. I just came back in front of you.
[31:29] Falak, see if there's nothing, why are you worrying us all? Come and eat.
Kabeer I told you.
[31:38] Aaliya doesn't want to see me in this house.
[31:41] She cannot tolerate me in front of her. Why did you bring me back?
[31:46] Falak I didn't lie to you.
[31:49] Aaliya went to bring you back yourself.
[31:51] And if someone wants to bring you back themselves, why would they say anything?
[31:59] Ask her. She misbehaved with me today. She called me a servant.
[32:04] She said Toqueer gave you this responsibility because I'm the servant of the house.
[32:13] Falak, I didn't say anything to you.
[32:18] How can you lie? 
[32:21] Ever since you gave me the responsibility of the house, she's always taunting me. 
[32:27] I don't want anything. Give her back the responsibility.
[32:31] I'm sorry but enough is enough. Falak is lying one after another thing. 
[32:36] Why do you want to create differences in the house?
Aaliya..
[32:39] Relax please. Calm down. Falak, Aaliya cannot say this.
[32:46] I believe you made a mistake in hearing this. I know her very well.
[32:54] She never talked to our servants like this. How would she say such a thing to you?
[33:01] You think I'm lying? Don't you trust me?
[33:05] Kabeer God bears my witness. I only asked Falak to get the dinner going on early today.
[33:10] Everybody eats at home. 
[33:12] The servants don't cook themselves, you have to tell them the menu. I don't know what she heard or understood.
[33:20] Yes mommy's right. Mom didn't say such a thing. She isn't lying.
[33:42] See Falak, you are holding misunderstandings in your heart without a reason. 
[33:47] I believe you misunderstood what you heard.
[33:52] You're right. I might have made a mistake. I'm sorry.
Its okay.
[34:00] Now go freshen up. Your eyes are red with all the crying. Come. We'll eat.
[34:08] Please sit down.
[34:10] Had Hafsa not been here, you wouldn't have believed me.
[34:16] Its not that. We cannot judge the truth from someone's tone. 
[34:20] Alright now, everyone sit and eat.
[34:41] I'm sorry but enough is enough. Falak is lying one after another. 
[34:47] Why do you want to create differences in the house?
[34:49] Yes mommy's right. Mom didn't say anything. She isn't lying.
[35:05] Its sad Falak.
[35:07]  Everybody made you understand and yet you created a drama as soon as you're back. 
[35:13] Stop it now.
[35:15] Lies and dramas are not always successful. Sometimes you fall on your face.
[35:23] Wins and losses are part of a game. 
[35:26] I might have lost this time but I won't lose the next game.
[35:33] Its your luck that I lost.
[35:37] You're here and so am I. We'll see who wins.
[35:45] No matter how much you plan. Remember that truth prevails and lies are unmasked one day.
[35:54] You still have time Falak, change yourself. 
[35:56] Drop your planning and cheap plotting. Kabeer loves you. If not anything, care for his love for you.
[36:05] You worry too much about Kabeer.
[36:09] I will make you cry so much that you'll beg me to leave this house.
[36:16] You should go. But you want to take Kabeer along,
[36:20] you can take him along. I have no objections.
[36:24] But now I don't want to go anywhere.
[36:28] Now I want you to leave this house. Kabeer and I will live here.
[36:32] Because officially, Kabeer owns all the business, this house and everything. 
[36:36] You're just stuck to my husband without a reason.
[36:41] Mind your tongue.
[36:44] I'll stage doom's day for you and you will be buried in the ground along with this house.
[36:51] All your pride and ego will be buried.
[36:57] I can pull out the ground from beneath your feet whenever I want. Remember this.
[37:08] I am telling you to just wait for that time.
[37:47] There are wins and losses in a game. 
[37:51] What if I lost this game, I might not lose the next one.
[37:57] Its your luck that I lost.
[38:02] I'll make you cry so much that you'll beg me to leave this house but now I don't want to leave this house now. You should go.
[38:13] All this business and this house is Kabeer's. You own nothing. 
[38:18] You're just stuck to my husband without a reason.
[38:23] I'll stage a doom's day for you and bury you in the ground with this house.
[38:29] I can pull the ground beneath your feet, whenever I want. Remember this.
