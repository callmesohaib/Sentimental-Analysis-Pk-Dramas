[00:12] You left her here yourself and you said that you don't have any connection with Elham.
[00:18] You gave me legal document about that.
[00:20] My house is ruined by none other than my own sister.
[00:25] I am going through so much pain.
[00:27] Now I am hundred percent sure that sister Nawal must have provoked Kabir against me.
[00:33] You shouldn't compromise on your self respect.
[00:37] How did he call you a cheater.
[00:39] Kabir, is she your ex-wife Falak? Right?
[00:59] You don't have to worry. Just wait a bit.
[01:04] Let me arrange a nice flat for you so that you can shift there.
[01:08] What difference will that make?
[01:11] Will that erase my pain?
[01:15] I have endured more pain because of trusting someone than you.
[01:22] Both of us are on same page in this matter.
[01:25] We have been effected by one person.
[01:30] Yes you are right.
[01:33] Our fates are alike.
[01:36] And also our destinies are connected as well.
[01:40] We have been deceived by those people whom we loved most.
[02:18] Falak, tell me the truth whether you called Hamza or not?
[02:21] What happened to you sister? I already told you that I was in lawn with Elham. You can ask from maid about that.
[02:51] Greetings Kabir.
Greetings. How are you?
[02:56] I am fine. How are you and how is Elham?
[03:01] She is also fine. Nawal, I want to discuss something with you.
[03:06] Yes what's up?
[03:08] I have seen Hamza and Falak together in restaurant today.
[03:13] Nawal, no matter whether you believe me or not but after seeing both of them together today,
[03:19] I am certain that Falak called Hamza that night. No one can do that except her.
[03:27] OK, I admit that Falak called him
[03:31] but what will she get by doing so?
[03:34] What will she get by misguiding Hamza about me?
[03:37] I don't know.
[03:39] But I know for sure that whatever is happening, Falak is behind that.
[03:59] Hey mom, don't worry. Just do what I am asking you to do.
[04:04] God willing everything will be alright.
[04:09] But Hamza is not ready to get convinced. He doesn't want to take Nawal's name.
[04:13] He will be convinced mom. I will talk to him tomorrow.
[04:17] The misunderstandings between Hamza and Nawal will only remove when they will meet one on one.
[04:26] Did you talk to Nawal?
[04:28] No, at first I thought to call her
[04:32] but then I didn't call her. I think I should talk to Hamza first and convince him first.
[04:39] Nawal will be convinced. She only has problem with Hamza's behavior.
[04:44] But if they meet one on one with each other then everything will be alright. Trust me.
[04:50] If you succeed in your effort then that will be great. God willing mom.
[04:57] Do you know my child, if both of them get convince once then we wont delay at all.
[05:02] Not at all mom. I am so excited.
[05:21] Sister, didn't you go to sleep yet?
[05:24] I was unable to sleep.
Why? Are you feeling alright?
[05:28] I am fine but I think you are not feeling well.
[05:32] Have you seen the time? From where are you coming at this time?
[05:36] I got late in office.
[05:39] I tried so much to leave early but I got late. You know about office matters.
[05:48] You are doing job? But you didn't tell me about that?
[05:53] I already told you that I have started job in Hamza's office.
[05:56] O God Hamza has given me so many responsibilities as soon as I joined the office.
[06:01] Falak, have you joined Hamza's office?
[06:07] I already told you about that.
When? When did you tell me?
[06:13] Really? Didn't I tell you?
[06:18] I must forgot that.
[06:20] Anyways, Hamza offered me the job so I accepted his offer.
[06:24] I thought what's the use of sitting at home idly, so I should do a job
[06:27] Falak how can you join Hamza's office despite you know that my engagement with Hamza has been broken?
[06:32] Yes, I know but what is the connection of my job with your break up?
[06:37] It is connected for sure. Why not!
[06:39] Hamza has put such lowly and false accusations on me Falak.
[06:43] Despite that are you really doing job in his office who has raised questions on your sister's character?
[06:52] Sister, please don't involve me in your personal matters.
[06:56] I have already been involved so much.
[06:58] I tried to make you understand that don't do job in Kabir's office and stay away from him
[07:05] but you didn't listen to me because you didn't want to listen.
[07:08] What are you talking about Falak?
[07:10] I am right sister, if you can work in Kabir's company then why can't I work in Hamza's company?
[07:17] Kabir is my ex-husband and Hamza is your ex-fiance, so the matter is same on both sides.
[07:22] And by the way, if I am doing job in Hamza's company after your breakup then you shouldn't get bothered because of that.
[07:31] I was so tired and you started this argument. Let me get fresh.
[08:00] Greetings.
[08:03] Where is fresh juice which I asked you to make?
[08:06] Let me bring that.
[08:07] And did you buy bran bread?
[08:10] I forgot that. I will buy that today.
[08:12] You don't do anything properly.
[08:14] Now check if there is someone outside so ask him to bring that and also boil eggs for me.
[08:19] OK, let me bring that.
[08:24] Wow, your way of life has changed altogether.
[08:29] Are you feeling happy about it?
[08:31] I am seeing everything and understanding as well.
[08:37] You are going to office in this getup?
[08:41] Yes
[08:42] Do you think that whatever you are doing is right?
[08:47] What have I done?
[08:49] For whom you are dressed up and going to office like this?
[08:53] What do you want to say?
You know it very well that what I want to say.
[08:59] It's none of your business that for whom I am dressed up and you shouldn't get worried about me.
[09:07] Stay away from me.
[09:39] I have brought Falak here. She wanted to meet Elham.
[09:42] It's fine. Then go and bring her. Go.
[09:49] Falak is not in lawn
[09:51] You would found her if she was here Nawal.
[09:55] Aunt Sophia will come in a day or two to force you to get convince to get married.
[10:02] No matter how much she forces you, don't get convinced.
[10:08] It's none of your business that for whom I am dressed up and you shouldn't get worried about me.
[10:14] Stay away from me.
[10:29] Hello Nawal, how are you?
[10:31] I am fine. How are you?
[10:34] I am find as well. Aren't you committed somewhere else in the afternoon today?
[10:38] No I am not. Do you want something from me?
[10:41] No but I was planning a lunch and I will be delighted if you will attend that.
[10:48] Sister, it's difficult.
[10:53] Please don't mind but I wont be able to come.
[11:00] Listen Nawal, I know that you are hurt because of Hamza's behavior.
[11:04] Me and mom are also very worried and there is a lot of tension going on in our house.
[11:08] I want to talk to you about that matter.
[11:13] I want to end this tension and may everything be alright.
[11:17] Sister, everything has been finished.
[11:21] There is nothing left to be discussed or getting fixed.
[11:26] Please don't call me.
[11:28] Nawal please, I am your elder sister. Wont you listen to me?
[11:41] OK fine, if you are insisting then I will come.
[11:46] Thank you Nawal.
[11:48] I was sure that you wont avoid me. See you at lunch.
[11:53] Good bye.
[12:09] I didn't have any idea that she hates you that much.
[12:12] As soon as she knew that I have got job in your office,
[12:15] she asked me to resign from this job.
[12:18] She blackmailed me emotionally and taunted me so much.
[12:21] She said that she will never see my face ever again. She wants me to resign from this job.
[12:26] Listen to me Falak, don't take any kind of pressure. I am with you. Right?
[12:34] What do I do Hamza?
[12:36] She owns that house and she knows very well that I don't have money so where will I go and what will I do?
[12:41] She wants me to go away from you in any case.
[12:49] She doesn't want to see your face. She hates you so much.
[12:54] I don't care about her as well.
[12:56] I hate her so much that I don't want to even listen her name.
[12:59] What happened Hamza?
Why are you getting worried?
[13:06] Please leave all this. I don't know why we are taking so much stress of their words?
[13:12] We need some time. Let's have lunch at some good restaurant.
[13:23] Just a second. Sister is calling me.
[13:28] Hello.
Where are you?
[13:31] I am in office, where can I be at this time sister?
[13:33] Come to home immediately. I have some important work.
[13:37] But I can't come right now. I have to do work in office.
[13:41] No, come home immediately. I have to go somewhere with you for a very important work.
[13:46] OK, I am coming.
[13:47] Right.
[13:53] Sorry Falak, we can't go out for lunch.
[13:55] Actually, sister has to discuss something important with me.
[13:59] No problem.
[14:01] I will have to go.
[14:04] You don't worry. Bye.
[14:38] Hamza.
[14:39] Yes sister, why have you asked me to come?
[14:41] Let's go with me to meet Nawal.
[14:44] Listen Hamza, I want you and Nawal to sit together and remove all misunderstandings between you.
[14:50] Who has told you that I have any misunderstanding?
[14:52] And you shouldn't have called me like this.
[14:54] I was in an important meeting and if you told me earlier then I would never come here.
[14:58] You don't have any misunderstanding?
[15:02] Let me talk to her.
[15:05] Take the phone and talk to her.
[15:08] I don't want to talk to her.
[15:11] I hate her and I don't want to see her face as well.
[15:17] Take it.
Hamza.
[15:46] I don't want to talk to her.
[15:49] I hate her and I don't want to see her face as well.
[16:13] I invited Nawal with so much love and she came here on my invitation.
[16:17] I don't believe that Hamza behaved so rudely.
[16:21] He has lost his mind nothing else.
[16:24] I am feeling so embarrassed.
[16:28] Hamza has no idea right now that he is making a big mistake by doing this to Nawal.
[16:34] He wont be able to find a girl like Nawal again mom.
[16:37] This boy is getting out of control day by day.
[16:40] I don't know what is he thinking?
[16:42] We arranged his engagement because of his stubbornness. Nawal was not convinced.
[16:47] We have fixed their marriage with great difficulty
[16:49] and that decision was made among the elders of both families.
[16:53] Now he wants to break this relation. Not at all.
[16:58] I can't do this injustice to that girl. I promised to Sultana that I wont leave Nawal alone.
[17:05] No, no, no, I can't do this cruelty. I will definitely get this marriage done.
[17:10] I am going to talk to her today. I wont leave Nawal alone.
[17:14] She is a very nice girl.
[17:17] I told you that your family wont believe you.
[17:22] No one can believe after seeing sister Nawal because she pretends to be so pious.
[17:29] Only both of us know about her reality.
[17:33] And she is so clever.
[17:35] As soon as she realized that you are getting out of her hands then she got aunt and sister's sympathies.
[17:40] She must have been inciting them.
[17:41] That's why they are against you and don't want to listen to you.
[17:46] You are right.
[17:49] Mom and sister don't believe me. They think that I am wrong.
[17:55] They wont let you marry to someone else so it would be better to agree with them.
[18:02] Not at all. I wont marry Nawal.
[18:08] Let me tell you one thing Hamza, you deserve a girl who understands you
[18:14] and stays with you and understands you.
[18:32] Hello.
[18:33] Hamza I have told everything about the mess you have created today.
[18:37] And she is very angry right now and she is going to fix the date of your marriage right now.
[18:42] So stop her. Ask her that we will discuss in the evening when I will come home.
[18:48] Why do I stop her?
[18:50] Someone has to rectify your wrong doings. Right?
[18:53] Listen to me.
[19:03] No one cares about you. They don't want to listen to you.
[19:08] In my opinion you should agree with them, just sake of peace of your mind.
[19:30] Let's go Falak.
[19:33] Where?
[19:35] I will tell you. Let's go.
[19:41] In my opinion a person should marry to someone whom with he has understanding.
[19:47] So do you think that you have understanding with Falak?
[19:50] With whom you have come?
[19:53] Are you spying on me?
[20:06] Where is he? He knows that we are getting late.
[20:10] I don't know mom.
[20:13] She?
[20:35] Greetings aunt.
[20:37] Falak? What is she doing here?
[20:42] I have brought her here.
[20:47] OK, let's go.
[20:54] I am not going with you.
[21:00] Listen Hamza, still nothing has spoiled.
[21:05] Everything can be fixed if you show some flexibility then me and mom will talk to Nawal and will convince her.
[21:12] I am unable to understand that
[21:14] why do you force me for same thing again and again?
[21:18] I told you that I wont marry to Nawal that's it.
[21:23] If you don't want to marry Nawal then with whom will you get married?
[21:34] with Falak.
[21:52] I want to get married to Falak.
[21:54] What are you talking about Hamza? Haven't you lost your mind?
[21:59] I am absolutely right.
Why have you made this decision?
[22:03] I have made this decision very thoughtfully.
[22:06] Me and Nawal have no understanding at all.
[22:09] I think something else and she thinks something else.
[22:12] So in my opinion a person should get married to someone with whom he has understanding.
[22:17] Do you think that there is understanding between you and Falak?
[22:21] Yes, off course, I think that way.
[22:26] I know Falak very well and she knows me as well.
[22:30] In fact she understands me very well so what else I need.
[22:38] That's why I have decided that
[22:44] Falak is the best choice for my life partner.
[22:48] Whatever you decide but I don't accept this proposal.
[22:52] Drop her at her house immediately.
[22:54] Why?
[22:56] What's wrong with her?
[22:58] What's wrong with her? You are asking me? Don't you know about that?
[23:02] What did she do with Kabir and his family, don't you know about that?
[23:06] She has humiliated that family by doing press conferences everywhere.
[23:10] And what has she done with Aliya? Poor Aliya.
[23:13] She has falsely accused her so much that she has fallen ill.
[23:21] And the most important thing is that Hamza that you are my only son and a bachelor as well.
[23:27] And you want me to accept that you are going to marry a divorced woman.
[23:36] Impossible. This is not possible. I will never accept it.
[23:40] But mom, all of that is a lie.
[23:43] She didn't do injustice to anyone.
[23:46] Rather she has faced the cruelty and injustice.
[23:49] Why do you believe on sister Aliya's words?
[23:53] You should sympathize with her but you are accusing her.
[23:58] Because it's her fault.
[24:00] But you can't see that. I know Aliya very well. She can't be cruel to anyone. 
[24:06] What are you talking about?
[24:08] This girl is lying to you.
[24:41] You will get married to Nawal and this is my final decision. That's it.
[24:44] So listen to my final decision as well.
[24:47] I wont marry Nawal. 
[24:49] If I will get married to someone then it will be only Falak.
[24:59] Hamza, Hamza listen to me.
[25:07] Falak, I am sorry for whatever mom has said.
[25:11] Will my humiliation get removed from your apology?
[25:14] I swear that I didn't have any idea that mom will behave like this.
[25:18] I am really very embarrassed.
[25:20] You don't have any idea Hamza that how much I am hurt because of aunt's words.
[25:25] I feel as if someone has cut me into pieces.
[25:30] I said, I am sorry. Please.
[25:33] She was so angry that's why she said that otherwise she wouldn't have said that.
[25:36] Yes, I know that.
[25:38] You have brought me to a diversion. I am unable to understand anything Hamza.
[25:43] You made such a big decision alone. You didn't even ask me once.
[25:48] And I didn't even know that what is going on in your mind and heart.
[25:54] You are right.
[25:56] I made a very big mistake.
[25:59] I should have asked you before talking to mom.
[26:06] Anyways.
[26:08] So tell me now.
[26:11] Will you marry me?
[26:23] Hamza, I can't make any decision instantly.
[26:28] And whatever has just happened after that not at all.
[26:32] I need some time. I want to think about this.
[26:37] OK.
[26:39] Think about it.
[26:42] You have the complete authority to accept or reject.
[26:47] I will accept whatever you will decide.
[26:57] Let me drop you at your home.
[27:10] Doctor, what has happened to mom suddenly? Isn't there anything to worry?
[27:16] There is nothing to worry at all but her blood pressure is excessively on higher side.
[27:21] I have injected her and she will get normal in a while but keep one thing in mind.
[27:27] There should be no spices in her diet.
[27:30] And please try not to discuss any thing in front of her which give her tension.
[27:34] Yes I understand.
[27:42] Please bring these medicines.
[27:44] Give her these medicines for one week. She will recover God willing.
[27:48] I will bring these medicines. Thank you so much.
[27:56] Mom. Mom.
[28:00] How can my son make such a big decision without my permission?
[28:05] Mom why are you so worried?
[28:08] He has only made the decision. His decision can be changed. Right?
[28:14] And anyways he has no emotional attachment with Falak.
[28:19] This is his temporary and emotional decision and he is only doing this because of Nawal's opposition.
[28:25] When both of us will make him understand then he will be convinced. Right?
[28:32] And you will see that he will admit that he was wrong.
[28:37] I want to talk to him. Call him and let me talk to him.
[28:42] I called him, he is out somewhere.
[28:45] He will come shortly. Please take rest. 
[28:48] Mom please don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[29:05] Thanks for dropping me at home.
[29:08] Falak.
[29:12] Whatever decision you take. Keep one thing in your mind
[29:18]  that I want to marry you with the bottom of my heart.
[29:20] You said it so easily that you want to marry me with the bottom of your heart.
[29:26] I will have to think about it. After all sister Nawal is my sister.
[29:38] I don't know what will be her reaction. 
[29:42] But I know that whatever her reaction will be that will be a very severe reaction.
[29:48]  but you say that we shouldn't take care of those who don't care about us.
[30:06] And both your mother and sister don't want us to get married.
[30:16] I will convince them. Don't worry about them.
[30:29] Good bye.
[30:51] With whom have you come?
[30:55] Are you spying on me?
[31:01] Listen sister, I told you in the morning and I am telling you again 
[31:04] that don't interfere in my personal matters.
[31:07] And mind your own business.
 Urooj bring coffee for me.
[31:23] Hamza.
[31:27] Where were you?
[31:29] Do you have any idea that mom's health was deteriorated so much?
[31:32] What?
[31:34] So why didn't you tell me? You should have called me.
[31:36] Check your mobile, I called you so many times but neither you received my call nor called me back.
[31:45] Sorry, I couldn't check my phone.
[31:50] How is she feeling now?
[31:51] She is in her room. She is feeling better now and sleeping at the moment.
[31:57] Hamza, what happened to you? What's wrong with you?
[32:03] The tone in which you were talking today, 
[32:06] you misbehaved so much with mom because of that girl Falak. I don't believe it. What are you thinking?
[32:14] Please make mom understand to agree with me.
[32:17] Why don't you understand Hamza? Falak is not a good girl.
[32:22] Whatever we have heard about her in our society those can't be wrong.
[32:27] That must be true. 
[32:29] The way Falak took divorce, she left her daughter. She is her mother.
[32:35] How can she be sincere with you if she is not sincere with her daughter?
[32:41] You as well. You believe on these false stories as well. 
[32:45] What do you think that I am a fool? I can't see anything.
[32:49] Anger makes man blind.
[32:52] He can't differentiate between right and wrong. 
[32:55] Nawal is a million times better than Falak.
[32:58] She takes care of everyone and she loves everyone.
[33:01] Nawal has cheated on me.
[33:03] She was having an affair with Kabir behind my back.
This is a lie.
[33:07] I know very well that Nawal is not that type of girl.
[33:10] And whoever has put this in your mind, he/she wants to create misunderstandings between you and Nawal.
[33:16] I have seen with my own eyes.
[33:19] And that can't be false.
It can be.
[33:23] If you are blind folded with misunderstandings then you will consider everything false thing right.
[33:28] Now this argument is not useful.
[33:30] I have decided. 
[33:34] Nothing can happen now
[33:52] If you don't want to marry to Nawal then with whom you want to get married?
[33:56] with Falak.
[33:58] I have made this decision very thoughtfully. 
[34:00] There is no understanding between me and Nawal. I think something else and she think something else.
[34:06] And a person should marry someone with whom he has understanding.
[34:14] I should have asked you before talking to mom. So tell me now.
[34:20] Will you marry me?
[34:25] Finally, that is going to happen what I wanted.
[34:30] I am about to get the biggest happiness of my life. Hamza.
[34:35] He will become mine.
[34:46] Whatever decision you make, keep one thing in your mind.
[34:51] That I want to marry you with bottom of my heart.
[35:01] Do you want me to accept that you are going to marry a divorced woman. 
[35:07] Impossible. This is not possible.
[35:14] I will take revenge of each and everything. I will not forget.
[35:18] Let me marry to Hamza then you will see what will I do to you.
[35:43] Elham.
[35:47] What happened Elham? Didn't you get hurt? My baby.
[35:55]  Noor.
[36:00] Noor.
[36:04] Where did you go after leaving her?
[36:06] I went to make her feeder.
[36:08] There was no need to leave her alone. She fell down.
[36:13] I didn't have idea that baby will fall down otherwise I wouldn't go.
[36:19] Give me.
[36:23] Drink milk. Drink milk.
[36:27] Don't leave her alone in room ever again otherwise I will treat very badly.
[36:32] Yes, I will take care of that.
[36:33] You should do that because it's your duty.
[36:38] And if you are unable to do your job then tell me so that I will hire someone else.
[36:41] Don't worry, I will be careful next time.
[36:46] Prepare her baby bag.
[36:48] From now on I will take her to office with me.
[36:51] I wont get worried if she will be in front of me.
[36:54] OK, let me do that.
[37:01] Will you help dad in his office work? Hmm?
[37:04] Will you help me in office or bother me by crying?
[37:08] Thank you my child.
[37:22] How are you feeling now?
[37:24] Nazish, tell your brother that I don't want to talk to him so go from here.
[37:40] Mom please, why are you so stubborn? Don't you want to see me happy?
[37:48] I am not stubborn rather you are showing stubbornness. 
[37:51] Which mother don't like her son's happiness?
[37:55] I want to see you happy that's why I am telling you that Nawal is a very good girl.
[38:00] So you think that my happiness is to get married to Falak.
[38:09] Will you marry to such a girl. 
[38:12] What has she done to her own sister?
[38:17] Such girl can't be loyal to anyone.
[38:28] They brought her up, fed her well and gave her everything.
[38:38] But she did this in response to their kindness and good deeds?
[38:51] Such an oblivious girl can never become my daughter-in-law.
