[01:54] I wasn't expecting you to come.
[01:56] How could I not come? I promised you. I had to come.
[01:59] Thank you. You're here all alone?
[02:02] I'm still single, sister in law.
[02:05] I didn't mean that. Where is Sofia aunty and Nazish? I requested them to be here specially.
[02:11] They really wanted to come but Nazish's daughter felt unwell all of the sudden to they had to leave for Canada.
[02:20] Oh. I'll call and ask here. Oh Falak. Come meet her.
Hello.
[02:27] Hello.
[02:31] This is a small gift for you.
Thank you.
[02:35] By the way, this is Nawal. Falak's elder sister.
[02:47] And this is a Hamza. Owner of Hamza Industries and Real Estate.
[02:51] He's also our business partner in our new venture.
[02:56] I know her. She works in my office. We have interacted a lot.
[03:10] You didn't give any reaction.
[03:16] Mam, one picture please.
Yes sure. Come along. Hamza come on.
[03:29] Please send me these pictures as well, sister in law. I am really enjoying a wedding after such a long time.
Sure.
[03:38] Thank you.
I'll just go see mom.
[03:39] Sure.
[03:50] Do you need anything else?
No. Thank you dear.
[03:55] If you could ask me if I needed something, I'd really like it.
[04:00] There are so many people who could ask you.
[04:02] I don't think me asking you will make any difference to you.
[04:04] Why won't it? You're the host and I'm the guest.
[04:09] Do you want anything?
[04:11] Yes. You as my partner.
[04:17] Listen to me.
[04:22] You look really beautiful today. I had always wanted to see you like this.
[04:28] You've never dolled up, ever.
[04:32] Maybe once in our university function. How many years has it been?
[04:36] Hamza stop it. You don't have to pretend anything.
[04:40] I'm not pretending. This is my love for you.
[04:44] Hamza please stop it. Everybody in the office knows already, now do you want everybody here to know as well?
[04:49] Why are you always so upset with me?
You know the reason to this, very well.
[05:14] Come along. Be careful.
Alright...
[05:18] Wait a second. Nasreen..
[05:25] Come. Now recite God's name before you enter the house. Alright. Be careful.
[05:33] May God bless your presence in this house.
Amen.
[05:37] Where is the photographer? Click our family picture now. Hurry up.
[05:46] Congratulations everybody. Especially my brother. May God bless you with all the happiness.
[05:54] Thank you. And you sister in law, thank you so much.
[06:00] You have played the most important part in making my ordinary life, special.
[06:04] And for making this house, a home.
[06:07] Now lets take Falak to our home. Come along.
[06:14] My wife has completed one of her duties today. She has completed this family.
[06:21] Aaliya, today, thank you so much.
[06:25] What is this? Thank God that our Kabeer has all the happiness in the world.
[06:31] Had uncle and aunty been alive today, they would have been very happy.
[06:36] Aaliya you've shown everyone that relationships aren't only made by blood, but the more stronger ones are made with care and consideration.
[06:44] This is my house. Our happiness, sadness, everything is one. Falak,
[06:50] when I got married and came here, my mother in law gave me these bangles.
[06:58] Today I'm giving them to you.
[07:12] Thank you.
[07:13] May you be happy forever. May God bless you with all the happiness there is.
[07:18] Kabeer, now since you have such a beautiful wife, don't forget your sister in law.
[07:24] Oh no, sister in law. What are you saying?
I'm just teasing you.
[07:30] Now will you guys keep talking or get some sweets for the bride.
[07:35] Nasreen hurry up and get some sweets.
[08:17] I had always wanted to see you all dolled up like this. You've never gotten ready like this.
[10:19] Mom, give me some too..
Oh..
[10:25] What did you do?
Dear, what did you do?
[10:28] She destroyed my bridal dress, Kabeer.
[10:31] Falak I'm sorry. She didn't do it deliberately. She's a kid, she made a mistake. Don't worry.
[10:35] Naseer go and get something to clean it up.
Let it be. Whats done is done.
[10:46] See, I realize, what is going on in your heart.
[10:50] This is your bridal dress and every girl has emotional attachment with her bridal dress, I know.
[10:56] Its alright Falak. Its okay. She made a mistake.
[10:59] Dear, go and play with your cousins. What are you doing with all the elders?
[11:03] I don't want to go. I want mama to give me the sweets.
Hafsa dear, you should listen to me sometimes.
[11:07] Kabeer take me to my room.
Alright come. Hafsa dear, give your aunt some space.
[11:14] Go Kabeer.
[11:30] Whats wrong Falak? Your mood is still off?
[11:36] Today is the beginning of our new life. Will you start it like this?
[11:45] Didn't you see what happened? Everything happened in front of you. Why are you asking me?
[11:51] This is the first I've seen a bride getting such a welcome.
[11:55] Falak whatever happened, nobody knew it would happen.
[12:01] And Hafsa? She is a small child. She didn't spill the dessert on your dress deliberately.
[12:09] Kabeer you have no idea what my emotions are right now.
[12:15] Whatever is done, is done. Cheer up. How sits in such a bad mood on the first night of their wedding?
[12:24] I had thought so much Kabeer.
[12:28] You hadn't seen me completely in that dress. You hadn't complimented me.
[12:36] Falak I cannot see you upset.
[12:41] Look at me.
[12:43] You look beautiful in this dress as well.
You're just lying to keep my heart.
[12:50] Not at all. Look at yourself with my eyes.
[12:56] Falak you don't need expensive and heavy dresses to look beautiful. I mean it.
[13:06] This is our first night after our wedding. And you're wasting such precious moments only because a dress was spoiled.
[13:23] Falak. Relationships, emotions, connections,
[13:31] and love. All these are worth more than things.
[13:38] Falak please. I don't want to see you cry for such small things after today.
[13:45] I wanted to come in this room and see you in your wedding dress. I wanted to compliment you.
[13:55] But trust me, I'm so happy to have you in my life that I don't even want to think about such a thing.
[14:12] Kabeer I'm so sorry. I got very emotional. You're right.
[14:20] Its okay. Alright so now smile.
[14:31] Now we're talking. I want to see my love smiling like this. Always.
[14:42] This is for you. A present from me. I know this isn't worth anything in front of your beauty.
[14:54] But I hope you'll like it.
[15:08] This.. This is so beautiful.
Do you like it?
[15:13] Yes. Very much. Its very beautiful. Thank you so much.
[15:30] Hafsa's small mistake made such a big spectacle in front of all the guests.
[15:35] Its alright. She's a child. It happens.
[15:42] It is Hafsa's mistake, Aaliya. She's growing up. She should understand such things. Its high time.
[15:54] I made her understand.
I was thinking about Falak.
[16:00] It is her first day in the house. God knows what she must be thinking. It was a big mess.
[16:05] She's a sensible girl. I'll apologize to her in the morning.
[16:15] Alright then. You must be tired as well. Lets go and rest. Come.
[16:33] So is everything ready? I hope you didn't get anything from the market.
[16:37] Nothing. Everything is home made.
[16:41] Thats very good. Now keep everything carefully in the car. Don't miss anything.
[16:46] Mom, I'll get it done. Don't worry.
[16:49] Just that everything should reach there carefully.
[16:52] Only if Safdar and Fariha had come along, it would have been great.
[16:57] Mom, they left so late at night and you know aunt very well.
[17:03] You called, didn't you? You fulfilled your responsibility. She cannot complain now.
[17:08] Its good that she said no herself. I didn't want her to go there.
[17:12] What if she had said something wrong there. Its Falak's in laws' house. We'll have to be careful.
[17:23] God has a better plan for everything.
[17:25] Had you been feeling well and came along, it would have been different.
[17:29] Now lets get everything. Hurry up or you'll be late. Apologize to Aaliya and give my love to Falak.
[17:37] Tell her I'll come meet her.
Done. Lets keep everything in the car now.
[17:42] Be careful. You'll get oil on your clothes.
I'll see you.
[17:49] Thank God.
[18:08] How can a person change their color so quickly. Everything is changed. Your walk, your attitude. I don't believe that you...
[18:19] They should come and see now. They call me a servant's daughter.
[18:22] A servant's daughter owns such a big house now.
[18:27] It will be fun when I see her face. They'll be envious of me. Nobody has a fate like me.
[18:48] Listen..
[18:53] Hello mam.
Hello. Who are you taking this for?
[18:57] Its for you and Kabeer sir, mam.
Give it to me, I'll take it.
[19:01] I'll drop it mam.
[19:03] Who am I in this house?
You're the owner.
[19:07] So you'll do as I say. Give it to me.
[19:48] Oh Kabeer, where are you going?
I'm going to the gym.
[19:52] Here's your tea. I made it myself for you.
Oh wow. You made this tea?
[19:58] Hmm. Falak, its the first day after our wedding and you've started working.
[20:02] So what? This is my house.
[20:05] And as it is, I've decided Kabeer. I'll do all your chores myself.
[20:09] This is my good luck but we have servants to do things around the house. Now leave this.
[20:15] You don't have to do anything. They'll do everything and even take care of you.
[20:23] I want you dolled up all the time. In front of me.
[20:29] Is this so? Now drink your tea and tell me how it is?
[20:32] It must be good. How can it be bad since you made it?
[20:41] Wow. Wow.
Thank you. I hope you're not giving me fake compliments.
[20:47] Of course not. This tea, before gym.
[20:51] Hello sister. Did you reach safely?
Yes arrived safely.
[20:57] How is Naveen now?
She's better than before. Thank God she's out of danger.
[21:02] You should have come along Hamza.
You know sister, how much work keeps me busy.
[21:08] I'm trying to find a few days free. I'll definitely come and visit Naveen.
[21:14] Don't worry. She'll be absolutely fine by the grace of God.
As God wills.
[21:19] Where is mom, I want to talk to her.
[21:22] She is with Naveen in the hospital. I just came home. I need to pick a few things up.
[21:28] Alright, I'll call her myself.
Alright. You do that.
[21:32] Okay. Bye.
[21:49] Good morning. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
[21:55] I'm good.
Look at me. Tell me how do I look?
[21:59] You look absolutely beautiful. Cast away all evil eyes. Where is Kabeer?
[22:05] He went to the gym.
[22:08] Didn't mom come with you?
[22:10] No she was unwell so I asked her to rest and I'd bring your breakfast along.
[22:20] Falak, this set is so beautiful. Who gave you this?
Kabeer gave me this as a wedding present.
[22:26] Its beautiful. Are these diamonds?
Yes diamonds and its very expensive.
[22:32] I had never thought I'd be able to afford such expensive things.
[22:36] You're very lucky you have someone who loves you so much.
[22:40] That is so. Who could me luckier than me?
[22:48] Look at this.
They're calling you down for breakfast.
[22:53] Alright you go. We're coming.
[23:11] So many gifts. I haven't even opened any. Should I see whats inside?
[23:19] You got these gifts, you open them and I'll look at you.
[23:25] What is this? Lets see whats in this? Help me, will you.
[23:29] You open them, I'll look. In fact I'll do one thing. I'll take your pictures.
[24:07] No tag.
I think Hamza gave this to you.
[24:11] I'm sure.
[24:22] How is it?
[24:27] It think its very expensive.
Yeah. Its expensive.
[24:34] I think its much more expensive than the wedding present you gave me.
[24:49] Really?
[24:54] Not seriously. I was just kidding.
[25:01] There is a big difference between Hamza and I.
[25:07] Hamza is the sky and I.. I have just learnt to fly. I'm just setting up my business.
[25:18] And Hamza, his business is already established. His business is spread all over the world.
[25:23] Not only in Pakistan but outside Pakistan as well.
[25:27] Real estates, pharmacy, import export.
[25:31] Now he's partnering with us in the food business. Didn't I tell you that,
[25:37] the Kabeer Foods company that we're launching in Dubai, Hamza is a partner there as well.
[25:46] Leave everything. I'm not interested in all this. Tell me where are we going for our honeymoon?
[25:51] Really?
[25:52] You want to go on a honeymoon as well?
I'm not joking. I'm serious.
[25:58] Okay. Then you tell me, where do you want to go? Whats your favorite place?
[26:05] I want to go to Europe. I want to see the whole of Europe with you.
This is a great idea.
[26:11] Give me your passport in a day or two. I'll apply for our visas.
Really?
[26:17] Yes. My wife has asked me for something for the first time, I cannot say no. We'll be in Europe in a few days.
[26:29] My passport is at home but I'll get it. I'm so excited. Thank you so much.
[26:38] You're most welcome.
[26:42] You should always stay smiling like this. I want to see you happy. Always.
[26:51] Open the rest of the gifts.
Hmm..
[26:57] Please sit.
Thank you very much.
[27:02] Why did you have to be so formal?
[27:04] Its nothing formal at all. Like you brought everything with your happiness, we did the same.
[27:13] How is Nawal?
She's absolutely fine.
[27:16] You should have brought her along. I would have met her.
[27:18] I would have brought her along but she was busy.
[27:21] I don't see Asjad.
He must be on his way. He went out for a while.
[27:28] Sister Nausheen, that's why I called you earlier so that Asjad could be home but he still left.
[27:34] Actually Asjad is running a real estate company in partnership with his friend along with his job.
[27:41] He had a deal and they had to meet their client. He said he'd be back in half an hour. He'll be here soon.
[27:47] Hello.
Hello.
[27:52] Asjad what is this? We came to meet you and you're not at home.
[27:57] Actually I partnered with my friend last month and started a real estate business.
[28:02] A client messaged and I went to meet him.
[28:05] I was waiting for you but he called and it was important so I went to meet them.
[28:12] Did you strike the deal?
Yes thank God. We have the deal.
[28:16] Thank God.
He has also finalized two more deals, by the grace of God.
[28:21] Mom, I'm very happy today. Please have something.
[28:27] Dear, if your real estate business is going so well, why are you working a job?
[28:33] Exactly. Even I have been thinking. I'll quit if my business is settled.
[28:38] In fact I want to start an IT business along with it.
[28:42] You know the future is IT. And there are so many companies in Pakistan investing in IT.
[28:49] Asjad, all praise to the Lord, you have a very good thinking.
[28:52] I need your prayers aunty. God will give me the bounties.
[28:56] You'll be rewarded for your hard work by the grace of God.
[29:01] Your house is also very beautiful. Isn't it Sultana?
[29:06] Its the people who make a home. They give life to it.
[29:16] I cannot see your younger son around.
He's out with his friends.
[29:23] Alright. When we came over to your house, we weren't formal. Now why are you being formal? Please.
[29:30] I'm not being formal.
Dear, please serve.
[29:34] You've been searching for something ever since you came.
[29:37] I'm going on my honeymoon. That too for a month. Where? Europe.
[29:43] That's why I'm looking for my passport. I kept it here only.
All praise to the Lord.
[29:47] I cannot find it. Did you search through my room?
[29:53] Why would I go through your room?
[29:57] I'm joking. Why are you upset?
[30:02] Thank God, I found it. I came for it only.
[30:06] Good. Now wait for mom before you go. She'll be here in a while.
[30:09] Kabeer said he'd pick me up on his way back.
[30:12] He'll send it for visa stamping today only because he said it'll take many days.
[30:16] Sit for a while. Mom will be happy to meet you. She wanted to meet you yesterday also.
[30:23] Yes so I'll come back in a few days or call her.
[30:33] Hello?
Hello Kabeer. I'm free. I found my passport. Come pick me.
[30:37] Alright. I'll be there in five minutes.
Okay.
[30:42] Falak wait for a while. I'm getting tea made for you. You're in such a rush. What happened to you?
[30:49] Nothing. What would happen to me?
I'm watching you. You've changed.
[30:55] No. Why would I change? I'm still the same. Nothing has changed.
[31:02] Mom.. You returned so late. Falak was here.
Yes.
[31:08] Has she left?
Yes.
[31:11] I did ask her to wait but she was in a rush.
[31:17] She said she'd be here in a few days. She was here to get her passport.
[31:21] She's going to Europe for her honeymoon
[31:25] All praise to the Lord.
[31:28] Both of you sisters have a good fate.
[31:31] You'll have loving in laws too, just like Falak.
[31:35] Do you know? Safdar and I really like Asjad's family. They are very cultured people.
[31:42] He has his own real estate business as well. I was very excited.
[31:46] I wanted to say yes but then I thought no. I'd ask you first.
[31:52] Mom, you should do whatever you think is right. I have no objections.
[32:01] May God bless you with the best of fates dear. Those people are exactly what I had hoped from God, for you.
[32:08] They'll keep you very happy, as God wills.
[32:13] Should I make tea for you?
[32:15] No. Not now. I'm very tired. I'll rest for a bit and have tea later.
[32:31] Hello?
[32:35] No. I've resigned. I'll not rejoin.
[32:45] Why don't you understand?
[32:56] Alright. Give me some time to think. I'll tell you then.
[33:14] How do I look?
[33:21] Gorgeous. Stunning. Beautiful.
[33:28] Oh my God. How are you?
I'm fine. Are you going somewhere?
[33:36] Yes and your aunt are going out for dinner.
I also want to come with you.
[33:44] Alright. You want to go as well? Fine. Ask mom to get you ready.
[33:51] But mom isn't home.
[33:54] Hmm. Then what should we do? By the way you look good in this as well. You look good in everything.
[34:02] Thank you.
[34:03] Now lets go. Okay?
[34:08] Hafsa will go with us?
Yes. She'll go with us.
[34:13] See how excited she is.
[34:16] Her mother isn't home. How can we just take her along?
[34:20] She'll bother us. She's a kid.
[34:22] Its alright. Hafsa and I often go out together. Sometimes on dinner, sometimes ice cream and sometimes just to hang out.
[34:28] And without sister Aaliya. Its alright. I'll make her understand. She won't bother.
[34:34] I'm waiting for you downstairs. Come fast. Don't be late.
[34:48] I have called Asjad's mother and said yes. 
[34:52] She wants us to arrange the wedding soon. 
[34:55] I said we just got one of my daughters married. I cannot marry off another one so soon.
[35:02] She said if we cannot have the wedding, we can at least have the engagement.
[35:06] So what did you say?
[35:08] What could I say? Even I want this. To have an official ceremony.
[35:16] Alright.
[35:19] Do one thing. When is Falak going for her honeymoon?
[35:22] We'll have your engagement ceremony before she leaves.
[35:28] Alright. I'll ask her and tell you.
[35:53] Come along.
Lets go.
[35:55] Lets go.
[36:03] Kabeer ask Hafsa to sit at the back.
But I've always sat in front with my uncle.
[36:12] Lets do one thing. We can sit together.
[36:15] So cute. She even made a place for you. Come sit.
[36:25] I don't want to go.
Falak? Falak?
[36:30] Falak wait. Falak? What childish act is this?
[36:35] This isn't a childish act. We had a plan. Can we not go alone?
[36:41] Falak, we always go alone.
[36:43] Hafsa is going with us for the first time. Why are you being so hyper on such small thing?
[36:49] I have no problems with Hafsa.
[36:52] But I wanted to spend time with you. I wanted to talk to you and listen to you. This is no way.
[36:58] So what do you do when we're at home?
[37:01] What do we do? You're always busy. You have phone calls. Then your friends come over. You have meetings. 
[37:06] You don't have time for me.
[37:08] We'll discuss later. Come sit in the car and Hafsa is coming with us. 
[37:14] We're getting late.
[37:23] What is Hafsa doing?
[37:25] She went on dinner with Falak and Kabeer.
[37:29] What? And you let her go.
[37:31] I didn't know she was going with them. Nasreen told me.
[37:36] And you know Kabeer. He has his life in Hafsa.
[37:40] She must have insisted and he took her along.
[37:42] They must have wanted to spend some personal time together. Talk to each other.
[37:46] It was different earlier but she'll bother them now.
Yes but it just skipped my mind.
[37:52] I told you I didn't know. I just found out.
[37:56] I'm amazed that you didn't think about it.
Now what can we do? She's gone.
[38:03] Touqeer. I don't understand this man. Oh God.
[38:10] See, you know very well I just got Falak married.
[38:16] It will we very difficult for me to get Nawal married right away. I need time.
[38:23] Alright then. I have accepted one of your things, now you also accept one of the things I have to say.
[38:29] Yes?
[38:30] I want them to sign the marriage document rather than just being engaged.
