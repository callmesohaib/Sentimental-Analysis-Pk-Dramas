[02:03] Wow! Amazing!
[02:07] You did a nice decor Falak! You changed the look of this room.
[02:11] Yes mother! I spent some time on it. It had to look good.
[02:17] Hey listen! Do what I told you to do.
[02:24] Shut down some lights and make some noise outside the room of sister Naval!
[02:29] No! Just break the vases near her room.
[02:32] Hey! What are you saying? It's expensive.
[02:34] Then what mother? It's not expensive than your daughters. Go and do it. Go!
[02:39] Nothing is wrong! How do you feel?
[02:42] I feel good! You are so naughty!
[03:21] HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
[03:32] Happy birthday! Do you like the surprise?

[03:40] Obviously! You are the only person in this world whose birthday I remember.
[03:46] Thank you!
[03:47] Stay happy and stay safe! Lots of love!
[03:51] Stay happy!
[03:52] Mother! You knew it too but you didn't let me realize.
[03:56] Falak wanted to surprise you! How could I tell?
[03:59] Why are we standing! Mother! Let's cut the cake! Come!
[04:31] Where are you going?
[04:33] I'm getting ready for the office! You should do your breakfast quickly. I'll drop you to the university.
[04:38] No! Wait! I'm not going to the university today! Neither are you going to your office.
[04:44] Why?
[04:45] That's because today is your birthday and we will celebrate it together and spend some time together.
[04:51] Listen! We can do it after official timings. I have an important meeting in the office.
[04:57] Nothing is important! I've told the administration of your office that you are sick!
[05:07] No Falak! You are joking! You are joking, right? Mother! Is she joking?
[05:10] No! I'm not joking! I knew it that you'll go to office.
[05:13] That's why I have called your office and settled everything.
[05:19] You are so naughty! You shouldn't lie!
[05:24] It's not wrong to lie for your happiness.
[05:29] No! One shouldn't lie at all.
[05:32] But why don't you stop? It's your birthday today and a good day.
[05:37] Spend your day with us! You are getting this chance after such a long time.
[05:41] Yes! Now you should give us a treat in a 5 star restaurant.
[05:47] Check the demands.
[05:49] You are forgetting something! You always gift me something on your birthday. Where's my gift?
[05:55] Fine! I'll take you for shopping!
[05:59] Really?
[06:00] I love you!
[06:01] I love you more!
[06:54] Greetings!  Greetings!
[06:57] Good morning! I got your favorite omelet fried for you.
[07:01] Thank you sister in law! Hey!
[07:04] Do you remember? We have a meeting at 11.
[07:09] You are speaking like you want to settle a score for your own self! I'll be there before you!
[07:16] My wife was a great housewife! Now she is a business woman.
[07:21] I didn't do anything! She is already a business woman.
[07:25] In fact if she wasn't my partner in business. I wouldn't be so successful.
[07:29] Wow! You say the truth.
[07:32] It is the truth but somebody is being jealous.
[07:37] Hey! It's an honest confession. My heart did feel jealous.
[07:40] See! It took me 10 years to develop my real estate business.
[07:44] But still I didn't get that much of profit compared to your business.
[07:50] I'm actually really happy for you guys.
[07:52] Look at the team! Do you have such a team?
[07:57] You are right! You both are intelligent and legible for business.
[08:01] Team work bro! Team work! Me and sister in law are not just good at business but really good at handling house matters.
[08:07] I do understand and I'm proud of both of you!
[08:10] I have to go on a visit in the evening!
[08:13] I have to choose the curtains for the 1st floor too.
[08:17] I'm thinking that I might need your help!
[08:22] I shared details with periments for Hafsa's birthday! Talk to them about the budget! I won't have the time.
[08:30] Don't worry! You have to rest when you reach home. I'm scared that you might get sick because you work so hard.
[08:39] She won't!
[08:41] You know that sister in law doesn't feel easy if she doesn't arrange the kitchen herself.
[08:47] Exactly!
[08:48] You both don't eat until I make it!
[08:51] He has a point!
[08:54] Hey! Your birthday is near! Do you have a good mood or bad mood for the school?
[08:59] Good mood!
[09:00] Uncle! The milk isn't finished.
[09:04] What? You haven't finished your milk? Drink it!
[09:30] Congratulations to you all! We are opening a new branch.
[09:35] This branch is successful because of..
[09:43] Sister in law!
[09:44] No! It's all because of our team. Thank you everybody! This is all because of your efforts.
[09:48] Sure! It's a team work.

[17:03] You might think that I'm a burden!
[17:06] What happened Falak? Why do you think like this?
[17:09] Sometimes I think that I'm a burden.

[17:43] You said this in front of me the last time. You should only focus on one thing.
[17:48] You should work on your studies and score high grades. Don't think about the job. I earn!
[17:54] I earn for you guys! Don't worry!
[17:57] If you ask me a hundred times! I won't mind.

[18:37] Can any person change their colors so fast?
[18:43] I cannot believe that you have changed so much.
[19:05] I am feeling proud of you! You've maintained this house so well after I left.
[19:12] You are right! Tell me one thing!
[19:16] How do you manage everything? I am always busy with household but I cannot manage it so well.
[19:23] How do you do this?
[19:24] If you ask me the truth! This is all because of Navaal.
[19:29] She has handled the whole house herself and I don't need to maintain it myself!
[19:33] Greetings uncle! Greetings aunt! How are you?
[19:37] Greetings! How are you?

[19:54] It's was fine! I just need to rest.
[19:58] Where's Falak? Isn't she back?
[20:00] I called her! She told me that she is on the way!
[20:03] She is irresponsible! I told her to come early.
[20:40] Oh god! What did you do?
[20:42] Madam! Forgive me! I was going straight! You came in reverse direction.
[20:50] Are you flying an airplane on road? What about this damage now?
[20:55] Madam! I'm a poor man! I'm the driver of this car.
[20:58] How can I manage your damage? I'm poor!
[21:02] What are you looking at? Move it!
[21:05] Yes madam!
[21:09] Poor?
[21:19] Hello!
[21:21] Falak! Where are you? You haven't reached!
[21:23] Navaal! I had an accident.

[22:09] I don't like your misjudging!
[22:12] She is right! making stranger a daughter is something else.
[22:18] Yes! I have adopted her.
[22:20] I think of her as my own child!
[22:24] What happens if you think? Reality is reality! Your own blood is your own.
[22:32] Aunt! Falak is my sister!
[22:35] I don't like when someone calls her daughter of maid!
[22:44] Call her and ask where she is?
[22:56] Falak! Is everything alright? Are you injured?
[23:00] Yes mother! I'm fine! It's just a normal accident.
[23:05] I've told you so many times to drive carefully!

[23:48] Hey! She is my daughter.
[23:52] She is the younger sister of Navaal! Why are you speaking like this?
[24:08] You should just stop sometimes.!
[24:10] What did I say?
[24:13] Sultana! Don't mind!
[24:24] I added a lot of chilies in the dinner today. I thought you wouldn't eat so much.
[24:29] Everything was perfect!
[24:31] You always make good food! Today it was great. I ate too much.
[24:38] The food was so good! I really need green tea! With honey and lemon!
[24:48] You'll be blamed if I get fat!
[24:53] I've decided! I need to find a beautiful girl for you to marry.
[25:00] So that she comes and makes good food!
[25:03] You appreciate her! Blame her for your fatness. What do you say Tauqeer?
[25:09] I'm saying that from long time! He doesn't listen.
[25:13] I was talking about food! What's with my marriage?
[25:17] Tell me! Do you like any girl?
[25:22] You know it better that I'm not into love.
[25:30] I like this after marriage!
[25:33] A man should be loved by his wife!
[25:40] You still need a girl for that! We are asking if you have met someone already!
[25:46] You are always outside and enjoying! Don't tell me that you've never met a girl that you felt interested in!
[25:52] You thought about marriage!
[25:55] You both know my daily routine!
[25:58] Office from home and back!
[26:01] I just have lunch or dinner sometimes.
[26:04] I'm asking about friends!
[26:07] Exactly! Just like I met her in my university.
[26:10] My first and last love!
[26:15] OK!
[26:17] My first love..
[26:23] My business!
[26:26] Done!
[26:27] Exactly!
[26:28] I should tell you that if this happens then he'll never marry!
[26:33] You should find a girl for him yourself and do everything quickly! That's the only way!
[26:41] I'll wear some fancy suits and enjoy a lot! I'll do dances too!
[26:51] You've started planning already!
[26:53] The celebration has started.
[26:55] We just have to find a girl.
[26:57] Really? Which song will you sing?
[27:14] Can any person change so quick?
[27:20] Looks and get up is changed.
[27:24] I cannot believe!
[27:27] Where are you? Here!
[27:31] This is your grocery! Sent by sir!
[27:37] May god keep them happy! They care for us.
[27:41] You are right! These people are running the world properly.
[27:47] You remember we were in hard times.
[27:51] Thank god I found job! Sir cares for us too!
[27:55] I'll work hard!
[27:57] So that they stay happy from us.
[28:00] God gave us a gift for patience! We did something good that we got such people in return.
[28:08] We would've been in hardships our whole life.
[28:12] We would've had the worst life.
[28:16] You are right! We didn't even have a supporting blood relation.
[28:21] We are servants.
[28:25] Enough! Don't cry like this. Sit here with me.
[28:31] You shouldn't cry like this. You are a good girl.
[28:37] Father told me that her parent's have passed away!
[28:42] Yes! That's why she'll stay with us.
[28:47] You'll keep her in your room!
[28:49] She makes noise! I won't allow her in my room.
[28:51] Don't say like that! If Falak doesn't stay with u then she has to go to orphanage.
[28:57] And you always wanted a younger sister! You'll find a new sister.
[29:03] Falak! Will you become the younger sister of Navaal?
[29:07] Great!
[29:09] OK mother! Come Falak! I'll show you my toys.
[29:15] Falak!
[29:23] Mother is calling! Come! Uncle and aunt are going. You should meet them.
[29:29] I didn't like it! Tell mother.
[29:34] What do people get from hurting other people?
[29:43] Don't get hurt by what they say. You know they say whatever the have on their tongue.
[29:53] This is not my wrong! That I was born in a poor family.
[29:56] Is this really my fault that I was a child of servants?
[30:00] Why are you thinking about this?
[30:03] If you feel hurt by the sayings of people then you'll make your life hard.
[30:10] Listen! Get fresh and come down.
[30:15] Don't let them know that you are hurt by their words.
[30:21] You know the rule! Don't act emotional in front of them.
[30:26] Now come!
[30:43] You are goings so early!
[30:47] You know it better that a person can sleep properly in their own house.
[30:51] We'll keep visiting!
[30:54] Sure! I'll go check on Navaal.
[30:57] Fine!
[31:02] Navaal! What are you doing? They are leaving.
[31:07] Mother! I winding up.
[31:16] Looks like you are hurt by our words.
[31:22] Yes aunt! I felt hurt for a little bit.
[31:26] I told my heart that some people exist in this world who are not happy for people. I felt better after that.
[31:34] What is this way of talking?
[31:38] Stay in your limits.
[31:41] You should too!
[31:49] It's just that she has adopted you!
[31:53] You know it better that you would've never seen such life.
[32:01] You are being fed as a snake!
[32:06] Aunt! I'm just lucky!
[32:10] And luck brought me here!
[32:15] just see that I'm seeing you off so disrespectfully.
[32:23] Be careful!
[32:27] You are so disrespectful. Nobody should talk to you.
[32:33] Sultana! Where are you!
[32:41] Quick!
[32:46] Yes?
[32:48] I was just packing somethings.
[32:51] What was the need for this? We ate properly!
[32:56] Keep this for my happiness!
[32:58] Sure! Goodbye!
[33:00] Goodbye!
[33:24] Greetings!   Greetings!
[33:29] I'm so tired!
[33:37] Thank you!
[33:46] Mother! Did you go somewhere outside?
[33:50] Yes! I went to Mrs. Ahsan.
[33:52] Why?
[33:54] Mother! Do you remember about Anaya's mehndi?
[33:57] We are invited! It's must!
[34:00] I remember! Her parents came to invite us.
[34:04] What are you wearing?
[34:06] I'll wear anything! She has the problem.
[34:09] Yes!
[34:11] It's obvious! Anaya is a good friend to me. 
[34:15] I'm way to excited for her marriage. I've practiced some dances too.
[34:19] I'll wear a designer suit!
[34:23] Good! Just bring a nice looking dress. That will make you happy.
[34:30] Oh! Navaal!
[34:32] Mrs. Ahsan was saying that there a nice proposal for Navaal!
[34:37] The boy is a foreign national. He is a business man and belongs to a good family. He is well educated.
[34:45] He'll take his wife to foreign too! I was thinking to invite them over here.
[34:49] We'll see the boy too!
[34:52] Wow mother! Invite them over here on this weekend. Navaal will finally get married. We'll have fun.
[34:59] No! Not at all. You'll invite no one. I don't want to marry anyone.
[35:04] Why not? When the boy is well settled. He belongs to a nice family. Why don't you want to marry?
[35:11] I still have to do a lot! Marriage isn't in my plans.
[35:17] I'll think after sometime.
[35:21] Mother! If she doesn't marry! You should get me married.
[35:27] I won't disagree.
[35:29] Yes! Get her married.
[35:31] No! You are elder.
[35:33] She is young! You'll get married before! I'll arrange her marriage after you.
[35:40] Sure! Just don't force me. Let me chase my dreams.
[35:50] Sister! I suggest you that you get married.
[35:53] You'll get dresses and new jewelry!
[36:04] Mother!
[36:05] Yes?
[36:06] Anum is coming to pick me!
[36:09] She has invited all friends on a party! Should I go too?
[36:12] Why?
[36:13] It's her birthday! That's why!
[36:16] Please! please!
[36:20] You should have asked before planning.
[36:24] Now you should go!
[36:26] Thank you! Thank you!
[36:28] Come quick!
[36:54] Excuse me! Ladies and gentleman. Our owners want to talk to you.
