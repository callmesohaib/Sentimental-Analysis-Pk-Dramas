[00:14] Your complaints are right but its not Falak's fault.
[00:18] When did I say Falak is at fault?
[00:21]  But at least if she had told me herself, I wouldn't have been so shocked. 
[00:25] that the person I love the most in the world,
[00:30]  will lie to me. 
[00:32] She'll hide her truth from me
[00:37] Would you have married me if you had known the truth?
[00:42] She is pregnant
[00:47] you are about to become a father, congratulations!
[00:49] what! 
heartiest congratulations!
[00:58] heartiest congratulations! I am so happy for you
[01:01] I don't know, I am unable to understand anything
[01:05] so early! I have never thought about a baby
[01:09] what? Don't you want a baby?
[01:13] I don't know
[01:15] I have never think about it
[01:16] if you haven't then think about it now, what's there to worry a lot?
[01:22] how will I be able to take a child's responsibility? How will I handle it? What will I do?
[01:26] what's there to worry about?
[01:28] you will learn how to handle a baby as well, don't take much stress
[01:34] madam Falak, maam is calling you
[01:41] you go, I am coming
[01:42] Okay
[01:44] don't know why sister Nawal was so hasty in telling everyone about it
[01:49] she could have waited for some time
[01:51] anyways, I'll talk to you later. Bye!
[02:00] heartiest congratulations to you!
[02:02] heartiest congratulations to you too! 
Where is Falak? She didn't come?
[02:07] she is resting in her room, I have called her. She must be coming
[02:11] what was the need to call her here? You could have let her rest, we can go & meet her inside her room
[02:15] Exactly!
[02:17] did you tell Kabir? What did he said?
[02:23] I had told him, its just...
[02:29] oh Falak, heartiest congratulations to you!
did you see?
[02:33] Kabir didn't come, right?
[02:34] he didn't come after listening to such a big news! His anger didn't lessened
[02:39] I mean he doesn't care about me at all, He doesn't want to live with me
[02:45] Fine, if this is the matter then I will also take away my life!
[02:47] oh Falak!
I shouldn't live anymore
[02:49] if nobody can live with me then what will I do by living without him. Its better for me to die
[02:53] Falak, leave the knife...
[02:56] leave it
[02:59] Falak! Falak,, handle yourself
[03:01] Falak, open your eyes
Falak
[03:22] don't know what's written in my child's fate
[03:27] why she doesn't get any complete happiness
[03:31] you are a mother & God listens to a mother's prayers quickly
[03:36] just pray for Falak's good fate
[03:40] I always pray for her happiness
[03:46] she is precious to me
[03:49] I have done her upbringing as my own child
[03:53] aunty, I have worried you a lot
[03:57] I'm sorry
[04:00] No dear, we did a mistake
[04:07] I hope that you'll forgive us
[04:10] please don't do this, you are making me feel guilty
[04:15] Falak
[04:17] I will take good care of her, don't worry
[04:25] how is Falak now?
[04:28] She is better
[04:30] let me see...
[04:35] she is better, please sit
[04:38] come here
[04:42] she is absolutely fine, don't worry
[05:29] are you upset?
[05:38] you should be
[05:43] as I have hurt you
[05:46] how quickly you have realized about my heart
[05:49] Tell me honestly, do you care for me or...
[05:54] Falak
[05:57] the happiness of the baby has its own importance
[06:03] but the baby's mother is more important for me
[06:07] Lie!
[06:09] look into my eyes
[06:11] you'll believe me
[06:17] you are so bad
[06:20] very bad
[06:21] do you know how scared I was! I thought I have lost you
[06:26] where I would have gone if you had become angry from me?
[06:31] It cannot happen
[06:35] and you know, I cannot see tears in your eyes
[06:39] I cannot tolerate it
[06:43] then why do you make me cry?
[06:46] I made a mistake
[06:49] I won't do it ever
[06:52] I'm sorry!
[07:02] Falak, thank you so much
[07:05] for giving me such a big happiness
[07:51] what is all this, Kabir?
[07:52] a beautiful welcome of my to-be baby & his mother

[08:32] hmmm.... you talk quite a lot
[08:37] and don't take so much care of me, I am not unwell though
[08:40] I have to take so much care of you
[08:43] don't you remember what the doctor had said?
[08:46] you will not take care of yourself, so I have to do it
[09:04] you have surprised me, mom had told me that you are coming next week
[09:08] yes, then I thought since I have to go alone so why not

[09:15] haven't you told mom?
[09:17] No, I haven't
[09:18] yes! its a surprise for her
[09:22] do you know Hamza, I am so excited for your wedding
[09:26] I was unable to wait. I wanted to come to you guys immediately
[09:33] I have been keeping all the desires inside my heart for so long
[09:37] I'm so happy for you & you made a very good decision
[09:42] do you know, whenever I used to see you. Don't know what would have happened to me
[09:47] you are my only brother. And I always wanted to see you very happy
[09:52] your happiness is precious to me

[09:59] even mom is happy, how is Nawal?
[10:02] She is fine
[10:05] She is fine, means?
[10:07] did you tell her about my arrival?

[11:30] its only because of your work experience
[11:33] I hope that you will not disappoint me
[11:37] thank you sir, I will try my level best
[11:41] then understand that your promotion is confirmed
[11:52] yes Ibrahim, what do you think? Can Ms. Nawal do it?
[11:56] Absolutely sir! just wait & watch, I know her very well
[12:00] if she takes the responsibility of some work then she ensures to complete it
[12:04] just think that you have already got this tender
[12:10] Falak
[12:13] come
[12:14] keep it here
[12:19] what is all this? Why are you keeping it here?
[12:22] hey! one feels like eating something so you can keep eating
[12:27] there is no need to climb the stairs again & again, rest as much as you can
[12:32] no sister, you know I am allergic to fruits smell
[12:36] Besides, if I need anything then I will order it from downstairs
[12:40] Falak, no more excuses! Just keep eating in a bit
[12:45] sister is absolutely correct!
[12:48] you have to be strict now, as she doesn't listens to me at all
[12:52] I had sent the soup for her, but she had sent it back without tasting it
[12:56] this way you'll feel more weakness
[12:58] sister, this is not my department. You have to handle it please
[13:04] yes, I wasn't in a mood to drink it at that time. And I cannot force myself to drink it
[13:13] Look, the doctor had said that you have so much of weakness
[13:18] you have to take care of your diet & food intake
[13:21] in this condition, one needs to eat even if she doesn't feel like. Are you getting it?
[13:29] come on, over to you
[13:42] Okay fine, do eat whenever you feel like
[13:48] sister has arrived, maybe she'll visit your house within a few days
[13:51] its such a good news, and you are telling this to me now?
[13:55] it was a surprise! She was at the airport when she had called me
[13:59] I just came back to office after dropping her home
[14:02] why did you came back? All good?
[14:04] I have a meeting with a client
[14:06] there is a very big project & I have to prepare its presentation
[14:11] Nawal, if I get this project
[14:14] then my business will be expanded more
[14:17] and I want to get it at any cost
[14:20] nobody can beat Hamza, you will get it
[14:24] Thanks!
[14:26] since you have said it, so success is evident
[14:30] Okay I'll talk to you later, but please do talk to my sister Ok?
[14:35] Okay, bye!
[14:39] Sir, check this presentation once then we'll discuss the quotation
[15:02] Falak, be careful... 
what happened?
[15:06] one needs to be careful in this condition otherwise one can incur a loss
[15:10] be little careful
[15:12] I do take care. Shall I always stay inside my room now?
[15:16] when did I said that? But its important to stay cautious
[15:19] yes, I was feeling suffocated inside the room that's why I came outside
[15:23] then ask Kabir to take you for an outing
[15:28] he hardly have any time for me
[15:31] what! let me ask him. Its his duty to take care of you
[15:36] I was going inside the kitchen, do let me know if you want anything
[15:39] No sister, thank you!
[15:46] oh God! When I will get rid of it
[15:52] mom, what's this? Neither any preparations or decoration?
[15:56] it doesn't look like a wedding house, does a wedding house looks like this?
[16:00] how are they then?
[16:02] mom, I had asked you to decorate the entire house with flowers, keep some dance party after all its your only son's wedding
[16:10] such a simple environment, no music or hungama
[16:14] you have amazed me!
[16:16] Ok fine, a lot of days are left for the wedding. Everything will be done
[16:19] since you have come now, so I am not worried
[16:22] let me make the guests list first, I hope I don't miss anyone
[16:26] you can tell me the names later on if anyone is left
Ok
[16:28] yes, I will do everything 
[16:32] Ok mom, call the interior designer & the music dj tomorrow
[16:36] you guys are sitting so relaxed as if a lot of months are left for the wedding
[16:40] we hardly have one month's time
[16:43] and this one month will pass so quickly that you guys will not realize
[16:48] by the way Hamza, Nazish is right
[16:53] we are taking the time for granted, a lot of work is there
[16:57] lets distribute it, so that it will be done quickly
[17:00] as you wish!
[17:01] I will get everything decorated as per my wish
[17:05] listen Hamza, when does Nawal gets free from her office?

[17:22] hey! we have to get your room decorated. We still have to finalize the color scheme
[17:27] do you know, how much time does this work takes?
[17:30] everyone is sitting so relaxed here
[17:34] by the way mom, I am so happy by sister's arrival

[17:51] yes yes, absolutely correct. Whatever you say, all good!
[18:04] hey Falak Falak... 
[18:07] you shouldn't be wearing such high heels, you could have fall if I wouldn't have handled you
[18:13] I can handle myself but thanks for your support

[18:18] See, its your first baby that's why I am saying it. Otherwise you are wise enough
[18:25] yes, I can do everything on my own. Also I know what is right or wrong

[22:18] you have suffered through such a big problem all alone!

[24:18] sister Nawal, did you see?
[24:19] yes where is Kabir & Aliya?
[24:21] they just left, they have gone to the branch
[24:24] I don't understand what is going on. I am so worried, don't know how come all of this had happened?
[24:29] Falak, take care of yourself and don't get unwell
[24:32] who told you, sister?
[24:34] just now Hamza called me to inform. Mom is quite worried, talk to her
[24:39] hello! dear Falak. Don't worry, have courage my dear
[24:45] See, there is God's betterment in everything
[24:48] God takes you out of some other big problem by indulging you into a small one
[24:53] believe me my dear
[24:55] mom, what betterment can there be in it?
[24:57] do you even know how much loss is incurred?
[24:59] if you get to know that how much loss we have incurred, then you wouldn't have said this ever
[25:04] Ok, but how did this happened?
[25:06] they are saying it was a short circuit, a lot of people are trapped inside
[25:10] don't know what will happen now
[25:11] I know you are alone, and you must be worried
[25:15] I had asked Nawal to take me to your house, but she didn't agreed
[25:19] God willing we'll visit you tomorrow
[25:21] mom, there has been such a big problem how can I not worry?
[25:25] do come in the morning
[25:28] I am having a splitting headache, just now I took a medicine
[25:30] I will talk to you later
[25:32] you did very well. Did you had supper? Take rest
[25:36] yes mom, I had it already. I will talk to you later
[25:42] the news is the fire in the branch of Kabir food is under controlled
[25:48] thank God!
the entire staff & workers have been taken out safely
[25:54] there hasn't been any sort of loss of life
[25:57] oh God thanks to you!
[26:01] it seems that worries have seen the way of my daughter's house
[26:05] ask her to give charity tomorrow, it will keep her safe
I will tell her
[26:27] Kabir, the board of directors are here. The meeting is about to start
[26:32] show come courage & come
[26:35] how can I show courage, sister?
[26:39] here we have incurred a loss of millions, I don't understand what to do
[26:44] nothing is in our control
[26:47] think it as God's will
[26:52] It seems as if the branch isn't burnt
[26:55] but my dreams are burnt
[26:57] its a long journey now
[27:00] and so much of hopelessness is not good in the beginning
[27:03] look, if the office staff will see you so hopeless then their hopes will also die
[27:11] try & look at the bright side. Thanks God that we haven't lost any life
[27:19] maam, all the board of directors are inside the waiting room
[27:28] we are coming
Ok
[27:32] Kabir, right now you have to give strength to everyone
[27:37] its such a difficult time right now
[27:41] but... if we'll stand together shoulder to shoulder
[27:46] then this difficult time will also pass
[27:49] lets go, come on
[28:03] Kabir... Kabir, are you fine?
[28:13] a person who has experienced such a huge loss, how can he be fine?
[28:20] the company's reputation has been badly damaged
[28:28] it takes several years to make a company's reputation but...
[28:33] just a moment.. everything got ruined in just a moment
[28:40] Kabir
[28:43] Pray to God, everything will be fine
[28:52] I am thinking to bring Falak to our house for a few days
[28:56] the situation of her house right now isn't good for Falak's health
[29:02] she needs rest & peace
[29:04] mom, what are you saying?
[29:07] Kabir is going through a very difficult time & he needs Falak
[29:11] when a person is going through such times, then he needs his life partner the most
[29:16] but Nawal what if her health gets badly affected by it, then?
[29:19] don't worry, she is fine
[29:24] Okay
[29:26] God will help her
[29:32] Noor
[29:33] greetings madam!
[29:34] greetings! where is everyone? I can't see anyone
[29:37] Mr. Kabir has gone to the office
[29:39] so early?
[29:40] yes, actually madam Aliya was saying that due to some meeting they had to leave early
[29:44] shall I make breakfast for you?
[29:47] Not right now 
ok
[29:51] don't do this, Mr. Omer. I can't believe that you are backing out so quickly
[29:58] Mr. Omer look, I know that there has been a loss but nothing will happen to the company
[30:03] have trust in me
[30:05] please don't do this
[30:07] yes yes
[30:09] nothing is confirmed as of yet, soon we'll get to know whether its a mistake or some conspiracy
[30:14] but I request you again, please don't do this
[30:19] please don't cancel this deal just because of a small accident
[30:39] sister, Mr. Omer Hayat had called
[30:44] he has canceled the deal
[30:48] also he has taken out the entire investment
[30:54] a lot of rumors are spreading in the market
[30:58] actually our competitors have got a chance to make gossips
[31:04] they can ruin anyone's name if they cannot ruin their work
[31:09] no problem, we'll see everyone
[31:13] don't worry, God willing everything will be fine
[31:17] one after another problem, I just don't know
[31:36] this is not required, Nawal
its alright
[31:39] come here, sit with me
[31:41] actually I wanted to meet you & talk to you. I wanted to thank you!
[31:47] thank you for what?
[31:50] to hold Hamza's hand
[31:54] mom & I had tried our level best, Nawal but Hamza wasn't agreeing for the marriage
[32:01] and you know how stubborn he is
[32:05] mom had lost complete hope
[32:09] and Hamza had said it clearly that he will not get married
[32:13] but the decision you both took to start your life together. I am so happy for that
[32:20] and I am sure that he will take care of you. He will take very good care of you, he will keep you very happy
[32:27] yes greetings aunty! how are you?

Yes, I am fine
