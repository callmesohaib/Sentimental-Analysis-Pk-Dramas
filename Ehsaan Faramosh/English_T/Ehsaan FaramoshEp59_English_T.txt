[00:12] In the beginning, I was definitely hurt, but because of Kabir, this pain was also cured.
[00:18] Both you and Falak deserve each other wholly.
[00:22] You wont go to office from tomorrow.
[00:25] I have appointed new finance person in your place.
[00:28] How can you do this Hamza?
So what should I do?
[00:31] OK, if you want to get funds from me then share details of these projects with me.
[00:38] I will give you funds after reviewing project details.
[00:51] OK.
[01:11] How much is the share of sister Nazish in this business and in this house?
[01:14] Do you know, what has she said to me?
[01:17] She said that if she will withdraw her share from this business and house then you will have nothing.
[01:28] I am sorry Hamza, I can't sign these documents.
[01:31] I think you are not paying attention to business as you should.
[01:42] If you want to get funds from me then share details of these projects with me.
[01:47] I will give you funds after reviewing project details.
[01:53] Two production units have been shut down there and there is some problem in production over there.
[01:59] Clients have filed case on our company because the haven't received consignment on time.
[02:03] We will have to pay heavy penalties Hamza.
[02:19] Greetings, how are you Mr. Khurram?
[02:24] I want you do something for me.
[02:28] I need some loan.
[02:35] Yes.
[02:39] How many days will this process take?
[02:43] I mean that how much time will it take to get funds transferred in my account after application?
[02:52] OK, I will send my Manager.
[02:59] Please apply on my behalf. Thank you.
[03:05] Yes sure. I will come to your office very soon. Thanks again.
[03:09] Good bye.
[03:33] Aunt. Aunt.
Oh.
[03:36] Are you blind?
[03:38] You keep running here and there without reason. Why don't you understand?
[03:41] This is not your house.
[03:43] How dare you to slap my daughter?
[03:46] Are you blind? Aren't you seeing that she has dropped tea on me
[03:48] She is just a child and mistakenly dropped tea on you but you slapped her?
[03:53] If you will slap her again then I will break your hands Falak.
[03:57] OK, I wont beat her but why don't you control her?
[04:02] How dare you to say this?
It's enough.
[04:14] Don't try to beat me again.
[04:16] I have endured so many cruelty from you.
[04:18] If you again dare to beat me then I will behave in a very bad way.
[04:26] Falak.
[04:29] Behave yourself. You are talking without thinking. What's wrong with you?
[04:33] I am talking in that tone which I should have used much earlier.
[04:39] You daughter understands this tone.
[04:42] All the time I am humiliated in this house. But now I will not tolerate that anymore.
[04:47] Let Hamza come, he will make you understand.
[04:49] Here he is. Tell him about your complaints.
[04:52] He should know that what do you do all day with me in this house?
[04:56] What happened? Why is this noise in the house?
[04:58] Ask your sister, who is habitual of creating dramas.
[05:02] Hamza, make your wife understand that don't test my patience
[05:06] otherwise I will behave in a very bad way.
[05:14] What is left to be done with me?
[05:16] I am humiliated all the time in this house. I don't have any single moment of peace and calmness.
[05:21] Falak.
[05:22] Let's go to room. We will talk there.
[05:24] I am not going anywhere. Whatever will be discussed will discuss here.
[05:27] Ever since I have come in this house after my marriage. They didn't allow me to pass a single day with peace in this house.
[05:31] You go to office but they keep taunting me all the time.
[05:34] Now whatever will be discussed will discuss in front of you right here.
[05:37] It's enough Falak.
[05:38] Don't behave rudely.
[05:39] Why do I stop? She has problem with me but why is she living here?
[05:43] Why don't you leave this house. Go to your house. Let me live peacefully in my house and you also live peacefully at your house.
[05:50] Falak
[05:56] Now don't let a word come out of your mouth otherwise I will behave in a very bad way.
[06:00] I am trying to make you understand but you aren't understanding.
[06:05] Apologize to sister and mom right now right away.
[06:19] Why do I apologize? When I haven't done anything wrong then why do I apologize?
[06:25] Apologize to both of them right now right away.
[06:43] Otherwise the door is right there, you can go.
[06:47] Do you have idea that what are you saying? You are asking me to leave this house?
[06:52] You go to office but do you have any idea that how much both of them taunt me and humiliate me whole day?
[06:57] I totally understand, my family can't behave that rudely like you have done to them.
[07:16] So, apologize to them right now right away.
[07:25] Apologize to them.
[07:44] I am sorry.
[08:22] You are looking beautiful.
[08:24] Thank you. What's the matter? You are looking very happy.
[08:29] Yes it's a matter of happiness.
[08:32] Qaiser called me and told me that the meeting has been scheduled with investor.
[08:37] Investor is ready to do investment on our terms and conditions.
[08:44] That's great news.
[08:51] You know what, all of this happening only because of you.
[08:56] Ever since you have come in my life everything is going well.
[09:03] I strongly believe that you must be the reward of my good deed.
[09:12] I mean it.
[09:19] Madam, miss Elham is ready.
[09:25] Let's go.
[09:26] Come to me my dear. Let's go.
[09:32] Let's go.
[09:40] Hamza make your wife understand that don't test my patience
[09:45] otherwise I will behave in a very bad way.
[09:49] Do you have any idea that what are you saying to me? You are asking me to leave this house?
[09:53] You go to office but both of them taunt me and humiliate me, do you have any idea about that?
[10:10] As I said, apologize to both of them right now right away.
[10:17] Otherwise the door is right there and you can go.
[10:47] I am sorry.
[11:03] God has given you so much respite Falak.
[11:06] But I must say one thing that "Karma" is a reality of life.
[11:11] You will have to bear the consequences of your wrong doings.
[11:15] And God does not waste anyone's patience.
[11:44] Sorry Falak.
[11:46] I was too hyper but you should have thought before talking to them.
[11:53] No one behaved that rudely with sister in this house till date.
[11:57] You have broken all the trust and pride I had in you today.
[12:08] Today I realized that I am just like any other non living thing in this house.
[12:14] Which has no worth.
[12:24] Whoever wants to humiliate me he/she will do that but I can't say anything in response. Right?
[12:30] What difference does it make?
[12:35] You should understand this as well.
[12:38] Your rude behavior with sister is creating problems for me.
[12:44] And what do you think about their behavior with me?
[12:52] No matter what they do,
[12:55] no one will ask them but if I say anything then they will beat me.
[13:02] But there is a proper way to talk.
[13:04] If you had any problem with them then you should have told me. I would talk to them.
[13:13] But it doesn't mean that you behave rudely with her and ask her to leave this house.
[13:19] I wont bear that at all.
[13:27] And in future, if you will have any problem then you will tell me.
[13:33] You wont misbehave with sister or mom.
[13:39] Please take care of this.
[15:46] I have decided mom, I can't live here now.
[15:52] Why are you giving so much importance to Falak's words?
[15:55] Mom she is right.
[16:00] Why am I living here and what is the reason for me to live here?
[16:05] While, I can live very comfortably in my own house.
[16:11] I can't tolerate Falak's rude behavior by staying here for the rest of my life.
[16:16] Today she slapped my delicate daughter. God knows what will she do in future?
[16:20] No my child don't say that. She wont say anything again. Hamza has scolded her in front of you.
[16:27] No mom.
[16:28] I have decided.
[16:31] Now you decide whether you will go with me or stay here?
[16:37] How can I decide? Don't worry, let's do something about this. Just relax.
[16:59] Do you know, you didn't deserve him.
What are you saying Falak?
[17:04] We have done everything for you and have given everything to you but you didn't deserve that Falak.
[17:14] I have loved you so much but you, you have given me this reward?
[18:05] Are you still angry with me?
[18:09] What difference does it make to you?
[18:11] Why doesn't it matter to me? You are my wife.
[18:18] OK tell me, why is your mood off?
[18:26] I want to bring Elham here in this house.
[18:31] What? But this is not possible Falak.
[18:37] Why isn't this possible?
[18:39] Elham is my daughter and you knew before our marriage that I have a daughter so why can't I bring her here?
[18:45] You can't bring her here because I am still fighting for you in this house.
[18:52] Mom and sister haven't yet accepted you in this house so how will they accept Elham?
[19:00] Are you missing her so much?
[19:10] Do you know Hamza, sometime I feel that something is missing inside me.
[19:16] She is part of my body and she is away from me.
[19:23] I feel pain and no body can have idea about that pain.
[19:33] She is my daughter
[19:36] and I can't meet her despite I want to meet her.
[19:39] Why can't you meet her?
[19:41] Kabir can't stop you to meet her and I don't have any objection on this as well.
[19:49] Kabir forcefully asked me to sign the Elham's custody papers.
[19:55] Such papers have no value. Court doesn't accept such papers.
[20:03] You can go with driver and meet Elham whenever you want.
[20:10] And by the way, why did you suddenly think about bringing Elham here?
[20:17] How lucky sister Nawal is.
[20:22] She has got everything very easily.
[20:29] She got companionship of Kabir and also took my daughter from me.
[20:34] I am burning from inside after seeing my daughter's attachment with them.
[20:42] I don't want my daughter to go away from me.
[20:46] I want to bring her here with me at any cost. I am her mother.
[20:57] And how can such people live a peaceful live who fill others' live with restlessness?
[21:04] My own daughter snatched everything from me.
[21:07] She snatched Kabir from me and tell me, what did she do to you?
[21:18] Sister Nawal did wrong to you and Kabir did wrong to me.
[21:24] I will go mad. I want my daughter back.
[21:29] And how stupid and helpless both of us are
[21:34] that neither you can say anything to Nawal nor I can say anything to Kabir.
[21:41] How helpless mother I am that I can't meet, see and take my daughter in my lap?
[22:06] You don't have to worry.
[22:09] I will find a solution to this problem.
[22:38] It is clearly mentioned in the custody papers which are with Kabir that I am handing over Elham's custody to him and I will not claim that again in future.
[22:47] Leave it to me.
[22:49] Falak has sent court notice
[22:52] to get Elham's custody.
[22:55] What?
[23:17] Why isn't this possible? Elham is my daughter
[23:20] and you knew before our marriage that I have a daughter so why can't I bring her here?
[23:27] Sometime I feel that something is missing inside me. She is part of my body.
[23:32] She is away from me. I feel pain and no one can have idea about that pain.
[23:38] She is my daughter but I can't meet her despite I want to meet her.
[23:48] My own sister snatched everything from me.
[23:51] She snatched Kabir from and tell me what did she do to you?
[24:08] Kabir forcefully asked me to sign Elham's custody papers.
[24:14] If I want, I can file a case against both of you for doing false propaganda against me.
[24:25] Hamza, consider this as my last warning.
[24:30] I wont warn you after today.
[24:54] Mom, you asked me to take over the business,
[24:58] now when I have decided to go back to Canada then why are you stopping me?
[25:03] My child, you can run business from here as well. It's not necessary that you go there.
[25:08] Mom I talked to Manager yesterday and he told me that due to unit's shut down all production process has been disturbed.
[25:16] And the clients have filed a case on our company.
[25:24] We will have to pay heavy penalties. The workers' moral is also down
[25:30] and if I wont go there then Company may shut down and we will face huge loss.
[25:40] And Raheel did hard work to bring Company to this stage.
[25:44] So do I let his hard work go in vain?
No, my child I don't want this at all.
[25:49] Raheel worked really hard. I am afraid that you will live alone there.
[25:54] Oh no mom. Trust me, I will live much better life there than I am living here.
[26:02] OK then, as you wish.
[26:18] Falak, do you want to bring your daughter here with you?
[26:26] What do you mean? What do you want to say?
[26:29] She is your daughter and you are very concerned for her?
[26:32] So do you want her to live here with you?
[26:35] That would be really great. I want my daughter Elham to stay with me.
[26:46] But Hamza, as you know that sister and aunt will never agree with this idea.
[26:54] That's my problem. I will look after that.
[27:04] It is clearly mentioned in the custody papers which are with Kabir that I am handing over Elham's custody to him and I will not claim that again in future.
[27:12] Leave that to me. I will handle this issue.
[27:18] I will bring Elham here to you.
[27:25] I don't believe it. Is this true Hamza?
[27:29] Yes, I will talk to lawyer today, he will file the case tomorrow.
[27:37] Falak it's your legal right.
[27:39] And neither Kabir nor anyone else can keep your daughter away from you.
[28:32] Hello, Mr. lawyer, where are you?
[28:37] Can you please come to office?
[28:40] I want to take your advise regarding an important matter.
[28:44] OK, I will be there within fifteen to twenty minutes so please come there.
[28:54] Whatever you have done to me, I will take revenge of that at any cost.
[29:03] Both of you have snatched my peace,
[29:07] now I will snatch peace from both of you.
[29:36] Sir, someone has given this outside.
[29:40] OK.
[30:11] What happened? What's written in this?
[30:19] Falak has sent a court notice to get Elham's custody.
[30:25] What?
[30:29] But how can she send custody notice
[30:33] since she gave custody to you and signed the custody papers as well.
[30:47] She has alleged me that I have done second marriage
[30:52] so her step mother means you
[31:00] can't take care of her so she wants to get Elham's custody back.
[31:04] What? She has lost her mind.
[31:09] How much she is attached with Elham, I know that very well.
[31:13] Elham kept crying all night but she kept sleeping peaceful in her room.
[31:19] If she was so attached with her then why had she left her like that?
[31:25] She didn't asked about her once.
[31:28] Why has she sent this notice?
[31:36] Kabir, we can't give custody of Elham to Falak.
[31:42] She can't take care of her. Do you remember what did she used to do?
[31:49] I remember everything. Each and everything.
[31:54] I haven't forgotten anything.
[31:57] Talk to lawyer and ask him to do something.
[32:00] She can't do this.
[33:01] What are the chances of winning our case?
[33:03] Truly speaking, our case is very weak.
[33:07] The custody papers signed by Miss Falak is the link which weakens our case.
[33:14] Anyway, I have sent the notice.
[33:18] Let's see, what will be the response.
[33:26] Kabir loves her daughter so much.
[33:29] He is very attached to her.
[33:33] I want to win this case at any cost.
[33:37] I want to see Kabir in a broken state.
[33:40] If you act according to my advises then I guarantee you that we can win this case.
[33:50] Don't worry, we will do whatever you will say.
[33:55] Ask Miss Falak to lie in the court
[33:57] that she didn't sign those papers on her will rather Kabir blackmailed her and forcefully asked her to sign the papers.
[34:53] I have to take care of her all the time and do her work all the time.
[34:56] I have my own life as well and I wanted to live my life according to my wishes.
[34:59] And by the way, she is not only my daughter, she is Kabir's daughter as well.
[35:02] So, he should take care of her.
[35:04] And if you can't take care of her as well then leave her there like I had left her there
[35:08] and if you can't do that then I will go myself to leave her there.
[35:23] Nawal, take care of Elham and try to make her like you.
[35:59] Nawal, why are you crying?
[36:04] How peacefully we were living and everything was going very nicely but..
[36:12] Kabir please promise me that we wont send Elham to Falak.
[36:17] What are you talking about Nawal?
[36:20] Elham is our daughter. I know very well about Falak's nature. 
[36:26] No matter what happens
[36:29]  I wont let Elham to go back to Falak. OK?
[36:36] Kabir, I don't know why but I am very scared.
[36:40]  What if court gives Elham's custody to Falak then?
[36:44] What will we do?
That wont happen.
[36:48] I am here with you. Right? Trust me. I wont let that happen.
[36:54] No matter what happens, I wont let Elham to go back to Falak. Trust me.
[37:38] Yes mom, you called me.
Sit, I want to talk to you.
[37:43] Yes, what's up?
[37:47] Your sister is going back to Canada. 
[37:50] She has booked her seat in tomorrow's flight.
[37:56] So suddenly? But why?
[37:58] Why? You are asking me?
[38:06] Your wife has build such a big and high wall between a brother and his sister, can't you see that?
[38:15] If sister is going back because of Falak then she has already apologized.
[38:22] She is really ashamed and I also advised her, she wont do that again.
[38:33] I don't think that these things matter at the moment Hamza.
[38:39] I have made my decision and my tickets have been issued.
[38:45] We only called you to tell you about this, Hamza.
[39:00] Sister please, don't go. You have as much right on this house as much I have.
[39:07] If this house belonged to me then she wouldn't say so much to me.
[39:27] Hamza.
[39:31] You have brought such a big torment in this house and put that on our heads.
