[01:08] Nasreen you come here
[01:11] Nasreen?
[01:14] Tell them
[01:15] Did you see her coming out my room yesterday? Didn't you?
[01:19] Did you see her ruining my dress?
[01:25] Why are you standing quietly? Tell them. Tell the truth
[01:30] I saw madam coming out of your room
[01:39] I didn't see her ruining your dress
[01:49] but you were saying it yesterday ..
[01:51] I don't know who ruined the dress
[01:54] have you heard?
[01:57] Have you? She only want to insult me. She doesn't want me to stay here
[02:07] Aaliya?
[02:11] What is happening in this house?
[02:15] The other day she tried to insult me and degrade me in front of you by telling a lie.
[02:21] If you want me to go from Kabeer's life then tell me, I'll leave
[02:26] But don't play these games with me
[02:32] Aaliya, I asked you something. Answer me
[02:37] I said what Nasreen told me
[02:40] O! Now you'll believe on servants and raise your finger on your family members
[02:48] I wasn't expecting this stupidity from you
[02:54] Falaq
[02:56] please calm down. I'm sure there must be some misunderstanding
[03:00] You leave it, brother. Kabeer, you drop me home
[03:03] I don't want to live here. You can keep your house. Drop me home. I don't want to stay here
[03:38] Falaq, what's this craziness? Leave it. Who leaves house on this small thing?
[03:46] Is it a small thing?
[03:47] She's blaming me by telling lies again and again. Is this a small thing for you?
[03:53] I got to know it now that I have no place in this house
[03:57] Sister Aliya insults me by blaming me wrongly whenever she wants
[04:01] There is some misconception. There is no need to exaggerate matters
[04:07] The day I have come into this house, my self respect is being crushed.
[04:10] You, brother Touqeer and sister Aliya are realizing me that I have no value
[04:16] I even apologized sister Aliya because you asked me.
[04:20] Its enough. Let me tell you, I'm not alone
[04:24] Falaq, its my mistake. I apologize.
[04:29] Forgive me. I shouldn't have believed a servant. I'm sorry. Please, forgive me
[04:40] Falaq, sister is apologizing
[04:47] It's okay sister. Now that you have realized your mistake, its enough for me
[04:54] Kabeer, drop me home
[04:56] Falaq, you won't go anywhere. Neither will I take you
[05:01] Please Falaq, please! Stop being angry. I did apologize.
[05:06] Again, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Its my fault. Please, don't go
[05:24] Wow Falaq, what a six. You well played and taught a good lesson to sister Aliya
[05:33] I have taken all my revenges. Next time, she'd be careful saying anything against you.
[05:54] Kabeer, there is no need to be worried. Don't think much about it
[06:01] Lets it go now. What's done is done
[06:07] Its something to be worried about.
[06:11] This has never happened before
[06:14] When you live together, these things happen. Forget it now
[06:22] I know sister very well. She would never make a lie
[06:29] We all are familiar with her nature.
[06:32] Kabeer, she's a human and humans do make mistakes
[06:39] Its isn't necessary that she's always right
[06:46] be thankful that problem is solved
[06:50] man, relax now. Fix your mood
[07:28] Look Aliya, whatever happened today
[07:33] It was wrong. It shouldn't have happened.
[07:36] You shouldn't have blamed Falaq for unreasonably.
[07:42] There was a big drama for no reason
[07:45] I asked Hafsa. She didn't ruin my dress.
[07:50] She is our daughter. She doesn't do these things
[07:56] Aliya, please try to understand. She's a little girl. Little children usually lie out of fear
[08:03] She doesn't lie. She's my daughter. I know her well
[08:09] Look all I know is,
[08:12] God forbid if Falaq had left home today,
[08:17] then our personal matters would have been discussed outside
[08:24] And Aliya, these little misconceptions can break strongest house too
[08:33] This is why I'm asking you to be careful as you are an elder
[08:40] That's all
[08:47] Fine! Now fix your mood. What's done is done
[09:25] Asjad, how are you?
[09:28] Fine!
[09:29] What are you doing these days?
[09:31] I have started a new IT company
[09:34] Again? What a man. A person is worried if he has to spend from his own pocket
[09:41] Excuse me!
[09:49] Do you know him?
[09:50] Yes, very well. We used to be together. He's a fraud
[09:57] He cheats on people. The time I left the company, his fraud case was going on.
[10:04] Really
[10:05] Yes! He started two companies and had to bear loss.
[10:10] Until greedy people are alive, fraud people can't die
[10:20] What are you saying? How can we sell house?
[10:25] We are helpless
[10:28] Azrat needs money badly
[10:32] If he needs money badly then what do we do? You refuse him directly
[10:36] How can we? If we'd refuse him, that means we are putting Nawal's proposal at stake
[10:44] I'm not favor of selling the house. And sister, what about your pride now?
[10:49] You wanted a partner who does everything on his own. So?
[10:57] Falaq I ..
[10:59] Try to understand the situation. Proposal can break
[11:03] Let it be. You wanted my opinion and I have given you
[11:10] You are selling this house for your daughter. I have no share in it because I'm not your real child
[11:27] What are you saying? Is this the time to say this all? I'm already too worried
[11:33] I'm also worried. I came here to discuss them.
[11:37] I thought its my home but there is no one of my own here
[11:41] Falaq, listen to me ..
[11:48] Why did you say this to her?
[11:50] You know her. I'll handle it
[11:54] I'd have to talk to her
[12:39] He's a fraud no. 1. He cheats on people.
[12:43] The time I left the company, his fraud case was going on.  He started two companies and had to bear loss.
[14:09] Hamza, what is your problem? Why are you calling me again and again?
[14:12] Nawal I want to say something important to you
[14:15] But I don't want to ..
[14:16] Its about Azrat
[14:19] Why aren't you understanding? He's a cheater and cheating on you. He isn't a good person
[14:24] Are you?
[14:28] Can I trust you?
[14:30] You don't know his reality
[14:33] But I do know your reality, Hamza
[14:35] But how do I explain it to you, Nawal? Why aren't you understanding?
[14:40] You are jumping in a well. Nawal, if you won't listen to me then I'll come to your house and ask auntie ..
[15:37] Where are you lost?
[15:42] I'm thinking, what if they refuse from this proposal in real?
[15:46] We have already invested a lot. What if they won't sell their house?
[15:52] I don't think so it will happen. Begum Sultana is a very respectful woman.
[15:57] She will think a hundred times before breaking a proposal
[15:59] You might be right. She is a dignified woman.
[16:04] But I'm stressing over something else right now. The house rent is a lot & your job is no more
[16:12] What should have I done? They were inquiring about me
[16:16] I had to resign forcefully.
[16:19] I would be in advantage if Nawal hadn't resigned
[16:23] but she resigned without even asking me
[16:29] You know they aren't as fool as we were thinking they were, especially Nawal
[16:39] Leave it, mother. As if we're going to marry into this family?
[16:43] Once the house if sold, we'll leave. Then they can keep finding us
[16:55] You?
[17:11] I couldn't even think that you'd be this disgusting
[17:15] Nawal, listen to me
[17:17] Is there anything else left after what I have heard?
[17:23] What's this nonsense Nawal?
[17:28] This is nothing after what you did. I want to kill him
[17:36] There must be some misconception. Someone lied about us
[17:42] We have heard everything
[17:44] and have seen too
[17:48] Your reality is revealed so there is no need of a drama
[17:56] What kind of a woman you are. You are insulting another woman besides being a woman?
[18:05] There is no need to talk to these people. They wouldn't have done this if they had realized it
[18:18] No, let me ask them. Why did they do this to us? What did we do to them?
[18:26] If she doesn't have a daughter, it doesn't mean that she does it to others.
[18:31] Don't you get tired of doing this?
[18:39] I wish you had a daughter then you would be scared of doing it to someone else's daughter
[18:53] Shame on you
[18:55] Come Nawal
[19:07] Lets go
[19:27] Already too much time is wasted. You know that I don't like to repeat
[19:34] Fine, I'll see. Thank you!
[19:39] Have this Kabeer
[19:41] Thank you!
[19:46] I wanted to say something to you
[19:49] Yes, go ahead
[19:51] Ask sister Aliya to stop doing these things
[19:55] I got quiet because of you today but next time I won't
[20:03] Look Falaq, whatever happened happened because of a misconception. Its over now
[20:11] It wasn't a small thing but a conspiracy.
[20:15] Thank God that the maid told the truth. What if she hadn't? Then you won't be believing me. No. you won't
[20:26] Then I would have to apologize for that I didn't do. This should end now. Will you talk to her or shall I?
[20:36] What is it? Why are you after it?
[20:40] Sister has already accepted her mistake.
[20:44] When someone accepts their mistakes, it means they won't repeat it again
[20:53] Falaq, listen to me. You won't talk about it to sister, neither will I. End it here
[21:07] Fine, if you say so. But what's the guarantee that it won't happen again?
[21:14] It won't
[21:17] Trust me
[21:22] Look Falaq, we all know that sister Aliya is good by nature.
[21:28] I don't know how did it happen.
[21:34] All I know is that she loves you and cares about you.
[21:40] Falaq, you too make your heart big. She takes care of us.
[21:46] Its our responsibility to ignore small mistakes
[21:57] Fix your mood. I can't go out with this mood
[22:09] That's like it. Take care, And stay in touch. Okay?
[22:17] Bye!
[22:37] I want to tell you something about Asjad
[22:59] There is no need to cry
[23:02] Be thankful to God that their reality came in front of us on right time
[23:08] I told you that I doubt their intentions but you didn't listen to me
[23:17] My child,
[23:20] how can someone know what's going on in others hearts
[23:29] Only God knows it
[23:37] My child, I was doing everything for you
[23:43] How do people forget that one day they'll die?
[23:46] How do they sleep peacefully by cheating and hurting others? Tell me?
[23:55] This is how the world is.
[24:02] No matter what, they don't fear from doing anything when it comes to their benefit
[24:08] I want to hand them both over to police.
[24:11] Then they won't dare to this to anyone else
[24:16] My child, we don't have to get into this
[24:25] God has safe us. Be thankful
[24:33] Call auntie Arfa and tell her about their reality
[24:38] I'll tell Arfa, you relax
[24:49] Come on, don't you worry
[25:06] Our game is over
[25:10] All the investment went into vain
[25:15] I think we should go and apologize to them
[25:19] Are you crazy? they both have found out everything.
[25:22] Thank God they didn't call the police. Now if we'll go to their place, they'll shoot us
[25:29] Mother, you aren't understanding. Nawal's future is bright.
[25:34] If not today, tomorrow she'll get a good job.
[25:38] We should take this chance and solve things with an apology
[25:44] Arfa called me. She said too much to me. She didn't only hit me,
[25:49] otherwise she has said everything. You still think an apology will solve this matter?
[25:57] No, I don't think so
[26:00] Whats wrong in going to them one time?
[26:04] Let me get married to Nawal once, then I'll handle her. I will ruin all her dignity
[26:27] I would be in advantage if Nawal hadn't resigned but she resigned without asking me.
[26:35] As if we're going to marry into this family? Once the house if sold, we'll leave. Then they can keep finding us
[26:48] Madam Nawal, madam is asking you to come and have dinner
[26:52] Ask her to have it. I'm not hungry
[26:55] Shall I bring you tea or coffee?
[26:59] I'll tell you if I'd need anything
[27:03] Okay!
[28:04] Stop!
[28:05] For whom are you taking it?
[28:07] sister Aliya isn't well. This is for her
[28:11] Give it to me, I'll take it
[28:12] You?
[28:13] Yes me. You go
[28:30] Sister? What happened to you?
[28:35] Nothing. I was feeling weak
[28:40] Why did you bring it? I asked Nasreen to bring it
[28:45] she was bringing it. But when I came to know about your health, I couldn't hold myself back
[28:52] I think you are over thinking about that dress matter
[28:57] It was my mistake. I doubted you. I shouldn't have. I'm too embarrassed.
[29:03] Greeting!
[29:06] Greetings!
[29:06] Greetings!
[29:08] Wow! Younger sister is serving you
[29:12] Sister wasn't feeling well so I asked the maid to make soup
[29:20] How are you sister?
[29:22] I'm fine. You tell? How was your day at office?
[29:27] It was good. Have a look at this file once you are okay.
[29:34] We are going to finalize an important deal. Soon it will be finalized
[29:41] God willing
[29:42] Leave this all, sister and have soup. You haven't eaten anything since morning.
[29:46] you'll feel more weak otherwise
[29:49] Do you know brother Touqeer, this is what I was saying to sister. Forget what happened.
[29:54] We have to live together so its better not to keep any hatred in our hearts.
[30:05] Sister, Falaq is right
[30:10] You change. I'll ask maid to serve dinner. Lets go Kabeer
[30:16] Sister, do have a look at file
[30:27] I hope that your doubts are clear now
[30:34] Aliya, clear your heart for Falaq
[30:37] She's a good person
[30:57] O wow! Is it ready?
[31:01] Thank you!
[31:08] Nawal?
[31:10] Where are you going?
[31:13] I applied for job. I'm going for interview
[31:22] Are you fine?
[31:26] Yes, I am
[31:30] I thought you aren't well. Wait for few days, then go
[31:37] What will happen after few days?
[31:42] You'll feel better and peaceful.
[31:47] I won't stop you from giving interview after that
[31:53] Don't you worry, I will be back after 1 hr
[31:58] If I'll stay at home, I'll keep over thinking
[32:06] It will help me getting over this condition
[32:14] I'm getting late. I'll leave now
[32:17] Bye!
[32:20] Careful
[32:34] Kabeer, do come back soon. We'll have dinner outside
[32:40] As you say
[32:44] I'll put reminder in my phone so that I don't forget
[32:46] Good
[32:51] I forgot phone inside
[32:53] You go, I'll bring it
[32:59] Hey, bring the key
[33:12] Falaq?
[33:15] Where is Kabeer?
[33:16] He went outside. I was going to him
[33:19] I had to give this file
[33:21] Give it to me. I'll give it to him. I was going to give him his phone
[33:25] It has some important documents. I thought to give it to him myself
[33:27] Don't you worry. I'll give it to him. You go and rest
[33:31] Okay fine!
[34:41] where were you Falaq? I was getting late
[34:43] Sister gave this file. She was saying its very important
[34:49] Thank God that sister Aliya remembered. I had forgot it.
[34:53] Its an important meeting today.
[34:57] Its a Canadian company who wants to open up their branches in Pakistan.
[35:01] If we are able to finalize this deal then we'll progress very fast.
[35:06] It will. What if it won't?
[35:10] Don't say that Falaq. I worked really hard for this project. I want this deal to be finalized
[35:20] It will. You still go through the file before meeting
[35:26] It was me who prepared the file. I gave it to sister Aliya to cross check it.
[35:33] Anyways, we'll meet in the evening. Take care
[35:35] bye!
[35:42] Yes sister?
[35:45] Yes I got the file. Have you checked the documents? Are they all fine? 
[35:53] Thank you so much
[36:27] Madam, sir Hamza is here. He wants to meet you
[36:33] Hamza?
[36:35] Why is he here?
[36:37] He is saying he wants to say something important
[36:41] Make him sit
[36:43] Okay!
[36:52] Have a seat sir
[37:46] Falaq?
[37:58] Do you want anything?
[38:00] I came to give you tea
[38:04] Thank you!
[38:05] Welcome
[38:28] Greetings auntie. How are you?
[38:31] Greetings! Sit
[38:34] Thank you!
[38:42] I know that you didn't like me coming here
[38:48] Its something that I have to tell you
[38:51] There is no need to be formal. Say what you want to say. I'm listening
[39:02] I want to tell you something about Asjad. 
[39:07] I called Nawal but she wasn't believing me
[39:11] About Asjad?
[39:14] What do you want to say?
[39:19] He isn't a right person
