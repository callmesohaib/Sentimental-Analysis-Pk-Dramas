[01:29] Please get well soon Touqeer. If something happens to you, I'll not be able to live.
[01:42] Please compose yourself. If you lose courage, I'll be scattered.
[01:49] I have a lot of courage and more than that I trust God.
[01:55] He'll never let my house scatter.
[02:02] Hafsa must be crying.
[02:05] Falak is with her. Don't worry she'll handle her.
[02:11] Please pray..
[02:13] Everything will be alright. Please come outside. Come.
[02:55] Yes Falak?
[02:59] What are you doing?
[03:00] Here. Nothing I'm giving old clothes to Zakia.
[03:05] Why are you giving away these clothes? You must have worn these only once twice.
[03:09] Yes but actually Hamza said so. I've shopped about ten times after I got engaged
[03:15] so he said I should give away all old clothes and wear only new.
[03:20] We've shopped so much and yet Hamza doesn't get tired. I do.
[03:26] You tell me why haven't you slept yet?
[03:28] I have no rest in my life. I just came back from the hospital.
[03:32] What happened? Is everything alright?
[03:33] brother Touqeer is in the hospital. He isn't well.
[03:38] Yes, what happened to him?
He had a minor attack but he's fine now.
[03:43] May God grant him health.
[03:44] You know I was so worried thinking about whether we'll be able to make it to Hamza's dinner party or not.
[03:52] We have a time of a week. He'll be better by then, don't worry.
[03:59] I want to show you something, wait.
[04:07] Here.. A minute.
[04:11] Here. See this. These are diamonds. Hamza brought these for me from Dubai.
[04:20] Its good.
Yes its good.
[04:24] Actually Hamza spoils me a lot, Falak.
[04:28] Alright, Nawal, I'm tired. We'll talk tomorrow. I'm sleeping.
[04:32] Okay. Alright, take care.
Bye.
[05:04] I'll get you something to eat.
[05:08] Please rest. You were in the hospital all night. I'll cook.
[05:13] Falak is right.
[05:14] Aaliya go and look into things yourself. Let Falak be
[05:18] and where is Hafsa?
[05:20] I gave her food. She's asleep.
[05:23] I want to rest. Please turn off the lights.
[05:31] Please go ahead, we have no objection.
[05:33] This is good. Nazish and her kids need their visas stamped and the kids have their exams next month.
[05:43] Maybe their might be a little delay.
[05:45] Alright. As you think better.
[05:48] Hamza and I wanted to get everything done quickly but she's his only sister
[05:53] and you know how many dreams sisters have for their brother's wedding.
[05:58] She couldn't come for the engagement and the wedding now is out of the question without her.
[06:01] Yes of course I understand.
[06:04] I've asked Nawal to start making preparations gradually.
[06:08] She will take about one and a half months to get everything done.
[06:11] And yet we'll have something to do on the last day.
[06:14] This is great. In fact I'll tell Hamza for the wedding dress,
[06:18] he should place an order for that. We'll get the work done.
[06:20] You're absolutely right.
[06:22] You should have brought Nawal along. The house lightens up when she's around.
[06:26] I would have brought her but since she has started a new job, she's busy.
[06:31] Its good. Its good that she works rather than being idle at home.
[06:36] Please have something.
[06:38] Of course. I'll do.
[06:43] Mr. Arif isn't here yet. He had to be here. I cannot see him around.
[06:49] Sir, I wanted to call and confirm but his number was off.
[06:53] Number is off?
[06:56] Are the cheques cleared?
Yes sir, they were cleared yesterday.
[07:01] Then what is the problem? He had a site visit with him and his number is never off. Oh well, you can leave.
[07:16] Hammad? We had a meeting with Mr. Arif.
[07:21] We're trying to call him but his number is off. Call him and find out.
[07:44] Yes tell me?
[07:49] He went to Dubai? All of a sudden.
[07:52] How is that possible? We had a meeting.
[07:59] What?
[08:01] When? What are you saying Hammad?
[08:05] You said they were very good people. Trustworthy.
[08:10] Hammad I paid him 50 million. He cleared his cheques yesterday.
[08:17] But you knew them well. Hammad what are you saying?
[08:24] I don't understand what to do now. Alright. Hangup.
[08:43] How can it be?
[08:47] How could I trust Hammad?
[08:55] May God give health to Toqueer.
[08:59] Has he ever had an attack before?
[09:02] No. Its the first time.
[09:06] I was so upset myself.
[09:09] We were talking and he had this pain.
[09:13] His color started turning pale.
[09:16] So what have the doctors said?
[09:19] Doctors are saying that he was stressed.
[09:24] Diseases today are like this. They make a person weak from the inside and we never know.
[09:31] You're right.
[09:37] And there are a few diseases that we get ourselves.
[09:41] He unknowingly make mistakes and then we have to suffer.
[09:48] Hello.
Hello. How are you dear?
[09:53] I'm fine. Excuse me.
[10:02] Alright, Aaliya, please allow us to leave.
[10:05] Oh no. Please eat before you leave. I'll get dinner started.
[10:09] No. We're not hungry. We came to ask after brother Toqueer. Take care of him.
[10:17] Take care of yourself as well.
I really appreciate you coming over. Thank you.
[10:20] May God give you strength.
[10:46] Kabeer, you haven't changed yet?
[10:50] Kabeer?
[10:57] What happened? Why do you look so worried?
Nothing.
[11:04] I'm not worried. You tell me.
No tell me. I've never seen you like this ever.
[11:21] Yes I had invested in a business.
[11:25] He turned out to be a fraud.
[11:30] What? He was your friend.
[11:38] The company was someone else's. My friend and I invested together.
[11:48] Oh.. Fraud.. How much money was it?
[12:00] 50 million?
Oh God.
[12:12] Falak.. Don't mention this to brother Toqueer.
[12:17] You know his condition.
[12:20] He will be uselessly worried.
[12:22] This isn't something to be hidden. He'll find one day or the other.
[12:27] We'll see about it then
[12:29] but right now don't mention anything to him. I don't want him to be worried because of me.
[13:12] Toqueer, what have you thought?
[13:17] About what?
[13:20] Will you tell Kabeer about Falak?
[13:24] He should know the truth.
[13:26] Whatever was happening in the house, Falak was responsible for it. Not me.
[13:33] Aaliya do you remember the last time Falak left home?
[13:37] Remember how Kabeer was.
[13:42] I'm scared that if I tell him the truth, he'll not be able to bear the truth.
[13:52] He is already worried because of me
[13:56] and frankly speaking, I don't want to worry him anymore.
[14:02] You know how much I love him. How dear he is for me.
[14:10] Aaliya I don't want to put him through a test that he has already appeared for. I'm sorry.
[14:20] But he'll find the truth one day or the other.
[14:25] What will you answer then?
[14:27] He will question. He will ask us why we didn't tell him when we knew the truth.
[14:34] What will you say then? Do you have any answer?
[14:38] Aaliya you have to understand this.
[14:45] Kabeer's married life will be destroyed.
[14:48] Falak is a liar and cheat. She wanted to destroy the peace of this house. She did so much to show me down.
[14:56] And now when you know her truth, you want to let it go?
[15:05] Kabeer, is very dear to us and because of that we know that he doesn't deserve a girl like Falak.
[15:15] Do you know,
[15:19] not calling out wrong as wrong is wrong too.
[15:30] Alright. If you don't want to tell, then don't.
[15:38] Where I've been insulted so much, we can see how it goes if we stay quiet. But remember this.
[15:47] Falak will never rectify her behavior. She'll make Kabeer's life hell.
[16:46] Kabeer.
[16:50] How do I look?
[17:01] Stunning.
[17:07] You didn't have this necklace before.
[17:11] Yes I got a new one. Is it beautiful?
[17:14] Falak, are you mad?
[17:19] This is a diamond necklace.
[17:21] You should have asked me before buying such an expensive necklace.
[17:24] Would you say yes if I had asked you? I liked it so I bought it.
[17:28] Obviously.
[17:30] Falak I told you about my business loss and I told you to be careful with the money in your account. I could need it in bad times.
[17:39] And yet you bought such an expensive necklace without asking me. Its the limit of stupidity.
[17:46] Kabeer can I not do anything as I like?
[17:50] Will I have to ask you for everything?
What is it if I bought something I liked?
[18:01] Falak, we'll talk about it later, once we're back.
[18:06] I'm not going anywhere Kabeer. You spoiled my mood.
[18:10] I cannot buy anything I like and you'll not get me anything I like.
[18:15] This isn't the life you showed me dreams about.
[18:18] Don't be so emotional. We're getting late. Lets go.
[18:22] I don't want to go anywhere. You can go.
[18:31] Okay. I'm sorry. I was very rude.
[18:39] They're waiting. Please come on. Lets go.
[18:53] Where are you? You're not here yet.
[18:56] See, they're already there.
[18:59] Lets go. They're waiting.
[20:12] Hello everyone. Meet my fiance, Nawal.
[20:24] My love, my soul mate.
[20:27] We've known each other since long. We studied in college together.
[20:33] But we drifted apart for a little while.
[21:24] Falak, why are you sitting here alone?
[21:27] I'm not feeling well, that's why.
[21:30] Come, lets talk to everyone. Meet people. You'll get bored sitting here.
[21:34] Please go ahead. I'm not coming right now.
[21:39] Nawal.. I want you to meet someone.
[21:43] Alright. Give me two minutes.
[21:46] Alright.
[22:13] Kabeer?
Excuse me.
[22:20] Yes?
[22:23] I want to go home.
[22:25] What happened Falak? So soon.
[22:28] If we leave the party, what will Hamza and Nawal think?
[22:30] I don't care what anybody thinks.
[22:33] I want to go home. Are you coming or should I leave?
Falak
[22:37] why are you creating a scene?
People are watching. Wait, we'll go in a while.
[22:45] Falak.. Falak.. What is your problem? Why are you creating a scene?
[22:52] Kabeer I'm not feeling well, really. I'm feeling dizzy. I cannot sit anymore.
[22:56] You stay if you like. Get me a cab. I'll go.
[23:05] Alright. Lets go.
[23:32] Nawal, what are you doing here?
[23:36] I cannot find Falak or Kabeer anywhere. I've tried calling but nobody is answering.
[23:41] They'll be here somewhere. I'll ask someone, they'll see.
[24:15] If you had to do all this, you shouldn't have gone there.
[24:18] It was so embarrassing for me Falak, leaving the party in the middle, in front of everyone.
[24:24] Kabeer didn't you see, I wasn't feeling well.
[24:28] Falak don't make excuses. You didn't want to go in the first place.
[24:33] If you think that is so, so be it.
[24:36] Falak, what will Hamza and Nawal think about us?
[24:43] It was so embarrassing. I cannot tell you how embarrassed I am after what you did.
[24:49] Exactly. You care about everyone except me.
[24:54] As it is Kabeer, I didn't ask you to come. You came yourself. Oh God, my head..
[25:05] New drama.
[25:31] Hello.
Hello. How was your dinner last night?
[25:36] It was good.
[25:39] Did Falak and Kabeer come?
[25:43] Yes they did come for a while but I don't know they left. They didn't even tell.
[25:50] You didn't even ask.
[25:51] I called Falak quite a few times but she didn't answer.
[25:55] Its surprising.
[25:57] She was behaving weirdly. She was sitting all alone. Please ask.
[26:03] Something must have happened between them.
[26:08] I'll ask. Don't worry. Have breakfast.
[26:13] Mom I'll be a little late. Hamza said we'll have a meeting with the designer for the bridal dress.
[26:20] All praise to the Lord.
[26:22] Alright, please call Falak and make her understand.
[26:26] I will. You have your breakfast.
[26:27] No. Just an apple.
Bye. Take care dear.
[27:49] Touqeer? Yes?
[27:52] Should I ask you something?
Ask.
[27:58] Did you talk to Kabeer about Falak?
No. Why?
[28:12] I think both of them have had an argument.
[28:16] Both of them were in a bad mood last night. I noticed.
[28:21] I thought you told Kabeer about Falak.
I didn't say anything else.
[28:28] By the way how did you know Falak isn't Sultana's own daughter but an adopted child?
[28:35] I went to a get together. Fariha, Sultana's sister in law was there too. I found out there but,
[28:44] what difference does it make? You don't want to tell Kabeer then why ask?
[28:48] Just like that.
[28:52] It won't take time for the ground below your feet to vanish
[28:56] if I tell your in laws that you're Sultana's adopted daughter.
[29:12] How did you know that Falak is Sultana's adopted daughter?
[29:17] I went to a get together where Sultana's sister in law, Fariha was there.
[29:27] Falak? What happened?
Kabeer..
[29:32] Falak? Falak? What happened?
I felt dizzy.
[29:39] Come. Come inside.
[29:48] What happened all of a sudden?
[29:51] Sit down.
[29:53] Why are you crying? What is it?
[29:58] I feel as if I'll die.
[30:01] What are you saying? Don't think about it. You're fine. In fact,
[30:07] you should rest, you'll be fine. Drink some water.
[30:20] Where are you going?
I'm calling the doctor.
[30:25] Please sit with me, I'll be alright.
[31:06] If Kabeer finds out your truth, what will happen to you Falak?
[31:17] Listen?
Yes?
[31:19] Where is Kabeer?
[31:20] He is in Aaliya's room. He was talking to Toqueer.
[31:25] What were they talking?
[31:27] I don't know. I went to give them water but I didn't pay attention.
[31:32] Get lost. Don't show me your face. What should I do?
[31:41] If Toqueer tells him about me.. What will happen to me? What should I do?
[31:52] Oh God..
[31:58] Kabeer? Where were you?
I was in Touqeer's room.
[32:04] Is everything alright?
Yes. All good.
[32:09] Kabeer, can you take me out somewhere? I feel suffocated here. Can we go?
Alright. Lets go.
[32:18] Is everything alright? What were you discussing with Touqeer?
Everything is alright. We were just discussing business, what else?
[32:26] You tell me, will you have ice cream?
Good idea.
[32:30] Then lets go.
[32:48] I'll have to do something. If Kabeer finds out, he'll stop respecting me.
[32:59] I will not let Aaliya destroy everything so easily.
[33:24] Its good that you took breakfast in Aaliya's room. Everybody's heart is clear now.
[33:31] I always want to live together. Maybe she has a misunderstanding.
[33:38] Its good. All misunderstandings have been cleared.
[33:43] I'm getting late for work. I'll drop you at your mother's.
[34:06] Aaliya, I wanted to talk to you.
[34:14] See, I'm getting late, I'll talk to you when I'm back from work.
[34:18] Are you upset with me?
[34:21] Why will I be upset?
[34:24] Then why aren't you talking to me? I've been noticing that you're ignoring me.
[34:30] I noticed in the morning as well. You and Touqeer avoided talking to me.
[34:40] Its nothing. You're mistaken.
[34:44] Aaliya, I'm ashamed at whatever I did.
[34:49] I did wrong with you. I have now realized.
[34:53]  God knows what I said to you. I was so ill mannered. I shouldn't have done it.
[35:02] Will you forgive me? You can punish me as you like. I've made a lot of mistakes.
[35:11] I don't know what I held against you. You're so nice. 
[35:17] You never complained to Kabeer against me.
[35:20] Neither you said anything to Toqueer. 
[35:24] You had a clean heart. I was a lowlife.
[35:32] Please forgive me, thinking of me as your younger sister.
Falak..
[35:38] You've realized your mistake. I'm happy.
[35:43] I have always thought of you as my younger sister. I've never hated you. 
[35:48] To be honest, whatever you said, hurt me.
[35:55] I know. That's why I'm apologizing that this will never happen again. 
[36:00] I hurt you. Please forgive me.
[36:05] God has changed your heart, its great. Do you know?
[36:12] Touqeer used to say that Falak would understand one day and I never believed him.
[36:21] But I was wrong. Touqeer is right.
[36:25]  God can give anybody a change of heart, anywhere, anytime.
[36:33] Did you forgive me?
[36:39] I should have understood from the very beginning. 
[36:42] We would have lived peacefully. Nothing would have happened.
[36:49] Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Love can change everything.
[37:28] Kabeer I'm sorry. I was so rude that night. You were right that,
[37:34] we shouldn't have left the event and come.
Its okay.
[37:43] Whenever you're free, tell me. I'll pick you.
[37:47] Are you not coming inside?
[37:50] No. I have an important work. Tell me whenever you're free, I'll be there.
[37:59] Sure.
[38:04] I am so happy that you thought about Nawal. 
[38:09] If God keeps everything alright, you'll be done with her responsibility with ease.
[38:14] Then you'll have no excuse that you cannot leave the house because of the girls.
[38:19]  I'll take you with me. We'll plan a world tour.
[38:26] Thank God, God is making me fulfill responsibilities for both my daughters.
[38:33] Now tell me, has Safdar transferred the amount?
[38:38] Yes, thank you so much. I've received the money.
[38:42] Let me know if you need more money. Don't hesitate. 
[38:46] I want Nawal's wedding to be a grand affair. She's like my daughter too.
[38:52] Yes of course.
Hello.
[38:55] Hello, my dear.
[39:02] What is she doing here?
[39:09] Its good that you met me here. I wanted to come to your house.
[39:28] She forgot her phone.
[39:33]  I'll have to go back.
[39:37] Falak, what is this way to talk to your aunt?
[39:42] Mom, I'm talking the way she deserves to be talked to.
[39:45] Falak what happened? Why are you angry?
[39:51] Weren't you ashamed of doing this even once? 
[39:56] Mom do you know who told Aaliya about my adoption?
[40:00] She did. The one who is standing in front of me.
[40:03] No Falak. You must be mistaken. Aunt didn't talk to Aaliya.
[40:08] I'm not mistaken.
[40:10]  I know everything. She told her. 
[40:12] I heard Aaliya telling Touqeer that I wasn't Sultana's blood daughter but an adopted child.
