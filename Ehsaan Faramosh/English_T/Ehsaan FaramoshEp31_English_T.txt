[01:01] Nawal? What happened? Has Hamza left?
[01:04] yes!
[01:19] Is this Mr. Kabeer's wife? Madam Falaq?
[01:22] Yes, she's the one. But since when has she started modeling?
[01:35] What did you say?
[01:37] Nothing sir ..
[01:58] Falaq, you are new hot topic in town
[02:01] I don't believe that we got such good response.
[02:04] 10 advertising agencies have called me since morning. They want to hire you
[02:11] Are you kidding?
[02:12] No! Not at all .. That's the truth. I'm not joking
[02:17] I don't believe it
[02:19] Believe it, Falaq. Didn't I tell you that I'd change your fate
[02:26] Do you know that people work hard for years for this position.
[02:30] And you became successful so soon.
[02:34] I understand, but do you know this is all your effort. You deserve all the credit
[02:40] Otherwise, I could never think of entering this field.
[02:43] That's right. But do not forget that I got this opportunity for you.
[02:50] Trust me, I'm not ungrateful. I'll always remember
[02:55] Falaq, take time out and come to office. Boss was saying that we'll handle all your adds.
[03:02] Shoes, payments, e.t.c.  I hope you have no issue?
[03:05] Not at all. Its a great thing. This way, I'd be stress less
[03:11] Then I'll get your contract ready
[03:15] Maria, I had a request. I don't want to work a lot. I'll do only selective work which is a good one.
[03:22] Of course. Even I know that. I don't want to effect your market value.
[03:29] Thank you! Bye
[03:57] Kabir, you are back from office? Is everything alright?
[04:01] have you lost your honor?
[04:03] What happened? I don't know anything
[04:05] You don't? If you don't know anything then what is this?
[04:10] What is this?
[04:15] Kabir, I wanted to surprise you. Did you see the shoot?
[04:21] Maria, just called and told me that a lot of companies want to sign me up, and hire me as a lead role. I'm very happy Kabir.
[04:33] No one in our family has ever tried to do this. How dare you to do it, Falaq?
[04:39] What has happened Kabir, It was just a photo shoot. What's wrong in it?
[04:43] Wrong? Whatever you did, you did it without my consent
[04:48] Falaq, decent families don't do these things
[04:52] What are you saying? Educated and decent girls are also working in this field.
[05:00] I thought you'd support me, Kabir
[05:02] No way. I will never support you.
[05:07] And the educated girls you are talking about aren't my wives. I have no relation with them. Enough Falaq. End this now
[05:16] You too end it, Kabir. You are always ..
[05:18] What is it? Why are you getting angry?
[05:22] Sister, look at him. The way Kabir is shouting at me.
[05:26] Kabir?
[05:27] I'm not shouting for no reason. Let me tell you why I'm angry
[05:34] Look at this. This is the reason I'm getting angry at
[05:41] Falaq?
[05:42] I can swear sister! I can't do this on my own.
[05:45] I asked Kabir before doing this all. And now he's acting as if he doesn't know anything
[05:51] What are you saying Falaq?
[05:53] I never knew that you are going to do this. I never permitted you.
[05:57] How can you say that Kabir? The other night at dinner, you said I can do anything I want.
[06:04] I told you that I get bored at home, and you asked me to find an activity
[06:09] After your permission, I got agreed for this photo shoot.
[06:12] Sister, no one gets this boost. How could I miss this big chance? Kabir, what has happened to you?
[06:22] Falaq, have you gone mad?
[06:26] Kabir, be quiet! Please be quiet, Kabir.
[06:30] Falaq?
[06:32] Falaq?
[06:35] Falaq? Are you alright? Falaq?
[06:39] Be quiet, Kabir!
[06:40] Falaq? Falaq? Falaq? Call doctor, sister.
[06:45] Yes, I am ..
[06:55] Doctor, isn't it something to worry about?
[06:57] It isn't. She fainted because of stress. She'll be conscious in sometime.
[07:03] I'm writing some medicines. Give them to her regularly and take care of her diet.
[07:10] Please do not say anything that will stress her out. Its not good to take stress in this condition.
[07:24] Thank you!
[07:27] I'll see you off. Noor, pick her bag. Come
[07:44] Falaq, thank God that you conscious.
[07:47] What happened to me?
[07:49] Nothing. You fainted suddenly
[07:54] There is no need to get up. Doctor said, that you need rest
[08:00] Kabir, I'm having a bad headache. Something is happening
[08:03] Keep lying. Doctor said that you should rest
[08:09] You take rest. I'll send soup for you
[08:14] Thank you sister!
[08:16] Kabir, you sit with me. I'll feel better
[08:32] Greetings sister!
[08:33] Greetings! What am I seeing? Pictures of our daughter in laws will be published on magazines now?
[08:41] What? What are you talking about sister?
[08:44] These are Falaq's pictures. She had a shoot for magazine
[08:49] Sister, I'm sure there must be a misconception. Falaq can't do this
[08:54] There isn't. I have magazine in my hands. This is her picture.
[08:59] I called Aliya. We also have daughters in our houses.
[09:07] No one has ever done this. Go and talk to her, and explain it to her. Why does she want to spoil our reputation?
[09:16] Okay! Right!
[10:07] Hello?
[10:08] Falaq, did you have a shoot for magazine?
[10:14] So you have watched it too.
[10:17] I feel I made the biggest mistake of my life by doing this photo shoot
[10:25] Leave it! No one cares about my feelings here
[10:31] What happened?
[10:32] Sister Aliya has brainwashed Kabir against me. He's upset now
[10:40] didn't you take permission from Kabir?
[10:42] I did. How could I take such step without her permission? Infact, he was so happy.
[10:53] Let me tell you something Falaq,
[10:56] pictures are amazing. You look wonderful. Just like a model
[11:04] Really? You liked them?
[11:07] Yes, a lot. You looked so pretty
[11:11] Thank you! Do you know the owner of the agency was telling me that a lot of companies want to hire me as a lead role
[11:20] But I can't do that. I did this just like that. I didn't know I'd be praised a lot
[11:27] I'm very happy for you.
[11:30] But Falaq, whatever you do, don't stress yourself. Okay?
[11:37] Yes, I won't. Tell me about mother? How is she?
[11:43] She's fine. She'd be very happy when I'll tell her.
[11:48] Do take care of yourself
[11:50] Yes, I will. Bye
[11:53] bye!
[12:07] Greetings auntie, How are you?
[12:09] Greetings! I'm fine. How are you?
[12:12] I'm fine. Where is Nawal?
[12:14] She's inside. Let me call her. You come inside
[12:17] I'm in rush. There is lots to do at home. I have brought few things for Nawal. Give them to her to check
[12:24] Look Nawal is here ..
[12:26] Nawal!
[12:29] Greetings! How are you?
[12:31] I'm fine.
[12:31] I'm fine
[12:32] When did you come?
[12:33] Just now. I'm going back now.
[12:35] Sit! I'll send tea
[12:37] Come, sit ..
[12:40] Nawal, you haven't visited since many days
[12:45] I'm very busy at office. I come back home and occupied with house chores. I didn't get time
[12:50] Hamza stays busy for the whole day, and you too. What's the matter?
[12:56] It wasn't the case earlier. Now what? You used to have lunch or dinner together
[13:03] I told you, I don't get time. How's auntie?
[13:08] Mother is fine too. I have got few things for you
[13:12] It wasn't needed sister
[13:14] I have got these things for you with love. Keep them. Its been late, I'll leave now.
[13:20] Have tea.
[13:22] some other day. You sit. I'll leave
[13:31] It was Saira sister calling. She was very angry.
[13:35] Kabir, I'm amazed that how could you give permission to Falaq to take this step?
[13:41] Brother I didn't. She misunderstood me. Sister, I only asked her to keep herself busy. I didn't ask her to do this
[13:53] If you didn't permit her, then how could she dare to do this?
[14:00] Tauqeer, why are you so hyper?
[14:02] I shouldn't? What are you saying?
[14:06] Its spread everywhere in the family. Because of Falaq, I'm feeling so embarrassed and can't face anyone
[14:16] what's done is done
[14:18] Now that Falaq has taken this step, we can't force her on gun point.
[14:23] We'll explain it to her with love. She'll understand
[14:25] Either you explain it to her with love or strictness, whichever way, but make it clear to her that we won't tolerate it next time
[14:38] She isn't well.
[14:40] Kabir talked to her in anger and she fainted.
[14:44] God forbidden is something happens, you'd regret your whole life.
[14:48] That's great. This is how she'll keep doing whatever she'd want.
[14:56] Explain this to her clearly that this won't be tolerated again. Understood?
[15:06] Yes, brother! I will explain it to her
[15:15] Look, talk to her politely. You don't have to be harsh
[15:58] Nawal, I think we should end this matter now
[16:03] I think sister and mother is feeling that something is going between us
[16:10] They both haven't said anything to me yet but I don't want them to find out anything, so please ..
[16:17] Tell me what have you decided?
[16:21] Its obvious that I would also want it to end
[16:26] Great, then you won't go on job from tomorrow so resign
[16:31] Hamza, I can't resign.
[16:33] The way your gut feeling is telling you that something is wrong mine is telling me that nothing is wrong.
[16:40] You try to understand and listen to me once
[16:47] Look, I'm sure that after meeting Mr. Sherazi, you'd find out that he's actually a good person, and this is all a misunderstanding.
[16:57] I'm sorry, I have no such plan.
[17:00] I stay away from my enemies, and do not have tea with them
[17:06] Anyways, its better we solve this matter before our wedding otherwise it will be difficult
[17:53] How are you now?
[17:58] I'm having a continuous headache
[18:14] Brother tauqeer was upset that why didn't I permit you
[18:23] Kabir, trust me, I just wanted to keep myself busy.
[18:28] Otherwise, I didn't have any wrong intention
[18:33] What's done is done.
[18:38] I'm sure now you won't do any such thing that would cause problem for you, me and our to be born child
[18:53] Are you understanding?
[18:56] You also make a promise that you won't yell at me
[19:04] When you talked to me like that, I started having anxiety.
[19:11] Yes, I had an idea. It won't happen again
[19:18] Sister Aliya was getting angry that I should have been more careful
[19:50] I don't want to drink.
[19:53] you have to even if you don't want to
[19:58] Fine, put it down. I'll have it after a while
[20:03] Not at all. Drink it in front of me. You aren't taking care of yourself. Infact, I'll feed you myself.
[20:10] Kabir!
[20:13] Come on, sit up. And have this
[20:24] I don't want to. Please, put it down
[20:27] You just had one sip. One more
[20:30] Kabir?
[20:32] A little more
[21:14] Come in
[21:17] Sir, Mr. Malik is asking for a high rate.
[21:22] I don't think so anyone would give him this much money
[21:26] Call him for meeting, I'll talk to him. No one else should get this land
[21:32] Okay sir, as you say
[21:47] Auntie called sister Aliya and asking her to send you. If you feel okay, do visit them
[21:57] I will once I'm better
[22:01] Do with the driver. Don't go alone. I'll ask the driver
[22:05] Kabir, why are you being over protective?
[22:08] I'm fine. Don't worry
[22:16] Its my duty to take of you. You can call it being over protective. Have your breakfast
[22:27] As you say
[22:29] Bye!
[22:30] Bye!
[22:50] I liked this land. We'll try to fulfill your demand
[22:55] I have lots of parties who are interested in this land.
[22:58] But I talked to you first. I have already informed you the rate
[23:04] Fine, my manager will talk to you
[23:07] Okay!
[23:08] See you. Thank you!
[23:09] You're welcome
[23:25] Javed? Javed?
[23:27] Yes madam?
[23:29] give me car keys
[23:30] Mr. Kabir asked me not to allow you to go anywhere alone
[23:36] Don't take Mr. Kabir's tension. Give me the key. I'll talk to him
[23:39] But madam, he'll get angry at me
[23:44] I told you that I will talk to him
[23:59] wow! You are here today
[24:03] Greetings!
[24:04] Greetings! I'm sorry, I was busy in a meeting this is why I'm late.
[24:08] Tell me what do you want? Tea or coffee?
[24:10] No, thank you so much!
[24:12] What will you have? You are here for the first time
[24:15] I'll have coffee then
[24:20] Bring 2 coffee
[24:24] Yes!
[24:24] You already know my purpose of coming here. We have already talked on call.
[24:29] We have talked to 2 other people regarding this project, but I want you to invest in Kabeer Food.
[24:40] You are interested in Food business
[24:44] We also want an investor who trusts us and doesn't backup. Otherwise, you already know us better
[24:54] I came to know that Hamza is also with you in this. He's also looking after your Dubai project?
[25:03] You are right. Hamza has 10% shares
[25:09] Fine! I'll invest whatever you'd say but I have a condition
[25:19] What is it?
[25:20] umm ..You'll give me 20% shares in the company
[25:29] 20%?
[25:30] These are a lot
[25:35] Why? you and Kabir already have 70% shares.
[25:41] If you'd give me 20% you would still have more than 50%
[25:48] I'll talk to Kabir, but I don't think so he's agree
[25:55] hmm .. fine then I'm fine with 15 % too. I can give you cheque even now
[26:04] Thank you so much. I'm really appreciate your trust.
[26:07] Let me discuss it with my team first then lets see what they say. We'll decide according to that
[26:18] As you wish
[26:24] Have coffee at least
[26:26] Some other day. I'm in rush right now
[26:31] I'll wait for your call
[26:32] Thank you!
[26:39] Falaq, I told you not to go alone.
[26:44] I had to go to mother. I couldn't take driver
[26:49] I'll come at night. What will he do there the whole day?
[26:54] Still, I'm worried about you. You aren't well
[26:58] I'm fine Kabir. You work in office without tension
[27:06] As if it works after you said
[27:10] Falaq please, don't do it next time. Okay?
[27:26] Hi Falaq, how are you? Good to see you
[27:30] thank you!
[27:31] Bring coffee for madam Falaq and bring the contract too
[27:38] Maria, there is a problem.
[27:42] I can't sign the new contract. Kabir isn't agreeing
[27:45] What? What are you saying?
[27:49] Don't you know the loss I'd bear if you won't sign the contract?
[27:52] I can understand
[27:54] But he doesn't like it. He doesn't want me to do this all
[28:05] Falaq, read it once
[28:08] This field has more money than you can imagine.
[28:12] Also, it has fame. Girls do a lot to achieve this all, and you are getting everything just like that
[28:23] Falaq, you aren't a slave. You are beautiful and educated.
[28:29] What is the need to be a slave to your husband the whole life?
[28:35] This is the age and time. Enjoy your life and live whichever way you want. Falaq, fly
[28:44] Look once you'll start getting money, you won't even need your husband.
[28:50] More than 10 agencies want to work and cast you.
[28:59] One shoot is in Dubai as well
[29:05] Dubai?
[29:06] Yes! 2 days in Dubai. You can enjoy a lot
[29:12] You can have time to think if you want but do remember you get these changes once. Once its gone, you can not have it back
[29:45] How are you auntie?
[29:46] I'm fine. Sit!
[29:50] Kabir, you and at our home? That's rare
[29:55] I'm mostly busy in work. I don't get chance
[29:59] Of-course, I understand. You don't usually visit. Is everything fine?
[30:05] I was passing by so I thought to pick Falaq too
[30:10] Falaq? She hasn't come here
[30:18] She isn't here?
[30:20] She told me that she's coming here. Infact, its been 4 hours now
[30:27] Let me call her. Where is she?
[30:38] Hello Kabir?
[30:40] Where are you?
[30:41] I told you, I'm at mother's house
[30:50] It doesn't seem like you are at home. There is noise in the background.
[30:55] Are you outside?
[30:57] Yes, I'm out at market with mother. I'll talk to you once I'm back home. Bye!
[31:33] Kabir, you and here?
[31:36] Where were you?
[31:39] I was with a friend of mine.
[31:44] Who?
[31:46] Maria. I was with Maria. She was insisting so I went to lunch with her.
[31:53] Which friend is this? I'm hearing her name for the first time
[32:02] Mother come on, you don't know the names of all my friends
[32:16] why are you all looking at me like this?
[32:20] Why did you lie if you were with a friend?
[32:29] What could I say? You and sister Aliya has put so many restrictions. 
[32:34] I can't go anywhere. I can't meet anyone. I can't even leave my room
[32:40] Now you tell me mother, I wanted to meet a friend and go outside. What was wrong in it?
[32:47] You wouldn't have let me if I had told you. This is why I lied
[32:54] Kabir, I didn't expect this from you. You have restrictions on Falaq?
[33:00] Auntie, I'm not this cruel. 
[33:03] If she wanted to meet her friend she could have told me
[33:08] Auntie, if I stop her, I stop her only for her health. I care about her
[33:17] There is a difference between putting restrictions and being careful. 
[33:21] I didn't give you my daughter for this reason. Look at her.
[33:28] If you are busy and can't take care of her, then leave her to us for some time. We'll take care of her
[33:36] What are you saying?
[33:38] Kabir, mother is right. You should keep her happy in this condition.
[33:45] Auntie, I do take care of her and keep her happy.
[33:51]  I have never put restrictions on her for no reason.
[33:53] I only ask her not to go anywhere alone. That is just because of her security and health
[34:00] Please explain it to her, she shouldn't at least lie to me
[34:05] Falaq, if you want to go anywhere, inform Kabir about it. Do not lie
[34:13] Why are you both standing now? Sit down. Ask the maid to bring something to eat
[34:18] I will
[34:19] No auntie! Please permit us to leave now. I have something important to do. 
[34:23] We'll come some other time
[34:26] Look my child, 
[34:28] a woman does get mood swings in such condition. You have no idea but Aliya does
[34:35] If she feels likes going out with friends, then let her go. One feels good by sitting with friends.
[34:46] Above all, husband and wife should give space to each other
[34:51] Right!
[34:54] Shall we go, Falaq?
[34:55] Lets go. Mother, I'll come again
[35:10] Come in
[35:12] Sir, you called me?
[35:15] Call Mr. Malik and ask him to come at 3 pm
[35:24] Why do you look so worried?
[35:27] Sir, I talked Mr. Malik, he has sold that land to Mr. Sheraazi
[35:34] Yes sir ..
[35:34] Mr. Malik took lots of payment
[35:39] But you said he's already asking more than a market price
[35:42] Yes sir, Mr. Sheraazi wants to ruin our every work
[35:55] fine you go
[35:57] Right sir
[36:07] Falaq come, lets have breakfast
[36:09] I dont want to. You go
[36:18] Is it your mood? It shouldn't be you but me
[36:24] Why not? You proofed me a liar in front of mother and sister Nawal. 
[36:28] What would they be thinking that I go out with telling lies? I felt disappointed
[36:34] I should have been disappointed
[36:36] Infact, I am. You said that I put restrictions on you unreasonably
[36:44] Isn't it?
[36:46] Falaq, if I ask you not to go alone then the reason is that I am worried about you
[36:52] I feel embarrassed. I think that you don't trust me
[36:58] Why wouldn't I? I trust you more than myself
[37:02] Then why are you bounding me?
[37:06] I'm not. I am only trying to explain you what's right or wrong for you
[37:14] You want to go out? Fine, go wherever you want. Just inform me
[37:28] Now fix your mood
[37:30] I can't go to office like this
[37:37] I'm fine
[37:39] Doesn't look like it
[37:41] Look at me. Smile
[37:48] Smile properly.
[37:51] I'm fine
[37:54] I'll drop you to your mother's house before going to office
[37:59] It isn't needed. I'll go with driver if I'd have to.
[38:04] Are you sure?
[38:08] Fine! Come downstairs then. Lets have breakfast
[38:11] you go. I'm coming
[38:12] Good!
[38:28] Hamza you?
[38:30] How are you Falaq?
[38:31] I'm good. How are wedding preparations going?
[38:35] Good!
[38:37] Are you here to meet Nawal?
[38:39] yes!
[38:41] She said you are upset because of her job? She told me that you want her to resign before wedding.
[38:51] What wrong in it
[38:53] Yes! I said same to her to listen to you. 
[38:59] She's going to be a wife of such a big businessman. It isn't appropriate to get humiliated for few pennies.
[39:08] She started saying to me to mind my business. 
[39:12] She's very emotional regarding her job. She won't listen to you
[39:19] Infact, she was saying that you are being unreasonable. She praises Mr. Sheerazi a lot. 
[39:28] She doesn't praise you this much as much she praises Mr. Sheraazi
[39:33] You can talk to her. I don't think so she'd resign. She is very stubborn. 
[39:39] She'll do what she wants
[39:42] I got you busy with all these talks. You must be thinking how talkative I am. 
[39:47] Its your personal matter. I'm sure you both would solve it once you'd sit down. 
[39:54] I'll leave now. It was good talking to you. Bye!
