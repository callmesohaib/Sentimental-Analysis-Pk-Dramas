[01:22] The ring is very beautiful. Nawal is very lucky.
[01:26] Her mother in law is very rich. They have everything.
[02:05] I got the jewelry made here but the diamond set, I lovingly brought from Canada.
[02:23] Falak, look at the ring. Isn't it beautiful? I think auntie chose it.
[02:27] She has a very good taste. She chose all my jewelry.
[02:51] What are you doing here?
I came to call you for tea.
[02:56] So you should have knocked before coming? Why did you have to come like thieves?
[03:01] I didn't knock because the door was open.
[03:08] Alright. Go. Get lost. I'll come.
[04:30] Nawal, mom's friends are waiting for you. Please come.
[04:34] I kept it here.
[04:36] What happened? What are you looking for?
[04:38] I cannot find my engagement ring. I kept it here.
[04:42] What do you mean? It must be here. Check properly.
[04:46] I kept it here and its not here now.
[04:49] If you kept it here, it should be here. It won't walk. It doesn't have feet.
[04:54] You never remember things. Check the drawer.
[05:05] What is it.. Its my engagement ring.
[05:12] Oh my god..
Where did you keep the jewelry boxes? Did you keep it in them?
[05:32] You know how expensive it was? It was diamond.
[05:35] What difference does it make if its expensive or not? It was special for me. Its my engagement ring.
[05:41] My friends kept waiting and left and you two are here talking.
[05:47] What happened?
[05:51] Nawal's engagement ring is lost?
[05:55] What do you mean engagement ring is lost?
[05:59] Mom I kept it there and now its not there.
[06:06] I told you so many times to take care of things Nawal but you never listen to me.
[06:12] That's what I'm saying. It wasn't something to be kept anywhere. It was her engagement ring. Its diamond. So expensive.
[06:19] My head is bursting thinking where it is..
[06:23] Do you know you kept it there?
[06:25] I'm certain, I kept it there.
[06:31] Oh God. My head hurts too. We've looked for it for long enough. You look for it now. I'm going down.
[06:38] Mom, I hadn't even fulfilled my wishes. I hadn't even looked at it.
[06:44] Please ask Zakia if she kept it somewhere.
[06:47] Help me find it please.
[06:49] My dear we'll find it. Don't worry, we'll find it. I'll ask Zakia right away.
[06:55] Alright. Stop crying my child. Zakia..
[07:21] Kabeer?
Yes?
[07:26] I know you're very upset because of me.
[07:32] In these past few days, whatever happened, it wasn't feasible at all.
[07:41] Who was right and who was wrong, I don't want to argue about it. I just want,
[07:49] remember one thing I'm saying.
[07:53] I love you like my dear brother.
[07:57] You're very dear to me like my own brother and I'll never want anything bad for you.
[08:02] I know this. You don't have to tell me this.
[08:11] Falak just came to this house.
[08:15] You know me since long. What do you think?
[08:20] Will I want anything bad for you or Toqueer?
[08:24] Or will I do anything to embarrass anybody in this house?
[08:30] Sister in law, Whatever is happening in the house, is because we have misunderstandings.
[08:34] Whoever knows you will never doubt your intentions.
[08:43] I am broken inside. Today, in front of you,
[08:50] there's not that bold and brave Aaliya, but an Aaliya who is broken. Who has lost.
[08:57] Sister in law..
[09:00] Whats wrong with you? What are you saying?
[09:05] I'm saying the right thing.
[09:09] Touqueer is very emotional, he won't understand. But you're my brother, you'll understand.
[09:21] I cannot fight such cheap thoughts and tactics..
Aaliya, where did you go?
[09:32] I became a little emotional. I'll go listen to Toqueer.
[10:19] Did you ask Zakia?
[10:21] I did. She said she didn't come in this room, she doesn't know.
[10:25] Her tone says she's telling the truth.
[10:28] Then what happened? Did the earth open up or the sky fall down? When I kept something at a place, how did it go anywhere else?
[10:36] It is something to worry about.
[10:40] What happened Nawal?
[10:43] You have made yourself a mess crying continuously. Can someone tell you got engaged today?
[10:49] Falak did you take my ring?
[10:53] What does this mean?
[10:59] I told you my husband got me so much jewelry. I have everything.
[11:04] Why would I do such a cheap thing?
[11:07] No, if you just hid it as a prank, tell me. I'm worried. What will I tell Hamza?
[11:16] Why do you have to tell him? How would he know?
[11:23] Don't tell Hamza yet. Give me some time, I'll look in the house. We'll find it if God wills.
[11:32] She's right. Why do you have to tell him? What will he think?
[11:37] You didn't care for something he gave you so lovingly. It was diamond.
[11:44] He might think you don't love him.
[11:50] You don't have to tell him. Who knows its in the house somewhere. You'll find it. I'm sure.
[12:03] Don't take stress. Everything will be alright.
[12:32] Hello?
[12:33] Where are you Nawal? I've been calling since long. You didn't answer my calls.
[12:37] Sorry, I was busy.
[12:40] You were crying? Is everything alright?
[12:43] No. I just got a little emotional. I was missing dad.
[12:50] You girls.. You get emotional every time.
[13:39] Oh wow. We have big people here.
How are you?
[13:43] I'm fine. How are you? Are you here to meet Nawal?
[13:48] Yes. Actually I'm here to take Nawal out for lunch.
[13:54] Alright.
[13:57] She's here.
[14:02] How are you dressed up? You should have worn a nice dress. You're going for lunch.
[14:07] And such light makeup. You're the limit.
[14:12] I look good.
[14:13] No. Actually Nawal is very simple. She doesn't know how to get ready. She cannot do anything.
[14:20] She doesn't know how to get ready. You should have called me. I would have done your makeup.
[14:25] Come, I'll do it now.
Actually,
[14:28] I think she's looking beautiful. I love this look of yours.
[14:42] Where's your engagement ring?
[14:47] Didn't she tell you? She lost her engagement ring?
[14:56] She kept it somewhere and forgot. We looked for it but couldn't find it.
[15:02] Actually, Nawal doesn't know how to take care of precious things. Who does that?
[15:07] Its the limit.
You lost it?
[15:11] But where?
[15:12] I kept it on the table and went to shower. When I came back, it wasn't there. I tried looking for it but..
[15:21] This is how she is. How leaves such precious things somewhere?
[15:26] It isn't done. It was her engagement ring.
[15:30] Had it been some ordinary ring, this would have been justified.
[15:34] Hamza, I'm so sorry. It was so precious. It was so close to my heart.
[15:40] I've been so worried and I couldn't sleep all night.
Its alright Nawal.
[15:45] Relax.
Stop it Nawal. Look at Hamza. He's so worried.
[15:51] Hamza you must be so angry. It is so.
[15:54] You know I took off my engagement ring and kept it safe. It was very close to my heart.
[15:59] I didn't want it to get lost so I kept it safe.
[16:04] Its okay Nawal. I'll get you another same one. I'll buy it for you.
[16:13] You must be angry.
[16:16] I can understand. The first symbol of your love and Nawal lost it. All of us are embarrassed.
[16:24] See, things aren't important. People are.
[16:35] Nawal is important for me. And she is with me.
[16:42] What if she lost the ring? She didn't do it deliberately.
[16:46] People make mistakes. I could too.
[16:50] You could make a mistake too.
[16:51] This doesn't mean we should reprimand someone for the mistake they make.
[17:01] Come on Nawal. We're getting late.
[17:46] You're leaving?
[17:48] I would have left with Kabeer but I stayed because you insisted.
[17:53] You're happy in your house, it has made me happy. I'm at peace.
[18:01] I'm not happy mom. I'm just living.
Ignore small things, dear.
[18:07] As it is, we should ignore such trivial matters. Everything will be alright in a little while.
[18:13] And love is something that makes a place for itself.
[18:19] Let it be mom. I don't need such advice. Its my house, I know how to handle it.
[18:23] Let Nawal come, then leave.
[18:27] No. She'll be late. They went for lunch. Mom, I shouldn't be saying this but still.
[18:36] They have been engaged for two days only and you allowed them to go for lunch.
[18:41] For me and Kabeer you we had to ask a thousand times to meet.
[18:46] See dear, Hamza requested me himself for lunch
[18:51] and I didn't have a reason to say no and secondly I myself wanted Nawal to go out with Hamza.
[19:00] Whatever misunderstandings had been between them should be cleared off
[19:03] so that they can have a good life once they're married.
[19:09] If only I had so much independence, I'd be happy in my house.
[19:16] I would have a good understanding with Kabeer.
[19:20] What are you saying? I have seen myself. Kabeer is always around you.
[19:26] He loves you very much. He respects you a lot.
[19:31] My child, they have given you all the blessings in life.
[19:34] Don't be ungrateful. Be thankful to God.
[19:38] Alright, don't lecture me. I'm leaving. Say hello to Nawal once she's back.
[19:42] Alright.
Bye.
[19:44] Be happy.
[20:04] Mam, your tea.
Keep it there.
[20:23] Alright so you can do this as well.
[20:27] How was your function? Did everything go fine?
Of course.
[20:32] I was there, I got everything done myself. How would anything go wrong?
[20:38] Kabeer told me that Nawal managed everything very well.
[20:44] By the way, you have this bad habit of claiming things done by others.
[20:50] You've understood me well.
[20:52] Yes. I know you well and gradually everyone else will too.
[21:05] Alright. You believe this?
[21:11] I'm ready to forget everything you did in the past and move ahead with you. But Falak I want,
[21:22] you should refrain from your antics. Stop doing things to destroy the peace of our house.
[21:39] What antics? What are you talking about?
[21:43] You know very well what I'm talking about.
[21:47] If I tell your truth to Kabeer, you know what would happen.
[21:53] Maybe he'll leave you.
[21:57] Are you scaring me?
[21:59] I'm not scaring you. I'm trying to make you understand.
[22:04] I'll not tell anyone, anything.
[22:08] I will not destroy your house and you'll not destroy the peace of our house.
[22:15] Alright. I'll do as you say. I'll not destroy the peace of this house but I too have a condition.
[22:25] What condition?
[22:28] You'll ask Kabeer to shift into a new house with me.
[22:36] He will never listen to me but if you say, he'll not put it off. So if you want to maintain peace in the house,
[22:45] then make Kabeer agree to live separately.
[22:49] What is your problem here? When you have everything here, what else do you want?
[22:55] You're my problem.
[23:01] I don't like you in front of me at all.
[23:08] So alright then. Ask Kabeer to live separately with me because we cannot live together in this house.
[23:18] If you want the peace of this house, accept what I'm saying.
[23:25] Or else you'll see what I can do.
[24:36] Things aren't important. People are. Nawal is important for me.
[24:44] What if she lost the ring? she didn't do it deliberately. People make mistakes. You or I could do it.
[24:52] This doesn't mean we should bad mouth people if they make a mistake.
[25:07] Kabeer should I ask you something?
Yes?
[25:13] If I had lost my engagement ring on the next day of the engagement. How would you react?
[25:20] What sort of a question is this?
Tell me.
[25:27] What should I tell you? Maybe I would be upset with you. I could have said anything in anger.
[25:35] Like you should have been careful or how did you lost the ring. Etc.
[25:41] How many men would be out there who'd tell their fiance to not to worry if they lost their rings and that they'd get them a better one.
[25:55] Things don't mean more than people.
[26:00] What is going on in your mind right now? What nonsense are you thinking?
[26:07] Tell me how many men must be there?
[26:10] Not one, Falak. See, losing your engagement ring isn't a small thing.
[26:18] Every men would react. If not today but tomorrow perhaps. He will definitely react.
[26:29] There are a few. Different.
[26:37] I don't understand what you're trying to say.
[26:42] Nothing Kabeer. Do your work. Use your mobile.
[27:11] Yes Falak, tell me.
[27:12] Thank God you answered Nawal. Where were you? Why weren't you answering?
[27:18] I was getting ready.
[27:21] For what?
[27:22] I'm going to meet Sofia aunty. She wanted to introduce me to some guests.
[27:29] You're the limit. She called you once and you'll go immediately.
[27:33] You should have shown a bit of attitude and tell her you were busy.
[27:39] Falak you know I'm not habitual of doing this and neither do I like all this.
[27:45] You're weird.
[27:47] I don't understand you. If you give them so much protocol right now, they'll treat you next to dust once you get married.
[27:54] Do you understand?
[27:56] Look at Kabeer and his family. What have they done to me?
[28:00] I gave them a lot of respect and now I'm suffering.
[28:04] Ask them to accept whatever you want and they'll know its not their way.
[28:09] It doesn't look good Falak.
[28:12] Had I said no, it would have been different. Hamza is coming to pick me now.
[28:17] Its not important that everybody is like your in laws.
[28:23] There are some people who're good and loving.
[28:26] Alright don't taunt me. I was just telling you for your own good.
[28:45] Nasreen.. Nasreen..
[28:51] Who are you?
[28:52] My name is Noor.
I've fired Nasreen
[28:57] You have fired her?
[28:59] Yes. I hired Noor in her place. Tell her whatever you need done. She'll do it fast.
[29:06] Who did you ask before firing her?
[29:08] This is my house. Nasreen changed her loyalty,
[29:13] I threw her out. Why do I have ask anyone?
[29:17] You're forgetting that Toqueer gave me the responsibility of the house.
[29:22] Without my permission, how could you do it?
[29:25] Toqueer gave you the responsibility of the house but he didn't ask me to get your permission for everything.
[29:32] I can make my own decisions.
[29:35] And I will do whatever I can do for the best interest of this house.
[29:38] And you focus on the rest of your responsibilities. For instance this kitchen.
[29:45] First of all, decide the menu for today.
[29:49] Its quite late. The food should be ready by now. And this,
[29:53] these are a few utility bills, you'll have to stay updated about them.
[29:59] The salary for the employs and everything.
[30:02] There are a lot of things. Its a long list. You'll have to do everything in these two days.
[30:09] Houses don't run itself. You have to burn blood and sweat. Oh well,
[30:16] I know my responsibilities so I made a list for you.
[30:22] It'll help you out and I hope everything will be done on time.
[30:27] I shouldn't be telling this to you again.
[30:32] Yes. I came to tell you that the garden wasn't cleaned today so get that done as well.
[30:45] Why are you looking at my face? Do your work.
[30:56] I threw Nasreen out. She changed her loyalty so I threw her out. Why should I ask someone about it?
[31:05] Touqeer gave you the responsibility of the house but he didn't bound me to your permission.
[31:11] I can make my decisions myself.
[31:17] Its a long list and you'll have to do everything in these two days.
[31:23] And yes, I came to tell you that the garden isn't cleaned either. Get it done.
[31:30] What does she think that I'm her servant that I'll do everything?
[31:34] I shouldn't have taken the responsibility of the house.
[31:42] Whatever it is, I need to live separately with Kabeer but whatever it takes,
[31:45] I'll not let Aaliya live peacefully. I'll destroy her.
[32:04] So dinner is ready. It smells delicious.
[32:14] Aaliya didn't come?
She isn't feeling well so she is in her room.
[32:18] What happened to her? Nobody told me.
[32:23] I think I'll take her food to her room.
Yes, this would be fine.
[32:27] No. Let it be. Tell the maid, why do you have to?
[32:30] I didn't know she was sick. Had I known I'd have cooked something else for her.
[32:37] But I'll go and give this to her now. You should start.
[32:41] Why do you have to?
Its alright. She'll serve. Please start.
[32:55] Aaliya, how are you now?
[32:59] Why did you bring food for me here?
[33:04] I needed a chance to take revenge for my insult.
[33:09] What do you mean? What chance? What insult?
[33:13] You're very simple. You didn't understand me yet. You wanted to show me down.
[33:21] I mixed poison in this food and once you die after eating this, I'll be the queen of the house.
[33:29] What are you trying to say?
[33:32] Oh. You know now. You'll not eat this food now.
[33:38] What are you doing now?
[33:50] Have you lost your mind? What are you doing now?
[33:59] What did you do? I brought you food. If you didn't want to eat, you should have told me.
[34:06] Aaliya, what is this?
[34:08] I didn't do this. She threw it herself. She's lying.
[34:13] Have some fear of God. Why are you saying this? 
[34:17] Kabeer I've never seen someone disrespect food so much. Kabeer she pushed me and threw this food.
[34:24] Falak, relax. We'll have this cleaned.
[34:27] Kabeer she threw soup on my foot. Its burning.
[34:32] You come with me. We'll put some ointment on it.
[34:38] Touqeer listen to me.
[34:40] What is this? You're an educated woman and I didn't expect this from you.
[34:45] She brought you food so lovingly. What is the fault of that poor girl?
[34:50] She isn't a poor girl Touqeer. She isn't.
[34:53] She isn't as innocent as she looks.
Enough.
[35:00] Noor.
[35:16] Why did Aaliya do this to me? Why does she hate me so much?
[35:20] Is it hurting you? Should I take you to the doctor?
[35:25] Its alright but its burning a lot.
I've put cream on it, it'll get better in a while.
[35:32] Kabeer, I'm scared now. I cannot live here anymore.
[35:38] She threw hot soup on me. She might kill me tomorrow, what do we expect from her?
[35:45] I cannot live here anymore. Go somewhere from here.
[35:48] I'll talk to Toqueer.
[35:52] They have been trying to make her understand but has it made a difference.
[35:56]  It didn't make a difference yesterday, it won't make a difference now.
[36:00] You don't care about me Kabeer.
[36:02] Why don't I care for you Kabeer? You're a part of my life.
[36:09] Your pain is my pain.
[36:11] Then why don't you care about my pain? Why don't you understand?
[36:16] The hatred I saw in her eyes, I was scared. Talk to Aaliya yourself. What does she want?
[36:28] Falak, I apologize for what Aaliya did.
[36:33] Why are you apologizing? She should be the one apologizing.
[36:36] Tell him now. What nonsense were you saying?
For God's sake be quiet.
[36:41] I am not lying. She is the one who threw the tray.
[36:44]  She said she has poisoned my food and she wants to kill me.
[36:48] What?
[36:51] Kabeer she how she's lying. Why would I do that? Why would I poison her food?
[36:58] She is accusing me again. What benefit will I get killing you?
[37:03] Because you want to own the house.
[37:06] You want to live separately with Kabeer. Isn't this your plan?
Oh God..
[37:10] I don't believe this is how you return my love.
[37:15]  I took you as my elder sister, did so good to you and this is how you return it.
[37:19] Kabeer why would I do this? Tell her. Why didn't I die before all this?
[37:27] Aaliya come along.
I'm not wrong. Trust me. I'm not lying.
[37:34] Time will tell I was right, if God wills.
[37:38] This girl is the termite that's eating the roots of this house from the foundations. 
[37:43] You'll only understand when everything shatters.
Aaliya..
[37:48] I don't want to live here. I cannot live here. I'll turn mad.
[37:55] Falak get a grip on yourself.
[37:57] My head is hurting Kabeer. I cannot breathe.
I'll get water.. Oh..
[38:05] Brother.. Falak..
[38:38] Kabeer..
Falak are you alright?
[38:42] Yes what happened to me?
Relax you're alright.
[38:46] Kabeer I had a bad dream. I saw you were leaving me.
[38:50] Falak what are you saying?
[38:52] I will not leave you. I'll always be with you.
[38:55] Thank God you're awake Falak. The doctor is here as well.
[38:59] I'm fine. Nothing is wrong with me.
[39:02] Falak, worry about yourself as well. The doctor is here. Get yourself checked, we'll be satisfied.
[39:08] No Kabeer. Go and check on Aaliya. She isn't well. She was stressed.
[39:13] Aaliya is alright.
[39:16] Doctor, please check. Please
[39:28] Tell Kabeer to get me a new house because we cannot live together.
[39:33]  If you want peace in the house, listen to me.
[39:38] Otherwise you'll see what I can do.
[39:44] You're very simple. You haven't understood me yet.
[39:47]  You wanted to show me down. I poisoned your food.
[39:51] You'll die after eating this so I'll rule the house peacefully.
[40:00] Oh, now you know and you won't eat it.
