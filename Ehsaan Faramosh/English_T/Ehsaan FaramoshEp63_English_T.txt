[01:02] What happened Hamza?
[01:04] Who shouldn't be caught by the police? Who were you talking to?
[01:11] Nothing. There was an issue in the office. I was discussing that.
[01:20] Alright. Tell me. I've never seen you so angry ever before.
[01:24] What useless things are you asking? I'm telling you its an issue in the office.
[01:28] Even if I tell you, what difference would it make?
[01:31] You know very well, I'm already stressed.
[01:37] By the way, where did you go?
[01:40] Do you know what happened with me? I went to meet Ilham.
[01:43] Kabeer and Nawal treated me so badly. They didn't let me meet my daughter.
[01:48] And Kabeer dared throw me out of the house and told me never to come back.
[01:55] They've snatched my daughter from me and now he threatened me
[01:59] that the court will rule in his favor. This cannot be.
[02:03] I will not let this happen Hamza. Call the lawyer right now and ask him to get a date for next week.
[02:09] I want to win this case anyhow. I need my daughter back.
[02:12] After the incident their case is week. The court will not decide in their favor.
[02:22] Once I have my daughter back, I'll never let these two see her face for the rest of my life.
[02:36] Hamza.. I'm saying something to you. Are you listening?
[02:39] No Falak. I'm not listening. I told you I'm already worried. Don't bother me anymore.
[02:49] Hamza, whats wrong with you? Why are you talking to me in this tone? What did I do?
[02:52] How else should I talk to you? You don't understand what I'm saying.
[02:56] You're only worried about your daughter, Ilham.. all the time.
[02:59] Your daughter has become a punishment for me.
[03:08] Everything around me is crumbling because of your daughter.
[03:11] If you take her name in front of me after today, it won't be good.
[03:19] You wanted to bring her to me. You wanted her to stay with me.
[03:26] No I don't want it. Why would I?
[03:31] She isn't my daughter. She's your daughter. What relationship do I have with her?
[03:36] But I'm your wife.
[03:38] Do you even realize how much pain I'm in?
My daughter is away from me. I'm in so much pain.
[03:50] How can you say all this?
[03:52] I know everything. I certainly know how much you love your daughter and how much you care for her?!
[04:02] Listen, don't put up this charade in front of me. Understood?
[04:18] Do you want your daughter to come to you?
[04:20] The documents that Kabeer have, clearly state that I've denounced Ilham's custody and I cannot claim again.
[04:27] Leave that to me. I'll go to the lawyer. I'll bring Ilham to you.
[04:35] Neither Kabeer nor anybody else can take your daughter away from you.
[04:50] Sir why don't you understand,
[04:52] the people who kidnapped my daughter are roaming about on the streets and you don't want me to worry?
[04:58] If that woman is caught who kidnapped my daughter, then go and arrest her husband.
[05:02] Investigate from him. He'll tell you everything.
[05:07] See sir, please catch him anyhow. I'll not be at peace until he's arrested.
[05:13] Today it was my daughter, tomorrow he can just kidnap anybody else's daughter.
[05:19] I want that man behind bars at all costs.
[05:23] Please do something about it. Thank you.
[05:30] They take everything easily.
[05:34] Nawal, why are you so worried?
[05:41] Shouldn't I be worried?
[05:47] Did you hear Falak, how she threatened us? She can do anything. I'm afraid.
[05:54] Kabeer if the court really gives her Ilham's custody, what will we do?
[06:00] Please compose yourself. Relax.
[06:03] You don't have to worry. I'm with you.
[06:09] Don't worry because I'm with you.
[06:12] You talked to the DSP. Tell me what is he saying?
[06:17] He said they'll catch him very soon. They're close to him
[06:22] Kabeer we don't know how many people are involved in this? Who are they and what can they do?
[06:29] We should be thankful that we have our daughter back.
[06:32] Lets leave everything on God now. The police would know best. Please don't get involved in it.
[06:37] Nawal what are you saying?
[06:39] So what else can I say? We're being tested one after another.
[06:43] God forbid if something happens to you, what will we do?
[06:48] Nothing will happen to me.
[06:53] Nawal until the people, who harmed my daughter, aren't caught, I'll not be at peace.
[07:03] I will take them to their consequences.
[07:09] Nawal, our daughter's life was being gambled upon
[07:13] and now I'll not let anybody else's daughter suffer.
[07:57] What right are you talking about Falak?
[07:59] You let go off all your rights yourself. Nobody forced you.
[08:06] Have you forgotten everything?
[08:13] You cannot take her along until the court decides.
[08:16] Do whatever you want to do in the court.
[08:22] You're only worried about your daughter. All the time, you chant, Ilham.
[08:26] Everything of mine is being destroyed because of your daughter.
[08:30] If you take her name again, it won't be good.
[08:34] You wanted to bring her to me yourself. You wanted her to stay with me.
[08:38] I don't want it. Why would I? She's not mine but your daughter!
[09:13] Mam, your friend Anum is here to see you.
[09:18] Anum is here?
[09:19] Yes.
Alright. Make her sit. I'll just come.
[09:23] Okay.
[09:45] Hey.. What a pleasant surprise! How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
[09:50] I'm fine. Please sit..
Thank you so much.
[09:53] You know, I wanted to meet you since so many days but I couldn't come.
[10:00] I was missing you too. I thought I'd come see you when I'd be free.
[10:04] Enough. Had you missed me, you'd have at least called but no.
[10:09] Madam doesn't even have 10 minutes.
[10:12] You could have at least called. See I wanted to meet you, I came.
[10:18] You know I was so worried.
[10:21] First the kidnapping, I was absolutely senseless.
[10:25] I was worried dead about Ilham. And now Hamza. God knows whats wrong with him?
[10:34] Why? What happened? What is it?
[10:38] I don't know. He reacts weirdly. He's rude about everything.
[10:43] I think he isn't the same man I knew.
[10:48] I destroyed my whole life behind that guy. Just to make him mine.
[10:54] Should I tell you something? You and Hamza are both alike.
[10:59] Selfish. Indifferent. Do you know he's the same Hamza you did so much to get?
[11:06] You did so many plannings. You created misunderstandings between Nawal and Hamza.
[11:14] Then you accused Kabeer and Nawal falsely when they didn't have any affair.
[11:27] Our Falak thought that someone is who rich and has all the luxuries in the world,
[11:33] he is the happiest. Isn't it?
[11:39] You enraged Kabeer and took a divorce from him so that you could marry Hamza.
[11:47] Then you blamed everything on Nawal.
[11:56] I don't understand, why I'm discussing all this with you?
[12:01] It won't make a difference to you.
[12:04] that's why I can only make you understand. I cannot do anything else.
[12:09] Listen to whatever Hamza says.
[12:14] Hamza.. You?!
[12:28] Hamza you? When did you come?
[13:17] Everybody was right about you but I didn't believe them.
[13:24] Why did you do this to me?
[13:28] I loved Nawal..
[13:30] You know how many years I waited for her.
[13:34] You destroyed everything.
[13:36] What...
Why did you do this? Answer me. Why did you do this?
[13:41] Hamza whats wrong with you? What are you saying? I don't understand anything.
[13:45] I heard everything with my own ears Falak.
[13:49] You turned me against Nawal.
[13:52] God knows what you fed me and I used to argue with her.
[13:58] I was such an idiot that I believed you.
[14:02] Anum was talking about something else. You've misunderstood. Nothing like that happened.
[14:13] Hamza.. I loved you Hamza..
[14:16] Shut up. You fell in love with me? You're lying!
[14:24] You did everything for money. You wanted my name. You wanted my status.
[14:41] You turned me against Nawal.
[14:44] You made me hate her.
[14:47] If you wanted money, you should have told me. I'd have given them to you.
[14:50] I didn't want anything Hamza. I just wanted you..
Stop with your nonsense...
[15:02] You know how many years I lived without her?
[15:06] You snatched away my love, my happiness. You destroyed everything..
[15:16] I'll not forgive you..
[15:19] Hamza what happened? Why are you so upset?
[15:23] Everything is destroyed mom. You were right. Nazish was right. She trapped me.
[15:38] She turned me against Nawal.
[15:40] God knows what she fed me against her and I was such an idiot that I believed her.
[15:50] She took Nawal away from me, mom..
[15:56] She didn't even care for her sister who loved her. Who took care of her..
[16:02] You're a selfish.. and ungrateful girl..
[16:06] Hamza please I made a mistake. Hamza please..
[16:09] Mom tell her to get lost from my sight or else I'll kill her.
[16:14] Get lost! Go!
[16:19] Falak, go to your room.
[16:47] Hamza..
[16:56] Hamza.. please compose yourself.
[17:04] How can I compose myself?
[17:07] I've lost everything. How did I believe what she said?
[17:17] Nawal tried to make me understand.
[17:21] She came to make me believe what she said but I didn't believe her.
[17:28] Had I listened to her, she would have been with me, today.
[17:34] Didn't I tell you, Nawal wasn't that type of a girl who could deceive you.
[17:41] But what could we do? At that time,
[17:43] You were not ready to believe anyone. We couldn't help it.
[17:50] You're right. I should have believed you.
[18:00] This girl was never right for you. She played one game after another. See,
[18:09] the person that doesn't belong to his own family
[18:14] he cannot be anybody's. She was never mother's.
[18:23] Its because of these things that you understand a person's intentions.
[18:28] I've never discussed such things with you,
[18:33] but I tried to make you understand after what she did. But now you know..
[18:43] Don't worry, everything will be alright. I'm with you. You're not alone.
[20:07] You turned me against Nawal and made me hate her.
[20:12] If you wanted money, you should have told me, I'd have given you.
[20:16] I didn't want anything Hamza.. I just wanted you..
[20:19] Stop with your nonsense. Do you know how many years I lived without her?
[20:25] You snatched my love from me. You took away my happiness. You destroyed everything.
[21:08] One sided love only hurts you, you get nothing.
[21:13] I'd say you should stay here and show Nawal how happy you are in your life.
[21:19] She should realize what she has lost.
[21:28] Falak isn't a good girl. Someone who isn't sincere with her daughter,
[21:33] how could she be sincere with you? Nawal is hundred times better than Falak.
[21:42] Hamza, Nawal isn't home yet. I think she's at Kabeer's house.
[21:48] Weren't you even a little bit ashamed to have an affair with your ex-wife's sister?
[21:52] Enough Hamza! If you say another word. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
[21:58] You must be mistaken. Its not as you think. I brought Falak here. She wanted to meet Ilham.
[22:05] I am calling off my wedding with you.
[22:20] You were right. Nazish was right. She trapped me. She turned me against Nawal.
[22:27] God knows what nonsense she fed me and I was so stupid I believe everything.
[22:33] She took me away from Nawal.
[22:37] She destroyed her own sister who loved her, who cared for her. You are a selfish and ungrateful woman.
[23:17] You're my blood. You would never take such a big step without my permission. I'm sure she turned you against me.
[23:33] You will be upset when you will know her real face.
[23:38] Her reality. She planned everything to turn you against me.
[23:45] You were such a big businessman. Such stupidity doesn't suit you, Hamza.
[23:52] Kabeer and I never had an affair. It was her plan.
[23:55] She took me to Kabeer's house and then called you there. All of this is her doing.
[24:01] Open your eyes and see whats happening with you!
[24:05] If I wanted to have an affair, I would have had one when you left me.
[24:10] She trapped you for her own benefits.
[24:49] Hello Mr. Kabeer. I wanted to inform you something very important.
[24:54] Yes, please tell me what is it?
[24:56] Sher Khan has been caught.
[24:59] This is a great news.
[25:02] And he said it was Hamza who told him to do all this.
[25:06] What? What did you say?
[25:10] Hamza? Hamza Hashim?
[25:13] What are you saying?
[25:15] I called to tell you this. The one who got your daughter kidnapped is Hamza Hashim.
[27:07] Hamza.. Sit here. I want to talk to you.
[27:22] What happened? Why are you worried?
[27:28] Its nothing.
[27:31] Hamza, I'm your mother. I can read your face.
[27:41] Its very clear that you're worried. Did Falak do something?
[27:49] See whatever is happening. Only Falak isn't at fault. You're at fault too.
[27:55] If a person gives someone else the power to decide for their life, this is what happens.
[28:05] Sir, Hamza. The police is here. They want to meet you.
[28:09] Police?
[28:12] Call them inside.
Sure.
[28:42] Yes Mr. SHO?
[28:44] Mr. Hamza we have an arrest warrant for you.
[28:46] what!
[28:47] You'll have to come with us right now.
[28:50] Why? What did my son do? Hamza? What is this?
[28:54] What crime did my son commit?
[28:59] Come.
[29:04] You can say whatever you want in the police station..
[29:07] Hamza, what are they doing?
[29:28] Mam, sir Hamza has been arrested by the police..
[29:34] What? Come on.
[29:55] Hamza? Hamza? Where are you taking him? Aunty, stop them..
[30:07] Its all because of you. You got this done.
[30:11] What did I do?
[30:14] Don't be so innocent. You got my son to kidnap your daughter.
[30:24] What are you saying? Tell me what happened..
[30:29] You're an ungrateful woman. I can expect anything from you.
[30:35]  I said the first day you shouldn't have come here.
[30:43] But my son wouldn't listen. Now see what happened. The police took him.
[30:49]  Aren't you ashamed?
[30:54] What are you saying? I have no idea about it.
[30:58] You don't? Why would my son do it?
[31:03] Not at all. You influenced him. You destroyed his life.
[31:09] I didn't do anything aunty. Why are you blaming me? I don't know whats happening.
[31:16] Its because of you, my daughter left the house and the police took my son!
[31:24] What sort of a woman are you? You could never belong to anyone.
[31:30] For God's sake, spare us. 
[31:32] Get lost from my house and never come back. I don't want to see your face again.
[31:40] What are you saying?
What else would I say?
[31:43]  Is it my fault? My house.. its empty. Its quiet. Look at us!
[31:53] What will you do? How much more will you eat away at our family?
[31:59] You will have to leave my house, right here. Right now.
[32:04] What are you saying aunty? Where will I go from this house? This is my husband's house.
[32:08] This isn't your husband's house. Its my house. And you will have to leave. Shakoor.. Faheem..
[32:15] Faiza.. Where are all of us? Throw her out of my house. Immediately.
[32:20] Listen to me. Where will I go? I have no place to go.
[32:25] What are you looking at my face for? Throw her out. And if she comes back again. Shoot her.
[32:32] Aunty listen to me.. Please.. What are you doing? Where will I go?
[33:59] There can not be another indifferent, selfish and cheap man like you.
[34:08] You had enmity with us. 
[34:11] Why did you bring our daughter in between? She's an innocent baby. 
[34:18] What sort of a human being are you?
[34:25] Thank God, you're behind the bars, Hamza. Or else I'd have killed you.
[34:34] Mr. Kabeer, sir is calling you. He needs you to sign some papers.
[35:10] You should be ashamed Hamza. 
[35:14] What I thought about you and what you turned out to be?!
[35:21] Such a low life? You fell so below that you would do anything to satisfy your ego?!
[35:33] You were never like this. What did Falak turn you into?!
[35:39] Look at yourself.
[35:44] Your anger and Falak.. where did they get you? 
[35:50] And you did everything because,
[35:54] you wanted to harm me and Kabeer?
[35:59]  I don't believe you would do all this.
[36:08] I hate you. A deep hate..
[36:29] I know I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
[36:45] And the biggest mistake I made was to leave you.
[36:52] I loved you very much Nawal...
[37:03] Trust me.. I destroyed my love with my own hands.
[37:18] When I left you.. I lost everything.
[37:29] Respect.. Fame.. And love..
[37:38] Everything..
[37:54] Whatever happened is good. Very good. That you didn't come in my life.
[38:07] I never deserved you.
[38:10]  I feel very small in front of you.
[38:22] Kabeer is a good guy. 
[38:25] You deserve Kabeer. He should be in your life.
[38:39] I know I'm not worth forgiving. 
[38:43] But still, I apologize to you.
[39:01] Just forgive me, once..
