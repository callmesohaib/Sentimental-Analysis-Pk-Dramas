[00:59] Nawal I want you to join the office again
[01:04] Hamza it is not possible
[01:06] Why?
[01:09] Because I have joined the new office a few days ago
[01:14] The company is good and its giving me a nice package
[01:18] What? How could you do this?
[01:22] I will not let you join any other company. You should have asked me before
[01:28] Hamza please don't be aggressive.
[01:31] Do you know what will happen if I join your office again?
[01:37] What will happen?
[01:39] Everybody will consider our commitment as an affair and will do my character assassination. I can't tolerate that
[01:46] What does it matter?
[01:48] We were serious about each other! We are engaged now and are going to get married
[01:54] If people get to know that my wife works in another company, what would everyone think?
[02:03] I am sorry Nawal but your are taking a very wrong decision
[02:07] Hamza please! I don't like all this. Don't argue with me
[02:12] Nawal you were never like this! Why do you think you are always right?
[02:20] Hello Falak! How are you?
[02:22] I am absolutely well! Where are you lost? No call or message!
[02:27] Yes I was a little busy. You tell
[02:30] What will you have?
[02:32] Whatever you are ordering, order for me too
[02:35] Sister are you outside? Was it Hamza?
[02:40] Yes I am having a lunch with him
[02:46] Hello! Falak! What happened?
[03:06] I have come here with a very special purpose
[03:09] Yes please
[03:11] The way Nawal took care of me in my illness, it's extraordinary, It was more than my own daughter could do.
[03:18] You have groomed her so well, she is so sweet
[03:24] Thank you so much
[03:26] I want Hamza and Nawal to marry soon so that I can take her home and my house can have some life!
[03:34] What?
[03:35] Hamza also wants the same! You might feel I am being hasty
[03:40] but it is good for the daughters to go to their in laws house as soon as possible
[03:44] You are right nut give me some time.
[03:49] I haven't even thought about it yet. I haven't even discussed it with anybody
[03:53] If course, you can take the advice. But please don't take long
[03:58] I want to say something, you are in a bit of haste.
[04:03] Please give us some time to do the preparations
[04:08] No there is absolutely no need of the preparations.
[04:12] The children can buy whatever they want to after their marriage. Why are you worrying about it?
[04:18] Thank you so much that you are so considerate.
[04:22] But trust me we want to do some preparations so, please don't stop us
[04:28] Okay as you wish
[04:32] Please have it
[04:34] Yes sure
[04:37] I want everyone in the meeting! Prepare a presentation and make sure nobody is missing!
[04:42] You may go now and you have five minutes
[04:52] Hello!
[04:54] Falak! How are you here? All good?
[04:58] Yes everything is fine. I was getting bored in house so thought of coming here for lunch
[05:03] Falak you could at least inform me well before coming
[05:08] I thought to give you a surprise! How is the surprise?
[05:13] now please don't say that you are busy
[05:16] Falak I am actually quite busy, I have an important meeting and I can't leave the meeting
[05:21] You are the boss of this office, you can cancel the meetings! Come on I am so hungry
[05:26] Falak listen! You just go home, we can' have any lunch now.
[05:30] Let me come home we will talk then
[05:32] Kabir I came for you to have lunch and you can't even cancel a few meetings!
[05:40] Please try to understand! I don't have any time to delay the meeting
[05:44] What have I thought? But you have absolutely no care of me.
[05:51] You just worry about your business! I thought we could spend some time together but look at you!
[05:56] I am sorry it was my fault!
[06:00] Falak listen to me Falak!
[06:08] Sir the client is waiting for you for the meeting
[06:12] Sure I am coming
[06:19] Miss Sophia came, she is asking for the marriage
[06:23] Mother that's so soon
[06:25] It is not early Nawal, you are older to Falak.
[06:29] It is always good for daughters to go to their in laws house soon
[06:34] But mother I had decided that I would get married after some time when this proposal was finalized.
[06:43] Please give me some time
[06:44] Daughter the times were different then
[06:49] We have seen Sophia, and we know how decent and well groomed she is!
[06:56] You have seen Hamza and you trust him now that he would never cheat on you!
[07:02] Now you know that he is loyal to you, you have tested him.
[07:08] Daughter there is a time for everything
[07:13] And I think that this time is the best for your wedding!
[07:18] How can we do all the preparations so fast?
[07:20] Everything will be done, we will take a month or two's time and this much time is sufficient for the wedding
[07:28] Hamza is a really nice man and I am sure that he would keep you really happy!
[07:37] Let me call brother and sister and let's see what do they feel about this
[07:56] Greetings
[07:59] Hey uncle!
[08:00] Hey! How are you?
[08:04] Oh
[08:06] Looks like you are quite tired today!
[08:10] Yes sister in law, there was so much work load, had no time free! There were meetings back to back
[08:15] Besides you work so hard too!
[08:20] Do one thing, you go change and I will get you tea
[08:24] Sister in law not tea, I am so hungry I will have dinner. I will tell Falak to get me dinner
[08:32] She is not a home
[08:34] She isn't at home? Where is she?
[08:38] I don't know
[08:44] Really? Let me call her
[08:48] Sure
[08:51] Hmm so where were we?
[08:53] Here
[08:54] What were the goblins saying?
[08:55] Those three were
[09:11] Spend the whole time sitting in boredom at house
[09:15] and he is calling me when I am sitting with my friends!
[09:30] Oh yes I know you are only sister of your brother! How can he marry without your presence?
[09:35] Of course I will keep sending you the updates! The wedding will take place after two or three months
[09:44] Take care of yourself and the kids! Okay we will talk later. Good Bye
[09:52] Did you talk to Sultana aunt?
[09:54] Yes I went to talk to her, she said she would discuss it with Nawal and her brother
[10:03] I was just talking to Nazish, she said her kids have exams in a month,
[10:09] so how about if we arrange the date after two months so that it is easier for everybody to attend the wedding?
[10:18] Two months is a very long time!
[10:23] Son it is a wedding!They need time for preparations!
[10:32] Hmm okay I'll wait then
[10:38] Ma'am dinner is ready
[10:41] Okay let's go
[10:42] Let's go
[11:00] Falak where have you been?
[11:03] I had been calling you for so long, you weren't picking up the call!
[11:06] I was busy
[11:07] Busy?
[11:09] What do you mean? Where were you busy? I had been so worried!
[11:15] Do you care for me?
[11:19] No right? Then why were you getting upset for me!
[11:22] It is useless to feel worried for me
[11:26] Falak what are you saying? Why wouldn't I care for you?
[11:30] You hadn't been so rude to reject my offer for lunch if you cared!
[11:35] Falak is it even something to get angry at?
[11:40] I was in such a good mood!
[11:43] What would happen if you went for a lunch with me!
[11:46] I could face a big loss!
[11:48] I have told you that we are starting a new business. And these are quite important meetings for this purpose
[11:55] These are your lame excuses! I know everything!
[11:59] Falak think whatever you want to! I can't explain anymore!
[12:06] Yes that's right! How can I explain you that there is a life out of business also! How can I explain you?
[12:15] Do you even remember the last time we went for an outing?
[12:19] When did we spend time together? No right? How would you remember?
[12:24] I think it has been years to our wedding not months!
[12:28] This relationship has no charm, no happiness! There is nothing in our relation
[12:38] Falak we are fighting without any reason!
[12:41] You want to go outside right? Okay I will take you out for lunch tomorrow!
[12:48] Don't do this favor to me!
[12:50] You should take rest, you must be so tired after attending so many meetings!
[12:56] Falak!
[13:17] Hello! Hello! Hello
[13:18] Greetings
[13:20] Greetings! How are you daughter?
[13:23] I am fine how are you? Are you going somewhere?
[13:26] Yes I am going to meet a few friends!
[13:28] Oh I thought we would sit together and have a little chat
[13:32] Oh I didn't know that! Actually I made this plan many months ago so I am afraid I can't cancel it.
[13:38] You sit with him, I will be back in two hours!
[13:43] Okay
[13:44] Take care of her till I am back
[13:45] I will
[13:45] Behave
[13:47] Okay! I am surprised to see that she loves you more than I do!
[13:53] What's going to happen after the wedding!
[13:56] Anyways, let me show you something!
[14:01] Come on!
[14:02] Then we started the performance
[14:05] How many food stalls were there?
[14:06] There were so many!
[14:08] Greetings
[14:09] Greetings!
[14:10] Uncle!
[14:12] My doll! Love you
[14:14] Uncle I am not a doll, I am a fairy!
[14:18] How was the annual function?
[14:20] Perfect!
[14:21] And how did you perform?
[14:22] Great!
[14:23] That's my girl!
[14:25] Come here to me!
Sister in law
[14:29] Yes
[14:30] This is for you
[14:33] What is this?
[14:34] It is something I should have done a long time back
[14:37] Tell me! You are worrying me
[14:39] These are the share papers of our business! I have given half of the shares to you
[14:50] What? There was no need for this Kabir
[14:54] How do you say that brother?
[14:56] It was pre-decided that I and sister in law were the equal partners in the business
[15:03] And that I have given to sister in law. I have just done the documentation right now
[15:06] You keep this Kabir, it is all yours
[15:09] No sister in law, this is your share. I can never keep this!
[15:20] Many congratulations sister in law. Now you are officially the business partner!
[15:26] Thank you. Everything belongs to Kabir, now and will always
[15:56] Look at this
[16:30] You have kept this all safe till now?
[16:34] Everything
[16:37] This all is too precious for me!
[16:40] It reminds me of you
[16:45] You used to tease me a lot that I keep all tiny things safe and give them so much importance!
[16:50] Now look at you!
[16:55] Do you remember this?
[16:58] I gifted it to you
[17:01] Yes and this?
[17:04] You broke it in my hand!
[17:08] This picture? You have kept all this !
[17:12] Don't be too surprised! I am showing you all these things to assure you how deeply I love you!
[17:24] I am actually quite surprised! Hey! I wore this in university
[18:04] You have given her half the business shares! You didn't even think once about what she did with me!!
[18:14] Falak there is no connection between house and official matters
[18:17] Why is there no connection? We live in the same house!
[18:21] She used all the tactics to kick me out of this house!
[18:26] Kabir you wanted to stay with them, I never objected.
[18:29] You gave them half the business I didn't say a word. But yo have to listen what I am going to say
[18:34] This house belongs to Tauqeer brother right
[18:37] Yes
[18:38] Tell him to give write half of this house for me in property!
[18:44] What? What are you saying? Have you lost your mind?
[18:50] Why are you so shocked?
[18:52] If this house is in my share, at least Alia sister can't kick me out of this house!
[18:58] It is Impossible Falak! Nobody would kick you out of here! You should trust me!
[19:10] Why is it impossible? If you can sacrifice, he can do!
[19:13] Why do we have to suffer always?
[19:17] Kabir I am telling you the right thing!
[19:21] If everything is getting shared then why not this house! Go talk to Tauqeer brother
[19:28] You have said and I have heard! Now end it here.
[19:32] I don't want to listen to this ever again!
[19:35] Do you know what do you want? You want me to die in this house!
[20:14] What happened? Why are you crying?
[20:17] Leave it sister! How are you and mom?
[20:21] We are fine but you are not. What happened again?
[20:25] It is a daily routine
[20:28] Did Kabir say anything?
[20:31] Falak tell me now!
[20:33] What will happen if I tell you? Will you come here to settle this thing?
[20:37] We can come if we have to. Tell me what happened
[20:44] Kabir has given half of the business to Alia sister
[20:47] She already had that share, did he give her all of it?
[20:51] No its the same
[20:53] The same share! At first it was not in documentation but now he got the papers ready
[20:59] Falak she was already the owner of half of it! So what happened?
[21:06] Why are you crying? It was always hers!
[21:10] When the business is being split then why not the house?
[21:13] I asked Kabir to get the house split as well
[21:17] But he scolded me! He asked me to keep quiet! Can't I ask for my right?
[21:25] Falak you are being childish! Everything that Kabir has is yours!
[21:31] Nothing is mine! Tell me something! If they make my share in the house then I would have some security that nobody would kick me out of this house!
[21:48] Sister you leave it! You can never understand! Pay my regards to mother. I will talk later
[22:01] What was she saying? Is everything okay?
[22:06] Nothing much. Kabir has scolded her
[22:08] What happened? I wanted to talk Nawal
[22:13] Talk to her tomorrow. She is impulsive right now
[22:32] You must be so happy right?
[22:34] You flattered my husband and got the business! I must appreciate you
[22:39] What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[22:41] You have been watching my husband's business like a snake!
[22:46] You captured the whole business by helping him a little bit!
[22:53] Wow! I a highly impressed!
[22:57] You are so clever and cunning! And you call me smart! I can never reach your level
[23:08] And Kabir? He is so stupid! He never knows the snakes he has around
[23:14] Beware! Don't say a word!
[23:19] If I am listening to you that doesn't mean you say whatever you want to!
[23:23] I can't compensate for the pain you are feeling right now! Nobody can!
[23:28] And this house and this business? I don't need any of it! Thank God we have enough already
[24:10] You have been watching my husband's business like a snake!
[24:16] You captured the whole business by helping him a little bit!
[24:22] And Kabir? He is so stupid! He never knows the snakes he has around! Beware!
[24:37] Tauqeer brother since the time you have given me the responsibility of this house, sister in law keeps on disturbing me.
[24:42] She keeps taunting me. Please give everything back to her
[24:47] She has moved the foundations of this house!
[24:49] She is giving a different color to everything! She is the one who has planted the seed of doubts
[24:54] Don't trust me but you all are going to repent the day you see her real face!
[24:59] Sister in law I am not doing any drama or accusing her, 
[25:03] I just request you that don't groom your daughter like your own self!
[25:07] She appears to be innocent but she is a hypocrite! The time will tell I was right
[25:12] When this house will fall, then you will understand!
[25:18] What have I done? How would I face Alia now?
[25:25] I feel suffocated mother. 
[25:28] Kabir doesn't listen to me now
[25:32] And Alia sister is so poisonous! She taunts me all the time
[25:39] Now you tell me what should I do?
[25:44] I will talk to Kabir to give you your right! 
[25:49] Don't worry! You are not helpless or an orphan
[25:56] It is enough what we have done mother! 
[26:01] You talked to them before as well, but they made many promises but didn't fulfill any!
[26:06] I feel like a useless thing in that house who has no importance
[26:13] Mother Kabir has changed. He isn't the same man I married
[26:18] Don't worry
[26:20] Everything will be fine, you stop crying
[26:23] Falak control yourself!
[26:25] Nothing will be fixed! it feels as if he has become unaware of me completely
[26:32] He doesn't care about me
[26:35] Daughter you need to stay put
[26:38] Greetings
[26:45] What happened?
[26:46] She is worried because of Kabir
[26:50] Falak I have told you a multiple times not to stress out because of Kabir , 
[26:55] wipe your tears now and eat this dessert
[26:58] Dessert but what for? Please eat it
[27:05] Now tell me what is this for?
[27:09] Come with me, come on!
[27:15] Okay let's see what it is!
[27:18] Look at this
[27:25] Whose car is this Nawal?
[27:27] It is mine of course!
[27:30] Oh wow! That's great
[27:33] How did you get it?
[27:35] Hamza must have given you
[27:37] No It is from the company! I had booked it a week before! So it has come now. 
[27:41] How is it mother?
[27:42] It is really nice! Many congratulations
[27:45] I will take you both for a dinner to celebrate this! But first we will go for a drive
[27:49] Okay
[27:50] No I will go home, Kabir would be waiting for me!
[27:53] Hey! I will talk to Kabir myself! Come on he won't stop you
[28:28] Brother
[28:29] Yes
[28:31] What is it? Why are you sitting here alone like this?
[28:37] Nothing important!
[28:39] You look tensed brother
[28:44] I am worried because of the house matters!
[28:48]  I don't know till how long is it going to go like this!
[28:54] Brother there are always some differences when you live together. 
[29:00] Just like that there are some differences between Alia sister and Falak
[29:07] But I am hopeful that they both will understand each other
[29:14] Kabir what do you think? Who is wrong?
[29:22] Brother to be honest I can't comment but a conflict is always two sided. 
[29:29] Alia sister is wrong in some matters and in some matters it is Falak!
[29:36] Excuse me brother, it is Hamza's call
[29:43] Hi Hamza! How are you?
[29:45] I am fine, how are you?
[29:47] I am good
[29:48] I am inviting my friends over for a dinner to celebrate my engagement. 
[29:54] You surely have to come with your family!
[29:56] Great I will definitely come!
[30:00] You will receive an invitation card tomorrow. But I wanted to invite you personally as well
[30:04] Thank you friend. I will be there
[30:07] Do bring Falak along! It is friends with family! Okay?
[30:13] Okay
[30:15] Okay see you then! Bye
[30:20] It was Hamza's call. He was inviting over dinner
[30:24] What were we talking about brother?
[30:27] Tell me something, the people you have started the business with, who are they?
[31:01] You are back
[31:02] Hmm
[31:04] How are aunt and Nawal?
[31:06] They are fine. Kabir I want to change the car
[31:11] How have you thought about changing the car?
[31:16] I have been driving the same car since I came in this house. 
[31:20] Are you booking a car for me or should I do it myself?
[31:22] Falak I am investing in a business, please wait for some time!
[31:28] What do you mean? You don't have money?
[31:31] No I do have money, but wait for some time. I will get you
[31:38] Then say that you don't want to get me a car
[31:43] Falak what has happened to you? Why do you criticize every time?
[31:49] Should I not criticize? You never fulfill any of my wish!
[31:53]  I had so many wishes before marriage and yet Nawal sister never said a no to my wish
[32:00] And you have nothing to give me. You don't even give me your time,
[32:04]  you just scold me every time I say something
[32:06] You don't even take me out! There is nothing in our marriage. 
[32:12] Since the time I have come in this house, I have been suffering for every little thing. I feel suffocated here!
[32:38] What's wrong? Won't you come to eat anything?
[32:42] I am not hungry
[32:46] I am not feeling well also
[32:48] What happened to you?
[32:51] You have no fever then what happened?
[32:53] What are you feeling?
[32:55] Alia come sit here
[33:07] Alia if I apologize
[33:13] Will you forgive me?
[33:16] Forgive you for what Tauqeer?
[33:22] To shut my eyes and ears
[33:34] That I didn't trust you at all. 
[33:40] Do you know Alia 
[33:45] good people have a bad habit, 
[33:51] they consider everybody as good as themselves
[34:00] And I had this misunderstanding about Falak also,
[34:07]  I considered her good as well
[34:18] Alia please forgive me
[34:19] What?
[34:20] Please forgive me
[34:21] What are you doing Tauqeer?
[34:23] I don't have the courage to accept my mistake, please Alia
[34:29] I didn't trust you and cursed you so badly, Alia I am highly embarrassed
[34:40] Please
[34:42] Tauqeer! Tauqeer what happened to you?
[34:50] What is happening to you? Are you okay?
[34:54] I am feeling so much tightness in my chest! I feel as if I am dying
[35:01] Tauqeer drink some water
[35:04] Alia I think I am about to die
[35:08] Tauqeer! Tauqeer! Whats happening? Kabir! Kabir!
[35:45] Sister in law, please have courage. Nothing will happen to Tauqeer brother
[35:51] It has been so long the doctor isn't coming out. 
[35:54] Kabir please check if he has become conscious or not
[36:00] Sister please don't worry! I asked the doctor, his treatment is going on. 
[36:04] He will be fine. Just pray for him
[36:09] He is absolutely right! Please have some courage. Nothing will happen
[36:20] How is everything doctor?
[36:24] Everything is fine and he is out of danger now
[36:32] Thank God! I told you sister he will be fine
[36:42] Is he conscious?
[36:43] No he isn't conscious now but he will. 
[36:47] It was a minor attack of angina. He needs maximum rest
[36:52] Yes we will take a great care. Don't worry! Thank you so much
[36:57] You're most welcome
[37:03] I told you sister he will be alright. It's a minor attack. Please be patient and don't worry
[37:14] Please sit down
[37:40] Kabir what happened to Tauqeer brother? Has he become conscious?
[37:46] I have seen my brother for the first time in this condition.
[37:49]  He was getting breathless and I could feel myself dying!
[37:54] Don't say that! He will be all fine
[37:58] I am trying but seeing him like this is making me feel quite weak!
[38:08] How can I take care of the one who took care of me! 
[38:16] Just pray that he stays healthy
[38:20] Pray that nothing happens to the hands that rise in prayers for me
[38:24] Don't talk like this Kabir! He will very soon go with us to our house! Nothing will happen to him
[38:30] With God's will
[38:32] Be patient
[38:35] You must be tired. Yo should go home
[38:38] You must be tired too
[38:40] But I can't leave sister in law alone here. There must be someone with her. 
[38:45] She could need anything
[38:48] Please you go
[38:50] I know but I will remain tensed even at home
[38:55] I know Falak but Hafsa is alone at home, 
[38:59] somebody should be there to watch her. She would be crying
[39:03] I'll go if you say so but I really don't want to leave you alone here
[39:10] Let me meet sister in law
[39:13] Okay

[39:38] She hasn't slept yet?
[39:40] She is forcing to meet her parents
[39:44] I want to go to my parents, will you please take me to them?
[39:48] You can sleep now, I will take you in the morning
[39:51] But I can't sleep alone. Mother makes me sleep daily
[39:55] You will sleep with Falak aunt tonight
[40:00] Let's go aunt
[40:04] Go to your room
[40:05] But she said you would make me sleep
[40:08] Listen to what I have said! Take her to her room and make her sleep!
