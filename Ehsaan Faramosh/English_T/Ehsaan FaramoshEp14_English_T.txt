[00:12] What happened? Tell me.
Don't contact me again now.
[00:17] Change your habit to make fun of me everywhere.
[00:21] If you couldn't convince me then you asked your mother to call me.
[00:28] To me you are like Kabir.
[00:31] I never thought about separating you and Kabir nor to make you unhappy.
[00:37] I know.
[00:39] You forced me to come here and tell everything to aunt.
[00:43] I hate you so much that you can't even think.
[00:48] What am I doing?
[00:50] You have invited her intentionally and now you are trying to engage her with me.
[00:56] I am understanding all your planning.
[00:58] I know what is right for me and what is wrong. And I don't want to do job at the moment.
[01:04] You are my fiance.
[01:06] You every decision will effect lives of both of us.
[01:09] Perhaps you don't have an idea about it.
[01:19] That much irresponsibility Javaid? How can anyone show so much irresponsibility?
[01:24] You left a little girl alone in car. It's the limit.
[01:28] It was my mistake sir, I thought to buy some things and miss Hafsa never got out of car like that but today.
[01:36] Check the surrounding area, she must be around. Where can my daughter go?
[01:39] We have searched the whole area, Aliya but she is nowhere.
[01:43] I don't know Toqeer bring my daughter back. Why are you standing here? Go and find her.
[01:47] Control yourself, I have informed police and they will be arriving soon.
[01:51] What are you talking about? How can I control myself.
Just calm down.
[01:57] Salman has arrived.
[02:09] Hey Salman
Toqeer
[02:12] Don't worry, we will find Hafsa, I have deputed police everywhere.
[02:17] Tell me if you have any doubt on someone or any enemy?
[02:22] Salman I have no enemy and I never fought with anyone.
[02:25] Have you ever had a business conflict or any matter like that?
[02:31] Have you fought with someone sister?
[02:33] Salman, I am telling you that there is no such thing. I would have told you if there was any such thing.
[02:38] Look, there are some competitors in business who exploits such opportunities.
[02:43] I am asking all of this to find some clue.
[02:48] We haven't fought with anyone and we don't have any enemy, please find my daughter.
[02:54] Do we have any enemy? Sister we are trying very hard.
[02:56] Aliya, control yourself
[02:57] You don't worry and go home. Toqeer take sister home.
[03:03] God willing we will recover Hafsa very soon. OK.
[03:07] What was he saying?
Let's go home and talk about it.
[03:27] If I didn't get my daughter then I will die.
[03:32] How are you so calm?
[03:34] Aliya, I talk to them, just pray to God may he do better for us.
[03:44] I don't know whether she would have eaten something or not. Bring my daughter back. I don't need water.
[04:11] You are looking beautiful.
Thank you.
[04:17] I don' know why sister is not receiving my call? I am calling her for so long.
[04:25] Sister, are you crying?
[04:32] Why are you crying, tell me?
Kabir, Hafsa.. Hafsa?
[04:40] What happened to Hafsa?
[04:42] Kabir Hafsa has been lost somewhere. I don't know in which condition she would be?
[04:49] What?
[04:51] What are you talking about sister?
[04:54] Let me talk to brother Toqeer.
[04:57] Toqeer talk to him.
[05:01] What's up Kabir?
[05:03] I will call you back, IG is calling me.
Brother Toqeer.
[05:09] What happened to Hafsa Kabir? What were they saying?
[05:13] I don't know, sister was crying and saying that Hafsa has been lost somewhere.
[05:16] What? How has she lost?
I don't understand.
[05:22] Do one thing, just pack the luggage. Let me check if there is any flight available.
[05:27] Relax Kabir, they will find Hafsa.
[05:30] I am checking flights. Please do pack things.
Kabir
[06:57] Brother Toqeer, any news on Hafsa?
[07:01] No Kabir, no news as yet.
[07:04] Brother please talk to I.G. Police won't get active like this. If you say, I will talk to him.
[07:10] Kabir, I have talked to Salman and he ensured that they will find Hafsa.
[07:17] Just pray for her. When is your flight?
[07:23] I have booked tomorrow morning's flight after so much effort. We are packing things up.
[07:30] Kabir, Salman is calling me. I will call you back.
[07:34] Hello what's up Salman?
[07:37] What?
[07:39] In which hospital?
[07:41] Yes, I am just coming. Bye.
[07:45] What happened Toqeer? Is my daughter alright?
[07:48] I don't know, she is in hospital. Let's go.
[07:55] Where is Mr. Salman?
[07:59] Salman. Please tell me, my daughter is alright?
She is just unconscious, doctors are giving her treatment.
[08:07] Take me to her, she will get better when she will see me. Where is she? Aliya?
[08:11] Let me see once.
[08:15] Be patient and pray for her.
[08:22] She is fine now. You can take her home after a while.
[08:28] Try to take good care of her. She is in trauma at the moment.
[08:36] Thank you doctor.
Thank you.
[08:44] Salman, you have given us a new life.
[08:47] I am unable to understand that how do I thank you buddy.
[08:51] I can't repay this favor of yours for the rest of my life.
[08:54] If you want to thank then don't thank me, he is Mr. Mubarak,
[08:59] thank him that she brought Hafsa to hospital.
[09:02] It's his favor that he brought Hafsa to hospital and informed police as well.
[09:09] Sir, thank you so very much.
[09:13] God will give you good reward for this.
[09:15] No need to thanks, you have got your daughter, take care of her. Good bye.
[10:01] What happened Aliya? Why are you crying now?
[10:08] What would I do if anything happened to my daughter?
No.
[10:19] God is very merciful.
[10:25] We never did bad and wrong to anyone till date.
[10:31] We never hurt anyone, rather we always took care of everyone.
[10:41] They how could God snatch the biggest and cutest thing of our life?
[10:52] He sees everything and never let His servants hopeless.
[11:00] So wipe out your tears and thank God.
[11:08] That we got our daughter back safe and sound.
Did you inform Kabir?
[11:17] Yes, I talked to him.
[11:22] Oh, in fact he is calling me. I will be back.
[11:42] Did you miss uncle?
So much.
[11:44] If you will ever get off the car then I will teach you lesson.
[11:47] What happened brother?
[11:50] By the way when I called and told you that we have found Hafsa and she is alright then why did you come back?
[11:58] And that too so quickly like this. You should have stayed there for few more days.
[12:03] You are talking about staying there for few more days, I can't tell you how have I passed a single minute there?
[12:09] I was so anxious to come back.
[12:14] And you that Hafsa is so attached to me. She is my life.
[12:24] By the way, it was sister's mistake.
[12:27] Whatever the reason she should have gone to pick Hafsa.
[12:31] What was the need to send driver no matter how important work was.
[12:36] Exactly.
[12:38] Exactly, I said to her that she should have gone there herself.
[12:41] Sister has put the burden of every responsibility on her shoulders.
[12:46] No one is bigger than his own children for us.
[12:50] Get away the business. Am I right Kabir?
[12:55] This is not the case Falak.
[12:58] Sister fulfills her every responsibility very well, whether it is related to office or home.
[13:04] Whatever has happened, it was my mistake.
[13:07] If I were here then sister wouldn't have faced this problem.
[13:11] I shouldn't have gone. I am sorry sister.
[13:18] Why is this your mistake, our trip was already planned?
[13:23] Whatever the case may be but a mother can handle responsibility of children better than anyone.
[13:28] Business responsibilities can be handled by anyone.
[13:35] Falak is absolutely right. Family always comes first than business.
[13:44] Hafsa is responsibility of all of us,
[13:52] not only sister's.
[13:55] Sister, from now on I will pick Hafsa from school.
[14:06] OK
[14:11] Well, it's too late now. You are tired. Take some rest and then we will meet at dinner.
[14:17] Sure.
[14:23] Kabir you should go with her. How will she unpack things alone? Hafsa come here my child.
[14:34] Sister ask maid to bring tea upstairs.
OK I will tell her.
[14:38] Ask Nasreen to give them tea upstairs.
Nasreen.
[14:47] If two persons will earn together then they can live their life comfortably and do some savings as well.
[14:53] When two persons are sharing their lives with each other then why can't they share expenses?
[15:03] I have just started an IT company and I need your support.
[15:08] I thought that I will ask you to take loan from your company. I need a huge investment.
[15:17] Nawal, you are sitting here and I was searching you in whole house.
[15:25] What happened? Is everything alright? Why are you so quiet?
[15:33] Should I tell mom about Asad? No.
[15:38] Mom's health is not good. She must be more worried.
[15:45] Nawal
Yes
[15:49] Are you worried my child?
[15:52] No, my head was aching so I sat here. Tell me, do you want something?
[15:57] Yes
[15:59] I was going to doctor for checkup so I thought to ask you whether you will go with me?
[16:04] But leave it now, you have an head ache, take rest I will go myself.
[16:09] No, no.
[16:11] No, there is no severe head ache, I will go with you. Just give me five minutes, I will be back.
[16:16] Sure?
Yes of course.
[16:27] Hamza
Yes
[16:34] You won't go to your room without listening to me.
[16:39] What happened? Tell me, is everything alright?
[16:43] You can't hide your sorrow by pretending as you don't know anything.
[16:48] I have asked you so many times that what's the problem? But you didn't tell me.
[16:54] Why are you angry? Why are you distant from me?
[16:58] Talk to me, I am worried. You are self prison.
[17:06] I can't see you like this my child.
[17:13] What happened tell me?
Son.
[17:17] When fate closes one door then that shouldn't be knocked again and again. I tried to make you love your fate.
[17:28] But I failed.
[17:31] I have understood this, you should also understand this as well. Move on with your life.
[17:39] Don't do this to yourself, please.
[17:43] My son, I have chosen Areej for you.
[17:51] Both of you will stay very happy together. Trust me. Please.
[18:30] But your trip was just started. You came back so early?
Yes, because of sister Aliya.
[18:36] We came back because of sister Aliya.
[18:39] She pretends to be miss perfect but we faced the consequences of her mistake.
[18:43] What do you mean? What happened?
[18:46] Hafsa was lost and very next second sister called Kabir and cried so tell me, could Kabir stay there for a single second?
[18:55] So we came back. Who does this? She called Kabir,
[19:00] that was not a big incident that she informed whole city. No one was dead, they could find her.
[19:07] That was not a big thing.
[19:10] What are you talking about Falak?
[19:13] She is her only daughter and it's not a minor thing for her that her daughter get lost.
[19:17] Stop it sister Nawal, you don't know the conspiracies of sister Aliya.
[19:21] She should have thought about us, we are recently married but no
[19:26] everyone is concerned about sister Aliya, everyone follows her.
[19:33] Whatever sister, I will talk to you at home. Pay my greetings to mom. Bye.
[20:14] Aliya, I am noticing you that you are so depressed. Thank God Hafsa is alright.
[20:33] Toqeer I am not upset because of Hafsa.
[20:39] Then what's the reason?
[20:44] You and me are together for so long. You know me very well.
[20:52] You can testify that it's part of my nature that I want to keep everything perfect around me, my house,
[21:02] my family and my relations.
[21:09] But I am failed in Falak's matter.
[21:18] What do you mean? Why are you mentioning Falak here?
[21:25] I feel that I made a mistake in understanding Falak.
[21:35] She was talking on phone with someone, I heard her discussion.
[21:42] I can't tell you that how suspicious she is about me.
[21:49] She was saying that I have created this drama only to bring her and Kabir back from honeymoon. What?
[22:01] I am really sad about it that I can't tell you.
[22:06] As much as Kabir is dear to me, Falak is that much dear to me too.
[22:10] I can't think bad about her but she is thinking so much
[22:15] Aliya I know, she has just come to this house.
[22:21] Give her some time. She will understand your sincerity and love. Give her sometime.
[22:28] You know it very well that I am not negative.
[22:32] I have tried to deal Falak in a positive way.
[22:37] But now I am feeling scared that due to these misconceptions Falak might cause some damage. Sister.
[22:55] What has Falak said to you?
[22:57] Hey Kabir, when did you come? Come sit here.
[23:04] Listen sister.
[23:06] If you wouldn't tell me then I have heard your words.
[23:18] I am feeling sad that how can Falak think like that. And why didn't you tell me this earlier?
[23:27] There was no such thing which I would tell you. It's just her misunderstanding.
[23:35] And I will talk to her and correct everything. Don't worry.
[23:40] No sister you have always been doing this and you will be doing this and keep hiding from me.
[23:53] I am sad that you have got hurt because of Falak and I can't endure that.
[24:06] I should talk to her.
Kabir, Kabir listen. Kabir
[24:18] She will apologize to you for her act.
[24:24] And this is my order.
[24:26] I can't sell this house.
[24:28] Falak is married in a very rich family, she doesn't need anything and she won't ask for her share.
[24:35] I am not in favor of selling this house at all.
[24:47] What have you said to sister Aliya?
[24:51] What do you mean? I haven't said anything to her. What happened?
[24:55] Don't lie.
[24:59] Go and see.
What is going on in your mind?
[25:03] What is the misunderstanding and misconception among you, tell me about that, I will remove that.
[25:08] Why are you angry Kabir? I am unable to understand anything, what happened?
[25:12] It should be enough for you to understand that sister Aliya is like a mother to me.
[25:16] She arranged our marriage with so much love so I expect this from you that you accept this relationship happily.
[25:24] OK, what do you think that I don't give importance to relations and I didn't give respect to this relation?
[25:31] Because you are discussing things with others for no reason
[25:33] and sister Aliya got hurt because of that and I can't bear that.
[25:39] What happened to him Toqeer?
It's their personal matter, how can I intervene?
[25:44] Aliya. Aliya
[25:46] I didn't do anything like that. You must have been misunderstood or she has provoked you against me.
[25:50] Mind you language Falak.
[25:52] If I wouldn't ask sister Aliya today then she didn't tell me.
[25:56] She would hide your acts today as well.
Kabir
[26:01] What happened to you? Why are you getting so hyper?
[26:04] You must be feeling so happy.
[26:08] You must be very peaceful by seeing us fight like this.
[26:11] No Falak I can't even think that way.
[26:14] Don't lie.
[26:15] What did I say to you? Tell Kabir. Why are you lying?
Falak.
[26:22] Behave yourself, you are blaming sister Aliya in front of me.
[26:30] Apologize to her.
[26:37] Apologize to her.
[26:44] When I didn't do anything then why do I apologize? I won't apologize.
[26:48] Kabir just keep quiet. I don't want any apology and I don't have any complains as well. Now end this fight.
[26:56] Sister, she will apologize for her act.
[27:03] And this is my order.
[27:05] OK fine.
[27:07] If she will feel proud due to my apology then I apologize to her.
[27:12] I will be careful next time that you don't get hurt because of my actions.
[27:20] This is a forceful apology. You have done injustice to me.
[27:33] You shouldn't have done this, she is angry. Now go and please her.
[27:39] Sister, to avoid anything bad in future, it was good that has happened today, so please relax.
[27:49] Now Falak has known that what is your value in this house for me?
[28:07] How much toxic sister Aliya is, I can't even tell you.
[28:12] Really? I consider her as a very nice woman.
[28:16] Yes there must be a misunderstanding. Aliya can't be like that.
[28:20] This is the problem.
[28:21] She pretends to be so sweet in front of everyone.
[28:24] But she is so bitter from inside. Everything is a lie and show off.
[28:32] She keep creating hindrances in my happiness after my marriage.
[28:37] She doesn't want to see me happy with Kabir.
[28:40] I don't know why she is so jealous.
[28:42] She keeps Kabir busy in work all the time and keeps him busy all the time so that he can't pass time with me.
[28:48] Why didn't you tell us about it earlier, Falak?
[28:53] How would I tell you? I didn't want you to get worried.
[28:58] Despite I was so worried but I thought that it was my house's matter so I will handle it myself.
[29:04] My God knows that how I am passing my life there with sister Aliya.
[29:08] Doesn't Kabir take care of you?
[29:11] Kabir
[29:12] He gets angry if I say anything about sister Aliya.
[29:17] He doesn't take care of me. He asks me to apologize for minor things.
[29:22] If anything happens then he says, go and apologize to sister Aliya.
[29:26] Apology?
[29:30] You are not helpless Falak, I will talk to Aliya myself. She can't do this to you.
[29:37] No mom, there is no need for that.
[29:40] If you will talk to her than the matter will get complex and my married life will be suffered.
[29:45] It's my domestic matter, I will handle it myself.
[29:48] I was feeling so said today that's why I shared my feelings with you.
[29:54] Falak don't hide anything, we are with you.
[29:59] Yes
[31:55] So quickly? It's not possible to manage it so quickly.
Why?
[32:00] But you were insisting on quick marriage earlier.
[32:03] Aunt, earlier the situation was different. I have started a new company.
[32:09] All my savings have been utilized, I need more funds and I am arranging that.
[32:17] And we live in a rented house.
[32:19] So, it will take some time to buy our own house.
[32:23] Sister Sultana, it's my first son's marriage.
[32:26] And you know how much a mother desires about her son's marriage.
[32:29] You forbade us on engagement but I will manage wedding function in a good way.
[32:34] Yes
[32:36] I can understand the desires of a mother and I have so many wishes regarding Nawal's marriage too.
[32:45] And I will leave nothing.
[32:48] I will fulfill my each desire, God willing.
[32:53] Aunt, I am against dowry.
[32:56] But what do I do? Situation is so uncertain these days.
[32:58] If you don't have your own house then dower (things) will become garbage.
[33:04] Sister Sultana, Asjad is absolutely right, the house should be our own.
[33:08] By the grace of God, Nawal has lived her life very happily.
[33:11] It belongs to you but everything will go to your daughter. Am I right?
[33:18] I didn't understand your point.
[33:23] Transfer the ownership of this house to Nawal.
[33:27] We will get the house and your desire of giving dower will also be fulfilled.
[33:33] My property?
[33:42] What are you thinking after Asjad's opinion.
[33:46] Aren't you thinking that we are greedy for your house?
[33:51] I have already told you about my problems. I have nothing in hand at the moment. 
[33:55] How will I keep her happy?
[33:58] Sister Sultana, Asjad is absolutely right. 
[34:01] We have utilized everything for business and we need more funds.
[34:06] Consider this as our compulsion.
[34:13] And if it is not possible then let's delay marriage for two years.
[34:20] Two years? 
[34:22] But two years is a very long period sister Nosheen.
[34:30] My life is not certain, I want to see Nawal married and living happily in her house.
[34:41] This is my only wish.
[34:44] Then sell this house and give that amount as a loan to Asjad.
[34:50] What?
[34:55] What are you talking about?
[34:58] There is nothing to worry. Son-in-law is also a son if someone consider it. 
[35:04] And I am only asking her to give that amount as a loan.
[35:19] You are right but whatever I own belongs to my both daughters.
[35:28] I can't sell this house.
[35:31] Falak is married in a rich family. She doesn't need all this. She won't ask you for her share as well.
[35:38] I am not in favor of selling this house at all.
[35:41] Mom, just leave them.
[35:44] I don't need their money. I will arrange myself.
[35:48]  I don't want to take any favor from them. Let's go.
[35:51] Don't be so angry. Let me talk.
[35:55] What will you talk? Everything is clear. Nothing is left. 
[36:00] We have agreed with them every time and now if we are demanding then they are making excuses.
[36:06] Don't get angry. Let me talk.
[36:11] Sister Sultana, don't mind on Asjad's words.
[36:16] Look, relatives support their relatives in need.
[36:21] You are right but?
[36:22] For whom Asjad is doing this? For Nawal and her good future.
[36:28] Now decision will be yours, we will be waiting for your call. Let's go.
[37:05] What happened? In which tone you were talking to them?
[37:09]  You will destroy the whole game in this way.
[37:13] I don't like your aggressive behavior.
[37:17]  If I wouldn't have tackled that matter wisely then this matter would have been ended.
[37:21] I didn't like to repeat same thing again and again.
[37:26] We have left the ball in their court and they will inform us what they want, it's simple. 
[37:32] It's not that simple which you are assuming.
[37:35] I told you that let me handle this matter myself but no, you had to do what you want. 
[37:41] If I would have handled this matter then this would have been closed.
[37:47] Don't worry, this matter will be resolved. Just wait and see.
[37:53] I feel that they will refuse.
[37:57] It's not that simple. 
[38:01] I know that they won't refuse.
[38:03] If it comes to breaking relationships then anyone gets ready to pay a huge amount to save his honor 
[38:10] and this is just a matter of a house.
[38:18] I thought that I will discuss regarding marriage and they will agree immediately.
[38:26] I couldn't even imagine that they will raise a demand like this.
[38:30] Mom, Asjad has discussed with me earlier regarding money.
[38:35] He was asking me to take loan from my company but I resigned before that. 
[38:39] Why didn't you tell me earlier Nawal?
[38:43] I didn't want to upset you.
[38:51] Mom, didn't we made mistake in recognizing Asjad and his family?
[38:59] What do you mean?
[39:01] I mean, earlier they were refusing to take dowry and now they are demanding all this.
[39:09] Don't you worry my child.
[39:11] I will call Arfa today, 
[39:14] I will know the reality after talking to her.
