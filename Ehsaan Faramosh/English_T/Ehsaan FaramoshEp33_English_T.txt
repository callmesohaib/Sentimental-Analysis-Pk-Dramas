[01:29] Why did you have to order so much? Whose going to eat all this?
[01:32] Mom, since its my treat, I'll order what I like. As it is, you people eat.
[01:39] Falak, you know mom and I won't eat that much. All the food will go waste.
[01:45] I'm happy to order it, please.
[01:48] No tension about the money.
[01:50] Take care of the money dear. You'll need them someday.
[01:53] Mom, I've been offered 3 commercials and Maria is saying all payments will be in advance so no tension about the money.
[02:00] May God bless you.
[02:08] Hello Ms. Nawal.
[02:10] Mr. Shirazi, you?
[02:13] I had a meeting with a client. I was going back and I saw you.
[02:20] Will you not introduce us?
[02:22] Of course. He is Mr. Shirazi, CEO of Shirazi Group and my boss.
[02:27] Its good to meet you. Nawal praises you often
[02:31] Even I liked it.
[02:33] Please come and join us. Tell him please.
[02:37] Yes, please.
[02:40] I'm sorry. I'm in a rush or else I'd join you.
[02:44] No. Please don't say that. Please join us.
[02:50] Falak?
[02:52] What is it? It doesn't look good. We'll have lunch together to celebrate the occasion. Come please.
[03:00] Of course. If I had time, I would have joined you.
[03:04] As far as Nawal's promotion is concerned, its the fruit of her hard work.
[03:09] She worked hard for this project and she deserved this promotion. Isn't it Nawal?
[03:17] Sir, I try to do everything with my heart.
[03:22] Just keep working like that. Good luck for your future. I'm getting late. See you. Bye.
[03:33] Falak, why did you have to stop him? He's my boss.
[03:37] It doesn't look good. What would he think about me?
[03:40] I was just being courteous. He gave you a promotion and a car. I had to do this.
[03:47] Nobody can make her understand.
[04:21] Why are you sitting here? Come sit outside.
[04:26] Just like that.
[04:29] Mom and I were in the lounge. Come outside.
[04:35] Mom was showing me the jewelry she has chosen for Nawal.
[04:42] Hamza, can I tell you something? You cannot have a relationship based on conditions.
[04:50] Such relationships are very weak.
[04:54] I'm feeling helpless even when I know I'm right.
[05:01] I just cannot explain her what I mean.
[05:05] Because you're only looking at this matter from one angle.
[05:10] Try a different perspective.
Maybe she's right and you're wrong.
[05:19] Sometimes I think that how could such strong relationships end?
[05:29] Now I understand.
[05:32] You're being stubborn and egoistic and denying your love. And ego,
[05:41] Ego eats away at relationships like termite.
[05:45] One of the two partners have to bend. Only then the relationship will work.
[05:54] As flexible as the relationship is, its stronger.
[06:00] Exactly. Please explain this to Nawal.
[06:05] At least you should understand first, Hamza.
[06:09] Listen to me. Look at me. Nawal is a great girl.
[06:14] And you'll not lose her at any cost. Understand?
[06:19] Now get up.
[06:30] Hamza's family came over to make Nawal understand.
[06:34] You should have asked him to make their son understand.
[06:37] They only wanted to talk.
[06:39] They wanted to know why I was upset.
[06:42] Its the same thing. You think Hamza might not have told them anything. Mom, I'm telling you.
[06:48] Sofia aunty and her daughter knew everything but the thing is how would they find their son is wrong.
[06:56] That's why they came here to talk to you because you'd agree to everything they say.
[07:02] They're worried like us.
[07:05] Mom the boy's side is never worried. The girl's family is always worried.
[07:10] She already has a broken engagement and if this happens again,
[07:15] people will start talking. Nobody will say anything to the boy but everybody will say the girl is at fault.
[07:23] She said she'd talk to Hamza.
[07:26] You should write it down. Rather than making Hamza understand, she'll come here again and make Nawal resign.
[07:33] These rich people have no feelings for others.
[07:37] Nawal, you shouldn't be pressurize. Do whatever you want.
[07:42] Hamza is educated and yet telling you to call off the wedding. This isn't done.
[07:50] Falak. Stop it. Nawal is already upset. Don't upset her anymore.
[07:55] I'm just saying.
[07:57] Nawal should not back out from what her right is.
[08:02] You'll see. He'll fall to his feet.
[08:05] Enough Falak. Nawal get up. Go rest in your room.
[08:12] Mom, let me talk.
[08:14] No mom. Falak is right.
[08:17] I'm not a kid that doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
[08:22] Hamza misbehaved with me. He's wrong.
[08:27] Both of you didn't even mention it. You should have told me this.
[08:32] Some matters will settle with time, peacefully.
[08:39] Both of you shouldn't worry. Everything will be alright. If God wills.
[08:47] Falak, go and rest in your room. Its late at night. You shouldn't stay up so long.
[09:11] Alright. Give it to the manager
[09:20] Hamza?
[09:22] Falak, you?
[09:26] Yes I was passing by. I thought I'd see you.
[09:32] Will you not ask me to sit?
[09:34] Oh sorry. Please sit.
[09:39] How did you find the address of the office?
[09:41] Actually I called your main office and they said you were here.
[09:47] I was close by so I thought I'd meet you.
[09:50] I'm surprised to see you here.
[09:53] What will you have? Tea or coffee?
[09:55] No thank you. I was at mom's place so she told me that your family had come yesterday.
[10:05] Hamza saying no to the wedding, you're being mean to Nawal.
[10:10] If she isn't listening to you, you should stop being stubborn.
[10:13] Do you know how much she's hurt with all this?
[10:17] You're wrong.
[10:19] Falak its not about her resignation. I'm just tired of trying to explain her.
[10:27] She doesn't understand that Shirazi is a very clever man and he's using her against me.
[10:35] You have a misunderstanding. Mr. Shirazi is a very nice, polite man.
[10:41] In fact I've met him personally and he doesn't seem so.
[10:45] You, met him personally? When and why?
[10:51] We were on lunch yesterday. Mom, I, Nawal and him.
[11:00] But Hamza sorry to say, meeting him didn't give me such vibes.
[11:04] Nothing at all. In fact he seemed like a gentleman. Very sensible.
[11:14] You people had lunch with that man?
[11:21] By the way, who invited him for lunch?
[11:26] Of course, Nawal.
[11:29] He is such a nice man. He has done so much.
[11:32] He promoted Nawal and gave her a double package.
[11:36] We're not so ungrateful. We could have given him a lunch.
[11:42] Please don't tell Nawal that I told you everything. She'll be upset with me.
[11:48] I shouldn't have mentioned this to you.
[11:52] I don't know how and why I said this. You people are already in a mess. I'm so sorry.
[11:58] Falak, don't worry
[12:01] I was here to help you finish all misunderstandings between you and Nawal.
[12:08] Shirazi or somebody else.
[12:12] What can I say? I'll just tell you that I love Nawal very much.
[12:17] I cannot see her get hurt. I'll tell you to please think about it once.
[12:25] Its not her fault. Please don't treat her this way.
[12:29] Don't say no to the wedding. What else can I say? Its your decision.
[12:39] Alright, I'll take your leave now. It was good talking to you.
[12:44] Bye.
[13:19] greetings!*
[13:21] Whats happening?
Nothing..
[13:31] Falak, why is this bag here?
[13:42] I had free time so I thought I'd pack. I'm going to mom's.
[13:47] You're going back? You just came back in the morning?
[13:50] Whats wrong Kabeer? Its my sister's wedding. Mom needs me.
[13:55] I just packed a few necessary things.
[13:59] Okay.
[14:13] I was at mom's. She told me your family had visited.
[14:18] You're being mean to Nawal by saying no to the wedding.
[14:22] If she isn't listening to you, you should listen to her. You know how much this is hurting her?
[14:31] Mr. Shirazi is a very polite man.
[14:34] We had lunch together yesterday. Mom, I, Nawal and Mr. Shirazi.
[15:00] Falak?
[15:04] Falak?
[15:10] Falak?
[15:19] Falak?
[15:26] Sir, should I get you some tea?
No. Thanks. Where is Falak?
[15:30] She went outside.
[15:32] Outside? Alright. You go.
[15:53] When you read this letter, I would have flown for Dubai.
[15:59] Please don't mind. Its about my career.
[16:09] My sister is getting married. Mom would need me. I thought I'd pack a few things. She might need them.
[16:33] My head is hurting. This boy has put us in so much stress.
[16:40] It is worrying us, mom. Hamza isn't ready to listen.
[16:46] If this carries on, this matter will get worse.
[16:50] And Nawal? Nawal is right. We cannot force her.
[16:57] But we'll have to do something.
[17:00] We cannot sit idle. How else will we solve this problem?
[17:04] Mom..
[17:05] Can it be done, that you talk to Sultana aunty and postpone the wedding date?
[17:11] Until Nawal and Hamza sort things out. We cannot have the wedding.
[17:17] What are you saying? How will I tell them that?
[17:21] My son isn't in a good mood and I want to cancel the wedding and we'll only have the wedding when he's in a good mood.
[17:28] It is their humility that they aren't saying anything or else people would have said no.
[17:32] No. Mom. Don't say that please.
[17:35] I'm very anxious. I just talked to Raheel. Their tickets would be confirmed in a few days.
[17:43] What will I tell Raheel and my in laws?
[17:47] You know mom how much they talk.
If only Hamza cared one bit.
[17:53] Nazish, you talk to Hamza. Maybe he'll listen to you.
[17:58] If he continues to be stubborn, the peace of my house will be destroyed.
[18:04] I tried.
[18:07] But his silence is worrying me.
[18:13] I know that even he himself isn't at peace.
[18:18] What will we do with his worries? We're losing blood here.
[18:30] If I could, I'd slap him and settle everything.
[18:43] Whats wrong with you? You had this chance. You should have called him and talked.
[18:47] I talk? Why?
[18:50] I'm upset with him. He insulted me. He doesn't even realize.
[18:54] You go and tell him. I'll not talk. What does he think of himself?
[19:25] Kabeer? Where is Falak? Call her.
[19:29] I was thinking we'd go shopping for Nawal's wedding presents since you're home as well.
[19:38] Aaliya, actually,
[19:41] Falak isn't home.
Really? She isn't home? Where did she go?
[19:48] She went to Dubai for two days.
[19:52] What? Without informing?
[19:56] All of a sudden? When did she go?
[20:01] She had a flight at 2pm in the afternoon today.
[20:04] And you're telling us right now?
[20:08] Who dropped her at the airport?
[20:12] She went with the driver.
[20:14] What? She went with the driver and you let her go? What do you do Kabeer?
[20:20] You know her condition doesn't allow her to go.
[20:25] I know but what could I do? She was insisting. She had a plan with her friends.
[20:32] I was forced to let her go. I was scared what if she got sick again.
[20:39] Kabeer I don't understand what you're doing.
[20:43] If she's stupid, you're sensible.
[20:46] Touqeer is right. Friends outing plan could have been postponed.
[20:55] Kabeer, you should take responsibility. I must say this.
[21:00] If Falak doesn't care for herself and her unborn child,
[21:04] then you should have been careful. You should have tried to stop her.
[21:09] If you couldn't you should have asked me. I would have talked to her.
[21:12] You don't know. I have to say again. She needs care in this condition.
[21:18] Whats done is done. We cannot change anything.
[21:23] I've tried to explain her to be careful.
[21:26] And if you want to go to shop for gifts, I'll go with you.
[21:30] No its okay. Let Falak be back, we'll go with her. There's no rush.
[21:41] I'm going out for a while. Fresh air.
Yes, sure.
[21:47] What happened?
I don't know. Weird. They're not kids.
[22:10] Nawal? Come. Lets have dinner together. I made your favorite dishes.
[22:19] Mom, I'm not hungry. Please eat.
[22:24] Dear,
[22:27] How long will you stay like this? You didn't even eat anything for lunch.
[22:31] I know when you're worried, you don't get hungry but you cannot live on an empty stomach.
[22:39] Mom, my head hurts. Let me rest. If you're hungry, please eat. I'll eat when I'm hungry.
[22:51] Alright fine. But do eat, please.
[23:23] Hello? Hie, how are you?
[23:28] Actually I wanted to discuss something important with you.
[23:51] But if Kabeer has no objections, what can we do?
[23:56] Aaliya, at least we should talk.
[23:59] Toqueer please.
[24:06] You will not talk to Kabeer. He seemed very upset. God knows what the two of them discussed. 
[24:13] We don't know what Falak told him to make him agree.
[24:16] Now if you talk to him, he'll be more upset. 
[24:20] Its their life. They can do whatever they want. Our interference isn't feasible.
[24:26] Of all people, you're saying this.
[24:30] Yes. I am. I don't want them to have an argument because of us.
[24:37] We already have so many problems. I don't want anything anymore. Let everything be as it is
[24:44] But Aaliya..
[24:44] Leave it. Finish it here.
[24:48]  I was in a mood for coffee. Do you want some?
[24:52] Obviously. Please.
[24:55] Please go and make some. Thanks.
[25:54] Hello?
Kabeer I know you're upset with me but please talk to me. 
[25:59] I've been calling you. You're not answering.
[26:02] If you cared about me being upset. Why would you go?
[26:07] Then you tell me what should I do?
[26:09] I get bored in home all day. I have nothing to do and you people are insisting I leave this as well.
[26:15] Its only for 2 days. I'll be back in two days after the shoot. 
[26:19] Please don't be angry.
[26:22] Falak I told you not to get the shoot done.
[26:26] I can tolerate everything but not this.
[26:29] Kabeer whats wrong with you? I called you to have a good chat and,
[26:34] now you're repeating everything.
[26:36] I'm getting you a flight right now. You're coming back on the next flight.
[26:41] Do you have idea how much embarrassed I was in front of Aaliya and Toqueer?
[26:47]  Its the first time in life I had to lie to them because of you.
[26:51] What did you lie about?
[26:54] That I had allowed you myself.
[26:57] You could have told them the truth.
[26:59] What should have I told them? That you've become bold enough to go without my permission.
[27:07] No more doing as you please. You'll have to listen to me. No more shoots. 
[27:13] You're coming back on the next flight.
But Kabeer.
[27:19] Alright, fine. I'll not shoot if you say. But let me stay here for two days. 
[27:25] I'm happy here. I like it. God knows when I'll get the chance again.
[27:31] Alright. Stay if you want to but you'll not do the shoot.
[27:38] Alright I won't. Trust your Falak. Don't you trust me this much?
[27:43] I told you to come with me. It would have been great if you'd be here. We could have enjoyed.
[27:48] If you wanted me to be with you, you wouldn't have gone.
[27:54] Oh well. I have a headache. I'm going to bed. Bye.
[28:04] He cannot see me happy.
[28:09] Kabeer did you talk to Falak? How is she?
[28:13] I did. She's fine.
See Toqueer is very upset.
[28:20] Falak went away like this but I tried to make him understand. 
[28:24] If he says something to you, please don't mind. He's very angry.
[28:28] No. What are you saying? Why will I mind what he says?
[28:34] Once Falak is back, make her understand. I hope she'll understand.
[28:39] Don't worry. I'll make her understand. She won't do this again.
[28:42] Alright. Where are you going?
I have some work.
[28:45] Alright, I have some work too. See you later.
[29:02] Hamza? Does it really not make a difference if you don't marry Nawal?
[29:09] It does make a difference. Why won't it? Why are you asking?
[29:13] Because I've never seen anyone as peaceful as you if they're losing their love.
[29:24] I met Nawal.
[29:28]  I saw her worried and tears in her eyes.
[29:32] I think I don't know how to express my emotions so well.
[29:38] Sultana aunty came today. She was worried.
[29:47] She had tears in her eyes. She's the mother of a daughter and she can see,
[29:55] she will have to answer a hundred people if you call off the wedding. 
[29:59] She'll have to testify there's no fault with her daughter. 
[30:04] She said,
[30:07] nobody will ask you or say anything to you. 
[30:14] She was right. We're the groom's side.
[30:19] Nobody will dare point a finger at us. 
[30:23] Everybody will always blame the girl's family.
[30:29] That's why you're relaxed.
But why are you telling me all this?
[30:33] So that you realize it as well.
[30:36]  Mom is worried because of you. She's very hurt, Hamza.
[30:41] Calling off the wedding isn't a small thing. 
[30:45] It will ridicule two families. Why don't you understand this?
[30:50] Try to understand this
[30:52] .
I'm not calling off the wedding. Why doesn't anybody ask Nawal? I'm her husband to be.
[30:59] If I'm saying something, she should listen to me. Why is she being stubborn? 
[31:03] Her attitude shows her office is more important for her, than me.
[31:09] Hamza, I'm not here to argue. I just want to say, please don't put mom through a test.
[31:18] Okay fine. Now tell me what to do?
[31:24] Meet Nawal and sit together to sort it out, Hamza. 
[31:30] Your attitude is hurting everyone, Hamza.
[32:29] Nawal? Should I tell you something?
[32:36]  Listen to Hamza.
[32:43] You're asking me to listen to him?
[32:46] Yes dear. 
[32:51] What we think is the purpose of our life.. 
[32:55] success, job, money, we find all this in our life someday.
[33:04] If you don't find, you don't find true love. 
[33:08] There is a replacement for everything, my dear. But not human beings.
[33:15] But Hamza should realize this.
[33:19]  He should know what makes me happy, what I like or dislike.
[33:24] If he isn't backing down, then you should. 
[33:29] After all, its the woman who has to agree in the end.
[33:34]  Or put it that way. To save your relationships,
[33:40] one of the two parties has to sacrifice
[33:45]  and God has made woman more flexible than men.
[33:51] Mom, I'm missing dad a lot today.
[36:04] Congratulations everyone.
Congratulations to you as well.
[36:09] Mr. Shirazi, congratulations!
thank you.
[36:17] Mr. Shirazi, lunch is ready for you.
[36:20] Why did you have to be so formal?
[36:23] We're partners now. We'll keep on treating you with this formality.
[36:28]  Please. Will you join us Aaliya?
Farhan?
[36:34] Yes mam?
[36:35] I want all these pictures on social media right away.
[36:39]  I want everyone to know that there's a deal between Kabeer Foods and Shirazi and Co.
[36:44] Okay. Yes mam.
Please forward these.
[37:01] Call Mr. Kabeer and tell him we have a meeting at 5pm today. And listen. No excuses.
[37:51] Such urgent meeting? Is everything alright?
Come sit.
[38:04] I saw a few pictures of you with Shirazi and Group.
[38:09]  I don't believe you could do this.
[38:12] What do you mean?
[38:14] We're partners and you signed a deal with them without asking me.
[38:20] You didn't even ask me or better yet, tell me.
[38:24] Hamza this was Aaliya's decision.
[38:27] She wanted to not disclose the deal until it was finalized.
[38:31] Alright.
[38:34] Cancel it.
[38:35] What? Hamza you know very well, I cannot do this. I need this deal.
[38:44] Alright. If you don't cancel this deal, we cannot be friends anymore.
[38:53] And neither our partnership. I'm canceling our deal.
[38:58] What are you saying Hamza? You cannot do this.
[39:01] Do you even realize how much loss we'll incur.
[39:04] I know. That's why I have thought this decision through
[39:12] Hamza, you're my friend. If not for your business, then for our friendship at least. 
[39:17] We've invested millions, Hamza.
[39:20] If we back down from this project, and that too at this hour. 
[39:23] Please Hamza, I request you. 
[39:26] If you have a problem with terms and conditions, we can sit and talk.
[39:31] But please, let the project run, don't stop it. We'll incur a big loss.
[39:37] I have no problem with the terms or conditions. I just have a problem with Shirazi.
[39:42] If you want our deal and our friendship to stay, call off the deal with Shirazi.
[39:49] Hamza try to understand. We're helpless without the deal with Shirazi.
[39:54] I've told you my condition. Its up to you now. 
[39:59] If you will keep the deal with Shirazi, I cannot work with you. 
[40:05] This is my final decision.
