[00:51] How would you reject me? I reject you!
[00:55] I am refusing to marry you
[01:13] This is what you wanted?
[01:15] You wanted to be separated from me.
[01:20] Go. I've done that for you.
[01:28] Stay with him now.
[02:20] Hamza? Hamza?
[02:36] Nazish? Did you see Hamza?
[02:38] No. What happened?
[02:40] Why do you look so worried?
[02:42] He left in the morning. He isn't back yet.
[02:44] Call him.
[02:47] I did call him but his phone is switched off.
[02:50] Okay. The number is off. Don't worry, he isn't a child mom.
[02:56] Maybe he stayed back because of a meeting.
[02:59] He'll be back in a bit.
[03:04] I'm going to make coffee for myself. Will you have it?
[03:08] Yes.
Alright. Go rest in your room. I'll bring your coffee in two minutes.
[03:14] Okay. Just...
[03:17] What just happened? Hamza ended everything and left.
[03:22] Nawal, he must be mistaken.
[03:24] he will understand If you explain it to him.
[03:26] He didn't even listen to me. He talked such trash.. Falak..
[03:31] Where were you?
What happened? I was in the lawn.
[03:35] I checked the lawn just now, you were not there. Tell me the truth, where were you.
[03:40] You called Hamza, didn't you?
[03:42] Hamza? What are you saying?
[03:44] Falak, tell me the truth. Did you call Hamza?
[03:49] Whats wrong? Why are you saying this? I just said I was in the lawn with Ilham. Ask the servants.
[03:56] Nawal, she called Hamza here and now she's lying.
[04:02] I found it intriguing the moment Hamza came here at this hour.
[04:05] Kabeer are you in your senses? I don't want to talk to you.
[04:08] sister Nawal, tell him how I was pining to meet Ilham.
[04:13] I was pining for her. Why would I do this?
[04:15] But if you didn't call Hamza here, who did, Falak?
[04:20] How would I know? I told you I was in the lawn..
[04:27] No matter how much Nawal trusts you.
[04:29] But I don't trust you at all.
[04:32] You called Hamza here otherwise he would never get the revelation that Nawal was here right now.
[04:41] Give me your phone.
[04:46] Why should I give you my phone? Who are you to talk to me like this and accuse me falsely?
[04:52] Only those who lie, they scream.
[04:55] If you aren't lying, give me your phone. I'll check.
[05:00] Why should I show you my phone? He planned all this so that I cannot meet my daughter.
[05:07] And he is now accusing me because of this. I didn't do anything.
[05:11] I was stupid I came here at this hour.
[05:13] Didn't I tell you he wouldn't let me meet my daughter?
[05:17] You left her here yourself.
[05:19] And you said yourself that you didn't want anything to do with Ilham.
[05:22] You wrote this on a legal document. What love are you showing now, Falak?
[05:29] Give me. Leave her.
[05:33] I'm her mother and you cannot take away my right to meet her. I'll see all of you.
[05:38] Come Nawal.. Lets leave.
Here..
[05:52] Don't worry. Sit here.
[06:08] I don't understand. Hamza came there?
[06:14] He said no to marrying you.
[06:16] He didn't ask or clarify anything and announced his decision?
[06:22] How can he do this?
[06:24] Falak he thinks I'm involved with Kabeer.
[06:28] We have an affair. He thought I was lying to him.
[06:32] Then you should have talked to him and make him understand.
[06:37] Falak he was so wary of me, he didn't even trust a thing I said.
[06:42] You tell me, can I do this?
[06:45] No. You can never do such a thing.
[06:49] But, whats surprising is how did Hamza reach there?
[06:54] Who told him you were at Kabeer's house.
[07:00] Even if you believe me or not, its Kabeer's doing. Who else could do this?
[07:09] What would Kabeer do such a thing?
[07:13] What do you mean? If you marry Hamza, he thinks you'll pull out your investment from his business.
[07:20] And he'll be on the road again. He doesn't want this to happen
[07:24] and he got another chance today.
[07:26] He will not let me meet my daughter. Who'll get the most benefits out of this, Kabeer?
[07:30] neither he will let me meet Ilhaam, nor he will loose his investment.
[07:34] He killed two deers with one arrow.
[07:36] He had your break up with Hamza and now he'll not let me meet my daughter.
[07:43] No Falak.
[07:45] Kabeer isn't like that. I completely believe he hasn't done this.
[07:51] So you think I called Hamza there?
[07:54] You will trust Kabeer as well? How can you do that to me..
[07:59] No Falak, you're my sister. I know very well you'll never do this to me.
[08:08] So if we believe Hamza came there as a coincidence.
[08:13] Whatever it is, its our loss. What did Kabeer and Hamza lose? Nothing!
[08:20] Neither would Hamza come here and break up with you and now I'll not be able to meet my daughter.
[08:26] Kabeer will never let me meet her after this.
[08:29] Why do you worry Falak? Nobody will stop you.
[08:35] I don't want to stay away from my daughter.
[08:37] Nobody will do that. Whats wrong with you? Relax.
[09:05] Hamza.. you?
[09:33] What did the two of you think that I'll never know whats going on between you two?
[09:37] Hamza, mind yourself.
[09:38] What should I mind? You're a cheap man.
[09:42] Aren't you ashamed to have an affair with your ex wife's sister?
[10:00] Enough Hamza. I'll kill you if you say another word.
Hamza...
[10:05] You're mistaken. Its not what you think. I brought Falak here. She wanted to meet Ilham..
[10:22] I always thought why did you favor this man so much?
[10:27] You kept on deceiving me and I kept on being fooled.
[10:34] You wanted to be separated from me. I'm doing it for you.
[10:39] Live with him now.
[11:07] So I've passed the first level. The wall is down now.
[11:11] The relationship is over. You have no match, Falak.
[11:15] You made a fool proof plan. Trust me, you're very clever.
[11:22] Nobody found out that it was I who called.
[11:27] Nobody can stop Hamza from being mine, now.
[11:42] I don't know what this boy is doing. He left yesterday morning and didn't even come home last night. I don't know..
[11:49] Mom, don't worry. Please pray he'll be fine.
[11:54] Do one thing. Call his friends. Let me find out where this boy is.
[11:58] Mom, I don't have the number of any of his friends.
[12:02] Alright, I'll call.
Where is my phone?! Where is it?! Hamza..
[12:08] Hamza! Where were you? I was so worried.
[12:14] I was with a friend.
[12:15] Do you even realize how worried mom and I were?
[12:19] With a friend? You could have called. Your number was switched off.
[12:26] I didn't think of it.
[12:28] Dear, what are you hiding from us?
[12:33] I'm very tired. I'm going to sleep. Nobody disturbs me.
[12:42] There's some problem.
[12:59] Didn't Hamza come to the office today?
[13:01] No. He isn't well so he didn't come to the office today.
[13:15] He took it to his heart. He would. He's been in love for years with her.
[13:25] This is the chance. The wound is fresh. I can do what I want.
[13:30] Otherwise what if they clear their misunderstandings.
[14:22] Hello Kabeer.
[14:24] Nawal, are you okay?
[14:28] Why, what would happen to me?
[14:32] Nawal, trust me. I didn't call Hamza.
[14:37] Kabeer please I know you cannot do such a cheap thing.
[14:43] I believe this is Falak.
[14:46] She did all this.
[14:49] She took Ilham outside and then she called Hamza.
[14:55] She knew we were in the lounge.
[14:58] Nawal think about it yourself? Why would she just miss Ilham, all of a sudden?
[15:05] Kabeer I don't want to think about it.
[15:11] In fact I have no complaints from anyone. If I have a complaint, I have one with Hamza.
[15:16] He knows me.
[15:19] And yet he accused me of cheating. He accused my character.
[15:25] Nawal he has a misunderstanding.
[15:28] Talk to him and make him understand that we have nothing like that going on.
[15:32] You know Kabeer, if we claim that we love someone,
[15:38] this means that it is a deep connection.
[15:41] We know that person very well.
[15:45] But even after such a deep connection we have to give clarifications,
[15:50] then it isn't love.
[15:52] This is a temporary connection
[15:56] and if such connections break, it makes no difference.
[16:05] Bye.
[16:28] Hamza, trust me.
[16:31] I didn't call you with a wrong motive. Had I known this would happen,
[16:38] that you'd call off your engagement, I'd never call you.
[16:42] I called you to come and make Nawal understand. Tell her that she shouldn't meet Kabeer.
[16:50] But what did you do, Hamza.
[16:53] What else could I do? You know everything.
[16:57] I tried to make Nawal understand so many times but she never listened to me.
[17:03] What else could I do?
[17:05] I didn't have a choice.
You're right.
[17:11] Even if you'd have told her, she would never listen.
[17:16] Once you're spoiled, you never get back.
[17:26] I was so worried all night. I couldn't sleep all night. I was thinking you'd think
[17:31] why I did such a thing but Hamza, trust me,
[17:36] my intentions weren't wrong.
[17:39] I'm thankful to you. You opened my eyes.
[17:44] I would have been fooled all my life.
[17:47] Thank God we found out about their affair. If we wouldn't know,
[17:53] they would have done the same, all life. Even after you got married.
[18:00] That's what I'm saying.
[18:01] Think about me. Its my own sister who destroyed my house.
[18:08] I'm going through so much pain. I believe it 100% now.
[18:13] Its Nawal who turned Kabeer against me.
[18:17] That's why he divorced me in anger and finished everything.
[18:22] It was all Nawal's doing. I couldn't understand.
[18:26] We thought we were very sensible. Very clever
[18:30] and yet they had an affair under our nose and we didn't know.
[18:36] We're so stupid.
[18:38] This is the problem.
[18:41] Loyal people are often deceived.
[18:46] What have you thought now?
[18:50] Nothing.
[18:53] To be honest, I don't understand.
[18:56] The girl I loved all my life, she'd turn out to be so small, I never thought about it.
[19:05] Did you tell aunty?
[19:08] No.
[19:14] You'll have to tell her.
[19:17] She supports Nawal so much. She thinks she's the best.
[19:21] She will never accept your decision.
[19:24] Because she doesn't know Nawal's truth.
[19:28] She will know. Its my life.
[19:32] And the decision that's best for my life, I'll do that.
[19:37] My family have to accept it.
[19:40] If aunty doesn't accept your decision.
[19:43] If she doesn't listen to you and insists that you marry Nawal, what will you do?
[19:50] Nobody can force me.
[19:52] I take my decisions myself.
[20:35] I don't know but I feel Hamza is hiding something from us.
[20:40] Yeah, he's behaving so weird.
[20:42] Mom?
Yes?
[20:45] I want to talk to you.
Yes, tell me.
[20:50] I've decided that I'll not marry Nawal.
[20:55] What? What are you saying, Hamza?
[20:57] Don't worry too much.
[21:01] You're reacting as if I said something out of the world.
[21:05] This is out of the world, Hamza.
[21:08] I don't understand whats the problem between you two.
[21:16] I've said what I wanted to say.
[21:20] Both of you will drive us mad. Is this how relationships are made? This isn't done.
[21:26] When they're agreeable, you say yes and when you're upset, you say no. Is this how its done?
[21:31] Then you tell me how its done?
[21:35] If there is a misunderstanding in a relationship, people sit and talk and find a solution.
[21:45] See Hamza, whatever it is, tell us. Mom and I will talk to Nawal.
[21:51] There's no use of explaining her now.
[21:54] I've broken all my connections to Nawal.
[21:58] And yes, both of you will not go to her house after today and neither will you talk.
[22:13] What is this? He just orders and leaves. He'll kill me one day. This isn't how its done.
[22:22] Mom, please don't worry. I'll talk to him.
[22:29] Nawal?
[22:33] The maid told me you didn't eat so I brought dinner myself.
[22:38] I'm not in the mood.
[22:41] I will make my sister eat myself. Come on.
[22:44] Keep it here, I'll eat myself in a bit.
[22:52] Nawal, I know Hamza didn't do good with you. He accused your character.
[23:00] He called off the engagement. He shouldn't have done it.
[23:11] I believe Sofia aunty will come and make you understand and pressurize you to agree for the wedding.
[23:21] But no matter what she says, she cannot mend this relationship.
[23:24] When her son called off the relationship, whats left.
[23:29] You don't have to compromise on your self respect.
[23:33] How dare he call you a cheater? Had I been in your place,
[23:37] I would never even see the face of that man, leave alone marry him.
[23:41] How dare he say such a thing? Doesn't he know you?
[23:46] And what does Hamza think? If he leaves you will you stop living? Will you keep crying for him and end everything?
[23:54] No Nawal. This relationship ending shouldn't make a difference to you.
[23:58] Also you'll not kill yourself.
[24:02] You'll do what you've been doing. Take care of your responsibilities.
[24:07] Go to your office and do what you've been doing. Crying here will get you nothing.
[24:11] This way he'll feel that he's won and he was right. Do you understand?
[24:19] And as it is, you shouldn't run behind a man whose running away from you.
[24:29] You're right.
[24:39] We can live without love, Nawal but not without respect.
[24:48] You've become so sensible, I didn't realize that.
[24:56] Life's sufferings have taught me everything.
[24:59] I've lost everything in my life. I had to be sensible now.
[25:09] Well leave everything and eat. I brought this with so much love. Promise me you'll eat.
[25:17] Okay.
[25:24] A person shouldn't be so stupid.
[25:36] I don't believe it. Hamza could do all this?
[25:41] Dear, its your fault as well.
[25:46] When Hamza told you that he doesn't like Kabeer, you shouldn't have gone to his house.
[25:52] Aunty I took Falak. She wanted to meet Ilham, she was pining for her. Tell me what could I do?
[25:58] But the point is who told Hamza?
[26:04] I don't know.
[26:09] Listen, Hamza said everything because he was angry.
[26:14] Don't take it to your heart.
Not take it to my heart?
[26:18] He accused my character.
[26:21] He accused me that I'm involved with Kabeer. Do you think I'm like that?
[26:33] I'm hurting because Hamza knows me well.
[26:39] How could he think that I'd deceive him?
[26:43] That I could stoop so low.
[26:46] He mistrusted me and made me fall in my own eyes.
[26:52] You'll see Nawal, he'll realize it himself in a few days and he'll come to apologize to you.
[26:59] But his apology will not wash the stain he put on my character.
[27:03] When there is doubt in a relationship, everything goes away.
[27:07] See Nawal..
[27:09] You're angry right now. When you have calmed down in a few days, mom and I will come again.
[27:15] I can tolerate misbehavior.
[27:18] But I cannot tolerate someone pointing a finger at my character. 
[27:24] and I cannot marry a man who doesn't trust me.
[27:29] Dear, ups and downs are a part of relationships. You're taking it too personally.
[27:50] If you had made her understand, she wouldn't have listened anyways. 
[27:53] Once spoiled, always spoiled.
[27:58] Thank God we found about their affair. 
[28:01] Had we not known, they would have been together, all their life. Even after the wedding.
[28:32] Hamza.. Mom and I went to see Nawal.
[28:37] I told you not to go.
[28:41] Hamza, its your fault because you saw Kabeer and Nawal together and accused them.
[28:48] Yes.
[28:49] Because I know very well that Nawal is cheating on me.
[28:53] Do you have a proof for this?
[28:58] Why doesn't she value anything I say? Why does she care about Kabeer?
[29:03]  Why did she go to his house when I told her not to?
[29:07] Why did she invest in his company? 
[29:11] Why does she favor him? 
[29:14] Do you have an answer to all this?
[29:17] Do you know why someone favors a person?
[29:20]  Because they are involved with the heart.
[29:24] This isn't proof but misunderstandings, Hamza. 
[29:27] Listen to me once.
I don't want to listen to you.
[29:33] I've already decided. I'm not marrying Nawal. That's it.
[30:03] How are you?
[30:04] I'm fine. Tell me how are you? How is brother Toqueer and Hafsa? Has Hafsa settled there?
[30:11] Everything is fine here. Hafsa misses everyone. 
[30:15] She asks me everyday when we're going back. She's missing Ilham especially.
[30:24] Kabeer, I talked to the maid and she told me Falak came to the house.
[30:32] She came to meet Ilham.
[30:35] Nawal asked me so I didn't say no.
[30:37] And Hamza, why did he come?
[30:41] I found out that he came home and misbehaved with you and Nawal. He said a lot of things.
[30:50] Yes, he was mistaken.
[30:53] Mistaken?
[30:56] He came to our house and accused yours and Nawal's character?
[31:03] How dare he come to our house and misbehave so much? 
[31:07] Why didn't you call the police and have him thrown out?
[31:11] I didn't know he was coming to our house.
[31:15] And had I involved the police, things would have gone worse that's why I didn't call the police.
[31:19] And how did he know Nawal was at our house?
[31:24] Falak must have called him. Nobody else knew Nawal was at our house.
[31:30] You're right. Only Falak could call. 
[31:34] Her hypocrisy knows no bounds. And Hamza?
[31:37] Is he crazy?
[31:39] Yes, consider him crazy only. 
[31:42] Had he been sensible, would he accuse her this way?
[31:45] I don't understand that how such a kind hearted girl like Nawal will live with such a dubious man?
[31:58] And Toqueer found out. He was very upset.
[32:03] Why did you tell him?
[32:06] I was talking and he heard. 
[32:09] He said that Kabeer should find an FIR against him.
[32:14] See, I don't want to be involved in any such mess.
[32:18] Nawal will be dragged without a reason. She's already worried. 
[32:22] She'll be more worried. Tell brother Toqueer he shouldn't worry at all.
[32:29] By the way, I'm leaving for something very important. 
[32:33] Pay my regards to my brother.
Alright. Bye.
[32:37] Bye.
[32:55] Hamza?
[33:02] What happened Hamza? Why are you so upset?
[33:07] It seems you didn't sleep all night. 
[33:10] Your eyes are so red.
[33:14] Actually, I'm not well. I couldn't sleep at night.
[33:24] I feel guilty looking at your condition. 
[33:28] If only I hadn't told you about sister Nawal and Kabeer.
[33:37] If I could I'd take away all your pains away. I'll never let a tear come in your eyes.
[33:47] I feel this pain. Because the pain you feel, is similar to what I feel.
[33:55] I can only say that don't hurt yourself for people who don't care for us.
[34:06] Why are you burning up because of it?
[34:09] My trust is broken,
[34:14] it is bound to hurt.
[34:20] I feel helpless.
[34:25] I just want to wind up everything and shift abroad.
[34:32] What are you saying Hamza?
[34:35]  Will you punish yourself on her disloyalty? Will you leave the country and go?
[34:39] Your business, all this setup, what will become of it?
[34:45] This means you've accepted defeat.
[34:53] I've lost heart.
[34:57] I don't want to stay here.
[35:07] I feel irritated.
[35:13] Hamza, 
[35:16] look at your condition and then look at sister Nawal. 
[35:20] it didn't made any difference to her, She wakes up everyday and goes to her office regularly.
[35:25] The girl who has a life partner like you, what else will she need from life?
[35:34] But she.. she's very happy. Happier than ever.
[35:41] Looking at her, it doesn't seem her engagement was broken off recently.
[35:46] She has become completely indifferent.
[35:49] Hamza, if it didn't bother Nawal, it shouldn't bother you. And... 
[35:57] As it is, one sided love will only give you pain and nothing else.
[36:04] And the sooner it ends, the better. 
[36:08] I'd say you should stay here and show Nawal.
[36:11] That you're very happy in your life. She should realize.
[36:18] What she lost?
[36:26] I think you haven't eaten anything since last night. 
[36:29] Come with me. I'll take you for good coffee and a good breakfast.
[36:34] No Falak, I'm not in the mood.
[36:36] Come on get up Hamza. I know a good place. I'll get you good coffee and breakfast.
[36:42] Okay.
[36:45] Hamza, the relationships that become wounds, you should be happy they're over, not sad.
[36:53] Lets go. Come on.
[37:41] Yes, this is a good deal. We'll see what to do.
[37:45] Kabeer, isn't this your ex-wife Falak?
[38:04] What is she doing with Hamza?
[38:10] Leave it. Lets go.
[38:22] Hamza, should I say something?
[38:29] Like you couldn't bear Nawal's betrayal,
[38:33]  I couldn't bear Kabeer's betrayal.
[38:38] I'm surprised that my own sister destroyed my own house. 
[38:44] Its because of her, I got divorced.
[38:49] You got hurt and you ended the relationship. 
[38:54] Think about me.
[38:57] Nobody can realize how much pain I'm in. I live in the same house as her.
[39:04] I have to see her face every time and I'll have to listen to her taunt me and
[39:10]  look at how helpless I am. I cannot answer her back.
[39:17] Don't worry. Just wait a little. 
[39:22] I'll arrange a good flat for you. You can shift there.
