[00:12] Falak, are you asking me to leave this house?
[00:15] Yes... it's better for you.
[00:18] Because it will be very hard for you to live here until you transfer that land to me.
[00:26] He's not a director or a producer. He has taken money from so many people.
[00:36] If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have endured this loss.
[00:39] This all happened because of you.
[00:42] You looked at me enviously and now all of it is ruined.
[00:57] Did you sign an agreement with him?
[01:01] No, the papers were being prepared.
[01:04] You gave him such a huge sum without an agreement?
[01:10] Maria is all of our friend.
[01:12] It never occurred to us that she could commit fraud.
[01:16] One can't trust one's family nowadays...
[01:19] and you trusted your friend, someone you just befriended a few months ago.
[01:25] That's what I'm saying.
[01:28] How can you trust someone so blindly?
[01:32] I would have understood if it was a sum like ten lacs, but this is four crores...
[01:36] You chose to give him the money... you don't have proof or any witnesses, how can we catch him like this?
[01:45] Does this concern blackmail?
[01:48] No, it's nothing like that.
[01:51] Maria wanted me to meet Shuja.
[01:56] As soon as we met, he talked about a serial. They wanted to cast me in a serial.
[02:02] We couldn't agree so we decided to produce a film.
[02:09] He wanted to cast me as a lead. I thought that it would be a good investment.
[02:14] How could I've known that they would steal my money?
[02:18] People like that are very professional.
[02:21] They target foolish and emotional people. People who can fall victim to their words easily.
[02:27] Such seems to be your case.
[02:29] We can't change what happened, now tell me...
[02:33] Can we do something about this?
[02:36] It's very hard, but I'll try my best.
[02:41] Please... because she is very worried.
[02:45] I'll try my best,
[02:57] Falak, control yourself.
[02:59] My entire life's work has been stolen.
[03:04] Do you know how worried I am?
[03:06] On top of that sister Niwal has made my life hell by taunting me.
[03:11] I realize that you need not worry.
[03:16] It's four crore rupees, it might be nothing to you, but to me it's a large amount.
[03:24] Tell me, did you file a report with the police?
[03:27] I have, but it will make no difference.
[03:29] They said that I chose to give them the money.
[03:33] That's why they can't prove it...
[03:39] that I was a victim of a fraud.
[03:42] I'll do something about it. I'll talk to somebody.
[03:45] What will you do?
I have a few friends in the police...
[03:51] I'll talk to them, let's see what we can do.
[03:56] I'm so troubled. Sister Niwal has told me...
[04:01] that I should leave home. Where will I go?
[04:08] I didn't expect Niwal to behave this way.
[04:13] Stay there until I come back. I'll talk to Niwal when I return.
[04:21] If you need anything let me know.
[04:25] Thank you so much, Hamza.
[04:59] Niwal, are you okay?
[05:02] I just felt dizzy.
[05:05] Have some water quickly.
Sorry...
[05:12] Are you worried about something?
No, I'm not.
[05:17] I'll ask Kabir to take you to the doctor. Please send Kabir here.
[05:25] Honestly, I'll go home, once I rest I'll get better.
[05:32] I'll ask Kabir to drop you home. Have some more...
Thank you.
[05:42] We can't change what happened, there's no point in sitting here like this.
[05:49] What else should I do if not worry?
[05:53] I don't have any other place to live as well.
[05:56] What? You have this home, will you stay here?
[06:04] The house was transferred to sister Niwal, I wanted to move from here.
[06:09] This is what I planned.
What?
[06:12] I'm disappointed in you, you sold the land and then transferred the house to sister Niwal.
[06:23] The way I got the land was by transferring the house to sister Niwal.
[06:29] Listen, think about it...
[06:32] It's a big home, she won't stay here alone.
[06:36] There is no need for you to go anywhere.
[06:39] Talk to your sister affectionately. She's your sister and you know that...
[06:47] sister Niwal has a soft nature if you talk to her affectionately.
[06:53] she won't oust you from here.
[06:57] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[07:13] It seems that my advice did not affect you
[07:22] Where Falak invested the money has been stolen. That man has ran away to Dubai.
[07:31] It was four crore rupees...
[07:35] Really?
[07:36] I want to stay away from this, but she's my sister and I can't ignore her.
[07:42] You tried to make her understand, right?
[07:45] You fulfilled your duties.
[07:48] What can we do if she wants to harm herself?
[07:53] She doesn't care about the loss. I couldn't sleep last night.
[08:00] Don't worry, God will make everything better.
[08:30] What have you decided?
[08:33] Did you talk to someone?
[08:36] Yes...
Do you want to file a report with the police or not?
[08:43] I have.
[08:47] I can't believe that we've endured such a loss.
[08:54] If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have endured this loss today.
[08:59] You have suffered for trusting someone blindly...
[09:05] First, you sold the plot at a lower amount, because you were in a rush and then you gave the entire sum to Maria.
[09:13] I didn't like that girl from the beginning,
[09:16] that's why I asked you not to bring her here.
[09:20] I'm ashamed sister, if only I had listened to you.
[09:27] If I had this wouldn't be happening to me today.
[09:30] Foolish girls like me lose everything...
[09:38] Now, I don't have that plot or a roof over my head.
[09:46] Forgive me, sister... I'm so sorry.
[09:54] Don't worry... we can't change the mistake you made.
[10:02] Allow me a few days... let me stay here for a few more days...
[10:09] I've talked to my friend to find me a single-room apartment.
[10:14] If she isn't able to find one, I'll go to a shelter.
Not at all!
[10:20] This is your home, as much as it is mine.
[10:24] No sister, I have no right over this home.
[10:29] You're the sole owner of this house.
[10:34] It's not mine.
[10:35] You'll stay here and you'll go nowhere. I don't want to hear you say this again.
[10:44] Now eat... here you are.
[10:59] Tawqir, you look tired, are you feeling okay?
[11:03] I'm fine... I'm just burdened by work.
[11:08] I have to handle everything alone that's why...
[11:11] I get so tired. Why don't you hire a staff for yourself?
[11:17] You do your work and let them take care of the rest.
[11:24] I've hired staff, but I have to supervise them, I can't just leave everything to them.
[11:32] I find myself trapped.
[11:36] Meetings... paperwork... visits... I have to handle everything alone.
[11:45] Aliyah, why don't you come here?
[11:50] Me?
Yes... I need help...
[11:54] if you come here my burden will be lessened.
[11:58] Farhan can't come here, so I have to take care of everything.
[12:02] I was thinking that you should come here... it's a new company.
[12:08] All of the people are new and I can't trust anyone.
[12:15] I need you...
You're right...
[12:20] but we have a business and our house here.
[12:24] Now, we have Inham's responsibility as well.
[12:27] If I leave, who will take care of this? It will be a problem for Kabir.
[12:36] I don't think he'll be able to manage business with Inham.
[12:41] Bring Inham here, she can live here as well.
[12:45] This way Hafsa will be engaged with her.
[12:48] Frankly speaking, I was thinking of permanently settling here.
[12:54] After living here for a few weeks I've learned that business will flourish here.
[13:05] I'll talk to Kabir and then let you know.
[13:09] Alright, talk to him, once you talk to him let me know and I'll book the tickets.
[13:17] Alright fine. Take care of yourself.
[13:21] You too... and I miss you.
[13:26] Farewell*
[13:36] Surprise!
Hamza!
[13:41] Oh my God!
How's my baby?
[13:46] My dear, how come you're here?
[13:49] Nazish, see who it is!
Yes, mother?
[13:54] Hamza.... what a pleasant surprise.
Greetings, how are you?
[13:59] Greetings to you. I'm fine. You didn't mention that you were coming.
[14:03] If I had then would I be able to see you guys so happy?
[14:10] You've been away for so long, I missed you.
[14:13] I missed you as well. I brought a lot of gifts for you.
[14:16] I'm sure he must have brought you toys and chocolates...
[14:21] Did you bring chocolates for us as well?
[14:24] Yes I did... and I brought dolls as well.
[14:34] Yes, Mr. Qureshi...
[14:36] No, I just reached out. I'll come to the office tomorrow.
[14:40] Tawqir called... he was worried.
[14:50] He said that he is burdened by work and he can't handle it alone.
[14:57] He asked me to go there.
[15:02] He wanted to take over the managerial post and handle everything.
[15:08] Alright...
[15:11] That's good... if you leave it will lessen the burden on him.
[15:20] Yes but... what about you? How will you take care of everything here alone?
[15:27] I mean... alongside business...
[15:31] there's home... then there's Inham, you have her responsibility as well.
[15:35] Tawqir stated that I should take Inham with me.
[15:42] I did intend on taking her with me, if I left, I couldn't leave her alone.
[15:48] What are you saying?
[15:51] I won't let you leave with Inham.
[15:54] Who else do I have besides her? What will I do without her?
[16:01] I know that you are very emotional for her...
[16:06] She's your daughter and you're attached to her. But right now she's a baby.
[16:12] She needs extreme care and attention. Where will you find the time?
[16:19] You won't be able to take care of her
[16:21] You need not worry about her, she's my responsibility.
[16:25] I will take care of her and will not give you a chance to complain...
[16:33] Try and understand what I'm saying...
[16:37] It's hard to manage a business at home, alone.
[16:42] She's very young, let her leave with me. Focus on your business for now.
[16:48] No sister...
[16:50] If you take Inham, I'll go mad alone.
[16:54] I told you, it would be alright.
[16:57] If you ask me, I'll hire another nanny.
[17:01] I'll put cameras around the house and I'll ask Niwal to visit often.
[17:08] But please let Inham stay here, I promise that I won't let anything happen to her.
[17:18] If you still don't believe me, I'll take Inham with me and take care of her there.
[17:28] But please don't talk about taking Inham away.
[17:33] Trust me, I'll take care of her.
[17:38] Alright...
[17:41] I can't think of taking her away with me.
[17:45] It's obvious, you're her father.
[17:49] But Kabir being a woman...
[17:53] and a mother I would like to tell you...
[17:58] that you will need to take care of Inham better than yourself.
[18:05] I'll take good care of her.
[18:09] More than myself... I promise.
[18:17] Let me check up on her... I think she might be awake.
[18:30] Sit down sir, I'll call her
[18:40] Hamza, when did you get here?
[18:43] Just today.
[18:46] How is your tour?
It went well... I had fun. Where's Niwal.
[18:53] She hasn't come back from work.
[18:57] She's still at work?
She's late every day.
[19:00] Often she stays at the office late.
[19:07] Anyways, what can I say?
[19:10] I have no value, most of her time is spent in the office with Kabir.
[19:19] Or she goes to Kabir's home.
[19:26] If you're asking me to, then Falak can meet my daughter.
thank you!
[19:45] Hamza you?
[19:54] Sit down, why are you standing?
I'm fine.
[20:01] After mother, I feel as though...
[20:05] there's no one to take care of me or ask how I'm doing
[20:09] Sister Niwal treats me like an object with no value.
[20:15] She doesn't care about me at all. She doesn't talk to me.
[20:22] She doesn't care about me.
[20:25] You know I fell victim to a fraud.
[20:29] Maria ran away with my money, and instead of consoling me, she kept taunting me.
[20:36] I wanted to leave my house but tell me...
[20:41] where would I have gone?
[20:44] I have no one... who would have taken care of me...
[20:48] Mother married me early, I didn't get to complete my education as well.
[20:54] If I had a degree I would have found a job, but who will hire me now?
[21:03] Falak, don't worry... come to my office tomorrow,
[21:08] I'll see what I can do.
[21:10] No Hamza, there's no need for that. I don't want to become a burden on you.
[21:16] It's not about becoming a burden.
[21:18] I'm asking you to come to my office tomorrow.
[21:23] If you're insisting so much, then I'll be there.
[21:41] What's the matter? Are you thinking about sister Niwal?
[21:51] I thought that she wouldn't be in contact with Kabir.
[21:56] Contact? She goes to work daily.
[22:00] They never stopped being in contact, even after you asked her not to.
[22:12] Let me tell you the truth. Sister Niwal has invested in Kabir's business.
[22:20] She's a partner now, that's why she doesn't listen to you.
[22:24] What?
[22:26] To tell you the truth I didn't know as well.
[22:28] A few days ago I heard her talking to Kabir about this...
[22:31] She said that she had ten percent in Kabir's food chain.
[22:36] That's how I learned about this.
[22:40] I can't believe that Niwal hid something like this from me.
[22:45] What can I say? This has hurt me as much as it has hurt you.
[22:52] But sister Niwal doesn't care about anyone but herself.
[22:57] If I say something she fights me over things.
[23:01] I won't say anything to her. She doesn't care about anyone else.
[23:08] Don't worry, I'm with you.
[23:15] Thank you Hamza...
[23:18] Why are you standing? She might come early from work today.
[23:23] No... I'll get going... I'll come by later.
[23:32] Farewell.
[24:34] Sister... are you finished packing?
[24:37] Yes almost... I'm just missing some of Hafsa's stuff.
[24:41] Really... that's good.
[24:42] Sister I was thinking that I would wrap up in a few months and be there with you guys.
[24:49] We can start our food business there.
[24:53] You can check the environment there and it will be easier for me.
[24:57] You can visit places where we can open restaurants.
[25:02] Hmm... that's a good idea.
[25:08] Right? You going there is good for brother Tawqir...
[25:13] But it will be good for us as well.
[25:16] New place, new people... new experience, and a new restaurant.
[25:20] I was a little bit sad to leave... but hearing that idea...
[25:26] I'm not anymore.
Me too.
[25:37] This is your office.
[25:42] My office?
How do you like it?
[25:46] It's amazing... thank you so much.
[25:50] I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here.
[25:53] You're welcome, but there is no need to be so formal.
[25:57] Sit down... I have a meeting. I'll go finish it, then we'll have coffee.
[26:03] Okay... bye
[26:40] When you're not here, I get very upset.
[26:43] I feel alone.
I missed you mother...
[26:48] Greetings*
I wanted to talk to you, wait.
[26:58] Yes, what is it?
[27:01] I was thinking of getting you and Niwal married.
[27:08] Look, whatever misunderstandings you two have...
[27:12] they are not that big.
[27:16] Once you marry her everything will be alright.
[27:21] Have you any idea what she did to me?
[27:24] She hid something huge from me!
[27:27] What did she hide from you?
[27:32] She has invested in Kabir's business, she's his business partner.
[27:42] You have no idea how angry I am right now.
[27:45] It's not that big deal, I'll talk to her. It will be as you want. Just relax now.
[27:58] He's so moody... thank God you're here, otherwise, he doesn't listen.
[28:08] You're back early today? Or did you not go?
[28:11] No, I didn't go. Sister Aliyah is going to Germany.
[28:21] I visited her. She was worried for Inham and asked me to come by often.
[28:27] I'm tired, I'm going to rest.
[28:51] Hamza, did you talk to sister Niwal?
[28:56] No.
[28:58] If you don't talk to her then who will?
[29:01] When mother was alive she used to stop her...
[29:04] but now... you have to make her understand. You're about to marry her
[29:09] and who will do it if not you?
[29:11] She doesn't care about her respect. Now sister Aliyah has left as well.
[29:17] She used to spend the entire day with Kabir, but there was sister Aliyah's presence.
[29:21] Now that's not the case, they have an open pass now.
[29:25] They can spend night and day together.
[29:35] Falak, do you think these quotations are correct?
[29:45] Sorry, Hamza if you were hurt by what I said. I just want the best for you.
[29:50] But maybe like always I'm wrong.
[29:56] Thank you... I'll look at these in my office and let you know.
[30:14] I have to do something. This won't do.
[30:22] Hamza doesn't react to anything that I say. 
[30:24] Even though he should end his relationship.
[30:29] What should I do that the game turns in my favor?
[30:40] Miss... sister Falak is crying in her room.
[30:44] What? Why is she crying?
I don't know, she's just crying.
[30:49] Alright go... I'll check up on her.
[31:14] Falak... what's the matter? Why are you crying?
[31:21] Falak... why are you crying? What happened?
[31:25] I miss Ilham... I want to meet her. I feel anxious... I want to see her.
[31:35] Falak, I'll take you in the morning.
[31:37] No sister, I can't spend the night like this.
[31:43] Sister, I know that Kabir won't let me meet her.
[31:49] Why not? Of course, he will. You're Ilham's mother, it's your right.
[31:54] Kabir won't mind, especially if I talk to him. He'll like that you want to meet Ilham.
[32:00] That's what you think. I know how Kabir is.
[32:04] He's very stubborn. 
[32:07] Sister, please do something. I want to meet my daughter...
[32:12] I can't sit in peace, do something sister.
[32:16] Wait till morning, I'll ask the driver to get to Ilham in the morning.
[32:19] No, I want to go right now... please come with me now.
[32:24] Do something... I want to meet her... once I see her I'll be fine. Please let's go.
[32:30] Alright fine... get up... I'll call Kabir...
[32:34] Let's go...
He'll let me meet her, right?
[32:38] Yes, he will... no one will stop you.
[33:14] Come here...
[33:19] My dear child.
[33:20] How are you? Your mother missed you.
[33:28] She's crying... I'll take her outside. What happened...
[33:44] After that visit, let me know.
[33:46] We'll discuss this project in your office tomorrow.
[33:50] Okay?
I'll ask my manager to contact you.
[33:56] Excuse me.
[34:02] Hello...
Hello Hamza...
[34:04] Sister Niwal is still not home. I think she's still in Kabir's home.
[34:08] You've helped me in my job and I have to help you as well.
[34:13] If you don't believe me, you can go to Kabir's home.
[34:20] I have to go... it's an emergency. I'll call you back.
[34:39] Niwal, please don't mind. 
[34:41] I didn't like Falak coming here and meeting Ilham
[34:46] After the way she left, she had no right to meet Ilham. 
[34:51] Legally she can't meet her as well.
[34:54] You're right... Falak is her mother...
[35:01] you, me, or anyone else can't stop her from meeting her daughter.
[35:05] Legally you have the custody but...
[35:09] you can't stop her from meeting her mother.
What are you saying?
[35:15] You know how Falak left Ilham.
[35:19] Still, you are defending her. You should have told her no at home.
[35:26] Alright fine... Falak might be cruel but you're not.
[35:32] What can I say...
[35:35] Only because of you, I'll let Falak meet Ilham.
Thank you.
[35:59] Hamza you?
[36:02] Yes me...
[36:04] What did you two think? Did you think I would not know what was going on between you two?
[36:10] Mind your tone, Hamza?
I should mind my tone? 
[36:13] You're a dishonorable man!
[36:17] Have you no shame in having an affair with your ex-wife's sister?
[36:21] What is this nonsense? Have you gone insane?
[36:24] How long has this been going on between you?
Enough!
[36:29] If you say one more word, I'll kill you.
[36:31] You have it wrong... I brought Falak here...
[36:38] She wanted to meet Ilham...
[36:42] Really.... you came here with Falak?
[36:46] Yes.
[36:48] Where is she?
[36:50] Out on the lawn with Ilham.
Alright...
[36:54] See if she's there...
[37:16] Where did she go?
[37:27] Where's Falak?
Falak is not out on the lawn.
[37:34] What do you mean?
[37:36] She would be here if you had brought her here.
[37:42] Believe me... Falak was crying and I brought her here to meet Ilham.
[37:47] Just shut up!
[37:56] I won't listen to your nonsense!
[37:59] Do you think I'll believe all of your lies?
[38:05] You know what, I always thought...
[38:09] why do you favor this man...
[38:14] Seeing it with my eyes, I've learned everything. You made a fool out of me.
[38:24] I'm disappointed that I fell in love with a girl like you.
[38:35] The truth is that you were never worthy of my love.
[38:39] You always said that you didn't want to marry me.
[38:44] You won't reject me... today I reject you.
[38:54] I refuse to marry you.
