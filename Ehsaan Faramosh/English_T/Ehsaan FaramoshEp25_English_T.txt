[01:21] Uncle, do you know I have an annual function at school. I'll be a fairy.
[01:28] Show me too as well.
[01:29] Ok And you know mom was saying she'll change my school. Isn't it mom?
[01:36] Hmm..
[01:38] Why? Why are you changing her school?
[01:41] Her school is very good. Her studies will be affected.
[01:46] Its far away and it takes a lot of time to go there.
[01:50] They're opening a new branch of her school nearby so,
[01:54] I thought I'll get her enrolled in that one. It'll be easy to come and go.
[01:58] New branch?
[02:01] But who knows what sort of a staff will be there and no idea about the studies as well.
[02:05] We don't know whether she'll be able to adjust. She has all her friends here.
[02:09] You know she might get disturbed if she goes there. What if her education is disturbed?
[02:13] I'll do one thing. I'll pick and drop her from school.
[02:17] Alright. I used to do it earlier as well, I'll do it now too.
[02:22] I think your work and your business is being affected.
[02:27] Why should I bother you then?
[02:30] I'm her mother. I want to take this responsibility myself.
[02:35] What if someone says something later,
[02:39] What is wrong, sister in law? Why are you being so formal? Why would anyone say anything?
[02:44] Hafsa is the life of this house. Why would anyone say anything.
[02:51] Hafsa's schooling comes first and everything else comes later.
[02:57] Thank you Kabeer. You've always supported me in everything but now it is,
[03:06] I have reserved a seat for Hafsa in the new branch. It won't be good to say no now.
[03:15] Another thing that I wanted to discuss with you.
[03:19] This seems the right time to discuss.
[03:25] Kabeer I want to you to handle your entire business yourself.
[03:33] I want to resign very soon.
[03:41] What are you saying?
[03:43] Yes. I think very soon, in the coming months, I'll not go to the office.
[03:50] What is wrong with you? Why are you saying this all of a sudden?
[03:54] If you don't come to the office, how will everything run?
[03:59] Why is it not possible?
[04:01] If not today then tomorrow, you have to handle everything.
[04:06] Everything is yours. Nothing belongs to me.
[04:25] Sister in law, did someone say something to you?
[04:31] No. Nobody said anything. I, now, just want to spend time with Hafsa now.
[04:45] That's why I want her school to be nearby so that I can pick and drop her.
[04:54] To be honest, Hafsa supported me a lot when I was sick.
[05:02] This is true. Whenever she is in front of my eyes, I feel fresh, positive. I feel hopeful.
[05:16] That's why I want to give her time.
[05:19] I think she has been neglected because of this business.
[05:31] You're right.
[05:33] I understand that you want to spend time with your family.
[05:37] You should definitely do that. I'm not saying you shouldn't.
[05:43] But, right now I'm not in a position to handle all the business myself.
[05:52] This business is as much yours as its mine and you'll have to take care of it.
[05:58] Its your responsibility.
[06:02] Lets do one thing, lets find a solution to this.
[06:05] Even if its only for a little while, please do come to the office.
[06:11] See, I cannot handle everything alone.
[06:15] Please don't burden my weak shoulders with so much. I won't be able to handle it.
[06:24] Please.
[06:27] Mom, should we go out? We need to buy the fairy dress.
[06:31] Of course. Its very important to get the fairy dress. We have a farewell party in our school.
[06:40] Hmm. I'm right. Think about it.
[06:48] Did you sit with uncle to color? We'll get it done fast and then leave.
[07:08] Kabeer? What did Aaliya tell you?
[07:13] I heard something about family and business.
[07:18] She wants me to handle the business alone.
[07:23] But why?
[07:27] She wants to give time to her family. She thinks her family is being neglected because of the business.
[07:34] By the way she's absolutely right Kabeer but such a big decision and that too all of a sudden.
[07:41] Even I don't understand how can she take such a big decision alone when she knows I cannot handle the business alone.
[07:50] By the way Kabeer should I say something?
[07:52] Today or tomorrow, you'll be the one handling everything. How long will she help you for?
[07:59] And as it is, she has a lot of responsibilities. Hafsa is growing up,
[08:03] she needs her and Toqueer too. And this house. I cannot handle the house alone.
[08:11] You see yourself, if you cannot handle the house yourself then how will I handle such a big business myself.
[08:19] Kabeer you should also understand her predicament.
[08:22] She isn't only a businesswoman but also a mother and a wife.
[08:26] She is also the woman of the house. She has to look into everything.
[08:32] That's right but whatever it is, I have asked her to come to the office for sure.
[08:37] The way she was looking after her responsibilities, she can still do the same.
[08:43] I cannot handle everything alone.
[08:48] Why can't you? Of course you can. You're educated.
[08:53] I believe you can handle everything better than her.
[08:56] Falak, even if I learn for a hundred years, I cannot work like Aaliya.
[09:02] Her business approach and thought process is mind blowing.
[09:07] You know we have a lot of competitors with investments and will power
[09:13] but what they don't have is Aaliya's brains.
[09:17] So, its impossible to handle everything without Aaliya.
[09:23] Alright, so bye. I'm off to work.
[09:50] Kabeer I want you to handle the business yourself. I want to resign soon.
[09:59] I think in the coming months, I'll not even go to the office.
[10:06] If not today, then you'll have to handle everything tomorrow.
[10:10] Its all yours, not mine. I feel my family is neglected because of this business.
[10:48] Please get me Mr. Owais who looks into the legal matters of the company.
[10:51] Its very urgent.
[10:56] How are you Mr. Owais? Actually I wanted to get a few papers made for the company shares.
[11:02] Can you come into my office? Yes. Right now. I'm waiting.
[11:11] Nawal? Nawal? Come along dear.
Hello mom.
[11:17] Hello. So sudden?
[11:21] Yes. I was feeling anxious at home so I thought I'd come see you. I would be fresh.
[11:26] You did good.
Where is Nawal?
[11:29] She's getting ready upstairs?
[11:32] Are you people going somewhere?
[11:34] Yes. We're going to Nawal's in law's house.
Is everything alright?
[11:38] Actually Sofia isn't well so I thought we'd ask about her.
What happened to her?
[11:43] Just food poisoning.
Alright then I'll come along.
[11:50] You should rest at home, you must be tired. We'll just go and come back.
[11:55] I stay at home all the time mom.
[11:57] As it is, what will I do all alone here?
[12:00] Alright then. Now go and check on Nawal if she's ready. Bring her down.
[12:11] How are you now auntie?
[12:13] I'm a lot better dear. Thank you so much for coming. You guys are just being formal.
[12:18] Its alright.
[12:19] As soon as I found out, I couldn't hold back. I came along mom and Nawal to ask after you.
[12:26] Thank you dear.
[12:29] By the way auntie, I'm upset with you.
[12:33] Why dear? Why are you upset?
[12:35] You were sick and you didn't even call me once. I would have come.
[12:40] Hamza, you told Nawal and got everyone worried. It was just food poisoning, not a big deal.
[12:46] You should have told me.
[12:50] You have no idea she was so upset that I didn't tell her earlier.
[12:56] Aunty you're saying as if I'm a stranger.
Dear, you're my daughter.
[13:01] But mom, isn't it good. You've freshen up ever since Nawal came.
[13:05] Yes that's correct. All my sickness has run away.
[13:09] Did you eat anything?
Yes the maid is making soup for me.
[13:13] I'll go and get it.
Why will you go? You sit with me. She'll get it.
[13:17] No. I do everything for mom at home so I'd like to do it for you as well.
[13:22] Wow, so nice but I'd prefer you stay with me.
[13:25] I feel better in your company. You've brought up your daughter so well.
[13:30] Its the first time in life, I'm happy about a decision my son made.
[13:35] I was feeling so unwell but now since I've seen you I feel perfectly fine. See my soup is here.
[13:40] Thank you.
[13:42] Come on get something going for refreshments.
[13:46] No auntie we'll leave in a while.
[13:50] Actually I have to attend an important meeting for an NGO.
[13:54] Alright then if you want to leave, you can. I'll drop Nawal. I'll feel better with her.
[13:59] Hamza will drop her if you don't object.
As you like, I have no objections.
[14:12] Alright. I'll leave with mom.
[14:16] Yes Falak dear, if you want to leave, you can. But its good if you stay, we'll talk. Hamza can drop the two of you later.
[14:28] If you insist, I'll stay back.
[15:32] What are you doing in your room?
[15:34] I was just looking at the house. I saw the door open so I came in. I didn't know this was your room.
[15:39] If you mind, I'm really sorry.
No its not that. Its okay.
[15:45] Do you like to read books as well?
[15:48] Yes at times.
[15:53] Alright, I'll leave now.
[16:03] Yes dear?
Where is Nawal?
[16:06] She was right here, I think she went out for a while.
[16:10] She might be with Hamza.
[16:12] I told her to sit with you, look after you and take care but she left as soon as she got an opportunity.
[16:20] In fact she said it would be good that she'll get an opportunity to talk to Hamza.
[16:25] She has been for quite a long time. She talked to me and I felt I was alright. She'll be around somewhere.
[16:33] Alright, I'll go and check where they are. You take care.
[17:18] Thank you Nawal for coming here. Mom loved that you came over. She was so happy.
[17:26] You don't have to thank me. You should have told me last night. I would have come with mom.
[17:33] Auntie must be missing your sister.
Yes she's been calling insistently.
[17:42] The maid was here and so was I so she didn't have a problem.
[17:52] Nawal I was thinking we should shift to Canada after we get married. My sister is there too.
[18:05] Hamza, I cannot shift to Canada with you. Mom's here. She'll be alone here.
[18:15] I didn't think about it.
[18:18] We'll take her along, whats the problem?
[18:20] No. Hamza your business is here. Everything is going well, why do you need to settle abroad?
[18:33] If you're thinking about leaving me again, tell me now. We haven't moved so far along.
[18:42] There is a way back. If you want to leave me once again, tell me now. You left me for five years earlier as well.
[18:50] Quiet. How can you think about me leaving you? I'm thinking of shifting with you.
[18:59] I'm not going alone. I came back for you.
[19:03] Had I wanted to go back, I wouldn't have come back.
[19:15] Auntie is getting worried that you two are not around. Come along please.
[19:30] Mom is waiting. I'm going, you come along.
[19:45] Nawal, take care now. You don't have to go there anymore.
[19:51] What will Sofia aunty thinking? You come running on one call as if you have nothing to do.
[19:57] Oh no. I only went to meet her today. Had she not been sick, I wouldn't have gone.
But still..
[20:02] You two are back?
[20:04] Yes right now. Mom believe it or not, they're such fake people. Sofia auntie was being overly sweet.
[20:12] I felt she is like Aaliya. Mom, I'd say, be careful and make her understand as well.
[20:18] She doesn't have to go out with Hamza or visit their house.
[20:22] They're just engaged for now. Only a little time is left in the wedding. They should wait.
[20:26] If any relative sees, they'll talk a lot. How many mouths will you shut?
[20:32] If I have to make my relatives happy, I should just die.
[20:36] No they'll not be happy even then. They'll say you had to die a certain way.
[20:41] They want to talk and we cannot stop living because of them.
[20:46] But we need to worry about our reputation as well.
[20:50] I'm worried about you that's why I'm trying to make you understand.
[20:56] Oh well. Mom, I'll leave now.
[20:58] Why? You just came. Sit with us for a while. Have tea. You're always riding high.
[21:05] Please sit with us.
No I'm already late. I'll leave now. I'll come back.
[21:14] Take care of yourself.
Alright. Bye.
[21:16] Bye. Be safe. Call me when you get there.
Sure.
[21:22] Falak is thinking unnecessarily. Sofia auntie is very kind hearted.
[21:28] The upturns in the society have made her mature enough. She might sound bitter but she was right.
[21:37] You should be a little careful.
[21:41] Alright.
[22:07] Hello.
Hello.
[22:09] Falak, keep this file safely.
[22:13] What file is this?
[22:16] These are papers of my business.
[22:19] I have named half of the business to Aaliya.
What?
[22:24] I mean why Kabeer? She said no herself that she doesn't want to go to the office.
[22:30] She wants to give time to the house then why are you forcing her?
So what?
[22:36] I've given her half her share.
[22:40] I should have done this long ago.
[22:45] It might be that she isn't coming to the office thinking that the entire business in my name,
[22:50] why should she work hard.
Kabeer, it isn't so.
[22:54] She would never think that. She's very nice.
[22:58] I think she's right that she wants to stay home and give time at home.
[23:03] And as it is, the entire business belongs to you. She'll never take this file.
[23:10] I will never wrong anyone. Everyone will get whatever their right is.
[23:14] I've given Aaliya what is rightfully hers. Whether she keeps it or sells it, its up to her.
[23:22] Now this is an important file, take care of it. Some papers are missing.
[23:26] Once they're completed I'll hand them over to Aaliya. Okay? I'll go freshen up.
[23:55] Nawal is such a nice girl.
[23:57] The qualities she has, girls today lack everything.
[24:01] Didn't I tell you?
[24:05] She's very caring, loving. She strictly instructed me to take my medicine on time
[24:10] and not eat anything odd for my upset stomach.
[24:13] And she has told the maid to not cook spicy food.
[24:17] She's so sweet. I'm so happy dear. Well done.
[24:23] So what do you think? Should I call her here forever? She'll take care of you and me.
[24:29] Let me get better and I'll talk myself.
[24:33] Once she's here, everything will be alive. It'll be lovely having her here.
[24:39] true
[24:52] I've named half of my business in Aaliya's name.
[24:55] I should have done it a long time ago.
[25:02] I will never wrong anyone, Falak. Everyone will get whatever their right is.
[25:06] I've given Aaliya what's rightfully hers. She can sell it or keep it, its up to her.
[25:19] I will have to do something fast. Kabeer will give her everything.
[25:40] Noor, what is all this mess?
Hafsa was doing this. I'll clear it off.
[25:47] Is this a playground that she was playing here?
[25:49] If she wants to play, why doesn't she play in her room? Wind up everything.
[25:58] Hafsa who throws toys like this.
Sorry, auntie.
[26:23] I just told Falak to have dinner ready early.
[26:26] Yes mom's right. Mommy isn't lying.
[26:35] Noor?
Yes?
[26:37] Hafsa will wind all this up. You go and iron the clothes I had kept out.
Sure.
[27:41] Hafsa dear, put that in as well.
[27:57] Falak, hurry up. We're getting late.
Yes. Just two minutes.
[28:14] What are you looking for Falak?
[28:15] Kabeer my bangles. They were here but not anymore.
[28:21] Check them, they'll be here. Where would they be?
The box is empty. I kept them here.
[28:28] Noor? Noor?
[28:33] Yes mam?
Noor, my bangles were here. Did you see them?
[28:38] No. I haven't seen them and they weren't here when I cleaned.
[28:43] What do you mean they weren't here?
[28:46] Where did you keep them? Do you remember?
[28:49] Yes Kabeer I kept them here myself.
[28:53] Hafsa was playing here in the evening. She had messed up the entire room.
[28:58] I didn't say no, she's just a child. Maybe she kept them somewhere. I'll ask her.
[29:09] When there are a lot of kids, so that's why its written few children.
[29:13] Hafsa dear?
[29:18] Dear, you were playing in my room. Where did you keep my bangles?
[29:22] What? I was playing with my toys.
[29:26] Now what new drama is this?
[29:30] What is this? This isn't a drama.
[29:34] Wait a minute.
[29:39] Falak, what is it? What happened?
[29:41] Falak cannot find her bangles and she was saying maybe,
[29:46] Hafsa was playing with her bangles so she might have kept them somewhere.
[29:51] Falak, don't drag children into an argument between adults. 
[29:54] Before blaming Hafsa, find your bangles in your room.
[29:58] I am not accusing her. You're the limit.
[30:01] Then why would Hafsa steal your bangles. What does she have to do with your jewelry?
[30:10] Hafsa, dear, you kept the toys in your basket. Where is the basket?
[30:15] Its in my room.
[30:18] Noor, go and get the toy basket.
[30:34] Bring it here. Take out the toys.
[31:09] Now everyone can see with your eyes. 
[31:12] I didn't accuse her and neither was this a drama.
[31:17] I'll just say that don't bring up your daughter like you.
[31:20] How dare you question my daughter's upbringing?
[31:25] If you raise a finger at Hafsa or say anything odd, you'll see the worse of me, remember this.
[31:33] Falak didn't mean this..
[31:35] Whatever she means, I've understood well but maybe the two of you don't understand.
[31:42] Why are you just escalating matters?
Come on..
[31:55] Kabeer what did I say?
[31:58] Nothing Falak. There's a misunderstanding. She might have kept it by mistake. Come.
[32:05] You also support them. I'm the only wrong person in this house.
[32:09] Hafsa tell me truthfully, did you keep those bangles in your toys?
[32:15] No mom I didn't. In fact I kept my toys in the basket. I remember it mom.
[32:22] Listen to her. She didn't keep the bangles in the basket.
[32:26] Aaliya everybody say the bangles came out of her toy box.
[32:30] Not fair dad, don't blame me.
[32:33] Then who kept the bangles in your basket, dear?
[32:37] I don't know. You should ask Falak auntie about this.
[32:42] Aaliya she's a child. She doesn't understand. 
[32:46] Maybe she made a mistake and you made a big mess because of her.
[32:52] If Falak had said something, you should hear it quietly. What difference does it make?
[32:59] You're making me understand.
[33:02] She is questioning my upbringing and you want me to hear it out quietly. How can you?
[33:09] Aaliya I'm saying this for the sake of some peace in the house.
[33:13] I'm sorry Touqeer, 
[33:14] I'll hear everything about myself but I'll not hear a word about my daughter and her upbringing.
[33:20] Now tell me what should I do?
[33:22] You tell me what should I do? No matter how much I try, something or the other happens.
[33:28] My child. She put such a little child in a mess. Why drag her in the middle? 
[33:34] Come, sit with mama.
[33:43] Falak why did you have to all this? 
[33:47] How can you even think this?
[33:49] Kabeer what did I say that she got so angry? I just said something.
[33:53] It wasn't a good move to question Aaliya's upbringing.
[33:58] Falak I didn't like it either.
[34:01] I didn't lie. If her daughter steals, her mother's upbringing will be questioned.
[34:06] For God's sake Falak, be quiet. Why don't you understand? This isn't something small. 
[34:13] Hafsa is a small child.
[34:16] And she has never taken anything from anyone ever. 
[34:20] And if she made a mistake and put your bangles in her basket, what difference does it make?
[34:29] I didn't escalate matters. Aaliya was the one getting angry.
[34:32] Don't you think you said more than what was needed?
[34:36] Should you have said that?
[34:37] What difference does it make? I was angry.
[34:42] That's why they say that a person should think before he speaks 
[34:47] because the words that leave the mouth is like an arrow that leaves the bow. They never return.
[35:04] Falak? Falak? Bring the file.
Which file?
[35:13] The business shares file. Have you forgotten?
[35:16] Yes I had. I'll just get it.
[35:38] Was it this one?
[35:42]  Kabeer think before you do anything. What if you regret later?
[35:47] What is there to think?
[35:49] Everybody should get what is rightfully theirs. 
[35:53] I'm just regretting why didn't I think of it earlier?
[35:58] I should have given Aaliya her share earlier. 
[36:03] Whatever she has done for me,
[36:08] this is all very less in front of it.
[36:12] I know you're right but I was saying considering the situation at home. 
[36:20] What if Aaliya and Toqueer think that you want to live separately after giving them their share.
[36:26] I don't expect them to think this way but if they do, I'll make them understand. 
[36:33] Don't you worry. Lets go.
[36:54] Sister in law?
[36:58] I know you must be hurt after what Falak said. Falak realizes it too. Please forgive her.
[37:11] Its alright. 
[37:14] I was a little angry as well. I realized later.
[37:20] Elders make mistake so children can make mistakes as well.
[37:26] You always show a big heart.
[37:30] Thank you so much. See Falak?
[37:35] You aren't coming to the office today?
[37:37] I will come. I have a few visits, I'll come after them.
[37:42] Okay. See you then.
Have a good day.
[37:45] Bye.
Bye.
[37:54] You hid the bangles deliberately in Hafsa's toy box so that,
[38:00] everybody could believe she was a thief
[38:03] Yes, of course.
[38:07] Why are you doing this? What did my daughter do to you? 
[38:12] You're up against me. Say whatever you want to say to me. Why drag a child in between?
[38:19] She is just a weak pawn and I can break your pride through her.
[38:28] You are very proud about being perfect in everything. Miss. Perfection?
[38:36] So I just want to break your pride. A woman's pride might not break otherwise,
[38:43] but when it comes to testing her children, she loses it then.
[38:51] I made a big mistake bringing you back. I shouldn't have.
[39:07] Nawal I want you to join the office again.
[39:12] Hamza this isn't possible.
[39:14] Why isn't it possible?
[39:17] Because I've joined a new office two days ago.
