[01:14] As far as we know Nawal is the only child of Miss Sultana, Falak is the daughter of their servant
[01:23] There is no use of messing up with me.
[01:26] If you try to put obstacles in my way, you are going to get trapped in them not me
[01:34] Try to prove that I am not Miss Sultana's daughter! Who is going to believe you?
[01:41] Tauqeer brother? Kabeer? Nobody is going to believe you
[01:45] I will deal with you very harshly if you try to defame me in the future
[01:55] What should I do? Should I tell them or not?
[02:09] Please forgive me, don't kick me out of this house like this!
[02:13] You have lost the right to live in this house! You lied to us
[02:18] Go away from here and don't you dare step inside this house ever again! Did you understand?
[02:22] Kick her out of this house right now!
[02:25] Kabir please don't kick me out of this house!
[02:28] What happened?
[02:30] Kabir please don't kick me out of the house, I haven't committed any sin! Please don't distance yourself from me
[02:35] Hey you had a bad dream! Come back to your senses!
[02:40] Kabir promise me that you won't believe anybody and kick me out of this house!
[02:47] Falak why would I distance myself from you? You are my wife, I love you!
[02:52] Still you promise me that you wont ever leave me alone or kick me out of this house!
[02:57] Okay dear I promise you that we would stay together forever! Okay?
[03:03] I am so scared
[03:08] Go to sleep and relax yourself, it was just a dream!
[04:12] I have to say something important
[04:16] Okay tell me
[04:18] Please listen to me carefully first and then give your reaction. And don't consider me Falak
[04:28] Listen Alia if it is related to Falak then don't do it! I am genuinely not interested.
[04:35] Did you see Kabir's reaction last night? How upset he was!
[04:42] He is my younger brother and I can't see tears in his eyes
[04:47] Is that understood?
[04:48] I know that you and Kabir are really upset but this is something really important.
[04:55] You have trusted me throughout your life, show some trust no as well
[05:02] Don't misunderstand me! I am not an enemy, it just looks like that all the mess is because of me!
[05:10] Okay tell me what is it!
[05:14] Falak is not the real daughter of miss Sultana!
[05:19] What?
[05:21] Do you know what you are saying? Are you in your senses?
[05:25] I am telling the truth
[05:26] Alia do you have any idea what chaos it can make if anybody gets to know about it!
[05:33] Yes I do have any idea! I am not crazy to say anything like this!
[05:37] I know how it can affect us! I went to a party yesterday, there I met Miss Sultana's sister in law. She told that
[05:51] I seriously can't believe this!
[05:55] I had no idea you would go to this extreme to show enmity with Falak!
[06:00] Do you still think that I am lying?
[06:03] Sowhat do you expect Alia? You think I should believe everything that you say?
[06:09] I am not that crazy!
[06:11] You have to trust me! I am telling the truth.
[06:15] How can I say something like this without any reason?
[06:19] For God's sake!Just keep quiet now and don't you dare say anything like this ever again!
[06:25] Tauqeer listen to me!
[06:27] No you listen to me! What do you want?
[06:31] That I and my brother should get separated and die to see each others' faces in the future!
[06:37] Tauqeer I have never wanted this!
[06:39] Then don't talk about this thing ever again!
[07:03] I wont keep quiet like this, I will tell show Falak's real face to everyone!
[07:55] I think you pack these three Mr. Abid please
[07:59] Aunty three are too much, I want this one only!
[08:03] Daughter you are the first girl to say no to the jewelry, other wise girls want to have so many jewelry items!
[08:09] No aunt there is no need to buy such an expensive jewelry!
[08:14] If I wont spend on you then on whom would I spend? You are my to be daughter in law!
[08:22] Mr. Abid please pack all this and show me something in the day wear as well like a bangle or something
[08:28] Aunt this is a lot please, there is no need of anything more!
[08:31] My daughter I am buying them with my happiness, wear them! I will be very happy whenever you will wear them dear!
[08:58] Yes Alia?
[09:01] Do you know that lie comes forward someday because it is baseless!
[09:07] What do you mean? Can you explain please?
[09:13] I want the real truth for what I am going to ask you
[09:22] Falak isn't your real daughter, she is your servant's daughter. Is that true?
[09:32] What are you saying? How dare you say anything like this?
[09:43] Falak is my daughter!
[09:46] Just think about it once! Because DNA test can prove the truth!
[09:59] But one thing is for sure! I will expose this truth in front of everyone that she is not your daughter!
[10:13] Are you warning me? What will you gain out of this?
[10:19] For the past few months, whatever she has been doing is reflecting her family!
[10:34] And if you feel that I am doing a baseless talk with you, then know it clearly
[10:39] that Miss Fareeha was present in the gathering where I got to know about it!
[10:49] You know her right? She is your sister in law. And I would even go to her if needed!
[10:57] Fareeha sister can never say anything like this! You are lying!
[11:02] You are lying! And to hide the truth you are lying again and again!
[11:14] What is your problem with Falak?
[11:17] What has she done to you? Why do you want to ruin her life?
[11:21] She has shaken the foundation of my house!
[11:24] She has bluffed everyone so cleverly that I am shocked! She is ruining my life instead!
[11:31] There should be respect from both sides,
[11:36] you only know how to take respect and not give. It is as simple as that!
[11:44] It is okay if you people don't want to tell the truth. I will find the truth myself and you wait for that day now! Excuse me
[12:02] Didn't I ask you to tell the truth? Do you see the result now?
[12:08] I didn't want to tell a lie, I wanted to tell the truth but it was Falak's demand and stubbornness
[12:16] Have you seen the result of her stubbornness?
[12:19] We have to tell a thousand lies just to hide that one truth!
[12:27] Make a call to Fareeha sister, I want to talk to her. A new problem has started!
[12:56] Why did you go to my house? What did you need?
[13:00] You can shake the foundation of my house and I can't even go to your house!
[13:04] Yes you can't! I know your intentions very well!
[13:09] I am not interested as well! But I had to go to know the truth!
[13:16] Why did you betray us? Why did you lie?
[13:19] So now are you at peace? Didn't I tell you that its my family and they will support me!
[13:27] They won't stand by your side!
[13:30] So you called them to say that?
[13:34] It has been your style to portray lie as a truth by making a fuss out of it!
[13:39] But this is not going to work anymore. Not everything can go by your will!
[13:45] And whatever you are blaming me for is completely baseless, it has no connection to the truth!
[13:53] You are lying!
[14:00] Oh!
[14:07] Oh! Sister in law
[14:11] Alia!
[14:15] Alia sister why did you push me?
[14:18] I didn't push you, you fell on your own! Tauqeer did you see she fell on her own?
[14:21] Have you gone crazy? What is this going on?
[14:25] How are you talking to me?
[14:27] I am talking to you in the same tone which I should have adopted a long time back!
[14:38] Falak are you alright?
[14:40] No I am fine
[14:42] Look Falak I am really very sorry! I say sorry on her behalf
[14:49] No its okay!
[15:09] Ouch! It didn't hurt that much that he had to scold you. Bye
[15:49] Sister in law why did you tell Alia about Falak when I told you not to mention anything about it?
[15:59] I know that you detest Falak but I had no idea that in your hatred for her, you would try to ruin her marriage
[16:10] Don't blame me! It was Rozina who started this topic and I was just covering it up.
[16:16] Rozina is your friend but little did she know that you haven't told anything to Kabir's family!
[16:28] It is such a big problem now! It can ruin her marriage. She came last night and she was really upset and was crying!
[16:43] She has to face such a big problem now
[16:47] It had to happen some day!
[16:52] No matter how much you try to hide the truth, it is revealed one day.
[16:58] Didn't I warn you to tell the truth? After all how long can you hide it?
[17:05] One day this truth will reveal itself, there are many people in our circle who know the reality!
[17:15] How would you face everyone then? Nobody is going to remember the goodness
[17:21] they will only remember this! But you people didn't listen to me!
[17:24] Sister I am already quite stressed! Alia has already tortured Falak so much,
[17:30] God knows how many people will know about this through Alia! There will be more problems for Falak!
[17:35] Nothing will happen! God has put Falak in this difficulty, He is going to ease it for her!
[17:41] Don't take much stress because of Falak. leave her on her own!
[17:43] Focus on Nawal, she is your real daughter not Falak!
[17:58] Sister, Falak is also my daughter. Her worries are mine
[18:04] Do you know now I am regretting that why I didn't tell Alia about the whole truth! Why did I cover it up?
[18:40] Alia what's wrong with you? Was it appropriate what you did?
[18:47] I didn't push her! She fell on her own! Stop blaming me!
[18:52] Oh for God's sake!
[18:56] Alia how much more would you lie?
[18:59] I saw you myself and you are saying that she was lying? Wow!
[19:08] Why don't you understand? She is just bluffing you and you think she is telling the truth
[19:16] Kabir explained you so nicely last night
[19:22] but it didn't matter to you at all!
[19:29] In fact I feel that nothing matters to you now!
[19:36] And that is just sad! That is just sad!
[20:11] Greetings!
[20:13] Greetings
[20:25] What happened? Why are you feeling low?
[20:31] Leave it Kabir! Nothing new, it is the same problems
[20:38] Still I want to know what it is!
[20:44] Noting Kabir, leave it. You will feel bad if I tell you!
[20:51] Falak tell me what is it!
[20:56] Sit down and tell me
[21:01] Now tell me!
[21:05] Aliya sister pushed me today!
[21:09] In the start there were arguments only but now she is turning violent
[21:16] Kabir I am bearing all this for you only!
[21:21] And I will bear it till I get tired
[21:27] I am sorry Falak
[21:31] I don't know what to do!
[21:36] I can leave neither you nor Tauqeer brother and Alia sister! I am in a very difficult situation
[21:47] It is your decision to leave or not and you will find me standing by your side in it
[21:56] That is why I consider myself quite lucky. Always by my side like this
[22:10] Keep smiling!
[22:13] I am bringing tea for you, you freshen up
[22:16] Your smile has freshened me up!
[22:40] You both know that Alia isn't well that's why I have made a decision
[22:52] Falak now this house is your responsibility!
[23:09] You will manage this house now. You will take all the decisions regarding the meals and over all management.
[23:17] Alia needs rest
[23:25] Falak I think brother is absolutely right!
[23:27] There is so much load on sister in law, and her health is important to us more than anything else!
[23:44] I totally agree Tauqeer brother but I can't take this privilege away from sister in law.
[23:49] Since many years she has been managing this house, she has done a great job.
[23:56] I don't have any experience at all in managing the house
[24:00] Falak Alia will help you if you need any assistance. This is my final decision
[24:11] Okay if you insist. I will try my best not to give you any chance to complain
[25:19] I know that you are upset with me
[25:23] but trust me I did it all for your betterment!
[25:29] The amount of responsibilities upon you are making you tired.
[25:34] You think so weirdly.
[25:37] I just want you to take rest so that you feel better Alia
[25:44] Do you know I think that I am a burden on you!
[25:52] The way you have relieved me off the responsibilities of this house,
[25:58] relieve me off this relationship also!
[26:02] For the love of God! Why do you think so negatively Alia?
[26:08] Today you can't see the truth but it will be too late when you will!
[26:17] Look Alia Falak is also a part of this house
[26:22] and we should share responsibilities so that she feels that it is her house as well
[26:32] No matter the amount of justifications you want to give but you also know that you have done wrong with me.
[26:42] I have spent a whole lifetime to make this house beautiful and you snatched that responsibility from me
[26:55] There is absolutely no value of anything I say whatsoever! It is very clear to me today
[27:21] I have made a list of all items, still if you don't find anything call me
[27:26] Okay ma'am
[27:31] I have to handle the responsibility of this house because of you now!
[27:38] You never wanted this, you must be so sad!
[27:42] I can see how helpless you are feeling.
[27:47] You had put a great effort in making this house
[27:52] and now someone else has become the ruler!
[27:57] This is your doubt!
[28:00] This house was mine, is mine and will always remain mine!
[28:05] Really? Well right now I am ruling this house and you also have to listen to me.
[28:13] I have taken this house away from you and very soon I am going to take away Kabir also!
[29:30] Hurry up put this in Nawal's room!
[29:32] Oh it's good that you came!
[29:35] Alia didn't come?
[29:36] No she wasn't well. All the responsibilities have been given to me! She doesn't do anything at all
[29:43] Did she say anything?
[29:45] No everything is okay for now. She can start a new drama when she will lose her mind
[29:48] Okay go help Nawal, she is getting so confused in getting ready!
[29:53] Mother have you over spent?
[29:56] You were so conscious when it was my turn
[29:59] I spent more than my capacity when it was your turn! You are thankless.
[30:03] Go and help Nawal, let me get ready
[30:09] Greetings sister!
[30:11] You had to be here an hour ago!
[30:20] Haven't you spent a bit too much?
[30:23] Hamza has bought all these things for me!
[30:34] Who gave this to you?
[30:36] Hamza gifted this also. Isn't it pretty?
[30:42] No it is not! He should gift you something worthy!
[30:47] It is so pretty! Don't say that! I and Hamza both love it
[31:01] You should have told Sophia aunt that it is an engagement not a wedding that she sent so many things!
[31:06] I told her not to over do it but she said she wanted to, as she has only one son.
[31:13] Mother also told me not to stop her because she might feel bad then
[31:20] It is great that you can enjoy such clothes also other wise you could only imagine them in your dreams or watch them hanging on the boutique's racks!
[31:32] Yeah I had no interest as well
[31:37] I should also get ready now!
[31:39] Yeah hurry up!
[32:00] Kabir is the only sibling I have and I love him more than my life Alia!
[32:12] And I don't want to lose him at any cost
[32:18] Kabir is as dear to me as he is to you!
[32:27] Why are you doing this all then? Why?
[32:33] I can't make you understand!
[32:35] If I would say something, you would think that I am saying bad things about Falak.
[32:41] It is better that I should keep quiet!
[32:45] I don't know where is the fault.
[32:49] You are trying to compete with Falak.
[32:53] But there is no competition between you and Falak
[33:02] Alia make a promise with me.
[33:05] You would not fight with Falak over anything
[33:09] and you will give her the respect she deserves.
[33:16] Look Alia I want us all to live together forever
[33:25] And if Kabir gets separated from me, I will break apart
[33:35] Please promise me that you would regard me
[36:19] The ring is so beautiful!
[36:21] Nawal is so lucky, her husband is quite rich, he has a very big business.
[36:28] Her mother in law has a very big heart also
[36:33] They have so much money, they can buy hundreds of rings like this!
[36:50] Falak!
[36:54] What are you thinking?
[37:03] Nothing much, I was just envying your fate! Fate can favor such people also
[37:13] Falak look at the ring! It is so pretty!
[37:19] I think aunt must have chosen it, she has an amazing taste. She selected all my jewelry!
[37:45] Aunt!
[37:46] Yes
[37:48] You sent so many precious gifts and it is such a grand function of engagement!
[37:54] Did you see? Nawal showed you the gifts right? Did you like them?
[37:57] Yes they were beautiful and I really admired them! They looked so expensive
[38:02] I bought jewelry from here and bought the diamond set from Canada with a lot of love!
[38:10] The dress is so beautiful! Trust me you have a great taste!
[38:15] Nawal sister's choice is considered too bad in our family
[38:20] No I disagree! Nawal has a very sophisticated choice, she likes delicate things.
[38:26] Many people just run after the brand name but she doesn't. She is such a classy girl!
[38:34] Won't you eat anything?
[38:35] No not now, after some time. I am talking to my friend right now
[39:58] The ring is so beautiful!
[40:00] Nawal is quite lucky! They are quite rich, they can afford anything!
