[01:08] You know very well I just got done with Falak's wedding.
[01:13] I cannot marry off Nawal so soon. It'll be difficult. I need time.
[01:21] Alright then. Since we have accepted one thing you said, you should also accept one of ours.
[01:27] Yes.
[01:27] I want them to sign the marriage contract instead of an engagement. We will be spending the same amount on both.
[01:35] But.. a wedding or signing of the marriage contract, its the same thing.
[01:40] We can get them to sign the documents now and they can start living together after six months.
[01:46] This is what Asjad thinks. He doesn't want to burden you.
[01:50] If we have an engagement first, the expenses will add up.
[01:53] And then the wedding. Why not get the marriage contract signed first
[01:56] and then we'll have a simple wedding after some time.
[02:00] Everything you're saying is correct.
[02:03] But I'm not in favor of an engagement or a wedding both.
[02:10] I want to fix a date for the wedding for around six months later.
[02:16] We'll have the wedding then and this way we'll get time to make preparations.
[02:21] But Sultana, we need to have something official.
[02:25] What are you afraid of? We're respectable people and our word makes it official.
[02:31] I have given you my word. Engagements or weddings are all worldly affairs.
[02:39] We don't have anything such in our religion.
[02:42] Then why should we get involved in all these things?
[02:45] But we need to answer the society as well.
[02:50] Two families are being linked, we ought to make an official announcement. What will we tell people otherwise?
[02:56] Please accept what we're saying. We should have some celebration, even if its simple.
[03:02] If you're insisting so much, for your sake,
[03:07] I'll arrange a dinner at home next Sunday.
[03:10] You can bring your family and I'll invite my family over and then we'll announce their betrothal then.
[03:21] Will that be okay?
This is absolutely fine. Thank you very much.
[03:25] Now please have tea.
Of course.
[03:55] What are you reading?
[03:57] There's an article on Kabeer Foods. Its very good. You should read as well.
[04:06] Did Hafsa bother you much last night?
[04:10] She did bother us a lot but its alright, she's a child. Children do such things.
[04:17] I had an idea she would do such a thing. Had I been home I wouldn't have let her go?
[04:21] Why wouldn't you? She's so cute and talks adorably. I enjoy her company.
[04:26] I enjoyed more than Kabeer.
[04:28] She's very attached to Kabeer.
She'll be attached to you in a few days too.
[04:32] Of course. Why not? I love kids. They talk so adorably.
[04:38] Kabeer was not willing to take her along because you weren't along and she'd bother us.
[04:42] He wanted to spend some time together but I insisted upon taking Hafsa along.
[04:49] If she insists next time, don't take her along. I will ask Kabeer to not accept every demand she makes.
[04:56] No. Please don't say anything to Kabeer.
[04:58] He loves her very much. He pampers her a lot.
[05:02] But kids should have some etiquette. Hafsa should know that all her demands cannot be fulfilled.
[05:08] I agree with what you're saying. A child should know that all her demands will not be met.
[05:16] Show me.
Yes read this.
[05:23] Alright. The restaurant's pictures are so good.
[05:33] Sir this file is being overlooked by Ms. Nawal but she hasn't been to the office.
[05:37] Tell me who should I assign it to. The clients' payment is on hold.
[05:47] Alright you go and send in the manager.
[06:20] Hello.
[06:24] Do you even realize that I've been waiting for you since morning?
[06:28] I went to the office for an important meeting. You do know dad isn't well, right.
[06:35] If you had to go to the office you should have told me, I wouldn't have to the university.
[06:40] You don't care about my love for you.
[06:47] Don't say that Nawal. I came here, leaving everything behind for your love.
[06:54] And by the way, I called you so many times why didn't you pick up?
[06:57] Don't you know I don't answer when I'm upset with you?
[07:01] I'm sorry. I'll hold my ears.
[07:07] I'm sorry. I'll never keep you waiting, ever.
[07:17] Lets go somewhere on lunch.
No. I want a fritter and cold drink from the canteen.
[07:22] Just a fritter and drink?
[07:24] Yes. I miss everything so much. You don't realize but the university,
[07:31] we, these classes, I'm missing everything. These are our memories.
[07:40] Alright. Lets go to the canteen then.
Lets go.
[07:47] Give me your back. Come on. Lets go now.
[08:01] Why hasn't Ms. Nawal joined back yet?
[08:03] Sir I called but she asked for some to think.
[08:07] What did I tell you? Insist that she joins back immediately.
[08:12] Do you even realize how many projects she was looking at?
[08:16] The company could incur a big loss.
I'm sorry sir. I'll call her again.
[08:20] You let it be now. You won't be able to get it done. You leave. I'll see to it myself.
[09:22] Nawal, Nausheen came. She wanted to hold an engagement but I said I wasn't in favor of it.
[09:31] I asked for some time to make preparations. We can have the wedding after six months.
[09:38] Did your hand get burnt?
No. It didn't get burned.
[09:42] You burned your hand. Get up and put ointment on it.
No. The tea wasn't so hot.
[09:46] But your hand is red. Get up and put ointment on it.
[09:49] No mom. I'm fine. What did Nausheen aunty say?
[09:55] Nothing, she wanted an engagement and I said no.
[09:59] We have a dinner on Sunday. Both our families will meet.
[10:04] We'll announce yours and Asjad's betrothal there.
[10:08] There won't be a lot of people. Falak's in laws, sister Fariha and brother Safdar.
[10:14] But aunt is in Islamabad.
Yes she is but I talked to Safdar, he said she'd be back.
[10:22] I'm worried about you. Go and put something on it. You'll get a blister.
[10:28] This girl is weird.
[11:05] Hello.
[11:07] Hello. Falak, I didn't expect this from you.
[11:11] You have forgotten your mother. You didn't even ask after me ever since you left.
[11:16] Mom you know how busy I am. I don't get time.
[11:21] I have dinner invites everyday. I get so tired.
[11:25] You don't get time to talk to your mother?
[11:29] Okay mom. Now tell me how are you? How is sister Nawal? How are you feeling?
[11:33] Thank God you at least asked about how I'm feeling.
[11:37] Please stop it mom. You know we have so many dinner invites everyday.
[11:42] I was just getting clothes out for the dinner tomorrow.
[11:45] I promise I'll call you everyday. Then you'll say I bother you everyday.
[11:51] Mothers are never bothered, dear.
[11:53] Children start feeling agitated.
[11:56] Mom, please stop it. I promise I'll come meet you in a day or two.
[12:02] I have so much to talk to you about.
[12:04] Even I want to see you, meet you and hug you.
So you could have come to meet me.
[12:12] How could I come? Mothers don't look good coming to their daughter's in law's house every other day.
[12:18] No matter how much they miss their daughters,
[12:21] mothers are bound by the traditions in the society.
[12:25] Stop it mom. You'll tear up yourself and make me cry too. Tell me why did you call me?
[12:32] I wanted to invite you. I have invited Nawal's in laws for dinner on Sunday so you and Kabeer should come too.
[12:42] I'll try.
[12:44] Try? Why try? You have to come, it is mandatory.
[12:49] Alright mom. I'll have to ask Kabeer once, maybe he might be busy as well. I'll try to come.
[12:58] Kabeer is calling me, I'll call you later.
Listen...
[13:31] sister Nawal, you here?
[13:35] I was going to the market so I thought I'd see you. These are for you. How are you?
[13:39] Thank you.
[13:40] How are you?
I'm fine, but how are you and how is mom?
[13:44] She's fine. She misses you very much.
[13:47] Yes I talked to her last night.
[13:51] But you see I have do much to do in the house and we have dinner invites every other day,
[13:56] Right now I was heading for the salon because we have a gathering to attend tonight.
[14:00] Nobody is so busy that they cannot take out time for family.
[14:07] Don't talk what mom said. She also said the same thing.
[14:13] You know we have to go abroad and I haven't even packed yet. There is so much to do. What should I do?
[14:20] Why are you standing? Come, sit.
[14:27] Tell me what will you have, tea, coffee, juice? Should I get you something?
[14:31] Will you not sit with me?
[14:34] No. sister Nawal. I told you have an appointment at the salon and if I miss it, I won't get one again.
[14:40] If only you had told me before coming, I would have told you not to come.
[14:44] You had to come here for no reason. I'm very busy.
[14:49] Alright, if you're getting late, you should go.
[14:54] I just came to remind you that Asjad's family is coming on Sunday so do come.
[14:59] Yes mom told me last night. Alright, I'll call you tonight. I'll leave now.
[15:20] Oh, Nawal..
[15:24] When did you come? I didn't even know.
[15:28] Just a little while ago.
[15:30] Why were you sitting all alone?
[15:31] No. Falak was with me, she just left. We had been talking for a while.
[15:37] How are you?
I'm fine. Where did Falak go?
[15:41] She left for the salon.
[15:43] Alright. Sultana aunty called. She told me you have been betrothed by the grace of God.
[15:49] I'm so happy for you. May God bless you with the best.
Amen. Thank you.
[15:55] So have you eaten anything or not?
Yes. I've had too much.
[16:01] Please sit for a little while.
[16:02] No, actually I had been sitting for a while. I'll take your leave, I'm getting late.
[16:08] It would have been great if you had sat down, but do come again.
I'll definitely come.
[16:15] Lovely, seeing you.
Likewise. Bye.
[16:17] I'm coming with you. I'll see you off.
[16:24] Hello. Hello
Hello.
[16:36] These are a few gifts for you and these are for Fizza and Raima.
[16:42] Why did you have to do all this? Its enough that you people came.
Falak, come sit.
[16:50] This is the traditional way of showing love, nothing else.
[16:55] So, how have you been?
[17:03] Hello.
Hello. May you live long.
[17:28] Keep these in the kitchen.
[17:34] How are you Aaliya? Congratulations, you got your brother in law married.
[17:38] Congratulations to you too.
[17:41] Meet her, she is the younger daughter in law of our house.
All praise to the Lord.
[17:45] Hello.
She's very pretty. May you live long and be happy. Sit down dear.
[17:52] Now tell me why didn't you come for the wedding?
What can I do dear?
[17:58] I cannot sit somewhere for long time. My legs start to hurt.
[18:03] Aaliya, tell her some good doctor. She trusts every advise you give her.
[18:08] Aaliya never gives me any wrong advice.
[18:11] This is your love.
May you live long.
[18:16] Where are Fizza and Rania?
[18:20] Fizza is in Islamabad and Rania is getting ready. She'll be here.
[18:24] Aunt?
[18:40] Thank you.
Falak are you bored?
[18:45] No. Not at all.
[18:50] Thank you.
[18:51] Falak why haven't you worn the gold bangles that Aaliya gave you on your wedding.
[19:05] Yes, actually they were so heavy and it hurt my hand so I took them off.
[19:10] You shouldn't have taken them off.
[19:13] They are your family heirloom. You would have gotten used to them in a few days.
[19:17] You should be mindful of your family traditions.
[19:21] Aaliya, you value your family values a lot. Why didn't you tell her? Did you forget?
[19:38] Its alright aunt, it happens. Falak is right.
[19:43] Those bangles are really heavy and I too had problems but I would ask mom and take them off.
[19:52] I've always seen them in your wrists, never without them.
[19:59] Oh, what are you talking about? Go and see if the food is ready.
[20:11] Now tell me when will you come to our place to stay over.
[20:16] I'm going back to Islamabad this week. I'll come the next time I'm here.
[20:21] I will wait for you. You'll have to come and for a long time.
As God wills.
[20:28] Hello brother Kabeer.
Hello. How are you?
[20:31] I'm absolutely fine. Congratulations on your wedding.
Thank you so much.
[20:35] Hello brother Touqeer, how are you?
[20:39] How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
[20:42] Absolutely fine. How are you my dear?
I'm absolutely fine.
[20:46] Hello, sister in law. How are you?
[21:30] If only you had told me before you came, I would have told you not to come over. I'm very busy.
[21:40] Asjad's family is coming over on Sunday for dinner to finalize the proposal.
[21:44] Yes mom told me last night. I'll call you tonight. Take care. Bye.
[22:01] Your coffee is getting cold.
[22:08] You worried me too much.
[22:12] What happened?
[22:13] You're always quiet. So lost. Are you worried about something?
[22:23] I'm not worried at all.
[22:27] Then why are you sitting here like this?
[22:30] I felt suffocated in my room so I came and sat here in the open air.
[22:35] A person feels suffocated only when there is suffocation inside.
[22:43] Are you not happy about this proposal?
[22:47] I'm happy.
[22:48] Then Nawal?
[22:52] Then its nothing. You're becoming over sensitive.
[23:05] Falak and I have bothered you very much.
[23:08] Not at all, daughters are like sparrows.
[23:14] Their chirps make the house come alive.
[23:22] Do you know, it seems like only yesterday, both of you were too young.
[23:31] You kept running here and there and now you're all grown up,
[23:35] ready to move into your new house.
[23:40] My house will become barren.
If you say I'll not get married.
[23:46] Have you lost your mind? We don't say that.
[23:50] We love it when our daughters are married. They don't stay at their parents' home forever.
[23:54] This is what our religion says and this is what our Prophet preached.
[24:01] Now drink it.
Its cold now.
[24:30] *Answer my calls I want to talk to you-
[24:53] *I'm sorry. There is nothing left to talk about-
[25:13] *Don't leave your job because of what happened between us. Please start coming to the office*
[25:55] How is uncle now, Hamza?
[25:58] He's been diagnosed with last stage cancer.
[26:02] Mom and dad are flying to London for his treatment.
[26:06] Of course you'll be going with them.
[26:11] I will be here for now but I'll have a flight after one week.
[26:18] I'll wind up some work in the office and then go.
So when will you be back?
[26:24] I cannot say anything right now. I'll know when I go there.
[26:28] So who'll handle the factory and office while you're gone?
[26:32] I'll hand it over to the team and I'll see what becomes when I go there.
Hamza..
[26:39] Don't worry, uncle will be fine with the grace of God. Nothing will happen to him.
[26:48] Yes hello?
[26:55] I will not visit any of your relatives on dinner invites now.
[26:58] Why? What happened?
[27:01] Why? Didn't you see? Your aunt just dragged me around because of those bangles.
[27:07] She's elder. What happened if she said something? Whats the big deal?
[27:12] Now you're siding with her as well Kabeer. Nobody cares for me.
[27:20] Falak, please. Come on, try and understand, Falak. These elders in the family,
[27:30] they value and understand the traditions.
[27:34] If you find the bangles heavy, don't wear them. Just wear them if we're visiting family.
[27:41] As it is, you're a new bride. Everybody has their eyes on you.
[27:46] Nobody had their eyes on me. Everybody was giving protocol to sister Aaliya.
[27:51] As if she's the newly wedded bride.
[27:53] sister Aaliya is very friendly with everyone and everybody knows her. Once you're friendly,
[28:00] there will be a time when everybody will give you protocol as well.
[28:03] I don't know when that time will come.
[28:07] Alright so when we are leaving for our honeymoon, Kabeer
[28:11] I think we'll get our passports by tomorrow or day after.
[28:14] Alright then transfer some money in my account, I want to go for shopping.
Shopping?
[28:24] You shopped before the wedding as well.
[28:28] They are such heavy dresses, I won't wear them abroad.
[28:32] Alright fine. You go ahead and shop. Happy?
[29:23] Nawal? Why are you standing here like this?
[29:29] So your car broke down. I'll drop you home. My guard will bring your car.
[29:35] No thanks. You go.
[29:38] Nawal don't be stubborn. You're standing by the road. It doesn't look good.
[29:42] Hamza I told you to leave. You don't have to worry about me.
[29:47] You know very well I won't leave from here.
[29:51] Alright fine, I'll stand here with you. We'll go together when your car is fixed.
[29:54] What is your problem Hamza?
[29:56] You know very well what my problem is? I cannot leave you like this on the road. 
[30:01] We can do one thing. Come with me. I'll drop you home.
[30:05] Or else both of us will wait here. I'll leave when your car is fixed.
[30:16] Your car is fixed, mam. Mam your car is old now. Sell it. I'll get you a good price for it.
[30:24] Alright. Thank you.
[30:59] Here, madam. We got our passports earlier than expected.
[31:03] Do we have our visas stamped?
[31:04] Yes. Oh wow. You've started packing as well.
[31:09] Yes. I shopped a little today so I kept them in.
[31:13] Oh, what have you packed? 
[31:15] We'll get everything where we're going and if you shop everything here, what will you do there?
[31:21] Don't worry. I just kept necessary items.
Okay.
[31:27] Kabeer, this.. You got tickets for next Sunday but I asked you we'd leave on this Sunday?
[31:36] How can we go this Sunday? Sultana aunty invited us for dinner this Sunday. 
[31:40] That's why I got the tickets for next Sunday.
[31:42] I have a few things to do so I thought alright.
[31:44] It was just a non formal dinner. Mom isn't holding an engagement. 
[31:49] Had we not gone, it wouldn't have made a difference.
[31:53] Falak, you're saying this? I'm amazed hearing what you're saying. 
[31:57] Tell me one thing, is Nawal really your sister?
[32:04] Yes. Why are you saying this?
[32:09] No, listening to you I feel Nawal isn't your sister by blood but a step sister.
[32:16] Alright, if you have a problem, I'll get the tickets exchanged.
[32:19] No. You're serious. I was just kidding.
[32:23] Why would I do that? In fact I told mom that I'd come and stay at her place a month before her wedding 
[32:29] and I won't let sister Nawal do anything and do everything myself.
[32:33] Really? Alright. We'll see that.
[32:37] Please drop me at mom's tomorrow. She'll have so much to do. I'll help her around.
[32:42] Okay.
[33:44] What happened? Why are you standing here?
[33:47] Don't you think these people are weird? They didn't get a ring but they didn't bring anything either.
[33:52] They came empty handed without anything.
[33:55] Mom said we didn't want any formal events.
[33:59] sister Nawal, mom said she didn't want anything formal. But they could have brought a dress or a dress. 
[34:06] We should know its the groom's family. They just came empty handed like guests. What sort of people are they?
[34:12] Falak, don't be loud. Someone will listen to you. It doesn't look good.
[34:16] Have you seen their dressing? Those women are so weird.
[34:21] Oh God, the guests they have along look like they got their makeup done from a cheap beauty parlor. 
[34:26] sister Nawal, think about it. Do you want to get married here?
[34:31] Don't be loud, someone will hear you. And if mom has no objections, why should we? 
[34:37] Don't judge people from their clothes and makeup.
[34:42] Who am I arguing with? How do I make you understand? We see people as they look and these people,
[34:48] look at them how old fashioned, backward and uneducated they seem.
[34:53] Now be quiet. Someone will hear you.
[34:56] Yes, I will just be quiet.
[35:01] Zakia? Zakia?
[35:16] Hello.
Hello. Sir I had to show you this file.
[35:46] I'll see to it. You go ahead.
[35:53] Sir, please have some sweets as well.
Whats the happy occasion?
[35:57] Nawal mam has been betrothed.
[36:45] Sultana you should have asked Nawal to take a leave and rest.
[36:50] You're right and I did ask her.
[36:54] But she said that she had taken so many leaves on Falak's wedding and had so much work pending so she had to go.
[37:00] To be honest Sultana, Nawal proved to be a son for you.
[37:05] In fact more than a son. 
[37:08] She took care of the entire house after your husband's death. Only fortunate people have such daughters.
[37:14] You're right. I'm very lucky. 
[37:19] Nawal got Falak educated.
[37:21] She found a job as soon as completed her studies.
[37:29] Falak and Nawal, both are very good daughters. May God bless them with good fortunes. 
[37:34] Do you know I always prayed to God.
[37:38] That God should give Nawal a very good family just like Falak and God has answered my prayers.
[37:48] Yes. Safdar was telling me they are good and sensible people.
[37:53] All praise to the Lord.
[37:56] Hello aunty. How are you?
Hello.
[38:05] Falak, sit with aunt, I'll just come.
[38:15] Oh aunt, you didn't come to my house. I kept waiting for you.
Why?
[38:21] Why were you waiting for me? Why would I come to your house?
[38:26] Come and see how I now own a beautiful palace. Someone you taunted all your life.
[38:34] That I had taken over their wealth like a snake. 
[38:37] Now come and see how I revel in luxuries in my own house.
[38:44] You called a servant's daughter. 
[38:48] Now come and see and you'll regret everything you said.
[38:53] If God has given you more than your worth, be thankful to God rather than being proud. 
[39:00] It doesn't take long to lose the ground beneath your feet.
[39:04] Really? How would I lose the ground beneath my feet?
[39:09] If I came to your in laws and told them,
[39:13] that you're not Sultana's daughter by blood.
