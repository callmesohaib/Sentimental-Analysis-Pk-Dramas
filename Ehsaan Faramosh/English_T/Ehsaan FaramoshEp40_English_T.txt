[00:15] You will not stay out so late again.
[00:20] What's with you, Kabir? Why are you putting restrictions on me like this?
[00:24] Falak if you don't take care of yourself, then I'll be forced to be strict.
[00:30] Right now Falak needs your love and attention.
[00:36] Ups and downs occur in business, but this should not affect your home.
[00:42] I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and it will always remain.
[00:46] I can never end that relationship.
[00:51] I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
[00:57] You know how hard Kabir has worked for this company. He works day and night for this company.
[01:03] He's very worried... will you talk to Hamza?
[01:16] Hamza, you withdrew your shares from Kabir foods?
[01:20] Yes.
[01:21] You didn't even tell me about it.
It wasn't important enough for me to tell you.
[01:26] You shouldn't have done this, they have lost millions because of you.
[01:30] I've lost millions as well, but I didn't blame them.
[01:34] You don't understand, their company is in crisis.
[01:38] I just learned that Sherazi has withdrawn his shares as well.
[01:42] Why are you so worried about them?
[01:44] What are acting like a child?
[01:46] He's Falak's husband, she's worried because of him. She's my sister and I'm worried for her.
[01:52] Look, this is business, it would be better if you don't involve yourself in this.
[01:57] Kabir is your friend as well, why are you ruining your friendship with him?
[02:02] We are relatives as well.
[02:06] Invest in their company again... they need you.
[02:11] Niwal... I have no intention of investing.
[02:13] Please don't force me.
I can't see Falak worried.
[02:18] Think that I'm asking you to do this. Will you not listen to me?
[02:24] Niwal, I don't have time for small businesses. I don't want to invest in Pakistan.
[02:31] I've decided that I'm moving my entire business to Canada.
[02:38] There are a lot of opportunities to move forward.
[02:43] What do you mean?
[02:46] What are you saying? Will you not come back?
[02:49] I will come back... but I will not wind up the business. My offices will stay here.
[02:55] Niwal I've decided that we'll shift here after the wedding.
[02:59] What? So that's why you don't want to invest here.
[03:04] Yes... that's why I don't want to invest in a new business in Pakistan.
[03:09] Hamza, you know that I don't want to go there.
[03:13] If I wanted to settle abroad with you, couldn't I have done that before?
[03:16] Niwal, my entire family is here, I can't leave them here.
[03:21] I'm forced to stay here.
You had no intention of staying there before.
[03:26] Now you want to stay there.
Try to understand Niwal.
[03:31] My sister is here... Naveen's schooling is here.
[03:34] Brother Raheel's business is here and I have to look after everything.
[03:37] Who will take care of them if not me?
[03:42] Please Niwal, you'll have to support me.
[03:45] My family is important to me like your family is important to you.
[03:51] Mother will be here alone without me. Who does she have apart from me?
[03:55] I cannot leave her alone here.
[04:00] Niwal...
Hamza, there is no point in arguing! You'll have to come back!
[04:08] Alright fine, we'll talk about this when I come back to Pakistan.
[04:14] Take good care of yourself... you don't need to think much about Kabir...
[04:19] Kabir and sister Aliyah are very talented, I'm sure they'll find an investor somewhere.
[04:25] Okay? Bye.
[04:48] What are you thinking?
[04:53] I'm thinking...
[04:56] If we get a major loan from somewhere, then all of our crises will end.
[05:04] That's true, there's no doubt about that.
[05:09] The problem is that we won't be able to find a big investor right now.
[05:14] We're going into a loss...
[05:17] Everyone can see that. No one will take the risk.
[05:22] The best option is to take out a loan.
[05:26] Alright... do what you think is right.
[05:33] I'll have the documents prepared, we'll apply at a few places.
[05:38] Let's see where we get it from.
[05:41] All we can do is hope for the best. I'll have coffee made.
[05:59] Hello Hamza, how are you?
[06:01] I'm fine, but I think that you're not fine.
[06:06] What do you mean?
[06:07] I keep business and family separate, and I expect you to do the same.
[06:13] If you wanted to talk, you could have talked to me. Why did you involve Niwal in this?
[06:20] I didn't involve her, who told you that?
[06:23] Niwal called me, who can tell her other than you?
[06:27] Hamza, we're friends and you know me. I didn't tell Niwal... Falak did.
[06:34] Why would I tell her?
[06:35] I removed the shares because of you and sister Aliyah.
[06:40] You shook hands with my enemy, hence I removed my shares.
[06:44] But that doesn't mean that you should involve our families.
[06:49] I asked Falak not to tell Niwal, but she didn't listen.
[06:53] I'm sorry if you took offense to that.
[06:55] Remember when I told you and sister Aliyah and Sherazi can't be trusted?
[07:01] But you guys didn't listen to me.
[07:04] Now regret the decision you took.
People make mistakes.
[07:09] Do you see what happens when you don't listen to me?
[07:12] Do you remember...
[07:14] when you needed me I stood by you. Everyone asked me not to.
[07:20] But still, I helped you...
[07:24] Don't make me remember your favors.
[07:26] I've already paid you back for those favors by investing millions.
[07:31] Which you withdrew.
[07:35] Hamza everyone thinks that you endured a loss, but you benefited from it.
[07:41] You sold the shares when the price was up, we're the ones who endured the loss.
[07:48] I think Sherazi is just an excuse, you had already decided to leave.
[07:56] I'm right, aren't I?
[08:00] I heard chameleons change colors, but for the first time, I'm seeing a human do it.
[08:08] Is money worth so much to you that you've forgotten about your relationships?
[08:16] Anyways... I've taken too much of your time, I'm sorry.
[08:22] From now on you won't be getting any calls from me.
[08:43] What happened? Why are you in a bad mood?
[08:48] Falak, I had forbidden you to discuss this with Nawal. Still you didn't listen to me.
[08:55] So what... sister Niwal is my sister.
[08:58] If I do not discuss my worries with her, then who will I discuss it with?
[09:02] What did we gain?
[09:04] You had no idea how embarrassed I was in front of Hamza because of what you did.
[09:09] I feel so small.
[09:12] Did Hamza say something to you?
[09:18] Hamza thinks that I'm using Niwal for my gain.
[10:07] Hello...
[10:09] Why weren't you picking up? I've been calling you for ages.
[10:13] I was busy..
[10:14] Were you busy, or were you ignoring me?
[10:17] If you can be busy, then why can't I be busy?
[10:21] I just wanted to talk to you...
[10:24] I was missing you. I feel seeing your face.
[10:28] I'll video call you.
I'm at a friend's house and I can't video call.
[10:36] Alright.
[10:38] Message me when you reach home, I'll call you.
[10:44] Bye.
[12:29] Many congratulations, God has blessed you with a daughter.
[12:32] Many many congratulations to you all!
Congratulations son!
[12:38] Thank you, doctor.
How's Falak?
[12:44] The mother and the child are in a good state. You guys can meet her shortly.
[12:49] Thank you, doctor...
Congratulations...
[12:53] You too brother Tawqir...
You're an aunt now
[12:57] Congratulations Kabir.
Thanks.
[13:03] Many congratulations.
[13:04] Many congratulations to you as well. After so many years...
[13:08] we've had a child born in our home.
[13:12] Many congratulations to you as well sister...
[13:14] Many congratulations to you as well... get something sweet for us!
[13:17] I'm sorry... I'll be right back.
[13:38] Falak... after all the worries that we've faced in the last few months...
[13:43] this is a major happiness.
[13:47] She is beautiful.
[13:50] Why are you crying?
Greetings.
[13:56] Greetings to you too...
Look she's trying to speak.
[14:02] Falak... many congratulations
Many congratulations!
[14:07] Mother, she has a Falak's face.
[14:11] She looks a bit like me as well.
May God give her health.
[14:21] Sister...
She's beautiful. May God protect her.
[14:28] May God give her success.
Amen.
[14:32] Hafsa was begging for us to bring her here.
[14:35] You should have brought her, she had been waiting.
[14:40] No way, she would have bothered everyone.
[14:42] She'll meet her once Falak returns home.
[14:46] What are you saying? Why would she return to her home...
[14:49] who will take care of her? She'll come with us. We'll take care of her.
[15:09] Kabir... I'll take Falak.
[15:12] It's a tradition of ours... after the delivery, the girl returns to her mother's home.
[15:18] Auntie... you'll be worried for no reason. Sister Aliyah is right, we'll take Falak home.
[15:25] I'll go home with my mother. I get stressed at sister Aliyah's home.
[15:39] Kabir, don't worry.
[15:42] Falak is my daughter and this is her right.
[15:47] It's alright... it's all the same. She just needs someone to care for her.
[15:54] It doesn't matter where Falak goes, we all are family.
[16:03] It's time to feed the baby.
[16:08] Sister Aliyah... give her the ghutti (first tonic given to infants after birth),
[16:12] I want my daughter to have some of your qualities.
[16:21] Thank you Kabir, but why me? Let Auntie give it to her.
[16:25] Or Falak should give it to her. A mother has the first right.
[16:32] Aliyah is right. Auntie, you should give it to her...
[16:35] besides elders have more blessings in their hands.
[16:51] Forget it, at least we tried...
Mother.... father!
[16:55] How are you, my dear?
I'm fine... mother, how was uncle's baby?
[17:01] She's fine... she's very cute.
Why didn't you bring her here?
[17:08] She's small, so the doctor asked us not to bring her here.
[17:15] Then take me to her...
Okay, we'll take you in a few days.
[17:21] Okay...
Come on now.
[17:24] Did you miss us?
[17:33] Hamza...
Yes?
[17:35] My dear, what are you thinking about? Is everything alright?
[17:41] It's nothing.
[17:44] Alright. Did you congratulate Niwal?
[17:48] No, about what?
[17:49] Falak just gave birth to a girl. Did Niwal not tell you?
[17:56] No.
[17:58] Aren't you talking?
[18:01] Yeah, it's been a few days... I was bust and she was upset with me
[18:07] I called her a few times, but she didn't pick up.
[18:11] Why is she upset?
[18:15] It's about us settling here.
[18:18] She's weird and I can't understand her.
[18:22] Girls dream of getting settled in such countries after getting married,
[18:26] but she doesn't want to leave Pakistan. I don't know what she wants.
[18:31] I told you that before you take a decision, discuss it with her.
[18:38] Mother... business is good here... there are more opportunities to move forward.
[18:44] My dear... every person has the right to make their decision.
[18:48] She has told you her decision and you have to accept it.
[18:53] What about you all? How can I leave you and your sister?
[18:58] I don't mind going to Pakistan.
[19:03] I don't want there to be a wedge between these two because of me.
[19:10] I already hold myself responsible.
[19:16] What about the business here?
[19:19] Should I leave it? People will think that I'm crazy.
[19:22] People will say that I'm leaving a gold mine for a coal mine.
[19:26] What are you saying?
[19:27] You have a successful business there as well,
[19:31] why don't you take care of them both? You can come and go, no one's stopping you.
[19:36] Mother's right...
Not at all... I'll keep this business.
[19:42] That one will be part-time... I'll go there when I need to.
[19:46] If Niwal is adamant about her decision, then I am as well.
[19:59] This is not how it is Kabir.
[20:01] Miss Aliyah gave me half the payment two months ago.
[20:05] After that, I heard nothing,
[20:08] even though she promised me that she would provide me with the money in the coming week.
[20:16] Please try to understand.
[20:19] I told you that we're going through a crisis.
[20:24] Trust me... you'll get your money soon. Give us more time.
[20:30] Look, I need to pay my salary. Where will I give it from?
[20:38] Try and understand my compulsion as well.
[20:43] By the way, almost a hundred of my men work in your restaurant.
[20:48] If they don't come, then how will your restaurant function?
[20:54] It would be better if you release me their salary,
[21:00] and so that things start moving forward for your business as well.
[21:05] You have until tomorrow.
[21:08] After that, I won't return.
[21:32] Get me the manager.
[21:34] Let me talk to my lawyer... Falak bring my phone, I'll call the lawyer.
[21:40] We'll get you anyone you want.
[21:41] Take him in!
[21:53] Don't worry Kabir. When a door closes, another opens.
[21:58] It seems to me that all doors have closed.
[22:02] Don't say that. Don't be upset.
[22:05] Falak, things might not be the same for us financially.
[22:10] Our life won't stay the same as well.
[22:12] I'm disappointed to think that I won't be able to give my daughter the life I imagined for her.
[22:19] What do you mean? What are you trying to say?
[22:22] We'll have to forego a lot of luxuries.
[22:26] My account is empty and all the payments are at a halt.
[22:33] I've applied for a loan from the bank, but if we don't get one, we'll be in default.
[22:38] What are you saying? Talk to sister Aliyah.
[22:41] I'm sure she has money... talk to brother Tawqir, and ask him to help us.
[22:46] Whatever sister Aliyah had, she had already invested.
[22:49] And brother Tawqir... we've taken his entire savings as well.
[22:54] Kabir, what will we do now? We have to figure out something, how can we spend life this way?
[23:00] The loss that we've endured... I don't see any way out of it, no matter how hard I try.
[23:08] Will we be poor now? Everything will be taken from us.
[23:12] Just think what the people would say...
[23:15] My friends are asking me to throw a baby shower... and I haven't done that as well.
[23:21] I've been stalling them for so long. What will I say to the people?
[23:27] Kabir...
[23:31] Do something... how will I spend my life without all these things?
[23:59] Yes sir?
Mr. Kabir, we have your arrest warrant.
[24:03] You'll have to come to the station with us.
[24:06] What is the arrest warranty for? What have I done?
[24:10] You'll know that when you come to the station. Come with us.
[24:15] Take him in!
Wait a minute... you are being unjust.
[24:20] Are we being unjust? You've taken people's money and haven't returned them for three months...
[24:27] Is that not unjust... take him in!
[24:31] Let me talk to my lawyer... Falak get my phone... I'll call my lawyer
[24:37] We'll get you anyone you want.
[24:39] Take him in!
Where are you taking my husband?
[24:43] Tell sister Aliyah about this.
Take him in!
[25:15] We have a major news for you...
[25:19] the owner of the biggest food chain in the country has been arrested today...
[25:30] Falak... has the police arrested Kabir?
[25:35] No... Kabir went himself... he wanted to discuss his case.
[25:41] I heard something else on the TV.
[25:43] It's nonsense, you know how the media exaggerates things.
[25:55] What will we do now? What must my friends be thinking?
[26:01] We won't be able to show our faces to anyone after this.
[26:04] Don't worry... just pray...
[26:08] that the police don't do anything to Kabir.
[26:13] You can't harass my client. Arresting him in front of his family...
[26:19] is embarrassing for him.
[26:21] We got the orders from above and we have a lot of pressure.
[26:24] Tell me, what should we have done?
[26:26] I have some brotherly advice for you... a formal complaint has been filed...
[26:31] You can either talk to him... or you can the bail order and I'll release Mr. Kabir.
[26:57] Sister, get me out of here.
[27:00] Don't worry, the lawyer is talking to them
[27:09] What happened? Did you talk to him?
[27:13] They are not willing to leave Kabir like this...
The SHO said that...
[27:18] there is pressure on him. But don't worry.
[27:22] Mr. Wahab has filed the complaint... we have to either talk to him... or...
[27:27] bring court orders.
[27:31] The time is over now... we'll have to wait till tomorrow.
[27:35] But try... the magistrate must still be there.
[27:39] Talk to Mr. Wahab...
[27:43] if he takes his complaint back, then something might happen. I'll be able to get Kabir out.
[27:48] As far as the paperwork is concerned I'll have it taken care of tomorrow morning.
[27:52] Mr. Wahab's number is off. I talked to his manager, he said that he's out of the city.
[28:01] Kabir, don't worry... it's only for one night. We'll get you out of here tomorrow.
[28:07] We'll have you bailed out tomorrow. Don't worry, we're here.
[28:13] Be strong...
We'll take care of everything.
[28:16] If God is willing.
[28:30] What happened? Did you bail Kabir out? Where is he?
[28:36] Falak, we weren't able to bail him out today.
[28:41] Why not? Will Kabir spend the night in jail?
Falak relax.
[28:48] It's only one night. He'll be bailed out tomorrow morning.
[28:52] Tomorrow morning... he's your brother and he loves you.
[28:56] You couldn't get him out... how can you leave him there?
[28:59] Control yourself Falak.
[29:01] All of this happened because of him... ever since I moved here, they've wanted something bad to happen to me.
[29:08] If you own half the business, then why should Kabir be the only one who is defamed...
[29:12] She should go to jail as well... have her arrested as well...
[29:15] Falak...
[29:18] Tawqir...
[29:20] Falak, what are you saying?
Aliyah, don't listen to what she's saying...
[29:26] She's angry, that's why she's saying this.
Enough my dear.
[29:31] Auntie, please make her understand.
[29:35] We know what we're going through seeing Kabir in jail.
[29:39] You had Kabir jailed so that I may be humiliated in my circle.
[29:46] Half the city knows that my husband is in jail. 
[29:50] I can't show my face to anyone... that's what you wanted, right?
[29:55] Aliyah let's go home... because there's no point in staying here.
[30:01] Kabir will be bailed out tomorrow morning.
[30:06] What kind of careless people are they?
[30:10] They ruined our honor!
Falak enough... come sit here.
[30:46] We shouldn't have gone there. She has no respect.
[30:52] What's with you? She was angry. 
[30:55] Don't make an issue out of that.
Are you kidding me?
[31:01] Didn't you see her behavior? She misbehaved with us.
[31:08] Tawqir, what we're doing is for Kabir. Forget about Falak.
[31:14] I'm serving dinner... go and change.
[31:39] Falak... you shouldn't have been rude to sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir.
[31:44] I wasn't rude... it's a fact. Kabir is in lock up because of them.
[31:51] I don't know if that's true or not. What I do know is that no matter what happens...
[31:58] one shouldn't let go of respect.
[32:02] Did you see how hurt brother Tawqir and sister Aliyah were?
[32:09] No matter how hurt they were, I don't care.
[32:14] Besides... only I know what I'm going through.
[32:19] Falak... my dear sister...
[32:23] Listen to me... call them and apologize. 
[32:26] What if brother Tawqir and sister Aliyah tell Kabir what happened when he gets out tomorrow?
[32:32] How hurt Kabir would be?
[32:34] I don't care about that, why would I call them?
[32:38] This is a mess they created.
[32:41] They should call me and apologize.
[32:43] Her husband is home... resting with a full stomach.
[32:47] We're the ones in pain. My husband is in lock up. I wonder how he must be.
[32:52] Alright, don't worry... Kabir will be back tomorrow.
[33:11] Go home... freshen up and rest. We'll come by in the evening.
[33:17] Won't you guys come inside?
[33:19] No Kabir... I need to attend a few meetings at work.
[33:24] Tawqir is right... you should rest.
[33:29] And don't worry. God willing everything will be alright.
[33:36] Brother... sister...
[33:41] Thank you so much...
[33:43] What's with you? Why are you acting like a stranger?
[33:47] Go on now... take care.
[33:53] Farewell.
[33:56] Aliyah, sit in the front seat.
[34:04] Take care... don't worry.
[34:07] We'll meet in the evening.
Farewell*
[34:30] Kabir, you're back. Are you alright? Did they say something to you?
[34:36] Are you okay?
I'm fine.
[34:44] Did sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir not come in with you?
[34:48] No... they dropped me off and left.
[34:52] Sister Aliyah had to go to the office and brother Tawqir was in a rush as well.
[34:56] Was he in a rush, or he didn't want to face me?
[34:59] What's with you? What are you talking about?
[35:02] Do you have any idea how hard last night was for me?
[35:05] I was alone here and there were all sorts of things going on in the news.
[35:09] My friends kept asking me all night about what was going on. 
[35:12] We can't show our faces anywhere.
[35:15] Do you see my state? I'm so worried and you're worried about the people
[35:48] Somewhere... what Falak said seems right to me.
[35:52] It was my idea to invest with Hamza... and partnering up with Sherazi...
[36:01] Kabir never said that I was wrong.
[36:06] Now it feels...
[36:10] that I shoved him off a cliff.
[36:16] I want time...
[36:19] to go back so that I may take both of my decisions back.
[36:27] Remember one thing... a word said... an arrow released and a decision made in business...
[36:36] can never be taken back.
[36:42] So be careful in the future.
[36:45]  We can't change what happened.
[36:47] I don't want to see Kabir in any problem.
[36:52] That's all.
[37:15] Kabir...
[37:20] There is a bad news.
[37:29] I've gotten used to listening to bad news.
[37:36] Anyways... what did you come here to say?
[37:39] The bank called... our loan request has been rejected.
[37:46] What?
[37:47] Sister... you said that the manager was hopeful that we would get the approval.
[37:53] Yes, but we didn't get the approval.
[37:57] We had one last hope and that's gone as well.
[38:02] We'll figure something out.
What will happen and how?
[38:07] It's been three months since we paid the workers. 
[38:10] The investors are threatening us with a case.
[38:14] What will we do now? I don't understand anything that's going on!
[38:21] Are you insane? How can this be?
[38:25] Why not? Try and understand... we need it!
[38:30] If you guys can't handle the business, wind it up!
[38:35] Free yourself and Kabir.
[38:38] Please... try and understand!
[38:43] Aliyah... you're acting like a child. We have invested everything that we had, apart from this home.
[38:50] And you want to offer this to the bank. This cannot happen.
[38:55] It's our family home, we were raised here and we have a lot of memories here.
[38:59] Tawqir...
[39:01] we need to do something to get out of this crisis.
[39:06] Trust me... it's just for a little while.
[39:10] As soon as things get better... we'll buy back the house.
[39:13] It's not that easy.
[39:17] I know... the decision is hard.
[39:21] But we don't have any other way. We applied for the loan... that was rejected...
[39:30] There are no new investors...
[39:33] To rebuild this business...
[39:38] Kabir has worked very hard.
