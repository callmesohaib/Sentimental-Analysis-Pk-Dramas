[00:12] I told you that you don't need to get worried for me.
[00:17] My life isn't easy!
[00:20] You think that my life was easy?
[00:22] You chose that life!
[00:25] Nobody forced you!
[00:27] Your dream was more important to you!
[00:29] This is why I feel ashamed.
[00:32] I chose my dreams over my relations.
[00:35] You should drop me to my home!
[00:37] Falak! Why don't you understand? I have to reach that place on time.
[00:41] Fine Kabir! Drop me here! I'll go home by cab.
[00:45] I won't call you after today and I won't ask you to meet me.
[00:50] You are forcing me! I feel like a burden to you.
[00:54] That's why you want to get rid of me.
[00:57] You are so stupid! Children are never a burden on parents.
[01:02] Why are you forcing?
[01:06] Falak is getting married because it was written for her. I'll marry when it's written for me.
[01:42] Me and Kabir planned a surprise for you!
[01:46] How's the surprise?
[01:48] You would've not thought that I'll be here for you.
[01:51] I didn't! I like it! Sister in law! You should have told me.
[01:55] If I told you already! What will be the surprise? How could we see that natural smile?
[02:03] Excuse me!
[02:08] Greetings!
[02:09] We are looking for dresses for wedding! It's her wedding. Show some nice designs.
[02:14] Come!
[02:17] Come!
[02:26] This is nice!
[02:37] Show this with the shirt!
[02:42] Kabir! Do you like it?
[02:53] This looks so beautiful!
[03:06] The design is so perfect! Do you like it?
[03:10] It looks nice!
[03:12] I like it too! Kabir! What about you?
[03:17] Yes! It's nice! The color is nice! Everything suits perfectly on Falak.
[03:23] Right!
[03:25] If Kabir likes it! We can choose this.
[03:29] She should try it once.
[03:32] No! Not before the wedding.
[03:36] I mean that she should wear it for the fitting! We should check it. I just want to see a glance.
[03:43] Sit! We are coming!
[03:45] Falak! Come and try it.
[03:52] Hamza!
[03:54] You told her to talk to me?
[03:57] Who?
[03:58] I'm shocked by such a weird action of yours.
[04:03] Our past was between us! Why are you including others?
[04:08] Navaal! Whom are you talking about?
[04:10] I'm talking about your sister.
[04:12] She talked to me about your proposal.
[04:15] What? Did she come to the office?
[04:17] She didn't just come here! She asked me the reason of rejecting your proposal.
[04:23] I'm sorry! I apologize from her side.
[04:26] Hamza! If you want to create a drama related to our past..
[04:32] and want to hurt me! I won't allow you to do that.
[04:38] You are misunderstanding! I cannot think about such a thing.
[04:42] I respect you a lot!
[04:43] I can see that!
[04:45] You really do respect me!
[04:48] We decided that we won't talk about the past.
[04:52] We won't talk to each other about it! Neither will we discuss it with somebody else.
[04:54] You call this respect that you are telling it to everyone?
[04:59] I just talked to her! I don't know what she thought!
[05:05] I'll talk to her and tell her that she doesn't need to discuss it.
[05:10] I don't trust you! You should know that our ways are separate.
[05:17] Ways cannot be forcefully joined!
[05:25] What did you do sister?
[05:34] Wear it!
[05:41] It looks nice!
[05:44] This looks so decent! Here! Try this.
[05:49] It looks good! See Kabir.
[05:56] If you like this! Let's choose this.
[05:58] Tell us what you like!
[06:01] Whatever you decide!
[06:04] She doesn't need to wear decent for her wedding!
[06:07] Lets see some other designs!
[06:10] We can see other designs!
[06:49] Where should I put this?
[06:52] Light it on fire!
[07:06] What are you looking at? Just put it!
[07:31] Sister in law! Sister in law! Everything is decided by Sister in law! Sister in law !
[07:37] Kabir can't help me on his own?
[07:43] It's my wedding and shopping is chosen by Aliya!
[07:47] Sure! My name is Falak!
[07:51] I'll get done with this Aliya!
[08:06] Sister! Why did you come to my office and talk to Navaal?
[08:11] Hamza! Somebody had to talk to her. I don't understand! Why are you so scared?
[08:18] I'm so surprised! How can a girl reject you like that?
[08:23] I just wanted to ask her that! But..
[08:28] I felt like!
[08:31] She didn't reject you because she likes somebody else! It's something weird.
[09:06] We had a break up.
[09:11] I know! What's the reason for the break up?
[09:17] It's me! I'm the reason.
[09:22] 5 years ago! When I shifted to London for business.
[09:28] I didn't tell her!
[09:31] That's why she broke up with me!
[09:34] What? are you in your senses?
[09:39] You didn't tell her about your departure?
[09:44] Hamza! You told her that you love her.
[09:48] On the other side! You didn't even inform her?
[09:54] Now I understand her feelings!
[09:59] Any other girl in the place of Navaal would've done the same!
[10:03] A girl never trusts a person who hides something important from her.
[10:08] Someone who lies.
[10:12] You broke Navaal's trust!
[10:15] I was scared! She would've stopped me from going.
[10:19] She would've forced me!
[10:22] I'm sure that if you had told her! She would've never stopped you.
[10:27] She would've been happy!
[10:30] That's my wrong!
[10:33] I left everything for money!
[10:38] Do you know? I used to walk in front of a shop in London.
[10:43] It was an antique shop.
[10:45] The things in that shop were sold for cheap because it people didn't know the value.
[10:53] The shop's owner used to tell me.
[10:56] The same people come to him to buy those things because they realized their value.
[11:01] It was late.
[11:06] Same happened with me!
[11:09] I'm back!
[11:12] But it's late.
[11:14] Hamza! Things don't have a comparison with people.
[11:19] Things don't have a heart.
[11:22] Humans have it!
[11:27] Things are precious but a persons love is priceless.
[11:35] Tell her about your regret.
[11:37] Go Hamza! Talk to her. She needs you.
[11:55] Mother! I can't find my wedding dress
[12:00] What do you mean? Where did you place it?
[12:03] I placed all the bags in my room.
[12:06] Go and look in your room.
[12:08] Mother! I've checked. It's not there.
[12:11] How is that possible? I'll ask Shaheen!
[12:15] Wait! I'll check again.
[12:19] What is she doing?
[12:21] She misplaces important things.
[12:29] Fresh and hot tea for you!
[12:33] I actually needed it!
[12:41] Did you visit the designer.
[12:43] No! I'll meet him.
[12:46] What's the hurry?
[12:47] Hurry? There are no days left in wedding.
[12:52] I'm joking Aliya! I've met him. Everything is looked after.
[12:56] Tell me about Falak's shopping.
[13:01] Yes!
[13:04] I don't know! I noted that..
[13:10] Falak stays quiet! She looks like she wants to speak but she doesn't.
[13:17] I don't know! You are having a misunderstanding.
[13:20] It can be possible! Some people are quiet.
[13:23] So maybe she is that person.
[13:26] But I felt like she was so happy in the start when me and Kabir surprised her.
[13:33] When we started to shop! She became so shy.
[13:40] Mother! Mother!
[13:42] Yes?
[13:43] It's not in the room!
[13:45] It's not? Where did it go Falak?
[13:51] Mother! Did it stay in sister Aliya's car? Did we forget it on a shop?
[13:58] I'm getting worried! It was an expensive dress.
[14:01] It's shocking!
[14:05] I'll call sister Aliya!
[14:07] Yes! Do it.
[14:09] I'm worried!
[14:15] Wait! Give me a minute.
[14:18] She is calling!
[14:23] Hello!
[14:25] sister Aliya! I wanted to talk to you.
[14:28] Is everything fine.
[14:32] That dress you bought for me! I can't find it. I'm worried.
[14:37] It'll be there! Where can it go?
[14:42] sister Aliya! All the bags are here. That particular bag is missing.
[14:48] I feel like we have forgotten it in a shop.
[14:51] You should ask driver to look for it in the car.
[14:56] But Falak! I gave that bag to you myself. How will it be with me?
[15:03] You should just check it one! It can be there.
[15:07] I would've found it if it was here.
[15:09] I'll look for it! Don't be worried.
[15:14] Don't be worried.
[15:16] It would be in the room.
[15:18] Mother! I've checked two times. It's not there.
[15:21] I'll help you find it.
[15:24] What happened?
[15:30] The wedding dress we bought.
[15:35] She can't find it! I'll go check it in the car.
[15:40] Go and look.
[15:44] Nasreen! Nasreen!
[15:47] Yes Ma'am!
[15:49] Ask the driver to check the car for any shopping bag.
[15:53] Sure!
[16:09] Ma'am! The driver is telling that there's no shopping bag in car.
[16:12] Fine!
[16:17] I remember that I gave the bag to Falak!
[18:25] Falak is worried about the dress.
[18:29] I'm worried about it too.
[18:33] I even checked the CCTV footage of shop.
[18:38] When exiting the mall. Shopping bag was in the hands of Falak.
[18:46] Falak's hand?
[18:49] You checked the CCTV? You didn't trust me?
[18:52] It's not like that! I trust you.
[18:56] I had to look because I wanted to know that the shop owner isn't lying.
[19:03] You have seen the CCTV.
[19:06] If I had cameras in house. I would've shown you the footage too.
[19:08] When I returned. I didn't have the bag.
[19:14] Did you guys stop in the way?
[19:16] We didn't stop.
[19:19] Falak! You should check your cupboard again.
[19:25] Mother! I've checked. I didn't find anything.
[19:28] sister Aliya! Ask your driver to look for the bag in the car. It'll be there.
[19:35] When you called! I did ask him. He checked properly. He didn't find anything.
[19:46] Where did it get lost?
[19:48] you've done so much of investigation, that people are checking CCTV.
[19:54] Where is it?
[19:57] It was so expensive! I liked it.
[20:00] What should I do? I can't find it.
[20:04] Falak! What is it?
[20:07] Control yourself Falak! everything will be fine.
[20:11] We'll find it! Don't you worry.
[20:16] I have to go for some important work.
[20:19] Take care! I'll try to visit again in the evening.
[20:23] Fine! Just don't cry.
[20:27] Goodbye!  Goodbye!
[20:38] Mother! Where did it get lost.
[20:41] Falak! Where can it go?
[20:44] It's the dress for wedding. You have misplaced it or somebody has picked it.
[20:51] You should check your room again! Do it properly.
[20:56] Mother! I don't remember. sister Aliya is mad at me too.
[21:01] She isn't mad! She is just worried.
[21:04] You should look for it again.
[21:08] I don't know mother.
[21:11] I should tell about this to Kabir! It's important to tell him.
[21:25] What is it? There's some problem everyday.
[21:31] Ma'am!
yes
[21:33] I want to tell you something.
[21:37] maam Falak burned those clothes. I saw her do it last night.
[22:08] Hello!
[22:09] Kabir! Where are you!
[22:11] I'm in office!
[22:12] I want to meet you. I'm coming to your office.
[22:15] Falak! Is everything fine?
[22:18] Yes! Everything is fine. I want to talk to you.
[22:21] Come! What is there to worry about?

[22:48] Did you tell everyone?
[22:49] Yes sir! Everyone is informed.

[22:57] Good! Does anyone have objection?
[23:00] Yes sir! Miss Navaal! She wants a leave.
[23:04] Her sister's wedding is near.
[23:09] No way! I can't give leave.
[23:13] Work load is more! Tell the employees about it.
[23:17] Right sir! As you wish.
[23:26] Falak! Why are you crying?
[23:29] What happened? Tell me!
[23:33] Fine!
[23:37] If you don't tell me! How would I know?
[23:45] Here!
[23:48] Tell me!
[23:50] Stop crying!
[23:52] The dress you bought for my wedding is misplaced.
[23:58] Why are you crying? Here! Drink water.
[24:02] It is something to cry! I told sister Aliya last night.
[24:07] But today she checked the CCTV! Like she didn't believe.
[24:14] Everyone is blaming me.
[24:16] I'm not a kid that I'll misplace my wedding dress.
[24:21] It's nothing! Just stop crying.
[24:26] Control your tears and drink water.
[24:32] sister Aliya came to house and she was interrogating me.
[24:36] I felt so ashamed.
[24:39] She went because she was mad. What will I wear on wedding?
[24:43] Where will I get the dress from?
[24:46] Falak! I think you are overreacting.
[24:49] It's just a dress! We'll buy a new one.
[24:53] It's a wedding! Obviously we have to arrange it.
[24:57] You can go with sister Aliya! Buy a new dress. Simple!
[25:02] I won't say anything to her! How can I?
[25:05] How can I ask her for it again? I can't!
[25:09] Fine! You should relax.
[25:12] You should come with me for shopping!
[25:15] Happy?
[25:17] No! Leave it.
[25:19] I'll ask sister Navaal for it! She'll find a way.
[25:25] What is it? Why are you asking her?
[25:29] In fact I would like it when you join me for shopping.
[25:33] Trust me!
[25:36] Please relax!
[25:38] As you say!
[25:42] This is what I'm talking about! Just smile.
[25:51] Ma'am! I want to tell you something.
[25:55] Speak!
[25:57] Falak burned her wedding clothes last night.
[26:05] I saw her with my eyes!
[26:07] What are you saying? Are you mentally stable?
[26:10] I'm totally fine! I saw her when I woke up last night to drink water.
[26:16] You can see it yourself! Come with me.
[26:23] Come!
[26:25] Set your mood! Eat properly. Here!
[26:32] Falak!
[26:34] I don't want to see you crying.
[26:42] What should I do? I couldn't understand.
[26:47] Really? What about me?
[26:50] I couldn't understand! How could I handle you?
[26:54] How could I tell you? I was worried for you.
[26:57] Who else would I tell?
[26:59] Everybody was blaming me.
[27:02] I thought that only you will understand me.
[27:07] otherwise...  Kabir!
[27:10] sister Aliya would think that I'm so immature.
[27:15] I feel scared.
[27:17] Falak! No need to be scared of sister Aliya.
[27:23] I trust her that she has nothing in her heart for you.
[27:27] That's why you shouldn't think like this.
[27:32] Just relax!
[27:34] OK?
[27:38] Thank you!
[27:41] Eat quickly! We are late. We took a lot of time for shopping.
[28:10] Greetings!
Greetings!
[28:19] Mother! Is everything fine? You look worried.
[28:24] Yes! Everything is fine.
[28:29] Tell me!
[28:35] The dress that Falak lost.
[28:39] Shaheen saw her burn it!
[28:47] Falak burned it! After that..
[28:50] She said that it's lost.
[28:54] Why?
[28:57] What is Shaheen saying?
[29:00] Falak bought it herself! Why would she do such a thing?
[29:04] I don't know anything!
[29:10] Mother! You don't trust me? Why would I do such a thing?
[29:14] It was my wedding dress! I chose it! Why would I burn it?
[29:21] You are trusting her?
[29:24] Let me call her.
[29:26] Shaheen! Shaheen!
[29:31] Yes ma'am?
[29:32] Here! Did you see me burn the dress?
[29:35] Ma'am! You were burning something.
[29:38] I don't know if it was the wedding dress.
[29:40] You saw me burning it?
[29:43] Ma'am..
[29:44] Why did you tell mother that Falak burned her wedding dress.
[29:50] Mother! She is lying.
[29:54] I was so worried.
[29:56] I remember that when I reached home! I gave the bags to her.
[29:59] She would've misplaced it and when she saw us finding it.
[30:03] She would've burned it.
[30:06] Ma'am! I didn't burn it.
[30:08] Why would I burn your dress?
[30:11] I don't know about it.
[30:13] Don't trust her tears.
[30:15] Call the police! She'll speak the truth in front of them.
[30:19] Forgive me! I didn't see anything.
[30:22] Just forgive me! Don't call police.
[30:24] Call the police! She can steal anything big tomorrow. Just kick her out.
[30:31] Get out! Don't come back to this house.
[30:37] Get out!
[30:43] Mother! I don't want to see her here again.
[30:46] Mother! You trusted her over me? How can I do this?
[30:52] Darling! I trust you. I was just worried.
[30:58] Please mother.
[31:13] Kabir! I was calling you. I was so worried.
[31:18] My phone's battery was low! Phone was powered off.
[31:22] Where were you?
[31:24] I went to give my measurements for dress and shopping.
[31:27] Who did you take for shopping.
[31:29] I bought a new dress for Falak!
[31:33] Is her mood alright?
[31:35] Yes! It's fine.
[31:38] I wanted to ask that what was the need for the investigating and the CCTV.
[31:42] Checking the footage doesn't look right.
[31:45] I just did it because I was worried for the dress.
[31:52] Falak was worried! I went to see the CCTV for her.
[31:56] But still Falak told that It's misplaced.
[32:01] You should listen to her.
[32:03] Actually! She was ashamed of herself.
[32:06] Obviously! She is the daughter in law in this house. She was thinking that we will think bad for her.
[32:11] I think that it was weird.
[32:14] I didn't want her to feel ashamed.
[32:19] I was just..
[32:20] Kabir is right! You didn't need to do that.
[32:25] I'm worried that Falak would be thinking bad about us.
[32:30] Whatever happened! Forget it.
[32:33] It's that she respects you a lot! She was thinking that you would be mad at her.
[32:40] But I told her to keep her heart pure.
[32:45] It's good that you told her!
[32:50] If you call her! She'll like it and feel normal.
[32:58] Fine! I'll go charge my phone.
[33:48] Greetings!  
Greetings!
[33:50] How are you, sir!
[33:51] I'm fine! How are you?
[33:53] Good!
[33:55] Anything new?
[33:56] Sir I'll show you! Sit please.
[34:01] Show me something special.
[34:04] Sure!
[34:12] Here!
[34:17] Should I serve you coffee?
[34:19] Thank you! no need for formality.
[34:26] It's good but..
[34:28] It's not what I'm thinking.
[34:31] You are not understanding. Something very unique for someone very special.
[34:35] Sir! This is the best. Nobody has such designs.
[34:39] Still! Do you having something very special?
[34:43] I'll show you.
[34:53] Sir! this is extremely unique.
[35:04] This is the one.
[35:08] Pack this one! Thank you!
[35:20] Wow! I remembered her and she called.
[35:24] Everything fine? You are feeling romantic.
[35:27] Sir here!
[35:29] Thank you so much.
[35:37] I bought a special thing for a special person.
[35:43] It'll remind her my love.
[35:47] Tell me about it.
[35:49] I can't tell! It's a surprise.
[35:53] Kabir! It's bad. You told me half. I'll be worried.
[35:58] I don't know! Show me.
[36:00] Sure! let me take your worries off. I'm sending you the picture.
[36:05] Sure! I'm waiting.
[37:23] I talked to sister. I was ashamed.
[37:29] OK!
[37:55] I told you that we have separate ways.
[37:59] But you told that you have forgiven me!
[38:02] That doesn't mean that we are same like before.
[38:07] I can't live without you.
[38:09] I don't trust you Hamza!
[38:14] You have left me before! You can do that again.
[38:20] That's why I can't marry you.
[38:23] Listen to me!
