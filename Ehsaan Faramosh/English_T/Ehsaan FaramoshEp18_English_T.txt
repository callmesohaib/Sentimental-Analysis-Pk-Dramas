[00:12] File was with you and documents are found from your drawer.
[00:19] You spoiled everything but blaming someone else.
Kabir.
[00:23] I will reject this proposal in front of everyone.
[00:25] Will you humiliate your mother in front of everyone for that stranger girl? Have you gone crazy?
[00:32] She is not stranger. I love her.
[00:35] Do whatever he says.
[00:38] Marry him to the girl he wants to get married.
[00:42] Forcefulness will be of no use.
[00:44] And now I am telling both of you that don't worry, I will take complete care of sister.
[01:15] Falak, is everything alright? You are calling at this time?
[01:20] How can everything be alright if sister Aliya is here?
[01:24] Will you tell me what happened or just keep crying like this?
[01:29] My friend invited us on dinner.
[01:32] We were going there that sister Aliya started her dramas.
[01:37] What happened? What has she done now?
[01:41] Nothing has happened, when we were leaving for dinner then sister Aliya fainted and Kabir canceled the dinner.
[01:48] I felt so embarrassed in front of my friend, she has taunted me so much, do you know that?
[01:53] What happened Falak? Is everything alright?
[01:56] What had to happened? Nothing has happened.
[01:58] She needs attention of whole family and she got that.
[02:02] How could she bear that me and Kabir were going alone for dinner?
[02:07] Falak why does you become so negative always?
[02:10] It is possible that she was actually not feeling well.
[02:14] Everyone is not straight forward and simple like you.
[02:16] Often people not get deceived but they deceive others.
[02:20] Ever since I have come here, I never spent a single day peacefully in this house.
[02:24] There has been a new drama happening everyday in this house.
[02:26] Falak, be careful she is elder than you.
[02:30] What if she is elder than me, do I ride her on my head?
[02:33] Kabir doesn't listen to me due to her and now you are favoring her.
[02:38] With whom do I share my grievances?
[02:41] OK fine, don't worry. Me and mom will come to see sister Aliya tomorrow.
[02:47] We will talk to brother Kabir to give you your right.
[02:51] No, there is no need to do that she is already flying very high.
[02:56] OK, we wont talk to anyone but you should talk to him yourself. Don't be rude to anyone.
[03:01] But tell everyone about your concerns.
[03:05] OK, someone is calling, let me talk to you later.
[03:26] Falak called me, sister Aliya is not feeling well.
[03:31] She was very upset because of sister Aliya's behavior.
[03:36] What happened to her? I am surprised, Aliya doesn't seem like that.
[03:42] She is bothering Falak.
[03:46] She got fainted so we should go there to see her.
[03:50] And if Falak has some grievances from her then you should talk to her about that.
[03:55] This is not the right way to bother Falak and make her life hell.
[03:59] You are right, I will go and talk to her.
[04:04] But this time is not appropriate. I will talk to her at some appropriate time
[04:13] Well listen Nawal, what about your interview that you gave?
[04:18] Interview went well, now let's see how do they respond?
[04:23] God will do better.
[04:26] Oh, I remember.
[04:28] You know my friend Naheed who lives in Germany.
Yes.
[04:34] She called me.
[04:35] She was asking about you.
[04:38] Actually she wants to bring her son's proposal for you.
[04:45] What?
Yes, he is a good boy.
[04:49] He is well educated and he owns his own business.
[04:53] But I told her that I will talk to Nawal first then I will tell her.
[04:59] Mom can't we talk about any other topic except marriage?
[05:03] You have started to discuss about proposals again.
[05:08] I think I am a burden on you.
[05:11] What are you talking about?
[05:14] Why will you be burden on me?
[05:17] And will we not allow any good proposal to come here and refuse that?
[05:22] A wrong experience doesn't mean that we won't let any good proposal come here.
[05:29] I want to fix your marriage to a good family before this matter get disclosed in the social circle.
[05:36] What's the harm in this?
[05:38] Mom, I don't want to think about my marriage at the moment. Please refuse them.
[05:55] Do you need anything else madam?
[05:57] No, I will tell you if I need anything. Go.
[06:06] By the way, your acting skills quite good.
[06:16] For a moment I felt that you have got a heart attack for real.
[06:22] I don't want to argue with you. I am not feeling well.
[06:27] I am not fond of talking to you as well.
[06:31] I have come here to discuss something important.
[06:37] If you feel that you will control my husband as well just like you are controlling this house.
[06:42] So let me tell you that I won't let you do that.
[06:44] Why are you doing all this? What's the problem with you?
[06:48] What problem can be with me regarding you?
[06:52] I just want you to stop interfering in mine and my husband's lives.
[06:57] And let us live our life with our own wishes.
[07:01] And as you do trap Kabir by black mailing him emotionally.
[07:06] Let him free.
[07:10] And sister don't consider this as my warning.
[07:15] I know how to get my right.
[07:52] Mom.
Hmm.
[07:56] So what have you decided? When will you go to aunt Sultana's house?
[08:00] You are standing in front of me because of a girl's love.
[08:05] Mom you are intentionally taking this matter seriously and egoistically.
[08:09] I have told you a thousand times that I don't like Areej.
[08:13] So how can I marry someone whom I don't like?
[08:17] It's not logical.
[08:19] Please try to understand my point.
[08:21] This matter is not for a few days it's a matter for whole life.
[08:25] No, you should try to understand my point. Will you get rejected again and again from same place?
[08:31] And I don't want to request same girl again and again.
[08:36] Listen, that was not Nawal's fault. That was your son's fault and you know that very well.
[08:44] I made a mistake and I have faced it's consequences.
[08:48] And now I want you to fight for your son's case. I want to marry Nawal only.
[08:55] But I have a condition as well.
[08:57] If they refuse again then without making any excuse you will have to marry Areej.
[09:11] Why are you quiet? Do you accept it or not?
[09:19] I love Nawal.
[09:21] She is my happiness.
[09:26] And you will try your level best to give me my happiness.
[09:30] That's it.
[09:52] I am not fond of talking to you. I just want you to stop interfering in mine and my husband's lives.
[09:58] I won't let that happen. Don't consider this as my warning.
[10:01] I know how to get my right.
No. No.
[10:04] Aliya, what happened?
[10:08] Calm down. Calm down. Look at me. Look at me. What happened? Have you seen a bad dream?
[10:15] OK relax. Get relax.
[10:25] Toqeer, this worry will kill me.
[10:30] I am seeing weird dreams.
Aliya dreams are not real.
[10:35] Dreams are not connected to reality so don't worry about those.
[10:44] Will you tell me, what is going on in your mind?
[10:51] How do I tell you?
[10:54] A scare is developing inside me.
[10:58] I am surrounded by a scare from everywhere.
Which scare Aliya?
[11:04] What happened to you suddenly Aliya? Why are you worried?
[11:08] You should talk to me right.
[11:11] Aliya you were never that weak.
[11:14] Toqeer, I have loved Kabir like my real brothers.
[11:21] I always took care of him as my younger brother.
[11:27] I loved him so much.
[11:30] I am afraid that he will get away with us and he will leave us alone.
[11:36] Why are you thinking so weirdly?
[11:39] Why will Kabir leave us alone?
[11:43] Falak is trying to get him away from us.
[11:47] I feel that this connection of our relation will be broken. What are you talking about Aliya?
[11:55] I am sorry but I don't understand anything.
[11:59] But I understand everything very well.
[12:03] I remember it very well that I put that file on the table after reading.
[12:13] I didn't unbind that file and I didn't pull off any paper from that file then how did those documents go to my drawer?
[12:20] Either Falak herself put there anytime.
[12:23] Falak
[12:31] Toqeer, I have remembered.
[12:38] Yes, I have remembered that she brought tea for me that day. I came out from washroom
[12:46] then I saw her face was paling.
[12:50] She must definitely put those documents in my drawer and I also believe that she also spoiled my dress.
[13:01] OK, if you are so sure Aliya then why did you apologize?
[13:09] Toqeer, sometime we apologize because the person who stands in front of us is very dear to us.
[13:19] We are afraid of losing him and stopping him to go away we apologize for the sin we don't commit to save our relation to be broken.
[13:35] OK, I agree with you that all of that has done by Falak.
[13:40] But the question arise here is that why would Falak do that and what would she get by doing that?
[13:48] She wants to create misunderstandings among all of us and this is her objective.
[13:56] And she is getting success in her objective.
[14:03] I think you should stop thinking about Falak and lessen the burden of you work as well.
[14:11] It's my advice for you. You not only need peace but also some vacations.
[14:20] Let's do one thing, let's go to a good doctor tomorrow.
[14:26] Toqeer?
OK, just take rest now.
[14:59] Falak is trying to him away from us. I feel that this connection of our relation will be broken.
[15:08] She brought tea for me that day. I came out from washroom then I saw her face paling.
[15:15] She must definitely put those documents in my drawer and I also believe that she also spoiled my dress.
[15:32] I will have to do something. This woman won't spare me that easily.
[16:07] Here is hot tea for you.
[16:11] Hey, it was not needed, you bothered for no reason my child.
[16:15] I like to do work for you. Don't say that.
[16:19] Thank you.
[16:26] Brother Toqeer, I want to talk to you about something.
[16:29] I am hesitant whether talk to you or not about that.
[16:34] Tell me clearly whatever you want to say.
[16:42] Sister Aliya have suspicions in her heart about me.
[16:47] I always try that no one will have any complains against me. I try to take care of everyone.
[16:54] And whatever happened during past few days, I forgot that but sister Aliya didn't forget that.
[17:00] She taunts me all the time.
[17:03] I keep listening to her quietly for the sake of this house and Kabir.
[17:09] And I don't say anything to anyone.
[17:14] So that there is no misunderstanding or unrest in the house. But today the limit has been crossed.
[17:23] I took food for her but she threw the tray on wall
[17:29] and said that I won't eat food cooked by you. You might put poison in it.
[17:33] I felt so embarrassed that I can't tell you.
[17:37] Falak, my child please don't cry.
[17:41] OK
[17:43] Calm down. I will talk to her and make her understand.
[17:46] Sister Aliya feels that I am getting Kabir away from her.
[17:50] Tell me why will I do that? Why will I get Kabir away from her?
[17:56] I never talked to Kabir about it so that he don't think that I am talking against sister Aliya.
[18:02] That's why I don't say anything to anyone and I don't tell anything.
[18:07] Listen Falak, she is not feeling well.
[18:11] This is the only reason of such behavior of her with you. Don't worry she will get well.
[18:18] I am sorry whether I should say this to you or not that you should consult a good psychiatrist for sister.
[18:25] I think she is suffering from some mental disorder. Please get her treated.
[18:29] Hey no, there is no such thing she is absolutely fine. She is just under some mental stress.
[18:36] All she needs is a break and that's it.
[18:39] Brother Toqeer, you can ask Kabir.
[18:42] Tell him whether I have ever said anything regarding or against sister Aliya?
[18:51] No never.
[18:56] Now tell me brother Toqeer, what should I do that sister trust me?
[19:02] OK please don't worry. I will talk to her and make her understand to correct her behavior with you.
[19:14] By the way, misunderstandings cause weakness to relations.
[19:21] I try all the time that there is no weakness in relations.
[19:26] And I expect this from you as well.
[19:31] OK fix your mood now. And you have made very good tea. Thank you so much.
[19:50] Isn't Doctor Sohail a psychiatrist? Have you brought me here to him?
[19:56] Listen Aliya, the condition you are in at the moment, you need mental peace.
[20:02] Tell me clearly what do you want? What do you want to do with me?
[20:33] What are you thinking Kabir?
[20:36] What were you discussing with brother Toqeer? What were you saying to him?
[20:44] Nothing.
[20:52] Are you sure?
[20:58] Why am I feeling that you are hiding something from me?
[21:05] Falak, tell me what's the matter?
[21:11] No Kabir, there is no such thing. I don't want to create misunderstandings among our family.
[21:22] Brother Toqeer was talking about it. He thinks that sister Aliya fell ill because of me.
[21:34] And he said that didn't I put those documents in the drawer to create misunderstandings between you and sister Aliya.
[21:46] But I clearly denied that why would I do that?
[21:50] I don't know why everyone is blaming me again and again?
[21:55] Tell me why would I do that? Take me oath I didn't do any such thing.
[22:02] This topic is becoming toxic day by day.
[22:05] I will talk to brother Toqeer. Rather brother Toqeer should have talked to me.
[22:10] I don't know what is going on in the house?
[22:13] No Kabir please.
[22:15] You won't talk to brother Toqeer about this topic. I don't want to create misunderstanding in our relationships.
[22:22] I don't want the matters to get more worst in the house. You won't talk to him about it.
[22:28] Listen Falak, you are part of this family.
[22:33] And most importantly you are part of my life.
[22:38] You have same value and respect as all other family members of this house have.
[22:45] And in my opinion this confusion should get away now.
[22:50] Kabir I know. But I am sure that one day sister Aliya will realize everything and everything will be fixed.
[23:44] Aliya everyone is worried because of your health condition.
[23:48] And to be honest, I am also worried now.
I know.
[23:57] You didn't tell me that where are we going?
[24:02] To doctor. I want to get a complete medical checkup of yours.
[24:46] Greetings, I have an appointment with Doctor Sohail in the name of Toqeer Ahmed. Let me check sir.
[24:56] Sir please wait for a few minutes. I will call you.
OK
[25:02] He is asking us to wait.
[25:04] Listen, isn't doctor Sohail a psychiatrist? Hmm?
[25:09] Have you brought me here to him?
[25:11] Listen Aliya the condition you are in at the moment, you need mental peace.
[25:17] I don't have any mental issue. Are you considering me mad?
[25:20] What happened to you? Relax. When did I say that you are mad?
[25:25] There are some weird thoughts come to our mind due to some worries with bother us.
[25:31] He sees some illusions and sees the things which actually don't exist.
[25:36] So wouldn't it better to get it checked? There is no harm in it.
I don't have any illusion.
[25:42] I am confident. You don't believe me but I believe myself. Why don't you understand my point. Relax.
[25:50] Aliya you were never that much helpless.
[25:54] You have faced the difficult situations very bravely.
[25:59] Have you remembered, when you came to our house first time after our marriage.
[26:06] Mom was ill.
[26:09] You have managed everything very brilliantly, mom's illness, taking care of Kabir and household chores.
[26:17] The situation was different at that time. Everyone was me then. Everyone is with you at the moment too.
[26:23] If you would have been with me then you wouldn't bring me here. If you don't believe me then who else will believe me?
[26:29] Aliya, Aliya, Aliya
[26:32] Where are you going?
[26:35] I am going home. I am not a mental patient.
[26:44] Falak said that you are not feeling well but you are looking absolutely fresh by the grace of God.
[26:50] I am absolutely fine. Falak was worried for no reason.
[26:59] When did you come?
[27:02] We missed you so we came here to meet you.
[27:07] Falak ask Nasreen to bring something for them.
[27:11] Yes I will ask her.
Falak there is no need for that.
[27:15] Why it is not needed? You have come here after a long time. I won't let you go without eating.
[27:21] Falak please ask her. Rather stop. Nasreen, Nasreen.
[27:31] Yes madam.
Please serve lunch on table.
[27:35] OK
[27:41] Aliya I want to discuss something with you. I hope you won't mind.
[27:47] Falak told me that there were some misunderstandings between you and Falak during past few days.
[27:58] Me and Nawal literally felt very sad by knowing that.
[28:02] Because we think that you are a very sensible woman.
[28:06] And you will ignore the minor domestic issues rather than exaggerate those.
[28:13] Just leave it mom. Whatever happened, has happened. It's useless to discuss that. Come let's have lunch.
[28:21] Hold on Falak.
[28:26] I can understand. You are her mother. It's obvious that you must get worried.
[28:31] Falak is just a child.
[28:35] If she would be sensible then these internal things wouldn't go out from the boundary walls of this house.
[28:50] But you didn't give proof of sensibility as well. I also considered you very sensible.
[29:01] You believed on one sided point of view.
[29:05] But I apologized to Falak unconditionally.
[29:19] If I would exaggerate things then I don't know how much fuss would have been created?
[29:26] But I took care of my house and my family members.
[29:31] And put my ego in Falak's feet.
[29:44] Tell them about this as well Falak.
[29:53] Falak has manipulated you just like she has manipulated Kabir and Toqeer.
[30:03] What has Falak done?
[30:05] It would be better if you ask Falak about that. Tell them Falak.
[30:15] Tell them Falak. Hmm?
[30:19] All of that which you have been doing to me.
[30:22] From saying weird things about me, spoiling my dress and pulling off documents from the file to get me embarrassed and tell them everything.
[30:31] So that your mother and sister should know that how thankless you are.
[30:41] What are you talking about?
[30:45] To make a house and keep it in tact requires a lot of effort.
[30:49] So many sacrifices are required. Houses can't made without any effort.
[30:53] But to break that one has to create walls of misunderstandings and everything breaks all of a sudden.
[30:59] And your daughter is doing the same thing these days.
[31:08] I arranged her marriage with so much love and respect.
[31:14] But now I am regretting so much on my decision.
[31:20] I am sorry, if you feel bad about my words. Because we give so much respect to our guests.
[31:27] But since you started the discussion so I had to respond to you forcefully.
[31:32] Else I wouldn't have discussed it with you.
[31:41] Falak... What I just listened?
[31:48] I don't want to talk to you at the moment. Please go home. I will talk to you at home.
[31:52] But you used to say..
Mom stop it. I don't want to discuss this.
[31:55] I don't want any drama in this house anymore.
[31:57] Please go from here.
[32:16] Let's go home.
[32:37] Have aunt Sultana and Nawal gone?
Yes they had gone at the same time without eating.
[32:43] And where is Falak?
She went out in car just a while back.
[32:49] OK go.
[33:25] What was the need to come to my home?
[33:41] Falak in which tone are you talking to mother?
[33:43] So what do I do? What do you think that everything is alright?
[33:48] Sister Aliya was taunting me freely. I kept quiet to save you from further insult.
[33:54] Listen to me Falak.
[33:56] You said to me yourself that Aliya has made your life a hell
[34:01] She doesn't let you live peacefully. I was worried and I had to talk to her.
[34:09] OK, sit here and talk calmly.
[34:11] Nothing changed, nothing got fixed. Rather I have got more worries because of your visit to my house.
[34:18] I am saying it right.
[34:20] Earlier you had objection on this proposal and you didn't want to marry me there 
[34:23] and now if sister Nawal is not getting married then you are taking revenge from me.
[34:36] Why are you mentioning my marriage? 
[34:39] Why are you dragging me into this discussion? 
You took her there.
[34:43] Tell me clearly today that what do you want? What do you want to do with me?
[34:48] Listen to me Falak.
[34:50] Nawal forbade me to go there. I went there myself to meet you.
[34:54]  Now don't mention Nawal's name in this matter. Do you understand?
[34:57] Yes, why will you listen because she is your real daughter?
[35:07] I have understood everything. But if my house will be unsettled because of you then I will never forgive you.
[36:07] I used to consider you very intelligent.
[36:11] But my daughter turned out to be very impatient.
[36:14] Why have you taken Falak's words that seriously?
[36:18] I am human being as well. My heart feels sorrow as well
[36:22] But if I don't say anything to her then it doesn't mean that she can say anything to me.
[36:27] You know her nature. She gets angry suddenly.
[36:32] Did you go there for yourself? You went there for her betterment.
[36:37] She told us that her life has become hell but whatever she said today hurt me a lot.
[36:46] Tell her not to come here if she has to say such words.
[36:51] Shh, don't say that. She is your younger sister.
[36:56] If she won't come here then where will she go? Tell me.
[36:58] Yes, she is my younger sister not the elder one. If I will say anything to her then you will feel bad.
[37:05] OK, I will make her understand. Everything will be fixed.
[37:11] You are my dear daughter who understands my words. Hmm?
[37:17] My daughter is very intelligent.
[37:33] Some documents were missing from the file which I took with me. That's why the deal got canceled.
[37:47] You must hide those documents. You wouldn't want Kabir to get that deal.
[37:53] Listen Aliya, the condition you are in at the moment. You need mental peace.
[37:58] Sometime some weird thoughts mentally disturb us due to some worries.
[38:04] He may get illusion. He sees something which actually doesn't exist.
[38:08] And you trap Kabir by getting him blackmailed emotionally. Let him free.
[38:14] Don't consider this as my warning.
[38:17] I know how to get my right.
[38:26] Me and Nawal are literally felt sorry to know about it because we thought that you are a very sensible woman.
[38:32] You won't exaggerate such minor domestic issues rather you will ignore those.
[38:42] I am such a big fool. Whatever she wants I am doing that.
[38:54] But not now, I am not weak.
