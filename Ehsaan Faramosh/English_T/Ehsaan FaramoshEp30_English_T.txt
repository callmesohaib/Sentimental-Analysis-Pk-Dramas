[01:20] Hello Sadaf.
Hello.
[01:22] Where are you?
[01:23] I'm home. Where will I be? You tell me, where are you? Whats up?
[01:28] What will I tell you? I'm just fine. Tell me, did your friend find the model?
[01:33] I don't have any idea.
[01:35] I didn't talk to her about it. Is everything alright? Why are you asking?
[01:40] I wanted to meet her. Is it possible?
Of course its possible.
[01:45] By the way, why do you want to meet her? Are you thinking of becoming a model?
[01:51] Not yet but who knows if I change my mind after meeting your friend.
[01:56] Get me a meeting with her.
[01:58] Why do I need to arrange a meeting? She's my friend and I can visit her office any time.
[02:04] You tell me, if you're free right now, I'll come now.
[02:07] Not right now. Lets plan for tomorrow. We'll meet tomorrow.
[02:10] Alright, fine. Done.
Bye.
[02:29] Sir, breakfast is ready.
No I'm not hungry. I'll leave.
[02:34] Hamza, whats the rush? Have breakfast before you leave.
[02:39] Mom, I'm getting late for an important meeting.
[02:43] Just pray that I get the contract. If that is so, your son's name will shine in the business community.
[02:49] As God wills, my prayers are always with you. Have something later.
[02:55] Yes I'll have lunch.
[02:56] Good luck.
Alright. Bye.
[03:23] Well, its good to see all members here.
[03:27] We received quotations from a number of companies.
[03:31] Some quotations were so impressive that it become difficult for us to decide.
[03:39] I want to take this opportunity to tell the CEO of Hamza Enterprises, Mr. Hamza that I'm impressed by your passion.
[03:47] And I must say you're an example for our youth. Really, I mean it.
[03:55] Thank you.
[03:57] Now let me announce the result. The quotations that we have received, amongst them,
[04:03] Hamza Group and Shirazi Group had quotations very close and our team has decided that we,
[04:11] will like to work with Shirazi Group.
[04:22] Thanks all of you.
[05:12] Congratulations. You have finally received the contract.
[05:15] Don't congratulate me. Congratulate Miss Nawal.
[05:19] It is because of her that we received this contract.
[05:24] Of course. Congratulations Miss Nawal.
[05:28] Its because of your intelligence and hard work that he has received such a big contract
[05:35] Thank you.
[06:11] Hello Falak. What a surprise! I'm happy to see you.
Thanks.
[06:16] Hi Anum. How are you?
I'm good. What about you?
[06:19] Perfect. So how do you like my office?
Very nice. Its good.
[06:24] Come, lets sit and talk. Sit down.
[06:30] So what did you think?
[06:32] By the way, seeing you here has given me an idea of your decision but still tell me.
[06:38] I want to test my luck once.
[06:41] Alright, now we're talking. So first of all we'll have a screen test with you. Ramsha.
[06:48] Ask the makeup artist to be ready.
Okay mam.
[06:52] Only lucky people get such a chance. One in a million. Fame and money, both together.
[07:01] Are you looking at these girls? All of them are here for work.
[07:05] But our Falak is very lucky in this regard. Isn't it Falak?
[07:09] That's true.
[07:12] Mam everything is ready.
[07:15] Lets go. We'll have coffee later. Lets work first.
Alright.
[07:28] Do I have to wear this dress?
[07:31] Yes this is the demand of the show. Is there a problem?
[07:36] This dress will boost your glamour. Try and wear it.
[07:40] The changing room is on the other side.
[08:01] Got a minute?
Yes please.
[08:07] What are you looking at?
[08:09] Survey report. The fire started because of a short circuit.
[08:15] We need to focus on this so that this never happens again.
[08:22] You're right. This incident has made us suffer a big loss.
[08:29] All competitors have gathered together and they're spreading rumors.
[08:35] I know. Just once. I need a big investor, just once. Everybody's mouth will be shut.
[08:44] Thats why I'm here.
[08:49] I talked to Mr. Omer Hayat's wife.
[08:53] I hope she will get us a face to face meeting.
[08:56] Once we talk face to face, all misunderstandings will be cleared.
I hope so.
[09:02] Wait a second. Hello Mrs. Hayat.
[09:10] I had complete faith that you'd get us the meeting. I understand. Thank you. Bye.
[09:20] Mr. Hayat said no to the meeting.
[09:26] Makes sense. This had to happen. Don't worry.
[09:32] I'm trying to arrange money from somewhere else. Don't worry.
[09:36] If only we found an investor who trusts us.
[09:43] We will find one. Hope for the best. Don't worry.
[09:49] Do you remember, we have an official lunch tomorrow from Mr. Sajjad?
Yes I remember.
[09:57] I was initially thinking about talking to him but he isn't interested in the food business at all.
[10:41] Wow. This dress suits you a lot. You look beautiful.
[10:47] Javy, I need a new look for her. Absolutely fresh.
Come, mam.
[11:40] We have achieved this after a long time. You have worked very hard for it.
[11:45] Sir, honestly I wasn't expecting all this. Thank you so much.
[11:50] Oh, we should be thankful to you.
No sir, this is my job.
[11:56] Sir, didn't I tell you. No matter what happens, we'll get this contract.
[12:01] Yes Hamza's face was a sight.
[12:05] I was so happy to look at his face. I was at peace.
[12:12] Like, I have fulfilled my wish after years.
[12:15] Keep a look out sir, we'll get all contracts in the future as well.
[12:21] As God wills.
[12:27] Mom? Mom? Mom?
What is it Nawal?
[12:33] Mom, I'm very happy today. Its because of you that I received a standing ovation today.
[12:39] The entire office was standing. All staff.
[12:41] Everybody clapped for me. I'm so happy, I cannot tell you.
[12:45] But tell me what it is all about?
[12:49] Mom, the contract I was working for, our company received that contract.
[12:53] All praise to God.
[12:54] Our company received such a big contract after a long time.
[12:58] Its all because of my daughter's hard work. May God bless you with more success.
[13:03] Do you know, my boss has promised me a promotion.
[13:07] As God wills. Everything will be good then.
[13:12] Its a very good idea. Put a few casual sarees in it so she can wear them casually.
Perfect.
[13:18] Oh Hamza.. Listen..
[13:23] What happened? Did you get the contract?
[13:29] You must have. Congratulations. I know it. If you want something,
[13:34] you get it all costs. Whatever he touches, turns to gold. Well done.
[13:41] Were you saying something?
[13:42] I brought some dresses for Nawal. You'll like them.
[13:46] And you also have to tell me if she'll like them or not.
[13:49] Its best if you ask Nawal about them. I cannot say anything.
[13:57] Excuse me.
Mom.. what happened to him?
[14:03] He must be tired. You also ask him so many questions. Lets finish this.
[14:09] You never know his moods.
[14:23] Wow. Beautiful. I wanted this look. This girl will set everything on fire. What do you say?
[14:31] So should we ask her to sign one contract?
Whatever you say.
[14:36] Send me all the pictures.
[14:45] Maria? Hello?
Hie Falak. I'm sending you all the pictures.
[14:53] The look is amazing. Wow.
Okay.
[15:08] Falak? Falak, lets go. We're getting late.
[15:13] Actually I was saying, we could go tomorrow. I feel very tired.
Not at all.
[15:18] Aaliya has strictly instructed that I should take you out, take you shopping and take you dinner.
[15:26] She was scolding me that I don't care of you and that you get bored at home.
[15:31] That's why I'll take you out.
[15:35] Lets go. Leave it. Check it later.
Yes. Give me my phone.
[15:43] Take your bag. Lets go.
Give me my phone.
[15:46] You'll get your phone.
[15:54] The quotations that we have received, had Hamza Group's and Shirazi Group's quotations very close.
[16:00] But our team has decided to work with Shirazi Group.
[16:08] Don't congratulate me, congratulate Miss Nawal. Its her hard work that has gotten us the contract.
[17:09] Congratulations Miss Nawal. Your dedication and hard work have won them a very big contract.
[17:24] Starters or sea food?
[17:31] Do you like it here?
Yes. I really like it.
[17:37] But whats the use? You'll not bring me out every other day.
[17:41] Even if I like it, I'll have to go back to the same house, same room. Same boredom.
[17:48] Why can't I bring you here? Whats the big deal about it? We'll come whenever you say.
[17:55] No. Had Aaliya not reminded you, you wouldn't have brought me here.
You're right.
[18:04] Actually, whatever happened in the past few days, I've been very occupied with everything.
[18:11] Falak, why don't you do something? Find yourself a good activity. You'll be busy and not get bored.
[18:21] Think about it. Don't say no then.
Why would I say no then?
[18:26] You can do whatever you want to do. Keep yourself busy but,
[18:34] But what?
Just make sure, our child to come isn't harmed.
[18:40] Even I know that much. I'm not that stupid.
[18:44] Now we're talking. Tell me what do you want to eat.
[19:20] Do whatever you want to do. Keep yourself busy Falak. Find a good activity for yourself.
[19:51] Welcome. Welcome.
Hello. This is for you.
[19:55] Thank you so much. So nice of you.
[19:59] I thought you people might not come.
You invited, why wouldn't we come?
[20:04] Obviously we had to come.
I'm so honored. Oh, excuse me.
[20:12] Hello. Welcome. Welcome. How are you? Thank you. So nice of you.
[20:22] You're very lucky that you're working with Mr. Hamdani. A lot of big companies wanted to work with him.
[20:29] But all praise to the Lord, you won the deal. Anyways, meet them. This is Mrs. Aaliya.
[20:34] Hello.
And this is Mr. Kabeer. Owner of Kabeer Foods and business partner.
[20:41] Nice meeting you.
Same here. Who doesn't know them?
[20:45] How are you Mr. Shirazi?
I'm absolutely fine. How are you?
[20:49] I'm absolutely fine. Thank God.
Excuse me.
[20:54] I'm so sorry, I have to take this.
No problem.
[21:01] Heard about the fire in the branch. It was very upsetting.
[21:05] Yes, thank God, it wasn't a big incident and there were no causalities.
[21:10] We get to hear a lot of things.
[21:12] You suffered a loss worth millions and Omer Hayat canceled his business deal as well.
[21:17] You know this happens in business.
Of course. This is how business works.
[21:24] Some time ago, I thought about investing in the food business but then I canceled it.
[21:29] We don't get time from the construction and real estate business.
[21:33] There would be no one to look after our food business.
[21:35] So, why don't you look into a partnership in food business. You could invest.
[21:41] The other party could handle everything. It isn't that difficult.
[21:45] Miss Aaliya, you cannot trust anyone in this age.
[21:50] Thats true. Anyway, we'll keep talking but I want you to meet a few guests.
[21:57] Miss Aaliya, please help yourself. Have something.
[23:11] Alright. You go. I'll call you if I want to discuss anything.
[23:18] Hello?
Where are you right now?
[23:21] In the office. Where else would I be?
I want to talk to you.
[23:27] Yes, tell me.
No. Face to face.
[23:31] No. I'm very busy. I cannot come. Tell me on call.
No matter how busy you are,
[23:36] you can take some time out. I'm waiting where we always meet.
[24:11] I told you I was very busy. I had back to back meetings. I came only because of you.
[24:20] What do you want to show me? Are you the only one busy?
[24:24] Don't I have any work in the office?
[24:27] I didn't mean that.
[24:29] Whatever you meant. Would I need to get an appointment to see you, ever since you got the contract?
[24:37] See, I wanted to talk to you about it. This happens in the business.
[24:43] I know how important this contract was for you.
It was important.
[24:47] That he got because of you.
[24:51] Why didn't you tell me that you worked for Shirazi?
[24:54] I told you I worked for a multinational company with a good package.
[24:59] And as it is, I had to join any company after leaving your company and Shirazi..
[25:04] Had you mentioned Shirazi I wouldn't have let you join. Ever.
[25:08] He's my competitor. He never lets go of any chance to hurt me.
[25:16] You should have asked me before joining him.
See, you're wrong.
[25:22] You're mistaken.
[25:24] I haven't seen or heard anything about you from Mr. Shirazi or anybody else. How can you say that?
[25:33] I could never think you would be this stupid.
[25:39] You're resigning today.
What?
[25:44] What did you say?
We're getting married in a month.
[25:48] You had to resign then. Do it now. What difference does it make?
[25:53] As it is, I'll not allow you to work once we're married but if you want to work, you can join my office.
[26:00] This is my career and I worked hard for it. You cannot force me to resign.
[26:09] I worked hard for this and I will not let it go waste because of a misunderstanding.
[26:17] You will spoil our relationship because of a third person.
[26:21] You'll have to think about it.
Are you jealous of my success?
[26:26] You don't like it because you didn't get that contract.
[26:33] Are you mad? Will I be jealous of you?
[26:38] How could you even think like that Nawal?
You think that only you were entitled to that contract Hamza.
[26:43] Its not like that. Anybody could get that.
[26:47] See my business is spread around the world and you're only working an ordinary job..
[26:52] Then why are you forcing a girl with an ordinary job to resign.
[26:58] You don't understand, Nawal. He is using you against me. Why don't you understand?
This isn't so.
[27:04] I think you're mistaken and nothing else.
See,
[27:12] you will resign from that office today. That's it. This is my final decision.
[27:20] I'm sorry Hamza. I will not resign.
[28:32] You came back early from the office. Is everything alright?
I felt a little down.
[28:40] Is everything alright? Anything to worry about?
[28:45] Alright, the wedding cards are here. Come with me, I'll show you.
[28:49] You look at them. I'm going to my room. I'm tired.
[28:54] Don't disturb me please.
[29:15] Hamza, its good that you're here. I have to go see Nawal. You come with me.
[29:22] I have a headache. Please go with the driver.
[29:31] Nazish what happened?
Mom whether you accept it or not.
[29:35] I think Hamza and Nawal have had an argument.
[29:39] I have never seen him this rude, ever.
You should call Nawal and ask.
[29:44] Yes.
I don't understand this boy. He's always so moody.
[29:58] What happened?
Mom, her phone is off.
[30:01] Alright. Forget it. Just leave it.
[30:08] Hello.
Hello.
[30:11] Did you call me?
Yes.
[30:16] Yes Sultana called. She was worried for the wedding preparations,
[30:23] She was asking if we could send Falak for a few days.
[30:26] She was also calling me but I didn't answer because I was busy.
[30:30] Alright. Its her sister's wedding, send her there for a few days. Whats the problem?
[30:35] I have no issues with Falak going there.
[30:38] I'm just scared that she'll be careless there. You know what the doctor said.
[30:45] I remember very well but you're forgetting that Sultana is Falak's mother and she'll take care of her well.
Exactly.
[30:56] Alright. I'll ask Falak to go in the day.
[31:00] Yes. That's fine. If you think its good.
[31:06] Kabeer, I was thinking one thing. I want to share it with you. I might go meet Mr. Shirazi in a day or two.
[31:17] Mr. Shirazi? Is everything alright?
[31:21] He's interested to invest in food business.
[31:26] We need a big investment, maybe he can invest.
Alright as you find best.
[31:34] Best of luck guys.
[31:53] Hello sir.
Hello. Come sit.
[32:02] How are you Ms. Nawal?
I'm fine sir.
[32:05] Here.
Sir what is this?
[32:09] Please take a look.
[32:28] Sir, is this..
[32:30] Yes this is your promotion letter. We promised you'd get a promotion if we got Mr. Hamdani's contract. Congratulations.
[32:43] Thank you. Thank you so much sir.
[32:46] You're our senior manager now. You'll lead the entire department from today.
[32:55] Sir, thank you so much. This means a lot to me.
[32:58] Mr. Waqar please tell everyone to follow Ms. Nawal's orders from now on. Thank you.
[33:08] I'm very happy to have such a hard working and dedicated girl as a part of our organization.
Sir,
[33:16] This means a lot to me. Thank you so much.
You deserve it.
[34:23] Give me your purse. Give it to me..
Stop..
[34:36] Falak.. Falak, what happened?
Kabeer those boys took my bag. They went that way. Please see.
[34:43] Are you okay? Did something happen to you?
They had a pistol. They said they'd shoot me.
[34:49] Please I have everything in my bag, call the police.
[34:51] That I will but what are you doing here right now?
[34:55] I was here to meet my friend. Call the police, will you?
I will. Come now. Leave them.
[35:02] Nawal what is it, what is bothering you, tell me.
[35:06] You come home from work and shut yourself in your room. I don't understand how we'll manage everything.
[35:12] Only a few days are left for the wedding and have we so many things to do. How many things should I do?
[35:24] There's nothing to worry about.
Tell me how it will be done?
[35:29] I'm all alone. How will I manage? I called Falak's in laws but even she didn't come.
[35:47] I got a promotion.
[35:51] What? All praise to the Lord. You're giving me such a big news like this.
[36:00] May God give you a lot of success. May you always be happy and stay away from all evil eyes.
[36:09] Mam, Mr. Hamza is here.
[36:12] Alright. Make him sit. Nawal, give company to Hamza. I'll just come.
[36:24] Think about it. Had they shot you, what would have happen.
[36:29] Kabeer? Falak? Are you okay?
[36:36] Why did you have to go all alone?
[36:38] That's what I'm saying why did she go all alone?
[36:43] I asked her to take the driver. Why did you go alone?
[36:48] The driver wasn't available and I wanted to meet my friend so I went all alone.
[36:52] Which friend of yours stay there? I don't think you have a friend there.
[36:57] there is one, Kabir
[36:58] Whats wrong with you? She's already worried and you're asking so many questions.
[37:03] Thank God she's home. See,
[37:06] You must be in a lot of trauma. I'm sure you must be shaken. You go to your room and rest.
[37:36] How are you?
[37:41] I'm fine. How are you?
[37:45] I'm fine. Come inside.
[37:47] No. I want to discuss something important. Its best if we do it here.
[37:53] I don't want our families to be involved.
[37:57] Speak. I'm listening.
[38:02] What did you think?
About what.
[38:06] About your resignation. What else?
[38:11] Hamza I was promoted. I'm the Senior Manager. 
[38:15] Sherazi gave me the letter and my package has been doubled.
[38:20] And still you don't understand. Which company promotes so easily? 
[38:26] I've been here for a little while but you've been working here since ages.
[38:30] What do you want to say?
I'm telling you they're trapping you.
[38:35] Come on Hamza, I'm not a kid who doesn't understand.
[38:42] We're getting married in three weeks. Everybody knows that.
[38:47] People laugh at me. Everybody knows my wife to be works for someone else. 
[38:54] Do you know how awkward I feel when people say such things?
[38:58] Your marriage, your life, your office, your career, your respect, where am I in all this? 
[39:04] Everything is yours. Where am I in all this?
[39:07] My life, my career, my choice, my respect. Do they have any value in your respect?
[39:15] I thought you had changed but I was wrong. 
[39:18] You only know how to exercise your will on others.
[39:24]  And as far as my resignation is concerned, I'll not give any.
