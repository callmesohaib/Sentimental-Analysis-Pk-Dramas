[00:12] Elders of the family know and understand rituals very well.
[00:18] If you think the bracelets are very heavy, then don't wear them.
[00:22] Wear them only when we are visiting someone in our extended family.
[00:25] Don't be stubborn. It doesn't look well you standing here, roadside.
[00:29] Hamza, I told you to leave. I don't want you worrying about me.
[00:34] Tell me one thing, is Nawal your actual sister?
[00:41] Yes, why are you saying that?
[00:44] Listening to you it seems she's your step-sister.
[00:48] Why were you waiting here?
[00:50] And why would I visit you in your home?
[00:53] Come and see the palace which I live in.
[00:58] The person you taunted your entire life...
[01:04] see how she lives now in her own home.
[01:17] If God has granted you more than your worth, then you should thank God, and not be arrogant.
[01:25] It doesn't take long for one to lose everything.
[01:28] Really? How would I lose everything?
[01:33] If I tell your in-laws...
[01:37] then you aren't Sultana's daughter...
[01:44] then all of that arrogance will be gone.
[01:48] My grateful that I am not visiting you in your home.
[01:51] Don't you dare talk to me in that tone ever again?
[02:44] Sir, have some sweetmeats as well.
What's the occasion?
[02:47] Ma'am Nawal is getting married.
[02:55] Sir, you have a meeting with Nijad builders, and after that, you have a meeting with...
[03:00] Simran manufacturing... after that...
Cancel all the meetings
[03:04] Pardon?
I said, cancel all the meetings.
[03:08] Okay, sir...
Ask Miss Nawal to come to my room.
[03:23] What happened?
[03:26] Nothing...
Then why are you so angry?
[03:30] Why do the guests always tell me off?
[03:34] Did she do something to you?
You can ask her that.
[03:39] Alright, go and rest in your room. I'll talk to her.
[03:43] Mother, what problem does she have with me?
[03:47] She always taunts me that I'm not your daughter.
[03:51] Why does she do this to me? Either she will stop coming here, or I will.
Why?
[03:59] I'll talk to her.
[04:07] Sister... I've told you so many times that Falak is my daughter.
[04:12] Why do you talk to her like a stranger? Why do you hurt her?
[04:18] You should teach your daughters how to talk to elders.
[04:23] Sister, she's young. Elders need to maintain respect,
[04:26] if they don't then how do they expect others to be respectful?
[04:32] You're saying that to me?
Yes, I am.
[04:35] I'm telling you this. Falak and Nawal are my daughters.
[04:40] And both of them are equal to me.
[04:45] You don't know Falak well. She has a dual personality.
[04:50] She's different with you and different with me.
She's my daughter.
[04:56] I raised her, she does not have a dual personality.
[04:59] I'm not pointing fingers at how you raised her.
[05:04] But blood matters too...
[05:06] I come here only because of Nawal, otherwise, I don't like coming here.
[05:12] You're being blinded by her and when you see her true face you'll regret it.
[05:19] Remember that.
[05:48] You called me?
Sit down.
[05:54] I'm listening...
Why did you get engaged?
[06:03] Do you not care about my feelings?
[06:07] Ever since I've come here I've asked for your forgiveness. I know I shouldn't have left you.
[06:14] Is there no margin for error?
[06:20] Nawal, I'm talking to you, answer me!
I don't want to talk to you right now.
[06:24] I'm not your boss right now.
[06:27] You were the one who said that no matter how bad relationships get...
[06:31] they can always be mended if someone puts their heart into it.
[06:33] It was never my heart...
[06:36] What you broke was my trust.
[06:41] We always look at false realities.
[06:42] We think that if we leave someone we'll find the waiting for us at the same place, but that doesn't happen.
[06:50] This is life and someone always comes by to fill the void.
[06:56] It doesn't make anyone any difference if someone leaves, yes, it does hurt for a while...
[07:02] then everything gets better, as it did with me.
[07:05] You cannot do this. You cannot fill this void with anyone else.
[07:10] Why not? I can... I have the full right to think about myself and decide for myself.
[07:18] If only I could turn back time.
[07:21] If only I could make things between us like it was before.
[07:23] That's not possible. This is not something that either of us can cover.
[07:29] We gave five years to this!
[07:33] Neither you nor I can make up for it.
[07:42] It would be better if we both head our separate ways.
[08:53] I'm asking her to stay for a few days.
[08:56] If she's insisting, stay for a few days. If you want to,
[09:01] Stay... Kabir is allowing you as well.
[09:08] I can't stay right now, we have to pack for the tour at home as well.
[09:13] Alright fine... Kabir, does she bother you?
[09:19] Yes... she does bother me. She doesn't listen to me at all.
[09:25] Falak, what am I hearing?
[09:29] Mother, he's lying. I don't bother him, he bothers me. Like he's doing right now.
[09:38] I'm joking, she doesn't bother me at all.
[09:41] In fact, she listens to everything I say. Everyone praises her at home.
[09:47] They say that she's innocent and precious like a child.
[09:53] May God bless you with happiness and prosperity.
[10:00] Amen.
[10:03] Shall we leave, or do you have any other complaints?
[10:05] Auntie, have I complained to you about her?
[10:10] Not at all... Kabir has never complained...
[10:15] See...
I'm the one who made the mistake...
[10:20] Shall we leave now? We're getting late mother.
[10:24] Alright... keep smiling.
Okay...
[10:30] Farewell*
[10:54] Hello...
[10:56] Yes, sister, we've gotten a few reviews and we need to improve our services.
[11:05] Yes... I too want to respect the rights of the critics.
[11:12] Don't worry... this time our clients will get new benefits.
[11:16] I have a lot of new ideas that will entertain the customer.
[11:21] As you say, sister... you're the best.
[11:26] Okay, bye.
[11:34] I thought that you might have missed me.
[11:37] Of course, I did, any doubts?
[11:42] You always talk about work with sister Aliyah, don't you get bored talking about work all day?
[11:50] You know what, I enjoyed you saying that.
[11:54] Do you know why? Because we don't have time to get bored.
[11:58] Yes... and you don't even have time for me.
[12:05] What's with you? What are you saying? You know you are special to me.
[12:13] You're my life.
[12:17] Alright... don't ruin your mood.
[12:21] Let's plan something.
[12:23] Let's go on a long drive, listen to your favorite music...
[12:27] and then we'll have your favorite dinner.
[12:33] Okay... let's go
[12:36] Okay... let's put on some music.
[12:39] The volume...
[12:55] Happy?
Yeah.
[12:59] Kabir...
[13:01] Kabir, your phone was out of reach, I called you so many times.
[13:05] The Dubai delegation is here, who's going with us? The due date is near and we've done nothing.
[13:10] Sister, I'm sorry, my phone was off and I did turn it off.
[13:15] Actually, Falak and I were out for dinner. I was getting a lot of calls...
[13:22] Falak wanted us to spend time.
I understand that.
[13:26] I know that this was your family time... but...
[13:31] Falak, we need to sacrifice a few things for success.
[13:36] Slowly you'll get used to Kabir's schedule.
[13:42] Sister... she can't manage everything like you. You're a genius, perfect in everything.
[13:50] Why did you say that? She's smart and she'll learn to manage.
[13:56] In the situation that we have nowadays, we need to be in communication.
[14:00] You will attend every one of my calls from now on.
[14:02] Especially for big clients like Hamza, we need to be extra professional.
[14:06] Yes, boss.
Now, go and rest.
[14:09] Falak, you're responsible to send him for the meeting tomorrow morning.
[14:14] Sure...
[14:17] Goodnight*
[14:35] You don't know Falak, she has a dual personality.
[14:40] She's different with you and different with us.
[14:43] Mother...
[14:47] why are you worried?
[14:52] Sister Fariya came by to congratulate... and...
[14:58] she was taunting Falak, and when I tried to make her understand, she left upset.
[15:04] Mother you know auntie doesn't like Falak.
[15:08] You should have listened to her and made Falak understand.
[15:12] It's not like she comes here every day.
[15:15] You're right... I should have done that.
[15:19] But I got angry when I saw tears in Falak's eyes.
[15:23] And now I feel guilty. I only have one sister-in-law...
[15:27] It's alright, she'll cool down in a few days, we'll visit her and cheer her up.
[15:32] Her anger like yours is only for a short time. Don't worry.
[15:37] You get worried over such trivial stuff.
Greetings.
[15:43] Greetings*
Auntie...
[15:47] How are you?
I'm well... and how are you?
[15:51] I'm well.
Come sit.
[15:53] I was coming home from work and wanted to see how you were doing.
[15:58] It's good you came by.
[16:02] Nawal... arrange for some food.
No auntie, no need for formalities.
[16:09] Actually, I wanted to take Nawal out for dinner.
[16:18] If you think that's fine and Nawal doesn't mind...
[16:25] I don't think this is appropriate.
[16:28] You'll be married in a few days and after that, you'll have a lot of time to go out with each other.
[16:34] You're right, our relationship is new and I wanted to know each other.
[16:42] Don't worry, I'll drop Nawal early.
[16:50] I'll have tea made.
[17:00] Mother, please refuse...
[17:05] I know... I don't like this as well, but he didn't call before coming.
[17:11] He came here directly. If he would have called I would have refused.
[17:18] It's not appropriate for me to go like this.
[17:22] You know I don't like this as well.
[17:25] I understand.
[17:29] Nawal, you were the one who convinced me to get Falak married first.
[17:35] Everything that happened to Falak was up to her standards and desires.
[17:42] For me the two of you are equal.
[17:45] I don't want there to be an unjust balance between you two.
[17:52] That's why I want you to know Asjad well and then make your decision.
[18:00] So that I may be at ease.
[18:06] I don't want to regret that you made this decision for me.
[18:12] It won't be appropriate for us to refuse.
[18:16] I think you should go with him, just hurry back.
[18:21] Go and change...
[18:27] Alright.
[18:44] May I ask you something?
Sure...
[18:49] Are you always this serious, or only when you're with me?
[18:57] I'm like this...
Do you know that this seriousness suits you?
[19:16] Why are you stopping the car?
Wait a second.
[19:54] This is for you.
[19:57] Thank you.
You're welcome.
[20:10] Don't you like flowers?
[20:14] No, they are lovely and I do like them.
[20:19] How can someone hate flowers?
You're right about that.
[20:29] Poor choice Kabir, you deserve a better life partner.
[20:33] Because of me, you endured a great loss.
It's okay.
[20:38] Forget what happened.
[21:39] Sir, I regret to inform you that you have no balance on your card.
[21:46] What, this cannot be? Try again.
[21:51] I've checked twice, there's no balance.
[21:58] That's not possible, you have it wrong.
[22:02] Sir, I've checked it twice and the balance is zero.
[22:06] Why don't you pay in cash? You can pay in cash.
[22:14] I don't have enough cast, I'll come with you. Let's check the problem.
[22:18] Don't worry, I'll pay for it.
[22:23] No Nawal... why would you pay... I'll take a look.
It's alright.
[22:28] It's the same.
[22:34] I'll return this money to you. It shouldn't be like this.
[22:37] I think my remaining cards were left back at the office.
[22:42] I'll take a look at it tomorrow.
[22:47] Thank you*
[23:09] Falak we have our official dinner with our investors and...
[23:14] our office staff will be there as well.
[23:18] I want you to be active in the party.
[23:22] I want people to see my luck and the women to be jealous of you.
[23:26] Kabir, she's meeting our office staff and our investors for the first time, please don't confuse her.
[23:34] Kabir... the dinner is tonight and you're telling me now.
[23:38] I'm so sorry, it got finalized last night and I forgot to tell you.
[23:48] I need to go to the salon...
[23:51] I won't get any appointments on such short notice. How will I manage everything and get ready?
[23:57] You'll get it, don't worry. I'll call them.
[24:00] Listen... get ready how you want to get ready.
[24:08] See... your problem is solved. Sister has the solution for everything.
[24:22] Kabir...
[24:23] Did you talk to Mr. Umar Hayat?
Yes, he'll be arriving with his wife.
[24:29] Good.
[24:32] Who's Umar Hayat?
[24:34] He's a big businessman and the owner of a food chain.
[24:38] He has food branches spread across the entire world.
[24:41] We already have Hamza with us, but to do business in South Asia and other countries we need help from Umar Hayat.
[24:52] Sister, I was thinking Umar Hayat will be with his wife.
[24:56] His mood will be good and the environment will be perfect as well...
[24:59] I think I should talk to him about the business deal. I expect the deal to get finalized
[25:04] I think that's a good idea. You call Hamza, right?
Yes, I did.
[25:10] The dinner is celebrating your marriage, but I'm sure all the discussions there will be business related.
[25:24] Should I give you two some free advice?
[25:27] Both of you should try leaving business out the door every once in a while.
[25:30] It would seem nice if we sat together and enjoy each other's company every once in a while.
[25:35] Alright... I'll listen to my brother. From now on this rule is final.
[25:40] No business talk during family time.
[25:46] Hello Mr. Jamal. Tomorrow's appointment is done.
[25:52] Yes, I'll arrange to have you two meet...
[26:01] Brother, I have an innocent question.
[26:06] The rule you just stated would that be implemented after that phone or are you expecting a few more calls like that?
[26:14] Tell us what the time line is.
[26:19] We forgive you.
[27:26] Hamza hasn't arrived yet, did you talk to him?
[27:29] Yes, I did, he said he was busy and that he won't be able to make it.
[27:33] It's okay.
[27:40] Congratulations!
Thank you, sir.
[27:42] So good to see, I'm so glad that you came.
[27:44] Same here, many congratulations to you two.
[27:47] Thank you
You look wonderful.
[27:50] Thank you so much.
Come this way.
[28:25] Serve her first.
Thank you.
[28:30] I have to hand it to you, you've turned Kabir into a businessman.
[28:35] When Umar and I met a few years ago he didn't say much.
[28:39] He didn't have business knowledge as well.
[28:42] But today I was surprised to hear him talk.
[28:47] No, to be honest, I didn't make him.
[28:50] The truth is that Kabir is very intelligent.
[28:53] Whatever it may be, you are Kabir's backbone and I know that well.
[28:59] This is Falak, Kabir's wife.
[29:02] Hi*
Falak give her company, I'll be back.
[29:08] Excuse me, please.
[29:15] Falak, when are you joining the company?
[29:20] What do you mean?
I mean the food chain and the hotels...
[29:24] I heard that Kabir wants to spread his business outside of Pakistan.
[29:28] I think you should support Kabir like Aliyah.
[29:32] She's so smart and intelligent.
[29:35] But I have no interest in Kabir's business.
[29:40] What?
[29:44] I don't know whether this party was organized to celebrate our wedding or maintain Kabir's business.
[29:49] No one has talked about anything else apart from their business.
[29:53] What do you mean?
[29:58] Meaning, if you want to talk about business, then I'm not interested.
[30:02] Why don't you join them? They're talking about business over there.
[30:07] I thought that Aliyah would find a smart girl like herself for Kabir...
[30:15] But you...
[30:18] anyways... thank you...
[30:32] I hope that we will grow when we work with you.
[30:37] Kabir, your wife is very rude.
[30:41] Her behavior is so unpleasant.
[30:46] I'm so sorry if you didn't like something she said.
[30:51] Poor choice Kabir, you deserve a better life partner.
[31:01] Noshaba let it go, it's alright.
[31:04] Kabir, don't mind, please.
It's okay sir.
[31:08] I'll make her understand.
[31:11] She's naive and a little childish.
[31:18] Anyways... let's talk about work.
[31:21] Next week let's fix a meeting. We'll discuss the details there.
[31:27] Yes of course. I won't be available next week.
[31:32] Sister Aliayah will be there.
[31:35] Kabir, you're lucky to have Aliyah with you.
[31:40] Umar and I were thinking of doing a joint venture with you.
[31:44] We'll enjoy working with you.
My pleasure.
[32:40] What rubbish, she did this to me on purpose!
[32:44] I'm really sorry, I felt dizzy and I slipped. I'm really sorry.
[32:49] Don't lie!
[32:52] Umar... this girl is a liar!
[33:01] Kabir, why would I lie? Why would I do this on purpose? I'm sorry.
[33:09] Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
[33:13] Falak didn't do this on purpose.
[33:15] Noshaba, calm down.
[33:21] Kabir, please don't mind.
[33:24] Let's go, Umar... I don't want to stay here for a moment.
You can't leave upset... please!
[33:30] We're really sorry, please don't leave upset.
[33:37] Please allow us and look after your guests.
[33:42] I'm really sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.
[33:46] I didn't intend to.
Don't do this.
[33:49] Kabir, if you want to work with us, don't bring your wife to the next meeting.
[33:54] She's a shallow girl.
[33:57] Umar, let's go. I won't stay here for a moment.
[34:00] Kabir... we'll leave.
[34:03] Let's go.
[34:15] Falak... bring a chair!
What happened to her?
[34:45] How are you feeling now?
[34:49] My head feels heavy. I feel dizzy.
[34:53] I think you took stress from what she said.
[34:59] I'm very sensitive.
[35:02] If someone would get upset at me when I was a child I would get depressed.
[35:07] Now because of me, the entire day was ruined.
[35:12] We endured a loss.
It's alright, we can't change what happened.
[35:20] There is no point in getting depressed.
[35:23] Be strong... I'll send juice for you. You'll feel better.
[35:27] Okay...
[35:42] I taught her a lesson. She'll remember it her entire life.
[35:46] Thank God that you gave me such a clever mind.
[35:51] It was a good excuse to tell them I was feeling dizzy, otherwise, I would be open to criticism.
[36:09] Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[36:20] I couldn't even think that such a big mess would be created...
[36:24] that too with a client like Umar Hayat.
[36:29] I'm so sorry to disappoint you.
[36:34] It's alright, we stay ready for unexpected things in business...
[36:42] So... don't worry...
[36:45] Just take care of Falak...
[36:49] I'll apologize to Miss Hayat, don't you worry about that. I'll handle it.
[36:54] I know I'm sure you'll handle it well. But still, this shouldn't have happened.
[37:02] All we can do is try,
[37:04] I was thinking...
[37:07] that this time I should arrange the dinner at our restaurant, with full protocol.
[37:13] You're right... it's a good idea.
[37:18] I think that would be better... Look after Falak, I'll send juice for her.
[37:49] Are you alright?
Kabir...
[37:52] I'm sorry, you had to endure such a big loss because of me.
[37:56] It's okay... forget what happened.
[38:01] For me, you're the most important thing.
[38:08] I just want you to get better. Sister Aliyah has handled things.
[38:12] Are you upset with me?
No.
[38:16] I'm not upset at all... I didn't know that you were so sensitive.
[38:21] Otherwise, I would never have scolded you.
[38:27] Maybe you are stressed out because of that as well.
[38:30] I was very worried.
No need to worry.
[38:37] I will take care of you like you want me to take care of you.
[38:48] I'll go and change.
