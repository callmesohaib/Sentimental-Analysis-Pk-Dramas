[01:11] Then?
[01:16] Yes finalize the meetings. I've seen the schedule. Alright.
[01:21] Okay. Done.
[01:23] Are you going somewhere, Hamza?
[01:25] Yes I have an official tour of Europe.
I have a meeting with a few companies.
[01:32] Alright then, I'll come with you.
[01:35] But what will you do there?
[01:38] So what will I do here?
[01:40] You know how your mother and sister treat me.
[01:43] If you aren't here, they'll taunt me even more.
[01:45] As it is, they don't like me living here. Its better I come with you.
[01:52] But I'll be busy in the meetings there.
[01:56] You'll not be busy the entire day. Meetings don't take all day.
[01:59] When we get time, we'll go out, do shopping and spend time with one another.
[02:04] As it is, we didn't even go for our honeymoon.
[02:08] We have this excuse. Lets go. Whats the harm?
[02:12] See Falak, I'm not going alone.
[02:14] I'll have my whole team and sometimes the meetings take whole day.
[02:19] Once I'm free from there, we'll plan our honeymoon.
[02:23] Do you know how much I want to? I want to go out,
[02:26] I'm tired of being at home. I get bored at home.
[02:29] So go out. Whose stopping you? Hang out with your friends. In fact I'll do one thing.
[02:34] I'll get you a club membership. You'll get a good gathering. Enjoy there
[02:38] I don't want a club membership Hamza. I want to go with you.
[02:41] Please take me along.
[02:43] Falak, try and understand if I say something. Don't be stubborn without a reason.
[02:49] Yes. Whatever I say is rejected. I don't have any value in your life.
[03:02] You finalize the deal with Mr. Yasir and tell me. I think he's a good man.
[03:09] Yes. Everything is okay from my side. Have you checked to your satisfaction?
[03:14] I have no objections then. See you in the office, tomorrow. Okay.
[03:25] Sister Aaliya..
[03:28] How come you're here all of a sudden?
[03:31] You tell me, how are you?
[03:33] I'm fine but you came all of a sudden. You didn't even tell me.
[03:37] You should have informed me, I would have come pick you at the airport.
[03:39] How would this have been a surprise then?
I told Toqueer to not tell you anything.
[03:45] But what a pleasant surprise! I'm so happy. I don't believe it.
[03:51] Had I told you, how would I see this happiness on your face.
[03:55] Hello mam.
[03:58] Hello. How are you?
[04:00] I'm fine. How are you? How is sir?
[04:03] I'm very well and they're both good too.
[04:07] Alright, now take this bag to sister Aaliya's room and get her room cleaned fast.
[04:10] Alright.
[04:15] Where is Ilham?
[04:18] She just slept a little while ago. She isn't well.
[04:24] Why? What happened to her?
[04:26] She has fever.
[04:28] Did you get her checked from a doctor?
[04:31] Yes, I did. The doctor said she'd be fine.
[04:34] Her nanny.. Where is Noor?
[04:39] Noor has resigned.
[04:42] Her husband found a government job in Hyderabad so she shifted with him.
[04:47] Should I go see her?
[04:59] Why do you have to be upset about it? Its just for a week.
[05:03] And how will I spend this whole week?
[05:07] I've been telling you since long.
[05:09] You know how difficult it is to live with auntie and your sister. They taunt me.
[05:15] I'm scared Hamza.
[05:17] What if I answer them back? What will happen then? Please try and understand.
[05:26] Alright. Give me your passport.
[05:32] Thank you Hamza.
[05:37] Now fix your mood.
[05:45] All praise to God, she's so happy because you're here. It seems she wasn't even sick.
[05:52] She had high fever.
[05:55] I'm here but I'm not here forever.
[06:00] If I'm not around who'll take care of her?
[06:04] I talked. We'll arrange a nanny in a day or two. Don't worry.
[06:09] And if she leaves as well?
[06:12] What about that?
[06:14] Why will she leave?
[06:18] What are you saying?
[06:20] Why would a girl take up a permanent job here?
[06:26] They will leave someday or the other. Sometimes people are helpless.
[06:35] That's why I kept telling you.
[06:40] Let me take Ilham with me. I'll take care of her, well.
[06:46] Toqueer told me to get her passport. He said he'd talk to you.
[06:52] She'll stay with us happily, there..
sister Aaliya..
[06:59] We have already discussed this topic.
[07:01] You know very well I won't send Ilham with you. Think about it yourself.
[07:07] If Ilham goes with you, what will I do here, all alone?
[07:11] How can I leave her alone?
[07:14] God forbid if you have to travel out of city, then?
[07:17] What will you do then?
[07:18] I'll manage. I'm managing right now as well.
[07:26] There's another solution
[07:29] And what is that?
[07:32] Kabeer you should get married again.
[07:39] What are you saying? I mean, how could you even think about it?
[07:45] I will not get married again. Not at all.
[07:48] Why? Whats the harm?
[07:52] If not today then tomorrow, you'll have to get married. Then why not now?
[07:57] It will be good for Ilham. Whoever becomes your wife, will also take care of Ilham?
[08:02] What guarantee do you have that the girl who comes here,
[08:05] she will take care of Ilham when Ilham's own mother didn't care for her.
[08:13] And I've heard a lot of stories about step mothers.
I'll not take any such risk, please.
[08:21] So will you stay here like this always? Alone?
[08:27] Kabeer look at yourself. You and this house,
[08:33] need someone who can give you company and take care of you.
[08:38] Aaliya, no matter what happens, I'll not get married again and this is my final decision.
[08:51] Grandma, will you take me to funland?
[08:55] Of course I will.
[08:57] I want ice cream as well. Please grandma. Mom doesn't let me eat ice cream.
[09:02] Bad mom.. but you know she's right. You eat ice cream and get a sore throat.
[09:08] Come on, lets go. We're late. Come.
Hello.
[09:13] Hello.
Are you people going somewhere?
[09:15] Yes I'm taking Nazish and Naveen for dinner. Come with us.
[09:20] No. Actually Falak and I just had dinner.
[09:24] Alright.
[09:25] I wanted to discuss something with you. I'm busy throughout the day, I don't get time.
[09:30] Tell me what it is.
[09:33] Falak and I are going to Europe for a week on our honeymoon.
[09:40] Are you asking me or telling me?
[09:48] I'm telling you. Actually its a business trip so I thought I'd take her.
[09:53] She'll have an outing and we'll have our honeymoon as well.
[09:55] Dear, we're getting late. If not ice cream, we can have chocolates. Come on. Lets go.
[10:04] Hamza, mom wouldn't have told you no
[10:09] but it would have been good had you asked her before you planned.
[10:15] She would be proud.
[10:41] sister Aaliya, is Ilham asleep?
[10:45] I couldn't even make her stop crying or get her to eat anything
[10:49] but once she looked at her aunt, she was all settled and ate too.
[10:52] All praise to the Lord.
[10:54] You people should have told me yesterday, I would have come immediately.
[10:58] Kabeer did you call Nawal?
[11:01] No. I called myself. I wanted to ask about Ilham. He told me so I came immediately.
[11:08] She's very much attached to you. She got better when she looked at you.
[11:13] I was thinking that unless you have a nanny arranged, I could take Ilham with me.
[11:21] Nawal how will you care for her? You'll be bothered...
[11:25] I'll not be bothered.
[11:27] Aaliya you saw how attached she is. I'll handle everything easily. You're busy in work,
[11:35] If this hadn't been, I wouldn't have asked.
[11:40] Kabeer, Nawal is alright.
[11:43] Nawal is so attached with her. She'll feel better if she's happy. Let her take her.
[11:51] Alright. As you find better. I'll get her things packed.
[11:57] Perfect.
[13:35] Mom, its time for our flight. We're leaving.
[13:40] Take care.
[13:42] Yes.
[13:44] Bye auntie.
[13:55] Its okay.
[14:06] Bye. Bye.
[14:30] Kabeer, I am thinking something.
[14:33] Yes. I can see. You're thinking very deep.
[14:37] What are you thinking?
[14:38] I mentioned it to Toqueer as well. He supported me as well.
[14:45] But what is it?
[14:49] Kabeer..
[14:51] You just don't want to remarry because the girl who'd come, she,
[14:58] might not accept Ilham or might not take good care of her.
[15:06] Yes. This is it.
[15:11] What I'm about to say, listen to it with a cool mind and then answer me.
[15:23] If, you marry Nawal, then..
[15:37] What? What are you saying?
[15:41] Why are you reacting this way? I didn't say anything wrong.
[15:45] Nawal is a very nice girl. She's mature and very sensible and,
[15:51] if you marry her, you won't even have to worry.
[15:56] She loves Ilham so much, she'll take care of her, more than anything.
[16:02] But this isn't possible.
[16:04] Why? Whats the harm in it?
[16:10] Ilham needs a mother's love
[16:14] and no matter how much you care for her, you cannot be her mother.
[16:24] Not for your own sake, you'll have to marry Nawal for Ilham's sake. Don't you see,
[16:33] Nawal is attached to Ilham. Who would care for more than her?
[16:38] But I've never thought about Nawal like that.
[16:42] See Kabeer, I'll not listen to you.
[16:46] You'll have to decide. Don't you like Nawal?
[16:51] No.
[16:56] Nawal is a very nice girl. She can be the ideal for any guy.
[17:02] So whats the problem?
[17:07] See if you have anything in your heart, tell me clearly.
[17:11] Even Toqueer has no objections.
[17:17] To tell you the truth, I don't think I'm worthy of Nawal.
[17:24] She deserves a better life partner than me.
[17:28] Why don't we let Nawal decide this for herself?
[17:33] Let me talk to Nawal. We'll accept whatever decision she takes.
[18:19] If not for your own, you'll have to marry Nawal for Ilham's sake.
[18:24] Don't you see how Nawal is attached to Ilham.
[18:28] Who could care for her, more than Nawal?
[18:33] Ilham isn't only my daughter, she's his daughter as well. He is her father.
[18:37] And I want him to take Nawal. I left her there.
[18:40] He sent her back immediately because mom and Nawal said so. You want independence and only my life to be destroyed.
[18:48] No. You're wrong Falak.
[18:51] You knew she's sick. You shouldn't have left her alone. If he's saying something to you now, listen to it quietly.
[19:06] I'm.. very upset at what Hamza did with you.
[19:15] I'm very upset about it.
[19:17] When Kabeer told me, I was shocked. And I'm sure,
[19:23] this is all Falak's doing.
[19:26] Falak did everything to get Hamza's money.
[19:32] Oh well, whatever is done, was bad for you.
[19:38] But I'm very happy that you gathered yourself very quickly.
[19:43] Actually Kabeer helped me a lot. He encouraged me alot.
[19:50] Do you know like you try to care for everyone,
[19:55] similarly, Kabeer also takes care of his family and friends, very much.
[20:02] He always tries to help and support as much as he can.
[20:08] There's no doubt about that.
[20:11] Had Kabeer not been around,
[20:15] I wouldn't have been able to get out of that phase.
[20:20] Nawal, I am here only for a little while.
[20:25] Basically I had to get a few of Hafsa's documents updated and,
[20:30] Toqueer asked me to get Ilham's passport and bring her along.
[20:38] You.. will you take Ilham along?
[20:42] I wanted to but,
[20:46] Kabeer isn't agreeing. He said he'll be alone.
[20:50] If you take her along, how will he feel settled here?
[20:57] Toqueer and I are worried for Kabeer.
[21:04] He is taking care of the business all alone and he has Ilham's responsibility on him as well.
[21:12] I suggested him to get married again.
[21:19] But he doesn't agree. He says who knows how that girl would be.
[21:24] Whether she'll take care of Ilham or not. He's just stuck over it.
[21:34] I tried to explain him that if the girl is good, she will take care of Ilham.
[21:44] Most definitely. Please look in your social circle, I'm sure, you'll find a nice girl.
[21:53] Nawal.. I want.. you to marry Kabeer..
[22:11] Sorry.. What are you saying, Aaliya?
[22:19] Nawal you will get married, somewhere. Why not Kabeer?
[22:24] Kabeer is very nice. No doubt. But..
[22:29] This way? All of a sudden. I don't know how to answer you.
[22:33] I understand. Its very confusing.
[22:38] See, if, Sultana aunty had been alive, I would have talked to her.
[22:49] She's not around so I'm forced to talk to you.
[22:57] You should think about it and answer me. Take your time.
[23:06] I know this is a difficult decision for you.
[23:13] But, remember this that I know, Kabeer will keep you very happy.
[24:06] What did the two of you think? I'd never find out whats going on between you two!
[24:10] Mind yourself Hamza!
Why should I mind myself?
[24:13] You're a cheap man. Weren't you a little bit ashamed?
[24:17] You're having an affair with your ex-wife's sister.
[24:25] I want you to marry Kabeer..
[24:44] Nawal?
[24:51] What is it? Ever since Aaliya left, you've been quiet.
[24:58] No. I'm not worried. You're just being doubtful.
[25:02] Am I? Then why are you sitting here all alone and thinking?
[25:08] Don't try and put me off. Tell me what did Aaliya say.
[25:19] Aaliya brought a proposal for me from Kabeer..
[25:25] What?
[25:27] She said he will get married again. 
[25:32] And rather than marrying someone who cannot care for Ilham, its better,
[25:40] that I should marry him.
What did you answer?
[25:45] I didn't say anything.
[25:48]  I cannot marry Kabeer, auntie. You know Hamza accused me.
[25:56] If I marry Kabeer, all those accusations prove to be right. 
[26:01] People will feel that whatever he said was right. 
[26:04] I can tolerate everything except people pointing their fingers at my character.
[26:12] I will not marry Kabeer.
[26:16] Kabeer is a very nice guy. He's sensible, sober.
[26:20] Falak mistreated him and his family and yet I never heard Kabeer badmouth her.
[26:29] Falak accused him terribly in her press conference. 
[26:32] Kabeer could have had a press conference in return and answered her accusations.
[26:39] But he didn't do that. Do you know why? 
[26:43] Because he respects Falak. He knows how to respect women.
[26:49] And you told me yourself 
[26:52] that he took care of you when you were sick. 
[26:57] He took you to the hospital and stayed there.
[27:05] Nawal, the hands that support you when you're falling apart,
[27:18] they're priceless. Don't let go of them.
[27:48] Mom, what happened to you? Why are you sitting like this?
[27:54] I just felt a little sick so I came here.
[27:59] You felt sick? Did you take your medicine?
[28:03] Yes. Its nothing. My heart just felt heavy.
[28:08] Mom, what are you thinking? Whats bothering you?
[28:14] Hamza..
[28:16] I'm worried about Hamza. 
[28:19] He has gone for several days and he hasn't even called me once.
[28:23] It has never been the case.
[28:25] Mom, he must be busy that's why he didn't call. He always calls you otherwise.
[28:34] Don't worry about it.
[28:36] How can I not worry about it dear? He's my only son and he has changed. 
[28:40] God knows what that girl is feeding him. I don't understand,
[28:44] Why can't he see all that you and I can see about her?
[28:50] Mom, everything has a time and perhaps its not time for Hamza's eyes to be open yet.
[28:56] But you'll see, the day his eyes open, he'll not even take a minute to throw Falak out of his life.
[29:03] I made a big mistake.
[29:05] I shouldn't have postponed Hamza and Nawal's wedding. 
[29:10] Had they been married, I wouldn't have had to see this day.
[29:14] Mom, its all fate. Maybe Nawal and Hamza weren't meant to be together.
[29:21] But you see, don't worry like that.
[29:25]  If you think about it, you'll not get anything except worries.
[29:30] See, its very late at night. Go to your room and rest. Staying up late isn't good for you.
[29:39] Nazish listen to me carefully. 
[29:42] Take over Raheel's business and bring it under your control. It needs to be done.
[29:50] Business in my control? But why? Why are you saying this? 
[29:54] Whats going on in your mind?
[29:57] I have a fear in my heart.
[30:00] The way this girl convinced Hamza to get married, 
[30:04] what if she convinces him to take over your business?
[30:11] I don't know what she's planning. I'm worried for you and Naveen. Please,
[30:19] take over your business and take control of it. I beg you.
[30:23] Mom, you're over thinking. Hamza isn't like that.
[30:27] He isn't a fool. He'll never do that.
[30:30] Right now he's the world's biggest fool.
[30:34] Look at what he's doing. He has forgotten us. He doesn't even bother.
[30:40] Alright mom, stop worrying. 
[30:44] Its very late and its not good for your health to be up so late.
[30:58] Nawal is a very nice girl. She's sensible and mature.
[31:02]  If you marry her, you won't be worried.
[31:06]  She loves Ilham so much, she'll care for her more than her own life.
[31:19] I told him to get married again. He doesn't agree. 
[31:23] He says he doesn't know how that girl would be and whether she'd care for Ilham. He's stuck over it.
[32:41] Hello Nawal, how are you?
[32:44] I'm fine. How are you?
[32:47] I'm fine. Can we talk, are you busy?
[32:52] Kabeer, you don't have to be so formal with me.
[32:56] Nawal, don't think I'm using Ilham as a shield to make you emotional and marry you.
[33:05] Its not like that.
[33:10] See Nawal, you don't have any pressure about it. Nobody is forcing you.
[33:17] Kabeer you're a nice guy.
[33:23] If I say I cannot marry you, will you not mind it?
[33:46] No. What are you saying? Whats there to mind about it?
[33:53] I'm embarrassed. You're a very nice man.
[33:57] Nawal you don't have to justify. 
[34:00] Its your right to say no. I told you nobody will force you.
[34:08] In fact, to tell you the truth, I'm very embarrassed. 
[34:14] I told sister Aaliya not to go there.
[34:17] And had she wanted to see you, she shouldn't say such a thing.
[34:22] Kabeer, you,
[34:26] know when Hamza accused me of being involved with you, I couldn't sleep for many nights.
[34:36] I was hurt with what he said. 
[34:40] If I marry you,
[34:44] Hamza's accusation will prove to be correct. People will feel we have something going on.
[34:52] People will start questioning. How many people will I answer? 
[34:57] You know the hardest thing for someone to do is to protect their character?
[35:05] You're telling the truth but people don't believe you.
[35:09] You're right. This does happen.
[35:17] But oh well, don't worry. I had an idea what your answer would be.
[35:25] Kabeer.. Aaliya said she'll call.
[35:30] No. I'll talk to her myself.
[35:32] Don't worry. She'll not call you and bother you.
[35:39] Thank you, Kabeer.
[36:15] Yes?
[36:18] Sir, Ms. Nawal asked me to give this file to you.
[36:21] Where is Ms. Nawal herself? Didn't I tell you to ask her to bring the file herself?
[36:24] Sir I told her but she said she's busy.
[36:28] Alright, you can leave.
Alright, sir.
[36:59] Hello?
[37:05] Can we talk?
[37:11] If you're not busy.
[37:14] Come in.
[37:21] Nawal, why are you avoiding me?
[37:26] I thought you'd be upset and it would be best if I don't face you for a few days.
[37:34] Nawal, I'm not upset with you at all. I've told you this earlier as well.
[37:43] And you have all the right to decide for your life, for yourself. 
[37:48] I have no objections, Nawal. You know what,
[37:53] I don't want to get married, again, myself.
[37:58] I was quiet because sister Aaliya forced me to. 
[38:02] I respect your decision Nawal. You don't have to worry about it now.
[38:10] Just relax.
[38:16] Yes, one more thing, I want you to overlook our medicine project as well.
[38:24] I'm sending the file. If you need any information, you can ask Qaiser.
[38:31] In fact, I'll do one thing. 
[38:33] I'll arrange a meeting with you, myself and Qaiser. You can ask any questions needed.
[38:40] We'll have a in detail discussion. What do you think?
[38:45] Okay.
[38:47] Good.
[39:24] Kabeer will you have tea, should I make it?
[39:26] No. I just had it a while ago.
[39:31] Actually I wanted to talk to you.
[39:35] Tell me. Is everything alright? All well in the office?
[39:38] Yes, everything fine in the office. 
[39:40] Actually, I don't want to get married again.
