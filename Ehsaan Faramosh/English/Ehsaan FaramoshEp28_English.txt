Weren't you even a little bit ashamed doing thing? Didn't you even think once? Do you know who told Aaliya about my adoption, mom?
She did. The one whose infront of me.
No Falak. You're mistaken. Aunt didn't talk to Aaliya.
I'm not mistaken. I know she told her everything. I heard Aaliya telling Touqeer that I wasn't Sultana's own daughter but an adopted child.
Didn't I tell you mom? Didn't I tell you that this woman couldn't see me happy? But you never listened. Now see for yourself.
My head is hurting thinking that my family would burn down my house. What is your problem? Why this animosity towards me?
Ask her mom.. 
Falak, listen to me. We'll sit and talk.
I don't want to hear anything mom. I am just thinking that if Kabeer finds out I'm adopted, I'll lose my respect in that house.
Kabeer.. Kabeer, you here?
What were you saying?
Whatever you said, is it true?
Please sit down. Why are you standing?
Auntie, is Falak not your daughter?
Kabeer, don't take me wrong, dear.
I wanted to tell you but everything happened so suddenly, I..
I couldn't get a chance.
You didn't get a chance or were your intentions not good?
I didn't think you were like this. And you Falak? You also sided with them and lied to me.
You hurt me. 
Kabeer please sit down and listen to me. Nobody wanted this.
I don't trust you anymore, Falak.
Kabeer, sit and talk. Mom, stop him. Kabeer.
Kabeer.. Kabeer.. Kabeer listen to me. You're mistaken. She's lying. Listen to me.
Can we sit and talk? Please, lets talk. Kabeer..
My daughter's house.. Nawal what will happen now?
Don't worry. 
Sultana trust me. I didn't say anything to anyone.
I feel anxious.
Now are you at peace? This is what you wanted. Now go and celebrate.
You wanted Kabeer to leave me. He is gone. He has left me.
Falak don't say like this. Every problem has a solution.
What will be the solution to this problem? Will you go and tell him whatever he heard was a lie.
 We will accept our mistake? They'll understand.
Its all because of her. Leave my house. Leave. Throw her out.
Falak, don't forget your manners.
If you cross your limit, you'll see the worse of me.
What can you do? What will you do?
Falak be quiet. What is aunt's fault in all this?
This is all because of her.
If she hadn't told Aaliya, this wouldn't have happened.
It wasn't her. It was her friend who told Aaliya.
Whoever said it, I am being punished for it. I am doomed. My house is destroyed.
We'll go wherever you like. You would like someplace.
I just like you.
You honored what I said, I'm happy for that.
How could I not honor you? I love you.
I think you're the return of my good deed that I did unknowingly.
And what if this blessing turns out to be a punishment?
Kabeer, you're back? Wait..
What happened? You look worried.
Where are you coming from?
I don't understand. Sultana aunty lied to us..
I can't believe it.
Did you know about it, Aaliya?
Tell me, I'm asking you. 
She did know but..
If you knew, why didn't you tell me? At least you should have told me.
She wanted to tell you but I told her not to.
But why?
Because the circumstances required me to be quiet for the best.
And now whatever the situation will be, have you people not thought about it?
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.
Don't you know how emotional Falak is? I did whatever I think was right. I don't think I made a mistake.
But..
Stop it please. Your complaints are right but its not Falak's fault.
When did I say Falak is at fault? But at least if she had told me herself, I wouldn't have been so shocked. Right now I don't understand how to react.
Hello?
Where are you lost? No calls or messages since morning.
No. Actually I'm not feeling well so I kept sleeping.
At least learn to lie properly. Now tell me whats worrying you.
What should I do? Should I tell him or not? What will Hamza think?
Nawal, are you there?
Actually Hamza, the thing is,
Falak is not my sister by blood.
What do you mean she's not your sister by blood?
I mean we had a servant, Sabir, she's his son. Mom and dad adopted her when he passed away.
You shouldn't have hidden this fact. A marriage isn't for a day or two. Its for the whole life.
You're right. We're upset. Whatever is done, is done. What can we do now? Nobody makes a mistake knowingly. We just act stupidly.
Who would want to hide their mistakes to let things go?
As far as I know Kabeer he's a very fair person. He will never tolerate this.
And not even only him, whoever is in his place would react the same way.
Please Hamza, I'm already worried. Don't worry me anymore.
I don't want to worry you. I'm just trying to explain you that a person needs to be fair in his relationships.
No you're right but please don't tell anything to auntie. What will she think about what type of people we are.
Don't worry. I understand.
And you Falak? You lied to me, siding with them.
No Kabeer, sit down please. Nobody wanted this. Listen..
I don't trust you anymore.
She wanted to tell you but I said no.
But why?
Because the circumstances required me to be quiet for the best.
Don't you know how emotional Falak is? Whatever I thought was right at that time, I did that. I don't think I made a mistake.
The number you're trying to call is busy at the moment.
You didn't get a chance or did you intend to deceive?
Mom?
You haven't slept?
Even you're awake..
When your daughter's life is being questioned,
mothers lose their sleep.
Mom, why are you thinking like this? Nothing will happen to Falak. Everything will be alright.
If they don't understand what we say?
Why won't they understand? We didn't commit a sin. Its not a sin to support an orphan.
I kept hiding it like a sin, Nawal. Time has proven this, Nawal.
Hiding it was wrong.
That's why we're wrong today.
But whatever you did, not everybody can do that.
Don't worry. We'll talk and make them understand. I hope they'll try to understand.
I pray to God, it happens.
You know Falak, she is very emotional. What if she does something?
We're facing all this because of her emotional immaturity.
But oh well, don't think about it. Okay? Everything will be alright. Get some rest.
As God wills.
I'm sorry dear. I was worried about Falak and forgot about your happiness. Did you talk to Hamza?
Yes I did talk to Hamza.
I told him the truth about Falak.
What did you do? Why did you tell him?
If Hamza..
Hamza is not like that. He understands. As it is, we hid the truth once and now we know the consequences.
I don't want to incur any loss in our relationships.
Alright, now don't be sad. Stop crying. Its very late. Sleep now.
Hello? Aaliya, where is Kabeer? Make him talk to me.
He went to the office in the morning. Call him.
You're lying. I know he's with you. Why are you doing this with me?
Why would I lie to you, Falak? Kabeer went to the office in the morning. Problems don't get solved with tears. Be strong.
My house is breaking apart. Didn't you want this?
I've never wanted this, Falak.
Your disillusions will hurt you further.
I tried to make Kabeer understand. I trust he'll understand but when, even I don't know. If we build relationships on truth, we don't fear they'll fall apart.
Don't worry, give him some time. It takes time to smooth out broken relationships.
Falak?
What happened? Were you talking to Kabeer?
You heard him yesterday. He isn't talking to me. Will everything be alright, Nawal?
We'll talk. Mom and I will go. Don't worry. Listen, take care. Okay?
I'm going to work, I have some important meetings. I'll try to come home early but you'll have to do one thing until I come.
You'll not just lock yourself in the room. Promise me?
Alright? Okay.
Very impressive, Mr. Hamza. I expect the delivery will be better than this.
Don't worry about it. If this contract is finalized, you'll know how we work too.
We came here because we knew. You know there are a lot of companies to get this contract, just like you.
But because your market reputation is very strong, we thought we should contact you first.
Thank you. We'll try our best to work according to your demand.
Alright. We'll wait for your qoutation.
We will finalize everything after we see it.
Alright.
It was nice meeting all of you.
Same here. Thank you.
Have you had lunch? Alright. I'm sending you the location. We'll have lunch together.
You have no option to say no. 2.30? Okay. Bye.
You don't have to scold me on the phone. I'm here.
You will never grow out of the habit of coming late.
No.
I like it when you wait for me.
Hamza you know the situation at home.
Mom and Falak are so worried. I came because there was an important meeting at work and now you called for lunch..
Okay relax.
I wanted to reduce your stress thats why I called you here.
But Hamza..
No Nawal. I'm not just associated to your happiness but your worries too. I might not be able to solve them, but,
I can support you.
Your support is very important to me.
I know. You will always find me close to you.
So lets order. I have to reach home. Mom and I have to visit Kabeer's place.
Sure.
Kabeer? 
You here?
I want to talk to you.
Falak, I cannot talk right now.
Is your work more important than me?
Don't look at me with a stranger's eyes. I won't be able to bear it.
Falak..
This isn't the right place for all this. I'll come home and talk.
Do you know why I hid the truth? I was scared of losing you Kabeer.
I was scared that my truth will take you away from me?
Did you think my love for you was so weak?
Would it end because of a truth that didn't have you at fault?
If I'm not at fault, why are you punishing me?
Because I didn't expect,
that the person I love the most in the world, will lie to me. She'll hide her truth from me.
Would you have married me if you had known the truth?
You wouldn't have. You need courage to listen to the truth. I've been scared all my life of people taunting me.
My fear stopped me from telling you. But still if you think,
that I am wrong, I'm at fault, punish me as you like.
My only fault is that I was born in a poor home. 
Falak..
Don't pity me. I cannot see pity in your eyes, for me.
If you can forgive me, call me out.
I'll wait for you.
Whatever happened between Falak and Kabeer, you must be aware of it.
Yes.
See we're embarrassed that we shouldn't have hidden this.
At least you people accepted that Falak isn't your daughter. When I came to your house,
you said I was lying.
We're very embarrassed. We thought if matters escalate, it would create problems for Falak.
You were wrong. You people didn't commit a crime that you had to hide it. It was a good deed.
Aaliya, people had scared us.
She wanted to tell you but I said no. She's not at fault. Falak is my daughter.
I have never differentiated between Nawal and Falak.
In fact, I have favored Falak over Nawal. I educated her and brought her up.
I never let her feel less in anything. I kept her like my child. Tell me how could I say, she's not my daughter.
You're very sensible. Please prove your sensibility and make Kabeer understand. Don't punish Falak for our fault.
See, a mistake was made.
It will take some time but things will be alright. I'm trying.
See I know Falak was wrong in a lot of things she did with you.
She's very emotional but she doesn't have a bad heart. Please forget what she did.
Don't repeat the past.
I've forgotten everything. Trust me, I don't want Falak's house to be destroyed.
Thank you. 
I expected you would understand.
I'm happy you people came. Please help yourself..
Please don't be formal. We just wanted to come and talk.
But since you're here, please have something at least.
Nazish, tell me did you get your visa?
Its done? That's such good news. I'll organize everything and tell you the dates. Then you can plan. Of course.
Are the kids alright? Give my love to them. Yes, as God wills. I'll call you.
Yes. Alright dear. Take care. Bye.
Is everything okay?
Yes. Nazish called. Her visa is stamped. She said to tell her the wedding dates so that she can plan her trip.
That's great. You can go and talk to Sultana aunty tomorrow.
Whats the rush? I'll go.
I was saying for you. You're in a rush for everything.
I understand everything. I'll go and finalize a date tomorrow. Alright?
I was thinking I'd send Nazish the dates so that she can shop for Nawal from there.
No matter how much she shops there, she's going to come here and visit malls.
Obviously she's excited. Its her brother's wedding. Why won't she be excited?
Zakia? 
Yes mam Nawal?
Where is Falak?
She went out.
Out?
Yes she didn't say anything but she looked very angry.
God knows where this girl went.
Where did you go?
I went to meet Kabeer.
But why?
We told you not to.
Alright, so what did he say?
He said I lied and deceived him.
He thought my love was a lie. How should I make him trust me?
We talked to Aaliya. She will make Kabeer understand.
I don't trust that woman.
She would have gotten a chance to fill in Kabeer's ears. Thats why Kabeer treated me so harshly.
Don't blame others when you're at fault, Falak.
If you think I'm at fault, fine. But let me tell you people.
If Kabeer leaves me, I'll kill myself.
Falak.. Falak..
I didn't expect the girl I love the most in the world to lie to me and hide her truth.
Kabeer, I am serving dinner. Come and eat with us.
I'm not hungry. You people eat.
See, I know you're angry but being angry doesn't mean you go on a hunger strike.
Listen, Sultana and Nawal came today. They were apologizing.
They are very embarrassed. They said Falak wasn't at fault.
They're really embarrassed Kabeer. You also have a big heart and finish matters.
See we have to compromise and ignore a lot of things if you want to stay happily married. And yours is a love marriage.
You fell in love at first sight and when in love such small things don't matter.
Its love thats why I'm hurting.
Because these relationships are based on the truth. Had they told me this earlier, I would have valued them more.
But now.. I'm hurt.
I'm hurt.
Misunderstanding.
I know..
Nazish called, she's so excited. She has her visa. She said she'll make all arrangements herself once she's here.
This is great news.
I was thinking I didn't give you an update since long so I'd tell you, we're making all arrangements. Why not have a date then?
A date..
Alright.
So lets finalize the last Friday of the next month.
Alright. If you people find this date befitting, we have no objections.
Lovely. Congratulations.
Congratulations to you too.
Falak, dear get some sweets.
Yes mom.
I was thinking I'd get the shopping done. I wanted to go myself. Thank you dear.
But then I thought since Nazish is coming, we'll do things together.
Nawal dear, call Nazish, she wants to talk to you.
Sure.
The sweets are very good.
Mom I don't understand, how can you finalize Nawal's wedding in such circumstances?
Falak, dear.
I don't want to get her married in these circumstances but I'm helpless.
Whats the emergency that the wedding cannot be put off?
One of your daughters is back home and you're getting the other one married. What should I think? You don't care for me.
Dear, its nothing.
And the wedding isn't immediately. If God wills, we'll solve all problems until the wedding.
Let it be, mom.
Falak? Falak, dear, are you okay? Is everything alright?
I'm feeling dizzy.
Falak? Dear.. Nawal.. Get water.
How long has she been in this condition?
Since a day or two. Actually we have a few problems and she was tensed so she got sick.
I don't think she's tensed because of a problem. She's pregnant.
What? What did you say?
She's expecting.
All praise to the Lord.
But she's very weak. I think she doesn't take care of her diet. Give her multivitamins regularly.
And take care of her diet.
Alright. Thank you so much. I'll see you off. Thank you.
Don't cry like this.
Congratulations..
Oh, why are you crying? We have such good news after such a long time.
Now you'll see how everything will be alright.
Its being ungrateful if you cry at such a happy occasion.
What can I do expect crying?
I'll just call Aaliya and I believe they'll come running.
I believe as soon as Kabeer gets the news, he'll forget everything.
My child. 
Congratulations to you too, aunt.
Kabeer?
Yes?
You came home early from office.
Yes. Just like that. Are you going somewhere?
Wait here. I'm coming.
Wait..
She's coming. Come here with me. Its been long we didn't talk. Tell me whats going on in your life.
Eat this. Here.
What is all this for?
First eat then I'll tell you.
But whats the happy occasion?
You're about to be a father, by the grace of God. Congratulations.
What?
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Nawal called a little while ago. She told me.
Oh, whats wrong? Why are you so upset? Its a happy occasion. You should come with us.
In fact I'll say, lets bring Falak home. She shouldn't be there. In this condition, she should be home.
Alright, as you wish.
Lets go.
Aaliya..
