Actually we want to inform Kabir's family about you before fixing the date!
What do you want to inform? That I'm actually the daughter of a servant.
You know what will happen after that! They'll reject the proposal.
Won't you ask about your sisters visit to Pakistan?
She would be coming to meet me! Why should I ask?
No! I called her for a special mission.
What is the special mission?
Your marriage!
When aunt Fareeha talked about Falak...
Did you notice the face of Sultana aunt?
Your are right!
I found it weird too!
I feel like there's something weird.
Falak! You here?
Why are you so stunned? Can I not visit my future husband's office?
You can surely visit!
You done with the meeting? Should we go on a lunch?
Falak! I cannot ! Actually I have lots of work load. It is not possible for me to go there.
Hello!  Hello sister Aliya!
Do you know that I'm in office? I'm here to ask him out for a lunch and he isn't listening to me.
You should speak with him.
Yes sister in law! I've told her that I have an important meeting. We'll plan later.
She is forcing to go today!
You should tell him. He'll listen to you!
You should go! If Falak is requesting then you should go.
But sister in law! The meetings are really important.
Then what! Sister Aliya will look after the meetings! Right?
Don't worry! I'll handle.
Fine sister in law! Thank you! I'm sorry!
Falak! What is this blackmailing?
Should we go?
Lets go!
Sure! Lets go!
What happened Kabir? Why is your mood off?
Falak! I stopped you but you still came to office.
Then what? I wanted to meet you.
Falak! I had meetings.
When the boss isn't attending the meetings. There can be problems.
Fine! Meetings are more important than me.
Nobody is more important to me than you but you should think that sister Aliya would've minded it.
sister Aliya keeps her personal life and professional life differently!
Sure Kabir! You can drop me to my house. I don't want to go to anyplace.
You should attend your meeting! I thought..
We'll have fun together and talk! But I was wrong! I shouldn't have came.
You just don't care about a persons heart.
Emotions don't matter to you! You should drop me to my home.
Falak! Spending time together and outings can happen after official timings.
This isn't the way that we can do this all the time or whenever you say.
Kabir! If you stay bound like this when you have your own business, what's the point of life. A 9 to 5 job is better.
At least you are available for your relations in such a life.
Falak! Your own business is ran after you take all the responsibilities.
This isn't any 9 to 5 job! I have to stay available for 24/7. This is a restaurant business.
Tell me quickly! Where do you want to go and what do you want to eat?
What should I tell! You should just drop me to home.
For God sake Falak! Why don't you understand? I have to reach!
OK fine Kabir! You should park here. I'll go to home by cab. I won't call to meet you or anything after today.
I made a mistake! Relation is more important than business?
This business can facilitate you! It can provide you money!
but It'll never give you that happiness which you'll find with a life partner.
Falak! What should I tell you?
Fine! I'm sorry that I got rude at you! I'm really sorry!
Kabir! Please drop me here! I'll go home by using a cab.
Falak! I'm saying that I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you!
So now you want me to apologize?
Navaal!
You didn't leave?
I got a little late!
It's late! I'll drop you.
No! I'll go! I have my car.
Navaal! How will you travel alone at this time?
It's not safe! I'll drop you!
Why? Why can't I go alone?
It's 9! I've left the office at this time before. Don't need to get worried for me.
Don't you trust me?
It's not about trust! I don't need any help.
It hurts when you expect form strangers who leave you when you need them.
Can't you forgive me?
I'll forgive by my tongue! But I cannot forgive you from my heart.
A life is needed to tell this heart.
Hey groom! Have you selected the card for your marriage?
The card will be selected by sister in law.
It's your marriage! You have to select! Understood? Now you are getting married.
Your room decor and furniture! Your wardrobe will be selected by you! All of this will be selected by you. I'm not responsible. Right Tauqeer?
You are right!
Stop giving responsibilities to my wife! You should call Falak and ask her about everything.
I want the same!
Wait brother!
You both cannot cut yourself out of this responsibility.
Why?
This is the reason!
My wedding decor and venue is supposed to be decided by sister in law. My dress too!
But then! I want relaxation from so many office work.
After that! We haven't selected wedding cards. What will be the venue and food.
The dresses for bride and groom. This is a lot of work. I don't know Tauqeer. How will I do this?
Don't worry! You'll manage everything! I trust you!
I know why you trust me! But I don't trust you! Whenever I go for shopping, you'll join me.
If you both are good for shopping. You should do shopping for me.
See!
Seriously Tauqeer?
He wants me to do everything for him and I have to do many things on my own too.
Take him to a designer and help him choose the dresses for functions.
Tell me! Which card should we select?
Here! See this!
Sister in law! You should choose it!
He is right! You should choose it yourself.
If you rely on us! Cards will be decided after marriage.
This is good! You both team up.
Ok show me
I like this! I think that there should be more options like this.
Hello!
I'm Hamza!
I was just worried that have you reached home safely?
I told you that you don't need to be worried for me.
My life isn't that easy!
You think that my life was easy?
You chose that life! Nobody asked you or forced you.
Your dream was more important to you!
I'm ashamed!
I chose dreams over relations.
I shouldn't have done it!
If I knew that you are not the part of my dreams then I would've never chose dreams.
I thought that you'll be happy about me going overseas and becoming successful.
I would be happy!
I was just hurt because you didn't tell me.
I got to know when you left!
Navaal! I missed a flight for you! I waited for you but your number was powered off.
I ask for forgiveness.
You said it Navaal! lovers cannot stay mad at each other for too long.
I was wrong! I feel bad.
I was wrong too! I'm ashamed.
Well! You got what you wanted.
You shouldn't feel ashamed!
That's why I feel ashamed! That I'm actually empty from my heart.
I've lost the most important part of my life.
I've settled myself after so many difficulties and hardships.
I cannot get hurt again! Don't call me again!
Hello!
How are you?
I'm mad at you! You didn't come to pick me up from the airport.
I've waited for you the whole day and you didn't even meet me.
I came to your room but you were sleeping!
I slept for 2 minutes and you decided to dodge me.
It's not like that!
Whatever! Tell me about your kids.
They had school so I couldn't bring them. I just came for 2 weeks.
I wanted to meet you and mother!
It's good that you came! I have a tour to Canada next month. Please sit!
Hamza! You should think about something separate from business.
I mean about your life.
What is wrong with my life? Everything is fine.
I'm talking about your marriage!
Mother is worried!
You should at least think about her.
She is alone in the house.
A mother is happy after she watches her son get married.
I'll get married! It's not like that I won't get married.
I just need sometime.
Tell me that do you like somebody?
I told you that I need sometime!
I don't think that mother wants to wait! She has specially called me for this purpose.
She just wants me to convince you and talk to you.
Listen Hamza! If you like any girl! Do tell us. If you don't!
You should listen to mother!
Mother was telling that Aliya told her about a girl.
She is nice and her family is nice too!
Me and mother are serious for her! Now you should just decide quickly!
Fine! You look tired! You should rest a bit. We'll talk tomorrow.
OK!
Yes?
Yes? How's your mood?
It doesn't effect you!
Why? What are you saying?
You didn't call! I was waiting.
Why were you waiting? You should have called me.
No! I made a promise today.
That I won't start the love.
People who start the love get ignored like me.
Falak! Please forget it!
Sure! I'll forget it! But you have to promise me that you will not act like that again.
Sure! I promise! Such thing will not happen again.
I'll forget the purpose of this video call.
These are the cards for our wedding. Select the card. I don't understand. You should help me.
I need you to suggest me the cards! This is card number 1
Here is card number 2. This is the card number 3.
This is the best.
Really? This is nice.
Kabir! Why are we selecting? Didn't sister Aliya help you with it?
sister Aliya wants me to do it! And I want you to choose.
Kabir! When will we do shopping for wedding?
We talked! Now it's on sister Aliya! Whenever she decides to take me.
I don't know if she'll even ask me!
sister Navaal said that bride decides for the shopping of marriage.
Then I thought that sister Aliya won't take me!
She might call you tomorrow.
If she does! Let her do it on her own. You should not talk to her about this.
She might think bad about me!
You do over thinking! Don't think like this! sister Aliya will think good for you.
Sure! Then I'll wait.
Sultana! You can adopt a child but you should be careful that the child can become dangerous for your own children.
This is a gift from my side for Falak's marriage!
Brother! No need for this. Thank you!
You people should just be a part of the wedding. That's honorable for me.
Obviously we will come! It's happy news for our family.
Keep it as a gift!
If Falak is your daughter! She is our daughter too.
And don't get hurt by the words of Fareeha.
I know brother! It's her habit.
I didn't tell Fareeha about this cheque! You should not talk about it too.
Brother! Why is she jealous of Falak so much?
She has her own opinion. She just thinks that your actual children deserve the love. One should not invest on an adopted one.
It's not like that! She is wrong.
Sultana! You can adopt a child but you should be careful that the adopted child can become dangerous for your own children.
Be careful!
Falak shouldn't affect on Navaal's future.
You should not worry! I won't let Navaal be affected by anything.
And yes! You should not worry. Take more money from me if you want to!
Thank you brother!
Sister! Do it quickly! I have some more work to do.
Hey! You are not going anywhere.
I have to do a lot of shopping! Stay here with me.
You should do it! What's my need?
Where are you going?
You do shopping! I'll be back!
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere! I'm here! You should do your shopping!
This color doesn't suit you!
This blue color will suit you a lot!
You?!
Don't be scared! I'm not stalking you!
I brought sister to shopping!
She is here?
Yes! Since 2 days.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Sister! This is Navaal! My company's finance manager.
How are you?
I'm fine! How are you? How are your kids?
You know about my kids?
Yes! Actually me and Hamza were together in the university. That's how I deeply know about you guys.
Sorry! Wait a second.
Yes Falak! Sure! I'm coming.
I'm so sorry! I have to leave.
Sure!
Who was she?
She is my company's finance manager.
I know but you both were in the same university! What is it?
I feel shy!
Hamza!
Sister in law!
Are you going somewhere?
Yes! I had to do shopping for Falak! I decided to do it today.
Oh! you should take Falak too.
Obviously I'll take her when I need her! I'm just going to buy some casual dresses for her. That's why!
Sure! You should buy everything according to yourself but do ask her about her choice too. So she doesn't feel bad.
She is the bride! It's obvious that I'll buy everything according to her choice.
You had to go to your designer today! Get ready for it.
I almost forgot! Thank you!
I'll take her too! Don't worry.
Hamza! You are hiding something from us. Tell me what it is or I'll find out myself.
It's all on you!
I like Navaal!
What?
Seriously?
Why didn't you tell us before?
I didn't think that I had to tell.
Me and mother are worried about your marriage and you already like a girl.
Now you are saying that there's nothing to tell?
Hamza! You behave so weirdly sometimes.
Why didn't you tell? You didn't know that we were so much worried.
Sister please! We are in a shopping mall. Not in our house.
Yes! But I'll tell mother that you like your colleague.
No! Please don't tell mother about this. I don't want my mother to know about it.
Why Hamza? It's good to tell her.
You don't even know that you have helped us with our worries.
Me and mother will go to her house tomorrow and talk to her about marriage.
What are you saying? You won't do anything like this. You won't tell mother! You will not go to Navaal's house.
Why? Is she not interested in you?
We'll talk later!
You do your shopping! I'll be back after attending this call.
Shaheen! Bring water for me.
Wow! Are you guys back?
Mother! We just bought 4 dresses.
You guys came so late and just brought 4 dresses?
She didn't like anything!
It's not like that! My wedding is luxurious! My dresses should be branded.
Sure! Buy everything according to her. No compromises.
Here!
What is this?
Brother came and gave this cheque for Falak's wedding!
Mother! What is the need for this? We'll manage!
I told him the same.
But he said that if Falak is your daughter! She is our daughter too.
I couldn't argue with him.
You are my mother!
Whatever you are doing! It's enough. We are doing great. We don't need to take money.
Kabir's family doesn't want dowry! So you should return this to him.
Darling! This is your wedding gift.
I cannot return this!
Mother! Falak is right. We don't need this. We'll manage.
Do you guys know? If you return a gift! It's just like slapping that person. You want my brother to get mad at me.
No at all! I'll keep this cheque. We might need it later. You guy don't understand.
Show me what you guys brought!
Show what you chose!
This is my choice.
So Hamza! Tell me about Navaal!
You like her?
Since when? Does she know about your feelings?
I think this isn't the right time to talk on this topic.
What? Why are you dodging this topic?
So you want me to tell everything to mother! And she handles everything according to herself.
I think that I did wrong by telling you!
Listen Hamza! You and Navaal are university fellows!
You both know each other! If Navaal matches our status and belongs to a good family then why not?
Actually! I created a mess long time back. I'm just being punished.
Tell me! I'm listening!
Listen Hamza! Tell me the reason. I can't do anything. Did she reject you?
Just think this! She doesn't want to marry me.
How could she do this?
How can a girl reject a boy like you?
Does she like somebody else?
I never asked her!
Now tell me Hamza! What do you want?
Please talk to mother and close the topic of marriage! I get irritated.
Listen Hamza!
She'll keep trying until she finds the reason.
It looks like you don't have anything to talk about except the topic of marriage.
I don't want to get married. I want to focus on business.
Please inform her! Please!
Hello!
Come to the balcony!
Right now?
Yes! Right now!
You here!
Yes! I wanted to see you! That's why I came here.
Why are you standing outside? Come inside!
No! I won't come inside!
I'll watch you from here.
What is this? Wait! I'm coming.
Why don't you come inside?
Let's go somewhere out! Where should we go?
Wherever you say!
Let's go to someplace you like!
I just like you!
Sure! Let's go to the place I like. Let's eat something.
No! I didn't tell mother.
We'll return in an hour.
Look at my dressing!
You look beautiful!
You think I'm joking?
Look at yourself from my eyes!
You don't trust me?
I trust you!
Sit!
Door!
Navaal!
Mother! You should have called me.
Nothing! I wanted to talk to you.
What is it?
Sit!
I know!
You feel hurt when I talk about this again and again!
You won't understand my worries! I'm a mother.
Mother! Tell me.
My friend called me!
She told me about a proposal! the boy works in an IT firm.
He is engineer too.
Mother! I've told you that I don't want to get married.
Sure! Don't marry.
We'll see the boy! If you like him. We'll just do engagement.
Marriage will happen according to you!
Mother! Falak is getting married. So much is going on already.
You should focus on that!
Everything will happen.
Just give me the permission for it. If they are good. If you like them! We'll just do engagement.
If you get engaged before your sisters marriage.
You don't even know! My mind can rest.
You are forcing me!
It seems like you want to get rid of me.
You are so stupid! I won't ever be like that.
Why are you forcing?
Falak is getting married because it was written for her. I'll get married to when it's written for me.
I want to marry a family where I bring you with me! I don't want to leave you alone.
My darling!
Daughter depart from house.
Parent's don't!
Tell me about the arrangement for wedding!
It's happening! Everything is going smoothly!
That's great! Where is Falak?
I was going for shopping! I came here to pick her up. So she can buy everything according to herself.
She is in her room! She'll come. 
Shaheen! Go and call Falak! Tell her that Aliya is here to pick her up.
Our house is surrounded with happiness.
That's great!
Where is Navaal?
Navaal is busy with her job! She can only enjoy when she comes back.
Goes for shopping!
Falak is here!
Greetings! 
 Greetings!
How are you?
I'm fine! I don't have time. I'm going for shopping. I have to take you with me. Go and get ready quickly.
Really? I thought that a bride gets ready according to groom's side.
Why?
It's your wedding! You are the bride! Everything will happen according to you.
Sure! I'll be back.
She is excited!
Yes! She looks happy!
Hello!
You? Here?
Yes!
I came here to meet you!
Me? Everything alright?
Yes! I wanted to talk.
Sure! sit!
Speak!
Navaal! It's personal! But it's important!
Speak! I'm listening!
Hamza told me that you've rejected his proposal.
I want to know the reason for it.
Hamza didn't tell you the reason?
No!
You should ask it! After you know! You'll think that I did right.
Do you like someone else?
That's a very personal question!
I don't share everything.
Navaal! If you don't like anyone else. Then please think about Hamza and forgive him.
He is a gentleman!
I'm not saying that because he is my brother! No!
He is actually kind hearted and he loves you a lot!
You should at least give him a chance.
It's better that you ask your brother about this!
then you should talk to me after that. 
Excuse me!
