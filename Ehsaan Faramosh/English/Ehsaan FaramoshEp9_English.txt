I wasn't expecting you to come.
How could I not come? I promised you. I had to come.
Thank you. You're here all alone?
I'm still single, sister in law.
I didn't mean that. Where is Sofia aunty and Nazish? I requested them to be here specially.
They really wanted to come but Nazish's daughter felt unwell all of the sudden to they had to leave for Canada.
Oh. I'll call and ask here. Oh Falak. Come meet her.
Hello.
Hello.
This is a small gift for you.
Thank you.
By the way, this is Nawal. Falak's elder sister.
And this is a Hamza. Owner of Hamza Industries and Real Estate.
He's also our business partner in our new venture.
I know her. She works in my office. We have interacted a lot.
You didn't give any reaction.
Mam, one picture please.
Yes sure. Come along. Hamza come on.
Please send me these pictures as well, sister in law. I am really enjoying a wedding after such a long time.
Sure.
Thank you.
I'll just go see mom.
Sure.
Do you need anything else?
No. Thank you dear.
If you could ask me if I needed something, I'd really like it.
There are so many people who could ask you.
I don't think me asking you will make any difference to you.
Why won't it? You're the host and I'm the guest.
Do you want anything?
Yes. You as my partner.
Listen to me.
You look really beautiful today. I had always wanted to see you like this.
You've never dolled up, ever.
Maybe once in our university function. How many years has it been?
Hamza stop it. You don't have to pretend anything.
I'm not pretending. This is my love for you.
Hamza please stop it. Everybody in the office knows already, now do you want everybody here to know as well?
Why are you always so upset with me?
You know the reason to this, very well.
Come along. Be careful.
Alright...
Wait a second. Nasreen..
Come. Now recite God's name before you enter the house. Alright. Be careful.
May God bless your presence in this house.
Amen.
Where is the photographer? Click our family picture now. Hurry up.
Congratulations everybody. Especially my brother. May God bless you with all the happiness.
Thank you. And you sister in law, thank you so much.
You have played the most important part in making my ordinary life, special.
And for making this house, a home.
Now lets take Falak to our home. Come along.
My wife has completed one of her duties today. She has completed this family.
Aaliya, today, thank you so much.
What is this? Thank God that our Kabeer has all the happiness in the world.
Had uncle and aunty been alive today, they would have been very happy.
Aaliya you've shown everyone that relationships aren't only made by blood, but the more stronger ones are made with care and consideration.
This is my house. Our happiness, sadness, everything is one. Falak,
when I got married and came here, my mother in law gave me these bangles.
Today I'm giving them to you.
Thank you.
May you be happy forever. May God bless you with all the happiness there is.
Kabeer, now since you have such a beautiful wife, don't forget your sister in law.
Oh no, sister in law. What are you saying?
I'm just teasing you.
Now will you guys keep talking or get some sweets for the bride.
Nasreen hurry up and get some sweets.
I had always wanted to see you all dolled up like this. You've never gotten ready like this.
Mom, give me some too..
Oh..
What did you do?
Dear, what did you do?
She destroyed my bridal dress, Kabeer.
Falak I'm sorry. She didn't do it deliberately. She's a kid, she made a mistake. Don't worry.
Naseer go and get something to clean it up.
Let it be. Whats done is done.
See, I realize, what is going on in your heart.
This is your bridal dress and every girl has emotional attachment with her bridal dress, I know.
Its alright Falak. Its okay. She made a mistake.
Dear, go and play with your cousins. What are you doing with all the elders?
I don't want to go. I want mama to give me the sweets.
Hafsa dear, you should listen to me sometimes.
Kabeer take me to my room.
Alright come. Hafsa dear, give your aunt some space.
Go Kabeer.
Whats wrong Falak? Your mood is still off?
Today is the beginning of our new life. Will you start it like this?
Didn't you see what happened? Everything happened in front of you. Why are you asking me?
This is the first I've seen a bride getting such a welcome.
Falak whatever happened, nobody knew it would happen.
And Hafsa? She is a small child. She didn't spill the dessert on your dress deliberately.
Kabeer you have no idea what my emotions are right now.
Whatever is done, is done. Cheer up. How sits in such a bad mood on the first night of their wedding?
I had thought so much Kabeer.
You hadn't seen me completely in that dress. You hadn't complimented me.
Falak I cannot see you upset.
Look at me.
You look beautiful in this dress as well.
You're just lying to keep my heart.
Not at all. Look at yourself with my eyes.
Falak you don't need expensive and heavy dresses to look beautiful. I mean it.
This is our first night after our wedding. And you're wasting such precious moments only because a dress was spoiled.
Falak. Relationships, emotions, connections,
and love. All these are worth more than things.
Falak please. I don't want to see you cry for such small things after today.
I wanted to come in this room and see you in your wedding dress. I wanted to compliment you.
But trust me, I'm so happy to have you in my life that I don't even want to think about such a thing.
Kabeer I'm so sorry. I got very emotional. You're right.
Its okay. Alright so now smile.
Now we're talking. I want to see my love smiling like this. Always.
This is for you. A present from me. I know this isn't worth anything in front of your beauty.
But I hope you'll like it.
This.. This is so beautiful.
Do you like it?
Yes. Very much. Its very beautiful. Thank you so much.
Hafsa's small mistake made such a big spectacle in front of all the guests.
Its alright. She's a child. It happens.
It is Hafsa's mistake, Aaliya. She's growing up. She should understand such things. Its high time.
I made her understand.
I was thinking about Falak.
It is her first day in the house. God knows what she must be thinking. It was a big mess.
She's a sensible girl. I'll apologize to her in the morning.
Alright then. You must be tired as well. Lets go and rest. Come.
So is everything ready? I hope you didn't get anything from the market.
Nothing. Everything is home made.
Thats very good. Now keep everything carefully in the car. Don't miss anything.
Mom, I'll get it done. Don't worry.
Just that everything should reach there carefully.
Only if Safdar and Fariha had come along, it would have been great.
Mom, they left so late at night and you know aunt very well.
You called, didn't you? You fulfilled your responsibility. She cannot complain now.
Its good that she said no herself. I didn't want her to go there.
What if she had said something wrong there. Its Falak's in laws' house. We'll have to be careful.
God has a better plan for everything.
Had you been feeling well and came along, it would have been different.
Now lets get everything. Hurry up or you'll be late. Apologize to Aaliya and give my love to Falak.
Tell her I'll come meet her.
Done. Lets keep everything in the car now.
Be careful. You'll get oil on your clothes.
I'll see you.
Thank God.
How can a person change their color so quickly. Everything is changed. Your walk, your attitude. I don't believe that you...
They should come and see now. They call me a servant's daughter.
A servant's daughter owns such a big house now.
It will be fun when I see her face. They'll be envious of me. Nobody has a fate like me.
Listen..
Hello mam.
Hello. Who are you taking this for?
Its for you and Kabeer sir, mam.
Give it to me, I'll take it.
I'll drop it mam.
Who am I in this house?
You're the owner.
So you'll do as I say. Give it to me.
Oh Kabeer, where are you going?
I'm going to the gym.
Here's your tea. I made it myself for you.
Oh wow. You made this tea?
Hmm. Falak, its the first day after our wedding and you've started working.
So what? This is my house.
And as it is, I've decided Kabeer. I'll do all your chores myself.
This is my good luck but we have servants to do things around the house. Now leave this.
You don't have to do anything. They'll do everything and even take care of you.
I want you dolled up all the time. In front of me.
Is this so? Now drink your tea and tell me how it is?
It must be good. How can it be bad since you made it?
Wow. Wow.
Thank you. I hope you're not giving me fake compliments.
Of course not. This tea, before gym.
Hello sister. Did you reach safely?
Yes arrived safely.
How is Naveen now?
She's better than before. Thank God she's out of danger.
You should have come along Hamza.
You know sister, how much work keeps me busy.
I'm trying to find a few days free. I'll definitely come and visit Naveen.
Don't worry. She'll be absolutely fine by the grace of God.
As God wills.
Where is mom, I want to talk to her.
She is with Naveen in the hospital. I just came home. I need to pick a few things up.
Alright, I'll call her myself.
Alright. You do that.
Okay. Bye.
Good morning. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm good.
Look at me. Tell me how do I look?
You look absolutely beautiful. Cast away all evil eyes. Where is Kabeer?
He went to the gym.
Didn't mom come with you?
No she was unwell so I asked her to rest and I'd bring your breakfast along.
Falak, this set is so beautiful. Who gave you this?
Kabeer gave me this as a wedding present.
Its beautiful. Are these diamonds?
Yes diamonds and its very expensive.
I had never thought I'd be able to afford such expensive things.
You're very lucky you have someone who loves you so much.
That is so. Who could me luckier than me?
Look at this.
They're calling you down for breakfast.
Alright you go. We're coming.
So many gifts. I haven't even opened any. Should I see whats inside?
You got these gifts, you open them and I'll look at you.
What is this? Lets see whats in this? Help me, will you.
You open them, I'll look. In fact I'll do one thing. I'll take your pictures.
No tag.
I think Hamza gave this to you.
I'm sure.
How is it?
It think its very expensive.
Yeah. Its expensive.
I think its much more expensive than the wedding present you gave me.
Really?
Not seriously. I was just kidding.
There is a big difference between Hamza and I.
Hamza is the sky and I.. I have just learnt to fly. I'm just setting up my business.
And Hamza, his business is already established. His business is spread all over the world.
Not only in Pakistan but outside Pakistan as well.
Real estates, pharmacy, import export.
Now he's partnering with us in the food business. Didn't I tell you that,
the Kabeer Foods company that we're launching in Dubai, Hamza is a partner there as well.
Leave everything. I'm not interested in all this. Tell me where are we going for our honeymoon?
Really?
You want to go on a honeymoon as well?
I'm not joking. I'm serious.
Okay. Then you tell me, where do you want to go? Whats your favorite place?
I want to go to Europe. I want to see the whole of Europe with you.
This is a great idea.
Give me your passport in a day or two. I'll apply for our visas.
Really?
Yes. My wife has asked me for something for the first time, I cannot say no. We'll be in Europe in a few days.
My passport is at home but I'll get it. I'm so excited. Thank you so much.
You're most welcome.
You should always stay smiling like this. I want to see you happy. Always.
Open the rest of the gifts.
Hmm..
Please sit.
Thank you very much.
Why did you have to be so formal?
Its nothing formal at all. Like you brought everything with your happiness, we did the same.
How is Nawal?
She's absolutely fine.
You should have brought her along. I would have met her.
I would have brought her along but she was busy.
I don't see Asjad.
He must be on his way. He went out for a while.
Sister Nausheen, that's why I called you earlier so that Asjad could be home but he still left.
Actually Asjad is running a real estate company in partnership with his friend along with his job.
He had a deal and they had to meet their client. He said he'd be back in half an hour. He'll be here soon.
Hello.
Hello.
Asjad what is this? We came to meet you and you're not at home.
Actually I partnered with my friend last month and started a real estate business.
A client messaged and I went to meet him.
I was waiting for you but he called and it was important so I went to meet them.
Did you strike the deal?
Yes thank God. We have the deal.
Thank God.
He has also finalized two more deals, by the grace of God.
Mom, I'm very happy today. Please have something.
Dear, if your real estate business is going so well, why are you working a job?
Exactly. Even I have been thinking. I'll quit if my business is settled.
In fact I want to start an IT business along with it.
You know the future is IT. And there are so many companies in Pakistan investing in IT.
Asjad, all praise to the Lord, you have a very good thinking.
I need your prayers aunty. God will give me the bounties.
You'll be rewarded for your hard work by the grace of God.
Your house is also very beautiful. Isn't it Sultana?
Its the people who make a home. They give life to it.
I cannot see your younger son around.
He's out with his friends.
Alright. When we came over to your house, we weren't formal. Now why are you being formal? Please.
I'm not being formal.
Dear, please serve.
You've been searching for something ever since you came.
I'm going on my honeymoon. That too for a month. Where? Europe.
That's why I'm looking for my passport. I kept it here only.
All praise to the Lord.
I cannot find it. Did you search through my room?
Why would I go through your room?
I'm joking. Why are you upset?
Thank God, I found it. I came for it only.
Good. Now wait for mom before you go. She'll be here in a while.
Kabeer said he'd pick me up on his way back.
He'll send it for visa stamping today only because he said it'll take many days.
Sit for a while. Mom will be happy to meet you. She wanted to meet you yesterday also.
Yes so I'll come back in a few days or call her.
Hello?
Hello Kabeer. I'm free. I found my passport. Come pick me.
Alright. I'll be there in five minutes.
Okay.
Falak wait for a while. I'm getting tea made for you. You're in such a rush. What happened to you?
Nothing. What would happen to me?
I'm watching you. You've changed.
No. Why would I change? I'm still the same. Nothing has changed.
Mom.. You returned so late. Falak was here.
Yes.
Has she left?
Yes.
I did ask her to wait but she was in a rush.
She said she'd be here in a few days. She was here to get her passport.
She's going to Europe for her honeymoon
All praise to the Lord.
Both of you sisters have a good fate.
You'll have loving in laws too, just like Falak.
Do you know? Safdar and I really like Asjad's family. They are very cultured people.
He has his own real estate business as well. I was very excited.
I wanted to say yes but then I thought no. I'd ask you first.
Mom, you should do whatever you think is right. I have no objections.
May God bless you with the best of fates dear. Those people are exactly what I had hoped from God, for you.
They'll keep you very happy, as God wills.
Should I make tea for you?
No. Not now. I'm very tired. I'll rest for a bit and have tea later.
Hello?
No. I've resigned. I'll not rejoin.
Why don't you understand?
Alright. Give me some time to think. I'll tell you then.
How do I look?
Gorgeous. Stunning. Beautiful.
Oh my God. How are you?
I'm fine. Are you going somewhere?
Yes and your aunt are going out for dinner.
I also want to come with you.
Alright. You want to go as well? Fine. Ask mom to get you ready.
But mom isn't home.
Hmm. Then what should we do? By the way you look good in this as well. You look good in everything.
Thank you.
Now lets go. Okay?
Hafsa will go with us?
Yes. She'll go with us.
See how excited she is.
Her mother isn't home. How can we just take her along?
She'll bother us. She's a kid.
Its alright. Hafsa and I often go out together. Sometimes on dinner, sometimes ice cream and sometimes just to hang out.
And without sister Aaliya. Its alright. I'll make her understand. She won't bother.
I'm waiting for you downstairs. Come fast. Don't be late.
I have called Asjad's mother and said yes. 
She wants us to arrange the wedding soon. 
I said we just got one of my daughters married. I cannot marry off another one so soon.
She said if we cannot have the wedding, we can at least have the engagement.
So what did you say?
What could I say? Even I want this. To have an official ceremony.
Alright.
Do one thing. When is Falak going for her honeymoon?
We'll have your engagement ceremony before she leaves.
Alright. I'll ask her and tell you.
Come along.
Lets go.
Lets go.
Kabeer ask Hafsa to sit at the back.
But I've always sat in front with my uncle.
Lets do one thing. We can sit together.
So cute. She even made a place for you. Come sit.
I don't want to go.
Falak? Falak?
Falak wait. Falak? What childish act is this?
This isn't a childish act. We had a plan. Can we not go alone?
Falak, we always go alone.
Hafsa is going with us for the first time. Why are you being so hyper on such small thing?
I have no problems with Hafsa.
But I wanted to spend time with you. I wanted to talk to you and listen to you. This is no way.
So what do you do when we're at home?
What do we do? You're always busy. You have phone calls. Then your friends come over. You have meetings. 
You don't have time for me.
We'll discuss later. Come sit in the car and Hafsa is coming with us. 
We're getting late.
What is Hafsa doing?
She went on dinner with Falak and Kabeer.
What? And you let her go.
I didn't know she was going with them. Nasreen told me.
And you know Kabeer. He has his life in Hafsa.
She must have insisted and he took her along.
They must have wanted to spend some personal time together. Talk to each other.
It was different earlier but she'll bother them now.
Yes but it just skipped my mind.
I told you I didn't know. I just found out.
I'm amazed that you didn't think about it.
Now what can we do? She's gone.
Touqeer. I don't understand this man. Oh God.
See, you know very well I just got Falak married.
It will we very difficult for me to get Nawal married right away. I need time.
Alright then. I have accepted one of your things, now you also accept one of the things I have to say.
Yes?
I want them to sign the marriage document rather than just being engaged.
