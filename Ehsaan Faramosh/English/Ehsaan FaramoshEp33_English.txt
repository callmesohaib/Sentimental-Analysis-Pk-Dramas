Why did you have to order so much? Whose going to eat all this?
Mom, since its my treat, I'll order what I like. As it is, you people eat.
Falak, you know mom and I won't eat that much. All the food will go waste.
I'm happy to order it, please.
No tension about the money.
Take care of the money dear. You'll need them someday.
Mom, I've been offered 3 commercials and Maria is saying all payments will be in advance so no tension about the money.
May God bless you.
Hello Ms. Nawal.
Mr. Shirazi, you?
I had a meeting with a client. I was going back and I saw you.
Will you not introduce us?
Of course. He is Mr. Shirazi, CEO of Shirazi Group and my boss.
Its good to meet you. Nawal praises you often
Even I liked it.
Please come and join us. Tell him please.
Yes, please.
I'm sorry. I'm in a rush or else I'd join you.
No. Please don't say that. Please join us.
Falak?
What is it? It doesn't look good. We'll have lunch together to celebrate the occasion. Come please.
Of course. If I had time, I would have joined you.
As far as Nawal's promotion is concerned, its the fruit of her hard work.
She worked hard for this project and she deserved this promotion. Isn't it Nawal?
Sir, I try to do everything with my heart.
Just keep working like that. Good luck for your future. I'm getting late. See you. Bye.
Falak, why did you have to stop him? He's my boss.
It doesn't look good. What would he think about me?
I was just being courteous. He gave you a promotion and a car. I had to do this.
Nobody can make her understand.
Why are you sitting here? Come sit outside.
Just like that.
Mom and I were in the lounge. Come outside.
Mom was showing me the jewelry she has chosen for Nawal.
Hamza, can I tell you something? You cannot have a relationship based on conditions.
Such relationships are very weak.
I'm feeling helpless even when I know I'm right.
I just cannot explain her what I mean.
Because you're only looking at this matter from one angle.
Try a different perspective.
Maybe she's right and you're wrong.
Sometimes I think that how could such strong relationships end?
Now I understand.
You're being stubborn and egoistic and denying your love. And ego,
Ego eats away at relationships like termite.
One of the two partners have to bend. Only then the relationship will work.
As flexible as the relationship is, its stronger.
Exactly. Please explain this to Nawal.
At least you should understand first, Hamza.
Listen to me. Look at me. Nawal is a great girl.
And you'll not lose her at any cost. Understand?
Now get up.
Hamza's family came over to make Nawal understand.
You should have asked him to make their son understand.
They only wanted to talk.
They wanted to know why I was upset.
Its the same thing. You think Hamza might not have told them anything. Mom, I'm telling you.
Sofia aunty and her daughter knew everything but the thing is how would they find their son is wrong.
That's why they came here to talk to you because you'd agree to everything they say.
They're worried like us.
Mom the boy's side is never worried. The girl's family is always worried.
She already has a broken engagement and if this happens again,
people will start talking. Nobody will say anything to the boy but everybody will say the girl is at fault.
She said she'd talk to Hamza.
You should write it down. Rather than making Hamza understand, she'll come here again and make Nawal resign.
These rich people have no feelings for others.
Nawal, you shouldn't be pressurize. Do whatever you want.
Hamza is educated and yet telling you to call off the wedding. This isn't done.
Falak. Stop it. Nawal is already upset. Don't upset her anymore.
I'm just saying.
Nawal should not back out from what her right is.
You'll see. He'll fall to his feet.
Enough Falak. Nawal get up. Go rest in your room.
Mom, let me talk.
No mom. Falak is right.
I'm not a kid that doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
Hamza misbehaved with me. He's wrong.
Both of you didn't even mention it. You should have told me this.
Some matters will settle with time, peacefully.
Both of you shouldn't worry. Everything will be alright. If God wills.
Falak, go and rest in your room. Its late at night. You shouldn't stay up so long.
Alright. Give it to the manager
Hamza?
Falak, you?
Yes I was passing by. I thought I'd see you.
Will you not ask me to sit?
Oh sorry. Please sit.
How did you find the address of the office?
Actually I called your main office and they said you were here.
I was close by so I thought I'd meet you.
I'm surprised to see you here.
What will you have? Tea or coffee?
No thank you. I was at mom's place so she told me that your family had come yesterday.
Hamza saying no to the wedding, you're being mean to Nawal.
If she isn't listening to you, you should stop being stubborn.
Do you know how much she's hurt with all this?
You're wrong.
Falak its not about her resignation. I'm just tired of trying to explain her.
She doesn't understand that Shirazi is a very clever man and he's using her against me.
You have a misunderstanding. Mr. Shirazi is a very nice, polite man.
In fact I've met him personally and he doesn't seem so.
You, met him personally? When and why?
We were on lunch yesterday. Mom, I, Nawal and him.
But Hamza sorry to say, meeting him didn't give me such vibes.
Nothing at all. In fact he seemed like a gentleman. Very sensible.
You people had lunch with that man?
By the way, who invited him for lunch?
Of course, Nawal.
He is such a nice man. He has done so much.
He promoted Nawal and gave her a double package.
We're not so ungrateful. We could have given him a lunch.
Please don't tell Nawal that I told you everything. She'll be upset with me.
I shouldn't have mentioned this to you.
I don't know how and why I said this. You people are already in a mess. I'm so sorry.
Falak, don't worry
I was here to help you finish all misunderstandings between you and Nawal.
Shirazi or somebody else.
What can I say? I'll just tell you that I love Nawal very much.
I cannot see her get hurt. I'll tell you to please think about it once.
Its not her fault. Please don't treat her this way.
Don't say no to the wedding. What else can I say? Its your decision.
Alright, I'll take your leave now. It was good talking to you.
Bye.
greetings!*
Whats happening?
Nothing..
Falak, why is this bag here?
I had free time so I thought I'd pack. I'm going to mom's.
You're going back? You just came back in the morning?
Whats wrong Kabeer? Its my sister's wedding. Mom needs me.
I just packed a few necessary things.
Okay.
I was at mom's. She told me your family had visited.
You're being mean to Nawal by saying no to the wedding.
If she isn't listening to you, you should listen to her. You know how much this is hurting her?
Mr. Shirazi is a very polite man.
We had lunch together yesterday. Mom, I, Nawal and Mr. Shirazi.
Falak?
Falak?
Falak?
Falak?
Sir, should I get you some tea?
No. Thanks. Where is Falak?
She went outside.
Outside? Alright. You go.
When you read this letter, I would have flown for Dubai.
Please don't mind. Its about my career.
My sister is getting married. Mom would need me. I thought I'd pack a few things. She might need them.
My head is hurting. This boy has put us in so much stress.
It is worrying us, mom. Hamza isn't ready to listen.
If this carries on, this matter will get worse.
And Nawal? Nawal is right. We cannot force her.
But we'll have to do something.
We cannot sit idle. How else will we solve this problem?
Mom..
Can it be done, that you talk to Sultana aunty and postpone the wedding date?
Until Nawal and Hamza sort things out. We cannot have the wedding.
What are you saying? How will I tell them that?
My son isn't in a good mood and I want to cancel the wedding and we'll only have the wedding when he's in a good mood.
It is their humility that they aren't saying anything or else people would have said no.
No. Mom. Don't say that please.
I'm very anxious. I just talked to Raheel. Their tickets would be confirmed in a few days.
What will I tell Raheel and my in laws?
You know mom how much they talk.
If only Hamza cared one bit.
Nazish, you talk to Hamza. Maybe he'll listen to you.
If he continues to be stubborn, the peace of my house will be destroyed.
I tried.
But his silence is worrying me.
I know that even he himself isn't at peace.
What will we do with his worries? We're losing blood here.
If I could, I'd slap him and settle everything.
Whats wrong with you? You had this chance. You should have called him and talked.
I talk? Why?
I'm upset with him. He insulted me. He doesn't even realize.
You go and tell him. I'll not talk. What does he think of himself?
Kabeer? Where is Falak? Call her.
I was thinking we'd go shopping for Nawal's wedding presents since you're home as well.
Aaliya, actually,
Falak isn't home.
Really? She isn't home? Where did she go?
She went to Dubai for two days.
What? Without informing?
All of a sudden? When did she go?
She had a flight at 2pm in the afternoon today.
And you're telling us right now?
Who dropped her at the airport?
She went with the driver.
What? She went with the driver and you let her go? What do you do Kabeer?
You know her condition doesn't allow her to go.
I know but what could I do? She was insisting. She had a plan with her friends.
I was forced to let her go. I was scared what if she got sick again.
Kabeer I don't understand what you're doing.
If she's stupid, you're sensible.
Touqeer is right. Friends outing plan could have been postponed.
Kabeer, you should take responsibility. I must say this.
If Falak doesn't care for herself and her unborn child,
then you should have been careful. You should have tried to stop her.
If you couldn't you should have asked me. I would have talked to her.
You don't know. I have to say again. She needs care in this condition.
Whats done is done. We cannot change anything.
I've tried to explain her to be careful.
And if you want to go to shop for gifts, I'll go with you.
No its okay. Let Falak be back, we'll go with her. There's no rush.
I'm going out for a while. Fresh air.
Yes, sure.
What happened?
I don't know. Weird. They're not kids.
Nawal? Come. Lets have dinner together. I made your favorite dishes.
Mom, I'm not hungry. Please eat.
Dear,
How long will you stay like this? You didn't even eat anything for lunch.
I know when you're worried, you don't get hungry but you cannot live on an empty stomach.
Mom, my head hurts. Let me rest. If you're hungry, please eat. I'll eat when I'm hungry.
Alright fine. But do eat, please.
Hello? Hie, how are you?
Actually I wanted to discuss something important with you.
But if Kabeer has no objections, what can we do?
Aaliya, at least we should talk.
Toqueer please.
You will not talk to Kabeer. He seemed very upset. God knows what the two of them discussed. 
We don't know what Falak told him to make him agree.
Now if you talk to him, he'll be more upset. 
Its their life. They can do whatever they want. Our interference isn't feasible.
Of all people, you're saying this.
Yes. I am. I don't want them to have an argument because of us.
We already have so many problems. I don't want anything anymore. Let everything be as it is
But Aaliya..
Leave it. Finish it here.
 I was in a mood for coffee. Do you want some?
Obviously. Please.
Please go and make some. Thanks.
Hello?
Kabeer I know you're upset with me but please talk to me. 
I've been calling you. You're not answering.
If you cared about me being upset. Why would you go?
Then you tell me what should I do?
I get bored in home all day. I have nothing to do and you people are insisting I leave this as well.
Its only for 2 days. I'll be back in two days after the shoot. 
Please don't be angry.
Falak I told you not to get the shoot done.
I can tolerate everything but not this.
Kabeer whats wrong with you? I called you to have a good chat and,
now you're repeating everything.
I'm getting you a flight right now. You're coming back on the next flight.
Do you have idea how much embarrassed I was in front of Aaliya and Toqueer?
 Its the first time in life I had to lie to them because of you.
What did you lie about?
That I had allowed you myself.
You could have told them the truth.
What should have I told them? That you've become bold enough to go without my permission.
No more doing as you please. You'll have to listen to me. No more shoots. 
You're coming back on the next flight.
But Kabeer.
Alright, fine. I'll not shoot if you say. But let me stay here for two days. 
I'm happy here. I like it. God knows when I'll get the chance again.
Alright. Stay if you want to but you'll not do the shoot.
Alright I won't. Trust your Falak. Don't you trust me this much?
I told you to come with me. It would have been great if you'd be here. We could have enjoyed.
If you wanted me to be with you, you wouldn't have gone.
Oh well. I have a headache. I'm going to bed. Bye.
He cannot see me happy.
Kabeer did you talk to Falak? How is she?
I did. She's fine.
See Toqueer is very upset.
Falak went away like this but I tried to make him understand. 
If he says something to you, please don't mind. He's very angry.
No. What are you saying? Why will I mind what he says?
Once Falak is back, make her understand. I hope she'll understand.
Don't worry. I'll make her understand. She won't do this again.
Alright. Where are you going?
I have some work.
Alright, I have some work too. See you later.
Hamza? Does it really not make a difference if you don't marry Nawal?
It does make a difference. Why won't it? Why are you asking?
Because I've never seen anyone as peaceful as you if they're losing their love.
I met Nawal.
 I saw her worried and tears in her eyes.
I think I don't know how to express my emotions so well.
Sultana aunty came today. She was worried.
She had tears in her eyes. She's the mother of a daughter and she can see,
she will have to answer a hundred people if you call off the wedding. 
She'll have to testify there's no fault with her daughter. 
She said,
nobody will ask you or say anything to you. 
She was right. We're the groom's side.
Nobody will dare point a finger at us. 
Everybody will always blame the girl's family.
That's why you're relaxed.
But why are you telling me all this?
So that you realize it as well.
 Mom is worried because of you. She's very hurt, Hamza.
Calling off the wedding isn't a small thing. 
It will ridicule two families. Why don't you understand this?
Try to understand this
.
I'm not calling off the wedding. Why doesn't anybody ask Nawal? I'm her husband to be.
If I'm saying something, she should listen to me. Why is she being stubborn? 
Her attitude shows her office is more important for her, than me.
Hamza, I'm not here to argue. I just want to say, please don't put mom through a test.
Okay fine. Now tell me what to do?
Meet Nawal and sit together to sort it out, Hamza. 
Your attitude is hurting everyone, Hamza.
Nawal? Should I tell you something?
 Listen to Hamza.
You're asking me to listen to him?
Yes dear. 
What we think is the purpose of our life.. 
success, job, money, we find all this in our life someday.
If you don't find, you don't find true love. 
There is a replacement for everything, my dear. But not human beings.
But Hamza should realize this.
 He should know what makes me happy, what I like or dislike.
If he isn't backing down, then you should. 
After all, its the woman who has to agree in the end.
 Or put it that way. To save your relationships,
one of the two parties has to sacrifice
 and God has made woman more flexible than men.
Mom, I'm missing dad a lot today.
Congratulations everyone.
Congratulations to you as well.
Mr. Shirazi, congratulations!
thank you.
Mr. Shirazi, lunch is ready for you.
Why did you have to be so formal?
We're partners now. We'll keep on treating you with this formality.
 Please. Will you join us Aaliya?
Farhan?
Yes mam?
I want all these pictures on social media right away.
 I want everyone to know that there's a deal between Kabeer Foods and Shirazi and Co.
Okay. Yes mam.
Please forward these.
Call Mr. Kabeer and tell him we have a meeting at 5pm today. And listen. No excuses.
Such urgent meeting? Is everything alright?
Come sit.
I saw a few pictures of you with Shirazi and Group.
 I don't believe you could do this.
What do you mean?
We're partners and you signed a deal with them without asking me.
You didn't even ask me or better yet, tell me.
Hamza this was Aaliya's decision.
She wanted to not disclose the deal until it was finalized.
Alright.
Cancel it.
What? Hamza you know very well, I cannot do this. I need this deal.
Alright. If you don't cancel this deal, we cannot be friends anymore.
And neither our partnership. I'm canceling our deal.
What are you saying Hamza? You cannot do this.
Do you even realize how much loss we'll incur.
I know. That's why I have thought this decision through
Hamza, you're my friend. If not for your business, then for our friendship at least. 
We've invested millions, Hamza.
If we back down from this project, and that too at this hour. 
Please Hamza, I request you. 
If you have a problem with terms and conditions, we can sit and talk.
But please, let the project run, don't stop it. We'll incur a big loss.
I have no problem with the terms or conditions. I just have a problem with Shirazi.
If you want our deal and our friendship to stay, call off the deal with Shirazi.
Hamza try to understand. We're helpless without the deal with Shirazi.
I've told you my condition. Its up to you now. 
If you will keep the deal with Shirazi, I cannot work with you. 
This is my final decision.
