This girl cannot be my daughter in law.
Hamza I'm ordering you to divorce this girl right now.
Are you feeling better now?
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
If you're not okay, should I call the doctor?
I'm fine.
See Falak, you knew how would mom react.
She's not happy with our wedding.
She will not accept our marriage, so fast.
I had an idea but I didn't know she'd react so severely.
Alright. She could have been angry or scolded us.
I would have listened to everything but this threat to throw me out of the house,
we got married Hamza, we've not sinned.
I'm sorry for mom's reaction.
She was very harsh.
She shouldn't have done that.
But the fact is, you'll have to tolerate her taunts for a little while.
She will have to bear her strict behavior
and I believe the way you've made a place in my life,
you'll make a place in my mom's and sister's life as well.
Yes but, I'm scared Hamza.
Her behavior has scared me. This seems very difficult. How will I do everything Hamza?
Time will fix everything.
She is just angry that's why she's behaving like this.
You'll see, she'll be fine in a few days.
I hope to God this happens.
Everything happened so fast that I couldn't think of having the room decorated.
Whats are you saying?
You're in my life now. Everything else is meaningless.
I'm a part of your life, its enough for me.
Thank you.
I will not tolerate this girl in my house at all.
This matter will not be solved like this, mom. Didn't you see mutiny in Hamza's eyes?
This is all because of this girl. She poisoned Hamza's mind.
Hamza has never talked to me like this.
I'm telling you, if Hamza doesn't divorce her, I'll throw Hamza and her out of the house immediately.
I don't care what they do but this girl cannot live in my house. I don't give a damn.
No mom. What are you saying?
Will you throw your only son out for this girl?
You'll not do this. We'll handle this matter in another way.
What should I do? I cannot tolerate it.
I want to strangle that girl right now. God knows what she fed my son.
My son has always been obedient.
He has always listened to what I said, today..
he took such a big decision in his life without asking and without informing.
This means, he didn't respect or gave his mother any importance. This is unimaginable.
Mom, even I don't believe this.
Please be strong. Everything will be alright.
You've still kept all these things safe?
These things are very important for me.
They remind me of you.
You shouldn't be so surprised.
I'm just showing you these so that you believe me that I'll never stop loving you.
See, I got what I wanted. I told you I'd not accept defeat. I've married him.
You're my only sister. I thought I'd tell you.
Will you not congratulate me?
Its the same thing. Do you think Hamza didn't tell them anything?
Mom I'm 100% sure, Sofia aunty and her daughter knew everything.
Its the same thing. How would they see their son's fault? How would they hold him accountable?
That's why they came to you because you'd agree to everything and listen to them.
We're getting married and you will be resigning in a month.
Do it now. I won't let you work once we're married.
If you still want to work, join my office.
I've never seen an egoistic man like Hamza ever.
Do you know Nawal, all these men are the same?
They think a woman is weak.
Had I been in your place, I'd have said no clearly.
Don't worry, you're not alone. Mom and I are with you.
You'll have to decide. We will only get married if you resign from your job.
If you won't resign, I'll not marry you.
Strawberry jam.. Here..
Hello. Good morning.
Hello. Wait.
She cannot sit here.
Send her food to her room.
What are you saying? There's no use of saying this.
Falak is my wife. She's a part of this house.
And she will sit here with us.
She might be your wife but she isn't a part of this family or this house.
If you clearly explain it to her, it would be best.
Also she shouldn't be coming face to face with me. For the best.
What are you thinking? Are you mad?
Please, ignore her harsh attitude for a few days.
I understand Hamza but I'm a human being as well.
I get hurt with this attitude. Whats my fault?
And make her understand that we got married. We're not sinning.
Our religion allows us to get married and live as we like.
Don't cry please. Look at me.
You don't have to worry much.
It'll take some time but everything will be alright then.
Okay?
Yes?
Sir I needed Ms. Nawal's signature on this file.
I've been calling her but she isn't receiving. What should I do?
Keep this here. I'll see. Thank you.
Kabeer? My friend.. Did you hear something?
What?
Hamza is married now.
And that too with your ex-wife, Falak.
Who told you this?
The entire society knows. You're the only one who doesn't know.
I don't care what they do or what they don't.
Its good.
Tell me, we have a meeting with Rafay. When will we leave?
Yes. Is it possible that you attend the meeting yourself? Actually I'm not feeling well.
I want to go home and get some rest.
Okay. No worries. You go home and rest.
And I'll update you whatever happens.
Thank you. See you.
Okay
Falak? Come, you haven't eaten anything since morning.
Hamza, I'm not eating anything. You eat.
Why don't you want to eat? Will you stay hungry like this? Come on. Come with me.
Hamza... Didn't you see what aunty did? If I come with you, she'll scold me more.
This was our first breakfast after we got married.
She taunted me so much.
She could have been quiet for the sake of her son's happiness, if not mine.
I told you earlier as well. It'll take some time and then everything will be alright.
But what if they create differences between us until then?
If you get pressurized by your family and divorce me.. I'll be, once more..
What are you saying?
Why are you even thinking that?
Why do you even think that? Throw these thoughts out.
Hamza I was going through a very tough time in my life when you came along.
Its your encouragement that allowed me to get stable.
God forbid if we part ways now.
If you leave me, what will I do? How will I live?
What are you saying?
Trust me. I'm with you and I'll always be with you.
I promise.
I miss mom very much.
Had she been with me, this wouldn't have happened.
Is this the way to treat a new bride?
Everybody treats a new bride with love and respect and here..
I was threatened to be thrown out and insulted on the breakfast table.
I know...
Falak, I'll do one thing. We'll have lunch outside. Okay? Just you & me
No Hamza, I'm telling you. I've heard enough, now I'm not hungry.
I'll not take no for an answer.
Get ready in 10 minutes. Don't change. Your dress is beautiful
I'll go freshen up.
Mr. Kabeer? You? Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine as well. Is Nawal home?
Yes she's home. She's in her room. She isn't well.
Please come in. I'll call her.
Please sit here. I'll call her.
Thank you.
Nawal mam? Mr. Kabeer is here. Nawal mam?
Mam? Nawal mam? What happened?
Mr. Kabeer..
What happened?
Nawal mam is unconscious?
Unconscious? Where is she?
She's in her room. Please come.
Nawal?
Nawal? Nawal.. She has high fever.
Get some water. I'll call an ambulance.
Doctor, how is she now?
She's better than before. She fainted because of the fever and weakness.
Is she conscious now?
She's conscious. We're shifting her in a room. Then you can meet her.
Okay. Thank you.
Hello.
Naveen, dear, go to your room.
You're my uncle's bride?
Of course.
Naveen dear, good girl. Go to your room.
I thought you'd never come to me so I came to you.
Someone has to bridge the distance so I thought I'd take the first step.
I talked to Aaliya some time ago and she told me a lot about you.
First I was surprised and didn't believe her.
But I do know that Aaliya cannot lie.
She told me how you trapped Kabeer and took advantage of him.
And how you created problems for him and his family.
Kabeer was sensible that he didn't listen to you.
Now you'll do the same here because people never lets go of their habits.
I respect you a lot but if you disrespect me,
don't expect me to insult you.
I think Aaliya didn't tell you the many things I can do.
See Falak, I'm warning you.
You might have entered the house after marrying Hamza, but none of your moves will make a difference here.
How are you feeling now?
You brought me to the hospital?
Actually I was calling you all day but you didn't answer.
We needed your signature on an important document so I came myself.
Its good that I came.
I'm sorry. I bothered you a lot.
Nawal please don't be formal. You didn't bother me at all.
In fact I'm happy I could be of use.
I have a complaint..
You were so unwell and you didn't even tell me. You didn't even call.
I thought I was very strong and I'd not die so easily but see,
I survived this.
Should I tell you something?
Someone who didn't be yours after so much love and loyalty,
trust me, he can never be anybody's.
Whether it is Falak or Hamza, both of them are selfish and apathetic.
Both of them have hurt a lot of people. They'll not be happy.
You'll see. Time will decide and when time decides, it doesn't need witnesses.
Excuse me,
this is her diet plan. She is very weak. Please follow this.
Thank you doctor.
Kabir, I've wasted a lot of your time.
you should go home. Ilham must be alone. You need to take care of her.
Don't be formal. If I leave, who'll stay with you?
I'll call my maid, she'll stay with me.
No. Don't bother her.
I'll stay with you. And Ilham's nanny is with her. I just talked.
She had her milk and she slept.
But Kabeer, I've already bothered you.
This isn't bothering me. In fact I'm doing this happily. Relax.
Hamza what have you thought, then?
About what?
A reception for our wedding.
I want you to publicly announce our wedding.
And we'll have a big reception to announce this so that everybody knows about our wedding.
I'll have a reception.
But not yet. I have a lot of work. I don't have time.
We'll think about it later.
We'll have to tell everyone.
I know the circumstances we got married in, we couldn't tell anyone or invite them.
This is a good chance. We'll tell everyone and I'll invite them.
And you know I'll invite the most famous photographer in our reception. He'll take the best pictures of us.
So that I can show Kabeer and Nawal that we're happy together.
How many times have I told you to not take their names in front of me?
I'm sorry. I'll not do it again. But still I want them to realize.
That they've lost so much. Especially Nawal. She should realize what she lost in you.
Please Hamza don't say no. Listen to me.
As it is, Nawal told me the day we got married that I'll never be happy.
But I want to show them how happy I am and how much you care for me.
Alright. If you wish, I'll do it.
I knew it. You'd never say no to me. You've honored me.
I'll go and change.
I don't believe this.
I was shocked after hearing the news.
I'm surprised. Its unbelievable.
Hamza left Nawal for a girl like Falak?
Oh my God. And look at Falak?
She destroyed her own sister's house.
You know her instincts very well.
Nothing is important to her. She only holds her own benefit dear and for that she can do anything.
She can go to any limits. In fact she can sacrifice anyone.
Yes but, Hamza..
Falak is like that but Hamza could be so stupid?
Once you're blindfolded by mistrust, you become blind literally.
Yes. You're right.
Mistrust is a disease the eats away the most beautiful of relationships.
Tell me how is Nawal now?
She's very depressed.
Kabeer, make her understand that,
we should be thankful if we lose careless people from our life.
We don't need to make her understand.
She got hurt so deeply that she'll understand herself.
Talk to Toqueer please. Kabeer..
Dad was saying that Falak's parents are dead. They're with God now.
Yes, dear.
And that's why Falak will live with us. Will you keep her in your room?
Falak makes so much of noise. I'll not keep her in my room.
If you don't keep her with you, she'll have to go to the orphan house.
You've always wanted a younger sister and now Falak can be your younger sister.
Sultana are you mad? You're worried for a servant's daughter? You've given her a car,
She isn't a servant's daughter. She's my daughter.
 I don't like it when you say that.
Its different to bring someone up and to call them your own daughter.
I've brought her up and I think of her as my own daughter.
What does you thinking of her as your daughter do? Your own blood is your own only.
Mam Nawal?
Yes?
Are you okay?
Yes I'm better than before.
I've brought soup for you.
Keep it here, I'll have it later.
I know you'll not have it later. You're not taking care of yourself at all.
Why are you worried? I'm fine.
Can I tell you something mam? Whatever is hurting you,
cry upon it once, you'll be at peace.
 Mr. Hamza was your fiance.
We had a boy in our village. He divorced his wife to marry her sister. 
That girl didn't even think once.
She destroyed her sister's house. 
I've not seen an ungrateful woman like Falak, ever.
You and mam did so much for her. 
You took care of her more than your own self and see what she did with you.
We made a mistake to recognize her.
God is watching. Don't worry. You'll be rewarded for your patience.
Please have this soup now.
Keep it here, I'll have it later.
Please do or else you'll not get better.
There should be no changes. 
I've already told you about the colors and theme.
I'll tell you if there's something else. Okay. Bye.
Who were you talking to?
I want to host a grand reception dinner for my wedding. That's what I'm talking about.
Have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind?
Why? What happened?
What happened? 
Do you even realize what people are saying about us? We're being insulted.
Mom, please.
I've told you earlier, this doesn't bother me. 
People talk and they will. I cannot let them govern my life.
It might not make a difference to you but it does make a difference to me and your sister.
I didn't realize you'll be so stupid. 
You throw a party to celebrate your wedding when your family is happy. 
You married that girl secretively.
Mom please. You have no right to talk about Falak like this.
She respects you very much. 
If you cannot give her the value she deserves, don't. 
But I won't let you insult her like this.
Dear I don't have to insult her. 
A girl who secretively marries someone, is insulted herself. 
Please have some shame. If she doesn't, you should.
She married her sister's fiance. Please for God's sake.
Mom is right, Hamza.
You don't have to hold a reception 
and if you really want to hold a reception, invite a few friends for dinner.
That would be enough.
Just call the event manager and cancel everything.
You've insulted us enough already. I will not tolerate more. 
There will be no party in this house. That's it.
Yes Zakiya?
 Oh Kabeer, its you..
I was passing by, I thought I'd make her meet you.
You did good. I was feeling anxious as it is.
You should have called me, I would have brought her to meet you.
No, I've already bothered you a lot.
Its okay. No problem.
How are you feeling now?
She's here now. I'll be fine. Should I make a feeder for her? Come along.
Lets go.
I'm so upset. 
The NGO meeting I went for, everybody was talking about Hamza's marriage there. 
They had watched Falak's press conference.
They were surprised how Hamza could marry such a girl.
I was so embarrassed.
 I couldn't see people in the eye. This boy has gotten us insulted. I couldn't see people in the eye.
Mom, why are you embarrassed?
 Those who should be embarrassed, are happy in their lives.
They're hanging out and enjoying.
I feel he isn't thinking before taking any decisions. 
This boy has lost his mind.
I had so many plans for him. I had so many dreams for my son.
He destroyed everything, his life. What will I do about this boy now?
You're the limit Hamza.
 Aunty was talking as if we have committed a big sin.
And you.. you should have said something to her. You just said yes to whatever she said.
Do you think I didn't say anything to her?
Falak she's the elder of our house and we married without her consent. She's upset with us.
That's what I want to tell you Hamza. This is her problem.
She never agreed for the wedding and I think she wants this marriage to end 
so that she can get you married to Nawal.
I have made no requests to you.
 I just want, that you announce our marriage publicly? 
What wrong am I saying? Its my right.
Mom isn't agreeing.
What if I arrange a party and there's a problem?
 We will all get insulted in front of the guests.
Let this matter cool down and mom accept us. We'll plan this then.
 Just postpone it until then.
I have no worth in your eyes.
If aunty wants you to leave me, will you divorce me?
What are you saying? This won't happen.
I cannot tell you the hell of a life I've lived before. 
Kabeer did so much to me.
I was never happy in that house and now when I'm happy and I want to show the world, whats the objection in that?
First there was Aaliya in that house. Everything was done according to her wish. I had no worth.
I was insulted every time. And here, you have aunty. 
I have no value. Alright, if she wants to cancel, do it. I'll be happy with whatever she wants.
Why are you losing all hope, Falak?
Why not Hamza? I thought you were different than Kabeer.
You will say whats right. 
You'll have separate values for everybody at home.
You will be able to give people their rights to express what they want but I was wrong.
Mom has a problem holding a reception at home.
 I'll find a venue.
So I think she'll not object.
