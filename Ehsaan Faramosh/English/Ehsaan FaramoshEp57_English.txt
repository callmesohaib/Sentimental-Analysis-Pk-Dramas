You look good.
You too.
Nawal I know you're not happy with this marriage.
You didn't want to marry me.
But the circumstances made you do it.
But I want you trust me.
I'll never burden you more than needed.
You're right.
I didn't want to marry you.
But not because of you or Ilham.
I felt how would I face people
but after everybody made me understand, I thought why should I let others govern my life.
Why should I give them so much importance? Its my life and I'll live it like I want too.
Some times God decides for us
and we don't think they're right. We're unhappy with those decisions.
But then time makes us realize that God plans for the best.
I did not marry you because someone told me to or pressurized me.
I married you with all my senses
and I'll take care of all my responsibilities, happy. Whether you tell me or not.
I'm glad that you're in my life.
Hello?
Falak. I've been calling you since long. Why didn't you answer?
Listen to me. I was getting ready. Hamza and I are going for lunch and then shopping.
You tell me how are you, hows everything?
Did you get the news?
What news?
You really don't know what happened?
Will you tell me or just create suspense?
Nawal and Kabeer got married.
What? Are you mad? What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
I'm in my senses and I'm telling the truth.
Nawal and Kabeer are married?
How is it possible?
How can they get married?
See..
I told you what I knew. You see what you want to do.
I was scared this would happen.
Falak, lets go?
What happened? Why do you look worried?
Hamza..
What happened?
Nawal and Kabeer got married.
What?
Didn't I tell you they liked each other?
Nobody believed us. God knows since when they had their affair and kept fooling us.
Why are you so angry? What happened Hamza?
What would Hamza say? I'll tell you. You taunted me so much.
You didn't believe me. My own sister destroyed my house. Nawal, did.
Now I understand that she turned Kabeer against me.
God knows what she would tell him. She destroyed my life.
What does all this mean now?
Nawal and Kabeer are married now.
What? Are you shocked now?
You people didn't believe me when I told you.
Instead you called me characterless and accused me.
Did you see now? You were like if Nawal had cast a spell on you. You wouldn't hear a thing.
So? Why are you so upset now?
What difference does it make to you no matter who Nawal marries?
Why would it not make a difference to me?
She accused my character. I was deemed the liar. I can talk and I will talk. Nobody can stop me.
See Falak, they can do whatever they want.
It doesn't make a difference to me and it shouldn't to you as well.
Exactly. That's my point. I'm saying the same thing.
No matter what Nawal and Kabeer do in their life, it shouldn't be your concern.
But Hamza when I told everyone, nobody trusted me.
Aunty you used to say.. you swore on Nawal's innocence.
What happened now? Why did they get married?
Falak listen to me.
After today we will not discuss this topic..
But Hamza..
Stop it Falak. I told you. Enough!
Strange. God knows what mess their family is.
God knows.
What did you think, I'd never find out?
I didn't get married secretively that you wouldn't know.
You must be very happy. You got what you wanted.
Happiness is temporary but I'm at peace
because I didn't deny anybody's rights or turned someone against anyone.
I didn't lie to anyone and I didn't marry because I was greedy.
Really? If you aren't greedy why did you marry Kabeer?
You screamed and told everyone there was nothing between you and Kabeer. So how did you get married now?
Think of it as fate brought us together.
As it is this shouldn't bother you because you cannot hear the truth
and I do not tell lies so let it be.
I left Kabeer. Think of it like this.
You never thought he deserved you.
So what did you do? Someone I thought was not worth me, you married him?
So you should be happy. I married someone you left.
Nawal, I know Kabeer more than you.
I know you'll never be happy with him. He will never keep you happy.
Remember what I told you.
So after claiming what belongs to others you have now started telling horoscopes as well. Wow.
You have left Kabeer so whether I'm happy or not, its my fate.
It shouldn't bother you Falak.
Nazish what new story is now opening in our lives.
I am thinking whether I made a mistake in understanding Nawal
Mom are you trusting what Falak said?
She's right. If they did not have an affair, why would they get married?
Its not like this mom. I think Nawal's decision is right.
She can marry whoever she wants.
And if she married Kabeer, where is it written that she had an affair with Kabeer.
No mom.
I think there is something that has happened, that's why they took this decision.
By the way mom, you should ask Aaliya. She'll tell you the truth.
Yes. I'll ask Aaliya. Good idea.
Nawal I like this one.
Really?
If you like it, we'll get it.
I'll get what you like before we get married then after that I'll get what I like.
If you're wearing them for me, I should be choosing them.
Tell me.
So what about what I like?
I'm the one you like.
She spent all day with Kabeer. First they were scared of Aaliya but not anymore.
They'll spend the days and nights together now.
Didn't I tell you? They liked each other but nobody believed me.
God knows since when they had their affair.
Hamza? Where were you? I've been calling you since long. Why didn't you answer?
Why? What happened? I'm here.
What happened? Do you know how worried I was? Where were you?
Don't disturb me with such useless questions.
I made your breakfast myself.
Why? Were are the servants?
I just wanted to so I made it.
But you don't have to do this. We have servants for all this.
Hamza you're my husband. I like doing your work.
Okay.
Hamza, have your breakfast and then we'll spend the entire day together.
We'll go to a good place and hang out.
I'm sorry Falak but I have back to back meetings today. I'll not get time.
Hamza, I'm very upset and I know you're upset as well.
That's why I thought we should go away somewhere. Away from all these tensions.
Lets go out of town. Far away.
No. I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.
If you want to go, you can go with the driver. Or call your friend and go for an outing.
Don't wait up for me.
I'll get tea made.
Please..
Oh, where is Ilham?
She just slept.
Really?
She was playing with Nawal. She slept in her lap while playing.
Alright. Sit. I want to talk.
Aaliya, is everything alright?
Yes everything is alright. Its just Aaliya and I are going back tomorrow.
So soon?
Why are you going back so soon? You just got here. Stay for a few days.
Kabeer the work load is immense.
My partner called and said he couldn't handle the work. The company is new. I'll have to go.
Whatever Aaliya and I came for, its done. You and Nawal are married now.
All praise to God.
Now Aaliya and I have no worries about Ilham, that's why we're leaving.
But Aaliya, you should have stayed for a few days.
You should come to meet us in Germany. We'll hang out and enjoy together.
As God wills. Well, have a safe flight. I think we should plan a good dinner tonight.
Hello?
Sara and I have a plan for dinner. If you want I'll come pick you.
I don't want to go. You two should go.
Why? What happened?
I don't know, I'm very angry. I don't want to do anything.
I want to burn everything down.
So you're worried about Kabeer and Nawal.
Of course. I don't understand how its possible.
They didn't even like each other and they didn't even have an affair.
How can they get married now?
Do you remember?
You misbehaved with them in the hotel.
So what else would I have done? She created a scene at my reception.
She threw the gift pack on Hamza. We were so embarrassed.
After what happened with her, she deserved it.
Maybe after she was so embarrassed, they decided to get married to shut people up.
I created differences between Hamza and Nawal after so much trouble.
I showed him that Nawal and Kabeer had something going on.
But it was only to turn him against her. I didn't know they'd get married in real.
How is it possible? I'm so angry.
I will not let them be in peace. I'll make their lives hell. How could they get married?
Should I give you a suggestion Falak? You wanted Hamza and now you have him.
Now you shouldn't bother about Nawal and Kabeer.
Let them be. You'll be at peace this way.
Not at all.
What happened? Why are you looking at me like this?
So you played this game.
Mom and I were right about you. You turned Hamza against Nawal.
What do you mean? What are you saying? What game?
Don't be so innocent. I heard everything.
Falak, aren't you ashamed? You destroyed your sister's house to get what you wanted.
They did you such big favors and you returned their favors like this?
What are you saying? I don't understand.
You will now understand. Let Hamza come today.
You will do no such thing. Remember this.
I'm warning you if you talk to me in this tone, again.
You ungrateful woman!
Mom is right about you. You can never be someone's.
Yes. I can never be. I will never. Now? What can you do?
Let Hamza come today. I'll tell him everything.
His eyes should be opened about the girl he now claims to love. He should know,
what his wife is up to!
You can do nothing.
You and I both are here. We'll see.
Mom look at how she dared to threaten me.
If I tell everything to Hamza, it'll be bad.
I told you mom, Nawal and Kabeer had nothing going on. It is all Falak's doing.
She trapped Hamza and see now, she trapped Hamza so successfully.
And he's so stupid, he believed her.
What happened? Is everything alright? You look worried.
Didn't I tell you Falak trapped you with a proper plan? Didn't I?
You told me this earlier as well.
Yes but today we heard Falak say all this herself.
Did Falak tell you everything herself?
She didn't tell us. She was talking to her friend on the phone and we heard.
Nazish.. this is all a lie. I didn't say anything.. Hamza, I didn't..
Falak..
You know aunty and Nazish don't like me since day one.
They just want me out of this house. Nazish threatened me in the morning
that she would get you to insult me and throw me out. And now she's lying.
She's lying. Falak aren't you ashamed of lying?
I heard everything myself.
I'm not lying. You are.
Why don't you to ask me to leave directly?
Hamza I don't want to live here, please listen to them.
I can live without you but I cannot live with this insult everyday.
I feel suffocated. I get insulted all the time.
You're not going anywhere, Falak.
Promise me, that you'll give Falak the respect she deserves.
And if that doesn't happen, then..
Then?
Then what?
I'll take Falak and leave.
Mom.. Are you alright?
Mom..
Everything will be alright Falak. Don't worry.
How can I not worry? Hamza nothing will be alright.
As long as Nazish is in this house, nothing will be okay.
She keeps instigating aunty against me all day.
I know once she leaves aunty and I will be okay.
Ask Nazish to go back to her house.
Falak this isn't possible. She has the same right on this house like I.
Alright. She can stay here. Get me another house and we'll shift there.
That's not possible either.
I cannot leave my mom and sister. They're my responsibility.
I will never leave my responsibility. I'll never do this.
I don't have so much guts.
And you don't have my responsibility? The pain I'm going through. 
My life has become a big mess. Its so difficult, you don't even realize.
Aunty doesn't want to accept you. I'm telling you, she'll never accept me. 
How long have we been married for? Months now. 
Nothing will be alright, Hamza.
I'm telling you Falak..
Everything will be fine. Just give it some time.
Why isn't Hamza listening to me? I think I'll have to do something.
Yes so newly weds? Whats your plan for your honeymoon?
We have no plans for honeymoon, yet.
I'm saying come to Germany with us.
 The place is nice, the weather is superb. I'm sure you'll like it.
Oh, ask Nawal where she wants to go. Germany or somewhere else?
Nawal tell me. Where do you want to go?
Actually Aaliya we have not thought about it and I don't think,
we can go somewhere right now. Our business isn't so stable right now. 
Let the business get stable and then we'll think about it.
Actually Nawal is right. Let the business get stable and then we'll definitely go, if God wills.
If God wills, everything will be alright soon. 
Amen
Nawal you'll have to take care of Kabeer and Ilham.
Of course.
Kabeer, you will take care of Nawal. If I get even a little complain, I'll scold you.
Aaliya..
Now its time for our flight. Go and get Hafsa. Where is she?
Where will she be? She'll be with Ilham. I'll call her.
You must be very expert in this.
After your husband passed away, you want to keep yourself busy.
 That's why you do this
You mind your own business.
What I do and what I don't, don't worry about it?
If I tell you the same thing to mind your own business, then?
If you want to live in this house, live peacefully. 
Otherwise you saw what happened last night? Do you want me to get you thrown out?
How dare you talk to me, like that?
What do you think of yourself?
What I am and what I'm worth, let it be. What are you worth in this house?
You're a widow, without any support.
 You're sitting in your brother's house.
My worth.. Ask your husband what I'm worth.
If I take my share out of this house and this business, he'll be on the road.
What do you want to say? What do you mean?
If you talk to me in this way again. It'll be for the worst.
Hamza, how much share does Nazish have in this business and the house?
What? What sort of a question is this?
Answer me what I'm asking you. How much share does she have?
But why are you asking this? What interest do you have?
Do you know what she said to me? 
She said if I withdrew her share from the business and this house, you'd be on the road.
Did she say this?
Of course. She keeps taunting me. She's always showing me down.
She asked me what I was worth? Now you get up and tell her what I'm worth. I'm your wife.
Tell me one thing. Why did you have to talk to her on this topic?
What do you mean?
I made you understand. She's my elder sister and she's my responsibility.
Don't argue with her.
I don't argue. She comes and taunts me. She's always saying useless things.
Okay fine. I'll talk to her and tell her to not argue with you.
But please you also take care. Okay?
