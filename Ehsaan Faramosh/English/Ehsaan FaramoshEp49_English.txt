Falak, are you asking me to leave this house?
Yes... it's better for you.
Because it will be very hard for you to live here until you transfer that land to me.
He's not a director or a producer. He has taken money from so many people.
If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have endured this loss.
This all happened because of you.
You looked at me enviously and now all of it is ruined.
Did you sign an agreement with him?
No, the papers were being prepared.
You gave him such a huge sum without an agreement?
Maria is all of our friend.
It never occurred to us that she could commit fraud.
One can't trust one's family nowadays...
and you trusted your friend, someone you just befriended a few months ago.
That's what I'm saying.
How can you trust someone so blindly?
I would have understood if it was a sum like ten lacs, but this is four crores...
You chose to give him the money... you don't have proof or any witnesses, how can we catch him like this?
Does this concern blackmail?
No, it's nothing like that.
Maria wanted me to meet Shuja.
As soon as we met, he talked about a serial. They wanted to cast me in a serial.
We couldn't agree so we decided to produce a film.
He wanted to cast me as a lead. I thought that it would be a good investment.
How could I've known that they would steal my money?
People like that are very professional.
They target foolish and emotional people. People who can fall victim to their words easily.
Such seems to be your case.
We can't change what happened, now tell me...
Can we do something about this?
It's very hard, but I'll try my best.
Please... because she is very worried.
I'll try my best,
Falak, control yourself.
My entire life's work has been stolen.
Do you know how worried I am?
On top of that sister Niwal has made my life hell by taunting me.
I realize that you need not worry.
It's four crore rupees, it might be nothing to you, but to me it's a large amount.
Tell me, did you file a report with the police?
I have, but it will make no difference.
They said that I chose to give them the money.
That's why they can't prove it...
that I was a victim of a fraud.
I'll do something about it. I'll talk to somebody.
What will you do?
I have a few friends in the police...
I'll talk to them, let's see what we can do.
I'm so troubled. Sister Niwal has told me...
that I should leave home. Where will I go?
I didn't expect Niwal to behave this way.
Stay there until I come back. I'll talk to Niwal when I return.
If you need anything let me know.
Thank you so much, Hamza.
Niwal, are you okay?
I just felt dizzy.
Have some water quickly.
Sorry...
Are you worried about something?
No, I'm not.
I'll ask Kabir to take you to the doctor. Please send Kabir here.
Honestly, I'll go home, once I rest I'll get better.
I'll ask Kabir to drop you home. Have some more...
Thank you.
We can't change what happened, there's no point in sitting here like this.
What else should I do if not worry?
I don't have any other place to live as well.
What? You have this home, will you stay here?
The house was transferred to sister Niwal, I wanted to move from here.
This is what I planned.
What?
I'm disappointed in you, you sold the land and then transferred the house to sister Niwal.
The way I got the land was by transferring the house to sister Niwal.
Listen, think about it...
It's a big home, she won't stay here alone.
There is no need for you to go anywhere.
Talk to your sister affectionately. She's your sister and you know that...
sister Niwal has a soft nature if you talk to her affectionately.
she won't oust you from here.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It seems that my advice did not affect you
Where Falak invested the money has been stolen. That man has ran away to Dubai.
It was four crore rupees...
Really?
I want to stay away from this, but she's my sister and I can't ignore her.
You tried to make her understand, right?
You fulfilled your duties.
What can we do if she wants to harm herself?
She doesn't care about the loss. I couldn't sleep last night.
Don't worry, God will make everything better.
What have you decided?
Did you talk to someone?
Yes...
Do you want to file a report with the police or not?
I have.
I can't believe that we've endured such a loss.
If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have endured this loss today.
You have suffered for trusting someone blindly...
First, you sold the plot at a lower amount, because you were in a rush and then you gave the entire sum to Maria.
I didn't like that girl from the beginning,
that's why I asked you not to bring her here.
I'm ashamed sister, if only I had listened to you.
If I had this wouldn't be happening to me today.
Foolish girls like me lose everything...
Now, I don't have that plot or a roof over my head.
Forgive me, sister... I'm so sorry.
Don't worry... we can't change the mistake you made.
Allow me a few days... let me stay here for a few more days...
I've talked to my friend to find me a single-room apartment.
If she isn't able to find one, I'll go to a shelter.
Not at all!
This is your home, as much as it is mine.
No sister, I have no right over this home.
You're the sole owner of this house.
It's not mine.
You'll stay here and you'll go nowhere. I don't want to hear you say this again.
Now eat... here you are.
Tawqir, you look tired, are you feeling okay?
I'm fine... I'm just burdened by work.
I have to handle everything alone that's why...
I get so tired. Why don't you hire a staff for yourself?
You do your work and let them take care of the rest.
I've hired staff, but I have to supervise them, I can't just leave everything to them.
I find myself trapped.
Meetings... paperwork... visits... I have to handle everything alone.
Aliyah, why don't you come here?
Me?
Yes... I need help...
if you come here my burden will be lessened.
Farhan can't come here, so I have to take care of everything.
I was thinking that you should come here... it's a new company.
All of the people are new and I can't trust anyone.
I need you...
You're right...
but we have a business and our house here.
Now, we have Inham's responsibility as well.
If I leave, who will take care of this? It will be a problem for Kabir.
I don't think he'll be able to manage business with Inham.
Bring Inham here, she can live here as well.
This way Hafsa will be engaged with her.
Frankly speaking, I was thinking of permanently settling here.
After living here for a few weeks I've learned that business will flourish here.
I'll talk to Kabir and then let you know.
Alright, talk to him, once you talk to him let me know and I'll book the tickets.
Alright fine. Take care of yourself.
You too... and I miss you.
Farewell*
Surprise!
Hamza!
Oh my God!
How's my baby?
My dear, how come you're here?
Nazish, see who it is!
Yes, mother?
Hamza.... what a pleasant surprise.
Greetings, how are you?
Greetings to you. I'm fine. You didn't mention that you were coming.
If I had then would I be able to see you guys so happy?
You've been away for so long, I missed you.
I missed you as well. I brought a lot of gifts for you.
I'm sure he must have brought you toys and chocolates...
Did you bring chocolates for us as well?
Yes I did... and I brought dolls as well.
Yes, Mr. Qureshi...
No, I just reached out. I'll come to the office tomorrow.
Tawqir called... he was worried.
He said that he is burdened by work and he can't handle it alone.
He asked me to go there.
He wanted to take over the managerial post and handle everything.
Alright...
That's good... if you leave it will lessen the burden on him.
Yes but... what about you? How will you take care of everything here alone?
I mean... alongside business...
there's home... then there's Inham, you have her responsibility as well.
Tawqir stated that I should take Inham with me.
I did intend on taking her with me, if I left, I couldn't leave her alone.
What are you saying?
I won't let you leave with Inham.
Who else do I have besides her? What will I do without her?
I know that you are very emotional for her...
She's your daughter and you're attached to her. But right now she's a baby.
She needs extreme care and attention. Where will you find the time?
You won't be able to take care of her
You need not worry about her, she's my responsibility.
I will take care of her and will not give you a chance to complain...
Try and understand what I'm saying...
It's hard to manage a business at home, alone.
She's very young, let her leave with me. Focus on your business for now.
No sister...
If you take Inham, I'll go mad alone.
I told you, it would be alright.
If you ask me, I'll hire another nanny.
I'll put cameras around the house and I'll ask Niwal to visit often.
But please let Inham stay here, I promise that I won't let anything happen to her.
If you still don't believe me, I'll take Inham with me and take care of her there.
But please don't talk about taking Inham away.
Trust me, I'll take care of her.
Alright...
I can't think of taking her away with me.
It's obvious, you're her father.
But Kabir being a woman...
and a mother I would like to tell you...
that you will need to take care of Inham better than yourself.
I'll take good care of her.
More than myself... I promise.
Let me check up on her... I think she might be awake.
Sit down sir, I'll call her
Hamza, when did you get here?
Just today.
How is your tour?
It went well... I had fun. Where's Niwal.
She hasn't come back from work.
She's still at work?
She's late every day.
Often she stays at the office late.
Anyways, what can I say?
I have no value, most of her time is spent in the office with Kabir.
Or she goes to Kabir's home.
If you're asking me to, then Falak can meet my daughter.
thank you!
Hamza you?
Sit down, why are you standing?
I'm fine.
After mother, I feel as though...
there's no one to take care of me or ask how I'm doing
Sister Niwal treats me like an object with no value.
She doesn't care about me at all. She doesn't talk to me.
She doesn't care about me.
You know I fell victim to a fraud.
Maria ran away with my money, and instead of consoling me, she kept taunting me.
I wanted to leave my house but tell me...
where would I have gone?
I have no one... who would have taken care of me...
Mother married me early, I didn't get to complete my education as well.
If I had a degree I would have found a job, but who will hire me now?
Falak, don't worry... come to my office tomorrow,
I'll see what I can do.
No Hamza, there's no need for that. I don't want to become a burden on you.
It's not about becoming a burden.
I'm asking you to come to my office tomorrow.
If you're insisting so much, then I'll be there.
What's the matter? Are you thinking about sister Niwal?
I thought that she wouldn't be in contact with Kabir.
Contact? She goes to work daily.
They never stopped being in contact, even after you asked her not to.
Let me tell you the truth. Sister Niwal has invested in Kabir's business.
She's a partner now, that's why she doesn't listen to you.
What?
To tell you the truth I didn't know as well.
A few days ago I heard her talking to Kabir about this...
She said that she had ten percent in Kabir's food chain.
That's how I learned about this.
I can't believe that Niwal hid something like this from me.
What can I say? This has hurt me as much as it has hurt you.
But sister Niwal doesn't care about anyone but herself.
If I say something she fights me over things.
I won't say anything to her. She doesn't care about anyone else.
Don't worry, I'm with you.
Thank you Hamza...
Why are you standing? She might come early from work today.
No... I'll get going... I'll come by later.
Farewell.
Sister... are you finished packing?
Yes almost... I'm just missing some of Hafsa's stuff.
Really... that's good.
Sister I was thinking that I would wrap up in a few months and be there with you guys.
We can start our food business there.
You can check the environment there and it will be easier for me.
You can visit places where we can open restaurants.
Hmm... that's a good idea.
Right? You going there is good for brother Tawqir...
But it will be good for us as well.
New place, new people... new experience, and a new restaurant.
I was a little bit sad to leave... but hearing that idea...
I'm not anymore.
Me too.
This is your office.
My office?
How do you like it?
It's amazing... thank you so much.
I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here.
You're welcome, but there is no need to be so formal.
Sit down... I have a meeting. I'll go finish it, then we'll have coffee.
Okay... bye
When you're not here, I get very upset.
I feel alone.
I missed you mother...
Greetings*
I wanted to talk to you, wait.
Yes, what is it?
I was thinking of getting you and Niwal married.
Look, whatever misunderstandings you two have...
they are not that big.
Once you marry her everything will be alright.
Have you any idea what she did to me?
She hid something huge from me!
What did she hide from you?
She has invested in Kabir's business, she's his business partner.
You have no idea how angry I am right now.
It's not that big deal, I'll talk to her. It will be as you want. Just relax now.
He's so moody... thank God you're here, otherwise, he doesn't listen.
You're back early today? Or did you not go?
No, I didn't go. Sister Aliyah is going to Germany.
I visited her. She was worried for Inham and asked me to come by often.
I'm tired, I'm going to rest.
Hamza, did you talk to sister Niwal?
No.
If you don't talk to her then who will?
When mother was alive she used to stop her...
but now... you have to make her understand. You're about to marry her
and who will do it if not you?
She doesn't care about her respect. Now sister Aliyah has left as well.
She used to spend the entire day with Kabir, but there was sister Aliyah's presence.
Now that's not the case, they have an open pass now.
They can spend night and day together.
Falak, do you think these quotations are correct?
Sorry, Hamza if you were hurt by what I said. I just want the best for you.
But maybe like always I'm wrong.
Thank you... I'll look at these in my office and let you know.
I have to do something. This won't do.
Hamza doesn't react to anything that I say. 
Even though he should end his relationship.
What should I do that the game turns in my favor?
Miss... sister Falak is crying in her room.
What? Why is she crying?
I don't know, she's just crying.
Alright go... I'll check up on her.
Falak... what's the matter? Why are you crying?
Falak... why are you crying? What happened?
I miss Ilham... I want to meet her. I feel anxious... I want to see her.
Falak, I'll take you in the morning.
No sister, I can't spend the night like this.
Sister, I know that Kabir won't let me meet her.
Why not? Of course, he will. You're Ilham's mother, it's your right.
Kabir won't mind, especially if I talk to him. He'll like that you want to meet Ilham.
That's what you think. I know how Kabir is.
He's very stubborn. 
Sister, please do something. I want to meet my daughter...
I can't sit in peace, do something sister.
Wait till morning, I'll ask the driver to get to Ilham in the morning.
No, I want to go right now... please come with me now.
Do something... I want to meet her... once I see her I'll be fine. Please let's go.
Alright fine... get up... I'll call Kabir...
Let's go...
He'll let me meet her, right?
Yes, he will... no one will stop you.
Come here...
My dear child.
How are you? Your mother missed you.
She's crying... I'll take her outside. What happened...
After that visit, let me know.
We'll discuss this project in your office tomorrow.
Okay?
I'll ask my manager to contact you.
Excuse me.
Hello...
Hello Hamza...
Sister Niwal is still not home. I think she's still in Kabir's home.
You've helped me in my job and I have to help you as well.
If you don't believe me, you can go to Kabir's home.
I have to go... it's an emergency. I'll call you back.
Niwal, please don't mind. 
I didn't like Falak coming here and meeting Ilham
After the way she left, she had no right to meet Ilham. 
Legally she can't meet her as well.
You're right... Falak is her mother...
you, me, or anyone else can't stop her from meeting her daughter.
Legally you have the custody but...
you can't stop her from meeting her mother.
What are you saying?
You know how Falak left Ilham.
Still, you are defending her. You should have told her no at home.
Alright fine... Falak might be cruel but you're not.
What can I say...
Only because of you, I'll let Falak meet Ilham.
Thank you.
Hamza you?
Yes me...
What did you two think? Did you think I would not know what was going on between you two?
Mind your tone, Hamza?
I should mind my tone? 
You're a dishonorable man!
Have you no shame in having an affair with your ex-wife's sister?
What is this nonsense? Have you gone insane?
How long has this been going on between you?
Enough!
If you say one more word, I'll kill you.
You have it wrong... I brought Falak here...
She wanted to meet Ilham...
Really.... you came here with Falak?
Yes.
Where is she?
Out on the lawn with Ilham.
Alright...
See if she's there...
Where did she go?
Where's Falak?
Falak is not out on the lawn.
What do you mean?
She would be here if you had brought her here.
Believe me... Falak was crying and I brought her here to meet Ilham.
Just shut up!
I won't listen to your nonsense!
Do you think I'll believe all of your lies?
You know what, I always thought...
why do you favor this man...
Seeing it with my eyes, I've learned everything. You made a fool out of me.
I'm disappointed that I fell in love with a girl like you.
The truth is that you were never worthy of my love.
You always said that you didn't want to marry me.
You won't reject me... today I reject you.
I refuse to marry you.
