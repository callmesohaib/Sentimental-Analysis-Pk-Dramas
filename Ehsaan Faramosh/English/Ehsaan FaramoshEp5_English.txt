Aaliya?
Aunty, hello. How are you?
I'm well. Long time no see. Please sit.
What is all this?
I was coming to your place after such a long time so I couldn't come empty handed.
These are sweets for Kabeer's engagement.
Really? Hows the family?
They're a very nice family. The girl is also very nice.
The wedding is this month only and you'll have to come. You'll have to bring Hamza as well.
We'll definitely come.
Will you have tea or coffee?
Nothing at all. You know I'm coming from the office and we're drinking tea or coffee there everyday.
This cannot be. You'll have to eat something.
First tell me where is Hamza? How is his business going on these days?
Hamza is absolutely fine. He's very busy. Business is going great. He's always in the office.
And what about Nazish?
She's absolutely fine. Thank God.
Good. Should I say something?
You should get Hamza married now. How long will you be alone?
I'm tired of telling him but he puts me off saying its a new business and there are tons of responsibilities.
And he cannot take anymore responsibilities.
What is this? A wife isn't a burden. Once they have a life partner, they share so many of their responsibilities.
Yes but how to explain it to this boy. By the way you're very social. You meet a lot of people.
Find a girl for him.
By the way,I do have a girl in mind. Very smart and very decent.
Talk to Hamza once and if he agrees we'll meet the girl's family.
I'll make him agree. You talk to him. I'm sure things will fall into place.
Alright.
Now please allow me to leave.
Not at all. You cannot leave like this. Neelofar. Neelofar..
Aaliya is here after so many days. Get her some tea or coffee, biscuits, pastries.
Don't bother with too much. Get me a cup of coffee. And hurry up please, I have to rush.
Now tell me more. We haven't talked since ages. Whats up these days?
I'm short on time today. You should come to our hotel. We'll have lunch or dinner together and talk for long.
Sultana, I don't understand what you're doing. You left Nawal out and got Falak engaged before her.
You brought her up but now you'll get her married too?
Sister in law..
She is my daughter and I'll get her married too.
Get back in your senses. Nawal is your daughter by blood. She's elder than her.
She should be married first. Its her right.
Oh well.
Hello.
Hello my dear.
How are you aunt?
Hello. I'm fine.
Mom, I'm going to my room.
Alright.
I think you cannot see anything.
You have a witch in your house and its eating everything slowly.
Sister in law..
You don't know Falak. She's a very nice, well mannered girl.
I brought her up. She isn't like that.
I feel as if you don't know her.
Open your eyes before its too late.
When is brother coming in?
The weather in Islamabad didn't suit me. I got ill.
That's why I got here early. But he'll come tomorrow. His flight is at 2pm.
Then its alright. I'll give time for day after tomorrow.
You're being stubborn without any reason.
Its not so important for us to go there.
Why isn't it? I'll not go there without my younger brother and sister in law.
When you were in London, you were far away so it was okay.
But now since you're in Pakistan, I'll not leave you.
If you're insisting, its alright otherwise I don't want to go.
You'll go for me. Please.
Okay.
What is it brother? You've brought work from the office, home.
Yes. There was so much work so I thought I'd bring some home. You tell me how was your day?
My day was very nice.
Why wouldn't it be good? He was hanging out.
I saw you with Falak. And he lied to me that he was going to the airport to pick his friend.
I'm sorry. I thought I'd tell you later but you found out yourself.
Had you told me that you were going to meet Falak, I would have been happy.
Kabeer the beauty of every relationship lies in truth.
Now, I understand that you like to spend time with Falak and its a good thing.
But leaving important meeting and lying at the cost of all this, I think that's very unprofessional behavior.
Alright. Please stop.
You're lecturing my sweet, innocent younger brother.
I'm not lecturing him, I'm making him understand.
She's right.
Its my fault. I should have told the truth.
Its good that you understand.
Remember this, one wrong step in life can lead you astray.
I understand. I have an idea.
The conversation is very serious now. Coming back to Falak, whats the scene?
Brother, please..
Yesterday was my sister's engagement so I couldn't come but there is nothing between us that we should worry about one another.
Nobody can step over anyone without any reason.
First of all they believe that you're in their feet. A person is always insulted the most by people they like.
You valued money over love. You left me hanging to make your career. Without telling me anything.
Nawal, can you not forget it? I accept its my mistake. I should have told you before I left.
I apologize.
What should I do to make you forget and forgive me? How much will you punish me for one mistake?
Hamza, where are you? I have called you ten times since morning, your phone was off.
Nawal listen to me.
Where are you? Tell me. I'll come. We'll go somewhere outside.
Nawal I want to tell you something.
Yes tell me.
First promise me you'll hear me out. Completely.
Hamza what is it? You're worrying me. Tell me.
I came to London on the morning flight.
No. You're,
lying. You're joking.
No. I'm not joking. I'll send you my current location.
Nawal I knew you'd not believe me but what could I do? I had to set up my business in London.
It was important for me to come here.
But your business was set here already.
Yes but it isn't what I wanted like here.
You know business is my passion. My craze.
It wasn't growing like I wanted in Pakistan. I got the chance now Nawal. How could I let it go?
You decided for yourself, without talking to me. Without telling me.
I didn't realize I was so unimportant for you.
Its not like that Nawal. I tried to tell you so many times but I couldn't gather the courage.
I knew you'd stop me and I couldn't have faced you.
This is a lie.
You're a selfish person. You couldn't see anything other than your happiness.
You don't care about others.
I care about you Nawal.
Had you cared for me, you wouldn't have left me.
I will come back Nawal. I promise you. I love you very much.
Please try and understand me.
Your love is a lie. Just like you.
How could I trust someone, why should I wait for a person who valued money over love?
You value your desires over anybody else's happiness.
Nawal.. Please.
Trust me. Its just for a few months. Hello? Nawal?
I will never forgive you. Never. You hurt my emotions.
You came back after five years and you think everything will be like it was earlier. You're mistaken now.
Nothing is like it was earlier. Nothing. I only have hatred in my heart for you. Only hatred.
You're off today.
I'm going to the grocery store. I wanted to get a few things. You tell me if you need anything.
No. I don't need anything. Just that do you remember we have to go finalize Falak's wedding date today. Don't be late.
Of course I remember. Don't worry.
Now tell me, aunt and uncle will be here, won't they?
They said they would be. Where is Falak?
Falak is in her room.
I'll go meet her.
Okay.
Falak? Falak? Oh, shopping?
Yes. I went to the mall yesterday.
I liked them so I bought them.
They seem very expensive.
I think as far as I remember you didn't have money in your card.
Yes, I didn't buy them. A friend of mine got me these.
So expensive?
Yes. It was her birthday. She bought something for everyone so this was for me.
Falak, I don't think you should accept such an expensive gift from your friend.
You're always scolding me.
I couldn't say no because she insisted so much. I couldn't break her heart. You know me.
Alright. I was going to the market. I thought I'd ask you.
You go ahead. Mom said we had to go to Kabeer's in the evening so I'll just get ready.
Alright. Message me if you need anything.
What are you doing? Pick up these sweets and get them in the car. Take this when you're back.
Where is Falak? We're getting late.
She'll be here. You're looking fine.
This color suits you.
She's here.
How do I look?
Very pretty. Different. All praise to the Lord.
May God save my daughter from all evil eyes.
Oh. First lets discuss that.
Discuss what?
Actually we wanted to tell Kabeer's family about you before we fix the date.
Tell what?
That I'm a servant's daughter? Do you know what will happen then? They'll say no.
Falak this will not happen. They're very good people.
What does being good mean? Why would they want to bring a servant's daughter as their daughter in law?
Mom, if you want to get me insulted, its best if you call them from home.
They'll say the same things about a servant's daughter..
Why are you repeating being a servant's daughter again and again?
Your parents were not thieves that you want to hide their identity.
This is nothing to be insulted about. You're an educated, mature girl.
See Falak..
If we don't tell them now and if they find out in the future, what will we do?
We want to tell them so that it won't create any problem for you in the future.
Mom, you won't do such a thing. You'll not say anything to anyone.
Falak.. Falak..
See dear, those building that are built on lies in their foundation, they're not strong. Try to understand this.
Don't worry. Mom will talk and handle everything.
Nothing will be handled after this. But if you still want to do it, I'll tell you this. You'll be responsible for everything that happens afterwards. I'll kill myself.
Falak.. Listen to me.
Go and see her, Nawal.
Mom, its important to tell them. They'll find the truth one day and then how many people will we be answerable too.
Alright. Go and look. We're getting late. We have to pick my brother and sister in law.
I'll go call her.
Falak..
All praise to the Lord, you have a big house.
Hmm.
I love the interior of your house. You have given quite an artistic touch. Who designed it for you?
Actually Aaliya designed it herself.
Oh wow really. I'll have to compliment you.
You have maintained your house so well alongside your business.
Thank you very much.
Kabeer, you take Nawal and Falak along and show them the house. Show them your room.
Of course, sister in law. Please come.
This is my room. Hopefully you people like it. How is it?
Its nice.
Its nice. Sorry one second.
I'll just attend this call and come.
So when do you want to finalize the date for?
We wanted to finalize a date for this month only.
Falak has her exams next week and it'll take a week for her exams to end.
Then we'll have to do a few preparations. You can have any date for the next month.
Alright. Then we should finalize the first Friday of the next month. How does that sound?
Its a good deed and an auspicious day.
Alright then. Friday will be fine. Isn't it Sultana?
I wanted to have some time for the preparations but if you people think its fine, I have no objections.
See, we have already told you that we don't want any dowry. Anything that burdens a girl's family, we don't want it.
We won't have anything.
You're absolutely right Aaliya but we cannot marry off our daughters empty handed. We have to give them something.
Sultana don't be stubborn. They're right.
Yes. As you people say.
See, I'm telling you.
Please don't worry. We're bringing Falak here like the daughter of this house. Not a daughter in law.
Thank you very much. I trust you.
Sultana. Did you tell these people about Falak's background?
What are you saying?
We shouldn't be hiding it. Tell them..
Tell us what? What are you two talking about?
Actually Aaliya, Touqeer..
Mom? Mom?
Oh my God. Hafsa..
Hafsa dear..
Are you alright?
sister Aaliya set everything in this room according to her taste.
Yes but you should have chosen a few things yourself.
You know what? I have terrible taste.
But still. I think Aaliya influence your life very much.
As it is, there are very few people as obedient as you in times like today.
After my mom and dad passed away. Sister Aaliya took care of me.
She encouraged me.
Even she helped me set my business and whatever I'm today, I'm because of her. That is why,
if I'm thankful to anybody after God, that is sister Aaliya because she and my brother are just like my parents.
This is such a good thing. But its fine as far as your business is concerned but you'd have some likes for your room.
Had I been in your place I would have decorated my room, myself.
You're very cute.
Are you alright, dear?
Is she alright?
Thnk God she's fine. You know how kids don't care about anything else.
Kids grow up like this. They fall down. They're okay.
You wanted to talk about something.
Actually I wanted to tell you that.
Actually my sister in law wants to say that..
Falak is quite young and immature and marriage is a big responsibility.
If she makes a mistake, please ignore it.
I've told you a lot of times and I'll tell you again,
Falak will come here as the daughter of this house, not a daughter in law.
You shouldn't worry about her. She'll not face any problem in this house. Isn't it?
Exactly.
Thank you very much.
Alright fine. When you come here, you can set everything as you like. Alright?
Of course, I'll do everything with my choice.
Nobody will stop you.
Now should we go downstairs, everybody must be waiting.
Yes. Lets go.
Please take this.
Thank you very much. We're already stuffed.
The food is very tasty. I'm pine for such food in London.
Sir, all credit goes to my wife. Aaliya cooks in our house.
All praise to the Lord.
By the way, Aaliya I'm very impressed by you.
The way you've managed everything. Your career, your house, the interior, your family and,
everything around the house. Very impressive.
We have servants to do everything but the kitchen and food, I prefer to cook myself.
When everybody works hard around the day, the food at least should be healthy and tasty.
You're absolutely right but our Falak might face a little difficulty.
What do you mean?
Actually Falak is our pampered child. We have never given her any responsibility of working around the house.
Its alright. She'll learn. I'll teach her. You'll see how Falak will be just like me in a few months. Isn't it?
Its difficult because Falak isn't interested in all this. Falak likes to go out, eating out,
and shopping. Isn't it Falak?
She'll have to take interest. As they say the way to your husband's heart is through his stomach.
Of course and as it is, Kabeer cannot digest outside food. Didn't you tell her that?
Exactly. I spend all day in the hotel so when we come home we prefer homemade food.
Falak will also learn gradually.
Why not? Falak you also say something. You're not speaking at all.
What can I say? I'm enjoying the food. You people please talk.
By the way Nazish is coming tomorrow.
Wow. That's great. When is her flight due?
Its around 2pm. You'll have to pick her up from the airport.
But I have a very important meeting at 2.
But its alright. You can go with the driver.
Won't you ask why your sister is coming to Pakistan all of a sudden?
She's coming to meet us. What is there to ask about?
No. I called her here for a special mission.
Oh. Special mission? What is that?
Your marriage. Whenever I talk to you about it, you put me off.
Now since she's coming, she'll ask you herself why don't you want to get married?
You're doing this on purpose.
Before today, you never talked about it or you were never stubborn.
Something happened to you suddenly that you're now after my life.
Dear, you're already late. You're so busy with your business
that you don't realize that you have this entire chapter missing in your life.
I feel the company you're sitting with these days is to be blamed.
No. Not fair. You cannot blame anybody else. I'll get you married now. Whether you like it or not.
If you like someone, tell your sister. We'll talk to her family.
You don't need to be shy. But if there's nothing like that, then,
I'll find a girl for you myself. You'll have to get married whether you like it or not.
I don't care. She'll take care of you now.
Sultana I don't understand why you're hiding this from them. It isn't a small thing.
They'll find out one day, one way or the other.
She's right. You have no reason to hide and you shouldn't keep them in the dark.
They're family now and Sultana I think they should know.
Brother.. Sister in law..
Actually Falak doesn't want them to know about this.
What?
Falak doesn't want it and you'll listen to her and hide such a big thing. Whats wrong with you?
See, don't take me wrong. Falak is a child. 
She doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
But you're sensible. You should know that its your daughter's.. I mean they're Falak's in laws.
They'll find out about it one day, what will you do then? 
They'll ask you questions then how will you answer them? Such things call off relationships.
Then will you get Falak married again?
God forbid. What are you saying?
Sultana you're mistaken.
Sultana thinks I don't like Falak and that's why I'm saying this but this is the truth.
Hiding such a small thing can stir up a big storm. No matter where you get her hitched, lying,
is against the ethics.
Sister in law, Falak doesn't want them to know so I'll not mention it to anyone.
I cannot put my daughter in trouble and truths that foretell disaster,
its best if they stay hidden for as long as possible. Everybody will find out when the time is right.
Alright. Your wish. Do as you want to do.
Who are we to say anything? Safdar lets go. We're getting late.
Sister in law..
Sister in law. Let him eat something.
We ate at Aaliya's, now I'm full.
But sister in law..
Don't worry. She'll be fine. Alright?
Whats wrong with you?
I heard everything. What is uncle and aunt's problem?
Be mindful of them. They're elder and your uncle and aunt.
Did aunt and uncle leave? Weren't they staying the night?
Yes, they had some work so they left. They'll come again.
Mom, I'm telling you.
Tell uncle, especially aunt that nobody needs to interfere in our personal matters.
What happened?
My brother and sister in law insisted that Kabeer's family should know about Falak.
Falak listened to everything.
We should have told them. We wanted the same thing.
But if Falak doesn't want us to tell, what can we do?
She doesn't want Kabeer's family to know.
She is upset because of that only.
Go and see her. She's a very emotional girl.
I'll see.
Falak...
What is aunt's problem with me? God knows what she against me.
She doesn't have any problem with you.
You know how blunt she is since forever. She doesn't have a bad heart its just,
her tone is bitter.
Some tones cut people deep within. They finish them.
Alright. Let it be. I am still influenced by the lifestyle of your in laws.
What a house. Superb. Aaliya has done such a wonderful interior. Kabeer's room. You're very lucky.
I think this is what aunt is jealous about.
Don't say like this Falak.
Did you note, Aaliya has complete control in the house. Everything happens with her will.
I'm inspired by her. 
She is handling everything. Her house, business, family, social circle. I've seen very few women like her.
Please stop it now.
I think she is a selfish woman. She likes to be complimented. 
That's why she likes to do everything by her own self.
You are always thinking negatively.
I'm not being negative. Why should one work themselves when they have so many servants.
Its not a good thing.
She likes it and if a woman won't look after her house, who will?
sister Nawal you sound totally like her. Please.
 I've thought only Kabeer is going to be my responsibility. I'll only look after our things. It won't matter who does what in that house.
I don't like working like servants. People only suit to the role they're assigned to.
Falak.. You..
I'm tired. You please leave and switch off the lights when you go.
Touqeer, don't you think Sultana aunty is hiding something from us.
I mean when Fariha aunty said something about Falak, did you see how Sultana aunty lost all color?
Hmm. You're right. Even I felt something off.
I don't know why I feel as if there is something.
There are some people who create mysteries without any reason.
Let it go.
Touqeer, such a thing while fixing the date.
Maybe there is something they're hiding from us.
Whats wrong with you? Why are you being Sherlock Holmes?
I'm serious.
You're the limit. She hasn't come to the house and you've built a battlefront for her.
Tell me, what possibly can they hide from us. 
This is what we should think about. Maybe we have a misunderstanding.
And if you're not at peace, you should call Farheen. She'll tell you.
You're right. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Its not important that whatever we see,
is what we perceive it to be. Maybe its something else.
Yes. That exactly my point. Now since you've wasted so much of my energy, go and make me black coffee.
You're very clever. You know the servants are asleep by now and you'll get the one I make.
You know the one you made is the best.
Hello?
What are you doing? Where are you?
Where else would I be? I'm working.
Don't you get bored working all day. The weather is very good. Lets go out somewhere.
I like working when its time to work.
So what, take out some time. The weather is so good. Lets hang out and have lunch somewhere good.
I'm sorry Falak. My meeting will start in a bit.
Yes so if you have a meeting, sister Aaliya will take care of it. She always does.
You come and pick me.
This meeting is of my department. She doesn't know anything about it.
So you're saying no to me?
I'm not saying no. We'll go tomorrow.
No. I have to go today and with you only. Take me now.
Falak whats wrong? Why are you insisting like a child?
I said we'll go tomorrow. Listen, its time for my meeting. I'll talk when I'm free.
Hello? Kabeer....
Come, sit. You must be tired. How was your flight?
It was good, mom.
Where is Hamza? He didn't even come to pick me.
Dear he said he was busy. He couldn't come to the airport.
Mom haven't you given him a free hand? Couldn't he take out time to come pick me up?
Now look at me. I came so far away, leaving my husband and daughter behind, just for him.
Dear don't you know your brother? He's crazy about his business.
 Work comes first and everything else is secondary. That's why.
This is why he's all alone mom. 
Trust me, I had such good proposals. So many asked for him in my in laws.
What can I do, he doesn't listen to me. Now you're here. Do something.
Alright. Don't worry. I'm here. I'll handle everything. Don't worry. I'll take care.
Superb. Now have something to drink.
Please you too have something mom.
Not yet. I'll have tea later.
Sir, these are the invoices from our food and labor suppliers. Please have a look
Sure. I'll look. Thank you.
Thank you sir.
