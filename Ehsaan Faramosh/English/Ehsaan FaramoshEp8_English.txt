I cannot live without you.
I don't trust you anymore, Hamza.
You left me once and you could do it again.
That's why I cannot marry you.
Listen to me, then.
Nawal?
If you're free, I came to ask when should we leave?
You just wait. I'm coming.
Okay.
Listen to me
No. You listen to me. If you try to come close to me again, you'll see the worst of me.
Why are you so beautiful?
You scared me. Where were you, I was waiting for you since long.
I'm so sorry. I was in a very important meeting. I came as soon as I got free.
I have a call. Excuse me. Just a minute.
Yes? Sister in law?
I came for an important work.
Look at her.
Why is everyone looking at me like this? Is there something on my face?
No mam. You have nothing on your face.
So?
People are talking about you and boss in the office.
What are people saying?
That you and boss have an affair.
Why are they all talking nonsense? There is nothing between me and boss.
Mam, after what happened last night and the way boss was holding your hand, whoever looks at it, will be mistaken.
Who told you this?
Everybody knows about this. Sara is spreading all these rumors with fun.
Falak where were you? I've been looking for you.
Yes. I saw.
You were restlessly searching for me.
You think its a joke. I almost died.
I thought my world turned dark.
You love me so much?
Do you doubt my love for you?
Don't do this ever again. Come on now.
Is this what you wanted? To make a spectacle out of me?
What happened Nawal?
How many times did I tell you to let our past stay buried?
People are discussing us. Because you.. you didn't listen to me once. And now see.
Everybody in the office knows now. I cannot face anyone. Everybody is eyeing me weirdly.
Get a grip on yourself.
Whatever happened was unintentional. Neither you, nor I wanted it to happen.
And as it is, everybody has to find out one day.
What?
You're still saying this?
Yes. I'm saying this even now. Everybody had to find out sooner or later. Better now.
I really like you and you like me.
I'm warning you. I'm warning you. Don't say this to me again.
I hate you. So much that words cannot express it.
You insulted me in front of everyone and now you're declaring your love for me?
Is this what love is? This might be love for you but not for me.
People are looking at me with questioning eyes. How many people should I answer?
Is this what you give me in return?
You got me disrespected in front of everyone.
I should have resigned on the first day. I made a mistake listening to you.
Nawal.. You will do no such thing.
Do you think you can stop me?
After so much insult, I don't have any reason to stay here.
If you're saying the people are good, then they must be good.
See Sultana, we don't find such proposals everyday. You should talk to Nawal.
She should listen to you because you're her mother.
I talked to Nawal. She said she wanted some time.
Falak is getting married before Nawal even when she's elder than her.
Right now she's getting proposals but if more time passes, you'll regret listening to her.
I'll try talking to her.
See they have more proposals as well.
This is a good proposal. The boy is an IT engineer, sensible and mature.
The family is very small. His mother and a brother. Father is dead.
They have their own house and they have more properties as well. What more do you want?
Yes, you're right.
I mentioned Nawal to them and they want a girl like her, sensible and well brought up.
Sultana, they won't wait for long.
I'll try and talk to her.
Nawal, how are you dear?
Hello.
Hello. How's your job coming along?
Absolutely fine. I'll just go and change.
See Sultana, don't worry. Don't be anxious. They're a very good family. I can guarantee.
They'll care for Nawal like their own.
Alright. I'll leave now. I'll wait for you call
I'll talk to Nawal and tell you. I hope she agrees.
As God wills. Don't worry. Alright, bye.
Come.
Welcome.
Why did you bring me to your house?
Its not my house. Its your house. In fact its ours.
But still it doesn't look good. Mom, sister Nawal, nobody knows anything.
What will sister Aaliya think?
You worry about everyone.
Nobody will think anything. Just relax. Come along now.
Falak?
Oh, sister in law?
Hello. How are you?
Greetings! I'm good. I'm so happy to see you here. Kabeer I was just going to your room.
I have to finish the setting. Its good that you're here. Come, we'll do it together.
Don't change anything yet.
But why? We don't have much time. We just have two days. We need to get things done.
That's why I brought Falak. She'll tell how she wants the room set.
What will I tell?
But you said you want to set your room yourself, that's why I brought you here
But Kabeer I was only joking.
Whats there to joke about?
But sister Aaliya is here. She'll decorate it for us.
Its good that Kabeer brought you here. Its your room. You should set it yourself.
What this? You decorated the entire house as you like and its beautiful, then why not our room?
Because its your room and now you should set it as you like.
You're here now. Go upstairs and see. I'll get you both tea.
Thank you.
Come along. We need to get this done.
Mom, is Arifa aunty gone?
Yes dear, she left. Please sit, I want to talk to you.
Yes tell me.
Actually Arifa is asking about the proposal I mentioned to you.
She's saying the family is very good. Now please tell me whether you want to accept it or not so that I can answer her.
Its a good proposal and you'll have to get married some day.
Whats the problem in accepting such a good proposal?
See Nawal if you have anything in your heart, if you're anxious about anything, at least share with me.
I have no objections. You can invite them.
Really? Should I really invite them? I have your consent?
You have lightened the burden on my heart.
Arifa was telling me that they're very good people. Nawal will be very happy there.
Are you sure, should I invite them tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll just..
Thank God..
I've not finished what I was saying yet.
I want to send my mother to your house.
Sister?
Sister, I'm so happy for you. Very happy.
What happened? Why are you so happy for me?
Mom told me you said yes to getting married. I'm so happy for you.
Mom has invited the boy's family over tomorrow.
Alright. Now keep your bags on the side.
But I'm still upset. If you had agreed earlier, you would have been married before me.
I had so many dreams. I wanted to do so much on your wedding. I wanted to enjoy your wedding.
You will still enjoy. You will fulfill all your wishes, nobody will stop you.
But I'm very happy for you. Really. I'll tell you something interesting. Sit here.
Do you know, Kabeer took me home?
Home? For what?
Actually he wanted me to decorate our room. He said I was free to decorate it as I liked.
You went to Kabeer's house?
Yes. You know sister Aaliya was doing it earlier but Kabeer told her not to. She was so embarrassed.
No Kabeer did wrong. He shouldn't have done it.
If she was setting the room, he should have let her do it. She's elder.
Even I was embarrassed.
I told no to Kabeer but they said that since I would live there I should set my room as I liked.
What could I say then.
You should have said no. You should respect elders.
You leave everything and see this. See what I brought. You'll like it. See this. How does it look?
Its beautiful.
And this one as well.
Whats the use of you coming over dear? We couldn't get done what I called you for.
I talked to Hamza.
He wants some time.
Some time? Have you seen his age? How much time does he want?
Ridiculous. What does this boy want?
Mom, actually he likes his university fellow
What? No. He never mentioned this to me. How could this be? Let him come. I'll talk to him.
Yes? Hello Asad, How are you? What?
What happened?
What happened to Naveen. Yes. I'm coming.
What happened?
What happened dear? What?
Mom Naveen fell down the stairs. She's not good. She's in emergency.
What happened? Why are you crying?
Naveen fell down the stairs. She's in emergency.
What? Where was brother Asad?
I don't know. Hamza get me a ticket to go back.
Get mine as well. I'll go with her.
Yes, I'll just check.
Come.
I'll go pack.
Oh wow. Mom this is very pretty. See.
They're looking good. These are pretty too. Look.
This is very heavy mom.
Yes it is heavy. My mother in law gave it to me. But you know I don't wear such heavy jewelry.
Now since you have everything done now, I want to keep these for Nawal.
Kabeer told me that they had made four gold sets.
And we have two. Mom, don't you think its a bit less?
No. You've already done enough. Two sets are enough.
I don't want to burden you anymore.
Falak what are you saying?
How many times earlier have I told you that daughters are never a burden on their parents.
And when Kabeer had already told you they would be giving you four sets, you should have told me, we would have gotten 2 more.
Mom if I knew you had these, I would have asked you to give me any one of these.
I would then have something to remind me of you.
I just got a little emotional.
Alright, now do one thing. You keep this set.
I didn't even think about it earlier or else I'd have given you this.
No mom. This is for sister Nawal. I cannot take it.
Oh Falak. We're not two separate people. When its time for my wedding, I'll get a new one.
Falak, take this and don't talk much. Keep it safe in the cupboard now.
Since you're insisting I'll keep it but mom I really don't want to.
Stop it Falak and go keep it.
Do you want all of us to cry? Now go and keep it in the cupboard.
Thank you mom. Thank you so much. Thank you sister.
You're most welcome.
I'll just go and keep it.
Keep it safe.
Now you're emotional. You cry on every little thing.
She's so emotional. I didn't even think about it.
Listen, Arifa called. They'll come around 2pm tomorrow.
See all the arrangements I've made and if anything is missing.
I'll see.
Why did you have to be so formal?
It doesn't look good to come to receive your daughter empty handed.
Please come and sit.
Please sit dear.
By the way, you people have been very formal. You're embarrassing me.
Asjad thought this was still very less.
No formalities aunty. Think of it as something that makes us happy.
sister Arifa isn't here with you.
I talked to her brother. She said she was busy with some emergency and she'd come around in a day or two
Alright. So Asjad dear, what do you do?
Uncle I'm a Master in IT and I'm working in a multinational company.
All praise to the lord.
Actually after Asjad's father's death, Asjad has taken over the entire responsibility of the house.
He educated his brother, he looks after me. He looks after me and my son is a very responsible person.
All praise to the lord.
They're here and you're not ready yet.
I'm ready.
Oh God. You should have worn something nice.
Its fine. Whats wrong with it?
Its fine but you need to darken your make up. Sit. Is this make up?
Had I known you'd wear this earlier, I'd have come and fixed you up.
I look fine.
Now you look nice. Do you know I saw the guy? He's very handsome.
Yes mom told me.
Now lets go. Hurry up. Come one.
A second..
No. Hurry up. Come on..
This is my elder daughter Nawal and the younger one, Falak.
Come dear. Come sit with me.
All praise to the lord. Your daughter is very pretty.
Thank you.
We really like your daughter.
Its all about fate. Asjad has cousins his age but Asjad wants to marry a girl who is well brought up and sensible.
Thats why when I mentioned it to Arifa, she told us about you.
Think of it as fate bringing us to your doorstep.
Nawal has a job.
We have no objections. She can work if she wants to after the wedding. We will have no objections.
Please smile a little. I don't want Asjad to think you're not happy about the wedding.
Your in laws seem to be very good natured people.
Falak?
Yes mom.
Get some refreshments with the tea. Go on.
Yes. Sure.
Brother, Asjad is here in front of you.
Ask him whatever you want to your satisfaction and then you can come over to the house whenever you want to.
We have no objections about this proposal.
Yes of course we'll visit your house, very soon. As God wills.
Hello sir.
Hello.
Sir this is Ms. Nawal's resignation.
Call her in a day or two and tell her that I haven't accepted her resignation.
Ask her to rejoin immediately.
Okay sir.
And if she says no, tell her to fulfill her agreement because no employee can resign without completing their agreement.
And those who don't follow the company rules, the company will sue them.
Okay sir.
If that is how then so be it. I'll not let you go so easily.
Whatever happened was unintentional. Neither you, nor I wanted it.
But sooner or later everyone had to find out. Whether today or tomorrow, whats the difference?
I like you very much and you like me too.
Will you not ask me anything? People have a lot of concerns about their life partner.
I do have concerns.
But nobody is perfect. We have to accept them with their goods and bads.
But I really liked your habit of respecting other people.
You're exactly what Arifa aunty told us about you.
What did she tell you?
That you're very mature and I like mature women because they know how to stick by their relationships.
When I heard about you, I told mom that I'd marry you. Immediately.
See the thing is I take everything I do, seriously.
I work throughout the day and sometimes I come home at night or in the evening. So..
Don't worry. I have a maid who cooks really well.
And I make really good coffee. When you get back from work, we'll have dinner and then coffee together.
Nawal, I like girls who are not dependent on other and live life on their own terms.
Girls who make their own decisions. Like you.
I like men who don't lie. Men who tell the truth.
Lies make relationships weak. I don't have such bad habits.
I liked meeting you.
Whats going on mam?
See I have received all the dresses I got made for Falak's wedding. Aren't they good?
Oh wow.
But sister in law, you can also ask Falak. What if she doesn't wear such clothes?
Bridal dresses are like this. Do you remember hers? They were even heavier than these.
Do you think I got everything without asking Falak's wishes?
Don't worry. Falak bought all this she liked herself.
Oh so tell me that.
Yes so did you get the wedding present?
Yes I did.
So whats going on in the office. I'm completely out of touch.
Yes all good. We have a meeting with the suppliers tomorrow.
Sister in law, I was wondering if you could get some time and come to the office tomorrow. I have a few things to do.
You have your wedding function tomorrow and you're going to work. Its the limit.
Brother what can we do, our business is as such.
The event is in the evening. We don't have much to do in the day so I'll come to the office. Don't worry.
I swear both of you don't think anything else other than making money and your business 
and I won't be surprised if you head to the office on your wedding day..
I really liked those people and Asjad impressed me a lot. To be honest, men like him are hardly found in this age.
You're right. I really liked their family. So Fariha, what did you think?
Yes. There's no doubt about that.
The family is really very nice.
Alright then, once Falak is married, we'll immediately go to their house so that we can see where they live.
What do you people think?
Ask Nawal about her opinion as well. So dear, how did you find Asjad?
You people are my elders. I'd accept whatever decision you make.
Dear I really liked their family and even Sultana does so.
Then once Falak is married, we'll go and see their house then and then we'll have a proper ceremony.
Alright.
I just pray to God to give my daughters the best of fates.
Amen.
Here sister. You should also eat this half eaten sweet so that you can also get married soon. Come on. Eat.
Now Nawal will be married soon, for sure.
