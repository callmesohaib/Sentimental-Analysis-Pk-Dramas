I told you that you don't need to get worried for me.
My life isn't easy!
You think that my life was easy?
You chose that life!
Nobody forced you!
Your dream was more important to you!
This is why I feel ashamed.
I chose my dreams over my relations.
You should drop me to my home!
Falak! Why don't you understand? I have to reach that place on time.
Fine Kabir! Drop me here! I'll go home by cab.
I won't call you after today and I won't ask you to meet me.
You are forcing me! I feel like a burden to you.
That's why you want to get rid of me.
You are so stupid! Children are never a burden on parents.
Why are you forcing?
Falak is getting married because it was written for her. I'll marry when it's written for me.
Me and Kabir planned a surprise for you!
How's the surprise?
You would've not thought that I'll be here for you.
I didn't! I like it! Sister in law! You should have told me.
If I told you already! What will be the surprise? How could we see that natural smile?
Excuse me!
Greetings!
We are looking for dresses for wedding! It's her wedding. Show some nice designs.
Come!
Come!
This is nice!
Show this with the shirt!
Kabir! Do you like it?
This looks so beautiful!
The design is so perfect! Do you like it?
It looks nice!
I like it too! Kabir! What about you?
Yes! It's nice! The color is nice! Everything suits perfectly on Falak.
Right!
If Kabir likes it! We can choose this.
She should try it once.
No! Not before the wedding.
I mean that she should wear it for the fitting! We should check it. I just want to see a glance.
Sit! We are coming!
Falak! Come and try it.
Hamza!
You told her to talk to me?
Who?
I'm shocked by such a weird action of yours.
Our past was between us! Why are you including others?
Navaal! Whom are you talking about?
I'm talking about your sister.
She talked to me about your proposal.
What? Did she come to the office?
She didn't just come here! She asked me the reason of rejecting your proposal.
I'm sorry! I apologize from her side.
Hamza! If you want to create a drama related to our past..
and want to hurt me! I won't allow you to do that.
You are misunderstanding! I cannot think about such a thing.
I respect you a lot!
I can see that!
You really do respect me!
We decided that we won't talk about the past.
We won't talk to each other about it! Neither will we discuss it with somebody else.
You call this respect that you are telling it to everyone?
I just talked to her! I don't know what she thought!
I'll talk to her and tell her that she doesn't need to discuss it.
I don't trust you! You should know that our ways are separate.
Ways cannot be forcefully joined!
What did you do sister?
Wear it!
It looks nice!
This looks so decent! Here! Try this.
It looks good! See Kabir.
If you like this! Let's choose this.
Tell us what you like!
Whatever you decide!
She doesn't need to wear decent for her wedding!
Lets see some other designs!
We can see other designs!
Where should I put this?
Light it on fire!
What are you looking at? Just put it!
Sister in law! Sister in law! Everything is decided by Sister in law! Sister in law !
Kabir can't help me on his own?
It's my wedding and shopping is chosen by Aliya!
Sure! My name is Falak!
I'll get done with this Aliya!
Sister! Why did you come to my office and talk to Navaal?
Hamza! Somebody had to talk to her. I don't understand! Why are you so scared?
I'm so surprised! How can a girl reject you like that?
I just wanted to ask her that! But..
I felt like!
She didn't reject you because she likes somebody else! It's something weird.
We had a break up.
I know! What's the reason for the break up?
It's me! I'm the reason.
5 years ago! When I shifted to London for business.
I didn't tell her!
That's why she broke up with me!
What? are you in your senses?
You didn't tell her about your departure?
Hamza! You told her that you love her.
On the other side! You didn't even inform her?
Now I understand her feelings!
Any other girl in the place of Navaal would've done the same!
A girl never trusts a person who hides something important from her.
Someone who lies.
You broke Navaal's trust!
I was scared! She would've stopped me from going.
She would've forced me!
I'm sure that if you had told her! She would've never stopped you.
She would've been happy!
That's my wrong!
I left everything for money!
Do you know? I used to walk in front of a shop in London.
It was an antique shop.
The things in that shop were sold for cheap because it people didn't know the value.
The shop's owner used to tell me.
The same people come to him to buy those things because they realized their value.
It was late.
Same happened with me!
I'm back!
But it's late.
Hamza! Things don't have a comparison with people.
Things don't have a heart.
Humans have it!
Things are precious but a persons love is priceless.
Tell her about your regret.
Go Hamza! Talk to her. She needs you.
Mother! I can't find my wedding dress
What do you mean? Where did you place it?
I placed all the bags in my room.
Go and look in your room.
Mother! I've checked. It's not there.
How is that possible? I'll ask Shaheen!
Wait! I'll check again.
What is she doing?
She misplaces important things.
Fresh and hot tea for you!
I actually needed it!
Did you visit the designer.
No! I'll meet him.
What's the hurry?
Hurry? There are no days left in wedding.
I'm joking Aliya! I've met him. Everything is looked after.
Tell me about Falak's shopping.
Yes!
I don't know! I noted that..
Falak stays quiet! She looks like she wants to speak but she doesn't.
I don't know! You are having a misunderstanding.
It can be possible! Some people are quiet.
So maybe she is that person.
But I felt like she was so happy in the start when me and Kabir surprised her.
When we started to shop! She became so shy.
Mother! Mother!
Yes?
It's not in the room!
It's not? Where did it go Falak?
Mother! Did it stay in sister Aliya's car? Did we forget it on a shop?
I'm getting worried! It was an expensive dress.
It's shocking!
I'll call sister Aliya!
Yes! Do it.
I'm worried!
Wait! Give me a minute.
She is calling!
Hello!
sister Aliya! I wanted to talk to you.
Is everything fine.
That dress you bought for me! I can't find it. I'm worried.
It'll be there! Where can it go?
sister Aliya! All the bags are here. That particular bag is missing.
I feel like we have forgotten it in a shop.
You should ask driver to look for it in the car.
But Falak! I gave that bag to you myself. How will it be with me?
You should just check it one! It can be there.
I would've found it if it was here.
I'll look for it! Don't be worried.
Don't be worried.
It would be in the room.
Mother! I've checked two times. It's not there.
I'll help you find it.
What happened?
The wedding dress we bought.
She can't find it! I'll go check it in the car.
Go and look.
Nasreen! Nasreen!
Yes Ma'am!
Ask the driver to check the car for any shopping bag.
Sure!
Ma'am! The driver is telling that there's no shopping bag in car.
Fine!
I remember that I gave the bag to Falak!
Falak is worried about the dress.
I'm worried about it too.
I even checked the CCTV footage of shop.
When exiting the mall. Shopping bag was in the hands of Falak.
Falak's hand?
You checked the CCTV? You didn't trust me?
It's not like that! I trust you.
I had to look because I wanted to know that the shop owner isn't lying.
You have seen the CCTV.
If I had cameras in house. I would've shown you the footage too.
When I returned. I didn't have the bag.
Did you guys stop in the way?
We didn't stop.
Falak! You should check your cupboard again.
Mother! I've checked. I didn't find anything.
sister Aliya! Ask your driver to look for the bag in the car. It'll be there.
When you called! I did ask him. He checked properly. He didn't find anything.
Where did it get lost?
you've done so much of investigation, that people are checking CCTV.
Where is it?
It was so expensive! I liked it.
What should I do? I can't find it.
Falak! What is it?
Control yourself Falak! everything will be fine.
We'll find it! Don't you worry.
I have to go for some important work.
Take care! I'll try to visit again in the evening.
Fine! Just don't cry.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Mother! Where did it get lost.
Falak! Where can it go?
It's the dress for wedding. You have misplaced it or somebody has picked it.
You should check your room again! Do it properly.
Mother! I don't remember. sister Aliya is mad at me too.
She isn't mad! She is just worried.
You should look for it again.
I don't know mother.
I should tell about this to Kabir! It's important to tell him.
What is it? There's some problem everyday.
Ma'am!
yes
I want to tell you something.
maam Falak burned those clothes. I saw her do it last night.
Hello!
Kabir! Where are you!
I'm in office!
I want to meet you. I'm coming to your office.
Falak! Is everything fine?
Yes! Everything is fine. I want to talk to you.
Come! What is there to worry about?
Goodbye!
Sir! Sign here.
Did you tell everyone?
Yes sir! Everyone is informed.
The work load was more! So all executive level workers are given over time.
Good! Does anyone have objection?
Yes sir! Miss Navaal! She wants a leave.
Her sister's wedding is near.
No way! I can't give leave.
Work load is more! Tell the employees about it.
Right sir! As you wish.
Falak! Why are you crying?
What happened? Tell me!
Fine!
If you don't tell me! How would I know?
Here!
Tell me!
Stop crying!
The dress you bought for my wedding is misplaced.
Why are you crying? Here! Drink water.
It is something to cry! I told sister Aliya last night.
But today she checked the CCTV! Like she didn't believe.
Everyone is blaming me.
I'm not a kid that I'll misplace my wedding dress.
It's nothing! Just stop crying.
Control your tears and drink water.
sister Aliya came to house and she was interrogating me.
I felt so ashamed.
She went because she was mad. What will I wear on wedding?
Where will I get the dress from?
Falak! I think you are overreacting.
It's just a dress! We'll buy a new one.
It's a wedding! Obviously we have to arrange it.
You can go with sister Aliya! Buy a new dress. Simple!
I won't say anything to her! How can I?
How can I ask her for it again? I can't!
Fine! You should relax.
You should come with me for shopping!
Happy?
No! Leave it.
I'll ask sister Navaal for it! She'll find a way.
What is it? Why are you asking her?
In fact I would like it when you join me for shopping.
Trust me!
Please relax!
As you say!
This is what I'm talking about! Just smile.
Ma'am! I want to tell you something.
Speak!
Falak burned her wedding clothes last night.
I saw her with my eyes!
What are you saying? Are you mentally stable?
I'm totally fine! I saw her when I woke up last night to drink water.
You can see it yourself! Come with me.
Come!
Set your mood! Eat properly. Here!
Falak!
I don't want to see you crying.
What should I do? I couldn't understand.
Really? What about me?
I couldn't understand! How could I handle you?
How could I tell you? I was worried for you.
Who else would I tell?
Everybody was blaming me.
I thought that only you will understand me.
otherwise...  Kabir!
sister Aliya would think that I'm so immature.
I feel scared.
Falak! No need to be scared of sister Aliya.
I trust her that she has nothing in her heart for you.
That's why you shouldn't think like this.
Just relax!
OK?
Thank you!
Eat quickly! We are late. We took a lot of time for shopping.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Mother! Is everything fine? You look worried.
Yes! Everything is fine.
Tell me!
The dress that Falak lost.
Shaheen saw her burn it!
Falak burned it! After that..
She said that it's lost.
Why?
What is Shaheen saying?
Falak bought it herself! Why would she do such a thing?
I don't know anything!
Mother! You don't trust me? Why would I do such a thing?
It was my wedding dress! I chose it! Why would I burn it?
You are trusting her?
Let me call her.
Shaheen! Shaheen!
Yes ma'am?
Here! Did you see me burn the dress?
Ma'am! You were burning something.
I don't know if it was the wedding dress.
You saw me burning it?
Ma'am..
Why did you tell mother that Falak burned her wedding dress.
Mother! She is lying.
I was so worried.
I remember that when I reached home! I gave the bags to her.
She would've misplaced it and when she saw us finding it.
She would've burned it.
Ma'am! I didn't burn it.
Why would I burn your dress?
I don't know about it.
Don't trust her tears.
Call the police! She'll speak the truth in front of them.
Forgive me! I didn't see anything.
Just forgive me! Don't call police.
Call the police! She can steal anything big tomorrow. Just kick her out.
Get out! Don't come back to this house.
Get out!
Mother! I don't want to see her here again.
Mother! You trusted her over me? How can I do this?
Darling! I trust you. I was just worried.
Please mother.
Kabir! I was calling you. I was so worried.
My phone's battery was low! Phone was powered off.
Where were you?
I went to give my measurements for dress and shopping.
Who did you take for shopping.
I bought a new dress for Falak!
Is her mood alright?
Yes! It's fine.
I wanted to ask that what was the need for the investigating and the CCTV.
Checking the footage doesn't look right.
I just did it because I was worried for the dress.
Falak was worried! I went to see the CCTV for her.
But still Falak told that It's misplaced.
You should listen to her.
Actually! She was ashamed of herself.
Obviously! She is the daughter in law in this house. She was thinking that we will think bad for her.
I think that it was weird.
I didn't want her to feel ashamed.
I was just..
Kabir is right! You didn't need to do that.
I'm worried that Falak would be thinking bad about us.
Whatever happened! Forget it.
It's that she respects you a lot! She was thinking that you would be mad at her.
But I told her to keep her heart pure.
It's good that you told her!
If you call her! She'll like it and feel normal.
Fine! I'll go charge my phone.
Greetings!  
Greetings!
How are you, sir!
I'm fine! How are you?
Good!
Anything new?
Sir I'll show you! Sit please.
Show me something special.
Sure!
Here!
Should I serve you coffee?
Thank you! no need for formality.
It's good but..
It's not what I'm thinking.
You are not understanding. Something very unique for someone very special.
Sir! This is the best. Nobody has such designs.
Still! Do you having something very special?
I'll show you.
Sir! this is extremely unique.
This is the one.
Pack this one! Thank you!
Wow! I remembered her and she called.
Everything fine? You are feeling romantic.
Sir here!
Thank you so much.
I bought a special thing for a special person.
It'll remind her my love.
Tell me about it.
I can't tell! It's a surprise.
Kabir! It's bad. You told me half. I'll be worried.
I don't know! Show me.
Sure! let me take your worries off. I'm sending you the picture.
Sure! I'm waiting.
I talked to sister. I was ashamed.
OK!
I told you that we have separate ways.
But you told that you have forgiven me!
That doesn't mean that we are same like before.
I can't live without you.
I don't trust you Hamza!
You have left me before! You can do that again.
That's why I can't marry you.
Listen to me!
