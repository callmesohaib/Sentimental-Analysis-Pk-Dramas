They can't see me happy. I fear that they might do something to my child and still you won't do anything.
Falak!
Don't you dare raise your hand on my daughter?
For the peace of this house, someone has to leave this house.
If not you, then we should go.
To tell you the truth, I worry for my unborn child.
Whatever I'm doing I'm doing for my child. That's why I want to forget everything and start life anew.
I heard everything. She said that you created a lot of problems for her uncle.
That's why he left home and bought a new home.
You only have to cook for two people.
Why don't you make it? Until we hire a maid, you'll have to manage the housework.
Kabir, what's with you?
Kabir... give me a cheque before you leave, and I'll cash it.
A cheque, for what?
I told you I needed to buy a few things to decorate the house.
Falak, have patience, at least for a few days.
Why should I? I told you about this.
I've gotten what I wanted after a long time and you can't argue with me on this.
I want to do everything as per my desire.
How much money do you want?
Ten lacs.
Ten lacs... what will you do with that?
What can one even buy with ten lacs?
If you go to a branded shop you can't even buy curtains for ten lacs.
Give me the money and forget about it.
I need to buy things for my home.
Alright... I'm giving you my credit card, you can buy whatever you want. But not more than ten lacs.
I don't want a credit card...
do you want to keep an eye on me? Do you want to see what I purchased?
I don't want that. If you don't want to give me the money, then I don't. You don't trust me.
What kind of things are you saying? I didn't mean it that way at all.
Forget it.
Alright... I'll transfer the money to your account, okay?
Thank you.
Bye*
Looking at how busy I am in Canada I don't think I will be able to give you guys much time.
Looking at the current state of the market...
I don't think I will be able to be with you guys for long.
Hamza, I know that there are certain problems between us.
These problems are fixable if we talk about them.
I'm sorry Kabir.
I don't have much time. I have to look after my businesses in Canada and Pakistan.
That's why I've decided to remove all my shares from Kabir foods
My team in Pakistan will contact you in a few days and will discuss the rest of it,
Thank you
Ma'am, I thought you said that Hamza was with us.
He has decided to do this, but he hasn't followed through with it.
I'll talk to Hamza, you guys need not worry.
I want to assure you that Hamza will stay on board with us.
Do you know what will happen if Mr. Hamza isn't on board? We'll have a lot of loss.
Please don't panic... ups and downs are part of business.
It's okay... just remember...
that we won't let Hamza go.
Even if he leaves, what problem will we have?
Do you guys think we won't have an investor, another investor will take his place.
There are many investors in the market who are ready to come on board.
Yes... so... don't worry. Just calm down.
Congratulations on your new house.
Thank you very much.
Falak I missed you yesterday.
I was busy, you know how much work it takes during shifting.
Yes I know... we who live in rental homes know how hard it is to shift homes.
Don't worry, one day you will have your home.
Tell me... did you talk about the shoots? What did they say?
Yes... I did talk to the production houses.
But they can't shoot you today.... they are busy with the movie.
Then when?
I don't know... you were busy when they wanted you to shoot, now they're busy.
Tell them about my condition.
Falak, what's gotten into you... don't you dare say something like that?
Please don't tell them about their condition.
If they know about your condition, no one will cast you.
And your career will end. No one casts married models nowadays.
You're pregnant. If anyone knows about your pregnancy, they will cut you.
Alright, I'll do as you say. But still, talk to them, maybe they'll agree to it.
I'll talk to them.
Lord knows when fate will shine upon me...
don't worry... everything will be alright.
This is only for a few months.
After you're free, come to me. We'll start everything from where we left off.
Sister, if Hamza withdraws his shares, it will create huge problems for us.
Did you call him?
I did... he didn't pick up.
I don't understand what's with him.
He's taking such a major decision because of Sherazi.
He's not thinking about the good relationship that we have.
First, it was Umar Hayat and now it's Hamza.
Sister, we've lost all big investors in such a short span. If this keeps up... it will be a huge mess.
I'll think about it.
Tell me, how's Falak, is she fitting in her new home?
She's fine for now. We don't have a maid yet, I asked you to arrange one.
Yes, I did talk to her... she is at her village, she'll be here in a few days.
I need to go on a visit. I'll leave.
Sure sister.
I'll come home to meet my brother.
We'll see each other there.
Did you talk to Falak?
Yes... she's very happy. She's decorating her apartment.
She's insane... why does she want to trouble herself in her state?
I asked her the same thing and she answered...
that she's getting what she wants after such a long time, so I said, alright.
People have such veils over their faces... people like us can be easily fooled.
That's true.
Did you talk to Hamza? When are they coming?
No, I haven't talked to him in a while.
Really?
I'll Miss Sofia, let me ask her when he's coming back.
I was thinking of setting a date for your wedding as soon as Falak delivers the child.
Mother, Hamza said that brother Raheel's business is vast...
It will take time to wrap it up.
Anyways...
Alright... may everything be well.
I hope everything goes well.
Falak.
Falak.
Falak.
Falak.
Falak.
Falak.
Falak.
Hello...
Where are you Falak?
I'm with my friends... I'll be back shortly.
Have you gone insane Falak?
Come back right now... do you have any idea what the time is?
I'll be back in a while... farewell.
Will you have coffee sister?
No, thanks.
Why are you worried?
Sherazi... is talking about removing shares from the company as well.
What?
Who told you this?
Sherazi called, he mentioned this and hung up.
Impossible, I can't believe it. Are you sure it was Sherazi?
What are you saying? Of course, it was Sherazi.
I'll call and ask him...
I've tried he's not picking up.
Secretary is calling us for the meeting.
Sister, we have to stop him from doing this.
Hamza has already removed his shares and we've endured a great loss.
If Sherazi removes his shares, our business will collapse.
This has never happened before.
I'll talk to Sherazi and talk to him, how can he back off like this?
He's not picking up.
Hamza, you called me?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I believe that she should come to the office at least once a week.
There's paperwork that needs to be signed. It's getting hard for me.
Have you seen how she is... she can't even leave the house.
And the doctor has asked us not to give her stress.
She won't be able to do this, please manage.
Alright, a lot of my time is wasted going from one place to another.
Once she's there, it will help divert her mind.
Yes, you're right. But she won't be able to do this, right now.
Once she's mentally strong, then we'll think. Until then you have to support her.
Alright... as you wish.
I talked to her about going to Pakistan.
She refused to go.
I told her...
that you and I won't leave without her. We can't leave her here alone.
Forget it... if she doesn't want to go, then don't force her.
My dear... in her state, we can't leave her alone.
We need to take her back. Please... insist.
I was thinking about getting settled here.
When did this happen?
You said that once your sister's waiting period is over, you'll return, that your business was suffering.
When did you change your mind?
I had no idea about the market here.
When I've seen everything, I can see that there are a lot of opportunities here.
I can progress here much quicker. What I'll gain in years in Pakistan...
I can gain it here in months. I've thought long and hard about this decision.
That's a productive and progressive thought.
Both of you will have a good future. Both of you will earn in Canadian dollars.
But, before you do anything talk to Niwal.
You have to see how she feels. Maybe you've talked to her...
after that, you've decided this.
No, I haven't talked to her...
But, I will... she will do as I say...
I'm sure that she will support me.
Good...
I'll go and give your sister medicine.
Please don't put pressure on her, she's very disturbed.
Falak.
Falak...
Kabir, when did you get back?
Just now.
I had a headache and I went to sleep.
If you don't sleep at night, you're bound to get a headache.
Are you being sarcastic?
Not at all.
I'm telling you the truth. You came back at one in the morning.
I was furious, I didn't say anything because I wanted you to rest.
I tried to come back early, but you know how Anum is.
She's so stubborn, she kept stalling, that's why I was late.
Falak, more than her you should be concerned about your health.
You need to rest.
Alright... why are you lecturing me like a mother?
You can think of this as a lecture, or something else..
You will not stay out for so long again.
What's with you? Why are you putting restrictions on me?
Falak, if you don't take care of your health...
then I'll have to be strict.
Do you have any idea how many days have passed since we talked?
Three days... no sorry... it's been a week.
And in that week, I called you so many times and you didn't reply once.
I'm sorry... brother Raheel's business is vast, and I have to look after everything.
I've been so busy with it.
So busy that you can't even reply.
One can only be so busy when one wants to rid themselves of someone.
Or if there is someone new in their life.
What are you saying? Don't you trust me?
I trust you... but I'm afraid... if you're so busy now, then what will happen in the future?
I understand your fears.
If you understand, wind up the business and come back.
You have a business here as well, which is suffering in your absence.
Yes.
Hamza... what's the matter? You look worried.
No.. it's nothing.
Is your sister well?
Yes... she's better than before.
Then what? Why does it seem to me that you want to say something, but can't?
I want to say it but now is not the time. I'll talk to you later.
You're worrying me... tell me, what is the matter?
It's nothing... I was just teasing you. Don't you think if were something, I would have told you?
You scared me.
I'll call you after a while... bye...
Why didn't you tell her? You should have listened to her response.
No, not now. I think if I talk to her now, she won't be able to understand.
You already have a lot of misunderstandings in your relationships.
If you don't communicate properly then these misunderstandings will only increase.
Look... relationships are more important than business and money...
it's best that you talk to her now.
Avoid the problems that you might have.
I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and that will never end.
I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
Mr. Danish... don't act like a stranger. I'll talk to Mr. Sherazi.
Yes... he's with us, don't worry.
Farewell
What's the matter? All good?
After Hamza, Sherazi has removed his shares from our company as well.
Everyone is worried... I don't know what's happening.
Talk to them... no one would do this without reason.
Talk to them and find out what the reason is.
There was a fight going on between Sherazi and Hamza...
I didn't know that, and that is the mistake that I made.
If we hadn't made Sherazi invest, then Hamza would have been with us today.
Then talk to Hamza...
Don't you think I already tried talking to him?
He's a weird man... he doesn't care about his loss or ours.
Greetings*
Come sit.
How are you?
I'm well... how are you settling into your new home?
Not now... but I will soon.
I'm so sorry, I need to take this, excuse me.
Sister... I think that he's doing all this to bother us on purpose...
He will blackmail us and try to take advantage of our compulsion.
I don't think so... because he knows that he won't gain anything by this
That's why Mr. Danish is worried as well.
it is worrying
Where will we make up for such a loss?
Looking at the market and our circumstances, no one would be willing to invest with us.
Hello... is Mr. Kabir there?
Miss Falak, it's you! How are you?
I'm fine, answer what I'm asking. Is Mr. Kabir there?
Yes, he's here.
To tell you the truth, I can't think of anything to get us out of this.
I've never faced such a situation before.
Two big investors have left at once
Anyways...
God is our savior... don't be disappointed.
We'll talk with Mr. Sherazi and let's see what he says...
It's late... I think you should leave Kabir.
Look... right now Falak needs your love and attention.
Ups and downs occur in business, but this should not affect your home.
Try and keep Falak happy.
Yes, sister... I understand.
Kabir... where were you? I've been calling you for ages. I was starving!
There isn't anything inside the kitchen or the fridge.
I'm so sorry... I forgot. I'll do one thing tomorrow...
I'll buy some groceries and fruit.
Where were you?
Why weren't you picking up my calls?
I went to visit sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir...
I was starving here and you were over there talking to them.
What's with you... I was talking to them.
I went there to discuss some business problems.
Kabir, what are the problems that you can't solve at the office and you have to go there at night?
Why are you looking at me like that? I haven't asked anything wrong.
Wait a minute!
We might have shifted here, but that doesn't mean that we have no association with that house.
You chose to come here.
I didn't force you to come here.
I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and it will always stay that way.
I can never end that relationship.
I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
Are you punishing me by keeping me here alone?
It's my mistake, right? I wait for you all day so that we can eat together.
I want to talk to you as well... but you don't have time.
I am the wrong one... what difference does it make to you?
Falak... listen... I'm sorry.
I was worried... my mobile was on silent... I didn't know
I'll try to come early tomorrow.
Leave it...
Alright, stop being upset... let's do one thing...
Let's have dinner at a nice place.
Why? Did sister Aliyah not ask you for dinner?
She asked me... but I said that I would have dinner with my wife.
Did you eat something?
I'll get ready.
Excuse me... tell Mr. Sherazi...
I have, he's in a meeting and will ask for you when he comes.
Yes, but we've been here for half an hour waiting for him. Tell him one more time.
Okay sir, I'll tell him.
Yes...
Sir... Kabir and Aliyah are waiting for you, what shall I say to them?
Let them wait... they'll leave.
Okay, sir.
Don't send them in.
Okay.
Sir... I've told Mr. Sherazi... he'll ask for you two when he's free.
Okay, thank you.
Self-respect and dignity are a thing as well.
Let's go...
No sister.
We'll find an investor somewhere.
If not him, then someone else. But we can't degrade ourselves by sitting here.
You're right, let's go.
Falak, what's the matter? Look at the state of the home. Are you feeling well?
I'm not... I have to do everything here. I can't do it.
Why? Is there no maid?
How can you work in your state?
Kabir said that he'd find a maid in two days.
But she isn't here! I think he's just making excuses.
Kabir has gone insane! Is this the reason he brought you here?
Let him come... I'll set him straight.
Calm down, mother. I'll find someone for her, until then I'll do it.
Don't worry my dear, we are here to care for you.
The fight between Hamza and Sherazi has dealt us a major blow.
I don't know why... somewhere...
it seems to me that I'm the one responsible for this.
Why are you holding yourself responsible?
Because...
trusting someone so much can cause a person to lose.
Especially in business, one must keep eyes and ears open.
I don't know how I missed something like this. I didn't anticipate it.
Yes?
Mr. Wahab is here to meet you.
Take him to the conference room, I'll be right there.
Sister... let me go to this meeting.
Sure.
What will you have Mr. Wahab? Tea... coffee?
Nothing... look, I'm busy as well as you. So better than wasting time...
we should talk about business.
Sure, please...
We have a very old working relationship.
That's why I'm talking to you in a very calm manner.
But... the check that we got from your company has bounced.
I haven't paid the labor this month. After the check bounced if I wanted...
I could have filed a complaint against you. But I didn't think it was appropriate.
Thank you so much for that, and I apologize that you had to face this difficulty because of us...
But you know there is a crisis nowadays...
I don't know anything...
If you guys don't pay me... I'll remove all the labor that is working in your hotels.
I have many other offers. The laborers will work where they will get paid.
No, you have to decide.
If you don't want this, then all dues must be cleared by the end of the month.
You've left me no option.
Kabir, who are you talking to? What happened?
I'm calling Hamza.
Why right now? You can call him in the morning.
I'm calling him because it's something important.
If you're tired, go to sleep. I'm worried.
How would I know that you're worried? It won't come to me in a dream.
You don't share anything with me... tell me what happened.
Hamza and Sherazi have removed their shares from the company.
We've lost millions.
Hamza has removed shares?
He's a family member, he shouldn't have done this. Did you talk to him?
That's the thing... he didn't care about the relationship.
We have to suffer the consequences of the fight between Hamza and Sherazi...
Don't worry...
I'll talk to sister Niwal... she'll try to make him understand.
 What can we expect from strangers if our blood does this?
He should not be doing this to us.
No Falak... there is no need for you to talk to Niwal.
I don't want to involve her in this matter.
Don't think too much about it. I'll talk to her in my way and make her understand.
No... forget it... there's no need for you to talk to her.
I'll manage this somehow.
Go to sleep.
Somewhere, I think I'm the one to blame for this.
All this is happening because of me.
If you trust someone more than you should... can be detrimental... especially in business.
One should keep their eyes and ears open.
If you guys don't pay me... I'll remove all the labor that is working in your hotels.
Excuse me, sir... Mr. Ahsan has been waiting for you for the past hour.
Cancel the meeting... I'm not feeling well. I'm going home.
Sir, they provide us with spices...
There are some problems with the rates, this meeting is important.
Are you the boss, or I am?
I said to cancel the meeting.
Thank you, sir.
What is this insanity? You have a meeting with Mr. Ahsan... 
everyone's payment has been halted for a week now.
I won't be able to do it.. please attend the meeting...
Look Kabir..
In business, you have to take these kinds of stress.
There's a crisis that doesn't mean that we should run away.
The business is ours and we have to face everything.
Come on... let's go for the meeting, get up.
Did you have Mr. Wahab paid?
Half of it is sent and the rest of it will be sent as well... don't worry.
This month he won't bother us... we need some time to get out of this.
One time we're out of this... we will forget the hard times we are having.
Come on... we've already made him wait half an hour.
What are you saying? Hamza didn't tell me anything.
He is good friends with Kabir, why would he withdraw his shares?
Because of Sherazi... he said that he endured a loss because of their fight.
Because of Sherazi?
Sister, talk to Hamza.
Ask him not to withdraw his shares. 
You know how hard Kabir has worked for this company
He works day and night. He's worried.
Will you talk to Hamza?
I will.
You'll have to convince him. He won't ignore what you say... he loves you.
Please sister... for me...
Don't worry... I'll do something.
