They are very nice people. They have a beautiful house and everything is wonderful.
If God wills, my daughter will have a wonderful fate.
my daughter will stay very happy
I just couldn't move my eyes. Isn't mom?
Everything was wonderful. The house was so big.
My house is nothing as compared to it.
sister Nawal you're very lucky you're going to such a good house.
I'd say you should groom yourself too. They'll come for the betrothal ceremony soon.
Look at the way you live. Its very important. There's a huge difference between theirs and our status.
That's why I'm saying you should groom yourself before you get married so that you don't have any problem later.
She has been working for a long time and running this house.
My daughter is very confident and sensible.
You'll see, she'll adjust easily.
You're absolutely right. I agree but still she'll have to think about herself.
She'll go with me for shopping now.
You will not shout and you'll have to get whatever I say, wear it and stay like that.
Nawal, go shopping with her in a day or two. Shop for your engagement too.
Alright fine. I'll go.
Now both of your sisters, sit and talk. God has listened to my prayers.
I'll go offer prayers of gratitude.
Your house is very beautiful. everything seems to be branded. It looks as if you have imported everything.
Yes, mostly everything is imported.
This is a small gift for you.
What are you looking at?
I'm looking at this necklace.
You see and tell me how much its worth.
Falak, don't judge a present by its worth but the love of the person gifting it.
But still tell me what its worth.
It must be worth millions. Hamza gifted it to you. He doesn't give away cheap presents.
But why are you asking?
Its nothing. I was just setting my jewelry and I set eyes upon it so I brought it here.
I'll keep it back.
Hmm..
Hello?
Thank you Nawal for giving me the biggest happiness in my life.
Why are you quiet? won't you say something?
I said yes, isn't it enough?
Nawal, did you make this decision yourself or did someone pressurize you?
I made this decision myself. It was a difficult decision,
but then I thought only human beings make mistakes and its only sensible to forgive.
Trust me Nawal, I'll never break your trust again.
I will not repeat the mistake again.
Mam, Nawal?
Mam is calling you for dinner.
Alright. You go ahead and I'll come.
Listen mom is calling me for dinner. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Nasreen
Keep them. You'll tell me whatever Aaliya does, whoever she talks to. Especially when she talks to Kabeer.
Alright mam. I've Understood.
Keep this.
Thank you mam.
Do as I told you. Keep an eye on her.
Don't worry mam.
Go and do your work now.
maam you!
Nasreen, who gave you this money?
Actually. I didn't steal, mam.
Tell me the truth. Don't lie.
I swear.
I heard and saw everything. Come with me now.
You've been working with us for years, we took care of you and you forgot your loyalty today.
Whats happening?
What nonsense is this?
Touqeer look at this. Falak gave money to Nasreen to spy on me.
What?
Yes. I heard them talking.
How could she! Nothing like this has ever happened in our house.
I will not tolerate anyone trying to shake the foundations of my house.
Nasreen, what is she saying?
Is this true that Falak gave you money to spy on her?
Tell him.
I'm asking you something, answer me.
brother Touqeer, I gave her the money for her sick husband.
I have no idea why you're looking at my good deeds with suspicion.
What did I do? Why are you doing this?
Falak, you will not lie once again.
I've heard and seen everything myself. The mask has fallen off your face.
Enough Aaliya. Don't you have to show face to God? Why are you hurling false accusations at me?
If her husband was sick, why didn't she mention it to me?
So what if she mentioned to me? I will not shout out the good deeds I do.
You have made a habit of creating a spectacle, no matter what I do. You think I'm always wrong.
Please Aaliya. Nasreen go away. Go.
Aaliya is Aaliya but Touqeer, do you also think I'm capable of this?
Falak, this isn't how it is.
I'm sure, Aaliya has a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding happens once, not every time.
She insults me every time. Such cheap tactics. Don't worry, we'll leave this house very soon
Falak..
Touqeer she's playing games with me.
Enough. Aaliya enough is enough. Just let it go, okay.
I was thinking why shouldn't we have the engagement next week?
We need a week to make arrangements.
Alright. If you find this date feasible, we have no objections.
Fantastic. Congratulations. May God bless our children with a good fate.
Ameen
Listen, be ready. We'll go shopping tomorrow.
Aunty.. Please get whatever you want to buy for me.
Nawal, I only have one son and I have always kept this in my heart. I want to shop for his wedding, I want to dance
and now you'll accompany me on shopping everyday.
Shopping everyday?
Yes. Everyday and you'll not say No to me.
You should come along.
No. You should take Nawal along. You have double responsibility.
Nazish is not here. Had she been here, she would have taken you.
Now see, I'll have to fulfill the responsibility of a mother and sister in law both.
Wow Falak. You've been very intelligent. Aaliya, I'll not let you win so easily.
I'll throw your sensibility on your face. You'll see.
Falak, what happened?
Ask me what didn't happen? I shouldn't have come back.
But what happened, why are you crying?
Again a drama. Aaliya created another drama to show me down and now she has Nasreen along.
She insulted me in front of her.
I gave Nasreen money for her sick husband and Aaliya said that I gave her money to spy on her.
You tell me, why would I do that? I don't understand why is Aaliya after my life.
Why is Aaliya behaving like this?
She was never like this.
What should I do Kabeer? Should I go somewhere or kill myself?
I've tried everything to make her clean her heart but she doesn't come to that.
Alright. Calm down. Don't worry. I'll talk to Aaliya and make her understand. She'll understand.
Kabeer if she has a problem with me, we'll leave from here. At least she'll be at peace.
What are you saying Falak? How can we leave home and go?
I can never think about it.
Even I don't want such a thing Kabeer but the situation at home,
What is all this? Nobody is at peace. Even Touqeer is upset with me. I cannot tolerate all this Kabeer.
Falak, look here. Relax and sit.
We'll think about it. Please stop crying. You don't look good crying.
I'm here with you. Don't worry.
I'm tired of this chaos everyday.
I'm telling you I'm with you.
Trust me. I heard everything with my own ears.
You have a phobia with Falak. You're always thinking about her.
Sometimes what you see or hear is wrong as well.
How can I make you trust me? She isn't as innocent as she seems.
I'm amazed at your thinking.
You have started domestic politics like typical middle class women.
Aaliya you're an educated, sensible woman.
This doesn't suit you. This is upsetting.
Did you see? You will get nothing having a tussle with me.
If you put up resistance in my way, you'll suffer yourself.
Lies don't have feet. It won't stay hidden for long. One day everybody will know.
The truth is that you're just mistaken and its not a good thing.
I don't want bad for anyone. Why would I want it for you as well?
Do whatever you want to. One day the mask will fall off your innocent face.
I will not let this happen.
No way, you will not be able to govern me like you govern this house.
I will not let this happen.
Please have something.
No. I'm stuffed.
Hello aunty. You here?
Hello dear. How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you my dear? Sit down.
Actually I was here to pick Nawal up. We're going for shopping.
Alright. I,
sister Nawal..
When did you come?
Just now.
I came for you. I thought I'd take you shopping but I saw aunty is here.
I kept telling her to get whatever you like but she insisted that Nawal's choice was a must.
Of course. She must chose her dresses herself since she'll be wearing them.
Now should we leave Nawal?
Yes. Sure.
Okay.
Alright. I'll leave now. I came for you. Since aunty is here, you can go with her.
No. You come along. It'll help Nawal.
Yes. Come along.
If you're insisting, I'll come along. Otherwise I was thinking I'd go back home.
Since Aaliya leaves for work, I have to look after the house.
Oh. If you're busy, I'll take Nawal along, it isn't a problem.
No aunty. I'll come along. I don't want to break Nawal's heart.
Alright. Lets go then. Bye. Come along everyone.
What does Aaliya do, who she talks to, especially when she's talking to Kabeer, stay nearby.
Don't worry mam.
I gave her the money for her sick husband but I didn't realize that you'll misunderstand my good deeds as well.
What did I do? Why are you doing this?
You have a phobia named Falak. You're always thinking about her.
Aaliya sometimes what we see isn't what it is. Why don't you get that?
I am amazed at your thinking.
You have started domestic politics just like typical middle class women.
Mom? What happened?
Nothing dear. Nothing.
Why are you crying? Dad is upset with you. Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
This is nice. Lovely color. What do you think Nawal?
Yes, its pretty.
Its good but the stuff is very light.
Light? Really?
Oh my God, this is so high priced?
Oh. Don't worry about the price. If you like it, we'll buy it.
We'll see something else.
Don't you like it? If not we'll see something somewhere else.
Oh, my God. This is such a beautiful color. Look at the embroidery. Its so beautiful. Lovely Nawal.
Look at this. do you like it?
Yes aunty. Your choice is very nice. Its better than the last one.
Nawal, what do you think?
If you like it, we'll buy it.
Dear, you'll be wearing it. Tell me honestly, do you like it?
Its very beautiful but its expensive.
Dear don't look at the price tag. Anything for my future daughter in law.
Listen, pack this one. Its lovely. We're getting it. come, we'll see something else.
Fariha aunty. When did you come from London?
Oh Aaliya, you..
How are you?
I'm absolutely fine. I've been here from London since long. Its good to see you.
Same.
Meet her. This is Saleha, my friend.
Hello.
This is Aaliya. She's the owner of Kabeer Foods.
Sultana's younger daughter married Kabeer, her brother in law. Sultana and Aaliya are related.
All praise to the Lord. Nawal is a very good girl.
Not Nawal. Falak. Her younger daughter married Kabeer.
As far as we know, Nawal is the only child of Sultana. Falak is her servant's daughter.
I think you're mistaken. Sultana has two daughters.
I'm not mistaken. Sultana only has one daughter, Nawal.
Falak is her domestic servant Sabir's daughter. Tell her Fariha. Didn't you tell her?
Didn't Sultana tell her?
Falak is Sultana's daughter. She brought her up.
What are you saying?
Fariha, what do you mean she brought her up.
I don't understand why are we discussing this here. This is between Sultana and her family.
This is my family matter as well.
We should discuss family matters at home. Its better that way.
Leave everything and lets meet other people.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Why did you have to say this?
Listen. Where is Falak?
She is in her room.
Oh wow. I think you really like me.
That's why you're always asking about me.
Didn't I tell you?
I'll find the truth to your lies one day.
What do you mean? What lies?
You know everything so stop flying and come back to Earth.
Do you know, ever since you started your cheap tactics in this house, I understood that there was something wrong.
But I didn't know everything would be wrong.
Your attitude, your hobbies, whatever you did.
I had an idea you were never Nawal's sister and now,
I know your truth. Since I know everything so..
What do you mean? What truth?
That you're not Sultana's daughter but the daughter of his servant.
Shut up with your nonsense.
Will you say whatever comes in your heart?
Shouting will get you nothing. You'll suffer if you shout.
So you think you'll pressurize me to be proven correct?
This isn't a lie.
You people lied to us. You cheated us.
The person who told me everything is not an outsider but a person from your family.
I don't believe this 
that you'll hate me so much that you'll want to make me fall in Kabeer's eyes by questioning my existence.
I'm sad for you. 
Let Touqeer and Kabeer come. We'll make a decision today.
Yes, let them come. They should also know,
that the person we thought was a diamond, turned out to be coal.
Enough. I'll not tolerate any more accusations.
What proof do you have?
I'll give the proof when things come out in the open.
I'll see, who is telling you to say all this. Prove that I'm not Sultana's daughter.
Who will believe you? Touqeer? Kabeer? Nobody will trust you.
And if you say such a thing to me next time, I'll not spare you. You'll remember.
I'll do whatever it takes you to bring your truth to the surface.
I will now rest when you're out of this house and Kabeer's life.
Why not? We'll see who throws whom out and from where.
I'll question Sultana why did she lie to us. Why did she keep us in the dark?
Why not? Go and cross check because you'll lose this time as well. You know this.
Should I go now?
Didn't I tell you, I'll find the truth to your lies. 
Your attitude, your habits showed you were never Nawal's sister.
You are not Sultana's daughter but her servant's.
Let Touqueer and Kabeer come. We'll decide today.
Of course. Let them come. They should also know that the diamond we brought was only coal.
No matter what I have to do, I'll do what it takes to throw you out of this house and Kabeer's life.
Oh God. If Kabeer finds out, it'll be a mess.
Aaliya, I'll destroy you. You'll remember me forever.
 You want to throw me out of this house. You'll see what I do with you.
Nawal is Sultana's only daughter. Falak is her servant's daughter.
Sultana, did you tell her about Falak's true identity?
What are you saying?
You shouldn't hide it.
What do you want to tell?
Mom? Mom? Mom?
Falak, what happened? Sit here. Nawal..
Nawal.. What happened tell me?
What happened why is she crying?
I don't know, she's only crying and not telling me anything.
Falak tell me what happened? If you don't tell us, how will we know?
Aaliya knows everything. She threatened me that she'll tell everyone.
What does she know? Tell me.
That I'm not your real daughter.
Who told her?
I don't know.
I don't know how she knows. She didn't like me and now she'll tell me. I'll lose my home.
Nothing will happen.
Don't worry. We'll talk to her. Mom will talk to her. Don't cry yourself.
Please promise me, no matter what happens you'll not tell them the truth.
Don't tell anyone. My house will be destroyed. Kabeer will leave me if he finds the truth.
Falak, no matter what happens, you're my real daughter and Nawal's younger sister.
Mom, why don't you believe me? Nobody will believe this.
No. Promise me, you'll not tell anyone. Swear upon me. Just tell me you'll not tell anyone.
Yes dear. I'll not tell anyone.
Relax now.
Falak don't worry. We're with you.
Be quiet.
Mom, I'll leave. Kabeer will be home soon.
Wait. Look at your condition.
Mom, Kabeer must be home soon, I don't want him to know anything.
Falak, listen to me. Falak..
Kabeer.. What is it?
Is Hafsa asleep?
Yes I put her to bed. 
What is it? Are you worried?
Brother whatever is happening in the house, its worrying me. 
I don't understand what should I do,
that we'll get the peace back in our house and we live like we used to. With love.
Don't worry.
I have talked to Aaliya. I've made her understand. Nothing will happen
I love Falak very much.
I cannot think about leaving her or living away from her.
Just think of it is as that I'm because of her and Aaliya,
I respect and care for her very much. Everybody knows that. 
In fact I hold her in place of my mother.
And brother, its because of Aaliya, that Falak came in this house. Its because of her that she's in my life.
Whatever I am today, I wouldn't have been successful without Aaliya's help.
Brother, can it not happen that Aaliya forgets all misunderstandings and we live peacefully in this house again?
Don't worry. You'll see whatever you want will happen.
I have talked to them both. Both of them are sensible, they'll understand and as it is,
it is for the best for this house. 
Let me call Aaliya. We'll talk to her in front of her.
Aaliya?
Yes I'm coming.
Please sit. I want to talk to you.
Please sit.
Yes tell me.
Falak?
Yes?
Where were you?
I was calling you, your phone was off.
Yes, the battery.
Alright. Please come, sit here. We're discussing something important.
Please sit.
Aaliya, whatever problems we have in the house, whatever is going on in the house, we all know.
Whatever misunderstandings and complaints that you and Falak have with one another, can you not end all that?
Can it not happen that we live peacefully like earlier?
What is it Aaliya? Will you not say anything?
Aaliya you only say that if you want to shake the foundations of a house,
we should build walls of misunderstandings. 
Kabeer wants to knock those walls down.
Whatever is in your heart, take it out. Everything.
Toqueer there is nothing in my heart. My heart is all clean of the past. 
In fact, I respect Aaliya a lot. I think of her as my sister.
And I promise you people, I will not create any problems in this house.
I love Falak very much. I cannot think about leaving her or living away from her.
If both of you want the same thing, alright then.
 I'll try to forget whatever happened in the past.
Thank you so much, Aaliya. Falak, thank you.
Aaliya, my heart was burdened and it was difficult to live in the house like this.
It would be great if we can live peacefully like we used to.
