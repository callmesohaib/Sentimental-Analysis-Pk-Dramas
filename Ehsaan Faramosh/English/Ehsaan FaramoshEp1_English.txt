Cake!
That's what I'm talking about! Perfect!
Wow! Amazing!
You did a nice decor Falak! You changed the look of this room.
Yes mother! I spent some time on it. It had to look good.
Hey listen! Do what I told you to do.
Shut down some lights and make some noise outside the room of sister Naval!
No! Just break the vases near her room.
Hey! What are you saying? It's expensive.
Then what mother? It's not expensive than your daughters. Go and do it. Go!
Nothing is wrong! How do you feel?
I feel good! You are so naughty!

You remember my birthday?
Obviously! You are the only person in this world whose birthday I remember.
Thank you!
Stay happy and stay safe! Lots of love!

Mother! You knew it too but you didn't let me realize.
Falak wanted to surprise you! How could I tell?
Why are we standing! Mother! Let's cut the cake! Come!
Where are you going?
I'm getting ready for the office! You should do your breakfast quickly. I'll drop you to the university.
No! Wait! I'm not going to the university today! Neither are you going to your office.
Why?
That's because today is your birthday and we will celebrate it together and spend some time together.
Listen! We can do it after official timings. I have an important meeting in the office.
Nothing is important! I've told the administration of your office that you are sick!
No Falak! You are joking! You are joking, right? Mother! Is she joking?
No! I'm not joking! I knew it that you'll go to office.
That's why I have called your office and settled everything.
You are so naughty! You shouldn't lie!
It's not wrong to lie for your happiness.
No! One shouldn't lie at all.
But why don't you stop? It's your birthday today and a good day.
Spend your day with us! You are getting this chance after such a long time.
Yes! Now you should give us a treat in a 5 star restaurant.
Check the demands.

Really?
I love you!

Good morning! I got your favorite omelet fried for you.
Thank you sister in law! Hey!
Do you remember? We have a meeting at 11.
You are speaking like you want to settle a score for your own self! I'll be there before you!
My wife was a great housewife! Now she is a business woman.
I didn't do anything! She is already a business woman.
In fact if she wasn't my partner in business. I wouldn't be so successful.
Wow! You say the truth.
It is the truth but somebody is being jealous.
Hey! It's an honest confession. My heart did feel jealous.
See! It took me 10 years to develop my real estate business.
But still I didn't get that much of profit compared to your business.
I'm actually really happy for you guys.
Look at the team! Do you have such a team?
You are right! You both are intelligent and legible for business.
Team work bro! Team work! Me and sister in law are not just good at business but really good at handling house matters.
I do understand and I'm proud of both of you!
I have to go on a visit in the evening!
I have to choose the curtains for the 1st floor too.
I'm thinking that I might need your help!
I shared details with periments for Hafsa's birthday! Talk to them about the budget! I won't have the time.
Don't worry! You have to rest when you reach home. I'm scared that you might get sick because you work so hard.
She won't!
You know that sister in law doesn't feel easy if she doesn't arrange the kitchen herself.
Exactly!
You both don't eat until I make it!
He has a point!
Hey! Your birthday is near! Do you have a good mood or bad mood for the school?
Good mood!
Uncle! The milk isn't finished.
What? You haven't finished your milk? Drink it!
Congratulations to you all! We are opening a new branch.
This branch is successful because of..
Sister in law!

We enjoyed a lot! Now I'm tired and I'll rest. You guys should go and rest too.
Sister! I needed some cash. It's for the notes I need for final exams.
I sent 20k in the start of month to your account.
It's the mid of the month Falak!
Sister! You know that in university a person has huge expense but I still try to manage.
Like I never went to the university!
Please give it! I try my best to handle the expense but sometimes I fail.
Sure!
10k!
10K?
I just bought you a new Ipad! I'm going out of budget.
You might think that I'm a burden!
What happened Falak? Why do you think like this?
Sometimes I think that I'm a burden.
But I know that you care for me and you'll never let me lose anything.
You are my sister! My sister is never a burden.
You are really nice sister! I love you!
You know? I've decided that after my last semester and exams, I'll find myself a nice job!
I'll start the job! I won't ever disturb you. I'll take care of my expense.
You said this in front of me the last time. You should only focus on one thing.
You should work on your studies and score high grades. Don't think about the job. I earn!
I earn for you guys! Don't worry!
If you ask me a hundred times! I won't mind.
Sister! Can I take your car tomorrow?
I have office tomorrow and I have to buy some books from a bookstore too.
You can use cab! I need it for only one day sister. Please!
Sure! But no speeding! Drive carefully.
OK! Promise!
Remember on more thing! Come back early because tomorrow we have invited uncle and aunt as guests.
Fine! I promise that I'll come after class.
Good girl! You should rest!
Can any person change their colors so fast?
I cannot believe that you have changed so much.
I am feeling proud of you! You've maintained this house so well after I left.
You are right! Tell me one thing!
How do you manage everything? I am always busy with household but I cannot manage it so well.
How do you do this?
If you ask me the truth! This is all because of Navaal.
She has handled the whole house herself and I don't need to maintain it myself!
Greetings uncle! Greetings aunt! How are you?
Greetings! How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine!
Wow! Your mother was appreciating you and I'm very happy!
How was your journey? Did you come comfortably?
It's was fine! I just need to rest.
Where's Falak? Isn't she back?
I called her! She told me that she is on the way!
She is irresponsible! I told her to come early.
Oh god! What did you do?
Madam! Forgive me! I was going straight! You came in reverse direction.
Are you flying an airplane on road? What about this damage now?
Madam! I'm a poor man! I'm the driver of this car.
How can I manage your damage? I'm poor!
What are you looking at? Move it!
Yes madam!
Poor?
Hello!
Falak! Where are you? You haven't reached!
Navaal! I had an accident.
Accident?
What happened? Where are you Falak?
Are you fine? Are you injured?
Yes! I'm fine! There's nothing serious! The car has a little dent.
Where are you? Send me your location! I'm coming!
No! No need to come! I'm on my way.
Sure! Come quickly!
I'm coming!
Is she fine? Is she injured?
No! She is totally fine!
Thank god!
Are you mad?
You are getting so worried about a maid's daughter? You have given her a car?
Hey! She is not the daughter of maid! She is my daughter!
I don't like your misjudging!
She is right! making stranger a daughter is something else.
Yes! I have adopted her.
I think of her as my own child!
What happens if you think? Reality is reality! Your own blood is your own.
Aunt! Falak is my sister!
I don't like when someone calls her daughter of maid!
Call her and ask where she is?
Falak! Is everything alright? Are you injured?
Yes mother! I'm fine! It's just a normal accident.
I've told you so many times to drive carefully!
Nothing happened! It was not my fault! He was a poor driver. He asked for forgiveness. Greetings!
Greetings!
How are you guys? When did you come?
We are here from sometime!
Can any person change their colors so quick?
I cannot even believe that you've changed so much!
Hey! She is my daughter.
She is the younger sister of Navaal! Why are you speaking like this?
You should just stop sometimes.!
What did I say?
Sultana! Don't mind!
I added a lot of chilies in the dinner today. I thought you wouldn't eat so much.
Everything was perfect!
You always make good food! Today it was great. I ate too much.
The food was so good! I really need green tea! With honey and lemon!
You'll be blamed if I get fat!
I've decided! I need to find a beautiful girl for you to marry.
So that she comes and makes good food!
You appreciate her! Blame her for your fatness. What do you say Tauqeer?
I'm saying that from long time! He doesn't listen.
I was talking about food! What's with my marriage?
Tell me! Do you like any girl?
You know it better that I'm not into love.
I like this after marriage!
A man should be loved by his wife!
You still need a girl for that! We are asking if you have met someone already!
You are always outside and enjoying! Don't tell me that you've never met a girl that you felt interested in!
You thought about marriage!
You both know my daily routine!
Office from home and back!
I just have lunch or dinner sometimes.
I'm asking about friends!
Exactly! Just like I met her in my university.
My first and last love!
OK!
My first love..
My business!
Done!
Exactly!
I should tell you that if this happens then he'll never marry!
You should find a girl for him yourself and do everything quickly! That's the only way!
I'll wear some fancy suits and enjoy a lot! I'll do dances too!
You've started planning already!
The celebration has started.
We just have to find a girl.
Really? Which song will you sing?
Can any person change so quick?
Looks and get up is changed.
I cannot believe!
Where are you? Here!
This is your grocery! Sent by sir!
May god keep them happy! They care for us.
You are right! These people are running the world properly.
You remember we were in hard times.
Thank god I found job! Sir cares for us too!
I'll work hard!
So that they stay happy from us.
God gave us a gift for patience! We did something good that we got such people in return.
We would've been in hardships our whole life.
We would've had the worst life.
You are right! We didn't even have a supporting blood relation.
We are servants.
Enough! Don't cry like this. Sit here with me.
You shouldn't cry like this. You are a good girl.
Father told me that her parent's have passed away!
Yes! That's why she'll stay with us.
You'll keep her in your room!
She makes noise! I won't allow her in my room.
Don't say like that! If Falak doesn't stay with u then she has to go to orphanage.
And you always wanted a younger sister! You'll find a new sister.
Falak! Will you become the younger sister of Navaal?
Great!
OK mother! Come Falak! I'll show you my toys.
Falak!
Mother is calling! Come! Uncle and aunt are going. You should meet them.
I didn't like it! Tell mother.
What do people get from hurting other people?
Don't get hurt by what they say. You know they say whatever the have on their tongue.
This is not my wrong! That I was born in a poor family.
Is this really my fault that I was a child of servants?
Why are you thinking about this?
If you feel hurt by the sayings of people then you'll make your life hard.
Listen! Get fresh and come down.
Don't let them know that you are hurt by their words.
You know the rule! Don't act emotional in front of them.
Now come!
You are goings so early!
You know it better that a person can sleep properly in their own house.
We'll keep visiting!
Sure! I'll go check on Navaal.
Fine!
Navaal! What are you doing? They are leaving.
Mother! I winding up.
Looks like you are hurt by our words.
Yes aunt! I felt hurt for a little bit.
I told my heart that some people exist in this world who are not happy for people. I felt better after that.
What is this way of talking?
Stay in your limits.
You should too!
It's just that she has adopted you!
You know it better that you would've never seen such life.
You are being fed as a snake!
Aunt! I'm just lucky!
And luck brought me here!
just see that I'm seeing you off so disrespectfully.
Be careful!
You are so disrespectful. Nobody should talk to you.
Sultana! Where are you!
Quick!
Yes?
I was just packing somethings.
What was the need for this? We ate properly!
Keep this for my happiness!
Sure! Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Greetings!   Greetings!
I'm so tired!
Thank you!
Mother! Did you go somewhere outside?
Yes! I went to Mrs. Ahsan.
Why?
Mother! Do you remember about Anaya's mehndi?
We are invited! It's must!
I remember! Her parents came to invite us.
What are you wearing?
I'll wear anything! She has the problem.
Yes!
It's obvious! Anaya is a good friend to me. 
I'm way to excited for her marriage. I've practiced some dances too.
I'll wear a designer suit!
Good! Just bring a nice looking dress. That will make you happy.
Oh! Navaal!
Mrs. Ahsan was saying that there a nice proposal for Navaal!
The boy is a foreign national. He is a business man and belongs to a good family. He is well educated.
He'll take his wife to foreign too! I was thinking to invite them over here.
We'll see the boy too!
Wow mother! Invite them over here on this weekend. Navaal will finally get married. We'll have fun.
No! Not at all. You'll invite no one. I don't want to marry anyone.
Why not? When the boy is well settled. He belongs to a nice family. Why don't you want to marry?
I still have to do a lot! Marriage isn't in my plans.
I'll think after sometime.
Mother! If she doesn't marry! You should get me married.
I won't disagree.
Yes! Get her married.
No! You are elder.
She is young! You'll get married before! I'll arrange her marriage after you.
Sure! Just don't force me. Let me chase my dreams.
Sister! I suggest you that you get married.
You'll get dresses and new jewelry!
Mother!
Yes?
Anum is coming to pick me!
She has invited all friends on a party! Should I go too?
Why?
It's her birthday! That's why!
Please! please!
You should have asked before planning.
Now you should go!
