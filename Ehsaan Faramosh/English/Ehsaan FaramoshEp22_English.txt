The ring is very beautiful. Nawal is very lucky.
Her mother in law is very rich. They have everything.
I got the jewelry made here but the diamond set, I lovingly brought from Canada.
Falak, look at the ring. Isn't it beautiful? I think auntie chose it.
She has a very good taste. She chose all my jewelry.
What are you doing here?
I came to call you for tea.
So you should have knocked before coming? Why did you have to come like thieves?
I didn't knock because the door was open.
Alright. Go. Get lost. I'll come.
Nawal, mom's friends are waiting for you. Please come.
I kept it here.
What happened? What are you looking for?
I cannot find my engagement ring. I kept it here.
What do you mean? It must be here. Check properly.
I kept it here and its not here now.
If you kept it here, it should be here. It won't walk. It doesn't have feet.
You never remember things. Check the drawer.
What is it.. Its my engagement ring.
Oh my god..
Where did you keep the jewelry boxes? Did you keep it in them?
You know how expensive it was? It was diamond.
What difference does it make if its expensive or not? It was special for me. Its my engagement ring.
My friends kept waiting and left and you two are here talking.
What happened?
Nawal's engagement ring is lost?
What do you mean engagement ring is lost?
Mom I kept it there and now its not there.
I told you so many times to take care of things Nawal but you never listen to me.
That's what I'm saying. It wasn't something to be kept anywhere. It was her engagement ring. Its diamond. So expensive.
My head is bursting thinking where it is..
Do you know you kept it there?
I'm certain, I kept it there.
Oh God. My head hurts too. We've looked for it for long enough. You look for it now. I'm going down.
Mom, I hadn't even fulfilled my wishes. I hadn't even looked at it.
Please ask Zakia if she kept it somewhere.
Help me find it please.
My dear we'll find it. Don't worry, we'll find it. I'll ask Zakia right away.
Alright. Stop crying my child. Zakia..
Kabeer?
Yes?
I know you're very upset because of me.
In these past few days, whatever happened, it wasn't feasible at all.
Who was right and who was wrong, I don't want to argue about it. I just want,
remember one thing I'm saying.
I love you like my dear brother.
You're very dear to me like my own brother and I'll never want anything bad for you.
I know this. You don't have to tell me this.
Falak just came to this house.
You know me since long. What do you think?
Will I want anything bad for you or Toqueer?
Or will I do anything to embarrass anybody in this house?
Sister in law, Whatever is happening in the house, is because we have misunderstandings.
Whoever knows you will never doubt your intentions.
I am broken inside. Today, in front of you,
there's not that bold and brave Aaliya, but an Aaliya who is broken. Who has lost.
Sister in law..
Whats wrong with you? What are you saying?
I'm saying the right thing.
Touqueer is very emotional, he won't understand. But you're my brother, you'll understand.
I cannot fight such cheap thoughts and tactics..
Aaliya, where did you go?
I became a little emotional. I'll go listen to Toqueer.
Did you ask Zakia?
I did. She said she didn't come in this room, she doesn't know.
Her tone says she's telling the truth.
Then what happened? Did the earth open up or the sky fall down? When I kept something at a place, how did it go anywhere else?
It is something to worry about.
What happened Nawal?
You have made yourself a mess crying continuously. Can someone tell you got engaged today?
Falak did you take my ring?
What does this mean?
I told you my husband got me so much jewelry. I have everything.
Why would I do such a cheap thing?
No, if you just hid it as a prank, tell me. I'm worried. What will I tell Hamza?
Why do you have to tell him? How would he know?
Don't tell Hamza yet. Give me some time, I'll look in the house. We'll find it if God wills.
She's right. Why do you have to tell him? What will he think?
You didn't care for something he gave you so lovingly. It was diamond.
He might think you don't love him.
You don't have to tell him. Who knows its in the house somewhere. You'll find it. I'm sure.
Don't take stress. Everything will be alright.
Hello?
Where are you Nawal? I've been calling since long. You didn't answer my calls.
Sorry, I was busy.
You were crying? Is everything alright?
No. I just got a little emotional. I was missing dad.
You girls.. You get emotional every time.
Oh wow. We have big people here.
How are you?
I'm fine. How are you? Are you here to meet Nawal?
Yes. Actually I'm here to take Nawal out for lunch.
Alright.
She's here.
How are you dressed up? You should have worn a nice dress. You're going for lunch.
And such light makeup. You're the limit.
I look good.
No. Actually Nawal is very simple. She doesn't know how to get ready. She cannot do anything.
She doesn't know how to get ready. You should have called me. I would have done your makeup.
Come, I'll do it now.
Actually,
I think she's looking beautiful. I love this look of yours.
Where's your engagement ring?
Didn't she tell you? She lost her engagement ring?
She kept it somewhere and forgot. We looked for it but couldn't find it.
Actually, Nawal doesn't know how to take care of precious things. Who does that?
Its the limit.
You lost it?
But where?
I kept it on the table and went to shower. When I came back, it wasn't there. I tried looking for it but..
This is how she is. How leaves such precious things somewhere?
It isn't done. It was her engagement ring.
Had it been some ordinary ring, this would have been justified.
Hamza, I'm so sorry. It was so precious. It was so close to my heart.
I've been so worried and I couldn't sleep all night.
Its alright Nawal.
Relax.
Stop it Nawal. Look at Hamza. He's so worried.
Hamza you must be so angry. It is so.
You know I took off my engagement ring and kept it safe. It was very close to my heart.
I didn't want it to get lost so I kept it safe.
Its okay Nawal. I'll get you another same one. I'll buy it for you.
You must be angry.
I can understand. The first symbol of your love and Nawal lost it. All of us are embarrassed.
See, things aren't important. People are.
Nawal is important for me. And she is with me.
What if she lost the ring? She didn't do it deliberately.
People make mistakes. I could too.
You could make a mistake too.
This doesn't mean we should reprimand someone for the mistake they make.
Come on Nawal. We're getting late.
You're leaving?
I would have left with Kabeer but I stayed because you insisted.
You're happy in your house, it has made me happy. I'm at peace.
I'm not happy mom. I'm just living.
Ignore small things, dear.
As it is, we should ignore such trivial matters. Everything will be alright in a little while.
And love is something that makes a place for itself.
Let it be mom. I don't need such advice. Its my house, I know how to handle it.
Let Nawal come, then leave.
No. She'll be late. They went for lunch. Mom, I shouldn't be saying this but still.
They have been engaged for two days only and you allowed them to go for lunch.
For me and Kabeer you we had to ask a thousand times to meet.
See dear, Hamza requested me himself for lunch
and I didn't have a reason to say no and secondly I myself wanted Nawal to go out with Hamza.
Whatever misunderstandings had been between them should be cleared off
so that they can have a good life once they're married.
If only I had so much independence, I'd be happy in my house.
I would have a good understanding with Kabeer.
What are you saying? I have seen myself. Kabeer is always around you.
He loves you very much. He respects you a lot.
My child, they have given you all the blessings in life.
Don't be ungrateful. Be thankful to God.
Alright, don't lecture me. I'm leaving. Say hello to Nawal once she's back.
Alright.
Bye.
Be happy.
Mam, your tea.
Keep it there.
Alright so you can do this as well.
How was your function? Did everything go fine?
Of course.
I was there, I got everything done myself. How would anything go wrong?
Kabeer told me that Nawal managed everything very well.
By the way, you have this bad habit of claiming things done by others.
You've understood me well.
Yes. I know you well and gradually everyone else will too.
Alright. You believe this?
I'm ready to forget everything you did in the past and move ahead with you. But Falak I want,
you should refrain from your antics. Stop doing things to destroy the peace of our house.
What antics? What are you talking about?
You know very well what I'm talking about.
If I tell your truth to Kabeer, you know what would happen.
Maybe he'll leave you.
Are you scaring me?
I'm not scaring you. I'm trying to make you understand.
I'll not tell anyone, anything.
I will not destroy your house and you'll not destroy the peace of our house.
Alright. I'll do as you say. I'll not destroy the peace of this house but I too have a condition.
What condition?
You'll ask Kabeer to shift into a new house with me.
He will never listen to me but if you say, he'll not put it off. So if you want to maintain peace in the house,
then make Kabeer agree to live separately.
What is your problem here? When you have everything here, what else do you want?
You're my problem.
I don't like you in front of me at all.
So alright then. Ask Kabeer to live separately with me because we cannot live together in this house.
If you want the peace of this house, accept what I'm saying.
Or else you'll see what I can do.
Things aren't important. People are. Nawal is important for me.
What if she lost the ring? she didn't do it deliberately. People make mistakes. You or I could do it.
This doesn't mean we should bad mouth people if they make a mistake.
Kabeer should I ask you something?
Yes?
If I had lost my engagement ring on the next day of the engagement. How would you react?
What sort of a question is this?
Tell me.
What should I tell you? Maybe I would be upset with you. I could have said anything in anger.
Like you should have been careful or how did you lost the ring. Etc.
How many men would be out there who'd tell their fiance to not to worry if they lost their rings and that they'd get them a better one.
Things don't mean more than people.
What is going on in your mind right now? What nonsense are you thinking?
Tell me how many men must be there?
Not one, Falak. See, losing your engagement ring isn't a small thing.
Every men would react. If not today but tomorrow perhaps. He will definitely react.
There are a few. Different.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Nothing Kabeer. Do your work. Use your mobile.
Yes Falak, tell me.
Thank God you answered Nawal. Where were you? Why weren't you answering?
I was getting ready.
For what?
I'm going to meet Sofia aunty. She wanted to introduce me to some guests.
You're the limit. She called you once and you'll go immediately.
You should have shown a bit of attitude and tell her you were busy.
Falak you know I'm not habitual of doing this and neither do I like all this.
You're weird.
I don't understand you. If you give them so much protocol right now, they'll treat you next to dust once you get married.
Do you understand?
Look at Kabeer and his family. What have they done to me?
I gave them a lot of respect and now I'm suffering.
Ask them to accept whatever you want and they'll know its not their way.
It doesn't look good Falak.
Had I said no, it would have been different. Hamza is coming to pick me now.
Its not important that everybody is like your in laws.
There are some people who're good and loving.
Alright don't taunt me. I was just telling you for your own good.
Nasreen.. Nasreen..
Who are you?
My name is Noor.
I've fired Nasreen
You have fired her?
Yes. I hired Noor in her place. Tell her whatever you need done. She'll do it fast.
Who did you ask before firing her?
This is my house. Nasreen changed her loyalty,
I threw her out. Why do I have ask anyone?
You're forgetting that Toqueer gave me the responsibility of the house.
Without my permission, how could you do it?
Toqueer gave you the responsibility of the house but he didn't ask me to get your permission for everything.
I can make my own decisions.
And I will do whatever I can do for the best interest of this house.
And you focus on the rest of your responsibilities. For instance this kitchen.
First of all, decide the menu for today.
Its quite late. The food should be ready by now. And this,
these are a few utility bills, you'll have to stay updated about them.
The salary for the employs and everything.
There are a lot of things. Its a long list. You'll have to do everything in these two days.
Houses don't run itself. You have to burn blood and sweat. Oh well,
I know my responsibilities so I made a list for you.
It'll help you out and I hope everything will be done on time.
I shouldn't be telling this to you again.
Yes. I came to tell you that the garden wasn't cleaned today so get that done as well.
Why are you looking at my face? Do your work.
I threw Nasreen out. She changed her loyalty so I threw her out. Why should I ask someone about it?
Touqeer gave you the responsibility of the house but he didn't bound me to your permission.
I can make my decisions myself.
Its a long list and you'll have to do everything in these two days.
And yes, I came to tell you that the garden isn't cleaned either. Get it done.
What does she think that I'm her servant that I'll do everything?
I shouldn't have taken the responsibility of the house.
Whatever it is, I need to live separately with Kabeer but whatever it takes,
I'll not let Aaliya live peacefully. I'll destroy her.
So dinner is ready. It smells delicious.
Aaliya didn't come?
She isn't feeling well so she is in her room.
What happened to her? Nobody told me.
I think I'll take her food to her room.
Yes, this would be fine.
No. Let it be. Tell the maid, why do you have to?
I didn't know she was sick. Had I known I'd have cooked something else for her.
But I'll go and give this to her now. You should start.
Why do you have to?
Its alright. She'll serve. Please start.
Aaliya, how are you now?
Why did you bring food for me here?
I needed a chance to take revenge for my insult.
What do you mean? What chance? What insult?
You're very simple. You didn't understand me yet. You wanted to show me down.
I mixed poison in this food and once you die after eating this, I'll be the queen of the house.
What are you trying to say?
Oh. You know now. You'll not eat this food now.
What are you doing now?
Have you lost your mind? What are you doing now?
What did you do? I brought you food. If you didn't want to eat, you should have told me.
Aaliya, what is this?
I didn't do this. She threw it herself. She's lying.
Have some fear of God. Why are you saying this? 
Kabeer I've never seen someone disrespect food so much. Kabeer she pushed me and threw this food.
Falak, relax. We'll have this cleaned.
Kabeer she threw soup on my foot. Its burning.
You come with me. We'll put some ointment on it.
Touqeer listen to me.
What is this? You're an educated woman and I didn't expect this from you.
She brought you food so lovingly. What is the fault of that poor girl?
She isn't a poor girl Touqeer. She isn't.
She isn't as innocent as she looks.
Enough.
Noor.
Why did Aaliya do this to me? Why does she hate me so much?
Is it hurting you? Should I take you to the doctor?
Its alright but its burning a lot.
I've put cream on it, it'll get better in a while.
Kabeer, I'm scared now. I cannot live here anymore.
She threw hot soup on me. She might kill me tomorrow, what do we expect from her?
I cannot live here anymore. Go somewhere from here.
I'll talk to Toqueer.
They have been trying to make her understand but has it made a difference.
 It didn't make a difference yesterday, it won't make a difference now.
You don't care about me Kabeer.
Why don't I care for you Kabeer? You're a part of my life.
Your pain is my pain.
Then why don't you care about my pain? Why don't you understand?
The hatred I saw in her eyes, I was scared. Talk to Aaliya yourself. What does she want?
Falak, I apologize for what Aaliya did.
Why are you apologizing? She should be the one apologizing.
Tell him now. What nonsense were you saying?
For God's sake be quiet.
I am not lying. She is the one who threw the tray.
 She said she has poisoned my food and she wants to kill me.
What?
Kabeer she how she's lying. Why would I do that? Why would I poison her food?
She is accusing me again. What benefit will I get killing you?
Because you want to own the house.
You want to live separately with Kabeer. Isn't this your plan?
Oh God..
I don't believe this is how you return my love.
 I took you as my elder sister, did so good to you and this is how you return it.
Kabeer why would I do this? Tell her. Why didn't I die before all this?
Aaliya come along.
I'm not wrong. Trust me. I'm not lying.
Time will tell I was right, if God wills.
This girl is the termite that's eating the roots of this house from the foundations. 
You'll only understand when everything shatters.
Aaliya..
I don't want to live here. I cannot live here. I'll turn mad.
Falak get a grip on yourself.
My head is hurting Kabeer. I cannot breathe.
I'll get water.. Oh..
Brother.. Falak..
Kabeer..
Falak are you alright?
Yes what happened to me?
Relax you're alright.
Kabeer I had a bad dream. I saw you were leaving me.
Falak what are you saying?
I will not leave you. I'll always be with you.
Thank God you're awake Falak. The doctor is here as well.
I'm fine. Nothing is wrong with me.
Falak, worry about yourself as well. The doctor is here. Get yourself checked, we'll be satisfied.
No Kabeer. Go and check on Aaliya. She isn't well. She was stressed.
Aaliya is alright.
Doctor, please check. Please
Tell Kabeer to get me a new house because we cannot live together.
 If you want peace in the house, listen to me.
Otherwise you'll see what I can do.
You're very simple. You haven't understood me yet.
 You wanted to show me down. I poisoned your food.
You'll die after eating this so I'll rule the house peacefully.
Oh, now you know and you won't eat it.
