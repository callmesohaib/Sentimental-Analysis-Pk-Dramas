I couldn't see their face or the number plate.
I came from shopping and I was keeping my bags in the car. Suddenly a bike stopped by,
They took Ilham and went away. I couldn't stop them.
Such kidnappings are often done for ransom.
Do you have doubts about anyone. Can anyone do it?
I am not doubting anyone and no such enemies..
Yes. Hamza. I believe is Hamza's doing.
Who is Hamza?
Hamza Hashim.
He is the CEO of Hashim and Co.
He's our business competitor and my ex-wife's husband.
We have a custody case with my ex-wife and Hamza is supporting her.
He threatened us that he'd bother us and not let us live peacefully.
I believe if you ask him, he'll tell you where Ilham is.
Inspector, do whatever investigation you want to do but please get my daughter.
I want my daughter back.
See, we'll try our best. I'll inform you as soon as we get an update. Please stay calm.
Kabir, I'll call the IG, he's my father's friend.
Don't worry, nothing will happen to Nawal. She'll be back soon.
Sir, the SHO is here to meet you.
SHO?
Alright, make him sit, I'll come.
Okay sir.
I'll just come.
Yes sir, tell me how can I help you?
You must know Mr. Kabeer.
His daughter was kidnapped in the morning.
What?!
What?
Are you talking about Ilham?
Yes. Mr. Kabeer has only one daughter. Her name is Ilham.
Hamza, my daughter..
I knew Kabeer wouldn't be able to take care of her thats why I wanted her here with me.
Mr. Kabeer and his wife have expressed their suspicions about you.
They say that its you behind everything.
What?!
That's why I need your cooperation. I want to investigate from you.
Yes sure but is he mad? Why is he doubting me?
I think his daughter's kidnapping has affected his brain. He has lost his mind. Why would we do this?
You have a case with him for the custody of the child. Is it so?
Yes of course but how does it prove that we have kidnapped the child.
We want to bring her to this house, to us.
This is our duty. Its the question of an innocent life.
See, rather than wasting your time here, you should try and find her.
We filed the case against them and that's why they're blaming us.
Maybe they have arranged the kidnapping themselves to trap us.
You're not understanding their game.
Don't waste time here. We're worried as well. Go and get the child as soon as possible.
Don't investigate from us but them.
Alright. Thank you.
My child..
Relax, nothing will happen. He said they're looking for her.
Why is the police here? Why are you crying? What happened?
Someone kidnapped Ilham.
What? Why? When?
In the afternoon today. The SHO was here for that.
This is nobody but Kabeer's doing. Its his game.
He got Ilham kidnapped deliberately.
So they can put pressure on us and pressurize us.
But we'll not come under pressure.
Hamza what are you saying, Kabeer is her father. How will her father kidnap her?
Mom, Kabeer and Nawal accused us of kidnapping..
The child I want to bring in this house as my daughter, would I kidnap her?
Falak, we'll go to them right now. Lets go.
What happened? Why are you so wired up?
I'm not wired up. Are you mad?
Who is this child?
This is my friend's daughter. His wife has died and he lives alone.
He's out of town for a few days. He's asking to take care of her until he comes.
Which friend? You've never mentioned such a friend ever.
Sher Khan, tell me the truth. Who is this child and where did you bring her from?
You are the limit. I didn't bring her from anywhere. She's my friend's daughter.
He'll come in a few days and take her back. Why are you worried?
Take care of her. I'll get milk for her.
Did you find out anything about my daughter?
Do whatever it takes but bring my daughter back.
What did they say? Did they find anything?
They're trying.
Kabeer I told you something bad would happen..
I told you we should have left from here. You didn't listen to me. Had you listened, our daughter would be here.
What did I know that this would happen and such a big incident would happen..
Hamza threatened me in the court. He said he would make me suffer.
I know he's behind all this.
Listen to me. I want to hold his collar and ask him why he's doing this..
I'll hold you people accountable.
Tell me where is my daughter.
That's why I wanted to take her with me.
I knew you'd not get time from pampering one another. You'd never take care of my daughter.
These things don't sound good from your mouth.
If you had taken care of her, she wouldn't have been lost.
Your husband is responsible for this. Hold him accountable!
I know he has hidden Ilham somewhere.. Ask him. Nobody else can do this.
What nonsense is this? What are you saying?
You had enmity with us. Why did you bring our daughter in between?
She's innocent. Why are you punishing her for this?!
Move back!
If I want I can file a case against you for kidnapping Ilham.
If something happens to my daughter. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you both!
I left a piece of my heart with you guys.
I should have taken her along. I left her here, trusting you. Where is my daughter!
You hid your daughter and are now creating a facade for kidnapping.
Do you think both of us our fools?
Falak, both of them are creating a drama.
You'll see what I do with the two of you.
I will raise this point in the court that you're an irresponsible father who cannot take care of his daughter.
I'll see then how the court gives you the custody for Ilham.
Lets go Falak..
What does he mean?
Kabeer I'm asking you what did Hamza say? What will happen?
This means he'll tell the judge that we cannot take care of our daughter.
We're irresponsible and we cannot take care of our daughter.
What will happen then?
The judge will give the custody to Falak.
Eat something. You haven't eaten anything since morning. You'll get sick.
How can I eat? I cannot swallow a bite.
I don't know whether my daughter had milk or not.
How would she be?
She doesn't even take milk from just anyone.
Did you talk to the SHO?
I did. He's reassuring me. But..
But these reassurances don't reassure my heart.
Nothing will happen to Ilham.
She'll be fine and be back to us, by the Grace of God.
If God wills.
Make her quiet, why is she crying?
I'm trying to give her milk. She isn't taking it.
She has been crying ever since she came.
Sher Khan you did wrong bringing her here.
Listen to me. Call your friend and ask him to take his daughter back.
If she stays here, she'll be sick.
He is out of town. He'll come tomorrow.
Tell him then. Tell him she'll be sick.
If something happens to her, we'll have to suffer. Listen to me.
I'll call him.
Yes, Sher Khan, tell me.
Sir, the child is not in a good shape.
She isn't eating or drinking milk. She's been crying ever since she came.
She's a child. Handle her with care, she'll be fine.
And listen don't call me again.
Sir,
her condition isn't good. God forbid, if something happens to her, then..
Nothing will happen. Do as I say. Its not the time yet.
When I tell you, send her back..
But sir..
Didn't you hear?
Until I say, keep her with you. She won't die.
Didn't I say, I'll bother you very much. I'll make you two cry.
Were you standing here and listening to me?
What are you saying? I thought there must be some information about Ilham or you must be talking to the police so I came here.
It was his call. He said don't worry, she'll be found soon.
God please, keep my daughter safe. Keep her life safe.
Please bless her and bring her out of this trouble. Please bring her to us.
You're All Merciful. Please listen to my prayers God. Please.
Kabeer, Toqueer is calling.
Hello brother..
Kabeer so much happened and you didn't tell me.
I would have talked to someone. I would have done something.
I don't understand what to do.
Everything happened so suddenly.
We are not in our senses. Its been all day we have been looking for her.
I'm sorry.
I know. I have an idea how painful it is for you and Nawal. How testing this is? I'm really sorry.
Tell me did you complain to the police. What are they saying? Did they tell anything?
Yes I did complain.
They're saying that they will find the culprits soon.
Don't worry. The DSP is my friend. I'll talk to him myself. Everything will be okay if God wills.
Don't lose hope. Alright.
Alright.
Aaliya and I are coming. I've asked for the tickets. I'll let you know.
Aaliya wants to talk to Nawal. Make her talk. Bye.
Aaliya wants to talk..
Hello, Nawal..
If I knew this would happen, I would have never let you go.
You gave me Ilham's responsibility and I couldn't take care of her.
Nothing will happen, if God wills, you'll find her soon. You'll see.
Aaliya please pray that I find my daughter safely. I'll die, I cannot live without her.
Nawal.. Nawal you..
My dear, you're so strong. Take care of yourself. Be strong.
I know you're all alone in this test but right now you don't have to compose yourself but Kabeer as well.
If he sees you crying like this, he'll be broken as well. Do you understand?
Stay strong please. Take care. Take care of Kabeer as well. We're praying constantly here. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
God knows what has happened..
Remember when Hafsa.. It was such a difficult time.
Its very difficult.
Exactly. Ilham is our daughter as well.
Give me the phone, I'll call the DSP.
Here..
I'm going to the police station.
Right now? You just came. Get some rest.
No Nawal.
How can I rest? Our daughter isn't with us.
Let me go, I'll be back in a while. Don't worry.
Okay, be careful.
Hamza.. Did you find anything about Ilham? Where is she?
Don't worry. Your daughter will be found.
Its been so long. I don't know whether the police is working or not.
If you also sit idle how will I find out about my daughter..
I have no hopes from Kabeer and Nawal. They'll be at peace like she isn't their daughter.
Please do something. Lets go to the police station. Pressurize them to find my daughter from anywhere.
See I'm not free. I have a lot to do.
You don't have to go anywhere. Go sit in your room. I'll go when I get time.
Khan? Sher Khan, wake up..
Tell me what is it? Why are you bothering me?
I think the child has fever. Her body is burning up. Come and look at her.
So what should I do? Am I a doctor, why are you bothering me?
Give her medicine for fever, she'll be fine. Don't bother me.
Don't bother you?
Sher Khan, take the girl to the hospital. Get a doctor.
If something happens to her, what will we do?
Come and look at her.
I told you don't bother me. Let me sleep.
You will talk on this point on the next hearing that Kabeer is an irresponsible man
who couldn't take care of his daughter.
Let the girl be found first, then we'll see.
We'll get the girl.
I mean, the police is doing its work. The child will be found.
Alright. Just prepare.
The case should not proceed to another hearing.
You'll get your payment.
Alright.. Thank you.
Yes tell me.. When is the meeting? Alright I'm coming. Okay.
Faheem?
Yes sir..
Ask the driver to get my car..
Falak mam took your car.
Why? Where is her car?
Her car is at the workshop.
Alright. Go.
I'm Hamza Hashim, I want to track my car's location.
Okay.
Sir your car is outside city police station.
What have you people done uptil now? Why haven't you found my daughter yet?
Why are the culprits not caught?
See we're trying our best. I've invested my entire team for this.
Had you been trying, my daughter would have been with me.
Do you know how a mother feels?
My daughter is away from my sight since so many days. Why don't you find her?
If God wills, we'll find her and we'll catch the culprits soon as well.
Arrest them. They're the real culprits. They have kidnapped my daughter.
Its their doing so that my daughter doesn't come to me.
Put them in jail and they'll tell you the truth.
Are you in your senses?
What are you saying?
Had we kidnapped her, why would we be searching for her everywhere?
This is just a drama to show the world.
You can fool the world, the police but not me.
Tell me where my daughter is. Where is she?
Do you think we're so cheap? We're not like you Falak.
Nawal.. Let it be. Its no use arguing with her.
Remember this, if I don't find my daughter, I'll not forgive you two.
I want my daughter back. God knows what they're taking a revenge for. I made a big mistake.
I left my daughter with you.
God knows how she must be..
Mrs. Hamza control yourself.
As soon as we get an update. We'll inform you.
Please go home right now.
Where did you go?
Police station
When I told you not to go to the police station without asking me.
Why did you go?
Don't you understand what I say or don't you value what I say?
You just go wherever you want.
I was worried.
I told you to come with me but you said no.
My daughter is kidnapped. I don't know where she is. How can I be at peace?
And you're taunting me as if I committed a sin.
Alright. You're missing your daughter a lot.
You've never missed her before today.
Hamza what are you saying?
This is the same daughter,
that you left for money. While she was crying. You left her with your ex-husband.
And you never asked about her.
What are you saying? I told you Kabeer forced me to sign.
What do you think? If I don't say anything, I don't know anything?
Falak..
You're not so simple that someone could force you to sign documents.
Its different if you signed them yourself.
I can't believe you're saying all this.
I believe that aunty must have fed you behind me.
Don't involve my mother.
This is what you sow that you're reaping.
I don't believe it you heard aunty..
Shut up. Just shut up..
Why are you angry? What did I do?
Falak, after today, you'll not go anywhere without asking me.
Alright. I'll not go anywhere. 
But why do you forget, I'm a mother.
My daughter is a part of me. How can I forget? How can I be at peace?
I don't believe you're treating me this way. Do I deserve this?
 Let me be. You said you wanted to bring her here. She'd live with me.
Yes I did. Because you forced me.
I have no attachment with the child. She's not my daughter but Kabeer's. 
And let me clear this to you..
After today, if you go somewhere without asking me, I'll not tolerate it.
Falak I have a reputation in the society and its your duty to respect that.
And if you will not stop with your stupid antics.
 I'll change my decision and take the case back.
You cannot do this Hamza.
Falak, I can do this.
Hamza.. Hamza.. you cannot do this.
