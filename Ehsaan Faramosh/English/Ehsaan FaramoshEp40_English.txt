You will not stay out so late again.
What's with you, Kabir? Why are you putting restrictions on me like this?
Falak if you don't take care of yourself, then I'll be forced to be strict.
Right now Falak needs your love and attention.
Ups and downs occur in business, but this should not affect your home.
I have a relationship with sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir and it will always remain.
I can never end that relationship.
I don't need your permission to go there. I can come and go as I please.
You know how hard Kabir has worked for this company. He works day and night for this company.
He's very worried... will you talk to Hamza?
Hamza, you withdrew your shares from Kabir foods?
Yes.
You didn't even tell me about it.
It wasn't important enough for me to tell you.
You shouldn't have done this, they have lost millions because of you.
I've lost millions as well, but I didn't blame them.
You don't understand, their company is in crisis.
I just learned that Sherazi has withdrawn his shares as well.
Why are you so worried about them?
What are acting like a child?
He's Falak's husband, she's worried because of him. She's my sister and I'm worried for her.
Look, this is business, it would be better if you don't involve yourself in this.
Kabir is your friend as well, why are you ruining your friendship with him?
We are relatives as well.
Invest in their company again... they need you.
Niwal... I have no intention of investing.
Please don't force me.
I can't see Falak worried.
Think that I'm asking you to do this. Will you not listen to me?
Niwal, I don't have time for small businesses. I don't want to invest in Pakistan.
I've decided that I'm moving my entire business to Canada.
There are a lot of opportunities to move forward.
What do you mean?
What are you saying? Will you not come back?
I will come back... but I will not wind up the business. My offices will stay here.
Niwal I've decided that we'll shift here after the wedding.
What? So that's why you don't want to invest here.
Yes... that's why I don't want to invest in a new business in Pakistan.
Hamza, you know that I don't want to go there.
If I wanted to settle abroad with you, couldn't I have done that before?
Niwal, my entire family is here, I can't leave them here.
I'm forced to stay here.
You had no intention of staying there before.
Now you want to stay there.
Try to understand Niwal.
My sister is here... Naveen's schooling is here.
Brother Raheel's business is here and I have to look after everything.
Who will take care of them if not me?
Please Niwal, you'll have to support me.
My family is important to me like your family is important to you.
Mother will be here alone without me. Who does she have apart from me?
I cannot leave her alone here.
Niwal...
Hamza, there is no point in arguing! You'll have to come back!
Alright fine, we'll talk about this when I come back to Pakistan.
Take good care of yourself... you don't need to think much about Kabir...
Kabir and sister Aliyah are very talented, I'm sure they'll find an investor somewhere.
Okay? Bye.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
If we get a major loan from somewhere, then all of our crises will end.
That's true, there's no doubt about that.
The problem is that we won't be able to find a big investor right now.
We're going into a loss...
Everyone can see that. No one will take the risk.
The best option is to take out a loan.
Alright... do what you think is right.
I'll have the documents prepared, we'll apply at a few places.
Let's see where we get it from.
All we can do is hope for the best. I'll have coffee made.
Hello Hamza, how are you?
I'm fine, but I think that you're not fine.
What do you mean?
I keep business and family separate, and I expect you to do the same.
If you wanted to talk, you could have talked to me. Why did you involve Niwal in this?
I didn't involve her, who told you that?
Niwal called me, who can tell her other than you?
Hamza, we're friends and you know me. I didn't tell Niwal... Falak did.
Why would I tell her?
I removed the shares because of you and sister Aliyah.
You shook hands with my enemy, hence I removed my shares.
But that doesn't mean that you should involve our families.
I asked Falak not to tell Niwal, but she didn't listen.
I'm sorry if you took offense to that.
Remember when I told you and sister Aliyah and Sherazi can't be trusted?
But you guys didn't listen to me.
Now regret the decision you took.
People make mistakes.
Do you see what happens when you don't listen to me?
Do you remember...
when you needed me I stood by you. Everyone asked me not to.
But still, I helped you...
Don't make me remember your favors.
I've already paid you back for those favors by investing millions.
Which you withdrew.
Hamza everyone thinks that you endured a loss, but you benefited from it.
You sold the shares when the price was up, we're the ones who endured the loss.
I think Sherazi is just an excuse, you had already decided to leave.
I'm right, aren't I?
I heard chameleons change colors, but for the first time, I'm seeing a human do it.
Is money worth so much to you that you've forgotten about your relationships?
Anyways... I've taken too much of your time, I'm sorry.
From now on you won't be getting any calls from me.
What happened? Why are you in a bad mood?
Falak, I had forbidden you to discuss this with Nawal. Still you didn't listen to me.
So what... sister Niwal is my sister.
If I do not discuss my worries with her, then who will I discuss it with?
What did we gain?
You had no idea how embarrassed I was in front of Hamza because of what you did.
I feel so small.
Did Hamza say something to you?
Hamza thinks that I'm using Niwal for my gain.
Hello...
Why weren't you picking up? I've been calling you for ages.
I was busy..
Were you busy, or were you ignoring me?
If you can be busy, then why can't I be busy?
I just wanted to talk to you...
I was missing you. I feel seeing your face.
I'll video call you.
I'm at a friend's house and I can't video call.
Alright.
Message me when you reach home, I'll call you.
Bye.
Many congratulations, God has blessed you with a daughter.
Many many congratulations to you all!
Congratulations son!
Thank you, doctor.
How's Falak?
The mother and the child are in a good state. You guys can meet her shortly.
Thank you, doctor...
Congratulations...
You too brother Tawqir...
You're an aunt now
Congratulations Kabir.
Thanks.
Many congratulations.
Many congratulations to you as well. After so many years...
we've had a child born in our home.
Many congratulations to you as well sister...
Many congratulations to you as well... get something sweet for us!
I'm sorry... I'll be right back.
Falak... after all the worries that we've faced in the last few months...
this is a major happiness.
She is beautiful.
Why are you crying?
Greetings.
Greetings to you too...
Look she's trying to speak.
Falak... many congratulations
Many congratulations!
Mother, she has a Falak's face.
She looks a bit like me as well.
May God give her health.
Sister...
She's beautiful. May God protect her.
May God give her success.
Amen.
Hafsa was begging for us to bring her here.
You should have brought her, she had been waiting.
No way, she would have bothered everyone.
She'll meet her once Falak returns home.
What are you saying? Why would she return to her home...
who will take care of her? She'll come with us. We'll take care of her.
Kabir... I'll take Falak.
It's a tradition of ours... after the delivery, the girl returns to her mother's home.
Auntie... you'll be worried for no reason. Sister Aliyah is right, we'll take Falak home.
I'll go home with my mother. I get stressed at sister Aliyah's home.
Kabir, don't worry.
Falak is my daughter and this is her right.
It's alright... it's all the same. She just needs someone to care for her.
It doesn't matter where Falak goes, we all are family.
It's time to feed the baby.
Sister Aliyah... give her the ghutti (first tonic given to infants after birth),
I want my daughter to have some of your qualities.
Thank you Kabir, but why me? Let Auntie give it to her.
Or Falak should give it to her. A mother has the first right.
Aliyah is right. Auntie, you should give it to her...
besides elders have more blessings in their hands.
Forget it, at least we tried...
Mother.... father!
How are you, my dear?
I'm fine... mother, how was uncle's baby?
She's fine... she's very cute.
Why didn't you bring her here?
She's small, so the doctor asked us not to bring her here.
Then take me to her...
Okay, we'll take you in a few days.
Okay...
Come on now.
Did you miss us?
Hamza...
Yes?
My dear, what are you thinking about? Is everything alright?
It's nothing.
Alright. Did you congratulate Niwal?
No, about what?
Falak just gave birth to a girl. Did Niwal not tell you?
No.
Aren't you talking?
Yeah, it's been a few days... I was bust and she was upset with me
I called her a few times, but she didn't pick up.
Why is she upset?
It's about us settling here.
She's weird and I can't understand her.
Girls dream of getting settled in such countries after getting married,
but she doesn't want to leave Pakistan. I don't know what she wants.
I told you that before you take a decision, discuss it with her.
Mother... business is good here... there are more opportunities to move forward.
My dear... every person has the right to make their decision.
She has told you her decision and you have to accept it.
What about you all? How can I leave you and your sister?
I don't mind going to Pakistan.
I don't want there to be a wedge between these two because of me.
I already hold myself responsible.
What about the business here?
Should I leave it? People will think that I'm crazy.
People will say that I'm leaving a gold mine for a coal mine.
What are you saying?
You have a successful business there as well,
why don't you take care of them both? You can come and go, no one's stopping you.
Mother's right...
Not at all... I'll keep this business.
That one will be part-time... I'll go there when I need to.
If Niwal is adamant about her decision, then I am as well.
This is not how it is Kabir.
Miss Aliyah gave me half the payment two months ago.
After that, I heard nothing,
even though she promised me that she would provide me with the money in the coming week.
Please try to understand.
I told you that we're going through a crisis.
Trust me... you'll get your money soon. Give us more time.
Look, I need to pay my salary. Where will I give it from?
Try and understand my compulsion as well.
By the way, almost a hundred of my men work in your restaurant.
If they don't come, then how will your restaurant function?
It would be better if you release me their salary,
and so that things start moving forward for your business as well.
You have until tomorrow.
After that, I won't return.
Get me the manager.
Let me talk to my lawyer... Falak bring my phone, I'll call the lawyer.
We'll get you anyone you want.
Take him in!
Don't worry Kabir. When a door closes, another opens.
It seems to me that all doors have closed.
Don't say that. Don't be upset.
Falak, things might not be the same for us financially.
Our life won't stay the same as well.
I'm disappointed to think that I won't be able to give my daughter the life I imagined for her.
What do you mean? What are you trying to say?
We'll have to forego a lot of luxuries.
My account is empty and all the payments are at a halt.
I've applied for a loan from the bank, but if we don't get one, we'll be in default.
What are you saying? Talk to sister Aliyah.
I'm sure she has money... talk to brother Tawqir, and ask him to help us.
Whatever sister Aliyah had, she had already invested.
And brother Tawqir... we've taken his entire savings as well.
Kabir, what will we do now? We have to figure out something, how can we spend life this way?
The loss that we've endured... I don't see any way out of it, no matter how hard I try.
Will we be poor now? Everything will be taken from us.
Just think what the people would say...
My friends are asking me to throw a baby shower... and I haven't done that as well.
I've been stalling them for so long. What will I say to the people?
Kabir...
Do something... how will I spend my life without all these things?
Yes sir?
Mr. Kabir, we have your arrest warrant.
You'll have to come to the station with us.
What is the arrest warranty for? What have I done?
You'll know that when you come to the station. Come with us.
Take him in!
Wait a minute... you are being unjust.
Are we being unjust? You've taken people's money and haven't returned them for three months...
Is that not unjust... take him in!
Let me talk to my lawyer... Falak get my phone... I'll call my lawyer
We'll get you anyone you want.
Take him in!
Where are you taking my husband?
Tell sister Aliyah about this.
Take him in!
We have a major news for you...
the owner of the biggest food chain in the country has been arrested today...
Falak... has the police arrested Kabir?
No... Kabir went himself... he wanted to discuss his case.
I heard something else on the TV.
It's nonsense, you know how the media exaggerates things.
What will we do now? What must my friends be thinking?
We won't be able to show our faces to anyone after this.
Don't worry... just pray...
that the police don't do anything to Kabir.
You can't harass my client. Arresting him in front of his family...
is embarrassing for him.
We got the orders from above and we have a lot of pressure.
Tell me, what should we have done?
I have some brotherly advice for you... a formal complaint has been filed...
You can either talk to him... or you can the bail order and I'll release Mr. Kabir.
Sister, get me out of here.
Don't worry, the lawyer is talking to them
What happened? Did you talk to him?
They are not willing to leave Kabir like this...
The SHO said that...
there is pressure on him. But don't worry.
Mr. Wahab has filed the complaint... we have to either talk to him... or...
bring court orders.
The time is over now... we'll have to wait till tomorrow.
But try... the magistrate must still be there.
Talk to Mr. Wahab...
if he takes his complaint back, then something might happen. I'll be able to get Kabir out.
As far as the paperwork is concerned I'll have it taken care of tomorrow morning.
Mr. Wahab's number is off. I talked to his manager, he said that he's out of the city.
Kabir, don't worry... it's only for one night. We'll get you out of here tomorrow.
We'll have you bailed out tomorrow. Don't worry, we're here.
Be strong...
We'll take care of everything.
If God is willing.
What happened? Did you bail Kabir out? Where is he?
Falak, we weren't able to bail him out today.
Why not? Will Kabir spend the night in jail?
Falak relax.
It's only one night. He'll be bailed out tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning... he's your brother and he loves you.
You couldn't get him out... how can you leave him there?
Control yourself Falak.
All of this happened because of him... ever since I moved here, they've wanted something bad to happen to me.
If you own half the business, then why should Kabir be the only one who is defamed...
She should go to jail as well... have her arrested as well...
Falak...
Tawqir...
Falak, what are you saying?
Aliyah, don't listen to what she's saying...
She's angry, that's why she's saying this.
Enough my dear.
Auntie, please make her understand.
We know what we're going through seeing Kabir in jail.
You had Kabir jailed so that I may be humiliated in my circle.
Half the city knows that my husband is in jail. 
I can't show my face to anyone... that's what you wanted, right?
Aliyah let's go home... because there's no point in staying here.
Kabir will be bailed out tomorrow morning.
What kind of careless people are they?
They ruined our honor!
Falak enough... come sit here.
We shouldn't have gone there. She has no respect.
What's with you? She was angry. 
Don't make an issue out of that.
Are you kidding me?
Didn't you see her behavior? She misbehaved with us.
Tawqir, what we're doing is for Kabir. Forget about Falak.
I'm serving dinner... go and change.
Falak... you shouldn't have been rude to sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir.
I wasn't rude... it's a fact. Kabir is in lock up because of them.
I don't know if that's true or not. What I do know is that no matter what happens...
one shouldn't let go of respect.
Did you see how hurt brother Tawqir and sister Aliyah were?
No matter how hurt they were, I don't care.
Besides... only I know what I'm going through.
Falak... my dear sister...
Listen to me... call them and apologize. 
What if brother Tawqir and sister Aliyah tell Kabir what happened when he gets out tomorrow?
How hurt Kabir would be?
I don't care about that, why would I call them?
This is a mess they created.
They should call me and apologize.
Her husband is home... resting with a full stomach.
We're the ones in pain. My husband is in lock up. I wonder how he must be.
Alright, don't worry... Kabir will be back tomorrow.
Go home... freshen up and rest. We'll come by in the evening.
Won't you guys come inside?
No Kabir... I need to attend a few meetings at work.
Tawqir is right... you should rest.
And don't worry. God willing everything will be alright.
Brother... sister...
Thank you so much...
What's with you? Why are you acting like a stranger?
Go on now... take care.
Farewell.
Aliyah, sit in the front seat.
Take care... don't worry.
We'll meet in the evening.
Farewell*
Kabir, you're back. Are you alright? Did they say something to you?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Did sister Aliyah and brother Tawqir not come in with you?
No... they dropped me off and left.
Sister Aliyah had to go to the office and brother Tawqir was in a rush as well.
Was he in a rush, or he didn't want to face me?
What's with you? What are you talking about?
Do you have any idea how hard last night was for me?
I was alone here and there were all sorts of things going on in the news.
My friends kept asking me all night about what was going on. 
We can't show our faces anywhere.
Do you see my state? I'm so worried and you're worried about the people
Somewhere... what Falak said seems right to me.
It was my idea to invest with Hamza... and partnering up with Sherazi...
Kabir never said that I was wrong.
Now it feels...
that I shoved him off a cliff.
I want time...
to go back so that I may take both of my decisions back.
Remember one thing... a word said... an arrow released and a decision made in business...
can never be taken back.
So be careful in the future.
 We can't change what happened.
I don't want to see Kabir in any problem.
That's all.
Kabir...
There is a bad news.
I've gotten used to listening to bad news.
Anyways... what did you come here to say?
The bank called... our loan request has been rejected.
What?
Sister... you said that the manager was hopeful that we would get the approval.
Yes, but we didn't get the approval.
We had one last hope and that's gone as well.
We'll figure something out.
What will happen and how?
It's been three months since we paid the workers. 
The investors are threatening us with a case.
What will we do now? I don't understand anything that's going on!
Are you insane? How can this be?
Why not? Try and understand... we need it!
If you guys can't handle the business, wind it up!
Free yourself and Kabir.
Please... try and understand!
Aliyah... you're acting like a child. We have invested everything that we had, apart from this home.
And you want to offer this to the bank. This cannot happen.
It's our family home, we were raised here and we have a lot of memories here.
Tawqir...
we need to do something to get out of this crisis.
Trust me... it's just for a little while.
As soon as things get better... we'll buy back the house.
It's not that easy.
I know... the decision is hard.
But we don't have any other way. We applied for the loan... that was rejected...
There are no new investors...
To rebuild this business...
Kabir has worked very hard.
