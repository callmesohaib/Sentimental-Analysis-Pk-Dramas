What happened Hamza?
Who shouldn't be caught by the police? Who were you talking to?
Nothing. There was an issue in the office. I was discussing that.
Alright. Tell me. I've never seen you so angry ever before.
What useless things are you asking? I'm telling you its an issue in the office.
Even if I tell you, what difference would it make?
You know very well, I'm already stressed.
By the way, where did you go?
Do you know what happened with me? I went to meet Ilham.
Kabeer and Nawal treated me so badly. They didn't let me meet my daughter.
And Kabeer dared throw me out of the house and told me never to come back.
They've snatched my daughter from me and now he threatened me
that the court will rule in his favor. This cannot be.
I will not let this happen Hamza. Call the lawyer right now and ask him to get a date for next week.
I want to win this case anyhow. I need my daughter back.
After the incident their case is week. The court will not decide in their favor.
Once I have my daughter back, I'll never let these two see her face for the rest of my life.
Hamza.. I'm saying something to you. Are you listening?
No Falak. I'm not listening. I told you I'm already worried. Don't bother me anymore.
Hamza, whats wrong with you? Why are you talking to me in this tone? What did I do?
How else should I talk to you? You don't understand what I'm saying.
You're only worried about your daughter, Ilham.. all the time.
Your daughter has become a punishment for me.
Everything around me is crumbling because of your daughter.
If you take her name in front of me after today, it won't be good.
You wanted to bring her to me. You wanted her to stay with me.
No I don't want it. Why would I?
She isn't my daughter. She's your daughter. What relationship do I have with her?
But I'm your wife.
Do you even realize how much pain I'm in?
My daughter is away from me. I'm in so much pain.
How can you say all this?
I know everything. I certainly know how much you love your daughter and how much you care for her?!
Listen, don't put up this charade in front of me. Understood?
Do you want your daughter to come to you?
The documents that Kabeer have, clearly state that I've denounced Ilham's custody and I cannot claim again.
Leave that to me. I'll go to the lawyer. I'll bring Ilham to you.
Neither Kabeer nor anybody else can take your daughter away from you.
Sir why don't you understand,
the people who kidnapped my daughter are roaming about on the streets and you don't want me to worry?
If that woman is caught who kidnapped my daughter, then go and arrest her husband.
Investigate from him. He'll tell you everything.
See sir, please catch him anyhow. I'll not be at peace until he's arrested.
Today it was my daughter, tomorrow he can just kidnap anybody else's daughter.
I want that man behind bars at all costs.
Please do something about it. Thank you.
They take everything easily.
Nawal, why are you so worried?
Shouldn't I be worried?
Did you hear Falak, how she threatened us? She can do anything. I'm afraid.
Kabeer if the court really gives her Ilham's custody, what will we do?
Please compose yourself. Relax.
You don't have to worry. I'm with you.
Don't worry because I'm with you.
You talked to the DSP. Tell me what is he saying?
He said they'll catch him very soon. They're close to him
Kabeer we don't know how many people are involved in this? Who are they and what can they do?
We should be thankful that we have our daughter back.
Lets leave everything on God now. The police would know best. Please don't get involved in it.
Nawal what are you saying?
So what else can I say? We're being tested one after another.
God forbid if something happens to you, what will we do?
Nothing will happen to me.
Nawal until the people, who harmed my daughter, aren't caught, I'll not be at peace.
I will take them to their consequences.
Nawal, our daughter's life was being gambled upon
and now I'll not let anybody else's daughter suffer.
What right are you talking about Falak?
You let go off all your rights yourself. Nobody forced you.
Have you forgotten everything?
You cannot take her along until the court decides.
Do whatever you want to do in the court.
You're only worried about your daughter. All the time, you chant, Ilham.
Everything of mine is being destroyed because of your daughter.
If you take her name again, it won't be good.
You wanted to bring her to me yourself. You wanted her to stay with me.
I don't want it. Why would I? She's not mine but your daughter!
Mam, your friend Anum is here to see you.
Anum is here?
Yes.
Alright. Make her sit. I'll just come.
Okay.
Hey.. What a pleasant surprise! How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine. Please sit..
Thank you so much.
You know, I wanted to meet you since so many days but I couldn't come.
I was missing you too. I thought I'd come see you when I'd be free.
Enough. Had you missed me, you'd have at least called but no.
Madam doesn't even have 10 minutes.
You could have at least called. See I wanted to meet you, I came.
You know I was so worried.
First the kidnapping, I was absolutely senseless.
I was worried dead about Ilham. And now Hamza. God knows whats wrong with him?
Why? What happened? What is it?
I don't know. He reacts weirdly. He's rude about everything.
I think he isn't the same man I knew.
I destroyed my whole life behind that guy. Just to make him mine.
Should I tell you something? You and Hamza are both alike.
Selfish. Indifferent. Do you know he's the same Hamza you did so much to get?
You did so many plannings. You created misunderstandings between Nawal and Hamza.
Then you accused Kabeer and Nawal falsely when they didn't have any affair.
Our Falak thought that someone is who rich and has all the luxuries in the world,
he is the happiest. Isn't it?
You enraged Kabeer and took a divorce from him so that you could marry Hamza.
Then you blamed everything on Nawal.
I don't understand, why I'm discussing all this with you?
It won't make a difference to you.
that's why I can only make you understand. I cannot do anything else.
Listen to whatever Hamza says.
Hamza.. You?!
Hamza you? When did you come?
Everybody was right about you but I didn't believe them.
Why did you do this to me?
I loved Nawal..
You know how many years I waited for her.
You destroyed everything.
What...
Why did you do this? Answer me. Why did you do this?
Hamza whats wrong with you? What are you saying? I don't understand anything.
I heard everything with my own ears Falak.
You turned me against Nawal.
God knows what you fed me and I used to argue with her.
I was such an idiot that I believed you.
Anum was talking about something else. You've misunderstood. Nothing like that happened.
Hamza.. I loved you Hamza..
Shut up. You fell in love with me? You're lying!
You did everything for money. You wanted my name. You wanted my status.
You turned me against Nawal.
You made me hate her.
If you wanted money, you should have told me. I'd have given them to you.
I didn't want anything Hamza. I just wanted you..
Stop with your nonsense...
You know how many years I lived without her?
You snatched away my love, my happiness. You destroyed everything..
I'll not forgive you..
Hamza what happened? Why are you so upset?
Everything is destroyed mom. You were right. Nazish was right. She trapped me.
She turned me against Nawal.
God knows what she fed me against her and I was such an idiot that I believed her.
She took Nawal away from me, mom..
She didn't even care for her sister who loved her. Who took care of her..
You're a selfish.. and ungrateful girl..
Hamza please I made a mistake. Hamza please..
Mom tell her to get lost from my sight or else I'll kill her.
Get lost! Go!
Falak, go to your room.
Hamza..
Hamza.. please compose yourself.
How can I compose myself?
I've lost everything. How did I believe what she said?
Nawal tried to make me understand.
She came to make me believe what she said but I didn't believe her.
Had I listened to her, she would have been with me, today.
Didn't I tell you, Nawal wasn't that type of a girl who could deceive you.
But what could we do? At that time,
You were not ready to believe anyone. We couldn't help it.
You're right. I should have believed you.
This girl was never right for you. She played one game after another. See,
the person that doesn't belong to his own family
he cannot be anybody's. She was never mother's.
Its because of these things that you understand a person's intentions.
I've never discussed such things with you,
but I tried to make you understand after what she did. But now you know..
Don't worry, everything will be alright. I'm with you. You're not alone.
You turned me against Nawal and made me hate her.
If you wanted money, you should have told me, I'd have given you.
I didn't want anything Hamza.. I just wanted you..
Stop with your nonsense. Do you know how many years I lived without her?
You snatched my love from me. You took away my happiness. You destroyed everything.
One sided love only hurts you, you get nothing.
I'd say you should stay here and show Nawal how happy you are in your life.
She should realize what she has lost.
Falak isn't a good girl. Someone who isn't sincere with her daughter,
how could she be sincere with you? Nawal is hundred times better than Falak.
Hamza, Nawal isn't home yet. I think she's at Kabeer's house.
Weren't you even a little bit ashamed to have an affair with your ex-wife's sister?
Enough Hamza! If you say another word. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
You must be mistaken. Its not as you think. I brought Falak here. She wanted to meet Ilham.
I am calling off my wedding with you.
You were right. Nazish was right. She trapped me. She turned me against Nawal.
God knows what nonsense she fed me and I was so stupid I believe everything.
She took me away from Nawal.
She destroyed her own sister who loved her, who cared for her. You are a selfish and ungrateful woman.
You're my blood. You would never take such a big step without my permission. I'm sure she turned you against me.
You will be upset when you will know her real face.
Her reality. She planned everything to turn you against me.
You were such a big businessman. Such stupidity doesn't suit you, Hamza.
Kabeer and I never had an affair. It was her plan.
She took me to Kabeer's house and then called you there. All of this is her doing.
Open your eyes and see whats happening with you!
If I wanted to have an affair, I would have had one when you left me.
She trapped you for her own benefits.
Hello Mr. Kabeer. I wanted to inform you something very important.
Yes, please tell me what is it?
Sher Khan has been caught.
This is a great news.
And he said it was Hamza who told him to do all this.
What? What did you say?
Hamza? Hamza Hashim?
What are you saying?
I called to tell you this. The one who got your daughter kidnapped is Hamza Hashim.
Hamza.. Sit here. I want to talk to you.
What happened? Why are you worried?
Its nothing.
Hamza, I'm your mother. I can read your face.
Its very clear that you're worried. Did Falak do something?
See whatever is happening. Only Falak isn't at fault. You're at fault too.
If a person gives someone else the power to decide for their life, this is what happens.
Sir, Hamza. The police is here. They want to meet you.
Police?
Call them inside.
Sure.
Yes Mr. SHO?
Mr. Hamza we have an arrest warrant for you.
what!
You'll have to come with us right now.
Why? What did my son do? Hamza? What is this?
What crime did my son commit?
Come.
You can say whatever you want in the police station..
Hamza, what are they doing?
Mam, sir Hamza has been arrested by the police..
What? Come on.
Hamza? Hamza? Where are you taking him? Aunty, stop them..
Its all because of you. You got this done.
What did I do?
Don't be so innocent. You got my son to kidnap your daughter.
What are you saying? Tell me what happened..
You're an ungrateful woman. I can expect anything from you.
 I said the first day you shouldn't have come here.
But my son wouldn't listen. Now see what happened. The police took him.
 Aren't you ashamed?
What are you saying? I have no idea about it.
You don't? Why would my son do it?
Not at all. You influenced him. You destroyed his life.
I didn't do anything aunty. Why are you blaming me? I don't know whats happening.
Its because of you, my daughter left the house and the police took my son!
What sort of a woman are you? You could never belong to anyone.
For God's sake, spare us. 
Get lost from my house and never come back. I don't want to see your face again.
What are you saying?
What else would I say?
 Is it my fault? My house.. its empty. Its quiet. Look at us!
What will you do? How much more will you eat away at our family?
You will have to leave my house, right here. Right now.
What are you saying aunty? Where will I go from this house? This is my husband's house.
This isn't your husband's house. Its my house. And you will have to leave. Shakoor.. Faheem..
Faiza.. Where are all of us? Throw her out of my house. Immediately.
Listen to me. Where will I go? I have no place to go.
What are you looking at my face for? Throw her out. And if she comes back again. Shoot her.
Aunty listen to me.. Please.. What are you doing? Where will I go?
There can not be another indifferent, selfish and cheap man like you.
You had enmity with us. 
Why did you bring our daughter in between? She's an innocent baby. 
What sort of a human being are you?
Thank God, you're behind the bars, Hamza. Or else I'd have killed you.
Mr. Kabeer, sir is calling you. He needs you to sign some papers.
You should be ashamed Hamza. 
What I thought about you and what you turned out to be?!
Such a low life? You fell so below that you would do anything to satisfy your ego?!
You were never like this. What did Falak turn you into?!
Look at yourself.
Your anger and Falak.. where did they get you? 
And you did everything because,
you wanted to harm me and Kabeer?
 I don't believe you would do all this.
I hate you. A deep hate..
I know I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
And the biggest mistake I made was to leave you.
I loved you very much Nawal...
Trust me.. I destroyed my love with my own hands.
When I left you.. I lost everything.
Respect.. Fame.. And love..
Everything..
Whatever happened is good. Very good. That you didn't come in my life.
I never deserved you.
 I feel very small in front of you.
Kabeer is a good guy. 
You deserve Kabeer. He should be in your life.
I know I'm not worth forgiving. 
But still, I apologize to you.
Just forgive me, once..
