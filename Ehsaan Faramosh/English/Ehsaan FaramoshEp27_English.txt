Please get well soon Touqeer. If something happens to you, I'll not be able to live.
Please compose yourself. If you lose courage, I'll be scattered.
I have a lot of courage and more than that I trust God.
He'll never let my house scatter.
Hafsa must be crying.
Falak is with her. Don't worry she'll handle her.
Please pray..
Everything will be alright. Please come outside. Come.
Yes Falak?
What are you doing?
Here. Nothing I'm giving old clothes to Zakia.
Why are you giving away these clothes? You must have worn these only once twice.
Yes but actually Hamza said so. I've shopped about ten times after I got engaged
so he said I should give away all old clothes and wear only new.
We've shopped so much and yet Hamza doesn't get tired. I do.
You tell me why haven't you slept yet?
I have no rest in my life. I just came back from the hospital.
What happened? Is everything alright?
brother Touqeer is in the hospital. He isn't well.
Yes, what happened to him?
He had a minor attack but he's fine now.
May God grant him health.
You know I was so worried thinking about whether we'll be able to make it to Hamza's dinner party or not.
We have a time of a week. He'll be better by then, don't worry.
I want to show you something, wait.
Here.. A minute.
Here. See this. These are diamonds. Hamza brought these for me from Dubai.
Its good.
Yes its good.
Actually Hamza spoils me a lot, Falak.
Alright, Nawal, I'm tired. We'll talk tomorrow. I'm sleeping.
Okay. Alright, take care.
Bye.
I'll get you something to eat.
Please rest. You were in the hospital all night. I'll cook.
Falak is right.
Aaliya go and look into things yourself. Let Falak be
and where is Hafsa?
I gave her food. She's asleep.
I want to rest. Please turn off the lights.
Please go ahead, we have no objection.
This is good. Nazish and her kids need their visas stamped and the kids have their exams next month.
Maybe their might be a little delay.
Alright. As you think better.
Hamza and I wanted to get everything done quickly but she's his only sister
and you know how many dreams sisters have for their brother's wedding.
She couldn't come for the engagement and the wedding now is out of the question without her.
Yes of course I understand.
I've asked Nawal to start making preparations gradually.
She will take about one and a half months to get everything done.
And yet we'll have something to do on the last day.
This is great. In fact I'll tell Hamza for the wedding dress,
he should place an order for that. We'll get the work done.
You're absolutely right.
You should have brought Nawal along. The house lightens up when she's around.
I would have brought her but since she has started a new job, she's busy.
Its good. Its good that she works rather than being idle at home.
Please have something.
Of course. I'll do.
Mr. Arif isn't here yet. He had to be here. I cannot see him around.
Sir, I wanted to call and confirm but his number was off.
Number is off?
Are the cheques cleared?
Yes sir, they were cleared yesterday.
Then what is the problem? He had a site visit with him and his number is never off. Oh well, you can leave.
Hammad? We had a meeting with Mr. Arif.
We're trying to call him but his number is off. Call him and find out.
Yes tell me?
He went to Dubai? All of a sudden.
How is that possible? We had a meeting.
What?
When? What are you saying Hammad?
You said they were very good people. Trustworthy.
Hammad I paid him 50 million. He cleared his cheques yesterday.
But you knew them well. Hammad what are you saying?
I don't understand what to do now. Alright. Hangup.
How can it be?
How could I trust Hammad?
May God give health to Toqueer.
Has he ever had an attack before?
No. Its the first time.
I was so upset myself.
We were talking and he had this pain.
His color started turning pale.
So what have the doctors said?
Doctors are saying that he was stressed.
Diseases today are like this. They make a person weak from the inside and we never know.
You're right.
And there are a few diseases that we get ourselves.
He unknowingly make mistakes and then we have to suffer.
Hello.
Hello. How are you dear?
I'm fine. Excuse me.
Alright, Aaliya, please allow us to leave.
Oh no. Please eat before you leave. I'll get dinner started.
No. We're not hungry. We came to ask after brother Toqueer. Take care of him.
Take care of yourself as well.
I really appreciate you coming over. Thank you.
May God give you strength.
Kabeer, you haven't changed yet?
Kabeer?
What happened? Why do you look so worried?
Nothing.
I'm not worried. You tell me.
No tell me. I've never seen you like this ever.
Yes I had invested in a business.
He turned out to be a fraud.
What? He was your friend.
The company was someone else's. My friend and I invested together.
Oh.. Fraud.. How much money was it?
50 million?
Oh God.
Falak.. Don't mention this to brother Toqueer.
You know his condition.
He will be uselessly worried.
This isn't something to be hidden. He'll find one day or the other.
We'll see about it then
but right now don't mention anything to him. I don't want him to be worried because of me.
Toqueer, what have you thought?
About what?
Will you tell Kabeer about Falak?
He should know the truth.
Whatever was happening in the house, Falak was responsible for it. Not me.
Aaliya do you remember the last time Falak left home?
Remember how Kabeer was.
I'm scared that if I tell him the truth, he'll not be able to bear the truth.
He is already worried because of me
and frankly speaking, I don't want to worry him anymore.
You know how much I love him. How dear he is for me.
Aaliya I don't want to put him through a test that he has already appeared for. I'm sorry.
But he'll find the truth one day or the other.
What will you answer then?
He will question. He will ask us why we didn't tell him when we knew the truth.
What will you say then? Do you have any answer?
Aaliya you have to understand this.
Kabeer's married life will be destroyed.
Falak is a liar and cheat. She wanted to destroy the peace of this house. She did so much to show me down.
And now when you know her truth, you want to let it go?
Kabeer, is very dear to us and because of that we know that he doesn't deserve a girl like Falak.
Do you know,
not calling out wrong as wrong is wrong too.
Alright. If you don't want to tell, then don't.
Where I've been insulted so much, we can see how it goes if we stay quiet. But remember this.
Falak will never rectify her behavior. She'll make Kabeer's life hell.
Kabeer.
How do I look?
Stunning.
You didn't have this necklace before.
Yes I got a new one. Is it beautiful?
Falak, are you mad?
This is a diamond necklace.
You should have asked me before buying such an expensive necklace.
Would you say yes if I had asked you? I liked it so I bought it.
Obviously.
Falak I told you about my business loss and I told you to be careful with the money in your account. I could need it in bad times.
And yet you bought such an expensive necklace without asking me. Its the limit of stupidity.
Kabeer can I not do anything as I like?
Will I have to ask you for everything?
What is it if I bought something I liked?
Falak, we'll talk about it later, once we're back.
I'm not going anywhere Kabeer. You spoiled my mood.
I cannot buy anything I like and you'll not get me anything I like.
This isn't the life you showed me dreams about.
Don't be so emotional. We're getting late. Lets go.
I don't want to go anywhere. You can go.
Okay. I'm sorry. I was very rude.
They're waiting. Please come on. Lets go.
Where are you? You're not here yet.
See, they're already there.
Lets go. They're waiting.
Hello everyone. Meet my fiance, Nawal.
My love, my soul mate.
We've known each other since long. We studied in college together.
But we drifted apart for a little while.
Falak, why are you sitting here alone?
I'm not feeling well, that's why.
Come, lets talk to everyone. Meet people. You'll get bored sitting here.
Please go ahead. I'm not coming right now.
Nawal.. I want you to meet someone.
Alright. Give me two minutes.
Alright.
Kabeer?
Excuse me.
Yes?
I want to go home.
What happened Falak? So soon.
If we leave the party, what will Hamza and Nawal think?
I don't care what anybody thinks.
I want to go home. Are you coming or should I leave?
Falak
why are you creating a scene?
People are watching. Wait, we'll go in a while.
Falak.. Falak.. What is your problem? Why are you creating a scene?
Kabeer I'm not feeling well, really. I'm feeling dizzy. I cannot sit anymore.
You stay if you like. Get me a cab. I'll go.
Alright. Lets go.
Nawal, what are you doing here?
I cannot find Falak or Kabeer anywhere. I've tried calling but nobody is answering.
They'll be here somewhere. I'll ask someone, they'll see.
If you had to do all this, you shouldn't have gone there.
It was so embarrassing for me Falak, leaving the party in the middle, in front of everyone.
Kabeer didn't you see, I wasn't feeling well.
Falak don't make excuses. You didn't want to go in the first place.
If you think that is so, so be it.
Falak, what will Hamza and Nawal think about us?
It was so embarrassing. I cannot tell you how embarrassed I am after what you did.
Exactly. You care about everyone except me.
As it is Kabeer, I didn't ask you to come. You came yourself. Oh God, my head..
New drama.
Hello.
Hello. How was your dinner last night?
It was good.
Did Falak and Kabeer come?
Yes they did come for a while but I don't know they left. They didn't even tell.
You didn't even ask.
I called Falak quite a few times but she didn't answer.
Its surprising.
She was behaving weirdly. She was sitting all alone. Please ask.
Something must have happened between them.
I'll ask. Don't worry. Have breakfast.
Mom I'll be a little late. Hamza said we'll have a meeting with the designer for the bridal dress.
All praise to the Lord.
Alright, please call Falak and make her understand.
I will. You have your breakfast.
No. Just an apple.
Bye. Take care dear.
Touqeer? Yes?
Should I ask you something?
Ask.
Did you talk to Kabeer about Falak?
No. Why?
I think both of them have had an argument.
Both of them were in a bad mood last night. I noticed.
I thought you told Kabeer about Falak.
I didn't say anything else.
By the way how did you know Falak isn't Sultana's own daughter but an adopted child?
I went to a get together. Fariha, Sultana's sister in law was there too. I found out there but,
what difference does it make? You don't want to tell Kabeer then why ask?
Just like that.
It won't take time for the ground below your feet to vanish
if I tell your in laws that you're Sultana's adopted daughter.
How did you know that Falak is Sultana's adopted daughter?
I went to a get together where Sultana's sister in law, Fariha was there.
Falak? What happened?
Kabeer..
Falak? Falak? What happened?
I felt dizzy.
Come. Come inside.
What happened all of a sudden?
Sit down.
Why are you crying? What is it?
I feel as if I'll die.
What are you saying? Don't think about it. You're fine. In fact,
you should rest, you'll be fine. Drink some water.
Where are you going?
I'm calling the doctor.
Please sit with me, I'll be alright.
If Kabeer finds out your truth, what will happen to you Falak?
Listen?
Yes?
Where is Kabeer?
He is in Aaliya's room. He was talking to Toqueer.
What were they talking?
I don't know. I went to give them water but I didn't pay attention.
Get lost. Don't show me your face. What should I do?
If Toqueer tells him about me.. What will happen to me? What should I do?
Oh God..
Kabeer? Where were you?
I was in Touqeer's room.
Is everything alright?
Yes. All good.
Kabeer, can you take me out somewhere? I feel suffocated here. Can we go?
Alright. Lets go.
Is everything alright? What were you discussing with Touqeer?
Everything is alright. We were just discussing business, what else?
You tell me, will you have ice cream?
Good idea.
Then lets go.
I'll have to do something. If Kabeer finds out, he'll stop respecting me.
I will not let Aaliya destroy everything so easily.
Its good that you took breakfast in Aaliya's room. Everybody's heart is clear now.
I always want to live together. Maybe she has a misunderstanding.
Its good. All misunderstandings have been cleared.
I'm getting late for work. I'll drop you at your mother's.
Aaliya, I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm getting late, I'll talk to you when I'm back from work.
Are you upset with me?
Why will I be upset?
Then why aren't you talking to me? I've been noticing that you're ignoring me.
I noticed in the morning as well. You and Touqeer avoided talking to me.
Its nothing. You're mistaken.
Aaliya, I'm ashamed at whatever I did.
I did wrong with you. I have now realized.
 God knows what I said to you. I was so ill mannered. I shouldn't have done it.
Will you forgive me? You can punish me as you like. I've made a lot of mistakes.
I don't know what I held against you. You're so nice. 
You never complained to Kabeer against me.
Neither you said anything to Toqueer. 
You had a clean heart. I was a lowlife.
Please forgive me, thinking of me as your younger sister.
Falak..
You've realized your mistake. I'm happy.
I have always thought of you as my younger sister. I've never hated you. 
To be honest, whatever you said, hurt me.
I know. That's why I'm apologizing that this will never happen again. 
I hurt you. Please forgive me.
God has changed your heart, its great. Do you know?
Touqeer used to say that Falak would understand one day and I never believed him.
But I was wrong. Touqeer is right.
 God can give anybody a change of heart, anywhere, anytime.
Did you forgive me?
I should have understood from the very beginning. 
We would have lived peacefully. Nothing would have happened.
Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Love can change everything.
Kabeer I'm sorry. I was so rude that night. You were right that,
we shouldn't have left the event and come.
Its okay.
Whenever you're free, tell me. I'll pick you.
Are you not coming inside?
No. I have an important work. Tell me whenever you're free, I'll be there.
Sure.
I am so happy that you thought about Nawal. 
If God keeps everything alright, you'll be done with her responsibility with ease.
Then you'll have no excuse that you cannot leave the house because of the girls.
 I'll take you with me. We'll plan a world tour.
Thank God, God is making me fulfill responsibilities for both my daughters.
Now tell me, has Safdar transferred the amount?
Yes, thank you so much. I've received the money.
Let me know if you need more money. Don't hesitate. 
I want Nawal's wedding to be a grand affair. She's like my daughter too.
Yes of course.
Hello.
Hello, my dear.
What is she doing here?
Its good that you met me here. I wanted to come to your house.
She forgot her phone.
 I'll have to go back.
Falak, what is this way to talk to your aunt?
Mom, I'm talking the way she deserves to be talked to.
Falak what happened? Why are you angry?
Weren't you ashamed of doing this even once? 
Mom do you know who told Aaliya about my adoption?
She did. The one who is standing in front of me.
No Falak. You must be mistaken. Aunt didn't talk to Aaliya.
I'm not mistaken.
 I know everything. She told her. 
I heard Aaliya telling Touqeer that I wasn't Sultana's blood daughter but an adopted child.
