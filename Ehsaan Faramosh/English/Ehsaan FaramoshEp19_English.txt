Mom..
My doll..
My dear, you didn't come and meet me?
Dad said not to disturb you. Mom what happened to you?
Nothing. I'm absolutely fine now.
Mom, why were you locked up in your room since so many days.
You didn't come out. I wanted to play with you. Nobody took me out.
Even your uncle didn't take you?
Aunt doesn't like it so he didn't take me.
So lets do one thing. I'll take you out.
When?
Today. Right now.
Really mom?
My dear. Nasreen, get her clothes. Get her ready. Ask the driver to get the car ready, we'll leave.
Alright mam. Do you want me to iron your dress?
Yes. Of course. Hurry up. And when did you make this. I didn't see it.
Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you? Please come and sit.
I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
I'm Hamza's mother.
You know Hamza. Nawal works for him in his office.
Yes I know.
Its good. I'll not drag it. Actually,
I brought a proposal for Nawal from Hamza. Hamza wants to marry her.
But Nawal doesn't want to marry him.
She doesn't want to hear Hamza's name.
I know. Even Hamza knows.
Whatever happened in the past, he has apologized to Nawal a lot of times but,
I'm a mother like you. He's embarrassed but he loves Nawal very much. He'll keep her happy.
Please ask Nawal to end this separation. It will be for the best. Ask her to forgive Hamza.
I'll talk to Nawal. I'll try to make her understand.
And I'll tell you what she says.
My son is not bad.
He is a good human being. He made a mistake and he is repenting it.
I understand what you're saying. I'll talk to Nawal.
But I'll not force her.
I have seen the consequences of forcing her once. My daughter has been hurt.
I understand what you're saying.
But I hope if you talk, everything will be alright. We'll meet again, soon. If God wills.
But you didn't even have tea.
Please sit, I'll get tea.
No please don't be formal. Next time we'll have sweets. Alright?
I'll take you leave. Bye.
I'm a lot better. I'm fine now. I'll join from tomorrow.
Please keep my meetings for the second half.
I'm good. Okay. Bye.
Oh wow. You're getting ready to go to work.
Yes. I've been in my room for long.
I've thought I'll get worried if I let this problem worry me.
I just made a mistake Falak.
I thought my enemy was weak and I lost.
Its good.
Human beings make mistake. Be careful next time.
I have put in a lot of love and hard work to make this house, a home.
I will not let you break this house apart so easily.
God forbid, what are you saying.
This house is mine as much as its yours. Why would I break it?
Falak, I'm waiting for you outside and you're talking to sister Aalia.
Sister Aalia, how are you now?
I'm fine. You tell me, hows work?
Everything is going fine but we miss you there.
I'll join tomorrow by the grace of God. I've rested enough. I need to work.
Do you know, as much as Falak looked after me, she cared for me, that's why I'm up on my feet so soon.
I think if it had been my own sister, she wouldn't have cared for me so much. Isn't it Falak?
Thank you so much.
I'm so pleased to see you so fresh and healthy.
Are you people going somewhere?
Yes we're going out.
Alright. Take Falak on a long drive first and then dinner.
Falak loves long drives. Isn't it?
Whatever you say. Lets go Falak.
Now won't you meet me before you leave?
Enjoy.
Bye.
You know I won't marry him even if he's the last man on Earth.
Don't make such tall claims.
If someone is coming to your doorstep again and again
and if you aren't finding anybody else, what does this mean?
This means, this is God's way of bringing you together.
You know what he did with me and still you're saying this?
I know. He made a mistake and now he is repenting.
See dear, if someone apologizes, don't hold them accountable.
Its best if you forgive them.
I will forgive him but I'll not marry him.
Then don't.
Don't marry him. But take time and think about your decision.
Think about it first, understand and I'll accept whatever decision you make.
When someone is coming to your doorstep again and again, and you're not finding anybody else what does it mean?
It means its God's way of bringing you together. He made a mistake.
And now he's repenting.
If someone apologizes, don't hold them accountable.
Hello?
Even when I said no, why did you send your mom? You know my answer.
I know but I don't accept it and neither will I ever accept your no.
I know Nawal, you're hurt and upset with me. I promise I'll make everything alright.
Just trust me once.
How? How can I trust you?
What if you break my trust once again?
I promise I'll never break it again.
Just give me a chance.
I gathered myself with a lot of difficulty.
I don't have the strength to go through pain once again.
Nawal I'll make up for whatever pain I caused you.
I'll love you so much that you'll forget everything.
Its all talks. Nobody can make up for the pain they caused in the past.
Just give me one chance and listen to me. We can sort this out together.
Please Nawal. Meet me once. Please.
I'll wait for you at the same place tomorrow. The same place we used to meet.
If you still think that we cannot be together, I'll not come in your way again. I promise.
Hello Ms. Nawal. How are you?
Move out of my way.
Oh, so Mr. Hamza is here as well?
Now I understand everything. Whatever you had with me was a drama. You had an affair with him.
You were cheating on me. You needed an excuse and as soon as you found one, you called it off. Isn't it?
I am not answerable to you. Think whatever you want to think.
You broke it off. I didn't.
Whatever you're dreaming about, I'll not let you fulfill it.
Leave her hand. How dare you touch her?
If I see you near her again, I'll spoil your face.
Hamza.
If I want, I'll kill the two of you right here.
I think you don't hold your life dear. Its best if you keep your gun inside.
Or else my guards will fire at you.
I'll see the two of you.
Let him go.
Nawal? Its alright. He's gone.
Don't be scared.
You don't have to be scared when I'm here. I'm with you.
I want to go home.
Its alright. Come with me. I'll drop you.
No. I'll go myself.
You come with me. They'll bring your car.
Come on. Its okay. Come.
Thank you.
Bye.
The servant was telling me that Touqeer took you to a psychiatrist?
But you said no to the check up.
What has your condition become in a few days?
An empty mind is a devil's workshop.
What do you keep thinking all day? Why don't you do anything productive?
So that you can do something good for yourself and others.
What will you get like this except destroying people and your own self?
You're so upset. Your moves overturned on you.
You're always thinking about one thing.
What if Kabeer leaves us?
Kabeer will not go anywhere, no matter how much you try and I believe it.
You will not succeed in your attempts. I know how to answer you well.
But the problem is I cannot fall down to your level. Its not in my upbringing.
Don't worry. All your misunderstandings will be cleared in a few days.
I'll not let you take over my husband, sister Aaliya.
I understand everything. Whatever you had with me was a drama. You had an affair with him.
I'll never let you fulfill the dreams you're having.
Leave her hand. How dare you touch her? If I see you near her, ever again, I'll destroy you.
What are you thinking Nawal?
Mom, I went to meet Hamza. I met Asjad there. He drew out a pistol.
Pistol?
Thank God Hamza was with me. God knows what would have happened then.
You went to meet Hamza without telling me.
What was Asjad doing there?
Will you take decisions without telling me?
I.. am nothing mom.
And whatever happened today, I'm scared mom.
I went to meet Hamza because he forced me but I don't know where Asjad came from.
Nawal thats why I want you to get married.
Nawal, a woman needs security.
And that security can only be provided by a man.
My life isn't to be trusted anymore. I might be not around to see tomorrow.
That's why I want you to get married while I'm alive. I'm just scared.
Don't think I think of you as a burden. I'm your mother.
A mother's heart is bound by her worries for her children.
I cannot leave you in this society to fend for yourself.
Don't worry, I'm very strong. I can compete with the whole world.
No matter how strong a woman is.
She is weaker than a man.
I'm not scaring you.
I'm trying to make you understand.
We have to think over a lot of things.
Falak is now married. I want you to get married too while I'm alive.
How dare you touch her? If I see you near her ever again, I'll destroy you.
Nawal I know I wronged you.
Can it not be that we move forward like we were? Forgetting everything?
Nawal a woman needs security and only a man can provide her that security.
My life cannot be trusted. I might not be here to see tomorrow.
That's why I want you to get married in my life Nawal.
That's the only thing I want.
No matter how strong a woman is, she's always weaken than a man.
See Falak is now married.
I want to see you married while I'm still alive.
Who are you people? What are you doing in my house?
Are you Asjad?
Yes I'm Asjad.
We have a warrant against you?
Warrant? What Warrant?
You harass woman on the road and now you're acting innocent about the warrant? Lets go.
Let me talk to my lawyer.
Lets go to the police station and then talk to your lawyer.
Where are you taking him? Leave him. Leave him. Whats wrong?
I don't understand anything
Dear, I wanted you to stay here forever.
To tell you the truth, I loved it here but its another thing that,
sometimes some wishes just stay wishes.
Alright, I'll leave now. Its time for my flight.
Have a safe flight. Take care and keep calling me.
Sure
Give my regards to everyone.
Okay, travel safe
Nawal? Nawal?
Yes?
Nausheen called. She said Asjad was arrested.
So what should we do if he's arrested? We're not related to them.
And why did she call you?
She wanted to ask if Nawal launched a police complaint.
You don't have to answer her call.
I told you earlier as well.
We don't want to get involved with the police.
I didn't file a complaint. Don't answer if she calls again.
Okay.
Mom..
Yes?
Did Sofia aunty call?
Don't worry.
I know you don't want to marry Hamza. I'll tell her your answer when she calls.
Do you think I should trust a person who broke my trust once?
I'll just tell you to ask this question to yourself.
Ask your heart, whether,
it can forgive Hamza for this? Who does not make a mistake?
But the position Hamza is at,
he doesn't lack girls. Why is he hopeful for you? Hamza let his love down once.
He's repenting now. Don't make the mistake he did.
Think about it and make a decision.
I'll support you in whatever decision you make.
But I want you to think about it so that you don't have any guilt about anything.
Nawal, I'll make up for all the pain I caused you.
I'll love you so much that you'll forget everything.
Alright.
You can tell Sofia aunty that I have no objections against marrying Hamza.
Nawal? My child. May you always be happy. I'm very happy for you.
You've taken away all my worries. My heart is now free of all burdens. May you be happy always.
Why are you crying now?
Yes? Please check the inventory.
Okay, thank you.
Kabeer, who were you talking to?
Nothing. I had a call from work. The inventory is here so they were informing.
Hello mom. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine as well.
I haven't talked to you since so many days. I thought I'd call and ask about you.
You tell me, how are Kabeer and Aaliya treating you?
How would they be? They're the same.
Leave me. It'll be the same. Tell me how is sister Nawal.
Nawal is fine as well.
We are considering the proposal that was here for her. We have to go to their house so,
I was thinking if you could come with me. Its good if you could see your sister's in laws.
You go ahead, is it important for me to go?
Of course it is. You're her sister.
They're good people and I like them. Nawal also likes them. You should come along so that we can move things ahead.
Alright. If you're insisting, I'll come but I don't have time.
I wanted Safdar and Fariha to be with me as well.
But Fariha said she'll be here in a few days so we should look into matters until then.
Alright mom. I'll come.
Alright. Bye.
Bye.
Come fast. We're getting late.
Mom. Stop.
Who are they? What do they do? Where are we going? Why the suspense?
His name is Hamza Hashim. They're educated people.
Hamza Hashim. Hashim Industry's owner?
Yes.
His mother brought a proposal some time ago.
Nawal is going to a very good house, like you. All by the grace of God.
What are you thinking now? Come along. We're getting late.
Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine.
Did you find the house easily?
Yes there was no problem.
This is my younger daughter, Falak.
Alright.
Hello aunty.
Hello dear. Come and sit. Please sit down.
Sit dear.
Yes.
Your daughter is very beautiful, she looks like a doll. Is she Kabeer's wife?
Yes.
I haven't talked to Aaliya since a few days. She's a remarkable woman. I'm very inspired by her. She handles her business and the house so well.
Amazing. Amazing. Its a very difficult thing to balance everything. You would know.
Yes of course.
Your house is beautiful. Everything seems branded as if its imported from abroad.
Yes a lot of things are imported.
I love the interior of your house.
I'm sure, you must have done it.
No I didn't do it myself dear but the idea and concept was mine.
I'm impressed.
In fact I love your house too dear. Aaliya has done it up so well.
No. Its nothing compared to this house. I'll go and tell sister Aaliya,
to get classes from you.
She talks lovely.
Hamza is not to be seen?
Yes he went to the office for a few meetings but I told him you were coming.
Had I known you were bringing a good news, I'd have stopped him.
You are absolutely right. We have no objection on the proposal. Congratulations.
Thank you. I'm so happy. Hamza will be ecstatic. You honored me. This is such a good news.
Now see, we'll not take time for any event. We'll get it done as soon as possible.
As you say.
Let Hamza come. I'll talk to him and we'll finalize everything.
So dear, come along, I have a good news for you.
Really? What is it?
Sultana came. They have agreed your proposal for Nawal.
What? Are you telling the truth?
Thank you so much. I'm so happy. I now have the biggest happiness in my life.
Dear, I'm so happy for you. Your life will be stable now.
I was worried when I saw you alone.
Thank you so much. I love you.
Its all because of you. Had you not been along. Your son, who has been successful in all walks of life,
would have lost his love.
You know, their childrens' happiness is the most precious thing for parents.
You're my only son. I can do anything for your happiness.
Thank you. I can see that.
Thank you so much.
