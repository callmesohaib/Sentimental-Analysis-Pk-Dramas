Oh, Kabeer, you? You're back early.
Where were you?
I had some work. Why? What happened now?
Have you forgotten you have a small daughter? Are you so careless?
You left your daughter and went to run errands.
Noor is here. I told her to take care of her. Why is she here for?
Its your responsibility to take care of her or someone else?
Enough Kabeer. I should know what has happened?
Ilham was unwell. I took her to the hospital in an emergency.
I've been calling you. Your phone has been off.
Yes, the battery died. Its not the end of the world. You were there, you took her to the hospital.
And as it is Kabeer, I take care of her for the whole day. What if you took care of her for a day?
Falak do you even realize?
How are you talking to me? Rather than accepting your mistake, you're putting it on me.
Enough Kabeer. Its enough.
Have you forgotten, I'm not your maid but your wife. I have a life of my own.
What do you want? Should I stay at home all the time?
There's a limit to everything and you'll not cross your limit the next time!
Falak!
What happened? Hit me now. Why did you stop? Hit me now.
I should know what you have in your heart for me.
You have so much pent up anger!
Falak..
Do you have any idea how worried Kabeer and I were.
We had to take Ilham straight to emergency.
Do you even know how much your negligence would have cost you?
Please Falak, correct yourself.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
Enough. Whats wrong? Why are you talking like Kabeer? I don't go out every day.
I had some important work that's why I had to step out for a while.
Then why didn't you tell before leaving and why was your phone off?
Mam, Ilham is up.
Go and take care of your daughter. Give her medicine on time. I'm leaving, I'm getting late.
Why are you standing and looking at my face? Couldn't you take care of a baby?
Sir the company has rejected our demand for an inquiry.
Do whatever it takes Mr. Qureshi. I need this contract back.
Sir, I had asked you to meet Mr. Qaiser but you said no yourself.
There's no use meeting with him.
Sir after you left for Canada, the work progress slowed down.
We couldn't build the facility on time. Its our fault. The company is right.
If we file a case against them.
Sir I discussed with our legal team. They said we'd be wasting our time and money both.
The points on the basis of which the contract was pulled off, they're absolutely valid.
Alright. You leave, I'll see.
Okay sir.
I will never let you win.
I don't say anything because you're not well and you might get even more worried
but I'm surprised that,
sister Nawal didn't tell you anything. She didn't even tell you what happened yesterday.
Yesterday?
What happened yesterday?
Kabeer hit me in front of sister Nawal.
What?! How dare he hit you?!
I swear mom, I didn't say a word.
I apologized.
This has been increasing every day. Something happens everyday.
I don't say anything. He knows,
who will come after me to ask and question. He thinks I'm an orphan.
I'm alive right now. I'm your mother.
How dare he hit you? I would break his arm.
Had I known he would treat you like a caveman after he takes you from here, I wouldn't have let him.
Let it be mom. We cannot judge a person's traits by his face.
Get up. Get up and come with me. I'll go and ask him right away. He made such tall claims.
Has he forgotten everything? Come on, Falak.
Where are you going?
Yesterday, Kabeer slapped Falak in front of you.
And you didn't event tell me.
How dare he? Why didn't you bring back Falak that very instant Nawal!
Kabeer did not slap Falak. She's lying.
What are you saying?
I'm right mom.
Speak up!
Kabeer misbehaved with me in front of you. Why are you trying to save him?
Falak neither Kabeer misbehaved with you nor did he slap you.
In fact you were misbehaving with him. You provoked him.
Why did you leave Ilham and go?
Didn't you know she was unwell?
You show such careless behavior and you expect the other person to not be angry.
Falak, what am I hearing?
Mom, this is a lie.
I don't tell you anything because you people will never believe me.
I have realized today, why do we need blood relations.
They believe you and support you when you need them.
You people have turned me into a liar in a second.
Tell me why would I lie? What will I get by lying?
Falak you know very well that I don't support wrong.
This time you're wrong. I was there. I heard everything.
Had you been my sister by blood would you have said the same thing?
You would have gone with me and asked him why he did that? I am wrong.
I have no complaints from you and mom. I'll not come back here again.
Mom let it be. I've realized. No matter how much I try..
I will never be her sister or your daughter..
Let her go mom. She turns us into strangers in a second. We brought her up.
You come with me.
What is it? Are you worried?
I'm thinking about Falak and Kabeer.
Day by day the arguments between them are increasing.
I don't know what Falak is made of.
She doesn't bother about her daughter or her husband.
Aaliya, some people are like that.
No matter how much you make them understand, their habits will never change.
Unfortunately Falak is one of them.
I will just tell you to let her be.
You know her habits.
What if she blames everything on you?
You're the limit.
Rather than telling me how to help them decrease their arguments, you're scaring me.
Aaliya their arguments will only end when God will guide Falak to the right path.
Falak isn't one of those girls who would like to settle down. Why don't you get that?
No matter how much Kabeer tries, their arguments will never end
What are you saying?
Come on, you know they are a mismatch.
Both of them have different habits.
A person marries to get peace and if there's no peace, a marriage is useless.
I am worried about Ilham.
She's not even looking after her.
She isn't worried about her daughter.
What do you mean?
When the child grows up and sees her parents fighting, how will she be affected?
Have you ever thought about it?
Aaliya such children are never mentally stable.
God forbid if this happens.
Just pray that may God guide Falak.
Amen.
I heard everything you people said.
You people feel so much pain for me.
I am teary eyed listening to all this. You worry about me so much.
Both of you want peace in this house? I'll tell you how we can be peaceful.
Get your stuff together and leave the house.
If you want to see Kabeer and me happy, we'll be happy if you both leave. As it is,
both of you make us argue a lot. We will not fight then.
What nonsense is this?
Whatever you're hearing. Am I wrong?
Are you in your senses? Look at the tone of your voice.
I'm in my senses. In fact I should have talked like this ages ago.
You want us to be peaceful. Be good and leave.
Falak I'm telling you to not cross your limits.
What did I say to upset you?
He's your only brother. Don't you want him to be happy?
Don't you want Kabeer to be happy?
Its the limit Falak. This house belongs to all of us.
You're mistaken.
My husband spent money to build this house. My husband. Its my house. You have forcibly taken over.
Mind your tongue. Mind it..
Toqueer don't argue with her. Come with me.
Where are you going inside? Go that way. That's where you go out from.
How dare you talk to my brother and sister Aaliya like this?
Kabeer they want to separate us..
Enough!
Its enough. Not a word more.
I heard everything myself. No more lies will work Falak.
Will you throw them out? You'll show them out?
Kabeer listen to me. Kabeer its not that..
I made the biggest mistake of my life marrying you.
But then I made an even bigger mistake bringing you back in this house.
Falak you don't deserve to be in this house. Come on.
Leave me. Where are you taking me?
I'm taking you back to your house. You'll not live here now.
Kabeer what are you doing? Leave me. I'll live here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I've never been so insulted in my life.
sister Aaliya, please don't cry. She'll not live here.
I'm sending her back to her house.
Nothing is important to me than your respect.
Get out. Go back to your house.
Don't throw me out. Please listen to be Kabeer.
If you want to live here, you'll have to apologize to my brother and sister in law or else there's no place for you in this house.
Kabeer please stop it. You've made enough spectacle.
No brother. I cannot be quiet all the time.
She will have to apologize today or else she can go. There's no place for her in this house.
Kabeer please forgive me. Please..
sister Aaliya, brother Toqueer please forgive me. I don't know what happened to me. I blabbered because I was angry. Next time,
I'll not even say a word. Please ask Kabeer to not throw me out. Please forgive me.
brother Toqueer, please ask him to forgive me.
Nawal, call Falak and ask about her.
Mom, stop pampering her.
You know how emotional she is. She left in anger.
I don't know how she'll honor her relationships.
I am worried about her house.
Mom, she wants you to turn a blind eye to her mistakes.
You should make her understand to stop going outside and stay at home and look after Ilham.
I'm scared that if Falak keeps on doing this, her life will be difficult in the future.
Go out. Go back to your house.
Don't throw me out Kabeer. Kabeer listen to me.
If you want to live here, you'll have to apologize to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer.
Otherwise there's no place for you in this house.
sister Aaliya, brother Toqueer please forgive me. I don't know what happened to me. I'll not say a word next time.
Please forgive me. Ask Kabeer to not throw me out. Please forgive me.
I will avenge my insult. I'll not forgive you.
Falak you're fighting this battle alone now. Nobody is yours.
Don't think about anyone. I'll do what I want to do.
Hello aunty.
Hello Hamza. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine, thank God.
Where is Nawal? I called her many times but she didn't answer.
Nawal isn't home.
Really? Where did she go?
Nawal must be in the office.
Office? Which office?
Didn't Nawal tell you?
Actually she has joined Kabeer's office.
Really?
She didn't tell me anything.
She joined since the past two weeks. Come inside I'll get you tea.
No auntie. I'll come some other day and have tea as well.
I'll leave now.
Alright. As you wish.
Bye.
Bye.
Hamza, you here?
If I ask the same thing from you. What are you doing here?
Hamza I was about to tell you.
Tell me? When?
You have been working here for the past two weeks and you didn't even mention it to me.
Now right now, resign and come with me.
Hamza..
You go. We'll meet in the evening and talk.
No.
We will talk right now and you will resign today.
Hamza I can't do that.
This is not professional at all.
I have a commitment. I cannot leave a job because you said so.
You'll teach me professionalism now?
You're Hamza Hashim's fiance.
You don't have to work for a cheap company. And if someone says something to you..
Tell me, I'll handle them. You come with me.
This is my office.
You don't have to create a scene here. Leave quietly.
You are a very cheap man.
When I didn't invest in your company, you gave my fiance a job?
I have not seen a cheap man like you in my life.
She will not come to the office from tomorrow.
Come.
Hamza, I'm not coming with you right now. You leave.
I will not give him what he wants from me, through you.
Nawal, you come with me. You have no work here. Come.
I'm warning you for the last time.
Leave my office. Now.
Alright.
I'll see how long she works for you.
I'm so sorry. This is so embarrassing. I really..
Nawal its all good. Relax.
Nawal..
Yes mom?
Hamza came over. Didn't you tell him about your job?
I talked to him. I've told him.
That's why..
I think he didn't like you hiding your job from him.
Mom, I didn't hide.
I didn't get a chance to tell him.
Now that you've told him, I hope his anger calms down.
How are you feeling now?
I'm fine. Did you talk to Falak?
No.
I'll call her myself.
I'll try.
I just want to talk. She isn't answering my calls.
What happened? Nawal? Are you worried?
Nothing much. Its just,
Hamza doesn't like me working for Kabeer.
Hamza?
Since when did Hamza become so conservative?
Mom we never know whats hidden inside a person.
We see people change color gradually.
Give her to me mam, I'll give her milk.
No. Keep this here and go check on the kitchen. I'll handle.
Alright.
Are you hungry? Are you?
We'll have milk now. Okay?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello my cutoo baby. How are you?
Where is Falak?
I think she went out for some work.
Out? Did you call her?
No. I thought she'd come back in a while. She'll be back soon.
What happened dear?
Hello?
Hello?
Can I talk to Falak?
Falak is busy shooting right now.
What did you say? Shoot?
Which shoot?
She's shooting for a drama. Please call back after an hour.
Who is this speaking?
This is Maria.
Do you even realize how much I've been worried because of this?
Hamza I don't understand why are you weighing this small thing so much?
Small? Is this a small matter for you?
This is a big issue for me. But oh well. Its good that you've resigned.
I didn't resign and nor do I intend you.
Why didn't you? I told you I don't like you working there.
You know Kabeer and I have clashes and yet you're working for him
Hamza you'll have to understand. Kabeer isn't a stranger.
He is my sister's husband and we're family.
Secondly they requested me because they needed someone.
I agree and I don't think you should have a problem with it.
Tell me one thing. Why are you always standing with my competitors?
First Shirazi and now Kabeer.
Hamza I cannot resign right now. Let the company be a little stable and then I'll resign. Okay?
No. You will resign right now.
Hamza try and understand. I cannot resign right now. The company will be in trouble.
Why do you worry so much for him?
Kabeer is my sister's husband and my sister is worried about her circumstances.
You know much damage Kabeer made me incur?
My company suffered a loss worth millions because of him. 
The medicine company I was working with, for the past six months,
that company canceled their contract with me and gave it to Kabeer and his friend.
This is your personal matter. Don't involve me. And don't force me to resign.
Where were you?
I went for some important work.
Tell me what important work you went for. I want to know.
I told you it was important. Why do I need to go into details for everything?
You're lying. You were on a shoot. I talked to Maria.
Kabeer whats wrong, how are you talking to me?
I told you not to model and yet you went there.
Kabeer I'm not modeling, I'm acting. There's a huge difference. 
As it is, I didn't want to do it but the opportunity was good.
I couldn't say no. There's no reason to say no. I'm getting fame and money, why should I say no?
Falak who will take care of Ilham?
The maid is there. She'll take care of her. 
As it is, I don't have to go everyday. Its just two days in a week. You can manage this, Kabeer.
You didn't even bother to tell me?
Nobody asks sister Aaliya. All restrictions are for me.
She doesn't like anybody questioning her. All this is for me.
Where did you bring in sister Aaliya in between all this?
Why won't I mention? We live in the same house and yet there are different rules for both of us. 
If I can't go anywhere, she won't either.
She should stay at home, why does she go to the office?
If you want to work, join a good workplace. I will not restrict you.
But I cannot allow you to model or become an actor. 
We have a family and we're conservative about it. Women in our family do not model or act.
Falak finish this drama and find a good job.
When you dislike my field so much, you don't feel bad when I travel in a cab.
How many times have I told you Kabeer that I need my own car?
How many times have I told you Falak, the situation isn't good.
I cannot get you a new car. You'll have to wait.
How much should I wait? The cab breaks down. I get late if I have to go somewhere.
Stop going out. Stay at home and take care of Ilham. 
Why do you have to go out unnecessarily?
I expect this from you. Don't do anything.
Will you have this a little? 
Sakina, ask Falak to come down for dinner.
Alright.
What nonsense is it? Why do I have to take care of her all day?
They restrict me for everything. 
My life is a living hell. Did I get married for this?
What is it with you now?
Mam, they're calling you for dinner?
I don't want to eat.
What?
Can't you hear me? Tell them I don't want to eat.
Yes mam.
Kabeer should know that I'm upset.
Have something to eat and then you can sleep.
Mam, mam Falak said she didn't want to eat.
Kabeer, go and call Falak. I think she's upset.
Let her be.
She'll eat if she angry. Nobody is going to call her now.
Please start, brother.
Whats wrong with you now? Be quiet.
Sakina? Sakina?!
Sakina?
Yes mam.
Take her. Take her to the other room and put her to sleep.
He's sleeping so peacefully. He doesn't bother whether his wife is alive or dead.
Falak? Falak look at her, she's crying.
You should look at her. She's your daughter too. Not mine alone.
Falak, what is wrong with you? I have to go to the office tomorrow and wake up early.
I go to work as well.
Falak, she's hungry.
Kabeer, attend to her yourself.
Alright, come. Come. dear. You're hungry.
No. No.. Come. Lets go.
Farooq sir, bring me the finance sheets of the last quarter. 
Okay, thank you.
Nawal?
Yes Aaliya, tell me.
These are the files with the details of all the suppliers of Kabeer Foods. Please check and let me know.
Sure.
And, this is the cheque. Get it deposited through any rider as soon as possible in Toqueer's account.
Sure thing.
Falak? You?
Is everything alright?
Yes everything is alright.
 I was free at home so I thought I'd come to the office and see whats going on.
Oh wow. The cheque is in Toqueer's name.
 You're sharing money here.
Do you know? I was telling Kabeer to have my car changed 
but he said the company's financial situation wasn't good.
But I should praise you sister Aaliya. 
You're stuck to this company like a parasite.
How are you talking Falak? Is this how you talk to your elders?
I'm right.
The company isn't in a good situation. We're going bankrupt. 
But something else is going on here. She's depositing such a big amount in her husband's account.
I'm telling you sister Nawal. This has been happening and has brought the company into financial crisis.
Falak, enough of your nonsense. 
You cannot blame anyone for anything so big.
You come with me.
I'm not accusing anyone, sister Nawal. 
It isn't. You're a big businesswoman.
We're suffering because of her. My life is a living hell. 
She plucked me from the heavens and threw me in hell.
She took away my apartment from me. My house. She has destroyed my life.
Aaliya please don't focus on what she says. Please leave. I'll handle her.
You make her understand. This company is running because of us. 
Had I not asked you, would you invest in this company?
If you invested in this company, I have a right on it as well. 
They've been putting me off for the past months. 5 months, 6 months..
The company goes bankrupt if I ask for money but you'll have money to transfer them to your husband's account?
Falak, I didn't invest for you but for Kabeer.
What do you mean?
I mean Kabeer needed an investment, his company needed it. That's why I invested.
So you didn't do it for your sister, what is our relation then? 
You didn't do it for me? You should be ashamed.
She cares for you people more than me.
Falak what are you saying? What has happened to you?
I'm absolutely right. What did you do that you turned my own sister against me?
 What did you say to poison her?
Falak, mind your language. This is my office. Don't create a scene here. Go home.
Whatever the problem is, discuss with Kabeer.
Why should I leave? This office is running on my sister's money.
Who are you to throw me out?
Falak I'm asking you to be quiet. You're misbehaving with Aaliya. Quiet!
Have you lost your mind?
Yes I've lost my mind. They've made me mad.
 I don't want to live with these illiterate people.
Aaliya, I'm so sorry. She must have something in her mind. Don't take it seriously. She's young.
I'm so sorry. Aaliya..
Aaliya, please stop crying. Please.
I don't understand what have I done to her?
I treated her like my younger sister. I don't know why she is so turned against me.
I'll make her understand. She'll apologize. Don't worry.
sister Aaliya.. What happened?
I'm asking you what happened? Tell me. Why are you crying?
 Nawal?
