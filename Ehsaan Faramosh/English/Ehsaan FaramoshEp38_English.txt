What is it Aaliya? Why is brother so angry?
Its nothing Kabeer. You go, I'll talk to you in a while.
No. We'll discuss everything right now.
Aaliya and I went to bring Falak back today?
What?
Why didn't you tell me before you went?
And Aaliya, even you didn't mention it.
We wanted to surprise you but..
But?
But what? Why are you both quiet?
See Kabeer. I'll not beat about the bush.
Aaliya and I went to bring Falak back.
But your in laws insulted us a lot just because of you.
What are you saying, brother?
Your wife has lost her mind.
Had you not allowed her to model, she wouldn't have become so bold and brazen.
Every time, she misused your soft nature.
Toqueer..
Whats wrong? Please stop.
How can I stop? He should know what his in laws think about us.
God knows what Falak told them. They feel we mistreat Falak in this house.
And Kabeer? Your in laws have a demand now.
Until you get a separate house, they'll not send Falak back.
They're mad. They've lost their minds.
Why didn't you people tell them that nobody mistreats her in this house?
We tried to make them understand but they were not ready to listen.
You should see Kabeer. Do as they say. Don't think about us.
What do you mean by this, brother?
Toqueer, they were angry. They're worried about their daughter.
They said what they thought was best for their daughter. Its not a big deal.
Kabeer will talk to them.
Once they listen to Kabeer, all their misunderstandings will be cleared.
What nonsense! What misunderstandings?
Everybody knows that Falak fed them everything. The confidence with which they talked,
did you feel there was a misunderstanding? Could there be a misunderstanding?
I'm telling you clearly, Kabeer. As much as we've been insulted today.
Falak is not coming back to this house, again.
Its best if you can live in a separate house with Falak.
What are you saying, brother? This can never be.
I will not leave you and Aaliya ever. I'll stay here.
And I will not let Falak destroy the peace of my house.
Enough is enough. She creates a spectacle every single day.
Had you controlled your wife since day one, things wouldn't reach this point.
Its better that you live separately rather than she create a spectacle everyday.
She creates a spectacle every single day.
Had you controlled your wife since day one, things wouldn't reach this points.
Its best if you live separately with Falak.
I married off my daughter in your family thinking that you're educated people and would take care of my daughter.
I never thought you'd mistreat my daughter like this.
One day both of you brothers will live separately.
This is what happens. So why not now?
At least you'll be able to meet your brother happily.
Toqueer what is wrong with you?
What do you mean whats wrong?
Aaliya I don't like it when someone points a finger at you.
Don't you understand what was happening there?
Who was Falak's family pointing out?
Who mistreats her in this house?
I understand.
But right now, rather than being angry, think with a cool mind.
It doesn't make a difference what Falak and her family wants.
What makes a difference is what Kabeer wants?
Enough Aaliya.
I've decided. I want my house's peace back at any cost.
And its only possible if Kabeer lives separately with Falak.
What?
Aaliya its best if you make yourself understand.
And as it is, what did Falak's mother's say?
After all how long will Kabeer and I live together?
We'll have to live separately someday.
Alright then, we'll live separately right away. Better sooner than later.
What did you say to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer?
Nothing. Nothing as such happened.
Falak, don't lie.
Didn't you tell them that you'll not come back until I get a separate house?
I asked for whats my right. Whats wrong in asking for whats my right?
Its wrong to insult them.
They're like my parents. How could you think I'd live separately?
Oh, so we sent them empty handed and they got insulted.
I knew how Aaliya would exaggerate everything when she went home.
But I didn't realize she'd feed you so much.
Falak!
Lower your volume Kabeer, its my house.
Is this your house? What did you tell your family here?
That you're mistreated in that house.
I didn't say anything. Mom talked to them on her own.
Alright then. Come back with me right now and apologize to sister Aaliya and brother Toqueer.
I'm sorry Kabeer but I'm not going anywhere.
And to apologize to them? Out of the question!
Think about it Falak!
I've already thought everything through. I'm talking after making my decision.
You told me to chose between my husband and career. So you think now.
Me, our child or brother Toqueer and sister Aaliya? Who will you choose?
What? Have you lost your mind Falak?
That's my family, like you're my family. There's no comparison between relationships and career.
Relationships are above career.
Enough Kabeer, don't speak with Aaliya's words.
What? What do you mean?
I know very well. Sister Aaliya had problems with me working. You never had a problem.
She keeps on feeding you and taunting you.
She cannot see me happy. I'm scared Kabeer that she'll harm my child and you'll not say a thing.
Falak!
Move away from my daughter.
How dare you hit her?
Did you people see with your own eyes? Will you trust me now?
Falak was right. You beat Falak up. Is this how you treat her?
You didn't hear what Falak said.
You did wrong. Look at her condition. It doesn't suit you to do this.
I hadn't realize.
I thought I had given my daughter to educated people but you're an educated illiterate.
Is this how you've been brought up? Don't you know you don't hit a woman?
I'll not send my daughter with you. Go away. Falak will not come with you.
Raheel's business is spread all over. Nazish won't be able to handle it. You'll have to be here to help.
You know very well, I cannot live here permanently.
I have my own business. I need to look over it as well.
Raheel's relatives are eyeing his business and money like vultures.
Two have threatened to go to court. Raheel's lawyers said,
we should try and have an out of court settlement or else the matter will go to court
Yes, I talked.
There's nothing to worry.
I will be worried my dear. Its my daughter's right.
If someone takes away my daughter's right, it won't be good.
They want a small share and its no problem.
They know very well they have no legal right on this property.
And if they go to court, we'll win the case.
Oh well, how's Nazish doing now? Is she okay?
She's better. She's resting.
Alright tell me when she wakes up. I need her signatures on a few papers.
Okay.
Brother, I wanted to talk to you
Tell me.
I want to apologize for whatever Falak's family said to you.
And please forget about living separately.
I cannot live without you and Aaliya. We're a family.
Where will I go from here? What will I do alone?
See Kabeer, I'm saying everything for you. Please try and understand.
Falak isn't happy here
and rather than creating scenes in the house everyday, wouldn't it be better we live separately?
Sultana is right. How long will we live together?
We will live off separately one day, so why not today?
Its no big deal and she isn't making a useless demand.
Don't make it a matter for you ego.
I'll not accept what you're saying.
I'll not leave you and Aaliya, no matter how much you tell me or force me.
Alright then, if you don't want to go, we'll go somewhere else.
What? What are you saying?
Someone has to go for the peace of this house. If not you, then us.
Brother, you people don't go anywhere. I'll go.
Thank God you received my call.
I've been calling you since so many days, you weren't answering. Is everything alright?
Yes. I had back to back meetings here.
I have everything running according to me in Pakistan. Here I have to work according to them.
Hamza you've been gone for so long.
Don't you have a plan to come to Pakistan?
Its difficult for now. But I'll try to come next month.
Nawal, I'm very tired. Can I rest and call you back?
Okay. Take care. Say hello to Nazish and aunty from me.
I will.
You take care.
Okay. Bye.
Was it Hamza's call?
When is he coming back?
Not yet. He'll take some time.
What fates we have!
Only worries.
Don't worry. Everything will be alright if God wills
If God wills.
I really liked Nawal. She is so sober and sensible.
A girl like Nawal will suit with him.
I don't like Nawal. I like Falak.
I requested them even after they said no. I told them to discuss and inform me.
My brother doesn't lack girls.
We'll find someone else.
I like Falak and I want to marry her. Its not a joke.
How will I just marry someone without liking her?
What are you doing? I brought food for you? Why did you throw the food?
I didn't expect this from an educated woman like you. She brought food for you with so much love.
This girl is a termite that knocks down a free from its roots.
Kabeer is worried.
I know.
Aaliya do one thing, give your flat in Clifton to her
so that he can bring Falak back.
He shouldn't destroy his life because of us.
You know basically Falak doesn't have a problem with this house.
She doesn't want to come back because she knows
she'll not get the freedom here that she wants.
Basically Falak wants to live her life on her own terms and she cannot do that while she's here.
But..
Kabeer will not be happy if he lives alone.
I know but it'll take some time and he'll settle down.
Kabeer?
Yes?
I had to give this to you.
What is this?
This is my apartment's file. Touqeer asked me to give it to you.
What is wrong with you people?
At least you make him understand. Why is he doing this to me?
He's doing this for your best. You have to worry for your unborn child.
Actually you don't know what rubbish she has in her brain.
And you know what? I've realized that,
marrying Falak was the biggest mistake of my life.
Don't say this Kabeer. Whats wrong with you?
Whatever Falak said to you. Forget it and start your life afresh.
Because you don't have to think about yourself and Falak only but your unborn child as well.
One wrong decision will destroy 3 lives. Understand what I'm saying.
Falak
Whats wrong? Why do you look so down?
Its nothing.
Its important for you to be happy these days. Please take care of yourself.
How can a woman, whose husband is upset with her, be happy?
Do you know, before I got married and after I got married, Kabeer would call me so many times in a day.
When I used to come see you guys,
he would always be with me on the phone. He'd ask me when I would be home. He'd say he was missing me.
And now see..
He has turned his face from me. As if I don't have any worth in his life.
Mom and I always want you to be happy.
But we're helpless in this matter.
That's why people say they're scared for their daughter's fate.
You know, had it been in my hand.
I would have taken away all your pains and worries.
You wouldn't have to worry about anything.
Trust me. I know. Aaliya must have told Kabeer to not contact me.
She must be turning him against me.
She must speak against me.
One day, two days, how many days? God is just. People suffer what they do for others.
God gives freedom to all these people. Nothing will happen to her.
Don't spoil your mood. The weather is very nice. Lets have lunch somewhere.
I am not in the mood.
Get up and come.
Please..
Come. Go and get ready. Come on.
Whatever Falak told you, forget everything and start a new life with her.
You don't have to think about Falak or yourself now. But your child as well.
Falak..
I want to talk to you. Alone.
I don't want to talk to you.
Falak. Talk. I'll wait.
Hurry up with whatever you have to say. I don't have much time.
I'm ready to get a separate house.
Really?
Hmm.
Yes but I think mom won't agree, she won't send me with you.
If you come home and apologize, maybe she'll think about it.
Falak I don't want to repeat the past.
And to be honest, I'm worried about my child.
I'm doing this for the baby that's why I'm ready to forget and start afresh.
What do you mean? You don't worry about me? You're doing everything for your child?
I could never think Kabeer that you'd change so much.
Those tall claims of love and promises, all of them were fake.
Let me know if you want to come back. I'll come pick you.
I was hurt with Kabeer's attitude yesterday.
To be honest, looking at him this way, I didn't want to send you with him.
What are you saying mom?
What should I say? This is how he treats you? He was about to hit you!
If he's doing this in front of us, what would he do behind us?
I cannot risk sending you with him.
Mom, Kabeer isn't like that. Aaliya turned him against me.
Kabeer would never talk loudly with me.
As it is, he is getting a separate house. We'll be rid of Aaliya.
It'll never happen again. He's embarrassed.
Alright dear.
I will not force you for anything.
Its your decision whether you want to go or not.
Falak, think about it once more. Its your life.
I cannot live here all my life. I have to go one day.
If Kabeer has realized, why should I embarrass him again and again.
And as it is, he's doing so much for me so can I not forget this thing for him?
alright then.
As you wish.
I've called Kabeer. He'll be here to pick me soon.
Alright.
Falak, if God forbid, if he says something wrong in the future that you cannot tolerate. Come back without worrying about anything at all. Understood?
Alright. Don't worry.
Hello? Yes Kabeer. I'm ready.
I'll be there in a minute. Come outside.
Will you not come inside?
No Falak. We'll be late. We have to get home. Just come outside.
Alright Kabeer. I'm coming.
You know we're directly going to our new house from here.
Kabeer, is this the apartment where we'll live?
Yes. Why? What happened?
Isn't it a little small?
Is it small?
Its not that big either.
I think you need to get your brain treated alongside your eyes.
Are you taunting me?
No. But if you want to compare this apartment with that house, yes, its small
but its enough for the two of us.
We need to get a lot of work done here.
What work?
The paint and interior. I want to live here so I'll do it as I like.
Whats wrong Falak? Everything is fine.
You think its fine. I don't like it.
ok
You can change what you don't like. We can do that once we're here.
Tell me when we're shifting.
Just go and pack and we'll shift.
Alright.
She couldn't even send someone for help or come herself.
 She must be jealous.
If you need some help, tell me.
No its done now. Had you wanted to help, you could have come earlier.
I just got back from work. Kabeer told me that you're here.
Of course. He insisted with so much love. How could I say no?
Its good. Dinner is ready. Lets eat together.
No. I'll now eat in my own house.
Will you not congratulate me?
Congratulations. Try and take care of yourself and Kabeer.
Don't worry. I'll take care of Kabeer so much that he'll not even think about you.
I pray that you're always happy.
I'll be happy but looking at you, it doesn't seem that you're happy.
Thank you very much for the prayers. 
Just pray that we live peacefully and happily in our house.
God will make everything better.
Hello. How are you?
I'm absolutely fine.
You know Kabeer and I have shifted to a new house. 
Yes. I was just setting up. Once everything is done. Do come. Yes everything is alright.
Where is he?
Hello.
Kabeer where were you? Its so late.
Why what happened?
What would happen? I'm dying of hunger.
Didn't you eat anything?
I ordered lunch but then I thought we'd have dinner outside. But you got so late.
So you could have cooked something.
What do you mean cook? I don't know all this.
You said you'd get a maid. Didn't she come?
I've asked for one. She'll come around in two three days.
Maid will come. What about the chef? When will he come? He'll be cooking.
See Falak..
Its just you and me here. You have to cook for two people. 
And until the maid comes, you'll have to do things around the house.
What is wrong with you Kabeer?
I cannot work in the kitchen. I get skin allergy.
You've never had this skin allergy earlier.
I didn't get it earlier, but now I do.
Try and cook. If you get skin allergy, we'll get a treatment.
Alright. Why are you angry? I'm so hungry. I'll faint. Lets go and have dinner.
I'm tired. Let me get freshened up.
You're absolutely fresh. Lets go. Come on, right now.
Do you need more flat breads?
No. Its enough.
You didn't eat well in the morning.
I don't feel like it.
Mom, has uncle really left?
Yes dear. He has a new home so he has gone to his new home.
Did he go because of you and dad?
Who told you this?
Falak aunty was talking to someone yesterday. I heard everything.
She said you and dad bothered her so much that's why they left and got a new house.
Actually, they didn't like this house anymore. 
They found a new beautiful house and they went there.
