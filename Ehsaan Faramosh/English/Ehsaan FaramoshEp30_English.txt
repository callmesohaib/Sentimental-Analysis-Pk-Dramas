Hello Sadaf.
Hello.
Where are you?
I'm home. Where will I be? You tell me, where are you? Whats up?
What will I tell you? I'm just fine. Tell me, did your friend find the model?
I don't have any idea.
I didn't talk to her about it. Is everything alright? Why are you asking?
I wanted to meet her. Is it possible?
Of course its possible.
By the way, why do you want to meet her? Are you thinking of becoming a model?
Not yet but who knows if I change my mind after meeting your friend.
Get me a meeting with her.
Why do I need to arrange a meeting? She's my friend and I can visit her office any time.
You tell me, if you're free right now, I'll come now.
Not right now. Lets plan for tomorrow. We'll meet tomorrow.
Alright, fine. Done.
Bye.
Sir, breakfast is ready.
No I'm not hungry. I'll leave.
Hamza, whats the rush? Have breakfast before you leave.
Mom, I'm getting late for an important meeting.
Just pray that I get the contract. If that is so, your son's name will shine in the business community.
As God wills, my prayers are always with you. Have something later.
Yes I'll have lunch.
Good luck.
Alright. Bye.
Well, its good to see all members here.
We received quotations from a number of companies.
Some quotations were so impressive that it become difficult for us to decide.
I want to take this opportunity to tell the CEO of Hamza Enterprises, Mr. Hamza that I'm impressed by your passion.
And I must say you're an example for our youth. Really, I mean it.
Thank you.
Now let me announce the result. The quotations that we have received, amongst them,
Hamza Group and Shirazi Group had quotations very close and our team has decided that we,
will like to work with Shirazi Group.
Thanks all of you.
Congratulations. You have finally received the contract.
Don't congratulate me. Congratulate Miss Nawal.
It is because of her that we received this contract.
Of course. Congratulations Miss Nawal.
Its because of your intelligence and hard work that he has received such a big contract
Thank you.
Hello Falak. What a surprise! I'm happy to see you.
Thanks.
Hi Anum. How are you?
I'm good. What about you?
Perfect. So how do you like my office?
Very nice. Its good.
Come, lets sit and talk. Sit down.
So what did you think?
By the way, seeing you here has given me an idea of your decision but still tell me.
I want to test my luck once.
Alright, now we're talking. So first of all we'll have a screen test with you. Ramsha.
Ask the makeup artist to be ready.
Okay mam.
Only lucky people get such a chance. One in a million. Fame and money, both together.
Are you looking at these girls? All of them are here for work.
But our Falak is very lucky in this regard. Isn't it Falak?
That's true.
Mam everything is ready.
Lets go. We'll have coffee later. Lets work first.
Alright.
Do I have to wear this dress?
Yes this is the demand of the show. Is there a problem?
This dress will boost your glamour. Try and wear it.
The changing room is on the other side.
Got a minute?
Yes please.
What are you looking at?
Survey report. The fire started because of a short circuit.
We need to focus on this so that this never happens again.
You're right. This incident has made us suffer a big loss.
All competitors have gathered together and they're spreading rumors.
I know. Just once. I need a big investor, just once. Everybody's mouth will be shut.
Thats why I'm here.
I talked to Mr. Omer Hayat's wife.
I hope she will get us a face to face meeting.
Once we talk face to face, all misunderstandings will be cleared.
I hope so.
Wait a second. Hello Mrs. Hayat.
I had complete faith that you'd get us the meeting. I understand. Thank you. Bye.
Mr. Hayat said no to the meeting.
Makes sense. This had to happen. Don't worry.
I'm trying to arrange money from somewhere else. Don't worry.
If only we found an investor who trusts us.
We will find one. Hope for the best. Don't worry.
Do you remember, we have an official lunch tomorrow from Mr. Sajjad?
Yes I remember.
I was initially thinking about talking to him but he isn't interested in the food business at all.
Wow. This dress suits you a lot. You look beautiful.
Javy, I need a new look for her. Absolutely fresh.
Come, mam.
We have achieved this after a long time. You have worked very hard for it.
Sir, honestly I wasn't expecting all this. Thank you so much.
Oh, we should be thankful to you.
No sir, this is my job.
Sir, didn't I tell you. No matter what happens, we'll get this contract.
Yes Hamza's face was a sight.
I was so happy to look at his face. I was at peace.
Like, I have fulfilled my wish after years.
Keep a look out sir, we'll get all contracts in the future as well.
As God wills.
Mom? Mom? Mom?
What is it Nawal?
Mom, I'm very happy today. Its because of you that I received a standing ovation today.
The entire office was standing. All staff.
Everybody clapped for me. I'm so happy, I cannot tell you.
But tell me what it is all about?
Mom, the contract I was working for, our company received that contract.
All praise to God.
Our company received such a big contract after a long time.
Its all because of my daughter's hard work. May God bless you with more success.
Do you know, my boss has promised me a promotion.
As God wills. Everything will be good then.
Its a very good idea. Put a few casual sarees in it so she can wear them casually.
Perfect.
Oh Hamza.. Listen..
What happened? Did you get the contract?
You must have. Congratulations. I know it. If you want something,
you get it all costs. Whatever he touches, turns to gold. Well done.
Were you saying something?
I brought some dresses for Nawal. You'll like them.
And you also have to tell me if she'll like them or not.
Its best if you ask Nawal about them. I cannot say anything.
Excuse me.
Mom.. what happened to him?
He must be tired. You also ask him so many questions. Lets finish this.
You never know his moods.
Wow. Beautiful. I wanted this look. This girl will set everything on fire. What do you say?
So should we ask her to sign one contract?
Whatever you say.
Send me all the pictures.
Maria? Hello?
Hie Falak. I'm sending you all the pictures.
The look is amazing. Wow.
Okay.
Falak? Falak, lets go. We're getting late.
Actually I was saying, we could go tomorrow. I feel very tired.
Not at all.
Aaliya has strictly instructed that I should take you out, take you shopping and take you dinner.
She was scolding me that I don't care of you and that you get bored at home.
That's why I'll take you out.
Lets go. Leave it. Check it later.
Yes. Give me my phone.
Take your bag. Lets go.
Give me my phone.
You'll get your phone.
The quotations that we have received, had Hamza Group's and Shirazi Group's quotations very close.
But our team has decided to work with Shirazi Group.
Don't congratulate me, congratulate Miss Nawal. Its her hard work that has gotten us the contract.
Congratulations Miss Nawal. Your dedication and hard work have won them a very big contract.
Starters or sea food?
Do you like it here?
Yes. I really like it.
But whats the use? You'll not bring me out every other day.
Even if I like it, I'll have to go back to the same house, same room. Same boredom.
Why can't I bring you here? Whats the big deal about it? We'll come whenever you say.
No. Had Aaliya not reminded you, you wouldn't have brought me here.
You're right.
Actually, whatever happened in the past few days, I've been very occupied with everything.
Falak, why don't you do something? Find yourself a good activity. You'll be busy and not get bored.
Think about it. Don't say no then.
Why would I say no then?
You can do whatever you want to do. Keep yourself busy but,
But what?
Just make sure, our child to come isn't harmed.
Even I know that much. I'm not that stupid.
Now we're talking. Tell me what do you want to eat.
Do whatever you want to do. Keep yourself busy Falak. Find a good activity for yourself.
Welcome. Welcome.
Hello. This is for you.
Thank you so much. So nice of you.
I thought you people might not come.
You invited, why wouldn't we come?
Obviously we had to come.
I'm so honored. Oh, excuse me.
Hello. Welcome. Welcome. How are you? Thank you. So nice of you.
You're very lucky that you're working with Mr. Hamdani. A lot of big companies wanted to work with him.
But all praise to the Lord, you won the deal. Anyways, meet them. This is Mrs. Aaliya.
Hello.
And this is Mr. Kabeer. Owner of Kabeer Foods and business partner.
Nice meeting you.
Same here. Who doesn't know them?
How are you Mr. Shirazi?
I'm absolutely fine. How are you?
I'm absolutely fine. Thank God.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry, I have to take this.
No problem.
Heard about the fire in the branch. It was very upsetting.
Yes, thank God, it wasn't a big incident and there were no causalities.
We get to hear a lot of things.
You suffered a loss worth millions and Omer Hayat canceled his business deal as well.
You know this happens in business.
Of course. This is how business works.
Some time ago, I thought about investing in the food business but then I canceled it.
We don't get time from the construction and real estate business.
There would be no one to look after our food business.
So, why don't you look into a partnership in food business. You could invest.
The other party could handle everything. It isn't that difficult.
Miss Aaliya, you cannot trust anyone in this age.
Thats true. Anyway, we'll keep talking but I want you to meet a few guests.
Miss Aaliya, please help yourself. Have something.
Alright. You go. I'll call you if I want to discuss anything.
Hello?
Where are you right now?
In the office. Where else would I be?
I want to talk to you.
Yes, tell me.
No. Face to face.
No. I'm very busy. I cannot come. Tell me on call.
No matter how busy you are,
you can take some time out. I'm waiting where we always meet.
I told you I was very busy. I had back to back meetings. I came only because of you.
What do you want to show me? Are you the only one busy?
Don't I have any work in the office?
I didn't mean that.
Whatever you meant. Would I need to get an appointment to see you, ever since you got the contract?
See, I wanted to talk to you about it. This happens in the business.
I know how important this contract was for you.
It was important.
That he got because of you.
Why didn't you tell me that you worked for Shirazi?
I told you I worked for a multinational company with a good package.
And as it is, I had to join any company after leaving your company and Shirazi..
Had you mentioned Shirazi I wouldn't have let you join. Ever.
He's my competitor. He never lets go of any chance to hurt me.
You should have asked me before joining him.
See, you're wrong.
You're mistaken.
I haven't seen or heard anything about you from Mr. Shirazi or anybody else. How can you say that?
I could never think you would be this stupid.
You're resigning today.
What?
What did you say?
We're getting married in a month.
You had to resign then. Do it now. What difference does it make?
As it is, I'll not allow you to work once we're married but if you want to work, you can join my office.
This is my career and I worked hard for it. You cannot force me to resign.
I worked hard for this and I will not let it go waste because of a misunderstanding.
You will spoil our relationship because of a third person.
You'll have to think about it.
Are you jealous of my success?
You don't like it because you didn't get that contract.
Are you mad? Will I be jealous of you?
How could you even think like that Nawal?
You think that only you were entitled to that contract Hamza.
Its not like that. Anybody could get that.
See my business is spread around the world and you're only working an ordinary job..
Then why are you forcing a girl with an ordinary job to resign.
You don't understand, Nawal. He is using you against me. Why don't you understand?
This isn't so.
I think you're mistaken and nothing else.
See,
you will resign from that office today. That's it. This is my final decision.
I'm sorry Hamza. I will not resign.
You came back early from the office. Is everything alright?
I felt a little down.
Is everything alright? Anything to worry about?
Alright, the wedding cards are here. Come with me, I'll show you.
You look at them. I'm going to my room. I'm tired.
Don't disturb me please.
Hamza, its good that you're here. I have to go see Nawal. You come with me.
I have a headache. Please go with the driver.
Nazish what happened?
Mom whether you accept it or not.
I think Hamza and Nawal have had an argument.
I have never seen him this rude, ever.
You should call Nawal and ask.
Yes.
I don't understand this boy. He's always so moody.
What happened?
Mom, her phone is off.
Alright. Forget it. Just leave it.
Hello.
Hello.
Did you call me?
Yes.
Yes Sultana called. She was worried for the wedding preparations,
She was asking if we could send Falak for a few days.
She was also calling me but I didn't answer because I was busy.
Alright. Its her sister's wedding, send her there for a few days. Whats the problem?
I have no issues with Falak going there.
I'm just scared that she'll be careless there. You know what the doctor said.
I remember very well but you're forgetting that Sultana is Falak's mother and she'll take care of her well.
Exactly.
Alright. I'll ask Falak to go in the day.
Yes. That's fine. If you think its good.
Kabeer, I was thinking one thing. I want to share it with you. I might go meet Mr. Shirazi in a day or two.
Mr. Shirazi? Is everything alright?
He's interested to invest in food business.
We need a big investment, maybe he can invest.
Alright as you find best.
Best of luck guys.
Hello sir.
Hello. Come sit.
How are you Ms. Nawal?
I'm fine sir.
Here.
Sir what is this?
Please take a look.
Sir, is this..
Yes this is your promotion letter. We promised you'd get a promotion if we got Mr. Hamdani's contract. Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you so much sir.
You're our senior manager now. You'll lead the entire department from today.
Sir, thank you so much. This means a lot to me.
Mr. Waqar please tell everyone to follow Ms. Nawal's orders from now on. Thank you.
I'm very happy to have such a hard working and dedicated girl as a part of our organization.
Sir,
This means a lot to me. Thank you so much.
You deserve it.
Give me your purse. Give it to me..
Stop..
Falak.. Falak, what happened?
Kabeer those boys took my bag. They went that way. Please see.
Are you okay? Did something happen to you?
They had a pistol. They said they'd shoot me.
Please I have everything in my bag, call the police.
That I will but what are you doing here right now?
I was here to meet my friend. Call the police, will you?
I will. Come now. Leave them.
Nawal what is it, what is bothering you, tell me.
You come home from work and shut yourself in your room. I don't understand how we'll manage everything.
Only a few days are left for the wedding and have we so many things to do. How many things should I do?
There's nothing to worry about.
Tell me how it will be done?
I'm all alone. How will I manage? I called Falak's in laws but even she didn't come.
I got a promotion.
What? All praise to the Lord. You're giving me such a big news like this.
May God give you a lot of success. May you always be happy and stay away from all evil eyes.
Mam, Mr. Hamza is here.
Alright. Make him sit. Nawal, give company to Hamza. I'll just come.
Think about it. Had they shot you, what would have happen.
Kabeer? Falak? Are you okay?
Why did you have to go all alone?
That's what I'm saying why did she go all alone?
I asked her to take the driver. Why did you go alone?
The driver wasn't available and I wanted to meet my friend so I went all alone.
Which friend of yours stay there? I don't think you have a friend there.
there is one, Kabir
Whats wrong with you? She's already worried and you're asking so many questions.
Thank God she's home. See,
You must be in a lot of trauma. I'm sure you must be shaken. You go to your room and rest.
How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine. Come inside.
No. I want to discuss something important. Its best if we do it here.
I don't want our families to be involved.
Speak. I'm listening.
What did you think?
About what.
About your resignation. What else?
Hamza I was promoted. I'm the Senior Manager. 
Sherazi gave me the letter and my package has been doubled.
And still you don't understand. Which company promotes so easily? 
I've been here for a little while but you've been working here since ages.
What do you want to say?
I'm telling you they're trapping you.
Come on Hamza, I'm not a kid who doesn't understand.
We're getting married in three weeks. Everybody knows that.
People laugh at me. Everybody knows my wife to be works for someone else. 
Do you know how awkward I feel when people say such things?
Your marriage, your life, your office, your career, your respect, where am I in all this? 
Everything is yours. Where am I in all this?
My life, my career, my choice, my respect. Do they have any value in your respect?
I thought you had changed but I was wrong. 
You only know how to exercise your will on others.
 And as far as my resignation is concerned, I'll not give any.
