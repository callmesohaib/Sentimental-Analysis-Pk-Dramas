Just forgive me, once.
Just once.
I flew on the skies of your love but I kept my flight in check. 
But now that I want to fly high, don't tie me down with your loyalty.
Fly as high as you want to.
When you come back, you'll find all ways to come back, closed.
Falak? You? At this time? 
Is everything alright? Are you okay? Sit down.
What happened?
Aunty threw me out of the house.
She threw you out? How could she throw you out?
You didn't ask Hamza to do such a cheap thing. Its not your fault.
But she feels I made Hamza do this. She thinks I'm the root cause of everything.
Even if she thinks so, she cannot say this. 
Falak, you should go and talk to Hamza.
Its all his fault and everybody is blaming you!
I don't understand why are they punishing you?
 They should blame the one who is responsible.
See, you have the right to ask Hamza why he did, what he did. 
At least once.
We're giving you a breaking news. The police has arrested business tycoon Hamza Hashim for the kidnap of Kabeer Foods Owner's, Kabeer Salahuddin's daughter.
Mom.. thank God you answered. I've been calling you since long. 
Your number was busy.
I was talking to the lawyer. The police has arrested Hamza.
Yes, mom. I saw in the news.
I don't believe how Hamza could do such a cheap thing.
Falak trapped him and made him do this. He could never do such a thing.
Yes, Falak must have made him do it. But Hamza isn't a child.
 Even if Falak asked him. He could say no.
Falak isn't the only one at fault. Even Hamza is responsible.
Mom, don't worry. I told you I'm coming.
We'll get him out.
He's my son. How could I not worry? 
You know what the lawyers said? They said the punishment is four years for this.
Mom, nothing will happen, I said. Let me come. We'll not let Hamza stay in for so long.
And where is Falak?
I threw her out.
You did good. She deserved it.
Alright mom, don't worry. Take care. I'll hang up now. Bye.
What did you do Hamza? Why did you do it?
I don't believe it. 
You were my pride..
You were my pride and today I have to see this day because of you.
Is this how you pay me back for all my love and upbringing?
Why Hamza? Where did I lack in your upbringing?
Why did you show me this day?
I brought you up as a mother and father both. 
I was so proud of you.
You were such a good boy. 
Handsome, intelligent, honest, loyal and hard working. And today..
this is what you showed me. You behind bars?
You have no idea, I cannot see my face to people. 
Let people alone..
I am questioning myself that where did I go wrong that I had to see this day.
I don't believe it. My life has become hell. I cannot sleep.
I don't know what will happen in the future? 
How will you clear your name? How will I be able to show my face to people?
Totally broken.
You have no idea that her son is everything for a mother.
I had so many expectations from you.
 I thought my son would take care of me.
He would support me but see.. See this.. This is what I've brought for you. Why?
I don't believe it. This isn't my Hamza. That girl made you do it. 
Didn't I tell you to leave her? 
Had you left her, this wouldn't have happened. I wouldn't have to see this.
That girl became so important to you that you didn't listen to your mother. 
Why didn't you listen to your mother, Hamza?
I should have listened to you.
I'm suffering because of that.
Sign these. The lawyer gave these. He'll try his best to get you out.
The proofs are against you. 
I have very little hopes that I can get you out,
but since I'm your mother. I'll try my best. I will.
Please forgive me.
 I know I made a lot of mistakes in life.
Please get me out of here. 
I cannot stay here. I feel suffocated. 
Please get me out.
Yes. Sure.
I'll take you by the collar. Tell me where is my daughter?
 I wanted to take her along for this reason. 
I knew you'd be busy pampering each other. 
how you would have cared for my daughter?
How did I leave a piece of my heart with you guys?
 I should have taken her along. Why did I leave her here? Where is my daughter?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about Falak.
She accused us for such a big thing. 
She didn't even realize it was Hamza's doing.
I don't think Hamza did it alone.
 I'm 100% sure that Falak was involved in all this.
Because as indifferent and selfish she is, I think she put all this in Hamza's brain.
It could be so. What can we say?
When a person has power, why do they forget who they are?
They claim to be God.
When Hamza had power, he thought he could do anything he want. But he forgot
 that you reap what you sow in this world. You have to suffer if you do wrong.
You're right. This world is a reaping ground for what we sow. 
The hole you dig for others, becomes your own grave.
Did you talk to the lawyer? Did he say something?
I did. He said the case is very strong. He could be sentenced for a minimum of six years.
You? Why did you come here? I hate you. Leave!
I hate you.
Let alone hate, I feel nauseated looking at you.
I thought whatever happened was Kabeer's doing, but it was you. 
You kidnapped my daughter and kept her in pain for so many days.
I did everything because of you. So that you could have her.
You're lying. It was nothing like that.
I wanted to bring my daughter to me but not like this. 
Not by hurting anyone.
Children are innocent like angels. How did you do this to my child?
 If you had told me once, I'd have never let you do it.
A mother can tolerate everything but she cannot see her children in pain.
Now you'll tell me all this? 
When you left your daughter crying, didn't you realize her pain then?
I was wrong. I was wrong but I've realized. Even if its late.
And you didn't do all this for me. You did this to satisfy your ego. 
You wanted to hurt Kabeer and Nawal and you used my daughter as a pawn.
You're an indifferent person!
Are you saying this?
 Why am I here today? Only because of you.
You're behind all this destruction. Only you!
God knows why I was trapped because of you.
 Its because of you, I lost the most valuable thing in my life.
I loved Nawal so much. 
I lost her because of you.
You're not worth having in my life.
That's why today, I set you free.
I'm divorcing you.
I'm divorcing you.
I'm divorcing you.
You're a cheap man. Very cheap. 
Thank God sister Nawal didn't come in your life or else you'd have destroyed her life like mine.
 A cheap man like you, didn't deserve a good girl like her.
You're a cheap man..
Falak, lets go from here.
Considering the proofs and the witnesses, the court has decided 
that both Hamza Hashim and Sher Khan are equally responsible for Ilham Kabeer's kidnap.
That's why both the criminals are sentenced to 6 years in prison.
 The court is adjourned.
Surprise..
Hamza.. Oh my God..
Hello. How's my baby?
Very good. Hamza?
Dear, all of a sudden? Nazish see who's here. Come fast.
Yes mom..
Hamza? What a pleasant surprise?
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Had I told you, would you have been so happy?
My son.. How will he spent so many years in prison? 
How will he suffer so much pain? I brought him up with so much love.
Oh God, have mercy. Save my child. How will I live without him?
She's very helpless, she'll not live here forever. Its only for a few days.
Not at all. I don't like her living here. Tell her to leave.
She has nowhere to go. Tell me where will she go?
She can go anywhere she wants to. I don't give a damn. Just tell her to leave. Please.
This is very wrong. She's my friend.
Please..
Falak.. when did you come?
Just a little while ago when you and Yasin were arguing.
Falak I'm very embarrassed. I tried to explain him but he doesn't listen.
Its alright.
You did enough for me
I'm so sorry Falak. If I could, I'd never have asked you to leave.
I can understand. You're my only friend. You've done a lot for me already.
But where will you go Falak?
I'll go to any girl's hostel. I just need a place to stay.
Alright. I'll give you some money. You'll need it.
Come in the balcony
Oh, you here?
Yes I wanted to see you so I came here.
So why are you standing there? Come inside.
No. I'll see you from here only.
Alright. You stay there. I'll come.
If you have emotional memories with this house, you can keep it. 
As it is, once my movie is released I'll not live in this coup. I'll get another house. Bigger house.
A mother's love in unmatched. If you try to find it, you never will.
A human being loses everything because of his haste. 
He earns a loss rather than benefits. 
He loses what he won.
That's why my dear, you should be patient.
Forgive me, mom. I made a big mistake. Forgive me..
If only I hadn't given this house to Nawal in exchange for the plot.
 I would have had this house as a shelter.
Come on..
Listen girls, you'll have to share your room with her. 
And listen to me, pay me the rent before the 5th of every month or else I'll fine you.
Is this how the fan works?
Yes this is how it works? Do you want me to get an A.C for you?
Falak..
You?
You shouldn't have come here.
I know I shouldn't have come here
 but everything is finished sister Nawal..
Hamza has divorced me.
Didn't you tell me that relationships based on bad intentions and lies aren't strong?
They break soon.
Our relationship was like that. Based on lies. 
Without a foundation. A opportunist like me stays empty handed.
I kept running behind money and wealth and left all my relations.
 I forgot that this was a deal in loss.
I hurt you very much. I treated you very badly. Please forgive me.
Falak I have nothing in my heart against you. I have no complaints with you.
These are the custody papers for Ilham. I'm giving you her custody.
I don't want her to be like me. 
I treated everyone badly but I don't want to do my daughter anything wrong.
I want her to be like you. 
Someone who loves everyone and takes care of them.
You loved an ungrateful, step sister like me. 
You forgave everything I did wrong. I want her to be like you.
I wronged you. 
If you can, please forgive me. 
Ask Kabeer to forgive me as well.
Take care of my daughter.
 Please make her like you.
