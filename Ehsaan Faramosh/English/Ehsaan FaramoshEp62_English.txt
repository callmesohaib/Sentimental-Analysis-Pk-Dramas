Who are you?
Isn't she the same daughter whom you left crying with your ex-husband for money?
You never turned and asked about her.
I have no attachment with the child. She isn't mine but Kabeer's daughter.
If you don't hold back from your antics, I might change my mind and withdraw the case.
Wow.. Very nice..
Uncle, give me Ilham so that I can play with her.
No.. She'll fall down. She's very young.
Oh.. when did you come? Now happy.. Your dad is here..
I cannot forget the sight when she was admitted in the hospital.
Her small hands were being injected with drips.
I couldn't help but do something and take all her pain.
If only..
Falak realized the same thing. It would have been so good then.
I had such important meetings. You didn't come to the office once.
If only for a little while, you could have come to the office.
Until my daughter is found, I cannot do anything.
Please look into the meetings and ask the manager if there's a problem.
Kabeer I can understand your condition
but if you don't concentrate on your business, how will it work?
Qaiser my daughter has been kidnapped. Its not a joke.
And until we can find Ilham, I cannot even think about coming to the office.
Please pray,
wherever Ilham is. She's fine and that I can find her soon.
I'll come to the office after that.
As God wills. I'll leave now. Take care.
I'm going out for some work. I'll be back in a while. Cook something.
Alright.
Oh my God, she's burning up. What should I do?
Sher Khan? Sher Khan.. Sher Khan..
How long is the child sick for?
Its been three days.
Its been three days and you're bringing her right now?
Actually doctor, my husband had told me not to, that's why I couldn't bring her
.
Your husband said no?
What is the child's name?
Name? I don't know her name.
What do you mean? Isn't she is your child?
No. She isn't my daughter.
This is my husband's friend's daughter.
She is at our house for a few days because her father is out of town.
What do you mean? She's your husband's friend's daughter and you don't know her name?
See the child is critical. She is dehydrated. We'll have to admit her.
Admit?
No doctor. I cannot admit her. If my husband comes, he'll hit me.
Please give me medicines, I'll give her when I get home.
Alright. I'll prescribe the medicine. Give her when you get home.
Yes.
Stay with her.

What? What do you mean? She's my daughter. I'm going inside.
Nawal....
Mr. Kabeer?
Who are those people? Whats the gang?
Mr. Kabeer, she's a woman. Gulmina. She didn't tell anything yet.
But she's saying she didn't kidnap her and she'll tell everything truthfully.
Please keep her at the station. Don't let her go.
I believe she isn't alone. She has more people with her. Its a gang.
They didn't even pity a little. My daughter is sick inside.
Mr. Kabeer
This is Dr. Nuzhat. She called and informed.
Thank you doctor. You've indebted me forever. Our daughter is our happiness.
Think of it as that you've returned our happiness back. I'll always be indebted to you.
No please. This was my duty. And,
We will keep your daughter here tonight because she's weak.
Alright. Thank you so much.
Mr. Kabeer don't worry. I have two policeman posted here.
They'll be here all night in civil dress.
Alright.
thank you!
Take care.
What happened? Why are you so worried?
No. I'm not anxious. Are you mad?
Whose this child?
She's my friend's daughter. His wife is dead so he's all alone.
He has gone out of town for a few days so he asked us to take care of her for a few days.
Where are you Khawar? I've been calling you since long.
Gulmina went somewhere with the child.
I don't know where she went.
If boss finds out he'll kill me.
Please do something. Ask someone.
Alright. I'm waiting. Tell me fast.
Yes sir? How are you?
I'm fine. Where are you? In the hospital or the police station?
I'm at my house. Why would I be at the hospital or the police station?
What? Don't you know yet?
What do I not know?
Kabeer's daughter has been found.
What?
When? Who told you?
She was found a little while ago.
She's in the hospital right now. I heard the news on a news channel.
The social media is flooded with news. I thought I'd talk to you.
Listen, you should be in the hospital.
Take Ms. Falak and get to the hospital fast and ask Ms. Falak to spend the night at the hospital with the child.
These small things will help the case.
Alright. I'll call you later.
Hamza? What happened? Are you alright?
What?
Yes I'm fine.
You don't seem fine. Did something happen?
The manager called. He said we have to go to Dubai.
When?
Maybe tonight. You'll come with me. We'll go to Canada from there.
Hamza.. How can I go with you?
We don't know anything about Ilham. Her custody case is going on. How can we go?
Its important to go, that's why I'm asking you.
And as far as the case is concerned, I'll talk to the lawyer, he'll handle it.
Hamza please, can this tour not be postponed. We'll find Ilham until then.
When I have her, we'll go together. The case is going on, you know..
And I don't trust those people at all. I cannot leave my daughter with them.
Do as you're told. I don't have time to explain everything.
Why did you kidnap the child?
Sir I didn't kidnap the child. I can swear.
I just took the girl to the hospital for a checkup.
Don't force me to force you.
If you didn't kidnap the child, who did? Who brought her to you?
She's my husband's friend's daughter. He brought her to me.
Her father is out of town for a few days.
Do you think I'm a fool? I know women like you very well. Tell me everything clearly.
Nothing will happen then.
How many times should I tell you? I told you the truth. I'm not lying.
The bike that kidnapped the child, it came to your neighborhood.
We've seen everything on the CCTV. And the guy who kidnapped her,
This means that you have a full gang. Tell me everybody's name.
I'll take your name out of the list. I promise you'll not be punished.
Sir how many times should I tell you, I have no gang. You must be mistaken.
She will not speak like this.
Torture her.
Sir, I'm not at fault. Please let me go home.
Please come home with me and ask my husband. You'll find yourself that I'm telling the truth.
Alright. Take her address.
And give your husband's mobile number
I don't remember the mobile number. I forgot the phone at home. Please come with me.
You can ask my husband, Sher Khan yourself.
What did she tell?
Nothing. She said she's alone and she has no support.
She said she didn't kidnap the child.
She says its her husband's friend's daughter who has gone out of town.
She's lying. Completely.
Please don't trust her. Do whatever it takes but make her tell me. Don't leave her like this.
Don't worry. We know what we have to do. Rest assured.
I need tickets for Dubai.
What? The flights are full.
Do whatever it takes, I need the first available flight in the morning. Any airline.
Okay. I'm waiting.
Hamza, dear, are you going somewhere?
Yes. I'm going to Dubai.
All of a sudden? Is everything alright.
I had an important meeting. I thought I'd take Falak along and then we'll go to Canada to see Nazish from there.
So..
Excuse me? I have a call. Hello?
Strange..
How long is the trip for?
Its not confirmed but it might take 10-15 days. Depends upon the meetings. Maybe more.
By the way, when are you coming to Canada?
I have no plans yet. I'll tell you if I have a plan.
Alright. Falak? Its time for the flight. Come.
Sir, the police is outside. They're asking for you.
Alright, go. Call them.
Alright.
Why is the police here again?
Inspector you?
Hello.
Hello.
The child has been found.
Are you telling the truth? Is my daughter found? How is she?
She's absolutely fine and she's with her father.
We couldn't contact you so I had to come to tell you.
Thank you inspector. Thank you very much. Thank God you heard me. My daughter is found.
Did you find out who kidnapped her?
No. We couldn't find who kidnapped her. But we're investigation. 
Alright, I'll take your leave.
Yes, thank you.
Hello? 
What? Is the flight canceled?
But why? I didn't get any cancellation message.
Alright. Fine. Okay.
What happened?
The flight to Dubai has been canceled.
Strange. It has never happened.
Yes. I don't know whats the reason.
Come. Come..
Oh baby.. 
You? What are you doing here?
I'm here to take my daughter.
What happened my dear? Did you miss mom? Its alright. Mom is here. You'll stay with mom now.
What do you mean she'll stay with you now?
After the incident, do you still think you'll keep her? You've lost the right.
No. You cannot take her. See how she's crying.
Step back!
You don't have the right to keep her. 
Kabir... Kabir!
Its because of you she was in hell. Look how weak she's become..
Are you mad? Give her to me!
Leave me!
Give her to me! Give her!
She's my daughter. I have a right on her. Not the two of you
What right are you talking about?
What right are you talking about Falak? You let go of all your rights willingly.
Nobody forced you. Have you lost your memory?
I made a mistake but I'll resolve it now. I'll take my daughter along.
After what you did, after the incident, its proven that you cannot take care of her. 
I'm taking my daughter along. I'll care for her, myself.
I'm warning you.
I'm warning you Falak.
 You cannot take her along unless the court decides. Say whatever you want to say in the court.
Alright. We'll meet in the court. But you also understand this.
The court will decide in my favor.  
It will never take a child away from her mother. They'll never decide in favor of a step mother 
who cannot take care of her.
Are you done with whatever you had to say? 
Leave quietly and don't come back again.
You're doing wrong.
Get lost.
I'll see all of you!
What? What are you saying? Sher Khan's wife has been caught? But how?
And Sher Khan let her go? 
Listen to me. Make him go underground right now or send him out of town.
His wife can go to hell. You're worried about his wife 
and what about the police hovering on my head because of you?
Do as I say. Right now. Hide him anywhere. 
Make him go underground. Do anything it takes.
Do you know what will happen if he's caught? 
He shouldn't be caught by the police by any means!
Okay.
What happened Hamza? 
Who shouldn't be caught by the police? Who were you talking to?
