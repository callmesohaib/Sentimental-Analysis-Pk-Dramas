Then?
Yes finalize the meetings. I've seen the schedule. Alright.
Okay. Done.
Are you going somewhere, Hamza?
Yes I have an official tour of Europe.
I have a meeting with a few companies.
Alright then, I'll come with you.
But what will you do there?
So what will I do here?
You know how your mother and sister treat me.
If you aren't here, they'll taunt me even more.
As it is, they don't like me living here. Its better I come with you.
But I'll be busy in the meetings there.
You'll not be busy the entire day. Meetings don't take all day.
When we get time, we'll go out, do shopping and spend time with one another.
As it is, we didn't even go for our honeymoon.
We have this excuse. Lets go. Whats the harm?
See Falak, I'm not going alone.
I'll have my whole team and sometimes the meetings take whole day.
Once I'm free from there, we'll plan our honeymoon.
Do you know how much I want to? I want to go out,
I'm tired of being at home. I get bored at home.
So go out. Whose stopping you? Hang out with your friends. In fact I'll do one thing.
I'll get you a club membership. You'll get a good gathering. Enjoy there
I don't want a club membership Hamza. I want to go with you.
Please take me along.
Falak, try and understand if I say something. Don't be stubborn without a reason.
Yes. Whatever I say is rejected. I don't have any value in your life.
You finalize the deal with Mr. Yasir and tell me. I think he's a good man.
Yes. Everything is okay from my side. Have you checked to your satisfaction?
I have no objections then. See you in the office, tomorrow. Okay.
Sister Aaliya..
How come you're here all of a sudden?
You tell me, how are you?
I'm fine but you came all of a sudden. You didn't even tell me.
You should have informed me, I would have come pick you at the airport.
How would this have been a surprise then?
I told Toqueer to not tell you anything.
But what a pleasant surprise! I'm so happy. I don't believe it.
Had I told you, how would I see this happiness on your face.
Hello mam.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you? How is sir?
I'm very well and they're both good too.
Alright, now take this bag to sister Aaliya's room and get her room cleaned fast.
Alright.
Where is Ilham?
She just slept a little while ago. She isn't well.
Why? What happened to her?
She has fever.
Did you get her checked from a doctor?
Yes, I did. The doctor said she'd be fine.
Her nanny.. Where is Noor?
Noor has resigned.
Her husband found a government job in Hyderabad so she shifted with him.
Should I go see her?
Why do you have to be upset about it? Its just for a week.
And how will I spend this whole week?
I've been telling you since long.
You know how difficult it is to live with auntie and your sister. They taunt me.
I'm scared Hamza.
What if I answer them back? What will happen then? Please try and understand.
Alright. Give me your passport.
Thank you Hamza.
Now fix your mood.
All praise to God, she's so happy because you're here. It seems she wasn't even sick.
She had high fever.
I'm here but I'm not here forever.
If I'm not around who'll take care of her?
I talked. We'll arrange a nanny in a day or two. Don't worry.
And if she leaves as well?
What about that?
Why will she leave?
What are you saying?
Why would a girl take up a permanent job here?
They will leave someday or the other. Sometimes people are helpless.
That's why I kept telling you.
Let me take Ilham with me. I'll take care of her, well.
Toqueer told me to get her passport. He said he'd talk to you.
She'll stay with us happily, there..
sister Aaliya..
We have already discussed this topic.
You know very well I won't send Ilham with you. Think about it yourself.
If Ilham goes with you, what will I do here, all alone?
How can I leave her alone?
God forbid if you have to travel out of city, then?
What will you do then?
I'll manage. I'm managing right now as well.
There's another solution
And what is that?
Kabeer you should get married again.
What are you saying? I mean, how could you even think about it?
I will not get married again. Not at all.
Why? Whats the harm?
If not today then tomorrow, you'll have to get married. Then why not now?
It will be good for Ilham. Whoever becomes your wife, will also take care of Ilham?
What guarantee do you have that the girl who comes here,
she will take care of Ilham when Ilham's own mother didn't care for her.
And I've heard a lot of stories about step mothers.
I'll not take any such risk, please.
So will you stay here like this always? Alone?
Kabeer look at yourself. You and this house,
need someone who can give you company and take care of you.
Aaliya, no matter what happens, I'll not get married again and this is my final decision.
Grandma, will you take me to funland?
Of course I will.
I want ice cream as well. Please grandma. Mom doesn't let me eat ice cream.
Bad mom.. but you know she's right. You eat ice cream and get a sore throat.
Come on, lets go. We're late. Come.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you people going somewhere?
Yes I'm taking Nazish and Naveen for dinner. Come with us.
No. Actually Falak and I just had dinner.
Alright.
I wanted to discuss something with you. I'm busy throughout the day, I don't get time.
Tell me what it is.
Falak and I are going to Europe for a week on our honeymoon.
Are you asking me or telling me?
I'm telling you. Actually its a business trip so I thought I'd take her.
She'll have an outing and we'll have our honeymoon as well.
Dear, we're getting late. If not ice cream, we can have chocolates. Come on. Lets go.
Hamza, mom wouldn't have told you no
but it would have been good had you asked her before you planned.
She would be proud.
sister Aaliya, is Ilham asleep?
I couldn't even make her stop crying or get her to eat anything
but once she looked at her aunt, she was all settled and ate too.
All praise to the Lord.
You people should have told me yesterday, I would have come immediately.
Kabeer did you call Nawal?
No. I called myself. I wanted to ask about Ilham. He told me so I came immediately.
She's very much attached to you. She got better when she looked at you.
I was thinking that unless you have a nanny arranged, I could take Ilham with me.
Nawal how will you care for her? You'll be bothered...
I'll not be bothered.
Aaliya you saw how attached she is. I'll handle everything easily. You're busy in work,
If this hadn't been, I wouldn't have asked.
Kabeer, Nawal is alright.
Nawal is so attached with her. She'll feel better if she's happy. Let her take her.
Alright. As you find better. I'll get her things packed.
Perfect.
Mom, its time for our flight. We're leaving.
Take care.
Yes.
Bye auntie.
Its okay.
Bye. Bye.
Kabeer, I am thinking something.
Yes. I can see. You're thinking very deep.
What are you thinking?
I mentioned it to Toqueer as well. He supported me as well.
But what is it?
Kabeer..
You just don't want to remarry because the girl who'd come, she,
might not accept Ilham or might not take good care of her.
Yes. This is it.
What I'm about to say, listen to it with a cool mind and then answer me.
If, you marry Nawal, then..
What? What are you saying?
Why are you reacting this way? I didn't say anything wrong.
Nawal is a very nice girl. She's mature and very sensible and,
if you marry her, you won't even have to worry.
She loves Ilham so much, she'll take care of her, more than anything.
But this isn't possible.
Why? Whats the harm in it?
Ilham needs a mother's love
and no matter how much you care for her, you cannot be her mother.
Not for your own sake, you'll have to marry Nawal for Ilham's sake. Don't you see,
Nawal is attached to Ilham. Who would care for more than her?
But I've never thought about Nawal like that.
See Kabeer, I'll not listen to you.
You'll have to decide. Don't you like Nawal?
No.
Nawal is a very nice girl. She can be the ideal for any guy.
So whats the problem?
See if you have anything in your heart, tell me clearly.
Even Toqueer has no objections.
To tell you the truth, I don't think I'm worthy of Nawal.
She deserves a better life partner than me.
Why don't we let Nawal decide this for herself?
Let me talk to Nawal. We'll accept whatever decision she takes.
If not for your own, you'll have to marry Nawal for Ilham's sake.
Don't you see how Nawal is attached to Ilham.
Who could care for her, more than Nawal?
Ilham isn't only my daughter, she's his daughter as well. He is her father.
And I want him to take Nawal. I left her there.
He sent her back immediately because mom and Nawal said so. You want independence and only my life to be destroyed.
No. You're wrong Falak.
You knew she's sick. You shouldn't have left her alone. If he's saying something to you now, listen to it quietly.
I'm.. very upset at what Hamza did with you.
I'm very upset about it.
When Kabeer told me, I was shocked. And I'm sure,
this is all Falak's doing.
Falak did everything to get Hamza's money.
Oh well, whatever is done, was bad for you.
But I'm very happy that you gathered yourself very quickly.
Actually Kabeer helped me a lot. He encouraged me alot.
Do you know like you try to care for everyone,
similarly, Kabeer also takes care of his family and friends, very much.
He always tries to help and support as much as he can.
There's no doubt about that.
Had Kabeer not been around,
I wouldn't have been able to get out of that phase.
Nawal, I am here only for a little while.
Basically I had to get a few of Hafsa's documents updated and,
Toqueer asked me to get Ilham's passport and bring her along.
You.. will you take Ilham along?
I wanted to but,
Kabeer isn't agreeing. He said he'll be alone.
If you take her along, how will he feel settled here?
Toqueer and I are worried for Kabeer.
He is taking care of the business all alone and he has Ilham's responsibility on him as well.
I suggested him to get married again.
But he doesn't agree. He says who knows how that girl would be.
Whether she'll take care of Ilham or not. He's just stuck over it.
I tried to explain him that if the girl is good, she will take care of Ilham.
Most definitely. Please look in your social circle, I'm sure, you'll find a nice girl.
Nawal.. I want.. you to marry Kabeer..
Sorry.. What are you saying, Aaliya?
Nawal you will get married, somewhere. Why not Kabeer?
Kabeer is very nice. No doubt. But..
This way? All of a sudden. I don't know how to answer you.
I understand. Its very confusing.
See, if, Sultana aunty had been alive, I would have talked to her.
She's not around so I'm forced to talk to you.
You should think about it and answer me. Take your time.
I know this is a difficult decision for you.
But, remember this that I know, Kabeer will keep you very happy.
What did the two of you think? I'd never find out whats going on between you two!
Mind yourself Hamza!
Why should I mind myself?
You're a cheap man. Weren't you a little bit ashamed?
You're having an affair with your ex-wife's sister.
I want you to marry Kabeer..
Nawal?
What is it? Ever since Aaliya left, you've been quiet.
No. I'm not worried. You're just being doubtful.
Am I? Then why are you sitting here all alone and thinking?
Don't try and put me off. Tell me what did Aaliya say.
Aaliya brought a proposal for me from Kabeer..
What?
She said he will get married again. 
And rather than marrying someone who cannot care for Ilham, its better,
that I should marry him.
What did you answer?
I didn't say anything.
 I cannot marry Kabeer, auntie. You know Hamza accused me.
If I marry Kabeer, all those accusations prove to be right. 
People will feel that whatever he said was right. 
I can tolerate everything except people pointing their fingers at my character.
I will not marry Kabeer.
Kabeer is a very nice guy. He's sensible, sober.
Falak mistreated him and his family and yet I never heard Kabeer badmouth her.
Falak accused him terribly in her press conference. 
Kabeer could have had a press conference in return and answered her accusations.
But he didn't do that. Do you know why? 
Because he respects Falak. He knows how to respect women.
And you told me yourself 
that he took care of you when you were sick. 
He took you to the hospital and stayed there.
Nawal, the hands that support you when you're falling apart,
they're priceless. Don't let go of them.
Mom, what happened to you? Why are you sitting like this?
I just felt a little sick so I came here.
You felt sick? Did you take your medicine?
Yes. Its nothing. My heart just felt heavy.
Mom, what are you thinking? Whats bothering you?
Hamza..
I'm worried about Hamza. 
He has gone for several days and he hasn't even called me once.
It has never been the case.
Mom, he must be busy that's why he didn't call. He always calls you otherwise.
Don't worry about it.
How can I not worry about it dear? He's my only son and he has changed. 
God knows what that girl is feeding him. I don't understand,
Why can't he see all that you and I can see about her?
Mom, everything has a time and perhaps its not time for Hamza's eyes to be open yet.
But you'll see, the day his eyes open, he'll not even take a minute to throw Falak out of his life.
I made a big mistake.
I shouldn't have postponed Hamza and Nawal's wedding. 
Had they been married, I wouldn't have had to see this day.
Mom, its all fate. Maybe Nawal and Hamza weren't meant to be together.
But you see, don't worry like that.
 If you think about it, you'll not get anything except worries.
See, its very late at night. Go to your room and rest. Staying up late isn't good for you.
Nazish listen to me carefully. 
Take over Raheel's business and bring it under your control. It needs to be done.
Business in my control? But why? Why are you saying this? 
Whats going on in your mind?
I have a fear in my heart.
The way this girl convinced Hamza to get married, 
what if she convinces him to take over your business?
I don't know what she's planning. I'm worried for you and Naveen. Please,
take over your business and take control of it. I beg you.
Mom, you're over thinking. Hamza isn't like that.
He isn't a fool. He'll never do that.
Right now he's the world's biggest fool.
Look at what he's doing. He has forgotten us. He doesn't even bother.
Alright mom, stop worrying. 
Its very late and its not good for your health to be up so late.
Nawal is a very nice girl. She's sensible and mature.
 If you marry her, you won't be worried.
 She loves Ilham so much, she'll care for her more than her own life.
I told him to get married again. He doesn't agree. 
He says he doesn't know how that girl would be and whether she'd care for Ilham. He's stuck over it.
Hello Nawal, how are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine. Can we talk, are you busy?
Kabeer, you don't have to be so formal with me.
Nawal, don't think I'm using Ilham as a shield to make you emotional and marry you.
Its not like that.
See Nawal, you don't have any pressure about it. Nobody is forcing you.
Kabeer you're a nice guy.
If I say I cannot marry you, will you not mind it?
No. What are you saying? Whats there to mind about it?
I'm embarrassed. You're a very nice man.
Nawal you don't have to justify. 
Its your right to say no. I told you nobody will force you.
In fact, to tell you the truth, I'm very embarrassed. 
I told sister Aaliya not to go there.
And had she wanted to see you, she shouldn't say such a thing.
Kabeer, you,
know when Hamza accused me of being involved with you, I couldn't sleep for many nights.
I was hurt with what he said. 
If I marry you,
Hamza's accusation will prove to be correct. People will feel we have something going on.
People will start questioning. How many people will I answer? 
You know the hardest thing for someone to do is to protect their character?
You're telling the truth but people don't believe you.
You're right. This does happen.
But oh well, don't worry. I had an idea what your answer would be.
Kabeer.. Aaliya said she'll call.
No. I'll talk to her myself.
Don't worry. She'll not call you and bother you.
Thank you, Kabeer.
Yes?
Sir, Ms. Nawal asked me to give this file to you.
Where is Ms. Nawal herself? Didn't I tell you to ask her to bring the file herself?
Sir I told her but she said she's busy.
Alright, you can leave.
Alright, sir.
Hello?
Can we talk?
If you're not busy.
Come in.
Nawal, why are you avoiding me?
I thought you'd be upset and it would be best if I don't face you for a few days.
Nawal, I'm not upset with you at all. I've told you this earlier as well.
And you have all the right to decide for your life, for yourself. 
I have no objections, Nawal. You know what,
I don't want to get married, again, myself.
I was quiet because sister Aaliya forced me to. 
I respect your decision Nawal. You don't have to worry about it now.
Just relax.
Yes, one more thing, I want you to overlook our medicine project as well.
I'm sending the file. If you need any information, you can ask Qaiser.
In fact, I'll do one thing. 
I'll arrange a meeting with you, myself and Qaiser. You can ask any questions needed.
We'll have a in detail discussion. What do you think?
Okay.
Good.
Kabeer will you have tea, should I make it?
No. I just had it a while ago.
Actually I wanted to talk to you.
Tell me. Is everything alright? All well in the office?
Yes, everything fine in the office. 
Actually, I don't want to get married again.
