I'm so sorry. Did you get hurt? Are you okay?
You broke my foot.
I think its fractured.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know when you came here. I was reversing the car.
Please come, I'll take you to the hospital.
There's no need. I'll go myself.
See, you're in a lot of pain. It doesn't look good. I'll remain guilty. Please come, I'll take you.
Please. Please come.
Be careful. Mind your foot.
Its hurting a lot. This had to happen today. How will I attend the wedding tomorrow?
I'm giving you this painkiller injection. You'll be at ease.
I'll not get this injection. I want to go home. I'm scared of all this.
Its just a painkiller. Get it. Its for your own good.
No. I don't want it. I've never gotten an injection. I'm scared of the needle.
Please look here. You don't have to look there.
Look at me.
No. No. I'll go back home.
Look at me.
No. I don't want this.
Please talk to me.
You tell me, I was going in my car. How did you come in front of it?
Did I come in front of your car?
Its all your fault. You brought you car there..
I didn't know when you came in front of it, just like you didn't know when you got the injection. Its done.
How do you feel now?
Its a lot better.
There is an ice cream parlor nearby. You'll feel good if you have ice cream. I feel that.
No. Thank you. Please just drop me home.
If mom finds out I had an accident, mom will be upset.
As it is, I'm getting into a lot of accidents these days.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Just drop me home. Turn right from  here.
Okay.
This.. this is my card.
Inform me about your well being.
I'm fine. I don't think I need this now.
You don't need anything but you can make one.
What do you mean?
I mean, I care for you. You're in a lot of pain
and after all this happened because of me so its my duty to know about your well being.
Fine.
Do inform me. I'll wait for you.
You tell me, I was going in my car. I didn't realize when you came in front.
Just like you didn't know about this injection. Its done.
This is my card. Inform me about your well being.
You're in a lot of pain and after all this is because of me so its my duty to ask about your well being.
Do inform me. I'll wait.
Should I message or not? No. Not today. It will look weird.
Hmm.. Brother? Who are you thinking about?
Nothing brother. Just like that.
Really? So tell me, how is the response of the new branch?
The response was good. In fact very good.
Do you know, our manager was telling me that all tables have been reserved for until next week
Oh wow. Amazing. Congratulations.
Thank you so much. But you need to congratulate your wife as well because without her it would have been impossible.
You know brother, there are so many new investors who want to invest with us and I'm hopeful that we'll open a new branch very soon.
As God wills.
As God wills.
So Touqeer, did you talk to the event planner?
Mam I have talked to the planner and don't worry. I'll handle everything.
So, we have Farheen's daughter's wedding function tomorrow. Please come home early, you both.
Both of you have to go with you. She asks about the two of you always and I have to make an excuse.
Now its not a small event but a close wedding. No excuses.
Alright. We'll go. As you say.
Sister..
Hmm?
Sister?
You don't even know how to get ready? Is this dress suitable for the wedding function?
Darken your lipstick at least. You have no fashion sense. Darken it.
No. I don't want to darken it. I like it like that.
Please, darken it a little at least. Sometimes I feel you have an old soul possessing you.
We're going to a wedding event.
I said I'm fine. Now lets go, we're getting late.
Look at me.
Am  I not looking I the most beautiful girl in the world?
Of course. You're the most beautiful in the world. Now should we go before the event finishes?
Please come. I'll make you meet everyone. This is Aaliya. She is my favorite cousin.
Really?
She is younger than me but she's very mature.
And Farheen, he?
He is her husband, Touqeer, and this handsome lad here is her brother in law, Kabeer.
Hello.
And Aaliya, she is Mrs. Sultana. Both these beautiful girls are her daughters, Nawal and Falak.
All praise to the Lord.
And Nawal is my daughter Anaya's childhood friend.
I don't know why I feel we've met before.
Yes. I think we met in a restaurant. Right?
Yes, what a beautiful coincidence. Our fate is making us meet again and again.
What if we keep meeting with this coincidence and then our fates intertwined too.
Kabeer and his talks.
Is your foot better now? Is it hurting?
Its a lot better now. I'm fine.
You didn't message me about your well being.
You have no idea how worried I was about you.
I kept your card somewhere and forgot about it.
Hmm. You know what?
I thought I am not someone people can ignore but you broke my heart.
I am like this.
Its not your fault.
If you're beautiful, you're bound to be complacent.
Its not your fault.
Its not your fault.
Tell me one thing. Do you judge everyone like this?
Of course not. Such a beautiful coincidence has never happened before.
Do you compliment every beautiful girl like this?
I've seen such a beautiful girl for the first time. Someone who is ignoring me.
I didn't compliment.
Then why are you wasting your precious time on me.
I don't think I'm wasting my time.
Then what do you think?
I think its the first time I'm spending time where I want too. I feel happy with you.
Do you?
I was amazed today. Kabeer didn't even once tell me that he is bored.
If we go on such functions, he always complaints that he's bored.
By the way you're absolutely right.
I didn't even see him anywhere.
Hmm..
Where were you?
I was there. There were a lot of people from our circle so I was busy talking to them.
Hmm..
I had a lot of fun too. I enjoyed a lot. And I also liked a girl for Kabeer in the function.
What? What are you saying? Please don't take away my independence yet. Let me be free.
Really?
Dear, you've been free for a long time. Everybody has to get married one day. Get ready now.
Alright, tell me, who is she.
I did take a picture and you've met her as well.
Show me the picture first, then I'd know who she is. How will I remember otherwise who I met?
But you don't want to get married. Whats the use of looking at the picture?
I didn't say I don't want to get married.
But you just said that you don't want to give away your freedom.
Exactly.
I was just joking. I believe in what brother says. Its something everyone has to do.
Alright..
Obedient.
All praise to the Lord.
So, where is it? Come here. Look at this.
Sister in law. How did you find out whats in my heart?
So you have now accepted my choice?
I knew you'd like Nawal. You know I really liked Nawal. She's so sober and mature. I know a girl like Nawal will suit him very well.
Sister in law, wait a minute. You're mistaken. I don't like Nawal. I like Falak.
What?
Falak?
Yes.
Are you serious? I thought she was stupid. I know she's beautiful.
But we cannot spend our life with our beauty. In fact Farheen was praising Nawal and her sensibility to me.
She is very innocent and beautiful. What you think is her stupidity, that's her innocence and I really like her.
Do you know brother, its the first time. The first time that I looked at a girl and felt as if she was made for me.
Wait a minute. The thing is that my brother has been flattered and since he has to spend his life, so it should be his choice as well.
Lets not force him and get him married to Falak.
Alright dear. Okay.
Kabeer's happiness is most important to us so we'll take a proposal for Falak. Happy now?
Very happy.
This is why I say you're the best sister in law in the world.
And you're the best wife in the world as well.
Nawal do you have any idea who is taking over our company?
No. I don't know. As it is, what difference does it make? We have to work only.
Hmm. It is a new company and they're launching in Pakistan for the first time.
I'm very scared. What will become of us?
Who knows how they'll be? I've also heard they'll fire 50% of the staff.
See, Sara, its very straight.
Those who are doing their job fine, why would a new company fire people who are doing their jobs?
You do your work. Don't focus here or there or else there will be no guarantee of your job.
Aren't you scared?
No. Why would I be scared? I'll work somewhere else if not else.
I have firm belief that where God has written bounties in your fate, you get it no matter what.
And if its not written, no matter how much you try, you'll return empty handed.
Excuse me mam. The new boss is joining tomorrow and he has called a meeting at 2pm.
Okay. Do one thing. Keep all the files ready.
I will have to give them to him tomorrow only. Also compile all meetings held last month in a file and email them to me.
Okay, mam.
Alright Nawal, I'll go and check if some work is left.
Come. Have a seat, please.
Thank you.
We came to see you with a special purpose.
Of course. Tell me.
Shaheen, get some refreshments dear.
I cannot see Nawal and Falak.
Nawal must be on her way back.
By the way, is everything alright? You called to see me in an emergency.
I was worried.
Yes everything is alright, thank God. Actually when I met you yesterday, I was very happy.
Even I was glad to meet you.
You met her brother in law yesterday.
Kabeer?
Yes.
Actually I really found both your daughters very sensible and well brought up.
Nawal and Falak, I really liked them both.
Thank you very much.
I'm looking for a girl for my brother in law these days and I'm here with a proposal from Kabeer for Falak.
Falak?
You have met Kabeer, you've seen him. Kabeer will keep Falak very happy.
Yes. I'm very happy that you came. Thank you very much but I cannot accept this proposal.
Actually Nawal is my elder daughter and Falak is younger.
If you had brought a proposal for Nawal I would have said yes but since its for Falak, I'll have to say no.
I want to get my elder daughter Nawal married first and then Falak.
In times like today, when an educated woman like you says such a thing, one is certainly surprised.
These are old wives tales. These days people don't wait to get their older daughters married first. This happened in the past.
You're right.
But everybody has their own thinking and I also think that I should get my elder daughter married first and then the younger one.
I will not force you at all but I'll tell you to discuss it with Nawal and Falak before you decide.
Whatever you decision is, you can call me. Whether you accept it or reject it, I'll not oppose it.
Alright Aaliya if you're forcing me, I'll definitely talk to them and I hope nothing I said has hurt you.
No. What are you saying? Its your right. They are your daughters.
Of course you'll decide what you think is best for them.
I really liked talking to you, today. Please I'll take your leave now.
Oh, how can it be?
You haven't eaten anything yet. The tea will be here any moment.
No. Thank you. We actually opened our new branch recently and there is a lot of work there. Kabeer and I are usually busy there.
I'll wait for your call.
Alright, then.
Should we leave Farheen? Okay bye.
Bye.
I'll have to say no because you brought the proposal for Falak. I'll get Nawal married first and then Falak later.
Why did mom say no to this proposal? They're such nice people. So rich. I don't know why she's doing this.
Mom, where is Falak?
She is in her room. She isn't feeling well. I've asked Shaheen to send her tea in her room.
Aaliya came today.
Really? What happened? Why was she here?
She brought a proposal from her brother in law Kabeer, for Falak.
What?
Mom, this is such a good news. Why did you wait before telling me? You're telling me so late.
What is so good about it?
She didn't bring a proposal for you. Its for Falak
So what? Falak got a proposal from such a good family. Its good news.
I said no.
What are you saying, sister in law? She said no. Why?
She wants to marry her elder daughter first.
Aaliya you should have tried to convince her.
What do you think? I didn't try? You're the limit.
I think I'm the best in public dealings among the three of us.
This is weird. Will she keep her younger daughter home, all her life, if her eldest isn't married first?
I've told you a thousand times Nawal. You're elder than Falak. You'll get married first
Mom, the proposal is from such a good family.
He is the owner of such a big business. He is good looking. There is nothing amiss.
What else do we need? People look for these things in a proposal.
What difference does it make if I or Falak get married first?
Tell me, did you mention this to Falak? Did you tell her?
I'm her mother. I'll decide. What does Falak know? She's a child.
Mom, you should have asked first before saying no.
You did wrong, you should have asked her first. The proposal was for her. She should know.
If you had to say No, you could have at least mentioned it to her.
Don't make me understand. I understand everything. You'll be married first because you're elder than her.
They said no with a useless reason. She could have asked for some time to think.
And Aaliya you should have also verified first whether her elder daughter was engaged or not.
I knew it. I did my homework before I went.
Mom when I have no objections, why are you objecting?
How can I make you understand dear?
If I marry off Falak first and you're not married by then,
everybody will talk. They'll question why I got Falak married first.
For God's sake mom. We're not answerable to anyone. We have to do whats best for us.
What people say or do shouldn't make a difference to us.
It does make a difference to me. This is why I did what I did.
I think you should talk one more time.
I don't think its feasible. She has said what she wants very clearly.
I don't know, its weird. Both of them have their own fates. Its not as if they're intertwined.
Everybody has their own thinking.
But even after she said no, I requested her to discuss with her daughters and then call me.
Alright. We can do nothing more. As it is, my brother doesn't lack girls. We'll find someone else.
Brother, what is wrong with you? How can we find another girl? I like Falak and I want to marry her. Its not a joke.
How will I marry someone else without liking her?
That's why they say matches are made in heaven. This was not meant to be. We'll find the one for you.
I really like their family. They're simple people. They have a valid point as well. I was thinking, if we,
could just ask them for Nawal.
Wait a minute.
 What is wrong with you people? You're not taking it seriously.
Kabeer.. We..
Kabeer.. Kabeer.. Oh..
What do you think about Nawal?
Aaliya please stop it. 
Why did you have to take Nawal's name in front of him?
We cannot force anyone. We sent a proposal but they said no. What can we do?
I'm saying, you should find a good girl in your social circle or in our family. They are so many girls around.
You're right. I have some in mind.
As it is, my brother lacks nothing. You'll see, he'll find a very good girl.
Touqeer I've never seen Kabeer reacting like this ever before.
You're right.
Hello?
Hie. Kabeer. Its Falak. I'm very sorry. I couldn't call or text you. I was a little busy.
Really. So you want to show me that I'm worthless for you.
No. Its nothing like that. You're misunderstanding.
It is so.
I'm telling you, its not that. As it is, I have very few people in my life who I think of as mine. You're one of them.
Really. If this is so, Why did you say no to my proposal?
What? What proposal are you talking about?
I don't know about it.
Falak I'm talking about my proposal. Aaliya brought a proposal from me. For you.
Seriously. I don't know about it. Mom didn't tell me.
Are you kidding? How is it possible that she didn't mention it to you.
Believe me, Kabeer. Mom didn't tell me about it.
Okay.
If she had asked you, what would you say?
I think I would have said yes.
Okay. I've got my answer. 
I think you should talk to your mother so that when my sister in law talks to her. She cannot say no.
Okay.
Its good to know your consent. I'm happy. Can you feel it too?
May be.
May be? This means I'll have to meet you to show how happy I am.
No. How can I meet you? Its very difficult.
If your intentions are clear, its easy to get what you want. Think of it as what I want.
I want to have dinner with you today.
But..
Its a request.
Alright. I'll try.
Why did you have to do all this?
Its nothing. 
You hold a very strong position in my heart.
If I could, I would have brought all the roses in the city for your welcome, here.
Falak. Your presence here is lightened up the room. Some people are like this.
Who knows when they enter someone's life, like a bright light.
 I want your love to brighten up my life. Forever.
Will you support me?
I'm asking you, for your life.
Will you hold my hand?
