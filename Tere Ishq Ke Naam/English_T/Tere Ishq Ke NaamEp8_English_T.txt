[00:14] they are not only documents
[00:16] there is jewelry as well, your mother's jewelry
[00:19] and you've got complete right on them. Rutba, your mother must have kept them for you, right?
[00:26] by any means, you have to bring that jewelry to your room from your father's room
[00:31] I wanted to feel her fragrance
[00:38] now I've seen it
[00:42] so it feels as if
[00:48] I have cried on my mother's shoulders
[00:55] I have felt her fragrance
[01:28] you couldn't do anything for me, mom
[01:31] my emotions are getting buried in the noise of these celebrations
[01:36] and when these emotions are buried once
[01:39] then a person is not considered dead or alive
[01:47] who can understand this pain better than me, Azka
[01:51] but I promise you that I won't let Rutba enter this house
[01:57] no matter if I have to die for it
[02:04] come on fix your mood & smile
[02:07] we have to smile, even though just for pretending
[03:42] Rutba is so lucky, right?
[03:46] as she is getting a loving life partner like you
[03:50] I wish she can value you
[03:53] she loves me from the bottom of her heart
[03:56] is this something less to love someone to this extent?
[04:01] but love needs proof, Altamash
[04:04] I had convinced her to marry you with so much of difficulty
[04:09] I had to swear upon your love to her
[04:12] then she had agreed
[04:14] as it is, she has always given priority to uncle's fear upon your love
[04:22] she gives importance to my love more than everything
[04:28] I have tested her many times
[04:33] will there be any doubt left if she will bring the documents of her father's lands & her mother's jewelry upon my orders?
[04:42] I wish whatever you are thinking must happen
[04:47] but I don't think so that Rutba will be able to do this
[04:51] uncle's fear will not let her do this
[04:56] don't you worry
[04:58] this will happen
[05:01] such a blind trust destroys a person
[05:04] if Rutba came empty hands
[05:09] then you won't be able to tolerate it
[05:12] when a person starts thinking more than requirement then he starts talking unnecessarily
[05:20] don't you worry!
[05:23] you just dance, sing, beat the drums & clap
[05:29] Rutba will be of Altamash's for sure
[05:35] and the entire world will see this celebration!
[05:42] be careful, if Rutba came back empty hands from there
[05:47] then you will hear the echo of these clapping
[05:51] as the echo of a slap
[06:35] Khursheed
[06:38] tomorrow is Rutba's wedding, and you haven't made any new clothes
[06:44] you're continuously busy in doing the work. I fear, what if you get sick
[06:49] mom, I am worried about uncle
[06:52] he is tolerating such a big grief all alone
[06:57] I fear, what if something happen to him
[07:00] God forbid dear, what are you saying?
[07:08] the mountains stand tall even after tolerating the harsh weathers
[07:13] but a human is not a stone
[07:16] someday, it breaks & shatters
[07:25] but then its his daughter's love which has still kept him gathered as of yet
[07:31] hmm...
[07:33] after all, Rutba has given such a big shock to her father
[07:40] mom, she also did a very big favor
[07:45] the basis of this house would have trembled, but she had save them
[07:52] anyways, kindly iron my white suit. I will wear it tomorrow
[08:00] again the same white dress!
[08:03] dear, there are holes in the shirt. What will the people say?
[08:08] just now I remember, my teacher had called. I am getting the first position, and the result will be announced day after tomorrow
[08:13] really! may God give more success to my son
[08:19] see, how you have forgotten the holes of my shirt in a moment
[08:26] when a person's medals are decorated on his chest then the patches on his dress seems to be expensive
[08:32] just pray that your son becomes so successful that...
[08:35] people don't see the patches on his clothes, instead his abilities
[08:41] my son has become so intelligent
[08:44] today, if your father would have been alive
[08:48] then he would have been so happy on your abilities
[08:56] now make me drink some tea
[08:58] let me bring it right away
[09:45] today is my daughter's day of departure ritual after marriage
[09:49] may God bless you
[09:52] every coming day shall be an Eid, and every coming night shall be festive for you
[09:57] I pray that no grief shall touch you ever
[10:01] I pray that you always stay happy, may God bless you with a lot of happiness
[10:14] we don't cry on such occasions
[10:16] we shall only smile & be happy
[10:21] aunty, I am missing my mother a lot
[10:24] if today, she had been here with me
[10:28] then I wouldn't have felt so alone & helpless
[10:37] look...
[10:39] nobody has applied henna on my hands
[10:41] how will I get ready, or how will I become a bride? Nobody cares for me here
[10:48] I know
[10:50] I know that Altamash must have planned a lot of things for me
[10:56] he must have done a lot for me
[11:00] but aunt, I had never imaged that I will leave my father's house like this
[11:09] how can father do this to me?
[11:12] how can he give me such a big punishment for my such a small mistake?
[11:17] how can he be so stone hearted for me, aunty?
[11:26] maam Rashida, the parlor woman is here for madam Rutba
[11:31] also the cameraman is coming. Sir had said its all your responsibility, so nothing should be missing
[11:38] tell brother that I am with Rutba until her departure ritual
[11:42] he shouldn't worry
[11:59] I had told brother everything myself in detail in front of you
[12:04] its impossible that Rutba shall come out of the mansion with documents & jewelry
[12:12] but... Rutba hasn't told any such thing to Altamash as of yet
[12:17] if any such thing would have happened, or if she would have been caught then she would have discussed it with Altamash
[12:24] she has got so many ways to contact him
[12:27] she did it so many times earlier as well
[12:29] the matter is very complicated
[12:32] how can brother tolerate such a big act of Altamash?
[12:36] and if he has caught Rutba red handed, then he must have created a chaos as of yet
[12:41] maybe uncle has beaten her, maybe he took back the documents & jewelry but...
[12:47] he had hid the matter due to the dear of defamation
[12:51] do one thing, go to Rutba's house right away
[12:54] and ensure Rutba that you both will attend the wedding from her side, not from Altamash's side
[13:00] I will bring the groom's family with sister Sanober
[13:02] what will happen by doing this?
[13:04] it will, Azka
[13:06] during the discussion try to find out from Rutba that whether she has brought the jewelry or not
[13:11] if she hasn't then we have to tell Altamash on the right time!
[13:15] I'm sure, he will leave without taking the bride with him
[13:19] nothing as such will happen
[13:20] you don't know Altamash, he can't even breathe without Rutba
[13:24] he will never leave from there without her
[13:26] Azka, you don't know Altamash
[13:29] men like Altamash never tolerates their insult
[13:33] do as I am asking you to do.
Go, get ready
[14:00] don't know what both of you are about to do now
[14:04] I don't understand what problem you both have with this relation
[14:20] come on be quick, put all these baskets inside the car
[14:25] Bazil, have you kept the baskets containing dry dates or not?
[14:29] we'll serve my brother's guests the dry dates for sure
[14:31] I have already asked them to keep it inside the car, don't worry
[14:34] Okay! everyone should know that we have come to take away our daughter-in-law
[14:40] please check it once
Okay I will
[14:43] hey Ronaq, you are coming right now? Go & check on your nephew
[14:47] don't know which creams he is applying, he hasn't got ready as of yet
[14:51] what are you saying, sister? Why he would be needing any cream?
[14:55] he is a moon, and today when he'll shine the entire world will see
[14:59] God willing... please go & check him
[15:03] don't forget anything, are you checking everything?
[15:08] keep all the baskets
[15:10] very good...
[15:14] why are you taking so long, come quickly Altamash?
[15:28] all praise to God! evil eye off
[15:35] my son is looking like a full moon
[15:38] where is Azka & Arfa?
[15:42] I had a word with brother Mehr Ali
[15:45] he seemed to be so angry, I got so afraid
[15:48] don't know what does he intend to do
[15:52] that's why I have sent them both over there, so that they can inform us about the situation there
[15:56] what do you mean?
[15:57] uncle had give the date of departure ritual himself, so what is the meaning of getting angry now?
[16:02] Altamash, I think he intends to insult you in public
[16:08] I pray to God that this respect, honor, pride & ego shall suit you
[16:13] because if brother will insult you in front of everyone
[16:18] then our respect of so many years will be ruined
[16:22] aunty, if anything will be ruined then it will be only uncle's pride!
[16:29] the people who had dreamt of lowering down Altamash's head have become unsuccessful badly
[16:34] you'll see
[16:37] I will bring everything after opening uncle's fist
[16:42] Rutba as well as uncle's entire wealth
[16:46] tomorrow's sun will tell you that the owner of the entire wealth is just Altamash
[16:53] Rutba is already yours Altamash
[16:57] but lift up your hand from all the other things
[17:00] because brother's anger is telling me that what he is about to do
[17:04] anyways, we'll soon get a call from Azka or Arfa. Then we'll get to know the situation there
[17:11] what discussion aunt & nephew is having? The guests are here, we are getting late already. Lets go
[17:17] let the call come from there, mom
[17:21] let us get to know uncle's intentions
[17:25] if uncle tried to insult us in front of everyone then I will tell him that...
[17:31] what is the actual insult!
[17:52] yes lawyer, this is what I am trying to explain you
[17:57] we have to transfer everything but only on Rutba's name
[18:02] I am busy right now, so lets meet tomorrow. I will call you to my house tomorrow
[18:09] thank you!
[18:13] uncle, all the guests have come outside. Also all the arrangements are done
[18:18] I think, you should give it a look
[18:22] Khursheed listen
[18:24] yes
[18:25] I will be left completely alone in this house after Rutba's departure
[18:30] do one thing, start living with me in this house along with Rasheeda
[18:36] just like my son
[18:40] uncle...
[18:44] I am not that capable
[18:46] besides, I wish to stay in your heart than rather than these tall walls
[18:53] your love in my heart is present like a love for a son, Khursheed
[18:59] do you have any doubt?
[19:02] No
[19:03] I love you like a father, Khursheed
[19:07] you have fulfilled your right of love & responsibilities
[19:16] the groom's family is about to come, I think I should go & meet Rutba
[19:21] after her departure, the face of life will look strange
[19:26] for the last time, I will like to meet my life with love
[19:34] uncle
[19:36] its very important for you to know what had happened on that day at the mansion
[19:42] Khursheed
[19:44] wait till Rutba's departure ritual
[19:47] but uncle...
[19:47] She is taking away the meaning of life with her
[19:51] then what's the point in worrying about the properties & wealth?
[19:54] already everything is hers
[19:58] yes
[20:15] only mine & Altamash's association is important 
[20:19] see...
[20:21] all of this is so pretty & beautiful
[20:25]  but still incomplete
[20:29] all of this will be completed when I & Altamash will be together 
[21:15] stay happy
[21:18] and prosperous, my dear
[21:27] I'm sorry dad for my every mistake & stupidity
[21:35] please forgive me
[21:38] dear...
[21:41] I've forgiven all the love, trust, belief
[21:48] and murders
[21:56] I'm a criminal
[21:59] but not a murderer
[22:04] the punishment you have fixed for me, I am accepting it happily
[22:12] dad, I am leaving this place forever
[22:17] I don't need anything from you in return
[22:21] only your prayers
[22:27] dear Rutba, just pray
[22:29] that your father's hands
[22:40] and lips shall have the ability to move
[22:49] nothing else is left though
[22:59] dad
[23:05] bye!
[23:56] what are you saying, uncle?
[23:59] how come Rutba do this?
[24:00] right now Rutba is like a puppet, whose all ties are in Altamash's hands
[24:08] this so-called, unsuccessful & show off love is like a poison
[24:15] if it spreads in one's nerves, then our own blood becomes rebellious
[24:20] it deceives..
[24:22] don't worry uncle
[24:24] Rutba won't be able to take a single thing from your room without your permission
[24:29] listen to me carefully
[24:31] whatever Rutba wants to take away from my room, let her take it
[24:38] you will only see, you will not stop her
[24:42] you will not interfere
[24:44] uncle, there are original property documents lying in your room
[24:49] and aunt's jewelry too
[24:51] what is this property?
[24:54] whenever I think about it, only Rutba comes in my mind
[24:58] and your aunt's jewelry is also of Rutba's
[25:02] She is just rebellious & disobedient but...
[25:06] I have a beating heart in my chest
[25:11] maybe you won't be able to understand this right now
[25:15] but when you will become a father then you will understand
[25:19] but uncle...
[25:20] if Rutba's happiness lies in taking away all these things with her
[25:23] then I will not stop her
[25:26] Okay, as you say so
[26:08] Altamash, lets go dear. We are getting late
[26:12] here our guests are also worried, and there my brother must be waiting as well
[26:16] I think we shouldn't be too late
[26:20] now whatever the situation will be, we will face it over there
[26:24] whether Mehr Ali Khan gets angry or show tolerance, why do we care?
[26:29] We have achieved our motive
[26:32] now Rutba is ours, as well as the documents
[26:36] don't talk about the documents, brother Bazil
we cannot say anything before hand
[26:40] if Rutba did not honored Altamash's words, then what will he be left with?
[26:46] then its better for the girl to stay at her father's house for now
[26:49] what are you saying, Ronaq? may your words have no effect!
[26:52] if we'll leave the girl over there after a lot of wedding preparations & expenses, then what did we get?
[26:57] only insult, what else?
[26:59] what's the big deal for brother Mehr Ali? He insults anyone in public, and he will humiliate us without thinking for a second
[27:06] let it be aunty
[27:08] an old lion is worth keeping in the zoo only
[27:13] shall we go, mom?
[27:15] lets tell uncle how to respect a son-in-law in public
[28:17] uncle see, whatever I had thought I have got it
[28:21] Altamash, its a joyous occasion
[28:23] you may do the calculations of profit & loss some other time
[28:27] come
[28:58] Rutba, where are the documents & jewelry?
[29:01] give them to me, so that I can handover them safely to aunt Sanober & Altamash before your departure ritual
[29:08] its very important
[29:12] its not very important
[29:16] only mine & Altamash's association is important
[29:20] see...
[29:22] all of this is so pretty & beautiful
[29:26] but still incomplete
[29:29] all of this will be completed when I & Altamash will be together
[29:34] you are thinking about Romance! and outside everyone is taking this matter on their ego
[29:38] but why?
[29:40] money, wealth, properties, lands... where all of this is running?
[29:47] all of this is mine & Altamash's
[29:52] today my father is angry but...
[29:55] he will agree soon, I am sure
[29:59] your belief shall go to hell!
[30:00] whatever I am asking you right now, give it to me before anyone comes
[30:08] Rutba
[30:10] have you brought everything?
[30:20] No
[30:22] I haven't brought anything
[30:26] I didn't find it right
[30:31] all of that is my father's possession
[30:37] I had a control over myself
[30:40] therefore, I had married Altamash
[30:45] but all of that is of my father's
[30:49] I cannot deceive my father in this way
[30:53] I have no control over it
[30:59] very good Rutba, I am so proud of you!
[31:03] you did very well!
[31:05] you have thought about your father before Altamash
[31:09] every good daughter shall do this
[31:12] so happy for you
[31:49] there is such a bad news for you, Altamash
[31:54] you have been wronged!
[32:00] after all Rutba has deceived you
[32:04] what as such Rutba did?
[32:07] she has told everything to uncle
[32:11] what?
[32:16] She came back empty hands from the mansion
[32:19] she says that she isn't so stupid to transfer all her things on your name & becomes dependent on you!
[32:25] she was saying that until the property will stay on my name, until then Altamash will be my slave
[32:31] and if it got transferred on Altamash's name, then I have to do his slavery
[32:38] she is coming back empty hands
[32:49] what are you saying! Why will Rutba say this?
[32:58] Altamash, my son.. you have been wronged big time
[33:05] brother Mehr Ali has played his trump card
[33:08] Rutba isn't bringing anything, neither the property documents nor the jewelry
[33:14] today you won't be taking Rutba Mehr Ali with you
[33:18] but an ordinary girl
[33:23] how come Rutba do this?
[33:25] she did it, because she is like this
[33:29] I don't know why you don't understand that Rutba is a selfish & self-centered girl
[33:34] that property is her weapon
[33:36] and she'll use it to make you her slave for life time
[33:41] if she will transfer it on your name then
[33:44] she has to stay like your maid, right?
[33:49] I don't understand, how can you marry a fraudster girl & spend your entire life with her?
[33:59] if I would have been in her place
[34:03] then I would have kept all of my belongings in your feet
[34:14] here comes Rutba
[35:34] this is the most beautiful moment of my life
[35:42] where are the documentats & jewelry, Rutba?
[35:57] Altamash, this is not the right time for this discussion
[36:03] wait for some time, I will tell you
[36:29] All praise to God, you both are looking so adorable. Stay blessed
[36:41] Rutba, you haven't answered me
[36:46] have you brought the documents & jewelry with you or not?
[36:50] Altamash please
[36:53] after whatever my father did
[36:57] at least you don't insult my love like this
[37:01] at least you keep my love's honor intact
[37:05] answer me about what I have asked you
[37:07] have you listened to me or not? Have you brought those things with you or not?
[37:20] No
[37:23] I haven't brought anything
[37:26] all of those things are of my father, and its better if they stay with him
[37:34] so it means Azka was absolutely correct!
[37:37] Rutba, you have shattered my love for you
[37:45] Altamash...
[37:57] Altamash
[37:58] what is the matter, Altamash?
[38:01] is there any problem? Talk to me
[38:09] what happen, Altamash?
[38:13] this is the moment of brother Mehr Ali's respect
[38:15] look, don't do any such thing which shall tarnish brother's ego or respect
[38:20] he is elder than you, & you are younger than him!
[38:26] so uncle, have you become successful in your motive?
[38:30] you have turned her against me
[38:33] but you & Khursheed together cannot make me bend
[38:42] Altamash, I have always done everything for my daughter's benefit & betterment
[38:48] Fine! then I will also do whatever I feel is right
[38:57] for your ego & satisfaction, you did whatever you like so I will also do whatever I like
[39:01] I will give you such a wound that you won't be able to forget for life time!
[39:03] Stop your rubbish, you absurd guy!
[39:06] you are not worthy enough, that I shall wed off my only daughter to you
[39:10] but still, I had handover her to you
[39:12] brother, my son came here to marry your daughter & your are insulting him!
[39:18] Ronaq is absolutely correct!
[39:21] that brother like to insult everyone in public
[39:25] what is this joke? End this spectacle
[39:29] Okay uncle, lets end it then
[39:37] listen to me very carefully
I am divorcing Rutba
[39:56] you cannot do this, Altamash
[40:01] Rutba, I divorce you!
[40:07] I divorce you!
I divorce you!
[40:24] Rutba...
[40:27] open your eyes
Rutba
[40:49] bring some water
[40:53] Rutba
Rutba
[41:10] thank you!
[41:13] thank you so much!
calm down
