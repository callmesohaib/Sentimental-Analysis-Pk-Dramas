[02:08] Good! So this job is lucky for you
[02:12] so when are you giving the treat to the staff?
[02:15] what?
[02:17] absolutely! its a tradition here that we share happiness & grief together
[02:23] at least a biscuit & a pastry with tea
[02:27] No sir, its not like that. I will give you a party at my home
[02:31] that's great! So we'll wait for your invitation
[02:35] Sure sir
[02:37] Can I leave now?
[02:51] Hi Tazmeen, are you going home?
[02:55] yes, since I don't have any class now so I thought of going home
[02:59] I didn't see Mr. Khursheed today
[03:01] he went home early. I have heard that he is busy in setting his house
[03:05] haven't you seen his wife?
[03:09] Mrs.?
[03:11] yes! he was telling the principal that his wife came over
[03:15] Strange, you haven't met her
[03:19] I had met her just like that, but the detailed introduction couldn't happen
[03:23] I have heard that Mr. Khursheed is giving a treat to everyone at his house
[03:26] its a good thing. See you, I am leaving
[03:31] Bye!
[04:18] Greetings! Sir Khursheed has sent this

[04:56] thank you so much for coming, please sit
[04:59] Greetings, how are you?
[05:42] have you got ready?
[05:44] yes
[05:47] tell me honestly
[05:50] am I glowing?
[05:55] I am looking more beautiful that Rutba, right?
[06:00] if you really want to look beautiful
[06:04] then remove Rutba from your mind
[06:09] until she will stay within you, you will not get the real happiness
[06:17] I have already got my share of happiness
[06:21] I haven't left anything for Rutba
[06:30] why the groom's family hasn't come as of yet?
[06:33] they must be coming
[06:35] alright then let me take your pictures
[06:55] what is this?
[06:56] its written here, its called instant geyser
[07:00] a small effort to fulfill the rights of my wife who used to spend a luxurious life
[07:09] don't stay in any delusion about me
[07:13] even if you will bring the moon & the stars from the sky
[07:16] Still, you cannot spend a happy married life with me
[07:22] therefore, don't keep any stupid desire ok?
[07:27] maybe you are having a misunderstanding about me, Rutba
[07:31] whatever I am doing is not to make you happy
[07:35] clean your mind, no matter how much efforts you have to do
[07:39] because its not easy to clean a few things
[07:44] I am not as fool as you think
[07:47] what do you think? Can't I see... this marriage announcements
[07:50] dinners, to invite people at home, to call friend over, to celebrate happiness. What is all this?
[07:57] I am warning you! if you keep on doing this then you will get so much insulted that you won't be able to handle its burden
[08:05] why you came here?
[08:09] to make your life a living hell!
[08:12] leave my life for me, and focus on your life
[08:18] whatever you want to do, and you feel is appropriate. Do it
[08:23] I will arrange a car for you in the morning
