[00:14] Azka what are you doing?
[00:15]  look at both of them
[00:18] how they are dancing together
[00:21]  Okay 
[00:21] I'm telling you, let me insult her once in this gathering full of people
[00:27] only after that Rutba will stay away from my husband 
[00:29] don't be mad Azka, what's with you!
[00:32] only a decent & graceful girl like you suits him
[00:41] Rutba, what are you saying? 
[00:53] for whom I had got ready?
[00:56] to show whom? To the world?
[00:59] to myself?
[01:01] or to the mirror?
[01:05] when he didn't looked at me
[01:08] even today, he has Rutba in his mind & heart 
[01:11] oho! what as such has happened that you are scratching your own face?
[01:15] Rutba is Altamash's cousin, and neither you or I can falsify this reality
[01:20] She is his choice! and you keep on falsifying this reality
[01:26] what's the matter?
[01:28] why are you yelling a lot?
[01:31] the walls of this house are not habitual to hear loud sounds of women
[01:36] they thrash it back on the face
[01:43] Altamash, even I feel like doing the same by thrashing that ugly sight on your face
[01:52] what not you haven't got by marrying me?
[01:55] all of those things you had desired for
[01:58] but still... maybe my love, passion & craziness got less in front of your desires
[02:05] aren't you done with uncle's wealth?
[02:09] even today you become crazy as soon as you see Rutba
[02:12] also you start wandering around her
[02:15] and she is the same Rutba
[02:18] whom you had divorced in front of everyone because she hadn't brought the property documents
[02:23] do you have a little shame or not?
[02:26] Azka!
[02:27] what's with you?
[02:29] why are you guys fighting like mad people?
[02:33] at least you show some shame, Azka
[02:36] however Altamash is a man... a man!
[02:39] but you are woman
[02:41] if not anything else, then at least care about your condition & your to-be born baby
[02:46] and what as such Altamash has done?
[02:49] did he married Rutba, or had he ousted you from the house? What is the problem?
[02:53] if he takes her name then I will tell him who am I!
[02:58] nobody can oust me from this house, not even all of you
[03:05] I am not Rutba, who will vanish from the sight so easily
[03:13] what do you think?
[03:15] you'll do conspiracies, schemes & create misunderstandings in order to remove Rutba from my life
[03:22] and you'll do all sort of wrong things in order to keep yourself in my life. And I won't get to know?
[03:34] its a lie! Who had said all this to you?
[03:37] just leave what is true & false
[03:40] you will regret a lot if I will say anything
[03:46] and yes
[03:48] if you'll be ousted from this house then it will be because of your jealousy from Rutba
[03:54] to hate her & to become jealous of her
[04:00] there is no need for you to get worried by thinking about her
[04:08] try to learn some patience
[04:22] did you hear what he was saying?
[04:24] what does all that mean?
[04:31] Azka, don't you think that the meanings of a lot of matters have been cleared
[04:35] maybe I don't know all of those things
[04:40] which you both knows
[04:59] what do you think?
[05:01] you'll do conspiracies, schemes & create misunderstandings in order to remove Rutba from my life
[05:08] and you'll do all sort of wrong things in order to keep yourself in my life. And I won't get to know?
[05:18] I have told you everything. Each & everything 
[05:22] mom & Azka's conspiracies, schemes. Their false claim of love
[05:27] All those things due to which you & Altamash were separated
[05:32] Arfa!
[06:10] again your BP has increased, Mr. Khan
[06:14] what as such you are eating?
[06:18] yes doctor, they say that there is some salt in the tears & its good to shed them
[06:25] but if you keep them within yourself then it creates BP
[06:30] you take your health quite non-serious
[06:34] I will give his diet plan, and you have to follow that only
[06:37] better doctor
[06:39] oh doctor, why are you killing me like this?
[06:43] tea without sugar, and less spicy curry
[06:47] if I could do all this then why I would have been on the bed? Wouldn't I be running outside?
[06:52] since you don't take our words seriously, so we will also not listen to any of your protests
[06:59] and yes, I will come again day after tomorrow to do your check up
[07:03] and during this, you are not allowed to do any long travel
[08:08] come on dear be quick, keep it in the car. Its quite late
[08:11] be quick!
[08:13] I won't spare her!
Azka!
[08:15] where are you going like a storm?
[08:17] to break her face! I will thrash her so hard that she will remember
[08:21] she is planning against me, right?
She is adding poison in my life
[08:24] Azka! stay in your senses. What's wrong with you?
[08:28] its your sister's wedding today, she is a bride. She will leave this house today
[08:32] you can fulfill your desires of fighting later. This is not the right time for such things
[08:37] this is the right time to fix her!
[08:39] She acts innocent in front of all, right?
she wants to ruin my life
[08:42] now you'll see what I will do with her life..
Azka... Azka!
[08:48] maam, the photo shoot is done. Now we are going towards the wedding hall
[08:51] yes yes, you guys can leave. We are also coming with the bride
[09:01] hey Azka, its good that you came. I was waiting for you since so long
[09:06] now quickly tell me that how am I looking
[09:11] what happened? Why are you looking at me like this?
[09:16] you are just looking like a fraudster
[09:20] and that too such kind of a fraudster, who doesn't even see while deceiving that her own blood is on the other side
[09:28] what is your problem?
[09:29] what jealousy do you have from me & Altamash? Tell me today!
[09:34] so much of insecurity by my marriage with him! I will ensure to ask you today...
[09:38] leave my hand! 
Have you gone mad?
[09:41] what as such I have done?
[09:43] I had never thought bad about you, Azka
I had never been jealous of your happiness
[09:49] but you got this quality in your inheritance
[09:52] be quiet, Arfa!
[09:54] look at her tongue!
[09:57] ill-mannered girl, tell mom
[10:00] Tell her that how you have told each & every matter to Rutba in detail
[10:04] she has told everything to Rutba 
[10:07] that how we had made every false matter true & vice versa to get Altamash
[10:12] she has told her all about the misunderstandings that we had created in between both the families
[10:17] what!
[10:18] She is crazy.. I will...
Azka!
[10:22] what's with you? there is no need to announce this in the entire neighborhood
[10:27] be quiet! 
Let me ask her
[10:30] Arfa, come with me
[10:32] mom...
come with me
[10:37] come here
[10:39] why you have said all these things to Rutba?
[10:42] speak up, did you or not?
[10:46] yes!
[10:48] I have told Rutba everything
[10:53] because it had become difficult for me to tolerate the burden of the sins of both of you guys
[10:58] I only have you two in this world
[11:02] she is talking non-sense!
[11:05] how could I live my entire life by knowing the selfishness & hidden hypocrisy in the real relations?
[11:15] uncle is my ideal since childhood
[11:20] and with great courage he had always tolerated his sisters hypocrisy
[11:24] he had never complained
[11:27] and you guys have ruined Rutba's life!
[11:31] but uncle... 
[11:34] uncle gave Azka a lot of wealth & Altamash both
[11:41] Rutba doesn't have that much right
[11:44] that she should be aware of all these things?
[11:47] maybe, she can forgive you gives in some big or true moment
[11:54] and I have told her everything by thinking about it
[11:57] and she has told all this to Altamash
[12:00] He knows everything. 
She has told him each & every matter
[12:04] now tell me, how will I spend my life with Altamash after all this?
[12:10] how will our marriage continue? How will I live in that house?
[12:14] Answer me!
[12:16] Azka, you should be asking all the answers of these questions from yourself
[12:20] when you came in between Altamash & Rutba
[12:23] stop this rubbish!
[12:35] save these slaps for later, you will be needing them
[12:44] it doesn't suits you to slap your sister, who is a bride right now
[12:56] Rutba dear... 
[12:58] there has been some misunderstanding
[13:00] don't know what wrong Arfa had said to you in her stupidity, there isn't any such thing 
[13:04] Please don't believe on her words at all
[13:09] don't worry aunty, now I don't believe anyone
[13:16] actually I came to pick you
[13:19] hmm...
[13:21] aunty, I am taking Arfa to the hall in my car
[13:27] you & Azka shall come over there with Arfa's important stuff
[13:32] yes, you guys go... we are coming
[13:35] lets go...
oh yes!
[13:38] I had a word with Altamash
[13:43] I had told him that Arfa & I will go to the hall
[13:47] he will also come over there directly
[13:49] So, don't wait for him
[13:57] lets go!
[14:05] what did she said?
[14:07] what's in her heart?
[14:09] she will snatch Altamash from me
[14:12] I am telling you, she will snatch him
[14:13] Azka... go, get ready & lets go to the hall with me
[14:17] I don't want to go anywhere
[14:20] what's wrong with you? Get back to your senses!
[14:24] Azka, listen to me very carefully. There is no need to tell the world that what is happening with you
[14:29] Altamash is not as easy task that if your work is not done by legitimate ways, then you are obliged to consider "other" ways.
[14:33] He is an ember! If you will not be careful then you'll ruin your house as well as family
[14:38] do as I ask you to do. Go, get ready
[14:41] Go!
[16:38] Rutba
[16:40] hey Altamash, how are you?
[16:42] I am fine
[16:46] but whenever I meet you, you become more beautiful than earlier
[16:53] what as such do you think?
[16:56] tell me
[16:59] don't you think that there are a few mistakes which cannot be rectified
[17:13] stop looking at me like this, people are watching they'll talk wrong about us
[17:17] then tell me, where are we meeting after this event?
[17:21] the question is.. why do we have to meet?
[17:27] because its important to meet now
[17:30] I already did a mistake once, so I won't do it next time
[17:36] I want to repent my mistake
[17:40] I promise you
[18:10] Azka
[18:12] see... 
[18:17] Ok come on, now don't make any spectacle here. As its your sister's wedding
[18:22] come, we'll see them later
[18:25] you only say that we'll see them
[18:27] Azka
[18:28] but you don't do anything
[18:35] I have already been ruined once in the fire of these promises
[18:43] but its fine
[18:46] if you say so, then lets do it
[18:51] but whenever we'll meet now, we'll meet somewhere outside
[19:35] I want to feel the sentiment of your love
[19:39] I want that sight with whom you see Rutba
[19:43] the smile that comes on your face by looking at her
[19:52] I am ready to transfer Saeedpur's land in your name
[19:59] in return, I just want your support
[20:45] all praise to God, both are looking so adorable
[20:51] Rutba
yes
[20:53] I wanted to talk about Arfa
[20:57] see, she got married as well but she is quite stupid
[21:01] She isn't wise at all. She talks completely non-sense
[21:05] she is my daughter but she is like this since her childhood, she usually tells lies
[21:11] don't take any of her words to your heart, also don't believe them. Ok?
[21:15] Absolutely aunty, don't you worry. I will do it like that
[21:20] but... as far as Arfa is concerned. She is quite an intelligent girl
[21:27] She knows the difference between right & wrong
[21:31] I am very happy that Arfa is my cousin, in fact sister
[21:37] I wish...
[21:39] Azka would have been like her
[21:43] but don't know like whom she is
[21:46] anyways Rutba, what's done is done
[21:50] just don't say anything to brother Mehr Ali, anything. Ok?
[21:55] it will create misunderstandings between the siblings, right?
[21:59] you haven't understood my father as of yet, right?
[22:03] aunty, dad can never misunderstands anyone
[22:06] because dad's presumption is always accurate
[22:20] greetings!
[22:22] greetings!
how are you, Rutba?
[22:24] I am absolutely fine, how are you aunty?
[22:26] All praise to God, you are looking so pretty
you are also looking very beautiful
[22:31] Whenever I see you, it feels as if I am looking at brother Mehr Ali
[22:36] how is he feeling now?
[22:39] yes aunty, dad's condition is not too good to travel
[22:43] otherwise he would have come for sure. I will go to him as soon as I will get free from here
[22:47] Okay, travel safe
[22:51] I will also call him once I get some free time
[22:56] hey Ronaq, heartiest congratulations!
[23:00] you saw me?
[23:01] hey, when do you get away from my sight?
[23:03] congratulations to you too! Please come
[23:05] All praise to God, both of them are looking so adorable
[23:09] such an adorable couple
[24:17] why are you stunned in to silence?
[24:20] its not a snake but a serpent
[24:23] by the way, somebody has said the right thing
[24:26] a poisonous thought is also like a serpent
[24:30] if it gets into one's mind, then it makes that person helpless & deserted
[24:36] those women are so helpless who sees their husband sitting in the feet of another woman in front of their eyes
[24:46] and it seems as you have fallen on the face
[24:49] I can't see you face even
[24:52] Azka, how do you used to find my face before falling in love with me?
[24:57] at least, you have accepted that Azka had fallen in love with you
[25:01] there is no past in love
[25:04] there is only present in love, my darling
[25:07] a dead love is way too worse than a stinking animal. It starts stinking!
[25:14] Altamash, please don't do this to me
[25:19] I won't be able to tolerate it
[25:21] if not mine then at least think about your to-be born baby
[25:25] what else can be precious for both of us than the baby?
[25:28] it can witnessed that Altamash is not doing any sort of injustice with you
[25:35] Azka, stop crying everytime
[25:39] I want to feel the sentiment of your love
[25:43] I want that sight with whom you see Rutba
[25:47] the smile that comes on your face by looking at her
[25:56] I am ready to transfer Saeedpur's land in your name
[26:03] in return, I just want your support
[26:48] I will not give you an answer for any of your allegations
[26:51] we answer those people whom we give importance to
[26:55] and you are nowhere in between me & uncle
[26:59] remember this!
[27:08] if I had such a father
[27:10] then I would have respected him a lot
[27:13] you got so much of love without asking
[27:16] without any efforts, you have all those blessings & luxuries in your house that a lot of people doesn't have
[27:27] you are taking undue advantage of your father's love, Rutba
[27:45] until we are tied in this relationship
[27:49] We are restricted to each other, legally, religiously & ethically
[27:57] neither you are free nor I
[28:35] I hope that a witch or ghost hasn't affected you. Because you are laughing after seeing me
[29:21] Greetings madam!
[29:34] dad
[29:36] Rutba
[29:41] how are you?
[29:43] I've been walking since last one hour while waiting for you. Tell me, how do I look?
[29:49] you look weak
[29:50] wrong!
[29:52] at the moment, I am feeling so powerful
[29:56] I was thinking about you
[29:59] what?
[30:00] that when one needs to get imprisoned in the clock's dial, while fulfilling the punishment of separation
[30:07] then we get to know that we are those people who have lost in the game of love
[30:13] Okay, how was everything over there?
[30:17] everything was fine over there
[30:21] but dad... when everything gets fixed in the lives of such people
[30:26] then we do feel amazed, right?
[30:30] dear, if they are our loved ones then not only we feel amazed but we also feel satisfied
[30:36] that our good & naive intentions, become the repentance of their sins as well
[30:41] but dad...
will you discuss everything here?
[30:44] I haven't eaten anything since morning while waiting or you. I am so famished
[30:48] lets go & have lunch
lets go!
[30:52] Okay tell me, were you really walking since last one hour?
[30:55] absolutely!
[31:02] how is my son? I pray for you day & night
[31:07] may God bless you with success, long life & a lot of happiness
[31:14] I am absolutely fine, mom
its all because of your prayers
[31:17] otherwise, what as such special quality I had?
[31:21] Khursheed, I have become so sad. When will you come back?
[31:27] its been only two days that I have landed here, and you are talking about my departure
[31:34] did you talk to Rutba & brother Mehr?
[31:41] I had a word with uncle, but maybe Rutba is busy in her cousin's wedding
[31:46] but you could have called her
[31:49] she is your wife not a neighbor, with whom you'll talk in your free time
[31:53] okay mom, I am getting late
[31:56] do call her, she will become happy. She must be waiting
[32:00] yes Okay, I will talk to her tomorrow
[32:02] at least listen to me, Khursheed!
[32:27] dear, its not an easy task to bring people towards education in such a feeble minded area
[32:37] the people here are poor as well as innocent
[32:42] they send away their children to the city for earning in a very young age
[32:50] so that their house can be run easily
[32:54] if we have to educate them, then we need to provide them all the faculties free of cost
[33:01] school's building, furniture, uniform, shoes, bags and allowance against studying
[33:10] are you getting it?
[33:13] now I've understood
[33:16] that why you give such a big amount's cheque to manager Nisar every month
[33:24] but dad, while doing all this had you never thought that your wealth & money will lessen?
[33:34] how I would have felt that, Rutba?
[33:36] because my wealth had never lessened
[33:40] its a treasure that kept on filling
[33:42] the prayers of poor people, the tears of joy, the faces full of hopes
[33:51] satisfaction, happiness, sweet & true sleep and satisfied heart
[33:58] dear, these are the human's biggest & most precious treasures
[34:06] greed & lust eats away a person's happiness like a termite
[34:12] dad, a person shouldn't be so naive that anyone can eat away their happiness whenever they want to
[34:19] learn to forgive my dear
[34:22] its a blessing
[34:25] A solace which keeps a person protected from fire
[34:53] what are you thinking, dear?
[34:58] Come on, get ready to go to the city
[35:03] yes dad
[35:49] she has told everything to Rutba
[35:51]  that how we had made every false matter true & vice versa to get Altamash
[35:56] I only have you two in this world 
[36:00] how could I live my entire life by knowing the selfishness & hidden hypocrisy in the real relations?
[36:07] you haven't understood my father as of yet, right?
dad can never misunderstands anyone
[36:12] because dad's presumption is always accurate
[36:38] dear Rutba
[36:40] I am feeling happy to see that you have understood & recognized the importance of education
[36:49] and have accepted it too
[36:52] education is the biggest achievement of one's life
[36:57] after that, there is an achievement of actions
[37:04] I have talked to the VC, dad
[37:08] it was your desire that I should complete my graduation, right?
[37:12] So, first I will complete my graduation & then I will do masters as well
[37:16] God willing
[37:19] dear, whatever you do. Do only as per your heart's voice
[37:26] like Khursheed
[37:32] did you talk to Khursheed?
[37:39] actually he is quite busy, dad
[37:43] I don't disturb him much
[37:46] we do talk sometimes
[37:49] yes, its like that dear
[37:52] even I just had hi hello!
[37:54] but dear, its my life's biggest desire to see you happy with Khursheed
[38:04] there is always a fear
[38:08] the decisions I have made for you, being a father
[38:15] don't know whether you have accepted them with the bottom of your heart or not
[38:19] dad, I accept all of your decisions from the bottom of my heart
[38:24] I can see everything, I understand everything
[38:29] that why you always used to keep me away from my aunt & her children
[38:34] and why you never used to like Altamash for me
[38:39] I can understand everything
[38:43] I can see all the wounds on your heart
[38:50] I will repent for all of your griefs, dad
