[00:12] its very easy to win a man's heart 
[00:15] specially that man who is already hurt by another woman
[00:21] the antidote of a poison is poison 
[00:24] and the antidote of an injury given by a woman is only an ointment applied by another woman
[00:28] are you getting me?
[00:30] Rutba, please don't cry. I promise you that I will wipe all of your tears
I will give you so much of happiness that you will forget everything 
[00:37] Rutba, we'll be together once again
[00:40] I promise you
[00:49] don't know why Altamash is taking so long
[00:51] I have called him so many times to come & have dinner with us
[00:55] yes mom
[00:56] Altamash, where have you been the food is getting cold
Altamash!
[01:01] brother
[01:04] uncle!
[01:07] what are you doing, brother?
[01:09] those who don't understand the language of love
[01:13] and who thinks that its justified to kill one's belief & trust
[01:18] they aren't capable to treated well, and I have come to explain that
[01:24] don't compel me
[01:27] to make your life a living hell!
[01:33] I have left all the relations associated to you as a charity of my daughter
[01:40] don't try to decorate such useless relations on your head once again
[01:46] otherwise neither the relations will be left
[01:49] nor head
[02:09] what was brother saying?
[02:12] uncle is licking his wounds
[02:17] but he doesn't know that his old bones doesn't have an energy to compete me
[02:23] to accept defeat so easily
[02:28] is not Altamash
[03:03] what is this!
[03:05] Rutba, you haven't done your breakfast as of yet. It has become cold
[03:09] until when you'll hurt yourself for others?
[03:14] take away the breakfast, aunty
[03:17] I don't want to eat
[03:19] I will ask for it if I will feel hungry
[03:27] Rutba, Khursheed wants to talk to you about something
[03:36] aunty, I don't want to talk to anyone about anything
[03:42] I have lost the trust from words and...
[03:45]  I feel scared of everyone's face
[04:13] Rutba, I am going
[04:16] I have got a job as a lectures in Hassanabad
[04:21] I will leave within two days
[04:26] best of luck!
[04:30] you had bothered to inform me, if wouldn't have made any difference if you wouldn't have informed me
[04:36] I know it doesn't make any difference to you
[04:41] but a person who is going on a journey needs prayers
[04:46] if I have ever hurt you or you had felt bad because of me, then please forgive me
[04:55] I don't have a heart anymore
[04:59] a person who is buried, then how can we discuss their wounds?
[05:04] don't waste your time
[05:10] a person is not so weak that an accident can take away the ability to laugh & live its life
[05:18] so why are you showing yourself so weak?
[05:24] your heartbeat is saying that you are still alive
[05:30] the days are yours, the nights are yours
[05:34] the time is yours
[05:37] what's the big deal if a person has left you in the middle of nowhere
[05:43] your steps are still with you
[05:51] you hadn't discussed love
[05:56] the things you have mentioned are incomplete without love
[06:04] its very easy to repeat the things written in the book
[06:11] but when a person gets hurt then he gets to know its reality
[06:20] I wish... 
[06:24] I wish you can understand it someday
[06:29] the pain of incomplete love
[06:45] an incomplete love is a person's biggest strength, Rutba
[06:53] I wish you can understand this as well
[07:03] I'm leaving
[07:06] bye!
[07:14] do take very good care of yours & uncle
[07:20] your most precious thing is still with you
[07:52] mom
[07:53] yes
[07:54] uncle had left in so much of anger
[07:56] I fear, what if he took my name over there then Altamash will never talk to me again
[08:01] Azka, you don't need to worry or get scared at all
[08:06] it was very important that Altamash shouldn't contact Rutba by any means
[08:11] you are right, Ronaq
[08:14] brother, Greetings!
[08:18] you came here all of a sudden, is everything alright?
[08:21] greetings uncle!
[08:22] greetings, stay blessed
[08:30] brother, you came to my house. Believe me, I feel so happy
[08:36] how is Rutba now?
[08:38] Arfa had told me about her condition
[08:41] I felt so restless after hearing about it
[08:46] I don't understand
[08:48] that they didn't pity a bit while doing so much of injustice to that orphan girl
[08:53] and Altamash! how can he be so cruel
[08:57] my own sister can be so heartless!
[09:04] Ronaq, do you remember
[09:06] you had married Mazara's son without our father's consent & permission
[09:14] yes brother, but its such an old matter
[09:19] then why are discussing it now?
[09:22] our father has disinherited you, and he has ordered that none of the family member will meet you in their entire life
[09:30] not they will see your face
[09:34] it was me
[09:36] who took stand for you
[09:40] against dad's orders
[09:43] I had fought your case with my consent & got you divorced
[09:46] also got you married to your childhood fiance Hashim, by begging in front of them
[09:55] Ronaq, do you remember everything or you have forgotten?
[10:00] yes brother, I do remember. How can I forget it?
[10:03] the same way people forget others favors
[10:08] and they remember only revenge by considering the fate's decision as injustice
[10:13] No brother, I can never do that
[10:17] and I apologize if you think that I have done anything wrong
[10:24] to forgive, forget & do the favor. Only big people can do that
[10:30] only a high character person can justify it, and people who are blessed can give this justification
[10:42] what is this, brother?
[10:44] its justification, Ronaq
[10:46] maybe you can remember this
[10:53] these are the documents of Saeedpur land, which I am transferring on Azka's name
[11:14] you must have an idea about the cost of Saeedpur land
[11:23] but this land will only be transferred on Azka's name 
[11:27] when Azka & Altamash will get married
[11:40] I hope that you will be able to agree Sanober & Altamash
[11:48] I will wait for this news tonight
[11:54] please accept my apologies as I won't be able to attend the wedding because of self-respect
[12:02] you can keep the properties as well as Altamash
[12:34] uncle, what have you done?
[12:36] Saeedpur's land is the biggest part of your wealth
[12:41] Khursheed, a person cannot eat wealth & properties
[12:46] but its greed eats away a person for sure
[12:50] money is such a weird thing!
[12:53] the more its importance is increased in life, the more the life gets devalued
[13:02] nothing seems good
[13:06] we do have an authority on the world
[13:10] but what we lack is real happiness
[13:17] a person live its life on the basis of happiness, Khursheed
[13:22] not on the basis of money
[13:26] you are right but.. 
[13:28] on whomsoever's name  you have transferred the property, even today they are not loyal to you
[13:33] it doesn't make any difference to me
[13:36] I just want peace
[13:40] my sisters think that my father did injustice to them
[13:46] and their brother is not giving them their rights!
[13:50] although, I had given them their share more then right
[13:56] but only literate people can understand these things
[14:00] not to those people who are dwelling in greed
[14:03] and a thought which gets blinded by greed & means, is not capable of understanding the right things
[14:11] now if Altamash gets married to Azka
[14:16] then the Saeedpur property can become the basis of peace & satisfaction in between both the families
[14:25] secondly, the most important thing is that Khursheed
[14:30] I have given it as a charity of my daughter's life
[14:36] Ronaq & Azka's jealousy
[14:40] has poisoned Rutba's life
[14:44] now I have to keep her safe
[14:46] not only Saeedpur's property, but if my entire wealth gets wasted on this
[14:53] then it doesn't make any difference to me
[15:16] what are you saying, Ronaq!
[15:20] show me
[15:27] these are Saeedpur land's complete documents
[15:33] just think that we have won a lottery
[15:35] maybe you haven't heard correctly
[15:38] all of this will be transferred on Azka's name only when she will get married to Altamash
[15:45] what do you both think? Will Altamash agree for this wedding?
[15:50] you tell me, are you agreed sister?
[15:52] I... 
[15:54] yes, why would I disagree?
[15:57] both of them are equal for me
[16:00] there isn't any difference in both of them. Both of them are my own
[16:04] the real thing is that what Azka & Altamash decides
[16:09] what will Azka say? She will only do whatever I will ask her to do
[16:14] my Azka is not rebellious & stubborn like Rutba. I have done very nice upbringing of hers
[16:19] as far as Altamash is concerned, then I am sure that he will agree for sure
[16:26] how can you be so sure about it?
[16:30] sister, what Rutba has given to Altamash except for wounds? and what can she give in the future too?
[16:36] my Azka knows how to become an ointment, and how to apply it as well
[16:42] just try to know Altamash's consent from him
[16:46] actually brother has given me just tonight's time
[16:51] I have to answer him as well
[16:53] I'm leaving
[17:10] I used to think that only uncle is stone hearted
[17:14] but Rutba is more clever than him
[17:17] she isn't sad about anything
[17:20] it seems as if hatred & anger has made her go blind
[17:24] she ran away to uncle soon after talking to you
[17:27] She told him each & every single word that you have said to her
[17:31] she is the one who has provoked uncle
[17:36] so it means that Rutba wants to take revenge
[17:39] obviously! what else she would have in her heart except of revenge & hatred?
[17:49] you are so nice, Altamash
[17:52] this personality, these speaking eyes
[17:56] Rutba never deserved you
[17:59] she has always considered you as a part of some wealth, or land
[18:08] and uncle! even he doesn't recognizes people
[18:12] how can he beat you!
[18:16] if not today then tomorrow, uncle has to pay for it
[18:22] he has already paid for his stupidity
[18:26] uncle has realized his mistake very quickly
[18:29] he has become fed up of Rutba's stupidities
[18:35] what do you mean? What are you trying to say?
[18:44] Altamash, do you know
[18:47] when a fate has to gift someone then
[18:51] it makes a person sits with that person who loves him the most
[18:58] and rejecting a loved one
[19:02] is equivalent to rejecting the fate's gift
[19:07] you don't ever do this mistake
[19:18] Altamash, I want to discuss something important with you in private
[19:44] disappointment & hopelessness binds a person with darkness
[19:54] dad, a raindrop affects on the soft sand
[19:59] I have become stone hearted 
[20:03] and stones doesn't get affected by anything
[20:13] Altamash, you have done the mistake of rejecting Rutba
[20:17] you have kicked your fate yourself
[20:21] now don't make the mistake of rejecting Azka
[20:24] brother has paid such a huge amount for accepting her
[20:28] what if you lose half of the things in the greed of complete
[20:31] but why uncle did this? Why he has transferred the land on Azka's name?
[20:35] because he wants to keep you away from Rutba's shadow 
[20:39] and now he will do this
[20:44] Altamash, dear please marry Azka
[20:49] I fear, what if brother changes this decision as well
[20:56] you won't get anything, Altamash!
[21:07]  you have done the mistake of rejecting Rutba
[21:10] you have kicked your fate yourself
[21:12] now don't make the mistake of rejecting Azka
[21:15] brother has paid such a huge amount for accepting her
[21:18] what if you lose half of the things in the greed of complete
[21:21] but why uncle did this? Why he has transferred the land on Azka's name?
[21:26] because he wants to keep you away from Rutba's shadow 
[21:30] and now he will do this
[21:32] Altamash, dear please marry Azka
[21:35] I fear, what if brother changes this decision as well
[21:39] you won't get anything, Altamash!
[21:54] hello!
[21:56] Arfa, is everything fine that you have called?
[21:59] brother Altamash, actually I wanted to talk to you about something important
[22:02] yes Arfa, tell me
[22:05] first promise me that this matter will always stay with the both of us
[22:10] Okay, tell me
[22:13] brother Altamash, please marry Azka
[22:17] I beg you, please don't reject this proposal
[22:21] she will die
[22:23] Arfa
[22:25] what are you saying?
[22:27] I am telling the truth, brother Altamash
[22:30] she has only loved you since her childhood
[22:36] if nature has distanced you from Rutba, then hold Azka's hand
[22:42] there is a betterment for all of us, you will stay happy with her
[22:45] she loves you a lot
[23:00] so this is the matter
[23:02] alright Azka! so I will accept you for sure
[23:06] if you are so desperate to enter in my life, then let it be
[23:10] now you will give me the proprieties of Saeedpur & I will take over a lot of other things from uncle
[23:18] as far as Rutba is concerned
[23:20] then Rutba was of Altamash's and Rutba will always stay of Altamash's
[23:41] uncle
[23:43] I am leaving day after tomorrow
[23:45] I have completed all the important work, but tell me if something is left
[23:52] yes Khursheed, one of the most important work is left
[23:56] I am thinking to complete it tomorrow
[23:58] yes yes, please order
[24:00] No dear, not order
[24:04] consider it as a request, I hope you will fulfill it
[24:14] yes Ronaq
[24:16] congratulations brother! Altamash as well as sister Sanober has agreed
[24:21] congratulations to you too, Ronaq
[24:25] I should get the rest of the details tomorrow
[24:30] I have called the lawyer tomorrow night
[24:33] yes, don't you worry brother. I will send you the wedding video
[24:39] not to me, send it to Rutba
[24:44] I like the things on the right place
[24:48] Okay better
[24:50] yes, Bye!
[25:04] congratulations Khursheed, tomorrow is the wedding
[25:08] whose wedding?
[25:10] yours & Rutba's
[25:47] Azka will never get that importance in my life that Rutba had
[25:51] you people will be responsible if something happened to her
[25:54] Ronaq & Azka will be responsible for it
[25:57] We aren't doing this marriage to make them happy & satisfied
[26:01] We have to recover our loss at any cost
[26:05] brother Mehr & Rutba has betrayed us
[26:07] they had kept us in the delusion for so many years, that Rutba is ours
[26:11] and now when it comes to the distribution of properties, so he gave an entire share to Ronaq & Azka
[26:15] both of them are more close to him, and we are nothing
[26:18] why not mom? We are...
[26:22] we are his enemies
[26:24] and this relation is heavier on every relation
[26:29] uncle doesn't want our friendship
[26:34] now we'll show him how to be an enemy
[26:38] very good my son!
[26:42] and I'm doing this marriage only for the sake of the property, remember this
[26:47] Azka isn't dearest to me as well
[26:49] anyways, we have to fulfill our motive
[26:52] We cannot leave the Saeedpur property at any cost
[26:57] and what inappropriate condition he has kept of doing the marriage right away
[27:06] Mehr Ali doesn't move his pawn uselessly
[27:12] somewhere he has to save a king
[27:56] whether its a wind...
[27:59] water, light or hope
[28:03] it makes it own path
[28:07] and a person who knows its path
[28:11] we shouldn't delay in holding their hands
[28:15] Rutba, disappointment & hopelessness binds a person with darkness
[28:27] dad, a raindrop affects on the soft sand
[28:32] I have become stone hearted
[28:36] and stones doesn't get affected by anything
[28:40] this incident has changed your way of talking
[28:47] you think before speaking, also you have started to talk so deep
[28:54] when the meaning of words starts changing
[29:00] then understand that a heart has started his journey
[29:05] God willing, the result will be good
[29:09] which result?
[29:12] what is left now?
[29:20] your cellphone
[29:24] tomorrow evening is your wedding with Khursheed Hasan
[29:29] I hope that you will not disappoint me this time
[29:35] I have bowed down in front of your contumacy
[29:38] but if I will face disappointment this time
[29:44] now its your turn Rutba
[29:47] try to test my choice too
[29:50] believe me, you will not be disappointed
[29:56] but still I am not forcing you
[30:02] if you heart doesn't agree, then you may refuse before the wedding
[30:08] neither I will mind
[30:12] nor Khursheed Hasan
[31:03] Khursheed, how can I tell you about my heart's feelings?
[31:07] honestly, today if my dear sister Sajida would have been alive then she would have seen with her own eyes
[31:16] if a heart's matters are pure & honest
[31:19] then an impossible thing becomes possible
[31:23] why are you being so happy, mom?
[31:26] if a ruddy goose gets wings, then its loses its ability to fly
[31:34] I wish that uncle would have asked about my breath then I would have given it very happily
[31:38] but he...
[31:41] Khursheed
[31:43] brother Mehr is giving you his breaths
[31:46] and you are complaining!
[31:48] these breaths will stuck in your son's throat, and then neither I will stay among alive nor dead people
[31:53] God forbid!
[31:55] what are you saying?
[31:58] there is a lot of power in an elders prayers, and a lot of blessings in the obedience of younger people
[32:05] if God willing then Rutba will prove to be a very loving & nice life partner
[32:14] you used to appease me in the same manner in my childhood, right?
[32:18] you used to say that my father has gone to God to get toys for me
[32:23] and one day he will come back with a lot of gifts
[32:27] mom, the life passes
[32:30] but these thoughts get stuck in one's mind like a desire
[32:37] I still see a dream that my father has brought so many toys
[32:43] but then I wake up
[32:51] mom, please don't console me anymore
[32:58] whatever my heart will experience, I will face it truly
[33:06] and now I don't even want to see a dream about this matter

[36:38] Ameen
[36:40] let me go & check the arrangements as we cannot rely on the servants
[36:45] everything happened so quickly that I couldn't think of anything. I'm coming in a while
[36:49] sister, the matter is not about hurry. The actual matter is happiness
[36:53] and it seems good if we get happiness in a hurry as well
[36:57] yes
[36:57] ok tell me one thing very honestly
[37:01] are you happy by making Azka your daughter-in-law?
[37:05] yes, I am very happy
[37:07] you'll see, I will make such an extravagant arrangements on her departure ceremony that the entire world will see
[37:13] I'm coming in a while
[37:41] I will see you later uncle
[37:44] the way you are playing this game so cleverly, the same way my defeat will become your fate one day
[37:52] by doing this act, don't think that you'll save your properties as well as your daughter
[37:58] this Saeedpur land is just a token money
[38:13] Altamash!
[38:17] the photo session is going on outside
[38:19] all the guests are sitting, so why you came here alone?
[38:24] Azka, whatever is happening right now I am not prepared for it mentally
[38:29] so please don't complain about anything
[38:33] if I ask for some space, so please take care of my feeling
[38:50] Sure
[38:54] who else would care about your feelings more than me?
[39:00] I know that you love Rutba but...
[39:04] still I have agreed to marry you
[39:08] do you know why?
[39:17] because I want to apply an ointment on your wounds as a friend
[39:23] do you know, my mother always say that the love of an honest woman makes a man forgets everything
[39:31] and the thing he forgets first is..
[39:35] the grief given by an unfaithful woman
[39:44] earlier I used to love you as a friend
[39:47] but now
[39:49] I will love you as a wife
[39:53] you'll see that you will forget everything
[39:58] thanks
[40:00] for taking care of my feelings
[40:04] now go outside, otherwise people will think inappropriate
[40:33] tomorrow evening is your wedding with Khursheed Hasan
[40:38] I hope that you will not disappoint me this time
[40:41] I have bowed down in front of your contumacy
[40:44] but if I will face disappointment this time
[40:47] now its your turn Rutba
try to test my choice too
[40:51] believe me, you will not be disappointed
[40:53] but still I am not forcing you
[40:56] if you heart doesn't agree, then you may refuse before the wedding

[41:29] Do you accept this marriage?
[41:31]  I accept
[41:32] Do you accept this marriage?
[41:35]  I accept

[41:44] for how many things I shall deny?
[41:48] you will accept someone else after rejecting me
[41:53] is this your love?
