[00:14] you are so nice, Altamash
[00:17]  this personality, these speaking eyes
[00:21] Rutba never deserved you 
[00:24] she has always considered you as a part of some wealth, or land
[00:32] disappointment & hopelessness binds a person with darkness
[00:42] dad, a raindrop affects on the soft sand
[00:47] I have become stone hearted 
[00:51] and stones doesn't get affected by anything
[01:06] are you happy now, dad? 
[01:08] you wanted this, right?
[01:10] that Altamash & I shall never be together 
[01:14] your lands, wealth, properties, daughter... your every precious thing shall stay with you
[01:27] safe inside your lockers and nobody shall make a demand from you about them
[01:32] dad, whatever you wanted has been done but now...
[01:35] but now...
[01:37] anyone's consolation... false hopes
I don't need anyone's false hopes, or false love at all
[01:57] brother
[02:17] may God keep you smiling this way, brother
[02:21] it seems to me that from every door Sajida is smiling
[02:28] you are right, Rasheeda

[02:36] Mr. Khan, the religious clerk is here
[02:39] make him sit inside with respect
[02:42] Okay

[02:51] brother, have you talked to Rutba properly?
[02:59] Rasheeda, don't give importance to Rutba's attitude
[03:08] since she had fallen from a sinking ship, so it will take some time for her
[03:15] and then a person who had fallen from the ship cannot deny the importance of a boat
[03:22] there won't be any refusal from Rutba's side as well
[04:57] please start

[11:40] Khursheed

[11:47] you seem very happy to me
[11:49] maybe uncle is also happy
[11:52] and what else is more important for me than the happiness of both of you
[12:00] are you ready to leave, Khursheed?
[12:02] yes uncle, I am leaving in a while. Its almost 3 to 4 hours journey, so I will reach Hasanabad till evening
[12:09] have a safe journey, may God keep you in his protection
[12:13] Amen
[12:15] come with me, I have some work
[12:17] Ok
[12:35] oh God!
[12:39] is this brother Mehr's standard now?
[12:42] this is called the final nail in the coffin
[12:46] he has pushed his daughter in the well
[12:48] yes sister, I am amazed!
[12:54] aunt, if Altamash is inside his room then can I go & meet him?
[12:59] hey, why do you need to seek permission now? Go
[13:04] here he comes
[13:06] Greetings aunt!
[13:07] greetings my dear, stay blessed
[13:13] these sweets are in what joy?
[13:19] these sweetmeats are of Rutba's wedding
[13:22] Rutba got married
[13:25] with whom?
[13:28] with Khursheed
[13:57] thank you, Rutba
[13:59] thank you so much
[14:01] by marrying Khursheed, you have proved that you are still mine
[14:30] uncle, what is this?
[14:31] its a blessed gift for a son from his father, for your new job, future & a beginning of a new life
[14:42] uncle, its a lot. I won't look good in it
[14:46] Khursheed, think about your wife
[14:50] will she travel in the buses, wagons or on your motorcycle?
[14:55] Rasheeda, I haven't given this gift to Khursheed in order to take out my daughter from the problems
[15:02] don't think this way
[15:04] its mine & Khursheed's matter
[15:07] not of a father-in-law or a son-in-law, instead of a father & a son
[15:11] Khursheed, you will leave today & after your departure that quarter will be closed for life time
[15:17] that little house will stay as an example of Rasheeda's honesty & obedience
[15:25] I will do Rutba's weddign with pageantry
[15:29] but before going, you shall meet your wife once
[16:13] Rutba
[16:17] Khursheed came to meet you
[16:34] before Khursheed's departure
[16:37] you people should have talked for a while
[16:43] say it, what do you want to say?
[16:49] I just wanted to say that the relation which is formed between the two of us
[16:54] may God gives us courage to maintain this relation
[16:58] as the happiness of our elders are associated with it
[17:03] you have said it right
[17:06] everyone's happiness & benefits are associated with this relation
[17:13] except me
[17:17] what do you think?
[17:19] that I will agree to marry an ordinary person like you
[17:28] I will choose you as my life partner
[17:30] Rutba
[17:31] I have just chosen you as my coffin
[17:36] you also listen to me, dad
[17:38] you really wanted to see your daughter's corpse hanging on your decision's gallows
[17:44] its fine then
[17:46] now you will not see your daughter but a corpse
[17:51] and he! He will remember this day for life time
[17:57] that he had agreed to marry a corpse
[18:04] uncle
[18:06] I'm coming after talking to Rutba, you may go
[18:23] I had only one benefit of making this relation
[18:26] that the way uncle had hold mine & my mother's hand in difficult times
[18:29] the same way, I shall become his support in his difficult times
[18:35] as far as emotions are concerned, then I don't have any expectations from you
[18:40] that's why it would be better for you to stay away from the misunderstandings
[18:45] I have a request
[18:48] don't try to fill the wounds given by Altamash by your father's tears
[18:54] God knows what is your intention behind this relation, but I will try my level best to maintain this relation
[19:01] you can test me whenever you want to
[19:08] Bye!
[19:55] Khursheed is going on the journey & I am feeling tired
[20:01] may God keep him safe with his motives
[20:06] may he reaches his destination safely
[20:09] then I will think that I have achieved the motive of my life
[20:14] brother, he is a young man
[20:17] also full of strength & courage
[20:20] the passion is attached with his journey
[20:24] the destination is not far from him
[20:27] don't tire yourself, just think good for him
[20:33] thank you Rasheeda
[20:53] brother, I have done exactly whatever you had asked me to do 
[20:58] they weren't agreeing at all
[21:01] and Altamash 
[21:04] he was adamant. He was saying that he will ensure to bring Rutba to his house by any means
[21:29] you don't love my father at all
[21:31] its all a drama
[21:33] don't I understand?
[21:35] you want a share in my father's wealth, and you are waiting for it. That's why you wanted to marry me as well
[21:42] don't know what do you think of yourself!
[21:45] you have no comparison with my Altamash!
[21:48] even his servants are better than you!
[21:59] Mithu, what happened? You haven't eaten anything since morning. Come on, eat your food
[22:05] take it, please
[22:08] Azka, be quick we are getting very late
[22:11] will you eat something else? Eat this, please
[22:14] Azka
[22:17] yes mom, I'm here
[22:23] All praise to God, you are looking so pretty. May God preserve you from evil eye
[22:28] She is doing a lot of preparations in order to go near an evil eye
[22:32] Shut up! Keep your mouth shut until you don't learn how to speak
[22:37] Azka, I'm thinking about brother. Whether we shall go over there or not
[22:43] any situation can arise, for now its not less than dangerous to go over there
[22:47] mom, can there be anything more dangerous than us for Mehr Ali house?
[22:55] you are absolutely correct!
[22:57] the arrow has struck on such a perfect goal, that all the nearby idols are destroyed
[23:02] now just melt down Altamash, then everything will become very easy
[23:07] don't you worry at all. You'll see, everything will happen as per our choice
[23:13] very good!
[23:15] I'm ready, shall we go?
[23:16] lets go!
[23:29] poor Rutba
[23:32] a person shouldn't be so naive & stupid
[24:42] yes come in
[24:43] Khursheed Hasan
[24:46] please come in Mr. Khursheed. I'm good, what about you?
[24:49] all thanks to God

[25:21] thank you!
[25:37] Greetings!*
[25:45] Ronaq sit, come Azka sit
[25:57] brother, I have done exactly whatever you had asked me to do
[26:01] they weren't agreeing at all
[26:05] and Altamash
[26:08] he was adamant. He was saying that he will ensure to bring Rutba to his house by any means
[26:18] brother, I didn't wanted to tell you but I thought...
[26:24] now Altamash is Azka's husband & your son-in-law, Ronaq
[26:29] yes brother, I can understand
[26:33] I thought to congratulate Rutba on her wedding
[26:39] congratulations to you too!
[26:41] uncle...
[26:44] can we also congratulate Rutba, if you allow us
[26:51] yes sure
[26:53] in fact, Rutba also wanted to congratulate you upon your wedding with Altamash
[27:00] I agree that she is quite stubborn, as she is my daughter
[27:06] but she isn't a narrow minded or a person who does conspiracies
[27:19] go meet her
[28:22] until I don't kiss your forehead in the morning
[28:26] until I don't wash your clothes with my hands
[28:29] and make tea for you, I am unable to spend my day
[28:34] don't worry mom
[28:36] soon I will bring you here
[28:42] I cannot live without you as well
[29:06] what do you think?
[29:08] that I will agree to marry an ordinary person like you
[29:14] I will choose you as my life partner
[29:16] I have just chosen you as my coffin
[30:17] greetings!
[30:20] greetings!
[30:28] who are you?
[30:31] my name is Khursheed Hasan
[30:36] and you?
[30:37] my name is Tazmeen Ansari, I teach Urdu Literature in Hasanabad College
[30:43] even I have joined it today, they have assigned me business subjects
[30:47] good to know
[30:50] this cottage was desolate since quiet a long time
[30:53] Since you came now, so it will become lively
[30:58] have you taken evening tea?
[31:01] I've just set my room in this cottage, but the kitchen is still empty
[31:07] I think I have to go to the canteen for the tea
[31:11] wait a minute please
[31:26] what is the need for all this? So much of formality!
[31:29] Its not a formality. We can do at least this much for our neighbors
[31:34] thank you!
[31:36] see you tomorrow in the college then
[31:39] sure
[32:11] Rasheeda, come on now say good bye to this small house
[32:15] brother...
[32:17] this place is so precious, maybe I cannot tell you in words
[32:23] I have spent so many peaceful years under its roof
[32:27] I had slept peacefully, also I woke up without any worries
[32:31] Rasheeda, it was own desire which I had honored
[32:35] I had never forced you or Khursheed for staying here
[32:40] now Rutba is Khursheed's wife
[32:44] the right Rutba has on this house, Khursheed has got more rights than her
[32:51] you are Khursheed's mother, my sister & Rutba's aunt
[32:58] the right you have on all of this, nobody else can have the same right
[33:02] you are not allowed to leave even if Khursheed says
[33:07] who will take care of the brother?
[33:10] may God bless you with my life as well, brother
[33:13] where can I go after leaving you?
[33:16] and then how will I face Sajida?
[33:19] and listen Rasheeda, there is no need to tire yourself in the presence of servants
[33:25] stay relaxed & peaceful, this house belongs to all of us
[33:30] lets go!
[34:39] Mr. Khursheed
[34:41] how are you doing?
[34:43] yes, I'm fine. You tell me
[34:45] I can only say that the college principal, staff & students.. everyone is impressed from you
[34:51] All praise to God. So you know how to impress people
[34:54] I haven't come here to impress people but to lift up my head
[34:59] with a motive & a passion
[35:02] I have heard that its the most difficult task to earn respect
[35:04] people do earn the money, but not respect
[35:08] and its not important that what are the people saying about me after my arrival over here
[35:11] I am worried about the fact that what will they say after my departure from here
[35:15] anyways, I shall take your leave now as the principal has called me
[35:19] Sure. Listen, the evening tea is from my side. Do remember
[35:24] Thank you!
[35:47] Okay, this is for you Fari
[35:50] thank you!
[35:51] this is for Arzo Khan, and this is for Farah
[35:54] everyone has to come, and that too on the time
[35:57] Azka, how did it happen?
[36:00] I mean, Altamash was crazy about Rutba right? then how come he had left her & got married to you?
[36:06] Altamash was always crazy about me
[36:09] he used to love me
[36:12] and Rutba came in between us on the basis of her wealth & properties
[36:17] but soon Altamash has realized his mistake
[36:21] and he has removed that ill-mannered girl from his life
[36:26] what are you saying?
[36:28] I'm saying the right thing
[36:31] but I think you people should visit Rutba
[36:36] after all, a friend should console a friend
[36:41] Altamash had left her but...
[36:44] Khursheed aka Sheeday was written in that poor girl's fate
[36:51] her fate is ruined
[36:58] anyways...
[37:05] mom, dad.. I had married Azka upon your orders. But still I have no interest in her
[37:10] why are you hurrying for departure ritual now? I won't be able to do it
[37:13] you have already experienced loss because of your anger, Altamash
[37:17] we have lost the well, now only a bucket is left
[37:23] a further mistake will deprive you from this as well
[37:27] your mother is absolutely correct, Altamash
[37:31] this is not the right time to ruin our relations with Ronaq & Azka
[37:37] Mehr Ali hasn't transferred the property on your name, but on Azka's name
[37:44] now Azka is the name of a golden sparrow
[37:50] and if that golden sparrow wants to come into your fist, then open your fist & let her come inside
[38:01] if you will lost this sparrow as well
[38:04] then you'll only regret for life time, that's it!
[38:12] if Ronaq & Azka wants to get the departure ritual done, then we'll get it done
[38:16] Rutba wouldn't have agreed to marry such an ordinary & a low class person like Khursheed for no reason
[38:23] she also have the same feelings in her heart that you have
[38:27] and you will see, soon she will part her ways from Khursheed
[38:32] and then, the ways for her to come back into your life will be opened
[38:40] Altamash, I know it very well
[38:43] that brother Mehr Ali has offered Saeedpur property in order to keep you distant from Rutba
[38:52] but now we'll take the property as well as Rutba from him
[39:00] there, Rutba will part her ways from Khursheed
[39:04] and here you will part your ways from Azka
[39:13] true that
