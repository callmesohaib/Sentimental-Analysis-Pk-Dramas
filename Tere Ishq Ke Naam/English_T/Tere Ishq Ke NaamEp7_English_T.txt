[00:14] only I have the right on my father's entire wealth. As I am his only daughter
[00:20] there is a lot of difference in taking your own right & to steal someone's right
[00:26] how cleverly you have got that land transferred in your name & nobody even got a hint
[00:31] She was looking so pretty, right?
[00:35] her beauty & her eyes are stuck on my mind
[00:40] there was love, expressions & desires in her eyes 
[00:44] she wanted to say a lot, also she wanted to hear so many things
[00:57] brother, our Rutba is so naive & innocent
[01:00] those people have provoked her, otherwise she can never take such a big step without your permission
[01:08] Rasheeda, those feet who slips & fell in the river
[01:13] if they blame the river, then its injustice
[01:17] if the sand slips under one's feet
[01:22] then no matter how strong a person is, still he staggers
[01:27] I don't consider anyone reprehensible, except for my daughter
[01:32] I had loved Rutba unconditionally
[01:37] I had saved her from the harsh weather
[01:40] I had spent my entire life in her worries but...
[01:45] She didn't even think that...
[01:49] how her father must be feeling
[01:54] she doesn't give me any importance
[02:00] No Rasheeda
[02:03] I cannot forgive her
[02:05] will you disinherit her from her rightful share?
[02:11] what answer will you give to God?
[02:13] I won't disinherit her from my wealth
[02:16] but I will pretend this
[02:21] because I want to see the real faces of some people
[02:27] also, I want to show them to Rutba as well
[02:35] I have informed the close relatives
[02:38] I have invited all
[02:40] On Thursday evening there will be lighting in this house but...
[02:44] nobody will be aware of my heart's condition
[02:48] this burner will not lit
[02:52] but there will be only smoke
[02:55] but yes, it will decorate each & every corner of this house
[03:00] so that Rutba can realize that her father is stern on his rules & regulations but
[03:06] he is not afraid
[04:17] I had misbehaved a lot with you
[04:21] I had said a lot of things in anger
[04:26] I'm really sorry for hurting you
[04:31] I understand you very well, Rutba
[04:35] you always bow down for your motive
[04:40] the girl who didn't care about her most loving father's heart, then how will she care about my worn out heart
[04:48] tell me
[04:50] what work do you have?
[04:55] make me speak to Altamash, please
[05:04] Okay
[05:06] I will
[05:10] but I have a condition
[05:15] say it
[05:18] you may talk about whatever you want to, but do it in front of me
[05:22] won't you feel ashamed to hear the personal talks of a husband & a wife?
[05:26] I keep my brain & ears closed for useless discussions
[05:30] I only understand those things which are for my knowledge
[05:41] Fine! dial Altamash's number for me. I will talk to him in front of you
[05:48] if you are so shameless, then let it be
[06:05] aunty, are you sure that the lands documents & registry are inside the mansion?
[06:08] yes my dear, the manager Nisar had told me this thing and...
[06:13] I had been there with brother so many times
[06:17] not only the documents of wealth & properties are present there. In fact sister Sajida's jewelry is also saved there
[06:22] only that jewelry worth millions of rupees
[06:28] now I will tell uncle that what is his son-in-law's worth!
[06:32] he was thinking that he did a cheap trade
[06:39] how dare you to call me!
[06:41] Altamash, this is me not khursheed
[06:43] Rutba... I'm sorry, I didn't know that its you
[06:53] but why are you calling from Khursheed's number?
[06:57] has uncle taken the phone from you again?
[06:59] dad has gone to to city after leaving me in the mansion
[07:04] I know
[07:06] Rutba, I know... I am aware of everything
[07:10] uncle came here, he had threatened all of us
[07:14] the same thing happened about which we were scared
[07:16] I had told you that my father will never tolerate this marriage
[07:22] I am so scared, Altamash. Very much
[07:26] how will I be able to face my father?
[07:28] Rutba
[07:30] this is not the right time to face anyone or to be scared of anyone
[07:33] its the right time to talk while looking into the eyes of the other party
[07:37] do you know that uncle has disinherited you from his wealth & properties?
[07:40] what!
[07:42] No! my father cannot do this
[07:45] its true
[07:47] he has decided. And he can go to any extent to humiliate me
[07:52] he has announced his decision
[07:54] that he will depart you empty hands from Mehr Ali house
[07:57] No, I cannot believe it. My father cannot disinherit me
[08:04] we have been ruined because of this belief
[08:06] but you know, uncle had taught us that everything is fair in love & war
[08:12] So let it be, we'll ensure to show uncle how to win this battle
[08:16] Rutba, listen to me very carefully
[08:19] and you have to act upon my each & every word
[08:34] documents!
[08:38] they are not only documents
[08:40] there is jewelry as well, your mother's jewelry
[08:43] and you've got complete right on them. Rutba, your mother must have kept them for you, right?
[08:50] by any means, you have to bring that jewelry to your room from your father's room
[08:55] are you listening to me?
[08:58] the key of uncle's room is in his manager Nisar's room
[09:02] you have to get that key by any means
[09:05] at night, bring all the things from his safe to your room
[09:09] uncle will not have the time to visit the mansion
[09:12] he will be busy in the wedding
[09:14] until wedding he will not get to know about this incident
[09:18] and you can bring all those things with that stupid guy Khursheed
[09:29] are you listening?
[09:31] yes, I am
[09:36] Rutba, if once we get these documents
[09:39] then uncle cannot harm us at all
[09:42] he has to accept his defeat
[09:50] Ok Altamash, I am hanging up
[09:53] bye!
[10:28] brother, your medicine
[10:31] thank you, Rasheeda
[10:35] may God keep you happy
[10:37] you are an umbrageous tree
[10:40] may your branches always stay green & lively
[10:44] may God keep you healthy, brother. 
Please do take care of your health
[10:51] right now, Rutba is very young
[10:53] don't take her mistakes to your heart
[10:57] these kids are the reason of liveliness in the house
[11:00] if they leave, then this place becomes deserted
[11:05] I know, Rasheeda
[11:08] but... a heart has his own demands
[11:13] to whom it loves unconditionally
[11:19] it keeps high hopes & expectations from them
[11:23] if expectations aren't fulfilled then it withers like that plant
[11:28] to which attention is not given
[11:32] you are a mother
[11:34] a father is a very sensitive & egoistic person
[11:40] he needs fondness... 
[11:42] Compliance and.. 
[11:45] generosity
[11:48] a mother is a selfless person who is always busy in her motherhood
[11:54] A father becomes very stone hearted & difficult person for his heart
[12:03] anyways, let it be
[12:06] I am worrying you uselessly
[12:09] go, take some rest
[12:11] may God always keep your sleep peaceful & satisfied
[12:18] may you be blessed with your child's happiness
[12:21] thank you!
[12:23] your medicine
[12:30] Rasheeda
Rasheeda, quickly bring me the juice
[12:38] how scandalous!
[12:40] Azka, my sugar level is getting low
[12:45] we have to do something, Azka
[12:48] if Altamash & sister Sanober became successful in their motive, then everything will be destroyed
[12:56] Go
[12:59] even brother won't be able to do anything
[13:02] that Bazil Khan! he will sit like a snake on my brother's wealth
[13:06] and eventually we'll lose Altamash as well
[13:10] No mom, I don't want to lose Altamash at any cost
[13:14] I want his companionship
[13:16] but he is of Rutba now, at least forget him now
[13:20] the dreams doesn't stop chasing a person until there is strength in one's eyes
[13:25] how can she forget Altamash?
[13:27] and don't talk against your sister at all times. Go inside your room & study
[13:39] mom, what uncle did to you?
[13:44] I don't burn my fingers by digging the ash from the past, Azka
[13:48] don't ask this question next time
[13:50] I have decided to make everyone jealous
[13:54] brother couldn't see his sister's happiness, right?
[13:57] now he won't see his daughter's happiness as well
[14:01] his eyes will stay deprived of it
[14:07] call on brother's number
[14:11] what are you about to do?
[14:13] do you know, if Altamash or aunt Sanober got a hint about this matter
[14:18] then the doors of that house will be closed on us for life time
[14:20] the doors will be closed, but not on us but on Rutba
[14:28] call on his number, didn't you hear me?
[14:42] yes Ronaq, is everything fine?
[14:44] brother, nothing is fine
[14:46] say ti Ronaq, I am listening
[14:49] I heard Altamash talking to Rutba in front of me
[14:53] its impossible!
[14:55] Rutba & Altamash cannot contact each other
[14:57] brother, this young age is like a rough river
[15:00] and who comes in front of a river?
[15:03] tell me further, Ronaq
[15:05] our nephew has given such a big responsibility to Rutba
[15:08] to take out all the lands documents & sister Sajida's jewelry from your locker tonight
[15:16] the daughter isn't accepting the punishment given by her father
[15:19] and the son-in-law is not ready to lose his father-in-law's wealth & properties
[15:23] they are doing a lot of Rutba's brainwashing
[15:25] I heard everything from my ears
[15:28] I must say brother, the time has come that "One knockout is better than hundred punches"
[15:33] strike them so hardly that everyone recalls their ability
[15:37] cut down Rutba's wings & clear Altamash's issues too
[15:43] this is the only chance for you to save your daughter from these conspiracy minded people
[15:48] otherwise, you'll regret for life time
[15:51] hmm... thank you Ronaq, I am thankful to you
[15:55] I am helpless, since I cannot fight with my only sister that's why I want you to keep it a secret
[16:01] I hope that you will keep my honor
[16:04] don't worry
[16:06] thank you, brother
[16:28] now we'll enjoy!
[16:30] uncle will not leave Rutba
[16:33] do you know
[16:35] I was thinking that he shall shot her once & for all in his anger
[16:39] so that this matter should end
[16:44] Azka, I know you are jealous of Rutba since our childhood
[16:49] from her clothes, toys & books
[16:53] from uncle's unconditional love & then Altamash's love
[16:56] you are jealous of Rutba about everything
[16:59] one should not go so far in anyone's hatred, that its difficult o find our way back
[17:04] listen to me! keep your lectures to yourself
[17:07] I don't need them at all
[17:10] I know it very well that whom I have to be in love with in my life
[17:15] and with whom I have to do hatred
[17:22] and then, I will do the same thing with my hatred's love that
[17:29] people do with an injured lion
[17:54] don't know since when I have been seeing this dream that Rutba Mehr Ali will be of Altamash
[18:00] also Mehr Ali's entire wealth & bank balance will be in my hands
[18:04] very good Rutba
[18:07] you can do this work & you have to do it
[18:27] this is not the right time to face anyone or to be scared of anyone
[18:30] its the right time to talk while looking into the eyes of the other party 
[18:32] do you know that uncle has disinherited you from his wealth & properties?
[18:36] he has decided. And he can go to any extent to humiliate me
[18:40] he will depart you empty hands from Mehr Ali house
[18:44] there are a few documents in the mansion, you have to keep them with you
[18:48] there is jewelry as well, your mother's jewelry and you've got complete right on them. 
[18:53] Rutba, your mother must have kept them for you, right?
[18:55] by any means, you have to bring that jewelry to your room from your father's room
[18:59]  bring all the things from his safe to your room
[19:02] Rutba, if once we get these documents then uncle cannot harm us at all
[19:06] he has to accept his defeat
[21:35] I wanted to feel her fragrance
[21:42] now I've seen it 
[21:46] so it feels as if
[21:52] I have cried on my mother's shoulders
[21:59] I have felt her fragrance
[22:42] mom
[23:25] why did you leave me?
[23:32] why did you leave me, mom?
[23:37] why have you left me alone in this world?
[23:51] why did you leave me alone?
[23:58] dad..
[24:00] how can dad understand my feelings?
[24:06] only a mother can understand her daughter's feelings
[24:17] today, if you had been here
[24:22] then why this would have happened with me?
[24:26] it wouldn't have happened with me
[25:55] forgive me, dad
[26:00] I came inside your room without your permission
[26:08] but... before leaving
[26:14] just once
[26:19] one last time
[26:23] I wanted to see my mother's necklace & her bangles
[26:35] I wanted to feel her fragrance
[26:42] now I've seen it
[26:46] so it feels as if
[26:53] I have cried on my mother's shoulders
[27:00] I have felt her fragrance
[27:08] its fine if you don't want to give me this jewelry
[27:20] but I am taking her fragrance with me
[28:32] uncle has called
[28:35] after breakfast, we will leave for Karachi
[28:40] Ok
[28:42] have you kept the luggage?
[28:49] which luggage?
[28:52] I had came empty hands
[28:54] so I will leave empty hands
[28:59] but yes, you may check
[29:02] if you want anything, then take it for sure
[29:08] my dad will not refuse you
[29:12] after all, he loves you more than his own child
[29:20] this morning is so beautiful, Rutba
[29:25] your taunts will not make any difference to me
[29:30] come outside after doing the breakfast, I am waiting for you in the car
[30:38] you are Mehr Ali Khan's only child
[30:44] feel proud on your good luck, Rutba
[30:50] your thinking cannot reach to that level where your father is standing
[31:43] Greetings dad!
[31:51] dad, all this...
[31:57] these are the tears
[32:00] which I cannot hide, even if I want to
[32:03] there is a lot going on in my heart but..
[32:07] even after all of this, I want that
[32:10] the honor of relation shall stay intact
[32:14] because...
[32:16] the responsibility nature gives to a father
[32:20] in that, the last responsibility is to take care of the honor of a relation
[32:27] its burden on a father's shoulders
[32:34] is more heavier than his daughter's dead body
[32:41] and if his daughter is rebellious
[32:46] then his heart need to bear this burden
[32:55] go Rutba
[32:58] do the preparations for leaving from here
[33:02] there is no need to say good bye
[33:04] because..
[33:07] you have already departed from my heart
[34:06] uncle
[34:08] yes Khursheed
[34:12] these are the invitation cards
[34:15] by the way, we have informed everyone on the phone but...
[34:19] we have to fulfill these worldly traditions too
[34:23] everyone should get these cards by today
[34:25] yes yes, God willing it will be done
[34:32] actually I wanted to say something important to you
[34:39] not right now dear, I don't want to hear anything
[34:44] go & check on the arrangements
[34:48] the time is really short, so go!
[34:50] but uncle, the matter I want to discuss with you is very important for you to know
[34:56] Khursheed, maybe you haven't heard me properly
[35:01] I don't want to hear anything right now
[35:05] go
[35:06] ok
[35:15] our nephew has given such a big responsibility to Rutba
[35:19] to take out all the lands documents & sister Sajida's jewelry from your locker tonight
[35:24] the daughter isn't accepting the punishment given by her father 
[35:27] and the son-in-law is not ready to lose his father-in-law's wealth & properties
[35:31] they are doing a lot of Rutba's brainwashing
[35:33] this is the only chance for you to save your daughter from these conspiracy minded people 
[35:36] otherwise, you'll regret for life time
[36:10] what happen, Rutba?
[36:14] aunty, what as such I have done that...
[36:16] dad doesn't want to talk to me, nor he wants to look at me
[36:22] he doesn't want to give me a hug
[36:25] nor he wants to put his hand on my head for giving blessings
[36:29] am I so bad?
[36:33] no dear
[36:35] brotheer Mehr loves you a lot, he had kept you very preciously
[36:41] and after Sajida's demise he lives after seeing you only
[36:51] No
[36:54] I have broken my father's heart
[36:58] by marrying Altamash
[37:01] without his permission and consent
[37:06] I have broken my father's heart
[37:10] I have broken my father's heart, right aunty?
[37:14] he could have tolerated that
[37:17] his heart broke
[37:19] but you have broken his honor
[37:25] a father's honor is way too sensitive than a mother's motherhood
[37:31] if an honor breaks
[37:33] then a father breaks as well
[37:36] and one should not keep any hope from a broken person
[37:41] because he is gathering himself
[37:46] I am going from this house empty hands
[37:50] if he can put his hand on my head to bless me with his blessings
[37:55] and would have departed me with a smile
[38:00] aunty, I have got no complains from empty hands
[38:06] but from my fate
[38:09] which doesn't have a father's blessings anymore
[38:13] its a father & a daughter relationship
[38:17] if an ego & stubbornness comes between it
[38:21] then nothing is left behind
[38:24] neither any complain or anything else
[38:41] only the spark of the relation is left
[38:46] and God willing you will see that
[38:49] these are the days for you to smile
[38:52] just smile..
