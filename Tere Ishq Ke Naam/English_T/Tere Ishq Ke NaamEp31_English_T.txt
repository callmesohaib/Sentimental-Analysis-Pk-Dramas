[00:14] I came to you to offer my condolences when uncle passed away.
[00:22] But now I think I'll have to offer my condolences to uncle.
[00:27] I'll have to tell him that...
[00:36] he is alive and Rutba Mehar Ali is dead.
[00:59] He didn't stop himself from coming near you...
[01:03] the truth is that you never let him touch you.
[01:12] You think that you belonged to Altamash...
[01:18] and you will always belong to Altamash.
[01:27] Khursheed.
[01:59] I'm ashamed in front of you uncle.
[02:07] I couldn't fulfill any promise that I made you.
[02:16] I couldn't become like you.
[02:28] I don't know how you maintained relationships with these cruel and careless people.
[02:40] I can't even maintain a relationship with someone that I love
[02:51] Keeping my ego and self-respect in mind...
[02:58] I would like to ask for your forgiveness, uncle.
[03:04] If Rutbah had fed me poison out of love...
[03:10] I would have happily consumed it.
[03:18] But I cannot be betrayed within the boundaries of love.
[03:27] I can't stand to be betrayed.
[03:34] Please forgive me.
[04:23] Aska... don't turn yourself away from food like this.
[04:28] All your life I kept explaining to you one thing...
[04:32] One should never convert a win into a loss, but you never seem to understand that.
[04:39] Aska... hate's intense fire is a good thing...
[04:44] granted that one burns the person they hate.
[04:48] Not oneself. 
What's the point if one burns oneself?
[04:55] Not eating and drinking will only harm you and your child. It will not do anything to anyone.
[05:02] If you lose everything trying to gain everything, then I spit at such intentions.
[05:24] Good girl... first you were competing with Rutbah...
[05:30] but now you are competing with Altamash and his parents.
[05:34] Never forget that you have the biggest weapon and that is your unborn child.
[05:44] I have a lot of things on my hands, which will drive Altamash crazy.
[06:07] So you had to come.
[06:22] What happened? Didn't you go to Rutbah to beg her to love you?
[06:28] Didn't you go there to take her inheritance, but before that to offer her your inheritance?
[06:43] Altamash what's gotten into you? What don't you have?
[06:51] You have a loving wife.
[06:55] And I have your successor who will have your entire inheritance.
[07:00] But I don't know why you still have to run behind Rutbah.
[07:06] Rutbah is asking for a price in return for your love.
[07:11] Shut up your nonsense.
[07:16] Lies and plot schemes...
[07:21] that is all that you know how to do.
[07:25] You don't love me... all of this is an act.
[07:31] I hate this act of love.
[07:35] Aska...
[07:37] hand me over the papers, otherwise, none will be worse than me.
[07:50] Your threats do not affect me.
[07:54] I will make you yearn for those papers...
[07:58] and for your child.
[08:03] Before you make Rutbah your second wife you'll have to walk over my dead body.
[08:11] Otherwise, I will...
Altamash
[08:17] I have tolerated enough... how dare you raise a hand on my daughter in front of me?
[08:23] Have you no shame? I have raised you.
[08:27] I have supported your parents all my life.
[08:31] And you... and this is how you return my favors...
I want to listen to this as well...
[08:38] What favors are you talking about? 
I want to hear about them as well.
[08:43] Remember, no matter how many masks one puts on, one day their true face is always revealed.
[08:50] Your daughter was caught stealing in her own home.
[08:56] A thief is a thief, no matter how much you respect them. 
[08:58] You two were not worthy of the respect we gave you.
[09:03] What respect could you give me? 
[09:06] You stole my youth, honor, and happiness from me! 
[09:11] All our childhood you turned father and brother against me.
[09:15] He always supported you and was against me. I lived in our home like a prisoner.
[09:20] And all of this is because of you.
[09:23] You've been like this from when you were a child...
[09:26] You've been blaming your shortcomings on others since you were a child.
[09:31] Because of you and your daughter, we had to go through a bad period. 
[09:34] Otherwise, Altamash and Rutbah would have been together.
[09:38] You and your daughter will be left behind empty-handed.
[09:43] Where are the papers... hand them over to me.
[09:48] Aska... Aska...
[09:54] Aska...
[10:19] Paida... your grandson didn't come to the madrassa today...
[10:23] Has he had enough of studying?
 You will grab him by the ear and leave him here.
[10:29] Don't worry Rasheeda, I will drop him off tomorrow.
[10:34] Look... children and children, it's our duty as their elders to make them understand.
[10:41] We need to make them understand that education is important and without it we are nothing.
[10:46] One can't have success without it... make sure you leave him here tomorrow.
[11:00] The tea is getting cold.
[12:32] Did you see the scene the two of them put on?
[12:36] I've had enough of this.
[12:39] Don't worry, I'll resolve all these matters today.
[12:43] I don't need a girl like that in my life.
Aska, what are you doing?
[12:48] What's wrong with you?
[12:52] Leave me...
Stop me... I'll burn everything. What does he think of me?
[12:58] What is going on Altamash?
[14:44] Khursheed.
[14:48] Greetings mother
[14:51] When did you get back?
[15:32] Where are you coming from?
[15:35] From the graveyard.
[15:39] After I was done burying, I came here.
[15:44] Who did you bury?
[15:52] I met my uncle.
[15:56] I'm very sad.
[16:00] Don't ask me any more questions, otherwise, I'll start crying and I won't be able to stop.
[16:07] I will not ask anything.
[16:10] Did you eat?
[16:32] I'm tired mother...
[16:39] I just want to leave all the sadness and pain behind.
[16:46] I want to lie down on your lap and sleep.
[16:54] It will be the same blue sky...
[16:59] that I wanted to touch when I was a child.
[17:07] Apart from that, there will be no one's presence...
[17:11] and no one's thought.
[17:57] What?
[17:59] May God forgive their sins.
[18:03] Alright.
[18:06] What happened?
Rutbah's aunt has died.
[18:11] She was caught in a fire.
[18:33] Does one not give a chance to explain before complaining?
[18:38] Enough Rutbah...
[18:41] All the doors between have closed forever.
[18:49] I don't need any explanation from you.
[18:53] I don't have any complaints against you.
[18:57] I have complaints against my heart.
[19:10] Khursheed...
[19:13] Give me a chance to say something.
[19:20] Dead people can't speak.
[19:32] You will get your last possession.
[19:38] Be happy.
[19:50] On your say-so, I've burned all ships.
[19:55] There is no margin for you to go back...
[19:59] or for me.
[20:38] Greetings auntie.
[20:44] What?
[21:47] Auntie...
[21:51] Rutbah...
[22:03] How did this happen, auntie?
[22:08] It was the fire inside her that came outside and ate away at her.
[22:14] She's asking for everyone's forgiveness.
[22:20] That is the line between forgiveness and lies.
[22:27] Forgive her as well.
[22:30] Forgive her... maybe that will lessen her pain.
[23:49] Auntie...
[24:05] Aska burned me.
[24:27] Forgive me Rutbah, I was wrong.
[24:34] Forgive me.
[24:43] Auntie, I forgive you.
[24:53] May God forgive you as well.
[25:50] The doctors are saying that it's hard for her to survive.
[25:57] Seventy percent of her body has been burned.
[26:03] All her life she ran behind inheritance and her child.
[26:07] She kept burning herself in revenge.
[26:10] That child and inheritance destroyed her.
[26:23] How's Aska?
[26:26] She was saved.
[26:29] But the doctors are saying...
[26:32] it's hard for the child to survive.
[26:35] Altamash is in the ICU.
[26:40] No one is allowed to go in there.
[26:46] And I...
[26:50] I am here praying that my daughter-in-law and her child survive.
[26:55] And I'm praying that my sister finds ease.
[27:02] You should pray as well.
[27:06] Pray...
[28:04] Here you are, tea.
[28:12] Did you meet Rutbah?
[28:18] I did.
[28:21] I talked to her about a few things and came to you.
[28:24] Khursheed, haven't you changed?
[28:29] Who is that friend of yours? Tasmeem...
[28:34] Are you distancing yourself from Rutbah because of her?
[28:38] Listen to me with open ears, if you do something like that...
Mother, please...
[28:45] I'm going outside for a while. I'll meet my friends and walk in the fields...
[28:50] I don't have much time, I have a flight day after tomorrow.
[28:54] What?
[28:57] So soon? Khursheed, what's the point of you coming here?
[29:02] I told you that I came here to only meet my uncle.
[29:07] I wasn't getting permission to come here. It was hard for me to get permission.
[29:13] But you didn't answer me.
[29:19] What?
The one about Tasneem.
[29:25] For God's sake let my life be mine.
[29:32] I'm leaving, I'll be back in the evening.
It's Rutbah calling.
[29:41] Hello... how are you, my dear?
[29:45] Yes, I'm fine...
[29:48] What?
[29:50] May God forgive her sins. Alright.
[29:57] What happened?
Rutbah's aunt has passed away.
[30:02] The poor woman was caught in a fire...
[30:08] From God we come and to Him we shall return.
[30:11] I will return to the city with you tomorrow.
[30:16] Alright.
[30:51] Aska! What are you doing? Have you gone insane?
[30:57] Let go of me... I'll burn everything. What does Altamash think of himself?
[31:01] Aska, have you gone insane?
[35:21] I don't want to talk to Aska or even look at her.
[35:28] Don't think like that. No matter what happens, she's your sister.
[35:40] You have a relationship with her that will never end.
[35:46] In such relationships, one needs to forget the mistakes that were made.
[35:51] One should have a big heart.
[35:55] A person can be sad all their life...
[35:59] but can never be happy all their life.
[36:03] Rutbah is right.
[36:06] That is the truth that Ronaq could never understand in her life.
[36:13] If she had... then she would not have spent a life like that.
[36:18] Mother could not understand.
[36:22] Aska will not understand as well.
[36:26] She's among the people who spend their entire lives holding onto lies.
[36:34] I spoke the truth...
[36:40] and she broke all ties with me.
[36:43] She didn't meet me when I got married.
[36:47] She didn't meet me when I left abroad, why should I meet her?
[36:55] She's responsible for my mother's death.
[36:59] She's responsible for the death of her child.
[37:06] Why would she need someone's sympathy now?
[37:10] She's right.
[37:15] One should sympathize with who is worthy of it. 
[37:18] There is no point in sympathizing with a murderer.
[37:22] I'm telling you guys, I will divorce Aska forty days have passed after Auntie's death.
