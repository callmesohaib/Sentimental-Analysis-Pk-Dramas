[00:14] only mine & Altamash's union is important 
[00:18] see... all of this is so pretty & beautiful
[00:24]  but still incomplete
[00:33] you cannot do this, Altamash
[00:38] Rutba, I divorce you!
[00:44] I divorce you! I divorce you!
[01:01] Rutba... 
Rutba
[01:04] open your eyes Rutba
[01:15] Rutba
[01:17] Khursheed!
[01:19] bring the car
[01:26] bring some water
[01:30]  Rutba... Rutba
[01:44] mom
[01:47] thank you! 
[01:50] thank you so much! calm down
[03:14] Mr. Mehr
[03:18] doctor, isn't there any danger? Will my daughter be fine?
[03:22] it will be appropriate for us to say anything once she gains conscious
[03:25] for now we'll keep her in the intensive care, just pray that God makes things easier
[03:36] what had happened, Khursheed?
[03:39] how did this happen?
[03:41] I hadn't thought about it
[03:45] I had lost my contumacy & ego in front of Rutba's happiness
[03:58] then how come this had happened?
[04:01] uncle, maybe Altamash got very angry upon not bringing the properties documents & jewelry
[04:10] what are you saying?
[04:12] I had tried to tell you about it so many times
[04:15] Rutba hadn't brought anything along with her from the farmhouse, she had locked the locker as it is
[04:24] oh Khursheed, what have you done!
[04:30] please sit
[04:35] wretched man!
[04:41] that wretched man should have asked me once, or should have told me 
[04:48] I would have given him everything for the sake of my daughter's happiness
[04:59] everything will be fine, uncle
[05:02] don't worry
[05:26] what had happened?
[05:29] what had happened with us!
[05:31] my brain is completely numb
[05:34] what is this darkness, sister?
[05:37] We had gone so happily to get our Altamash's bride
[05:45] brother has humiliated us a lot
[05:51] what brother Mehr Ali has done!
[05:54] he has ruined all of us along with him
[06:00] Altamash, take a deep breath
[06:02] quiet!
[06:08] quiet
[06:11] I don't need anyone's sympathies
[06:17] I won't spare uncle!
[06:21] I will ensure to take the revenge of this insult from him
[07:18] I am thinking... 
[07:21] what will happen to Rutba now?
[07:27] this selfish & greedy person has changed her life
[07:35] she will not be the same Rutba anymore
[07:43] I feel like killing him!
[07:51] I wish that boy wasn't my nephew
[07:56] do';t worry, uncle
[08:00] whatever God do is for the betterment
[08:04] I'm with you
[08:42] Altamash, what are you doing? Have you gone mad!
[08:44] yes, I have become crazy!
[08:46] what is this... 
[08:49] what have you done? Azka, go & bring first aid box
[08:53] mom see, what I have done
[08:58] what have I done!
[09:00] I will go mad. I have distant Rutba from myself
[09:04] no dear, nothing will happen. We are with you, everything will be fine
[09:08] nothing will be fine
[09:12] nothing will be fine
[09:17] my anger has finished everything by distancing Rutba from me
[09:24] do the band aid
[09:27] Azka, quickly do the band aid
[09:29] and see, not a single inch of glass should be left. Otherwise it will not heal
[09:32] mom, don't worry. The wound will heal completely
[09:37] it won't leave any visible sign
[09:40] what is the madness!
[09:43] sister come with me, lets send the maid so that she can clean it
[09:47] please come
how can I leave him like this?
[09:49] Azka is here, she is looking after him. Please come
[09:52] brother Bazil, please come lets discuss about it
[10:00] Altamash, gather yourself!
[10:04] everything happened because of Rutba
[10:07] even today she gave importance to her father's words upon yours
[10:11] she didn't trusted you
[10:14] if she would have trusted, then she would have brought the jewelry & documents
[10:17] what's the big deal in it?
[10:20] I agree that you did a mistake emotionally
[10:23] but it happens in anger
[10:26] if anyone else would have been there in your place
[10:30] then he would have made the same decision
[10:33] I have lost Rutba
[10:38] how will I live?
[10:40] I don't understand
[10:43] the more you will think about her, the more you will get hurt
[10:48] let me bring the medicine for you
[10:51] rest for a while
[10:53] I won't get any rest
[10:59] her face is in my eyes
[11:06] not on Rutba
[11:08] but try to focus on the wealth that you have lost
[11:12] and that too just because of Rutba's stupidity
[11:17] if you have to mourn then mourn over it
[11:24] Rutba had made you suffered with great loss & you are still taking her name
[11:32] try not to remember her
[11:36] but to forget her
[11:42] keep your suggestion with yourself!
[12:25] Altamash
[12:28] Rutba
[12:29] Altamash
[12:31] Altamash, you cannot leave me
[12:34] Rutba, are you fine?
[12:37] Altamash... you cannot leave me like this
[12:41] let me call the doctor
[12:45] Altamash, please don't leave me
[12:53] please don't leave me... please
[12:58] nurse, please check
[13:01] please Altamash
[13:04] are her vitals fine?
[13:06] please don't leave me
[13:09] please Altamash
[13:11] I had told you at night that her condition is really bad & she is in a lot of stress
[13:15] don't discuss any such thing in front of her that will give her more stress
[13:20] also, she needs a lot of care
[13:24] Altamash
[13:48] there won't be any benefit of making a long face & sitting idle
[13:53] both of you do the breakfast
[13:57] I am not liking anything at all, its difficult for me to take a morsel
[14:03] we have lost everything
[14:05] only sand is left in our hands
[14:07] I don't understand, whether to pour in on the head or to eat it?
[14:12] what needs to be done next?
[14:15] go to some religious scholar & find out the solution of this problem
[14:20] yes! only this is left now
[14:25] as if Mehr Ali would be waiting for you that you'll come with a Fatwa (a ruling on a point of Islamic law given by a recognized authority)
[14:30] and he will send off Rutba once again with you, right?
[14:34] I was in anger! I have said it in anger
[14:39] but it doesn't mean that I shall be separated from Rutba
[14:43] I'm telling you, either Mehr Ali or anyone can come in between me & Rutba
[14:48] Greetings!
[14:50] hey come Ronaq, come & sit with me
[14:52] yes..
please come & take out the solution of this problem
[14:57] come
[14:58] we will get the solution as well
[15:01] what is the need to worry a lot? 
First of all we should get to know what is going on over there
[15:15] Azka, you should have gone there
[15:17] but my work is over there
[15:21] what do you mean?
[15:23] I mean, I have to take care of aunty & you over here
[15:28] mom had sent Arfa over there
[15:37] how is your hand now?
[15:46] please start eating
[15:50] eat some
[16:01] Rasheeda
[16:03] Rasheeda
[16:05] yes! yes brother?
[16:11] Rutba, how are you? How are you feeling now?
[16:17] Rasheeda, go & check if Rutba's room is clean
[16:20] brother, I have got each & everything cleaned in her room
[16:25] how would I know that she will come in this condition
[16:31] are you fine?
[16:33] how is your condition?
[16:37] Rasheeda, take her to her room
[16:40] and take care of her
[16:44] come my dear
[17:08] I am highly satisfied now
[17:11] mom, I wish I could have wings then I would have gone to see in what condition Rutba is
[17:17] she had so much of pride on her & Altamash's love
[17:21] she doesn't used to get tired while telling us about her love stories
[17:25] everything got ruined
[17:28] and that Altamash!
[17:30] who couldn't even breathe without Rutba... 
[17:34] he had pronounced the divorce three times in a single go
[17:40] now brother will get to know
[17:42] what grief is... what do we call agony
[17:46] and how one's heart gets injured
[17:55] my daughter will get her love for sure
[17:59] Altamash cannot resist for long
[18:03] Azka, its very easy to win a man's heart
[18:08] specially that man who is already hurt by another woman
[18:14] the antidote of a poison is poison
[18:17] and the antidote of an injury given by a woman is only an ointment applied by another woman
[18:21] are you getting me?
[18:26] I'm understanding everything, mom
[18:28] don't you worry at all
[18:31] I will never leave Altamash alone
[18:35] I will ensure to keep him away from Rutba's memories too
[18:56] dad please, don't stain your hands from his blood
[19:00] otherwise, these stains will stay on your character for life time
[19:03] ask him to... 
[19:06] divorce Ronaq, right away!
[19:11] otherwise, I will not care about the fact that... 
[19:16] whether the blood is staining my hands or character
[19:20] ask him
[19:23] to leave Ronaq
[19:25] or to leave the hope of staying alive.
Tell him!
[19:30] I divorce Ronaq Jahan
[19:36] I divorce her!
[19:38] I divorce her!
[20:22] Rutba
[20:27] dear, Rasheeda was telling me that you are not eating food
[20:36] dear, you will fall sick like this
[20:45] Rutba
[20:48] I'm talking to you, Rutba
[20:53] I have already fallen sick, dad
[20:59] the grief is eating me
[21:04] I am becoming hollow from within
[21:10] I am finishing!
[21:15] are you happy now, dad?
[21:20] you wanted this, right?
[21:23] that Altamash & I shall never be together
[21:28] your lands, wealth, properties, daughter... your every precious thing shall stay with you
[21:40] safe inside your lockers
[21:44] and nobody shall make a demand from you about them
[21:51] dad, whatever you wanted has been done
[21:56] but now... 
[21:59] anyone's consolation... false hopes.. 
[22:04] I don't need anyone's false hopes, or false love at all
[22:13] I don't need it!
[22:59] what are your plans now? 
[23:01] uncle, I had applied for a job in the college as a lecturer. So they have asked me to give the joining
[23:07] I will do that, and I will prepare for PhD along with it 
[23:09] All praise to God! May God bless you with success in every exam of your life
[23:45] Altamash, finally you have called me
[23:49] Azka, I have an important work with you
[23:52] anyways, at least for the sake of work
[23:55] at least you have remembered me
[23:57] tell me, what work is it?
[24:00] listen to me very carefully
[24:02] you have to get me an answer of whatever I am asking you
[24:30] Okay
[24:32] I will let you know after getting information about it
[24:34] but you have to promise me one thing
[24:39] we will meet somewhere outside
[24:42] Okay
[25:22] Khursheed
[25:26] shall I make tea for you?
you haven't eaten your dinner properly as well
[25:31] I am so worried about you
[25:34] why are you worrying, mom?
[25:36] your son is not that weak
[25:40] you should be worried about those who haven't seen any pain or griefs in their life
[25:45] who had never spent a hard life
[25:56] are you talking about Rutba?
[25:58] Khursheed, it will take some time for her to get stabled
[26:02] She used to like Altamash since childhood
[26:06] she was crazy after Altamash
[26:09] the childhood's love spread on the surface of one's heart like a grass
[26:16] and its not an easy thing to separate it from your heart
[26:26] mom, my result have come
[26:30] I've got first position
[26:32] really! heartiest congratulations my dear
[26:36] oh God, thank you so much
[26:38] congratulations Khursheed!
[26:43] greetings uncle!
[26:44] greetings! All praise to God.. very nice
[26:50] I saw this dream for you long time ago, when you were quite small
[26:56] and you entered this house for the first time while holding your mother's finger
[27:02] thank you, uncle
[27:03] I wanted to give this news to you first, but..
[27:08] but what?
[27:10] look, if Rutba is my life then you are also dear to me like a son
[27:19] Rubta's grief has its own place
[27:21] but right now your happiness is really important
[27:27] Rasheeda, heartiest congratulations!
[27:32] distribute the sweets
[27:33] oh brother, what is the need for this?
[27:34] keep it
[27:36] thank you!
[27:39] what are your plans now?
[27:40] uncle, I had applied for a job in the college as a lecturer. So they have asked me to give the joining
[27:46] I will do that, and I will prepare for PhD along with it
[27:49] All praise to God! May God bless you with success in every exam of your life
[27:57] uncle, the college is not in Karachi
[28:01] its in Hassanabad
[28:03] I have made the arrangements of my stay there, so I will live over there
[28:11] Khursheed, whatever you feel appropriate
[28:13] I don't like to come in between the path of success
[28:18] live comfortably, move forward & gain a lot of success
[28:24] I only want this
[28:32] oh mom... 
[28:34] why are you worrying?
[28:36] I will come to meet you every month
[28:50] everything got finished so easily
[28:53] we have dreamt about so many things
[28:57] all of this is the result of Altamash's impatient nature
[29:01] we need to cool down the hunt first then we eat it
[29:08] how will he live now?
[29:11] eventually he will fall in love with someone else but... 
[29:14] Mehr Ali's wealth
[29:19] we have to do something, Bazil
[29:22] I won't be leaving the wealth so easily
[29:25] Altamash, where are you going?
[29:32] the life is running so fast, mom
[29:36] if I will stop somewhere then the time will run ahead of me
[29:41] see you in the evening
[30:09] brother...
[30:21] brother, please do something
[30:23] I am losing my patience now
[30:27] we have to bring back Rutba back to life
[30:31] what if she takes her life while living a suffocating life
[31:03] now tell me, what is the matter
[31:06] why are you in such a hurry?
[31:09] try to have some patience, Altamash
[31:12] didn't you see, how you have done so much of loss because of this impatient nature of yours
[31:20] lets order first, then we'll talk
[31:23] you also order
[31:26] ok?
[32:03] Rutba
[32:06] dear, until when you'll keep yourself locked inside this room?
[32:15] you were so happy to imprison me, right?
[32:20] so now stay unhappy
[32:26] see...
[32:28] your dearest daughter is imprisoned within the tall walls of your mansion
[32:38] her restless soul is imprisoned in her body
[32:48] now see, who will be set free first
[32:57] Rutba
[32:59] don't say such things
[33:04] don't reprimand this way
[33:11] nobody is forcing you for anything
[33:14] you are independent like before
[33:17] go out...
[33:19] call your friends & go for outings
[33:25] I want you to come back towards life
[33:30] and stay happy
[33:32] dad, you had never liked me to be happy & to go for outings
[33:36] then why are you saying all of these things now?
[33:39] leave me alone
[33:43] how shall I leave you?
[33:47] dear, you are the only happiness of my life
[33:56] dad, don't say such things which doesn't suits you
[34:04] you are Mehr Ali Khan
[34:08] the billionaire...
[34:13] nobody can dare to say no upon your orders
[34:18] nobody can smile without your consent
[34:22] but your daughter's heart, Rutba's heart is not your estate dad
[34:29] she had only wished for one person
[34:34] that only person which was her life, happiness, laughter.. he was her everything, dad
[34:45] and your wrong decisions have snatched him away from her for life time
[34:54] now don't keep any sort of expectations from me
[34:57] the hope to live happily, or to stay happy etc..
[35:05] are you happy on your decisions?
[35:14] now let your daughter live her life with empty hands
[35:42] do you know, going out was just an excuse
[35:46] in real I wanted you to come out of the depression
[35:50] tell me honestly, are you feeling better?
[35:56] now tell me, what did the religious scholar had said?
[36:00] I have got all the information
[36:01] its almost impossible for you to get Rutba again
[36:05] what are you saying, Azka?
[36:07] how can it be impossible for a man to get that woman whom he loves?
[36:13] there is a way, but...
[36:16] its impossible for you
[36:20] what are you trying to say? Say it clearly
[36:26] you have pronounced divorce to Rutba three times in one go
[36:30] now you cannot remarry her
[36:33] until she doesn't marry another person
[36:37] and then he leaves her
[36:40] yes, after that you can marry her again
[36:50] are you getting what I am saying?
[36:52] what?
[36:56] yes
[36:59] so tell me
[37:01] will you be able to live happily with such a girl who...
[37:05] had been someone else's wife before becoming your wife?
[37:14] I want to talk to Rutba
[37:17] I want to talk to Rutba right away! and you'll make me speak to her
[37:20] understand?
[38:20] what is this happening, mom?
[38:25] can't you see? I am ironing your clothes
[38:29] I can see that
[38:33] but I can also see what you are trying to hide from me
[38:44] how will I live without you?
[38:48] until I don't kiss your forehead in the morning
[38:52] until I wash your clothes with my own hands
[38:55] until I make tea for you
[38:57] my day doesn't get over
[39:02] how will I live?
[39:04] I have to think that how will my days pass without you
[39:10] I don't like that place where you are not with me
[39:16] the dreams that you have seen for me, this is the first step towards its fulfillment
[39:22] if I will see tears in your eyes, then my journey will become more difficult
[39:33] you will teach very well
[39:36] all of your students will be very happy
[39:41] Do tell them for sure
[39:43] that you teach a very good lesson to your mother as well
[40:18] you haven't understood as of yet
[40:21] that guy was not in love with you but he was in love with Mehr Ali Khan's wealth
[40:28] how shall I explain you my naive daughter?
[40:33] even such a big accident couldn't explain you
[40:45] greetings uncle!
