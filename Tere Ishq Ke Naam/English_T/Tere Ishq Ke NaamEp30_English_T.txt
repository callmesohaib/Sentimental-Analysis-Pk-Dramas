[00:14] Why are you blinding yourself in her love?
[00:18] I don't see any innocence on her face
[00:23] I saw an attraction in her face before.
[00:26] But now I only see is intensity. She only used to look before...
[00:33] but now she only thinks.
[00:44] I didn't come here to give you an explanation, rather I came here with good news.
[00:51] I'm about to give Altamash a successor and after that Altamash will only be mine.
[01:05] Are you here to challenge me?
[01:08] Challenge accepted.
[01:13] Then why don't you try to make Altamash yours...
[01:20] if he becomes yours, then fine. But if he is unable to become yours...
[01:28] then I will make him mine.
[01:33] This game will prove to be very costly for you.
[01:36] I want this to become costly for me. I'm excited.
[01:41] When a player doesn't have a way out...
[01:46] then the only choice they have left is to win the game.
[01:52] Izka... you're the one who started this game.
[01:57] But I'll be the one to win it.
[02:02] If you try and do anything to me, I'll burn everything around you.
[02:14] What else have you done all your life?
[02:22] It's quite hot... close the door on your way out.
[03:07] Be careful on your way Rasheeda... look at your village and stay there as long as you can...
[03:15] I respect their presence and the relationship that I have with them.
[03:29] When this place calls you again...
[03:31] then come back. I will always be there... expecting your return.
[03:36] I will be grateful for your service.
[03:41] Qazda, remember that I'm always focused on Ahad.
[04:24] Auntie, come sit down. I'll have tea brought for you.
[04:28] No my dear I had tea before I came here.
[04:35] What's the matter?
[04:37] You seem sad.
[04:46] I miss Khursheed.
[04:57] Khursheed cried so much.
[05:00] How he yearned?
[05:03] I wonder how he must have controlled himself.
[05:08] How must he have taken care of himself?
[05:11] How did he get better from such a great tragedy?
[05:19] It's been so many days and Khursheed still hasn't called.
[05:25] My dear child has cried so much.
[05:31] He must be taking care of himself.
[05:37] Just like...
[05:40] how we are.
[05:49] Sometimes tears come into my eyes...
[05:53] and sometimes a smile appears on my face out of nowhere.
[06:02] Auntie...
[06:06] Go to the village for a few days.
[06:09] You stay happy and satisfied there.
[06:16] Don't worry about me.
[06:18] Half the day I spend in university and the half of it I spend in my thoughts.
[06:29] What will you do inside this big house alone?
[06:33] How can I leave you here, in this big house, alone?
[06:37] Once Khursheed comes back to take care of you, I'll leave.
[06:46] Auntie, don't worry about my loneliness.
[06:50] Look after your madrassa... prepare the people there for school
[07:03] I'll come there soon.
[07:07] I want to maintain my father's name there.
[07:22] I will be waiting for you.
[07:25] Come there soon.
[07:53] Are you sure that they were talking about Rutbah?
[07:57] Were those papers for Rutbah?
Yes miss.... they were talking about Rutbah...
[08:02] The young sir said that after marrying Rutbah, Mehar Ali's entire inheritance would become hers.
[08:25] I'll see how they achieve this.
[08:28] If I don't make their life hell, my name isn't Aska.
[08:50] Altamash, what is it?
Soon we'll be together.
[08:54] My lawyer has prepared the documents, all I need is your signature.
[09:00] I'll manage the things in court.
It would be better if we talk about this later.
[09:05] I cannot tell you how I've been controlling my emotions up till now.
[09:10] Every moment that passes by seems like a century.
[09:15] That's not something new.
What do you mean?
[09:21] Meaning, you were always like this and so were your emotions.
[09:26] They were always blunt and hurtful.
[09:31] Only for you Rutbah...
[09:38] Please stop making me wait.
[09:43] Should I bring the papers by?
I can't talk about this in front of auntie Rasheeda.
[09:51] Soon she'll leave for the village and then we'll talk about it soon.
[09:57] Can we meet tomorrow?
[10:00] Not now.
[10:04] My relationship with Khursheed is still strong.
[10:09] We'll meet.
[10:12] But for that, you'll have to be patient and wait.
[10:20] Farewell.
[10:23] Farewell.
[13:48] Take good care of yourself, auntie.
Sure, my dear.
[13:52] I don't feel like leaving you alone here.
[13:57] I'm not alone.
[14:00] Father's memories are attached to every part of this house.
[14:07] When I reach there I'll ask Khursheed to leave everything and come to you.
[14:14] I'll ask him to take care of you.
[14:19] I'll ask him to take care of you.
[14:24] Take care of yourself.
[14:27] I'll keep calling you.
[14:45] I'll get going.
[15:15] Why are you calling me? I asked you not to.
[15:18] While you wait there your wife is murdering your respect here!
[15:23] Rutbah and Altamash have decided to marry each other. I heard it!
[15:29] And Rutbah has already set the amount of her dower with Altamash.
[15:34] Altamash has transferred his entire inheritance to Rutbah and do you know what Altamash wants in return...
[15:40] He wants his uncle's entire inheritance, which Rutbah is happy to do for him.
[15:47] Both of them have become blind.
[15:50] Their old love has become a flame that will burn us all!
[15:56] And you're the character of the story that doesn't show up.
[16:00] Play your role Khursheed... the role that uncle handed over to you.
[16:07] You can't handle a single girl... what's the point in you being educated?
[17:23] Let's go..
[17:26] Alright... I'm coming.
[17:31] Where are you going Altamash? The weather is bad outside.
[17:36] I'm not a child that would be scared of the weather.
What should I say to scare you then?
[17:43] Who's name should I speak that would make you stay?
[17:47] With me.
[17:52] On your soon-to-be-born child's life don't go.
[17:57] Your soon-to-be-born son.
[18:08] Are you telling me good news?
[18:16] Not only good news... it's a request.
[18:23] Don't leave your child at the mercy of your decisions.
[18:27] Rutbah is nowhere between us three.
[18:31] Remember that...
Enough...
[18:35] If Rutbah comes into my life, it will make no difference in your life.
[18:44] Believe me.
[18:46] I'll keep you happy.
[18:49] I will give you everything that you deserve.
[18:58] But... Rutbah needs to come into my life.
[19:07] I'm telling you...
[19:10] so that you're mentally prepared.
[19:21] This was bound to happen one day
[19:25] Think of this as karma.
[19:38] When I come back we'll celebrate this good news.
[19:55] Alright, Altamash.
[19:58] Let's celebrate.
[20:15] Why don't you understand why I'm doing all of this in a rush?
[20:24] What do I want?
[20:27] Why can't you see the lava that is boiling inside of me?
[20:36] Why don't you feel its intensity... answer me.
[21:10] Yes Lal Khan, what is it?
[21:16] Altamash?
[21:23] Send him inside.
[22:03] What's the matter Aska?
[22:05] Is there something? I'm going to sleep.
[22:10] I know that you're sleeping... if you were awake you wouldn't be doing all this.
[22:15] Your encouragement is making him spend his honor and his inheritance on Rutbah.
[22:22] This love that he has for Rutbah, he's not the only one responsible for it...
[22:28] you are as well... as well as uncle. Me... my love... and my child can go to hell!
[22:34] You people can go to any lengths to gain an uncle's inheritance.
[22:39] Even if you have to fall at Rutbah's feet.
Mind your tongue!
[22:44] Don't forget that I'm Altamash's mother and your mother-in-law.
[22:48] Your hate has destroyed the relationship between an aunt and her niece.
[22:55] The day you entered Altamash's life was the worst day of his life.
[23:05] You are a conniving... disrespectful... lying girl... full of hatred!
[23:12] How can a person like you bring happiness to her husband and his family?
[23:19] You were never able to sink yourself in our hearts.
[23:25] If Altamash is turning back to Rutbah, why are you surprised?
[23:32] Before accepting someone, you have to show the other person that you are theirs.
[23:37] Look at Rutbah... she's an honorable girl and she has proven her honor. She went through a tragedy...
[23:44] But he still meets with the same love... then there's you...
[23:50] we brought you here as our crown jewel, but you wanted to become a thorn in our side.
[23:56] A thorn that doesn't exist peacefully.
[24:00] If this is causing Altamash and Rutbah to get back together, then Basit and I will support him.
[24:08] We will not stand against him.
[24:11] Yes...
[24:12] I know all this.
[24:14] That's why I also know that you are the real schemer...
[24:19] Uncle and Altamash as well.. not only that you guys are liars and greedy as well.
[24:25] And you're blaming my love?
[24:32] Remember one thing, auntie...
[24:34] When love turns to hate...
[24:37] then everything is ruined...
[24:43] I could have bowed my head in front of Altamash...
[24:46] but...
[24:49] I will never bow my head in front of Rutbah...
[24:54] Remember one thing...
[24:56] Rutbah will become the daughter-in-law of this house.
[25:02] The decision has been made... go.
[25:06] Go, do whatever you want.
[26:08] Why are you here?
[26:10] When I told you not to come here
[26:15] I was so happy to meet you.
[26:19] I couldn't wait.
[26:23] I came here running.
[26:38] What's this?
[26:41] Documents.
[26:46] For the factory in Sheikhupura...
[26:50] For the lands in Seharpur...
[26:53] And for our mansion... all is in your name.
[27:00] This is what you wanted, right?
[27:05] If there's any doubt... you can ask the lawyer to check it out in the morning.
[27:22] You have made me happy.
[27:29] Now it seems that you want me to be with you.
[27:34] Rutbah...
[27:37] Why don't you understand?
[27:43] Why can't you understand the rush I am in?
[27:52] What do I want?
[27:55] Why can't you see the lava that is boiling inside of me?
[28:04] Why don't you feel its intensity... answer me!
[28:14] The shine on your face...
[28:20] Why can't I see the acceptance on your face?
[28:29] Rutbah...
[28:31] don't be so cruel to me.
[28:34] Have mercy.
[28:39] Just once...
[28:41] let me feel your love.
[28:45] Once I feel your love...
Stay away...
[28:49] What is love to you? Only a successor... that's it?
[29:05] Don't be so cold.
[29:10] What haven't I done for you?
[29:13] I gave you everything that you asked for... I didn't refuse.
[29:20] Think about me as well.
[29:23] At least I have that right.
[29:27] What is love to man? It is to accept someone.
[29:34] To be accepted... to burn oneself and others.
[29:42] Don't slant my extremism
[29:48] Rutbah...
[29:53] Look at yourself with my eyes...
[29:58] you will have no complaints against me.
[30:05] You will feel no loss in being mine.
[30:16] Take these and go back!
[30:30] I don't need lust in place of love.
[30:37] Six months...
[30:40] For six months I lived in that flat with Khursheed.
[30:45] We spend night and day under the same roof.
[30:50] If he wanted...
[30:56] he could have stayed in my room with my father's permission in Mehar Ali's house.
[31:02] But he didn't do that.
[31:08] For more than a year...
[31:12] we've been in a lawful relationship.
[31:18] But he never...
[31:22] he never touched me without my permission.
[31:31] He...
[31:33] He never looked at me vilely.
[31:37] He always looked at me...
[31:39] with respect... honor... and love.
[31:48] This is what being a man is about.
[31:54] That is what is called honor.
[32:15] Rutbah...
[32:19] Before praising any other man in front of me remember...
[32:24] that you have promised to be with me.
[32:33] Especially don't praise that poor...
[32:37] two-bit man.
[32:44] Who has a diamond-like you...
[32:47] in his possession.
[32:51] And he doesn't care.
[33:09] Rutbah you've made me happy.
[33:15] I was hurt by you, but still, I've forgotten it.
[33:21] The truth is not that...
[33:24] Khursheed...
[33:28] didn't touch you...
[33:32] Because...
[33:35] he didn't stop coming near you.
[33:39] The truth is that you didn't let him touch you.
[33:52] Because...
[33:54] you think...
[33:59] that you were Altamash's possession...
[34:02] And you will always stay Altamash's possession.
[34:07] That's something to think about, answer me!
[34:11] Answer me Rutbah!
[34:16] Answer me Rutbah!
[34:28] Answer me Rutbah!
[34:40] Khursheed!
[34:46] You can't believe it either, right?
[34:53] I didn't believe it as well.
[35:02] I came to you to offer my condolences after my uncle's demise.
[35:09] But now I think I'll have to offer my condolences to my uncle.
[35:15] I'll have to tell uncle that he's alive...
[35:23] But Mehar Ali is dead.
[35:48] Khursheed... Khursheed... Khursheed, please listen to me!
[36:09] Rutbah! Rutbah!
[36:13] Rutbah!
Khursheed, please wait and listen to me...
[36:25] Is it not that one should listen to the explanation before complaining?
[36:31] Rutbah... an explanation is required.
[36:35] Tell him that he's no one between us... so he should return the same way he came. We've already decided on our future.
[36:43] Enough of your nonsense.
[36:46] Let me talk to him.
Enough Rutbah...
[36:51] All the doors between us are locked forever.
[37:03] I don't need an explanation from you.
[37:07] I don't have any complaints against you.
[37:12] I have complaints against my heart.
Khursheed...
[37:17] Give me a chance to say something...
[37:25] Dead people can't talk.
[37:42] You will get your last possession.
[37:48] Be happy.
[38:09] That's good.
[38:13] The last thorn in our way removed itself.
[38:32] The wise men are right...
[38:35] A man can never understand a woman till his dying breath.
[38:39] I'll get going.
[38:42] I'll come back to either take you with me...
[38:47] or come here to live with you.
[38:54] On your say-so I...
[39:03] I have burned all my ships on your say-so,
[39:08] You don't have the option to turn back...
[39:12] nor do I.
[39:19] I'll get going.
