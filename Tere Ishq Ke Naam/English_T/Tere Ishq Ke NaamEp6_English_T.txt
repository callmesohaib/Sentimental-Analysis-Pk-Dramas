[00:57] congratulations!
[01:05] congratulations brother Bazil
[01:11] my son... heartiest congratulations!
[01:15] congratulations to you too!
[01:32] you are way too late!
[01:51] Sir, he entered forcefully
[01:55] we tried so hard to stop him
[01:57] and sir, he has beaten us as well
[02:10] Altamash please, don't say anything to him
[02:15] otherwise, dad's anger will outrage
[02:18] I will talk to him myself
[02:27] how you have shattered uncle's love & trust
[02:33] didn't your heart trembled for a moment?
[02:36] dad had fixed my wedding with Altamash
[02:40] this marriage had to happen in the future as well, so what's the big deal if it had happened today?
[02:46] and you also get this thing in a nice manner
[02:50] that I haven't done anything wrong
[02:55] you have to come with me right away
[02:59] uncle has called
[03:00] how dare you talking about taking my wife with you in front of me & that too in my house!
[03:12] not Rutba
[03:15] but your corpse will go from this house
[03:18] Fine!
[03:20] I accept it
[03:25] either Rutba will go
[03:28] or my corpse!
[03:38] Altamash! stop
[03:44] let Rutba go with Khursheed
[03:49] if brother has called, then Rutba will go for sure
[04:14] your daughter hasn't done the right thing with me, Sajida
[04:20] a daughter not only ruins her father's trust
[04:25] but his honor as well, when she...
[04:30] crosses the boundary of her house without seeking permission
[04:42] what are you saying, mom?
[04:44] just now we have got married, why shall I send her to uncle?
[04:47] don't be crazy, Altamash! 
As of yet, we have got completed half of our motive
[04:52] only Rutba has become yours
[04:54] brother's wealth & properties are still way too far from our reach
[04:59] Altamash look! We cannot ruin our relationship with him right now
[05:04] right now, Rutba came here with her consent & happiness
[05:07] therefore, the entire blame will not come on us
[05:10] but if we will stop Rutba, then brother will shift the entire blame on us
[05:17] after that, don't know what step he will take in anger
[05:24] my dear look! Rutba is yours now
[05:27] let her go
[05:28] you'll see, he will handover her to us with his own hands
[05:32] and that too as per our conditions
[05:36] and now we will not only take Rutba from him
[05:38] but also the documents of the properties in Rutba's name
[05:44] mom, I haven't seen her completely as of yet
[05:48] dear, you have got an entire life
 you can see her as much as you want to
[05:52] show some patience right now
[06:02] earlier, I was so scared
[06:04] but now it feels that...
[06:07] I have touched the sky in one go
[06:11] Rutba
[06:14] my dear, everything is in your hands now
[06:18] you have to get the lands & properties transferred in your name from uncle
[06:22] all of this is ours
[06:24] if not today but tomorrow we will get everything
but now you come soon to take me
[06:30] now you have got complete right on me
[06:33] dad won't be able to stop me
[06:37] I will come soon to take you
[06:41] but listen to me very carefully about what I want
[06:44] our marriage is half victory
[06:48] We will get the complete victory after getting everything from your father
[06:58] I really don't want you to go from here
[07:02] then stop me
[07:05] try stopping me once
[07:09] I will stay with you for life time over here
[07:15] Sometimes, in order to achieve big targets one needs to give small sacrifices
[07:22] you go
[07:26] go & get your right from uncle
[08:26] what have I done?
[08:29] what!
[08:32] why did I go there with her?
[08:34] what was the need for me to take Rutba to Altamash?
[08:37] neither I would have taken her to Altamash, nor this marriage would have happened
[08:41] even you didn't stopped me, why didn't you explain me?
[08:45] Azka, what's done is done!
[08:49] what is the benefit of getting restless by crying?
[08:53] Azka, whatever it is.. at least its best for you
[08:56] now you will be able to think better for yourself. Forget Altamash
[08:59] No!
[09:04] I cannot forget Altamash
[09:09] He is my love
[09:13] till date, has someone forgotten their love?
[09:29] mom, did you see her? She has become so crazy
[09:33] why don't you explain her anything?
[09:43] I will die. Dad, I won't spare you!
[09:46] all of you are killers of my happiness
[09:49] Ronaq, control yourself. What is this madness!
[09:52] nobody is your enemy, we are your loved ones and we want your betterment
[09:56] nobody wants my betterment! I will destroy everyone
[09:59] all of you have ruined my happiness
[10:02] I will destroy! I will never forgive!
[10:05] dad, remember... I will question each & everyone
[10:08] I won't spare you! I won't. I will never forgive you
[10:24] how much time is left?
[10:26] I am tired
[10:28] after all, why dad has called us there?
[10:31] maybe he had to congratulate you
[10:33] maybe you get some big reward
[10:35] really!
[10:37] you have already got the reward of your boot licking & flattery, No?
[10:43] then why are you having a problem?
[10:45] do you want something else which you didn't got?
[10:47] I do want something else?
[10:49] Still you didn't get what does one want after your departure from your in-laws house after getting married?
[10:54] please stop your non-sense
[10:57] only I have the right on my father's entire wealth. As I am his only daughter
[11:02] there is a lot of difference in taking your own right & to steal someone's right
[11:08] how cleverly you have got that land transferred in your name & nobody even got a hint 
[11:14] what do you think? Don't I know who brain washes my dad against me & Altamash?
[11:21] I will not answer you for any of your blame
[11:24] we give answers to those who have any importance
[11:27] and you are nowhere near in between me & uncle
[11:31] and remember this
[11:36] I had asked you how much time is left?
[11:39] 2 hours!
[11:40] still 2 hours?
[11:43] I am so tired, I am hungry, also thirsty and... 
[11:47] I want tea as well
[11:49] why not? there should be a dinner in the joy of your marriage from my side, but it should happen
[12:09] it seems that you are not happy at all about my marriage
[12:12] otherwise, you would have congratulated
[12:17] after all, you are my cousin
[12:23] I would have congratulated you for sure
[12:27] if this marriage would have happened as per uncle's consent
[12:33] and I feel so strange, that how happy you are after hurting your father
[12:41] if I had such a father, then I would have respected & honored him a lot
[12:47] You got so much of love without asking for it
[12:50] without any hard work you have all the blessings luxuries in your house that thousands of people don't have
[13:00] you are taking undue advantage of your father's love, Rutba
[13:06] you need an advise instead of congratulations!
[13:11] stop your advise
[13:14] I know you are jealous
you are just jealous of everything
[13:22] you have always shifted every blame on my head
[13:25] and I have tolerated everything happily
[13:29] but all of this is useless now
[13:33] anyways.. 
[13:38] whether I had congratulated you for your marriage or not
[13:42] I have given you a treat for sure, so stay witness to it
[13:46] lets go now, we are getting late
[15:10] dad
[15:18] dad, I am sorry... 
[15:29] you have killed your father!
[15:31] now if you see him walking & breathing
[15:36] then think that its your delusion
[15:43] dad
[15:46] but dad, I haven't committed any sin
[15:50] some blood is not shed on the ground
[15:53] but it happens
[15:56] by burning your father's love & trust
[16:01] you have lighten Altamash's ego & stubbornness
[16:05] remember!
[16:07] now in the same light you will see all those faces
[16:12] which your father had tried to hide from you
[16:18] go!
[16:19] go & do rest, as you have already made your father sleepless
[16:49] uncle
[16:52] please forgive me, because of my mistake
[16:55] I have taken all the mistakes on my head
[16:59] you also go & rest, you must be tired
[17:04] its not an easy task to take the burden of someone else
[17:51] mom.. 
[17:57] come sit
[18:04] here comes our groom
[18:06] Sanober, look.. he is looking so fresh
[18:10] why he won't look fresh? After all, our prince has won the battle
[18:16] mom, as of yet I have passed one exam
[18:21] there are other trials left
[18:24] now we have to see what will uncle do
[18:28] he will give us tough time by putting restrictions on Rutba
[18:30] but now I won't honor any restrictions imposed by uncle
[18:36] Rutba is only mine
[18:41] if uncle tried to do anything wrong
[18:45] then I will give a brick for a stone
[18:49] good!
[18:52] I'm leaving
[19:10] yes uncle, did you call me?
[19:14] I have called the lawyer
[19:17] whatever I have transferred in Rutba's name till date
[19:21] I am taking it back
[19:25] Rutba will go empty hands from her father's house
[19:28] to her in-laws house
[20:16] we have to distribute the sweets in the entire neighborhood, after all my son has got married
[20:21] and that too with Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[20:24] its not an ordinary thing
[20:28] the bride will bring happiness & blessings in this house, madam
[20:32] my Altamash's bride is the ocean of happiness & joy
[20:37] you'll see, how my Altamash will live a luxurious life. God willing
[20:42] after all he has become the son-in-law of Mehr Ali Khan
[20:45] now his loftiness will be very different
[20:48] All praise to God, my son is not less than any Prince
[20:53] and sister you?
[20:54] are you less than a queen? We had always respect you from the bottom of our heart
[21:00] and now after Rutba's wedding, the loftiness of your family has increased. Honestly!
[21:07] aunty, where is Altamash?
[21:10] he has gone to distribute the sweets among his friends
[21:13] sister, have you decided to inform everyone?
[21:19] so, what else?
[21:20] this was the reason I had experienced a lot of difficulty for this marriage
[21:23] so that brother Mehr Ali shall come under pressure & shall wed off Rutba with us
[21:27] once the matter will spread in the family, then only it will get out of control from brother's hands
[21:32] sister
[21:34] you are very well aware of brother's stubbornness
[21:37] if he comes on his stubbornness, then he can change everything
[21:41] his stubbornness is very cruel
[21:45] that was his sister's matter, Ronaq
[21:47] and this is his daughter's matter
[21:49] yes... and that daughter, which is aorta
[21:54] brother must have got a big shock
[21:57] he must have swerved in pain
[21:59] but this time he'll accept the defeat, you'll see Ronaq
[22:04] his daughter's love will win over his stubbornness
[22:07] please sit, let me send the tea
[22:11] let me inform the driver to whom he has to to give the sweets
[22:14] come sit
[22:44] Sir, I am keeping your luggage in the car
[22:47] Okay
[22:52] come Khursheed
[22:55] uncle, did you call me? Is everything alright? Are you going somewhere?
[22:58] yes dear, I am going to Karachi
[23:02] and Rutba?
[23:03] Rutba will stay here, as well as you
[23:07] this time her mistake is not as such to be ignored
[23:13] She has to take the burden of her decisions herself
[23:16] I..
[23:19] I will call Rubta to Karachi after talking to Sanober & Altamash
[23:23] until then take care of her
[23:26] uncle, I have disappointed you once but...
[23:29] this time I will not give you a chance to complain
[23:31] don't worry, Rutba is my responsibility
[23:36] dear, you are very precious to me
[23:39] you have supported me in every situation
[23:42] even you are very important for me, uncle
[23:46] I have learn how to live from you
[23:48] I respect you a lot
[23:52] stay blessed dear, I am leaving
[24:31] Nisar Ali
yes Mr. Shah?
[24:33] have you sorted the land related matters with the lawyer?
[24:36] yes sir
[24:37] I am going to the city, Rutba & Rasheed are here
[24:41] take care of them
[24:42] don't worry, Mr. Shah
[25:10] dad
[25:12] dad...
[25:14] Rutba
[25:15] dad
[25:16] Rutba, where are you going?
[25:17] dad..
Rutba
[25:20] Rutba!
[25:21] dad
[25:22] Rutba
[25:22] dad, please stop
Rutba!
[25:25] Rutba!
leave me!
[25:27] don;t touch me
[25:29] I hate you!
[25:30] you can hate me as much as you want to
[25:33] but don't forget that you are just a responsibility for me
[25:36] the respect that is there in between us is because of uncle
[25:40] and I tolerate all of your actions because of him
[25:43] lie! complete lie!
[25:45] you don't love my father at all
[25:47] its all drama
[25:49] don't I understand?
[25:51] you want a share in my father's wealth and you are waiting for it. That's why you want to marry me as well
[25:58] aunt Rasheeda & you want to make a castle of your dreams upon the basis of my deceased mother's innocent wish
[26:05] Rutba!
[26:10] I won't hear a single word against my mother
[26:17] you can abuse me, curse me
[26:21] you can say bad things to me
[26:23] but not a single word against my mother
[26:27] no doubt it was my late aunt's desire, but never ever think that I wish to marry you
[26:35] with such thinking, you are good to go with a greedy person like Altamash
[26:42] no matter how ordinary I am, still my thinking is so good
[26:48] and you cannot fit into it
[27:00] don't know what do you think of yourself!
[27:02] you have no comparison with my Altamash
[27:05] his servants are also better than you
[27:08] you...
[27:25] are you missing Rutba?
[27:28] yes
[27:31] I don't understand my mother's decision
[27:33] I don't know why she has sent her back
[27:36] I couldn't even see her properly after the marriage
[27:43] She was looking so pretty, right?
[27:46] her beauty & her eyes are stuck on my mind
[27:51] there was love, expressions & desires in her eyes
[27:56] she wanted to say a lot, also she wanted to hear so many things
[28:01] oh mom...
[28:04] why did you send her back
[28:08] now her phone is also off
[28:11] its impossible to contact her
[28:15] uncle, how much more oppression you will do?
[28:20] I will take the revenge of everything
[28:23] I will take the revenge of each & every matter
[28:29] don't ever consider yourself alone or helpless
[28:32] I am with you at every moment
[28:39] I mean.. I, my mother & aunt
[28:43] all of us are with you
[28:47] soon Rutba will be with me as well
[28:57] hey, why not?
[28:59] not only Rutba but her entire wealth as well
[29:03] you have killed two birds with one stone
[29:07] by the way, if your lover is rich
[29:11] so does she look more beautiful?
[29:14] yes
[29:16] such kind of wife keeps a husbands head high with pride
[29:20] alright then, lets go on a dinner in the joy of your marriage
[29:25] without Rutba?
[29:26] hey! our friendship also mean something
[29:30] what's the big deal if Rutba is not here?
[29:32] her discussion will be there
[29:34] yes... true that
[29:37] I also want to discuss Rutba
[29:39] a lot of discussion
[29:41] let's go then. Let me get my bag
[29:46] come on
[29:53] sister, I think you should talk to brother
[29:56] the entire day has passed since Rutba has gone, and brother hadn't contacted
[30:00] its not a good sign
[30:05] No Ronaq, its better to stay quiet now
[30:11] brother is taking out his anger on Rutba
[30:14] and its better for us
[30:16] the more time will pass
[30:19] he will realize that the snake has already passed
[30:23] and now there is no use of crying over spilt milk
[30:27] No sister, I don't think so that brother will accept this reality so easily
[30:32] as far as the matter is concerned about transferring the wealth & lands on Altamash's name
[30:36] its like the same example, "to snatch away the sugarcane from an elephant's mouth"
[30:43] we have already snatched the girl from him
[30:46] we'll show him how to take the lands & properties too
[30:49] don't worry Ronaq
[30:52] we'll take the revenge of your each & every wound
[30:55] that's right brother Bazil, you have snatched the girl already
[30:59] but if she will come without wealth & properties
[31:03] So, what is the benefit of you people in it?
[31:10] oh my dear brother... the peace of my eyes
[31:15] Bazil, move forward.. greet him & give him a hug
[31:22] one should save their chest from the people who attack on your back
[31:28] Such people take away the heart after slitting off the chest
[31:33] and hey don't give you a hint even
[31:36] how dare you people got my daughter married by calling her here fraudulently & that too without my consent?
[31:45] brother Mehr Ali, I had explained you
[31:48] at present, the children are at the most innocent phase of their lives
[31:52] their emotions are way too dangerous than the waves of a rough sea
[31:57] but you didn't listen to me
[31:59] now see, what they did!
[32:02] even I & Bazil were unaware of it
[32:06] Rutba had compelled Altamash
[32:09] she doesn't accept the restrictions imposed on her by you
[32:12] she came here by breaking all the restrictions
[32:14] and we didn't had any other option except for accepting our children happiness
[32:23] you are lying, Sanober!
[32:25] Clear lie!
[32:27] you, your husband & your son are fraudster, dishonest & liar people
[32:35] uncle!
[32:41] you are forgetting that today you are not standing in your sister's house, but in your daughter's in-laws house
[32:46] I am not forgetting, Altamash
[32:48] you did the mistake
[32:50] and be ready for the consequences
[32:53] you cannot threaten me
[32:55] I am your daughter's husband
[32:58] your daughter is my wife now
[33:01] you cannot separate us even if you want to
[33:04] I don't want to separate
[33:07] a daughter does not only cross the boundary of her father's house
[33:10] but she breaks that branch of a tree on which her home was built
[33:15] and the birds doesn't live on the broken branches
[33:24] you have misguided my daughter
[33:26] now both of you shall stay together for life time
[33:33] when are you coming to get her?
[33:39] brother Mehr Ali, don't blame Altamash only
[33:44] marriage isn't one sided matter
[33:47] Rutba had married Altamash with her consent
[33:51] being elders, we don't have to confuse this matter instead we have to solve it
[33:56] Sanober, I haven't come to favor or make complain about anyone
[34:01] I have come to decide the date for the departure ritual after marriage
[34:03] also, I have come to tell that heritage, wealth, lands & properties are transferred on the name of that child
[34:08]  which is obedient, dutiful & respectful
[34:13] and rebellious children gets punishment
[34:15] and as a punishment, I disinherit Rutba from all of my wealth & properties
[34:23] Rutba will come in this house empty hands
[34:39] today is Monday
[34:41] Come to Mehr Ali house on Thursday evening with guests & take away your wife
[34:49] I hope you will fulfill this relation for life time
[35:23] heritage, wealth, lands & properties are transferred on the name of that child
[35:27]  which is obedient, dutiful & respectful
[35:30] and rebellious children gets punishment
[35:32] and as a punishment, I disinherit Rutba from all of my wealth & properties
[35:37] I hope you will fulfill this relation for life time
[35:46] this is amazing!
[35:56] mom
[35:59] Azka is crying crazily over there
[36:02] she is mourning over her lost love, which was never hers
[36:07] and here you are laughing
[36:10] can I know, what as such you have got that you are being so happy?
[36:14] I am feeling so satisfied after such a long time
[36:18] you cannot understand
[36:22]  some what I can understand
[36:26] go, look at Azka's condition. What has she done to herself
[36:29] make her understand, mom
[36:34] go & tell her, the Autumn season is very concise
[36:40] the flowers & fruits are already hidden in the tree
[36:43] they find their way to come out
[36:46] Azka will also get her way
[36:48] why is she being so impatient?
[36:51] until Ronaq Jahan is alive, no body can dare to snatch away her children happiness from them
[37:01] Go, tell her
[37:37] Sir
[37:39] yes
[37:40] Madam Rutba hasn't eaten anything since morning. Again she has returned the food
[37:47] keep he food on the table outside her room
[37:50] She will eat once she will feel hungry
[37:52] Okay Sir
[37:54] and listen
[37:55] yes
[37:58] do let me know when she is done eating the food
[38:00] Okay sir
[38:10] the same thing happened about which I was scared
[38:15] there isn't any dear or so of anything, aunty
[38:18] what does uncle think? Is it so easy to disinherit anyone?
[38:22] I will do the case in the court & will make him go trough very tough times
[38:25] Altamash! if Mehr Ali has threatened then its not uselessly
[38:30] here you will stay in the delusion & there he will change the game
[38:36] As it is, what will we do with Rutba without any wealth or so?
[38:41] We don't want to earn any reward by marrying any orphan, poor or unfortunate girl
[38:48] your father is right, Altamash
[38:52] whatever brother Mehr Ali says, he ensures to do it
[38:56] therefore, we have to take a strong step now
[39:00] don't worry, mom
[39:05] I had shown you how I got Rutba
[39:07] now I will show you how I will get his wealth & properties
[39:11] uncle will spend the rest of his life in the mental asylum
