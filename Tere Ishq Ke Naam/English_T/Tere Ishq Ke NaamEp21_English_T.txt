[00:14] I will leave if you want. 
[00:19] Are you compelled to obey me?
[00:26] You don't your own will? 
[00:31] My will?
[01:00] Miss Tazmeen
[01:02] yes
[01:03] I have a request from you. 
[01:06] Yes, what's up?
[01:09] I don't want Khurshid to know about Altamash's visit.
[01:16] OK 
[01:17] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[01:33] Tabrez, have you clicked the pictures?
[01:35] yes sir, I have
[01:50] the pictures are really nice
[01:53] send these pictures to Mehr Ali Khan
[01:57] whatever you order, sir
[02:44] brother.... I want to make a request to you
[02:50] tell me Rasheeda, just say it. Why are you requesting? Please sit
[03:01] I am thinking to go to my village & live there for sometime
[03:06] is everything fine?
[03:09] how come you are thinking about going to the village?
[03:11] its been so long
[03:15] I didn't see that in what condition my old house is
[03:22] its walls, doors, sand... 
[03:29] has been calling me since so long
[03:32] I am thinking to go & see them once
[03:36] also I shall stay over there for sometime
[03:44] as you feel happy, Rasheeda
[03:47] I cannot stop you
[03:51] whenever you want to go ask the driver, he will drop you
[03:55] and call us whenever you feel like coming back
[04:00] anyways, I always wait for everyone
[04:09] I will also wait for you to come back
[04:17] yes, thank you...
[05:41] you couldn't get married to Altamash and your Nikah also ended.
[05:45] Not only uncle's tricks and Altamash's foolishness was the reason for that 
[05:50] but there is cleverness and conspiracies.
[05:53] Whose conspiracies? 
[05:55] My mom
[05:58] I mean your aunt and Azka
[06:05]  Till breaths remain in our body 
[06:09] and heartbeats in our hearts.
[06:13] Then everything is possible.
[06:16] just once... 
[06:19]  Just say "Yes" once, I will make every impossible thing possible.
[06:49] Rutba
[07:07] when did you come?
[07:08] I was thinking that I will come & you must be waiting for me
[07:12] but you are lost in your own thoughts
[07:15] No... its not the matter
[07:19] did somebody came?
[07:25] No... why are you asking?
[07:29] the door is opened
[07:33] actually... 
[07:35] Ms. Tazmeen came, she just went a while ago
[07:41] anyways, everyone had the dinner on the way but I didn't. And I am really very hungry
[07:48] Ok then, let me serve the dinner
[08:05] you really don't remember what we had discussed in the evening?
[08:10] We had to go out for the dinner
[08:13] yes! I do remember, I got dressed up as well
[08:20] see, how am I looking?
[08:23] you like this color, right?
[08:26] I like all the colors on you
[08:30] no matter what you wear, you look so beautiful
[08:47] I am so hungry, shall we go?
[09:10] Azka's settlement is a different thing, 
I won't let Rutba live peacefully.
[09:17] Even today, my voice can deprive her of peace and tranquility.
[09:24] You know this and so do I.
[10:34] will you be able to sit & eat here, Rutba?
[10:39] yes
[10:42] why do you think that I don't like all this?
[10:50] I like everything now
[10:56] what do you mean by everything? Please explain
[11:04] how do you teach in the college?
[11:08] what do you mean by that?
[11:11] its my desire & passion
[11:16] first learn how to read
[11:17] what?
[11:22] closed books also have a meaning 
[11:27] do we need explanation of everything?
[11:31] really!
[11:34] it seems that you are reading my books secretly
[11:39] I was also thinking, since when you have become so intelligent
[11:45] Oh! but you didn't get any wisdom by reading so many books though
[11:50] if I would have read so many books, then I would have been a poet by now
[11:54] and I would have written a lot of poetry
[11:56] really!
[12:00] so one thing is decided, all of my books are yours now
[12:05] what will you read then?
[13:15] You are having it Rasheeda, isn't that enough?
[13:19] I didn't understand.
[13:22] If you could understand that then why would it happen?
 My brother loves you more than us.
[13:28] And why would your value be more and ours is less in this house?
[13:32] You live in this castle like house as a queen but look like a servant.
[13:38] I couldn't adopt such get up Rasheeda.
[13:43] That's why whenever I come here, I count the bitterness of brother's tone and his wrinkles of forehead.
[13:51] But you are fine. Everything is good for you.
[14:29] do you know
[14:32] the area in which I had spent my childhood
[14:35] we hardly used to have basic necessities over there
[14:40] there was only one school
[14:43] and do you know, who takes care of all the expenses of the poor students studying there?
[14:50] your father...  Mehr Ali Khan
[14:59] he did so many favors on the people of this area
on me & on my parents
[15:07] I have also got my basic education from the same school
[15:14] uncle loves education
[15:17] he loves educated people, broad minded people, and well educated thoughts
[15:25] there are very less people like uncle in this world
[15:31] and maybe, I will never be able to become like him
[15:41] do you know
[15:44] do you know, Khursheed
[15:48] I really feel like completing my studies
[15:58] when you teach your students and explain them
[16:04] they respect you a lot & love you so much. They honor you so much
[16:11] I feel so good
[16:14] I feel like.... 
I also
[16:21] I shall also become like you little bit
[16:26] you are good like this as well
[16:29] but I will never refuse any of your wish ever
[16:33] if you want to study then go ahead for sure
[16:36] then both of us together will keep the basis of a college
[16:46] will you go to my area along with me?
[17:16] take this
[17:18] what's with you? Try eating something & take care of yourself, Azka
[17:23] why you have taken so many worries on your head?
[17:26] dear look, whatever you wanted... you have got everything, right?
[17:31] slowly & gradually you'll get rest of the things too
[17:37] Its just that I shall hear it once from Altamash's mouth that
[17:42] he is only mine, not of Rutba at all
[17:47] then I will be able to spend my life peacefully
[17:51] the day you'll give him the good news of the baby
[17:54] believe me Azka, after that day he'll be only yours
[18:02] Also he was born after a lot of prayers
[18:06] do you know, sister Sanober used to cry a lot that she doesn't have a child
[18:13] and now see, if Altamash wouldn't have been born
[18:17] then she wouldn't have been ruling in her house like a queen like this
[18:21] you'll see Azka, the day you'll give them the good news of the baby
[18:26] you will also rule on that house completely
[18:30] and you!
[18:33] kindly don't fight with each other
[18:35] I want to see love & affection in between you two
[18:39] my heart cries a lot when you both fight with each other
[18:43] mom, Azka is exactly like you
[18:47] the way you have bad intentions for all including aunt Sanober, uncle, & Rutba
[18:53] the same way Azka's heart is also filled with hatred
[18:58] did you hear? whenever she speaks, she spills poison
[19:03] and I can't tolerate such words of her
[19:06] Azka, when you find the truth bitter & the mirror become intolerable
[19:11] then you need to fix your face & soul as well
[19:19] listen!
[19:26] mom, my friend has a brother Hamdan
[19:31] they want to bring my proposal tomorrow
[19:34] do say "yes"
[19:36] because I don't want to live in this poisonous environment anymore
[19:41] after that you can support Azka as much as you want to
[20:01] now you've understood?
[20:03] I used to tell you, she is jealous of me
[20:08] She is after her marriage, since I got married
[20:13] her proposal is coming
[20:41] by the way, you showed such a hurry
[20:47] it takes a bit of time for the spark to become a fire 
[20:55] but you came to see the spectacle immediately
[21:02]  I am so disappointed, by the way
[21:19] Rutba, kindly check the grocery once. I think everything is there
[21:23] lentils... 
[21:25] we forgot to buy the oil
[21:28] I'm sorry, I didn't remember at all
but why am I saying sorry?
[21:32] I mean, I am stupid but you are smart
[21:39] you haven't become a professor yet & look at your condition
[21:43] Okay, let me go & bring it right away
[21:45] sure?
yes
[21:47] ok listen! until then I will make tea for you but please do come quickly
Ok
[22:10] greetings!
[22:11] also give me that big box of chocolate
[22:15] you must be buying the chocolates for your wife, but we need treat
[22:20] you guys are here
[22:21] we just came out for a walk & thought of doing the grocery too
[22:24] yes! women needs an excuse... then it can be a cooking oil
[22:31] because if there won't be oil, then omelet cannot be made
[22:33] and if omelet won't be made then we won't get breakfast, and if we don't get the breakfast
[22:37] then the mood will be off
absolutely!
[22:40] this is household, Mr. Khursheed. Not your two pages lecture
[22:43] I've got an idea by now
[23:09] the way I feel a strange happiness in my heart while doing anything for you, Khursheed Hasan
[23:17] why does my heart fear to give it any name
[23:21] I am unable to understand that until when this heart will be scared
[23:25] your eyes gives me courage
[23:28] your smile calls me closer to you
[23:32] but your self-respect & solemnity stops me on the threshold
[23:39] yes! but you have taught a lot to Rutba Behr Ali Khan
[23:44] this patience, courage & strength
[23:46] and to do a lot for someone, my heart has learnt all this from you
[23:51] thank you!
[24:10] I feel so good to see you both happy like this
[24:13] thank you so much, Ms. Tazmeen
[24:16] honestly speaking, I didn't had an idea that everything can be so good & beautiful
[24:23] anyways, I am leaving
[24:25] bye!
[24:36] Rutba, I have brought the oil
[24:44] also, I have brought something for you as well
[24:50] Rutba
[25:10] the tea is ready as well, you came early
[25:17] Khursheed
[25:24] Khursheed!?
[25:27] what happen?
[25:36] you still meet Altamash?
[25:44] do you remember, I had said to you that there is only one thing good about our relation
[25:51] that we speak the truth with each other
[25:57] but today I have got to know
[26:03] that neither there is anything good or truth in our relation
[26:10] Khursheed... 
[27:11] travel safe, Rasheeda
[27:14] visit your village
[27:16] stay there until you feel happy
[27:20] I value the relation & love of a sister
[27:26] do come back whenever you want to
[27:30] I will wait for you
[27:33] I am indebted to your love
[27:36] I am grateful to your services & generosities
[27:41] and... 
[27:43] remember that an indebted heart is always waiting
[27:52] what are you saying, brother?
[27:55] every part of Rasheeda's soul is grateful to you. And pray for you
[28:00] one cannot stay away for long from those people who are like a shadow in the scorching heat
[28:08] I will come back for sure, brother
[28:12] no matter what, but nothing is more precious that your selfless love
[28:21] I shall take your leave now, brother
[28:25] bye!
[28:27] in God's protection
[29:04] Mehr Ali, a human doesn't live in a house
[29:08] a human lives happily only in the heart
[29:12] a human doesn't live on the basis of heartbeat & breath
[29:16] he lives on the basis of love & trust
[29:21] when a person doesn't get a place to live in the heart of their loved ones
[29:27] then a house doesn't remains a shelter, Mehr Ali
[29:31] Sir... 
[30:29] Miss Tazmeen
[30:33]  I have a request from you. 
[30:35] Yes, what's up?
[30:38] I don't want Khurshid to know about Altamash's visit.
[30:45] OK 
[30:46] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[31:17] good morning!
[31:22] Can I come inside?
[31:40] is Mr. Khursheed at home or he has left for the college?
[31:45] whether he is at home or college
[31:49] but he is not far from your access
[31:53] by the way, you showed such a hurry
[31:59] it takes a bit of time for the spark to become a fire 
[32:07] but you came to see the spectacle immediately
[32:14] I am so disappointed, by the way
[32:18] you should have an idea that you are Mr. Khursheed's better half
[32:23] words are the mirror of one's character
[32:27] at least you can learn the manners to talk to someone from the person you are living with
[32:32] but what to do? Honestly, its disappointing
[32:41] you don't like me with Khursheed, right?
[32:48] if you say so, then shall I leave my place?
Rutba!
[32:53] if a person gives you some respect, then learn the skill to handle it
[32:59] God has blessed you with everything, but you don't know how to handle anything
[33:04] neither love, nor respect or esteem
[33:08] I fear what if you loose everything
[33:32] sometimes a person desires to stoop so low
[33:38] I wish, I could stoop so low the way you have fallen in my eyes today
[34:50] No Rutba no, we cannot spend our lives like this
[34:54] deceiving face, deceiving eyes, deceiving relation!
[34:59] all of this is not less than a punishment
[35:02] and I don't accept this punishment
[35:36] yes greetings Laal Khan, is everything fine?
[35:47] Okay, we are coming
[36:26] if a person gives you some respect, then learn the skill to handle it
[36:30] God has blessed you with everything, but you don't know how to handle anything
[36:34] neither love, nor respect or esteem
[36:38] I fear what if you loose everything
[36:53] sometimes a person desires to stoop so low
[36:57] I wish, I could stoop so low the way you have fallen in my eyes today
[37:48] I am going back home
[37:51] I have called the car, the driver is here
[37:55] We will go together
[37:58] uncle is in the hospital, he got a heart attack
[38:02] we have to go immediately
