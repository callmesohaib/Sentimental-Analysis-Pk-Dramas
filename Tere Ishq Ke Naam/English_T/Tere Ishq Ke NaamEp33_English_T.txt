[00:14] now whether you consider yourself as the guest or an animal in this house
[00:19] its your choice 
[00:24] Altamash, at least finish your breakfast. Where are you going?
[00:27] I am already done 
[00:30] I am going to Rutba
[00:33] I will ensure to fix the wedding date today
[00:45] Yes Altmash! Ask Azka to return all the gold that we've given her on the wedding
[00:57] after all, we are going to marry Rutba 
[01:00] and no matter how much the gold is, its always less
[01:04] Besides, this gold isn't of her use anymore
[01:10] only that woman is the bride, whom her husband loves 
[01:14] Its enough for her that we've allowed her to stay in this house
[02:13] Welcome, please have a seat
[02:17] I am so proud of you
[02:20] You both have proved yourself quite intelligent in the UK
[02:24] getting a job offer & that too so quickly is its proof 
[02:29] Thank you!
[02:30] by the way Khursheed Hasan, didn't you feel like accepting such a great job offer?
[02:35] not for a moment, sir
[02:37] I had decided before leaving that when I will come back after studying, then I will take out my country from this darkness of illiteracy 
[02:44] this is my only mission & goal
[02:47] Very nice! People like you are the bright future of this country
[02:52] Thank you, sir
[02:55] And what is this marriage related matter?
[02:59] Sir?
[03:04] Sir, she wasn't agreed but I had compelled her
[03:09] and the best thing is that she has honored my words
[03:13] I didn't get anything. How come everything happened all of a sudden
[03:22] Believe me, all of this is done by Khursheed
[03:27] Well done Khursheed Hasan. Well done! You did this great work along with your studies
[03:32] Both of you will soon get your promotion letters
[03:35] and hopefully both of you will be appointed as the professor in the university
[03:40] do continue with your PhD program
[03:43] I will feel really happy on that day when I will call you Doctor Khursheed Hasan
[03:50] yes sir
[03:52] Thank you!
[03:55] all the best!
[04:01] come on kids... 
[04:03] its an off time now, come on
[04:08] come here
[04:19] and do come tomorrow
[04:36] Khursheed! Have you come to Pakistan?
[04:39] Greetings mom, how are you?
[04:42] Greetings! Stay blessed my son. Look at your mother's craziness
[04:47] you call me from England
[04:49] but seeing at your Pakistani number just now, I had felt as if you are so close to me
[04:55] It is like that mom. Nobody can understand distances & affinity better than love
[05:03] I just came today to Hasanabad, there was a welcome party & joining too
[05:09] also I had some important work, I will come to you as soon as I get free from them
[05:13] Khursheed, did you talk to Rutba?
[05:19] she has completed her studies too
[05:22] Rutba has kept the honor of her father's will
[05:25] she has become so wise, whenever she speaks it feels as if her father is speaking
[05:31] Ok mom, I will come to you in a few days
[05:34] do bring along my daughter-in-law, Khursheed
[05:39] Khursheed
[05:44] come & have the tea, its ready
[05:46] Okay mom, I'll talk to you later
[05:50] Khursheed!
[05:52] Khursheed, listen to me dear
Khursheed
[06:27] Greetings aunty, how are you?
[06:30] Greetings! I am fine, how are you dear?
[06:34] I am also fine
[06:36] my university is completed
[06:41] there are a few works here
[06:45] so I will come to you as soon as possible after completing them
[06:52] after dad's demise I don't understand with whom I shall share my grief 
[07:01] on whose shoulder I shall cry upon
[07:05] I miss you a lot, aunty
[07:08] dear Rutba, do you know Khursheed is in Pakistan. In Hasanabad
[07:14] aunty, he must have called but maybe I was busy that's why I couldn't receive it
[07:20] No dear, this matter is different
[07:26] Khursheed has started to ignore your topic
[07:30] and I have been observing this since quite long
[07:36] a man cannot be trusted, Rutba
[07:39] they don't take time to turn away their eyes
[07:45] his friend Tazmeen is always with him like a shadow
[07:51] even now she was with him while I was talking to him
[07:58] what is this? He didn't even called you
[08:02] I won't forgive him if there is something inappropriate
[08:06] anything inappropriate?
[08:09] dear Rutba, quickly go to Khursheed 
[08:14] what if he had married Tazmeen?
[08:19] its a good thing, aunty
[08:21] every person should have the right to spend their life as per their choice
[08:27] Rutba!
[08:28] yes aunty
[08:30] if this is true then I will congratulate them myself
[08:35] don't you worry
[09:25] what are you looking at?
[09:27] you are looking so handsome
[09:31] thank you!
[09:33] what is this?
[09:42] my entire jewelry
[09:46] I've brought everything, I haven't kept anything for myself
[09:53] aunty is right that... 
[09:58] the actual bride is one, whose husband loves her
[10:03] You hardly look at me
[10:09] if you'll look at me once in exchange of this, then that moment will be more precious to me than this jewelry
[10:16] Azka, what will you trade now after losing your most precious thing?
[10:25] there are no emotions for the person who falls from your eyes
[10:35] shall I give you a suggestion?
[10:38] take divorce from me
[10:41] you will stay happy & satisfied
[10:42] No Altamash!
[10:45] for God sake, never say this again ever
[10:49] where will I go? I will die without you. I have no one
[10:54] Altamash you... 
[10:57] Fine!
[11:00] your choice then
[11:03] but then always be thankful to Rutba
[11:10] because this status is given to you by her
[12:14] Khursheed!
[12:49] Rutba, he is that guy who loves you since childhood
[12:53] he is in love with you
[12:56] and this love isn't that greedy & self-centered love that Altamash did
[13:01] this love is that fruit which had emerged from your mother's innocent desire
[13:08] and he had tired his level best to hide it
[13:14] He had never looked at you completely
[13:19] he never did dishonesty
[13:22] also he never did abuse of trust
[13:33] won't you wish Mr. Khursheed?
[13:36] there isn't any lack of people to wish Mr. Khursheed
[13:39] but how can somebody fill in your place, Rutba?
[13:42] Look at him carefully, how happy Mr. Khursheed looks
[13:46] try to congratulate & give him birthday wishes
[13:50] then you'll see from your own eyes how his happiness will increase, also you'll feel it from your soul
[13:59] Happy birthday!
[14:08] Thank you!
[14:55] Today, you aren't looking Rutba Mehr Ali but Mehr Ali Khan
[15:02] no matter if you are not like uncle but... 
[15:05] his reflected image is hidden in you
[15:07] his accent speaks in your accent
[15:12] he is hidden somewhere with you, its just that you don't know
[17:15] Hello!
[17:18] Yes Azka, tell me
[17:24] what shall i say, Khursheed?
[17:28] nothing is left with me to say
[17:33] can somebody be so empty like me?
[17:41] Tell me something, you had read so many books
[17:47] if nothing is left with a person
[17:50] then how does that person lives?
[17:53] Azka, there is one reality of this world
[17:56] a person came here all alone, and he will go away from here all alone
[18:07] whichever relations, love, hatred & happiness.. everything will remain here
[18:14] therefore try not to take the burden of all these things on your shoulders while going away from here
[18:20] what if someone have a burden on its heart, then?
[18:23] so much that a person couldn't even breathe
[18:26] try to be happy in other happiness
[18:29] you will stay peaceful
[18:33] a person becomes breathless only when he runs after his happiness
[18:39] Khursheed, I don't understand how do you gather so much of courage & strength?
[18:44] I feel as if I will die under the burden of this grief
[18:49] what as such has happened?
[18:52] why did you leave Rutba?
[18:56] if not about yourself, then at least you should have thought about me
[19:17] what do you mean? I didn't get it
[19:24] they are about to get married
[19:27] I won't be able to tolerate it
[19:32] how will I live in this house with Rutba?
[19:35] Altamash doesn't even look at me
[19:40] I have nothing left, Khursheed
[20:23] are you going somewhere?
[20:29] I'm going to see that how come an impossible thing become possible
[20:38] I am going to Mehr Ali house
[20:41] Oh... 
[20:42] Shall I come along?
[20:46] I am feeling scared to carry myself with me
[20:56] if its in my control, then I shall leave away my eyes, ears & tongue everything over here
[21:12] that person is a fool, who takes an entire life to make an impossible thing possible 
[21:28] anyways... but now
[21:31] I have controlled myself, I... 
[21:35] I am fine, I am leaving
[21:41] take care of yourself
[22:02] Rutba, you cannot do this. Uncle's everything is only mine
[22:09] are you listening? Are you getting my point?
[22:18] did you hear me, Altamash?
[22:31] All praise to God... my daughter, my life...
[22:39] finally she is about to become the dignity of my house today
[22:46] All praise to God. Always stay happy & blessed
[22:51] A daughter-in-law should be like her. Who changes everyone's fate as soon as she enters the house
[23:06] Azka... won't you say anything?
[23:17] congratulations to both of you
[23:22] what else can I say?
[23:39] anyways... lets accept your congratulation
[23:45] after all, you've suffered through a lot
[23:50] you've been through so many stages
[24:03] Call the priest
[24:48] come Rutba
[24:50] lets begin our beautiful life
[24:55] lets start the story from the same moment where we had ended it
[25:00] But... I haven't brought my mother's jewelry and the documents of the lands & properties along with me
[25:16] what do you mean? I didn't get it
[25:21] I mean... you are giving me so much
[25:26] the property documents... In fact, you've put Azka's jewelry in my feet
[25:34] But, I have nothing to give you
[25:45] what are you saying?
[25:47] uncle's wealth, bank balance, this house... everything is yours
[25:59] I have given all of it in the trust
[26:09] Whatever you have is enough for me
[26:18] what is this joke, Altamash?
[26:21] have you brought us here to get us humiliated?
[26:28] how is this possible that Rutba shall transfer he everything in someone else's name without our permission?
[26:37] We are here to wed off Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[26:42] not some orphan girl!
[27:00] Rutba, you cannot do this. Uncle's everything is only mine
[27:07] are you listening? Are you getting my point?
[27:16] did you hear me, Altamash?
[27:21] how does a slap sounds when fate slaps on a person's face
[27:37] what were you thinking?
[27:40] that I will be dreaming of spending my life with a disgusting man like you
[27:58] I will bring my everything to you, in order to spend my life with such a conservative & disgusting person?
[28:13] I never used to think that you are so fool
[28:25] how can I see the dreams of living with you, Altamash?
[28:33] Khursheed had taught me the real meaning of dreams
[28:47] Khursheed told me the real value of living a life
[28:58] that value isn't wealth, house, properties or lands
[29:06] that value is conscience
[29:09] if one's conscience is satisfied
[29:13] the satisfaction of its soul, respect...
[29:28] if I have truly loved someone in my life
[29:35] then its Khursheed
[29:51] what is your worth?
[29:54] that I will bring along my everything to spend my life with you
[30:14] Rutba
[30:17] you aren't doing the right thing
[30:26] what have I done as of yet?
[30:29] I haven't done anything as of yet, Altamash
[30:38] that moment is in front of my eyes like a deep wound
[30:49] when you had insulted my respectful father for no reason, and had divorced me
[31:15] Rutba Mehr Ali Khan spits on your fake love, and on your conservative thinking
[31:23] get lost from here!
[31:25] because today, Rutba Mehr Ali Khan has taken her father's revenge
[31:42] get lost!
[31:46] Rutba...
[31:49] Altamash!
[31:57] how dare you to talk about marriage with my wife in my absence?
[32:19] your wife?
[32:22] you have divorced her
[32:34] he has divorced you, right?
[32:40] I will pull out your tongue if you will utter any such word again
[32:49] She is my wife, and she will remain my wife
[32:58] get lost from here!
[33:19] enough is enough! lets go Bazil
[33:48] you haven't done the right thing, Rutba
[33:51] you deserve it!
[35:01] I will remember your each & every favor
[35:05] I will never forget
[35:11] I did enmity with you in my entire life
[35:16] but today, you've taught me the biggest lesson of my life
[35:24] Rutba, you have taught me that...
[35:28] an actual person is that one who cares about his enemy as well
[35:47] please forgive me
[35:50] do you still have a doubt?
[35:52] please...
[35:56] Stay happy & happily married in your house with your husband
[36:50] Khursheed!
[36:54] what did you just said?
[36:59] you really like to create a scene, and insulting people!
[37:05] you didn't even think of your father once?
[37:08] I did all this to take the revenge of my father's grief
[37:17] whatever I did with them, they deserve it!
[37:22] I don't think so that I have done anything wrong
[37:25] You use your father's name in order to calm down the fire of your hatred
[37:31] you should be ashamed
[37:34] after deceiving people, doing false promises of wedding & gathering so many people. Then you say that you did all this for your father!
[37:42] No...
[37:43] you did all of this to satisfy your false ego
[37:48] and for that you had lied big time that I am feeling ashamed while thinking of it
[37:54] lie?
[37:58] which lie have I told?
[38:03] tell me, which lie?
[38:04] why did you tell everyone that I had divorced you?
[38:15] answer me!
