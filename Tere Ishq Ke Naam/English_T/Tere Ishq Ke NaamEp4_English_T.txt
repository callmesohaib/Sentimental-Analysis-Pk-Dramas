[01:01] hi!
[01:06] Azka... when did you come?
[01:09] just now
[01:12] aunty told me that your mood is off because of uncle & Rutba
[01:18] right now uncle is standing on the verge of ego & pride
[01:23] and from there you seem very small to him
[01:25] and this wrong! He should be respecting you
[01:30] and Rutba! She is just like him, as she is his daughter
[01:33] spoiled & bull head, she doesn't understand anything. Nor does she care about anything
[01:40] if I would have been at her place
[01:43] then I would have created a chaos
[01:47] its easy to fall in love but... 
[01:51] its very difficult to fulfill it
[02:15] Altamash, please tell me if I can do something to end your restlessness
[02:20] I want to see yours & Rutba's successful love story
[02:32] will you be able to do whatever I will ask you to do?
[02:35] yes
[02:41] you have to give this to Rutba
[02:44] uncle has switched off her phone
[02:47] be careful that nobody gets to know
[02:55] remember one thing
[02:58] you will always find me very near to you in your life
[03:04] thank you!
[03:34] Azka
[03:37] do you know how to do the work?
[03:40] don't you worry! I know all
[03:50] oh! Mr. Khar... I mean Khursheed. How are you?
[03:55] I hope your life is going very well
[03:58] one should pray to stay safe from such ease that shall free a person from humanity
[04:04] I've heard that a few heights reduces a person's weight
[04:08] what are you trying to say, I did get it
[04:12] closed door can be knocked, but they cannot be opened forcefully
[04:18] the doors are always opened from inside
[04:21] and then its very important for a person to be wise to understand anything
[04:25] try reading books in your leisure time
[04:27] this way all the locks in your mind will get opened
[04:40] He thinks himself as Aflatoon by reading a few books
[04:44] Khar.. (donkey)
[04:50] believe me brother, my heart is bleeding
[04:55] I can't believe
[04:57] how dare Altamash to misbehave with you
[05:03] honestly, I am feeling so disappointed
[05:06] and sister Sanober.. 
[05:09] sister should have taken care of your status & order
[05:14] you have been so lenient to them
[05:17] if someone else would have been in your place then he would have broken the engagement there & then
[05:21] When those people don't value the blood relation, then what's the importance of such a weak relation?
[05:32] Ronaq, I am a realist & that person who makes thoughtful decisions
[05:38] Neither I make or break relations while being emotional
[05:43] if future paths are decided then I am in the favor of ignoring such childish things which becomes an obstacle
[05:54] drink tea
[06:11] Altamash I love you!
[06:13] All love for Altamash
[06:16] this girl won't get anything?
[06:19] In love, more than half of the work is done by the secret keepers
[06:24] thank you!
[06:26] Ok please, go & see what if somebody comes. Until then let me call Altamash
[06:31] Oh, now I have to give the duty of the guard as well. Fine!
[06:35] be quick
[06:37] thank you!
[06:41] Altamash, don't know what had happened to dad
[06:45] don't know why he has kept me inside my house as a prisoner
[06:51] Rutba, listen to me very carefully
[06:56] for now, don't go against uncle
[06:58] he shouldn't doubt a bit about what are we planning, otherwise if will be more difficult for you to leave from there
[07:04] the more stubborn you'll be, the more strictness uncle will show
[07:08] then tell me, what shall I do?
[07:11] first of all, stay relax
[07:14] for now, do whatever uncle is asking you to do
[07:17] after that we'll think what needs to be done
[07:20] Okay, as you say
[07:29] Okay brother, allow me to leave
[07:33] from here I'll go to sister Sanober's house for sure
[07:36] I will talk to her that her behavior isn't right
[07:44] Azka, how is Rutba?
[07:47] is she cheered up?
[07:48] yes uncle, all praise to God she is very happy & absolutely fine
[07:52] what is she doing?
[08:00] uncle, please don't take my name
[08:03] but she...
[08:06] She is talking to Altamash on the phone
[08:07] on the phone?
[08:10] from where did she got the phone?
[08:12] I didn't ask her, you may ask her yourself
[08:16] mom, lets go we are getting late
[08:18] yes... brother we are really getting late
[08:23] please don't say anything to Rutba, she is a young blood
[08:26] in fact, do investigate from sister Sanober & Altamash
[08:32] that why are they provoking our Rutba against her father
[08:38] I'm leaving, bye!
[09:14] yes uncle, did you call me?
[09:17] yes, sit Khursheed
[09:26] Khursheed, I had to visit the lands for a few days
[09:33] but I am worried about Rutba
[09:36] I don't know why I am so worried for the first time while leaving her alone
[09:45] uncle, if you say so then I will visit the land
[09:52] No, I have to go
[09:56] I have to make a few decisions related to my will
[10:03] maybe it can take a week's time but...
[10:07] Rutba won't be knowing it
[10:10] We have to tell her that I will be back within a few days
[10:15] As you think better, uncle
[10:17] don't worry, whatever responsibility you'll give me I'll try my best to fulfill it with honesty
[10:23] I know even if you don't say it
[10:27] I wish, I had the same trust & belief on my own child
[10:36] if one loses trust from their own child then...
[10:38] the sympathies & consoling from the entire world cannot end that pain which
[10:46] a father feels
[11:11] greetings dad!
[11:12] greetings to you too!
[11:23] thank you!
[11:28] where are you going, Rutba?
[11:31] dad, I thought to go to the university
[11:38] what's the reason behind this sudden change?
[11:43] last night I had thought a lot
[11:45] then I thought, if the completion of my graduation can solve the matters of two families then why not?
[11:54] its a matter of a few years only
[11:56] they will pass
[11:59] but I cannot upset you
[12:02] few years?
[12:04] but you weren't ready to spend even a few hours without Altamash
[12:12] dad, don't you trust my words?
[12:16] I do trust your words
[12:19] words are nice
[12:22] but dear, how shall I trust you?
[12:29] until yesterday you were confronting me
[12:32] you were ready to forget your father's life time love & affection to get Altamash
[12:44] dad, I'm really sorry
[12:47] maybe I had said so wrong while being emotional
[12:52] I'm very sorry
[12:54] but I know that you love me so much that you cannot stay upset with me for long time
[13:03] Rutba, sometimes its very painful to know this
[13:09] take care
[13:17] dad, shall I go to university?
[13:23] Khursheed
[13:29] yes uncle?
[13:31] sit
[13:43] Khursheed
[13:45] its your responsibility to pick & drop Rutba from the university
[13:52] Ok
[13:54] and Rutba will not go outside the house in my absence
[13:59] no matter how important the work is
[14:04] all Rutba's work is your responsibility until I come back
[14:11] I don't trust anyone
[14:21] Ok uncle
[14:23] have breakfast
[14:30] for now, don't go against uncle
[14:33] he shouldn't doubt a bit about what are we planning, otherwise if will be more difficult for you to leave from there
[14:47] as you wish, dad
[15:07] dad is going for how many days?
[15:09] I don't know, he hasn't told me
[15:12] didn't he tell you?
[15:14] why?
[15:15] you do a lot of hard work to come near him
[15:18] sometimes I feel jealous of you
[15:23] instead of being jealous if you do some hard work then you'll be able to feel uncle's love as well
[15:29] even he wants the same
[15:31] I am doing hard work to fulfill his desires
[15:35] and for that, if I have to study from you then I will do it
[15:39] do teach me that
[15:42] if I have to win someone's blind trust
[15:44] and that too so much that he shall gets against his only child
[15:50] how to do it. Ok?
[15:52] nobody can teach anyone how to love & how to feel it
[15:57] emotions aren't copied
[16:33] its so difficult to tolerate you
[16:36] but still I am doing it
[16:37] Its Okay, one needs to tolerate
[16:41] somebody has to tolerate more or less
[16:44] its your class time
[17:21] No body knows how much the distance is between life & death
[17:27] but when the burden starts increasing on the heart, and breathing slows down
[17:34] shoulders become heavy & the walk becomes lazy then...
[17:38] a person should get free from a few responsibilities
[17:42] I am also going to lessen some burden
[17:45] brother, I always pray to God about your healthy & long life
[17:51] thank you, Rasheeda
[17:53] may God bless you
[17:56] you & Khursheed are a big blessing for me
[18:00] if I have some ease in my life then its just because of you two
[18:04] I've given a few important orders to Khursheed about Rutba
[18:10] I don't need to say anything special to you but...
[18:13] I cannot stay without telling you
[18:18] Rasheeda, take very good care of Rutba
[18:22] yes yes brother, why not?
[18:24] she is such an innocent & naive girl
[18:30] I'm leaving
[18:31] *farewell*
[19:09] what are you thinking, sister? You seem lost in your deep thinking
[19:13] hmm...
[19:16] isn't Altamash getting so emotional?
[19:21] what if he ruins everything. Brother Mehr's attitude can change anytime
[19:27] you know his thinking is deeper than the dea
[19:32] its hard to understand him
[19:35] hmm... but my dear sister
[19:39] first of all, whether brother is deeper than the sea or harder like rocky isle
[19:46] he is like a sand wall when it comes to his daughter's matter
[19:49] and second thing is that there is a specific time to push the sand wall
[19:56] what if we kept on thinking & others win
[20:02] are you talking about Rasheeda?
[20:04] yes... who else?
[20:07] you know, that mother son duo has completely controlled brother
[20:12] and I'm telling you whatever I saw
[20:16] So, are you also in a favor to take the abrupt step just like Altamash?
[20:19] yes... wise people say, there is no use of crying over spilt milk
[20:25] its better that a person shall beat their head in despair
[20:29] yes?
[21:00] very nice! it means you've got the permission to go outside your house
[21:03] what kind of permission? This Khursheed has kept an eye on me like a body guard
[21:08] until I entered the university, he kept standing outside
[21:11] and now when I'll go out, he will be present there before me
[21:15] I have to study from him after going home & have to listen to his rubbish talks
[21:19] I've become fed up of him. I feel like breaking his face
[21:25] We'll break his face as well as the restrictions imposed by uncle, my love
[21:29] We'll tell him that we are more wise & intelligent than him without getting the degrees
[21:35] Straightforwardness with the straightforward, crookedness with the crooked
[21:40] Rutba, be ready
[21:44] you have to leave from there any day all of a sudden
[21:46] but Altamash, it is not possible at all. How?
[21:52] the matter is not about Khursheed only, dad has forbidden the guards too
[21:57] how dare the guards shall stop Rutba Ali Khan, when she is called by Altamash
[22:02] Altamash, if we'll go against my dad then we can bear a big loss
[22:06] you know how stubborn my father is
[22:09] Rutba, I know it very well when, what & how to get something from uncle
[22:16] just do as I am asking you to do
[22:19] Ok my class is about to start. I'll talk to you later
[22:26] my love, a new life is also about to start
[22:29] just have some patience
[22:33] bye!
[23:20] mom, please bring tea. My students will be here anytime
[23:29] here you go dear
[23:32] tea
[23:40] what happen?
[23:41] nothing! just a thinking came into my mind
[23:45] Rutba was going to the university with you so obediently in the morning
[23:52] both of you were looking so good
[23:54] how quietly she sat inside the car when you had opened the car's door
[23:59] mom, how shall I tell you that how much restlessness was there behind this obedience
[24:06] IF I ever have some time then I will explain you everything
[24:10] but still Khursheed, she is the memorable of my only sister
[24:15] she was the apple of her eye
[24:17] mom she is that star which can show you the stars in the day time as well
[24:20] Sajida used to say that when Khursheed will become a big officer after completing his education...
[24:23] no matter what Khursheed Hasan becomes after completing his education
[24:27] your sister's desire won't be fulfilled ever
[24:38] the sparkle in your eyes & smile on your lips is quite precious to me
[24:44] I won't let it ruin so easily
[24:47] try to see true dreams
[24:53] the kids are about to come, so I am leaving
[24:59] Khursheed, the dreams can lie
[25:02] but eyes doesn't lie
[25:04] no matter how much you hide it from me
[25:06] but a mother hears each & every beating of their child's heart
[25:11] what will you hide from me & how much?
[25:42] greetings sir!
[25:43] greetings to you too Asmat Khan, how are you?
[25:45] thanks to God & to you too
[25:47] the lunch is ready, if you say so then shall I serve it?
[25:49] I am not hungry Asmat Khan, make me some tea
[25:51] please come, lawyer
[25:57] yes... how are you Nisar?
[26:00] all are you prayers, Sir
[26:02] Nisar, this time I've come with some special intention
[26:07] I personally need to check some land related matters & properties details
[26:12] I've brought the lawyer as well, as I've to transfer a few properties as well
[26:17] on Rutba's name?
[26:20] Nisar, I've named my entire life on Rutba. What else do I have to do?
[26:25] Right now I want to gift a few properties to Khursheed Hasan
[26:30] I was thinking that its good if this work is done in my life, after death...
[26:33] God forbid sir, please don't say this
[26:36] may God bless you with healthy & long life. A lot of families are running because of you
[26:46] Nisar, do inform everyone about tomorrow morning
[26:50] We'll visit the lands as I've to make a few important decisions
[26:54] Okay, let me get your room ready until you drink tea
[27:00] please come
[27:13] Rutba seems to be very clever, just like uncle
[27:18] what do you mean?
[27:20] I mean, she was assuring you on the call that she'll do everything as per your consent
[27:26] but as soon as you had disconnected the call, her attitude changed
[27:29] she said, I won't do anything against my father's consent
[27:38] Rutba said this to you?
[27:41] yes, absolutely!
[27:57] what is this?
[28:18] it absorbs air...
[28:20] I am not so free that I shall wait for you to get free
[28:24] I have to prepare my assignment too
[28:29] sit
[28:31] these are the topics & references too
[28:35] I want my assignment today
[28:38] all of you make the notes & give me 2 minutes. I'm coming, Ok?
[29:17] Ok boys, I would be needing some time from all of you
[29:20] you can ask me whatever questions you have, I will tell you
[29:23] And... exercise 2A of 2nd chapter
[29:27] there are few questions in it, start writing their answers
[29:30] just give me 5 to 10 minutes to complete this, then I'll get back to you all Ok?
[29:41] Sir, are you fine?
[30:00] Khursheed
[30:03] dear, first eat your dinner otherwise it will get cold. You can do the work later
[30:08] No mom, some incomplete work turns into allegations
[30:12] let me complete them first
[30:14] So that there won't be an allegation
[30:15] there isn't any big deal about the dinner, I can eat it cold as well
[30:23] Rutba dear you! come sit
[30:27] I don't have time to sit, aunty
I just came to take my assignment
[30:31] I've made rice pudding, let me get it for you
[30:34] Okay
[30:44] hey! what is this?
[30:47] at least open a book for the reference
[30:49] one needs reference to fill the papers when their mind is empty
[30:54] but thanks God my mind is not empty
[31:00] you must have heard that empty mind is a devil's house
[31:04] that's why you get devilish ideas
[31:06] such as irritating someone, annoying someone, or to make someone fall
[31:11] and those people who laugh after making someone fall, should think about their low class thinking
[31:17] a person's respect doesn't reduce by falling, Rutba
[31:21] but it lessens for sure by making someone else fall
[31:25] Khursheed
[31:32] why don't you keep your difficult word with you?
[31:37] or share this with your students
[31:40] being my teacher can be really expensive for you
[31:45] you must have got an idea
[31:48] you are absolutely correct!
[31:50] it can be difficult for anyone to become your teacher
[31:54] when a dish is empty then the person filling it needs to do the same hard work
[31:59] and unfortunately if that dish has a hole
[32:06] then the teacher is gone!
[32:21] where are you going my dear? I've brought the rice pudding
[32:24] No aunty, I am not in a mood right now some other time
[32:27] mom, give it to me
[32:29] Besides the things made with hard work should be given to hard working people
[32:33] As it is, its me who do everyone's work
[32:41] wow mom! its so delicious
[33:25] Greetings, madam Ronaq
[33:26] Greetings to you too Nisar, how are you?
[33:29] I'm fine, madam Ronaq. Is everything alright since you have called me at this hour
[33:33] yes, actually I am unable to contact brother
[33:37] I wanted to ask about his well being that's why I have called you
[33:41] yes yes, he is absolutely fine
[33:43] its just that he got tired due to his long journey that's why he had gone to sleep a bit early
[33:46] Okay
[33:48] until when he'll get free from the work he came for?
[33:52] madam Ronaq, it will take a few days as he has to meet with a few people
[33:56] hmm... I hope land related matters are fine
[34:00] yes, thank God
[34:04] brother must have taken the lawyer along with him, right?
[34:07] yes, he has brought the lawyer along with him as he has to complete all the transfer related matters
[34:12] on whose name? Is he transferring them on Rutba's name?
[34:15] Ronaq madam, I don't know much about it
[34:18] it would be better if you can discuss this with sir
[34:22] hmm.. okay, bye!
[34:25] bye!
[34:32] he cannot transfer anything in Rutba's name in such a hurry
[34:39] then for what he had gone!
[34:42] brother is thinking something else
[34:45] anyways... even if Nisar doesn't tell me
[34:49] Still I will get to know
[35:13] I will go with the driver
[35:14] one second!
[35:16] I will do as uncle has asked me to do
[35:19] if you don't want to consider me as your teacher, then don't. But consider me as your driver
[35:25] come sit, we are getting late
[36:01] greetings uncle! how are you?
[36:05] greetings to you too! I'm fine, dear Khursheed. How are you?
[36:11] And how is Rasheeda?
[36:14] Thank God uncle, all well... I am on my way to drop Rutba to the university
[36:19] very nice! Make me speak to Rutba
[36:23] yes
[36:29] hello dad, greetings! How are you?
[36:32] greetings to you too! How is my lovely daughter?
[36:35] I'm fine, but Khursheed annoys me a lot
[36:38] he taunts me at all times
[36:41] he says that I don't know how to study, and I cannot study anything. I am dull-headed
[36:44] nothing gets absorb in my brain, I am so goofy
[36:48] Besides, he thinks that he is very clever & intelligent than me as he has studied a bit more
[36:56] dad, are you laughing?
[36:59] No, no dear... I am not laughing at all
[37:03] I will scold him
[37:05] that how can he annoy my such an intelligent & wise daughter, how can he make fun of her
[37:12] by reading a few books does he think that he has become more intelligent than Rutba Ali
[37:17] yes
[37:19] dear, let me come back then I will do whatever you want me to do
[37:22] but for now do as I've asked you to do, Ok?
[37:26] dad...
[37:28] dad, I don't want Khursheed to teach me
[37:33] Rutba listen, I'm sitting at the same place where your mother & I used to drink our morning tea
[37:40] your mother used to say, "my daughter will be well educated"
[37:45] "she will become a wise & an educated daughter"
[37:49] your mother was fond of studying
[37:52] even today her books are decorated inside the cupboard
[37:55] dear, people die & leave this world but...
[37:58] their likes & hobbies becomes the decoration of the cupboard & make us realize
[38:05] that what was the caliber of the person who had died
[38:08] Ok dear listen! Don't irritate Khursheed Hasan a lot, it doesn't look good
[38:17] Okay dear, I'm hanging up now. Bye!
[38:20] yes dad, bye!
[39:08] listen! don't know why dad has imposed you on me? When will I get rid of you
[39:13] its your class time, you can taunt me on your way back
[39:17] you are more concerned about my class than me
[39:20] why don't you say that you'll keep standing here until I go inside
[39:23] its a good thing that you are a teacher, guard & driver too. Wow!
[39:28] I want your betterment Rutba
[39:30] and if you can understand then there is a difference between imprisonment & protection
[39:34] listen Khursheed, you are just a sand wall for me
[39:38] whenever I would like to go anywhere, you won't be able to stop me
[39:42] therefore, keep your concern & care with you
[39:48] and you also listen to me
[39:52] uncle's word is final verdict for me
[39:55] and if you won't listen to his order
[39:57] then it will be very difficult for you to leap over this sand wall
