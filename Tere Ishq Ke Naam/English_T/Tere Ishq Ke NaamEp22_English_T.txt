[00:14] by the way, you showed such a hurry
[00:19] it takes a bit of time for the spark to become a fire
[00:27] but you came to see the spectacle immediately
[00:34] I am so disappointed, by the way
[00:45] I am going back home
[00:48]  I have called the car, the driver is here
[00:52] We will go together
[00:55]  uncle is in the hospital, he got a heart attack
[00:59] we have to go immediately
[01:42] I...
[01:46] I know you are distressed...
distressed?
[01:51] distress is a very small word
[01:54] it cannot explain one's condition
[01:58] that's why its better for you not to talk about distress
[02:03] Besides, whatever I have seen & heard is enough for life time
[02:11] but sometimes the matters stays unclear
[02:17] whatever we see & hear is not the complete truth
[02:23] Rutba, truth of lie is not my topic anymore
[02:31] whatever Tazmeen has said that...
please!
[02:36] don't take Tazmeen's name now
[02:45] don't you have a little space for me in your heart?
[02:50] whether its my heart or my life
[02:53] everything has become empty
[02:57] as if I was seeing a dream, and all of a sudden my eyes got opened and now I am standing all alone
[03:05] I thought you are Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[03:09] but you are the reason of his every sorrow & grief
[03:14] I wish that before meeting Altamash you... 
enough!
[03:22] we won't discuss Altamash anymore as well
[03:29] if we don't have anything in between us
[03:33] then we won't discuss on this topic as well
[03:38] staying quiet is better
[03:43] much better
[03:49] thanks for easing the future destinations
[03:54] also, the place where you have brought me
[03:58] thanks for bringing me to that
[04:21] have you informed my mother about uncle's health?
[04:24] her number is not connecting, also she had told us that there is a signal problem in the village
[04:28] I tried calling her many times but her number is not connecting
[04:32] anyways, go bring something to eat from the hospital's canteen & give it in ma'am Rutba's room
[04:38] She didn't had breakfast in the morning as well
[04:40] there is no need of it
[04:46] until dad doesn't gain back conscious I won't eat anything
[04:49] Rutba
[04:56] bring something to eat
[05:08] dad, how are you?
[05:18] Khursheed
[05:22] yes uncle, are you fine?
[05:27] don't worry about me
[05:30] the sun will not shine always
[05:36] there is a beginning of every journey and
[05:40] an end too...
[05:49] dad, why do you say such things?
[05:52] its the sun's work to shine
[05:56] otherwise, everywhere will be only darkness 
[06:04] Khursheed... send Rutba home
[06:15] she must be tired
[06:18] I am also grown very tired
[07:11] distress is a very small word
it cannot explain one's condition
[07:15] that's why its better for you not to talk about distress
[07:19] Besides, whatever I have seen & heard is enough for life time
[07:24] whether its my heart or my life
[07:27] everything has become empty
[07:30] as if I was seeing a dream, and all of a sudden my eyes got opened and now I am standing all alone
[07:36] I thought you are Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[07:39] but you are the reason of his every sorrow & grief
[07:49] don't worry about me
[07:52] the sun will not shine always
[07:55] there is a beginning of every journey and
[07:59] an end too...
[10:10] uncle, how are you feeling?
[10:17] everything seems fine when I see you
[10:22] Khursheed
[10:26] promise me one thing
[10:28] order me
[10:31] never leave Rutba
[10:35] otherwise, she will become completely alone in this cruel world
[10:44] the world is very cruel & brutal
[10:51] relations are quite diplomatic & selfish
[11:00] the blood running in the veins is cold & white
[11:07] Rutba is stupid...
[11:11] and not far sighted
[11:17] if she wasn't married to you then
[11:21] it would have been very difficult for me to die, Khursheed
[11:35] may God always bless you with long & healthy life for us
[11:41] I can face every difficulty if I have your support
[11:48] because sometimes I don't feel like staying alive
[11:56] my prayers will always be with you
[12:02] if Rutba is the beating heart inside my chest then
[12:09] you are light of my eyes
[12:17] if you wouldn't have been there then how I would have seen Rutba's face
[12:27] you haven't promised me
[12:30] Rutba's happiness & protection will always be my priority
[12:38] don't you worry
[12:45] thank you dear
[13:22] uncle, if you say so then shall I send the driver to pick up mom?
[13:26] no no Khursheed, there is no need of doing this
[13:30] in fact, there is no need to worry her by telling about my health
[13:39] she has gone there after so long, upon her heart's desire
[13:44] we won't call her back
[13:48] otherwise she will come back after leaving everything
[13:56] let her stay with herself for a few days
[14:01] as you say
[14:08] dad, I will stay here with you
[14:11] I will take care of you, I will serve you until you don't get well
[14:16] and then, when aunt feels like she can come back
[14:21] no dear, how will you stay here Rutba?
[14:26] you have to stay in Hasanabad with Khursheed
[14:32] the time for us to stay together has ended
[14:35] dad!
[14:39] children don't understand this thing
[14:41] uncle...
[14:46] for now you have to stay like our guardian for so many years
[14:52] and Rutba is right, she will stay here for some time with you. Until you don't get fine
[15:01] why Khursheed? Why Rutba will not go to Hasanabad with you?
[15:07] there is a reason for that
[15:08] but first you shall get healthy, then I will tell you everything
[15:12] ok?
[15:13] now do rest, meanwhile let me make an arrangement for your medicines
[15:35] take out the soup in the bowl if its ready
[15:37] yes, its ready
[15:40] Khursheed
[15:45] I am taking the soup to dad's room
[15:49] it would be better if you meet him too
[15:52] yes, I will leave for Hasanabad after meeting him
[16:06] yes yes, Khursheed you may go. Don't worry about me, I am fine
[16:11] in fact, take Rutba along with you
[16:13] you need Rutba here
[16:17] also its appropriate for her to stay with you now
[16:21] the best place for Rutba is your house, your companionship
[16:33] uncle, I am going to the UK for one year
[16:37] I have got a scholarship in the university
[16:41] Okay
[16:46] its a good thing
[16:49] are you going alone?
[16:53] No, other people will also be there
[16:56] Tazmeen will be there as well
[17:10] Khursheed, why aren't you taking Rutba along with you?
[17:16] uncle, what she will do there?
[17:19] day & night I will be busy in studying
[17:25] Khursheed is right dad, what will I do by going there?
[17:29] Besides, I want to stay here with you
[17:33] I don't feel like going anywhere after leaving you
[17:37] dear, some matters are more important in life than one's desires
[17:42] when will you understand?
[17:49] Khursheed.... Rutba will also get something to do over there
[17:55] you have a scholarship, so you cannot afford
[17:59] I will take care of Rutba's expenses
[18:04] take her along, it will be more appropriate
[18:09] I have told you already, I don't want to go anywhere
[18:12] I don't want to go & its decided. I will stay here with you, I won't go anywhere
[18:17] dear, what if I die then... 
oh uncle please...
[18:22] don't say such things
[18:30] now she wants to stay with me when
[18:34] I am not with myself anymore
[18:38] May God bless you with long & healthy life
[18:42] Khursheed... Rutba is stubborn for sure but...
[18:48] she is soft hearted & sensitive too
[18:52] she is very loving but...
[18:55] but she doesn't know how to express it
[19:00] just like white pearls
[19:03] but... she doesn't know how to become a string of beads
[19:11] Khursheed
[19:14] please forgive her mistakes
[19:19] its my desire & hope too
[19:23] the day both of you will understand each other, that day you'll be very happy
[19:39] education will be your weapon
[19:43] nobody will be able to defeat you
[19:48] because a life's battle cannot be won by wealth, properties or money
[19:54] it is won by education & thinking
[20:01] uncle, I had passed every difficulty in my life because of your such words
[20:15] how are you, Nazeera? and Zahida how about you?
[20:19] we are fine Rasheeda, how about you?
[20:22] you came back after so long. Did you like the city so much that you had forgotten the village?
[20:27] what difference does it make, what suited us & what not
[20:32] its just that... life takes away everything in a flow
[20:37] and how can I forget you people, you are my childhood friends
[20:43] I had spent such a good time with you guys
[20:46] we got married together, and then we gave birth to the children together
[20:50] and then everyone went on their paths
[20:53] we are meeting after such a long time, I am feeling so relieved
[20:58] how is Khursheed? He didn't come with you
[21:01] Khursheed teaches in a very big college
[21:04] the way his father used to teach in the high school, the same way
[21:08] by the grace of God He is very intelligent & he has read so many books that we can't count
[21:15] and he got married to Rutba, Sajida's daughter
[21:18] I had sent the sweetmeats to you people, in fact I had sent them to the entire village
[21:21] yes yes, we know. Okay tell us, how is your daughter-in-law?
[21:25] All praise to God, very pretty. She is way too beautiful
[21:30] she is just like a full moon
[21:32] Rasheeda, since she is the daughter of a rich man. I hope she isn't arrogant & ill-mannered
[21:48] your dialed number cannot be reached at the moment, please try again later
[21:54] mom, at least you should have told me before leaving
[22:15] why didn't you tell me about your UK plan?
[22:21] because I couldn't decide whether I should go or not
[22:28] leaving seems difficult to me
[22:35] and now staying here seems difficult
[22:50] you shall go
[22:58] I won't stop you
[23:01] neither I will come after you, nor I will signify any right on you
[23:10] you are free to make your decisions
[23:21] I am happy that Tazmeen is going with you
[23:31] it seems as if both of you are meant for each other
[23:41] and you?
[23:50] leave thinking about me
[23:53] now just think about yourself
[24:01] you...
[24:06] you shall marry Tazmeen
[24:14] I am sure that both of you will live happily together
[25:35] come Rutba, sit
[25:54] where is Khursheed?
[25:58] dad...
[26:02] don't insist me to go with Khursheed
[26:08] he is going abroad for studies
[26:12] I was thinking to join the university once again, by staying here
[26:19] I shall complete my education, after all you wanted this
[26:24] tell me something, Rutba
[26:27] honestly...
[26:30] yes
[26:32] why do you meet Altamash?
[26:44] who told you?
[26:46] this is not the answer to my question
[26:54] I won't lie
[26:59] I will tell the truth
[27:05] Altamash came to Hasanabad
[27:11] I had met him as well
[27:14] but nothing as such happened, due to which you had to face the problems once again
[27:18] you are naive, Rutba
[27:25] I shiver by thinking about it, and you are talking about worries
[27:35] does Khursheed knows about it?
[27:46] Rutba listen
[27:48] there is a lot of difference between a father's heart & a husband's heart
[27:52] the same difference between sea & stream
[27:58] Khursheed shouldn't know about it
[28:02] and next time if you do any such stupidity
[28:05] then just think that we can only give justifications to alive people
[28:09] dad
[28:10] dead people, take away all the worries & desires along with them
[28:19] then even the tears of repentance doesn't reach them
[28:25] nor justifications
[28:36] dad
[28:40] you haven't answered me
[28:43] who told you that I had met Altamash?
[28:49] I don't know
[28:52] I got a few pictures from an unknown number
[29:12] oh Tazmeen..
[29:30] travel safe, Khursheed
[29:33] its Mehr Ali's biggest desire to see his children on the highest position
[29:40] and what can be more joyous to look at the dreams coming true from an open eyes
[29:47] Khursheed, one day you'll shine like a horizon in your life
[30:06] your thinking will be your light, Khursheed
[30:10] due to which you'll see every path very clearly
[30:17] and education will be your weapon
[30:20] nobody will be able to defeat you
[30:25] because a life's battle cannot be won by wealth, properties or money
[30:32] it is won by education & thinking
[30:38] uncle, I had passed every difficulty in my life because of your such words
[30:43] this head would never be high, if you hadn't supported me
[30:48] Rutba, go & see off Khursheed. Say bye to him
[30:54] no uncle, there is no need of it. I will go
[30:59] there is need, Khursheed
[31:02] a person who bids farewell, then he steps on the path of saying welcome
[31:11] it is waiting that works as a bridge between the heart of two people
[31:17] go Rutba
[31:20] bid farewell to Khursheed
[31:28] Go Rutba
[31:30] tell Khursheed that you'll wait for him
[31:38] okay dad, please drink this soup
[31:55] I shall take your leave now. Bye!
[31:58] bye!
[32:24] why are you bothering yourself?
[32:27] although you already know that neither good bye or welcome will make any difference
[32:32] I am not that immature or fool
[32:37] who believes on such words as "wait"
[32:40] or maybe I don't know the difference between temporary or permanent separation
[32:47] and neither I am so selfish & poor-spirited
[32:51] I am just compelled due to the trust that uncle has on me
[32:57] I have said to you that you are not compelled
[33:03] take a flight as much as you want to
[33:08] don't think that you have any sort of chains in your feet
[33:16] are you making this environment compatible for yourself or for me?
[33:26] Khursheed go
[33:30] somebody must be waiting for you
[33:38] greetings aunt!
greetings! how are you my daughter?
[33:43] I saw you after such a long time, I feel so relieved now
[33:48] greetings aunt!
greetings! how are you? Stay blessed
[33:54] what happen to you my dear? You used to be so sparkling, why you have become so dull?
[33:59] it seems as if you have been effected by something
[34:04] are you happy?
[34:06] yes aunty, I am very happy & satisfied too
[34:12] how are you all?
[34:14] very good, very happy.. so happy as if we've got everything in our life
[34:21] oh! how are you Mr. Khar.... Umm....
[34:26] I mean Khursheed?
[34:29] by the grace of God I am absolutely fine
[34:31] and capable enough to speak all the words properly
[34:35] here people doesn't even learn to speak property even if they spend a life time
[34:43] I feel sorry for such thinking, as well as for such life
[34:49] anyways, dad is inside the room. Please go & sit with him, meanwhile let me see off Khursheed
[34:58] let's go!
[36:34] brother, may you be blessed with my life as well
[36:38] I pray that we shall always have your shadow on our head
[36:42] believe me, I feel so upset to see you in this condition
[36:46] Sanober & I were praying a lot for you
[36:52] brother, you could have asked someone to call us as well. Then we would have come to you running
[36:58] yesterday manager Nisar told us that you got a heart attack & that too a serious one
[37:10] Rutba, dear you could have called us once
[37:14] at least we would have been informed
[37:17] however, we cannot expect anything good from Rasheeda
[37:22] Sanober, there is no need to bad mouth about Rasheeda
[37:28] that poor woman has gone to her village, she doesn't know anything
[37:32] Besides, that naive woman is capable enough that we shall praise her in her absence too
[37:41] as far as the heart is concerned then...
[37:44] if it stops working then only can only rely on God or hospital
[37:52] and thanks to God, I have availability of both
[37:57] God forbid brother, if its in my control then I shall take out my heart & keep it in front of you
[38:03] you don't know, what we are going through while seeing you in this condition
[38:08] how are you guys?
[38:11] by the grace of God, we are absolutely fine
[38:15] There is a good news! mom has come to give Arfa's wedding card. Arfa's wedding has been fixed
[38:23] all praise to God, congratulations!
[38:26] really!
[38:29] Ronaq you had never discussed about it earlier
[38:31] brother, actually everything happened all of a sudden
[38:36] the day they had brought the proposal, the same day they had fixed the wedding date
[38:42] Arfa dear, come to me
[38:51] ok tell me
[38:54] are you happy with this proposal?
[38:55] brother, why she won't be happy? She is very happy.
 actually the proposal is of her liking
[39:01] All praise to God!
[39:04] Rutba, go & check on the lunch arrangements. As your aunts came over after such a long time
[39:11] go dear
[39:13] Okay dad
come on
