[00:54] Where is Mr. Khursheed?
[00:58] I don't know
[01:04] If you permit, can we sit for a while? We are here for a short time
[01:28] Greetings! Sir, why are you standing here? Come sit
[01:32] Mr. Khursheed Hassan, first put the stuff
[01:36] I'll take it. I'll put it in kitchen
[02:09] Khursheed Hassan, you have upset your wife in an empty house?
[02:13] You are proven so dumb
[02:16] No sir, actually ..
[02:18] This is the only result comes out to go on shopping without your wife
[02:23] Be thankful that we reached otherwise all these eggs and tomatoes were being used on you
[02:32] Mr. Khursheed, our plan was to surprise you so we have already arranged evening tea
[02:42] Thank you!
[02:44] I'll serve tea to everyone then
[02:47] I'll help you
[02:49] Come
[02:52] Come sit
[05:37] Come, please sit
[05:50] I'm thankful to you
[05:54] Let it go. I didn't do any such thing
[05:58] Haven't you heard, Good friend helps you at the right time. Also, we are neighbors
[06:07] You considered me your friend, I'm thankful
[06:14] Why is Rutba upset with you?
[06:18] Sorry, that I'm asking you a personal question. But how can someone be upset with you?
[06:31] They get upset with people like me
[06:36] Who can't be upset in return
[06:46] Is it love marriage?
[06:53] If I am reborn ..
[06:58] even then Rutba won't like me
[07:02] Yes, but you like her. There is no denial in that
[07:11] Let this little pride left inside me
[07:25] No! I don't like her right now
[07:32] Please do not ask this question to me again
[08:50] Hello?
[08:54] Auntie, this is Rutba
[08:59] My dear Rutba, my sweetheart
[09:03] how are you, my child?
[09:06] I'm fine and alive. This is why I dialed your number
[09:14] What are you saying my dear? May you live long
[09:20] How's Altamash, auntie?
[09:22] He's better. Doctors are checking him otherwise I would have asked him to talk to you
[09:28] No! It isn't needed.
[09:32] I called to ask for his health. I'll disconnect now
[09:36] Rutba, whose number is this?
[09:42] Its my number but do not call on this number
[09:46] My child, forgive me. We made a huge mistake
[09:51] Altamash is too embarrassed as well.
[09:58] Yes auntie. He has apologized already by getting married to Azka
[10:07] Bye!
[11:42] Listen Rutba
[11:45] You have been sent here as my responsibility
[11:50] You are married to me and are my dignity.
[11:54] And I'm trying hard to give you every thing that is your right
[12:02] But if you will exploit my soft behavior then it is my right to tell you your limits
[12:12] what do you mean?
[12:16] You won't have any relation or contact with Altamash
[12:24] Look Khursheed ..
[12:25] I'm not asking for explanations.
[12:29] I'm clarifying that no matter how inferior I am for you, this marriage wasn't forceful
[12:38] You agreed.
[12:42] Now that you have agreed, then no other man can have a space in your life
[12:50] neither for sympathies nor for mercies.
[12:55] Understood?
[13:18] You both sisters should be ashamed. Look at the way you are fighting.
[13:21] Is this is how you are acting at this moment, how will you act at hard times?
[13:28] Explain her. Ask her to control her tongue or else I'll cut it
[13:34] Azka! What has happened to you?
[13:37] How will you be able to stay with a guy like Altamash if you'd act this emotional?
[13:42] Try to control yourself. Your war has just started. Don't forget that you haven't won the game
[13:49] Mother, this is the reason that I speak too.
[13:54] She has started considering herself something big after uncle gave the ownership of his lands.
[13:57] Shut up or else I'll break your head
[13:59] Azka!
[14:01] Mother, I will talk to this ill-mannered woman after she'd come in her senses
[14:06] Go away! I'm not interested too
[14:14] mom, Why did this happen to me?
[14:19] The most important day of my life is ruined.
[14:26] Do you know all my friends are messaging me and making fun. Everyone is missing Rutba, still
[14:35] Infact, Altamash is calling Rutba's name in hospital.
[14:40] Now I'm getting angry at him too, I'm telling you
[14:45] Calm down. What has happened to you? I'm here. Act sensibly. I'll talk about your marriage.
[14:58] Nothing will happen. I know it well
[15:01] Azka?
[15:14] Come in. Thanks to God that my son has come back home
[15:18] I'll sacrifice goats for my child. Bazil, bring 2 black goats for sacrifice.
[15:26] Yes!
[15:30] May good news come. I'll call Ronak to bring Azka
[15:37] Mother, call Rutba
[15:42] Make me talk to her. I want to listen to her voice
[15:53] Please!
[16:07] How is Altamasha, auntie?
[16:13] Yes auntie, he has already apologized by getting married to Azka
[16:48] I'm clarifying that no matter how inferior I am for you, this marriage wasn't forceful You agreed.
[16:56] Now that you have agreed, no other man can have a space in your life neither for sympathies nor for mercies.
[17:09] What does he think of himself?
[17:12] He'll say few emotional words and I'll listen to him?
[17:18] Its upto me who I talk to or meet.
[17:23] Who is he to stop me?
[17:27] Its my wish
[17:45] I made a huge mistake by telling you that Rutba called to ask about your health
[17:51] No, neither it was you or Rutba who made the mistake.
[17:57] It was uncle who made the mistake by building a huge wall between us
[18:02] I will definitely take the revenge
[18:04] Enough Altamash. Azka has come into your life now.
[18:10] Give her the status she deserves. And stop following Rutba like a greedy lion
[18:16] She has gone far away
[18:18] I know how to increase or reduce the distance
[18:24] Understood?
[18:29] Come Azka! We were talking about you
[18:33] Greetings auntie! How is Altamash now?
[18:37] Are you in pain?
[18:41] mom, I want to rest for a while. Can you please leave me alone
[18:48] He is right. He needs rest. We both will leave. Where is Ronak my child?
[18:55] Mother is with uncle
[18:58] Fine, we'll go to her.
[19:00] Come my child. Lets go downstairs
[19:42] Auntie, these are only 10 clothes. Where are rest of them?
[19:45] My child, brother Mehr has talked to boutique already. They will send rest of them
[19:50] She always does this. You know that I have to go to university. I don't like repeating dresses. Please ask her to send more
[19:57] Look my child
[19:59] What is it?
[20:00] Brother Mehr, no matter what our daughter wears it seems that it is made for her, isn't it?
[20:06] Yes, even if she wears a sac, she'd look good
[20:10] father?
[20:11] My child, they will come. Don't worry
[20:42] You complain from people who change
[20:48] why are you punishing those who are loyal to you since always?
[20:58] whom are you defending? Father or yourself?
[21:14] Look Ms Tazmeen, it is important to keep some relations as happy as you are picking roses from bare hands
[21:24] You do get hurt but no one sees the blood.
[21:29] Because it isn't as precious as rose
[21:32] All I could understand is that fate wants to bring you together.
[21:37] When what fate wants, then do not worry about small differences
[21:42] Small differences?
[21:45] You are insulting my courage and strength both
[21:51] You should at least praise my patience
[21:55] All I can say is that you both would start understanding each other very soon
[22:02] And it won't take long for Rutba to realize that she has got a wonderful man as a life partner
[22:10] I have accepted your praise as a debt
[22:13] Very good
[22:17] I will wait for you to pay this debt
[22:19] Sure!
[22:23] But the condition is that you won't praise me, but Rutba
[22:32] I didn't get you
[22:36] I feel that this wall of pride between you two is made of ice
[22:42] And you need a little praise to melt this ice.
[22:47] I hope that you will ponder on your friend's advice.
[23:08] Greetings madam Rutba
[23:10] Greetings!
[23:12] Sir has sent some stuff
[23:16] for what?
[23:18] I don't know. This is for you and sir Khursheed
[23:27] Take it back and ask father that I don't need his charity
[23:35] Aslam uncle
[23:36] Greetings!
[23:36] Greetings! How are you?
[23:38] Fine
[23:40] Leave this stuff here and you go
[23:43] Haven't you heard? Take it back
[23:50] You go. This will stay here
[24:05] One more thing. Keep this
[24:09] eat something on your way
[24:10] Thank you!
[24:12] Take care
[24:14] Bye sir!
[24:34] Who are you to interfere between me and father?
[24:39] what do you want?
[24:42] what is the limit of your anger or revenge, tell me this?
[24:48] You are hurting uncle so much. And I feel that until you see him dead, you won't get peace
[24:58] Enough!
[25:01] Think a hundred times before saying such thing
[25:04] Focus on your actions, then you won't find my words foolish
[25:09] He isn't well.
[25:13] Mother was telling me that he has called doctor twice at home. He takes care of every happiness of yours, and all you are giving him in return is pain
[25:24] Parents are like gifts.
[25:29] If you do not value them, they find a grave only to lighten up their hearts.
[25:59] I was saying, if you find it appropriate then do Azka's ruksati
[26:04] There is no need of a big celebration. We can arrange a simple event at home
[26:11] I think this is what will happen now.
[26:16] Big celebrations do not suit us. Every time something wrong happens
[26:24] Ronak, what's the rush? The guy has broken his leg.
[26:30] They had put rod in his leg.
[26:33] He is using support to walk and here you want to do the wedding ceremony?
[26:37] Yes brother, you are right
[26:41] But I never thought that Altamash'a and Azka's commitment would prove this lucky.
[26:49] God has blessed our homes very much. We had everything.
[26:53] But see, after wedding my daughter would get ownership of millions.
[27:11] I have to speak something important to you Ronak
[27:15] Yes sister?
[27:18] Look, wedding is done.
[27:20] Altamash wants you to talk to brother Mehr before final wedding ceremony
[27:32] About what sister?
[27:38] Transfer the lands to Altamash's name that Azka has
[27:47] this is Altamash's condition
[28:47] what do you want? what is the limit of your anger or revenge, tell me this?
[28:52] You are hurting uncle so much. And I feel that until you see him dead, you won't get peace
[29:04] What do I do of this father?
[29:12] For whom shall I get ready?
[29:18] Those eyes are upset with me that I wanted to see my reflection in
[29:30] what do I do of this?
[29:44] Those mirrors were dirty that you used to see your reflection in
[29:55] be thankful that you are safe now
[30:00] you should complain about people who change.
[30:06] Why are you punishing those who have always been loyal to you?
[30:16] whom are you defending?
[30:20] Father or your own self?
[30:29] I don't need to defend anyone, Rutba
[30:35] Neither I'm the criminal not uncle.
[30:40] Also, you don't need witnesses when law is blind
[31:25] Brother
[31:28] Sit Rasheeda
[31:32] do not keep thinking so much and burden your heart.
[31:37] Don't you remember what doctor said? Do not take any tension
[31:41] Stay happy
[31:45] You are right Rasheeda,
[31:48] These plants and trees were saying the same to me that Mehr you aren't talking to us these days
[31:59] You are lost in our presence.
[32:04] Rasheeda, two things make a person lonely
[32:12] a lot of wealth and a lot of selfish relations
[32:18] I have both of these
[32:22] May God give long life to daughter Rutba and Khursheed
[32:27] Their relationship becomes filled with love.
[32:30] Then you won't feel lonely, brother. You will be running after grand children then
[32:39] Really Rasheeda? Is it possible?
[32:42] why not brother? Hope for the best.
[32:46] Do not consider yourself weak. God will bless this house with happiness. God wills
[32:53] God willing
[32:56] Rasheeda, you have changed my thoughts.
[33:00] It will be beautiful time when Rutba's and Khursheed's children will be with us.
[33:07] My last days will pass smoothly
[33:11] May God bless you with long life
[33:19] Hello? Greetings! Yes, Ronak?
[33:29] I gave Azka the ownership of the house. Who is he to get the ownership?
[33:36] I'm coming
[34:32] Mr. Khursheed....
[34:36] no matter how many books do you read or get degrees.
[34:43] It is you who has to cook the bread
[34:48] happy wedding
[34:54] I have to do everything here
[38:01] Umm .. Ms. Tazneem called for you
[38:08] Call her back
[39:30] Rutba?
[39:35] What?
[39:36] Come, lets have dinner together
[39:41] I'm not hungry
[39:47] I want to sleep
[40:09] Rut ...
