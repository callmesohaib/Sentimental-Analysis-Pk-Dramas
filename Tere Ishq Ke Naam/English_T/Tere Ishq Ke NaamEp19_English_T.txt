[00:14] Look at my face.
[00:18] My eyes, my nose and my lips are the same.
[00:24] You are sitting as close to me as I am sitting close to you.
[00:28] And I didn't deprive you from your any right.
[01:00] Thank you Rutba.
[01:05] You took good care of me today.
[01:07] More than my expectations.
[01:12] Really?
[01:14] What else do you expect from me?
[01:18] That I am a proud, ill mannered and rude girl.
[01:23] Who doesn't have manners to talk to anyone and doesn't know how to interact with others?
[01:28] Who can't give any favor to others and she doesn't know about the importance of sincerity, adoption and relations. Am I right?
[01:40] I didn't say anything like that.
[01:43] Hmm, but you think like that.
[01:48] You are not Rutba Meher Ali that you say whatever you think.
[01:57] You are Khurshid Hasan.
[02:01] Who bears bitter moments with a smile.
[02:07] I didn't understand one thing.
[02:12] That you are praising yourself and considering me bad or you are praising me and considering yourself bad.
[02:21] Day is a day and night is a night.
[02:26] No matter how much I consider myself worthy of praise.
[02:30] But coming here to you, I have come to know that virtue is that which is recognized by the world.
[02:46] How can I consider you bad?
[02:50] You only have good qualities.
[02:54] That's why whole world praises you.
[03:02] Do you know?
[03:09] Today you are not looking like Rutba Meher Ali but like Meher Ali Khan.
[03:20] I wish.
[03:24] I wish I was like my father.
[03:28] But I am not even like his shadow.
[03:33] This is not the case.
[03:37] Parents are like dense shadows.
[03:42] So how can their children be bare sunlight?
[03:48] Whether you are not like your uncle but there is his image in you and his tone reflects in your tone.
[03:59] He is hiding somewhere inside you but you don't know.
[04:04] You my dad so much. Don't you?
[04:08] But me, despite being her real daughter, I can't express my love for him like this.
[04:17] Now I am realizing that why does dad love you so much.
[04:21] Why?
[04:23] Because you know the skill to win hearts.
[04:28] You make everyone yours.
[04:32] What do you mean by everyone?
[04:36] Everyone.
[04:38] Dad, aunt, Tazmeen, your students and...
And?
[04:46] Is there anyone else, whom I made mine or considered as mine?
[04:55] There is one more name.
[05:00] I will tell you if you ask.
[05:04] Tell me.
[05:11] Well...
[05:16] That
[05:24] That canteen vendor.
[05:26] Whose hand made meal you eat daily.
[05:35] OK
[05:37] This is right as well.
[06:03] I think there is definitely something going on between Altamash and brother.
[06:08] And that is related to you.
[06:11] Mom
[06:13] If Altamash has locked any deal with uncle in my name then I will definitely reveal that.
[06:20] Because then there will be my right on that deal instead of Altamash.
[06:25] I am his wife, he married me with his will and
[06:29] He is not feeling ashamed by blackmailing uncle.
[06:34] Listen Azka
[06:35] If Altamash is getting any benefit from brother then let him do that. In the end whatever he belongs will also be yours.
[06:43] But how mom, he didn't even tell me anything about that.
[06:46] He hides everything from me as if he doesn't believe me. He doesn't trust me.
[06:51] Win his heart as well his trust.
[06:54] Listen, keep an eye of his every matter.
[06:58] Act so wisely that he doesn't know about that but you know about his every matter.
[07:03] Engage the servants of house with you.
[07:06] Listen Azka, I want to see your rule over that house.
[07:23] Right mom.
[07:25] At the moment I just want to know that what is in those files.
[07:49] You?
[07:51] Since how long you are standing here quietly?
[07:56] Why mom.
[07:58] Didn't you like?
[08:02] Why do we talk such things which we want to hide from the whole world?
[08:08] Mom you are not telling Azka ways to rule but to fall from people's sight.
[08:15] And that too to Azka, who always thinks emotionally and negatively.
[08:21] Mom you are showing her the way of destruction by calling it a way of success.
[08:27] What nonsense you are talking? From where you are learning this rudeness?
[08:31] Will you tell your mother that what is right and what is wrong?
[08:35] Why not mom?
[08:36] Mother is also a human, she can make mistakes.
[08:40] The meanings of good and bad don't change, it's humans who needs to change.
[08:46] Get lost. Get lost. Get out of my room. Go.
[08:51] Get lost, don't show me your face again. She will teach me. Huh.
[11:34] Azka
[11:40] Azka open the door.
[12:07] What are you looking at?
[12:09] The most beautiful thing of this room is standing in front of you.
[12:17] Beautiful things don't look good if they are shattered.
[12:25] By the way, remember one thing that doors of this rooms shouldn't be closed ever in my presence.
[12:37] What were you doing which needed to be hid from me as well.
[12:42] Nothing.
[12:44] I fell asleep while waiting for you.
[12:50] Don't take your eyes away like this.
[12:55] Rest is fine.
[12:56] You are right Altamash.
[13:02] You shouldn't take your eyes away on any question.
[13:07] And I hope that this rules applies on both of us.
[13:15] I will be going to visit my lands in the morning so I will have to get up early.
[13:50] Perhaps it would fell out from the file.
[13:54] By the way, why did uncle send factory file to you?
[13:58] Tell me as well.
[14:08] Listen to me carefully Azka.
[14:11] If you will try to interfere in my personal matters then you will never live happily in this house.
[14:21] Other than that, do shopping, go for outings and do whatever you want.
[14:31] If you try to spy on me again, you will neither be able to live in this house nor in my heart.
[14:50] I will do that much to you that you will not find a place to step on the earth.
[14:55] If I don't return this slap to you with the same intensity, then don't call me Azka again.
[15:02] Ronaq, it was your desire that Altamash become your son-in-law.
[15:09] And Azka also considered Rutba as a hindrance in her way because of her desire.
[15:17] No brother, you are thinking wrong, there is no such thing.
[15:22] Azka loves Rutba so much.
[15:27] I have no grievances from you Ronaq, rather I am thankful to both of you.
[15:33] I am just telling you that now it's your job to bind Altamash in relationships.
[15:41] I can give you flute but I can't teach you how to play it.
[15:47] Keep this in mind that I have paid off those debts which were not obligatory for me.
[15:53] Yes brother, I am really thankful to you and pray for you all the times. We don't need anything except your hand on our heads.
[16:04] Ronaq, advise Azka that on her desire, whatever fate has given her she should stand with that whether that turns out to be a flower or an ember.
[16:17] If she stays calm and patient then that ember will turn into a flower some day.
[16:23] Else
[16:24] The skirt must also be sieved and the heart too.
[16:30] Go
[16:32] Learn to live happily.
[16:35] Whatever is happening between me and Altamash just leave that apart.
[16:41] No one will get benefit through bad intentions and impatience.
[16:46] I wanted to make you understand.
[16:49] Yes brother I understood.
[16:52] Thanks brother.
[16:57] Bye
[17:17] Ronaq, you are going so soon?
[17:21] It would be better if you have dinner with us.
[17:26] You are having it Rasheeda, isn't that enough?
[17:30] I didn't understand.
[17:32] If you could understand that then why would it happen?
[17:35] My brother loves you more than me.
[17:40] And why would your value be more and mine is less in this house?
[17:45] You live in this castle like house as a queen but look like a servant.
[17:51] I couldn't adopt such get up Rasheeda.
[17:55] That's why whenever I come here, I count the bitterness of brother's tone and his wrinkles of forehead.
[18:03] But you are fine. Everything is good for you.
[18:38] I believe that we don't find such kind of people again and again.
[18:43] To whom your heart greet with passion and eyes give respect by bowing the head.
[18:52] Miss Rutba, it's not only me who says this rather every resident of this building, lecturers of college, students and principal, everyone likes him so much.
[19:07] The people who are liked in the heavens
[19:12] The same people are liked by everyone in this world as well.
[21:11] I started? It has been started by you Azka.
[21:14] Till you were in this house, you kept making fuss. You like to make noise and fun.
[21:20] Now you have gone there and married to Altamash after so much difficulty even then you are coming here crying out loud.
[21:43] I am really happy to share this news with all of you
[21:48] That our college's overall GPA this year has enabled us to enter the list of this country's top ten colleges.
[21:58] From my side, many many congratulation to all of you honorable teachers.
[22:05] You have worked really hard on your students and I am really happy about that.
[22:12] Well the second good news is that like always we will send our three nominated lecturers to UK to complete their MS on scholarship.
[22:26] We will make announcements at the end of next semester.
[22:31] Now make groups. We will ask different groups to get ready for extra curricular activities like Bone-fire, hiking and camping.
[22:45] Every group will consist of three teachers and thirty students.
[22:58] Thank you.
[23:05] Mama
[23:09] Mama
[23:13] What happened? Is everything alright?
[23:16] Where is mama?
[23:18] She is not at home. What happened now? Tell me.
[23:22] What do you mean by "what happened now"?
[23:27] Altamash beat me.
[23:29] He slapped me.
[23:31] What does he think of himself?
[23:33] He thinks that I am less intelligent, weak and fool like Rutba?
[23:39] It's his misunderstanding.
[23:41] You will see that how will I teach him the lesson?
So it has come to this extent.
[23:48] Just a few days have passed after your marriage Azka.
[23:52] It's not been few months and you. You used to talk about Altamash's love and now you are complaining against him.
[24:00] You have started to taunt me again.
[24:02] I started?
[24:03] It has been started by you Azka, till you were in this house you used to make fuss. You like to make noise and have fun.
[24:12] Now you have gone there after getting Altamash after so much difficulties.
[24:16] Even then you are here crying out loudly.
[24:20] And Rutba? Rutba is not fool and weak.
[24:25] She is living a peaceful life with Khurshid in this small city with patience and thankfulness but you are not satisfied even after getting Altamash.
[24:34] It means that problem is with you.
[24:46] You will not find peace until you disturb me and hurt my heart.
[24:53] Why are you so jealous from me?
[24:55] What qualities do you have? There is no quality in you except jealousy and hatred.
[25:00] You couldn't make room in Altamash's heart so now you have come here to disrupt the peace of our house.
[25:07] Altamash has slapped you. Right?
[25:10] He did right thing.
[25:25] Ah, mama
[25:33] So tell me now, I did right thing by beating you. Hmm.
[25:40] Mama
[25:42] Mama
What happened?
[25:44] What happened?
Mama Azka has beaten me.
[25:49] You have beaten her.
Yes she deserves that.
[25:51] Huh, Rutba's supporter. Get away.
[25:55] Sit here.
[25:56] Saleha
[25:57] Bring first aid kit immediately.
[26:00] Go and bring first aid kit for sister.
[26:03] My foot.
[26:05] Azka
[26:05] She should die.
[26:08] Press it from here. I will bring that. Saleha
[26:18] It's not sufficient to know the routes only, Altamash.
[26:22] The success is to understand the route properly and get to final destination.
[26:30] Animals know the routes much better than us.
[26:36] But there is a difference between humans and animals.
[26:40] Now tell me, what do you want to say?
[26:44] You have given me the documents of Sheikupura's factory.
[26:47] But you didn't transfer in my name.
[26:50] What do I do with those documents?
[26:53] Legally you are still the owner.
You have got the documents.
[26:58] And you are getting the profit as well. As far as ownership is concerned.
[27:03] For that you will have to wait.
Wait for what?
[27:10] Wait for Ronaq and Azka's endorsement.
[27:14] It's not sufficient to keep Azka in your house.
[27:18] You will have to give Azka status of your wife.
[27:21] Ronaq just called me.
[27:26] I am awake.
[27:28] You should also wake up Altamash.
[27:32] It seems that you are still sleeping.
[27:38] You slapped her.
[27:41] If you treat Azka like that then don't get any hope to receive any kindness from me.
[27:51] So aunt have brought her case into your court.
[27:55] Listen to me uncle.
[27:58] Whatever was discussed among was in a legal way.
[28:03] If you will talk about behavior then you will regret so much.
[28:08] Azka is legally my wife and that's it.
[28:13] You will have to fulfill your promise.
[28:17] You will have to transfer ownership of factory to me other wise
[28:20] Otherwise? What do you mean by otherwise?
[28:25] Azka's settlement is a different thing, I won't let Rutba live peacefully.
[28:33] Even today, my voice can deprive her of peace and tranquility.
[28:40] You know this and so do I.
[28:44] If you took the name of Rutba with your dirty tongue
[28:48] Then I will forget Altamash that you are only son of my real sister.
[29:03] If the price of Rutba's tranquility and peace is your blood
[29:10] I won't waste a single minute in taking that.
[29:14] At the moment, you will have to transfer the ownership of Sheikhupura's factory in my name uncle.
[29:19] And as far as my blood's worth then you will have to sell everything you own to pay it's worth.
[29:32] It's a not good match between old bones and young blood.
[29:40] I am leaving.
[30:22] Like always we will send our three nominated lecturers to UK to complete their MS on scholarship.
[30:37] Do I ask one thing from you?
[30:41] Yes, go ahead.
[30:45] If I will have to go somewhere for a specific period then will you stay at uncle's home or go with me?
[30:58] Won't you ask before going that "Rutba go with me as well"?
[31:10] This is not the answer of my question.
[31:13] So, this is it.
[31:15] When question arises from both ends then answer is hidden in curtains like that.
[31:26] By the way, you rightly say one thing about yourself.
[31:33] What?
[31:37] That you are proud and arrogant.
[31:44] But then you say this as well that whatever is in your heart, you don't hide that.
[31:52] Then what's the reason that whenever I ask any question from you, your answers hide from me.
[32:19] Let me check.
[32:33] Come in.
[32:35] I thought if you are free then we will make the list for college picnic program.
[32:40] Didn't you make that?
Yes I made it but you know about business students.
[32:46] Please sit.
Are miss Rutba here?
[32:48] Yes she is here. Please sit.
[32:58] So you have decided this.
Yes, only business students are left, so twenty will be completed.
[33:07] Here comes tea.
[33:10] Hey, you bothered for no reason.
[33:13] You send something daily and we take your tea daily.
[33:19] So I thought to complete this duty myself today.
[33:23] You have made very delicious tea.
[33:26] So you are going with us. Right?
[33:29] Well, I didn't tell her about that event.
[33:35] But why?
[33:37] Let's go with us Rutba, you will enjoy so much.
[33:42] College management has chosen a very beautiful farm house for picnic.
[33:47] OK
[33:49] But you are saying this.
[33:51] Khurshid never said any such thing to me.
[33:56] Well, no, I didn't do that because Rutba is habitual of comforts.
[34:02] I don't know whether all those facilities will be there in that farm house, to which she is habitual.
[34:07] So I thought.
What did you think?
[34:11] You thought that I can live in this cottage by leaving Meher Ali house but how can I pass a single day anywhere else. It's just an excuse.
[34:23] Say it clearly that you don't want to take me with you.
[34:28] Mr. Khurshid, how bad it is.
[34:32] So it is fixed that you are going to participate with us in this program.
[34:38] Khurshid should say this to me.
Of course.
[34:43] Mr. Khurshid you should say this to her.
[34:47] So convince her to go with us, I am leaving now.
[34:53] Good bye
[35:05] Will you go with me?
[35:08] Do you really want me to go with you?
[35:11] I mean there will be miss Tazmeen and miss Azra with you, so I feel that you will be more happy without me. 
[35:19] Even then.
[35:22] If you will ask me to go with you then I will go.
[36:27] If I will have to go somewhere for a specific period then will you stay at uncle's house or go with me?
[36:38] By the way, you rightly say one thing about you that you are proud and arrogant.
[36:43] But then you say this as well that whatever is in your heart, you don't hide that.
[37:26] Where are you madam? Whereas Mr. Khurshid is very near you.
[37:33] Where can I go?
[37:36] I am here.
[37:38] I am observing your busyness.
[37:42] A free person can't do anything other than getting lost in other people's busyness.
[37:48] Why are you saying this?
[37:50] Mr. Khurshid is himself a busyness for you.
[37:53] Your attentions shouldn't be diverted anywhere else.
[37:58] You do regard Khurshid so much.
[38:02] He is like that Rutba.
[38:05] He is loved by every person present here.
[38:11] He is dearest to everyone.
[38:13] But only you are dear to him. Isn't this a regard for you?
[38:21] You say this but Khurshid never said any such thing to me.
