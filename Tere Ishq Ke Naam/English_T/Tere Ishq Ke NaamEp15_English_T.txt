[00:14] You won't have any relation or contact with Altamash
[00:21] Look Khursheed .. 
I'm not asking for explanations. 
[00:26] I'm clarifying that no matter how inferior I am for you
[00:32]  this marriage wasn't forceful
[00:36] You agreed. 
[01:28] I hope Altamash will like me, as he likes this color a lot on me
[01:32] yes! its good. But there is one problem 
[01:37] what?
[01:38] You seem like a beetroot in some farm
[02:05] hello!
[02:06] after listening to your voice, I feel as if the happiness has come back into my life
[02:15] Altamash
[02:18] you!
[02:20] I have changed my number
[02:22] but the voice is same
[02:26] you have not only changed the number
[02:29] but you have changed so many things
[02:34] eyes, path, destination...  everything
[02:41] then... 
[02:44] why are you contacting me now?
[02:47] you had called to inquire about my health
[02:50] and I came back to life while dying
[02:57] Rutba, I will stop breathing if I won't talk to you now
[03:03] but... 
[03:05] there is someone whom you had made a living corpse
[03:11] you have buried that Rutba who was dressed up as a bride, with your own hands
[03:20] you... 
[03:23] congratulations to you that you have lived up again!
[03:28] but Rutba Mehr Ali Khan has died
[03:31] Rutba listen to me...
I don't want to talk to you about anything, Altamash
[03:35] don't call me again ever
[03:38] Rutba
[03:40] Rutba
[04:11] I have told you not to contact Altamash
[04:18] but I.. 
Did I said it or not?
[04:21] Altamash had called me, I didn't
[04:25] but you were talking
[04:33] so what difference does it make?
[04:35] it does make a difference
[04:38] I am your husband, not your servant
[04:41] its your duty to fulfill my every legal command!
[04:48] see.. 
[04:50] I have become distant from Altamash, but it doesn't mean that I will become close to you
[04:54] what do you think, Rutba?
[04:57] that you are very far from my approach?
[05:03] its not at all difficult for me to get you
[05:07] and what do you think?
[05:09] that its just your contumacy in between us?
[05:13] No!
[05:15] there is also my ego & self respect in between us
[05:19] and I know it very well that how to protect my self respect
[05:26] stay away from Altamash
[05:31] but don't consider my leniency as my wish to get close to you
[05:37] remember that you came here by walking on your own
[05:42] I haven't taken a single step towards you as of yet
[05:47] don't forget this
[06:24] today sir Zeeshan was saying that your lecture was so good that he had sat along with the students to listen to it
[06:31] Greetings!
[06:36] It seems that I came on the wrong time
[06:40] No, no.. you haven't come on the wrong time. Please come, sit
[06:44] Please come
[06:58] loneliness is like a companion, a friend
[07:03] and sometimes this friend shows a lot of antics, also it irritates a lot
[07:09] a heart gets worried if the loneliness gets upset
[07:16] and then we start missing friends at various times, such as while standing, sitting, talking... 
[07:26] you are not alone, Ms. Tazmeen
[07:30] its just that Rutba & I are not good neighbors, and I know it 
[07:34] but yes, I also know that we can become good friends
[07:40] that's why, you can come here anytime without any hesitation
[07:46] thank you so much!
[07:48] and I am sure that you are not just a good friend but a good person as well, Mr. Khursheed
[08:35] I came to give you guys an invitation for tonight's dinner
[08:42] but why?
[08:44] just like that
[08:46] actually I have a delusion that I cook good food
[08:50] and if it feels like cooking something good, then it feels that there shall be someone to appreciate as well
[08:56] this is the only reason, nothing else
[09:00] I will like it if you people will have dinner with me tonight
[09:05] Yes sure, we'll come
[09:10] then at 8 PM?
[09:13] I will wait for you guys 
[09:15] Bye!
[09:47] Did Altamash eat anything?
[09:50] right now he is eating anger, and drinking the sips of regret
[09:56] its not an easy task to understand life
[10:01] a person learns a lesson after getting trough regrets
[10:09] now you'll see that my son will play every game thoughtfully
[10:17] what reply did your sister gave about the property?
[10:21] she hasn't answered
[10:24] She was teaching us a lot, to get all the properties in Altamash's name from brother Mehr Ali
[10:30] and now she is dying to do the same thing
[10:34] both mother daughter duo had gone completely quiet
[10:38] by the way Sanober, your sister is such a cruel woman
[10:42] yes yes! She is teaching us very good lessons
[10:48] but now she has to transfer the property in Altamash's name
[10:52] Come dear, sit
[10:58] come dear, sit with us
[11:14] did you talk to aunt?
[11:17] what answer did she gave?
[11:19] whether she answers or not, but she has to give the land
[11:24] our son is not an easy fish to trap
[11:27] why fish Bazil Khan? Call him a crocodile!
[11:38] who gulps everything that comes in front of him
[11:42] Greetings brother Mehr Ali, come.. have a seat
[11:47] is everything alright?
[11:49] Azka... Ronaq
[11:59] Greetings!
[12:02] Greetings!
[12:05] I came to drop your daughter in law
[12:08] I hope she will be welcomed whole heartedly
[12:13] you guys had closed your doors by seeing Rutba empty handed
[12:19] but Azka had brought a lot along with her
[12:23] She shouldn't have any complain. Are you getting me, Altamash?
[12:31] Azka is Altamash's wife
[12:34] and Altamash's love shall only be for Azka
[12:42] whatever belongs to Altamash is of Azka
[12:45] and whatever is Azka's is also of Altamash, but...
[12:51] my gifted property will only remain in Azka's name
[12:59] I hope that you have understood my point
[13:02] I'm leaving
[13:04] Uncle...
[13:14] I also want to discuss something important with you
[13:18] Sure
[13:49] not only I am invented, but Tazmeen has invited you too. You know that right?
[13:55] my name is just an excuse
[13:59] maybe, she doesn't know that she doesn't needs excuses
[14:07] uncle always wanted you to study further
[14:15] who can understand a child's needs more than a father?
[14:24] Khursheed, don't take the wrong meaning of my quietness
[14:29] if I listen to you quietly, then it doesn't mean that whatever you will say I will listen
[14:37] since you are not my slave, so I am also not your captive
[14:44] Fine! shall I go now, as I am getting late
[14:51] you are free from my side, I don't care!
[15:11] speak up, what do you want to say
[15:16] uncle you have played very well
[15:22] when a life is at stake then..
[15:24] a person doesn't plays with cruelty but thoughtfully
[15:30] Altamash
[15:32] Fate support those people who doesn't leave others in difficult times
[15:41] don't think that Altamash gave up
[15:44] Altamash
[15:47] I have to save my loved ones
[15:51] I have never thought about victory or defeat in the war of my loved ones relations
[15:57] but... a person who has impurity & dishonesty in his heart
[16:03] he sees the entire world as enemy
[16:08] I know it very well that why Azka is imposed on me
[16:14] but I am not that donkey who shall take the burden unwillingly
[16:20] Saeedpur properties are in Azka's name
[16:24] so let it be
[16:27] but what will I get to fulfill this relation?
[16:36] I don't like the trading of relations, Altamash
[16:42] but who wishes to get sold
[16:48] their price should be decided
[16:53] tell me, what do you want?
[17:00] Sheikhupura factories
[17:07] you have to transfer them on my name
[17:11] Azka can stay in this house only on this condition
[17:23] Okay
[17:26] it will be done
[18:06] Rutba... 
[18:09] Mr. Khursheed, why Rutba didn't come?
[18:13] Rutba is the owner of the lands, wealth & properties. Then why she cannot be the owner of her consent?
[18:20] Besides, ordinary people like me doesn't qualify on the requirement of others
[18:26] shall I say something if you don't mind?
[18:32] Ms. Tazmeen, my capability of minding something has become really weak
[18:39] you can say whatever you want to
[18:42] as I don't mind anything anymore
[18:46] Rutba is a girl
[18:48] soft o delicate, sensitive.. 
[18:51] maybe, the circumstances has made her stubborn and bigot
[18:58] because after seeing her, and meeting her. I have realized that she is quite delicate within inside as well
[19:07] who melts like a wax
[19:10] if you will distant her from yourself in this manner, then she will keep on melting like this
[19:17] maybe, you hadn't asked her to come along with you
[19:22] or maybe, you hadn't insisted her with love
[19:28] she needs a cure
[19:32] only a woman can see another woman's grief or sorrow easily
[19:41] but nobody thinks about a man who seems to be very strong from outside
[19:47] that maybe his emotions are also injured
[19:50] or maybe he needs an ointment of love
[19:57] I am not making a complain to you
[20:04] please sit, let me go & call her
[20:06] Sure
[20:09] I won't stop you
[20:12] I will wait for you to return alone, while sitting here
[20:16] its important to know the person whom you are favoring
[20:23] I am sure that she will not refuse me
[20:49] Rutba
[21:07] Ms. Rutba... Rutba
[21:26] Mr. Khursheed, Rutba is not at home
[21:31] what!
[21:39] Rutba
[21:42] Rutba
[21:46] Rutba!
[21:49] Rutba
[21:51] Rutba
[21:54] Rutba
[21:59] Rutba
[22:17] Rasheeda, when the day is spent with harsh realities
[22:22] then the nights are spend in the same manner
[22:26] even if I lie down on the bed, still I won't feel sleepy
[22:32] the sleeping pills are very cheap in price, Rasheeda
[22:36] but... a peaceful sleep is a very precious thing
[22:57] Saeedpur properties are in Azka's name
so let it be
[23:01] but in order to fulfill this relation you have to transfer the Sheikhupura factories on my name
[23:08] Azka can stay in this house only on this condition
[23:37] what is this brother, you are still awake
[23:40] the doctor had advised you to go to sleep early
[23:44] Rasheeda, when the day is spent with harsh realities
[23:49] then the nights are spend in the same manner
[23:52] even if I lie down on the bed, still I won't feel sleepy
[23:59] the sleeping pills are very cheap in price, Rasheeda
[24:02] but... a peaceful sleep is a very precious thing
[24:08] we don't get it very easily, a person has to do a lot of big sacrifices
[24:15] tomorrow morning, the lawyer will come. Kindly give this to him
[24:20] for what?
[24:24] these are the documents of Sheikhupoora towel factory, I have transferred them in Altamash's name
[24:32] why?
[24:34] he has quoted the price of his conscience
[24:37] anyways, at least Azka can stay married happily
[24:42] Can Altamash stoop so low?
[24:45] when a person's blood relations are not sincere, then the beating heart inside the chest also becomes unfaithful
[24:53] brother, your life is more precious than these ungrateful relations
[24:57] please go inside & rest, let me bring your medicines
[25:52] oh uncle!
[25:53] yes sir?
[25:54] did you see someone passing by?
[25:56] No, I didn't
[25:59] you are doing very nice duty
[27:02] brother, these are your medicines
[27:12] take them & rest, there is no need to take any tension
[27:23] whatever you order, my sister
[27:26] brother, how can I dare to order you
[27:29] just accept it considering it a sister's request
[27:35] Rasheeda, you are more important to me that my real sisters
[27:39] I can never repay the reward of your care
[27:49] your presence gives me a lot of courage
[27:52] also your presence gives me a lot of support
[27:57] people like you are God's blessings
[28:02] brother, now windup & keep aside all the worries
[28:08] and do rest after taking medicines
[28:12] Good night!
[28:14] good night!

[33:48] whatever I did, he had compelled me to do all this
[33:55] he thinks that he is very intelligent, wise etc. And I am nothing
[34:00] I am nothing for him

[36:29] then don't ever put yourself into any trouble
[36:34] dad, do you think that I am stubborn?

[36:53] then why are you worried now?
[36:57] what you had thought, dad?

[38:00] I don't believe that you will show such a careless attitude
[38:10] You! to whom I had handover my most precious mandate
[38:17] uncle, if Rutba would have said to me then I would have come here myself to drop her
[38:20] Rutba had left your house in anger, that too so late at night and you didn't even get to know?
