[00:56] yesterday, Rutba had gone to aunt Sanober's house with me to meet Altamash
[01:00] I tried explaining both of them a lot, but both of them are crazy about love
[01:05] Rutba shouldn't have broken your trust like this
[01:08] now see, yesterday Altamash was saying that if uncle didn't agree for the marriage
[01:13] then both of them will get married without your consent
[01:34] somehow the day passes, Rutba
[01:38] why the night time doesn't passes?
[01:41] it comes to take trial of the people who are in love
[01:45] or else it comes to check whether the people who were separate yesterday, have they met or not
[01:51] the night is like magic, Altamash
[01:55] love with the same person & same discussion
[01:59] it feels so good everyday
[02:01] the fragrance of flowers seems same everyday
[02:06] still it creates magic
[02:08] now tell me, how far is that night that will see us together?
[02:13] how shall I tell you? I wish taking a decision is in my control
[02:21] if you'll talk so softly then why will he listen to you?
[02:24] when one doesn't get their right, then its needs to be taken forcefully
[02:30] understand?
[02:31] dad doesn't want to listen to me in this matter
[02:34] you tell me, what shall I do
[02:51] I know its very difficult for you to go against your father's strict principles & decisions
[02:58] but Rutba
[03:00] love is that river which makes its path itself
[03:05] We had decided that you'll not continue your studies
[03:10] Also, we had decided that if uncle will not agree for our wedding then we'll get married secretly
[03:20] you stay ready
[03:25] Rutba?
[03:28] hello!
[03:33] are you listening, Rutba?
[03:36] Rutba!
[03:40] Rutba, I am talking to you
[03:45] hello! Altamash..
[03:48] dad has listened everything, just now he was standing here with me
[03:53] and you were continuously speaking, dad has heard everything
[03:59] very good! this is a good thing
[04:02] since you will be taking a few days to tell this matter to your father, so he got to know about it now
[04:07] but Altamash
[04:08] Rutba, I am your fiance
[04:12] I am with you, then why are you afraid?
[04:16] I've got more right on you than uncle
[04:20] I feel so insulted & hurt when you feel so scared of your father
[04:25] look... be brave, and take your decisions yourself
[04:33] are you getting me?
[04:51] uncle has hidden the actions of his dearest daughter in such a beautiful manner
[04:57] by the way, uncle has double standards
[04:59] brother's this behavior is quite old, he used to keep a strict eye on his sisters
[05:05] there was every kind of strictness & restrictions
[05:08] and when a girl entered his life, then leniency for her
[05:13] being spend thrift, all kind of freedom.
Poor sister Sajida
[05:18] She couldn't live for long
[05:20] maybe she got affected my mine & Sanober's curse
[05:23] I'll see, with which golden pen he'll write his daughter's fate
[05:29] mom, why do you always blame uncle? What about aunt Sanober?
[05:34] couldn't she see me? I mean, am I less beautiful than Rutba?
[05:39] and I less educated or what does she have that I don't have?
[05:44] Wealth!
[05:47] Money, properties & lands...  and the greed associated to it
[05:52] Azka, its the only thing that you don't have. That you don't have wealth & properties like Rutba have
[05:59] and Altamash is such a fool
[06:01] but sister Sanober is quite far sighted
[06:06] yes! do you know, she becomes extra sweet in front of Rutba
[06:11] I don't understand, why can't aunt & Altamash see anything in front of Rutba
[06:16] they can see
[06:18] they can see it far...
[06:21] and I know my sister Sanober, how much love does she have for her brother & niece
[06:27] its not love that speaks in her mouth, but Rutba's wealth
[06:32] very sweet... extra sweet
[06:36] but you can change my name from Ronaq if I didn't turn this sweetness into bitterness
[06:41] and you!
[06:44] you've left all the work on our mother?
[06:46] why God has given you so much of beauty, height etc...
[06:51] and you couldn't trap a guy like Altamash by your beauty
[06:56] Rutba had won from you in that as well!
[07:02] so mom, I'll turn the table
[07:04] I want to get married to Altamash
[07:07] its that bet which I cannot afford to lose at any cost
[07:44] uncle has hidden the actions of his dearest daughter in such a beautiful manner
[07:48] uncle has double standards
[07:53] do you know the meaning of being Tanveer Ali Khan's daughter, Ronaq?
[07:59] its the name & address mentioned on marble
[08:03] which anyone wants to place on the entrance of their house
[08:10] and yes! the same stone
[08:14] can become the gravestone of any unnamed grave
[08:18] if that person doesn't have loyalty in its blood
[08:21] What suspicion you are in, Ronaq?
[08:23] if you had looked at the weapons inside your father's palace before falling in love with Zahir's son
[08:33] then this rebellious thinking of yours would have set aside like a sea foam
[08:40] now you won't take a single step outside the house
[08:44] understand this very well
[08:47] as far as your education is concerned then a teacher will come to teach you inside the house
[08:52] dad... at least listen to me, dad
[09:17] dad, please don't.
dad!
[10:10] greetings, uncle!
[10:11] greetings to you too!
[10:13] why did you bother to come? You could have call me
[10:16] dear, the principles of this world are set
[10:19] a thirsty comes towards a well
[10:21] sit
[10:24] tea
[10:26] thank you, dear
[10:32] if someone have any request, solicitation or petition in their heart
[10:39] then it feels good to go to someone by themself
[10:41] uncle, why are you making me feel guilty?
[10:44] your simple words are order for me
[10:47] do you know, what's the biggest wealth in this worldly wealth?
[10:53] dutiful and truly loving child
[10:58] the well in which we invest our life time's strength
[11:03] and if the water of that well doesn't comes sweet
[11:06] then it feels like dying
[11:09] uncle, don't worry a lot. And don't think in such a sensitive manner
[11:15] dear, every person wants to see their child's love very closely
[11:22] but...
[11:24] let it be...
[11:27] nobody has control over love
[11:30] this wretched love is very egoistic
[11:34] uncle, tell me if there is any order for me
[11:38] No dear, no order
[11:41] I have a request
[11:43] if you can teach Rutba even one percent of wisdom then I will be very grateful to you
[11:51] help her to complete her education
[11:54] but she doesn't like me
[11:58] dear, our battle is from her illiteracy
[12:00] uncle, I am ready to tolerate everything for you
[12:05] but Rutba won't agree
[12:07] I know dear
[12:09] I am very well aware of your dutifulness & Rutba's contumacy and bigotry
[12:16] but Rutba has to agree on this
[12:18] you tell me, its a river of fire. Are you ready to cross it?
[12:57] Okay, you go
[13:05] Rutba, I've made your favorite breakfast. Quickly get ready after doing the breakfast
[13:10] brother Mehr had said that today he'll go to drop you off to the university
[13:18] aunt, take this breakfast away. I am not hungry
[13:23] I couldn't sleep the entire night, so I'll sleep
[13:27] please take it away. And please, tell everyone not to disturb me
[13:31] I want to sleep peacefully
[14:04] maam, its your sister's call
[14:07] Okay, go
[14:10] hello, greetings sister. Is everything alright? How come you've call me so early in the morning?
[14:15] Ronaq, come quickly. We have to go to brother Mehr's house. I think the matter has become serious
[14:21] what happened, sister. Why are you in such a hurry? Tell me what happened?
[14:26] brother Mehr has heard Rutba & Altamash's conversation
[14:29] children were talking about something & he might have mind it
[14:33] I fear, what if he does some injustice with my son while being adamant on his principles
[14:37] you know how brother Mehr Ali is, so unpredictable
[14:42] if he will refuse for the marriage once, then no power in this world can make him do it
[14:49] don't you worry my dear sister, but you are right.. brother is so unpredictable
[14:55] I must say, you should reach there as soon as possible. Go & handle the matter
[15:01] what do you mean? Aren't you coming?
[15:03] sister, how can I come?
[15:05] I have sprained my ankle yesterday evening. The doctor has strictly advised me to do bed rest
[15:12] otherwise sister, is there any possibility that its such an important matter & I should not be present there
[15:17] sister, I used to function on one leg & now its compromised
[15:20] Oh! you had to get a sprained ankle today
[15:23] you know, I fear talking to brother without you
[15:26] yes sister, I know. We both sisters are each others strength
[15:31] but sister, please listen to me. Don't delay this matter, go there as soon as possible & convince brother
[15:38] no matter what happen, no matter if brother gets very angry. But you have to ensure to convince him
[15:45] sister look, you cannot lose such an important chance
[15:49] you have to talk with pride being a boy's mother
[15:53] are you getting my point?
[15:54] yes yes, I am getting it. Ok then, bye!
[15:59] bye sister..
[16:02] what happen, mom?
[16:05] it hasn't happened yet, but its about to happen
[16:08] sister Sanober wanted to fix her son's wedding into a very rich family
[16:13] the entrance of rich family is quite high
[16:16] and if you don't step in properly then you fall after stumbling
[16:36] what happen, is everything alright?
[16:41] Sometimes Ronaq amazes me
[16:44] sometimes she is favoring us & sometimes she is favoring brother Mehr Ali
[16:48] don't know what's there in her heart
[16:52] I have always seen her blurting poison for uncle
[16:56] because she thinks that brother Mehr is the responsible for all her deprivation
[17:00] although our father had the right of decision for everything
[17:03] brother Mehr Ali had supported her a lot
[17:06] then why does she have a lot of complains?
[17:08] she is among those who are never happy in any condition
[17:12] dad had disinherited her
[17:15] He wasn't even ready to see her face. But is was brother Mehr Ali who had held her hand
[17:20] somebody can hold anyone's hand but they cannot write their destiny
[17:25] Ronaq doesn't understand this
[17:27] hmm...
[17:30] let aunty be, its fine if she doesn't want to go
[17:36] but we'll go to Mehr Ali House
[17:40] to fix the wedding date
[17:44] what if brother Mehr Ali didn't agree then?
[17:49] then I'll tell uncle
[17:52] that he is Rutba's West, and I am Rutba's East
[17:59] I have arise & he has set
[18:53] Rutba
[18:56] Rutba!
[19:03] so you won't go to the university?
[19:06] dad, I don't like to study why don't you understand?
[19:09] I get headache whenever I see the books
[19:12] making notes, gathering assignments & to give exams is not in my control. I...
[19:20] let me do whatever I want to do
[19:23] what else do you want to do besides marrying Altamash?
[19:26] so what's the harm in it?
[19:28] after all, our proposal was confirmed as per your consent
[19:31] No Rutba!
[19:34] it wasn't my consent
[19:37] I had bowed down my head in front of your choice
[19:41] but what shall a father bow down every time?
[19:46] you were born, I did you upbringing. I had loved you & fulfilled all your desires
[19:53] I had presented every luxury of your life to you
[19:58] I had fulfill all the desires of your heart
[20:05] doesn't a father have this much right, that you shall keep his honor intact?
[20:10] I'm observing..
[20:12] that nowadays your life is being controlled by Altamash
[20:18] and today, I'm seeing the contumacy, selfishness & obstinacy of my dearest daughter. While being empty hands
[20:28] from my same eyes, don't know how many sleepless nights these eyes have experienced for you
[20:38] dad, whatever parents do for their children is for their own happiness & satisfaction
[20:44] if my happiness is so precious to you then let Altamash enter my life
[20:48] I should have the right on my own life, dad
[20:55] brother, Sanober & Altamash have come downstairs to meet you
[21:01] I've made them sit in the hall, they are waiting for you
[21:04] if you will come over there
[21:06] then you'll see that appearance of your father that you had never seen before
[21:11] Rutba, a disobedient child is a sword
[21:16] whose attack is sharp & fatal
[21:21] but remember..
[21:23] a father's injured ego is more dangerous & powerful than an injured lion
[21:57] what does uncle want to prove by making us wait for so long?
[22:02] his status & our value in his eyes
[22:05] who has what status, uncle will get to know it very soon
[22:09] a day will come when he will sit on our house for hours to see a glance of his daughter
[22:21] you must have informed brother that we are here, right Rasheeda?
[22:25] yes, I've informed brother Mehr
[22:28] please drink tea, he is coming
[22:33] you have handled the entire house
[22:35] the entire expense calculations must be in your hands, right?
[22:38] brother Mehr look after the calculations, I'm not capable of it
[22:43] which calculations? the one you make?
[22:50] Khursheed looks after the land & proprieties related calculations
[22:53] right, aunt Rasheeda?
[22:56] We are indebted to brother Mehr
[23:01] whatever order he gives, we try our best to fulfill it
[23:05] Wow! what an enjoyment
[23:09] such favors are only done on the fortunate people like you
[23:14] we poor sisters never got to know the bank balance or earnings from land & properties
[23:21] Sanober, my real sisters have already got all that
[23:29] which was their religious right
[23:31] now if curiosity & suspicion doesn't see the rightful things
[23:37] then show patience
[23:40] greetings, uncle!
[23:43] greetings, brother!
[23:45] by the way, you have said a very nice thing about patience
[23:49] your sisters have always showed patience & have been very thankful
[23:52] they had never mind whatever their brother had said
[23:55] because this relation is precious to them
[23:58] and patience is the only weapon to solve such a delicate matter
[24:05] please sit
[24:18] Sanober, all the weapons are not used in the war only
[24:23] some weapons are used very quietly and...
[24:26] we don't get to know about it
[24:31] how come you have visited all of a sudden?
[24:35] its my brother's house...
[24:37] and then its my to-be daughter-in-law's house. I feel like coming here again & again
[24:46] We want to fix Rutba & Altamash's wedding date
[24:51] if you allow us
[24:54] We are very well aware of your reservations
[24:57] but what shall we do brother, the children are not ready for the delay
[25:02] and then our life & death is for our children, right brother?
[25:07] yes Sanober, you are right
[25:10] but sometimes the principles comes in between
[25:13] at that time, neither children love, rules or contumacy is considered
[25:21] by the way, I think instead of living & dying on your child's undue desires
[25:26] its better to live for your true principles
[25:33] uncle, you had promised that Rutba is my mandate
[25:38] I should have the right to seek her companionship anytime
[25:44] yes Altamash, I had promised you at the time of your engagement
[25:48] but you & your mother had also promised me about one thing
[25:51] what do you say about that?
[25:53] that matter is different, uncle
[25:55] now if Rutba doesn't want to study then how can you force her?
[26:03] this is me & my daughter's personal matter!
[26:06] but your demand is breaking of your promise
[26:14] and if you mother son duo have come here by thinking that you'll use Rutba's emotions against her father as a weapon
[26:21] then listen to me very carefully
[26:22] if I had the authority to say "YES" for the proposal, then I have the authority for saying "NO" as well
[26:33] neither I have given this authority to Rutba, nor I've nominated her in my heirship
[26:39] nobody can force me for these things
[26:42] Rutba's any decision without Mehr Ali's stamp will be just a piece of paper only
[26:52] which doesn't hold any importance or value!
[26:57] uncle, you aren't doing good
[27:00] I'm your to-be son-in-law
[27:03] taking me lightly can be harmful for you
[27:08] every person prove their status themselves
[27:13] others only validate it
[27:17] both of you can leave now
[27:20] and listen, Sanober
[27:22] if you want to come to this house being a brother's sister, then you'll find open doors & welcoming heart
[27:30] but if you want to come being my daughter's mother-in-law then be careful
[27:36] we won't do any discussion on this topic anymore
[27:39] Rutba's wedding will be done after her graduation, with anyone
[28:15] drive the car slowly, Altamash
[28:18] drink your anger for now
[28:20] We have to find the solution of this matter with a cool mind
[28:23] why I came back from there? Why!
[28:28] I would have called once & Rutba would have come running to me
[28:31] uncle would have got to know his importance!
[28:34] dear, you can burn your mouth by eating hot meal
[28:36] mom, my heart is burning right now. My blood is boiling!
[28:40] uncle is doing all of this to humiliate us
[28:43] Not only he wanted to educate Rutba, but wants to teach us a lesson. I'm getting everything
[28:48] but don't worry, until Rutba is in your control. This game is not easy for brother
[28:55] what needs to be done now?
[28:56] convince Rutba for marriage
[29:00] then you'll see, brother's pride will be shattered like a sand wall
[29:04] she is already convinced
[29:07] decide the wedding date with aunt Ronaq
[29:10] Rutba will come to me very easily
[29:13] you can change my name from Altamash, if I didn't shattered uncle's pride!
[29:17] the matter is not about Rutba only, its about the wealth & properties too
[29:23] didn't you hear what brother had said?
[29:25] no matter whatever uncle says
[29:27] Nikkah (wedding) is my right, and properties is Rutba's right
[29:30] I'll see who'll take away our right from us
[29:33] what will uncle do with so much of money? Will he take it to his grave?
[29:51] uncle, these...
[29:53] Khursheed, sit
[30:01] uncle, what happen? You seem worried
[30:04] when a beating heart becomes rebellious then..
[30:11] do you know how does one feels?
[30:14] only that person can tell you about it whose blood has stopped circulating
[30:21] anyways, let it be... nothing is left in this discussion
[30:29] uncle, I have prepared the file of this year's expense
[30:36] check it once
[30:37] let it be, Khursheed
[30:39] nothing is left in these things
[30:43] when a heart becomes rebellious then...
[30:46] what's the use of checking on profit & loss related matters
[31:00] dad, I want my phone!
[31:04] you cannot do this to me
[31:10] why?
[31:14] why I cannot do this?
[31:17] I am your father!
[31:19] if I feel that something is harmful for you, then I can keep it away from you
[31:34] I don't want you to talk to Altamash
[31:37] or to think about him
[31:41] if you will stop me, then I will go to Altamash after leaving this house
[31:54] do you want to go far away from me?
[31:57] do you want to lose your father's affection?
[32:00] look..  how helpless a father is that he cannot fulfill his daughter's desire although he want to
[32:08] Rutba, remember... this life will show you its true colors
[32:13] when you will fulfill your desire
[32:18] brother, control yourself. What are you doing?
[32:23] take her away, Rasheeda
[32:25] for now she will not talk to anyone, nor she'll go outside the house
[32:30] don't open the gate without my permission, inform everyone!
[32:34] and listen Rutba
[32:36] now come in front of me when you learn how to talk to your father
[32:58] please sit, you are not well
[33:01] do some rest
[33:03] let it be, Khursheed. What's the use of resting
[33:08] now the daughter & father are standing face to face
[33:13] we'll have to see
[33:15] either her contumacy is big or my status
[33:21] Okay please come, sit
[33:33] dear Rutba, you haven't eaten anything since morning
[33:36] eat some
[33:39] aunt, I have eaten a slap from my dad
[33:41] you had seen it
[33:43] is there anything left to eat after that?
[33:48] brother Mehr loves you a lot
[33:52] and nobody in this world can love you more than him
[33:56] he had slapped you for sure
[33:59] but you cannot imagine how hurt he is
[34:04] even I used to think the same, aunt
[34:08] but now the entire reality is exposed to me
[34:12] if somebody loves me then its just Altamash
[34:15] he doesn't need my degree, or anything else. He just loves me
[34:20] but dad! dad wants to imprison his daughter in this house
[34:27] dad only likes his contumacy
[34:31] He doesn't see anything else except for this property, wealth & lands. He doesn't love me
[34:38] he doesn't value his daughter & her desires
[34:43] He wants to imprison her in this house
[34:47] in the name of degree...
[34:49] he just want to waste my time, noting else!
[34:55] he...
[34:58] He is Mehr Ali, right?
[35:00] but he is forgetting that I am his daughter
[35:04] Rutba Mehr Ali, I won't give up!
[35:09] I wish Sajida would have been alive today
[35:13] then she would have never let you hate your father
[35:21] this is the matter
[35:24] my mother is not alive
[35:29] if she would have been alive today
[35:33] then dad would have never done so much injustice with me
[35:39] my mother is not alive
[35:44] I'm also like your mother, dear
[35:50] No! you are not like my mother
[35:54] you always favor my father, its you who give different suggestions to my father
[35:59] Aunt Ronaq & Aunt Sanober are right
[36:03] the importance you & Khursheed hold, even I don't have that much importance
[36:10] you have made my father a stranger for me
[36:14] he doesn't have any importance for his daughter
[36:17] he only gives importance to you people
[36:45] what is this, sister. What have you done?
[36:48] I had told you to handle the matter
[36:51] but everything got ruined
[36:54] what I should have handled?
[36:56] brother was thinking as if we have come to his house as a beggar
[37:01] he was talking to Altamash in such a manner as if he is not his son-in-law but servant...
[37:06] and with me, as if I am not his sister but some stranger
[37:16] brother Bazil, what is your suggestion? What should we do?
[37:22] Ronaq, we have to abduct the girl. That's it!
[37:29] Besides, we are Saeen
[37:31] in time of need, the owners of lands & proprieties
[37:38] becomes robber as well
[37:41] Altamash was so angry
[37:44] also Rutba's phone is switched off
