[03:23] I don't feel its morning time, until I hear your voice
[03:28] even I don't wake up, until you don't call me
[03:31] when you call me, it feels as if I can hear everything
[03:35] are you ready?
[03:37] how are you looking?
[03:39] Umm.... don't know. The mirror isn't telling anything

[04:13] and Altamash will be picking me on my way back as well, as we have to do the lunch

[07:05] you haven't done my assignment, right?
[07:08] Now I will see, how will you give the exam
[07:15] Khursheed Hasan, agname Sheeday
[07:31] who gets ready for university? I've got ready for the one with whom I will go to the university
[07:36] and Altamash will be picking me on my way back as well, as we have to do the lunch
[08:09] greetings uncle!
[08:11] greetings to you too!
how come you are here so early in the morning?
[08:15] actually... to drop Rutba to the university
[08:22] Rutba, haven't you gone with Azka? She came to pick you
[08:26] actually... 
[08:26] uncle, I was going on that side so I asked Rutba that I will drop her to the university
[08:31] Ok uncle, I will pick Rutba on my way back. We'll have lunch together on the launch of a big restaurant
[08:37] come back quickly, my dear
[08:38] Ok dad
[08:39] *farewell*
[09:24] Khursheed, I have kept the breakfast on the table
[09:29] what have you done?
[09:31] how come you've burnt it?
[09:32] you don't have another new shirt, what will you wear in your test?
[09:53] I think we'll order steak and... 
[10:02] what are you thinking?
[10:04] Khursheed hasn't done my assignment, now my marks will be deducted
[10:09] my dear, you don't need any marks to enter in my life
[10:15] I know... but my father wants me to do the graduation
[10:20] Rutba, you've spent enough of your life with your father
[10:24] Now its us, our life... the decisions as per our will
[10:29] a lot of time is left in your graduation, and I cannot wait for too long
[10:34] I have talked to mom
[10:37] soon she will meet uncle to fix the marriage date
[10:41] really?
[10:54] Mithu look, in order to become a good parrot you need to eat food
[10:59] otherwise, you'll get sick. Come on, eat it
[11:08] it seems madam mood isn't good today
[11:13] why? I am so happy
[11:18] is this how you are happy? But your face is telling something else
[11:25] No
[11:27] I am really happy
[11:30] do you know, today madam Rutba came to the university without assignment
[11:35] and she started to beg in front of the teacher as soon as she came
[11:38] that "Please teacher, give me a day's time"
[11:42] but No! the teacher didn't listen to her at all. She had deducted all of her marks
[11:48] its obvious, the card of being the only & dearest daughter of Mehr Ali won't work everywhere
[11:57] madam's entire mood was spoiled and then... 
[12:01] she had to go like that on the date
[12:05] do you know, even the teacher was asking
[12:08] since you don't like to study then why do you come here? Why you took admission?
[12:11] then? what did she said?
[12:14] what she has to say? As usual, she said very naively
[12:19] "madam, I don't feel like studying but my father... "
[12:25] "its his heartiest desire"
[12:27] that's why I have to come, otherwise I don't have any interest
[12:33] earlier, she just had the power of her father's wealth. Now she had the power of Altamash's love as well
[12:39] its obvious, this is the only way how she will react
[12:44] you are absolutely right
[12:47] do you know, I went to pick up Rutba in the morning for the university
[12:51] but what madam said, "Altamash is coming to pick me"
[12:55] and I will come back along with him
[12:58] I will never go to pick her ever
[13:03] I don't understand one thing, why uncle has given her so much of freedom?
[13:08] earlier, he used to impose very strict rules
[13:11] even I don't understand this
[13:14] he had imposed a lot of restrictions on me & sister Sanober
[13:18] we were allowed to leave the house after covering ourselves with shawls, along with the servants
[13:22] he didn't let us study after matriculation
[13:24] that if a girl will study more then they will start competing men
[13:29] and look at my brother now
[13:31] he has allowed his daughter to wander around anywhere along with her fiance
[13:36] he is giving her complete chance
[13:38] she goes for an outing with him on daily basis
[13:42] I don't understand one thing
[13:44] what does Altamash sees in Rutba?
[13:48] Altamash only sees Mehr Ali Khan's wealth in Rutba
[13:53] that wealth which my daughters doesn't have
[14:14] mom, don't you find Azka very sensitive about Rutba & Altamash's relation?
[14:20] haven't you felt?
[14:21] a child's pain & frustration is felt by a mother than her child
[14:27] no matter how much injustices were done with me
[14:30] but I won't let it happen with my children
[14:33] what do you mean, mom?
[14:35] nothing! go to your sister, her mood has spoiled. Go, talk to her
[14:40] Go
[14:47] you've humiliated Tanveer Ali Khan. You have disrespected the name
[14:53] Ronaq Ali Khan, you were given permission to leave the house for studying
[14:58] and you are wandering around with Nazara's son...
[15:36] Mr. Sheeday, get this defective piece of yours on the side
[15:41] or ask the bike to put this defective part on the side
[16:08] you may go
[16:14] brother, shall I make tea for you?
[16:18] yes make it Rasheeda, tea helps in waiting
[16:22] Rutba hasn't come back as of yet?
[16:24] she will come
[16:26] don't worry a lot
[16:28] Rutba hasn't gone with some stranger
[16:31] Altamash is our own child, he is her fiance
[16:35] slowly & gradually Altamash will take her responsibility
[16:39] and he will take more care of Rutba than you
[16:42] Rasheeda, only daughter is like a beating heart
[16:47] she will vacate my heart along with my house
[16:50] God Forbid!
[16:52] may God bless you with long & healthy life, brother
[16:56] there is liveliness in this house because of you
[16:59] we feel protected
[17:01] I pray for you in every prayers
[17:05] may God bless you with long life
[17:07] thank you, Rasheeda
[17:09] your words give me a lot of strength, Sanober & Ronaq are my real sisters but...
[17:15] the honor & respect you have given me
[17:20] my sisters cannot give me
[17:22] brother, I hold a very low status
[17:26] sister Sajida had brought me in this house for sure
[17:30] but you had put a hand of affection on our heads
[17:35] Khursheed Hasan's father died so early
[17:40] I couldn't believe it
[17:42] neither shelter on the head, or ground under the feet
[17:47] we were in between of nowhere
[17:50] sister Sajida had supported us & you had always given importance to her decisions
[17:57] brother, you didn't let us feel anything missing ever
[18:02] even after Sajida's demise, you've always been a kind brother & generous father
[18:10] then why I shouldn't remember your favors?
[18:13] greetings dad, I am here!
[18:15] greetings uncle! Sorry, we got a bit late. We didn't get to know about the time
[18:22] sit, drink some tea
[18:25] No, I am leaving. As mom must be waiting
[18:28] she wants to come to you, as she wants to discuss something important
[18:32] she can come for sure, its her brother's house
[18:34] a sister coming to her brother's house, increases a brother's honor
[18:37] absolutely uncle
[18:39] I hope you will also honor your sister's words
[18:46] I'm leaving, bye!
[18:51] bye!
[18:54] Ok dad, I am also going to my room
[19:38] my son is back
[19:41] a mother's eyes feel happy, all my tiredness goes away as soon as I see my son
[19:49] mom, please don't so much of work. There are a lot of servants in the house
[19:54] oh dear! I am not a servant over there. All the house chores are my responsibility
[19:58] and dear, its not an easy task to take care of all the chores
[20:03] brother Mehr shouldn't be hurt, that's why I keep myself busy in work
[20:08] and he is so satisfied after handing over everything to me
[20:13] Okay fine!
[20:15] give me something to eat, I am so hungry since morning
[20:19] let me bring it right away. Also, you had left in the morning without breakfast
[20:24] mom, don't talk about the morning. Besides, its very difficult to pass the day
[20:30] dear look...
[20:33] these only children are like this
[20:39] don't take it to your heart
[20:41] and... brother Mehr takes very good care of you
[20:45] he has done so many favors on us
[20:50] try to forgive Rutba, if she does something wrong unintentionally
[20:56] let me serve lunch for my son, Ok? 
Go & get freshen up
[21:12] Mr. Sheeday, get this defective piece of yours on the side
[21:16] or ask the bike to put this defective part on the side
[21:55] brother Mehr won't make a mistake of refusing
[21:59] he knows it very well that neither we or his only daughter will give any value to his refusal
[22:06] enough of her studies now
[22:09] does he want to make her the Prime Minister of this country now?
[22:12] its such a big house, she should take care of it. 
We don't want her to do speeches
[22:17] or, she didn't had to speak philosophy here
[22:22] mom, university doesn't teach anything to anyone
[22:27] All the skills lies within a person
[22:30] I haven't studied after college
[22:32] but I deal with the world
[22:34] all the servants run around on my one action
[22:39] Besides, I will never want my to-be-wife to study more than me
[22:43] and then she shall bully me with her degrees
[22:47] it makes the woman go crazy for no reason
[22:50] she starts considering her husband inferior
[22:54] these educated women cannot fix their families, but they go out to fix the world
[23:01] they cannot handle their house, & yet they think of handling the world
[23:06] I've told uncle that we are coming
[23:10] and uncle is dreaming to send Rutba to the university
[23:13] and I am getting restless to bring her into this house
[23:17] All praise to God! My son has become young man
[23:22] did you hear him, Mr. Bazil?
[23:23] yes yes
[23:24] your son wants a bride now
[24:05] greetings uncle!
[24:06] greetings to you too! Stay blessed Khursheed, what is happening?
[24:10] uncle, I wanted a few references for the notes. So I thought to come here
[24:15] you've hidden entire treasure here
[24:19] dear, a treasure is unlucky if there is no one to gain profit out of it
[24:24] I feel so happy whenever I see you reading these books with a lot of enthusiasm
[24:31] It was my heart's desire that Rutba shall touch the heights by studying very well
[24:37] but my undue love has made her distant from the hardships & nearer to the luxuries
[24:47] I don't blame anyone for Rutba's careless attitude, but myself
[24:57] uncle, a person chooses his/ her favorite path after becoming sentient
[25:06] Khursheed, this is your last year in the university right?
[25:10] yes uncle! God willing, I will be done with graduation this year, then I have intended to do masters & PH.D
[25:17] all praise to God! very nice
[25:19] you'll become the coolness of your mother's eyes
[25:23] I don't think so that Rutba will be able to complete her graduation
[25:29] its just her first year in the university
[25:34] and I am finding Altamash's intentions strange
[25:38] anyways... check your references
[25:41] Okay uncle
[25:53] Azka, you haven't got ready as of yet?
Quickly get ready
[25:57] mom & aunt Sanober will reach at uncle's place before us
[26:00] let them be
[26:02] as if I have to beat the drums in happiness over there
[26:08] and why are you showing so much of excitement?
[26:11] leave my excitement
[26:14] tell me, why such a long face?
[26:18] Azka, accept the fact that Altamash is of Rutba now
[26:24] this the matter of hearts, if he likes Rutba then let it be...
[26:28] you can like someone else
[26:30] Simple! you will get a better guy than brother Altamash
[26:40] better than Altamash?
[26:47] have you ever seen a better guy than Altamash?
[26:52] I haven't
[26:56] he is just like a prince charming
[27:00] look at his eyes
[27:02] his voice, his attitude...
[27:05] whenever he says something, everyone goes quiet
[27:10] when he walks, it feels as if everything gets still
[27:14] his dressing...
[27:17] he wears such a nice clothes!
[27:20] his choice is so different in fragrances too
[27:23] Arfa, have you ever felt that...
[27:28] whenever I pass by Altamash then...
[27:32] my eyes gets closed with senselessness
[27:36] Madam, go & take the medicine of consciousness
[27:39] because whom you are talking about, he is about to become Rutba's husband
[27:44] we are going to fix their marriage date today, what if anyone listens to your discussion
[27:49] let them hear it, I am not afraid of anyone
[27:54] Fine! Let's go & tell Rutba that you like Altamash & she shall leave him
[28:01] Okay?
[28:11] Mithu, we'll enjoy the most
[28:14] when Altamash will leave Rutba, right?
[28:30] Rutba, your dress looks so nice. From where you've bought it?
[28:34] Altamash had gifted this to me
[28:35] Wow!
[28:36] he asked me to wear it, as it will suit me a lot
[28:42] but is it necessary that uncle will say "yes" for the marriage so soon?
[28:47] he could refuse too
[28:52] nothing is more precious for my father than my happiness
[28:56] and he knows that Altamash's companionship is the biggest happiness of my life
[29:02] he cannot refuse
[29:32] please come
[29:35] how are you, Rasheeda? How is your life going?
[29:38] thanks to God
[29:40] Your health seems good. Also, you have started to look young as soon as your son becomes mature
[29:45] please come inside, let me inform brother Mehr
[29:52] brother Mehr! it seems that he is the real brother of this missy than ours...
[29:56] lets go, sister
[30:01] Wow! you apply such a nice henna. I hope that you apply henna on my marriage too?
[30:05] Okay
[30:06] Wow! you are really so excited about the marriage
[30:09] I am not excited for the marriage, I am excited to spend my life with Altamash
[30:14] do you know, Altamash says that after marriage we'll do all the work together
[30:19] what as such difficult tasks are going to happen in your life that you've started to plan as of yet?
[30:23] one thing I know for sure
[30:25] after marriage, she will have a lot of kids
[30:29] and then you will be giving lists of pampers & milk to Altamash
[30:34] nothing as such will happen
[30:36] because we'll wander around for almost 2 to 3 years, we'll enjoy our honeymoon
[30:41] We'll see the entire world together
[30:43] why don't you go to the space for once, do visit the moon. But...
[30:46] remember one thing
[30:48] upon returning, Aunt Sanober will be giving you a long list of responsibilities
[30:54] why do you always say such things?
[30:57] do you know, sometimes I think that I will ask aunt Ronaq
[31:01] that what as such you had eaten while giving birth to you, that you talk such things?
[31:07] madam, Sir is calling you downstairs. The guests have arrived
[31:12] you go, I am coming
[31:19] we won't listen to any denial, brother
[31:22] Rutba is our mandate with you
[31:25] and one should return the mandate upon asking
[31:33] *Greetings!*
[31:47] Sanober
[31:48] yes brother...
[31:51] do you remember what I had said when you had asked for Rutba's marriage proposal for Altamash?
[31:57] what condition I had kept
[32:01] brother, we don't need your daughter to built a rocket though
[32:07] children look good while being happy & lively
[32:11] now see, if they will get married now then in the future we will be called grand parents
[32:19] why should we wait a lot for such small happiness?
[32:25] you are right, Sanober
[32:28] God willing, our generation will be raised by Rutba in the future
[32:32] So, an educated mother can take better care of the future generation
[32:39] anyways, Rutba & Altamash will get married once Rutba completes her education
[32:45] and this is my final decision
[32:54] but brother, studies...
[32:57] uncle....
[33:04] greetings!
[33:06] yes Khursheed, what is the matter?
[33:08] uncle, you had asked me to prepare the Zakat documents of properties & bank balances
[33:12] kindly check them once
[33:19] thank you, you may leave
[33:22] Okay
[33:30] Altamash...
[33:32] yes uncle
[33:33] kindly check these documents prepared by Khursheed, are they fine or not?
[33:37] uncle, I don't have an experience of these things. All of these things are handled by my lawyer
[33:47] this is the difference between a well-educated person & an illiterate person
[33:57] God willing, Khursheed will prove to become a very skillful man
[34:01] In the future, I would like to feel proud on Rutba's skills too
[34:07] and for that, you people have to wait for a few years
[35:15] Rutba & Altamash will get married once Rutba completes her education
[35:20] and this is my final decision
[35:22] this is the difference between a well-educated person & an illiterate person
[35:27] In the future, I would like to feel proud on Rutba's skills too
[35:33] and for that, you people have to wait for a few years
[36:23] how come this clock had stopped all of a sudden?
[36:29] yes uncle, did you call me?
[36:32] yes Khursheed, all of a sudden it had stopped working. Kindly check
[36:38] your deceased aunty had bought this clock with so much of love
[36:42] and its very near to my heart as well, kindly check
[36:45] Can I open it to check, if you say so?
[36:47] yes yes, open it & check. I think it got stuck
[36:53] but maybe you were going to the university, I hope you won't get late
[36:56] No uncle, actually my motorcycle has broke down & the point will take some time to come
[37:00] please sit & have breakfast, meanwhile I will check it
[37:03] yes, please check it
[37:46] No...
[37:49] Rasheeda, have you made my daughter's favorite breakfast or not?
[37:54] yes brother
[37:55] Rutba, I've made special french toasts today for you
[38:13] uncle, I have fixed the clock. Kindly check the rest
[38:16] thank you dear... 
Rasheeda, you are very lucky
[38:21] that you've got such an intelligent son
[38:23] thank you, brother
[38:30] I am getting late for university
[38:32] uncle, I am also getting late so I am leaving as well
[38:34] Khursheed, you must have missed your point by now. 
Rutba, take Khursheed along with you
[38:38] his university comes in your way
[38:41] dad, today I am going from another route as I have to pick up my friend as well
[38:45] Khursheed, take a cab
[38:49] dear, at least have breakfast
[38:54] let Khursheed eat this
[39:04] uncle, I shall take your leave now
[39:07] *farewell*
[39:26] what do you think?
[39:28] will you be able to get a good status in my father's eyes by doing all these things?
[39:34] I don't have any concern with any status, Rutba
[39:37] whatever I do, I don't do it with any hidden intention. I do it with my pure intentions
[39:43] really!
[39:47] still, your status won't change
[39:51] you will still remain the same
[39:54] Khursheed agname Sheeday
[39:58] no matter if you get ten degrees in front of your name
[40:02] still, you cannot become like Altamash
[40:06] and neither my father will transfer any part of his wealth in your name
