[00:14] Perhaps they both like each other and have come very close.
[00:21] Are you sure of what you are saying?
[00:26] No doubt Khurshid doesn't have courage to tell the truth but I know.
[00:33] Tazmeen likes him and he is very happy to by spending time with her.
[00:47] Do you know about Khurshid's importance in your life? Khurshid is the guarantee of your happiness throughout your life.
[00:55] He is that person, who likes you since childhood.
[01:00] He loves you.
[01:06] And this love can't be done by a greedy and selfish person like Altamash.
[01:13] This love was the plant that grew out of the seed of your mother's innocent desire which she tried to hide from me.
[01:28] I have never been dishonest, never cheated.
[01:42] You didn't do a good thing by blaming Khurshid Aslam today.
[01:47] Today, I have seen the reflection of your aunts in you, who had bad intentions, unfaithfulness and falsehood.
[01:55] The father who wanted knowledge and culture for you is very embarrassed in front of them today.
[02:02] Apologize to Khurshid if possible.
[03:07] When did you come uncle? You didn't tell me otherwise I would come to pick you.
[03:23] I haven't slapped you but I have slapped myself.
[03:40] I didn't expect this from you Khurshid.
[04:53] Greetings
[04:55] Sir Khurshid has sent the meal.
[04:58] And where is he himself?
[04:59] He was in college and asked me to take this meal from canteen and delivery it to you.
[05:03] Thank you.
[05:08] Sister
[05:14] May I come in?
[05:20] Come.
[05:22] Thanks.
[05:55] Greetings uncle.
[05:58] Ever since I woke up, I've been collecting pieces of my shattered inner self.
[06:13] Are you alright, uncle?
[06:15] What do I say, Khurshid?
[06:18] A termite hollows a tree from inside and sorrow hollows a person from inside.
[06:28] Everything looks fine from the outside, but when the tree falls, it is known that the shade has ended.
[06:40] Uncle slap me a hundred times but for God's sake don't talk like this.
[06:48] I just wanted to apologize to you.
[06:55] I didn't have courage to see the pain on your face.
[07:03] But Khurshid, forgive me.
[07:10] I didn't do good to you.
[07:12] Don't say that uncle, I swear, I can never have any grievances in my heart against you.
[07:20] Your slap has been quenched by the moisture of my tears long ago.
[07:24] I will smile, if I'll be able to see your smiling face.
[07:30] Do take care of that stupid girl, Khurshid.
[07:34] If I will see her smiling then I will love my life and maybe I would wish to live long again.
[07:48] Because there is only darkness around me.
[07:54] I need the light of happiness of both of you.
[08:02] Yes uncle.
[08:50] I have completed two years here today.
[08:57] Brother wanted that I don't do job and get married but I didn't agree.
[09:04] I love this profession.
[09:10] And
[09:12] I also felt that there is nobody left in this world to whom we can love.
[09:24] Why?
[09:26] Why do you feel like that?
[09:31] Because the passion of love is extremely true and selfless.
[09:38] Deceiving, cheating and lies are not tolerated by me.
[09:43] They stick with love like a decease.
[09:47] And then
[09:49] Love not remain but it becomes a regret.
[09:57] And then I met Mr. Khurshid, then I understood that how to live a life in this selfish world.
[10:17] My first meeting with him is like as if we see stars after night's darkness then heart becomes hopeful for something good.
[10:36] I am not the only one who says this, the residents of this building, lecturers, students and principal everyone likes him.
[10:54] And do you know?
[11:00] Those who are liked by God are also liked by everyone in the world.
[11:11] You like Khurshid.
[11:16] You want to tell me about that.
[11:19] Don't you?
[11:22] If I say "Yes" then it will not be wrong.
[11:29] Because I feel that you don't find such people again and again to whom you give respect so much and you lower your gaze in front of them due to respect.
[11:43] And I can never give respect to such a person who is a cheater, selfish and ambiguous.
[11:57] Such a person is not worthy of love, but also not worthy of trust.
[12:06] What do you want to say? Say it clearly.
[12:10] I want to say that I like Khurshid and perhaps I would fall in love with him if I wouldn't meet you.
[12:24] I came to know about your relation with Mr. Khurshid when you came here.
[12:30] It's not only a legal relation but also.
[12:34] But?
[12:36] What do you mean by that?
[12:38] A heart relationship, an emotional relationship
[12:44] Do you know that, how much Khurshid Hasan loves you?
[12:49] I have seen the love shine in his eyes when he comes in front of you.
[12:54] And this the sign of true love only.
[13:00] This is certain.
[13:03] I respect Khurshid Hasan immensely.
[13:08] But I can't dare to love him.
[13:14] He is only yours.
[13:17] Only yours.
[13:19] And you should also realize that
[13:23] How lucky and rich you are.
[13:30] Protect your wealth.
[13:37] Can everyone be so lucky that he is rich because of wealth of love?
[14:09] You shouldn't have said all this.
[14:14] I was forced to say that Mr. Khurshid.
[14:18] I am sorry that this secret has been revealed but I am happy that whatever I said was truth.
[14:30] Secret is a weakness but truth is strength.
[15:56] OK, come tomorrow.
[15:59] And bring account with you as well.
[16:01] I want to have some calculations. So it will be good.
[16:05] I want that...
[16:08] I wanted to have an important discussion so I will discuss tomorrow.
[16:13] Bye
[16:18] Give some time to me as well.
[16:20] Or maybe I just have to wait.
[16:26] We mean a lot to each other, my dear.
[16:30] You should know that
[16:37] I get bored all day.
[16:39] Earlier, there was a issue with your leg, thankfully it's got better then
[16:44] You keep yourself busy in so many things.
[16:47] What do I do all day?
[16:53] Altamash.
[16:57] Let's have dinner outside?
[17:00] I am waiting for someone.
[17:03] We will go for dinner after a while.
[17:08] You have again called someone.
[17:12] At least you would have spent one evening with me.
[17:16] Everything belongs to you my love.
[17:23] As I told you, let me finish that important task, then we will go.
[17:30] Sir
[17:31] Mr. Nehal has sent this file, his driver gave this.
[17:36] OK, go.
[17:42] We will go for dinner after a while. OK.
[17:44] What is this Altamash?
[17:48] This is not beneficial for you.
[18:22] I have made tea for you.
[18:27] Maybe you don't like it.
[18:30] But even then
[18:38] Thanks
[18:44] By the way
[18:47] You don't have to bear the burden of my liking and disliking on your shoulders.
[18:57] I know that.
[19:01] You don't have to bear the burden of me or our relation on your shoulders too.
[19:07] You are not bound to me or this relationship.
[19:16] As long as we are connected in this relationship
[19:20] We are morally, legally and religiously bound to each other.
[19:28] Neither you are free from it nor me.
[19:40] I know that you are not bound to me or to our relationship.
[19:47] Rather you are bound to dad's happiness and his wishes.
[19:52] If it wasn't so, you would never deny that you started to like miss Tazmeen.
[20:14] Do you know, what's your biggest problem?
[20:17] What's your biggest weakness?
[20:20] That you don't understand both the relation and emotions.
[20:30] You don't differentiate between good and bad.
[20:36] Do you know, what's your biggest weakness?
[20:43] What?
[20:48] That there is no weakness in you.
[20:54] I admit that I am not intelligent like you and I don't have the ability to differentiate between good and bad.
[21:07] I don't understand the world and I don't have degrees like you.
[21:13] But I have one good quality.
[21:17] Really?
[21:22] What's that?
[21:24] That I look like, what I am.
[21:29] I can't cheat, neither to myself nor to anyone else.
[21:37] If I love someone then I can't hide that.
[21:43] And if I don't do that then I can't pretend that.
[22:34] Have a look at my face.
[22:38] My eyes, my nose and my lips all are same.
[22:44] You are sitting closer to me as much as I am sitting closer to you. 
[22:48] I didn't deprive you from any right of yours.
[22:59] Where is Altamash?
[23:00] I advised you that don't leave him alone for a single moment.
[23:07] Mom, uncle has sent an important file through driver.
[23:12] Altamash hid that from me.
[23:14] He didn't tell me that what's in that file?
[23:19] OK
[23:21] Try to find out what's in that file at any cost.
[23:27] Greetings
[23:28] Greetings, when did you come Ronaq?
[23:31] I have just arrived ten fifteen minutes ago.
[23:33] That's great.
[23:35] Hey Azka, you dressed up for going outside with Altamash. didn't you?
[23:41] So go for outing and enjoy yourself.
[23:45] Yes
[23:46] What will you get here with these old people?
[23:49] The same old stories.
[23:51] The issues and quarrels related to land.
[23:55] And grievances of Mehar Ali.
[23:58] Am I right Ronaq?
[24:00] Yes, you are right brother but
[24:03] If there is any grievance in the heart then it comes out someday.
[24:08] He was our elder brother but we didn't get anything except his forcefulness and bossy nature.
[24:13] We (both sisters) kept longing for his love throughout our lives.
[24:17] And who got that love?
[24:18] Rutba and sister Sajda robbed that with both hands, am I right?
[24:22] Absolutely right. yes it is.
[24:25] Let's go Azka, we are getting late.
[24:27] Altamash, you ignored everyone, your aunt is here. Come and sit with her.
[24:32] Mom
[24:33] Those who are busy are the ones who are successful.
[24:38] And don't mind but you are here to give her company.
[24:44] Am I right aunt?
[24:52] Azka
[24:55] I will have to go for land visit in the morning, come quickly I am waiting in the car.
[25:05] OK mom I am going.
OK my darling.
[25:09] Bye
[25:15] Bring tea.
[25:17] Yes, I will bring tea for you.
[25:42] Do you know the importance of Khurshid for you?
[25:44] He is guarantee of your whole life's happiness.
[25:47] He is that person Rutba
[25:49] He likes you since childhood. He loves you.
[25:53] And a greedy and selfish person like Altamash can't do that.
[25:58] This love was the plant that grew out of the seed of your mother's innocent desire which she tried to hide from me.
[26:08] He never saw you thoroughly.
[26:13] Never be dishonest and never cheated.
[26:19] I can't give respect to such a person who is a cheater and selfish and consider love as business.
[26:33] Such person doesn't deserve love nor the trust.
[27:25] What happened?
[27:27] I am asking the same thing that what happened?
[27:31] But I didn't say anything.
[27:34] I didn't say anything too but I am not smiling by standing here for so long like you.
[27:44] Well
[27:46] And if you will stand here and smile like this then I will get worried.
[27:54] Why? Why will you get worried?
[27:57] I mean that
[27:59] Aren't you get possessed by some devil and witch that you are smiling at me?
[28:10] This is your misunderstanding.
[28:14] Because by seeing you no gene or witch will smile.
[29:04] What happened? You aren't eating anything.
[29:07] Do we order something else or is it sufficient?
[29:11] No. No.
[29:13] It's sufficient.
[29:16] Earlier you used to insist to come to this restaurant.
[29:18] And we are now but you aren't eating anything. Don't you like the food?
[29:27] Altamash have you remembered that time when you, me and Rutba used to go for outing together?
[29:40] I remember.
[29:42] I remember everything.
[29:47] And both of you involved with each other more than eating.
[29:51] Food was just an excuse.
[29:55] You kept seeing Rutba only. Do you remember?
[30:01] Are you here to discuss old things?
[30:07] Do you know Altamash, I wanted that you don't see her at all.
[30:13] And that smile was so beautiful, wasn't that?
[30:19] Which doesn't come on your face now.
[30:25] If Rutba is not in your life then so what, I am here with you.
[30:31] With you and very near you.
[30:35] And now on these eyes and smile, there is my right.
[30:47] Why are you laughing?
[30:50] Azka
[30:52] You women have nothing except emotionalism.
[30:57] What do you mean?
[31:00] Have a look at my face.
[31:04] I have same eyes, nose and lips.
[31:11] You are sitting close to me as much as I am sitting close to you.
[31:15] And I didn't deprive you from any of right of yours.
[31:20] Neither Rutba is here nor that passed time.
[31:26] You have only memories Azka.
[31:29] Be practical.
[31:32] I have lost Rutba.
[31:35] But she has captured your senses.
[31:38] You can't see the food on this table but you can see Rutba sitting among us.
[31:45] I can see so many things which you can't see.
[31:51] Listen to me Azka.
[31:54] I know how to set my goals and how to achieve those as well.
[32:00] I am in my senses even after losing Rutba.
[32:05] I am living my life.
[32:07] Whereas, you are out of your senses despite you have got me.
[32:16] You don't know how to celebrate an achievement.
[32:23] A loser is always a loser.
[32:27] Waiter.
[33:17] I like Khurshid and I would fall in love with him if I wouldn't meet you.
[33:26] It is certain Rutba that I respect Khurshid Hasan immensely.
[33:32] But I can't dare to love him.
[34:00] Congratulations to you.
[34:03] I didn't understand.
[34:05] Well, it's your birthday today. Happy birthday.
[34:10] Thank you. Actually, I didn't give this day any importance so that I remember the date.
[34:16] This is the problem.
[34:17] You don't give that importance to yourself which you deserve.
[34:21] The person who gives importance to himself
[34:24] He gets his right with complete confidence.
[34:28] Thanks Tazmeen.
[34:29] By the way, let me tell you that you name should have been "Roshni".
[34:33] Because your thoughts are bright even on the darkest of things.
[34:37] And those are very fortunate who accompany you that they got a guide like you.
[34:41] I understand that you are complaining about my advises.
[34:47] No, there is no such thing.
[34:50] I am a lecturer so I will the lecture.
[34:53] If you want then I will sit in your next class.
No, there is no need for that.
[34:58] Spend most of your time with Rutba, I don't want any complaints in this regard.
[35:04] Rutba has such a huge PR.
[35:06] I didn't know about that.
[35:07] Just observe.
[35:21] Greetings mam.
[35:24] Greetings.
[35:25] Mam, we are here to meet sir Khurshid, today is his birthday so we want to wish him.
[35:30] Well
[35:33] OK
[35:34] Excuse me mam, we want to give him a surprise, please don't tell him.
[35:41] OK, come in.
[36:03] Khurshid
[36:16] Khurshid
[36:17] What happened? Is everything alright?
[36:21] Everything is alright.
[36:23] Your students are here to celebrate your birthday.
[36:29] They have brought gifts.
Oh no.
[36:35] Rutba, please press my cloth.
[36:38] Let me get fresh.
[36:39] OK
[36:56] Sir has come.
[36:58] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear sir.
[37:09] Happy birthday Mr. Khurshid.
[37:11] Thank you.
[37:13] Sir we have brought some gifts for you.
[37:43] Won't you wish Mr. Khurshid?
[37:49] There is no shortage of people to wish Mr. Khurshid.
[37:52] No one can take your place Rutba.
[37:59] Look carefully.
[38:01] How happy Mr. Khurshid is.
[38:08] Just wish him happy birthday and see.
[38:12] You will see and feel that as well that how will he be more happy.
[38:54] Happy birthday
[39:03] Thank you.
