[00:14] I started? You have started it Azka.
[00:17] Till you were in this house you used to make fuss in the house. You like to make noise and have fun.
[00:23] Now have gone there to Altamash by getting him after so mucn difficulties.
[00:28] Even then you are making noise and crying.
[00:39] But you are dear to him. Isn't this a regard for you?
[00:47] You say this.
[00:49] Khurshid never said such thing to me.
[01:01] What? What he didn't say?
[01:06] What do you want to hear?
[01:08] That he likes me or he loves me.
[01:17] Rutba don't you understand language of his eyes?
[01:24] No.
[01:28] Why do I understand? He doesn't understand anything? Nothing.
[01:37] For example? What is not understandable for you?
[01:43] That the relation among us needs words.
[01:52] This relation is dependent on expression of words.
[01:58] You say that Khurshid likes me and loves me.
[02:08] I accept it but he never expressed this to me.
[02:17] Whether it's his honor, his ego, his naughty nature or any desire to test me.
[02:28] I don't know but I accept.
[02:35] Because my dad say same things as you are saying to me.
[02:40] Then I will wait. I will wait that Khurshid will express his love for me by himself.
[02:51] He express through words that he loves me.
[02:55] I know that one day he will say to me that he likes me and he loves me.
[03:08] And what will be your reply at that time Rutba?
My reply will be that whatever I have learned, I have learned it from Khurshid.
[03:18] Then it is patience, endurance or love.
[05:34] It was a very beautiful day today, everyone is smiling since morning whether it's students or teachers.
[05:41] The purpose of coming here today in not only to play and have fun but to realize about this fact that beauty of life is in changing "No" into "Yes".
[05:54] In converting thorns into flowers and sorrows into peacefulness.
[06:00] In defeating the defeats and move towards success.
[06:06] And in observing the lives of those people which we have seen on the way.
[06:14] The place where no one can even imagine to live, today all those routes are densely populated. Why?
[06:27] Because behind that there was hard work of people and their passion to do something.
[06:32] Just like we are here to celebrate your successes, all of this is because your hard work and passion.
[06:40] And no doubt because of Almighty who considered us to do this and chose us among billions.
[06:48] I am hopeful that we will return from here with so much learning and so much takings.
[06:59] You are not only students but friends as well. And in friendship some things are learned and some things are taught.
[07:07] Just keep one thing in mind that expensive cars, expensive dress don't make man a successful man
[07:18] If you know the skill to conquer the world through education and bright thinking then no matter if you are wearing a simple dress or a simple watch.
[07:26] People will be forced to respect you from bottom of their hearts.
[07:28] And remember one thing my friends that only pure and proper things comes true in every test of life.
[07:47] Can I help you?
No, we don't want to make you cry, we have brought you here as a chief guest.
[07:55] If you will deal with these coals then your eyes will get red and hands will become black.
[08:00] And we want to see Mrs. Khurshid Hasan shining and beautiful.
[08:06] Do you know what, if any job is done with love and sincerity then it doesn't make any difference whether eyes become red and hands black.
[08:15] So, give it to me.
[08:17] It's right.
Definitely.
[08:32] Just keep one thing in mind that expensive cars, expensive dress don't make man a successful man.
[08:43] If you know the skill to conquer the world through education and bright thinking then no matter if you are wearing a simple dress or a simple watch.
[08:50] People will be forced to respect you from bottom of their hearts.
[08:54] And remember one thing my friends that only pure and proper things comes true in every test of life.
[09:11] What are you thinking by sitting here alone?
[09:17] That how good you speak, everyone become quiet when you talk.
[09:25] I wish, I could speak like this.
[09:33] Do you know that silence has it's own language.
[09:38] Let me tell you one thing.
[09:52] You also say so much through your eyes.
[10:00] Just try to convert that into words.
[10:07] How long will this argument of saying or not saying anything?
[10:11] Until you become Rutba Khurshid Hasan instead of Rutba Meher Ali. Till that time this argument will go on.
[10:30] Both of you please come quickly, dinner is served.
[10:47] Altamash, you should have thought before slapping Azka.
[10:51] She is your aunt's daughter and now she has support of brother Meher Ali, she is not an ordinary, orphan girl who will bear this behavior of yours.
[11:01] I did the right thing. Uncle has given her a few acres, sometime she competes with me and sometime with Rutba.
[11:11] She doesn't understand that crown can't compete neither with swan nor with eagle.
[11:21] Be courageous my son.
[11:24] When sweeper marries to king then she becomes a queen and considers herself a queen.
[11:31] Be flexible, women treated gently not with strictness.
[11:38] She used to love me immensely.
[11:42] Now she is learning cleverness and sharpness. I did right to slap her and I have reminded her real worth to her.
[11:50] I have known her really well.
[11:55] The people who dream to rule the world by taking support of love they only get disability.
[12:01] Why are you talking like crazy? Come on, let's go and convince her to come back here.
[12:07] Now.
[12:09] Let her stay there for now.
[12:11] I am breathing freely now.
[12:14] Are you mad? What if brother Meher Ali knew about it?
So? What will uncle do?
[12:21] Uncle is not our ruler.
[12:23] Altamash doesn't listen to anyone. He says his words and listens to himself.
[12:44] I will have to convince Azka to come back here myself.
[13:06] I never did all of this Khurshid.
[13:09] I don't know why, I want to do all of this and I want that I know how to do it.
[13:15] I want that I know to do everything and then I want that there is someone, who is mine and I may do everything for him.
[13:24] Then I want that he would say that Rutba Meher Ali Khan you know the skill to win hearts.
[14:25] How are you?
I am fine.. Do I serve lunch?
[14:29] Has food arrived?
[14:32] No, and there is no need to either bring or ask someone to bring that ever again.
[14:35] I will cook that myself.
[14:37] Get fresh, I am serving lunch.
What?
[14:44] What do you mean by "What"?
[14:47] Why are you looking at me like this? Can't I cook food?
[14:52] Rutba, you can do everything, why will I under estimate you?
[14:57] Let me get fresh. I am starving.
[15:30] What happened?
[15:33] Nothing, I was thinking that why did you bother to cook all of this? I bring food daily.
[15:42] By eating that low quality food from that canteen. My taste buds are spoiled because of that. After eating that it seems like some butcher has cooked it.
[15:52] I have decided that whatever may happen, I will cook food myself.
[15:58] OK, as you wish.
[16:02] But don't complain later that I forced Rutba Meher Ali Khan to work in kitchen.
[16:08] Why will I complain for the work which I will do happily with my will?
But you signed the Nikah Nama (Marriage Certificate) happily with your will.
[16:19] What is this?
[16:22] Hey
[16:24] If you taunt me ever again on this matter then...
Then?
[16:31] Then you will have to eat the food of that canteen for the rest of your life.
No, please forgive me.
[16:39] I don't want to eat that canteen food for the rest of my life.
[16:41] Please return my precious food to me.
[16:47] I am very hungry.
[17:15] How is the food?
[17:18] It's like that if will have to eat this for the rest of my life then I won't complain.
[17:28] It's a lie.
[17:33] Our relation is based on this thing that neither I lie to you nor you lie to me.
[17:51] My hand.
[17:59] I will leave if you want.
[18:04] Are you compelled to obey me?
[18:11] You don't your own will?
[18:16] My will?
[18:37] I am afraid because the idols of ego have broken after clashing with stone idol.
[18:46] If this happened again then neither ego will remain nor the dignity. So I thought to obey the idol.
[18:59] How do you talk such difficult things?
If difficult things reach the heart then it feels good.
[19:10] Oho
[19:12] So you have the intention to reach the heart.
[19:18] And that too by feeding me canteen food daily.
[19:22] But you never said to me that Rutba let's go out for dinner at some good place. But you didn't say that as well.
[19:31] It means that if I will ask you then you will do that. You can't do anything on your own and can't say anything on your own.
[19:36] Rutba, I am going with students and will return in the evening. There is a good restaurant nearby, it's food is really good.
[19:45] Will you go there with me?
[19:57] I have cooked this food with so much difficulty, at least eat this.
[20:06] Have some more.
[20:27] Maybe we will get late on return.
[20:30] Rutba is alone here, what if you take care of her?
[20:33] You will have her thoughts whole day with you. I will just say hi to her.
[20:41] Thanks i will be really grateful to you.
[20:51] I think this house is haunted.
[20:54] Both sisters are behaving like enemies as if they are not my children but strangers.
[20:59] It maybe someone's bad wish.
[21:01] Go and advise your mad daughter that don't argue with me.
[21:05] Rather than to support me she spoils my mind more.
[21:11] My mind is spoiled by Altamash.
[21:14] My mental state is destroyed mom, how will I live my life?
[21:19] Greetings sister
Greetings, Azka my dear.
[21:23] You came here without informing me?
[21:26] If there was any problem and any complain then you should have told me.
[21:29] I am not a stranger, I am your aunt.
[21:33] Hmm
[21:37] Ronaq, you and Azka are only spring in my life.
[21:43] If you started to get angry due to such minor things than lest our happiness may get angry with us. Did you ever think about it.
[21:52] What will these emotional dialogues do aunt?
[21:55] The reality is this that Alatamash doesn't even know what is my importance in his life?
[22:00] Until Altamash won't give me respect and importance to me 
[22:04] till then I won't give importance to this relationship.
[22:07] In which tone your are talking to your aunt?
[22:09] I can't talk sweetly after getting that slap mom.
[22:14] I am here to apologize on behalf of Altamash.
[22:19] Let's go my child, don't get angry on such minor things.
[22:24] I am here to take you back. Go with me.
Sister there is no need of your apology.
[22:30] But this is not that minor thing that we can forget.
Azka is absolutely right.
[22:35] She will only go with Altamash.
[22:38] But, Altamash's apology is mandatory.
[22:41] And his promise that it won't happen again.
[22:45] You are right, he would definitely come but he has gone to visit lands and asked me to bring Azka back.
[22:55] My child it's our domestic matter and it will be resolved there as well.
[22:58] Let's go with me, good girl.
No aunt, Altamash will have to come to take me back.
[23:06] And he will have to apologize to me as well.
[23:23] Hello
Greetings Rutba, how are you?
[23:32] I am fine.
[23:33] I am happy.
[23:36] You should be happy.
[23:39] You have gone away from greed, cheating and lies.
[23:47] I have heard that you live in a small and ordinary house.
[23:52] You are lucky.
[23:55] You are living your life with peace, satisfaction and happiness.
What do you want to say? Say it clearly.
[24:02] Listen Rutba, you couldn't get married to Altamash and your Nikah also ended.
[24:11] Not only uncle's tricks and Altamash's foolishness was the reason for that but there is cleverness and conspiracies.
[24:22] Whose conspiracies?
My mom, I mean your aunt and Azka.
[24:40] Do you know, what are you saying?
[24:45] I know it very well what I am saying.
[24:50] Now listen that what has happened to you.
[24:58] Azka loves Altamash since her childhood.
[25:04] She didn't want to see anyone else with him.
[25:34] I thought that you should have known these things.
[25:38] So I told you.
[26:17] Rutba, where are documents and jewelry?
[26:21] I will safely take these to Altamash and aunt before your wedding.
[26:30] Where are documents and jewelry Rutba?
[26:33] You are taking Altamash's name who agreed to marry Azka in greed of getting the land and you want to sell yourself to that buyer?
[26:43] He is not that worthy.
[27:16] Excuse me I will be back.
[27:22] Greetings
[27:24] Greetings, how are you?
[27:25] Thanks to God, are your students ready?
[27:28] Yes students are ready as well as very excited.
[27:33] I am sure that you and your students will return victorious.
[27:37] God willing, I hope so.
[27:40] Miss Tazmeen, I wanted to request you.
[27:43] Go ahead.
[27:45] Actually, we can get late on return.
[27:49] Rutba is alone here, what if you take care of her.
[27:53] You will have Rutba's thoughts all day with you. I can just meet and greet her.
[28:00] Thanks, I will be really grateful to you.
[28:04] This bright face is telling good news, I think the trust of your relation and love is there.
[28:14] I didn't see such kind of smile on your face before today.
[28:20] The friends like you are a lucky charm for any person.
[28:25] Who understand the inner feeling without even saying or listening anything.
[28:28] You always supported me in sorrow as well as in happiness.
[28:32] Thank you so much.
[28:34] I am going, we are getting late. Take care of yourself. Bye.
[30:44] Greetings, what's up?
Is Mrs. Khurshid Hasan speaking?
[30:48] A guest name Mr. Altamash wants to meet you. Can I send him to your house?
[31:00] Mrs. Khurshid.
[31:04] Yes send him.
[31:49] How are you?
[31:58] Won't you ask me to come in?
[32:49] Rutba, this place is not up to your standards. How are you living your life here?
[32:58] The supports which considered mandatory to live, perhaps those were not important.
[33:06] People live in forests as well.
[33:10] But flowers die.
[33:16] Beautiful thing has it's own place.
[33:21] I am feeling sad to see you here in this condition.
[33:31] So why are you here, to see me in sorrow?
[33:41] I was going to visit lands then I thought to meet you.
[33:48] Perhaps I wanted to see this that do you want to see me or not?
[33:58] You asked me to come here, it means that you wanted to see me.
[34:07] Yes I wanted to see you.
[34:15] I wanted to see you from head to toe.
[34:21] I wanted to see that are you still that charming?
[34:29] Is there still same brightness in your eyes and magic in your words.
[34:36] I wanted to see that are you still the same Altamash whom Rutba Meher Ali khan loved immensely.
[35:08] Yes Rutba.
[35:11] I am the same Altamash who was crazy for you.
[35:17] And still loves you and wants to be your companion.
[35:24] Just say "Yes" once then we will go back to our world where there were only me and you.
[35:33] Where there was neither any Khurshid nor Azka.
[35:45] Is this possible Altamash?
[35:53] Of course
[35:56] Till breaths remain in our body and heartbeats in our hearts.
[36:05] Then everything is possible.
[36:08] Just say "Yes" once, I will make every impossible thing possible.
[36:28] Sorry
[36:31] Khurshid asked me to take care of you.
[36:40] Rutba, tell me if you need anything.
[36:48] Thanks miss Tazmeen, he is my cousin Altamash.
[36:54] He came here to meet me.
[36:57] But now.
[37:00] He is going back.
[37:22] Won't you see off till my car? We don't know when will we meet?
[37:37] Sure.
[38:02] Altamash, don't come here again.
[38:09] I allowed you to come because Khurshid was not at home, if he would have at home then you wouldn't get permission.
[38:18] You are Rutba Meher Ali.
[38:20] Are you scared of Khurshid?
[38:24] You wouldn't have informed Azka about it. She must be unaware of this.
[38:31] Everyone will know about this one day.
[38:35] Be brave.
[38:38] I have done so, that's why I have met with you otherwise I would think a hundred times before meeting you.
[38:53] I knew that Khurshid is not here that's why I came here without hesitancy.
[38:59] Next time I will call you before I come.
[39:06] By the way Rutba, to meet with me, you don't have to think. Just need to kill your ego nor your courage.
[39:49] Miss Tazmeen, I have a request from you. 
Yes, what's up?
[39:58] I don't want Khurshid to know about Altamash's visit.
[40:05] OK
Thank you. Thank you so much.
