[00:14] Khursheed, come quickly
[00:17] today you've become an orphan in real
[00:20] the one who used to protect you & save you from the bitterness of this world
[00:27] he has left this world 
[00:32] show me his face one last time
[00:35] show me his face once.. 
[00:38]  we won't be able to see him again ever
we will never be able to see him again
[00:44] tell them..
[01:07] yes Khursheed, I want to light up my house like this on the daily basis
[01:12] that's why I keep counting days daily for your return upon your return
[01:16] your welcome will be way too grand than this
[01:28] dear, you are so precious to me
[01:32] you have been with me in every happiness & sorrow
[01:37] if Rutba is my life then you are also precious to me like a son
[01:48] Mr. Khursheed, open the door
[01:52] Mr. Khursheed
[01:55] Mr. Khursheed...
[02:03] Mr. Khursheed, please open the door
[02:07] Mr. Khursheed!
[02:53] the love of our loved ones keep us alive
[02:57] but disloyalty kills 
[03:01] don't even think of being disloyal to Khursheed
[03:15] Rutba...
[03:17] its Khursheed's call, he wants to speak to you
[03:22] Khursheed wants to talk to me?
[03:29] come
[04:35] are you fine, Rutba?
[04:46] don't cry
[04:48] uncle's soul will be hurt
[04:55] I haven't cried as of yet
[05:00] but I am unable to stop my tears
[05:05] what shall I do?
[05:09] I can't bear it
[05:16] you are so lucky, as you were with him in his last moments
[05:25] I will keep searching for him for life time
[05:32] you are lucky Khursheed
[05:37] it is you whom dad was praising until his last breath
[05:47] its you, with whom dad was happy
[05:54] according to my agreement, I cannot come back to Pakistan before 6 months
[06:02] they aren't giving my passport
[06:06] No... you shouldn't come
[06:12] your studies will be affected
[06:17] I will try...
[06:24] Okay
[06:29] take care of yourself & my mother
[06:35] I will respect your every wish once I come back to Pakistan
[06:42] but until then you have to wait
[06:47] Bye!
[08:24] these are the documents of the property that uncle had kept with him
[08:27] my right!
[08:29] after all, until when it would have stayed away from me?
[08:34] sister, I must say that we shall search for the keys of the locker too
[08:38] don't know what not he must have kept in it. What if we don't get anything later
[08:44] anyways, whatever is written in one's fate he'll get it Ronaq
[08:49] by the way, for what you came here on the night of brother's demise?
[09:02] you want to marry Altamash after taking divorce from Khursheed
[09:11] Rutba remember... 
[09:15] if you did this
[09:19] then your father will stay upset in another world as well 
[09:25] what are you saying? There isn't any such thing, its all a lie
[09:30] there isn't any such thing. Who said this to you?
[09:37] if this is the matter then...
[09:41] shut the mouth of yours & mine enemies from my grave's mud
[09:56] I mean, what are such secretive talks that I don't know
[10:01] actually...
[10:01] what is happening here?
[10:04] Rutba, what had to happen?
[10:08] We are just recalling brother's memories
[10:12] the entire house is filled with his fragrance, so we were feeling it
[10:16] you are right
[10:19] honestly!
[10:22] this house is filled with my father's fragrance
[10:28] his memories are here
[10:33] but I can smell a lot more other things from this room
[10:46] and you!
[10:49] the mud of dad's grave is still fresh, Altamash
[10:53] but its good! Its good that you shall clear your dues right away
[11:02] I saw these files
[11:06] whatever is there in it is yours, dad has transferred it to your name. So you can keep it
[11:14] I am Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[11:19] highly respected & honorable like him
[11:25] don't you worry
[11:28] all of you will get so much
[11:35] if possible...
[11:38] do pray for my father
[12:11] now pick it up
[12:29] dear, life is the name of a short journey
[12:33] its the desire of every extinguishing lamp to lit a new lamp before it dies
[12:47] if Rutba is the beating heart in my chest then.. 
[12:53] you are the sight of my eyes.. 
[13:06] your thinking will be your light, Khursheed 
[13:09] due to which you'll see every path very clearly
[13:14] and education will be your weapon 
[13:17] nobody will be able to defeat you
[13:30] travel safe, Khursheed
[13:34]  its Mehr Ali's biggest desire to see his children on the highest position
[13:47] my prayers are always with you
[14:22] I don't want it
[14:28] put a rein on your emotions, Altamash
[14:33] my reins are in your hands, Rutba
[14:36] you may take me wherever you want to
[14:44] I won't become happy by your words only
[14:51] dad has died
[14:57] now I am not that Rutba Mehr Ali who was naive & stupid
[15:04] I have become a wise woman who makes decisions
[15:12] Congrats Rutba, on getting this position, this status... and this majestic grace
[15:24] all suits you
[15:29] I want a girl like Rutba Mehr Ali in my life
[15:36] Tell me, what as such I need to do that you shall enter in my life?
[15:43] and both of us can share our griefs & sorrows with each other
[15:47] dad has transferred his entire property & everything on my name
[15:52] So much that it would be difficult to handle
[15:58] the lawyer is sitting outside
[16:00] today on wards, everything will be mine legally
[16:05] but... neither I am miser or greedy
[16:10] that's why... 
[16:13] I have decided that...
[16:16] to give something to my dad's close relatives
[16:24] however I know that my father has already blessed them with a lot in prior
[16:31] So much that maybe they don't deserve it
[16:36] its such a good thing, Rutba
[16:39] he was such a big hearted person
[16:41] yes, that's why I want you to make your heart big
[16:46] and whatever I had said to you, and demanded
[16:50] whatever you have somehow, transfer it on my name
[16:53] See, this way I will start trusting you. Ok?
[17:03] there is no need to worry in it
[17:06] will you marry me immediately if I do this?
[17:11] what is the guarantee that you'll take divorce from Khursheed & he will divorce you immediately?
[17:17] As I said, why are you worrying?
[17:23] whatever matters are there between me & Khursheed, I will sort them myself
[17:30] See, whatever is mine will be eventually yours after our marriage
[17:36] everything!
[17:39] and here you are getting worried for your small property
[17:42] I am not worried Rutba, I just need your companionship
Altamash please... 
[17:46] control yourself!
[17:50] there are people here
[17:53] its better to control yourself until a decision is made
[18:02] the lawyer is waiting for me outside
[18:06] we'll meet later
you may go now
[18:15] I'm leaving
[18:32] Why are you getting blind in her love?
[18:35] Now I don't see that innocence & simplicity on her face
[18:40] earlier, I used to see attraction in her eyes
[18:44] but now, I only see hatred!
[18:46] earlier, she only used to look
[18:50] now she just thinks
[19:07] aunty, have you told them for the car?
[19:09] yes dear, I have told them. Are you going somewhere?
[19:12] yes, I am going to the university
[19:14] already there has been a huge loss of studies, and I don't want to drop any course
[19:20] dear, I wanted to discuss something important with you
[19:23] yes yes, go ahead
[19:25] its not right for Altamash to come here on daily basis
[19:31] I accept that he is your cousin & he comes to inquire about your well being but...
[19:37] its not appropriate for him to visit here in Khursheed's absence
[19:42] We cannot stop people tongue & looks..
[19:47] dear look, Khursheed is as simple & innocent as you are
[19:53] everyone is not like you guys
[19:55] you won't get to know when they stab you on your back
[20:00] you are right
[20:02] I will ask Altamash to stay cautious
[20:06] Bye!
bye!
[20:39] everyone is not like you guys
[20:41] you won't get to know when they stab you on your back
[20:52] whatever is written in one's fate he'll get it Ronaq
[20:56] by the way, for what you came here on the night of brother's demise?
[21:03] I mean, what are such secretive talks that I don't know
[21:16] you are falsifying me, but how will you falsify yourself?
[21:21] look at your video for once
[21:27] I will bend down my head & become quiet, but how will you shut the mouth of the people around you?
[21:36] I beg you..
[21:39] don't fall from your status to an extent that the people associated to you shall also fall
[21:44] it doesn't make any difference to you but your Honorable father will die
[22:34] what are you saying, Altamash?
[22:36] why Rutba had to keep this condition? What does she lack now?
[22:41] trust & belief
[22:43] she is afraid of believing on me & my love
[22:48] and why she shouldn't be scared?
[22:50] She had paid a very heavy price of my stupidities
[22:54] how would I know that what kind of hypocrite & diplomatic people are hiding behind honest faces
[23:02] my blood boils when I get to know about it now
[23:06] listen Altamash! don't consider the path of your life easy until Khursheed & Rasheeda are in Rutba's life
[23:16] if Rutba is honest, then she has to remove both of them from her life before coming near to us
[23:22] Do tell her!
[23:25] if she has a condition, then we also have a condition
[23:30] We will not put our everything on the stake so easily!
[23:52] I had warned you not to do this act earlier as well
[23:55] She has got his habit from her mother
[23:59] this girl is exactly like her mother
[24:02] She is the same woman, the one who is sly & creates fuss
[24:06] Great! Both of you mother son duo do the conspiracies & yet me and my mother is sly & clever!
[24:13] I also want to hear the plans that you guys were making here
[24:19] what as such is the matter that both of you are hiding from me?
[24:22] hmm... as if you & your mother doesn't hide anything?
[24:26] Tell me, why Ronaq had gone to meet brother Mehr Ali before his death?
[24:32] what you guys have got secretly? And here we are unaware of everything!
[24:37] mom had gone to ask uncle to explain Rutba
[24:43] to stay away from Altamash
[24:46] she wants to save my marriage, and what's wrong in it?
[24:51] or either all of us shall put a blind fold on our eyes & look at the spectacle of Altamash & Rutba's love?
[24:55] you & your mother had seen the spectacle of Rutba & Altamash's love story once before
[25:01] have you forgotten?
[25:03] the people who likes to see the spectacle, becomes a spectacle themselves
[25:12] Altamash
[25:15] please forget the past
[25:18] today's reality is that, I am your wife
[25:23] and Rutba is Khursheed's wife
[25:27] you are about to become a father, our family will be completed
[25:35] I have already given you my everything
[25:39] whatever I had
[25:42] still you don't value me
[25:49] don't humiliate me in front of Rutba
[25:52] I beg you. You can strangle me to death with your own hands but don't make me fall in Rutba's feet
[25:57] one more drama!
[26:00] Azka, please don't compel me to take any big step
[26:07] I won't do any injustice with you
[26:12] until you don't want it yourself
[27:59] Arfa, how are you?
[28:03] I am so upset since I heard the news of uncle's death
[28:12] it feels as if there is no more protection on my head
[28:18] not only you...
[28:21] but everyone who is coming to meet me is saying the same thing
[28:24] honestly speaking, after dad's demise I had started to love him even more
[28:31] dad was such a strong tree with a shadow who wasn't concerned about the fact that who is good or bad, who is the loved one or stranger
[28:39] the tree only knows how tall & honorable it was
[28:48] I am trying to come back
[28:52] soon I will meet you
[28:56] your grief is really big
[29:00] I was thinking that don't know what you must be doing after your father's demise
[29:08] I am trying to become like him
[29:14] He used to smile courageously even after suffering through a very big grief
[29:21] I am practicing
[29:25] but it feels as if it will take ages
[29:32] take very good care of yourself
[29:37] so much of love & prayers from my side
[29:41] you also take very good care of yourself
[29:43] Bye!
[30:13] Rutba...
[30:15] drink milk, you haven't eaten anything in the night as well. This way you'll become unwell
[30:21] you care about me a lot
[30:24] why not? After all, you are my sister's mandate
[30:28] and my Khursheed's love
[30:33] aunty, you were telling me that you wanted to build a madarsa (religious school) in the village
[30:43] dear, I am not very well educated
[30:46] I just teach the holy Quran to the kids
[30:50] and your father had given me this courage as well
[30:54] he used to say that at every age..
[30:59] a person's spark shall always stay lit like a lamp
[31:04] until it doesn't extinguishes
[31:09] I have also decided
[31:12] that I will go over there to keep the basis of school & university
[31:18] now I know
[31:20] that what I have to do with my life in the future
[31:23] are you serious, Rutba? You have said the words of my heart
[31:27] even I wish the same, our thinking is quite similar
[31:33] we have a few lands of Khursheed's father
[31:36] I had thought that I will start the construction over there once Khursheed will be stabled in his life
[31:42] its such a good news aunty, then go there & start the construction
[31:47] on whose name the lands are?
[31:49] dear, its on my name & I have written it in the charity for the children education
[31:55] then let me send the architect & engineers
[31:58] you & I together shall start this pious work
[32:01] but aunty please, don't discuss this matter with Khursheed right now
[32:06] I want to do this work on my basis
[32:10] on my dad's name
[32:13] don't you worry at all. Today on wards just consider this land as yours
[32:19] you can do whatever you feel like..
[32:58] yes?
[33:00] mom, I have got the biggest happiness of my life
[33:04] Tell me
[33:07] its a boy
[33:09] All praise to God. Heartiest congratulations to you!
[33:18] Azka, God has listened to us. You have won this battle as well
[33:23] you'll see what will happen next, only you will get the success
[33:27] Really!
[33:28] Thanks to God!
lets go, come on
[33:39] mom, please give me the documents. Its already very late
[33:43] the lawyer must be waiting, you know such matters takes so much of time
[33:48] if Bazil Khan gets to know about it, then he'll become very furious
[33:52] You know right, that wealth, lands & properties are like a mother to Bazil Khan
[33:59] equivalent to a mother!
[34:01] when he'll get to know that you are about to transfer all these things in Rutba's name, then ...
[34:06] he'll become mad & crazy in anger
[34:09] mom... he is my father. And I know him very well
[34:16] even for me, lands & wealth is most important than any other relation
[34:20] but see, if a businessman bends down then he does it after looking at the shine of the coin
[34:26] what is the importance of all these things in front of whatever Rutba has
[34:30] Once I get Rutba, then not only this house but Mehr Ali house will be ours too
[34:40] what are you doing here?
[34:42] madam, sir had ordered tea
[34:45] keep it
[34:50] why are you standing here now? You have kept the tea, now leave!
[34:57] Okay, now quickly give me the documents
[34:59] I am giving them, have some patience
[35:09] here are the complete documents of this house
[35:13] I can see Rutba's beautiful companionship in it
[35:16] there is no need to become so insane! 
Why are you getting blind in her love?
[35:23] Now I don't see that innocence & simplicity on her face
[35:28] earlier, I used to see attraction in her eyes
[35:31] but now, I only see hatred!
[35:34] earlier, she only used to look
[35:38] now she just thinks
[35:41] mom...
[35:43] I am Altamash
[35:45] even today I can read Rutba's face & eyes
[35:51] she can get angry with me for sure
[35:54] but she can never be disloyal
[35:58] Rutba cannot live without love
[36:03] and Altamash's love is that magnet which can attract Rutba from anywhere in the world
[36:12] there was just one wall between us
[36:16] Mehr Ali Khan!
[36:19] and now he is no more...
[36:23] I'm leaving...
[36:46] maam Rutba!
[36:47] yes?
somebody is here to meet you
[36:49] you go, and don't come back until we are done talking
[36:55] the same posture, the same accent, the same arrogance... just like Altamash
[37:03] you have really done true love with Altamash
[37:07] of-course I did true love with him, that's why what not I did to get him
[37:12] true that
[37:13] you had told so many lies, also you did a lot of conspiracies in order to get him
[37:18] you had fallen from your status
[37:22] I wish, you could have understood that everyone gets whatever is written in their fate
[37:28] if you hadn't done these conspiracies, or you hadn't lied then still..
[37:35] Altamash would have been yours today!
[37:41] Altamash is mine & he will always stay mine
[37:44] that's why, I am here to explain you for the last time that don't make a mistake of coming in between me & Altamash
[37:50] otherwise, neither I will stay in peace nor I will let you stay in peace
[37:54] oho! now I have understood
[37:58] So whatever conspiracies you have done, in fact recently
[38:03] the way you had called Khursheed, sent him the video. And don't know what lies you have told him
[38:11] you did all that because of this?
[38:15] do you know
[38:17] I think Altamash is just an excuse
[38:23] actually you have a problem with me
[38:26] from my happiness & from my success
[38:29] you are jealous of it
[38:33] and how come it doesn't happen?
[38:35] because you have inherited all this
[38:39] I haven't come here to give you any justification
[38:42] in fact, I have come to give you a good news
[38:46] I am about to give a heir to Altamash
[38:49] and after that of-course, Altamash will only be mine
[39:00] are you here to give me a challenge?
[39:04] challenge accepted!
