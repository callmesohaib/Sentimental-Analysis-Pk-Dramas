[00:14] I want to feel the sentiment of your love
[00:18] I want that sight with whom you see Rutba 
[00:22] the smile that comes on your face by looking at her
[00:31] I am ready to transfer Saeedpur's land in your name
[00:38] in return, I just want your support
[00:58] I hope I am not disturbing you
[01:00] No no, please come
[01:02] its good you came, I was drinking coffee all alone
[01:08] shall I make some for you?
[01:09] please
[01:13] So... how is your experience so far?
[01:17] hmm... very nice
[01:20] a new world, a new life... a new matter at every moment
[01:25] this process of going on further in your life is quite important, right?
[01:30] a human only learns when he starts walking
[01:34] thanks!
[01:35] absolutely!
[01:37] and I think, we'll take back a lot with us whenever we'll go back from here
[01:44] absolutely correct!
[01:46] its very important for us to do something for our people
[01:51] after seeing the lights here I have realized, that our people are living in so dark
[01:56] the difference of system, behavior, society... 
[02:02] I feel amazed to see all this, also I feel deserted too
[02:07] everything will become fine, if you change this solitude of yours into your passion
[02:15] correct!
[02:18] its very important to do something for our people after going back
[02:22] one is alone, but two are equal to eleven
[02:25] don't you worry! You will find Tazmeen Ansari with you in every turn of your life
[02:38] I shall take your leave now as I have to make some notes for a very important class
[02:41] Yes yes.. 
[02:42] Bye... 
[03:35] Okay
[03:37] I am signing them
[03:39] but remember one thing, these are not only signatures
[03:43] in fact, they are handcuffs which I am putting on your love for me
[03:47] uncle had said that all of these lands & its wealth is only mine
[03:51] the documents will always stay on my name, Altamash will not have any concern with it 
[03:58] but I am giving importance to your words over uncle's words
[04:04] you also promise me that... 
[04:07] you'll never give importance to Rutba over me
[04:13] your position will always stay with you
[04:17] Rutba can never come on your position
[04:26] now do the signatures, my love
[04:29] the lawyer is waiting downstairs
[05:18] yes Rutba, it was my dream to see you  like this with me
[05:25] the meaning of every dream is not good
[05:31] then tell your dreams that Altamash writes the meaning of his dreams himself
[05:37] today we are having food together
[05:40] tomorrow we'll spend our life together
[05:45] nothing is impossible!
[05:50] all that is possible that we decide
[06:26] don't look at me like this
[06:31] neither this face is for you, nor these eyes are for me
[06:38] we have already tested each other
[06:42] we have lost each other
[06:46] we have lost in the fake game of love as well
[06:49] now we are sitting here to celebrate our defeat
[07:01] thank you!
[07:09] Rutba
[07:14] its true that we had lost each other
[07:19] but to loose or to give up
[07:23] both of them are different things
[07:29] you came to celebrate defeat
[07:36] Never!
[07:41] Altamash came to begin victory
[07:48] he came to start the game once again, whose ending is not as per his desire
[08:01] whose life was a game for you?
[08:05] yours.. or mine?
[08:12] Rutba, forget the past
[08:15] I promise you, I will repent your every grief & pain
[08:24] what else will you do?
[08:29] will you give my griefs & my pains to Azka?
[08:37] I don't want this
[08:41] I don't want to give anything to Azka
[08:46] neither love.. 
[08:48] nor trust... 
[08:50] nor grief... 
[08:51] and neither pain
[08:56] I will do whatever you will say
[09:00] the decision of Azka's life will be in your hands
[09:11] you have to decide to come into my life
[09:17] I have already decided
[09:21] now... 
[09:24] what do you intend to do for me?
[09:28] I am ready to do everything for you
[09:32] I will do whatever you'll say
[09:36] you just have to take a divorce from Khursheed
[10:33] why are you roaming around like this? 
shouldn't Altamash go out of the house now?
[10:40] he had gone out of the house, but why he has switched off his phone?
[10:46] I know why he has switched it off
[10:48] because he knew that I will call him
[10:51] Also, he was talking to a girl before leaving
[10:53] he was asking her to come on time
[10:56] who else can be that girl except for Rutba?
[10:58] how do you know that what was he talking about with whom, & at what time?
[11:05] even the walls have ears, aunty
there is always a proof of a crime
[11:13] then say it that now you'll spy on us in this house as well
[11:19] its your habit since childhood, to talk about one thing at another place & vice versa
[11:24] I know you very well
[11:26] its your upbringing since childhood. But this won't be catered in this house!
[11:31] what do you think? I will fire all the servants on the spot who are creating misunderstandings
[11:37] why are you getting so hyper?
[11:39] if Altamash is doing anything wrong then you should be supporting me, not him
[11:45] and how can you talk about my upbringing?
[11:48] I think Altamash's upbringing is not done in the right way
[11:52] he doesn't even know that what position a wife holds in the life of an Innocent man
[11:59] how unfortunate I am!
[12:04] that I have brought a girl with such a bad tongue to my house as my daughter-in-law
[12:09] I had thought that she is my niece, she will respect me
[12:15] but how would I know that she is ready to snatch away my shelter from me
[12:22] my brother's daughter Rutba was way too better than you
[12:27] She had never talked to me in such a tone or manner
[12:34] Rutba... Rutba... Rutba!
[12:37] how many times I have told you guys that I am fed of this name!
[12:39] Azka! be quiet
[12:43] don't you dare to utter a single word from your mouth
[12:48] how are you talking to your aunt?
[12:51] enough of your misbehavior! You don't care about your elder aunt as well
[12:56] who had brought you in this house after marrying with so much of respect & honor
[13:02] don't stay in any delusion, mom
[13:05] all of this love is not because of honor
[13:08] in fact, its because of the greed of Saeedpur's lands
[13:13] it was the greed of that land, which has compelled her to do all this
[13:21] uncle's favor has exposed so many faces in one go
[13:34] I have also transferred the lands on Altamash's name
[13:36] what!
[13:39] what not I did in his love?
[13:43] I did everything, mom
I did whatever he had asked me to do
[13:49] what not I did for him?
[13:52] still he went to meet Rutba
[13:54] Azka... 
[13:58] Azka..
I can't tolerate this, mom
[14:01] Azka
[14:01] something is happening to me, mom
Okay, control yourself
[14:06] what happened? Azka.. Azka!
[14:09] dear, open your eyes
sister!
[14:11] sister, check what happened to her
oh Zahida!
[14:13] Bashir, where are you guys?
[14:16] Azka.. 
open your eyes
[14:19] dear, open your eyes
sister, what happened to her?
[14:37] explain your daughter, Ronaq
[14:39] she doesn't have a tongue in her mouth but flogs
[14:43] she beats the other person with it
[14:47] how will this marriage continue?
[14:50] leave it, at least you shall talk to her according to the situation
[14:56] and I saw Altamash, how he wanders around Rutba like a crazy lover
[15:01] and my daughter is getting upset about it
[15:06] honestly speaking, I don't care if you mind. I was never in the favor to transfer Saeedpur's lands on Altamash's name
[15:13] it was Azka's decision
[15:15] even after that Altamash went to meet Rutba, how disappointing!
[15:20] this is what I am explaining to you mother & daughter
[15:24] Azka just had those lands as her weapon
[15:27] now if she has lost that weapon, then she shall save these tears & attitude for the rainy days
[15:35] there is no need to show attitude in front of Altamash
[15:39] she should stay relaxed. Rutba is Khursheed Hasan's wife
[15:45] and daughter of Mehr Ali Khan
[15:48] She knows her status
[15:51] she will not take any wrong step
[15:54] anyways sister... 
[15:57] if Altamash doesn't love my daughter, then at least he can show some pity on her
[16:33] Greetings!*
[16:38] I am feeling so happy to see you, that I can't tell you
[16:41] I also feel very nice to see you
[16:45] I only wanted to meet those people who feel happy to see me
[16:49] that's why I couldn't go to meet mom & Azka while leaving
[16:54] this truth & right is such a weird thing
[16:57] you have to loose your relations in order to save your conscience
[17:01] hmm... 
[17:03] we have the best example of my father here
[17:07] he had never compromised on his conscience
[17:10] and neither on his relations
[17:13] but still, even after a lot had happened
[17:19] an air's life has always been a river of fire
[17:24] I am so ashamed
[17:26] that I had supported them
[17:30] leave it, you came after so long & see what we are discussing. Come with me
[17:35] Tell me, why you came alone? Why you haven't brought Hamdan along?
[17:39] He would have come for sure, but there was an emergency & he had to leave
[17:45] and this is not our first meeting, maybe it can be our last meeting as well
[17:50] what do you mean?
[17:53] Hamdan & I are going to Germany
[17:56] Hamdan has got a job there
[17:59] don't know after how long we'll meet again
[18:03] by the way, where is uncle?
[18:05] dad has gone to the village
[18:08] he stays unwell
[18:10] but still he never leaves traveling
[18:13] it feels as if traveling has become the chain of his feet
[18:19] you don't know Rutba
[18:23] what memories are still there, which keeps uncle so restless
[18:31] still there are a lot of matters that you don't know
[18:53] yes, its true... its true that I had married her to teach her a lesson
[18:58] when Arfa had told me that she used to love me since childhood
[19:05] I had understood at that time that both mother daughter duo are responsible for separating Rutba from me
[19:11] yes
[19:14] even I had a doubt
[19:17] but what to do?
[19:19] if I would have said something, then I would have lost my sister along with my brother
[19:27] Ronaq is like that since childhood
[19:30] if you don't get something, snatch it
[19:34] whoever seems superior, snatch away the land beneath its feet
[19:42] do you know, she is the one who had ruined brother Mehr Ali's life too
[19:46] she had never let him & sister Sajida stay in peace
[19:51] she had always sown the seeds of misunderstandings & hatred
[20:00] furthermore, I used to come into her words as well
[20:04] I used to support her
[20:11] anyways leave it, all of these are old matters
[20:15] they have become the part of our past
[20:17] forget it...
no mom!
[20:22] we cannot hide the actions of the people who deceives
[20:29] such people are made an example!
[20:32] we set an example of such people
[20:36] Altamash!
[20:40] don't forget that she is about to give birth to your family's heir
[20:45] also remember, that your family is quite unfortunate about heir
[20:52] She has also transferred her lands on your name
[20:56] enough is enough! Forget Rutba now
[21:01] whatever you have got with luck, stay happy on it
[21:06] otherwise, you'll loose whatever you have got already
[21:12] Heir... lands... Mehr Ali's wealth & Rutba
[21:21] Wow mom!
[21:26] Altamash is getting so much
[22:12] I was just thinking that how to make tomorrow's notes
[22:17] Did you talk to Rutba?
[22:29] I didn't get the time
[22:39] my mother & aunt never used to like Mehr Ali uncle
[22:43] they only used to hate him
[22:46] it was maybe due to lack of education
[22:50] due to which they were unable to accept the right thing & truth
[22:56] uncle did love marriage with aunt Sajida
[23:01] she belonged to a very poor family
[23:05] they were relatives
[23:08] so uncle liked her
[23:12] but still my mother & aunt never liked her
[23:18] how do you know all this?
[23:24] I have been hearing all of this since my childhood
[23:30] they had never let aunt Sajida live peacefully
[23:34] they used to create problems for her one after the other
[23:42] you were quite small
[23:44] when your mother was diagnosed cancer
[23:47] maybe she was very sensitive
[23:51] she was matric pass
[23:55] but she couldn't tolerate the politics of our house's uneducated & conspiratorial women
[24:02] maybe that's why
[24:05] that's why she had died so early leaving behind you & uncle 
[24:11] you had got aunt Rashida's support
[24:15] but uncle.. 
[24:17] it seems as if he had experienced such a deep grief
[24:23] he was upset upon the fact that he couldn't give aunt Sajida the real happiness that she had deserved 
[24:42] Rutba, that's why... 
[24:44] that's why uncle loves your from the bottom of his heart
[24:49] and that's why he didn't remarried
[24:54] Arfa
[24:58] I was so unaware
[25:02] a lot had been happening around me, and I was never aware of it
[25:09] because Rutba, uncle never wanted to put any sort of burden on you
[25:14] he had kept all the secrets in his heart
[25:19] and here I am 
[25:23] who grew up in between all such matters & conspiracies
[25:30] I came to tell this to you, Rutba
[25:33] that I am going way too far from all these conspiracies & I am very happy
[25:39] I came to explain you the same thing
[25:42] conspiracies have never suited anyone
[25:47] people forget it
[25:49] but time never forgets
[25:56] that's why, you also never become a part of these conspiracies
[26:35] Mr. Khursheed
[26:37] May I come in?
yes yes
[26:40] I have brought soup for you
[26:44] oh wow! I needed it so badly
[26:49] you don't seem fine
[26:53] I don't feel fine myself
[26:58] its a little fever, also I am feeling a bit cold
[27:02] oho! shall I give you a tablet? I keep medicines with me for the safe side
[27:07] please
[27:08] oho! but you cannot take it on an empty stomach. Start drinking soup, meanwhile let me bring it
[27:12] thank you!
[27:29] take your medicine
[27:38] thank you!
[27:42] let me give you a cup of coffee, you will feel better
[27:46] God willing, soon you'll feel much better
[27:58] oh ms. Tazmeen, please leave it. I will do it myself
[28:01] its alright, you shall take rest. Let me do it today, tomorrow on wards you can do it yourself
[28:06] why are you making me ashamed?
[28:09] friends are there to help each other
[28:14] thank you!
[29:16] thank you so much, Ms. Tazmeen
[29:20] you gave me a courage to get up & sit. Also to think
[29:28] I was just thinking that how to make tomorrow's notes
[29:34] did you talk to Rutba?
[29:46] I didn't get the time
[29:49] Khursheed, you should talk to Rutba
[29:53] she is your wife
[29:55] decrease in commutations increases misunderstandings
[30:01] its a friend's sincere advice
[30:07] I've grown tired
[30:12] it feels as if there is some desert of very hot sand
[30:18] and the journey is never ending
[30:26] I just want the destination to be in front of my eyes as soon as I open them
[30:45] I shall take your leave now. If you need anything then do call me
[30:49] Actually I have to prepare the notes as well, therefore I will be awake until late night
[30:54] yes
[31:04] good night!
[31:34] who said all this to you, Rutba?
[31:42] tell me the name of that person
[31:45] dad, please tell me about
[31:50] those relations whom I had respected a lot in my entire life
[31:58] were they really so hypocrite,
[32:02] conspiratorial & impostor?
[32:10] Rutba, I never wanted that you shall also not believe on the relations like I do
[32:21] relations are like a flowing blood
[32:24] they are heartbeat
[32:27] they are breaths
[32:31] a life becomes beautiful if your trust stay intact on the relations
[32:39] I wanted to win this battle but.. 
[32:46] I lost
[32:48] no dad
[32:52] you won
[32:59]  to fulfill your ugly relations beautifully is the biggest achievement of a person 
[33:06] and you did this in such a pretty manner
[33:13] I do feel the pain of my mother's demise
[33:20] but you gave me that love as well that you had with her
[33:25] I don't have any complain with you
[33:32] it can be a person's compulsion to fulfill your love with the alive people, but you...
[33:40] you had shown how to fulfill your love with dead people as well
[33:50] do you know
[33:53] I am proud of only one thing in my life
[34:00] and that is... 
[34:03] that I am Rutba Mehr Ali Khan
[34:06] Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[34:46] here you go Azka, drink the juice
[34:48] mom, I really don't feel like drinking it. Please don't insist me
[34:51] Azka, why are you doing this?
[34:54] Azka, you have to take care of your health & your baby's health
[34:58] drink it, take one sip come on
[35:04] Azka look...
[35:07] your future life is dependent on this baby
[35:12] drink it
[35:16] Azka look..
[35:19] no matter how high a man intends to fly, but eventually the kids becomes the chain of his feet
[35:25] you have no idea that how powerful you are about to become
[35:29] not just one Rutba, even thousands of Rutba cannot compete you
[35:34] don't consider yourself weak at all
[35:38] and yes, tomorrow night Arfa is going to Germany
[35:45] she may go to hell from my side. Don't take her name in front of me
[35:49] I had told you earlier as well, not to talk about your sister like this
[35:53] what's with you? She is your only sister, why so much of hatred with her?
[35:57] why do you used to hate your siblings? 
until today...
[36:01] why do you say that they have ruined your life?
[36:03] Ok quiet! There is no need to discuss such things here. And that too so loudly
[36:08] stay in your senses
[36:10] whatever I have suffered through, after that I don't care about anyone
[36:22] what is happening with you?
[36:24] I should also know something
[36:26] are you sitting on the foot path? Don't you get anything to eat?
[36:31] don't you have a scarf to cover your head?
[36:34] you should be praying for your uncle, who has ignored your mother's mistakes & stupidities
[36:39] therefore you are sitting on this position today
[36:42] and be thankful to your aunt, that she had convinced Altamash to marry you
[36:49] nobody appreciates good work here
[36:52] and the person doing a favor is considered as an enemy
[36:55] did we kept a condition on your marriage that Altamash will love you madly after marriage?
[37:03] Ok enough, sister!
[37:05] why do you keep scolding my daughter at all times? Why are you getting angry?
[37:08] can't you see her condition? She is on the bed rest right now
[37:13] instead of taking care of her, you are scolding her
[37:16] Enough! I cannot tolerate this anymore
[37:24] this is my house, not the house of conspiracies
[37:30] oh wow!
[37:33] this is great aunty!
[37:36] Greetings!*
[37:38] my dear...
[37:40] this is your house, not Mehr Ali house that it will be a house of conspiracies
[37:45] right Azka?
[37:49] my dear, my life... I feel so satisfied after seeing you
[37:55] how are you  aunt Ronaq?
[37:57] I'm fine
[38:01] what happened Azka? I heard you are not well
[38:06] since you are not well so I thought to inquire about your health
[38:09] what happened?
[38:11] Altamash's companionship didn't suited you?
[38:16] who told you that I am not well?
[38:18] Altamash told me...
