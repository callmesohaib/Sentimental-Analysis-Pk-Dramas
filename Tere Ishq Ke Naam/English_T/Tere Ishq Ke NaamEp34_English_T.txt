[00:31] Rutba, you cannot do this. Uncle's everything is only mine
[00:38] are you listening? Are you getting my point?
[00:47] did you hear me, Altamash?
[01:04] Khursheed! 
[01:09] what did you just said?
[01:13] you really like to create a scene, and insulting people!
[01:19] you didn't even think of your father once? 
[01:22] I did all this to take the revenge of my father's grief
[01:32] whatever I did with them, they deserve it! 
[01:37] I don't think so that I have done anything wrong
[01:40] You use your father's name in order to calm down the fire of your hatred
[01:45] you should be ashamed 
[01:48] after deceiving people, doing false promises of wedding & gathering so many people. Then you say that you did all this for your father!
[01:56] No... 
[01:58] you did all of this to satisfy your false ego
[02:03] and for that you had lied big time that I am feeling ashamed while thinking of it
[02:08] lie? 
[02:13] which lie have I told?
[02:18] tell me, which lie? 
[02:19] why did you tell everyone that I had divorced you?
[02:30] Answer me!
[03:32] this! What is this? Tell me
[03:36] Answer me, what is this?
[03:39] my last mandate, after which all the doors between you & me have been closed
[03:45] after that Rutba Mehr Ali has died for you forever. 
Tell me what is this? Answer me
[03:59] these are the documents of those properties that your father had transferred on my name
[04:05] they wanted you to always stay happy
[04:09] and these properties were for your happiness
[04:12] it was your mandate, that's why I have returned it to you
[04:18] and I can't even think about giving divorce to you, Rutba
[04:23] how can I break the promise done to uncle?
[04:28] but I had already decided that the day you'll ask me to divorce you, I won't refuse
[04:38] because he had said that always keep Rutba happy
[04:41] So, you had married Tazmeen in order to make me happy
[04:47] who said this to you?
[04:49] answer me
[04:51] think whatever you want to
[04:54] you can disappoint me on the basis of a lie & fraud but still I have some rights on you
[05:01] and I am not Altamash, who will make black white & white black for the greed of money & properties
[05:11] I know
[05:16] I won't compel you
[05:20] and neither I will restrict you for myself
[05:27] You.. 
[05:30] If you want to go, then you may leave. I won't stop you
[05:41] In fact you may go, Tazmeen must be waiting for you
[06:30] I was unable to decide whether I should go or not
[06:35] It was difficult for me to go
[06:40] and now its difficult for me to stay here
[07:50] you haven't eaten anything since morning
[07:55] earlier, in the joy of marriage and then
[07:59] because of the grief of not getting married
[08:04] drink tea, your headache will lessen
[08:11] Rutba has betrayed me big time
[08:15] I can't believe
[08:24] I don't understand what to do. It seems as if I will go mad
[08:47] you are giving me so much
[08:51] the property documents... In fact, you've put Azka's jewelry in my feet
[08:59] But, I have nothing to give you
[09:31] Rutba has returned all this
[09:38] Saeedpur's lands, Sheikhupura's factory
[09:42] and the documents of this house
[10:17] so Rutba has given the charity
[10:25] but she has transferred everything on my name
[10:32] but don't you worry, whenever you'll say I will transfer it on your name
[10:38] Greed, and fight on the matters of lands & wealth
[10:42] I've seen the consequences of it very well
[10:47] I don't want to get into all this
[10:53] Rutba Mehr Ali Khan spits on your fake love, and on your conservative thinking
[11:01] Get lost from here!
[11:03]  because today, Rutba Mehr Ali Khan has taken her father's revenge
[11:10] keep these documents in the locker
[11:26] Let me go & inform mom & dad about it
[11:32] the will be the ones who will be the happiest
[11:43] I don't care!
[11:56] Stay happy & happily married in your house with your husband
[12:34] repeat it in a loud voice
greetings aunty!
[12:38] Greetings! hey Rutba...

[15:38] Aunty, I don't need any sort of facilities or relief

[22:04] It was my heart's desire to open a school & college in this area, it was my dream
[22:12] thank you for making my dream come true
[22:20] I haven't done this to show off or to satisfy my ego
[22:53] hey Rutba!
[22:54] Greetings!

[23:46] there is no matter of competition, Rutba
[23:49] You have already won without any competition
[24:01] Ok mom, have you made an arrangement for lunch or not?
[24:05] I am so hungry, and I had told you to make something special
[24:07] I have prepared a very delicious food on the wood fire & in the traditional oil
[24:12] and Zahida has sent very delicious rice. Shehzadi is making a traditional dessert
[24:17] Let me go & ask them to prepare piping hot flat breads
[24:20] wow mom, you've done such a great arrangement
[24:23] shall I come along?
No, you sit
[24:25] Let me serve the lunch
[24:28] I knew it that my son must be hungry
[24:43] it seems that both of you are meant for each other
[25:10] You couldn't understand me, although we have been together for so long
[25:20] but no complains... 
[25:23] you couldn't understand Khursheed Hassan as well
[25:49] Rutba, why are you sitting here alone?
[25:54] what else shall I do, aunty?
[25:57] I am all alone
[26:00] may your enemies be alone
[26:03] the guests are sitting outside, go sit with them
[26:08] since when Khursheed has become a guest?
[26:10] Khursheed is the host, my dear
[26:13] Tazmeen came to our village for the first time after her marriage
[26:17] and her husband is a complete stranger
[26:21] its our duty to serve our guests & to take care of them
[26:28] Go, sit with them. Laugh, smile & talk to them
[26:33] Let me do the arrangement for the tea
[26:37] Go my dear, sit with them
[26:47]  I can't even think about giving divorce to you, Rutba
[26:51] how can I break the promise done to uncle?
[26:54] because he had said that always keep Rutba happy
you had married Tazmeen in order to make me happy
[27:01] who said this to you?
[27:03] answer me
[27:06] think whatever you want to
[27:48] Come Rutba, sit
[27:55] Rutba, he is Basit
[27:58] Ms. Tazmeen's husband
[28:00] and Basit, she is Rutba. My wife..
[28:07] he was the third person in our group for the course in UK
[28:13] don't know what happened to him & he proposed me
[28:17] and your husband Khursheed was after me to say "yes"
[28:28] Tell her, whether we are compatible or not?
[28:32] We are so compatible, all praise to God
[28:39] Mom, Ms. Tazmeen & Basit had to stay here so if you can please make some arrangements for their stay
[28:46] they will leave after resting for a while
[28:48] Yes dear why not, after all guests are God's blessings
[28:52] let me do the arrangements right away
[28:55] Come, let me help you
[28:57] Tell me if you need to take out something
[29:16] Actually I have to go to Hasanabad in the morning
[29:22] so...
[29:25] will you come along?
[29:30] tomorrow the teachers are coming from the city, I have an important meeting with them
[29:40] Yes...
[29:43] its important though
[29:52] its alright
[30:35] We have enjoyed a lot, we will miss you a lot
[30:39] Here you go dear, this is a gift from our side
[30:42] what was the need for this formality, aunty? 
[30:45] Your love & hospitality was more than enough for us
[30:48] and I am not a guest, but your daughter. I will always keep visiting
[30:52] why not dear? Its your own village, your own house. You can visit whenever you want to
[31:00] We would have liked it a lot if you would have come along today with us
[31:04] God willing, we'll keep seeing each other now
[31:07] give it to me
[31:09] thank you!
[31:11] thanks for everyone's hospitality
its alright
[31:14] Sure...
God willing... 
[31:16] Good bye!
bye dear, take care
[33:19] I am very thankful to my teachers team who went abroad on our college's behalf to represent us
[33:29] and they came back with an extra degree by getting a distinction
[33:39] with a passion that they'll spread this light of education in the children of their country
[33:47] Such people are the pride of our nation. I congratulate them
[33:57] Now let me invite Mr. Khursheed to come & talk heart to heart with his dear students
[34:06] Please...
[34:12] Greetings! first of all I am very thankful to you all. To my students...
[34:18] and to my colleagues who took out some time from their precious time & came here for us
[34:23] I don't have a lot to say, but I would like to pass on my experiences & learning to you all
[34:35] So that together we can progress as a nation, education wise
[35:26] Autograph please...
[35:57] you've written such a nice poetry
[36:00] for whom you've written?
[36:04] for uncle
[36:08] What?
[36:09] really?
[36:11] Yes, what were you thinking?
[36:16] that you are such a big liar!
[36:22] Really?
yes
[36:24] hmm... as if you speak so much of truth
[36:30] if I had the treasure of words like you have Khursheed, then I would have said it almost hundred of times
[36:41] What?
[36:42] that Rutba Mehr Ali Khan I love you a lot, but no
[36:52] although its such a simple dissuasion of a few words
[36:59] I do love you
[37:08] you couldn't say such a small thing?
[37:14] actually...
[37:17] I would have died, if you had refused
[37:24] So, you would have spent your life peacefully by not expressing it to me?
[37:32] Rutba, I have spent my entire life while fighting with my heart
[37:38] So, I will spend the rest of my life while fighting with you
[37:41] Oho...
Okay?
[37:43] absolutely correct!
[37:44] As is it, now whether you fight with your heart or with me. Its the same thing
[37:50] After all, the other name of your heart is Rutba
[37:56] it seems as if you have read all of my books
[37:59] hmm... not all, but some of them
[38:04] But so many... Now tell me, what will you read?
[38:12] Your eyes...
[38:16] Your face...
[38:29] in the name of your love...
[38:34] Life is a collection of moments, but in its own unique way, 
[38:39] everyone says we get entangled... 
[38:45] Life is kind to me, unlike other way, 
[38:49] and this dawn belongs to me the other way.
[38:54] If I become the world for you, so what? 
[38:59] In me, there's a whole universe of living for another way.
