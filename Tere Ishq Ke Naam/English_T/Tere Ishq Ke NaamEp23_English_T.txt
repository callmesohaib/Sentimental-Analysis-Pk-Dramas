[00:14] and education will be your weapon 
[00:17] nobody will be able to defeat you
[00:22] because a life's battle cannot be won by wealth, properties or money
it is won by education & thinking
[00:35] uncle, I had passed every difficulty in my life because of your such words
[00:47] what else shall I tell you about Altamash?
[00:50] He loves me so much. Honestly speaking sometimes I get fed up
[00:56] now tell me, to get ready for him on daily basis. To get dolled up
[01:03] to go out with him on the dinner
[01:05] he buys flowers for me, and make me wear them with his own hands
[01:12] and...
[01:13] and?
[01:16] say it
[01:20] why have you stopped?
[01:22] tell us, what else does he do for you?
[01:26] he says that he was in love with me since childhood
[01:30] he always wanted to add me in his life
[01:35] actually its was his parents contumacy to make you their daughter-in-law
[01:42] and that too just for the sake of the greed for uncle's wealth
[01:47] otherwise, there wasn't any other reason
[01:52] I can understand
[01:56] anyways, leave it. Mom says that we shouldn't tell all these things to everyone. As evil can affect
[02:05] Azka, can we discuss something else?
[02:09] all three of us have met after so long
[02:13] but you are just telling us the love stories of brother Altamash & yours
[02:17] stop your rubbish! My tongue won't act upon your command
[02:20] I say whatever is there in my heart
[02:23] Besides, all of this happens between friends. Right Rutba?
[02:29] you tell me, how is your life with Khursheed aka Sheeda?
[02:36] by the way, so far from the countryside and in a small city
[02:43] and a small house in it
[02:48] I feel so bad for you
[02:53] my life is good
[02:59] however... money, wealth, properties...
[03:06] there isn't any such thing in our life
[03:10] but still...
[03:15] now I have got to know
[03:20] that whether a person's name is Khursheed or Altamash
[03:25] it doesn't make any difference
[03:28] the difference is made by respect & insult
[03:34] the matter of difference is how much he respects his wife
[03:41] a worthless man is a person who raises his hand on his wife
[03:49] and compels her to leave the house by slapping her
[04:21] who had told you about the slap?
[04:24] who is telling you this rubbish?
[04:26] maybe Altamash did
[04:36] hey! what happened?
[04:39] you have mind it
[04:42] what's there to be angry about?
[04:45] I was just talking generally
[04:49] how come you are concerned with this slap related matter?
[05:39] take this Ronaq
[05:42] this is the cheque of 50 lac rupees
[05:46] Arfa's marriage gift
[05:49] I will attend the wedding if I will be fine otherwise
[05:54] my prayers are with Arfa
[05:57] yes, thank you brother
[06:00] but brother, don't you think that its injustice?
[06:06] I didn't get it, Ronaq?
[06:07] brother, all of this amount will be spent on the wedding expenses
[06:12] if Azka's wedding gift was Saeedpur's lands, so will you wed off Arfa empty hands?
[06:19] she also have some right
[06:26] mom
[06:29] there is no need for you to make uncle worry
[06:33] I don't need any money or so for my wedding
[06:36] and neither lands like Azka
[06:43] wealth is not the security for my happiness
[06:47] and God has blessed Hamdan with everything
[06:50] I won't face any problem or difficulty
[07:00] uncle
[07:03] from childhood till date, how many times quietly & without signifying any favor
[07:10] you have fulfilled our wishes & needs
[07:15] you had never made us realize that we don't have a father
[07:19] you have always taken good care of us
[07:24] now whatever you have is of Rutba's
[07:28] We have already taken so much of our share
[07:33] stay blessed dear
[07:36] but still I want you to keep this amount
[07:41] thank you so much, uncle
[09:29] Khursheed
[10:16] Greetings!
[10:19] greetings! how are you?
[10:23] I am absolutely fine. You tell me, is everything fine? How is your uncle now?
[10:30] thanks to God, everything is fine
[10:33] and Rutba?
[10:36] She is also fine, she is at her father's house
[10:40] is there any special reason that Rutba didn't came along with you
[10:47] Ms. Tazmeen, when the differences between two people become so much that neither they can see the face of each other or could hear the voice of each other then
[10:57] living together become painful
[11:02] that's why I didn't ask her to come along, and she also find it appropriate to stay there
[11:07] but Mr. Khursheed...
what have you decided about UK?
[11:13] its my good luck that the university has selected me
[11:18] it takes a lot of time for the documentation, and I think we should start the preparation quickly
[11:24] yes, I will be needing your help
[11:28] Absolutely!
[11:31] shall I make tea for you? Would you like to drink?
[11:33] Sure
[12:04] oho...
[12:07] you have started to serve your father
[12:10] my daughter has become so big
[12:28] see, I drank all the milk on your one command
[12:35] do you remember, when you were small
[12:38] I used to spend an hour to make you drink this one glass of milk
[12:43] and you never used to listen to me
[12:44] I do remember
[12:47] I remember everything
[12:50] my stupidities, my mistakes...
[12:55] your paramountcy & your generosity...
[13:00] everything...
[13:08] dad
[13:13] dad, why you have transferred Saeedpur's land on Azka's name? She doesn't deserve it
[13:21] how did you get to know?
[13:23] dad
[13:28] your daughter's happiness was not like a shining star on the sky, for which you had to do so much
[13:36] dear, for a father her daughter's happiness is way too precious than the shining stars on the sky
[13:44] now you must have understood that for Mehr Ali, the piece of land, the fragrance of money, and the long bank statements doesn't have any meaning
[13:57] Saeedpur's land is still on the same place as it was earlier
[14:01] farm, barleymow, paths, tube well, animals fleet... all are still there
[14:08] if something has changed then on the documents instead of Mehr Ali Khan's name, Azka & Altamash's name has been printed
[14:16] and... the amount that we used to get from those lands annually in my bank account. Now goes into their bank account
[14:26] what's the harm in it?
[14:28] my daughter's life has been improved, what else do I need?
[14:34] yesterday that land was of someone else, then it became mine. Now its of someone else's and in the future it will be of someone else
[14:42] So, what's the big deal
[14:45] why are you taking such a small matter to your heart?
[14:51] dad, the matter is not about lands or wealth
[14:56] my father's blood & sweat isn't so cheap that it shall be used to clean the bad intentions of others
[15:04] dear, your father is a very fortunate man
[15:10] God has tested him with wealth
[15:14] but thanks to God that he succeeded
[15:19] the love for wealth is such a strong thing
[15:22] it doesn't die by any means
[15:25] shall I give you its example?
[15:29] now Altamash is not stopping on only Saeedpur's land
[15:34] in fact, in order to keep Azka happily married with him. He also took away Sheikhupura factories from me
[15:44] dad!
[15:49] yes dear
[15:51] so what? it doesn't make any difference to me
[15:55] I have chosen Khursheed's companionship for you
[15:59] which is most precious in this world
[16:17] stay blessed dear
[16:19] stay happy
[16:24] I want to know by any means that how come Rutba got to know that Altamash has raised his hand on me
[16:29] he had insulted me & I had to leave the house
[16:31] you tell me aunty? What was my respect left over there?
[16:35] yes yes, we'll get to know. Just sit down, relax & drink water
[16:39] you look like Ronaq whenever you are angry
[16:42] my mother has also spent her entire life in injustices
[16:46] I don't want to spend a life like hers at all
[16:52] I know it very well how to take my right
[16:56] tell me, you have been meeting Rutba right?
[16:59] today, it was quite clear from your attitude that there is something fishy
[17:05] you are making a mountain out of a molehill uselessly
[17:10] Rutba is my cousin
[17:14] I haven't met her
[17:17] but I can meet her, and there is no harm in it
[17:21] your objection is useless
[17:24] what!
[17:27] aunty, are you listening?
[17:28] he shall meet Rutba & I shouldn't even object?
[17:33] you guys are exaggerating the matter for no reason
[17:36] Rutba is married now & she is happy with Khursheed. Didn't you hear what she was saying?
[17:42] and Azka look, when a married woman wants to keep her family intact then she compromises with a lot of matters
[17:52] So aunty, you also listen to me very carefully
[17:55] I really don't know how to do a compromise
[17:59] I haven't come here to spend my life patiently & happily by quietly doing a compromise with these walls & doors
[18:08] I came here as Altamash's wife, and he has to stay only mine
[18:13] as far as Rutba is concerned, he cannot look at her at all. Otherwise...
[18:22] Otherwise?
[18:25] yes?
[18:27] Otherwise?
[18:32] you are about to become a father
[18:39] if you won't stay only mine
[18:42] then I will kill myself, as well as the baby
[19:30] dad, you should have taken the doctor's suggestion before doing such a long journey
[19:38] dear, few journeys are as such in which no suggestions have any importance
[19:46] what will the doctors say?
[19:49] dear, a journey is done on a heart's voice
[19:52] and the doctors gives prescription against the same heart
[19:56] does the heart beat has ever functioned on a doctor's advice?
[20:01] Okay, then I will also go along with you
[20:06] dear, I have to see the land related matters
[20:08] and the entire day the lawyers & distributors will be visiting me
[20:12] you take care of the matters over here. God willing, I will be back within two days. Ok?
[20:39] this heart wants only one thing
[20:43] there is only one desire of this heart
[20:46] Rutba... Rutba, Rutba...
[20:57] you don't need to say anything
[21:00] your eyes...
[21:04] your eyes says everything
[21:14] how is everyone at home?
[21:17] and how is your work going?
[21:20] Arfa
[21:22] I will call you later, bye!
[21:30] the discussion was happening between me & brother Mehr Ali
[21:34] So, why you came there? And with whose permission you have said such a big thing to him?
[21:39] I was talking about your benefit. Do you know what big loss you have faced?
[21:44] mom...
[21:47] you have been doing efforts for your entire life for such benefits
[21:51] what did you got?
[21:53] our father wasn't as rich as uncle
[21:57] neither he was such a big feudal landlord
[22:00] but at least he had left enough for us that we can life our life proudly
[22:06] but you haven't taught us how to live a respectful life
[22:10] as if we used to live like beggars
[22:12] and that kind of beggar, which snatches away the charity if he doesn't get it easily
[22:16] stay in your limits!
[22:20] let me speak today!
[22:23] let me lessen the burden of my heart today
[22:26] you don't know, how difficult it is to spend your entire life in this lie
[22:33] and I had spent my entire life in this house
[22:36] I saw two faces of yours
[22:39] then whether its uncle Mehr Ali or aunt Sanober
[22:42] you kept meeting them with a smiling face, while keeping malice & grudge in your heart
[22:48] you have always been an enemy from the back, & friends from the front
[22:53] such kind of parents attitude makes children go blind
[22:56] then they are not left capable enough to look at the world in the right manner
[23:01] and this has happened with Azka
[23:05] how come so much of hatred & anger got into her
[23:11] have you ever thought?
[23:14] if you don't get it then snatch it
[23:16] because of this rule she has snatched away Altamash from Rutba
[23:21] but what Azka got?
[23:24] even today, Altamash is still Rubta's
[23:27] and Azka.. she is licking her own wounds
[23:31] ok enough! enough of your rubbish
[23:35] don't utter a single word! I would have slapped you if you weren't getting married
[23:40] if you don't like the face, then you feel like breaking the mirror
[23:47] but one should think, that whose fault is it
[23:52] is it of the mirror, or of the face
[23:56] I am leaving
[23:58] that's why for the first & last time I have gathered the courage to say such bitter things
[24:07] you are my mother
[24:10] I didn't wanted to hurt you
[24:14] but whenever I see around myself, I don't see anything except for the scorching heat of the sun
[24:21] and then, I understand the meaning of shadow & shelter
[24:28] Mehr Ali uncle
[24:33] who had always been a thick shadow for us
[24:39] I swear upon God mom
[24:42] after seeing him, I understood
[24:45] the real meaning of respect & honor
[25:31] after the completion of documentation, I will go to my brother's house to Islamabad for a few days
[25:39] I will leave to fulfill my dreams, after meeting my brother & sister-in-law once
[25:47] Khursheed Hasan, do you know I am very happy
[25:50] really!
[25:51] nowadays, I feel that I don't have any complain or objection with life
[25:59] to teach & to study, it was always my dream
[26:03] To see my dreams getting fulfilled so beautifully
[26:08] now I got to know that its such a good feeling
[26:13] absolutely correct!
[26:17] this is the only passion that doesn't let a person stop or get tired
[26:23] every new flight gives new power to a person's wings
[26:28] I am thinking to apply for PhD
[26:32] yes, I know that you will do it for sure
[26:37] So what do you think? Shall I call you doctor Khursheed Hasan?
[26:43] No, no there isn't any such thing
[26:46] it doesn't make any difference by adding an extra word in your name
[26:51] the question still remains the same that what have you given to this world?
[26:56] now whether I would be able to give something or not. But I would like to lit my share of lamp for sure
[27:06] Can I say something to you, if you don't mind?
[27:12] the way you have asked this question, for sure it must be related to Rutba
[27:18] See, if she agrees to go to the UK along with you. Then you should take her along with you
[27:27] Look, sometimes when you are unable to see the face of your loved ones clearly. Also you are unable to hear their voice clearly
[27:35] then you should never close the door of your heart
[27:38] one should try to clear the fog of presumption
[27:48] kindly drop me to my friend's apartment while coming back from the embassy
[27:55] Okay
[27:58] and... if you meet Rutba then do ask her that what does she want
[28:19] Altamash
[28:22] you are here
[28:24] but dad has gone to the farm house
[28:28] I know, that's why I came
[28:35] did you come to meet me?
[28:39] this heart wants only one thing
[28:43] there is only one desire of this heart
[28:47] Rutba... Rutba, Rutba...
[28:57] you don't need to say anything
[29:01] your eyes...
[29:05] your eyes says everything
[29:08] you have taught these eyes how to speak
[29:11] your beautiful face did
[29:15] your eyes did
[29:17] otherwise, these eyes are completely dumb for others
[29:21] true...
[29:25] I swear upon your life
[29:32] Khursheed you!
[29:36] what happened?
[29:38] don't worry so much Rutba, I won't say anything
[29:45] after seeing all this, I am left with no courage to say anything
[29:51] Khursheed, listen to me...
[29:52] Quiet!
[29:56] be quiet!
[29:59] otherwise I will shed your dirty blood on this clean floor
[30:05] how dare you!
please please..
[30:08] Altamash, please go
[30:11] please Altamash, go from here
[30:18] I will see you later
[30:28] Khursheed...
[30:29] what? What Khursheed?
[30:33] what more do you want? Do you want freedom?
[30:35] let me give it right away, I have no problem. I have to do a sign only
please no...
[30:39] Please
[30:42] don't even think of it
[30:48] my father will die.. please no
[30:55] please
[30:58] Rutba
[31:01] I wish you could have thought like this for someone else as well
[31:11] I want to say a lot, but now I am left with no more courage
[31:17] right now I can only say one thing to you
[31:26] bye!
[33:17] I am so happy since I have heard this good news
[33:26] its not an easy task to produce an offspring in Bazil Khan's family
[33:31] don't know what not I did to get pregnant, whether its religious affair or wordily
[33:41] Thanks God, this is the second good news this house will be experiencing after so many years
[33:48] now take very good care of yourself & of Altamash's baby
[33:53] you should be saying this to Altamash, right aunty?
[33:57] because he has to take care of me
[34:00] but he doesn't even look at me properly
[34:03] what am I wearing & of what color, where am I going. He doesn't see anything
[34:09] did you see, how he was looking at Rutba on that day?
[34:12] like a crazy person
[34:14] I felt like taking out Altamash's eyes or scratching Rutba's face
[34:21] I had gone there to make Rutba jealous, And to make fund of her helplessness
[34:25] but I am getting jealous since I came back
[34:30] what enmity you have with Rutba?
[34:33] and why are you adamant in making her feel jealous?
[34:37] there are a lot of favors of brother Mehr Ali
[34:40] on you and on your mother as well
[34:46] the age in which you had become an orphan, at that time you didn't even knew the meaning of an orphan
[34:50] neither brother Mehr Ali made you realized it
[34:53] he had always given priority to Rutba on us
[34:56] and if he gave us anything ever, then it was in charity
[35:00] you have Ronaq's tongue in your mouth
[35:03] She also used to pull the hair of the person next to her, whenever she used to fall in her childhood
[35:09] by claiming that the person next to her had pushed her
[35:13] and listen to me very carefully
[35:16] next time, always refrain to use such words for Altamash
[35:21] because he will ensure to feed the meat of that person to the animals, who talks such things about him
[35:31] you don't know Altamash yet
[36:42] greetings uncle!
[36:44] greetings dear! stay blessed. When is your flight?
[36:48] my flight is day after tomorrow night, right now I am going to the village to meet mom
[36:54] tonight I will stay with her
[36:57] it means, I have to bid you farewell on the phone
[37:03] its important for me to stay here for a few more days
[37:07] I have kept the basis of college, so I have to make its arrangements
[37:12] dear, the poor & needy kids of this area needed the college since long time
[37:20] oh wow uncle! you have given me such a good news
[37:25] you are like that person among those people who spreads darkness & hopelessness
[37:31] the way a lamp is lit up in a dark night
[37:35] dear, life is the name of a concise journey
[37:40] its the desire of every extinguishing lamp to lit up thousands of new lamps
[37:48] did you meet Rutba?
[37:50] you should have taken her to the village with you, she would have met Rasheeda
[37:56] uncle, every person has their own list of liking to meet people
[38:00] I had gone to meet Rutba
[38:03] She is very happy in Mehr Ali house
[38:05] dear, Rutba's position in Mehr Ali house is just like a guest
[38:12] She is your responsibility, always remember that
[38:21] with whom you are going to the village?
[38:26] for now I am going alone
[38:29] Okay dear
[38:32] may God keep you in his protection. Stay happy
[38:38] Bye, uncle!
[38:40] Bye dear!
