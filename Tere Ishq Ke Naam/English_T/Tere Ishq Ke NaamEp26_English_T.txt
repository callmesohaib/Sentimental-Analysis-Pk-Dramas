[00:14] no dad
[00:17] you won
[00:24] to fulfill your ugly relations beautifully is the biggest achievement of a person
[00:31] and you did this in such a pretty manner
[00:39] I do feel the pain of my mother's demise
[00:45] but you gave me that love as well that you had with her
[00:51] I don't have any complain with you
[01:01] Azka, I heard you are not well 
[01:05] are you fine? You seem unwell. What happened? 
[01:08] Altamash's companionship didn't suited you?
[01:11] who told you that I am not well? 
[01:14] Altamash told me...
[01:19] do you and Altamash talk? do you guys meet as well?
[01:24] what's with you? Why are you over reacting a lot?
[01:28] oh! I think you are forgetting that now I am not Rutba Mehr Ali, but Rutba Khursheed Hasan
[01:36] and Altamash is my cousin, I can meet him & talk to him
[01:41] right aunty? Is there any restriction?
[01:43] no my dear...
[01:44] Rutba
[01:48] I can't believe you are here in this house, standing in front of me
[01:55] then believe it
[01:57] that I am standing here in front of you
[02:06] I was going to the university, so I thought to meet you all on my way
[02:10] dad always say...
[02:12] that a person who doesn't have relations, is like a tree without branches & leaves
[02:18] and no matter how tall it becomes
[02:22] still it doesn't gives fruit, it stays unfruitful
[02:27] So I thought, I shall try to mend my relations too
[02:31] Stay happy & blessed. I feel so happy to see you here
[02:36] do keep visiting us, Ok?
[02:38] Sure aunty, why not
[02:42] I shall leave now, Altamash
[02:45] take care of Azka
[02:50] after all she did so much for you
[02:57] so now its your duty
[03:00] I am fulfilling my duty though
[03:15] I am leaving
[03:17] Rutba, let me see you off
[03:25] yes Altamash, go drop her
[03:27] Good bye!
[03:28] Bye dear...
[04:48] its so difficult to tolerate you
[04:51] still I am doing it
[04:53] no problem, one needs to tolerate
[04:56] somebody needs to tolerate more, and somebody needs to tolerate less
[04:59] its your class time
[05:52] I believe it too now
[05:55] there is something fishy going on
[05:58] I will turn the entire matter upside down
[06:01] that Rutba flirts with my Altamash, and that too in front of me
[06:06] I will thrash her so hard that she won't be able to show her face to anyone ever
[06:09] Ok
[06:11] Azka look, I cannot sit here with you at all times. I have to go back to my house as well
[06:16] I have another daughter too Arfa. I have to see her, also I have to throw a dinner party for her & to bid farewell to her
[06:21] don't know when she'll come to see us
[06:22] Please tell her not to come back. Stay there & there is no need to fill my life with poison after coming here
[06:27] how are you talking?
[06:30] change yourself!
[06:34] you have to change yourself, otherwise you cannot spend your life like this
[06:37] one needs to bend down their head at hundreds of places, also have to stay quiet so many times
[06:41] if you'll fight with everyone, then you'll be left all alone in this world
[06:50] we'll do something
[06:52] we have to do something as such that, we shall be succeed without any loss
[06:57] something as such shall be done with Rutba, which is more worse than what I am thinking
[07:04] mom
[07:07] I have to talk to Khursheed
[07:09] get me his number
[07:12] we'll get Khursheed's number, I'll get it somehow
[07:17] but whatever we do this time, we have to do it after thinking a lot about it
[07:22] look at sister Sanober
[07:24] how cleverly she has played all of her cards
[07:28] she has become good in front of brother as well, also she has mend all her relations with Rutba too
[07:35] we have to do the same thing, And we'll do it
[07:39] we'll be succeed without facing any loss
[07:43] don't you worry at all
[07:45] I've understood everything
[07:48] Okay, I am leaving now
[08:09] ask the catering people to decorate the entire lawn very nicely
[08:14] do it quickly
[08:17] Greetings dad!
[08:18] Greetings dear!
[08:20] why all these preparations?
[08:23] its my daughter's birthday. Whether she remembers it or not But I do
[08:27] dad, I've grown up now. Will you still celebrate my birthday like this by decorating he house?
[08:33] why not?
[08:35] dear, the environment shall be lively whenever the heart is happy
[08:39] the life becomes beautiful all of sudden
[08:42] dear Rutba, your birthday is the most beautiful moment of my life
[08:48] such moments should be celebrated especially
[08:51] I love you! I love you so much, dad
[08:54] love you dear... 
[08:55] there is no comparison of this sentence, no matter whatever I do for you Rutba
[09:00] ok tell me whom shall we invite?
[09:04] do one thing, invite all of your university friends
[09:06] I don't have much friends
[09:09] besides, the group has also been changed now
[09:13] I think, we should invite aunt Ronaq & aunt Sanober's families
[09:19] are you still comfortable with them?
[09:23] why not dad? I am your daughter
[09:28] I know the skills of living with a smile on my face while hiding the wrong doings by good nature
[09:36] don't take any sort of tension
[09:39] leave all the invitations on me
[09:48] let me go & get freshen
[10:12] yes brother... 
[10:15] its such a good news, heartiest congratulations to you 
[10:19] yes.. how is this possible that you invite us & we don't come
[10:23] We'll come for sure, God willing
[10:25] yes... Bye!
[10:32] Okay... so uncle is celebrating the birthday of his dearest daughter
[10:36] he wants to show us that everything is fine
[10:39] but maybe uncle doesn't know that his dearest daughter is still trying to find the spark in her lost long love
[10:47] sister & Altamash will go there for sure
[10:50] Azka, you have to keep a control on Altamash as well as on yourself too
[10:54] what if you burn your hands from the sparks coming out of Rutba's game of fire
[11:03] mom, I don't find Altamash's intentions right
[11:07] he has completely changed since he got the land's documents
[11:12] he was saying to me that if you had to go for a routine check up then go with my mother
[11:16] its not important for me to accompany you
[11:18] now tell me, even in this condition his support is not important for me
[11:23] but he will go on Rutba's birthday for sure
[11:26] I am desperately waiting for you to give birth to this baby
[11:30] you'll see, he'll become the chains of Altamash's feet
[11:35] mom, I just want a son by any means
[11:38] let me give birth to a son once, then I will fix Altamash
[11:44] he will be the heir of his everything
[11:47] God willing, you will give birth to a son. You'll see
[11:51] then you'll govern on that house completely
[11:54] but remember Azka
[11:56] Keep a control on yourself. Don't come into Rutba's any trap
[12:05] I had asked you for Khursheed's number
[12:08] yes... here it is
[12:10] send it to yourself
[12:45] today is Rutba's birthday, right?
[12:50] did you wish her?
[12:53] you are quite a dark horse
[12:57] I say everything... but you are the one who is a dark horse
[13:03] yes but... you don't know how to hide your emotions
[13:08] your quietness & sadness since morning was telling me that today is some special day
[13:14] I just focused on it a bit, and I understood
[13:19] the words from which I was saving myself for an entire day, you have said those words
[13:25] I don't want to miss her
[13:28] and she doesn't leaves your mind
[13:35] do you know what Rutba had said to me in our last meeting?
[13:40] She didn't said that we should end the misunderstandings prevailing between us
[13:44] or she will wait for me, or my departure will make any difference to her
[13:49] instead she had said that I should get married to Ms. Tazmeen, because we are made for each other
[14:00] If that was your last meeting
[14:05] then did you tell her that she shall wait for you to come back
[14:10] or had you said that you don't have a space in your life for another woman except for Rutba
[14:17] why shall I say this?
[14:18] because you love her
[14:19] but I also respect my emotions
[14:23] I cannot ruin them in the dust of those who don't value them
[14:48] you shall talk.. I have to go to the library
[15:04] greetings uncle!
[15:05] greetings! Khursheed, don't call me uncle
[15:09] do call me dad
[15:12] Okay, fine..
[15:14] how are you, dad?
[15:16] see, how am I looking?
[15:17] dignified as always
[15:20] see, how is the house looking?
[15:25] its looking so beautiful, is there any party in the house?
[15:29] yes Khursheed, I want to light up my house like this on the daily basis
[15:34] that's why I keep counting days daily for your return
[15:38] upon your return, your welcome will be way too grand than this
[15:43] presently, we are celebrating Rutba's birthday
[15:49] heartiest congratulations to you
[15:52] why are you congratulating me? Congratulate the one whose birthday it is
[15:56] look over there, here she comes
[16:10] here, talk to her
[16:19] happy birthday to you, Rutba
[16:24] Thank you!
[16:28] you seem so happy
[16:30] I feel good to see you
[16:35] I also want to see you happy
[16:39] you haven't realized it as of yet?
[16:54] how is Tazmeen?
[17:00] she isn't like that as you think about her
[17:04] yes
[17:06] Mostly I do mistake in understanding people
[17:13] I don't have that much wisdom as you have
[17:17] but you..
[17:20] you understand everything
[17:22] why do you taunt me?
[17:25] I have nothing
[17:28] neither good looks, nor intelligence, nor wealth or properties
[17:33] I only have some self-respect & honor, due to which I am living my life
[17:39] let me live...
[17:43] I always pray for your long & healthy life
[17:47] for your happiness
[17:53] live your favorite life
[17:57] with your favorite people
[18:01] think before praying for me
[18:03] what if it becomes a curse for you
[18:09] I had decided after giving it a lot of thought
[18:11] do you doubt?
If you say so, the shall I write it down?
[18:16] there is no need of it
[18:19] Bye!
[18:25] Bye!
[19:36] Greetings!*
[19:39] happy birthday dear
Thank you so much!
[19:42] Altamash
[19:45] I need your help, can you please come with me?
[20:35] come here
Azka...
[20:37] let me go!
what's with you? Come here, Azka!
[20:40] what's with you?
[20:42] there is no need to become emotional & don't create a scene. Everyone is looking
[20:47] Ok
[20:48] whatever you'll do now will get reversed on you
[20:51] Altamash has gone blind in her love
[20:57] Greetings brother...
[20:58] Greetings! Stay blessed
[21:00] heartiest congratulations to you
[21:02] brother, I always pray that your house shall always stay filled with such happiness
[21:07] thank you, Ronaq
[21:08] yes, and now our happiness is no longer separate. Its associated with each other
[21:14] Besides, there can never be misunderstandings in the relations of siblings
[21:18] this relation is like a flowing water
[21:21] here some time gets passed, and there everything becomes so pure & clean once again. Right brother?
[21:30] you have said the right thing Sanober
I can't see Rutba anywhere, where has she gone?
[21:36] She...
actually, she can't see anyone else except Altamash
[21:44] that's why she took him along
[21:48] Azka, what do you do? Didn't you hear? She had some important work with Altamash
[21:54] Besides, he is her cousin not an enemy
[22:21] Transfer Saeedpur lands & Sheikhupura factories in my name
[22:30] also your mansion too
[22:36] I do have a right to test you this much
[22:49] these are the papers of Sheikhupura factories
[22:53] why dad has transferred them on your name, Altamash?
[22:57] uncle had gifted them to me & Azka as a wedding gift
[23:01] Saeedpur's lands are Azka's gift
[23:06] Sheikhupura's factories is my gift
[23:09] but see...
[23:11] these papers are with uncle & I don't have any issue
[23:16] because I don't love lands, properties or wealth. I only love Rutba Mehr Ali
[23:28] I need to try that
[24:15] uncle is searching for you outside
[24:18] they are waiting for the cake cutting ceremony
[24:21] but... don't know what secret things you are telling Altamash in privacy
[24:33] can I ask what as such the discussion was?
[24:38] are you doubting me?
[24:41] however, when Altamash was my fiance
[24:46] I had never doubted you
[24:51] not only you... but she had never let me doubt on her as well
[24:59] he had played the game of love in such a great manner that I thought its my victory
[25:06] until death
[25:13] come on, you have already defeated Rutba Mehr Ali Khan
[25:19] so why are you being scared of the defeated people now?
[25:26] Come, lets cut the cake together
[25:29] and then we'll eat it together
[25:31] shall we go?
[25:53] greetings uncle!
[25:56] greetings!
[26:07] dad, you know that now I am not an eighteen year old inexperienced Rutba anymore
[26:18] I know, I haven't read a lot of books like Khursheed did
[26:24] but I know how to read your face
[26:28] I'm grown up now, please...
[26:32] please stop worrying about me
[26:34] come, lets cut the cake
[27:55] won't you feed me?
[28:36] do you see, whatever is happening?
[28:41] its you who is watching Bazil, I am understanding everything
[28:49] he fire has lit up again
[28:52] have you ever thought about its consequences?
[28:55] the consequences will be good
[29:08] you are doing so much of politics, sister
[29:11] you can change my name from Ronaq if I didn't made you fall on your face
[29:14] now you'll see, how many birds I will kill from one arrow
[29:20] lets go Azka
[29:22] lets go please
[29:28] Mostly I do mistake in understanding people
[29:35] I don't have that much wisdom as you have
[29:39] but you..
[29:42] you understand everything
[29:49] I always pray for your long & healthy life
[29:53] for your happiness
[29:57] live your favorite life
[30:01] with your favorite people
[30:12] its very cold today, so coffee was necessary
[30:18] do you know the identity of a good friend?
[30:21] yes... he listens to the condition of your heart without even saying
[30:26] this is the benefit of being friends with an intelligent girl
[30:29] She says everything, and you don't need to say anything
[30:35] Also, you can share your heart's matter with her without any hesitation
[30:40] apparently you are happy, upset or missing someone special
[30:48] who will decide whether the person who wants to get separated is our loved one or not
[30:54] even this beautiful evening & raindrops aren't able to answer this question
[30:59] then how can I decide in this delusion that whether I am missing someone or trying to forget that person?
[31:08] Khursheed
[31:11] there has been a very big communication gap in between you two
[31:16] both of you are increasing these distances instead of reducing them because of your ego & stubbornness
[31:26] maybe you are unable to understand, but I have understood
[31:33] you are not that Khursheed Hasan whom I had met in Hasanabad
[31:43] that Khursheed was also in love with Rutba
[31:47] but his love hadn't captivated his soul like any trap
[31:54] it was like a bright light in the heart
[32:02] and Khursheed used to laugh
[32:05] sleep & dream on his own
[32:10] but...
[32:12] Rutba's little companionship has lost that Khursheed Hasan somewhere
[32:24] now this Khursheed Hasan who is in front of me
[32:29] he has got himself distributed in a lot of portions of love, separation, & agony
[32:38] the lamp that was lit within the heart
[32:41] has become a fire, which is burning the entire body
[32:46] this Khursheed Hasan neither sleeps on his own
[32:51] neither he sees his favorite dreams
[32:55] neither he laughs, nor he lives his life
[32:59] until when this will go on?
[33:01] since you have fallen in love then why don't you express it?
[33:05] since you had married, then why don't you signify your right?
[33:09] your competition of ego & stubbornness with a weak & pretty girl doesn't suits you
[33:17] the Khursheed Hasan I know is quite strong & respectable
[33:24] what should I do then?
[33:27] should I bend down?
[33:30] or shall I beg for my love & loyalty?
[33:35] I shall think that she is in love with me, if she smiles & looks at me
[33:40] and if she ignores me then I shall think that she is habitual of this game
[33:44] at least ask her once by considering her your life partner, & your loyal friend from the bottom of your heart
[33:51] Rutba, do you love me or not
[33:55] do you need my companionship or not?
[33:59] do you want me to come back or not?
[34:02] then see what answer Rutba gives
[34:07] if she said "yes" then I will reach to my lost paradise
[34:13] but if she said "no" then...
[34:17] I will fall in the hell of humiliation for life time
[34:21] just think...
[34:24] she must be standing on the same verge as well
[34:27] and must be waiting for you
[36:17] yes Altamash, tell me
[36:20] is everything alright? since you have called me all of a sudden
[36:24] I hope you haven't fought with Azka
[36:27] we fight with the people of our equal level
[36:30] what will I do by fighting with that poor girl?
[36:32] its wrong, Altamash
[36:35] she is your wife
[36:37] your honor..
[36:40] it doesn't suits you to talk such things about her
[36:44] she is less of a wife but more of a conspiratorial person
[36:46] anyways let it be, presently she has gone to her mother's house
[36:50] her blood pressure got high while coming back from the birthday party
[36:54] the doctor has advised for a complete mental rest
[36:57] I am amazed
[36:59] although she has you by her side, but still she doesn't have complete mental peace
[37:06] even I don't have peace, that's why I am calling you Rutba
[37:12] I get peace when I see you, I get peace when I talk to you
[37:15] I get peace when I meet you
[37:18] Tell me, what's the cure of it?
[37:21] I cannot live like this
[37:24] how can I help you, Altamash?
[37:29] take divorce from Khursheed
[37:34] he is not capable enough to share his name with you
[37:40] even today, the doors of my house & heart are open for you
[37:44] and they will always remain open
[37:46] really!
[37:48] what about Azka?
[37:51] whom you got against the properties of Saeedpur?
[37:57] you will make the decision of Azka's future
[38:01] if you'll ask me then I will divorce her
[38:03] if you want, I will keep her in my house
[38:12] whatever you say
[38:14] you are quite even-minded
[38:19] but why will I ruin Azka's life?
[38:23] that poor girl has put her everything on the stake in order to get you
[38:29] you are her last benefit
[38:33] as far as getting separated from Khursheed Hasan is concerned
[38:37] that's not possible!
[38:45] Rutba, I will do whatever you'll say
[38:48] believe me
[38:51] I am ready to sacrifice everything for you
[38:57] alright then
[39:00] Transfer Saeedpur lands & Sheikhupura factories in my name
[39:09] also your mansion too
[39:15] I do have a right to test you this much
[39:22] when you are able to gather this much courage
[39:26] then call me
[39:31] bye!
