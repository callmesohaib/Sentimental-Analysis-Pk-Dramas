[00:18] there is only one desire of this heart 
[00:22] Rutba... Rutba, Rutba...

[00:36]  your eyes...
[00:39] your eyes says everything 
[01:07] I got your call, all good?
[01:11] Mr. Khursheed, actually my brother's flight got canceled due to Islamabad's weather. So he won't be able to come now
[01:19] Oh...
[01:22] So, what's your plan now?
[01:26] then I will go back to Hasanabad, as I don't have any place here to stay
[01:34] I am going to my village to meet my mother, if you want you can come along
[01:39] with you? to the village?
[01:42] its your choice
[01:45] I really want to see your village
[01:48] then come along, my mother is also there. She will take very good care of you
[01:53] you will feel like your own home
[01:55] home?
[01:57] my home?
[02:00] it feels as if its been so long that I had felt that way
[02:08] Come on then, let me go to your village along with you
[02:11] when I will meet your mother, I will feel like meeting my own mother
[02:18] also, its been so long that I had hugged my mother
[02:21] lets go
[02:24] sit
[02:50] so mom, how did you find Ms. Tazmeen?
[02:54] she is very nice
[02:57] mom, actually Ms. Tazmeen also wanted to see the village. So I thought to bring her along
[03:02] this way she will meet you too, as I had already told her so much about you
[03:05] you did very well, dear
[03:08] this is our small house
[03:10] this is our reality & truth
[03:14] right dear?
[03:15] mom, you know how much I love my village
[03:18] yes
[03:20] you haven't brought Rutba with you?
[03:28] mom, I am so tired & hungry
[03:33] let me bring the dinner
[03:49] yes dad, I had gone to the university
[03:52] I had a word with the teacher, there is a small process & after that I will be able to continue my studies
[03:58] Rutba, time is such a weird thing
[04:01] same days, same nights... same food
[04:06] but still the person keeps changing
[04:09] it was your desire, dad
[04:12] now its my desire
[04:14] so why are you amazed?
[04:17] you have taught me how to walk by holding my finger
[04:21] I am learning how to walk step by step along with you
[04:25] time.. moments. No matter how same they are
[04:32] but a person keeps on experiencing change
[04:40] I've started to become Mehr Ali Khan from Rutba Mehr Ali
[04:45] do you know, my favorite place in the entire house is that one where you used to sit
[04:51] did you go to the village with Khursheed?
[04:54] you should have gone, Rutba
[04:56] help him in his busy schedule
[05:02] dad... 
[05:05] I am learning how to take care of the house
[05:08] and then my studies will also start, I will hardly get any time
[05:14] if Khursheed is busy, then I am also not idle
[05:19] as you feel happy
[05:23] but do go to the airport to see him off
[05:27] tell him, that you will be waiting restlessly for him to come back
[05:38] do you hear me?
[05:44] yes dad... yes
[05:48] for sure, I will go to see off Khursheed
[05:55] Bye dad
[06:44] Khursheed, what are you thinking?
[06:50] nothing mom
[06:53] I was thinking...
[06:57] to convert our village's primary school into a high school after coming back to Pakistan
[07:06] God willing
[07:09] sure
[07:13] brother Mehr had gone to the farm house. And since Rutba was alone in the house, so you should have brought her along
[07:22] Umm.... actually Tazmeen's brother & sister-in-law lives in Islamabad
[07:32] She also had to go there, but due to bad weather the flight got canceled
[07:37] and she couldn't go
[07:39] So I thought to bring her here so that she can meet you too
[07:43] I am talking about Rutba & you are talking about Tazmeen. After all, what is this matter Khursheed?
[08:01] Mom, I am the owner of this small house of this small village
[08:10] and she is the only heir of that big palace of the big city
[08:17] we are not compatible with each other
[08:23] I have accepted it
[08:26] and it would be better for you to accept it as soon as possible
[08:31] slowly & gradually, rest everyone will understand it too
[08:34] what are you trying to say?
[08:38] Ms. Tazmeen & I are going to the UK from our university for a course 
[08:44] it will take me a year & a half over there
[08:47] you know its my dream since childhood
[08:51] and... I cannot reject this dream of mine
[08:57] Besides... 
[09:00] this time will be easily passed with your prayers
[09:04] Khursheed, remember one thing
[09:09] Rutba is not only my daughter-in-law, but brother Mehr's favor
[09:17] that's why, never take this matter out of your mind Khursheed
[10:18] hello Arfa, how are you?
[10:20] I'm fine Rutba, and very happy
[10:24] All praise to God, always stay happy
[10:28] I have also told mom
[10:31] that I am very happy as I am leaving this house
[10:38] my existence has always been like the walls of this house
[10:44] I kept listening to everything quietly
[10:47] I kept tolerating everything which I shouldn't have
[10:56] you are coming in the evening, right?
[10:58] I am eagerly waiting for you to come, more than Azka
[11:01] hmm... I will come for sure
[11:06] I have always considered you as my younger sister
[11:10] its our henna ceremony, your happiness. So how is this possible that I will not come?
[11:15] and then, dad is also not here. So I have to come for him as well
[11:23] Okay, I will wait for you
[11:27] Bye
bye!
[11:42] oh mom, why are you crying? Its a matter of one year only
[11:47] it will pass very quickly & then I will come to you directly
[11:57] stay blessed dear, stay happy
[12:00] ok listen
[12:02] uncle must be alone in the city, so don't leave him alone. Keep visiting him
[12:06] is this something to say?
[12:09] why only brother Mehr? My daughter-in-law Rutba is also there. How can I stop going there?
[12:18] just take care of yourself
[12:31] I feel so satisfied after coming in this area
[12:36] Mr. Kursheed, childhood is like this friend
[12:39] whenever you meet him, you feel satisfied
[12:42] maybe you are right
[12:44] a person doesn't meet the ways, paths, & house. But he meets with its childhood's memories
[12:53] there is only one school in this village
[12:56] and the basis of that school was kept by my uncle
[13:00] oh wow!
Mehr Ali Khan
[13:04] God willing, when I'll come back to this village then I will convert the primary school of this village into a high school first & then to a college
[13:15] God wiling
[13:17] God willing
[13:19] anyways, how do you find my village?
[13:23] I felt that I will always stay happy even if I spend my entire life here
[14:42] All praise to God... 
[14:49] you are looking so pretty
[14:53] very simple & innocent
[15:00] do you know
[15:03] You always used to look like a doll when you were so small
[15:09] don't know when you grew up so fast
[15:22] I wish... 
[15:24] that Azka had ever expressed so much of love for me
[15:30] but maybe her heart & soul is empty, it doesn't have any love
[15:35] she only sees herself in every kind of mirror
[15:41] and after that Altamash
[15:49] its such a big day of your life
[15:53] don't be upset
[15:55] go happily, ok?
[16:01] Arfa
[16:04] if I ask you something
[16:09] will you answer me?
[16:23] dear, go & check on Arfa, Whether she got ready or not
[16:26] ask her to be quick
[16:29] don't know why sister Sanober is taking so long
[16:32] she doesn't have any shame or realization
[16:35] she handover all the responsibilities to me when its her family's occasion
[16:39] and when its my turn, she got lost like guests
[16:44] I'm coming... 
[16:51] from the day I grew up & until today
[16:55] I had always seen mom & Azka doing only hatred, sowing & reaping bad & doing conspiracies only
[17:06] mom had mutiny with uncle
[17:09] enmity with aunt Sanober & complains from an entire world
[17:17] She used to think that everyone took away her right
[17:21] got her love marriage ended and then
[17:24] her marriage with my father couldn't last for a very long time
[17:30] She couldn't compete uncle or aunt Sanober financially ever
[17:36] and the biggest
[17:39] was her physical disability
[17:42] that she couldn't accept till date
[17:47] everything got infected like an ulcer
[17:51] and her each & every thinking became bitter like poison
[17:56] and every action became thorny like a thorn
[18:03] but Azka
[18:06] what's the reason behind Azka's hatred with me?
[18:10] I had always considered her as my sister
[18:15] also I had given her rights
[18:19] Altamash used to like you, Rutba
[18:23] was this reason less?
[18:27] aunt Sanober & uncle Bazil used to love you a lot
[18:33] and Altamash... he used to circle around you at all times
[18:39] Azka used to feel so jealous from within
[18:45] she used to keep smiling & laughing in front of you
[18:49] and used to annoy you from Altamash's name
[18:52] but she used to shout & yell after coming home
[18:57] she used to give a lot of curses to you & Altamash
[19:06] curses do come back
[19:09] I wish, Azka would have understood this
[19:14] she could have said to me once
[19:17] that if she didn't get Altamash, then she will die
[19:21] then maybe, she didn't had to do all these conspiracies
[19:29] Rutba... she wanted your happiness more than Altamash
[19:50] don't be mad Azka, what's wrong with you?
[19:53] your sister's in-laws are here. What will they think if you will do any inappropriate act
[19:59] my heart will burst...
[20:00] you aren't getting it. I.. 
I cannot see them together
[20:05] ok...
make Altamash distant from her, go tell her
[20:08] Azka... distract yourself. Come on
[20:12] lets start the ritual of henna, lets apply henna to your sister
[20:14] I feel like shooting her!
[20:16] why do you say such things about your sister?
[20:32] Greetings!
Greetings, congratulations!
[20:36] my child... my eyes were yearning to see you
[20:41] sister, shall I make a complain to you?
[20:43] its her sister's wedding, you could have sent her a few days earlier
[20:46] when I had put restrictions on her, that I will put now?
[20:50] actually Altamash had said that since its her sister's wedding so she will dance day & night and will become restless
[20:57] and who will be responsible if she incurs any loss?
[21:01] absolutely correct!
[21:05] that's why I showed patience by thinking that an upcoming baby is our first responsibility
[21:11] I pray that everything goes well
[21:13] Ok...
aunt, Rutba didn't come?
[21:16] she came, she is inside the room with Arfa
[21:19] good thing...
[21:20] Come, Mr.s Tariq is here from America. She was asking about you
[21:22] really!
good to hear that
[21:24] I was thinking that..
[21:28] Altamash
[21:36] don't talk to Rutba about anything
[21:41] in fact, don't you dare to look at her
[21:48] I deserve your entire attention, right?
[22:28] she had got Altamash long time ago
[22:32] but she is still not happy
[22:37] Azka wants to see you unhappy & unsatisfied from the bottom of her heart
[22:43] Rutba listen
[22:47] neither I am despicable, nor I am the enemy of my blood relations
[22:51] I have told you everything. Each & everything
[22:54] mom & Azka's conspiracies, schemes. Their false claim of love
[23:01] All those things due to which you & Altamash were separated
[23:13] I am telling you all this, do you know why?
[23:18] why?
[23:20] so that whenever you will achieve everything in your life, everything!
[23:25] respect, love, care, peace ..
[23:29] so that, then you can make your heart bigger & forgive my mother & sister
[23:34] otherwise, Azka will never stay happy
[23:38] and like our mother's life, her after life will also be ruined
[23:51] please Rutba
[23:53] whenever you can make your heart that much bigger in your life
[23:58] then please do forgive my mother's & sister's mistakes
[24:03] I know, they did so wrong with you & uncle
[24:09] but I don't want your curses to affect my family
[24:33] come on, stop crying
[24:37] you look good while smiling
[25:47] you are looking like a fairy
[25:49] but fairies makes a person go crazy, they do magic. Be careful!
[25:55] what do you think? Am I in my senses?
[25:57] how is it possible that Altamash doesn't looses his senses after seeing Rutba? Its against Altamash's pride
[26:03] these words of yours had made me go crazy
[26:06] hmm...
[26:09] come on, then lets make everyone go crazy together
[26:41] Azka
[26:44] what are you doing?
[26:45] look at both of them
[26:49] how they are dancing together
[26:51] Okay
[26:52] I'm telling you, let me insult her once in this gathering full of people
[26:57] only after that Rutba will stay away from my husband
[26:59] don't be mad Azka, what's with you!
[27:03] your sister's in-laws are here. What will they think if you will do any inappropriate act
[27:08] my heart will burst... you aren't getting it. I..
[27:12] I cannot see them together
[27:14] ok...
make Altamash distant from her, go tell her
[27:17] Azka... distract yourself. Come on
[27:21] lets start the ritual of henna, lets apply henna to your sister
[27:23] I feel like shooting her!
[27:25] why do you say such things about your sister?
[27:28] you don't know what she did to me!
[27:31] I will tell you once the function ends
[27:34] We'll discuss it after the departure of the guests
[27:36] Okay, fix yourself now
[27:37] as I said, we'll discuss it after the departure of the guests
[27:39] I am going inside
Azka
[28:32] won't you have dinner?
[28:35] I will... you also eat
[28:50] listen!
[29:05] nothing!
[29:11] Okay then tell me, what shall I eat?
[29:16] Deceit
[29:23] I mean, we shall deceit the world for sometime
[29:31] or perhaps, we shall be deceived ourselves
[29:36] our getting close is deceit
[29:42] No Rutba
[29:46] its not deceit
[29:49] our coming close to each other is the biggest reality of our lives
[29:54] Please! Don't say such big things
[29:58] I don't believe your such words anymore
[30:04] Rutba, just once..
[30:06] believe me for once, I will do whatever you will ask me to do
[30:15] but do go to the airport to see him off
[30:19] and tell him that you will be restlessly waiting for him to return
[31:28] why there is so much of sadness on your face?
[31:33] maybe...
[31:35] it came to my face after coming out of your heart
[31:42] I didn't get it
[31:46] but I am getting it
[31:51] leaving without meeting Rutba cannot give you any sort of happiness
[32:01] I would have become more upset if I would have met her
[32:05] if sadness completes a person
[32:10] then sadness is better than fake happiness
[32:14] I really wanted you to meet Rutba once before leaving
[32:25] Thousands of desires, each worth dying for…
many of them I have realized…yet I yearn for more…
[32:32] I call her Goddess of stone
[32:38] and Goddess of stone never cares about anyone's feelings
[32:44] lets go now, a lot of other trails are left now
[32:56] Khursheed...
[33:03] Greetings!*
[33:08] also Good bye too!
[33:11] I came to bid you farewell
[33:17] why are you in such a hurry?
[33:21] why did you bother yourself by coming here?
[33:23] We have already bid farewell to each other
[33:33] Ms. Tazmeen, come quickly. I am waiting for you
[33:56] its good that I met you
[34:02] I...
[34:08] I wanted to talk to you
[34:11] tell me, Rutba
[34:17] since you have raised your hand
[34:21] it feels as if
[34:26] my heart is imprisoned in its own cage
[34:36] you shall know the answer of whatever you did, but...
[34:41] I shouldn't have raised my hand on you
[34:45] I should have kept the honor of Khursheed's name
[34:48] I?
[34:50] what as such I have done?
[34:56] honestly speaking, at first even I didn't believed it that...
[35:01] you can do any such thing
[35:05] its fine that you have told Khursheed about me & Altamash
[35:13] but... you had sent mine & Altamash's pictures to my father
[35:24] I didn't expected this from you
[35:26] Rutba! what are you saying?
[35:32] would I be able to face Khursheed Hasan ever after doing such a disgusting act?
[35:40] how can you even think of it?
[35:43] nobody knew this secret except for you
[35:47] why not?
[35:49] the one who knew this secret, it was his benefit in revealing it
[35:55] Rutba, you are really very simple & innocent
[36:01] you couldn't understand such a small thing
[36:06] I am not only disappointed on the fact, that you had raised your hand on me
[36:12] I am disappointed on the fact, that you couldn't understand me even after spending so much of time with me
[36:24] but how can I make complain to you?
[36:26] you couldn't even understood Khrusheed Hassan too
[36:30] Tazmeen!
[36:37] but you had said that if I wouldn't have come in between
[36:44] then you would have fallen in love with Khursheed
[36:48] that matter has been lost in the maze of our past
[36:54] and my passion has become dead long time ago, because of the strength of yours & Khursheed's relation
[37:10] then...
[37:15] then I want that..
[37:19] you shall make this passion alive once again
[37:23] for yourself and...
[37:26] for Khursheed too
[37:30] tell him what real happiness is
[37:38] Khursheed
[37:42] Khursheed is very nice, also you are a very nice person
[37:49] only a decent & graceful girl like you suits him
[37:59] Rutba, what are you saying?
[38:02] I am saying the truth
[38:05] after giving it a lot of thought
[38:12] I want you both to stay happy
[38:19] I will wait that..
[38:23] when you people will come back then
[38:28] you shall be together
[38:38] Good bye!
[38:41] I'm leaving
[38:48] Khursheed must be waiting for you
