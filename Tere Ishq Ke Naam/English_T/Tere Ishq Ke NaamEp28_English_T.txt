[00:15] you are doing so much of politics, sister
[00:19] you can change my name from Ronaq if I didn't made you fall on your face
[00:22] now you'll see, how many birds I will kill from one arrow
[00:28] Transfer Saeedpur lands & Sheikhupura factories in my name
[00:37] also your mansion too
[00:43] I do have a right to test you this much
[01:00] who is it?
[01:02] brother, may I come in?
[01:04] yes come in, Ronaq
[01:25] is everything alright?
[01:27] yes brother, sorry for disturbing you at this hour of the night
[01:33] I know you are also not well, but I am helpless
[01:39] because if I will not make you aware of such circumstances, then it will create more difficulties
[01:45] that's why I came on this inappropriate time, so that I can talk to you clearly
[01:54] I cannot discuss this matter in front of Rutba
[02:01] go ahead, whatever you want to say
[02:18] ask her once by considering her your life partner, & your loyal friend from the bottom of your heart
[02:25] Rutba, do you love me or not?
[02:29] do you need my companionship or not?
[02:33] do you want me to come back or not?
[02:36] then see what answer Rutba gives
[02:47] who is this?
[02:51] hello!
[02:54] hello Khursheed!
[02:56] this is Azka speaking
[03:00] tell me, why you have called me?
[03:04] you have forgotten so many things, and I have called to remind you that
[03:10] what do you mean? I didn't get it
[03:12] you have forgotten your honor, Khursheed
[03:16] Rutba is your wife, your respect, your honor
[03:20] by what means she is after my husband?
[03:23] she roams around with him openly while holding his hands
[03:27] talks to him, laughs with him. Also she flirts with him
[03:31] if its in her control, she can snatch away Altamash from me & make him his
[03:35] if her love was so blind then why did she married you?
[03:39] and let me ask you, if you were such a fool then why didn't you married a simple girl like you are?
[03:46] Rutba will not come in your control
[03:48] she wants such a husband who beats her ten times & count it as one
[03:53] its out of question for you
[03:55] Azka look! I am respecting you a lot
[03:59] but there is a limit of tolerance!
[04:01] don't compel me to use the same language with you, that you are using with me
[04:07] Khursheed, you have spent your entire life on the charity of Rutba's father
[04:10] how will you gather so much of courage?
[04:12] from where you'll get the tongue in your mouth to say anything?
[04:15] who is living on whose money is not hidden from anyone in the entire family, Azka
[04:23] and next time, think hundreds of times before calling me
[04:27] don't forget that I know you since childhood
[04:29] Khursheed!
[04:32] Khursheed, I haven't called to hurt you
[04:36] I just wanted to wake up your honor
[04:40] Rutba is deceiving you
[04:43] control her, put chains in her feet
[04:46] if possible, call her over there
[04:50] I don't need your suggestions at all, Azka
[04:55] what I need to do, I know it very well
[04:59] and next time before blaming Rutba, look at yourself in the mirror first
[05:05] Okay, maybe you don't believe me
[05:09] I am sending you a video, look at it carefully
[05:14] the same way, I have seen it as a wife
[05:20] handle everything before its too late
[06:19] Ronaq, think about it very carefully before taking my daughter's name & before putting an allegation on her
[06:26] I cannot guarantee Altamash's character
[06:29] but Rutba is my daughter
[06:32] She will honor her father's respect & dignity by any means
[06:38]  fathers always think like this about their daughters, brother
[06:42] Rutba is fortunate that she is Mehr Ali Khan's daughter
[06:46] if she had been Tanvir Ali Khan's daughter, then disability would have been written in her fate too
[06:51] Ronaq!
[06:53] stay in your limits!
[06:56] brother... even today I can feel the poison of that bullet in my veins
[07:03]  my every vein is very bitter from head to toe
[07:07] I cannot forget that scene
[07:10] that's why I want that no father shall ever fire on his daughter
[07:15] if your daughter is precious to you, then my daughter is also precious to me
[07:19] Azka is my everything, she is my life etc...
[07:23] that's why I came to beg for her happiness from you at this hour of the night
[07:30] you don't know brother
[07:34] but Rutba & Altamash are in contact with each other since long time, also they are meeting too
[07:43] they are planning to marry each other after removing Khursheed from between them
[07:48] and that too under your nose
[07:53] you weren't present in Arfa's henna ceremony
[07:58] even that night, both of them were planning about their wedding
[08:02] what!
[08:05] brother, I am telling the truth. I have heard it with my own ears
[08:10] Rutba wants to take divorce from Khursheed
[08:13] that's why Khursheed didn't took her along with him, although you had insisted a lot
[08:19] do something brother, but please save my Azka's life from getting ruined
[08:26] sending back Rutba to Khursheed is the only & last solution of this matter
[08:31] and... write something as such in Azka's name that Altamash shall never think about going back to Rutba
[08:40] brother
[08:42] the night our father had shot me
[08:46] you were accompanying him
[08:48] that shot had ruined my life
[08:53] brother, today I am asking you for the compensation of those moments
[08:59] try to control Rutba's emotions
[09:02] and chain up Altamash's intentions
[09:05] only you can do this
[09:31] Transfer Saeedpur lands & Sheikhupura factories in my name
[09:38] also your mansion too
[09:41] I do have a right to test you this much
[10:27] speak up
[10:31] finally you remembered that Rutba also lives here
[10:41] speak up Khursheed
[10:44] why you have called?
[10:45] I wanted to forget Rutba
[10:48] but you don't let me forget it
[10:50] I want to live in peace, but you don't let me live in peace as well
[10:55] I wish I had broken uncle's heart once
[10:59] then today I wouldn't have to break again & again
[11:04] you have drowned me in the sea of humiliation in such a manner, where I can't see my existence anymore
[11:11] I know that you've become such a big personality today
[11:14] you have gone very high
[11:19] but I haven't become so worthless
[11:23] that whatever you'll say I will listen & accept
[11:28] what kind of indictment is this?
[11:31] that you didn't give a chance to the criminal for the justification, after putting an allegation
[11:36] just announce the punishment
[11:39] end this fake matter
[11:41] that we used to be together sometime
[11:43] believe me, I will not ask you for the justification of even a single word
[11:50] you are roaming around in the free air with your favorite & like-minded girl
[11:57] and I shall give the justification?
[12:01] tell me
[12:03] you need the justification of what?
[12:06] let me send you the details of your deeds & misdeeds right away, Rutba
[12:09] you are falsifying me, but how will you falsify yourself?
[12:14] look at your video for once
[12:17] I will bend down my head & become quiet, but how will you shut the mouth of the people around you?
[12:27] I beg you..
[12:29] don't fall from your status to an extent that the people associated to you shall also fall
[12:34] it doesn't make any difference to you
[12:36] but your Honorable father will die
[12:39] enough Khursheed! Enough is enough
[12:43] there is no room of a single word between us anymore
[12:48] there is a room for a few words, Rutba
[12:51] and maybe you need them too
[12:55] Alright Khursheed Hasan
[12:58] you are free to make a decision about leaving me
[13:03] you can leave me whenever you want to
[13:09] maybe this way it will be easier for you to make your future decisions
[13:14] just think
[13:17] that Rutba Mehr Ali
[13:20] was never in your life
[13:25] you have already decided it, Rutba
[13:27] even I don't have to say it
[13:31] Khursheed Hasan was a joke for you, he is still a joke & will always stay a joke
[13:38] Bye!
[15:29] brother, if you will not control this matter now
[15:32] then nothing will be left behind
[15:35] Rutba & Altamash has already decided
[15:39] and Altamash has said that soon he will marry Rutba
[15:43] and Rutba is also agreed
[15:49] words aren't useless, Ronaq
[15:53] one needs to pay for it after using them
[16:02] you know that, right?
[16:03] I know, brother
[16:05] everyone is my loved one for me, they are my blood relation
[16:10] only I know how I have uttered such words from my mouth
[16:15] but separate Rutba from Altamash by any means, and send her back to Khursheed otherwise...
[16:23] I fear to say such words
[16:27] but the basis of all the three families will be shaken
[16:31] Altamash is quite an emotional & furious guy
[16:35] but Rutba
[16:37] that poor girl's house will ruined second time as well
[16:45] I am leaving now, brother
[16:48] take care
[17:07]  the basis of all the three families will be shaken
[17:11] Altamash is quite an emotional & furious guy
[17:15] but Rutba
[17:17] that poor girl's house will ruined second time as well
[17:47] so uncle, have you become successful in your motive?
[17:51]  you have turned her against me
[17:54] but you & Khursheed together cannot make me bend
[18:04] for your ego & satisfaction, you did whatever you like so I will also do whatever I like
[18:08]  I will give you such a wound that you won't be able to forget for life time!
[18:10] Stop your rubbish, you absurd guy!
[18:13] you are not worthy enough, that I shall wed off my only daughter to you
[18:17] but still, I had handover her to you
[18:19] brother, my son came here to marry your daughter & your are insulting him!
[18:26] Ronaq is absolutely correct!
[18:28] that brother like to insult everyone in public
[18:41] Okay uncle, lets end it then
[18:44] listen to me very carefully I am divorcing Rutba
[18:57] you cannot do this, Altamash
[18:59] you cannot do this!
[19:02] Rutba, I divorce you!
[19:09] I divorce you! I divorce you!
[19:18] have you become happy on your decisions?
[19:22] now let your daughter live in peace with empty hands
[19:40] dad!
[19:43] dad, what happened?
Aunty!
[19:46] aunt Rasheeda! is somebody there?
[19:49] dad, what happened to you?
dad, open your eyes. Please...
[19:53] aunt Rasheeda!
[19:56] is there anyone!
[20:18] please dad, don't say this please...
[20:25] I have no one except for you, please
[20:29] I don't want anyone, I don't want anything. Please...
[20:33] I cannot live
[21:46] what's there to laugh about?
[21:50] there I have lit a fire in the father's heart
[21:55] and here, you have lit the fire on the husband's trust & belief
[21:59] it seems Rutba will turn herself into ashes while burning you
[22:03] and then she'll keep wandering in Mehr Ali house like an ash
[22:11] mom, the matter is not about Khursheed's or uncle's trust
[22:15] the matter is about Altamash's planning
[22:18] until it won't fail, till then mine & Altamash's relation will stay in danger
[22:23] why are you worrying about it, Azka?
[22:25] its brother's work to handle Altamash
[22:28] and nobody can do this task better than him
[22:31] we have done our work
now you'll see
[22:34] the further path will become easier
[22:38] Rasheed & Rutba's relation is very important for brother
[22:42] its his entire life's asset
[22:44] he will never compromise on it
[22:47] no matter if he has to loose his life for that
[22:56] its aunt Sanober's call
[22:59] so late night?
[23:02] yes sister, greetings! Is everything alright?
[23:07] what!
[23:09] brother is in the hospital?
[23:11] but I just came back a while ago after meeting him
[23:16] so, why you had gone there?
[23:21] actually...
[23:50] the doctor is calling you, as the patient wants to speak to you
[24:22] dad
[24:27] dad, what has happened to you?
[24:41] dad please keep it on. You need it please
[24:48] Rutba
[24:52] this is called life
[24:56] two shoulders
[25:00] and the burden on them
[25:04] and two empty hands
[25:08] Besides...
[25:12] neither properties nor house
[25:16] nor wealth...
[25:18] or children
[25:21] nothing...
[25:25] what are you saying?
[25:28] I need you
[25:31] a lot of people needs you
[25:34] dear..
[25:36] the love of our loved ones keep us alive
[25:41] but disloyalty kills
[25:46] don't even think of being disloyal to Khursheed
[25:52] because, you have no one except for him after me
[26:01] dad
[26:02] no one
[26:03] I don't need anyone, I have no concern with anyone
[26:07] I need you only
[26:12] I...
[26:14] I just want my father's happiness
[26:20] you...
[26:22] you want to marry Altamash after taking divorce from Khursheed
[26:33] Rutba remember...
[26:37] if you did this
[26:40] then your father will stay upset in another world as well
[26:45] dad
[26:47] value Khursheed
[26:50] don't get separated from him
[26:54] what are you saying? There isn't any such thing, its all a lie
[26:59] there isn't any such thing. Who said this to you?
[27:06] if this is the matter then...
[27:11] shut the mouth of yours & mine enemies from my grave's mud
[27:21] dad
[27:25] Rutba listen
[27:29] the entire life, your father has fulfilled all his relations with complete honesty
[27:42] he had never been dishonest with any relation
[27:46] also he won't do that until his last breath
[27:52] remember ...
[27:56] you are my daughter
[28:05] dad, please don't say such things. Please dad
[28:11] No...
[28:12] I have no one except for you, please
[28:16] I don't want anyone, I don't want anything. Please...
[28:20] I cannot live
[28:44] dad
[28:58] dad
[29:03] dad!

[31:58] how come he got unwell all of a sudden?
[32:01] what happened to brother? and when? What are the doctors saying?
[32:07] Rutba, tell us something
[32:09] tell us Rutba, what are the doctors saying?
[32:12] she isn't saying anything
[32:13] Rutba
[32:17] doctor, how is brother?
[32:20] I'm sorry, he is no more
[32:24] To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return
[32:27] brother is no more! Oh.. my brother has died
[32:33] how is this possible? Bazil...
[32:37] Bazil, brother Mehr Ali has died
[32:50] he was the biggest support of us sisters
[34:52] Khursheed, come quickly
[34:55] today you've become an orphan in real
[34:58] the one who used to protect you & save you from the bitterness of this world
[35:05] he has left this world
[35:07] today, my brother... my guardian has died
[35:15] Khursheed, come quickly
[35:20] have a look at your father like uncle's face once again
[35:28] there is a lot of peace & satisfaction on his face
[35:35] the satisfaction of the hearts of all of us is on his face
[35:39] come quickly, Khursheed...
[35:46] I wish I could come, mom
[35:49] if it was in my control, then I would have come to you in a second
[35:57] uncle was just like my father
[36:01] today he has left this world and I am not there
[36:17] madam, they are calling you as they are taking away sir's dead for the final rights
[38:12] show me his face one last time, we won't be able to see him again ever
[38:18] we will never be able to see him again
[38:22] tell them...
