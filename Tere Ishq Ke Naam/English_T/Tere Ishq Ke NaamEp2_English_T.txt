[01:01] Stop!
[01:21] lets go!
[01:58] Khursheed Hasan
[02:04] yes sir
[02:05] haven't you seen the mirror while leaving home?
[02:08] yes sir?
[02:09] go inside the washroom & look at the mirror
[03:27] greetings, brother
[03:30] what had happened with us, sister!
[03:34] what brother has done?
[03:36] my heart is bleeding
[03:38] he insulted our son Altamash in front of that low class guy!
[03:45] I was amazed! I was staring at his face, I couldn't utter a single word
[03:50] what does brother think of us? Are we made up of wax?
[03:54] that he can turn us towards any side
[03:57] where is Altamash?
[04:00] he is locked inside his room since last night, he isn't talking to anyone
[04:04] oh! my dear child... 
[04:09] why are you standing here? Go & check on him
[04:13] fix his mood, explain & comfort him. Appease him & bring him here
[04:22] yes mom
[04:24] let me try
[04:44] hi!
[04:47] Azka you!
[04:53] what's the matter?
[04:56] didn't you like my arrival?
[04:59] Azka, my mood is very off
[05:01] I don't want to meet or talk to anyone
[05:05] I don't want to say anything bitter in anger & anyone shall get hurt with it
[05:12] and if someone likes your bitter words too
[05:15] then?
[05:28] Altamash, you are in pain. How can I leave you alone?
[05:34] Talk to me! Talking will reduce the pain
[05:41] I promise you!
[05:43] even if you say anything bitter, I will gulp it happily
[05:51] one needs to do all this in order to fulfill their relation with their loved ones
[05:55] and then... 
[05:59] We are not strangers to each other
[06:07] did Rutba called?
[06:10] she did, but I didn't receive
[06:15] but uncle did all this.. 
[06:18] so why are you punishing Rutba?
[06:20] she isn't ready to think beyond uncle's influence
[06:23] dad says this... dad says that
[06:26] dad wants this... dad wants that
[06:29] she has already spent enough of her life with her dad
[06:34] dad's dearest!
[06:39] you are hundred percent right
[06:41] Altamash, do you know
[06:43] the girls who doesn't want to come out of their father's influence
[06:48] they are never able to keep their husband happy
[06:52] you are her to-be-husband
[06:55] how can she give priority to her father's words upon your words?
[07:00] she has to change herself
[07:18] brother, last night there has been a misunderstanding
[07:21] sister Sanober didn't touched a single food item
[07:25] their anger was quite evident
[07:28] Rasheeda, I don't care about anyone's anger
[07:31] I have taken the decision as per my principles
[07:34] for marriage it was decided that Rutba & Altamash will complete their education
[07:39] Altamash left his studies, as its not in my control
[07:42] but I can take decisions for Rutba
[07:45] yes but Rutba is quite sensitive in this matter
[07:48] We have to take care of this as well
[07:51] her mother's sudden death & your extra love has spoiled her a lot
[07:57] No Rasheeda, neither her mother's death nor my unfavorable love
[08:03] in fact, the main reason behind the flaws in Rutba's character are my sisters
[08:08] I wish, I could have kept her away from them since childhood
[08:13] but the last thing is that, I am Rutba's father & fathers don't only give love
[08:19] in fact, they can scold you if required
[08:22] Rutba has to understand that by fulfilling her all the wishes in her life I've just requested her
[08:30] to keep my honor intact
[08:33] Khursheed, come here
[08:39] *greetings!*
[08:42] haven't you gone to give tuition today?
[08:44] and what stains are these on your shirt?
[08:47] I came to change my shirt, it got dirty
[08:51] brother, I am coming in a while. 
Come, let me give you another shirt
[08:59] Sir, this is the mischievousness of our child Rutba. I saw it myself in the morning
[10:13] what's missing in my upbringing, Rutba?
[10:16] what not I did to bring betterment in your identity?
[10:20] I got you enrolled into the best & most expensive schools & colleges
[10:25] is this my fault?
[10:28] dear, love makes you a good person
[10:32] how come you got spoiled? And I didn't get to know
[10:35] dad I.. 
[10:35] I don't want to listen to anything. Not even a single word. Go & apologize to Khursheed
[10:41] dad!
[10:42] didn't you hear me?
[10:43] go & apologize to him for your actions that had hurt him
[10:48] he must have been so hurt
[10:50] you have to apologize to him
[11:07] your status won't change. 
You will still remain the same Khursheed agname Sheeday
[11:13] no matter if you get ten degrees in front of your name still, you cannot become like Altamash
[11:18] and neither my father will transfer any part of his wealth in your name
[11:28] Khursheed...
Khursheed!
[11:38] why you came here?
[11:41] is there anything left for you to do?
[11:44] you haven't done the right thing by complaining to my dad
[11:47] Rutba, only weak people do complains
[11:49] and as weak as you think of me, I am not that weak
[11:56] you think yourself as a very strong person, right?
[11:58] Rutba Ali Khan, people like you become stronger by wealth & money
[12:02] for us, our strength & wealth is our character
[12:06] and you don't have any concern with it
[12:11] you think big of yourself, right?
[12:14] but you don't hold any value
[12:16] you can make my dad a fool by showing that you are better than me & Altamash
[12:21] but its not like that
[12:23] nobody will believe
[12:26] I came to say sorry about morning
[12:28] and its just because dad had asked me to
[12:31] otherwise, Rutba Mehr Ali never apologizes for her actions
[12:37] I know you very well, Rutba Mehr Ali Khan
[12:53] this is not the right time to stay quiet & to gulp the sip of tolerance
[12:57] what about brother!
[12:58] he has been ruling on us sisters uselessly for his entire life
[13:03] now if we will give him anymore chance
[13:05] then he won't keep Altamash as his son-in-law but a servant all his life
[13:11] I won't be forgetting my insult so easily
[13:14] you shouldn't be forgetting it, sister
[13:17] hey! you had gone there as the mother-in-law of his only daughter
[13:21] you hadn't gone there as his sister
[13:23] and you tell me
[13:25] if Rutba had been marrying out of the family, then her in-laws would have tolerated brother's ordering attitude?
[13:32] We haven't tolerated as well, aunt
[13:35] We'll answer too
[13:37] what answer will you give, Altamash?
[13:39] its not in your control to end your relation with Rutba, you cannot do it
[13:44] from where this matter came in between?
[13:48] Mine & Rutba's relation is not associated with uncle's decisions
[13:52] only that will happen what I want
[13:56] look, its the blood of young generation
[13:59] tomorrow, what if they did something inappropriate then who will be responsible?
[14:06] let me talk to brother Mehr Ali
[14:08] He has to think upon his words once again
[14:13] mom, you may talk to uncle & I'll talk to Rutba. I am not agreed for her further education
[14:19] I'll see how uncle will send her to the university
[14:25] Azka
[14:27] I want to talk to you
[14:39] sister... 
[14:42] I'm thinking, its the right time for us to speak to brother about our share of inheritance
[14:48] we won't get any better chance than this
[14:51] say what brother, what do you say?
[14:59] tell me Altamash, what is the matter?
[15:01] you have to bring Rutba here, to my house
[15:05] what if uncle gets to know then?
[15:09] how will he get to know?
[15:11] then what's the use of talking to you?
[15:14] its just you with whom uncle sends her with complete trust
[15:18] he trusts me... 
[15:24] by the way... 
[15:26] why do you want to call her here?
[15:27] I want to make her understand that what does our love means for each other
[15:33] and how important it is for us to become one as soon as possible
[16:09] Your aunt was telling me that you aren't eating your food
[16:15] dear, why are you showing anger to the food?
[16:18] the food is God's gift for us
[16:24] you say the same for me, dad
[16:27] that I am a God's gift for you
[16:30] then why don't you care about my anger?
[16:33] why don't you feel happiness in my happiness?
[16:37] I can see the tears on your eyelids
[16:41] my heart cries seeing you like this, Rutba
[16:46] Will I not care about your happiness or grief?
[16:51] you should also realize, my dear
[16:54] that your father's decision cannot go against the betterment of your future
[16:59] dad, my future doesn't exist without Altamash
[17:03] there is a right time for everything, Rutba
[17:06] the way sea waves moves, once they are gone only sand is left behind them
[17:12] yes, I know they are naive & innocent
[17:18] but dear... ignorance, foolishness & insolence shall be treated
[17:24] one shouldn't give up
[17:26] it was your mother's desire that our daughter shall be well educated
[17:31] she should have sense & knowledge about how to spend her life
[17:36] consider this as your mother's will
[17:39] while dying she had said to Bashera... 
[17:42] that you need to focus on Rutba's education in the same manner as you do for Khursheed Hasan
[17:46] Khursheed, Khursheed, Khursheed! Dad, you've made this name disgusting for me since my childhood
[17:55] this comparison from childhood have made me hate Khursheed
[18:00] Rutba!
[18:02] his mother has done your brought up more likely than your own mother
[18:05] you have shared Khursheed's mother's time. You have shared his love & attention
[18:10] Khursheed should be having a complain with you
[18:13] So, what's the big deal? What not you did for them?
[18:17] what they would have if you weren't there?
[18:20] you gave them a space to live in such a big house, otherwise they would have been on some foot path
[18:25] Rutba!!
[18:28] what language you are speaking? Whose words are these?
[18:32] who taught you this bad manners of talking?
[18:36] I know... 
[18:38] that's why I want to give you & Altamash some time
[18:42] if one gets wealth, respect & properties in heritage then its loses the value
[18:47] only good & positive thinking value these blessings
[18:53] my motive is not to get you a degree only
[18:56] but to give you a good & positive thinking
[19:01] listen to me very carefully Rutba, wherever you go on a hunger strike or something else
[19:06] you have to complete your education at any cost
[21:02] thank God you both came..
[21:04] You guys did very well by coming here
[21:07] I feel like dying while staying in that room all alone
[21:10] oh God! this wretched love... it has imprisoned people inside the room
[21:15] and its roaming outside freely
[21:17] I hope somebody shall put handcuffs on this love, otherwise both of us will be killed for no reason
[21:22] Ok come outside with me, I want to talk to you about so many things
[21:37] I think something got stuck in my throat
[21:40] Khr.... Khrrr...
[21:43] Khursheed...  Sheeday
[21:48] do you know, what's the meaning of KHRR?
[21:50] Donkey!
[21:53] if he had been a bit educated, then he would have known
[21:59] you all may leave, I will explain you in the next class
[22:03] go!
[22:08] do you know, we get to know about one's personality by their name
[22:12] and a person whose name is "Sheeda", then what will his personality be like?
[22:20] do you know, how we get to know about a person's status & worth?
[22:25] by their tongue
[22:28] if a person's thinking stays small, even after going to an expensive school while having all the luxuries
[22:35] then the person lacks humanity
[22:40] and a donkey is also better than that person
[22:50] what does he think of himself? He scolded us
[22:54] has he forgotten this status?
[22:56] Rutba, do complain uncle about him
[22:59] tell him that he had misbehaved with us. So that he can fix him
[23:03] He spoiled the entire mood. Leave him. Come & lets have tea inside my room
[23:07] hey! we'll drink tea at Altamash's house now
[23:12] get ready, he called you
[23:17] really!
[23:25] Khursheed
[23:29] dear, I wanted to discuss something with you. Can you take out some time?
[23:33] what are you saying, uncle? Please order
[23:36] have you got free from the tuition?
[23:37] yes
[23:38] come with me
[23:40] yes, let me keep them inside first
[23:43] Okay fine
[23:48] I hope Altamash will like me, as he likes this color a lot on me
[23:52] yes, its good
[23:55] but there is one problem
[23:58] what?
[24:00] You seem like a beetroot in some farm
[24:07] don't believe on her words, she is being jealous
[24:11] you are looking so pretty
[24:12] you are such a sweetheart & you!
[24:16] you are so clever since childhood, so I don't mind
[24:21] its looking good, right?
[24:23] absolutely perfect!
[24:28] you have got ready like a bride
[24:32] did you ask uncle?
[24:38] sister, I must say... this time control the girl completely
[24:43] I don't find brother's intentions good
[24:46] what if we lose the matter & the girl as well
[24:49] don't you worry, Ronaq. The girl is completely controlled by my son
[24:53] brother doesn't have any idea about his daughter's madness!
[24:58] right sister, but try explaining Altamash
[25:01] our motive is not to get the girl from that house, in fact we want our complete right as well
[25:11] everything belongs to my Altamash, Ronaq
[25:15] Everything!
[25:19] I haven't associated my Altamash's proposal with Rutba uselessly
[25:22] brother will spend the entire wealth on charity etc...
[25:27] our father's wealth would have been distributed among orphans or so...
[25:32] now you'll see, after getting married to Rutba my Altamash will handle everything
[25:39] God willing
[25:50] when I look at you, I feel proud on your mother's upbringing
[25:56] I wish, Rutba hadn't shown so much haste in showing her likeness towards Altamash
[26:09] Khursheed...
[26:11] your tea
[26:20] why brother Mehr had called you?
[26:29] mom, he had asked me to do something which is not possible for me
[26:41] He wants to change Rutba's way of thinking
[26:45] he wants me to educate her
[26:47] Khursheed, its just a hope nothing else to fix a building with weak basis
[26:58] after Sajida's sudden death...
[27:00] I tried very hard to keep Rutba away from her aunt's thinking & shadow
[27:07] but she hadn't considered me anything else except for her nanny
[27:12] her aunts fraudster & diplomatic behavior has made her their slave
[27:23] mom, we have always fulfilled our responsibilities very well
[27:26] We only took that much from that house, for which we are capable of
[27:31] We don't have any stain on our intentions
[27:33] yes Khursheed
[27:35] even after brother Mehr's a lot of insistence
[27:39] I hadn't agreed to stay inside that bungalow
[27:41] this quarter is the proof of my honesty & truth
[27:46] otherwise, Rutba's aunts wouldn't have left an inch to blame me in order to stain my character
[27:53] They are way too jealous of us mother son duo for no reason
[28:20] guess who?
[28:24] the same person who is the reason of my morning & evening
[28:37] why weren't you talking to me?
[28:42] One gets out of words when pain increases
[28:46] uncle hadn't done good with me
[28:48] if I hadn't honored our relation, then I would have told him who Altamash is
[28:55] my heart knows who is Altamash
[28:58] I don't care about anyone
[29:02] Rutba...
[29:04] these two days were like the day of judgment without you
[29:11] Its not possible for me to stay away from you
[29:17] uncle's decision is unacceptable to me
[29:30] dad's decision is like a sand wall in front of my insistence
[29:36] I want your companionship in my life, nothing else
[29:39] listen to me, Rutba
[29:43] you don't know your father to an extent that my mother & aunt Ronaq knows
[29:48] if uncle gets stubborn on something, then he doesn't honor any relation or love at all
[29:53] dad isn't like that, Altamash
[29:55] my dad loves me a lot, he takes very good care of me. He listens to whatever I say
[30:00] you'll see, I will explain him & he will understand
[30:03] you will not go to the university
[30:06] this is my decision!
[30:10] I won't go
[30:12] We'll get married this year, and uncle has to accept this
[30:17] he will accept it
[30:18] and if uncle will refuse, then we'll marry without telling him
[30:26] Altamash, how is this possible?
[30:29] how can we get married without telling dad, he will get angry
[30:34] No, no...
[30:36] you know my father, we cannot do this
[30:39] even you know me very well, right?
[30:42] whatever I decide once I ensure to do it
[30:44] I am unable to spend my life without you
[30:47] I want you companionship at any cost
[30:51] I will tolerate uncle's anger, everything!
[30:58] I just want your companionship!
[31:34] so, what did Altamash said?
[31:38] what he has to say?
[31:41] he was expressing his love to me, he was telling me how much he loves me
[31:45] also he was telling me how difficult it has become for him to spend a single moment without me
[31:50] be careful!
[31:52] a lot of meanings are hidden behind men sweet words
[31:56] what do you mean?
[31:58] I wish you weren't Rutba Mehr Ali Khan, but an ordinary girl
[32:03] then I would have seen, how Altamash would have expressed his love to you
[32:12] I hope Altamash hadn't discussed anything about marriage
[32:20] be careful! A Dooms day will arise if any such matter will reach to uncle
[32:49] these two days were like the day of judgment without you
[32:53] Its not possible for me to stay away from you
[32:55] uncle's decision is unacceptable to me
[33:01] the same person who is the reason of my morning & evening
[33:08] you will not go to the university
this is my decision!
[33:11] We'll get married this year, and uncle has to accept this
[33:15] and if uncle will refuse, then we'll marry without telling him
[33:35] greetings brother!
[33:37] greetings to you too, stay blessed
[33:39] greetings, uncle
greetings to you too dear
[33:41] uncle, where is Rutba?
[33:44] She must be inside her room, go meet her
[33:46] Okay, let me go & meet her
[33:51] its a good thing that you got time to meet your brother
[33:55] No brother, I wanted to come
[33:58] today I am here to apologize to you for that day's issue
[34:03] sister shouldn't have talked to you in this tone
[34:05] now see, if one thing is already decided then there is no use of insisting upon it
[34:12] Ronaq, I never wanted to be stubborn or do any argument
[34:15] neither my motive is to go against someone
[34:18] and it wasn't my motive to hurt anyone by refusing for the marriage
[34:24] Not only I want Rutba but Altamash's thinking to become so strong
[34:31] that they get to know the reality of life
[34:34] this greed of properties & wealth in Altamash's head
[34:39] this addiction, it should get over
[34:41] he should have an understanding of life's best motives
[34:45] I want to marry Rutba to this sort of guy
[34:49] absolute brother, you are correct!
[34:53] but Altamash's upbringing is done by his father
[34:57] We shouldn't be amazed on his thinking
[35:01] brother, now see... they have planned that on the occasion of wedding
[35:07] they will make you write all the properties belonging to Rubta
[35:12] I don't understand, what greed Altamash have?
[35:17] and I don't like this at all
[35:20] I accept that whatever you have is of Rutba's eventually
[35:25] but what's the haste for?
[35:28] there is a right time for everything
[35:31] if its done on the wrong time, then its worthless
[35:51] so, what have you decided?
[35:55] I don't know, I am unable to understand anything
[35:58] I can try to convince dad but... 
[36:01] I cannot take such a big step against his consent
[36:05] he will be so angry with me
[36:08] and very sad
[36:10] and maybe... 
[36:12] maybe, he won't be able to forgive me ever. He can never tolerate this
[36:26] So, will you be able to tolerate Altamash's anger?
[36:38] Altamash has got such a long life!
[36:45] anyways, you will get busy now
[36:48] So, what's my work here. I shall leave now
[36:53] hello!... yes
[36:57] nothing just like that... you tell me
[37:16] uncle
[37:21] yes Azka, why are you standing there? Come, sit
[37:40] please forgive me, uncle
[37:42] I am very guilty of lying to you
[37:46] even mom has scolded me a lot for all of this
[37:49] but... Altamash & Rutba had compelled me
[37:57] Azka, speak clearly. What are you trying to say?
[38:03] I am unable to understand your point
[38:09] yesterday, Rutba had gone to aunt's Sanober's house with me to meet Altamash
[38:16] I tried explaining both of them a lot, but both of them are crazy about love
[38:21] Rutba shouldn't have broken your trust like this
[38:25] now see, yesterday Altamash was saying that if uncle didn't agree for the marriage
[38:31] then both of them will get married without your consent
[38:38] you should have told me all of this before telling a lie & taking Rutba with you
[38:43] I hate the witness more than the criminal itself
[38:47] please forgive me, uncle
[38:49] you may leave
