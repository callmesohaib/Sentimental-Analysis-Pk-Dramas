[00:37] listen Khursheed, you are just a sand wall for me 
[00:42] whenever I would like to go anywhere, you won't be able to stop me
[00:45] therefore, keep your concern & care with you
[00:51] and you also listen to me 
[00:56] uncle's word is final verdict for me
[00:58] and if you won't listen to his order 
[01:01] then it will be very difficult for you to leap over this sand wall
[01:49] Miss, Rutba has never written a single word of her assignment with her hands till date
[01:53] in fact, she doesn't even know the topic of the assignment
[01:57] all of her work is done by her cousin
[01:59] All of us make our notes & assignment with a lot of hard work & Rutba takes the best grades
[02:05] not fair!
[02:07] Okay, please sit
[02:19] what shall I do, Altamash?
[02:22] Khursheed & aunt Rasheeda doesn't leave me alone for a single second
[02:26] don't make excuses Rutba, don't stall me. This is the time to show courage
[02:30] there is no importance of excuses in our life
[02:33] we are standing next to uncle, and now it will be a foolishness to step back
[02:36] you don't know uncle
[02:38] He uses all of his trump cards on the right time
[02:53] I'll talk to you later
[02:55] Bye!
[03:09] Rutba, why didn't you attend the class? Ms. Sadaf was asking about you
[03:13] actually I am having a severe headache
[03:16] Ms. Sadaf has called you inside the library
[03:19] Ok, thanks!
[03:21] Okay
[03:28] its not an ordinary matter that brother has gone to see the properties all of a sudden
[03:32] I had talked to Nisar Ali
[03:35] I had tried asking him indirectly, but he stalled me
[03:38] and I have understood a lot from this
[03:42] what are you trying to say, aunty?
[03:45] you cannot understand brother's conspiracies, Altamash
sister & I have tolerated him a lot
[03:51] brother will try his level best to keep you away from land & properties related matters
[03:57] he wants to test you
[03:59] and what will you do by getting only Rutba?
[04:01] Rutba is Rutba Mehr Ali 
[04:04] when a lot of properties & wealth is associated to her name
[04:09] Ronaq is absolutely correct, Altamash
[04:12] let brother do whatever he wants to do
[04:15] and we will do whatever we want to do
[04:19] bring Rutba here
[04:22] and get married to her before brother comes back
[04:25] and get the property on your name
[04:41] Rutba, this time you've made such an amazing assignment
[04:45] also you have taken the highest marks
[04:48] in the entire department
[04:50] thank you, maam
[04:53] even I haven't read those books which you have mentioned in your reference 
[04:57] and only an intelligent person can make such an assignment
[05:00] from where you took those references & what was the medium?
[05:05] actually...
[05:09] your quietness is telling me that not only you hadn't made the assignment
[05:13] but you haven't read it as well
[05:15] maam.. actually
[05:18] I will keep this matter in front of the head, and you may leave
[05:22] maam... 
[05:23] and yes! pick up your assignment from the staff room
[05:26] maam please... 
maam
[05:51] I had taken away Rutba's cellphone from her
[05:54] but she has another cellphone
[05:57] she is in contact with Altamash. If I wanted, I could have taken the other cellphone from her
[06:02] but when a child starts becoming rebellious then the parents should take one step back
[06:09] I don't want her to realize that her father has restricted the fresh air as well
[06:15] I want her to live & stay happy
[06:19] but with the actual happiness of life
[06:22] yes uncle I am getting it
[06:23] dear, I know that she has a lot of people who shows her the wrong path
[06:27] because politics & rebelliousness is associate side by side
[06:31] keep an eye on Rutba
[06:34] until I come back
[06:36] I will do whatever you are saying
[06:38] It will take the hard work of all of us to bring Rutba to any higher status
[06:43] don't worry uncle, I am with you at every step
[06:47] thank you my dear, I am proud of you
[07:03] I understand all!
[07:05] your motive is to insult & humiliate me by all means
[07:09] then whether its my house, my in-laws house or my university
[07:14] I didn't get it, what... 
[07:18] you have proved your intelligence & my stupidity by making this assignment
[07:23] but its clearly stating that how much jealous & envy you are of me
[07:28] I wish dad can see your true face soon
[08:07] oh! I hate Khursheed so much that I feel like vanishing him from the world
[08:12] I cannot tolerate him!
[08:14] and dad likes him so much
[08:16] I don't understand, what shall I do to him
[08:19] I cannot do anything
[08:21] We can do a lot, & we will do it
[08:24] be patience. I will see Khursheed aka Sheeda myself
[08:28] who had annoyed my Rutba
[08:30] for now listen to me
[08:32] hmm.. say it, I am listening
[08:34] you have to come to our house tomorrow, its my mother's message
[08:39] We will sit & think about how to convince uncle
[08:43] but Altamash, what if my father gets to know then?
[08:46] let him get to know, I'm with you
[08:50] I will send Azka to your house, but you have to leave from there by any means
[08:54] Okay, I will come
[08:58] I will come tomorrow for sure
[08:59] Okay listen!
[09:02] hide the car keys so that Khursheed cannot follow you
[09:07] I want to vanish this Khursheed
[09:10] so that he leaves from our lives, and we can spend our live peacefully
[09:16] enough
[09:59] Khursheed
[10:00] yes
[10:00] dear, I am going inside the bungalow. Don't you have any other work?
[10:04] No mom, I just wanted some tea but I will make it myself
[10:07] ok listen
[10:09] take care of Rutba
[10:11] yes dear, I have promised brother Mehr
[10:14] I have to take care of her
Ok, I am leaving
[12:27] how dare you! Let me go & tell dad right away
[12:31] yes sure
[12:33] greet him from my side
[12:35] also tell him that for what you came in my quarter at this hour of the night
[12:40] listen to me
[12:42] don't come in my way, understand!
[12:47] I am not in your way, Rutba
[12:50] and if you consider me as the dust under your feet
[12:53] I still don't have any problem with it
[12:55] but yes, if the question is about uncle's love & his honor
[13:00] then he is not the hindrance on your way
[13:03] its the sky above your head
[13:06] be thankful
[13:08] that you have a ground under your feet & sky above your head
[13:12] go to sleep now
[13:18] and remember
[13:20] I will be awake the entire night
[13:38] hmm... so this is the matter
[13:41] if its a war then let it be, we are also ready to fight
[13:45] tomorrow you will come to my house for sure
[13:47] I will also see that who can dare to stop my Rutba
[13:51] Altamash calls & Rutba couldn't come
[13:54] its impossible!
[13:56] I will come Altamash
[13:58] be ready
[14:31] uncle, I don't need lands or properties
[14:35] the amount we get from my dad's lands, its enough for my studies expense
[14:39] and soon I will be doing a job
[14:42] besides, mom & I had never wished more than this
[14:46] don't worry about me
[14:47] dear, I am not worried
[14:50] I am proud of you
[14:52] you are not my son, but you had never let me feel that I don't have a son
[14:57] if I have transferred something in your name, then its because of my happiness & honor
[15:02] because I am proud of you
[15:03] thank you so much, uncle
[15:05] your love & trust is enough for me
[15:08] I don't need these lands & properties
[15:13] No Khursheed, I cannot transfer my entire properties on the name of greedy & selfish people
[15:20] I had to tell you that I have transferred a few properties on your name
[15:24] so there is no point of any argument in this matter
[15:27] uncle, I am highly obliged
[15:31] did you went there to transfer the property on my name only?
[15:39] No, there were a lot of other work
[15:41] but all the work is done now
[15:44] I will be back within a few days
[15:47] uncle, try coming back soon as the matters aren't fine here
[15:52] last night, Rutba had tried to take the car keys from my room
[15:59] what did you say?
[16:01] what are Rutba's plans?
[16:03] I don't find those people intentions right, they are compelling Rutba to leave the house
[16:08] Okay Khursheed, Rutba shouldn't leave the house until I come back. Keep an eye on her
[16:14] don't you worry at all! I have explained to the guard & the driver as well
[16:18] besides, mom sleeps inside the bungalow
[16:20] Rutba cannot go anywhere
[16:22] Okay
[16:24] I will come back soon
[16:37] So finally, you have succeeded in your ambition Khursheed Hasan
[16:43] its my turn now
[16:50] Lands in Khursheed's name!
[16:52] oh Ronaq you were right! Absolutely correct
[16:57] It was us who were sitting idle
[17:00] mom, don't worry. I will take back these lands from Khursheed & uncle by any means
[17:10] let Rutba become mine once. Then not just these land & properties, also uncle will breathe with my consent
[17:19] very good!
[17:20] this is called manly gesture
[17:23] quickly call Ronaq, ask her to come here immediately
[17:28] the matte is slipping from our hand, Its high time now
[17:33] We will give thee next shock to brother Mehr Ali
[17:39] he did his move already
[17:41] now we'll make our move
[17:49] the same thing happened that we were afraid of
[17:51] brother is playing all his cards very cleverly
[17:56] now I feel that he doesn't want Rutba to get married to Altamash
[18:05] uncle's thoughts will die automatically
[18:08] I will hurt him in such a manner, that he will never try to become a hindrance on my way ever
[18:14] Rutba is mine
[18:16] and she will always stay mine
[18:22] you are right, Ronaq
[18:24] a person who can transfer his lands on the name of a stranger, he can give his daughter as well
[18:29] enough mom!
[18:31] why do you want me to kill someone? Do you want me to be hanged to death?
[18:33] God forbid! may your enemies shall hang to death
[18:36] No Altamash my child, Rutba is yours
[18:40] also each & every inch of my brother's land is yours
[18:44] nobody can eat away your right until your aunt is present
[18:46] I will not let anyone eat away my right
[18:51] Azka
[18:53] I need your help
[18:55] tell me Altamash, what help do you need? I am here for you
[18:59] you need to bring Rutba here immediately
[19:02] Khursheed will not send her with you, beach uncle has forbidden
[19:07] but somehow, we have to bring her here
[19:13] what is your plan, Altamash?
[19:16] why do we have to bring her here? What needs to be done?
[19:18] I want to harm uncle in such a manner that he shall never stand in front of me confidently
[19:25] I will marry Rutba tonight
[20:17] come here
[20:20] mom, leave my hand
[20:22] speak slowly, tell me
[20:24] what is this happening?
[20:26] Altamash is asking me to bring Rutba here
[20:28] to marry her! How can I let this happen?
[20:32] and then uncle! he will blame me for everything
[20:35] Altamash is using us mother daughter duo for his wrong intentions
[20:39] sister & Altamash thinks that they are very clever
[20:42] but my name won't be Ronaq Jahan if I don't repay their clever attitude to them
[20:46] So, what needs to be done now? We have to stop this marriage
[20:50] stop it at any cost, this cannot happen
[20:54] bring Rutba
[20:56] what!
[20:57] bring Rutba & meanwhile send a message to brother & tell him everything clearly
[21:03] I'm sure that he will stop this marriage
[21:06] also he will teach such a lesson to Altamash
[21:09] that next time uncle & his nephew will never see each other's face ever
[21:13] this way, we'll not become the bad guy in Altamash's eyes
[21:16] also not brother's criminals. 
As far as Rutba is concerned
[21:20] So, after falling in her father's eyes she won't be able to get back her status
[21:26] also Altamash will not trust her again
[21:29] are both the problems solved?
[21:33] now go, bring Rutba
[22:46] where were we?
[22:48] Sir, on the terrace
[22:52] the board is in front of you, focus on it
[22:54] we are studying here, not on the terrace
[22:58] Okay?
yes sir
[23:04] have you informed Rutba about the wedding?
[23:07] Not yet
[23:09] She is already afraid, and I don't want to scare her more by telling about the marriage
[23:14] let her come here once then
[23:16] She will only do, whatever we will ask her to do
[23:20] what if she refused at the eleventh hour, then?
[23:24] She will never do this
[23:27] she can never refuse my love
[23:35] dad, we don't have much time. Go, arrange a religious scholar
[23:39] Get the house decorated. I want to welcome my new bride in a beautiful manner
[23:46] everything will be done
[24:00] Altamash is not doing the right thing
[24:03] what is right for you?
[24:05] separation of brother Altamash and Rutba?
[24:09] I will show that to you
[24:15] brother Altamash loves Rutba
[24:18] why do you want to distance them? What will you get by doing it?
[24:22] I can never imagine of getting married to such a person
[24:25] who loves my sister
[24:29] Altamash doesn't love Rutba
[24:32] he loves her wealth
[24:36] Okay
[24:38] but what do you have?
[24:40] neither wealth nor love
[24:42] it would be better if you find someone else with love
[24:45] what is your problem?
[24:47] my problem is that I don't want to do anything bad with anyone
[24:50] I am not doing anything bad with anyone. I want my right
[24:53] Altamash is my childhood love
[24:55] I had considered him mine since I was a child
[24:58] he used to be my friend as well, he used to give me importance in everything
[25:01] then don't know how & when Rutba came in between us and took him away from me
[25:07] and I didn't get to know
[25:10] but now its my turn
[25:13] I will not snatch him
[25:15] I will bring him back
[25:18] do you hear me?
[25:20] never taunt me that I do bad with someone
[25:31] I've talked to Rutba & explained her everything
[25:34] she is ready
[25:37] are you guys ready?
[25:39] yes.. absolutely ready
[25:42] whatever we have to do now, is for your sake
[25:47] shall we go?
[26:25] What is the matter? You seem quite happy
[26:28] haven't you won any lottery?
[26:30] anyways, we came to meet Rutba & she is my friend Anaya
[26:36] Rutba is inside her room, you may go there to meet her
[26:39] thank you Khursheed!
[26:44] by the way, I know you have very strict responsibilities
[26:49] but don't worry, we won't take much time
[27:04] Please be quick before anyone comes
[27:17] where are you busy, uncle? Why aren't you seeing my message?
[27:21] uncle, please check the message
[27:32] No, not like this
[27:33] be quick!
[27:37] from the lands of Saeedpur, I have transferred 21 acres of land in the name of Khursheed Hasan
[27:45] So compete its documents
[27:48] Okay better
[27:50] Sir, you had forgotten your phone in the room. Its ringing again & again
[27:58] uncle, Altamash has called Rutba from your house
[28:03] both of them will get married tonight
[28:05] stop Rutba by every possible manner
[28:08] otherwise, both of them will shatter all of your dreams tonight
[28:12] I beg you uncle that my name shouldn't come in this matter
[28:45] Greetings uncle!
[28:48] Khursheed Hasan, where is Rutba?
[28:50] uncle, Rutba is inside her room as some of her friends are here
[28:53] Rutba has left the house
[28:55] you couldn't protect her
[28:57] Go after her! She has gone to Altamash's house
[28:59] they are getting married
[29:01] what!

[30:02] Lal Khan...

[30:05] yes sir!
[30:06] how many people came in, and how many went out?
[30:08] Sir, only maam Rutba's friends have gone out
[30:11] they were three girls
[30:12] if two girls came inside the house then how come three went out?
[30:14] oh sir!
quickly open the gate!
[30:31] All praise to God, may God bless you my dear
[30:39] you are looking so handsome. I wanted to see you in this attire
[30:42] may God bless him with good fate
[30:44] God willing! All praise to God my son is looking so dashing after becoming a groom
[30:50] oh my son! He isn't going to the bride's house for the marriage, instead he has called her to his house
[30:55] this is called manly gesture!
[30:57] why won't he go to the bride's house for the marriage?
[30:59] you'll see, I will do an extravagant wedding of my price in Mehr Ali house
[31:05] for now, we have to put a label on the girl. Also, we have to cut her wings!
[31:11] of the girls as well as of her father's
[31:15] the girls haven't come as of yet, its quite late now. I am getting worried
[31:23] greetings!

[32:09] I did so many calls, also sent him a lot of messages but..
[32:12] he isn't replying at all, I don't know why
[32:14] Altamash has switched off everyone's phone over here
[32:17] so that brother cannot talk to anyone
[32:20] you don't have to switch off your phone at any cost
[32:23] brother will contact you for sure
And listen!
[32:27] We have to stop this marriage at any cost

[32:44] how is this possible?
[32:45] Rutba, dear its our biggest compulsion
[32:50] its the only option to save your love & our honor
[32:53] brother is upset with Altamash & he wants to end this relation
[32:58] No, no.. he cannot do this
[33:01] dad knows that all of my happiness is associated with this relation. he will never do this
[33:06] dear, he is your father
[33:08] and he is so precious to you, that's why you think that he cannot think this way
[33:12] he is my elder brother, he is very precious to me as well
[33:15] but right now, I took a stand for the sake of my children happiness
[33:20] Rutba, if this wedding didn't happen right now then you'll lose Altamash's love for lifetime
[33:27] brother will end this relation as soon as he will come back from his lands
[33:30] but aunty, if this marriage happened today without dad's consent then he will kill me
