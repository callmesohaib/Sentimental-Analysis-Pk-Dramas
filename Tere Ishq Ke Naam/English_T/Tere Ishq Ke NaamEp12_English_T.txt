[00:14] we have already talked, mom
[00:16]  she had said that she accepts
[00:19] even I had said that I accept 
[00:22] what is left to say or hear after all this?
[00:27] the poet has said... 
[00:31] these lanterns doesn't have a light anymore
[00:32] brother, I have done exactly whatever you had asked me to do 
[00:37] they weren't agreeing at all
[00:41] and Altamash 
[00:44] he was adamant. He was saying that he will ensure to bring Rutba to his house by any means
[01:06] Sir
[01:08] Greetings!
[01:09] Greetings, how are you all?
[01:12] uncle, can we please meet Rutba?
[01:14] why not? 
Rasheeda, take them to Rutba
[01:17] also make an arrangement for their lunch, there shouldn't be anything missing
[01:20] they had paid a visit after so long
thank you!
[01:27] Rutba, we just got Azka & s wedding card. How did it happen?
[01:33] Altamash used to love you a lot, right? Also, he had married you
[01:38] then how come all of this?
[01:39] what is the scene? I don't get anything
[01:43] Azka is calling everyone, and insisting to attend her wedding. 
[01:48] but you didn't even inform us about your second marriage
[01:51] whom you have got married to?
[01:52] I know with whom Rutba has got married 
[01:57] Rutba's cousin, her aunt's son "Khursheed"
[02:00] the same, "Sheeda"
[02:05] oh no!
[02:08] really!
[02:11] wait a minute! He is the same guy right who used to give you pick & drop?
[02:15] He was just like your servant
[02:18] but Rutba, why did your father married you to Khursheed after getting you divorced from Altamash?
[02:24] he has done such a big oppression on you
[02:41] my dear child... 
[02:43] Khursheed Hasan is my son & Rutba's husband
[02:48] brother Mehr Ali considers him like his son
[02:52] he did top in his university
[02:55] and he is teaching the girls like you in Hasanabad college
[03:02] Khursheed Hasan is my son and I am proud of him!
[03:06] remember one thing
[03:09] Wealth epitomizes pharaoh, wisdom is the bequeathed of saints
[03:15] And Rutba is very fortunate
[03:19] that she got a life partner like Khursheed
[03:31] you are very happy dad, you think that you have won this battle
[03:36] Rutba has become a slave & Altamash's chapter is closed now
[03:40] No dad!
[03:42] this happiness doesn't suits you after snatching my smile
[03:46] since you are Mehr Ali Khan, so I am also Rutba Mehr Ali Khan 
[03:50] Khursheed can never win me
[03:53] Never!
[04:16] you may go
[04:17] Rasheeda, no matter how much I explain to you. Still you do everything on your own
[04:23] and you are always busy in serving others
[04:28] brother, I have got no purpose of my life
[04:31] Khursheed has also gone, and my time doesn't pass
[04:36] this house is lively because of you, and you are stopping me do the work
[04:44] oh! Rasheeda, from where the sun has rise today?
[04:51] Greetings!*
[04:55] Rutba, shall I make tea for you?
[04:57] No, I will make it myself
[05:01] Rutba, you haven't gone out since so long
[05:05] go out, do some outing... make some program
[05:09] yes... I will go
[05:13] do take the money with you
[05:15] No... I don't want anything
[05:20] I forgot to tell you that I am getting your room's renovation 
[05:26] it will look really good then
[05:28] I will arrange a big party in our house upon Khursheed's arrival for their departure ceremony
[05:36] Khursheed will live here with us in this house now
[05:39] in fact, it would be better to say that you will live with Khursheed over here
[05:44] I will live with Khursheed
[05:48] but not in your luxurious house
[05:52] in fact, in the small house that Khursheed has got
[05:57] which is quite far from here
[06:00] I've decided
[06:10] I am going from here
[06:13] for forever.. 
[06:38] you want to give me false happiness like broken toys of mud, dad
[06:44] and you think that Rutba will make the basis of her life with them
[06:49] I will burn down your broken & shattered happiness once & for all
[06:55] shopping, outings, big parties, gifts & social gatherings
[07:00] now such things doesn't hold any value in front of me
[07:06] that Rutba has died who used to get entertained by these toys
[07:10] but you feel peaceful to see this walking corpse in this house, right?
[07:15] so, I will also snatch away this peace from you 
[07:18] the way you have snatched everything from me
[07:22] now think that you have buried me in the coffin namely Khursheed
[09:05] yes madam, where do you want to go?
[09:06] sit inside the car, I will tell you
[09:43] how can she leave without my permission?
[09:46] why you didn't ask me?
[09:49] what I could do, sir?
[09:51] She had stopped the car on the bus station without saying anything, and sat in the bus
[09:57] all of this had happened all of a sudden, that I couldn't do anything
[10:01] my daughter had gone in the bus?
[10:05] So, have I kept so many cars to use in the hell?
[10:10] go
[10:23] her phone is switched off
[10:26] brother, where can Rutba go?
[10:31] She must have gone to Hasanabad
[10:39] how do you feel living here?
[10:41] I am feeling good, as I am experiencing the clean air for the very first time
[10:46] and then, the people of this place are very nice just like its environment
[10:50] simple & hospitable
[10:53] absolutely correct!
[10:55] Its been almost a year that I came here from Hyderabad, I really don't feel like going back
[11:00] so why don't you call your family here?
[11:03] I mean, its better than staying alone
[11:07] who is left in my family now
[11:10] its been so many years to my parents demise
[11:13] my brother & his wife both are in the army, therefore they wander round in different cities
[11:18] now its just me & my books in the family. So its going pretty well
[11:26] and... you?
[11:29] why don't you call your family?
[11:32] I mean, who else is there in your house?
[11:40] only mother
[11:41] then call her over here
[11:44] I mean, she must be missing you over there all alone
[11:49] maybe, she had chosen a girl for you of her choice
[11:56] because looking at you, one can get an idea that... 
[12:02] you will like the girl of your mother's choice
[12:05] really!
[12:07] its true, right?
[12:10] See, the actual question is. Will the girl of my mother's choice like me?
[12:17] lets find out the answer of this question until evening tea
[12:22] I've heard that a setting sun gives a lot of hint
[12:38] alright let me prepare an evening tea, then you can come & get it
[12:42] Alright, I will see you in the evening... 
[13:21] who is she?
[13:29] Ms. Tazmeen, we'll meet in the evening
[13:34] better
[13:36] bye!
[13:57] how did you came here?
[13:59] in the bus
[14:02] now don't ask that why I came here
[14:10] why I shouldn't ask?
[14:14] because you don't have the right
[14:18] Oh!
[14:23] come
[15:11] did you came here after informing at home?
[15:29] I didn't find it important
[15:32] a person who has accepted a death sentence by its own consent
[15:38] then he goes to the same place where there are gallows
[15:51] Fine!
[15:56] but here, you don't take life but give life
[16:02] whether you live here like a calamity or a spirit, its your choice
[16:07] I will take 15 minutes to freshen up, then I will make arrangements for lunch
[16:18] you must be feeling hungry
[17:49] yes Khursheed, I knew it that she must have gone to Hasanabad
[17:54] but...  is everything fine?
[17:57] yes, everything is fine uncle. Don't worry
[18:01] Ok listen, do let me know if you need the money
[18:04] No uncle, I have
[18:07] but still ... 
[18:09] Ok, how is mom?
[18:12] I hope she isn't feeling very sad without me
[18:15] you are her child, so getting upset is natural
[18:17] but don't worry, she is fine
[18:21] even if she is upset, still she doesn't express it
[18:24] Okay, talk to her
[18:31] hello! how is my son?
[18:34] greetings mom!
[18:36] greetings!
[18:37] I'm just like that person who has been blessed by her mother
[18:41] how are you?
[18:43] Okay don't be upset without me, otherwise I won't be able to focus here
[18:47] why you won't be able to focus now? now your bride has reached to you
[18:53] you have to focus now
[18:58] Okay mom, I'll talk to you later as I am busy right now
[19:04] Okay fine, stay happy & blessed
[19:08] Bye!
bye!
[19:12] let me bring tea for you
[20:29] Rutba, I have brought lunch for you
[21:09] keep all of your things outside with you
[21:12] I will not open the door for you daily, so that you can come in & get your things
[21:17] neither I was snoring like you the entire night
[21:20] just a while ago I had slept, and here you are asking for your things
[21:27] a peaceful sleep is also a blessing, not everyone can enjoy it
[21:31] but yes the sleep of negligence is a torment
[21:42] tell aunt & Azka that I don't want any pageantry
[21:46] the way wedding ceremony was done, the same way departure ceremony will happen
[21:50] I had told her
[21:53] Ronaq had mind it a lot
[21:56] she said, its Altamash's second wedding but Azka's first wedding
[22:05] Great!
[22:07] it means, according to your sister its Altamash's second marriage
[22:12] by the way your sister is very clever
[22:16] yes!
[22:18] because she has our brother's support
[22:21] until yesterday, her tongue doesn't used to get tired while pronouncing sister at all times
[22:25] but her attitude got completely changed after getting Saeedpur land
[22:30] clearly tell Azka, those lands will be transferred in my name
[22:33] if she tried to show any slyness then her condition will be same as Rutba's
[22:37] Quiet! stupid.. 
[22:44] we haven't come out of one drama as of yet, and you have started to show the stupidity for another?
[22:50] stupid! Such matters aren't handled forcefully but with love & care
[22:58] Rutba had her father's support, but there is no one behind Azka
[23:02] but she will back out for sure because of this attitude of yours, and then you will get nothing!
[23:09] your mother is absolutely correct
[23:12] keep your senses strong, with calm state of mind
[23:18] besides, a woman is quite a difficult thing
[23:23] she thinks of herself something big if she gets some money
[23:30] learn to become an archer instead of an arrow
[23:36] then only you can hit the target, got it?
[23:45] what is the need to make Azka realize that you are still mourning for Rutba?
[23:50] She wants to be happy, support her the most in celebrating
[24:12] she will definitely celebrate, mom
[24:15] because according to her, she has won a very big battle
[24:19] the property of Saeedpur, as well as Altamash's companionship
[24:23] she had wanted all of this
[24:25] since childhood, the poor girl was already into my love & jealousy with Rutba
[24:32] but Altamash
[24:35] Altamash follows the path as per his calculations
[24:39] and there is no forgiveness in Altamash's diary for a deceitful & disloyal person
[25:47] Khursheed
[25:50] what is this drama?
[25:52] what drama? This is the beginning
[25:55] look, this is the stove, pan, plier, flour.. spices
[26:03] what shall I do?
[26:05] are you telling me all of this so that I shall prepare the food & serve you?
[26:13] I've been seeing you since childhood
[26:16] you had never stepped inside the kitchen in your own house
[26:18] then how can I think that you will work here?
[26:22] I am having a severe headache, and here you are making so much of noise
[26:28] make me a cup of tea, and it should be piping hot
[26:45] very nice, uncle!
[26:48] how will I return this favor of your love?
[27:23] Greetings!*
[27:26] I am Tazmeen Ansari
[27:28] Okay
[27:30] is Mr. Khursheed home? I have brought rice for you guys
[27:46] where is Mr. Khursheed?
[28:10] oh Ms. Tazmeen, you here?
[28:14] I had made rice for you, I thought since you have guests at home so...
[28:21] actually I make really good rice
[28:24] thank you!
one second...
[28:27] give it to me
[28:29] thank you! Please come, sit... the tea is almost ready
[28:32] No no, please. I have to prepare morning lecture & you seem quite busy today
[28:41] I thought of setting the kitchen
[28:43] its such a good thing.
Alright then, shall I leave now?
[28:47] Come, let me see you off. One second
[28:50] Please come
[28:51] Good bye!
[30:08] Rutba
[30:14] Rutba
[30:20] one minute!
[30:23] Rutba
[30:45] what happen?
[30:47] I have to go to the college & my things are lying inside
[31:15] keep all of your things outside with you
[31:17] I will not open the door for you daily, so that you can come in & get your things
[31:22] neither I was snoring like you the entire night
[31:25] just a while ago I had slept, and here you are asking for your things
[31:32] a peaceful sleep is also a blessing, not everyone can enjoy it
[31:36] but yes the sleep of negligence is a torment
[31:39] one should seek protection from it
[31:42] for now I want to get rid of you
[31:45] I am very hungry so make breakfast as I haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[31:51] let me take a shower until then
[32:55] is the payment done by this party?
[32:59] we have received the payment, and I have updated it
[33:04] what about this payment?
[33:05] we will get it by today
[33:11] Okay, we'll check rest of the accounts later. You may go
[33:17] hello! yes Azka
[33:20] Altamash, my wedding dress is so pretty
[33:25] thank you!
[33:28] I have to see that how will you look in it
[33:31] the time will tell you that how will I look
[33:37] what shall I tell you, Altamash
[33:40] how happy I am
I had waited for this day so eagerly
[33:45] there is no need to say anything, Azka
[33:48] why?
[33:50] you should know that a girl you are marrying is not an ordinary girl
[33:57] my love is special
[33:59] that's why I am also special
[34:03] Rutba couldn't get you
[34:06] but I got you
[34:09] and now you have to be mine always
[34:15] Altamash
[34:18] are you also eagerly waiting for the upcoming days, the way I am?
[34:24] Azka, you have got whatever you wanted
[34:27] but what I want, I am still waiting for it
[34:31]  time will tell us that who will win & loose in this game of getting & loosing
[35:13] everyone's happiness & benefits are associated with this relation
[35:20] except me 
[35:23] what do you think?
[35:24] that I will agree to marry an ordinary person like you
[35:30] I will choose you as my life partner 
[35:32] I have just chosen you as my coffin
[35:42] you also listen to me, dad 
[35:44] you really wanted to see your daughter's corpse hanging on your decision's gallows
[35:50] its fine then 
[35:53] now you will not see your daughter but a corpse
[36:03] I will live with Khursheed
[36:06] but not in your luxurious house
[36:10] in fact, in the small house that Khursheed has got
[36:13] which is quite far from here
[36:16] I've decided
[36:18] I am going from here
for forever..
[36:39] I hope I don't get late for the class today
[36:48] what is this behavior?
[36:51] I took a shower with cold water
[36:54] yes so?
[36:56] I am not habitual of taking a bath with cold water
[37:00] I fall sick
[37:05] we don't have geyser here, if you want hot water then go & get it from the kitchen
[37:11] my childhood was spent in front of you, right?
[37:14] have you ever seen me doing this sort of work?
[37:19] you know this is not Mehr Ali house, right?
[37:30] you knew it that I am Rutba Mehr Ali before marrying me, right?
[37:36] you have read so many books
[37:39] what does a girl deserves who had been living in a luxurious lifestyle
[37:45] you must be aware of a wife's rights
[37:47] yes absolutely!
[37:49] by the way, I am also aware of the husband's rights
[38:03] I've kept the breakfast on the table, do it
[38:05] otherwise I have to listen to the complaint of cold breakfast like you did of cold water
