[00:14] What? 
[00:16] May God forgive her sins. 
[00:20] Alright.
[00:22] What happened? 
[00:24] Rutbah's aunt Ronaq has passed away. 
[00:27] The poor woman was caught in a fire...
[00:40] Why would she need someone's sympathy now? 
[00:44] Arfa is absolutely correct, mom
[00:49] One should sympathize with who is worthy of it. 
[00:53] There is no point in sympathizing with a murderer.
[00:56] I'm telling you guys...
[00:59] I will divorce Aska after forty days of aunt's demise
[01:02] Altamash! Control yourself
this is not the right time to say such things
[01:08] even your aunt's shroud is still fresh
[01:11] mom, if one's heart becomes sour from someone then the person doesn't see the time nor situation
[01:20] and if your heart becomes sour from someone then its difficult to see that person's face!
[01:24] now she looks towards me in a begging way of mercy that I shall go & console her
[01:31] why shall I console her?
[01:34] because she has killed my son, that's why?
[01:36] she had burnt the property document, that's why? Or she has killed her mother, that's why!
[01:48] No mom
[01:50] we can never show sympathy towards a murderer
[01:57] I'm telling you people, soon I will divorce Azka
[02:10] Rutba & Khursheed's marriage related matters will be solved soon and... 
[02:14] I will marry Rutba
[04:33] Khan uncle, quickly keep mom's luggage inside
[04:36] Okay sir
[04:44] Khurhseed, won't you come inside with me?
[04:48] won't you meet Rutba before going?
[04:51] mom, very less time is left in my flight therefore I cannot stay. 
[04:53] Whatever work is left now, I will do it after coming back
[04:57] Ok listen... 
[05:02] give it to Rutba
[05:03] what is this?
[05:05] mom, do give it to her. Its her mandate
[05:08] what do you mean?
[05:09] She will explain you everything. 
[05:10] Already she knows the meaning of everything, she will explain this too. Take it
[05:53] aunty... 
[05:58] you did very well by coming here
[06:01] I was so upset that its difficult to express in words
[06:08] I can understand my dear
[06:10] first your father's demise... 
[06:14] then your aunt's demise... 
[06:19] I am so sorry, that's why I came back quickly
[06:24] You did very well. With whom you came?
[06:30] with Khursheed
[06:33] he didn't come inside?
[06:37] No dear
[06:39] he was saying that he'll miss his flight, that's why he has left
[06:46] He gave your mandate
[06:49] my mandate?
[06:51] yes dear, keep it
[08:14] All the doors between us are locked forever.
[08:19] I don't need an explanation from you.
[08:23]  I don't have any complaints against you.
[08:27] I have complaints against my heart. 
[08:45] Dead people can't talk.
[08:49] You will get your last possession.
[08:55] Be happy.
[09:06] what have you done, Khursheed Hasan?
[09:10] how will I face my father now?
[09:14] you had promised him that you will never leave his Rutba 
[09:21] you will always stay by her side
[09:24] then why?
[09:26] why did you broke your promise, Khursheed?
[09:29] why so?
[11:16] you... 
[11:21] are you leaving?
[11:28] yes, I am going back
[11:32] I won't ever come back
[11:38] I am not taking my share of inhertinece as well
[11:41] whatever mom had, you can keep it
[11:48] No Arfa... 
[11:51] keep your share of inheritance
[11:55] in fact, keep mine as well
[12:01] but don't show aloofness with me
[12:07] whom do I have except for you
[12:16] show some pity on me
[12:22] my loneliness will kill me
[12:26] Altamash didn't even ask one time that how am I doing
[12:30] neither uncle nor aunty, nobody had asked me that how am I doing
[12:38] I have nobody left
[12:44] look at this... 
[12:47] I am already dying on daily basis because of my sins
[12:55] but I will die right away because of the aloofness of my loved ones
[13:03] Azka, you never used to understand such things earlier
[13:12] but time has explained you everything in a single moment
[13:21] hatred, stubbornness, cheating... 
[13:25] all of them had closed the doors of thought process
[13:29] and a tight slap of time opens all the closed doors
[13:36] tell me, what can I do for you?
[13:52] Tell him not to leave me
[14:01] Please tell Altamash, not to divorce me
[14:06] where will I go Arfa, if he will leave me as well?
[14:12] where will I go?
[14:18] Please ask him not to leave me
[15:04] she will die
[15:07] when a person becomes so empty & meaningless from within, 
[15:13] then its difficult to survive for long time
[15:16] a person decides its own path & ways of living, Arfa
[15:23] the path that both of them had chosen
[15:26] maybe this was its end result
[15:37] Rutba, is it true that you & Khursheed don't have any relation anymore?
[15:48] I didn't expected this from Khursheed
[15:56] there isn't any fault of Khursheed in all this
[16:05] You are Mehr Ali Khan's daughter... 
[16:09] who never badmouths about their enemy as well
[16:21] Is Altamash & you getting married in real?
[16:31] I don't believe on Altamash's words at all
[16:37] Arfa, I have seen so many things in my life on which I had firm belief
[16:48] but they were proved to be wrong one after another
[16:58] I've seen impossible becoming possible
[17:07] you also don't believe on impossible
[17:12] Rutba I... 
[17:15] I won't tell you not to marry Altamash
[17:19] I know that both of you used to love each other
[17:24] but you guys got separated because of my mother & Azka
[17:32] but I am here to make a request to you
[17:36] I beg you... 
[17:43] Please tell Altamash, not to divorce Azka
[17:50] he can leave her in some corner like a useless thing
[17:56] at least this way she'll stay alive
[19:06] now whether you consider yourself as the guest or an animal in this house
[19:12] its your choice
[19:16] Altamash, at least finish your breakfast. 
Where are you going?
[19:20] I am already done
[19:23] I am going to Rutba
[19:25] I will ensure to fix the wedding date today
[19:37] Rutba, heartiest congratulations to you. 
[19:39] Today on wards they have started the work for the construction of he school
[19:43] Also, I have distributed the sweets in the entire village
[19:47] All praise to God
[19:50] aunty, heartiest congratulations to you too
[19:56] I can't tell you how happy I am today
[20:01] I am sure that my father must be very happy as well
[20:06] why not dear?
 A good & a pious child is a ceaseless charity
[20:12] and your every good deed will reach to your father for sure
[20:21] aunty, my exams are nearby
[20:27] I will come to you as soon as they will get over
[20:31] I will wait for you my dear
[20:35] farewell*
[26:36] Azka, how many times I have told you not to come in front of me early in the morning
[26:40] my entire day gets ruined when I see your face
[26:47] what is the problem?
[26:50] until when I will stay in this house as an uninvited guest?
[26:58] nobody even treats an animal in this manner
[27:04] so who has compelled you to stay in this house?
[27:08] We gave you a space in this house upon Rutba's request
[27:14] also I took out a space in my life
[27:17] but I cannot give you a space in my heart
[27:31] now whether you consider yourself as the guest or an animal in this house
[27:36] its your choice
[27:41] Altamash, at least finish your breakfast. 
Where are you going?
[27:44] I am already done
[27:47] I am going to Rutba
[27:50] I will ensure to fix the wedding date today
[28:12] wait a minute, Altamash
[28:16] See... 
[28:18] we haven't faced too many hardships just to form yours & Rutba's relation
[28:26] even today, everything is way too far from our hands like it was in Mehr Ali Khan's life
[28:35] in fact now Rutba is playing more cleverly than her father
[28:45] we haven't got anything as of yet
[28:48] instead a lot of our things have been transferred on her name
[28:51] where will we she take everything?
[28:54] Khursheed has left her
[28:57] she has completed her iddat (waiting period after divorce)
[29:02] if something is left with her, then its only Altamash
[29:12] and Altamash is going to get her Rutba
[30:18] no matter how beautiful the world is abroad
[30:22] but the satisfaction of coming back home is way too different
[30:25] absolutely correct!
[30:27] I feel so relaxed after seeing all these green fields & farms
[30:32] I feel like stopping the car & running towards those streams of water
[30:38] and to breathe in this open air. I want to feel how lovely it is
[30:46] that's it? such a small wish?
[30:52] uncle, stop the car
[30:55] Khursheed
[30:57] I can do this much for you
[30:59] lets go!
[32:53] Rutba
[32:56] nobody must have waited for anyone the way I had waited for you
[33:01] be mine now, don't test my patience otherwise I will do something wrong
[33:09] So, this is your last decision
[33:12] that you want to come to Mehr Ali house once again to marry me?
[33:18] what's the point of discussing these things now?
[33:21] The point is that Azka is in your house, she is in your life
[33:28] If you want, you can spend a happily married life with her
[33:36] you are insulting my feelings
[33:40] feelings?
[33:43] do you even know its meaning?
[33:47] I'm not that illiterate!
[33:51] that's why a lot of men stay away from an educated women
[33:56] because they give lectures of wisdom on every thing
[34:00] not every man stay away from an educated woman
[34:10] Okay Rutba leave it, what are we discussing... 
[34:16] we came here to talk about the wedding. Tell me when shall I come for the wedding ceremony?
[34:22] if you have already decided
[34:27] then I also don't have any objection
[34:33] it will be the happiest day of my life
[34:38] when you will come to Mehr Ali house to marry me
[34:44] really?
[34:46] I will go & tell this to my mom, she will be so happy
[34:51] we'll come to your house for the wedding ceremony
[34:55] do bring along Azka too
[34:58] I want her to see.... 
[35:02] those wishing ill don't matter
 it is God's will that prevails
[35:11] by the way, you are becoming like Altamash
[35:50] Really! Thanks to God. No Matter how much I thank God is less
[35:56] I was waiting for this moment for so long
[35:59] did you see, Bazil Khan. Our son is a lion. A lion!
[36:09] how slowly & gradually he has removed each & every obstacle from his way
[36:15] just wait for a few more days
[36:21] then Mehr Ali Khan's everything will be ours
[36:31] Yes Altmash! Ask Azka to return all the gold that we've given her on the wedding
[36:43] after all, we are going to marry Rutba
[36:46] and no matter how much the gold is, its always less
[36:50] Besides, this gold isn't of her use anymore
[36:56] only that woman is the bride, whom her husband loves
[37:00] Its enough for her that we've allowed her to stay in this house
