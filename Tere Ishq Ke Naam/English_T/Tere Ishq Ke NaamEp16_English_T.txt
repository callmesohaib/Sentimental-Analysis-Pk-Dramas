[00:14] Rasheeda, when the day is spent with harsh realities 
[00:18] then the nights are spend in the same manner
[00:22] even if I lie down on the bed, still I won't feel sleepy
[00:29] the sleeping pills are very cheap in price, Rasheeda 
[00:32] but... a peaceful sleep is a very precious thing
[01:11] Khursheed
[01:18] the seedbed of every relation is not the same
[01:21] somewhere the land is soft, and somewhere its hard
[01:26] only those people become successful who doesn't give up
[01:31] every relation is not like a rose or jasmine
[01:34] the seedbeds which are barren, are full of pricks
[01:38] don't be upset, Khursheed
[01:41] you came back after so many days
[01:43] you mother only want to see you smiling face
[01:51] and presently, I also need my mother only
[01:54] when the life's important matters are on one's head, then one needs to become a man
[02:00] and a man is full of courage
[02:05] dear forgive me, maybe I have said a lot
[02:08] No uncle, I won't complain even if you will beat me
[02:13] but don't hurt me by saying such things
[02:16] Rasheeda, the children came home after so many days. So nothing shall be missing in their room
[02:23] yes brother, don't worry. Let me see
[02:28] and Khursheed
[02:30] I hadn't asked you to enter your name on the papers in the section of Rutba's husband
[02:39] you have right on Rutba
[02:42] and same goes with Rutba
[02:44] and I don't feel happy to see the righteous person so weak
[02:52] if I can scold you on your careless attitude towards your responsibilities
[02:57] then I can also question Rutba on her carelessness & misbehavior
[03:03] I feel so hurt to see you both like this
[03:08] remember one thing, Khursheed
[03:11] a man can win every war with love & tolerance
[03:20] Go, take some rest as you must be tired
[03:25] smile, stay happy
[04:03] what did my father said to you?
[04:09] he gave me a new mission
[04:15] what do you mean?
[04:20] means, first he wants me to win his princess heart
[04:25] also, I shall remove her pain & sorrows
[04:31] but he doesn't know that sometimes a victory is more painful that defeat
[04:37] Khursheed, I just had signatures for you
[04:42] that's it!
[04:45] Rutba, you came here in anger without informing me
[04:49] and I was held responsible for it
[04:53] and then as a punishment I was told to win your heart first & then to celebrate about it
[05:01] you can break me on the basis of power
[05:06] but your ego & self-respect will be completely shattered
[05:17] remember Khursheed
[05:21] the woman whose heart you cannot win
[05:26] by winning her existence, you won't get anything except for disappointment & guilt
[05:37] understand?
[05:47] listen
[05:54] whatever we have discussed 
[05:59] its good if it stays here, between us
[06:06] because you are nothing in front of me
[06:13] but outside, for everyone you hold a big status
[06:22] it these matters will stay here
[06:25] then your respect will stay intact more than mine
[07:00] Khursheed
[07:01] yes
[07:06] dear, brother has forbidden to open the quarter
[07:10] so why you came here?
[07:13] mom, the things look good at their place
[07:23] you shouldn't be upset on brother's scolding
[07:27] brother is already so worried
[07:30] Rutba has worried him mentally by coming here all of a sudden like this
[07:37] for now he cannot decide that who is right or wrong
[07:45] why uncle is worried?
[07:49] dear, freshen up & have dinner then we'll talk
[07:57] I am not hungry, just bring tea
[08:09] what kind of a relation you have made brother?
[08:12] my son has become completely shattered
[08:27] what do you think of me, Altamash?
[08:30] you think that Azka is some ordinary thing on your way
[08:34] and you got her just like that
[08:37] I will tell you what I am
[08:39] one day, your pride will be ruined
[08:43] I will make you fall miserably
[09:15] I know you were so close to Rutba
[09:20] but you can never fulfill her absence by staying away from me
[09:29] you love me a lot, right?
[09:36] Rutba used to say the same thing
[09:40] that's why she had gone from my life
[09:44] I will do everything for you that you want
[09:47] We will stay very happy together
[09:51] then nobody will be able to come between us
[09:56] even I want the same, Azka
[09:59] that we shall never fight
[10:03] I hope that you'll prove to be a good wife
[10:10] and a good wife considers her husband everything
[10:15] she loves him more than everything
[10:20] Altamash, what had you discussed with uncle in private?
[10:23] can I know that?
[10:25] its a men talk
[10:28] let it stay between men
[10:34] what is your concern in it, Azka?
[10:38] he had dropped you here
[10:42] I have fulfilled his wish
[10:47] its your turn now
[10:53] uncle is quite intelligent, Altamash
[10:56] he knows it very well that how, when & where he needs to deal someone
[11:04] right?
[11:08] yes absolutely!
[11:10] and I am also my uncle's nephew
[12:38] hello!
[12:40] hello! Khursheed, you will not tell my dad that we spend our lives separately
[12:46] Okay, anything else?
[12:50] also, you will not tell him about Altamash
[12:55] keep your delusions limited to yourself
[13:03] what happened? Are you listening to what I am saying?
[13:06] I am listening, Rutba
[13:09] sometimes painful words also gives happiness
[13:14] I feel happy to know that you care for your father
[13:19] and your self respect
[13:24] which I hadn't expected from you
[13:56] here you go
[14:03] pour the tea
[14:09] Rasheeda, Rutba & Khursheed are still asleep?
[14:20] greetings dad!
[14:21] greetings! come dear sit
[14:35] last night I had slept very peacefully
[14:39] where is Khrsheed, Rutba?
[14:50] yes? Rutba?
[14:56] dad...
greetings uncle!
[14:59] greetings! come dear sit
[15:10] today the taste of the breakfast will be really good
[15:18] right Rasheeda?
[15:21] absolutely correct, brother
[15:23] today it seems that our house is filled with the lights, and the happiness has returned
[15:28] and the most important thing is that you seem quite happy & healthy
[15:38] yes Rasheeda, happiness, colors... life
[15:45] its all because of them in my life
[15:52] lands, wealth & properties becomes the reason behind a person's mental worries
[16:04] Rasheeda look, today I consider myself as the most richest person on this earth
[16:13] my children are with me, what else do I need from life? 
nothing!
[16:19] yes
[16:25] Khursheed, how do you find your room?
[16:35] I have ordered everything new
[16:38] I want you both to live properly whenever you visit
[16:42] did you find it good?
[16:44] uncle, everything is very nice. But your love is more important for me than all these things
[16:56] Khursheed listen, your are more precious to me than a son
[17:03] I don't know that why Rutba came here, after fighting upon which matter but..
[17:14] but the way you came after her immediately
[17:19] proves that you care for her and...
[17:24] you also care about your relation
[17:33] its your biggest quality to fulfill every relation with complete honesty
[17:43] dear, I did injustice to you for the sake of my daughter's happiness & satisfaction
[17:50] whatever I had said, you didn't deserve it
[17:59] Khursheed, her love has made me selfish
[18:09] I would like to apologize to you
[18:13] No uncle, please there isn't any such thing
[18:17] your apology will hurt me more than your scoldings
[18:21] today, whatever I am is because of you. You have done so many favors on me
[18:26] and nothing is more important for me than your happiness, life & health
[18:37] I can tolerate anything for you uncle
there isn't any such thing
[18:41] please don't say like this
[18:46] stay blessed, dear
[19:09] travel safe, dear
May God keep you in his protection
[19:12] don't worry about me, mom
I know how to stay happy
[19:18] I don't like to send you alone Khursheed but...
[19:22] uncle, why are you worrying? Loneliness is my companion since childhood
[19:27] and.. I think Rutba shall stay wherever she feels happy
[19:33] why loneliness?
[19:36] a lot of your colleagues are there to share your loneliness
[19:40] am I right?
[19:47] Rutba, uncle had said to me that its my biggest quality to fulfill the relations with complete honesty
[19:56] I completely believe on my quality and on uncle's words
[20:01] See you again
[20:03] Bye!
[20:04] bye dear
[20:31] her eyes were stoned after meeting me
[20:36] only I can put life in those eyes
[20:43] the last turn is left in this game
[20:47] once uncle's queen is gone
[20:50] the game will be changed
[21:20] you didn't even think before hurting Rutba, that she is my life
[21:25] you taunt her
[21:28]  I hadn't hand over her to you for this
[21:32] also, not for this that you shall ignore her & find your happiness somewhere else
[21:55] Khursheed, how do you find your room?
I have ordered everything new
[22:00] I want you both to live properly whenever you visit
[22:04] everything is very nice. But your love is more important for me than all these things
[23:02] Rasheeda, what are you doing here?
[23:07] actually...
[23:09] here...
[23:14] who had stayed here?
[23:18] Khursheed
[23:21] oh!
[23:24] so this is the matter
[23:26] this is the reality, brother
[23:30] my son has high self respect, also he has a lot of patience
[23:37] he doesn't want to hurt you by saying anything
[23:42] he left from here while tolerating all the pain within himself
[23:49] Rutba doesn't consider him capable enough for her room
[23:53] how will she consider him capable though
[24:00] brother, how will they spend their life like this?
[24:30] dad, where are you going?
[24:34] I am going to the lawyer, as I have to get a few important documents signed
[24:40] I want to discuss something with you
[24:44] even I want to discuss something with you, see you in the evening
[26:54] seeing you after so long, it feels as if I am seeing you after so many years
[27:01] how are you, Rutba?
[27:07] not time but distance matters between two people
[27:14] however I am
[27:17] I am very far from you
[27:22] the way society distances someone, the same way it unites them
[27:28] emotions also lost their way, like humans do
[27:34] a man is already emotionally weak
[27:38] a woman has to be gracious
[27:45] I hope that Azka must be gracious
[27:50] her trial is still left
[27:54] you tell me
[27:56] Khursheed aka Sheeda has become completely disappointed or his hopes are still high?
[28:06] what do you mean?
 I didn't get it
[28:12] I feel so happy to see you here, in this house
[28:17] you..
[28:19] you are born to live in a palace like house
[28:25] not for the small house of Hasanabad and...
[28:29] to live with an ordinary guy like Khursheed
[28:34] dear Altamash, if you had been capable enough then you wouldn't have been standing in front of Rutba like this
[28:40] the fate has explained it very well that who is capable for what & what not
[28:47] I don't find it necessary to talk to everyone. Tell uncle that Altamash is here
[28:51] that's what I am sorry about, that brother Mehr is not at home
[28:55] otherwise, he would have told you for sure that to whom you can talk & with whom you cannot talk
[29:02] Soon I will tell everyone that Altamash listens to his heart & does whatever it says
[29:08] whomsoever he wants to get close with, he ensures to do that
[29:14] no matter if that person wants to become close or not
[29:22] tell uncle that Altamash had come
[29:56] you can break me on the basis of power
[29:59] but your ego & self-respect will be completely shattered
[30:05] the woman whose heart you cannot win
[30:08] by winning her existence, you won't get anything except for disappointment & guilt
[30:15] is everything fine Mr. Khursheed? You seem quite upset
[30:19] We heard that your wife has gone to her parents house
[30:22] that's why he is not going home, and sitting here with long face
[30:24] Ms. Tazmeen didn't came to college today, is everything fine?
[30:28] really! I don't know why she did an off today
[30:32] great! even the neighbors are unaware
[30:36] Mr. Khursheed, you've been so upset on your wife's departure that you've lost your senses
[30:41] see you then
[31:53] greetings brother, how are you?
[31:55] how are you? How are you feeling now?
[31:58] did your fever reduced or not?
[31:59] yes yes, thanks to God I am fine now
[32:07] it doesn't seem so that you are fine, did you see a doctor?
[32:11] I will try to go today
[32:14] see, I stay so worried for you. Try to consult a doctor
[32:19] you are living so far & that too all alone. I stay worried for you
[32:24] don't worry about me, I am absolutely fine here
[32:28] I am happy, its just that I got some fever. It will be fine
[32:34] Enough is enough! Get married, until when you'll spend your life alone?
[32:45] Okay brother, somebody is there on the door. I'll call you back, bye!
[33:07] Greetings!*
[33:10] since you didn't come to college today, so I thought to ask about your well being
[33:18] what happened, why are you crying? Is everything alright?
[33:23] I am not feeling well
[33:26] the fever isn't reducing, I have been suffering with a very high grade fever since last night
[33:32] Can I do something for you?
[33:35] Please call Ms. Azra, I will go to the doctor with her
[33:39] yes, sure. Please sit, let me call her in just two minutes
[34:09] Greetings!*
[34:26] thank God that I saw your smiling face
[34:30] I was yearning to see this smiling face of yours
[34:38] he will smile
[34:40] he will smile for sure
[34:43] he is Altmash
[34:45] Bazil Khan's son, not an ordinary guy
[34:52] have you brought the factory documents from Mehr Ali Khan?
[34:58] we'll get the documents too
[35:01] also the factory & lands will be transferred in my name
[35:05] presently, I got this smile from someone else's face
[35:09] really! great..
[35:13] what did Mehr Ali said?
[35:16] I couldn't meet uncle
but... I met Rutba
[35:25] Rutba? Where did you met her?
[35:29] inside Mehr Ali house?
[35:31] how is she?
[35:32] more beautiful than before
[35:35] more attractive than earlier
[35:39] what kind of a thing separation is
[35:42] a person forgets everything when the person he loves the most comes in front of him
[35:50] he remembers only one question
[35:57] Rutba, when will I meet you?
[35:59] when will I be able to get you?
[36:03] the only desire to meet her, nothing else
[36:09] Altamash, don't be crazy!
[36:12] if brother gets a bit of a hint then..
[36:15] then?
[36:17] then what?
[36:19] then a storm will come that will wash away everything along with it
[36:24] he won't take much time to kill you
[36:32] mom, if anything will wash away in this storm then it will be only uncle's pride
[36:38] you haven't met Rutba, right?
[36:40] but I met her
[36:44] her eyes were stoned after meeting me
[36:49] only I can put life in those eyes
[36:55] the last turn is left in this game
[36:59] once uncle's queen is gone
[37:02] the game will be changed
[37:04] Altamash!
[37:08] have you thought about Azka, what about her?
[37:11] its been just a few days that you guys got married
[37:13] I haven't thought
[37:15] neither I am interested in thinking about it
[37:19] you think about her, mom
[37:26] Bazil, did you see?
[37:29] what is all this happening?
[37:36] only one player is enough for everyone
[37:40] whatever happens let it be, Sanober
[37:43] my son is a king
[38:02] Greetings dear!
greetings!
[38:05] is your work done?
[38:07] yes, its done
[38:11] dad, what is this?
[38:19] the charity of your happiness
[38:25] come, lets go inside
[38:33] lets drink a cup of good tea, then I have to discuss something important with you
[38:40] dad, Altamash had come
[38:44] why he came here?
[38:49] how he dare to step in here?
[38:51] he had some important work with you
[38:55] it means that you are still in contact with them
[39:00] contacts aren't the guarantee of relations, Rutba
[39:04] I am only related to you & your future
[39:09] rest all the relations are just for the sake of fulfillment
[39:14] anyways, let it be
[39:17] let me go & freshen up, meanwhile go & order the tea
[39:21] I have to talk to you, also I want to spend a lot of time with you
[39:25] Ok?
