At least you could have told me so that I wouldn't have been embarrassed at the bank.
How could I tell you since you're not talking to me? It seems that you'll only talk to me once my family bows down in front of you.
Like a wound needs medicine, one needs family when one is hurt.
I have no one here.
That's why I will go to my family like Shenaya.
Will you not listen to your husband?
I already have.
Not anymore...
Your husband is still talking to you.
No... a selfish man is talking who is afraid to be away from his daughter.
She got so jealous when I mentioned Fabiha's name.
And when she got jealous I felt at peace.
Mother, what happened?
Fabiha had to go to the police station yesterday.
You know how Arhum is... he couldn't let her go alone. He went along with her.
I mentioned this to Shenaya.
That was all the spark that was required for a fire
She took out her anger on Fabiha.
Meaning, brother Arhum out of sympathy...
took Fabiha to the police station, and because of that his wife got jealous.
Mother, how does Fabiha look?
What do you mean?
Tell me...
She's good... she has a good smile. Even though she is simple, she looks nice.
Her beauty can come handy to us.
Do as I say.
Here is your favorite french fries and your sandwich.
I don't want to eat this?
Why not?
You made it with your dirty hands.
Hadi don't eat it!
How do you know my hands are dirty?
You are a maid, and a maid always has dirty hands.
I'm a qualified caretaker, not a maid.
I told you that I don't want to eat this.
Auntie Fabiha, after eating we'll see hide and seek.
Sure we will.
It smells good... I think I should eat it.
My mother says that people who get upset with food, food gets upset with them.
Then they have to stay hungry, which can cause them to get sick.
Then you can't go to school or do your homework. Then the teacher scolds you, it's so insulting.
And when you don't eat you get old quickly.
Also, Elsa is beautiful because she takes care of herself.
Now eat it...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Finish this, hurry up.
We...
made a grave mistake asking her to apologize.
We shouldn't have done this.
You are right.
I made the wrong decision in haste.
To get yourself respected...
one has to offer respect to the other person.
If one starts breeding hate in their hearts...
then there is no space left for respect.
She maintained her husband's pride.
Without caring for her respect she stood by my side.
What you're saying is right.
Anyways...
I think we should tolerate her anger like she did ours.
When someone forgives, it stays in their hearts forever...
like that the one who apologizes remembers it forever as well.
I think that we should give her some time.
I will go with you to bring her back, do you hear?
Not right now.
Right now let her be for a few days...
Sometimes we need to be away from someone to be close to them.
God fills a mother's heart with love for her children.
If only He could provide the strength to bear the pain associated with them.
Please don't worry... everything will be alright.
Otherwise you'll get sick. Listen...
I want this to stay in our home. So please...
don't mention this to Shenaya.
I will not...
Thank you.
What can I do?
Please don't worry.
Mother didn't call me today.
Hello...
Greetings*
You didn't call me... so I decided to call you and share with you my happiness.
Do you know after sister-in-law and brother came home, it's been so peaceful at home.
And... mother couldn't believe it.
At least someone found some peace.
What do you mean?
Nothing... what I meant...
Thank God that you guys got some peace in your life.
What is the matter? You seem worried.
You voice is cracking like you cried.
What happened? Is everything alright? Did sister-in-law say something?
No.... it's nothing like that. I was just not feeling well.
I've taken some medicine, I will be alright in a while.
You're not well... I'm coming over...
No... there's no need for that.
Did something happen at home? Tell me the truth!
No... it's nothing like that... don't worry.
Alright.
I was thinking if Anayah could visit today.
Hareem misses her.
Sure, let me ask Junaid...
And... then I'll talk to you. Farewell.
She hung up.
How are you Farheen?
How are you?
You've left me here in hell, you don't care about me.
When are you sending my visa and ticket?
Why do you worry?
Think that I've made permanent arrangements for you.
Meaning?
The visa and ticket will be with you inside ten days.
What? Really?
Of course... I swear.
Haris... you don't know how happy you've made me.
Do one thing...
Tell this to everyone at home...
and be sure to tell your mother. Tell her that Haris..
has change his fate, country and life.
And what was the name of your mother's would be son-in-law... Hamza..
He's still there... go and tell your mother.
Hello Sonia... I was talking to mother just now and I decided to speak with you as well.
I was wondering if Anayah could visit. Hareem misses her and if she comes here maybe we close this recent distance between us.
No... the distances between us won't end Shenaya...
How did you think that I could send Anayah to your home?
Did you not find peace by humiliating me that now you're after my daughter?
After last night, things got back to normal, right?
At your home...
But things are the same at my home. And what kind of home it is... a place where sons-in-law and respected more than daughters-in-law.
I didn't share good news with you... you will be happy to know that I've left your brother.
What... what are you saying?
What you're hearing... congratulations! To save your home, me and my husband have separated.
You should be ashamed.
The way you stole my husband from me and a father from my daughter...
soon you'll have to go through this.
Sonia... listen to me...
Sister-in-law left home and mother didn't tell me.
I am the one who should feel bad, after Hania called you guys, everything went so quiet.
You didn't stand by us during our bad time. What is the point of having such a relationship?
She called? Who did she call?
Did Fareen not tell you that she talked to Hania?
Look... I am ashamed in front of you...
I don't have the words to apologize... I called Hamza a lot of times...
but his phone was switched off.
I didn't expect this from you sister Shaheen.
I was saying..
No one from Hamza's home called... did you get any calls Farheen?
No mother...
I didn't get anyone's call.
Mother! Mother.. Haris called, he said that he would call me to Muscat in a ten or fifteen days.
Haris... Haris.. Haris... that man has humiliated your mother.
Did you get any calls... tell me!
Why don't you speak? Did you get any calls?
Yes...
Then why didn't you tell me? Get out of here... I don't want to see your face.
You can return after ten days to pick up your stuff when you leave. Your mother is dead to you.
Mother, I made a mistake... mother listen to me...
Open the door please!
Please... I made a huge mistake... give me a chance to explain.
Mother...
Mother... please open the door...
Where are you... I got you!
Auntie Fabiha caught father...
It's okay...
Now it's father's turn.
 You guys go ahead...
Let's play father...
Please father.
The kids are asking you to... please play.
Play with the kids... just for a while.
Grab this bag...
Tie this...
I won't be able to... auntie Hadia you go ahead.
Something so big happened and you didn't tell me! Hiding things won't solve matters mother.
My dear, Junaid asked me not to tell you. He didn't want to worry you.
It is worrying for me that my brother's home is getting ruined because of me.
Listen to me... Arhum shouldn't find out about this.
What are you saying? I will talk to brother right now and ask him to bring sister Sonia back right now!
No, don't speak in our matter. Take care of your home.
Mother... when daughters get married they should worrying about their home.
This ruins their reputation.
You're saying that like I am a stranger to that place.
If only you were...
otherwise I wouldn't have to explain it to you this way.
Farewell.
You forgot this outside... auntie had it sent.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, my scarf got stuck.
It's okay.... you could have knocked. You can let me know if you have any problem
You should tell me.
Fabiha...
You should be ashamed... the way you stole my husband from me and my daughter's father from her.
Soon you'll have to go through this
How did you like it?
For what?
Nothing...I just wanted to meet the Shenaya I met in university.
Do you even remember her?
How can I forgot?
It is said that one never forget the first time that someone sees the person they love.
Tell me what you remember about that day? How was my hairstyle... what was I wearing? What standard I was in?
Second standard.
The class was history of architecture...
The clothes were bottle green, you had a brown bag and...
the hairstyle was simple... just a few...
strands here... still it was very simple.
Nice to meet you Mr. Arhum.
The pleasure is all mine Mrs. Arhum.
What is this?
You women are so strange... no matter if you're sad or happy, you start tearing up. Cheer up!
We're going out to dinner... get ready...
Okay.
I'm going to my mother.
Are you afraid?
Afraid of what?
That...
might go away from you.
I have faith in my love.
I have pride over it as well.
And I will never let that pride break.
Greetings sister.
What's for dinner today?
Poison!
What's the matter?
Did you cry all day? And what is this?
Did mother hit you?
There is no need to show me false sympathy, understand?
All of this is happening because of you and Hamza.
Because of Hamza... what did he do? He just came back from jail because of me.
Yes... you and him are just poor souls.
I'm insane... that's all I've heard, all my life.
Ever since I was a child your name has been thrown at my face!
What about the fear that causes me to lie?
Everyone dislikes what I do... but has anyone asked why I do such things?
I've been witnessing this ever since I was a child and now my life has become a circus.
Sister.
May I come in?
Sure... sit down. I want to talk to you.
What is it?
First swear to me that you won't refuse.
Tell me, what is it?
I wanted to talk to you about Fabiha... that girl is alone.
She runs her home without a father or a brother.
She is forced and someone is taking advantage of that.
I want you to help her. I want you to clear her debt.
Did she something to you?
No, she didn't say anything to me.
I'm sure she won't take the money from you.
I will find a way to give it to her.
We can cut it from her salary gradually.
Sure... we'll do as you say.
Alright..
Don't tell Shenaya about this.
Why?
I don't know how she'll take it. I don't want you two fighting because of this.
Alright, I won't tell her. 
Shenaya and I are going out to dinner. The kids are sleeping. We'll be back late.
Make sure it's not too late... you know I get worried sick when I'm alone.
Alright... we'll be back soon.
And... you can call me if you need anything, I'll come right over.
Alright fine... go.
Alright farewell.
May God protect you.
Thank you*
There are some moments in life that whenever you remember them...
you smile.
I brought you here to see you smile.
There are some places that has a special place in one's heart.
And this is one of those places. We started our life here.
We're still together...
And I always want us to be together.
And I promise that I will always stay with you?
Promise?
Promise.
Mother, I admit that she didn't tell you about Hania's call... but what need was there to slap her?
There was... I cannot tolerate lies.
Mother you know how she is...
I tolerated her enough times!
Do you know how embarrassed I was in front of your mother-in-law.
I know, that why I asked you to call Hamza, then why didn't you?
I did... it was switched off.
What time is this for load shedding? Let me check.
We ate, had coffee... what are we waiting for? Let's go...
Just two minutes... one... two... three...
Oh my God...
Happy anniversary*
Let's cut the cake and celebrate..
Thank you Arhum...
It's just us who lost our light.
Surprise!
Sings happy birthday*
Sings happy birthday*
Sings happy birthday*
And... 
How did you like my surprise?
What is all this Hamza?
What do you mean? It's like I'm doing something like this for the first time.
Fabiha it's been five years since our relationships... and we've celebrated five birthdays together.
I'm not a child...
He loves you and you should answer him back with love.
Come on, cut the cake.
Give me the knife...
Here you are.
Call sister as well.
You call her.
Sings happy birthday*
Sings happy birthday*
Sings happy birthday*
Sings happy birthday*
Sister... come and have cake.
This is something to celebrate... I'll feed it to her myself.
I congratulate you on your sister's birthday... open your mouth!
Come on... open your mouth..
What kind of behavior is this?
I apologize on behalf of Farheen.
There is no need for that... don't I know her... it's alright.
Fabiha... go and make a cup of tea for Hamza, and clean this up.
Sit down my dear...
Why didn't you change?
I just want time to stop...
Shenaya, all my time is yours. Whether day or night...
It makes no difference what it is.
It does.
This is the time...
where we are with each other. We are near each other.
Otherwise we fulfill each other responsibilities.
Are you afraid?
About what?
That...
I might go away from you?
I have full faith in my love...
I have pride over it as well.
I will never break this pride break.
I know.
Go and change now...
Oh!
Who is it?
It's call time for tomorrow. I have a meeting with a client.
Alright...
I'll go and change... and yes...
Hadi's teacher called, tomorrow is defense day, he's performing and we have to be there.
Anything else?
Nothing.
What did you just do outside? If you didn't want to eat the cake, you could have come inside, why did you throw it away?
If someone wants to eat cake they can, I didn't want to.
Tell me... why do you mind? You treat Hamza the same when you want to.
Now that I've done this today... your dormant love for him has awakened.
I don't humiliate him.
It's not that different. Whether someone refuses with love or anger...
That person is always humiliated.
You took out mother's anger on him.
Yes... Haris gets humiliated as well. Ask Hamza to get used to it.
What you're doing is not right.
Tell that to mother. I'll be fine once she stops differentiating.
Besides... it's only a matter of a few days now.
Haris is sending my visa and ticket. I've talked to him.
Anything else?
Arhum get up... it's eight...
Arhum, you're running late.. get up.
Arhum...
Don't you feel like going to work today?
What happened? Are you feeling well?
My body hurts and I feel a fever coming.
Then why didn't you tell me? I would have turned off the AC... you must be feeling cold.
You don't have a temperature.
I think you have flu or a cough... you'll be alright.
I'll bring breakfast and the medicine as well.
I'll call my boss and cancel the meeting.
No... you have an important meeting.
If you cancel last moment, your boss will get upset.
I'll manage... go...
Nothing is more important than you.
I'll handle my boss. It's an international client, you won't find another one easily.
Go ahead... just get me breakfast. I'll have the medicine once I'm down.
I'll keep the breakfast at the table. Be sure to take your medicine.
Please take care.... go..
