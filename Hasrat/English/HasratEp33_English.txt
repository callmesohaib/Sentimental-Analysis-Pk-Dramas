Hello mom. 
 Hello. You're back soon?
Mom, you do know, I have an alternate on Friday.
I met Hamza today.
He looked angry. He didn't even talk to me properly.
When a man hates the woman he loved,
then he hates everything associated with it.
Do you know, he has sold his house?
When I talked about a loan in office, I found out.
Oh well. His case is finished. He was so worried.
Hmm. Thank God.
Mom.. I told him about Fabiha as well. But he didn't ask anything.
How she is? Where she is or if we tried to find her.. nothing at all.
She's alive. Not dead.
Why are you saying that? Did you talk to Fabiha?
She called. 
 So where is she? Did you ask her?
Why should I ask?
She can go to hell as far as I care.
What are you saying mom? She might be in a problem? 
 She is in no problem. She sounded fine.
And even if she's in a problem, its created by her own self.
Hmm.. whats happening? 
 I'm making meatballs for the evening.
Meatballs? You're working very hard.
My brother likes meatballs a lot.
He requested me to make them.
What have you put in them? 
 Salt, turmeric, yogurt.. all these things.
Did you forget to put chillies? 
 I did..
Its alright. I'll help you.
What did you do?
What did I do?
I helped you.
Are these too much?
Oh.. You'll have to do all the hard work again.
I'm sorry.
So sad..
May I come in? 
 Why are you here?
I asked why are you here? Are you here to see what spectacle I've become? 
 I'm here to return the money I borrowed from the company.
I'm here to tell you that those who commit fraud, they run away. They don't stick to their facts.
Some people sell their conscience. Thank God I'm not one of those. My conscience is alive.
Sanaya mam.. its the way of the world. Only the innocent get punished.
You and I are travelers of the same boat.
As soon as she got married, you got a cheque worth millions. Weird, isn't it?
What do you mean? 
 You're reacting as if you don't know.
What do I not know? 
 Don't tell me you don't know Fabiha has married Arham?!
What?! This..
What are you saying, mam? 
 The same you heard.
Get out.
I didn't know. I didn't.. 
 I made a mistake trusting you and hiring Fabiha.
Its because of you that my life is destroyed. Remember this..
You wouldn't ever settle down too, Hamza.
Get lost from here.
I... 
 Get out..
Don't tell me you didn't know Fabiha married Arham?!
I made a mistake, I trusted you and hired Fabiha. My life was destroyed because of you, Hamaza. Remember this. Even you will never be happy.
Yes I have an affair with him. I love him. I don't want to live with you. I can never feel the same for you Hamza.
What will I do living with you? What will you give me? Poverty? Hunger? 
I have freed myself from this relationship long ago and it would be best if Hamza did the same.
Move out of my way. 
 Oh you want something?
We're hungry. We want a sandwich.
Just this? I'll get it ready in five minutes. 
 I'm telling you to move out of my way.
Move!
How can I not go inside? I'll see!
I want to slap you so hard that this world can hear me.
But my love and my honor doesn't allow me to.
I wasn't stupid. I was blinded by your love, Fabiha.
I want to burn your world. You have made me fall down so low in my eyes.
But my love and my honor does not allow me for this.
I haven't been brought up this way.
I wasn't disloyal to you. I never claimed to love you.
You drowned with your own perspective. And what do you think? You'll barge into this house?
And I'll tolerate everything? You'll raise your hand on me?
I'm not scared of you. Do you understand?
If after today, you even dared to come in this house, you'll see the worst of me. Get lost..
Mom, this is the limit. Its not acceptable at all. Now will this girl's lover visit our house?
How will it affect our daughters? My daughter is here as well, under Fabiha's influence.
Mom.. you'll have to talk to Arham. If you don't talk to him, I'll do it myself.
What happened Hadia? Whats happening?
I'll talk to Arham.
My child...
Mom.. I'm worried about Hareem. Look at how scared she is.
How will she be brought up? 
 Sanaya should have thought about it.
She has sent the kid here and forgot about everything.
Mom.. Hareem is our blood. Our child. What will happen if we leave her on Fabiha?
What will she become when she grow up? Bold, brazen?
Let Arham come back. I'll talk to him.
I will do it.
Let your father come. We'll talk to him.
I don't want to create a scene in the office. Its best if you leave. 
 I'll not leave without talking to you.
There's nothing to talk about but if you want any more sacrifices out of me, I'm sorry.
I will not sacrifice anymore. 
 I and the kids cannot live without you. Stop being stubborn.
Stubborn? Stubborn?
And then I should share my husband happily? 
 Sanaya I want to see you with me and I know you cannot live without me.
Don't punish yourself.
Keep yourself in my place just once.
If you had been there in my place and it was about a girl's respect?
 You gambled my entire life to save her respect.
You were a man, you had rights.
You could have done anything just not be disloyal.
A person only does something if he wants to. 
 Sanaya, everything can be forgotten.
Change your decision for the sake of our children. 
 Do you want to hear the truth?
The truth is I don't want to bring up my children in a home where their father is divided between two women.
It will be better if I keep fighting for my right. The effect the tussle of our egos will have on our kids,
it is better that I leave you.
This is my final decision.
I don't want to snatch Hareem from you so it would be best if you can give her to me without any fight.
You're her father. You can be trusted to be a good father.
But Fabiha is her step mother. I don't even want her shadow to fall on my kids.
Don't do this. 
 You should have thought about it earlier.
You can leave now, Arham.
What happened? Did you talk to Sanaya? How is she? 
 I couldn't talk to her at night.
But when I went to her room in the morning, she wasn't there. Maybe she went to drop Hadi to school and then office.
Isn't she back from work yet? 
 No.
Junaid, its best for her to spend more time in the office.
Because if she stays here, she'll keep thinking about everything.
We can only offer support but only she knows what she's going through.
But we cannot ignore all this. Its important to talk to Sanaya for all this.
Junaid, I think we should give her time. All this isn't easy for her.
You're right. We should wait for her. Lets see what she decides.
I have decided brother. 
 What have you decided?
I want a divorce from Arham.
What are you saying, Sanaya?
I've decided.
Mom.. please calm yourself down. Come here. Mom.. Look after her.
Mom, sit down. Do you want water? 
 No.. Sanaya...
Arham, what is it? What happened?
Sanaya has decided to leave me.
Relationships don't end so easily. Don't worry. She's saying this because she's emotional. Its not possible for her as well.
Fabiha.. I know Sanaya.. when she decides something,
she stands by it and now she has decided.
Fabiha, I cannot live without my kids.
And not even without Sanaya..
Where is Hareem?
Have you seen what she did? She should have told her lover that she was married so he wouldn't have barged into our house.
Did you see Hareem's condition?
Hamza came here? 
 Yes. He barged in and claimed to love her in front of the children.
Think about it.. is this how things work in our house?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
You know how Hamza turns mad? 
 He goes crazy? This is the first mad man..
How do we know how many such crazy men will come to our house? 
 Hadia!
What Hadia? You leave your daughter with a woman whose not with one man herself. 
 Enough! Quiet.
Not a word more. I'll forget that you're my sister.
I am not such a girl, Hadia.
Should I tell everyone what sort of a girl you are?
You left your fiance and married a father with two children..
You ridiculed your mother's respect.. 
 We're a respectable family. Will you keep her in this house?
What respect will we have in the family? Don't you know what we call such girls... 
 Hadia!
Enough! Enough!
What have you turned me into?!
First she was bad and now she is bad too..
If she had been here, she'd have been bad. My luck is bad.
You'll get my dead body in this house one day.
Then you'll be happy.
I keep fighting everybody outside and come home for peace.
And this is what I get? You come here and feed her nonsense. My house is in this state because of you Hadia.
I love my children. I'm not an animal. I know they're my kids.
I didn't do this knowingly. It just happened.
Forgive me. I've had enough.
Please. I don't want anything.
Brother..
Mom.. Mom?
Brother? Brother? Mom...
Mom.. 
 What happened to mom? Fabiha, call the ambulance. Mom..
What happened to mom? 
 What happened to her?
Mom? Mom? 
 Hadia, keep mom upright.
Divorce? This isn't the right decision. Sanaya is wrong, Junaid.
What are you saying? Whether her decision is right or wrong, she has the right to decide for her life.
We cannot force her to live with Arham. 
 This means, you'll not make your sister understand? If she walks the wrong path,
would you not explain her or bring her to the right path? 
 Mom is right Junaid.
You should talk to Sanaya. Maybe she'll listen to you.
I know mom is right but this is our point of view. Sanaya has her own perspective.
She is thinking about herself and her kids. Who are we to stop her? 
 Whatever she's thinking is wrong.
We cannot live our lives without our men. She can live without her husband but a father will never live without his kids.
A mother will never live without her kids and the kids will be divided between the tussle these two have.
Mom.. my dear mom.. try and understand me. She has decided. Its useless arguing with her now.
I think we shouldn't bother Sanaya. 
 Can I see my daughter destroying herself?
Can you not make her understand? At least tell her to give it some time. Haste makes bad decisions, Junaid.
Mom is right.. 
 What should I tell her Soumya? What should I say? Can I promise her that I'll throw Fabiha out of Arham's life?
What are you saying? Mom, please control yourself.
I'm telling you that we shouldn't worry.
Whatever Sanaya has decided, let her. Trust God. Why should we worry about something that hasn't happened?
Do you know that she does what she says and she'll keep on doing what she said?
Mom, please calm down. You'll get sick. 
 You get water for mom.
I'll get water.. 
 I don't want water.
Don't worry. How can I tell you? 
 Oh my God..
Mom?
Mom? 
 Not now Soumya. Leave me alone.
Mom.. please be strong. 
 I cannot, Soumya.
Sanaya's decision has made me restless.
I'm thinking I should meet her myself and make her understand to change her decision.
Junaid has raised his hands from the matter.
I'm her mother. I cannot see my daughter being destroyed. I'll try my best to make her understand.
Maybe she'll understand. 
 Alright. Don't get worried sick.
