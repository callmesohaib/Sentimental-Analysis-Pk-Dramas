I'm so sorry. Please sit. I'm so sorry you had to wait. What will you have? Tea? Coffee?
No mam. Nothing.
Fabiha, Hamza told me you've been working for long.
Yes mam. She has been working in this field for five years now.
Very good. So did anyone have any complaints with you in these five years?
Or did you have any complaints about anyone?
No. 
Absolutely fine.
My mother in law is paralyzed.
And you know how such patients are treated.
She had an attack on the left side. You'll have to help her exercise and physiotherapy.
From 9am to 7pm in the evening. I cannot afford holidays.
You don't worry at all.
Perfect. Alright then. Now you tell me what salary are you expecting?
Whatever you think is fine. 
 Alright. You can join from tomorrow.
Fabiha. 
 I'm really sorry. Are you hurt?
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.
Its okay.
You people here? 
 Sanaya mam called us for the caretaker job.
Oh alright. How was your meeting? 
 It went good.
I'm Sanaya's husband. 
 Hie.
I'm Fabiha's fiance. 
 Well thanks for coming.
Lets go Fabiha. Bye sir. 
 Bye.
Open your mouth. Good boy. 
 Mom?
Hadi's teacher complained. He doesn't eat his lunch himself. He gives it to others.
Its bad. Why don't you have your lunch? You should finish your lunch box. Okay?
Mom makes it with so much love. You should eat it. Oh. Its you?
You're home early today. 
 Yes. I had a meeting and en route I found out we had to wait for an hour.
So I thought I'd come home. So did you find a caretaker?
She'll come tomorrow. 
 Okay. You serve lunch. I'll get mom.
Eat fast. Finish your food fast. Show mom, how can you eat yourself?
I didn't get to spend time with you since so many days so I thought I'd have lunch with you today.
I have no objections, you can give it to me on my room only. If only I get it on time. I'll pray for your wife then.
Sanaya, get porridge for mom and heat the pulses too. 
 Sure.
Do you want water? 
 No dear. I've been drinking that for long.
Your plate. 
 Thank you.
Mom, first we need to inject insulin.
I've told Sanaya to give it to you in front of me. 
 Alright.
When did this happen? 
 Mom, if she gives you insulin in front of me, I'll be satisfied and you'll be fine soon. If God wills.
Alright. I should either get better fast or die.
Kids feel their mothers are a burden if they get sick. Your wife already has a lot of responsibilities.
Mom, why are you thinking this? You're my responsibility. Not Sanaya's.
I'm your mother. I know what you say yourself and what others make you say.
Alright. Don't be angry. Its not good for your health. Please eat.
Mom? I'll wear my Elsa frock to grandma's house for dinner.
Okay.
You have a dinner with your in laws? You people have a plan for dinner?
Yes. Its been a lot of days Sanaya hasn't visited her mother. I thought kids would meet their grandma too. They're missing her.
Alright. It would have been good if she could have taken permission from her mother in law.
My mother did call you.
When?
Nobody called me. When? 
 She called you.
I might have missed it. She could have told me.
I wouldn't have gone with you. I would have at least known.
Alright, I'll call mom to call you. 
 No. Let it be. There's no need now.
If you give importance to someone when its too late, its like slapping them.
Oh well. I'll take it in my room. 
 Mom, finish your porridge at least.
Let it be dear. I'm full. I'll take it along.
You two finish your lunch.
Mom.. why is grandma always upset with you?
Finish your lunch, fast.
Thank God, you have such a good job confirmed.
And with such a handsome salary. 
 Thanks to you. It was possible because of you.
You do so much for me. 
 When two hearts become one, nothing is separate.
You'll always find me with you at every step.
Alright, I'm getting late. Drop me at the hospital. God knows how much bill the hospital must have made.
Don't worry. 
 Where will you pay from?
Its my problem.
But Hamza.. 
I told you. I have.
You haven't gone home since last night. Did you talk to aunty?
Lets go. Get up.
Where did he go? He didn't even tell me. He hasn't come home all night.
Mom, how do you know he didn't come home? Sometimes he leaves when we're sleeping in the morning.
I woke up for the Fajr prayers. I saw the lights in Hamza's room switched on.
I thought I'd go and switch them off but Hamza wasn't there.
I'm worried about Hamza.
Why isn't he answering? 
 Nothing will happen mom. Don't worry. Its ringing but he isn't answering.
Your bag. 
 Alright. Now go home. Aunty must be worried.
Alright. 
 Listen. Take care.
You too.
Hello? 
 Hello? Hamza? Where are you?
I'm just leaving the hospital. 
 Hospital? Are you alright?
Give it to me. Hamza dear?
Where are you? You,
are you alright? What are you doing in the hospital?
Yes mom. Everything is alright. Don't worry. It was an emergency so I couldn't tell you.
Fabiha's mother had a heart attack. I'll tell you everything when I get home.
Shaheen is in the hospital. She had a heart attack. If he had told me, I'd have gone with him.
We need family at this hour. The girls are all alone. 
 Mom..
What if something happens to Shaheen aunty? What will become of Farheen and Fabiha?
God forbid.
But we all need to bow down when its a test from God.
Whatever God has written in our fate. It will happen.
May God pull these girls out of this test.
Dear, do one thing. Call and ask about Fabiha after a while.
To be honest, I'm worried more about my brother. If Fabiha is worried, he won't be at peace.
You're right. He always get worried when she's worried. He's happy when she's happy.
This is the identity of a good life partner.
We shouldn't love someone so much that we breakdown if that person commits a mistake.
What happened?
Fabiha is a strong girl with a good character.
I don't think bad about her at all and you shouldn't either.
But I feel she's a bit hesitant. As if she needs distance.
Don't think so deep. Some people are habitual of talking less.
She's reserved. You should also talk less.
She is so clever. I didn't know. Look at her face.
She looks so innocent. Oh my God, forgive me. 
 Now do you understand?
I wasn't wrong. Not only our sister in law, but her mother is very clever as well.
Yes. Don't even talk about her mother. She's so secretive.
Ever since I'm bedridden they have thrown me out like a fly from milk.
Look at my son. They have dinner at their house today.
He couldn't even ask me before he left. That mom..
will you go along? Or not. Not at all. 
 Did she call you?
Yes. I did. I didn't tell them.
Its good. Now both the mother and sister will give clarifications to Arham now. 
 You did good.
Will you be alone at home now? 
 What else?
Its in our fate to be alone. 
 Its not your fate mom. Your daughter in law has made you all alone.
And what is this? How can they leave their mother alone? I'm amazed at you.
You should created a fuss and said no to Arham.
Who listens to me in this house?
Alongside the daughter, the mother too wants to control the husband.
Yes both of them want the same thing. Otherwise my Arham, who would come running to me if I shouted once,
he is following his in laws as if they didn't give away their daughter but we gave away our son.
Mom, to tell you the truth, who is with you throughout the day? Who takes care of you?
Sanaya and Arham take days off alternately. 
 So what could be better than that?
The day Arham takes off, be so good that there's nobody better and the day Sanaya takes off,
you show your real face. Just make sure you clear it to Arham that you don't bother anyone at all.
And make Sanaya tell him you irritate her a lot. You'll see the chaos then.
And how you'll have to do, you know well. 
 You're right.
You're no less either.
Hania, bring water for your brother.
How did all this happen all of a sudden? How is Shaheen now?
She's out of danger now. 
 Thank God.
You must be tired, dear. You mustn't have eaten anything.
Hania? Get food for your brother. 
 No. Let it be for me.
Do one thing, get me something for Farheen and Fabiha. I'll eat with Fabiha.
You were in the hospital since last night. Rest for a while before you go anywhere.
Who asked you for advise? Go do your work. 
 Alright. Don't rest.
I'm talking for your best. You're always shouting. 
 What happened? Why are you arguing with your younger sister always?
Like you're worried for Fabiha, she's worried for you as well.
I don't understand all this right now. I'm also worried mom.
Fabiha?
I couldn't understand anything. I did what I thought was fine.
If something had happened to mom, I would have never forgiven you.
I know I made a big mistake but this doesn't mean you blame me for everything.
Circumstances often take a person's life.
My luck was bad but you supported the bad luck and wronged your mother.
Fabiha, what else do I have?
Mom's love came in your share. A good life partner came in your share. What did I get?
Wait.. hatred. helplessness.
And if I did something for my peace, why did it cause such a big mess?
When a person stops looking at right and wrong, the don't even see if there's a river in front of them.
Just pray that our mother isn't punished for the mistakes you made.
Yes I did call your mother in law and invite her for dinner. Did she tell you?
No. I know. And you know Arham as well. I cannot say anything against his mom to him.
And she clearly said Arham was lying. So I cannot argue now. If I argue, things will get worse.
What must Arham be thinking about us? 
You didn't put a condition that my mother in law would be like a mom to me, when you got me married.
Dear, parents with daughters are always suffering from this fear. All their life.
And, if only our daughters' happiness be given to them when they get married.
Mom, I'm very happy. Don't worry. Tell me did you make arrangements for dinner?
Yes, Soumya is doing everything. You know she cooks really well.
Alright, we'll meet tonight at the dinner. Bye. 
 Okay mom. Bye.
Did you talk to Sanaya? What did she say? When will she come? 
 I did talk.
They'll come around 9- 10 pm. Actually, she has to give dinner to her mother in law.
Its surprising how did her mother in law accept so easily? 
 Does she accept anything so easily?
She told Arham that I didn't invite her. 
 What?!
And Arham believed her?
I don't understand. Does Arham not see how clever his mother is or does he ignore?
Sometimes they have to ignore in such relationships. He doesn't want to answer back.
I'm alright Fabiha. Nothing happened to me. 
 What if it did?
Where will we go? What would we do? Have you ever thought? You just held your heart and laid down.
Like my bad luck, my heartbeats are also very stubborn.
They'll not stop so easily.
Mom..
Fabiha, tell her to leave from my sight.
Ask her to leave. 
 Please..
You should go for now.
Don't think about it. 
 Dear.. I just had hopes pinned on my jewelry.
To get rid of all the wretchedness.
But Farheen snatched that as well.
There's only one way to save our respect.
What? 
 You should marry Hamza as soon as possible and make him the protector of your respect.
See.. there is no room for saying no.
Bad luck isn't in our hand but,
we do have our respect and disrespect in our hands. 
 Mom..
I have a job now. I'll pay him back very soon. Why are you worried? 
 But dear..
You cannot earn hundred thousands in two days.
One day has already passed.
I'll go and ask doctors for the discharge.
What should I do? I don't have money in my account and there's time in my salary.
Hello? Hammad? Sorry I'm disturbing you right now but,
there's an emergency. Fabiha's mother is hospitalized. She had a heart attack.
I need some money. 25000.
I'll return as soon as my salary comes. Please have it arranged for me. Anyway possible. I'll return them to you.
Alright. Fine. Fine. I'll ask Haider. Okay.
Yes mom? You called. 
 I feel suffocated sitting inside.
Take me to the lawn. 
 Alright, I'll take you.
Give me my scarf.
Hania, what is this? 
 They aren't much but they'll be useful to you.
How did you get so much money? 
 Its my pocket money. I saved them for you.
Brothers can forget their sisters in bad times but sisters will never forget their brothers.
Come here. Sit with me. Sit down.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you this way.
You were never like this, brother. I don't know what has happened to you.
I am like this. 
 No. You were never like this.
You're lost when you loved someone and started worrying for them.
Its not that Hania. 
 It is so.
Otherwise, someone who could hide his worries behind a smile and didn't make his mom and sister realize,
today he cannot hide a single pain. Why? What happened?
You're in love. People learn to live when in love.
You've finished yourself.
What can I do Hania? I cannot do anything for Fabiha, even when I want to.
What do you want to do?
I want her to be free of all her responsibilities so that she can only love me.
She can give me time and only think about me. So that she's only mine.
They are yours. Keep them.
Make me a milkshake. 
 Sure.
And listen, make it cold. Don't make it hot like your temperament.
Sure.
Yes mom? 
 My mobile fell down. Please pick it up.
Thank you dear. 
 Mom, anything else?
Nothing.
Yes mom? 
 This milkshake spilled on my clothes.
I didn't have tissue or else I'd have cleaned it up. Get me a tissue.
I'll get it.
Yes? 
 Just take me inside now.
I don't have the bad fate in my hand, but..
we do have our respect and disrespect in our hands.
Alright now. 
 Where are you going?
Actually, I have to get the kids' clothes for tonight. I'm going to do that.
Yes. You can do that. Make me exercise. The doctor said at least two times in the day.
Physiotherapy. I cannot do it alone.
Hello? Haris? Hello? Haris?
Haris, can you hear me? Hello.
The net had to die right now. I'll call uncle.
Hello? Hello uncle. This is Farheen.
What should I tell you? We have one problem after another, uncle.
Yes. Mom had a heart attack.
Yes. Yes. She's better now. She's at home. Uncle,
did you meet Haris?
What? You don't know Haris came there? But he told me he had informed you.
Yes. Yes. I talked to him last night. He said he'd meet you definitely.
Alright. Uncle, let me know when you meet him.
Alright. Fine. Okay. Bye.
