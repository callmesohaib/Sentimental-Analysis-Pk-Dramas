parents await their children's happiness in their old age
But my fate took a toll on her in her old age
she couldn't tolerate it
that's why I never wanted to bother her
how will we spend our life without her?
she never did anything bad for anyone
nor she wanted anything bad for anyone
then why my mom was treated so badly, brother?
Sanaya, I had promised her
I will never let you feel the absence of your father in your life
your brother promise you
he will never leave you alone
Why did Mom die, brother?
Perhaps her life was meant to be this short
I had never thought that Arham
will become such a stone-hearted person
He became completely obsessed with that woman
He doesn't care for me or the kids at all
neither he cared about my mother's folded hands
today I am leaving my matter on God, brother
God has willed it Fabiha, you have got such a big garden in your house
You can grow vegetables for yourself; this way, you'll be able to save money too
I am so stupid, you don't have any lack of money now, right, Mom?
I am thinking that the person who realizes he will face the consequences of his actions.
So, why haven't you thought that way about yourself?
what path you're following
do you even know what will be its consequences?
Fabiha, I am scared of that woman's curse
Whose family you broke and created your own
mom, what are you saying? What happened?
I haven't broken anyone's family
Whatever happened with Sanaya, it happened because of her own actions
When a woman does not give time to her man, then she may face similar consequences to what happened with Sanaya
her professional life was more important for her, than Arham
and what about man, mom
he gets influenced to any other way anytime
don't make her fault my sin
you will be saved from a woman's curse, Fabiha
but how will you be saved from a mother's curse?
And think about those kids whose father has left them.
when I haven't done anything wrong, then why shall I be scared?
You are unnecessarily worrying yourself by thinking about such things, and you are also worrying me.
Sanaya was trying to harm my baby, which is why Arham kicked her out of our house.
you will tell me this Fabiha
Was Sanaya killing your baby in real?
Arham saw that with his own eyes, mom
I am not lying
really?
Then swear on your to-be baby's life?
swear upon him
why did you stop?
tell me
mom, this baby is not only mine but you also have a relation with him
You should be more worried about him than me. I don't know why you don't trust me?
And I am telling the truth, Arham took such a big step when he saw this
Otherwise, why would Arham have done this without thinking long and hard?
Fabiha I agree that you are my daughter
And for every mother, her children's happiness is most dear to her
but honestly speaking, I am so upset about Sanaya
and her kids
I have always distinguished between right and wrong
so how come now I shall say the wrong thing as right?
there is a difference between snatching & getting it easily, mom
I haven't snatched anything from anyone, Arham came to me himself
so, how can I pronounce my fate as wrong?
but still I tried my best to stay together & live with each other
But her jealousy prevented me from finding my place in this house or in Arham's heart
but still I tried to adjust, mom
but nothing got fixed
but your prayers are with me, so nothing will go wrong now
dear, my prayers are always with you
they were always there, and they'll be always there for you
mothers always pray for their children happiness
I will always pray for your happiness
a mother's prayers are never refused, mom
that's what I am scared of
what if your happiness gets affected by someone's evil eye
anyways, leave all this
Tell me, did you go to the doctor? What did they say? Is everything okay?
mom, everything is fine & the baby is healthy
thank God!
by the way I am happy that
Arham is a nice person & he takes very good care of you
you also take care of him
Fabiha look, being a mother I would like to give an advice to you
this bungalow, this car, this money...
it doesn't have any importance, dear
if you have to sacrifice it for Arham, then do it
there is no value of money, dear
you can earn money anytime, it will come again
mom, what are you saying? Its all mine & why will I spend it on someone else?
dear look, a loan is returned
and Arham is a loan for you from Sanaya
always remember that
anyways Fabiha, its very late now. Can you please call a cab for us?
yes sister
sister, I can't find any cab right now
try to book it from your phone
ok, one minute
No Fabiha, even my request is not being accepted
do one thing, ask Arham to drop us
hey no...
We'll go on the auto rickshaw, its okay
what's wrong with you mom, how will we go alone in the rickshaw so late night?
ok wait, let me call Hamza
No..
there is no need to call Hamza here
why?
What's the harm, Mom? If Hamza comes to pick us up, he'll wait outside. He won't come inside.
As it is, Hamza had told me that if I go somewhere at night, I should not come back alone. I should call him
let me call him, no problem
hello! Hamza
Sanaya
I am taking out some food for brother
I know he hasn't eaten anything since coming back from the graveyard. Don't you worry.
I will feed him the food
even you haven't eaten anything
hunger, thirst.. everything got buried with mom
gather yourself, Sanaya
I don't understand that...
for which grief I shall cry out loudly
on one side, I have the grief of my family and on the other side
I have my mother's grief
I will share my mother's grief with my brother but..
 a mother gives courage for the other thing, sister
we are with you
you are not alone
I know you are with me
food..
I am not hungry, feed this food to the kids
You know, Mother never used to sleep until you ate your food.
She also knew that I couldn't sleep without her
Why did she leave me?
brother...
this room
this room had peace due to her presence
brother...
brother, look here. Gather yourself
if you will shatter in this manner then how will handle us all?
as it is, this life is a journey
when & how anyone's journey's end, nobody knows
look at me, look here
how I am standing in front of you, after loosing everything
I am left with my brother only
if you'll shatter in this manner, then on whose shoulder I will cry upon brother?
control yourself for God sake, please
I cannot
I am not getting shattered
I am feeling so weak after losing such a great support like a mother
I am feeling so scared
brother, this is the time to nurture our relations
to support each other, & to wipe off each others tears
I cannot see you crying like this
what's the big deal, if our mother is not here
You have a sister who is like a motherly figure to you
do you know Sanaya
Very few people have someone to wipe away their tears
gather yourself, brother
I cannot see your crying, for God sake please gather yourself
 gather yourself
I am fine
drink some water
dear, take very good care of yourself. Ok?
you also take very good care, mom
bye!
Hamza!
shall we go?
lets go dear
Fabiha aunty, I'm feeling hungry. Please give me some food
ok fine, go & sit on the dining table. I am bringing it
and listen! Don't call me again & again. Sit with patience
Don't come into the room. It wouldn't be good if you come in there
come on, go
Arham
where were you?
you didn't even come home the entire night
I am asking you something, where were you?
I was at Sanaya's house
at least you could have informed me
Fabiha, her mother died
what!
that's why I was stuck & couldn't tell you
but how come all of a sudden?
I was about to divorce Sanaya
and during that her mother got a heart attack
her mother died because of me, Fabiha
I took away everything from Sanaya
I don't know what to do
I did such a grave mistake
I don't understand anything Fabiha..
that how shall I gather everything?
Sanaya... kids
I have ruined everyone's life
neither I am a good husband or a good father
what's wrong with you Arham, gather yourself I am with you
Sanaya needs me Fabiha
I should be with her
Hello!
Hello! Greetings
how are you, sister?
A person whose mother has passed away would likely experience profound grief and sadness
you have also experienced this pain, and you can understand it very well
yes, I do have an idea
Actually, I couldn't talk to my brother; perhaps he was busy with the funeral the entire day
that's why I am calling very late for the condolence
Sister, how did all of this happen? I can't believe it.
what happened all of a sudden?
nothing happened all of a sudden, Hadia
all of this happened because of your brother
he gave me a horrible punishment of being his wife
what do you mean?
he came to take away my children from me
your brother came to divorce me
divorce!
He left our relationship stranded in the middle of obstacles
he had started
but now I will end it
I am sorry, sister
We all are responsible for your destruction
its nobody's fault, Hadia
If the person whom I loved the most is no longer with me, how can I complain about others?
tell your brother
that Sanaya will never forgive him
I had entrusted Arham's love to myself
but now my love is a loan on Arham
I will take back everything
hello!
brother...
I didn't expect this from you
brother
a lot had happened
and you didn't even tell me
After Fabiha arrived, sister Sanaya left your heart in such a manner
that the matter had reached to an extent of divorce
Hadia, I made a mistake while being emotional
being emotional?
brother, do you know
you always do like this
you make rational decisions, then you regret upon them
you had lost your mother while being emotional
and now its turn to loose your wife & children
This girl has blinded you with a web of lies
that you can't see anything
Hadia, tell me what shall I do?
honestly, I don't understand anything
shall I tell you, what you should do?
just wait
just wait for sister-in-law's revenge
I had a word with her
She has clearly said that she will never forgive you
and for sure, she will take revenge from you
brother...
please don't do this
handle everything by any means
Don't take Sister Sanaya's curse
its not right for you
what do you think?
the delusion in which you are
that if you ever have any regret or anything bad happens to you
then this girl Fabiha will support you
do you really think that she will support you?
She will be the first one to leave you
then you will realize
please brother, don't do this
I don't understand one thing, brother
that how come you couldn't see
If a girl couldn't belong to her own mother, then how will she belong to you?
Hadia, even I am sorry about Sanaya
honestly speaking, even I am not getting peace after all this
you will not get any peace, brother
shall I give you a suggestion?
if you really want to see yourself in peace
and seek tranquility
Then tomorrow are the funeral proceedings for sister's mother
please do visit there
spend time with your children, spend time with sister Sanaya
shall I say one more thing to you?
Please ensure to take Hadi over there
and leave him there
please
I cannot leave Hadi there
You know I cannot live without my kids, and I had left Hareem over there while thinking about it
but nobody will see that
how much a father suffers because
Maybe a man doesn't know how to express what he is going through
a man is always wrong
always...
were you talking to Hadia?
yes
what was she saying?
Nothing special, she was just talking about here & there
go to sleep, its quite late night
I was about to divorce Sanaya
and during that her mother got a heart attack
her mother died because of me, Fabiha
I took way everything from Sanaya
I did such a grave mistake
I don't understand anything Fabiha..
that how shall I gather everything?
Sanaya... kids
I have ruined everyone's life
what's wrong with you Arham, gather yourself I am with you
Sanaya needs me Fabiha
I should be with her
If Sanaya's sympathy remains in his heart in the same manner, then one day she will be present in this house
you need to do something before that, Fabiha
