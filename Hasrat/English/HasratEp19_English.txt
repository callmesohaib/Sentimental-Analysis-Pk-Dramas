Take a look.
This is how girls are supposed to be? Willing to let go their happiness for the happiness of others.
Sometimes it's good to let go of one's happiness for others...
Mother...
I told you not to come home with this man. Did you understand?
You lied to me in the morning as well. Does Hamza know that you went to the hospital in the morning?
Did you tell him or not?
No.
Really... so you lied and made a fool out of your mother.
Sofia, can you postpone the meeting with Mr. Sikander?
I'll be in a little late today. Please take care of it.
Okay, bye
Mother... could you help me with my tie.
I'll be right there my dear.
Yes my dear... your tie is supposed to be here.
How many times have I told you that you're old enough to do this yourself.
Is your bag ready?
Let me check.
Your geometry box isn't here. Where is it?
Auntie Fabiha would know?
Why would she? To whom does the geometry box belong to?
It's yours, right? Then you should know.
Mother... you give her money to take care of us and granny, right?
Then whose responsibility is it? Auntie Fabiha, right?
Mother here's my geometry box, you know nothing.
Let's go mother.... father must be waiting for us at the breakfast table.
Let's go Hadi.
Mother...
Mother.
I'm leaving.
Mother, are you upset?
Why would I be upset?
What right do I have over you? I tried to explain things to Farheen, she didn't listen. I tried explaining things to you, you didn't understand.
But now I understand and I'm not upset.
Sit down and listen to me.
I admit that I made a mistake. I shouldn't have hid things from you.
But if I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have let me go.
Mother, I had already told Arhum.
You only care about Arhum...
but you don't care about your honor and your mother's word, right?
He is the one who is maintaining our honor, he did us a favor, how can you forget that?
Haroon gave you the money as well, was he trustworthy?
Money can't buy trust, understand?
Listen to me, Arhum is an honorable man.
Stating so doesn't make a man honorable.
Be smart about it Fabiha... don't trust blindly again.
I'm not being blind, I'm just trying to repay the favor.
If you want to return the favor, pay them back with money not your honor.
Alright fine, I'll do as you say!
I've made a decision about your life.
If you want to convince your mother, then move your life forwards.
Why did you try to act smart in front of mother? If you didn't know anything, you should have said so in front of mother...
But I saved you.
You made me look like the bad guy in front of mother...
I never understood you women... I stood by you and you're scolding me.
I don't want you to stand by me like this.
It seems that your mother scolded you a lot today. You're so angry.
Do you remember that today's dinner is with me, right?
I do.
Okay.
Mother, I need to check your sugar.
Fabiha will check in once she arrives. Go and prepare for work.
Fabiha can insert the insulin.
No!
She's the one who will check the sugar as well. Go...
Why aren't you ready for work?
I decided to spend time with the family, and go to work a little late.
That's why morning seems so special today.
I'll bring tea for you.
My dear... eat slowly. I can't breathe watching you eat so fast.
Sure mother.
Thank you so much. It's been a while since I've had your coffee.
Do you remember that you didn't go to work without drinking my coffee.
Yes, and your coffee still tastes the same.
Mother, do you want something?
When will Fabiha be here?
Start eating.
Coming!
Yes?
Is this miss Farheen's house?
This is your courier.
Haris must have sent me tickets from Muscat...
Sign here.
Mother... mother...
Mother where are you? Come outside!
What's all the noise?
Mother look at this... Haris sent me the ticket to Muscat.
He sent you a ticket? Are you sure?
I told you that Haris loved me...
Forget about six months, he couldn't live without me for four months. Do you believe me now?
Thank God Haris started using his brain. This is great.
Haris is so nice, you should have no suspicion now.
I believe you. Haris turned out to be an honest man.
He's very nice, are you happy now?
I'm very happy!
To tell you the truth, I didn't expect you to be so happy for me.
My dear... both of you are my children. I want both of my children to be happy.
I can't believe, I want to dance!
Open this up and see the dates on the tickets.
Oh yes! I didn't check the dates of the tickets.
Farheen... what's the matter?
Farheen? Show me...
What's this?
What has happened?
Farheen, everything is over. I told you...
That man isn't trustworthy.
What face will I show the world and my family?
What will I say?
My child...
Farheen.
Farheen.
Farheen.
My dear.
Don't worry.
God will make everything better.
This cannot be.
Haris...
Farheen...
Who are you making this coffee for?
For Arhum.
He drinks it before work. I was late today, but I'll make it two minutes.
Arhum has already had his coffee.
The kids are off to school, and mother's breakfast is ready. Insert the insulin to mother and server her breakfast.
The rest I'll take care of, just look after mother.
I'm really sorry you had to do everything yourself. Hamza was late today and there was a lot of traffic, that's why I couldn't make it on time.
I wasn't late because of you.
I'm going late because I want to. Before you came I was taking care of these responsibilities myself.
Responsibilities that have been handed to you in return of money.
These are my duties and I'm just fulfilling them.
Exactly how you're taking care of me and providing for your home.
Divorce?
This cannot be.
Haris cannot divorce me.
Haris cannot divorce me.
He cannot do this.
Farheen, what's the matter?
What are you doing?
What did Haris do to me?
What did he do? He ruined my life!
What did he do? I've been ruined! My life is over!
Leave me... let me be! Everything is over!
What should I do?
What should I do?
Here is your juice.
Hold this...
Thank you.
The phone is ringing.
Yes mother...
Fabiha come home quickly.
What's the matter, is everything alright?
What's that noise behind you? What's going on?
This is not the time to talk, come home quickly.
I'm coming.
My life is ruined... I will ruin everything.
Be strong my dear!
What has happened? Haris was supposed to call me to Muscat...
I did my packing... my clothes... my shoes...
Everything was inside my suitcase... what has happened?
What should I do? Will I not go to Muscat now? Haris has divorced me.
You will stay here.
I fought for my happiness.
Everything is over my dear...
Come to your senses...
Come to you senses...
I've come to my senses now... I revolted against you for this relationship.
What did I get for it? Haris divorced me!
He has labeled my a divorcee!
No mother... it's better if I die.
Farheen listen to me!
Hamza, pick up the phone.
What's the matter? Why are you worried?
Mother called, she sounded very worried.
I need to go home right now.
Sure go ahead.
Hamza is not picking up.
Ask Arhum to drop you.
No... I can go on my own.
How can you? You don't know what happened, and you need a man.
Go and call Arhum, I'll ask him to drop you. Go and call him.
Go ahead...
What's the matter? Why aren't you at work today? Won't you be late?
It's nothing... I was waiting for a meeting. The timing has been confirmed. I'm leaving.
Mr. Arhum and miss Shenaya, I need to go home.
Is everything alright?
Mother called, she sounded worried... she's asked me to be home.
And there was noise in the back as well.
Alright... don't worry. Arhum...
it's important to drop her off. Take her and I'll take an off from work.
Alright...
Let's go.
Farheen, listen to me!
Farheen... what are you doing?
What are you doing sister? Let go of this!
What's the matter with you?
My happiness is dead...
Let me die too.
What did brother Haris do?
Haris has divorced Farheen.
Sister...
I'm with Fabiha...
Greetings mother, how are you?
Greetings to you too... I'm well.
How are you? You didn't call me in a while, so I decided to call you.
Mother you know.. with work, I have to look after home as well.
Last week was very busy
I had to take an off from work today because Fabiha had an emergency with her family.
I was so busy that I couldn't call you.
I did talk to brother Junaid. Did you go to the doctor for your routine check up?
Yes Junaid and Somia took me..
The tests were great... tell me...
How are Hadi and Hareem?
Tell me how Arhum is as well.
The kids and Arhum are great...
Look at me... I am so busy...
that I forgot to give you good news...
Really... what good news...
Arhum has been promoted.
That's great! Many congratulations!
May God keep you and your husband happy.
Amen mother... I'm very happy as well.
I pray that my daughter remains happy.
And God save you from evil eyes.
Did Hamza not tel you?
No, he didn't tell us anything.
Did Hamza not tell you anything about sister's divorce?
It happened today.
Sister Shaheen I didn't know anything about this. If I did...
I wouldn't come here to ask a date for the wedding.
Enough sister... why are you killing yourself for that man?
I can't believe it.
He has betrayed me!
Haris has betrayed me!
Fabiha... please...
I didn't know that he would turn about to be such heartless man.
Control yourself please...
Be strong.
Look at me...
You're very strong.
I'm not... I don't have the strength in me anymore.
I'm tired..
Control yourself and look at me...
Did you talk to him... did he say something?
Did you two fight... tell me something.
He said that...
he would call me Muscat next week.
Did you say something that he minded?
Did you say something...
No.
Fabiha... we didn't fight.
I was just betrayed.
Sister... you weren't betrayed, he is the one who has suffered a loss.
He will regret it... he was lucky to have a girl like you.
Don't cry for no reason for that man...
You'll find a man a hundred times better.
What will I do now? Where will I go now?
All of us are with you... mother is here, I'm here.
I have become a divorcee!
Nothing has happened.
Everything is over.
Nothing is over... we're here for you.
Thank you my dear.
You came here to drop Fabiha..
No need... this was an emergency..
and I was obligated to help. Don't worry, everything will be well.
How can it my dear? The sister that Fabiha sacrificed for...
all was in-vain.
You still haven't left...
No... is she okay now?
How can a person be when walking over coals?
She's crying over her fate.
It takes time to recover from trauma, but everything will be alright, don't worry.
If God is willing.
I'll get going.
Sir...
Thank you so much.
See you late, bye
Thank you.
What's the matter? Why are you so worried?
How could I not worry?
Ma'am gave me the checks... and I cashed them myself.
I don't know how it got missed, and there's no record of it.
How will you get a record?
How come you gave that new cashier a check made out to cash...
He knows that you'll have to take a hit for it.
That's the issues and this will be checked in the audit tomorrow.
They will fire me.
There might be an issue with the audit... let me think of something.
Fabiha called me... I'll talk to you later... I have to call her.
Don't worry...
Hello... did you find the time to call me?
What's the matter? I was in a meeting...
Hamza, it's always the same thing with you... either it's a meeting or it's traffic.
You're not here when I need you. What should I do with such love?
You make such huge proclamations.
What happened?
Hamza, brother Haris has sent my sister divorce papers..
Thank God that Arhum dropped me home, otherwise I would have lost a lot of time because of you.
Sorry... I had no idea...
Come home quickly...
Lunch is ready... sandwich for you and French Fries for Hadi..
Mother... where's auntie Fabiha, she served us lunch every day.
Auntie Fabiha had to go home because of an emergency.
That's why I've taken a days off for you two.
Who will play puzzles with us today?
I will and I will win...
No...
What's the point in making the kids happy for a single day?
Hand me the phone... let me ask Fabiha what happened.
Bring it! Arhum...
Thank God you're here... what happened there?
Don't worry... everything is okay.
Did you not go to work?
No... I didn't go to work.
What happened that made her mother call her home?
Fabiha's elder sister has been divorced.
She was attempting suicide, that's why her mother called her. We reached there on time.
Thank God...
Please make me a cup of coffee Shenaya... I'm too tired. I'm going to my room.
Mother, I'll take you to your room.
Sure... take me. Thank you.
Was Fabiha worried?
Sister eat something.. you haven't eaten anything since morning.
I've made your favorite veggies...
Get up...
Eat a little bit.
Mother... I'm not hungry.
How long will you starve yourself?
You haven't eaten anything since morning. Eat a little bit.
Come on.
Fate has killed me.
Why do you want to keep me alive?
Sister, we can't change what happened. You will gain nothing by punishing yourself.
I should be punished.
Right mother?
I should be punished, right?
For that man and his love...
I suspected your love, forgive me mother.
What are you doing? Don't do this.
Look.
When emotion take over our mind..
we understand nothing.
When someone makes a joke out of our emotion?
Do we not understand it even then?
This love has ruined me.
Stop crying the two of you!
You should thank God that he left you? Just imagine what he would have done if he had taken you with him?
And mother... instead of making her understand you are crying.
Why am I explaining things to you?
It's been so many days since you called, so I decided to come here.
No... it's not like that.
I was about to call you.
But... I didn't get the chance.
Where is sister Farheen... I can't see her...
Farheen... she's not well. She's sleeping.
There is a virus going on, every home has a sick person.
Yes indeed.
I came here because of something important.
Is everything alright?
The thing is that... you're well now..
And next month is coming here from Hyderabad.
So I've decided to set the date for Hamza and Fabiha's wedding.
I don't want any refusals... please life this duty off of me.
It seems that you have listened to my heart. I want to do this duty as soon as possible.
Look... time doesn't remain the same.
First there's happiness, then sadness.
You're right about that. So give me a date.
I think...
How about the 18th?
It's settled then, I'll bring my brother's barat on the 18th.
If it were up to her she would do it today.
When is Farheen going away?
Did Hamza not tell you?
No... Hamza told me nothing...
Hamza didn't tell you anything about sister's divorce?
Divorce?
It happened today.
Sister Shaheen, I didn't know about this. If I had...
I would never have come here for the wedding date.
It's not your fault.
I'll win you'll see!
Oh no... okay... yes you win!
Let's start and see who wins this time...
What need was there to mention Farheen's name in front of sister Nasreen?
What was so wrong? How long would we have hidden it?
They would bound to know at some point.
Do you know the meaning of divorce?
No matter how innocent a woman is, people always ask question of the woman in a divorce. Do we have the answers?
Foolish girl... one has to be cautious in front of one's in-laws.
Mother... such a big tragedy has happened to sister and you're worried about me?
How hurt will she be when she finds out.
Let her wounds fill.
Fabiha... I'm a mother to both of you. I don't bad for anyone...
But after Farheen I'm concerned for you.
Lord knows what's written in her fate. But you shouldn't turn away from your fate.
Look, marry Hamza and go to your home.
Mother...
What do you want?
Do I want me to gamble your honor? Do you want me to listen to you?\
When did I say that? That will not happen now...
That will not happen. My decision is set in stone, there is no room for refusal.
The 18th... you'll be...
married on the 18th.
Make your home respectfully... or bury it like Farheen.
Get up from here.
Lord knows what will happen to these girls.
So you're here... why didn't you bring the barat?
What's the matter Fabiha?
You're asking that?
Like you know that your mother was coming to ask about the wedding date.
Did you know or not?
I did.
Do you think we can get married under the circumstances?
Sister is crying for her life and you want me to parade my happiness?
Do you think that everything will change after the wedding?
What will change? My life or the situation of this home?
Fabiha..
I didn't expect this from you.
Fabiha...
listen to me...
What should I listen to?
Is there anything left for you to say?
I was stuck with an issue from my office. They are about to fire me.
I didn't get the chance to talk to mother. Why are you so negative?
Will we spend our lives like this? Will you provide for me without a job?
Why are you getting so hyper? Let's talk it out.
Then do it... 
Until sister comes out of this trauma, I will not marry you.
