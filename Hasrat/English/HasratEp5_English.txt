I love you very much Junaid....
but that doesn't mean that I'll do what you ask of me.
If you pressurize me then...
I'll take Anayah and go to my mother. But...
I will never apologize to Shenaya's mother-in=law.
There is still time. Anyone in this world can get upset at us and it won't matter...
but when one's husband is upset, it seems as though the entire world has turned against us.
If mother leaves with me, then you'll lose your husband as well.
Uncle, you can let mother know about this detail.
Mother, talk to him.
Hello, greetings brother.
Yes I'm alright, how about you?
Yes... no brother...
I'm not upset at family. We're just compelled to be distant right now.
Otherwise blood relationships remain, long after one is buried.
Yes... Fareen told me that you want to call Haris to Muscat.
Yes he does have a passport...
Yes... he has passed his matriculation and...
he knows how to do electrical maintenance. Yes he does have a passport.
No brother...
I don't know what the fees is for the via and ticket.
How much will it be?
Alright.
Alright brother, I'll consider and call you back.
Sure.
Farewell.
What did uncle say... when is he sending the visa?
It's not like your uncle is the governer of Muscat, who'll sent the visa tomorrow morning, that too for free.
He's asking for four lac rupees, for the visa, residence and ticket.
And if he doesn't get a job then you can say a prayer for this relationship.
Mother four lacs is not that huge an amount.
Fabiha can take care of some of the amount... for the rest we have our jewelry.
Mother, apply for the visa. Once we get the visa we'll manage to get the rest of the money.
That's what I'm saying.
They are asking twenty five thousand for that, where will we get that from?
Mother, I'll do something, don't worry.
Mother please... I beg you... wait for the visa.
Please... mother I think you'll mess this up.
What will I do? You're not fated to marry Haris.
May God have mercy on me.
You are the one who proclaimed your love.
You promised to stay with me, listen to my needs and spend time with me.
There were never any conditions...
There were never any conditions.
That is the difference between the love of a husband and a wife.
For me, the love I have for you...
is the peace for my soul.
One can repay a loan any time... but in love...
one has to sacrifice oneself.
Alright fine.
If I have to sacrifice my motherhood, just so that I can prove my love for you...
then I swear on my child's life...
Neither my mother, nor my sister-in-law said anything.
Your mother was the one who cursed them.
What did I do?
What's the matter? You've taken such a trivial matter to heart.
You've broken my pride today.
I won't ever be able to trust you in life
You refusal has strangled my love.
Look Junaid... if I had to ask brother Arhum's forgiveness for Shenaya a thousand times...
I would do so, but I will not apologize to Shenaya's mother-in-law.
It's about a husband's right.
It is a husband's right to make his wife listen to his decision.
You stole this right from me.
Fine then... then I don't have any right to live here!
I'm leaving this house... you can save your sister's home!
Anayah! Anayah!
Mother, where are we going?
No more questions, wear your slippers, we're leaving.
What's the matter? Where are you going?
Mother, I'm leaving this home.
Have you gone mad? What's gotten into you?
What else should I do? I cannot live in a place where I get punished for no reason.
Don't take a hasty decision.
This is not a hasty decision.
Because of your daughter, my husband is upset with me
Who should I stay here for now?
Granny, make mother understand. I don't want to leave.
Do as I say!
Why are you scolding your child? You are not going anywhere, understand?
Mother, listen to me... I don't want another allegation falling on my head.
I have never refused anything you've said, please let me go.
My dear, I understand that you've never ignored anything that I've said...
and I'm really proud of that. But you can't leave home like this.
I order you not to leave this home...
Do you understand? I can only make you understand as a mother.
One shouldn't leave home like this.
Come on... keep this back in. As far as Junaid is concerned...
I will make him understand, he will listen to me.
He's upset for the time being... now wind this up.
My child is scared. I'm taking her to my room.
Hello... I've been trying to reach brother Junaid for a while, he's not picking up.
Why? Do you wish to say something to Junaid after talking to your mother?
He does listen to everything you say...
I'm sure he'll take me to apologize.
No... it's not like that.
Then what is it? Do you know for the first time in my life he left home without having breakfast.
And I can't even tell you how rude he was to me.
Do you know who the reason is for all this? It's you and your in-laws.
And I will never forgive you for this.
I'm really sorry... I never wanted this.
Brother can't be upset with you because of me. I'll make him understand.
He cannot pressurize you like this...
But I've made to be look like a bad wife...
No matter what you do now, I've made to be look like a bad wife because I didn't listen to his decision.
What's the point of it now? I was the fool who was after your children....
But I've decided now... whoever does bad to me, I will do bad to me.
Sister listen to me...
Listen to me... I'm sorry...
If I had know that our relationship was based on that...
I would have sworn on my daughter's life there and then.
Do you think apologizing will fix everything?
Will that clear things with my brother and his wife? Will things be life it was before?
I'll talk to mother, I'll make her understand... she'll agree.
Really...
Do you think that she'll acknowledge her mistake if you ask her to?
Will she think that my family is right?
I want things to stay inside our home.
Things are not inside the house.
It would have stayed inside this home, if it was not discussed outside.
I don't understand why you always realize things after you've done them.
You know I'm emtional.
I don't understand anything when I'm angry.
Anger always harms oneself.
The only way I'll be harmed is when you won't be with me.
That's what I like about you. You always stand by my side.
I promise...
No matter how bad things get I won't leave you.
I promise... please smile now.
On one condition...
What condition?
I want you to ask your mother to swear on your life and tell the truth.
Make this as well.
What's the matter? Why are you silent?
It's nothing...
What does that mean?
If you don't share things with me then who will you share it with? Tell me...
How do you know that I'm worried?
I'm not just your driver...
I love you a lot too... my heart is not dependent on your words.
I can take one look and tell what's going inside of you.
Tell me, otherwise I'll have to think of one or two more dialogues...
I'm worried because of sister. Brother Haris has asked for four lac rupees to go to Muscat.
I don't understand anything...
Look Fabiha...
Try and make your sister understand. Talk to her...
That guys is making your sister a fool.
Even if he goes to Muscat...
what will happen then? Do you think he'll take your sister with you?
Sister is not willing to listen. We've left this decision to her.
Please give it to us... I'm thirsty...
Improve your mood and take this.
This is my passport and this is my identity card. This is my mother's passport and identity card.
And these are the rest of my documents. I pray that I get my visa quickly.
Mother's passport?
Sister, what are you saying?
I'm an old woman, how will I live without my son? He's my only son.
I've decided that I'll go with Haris...
Besides... Fareen is here. She waited so long for Haris... and she can wait a little more...
And yes... one day she'll live with Haris...
Haris, I don't object you going abroad...
But... taking care of so many needs without a job...
how will you do it? Twenty five thousand is the fees for the visa. How will we get it?
Auntie... God provides everything. I'm sure He'll create a way.
Of course... why do you worry so much? Everything will be taken care of... don't worry.
Fabiha is there... I'm sure she can do as much for her sister.
I'm sure I can manage a few thousand rupees.
My dear...
A few thousand isn't enough to live life.
Auntie... money isn't everything. It's here one day and gone the next.
One shouldn't miss any opportunities...
I've even thought of a way to spend my life.
Really...
Farheen and I will earn and live in Muscat.
Right Farheen?
That's a great idea. You can earn and have fun.
But if the two of you have to earn...
then you guys can do it here in Pakistan. Why Muscat?
That's a good question...
I'm thinking of the future auntie.
You don't know about Muscat... my friends have gone far ahead in life after going to Muscat.
They've gone to London... Canada.. England...
Thailand...
Look..
If you don't take life seriously now...
then you'll wander life without achieving anything.
Mother... please.
Haris... have some tea.
Some biscuits too.
Auntie... you too...
Thank you my dear.
Auntie... I've packed my bags... I'm ready...
As soon as I get my visa, I'll leave Pakistan.
But don't worry... I'll only leave after marrying Farheen.
Don't worry...
You think quite a lot...
But... my decision is something else...
Farheen will not only be married...
she'll be sent away as well.
She'll go with you to Muscat.
This is my decision, the rest is up to you.
Why did you stop your hand?
Please eat... your tea is getting cold.
Eat...
May I come inside?
Come inside... you need not ask...
What's the matter? You look quite worried.
Yes...
There is no need for you to worry whilst I'm here.
Tell me... what can I do for you?
The thing is that...
Why are you so afraid?
Tell me what it is... without any worries.
I need four lac rupees... you can cut it from my salary.
Four lac rupees... it's not that much but...
may I ask why you need that amount?
My sister's in-laws have put forth the condition that if they don't send their son to Muscat, then they won't let him marry my sister.
And they will end the relationship.
So you're taking this money for your sister's happiness.
Of course... what sister wouldn't?
This is a check for four lac rupees...
five...ten...fifteen...twenty...twenty-five...thirty...thirty five....forty...forty-five...
this is fifty thousand as a wedding gift to your sister.
I don't need the gift...
Please it's a gift, keep it.
Please...
Thank you...
You're welcome.
Anything else...
No.. I'll get going.
The bird has trapped itself in a cage.
Mother, what's the matter? 
Brother, call the ambulance... call the doctor... I'll take a look, you go and call the ambulance.
Hadia, what is happening to her?!
Are you with the patient?
Yes I am... what has happened to her?
She had a very serious attack.
The next twenty four hours are very critical for her. Please pray.
That's what I was trying to tell you. What need was there that to discuss that with Haris?
That's what I've been trying to tell you for a while. I didn't say anything wrong.
You said nothing wrong? First it was my in-laws with the conditions and now it's you.
Mother, will my life will be lived on conditions.
Whatever decision I took is for your betterment.
Don't think of your mother as your enemy. Now enough of that and do the dishes.
I can do the dishes later, but what about you trying to wash away my life?
Mother, you've made yourself an enemy by saying that. If you don't want Haris to go to Muscat, then you should have refused.
Why did you make me your pawn?
You've sold your honor in gain of love.
You are questioning your mother's love for him?
Mother...
All my life I lived my life according to you, for once let me take my decision. I have no objections if Haris wants to leave after marrying me.
You will remember my decision and the things I've said.
But by then we won't be able to do anything, and you will have nothing left but tears.
There will be no one to ask you apart from your mother.
You can pray for my happiness, but you like to see tears in my eyes.
Now I'm going to do the dishes.
She's gone insane.
Be careful... don't take out your anger on the dishes. You've broken them in the past.
What's the matter mother? Will you keeping sitting like this, or will you say something?
I heard it.
Shenaya has put a condition in front of Arhum...
What condition?
That I...
should swear on Arhum's life...
and then say that Shenaya and her family are liars.
Mother, it's not a big deal. Things like these don't matter. It's not like you'll mean it.
Brother will ask you to do no such thing.
You'll only get sick.
If Arhum asks me?
What if he asks me to swear on his life and say that Shenaya and her family are liars...
then what Hadia...
will I purge myself and swear falsely on my son's life?
Then agree to it... swearing on his life won't change anything.
Remove these doubts from your heart. If you want you will imposed on this house, then make yourself strong.
Did you take your insulin? No, right? I'll be right back with it, alongside breakfast.
I'm worried about my son's life and you're worried about insulin.
You don't understand what I'm saying.
Stupid girl.
Morning everyone.
How are you all? I hope you guys are well.
There is a reason I've called this meeting today...
For so many years promotions have been pending for all of you.
Now it's time to announce your promotions.
I have the progress reports in front of you. On the basis of that we've decided promotions for all of you.
Mr. Javed, from now you'll be the new chief executive.
Miss Sofia, you'll be overtaking the finance department from now on...
Thank you...
The efforts that miss Shenaya has put into our Dubai project...
is amazing... and I give miss Shenaya all the credit.
Thank you sir...
The promotion list for all of you has been sent to the head of department...
and the last promotion for today is...
Miss Shenaya, alongside the design department, you'll be overlooking the marketing department as well.
Congratulations!
Thank you sir... thank you so much.
Congratulations ma'am.
I'm hopeful that you'll continue working this way.
Sure sir... and thank you for trusting me.
Arhum will be so happy once he finds out.
Come on... pick up the phone.
If you keep pacing like this, it will only increase your blood pressure.
He'll be here any moment now and I have no answer to his questions.
There is no need for you to answer his questions. I've been trying to tell you that for a while now.
It's not that big a deal... you can say anything.
Do you want some water?
What if he asks...
why we haven't left for Dubai.
You can tell him that we had the flight canceled.
What if she asks about Shenaya?
Mother...
Arhum... come in...
Greetings.
I thought you had your flight?
Mother wasn't feeling well, so I canceled it. Her bloods pressure was high, I gave her medicine, she'll be alright soon.
How are you feeling now?
I'm well.
I wanted to talk to you about something important.
Sure... what is it?
Look, don't take it the wrong way... I don't want to upset you...
Just swore on my life and tell me that you didn't curse sister Somia's daughter.
For me, please.
I know you didn't do it. You're my mother... and I know you could never do that.
I don't know why... just once, swear on my life.
Mother...
Mother, what happened?
Mother...
Call the ambulance... call the doctor...
Mother, open you eyes!
Mother...
Hadia, what's happening to her?
Mother... everything is fine now...
Mother... mother...
Mother... mother...
Brother!
Yes doctor...
Are you with the patient?
Yes... what has happened to my mother?
She has had a serious attack.
The next twenty four hours are very critical for her. Please pray for her.
Are you happy now?
Are you at peace bringing our mother to this point?
I can't believe that you compare you wife to your mother.
That you can question her on your wife's say so.
You did this because sister-in-law asked you, right?
Huh?
If something were to happen to her, have you ever thought how you would bury your mother with this guilt?
You angry right now... and one can't control their words and actions when one is angry.
Mother needs our prayers right now, not this.
If...
If anything happens to my mother...
I will not forgive you or your wife.
Shenaya is calling at this hour?
Hello...
Greetings mother.
Is everything alright my dear?
You sound worried... is everything alright?
Mother is not well... she's in the hospital... the next twenty four hours are very critical.
May God have mercy... what happened?
Don't worry... God will make everything alright. Be Arhum's strength right now... he needs you the most right now.
Forget everything my dear.
You being upset doesn't matter when it comes to relationships...
Take care of yourself and don't worry.
If every mother is life... then no woman would have a troubled household.
Where are you right now?
I'm at home with the kids. Arhum and Hadia are at the hospital alone.
Mother can't you come here with brother to stay with the kids...
so that I can go to the hospital. I'm sure Arhum must be feeling alone right now.
Don't worry at all... I'll send Junaid right away.
Thank you mother.
Farewell*
What are you doing up? Don't you have to go in the morning?
I have to...
I came to give this to you.
What is this?
Four lac rupees.
How can someone give you such a hefty amount?
I took it from my employer.
Such a big amount. How can he give this to you?
Maybe because he was sympathetic.
Sympathy? For what?
One can only be sympathetic to a lonely woman.
You shouldn't have taken a favor like this from someone.
You shouldn't have told him about your problems.
Men know how to take advantage of compulsions. We could have taken a loan from the bank.
And returned eight lac rupees?
Like our life... it's not easy to take a loan from the bank.
God took us so far... I'm sure he'll take us the rest of the way.
Don't worry... apply for brother Haris's visa.
Alright... fine.
You can have it cut from your salary. But we'll have to cut down on our rations.
Now take your medicine.
Don't worry.
Are you still upset?
Does it make a difference to you if I am?
Why? Do you think you being upset makes no difference to me?
No... because if it did...
Then you wouldn't have hurt my heart this way.
Then how will this heart mend?
Why are you being so romantic now? Who asked you to?
I don't need someone else to tell me to be romantic with my wife.
Then why does your sister become cause for you to hate your wife?
Yes mother... is everything alright?
Shenaya just called... it's not good news..
Shenaya's mother-in-law is in a bad condition. She's in the ICU and she had a stroke...
Drop me off at Shenaya's home with the kids and take Shenaya to the hospital.
Arhum is alone...
Let's go.. where are my keys?
Mother... I'll come along as well.
Hurry up.
Have some water.
I won't eat or drink anything until mother wakes up.
Mother will be fine... have some faith in God and eat something.
I trusted you didn't I...
And look what you did to my mother.
Control yourself, this is the hospital.
Arhum... how's mother feeling now... what are the doctors saying...
The doctors haven't provided us with any hope.
Nothing will happen to her, don't worry.
I'm here with you, don't worry.
Arhum...
Be strong, everything will be alright.
I made a mistake.
My mother raised me without my father and I tested my mother with what the truth was.
Don't hold yourself responsible. No one can fight with fate... not even time.
Everything will be alright.
Hadia...
Don't worry... auntie will be fine.
I don't need your sympathies...
