My decision is different.
My decision is that Farheen just won't be married...
she'll be sent away as well.
She will go with you to Muscat...
Hadia what is happening to her!
Are you with the patient?
Yes... what's wrong with my mother?
She had a serious attack.
The next twenty four hours are critical for her.
Pray for her.
Hadia..
Don't worry... auntie will be fine.
I don't need you sympathies, understand?
Hadia...
What?
What? Why are they here? To watch a scene?
All of this is happening because of them. Are they here to watch my mother die?
Hadia... this is not the time for all this.
Besides... relatives are supposed to help one another in such moments.
I have no relationship with you.
The ones I do have a relationship, they have become the cause for my mother's condition.
She tried to snatch a mother of her son.
I will not forgive you. What you did will come back to haunt you one day.
All of this will happen to you. You will regret it.
Mother has heard everything. My mother is in this condition because she overheard your conversation with my brother.
Hadia silence yourself.
Why should I be silent? Why are they here? Get out!
Arhum... what are you doing?
Don't you see what she's doing?
I apologize on her behalf. She's just being emotional, that's it.
Arhum... we can understand.
Arhum.
You shouldn't have raised your hand on your sister. She's married after all.
What will she think?
You insulted her in front of my family.
I didn't want to do this. But it was important to show my sister her limits.
There are other ways to do that. You slapped her in front of everyone.
Sisters are supposed to feel secure with their brothers.
And by slapping her you've taken that security away from her.
What else should I have done?
Arhum... she was upset.
If she was upset... then you should have tried to make her feel better.
You entangled her even more. If there are distances among relationships then that can lead to misunderstandings.
Girls who have no father look towards their brothers for security.
And someone who only has one brother...
who will she go to if her only brother turns away from her?
Talk to her and make her understand.
Cheer her up.
I will have my revenge tenfold for the insult I've had to endure today.
You are proud of your relationship, right? My name isn't Hadia if I don't destroy your relationship.
Hadia...
My mother hasn't stopped breathing...
and you've already started to distance yourself from me.
Is this how brothers and sisters supposed to be?
Are we supposed to stand in front of each other in our bad times?
If it is like that, then I wish that I never had a brother.
Hadia..
forgive me... I shouldn't have raised my hand on you.
You raised me like a father...
you never managed to bring tears to my eyes...
But today you laid it all to waste.
Thank God that this is a hospital and not something that you own with your wife.
Otherwise you would have shoved me out of this.
Anyways... it's alright.
I came here for two months..
but I don't think I'll be able to manage to live two days here.
Hadia that house still belongs to your father...
You can live there as long as you want. No one can ask you to leave.
Nor will they... I promise you that.
Your promises...
You should tell that to your wife.
Me and my mother...
Forget it...
Yes doctor...
The good news is that the patient is awake.
The bad news is that because of a serious attack, half her body has become paralyzed.
She needs attention and care. There is a chance that physiotherapy might fix her.
Hi... happy birthday.
I wanted to wish you before my sister-in-law, but I'm married now and you've become second fiddle.
Why are you lying? And if you are lying then at least put some effort into it. You forgot, didn't you?
At least you remembered.
The one I was waiting for hasn't wished me yet.
Forget about that, and tell me what gift you got from her.
It's actually a surprise... so I don't know.
Surprise? Now don't tell me that going outside with her is a surprise, now tell me where you're going out with her.
That is a surprise as well. I have to call a client, be right back.
Should I make you a cup of coffee?
Yes please...
We will eat... so that we have energy...
Here you are.
We will eat will our stomach are full.
You are so strong... you do everything yourself.
Wow!
Hello...
I admit that I love you more Fabiha... but that doesn't mean that you find yourself so busy that you forget about me.
What's the matter, why are you saying such things?
That's the thing, you don't understand me, nor do you see my love.
Nor do you care about me, if you had then you would have given importance to the things that concern me.
Whether that be my love for you, or my birthday.
I'm so sorry Hamza, I don't know how I forgot...
Just don't forget me.
Anyways... I can ignore these minor mistakes...
but yes... I haven't forgiven you yet...
when you will have dinner with me... I don't want to hear any excuses. So tell that to your boss.
Alright I will...
I'll pick you up... I'll be there by four.
Okay done.
Hamza...
Happy birthday.
I was waiting for it...
I'll see you in the evening.
Farewell*
Sorry auntie... it was from home.
Good...
Sister... what can I say? I have been waiting for this day for ages...
We didn't do anything because we were compelled. I told Haris...
that once he gets his visa, I'll get him married to Farheen.
Now sister... what date have you decided for the marriage?
Whatever you think is right.
The how about the sixteen of this month?
Alright...
Many congratulations to you.
Where is Farheen? She should be offering us something sweet.
I'll call her... Farheen!
My dear Farheen...
Yes mother?
My dear I think there are some sweet meats in the fridge, please bring them.
Sister... I wanted to sow Farheen's dress...
But you know we have to prepare to leave... we don't have much time.
So...
My dead this is some money... you can buy whatever you want.
Bless you... and have this sweet meat.
Here you go...
You scared me mother...
I'm fine Hadia...
Nothing has happened to me.
If something would have happened to me, then I would never have forgiven myself.
You tried your best to kill her.
Thank God she was saved.
Otherwise you two had fully prepared...
Just do me one favor...
The hospital bill...
you can clear it.
Otherwise I'll be taunted for the rest of my life that my life was saved because of your wife.
Mother, right now you need to rest. Don't worry about this, your son will pay the bill.
If you want my mother not to be worried...
then please go... leave mother alone.
Thank God... sister Rafat has gained consciousness.
Thank God...
Yes you are right. Arhum was very worried.
But what Arhum did wasn't right...
What he did was right.
I was please by what he did. This how such sisters are supposed to be treated.
That too in front of his in-laws.
No matter what, Arhum shouldn't have raised his hand on his sister
What did he prove by raising his hand on his sister?
I didn't sit right with me.
Do you accept this from your brother?
What are you saying? There is a difference between Hadia and I...
I'm not jealous of my sister-in-law, nor do I humiliate her family.
When things are going bad people tend to change their behavior.
No... Hadia's behavior doesn't change with time, it changes because of her mother.
Anyways... whatever it maybe...
It's good that brother Arhum was present there.
Otherwise we would have been blamed for this...
Then I'm sure he would have asked his sister-in-law to go there and apologize.
I'll refill it.
It tastes delicious.
Brother Baksh...
Yes madam?
Are you leaving?
Madam, where can I go? Sir doesn't let me go. I'm here twenty four hours.
I don't know what's gotten into him today, he's given me a day off, even though I didn't ask for one.
Otherwise he doesn't let me go, even if my son is sick. I have to plead just to get an hour off.
Do you have something for me?
I wanted to ask if he was home?
Yes he's been here for a while. I've even served him tea.
Alright... that's all I wanted to ask.
Should I leave then? Farewell*
It's you... now that you're here, please lay out a shirt for me that you like.
Pardon?
Shirt.
Why did you come to see me?
I wanted to go home early today.
Why?
My mother isn't well and I need to take her to the doctor.
I gave Pir Baksh a day off, I thought that you would cook dinner, but it's alright...
I'll order something.
Tell me what I should make.
Leave it... I don't want to bother you.
It's not a bother at all. Tell me what you want to eat.
Are you sure?
Yes...
Then make me whatever you want.
Alright...
Thank you.
What happened to granny?
Nothing my dear, she isn't well... the doctor has asked her to rest.
Muskan said that granny broke her leg.
That she's become a cripple.
Behave! This is no way.
She's a child... calm down.
Leave it... it's not the child's fault...
She'll say what she hears. And both of your children spend time with your family.
I've brought home cooked food for you. It's lentils, I know you like it.
What are you trying to say? That my mother is now dependent on you.
Are you saying that from now you'll make choices for her?
What are you saying Hadia? I didn't mean it like that.
Why are you putting such things in her head?
What should I say then? That you are a good woman...
Who's away from her job to take care of her. If only you were that good.
If I had known that you were such poisonous, I would never have let my brother marry you.
I will take my brother away from you, remember that.
The doctor has discharged you. Thank God it isn't something that will make us keep you here.
I won't go back in that house.
What do you mean?
I've talked to my sister-in-law... we'll stay there for a few days.
After that we'll leave for Dubai.
Don't say nonsense, mother will come with me.
I've already talked to her.
I don't want to fall into an argument.
Alright then, I'll go alone.
What are you saying? You won't look nice staying with your sister-in-law.
Will I look nice if I stay with your husband?
Now that you're concerned about looking bad, you've changed your tone.
Don't be stubborn. We can talk over about what happened.
Your brother broke your pride, but don't do the same to me. Please come home with me.
We'll talk at home.
Hey... what did you do?
You've burnt it..
This is all because of me. If I hadn't asked you to stay, you wouldn't have cooked and burned your hand like this. I'm really sorry.
No... it's an ordinary wound, I'll be alright.
This is no ordinary... look at how burned this is...
Let me fix this...
I'm trying to make it better... what else?
This is a wound...
It won't get better by you doing nothing.
It will get better.
What about...
the wound that you've inflicted on my heart?
I don't understand.
I have a lot of pain here.
Look at this... feel it...
There is so much pain here...
Let go of my hand!
Why are you getting scared?
There is nothing to be scared of!
My heart has fallen for you.
You are being rude!
Now that you've understood that I'm being rude, I'm sure you know the reason behind it...
Let's have a mutual understanding of this.
I won't have to force you, because if I do then you won't be able to tolerate it...
If I had known that you were such a foul man I would never have entered your home!
Now that you've known that my intention aren't good... then...
Don't come near me!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me...
What did I do? I'm really sorry...
I shouldn't have done this.
Are you insane?
I had gone insane!
Stay away!
What was I doing? I shouldn't have done it...
Get away!
Fabiha!
Fabiha... my dear... what happened?
I'm here... tell me what happened.
Fabiha I'm asking you something... tell me...
He tried to force himself on me!
Hamza...Hamza.
No... please...
Let's go from here...
You can't do that.
For this beating...
I'll have my revenge.
I will make you regret it...
and that is a promise.
Be careful..
Mother what happened to granny?
Nothing my dear, she's not well, the doctor has asked her to rest.
But Muskan said that she had broke her leg and that she's a cripple now.
Behave... this is no way!
Arhum, she's a child, calm down.
Leave it brother. It's not her fault, she'll only speak what she heard her elders say.
And both of your children stay with your family.
But Muskan told me this auntie...
My children don't lie Hadia...
Children who are raised without parents can't distinguish between right and wrong.
My mother is the one who doesn't say anything, otherwise you can have my mother-in-law as a grand mother as well.
Don't argue, mother needs to rest.
Take them away...
Come on...
Mother... she's a child...
She didn't mean it that way...
She called me a cripple.
Arhum that word has never been spoken in our home.
Where did she learn it from?
Curse that foul man!
He tried to damage our honor!
If Hamza hadn't reached there on time...
then Lord knows what might have happened.
Hamza... my dear...
Not only Fabiha...
but also I won't be able to pay you back for this.
I didn't do you any favor auntie.
I respected my honor.
That was my duty...
Bless you my dear...
Bless you.
I never trusted that foul man...
Why would a man...
give four lac rupees without an ulterior motive?
Stop crying my dear...
Stop crying.
Get me some water.
Hadia!
Hadia!
Is mother sleeping?
Whatever happened...
was not good.
I tolerated my embarrassment.
I have only one brother...
and I can't leave him for the world.
But you... you are willing to leave your mother for this world.
What should I have done?
Is this a question?
Ask sister to leave her job.
This is the time to make this decision.
You won't get back lost time and like that you won't get your parents back.
Mother is dependent on you brother...
Like you're his only son... Hadi is your only son as well..
Whatever you do with your mother today, will be done to you tomorrow.
Mother...
Mother...
You could have called me if you wanted something. You could have hurt yourself.
I didn't call you once...
I called you ten time. No one listened.
I would have preferred dying than being dependent on my children.
I would have accountable for my deeds then.
Don't lose hope...
I'm your son and I'm here with you.
Mother we were here and we didn't hear you. No one comes on a single call.
You could have waited...
No one will come, even if I call them ten times.
What's with you mother? We came here as soon as we heard the glass... why won't we come if you call us?
I'll have a bell installed tomorrow... please don't cry.
What did you want? I was thirsty and wanted to drink water...
Water...
I'll give mother her medicine... ask sister-in-law to clean this broken glass.
There are kids at home... I don't want anyone getting hurt.
Shenaya... be careful..
What's the matter mother?
Please have this cleaned.
Alright don't cry...
Please...
